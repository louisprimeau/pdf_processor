Owing to the unique combination of physical properties such as high melting point, hardness, and thermal and chemical stability, metal-boron compounds have found different applications.1,2 The discovery3 of superconductivity in metallic MgB_{2} at the unexpected T_{\rm c} of 39 K has caused great interest in other transition-metal diborides that show lower T_{\rm c} values. Related experimental efforts have recently been extended to a wider class of binary boron-containing intermetallic compounds, in particular, to zirconium dodecaboride.4,5

Measurements on polycrystalline ZrB_{12} (as well as on many other boron-rich compounds) were done by Matthias _et al._6 where T_{\rm c}=5.82 K was determined from the sharp transition in specific heat data. (Our estimate for T_{\rm c} detected by dc magnetization measurements agrees with the value7 of T_{\rm c}\approx 6.0 K). Despite assertions that the ZrB_{12} phase exists only at high temperatures,8 large high-quality single crystals of ZrB_{12} were grown in Kiev9 and by Leithe-Jasper _et al._10 Whereas this work10 reported only crystallographic data for the crystals, two groups4,5 have performed investigations of ZrB_{12} single crystals grown in Kiev9 by different physical methods. Some unexpected results have been derived, and different conclusions relating to the nature of superconductivity in this compound were claimed. Gasparov _et al._4 observed a linear temperature dependence of the magnetic field penetration depth below 3 K, which contradicts the standard BCS theory, and proposed a d-wave-like pairing in ZrB_{12}. On the other hand, Daghero _et al._,5 based on resistivity versus temperature data and the well-known McMillan formula for T_{\rm c}, concluded that ZrB_{12} is a conventional s-wave superconductor with a zero-temperature energy-gap value D(0) =0.97 meV and the ratio 2\Delta(0)/T_{\rm c}=3.64. The same authors5 have also measured point-contact conductance spectra that were found to be dominated by features (typical of an s-wave superconductor but with the value D(_T_)=0.97 meV at T nearly 4 K [the BCS model yields 2\Delta(0)/T_{\rm c}=4.8]. The only issue that the two groups4,5 agree on is that the single crystals studied are type-II superconductors with an upper critical field H_{\rm c2}(0) above 1000 Oe, as estimated in Ref. 4 from resistance measurements, and in Ref. 5 as the field in which the Andreev-reflection features in conductance characteristics disappear.

In this work, we have studied tunneling and magnetic characteristics of ZrB_{12} single crystals grown in Kiev. The measurements were performed for temperatures ranging from above T_{\rm c} down to 4.2 K, where analytical expressions obtained within the standard Ginzburg-Landau approximation11 may be applied. In the following, we address two issues: the pairing symmetry in ZrB_{12} single crystals and whether they are really type-II superconductors. We have also studied surface characteristics with linear and non-linear ac magnetic response measurements. Chemically, dodecaborides are the extremely stable materials in comparison with other borides and are characterized by a strong surface resistance to mechanical and chemical factors.12 The difference between surface and bulk properties is discussed.

Large rods of ZrB_{12} single crystals were grown by the Kiev group with typical dimensions of about 6 mm in diameter and up to 40 mm in length. A 10.3\times 3.2\times 1.2 mm^{3} rectangular sample was cut from the rod and was polished mechanically by diamond and chemically etched in a boiling HNO_{3}/H_{2}O 1:1 mixture for 10 min to remove the Beibly layer. Room-temperature x-ray diffraction measurements performed in Kiev and in Jerusalem confirmed that the ZrB_{12} sample is a single-phase material with a UB_{12} structure [the space group of Fm3m, a =7.407 A (Ref. 13)].

The order parameter symmetry of ZrB_{12} was studied by scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements of current-voltage (_I_-_V_) curves. In contrast to the point-contact technique,5 the differential conductance dI/dV vs V yields direct information on the local quasiparticle density of states, and hence on the superconductor gap symmetry. The samples were carefully cleaned with ethanol in an ultrasonic bath just before they were mounted into our cryogenic homemade scanning tunneling microscope.[14] Before inserting He exchange gas (through a trap) the sample space was evacuated and the device was dipped into a liquid-helium storage Dewar. After a sufficiently long thermalization period the sample temperature was somewhat above 4.2 K, but lower than 4.4 K, as was indicated by a sensor placed nearby. Tunneling measurements were performed for junction normal-state resistances between 50 and 500 M\Omega. _I-V_ characteristics were differentiated numerically in order to obtain normalized spectra (dI/dV)_{S}/(dI/dV)_{N}, the ratios of differential conductances in superconducting and normal states. The spectra were compared with a temperature-smeared[15] version of the Dynes formula[16] that takes into account the effect of incoherent scattering events inside a superconductor, by introducing a damping parameter \Gamma into the conventional _s_-wave BCS expression for a normalized quasiparticle density of states N(\varepsilon) = \text{Re}\left[ \left( \varepsilon - i\Gamma \right)/\sqrt{\left( \varepsilon - i\Gamma \right)^{2} - \Delta(T)^{2}} \right\rbrack.

The well reproducible local tunneling characteristics (Fig. 1) did not change significantly with the tip position and/or the device settings. All curves demonstrated coherence peaks with a pronounced minimum at _V_=0 and a near-gap structure symmetrical with respect to the bias voltage V. Gap values \Delta(T = 4.2 K) were found to be 0.97 +- 0.01 meV (which coincides well with point-contact findings[5] for the same temperature) with \Gamma not exceeding 0.15 meV. A relatively small value of the damping factor (in particular, compared with those in Ref. 5) is believed to prove the high quality of the sample surface. For all tip positions we have not observed any signs of a zero-bias peak known as a fingerprint of the _d_-wave pairing[17] and, hence, may reject the assumption about an unusual symmetry of the order parameter in ZrB_{12}.

The latter statement was also confirmed by zero-field-cooling dc magnetization _M_-vs-_H_ measurements performed using a commercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS) with external magnetic fields aligned parallel to the long axis of the sample. In the normal state (above 6 K) the dc susceptibility \chi_{\text{dc}} = M/H is diamagnetic as expected.[7] Figure 2 shows the magnetization curves measured at various temperatures, corrected by the demagnetization factor N. Usually, when the external field is parallel to the long axis of a parallelepiped, N is small (the reduction in the H is a few percent) and can be neglected. However, for a sharp transition (as in our case) its width is of the same order as this reduction and more detailed analysis is needed. Using the expressions for an ellipsoid[18] and interpolating between the extreme cases that correspond to two different transverse sizes, _N_=0.06 was chosen. After this correction, the nearly vertical magnetization curves were obtained as shown in Fig. 2. This vertical shape close to the critical field values and the tiny hysteresis loops observed (not shown in Fig. 2) lead to the conclusion that bulk ZrB_{12} is a type-I superconductor or, alternatively, a type-II superconductor in which the Ginzburg-Landau parameter k is slightly above the marginal value of k = 0.71.[11]

From the data presented in Fig. 2 we can estimate the thermodynamic critical fields _H_c, whose equivalent magnetic energy is equal to the area under the measured _M_-vs-_H_ dependence \int_{0}^{\chi}[ - M(H)]dH = H_{\text{c}}^{2}/(8\pi). According to the standard BCS theory for an _s_-wave superconductor, the critical field curve _H_c(_T_) should saturate at low temperatures and be linear in the vicinity of T = _T_c.[11]

\[H_{\text{c}}(T) = 1.735H_{\text{c}}(0)(1 - T/T_{\text{c}}).\] (1)

The latter analytical result allows us to prove the conventional symmetry of the pairing in ZrB_{12} and to determine its _T_c value. Experimental data shown in Fig. 2 agreed very well with the linear dependence (1) (the derivative [dH_{\text{c}}(T)/dT]_{T = T_{\text{c}}} was equal to -110 Oe/K) and an extrapolation of _H_c(_T_) to zero yielded _T_c = 6.06 K. Now it is possible to use the empirical formula

\[H_{\text{c}}(T) = H_{\text{c}}(0)[1 - (T/T_{\text{c}})^{2}\rbrack,\] (2)

which interpolates the overall behavior of _H_c(_T_) between T =0 and T = _T_c, to estimate the zero-temperature thermodynamic critical field. Figure 2 (inset) yields _H_c(0) as 390 Oe. Using the density of states at the Fermi energy calculated recently for ZrB_{12} by Shein and Ivanovskii[19]N(\varepsilon_{P}) = 1.687 1/(eV cell) and the bulk energy-gap value of 0.97 meV from Ref. 5, one can estimate the condensation energy within the BCS theory and to evaluate the thermodynamic critical field

  H_{\rm c}(0). The value obtained is nearly 300 Oe, which compares reasonably well with our estimation of H_{\rm c}(0) listed above. Again, we see no reason to suppose any deviation from the conventional gap symmetry and the phonon origin of the Cooper pairing in ZrB_{12}.

More problematic is the question about the electron-phonon coupling strength. As was pointed out by Rammer, [20] the ratio H_{\rm c}(0)/(T_{\rm c}[dH_{\rm c}/dT]_{T=T_{\rm c}}) can serve as its indicator. In the weak-coupling limit it equals 0.58, as follows from Eq. (1), whereas strong-coupling effects lead to a significant reduction of this quantity. [20] In our case, this ratio equals to 0.59 which, together with the conclusions of the resistivity measurements [5] places ZrB_{12} into the category of weak-coupling superconductors. At the same time, using the temperature dependence of the BCS energy gap [11] and our value for the energy gap at T = 4.2 K, we obtain \Delta(0) = 1.21\,-1.24 meV in excellent agreement with \Delta(0) = 1.22 meV extrapolated in Ref. [5] from point-contact measurements. In this case the ratio 2\Delta(0)/T_{\rm c}, the characteristic of the electron-phonon coupling strength, [21] equals 4.75\,\pm\,0.10, indicating clearly an extremely strong electron-phonon interaction. According to Ref. [21], there is a general trend of the 2\Delta(0)/T_{\rm c} growth with increasing T_{\rm c}/\omega_{\rm ln} (\omega_{\rm ln} is a characteristic energy of lattice vibrations) and for 2\Delta(0)/T_{\rm c} = 4.75, \omega_{\rm ln} should be as great as 0.15. [21] The presence of such low phonon energies is doubtful, and, to explain this result, we assume that the order parameter is higher near the sample surface. In particular, it should lead [22] to a surface nucleation fields H_{\rm c3} larger than those expected for a uniform sample.

To study the superconducting sheath state in the field range H_{\rm c}<H<H_{\rm c3}, we applied an additional small ac magnetic field h(t) upon the coaxial dc field H and detected the linear and nonlinear responses. [23] The measurements have been done with our original homemade setup [24] adapted to the MPMS SQUID magnetometer. In linear experiments the ac field h(t) = h_{0}\cos\Omega t with 0< h_{0}< 0.4 Oe and \Omega/2\pi = 1455 Hz was generated by a copper solenoid inside the magnetometer and the ac susceptibility versus H was measured by the two-coil method. To study nonlinear characteristics of the sample, the ac perturbation had the form of an amplitude-modulated ac field h(t) = h_{0}(1+\alpha\cos\Omega t)\cos\omega t with two additional parameters \alpha = 0.9 and \omega/2\pi = 3.2 MHz (see for details Ref. [24], where the same technique was applied to a Nb single crystal) and the amplitude of a rectified signal at the modulation frequency A_{\Omega} was measured as a function of the dc field H.

Figure 3(a) exhibits a gradual shift of the real part \chi^{\prime} of the ac susceptibility compared with \chi_{\rm dc} calculated from dc magnetization curves. Such behavior was explained in Ref. [23] as an impact of the surface superconductivity that appears in perfect samples in a dc field parallel to the sample surface and persists in a surface region adjacent to a vacuum interface up to a field H_{\rm c3}. Near T_{\rm c}H_{\rm c3} is defined by a simple relation H_{\rm c3} = 2.38\kappa H_{\rm c}. [11] The shift between ac and dc susceptibility curves strongly depends on the amplitude and frequency of the ac field h(t) and, because of that, any interpretation and determination of a critical field value H_{\rm c} based on ac techniques should be done carefully. The nonlinear response A_{\Omega} was detected only above H_{\rm c} [Fig. 3(b)] where \chi_{\rm dc} vanishes, and hence the sample bulk was in a normal state. It corresponds to the direct observations [23] of a nonlinear nature of the response wavefront when a sinusoidal ac field is applied to a specimen in a superconducting sheath state. Variations of h_{0} cause identical behavior of A_{\Omega} in a Nb single crystal [24] where the presence of surface superconductivity was proven by different authors (see, for example, Ref. [25]). In our case, the ratio H_{\rm c3}/H_{\rm c} near T_{\rm c} is about 1.8. For a vacuum interface, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter should exceed the marginal value of \kappa = 0.71, which divides type-I and type-II superconductors. But if the order parameter increases near the interface (as it is argued above), then the ratio of the surface nucleation field H_{\rm c3} to the thermodynamic critical field can be dramatically enhanced (see Fig. 1 in Ref. [22]). Then our data could be interpreted with an assumption of type-I superconductivity. Additional experiments are needed to define the value of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter in ZrB_{12} single crystals.

In conclusion, we have proven experimentally that ZrB_{12} single crystals are conventional s-wave superconductors with enhanced surface characteristics. The latter statement can principally explain the difference in estimations of the electron-phonon coupling strength and of critical magnetic fields between the three studies performed on the same single crystals. More investigations are needed to explain all findings in this nontrivial material, in particular, the absence of the field direction effect reported in Ref. [5] (note that surface superconductivity should be strongly suppressed when the magnetic field has a component normal to the surface). We believe that zirconium dodecarboride is an interesting and fruitful compound for future experiments because of three reasons. First, due to excellent surface properties it can serve as a very suitable model material for studying specific near

  surface superconducting properties that are not yet well understood.[25] Second, our experiments show that it is an unusual marginal superconductor near the border between type-I and type-II superconductors. And last, ZrB_{12} (similar to other dodecaborides) rises above conventional materials due to its outstanding resistance to external mechanical and chemical factors. We believe that its unique material properties and comparatively simple superconducting characteristics will attract the attention of the applied physics community to the compound, which can find its place among various superconducting bulk applications where strong abrasion- and chemical-resistant properties are required.

Using the expressions for an ellipsoid[18] and interpolating between the extreme cases that correspond to two different transverse sizes, _N_=0.06 was chosen. After this correction, the nearly vertical magnetization curves were obtained as shown in Fig. 2. This vertical shape close to the critical field values and the tiny hysteresis loops observed (not shown in Fig. 2) lead to the conclusion that bulk ZrB_{12} is a type-I superconductor or, alternatively, a type-II superconductor in which the Ginzburg-Landau parameter k is slightly above the marginal value of k = 0.71.[11]

From the data presented in Fig. 2 we can estimate the thermodynamic critical fields _H_c, whose equivalent magnetic energy is equal to the area under the measured _M_-vs-_H_ dependence \int_{0}^{\chi}[ - M(H)]dH = H_{\text{c}}^{2}/(8\pi). According to the standard BCS theory for an _s_-wave superconductor, the critical field curve _H_c(_T_) should saturate at low temperatures and be linear in the vicinity of T = _T_c.[11]

\[H_{\text{c}}(T) = 1.735H_{\text{c}}(0)(1 - T/T_{\text{c}}).\] (1)

The latter analytical result allows us to prove the conventional symmetry of the pairing in ZrB_{12} and to determine its _T_c value. Experimental data shown in Fig. 2 agreed very well with the linear dependence (1) (the derivative [dH_{\text{c}}(T)/dT]_{T = T_{\text{c}}} was equal to -110 Oe/K) and an extrapolation of _H_c(_T_) to zero yielded _T_c = 6.06 K. Now it is possible to use the empirical formula

\[H_{\text{c}}(T) = H_{\text{c}}(0)[1 - (T/T_{\text{c}})^{2}\rbrack,\] (2)

which interpolates the overall behavior of _H_c(_T_) between T =0 and T = _T_c, to estimate the zero-temperature thermodynamic critical field. Figure 2 (inset) yields _H_c(0) as 390 Oe. Using the density of states at the Fermi energy calculated recently for ZrB_{12} by Shein and Ivanovskii[19]N(\varepsilon_{P}) = 1.687 1/(eV cell) and the bulk energy-gap value of 0.97 meV from Ref. 5, one can estimate the condensation energy within the BCS theory and to evaluate the thermodynamic critical field

The inset shows the initial current-voltage characteristic.

  H_{\rm c}(0). The value obtained is nearly 300 Oe, which compares reasonably well with our estimation of H_{\rm c}(0) listed above. Again, we see no reason to suppose any deviation from the conventional gap symmetry and the phonon origin of the Cooper pairing in ZrB_{12}.

More problematic is the question about the electron-phonon coupling strength. As was pointed out by Rammer, [20] the ratio H_{\rm c}(0)/(T_{\rm c}[dH_{\rm c}/dT]_{T=T_{\rm c}}) can serve as its indicator. In the weak-coupling limit it equals 0.58, as follows from Eq. (1), whereas strong-coupling effects lead to a significant reduction of this quantity. [20] In our case, this ratio equals to 0.59 which, together with the conclusions of the resistivity measurements [5] places ZrB_{12} into the category of weak-coupling superconductors. At the same time, using the temperature dependence of the BCS energy gap [11] and our value for the energy gap at T = 4.2 K, we obtain \Delta(0) = 1.21\,-1.24 meV in excellent agreement with \Delta(0) = 1.22 meV extrapolated in Ref. [5] from point-contact measurements. In this case the ratio 2\Delta(0)/T_{\rm c}, the characteristic of the electron-phonon coupling strength, [21] equals 4.75\,\pm\,0.10, indicating clearly an extremely strong electron-phonon interaction. According to Ref. [21], there is a general trend of the 2\Delta(0)/T_{\rm c} growth with increasing T_{\rm c}/\omega_{\rm ln} (\omega_{\rm ln} is a characteristic energy of lattice vibrations) and for 2\Delta(0)/T_{\rm c} = 4.75, \omega_{\rm ln} should be as great as 0.15. [21] The presence of such low phonon energies is doubtful, and, to explain this result, we assume that the order parameter is higher near the sample surface. In particular, it should lead [22] to a surface nucleation fields H_{\rm c3} larger than those expected for a uniform sample.

To study the superconducting sheath state in the field range H_{\rm c}<H<H_{\rm c3}, we applied an additional small ac magnetic field h(t) upon the coaxial dc field H and detected the linear and nonlinear responses. [23] The measurements have been done with our original homemade setup [24] adapted to the MPMS SQUID magnetometer. In linear experiments the ac field h(t) = h_{0}\cos\Omega t with 0< h_{0}< 0.4 Oe and \Omega/2\pi = 1455 Hz was generated by a copper solenoid inside the magnetometer and the ac susceptibility versus H was measured by the two-coil method. To study nonlinear characteristics of the sample, the ac perturbation had the form of an amplitude-modulated ac field h(t) = h_{0}(1+\alpha\cos\Omega t)\cos\omega t with two additional parameters \alpha = 0.9 and \omega/2\pi = 3.2 MHz (see for details Ref. [24], where the same technique was applied to a Nb single crystal) and the amplitude of a rectified signal at the modulation frequency A_{\Omega} was measured as a function of the dc field H.

Figure 3(a) exhibits a gradual shift of the real part \chi^{\prime} of the ac susceptibility compared with \chi_{\rm dc} calculated from dc magnetization curves. Such behavior was explained in Ref. [23] as an impact of the surface superconductivity that appears in perfect samples in a dc field parallel to the sample surface and persists in a surface region adjacent to a vacuum interface up to a field H_{\rm c3}. Near T_{\rm c}H_{\rm c3} is defined by a simple relation H_{\rm c3} = 2.38\kappa H_{\rm c}. [11] The shift between ac and dc susceptibility curves strongly depends on the amplitude and frequency of the ac field h(t) and, because of that, any interpretation and determination of a critical field value H_{\rm c} based on ac techniques should be done carefully. The nonlinear response A_{\Omega} was detected only above H_{\rm c} [Fig. 3(b)] where \chi_{\rm dc} vanishes, and hence the sample bulk was in a normal state. It corresponds to the direct observations [23] of a nonlinear nature of the response wavefront when a sinusoidal ac field is applied to a specimen in a superconducting sheath state. Variations of h_{0} cause identical behavior of A_{\Omega} in a Nb single crystal [24] where the presence of surface superconductivity was proven by different authors (see, for example, Ref. [25]). In our case, the ratio H_{\rm c3}/H_{\rm c} near T_{\rm c} is about 1.8. For a vacuum interface, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter should exceed the marginal value of \kappa = 0.71, which divides type-I and type-II superconductors. But if the order parameter increases near the interface (as it is argued above), then the ratio of the surface nucleation field H_{\rm c3} to the thermodynamic critical field can be dramatically enhanced (see Fig. 1 in Ref. [22]). Then our data could be interpreted with an assumption of type-I superconductivity. Additional experiments are needed to define the value of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter in ZrB_{12} single crystals.

In conclusion, we have proven experimentally that ZrB_{12} single crystals are conventional s-wave superconductors with enhanced surface characteristics. The latter statement can principally explain the difference in estimations of the electron-phonon coupling strength and of critical magnetic fields between the three studies performed on the same single crystals. More investigations are needed to explain all findings in this nontrivial material, in particular, the absence of the field direction effect reported in Ref. [5] (note that surface superconductivity should be strongly suppressed when the magnetic field has a component normal to the surface). We believe that zirconium dodecarboride is an interesting and fruitful compound for future experiments because of three reasons. First, due to excellent surface properties it can serve as a very suitable model material for studying specific near

  surface superconducting properties that are not yet well understood.[25] Second, our experiments show that it is an unusual marginal superconductor near the border between type-I and type-II superconductors. And last, ZrB_{12} (similar to other dodecaborides) rises above conventional materials due to its outstanding resistance to external mechanical and chemical factors. We believe that its unique material properties and comparatively simple superconducting characteristics will attract the attention of the applied physics community to the compound, which can find its place among various superconducting bulk applications where strong abrasion- and chemical-resistant properties are required.
