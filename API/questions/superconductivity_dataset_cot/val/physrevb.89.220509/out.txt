###### Abstract

We report measurements of electrical resistivity under pressure to 5.8 GPa, magnetization to 6.7 GPa, and ac susceptibility to 7.1 GPa in KFe_{2}As_{2}. The previously reported change of slope in the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}(p) at a pressure p^{*}\sim 1.8 GPa is confirmed, and T_{c}(p) is found to be nearly constant above p^{*} up to 7.1 GPa. The T-p phase diagram is very sensitive to the pressure conditions as a consequence of the anisotropic uniaxial pressure dependence of T_{c}. Across p^{*}, a change in the behavior of the upper critical field is revealed through a scaling analysis of the slope of H_{c_{2}} with the effective mass as determined from the A coefficient of the T^{2} term of the temperature-dependent resistivity. We show that this scaling provides a quantitative test for the changes of the superconducting gap structure and suggests the development of a k_{z} modulation of the superconducting gap above p^{*} as a most likely explanation.

Since the discovery of superconductivity in LaFeAs(O_{1-x}F_{x}) [1], the iron-based superconductors have been the focus of numerous experimental and theoretical studies. Taking advantage of the lessons learned from the cuprate high-temperature superconductors, the investigation of the symmetry of the superconducting state has been given priority [2]. However, unlike the cuprates, the gap structure of the iron-based superconductors is not universal and several gap symmetries have been proposed both experimentally and theoretically [3]. The stoichiometric compound KFe_{2}As_{2}, which has a superconducting transition temperature T_{c}\approx 3.5 K, is one of the cleanest examples where different gap structures appear likely [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Recently, it has been suggested that a change of pairing symmetry from d wave to s wave occurs upon applying pressure to KFe_{2}As_{2}[9]. The argument was based on the experimental observation of a change in the pressure dependence of T_{c} from negative to positive at p^{*}\approx 1.8 GPa. Following this study, ac magnetic susceptibility and de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations under pressure confirmed the change of slope in T_{c}(p) at p^{*} and supported the earlier inference that this change is not due to drastic modifications of the Fermi surface [16]. A similar change of slope of T_{c}(p) was also observed in CsFe_{2}As_{2}[17]. Although there have been theoretical predictions that the d-wave and s-wave states are very close in energy [14, 18, 19], the experimental data available so far do not provide information about the changes in the superconducting gap function at p^{*}.

In this study we significantly extend the pressure range of previous studies (\sim2.5 GPa [9, 16]) to 7.1 GPa. We confirm the observation of a change of slope in T_{c}(p) but find that the phase diagram is very sensitive to the hydrostaticity of the pressure medium in this high-pressure range. In addition, we report on the temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_{c_{2}} with the magnetic field applied along the c axis under pressure. By scaling (-d\mu_{0}H_{c_{2}}/dT|_{T_{c}})/T_{c} versus the A coefficient of the T^{2} term of the resistivity, we find a change at p^{*} which allows for a quantitative test of the modification of the superconducting gap structure. The present data are not able to test whether a change in symmetry between d wave and s wave actually takes place at 1.8 GPa. We find, however, that such a change alone would not be sufficient to account for our results. We suggest that a k_{z} modulation of the superconducting gap is involved in the slope change at p^{*}.

The Fermi surface of KFe_{2}As_{2} has been investigated experimentally by dHvA oscillation [16, 20] and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) [4, 21, 22] experiments. The Fermi surface consists of three hole cylinders at the \Gamma point [\alpha (inner), \zeta (middle), and \beta (outer) bands], and four small hole cylinders near the X point (\epsilon band). ARPES experiments down to 2 K indicate that the gap is nodeless on the \alpha and \beta bands, and nodal with octet line nodes on the \zeta (middle) band [4]. The nodes have also been detected by thermal conductivity [5, 6], penetration depth [7], and nuclear quadrupole resonance [8]. The question of whether those nodes are accidental with an s-wave state [4] or imposed by symmetry in a d-wave state [6, 9] is still under debate [10]. Other possibilities include a time-reversal symmetry breaking s+id state [11, 12, 13, 14], or an s+is state between two kinds of s\pm states which has been proposed upon Ba doping in Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}[15] in the vicinity of x\sim 0.7 where deviations in the jump in specific heat have been observed [23, 24]. In this context, the evidence for a change of gap function under pressure in KFe_{2}As_{2} illustrates the near degeneracy of these states and the possibility of studying the interplay between different superconducting states. Our results suggest that, in addition to the considered possible in-plane symmetry of the gap functions, a k_{z} modulation of the superconducting gap is involved in the slope change at p^{*}.

 In this study, several high-quality single crystals of KFe_{2}As_{2} were grown from KAs flux as detailed in Ref. [25]. For the electrical resistivity measurements, pressure was applied at room temperature using a modified Bridgman cell [26] with a 1:1 mixture of n-pentane:isopentane as a pressure medium. The ac susceptibility measurements to hydrostatic pressures as high as 7.1 GPa were carried out in a membrane-loaded diamond-anvil cell [27]. Helium was used as pressure medium. To promote hydrostaticity, pressure was increased at temperatures well above the melting curve of helium, unless stated otherwise. Further experimental details are given in the Supplemental Material [28] (see also Refs. [9, 16, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]) together with other measurements using less hydrostatic pressure media.

The superconducting phase diagram obtained from ac susceptibility and resistivity measurements is shown in Fig. 1. The previously reported change of slope in T_{c}(p) at p^{*}\approx 1.8 GPa [9, 16] is confirmed. T_{c} increases very slowly above p^{*} up to 7.1 GPa. A remarkable property of this phase diagram is its strong sensitivity on the pressure conditions. As shown by the open symbols in Fig. 1, T_{c} is increased when the pressure is applied on solid helium by comparison with liquid helium. As expected, the effect is even more dramatic with less hydrostatic media. When using a 1:1 mixture of Fluorinert FC70:FCT7, T_{c} is only slowly reduced with pressure and T_{c}\approx 3.19 K at our pressure limit of 5.8 GPa [28]. In our dc magnetization measurements using Daphne 7474, a second superconducting dome is even obtained with a maximum T_{c} as high as 3.8 K at 5.5 GPa, which is above the room temperature solidification point of this medium [28]. Such a large sensitivity to the hydrostaticity is most likely a consequence of the anisotropic uniaxial pressure dependence of T_{c} of T_{c}. In KFe_{2}As_{2}, \partial T_{c}/\partial p_{a}|_{0}\approx-1.9 K GPa^{-1} along the a axis, whereas \partial T_{c}/\partial p_{c}|_{0}\approx+2.1 K GPa^{-1} along the c axis [49]. Under hydrostatic conditions, the three axes will contribute equally to give rise to the phase diagram presented in Fig. 1. However, under nonhydrostatic conditions, as already explained in Refs. [32, 42], the pressure will be larger along the c axis and smaller in the ab plane. This results in larger values of T_{c} and a modification of the superconducting phase diagram [28].

Not only do we confirm the kink in T_{c}(p) previously reported [9, 16], but we observe that T_{c} remains roughly constant up to 7.1 GPa. A Lifshitz transition can produce such a kink in T_{c}(p). In that case, the observed increase of T_{c} just above p^{*} is consistent with the formation of a new Fermi-surface pocket [50]. However, no anomaly was observed in the Hall coefficient to support this mechanism [9], and dHvA oscillations indicate no drastic change in the Fermi surface up to \sim2.5 GPa [16].

We note that the change in slope at the characteristic pressure of 1.8 GPa could be a simple consequence of the fact that the uniaxial pressure dependencies of T_{c} are of opposite sign and large. At ambient pressure, \partial T_{c}/\partial p_{a}|_{0}\approx-1.9 K GPa^{-1} and \partial T_{c}/\partial p_{c}|_{0}\approx+2.1 K GPa^{-1} in Ref. [49] or \partial T_{c}/\partial p_{c}|_{0}\approx+1.1 K GPa^{-1} in Ref. [42]. These partial derivatives cancel each other to a considerable degree, yielding a hydrostatic pressure derivative that is negative. Any nonlinearity in T_{c}(p_{a}) or T_{c}(p_{c}) would generate a much larger relative nonlinearity in the dependence of T_{c} on hydrostatic pressure T_{c}(p). For example, were the magnitude of \partial T_{c}/\partial p_{a} to gradually decrease by a factor of \sim 3 under 3 GPa hydrostatic pressure, \partial T_{c}/\partial p_{c} remaining constant, the hydrostatic pressure dependence T_{c}(p) would be forced to pass through a minimum. We also note that, even though the modulus of elasticity is almost identical along the a and c axis, the first derivative of the modulus is over an order of magnitude smaller along the c axis [17]. This implies a larger compression along the c axis, so that the effect of pressure on T_{c} may become dominated by the p_{c} component. In such a scenario, a theoretical explanation of the uniaxial pressure dependencies of T_{c} would be the key to understanding the slope change at p^{*}.

Another possibility that may even induce the previous idea is a transition to a superconducting phase of a different symmetry. In such a case, changes in other thermodynamic quantities, such as the thermal expansion or the specific heat, are also expected. However, the combination of high pressures and low temperatures makes the experimental investigations of these quantities challenging. Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of H_{c} for the magnetic field applied along the c axis at different pressures. At ambient pressure, the upper critical field along the c axis is known to be due to the orbital limit with negligible effect due to the Pauli limit [49, 52]. With increasing pressure, as T_{c} decreases, H_{c_{2}} is also decreasing. Interestingly, above p^{*} where T_{c} remains roughly constant or increases very slowly, H_{c_{2}} continues to decrease (see inset of Fig. 2). In the following, we will relate this decrease with a commensurate decrease of the electrons' effective mass.

Figure 3 shows the low-temperature dependence of the resistivity as a function of T^{2} at various pressures (full lines). For each pressure, we performed fits with a Fermi liquid behavior \rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{2} up to 8 K (dashed lines). The pressure dependence of the A coefficient is shown in the inset. At ambient pressure, A\approx 0.02\mu\Omega cm K^{-2}, in agreement with previous reports [52, 53, 54, 55]. Under pressure, A decreases smoothly, which is consistent with the decreasing trend in effective mass observed in dHvA oscillations [16].

Figure 1: (Color online) Superconducting phase diagram for KFe_{2}As_{2} determined from our resistivity and ac susceptibility measurements [28]. For the latter, filled symbols are used when pressure was applied on liquid helium, whereas open symbols are used when pressure was applied on solid helium (at 10 K). The dashed line is a guide to the eye which does not use the two data points where the pressure was applied on solid helium. The data from Refs. [9, 16] are also shown.

  In Ref. [55], the Helfand-Werthamer theory is examined for the case of uniaxial anisotropy with an anisotropic superconducting gap. For H||c (one-band case, clean limit):

\[\frac{1}{T_{c}}\left(-\left.\frac{d\mu_{0}H_{c_{2}}^{\rm orb}}{dT}\right|_{T_{c }}\right)=\frac{8}{7\xi(3)(\Omega^{2}\mu_{c})}\frac{\phi_{0}2\pi{k_{B}}^{2}}{{ \hbar^{2}{v_{0}}}^{2}}.\] (1)

The function \Omega({\bf k_{F}}) which determines the {\bf k_{F}} dependence of the superconducting gap \Delta=\Psi({\bf r},T)\Omega({\bf k_{F}}) is normalized so that \langle\Omega^{2}\rangle=1. The averages over the Fermi surface are shown as \langle\cdot\cdot\cdot\rangle.

\[\mu_{c}=\frac{{{v_{\rm{v}}}^{2}+{v_{\rm{y}}}^{2}}}{{{v_{0}}}^{2}}\quad\mbox{ and}\quad{v_{0}}^{3}=\frac{2{E_{F}}^{2}}{{\pi}^{2}{\hbar}^{3}N(0)},\]

where N(0) is the total DOS at the Fermi level E_{F} per spin. Assuming that the A coefficient of the T^{2} term of the resistivity, when resistivity is measured along x, obeys A\propto n/\langle{v_{\rm{x}}}^{-}\rangle, the A coefficient in the tetragonal case will reflect the dependence on 1/({{v_{0}}}^{2}\langle\mu_{c}\rangle):

\[\frac{1}{T_{c}}\left(-\left.\frac{d\mu_{0}H_{c_{2}}^{\rm orb}}{dT}\right|_{T_{c }}\right)\propto\frac{\langle\mu_{c}\rangle}{\langle\Omega^{2}\mu_{c}\rangle} \frac{A}{n},\] (2)

where the carrier density n can be estimated from Hall measurements. A more detailed expression for A can be found in various publications [56, 57] and would lead to a more complicated expression than that given in Eq. (2). A refinement to the case of several bands would certainly be of interest. In the present form, Eq. (2) shows a proportionality between the slope of H_{c_{2}} at T_{c} and the A coefficient. This result is known for heavy fermions, both quantities being proportional to the square of the effective mass [58, 59].

Figure 4 shows the plot of (-d\mu_{0}H_{c_{2}}/dT|_{T_{c}})/T_{c} versus A. All measured points fall onto two straight lines of different slope corresponding to p<p* and p>p*. It is remarkable that both lines go through the origin as expected from the proportionality relation in Eq. (2). Equation (2) indicates that a change of slope when plotting (-d\mu_{0}H_{c_{2}}^{\rm orb}/dT|_{T_{c}})/T_{c} versus A implies a change in either n, \Omega, or \mu_{c}. In KFe_{2}As_{2}, the carrier density does not change significantly with pressure as inferred from Hall resistivity measurements [9] and from the smooth pressure variation of the A coefficient. Therefore, the observed change of slope is more likely due to a change in \langle\Omega^{2}\mu_{c}\rangle. We note that a change of the superconducting gap symmetry is not the only possible explanation, since a change of the Fermi surface will also modify the value of \langle\Omega^{2}\mu_{c}\rangle. However, dHvA oscillations experiments indicate that the global structure of the Fermi surface hardly changes up to p\sim 2.5 GPa. We mention that \langle\mu_{c}\rangle/\langle\Omega^{2}\mu_{c}\rangle=1 for any \Omega that does not depend on k_{c}. Therefore, a simple change between s wave and d wave would

The dashed lines show fits of the resistivity to a Fermi liquid behavior \rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{2}. The pressure dependence of the A coefficient is shown in the inset. The dashed line represents A(0)/(1+\beta p)^{2} where \beta=0.16(1) GPa^{-1}.

Figure 2: (Color online) Temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_{c_{2}} at different pressures. The data were determined using a resistive transition offset criteria (\rho=0, see Ref. [25]). We note that, unlike the use of the transition midpoint criteria, the chosen offset criteria agree more closely with ambient pressure specific heat measurements [51]. The inset shows the pressure dependence of H_{c_{2}} at 0.5 K.

  not be able to explain the change of slope of nearly a factor of two observed in Fig. 4.

On the other hand, the appearance of a k_{z} modulation of the superconducting gap at p^{*} can explain an increase of nearly a factor two in \langle\mu_{c}\rangle/(\Omega^{2}\mu_{c}). Let us assume a superconducting gap with a modulation along k_{z}[55, 60, 61]:

\[\Delta=\Delta_{0}[1+\eta\cos(k_{z}c^{*})],\] (3)

where c^{*}=\hbar v_{0}/(2E_{F}) is the length scale [55]. Let us also assume a prolate ellipsoidal Fermi surface (\epsilon=0.1 in the notations of Ref. [55]). We find that \langle\mu_{c}\rangle/(\Omega^{2}\mu_{c}) changes from 1 to \sim1.9 if \eta changes from 0 to -0.8. Therefore, if we assume that the Fermi surface does not change at p^{*}, the appearance of a k_{z} modulation of the superconducting gap at p^{*} can be a possible explanation of our experimental observations. A k_{z} dependence of the superconducting gap has been observed by ARPES in Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2}[61], in agreement with a theoretical prediction for the pairing strength [62]. The pairing between the layers is predominantly responsible for the gap dispersion with k_{z}. In contrast, in Ba_{0.1}K_{0.3}Fe_{2}As_{2}, the superconducting gap size on all the \Gamma-centered hole Fermi surfaces does not vary much along k_{z}[63]. This is consistent with the near two-dimensionality of KFe_{2}As_{2} by comparison with the other members of the 122 family [22, 64, 65, 66, 67]. It is possible that, by applying pressure on KFe_{2}As_{2}, the pairing between the layers induces a k_{z} modulation of the superconducting gap. This is also consistent with dHvA oscillations measurements showing that three-dimensionality increases with pressure [16].

In conclusion we have shown that there is very likely a change in the k_{z} modulation of the SC gap at p^{*}\sim 1.8 GPa. We base this conclusion on a change in the scaling of (-d\mu_{0}H_{cz}/dT|_{T})/T_{c} with the A coefficient of the T^{2} term of the resistivity. We have shown that this indicates either a change of the Fermi surface, of the carrier density, and/or of the superconducting gap symmetry. In addition, we significantly extended the pressure temperature phase diagram from \sim2.5 to 7.1 GPa. For p>2.5 GPa we found that T_{c} increases only slightly up to 7.1 GPa. By using various pressure cells and several different pressure-transmitting media, we have demonstrated the extreme sensitivity of KFe_{2}As_{2} to nonhydrostaticity [28] and propose that it is due to the anisotropic dependence of T_{c} on strain.

###### Abstract

We report measurements of electrical resistivity under pressure to 5.8 GPa, magnetization to 6.7 GPa, and ac susceptibility to 7.1 GPa in KFe_{2}As_{2}. The previously reported change of slope in the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}(p) at a pressure p^{*}\sim 1.8 GPa is confirmed, and T_{c}(p) is found to be nearly constant above p^{*} up to 7.1 GPa. The T-p phase diagram is very sensitive to the pressure conditions as a consequence of the anisotropic uniaxial pressure dependence of T_{c}. Across p^{*}, a change in the behavior of the upper critical field is revealed through a scaling analysis of the slope of H_{c_{2}} with the effective mass as determined from the A coefficient of the T^{2} term of the temperature-dependent resistivity. We show that this scaling provides a quantitative test for the changes of the superconducting gap structure and suggests the development of a k_{z} modulation of the superconducting gap above p^{*} as a most likely explanation.

Since the discovery of superconductivity in LaFeAs(O_{1-x}F_{x}) [1], the iron-based superconductors have been the focus of numerous experimental and theoretical studies. Taking advantage of the lessons learned from the cuprate high-temperature superconductors, the investigation of the symmetry of the superconducting state has been given priority [2]. However, unlike the cuprates, the gap structure of the iron-based superconductors is not universal and several gap symmetries have been proposed both experimentally and theoretically [3]. The stoichiometric compound KFe_{2}As_{2}, which has a superconducting transition temperature T_{c}\approx 3.5 K, is one of the cleanest examples where different gap structures appear likely [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Recently, it has been suggested that a change of pairing symmetry from d wave to s wave occurs upon applying pressure to KFe_{2}As_{2}[9]. The argument was based on the experimental observation of a change in the pressure dependence of T_{c} from negative to positive at p^{*}\approx 1.8 GPa. Following this study, ac magnetic susceptibility and de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations under pressure confirmed the change of slope in T_{c}(p) at p^{*} and supported the earlier inference that this change is not due to drastic modifications of the Fermi surface [16]. A similar change of slope of T_{c}(p) was also observed in CsFe_{2}As_{2}[17]. Although there have been theoretical predictions that the d-wave and s-wave states are very close in energy [14, 18, 19], the experimental data available so far do not provide information about the changes in the superconducting gap function at p^{*}.

In this study we significantly extend the pressure range of previous studies (\sim2.5 GPa [9, 16]) to 7.1 GPa. We confirm the observation of a change of slope in T_{c}(p) but find that the phase diagram is very sensitive to the hydrostaticity of the pressure medium in this high-pressure range. In addition, we report on the temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_{c_{2}} with the magnetic field applied along the c axis under pressure. By scaling (-d\mu_{0}H_{c_{2}}/dT|_{T_{c}})/T_{c} versus the A coefficient of the T^{2} term of the resistivity, we find a change at p^{*} which allows for a quantitative test of the modification of the superconducting gap structure. The present data are not able to test whether a change in symmetry between d wave and s wave actually takes place at 1.8 GPa. We find, however, that such a change alone would not be sufficient to account for our results. We suggest that a k_{z} modulation of the superconducting gap is involved in the slope change at p^{*}.

The Fermi surface of KFe_{2}As_{2} has been investigated experimentally by dHvA oscillation [16, 20] and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) [4, 21, 22] experiments. The Fermi surface consists of three hole cylinders at the \Gamma point [\alpha (inner), \zeta (middle), and \beta (outer) bands], and four small hole cylinders near the X point (\epsilon band). ARPES experiments down to 2 K indicate that the gap is nodeless on the \alpha and \beta bands, and nodal with octet line nodes on the \zeta (middle) band [4]. The nodes have also been detected by thermal conductivity [5, 6], penetration depth [7], and nuclear quadrupole resonance [8]. The question of whether those nodes are accidental with an s-wave state [4] or imposed by symmetry in a d-wave state [6, 9] is still under debate [10]. Other possibilities include a time-reversal symmetry breaking s+id state [11, 12, 13, 14], or an s+is state between two kinds of s\pm states which has been proposed upon Ba doping in Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}[15] in the vicinity of x\sim 0.7 where deviations in the jump in specific heat have been observed [23, 24]. In this context, the evidence for a change of gap function under pressure in KFe_{2}As_{2} illustrates the near degeneracy of these states and the possibility of studying the interplay between different superconducting states. Our results suggest that, in addition to the considered possible in-plane symmetry of the gap functions, a k_{z} modulation of the superconducting gap is involved in the slope change at p^{*}.

 In this study, several high-quality single crystals of KFe_{2}As_{2} were grown from KAs flux as detailed in Ref. [25]. For the electrical resistivity measurements, pressure was applied at room temperature using a modified Bridgman cell [26] with a 1:1 mixture of n-pentane:isopentane as a pressure medium. The ac susceptibility measurements to hydrostatic pressures as high as 7.1 GPa were carried out in a membrane-loaded diamond-anvil cell [27]. Helium was used as pressure medium. To promote hydrostaticity, pressure was increased at temperatures well above the melting curve of helium, unless stated otherwise. Further experimental details are given in the Supplemental Material [28] (see also Refs. [9, 16, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]) together with other measurements using less hydrostatic pressure media.

The superconducting phase diagram obtained from ac susceptibility and resistivity measurements is shown in Fig. 1. The previously reported change of slope in T_{c}(p) at p^{*}\approx 1.8 GPa [9, 16] is confirmed. T_{c} increases very slowly above p^{*} up to 7.1 GPa. A remarkable property of this phase diagram is its strong sensitivity on the pressure conditions. As shown by the open symbols in Fig. 1, T_{c} is increased when the pressure is applied on solid helium by comparison with liquid helium. As expected, the effect is even more dramatic with less hydrostatic media. When using a 1:1 mixture of Fluorinert FC70:FCT7, T_{c} is only slowly reduced with pressure and T_{c}\approx 3.19 K at our pressure limit of 5.8 GPa [28]. In our dc magnetization measurements using Daphne 7474, a second superconducting dome is even obtained with a maximum T_{c} as high as 3.8 K at 5.5 GPa, which is above the room temperature solidification point of this medium [28]. Such a large sensitivity to the hydrostaticity is most likely a consequence of the anisotropic uniaxial pressure dependence of T_{c} of T_{c}. In KFe_{2}As_{2}, \partial T_{c}/\partial p_{a}|_{0}\approx-1.9 K GPa^{-1} along the a axis, whereas \partial T_{c}/\partial p_{c}|_{0}\approx+2.1 K GPa^{-1} along the c axis [49]. Under hydrostatic conditions, the three axes will contribute equally to give rise to the phase diagram presented in Fig. 1. However, under nonhydrostatic conditions, as already explained in Refs. [32, 42], the pressure will be larger along the c axis and smaller in the ab plane. This results in larger values of T_{c} and a modification of the superconducting phase diagram [28].

Not only do we confirm the kink in T_{c}(p) previously reported [9, 16], but we observe that T_{c} remains roughly constant up to 7.1 GPa. A Lifshitz transition can produce such a kink in T_{c}(p). In that case, the observed increase of T_{c} just above p^{*} is consistent with the formation of a new Fermi-surface pocket [50]. However, no anomaly was observed in the Hall coefficient to support this mechanism [9], and dHvA oscillations indicate no drastic change in the Fermi surface up to \sim2.5 GPa [16].

We note that the change in slope at the characteristic pressure of 1.8 GPa could be a simple consequence of the fact that the uniaxial pressure dependencies of T_{c} are of opposite sign and large. At ambient pressure, \partial T_{c}/\partial p_{a}|_{0}\approx-1.9 K GPa^{-1} and \partial T_{c}/\partial p_{c}|_{0}\approx+2.1 K GPa^{-1} in Ref. [49] or \partial T_{c}/\partial p_{c}|_{0}\approx+1.1 K GPa^{-1} in Ref. [42]. These partial derivatives cancel each other to a considerable degree, yielding a hydrostatic pressure derivative that is negative. Any nonlinearity in T_{c}(p_{a}) or T_{c}(p_{c}) would generate a much larger relative nonlinearity in the dependence of T_{c} on hydrostatic pressure T_{c}(p). For example, were the magnitude of \partial T_{c}/\partial p_{a} to gradually decrease by a factor of \sim 3 under 3 GPa hydrostatic pressure, \partial T_{c}/\partial p_{c} remaining constant, the hydrostatic pressure dependence T_{c}(p) would be forced to pass through a minimum. We also note that, even though the modulus of elasticity is almost identical along the a and c axis, the first derivative of the modulus is over an order of magnitude smaller along the c axis [17]. This implies a larger compression along the c axis, so that the effect of pressure on T_{c} may become dominated by the p_{c} component. In such a scenario, a theoretical explanation of the uniaxial pressure dependencies of T_{c} would be the key to understanding the slope change at p^{*}.

Another possibility that may even induce the previous idea is a transition to a superconducting phase of a different symmetry. In such a case, changes in other thermodynamic quantities, such as the thermal expansion or the specific heat, are also expected. However, the combination of high pressures and low temperatures makes the experimental investigations of these quantities challenging. Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of H_{c} for the magnetic field applied along the c axis at different pressures. At ambient pressure, the upper critical field along the c axis is known to be due to the orbital limit with negligible effect due to the Pauli limit [49, 52]. With increasing pressure, as T_{c} decreases, H_{c_{2}} is also decreasing. Interestingly, above p^{*} where T_{c} remains roughly constant or increases very slowly, H_{c_{2}} continues to decrease (see inset of Fig. 2). In the following, we will relate this decrease with a commensurate decrease of the electrons' effective mass.

Figure 3 shows the low-temperature dependence of the resistivity as a function of T^{2} at various pressures (full lines). For each pressure, we performed fits with a Fermi liquid behavior \rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{2} up to 8 K (dashed lines). The pressure dependence of the A coefficient is shown in the inset. At ambient pressure, A\approx 0.02\mu\Omega cm K^{-2}, in agreement with previous reports [52, 53, 54, 55]. Under pressure, A decreases smoothly, which is consistent with the decreasing trend in effective mass observed in dHvA oscillations [16].

Figure 1: (Color online) Superconducting phase diagram for KFe_{2}As_{2} determined from our resistivity and ac susceptibility measurements [28]. For the latter, filled symbols are used when pressure was applied on liquid helium, whereas open symbols are used when pressure was applied on solid helium (at 10 K). The dashed line is a guide to the eye which does not use the two data points where the pressure was applied on solid helium. The data from Refs. [9, 16] are also shown.

  In Ref. [55], the Helfand-Werthamer theory is examined for the case of uniaxial anisotropy with an anisotropic superconducting gap. For H||c (one-band case, clean limit):

\[\frac{1}{T_{c}}\left(-\left.\frac{d\mu_{0}H_{c_{2}}^{\rm orb}}{dT}\right|_{T_{c }}\right)=\frac{8}{7\xi(3)(\Omega^{2}\mu_{c})}\frac{\phi_{0}2\pi{k_{B}}^{2}}{{ \hbar^{2}{v_{0}}}^{2}}.\] (1)

The function \Omega({\bf k_{F}}) which determines the {\bf k_{F}} dependence of the superconducting gap \Delta=\Psi({\bf r},T)\Omega({\bf k_{F}}) is normalized so that \langle\Omega^{2}\rangle=1. The averages over the Fermi surface are shown as \langle\cdot\cdot\cdot\rangle.

\[\mu_{c}=\frac{{{v_{\rm{v}}}^{2}+{v_{\rm{y}}}^{2}}}{{{v_{0}}}^{2}}\quad\mbox{ and}\quad{v_{0}}^{3}=\frac{2{E_{F}}^{2}}{{\pi}^{2}{\hbar}^{3}N(0)},\]

where N(0) is the total DOS at the Fermi level E_{F} per spin. Assuming that the A coefficient of the T^{2} term of the resistivity, when resistivity is measured along x, obeys A\propto n/\langle{v_{\rm{x}}}^{-}\rangle, the A coefficient in the tetragonal case will reflect the dependence on 1/({{v_{0}}}^{2}\langle\mu_{c}\rangle):

\[\frac{1}{T_{c}}\left(-\left.\frac{d\mu_{0}H_{c_{2}}^{\rm orb}}{dT}\right|_{T_{c }}\right)\propto\frac{\langle\mu_{c}\rangle}{\langle\Omega^{2}\mu_{c}\rangle} \frac{A}{n},\] (2)

where the carrier density n can be estimated from Hall measurements. A more detailed expression for A can be found in various publications [56, 57] and would lead to a more complicated expression than that given in Eq. (2). A refinement to the case of several bands would certainly be of interest. In the present form, Eq. (2) shows a proportionality between the slope of H_{c_{2}} at T_{c} and the A coefficient. This result is known for heavy fermions, both quantities being proportional to the square of the effective mass [58, 59].

Figure 4 shows the plot of (-d\mu_{0}H_{c_{2}}/dT|_{T_{c}})/T_{c} versus A. All measured points fall onto two straight lines of different slope corresponding to p<p* and p>p*. It is remarkable that both lines go through the origin as expected from the proportionality relation in Eq. (2). Equation (2) indicates that a change of slope when plotting (-d\mu_{0}H_{c_{2}}^{\rm orb}/dT|_{T_{c}})/T_{c} versus A implies a change in either n, \Omega, or \mu_{c}. In KFe_{2}As_{2}, the carrier density does not change significantly with pressure as inferred from Hall resistivity measurements [9] and from the smooth pressure variation of the A coefficient. Therefore, the observed change of slope is more likely due to a change in \langle\Omega^{2}\mu_{c}\rangle. We note that a change of the superconducting gap symmetry is not the only possible explanation, since a change of the Fermi surface will also modify the value of \langle\Omega^{2}\mu_{c}\rangle. However, dHvA oscillations experiments indicate that the global structure of the Fermi surface hardly changes up to p\sim 2.5 GPa. We mention that \langle\mu_{c}\rangle/\langle\Omega^{2}\mu_{c}\rangle=1 for any \Omega that does not depend on k_{c}. Therefore, a simple change between s wave and d wave would

The dashed lines show fits of the resistivity to a Fermi liquid behavior \rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{2}. The pressure dependence of the A coefficient is shown in the inset. The dashed line represents A(0)/(1+\beta p)^{2} where \beta=0.16(1) GPa^{-1}.

Figure 2: (Color online) Temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_{c_{2}} at different pressures. The data were determined using a resistive transition offset criteria (\rho=0, see Ref. [25]). We note that, unlike the use of the transition midpoint criteria, the chosen offset criteria agree more closely with ambient pressure specific heat measurements [51]. The inset shows the pressure dependence of H_{c_{2}} at 0.5 K.

  not be able to explain the change of slope of nearly a factor of two observed in Fig. 4.

On the other hand, the appearance of a k_{z} modulation of the superconducting gap at p^{*} can explain an increase of nearly a factor two in \langle\mu_{c}\rangle/(\Omega^{2}\mu_{c}). Let us assume a superconducting gap with a modulation along k_{z}[55, 60, 61]:

\[\Delta=\Delta_{0}[1+\eta\cos(k_{z}c^{*})],\] (3)

where c^{*}=\hbar v_{0}/(2E_{F}) is the length scale [55]. Let us also assume a prolate ellipsoidal Fermi surface (\epsilon=0.1 in the notations of Ref. [55]). We find that \langle\mu_{c}\rangle/(\Omega^{2}\mu_{c}) changes from 1 to \sim1.9 if \eta changes from 0 to -0.8. Therefore, if we assume that the Fermi surface does not change at p^{*}, the appearance of a k_{z} modulation of the superconducting gap at p^{*} can be a possible explanation of our experimental observations. A k_{z} dependence of the superconducting gap has been observed by ARPES in Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2}[61], in agreement with a theoretical prediction for the pairing strength [62]. The pairing between the layers is predominantly responsible for the gap dispersion with k_{z}. In contrast, in Ba_{0.1}K_{0.3}Fe_{2}As_{2}, the superconducting gap size on all the \Gamma-centered hole Fermi surfaces does not vary much along k_{z}[63]. This is consistent with the near two-dimensionality of KFe_{2}As_{2} by comparison with the other members of the 122 family [22, 64, 65, 66, 67]. It is possible that, by applying pressure on KFe_{2}As_{2}, the pairing between the layers induces a k_{z} modulation of the superconducting gap. This is also consistent with dHvA oscillations measurements showing that three-dimensionality increases with pressure [16].

In conclusion we have shown that there is very likely a change in the k_{z} modulation of the SC gap at p^{*}\sim 1.8 GPa. We base this conclusion on a change in the scaling of (-d\mu_{0}H_{cz}/dT|_{T})/T_{c} with the A coefficient of the T^{2} term of the resistivity. We have shown that this indicates either a change of the Fermi surface, of the carrier density, and/or of the superconducting gap symmetry. In addition, we significantly extended the pressure temperature phase diagram from \sim2.5 to 7.1 GPa. For p>2.5 GPa we found that T_{c} increases only slightly up to 7.1 GPa. By using various pressure cells and several different pressure-transmitting media, we have demonstrated the extreme sensitivity of KFe_{2}As_{2} to nonhydrostaticity [28] and propose that it is due to the anisotropic dependence of T_{c} on strain.
