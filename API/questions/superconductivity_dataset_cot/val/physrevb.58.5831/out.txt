###### Abstract

Both Ni- and Zn-substitution effects on superconducting and magnetic properties of La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 were studied by measuring the magnetic susceptibility _kh_ and the electronic specific heat _C_d at T <= _T_c_ . In Ni-substituted samples with x >= 0.14, the local nature of the spin correlation among 3d spins remains almost unchanged even on Ni sites at low Ni concentrations, where Ni atoms are substituted as Ni2+ ions. On the other hand, in Zn-substituted samples the 3_d_-spin correlation is seriously disturbed on host Cu sites around each Zn site. The depression of _T_c and the residual g value at T <= _T_c_ indicate that the suppression of the superconductivity in Zn-substituted samples is much stronger than that in Ni3+-substituted ones. The suppression of the superconductivity in the Ni3+-substituted samples can be understood in the context of a potential scattering of the Cooper pairs in a _d_-wave superconductor. On the other hand, the strong suppression of the superconductivity in the Zn-substituted samples will occur through the local disturbance of the 3_d_-spin correlation on host Cu sites around each Zn ion.

## I Introduction

In typical high-_T_c cuprates such as YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (YBCO) and La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 (LSCO), partial substitution of nonmagnetic ions such as Zn2+ and Al3+ for Cu leads to stronger suppression of the superconductivity than substitution of nominally magnetic Ni ions, which is in sharp contrast with the conventional superconductors.1-5 It has been found in NMR experiments that partial substitution of Zn or Al induces localized magnetic moments on host Cu sites neighboring Zn or Al.6-8 Therefore, the induced local-magnetic moments were invoked to suggest magnetic pair breaking as possible origins of the strong suppression of _T_c in Zn- or Al-substituted LSCO and YBCO samples.1,3,7 However, Ishida _et al._ have performed 27Al NMR studies on Al-substituted LSCO, whose _T_c is suppressed to almost the same extent as that in Zn-substituted LSCO, and found that the magnetic pair breaking due to the local magnetic moments induced by the substitution of nonmagnetic ions is too weak to explain the rapid suppression of _T_c .8 It has been reported for both LSCO and YBCO systems that the Zn substitution causes a large residual density of states at _E_F at T  _t_c , _N_res , in addition to the rapid suppression of _T_c , _T_c . The _N_res vs _T_c relation can be qualitatively explained on the basis of a _d_-wave superconductor by assuming that nonmagnetic Zn ions act as strong potential scatterers in the unitarity limit.9-13 However, the _N_res vs _D_T_c relation obtained for LSCO samples with x <= 0.18 obviously deviates from the theoretical prediction.10

In comparison with nonmagnetic ions such as Zn2+ and Al3+, nominally magnetic Ni ions lead to a moderate effect not only on the superconductivity but also on the local magnetism at host Cu sites neighboring Ni in the YBCO system.2,12-15 It was demonstrated by NMR studies on the YBCO system that the spin-lattice relaxation time 63T1 of 63Cu is only slightly modified even on planar Cu sites around Ni ions, whereas 63T1 is largely modified on planar Cu sites around Zn ions on account of a local disturbance of spin correlation among Cu 3d spins.12-14 Mendels _et al._ measured the Curie term on Ni-substituted YBCO samples, and found that the Curie constant corresponds to S = 1/2 rather than S = 1, though usually S = 1 is expected for Ni2+ ions.15 They explained the results as follows: an isolated 3d spin in the 3d3_2-_r_2 orbital of Ni2+, whose magnetic channels to neighboring host Cu 3d2-_r_2 spins are very weak, will contribute to the Curie term corresponding to S = 1/2, while a spin in the Ni 3d2-_r_2 orbital can couple antiferromagnetically to neighboring Cu 3d2-_r_2 spins; that is, the magnetic channel between 3d2-_r_2 spins survives at Ni sites. The survival of the magnetic channels will preserve the local nature of the 3d2-_r_2-spin correlation on host Cu sites around Ni sites. Recently the superconductivity of cuprates was found to be of a _d_-wave type, and antiferromagnetic interaction within the CuO2 plane has received more attention than ever as a candidate for the origin of the superconductivity.10,16-20 Therefore, the preservation of the local nature of the 3d2-_r_2-spin correlation has become of interest to explain the milder pair-breaking effect of Ni than that of Zn in the YBCO system.15 It has also been reported for the LSCO system that the superconductivity is less suppressed in Ni-substituted samples than in Zn-substituted ones.1,3,5 To understand the reason why the substitution effects on the superconductivity are rather different between nominally magnetic Ni and nonmagnetic Zn, we should clarify their substitution effects on the magnetic properties in the LSCO system as well as the YBCO system. However, the Ni-substitution effect on magnetic properties has not been systematically studied for the LSCO system yet.

In the present study, we investigate both Ni- and Zn-substitution effects on magnetic properties and superconductivity of LSCO by measuring the magnetic susceptibility _kh_ and the electronic specific heat _C_d at T <= _T_c . It was found in  Ni-substituted LSCO with x >= 0.14 that the spin correlation among 3_d_x_2-,y2 spins remains unchanged even on Ni sites below the critical Ni concentration y0, where Ni atoms are substituted as trivalent Ni3+ ions. On the other hand, in Zn-substituted samples the 3_d_x_2-,y2-spin correlation is seriously disturbed on host Cu sites around each Zn site because the magnetic channels between 3_d_x_2-,y2 spins are disrupted at nonmagnetic Zn ions. It was also found that the depression of _T_c and the residual density of states at E_{F} at T <= _T_c are much smaller in Ni3+-substituted samples than in Zn-substituted ones. We discuss the difference between Ni- and Zn-substitution effects on the superconductivity in terms of the local disturbance of the 3_d_x_2-,y2-spin correlation.

## II Experiments

A master batch of high-purity La2-,Sr2Cu1-,M,O4 (_M_ = Ni, Zn) samples was prepared using La2O3, SrCO3, CuO, NiO, and ZnO powders of high purity (99.99-99.999 %) at 1050-1150 degC in an oxygen atmosphere with one intermediate grinding, followed by annealing in an oxygen atmosphere at 600 degC for 24 h. Each sample was fully characterized by x-ray diffraction and confirmed to be single phase.

Magnetic susceptibility was measured by using a Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer. The magnetic susceptibility in the normal state was measured under a magnetic field of 10 kOe in a _T_-range below ~600 K in both courses of heating and cooling. There was no degradation of samples due to oxygen deficiency, at least in the _T_-range examined. Measurements of the superconducting diamagnetism were carried out under a field of 15 Oe. The specific-heat capacity was measured by a conventional adiabatic heat pulse method within a T2 range from 4 K2 to 50 K2. Details of the measurements have been reported elsewhere.9,10

## III Results and Discussion

### Substitution effect on the magnetic susceptibility

In Figs. 1 and 2, the magnetic susceptibility _kh_ is shown for the normal state of La2-,Sr2Cu1-,M,O4 (_M_ = Ni, Zn) with x = 0.2. The _kh_ -_T_ curve of La2-,Sr2Cu1-,M,_Y_O4 exhibits a broad peak at temperature _T_max as well as that of La2-,Sr2CuO4 (LSCO).21-29 In Zn-substituted samples, the position of the broad peak weakly depends on Zn concentration y though the broad peak is obscured by the appearance of the Curie term at Zn concentrations of more than 1%. On the other hand, in Ni-substituted samples the position of the broad peak of the _kh_ -_T_ curve largely shifts to higher temperatures with increase in Ni concentration y at y < 0.03, and the shift tends to be saturated at y >= 0.03 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, in Ni-substituted samples with y < 0.03, no evident Curie term was observed at low temperatures though Ni ions are nominally magnetic.

In our previous study, the magnetic susceptibility of Zn-substituted LSCO samples was analyzed by assuming that it contains a _T_-dependent spin component, _kh_'(_T_), and a _T_-independent one, _kh_0, in addition to the Curie component _C_/_T_, i.e.,

\[\chi = \chi^{\prime}(T) + \chi^{0} + C/T,\]

where component _kh_'(_T_) is characterized by a broad peak at _T_max.22 Both the characteristic temperature, _T_max, and the size of _kh_'(_T_) largely depend on the Sr concentration, namely, the hole concentration p within the CuO2 plane, but the normalized _kh_'(_T_) vs T curve, _kh_'(_T_/_T_max)/_kh_'(_T_max) vs _T_/_T_max, follows a universal curve, F, which is the same universal curve as that identified for LSCO samples, regardless of p.22,230 Universal curve F can be understood in terms of an S = 1/2 square-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet at high temperatures (_T_ >= 0.7_T_max).22,24,30 In the present study, we fitted the data of Ni-substituted samples to Eq. (1) using the same universal curve F. As seen in Fig. 2, the _kh_ -_T_ curves of Ni-substituted samples can be reproduced very well.

In Figs. 3 and 4, the Curie constant and temperature _T_max determined in the above analyses are shown for La2-,Sr2Cu1-,Ni2O4 (0.14 <= x <= 0.22) as a function of y. As seen in Fig. 3, it was confirmed that there exists no additional Curie term in Ni-substituted samples up to a certain value, y0, while the Curie term appears at y > y0. The details of the Curie term will be mentioned later. It should be noticed in Fig. 4 that _T_max rapidly increases with increasing y up to the value y0, while the increase of _T_max tends to be saturated at

  y\!>\!y_{0} . The characteristic Ni-concentration y_{0} increases with increasing x (the inset of Fig. 4). Since T_{\rm max} was found to increase with a decrease in the hole concentration p(\!=\!x) in unsubstituted LSCO samples (Fig. 5), [22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29] the increase of T_{\rm max} with Ni concentration suggests that the substitution of Ni for Cu may reduce the hole concentration p. A possible origin of the hole reduction is that Ni atoms will be substituted as trivalent Ni^{3+} ions, because the substitution of a Ni^{3+} ion for a Cu^{2+} consumes a hole within the CuO_{2} plane. Such a possibility has already been pointed out by Bhat _et al._ on the basis of different T_{c}\!-\!x curves between Ni-free and Ni-substituted LSCO systems.[31] If Ni atoms are substituted as trivalent ions in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} the hole concentration p should be given by p\!=\!x\!-\!y, instead of p\!=\!x. In fact, when T_{\rm max} of La_{1.8}Sr_{0.2}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} (y\!<\!y_{0}) is plotted as a function of p\!=\!0.2\!-\!y , it agrees very well with the data of Ni-free La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} samples with x\!=\!0.2\!-\!y , as seen in Fig. 5. The good agreement supports the possibility that all Ni atoms will be substituted as trivalent Ni^{3+} ions at y\leq\!y_{0} . In this context, the saturation of T_{\rm max} at y\!>\!y_{0} means that p will be fixed at p\!=\!x\!-\!y_{0} ; i.e., some Ni ions, y_{0} , become trivalent while the rest of them, y\!-\!y_{0} , are divalent.

Studies of the electronic specific heat C_{\rm d} on nonsuperconducting La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}_{M}O_{4} (M\!=\!Ni, Zn) samples also support the possibility that Ni will be substituted as Ni^{3+} at y\!<\!y_{0} . In the inset of Fig. 5, the coefficient of the T-linear term of C_{\rm d}, \gamma_{N} , is shown for nonsuperconducting La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}_{M}O_{4} (M\!=\!Ni, Zn) as a function of x. The \gamma_{N} value is evidently smaller in Ni-substituted samples than in Zn-substituted ones, as has already reported by Hiroi _et al.[32]_ Here, to take into account the hole consumption effect of Ni^{3+}, we replot the \gamma_{N} value of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} against p\!=\!x\!-\!y_{0} regarding the horizontal axis x as p in the inset of Fig. 5. In this plot, the \gamma_{N} values of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} (p\!=\!x\!-\!y_{0}) are in agreement with those of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Zn_{y}O_{4} (p\!=\!x), as expected.

Now we refocus on the result showing that the Ni substitution induces no additional Curie term in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} (y\!<\!y_{0}) samples. Figure 6 shows the \chi\!-\!T curve for La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} (y\!<\!y_{0}), whose hole concentration p was kept at 0.16 regardless of y, that is, x was always chosen to hold p(\!=\!x\!-\!y)\!=\!0.16 for any given y(\!<\!y_{0}). In Fig. 6, the reduced temperature T/T_{\rm max} is used to correct a small difference of p among different samples, \Delta p, which was inadvertently introduced; the present \Delta p(\!\simeq\!0.002) corresponds to the shift of \pm\!10 K in T_{\rm max} . Each set of data is shifted as a whole, at most, by \sim5% along the vertical axis in order to remove the offset value of \chi, which was due to accidental errors characteristic of the apparatus. It should be noticed in Fig. 6 that the \chi\!-\!T curves for La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} (y\!<\!y_{0}) agree well with that for the Ni-free sample over a wide temperature range without any correction of the Curie term; that is, no Curie term appears in Ni-substituted samples with y\!<\!y_{0} . This indicates that there exist no isolated spins on Ni sites in  La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} (y<y_{0}) samples and the local nature of spin correlation among 3_d_x_2-,y2 spins is not seriously changed on Cu sites around Ni. Such a Ni^{3+}-substitution effect on the 3_d_x_2-,y2-spin correlation is in sharp contrast to the Zn-substitution effect; in Zn-substituted samples the 3_d_-spin correlation is seriously disturbed on Cu site around each Zn because the magnetic channel among 3_d_x_2-,y2 spins is disrupted at nonmagnetic Zn sites, and a resultant Curie term appears.[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]

It is noteworthy that the absence of the Curie term in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} (y<y_{0}) samples can not be understood in terms of divalent Ni^{2+} ions. The reason is as follows. There are two different possible 3d configurations for divalent Ni^{2+} ions in the present case: magnetic configuration d_{x_2-,y2}[2]d_{3_2}2-,y2[1] and nonmagnetic one d_{x_2-,y2}[2]d_{3_2}2-,y2[2]d_{3_2}2-,y2[3]d  value.[10] The decrease of T_{c} is slower in Ni-substituted samples than in Zn-substituted ones, as reported by Tararscon _et al._ and Xiao _et al._[1, 3]_

In Fig. 8, typical results of the specific heat at T{<}T_{c} are shown for La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}M_{y}O_{4} (M{=}Ni, Zn) with p = 0.16 and 0.22 with C/T versus T^{2} plot. The low-temperature specific heat of unsubstituted LSCO samples fits to the sum of an electronic T^{2} term and a phonon T^{3} term at T{\ll}T_{c}.[9, 10] The quadratic behavior of the electronic specific heat C_{\rm d} is peculiar to superconductors with line nodes in the gap structure, such as d-wave and extremely anisotropic s-wave superconductors.[9, 10, 36, 37] On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 8, the low-temperature specific heat C of Ni-substituted samples fits to the following equation:

\[C = C_{\rm d} + C_{\rm ph}\,,\] (2)

where C_{\rm d} {=}\gamma T + bT^{n} with exponent n, which increases from 2 (y{=}\,0) to \sim2.7 (y{=}\,0.01) upon increasing y. The phonon term C_{\rm ph} determined in the previous work was used in the present fitting.[9, 10] The good fit indicates that the electronic T^{2} term observed for unsubstituted LSCO samples changes into \gamma T + bT^{n} (2{<}\,n{<}\,3) in Ni-substituted samples. On the other hand, the electronic T^{2} term changes into \gamma T + bT^{3} in Zn-substituted samples, as previously reported.[10] In Fig. 9, the \gamma value at T{\ll}T_{c} obtained in above fitting is shown for La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}M_{y}O_{4} (M{=}Ni, Zn) with p{=}\,0.16, 0.2, and 0.22 as a function of y. The residual \gamma value at T{\ll}T_{c}, i.e., the residual density of states at E_{F}, N_{\rm res}, is obviously recovered from zero as Ni or Zn atoms are substituted for Cu.[9, 10] The recovery of the \gamma value is much weaker in Ni-substituted samples than in Zn-substituted ones.

It should be remembered here that Ni atoms are substituted as trivalent Ni^{3+} ions in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} (y{<}\,y_{0}) and no Curie term appears (Sec. III.1). This means that Ni^{3+} ions will act as charged impurities, and cause potential scattering of the Cooper pairs. This feature of the Ni^{3+} substitution offers a good opportunity to confirm whether the order parameter of the present superconductor is of a d-wave type or of an extremely anisotropic s-wave one. This is because in d-wave superconductors the potential scattering of the Cooper pairs suppresses the energy gap \Delta(k) around the nodes in the k space, and causes a residual density of states at T{\ll}T_{c}, N_{\rm res}.[9, 10, 37, 38, 39, 40] On the other hand, in extremely anisotropic s-wave superconductors the potential scattering enhances the energy gap \Delta(k) at the nodes, and causes no N_{\rm res}.[40, 41] Therefore, the present experimental result indicating that N_{\rm res} becomes finite in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} (y{<}y_{0}) shows that the present superconductor is of a d-wave type.

Now we refocus on different Zn- and Ni-substitution effects on the superconductivity. As mentioned above, the depression of T_{c} and the recovery of the residual \gamma value at T{\ll}T_{c} is much weaker in Ni-substituted samples than in Zn-substituted ones (Figs. 7 and 9). This means that the pair-breaking effect of the Ni^{3+} substitution is rather moderate in comparison with that of Zn substitution. The moderate pair-breaking effect of Ni^{3+} is consistent with a characteristic T dependence of C_{\rm d} of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} at T{\ll}T_{c} ; i.e., the T dependence of C_{\rm d} changes from aT^{2} to \gamma T + bT^{n} with 2{\leq}n{<}3 as Ni atoms are substituted for Cu in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, as mentioned above (Fig. 8). Such a change can be understood in terms of a moderate potential scattering of Cooper pairs in d-wave superconductors.[39] On the other hand, the change of C_{\rm el} from \alpha T^{2} to \gamma T + bT^{3}, observed for the Zn substitution, is characteristic of the pair-breaking in the unitarity limit.[10, 37]

As mentioned in Sec. III.1, the spin correlation among 3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} spins is seriously disturbed on Cu sites neighboring Zn in Zn-substituted samples, while the disturbance is not significant around Ni in Ni^{3+}-substituted ones. The magnetism within the CuO_{2} plane has been suggested as one of the most plausible origins for the d-wave superconductivity of cuprates.[10, 16, 17, 18, 20, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52] In that case, the serious disturbance of 3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}-spin correlation around each Zn ion will be quite unfavorable to the superconductivity; i.e., the superconductivity will be seriously suppressed over the magnetically disturbed region around each Zn ion. In fact, such a local suppression of the superconductivity around each Zn ion can be demonstrated by analyzing the Zn dependence of the residual

  \gamma value at T <= T_{c} , i.e., N_{\rm res} on the basis of a following simple model. It is assumed in this model that the superconductivity is completely suppressed within a circle centered at each Zn atom with diameter \xi_{0} on each CuO_{2} plane, but little affected outside the circles. The suppressed region \pi(\xi_{0}/2)^{2} contributes to \gamma, i.e., N_{\rm res}. In the present study, to make calculations simple we assumed a sharp boundary between the normal and superconducting regions although the real boundary is of course rather sluggish. This simplified model schematically shown in Fig. 10 is identical with the "swiss cheese" model, which was introduced by Nachumi _et al._ to explain the reduction of the superconducting carrier density in \muSR experiments on Zn-substituted LSCO and YBCO samples.53

Footnote 53: The \chi dependence of \chi on \chi is shown in Fig. 11.

The result of N_{\rm res} calculated using the present model is shown in Fig. 11, where Zn atoms are assumed to be randomly distributed over the CuO_{2} planes. The calculated N_{\rm res} increases linearly with y at low y concentrations while it tends to be saturated at high y concentrations because the neighboring normal regions begin to overlap each other. The experimental results of the \gamma value at T <= T_{c} are also shown in Fig. 11. Since unsubstituted LSCO samples with x <= 0.15 exhibit a small residual \gamma value, \gamma_{0}, at T <= T_{c} , we subtract \gamma_{0} from the observed \gamma value of Zn-substituted samples: \gamma_{0} = 1 and 0.5 mJ/mole K^{2} for x = 0.1 and 0.14 samples, respectively. As seen in Fig. 11, the \gamma values for x = 0.1, 0.14, 0.16, and 0.18 fit very well to the results of N_{\rm res} calculated for \xi_{0} = 46, 39, 36.5, and 34.5 A, respectively.

If \xi_{0} is relevant to the superconducting correlation length \xi_{s} \propto (2 D_{0})^{-1}, \xi_{0} should increase with x because the superconducting energy gap 2 D_{0} was found to decrease with x at least at x >= 0.14 in the present system.10,54 However, in the present experimental results this is not the case; \xi_{0} monotonically decreases with increasing x between x = 0.10 and 0.18 (the inset in Fig. 11). This implies that \xi_{0} is not inherent in the superconductivity. It should be noted here that the characteristic length \xi_{0} = 39 A for samples with x = 0.14 is comparable to the antiferromagnetic correlation length \xi_{\rm AF} (\sim 35 A) at low temperatures, which is reported in inelastic neutron scattering experiments on La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (x = 0.14).55 Furthermore, the \xi_{\rm AF} has a trend similar to that of \xi_{0} with x, namely, it decreases with increasing x.56 Therefore, \xi_{0} can be considered as the characteristic length relevant to \xi_{\rm AF} rather than \xi_{s} . This means that the superconductivity will be seriously suppressed over a magnetically-disturbed region (\sim\xi_{\rm AF}) around each Zn ion.

Footnote 56: The \xi_{\rm AF} dependence of \xi_{0} is shown in Fig. 11.

## IV Summary

In the present study, we measured the magnetic susceptibility and the electronic specific heat on Zn- and Ni-substituted La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} samples. It was found that Ni atoms are substituted as trivalent Ni^{3+} ions below a critical Ni concentration, y_{0} , in an x range above x \sim 0.14. The substitution of Ni^{3+} for Cu causes a prominent hole-consumption effect, leading to an increase of T_{\rm max} and a reduction of the \gamma_{\rm Ni} value. The Ni^{3+} substitution causes no Curie term though Ni^{3+} is nominally magnetic, indicating that magnetic channels among 3_d__{x^{2}-y^{2}} spins survive even at Ni^{3+} sites. On the other hand, in Zn-substituted samples, the spin correlation among 3_d__{x^{2}-y^{2}} spins is seriously disturbed on host Cu sites around each Zn ion because the magnetic channels are absent at nonmagnetic Zn ions.

It was confirmed that the superconductivity is suppressed much more strongly in Zn-substituted samples than in Ni^{3+}-substituted ones; the depression of T_{c} and the residual density of states at T <= T_{c} is much larger in Zn-substituted samples than in Ni^{3+}-substituted ones. The suppression of superconductivity in Ni^{3+}-substituted samples can be understood in the context of a potential scattering of Cooper pairs in a d-wave superconductor. On the other hand, in the Zn

The solid lines represent the residual density of states calculated on the basis of the model schematically shown in Fig. 10. The inset shows the x dependence of \xi_{0}.

Only the Cu sites are represented. The closed and open circles are Cu and Zn ions, respectively. The normal states are recovered over the shaded region with the diameter \xi_{0}.

  substituted samples the superconductivity is seriously suppressed through disturbance of the 3d_{x^{2}-,y^{2}}-spin correlation on host Cu sites around each Zn ion. This implies that the 3d_{x^{2}-,y^{2}}-spin correlation within the CuO_{2} plane will play a crucial role in causing superconductivity.

###### Abstract

Both Ni- and Zn-substitution effects on superconducting and magnetic properties of La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 were studied by measuring the magnetic susceptibility _kh_ and the electronic specific heat _C_d at T <= _T_c_ . In Ni-substituted samples with x >= 0.14, the local nature of the spin correlation among 3d spins remains almost unchanged even on Ni sites at low Ni concentrations, where Ni atoms are substituted as Ni2+ ions. On the other hand, in Zn-substituted samples the 3_d_-spin correlation is seriously disturbed on host Cu sites around each Zn site. The depression of _T_c and the residual g value at T <= _T_c_ indicate that the suppression of the superconductivity in Zn-substituted samples is much stronger than that in Ni3+-substituted ones. The suppression of the superconductivity in the Ni3+-substituted samples can be understood in the context of a potential scattering of the Cooper pairs in a _d_-wave superconductor. On the other hand, the strong suppression of the superconductivity in the Zn-substituted samples will occur through the local disturbance of the 3_d_-spin correlation on host Cu sites around each Zn ion.

## I Introduction

In typical high-_T_c cuprates such as YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (YBCO) and La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 (LSCO), partial substitution of nonmagnetic ions such as Zn2+ and Al3+ for Cu leads to stronger suppression of the superconductivity than substitution of nominally magnetic Ni ions, which is in sharp contrast with the conventional superconductors.1-5 It has been found in NMR experiments that partial substitution of Zn or Al induces localized magnetic moments on host Cu sites neighboring Zn or Al.6-8 Therefore, the induced local-magnetic moments were invoked to suggest magnetic pair breaking as possible origins of the strong suppression of _T_c in Zn- or Al-substituted LSCO and YBCO samples.1,3,7 However, Ishida _et al._ have performed 27Al NMR studies on Al-substituted LSCO, whose _T_c is suppressed to almost the same extent as that in Zn-substituted LSCO, and found that the magnetic pair breaking due to the local magnetic moments induced by the substitution of nonmagnetic ions is too weak to explain the rapid suppression of _T_c .8 It has been reported for both LSCO and YBCO systems that the Zn substitution causes a large residual density of states at _E_F at T  _t_c , _N_res , in addition to the rapid suppression of _T_c , _T_c . The _N_res vs _T_c relation can be qualitatively explained on the basis of a _d_-wave superconductor by assuming that nonmagnetic Zn ions act as strong potential scatterers in the unitarity limit.9-13 However, the _N_res vs _D_T_c relation obtained for LSCO samples with x <= 0.18 obviously deviates from the theoretical prediction.10

In comparison with nonmagnetic ions such as Zn2+ and Al3+, nominally magnetic Ni ions lead to a moderate effect not only on the superconductivity but also on the local magnetism at host Cu sites neighboring Ni in the YBCO system.2,12-15 It was demonstrated by NMR studies on the YBCO system that the spin-lattice relaxation time 63T1 of 63Cu is only slightly modified even on planar Cu sites around Ni ions, whereas 63T1 is largely modified on planar Cu sites around Zn ions on account of a local disturbance of spin correlation among Cu 3d spins.12-14 Mendels _et al._ measured the Curie term on Ni-substituted YBCO samples, and found that the Curie constant corresponds to S = 1/2 rather than S = 1, though usually S = 1 is expected for Ni2+ ions.15 They explained the results as follows: an isolated 3d spin in the 3d3_2-_r_2 orbital of Ni2+, whose magnetic channels to neighboring host Cu 3d2-_r_2 spins are very weak, will contribute to the Curie term corresponding to S = 1/2, while a spin in the Ni 3d2-_r_2 orbital can couple antiferromagnetically to neighboring Cu 3d2-_r_2 spins; that is, the magnetic channel between 3d2-_r_2 spins survives at Ni sites. The survival of the magnetic channels will preserve the local nature of the 3d2-_r_2-spin correlation on host Cu sites around Ni sites. Recently the superconductivity of cuprates was found to be of a _d_-wave type, and antiferromagnetic interaction within the CuO2 plane has received more attention than ever as a candidate for the origin of the superconductivity.10,16-20 Therefore, the preservation of the local nature of the 3d2-_r_2-spin correlation has become of interest to explain the milder pair-breaking effect of Ni than that of Zn in the YBCO system.15 It has also been reported for the LSCO system that the superconductivity is less suppressed in Ni-substituted samples than in Zn-substituted ones.1,3,5 To understand the reason why the substitution effects on the superconductivity are rather different between nominally magnetic Ni and nonmagnetic Zn, we should clarify their substitution effects on the magnetic properties in the LSCO system as well as the YBCO system. However, the Ni-substitution effect on magnetic properties has not been systematically studied for the LSCO system yet.

In the present study, we investigate both Ni- and Zn-substitution effects on magnetic properties and superconductivity of LSCO by measuring the magnetic susceptibility _kh_ and the electronic specific heat _C_d at T <= _T_c . It was found in  Ni-substituted LSCO with x >= 0.14 that the spin correlation among 3_d_x_2-,y2 spins remains unchanged even on Ni sites below the critical Ni concentration y0, where Ni atoms are substituted as trivalent Ni3+ ions. On the other hand, in Zn-substituted samples the 3_d_x_2-,y2-spin correlation is seriously disturbed on host Cu sites around each Zn site because the magnetic channels between 3_d_x_2-,y2 spins are disrupted at nonmagnetic Zn ions. It was also found that the depression of _T_c and the residual density of states at E_{F} at T <= _T_c are much smaller in Ni3+-substituted samples than in Zn-substituted ones. We discuss the difference between Ni- and Zn-substitution effects on the superconductivity in terms of the local disturbance of the 3_d_x_2-,y2-spin correlation.

## II Experiments

A master batch of high-purity La2-,Sr2Cu1-,M,O4 (_M_ = Ni, Zn) samples was prepared using La2O3, SrCO3, CuO, NiO, and ZnO powders of high purity (99.99-99.999 %) at 1050-1150 degC in an oxygen atmosphere with one intermediate grinding, followed by annealing in an oxygen atmosphere at 600 degC for 24 h. Each sample was fully characterized by x-ray diffraction and confirmed to be single phase.

Magnetic susceptibility was measured by using a Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer. The magnetic susceptibility in the normal state was measured under a magnetic field of 10 kOe in a _T_-range below ~600 K in both courses of heating and cooling. There was no degradation of samples due to oxygen deficiency, at least in the _T_-range examined. Measurements of the superconducting diamagnetism were carried out under a field of 15 Oe. The specific-heat capacity was measured by a conventional adiabatic heat pulse method within a T2 range from 4 K2 to 50 K2. Details of the measurements have been reported elsewhere.9,10

## III Results and Discussion

### Substitution effect on the magnetic susceptibility

In Figs. 1 and 2, the magnetic susceptibility _kh_ is shown for the normal state of La2-,Sr2Cu1-,M,O4 (_M_ = Ni, Zn) with x = 0.2. The _kh_ -_T_ curve of La2-,Sr2Cu1-,M,_Y_O4 exhibits a broad peak at temperature _T_max as well as that of La2-,Sr2CuO4 (LSCO).21-29 In Zn-substituted samples, the position of the broad peak weakly depends on Zn concentration y though the broad peak is obscured by the appearance of the Curie term at Zn concentrations of more than 1%. On the other hand, in Ni-substituted samples the position of the broad peak of the _kh_ -_T_ curve largely shifts to higher temperatures with increase in Ni concentration y at y < 0.03, and the shift tends to be saturated at y >= 0.03 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, in Ni-substituted samples with y < 0.03, no evident Curie term was observed at low temperatures though Ni ions are nominally magnetic.

In our previous study, the magnetic susceptibility of Zn-substituted LSCO samples was analyzed by assuming that it contains a _T_-dependent spin component, _kh_'(_T_), and a _T_-independent one, _kh_0, in addition to the Curie component _C_/_T_, i.e.,

\[\chi = \chi^{\prime}(T) + \chi^{0} + C/T,\]

where component _kh_'(_T_) is characterized by a broad peak at _T_max.22 Both the characteristic temperature, _T_max, and the size of _kh_'(_T_) largely depend on the Sr concentration, namely, the hole concentration p within the CuO2 plane, but the normalized _kh_'(_T_) vs T curve, _kh_'(_T_/_T_max)/_kh_'(_T_max) vs _T_/_T_max, follows a universal curve, F, which is the same universal curve as that identified for LSCO samples, regardless of p.22,230 Universal curve F can be understood in terms of an S = 1/2 square-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet at high temperatures (_T_ >= 0.7_T_max).22,24,30 In the present study, we fitted the data of Ni-substituted samples to Eq. (1) using the same universal curve F. As seen in Fig. 2, the _kh_ -_T_ curves of Ni-substituted samples can be reproduced very well.

In Figs. 3 and 4, the Curie constant and temperature _T_max determined in the above analyses are shown for La2-,Sr2Cu1-,Ni2O4 (0.14 <= x <= 0.22) as a function of y. As seen in Fig. 3, it was confirmed that there exists no additional Curie term in Ni-substituted samples up to a certain value, y0, while the Curie term appears at y > y0. The details of the Curie term will be mentioned later. It should be noticed in Fig. 4 that _T_max rapidly increases with increasing y up to the value y0, while the increase of _T_max tends to be saturated at

  y\!>\!y_{0} . The characteristic Ni-concentration y_{0} increases with increasing x (the inset of Fig. 4). Since T_{\rm max} was found to increase with a decrease in the hole concentration p(\!=\!x) in unsubstituted LSCO samples (Fig. 5), [22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29] the increase of T_{\rm max} with Ni concentration suggests that the substitution of Ni for Cu may reduce the hole concentration p. A possible origin of the hole reduction is that Ni atoms will be substituted as trivalent Ni^{3+} ions, because the substitution of a Ni^{3+} ion for a Cu^{2+} consumes a hole within the CuO_{2} plane. Such a possibility has already been pointed out by Bhat _et al._ on the basis of different T_{c}\!-\!x curves between Ni-free and Ni-substituted LSCO systems.[31] If Ni atoms are substituted as trivalent ions in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} the hole concentration p should be given by p\!=\!x\!-\!y, instead of p\!=\!x. In fact, when T_{\rm max} of La_{1.8}Sr_{0.2}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} (y\!<\!y_{0}) is plotted as a function of p\!=\!0.2\!-\!y , it agrees very well with the data of Ni-free La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} samples with x\!=\!0.2\!-\!y , as seen in Fig. 5. The good agreement supports the possibility that all Ni atoms will be substituted as trivalent Ni^{3+} ions at y\leq\!y_{0} . In this context, the saturation of T_{\rm max} at y\!>\!y_{0} means that p will be fixed at p\!=\!x\!-\!y_{0} ; i.e., some Ni ions, y_{0} , become trivalent while the rest of them, y\!-\!y_{0} , are divalent.

Studies of the electronic specific heat C_{\rm d} on nonsuperconducting La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}_{M}O_{4} (M\!=\!Ni, Zn) samples also support the possibility that Ni will be substituted as Ni^{3+} at y\!<\!y_{0} . In the inset of Fig. 5, the coefficient of the T-linear term of C_{\rm d}, \gamma_{N} , is shown for nonsuperconducting La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}_{M}O_{4} (M\!=\!Ni, Zn) as a function of x. The \gamma_{N} value is evidently smaller in Ni-substituted samples than in Zn-substituted ones, as has already reported by Hiroi _et al.[32]_ Here, to take into account the hole consumption effect of Ni^{3+}, we replot the \gamma_{N} value of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} against p\!=\!x\!-\!y_{0} regarding the horizontal axis x as p in the inset of Fig. 5. In this plot, the \gamma_{N} values of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} (p\!=\!x\!-\!y_{0}) are in agreement with those of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Zn_{y}O_{4} (p\!=\!x), as expected.

Now we refocus on the result showing that the Ni substitution induces no additional Curie term in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} (y\!<\!y_{0}) samples. Figure 6 shows the \chi\!-\!T curve for La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} (y\!<\!y_{0}), whose hole concentration p was kept at 0.16 regardless of y, that is, x was always chosen to hold p(\!=\!x\!-\!y)\!=\!0.16 for any given y(\!<\!y_{0}). In Fig. 6, the reduced temperature T/T_{\rm max} is used to correct a small difference of p among different samples, \Delta p, which was inadvertently introduced; the present \Delta p(\!\simeq\!0.002) corresponds to the shift of \pm\!10 K in T_{\rm max} . Each set of data is shifted as a whole, at most, by \sim5% along the vertical axis in order to remove the offset value of \chi, which was due to accidental errors characteristic of the apparatus. It should be noticed in Fig. 6 that the \chi\!-\!T curves for La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} (y\!<\!y_{0}) agree well with that for the Ni-free sample over a wide temperature range without any correction of the Curie term; that is, no Curie term appears in Ni-substituted samples with y\!<\!y_{0} . This indicates that there exist no isolated spins on Ni sites in  La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} (y<y_{0}) samples and the local nature of spin correlation among 3_d_x_2-,y2 spins is not seriously changed on Cu sites around Ni. Such a Ni^{3+}-substitution effect on the 3_d_x_2-,y2-spin correlation is in sharp contrast to the Zn-substitution effect; in Zn-substituted samples the 3_d_-spin correlation is seriously disturbed on Cu site around each Zn because the magnetic channel among 3_d_x_2-,y2 spins is disrupted at nonmagnetic Zn sites, and a resultant Curie term appears.[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]

It is noteworthy that the absence of the Curie term in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} (y<y_{0}) samples can not be understood in terms of divalent Ni^{2+} ions. The reason is as follows. There are two different possible 3d configurations for divalent Ni^{2+} ions in the present case: magnetic configuration d_{x_2-,y2}[2]d_{3_2}2-,y2[1] and nonmagnetic one d_{x_2-,y2}[2]d_{3_2}2-,y2[2]d_{3_2}2-,y2[3]d  value.[10] The decrease of T_{c} is slower in Ni-substituted samples than in Zn-substituted ones, as reported by Tararscon _et al._ and Xiao _et al._[1, 3]_

In Fig. 8, typical results of the specific heat at T{<}T_{c} are shown for La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}M_{y}O_{4} (M{=}Ni, Zn) with p = 0.16 and 0.22 with C/T versus T^{2} plot. The low-temperature specific heat of unsubstituted LSCO samples fits to the sum of an electronic T^{2} term and a phonon T^{3} term at T{\ll}T_{c}.[9, 10] The quadratic behavior of the electronic specific heat C_{\rm d} is peculiar to superconductors with line nodes in the gap structure, such as d-wave and extremely anisotropic s-wave superconductors.[9, 10, 36, 37] On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 8, the low-temperature specific heat C of Ni-substituted samples fits to the following equation:

\[C = C_{\rm d} + C_{\rm ph}\,,\] (2)

where C_{\rm d} {=}\gamma T + bT^{n} with exponent n, which increases from 2 (y{=}\,0) to \sim2.7 (y{=}\,0.01) upon increasing y. The phonon term C_{\rm ph} determined in the previous work was used in the present fitting.[9, 10] The good fit indicates that the electronic T^{2} term observed for unsubstituted LSCO samples changes into \gamma T + bT^{n} (2{<}\,n{<}\,3) in Ni-substituted samples. On the other hand, the electronic T^{2} term changes into \gamma T + bT^{3} in Zn-substituted samples, as previously reported.[10] In Fig. 9, the \gamma value at T{\ll}T_{c} obtained in above fitting is shown for La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}M_{y}O_{4} (M{=}Ni, Zn) with p{=}\,0.16, 0.2, and 0.22 as a function of y. The residual \gamma value at T{\ll}T_{c}, i.e., the residual density of states at E_{F}, N_{\rm res}, is obviously recovered from zero as Ni or Zn atoms are substituted for Cu.[9, 10] The recovery of the \gamma value is much weaker in Ni-substituted samples than in Zn-substituted ones.

It should be remembered here that Ni atoms are substituted as trivalent Ni^{3+} ions in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} (y{<}\,y_{0}) and no Curie term appears (Sec. III.1). This means that Ni^{3+} ions will act as charged impurities, and cause potential scattering of the Cooper pairs. This feature of the Ni^{3+} substitution offers a good opportunity to confirm whether the order parameter of the present superconductor is of a d-wave type or of an extremely anisotropic s-wave one. This is because in d-wave superconductors the potential scattering of the Cooper pairs suppresses the energy gap \Delta(k) around the nodes in the k space, and causes a residual density of states at T{\ll}T_{c}, N_{\rm res}.[9, 10, 37, 38, 39, 40] On the other hand, in extremely anisotropic s-wave superconductors the potential scattering enhances the energy gap \Delta(k) at the nodes, and causes no N_{\rm res}.[40, 41] Therefore, the present experimental result indicating that N_{\rm res} becomes finite in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} (y{<}y_{0}) shows that the present superconductor is of a d-wave type.

Now we refocus on different Zn- and Ni-substitution effects on the superconductivity. As mentioned above, the depression of T_{c} and the recovery of the residual \gamma value at T{\ll}T_{c} is much weaker in Ni-substituted samples than in Zn-substituted ones (Figs. 7 and 9). This means that the pair-breaking effect of the Ni^{3+} substitution is rather moderate in comparison with that of Zn substitution. The moderate pair-breaking effect of Ni^{3+} is consistent with a characteristic T dependence of C_{\rm d} of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-y}Ni_{y}O_{4} at T{\ll}T_{c} ; i.e., the T dependence of C_{\rm d} changes from aT^{2} to \gamma T + bT^{n} with 2{\leq}n{<}3 as Ni atoms are substituted for Cu in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, as mentioned above (Fig. 8). Such a change can be understood in terms of a moderate potential scattering of Cooper pairs in d-wave superconductors.[39] On the other hand, the change of C_{\rm el} from \alpha T^{2} to \gamma T + bT^{3}, observed for the Zn substitution, is characteristic of the pair-breaking in the unitarity limit.[10, 37]

As mentioned in Sec. III.1, the spin correlation among 3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} spins is seriously disturbed on Cu sites neighboring Zn in Zn-substituted samples, while the disturbance is not significant around Ni in Ni^{3+}-substituted ones. The magnetism within the CuO_{2} plane has been suggested as one of the most plausible origins for the d-wave superconductivity of cuprates.[10, 16, 17, 18, 20, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52] In that case, the serious disturbance of 3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}-spin correlation around each Zn ion will be quite unfavorable to the superconductivity; i.e., the superconductivity will be seriously suppressed over the magnetically disturbed region around each Zn ion. In fact, such a local suppression of the superconductivity around each Zn ion can be demonstrated by analyzing the Zn dependence of the residual

  \gamma value at T <= T_{c} , i.e., N_{\rm res} on the basis of a following simple model. It is assumed in this model that the superconductivity is completely suppressed within a circle centered at each Zn atom with diameter \xi_{0} on each CuO_{2} plane, but little affected outside the circles. The suppressed region \pi(\xi_{0}/2)^{2} contributes to \gamma, i.e., N_{\rm res}. In the present study, to make calculations simple we assumed a sharp boundary between the normal and superconducting regions although the real boundary is of course rather sluggish. This simplified model schematically shown in Fig. 10 is identical with the "swiss cheese" model, which was introduced by Nachumi _et al._ to explain the reduction of the superconducting carrier density in \muSR experiments on Zn-substituted LSCO and YBCO samples.53

Footnote 53: The \chi dependence of \chi on \chi is shown in Fig. 11.

The result of N_{\rm res} calculated using the present model is shown in Fig. 11, where Zn atoms are assumed to be randomly distributed over the CuO_{2} planes. The calculated N_{\rm res} increases linearly with y at low y concentrations while it tends to be saturated at high y concentrations because the neighboring normal regions begin to overlap each other. The experimental results of the \gamma value at T <= T_{c} are also shown in Fig. 11. Since unsubstituted LSCO samples with x <= 0.15 exhibit a small residual \gamma value, \gamma_{0}, at T <= T_{c} , we subtract \gamma_{0} from the observed \gamma value of Zn-substituted samples: \gamma_{0} = 1 and 0.5 mJ/mole K^{2} for x = 0.1 and 0.14 samples, respectively. As seen in Fig. 11, the \gamma values for x = 0.1, 0.14, 0.16, and 0.18 fit very well to the results of N_{\rm res} calculated for \xi_{0} = 46, 39, 36.5, and 34.5 A, respectively.

If \xi_{0} is relevant to the superconducting correlation length \xi_{s} \propto (2 D_{0})^{-1}, \xi_{0} should increase with x because the superconducting energy gap 2 D_{0} was found to decrease with x at least at x >= 0.14 in the present system.10,54 However, in the present experimental results this is not the case; \xi_{0} monotonically decreases with increasing x between x = 0.10 and 0.18 (the inset in Fig. 11). This implies that \xi_{0} is not inherent in the superconductivity. It should be noted here that the characteristic length \xi_{0} = 39 A for samples with x = 0.14 is comparable to the antiferromagnetic correlation length \xi_{\rm AF} (\sim 35 A) at low temperatures, which is reported in inelastic neutron scattering experiments on La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (x = 0.14).55 Furthermore, the \xi_{\rm AF} has a trend similar to that of \xi_{0} with x, namely, it decreases with increasing x.56 Therefore, \xi_{0} can be considered as the characteristic length relevant to \xi_{\rm AF} rather than \xi_{s} . This means that the superconductivity will be seriously suppressed over a magnetically-disturbed region (\sim\xi_{\rm AF}) around each Zn ion.

Footnote 56: The \xi_{\rm AF} dependence of \xi_{0} is shown in Fig. 11.

## IV Summary

In the present study, we measured the magnetic susceptibility and the electronic specific heat on Zn- and Ni-substituted La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} samples. It was found that Ni atoms are substituted as trivalent Ni^{3+} ions below a critical Ni concentration, y_{0} , in an x range above x \sim 0.14. The substitution of Ni^{3+} for Cu causes a prominent hole-consumption effect, leading to an increase of T_{\rm max} and a reduction of the \gamma_{\rm Ni} value. The Ni^{3+} substitution causes no Curie term though Ni^{3+} is nominally magnetic, indicating that magnetic channels among 3_d__{x^{2}-y^{2}} spins survive even at Ni^{3+} sites. On the other hand, in Zn-substituted samples, the spin correlation among 3_d__{x^{2}-y^{2}} spins is seriously disturbed on host Cu sites around each Zn ion because the magnetic channels are absent at nonmagnetic Zn ions.

It was confirmed that the superconductivity is suppressed much more strongly in Zn-substituted samples than in Ni^{3+}-substituted ones; the depression of T_{c} and the residual density of states at T <= T_{c} is much larger in Zn-substituted samples than in Ni^{3+}-substituted ones. The suppression of superconductivity in Ni^{3+}-substituted samples can be understood in the context of a potential scattering of Cooper pairs in a d-wave superconductor. On the other hand, in the Zn

The solid lines represent the residual density of states calculated on the basis of the model schematically shown in Fig. 10. The inset shows the x dependence of \xi_{0}.

Only the Cu sites are represented. The closed and open circles are Cu and Zn ions, respectively. The normal states are recovered over the shaded region with the diameter \xi_{0}.

  substituted samples the superconductivity is seriously suppressed through disturbance of the 3d_{x^{2}-,y^{2}}-spin correlation on host Cu sites around each Zn ion. This implies that the 3d_{x^{2}-,y^{2}}-spin correlation within the CuO_{2} plane will play a crucial role in causing superconductivity.
