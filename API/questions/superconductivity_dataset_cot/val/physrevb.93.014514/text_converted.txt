###### Abstract

The low-temperature electronic phase diagram of Ba1-xNaFe2As2, obtained
using high-resolution thermal-expansion and specific-heat measurements,
is shown to be considerably more complex than previously reported,
containing nine different phases. Besides the magnetic C2 and reentrant
C4 phases, we find evidence for an additional, presumably magnetic,
phase below the usual spin-density-wave transition, as well as a
possible incommensurate magnetic phase. All these phases coexist and
compete with superconductivity, which is particularly strongly
suppressed by the C4-magnetic phase due to a strong reduction of the
electronic entropy available for pairing in this phase.

High-temperature superconductivity in Fe-based systems usually emerges
when a stripe-type antiferromagnetic spin-density wave (SDW) is
suppressed by either doping or pressure [1-3]. The SDW transition is
accompanied, or sometimes even slightly preceded, by a structural phase
transition from a high-temperature tetragonal (_C_4) to a
low-temperature orthorhombic (_C_2) state, which has sparked the lively
debate about electronic nematicity and the respective role of spin and
orbital physics in these materials [4-8]. In the hole-doped compounds,
Ba1-xNaFe2As2, Ba1-xKFe2As2, and Sr1-xNaFe2As2, recent studies have
shown that the C4 symmetry is restored in a small pocket within the
magnetic C2 phase region [9-13]. Mossbauer studies on Sr0.63Na0.37Fe2As2
find that only half of the Fe sites carry a magnetic moment in this
phase [12], which is consistent with the double-_Q_ magnetic structure
predicted within the itinerant spin-nematic scenario [6,9,12,14].
Moreover, neutron studies have shown that the spins flip from in-plane
in the C2 phase to out-of-plane in the C4 reentrant phase [15],
indicating that spin-orbit interactions cannot be neglected. In the
Ba1-xKFe2As2 system, the reentrant C4 phase reverts back to the C2 phase
near the onset of superconductivity, due to a stronger competition of
the C4 phase with superconductivity [10]. The presence of this phase in
the hole-doped systems presents strong evidence that the physics of
these Fe-based systems can be treated in an itinerant picture, and
recent theoretical studies based upon the spin-nematic scenario can
reproduce phase diagrams very similar to the experimental ones [16], as
well as the spin reorientation in the C4 phase if spin-orbit
interactions are included [17].

Here, we reinvestigate in greater detail the low-temperature electronic
phase diagram of Ba1-xNaFe2As2 using high-resolution thermal-expansion
and specific-heat measurements, and show that it is considerably more
complex than previously reported, containing nine different phases.
Besides the usual C2 and reentrant C4 magnetic phases, we find evidence
for an additional, presumably magnetic, C2 phase, in which the
orthorhombic distortion is substantially reduced but still finite. These
phases coexist and compete with superconductivity, which is particularly
strongly suppressed by the reentrant C4 phase. Further, we provide
indications that the SDW transition becomes incommensurate above x =
0.22, which appears linked to the emergence of the C4 phase at this
composition. The surprising occurrence of this multitude of phases near
the onset of superconductivity suggests a highly degenerate free-energy
landscape near optimal doping, which may be related to the occurrence of
superconductivity in the Fe-based systems.

Single crystals of Ba1-xNaFe2As2 were grown in alumina crucibles using a
self-flux method with (Ba,Na): FeAs ratios 1:4-1:5. The crucibles were
sealed in iron cylinders filled with argon gas. After heating to
1150-1170 degC, the furnace was cooled down slowly at rates between 0.3
and 0.5 degC/h to minimize the amount of flux inclusions. Near 940-1020
degC the furnace was turned upside down to separate the remaining liquid
flux from the grown crystals and then cooled down to room temperature
with intermediate holds to _in situ_ anneal the crystals. Thermal
expansion was measured using a high-resolution home-made capacitance
dilatometer [18], which is several orders of magnitude more sensitive
than traditional diffraction techniques. Heat capacity was measured
using a Physical Property Measurement System from Quantum Design. The
electronic specific heat was obtained by subtracting an appropriate
phonon background [10,19,20]. Specifically, as demonstrated for
Ba1-xKFe2As2[10,21], the phonon background can be approximated as the
weighted sum of the individual lattice contributions of its
"constituents" [22], which are BaFe2As2 and NaFe2As2 for the present
case. Since there are no crystals of NaFe2As2, we determined the
hypothetical NaFe2As2 phonon background by assuming that the electronic
components at optimal doping of Na- and K-doped [10] systems are
identical. This is quite reasonable, since both _T_c and the heat
capacity jumps at optimal doping are very similar in both systems. The
Na content of seven single crystals [_x_ = 0.093(4), 0.182(2), 0.221(2),
0.283(2), 0.320(2), 0.360(3), and 0.401(4)] used for the
thermal-expansion and specific-heat measurements was accurately
determined by four-circle single-crystal x-ray refinement of a small
piece of the measured crystals. The Na content of the other crystals
were interpolated between these fixed points using the SDW transition
temperature as a reference. The values of the structural parameters from
our x-ray refinement are in good agreement with previous results [23].

Figure 1(a) presents the relative thermal expansion, ΔL/L, measured
along the a and b axes for three representative Na doping levels. As we
have demonstrated previously [10, 24], the shorter b axis in the
low-temperature orthorhombic phase can be obtained directly by measuring
the expansion of the crystal along the [110]_(T) direction of the
original tetragonal cell, because in this configuration the small force
from the dilatometer detwins the crystal. The larger a axis, on the
other hand, is obtained by combining a "twinned" measurement (along
[100]_(T)) with the "detwinned" data [10, 24]. The expected orthorhombic
splitting of the a and b lattice parameters at the SDW transition at
T_(s, N) is clearly observed for all three concentrations and reduces in
magnitude with increasing Na content. For the x = 0.265 sample, this
splitting suddenly disappears, within the accuracy of the measurements,
at a first-order transition at T₁ = 45 K, which we identify with the C₄
magnetic phase [9, 10].

orthorhombic lattice parameters a and b of Ba_(1 − x)Na_(x)Fe₂As₂ for Na
doping levels of x = 0, 0.221, 0.265 obtained using high-resolution
capacitance dilatometry (see text for details). (b) Temperature
dependence of the orthorhombic distortion δ = (a − b)/(a + b) inferred
from the data in (a). The inset presents an expanded view of the data at
higher doping levels. Vertical arrows indicate the location of the
superconducting transition at T_(c), the C₄-reentrant transition at T₁,
and the stripe-type SDW transition at T_(s, N).

In order to study the doping evolution of these transitions in greater
detail, we present in Fig. 1(b) the orthorhombic distortion,
δ = (a − b)/(a + b), inferred from our thermal-expansion data for a
number of compositions between x = 0 and x = 0.36. We detect clear
signatures of the structural distortion associated with the SDW
transition at T_(s, N) all the way to x = 0.36, which is considerably
higher than observed previously by neutron diffraction [9, 23]. We note,
however, that the orthorhombic splitting becomes extremely small in this
high-doping region [see inset of Fig. 1(b)], which is probably why it
was missed previously. The presence of the reentrant C₄ phase is
signaled by a sudden disappearance of δ at T₁, which we observe for
0.22 ≤ x ≤ 0.29. The behavior of the lattice parameters changes
dramatically for x = 0.302, where we observe a more gradual reduction of
δ at T₁, indicative of a second-order transition, followed by a
previously unobserved transition at T₂. Upon further doping, the
transition at T₂ disappears and the transitions at T_(s, N) and T₁
appear to merge together. The well-known reduction of δ at the
superconducting transition in the C₂ SDW phase due to the competition
between superconductivity and magnetism [24, 25, 26] is clearly observed
for the crystal with x = 0.221, whereas the effect of superconductivity
on the in-plane lattice parameters in the C₄ phase is too small to be
seen in these curves.

Figure 2: (a)–(f) In-plane thermal expansion coefficients in “twinned”
(solid lines) and “detwinned” (dashed lines) orientations versus T for
Na concentrations of x = 0.182, 0.265, 0.302, 0.318, 0.36, and 0.401.
The location of the various phase transitions is marked by vertical
arrows. The breaking of the C₄ symmetry at T_(s, N) in (a)–(e) is
clearly indicated by the anisotropy of the “twinned” and “detwinned”
expansion coefficients below T_(s, N). On the other hand, the reentrant
C₄ phase is characterized by equivalent expansion coefficients below T₁
in (b) and between T₂ and T_(c) in (c). The near optimally doped sample
in (f) exhibits only a well-defined jump at T_(c).

The small anomalies associated with the onset of T_(c), as well as the
other phase transitions, are more clearly observed in the
thermal-expansion coefficients,
$\alpha(T)=\frac{1}{L}\frac{d\lambda(T)}{dT}$, for the "twinned" and
"detwinned" directions, which are presented as α/T versus T for
representative Na contents in Fig. 2. Figure 2(a) displays data for the
crystal with x = 0.182, which becomes orthorhombic below T_(s, N) = 112
K and superconducting below T_(c) = 6.5 K. The clear anisotropy of the
in-plane expansion below T_(s, N), as well as the anisotropic response
at T_(c), are indicative of the expected orthorhombic state at this
doping level. We note that the small anisotropic tail above T_(s, N)
results from the small, but finite, uniaxial pressure we apply in our
dilatometer [10]. In contrast to the behavior for x = 0.182, the
anisotropy of the expansivity vanishes nearly completely below the
transition at T₁ for the x = 0.265 sample [see Fig. 2(b)], indicating
the reentrant tetragonal state below T₁. As expected at the onset of
superconductivity, small jumplike anomalies at T_(c) are observed for
both directions. The behavior of the x = 0.302 crystal is more
complicated [see Fig. 2(c)]. Here the crystal clearly becomes
orthorhombic at T_(s, N), then δ(T) decreases gradually between T₁ and
T₂ [see inset of Fig. 1(b)], but remains orthorhombic. The expansivities
for both orientations are equal below T₂, suggesting that the system
again enters a tetragonal state. The curves below T_(c), however, again
exhibit an anisotropic response, suggesting that the C₄ phase reverts
back to the C₂^(′) phase below T_(c), in analogy to what has been
observed in K-doped BaFe₂As₂[10]. There is an additional sharp anomaly
at T_(L) = 10 K for both orientations, which is, however, observed only
upon heating, possibly indicating another phase transition with a large
thermal hysteresis. Nearly identical behavior was observed in another
crystal with a similar composition. Our expansion data thus clearly show
that the reentrant C₄ phase exists only in a limited temperature range
between T₂ and T_(c) for x = 0.302. The transitions at T₂ and T_(L) both
disappear for the next higher Na content [see Fig. 2(d)], and this
sample also clearly displays strongly anisotropic thermal expansivities
below T_(s, N), which is incompatible with a C₄ symmetry. The x = 0.36
crystal [Fig. 2(e)] exhibits only very small effects at T_(s, N) and T₁.
Finally, any signature of the anomaly at T_(s, N) has disappeared in the
crystal with x = 0.401, which only has a clear anomaly at T_(c) = 35 K.

The transition temperatures T_(s, N), T_(c), T₁, T₂, and T_(L) obtained
by the thermal-expansion data shown in Figs. 1 and 2 allow us to
construct a detailed phase diagram [see Fig. 3(b)]. Here, we have also
included the transition temperatures extracted from the heat-capacity
data (see Fig. 4). The phase diagram exhibits a remarkable degree of
complexity, with a surprising number of additional (other than the usual
C₂-magnetic and superconductivity) phases emerging as magnetism is
suppressed by Na doping. We note that these phases appear to emerge at
the point where T_(s, N) changes curvature from concave to convex near
x = 0.22. This change is indicated by the changing color of the line
from blue to red. The doping dependence of the extrapolated
zero-temperature orthorhombic distortion of the C₂ phase [see Fig. 3(a)]
illustrates this change even more clearly, with a very distinct kink
near x = 0.22. We interpret the inflection point of T_(s, N)(x) as a
sign for a commensurate-to-incommensurate transition as expected in a
simple mean-field SDW picture [27, 28, 29]. Previously, clear evidence
for incommensurability has only been reported in electron doped
BaFe₂As₂[30, 31, 32]. Since we do not observe a splitting of the
T_(s, N) line into two transitions above

respectively. (b) Electronic phase diagram of Ba_(1 − x)Na_(x)Fe₂As₂
obtained from thermal-expansion (squares) and specific-heat (circles)
data revealing nine different phases (see text for details). (d) Phase
diagram of Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ from Ref. [10] for comparison. The
kinks in (a) and (c), as well as the inflection points of T_(s, N) in
(b) and (d), near x = 0.22–0.23 are interpreted as marking a possible
transition from a commensurate (C₂-C) phase to an incommensurate (C₂-IC)
phase. This transition is indicated by the vertical dashed lines and the
color transition of the T_(s, N) line from blue to red. “S” stands for
superconductivity.

x = 0.22, we postulate the vertical dashed line to indicate the proposed
commensurate-to-incommensurate transition. Such a vertical line implies
a first-order transition, evidence of which is provided by the jumps of
both T₁ and T_(c) at x = 0.22. In Figs. 3(c) and 3(d) we compare the
present results to those of K-doped BaFe₂As₂[10]. Similar to the
Na-doped system, we also find an inflection point in its phase diagram
[see Fig. 3(d)], as well as a kink in the T = 0 orthorhombic distortion
[see Fig. 3(c)], at a K content at which the C₄ phase emerges [see Figs.
3(c) and 3(d)]. This strongly suggests that these are both common
features in hole doped BaFe₂As₂. In Ba_(1 − x)Na_(x)Fe₂As₂ we observe,
in addition to the magnetic C₄ phase, a previously unobserved phase
[labeled C₂^(′) in Fig. 3(b)], which has a reduced, but finite,
orthorhombic distortion. A similar phase in not observed in the K-doped
system. Although we cannot examine the microscopic order in this phase
using our macroscopic probes, the smooth doping variations of both
T_(s, N) and δ, suggest that this phase is probably also of magnetic
origin, although some kind of charge [14] order cannot be excluded.
Preliminary μSR measurements on a crystal with x = 0.33 provide evidence
for a magnetic C₂^(′) phase [33]. Detailed investigations of the
magnetic structure using, e.g., neutron scattering are highly desirable
once large enough crystals become available.

In order to gain more insight into the different phases, we present the
electronic heat capacity for several Na concentrations in Fig. 4
together with thermal expansion of the a axis for comparison. As
demonstrated in Figs. 3 and 4, the transition temperatures from the heat
capacity (solid gray circles in Fig. 3) closely match those from the
thermal expansion. With increasing Na doping, the steplike anomalies in
C_(c)/T associated with superconductivity generally increase in size,
whereas the anomalies associated with the magnetic transitions weaken,
indicating the well-known competition between magnetism and
superconductivity in the Fe-based systems [10, 24, 25, 26]. This trend
is made even more transparent in Figs. 4(k)-4(o), where we plot
S_(c)/T = (∫C_(c)/T dT)/T, i.e., the electronic entropy divided by T,
which for a Fermi liquid is expected to be constant. Upon entering the
C₄ phase at 45 K for the x = 0.265 Na sample we observe a particularly
large additional reduction of S_(c)/T at T₁, which is more prominent
than the anomaly at T_(s, N), and apparently results in a large
suppression of T_(c) and the condensation energy [equal to the black
shaded area in Figs. 4(k)-4(o)] in the C₄ phase. This highlights the
much stronger competition of superconductivity with the double-QC₄
magnetic phase than with the usual magnetic C₂ phase, which was also
observed in Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂[10]. However, in contrast to
Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂[10], we find no evidence for a reemergence of the
usual stripe-type C₂ phase below T_(c). For the crystals with x = 0.296
and 0.302, the largest (non superconducting) anomalies in C_(c)/T and
S_(c)/T occur not at T₁, but rather upon entering the C₄ phase at T₂.
Interestingly, the

Figure 4: (a)–(o) Temperature dependence of thermal expansion (α_(o)/T)
[(a)–(e)], electronic heat capacity (C_(c)/T) [(f)–(j)], and electronic
entropy (S_(c)/T) [(k)–(o)] for crystals with x = 0.182, 0.265, 0.296,
0.302, and 0.401. The different shades of gray represent the stepwise
reduction of S_(c)/T from the high temperature paramagnetic phase to the
low temperature superconducting state.

S_(c)/T plot for both these samples [Figs. 4(m) and 4(n)] provide
evidence for a pseudogap-like behavior above T₂; i.e., a gradual loss of
density of states as the temperature is lowered. The competition of
superconductivity with the C₂^(′) phase appears to be much weaker than
with the C₄-magnetic phase, as evidenced by the increase of the
superconducting condensation energy, as well as the rise of T_(c) seen
in Fig. 3 within the C₂^(′) phase. Finally, we note that the negligible
residual C_(e)/T values of all of our samples (except for x = 0.265)
demonstrate that our samples are of high quality and that doping away
from the FeAs layer does not introduce pair breaking, as it does in
Co-doped BaFe₂As₂[34].

In summary, our detailed thermodynamic studies of Ba_(1 − x)Na_(x)Fe₂As₂
show that the phase diagram of this system exhibits a surprising degree
of complexity. As stripe-type magnetism is suppressed by Na-doping, two
additional magnetic phases emerge, which coexist and compete with
superconductivity. The emergence of these additional phases is shown to
be possibly triggered by a doping-induced commensurate-incommensurate
transition near x = 0.22, which would provide further evidence for
electronic itinerancy in these systems. There are many similarities
between the phase diagrams of K- and Na-doped BaFe₂As₂, and the
differences are likely related to chemical pressure. Our previous
studies on the K-doped system have shown that the phase boundaries are
extremely pressure dependent [10], which has recently been confirmed by
direct pressure experiments [35]. Importantly, the presently observed
complexity of these phase diagram suggests a high degree of degeneracy
of several energy scales as the optimally doped state is approached,
which may also be related to the superconducting pairing mechanism.
