###### Abstract

The thermal expansion of air-sensitive A3 C60 compounds (_A_ = K,Rb) was investigated using a high-resolution capacitance dilatometer operating in an inner atmosphere. The discontinuity in the linear thermal expansivity at the superconducting transition, _D_a, of each compound is presented, from which we determine the corresponding discontinuity in the specific heat D_c_p_/_T__c_, via the Ehrenfest relation (75 +- 14 mJ/mol K2 for Rb3C60 and 64 +- 14 mJ/mol K2 for K3C60). On the basis of the calculated D_c_p_/_T__c_ values, the density of states _N_(E_{F}) and the electron-phonon coupling constant l are derived using the McMillan strong-coupling formalism and recent theoretical results. We find _N_(E_{F}) = 6.6 +- 1.1 states/eV spin C60 and 7.4 +- 1.0 states/eV spin C60 for K3C60 and Rb3C60, respectively. The associated l is estimated to be ~0.5 for both K3C60 and Rb3C60. The ratio _N_(E_{F})Rb3C60/_N_(E_{F})K3C60 is consistent with a superconducting mechanism involving high-frequency intramolecular phonons. [S0163-1829(96)50534-5]

Extensive experimental and theoretical investigations of superconductivity in alkali-metal-intercalated fullerenes with transition temperatures T_{c} up to 33 K (Ref. 1) support strongly a superconducting mechanism on the basis of a phonon-mediated electron-electron interaction.2 The exceptionally high T_{c} values (for electron-phonon coupling) have been rationalized on the basis of two unusual properties of doped C60. First, because of the strong covalent bonding within a C60 molecule, there are high-energetic intramolecular vibrations giving a high associated frequency o_{D} for these phonons.3 Second, the large intermolecular distance of adjacent C60-ions results in narrow electronic conduction bands and a correspondingly high density of states _N_(E_{F}) at the Fermi level.4 These large _N_(E_{F}) and o_{D} can account quantitatively for the high T_{c} values within a strong-coupling modified BCS theory5 with a McMillan parameter l of about 0.5-1.0 (Ref. 6). Whereas many experimental results, e.g., pressure studies,7 are consistent with the above scenario, there is still currently a wide variation in both experimentally and theoretically derived values for _N_(E_{F}) and l,8 and more experiments on well-characterized samples are needed. An investigation of the specific heat jump at the superconducting transition can make a valuable contribution in determining these quantities. Surprisingly, up to now only one investigation of the specific heat of fullerides has been published, performed for K3C60 by Ramirez _et al.9_ This is most likely caused by the extreme reactivity of the fullerides to air, which makes an encapsulation of the sample mandatory thereby complicating significantly the experiment.

In this paper we present high-resolution thermal expansion data of both K3C60 and Rb3C60, from which we determine the specific heat anomalies at T_{c} using the Ehrenfest relationship

\[\frac{dT_{c}}{dp} = 3\,V_{mol}T_{c}\frac{\Delta\alpha}{\Delta c_{p}}.\]

This thermodynamic relation correlates the jump in the thermal expansivity at the superconducting transition, D_a_(T_{c}), with the jump in the specific heat at T_{c},D_c_p_(T_{c}), and the pressure dependence of T_{c},_dT__c_/_dp_, the latter of which has been measured.7 We show that the derived D_c_p_/_T__c_ value for K3C60 is in excellent agreement with the direct specific heat measurement,9 and that the ratio of the specific heat anomalies of K3C60 and Rb3C60 is consistent with a coupling mechanism involving intramolecular phonons. On the other hand, the _N_(E_{F}) values derived from our data lie at the bottom of the range of theoretically derived _N_(E_{F})'s.6

The thermal expansion of the fullerides was investigated using a high-resolution parallel-plate capacitance dilatometer with a resolution of D_L_~0.05 A . Because of the fullerides extreme sensitivity to air, the preparation, the characterization as well as the measurements of the thermal expansion have to be performed in an inert gas atmosphere. For this purpose, a dilatometer cell was designed, in which the samples can be mounted directly in an argon atmosphere glove box (O3<1 ppm; H2O<0.1 ppm). After transfer of the dilatometer cell to the cryostat, the argon atmosphere in the cell is exchanged by a helium atmosphere to ensure thermal contact during the dilatation measurements.

To prepare K3C60 and Rb3C60 powder samples, stoichiometric quantities of (two times) sublimed C60 powder and alkali metal were sealed in quartz ampoules, reacted at 350 degC for several days, pelletized (3-5 mm height, 3 mm diameter) and again tempered at 350 degC for several days. Afterwards the samples were characterized by both powder x-ray diffraction (Cu-_K_a_) and by magnetization measurements (SQUID). A second characterization was performed for several samples after dilatometry to test the working of the inert gas handling system of the new device.

Figure 1(a) shows the powder diffraction data for a freshly prepared K3C60 sample. Also plotted is a Rietveld refinement of the data, which gives no indication of any impurity phase at the 5-10 % level. However, as will be shown later, the thermal expansion measurements demonstrate clearly that this sample is two-phased, with about 7% _a_-C60 (see below and Fig. 3). In Fig. 1(b) the powder diffraction pattern of a Rb3C60 sample is shown, which was made after dilatometer measurements in order to verify the stability of these extremely air-sensitive samples during the experimental investigation. This diffraction pattern shows little difference from the pattern of a freshly prepared sample (not shown), except for the appearance of several small additional peaks (marked by arrows). These additional peaks are related to the hydroxidemonohydrate compound Rb(H2O)OH, indicating a degradation of the sample most likely on a 5% level caused by a chemical reaction of rubidium with residual water vapor in the "inert" gas atmosphere (argon and helium).

Figure 1(c) shows a calculated diffraction pattern of Rb(H2O)OH based on a structure proposal by Jacobs _et al._[10] This reaction is different from the reaction of alkali-metal intercalated fullerenes with pure oxygen, identified by Snyder _et al._, [11] and was studied in more detail in a Rb6C60 sample. [12]

The magnetization of the K3C60 and Rb3C60 samples was measured with a self-constructed SQUID magnetometer, which is shielded magnetically by \mu metal allowing low-field measurements (the residual earth magnetic field strength is less than 2\times10^{-3} Oe). The magnetometer was calibrated using Pb samples of the same geometry as the fulleride samples. The measurements shown in Fig. 2 are performed at a magnetic field strength of H=1.3 Oe (Rb3C60) and H=0.6 Oe (K3C60). Fairly sharp superconducting transitions with onset temperatures of 20 and 30.5 K are observed for K3C60 and Rb3C60, respectively. The low-temperature susceptibility observed in the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) mode yields complete shielding for both samples within the error of the measurements (K3C60: \chi_{\rm ZFC}\sim 0.99; Rb3C60: \chi_{\rm ZFC}\sim 0.97). In contrast the Meissner effect, i.e., field-cooled (FC) mode, is smaller than 10% [K3C60: \chi_{\rm FC}\sim 0.08(\pm 0.02); Rb3C60: \chi_{\rm FC}\sim 0.07(\pm 0.01)]. Furthermore, a kink in the susceptibility is observed below T_{c} for both the ZFC and the FC data, which is attributed to intergranular shielding. [13] The above behavior is typical for a polycrystalline type-II superconductor [14] and indicates that the majority phase is the A3C60 superconducting phase in agreement with our x-ray results. Low Meissner fractions are often observed in type-II superconductors with flux pinning [15] and do not imply necessarily a low superconducting fraction. On the other hand, these types of measurements do not allow an unambiguous determination of the superconducting volume fraction.

It is important to note that the fraction of the superconducting phase A_{3}C60 is correlated directly with the jump height in the thermal expansivity at the superconducting transition temperature, and thus, it is essential to analyze accurately the phase composition of the samples. Within the resolution of the just discussed characterization techniques,

Figure 3: Linear thermal expansivity of K3C60 and Rb3C60. The anomaly in the thermal expansivity of the K3C60 sample near T^{\star}\sim242 K is related to the orientational order-disorder transition of a small amount of \alpha-C60 (see text for details).

  the A_{3}C_{60} phase is the majority phase with a fraction of more than 90%. For the following interpretation of the thermal expansion measurements the samples are assumed to be single phase A_{3}C_{60} samples and, therefore, the estimated values for \Delta\alpha(T_{c}) and \Deltac_{p}(T_{c}) are _lower_ limits.

The linear thermal expansivity \alpha(T) of the K_{3}C_{60} and Rb_{3}C_{60} samples is shown in Fig. 3 in the temperature range 10-290 K. A pronounced anomaly is seen in the thermal expansivity of the K_{3}C_{60} sample at T^{\ast}\sim 242 K, which we attribute to the orientational order-disorder transition of a small amount of \alpha-C_{60} phase in this sample. The existence of \alpha-C_{60} is consistent with the phase diagram [16] and suggests that the overall K stoichiometry of the sample is slightly below 3. Using the relative change in length caused by the order-disorder transition in pristine C_{60} (Ref. 17), an impurity of about 7% \alpha-C_{60} is estimated for the present K_{3}C_{60} sample. It is interesting to note that the ordering transition in \alpha-C_{60} is depressed by about 19 K from that in pristine C_{60} (Refs. 17,18). This is most likely caused by a kind of "negative chemical pressure" because of intercalation with potassium atoms, which increases the intermolecular separation. This interpretation is in accord with experiments on the hydrostatic pressure dependence of T^{\ast} in pristine C_{60}, where the orientational order-disorder transition is shifted to higher temperatures while the pressure is raised.[19] We never observed any anomalies in the Rb-doped samples near 250 K. This is consistent with the different phase diagram of Rb-doped C_{60}, in which the RbC_{60} phase, unlike the metastable KC_{60}, does not phase separate into the respective \alpha-C_{60} and A_{3}C_{60} phases.[16] Except for the \alpha-C_{60} induced anomaly, the shapes of the thermal expansivities of K_{3}C_{60} and Rb_{3}C_{60} are quite similar over the complete temperature range; the values for Rb_{3}C_{60} are about 10% larger than the ones for K_{3}C_{60}. The thermal expansivities at room temperature, \sim28\times10^{-6} 1/K (K_{3}C_{60}) and \sim29\times10^{-6} 1/K (Rb_{3}C_{60}), are quite large and the value for Rb_{3}C_{60} agrees well with the one obtained by Zhou _et al.[20]_ using x-ray diffraction between room temperature and 400 ^{\circ}C (30.5\times10^{-6} 1/K). It should be noted that the expansivities of the A_{3}C_{60} phases are surprisingly large. In comparison, the expansivity of pristine C_{60} at room temperature is only about one half as large[17] (\alpha_{{\rm C}_{60}}/\alpha_{{\rm Rb}_{3}{\rm C}_{60}}\sim 16\times10^{-6} K^{-1}/30\times10^{-6} K^{-1}= 0.53) as that of the A_{3}C_{60} compounds, even so the intermolecular potential is softer for pristine C_{60} as implied by the compressibilities \kappa (\kappa_{{\rm C}_{60}}/\kappa_{{\rm Rb}_{3}{\rm C}_{60}}\sim20.5 GPa/13.4 GPa= 1.53) (Refs. 19,21). This may be an indication for extremely anharmonic inter;actions between the alkali metal and the C_{60} molecules.

An interesting consequence of the large thermal expansion (the change in volume \DeltaV/V is about 2% in the range 10-290 K) is that the density of states at the Fermi level N(E_{F}), which is correlated with the lattice parameter a (Refs. 22,23), will have a significant temperature dependence. Using the N(E_{F}) vs a dependence from Tanigaki _et al.[22]_ (for intramolecular phonons), we calculate a decrease of N(E_{F}) caused by thermal contraction from room temperature to T_{c} of about 6% and 8% for Rb_{3}C_{60} and K_{3}C_{60}, respectively. This correction also is considered in electronic band structure calculations, which predicts a 15% reduction of the density of states N(E_{F}) for K_{3}C_{60} in the temperature range 10-300 K (Ref. 23) (regarding a contraction \Deltaa\sim 6- 7\times 10^{-3} of the lattice parameter).

In Fig. 4 the thermal expansivity of K_{3}C_{60} and Rb_{3}C_{60} is shown in the vicinity of T_{c} in a \alpha/T vs T plot. Clear anomalies in \alpha are seen at the respective critical temperatures of both K_{3}C_{60} and Rb_{3}C_{60}. The solid lines represent the idealized discontinuities expected for a second-order phase transition and were used to determine the \Delta\alpha values \Delta\alpha(T_{c}) = \alpha_{S}-\alpha_{N} = -(5.4\pm 0.9)\times10^{-7} 1/K for Rb_{3}C_{60} and \Delta\alpha(T_{c}) = -(3.8\pm 0.8)\times10^{-7} 1/K for K_{3}C_{60}. Incorporating these \Delta\alpha(T_{c}) and the dT_{c}/dp values from Sparn _et al.[7]_ the Ehrenstein relation yields \Deltac_{p}/T_{c} values of 75\pm 14 mJ/mol K^{2} and 64\pm 14 mJ/mol K^{2} for Rb_{3}C_{60} and K_{3}C_{60}, respectively. For K_{3}C_{60} this \Deltac_{p}/T_{c} value agrees very well with the one obtained directly from specific heat measurements[9] (\Deltac_{p}/T_{c} = 68\pm 13 mJ/mol K^{2}), verifying the present approach.

In the following, we discuss our results within the strong-coupling modified BCS theory. Our discussion differs from that of Ramirez _et al.[9]_, who for K_{3}C_{60} obtained very similar experimental results, in that we make use of a recent theoretical result which relates directly the McMillan parameter \lambda with N(E_{F}) (Ref. 6) and which, thus, allows a direct consistency check between experiment and theory. \Deltac_{p}/T_{c} is related directly to microscopic parameters within the BCS theory of superconductivity.

\[\frac{\Deltac_{p}}{T_{c}}\approx 1.43\gamma=1.43\frac{2}{3}\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}N(E_{F}).\] (2)

For a strong electron-phonon interaction, Eq. (2) is modified by the McMillan-parameter \lambda (Ref. 24)

\[\frac{\Deltac_{p}}{T_{c}}\approx\frac{2}{3}\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}N(E_{F})(1+\lambda)[ 1.43+O(\lambda^{2})].\] (3)

Figure 4: Thermal expansivity \alpha/T of K_{3}C_{60} and Rb_{3}C_{60} in the vicinity of the superconducting transition. The solid lines show a fit to an idealized discontinuity used to analyze the jump height. Discontinuities in the thermal expansivity, as expected for a second-order phase transition to superconductivity, are seen for Rb_{3}C_{60} at T_{c}\sim 29 K and for K_{3}C_{60} at T_{c}\sim 19 K.

  Thus, \Delta c_{P}/T_{c} depends on both the density of states N(E_{F}) and the McMillan parameter \lambda. Recent detailed _ab initio_ calculations of the electron-phonon coupling strength (only intramolecular phonons are considered) give \lambda = 0.068N(E_{F}).[6] This explicit relation allows us to extract both N(E_{F}) and \lambda from our derived \Delta c_{P}/T_{c} values using Eq. (3). Within this framework N(E_{F}) is equal to 7.4\pm 1.0 states/eV spin C 60 and 6.6\pm 1.1 states/eV spin C 60, for Rb 3C 60 and K 3C 60, respectively. Associated \lambda values are 0.50\pm 0.07 (Rb 3C 60) and 0.45\pm 0.07 (K3C 60).

As has been discussed by Antropov _et al._,[6] there exists a large uncertainty in theoretically derived N(E_{F}) values, where N(E_{F}) was estimated to fall in the ranges 6.7-8.6 states/eV spin C 60 and 7.5-10 states/eV spin C 60 for K 3C 60 and Rb 3C 60, respectively. Our currently derived values lie at the bottom end of this range and are about a factor of 1.5-3 smaller than N(E_{F}) values estimated from other experiments (see Ref. 2, p. 62). Recent modeling of the photoemission spectra of C 60 (Ref. 25) indicate that the electron phonon coupling may even be stronger [\lambda = 0.147 N(E_{F})] than calculated by Antropov _et al.[6]_ In this case we determine even smaller N(E_{F}) values from our data [N(E_{F}) = 5.3 states/eV spin C 60 and N(E_{F}) = 5.9 states/eV spin C 60 for Rb 3C 60] and \lambda increases from \sim 0.5 to \sim 0.8. At this stage it is unclear whether the above discrepancies represent fundamental problems or whether they are caused by uncertainties in the calculations. Gunnarsson _et al.[25]_ point out that small errors in the phonon eigenvectors can have a large effect on the electron-phonon coupling strength. Further, the calculated N(E_{F}) values depend strongly on the underlying orientational ordering of the C 60 molecules in the A_{3}C 60 phases and idealized structures have been used in the calculations,[6] whereas the x-ray diffraction experiments have been interpreted in terms of random disorder.[26]

Since K 3C 60 and Rb 3C 60 are isostructural, important information can be obtained by a comparison of their respective density of states. The ratio \epsilon = N(E_{F})_{\rm Rb_{2}C_{60}}/N(E_{F})_{\rm K_{3}C_{60}} (and the ratio of the associated \lambda's) depends strongly on the frequency of the phonons involved in the pairing mechanism,[27] and the ratio found from the present work, \epsilon = 1.13\pm 0.24, supports the scenario that the electrons are coupling to high-frequency intramolecular phonons (\epsilon\sim 1.69 is expected for low-frequency intermolecular phonon coupling[22]). This is in agreement with the experimental results of Sparn _et al._[7] (\epsilon = 1.11-1.24) and also with theoretically derived values for N(E_{F}) using electronic band structure calculations, which give \epsilon\sim 1.18 (Ref. 27).

In conclusion, thermal expansion data of the superconducting fullerides K 3C 60 and Rb 3C 60, obtained via high-resolution dilatometry, provide important information for analyzing the superconducting state. The ratio of the specific heat discontinuities \Delta c_{P}(T_{c}) at T_{c}, derived from these data using the Ehrenfest relation (and thus the ratio of the calculated N(E_{F}) values), favor a pairing mechanism in which high-frequency intramolecular phonons are involved. The densities of states N(E_{F}) obtained from the present analysis are smaller than the ones found by numerous experimental estimates and are lying at the bottom end of the range of theoretically calculated values.

###### Abstract

The thermal expansion of air-sensitive A3 C60 compounds (_A_ = K,Rb) was investigated using a high-resolution capacitance dilatometer operating in an inner atmosphere. The discontinuity in the linear thermal expansivity at the superconducting transition, _D_a, of each compound is presented, from which we determine the corresponding discontinuity in the specific heat D_c_p_/_T__c_, via the Ehrenfest relation (75 +- 14 mJ/mol K2 for Rb3C60 and 64 +- 14 mJ/mol K2 for K3C60). On the basis of the calculated D_c_p_/_T__c_ values, the density of states _N_(E_{F}) and the electron-phonon coupling constant l are derived using the McMillan strong-coupling formalism and recent theoretical results. We find _N_(E_{F}) = 6.6 +- 1.1 states/eV spin C60 and 7.4 +- 1.0 states/eV spin C60 for K3C60 and Rb3C60, respectively. The associated l is estimated to be ~0.5 for both K3C60 and Rb3C60. The ratio _N_(E_{F})Rb3C60/_N_(E_{F})K3C60 is consistent with a superconducting mechanism involving high-frequency intramolecular phonons. [S0163-1829(96)50534-5]

Extensive experimental and theoretical investigations of superconductivity in alkali-metal-intercalated fullerenes with transition temperatures T_{c} up to 33 K (Ref. 1) support strongly a superconducting mechanism on the basis of a phonon-mediated electron-electron interaction.2 The exceptionally high T_{c} values (for electron-phonon coupling) have been rationalized on the basis of two unusual properties of doped C60. First, because of the strong covalent bonding within a C60 molecule, there are high-energetic intramolecular vibrations giving a high associated frequency o_{D} for these phonons.3 Second, the large intermolecular distance of adjacent C60-ions results in narrow electronic conduction bands and a correspondingly high density of states _N_(E_{F}) at the Fermi level.4 These large _N_(E_{F}) and o_{D} can account quantitatively for the high T_{c} values within a strong-coupling modified BCS theory5 with a McMillan parameter l of about 0.5-1.0 (Ref. 6). Whereas many experimental results, e.g., pressure studies,7 are consistent with the above scenario, there is still currently a wide variation in both experimentally and theoretically derived values for _N_(E_{F}) and l,8 and more experiments on well-characterized samples are needed. An investigation of the specific heat jump at the superconducting transition can make a valuable contribution in determining these quantities. Surprisingly, up to now only one investigation of the specific heat of fullerides has been published, performed for K3C60 by Ramirez _et al.9_ This is most likely caused by the extreme reactivity of the fullerides to air, which makes an encapsulation of the sample mandatory thereby complicating significantly the experiment.

In this paper we present high-resolution thermal expansion data of both K3C60 and Rb3C60, from which we determine the specific heat anomalies at T_{c} using the Ehrenfest relationship

\[\frac{dT_{c}}{dp} = 3\,V_{mol}T_{c}\frac{\Delta\alpha}{\Delta c_{p}}.\]

This thermodynamic relation correlates the jump in the thermal expansivity at the superconducting transition, D_a_(T_{c}), with the jump in the specific heat at T_{c},D_c_p_(T_{c}), and the pressure dependence of T_{c},_dT__c_/_dp_, the latter of which has been measured.7 We show that the derived D_c_p_/_T__c_ value for K3C60 is in excellent agreement with the direct specific heat measurement,9 and that the ratio of the specific heat anomalies of K3C60 and Rb3C60 is consistent with a coupling mechanism involving intramolecular phonons. On the other hand, the _N_(E_{F}) values derived from our data lie at the bottom of the range of theoretically derived _N_(E_{F})'s.6

The thermal expansion of the fullerides was investigated using a high-resolution parallel-plate capacitance dilatometer with a resolution of D_L_~0.05 A . Because of the fullerides extreme sensitivity to air, the preparation, the characterization as well as the measurements of the thermal expansion have to be performed in an inert gas atmosphere. For this purpose, a dilatometer cell was designed, in which the samples can be mounted directly in an argon atmosphere glove box (O3<1 ppm; H2O<0.1 ppm). After transfer of the dilatometer cell to the cryostat, the argon atmosphere in the cell is exchanged by a helium atmosphere to ensure thermal contact during the dilatation measurements.

To prepare K3C60 and Rb3C60 powder samples, stoichiometric quantities of (two times) sublimed C60 powder and alkali metal were sealed in quartz ampoules, reacted at 350 degC for several days, pelletized (3-5 mm height, 3 mm diameter) and again tempered at 350 degC for several days. Afterwards the samples were characterized by both powder x-ray diffraction (Cu-_K_a_) and by magnetization measurements (SQUID). A second characterization was performed for several samples after dilatometry to test the working of the inert gas handling system of the new device.

Figure 1(a) shows the powder diffraction data for a freshly prepared K3C60 sample. Also plotted is a Rietveld refinement of the data, which gives no indication of any impurity phase at the 5-10 % level. However, as will be shown later, the thermal expansion measurements demonstrate clearly that this sample is two-phased, with about 7% _a_-C60 (see below and Fig. 3). In Fig. 1(b) the powder diffraction pattern of a Rb3C60 sample is shown, which was made after dilatometer measurements in order to verify the stability of these extremely air-sensitive samples during the experimental investigation. This diffraction pattern shows little difference from the pattern of a freshly prepared sample (not shown), except for the appearance of several small additional peaks (marked by arrows). These additional peaks are related to the hydroxidemonohydrate compound Rb(H2O)OH, indicating a degradation of the sample most likely on a 5% level caused by a chemical reaction of rubidium with residual water vapor in the "inert" gas atmosphere (argon and helium).

Figure 1(c) shows a calculated diffraction pattern of Rb(H2O)OH based on a structure proposal by Jacobs _et al._[10] This reaction is different from the reaction of alkali-metal intercalated fullerenes with pure oxygen, identified by Snyder _et al._, [11] and was studied in more detail in a Rb6C60 sample. [12]

The magnetization of the K3C60 and Rb3C60 samples was measured with a self-constructed SQUID magnetometer, which is shielded magnetically by \mu metal allowing low-field measurements (the residual earth magnetic field strength is less than 2\times10^{-3} Oe). The magnetometer was calibrated using Pb samples of the same geometry as the fulleride samples. The measurements shown in Fig. 2 are performed at a magnetic field strength of H=1.3 Oe (Rb3C60) and H=0.6 Oe (K3C60). Fairly sharp superconducting transitions with onset temperatures of 20 and 30.5 K are observed for K3C60 and Rb3C60, respectively. The low-temperature susceptibility observed in the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) mode yields complete shielding for both samples within the error of the measurements (K3C60: \chi_{\rm ZFC}\sim 0.99; Rb3C60: \chi_{\rm ZFC}\sim 0.97). In contrast the Meissner effect, i.e., field-cooled (FC) mode, is smaller than 10% [K3C60: \chi_{\rm FC}\sim 0.08(\pm 0.02); Rb3C60: \chi_{\rm FC}\sim 0.07(\pm 0.01)]. Furthermore, a kink in the susceptibility is observed below T_{c} for both the ZFC and the FC data, which is attributed to intergranular shielding. [13] The above behavior is typical for a polycrystalline type-II superconductor [14] and indicates that the majority phase is the A3C60 superconducting phase in agreement with our x-ray results. Low Meissner fractions are often observed in type-II superconductors with flux pinning [15] and do not imply necessarily a low superconducting fraction. On the other hand, these types of measurements do not allow an unambiguous determination of the superconducting volume fraction.

It is important to note that the fraction of the superconducting phase A_{3}C60 is correlated directly with the jump height in the thermal expansivity at the superconducting transition temperature, and thus, it is essential to analyze accurately the phase composition of the samples. Within the resolution of the just discussed characterization techniques,

Figure 3: Linear thermal expansivity of K3C60 and Rb3C60. The anomaly in the thermal expansivity of the K3C60 sample near T^{\star}\sim242 K is related to the orientational order-disorder transition of a small amount of \alpha-C60 (see text for details).

  the A_{3}C_{60} phase is the majority phase with a fraction of more than 90%. For the following interpretation of the thermal expansion measurements the samples are assumed to be single phase A_{3}C_{60} samples and, therefore, the estimated values for \Delta\alpha(T_{c}) and \Deltac_{p}(T_{c}) are _lower_ limits.

The linear thermal expansivity \alpha(T) of the K_{3}C_{60} and Rb_{3}C_{60} samples is shown in Fig. 3 in the temperature range 10-290 K. A pronounced anomaly is seen in the thermal expansivity of the K_{3}C_{60} sample at T^{\ast}\sim 242 K, which we attribute to the orientational order-disorder transition of a small amount of \alpha-C_{60} phase in this sample. The existence of \alpha-C_{60} is consistent with the phase diagram [16] and suggests that the overall K stoichiometry of the sample is slightly below 3. Using the relative change in length caused by the order-disorder transition in pristine C_{60} (Ref. 17), an impurity of about 7% \alpha-C_{60} is estimated for the present K_{3}C_{60} sample. It is interesting to note that the ordering transition in \alpha-C_{60} is depressed by about 19 K from that in pristine C_{60} (Refs. 17,18). This is most likely caused by a kind of "negative chemical pressure" because of intercalation with potassium atoms, which increases the intermolecular separation. This interpretation is in accord with experiments on the hydrostatic pressure dependence of T^{\ast} in pristine C_{60}, where the orientational order-disorder transition is shifted to higher temperatures while the pressure is raised.[19] We never observed any anomalies in the Rb-doped samples near 250 K. This is consistent with the different phase diagram of Rb-doped C_{60}, in which the RbC_{60} phase, unlike the metastable KC_{60}, does not phase separate into the respective \alpha-C_{60} and A_{3}C_{60} phases.[16] Except for the \alpha-C_{60} induced anomaly, the shapes of the thermal expansivities of K_{3}C_{60} and Rb_{3}C_{60} are quite similar over the complete temperature range; the values for Rb_{3}C_{60} are about 10% larger than the ones for K_{3}C_{60}. The thermal expansivities at room temperature, \sim28\times10^{-6} 1/K (K_{3}C_{60}) and \sim29\times10^{-6} 1/K (Rb_{3}C_{60}), are quite large and the value for Rb_{3}C_{60} agrees well with the one obtained by Zhou _et al.[20]_ using x-ray diffraction between room temperature and 400 ^{\circ}C (30.5\times10^{-6} 1/K). It should be noted that the expansivities of the A_{3}C_{60} phases are surprisingly large. In comparison, the expansivity of pristine C_{60} at room temperature is only about one half as large[17] (\alpha_{{\rm C}_{60}}/\alpha_{{\rm Rb}_{3}{\rm C}_{60}}\sim 16\times10^{-6} K^{-1}/30\times10^{-6} K^{-1}= 0.53) as that of the A_{3}C_{60} compounds, even so the intermolecular potential is softer for pristine C_{60} as implied by the compressibilities \kappa (\kappa_{{\rm C}_{60}}/\kappa_{{\rm Rb}_{3}{\rm C}_{60}}\sim20.5 GPa/13.4 GPa= 1.53) (Refs. 19,21). This may be an indication for extremely anharmonic inter;actions between the alkali metal and the C_{60} molecules.

An interesting consequence of the large thermal expansion (the change in volume \DeltaV/V is about 2% in the range 10-290 K) is that the density of states at the Fermi level N(E_{F}), which is correlated with the lattice parameter a (Refs. 22,23), will have a significant temperature dependence. Using the N(E_{F}) vs a dependence from Tanigaki _et al.[22]_ (for intramolecular phonons), we calculate a decrease of N(E_{F}) caused by thermal contraction from room temperature to T_{c} of about 6% and 8% for Rb_{3}C_{60} and K_{3}C_{60}, respectively. This correction also is considered in electronic band structure calculations, which predicts a 15% reduction of the density of states N(E_{F}) for K_{3}C_{60} in the temperature range 10-300 K (Ref. 23) (regarding a contraction \Deltaa\sim 6- 7\times 10^{-3} of the lattice parameter).

In Fig. 4 the thermal expansivity of K_{3}C_{60} and Rb_{3}C_{60} is shown in the vicinity of T_{c} in a \alpha/T vs T plot. Clear anomalies in \alpha are seen at the respective critical temperatures of both K_{3}C_{60} and Rb_{3}C_{60}. The solid lines represent the idealized discontinuities expected for a second-order phase transition and were used to determine the \Delta\alpha values \Delta\alpha(T_{c}) = \alpha_{S}-\alpha_{N} = -(5.4\pm 0.9)\times10^{-7} 1/K for Rb_{3}C_{60} and \Delta\alpha(T_{c}) = -(3.8\pm 0.8)\times10^{-7} 1/K for K_{3}C_{60}. Incorporating these \Delta\alpha(T_{c}) and the dT_{c}/dp values from Sparn _et al.[7]_ the Ehrenstein relation yields \Deltac_{p}/T_{c} values of 75\pm 14 mJ/mol K^{2} and 64\pm 14 mJ/mol K^{2} for Rb_{3}C_{60} and K_{3}C_{60}, respectively. For K_{3}C_{60} this \Deltac_{p}/T_{c} value agrees very well with the one obtained directly from specific heat measurements[9] (\Deltac_{p}/T_{c} = 68\pm 13 mJ/mol K^{2}), verifying the present approach.

In the following, we discuss our results within the strong-coupling modified BCS theory. Our discussion differs from that of Ramirez _et al.[9]_, who for K_{3}C_{60} obtained very similar experimental results, in that we make use of a recent theoretical result which relates directly the McMillan parameter \lambda with N(E_{F}) (Ref. 6) and which, thus, allows a direct consistency check between experiment and theory. \Deltac_{p}/T_{c} is related directly to microscopic parameters within the BCS theory of superconductivity.

\[\frac{\Deltac_{p}}{T_{c}}\approx 1.43\gamma=1.43\frac{2}{3}\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}N(E_{F}).\] (2)

For a strong electron-phonon interaction, Eq. (2) is modified by the McMillan-parameter \lambda (Ref. 24)

\[\frac{\Deltac_{p}}{T_{c}}\approx\frac{2}{3}\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}N(E_{F})(1+\lambda)[ 1.43+O(\lambda^{2})].\] (3)

Figure 4: Thermal expansivity \alpha/T of K_{3}C_{60} and Rb_{3}C_{60} in the vicinity of the superconducting transition. The solid lines show a fit to an idealized discontinuity used to analyze the jump height. Discontinuities in the thermal expansivity, as expected for a second-order phase transition to superconductivity, are seen for Rb_{3}C_{60} at T_{c}\sim 29 K and for K_{3}C_{60} at T_{c}\sim 19 K.

  Thus, \Delta c_{P}/T_{c} depends on both the density of states N(E_{F}) and the McMillan parameter \lambda. Recent detailed _ab initio_ calculations of the electron-phonon coupling strength (only intramolecular phonons are considered) give \lambda = 0.068N(E_{F}).[6] This explicit relation allows us to extract both N(E_{F}) and \lambda from our derived \Delta c_{P}/T_{c} values using Eq. (3). Within this framework N(E_{F}) is equal to 7.4\pm 1.0 states/eV spin C 60 and 6.6\pm 1.1 states/eV spin C 60, for Rb 3C 60 and K 3C 60, respectively. Associated \lambda values are 0.50\pm 0.07 (Rb 3C 60) and 0.45\pm 0.07 (K3C 60).

As has been discussed by Antropov _et al._,[6] there exists a large uncertainty in theoretically derived N(E_{F}) values, where N(E_{F}) was estimated to fall in the ranges 6.7-8.6 states/eV spin C 60 and 7.5-10 states/eV spin C 60 for K 3C 60 and Rb 3C 60, respectively. Our currently derived values lie at the bottom end of this range and are about a factor of 1.5-3 smaller than N(E_{F}) values estimated from other experiments (see Ref. 2, p. 62). Recent modeling of the photoemission spectra of C 60 (Ref. 25) indicate that the electron phonon coupling may even be stronger [\lambda = 0.147 N(E_{F})] than calculated by Antropov _et al.[6]_ In this case we determine even smaller N(E_{F}) values from our data [N(E_{F}) = 5.3 states/eV spin C 60 and N(E_{F}) = 5.9 states/eV spin C 60 for Rb 3C 60] and \lambda increases from \sim 0.5 to \sim 0.8. At this stage it is unclear whether the above discrepancies represent fundamental problems or whether they are caused by uncertainties in the calculations. Gunnarsson _et al.[25]_ point out that small errors in the phonon eigenvectors can have a large effect on the electron-phonon coupling strength. Further, the calculated N(E_{F}) values depend strongly on the underlying orientational ordering of the C 60 molecules in the A_{3}C 60 phases and idealized structures have been used in the calculations,[6] whereas the x-ray diffraction experiments have been interpreted in terms of random disorder.[26]

Since K 3C 60 and Rb 3C 60 are isostructural, important information can be obtained by a comparison of their respective density of states. The ratio \epsilon = N(E_{F})_{\rm Rb_{2}C_{60}}/N(E_{F})_{\rm K_{3}C_{60}} (and the ratio of the associated \lambda's) depends strongly on the frequency of the phonons involved in the pairing mechanism,[27] and the ratio found from the present work, \epsilon = 1.13\pm 0.24, supports the scenario that the electrons are coupling to high-frequency intramolecular phonons (\epsilon\sim 1.69 is expected for low-frequency intermolecular phonon coupling[22]). This is in agreement with the experimental results of Sparn _et al._[7] (\epsilon = 1.11-1.24) and also with theoretically derived values for N(E_{F}) using electronic band structure calculations, which give \epsilon\sim 1.18 (Ref. 27).

In conclusion, thermal expansion data of the superconducting fullerides K 3C 60 and Rb 3C 60, obtained via high-resolution dilatometry, provide important information for analyzing the superconducting state. The ratio of the specific heat discontinuities \Delta c_{P}(T_{c}) at T_{c}, derived from these data using the Ehrenfest relation (and thus the ratio of the calculated N(E_{F}) values), favor a pairing mechanism in which high-frequency intramolecular phonons are involved. The densities of states N(E_{F}) obtained from the present analysis are smaller than the ones found by numerous experimental estimates and are lying at the bottom end of the range of theoretically calculated values.
