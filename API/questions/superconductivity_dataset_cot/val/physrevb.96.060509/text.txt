###### Abstract

The evolution of electrical transport properties, the electronic band structure, and lattice dynamics of PdSe2 is studied under high pressure. The emergence of superconductivity is reported in the high-pressure pyrite-type phase of PdSe2. In this transition-metal dichalcogenide, the critical temperature of superconductivity rapidly increases with pressure up to 13.1 K. _Ab initio_ electronic band structure calculations indicate the presence of Dirac and nodal-line fermions in the vicinity of the Fermi energy protected by the pyrite structure symmetry, which can lead to interesting superconducting states. Raman spectroscopy shows a direct correlation between critical temperature and bonding strength of Se-Se dumbbells in PdSe2, underlining the crucial role of bonding for tuning the superconductivity.

The exploration of the chemical, structural, and electronic parameters of a solid which lead to the appearance or the enhancement of superconductivity is an ongoing topic of intensive research [1]. In transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), a class of compounds known for their unusual electronic properties and rich intercalation chemistry, superconductivity often competes with diverse exotic phases. In such strongly correlated materials, the crystal and electronic structures can be tuned in a wide range by chemical substitution or application of external pressure [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

Originating from the competition between cationic \(d\) orbitals and anionic _sp_ levels, TMDs form either two- (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) structures [7,8]. Layered quasi-2D TMDs often exhibit strongly competing effects of charge-density wave formation and superconductivity [2, 3, 4]. The nonlayered 3D TMDs with a pyrite structure are close to insulator-metal transition systems, with various magnetic and electrical phenomena ranging from the prototypical antiferromagnetic Mott insulator NiS2 to the superconducting copper dichalcogenides [9,10]. The characteristic of the pyrite structure is a strong pairing of the chalcogen atoms (_X_) forming (_X_-_X_)\({}^{- 2}\) dimers. The bond length in these dumbbells is considered as a key parameter controlling the critical temperature (_T_c) of superconductivity in the defective pyrite compounds Ir\({}_{x}\)Se2 and Ir\({}_{0.94-x}\)Rh\({}_{x}\)Se2 [5,6]. These materials, however, are affected by disorder due to nonstoichiometry and chemical substitution. In contrast, the application of external pressure is a "clean" tool to tune the interatomic distances.

Here, we study the interplay between the structure, bonding, and electronic properties in PdSe2, featuring a unique crystal structure on the borderline between 2D and 3D structures [7]. The structure of PdSe2 consists of 2D layers of square-planar coordinated Pd [Fig. 1(a)] due to the stabilization of the low-spin diamagnetic configuration of the Pd2+ cation [11]. This decrease in symmetry results in a splitting of the _e_g levels, so that the eight electrons of Pd2+ fill all available \(d\) levels through the lower _d_c; level. This configuration accounts for the diamagnetic semiconducting properties of PdSe2 at ambient conditions.

A single-crystalline PdSe2 sample was synthesized by the chemical vapor transport of polycrystalline PdSe2 with iodine as the transport agent. For high-pressure electrical resistivity and Raman spectroscopy measurements, a single crystal of \(\sim\)5 \(\mu\)m thickness was loaded in a diamond anvil cell with NaCl as the pressure transmitting medium. Further details of our high-pressure experimental technique are described elsewhere [12].

Theoretical calculations were performed within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the vasp program package [13] using the projected augmented wave method [14,15] with a plane-wave cutoff energy of 350 eV. For Brillouin zone integration, we use a (5 x 5 x 5) _k_-point mesh. The structural relaxation was performed until the maximum force on each atom is less than 0.05 eV/A. The pseudopotentials are chosen such that the 4\(p\) and 4\(d\) states of Pd and the 4\(s\) and 4\(p\) of Se are treated as valence states. To take into account the van der Waals forces, a set of calculations with different exchange-correlation functionals was performed with the best agreement between experiment and theory provided by the optPBE-vdW functional [16,17]. The Fermi surface is calculated by the wannier90 code [18].

Application of pressure systematically changes the transport properties of PdSe2 [Fig. 2(a)]. For pressures below 3 GPa, the temperature dependence of the resistivity \(\rho(T)\) shows a semiconducting behavior. The band structure calculation for PdSe2 at ambient pressure [Fig. 3(a)] reproduces the semiconducting properties with an indirect band gap of \(\sim\)0.25 eV. The room-temperature resistivity rapidly decreases as pressure increases, and \(\rho(T)\) above 3 GPa shows metallic behavior, indicating the metallic state in PdSe2. This is in reasonable agreement with the results of band structure calculations showing a band gap closure at about 2 GPa [Fig. 3(b)].

 The metallization occurs without a structural phase transition, as indicated by Raman spectroscopy data [Fig. 1(c)], proving the stability of the PdSe\({}_{2}\)-type structure up to pressures \(\approx\)6 GPa, in full agreement with the structural studies of PdSe\({}_{2}\)[19]. At a pressure of 6-10 GPa, PdSe\({}_{2}\) undergoes a structural phase transition to a pyrite-type structure [19], indicated by the change of Raman spectra [Fig. 1(c)]. Comparing the Raman spectra of the high-pressure phase of PdSe\({}_{2}\) at 9.2 GPa with those of NiSe\({}_{2}\)[20], the observed peaks can be well assigned to the \(E_{g}\) librational mode and \(A_{g}\) and \(T_{g}\) in-phase and out-of-phase stretching vibrations of the Se\({}_{2}\) dumbbells [Fig. 1(c)]. The \(E_{g}\) mode is largely governed by the Pd-Se force constant while the frequency of the \(A_{g}\) stretching reflects the strength of Se-Se dumbbell bonding.

The pyrite phase of PdSe\({}_{2}\) is clearly metallic [Fig. 2(a)], in agreement with its calculated band structure [Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)]. Two bands with mainly Se \(p\) and Pd \(d_{z^{1}-y^{2}}\) characters cross the Fermi energy (\(E_{\rm F}\)) close to \(\Gamma\) and \(X\) (\(M\)), respectively, and some other bands have their extrema close to \(E_{\rm F}\). With further increasing pressure, the latter band extrema move away from \(E_{\rm F}\) [Fig. 3(d)]. This change in the electronic structure causes only a small change in the density of state (DOS) at \(E_{\rm F}\) for different applied pressures [right panels in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)]. Without spin-orbit coupling (SOC), there are three nodal lines about 0.25 eV above \(E_{\rm F}\) in the \(k_{x}=0,k_{y}=0\), and \(k_{z}=0\) planes [Fig. 3(c)] allowed by the three mirror symmetries [\(M_{x}\)]\(\frac{1}{2}\)[\(\frac{1}{2}\)0], [\(M_{y}\)]\(0\frac{1}{2}\)[\(\frac{1}{2}\)], and [\(M_{z}\)]\(\frac{1}{2}\)[\(\frac{1}{2}\)0]\(\frac{1}{2}\)] that are characterized by an \(MZ\) invariant [21]. Upon inclusion of SOC, a gap of the order of 0.02 eV opens. There is an additional Dirac crossing along the \(\Gamma M\) direction at slightly higher energies which is unaffected by SOC [Fig. 3(e)]. The topological protection remains in the limit of small gap opening terms such as SOC, as it is the case in PdSe\({}_{2}\). Topological nontrivial bulk and surface states attracted much interest recently in context of their interplay with the superconducting instability [22, 23, 24]. Interestingly, we find an eightfold degeneracy at the \(M\) point at the Fermi level that splits into two fourfold degeneracies separated by \(\sim\)0.01 eV if SOC is included [Fig. 3(f)]. These higher-order degeneracies are stabilized by the presence of nonsymmorphic symmetries [25]. Conditioned by the nodal lines and the fourfold degeneracies, the Fermi surface of pyrite PdSe\({}_{2}\) consists of a large central pocket and a network connected along the edges of the Brillouin zone [Fig. 3(g)], and is similar to that of metallic NiS\({}_{2}\) just above its insulator-to-metal transition [26].

Most interestingly, at low temperatures a superconducting state emerges in pyrite PdSe\({}_{2}\). At a pressure of 7.2 GPa, a drop of the resistivity appears below a temperature of 2.4 K, suggesting the onset of a superconducting transition. The superconducting state is clearly observed at higher pressures with the resistivity dropping abruptly to zero. The critical

Figure 1: Crystal structures of PdSe\({}_{2}\). The ambient pressure PdS\({}_{2}\)-type structure (a) can be described as an elongated pyrite structure, which transforms under pressure (\(>\)6 GPa) to the pyrite-type structure [19] (b). The change in the Raman spectra between 5 and 9.2 GPa (c) indicates the structural transition to a pyrite-type structure. The mode assignment within the pyrite structure is shown on the spectrum at 9.2 GPa. Blue arrows schematically show the unusual evolution of the \(E_{g}\) libration and the \(A_{g}\) stretching vibrations of the Se\({}_{2}\) dumbbells with pressure. The pyrite phase of PdSe\({}_{2}\) is stable up to 37 GPa, above which the Raman spectrum changes (the green lines for 38.5 GPa show the deconvolution of the observed spectrum into two broad peaks), indicating a structural transition to a next high-pressure phase of PdSe\({}_{2}\) referred to as the \(\gamma\) phase.

(a) Application of pressure tunes the electronic properties of the PdS\({}_{2}\)-type phase of PdSe\({}_{2}\) from a semiconductor to a metal at pressures above 3 GPa. (b) With the transition to the pyrite phase, superconductivity emerges with \(T_{c}\) showing a dome-shaped dependence on pressure with a maximum \(T_{c}\) of 13.1 K at \(P\sim 23\) GPa. (c) Demonstration of the correlation between the pressure evolutions of \(T_{c}\) and frequencies of internal stretching vibration (\(A_{g}\) mode) and librational (\(E_{g}\) mode) modes of the Se\({}_{2}\) dumbbells. The sudden increase of the room-temperature resistivity at \(P=37\) GPa and the change of the temperature dependence \(\rho(T)\) in the normal state [a very weak temperature dependence, as illustrated by the curve at 40 GPa in (a)] indicates a structural transition to the \(\gamma\) phase. The \(\gamma\) phase remains superconducting [curve at 40 GPa in (a)] with \(T_{c}\) weakly depending on pressure.

The valence band maximum at the \(\Gamma\) point has Pd \(d_{z^{2}}\) character hybridized with the \(p_{x}\) state of Se. The conduction band minimum is between the \(S\) and \(Y\) high-symmetry points and consists of Pd \(d_{z^{2}-y^{2}}\) and Se \(p\) states. (b) At about 2 GPa the band structure shows the metallization of PdSe\({}_{2}\) with the PdS\({}_{2}\)-type structure. (c) The electronic structure of PdSe\({}_{2}\) in the pyrite phase with bands crossing the Fermi energy is very different from that of the PdS\({}_{2}\)-type structure. (d) A further increase of the pressure pushes the bands’ extrema away from the Fermi energy.

(g) The Fermi surface of the pyrite phase for the band structure (c). The network along the edges of the Brillouin zone (lower panel) is formed by small electron and hole pockets. At high pressure these bands move away from the \(E_{F}\) (d) and the Fermi surface will only contain the cubelike pockets.

  temperature \(T_{\rm c}\) increases rapidly, reaches a maximum of 13.1 K at \(\approx\)23 GPa, and then decreases continuously for higher pressures up to \(\approx\)37 GPa. The resistivity in the normal state shows a normal-metallic behavior upon heating up to room temperature at all pressures.

The Raman spectra of PdSe\({}_{2}\) in the pyrite phase display a remarkably nonmonotonous evolution of the frequencies of the librational \(E_{\rm g}\) and internal stretching \(A_{\rm g}\) modes with pressure [Fig. 1(c)]. Just after the transition to the pyrite phase, the frequency of the \(E_{\rm g}\) mode increases with pressure, consistent with a shortening of the Pd-Se distance under compression. Concomitantly, the stretching vibration softens considerably, indicating the weakening of the Se-dimer bond likely governed by electronic correlations [27]. Both frequencies reach their extrema at a pressure above \(\approx\)22 GPa and then display the opposite trend with further increasing pressure. Figure 2(c) shows a clear correlation between the pressure dependences of \(T_{\rm c}\) and the frequencies of the \(A_{\rm g}\) and \(E_{\rm g}\) modes which directly reflect the strengths of Se-Se and Pd-Se bonds in PdSe\({}_{2}\).

Quantitatively, the pressure effect on superconductivity may be expressed with the McMillan formula which connects \(T_{\rm c}\) with a characteristic phonon frequency \(\omega\), the electron-phonon coupling parameter \(\lambda=N(E_{\rm F})I^{2}/M\omega^{2}\) [where \(N(E_{\rm F})\) is the electronic DOS at \(E_{\rm F}\), \(I^{2}\) is the electron-ion matrix element, and \(M\) is the atomic mass], and the effective Coulomb repulsion \(\mu^{*}\)[28]. By taking its logarithmic volume derivative,

\[\frac{d\ln T_{\rm c}}{d\ln V}=-B\frac{d\ln T_{\rm c}}{d\,P}\cong(2\Delta-1) \gamma+\Delta\frac{d\ln\eta}{d\ln V},\] (1)

where \(B\) is the bulk modulus, \(\Delta=1.02\lambda[\lambda-\mu^{*}-\mu^{*}\lambda]^{-2}\), \(\gamma\equiv-d\ln\omega/d\ln V\) is the Gruneisen parameter, and \(\eta\equiv N(E_{\rm F})I^{2}\) is known as the Hopfield parameter [29, 30]. The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (1) expresses the effect of the change of the phonon frequency, whereas the second is an "electronic" term. Using the experimental data of the pressure dependence of \(T_{\rm c}\) and \(\omega\) in PdSe\({}_{2}\) and \(B=77.9\) GPa [19], it is evident that for any combination of \(\lambda\), and \(\mu^{*}\) in the relevant ranges (\(\lambda=0.1\)-\(2.0\) and \(\mu^{*}=0.0\)-\(2\)), the observed strong enhancement of \(T_{\rm c}\) (\(d\ln T_{\rm c}/d\,P\approx 25\%/\)GPa) cannot be explained by a softening of the \(A_{\rm g}\) phonon frequency (\(d\ln\omega/d\,P\approx-1.8\%/\)GPa) alone and the electronic term in Eq. (1) appears to be the dominant factor.

Interestingly, \(N(E_{\rm F})\) shows only a weak evolution with pressure [Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)] and cannot explain the strong increase of \(T_{\rm c}\). Within the McMillan formula, the remaining possibility is a significant enhancement of \(I^{2}\), which might be driven by a pressure effect on the ionic polarizability of the Se-Se dimer. Pyrite TMDs are known for large polarizabilities [e.g., for NiS\({}_{2}\), the dielectric constant \(\varepsilon_{\infty}\approx 26\), comparable with polarizabilities of organic superconductors (\(\varepsilon_{\infty}\approx 20\)) [31] and high-\(T_{\rm c}\) cuprates (\(\varepsilon_{\infty}\approx 50\)) [32], where dielectric properties play a significant role in the electron pairing [33, 34] which are caused by charge fluctuations due to the strong hybridization between the cation \(d\) states and the anion \(sp\sigma^{*}\) states near the Fermi level [35]. As a result, the ionic polarizability screens out the electronic polarizability for states close to \(E_{\rm F}\), greatly modifying the Coulomb repulsion \(\mu^{*}\), and \(I^{2}\) becomes very large for the screened states [36]. The gain in the intensity of the \(E_{\rm g}\) mode [Fig. 1(c)] in PdSe\({}_{2}\) with increasing pressure is probably induced by resonance effects. It might be indicative for an enhancement of the oscillator strength of the virtual Pd \(4d\)-Se \(4\,p\) transitions due to strengthening of the Pd-Se bonding and may cause an increase of the polarizability. Alternatively, the application of pressure increases the Se-Se distance \(R\) and consequently the ionic polarizability (\(\alpha\sim R^{2}\)) of the Se\({}_{2}\) dumbbell governing the strong enhancement of \(T_{\rm c}\). The dome-shaped dependence of \(T_{\rm c}\) on pressure is conditioned by the competition of pressure-induced band broadening favoring enhancement of hybridization of Pd \(d\)\(-\)Se\({}_{2}\)\(sp\sigma^{*}\) states, and the shift of the bands with an increasing difference between the bonding and antibonding states under compression [37], expelling at a certain pressure the antibonding \(sp\sigma^{*}\) states of Se\({}_{2}\) dimers above \(E_{\rm F}\) [Fig. 3(d)]. This leads to softening of Pd-Se and strengthening of Se-Se bonds, benchmarking the turning point of the pressure dependence of \(T_{\rm c}\).

In conclusion, the application of pressure leads to the emergence of superconductivity in the pyrite phase of PdSe\({}_{2}\), with \(T_{\rm c}\) rapidly increasing in correlation with a weakening of Se-Se bonds. This is due to a charge transfer from the metal atoms to the antibonding states of the Se\({}_{2}\) dumbbell effectively oxidizing the Pd (\(d^{8}\)) to a higher oxidation state (\(d^{8-4}\)). The large family of transition-metal compounds with the pyrite structure offers a wide range of possibilities for tuning the oxidation state of the metal atoms and bonding strength of the dumbbells by chemical substitution, opening the perspective to achieve higher values of \(T_{\rm c}\) and to eventually stabilize the superconducting state at ambient pressure. The presence of topological bands additionally allows probing the interplay between topological states and superconductivity, which can lead to different exotic superconducting states of matter in this crystal structure.
