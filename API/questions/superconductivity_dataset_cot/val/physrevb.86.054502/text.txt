###### Abstract

We report detailed magnetic, transport, and thermodynamic properties of metastable Rh3Bi14 single crystals in a superconducting and normal state. We show that Rh3Bi14 is a nearly isotropic, weakly to intermediately coupled BCS superconductor, whereas the electronic resistivity above superconducting \(T_{c}=2.94\) K is dominated by the phonon scattering in the large unit cell with pores filled by Bi atoms. Superconductivity is strongly influenced by the nature of atoms that fill the voids in the crystal structure.

## I Introduction

Complex crystal structures with atomic subunits often show significant electronic and magnetic tunability through incorporation of various elements in the (sub)structure. Examples include covalently bonded IV group thermoelectric clathrates that are under the influence of anharmonic lattice vibrations with electron-phonon coupling strength comparable to MgB2, alkali doped fullerenes, and magnetic molecules.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] Cluster units may substantially define physical properties, whereas their size may considerably deviate from the length scales defined by the lattice parameters, even in intermetallic systems where delocalized metallic bonds are present.[9]

A binary Rh-Bi intermetallic phase diagram has been studied for more than eight decades. Yet, a structurally complex metastable Rh3Bi14 with 136 atoms per unit cell has been discovered only in recent years.[10, 11, 12] The bismuth-rich side of this phase diagram also includes \(\alpha\)-RhBi2, \(\beta\)-RhBi2, RhBi3, and RhBi4 phases.[13, 14] According to the Rh-Bi phase diagram, Rh3Bi14 is a metastable phase hidden in the RhBi4-Bi solid phase region. Since the kinetic of peritectic reaction forming RhBi1 is extremely slow, it can be easily suppressed by undercooling due to nucleation problems.[11] Hence, Rh3Bi14 single crystals can be decanted from the Bi liquid, whereas the RhBi4 single crystals are difficult to obtain.

Rh3Bi14 has orthorhombic symmetry (\(Fddd\) space group) with \(a=0.69041(4)\) [0.68959(15)] nm, \(b=1.73816(9)\) [1.7379(3)] nm, and \(c=3.1752(2)\) [3.1758(6)] nm.[11, 12] In a Rh3Bi4 unit cell there are 24 Rh and 112 Bi atoms.[12] Each Rh atom is surrounded by eight Bi atoms, however there are two inequivalent Rh positions in the unit cell. Rh1 is cubically coordinated, whereas Rh2 exhibits a square antiprismatic coordination as shown in Fig. 1(a). Each [RhBi8/2] polyhedra shares a common edge with four other polyhedra, and thus creates a porous three-dimensional (3D) framework with channels along the [100] direction. In these channels there are chiral inner surfaces filled with bismuth ions [Fig. 1(b)]. Partial oxidation of RhBi4 using bromine results in Rh3Bi12Br2, isostructural with Rh3Bi14.[12] The difference between Rh3Bi14 and Rh3Bi12Br2 is in the atoms in the channels. In Rh3Bi14, Bi atoms fill the channels, whereas they are filled by Br atoms in Rh3Bi12Br2. The theoretical calculation indicates that the 3D polyhedral frameworks in Rh3Bi14 and Rh3Bi12Br2 are formed by covalently bonded rhodium and bismuth atoms, consistent with the results of high-pressure studies.[12] On the other hand, there are no direct bonds between this 3D polycation framework and anions (Bi\({}^{-1}\) or Br\({}^{-1}\) in the channels), which leads to the higher compressibility along the \(a\) axis when compared to those along the \(b\) and \(c\) axes mainly controlled by the covalently bonded polycation.[12]

Magnetization measurement indicates that Rh3Bi14 is a superconductor with \(T_{c}=2.82(5)\) K.[11] Although the crystal structure and chemical bonding have been studied,[11, 12, 15] the studies on physical properties, especially in connection with superconductivity, are still lacking.[11] In this work we report on detailed analysis of Rh3Bi14 physical properties in the superconducting and normal states. We show that electronic scattering in the normal state is dominated by phonons, whereas in its superconducting state Rh3Bi14 is an isotropic, weakly to intermediately coupled BCS superconductor.

## II Experiment

Single crystals of Rh3Bi14 were grown by the flux-growth method with a Rh:Bi = 5:95 molar ratio. Rh pieces (99.9%) and Bi shot (99.9%) were weighed, combined into an alumina crucible, covered with quartz wool, and sealed into the quartz tube with a partial pressure of argon. The quartz tube was heated to 1000 degC, held constant for 2 h, and then cooled at a rate of \(-3.5\) degC/h to 300 degC, where crystals were decanted. Single crystals with a typical size 0.5 x 0.2 x 0.2 mm3 were obtained. Crystal structure and phase purity were examined by powder and single crystal x-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) with Cu \(K_{\alpha}\) radiation (\(\lambda=0.15418\) nm) using a Rigaku Miniflex x-ray machine. The structure parameters are extracted by fitting the XRD spectra using the Reieta software.[16] The crystal was oriented using a Bruker SMART APEX II single crystal x-ray diffractometer. The composition of the Rh3Bi14 single crystal was determined by examination of multiple points on the crystals using energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) in an JEOL JSM-6500 scanning electron microscope. Electrical transport, heat capacity, and magnetization measurements were performed in a Quantum Design PPMS-9 and MPMS XL 5.

## III Results and Discussion

All powder x-ray reflections [Fig. 1(c)] can be indexed in the \(Fddd\) space group. The refined lattice parameters are \(a=0.6891(1)\) nm, \(b=1.7388(1)\) nm, and \(c=3.1718(2)\) nm with \(R_{p}=5.220\), \(R_{wp}=6.720\), and \(\chi^{2}=0.919\), consistent with the values reported in literature.[11, 12] On the other hand, we also refined the lattice parameters using single crystal XRD. The lattice parameters are \(a=0.707(3)\) nm, \(b=1.755(5)\) nm, and \(c=3.154(8)\) nm, which are also close to the result obtained from powder XRD and previous results. EDX spectrum of a single crystal [Fig. 1(d)] confirms the presence of only Rh and Bi with the average atomic ratios Rh:Bi = 3.0(4):13.8(4).

The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity \(\rho(T)\) of Rh\({}_{3}\)Bi\({}_{14}\) is shown in Fig. 2(a). The sharp resistivity drop with \(T_{c,\text{onset}}=3.04\) K is caused by a superconducting transition [inset of Fig. 2(a)]. The residual resistivity ratio (RRR), defined as \(\rho(295\) K)/\(\rho(3.04\) K), is about 9.3. The curve \(\rho(T)\) is convex above 50 K, with a tendency to saturate at high temperature. The saturation of \(\rho(T)\) could be related to the Ioffe-Regel limit [17], when the charge carrier mean free path is comparable to the interatomic spacing and/or to the two-band conductivity [18]. According to the phenomenological model [19]

\[\frac{1}{\rho(T)}=\frac{1}{\rho_{\text{ideal}}}+\frac{1}{\rho_{\text{sat}}}, \quad\text{with}\quad\rho_{\text{sat}}\approx\frac{\upsilon_{F}}{\varepsilon_ {0}\Omega_{p}^{2}a},\] (1)

where \(\upsilon_{F}\) is the Fermi velocity, \(\Omega_{p}\) is the plasma frequency, \(a\) is interatomic spacing, and \(\rho_{\text{ideal}}=\rho_{r}+\rho_{i}(T)\) . The \(\rho_{i}(T)\) is the inelastic resistivity due to the phonon contribution, whereas \(\rho_{\text{sat}}\) is the saturation resistivity. Phonon contribution can be explained by the Bloch-Gruneisen formula:

\[\rho_{i}(T)=\left(\frac{c}{\Theta_{D}}\right)\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{D}}\right) ^{5}\int_{0}^{\Theta_{D}/T}\frac{x^{5}}{(e^{x}-1)(1-e^{-x})}dx,\] (2)

where \(\Theta_{D}\) is the Debye temperature and \(c\) is a constant which depends on the electronic structure of the metal through the Fermi velocity \(\upsilon_{F}\) and the density of states at the Fermi energy [20]. The fitting result over the full temperature range of \(\rho_{T}\) is shown in Fig. 2(a) as a solid line, revealing excellent agreement between the model and data for \(\rho_{r}=60.0(4)\)\(\mu\Omega\) cm, \(\rho_{\text{sat}}=640(2)\)\(\mu\Omega\) cm, \(\Theta_{D}=95.0(8)\) K, and \(c=27.7(6)\times 10^{4}\)\(\mu\Omega\) cm.

To confirm the presence of bulk superconductivity in Rh\({}_{3}\)Bi\({}_{14}\) single crystals, the magnetization is measured using the dc susceptibility method. Figure 2(b) shows the temperature dependence of the dc susceptibility for a crystal with dimension of 0.2 \(\times\) 0.4 \(\times\) 0.2 mm\({}^{3}\) for \(H\parallel a\), \(H\parallel b\), and \(H\parallel c\) with zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) under an applied magnetic field of 10 Oe. The steep transition shows that the Rh\({}_{3}\)Bi\({}_{14}\) single crystal has a superconducting transition temperature for all field directions of 2.91 K (\(T_{c,\text{onset}}\)) with a transition width \(\Delta T_{c}=0.30\) K, consistent with the result of resistivity measurement. At 2 K, the ZFC dc susceptibility approaches a value of \(-1\) for all directions after demagnetization correction, indicating bulk superconductivity. The FC signal shows a flux exclusion of 61%, 70%, and 81% for \(H\parallel a\), \(H\parallel b\), and \(H\parallel c\), respectively. The big superconducting volume fraction for FC indicates the rather weak flux pinning effects.

The shape of the \(M(H)\) curve at 1.8 K [Fig. 3(a)] confirms weak pinning, in agreement with Fig. 2(b). In order to obtain the lower critical fields of Rh\({}_{3}\)Bi\({}_{14}\), we measured the initial \(M(H)\) curves at various temperatures with the field directions

Bi4 atoms fill the channels of the framework. (b) Edge-sharing [RhBi\({}_{3/2}\)] cubes and square antiprisms enclosing bismuth ions form the zigzag channel in Rh\({}_{3}\)Bi\({}_{14}\).

  along the \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) axis. For each field direction, all curves clearly fall on the same line and deviate from linearity for different temperatures. Linear fits for the initial parts of the magnetization curves describe the Meissner shielding effects ("Meissner line").

The value of \(H_{c1}^{*}\) at which the field starts to penetrate into the sample can be determined by examining the point of deviation from the Meissner line on the initial slope of the magnetization curve. The first penetration field \(H_{c1}^{*}\) is not the same as the real lower critical field \(H_{c1}\), due to the geometric effect. The \(H_{c1}\) can be deduced from the \(H_{c1}^{*}\), assuming that the magnetization \(M=-H_{c1}\) when the first vortex enters into the sample. Thus \(H\) has been rescaled to \(H=H_{a}-NM\) and \(H_{c1}=H_{c1}^{*}/(1-N)\), where \(N\) is the demagnetization factor and \(H_{a}\) is the external field.[21] We estimate demagnetization factors 0.47, 0.23, and 0.59 for \(H\parallel a\), \(H\parallel b\), and \(H\parallel c\) by using \(H_{c1}=H_{c1}^{*}/\text{tanh}(\sqrt{0.36b/a})\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the width and thickness of a platelike superconductor.[22] The corrected data are plotted in Figs. 3(b), 3(c), and 3(d). Considering the demagnetization factors, the obtained slopes of the linear fitting at the lowest temperature of our measurements \(T=1.8\) K are \(-0.972(2)\), \(-0.988(2)\), and \(-0.987(2)\), very close to \(-1\) (\(4\pi\,M=-H\)) for all field directions. Thus the full Meissner shielding effect in our measurement provides a reliable way to determine the value of \(H_{c1}\).

\(H_{c1}\) is determined as the point deviating from linearity based on the criterion \(\Delta\,M=(M_{m}-M_{\text{th}})=2\times 10^{-6}\) emu, \(M_{m}\) is the measured moment value and \(M_{\text{th}}\) is the fitted moment value at the same external field. From Figs. 3(b), 3(c) and 3(d), \(H_{c1}^{a}\), \(H_{c1}^{b}\), and \(H_{c1}^{c}\) values at the different temperatures can be obtained as shown in Fig. 3(e). The \(H_{c1}(T)\) can be fitted according to \(H_{c1}(T)=H_{c1}(0)[1-(T/T_{c})^{2}]\). Fitting lines are shown in Fig. 3(e). The obtained \(H_{c1}^{b}(0)\), \(H_{c1}^{b}(0)\), and \(H_{c1}^{c}(0)\) are 90(1), 63(1) and 93(1) Oe, respectively. The anisotropy of \(H_{c1}\) along each axis can be determined as shown in Fig. 3(f). It can be seen that the anisotropy of \(H_{c1}(T)\) is very close to 1, especially for \(H\parallel c\) and \(H\parallel a\), indicating that Rh\({}_{3}\)Bi\({}_{14}\) is a nearly isotropic superconductor.

With increasing magnetic fields [Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)] the superconducting transition width broadens and the onset of transition shifts gradually to lower temperatures for both \(H\parallel b\) and \(H\parallel c\). When \(H=6\) kOe, the superconducting transition cannot be observed above 1.9 K for both field directions. It is interesting to observe kinks in the \(R(T)\) curves below \(T_{c}\) under fields for both field directions. The kinks are becoming more pronounced with the increasing field. The origin of these kinks implies rich vortex physics, similar to NbSe\({}_{2}\).[23] The upper critical field \(H_{c2}\) is determined by the criterion of 90% of the normal state resistivity at various fields for both field directions [Fig. 4(c)]. The slopes \(dH_{c2}/dT\) for \(H\parallel b\) and \(H\parallel c\) are

  equal to \(-6.47(5)\) and \(-6.01(11)\) kOe/K, respectively. For dirty limit superconductors, \(H_{c2}(0)\) can be obtained from the Werthammer-Helfand-Hohenberg formula[24]:

\[H_{c2}(0)=-0.693\frac{d\,H_{c2}}{dT}\left|{}_{T_{c}}T_{c},\right.\] (3)

yielding \(H_{c2}^{b}(0)=13.4(1)\) kOe and \(H_{c2}^{c}(0)=12.4(2)\) kOe. Since the Pauli limiting field \(H_{p}(0)=18.4T_{c}\sim\)52 kOe,[25] the orbital effect should be the dominant pair-breaking mechanism. The small difference in the \(H_{c2}\) values for both field directions indicates that Rh\({}_{3}\)Bi\({}_{14}\) shows almost isotropic \(H_{c2}(T)\) as seen in Fig. 4(c).

Since \(H_{c1}^{a}\approx H_{c1}^{c}\), according to the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory, we assume \(\xi_{a}\sim\xi_{c}\) and coherence length \(\xi(0)\) can be estimated from the \(H_{c2}(0)\) with \(H_{c2}^{b}(0)=\Phi_{0}/[2\pi\,\xi_{a}(0)\xi_{c}(0)]\), where \(\Phi_{0}=2.07\times 10^{-15}\) Wb. Based on the values of \(H_{c1}(0)\) and \(H_{c2}(0)\), GL parameters \(\kappa_{i}(0)\) are obtained from the equation \(H_{c2}^{b}(0)/H_{c1}^{i}(0)=2\kappa_{i}^{2}(0)/\ln\kappa_{i}(0)\), where \(i\) denotes the field applied along the \(i\) direction. The thermodynamic critical field \(H_{c}(0)\) can be obtained from \(H_{c2}(0)=H_{c2}^{i}(0)/[\gamma\Delta z_{i}(0)]\). The GL penetration lengths are evaluated by the equations \(\kappa_{b}(0)=\lambda_{a}(0)/\xi_{c}(0)\) and \(\kappa_{a}(0)\approx\kappa_{c}(0)=\lambda_{a}(0)/\xi_{b}(0)=[\lambda_{a}(0) \lambda_{b}(0)/\xi_{c}(0)]_{b}(0)\)[1/2\). The anisotropy is \(\gamma_{\rm anisis}=H_{c2}^{b}(0)/H_{c2}^{c}(0)=\xi_{b}(0)/\xi_{c}(0)\)[26]. All of the obtained parameters are listed in Table 1.

Specific heat divided by temperature [Fig. 5(a)] shows a jump at 2.94 K, indicating the bulk superconducting transition. Specific heat includes both the electron and lattice parts \(C(T)=C_{c}(T)+C_{\rm ph}(T)\). In the normal state, the specific heat of the lattice part is expressed by the \(\beta T^{3}\) term at temperatures far below the Debye temperature \(\Theta_{D}\) and electronic specific heat is assumed to be \(\sim\)\(\gamma\)\(T\). Using \(C_{p}/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}\) we obtain [Fig. 5(a)] \(\gamma=8(1)\) mJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\) and \(\Theta_{D}\sim 113.9(7)\) K using \(\Theta_{D}=(12\pi^{4}NR/5\beta)^{1/3}\), where \(N=17\) is the number of atoms per formula unit and \(R\) is the gas constant. \(\Theta_{D}\) is similar to the value obtained from \(\rho(T)\). The electron-phonon coupling constant \(\lambda_{\rm e-ph}\) is obtained from the McMillan equation:

\[\lambda_{\rm e-ph}=\frac{\mu^{*}\ln(1.45T_{c}/\Theta_{D})-1.04}{1.04+\ln(1.45T _{c}/\Theta_{D})(1-0.62\mu^{*})},\] (4)

and assuming the common value for the Coulomb pseudopotential \(\mu^{*}\approx 0.13\). The value of \(\lambda_{\rm e-ph}\) is determined to be 0.74(1) by using \(T_{c}=2.94\) K and \(\Theta_{D}=113.9(7)\) K. The

  value of \(\lambda_{\text{e-ph}}\) implies intermediately or weakly coupled BCS superconductivity. The electronic specific heat \(C_{\text{es}}\) in the superconducting state [Fig. 5(b)] is obtained by subtracting the lattice contribution estimated from the total specific heat. The extracted specific heat jump at \(T_{c}\) [\(\Delta C/\gamma T_{c}=1.8(2)\)] is somewhat larger than the weak coupling value 1.43, and also points to intermediate coupling strength.[27]

Rh\({}_{3}\)Bi\({}_{12}\)Br\({}_{2}\) has a similar structure to Rh\({}_{3}\)Bi\({}_{14}\), but the two Bi atoms at Bi4 position are replaced by the Br atoms. Rh\({}_{3}\)Bi\({}_{12}\)Br\({}_{2}\) is a metal above 2 K without superconducting transition.[15] From theoretical calculation,[12] the density of state (DOS) at Fermi energy is similar for both compounds, however the contributions of atoms (\(s\) and \(p\) states of Bi) at Bi4 position to DOS are nearly removed when voids in the crystal structure are filled with Br atoms. Therefore, the superconductivity in Rh\({}_{3}\)Bi\({}_{14}\) might be related to the \(s\) and \(p\) states of the Bi atom in the interstitial Bi4 position of Rh\({}_{3}\)Bi\({}_{14}\).

## IV Conclusion

In summary, we present a comprehensive study of the normal and superconducting state properties of metastable intermetallic superconductor Rh\({}_{3}\)Bi\({}_{14}\). The temperature dependence of resistivity \(\rho(T)\) above the superconducting transition can be explained by the phonon scattering. Rh\({}_{3}\)Bi\({}_{14}\) is an isotropic, weakly to intermediately coupled BCS superconductor. Presence (absence) of superconductivity in Rh\({}_{3}\)Bi\({}_{14}\) (Rh\({}_{3}\)Bi\({}_{12}\)Br\({}_{2}\)) suggests that the nature of atoms that fill the pores in the structure is rather important.
