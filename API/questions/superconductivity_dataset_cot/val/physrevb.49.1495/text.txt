###### Abstract

We have performed dc magnetization studies in the _c_-axis-oriented bulk Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{10}\) compound. The penetration depth \(\lambda_{ab}(T)\) is extracted from reversible magnetization data \(M(H)\) taking into account fluctuations of the vortices. An "irreversibility line" is quantitatively compared with predictions of flux-line-lattice (FLL) melting models. The results strongly suggest that the "irreversibility line" near \(T_{c}\) is associated with melting of FLL caused by thermal fluctuations.

It is now widely accepted that thermal fluctuations play an important role in the thermodynamic and transport properties of high-temperature superconductors. The large fluctuations are caused by the high transition temperature \(T_{c}\), the short coherence length \(\xi\), and strong anisotropy of these materials. The fluctuations are responsible for the "anomalous" behavior of reversible magnetization \(M(H,T)\).1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Here the magnetization becomes independent of field at some temperature \(T^{\ast}\), which is several degrees below the mean-field transition temperature \(T_{c0}\), i.e., all \(M(T)\) curves for different \(H\) cross at the temperature \(T^{\ast}\). The experimental results have been well described in the model of a three-dimensional (3D) \(XY\) critical point [7] and in terms of the Ginsburg-Landau fluctuation theory, using the lowest Landau-level approximation. [8] Bulaevskii, Ledvij, and Kogan [9] have shown that in the London regime where the magnetization logarithmically changes with field, the existence of the crossing temperature \(T^{\ast}\) is a result of thermal fluctuations of vortices. They also argue that the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{\rm SC}\) in layered superconductors is the analog of the Kosterlitz-Thouless vortex-antivortex dissociation temperature which lies below \(T_{c0}\). Thus, the resistivity approaches zero at \(T_{\rm SC}\). For \(T>T_{\rm SC}\), the motion of dissociated vortex-antivortex pairs give rise to dissipation. Further Kogan _et al._[10] have demonstrated from magnetization measurements in Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) that vortex fluctuations have a strong influence on the London penetration depth \(\lambda(T)\). On the other hand, strong fluctuations can lead to melting of the flux-line lattice. [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] In the high-temperature region where the London penetration depth \(\lambda(T)\propto(1-T/T_{c})^{-1/2}\), 3D FLL melting models predict a power law for the "melting line" (ML) of the form \(H_{m}\propto(1-T/T_{c})^{\alpha}\), with \(\alpha=2\). [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, where \(\gamma^{2}\) is the effective-mass ratio \(m_{c}/m_{ab}\), \(d\) is the distance between weakly coupled superconducting CuO\({}_{2}\) planes, \(\lambda_{ab}\) is the in-plane penetration depth, \(\kappa = \lambda_{ab}/\xi_{ab}\), \(H_{c2}(T) = \phi_{0}/2\pi\xi_{ab}^{2}\) is the upper critical magnetic field, \(\alpha\) and \(\eta\) are parameters of the order unity, \(e = 2.718.\ldots\) . The second term in Eq. (1) is associated with fluctuations and it leads to correction of the slope of the linear \(M(\ln H)\) dependence which is given by

\[\frac{\partial M}{\partial\ln H} = \frac{\phi_{0}}{32\pi^{2}\lambda_{ab}^{2}(T)}[1 - g(T)]\ ,\]

where the correction term \(g(T)\) is

\[g(T) = \frac{32\pi^{2}k_{B}}{\phi_{0}^{2}d}\,T\lambda_{ab}^{2}(T)\ .\]

The magnetic-field-independent magnetization at the crossover temperature is

\[-M(T^{\star}) = (k_{B}T^{\star}/\phi_{0}d)\ln(\eta\alpha/\sqrt{e})\ ,\]

where \(\ln(\eta\alpha/\sqrt{e})\approx 1\) (Refs. 9 and 10). Using the experimental value of \(M(T^{\star}) \approx - 0.4\) G (Fig. 1) we find \(d \approx 18\) A. This value is in very good agreement with our x-ray result (\(c/2 \approx 18.6\) A) and others[23-25] and it can be considered as the average distance between Josephson-coupled CuO\({}_{2}\) planes (see also Ref. 26).

Evaluating the slopes \(\partial M/\partial\ln H\) of Fig. 1 and using Eqs. (2) and (3), we determine \(\lambda_{ab}(T)\) for both neglecting and taking into consideration the correction term \(g(T)\). These results are shown in Fig. 2(a). Here the fluctuation contribution to \(\lambda_{ab}(T)\) is very clear, particularly in the vicinity of \(T_{c}\). This strong influence of vortex fluctuations on \(\lambda_{ab}(T)\) in Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{10}\) is similar to the result obtained for Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\).[10] From the temperature dependence of \(\lambda_{ab}(T)\) at \(T_{c0}-T \ll T_{c0}\),

\[\lambda_{ab}(T) = \lambda_{ab}(0)[T_{c0}/2(T_{c0}-T)]^{1/2}\ ,\]

one can derive [9]

\[1 - \frac{T^{\star}}{T_{c0}} = \frac{16\pi^{2}k_{B}T_{c0}\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0)}{\phi_{0}^{2}d}\ .\]

Using Eq. (5) and \(g(T^{\star}) = 1\), we find for our sample \(\lambda_{ab}(0) = 1240 \pm 10\) A and \(T_{c0} = 111.6 \pm 0.1\) K. Figure 2(b) displays \(\lambda_{ab}\) data as a function of \((1 - T/T_{c0})\) in a double logarithmic scale. The dashed line in Fig. 2(b) is obtained from Eq. (4) with \(\lambda_{ab}(0) = 1240\) A and \(T_{c0} = 111.6\) K. As can be seen, Eq. (4) without any fitting parameter, describes very well the experimental \(\lambda_{ab}(T)\) data for high temperatures when vortex fluctuations are taken into account.

It is interesting to estimate \(T_{\rm SC}\), which is shown to be [9]

\[T_{\rm SC} = T_{c0}\left[1 - \frac{(1 - T^{\star}/T_{c0})}{2(\ln\kappa + 0.5)}\right.\] (6) \[\left. \times \ln\frac{(1 - T^{\star}/T_{c0})(\lambda_{J}/\xi_{ab})^{2}}{\alpha\pi\ln(\lambda_{J}/\xi_{ab})}\right]\ ,\]

where \(\lambda_{J} = \gamma d\) is the Josephson length. Using \(\gamma = 31\) (Ref. 27) and \(d = 18\) A, we have \(\lambda_{J} = 558\) A. From experimental values for \(T^{\star} \approx 106\) K, \(\lambda_{ab}(0) = 1240\) A and considering \(\xi_{ab}(0) = 10\) A (Ref. 4), one can calculate \(T_{\rm SC} = 110.3\) K and \(T_{c0} - T_{\rm SC} = 1.3\) K. The obtained \(T_{c0} - T_{\rm SC}\) difference in Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{10}\) is smaller when compared with more anisotropic compounds, Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)\([T_{c0} - T_{\rm SC} = 2.1\) K (Ref. 28) or 3 K (Ref.

(b) The same results in a double logarithmic scale \(\lambda_{ab}\) vs \((1 - T/T_{c0})\); the dashed line is obtained from Eq. (4) with determined parameters \(\lambda_{ab}(0) = 1240\) Å and \(T_{c0} = 111.6\) K.

  29)] and Tl2Ba2CuO6 [ \(T_{c0} - T_{\rm SC} = 2.6\) K (Ref. [6]). This result is consistent with the theoretical expectation.9

The penetration depth data of Fig. 2 allow us to make a quantitative comparison of the IL with a theoretical ML. Below a crossover field \(H_{\rm 2D-3D} \approx \phi_{0}/\gamma^{2}d^{2}\), the melting phase transition is of a 3D nature and for magnetic fields applied parallel to the \(c\) axis, ML is given by the following expression:12-16

\[H_{m}(T) = \frac{\phi_{c}^{5}\epsilon_{L}^{4}}{16\pi^{4}k_{B}^{2}\mu_{0}^{2} \gamma^{2}\lambda_{ab}^{4}(T)T^{2}}\ ,\]

where \(c_{L}\) is the Lindemann number. Using the experimental data of \(\lambda_{ab}(T),\gamma = 31\), and \(c_{L}\) as a free parameter, we can calculate \(H_{m}(T)\). In Fig. 3(a) the calculated values of \(H_{m}(T)\) using Eq. (7) are presented. As seen in this figure, \(H_{m}(T)\) values, taking into account fluctuation corrections for \(\lambda_{ab}(T)\) and using \(c_{L} = 0.28\), match perfectly our experimental low-field and high-temperature irreversibility points.30 At the same time, it is not possible to fit the experimental data using \(\lambda_{ab}(T)\) without the fluctuation corrections. The dashed line in Fig. 3(a) corresponds to the best approach to the IL for this case. Substituting Eq. (4) in Eq. (7) one can have for temperatures \(1 - T/T_{c0} < 1\),

\[H_{m}(T) = A(1 - T/T_{c0})^{2}\ ,\]

where

\[A = \frac{\phi_{0}^{5}\epsilon_{L}^{4}}{4\pi^{4}k_{B}^{2}\mu_{0}^{2}\gamma^{2} \lambda_{ab}^{4}(0)T_{c0}^{2}}\ .\]

Taking \(\lambda_{ab}(0) = 1240\) A, \(T_{c0} = 111.6\) K, \(\gamma = 31\), and \(c_{L} = 0.28\), we obtain \(A \approx 0.6\) T. In order to further test the melting models we have plotted \(H_{m}\) as a function of \((1 - T/T_{c0})\) in a double logarithmic scale [Fig. 3(b)]. The agreement of the experimental IL data with Eq. (8) is excellent [solid line in Fig. 3(b)]. Here we have also plotted the dc irreversibility data from (Ref. [20] for Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10, assuming the same value of \(T_{c0}\). They coincide with our IL. The inset of Fig. 3(b) presents the same data now replotted in terms of \((1 - T/T_{c})\) with \(T_{c} = 109\) and \(108\) K as obtained in the present work and in Ref. [20], respectively. The dashed line corresponds to the relationship \(H \propto (1 - T/T_{c})^{2}\). As seen, the behavior of IL's in this case is qualitatively inconsistent with the 3D melting result and thus illustrates the importance of using the relevant reduced temperature \(T = T/T_{c0}\) when testing melting hypotheses, particularly in strongly anisotropic superconductors where the \((T_{c0} - T_{c})\) difference can be sufficiently large. The Josephson coupling changes the dimensionality of the FLL with field. Above the crossover field \(H_{\rm 2D-3D} \approx 0.64\) T, the FLL has 2D character and different mechanisms can be responsible for defining the IL in this region.14,31 The deviation of experimental IL from 3D ML with increasing field is clearly seen in Fig. 3. The large field and low-temperature part of IL can be approximated by the power law \(H_{i}(T) \propto (1 - t)^{\alpha}\) with an exponent \(\alpha \geq 4\). Discussion of this regime is not within the scope of the present work.

In summary, the results for Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10 presented here show that the behavior of the magnetization curves \(M(H)\) in the fully reversible regime above IL can be consistently described by the vortex fluctuation theory of Bulaevskii, Ledvij, and Kogan.9 The system parameters are determined. They are crossover temperature \(T^{\star} \approx 106\) K, mean-field transition temperature \(T_{\rm c0} = 111.6 \pm 0.1\) K, superconducting or vortex unbinding temperature \(T_{\rm SC} = 110.3\) K, London penetration depth

Inset: the same data replotted in terms of \((1 - T/T_{c})\); the dashed line corresponds to \(H \propto (1 - T/T_{c})^{2}\).

  \(\lambda_{ab}(0) = 1240 \pm 10\) A, and the distance between weakly coupled CuO\({}_{2}\) planes \(d \approx 18\) A. The results give evidence for a strong fluctuation effect on \(\lambda_{ab}(T)\) similar to that observed in Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\).[10] The IL is quantitatively compared to predictions of 3D FLL melting models,[11]\({}^{-}\)[16] using the determined system parameters. From this we conclude that IL close to \(T_{c}\) is associated with 3D melting of FLL caused by thermal fluctuations.
