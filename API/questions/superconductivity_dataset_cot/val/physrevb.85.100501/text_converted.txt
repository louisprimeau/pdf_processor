REVIEW B **85**, 100501(R) (2012)

The recent discovery of superconductivity in iron selenide compounds
A,Fe2-ySe2 and (T1, _A_),Fe2-ySe2 (where A = K, Rb, Cs),[1, 2, 3, 4]
with transition temperatures up to about 32 K, has led to a renewed
interest in iron-based chalcogenide systems. The average crystal
structure of these materials is of the ThCr2Si2 type (space group
I4/_mmm_).[5] A remarkable observation is that, besides the
superconducting state, a strong antiferromagnetic state with magnetic
moments up to 3.3 _m_B per Fe ion are observed below _T_N = 478 K, 534
K, and 559 K for A = Cs, Rb, and K, respectively (see Refs. [6, 7, 8,
9]). Actually, the stoichiometry of the parent compound appears to be
near A0,SeFe1.6Se2 (hence the often used denomination "245"). Fe vacancy
order has been found to occur below a structural phase transition _T_S
taking place well above _T_N.[7, 9, 10]

As the interplay with magnetism is thought to play a major role in
understanding the properties of the superconducting state in iron-based
systems, many studies have been devoted to this topic. The coexistence
of magnetism and superconductivity has been reported in pnictide-"122"
systems.[11, 12, 13] A characteristic of this iron-based family is that
the temperature of the magnetic transition needs to decrease by doping
or external pressure prior to observing a superconducting state at low
temperature. Hence, it appears that in the pnictide-122 systems static
magnetism has to be destroyed by a control parameter such as doping or
pressure before superconductivity can develop its full strength.[14, 15]
On the other hand, there are some indications that the interplay in the
chalcogenide iron-based systems might be rather opposite in nature than
the one observed in the pnictides. Hence, an unusual behavior has been
reported in the FeSe1-_x_ family under pressure, where one observes that
both the magnetic[16] and superconducting[16, 17] transition
temperatures increase with increasing pressure above 0.8 GPa.

Hence, as a new iron-based chalcogenide superconductor family, the
A,Fe2-ySe2 systems have attracted many studies focused on the
understanding of the nature of the interplay between the strong magnetic
state occurring at high temperature and the superconductivity in the
same samples. Muon spin relaxation or rotation (_m_SR),[8] transport and
magnetization,[6] specific heat, magneto-optical imaging,[18] and
Mossbauer[19] spectroscopy suggest a microscopic coexistence and the
bulk character of both the strong antiferromagnetism and
superconductivity. Some studies claim that superconductivity only occurs
in the compositions when Fe content is compatible with a vacancy order
pattern; the ground state of the material becomes metallic and
superconductivity sets in.[20] Alternatively, others suggest that
superconductivity is achieved when the Fe vacancies are disordered and
that superconductivity and magnetism occur in the same samples, but
microscopically separated.[21] In this Rapid Communication, we report on
_m_SR studies specifically devoted to superconducting properties of the
A,Fe2-ySe2 systems, shedding more light on the question of the bulk
character of the superconducting state at low temperatures.

Single crystals were grown from a melt using the Bridgman method.[3] The
homogeneity and elemental composition of cleaved crystals have been
studied using x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF; Orbis Micro-XRF
Analyzer, EDAX), and were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction
using a D8 Advance Bruker AXS diffractometer with Cu Kor radiation. The
final compositions were found to be Rb0.77Fe1.61Se2 and K0.74Fe1.66Se2.
Magnetization and resistivity measurements have been performed with a
physical property measurement system Quantum Design 9T.

For the _m_SR measurements, performed using the transverse-field (TF)
and zero-field (ZF) techniques, the DOLLY instrument located on the
_p_E1 beam line of the Swiss Muon Source (Paul Scherrer Institute,
Villigen, Switzerland) was used. Measurements were performed using a
static helium flow cryostat between 2 and 40 K.

A first step of our study has been to elucidate the superconducting
properties of the A,Fe2-ySe2 crystals by performing in-plane
zero-field-cooling (ZFC) magnetization measurements, shown in Fig. 1(a).
Both samples exhibit sharp superconducting transitions at $T_{\rm c}$ =
31.0(2) K and 32.6(2) K for A = K and Rb, respectively, and a nearly 100

The first goal of our μSR study was to check the magnetic properties by
the ZF and weak TF (wTF) technique. In agreement with our previous
measurements,[8] we observe that a large fraction of the μSR signal is
wiped out at very early time (i.e., t ≪ 0.1μs), in the wTF as well as in
the ZF measurements, due to a large internal field and/or a broad field
distribution in the antiferromagnetic phase of the sample.[23] From the
wTF measurements it is derived that this phase represents about 88

This fraction of the sample remaining paramagnetic below $T_{\rm N}$
opens the possibility to study the superconducting state by μSR, using
the μSR TF technique.[24] The first step of our TF μSR measurements was
to determine the optimal external magnetic field $H_{\rm ext}$ (with
$H_{\rm ext}>H_{\rm c1}$) for which a maximal muon spin depolarization
rate ($\sigma_{\rm sc}$, see below) occurs due to the buildup of a flux
line lattice (FLL) in the mixed state of the superconductor.[25] The
field dependence of $\sigma_{\rm sc}$ was obtained upon field cooling
from above $T_{\rm c}$ down to 2 K for each data point [see Fig. 2(c)].
For both Rb and K systems, the optimum field is above 0.07 T and a
complete temperature scan was performed with this external field applied
along the c axis. Typical μSR spectra, as well as the corresponding
Fourier transforms, are reported in the panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 1 for
A = Rb.

The TF-μSR time spectra were analyzed using a two-Gaussian
depolarization function:

$$A_{0}P(t) = A_{\rm sc}\exp\bigg{(}-\frac{\big{(}\sigma_{\rm sc}^{2}+\sigma_{ \rm n}^{2}\big{)}t^{2}}{2}\bigg{)}\cos(\gamma_{\mu}B_{\rm inf}t+\varphi)$$
(1)
$$\quad+A_{\rm bg}\exp\bigg{(}-\frac{\sigma_{\rm bg}^{2}t^{2}}{2} \bigg{)}\cos(\gamma_{\mu}B_{\rm bg}t+\varphi),$$

where $A_{\rm sc}$ is an initial asymmetry, $B_{\rm inf}$ represents the
internal magnetic field at the muon site, and $\sigma_{\rm sc}$ is the
Gaussian relaxation rate reflecting the second moment of the magnetic
field distribution due to the FLL in the mixed state. $\sigma_{\rm n}$,
representing the depolarization due to the nuclear magnetic moments, is
taken from the fits above $T_{\rm c}$ and considered as temperature
independent down to 2 K. The second term of Eq. (1) represents a
background signal (bg) corresponding to

$\sigma_{\rm sc}\sim\lambda_{\rm sh}^{-2}$ and therefore of the

Due to the very high damping signal occurring in the antiferromagnetic
phase of the sample [8] one is unable to measure any superconducting
response for this fraction. However, as discussed below, this does not
exclude that such a phase presents also a superconducting state.

Figure 2(a) exhibits for both systems the temperature dependence of the
muon depolarization rate $\sigma_{\rm sc}$ reflecting the field
distribution created by the FLL. The temperature dependence of the
average value of the internal field _B_int sensed by the muon ensemble
is reported in Fig. 2(b). A clear diamagnetic response of the samples is
observed below _T_c. Considering an extreme-type-II superconductor, one
can evaluate the London magnetic penetration depth λ and superfluid
density n_(s) from the second moment of the magnetic field distribution
inside the sample in the mixed SC state, or alternatively, from the
Gaussian muon spin depolarization rate $\sigma_{\rm sc}$: [25]

$$\frac{\sigma_{\rm sc}^{2}(T)}{\gamma_{n}^{2}}=0.00371\frac{\Phi_{0}^{2}}{ \lambda_{\rm dB}^{4}(T)},$$
(2)

where Φ₀ = 2.068 × 10⁻¹⁵ Wb is the magnetic flux quantum, and
γ_(n)/2π = 135.5 MHz T⁻¹ is the muon gyromagnetic ratio (note that as
the external field is applied along the c axis; we are probing the
penetration depth $\lambda_{\rm ab}$ in the basal plane). In turn, from
the temperature dependence of $\lambda_{\rm ab}$, one obtains the
temperature evolution of the superfluid density n_(s) as
$n_{s}(T)/n_{s}(0)=\lambda_{\rm ab}^{-2}(T)/\lambda_{\rm ab}^{-2}(0)$.
Here we would like to mention that the described analysis neglects any
additional contribution to the μSR relaxation rate due to possible FLL
disorder or induced magnetism. [26] Therefore the extracted value of the
penetration depth represents a lower limit. The temperature dependence
of n_(s) was analyzed within the framework of a BCS single s-wave
symmetry superconducting gap Δ. [27, 28] The results of the analysis for
A_(s)Fe_(2 − γ)Se₂ (A = K, Rb) are reported in Fig. 2(a). The solid line
represents the fit of a simple s-wave model to the data. Due to the
flattening of $\sigma_{\rm sc}(T)$ below _T_c/2 a clean d-wave model is
incompatible with the data. Note that a two gap (s + s) as well as an
anisotropic s-wave scenario provides also a satisfactory χ² fitting
criteria. The parameters extracted from the fitting procedure using the
simplest s-wave model are summarized in Table 1. The observed values of
2Δ(0)/k_(B)T_(c) indicate that A_(s)Fe_(2 − γ)Se₂ systems are in the
strong-coupling limit.

The reader should keep in mind that the penetration depth obtained from
the data analysis corresponds to the paramagnetic fraction representing
about 12

Figure 2(c) shows the field dependence at 2 K of the muon depolarization
rate obtained upon field cooling from above _T_c down to base
temperature. Above $\mu_{0}H_{\rm ext}=0.07$ T, $\sigma_{\rm sc}$
decreases only very slightly indicating a high value of the critical
field _H_c2. Previous measurements reported values on the order of
$\mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}^{*}(0)=60$ T for Rb_(0.88)Fe_(1.76)Se₂ (Ref. [4]) and
for K_(0.88)Fe_(1.81)Se₂ (Ref. [33]). The solid lines in Fig. 2(c)
correspond to a fit based on the numerical Ginzburg-Landau model (NGL)
with the local (London) approximation (λ ≫ ξ; ξ is the coherence length)
[23] for both systems. This model describes the magnetic field
dependence of the second moment of the field distribution created by the
FLL and therefore the field dependence of the μSR depolarization rate.
Fixing the value of $\mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(2$ K
$)= 55 T found in the literature [4, 35] and considering \(\lambda_{\rm ab}$
as a free parameter, we get $\lambda_{\rm ab}(2$ K) = 246(1) and 221(3)
nm for A = Rb and K, respectively. These values are in good agreement
with the values obtained by studying the temperature dependence of the
muon depolarization rate (see Table 1).

Since the observation of strong magnetism ($m_{\rm Fe}>2$$\mu_{\rm B}$
and $T_{\rm N}=478$ K) [8] in one of the members of the newly discovered
A_(s)Fe_(2 − γ)Se₂ superconductors, the most intriguing question to
answer by theory as well as by experimental observation is whether or
not superconductivity and magnetism may coexist microscopically or
whether they live apart together in the same sample but in a
phase-separated manner. Unfortunately experimental techniques that
simultaneously can measure strong magnetism and superconductivity
locally are lacking. Therefore conclusions have to be drawn from a
combination of observations obtained from two or more experimental
methods. There are good arguments for both scenarios. First we will
summarize a few arguments in favor of bulk superconductivity.

In a first step we will discuss techniques that provide macroscopic
information on the superconducting state. In the majority of the reports

hysteresis loop were found that can be understood in the picture that
superconductivity in the sample is percolative with weakly coupled
superconducting islands.[22] The interpretation of specific-heat data in
view of the superconducting volume fraction is dangerous since it relies
on the determination of the electronic Sommerfeld coefficient which is
assumed to be the same for the whole sample. This assumption might
anyhow not be valid for a potential phase separation into metallic and
insulating volumes. Strong evidence for bulk superconductivity comes
from magneto-optical imaging[18] of a uniform flux distribution after
the sample was cooled in a field which was switched off at low
temperatures. This is consistent with the bulk superconducting nature of
the sample and shows that it is not filamentary or phase separated.[18]
Further, different magnetization measurements yield a rather large
$\mu_{0}R_{\rm cl}=13$ mT and a corresponding magnetic penetration depth
of λ = 580 nm[30] which is hard to understand for filamentary
superconductivity. On the other hand, in the samples showing indications
of bulk superconductivity, i.e., 100

There are several experiments revealing different kinds of phase
separation in different $A_{\rm s}$Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ compounds. Depending on
the experimental technique they are able to directly detect a
structural, nonsuperconducting/superconducting or a magnetic/nonmagnetic
phase separation. The determination of a magnetic/superconducting phase
separation by these techniques is anyhow only possible on the basis of
plausible arguments. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals a
rich variety of microstructures related to Fe vacancy order.[39] The
superconducting samples clearly appear to be phase separated suggesting
that the superconducting phase could have a Fe vacancy disordered state.
Similarly, scanning nanofocus single-crystal x-ray diffraction[40]
reveals a structural phase separation in domains with a compressed and
an expanded lattice structure where the latter might be associated with
a magnetic phase adopting a Fe vacancy ordered structure. On the
contrary, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) able to detect local
structural and electronic properties indicates a microscopic coexistence
of superconductivity and a $\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{2}$ charge modulation
likely caused by block-spin antiferromagnetic ordering.[41] It should be
noted anyhow that the STM measurements did not observe the usually
observed Fe vacancy ordering pattern (which according to neutron
measurements exhibits a block-spin antiferromagnetic state) but rather a
vacancy-free FeSe layer and therefore there might be as well two
different magnetic structures.

Optical spectroscopy observes a Josephson-coupling plasmon of
superconducting condensate.[42] This together with a TEM analysis
suggests a nanoscale stripe-type phase separation between
superconductivity and insulating phases. In addition, optical
conductivity measurements in the THz region observe a very low charge
carrier density in favor of a phase-separated picture with a minor
metallic and a dominant semiconducting phase.[43]

Local probe techniques such as μSR (our present and earlier studies)[8]
and Mossbauer[19, 44, 45] show a phase separation into a 85-95

In this study we showed that all our $A_{\rm r}$Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ samples
exhibit a paramagnetic volume fraction of about 12
