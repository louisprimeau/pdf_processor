###### Abstract

The thermal conductivity K(T) of polycrystalline YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} with M=Zn and Al (0 \leqx\leq 0.1) and Y_{1-y},R_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} with R=Pr and Gd (0 \leqy\leq 1.0) has been measured for temperatures 1.2 \leqT\leq 200 K. In the pure material, K(T) decreases slightly with decreasing temperature above T_{c} and below T_{c} there is a strong enhancement of K(T) reaching a maximum at \sim 50 K followed by a sharp decrease. At temperatures below 10 K a T^{2} dependence is evident similar to behavior reported for amorphous systems with glasslike phonon scattering on the tunneling states. Doping with Zn or Pr rapidly depresses T_{c} and also depresses the maximum in K(T) even at concentrations that remain superconducting. This effect is observable to a lesser degree for the Al and Gd dopants. Comparisons between the K(T) behavior for impurities that do not depress T_{c} with those that diversely alter the superconducting properties are presented together with an analysis of the data using the Tewordt-Wolkhausen (TW) theory.

## I Introduction

Thermal conductivity has been extensively studied in high-T_{c} superconductors due to it advantage in probing the scattering processes of phonons and electrons in both normal and superconducting states. In addition, it can also provide invaluable information on the superconducting energy gap, excitation spectrum and lifetimes, and electron-phonon coupling parameters which are still being vigorously pursued by theorists and experimentalists in these materials.

There have been many reports [1] of thermal conductivity measurements in high-T_{c} superconductors, however, these studies have almost exclusively concentrated on pure polycrystalline and single-crystal samples with very few studies reporting on doped compounds. A common feature of K(T) for the high-T_{c} superconductors, e.g., YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} and Tl_{1}Ba_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta}, is a rapid rise with increasing T below T_{c}, reaching a maximum at approximately T_{c}/2 followed by a decrease and a sharp break in K(T) at T=T_{c}. [1] In sintered samples, this maximum is approximately 20% higher than the value of K(T) at T_{c}, and in single crystals the maximum may approach 100%. There have been several explanations proposed for this anomaly. For example, if the total thermal conductivity in the normal state is dominated by phonon conduction, and the phonons are significantly limited by electron-phonon scattering, then for T<T_{c}, Cooper pairs form and the number of electrons available to scatter phonons falls rapidly, resulting in an increase in the mean free path of the phonons and an enhancement in K(T). Such behavior has been seen in conventional superconductors, e.g., (Pb,Bi) alloys. [2] The electrical transport properties of these high-T_{c} layer oxide superconductors are extremely anisotropic and this anisotropy is also apparent in K(T). Hagen, Wang, and Ong [3] measured both the in-plane and out-of-plane K(T) from 10 to 330 K in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} crystals. They found that K_{c} [out-of-plane K(T)] is four to five times smaller and apparently does not have a maximum for T<T_{c}. However, K_{ab} [in-plane K(T)] does have a pronounced maximum. Using the measured electrical resistivity and the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law, the in-plane electronic contribution K_{ab}^{\ast} was estimated to be approximately 55% of the total K_{ab} above T_{c}. However, the K_{ab} of oxygen deficient, insulating YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} crystals shows a large phonon contribution, approximately the same magnitude as K_{ab} in superconducting crystals. These results have lead to a model where strong in-plane electron-phonon scattering in the normal state combined with an increase in the phonon lifetime due to a decrease in the quasiparticle scattering accounts for the strong enhancement of K(T) below T_{c} for superconducting samples. It is also suggested that the electron-phonon coupling strengths are extremely anisotropic. Alternate models have been proposed. Recently, Yu _et al._[4] measured the in-plane thermal conductivities in single-crystal YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and attributed the rapid rise in K(T) with decreasing T in the superconducting state to an electron (hole) contribution from the Cu-O plane, which increases rapidly below T_{c} due to the strongly suppressed quasiparticle scattering and concomitant increase of the quasiparticle, i.e., electron (hole), mean free path.

These explanations serve to illustrate the controversial nature of K(T) and the potential of it providing insight into the quasiparticle spectrum and lifetimes for these systems if a more definitive understanding of the T dependence of K(T) is established. The controversial nature of K(T) and its potential to provide indirect observations of quasiparticle parameters has driven our interest in extending these measurements to studies of impurity effects on the thermal conductivity. Such studies could lead to a greater insight into the relative contributions to K(T) and possibly indirect measurements of the quasiparticle spectrum within the superconducting state.

In this paper, we present the results of thermal conduc tivity _K_(_T_) measurements in selectively doped polycrystalline YBa2(Cu1-_x_M_x_)O7 with M = Zn and Al (0 <= x <= 0.1) and Y1-_y_R_yBa2Cu3O7 with R = Pr and Gd (0 <= y <= 1.0) for temperatures 1.2 <= T <= 200 K along with comparisons and a theoretical analysis of the data using the Tewordt-Wolkhausen (TW) theory.5

## II Experiment

Polycrystalline samples of composition YBa2(Cu1-_x_M_x_)O7 with M = Zn and Al (0 <= x <= 0.1) and Y1-_y_R_yBa2Cu3O7 with R = Pr and Gd (0 <= y <= 1.0) were prepared using standard solid-state reaction techniques.6,7 The final specimens were checked by x-ray diffraction for phase purity and preferred orientation. In addition, electrical transport and low-field magnetization was measured to better characterize the samples. These measurements have indicated that all samples used in this study were single phase with less than 2% impurities and had T_{c} vs x and y was consistent with previous studies.6,7 In addition, x-ray and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies have indicated that there was no preferred orientation in any of the sintered samples. Samples with a typical size of 1 x 2 x 10 mm3 were cut from pellets or directly made with a bar press. At several concentrations, numerous samples with different sample densities were prepared and measured to better define the impact of voids and particle size on _K_(_T_). These studies at different densities have indicated that the results to be presented within this paper are not an artifact of the ceramic nature of the samples, and provide some valuable insight to the intrinsic response of these very interesting systems.

The thermal conductivity was measured using a conventional four-probe heat-pulse method.1 A heater (metal film or resistor) was attached to one end of the sample while the other end was firmly epoxied (or soldered) to a variable temperature heat sink. The temperature gradient across the sample was measured using a differential chromel-constantan thermocouple for 25 <= T <= 250 K and a pair of calibrated carbon thermometers for T < 25 K. The temperature difference D_T_ during the measurements was typically between 0.3 and 1.0 K depending on the temperature of the sample.

## III Results and Discussion

In Fig. 1(a), we present _K_(_T_) for two fully oxygenated YBa2Cu3O7 polycrystalline samples with densities of 4.85 and 5.31 g/cm3. Ceramic samples typically have densities less than the theoretical value (~6.4 g/cm3) due to voids which may act as scattering centers for phonons and modify the measured _K_(_T_). Our results clearly show that the magnitudes of _K_(_T_) varies with density, however, the general features of _K_(_T_), i.e., the rapid increase of _K_(_T_) at T_{c} and the peak at T ~_T_c_/2, are quite similar. These common features can be more clearly observed by plotting the normalized thermal conductivity, _K_(_T_)/_K_(180 K), vs T as shown in Fig. 1(b). The _K_(_T_)/_K_(180 K) curves of different densities nearly overlap each other, indicating that the intrinsic temperature dependence of _K_(_T_) is given by the normalized _K_(_T_)/_K_(180 K) and this quantity is relatively insensitive to void density.

In the temperature range 100-180 K, _K_(_T_) is essentially temperature independent. At T = T_{c}, a sudden increase in thermal conductivity with decreasing T reaching a peak at T ~50 K is evident, with _K_(_T_) falling off at lower temperatures. These features are similar to those reported by other groups.1 We assume a conventional additive thermal conductivity arising from charge carriers, i.e., electrons (holes), and phonons, i.e., _K_(_T_)=_K_(_T_)+_K_(_T_). The charge carrier contribution to the _K_(_T_) can be roughly estimated using the WF law in conjunction with the measured electrical resistivity, i.e., K_{\ast} = L_{0}T/\rho, where L_{0} = 2.45 \times 10^{- 8} W O K-2 is the Lorentz number and r is the electrical resistivity. We find that K_{\ast}/K \leq 0.2 for both densities at T = 100 K. Even though such an estimate is crude and could be slightly in error, we take the position as most previous researchers have done that the dominant contribution to _K_(_T_) is due to phonon conduction. This position is consistent with other studies reported on _K_(_T_), however, as indicated earlier, it is not the only interpretation. Our analysis assuming that _K_(_T_) is dominated by phonon conduction is consistent with _K_(_T_) measurements of oxygen deficient, insulating samples (to be discussed) and a comparison to results for the superconducting samples.

Within these assumptions, the sharp increase in _K_(_T_) just below T_{c} can be attributed to the formation of Cooper pairs. These pairs do not scatter phonons, thus the mean free path of phonons will increase and K_{p} is enhanced. As the temperature is lowered, however, the population of phonons is reduced and contributions such as point defects and boundary scattering become increasingly important, thus causing a fall off in _K_(_T_).

A fit to the data shown in Fig. 1(a) below 10 K gives a T2 behavior that has also been observed in polycrystalline YBa2Cu3O7 (Ref. 8) and single crystals YBa2Cu3O7, HoBa2Cu3O7 and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8.9-11 However, devia

  tions from a T^{2} dependence for K(T) has been reported for T\!<\!2 K in some polycrystalline YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8} samples. [1, 8] The numerous reports of a T^{2} dependence for K(T) as T\!\rightarrow\!0 for numerous high-T_{c} superconductors would suggest that this behavior of K(T) may be a common feature to all high-T_{c} superconductors. It is known that glassy materials shown an unusual T^{2} dependence in their thermal conductivity at low temperatures. [12, 13] This behavior has been attributed to the resonant scattering of phonon on two-level tunneling states which result from the tunneling of certain atoms or groups of atoms within a double-well potential. [14, 15] The same behavior of K(T) in high-T_{c} superconductors may indicate a similar mechanism is present.

It is known that in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+\delta}, T_{c} decreases with decreasing oxygen content eventually going to zero at \delta\!=\!0.4 where an orthorhombic-to-tetragonal structural transition occurs. This structure change with the concomitant change of the phonon spectrum [16] combined with a reduction of free charge carriers obviously impacts the behavior of K(T). In Fig. 2, we present K(T) vs T for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+\delta} for \delta\!\simeq\!1 and 0. The maximum in K(T) below T_{c} disappears in the deoxygenated nonsuperconducting sample as would be expected due to the reduction of free carriers and the absence of Cooper pairs. The magnitude also decreases consistent with our previous estimate of the charged carrier contribution to K(T). Since the phonon spectrum and phonon relaxation may change due to the changes in structure, this comparison may be fortuitous.

In order to extract electron-phonon coupling strengths and estimates of other parameters from K(T), we assume that it is dominated by phonon conduction and we fit our experimental K(T) data on the fully oxygenated compound using a TW theory, [5]

\[K_{p}(t) = At^{3}\int_{0}^{\infty}dx\frac{x^{4}e^{x}}{(e^{x}\!-\!1)^{2}}[1 + \alpha t^{4}x^{4}\!+ \beta t^{2}x^{2}\] (1) \[+ \gamma\nu\sigma(x,y)]^{-1}\ ,\]

where A, \alpha, \beta, and \gamma represent different phonon-scattering processes; boundary, point defects, sheetlike faults, and electrons, respectively. Here we assume that the electron conduction is a featureless, smooth function of T and only impacts our analysis through a slight altering of the fitted parameters.

A fit to K(T) using TW theory, i.e., Eq. (1), is shown in Fig. 1(a). From this fit, we obtain A\!=\!3.5, \alpha\!=\!80.8, \beta\!=\!43.9, and \gamma\!=\!54.1. Using the formula of Ref. 5, i.e.,

\[A = (4\pi/3)^{1/3}(2\pi)^{-1}(k_{B}^{2}\theta_{D}/\hbar a^{2})(T_{c}/\theta_{D})^{3}L_{b}\ ,\] (2) \[\gamma \simeq (\pi/2)(k_{B}T_{c}/T)(L_{b}/a)\lambda_{\ln}\ ,\] (3)

where a is the lattice constant, \theta_{D} is the Debye temperature, L_{b} is the mean free path for boundary scattering of phonons, T is the effective hopping matrix element for a two-dimensional tight-binding band of electrons, and \lambda_{\ln} is the coupling strength between electrons and longitudinal-acoustic phonons, we estimate the value of L_{b} to be \simeq20 \mum from Eq. (2) and \lambda_{\ln} to be \simeq0.04 from Eq. (3). In this estimation, we have used \theta_{D}\!=\!360 K, a\!=\!4 A, and T\!=\!5000 K. The value of L_{b} is consistent with the measured particle size determined from SEM measurements. The value of \lambda_{\ln} is consistent with the 0.03-0.08 reported by Peacor _et al._[17] on single crystals.

For selective doping by impurities that alter the superconductivity, the interesting features seen in K(T) and associated with superconductivity are dramatically modified. In Fig. 3(a), we present the normalized thermal conductivity, K(T)/K(180 K), vs T for Y_{1-\gamma}Pr_{2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} with y\!=\!0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4. The anomaly in K(T) at T\!\sim\!T_{c}/2 is suppressed with increasing Pr concentration. The compound with y=\!0.1 shows a small maximum in K(T) below T_{c}; however, no clear enhancement can be observed for y\!=\!0.2 and 0.4 which are still superconducting with T_{c}\!\simeq\!70 and 45 K, respectively.

Similar features in K(T) also appear in Zn-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, as illustrated in Fig. 3(b). Zn has almost the same radius as Cu (0.75 and 0.73 A, respectively) and the same ionic valence (+2); however, Zn has a filled 3d[10] shell, and it is nonmagnetic. The rapid depression of  with the substitution of Zn for Cu has been attributed to a localization of the Cu^{2+}d holes. This interpretation is supported by measurements of the electron-spin-resonance absorption and indirectly by transport, heat-capacity, and magnetization studies.[7] There is a small enhancement of K\left(T\right) below T_{c} for 1% Zn dopant, however, no clear maximum below T_{c} can be observed for 2% (or higher) Zn content which is still superconducting with a T_{c} \simeq 72 K. Further substitution of Cu with Zn does not dramatically affect the features of K\left(T\right). Although the mechanisms causing strong depression of T_{c} with Zn and Pr doping remain controversial and are probably different (one due to hybridization effects between Pr 4f electrons and conduction bands and the other due to the Cu^{2+}d holes localization), the impurity effects on K\left(T\right) for both Zn and Pr doping are quite similar. Even though the details of the pair-breaking or pair-weakening mechanisms may be different, the manifestation on fundamental properties, e.g., quasiparticle excitation spectrum and/or lifetimes, appears to be similar leading to the suggestion that there may be a common mechanism causing the strong depression of the enhancement of K\left(T\right) below T_{c}.

In order to more thoroughly explore the effect of impurities on the behavior of K\left(T\right) and determine that the observed change in K\left(T\right) for Zn and Pr doping is not due to a simple impurity-scattering mechanism and does reflect a global change of the excitation spectra, we have also measured K\left(T\right) of other samples in which the dopants are known to have little effect on T_{c}. It is well known that the transition temperature and magnetic ordering of Cu spins in Cu-O planes are essentially unchanged by substituting other rare-earth elements (except Ce, Tb, and Pr) into the Y sites in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. These rare-earth elements are believed to have a negligible exchange interaction between the carriers in the adjacent Cu-O planes which are intimately associated with the superconductivity and the 4f electrons, a high transition temperature (\sim 92 K) is thus maintained. A comparison of T_{c} vs doping concentration for Pr and Gd-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is shown in Fig. 4(a). The lack of sensitivity of T_{c} to rare-earth doping may imply these rare-earth elements do not alter other superconducting parameters, e.g., the energy gap or Cooper pair formation. We could thus expect that the substitution of Y by Gd would not dramatically affect the behavior of K\left(T\right) below T_{c}. This is indeed the case as shown in Fig. 5(a). Even with 70% Gd substitution, K\left(T\right) still sustains a clear and sharp maximum around T_{c} /2. This result is in contrast to that obtained for Pr-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and would indicate that the strong suppression of the maximum below T_{c} in K\left(T\right) with Pr doping must be associated with a change of other parameters, e.g., the energy gap and/or the electron-phonon coupling strength, than simply changes in the impurity scattering of the phonons.

Comparing K\left(T\right) for Al- and Zn-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, similar statements can be made relative to Zn-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. Unlike Zn, which seems to prefer to substitute on the Cu-O_{2} plane Cu sites,[18, 19] Al is believed to go to the Cu-O chain sites[18] and causes only a slight depression of T_{c} as seen in Fig. 4(b). We could therefore expect that the behavior of K\left(T\right) for the Al-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} would be similar to that of Gd dopants, i.e., giving less suppression of K\left(T\right) below T_{c}. In Fig. 5(b), we present K\left(T\right)/K\left(180\right) K vs T for 2 and 10 % Al-doped compounds. The obvious maximum at T_{c} /2 can still be observed even in the 10% Al-doped sample.

A comparison of the changes in K\left(T\right) for Pr- (Zn) and Gd- (Al) doped high-T_{c} superconductors suggests that the dramatic modification of K\left(T\right) for those impurities that depress T_{c} can not be simply related to changes in phonon-impurity scattering. Using the same fitting parameters for Eq. (1) as for a fully oxygenated sample, we note that if T_{c} is scaled from 93 to 70 to 50 K, the corresponding theoretical curves of K\left(T\right) vs T/T_{c} fall on a universal curve (Fig. 6). This indicates that if we introduce impurity dopants that just shift T_{c} and other con

  comitantly superconducting properties, e.g., gap, consistent with BCS theory, and the dopants do not strongly alter the relative contributions, then the maximum of _K_(_T_) below T_{c} should retain the same height as that of the pure sample and only shift in position. Thermal conductivity results on Pr- or Zn-doped specimens contrast strongly with the modeled _K_(_T_) assuming a "law of corresponding states" as shown in Fig. 6. Thus the changes in _K_(_T_) for Pr- and Zn-doped YBa2Cu3O7 must strongly alter the relative contributions and/or modify the simple BCS scaling between T_{c} and gap function. Certainly, if the electron-phonon interaction is significantly reduced due to small addition of impurities, the sensitivity of _K_(_T_) to the formation of a gap within the superconducting state would be diminished. Thus, if the electron-phonon interaction is "turned off," then within the TW theory the phonons do not "see" the gap. This is demonstrated in Fig. 7 where a reduction of the electron-phonon interaction leads to a rapid depression in the _K_(_T_) peak below T_{c}. In Fig. 7(a), we present a theoretical fit to a 1% Zn substitution, and in Fig. 7(b) a fit to 10% Pr dopant. Clearly, the TW theory can provide reasonable fits to our results if l is reduced, however, this appears to be an unsatisfactory explanation of the data because small levels of Zn and Pr would require substantial changes in the electron-phonon coupling. A further reduction in l would be required to explain the _K_(_T_) data for higher Zn and Pr doping.

A plausible explanation for the rapid suppression of the _K_(_T_) peak for dopants that diversely effect the pairing, i.e., Pr and Zn, is a rapid suppression of the quasiparticle gap with the reduction in T_{c} as predicted by Nagao _et al._20 A manageable way of simulating the rapid suppression of the gap or a smearing of the gap function with Zn or Pr doping is to use the TW theory with a reduced gap to T_{c} ratio, i.e., a reduction in _kh_=D(0)/D(0)Bcs. Shown in Fig. 8, the decrease of _kh_ can also reduce the enhancement of _K_(_T_) below T_{c}. In this figure, we employ the same fitting parameters obtained from the pure sample with _kh_=1.0 and vary _kh_ from 0.3 to 1.1. Obviously, the enhancement below T_{c} decreases with decreasing _kh_. There is no evidence of a maximum below T_{c} at _kh_=0.3, and this feature is quite similar to that observed in 20% Pr or 2% Zn substitution. One can therefore reduce _kh_ instead of l to achieve a good fit for the _K_(_T_) of Pr-doped compounds. The decrease of _kh_[D(0)/D_Bcs(0)] implies a more rapid depression of the energy gap that reflected by the reduced T_{c}(_x_). This suggestion is consistent with heat-capacity measurements in doped YBa2Cu3O7, e.g., Roth _et al._21 found that the specific jump D_C_ at T_{c} decreases very quickly with increasing Zn content. With 5% Zn substitution, D_C_ was completely suppressed. This strongly suggests that Zn-doped samples exhibit a tendency to gapless superconductivity. Phillips _et al._22 measured the specific jump D_C_ at T_{c} on Y1-_p_Pr_yBa2Cu3O7, finding that D_C_ decreases rapidly with increasing Pr concentration and with no clear D_C_ at T_{c} to be observed at y = 0.2. _D_C_/_T__c_ (~8 mJ/mol K2) of the 10% Pr dopant was only ~10% that of the pure sample. As mentioned earlier, Nagao _et al._20 have theoretically examined the effects of a nonmagnetic impurity on the energy gap of high-temperature superconductors using a spin-density-wave model.23 The re

  sults show that the impurity atoms suppress the superconducting energy gap \Delta_{\rm sc} below that predicted using a BCS model. More direct evidence of the gapless behavior in nonmagnetic impurity-doped high-T_{c} superconductors was provided by Akimenko _et al._[24] They have used point-contact spectroscopy to directly probe the energy gap of YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{7}, and observed a two-gap structure, \Delta_{\rm min} and \Delta_{\rm max}. Both \Delta_{\rm min} and \Delta_{\rm max} decrease with increasing Zn content with \Delta_{\rm min} being suppressed much faster than \Delta_{\rm max}.

The above theoretical and experimental results support suggestion that the rapid decrease of K\left(T\right) below T_{c} of Pr- or Zn-doped compounds originates from the suppression of the superconducting energy gap. This rapid depression of the gap as compared to that seen in conventional, low-T_{c} system may be related to the extremely short coherence length for the high-T_{c} systems as compared to low-T_{c} systems. These impurities coupled with the short coherence length may lead to a broadening of the electronic states on both sides of the energy gap resulting in a decrease of the gap and enhancement of K\left(T\right) below T_{c}. We therefore suggest that the decrease in superconducting gap causes the suppression of the enhancement of K\left(T\right) below T_{c} in Pr and Zn substitution. More experimental and theoretical work is necessary to clarify this conclusion, particularly on doped single crystals.

  K\left(T\right) below T_{c} dramatically and this can be ascribed to the reduction of superconducting energy gap. Contrary to Pr and Zn dopants, Gd and Al doping do not significantly affect the enhancement of K\left(T\right) below T_{c}. The superconducting energy gap and electron-phonon coupling strength are essentially sustained in these materials.

###### Abstract

The thermal conductivity K(T) of polycrystalline YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} with M=Zn and Al (0 \leqx\leq 0.1) and Y_{1-y},R_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} with R=Pr and Gd (0 \leqy\leq 1.0) has been measured for temperatures 1.2 \leqT\leq 200 K. In the pure material, K(T) decreases slightly with decreasing temperature above T_{c} and below T_{c} there is a strong enhancement of K(T) reaching a maximum at \sim 50 K followed by a sharp decrease. At temperatures below 10 K a T^{2} dependence is evident similar to behavior reported for amorphous systems with glasslike phonon scattering on the tunneling states. Doping with Zn or Pr rapidly depresses T_{c} and also depresses the maximum in K(T) even at concentrations that remain superconducting. This effect is observable to a lesser degree for the Al and Gd dopants. Comparisons between the K(T) behavior for impurities that do not depress T_{c} with those that diversely alter the superconducting properties are presented together with an analysis of the data using the Tewordt-Wolkhausen (TW) theory.

## I Introduction

Thermal conductivity has been extensively studied in high-T_{c} superconductors due to it advantage in probing the scattering processes of phonons and electrons in both normal and superconducting states. In addition, it can also provide invaluable information on the superconducting energy gap, excitation spectrum and lifetimes, and electron-phonon coupling parameters which are still being vigorously pursued by theorists and experimentalists in these materials.

There have been many reports [1] of thermal conductivity measurements in high-T_{c} superconductors, however, these studies have almost exclusively concentrated on pure polycrystalline and single-crystal samples with very few studies reporting on doped compounds. A common feature of K(T) for the high-T_{c} superconductors, e.g., YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} and Tl_{1}Ba_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta}, is a rapid rise with increasing T below T_{c}, reaching a maximum at approximately T_{c}/2 followed by a decrease and a sharp break in K(T) at T=T_{c}. [1] In sintered samples, this maximum is approximately 20% higher than the value of K(T) at T_{c}, and in single crystals the maximum may approach 100%. There have been several explanations proposed for this anomaly. For example, if the total thermal conductivity in the normal state is dominated by phonon conduction, and the phonons are significantly limited by electron-phonon scattering, then for T<T_{c}, Cooper pairs form and the number of electrons available to scatter phonons falls rapidly, resulting in an increase in the mean free path of the phonons and an enhancement in K(T). Such behavior has been seen in conventional superconductors, e.g., (Pb,Bi) alloys. [2] The electrical transport properties of these high-T_{c} layer oxide superconductors are extremely anisotropic and this anisotropy is also apparent in K(T). Hagen, Wang, and Ong [3] measured both the in-plane and out-of-plane K(T) from 10 to 330 K in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} crystals. They found that K_{c} [out-of-plane K(T)] is four to five times smaller and apparently does not have a maximum for T<T_{c}. However, K_{ab} [in-plane K(T)] does have a pronounced maximum. Using the measured electrical resistivity and the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law, the in-plane electronic contribution K_{ab}^{\ast} was estimated to be approximately 55% of the total K_{ab} above T_{c}. However, the K_{ab} of oxygen deficient, insulating YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} crystals shows a large phonon contribution, approximately the same magnitude as K_{ab} in superconducting crystals. These results have lead to a model where strong in-plane electron-phonon scattering in the normal state combined with an increase in the phonon lifetime due to a decrease in the quasiparticle scattering accounts for the strong enhancement of K(T) below T_{c} for superconducting samples. It is also suggested that the electron-phonon coupling strengths are extremely anisotropic. Alternate models have been proposed. Recently, Yu _et al._[4] measured the in-plane thermal conductivities in single-crystal YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and attributed the rapid rise in K(T) with decreasing T in the superconducting state to an electron (hole) contribution from the Cu-O plane, which increases rapidly below T_{c} due to the strongly suppressed quasiparticle scattering and concomitant increase of the quasiparticle, i.e., electron (hole), mean free path.

These explanations serve to illustrate the controversial nature of K(T) and the potential of it providing insight into the quasiparticle spectrum and lifetimes for these systems if a more definitive understanding of the T dependence of K(T) is established. The controversial nature of K(T) and its potential to provide indirect observations of quasiparticle parameters has driven our interest in extending these measurements to studies of impurity effects on the thermal conductivity. Such studies could lead to a greater insight into the relative contributions to K(T) and possibly indirect measurements of the quasiparticle spectrum within the superconducting state.

In this paper, we present the results of thermal conduc tivity _K_(_T_) measurements in selectively doped polycrystalline YBa2(Cu1-_x_M_x_)O7 with M = Zn and Al (0 <= x <= 0.1) and Y1-_y_R_yBa2Cu3O7 with R = Pr and Gd (0 <= y <= 1.0) for temperatures 1.2 <= T <= 200 K along with comparisons and a theoretical analysis of the data using the Tewordt-Wolkhausen (TW) theory.5

## II Experiment

Polycrystalline samples of composition YBa2(Cu1-_x_M_x_)O7 with M = Zn and Al (0 <= x <= 0.1) and Y1-_y_R_yBa2Cu3O7 with R = Pr and Gd (0 <= y <= 1.0) were prepared using standard solid-state reaction techniques.6,7 The final specimens were checked by x-ray diffraction for phase purity and preferred orientation. In addition, electrical transport and low-field magnetization was measured to better characterize the samples. These measurements have indicated that all samples used in this study were single phase with less than 2% impurities and had T_{c} vs x and y was consistent with previous studies.6,7 In addition, x-ray and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies have indicated that there was no preferred orientation in any of the sintered samples. Samples with a typical size of 1 x 2 x 10 mm3 were cut from pellets or directly made with a bar press. At several concentrations, numerous samples with different sample densities were prepared and measured to better define the impact of voids and particle size on _K_(_T_). These studies at different densities have indicated that the results to be presented within this paper are not an artifact of the ceramic nature of the samples, and provide some valuable insight to the intrinsic response of these very interesting systems.

The thermal conductivity was measured using a conventional four-probe heat-pulse method.1 A heater (metal film or resistor) was attached to one end of the sample while the other end was firmly epoxied (or soldered) to a variable temperature heat sink. The temperature gradient across the sample was measured using a differential chromel-constantan thermocouple for 25 <= T <= 250 K and a pair of calibrated carbon thermometers for T < 25 K. The temperature difference D_T_ during the measurements was typically between 0.3 and 1.0 K depending on the temperature of the sample.

## III Results and Discussion

In Fig. 1(a), we present _K_(_T_) for two fully oxygenated YBa2Cu3O7 polycrystalline samples with densities of 4.85 and 5.31 g/cm3. Ceramic samples typically have densities less than the theoretical value (~6.4 g/cm3) due to voids which may act as scattering centers for phonons and modify the measured _K_(_T_). Our results clearly show that the magnitudes of _K_(_T_) varies with density, however, the general features of _K_(_T_), i.e., the rapid increase of _K_(_T_) at T_{c} and the peak at T ~_T_c_/2, are quite similar. These common features can be more clearly observed by plotting the normalized thermal conductivity, _K_(_T_)/_K_(180 K), vs T as shown in Fig. 1(b). The _K_(_T_)/_K_(180 K) curves of different densities nearly overlap each other, indicating that the intrinsic temperature dependence of _K_(_T_) is given by the normalized _K_(_T_)/_K_(180 K) and this quantity is relatively insensitive to void density.

In the temperature range 100-180 K, _K_(_T_) is essentially temperature independent. At T = T_{c}, a sudden increase in thermal conductivity with decreasing T reaching a peak at T ~50 K is evident, with _K_(_T_) falling off at lower temperatures. These features are similar to those reported by other groups.1 We assume a conventional additive thermal conductivity arising from charge carriers, i.e., electrons (holes), and phonons, i.e., _K_(_T_)=_K_(_T_)+_K_(_T_). The charge carrier contribution to the _K_(_T_) can be roughly estimated using the WF law in conjunction with the measured electrical resistivity, i.e., K_{\ast} = L_{0}T/\rho, where L_{0} = 2.45 \times 10^{- 8} W O K-2 is the Lorentz number and r is the electrical resistivity. We find that K_{\ast}/K \leq 0.2 for both densities at T = 100 K. Even though such an estimate is crude and could be slightly in error, we take the position as most previous researchers have done that the dominant contribution to _K_(_T_) is due to phonon conduction. This position is consistent with other studies reported on _K_(_T_), however, as indicated earlier, it is not the only interpretation. Our analysis assuming that _K_(_T_) is dominated by phonon conduction is consistent with _K_(_T_) measurements of oxygen deficient, insulating samples (to be discussed) and a comparison to results for the superconducting samples.

Within these assumptions, the sharp increase in _K_(_T_) just below T_{c} can be attributed to the formation of Cooper pairs. These pairs do not scatter phonons, thus the mean free path of phonons will increase and K_{p} is enhanced. As the temperature is lowered, however, the population of phonons is reduced and contributions such as point defects and boundary scattering become increasingly important, thus causing a fall off in _K_(_T_).

A fit to the data shown in Fig. 1(a) below 10 K gives a T2 behavior that has also been observed in polycrystalline YBa2Cu3O7 (Ref. 8) and single crystals YBa2Cu3O7, HoBa2Cu3O7 and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8.9-11 However, devia

  tions from a T^{2} dependence for K(T) has been reported for T\!<\!2 K in some polycrystalline YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8} samples. [1, 8] The numerous reports of a T^{2} dependence for K(T) as T\!\rightarrow\!0 for numerous high-T_{c} superconductors would suggest that this behavior of K(T) may be a common feature to all high-T_{c} superconductors. It is known that glassy materials shown an unusual T^{2} dependence in their thermal conductivity at low temperatures. [12, 13] This behavior has been attributed to the resonant scattering of phonon on two-level tunneling states which result from the tunneling of certain atoms or groups of atoms within a double-well potential. [14, 15] The same behavior of K(T) in high-T_{c} superconductors may indicate a similar mechanism is present.

It is known that in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+\delta}, T_{c} decreases with decreasing oxygen content eventually going to zero at \delta\!=\!0.4 where an orthorhombic-to-tetragonal structural transition occurs. This structure change with the concomitant change of the phonon spectrum [16] combined with a reduction of free charge carriers obviously impacts the behavior of K(T). In Fig. 2, we present K(T) vs T for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+\delta} for \delta\!\simeq\!1 and 0. The maximum in K(T) below T_{c} disappears in the deoxygenated nonsuperconducting sample as would be expected due to the reduction of free carriers and the absence of Cooper pairs. The magnitude also decreases consistent with our previous estimate of the charged carrier contribution to K(T). Since the phonon spectrum and phonon relaxation may change due to the changes in structure, this comparison may be fortuitous.

In order to extract electron-phonon coupling strengths and estimates of other parameters from K(T), we assume that it is dominated by phonon conduction and we fit our experimental K(T) data on the fully oxygenated compound using a TW theory, [5]

\[K_{p}(t) = At^{3}\int_{0}^{\infty}dx\frac{x^{4}e^{x}}{(e^{x}\!-\!1)^{2}}[1 + \alpha t^{4}x^{4}\!+ \beta t^{2}x^{2}\] (1) \[+ \gamma\nu\sigma(x,y)]^{-1}\ ,\]

where A, \alpha, \beta, and \gamma represent different phonon-scattering processes; boundary, point defects, sheetlike faults, and electrons, respectively. Here we assume that the electron conduction is a featureless, smooth function of T and only impacts our analysis through a slight altering of the fitted parameters.

A fit to K(T) using TW theory, i.e., Eq. (1), is shown in Fig. 1(a). From this fit, we obtain A\!=\!3.5, \alpha\!=\!80.8, \beta\!=\!43.9, and \gamma\!=\!54.1. Using the formula of Ref. 5, i.e.,

\[A = (4\pi/3)^{1/3}(2\pi)^{-1}(k_{B}^{2}\theta_{D}/\hbar a^{2})(T_{c}/\theta_{D})^{3}L_{b}\ ,\] (2) \[\gamma \simeq (\pi/2)(k_{B}T_{c}/T)(L_{b}/a)\lambda_{\ln}\ ,\] (3)

where a is the lattice constant, \theta_{D} is the Debye temperature, L_{b} is the mean free path for boundary scattering of phonons, T is the effective hopping matrix element for a two-dimensional tight-binding band of electrons, and \lambda_{\ln} is the coupling strength between electrons and longitudinal-acoustic phonons, we estimate the value of L_{b} to be \simeq20 \mum from Eq. (2) and \lambda_{\ln} to be \simeq0.04 from Eq. (3). In this estimation, we have used \theta_{D}\!=\!360 K, a\!=\!4 A, and T\!=\!5000 K. The value of L_{b} is consistent with the measured particle size determined from SEM measurements. The value of \lambda_{\ln} is consistent with the 0.03-0.08 reported by Peacor _et al._[17] on single crystals.

For selective doping by impurities that alter the superconductivity, the interesting features seen in K(T) and associated with superconductivity are dramatically modified. In Fig. 3(a), we present the normalized thermal conductivity, K(T)/K(180 K), vs T for Y_{1-\gamma}Pr_{2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} with y\!=\!0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4. The anomaly in K(T) at T\!\sim\!T_{c}/2 is suppressed with increasing Pr concentration. The compound with y=\!0.1 shows a small maximum in K(T) below T_{c}; however, no clear enhancement can be observed for y\!=\!0.2 and 0.4 which are still superconducting with T_{c}\!\simeq\!70 and 45 K, respectively.

Similar features in K(T) also appear in Zn-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, as illustrated in Fig. 3(b). Zn has almost the same radius as Cu (0.75 and 0.73 A, respectively) and the same ionic valence (+2); however, Zn has a filled 3d[10] shell, and it is nonmagnetic. The rapid depression of  with the substitution of Zn for Cu has been attributed to a localization of the Cu^{2+}d holes. This interpretation is supported by measurements of the electron-spin-resonance absorption and indirectly by transport, heat-capacity, and magnetization studies.[7] There is a small enhancement of K\left(T\right) below T_{c} for 1% Zn dopant, however, no clear maximum below T_{c} can be observed for 2% (or higher) Zn content which is still superconducting with a T_{c} \simeq 72 K. Further substitution of Cu with Zn does not dramatically affect the features of K\left(T\right). Although the mechanisms causing strong depression of T_{c} with Zn and Pr doping remain controversial and are probably different (one due to hybridization effects between Pr 4f electrons and conduction bands and the other due to the Cu^{2+}d holes localization), the impurity effects on K\left(T\right) for both Zn and Pr doping are quite similar. Even though the details of the pair-breaking or pair-weakening mechanisms may be different, the manifestation on fundamental properties, e.g., quasiparticle excitation spectrum and/or lifetimes, appears to be similar leading to the suggestion that there may be a common mechanism causing the strong depression of the enhancement of K\left(T\right) below T_{c}.

In order to more thoroughly explore the effect of impurities on the behavior of K\left(T\right) and determine that the observed change in K\left(T\right) for Zn and Pr doping is not due to a simple impurity-scattering mechanism and does reflect a global change of the excitation spectra, we have also measured K\left(T\right) of other samples in which the dopants are known to have little effect on T_{c}. It is well known that the transition temperature and magnetic ordering of Cu spins in Cu-O planes are essentially unchanged by substituting other rare-earth elements (except Ce, Tb, and Pr) into the Y sites in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. These rare-earth elements are believed to have a negligible exchange interaction between the carriers in the adjacent Cu-O planes which are intimately associated with the superconductivity and the 4f electrons, a high transition temperature (\sim 92 K) is thus maintained. A comparison of T_{c} vs doping concentration for Pr and Gd-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is shown in Fig. 4(a). The lack of sensitivity of T_{c} to rare-earth doping may imply these rare-earth elements do not alter other superconducting parameters, e.g., the energy gap or Cooper pair formation. We could thus expect that the substitution of Y by Gd would not dramatically affect the behavior of K\left(T\right) below T_{c}. This is indeed the case as shown in Fig. 5(a). Even with 70% Gd substitution, K\left(T\right) still sustains a clear and sharp maximum around T_{c} /2. This result is in contrast to that obtained for Pr-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and would indicate that the strong suppression of the maximum below T_{c} in K\left(T\right) with Pr doping must be associated with a change of other parameters, e.g., the energy gap and/or the electron-phonon coupling strength, than simply changes in the impurity scattering of the phonons.

Comparing K\left(T\right) for Al- and Zn-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, similar statements can be made relative to Zn-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. Unlike Zn, which seems to prefer to substitute on the Cu-O_{2} plane Cu sites,[18, 19] Al is believed to go to the Cu-O chain sites[18] and causes only a slight depression of T_{c} as seen in Fig. 4(b). We could therefore expect that the behavior of K\left(T\right) for the Al-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} would be similar to that of Gd dopants, i.e., giving less suppression of K\left(T\right) below T_{c}. In Fig. 5(b), we present K\left(T\right)/K\left(180\right) K vs T for 2 and 10 % Al-doped compounds. The obvious maximum at T_{c} /2 can still be observed even in the 10% Al-doped sample.

A comparison of the changes in K\left(T\right) for Pr- (Zn) and Gd- (Al) doped high-T_{c} superconductors suggests that the dramatic modification of K\left(T\right) for those impurities that depress T_{c} can not be simply related to changes in phonon-impurity scattering. Using the same fitting parameters for Eq. (1) as for a fully oxygenated sample, we note that if T_{c} is scaled from 93 to 70 to 50 K, the corresponding theoretical curves of K\left(T\right) vs T/T_{c} fall on a universal curve (Fig. 6). This indicates that if we introduce impurity dopants that just shift T_{c} and other con

  comitantly superconducting properties, e.g., gap, consistent with BCS theory, and the dopants do not strongly alter the relative contributions, then the maximum of _K_(_T_) below T_{c} should retain the same height as that of the pure sample and only shift in position. Thermal conductivity results on Pr- or Zn-doped specimens contrast strongly with the modeled _K_(_T_) assuming a "law of corresponding states" as shown in Fig. 6. Thus the changes in _K_(_T_) for Pr- and Zn-doped YBa2Cu3O7 must strongly alter the relative contributions and/or modify the simple BCS scaling between T_{c} and gap function. Certainly, if the electron-phonon interaction is significantly reduced due to small addition of impurities, the sensitivity of _K_(_T_) to the formation of a gap within the superconducting state would be diminished. Thus, if the electron-phonon interaction is "turned off," then within the TW theory the phonons do not "see" the gap. This is demonstrated in Fig. 7 where a reduction of the electron-phonon interaction leads to a rapid depression in the _K_(_T_) peak below T_{c}. In Fig. 7(a), we present a theoretical fit to a 1% Zn substitution, and in Fig. 7(b) a fit to 10% Pr dopant. Clearly, the TW theory can provide reasonable fits to our results if l is reduced, however, this appears to be an unsatisfactory explanation of the data because small levels of Zn and Pr would require substantial changes in the electron-phonon coupling. A further reduction in l would be required to explain the _K_(_T_) data for higher Zn and Pr doping.

A plausible explanation for the rapid suppression of the _K_(_T_) peak for dopants that diversely effect the pairing, i.e., Pr and Zn, is a rapid suppression of the quasiparticle gap with the reduction in T_{c} as predicted by Nagao _et al._20 A manageable way of simulating the rapid suppression of the gap or a smearing of the gap function with Zn or Pr doping is to use the TW theory with a reduced gap to T_{c} ratio, i.e., a reduction in _kh_=D(0)/D(0)Bcs. Shown in Fig. 8, the decrease of _kh_ can also reduce the enhancement of _K_(_T_) below T_{c}. In this figure, we employ the same fitting parameters obtained from the pure sample with _kh_=1.0 and vary _kh_ from 0.3 to 1.1. Obviously, the enhancement below T_{c} decreases with decreasing _kh_. There is no evidence of a maximum below T_{c} at _kh_=0.3, and this feature is quite similar to that observed in 20% Pr or 2% Zn substitution. One can therefore reduce _kh_ instead of l to achieve a good fit for the _K_(_T_) of Pr-doped compounds. The decrease of _kh_[D(0)/D_Bcs(0)] implies a more rapid depression of the energy gap that reflected by the reduced T_{c}(_x_). This suggestion is consistent with heat-capacity measurements in doped YBa2Cu3O7, e.g., Roth _et al._21 found that the specific jump D_C_ at T_{c} decreases very quickly with increasing Zn content. With 5% Zn substitution, D_C_ was completely suppressed. This strongly suggests that Zn-doped samples exhibit a tendency to gapless superconductivity. Phillips _et al._22 measured the specific jump D_C_ at T_{c} on Y1-_p_Pr_yBa2Cu3O7, finding that D_C_ decreases rapidly with increasing Pr concentration and with no clear D_C_ at T_{c} to be observed at y = 0.2. _D_C_/_T__c_ (~8 mJ/mol K2) of the 10% Pr dopant was only ~10% that of the pure sample. As mentioned earlier, Nagao _et al._20 have theoretically examined the effects of a nonmagnetic impurity on the energy gap of high-temperature superconductors using a spin-density-wave model.23 The re

  sults show that the impurity atoms suppress the superconducting energy gap \Delta_{\rm sc} below that predicted using a BCS model. More direct evidence of the gapless behavior in nonmagnetic impurity-doped high-T_{c} superconductors was provided by Akimenko _et al._[24] They have used point-contact spectroscopy to directly probe the energy gap of YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{7}, and observed a two-gap structure, \Delta_{\rm min} and \Delta_{\rm max}. Both \Delta_{\rm min} and \Delta_{\rm max} decrease with increasing Zn content with \Delta_{\rm min} being suppressed much faster than \Delta_{\rm max}.

The above theoretical and experimental results support suggestion that the rapid decrease of K\left(T\right) below T_{c} of Pr- or Zn-doped compounds originates from the suppression of the superconducting energy gap. This rapid depression of the gap as compared to that seen in conventional, low-T_{c} system may be related to the extremely short coherence length for the high-T_{c} systems as compared to low-T_{c} systems. These impurities coupled with the short coherence length may lead to a broadening of the electronic states on both sides of the energy gap resulting in a decrease of the gap and enhancement of K\left(T\right) below T_{c}. We therefore suggest that the decrease in superconducting gap causes the suppression of the enhancement of K\left(T\right) below T_{c} in Pr and Zn substitution. More experimental and theoretical work is necessary to clarify this conclusion, particularly on doped single crystals.

  K\left(T\right) below T_{c} dramatically and this can be ascribed to the reduction of superconducting energy gap. Contrary to Pr and Zn dopants, Gd and Al doping do not significantly affect the enhancement of K\left(T\right) below T_{c}. The superconducting energy gap and electron-phonon coupling strength are essentially sustained in these materials.
