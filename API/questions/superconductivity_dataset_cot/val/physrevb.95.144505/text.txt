###### Abstract

We present structural, magnetic, electrical, thermal transport, Hall coefficient, and pressure-dependent resistivity measurements on Cu\({}_{x}\)ZrTe\({}_{2-y}\) compounds with \(x\) = 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, and 0.3, and \(y\) varied between 0 \(\leqslant\)\(y\)\(\leqslant\) 0.8. In order to calculate the ground state, _ab initio_ calculations of the electronic structure of these materials were performed. Our results show that copper intercalation in ZrTe\({}_{2}\) induces superconductivity in the ZrTe\({}_{2}\) system. For the Cu\({}_{0.3}\)ZrTe\({}_{1.2}\) sample, Hall and Seebeck coefficient measurements show that the system is predominantly negatively charged with carrier density close to 10\({}^{19}\) cm\({}^{-3}\). The temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient, the Seebeck coefficient, and the lower critical field indicates that this material presents multiband character. Pressure-dependent resistivity vs temperature measurements reveal that while the normal-state resistivity decreases with increasing applied pressure, the superconducting transition temperature is completely insensitive to the applied pressure (for pressure in the range 0-1.3 GPa). This suggests that the Fermi gas is intrinsically degenerate under very high pressure, and therefore does not change much with varying external pressure. Finally the band structure calculation shows a dispersion curve containing a bulk three-dimensional Dirac conelike feature at the \(L\) point in the Brillouin zone, which is gapless in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, but develops a gap when this coupling is considered. Altogether, the results indicate that the superconducting compound Cu\({}_{x}\)ZrTe\({}_{2-y}\) presents a signature of multiband behavior and may possibly be a new example of a topological superconductor.

## 1 Introduction

Layered transition-metal dichalcogenide compounds with general composition _MX\({}_{2}\)_ (_M_ = transition metal, and \(X\) = S, Se, or Te) display a large variety of physical properties. Some examples are NbSe\({}_{2}\), TaS\({}_{2}\), and TaSe\({}_{2}\), which have been thoroughly studied for their rich electronic properties [1, 2, 3, 4]. In these compounds, the transition-metal sheet is sandwiched between two similar chalcogen sheets. The interaction between these three-layer units has a van der Waals nature and hence is very weak. This particular characteristic creates a perfect environment for elemental intercalation that frequently results in significant modification of the properties [5, 6, 7, 8].

This change in behavior upon intercalation can be explained in terms of charge transfer between the intercalated (atoms or molecules) and the host _MX\({}_{2}\)_ layers. While the band structure remains unaltered upon intercalation, the density of states at the Fermi level changes, as described by the rigid-band model (RBM). The validity of this model is supported by photoemission experiments in various intercalated _MX\({}_{2}\)_ compounds [9, 10, 11, 12]. However, recent results with the intercalation of an organic molecule [(pyridine)\({}_{1/2}\)]TaS\({}_{2}\), and the alkaline metals Na and Cs intercalated in 2H-TaS\({}_{2}\) and VSe\({}_{2}\), suggest that the changes induced by intercalation were more extensive than that expected by the RBM [13, 14, 15, 16]. Some reports suggest that charge-density wave and superconductivity are distinctive quantum orders which can emerge from Fermi surface instabilities that frequently can be tuned upon intercalation [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28].

The objective of the present work is to investigate the properties of ZrTe\({}_{2}\), which crystallizes in the layered CdI\({}_{2}\)-type structure (space group \(P\)3_m_1). ZrTe\({}_{2}\) can be formed in a large stoichiometry range in the Zr-Te binary system, i.e., the phase (existing with a deficiency of Zr and/or Te within the same prototype structure) can accommodate a fairly wide range of deficiency of either element. In this paper we present evidence that copper intercalation in ZrTe\({}_{2}\) induces superconductivity with the signature of multiband behavior, and that it may possibly be a new example of a topological superconductor.

## 2 Experimental Procedure

Polycrystalline samples with Cu\({}_{x}\)ZrTe\({}_{2-y}\) compositions were prepared from the stoichiometric mixture of high-purity powders of Zr, Cu, and Te, with \(x\) = 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, and 0.3, and 0 \(\leqslant\)\(y\)\(\leqslant\) 0.8. The stoichiometric mixtures were ground thoroughly and pressed into pellets of 8.0 mm diameter and approximately 1.5 mm thickness. The pellets were encapsulated in quartz tubes under argon and heated at 850 degC for 48 h. After this heat treatment the samples were reground, pressed, and sealed in quartz again under the same conditions, soaked at 1000 degC for an additional 48 h, and then quenched in ice water, to avoid the formation of low-temperature phases (typically the ZrTe\({}_{3}\) phase). All samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD) in a PANalytical diffractometer (model Empyrean), with detector PIXcel\({}^{3\text{D}}\) using Cu _K\(\alpha\)_ radiation. Magnetic, electric, thermal, and Hall characterizations were made using a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). The Hall coefficient and carrier density were estimated using the van der Pauw technique [29]. The thermoelectric potential was measured using the PPMS's thermal transport option. The pressure dependence of the electrical resistivity of Cu0.3ZrTe1.2 in pressures up to 1.3 GPa was determined using a piston-cylinder self-locking cell, using silicone oil as the pressure-transmitting medium. The pressure at low temperatures was determined from the superconducting (SC) transition temperature of pure Pb.

## III Calculation methods

In order to obtain the ground-state electronic structure for the compound Cu2ZrTe2, _ab initio_ calculations were performed using the wien2k computational code [30] following the full-potential linear augmented plane wave plus local orbitals method [31], in the framework of the Kohn-Sham scheme [32] within the density functional theory [33]. Exchange and correlation effects were treated using the generalized gradient approximation using the parametrization due to Perdew _et al._[34], taking relativistic corrections and spin-orbit coupling into account. Muffin-tin radii (_R_MT) were taken as 0.106 nm for all nuclei, with a product _R_MT K max = 9.0, where _K_max is related to the basis set size. We used 10 000 \(k\) points in the first Brillouin zone. All lattice parameters and atomic positions were relaxed in order to guarantee a convergence in total energy within 10-5 Ry (=13.6 x 10-5 eV) in the self-consistent procedure. It should be noted that we assumed that all Cu crystallographic positions were filled by copper nuclei, so that the stoichiometry of the calculated compound is Cu2ZrTe2.

## IV Results and discussion

The equilibrium phase diagram of the Zr-Te binary system shows six binary compounds. Among them, the ZrTe2 is an equilibrium phase with stoichiometry composition between 33 and 43 at. % zirconium [35]. ZrTe2 crystallizes with hexagonal CdI2-type structure (space group \(P\)3_m_1) [36], shown schematically in the inset of Fig. 1, with Cu atoms already intercalated into the structure of the compound. The zirconium atoms occupy the (0,0,0) atomic positions, while the tellurium atoms occupy the (1/3,2/3,1/4) positions, with the layers in the stacking sequence Zr-Te-Te-Zr. The weak van der Waals bonds between the Te layers are amenable to an interlayer intercalation. In this work we studied the effect of copper intercalation. Figure 1 shows the Rietveld refinement for experimental x-ray diffraction data of a Cu0.3ZrTe2 sample. The refinement was carried out using the powderedll[37], vesta crystallography [38], and expqui-gas[39] codes.

The agreement between experimental and simulated spectra is excellent and the refinement provided error parameters such as goodness-of-fit (\(\chi^{2}\)) and weighted-profile reliability factor (_R_wp) of 1.61% and 8.71%, respectively. The refinement demonstrates that the copper atoms used in the sample preparation were incorporated in the ZrTe2 structure. The inset in Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the probable sites where the copper intercalation may happen. The XRD structural refinement yielded for the lattice parameters of the intercalated compound Cu0.3ZrTe2 the values \(a=3.959\) A and \(c=6.656\) A, slightly higher than the values for pure ZrTe2, which is consistent with intercalation.

  field of 25 Oe strongly suggests bulk superconductivity at critical temperature \(T_{c}\approx 9.7\) K. Magnetization versus applied magnetic field at 2.0 K is shown in the upper inset of Fig. 2, and it is possible to observe a type-II superconducting response. This data is in agreement with electrical resistivity data, shown in Fig. 2(b), in which it is possible to observe a metal-like behavior down to 9.7 K. At this point we observe a sharp superconducting transition (\(\Delta T_{c}\sim 1.2\) K) that has the \(T_{c}\) suppressed with applied magnetic field. Samples with other compositions were also prepared. Cu\({}_{0.3}\)ZrTe\({}_{2}\) also shows the superconducting transition close to 10.0 K. However, the superconducting volume is small (data not shown) even though the x-ray diffraction pattern reveals a single-phase sample. The small magnitude of the magnetic shielding suggests that the superconductivity in this sample is not bulk. Our investigations were conducted for several Cu and Te compositions and the best results were found in the Te-deficient samples with Cu content of \(x=0.3\). We point out the fact that pure ZrTe\({}_{1.2}\) samples, with Te deficiency with respect to the ZrTe\({}_{2}\) composition, do not exhibit a superconducting transition, showing instead a metal-insulator transition (data not shown). This is an indication that the superconductivity is triggered by the presence of the Cu layers.

Figure 3 shows the upper critical field \(H_{c2}\) phase diagram for samples with composition of Cu\({}_{0.3}\)ZrTe\({}_{1.2}\). The \(H_{c2}\) vs \(T_{R}\) (where \(T_{R}\) is the reduced temperature defined by \(T/T_{c}\)) phase diagram was constructed using the superconducting transition midpoint from the resistivity measurement shown in Fig. 2(b). In general, in the dirty limit most authors use the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula [40] given by

\[\mu_{0}H_{c}(0)=-0.693T_{c}\left(\frac{dH}{dT}\right)_{T_{c}}.\] (1)

Using the derivative close to \(T_{c}\) in Eq. (1) allows us to estimate the upper critical field at zero Kelvin. However, a strong deviation from the expected WHH theory (dashed red line) behavior can be clearly observed in Fig. 3. This kind of deviation could suggest a multiband manifestation in this material, similar to what occurs in many materials that are recognized as multiband such as MgB\({}_{2}\), LaNiC\({}_{2}\), or ThCoC\({}_{2}\)[41, 42, 43].

The Seebeck coefficient does not depend on the electron effective mass, and with this goal we did the measurements of this important parameter as a function of temperature (2-300 K) for a Cu\({}_{0.3}\)ZrTe\({}_{1.2}\) sample, as shown in Fig. 4. The thermoelectric potential drops to zero near \(T_{c}\), consistent with a bulk superconducting state observed in Fig. 2. The predominance of \(n\)-type carrier is consistent with the Hall effect measurement, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4. The Hall effect measurement as a function of temperature shows a negative charge-carrier density decreasing linearly with increasing temperature, which is an unusual behavior for a metallic material. The linear dependence in the Seebeck coefficient at low temperature also allows an estimation of the carrier density using the _ST_ rate, and is consistent with the Hall effect measurements. This set of results (Seebeck and Hall effects) demonstrates that the carrier density is very low, and once again indicates the possibility of the superconductivity being due to topological effects arising from the copper doping. In contrast to the Cu-induced superconducting topological material Cu\({}_{0.12}\)Bi\({}_{2}\)Se\({}_{3}\)[27], where the Hall coefficient is independent of temperature, the linear temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient observed in Cu\({}_{0.3}\)ZrTe\({}_{1.2}\) suggests that more than one band contributes to the Fermi surface since this behavior requires more than one relaxation time. Indeed the linear dependence of the Hall voltage on temperature is a signature of multiband behavior, which has been observed in compounds such as MgB\({}_{2}\), fullerenes, and some organic materials [39, 40, 41, 42, 43]. The obtained \(n\) values are close to \(10^{19}\) cm\({}^{-3}\), which is much smaller than values found normally in metals.

Another unusual behavior observed in Cu\({}_{0.3}\)ZrTe\({}_{1.2}\) compound is in the lower critical field (\(H_{c1}\)). \(H_{c1}\) can be estimated from the applied magnetic field dependence of the magnetization by determining the point of departure from linearity of the magnetization curve at low field. Thus, the

  dependence of the magnetization on the applied field (_M_ vs \(H\) curves) was measured at several temperatures, as shown in Fig. 5.

It is observed that the deviation from linearity in \(M\) vs \(H\) curves occurs at magnetic fields, below 15 Oe. These results provide a London penetration depth estimate of about 0.5 _m_m, which is about 100 times larger than conventional superconductors and is consistent with the very low carrier concentration. The inset of Fig. 5 shows the temperature dependence of the lower critical field. The _H_c1 vs \(T\) phase diagram displays an unusual nonmonotonic behavior. This behavior (_H_c1 vs _T_) is also observed in materials that are considered multiband compounds [44-54], like in MgB2 with holelike boron \(s\) band and \(p\) band structure [54]. These results are also consistent with the interpretation of multiband character obtained from the carrier density in the Hall coefficient results shown in Fig. 4. These sets of results extracted from Figs. 4 and 5 are completely consistent and strongly suggest a multiband behavior in this new superconducting material.

Figure 6 shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity as a function of the applied pressure in the range of 0-1.3 GPa, for the sample with composition Cu0.4ZrTe1.2. Although presenting a slightly lower transition temperature (_T_c onset near 9.0 K) and a wider superconducting transition width compared to the Cu0.3ZrTe1.2 sample, it is surprising the superconducting transition temperature _T_c is completely insensitive to applied pressure while the normal-state resistivity drops noticeably with pressure. This behavior indicates that phonons are sensitive to applied external pressure. However, an explanation for why the superconducting state does not respond to applied pressure is not so obvious, but it may be that it corresponds to an intrinsically degenerate Fermi gas under very high pressures, and therefore does not change much with varying external pressure. We conclude that this kind of behavior can be intrinsic of the topological superconductivity and these results offer evidence for that.

Indeed, the band structure calculation shown in Fig. 7 reveals some interesting characteristics and suggests the presence of a topologic effect in this copper intercalated material. Figure 7(a) shows the band structure calculations for

The inset shows the _H_c1 vs \(T\) phase diagram, showing an unusual behavior with a slope change close to 60% at the critical temperature.

  Cu2ZrTe12 without spin-orbit coupling (SOC), where we can observe a dispersion curve similar to a bulk three-dimensional (3D) Dirac cone at the \(L\) point in the Brillouin zone, with zero gap, as well as two less-pronounced features around the \(H\) point (highlighted with ellipses). However, when SOC effects are considered, these features are gapped [Fig. 7(b)]. This kind of behavior also occurs in graphene at the \(K\) point in the Brillouin zone [55] and also in a few compounds, such as Bi14Rh3In9 [56]. This signature suggests that the SOC, being topologically nontrivial, gaps this single Dirac cone at the \(L\) point. Besides, although the compound is metallic, there is a continuous gap around the Fermi energy when SOC is considered. Indeed similar behavior can be observed in other topological materials such as the noncentrosymmetric superconductor PbTaSe2[57]. Taken together with the experimental results for applied pressures, discussed above, the band structure calculations strongly suggest that Cu4ZrTe2-7 can represent a new example of a superconductor with nontrivial topological effects.

## V Conclusion

In this work we showed results about a systematic study of the properties of the Cu2ZrTe12 compound, which indicate that copper intercalation in the ZrTe2 host induces a superconducting behavior with a critical superconducting temperature close to 9.7 K, as revealed through magnetization and resistivity measurements. The charge-carrier density varies with temperature suggesting multiband behavior in this new material. The charge-carrier density is low (10\({}^{19}\) cm\({}^{-3}\)), which suggests that this material is an \(n\) semimetal consistent with the electronic structure calculations. These results are completely consistent with different measurement techniques such as Hall effect and Seebeck coefficient. The low charge-carrier density suggests that the observed superconducting behavior comes from topological effects, as also suggested by the band structure calculation. Indeed, the band calculation strongly points to a nontrivial topological effect revealed by the 3D Dirac conelike feature at the \(L\) point in the Brillouin zone. Pressure-dependent resistivity vs temperature measurements reveal that the normal-state resistivity decreases with increasing applied pressure, while the superconducting transition temperature is completely insensitive to the applied pressure (0-1.3 GPa). This suggests that the Fermi gas is intrinsically degenerate under very high pressures and therefore does not change much with varying external pressure. The set of results demonstrate that this material could be another example of a topological superconductor with multiband effect.
