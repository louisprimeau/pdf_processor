###### Abstract

Structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of undoped and aliovalent-ion (Ca, F)-doped LaFePO, which undergo superconducting transitions at transition temperatures (\(T_{c}\)) 4-7 K [Y. Kamihara _et al._, J. Am. Chem. Soc. **128**, 10012 (2006)], were investigated. \(T_{c}\) of the samples varied from 2.4 to 5.5 K in the undoped samples and was increased up to \(\sim\)7 K by Ca and \(F\) doping. The \(T_{c}\) increases are correlated with a decrease in the lattice volume. LaFePO exhibits paramagnetism in the normal conducting state. Photoemission spectroscopy combined with first-principle band calculations clarified that Fe Fe 3\(d\) (\(d_{2,2}\)+(\(d_{2,c}\),\(d_{3,2}\))) orbitals hybridized with P 3\(p\) to form a Fermi surface. The band calculations also suggest that the 3\(d\) electron of the Fe in LaFePO is basically in the low-spin configuration, and that the spin moment of LaFePO is almost quenched, leading to the paramagnetism of the itinerant electrons.

## I Introduction

In addition to various types of copper-based oxide superconductors [1, 2], several superconductors that contain a noncopper transition metal element as a major constituent, such as Na\({}_{2}\)CoO\({}_{2}\cdot\)1.3H\({}_{2}\)O, Na\({}_{2}\)V\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{5}\), Cu\({}_{x}\)TiSe\({}_{2}\), and LnNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (Ln= Y, Tm, Er, Ho, or Lu), have recently been reported [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moreover, a considerable number of iron-based compounds have been reported as exhibiting superconductivity, including intermetallic compounds [U\({}_{6}\)Fe, Th\({}_{7}\)Fe (Refs. 7 and 8)], iron silicates [\(R_{2}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{8}\), \(R\)= Sc, Y, Lu, and Tm (Refs. 9 and 10)], and rare-earth-filled skutterudites [LnFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\), Ln = La,Y (Refs. 11 and 12)], whose transition temperatures (\(T_{c}\)) range from 1.8 to 7 K. All of these compounds show Pauli paramagnetic behavior in the normal conducting states, indicating that the magnetic moments of the irons are quenched. The quench of the magnetic moment is also observed in a high-pressure phase of elementary iron \(\varepsilon\)-Fe, which shows a superconducting transition at \(\sim\)2 K [13]. We have recently found that LaFePO exhibits metallic conduction near room temperature and undergoes a superconducting transition at \(\sim\)4 K [14], providing a new compound system to the iron-based superconductors.

LaFePO is a member of the LnT\({}_{M}\)PnO family, where Ln represents a 4\(f\) rare-earth element, \(T_{M}\) is a transition metal element with a more than half-filled 3\(d\) shell, and \(Pn\) is a pnicogen element. These compounds belong to the tetragonal \(P4/mmm\) space group [15, 16, 17, 18], and the unit cell containing two chemical formula units is represented by (La\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\))(Fe\({}_{2}\)P\({}_{2}\)). This crystal has a layered structure composed of an alternate stack of LaO and FeP layers (Fig. 1). A Fe ion is coordinated with four P ions to form a distorted Fe\({}_{4}\) tetrahedron, which is linked with neighboring FeP\({}_{4}\) tetrahedra in an edge-sharing manner to comprise the FeP layer. From the facts that iron monophosphate (FeP) exhibits metallic conduction [19], and the Cu \(Ch\) layers in LaCu\(Ch\)/\(Ch\) (\(Ch\) = S, Se), which are isostructural compounds to LaFePO, form hole transport paths [20, 21], we expected that the FeP layer in LaFePO would also form a carrier conduction path. Such a structure, in which the carrier conduction layer is sandwiched by the wide-gap LaO layers, may be regarded as a multiple-quantum well (MQW) embedded in the crystal structure [20]. Therefore, strong electron-electron interaction is expected, owing to the two-dimensional carrier confinement in the FeP layers. In addition, the composition of LaFePO tends to deviate from the stoichiometry primarily because it contains two different anions with different charge state. This nonstoichiometry involving O/P vacancies and/or antisites may also alter the carrier density around the Fermi surface, possibly inducing a

 significant change in \(T_{c}\). Further, aliovalent ion doping may be more effective in altering the density of states responsible for the superconductivity. It is worth noting that the electromagnetic properties of La_T_M_PO drastically change with the number of 3\(d\) electrons, i.e., an antiferromagnetic semiconductor for Mn (3_d_[5]),22 a ferromagnetic metal for Co (3_d_[7]),22 a superconductor for Ni (3_d_[8]),23 and a semiconductor for Zn (3_d_[10]).24 It should be noted that a family compound, LaFeAsO, exhibits superconductivity at much higher temperatures up to 26 K upon \(F\) doping to the oxygen ion sites.25\(T_{c}\) of the _F_-doped LaFeAsO shifts up to 43 K upon applying high pressure.26 It makes the Ln_T_M_PO family recognized as a new high \(T_{c}\) superconductors. After these publications, many preprint papers on LnFeAsO (Ln=lanthanide ions) have been reported during the review process of this paper.27

In this study, we have performed x-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility measurements on LaFePO, LaFeP(O\({}_{0.9\text{,}}\)F\({}_{0.06\text{,}}\)), and (La\({}_{0.9\text{,}}\)Ca\({}_{0.1}\))FePO. It was clarified that \(T_{c}\) of undoped LaFePO ranged from 2.4 to 5.5 K, which correlated with the lattice parameters. Moreover, it was observed that the _F_-ion doping increased \(T_{c}\) up to 7 K. Further, electronic and magnetic structures were examined by photoemission spectroscopy (PES) with the aid of first-principles band calculations. Here, we employed soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPES) with an excitation energy of 701.24 eV and hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HXPES) with a higher excitation energy of 7936.06 eV, which may make it possible to assign origins of PES signals because a photo-ionization cross-section of electron depends on the photon energy and atomic orbital of electron.

## II Experiment

Several samples were prepared for nominally undoped, _F_-doped, and Ca-doped LaFePO. All of the samples were polycrystalline and prepared via the following solid-state reactions. Zimmer _et al._15 reported a synthesis route for LaFePO. However, different routes were employed in this study to obtain higher-purity samples. We used dehydrated La\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) and a mixture of compounds, which is composed of LaP, Fe\({}_{2}\)P, and FeP (LaP-Fe\({}_{2}\)P-FeP powder), as starting materials. To obtain the LaP-Fe\({}_{2}\)P-FeP powder, La (Shinetsu Chemical; La with purity 99.5 mol%, containing Ce 0.33 mol%, Pr 0.01 mol%, Nd 0.06 mol%, Fe 0.22 mol%, etc.), Fe (Kojundo Chemical; >99.9%), and P (Rare Metallic Chemical; 99.999%) were mixed in a ratio of 1:3:3 and heated at 700 degC for 10 h in an evacuated silica tube. La\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) was dehydrated by heating commercial La\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) powder (Kojundo Chemical; 99.99%) at 600 degC for 10 h in air. Then, a 1:1 mixture of LaP-Fe\({}_{2}\)P-FeP powder and the La\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) powder was heated in an evacuated silica tube at 1200 degC for 40 h to prepare undoped LaFePO. \(F\) doping was performed by replacing a part of La\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) with a 1:1 mixture of LaF\({}_{3}\) (Morita Chemical; 99%) and La metal in the starting materials for undoped LaFePO. Ca-doped LaFePO was synthesized by heating a mixture of FeP (prepared by heating a 1:1 mixture of Fe and P at 1000 degC for 10 h in an evacuated silica tube), dehydrated CaO (prepared by heating commercial CaCO\({}_{3}\) powder (Kojundo Chemical; 99.99%) at 920 degC for 10 h in air), and the starting materials for undoped LaFePO in an evacuated silica tube at 1250 degC for 40 h. For the final reactions, the silica tubes were filled with high-purity Ar gas under 0.2 atmospheric pressure at room temperature to prevent collapse of the silica tubes. The Ar pressure in the tube was expected to prevent the evaporation of volatile components in the mixture, resulting in the formation of the near-stoichiometric LaFePO.

All of the samples were subjected to powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrical resistivity measurements. Three samples (one of each was chosen from the undoped, the _F_-doped, and the Ca-doped samples, denoted as "representative samples" hereafter) were used for the other measurements. The crystallographic phases were characterized by XRD (Rigaku RINT-2500) using Cu _Ka_ radiation. Lattice parameters were obtained by a least-squares fitting method using the diffraction angles collected in the 2_th_ range from 30 to 120deg, and corrected them with an external reference method using a reference-grade Si powder (NIST SRM 640c).

Electrical resistivity measurements were conducted at 2-300 K using a dc four-probe technique. Magnetization was measured on the representative samples using a quantum design physical properties measurement system (PPMS) with a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) option at 2-370 K. Core-level and valence-band structures were measured by HXPES (_hv_ = 7936.06 eV; total energy resolution \(\Delta\)_E_, which was estimated from the Fermi-edge broadening of an Au reference, was less than 250 meV) and SXPES (_hv_ = 701.24 eV; \(\Delta\)_E_ was approximately 130 meV) at 20 K on the undoped LaFePO used for the magnetization measurements. These spectra were respectively measured at BL29XU (Refs. 28-30) and BL23SU31 beam-lines of SPring-8. Spin-polarized first-principles band calculations were performed based on the linearized augmented plane wave plus local orbitals (L/APW+lo) method at the density-functional theory (DFT) level using PBE96 functionals with the code WIEN2k.32 GGA+\(U\) calculations were also performed to examine the effect of interactions in Fe 3\(d\) electrons, with effective Coulomb parameters (_U-J_) varied in the range of previously reported values from 0 to 6 eV.33-36

## III Results

### Structural characterization

Figure 2 shows the powder XRD patterns of the representative samples of undoped, Ca-doped, and _F_-doped LaFePO. Almost all of the diffraction peaks are assigned to those of the LaFePO phase, indicating that the LaFePO phase is dominant in all of the samples, although there are several weak peaks attributable to FeP, LaP, and LaOF (indicated by arrows in the figure). Peak intensities of the impurity phases relative to those of LaFePO are less than 3% for FeP, 4% for LaP, and 3% for LaOF, suggesting that the impurity contents are at these levels in all of the samples. It should be noted that the detection limit of our XRD measurements is ~0.1 mol %,37 which suggests that magnetic measurements can detect more trace impurities compared to those detected

 by the XRD measurements. In fact, our magnetization measurements indicated that a ferromagnetic impurity Fe\({}_{2}\)P (Ref. [38]) was often involved in the \(F\)-doped LaFePO; however this was not detected in the XRD pattern. However, these impurities do not provide significant influence on the following superconductivity characterizations because it has been confirmed that they do not show superconductivity down to 2 K.

The XRD measurements have shown that lattice parameters exhibit non-negligible scattering (i.e., larger than the experimental errors, \(\Delta a\)=0.00004 nm and \(\Delta c\)=0.0002 nm) even for the same nominal composition samples (the data will be shown in Fig. 9 in comparison to \(T_{c}\)). The undoped LaFePO shows the scattering with \(a\)-axis lengths of \(a\) = 0.3962 +- 0.0001 nm (the latter figure shows the scattering range of the \(a\)-axis length) and \(c\)-axis lengths of \(c\) = 0.8511 +- 0.0002 nm. The Ca-doped samples have similar \(a\)-axis lengths \(a\) = 0.3961 +- 0.0001 nm, while \(c\)-axis lengths are \(c\) = 0.8516 +- 0.0004 nm, which are larger than those of the undoped LaFePO. The \(F\)-doped samples have much smaller \(a\)-axis lengths and the smallest \(c\)-axis lengths, with the scattering in the \(c\)-axis length (\(a\) = 0.3957 +- 0.0001 nm, \(c\) = 0.8503 +- 0.0004 nm). Such scatterings in the lattice parameters may be due to deviations in the chemical compositions because it is difficult to eliminate a trace deviation from the stoichiometry for multinary compounds such as LaFePO, even when synthesized in closed silica tubes. In spite of the scattering, there is a clear trend that the \(a\)-axis lengths of the Ca-doped and the \(F\)-doped LaFePO, on average, are smaller compared to those of undoped samples by \(\sim\)0.03 and \(\sim\)0.13%, respectively. Since the ionic radius [39] of Ca\({}^{2+}\) (0.112 nm) is smaller than that of La\({}^{3+}\) (0.116 nm), and that of F-(0.131 nm) is smaller than that of O\({}^{2-}\) (0.138 nm) for the same coordination number, the shrinkage of the \(a\)-axis lengths in the Ca-doped and \(F\)-doped LaFePO suggests that Ca\({}^{2+}\) and F\({}^{-}\) substitute La\({}^{3+}\) and O\({}^{2-}\), respectively.

### Electrical properties

Figure 3 shows the temperature (\(T\)) dependences of the electrical resistivity (\(\rho\)) for the undoped (upper), Ca-doped (middle), and \(F\)-doped LaFePO (lower) samples. Insets show expanded \(\rho\)-\(T\) curves in the temperature range below 15 K. The thick \(\rho\)-\(T\) curves correspond to those of the representative samples used for the magnetization measurements in the next section (note that these representative samples are employed in Figs. 2 and 4-7). All of the samples show metallic conduction in the normal conducting state. With decreasing temperature, sharp drops in \(\rho\) to zero, which are more clearly visible in the insets, are observed at low temperatures. These drops are attributed to superconducting transitions, as confirmed by the magnetization measurements (Sec. III.3). Superconducting transition temperatures (\(T_{c}\)) hereafter are defined as a temperature where \(\rho\) takes a half value of the resistivity at 15 K (\(\rho_{15\rm K}\)). It is observed that both the \(T_{c}\) and \(\rho_{15\rm K}\) vary among the samples in a wide range. For instance, \(T_{c}\) ranges from 2.4 to 5.5 K among the undoped samples, even though they were prepared in apparently the same conditions.

Steep increases at \(T\)\(<\)20 K are due to paramagnetic impurities (e.g., Ce\({}^{3+}\)). Curie paramagnetic susceptibilities are calculated as C/T, (\(C\)=1.1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\)  emu K/mol, \(\sim\)0.14 mol % of Ce\({}^{3+}\)). The \(X_{\rm mol}\) curves are obtained by subtracting the Curie paramagnetic susceptibilities from the measured \(M_{\rm mol}\)/\(H\) curves.

### Magnetic properties

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependences of the magnetization (_M_mol) of the representative samples of (a) undoped, (b) Ca-doped, and (c) _F_-doped LaFePO measured at a magnetic field of 10 000 Oe. _M_mol gradually increases with decreasing temperature and then sharply increases with a further decrease at temperatures below ~20 K. The sharp increase is attributable to the impure paramagnetic ions included in the La metal source. For instance, the sharp increase region follows the Curie paramagnetic equation _X_mol = _C_/_T_ with \(C\) = 1.1 x 10-3  emu K/mol. The \(C\) value corresponds to ~0.14 mol % of Ce3+, which can be understood as the involvement of 0.42 mol% Ce in the La metal source. Temperature dependences of the molar magnetic susceptibility [thicker lines (_X_mol) in Figs. 4(a)-4(c)] originating from the LaFePO phase are extracted by subtracting the contributions of the Curie paramagnetic susceptibility. The _X_mol values of all of the samples show a steep decrease at <5 K.

In the normal conducting states (e.g., at >10 K), the _X_mol values are small and show weak temperature dependences, indicating that the samples contain no magnetic ions, or that the magnetic moments of the ions are very small. Therefore, paramagnetism of itinerant electrons is dominant in the normal conducting states, although Van Vleck paramagnetism due to orbital moments and the more negligible core electron diamagnetism may contribute to the observed susceptibility.

Figure 5 shows _M_mol-_H_ curves for the undoped, Ca-doped, and _F_-doped LaFePO at 2 K. The inset shows an expanded view of the curves in the small \(H\) region. _M_mol decreases as \(H\) increases from 0 Oe and then increases when H exceeds threshold values (indicated by arrows in the insets of Fig. 5). The threshold values are regarded as lower superconducting critical fields (_H_c1). The _H_c1 values vary between 20 and 50 Oe and are comparable to those reported on other transition-metal-based superconductors having similar _T_c such as Na2CoO2 H2O and Cu0.07TiSe4 (_H_c1 = 10-30 Oe). [40, 41] The _M_mol-_H_ curves become almost linear at magnetic fields >10,000 Oe, indicating the gradual disappearance of diamagnetic shielding and paramagnetism becoming dominant at >_H_c1. The slopes of the _M_mol-_H_ curves are -0.65, -1.48, and -3.08 for the undoped, Ca-doped, and _F_-doped samples, respectively, in a magnetic field region from zero to _H_c1. These values are close to the perfect diamagnetic susceptibility (dashed line in the inset of Fig. 5), indicating that the negative magnetizations are due to the Meissner effect, and the volume fractions of the superconducting phases calculated from the slopes are 20%, 46%, and 97% for the undoped, Ca-doped, and F-doped samples, respectively. These volume fractions, which are safely larger than those of the above impurity phases, substantiate the superconductivity being due to the LaFePO phase. Magnetizations of the F-doped LaFePO samples often exceed the perfect diamagnetization below _H_c1 because demagnetization effects overestimate superconducting volume fractions in diamagnetic-shielding measurements. [42] The steep decreases of _X_mol values at ~5 K observed in Fig. 4 indicate the growth of superconducting volumes with decreasing temperature.

The inset shows expanded _M_mol-_H_ curves near _H_c1 (indicated by arrows). The dashed line indicates the magnetization of the perfect diamagnetism (_M_mol = -3.20 H for Ca-doped and _F_-doped LaFePO).

### Photoemission spectra

#### iii.4.1 Fe 2p3x2,1/2 core spectra: hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy

The chemical bonding nature of LaFePO was examined from the chemical shifts of Fe 2\(p\) peaks in HXPES. The undoped LaFePO was selected for this study to avoid effects of the dopant. Figure 6 shows a HXPES spectrum of the representative undoped LaFePO sample with binding energies ranging from 700 to 730 eV, where two peaks due to Fe 2\(p\)3_2 and 2\(p\)1/2 are observed. The binding energy of Fe 2\(p\)3_2 (~706.8 eV) is similar to those of Fe metal [43] and Fe-P inter-metallic compounds [FeP (Ref. [44]] and LaFe4P12 (Ref. [45])]. On the other hand, it is distinctly different from those of FeO (Ref. [46]) and FeS2,[35] suggesting that the Fe-P chemical bond in LaFePO has less of an ionic nature and is more likely to be metallic or covalent.

#### iii.4.2 Valence band spectra: hard and soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy

Figure 7 shows HXPES (a) and SXPES (c) spectra of the undoped LaFePO with binding energies from 0 to 20 eV. The energy is measured from the Fermi energy. The Shirley method [47] is employed to remove the backgrounds, and their intensities are normalized with the most intense band D around 17 eV, which is assigned to La 5\(p\)3/2 and 5\(p\)1/2, as discussed later. The Fermi edge is clearly observed both in the HXPES and SXPES spectra, which is consistent with the metallic conduction of LaFePO. In addition to band D, the spectra show three distinct bands: A, B, and C. Band A, which is at the Fermi edge, is much stronger in the SXPES spectrum compared to that in the HXPES spectrum, and band B is also enhanced in the SXPES spectrum compared to that in the HXPES spectrum. On the other hand, the intensities of band C are similar to each other in HXPES and SXPES, although its peak position in the HXPES spectrum is at a larger binding energy compared to that in the SXPES spectrum. The assignment of these bands is discussed with the results of band calculations in Sec. IV.3.

## IV Discussion

### Correlation of transition temperature with crystal structure spectroscopy

As mentioned in Sec. III.2, we observed that both the _T_\({}_{c}\) and the \(r\)15 K of undoped LaFePO vary widely, e.g., _T_\({}_{c}\) ranges from 2.4 to 5.5 K even though the preparation conditions were apparently the same (Fig. 3). Further, the doping of Ca and F ions enhances _T_\({}_{c}\). Here, we discuss the possible parameters, such as the carrier density at the Fermi level (_D_E) and lattice parameters, which control _T_\({}_{c}\).

As suggested by the theory of metals, conductivity is expected to be proportional to _D_E, provided that the carrier mobility remains unchanged. However, it is difficult to obtain _D_E values experimentally, and therefore, \(r\)15 K values in Fig. 3 are employed as a measure of _D_E with a supposition that the carrier mobility does not change with the chemical composition in LaFePO. The _T_\({}_{c}\) values of the undoped, Ca-doped, and _F_-doped LaFePO samples are plotted against \(r\)15 K in Fig. 8. There is a good correlation between _T_\({}_{c}\) and \(r\)15 K in the each sample with the same nominal compositions. However, _T_\({}_{c}\) decreases with increasing \(r\)15 K in the undoped LaFePO, but it increases in the doped LaFePO samples. This result implies that the carrier density (and possibly _D_E) is not the dominant factor for controlling _T_\({}_{c}\) in the case of the undoped and the aliovalent ion-doped LaFePO samples.

Figures 9(a)-9(c) show the _T_\({}_{c}\) values of all of the samples as functions of the lattice parameters \(a\) and \(c\), and the unit cell volume (_V_), respectively. _T_\({}_{c}\) shows a trend to increase with decreasing \(c\) and \(V\), while it is hard to find a systematic variation in _T_\({}_{c}\)-_a_ curve. The changes in the lattice parameters in these LaFePO samples would be due to deviations in the chemical compositions. Therefore, the _T_\({}_{c}\) variation is also related to the compositional deviation. On the other hand, in addition to the nonstoichiometry, the doping of the aliovalent ions shows a different trend in the _T_\({}_{c}\)-lattice parameters compared to the undoped sample. This may reflect the fact that the variations in the carrier density (i.e., _D_E) with the lattice parameters differ between the aliovalent ions-doped LaFePO and the undoped LaFePO. In other words, "chemical pressure" would have different effects on _T_\({}_{c}\) in these LaFePO. It should be noted that the _T_\({}_{c}\) is more widely varied with the lattice parameters in the undoped samples than in the doped ones.

### Valence band structure

HXPES core spectrum (Fig. 6) suggests that the Fe-P chemical bond is more likely to be covalent (or metallic).

Figure 8: (Color online) Superconducting transition temperature (_T_\({}_{c}\)) versus \(r\)15 K for undoped (black circles), Ca-doped (red triangles), and _F_-doped (blue squares) LaFePO. Solid lines are guides for the eyes.

Figure 9: (Color online) Superconducting transition temperature (_T_\({}_{c}\)) versus lattice parameters \(a\) (a) and \(c\) (b), and unit cell volume (_V_) (c) for undoped (black circles), Ca-doped (red triangles), and _F_-doped (blue squares) LaFePO. Solid lines are guides for the eyes.

 Here, we discuss the electronic states at the Fermi surface in more detail from the valence band photoemission spectra (Fig. 7). It is known that HXPES has a high sensitivity to an \(s\) electron, a moderate sensitivity to a \(p\) electron, and a low sensitivity to a \(d\) electron,[48] whereas SXPES exhibits an opposite tendency. Therefore, the stronger intensities of bands A and B in the SXPES spectrum compared to the same in the HXPES spectrum in Fig. 7 suggest that these bands have larger portions of \(p\) or \(d\) electrons. In addition, the intensity of band A relative to that of band B is larger for SXPES, suggesting that the \(d\) electron states are incorporated in band A. This suggestion, together with the expectation that the FeP layer acts as a conduction path, tentatively allows us to conclude that the Fermi surface is composed of the hybridized orbitals of Fe 3\(d\) and P 3\(p\).

### Calculated band structure

To further explore the Fermi surface, we performed spin-polarized first-principles energy band calculations to obtain the projected density of states (PDOS). It should be noted that the self-consistent field (SCF) cycles performed in these calculations converged to two similar but different states for LaFePO. Therefore, strict convergence criteria (0.00001 Ry for energy convergence and 0.0001 electrons for charge convergence) were adopted, and the ground state was judged from the SCF total energy.[49] Figure 10 shows the PDOS calculated for ideal LaFePO crystal with _U-J_=0. The calculated total DOS in Fig. 10 reproduces well the experimental PES spectra in Fig. 7, although the calculated DOS peaks are inevitably shallower than the PES peaks.[50] It shows that LaFePO has no energy gap, showing metallic nature. It also shows that the _U-J_=0 eV band structure of LaFePO is slightly spin-polarized with a spin moment of 0.11_m_\({}_{B}\) per Fe ion. It should be noted that there is a striking difference in calculated spin moment per Fe ion between LaFePO (0.11_m_\({}_{B}\)) and LaOFeAs (2_m_\({}_{B}\)).[51] To confirm that this result was not affected by incorporation of electron correlation, GGA+_U_ calculations were performed with the _U-J_ values varied up to 6 eV for Fe 3\(d\) electrons. These calculations provided similar spin-polarized metallic bands, even though the details of the PDOSs were different, and the spin moments increased from 0.11 to 0.63_m_\({}_{B}\) per Fe ion with increasing _U-J_ value. This result confirms the present conclusion (i.e., the slightly spin-polarized metallic state) does not depend on electron-electron correlation in Fe 3\(d\) electrons. As noted in Fig. 4, the magnetic measurements indicate that the magnetic moments are almost quenched in LaFePO. However, we observed paramagnetic behavior, and the paramagnetic behavior was weakly temperature dependent. It is difficult to discriminate the observed behavior from the small magnetic moments suggested in the calculations, and therefore the calculation results do not contradict the observations. Hereafter, we will employ the up-spin PDOS with _U-J_=0 for comparison to the experimental PES spectra because the selection of the _U-J_ parameter does not change the PDOS structure to a great extent, and the polarization is small, as explained above. The up-spin PDOSs (Fig. 11) shows that Fe 3\(d\) orbitals widely spread in the valence band region (note that the Fermi energy is at 0 eV), and they overlap with P 3\(p\) orbitals. In addition, Fe 3\(d\) orbitals have non-negligible hybridization with P 3\(s\) (Ref. [44]) around 11 eV, whose energy corresponds to band C in Figs. 7(a) and 7(c). In fact, the intensities of band C are mainly due to P 3\(s\) in HXPES and Fe 3\(d\) in SXPES, which lead to the shift in the peak position discussed in Sec. III.4.2. The calculated PDOSs also show that band A is assigned to the states composed of Fe 3\(d\) and P 3\(p\), band B to those of O 2\(p\) and P 3\(p\), and band D to those of La 5\(p\) and O 2\(s\). Figures 7(b) and 7(d) illustrate the PES spectra schematically by considering that the photoelectron yields are larger for SXPES compared to that for HXPES by the ratio of 1:10:60 for _s:p_:_d_ electrons, respectively.

Figure 12 shows the up-spin PDOSs decomposed to irreducible expressions for the atomic orbitals in the muffin-tin spheres defined for the _L_/ APW+lo calculation. Because the Fe site in LaFePO has point group symmetry of \(D\)2_d_, the Fe 3\(d\) levels are split into three nondegenerated, \(A\)1 (_d_z_), \(B\)1 (_d_x2_,_y2_), and \(B\)2 (_d_x_), and a doubly degenerated \(E\) (_d_z_,_d_yz_) representations. It is clearly observed in Fig. 12(a) that the distribution of P 3\(p\) is similar to that of Fe 4\(s\), although Fe 4\(s\) shows significantly smaller PDOS compared to that of P 3\(p\). Similarly, Fe 4\(p\) shows significantly smaller PDOS compared to that of P 3\(p\). Regardless of the small contributions, these facts suggest that P 3\(p\) and Fe 4\(s\) form bonding orbit

  als. The P 3\(p\) levels are split into two irreducible representations, i.e., a nondegenerated _p_z and a doubly degenerated (_p_z,_p_y), in a tetragonal lattice. As shown in Fig. 12(a), P 3_p_z has non-negligible contributions around the Fermi energy, whereas the contribution of 3(_p_z,_p_y) is negligible, indicating that P 3_p_z contributes mainly to the Fermi surface. It is also shown that the Fe 3\(d\) levels further split into bonding and antibonding levels by forming hybridized orbitals with ligand P 3\(p\) orbitals [representative peak positions are indicated by vertical bars in Fig. 12(b)]. This result shows that the Fe 3\(d\) levels are roughly classified into two groups: the higher-energy (3_d_z2,y2 and 3_d_z2) and the lower-energy (3_d_xy and 3[_d_xz,_d_yz]) group. The inset of Fig. 12(b) shows that the Fermi surface is composed of P 3_p_z, Fe 3_d_z2, and Fe 3(_d_xz,_d_yz), indicating that these orbitals form the carrier transport paths and are responsible for the superconductivity. Figure 13 illustrates a simplified energy diagram built from these results.

We now comment on the quantitative value of the density of state at _Ef_(_D_Ef) in LaFePO. The _L_/APW+lo calculation gave us the _D_Ef value of 3.4 states/eV per unit cell. On the other hand, when the Van Vleck paramagnetism and core state diamagnetism can be neglected, assuming that paramagnetic susceptibility can be explained by _kh_Pauli=_kh_0(1 + _c_T_2), [52] where \(c\) is a constant and _kh_0 is the susceptibility at zero temperature, an experimental _D_Ef estimated from the _kh_mol value of undoped LaFePO at 20 K was 18 states/eV per unit cell. This value is six times larger compared to that of the _L_/APW+lo calculation. This enhancement is consistent with the result obtained by the heat capacity measurements. [53] Such an enhancement suggests that spin fluctuation dominates the magnetic properties of the present materials. [54]

## V Conclusions

(1) LaFePO is a superconductor with a transition temperature (_T_c) of 2.4-5.5 K. The observed _T_c variation is presumably due to changes in the lattice parameters and /or carrier density caused by the compositional deviation from stoichiometry. Aliovalent ion doping of Ca or F increases the value of _T_c up to 7 K. A linear correlation was found between the _T_c increase and unit cell volume; however, the increase in the undoped samples is larger compared to that in the doped samples.

(2) The temperature-dependent magnetization indicates that the magnetic moment in LaFePO is almost quenched, while spin-polarized first-principles energy band calculations suggest the presence of small (\(\sim\)0.11 \(\mu_{B}\)/Fe) but finite spin moments at the ground state. This is compatible with the experimental results, suggesting that LaFePO exhibits a paramagnetic behavior with the weakly temperature-dependent _kh_mol in the normal conducting state.

(3) The photoemission spectra, together with the calculated PDOSs, clarify that the Fermi surface in LaFePO is primarily constituted from Fe 3\(d\) orbital. The participation of P 3\(p\) orbital hybridizing with Fe 3\(d\) orbitals remains \(\sim\)10%. These results verify that the present material is a Fe-based superconductor. Fe 3\(d\) electrons, which are itinerant in the overlapped orbitals of Fe 3_d_z2, Fe 3(_d_xz,_d_yz) and P 3_p_z, are responsible for the superconductivity and paramagnetism. Refs. [55, 56, 57] were added during the correction of the proofs for this paper.
