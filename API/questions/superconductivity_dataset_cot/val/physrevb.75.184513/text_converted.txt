## I Introduction

Recently reported superconductivity in magnesium diboride (MgB₂) at ∼40
K, highest for an intermetallic compound, [1] has resulted in intensive
investigations both theoretically and experimentally to exploit the
possible superconductivity at higher than 40 K for practical
applications, and to understand the underlying mechanisms of the normal
and superconducting states of this system. [2, 3, 4, 5] The structure of
MgB₂ is a simple hexagonal AlB₂ type with honeycomb-type boron layers
and interpenetrating Mg layers. [3] It has been well established that it
is a multiband, namely σ and π, and conventional s-wave phonon mediated
BCS-type superconductor. [3] The two bands and the respective
superconducting gaps are associated with different parts of its Fermi
surface. [4] It is believed that the σ-band is of hole type and is
mainly responsible for the superconductivity in MgB₂ whereas the π-band
is an electron type with comparatively negligible contribution. [4] In
spite of the fact that MgB₂ is one of the simplest binary compounds with
a simple crystal structure, some of its physical, chemical, and
electrical properties are very intriguing and not yet fully understood
even after numerous investigations. [5]

Chemical substitution, like in other superconductors, serves as a useful
tool to modify the structure and other physical properties of MgB₂ to
study the underlying mechanism of superconductivity and improve some of
its important parameters for practical applications. To explain the
variations observed in T_(C) upon different substitutions, so far
various mechanisms, such as pair breaking effect, reduction in density
of states (DOS), decrease in phonon frequency, and band narrowing or
expansion due to increase and/or decrease in the lattice constants
and/or disorder have been proposed. [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] For example, the
reduction in T_(C) with Al substitution for B has been attributed to the
decrease in DOS at E_(F) due to the electron doping in the σ-band. [11,
12] Moreover, a sharp drop in T_(C) has been reported for the
substitution of magnetic element such as Mn, while a different
mechanism, spin-flip scattering and/or pair breaking effect has been
proposed to the observed T_(C) variation. [13, 14] On the other hand,
another magnetic element Fe had shown much slower variations in T_(C) in
comparison with Mn (Refs. [8, 15, and 16]) and such a diverse variation
between Fe and Mn has been attributed to the nonmagnetic nature of Fe in
Mg lattice. [17] The major setback with such substitutional studies is
the limitation in the solubility of the third element at the Mg and/or
at the B site, [18] except for aluminum (Al) and carbon (C), [11, 19]
which can be readily substituted at Mg and B sites, respectively.
Nevertheless, other elements show successful substi tution at Mg/B sites
only if their concentration is below 5

Among the transition metal substitutes attempt-ed.[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20,
21, 22] Fe substitution in MgB₂ behaves in a unique way and is of
particular importance from the application viewpoint.[2] In terms of
applications, metal cladding on MgB₂ or for any superconducting wire is
the most important part vis-a-vis the critical current density. A recent
report has revealed that Fe can be a potential candidate as a practical
cladding metal or as a diffusion barrier for MgB₂ wire fabrication.[2]
Recent NMR investigations on Fe substituted MgB₂ have revealed that the
density of states close to the Fermi level remains nearly unaffected
upon its substitution up to 3

## III III. Results and Discussion

### A. Electrical resistivity

The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity ρ(T) of the
Mg_(1 − x)Fe_(x)B₂ alloys (x=0.00−0.03) is shown in Fig. 1(a). From
these measurements we obtain the superconducting transition temperature
in a way described by Osofsky _et al.[25]_ These values of T_(C),
presented in Table 1 and plotted in the inset of Fig. 1(a), are found to
be consistent with the magnetization measurements.[23] While the
transition has been very sharp (less than 0.2 K) for the pristine
sample, significant transition broadening ΔT_(C) could be noticed with
increasing Fe content (ΔT_(C)∼ 2 K for x=3

Figure 1: (a) The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity ρ(T) of
Mg_(1 − x)Fe_(x)B₂ alloys for x=0.00−0.03. The solid lines are fit for
the experimental data with Eq. (3). Inset, superconducting transition

squares) as a function of Fe concentration. (b) The slope dρ/dT (50−300
K).

present case. It is worth mentioning that the residual resistivity (RR)
ρ₀ obtained from the measurements appears to increase with increasing Fe
substitution [see Table 1 and inset of Fig. 1(a)]. Similar to that of
the T_(C) variation, the dependence of RR deviates from linearity at x =
1.2

Resistivity in MgB₂ can be considered as the outcome of the scattering
processes of carriers of σ and π bands with defects (point defects,
sheetlike faults, dislocations, etc.), impurities (Fe, etc.) and
phonons. In fact, according to Lue _et al._[23] there is no magnetic
moment on Fe in the Mg_(1 − x)Fe_(x)B₂ samples. Thus we do not expect
the presence of any electron-spin scattering process in the system. The
resistivity ρ_(b) due to the combined scattering of the carriers of the
σ and π bands with defects, impurities, and phonons is given by

ρ_(b)(T) = ρ_(def, b) + ρ_(imp, b) + ρ_(ph, b)(T).
(1)

Here ρ_(def, b) and ρ_(imp, b) are temperature-independent resistivities
due to the scattering of b-band electrons by defects and impurities,
respectively. The quantity ρ_(ph, b) in Eq. (1) is the resistivity due
to scattering of b-band electrons by phonons. ρ_(ph, b) is temperature
dependent and is, in general, given by the Bloch-Gruneisen expression
[27]

$$\rho_{\mathrm{ph},b}=A_{b}(m-1)\,\theta_{D}(T\,\theta_{D})^{m}\!\!\int_{0}^{ \theta_{D}/T}\!\!\frac{z^{m}}{(e^{z}-1)(1-e^{-z})}dz.$$
(2)

Here A_(b) depends on the band parameters via
$A_{b}\!\!=\!\frac{A_{b}\nu_{F,b}}{\omega_{F,b}}$. A₀ is independent of
band specifications, and of m and θ_(D) (Debye temperature). ν_(F, b) is
the Fermi velocity and ω_(p, b) is the plasma frequency both
corresponding to the band b. We have obtained this dependence of A_(b)
on ν_(F, b) and ω_(p, b) by considering Eq. (7.63) of Ziman.[28]
According to Ref. [29] the values of ν_(F, b) and ω_(p, b) for MgB₂ are
ν_(F, σ)  =  2.4 × 10⁵ m/s, ν_(F, π) = 5.63 × 10⁵ m/s, ω_(p, σ)  =  2.27
eV, and ω_(p, π)  =  6.19 eV. The overall resistivity ρ(T) of the system
due to the contribution of the σ and π bands is given by [30]

$$\frac{1}{\rho(T)}=\frac{1}{\rho_{\sigma}(T)}+\frac{1}{\rho_{\pi}(T)}.$$
(3)

From this equation the residual resistivity is given by

$$\rho_{0}=\frac{\rho_{0,\sigma}\rho_{0,\pi}}{(\rho_{0,\sigma}+\rho_{0,\pi})},$$
(4)

where [24]

$$\rho_{0,b}=\frac{\gamma_{b}}{\varepsilon_{0}\omega_{p}^{2}}.$$
(5)

Here γ_(b) is the sum of the scattering rates of the b-band carriers
with the impurity and defects. ε₀  =  8.85 × 10⁻¹² F/m is the free space
permittivity. Using the above expressions along with the values of
ν_(F, b) and ω_(p, b) we have fitted the experimental data with Eq. (3)
in terms of the parameters γ_(σ), γ_(π), A₀, m, and θ_(D) for various
samples of Mg_(1 − x)Fe_(x)B₂. The values of these fitting parameters
are tabulated in Table 1. An excellent fitting of Eq. (3) to the
experimental data has been achieved with these parameters.

From Table 1 we see that γ_(σ)  < γ_(π) for all the considered samples.
This is what we expect from the work of Mazin _et al._[30] From the
values of γ_(σ) and γ_(π) for x = 0.0 we estimate the contributions of
the σ and π carriers to the residual resistivity. We obtain,
ρ_(def, σ)  =  44.3μΩ cm and ρ_(def, π)  =  25.6μΩ cm. For x > 0,
ρ_(0, b) is the direct sum of the values of the resistivities due to
defects (ρ_(def, b)) and impurities (ρ_(imp, b)). That is to say

ρ_(0, b) = ρ_(def, b) + ρ_(imp, b).
(6)

Another information that we can draw on the basis of Table 1 is that the
temperature dependence of ρ(T), as signified by the values of m and
θ_(D), varies nonmonotonically with increasing x. This is because the
uncertainties in the fitting of the values of m and θ_(D) are much less
than the difference in the values of m or θ_(D) for different x. For
example, 100[m(x  =  0.0) − m(x  =  0.003)]/m(x   =  0.0) = 15.9% is
much larger than the 2.0

In order to gauge such a nonmonotonic variation of m with the Fe content
we consider the m dependence of ρ(T). Following Eqs. (2) and (3) we
obtain the following form of the slope dρ/dT as
s=(dρ/dT)=(T/θ_(D))^(m − 1)^(m + 2) (T→ 0). The first term
(T/θ_(D))^(m − 1) decreases sharply with m as (T/θ_(D))≪ 1 for T→ 0, in
contrast to the second factor m^(m + 2) which increases with m. However,
the variation of m^(m + 2) is relatively much slower. For example,
taking T = 10 K, θ_(D)=10³ K, (T/θ_(D))^(m − 1) decreases by a factor of
10⁴ while the factor m^(m + 2) increases only by 256 for m increasing
from 2 to 4. This implies that for low T(T→ 0) the variation of the
slope s is dominated by the factor (T/θ_(D))^(m − 1). Since
(T/θ_(D))^(m − 1) decreases with increasing m, s will also decrease with
m. In Fig. 1(b) it is the slope of the x=0.3

### Thermal conductivity

The temperature-dependent thermal conductivity κ(T) data of the various
Fe-substituted MgB₂ samples are presented in Fig. 2. The absence of any
hump in κ below T_(C) (inset of Fig. 2) agrees well with the reported
κ(T) data.[21, 27] It would be appropriate to mention here that the data
in Fig. 2 has been shifted by different amounts for the sake of clear
qualitative depiction. For x=0, the thermal conductivity κ(T) shows a
shoulder near 110 K. Other groups have also observed a shoulder in κ for
the pristine sample.[21, 27] With increasing x the shoulder near T∼ 110
K becomes weaker and eventually fades away for the 3.0

We may write the total thermal conductivity of MgI_(x)-Fe_(x)B₂ as
composed of two parts–the first ($\kappa_{\rm el}$) is the electronic
contribution due to conduction electrons and the second
($\kappa_{\rm ph}$) is the lattice contribution due to the phonons. That
is to say,

$$\kappa=\kappa_{\rm el}+\kappa_{\rm ph}.$$
(7)

The electronic contribution $\kappa_{\rm el}$ may be expressed in terms
of the dc resistivity ρ(T), Eq. (3), by using the Wiedemann-Franz
law[31]

$$\kappa_{\rm el}=\frac{L_{0}T}{\rho(T)}.$$
(8)

L₀ being the Lorenz number.

From Eqs. (7) and (8) we have found that at any given temperature the
lattice contribution to the experimental thermal conductivity follows
the relation

$$\kappa_{\rm ph}(x^{\prime},T)<\kappa_{\rm ph}(x^{\prime\prime},T)\quad{\rm for }\ x^{\prime}<x^{\prime\prime}.$$
(9)

Here x^(′), x^(′)=0.0, 0.003, 0.006, 0.012, and 0.03.

Since ρ(T) involves contributions from both σ and π bands of MgB₂,
$\kappa_{\rm el}$ also involves contributions from these two bands. The
phonon contribution $\kappa_{\rm ph}$, however, has nothing to do with
the electronic bands σ and π and is entirely contributed by the lattice.
In general, we may express the lattice thermal conductivity
$\kappa_{\rm ph}$[32]

$$\kappa_{\rm ph}(T)=t^{3}\int_{0}^{\theta_{D}T}\frac{z^{4}}{(e^{z}-1)(1-e^{-z} )K(t,z)}dz.$$
(10)

Here t=T/T_(C) is reduced transition temperature, and K(t, z) is the sum
of the scattering rates of phonons due to different scattering sources.
From the inset of Fig. 2 we see that there is no hump in κ below T_(C).
Thus, according to Ref. [32] we do not consider the scattering of
phonons by electrons in K(t, z). There are then four main sources of
phonon scattering events which we feel are important in deciding the
values of $\kappa_{\rm ph}$ in MgB₂. They are (1) grain boundaries in
the sample, (2) point defects, (3) strain fields of sheetlike faults,
and (4) strain fields of dislocations. We thus write[32]

$$K(t,z)=K_{0}+K_{\rm pd}t^{2}z^{4}+K_{\rm sf}t^{2}z^{2}+K_{\rm dis}tz.$$
(11)

Here K₀ is the boundary scattering rate, $K_{\rm pd}$ is the scattering
rate of phonons from the point defects, $K_{\rm sf}$ is the scattering

Figure 2: The temperature-dependent thermal conductivity for
MgI_(x − x)Fe_(x)B₂ alloys (x=0.00−0.03). The solid lines are fit for
the experimental data with Eq. (7). The inset (10−50 K) is to clarify
that there is no hump in κ below T_(C)∼ 39 K. The data is shifted by
various amounts for clear vision.

rate from sheetlike faults, and $K_{\rm dis}$ is the scattering rate
from dislocations.

In order to maintain a consistency of our analysis we have used those
values of θ_(D) in Eq. (10) which we have obtained from ρ analysis
(Table 1). The fitting parameters K₀, $K_{\rm pd}$, $K_{\rm sf}$, and
$K_{\rm dis}$ are given in Table 11. These parameters do not follow a
monotonic variation with x. The main reason for this is that the
residual resistivity ρ₀ is not linear in x, and that the temperature
dependence of ρ(T) is also nonmonotonic (cf. values of m in Table 1).
Despite this we find from Table 2 that the parameters K₀ and
$K_{\rm pd}$ vary with x in a manner to oppose each others’ effect.
Then, for x≤0.012, the decrease of $K_{\rm sf}$ and $K_{\rm dis}$ with
increasing x may be understood as a process for the relation of Eq. (9).
In view of Eq. (9) the overall coupling of the phonons with defects
and/or Fe decreases with increasing x. From the viewpoint of Table 2, up
to x=0.012 the shoulder appears due to the dominance of the reduction of
the effects of the boundary scattering (K₀) and dislocations
($K_{\rm dis}$) over the effect of the point defects ($K_{\rm pd}$). For
the 3.0

Although, the parameters of Table 2 do not show a systematic variation
with x, according to Eq. (10) their combined effect, or equivalently the
combined effect of defects and Fe, becomes weaker for phonons with
increasing x. This situation is different from that of the interaction
of phonons with electrons as evidenced from the variations of parameters
A₀ and m in Table 1. The variations of A₀ with x means that the
electron-phonon interaction is strongest for the x=0.003 sample,
decreasing a little with further substitution.

### Seebeck coefficient

The temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficient S(T) of the
Mg_(1 − x)Fe_(x)B₂ alloys with various x is shown in Fig. 3. Each curve
is offset by 1 μV/K for clarity. For the presently investigated
Mg_(1 − x)Fe_(x)B₂ samples, the common features observed in Seebeck
coefficient, such as the positive sign, the small magnitude at 300 K,
the linear variation between T_(C) to ∼150 K (solid lines and arrows in
the figure), and the tendency to saturate at higher temperatures are in
well accordance with the behavior widely reported for MgB₂.[11, 22, 23,
33, 34] The transition temperatures determined from the Seebeck
coefficient measurements are generally consistent with the electrical
resistivity measurements for these Mg_(1 − x)Fe_(x)B₂ alloys. The
notable observation of the present results of Seebeck coefficient
measurements is that the variations in S(T) in the normal state are
nearly composition independent, which is significantly in contrast to
the general behavior observed by other substituents in MgB₂.[11, 22, 24,
34] Fe is a trivalent element and effectively an electron dopant.
Besides, one can expect a slight band broadening due to the increase in
the lattice compression as the lattice parameters of Mg_(1 − x)Fe_(x)B₂
alloys decrease monotonically with the Fe concentration. Electron doping
and the band broadening generally lead to a systematic decrease in DOS
around E_(F) in MgB₂. Further, recently reported Seebeck coefficient
measurements on Al substituted MgB₂ have correlated the changes in E_(F)
to the observed systematic variations in the slope of S(T) between T_(C)
to 200 K,[11] where the value of E_(F) is related to the slope of
temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficient through the classical formula

$$\frac{S}{T}=\frac{\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}}{3eE_{F}},$$
(12)

assuming a one-band model with an energy-independent relaxation time.
Some of the other transition elements like Co and Cr have shown
significantly large and systematic variations in the magnitude of
normal-state Seebeck coefficient upon their substitution and such
variations have been attributed to the reduction in DOS.[21, 22] As a
nonmagnetic trivalent element, one would expect that Fe should show a
similar effect as Al substitution, which in turn must reduce the DOS in
holelike σ-band by electron doping and the electronic topological
transition of the Fermi surface from two to three

dimensional.[35] Such changes in the electronic structure can change the
magnitude and as well the sign of S dramatically. However, as shown in
the inset of Fig. 3, no systematic correlation between the magnitude of
S(300 K) and dS/dT with respect to Fe concentration could be noticed.
This is in good agreement with the earlier theoretical prediction that
the DOS remains unaffected for small concentrations of dopants, and
rapid reduction of DOS occurs when T_(C) decreases below  25 K in
MgB₂.[19] It is worth mentioning that previous NMR investigation on Fe
substituted MgB₂ samples revealed a nearly unaffected DOS and the
observed variations in T_(C) has been attributed to the decrease in
phonon frequency and/or reduced electron-phonon coupling strength as a
result of disorder.[23] The present Seebeck coefficient measurements
also indicate no significant changes in DOS for Fe substitution levels
up to 3

In a polycrystalline sample, similar to Hall effect, the measured S is
the net value of the two bands, σ and π.[36, 37] Out of σ and π bands,
from the positive value of S it is clear that the holelike σ-band
dominates the thermoelectric transport in these Mg_(1 − x)Fe_(x)B₂
alloys. To maintain a nearly unchanged DOS we require a compensating
effect and/or charge transferring between σ and π bands upon Fe
substitution. The observed random variations in the room-temperature
Seebeck coefficient as well as the slope in the present study clearly
reveal that more than one mechanism may be competing with each other in
altering the DOS.

### Discussion

Among the dopants, Mn shows rapid reduction in T_(C) for a given
concentration and as expected, as a magnetic element, Mn can have
dramatic effect on T_(C) due to the pair breaking effect through
spin-flip scattering.[13, 14, 17] Although, Fe substitution shows weaker
decrease in T_(C) as compared with Mn, the decrease in T_(C) is more
pronounced than the other dopants like Al, Sc, C, etc., where the
depression of T_(C) has been attributed to the reduction of DOS through
the band filling effect.[7, 10, 12, 19, 20, 21, 22] The previous
theoretical study has predicted the nonmagnetic nature of Fe in MgB₂
lattice and subsequently NMR investigation has confirmed the entirely
nonmagnetic nature of Fe and as well as the absence of any traceable
magnetic impurities or impurity phases (both can act as a strong source
for spin-flip scattering), and nearly unchanged DOS.[17, 23] The
extrinsic disorder, disorder induced by neutron irradiation shows
significant variations in T_(C), nevertheless decrease in DOS has also
been observed.[38, 39] On the other hand, according to Puti and Chen _et
al.[27, 40]_ in undoped samples, the superconducting transition
temperature is insensitive to the intrinsic disorder to a considerable
extent, whereas it affects the normal state transport properties
significantly. It is interesting to note that only negligible variations
in T_(C) ( 1 K) have been reported for changes in residual resistivity
ratio (RRR) from 3 to 8, which is much larger when compared with the RRR
variations noticed among the present Fe concentrations ( 2-4). It is
common to note that the presence of MgO impurity phases, which can be
one of the major sources of disorder and may lead to increase in RRR,
nevertheless have only negligible effect on T_(C).

Upon substitution of other elements, except Mn, the T_(C) shows much
smaller variations for dopant concentrations equivalent to the present
Fe concentration ranges.[7, 11, 20, 21, 22, 34, 41] Particularly, the
T_(C) depression rate is more pronounced than the other well-known
substituent such as Al with the similar variations in the lattice
constant upon its substitution. As mentioned earlier, Al and Fe are
trivalent, nonmagnetic in MgB₂ lattice, and lattice constant decreases
upon their substitution. The induced disorder as a result of their
substitution at Mg lattice (substitutional disorder), may not have any
dramatic difference in the extent of disorder between them and hence the
substitutional disorder should show nearly identical effect on the
superconducting transition temperatures. Further, no traceable magnetic
impurities were noticed by NMR measurements,[23] and hence the effect of
small amounts of FeB impurity phase for higher Fe contents can be
treated similar to the inevitable MgO impurity phase, which is also
nonmagnetic and can be one of the sources of disorder. As mentioned
earlier, the superconducting transition temperature is insensitive to
disorder to a considerable extent. Therefore, in the present case, the
substitutional disorder (which we treat as intrinsic) as a result of Fe
substitution, if any, may affect only the normal state properties rather
than the superconducting properties.

These findings, nonmagnetic nature of Fe in MgB₂, modest T_(C)
depression rate when compared with Mn, much pronounced T_(C) depression
rate when compared with other elements like Al, and nearly unaffected
DOS place the Fe substitution in a very unique situation and bring up
the importance of the phonon contributions to the variation of T_(C) for
MgB₂. For a BCS phonon-mediated superconductor, it is well known that
the T_(C) is proportional to the phonon frequency ω, following the
McMillian formula. The unusual high critical temperature for MgB₂ is
partially attributed to the high frequency of the E_(2g) phonon mode (ω
=64−82 meV).[4, 19] The present Fe substitution is expected to
specifically modify the phonon spectrum, in order to alter the phonon
frequency and/or electron-phonon coupling strength. However, absence of
such an effect in the isoelectronic (like Al) and other dopants is an
open question. Most probably, such a scenario depends on the specific
nature of the given substituent element.

## IV Conclusions

substituted Mg_(1 − x)Fe_(x)B₂ samples with x =0
