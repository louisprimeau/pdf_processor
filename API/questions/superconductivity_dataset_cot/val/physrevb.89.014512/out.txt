23 October 2013201420 December 2013201 P-doped single crystals, the magnetic structure determination in EuFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} via neutron diffraction is considerably more challenging than that of other members of the new superconductors. The only attempt was made on a powder sample of the nonsuperconducting EuFe_{2}P_{2} where it was concluded that the Eu^{2+} moments order ferromagnetically with a canting angle of 17^{\circ} from the **c** axis [32]. Here, we report on the first element-specific x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS) studies of the superconducting EuFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} to explore the details of the magnetic structure of the Eu^{2+} moments. Our resonant scattering experiments show that the Eu^{2+} moments order ferromagnetically along the **c** axis at zero field and undergo a transition into a field-induced ferromagnetic state along the applied magnetic field direction for applied magnetic fields \geq0.6 T. Both the zero and applied magnetic field ferromagnetic order of the Eu^{2+} moments coexist with the bulk superconductivity.

## II Experimental details

Single crystals of EuFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} with x=0.05 and x=0.15 were grown using FeAs flux [33]. For the scattering measurements and for the superconducting composition x=0.15, an as-grown right isosceles triangular shaped single crystal with a base of approximately 2 mm and a thickness of 0.1 mm was selected. The _same_ crystal was used for all the macroscopic characterizations presented in this communication. For the nonsuperconducting x=0.05 sample, a crystal of approximate dimensions of 2 x 2 x 0.1 mm^{3} was chosen. The surface of both single crystals were perpendicular to the c axis. The XRMS experiments were performed at the Eu L_{3} edge at beamline P09 at the PETRA III synchrotron at DESY [34]. The incident radiation was linearly polarized parallel (\pi polarization) and perpendicular (\sigma polarization) to the horizontal and vertical scattering planes for the 15% and 5% doped samples, respectively. The spatial cross section of the beam was 0.2 (horizontal) x 0.05 (vertical) mm^{2}. Copper Cu (2 2 0) was used at the Eu L_{3} absorption edge as a polarization and energy analyzer to suppress the charge and fluorescence background relative to the magnetic scattering signal. The sample was mounted at the end of the cold finger of a cryomagnet with [2 1 0]_{T}[0 0 1]_{T} plane coincident with the scattering plane for the 15% doped sample. The magnetic field was applied along the [1 2 0] direction, which is perpendicular to the scattering plane. The 5% doped sample was measured inside a closed cycle Displex cryogenic refrigerator with [1 1 0]_{T}[0 0 1]_{T} as the scattering plane. Measurements at P09 were performed at temperatures between 5 and 180 K. For convenience, we will use tetragonal (T) notation unless otherwise specified.

## III Experimental results

### Macroscopic characterizations

Figures 1(a)-1(b) and 1(c)-1(d) show magnetic susceptibility (_M-T_) and isothermal magnetization (_M-H_) of the x=0.15 sample, respectively, measured for magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the c axis using a Quantum Design (SQUID) magnetometer. Zero-field cooled magnetization becomes negative for both field directions at T_{\rm SC}=25 K, signifying a superconducting transition at this temperature. Upon cooling towards the onset of Eu^{2+} ordering

Figure 1: (Color online) (a) and (b) Temperature dependencies of the magnetic susceptibility measured on heating of the zero-field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) sample at an applied magnetic field of 1 mT along the crystallographic [1 1 0]_{T} and [0 0 1]_{T} directions, respectively. (c) and (d) _M-H_ curves for magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the **c** axis at T=5 K (below magnetic and superconducting transitions) and 30 K (above superconducting and magnetic transitions). Horizontal dashed lines in both figures denote a fully saturated moment of Eu^{2+}. Lower insets for both figures show the hysteresis curves after subtraction of the ferromagnetic contribution as described in the text. The upper inset of Fig. 1(d) shows details of the _M-H_ dependence in the low-field region. (e) Temperature dependence of the specific heat. Upper and lower insets show details near the magnetic ordering of the Eu^{2+} and the superconducting transition, respectively. The solid curve represents the fit using Debye and Einstein contributions for the lattice part of the specific heat. The lattice part was subtracted from the total heat capacity to calculate the entropy release at T_{\rm C}.

  at T_{\rm C} = 19 K, the superconducting signal is first weakened, before it becomes more pronounced at temperatures below T_{\rm C}. Superconductivity wins over the Eu^{2+} magnetism if temperature is lowered further. The diamagnetic volume susceptibility for the magnetic field parallel to the [1 1 0] direction (in this direction demagnetization correction is small [35]) is greater than -0.5 indicating bulk superconductivity [51]. Effective diamagnetic susceptibility close to -1 for the ZFC curve provides an upper limit of superconducting volume fraction of 100%. Figures 1(c) and 1(d) show hysteresis loops at T = 5 and 30 K for the two field directions. The observed hysteresis curves look different than a type II nonmagnetic superconductor. However, a jump in magnetization, which is typical for a type-II superconductor, is clearly observed at 7 T magnetic field between the field increasing and decreasing cycles. To understand the atypical hysteresis curve, we assume a ferromagnetic contribution of the Eu^{2+} moments at an applied magnetic field H (in Tesla) by

\[\begin{split} m_{\rm Eu}&=(7.0/0.5)\times H\,\mu_{B },\quad\text{for}\quad|H|\leqslant 0.5\\ &=7.0\,\times H/\,|H|\,\mu_{B},\quad\text{for}\quad|H|\geqslant 0.5, \end{split}\] (1)

since very little hysteresis was observed for the ferromagnetic end member EuFe_{2}P_{2}[36]. Lower insets to Figs. 1(c) and 1(d) show magnetization after subtraction of the ferromagnetic contribution from the Eu^{2+} moments according to Eq. (1). The hysteresis curves after subtraction look very similar to the other Fe based superconductors [12,37]. The jump at 7-T magnetic field is consistent with Bean's critical state model together with Lenz's law [38-40]. Reversal of the direction of change of applied field as at 7 T does not remove the specimen from the critical state but merely reverses locally the direction of the critical current according to Lenz's law. Therefore magnetization measurements strongly hint towards a ferromagnetic superconductor in an applied magnetic field. The heat capacity of the same single crystal was measured using a Quantum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS) and is shown in Fig. 1(e). Specific heat data show a clear phase transition at T_{\rm C} = 19 K indicating the onset of the Eu^{2+} magnetic order. A specific heat jump at T_{\rm SC} is clearly visible and amounts to \Delta C\approx 350 mJ/mol K, which is slightly less but of the same order of magnitude as that observed for the K-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} system [41]. Due to the difficulties in determination of \Delta C as well as "\gamma" as a result of large magnetic contribution at low temperatures, it will be hugely erroneous to estimate the value of \Delta C/(\gamma\,T_{\rm SC}) and make comparison with other nonmagnetic iron-based superconductors. Heat capacity measurement down to mK temperature range is needed to correctly estimate the value of \gamma. The entropy release associated with the magnetic order of the Eu^{2+} moments amounts to 17.1 J/mol K, which is equal to 99% of the expected theoretical value R\ln(2S+1) for Eu^{2+} moments with spin S=7/2. Therefore the specific heat measurement indicates that substantial volume of the sample, if not 100%, contributes to both the superconductivity and magnetic order of the Eu^{2+} moments. Moreover, the full moment of Eu^{2+} is completely ordered at the single phase transition temperature T_{\rm C} of 19 K.

### X-ray resonant magnetic scattering

To determine whether there is a structural phase transition, as observed in the parent compound EuFe_{2}As_{2}, (\xi\xi0)_{T} scans were performed through the tetragonal (2 8)r Bragg reflection as a function of temperature. The inset to Fig. 2(a) shows a subset of (\xi\xi0)_{T} scans through the (2 2 8)r reflection for the 15% doped sample as the sample was cooled through T_{\rm S}=49\pm 1 K. The splitting of the (2 2 8)r Bragg reflection into orthorhombic (O) (4 0 8)_{O} and (0 4 8)_{O} Bragg reflections below T_{\rm S} is consistent with the structural transition, from space group I4/mmm to Fmmm, with a distortion along the [1 1 0] direction. As the sample is cooled further, the orthorhombic splitting (\delta) increases down to T=30\pm 1 K as can be seen from Fig. 2(a). Near T_{\rm SC}, \delta shows a local minimum due to the competition between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. Lowering the temperature below T_{\rm C} results in a smooth decrease in \delta, reminiscent of that observed in the superconducting Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} samples [42]. The nonsuperconducting 5% doped sample undergoes a similar structural phase transition at T_{\rm S}=165\pm 1 K but without any decrease of the orthorhombic distortion for lower temperatures.

Below T_{\rm C}=20 K, a magnetic signal was observed when the x-ray energy was tuned through the Eu L_{3} edge at reciprocal lattice points identical to those of the charge reflections, indicating the onset of the Eu^{2+} magnetic order at the magnetic propagation vector \bm{\tau}= (0 0 0). Figure 2(b) depicts the temperature evolution of the (2 1 7) reflection measured at the Eu L_{3} edge at resonance (E=6.973 keV). A variation of the magnetic intensity with temperature was only observed in the \pi\rightarrow\sigma^{\prime} scattering channel, whereas the \pi\rightarrow\pi^{\prime} scattering channel shows no discernible temperature dependence. The transition temperature is similar to that observed in the parent EuFe_{2}As_{2} compound and consistent with the results presented in Fig. 1. Figure 2(c) shows temperature dependence of the same (2 1 7) reflection in an applied magnetic field of 0.5 T along the [1 \overline{2}0] direction in both scattering channels. It is interesting to see that the temperature dependence appears in the opposite scattering channel compared to the zero field and indicates a possible flop of the magnetic moment in an applied magnetic field which will be discussed later. The transition temperature is increased from 19 K at zero field to 29 K at 0.5 T.

To confirm the resonant magnetic behavior of the peaks, we performed energy scans at the Eu L_{3} absorption edge as shown in Fig. 3. We note that for the (2 1 7) reflection charge and magnetic peak coincide. An investigation of the magnetic signal which is five to six orders of magnitude weaker than the Thomson charge scattering requires significant reduction of the charge background. The charge background can be reduced significantly for a reflection with scattering angle close to 90^{\circ}[43,44]. Since the (2 1 7) reflection has a scattering angle of \sim94.5^{\circ} at the Eu L_{3} edge, the investigation of the magnetic signal seems feasible for this reflection. Figure 3(b) shows an energy scan through the (2 1 7) reflection after subtracting the nonmagnetic background at T = 22 K. A clear resonance enhancement can be seen close to the Eu L_{3} edge. A similar resonance enhancement can be observed in the \pi\rightarrow\pi^{\prime} scattering channel in an applied magnetic field of 3 T. In both energy scans, the resonance peaks appear at and above the Eu L_{3} absorption edge, indicating the dipole  nature of the transition. Figure 3(d) shows energy scans through the antiferromagnetic (0 0 3) position, expected for an A-type AFM structure, for the 15% doped sample in the \pi\rightarrow\sigma^{\prime} scattering channel. For comparison, we also show the energy scan through the (0 0 9) position in Fig. 3(e) for the 5% doped sample measured under similar conditions. A strong antiferromagnetic signal was observed for the 5% doped sample at the A-type AFM position, which is in contrast to the 15% doped sample where no magnetic signal was observed. Therefore the proposed A-type AFM structure [28] could not be confirmed for the superconducting 15% P-doped sample. This might be due to the small moment in the A-type AFM structure together with the glassy freezing of the in-plane component as suggested by Ref. [29].

### Magnetic structure in zero and applied magnetic fields

We now turn to the determination of the magnetic moment configuration for the Eu^{2+} moments in the zero and applied magnetic fields. For the crystallographic space group _Fmmm_

The lines represent fits to the data using either one (red) or two (blue) Lorentzian squared peaks. (b) Temperature dependence of the (2 1 7) reflection in both the \pi\rightarrow\sigma^{\prime} and \pi\rightarrow\pi^{\prime} scattering geometries at zero filed. The schematic shows the used scattering geometry. (c) Same as (b) but in an applied magnetic field of 0.5 T. The temperature dependencies were measured at the peak energy (\sim6.973 keV) of the resonance enhancement observed in the energy scans.

  and \bm{\tau} = (0 0 0), three independent magnetic representations (MRs) are possible [45]. Here, we note that only ferromagnetic structures with magnetic moments along the three crystallographic directions **a**, **b**, **c** are allowed by symmetry. No antiferromagnetic structure with \bm{\tau} = (0 0 0) is possible in this case for symmetry reasons. All the MRs along with the calculated intensities for different polarization geometries are listed in Table 1.

The resonant scattering of interest, at the Eu L_{3} absorption edge, is due to electric dipole transitions between the core 2p states and the 5d conduction bands. The 5d bands are spin polarized through the exchange interaction with the magnetic 4f electrons. The resonant magnetic scattering cross-section for the dipole resonance can be written as [46]

\[f_{\pi E1}^{\text{XRMS}} = [(\hat{\epsilon}^{^{\prime}}\cdot\hat{\epsilon})F^{(0)}-i(\hat{ \epsilon}^{^{\prime}}\times\hat{\epsilon})\cdot\hat{\epsilon}_{n}F^{(1)}\] (2) \[+(\hat{\epsilon}^{^{\prime}}\cdot\hat{\epsilon}_{n})(\hat{ \epsilon}\cdot\hat{\epsilon}_{n})F^{(2)}],\]

where \hat{\epsilon}_{n} is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetic moment of the  containing dipole matrix elements. The first term of Eq. (2) contributes to the charge Bragg peak as it does not contain any dependence on the magnetic moment. The other two terms are sensitive to the magnetic moment. For a ferromagnetic structure, in general, all terms contribute to the scattering at every Bragg reflection. However, for the Eu^{2+} ions with spin only magnetic moment, the spherical symmetry of the spin-polarized 5d band ensures that the F^{(2)} term is zero [47]. For the \pi\,\rightarrow\,\sigma^{\prime} scattering geometry, the scattering amplitude from Eq. (2) can be written in a simplified form as f\,\propto\,\mathbf{k}_{i}\cdot\bm{\mu}[48], where \mathbf{k}_{\mathbf{i}} and \bm{\mu} are the wave vector of the incoming photons and the magnetic moment, respectively. Clearly, the magnetic signal is sensitive to the component of the ordered moment in the scattering plane, i.e., a/b and c components. For the \pi\rightarrow\pi^{\prime} scattering geometry, the scattering amplitude can be written as f\,\propto\,(\mathbf{k}_{i}\,\times\,\mathbf{k}_{f})\cdot\bm{\mu}[48], where \mathbf{k}_{\mathbf{f}} is the wave vector of the outgoing photons. Therefore, in the \pi\rightarrow\pi^{\prime} scattering geometry, the magnetic signal is sensitive to the component of the ordered moment perpendicular to the scattering plane, i.e., only a/b components. Since, no magnetic signal was observed in the \pi\rightarrow\pi^{\prime} scattering channel at zero field [see Fig. 2(b)], we conclude that the magnetic moments are aligned primarily along the \mathbf{c} axis. For the applied magnetic field the situation is reversed. The magnetic signal is observed only in the \pi\rightarrow\pi^{\prime} scattering channel [see Fig. 2(c)] indicating the magnetic moments are in the a-b plane. It is most likely that the magnetic moments are along the applied filed direction, i.e., along the [1   * [8] K. Sasmal, B. Lv, B. Lorenz, A. M. Guloy, F. Chen, Y.-Y. Xue, and C.-W. Chu, Phys. Rev.

23 October 2013201420 December 2013201 P-doped single crystals, the magnetic structure determination in EuFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} via neutron diffraction is considerably more challenging than that of other members of the new superconductors. The only attempt was made on a powder sample of the nonsuperconducting EuFe_{2}P_{2} where it was concluded that the Eu^{2+} moments order ferromagnetically with a canting angle of 17^{\circ} from the **c** axis [32]. Here, we report on the first element-specific x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS) studies of the superconducting EuFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} to explore the details of the magnetic structure of the Eu^{2+} moments. Our resonant scattering experiments show that the Eu^{2+} moments order ferromagnetically along the **c** axis at zero field and undergo a transition into a field-induced ferromagnetic state along the applied magnetic field direction for applied magnetic fields \geq0.6 T. Both the zero and applied magnetic field ferromagnetic order of the Eu^{2+} moments coexist with the bulk superconductivity.

## II Experimental details

Single crystals of EuFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} with x=0.05 and x=0.15 were grown using FeAs flux [33]. For the scattering measurements and for the superconducting composition x=0.15, an as-grown right isosceles triangular shaped single crystal with a base of approximately 2 mm and a thickness of 0.1 mm was selected. The _same_ crystal was used for all the macroscopic characterizations presented in this communication. For the nonsuperconducting x=0.05 sample, a crystal of approximate dimensions of 2 x 2 x 0.1 mm^{3} was chosen. The surface of both single crystals were perpendicular to the c axis. The XRMS experiments were performed at the Eu L_{3} edge at beamline P09 at the PETRA III synchrotron at DESY [34]. The incident radiation was linearly polarized parallel (\pi polarization) and perpendicular (\sigma polarization) to the horizontal and vertical scattering planes for the 15% and 5% doped samples, respectively. The spatial cross section of the beam was 0.2 (horizontal) x 0.05 (vertical) mm^{2}. Copper Cu (2 2 0) was used at the Eu L_{3} absorption edge as a polarization and energy analyzer to suppress the charge and fluorescence background relative to the magnetic scattering signal. The sample was mounted at the end of the cold finger of a cryomagnet with [2 1 0]_{T}[0 0 1]_{T} plane coincident with the scattering plane for the 15% doped sample. The magnetic field was applied along the [1 2 0] direction, which is perpendicular to the scattering plane. The 5% doped sample was measured inside a closed cycle Displex cryogenic refrigerator with [1 1 0]_{T}[0 0 1]_{T} as the scattering plane. Measurements at P09 were performed at temperatures between 5 and 180 K. For convenience, we will use tetragonal (T) notation unless otherwise specified.

## III Experimental results

### Macroscopic characterizations

Figures 1(a)-1(b) and 1(c)-1(d) show magnetic susceptibility (_M-T_) and isothermal magnetization (_M-H_) of the x=0.15 sample, respectively, measured for magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the c axis using a Quantum Design (SQUID) magnetometer. Zero-field cooled magnetization becomes negative for both field directions at T_{\rm SC}=25 K, signifying a superconducting transition at this temperature. Upon cooling towards the onset of Eu^{2+} ordering

Figure 1: (Color online) (a) and (b) Temperature dependencies of the magnetic susceptibility measured on heating of the zero-field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) sample at an applied magnetic field of 1 mT along the crystallographic [1 1 0]_{T} and [0 0 1]_{T} directions, respectively. (c) and (d) _M-H_ curves for magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the **c** axis at T=5 K (below magnetic and superconducting transitions) and 30 K (above superconducting and magnetic transitions). Horizontal dashed lines in both figures denote a fully saturated moment of Eu^{2+}. Lower insets for both figures show the hysteresis curves after subtraction of the ferromagnetic contribution as described in the text. The upper inset of Fig. 1(d) shows details of the _M-H_ dependence in the low-field region. (e) Temperature dependence of the specific heat. Upper and lower insets show details near the magnetic ordering of the Eu^{2+} and the superconducting transition, respectively. The solid curve represents the fit using Debye and Einstein contributions for the lattice part of the specific heat. The lattice part was subtracted from the total heat capacity to calculate the entropy release at T_{\rm C}.

  at T_{\rm C} = 19 K, the superconducting signal is first weakened, before it becomes more pronounced at temperatures below T_{\rm C}. Superconductivity wins over the Eu^{2+} magnetism if temperature is lowered further. The diamagnetic volume susceptibility for the magnetic field parallel to the [1 1 0] direction (in this direction demagnetization correction is small [35]) is greater than -0.5 indicating bulk superconductivity [51]. Effective diamagnetic susceptibility close to -1 for the ZFC curve provides an upper limit of superconducting volume fraction of 100%. Figures 1(c) and 1(d) show hysteresis loops at T = 5 and 30 K for the two field directions. The observed hysteresis curves look different than a type II nonmagnetic superconductor. However, a jump in magnetization, which is typical for a type-II superconductor, is clearly observed at 7 T magnetic field between the field increasing and decreasing cycles. To understand the atypical hysteresis curve, we assume a ferromagnetic contribution of the Eu^{2+} moments at an applied magnetic field H (in Tesla) by

\[\begin{split} m_{\rm Eu}&=(7.0/0.5)\times H\,\mu_{B },\quad\text{for}\quad|H|\leqslant 0.5\\ &=7.0\,\times H/\,|H|\,\mu_{B},\quad\text{for}\quad|H|\geqslant 0.5, \end{split}\] (1)

since very little hysteresis was observed for the ferromagnetic end member EuFe_{2}P_{2}[36]. Lower insets to Figs. 1(c) and 1(d) show magnetization after subtraction of the ferromagnetic contribution from the Eu^{2+} moments according to Eq. (1). The hysteresis curves after subtraction look very similar to the other Fe based superconductors [12,37]. The jump at 7-T magnetic field is consistent with Bean's critical state model together with Lenz's law [38-40]. Reversal of the direction of change of applied field as at 7 T does not remove the specimen from the critical state but merely reverses locally the direction of the critical current according to Lenz's law. Therefore magnetization measurements strongly hint towards a ferromagnetic superconductor in an applied magnetic field. The heat capacity of the same single crystal was measured using a Quantum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS) and is shown in Fig. 1(e). Specific heat data show a clear phase transition at T_{\rm C} = 19 K indicating the onset of the Eu^{2+} magnetic order. A specific heat jump at T_{\rm SC} is clearly visible and amounts to \Delta C\approx 350 mJ/mol K, which is slightly less but of the same order of magnitude as that observed for the K-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} system [41]. Due to the difficulties in determination of \Delta C as well as "\gamma" as a result of large magnetic contribution at low temperatures, it will be hugely erroneous to estimate the value of \Delta C/(\gamma\,T_{\rm SC}) and make comparison with other nonmagnetic iron-based superconductors. Heat capacity measurement down to mK temperature range is needed to correctly estimate the value of \gamma. The entropy release associated with the magnetic order of the Eu^{2+} moments amounts to 17.1 J/mol K, which is equal to 99% of the expected theoretical value R\ln(2S+1) for Eu^{2+} moments with spin S=7/2. Therefore the specific heat measurement indicates that substantial volume of the sample, if not 100%, contributes to both the superconductivity and magnetic order of the Eu^{2+} moments. Moreover, the full moment of Eu^{2+} is completely ordered at the single phase transition temperature T_{\rm C} of 19 K.

### X-ray resonant magnetic scattering

To determine whether there is a structural phase transition, as observed in the parent compound EuFe_{2}As_{2}, (\xi\xi0)_{T} scans were performed through the tetragonal (2 8)r Bragg reflection as a function of temperature. The inset to Fig. 2(a) shows a subset of (\xi\xi0)_{T} scans through the (2 2 8)r reflection for the 15% doped sample as the sample was cooled through T_{\rm S}=49\pm 1 K. The splitting of the (2 2 8)r Bragg reflection into orthorhombic (O) (4 0 8)_{O} and (0 4 8)_{O} Bragg reflections below T_{\rm S} is consistent with the structural transition, from space group I4/mmm to Fmmm, with a distortion along the [1 1 0] direction. As the sample is cooled further, the orthorhombic splitting (\delta) increases down to T=30\pm 1 K as can be seen from Fig. 2(a). Near T_{\rm SC}, \delta shows a local minimum due to the competition between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. Lowering the temperature below T_{\rm C} results in a smooth decrease in \delta, reminiscent of that observed in the superconducting Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} samples [42]. The nonsuperconducting 5% doped sample undergoes a similar structural phase transition at T_{\rm S}=165\pm 1 K but without any decrease of the orthorhombic distortion for lower temperatures.

Below T_{\rm C}=20 K, a magnetic signal was observed when the x-ray energy was tuned through the Eu L_{3} edge at reciprocal lattice points identical to those of the charge reflections, indicating the onset of the Eu^{2+} magnetic order at the magnetic propagation vector \bm{\tau}= (0 0 0). Figure 2(b) depicts the temperature evolution of the (2 1 7) reflection measured at the Eu L_{3} edge at resonance (E=6.973 keV). A variation of the magnetic intensity with temperature was only observed in the \pi\rightarrow\sigma^{\prime} scattering channel, whereas the \pi\rightarrow\pi^{\prime} scattering channel shows no discernible temperature dependence. The transition temperature is similar to that observed in the parent EuFe_{2}As_{2} compound and consistent with the results presented in Fig. 1. Figure 2(c) shows temperature dependence of the same (2 1 7) reflection in an applied magnetic field of 0.5 T along the [1 \overline{2}0] direction in both scattering channels. It is interesting to see that the temperature dependence appears in the opposite scattering channel compared to the zero field and indicates a possible flop of the magnetic moment in an applied magnetic field which will be discussed later. The transition temperature is increased from 19 K at zero field to 29 K at 0.5 T.

To confirm the resonant magnetic behavior of the peaks, we performed energy scans at the Eu L_{3} absorption edge as shown in Fig. 3. We note that for the (2 1 7) reflection charge and magnetic peak coincide. An investigation of the magnetic signal which is five to six orders of magnitude weaker than the Thomson charge scattering requires significant reduction of the charge background. The charge background can be reduced significantly for a reflection with scattering angle close to 90^{\circ}[43,44]. Since the (2 1 7) reflection has a scattering angle of \sim94.5^{\circ} at the Eu L_{3} edge, the investigation of the magnetic signal seems feasible for this reflection. Figure 3(b) shows an energy scan through the (2 1 7) reflection after subtracting the nonmagnetic background at T = 22 K. A clear resonance enhancement can be seen close to the Eu L_{3} edge. A similar resonance enhancement can be observed in the \pi\rightarrow\pi^{\prime} scattering channel in an applied magnetic field of 3 T. In both energy scans, the resonance peaks appear at and above the Eu L_{3} absorption edge, indicating the dipole  nature of the transition. Figure 3(d) shows energy scans through the antiferromagnetic (0 0 3) position, expected for an A-type AFM structure, for the 15% doped sample in the \pi\rightarrow\sigma^{\prime} scattering channel. For comparison, we also show the energy scan through the (0 0 9) position in Fig. 3(e) for the 5% doped sample measured under similar conditions. A strong antiferromagnetic signal was observed for the 5% doped sample at the A-type AFM position, which is in contrast to the 15% doped sample where no magnetic signal was observed. Therefore the proposed A-type AFM structure [28] could not be confirmed for the superconducting 15% P-doped sample. This might be due to the small moment in the A-type AFM structure together with the glassy freezing of the in-plane component as suggested by Ref. [29].

### Magnetic structure in zero and applied magnetic fields

We now turn to the determination of the magnetic moment configuration for the Eu^{2+} moments in the zero and applied magnetic fields. For the crystallographic space group _Fmmm_

The lines represent fits to the data using either one (red) or two (blue) Lorentzian squared peaks. (b) Temperature dependence of the (2 1 7) reflection in both the \pi\rightarrow\sigma^{\prime} and \pi\rightarrow\pi^{\prime} scattering geometries at zero filed. The schematic shows the used scattering geometry. (c) Same as (b) but in an applied magnetic field of 0.5 T. The temperature dependencies were measured at the peak energy (\sim6.973 keV) of the resonance enhancement observed in the energy scans.

  and \bm{\tau} = (0 0 0), three independent magnetic representations (MRs) are possible [45]. Here, we note that only ferromagnetic structures with magnetic moments along the three crystallographic directions **a**, **b**, **c** are allowed by symmetry. No antiferromagnetic structure with \bm{\tau} = (0 0 0) is possible in this case for symmetry reasons. All the MRs along with the calculated intensities for different polarization geometries are listed in Table 1.

The resonant scattering of interest, at the Eu L_{3} absorption edge, is due to electric dipole transitions between the core 2p states and the 5d conduction bands. The 5d bands are spin polarized through the exchange interaction with the magnetic 4f electrons. The resonant magnetic scattering cross-section for the dipole resonance can be written as [46]

\[f_{\pi E1}^{\text{XRMS}} = [(\hat{\epsilon}^{^{\prime}}\cdot\hat{\epsilon})F^{(0)}-i(\hat{ \epsilon}^{^{\prime}}\times\hat{\epsilon})\cdot\hat{\epsilon}_{n}F^{(1)}\] (2) \[+(\hat{\epsilon}^{^{\prime}}\cdot\hat{\epsilon}_{n})(\hat{ \epsilon}\cdot\hat{\epsilon}_{n})F^{(2)}],\]

where \hat{\epsilon}_{n} is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetic moment of the  containing dipole matrix elements. The first term of Eq. (2) contributes to the charge Bragg peak as it does not contain any dependence on the magnetic moment. The other two terms are sensitive to the magnetic moment. For a ferromagnetic structure, in general, all terms contribute to the scattering at every Bragg reflection. However, for the Eu^{2+} ions with spin only magnetic moment, the spherical symmetry of the spin-polarized 5d band ensures that the F^{(2)} term is zero [47]. For the \pi\,\rightarrow\,\sigma^{\prime} scattering geometry, the scattering amplitude from Eq. (2) can be written in a simplified form as f\,\propto\,\mathbf{k}_{i}\cdot\bm{\mu}[48], where \mathbf{k}_{\mathbf{i}} and \bm{\mu} are the wave vector of the incoming photons and the magnetic moment, respectively. Clearly, the magnetic signal is sensitive to the component of the ordered moment in the scattering plane, i.e., a/b and c components. For the \pi\rightarrow\pi^{\prime} scattering geometry, the scattering amplitude can be written as f\,\propto\,(\mathbf{k}_{i}\,\times\,\mathbf{k}_{f})\cdot\bm{\mu}[48], where \mathbf{k}_{\mathbf{f}} is the wave vector of the outgoing photons. Therefore, in the \pi\rightarrow\pi^{\prime} scattering geometry, the magnetic signal is sensitive to the component of the ordered moment perpendicular to the scattering plane, i.e., only a/b components. Since, no magnetic signal was observed in the \pi\rightarrow\pi^{\prime} scattering channel at zero field [see Fig. 2(b)], we conclude that the magnetic moments are aligned primarily along the \mathbf{c} axis. For the applied magnetic field the situation is reversed. The magnetic signal is observed only in the \pi\rightarrow\pi^{\prime} scattering channel [see Fig. 2(c)] indicating the magnetic moments are in the a-b plane. It is most likely that the magnetic moments are along the applied filed direction, i.e., along the [1   * [8] K. Sasmal, B. Lv, B. Lorenz, A. M. Guloy, F. Chen, Y.-Y. Xue, and C.-W. Chu, Phys. Rev.
