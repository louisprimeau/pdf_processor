23 October 2013201420 December 2013201 P-doped single crystals, the
magnetic structure determination in EuFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂ via neutron
diffraction is considerably more challenging than that of other members
of the new superconductors. The only attempt was made on a powder sample
of the nonsuperconducting EuFe₂P₂ where it was concluded that the Eu²⁺
moments order ferromagnetically with a canting angle of 17^(∘) from the
**c** axis [32]. Here, we report on the first element-specific x-ray
resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS) studies of the superconducting
EuFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂ to explore the details of the magnetic structure
of the Eu²⁺ moments. Our resonant scattering experiments show that the
Eu²⁺ moments order ferromagnetically along the **c** axis at zero field
and undergo a transition into a field-induced ferromagnetic state along
the applied magnetic field direction for applied magnetic fields ≥0.6 T.
Both the zero and applied magnetic field ferromagnetic order of the Eu²⁺
moments coexist with the bulk superconductivity.

## II Experimental details

Single crystals of EuFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂ with x = 0.05 and x = 0.15
were grown using FeAs flux [33]. For the scattering measurements and for
the superconducting composition x = 0.15, an as-grown right isosceles
triangular shaped single crystal with a base of approximately 2 mm and a
thickness of 0.1 mm was selected. The _same_ crystal was used for all
the macroscopic characterizations presented in this communication. For
the nonsuperconducting x = 0.05 sample, a crystal of approximate
dimensions of 2 x 2 x 0.1 mm³ was chosen. The surface of both single
crystals were perpendicular to the c axis. The XRMS experiments were
performed at the Eu L₃ edge at beamline P09 at the PETRA III synchrotron
at DESY [34]. The incident radiation was linearly polarized parallel (π
polarization) and perpendicular (σ polarization) to the horizontal and
vertical scattering planes for the 15

## III Experimental results

### Macroscopic characterizations

Figures 1(a)-1(b) and 1(c)-1(d) show magnetic susceptibility (_M-T_) and
isothermal magnetization (_M-H_) of the x = 0.15 sample, respectively,
measured for magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the c axis
using a Quantum Design (SQUID) magnetometer. Zero-field cooled
magnetization becomes negative for both field directions at
$T_{\rm SC}=25$ K, signifying a superconducting transition at this
temperature. Upon cooling towards the onset of Eu²⁺ ordering

Figure 1: (Color online) (a) and (b) Temperature dependencies of the
magnetic susceptibility measured on heating of the zero-field cooled
(ZFC) and field cooled (FC) sample at an applied magnetic field of 1 mT
along the crystallographic [1 1 0]_(T) and [0 0 1]_(T) directions,
respectively. (c) and (d) _M-H_ curves for magnetic fields parallel and
perpendicular to the **c** axis at T = 5 K (below magnetic and
superconducting transitions) and 30 K (above superconducting and
magnetic transitions). Horizontal dashed lines in both figures denote a
fully saturated moment of Eu²⁺. Lower insets for both figures show the
hysteresis curves after subtraction of the ferromagnetic contribution as
described in the text. The upper inset of Fig. 1(d) shows details of the
_M-H_ dependence in the low-field region. (e) Temperature dependence of
the specific heat. Upper and lower insets show details near the magnetic
ordering of the Eu²⁺ and the superconducting transition, respectively.
The solid curve represents the fit using Debye and Einstein
contributions for the lattice part of the specific heat. The lattice
part was subtracted from the total heat capacity to calculate the
entropy release at $T_{\rm C}$.

at $T_{\rm C}$ = 19 K, the superconducting signal is first weakened,
before it becomes more pronounced at temperatures below $T_{\rm C}$.
Superconductivity wins over the Eu²⁺ magnetism if temperature is lowered
further. The diamagnetic volume susceptibility for the magnetic field
parallel to the [1 1 0] direction (in this direction demagnetization
correction is small [35]) is greater than −0.5 indicating bulk
superconductivity [51]. Effective diamagnetic susceptibility close to −1
for the ZFC curve provides an upper limit of superconducting volume
fraction of 100

$$\begin{split} m_{\rm Eu}&=(7.0/0.5)\times H\,\mu_{B },\quad\text{for}\quad|H|\leqslant 0.5\\ &=7.0\,\times H/\,|H|\,\mu_{B},\quad\text{for}\quad|H|\geqslant 0.5, \end{split}$$
(1)

since very little hysteresis was observed for the ferromagnetic end
member EuFe₂P₂[36]. Lower insets to Figs. 1(c) and 1(d) show
magnetization after subtraction of the ferromagnetic contribution from
the Eu²⁺ moments according to Eq. (1). The hysteresis curves after
subtraction look very similar to the other Fe based superconductors
[12,37]. The jump at 7-T magnetic field is consistent with Bean’s
critical state model together with Lenz’s law [38-40]. Reversal of the
direction of change of applied field as at 7 T does not remove the
specimen from the critical state but merely reverses locally the
direction of the critical current according to Lenz’s law. Therefore
magnetization measurements strongly hint towards a ferromagnetic
superconductor in an applied magnetic field. The heat capacity of the
same single crystal was measured using a Quantum Design physical
property measurement system (PPMS) and is shown in Fig. 1(e). Specific
heat data show a clear phase transition at $T_{\rm C}$ = 19 K indicating
the onset of the Eu²⁺ magnetic order. A specific heat jump at
$T_{\rm SC}$ is clearly visible and amounts to ΔC≈ 350 mJ/mol K, which
is slightly less but of the same order of magnitude as that observed for
the K-doped BaFe₂As₂ system [41]. Due to the difficulties in
determination of ΔC as well as "γ" as a result of large magnetic
contribution at low temperatures, it will be hugely erroneous to
estimate the value of $\Delta C/(\gamma\,T_{\rm SC})$ and make
comparison with other nonmagnetic iron-based superconductors. Heat
capacity measurement down to mK temperature range is needed to correctly
estimate the value of γ. The entropy release associated with the
magnetic order of the Eu²⁺ moments amounts to 17.1 J/mol K, which is
equal to 99

### X-ray resonant magnetic scattering

To determine whether there is a structural phase transition, as observed
in the parent compound EuFe₂As₂, (ξξ0)_(T) scans were performed through
the tetragonal (2 8)r Bragg reflection as a function of temperature. The
inset to Fig. 2(a) shows a subset of (ξξ0)_(T) scans through the (2 2
8)r reflection for the 15

Below $T_{\rm C}=20$ K, a magnetic signal was observed when the x-ray
energy was tuned through the Eu L₃ edge at reciprocal lattice points
identical to those of the charge reflections, indicating the onset of
the Eu²⁺ magnetic order at the magnetic propagation vector τ= (0 0 0).
Figure 2(b) depicts the temperature evolution of the (2 1 7) reflection
measured at the Eu L₃ edge at resonance (E = 6.973 keV). A variation of
the magnetic intensity with temperature was only observed in the
π → σ^(′) scattering channel, whereas the π → π^(′) scattering channel
shows no discernible temperature dependence. The transition temperature
is similar to that observed in the parent EuFe₂As₂ compound and
consistent with the results presented in Fig. 1. Figure 2(c) shows
temperature dependence of the same (2 1 7) reflection in an applied
magnetic field of 0.5 T along the [1 $\overline{2}$0] direction in both
scattering channels. It is interesting to see that the temperature
dependence appears in the opposite scattering channel compared to the
zero field and indicates a possible flop of the magnetic moment in an
applied magnetic field which will be discussed later. The transition
temperature is increased from 19 K at zero field to 29 K at 0.5 T.

To confirm the resonant magnetic behavior of the peaks, we performed
energy scans at the Eu L₃ absorption edge as shown in Fig. 3. We note
that for the (2 1 7) reflection charge and magnetic peak coincide. An
investigation of the magnetic signal which is five to six orders of
magnitude weaker than the Thomson charge scattering requires significant
reduction of the charge background. The charge background can be reduced
significantly for a reflection with scattering angle close to
90^(∘)[43,44]. Since the (2 1 7) reflection has a scattering angle of
∼94.5^(∘) at the Eu L₃ edge, the investigation of the magnetic signal
seems feasible for this reflection. Figure 3(b) shows an energy scan
through the (2 1 7) reflection after subtracting the nonmagnetic
background at T = 22 K. A clear resonance enhancement can be seen close
to the Eu L₃ edge. A similar resonance enhancement can be observed in
the π → π^(′) scattering channel in an applied magnetic field of 3 T. In
both energy scans, the resonance peaks appear at and above the Eu L₃
absorption edge, indicating the dipole nature of the transition. Figure
3(d) shows energy scans through the antiferromagnetic (0 0 3) position,
expected for an A-type AFM structure, for the 15

### Magnetic structure in zero and applied magnetic fields

We now turn to the determination of the magnetic moment configuration
for the Eu²⁺ moments in the zero and applied magnetic fields. For the
crystallographic space group _Fmmm_

inflection point of the fluorescence yield. (b) and (c) Energy scans for
the (2 1 7) reflection after subtraction of the nonmagnetic background

positions for the 15

transition. The lines represent fits to the data using either one (red)
or two (blue) Lorentzian squared peaks. (b) Temperature dependence of
the (2 1 7) reflection in both the π → σ^(′) and π → π^(′) scattering
geometries at zero filed. The schematic shows the used scattering
geometry. (c) Same as (b) but in an applied magnetic field of 0.5 T. The
temperature dependencies were measured at the peak energy (∼6.973 keV)
of the resonance enhancement observed in the energy scans.

and τ = (0 0 0), three independent magnetic representations (MRs) are
possible [45]. Here, we note that only ferromagnetic structures with
magnetic moments along the three crystallographic directions **a**,
**b**, **c** are allowed by symmetry. No antiferromagnetic structure
with τ = (0 0 0) is possible in this case for symmetry reasons. All the
MRs along with the calculated intensities for different polarization
geometries are listed in Table 1.

The resonant scattering of interest, at the Eu L₃ absorption edge, is
due to electric dipole transitions between the core 2p states and the 5d
conduction bands. The 5d bands are spin polarized through the exchange
interaction with the magnetic 4f electrons. The resonant magnetic
scattering cross-section for the dipole resonance can be written as [46]

f_(πE1)^(XRMS) = [(ϵ̂^(^(′)) ⋅ ϵ̂)F⁽⁰⁾ − i(ϵ̂^(^(′)) × ϵ̂) ⋅ ϵ̂_(n)F⁽¹⁾
(2)
+(ϵ̂^(^(′)) ⋅ ϵ̂_(n))(ϵ̂ ⋅ ϵ̂_(n))F⁽²⁾],

where ϵ̂_(n) is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetic moment of
the containing dipole matrix elements. The first term of Eq. (2)
contributes to the charge Bragg peak as it does not contain any
dependence on the magnetic moment. The other two terms are sensitive to
the magnetic moment. For a ferromagnetic structure, in general, all
terms contribute to the scattering at every Bragg reflection. However,
for the Eu²⁺ ions with spin only magnetic moment, the spherical symmetry
of the spin-polarized 5d band ensures that the F⁽²⁾ term is zero [47].
For the π → σ^(′) scattering geometry, the scattering amplitude from Eq.
(2) can be written in a simplified form as f ∝ k_(i) ⋅ μ[48], where
k_(i) and μ are the wave vector of the incoming photons and the magnetic
moment, respectively. Clearly, the magnetic signal is sensitive to the
component of the ordered moment in the scattering plane, i.e., a/b and c
components. For the π → π^(′) scattering geometry, the scattering
amplitude can be written as f ∝ (k_(i) × k_(f)) ⋅ μ[48], where k_(f) is
the wave vector of the outgoing photons. Therefore, in the π → π^(′)
scattering geometry, the magnetic signal is sensitive to the component
of the ordered moment perpendicular to the scattering plane, i.e., only
a/b components. Since, no magnetic signal was observed in the π → π^(′)
scattering channel at zero field [see Fig. 2(b)], we conclude that the
magnetic moments are aligned primarily along the c axis. For the applied
magnetic field the situation is reversed. The magnetic signal is
observed only in the π → π^(′) scattering channel [see Fig. 2(c)]
indicating the magnetic moments are in the a-b plane. It is most likely
that the magnetic moments are along the applied filed direction, i.e.,
along the [1
