###### Abstract

Tunneling spectroscopy using a break-junction technique has been conducted to determine the superconducting gap structure of the ternary silicide-layered superconductor CaAlSi with and without superstructure. We find that the tunneling conductance in CaAlSi shows a single gap feature, which can be described by the BCS density of states. The gap size \(\Delta\) obtained from the tunneling conductance in CaAlSi without superstructure is estimated to be approximately 1.0 meV, corresponding to a weak-coupling gap ratio. On the other hand, for a specimen with superstructure, the largest gap, \(\Delta\)=1.5 meV, significantly deviates from the BCS value, indicating strong-coupling superconductivity. These results demonstrate systematic variations in the pairing interaction with superstructure formations, which are consistent with heat capacity measurements.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in MgB\({}_{2}\) with the layered AlB\({}_{2}\)-type structure [1] has refocused interest onto related compounds as a possible basis for developing new superconductors. In particular, an interesting class of material is the ternary silicide superconductor, such as \(M_{1}M_{2}\)Si (\(M_{1}\): Ca, Sr, Ba and \(M_{2}\): Al, Ga) which also has the AlB\({}_{2}\)-type crystal structure with the honeycomb layer formed by \(M_{2}\) and Si atoms. [2, 3, 4] Since \(M_{1}M_{2}\)Si has a practical advantage over MgB\({}_{2}\) that large single crystals are available, it has been stimulating active investigation as a reference material of MgB\({}_{2}\).

According to a recent report, [5] CaAlSi (CAS) exhibits two types of multistacked crystal structure that indicates a clear fivefold (5\(H\)-CAS, \(T_{c}\)\(\sim\) 5.7 K) or sixfold (6\(H\)-CAS, \(T_{c}\)\(\sim\) 7.8 K) superlattice along the \(c\) axis caused by buckling and rotation in the AlSi layer. It is notable that the differences between the two types of multistacked structures are attributed to the 60\({}^{\circ}\) rotation of the Al/Si arrangement in the AlSi layers around the \(c\) axis, and the buckling and flat AlSi layers in different sequences in the two structures (see Fig. 1). On the other hand, we have reported on clean CAS, which has only a flat AlSi layer with Al and Si atoms being distributed regularly in the hexagonal (\(B_{2}\)) plane without a superstructure (1\(H\)-CAS, \(T_{c}\)\(\sim\) 6.5 K). [6] Interestingly, we have found that \(T_{c}\) and many other transport properties in CaAlSi depend on the superstructure periodicity. [6] For instance, the field-induced magnetic response in 1\(H\)-CAS exhibits almost isotropic characteristics for each crystal axis, while that in superstructured specimens (5\(H\)- and 6\(H\)-CAS) shows anisotropic ones. Moreover, in our previous heat capacity measurements, the sizes of the superconducting gap in 5\(H\)- and 6\(H\)-CAS were far larger than that expected for the BCS weak-coupling limit (i.e., 2\(\Delta\)/\(k_{B}T_{c}\): 6\(H\)-CAS\(\sim\) 5.2 and 5\(H\)-CAS\(\sim\) 4.4). On the other hand, the 2\(\Delta\)/\(k_{B}T_{c}\) value of 1\(H\)-CAS is estimated to be \(\sim\)3.5, which suggests that it belongs to the BCS weak-coupling limit.

We have focused our interest on investigating the relationship between the superconducting properties and the electronic states composed of the flat and/or buckling AlSi layers. In this paper, we report the systematic microscopic study of the structure and size of the superconducting gap in a direct manner by tunneling spectroscopy for 6\(H\)-, 5\(H\)-, and 1\(H\)-CAS.

## II Experimental details

The single crystals of the respective phases (6\(H\)-, 5\(H\)-, and 1\(H\)-CAS) used in the present experiments are identical to those used in our previous studies; thereby, we refer readers to our previous report for the details of the growth conditions and superconducting parameters. [6]

The tunneling spectroscopy measurements were conducted using an _in situ_ break-junction technique. [7] The plate-like specimen with a size of 3.0\(\times\) 2.0\(\times\) 0.5 mm\({}^{3}\) was cracked

  at 4.2 K perpendicular to the length direction just before the measurement, thereby forming a superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) junction with a clean and unaffected interface. This technique enables highly sensitive probing of the structure and size of the superconducting gap (e.g., multigap feature [8]). It is recognized from the SIS junction that the bias voltage between the conductance peaks (\(V_{\rm{p-p}}\)) for tunneling conductance \(dI/dV\) corresponds to 4D/\(e\), where 2D is the superconducting gap. The gap size thus obtained at each temperature is just the same as that obtained from conductance fitting using the BCS density of states. [9] Furthermore, with such an SIS junction with an unaffected interface, the gap characteristics can be directly determined, even in the vicinity of \(T_{c}\), owing to the enhancement of the gap-edge peaks as a result of the piling up of densities of states in both sides of the electrodes. [9] The current (\(I\))-voltage (\(V\)) characteristics were measured by the ac modulation technique with a four-probe method.

## III Experimental results and discussion

Figure 2 shows the \(dI/dV\) spectra obtained from different break junctions at 4.2 K for 6_H_-, 5_H_-, and 1_H_-CAS. We stress that these \(dI/dV\) tunneling spectra are highly reproducible and were obtained from several break junctions. As shown in Fig. 2, the sharp gap-edge peaks due to the SIS junction for all specimens were clearly observed. For 6_H_-CAS, the step structure inside the main peaks can be explained by the simultaneous transfer of two particles (\(n\)-particle tunneling effect) and/or the superconductor-insulator-normal metal tunneling component. The dashed curves in Fig. 2 are calculation results for the tunneling density of states (DOS) \(N(E,\Gamma)\) for the SIS junction, assuming the lifetime-broadened BCS DOS proposed by Dynes _et al._,[10]

\[I(V)=C\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}N(E,\Gamma)N(E+eV,\Gamma)[f(E)-f(E+eV)dE],\] (1)

\[N(E,\Gamma)=|{\rm Re}(E-i\Gamma)/\sqrt{(E-i\Gamma)^{2}-\Delta^{2}}|,\] (2)

where \(C\) is the scaling parameter, \(\Gamma\) is the phenomenological broadening parameter, \(f(E)\) is the Fermi distribution function describing the thermal effect, and \(\Delta\) is the energy gap. For the fitting, we first calculated the tunneling current \(I(V)\) using Eqs. (1) and (2) at a fixed temperature with the appropriate parameters \(\Delta\) and \(\Gamma\), and then \(I(V)\) was numerically differentiated. The agreement between the experimental \(dI/dV\) spectra and the calculated ones justifies the assumption that the DOS in CAS is described by the BCS DOS.

Figure 3 shows the temperature variations of SIS tunneling conductance for the junctions in Figs. 2(b), 2(d), and 2(f) for 6_H_-, 5_H_-, and 1_H_-CAS, respectively. The small peak structures at zero bias are due to the Josephson effect and/or thermally excited quasiparticle tunneling effect.[11, 12] The gap-edge structures are gradually broadened and suppressed with increasing temperature. We find that the gap structures for all samples completely vanish at \(T_{c}\).

The temperature dependences of the energy gap \(\Delta\) and the normalized zero-bias conductance (NZBC =[\(dI/dV(0)\)]/[\(dI/dV(10\) mV)] for 6_H_-, 5_H_-, and 1_H_-CAS are shown in Fig. 4. The different symbols correspond to the different break junctions. The solid curves in the main panels represent the temperature dependence of the standard BCS energy gap having a weak-coupling limit (2\(\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}\)=3.52) for the bulk \(T_{c}\), while the dashed curves are the scaled BCS curves. Note that multiple fitting curves are needed to reconstruct the temperature dependences of \(\Delta\) in 5_H_- and 6_H_-CAS. These fitted curves do not cross each other, indicating a systematic behavior of the distributed gaps. The maximum and minimum values of \(\Delta(0)\) are listed in Fig. 4, where we can distinguish the range of the ratio 2\(\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}\) among 6_H_-, 5_H_-, and 1_H_-CAS (Table 1).

For 5_H_- and 6_H_-CAS, the gap values in the low-temperature limit were extrapolated by fitting the scaled BCS curves, allowing some uncertainties in determining \(\Delta(0)\). This procedure is inevitable in deducing the gap data at 0 K. In this case, \(T_{c}\)'s of the fitted BCS curves are obtained from the temperature dependence of the zero-bias conductance of each junction, as shown in insets of Fig. 4, from which \(T_{c}\) is precisely determined. We can thus determine a proper range of \(\Delta(0)\) that is relatively unscattered and that systematically changes with \(T_{c}\). On the other hand, we stress that \(\Delta(T)\) in

Different symbols in each frame denote different junctions. The solid curves in main panels represent a standard BCS prediction with the respective bulk \(T_{c}\), while the dashed curves are the scaled BCS curves.

 1_H_-CAS can be well fitted by only one component of a scaled BCS curve, indicating a uniform or weakly distributed gap structure.

Here, we discuss the observed difference in the distributions of D(_T_) for 6_H_-, 5_H_-, and 1_H_-CAS. One of the possible origins of the gap distributions in 5_H_- and 6_H_-CAS is the two-dimensional electronic states, as confirmed by the ratio of inter-/in-plane electrical resistivity, the coherence length,[6] and the magnetic penetration depth.[13] On the other hand, for 1_H_-CAS, a theoretical investigation suggested that the in-plane plasma frequency has almost the same value as the interplane one,[14, 15] because of the isotropic effective carrier mass. In fact, the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau parameter GGL, which is related to the ratio of in-/interplane effective carrier mass, for 1_H_-CAS was experimentally estimated to be approximately 1.2, which is considerably smaller than those of 5_H_- and 6_H_-CAS with the superstructure (GGL =3.2-4.0).[6] Moreover, our recent _ab initio_ calculations on the electronic band structures of 5_H_- and 6_H_-CAS indicate that the Fermi surface properties of 5_H_- and 6_H_-CAS are drastically different from those of 1_H_-CAS.[16] In particular, cylindrical Fermi surface sheets appear along the _M_-_L_ line in the hexagonal Brillouin zone of 5_H_- and 6_H_-CAS. These results suggest that 5_H_- and 6_H_-CAS possess highly two-dimensional electronic states, which is markedly different from 1_H_-CAS. From this viewpoint, the scattered temperature dependences of the gap in 5_H_- and 6_H_-CAS could be due to the anisotropy of electronic ground states.

We also should mention the possibility that the distribution of D(_T_) in 5_H_- and 6_H_-CAS is attributable to the spatial modulation in the superconducting order parameter to the proximity effect, and not to the multiple-band superconductivity. This is because each D(_T_) has different _T_c in contrast to the multigap feature exhibiting single _T_c. For MgB2 (Ref. 8) and the layered nitride superconductor,[17] it was reported that the mesoscopic gap distributions and proximity-induced effect could exist owing to inhomogeneous carrier density associated with the layered structures. Hence, such a gap distribution in 5_H_- and 6_H_-CAS cannot be simply connected with the multiple gaped scenario as in MgB2. Especially, the tunnel conductance for CaAlSi is not described by the correlated two gap model for a two band superconductor, but expressed by a simple BCS model. Moreover, the previous angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements[18] have suggested that CaAlSi is in sharp contrast to MgB2 in which multiple gaps are observed.[19] It is notable that CaAlSi exhibits an identical gap magnitude on different Fermi surface sheets around \(M\) and G points in the hexagonal Brillouin zone. Therefore, it is unreasonable that the present tunneling data are evidence of the presence of a multigap structure in this system. It should also be noted that both temperature and magnetic-field dependences of the specific heat show the existence of a BCS gap, thereby showing no evidence for the multiple-gap feature. Consequently, the difference in the distributions of D(_T_) in 6_H_-, 5_H_-, and 1_H_-CAS probably depends on the dimensionality (two or three dimensional) in the electronic structure involving the proximity effect arising from the layered structure. We note that _T_c and the gap value indeed scatter, but their ratio is sufficiently converged to conclude that they are in reasonable agreement with each other.

We next discuss the larger gap ratios observed in 5_H_- and 6_H_-CAS than in 1_H_-CAS. One of the possible origins of the large gap extending to the very strong-coupling regime is associated with the difference in the anisotropic conduction band structures between 6_H_-, 5_H_-, and 1_H_-CAS. The results of ARPES[18] and theoretical investigation[14, 15, 16] indicate that the \(p\) bands in CAS are mainly composed of 3\(p\)2 electrons of Al/Si atoms, which possess fully three-dimensional characteristics, while the \(s\) band is derived from the hybridization of 3s, 3\(p\)2, and 3\(p\)2. From the theoretical prediction, the contribution of the \(p\) band at the Fermi energy is suppressed with decreasing crystal symmetry, suggesting that the three-dimensionality in the electronic ground states in 5_H_- and 6_H_-CAS is weaker than that in 1_H_-CAS. This leads to the possibility that the conduction band structures are largely modified, including the spectral change in the electron-phonon interaction, thereby resulting in different pairing strengths. The low dimensionality should restrict the electron-phonon interactions, thereby, the interactions with the particular wave vectors could be enhanced to cause the strong-coupling superconductivity, even though _T_c is not greatly enhanced possibly because of unavoidable randomness of the real crystal structure.

Finally, it should be noted that the gap sizes for CAS are consistent with those obtained from the previous bulk heat capacity measurements,[6] as listed in Table 1. Moreover, such a different gap ratio between superstructured specimens and 1_H_-CAS is further supported by our recent superconducting gap measurements on 6_H_-, 5_H_-, and 1_H_-CaAlSi using high-resolution ARPES.[20] Therefore, we claim that the large gap values observed here in 5_H_- and 6_H_-CAS are due not to surface or local effects but to intrinsic bulk properties. It should be emphasized that a slight _T_c increase from 6 to 7.7 K accompanies the drastic enhancement of the ratio

## IV Conclusion

We performed tunneling spectroscopy experiments using a break-junction technique on the ternary silicide superconductor CaAlSi with and without a superstructure to elucidate the correlation between the superstructure and the superconducting gap from a microscopic point of view. From the superconducting gap measurements, we found that 6\(H\)- and 5\(H\)-CAS belong to a strong-coupling regime, while 1\(H\)-CAS is a weak-coupling BCS superconductor. These results indicate that the pairing interaction is considerably enhanced by the superstructure formation, which should modify the dimensionality in the electronic ground states and thus the spectral feature of that particular electron-phonon interaction.
