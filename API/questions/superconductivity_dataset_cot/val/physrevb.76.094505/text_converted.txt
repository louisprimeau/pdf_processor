###### Abstract

A study of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth λ_(ab) in a series of
the cuprate superconductors Ca_(2 − x)Na_(x)CuO₂Cl₂ (Na-CCOC) with Na
content x = 0.11, 0.12, 0.15, 0.18, and 0.19 is reported. The
zero-temperature values of λ_(ab)(0) were obtained by means of the
muon-spin rotation technique, as well as from measurements of the
intrinsic susceptibility χ^(int)(0) by using the procedure developed by
Kanigel _et al._ [Phys. Rev. B **71**, 224511 (2005)]. λ_(ab) at T = 0 K
was found to increase with decreasing doping from λ_(ab)(0) = 316(19 nm)
for the x = 0.19 sample to λ_(ab)(0) = 430(26) nm for the x = 0.11 one.
From a comparison of the present Na-CCOC data with those of
Br₂Sr_(2 − x)La_(x)CuO_(6 + δ) and La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ cuprate
superconductors, it is concluded that substitution of the apical oxygen
by chlorine decreases the coupling between the superconducting CuO₂
planes, leading to an enhancement of the two-dimensional properties of
Na-CCOC.

## I Introduction

The question if the out-of-plane electronic states are essential for
high-temperature superconductivity is a matter of debate for a long
time. In fact, the idea that in perovskites with their octahedral oxygen
environment, the Jahn-Teller effect may lead to an enhanced
electron-phonon coupling has guided Bednorz and Muller in their original
search for oxide superconductors.[1] Bearing this in mind, one may ask
if, in addition to the planar states, the apical states too play a role
in the occurrence of high-temperature superconductivity. There is still
no clear answer to this question. On the one hand, observation of
superconductivity in materials with apical oxygen replaced by halogen
atoms (such as F, Cl, Br)[2, 3, 4] as well as the absence of an apical
oxygen isotope effect on the transition temperature T_(c) (Ref. [5]) and
the zero-temperature in-plane magnetic field penetration depth λ_(ab)(0)
(Ref. [6]) suggest that the apical sites do not play a major role. On
the other hand, the doubling of T_(c) (Ref. [7]) and the change of the
Fermi surface topology from "holelike" to "electronlike"[8] in
epitaxially trained La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ films as well as a clear
correlation between the transition temperature at optimal doping and the
degree of localization of the axial orbitals in the CuO₂ planes[9] give
evidence that apical states are indeed involved in superconductivity.
One should also mention that there are compounds where superconductivity
has proven to be induced by apical oxygen doping.[10, 11]

In order to elucidate the role of the apical sites, it is important to
clarify the origin of similarities and differences between cuprates with
oxygen and halogen atoms (such as F, Cl, Br) on the apical sites.
Crucial information can be obtained from measurements of the magnetic
field penetration depth λ. λ is one of the fundamental lengths of a
superconductor which, within a simple London model, relates two
important superconducting parameters, the charge carrier concentration
n_(s) and the mass of the charge carriers m^(*), according to
λ⁻²∝n_(s)/m^(*). The temperature dependence of λ reflects the
quasiparticle density of states available for thermal excitations and,
therefore, probes the superconducting gap structure. The shape of λ(T)
and the zero-temperature value λ(0) provides relevant information on the
superconducting mechanism and sets a scale for the screening of an
external magnetic field. Here, we report studies of the in-plane
magnetic penetration depth λ_(ab) for a series of
Ca_(2 − x)Na_(x)CuO₂Cl₂ (Na-CCOC) samples with x = 0.11, 0.12, 0.15,
0.18, and 0.19. Ca_(2 − x)Na_(x)CuO₂Cl₂ is a structural analog to the
La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ with Cl atoms replacing oxygen on the apical sites.
The zero-temperature values of λ_(ab) were obtained by means of
muon-spin rotation (μSR) as well as from measurements of the intrinsic
susceptibility χ^(int)(0) by using the procedure developed by Kanigel
_et al.[12]_ It was found that the measured λ_(ab)(0) data points for
Na-CCOC are all shifted to the left side of the universal Uemura line,
which represents a linear correlation between the zero-temperature
superfluid density ρ_(t)∝λ_(ab)⁻²(0) and the transition temperature
T_(c) for various hole-doped high-temperature cuprate superconductors
(HTS’s).[13, 14] Based on a comparison of the Na-CCOC data with the data
of Bi₂Sr_(2 − x)La_(x)CuO_(6 + δ) (Bi2201) and La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄
(La214), it is concluded that replacing of apical oxygen by Cl decreases
the coupling between the superconducting CuO₂ planes, leading to an
enhancement of the two-dimensional properties of Na-CCOC. The reason for
this is very likely due to a substantial reduction of the amount of
holes on the apical sites in comparison to La214. In addition,
field-induced magnetism was detected in optimally doped
Ca_(1.82)Na_(0.18)CuO₂Cl₂, suggesting that Na-CCOC has a competing
magnetic state very close in free energy to their superconducting state.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we describe the sample
preparation procedure and details of the muon-spin rotation and
magnetization experiments. The dependence of the muon-spin
depolarization rate σ on temperature and magnetic field is presented in
Sec. III A. Sections III B and III C comprise studies of the in-plane
magnetic penetration depth λ_(ab) by means of μSR and magnetization
techniques. The comparison of the superfluid density ρ_(s)∝λ_(ab)⁻²(0)
for Na-CCOC with that for other hole-doped HTS’s with oxygen on the
apical site is presented in Sec. IV A. The two-dimensional aspects of
the superfluid density are discussed in Sec. IV B. The conclusions
follow in Sec. V.

## II Experimental details

Underdoped and optimally doped superconducting Ca²⁻Na_(x)CuO₂Cl₂ samples
with Na content x = 0.11, 0.12, 0.15, 0.18, and 0.19 were synthesized
under high pressure by using the procedure described in Ref. [15]. It
includes, first, the synthesis of the nonsuperconducting parent compound
Ca₂CuO₂Cl₂ and, second, the high-pressure annealing of Ca₂CuO₂Cl₂ mixed
with NaClO₄ and NaCl. Ca₂CuO₂Cl₂ was synthesized by a solid-state
reaction of Ca₂CuO₃, CuO, and CaCl₂. The powder mixture was pressed into
a pellet and synthesized at 750 ^(∘) C in argon flow with several
intermediate grindings under ambient pressure. The resulting Ca₂CuO₂Cl₂
was well mixed with NaClO₄ and NaCl in a molar ratio of 1:0.2:0.2 in a
dry box and sealed in Pt cylindrical capsules of 6−8 mm internal
diameter and 7−9 mm length. High-pressure experiments were performed in
opposed anvil-type high-pressure devices at 40−45 kbar. After applying
pressure, the temperature was increased for 1.5 h up to the maximum of
1350−1700 ^(∘)C and kept stable for 0.5 h. Then, the temperature was
slowly decreased to 1000 ^(∘)C and, finally, to room temperature. The
high pressure was maintained constant throughout the synthesis and was
removed only after the cell was cooled to room temperature. The Na
content was estimated from the comparison of the c-axis lattice
constants obtained in x-ray experiments with those reported in Refs. [3]
and [16]. Due to extreme high hygroscopicity of Ca_(2 − x)Na_(x)CuO₂Cl₂,
all the manipulations with the samples were made in the glovebox filled
with Ar.

Zero-field and transverse-field μSR experiments were performed at the
πM3 and πE1 beam lines at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Villigen,
Switzerland). The μSR experiments were performed on two samples: an
optimally doped sample with Na content x = 0.18 (T_(c) ≃ 27 K) and a
slightly underdoped one with x = 0.12 (T_(c) = 18 K). In a
superconducting sample, the magnetic penetration depth λ can be
extracted from the second moment ⟨ΔB²⟩ of the probability distribution
of the local magnetic field P(B) in the mixed state probed by μSR [17].
In the present study, we first analyzed the μSR time spectra by using a
direct Fourier transform based on a maximum entropy algorithm [18], with
no prior assumptions on the form of P(B). It was found that a Gaussian
distribution of local fields gives a reasonable estimate of P(B) (see
Fig. 1), in agreement with previous observations [19]. Therefore, the
μSR time spectra were analyzed by using a Gaussian relaxation function
R(t) = exp[−σ²t²/2]. The second moment of P(B) was then obtained as
⟨ΔB²⟩ = σ²/γ_(μ)² (γ_(μ) = 2 π×135.5342 MHz/T is the muon gyromagnetic
ratio).

The field-cooled 0.5 mT magnetization measurements for the Na-CCOC
samples (x ≃ 0.11, 0.12, 0.15, 0.18, and 0.19) were performed by using a
superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer. In order to
follow the procedure described in Ref. [12], the samples used for the
magnetization experiments were preliminary powderized and then placed in
quartz ampoules (1.5 mm inner diameter). The masses of the samples were
∼25−30 mg. The ratio of the diameter to the height of the powder in the
ampoule was approximately 1−7. The magnetic field was applied parallel
to the ampoule axis. As shown in Ref. [12], for this geometry the
zero-temperature "intrinsic" susceptibility, obtained from the
field-cooled magnetization, is proportional to the inverse squared
in-plane magnetic penetration depth, χ^(m)(0)∝λ_(ab)⁻²(0).

## III Experimental results

### Dependence of the muon-spin depolarization rate σ on T and H

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependences of the muon-spin
depolarization rate σ obtained from the fits to the μSR data. It is seen
that for both Na-CCOC samples studied by μSR, σ(T) is constant above
T_(c) and starts to rise with decreasing temperature for T < T_(c). Most
interestingly, however, is that in the low-temperature region an
inflection point (T_(ip)) appears below which σ starts to increase
rather sharply. It is also seen that with increasing magnetic field, σ
below T_(ip) rises faster and T_(ip) has a tendency to shift to higher
temperatures. Indeed, the inset in Fig. 2(a) shows that when the
magnetic field increases from 0.2 to 0.64 T, T_(ip) for the x = 0.18
sample shifts from approximately 4 to 6 K and the ratio σ(1.7
K)/σ(T_(ip)) changes from 1.05 to 1.20. The behavior of σ(T) below
T_(ip) clearly demonstrates that some kind of magnetic ordering takes
place in Na-CCOC. The zero-field μSR experiments of Ohishi _et al._[20]
performed on a series of Na-CCOC (x = 0.0−0.12) samples, reveal the
presence of spin-glass-type magnetism in the x = 0.12 sample with a
spin-glass ordering temperature of ≃2.5 K. This suggests that the
increase of σ at T<T^(ip), seen in Fig. 2(b), is simply a consequence of
it. The situation for the x = 0.18 sample is, however, not so clear. Our
zero-field μSR experiments gave no indication for any magnetism in this
particular sample down to T ≃ 1.7 K. On the other hand, the increase of
σ(T) below

Ca_(1.82)Na_(0.15)CuO₂Cl₂ sample at μ₀H=0.2 T in the normal (T =37K) and

entropy Fourier transform technique. The solid lines represent fits with
a single Gaussian line.

T_(ip) and the shift of T_(ip) to higher temperatures, both correlated
with the magnetic field [see inset of Fig. 2(a)], clearly demonstrate
the appearance and enhancement of magnetism in the x = 0.18 sample. Note
that field-induced magnetism was recently observed by Savici _et
al._[21] in highly underdoped La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄,
La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄, and La_(2 − x)Eu_(x)CuO₄ HTS’s. It was shown that
the increase of the relaxation above the antiferromagnetic ordering
temperature T_(N) and the superconducting transition temperature T_(c)
is due to quasistatic random fields induced by the external magnetic
field.[21]

In order to study field-induced magnetism in the x≃ 0.18 sample in more
detail, σ was measured as a function of H above (37 K) and below (1.7 K)
the superconducting transition temperature (Fig. 3). Note that all σ(1.7
K) data points were obtained after field cooling the sample from far
above T_(c) to 1.7 K in the corresponding field. Above T_(c), the
magnetic contribution σ_(m) was obtained by subtracting the nuclear
contribution (σ_(nm)=0.132 μs⁻¹ at μ₀H=0.01 T) from the measured σ as
σ_(m)²=σ²-σ_(nm)². In order to obtain σ_(m) at T =1.7 K, we used the
following procedure. Bearing in mind that below T_(c) a superconducting
component σ_(sc) is present, the total σ obtained in μSR experiments is
a sum of[22]

σ²(T) = σ_(m)²(T) + σ_(sc)²(T) + σ_(nm)²(T) .
(1)

In the next step, we assumed that σ_(nm) does not depend on temperature
and that in the temperature range T_(ip) < T < T_(c) the measured σ(T)
is determined predominantly by the superconducting part of the muon-spin
depolarization rate σ_(sc)(T) and the nuclear dipolar component σ_(nm).
The temperature dependence of σ_(sc)(T) was assumed to be described by
the power law[17]

σ_(sc)(T) = σ_(sc)(0)[1 − (T/T_(c))^(α)].
(2)

The corresponding fitting curves are shown in Fig. 2(a). Finally, σ_(m)
at T=1.7 K was calculated as σ_(m)(1.7 K) =[σ²(1.7 K) −σ_(sc)²(1.7 K)
−σ_(nm)²]^(0.5). The field dependence of σ_(m) for T=1.7 and 37 K is
shown in the inset of Fig. 3. It is seen that for both temperatures,
σ_(m) increases linearly with increasing magnetic field, in good
agreement with the results of Savici _et al.[21]_ We want to point,
however, to the difference between the optimally doped
Ca_(1.82)Na_(0.18)CuO₂Cl₂ sample measured here and the undoped
La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄, La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄, and La_(2 − x)Eu_(x)CuO₄
HTS’s studied in Ref. 21. Untill now, field-induced magnetism was
observed only for systems exhibiting static magnetism in zero field.[21]
This is not the case for the x = 0.18 sample, since no magnetism was
detected in zero-field μSR experiments down to ≃1.7 K. Even though we
cannot rule out completely the appearance of zero-field magnetism at
lower temperatures, the enhancement of magnetism with increasing field
would imply that optimally doped Na-CCOC has a competing magnetic state
very close in free energy to their superconducting state.

contribution σ_(m). The blue and the red lines are guides for the eye.

inset in (a) shows the extension of the low-temperature region.

### Determination of λ_(ab)(0) by means of muon-spin rotation

In earlier transverse-field μSR experiments on YBa₂Cu₃O_(7 − δ), it was
observed that the relaxation rate σ for nonoriented powders exhibits
nearly no magnetic field dependence in a rather broad field range
(typically, from ∼0.05 to ∼0.4 T).[17] This can be explained within the
London model which predicts that the second moment of the magnetic field
distribution in a perfect vortex lattice is independent of the applied
magnetic field for 2H_(c1)≤5H≪H_(c2) (H_(c1) and H_(c2) are the first
and the second critical fields, respectively).[23] This feature allows a
direct comparison of values of σ_(sc) obtained for various HTS’s at
various doping levels and taken at different magnetic fields. In order
to check if the relation σ_(sc)(H)≈ const also holds for Na-CCOC, we
subtract the magnetic contribution σ_(m) for μ₀H=0.2 and 0.64 T from the
measured σ in accordance with Eq. (1) and plot the resulting
(σ_(sc)²+σ_(nm)²)^(0.5) values (blue stars) in Fig. 3. Two tendencies
are clearly seen: First, for fields smaller than 0.2 T, one can almost
neglect the magnetic contribution σ_(m) to the measured σ. This is
confirmed by the field dependence of σ_(m) presented in the inset of
Fig. 3, revealing that for μ₀H<0.2 T the σ_(m) at T=1.7 K is more than
five times smaller than the measured σ. Second, the solid blue line
shows that for the x≃0.18 sample, the relation σ_(sc)(H)≃ const holds
for μ₀H≃ 0.15 T. The slow decrease of σ_(sc) above 0.15 T can be
explained by nonlocal and nonlinear corrections to σ_(sc) due to the
d-wave order parameter of HTS.[24, 25, 26]

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of σ_(sc), obtained after
subtraction of σ_(nm) from the data presented in Fig. 2. Since at low
temperatures a magnetic contribution is present, data points below 4 K
were excluded in the analysis. The solid lines represent fits to the
power law [Eq. (2)]. From the obtained values of σ_(sc)(0), the
zero-temperature values of the in-plane magnetic field penetration depth
λ_(ab)(0) were determined as[17]

$$\lambda_{ab}(\mbox{nm})=\frac{224}{\sqrt{\sigma_{sc}(\mu{\rm s}^{-1})}}.$$
(3)

The results of the fits and the values of λ_(ab)(0) obtained by Eq. (3)
are summarized in Table 1. Note that λ_(ab)(0) =317(19) nm for x≃ 0.18
sample is more than 40

### Determination of λ_(ab)(0) in low-field magnetization experiments

In order to complete the in-plane magnetic field penetration depth study
of the HTS Na-CCOC, we performed similar field-cooled magnetization
(M_(FC)) experiments as reported by Kanigel _et al.[12]_ It was shown
that for HTS powder samples, shaped in a cylindrical container having a
diameter much smaller than its length, λ_(ab)(0) can be obtained from
the so-called intrinsic susceptibility χ^(int)(0)= M_(FC)(0)/M_(id)
(M_(id) is the magnetization of an ideal diamagnet) according to the
relation χ^(int)(0)∝λ_(ab)⁻²(0).[12] Figure 5 shows M_(FC)(T) curves for
Ca_(2 − x)Na_(x)CuO₂Cl₂ (x≃ 0.11, 0.12, 0.15, 0.18, and 0.19) samples
taken at 0.5 mT. The transition temperatures T_(c) and the values of
χ^(int)(0) were obtained from the intersection of the linearly
extrapolated M_(FC) curves with the M=0 line and by extrapolating the
low-temperature part of M_(FC)(T) to T =0, respectively (see Fig. 5 and
Table 1). From the measured values of χ^(int)(0), the zero-temperature
values of λ_(ab)(0) were then obtained by normalizing to
λ_(ab)(0)=317(19) nm derived for the Ca_(1.82)Na_(0.18)CuO₂Cl₂ sample by
μSR (see Table 1). A quick glance at Table 1 reveals that the procedure
described

Figure 4: (Color online) Temperature dependences of σ_(sc)×λ_(ab)⁻² for
Ca_(2 − x)Na_(x)CuO₂Cl₂ (x = 0.18, upper curve; x = 0.12, lower curve).
The solid lines represent power law fits to the data. See text for
details.

in Ref. [12] is indeed reliable, since the values of λ_(ab)(0) for the
x ≈ 0.12 sample obtained by means of both techniques used in the present
study agree rather well.

## IV Discussions

Comparison with superfluid densities of high-temperature superconductors
with oxygen on the apical site

To compare the results for Na-CCOC with the results for other hole-doped
superconductors, in Fig. 6 we plot T_(c) as a function of the
zero-temperature superfluid density ρ_(x) ∝ λ⁻²(0) ∝ σ_(xc)(0). We also
include data points for Na-CCOC (x = 0.18), [27] for the structurally
related compound with oxygen on the apical site La214, [14, 28] for the
single-layer HTS Bi2201, [29] and for underdoped YBa₂Cu₃O_(7 − δ) (Y123)
with highly reduced T_(c). [30] The dashed line represents the famous
"Uemura" relation [linear correlation between T_(c) and
λ⁻²(0)∝ n_(J)/m^(*) for various families of underdoped HTS’s [15, 14]].
It is seen that points for Na-CCOC at all levels of doping as well as
points for Bi2201 and highly underdoped Y123 lie significantly higher
than expected for the "Uemura" relation. The solid line corresponds to
the power law σ_(xc)(0) ∝ T_(c)^(1.6) obtained in Ref. [30]. While the
agreement between Na-CCOC, Bi2201, and highly underdoped Y123 is rather
good, the points for the structurally related compound La214 are shifted
to the right. Only 4 out of 18 points coincide with those for Na-CCOC:
three points for underdoped La214 with highly reduced T_(c)’s and one
for overdoped La214 (T_(c) ≈ 32 K). As was recently pointed out by Russo
_et al._, [29] the agreement with underdoped Y123 and with points for
underdoped La214 should be taken with caution. It was shown by
zero-field μSR experiments on La214 (Ref. [31]) and Y123 (Ref. [32])
having rather reduced T_(c)’s that a major volume fraction exhibits
static magnetic order and, probably, does not carry the superfluid. [33]
Thus, the reduction of the superfluid density for both of these
compounds may be a simple consequence of it. [29] In contrast, the
results for Bi2201 were obtained for samples which do not involve static
magnetic order [29] and, correspondingly, might represent an intrinsic
property free of possible complications due to magnetic fractions.
Therefore, we are first going to compare the present Na-CCOC data with
those of Bi2201 and, later on, with La214.

The good agreement between the Na-CCOC and Bi2201 data presented in Fig.
6 suggests that there are some similarities between these two compounds:
(i) Both Na-CCOC and Bi2201 are highly anisotropic superconductors.
Highly two-dimensional (2D) properties of the Na-CCOC system were
recently reported by Kim _et al._[27] They found that the fluctuation
induced magnetization and the irreversibility line obtained for Na-CCOC
(x = 0.18) show pronounced 2D behavior. The anisotropy coefficient γ was
estimated to be in the range 50 < γ  < 800. Even though the range of γ
reported in Ref. [27] is rather broad, the value of γ is much higher
than, e.g., γ  = 15 obtained for optimally doped La214, [34] but is
consistent with γ  = 400 for optimally doped Bi2201. [35] (ii) The inset
in Fig. 6 reveals that both Na-CCOC and Bi2201 have similar values for
the hopping integral ratio t^(′)/t (t and t^(′) are the first and the
second nearest neighbor transfer integrals between the Cu sites in CuO₂
planes). Pavarini _et al._[9]

various hole-doped HTS’s with oxygen on the apical site. Solid red
circles and blue stars are Na-CCOC data obtained in the present study
(see Table 1). The green circle is the data point for Na-CCOC (x = 0.18)
from Ref. [27]. Open squares are La214 data from Refs. [14] and [28].
Open triangles are Bi2201 data taken from Ref. [29] and open circles are
Y123 data from Ref. [30]. The dashed line represents the “Uemura”
relation (Refs. [13] and [14]). The solid red line corresponds to the
power law with σ_(xc)(0) ∝ T_(c)^(1.6) from Ref. [30]. The inset shows
the hopping integral ratio t^(′)/t as a function of plane Cu -apical
position distance for La214, Bi2201, Tl2201, and Hg2201 HTS’s obtained
from local-density approximation (LDA) band structure calculations
(after Ref. [9]). The circles are t^(′)/t values for Na-CCOC (x = 0.10,
0.12) (Ref. [36]), La214 (Ref. [37]), and Tl2201 (Ref. [38]) obtained
from ARPES data. See text for details.

showed that the ratio t^(′)/t is the essential material-dependent
parameter which is mainly controlled by the energy of the apical
orbital. It was also shown that for hole-doped HTS’s, the maximum
transition temperature for a particular superconducting family increases
with increasing t^(′)/t. In the inset of Fig. 6, we reproduce the
original figure from Ref. [9], where t^(′)/t obtained from local-density
approximation (LDA) band structure calculations is plotted as a function
of the plane Cu apical position distance for the single-layer HTS’s
La214, Bi2201, Tl2201, and Hg2201. In this figure, we also include the
values of t^(′)/t for Na-CCOC (x=0.10, 0.12), [36] La214, [37] and
Tl2201 (Ref. [38]) obtained from the analysis of angle resolved
photoemission (ARPES) data. It is seen that the t^(′)/t ratio for
Na-CCOC is very close to that of Bi2201.

In the next step, we compare the Na-CCOC data with those for the
structurally related compound La214. The general difference between them
is that Cl atoms, instead of oxygen atoms, occupy the apical positions
in Na-CCOC. In Fig. 7, we show the dependence of the zero-temperature
superfluid density ρ_(x)∝λ⁻²(0)∝σ_(sc)(0) as a function of p (p is the
number of holes per planar Cu) for Na-CCOC samples studied in the
present work and La214 from Ref. [28]. For clarity, we also add point
for x=0.18 Na-CCOC singe crystal sample studied by Kim _et al._[27] Note
that for both Na-CCOC and La214, p is just the magnitude of x. A
comparison of the superfluid density ρ_(s) of La214 and Na-CCOC at the
same level of doping reveals that in the latter one, ρ_(s) is reduced by
more than a factor of 2. Note that a pronounced difference between the
superfluid density of optimally doped La214 and Na-CCOC was also
mentioned by Kim _et al._[27] They conclude that the reduction of ρ_(s)
in Na-CCOC is due to a decrease of the charge carrier concentration
n_(s). We suggest the following reason for a possible decrease of n_(s):
The phase diagram of cuprates is usually interpreted in terms of holes
doped into the planar Cud_(x² − y²)-Op_(a) (α=x, y) antibonding band. In
La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄, it is assumed that one hole per Sr atom enters
this band. However, recent _ab initio_ calculations yielded additional
features appearing on doping of La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄. [39] According to
these calculations, part of the holes occupy the Cud_(32 − x²)-Op_(z)
orbitals. Experimentally, the existence of O 2p holes on the p_(z)
orbitals of the apical oxygen was observed for La214 by
polarization-dependent fluorescence yield absorption measurements [40]
and further supported by neutron diffraction studies. [41] In addition,
two superconducting condensates with d- and s-wave symmetries were
recently observed in slightly overdoped La_(1.83)Sr_(0.17)CuO₄. [42] It
was suggested that the s-wave contribution to the total superfluid
density arises from the out-of-plane band related with the
Cud_(32 − x²)-Op_(z) orbitals. [42] Bearing in mind that for each
particular HTS family the transition temperature T_(c) is determined by
the number of holes in the CuO₂ planes, the smaller superfluid density
in Na-CCOC in comparison with that in La214 can naturally be explained
by a substantial difference in the amount of apical holes in these
compounds.

### The Two-dimensional superfluid density of Ca_(2 − x)Na_(x)CuO₂Cl₂

In order to check further the 2D nature of Na-CCOC, we plot in Fig. 8
the transition temperature T_(c) as a function of the 2D superfluid
density, obtained as n_(x2D)/m^(*)=σ_(sc)(0)c_(sm), for the same HTS’s
as presented in Fig. 6 [c_(int) is the distance between the
superconducting CuO₂ planes: c_(im)=7.56 A for Na-CCOC, [15] 12.3 A for
Bi2201, [29] and ≈

Figure 8: (Color online) Dependence of the transition temperature T_(c)
on the 2D superfluid density n_(x2D)/m^(*)=σ_(sc)(0)c_(sm) for Na-CCOC
and various hole-doped HTS’s with oxygen on the apical site. Solid red
circles and blue stars are Na-CCOC data obtained in the present study.
The green circle is the data point for Na-CCOC (x=0.18) from Ref. [27].
Open squares are La214 data from Refs. [14] and [28]. Open triangles are
Bi2201 data taken from Ref. [29] and open circles are Y123 data from
Ref. [30]. The solid lines correspond to the power law with
σ_(sc)(0)c_(int)∝T_(c)^(1.6).

Figure 7: (Color online) σ_(sc)(0)∝λ_(ab)⁻² vs p (p is the number of
holes per planar Cu) for Na-CCOC studied in the present work (solid red
circles and blue stars), x=0.18 Na-CCOC from Kim _et al._ (Ref. [27])
(green circle), and La214 from Tallon _et al._ (Ref. [28]) (open
squares).

and La214 (Ref. [29]). As pointed out in Refs. [29] and [43], HTS’s with
a smaller c_(int) tend to have smaller n_(s2D)/m^(*) for a given T_(c).
Recalling the close similarities between Na-CCOC and Bi2201, one expects
that data points for these two systems would exhibit the same trend
(similar to what is observed in Fig. 6) so that the same n_(s2D)/m^(*)
for Na-CCOC and Bi2201 would correspond to similar values of transition
temperatures. It is seen, however, that the data points for Na-CCOC,
Y123, and La214 (except the data points for optimally doped and
overdoped La214 that are not shown) almost follow the same curve, while
those for Bi2201 exhibit a higher 2D superfluid density. This implies
that for the same values of n_(s2D)/m^(*), the transition temperature in
Na-CCOC is expected to be much higher than the corresponding T_(c) in
Bi2201 samples. However, as is seen in Fig. 6, for both Na-CCOC and
Bi2201 T_(c)’s are almost the same. Thus, the substitution of Cl on the
apical site leads not only to a pronounced 2D-like behavior due to a
reduction of the coupling between the superconducting CuO₂ planes but
also to a decrease of the transition temperature T_(c). This statement
was indeed confirmed in recent theoretical calculation of Yin and
Ku.[44] They showed, in particular, that due to much larger value of
−t^(′)/t, T_(c)^(max) is expected to be higher in Na-CCOC than in La214.
This is, however, completely opposite to the experimental observations
revealing T_(c)^(max)=28 K in Na-CCOC vs T_(c)^(max)=38 K in La214.

## V V. Conclusions

Ca_(2 − x)Na_(x)CuO₂Cl₂ is a structural analog to the
La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ superconductor with Cl atoms replacing oxygen on
the apical sites. In order to check the role of the apical oxygen for
high-temperature superconductivity, we performed μSR and magnetization
studies of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth λ_(ab) for
Ca_(2 − x)Na_(x)CuO₂Cl₂ samples with x ≈ 0.11, 0.12, 0.15, 0.18, and
0.19. The following results were obtained: The absolute value of the
in-plane magnetic penetration depth at T=0 was found to increase with
decreasing doping from λ_(ab)(0)=316(19) nm for the x = 0.19 sample to
λ_(ab)(0)=430(26) nm for the x = 0.11 one. Comparison of the superfluid
density ρ_(s) ∝ λ_(ab)⁻²(0) ∝ σ_(sc)(0) of Na-CCOC with that for the
structurally related La214 compound reveals that for the same doping
level, ρ_(s) in Na-CCOC is more than a factor of 2 smaller than in
La214. The reason for this is very likely due to a substantial decrease
of the amount of holes on the apical sites in Na-CCOC. Based on a
comparison of the three-dimensional [ρ_(s) ∝ σ_(sc)(0)] and the
two-dimensional [n_(s2D)/m^(*) = σ_(sc)(0)c_(int)] superfluid density of
Na-CCOC with that of Bi2201, it is concluded that replacing apical
oxygen by chlorine, first, decreases the coupling between the
superconducting CuO₂ planes and, second, leads to a substantial
reduction of the transition temperature T_(c). In addition, the
appearance and enhancement of magnetism with increasing magnetic field
was observed for the optimally doped Ca_(1.82)Na_(0.18)CuO₂Cl₂ sample,
suggesting that even optimally doped Na-CCOC has a competing magnetic
state very close in free energy to its superconducting state. In
conclusion, substitution of apical oxygen by chlorine strongly affects
the superconducting and the magnetic properties of the cuprate
superconductor Ca_(2 − x)Na_(x)CuO₂Cl₂.
