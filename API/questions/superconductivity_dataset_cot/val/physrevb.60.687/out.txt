###### Abstract

Attention has been paid to a (Bi10.33Cu0.67)Sr2YCu2Oy compound for its uncertain superconductivity in spite of having a large Cu valence. By conducting combined experiments of iodometry, and chlorinemetry, Hall voltage measurement, Rietveld analysis, and a Discrete vibrational (DV)-_X_a calculation for (Bi0.33Cu0.67)Sr2YCu2Oy, , evidence of localization of holes in a (Bi0.33Cu0.67)Oy block layer was found. Those experiments suggest that about 90% of holes estimated from the Mott-Hubbard theory are localized. DV-_X_a calculation revealed that the localized holes in (Bi0.33Cu0.67)Sr2YCu2Oy are not located at the apical or planar oxygen of a CuO2 layer but in the block layer. In order to transfer the localized holes from the block layer to the CuO2 layer, substitution of Mo for Bi was performed, resulting in an increase of the itinerant holes from 10 to 60 %. A bond valence sum calculation also suggested the transfer of holes from the block layer to the CuO2 layer with changes in occupancies of the oxygen sites in the block layer. Eventually, in a range of x >= 0.55, it showed superconductivity above 30 K. We also discuss the origin of nonsuperconductivity of cuprates with a high Cu valence. [S0163-1829(99)04025-4]

## 1 Introduction

Attention has been paid to (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase with a composition of (Bi1-_x_Cu)Sr2YCu2Oy for its uncertain superconductivity in spite of having a Cu valence large enough to induce superconductivity. The (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase was first prepared by Ehmann _et al._1 They reported that the compound is superconducting below a temperature of 68 K with a nominal composition of (Bi10.5Cu0.5)Sr2YCu2Oy. Unfortunately, it contains impurities including a Bi-2212 phase. Afterwards Wang _et al._2 reported that the superconductivity observed by Ehmann _et al._ is not due to the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase but due to the impurity. It was also reported that by sintering the powerful with a nominal composition of (Bi0.3Cu0.7)Sr2YCu2Oy, a nearly single phase of the (Bi, Cu)-1212 sample2,3 was prepared and that annealing the sample in oxygen with a pressure of 400 atm induced superconductivity below a temperature of 20 K.2 However, according to the X-ray diffraction (XRI) data observed by them, impurity peaks still remained in the prepared sample. The superconducting volume fraction estimated from a Meissner signal at 5 K was as small as 1.5%. Therefore, there is the possibility that superconductivity comes from such impurities, not from the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase.

In a previous paper,4 we reported the successful preparation of the (Bi1-_x_Cu)Sr2YCu2Oy phase. In order to obtain the pure single phase sample, controls of nominal composition and sintering atmosphere were required. We also reported that a single phase of (Bi,Cu)-1212 is not superconducting but semiconducting in spite of having a high Cu valence larger than 2.1. Now, it is interesting to examine the origin of the nonsuperconductivity of the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase.

In this paper, we first focused our study on the origin of nonsuperconductivity of (Bi1-_x_Cu)Sr2YCu2Oy. We confirmed the preparing condition of (Bi1-_x_Cu)Sr2YCu2Oy, refined its crystal structure by Rietveld analysis, measured its hole density, and calculated electronic states of the CuO2 layer by DV-_X_a calculation, revealing that 90% of the holes are localized in the block layer.

Secondly, based on these results, we tried to make (Bi1-_x_Cu)Sr2YCu2Oy superconducting by substitution of Bi for the other transition metals. We found that Mo is the most helpful element for occurrence of superconductivity. A solid solution [(Bi1-_x_Mo)0.33Cu0.67]Sr2YCu2Oy was prepared for 0 <= x <= 1.0. From the resistivity measurements as a function of temperature, superconductivity was shown in the region of 0.55 <= 1.0. Mo substitution increased the itinerant holes from 10 to 60 %, resulting in superconductivity above 37 K.

Finally, we discuss the origin of nonsuperconductivity of cuprates with a Cu valence larger than 2.1. Part of the results have already been published in Refs. 4-6.

## 2 Experiment

Samples of (Bi1-_x_Cu)Sr2YCu2Oy (0.5 <= x <= 0.8) and [(Bi1-_x_Mo)0.33Cu0.67]Sr2YCu2Oy (0.0 <= x <= 1.0) were prepared by a conventional mixing method.4 As shown in Fig. 1, a pellet was prepared by mixing Bi2O3, SrCO3, Y2O3, CuO, and MoO3 in an agate mortar, calcining at 850-900 degC in air for 5-10 h, grinding it in the mortar again, pressing it into a pellet, and then sintering at 980 degC in air for 20-60 h. After sintering, the pellet was quenched to a room temperature on a metal plate or cooled slowly in a furnace. After grinding it to powder, a single phase of the (Bi,Cu)-1212 powder was ascertained by an XRD method. In order to obtain an optimum hole concentration, oxygen content was varied by annealing in an atmosphere of N2 or O2.

The cation ratio of the prepared sample determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectroscopy measurement was consistent with the nominal ratio within 5%. Its structural parameters were determined by a Rietveld analysis (rietan).7 Errors of oxygen occupancy O(1)-O(4) were estimated from the standard deviation. We assumed that the blocking layer has two oxygen sites O(3) and O(4) and refined occupancies of the O(3) and O(4) sites by the Rietveld analysis with fixing total oxygen content.

The total oxygen content was determined by an iodometric method. Bi and Cu valences were determined separately by combining the iodometric and the chlorine production method.8 Here, the valence of Mo is assumed to be Mo(VI), respectively. If a Mo(II or V) is to exist, the Cu valence should be corrected. According to the Mott-Hubbard theory, by subtracting 2 from the Cu valence, a number of holes per Cu v was calculated.

Since the v represents an average number of holes per Cu, if the valence of Cu in the (Bi,Cu,O) layer is different from that in the CuO2 layer, the number of holes in the (Bi,Cu,O) layer or CuO2 layer should be corrected. Nevertheless, the whole number of holes per unit cell is not changed, even though the Cu in the (Bi,Cu,O) layer has a different valence than that in the CuO2 layer. Therefore, we can estimate the whole number of holes v in a unit cell correctly from the Cu valence.

Resistivity-temperature curves (10 K  T  300 K) were measured by a conventional four-probe method. The superconducting properties were also determined by measuring the temperature dependence of ac magnetic susceptibility, by the field cooling method (Meissner effect). The magnetic field of 2 Oe with a frequency of 313 Hz was applied to the reground sample.

For the Hall voltage measurement, low resistance contacts to the sample (about 8 mm x 5 mm x 1 mm in size) were made by using conducting silver paste. A four-wire ac resistance bridge (LR-400, Linear Research, Inc.) was used for measuring Hall voltage across the Hall terminals. A current of 1-10 mA was flowed through the sample and the applied magnetic field strength was fixed at +-1.5 T.

From the Hall coefficient R_{H}, hole density n_{H} was induced from the following equation:

\[n_{H} = \frac{1}{qR_{H}},\]

where q represents the elementary electric charge. Assuming that the holes are located in the CuO2 layer, the number of holes per Cu p is calculated by

\[p = \frac{n_{H}V}{s},\]

where V and s represent the unit cell volume and the number of Cu in the unit cell, respectively. The ratio of delocalized holes r was estimated by the equation

\[r = \frac{p}{v},\]

where u represents the number of holes per Cu estimated from the Cu valence by the Mott-Hubbard theory and is determined by the following equation:

\[v = ({\rm Cu\kern0.5em}\kern0.5em)\kern-0.5em({\rm Cu\kern0.5em}\kern0.5em)-2.\]

The numerical computation was carried out by a DV-_X_a_ method.9 The exchange parameter a is fixed at 0.7 through all calculations. The numerical atomic orbitals of _1s_*_4p for Cu and of 1_s_*_2p for O are utilized for basis functions of the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO).

## III Results and Discussion

### (Bi_{1-x}Cu_{x})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} phase

_Preparation of (Bi_{1-x}Cu_{x})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y}._ Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show XRD patterns of (Bi,Cu)-1212 samples synthesized under slowly cooled and quenched conditions, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, impurity phases such as Bi-2212, Cu_{2}Y_{2}O_{5}, and SrY_{2}O_{4} were drastically decreased by the quenching treatment. Therefore, all the samples hereafter were fabricated by the quenching method.

In order to confirm an optimum Bi/Cu ratio, the x value in the (Bi_{1-x}Cu_{x})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} phase was successively changed between 0.5 and 0.8. Figure 3 shows the change in XRD peaks as a function of x, showing that in a very narrow region around x = 0.67, a single phase of the (Bi,Cu)-1212 sample was prepared.

For the oxygen-annealed sample of (Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} , Rietveld analysis was carried out. Refined crystallographic data for this sample are displayed in Fig. 4 and Table I. The interatomic distances are listed in Table II. We assumed that the blocking layer has two oxygen sites O(3) and O(4), as shown in Fig. 5. Reliability factor _R__w__p_ for the model was 5.79%, indicating that this model is an appropriate one. The model is comparable to that proposed by Wang _et al._,2 except for its oxygen content. While they fixed its oxygen content to be 7.5, we fixed it to be 6.9 from the result of iodometry. A structural feature of this sample is existence of double CuO_{2} planes with an apical oxygen, separated from each other by Y layer. This structure is commonly seen in high-_T__c_ superconductors with T_{c} values higher than 80 K such as a YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} superconductor. Therefore, it is expected that the (Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{6.9} induces superconductivity with a T_{c} higher than 80 K.

As shown in Fig. 6, by changing the annealing atmosphere, oxygen content was varied from 6.77 to 6.88 together with a change in the Cu valence from 2.04 to 2.13. A Bi valence against oxygen content y is also displayed in Fig. 6, indicating that an increase in oxygen content did not raise the Bi valence: the Bi valence was about 3.29 for all the samples while the Cu valence was varied between 2.04 and 2.13. From the fact that the Cu valence 2.13 is equal to that of a 60-K-class YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.76} superconductor, we think that the Cu valence 2.13 is large enough to induce superconductivity and that optimization of the Cu valence for occurrence of

 superconductivity is achieved for this sample. In Fig. 7, the dependence of resistivity on temperature is shown. An increase in the oxygen content y from 6.77 to 6.88 led to a drastic decrease in resistivity from 2.06\times 10^{2} to 1.35\times 10^{-1}\Omega cm at 100 K. However, the sample, whose Cu valence was optimized to be 2.13, was not superconducting but still semiconducting.

According to the Hall effect measurement, the hole density of the oxygen-annealed sample was 3.6\times 10^{20} cm^{-3} at room temperature. This value is much smaller than 3.1\times 10^{21} cm^{-3} for a YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.76} sample.[10] In Fig. 8, the hole density n_{H} and the ratio of itinerant holes p/v are shown. With an increase in the Cu valence from 2.08 to 2.16, the hole density was increased from 1.0\times 10^{19} to 3.6\times 10^{20} cm^{-3}. These values of hole density measured by the Hall effect measurement are much smaller than those calculated by the Mott-Hubbard model assuming that an increase in the Cu valence from 2.0 to 3.0 dopes one hole to the Cu ion [represented by a broken line in Fig. 8(a)], resulting that the hole density measured by the Hall voltage measurement did not reach the hatched optimum hole density region, necessary for the occurrence of superconductivity. In spite of the optimization of the Cu valence for the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase, its hole density was extremely small in comparison with the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.76} superconductor. Therefore, it is revealed that holes induced by the excess oxygen are not doped to the CuO_{2} plane sufficiently. While the ratio of itinerant holes p/v in Bi-based superconductors was as large as 100-200 %,[20] the ratio of the N_{2}-, air-, and O_{2}-annealed (Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} specimens was 0.02, 3, and 14 %, respectively [Fig. 8(b)], indicating that the majority of holes are localized somewhere.

The first site where holes may be localized is apical oxygen. The distance between the apical oxygen and the CuO_{2} plane of the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase is about 2.28 A, which is 0.15 A shorter than that of the Bi-2212 phase. The extremely short Cu-O(apex) distance may localize holes at the apical

  oxygen and suppress its superconductivity. The second site is in the (Bi,Cu)O_{1+z} layer. We estimated the Cu valence to be 2.13. This is indeed the case if the Cu(1) and the Cu(2) valences are equal. If the valence of the Cu(1) atom in the (Bi,Cu)O_{1+z} plane is larger than the expected one, the hole density in the CuO_{2} plane will be smaller than the estimated value 2.13. Furthermore, the Bi valence in the (Bi,Cu)O_{1+z} layer of the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase is 3.29, which is relatively high compared with 3.03-3.17, those of the Bi-2212 superconductors,[11] suggesting that the holes may be localized in the (Bi,Cu)O_{1+z} layer. In order to elucidate where the holes are localized, electronic states of the CuO_{2} layer were calculated by a DV-X\alpha molecular orbital calculation method.

_Simulation of electronic structure of (Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} by the DV-X\alpha method._ We believe that the nonsuperconductivity of the (Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} is strongly correlated with the microstructure of the CuO_{2} layer. Consequently, the DV-X\alpha method was applied to a distorted pyramidal CuO_{5} cluster in the (Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y}. The structure of the CuO_{5} cluster is shown in Fig. 9. Three structural parameters used for the CuO_{5} cluster are the Cu-O(plane) length, the Cu-O(apex) length, and buckling. The symmetrized orbital of the C_{4}V group was used. By changing the total electron number in the CuO_{5} cluster, the hole density was controlled by changing the number of total electrons in the cluster. We used O_{1s}-O_{2p} and Cu_{1s}-Cu_{4p} orbitals as the ground state function.

In this case, only the pyramidal CuO_{5} cluster was considered for the calculation and no external electric field was considered. The electronic states of the CuO_{5} cluster in the Bi-2212 and Y-123 superconductors were compared with that of (Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y}. In particular, we focused our calculation on the localization of holes at apical oxygen. The structural parameters of the Bi-2212 and Y-123 superconductors were cited from Imai _et al._[12] and Izumi _et al._[13], respectively. In this calculation, 0.16 of holes were doped into the (Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y}, Bi-2212, and Y-123 phases. Thus, the calculation for (CuO_{3})^{-7.84} was carried out. All parameters of the CuO_{5} cluster used for DV-X\alpha calculation are listed in Table 3.

The molecular orbital energy levels near the Fermi level (E_{r}) calculated by the DV-X\alpha method are shown in Fig. 10. Here, the solid and dashed lines correspond to the occupied and the unoccupied orbitals, respectively. The notations at the right side such as 8A1, 4E, etc., denote the irreducible representation of the C4_v_ point group and the sequential number of each irreducible group. The molecular orbital with the same notation is connected by the dashed and dotted lines. First of all, we are aware that the change in the sequence of molecular orbitals for each model is small. This is because the electronic structure is not largely changed by the slight changes in geometry between the models for the (Bi, Cu)-1212, Bi-2201, and Y-123 systems. Especially, the hole doped level is the 5B1 state for all clusters, which are constituted by the hybridized Cu3d_{x2-y2} and O2p_{xy} orbitals of planar oxygens. Therefore, not only for the Bi-2212 and Y-123 superconductors but for the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase, a hole located in the CuO_{5} cluster is doped to the Cu-O(plane) orbital, resulting in holes that will be contributed to the electric conduction.

The hole distribution on each element was calculated from effective charges obtained by a Mulliken population analysis.[9] Here, the hole number is defined by the subtraction of the formal charge from the effective charge. The hole

  numbers thus obtained are listed in Table 4. The doped holes were mainly distributed to the O(plane) while a few holes were distributed to the O(apex) and Cu(plane). However, a slight difference exists in the hole distribution to the O(apex). About 10% of the doped hole is distributed to the O(apex) site for the (Bi,Cu)-1212 and Bi-2212 phases, while about 20% of the doped holes are distributed to that for the Y-123 phase. In order to make clear the cause for the hole distribution to the O(apex) of the Y-123 to be twice as large as that for (Bi,Cu)-1212 or Bi-2212, the parameters of the Cu-O(plane) length, Cu-O(apex) length, and buckling were varied independently. As a result, a decrease in the Cu-O(apex) length was found to be the most effective for an increase in the hole at the O(apex) site. Increasing both the Cu-O(plane) length and buckling of the O-Cu-O(plane) were less effective for the increase in the hole at the O(apex) site.

From the DV-\chi\alpha calculation, it is found that if a hole is doped to the CuO_{5} cluster, the holes will be located at the Cu-O(plane) orbital, resulting in the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase showing a metallic property. Considering that the hole density measured by the Hall effect is much smaller than that calculated by the Mott-Hubbard model as described above, it is suggested that a hole is not doped to the CuO_{5} cluster but localized in the (Bi,Cu)O, block layer. Thus, the origin of nonsuperconductivity of (Bi,Cu)-1212 is found to be localization of holes in the block layer. It is promising to substitute the blocking layer for another element to inhibit the localization of holes in the (Bi,Cu)O_{2} block layer.

**B. [M_{{\bf 0},{\bf 3}}Cu_{{\bf 0},{\bf 6}}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y}**

As described above, it was found that [Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} does not exhibit superconductivity because of the localization of holes in the block layer. So, we tried to make the [Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} superconducting by substitution of Bi for the other elements. We examined various metal elements for the substitution of Bi. We referred to the compounds of (_M_{x}_Cu_{1-x}_)Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} (Refs. [14 and 15]) to choose the most promising element (_M_ = Li, Co, Ni, Zn, Ph, Al, Ga, In, As, Cr, Fe, Ge, Sn, Se, Ti, Zr, Ru, Pt, V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, Re, and Os).

When the element, M was Co, Al, Ga, Fe, Ti, Cr, Ge, V, Mo, W, and Re, a single phase of 1212 phase was formed. Among these single-phase compounds, that with M = Mo exhibited superconductivity above 30 K as shown in Fig. 11.

**C. [(Bi_{1-x}Mo_{x})_{{\bf 0},{\bf 3}}Cu_{{\bf 0},{\bf 6}}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y}**

From the result of Sec. IV.2, a solid solution between the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase and the (Mo,Cu)-1212 phase appears to be suitable for inducing superconductivity. Therefore, we ex

  amined a range of the solid solution represented by x in [(Bi_{1-x}Mo_{x})_{0.33}Cu_{0.67}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y}. Figure 12 shows the XRD patterns for (Bi,Mo,Cu)-1212 samples prepared under various Bi/Mo ratios (0 <= x <= 1.0). In the range 0 <= x <= 1.0, no peaks attributable to impurity were observed, indicating that a single phase of the (Bi,Mo,Cu)-1212 was prepared in a whole range between (Bi0,33Cu0.67)-1212 and (Mo0.33Cu0.67)-1212.

For the (Bi,Mo,Cu)-1212 phases, dependence of resistivity on temperature is shown in Fig. 13(a). The resistivity of a Mo-free (_x_ = 0) sample was so large that its resistivity was plotted with a scale of 0.1. The substitution of Mo for Bi led to a drastic decrease in resistivity. Finally, when x went up to over 0.55, a superconducting transition was observed. In Fig. 13(b), dependence of magnetic susceptibility on temperature is shown, revealing that bulk superconductivity is observed for samples with x = 0.8 and 1.0.

In order to estimate the volume fraction of the Meissner effect of the [(Bi_{1-x}Mo_{x})_{0.33}Cu_{0.67}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} (_x_ = 0) superconductor, we compared that with that of the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} superconductor. While the drop of the output by the Meissner effect of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} was - 6.0x10^{-3} V/g at 22 K, that of [(Bi_{1-x}Mo_{x})_{0.33}Cu_{0.67}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} (_x_ = 0) was - 2.0 x10^{-3} V/g at 22 K, indicating that the volume fraction of the Meissner effect of [(Bi_{1-x}Mo_{x})_{0.33}Cu_{0.67}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} (_x_ = 0) was as large as one-third of that of the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} at 22 K. Even if the volume fraction of the Meissner effect of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} is as low as 30% at 22 K, which is considered to be the lowest estimation for the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} superconductor, that of the [(Bi_{1-x}Mo_{x})_{0.33}Cu_{0.67}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} (_x_ = 0) is estimated to be larger than 10%. Therefore, the [(Bi_{1-x}Mo_{x})_{0.33}Cu_{0.67}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} is found to be a bulk superconductor.

A correlation between the substitution ratio x and transition temperature (T_{c}^{\rm on}) is shown in Fig. 14. Superconductivity

  ity is observed for the sample with 0.55 <= x <= 1.0. In particular, for the samples with x = 0.55 - 1.0, the maximum _T_cen above 30 K was attained.

In order to clarify whether or not the Mo substitution delocalizes holes in the block layer, oxygen contents and Cu valences of the [(Bi1-Mo)0.33Cu0.67]Sr2YCu2Oy samples were measured. As shown in Fig. 15, the oxygen content y was increased with an increase in x, although there was a slight drop for the sample with x = 0.6. On the other hand, the Cu valence once increased with an increase in x from 0 to 0.2 in the [(Bi1-_x_Mo)0.33Cu0.67]Sr2YCu2Oy. However, a further increase in x above 0.2 led to a decrease in the Cu valence. Here, the valences of Bi and Mo are assumed to be Bi(III) and Mo(VI), respectively. In Fig. 16, the values of _T_cen were plotted against the Cu valence, showing that the maximum _T_cen of 37 K is obtained for the sample with a Cu valence of 2.19. Since the whole curve appears to be bell shaped as was frequently observed in high-_T_cen superconductors,6,16-18 the samples, whose Cu valence is over 2.21, should be overdoped and metallic. Nevertheless, the electronic property of such samples was not metallic but semiconducting, suggesting that the samples are in the underdoped region. Therefore, it is difficult to explain the change in _T_c simply by a change in the Cu valence.

We measured hole density (_nH_) at room temperature from the Hall coefficient. As shown in Fig. 17, with an increase in Mo substitution, x led to an increase in the hole density (_nH_). Superconductivity occurs when _nH_ exceeds 1.0 x 1021/cm3. Based on the Mott-Hubbard theory, it has been believed that an increase in the hole density leads to an increase in the Cu valence. For the [(Bi1-_x_Mo)0.33Cu0.67]Sr2YCu2Oy phase, however, the increase in the hole density led to a decrease in the Cu valence, indicating that a Cu valence is not an appropriate barometer for estimating its hole density.

For the purpose of investigating the cause of the behavior against the Mott-Hubbard theory, Rietveld analysis8 was carried out for all the (Bi,Mo,Cu)-1212 samples. For example, a

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} Atom & Site & x & y & z & Occupancy & B [Å2] \\ Bi & 1a & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.1485 & 0.5 \\ Mo & 1a & 0 & 0 & 0.1815 & 0.5 \\ Cu(1) & 1a & 0 & 0 & 0.67 & 0.5 \\ Sr & 2h & 1/2 & 1/2 & 0.1972 & 1 & 0.5 \\ Y & 1d & 1/2 & 1/2 & 1/2 & 1 & 0.2 \\ Cu(2) & 2g & 0 & 0 & 0.355(4) & 1 & 0.5 \\ O(1) & 4i & 0 & 1/2 & 0.375(2) & 0.98 & 0.5 \\ O(2) & 2g & 0 & 0 & 0.169(8) & 0.90 & 1.5 \\ O(3) & 1c & 1/2 & 1/2 & 0 & 0.41 & 1.5 \\ O(4) & 2f & 0 & 1/2 & 0  result of the analysis for the x\!=\!0.55 sample is displayed in Fig. 18 and Table 5. In Fig. 18, the dotted and solid lines represent the observed and calculated XRD patterns, respectively. The pattern at the bottom of the figure shows the difference between the observed and calculated intensities at the same diffraction angle. Table 5 shows crystallographic data for this sample. Since the reliability factor for the analysis was R_{wp}\!=\!6.81\%, the proposed model appears to be an appropriate one. Its structure is composed of layers with (Bi,Mo,Cu)O_{1+z}, SrO, CuO_{2}, and Y. It is isostructural with that of the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase (Fig. 5) except the partial substitution of Mo for Bi,Cu(1) site. From the structure refined by the Rietveld analysis, the lattice parameters of this system were plotted against the component ratio x (Fig. 19). While an a-axis length of the (Bi, Mo, Cu)-1212 phase was slightly increased with an increase in x, its c-axis length was decreased. However, any anomalous change in the a- and c-axis length at a value around 0.55 was not observed. On the other hand, it was found that occupancy of the oxygen sites in the block layer was remarkably changed with varying the x value. As shown in Fig. 5, there are two sorts of oxygen sites in the block layer. One is the O(3) site located in the facial center, and the other is the O(4) site located on the line between the {Bi,Mo,Cu(1)} sites. In Fig. 20, oxygen occupancies of the O(3) and O(4) sites against x in [(Bi_{1-x}Mo_{x})_{0.33}Cu_{0.67}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} was displayed. It is difficult to determine the oxygen site occupancy exactly from Rietveld analysis using x-ray diffraction data. However, the standard deviations of the oxygen occupancy were smaller than 10%, indicating that a systematic change in the occupancy with varying x was found. While occupancy of the O(3) site decreases with an increase in x, that of the O(4) site increases. Since the superconductivity is observed for the samples with 0.55\leqx\!\leq\!1.0, the oxygen in the O(4) site with the occupancy over 0.5 may be crucial for appearance of superconductivity. Further it was found that the distance between the apical oxygen and the Cu(2) was remarkably changed. The distance between the apical oxygen O(2) and

  Cu(2) as a function of x is displayed in Fig. 21. While the O(2)-Cu(2) distance was decreased from 2.30 to 2.15 A with an increase in x from 0 to 0.55, it was increased from 2.15 to 2.21 A with a further increase in x from 0.55 to 1.0. Considering that superconductivity appears in the region of x >= 0.55, where the Cu(2)-O(2) distance increases with the increase in x, the distance between Cu(plane) and O(apex) may be correlated with the occurrence of superconductivity.

In order to elucidate correlation between the electronic structure of the block layer and the change in the structure of the block layer, a bond valence sum (BVS) calculation was carried out.19 In Fig. 22, the BVS of mixed (Bi,Mo,Cu) valence is plotted against the x in \left\{\left. \text{(Bi}_{1-x}\text{Mo}_{x}\right)_{0.35}\text{Cu}_{0.67}\right\}\text{Sr}_{2}\text{YCu}_{2}\text{O}_{y}\right., clearly indicating that the BVS is drastically decreased with an increase in x. It is quite different from the formal valence drawn on the assumption that Cu, Bi, and Mo are 2+, 3+, and 6+, respectively. It is found that superconductivity occurs in the x region where the BVS is smaller than the formal valence, suggesting that Mo substitution for Bi moves localized holes to the CuO2 layer in connection with changes in the occupancies of O(3) and O(4) in the block layer. It seems that our results are consistent with the band calculation data saying that a chemical state of the Bi is strongly affected by the structure in the block layer.20,21 We believe that this is the origin of superconductivity for the (Bi,Mo,Cu)-1212 phase.

### Nonsuperconducting cuprates

Various nonsuperconducting cuprates with a Cu valence over 2.1 are listed in Table 6. We have already clarified that nonsuperconductivity of BaLaRuCuO5.13,22 (Bi0.33Cu0.67)Sr_{2}YCu2O6.79, and Eu1.3Ba1.5Cu3O7 (Ref. 23) comes from localization of holes and that the localization of holes is originated from the absence and CuO2 sheet, the high BVS of the (Bi0.33Cu0.67) site and Cu(1) site, respectively. Further, nonsuperconductivity of PrBa2Cu3O7 is believed to come from hybridization of the Pr4_if_ and O2_p_p_ orbitals.24 Since these cuprates except BaLaRuCuO5.13 have CuO2 sheets in structure, if the trapped holes are delocalized, the cuprates will become metallic and probably superconducting.

It is well known that the treatment under high pressure oxygen has an effect on doping holes to the cuprates. By the treatment, many cuprates such as a (La,Sr)2CaCu2Oy and (Cu,C)Ba2CaCu2Oy induced superconductivity. We would like to emphasize that substitution of an element in the block layer also takes effect on a occurrence of superconductivity as well as the high pressure oxygen treatment. The (Bi,Mo, Cu)-1212 phase is one of the cases.

On the other hand, La4BaCu5O13 and La5SrCu6O15 cuprates are metallic by themselves, indicating almost all holes are originally delocalized. Accordingly, the cause of nonsuperconductivity of these cuprates are considered to be their three-dimensional Cu-O network, suggesting that the CuO2 sheets are essential to the occurrence of superconductivity. At this stage, we are not sure how to make these metallic cuprates superconducting.

## IV Conclusion

A single phase of the (Bi,Cu)-1212 was successfully prepared. Two indispensable keys to prepare a single phase of (Bi,Cu)-1212 were to quench the sample after sintering, and to control x in a very narrow region around x = 0.67 in the (Bi1-_x_Cu,x)Sr2YCu2Oy.

From a Rietveld analysis, it was confirmed that the compound has a double CuO2 plane. Annealing the sample in an atmosphere of oxygen led to an increase in the Cu valence as large as 2.13. However, the sample was not superconducting but semiconducting.

By combined experiments of a hole density measurement and a DV-_X__a_ calculation, it was revealed that holes for the achievement of superconductivity were not doped to the CuO2 plane sufficiently but were localized in the (Bi,Cu)O1++, plane. In order to make the (Bi,Cu)-1212 superconducting (Bi,Mo,Cu)-1212 solid solution was prepared for 0<_x_<1.0 in \left[ \left( \text{Bi}_{1-x}\text{Mo}_{x}\right)_{0.35}\text{Cu}_{0.67}\right]Sr2YCu2Oy. The samples in the region of 0.55<_x_<1.0 showed superconductivity. However, the appearance of superconductivity cannot be explained only by a change in the Cu valence. Instead, it was found that the bond valence sum of the block layer was drastically changed with changes in occupancies of the oxygen sites O(3) and O(4) and the Cu(2)-O(2) distance, which may be the origin of superconductivity.

###### Abstract

Attention has been paid to a (Bi10.33Cu0.67)Sr2YCu2Oy compound for its uncertain superconductivity in spite of having a large Cu valence. By conducting combined experiments of iodometry, and chlorinemetry, Hall voltage measurement, Rietveld analysis, and a Discrete vibrational (DV)-_X_a calculation for (Bi0.33Cu0.67)Sr2YCu2Oy, , evidence of localization of holes in a (Bi0.33Cu0.67)Oy block layer was found. Those experiments suggest that about 90% of holes estimated from the Mott-Hubbard theory are localized. DV-_X_a calculation revealed that the localized holes in (Bi0.33Cu0.67)Sr2YCu2Oy are not located at the apical or planar oxygen of a CuO2 layer but in the block layer. In order to transfer the localized holes from the block layer to the CuO2 layer, substitution of Mo for Bi was performed, resulting in an increase of the itinerant holes from 10 to 60 %. A bond valence sum calculation also suggested the transfer of holes from the block layer to the CuO2 layer with changes in occupancies of the oxygen sites in the block layer. Eventually, in a range of x >= 0.55, it showed superconductivity above 30 K. We also discuss the origin of nonsuperconductivity of cuprates with a high Cu valence. [S0163-1829(99)04025-4]

## 1 Introduction

Attention has been paid to (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase with a composition of (Bi1-_x_Cu)Sr2YCu2Oy for its uncertain superconductivity in spite of having a Cu valence large enough to induce superconductivity. The (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase was first prepared by Ehmann _et al._1 They reported that the compound is superconducting below a temperature of 68 K with a nominal composition of (Bi10.5Cu0.5)Sr2YCu2Oy. Unfortunately, it contains impurities including a Bi-2212 phase. Afterwards Wang _et al._2 reported that the superconductivity observed by Ehmann _et al._ is not due to the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase but due to the impurity. It was also reported that by sintering the powerful with a nominal composition of (Bi0.3Cu0.7)Sr2YCu2Oy, a nearly single phase of the (Bi, Cu)-1212 sample2,3 was prepared and that annealing the sample in oxygen with a pressure of 400 atm induced superconductivity below a temperature of 20 K.2 However, according to the X-ray diffraction (XRI) data observed by them, impurity peaks still remained in the prepared sample. The superconducting volume fraction estimated from a Meissner signal at 5 K was as small as 1.5%. Therefore, there is the possibility that superconductivity comes from such impurities, not from the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase.

In a previous paper,4 we reported the successful preparation of the (Bi1-_x_Cu)Sr2YCu2Oy phase. In order to obtain the pure single phase sample, controls of nominal composition and sintering atmosphere were required. We also reported that a single phase of (Bi,Cu)-1212 is not superconducting but semiconducting in spite of having a high Cu valence larger than 2.1. Now, it is interesting to examine the origin of the nonsuperconductivity of the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase.

In this paper, we first focused our study on the origin of nonsuperconductivity of (Bi1-_x_Cu)Sr2YCu2Oy. We confirmed the preparing condition of (Bi1-_x_Cu)Sr2YCu2Oy, refined its crystal structure by Rietveld analysis, measured its hole density, and calculated electronic states of the CuO2 layer by DV-_X_a calculation, revealing that 90% of the holes are localized in the block layer.

Secondly, based on these results, we tried to make (Bi1-_x_Cu)Sr2YCu2Oy superconducting by substitution of Bi for the other transition metals. We found that Mo is the most helpful element for occurrence of superconductivity. A solid solution [(Bi1-_x_Mo)0.33Cu0.67]Sr2YCu2Oy was prepared for 0 <= x <= 1.0. From the resistivity measurements as a function of temperature, superconductivity was shown in the region of 0.55 <= 1.0. Mo substitution increased the itinerant holes from 10 to 60 %, resulting in superconductivity above 37 K.

Finally, we discuss the origin of nonsuperconductivity of cuprates with a Cu valence larger than 2.1. Part of the results have already been published in Refs. 4-6.

## 2 Experiment

Samples of (Bi1-_x_Cu)Sr2YCu2Oy (0.5 <= x <= 0.8) and [(Bi1-_x_Mo)0.33Cu0.67]Sr2YCu2Oy (0.0 <= x <= 1.0) were prepared by a conventional mixing method.4 As shown in Fig. 1, a pellet was prepared by mixing Bi2O3, SrCO3, Y2O3, CuO, and MoO3 in an agate mortar, calcining at 850-900 degC in air for 5-10 h, grinding it in the mortar again, pressing it into a pellet, and then sintering at 980 degC in air for 20-60 h. After sintering, the pellet was quenched to a room temperature on a metal plate or cooled slowly in a furnace. After grinding it to powder, a single phase of the (Bi,Cu)-1212 powder was ascertained by an XRD method. In order to obtain an optimum hole concentration, oxygen content was varied by annealing in an atmosphere of N2 or O2.

The cation ratio of the prepared sample determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectroscopy measurement was consistent with the nominal ratio within 5%. Its structural parameters were determined by a Rietveld analysis (rietan).7 Errors of oxygen occupancy O(1)-O(4) were estimated from the standard deviation. We assumed that the blocking layer has two oxygen sites O(3) and O(4) and refined occupancies of the O(3) and O(4) sites by the Rietveld analysis with fixing total oxygen content.

The total oxygen content was determined by an iodometric method. Bi and Cu valences were determined separately by combining the iodometric and the chlorine production method.8 Here, the valence of Mo is assumed to be Mo(VI), respectively. If a Mo(II or V) is to exist, the Cu valence should be corrected. According to the Mott-Hubbard theory, by subtracting 2 from the Cu valence, a number of holes per Cu v was calculated.

Since the v represents an average number of holes per Cu, if the valence of Cu in the (Bi,Cu,O) layer is different from that in the CuO2 layer, the number of holes in the (Bi,Cu,O) layer or CuO2 layer should be corrected. Nevertheless, the whole number of holes per unit cell is not changed, even though the Cu in the (Bi,Cu,O) layer has a different valence than that in the CuO2 layer. Therefore, we can estimate the whole number of holes v in a unit cell correctly from the Cu valence.

Resistivity-temperature curves (10 K  T  300 K) were measured by a conventional four-probe method. The superconducting properties were also determined by measuring the temperature dependence of ac magnetic susceptibility, by the field cooling method (Meissner effect). The magnetic field of 2 Oe with a frequency of 313 Hz was applied to the reground sample.

For the Hall voltage measurement, low resistance contacts to the sample (about 8 mm x 5 mm x 1 mm in size) were made by using conducting silver paste. A four-wire ac resistance bridge (LR-400, Linear Research, Inc.) was used for measuring Hall voltage across the Hall terminals. A current of 1-10 mA was flowed through the sample and the applied magnetic field strength was fixed at +-1.5 T.

From the Hall coefficient R_{H}, hole density n_{H} was induced from the following equation:

\[n_{H} = \frac{1}{qR_{H}},\]

where q represents the elementary electric charge. Assuming that the holes are located in the CuO2 layer, the number of holes per Cu p is calculated by

\[p = \frac{n_{H}V}{s},\]

where V and s represent the unit cell volume and the number of Cu in the unit cell, respectively. The ratio of delocalized holes r was estimated by the equation

\[r = \frac{p}{v},\]

where u represents the number of holes per Cu estimated from the Cu valence by the Mott-Hubbard theory and is determined by the following equation:

\[v = ({\rm Cu\kern0.5em}\kern0.5em)\kern-0.5em({\rm Cu\kern0.5em}\kern0.5em)-2.\]

The numerical computation was carried out by a DV-_X_a_ method.9 The exchange parameter a is fixed at 0.7 through all calculations. The numerical atomic orbitals of _1s_*_4p for Cu and of 1_s_*_2p for O are utilized for basis functions of the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO).

## III Results and Discussion

### (Bi_{1-x}Cu_{x})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} phase

_Preparation of (Bi_{1-x}Cu_{x})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y}._ Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show XRD patterns of (Bi,Cu)-1212 samples synthesized under slowly cooled and quenched conditions, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, impurity phases such as Bi-2212, Cu_{2}Y_{2}O_{5}, and SrY_{2}O_{4} were drastically decreased by the quenching treatment. Therefore, all the samples hereafter were fabricated by the quenching method.

In order to confirm an optimum Bi/Cu ratio, the x value in the (Bi_{1-x}Cu_{x})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} phase was successively changed between 0.5 and 0.8. Figure 3 shows the change in XRD peaks as a function of x, showing that in a very narrow region around x = 0.67, a single phase of the (Bi,Cu)-1212 sample was prepared.

For the oxygen-annealed sample of (Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} , Rietveld analysis was carried out. Refined crystallographic data for this sample are displayed in Fig. 4 and Table I. The interatomic distances are listed in Table II. We assumed that the blocking layer has two oxygen sites O(3) and O(4), as shown in Fig. 5. Reliability factor _R__w__p_ for the model was 5.79%, indicating that this model is an appropriate one. The model is comparable to that proposed by Wang _et al._,2 except for its oxygen content. While they fixed its oxygen content to be 7.5, we fixed it to be 6.9 from the result of iodometry. A structural feature of this sample is existence of double CuO_{2} planes with an apical oxygen, separated from each other by Y layer. This structure is commonly seen in high-_T__c_ superconductors with T_{c} values higher than 80 K such as a YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} superconductor. Therefore, it is expected that the (Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{6.9} induces superconductivity with a T_{c} higher than 80 K.

As shown in Fig. 6, by changing the annealing atmosphere, oxygen content was varied from 6.77 to 6.88 together with a change in the Cu valence from 2.04 to 2.13. A Bi valence against oxygen content y is also displayed in Fig. 6, indicating that an increase in oxygen content did not raise the Bi valence: the Bi valence was about 3.29 for all the samples while the Cu valence was varied between 2.04 and 2.13. From the fact that the Cu valence 2.13 is equal to that of a 60-K-class YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.76} superconductor, we think that the Cu valence 2.13 is large enough to induce superconductivity and that optimization of the Cu valence for occurrence of

Figure 4: An XRD pattern of (Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} . The dotted and solid lines represent an observed pattern and that refined by Rietveld analysis, respectively. A pattern at the bottom is difference between the observed and refined intensities.

 superconductivity is achieved for this sample. In Fig. 7, the dependence of resistivity on temperature is shown. An increase in the oxygen content y from 6.77 to 6.88 led to a drastic decrease in resistivity from 2.06\times 10^{2} to 1.35\times 10^{-1}\Omega cm at 100 K. However, the sample, whose Cu valence was optimized to be 2.13, was not superconducting but still semiconducting.

According to the Hall effect measurement, the hole density of the oxygen-annealed sample was 3.6\times 10^{20} cm^{-3} at room temperature. This value is much smaller than 3.1\times 10^{21} cm^{-3} for a YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.76} sample.[10] In Fig. 8, the hole density n_{H} and the ratio of itinerant holes p/v are shown. With an increase in the Cu valence from 2.08 to 2.16, the hole density was increased from 1.0\times 10^{19} to 3.6\times 10^{20} cm^{-3}. These values of hole density measured by the Hall effect measurement are much smaller than those calculated by the Mott-Hubbard model assuming that an increase in the Cu valence from 2.0 to 3.0 dopes one hole to the Cu ion [represented by a broken line in Fig. 8(a)], resulting that the hole density measured by the Hall voltage measurement did not reach the hatched optimum hole density region, necessary for the occurrence of superconductivity. In spite of the optimization of the Cu valence for the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase, its hole density was extremely small in comparison with the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.76} superconductor. Therefore, it is revealed that holes induced by the excess oxygen are not doped to the CuO_{2} plane sufficiently. While the ratio of itinerant holes p/v in Bi-based superconductors was as large as 100-200 %,[20] the ratio of the N_{2}-, air-, and O_{2}-annealed (Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} specimens was 0.02, 3, and 14 %, respectively [Fig. 8(b)], indicating that the majority of holes are localized somewhere.

The first site where holes may be localized is apical oxygen. The distance between the apical oxygen and the CuO_{2} plane of the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase is about 2.28 A, which is 0.15 A shorter than that of the Bi-2212 phase. The extremely short Cu-O(apex) distance may localize holes at the apical

  oxygen and suppress its superconductivity. The second site is in the (Bi,Cu)O_{1+z} layer. We estimated the Cu valence to be 2.13. This is indeed the case if the Cu(1) and the Cu(2) valences are equal. If the valence of the Cu(1) atom in the (Bi,Cu)O_{1+z} plane is larger than the expected one, the hole density in the CuO_{2} plane will be smaller than the estimated value 2.13. Furthermore, the Bi valence in the (Bi,Cu)O_{1+z} layer of the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase is 3.29, which is relatively high compared with 3.03-3.17, those of the Bi-2212 superconductors,[11] suggesting that the holes may be localized in the (Bi,Cu)O_{1+z} layer. In order to elucidate where the holes are localized, electronic states of the CuO_{2} layer were calculated by a DV-X\alpha molecular orbital calculation method.

_Simulation of electronic structure of (Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} by the DV-X\alpha method._ We believe that the nonsuperconductivity of the (Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} is strongly correlated with the microstructure of the CuO_{2} layer. Consequently, the DV-X\alpha method was applied to a distorted pyramidal CuO_{5} cluster in the (Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y}. The structure of the CuO_{5} cluster is shown in Fig. 9. Three structural parameters used for the CuO_{5} cluster are the Cu-O(plane) length, the Cu-O(apex) length, and buckling. The symmetrized orbital of the C_{4}V group was used. By changing the total electron number in the CuO_{5} cluster, the hole density was controlled by changing the number of total electrons in the cluster. We used O_{1s}-O_{2p} and Cu_{1s}-Cu_{4p} orbitals as the ground state function.

In this case, only the pyramidal CuO_{5} cluster was considered for the calculation and no external electric field was considered. The electronic states of the CuO_{5} cluster in the Bi-2212 and Y-123 superconductors were compared with that of (Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y}. In particular, we focused our calculation on the localization of holes at apical oxygen. The structural parameters of the Bi-2212 and Y-123 superconductors were cited from Imai _et al._[12] and Izumi _et al._[13], respectively. In this calculation, 0.16 of holes were doped into the (Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67})Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y}, Bi-2212, and Y-123 phases. Thus, the calculation for (CuO_{3})^{-7.84} was carried out. All parameters of the CuO_{5} cluster used for DV-X\alpha calculation are listed in Table 3.

The molecular orbital energy levels near the Fermi level (E_{r}) calculated by the DV-X\alpha method are shown in Fig. 10. Here, the solid and dashed lines correspond to the occupied and the unoccupied orbitals, respectively. The notations at the right side such as 8A1, 4E, etc., denote the irreducible representation of the C4_v_ point group and the sequential number of each irreducible group. The molecular orbital with the same notation is connected by the dashed and dotted lines. First of all, we are aware that the change in the sequence of molecular orbitals for each model is small. This is because the electronic structure is not largely changed by the slight changes in geometry between the models for the (Bi, Cu)-1212, Bi-2201, and Y-123 systems. Especially, the hole doped level is the 5B1 state for all clusters, which are constituted by the hybridized Cu3d_{x2-y2} and O2p_{xy} orbitals of planar oxygens. Therefore, not only for the Bi-2212 and Y-123 superconductors but for the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase, a hole located in the CuO_{5} cluster is doped to the Cu-O(plane) orbital, resulting in holes that will be contributed to the electric conduction.

The hole distribution on each element was calculated from effective charges obtained by a Mulliken population analysis.[9] Here, the hole number is defined by the subtraction of the formal charge from the effective charge. The hole

  numbers thus obtained are listed in Table 4. The doped holes were mainly distributed to the O(plane) while a few holes were distributed to the O(apex) and Cu(plane). However, a slight difference exists in the hole distribution to the O(apex). About 10% of the doped hole is distributed to the O(apex) site for the (Bi,Cu)-1212 and Bi-2212 phases, while about 20% of the doped holes are distributed to that for the Y-123 phase. In order to make clear the cause for the hole distribution to the O(apex) of the Y-123 to be twice as large as that for (Bi,Cu)-1212 or Bi-2212, the parameters of the Cu-O(plane) length, Cu-O(apex) length, and buckling were varied independently. As a result, a decrease in the Cu-O(apex) length was found to be the most effective for an increase in the hole at the O(apex) site. Increasing both the Cu-O(plane) length and buckling of the O-Cu-O(plane) were less effective for the increase in the hole at the O(apex) site.

From the DV-\chi\alpha calculation, it is found that if a hole is doped to the CuO_{5} cluster, the holes will be located at the Cu-O(plane) orbital, resulting in the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase showing a metallic property. Considering that the hole density measured by the Hall effect is much smaller than that calculated by the Mott-Hubbard model as described above, it is suggested that a hole is not doped to the CuO_{5} cluster but localized in the (Bi,Cu)O, block layer. Thus, the origin of nonsuperconductivity of (Bi,Cu)-1212 is found to be localization of holes in the block layer. It is promising to substitute the blocking layer for another element to inhibit the localization of holes in the (Bi,Cu)O_{2} block layer.

**B. [M_{{\bf 0},{\bf 3}}Cu_{{\bf 0},{\bf 6}}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y}**

As described above, it was found that [Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} does not exhibit superconductivity because of the localization of holes in the block layer. So, we tried to make the [Bi_{0.33}Cu_{0.67}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} superconducting by substitution of Bi for the other elements. We examined various metal elements for the substitution of Bi. We referred to the compounds of (_M_{x}_Cu_{1-x}_)Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} (Refs. [14 and 15]) to choose the most promising element (_M_ = Li, Co, Ni, Zn, Ph, Al, Ga, In, As, Cr, Fe, Ge, Sn, Se, Ti, Zr, Ru, Pt, V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, Re, and Os).

When the element, M was Co, Al, Ga, Fe, Ti, Cr, Ge, V, Mo, W, and Re, a single phase of 1212 phase was formed. Among these single-phase compounds, that with M = Mo exhibited superconductivity above 30 K as shown in Fig. 11.

**C. [(Bi_{1-x}Mo_{x})_{{\bf 0},{\bf 3}}Cu_{{\bf 0},{\bf 6}}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y}**

From the result of Sec. IV.2, a solid solution between the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase and the (Mo,Cu)-1212 phase appears to be suitable for inducing superconductivity. Therefore, we ex

  amined a range of the solid solution represented by x in [(Bi_{1-x}Mo_{x})_{0.33}Cu_{0.67}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y}. Figure 12 shows the XRD patterns for (Bi,Mo,Cu)-1212 samples prepared under various Bi/Mo ratios (0 <= x <= 1.0). In the range 0 <= x <= 1.0, no peaks attributable to impurity were observed, indicating that a single phase of the (Bi,Mo,Cu)-1212 was prepared in a whole range between (Bi0,33Cu0.67)-1212 and (Mo0.33Cu0.67)-1212.

For the (Bi,Mo,Cu)-1212 phases, dependence of resistivity on temperature is shown in Fig. 13(a). The resistivity of a Mo-free (_x_ = 0) sample was so large that its resistivity was plotted with a scale of 0.1. The substitution of Mo for Bi led to a drastic decrease in resistivity. Finally, when x went up to over 0.55, a superconducting transition was observed. In Fig. 13(b), dependence of magnetic susceptibility on temperature is shown, revealing that bulk superconductivity is observed for samples with x = 0.8 and 1.0.

In order to estimate the volume fraction of the Meissner effect of the [(Bi_{1-x}Mo_{x})_{0.33}Cu_{0.67}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} (_x_ = 0) superconductor, we compared that with that of the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} superconductor. While the drop of the output by the Meissner effect of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} was - 6.0x10^{-3} V/g at 22 K, that of [(Bi_{1-x}Mo_{x})_{0.33}Cu_{0.67}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} (_x_ = 0) was - 2.0 x10^{-3} V/g at 22 K, indicating that the volume fraction of the Meissner effect of [(Bi_{1-x}Mo_{x})_{0.33}Cu_{0.67}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} (_x_ = 0) was as large as one-third of that of the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} at 22 K. Even if the volume fraction of the Meissner effect of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} is as low as 30% at 22 K, which is considered to be the lowest estimation for the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} superconductor, that of the [(Bi_{1-x}Mo_{x})_{0.33}Cu_{0.67}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} (_x_ = 0) is estimated to be larger than 10%. Therefore, the [(Bi_{1-x}Mo_{x})_{0.33}Cu_{0.67}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} is found to be a bulk superconductor.

A correlation between the substitution ratio x and transition temperature (T_{c}^{\rm on}) is shown in Fig. 14. Superconductivity

  ity is observed for the sample with 0.55 <= x <= 1.0. In particular, for the samples with x = 0.55 - 1.0, the maximum _T_cen above 30 K was attained.

In order to clarify whether or not the Mo substitution delocalizes holes in the block layer, oxygen contents and Cu valences of the [(Bi1-Mo)0.33Cu0.67]Sr2YCu2Oy samples were measured. As shown in Fig. 15, the oxygen content y was increased with an increase in x, although there was a slight drop for the sample with x = 0.6. On the other hand, the Cu valence once increased with an increase in x from 0 to 0.2 in the [(Bi1-_x_Mo)0.33Cu0.67]Sr2YCu2Oy. However, a further increase in x above 0.2 led to a decrease in the Cu valence. Here, the valences of Bi and Mo are assumed to be Bi(III) and Mo(VI), respectively. In Fig. 16, the values of _T_cen were plotted against the Cu valence, showing that the maximum _T_cen of 37 K is obtained for the sample with a Cu valence of 2.19. Since the whole curve appears to be bell shaped as was frequently observed in high-_T_cen superconductors,6,16-18 the samples, whose Cu valence is over 2.21, should be overdoped and metallic. Nevertheless, the electronic property of such samples was not metallic but semiconducting, suggesting that the samples are in the underdoped region. Therefore, it is difficult to explain the change in _T_c simply by a change in the Cu valence.

We measured hole density (_nH_) at room temperature from the Hall coefficient. As shown in Fig. 17, with an increase in Mo substitution, x led to an increase in the hole density (_nH_). Superconductivity occurs when _nH_ exceeds 1.0 x 1021/cm3. Based on the Mott-Hubbard theory, it has been believed that an increase in the hole density leads to an increase in the Cu valence. For the [(Bi1-_x_Mo)0.33Cu0.67]Sr2YCu2Oy phase, however, the increase in the hole density led to a decrease in the Cu valence, indicating that a Cu valence is not an appropriate barometer for estimating its hole density.

For the purpose of investigating the cause of the behavior against the Mott-Hubbard theory, Rietveld analysis8 was carried out for all the (Bi,Mo,Cu)-1212 samples. For example, a

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} Atom & Site & x & y & z & Occupancy & B [Å2] \\ Bi & 1a & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.1485 & 0.5 \\ Mo & 1a & 0 & 0 & 0.1815 & 0.5 \\ Cu(1) & 1a & 0 & 0 & 0.67 & 0.5 \\ Sr & 2h & 1/2 & 1/2 & 0.1972 & 1 & 0.5 \\ Y & 1d & 1/2 & 1/2 & 1/2 & 1 & 0.2 \\ Cu(2) & 2g & 0 & 0 & 0.355(4) & 1 & 0.5 \\ O(1) & 4i & 0 & 1/2 & 0.375(2) & 0.98 & 0.5 \\ O(2) & 2g & 0 & 0 & 0.169(8) & 0.90 & 1.5 \\ O(3) & 1c & 1/2 & 1/2 & 0 & 0.41 & 1.5 \\ O(4) & 2f & 0 & 1/2 & 0  result of the analysis for the x\!=\!0.55 sample is displayed in Fig. 18 and Table 5. In Fig. 18, the dotted and solid lines represent the observed and calculated XRD patterns, respectively. The pattern at the bottom of the figure shows the difference between the observed and calculated intensities at the same diffraction angle. Table 5 shows crystallographic data for this sample. Since the reliability factor for the analysis was R_{wp}\!=\!6.81\%, the proposed model appears to be an appropriate one. Its structure is composed of layers with (Bi,Mo,Cu)O_{1+z}, SrO, CuO_{2}, and Y. It is isostructural with that of the (Bi,Cu)-1212 phase (Fig. 5) except the partial substitution of Mo for Bi,Cu(1) site. From the structure refined by the Rietveld analysis, the lattice parameters of this system were plotted against the component ratio x (Fig. 19). While an a-axis length of the (Bi, Mo, Cu)-1212 phase was slightly increased with an increase in x, its c-axis length was decreased. However, any anomalous change in the a- and c-axis length at a value around 0.55 was not observed. On the other hand, it was found that occupancy of the oxygen sites in the block layer was remarkably changed with varying the x value. As shown in Fig. 5, there are two sorts of oxygen sites in the block layer. One is the O(3) site located in the facial center, and the other is the O(4) site located on the line between the {Bi,Mo,Cu(1)} sites. In Fig. 20, oxygen occupancies of the O(3) and O(4) sites against x in [(Bi_{1-x}Mo_{x})_{0.33}Cu_{0.67}]Sr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y} was displayed. It is difficult to determine the oxygen site occupancy exactly from Rietveld analysis using x-ray diffraction data. However, the standard deviations of the oxygen occupancy were smaller than 10%, indicating that a systematic change in the occupancy with varying x was found. While occupancy of the O(3) site decreases with an increase in x, that of the O(4) site increases. Since the superconductivity is observed for the samples with 0.55\leqx\!\leq\!1.0, the oxygen in the O(4) site with the occupancy over 0.5 may be crucial for appearance of superconductivity. Further it was found that the distance between the apical oxygen and the Cu(2) was remarkably changed. The distance between the apical oxygen O(2) and

  Cu(2) as a function of x is displayed in Fig. 21. While the O(2)-Cu(2) distance was decreased from 2.30 to 2.15 A with an increase in x from 0 to 0.55, it was increased from 2.15 to 2.21 A with a further increase in x from 0.55 to 1.0. Considering that superconductivity appears in the region of x >= 0.55, where the Cu(2)-O(2) distance increases with the increase in x, the distance between Cu(plane) and O(apex) may be correlated with the occurrence of superconductivity.

In order to elucidate correlation between the electronic structure of the block layer and the change in the structure of the block layer, a bond valence sum (BVS) calculation was carried out.19 In Fig. 22, the BVS of mixed (Bi,Mo,Cu) valence is plotted against the x in \left\{\left. \text{(Bi}_{1-x}\text{Mo}_{x}\right)_{0.35}\text{Cu}_{0.67}\right\}\text{Sr}_{2}\text{YCu}_{2}\text{O}_{y}\right., clearly indicating that the BVS is drastically decreased with an increase in x. It is quite different from the formal valence drawn on the assumption that Cu, Bi, and Mo are 2+, 3+, and 6+, respectively. It is found that superconductivity occurs in the x region where the BVS is smaller than the formal valence, suggesting that Mo substitution for Bi moves localized holes to the CuO2 layer in connection with changes in the occupancies of O(3) and O(4) in the block layer. It seems that our results are consistent with the band calculation data saying that a chemical state of the Bi is strongly affected by the structure in the block layer.20,21 We believe that this is the origin of superconductivity for the (Bi,Mo,Cu)-1212 phase.

### Nonsuperconducting cuprates

Various nonsuperconducting cuprates with a Cu valence over 2.1 are listed in Table 6. We have already clarified that nonsuperconductivity of BaLaRuCuO5.13,22 (Bi0.33Cu0.67)Sr_{2}YCu2O6.79, and Eu1.3Ba1.5Cu3O7 (Ref. 23) comes from localization of holes and that the localization of holes is originated from the absence and CuO2 sheet, the high BVS of the (Bi0.33Cu0.67) site and Cu(1) site, respectively. Further, nonsuperconductivity of PrBa2Cu3O7 is believed to come from hybridization of the Pr4_if_ and O2_p_p_ orbitals.24 Since these cuprates except BaLaRuCuO5.13 have CuO2 sheets in structure, if the trapped holes are delocalized, the cuprates will become metallic and probably superconducting.

It is well known that the treatment under high pressure oxygen has an effect on doping holes to the cuprates. By the treatment, many cuprates such as a (La,Sr)2CaCu2Oy and (Cu,C)Ba2CaCu2Oy induced superconductivity. We would like to emphasize that substitution of an element in the block layer also takes effect on a occurrence of superconductivity as well as the high pressure oxygen treatment. The (Bi,Mo, Cu)-1212 phase is one of the cases.

On the other hand, La4BaCu5O13 and La5SrCu6O15 cuprates are metallic by themselves, indicating almost all holes are originally delocalized. Accordingly, the cause of nonsuperconductivity of these cuprates are considered to be their three-dimensional Cu-O network, suggesting that the CuO2 sheets are essential to the occurrence of superconductivity. At this stage, we are not sure how to make these metallic cuprates superconducting.

## IV Conclusion

A single phase of the (Bi,Cu)-1212 was successfully prepared. Two indispensable keys to prepare a single phase of (Bi,Cu)-1212 were to quench the sample after sintering, and to control x in a very narrow region around x = 0.67 in the (Bi1-_x_Cu,x)Sr2YCu2Oy.

From a Rietveld analysis, it was confirmed that the compound has a double CuO2 plane. Annealing the sample in an atmosphere of oxygen led to an increase in the Cu valence as large as 2.13. However, the sample was not superconducting but semiconducting.

By combined experiments of a hole density measurement and a DV-_X__a_ calculation, it was revealed that holes for the achievement of superconductivity were not doped to the CuO2 plane sufficiently but were localized in the (Bi,Cu)O1++, plane. In order to make the (Bi,Cu)-1212 superconducting (Bi,Mo,Cu)-1212 solid solution was prepared for 0<_x_<1.0 in \left[ \left( \text{Bi}_{1-x}\text{Mo}_{x}\right)_{0.35}\text{Cu}_{0.67}\right]Sr2YCu2Oy. The samples in the region of 0.55<_x_<1.0 showed superconductivity. However, the appearance of superconductivity cannot be explained only by a change in the Cu valence. Instead, it was found that the bond valence sum of the block layer was drastically changed with changes in occupancies of the oxygen sites O(3) and O(4) and the Cu(2)-O(2) distance, which may be the origin of superconductivity.
