###### Abstract

A high quality superconducting Li0.68NbO2 polycrystalline sample was prepared by deintercalation of Li ions from Li0.93NbO2. The field-dependent resistivity and specific heat were measured down to 0.5 K. The temperature dependence of the upper critical field is determined. A notable specific-heat jump is observed at the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\)\(\sim\) 5.0 K at zero field. Below \(T_{c}\), the electronic specific heat shows a thermal activated behavior and agrees well with the theoretical result for the BCS _s_-wave superconductor. It indicates that the superconducting pairing in Li0.68NbO2 has _s_-wave symmetry.

2006 10.1103/PhysRevB.74.012504 2006 10.1103/PhysRevB.74.012504 2006 10.1103/PhysRevB.74.012504 2006  by firing a mixture of Nb\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{5}\) and metallic Nb in a molar ratio of 1:3 in an evacuated fused-silica tube at 1100 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 72 h. The lithium content was determined by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy. The as-prepared sample was slightly nonstoichiometric in lithium due to its volatility, Li\({}_{0.93}\)NbO\({}_{2}\), which is very close to the values previously reported.[2; 11; 12] Li\({}_{0.68}\)NbO\({}_{2}\) was prepared from Li\({}_{0.93}\)NbO\({}_{2}\) by chemical treatments at room temperature using bromine or hydrochloric acid as an oxidative reagent. After the treatment, the sample changed from reddish to black, indicating that the electronic properties were modified. The powder x-ray-diffraction pattern showed that both the as-prepared and dient intercalated samples are single phased with no trace of LiNbO\({}_{3}\) and Nb.

The low-temperature resistivity was determined by the standard four-point measurement with a Quantum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS). In the measurement, an alternating current of 200 \(\mu\)A, corresponding to a current density of about 5.33 mA/cm\({}^{2}\), was applied. The temperature dependence of the resistivity does not change by varying the measurement current from 100 to 500 \(\mu\)A. The low-temperature specific-heat measurements in the range from 0.5 to 7 K were performed with a \({}^{3}\)He heat-pulsed thermal relaxation calorimeter attached to the PPMS up to 3 T. The precision of the measurement is about 1%. The field dependence of thermometer and addenda was carefully calibrated before the specific heat was measured.

Figure 2 shows the temperature and field dependence of the resistivity for Li\({}_{0.68}\)NbO\({}_{2}\). At zero field, the onset temperature of superconductivity is 5.5 K, and the resistivity becomes zero at about 4.8 K. The transition width is about 0.7 K. With increasing fields, the transition width is heavily broadened, similar as in high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors.[13; 14; 15; 16] This broadening may result from the anisotropy of the upper critical field \(H_{c2}\), arising from the two dimensionality of the material. Our polycrystalline sample consists of many randomly oriented crystallites. For each crystallite, \(H_{c2}\) takes its maximum when the applied field \(H\) is perpendicular to the \(c\) axis (\(H\bot c\)), and a minimum when \(H\|c\). Thus the superconducting transition is broadened notably under an applied magnetic field since the superconductivity with minimal \(H_{c2}\) is first destroyed. The inhomogeneous distribution of charge carriers may also lead to the broadening of the transition width.

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of the upper critical field \(H_{c2}(T)\) determined from the resistivity and specific-heat curves. The data denoted by \(T_{0}\), \(T_{50}\), \(T_{90}\), and \(T_{c}\) (onset) represent the temperatures at which the resistivity equal to 0%, 50%, 90%, 100% of the normal-state resistivity, respectively. \(T_{s}\) is determined from the midpoint of the superconducting transition in the specific-heat curve and the error bar shows the one-half of transition width. The inset of Fig. 4 shows how \(T_{s}\) and the error bar are determined from the specific-heat data for \(H\)=0.1 T. The specific-heat jump is strongly suppressed at high field, thus only low-field \(T_{s}\) can be reliably determined. \(H_{c2}(T)\) determined from the 90% normal-state resistivity agrees very well with that from the specific-heat measurement. Near \(T_{c}\), \(H_{c2}\) shows a positive curvature. Similar positive curvature in \(H_{c2}(T)\) was observed

  in high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates.[17, 18] It may result from the fluctuation of the order parameter and the inhomogeneous distribution of charge carriers.

The specific-heat measurement is a powerful tool for investigating the low-lying superconducting quasiparticles. It probes bulk properties and can be used to determine the pairing symmetry of superconductors.[19, 20, 21, 22, 23] Figure 4 shows the measurement data of the specific heat for Li\({}_{0.68}\)NbO\({}_{2}\). A clear anomaly associated with the superconducting transition is discerned at about \(T\)\(\sim\) 5 K at zero field. This anomaly persists with \(H\) up to 3 T. There is no upturn in all the curves of \(C/T\) down to 0.5 K. This suggests that the sample is free of magnetic impurities.

The measured specific heat \(C\) contains the contribution from both electrons and phonons, \(C\)=\(C_{el}\)+\(C_{ph}\). At low temperatures, the phonon contribution to the specific heat \(C_{ph}\) does not depend on the applied magnetic field and follows the Debye law, i.e., \(C_{ph}\)\(\sim\) \(T^{3}\), in both the normal and superconducting states. In the normal state, the electronic contribution to the specific heat \(C_{el}\) varies linearly with \(T\), thus the total specific heat can be expressed as

\[C_{n}(T)=\gamma_{n}T+\alpha T^{3},\] (1)

where \(\gamma_{n}\) and \(\alpha\) are temperature-independent coefficients. By fitting the normal-state data with this formula, we find that \(\gamma_{n}\)= 3.588\(\pm\)0.038 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) and \(\alpha\)=0.07258 \(\pm\)0.000 75 mJ/mol K\({}^{4}\). This \(\gamma_{n}\) value is smaller than the corresponding value for Li\({}_{x}\)NbS\({}_{2}\) (\(\sim\) 10 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\)),[24] NaCoO\({}_{2}\) (\(\sim\)24 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\)),[25, 26] LiTi\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{4}\) (\(\sim\) 19.15 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\)),[27] and Sr\({}_{2}\)RuO\({}_{4}\) (\(\sim\)40 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\)).[28] The Debye temperature deduced from \(\alpha\) is 462\(\pm\)12 K.

The normal-state electronic specific-heat coefficient \(\gamma_{n}\) is proportional to the density of states of electrons at the Fermi level \(N(E_{F})\). In the free-electron model, it can be written as

\[\gamma_{n}=\frac{\pi^{2}}{3}k_{B}^{2}N(E_{F}).\] (2)

Novikov _et al._ calculated the band structure of Li\({}_{0.5}\)NbO\({}_{2}\) using the full potential linear muffin-tin orbital (FLMTO) method.[8] They found that the density of states \(N(E_{F})\) at Fermi level is 6.02 l/eV. If we take this value for Li\({}_{0.68}\)NbO\({}_{2}\), the value of calculated \(\gamma_{n}\)\(\sim\) 3.85 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) is close to 3.58 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\), the value obtained from the specific-heat measurement. This signifies that the electron-phonon coupling is very weak in this material.

In the superconducting state, the electronic specific heat can be obtained by subtracting the phonon term from the total specific heat \(C_{el}\)=\(C-C_{ph}\). As shown in Fig. 5(a), \(C_{el}\)/\(T\) drops with decreasing temperature. In the absence of magnetic field, \(C/T\) extrapolates to a small but finite value \(\gamma_{s}\) =0.195 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) at zero temperature. This residual specific heat indicates that there is a residual density of states at the Fermi level, which in turn means that the superconducting volume fraction of the sample is less than 100%. From the ratio \((\gamma_{n}-\gamma_{s})/\gamma_{m}\) we estimate the superconducting volume fraction of the sample to be 94.5%. This value of the superconducting volume fraction is rather high compared with the previous reports.[2, 29] It is presumably due to the improved treatment of the sample quality.

Figure 5(a) compares the measurement data with the BCS mean-field results of \(s\)- and \(d\)-wave superconductors. Apparently, the \(d\)-wave result deviate significantly from the experimental data in the whole temperature range. However, the \(s\)-wave result fits extremely well with the experimental data, especially in the low-temperature regime. The jump of the specific heat at \(T_{c}\) is less than the theoretical value. This is probably due to the fact that the superconducting transition of this material happens in a finite temperature range (0.7 K) rather than just at one point as in the BCS theory. By plotting \(C_{el}\) as a function of \(T_{c}\)/\(T\) in a semilogarithmic scale [Fig. 5(b)], we find that \(C_{el}\) indeed decreases exponentially with \(T\) at low temperatures. By further fitting the low-temperature data with the following formula:[30]

\[C_{el}\approx 2\sqrt{2\pi}k_{B}N(E_{F})\Delta(0)\bigg{(}\frac{\Delta(0)}{k_{B}T} \bigg{)}^{3/2}e^{-\Delta(0)/k_{B}T},\] (3)

we find that \(\Delta(0)\)\(\approx\) 0.8 meV. This value of \(\Delta(0)\) is close to that determined simply from \(T_{c}\) using the weak-coupling BCS formula \(\Delta(0)\)=1.76\(k_{B}T_{c}\)=0.76 meV.

In conclusion, we have measured the field and temperature dependence of resistivity and specific heat of

  Li\({}_{0.68}\)NbO\({}_{2}\). The upper critical field is extracted from both the resistivity and the specific-heat curves. A notable specific-heat jump is observed at \(T_{c}\)\(\sim\) 5.0 K at zero field and suppressed by the applied field. By subtracting the phonon contribution, the electronic specific heat \(C_{el}\) is obtained from the measured data. The linear coefficient of \(C_{el}\) is found to be \(\gamma_{n}\)\(=\) 3.588 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) and the Debye temperature is \(\Theta_{D}\) =462 K. Below \(T_{c}\), \(C_{el}\) shows a thermal activated behavior and the temperature dependence of \(C_{el}\) agrees well with the BCS result for a \(s\)-wave superconductor.
