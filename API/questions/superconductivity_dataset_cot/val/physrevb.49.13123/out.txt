###### Abstract

It is known that superconductivity in TlSrLaCuO_{5} is due to the overlap of empty Tl 6s band with the antibonding Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 band at the Fermi level. This motivated us to investigate the effects of isovalent-cation substitution in superconducting TlSrLaCuO_{5} and semiconducting TlBaLaCuO_{5}. We have succeeded in inducing superconductivity in TlBaLaCuO_{5} by introducing Ca^{2+} at the Ba sites.

## I Introduction

Holes in single Tl-O layered compounds Tl_A_2Ca_n_-Cu_n_O_2n_+3 (where A = Ba or Sr and n = 1 - 5) and double Tl-O layered compounds Tl_Ba_2Ca_n_-Cu_n_O_2n_+4 (where n = 1 - 4) are created via two different mechanisms.[1, 2] In the former class, itinerant charge carriers are created either by introducing higher-valence cations[2]2-4 in place of lower-valence cations or by creating anion nonstoichiometry.[5] In the latter class, holes are largely created by the preexisting _redox mechanism_,[6] i.e., due to the overlap of the empty Tl 6s band with the antibonding Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 band [see Fig. 1(a)], electrons are transferred from CuO_{2} planes to Tl-O layers and vice versa: Tl^{3+}+Cu^{2+}\simeqT[13]+Cu^{2+6)+}^{+}. Recently, it has been proposed that the redox mechanism is responsible for hole generation in a derivative of the single Tl-O layered compound with n = 1, TlSrLaCuO_{5} (_T_e = 32 K). This conclusion follows from tight-binding electronic band-structure calculations[8] and has been established experimentally by x-ray-photoelectron spectroscopic studies on TlBa_{1-x}Sr_{x}LaCuO_{5}.[9] It should be pointed out that the isostructural compound TlBaLaCuO_{5} is not a superconductor, in fact it is a semiconductor.[3] In this case, the Fermi level lies below the bottom of the Tl 6s band, as shown in Fig. 1(b), rendering the redox mechanism non-operative.[10]

In order to make the redox mechanism in TlBaLaCuO_{5} operative, the lower Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 Hubbard band must be raised (in energy) so as to overlap with the empty Tl 6s band. This is possible if one is able to decrease the in-plane Cu-O bond length. As the Cu-O bond length decreases, the Fermi level rises and moves toward the empty Tl 6s band. Eventually, the Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 band overlaps with the Tl 6s band [see Fig. 1(c)]. This causes electrons to flow from Cu ions to Tl ions and holes are introduced in the Cu band.

Experimentally, a decrease of the Cu-O bond length may be accomplished by substituting the bigger Ba^{2+} ions in TlBaLaCuO_{5} with smaller isovalent cations,[9, 11] for example, Sr^{2+}. Both the lattice parameters a and c of the tetragonal structure of the system TlBa_{1-x}Sr_{x}LaCuO_{5} decrease as a function of x. The decrease in a implies a decrease of the in-plane Cu-O bond length because it has been observed that in all thalliium-based high-_T_c superconductors the in-plane Cu-O bond length is one-half of a. The concentration of holes may be increased by increasing x in TlBa_{1-x}Sr_{x}LaCuO_{5}. As a

  result, T_{c} also increases. Interestingly, the maximum T_{c} is observed in TlSrLaCuO_{5} (32-46 K depending upon the preparative conditions [9, 12, 13]). One may expect that the hole concentration in TlSrLaCuO_{5} may increase (leading to overdoping of holes) if the degree of overlap is further increased by substituting Sr^{2+} ions by still smaller iso-valent cations (Ca^{2+}). This should induce a variation of T_{c} (T_{c} should further increase, or if the compound is already optimally hole doped T_{c} should decrease due to overdoping) in the system TlSr_{1-y}Ca_{y}LaCuO_{5} in a manner similar to that in other high-T_{c} superconductors, such as La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}.[14] These considerations led us to examine the effect of hole doping in TlBaLaCuO_{5} by introducing the smaller Ca^{2+} ions. We have, in fact, succeeded in inducing superconductivity in this material following this approach. In this paper, we report the results of these investigations.

## II Experimental

Samples of the type TlSr_{1-y}Ca_{y}LaCuO_{5} (0 \leq y \leq 1.0) and TlBa_{1-z}Ca_{x}LaCuO_{5} (0 \leq z \leq 1.0) were prepared by the method followed in our preparation of the materials TlBa_{1-x}Sr_{x}LaCuO_{5}.[9] The phase purity of the samples was checked by x-ray powder diffraction. The superconducting properties were examined by the ac mutual inductance (frequency = 313 Hz) technique and four-probe resistance measurements. In order to check reproducibility of the results, three independent batches of the above-mentioned samples were made and investigated.

## III Results

X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) showed that essentially single-phase samples of the composition TlSr_{1-y}Ca_{y}LaCuO_{5} are formed for 0.0 \leq y \leq 0.6 and of the composition TlBa_{1-z}Ca_{x}LaCuO_{5} for 0.0 \leq z \leq 0.8. The powder-diffraction pattern of TlBa_{1-z}Ca_{x}LaCuO_{5} (_z_ = 0.0-0.8) is shown in Fig. 2. Traces of some impurity phases in materials of both systems were seen. Diffraction lines could be indexed on the basis of the 1:2:0:1 phase, with the space group P4/_mmm_. Lattice parameters a and c, obtained using a least-squares fitting procedure, are given in Table 1. ac susceptibility measurements of two samples of the system TlSr_{1-y}Ca_{y}LaCuO_{5}, namely, those corresponding to y = 0.3 and 0.6, showed that the superconducting onset temperature, respectively, is 32 and 26 K. Figure 3 shows the normalized resistance of these samples as a function of temperature, T_{c0} for the two samples are 30 and 20 K, respectively.

Superconductivity was observed in the system TlBa_{1-x}Ca_{x}LaCuO_{5} with 12 < _T_{c} < 16 K for 0.3 \leq z \leq 0.8. Figure 4 shows the resistance of the material TlBa_{0.4}Ca_{0.6}LaCuO_{5} as a function of temperature; T_{c0}=13 K. The inset of Fig. 4 shows the diamagnetic response of this material as a function of temperature, with onset temperature \sim 16 K. In view of the fact that the effect of Ca doping in TlBaLaCuO_{5} is of particular interest, we synthesized two independent samples of TlBa_{0.4}Ca_{0.6}LaCuO_{5} and both the samples gave similar results. The strength of the ac \chi signal at the lowest temperature of our measurements (4.2 K) suggests clearly the TlBa_{0.4}Ca_{0.6}LaCuO_{5} is a bulk superconductor (the superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be in excess of 60%).

## IV Discussion

### Structural stability and role of thallium

Careful analysis of _x_-ray powder-diffraction patterns revealed the presence of a trace of La2CuO4 as impurity phase in the materials TlSr1-_y_Ca_y_LaCuO5 and TlBa1-_z_Ca_z_LaCuO5. The intensity of the impurity lines increases with increasing y in TlSr1-_y_Ca_y_LaCuO5. In the system TlBa1-_z_Ca_y_LaCuO5 the impurity phase appears with z = 0.8, as shown in Fig. 2. The stability of the tetragonal 1:2:0:1 phase of these systems could be understood in terms of a geometrical factor, the so-called tolerance factor, as discussed below.

All the known copper oxide superconductors are built up of oxygen-deficient perovskite layers intergrown with rocksalt or fluorite-type layers. In general, perovskite layers are made up of copper and oxygen, and, particularly in thallium compounds, the rocksalt or fluorite-type layers are Tl, Ba or Sr, Ca or rare earths, and oxygen. Stabilization of the intergrowth structure requires bond-length matching across the intergrowth interface. A measure of bond-length matching across the interface is the tolerance factor,[15]t = r_{A \cdot O}/\sqrt{2}r_{_{\rm CuO}}, where A represents the ions in the rocksalt or fluorite-type layers and _rA \cdot O_ is the average length of the _A_-O bonds in the structure. An ideal matching occurs when t = 1. t < 1 means that the CuO2 planes are under compression and the _A_-O layers are under tension.[16] The empirically observed limits for the stability of the intergrowth structure are 0.86 <= t <= 1.02.[17]

The tolerance factor for TlBa1-_x_Sr_LaCuO5 (0 <= x <= 1), TlSr1-_y_Ca_y_LaCuO5 (0 <= y <= 0.6), and TlBa1-_z_Ca_LaCuO5 (0 <= z <= 0.8) has been calculated according to the above relation using the average radii of the A ions, taken from Ref. [18], for the appropriate coordination number. Values of t for various materials are shown in Table 1.

The tolerance factor for the semiconducting TlBaLaCuO5 is 0.860, which lies right at the lower limit for the stability of the intergrowth structure. Upon substituting Sr at the Ba site, and considering that Tl remains in the 3+ state (so that its effective radius does not vary as a function of doping), the tolerance factor decreases below the lower limit (see Table 1), due to the smaller ionic radius of Sr, which means that the structure should not form. The fact that the structure forms (and therefore the tolerance factor must be within the stability limits), and the phase is stabilized, however, suggests that the valence of the Tl ions does change; it moves toward 1+ and the ions expand in size (radius = 0.885 A for Tl3+ and 1.50 A for Tl+ for six coordination). These studies, therefore, clearly throw light on the dual role of thallium in these materials, i.e., it stabilizes the structure by varying its size and allows the generation of holes, via the redox mechanism, by changing its valence. Of course, at the same time, the decrease in _r_CuO (see below) due to the creation of holes in the CuO2 planes also contributes to the increase in the effective value of the tolerance factor.

The solubility of Ca is limited by the tolerance factor t = 0.834, which is the limiting value for Ca in TlSr1-_y_Ca_y_LaCuO5 and TlBa1-_z_Ca_z_LaCuO5. Beyond the value of t = 0.834 the impurity phase dominates. Large concentrations of such ions correspond to a large fraction of monovalent Tl, which the lattice finds too difficult to accommodate because of its bigger ionic radius (1.50 A).

### Overdoping in TlSr1-_y_Ca_y_LaCuO5

The lattice parameters a and c decrease with increasing y (see Table 1). Decrease of c with increase of y implies that the Ca2+ ions substitute essentially for Sr2+ ions. Decrease of lattice parameter a with increase of y shows that the in-plane Cu-O bond length _r_CuO decreases, which should increase the overlap of the Tl 6s and Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 bands and thereby increase the hole concentra

 tion. The decrease of T_{c} for y=0.6 reveals that the material is in the overdoped state. The variation of T_{c} with hole concentration in the systems TlBa_{1-x}Sr_{x}LaCuO_{5} and TlSr_{1-y}Ca_{y}LaCuO_{5}, as a whole, is similar to what has been observed in the other high-T_{c} superconductors.

### Superconductivity in TlBa_{1-x}Ca_{x}LaCuO_{5}

In order to check the validity of the creation of the redox mechanism and thus the semiconductor-metal transition in TlBaLaCuO_{5} by substituting smaller alkaline rare earths (Sr^{2+}) at the Ba site and further Ca^{2+} at the Sr site in TlSrLaCuO_{5}, we have substituted Ca^{2+} at the Ba site in TlBaLaCuO_{5}. Decrease of the lattice parameters a and c with increase of z in TlBa_{1-z}Ca_{x}LaCuO_{5} suggests that the in-plane Cu-O bond length decreases, which should favor the overlap of Tl 6s and Cu 3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} bands at the Fermi level, and Ca essentially substitutes at the Ba site. The observation of superconductivity in TlBa_{1-z}Ca_{x}LaCuO_{5} for 0.3<z<0.8 proves the existence or creation of the redox mechanism when the lattice parameter a is small or made smaller. It is important to note that the compound TlCaLaCuO_{5} does not form, presumably again in accordance with the consideration of the tolerance factor. It is instructive to note that our attempt to prepare single-phase TlBaLaCuO_{5}, substituted with smaller rare earths at the bigger La site, which is also expected to decrease the in-plane Cu-O bond length and hence favor overlap of Tl 6s and Cu 3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} bands, was not successful. This may be due to the increase of the mismatch between Ba^{2+} and the smaller rare earths.

## V Conclusions

We have shown here that, using the concept of the _redox mechanism_, the hole concentration can be increased in TlSrLaCuO_{5} by substituting a smaller iso-valent cation (Ca^{2+}) at the bigger Sr site, leading to an overdoped region. Based on this model, we have also been able to induce superconductivity in the semiconducting TlBaLaCuO_{5} by substituting a smaller isovalent cation (Ca^{2+}) at the bigger Ba site. Structural-stability considerations give useful information with respect to the solubility limit of the substituent and the valence state of thallium.

## IV Discussion

### Structural stability and role of thallium

Careful analysis of _x_-ray powder-diffraction patterns revealed the presence of a trace of La2CuO4 as impurity phase in the materials TlSr1-_y_Ca_y_LaCuO5 and TlBa1-_z_Ca_z_LaCuO5. The intensity of the impurity lines increases with increasing y in TlSr1-_y_Ca_y_LaCuO5. In the system TlBa1-_z_Ca_y_LaCuO5 the impurity phase appears with z = 0.8, as shown in Fig. 2. The stability of the tetragonal 1:2:0:1 phase of these systems could be understood in terms of a geometrical factor, the so-called tolerance factor, as discussed below.

All the known copper oxide superconductors are built up of oxygen-deficient perovskite layers intergrown with rocksalt or fluorite-type layers. In general, perovskite layers are made up of copper and oxygen, and, particularly in thallium compounds, the rocksalt or fluorite-type layers are Tl, Ba or Sr, Ca or rare earths, and oxygen. Stabilization of the intergrowth structure requires bond-length matching across the intergrowth interface. A measure of bond-length matching across the interface is the tolerance factor,[15]t = r_{A \cdot O}/\sqrt{2}r_{_{\rm CuO}}, where A represents the ions in the rocksalt or fluorite-type layers and _rA \cdot O_ is the average length of the _A_-O bonds in the structure. An ideal matching occurs when t = 1. t < 1 means that the CuO2 planes are under compression and the _A_-O layers are under tension.[16] The empirically observed limits for the stability of the intergrowth structure are 0.86 <= t <= 1.02.[17]

The tolerance factor for TlBa1-_x_Sr_LaCuO5 (0 <= x <= 1), TlSr1-_y_Ca_y_LaCuO5 (0 <= y <= 0.6), and TlBa1-_z_Ca_LaCuO5 (0 <= z <= 0.8) has been calculated according to the above relation using the average radii of the A ions, taken from Ref. [18], for the appropriate coordination number. Values of t for various materials are shown in Table 1.

The tolerance factor for the semiconducting TlBaLaCuO5 is 0.860, which lies right at the lower limit for the stability of the intergrowth structure. Upon substituting Sr at the Ba site, and considering that Tl remains in the 3+ state (so that its effective radius does not vary as a function of doping), the tolerance factor decreases below the lower limit (see Table 1), due to the smaller ionic radius of Sr, which means that the structure should not form. The fact that the structure forms (and therefore the tolerance factor must be within the stability limits), and the phase is stabilized, however, suggests that the valence of the Tl ions does change; it moves toward 1+ and the ions expand in size (radius = 0.885 A for Tl3+ and 1.50 A for Tl+ for six coordination). These studies, therefore, clearly throw light on the dual role of thallium in these materials, i.e., it stabilizes the structure by varying its size and allows the generation of holes, via the redox mechanism, by changing its valence. Of course, at the same time, the decrease in _r_CuO (see below) due to the creation of holes in the CuO2 planes also contributes to the increase in the effective value of the tolerance factor.

The solubility of Ca is limited by the tolerance factor t = 0.834, which is the limiting value for Ca in TlSr1-_y_Ca_y_LaCuO5 and TlBa1-_z_Ca_z_LaCuO5. Beyond the value of t = 0.834 the impurity phase dominates. Large concentrations of such ions correspond to a large fraction of monovalent Tl, which the lattice finds too difficult to accommodate because of its bigger ionic radius (1.50 A).

### Overdoping in TlSr1-_y_Ca_y_LaCuO5

The lattice parameters a and c decrease with increasing y (see Table 1). Decrease of c with increase of y implies that the Ca2+ ions substitute essentially for Sr2+ ions. Decrease of lattice parameter a with increase of y shows that the in-plane Cu-O bond length _r_CuO decreases, which should increase the overlap of the Tl 6s and Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 bands and thereby increase the hole concentra

 tion. The decrease of T_{c} for y=0.6 reveals that the material is in the overdoped state. The variation of T_{c} with hole concentration in the systems TlBa_{1-x}Sr_{x}LaCuO_{5} and TlSr_{1-y}Ca_{y}LaCuO_{5}, as a whole, is similar to what has been observed in the other high-T_{c} superconductors.

### Superconductivity in TlBa_{1-x}Ca_{x}LaCuO_{5}

In order to check the validity of the creation of the redox mechanism and thus the semiconductor-metal transition in TlBaLaCuO_{5} by substituting smaller alkaline rare earths (Sr^{2+}) at the Ba site and further Ca^{2+} at the Sr site in TlSrLaCuO_{5}, we have substituted Ca^{2+} at the Ba site in TlBaLaCuO_{5}. Decrease of the lattice parameters a and c with increase of z in TlBa_{1-z}Ca_{x}LaCuO_{5} suggests that the in-plane Cu-O bond length decreases, which should favor the overlap of Tl 6s and Cu 3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} bands at the Fermi level, and Ca essentially substitutes at the Ba site. The observation of superconductivity in TlBa_{1-z}Ca_{x}LaCuO_{5} for 0.3<z<0.8 proves the existence or creation of the redox mechanism when the lattice parameter a is small or made smaller. It is important to note that the compound TlCaLaCuO_{5} does not form, presumably again in accordance with the consideration of the tolerance factor. It is instructive to note that our attempt to prepare single-phase TlBaLaCuO_{5}, substituted with smaller rare earths at the bigger La site, which is also expected to decrease the in-plane Cu-O bond length and hence favor overlap of Tl 6s and Cu 3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} bands, was not successful. This may be due to the increase of the mismatch between Ba^{2+} and the smaller rare earths.

## V Conclusions

We have shown here that, using the concept of the _redox mechanism_, the hole concentration can be increased in TlSrLaCuO_{5} by substituting a smaller iso-valent cation (Ca^{2+}) at the bigger Sr site, leading to an overdoped region. Based on this model, we have also been able to induce superconductivity in the semiconducting TlBaLaCuO_{5} by substituting a smaller isovalent cation (Ca^{2+}) at the bigger Ba site. Structural-stability considerations give useful information with respect to the solubility limit of the substituent and the valence state of thallium.
