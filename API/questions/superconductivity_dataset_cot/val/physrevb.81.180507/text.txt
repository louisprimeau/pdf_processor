20 March 20102  melting and the buttons were wrapped in Ta foil and annealed under vacuum at 500 degC for 2 weeks. X-ray diffraction measurements reveal the main phase is CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\), which crystallizes in the body-centered _14_/_mmm_ space group with lattice parameters \(a\) = 4.611(1) A and \(c\) = 21.647(3) A, consistent with a previous report.[16] Two samples were measured: sample A, in which extensive measurements of ac calorimetry were performed contained <2 vol % of Ce\({}_{3}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)In\({}_{13}\) impurities and sample B contained negligible amounts of Ce\({}_{3}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)In\({}_{13}\) and an unknown impurity phase. Specific heat, measured in a Quantum Design physical properties measurement system (PPMS) from 0.4 to 300 K, and electrical resistivity, performed via a standard four-wire measurement with Pt contacts, gave consistent results on both samples. ac-calorimetry measurements on sample A as a function of pressure were carried out as described in Ref. [12]. The electronic structure was calculated using the wien2k package[17] and with the experimental lattice parameters as input. This package is a full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method based on density-functional theory and uses the generalized gradient approximation for the exchange and correlation corrections. Nonoverlapping atomic-sphere radii of 2.5 (Ce), 2.5 (Rh), and 2.43 (In) atomic units were used for CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) while 2.5 (Ce), 2.5 (Co, Rh, Pd, Pt), and 2.39 (In) atomic units were used for Ce\(M_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\). The Ce 4\(f\) states were waves \(R_{MT}\)As\({}_{m}\)= 8 and the number of \(k\) points of 1152 for CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) and 1600 for Ce\(M_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\).

Figure (1a) shows that the structure of CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\) is comprised of a single CeIn\({}_{3}\) plane and two PtIn\({}_{2}\) layers stacked along the \(c\) axis of the tetragonal unit cell; this is a more two-dimensional variant of a new structure type in the Ce\({}_{m}\)\(M_{2}\)In\({}_{3m+2n}\) family. While the CeIn\({}_{3}\) block is similar to Ce\(M_{2}\)In\({}_{5}\), the Ce-Pt bond distance is much longer (\(R_{\rm Ce-Pt}\)= 4.98 A) in this body-centered CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\) structure than the Ce-\(M\) bond distance in the Ce\(M_{2}\)In\({}_{5}\) compounds (\(R_{\rm Ce-}M\) = 3.77 A) [Fig. 1(b)], which decreases the _f-d_ hybridization that has consequences for superconductivity as discussed below. The specific heat of CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\), plotted as \(C/T\) vs \(T\), is displayed in Fig. 1(c). The peak at \(T_{N}\)=5.5 K is indicative of a second-order transition to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. A fit of the data to \(C/T\)= \(\gamma\)= \(\beta\)T\({}^{2}\) between 12 \(<\)\(T\)\(<\) 19 K, yields \(\gamma\)=340 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) and \(\beta\) =2.88 mJ/mol K\({}^{4}\) (corresponding to a Debye temperature \(\theta_{D}\)=189 K). This Sommerfeld coefficient is similar to that of CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) (Ref. [12]) and implies a large effective mass enhancement in CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\). After subtraction of the \(\beta\)T\({}^{3}\) phonon term, the entropy amounts to \(S_{el}\)\(\sim\) 1/3\(R\) ln(2) at the Neel transition [Fig. 1(c) inset]. Further evidence for the antiferromagnetic transition is provided by susceptibility measurements (not shown) and a change in slope at 5.5 K of the electrical resistivity \(\rho\)(\(T\)) displayed in the inset of Fig. 1(c). A fit to the data for \(T\)\(<\)\(\pi\)\(T_{N}\) of \(\rho\)(\(T\))= \(\rho_{0}\)+\(A\)7\({}^{2}\) yields \(A\) =0.10 \(\mu\)D cm/K\({}^{2}\). Assuming the Kadowaki-Woods relation,[18] this value of \(A\) implies a Sommerfeld coefficient \(\gamma\)=100 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\), which is comparable to the extrapolated zero-temperature value of 50 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) in Fig. 1. This value of \(\gamma\) in the ordered state is about seven times smaller than \(\gamma\)(\(T\)\(>\)\(T_{N}\)), which is typical of Ce-based magnets.[19] No superconductivity is found above 50 mK in CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\) in 0.1 T at ambient pressure.

Figure 2 provides evidence for pressure-induced bulk superconductivity in CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\) from ac-calorimetry measurements, plotted as \(C/T\) vs \(T\) at various pressures up to \(P\) = 3.53 GPa as shown in Fig. 2(a) on sample A. The anomaly at \(T_{N}\)=5.5 K increases with pressure up to \(\sim\)1.8 GPa, then decreases rapidly above that pressure such that only a broad anomaly is observed at 3 K at 3.12 GPa. Below 3 K, a single peak is found below 1 GPa due to the AFM transition of a Ce\({}_{3}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)In\({}_{13}\) impurity phase [Fig. 2(b)], which follows the monotonic behavior found previously up to 1.26 GPa.[20] Above 1 GPa, another peak attributed to bulk superconductivity is observed, the temperature of which increases monotonically with pressure from \(T_{c}\)=1.2 K (1.4 GPa) to 1.75 K (2.85 GPa) and the peak height remains small where there is coexistence with AFM order. Above 2.85 GPa, the superconducting anomaly increases up to \(T_{c}\)=2.1 K and the specific-heat jump D\(C\) is largest at 3.53 GPa where the Neel transition extrapolates to zero temperature.

  The temperature-pressure (_T_-_P_) phase diagram of CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\) is shown in Fig. 3(a). The AFM transition first increases with pressure up to 1.5 GPa then decreases with increasing pressure and is absent once it intersects superconductivity. Superconductivity appears at \(\sim\)1 K above 1 GPa and reaches a maximal value of _T_c=2.1 K at _P_c=3.5 GPa where _T_N(_P_) extrapolates to _T_=0 K. Electrical-resistivity measurements confirm a superconducting state and are generally consistent with the ac-calorimetry data. As with CeRhIn\({}_{5}\)[12], resistivity gives slightly higher _T_c's when AFM order is present.

Several properties provide strong evidence for an enhancement of the effective mass near the antiferromagnetic quantum critical point in CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\). Accompanying a large increase in the specific-heat jump at _T_c, \(\Delta C/C_{N}\), as \(P\) \(\rightarrow\)_P_c [Fig. 3(c)], the initial slope of the upper critical field \(-dH_{c2}/dT_{c}\), from Fig. 3(b), is 1.08, 4.50, and 5.52 T/K at _P_=2.45 GPa, 2.95 GPa, and 3.0 GPa, respectively. With \(-dH_{c2}/dT_{c}\)\(\sim\)\(\,\)\(m^{+}\)2\(T_{c}\), this implies that \(m^{+}\)\(\sim\)\(\,\)60\(m_{e}\), 80\(m_{e}\), and 90\(m_{e}\) in this pressure sequence.[21] In addition, as shown in Fig. 3(d) the normal-state _T_c coefficient of _ρ_ increases rapidly upon approaching _P_c, which is expected as a quantum critical point is approached.[4] At 3 GPa and 9 T [\(>\)_H_c2(0)], \(A\) = 4.03 \(\mu\Omega\) cm/K\({}^{2}\), which is 40 times larger than the value at ambient pressure. From the Kadowaki-Woods ratio, this \(A\) implies \(\gamma\)=630 \(\mu\Omega\)/mol K\({}^{2}\), which is nearly twice the paramagnetic value at ambient pressure. We also note that this _γ_ may be underestimated because \(A\) was determined in a high field.

The picture that emerges is that the effective mass of CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\) is enhanced on approaching the antiferromagnetic quantum critical point at _P_c=3.5 GPa. A broad dome of superconductivity with a maximum _T_c of 2.1 K appears close to this critical pressure. The large initial slope of the upper critical field and specific-heat jump near _P_c indicate intimate involvement of heavy quasiparticles in the superconductivity, and the remarkable similarity to CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) (Ref. [12]) suggests that the superconductivity also is unconventional. As shown in Fig. 1(d), the calculated Fermi surface of CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\) is comprised of three, nearly ideal cylindrical sheets, compared to corrugated cylindrical sheets in CeRhIn\({}_{5}\), one of which is shown in Fig. 1(e). Recent NMR measurements provide further evidence for the two-dimensional nature of CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\) and the presence of 2D antiferromagnetic fluctuations above _T_N\({}_{s}\)[22] Thus, it appears that 2D AFM critical fluctuations at the QCP dictate the behavior of CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\).

Though the more two-dimensional crystal structure (and fluctuations) of CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\) might be expected to lead to a higher _T_c than in any Ce\(M\)In\({}_{5}\) material,[5] weaker _f-d_ hybridization may limit the value of _T_c in CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\). Support for this possibility is provided by calculations comparing the density of states (DOS) of CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) and CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\). The paramagnetic scalar-relativistic projected electron DOS vs \(E\) relative to the Fermi energy \(E\) for Ce 4_f, Rh 4\(d\), and Pt 5\(d\) is shown in Fig. 4. The Rh 4\(d\) and Pt 5\(d\) states are located about 2-3 eV below _E_F, respectively, while the Ce 4\(f\) states are located 0.5 eV above _E_F. The extra electron of Pt does not significantly

  affect the band structure and only shifts \(E_{F}\) up by \(\sim\)0.1 eV. There is some hybridization between Ce 4\(f\) and Rh 4\(d\), which produces a gap near \(E_{F}\) that is found as well in more sophisticated local-density approximation plus dynamical mean field theory calculations.[15] In contrast, hybridization between Ce 4\(f\) and Pt 5\(d\) is sufficiently weak to obscure a gap, if present at all. This difference is due in part to the larger nearest-neighbor Ce-\(M\) bond distance in CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\) compared to that in CeRhIn\({}_{5}\), which may account in part for the higher pressure necessary to suppress magnetic order in CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\).

An interesting question is whether higher \(T_{c}\)'s might be found in other hypothetical Ce\(M_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\) (\(M\) = Co, Rh, Pd, Pt) compounds. In the Ce115 family, the transition metal tunes hybridization between the 4\(f\) and out-of-plane In, which appears to be a dominating factor.[15] In the Ce127 structure, the In(3) site plays the equivalent role (Fig. 1), and we consider specifically the effect that the In(3) bandwidth might have on \(T_{c}\). A Lorentzian fit to the In(3) DOS (not shown) yields a bandwidth \(W^{\rm(III)}\) of 3.6 eV, 5.9 eV, 4.1 eV, and 5.0 eV for \(M\) = Co, Rh, Pd, and Pt, respectively. Hybridization of Ce \(f\) and In \(p\) electrons will broaden the \(f\) level to a width \(\Gamma\) = \(\pi\langle V_{kj}^{2}\rangle N_{p}^{eff}(E_{F})\) in the Kondo limit, where \(V_{kj}^{2}\) is the matrix element that mixes \(f\)-electron/conduction-electron states. As argued earlier,[14, 23]\(\Gamma\) sets the energy scale for superconductivity in families of strongly correlated systems, i.e., \(\Gamma\) \(\propto\) \(T_{0}\)\(\propto\) \(T_{c}\). Assuming \(\langle V_{kj}^{2}\rangle\) is a constant in this structure and that \(N_{p}^{eff}(E_{F})\) \(\sim\) 1 / \(W^{\rm(III)}\), then from the relation \(T_{c}\) \(\propto\) \(T_{0}\).[14] we expect a higher \(T_{c}\) for \(M\) = Co and Pd and a lower \(T_{c}\) for \(M\) = Rh (relative to 2.1 K in CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\)). These very qualitative estimates suggest that the hybridization and anisotropy may be further optimized in these two-dimensional Ce\(M_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\). More realistic calculations and the search for additional Ce\(M_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\) materials are worthwhile.

In summary, the heavy electron antiferromagnet CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\) is a new, more two-dimensional member of the Ce\({}_{m}\)\(M_{2}\)In\({}_{8}\)\({}_{m=2n}\) family. Bulk superconductivity with a maximum transition temperature \(T_{c}\) = 2.1 K is induced as magnetic order is tuned toward an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point at a critical pressure \(P_{c}\) = 3.5 GPa. An analysis of physical properties reveals an enhancement of the effective mass near the QCP, possibly associated with 2D AFM fluctuations. Electronic-structure calculations indicate relatively weaker \(f\)-\(d\) hybridization in CePt\({}_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\) compared to CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) but greater anisotropy in the 127 structure compensates this effect to give a comparable \(T_{c}\) in both systems. Further enhancement of \(T_{c}\) may be found in other Ce\(M_{2}\)In\({}_{7}\) materials.
