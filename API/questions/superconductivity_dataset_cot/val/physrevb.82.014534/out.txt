Single crystals of Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2}, x < 0.37, have been grown and characterized by structural, magnetic, and transport measurements. These measurements show that the structural/magnetic phase transition found in pure BaFe_{2}As_{2} at 134 K is suppressed monotonically by Ru doping but, unlike doping with _T_M = Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, or Pd, the coupled transition seen in the parent compound does not detectably split into two separate ones. Superconductivity is stabilized at low temperatures for x > 0.2 and continues through the highest doping levels we report. The superconducting region is domelike, with maximum _T_c (~16.5 K) found around x ~ 0.29. A phase diagram of temperature versus doping, based on electrical transport and magnetization measurements, has been constructed and compared to those of the Ba(Fe_{1-x}_T_M_{x})_{2}As_{2} (_T_M = Co, Ni, Rh, and Pd) series as well as to the temperature-pressure phase diagram for pure BaFe_{2}As_{2}. Suppression of the structural/magnetic phase transition as well as the appearance of superconductivity is much more gradual in Ru doping, as compared to Co, Ni, Rh, and Pd doping, and appears to have more in common with BaFe_{2}As_{2} tuned with pressure; by plotting _T_S/_T_m and _T_c as a function of changes in unit-cell dimensions, we find that changes in the _c/a_ ratio, rather than changes in c, a, or V, unify the _T_(_p_) and _T_(_x_) phase diagrams for BaFe_{2}As_{2} and Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2}, respectively.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in F-doped LaFeAsO (Ref. 1) and K-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. 2) in 2008 led to extensive interest in these families of FeAs-based compounds. The superconducting critical temperature, _T_c, has risen as high as 56 K for F-doped _R_FeAsO (Ref. 3) and as high as 38 K in K- and Na-doped _A_Fe_{2}As_{2} systems (_AE_=Ba, Sr, and Ca). [2] Superconductivity was also found in Co-doped _A_Fe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. 4) and _R_FeAsO. [3] More recently, superconductivity has been found in other 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal, electron-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} systems, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] as well as SrFe_{2}As_{2} and CaFe_{2}As_{2}. Although the electron doped _A_Fe_{2}As_{2} systems have lower _T_c values than the hole-doped ones, [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] they have been studied extensively because doping is more homogeneous in these systems and single crystals can be more easily and reproducibly grown. In order to understand the conditions for superconductivity in these systems, temperature versus doping phase diagrams must first be constructed. Detailed studies have been made for _TM_-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} (_TM_ = Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, Pd, Pt, and Ir). [6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] For Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, and Pd, temperature vs doping concentration, x, and temperature vs electron count, e, phase diagrams show similar properties, with the temperature of the structural/magnetic transition, _T_S/_T_m, seen in the parent compound being suppressed and separated in a similar manner with x, and _T_c evolving in a similar manner with e, especially on the overdoped side of the superconducting dome. [6, 10, 14, 17] Although _TM_ doping of the BaFe_{2}As_{2} system is convenient--providing large homogeneous crystals--it is not unique in tuning _T_S/_T_m and _T_c. Pressure can also be used to suppress _T_S/_T_m and stabilize a low-temperature superconducting state. [18, 19, 20]

In contrast with its 4d neighbors Rh and Pd, Ru doping provides no extra electrons to the bands. However, recent polycrystalline studies in both the SrFe_{2}As_{2} (Refs. 21 and 22) and BaFe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. 7) systems show that Ru substitution on the Fe site suppresses the structural/magnetic phase transition and leads to superconductivity, indicating that this system may allow a direct comparison of nominally isovalent doping and electron doping _TM_ substitution as well as pressure studies. Isovalent doping induced superconductivity, as pressure before it, indicates that whereas x and e are important parameters in parametrizing the phase transitions in these systems, changes in the unit-cell parameter may be important as well.

Based on this, we have studied Ru-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} single crystals in order to compare the effects of isoelectronic doping to 3d and 4d transition metal, electron-doped compounds. As we wrote this work up, a similar, complimentary, study was posted; [23, 24] comparison to these data will be made as well.

## II Experimental methods

Single crystals of Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2} were grown out of self-flux using conventional high-temperature solution growth techniques. [10, 25] FeAs and RuAs were synthesized in the same manner as in Ref. 10. Small Ba chunks and FeAs/ RuAs powder were mixed together in a ratio of Ba: _T_M/As = 1 : 4. The mixture was then placed in an alumina crucible with a "catch" crucible filled with quartz wool placed on top. Both crucibles were sealed in a silica tube under 1/6 atmosphere of Ar gas. The sealed tube was heated up to 1180 ^{\circ}C over 12 h, held at 1180 ^{\circ}C for 8-12 h and then cooled over 45-65 h. The final temperature varied between 1050 and 1100 ^{\circ}C, increasing with the Ru-doping level. Once the furnace reached the final temperature, the excess FeAs/RuAs liquid was decanted, leaving the single crystals behind. Unfortunately, this increasing decanting temperature made doping levels above x = 0.37 difficult to produce.

  Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements with a Si standard, were performed using a Rigaku Miniflex diffractometer with Cu _K\alpha_ radiation at room temperature. Diffraction patterns were taken on ground single crystals from each batch. Only very small FeAs impurity peaks were found as a secondary phase. The unit-cell parameters were refined by "Rietica" software. Elemental analysis of single-crystal samples was used to determine the actual percentage of the dopant in the lattice as opposed to the nominal doping level. This was performed using wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDS) in a JEOL JXA-8200 electron microprobe. Magnetization data were collected in a Quantum Design (QD) Magnetic Properties Measurement System (MPMS). Temperature-dependent ac electrical resistance data (_f_=16 Hz, _I_=3 mA) was collected using either a QD MPMS with a LR700 resistance bridge or a QD Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS). Electrical contact was made to the sample using Epotek H20E silver epoxy to attach Pt wires in a four-probe configuration.

## III Results

A summary of the WDS measurement data is presented in Table I. For each batch, between 1 and 5 crystal surfaces were measured. The table shows the number of points measured, the nominal x value measured, the average x value, and two times the standard deviation of the x values measured. All x values given in this paper are the average _x_WDS values determined by WDS. Figure 1 shows the measured vs nominal Ru concentration, as well as the error bars on the measured values. For _x_WDS <= 0.21 the variation in Ru content within a batch is small, in the range of 1-5 % of the x value. Such variation is similar to what is found for other 3_d_- and 4_d_-doping series.[6, 10, 14, 17] For x <= 0.24 there is a sudden and rather dramatic increase in the variation in the Ru concentration within a single batch (and even a single sample). It is not clear what the origin of the change in homogeneity is but it is also noted, in a qualitative manner, in Ref. [23] as well.

Powder x-ray diffraction measurements confirm that Ba(Fe1-_x_Ru_x_)2As2 forms in the I4/_mmm_, ThCr2Si2 structure and that impurities are minimal (Fig. 2). Rietveld refinement of the XRD data gives the a and c lattice parameters, which are plotted, along with the unit-cell volume, as a function of _x_WDS in Fig. 3.

Figure 4 shows the normalized electrical resistance data of the Ba(Fe1-_x_Ru_x_)2As2 series from 5 to 300 K. Normalized resistance is plotted instead of resistivity because of the tendency of these samples to exfoliate or crack.[10, 26, 27] The anomaly in normalized resistance at 134 K for pure BaFe2As2 is associated with a first-order phase transition into an orthorhombic antiferromagnetic state.[28] As in the case of Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, and Pd substitution,[6, 10, 14, 17] the temperature of the resistive anomaly is suppressed monotonically and the shape is changed from the sharp loss of resistance on cooling

For x  \geq 0.29, anomalies associated with T_{S^{\prime}}/T_{m} are no longer detectable. Superconductivity begins to appear above x = 0.161 (resistive onset only) and is fully manifested (R = 0) by x = 0.210. A maximum T_{c} of 16.5 K is achieved at x = 0.29. T_{c} is suppressed for higher values of x. The superconducting transition is quite broad compared to other TM dopings: more than 7 K wide for x_{\text{WDS}} = 0.210 compared with a 3 K width for a Co-doping level of x = 0.038.[10] Such a wide transition is more typical of pressure induced superconductivity rather than chemical doping.[20]

Figure 5(a) shows high-field (H = 70 kOe) M/H data for representative members of the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2} series. At high temperatures the M(T)/H ratio is roughly linear and decreases with decreasing temperature with a slope that decreases with increasing Ru doping. As with normalized resistance, the magnetization of the parent compound manifests a clear change at 134 K, correlated with the structural/magnetic phase transition.[28] As x is increased up to x = 0.126, this transition is suppressed and broadened without qualitative change. Starting with x = 0.161 the transition becomes much flatter and broader, and by x = 0.24 it is barely visible. At x = 0.29 it has completely vanished.

Figure 5(b) shows the low-field (50 Oe) M/H data for the superconducting members of the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2} series. These samples show a clear diamagnetic signal in the zero-field cooled (ZFC) data, as well as some Meissner expulsion. It is worth noting that whereas the ZFC diamagnetic signal for Co, Ni, Rh, Pd, and Cu/Co dopings are all similar and close to -1/4\pi,[6, 10, 14, 17, 20] the low-temperature values for Ru doping [Fig. 5(b)] are smaller in amplitude and vary more.

## IV Discussion

Figures 6 and 7 show normalized resistance and magnetization data, along with their derivatives, for x = 0.073 and x = 0.16 samples, respectively. These figures show the criteria used for determining the structural/magnetic phase-transition temperatures for these materials.

Figures 6(c) and 7(c) show comparisons of normalized resistance derivatives for Ru-, Co-, and Rh-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} with similar T_{S}/T_{m} values. In the Co and Rh series, a clear splitting of the two transitions is visible. (At the same temperatures, the derivatives of magnetization and heat capacity show split features as well.[6, 10, 14, 17]) By contrast, we do not see these separated features in the derivatives of the normalized resistance from the Ru system. These features have been shown to correspond to a splitting of the joint transition into two transitions, one structural the other magnetic.[6, 14, 16, 17, 30] Although the authors of Ref. [23] claim to see a split transition, it appears to be a subtle feature compared to Co or Rh data. The single feature in the Ru-doped series dR/dT data suggests that either the splitting is much smaller, or absent, in this system or that the resistive feature associated with T_{S} is much weaker in this system. It is possible that the splitting is caused by the extra electrons provided by other _TM_ doping (e.g., Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, and Pd).

Onset and offset criteria were used to determine T_{c} from this resistance data. T_{c} was determined from the magnetization data by extrapolating the maximum slope of the ZFC data back to the normal state. There is fair agreement between T_{c}^{offset} determined from normalized resistance and T_{c} determined from magnetization. It should be noted, though, that (i) superconductivity primarily occurs in the region where the spread in x_{\rm WDS} is large and (ii) the superconducting transition is broad in R(T) and both ZFC and field cooled Meissner data are somewhat lower than for other _TM_-doped series.

Using these criteria, the data presented in Figs. 4 and 5 are summarized in a _T-x_ phase diagram shown in Fig. 8. Overall, the phase diagram for the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2} series is qualitatively quite similar to that of the Co, Ni, Rh, and Pd diagrams: increasing x suppresses the structural/magnetic phase transition, a superconducting dome appears above some critical x value and this dome has a maximum near the point where T_{S}/T_{m} extrapolates to zero. However, there is a key difference: suppression of T_{S}/T_{m} is much slower than for other _TM_ dopings (Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, and Pd).[6, 14, 17, 10, 14] In previous comparisons of 3d and 4d _TM_ dopings,[6, 14, 17] we showed that suppression of T_{S}/T_{m} occurs at roughly the same rate regardless of differences in size and electron count between dopants; the suppression of T_{S}/T_{m} in Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2} is about three times slower.

As in the case of Rh- and Pd-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2},[6] with Ru doping the _c_-lattice parameter shrinks compared to the parent BaFe_{2}As_{2} while the _a_-lattice parameter and the unit-cell volume, V, grow. (This is in contrast to the 3d _TM_ dopings, where all three shrink with increasing x.) By way of comparison: a Ru-doping level of x_{\rm WDS}=0.175 has a = 1.002a_{0} and c = 0.995c_{0}, and a Rh doping level of x = 0.171 has a

 = 1.007a_{0} and c =0.988c_{0}.[6] Because the crystallographic trends of all three 4_d TM_ dopant series (Ru, Rh, and Pd) are similar, the major differences in their _T-x_ phase diagrams suggest that steric effects alone are not enough to explain the differences in behavior of this system with doping (i.e., the extra electrons in Rh and Pd are responsible for the much more rapid effects of doping).

Although the maximum superconducting critical temperature, T_{c}^{max}, is significantly lower in the Ru-doped system, there is a clear similarity between the Ru-doped _T-x_ phase diagram and the pressure dependent, _T-p_, phase diagram of the parent BaFe_{2}As_{2} compound,[20] as can be seen in Fig. 9. The similarity of the phase diagrams suggests that changes in the unit-cell dimensions may be playing a large role in determining the superconducting behavior with the effects of Ru substitution in this system being similar to physical pressure in the undoped BaFe_{2}As_{2} system. The difference in T_{c}^{max} is most likely caused by the Ru dopant disordering the Fe plane whereas pressure induces no such distortion.

Whereas the agreement between the _T-x_ and _T-p_ phase diagrams in Fig. 9 is good, the scaling between x and p was arbitrarily chosen to optimize the overlap of the two data sets. Using our data on the _x_-dependence of the unit-cell parameters (Fig. 3) in combination with the data from Ref. 31 on the pressure dependence of the unit-cell parameters of BaFe_{2}As_{2}, we can make this comparison more quantitative. Of the four combinations of the unit-cell parameters: a, c, V, and _c_/_a_, only c and _c_/_a_ show similar responses to pressure and doping; a and V both increase with doping whereas they decrease with p. Figures 10(a) and 10(b) present our Ru-doping data as well as the pressure data from Ref. 20 plotted as functions of the changes in c and _c_/_a_. A comparison of these two figures clearly indicates that _c_/_a_ rather than c better parametrizes the effects of doping and pressure. This result means that, based on _these two_ isoelectronic perturbations (pressure and Ru doping), changes in the _c_/_a_ ratio appear to be more physically important than changes in c alone.

The other isoelectronic substitution which produces superconductivity in BaFe_{2}As_{2} is P doping on the As site.[32, 33] Although the maximum _T_c in the BaFe_{2}(As_{1-\text{P}}x_{2})_{2} system is quite a bit higher than in the Ba(Fe_{1-\text{R}}u_{x})_{2}As_{2} system (\sim30 K), several key properties are similar. _T__S_/_T__m_ is suppressed in a relatively gradual manner and the maximum

  value occurs at a comparably high doping level (_x_Ru = 0.29, _x_P = 0.32) and extends over a much wider range than in any of the electron doped _TM_ series.[32, 23] Furthermore, both Ru doping and underdoping of P produce wider transitions than other _TM_ dopings (e.g., Co, Ni, Rh, and Pd).[6, 10, 33, 34] On the other hand, taking changes in c and a with P doping into account, _T_{S}/T_{m}_ and _T_{c}_ for P-doped and Ru-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} scale better with changes in c than with changes in c/a.[33] This means that, if we include P doping as a third isoelectronic perturbation, then neither changes in c nor c/a universally describe the _T-x_ and _T-p_ phase diagrams.

## V Summary

Single crystals of Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2} can be grown for x< 0.37, although Ru homogeneity becomes less well controlled for x> 0.21. The structural and magnetic phase-transition temperature, _T_{S}/T_{m}_, is suppressed as x increases but does not clearly split, as it does for _TM_ = Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, and Pd doping. As _T_{S}/T_{m}_ is suppressed superconductivity appears, reaching a maximum _T_{c}_ value of 16.5 K for x =0.29, near the point that _T_{S}/T_{m}_ extrapolates to T = 0 K. Whereas the suppression of _T_{S}/T_{m}_ and the stabilization of _T_{c}_ occur at a much slower rate for Ru doping than they do for doping with _TM_ = Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, or Pd, indicating that the additional electrons brought by these dopants play a significant role in tuning of this system, there is a remarkable agreement between two isoelectronic phase diagrams (Ru doping and pressure) of BaFe_{2}As_{2} when plotted as _T_(c/a) but not when plotted as _T_(c).

Single crystals of Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2}, x < 0.37, have been grown and characterized by structural, magnetic, and transport measurements. These measurements show that the structural/magnetic phase transition found in pure BaFe_{2}As_{2} at 134 K is suppressed monotonically by Ru doping but, unlike doping with _T_M = Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, or Pd, the coupled transition seen in the parent compound does not detectably split into two separate ones. Superconductivity is stabilized at low temperatures for x > 0.2 and continues through the highest doping levels we report. The superconducting region is domelike, with maximum _T_c (~16.5 K) found around x ~ 0.29. A phase diagram of temperature versus doping, based on electrical transport and magnetization measurements, has been constructed and compared to those of the Ba(Fe_{1-x}_T_M_{x})_{2}As_{2} (_T_M = Co, Ni, Rh, and Pd) series as well as to the temperature-pressure phase diagram for pure BaFe_{2}As_{2}. Suppression of the structural/magnetic phase transition as well as the appearance of superconductivity is much more gradual in Ru doping, as compared to Co, Ni, Rh, and Pd doping, and appears to have more in common with BaFe_{2}As_{2} tuned with pressure; by plotting _T_S/_T_m and _T_c as a function of changes in unit-cell dimensions, we find that changes in the _c/a_ ratio, rather than changes in c, a, or V, unify the _T_(_p_) and _T_(_x_) phase diagrams for BaFe_{2}As_{2} and Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2}, respectively.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in F-doped LaFeAsO (Ref. 1) and K-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. 2) in 2008 led to extensive interest in these families of FeAs-based compounds. The superconducting critical temperature, _T_c, has risen as high as 56 K for F-doped _R_FeAsO (Ref. 3) and as high as 38 K in K- and Na-doped _A_Fe_{2}As_{2} systems (_AE_=Ba, Sr, and Ca). [2] Superconductivity was also found in Co-doped _A_Fe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. 4) and _R_FeAsO. [3] More recently, superconductivity has been found in other 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal, electron-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} systems, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] as well as SrFe_{2}As_{2} and CaFe_{2}As_{2}. Although the electron doped _A_Fe_{2}As_{2} systems have lower _T_c values than the hole-doped ones, [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] they have been studied extensively because doping is more homogeneous in these systems and single crystals can be more easily and reproducibly grown. In order to understand the conditions for superconductivity in these systems, temperature versus doping phase diagrams must first be constructed. Detailed studies have been made for _TM_-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} (_TM_ = Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, Pd, Pt, and Ir). [6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] For Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, and Pd, temperature vs doping concentration, x, and temperature vs electron count, e, phase diagrams show similar properties, with the temperature of the structural/magnetic transition, _T_S/_T_m, seen in the parent compound being suppressed and separated in a similar manner with x, and _T_c evolving in a similar manner with e, especially on the overdoped side of the superconducting dome. [6, 10, 14, 17] Although _TM_ doping of the BaFe_{2}As_{2} system is convenient--providing large homogeneous crystals--it is not unique in tuning _T_S/_T_m and _T_c. Pressure can also be used to suppress _T_S/_T_m and stabilize a low-temperature superconducting state. [18, 19, 20]

In contrast with its 4d neighbors Rh and Pd, Ru doping provides no extra electrons to the bands. However, recent polycrystalline studies in both the SrFe_{2}As_{2} (Refs. 21 and 22) and BaFe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. 7) systems show that Ru substitution on the Fe site suppresses the structural/magnetic phase transition and leads to superconductivity, indicating that this system may allow a direct comparison of nominally isovalent doping and electron doping _TM_ substitution as well as pressure studies. Isovalent doping induced superconductivity, as pressure before it, indicates that whereas x and e are important parameters in parametrizing the phase transitions in these systems, changes in the unit-cell parameter may be important as well.

Based on this, we have studied Ru-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} single crystals in order to compare the effects of isoelectronic doping to 3d and 4d transition metal, electron-doped compounds. As we wrote this work up, a similar, complimentary, study was posted; [23, 24] comparison to these data will be made as well.

## II Experimental methods

Single crystals of Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2} were grown out of self-flux using conventional high-temperature solution growth techniques. [10, 25] FeAs and RuAs were synthesized in the same manner as in Ref. 10. Small Ba chunks and FeAs/ RuAs powder were mixed together in a ratio of Ba: _T_M/As = 1 : 4. The mixture was then placed in an alumina crucible with a "catch" crucible filled with quartz wool placed on top. Both crucibles were sealed in a silica tube under 1/6 atmosphere of Ar gas. The sealed tube was heated up to 1180 ^{\circ}C over 12 h, held at 1180 ^{\circ}C for 8-12 h and then cooled over 45-65 h. The final temperature varied between 1050 and 1100 ^{\circ}C, increasing with the Ru-doping level. Once the furnace reached the final temperature, the excess FeAs/RuAs liquid was decanted, leaving the single crystals behind. Unfortunately, this increasing decanting temperature made doping levels above x = 0.37 difficult to produce.

  Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements with a Si standard, were performed using a Rigaku Miniflex diffractometer with Cu _K\alpha_ radiation at room temperature. Diffraction patterns were taken on ground single crystals from each batch. Only very small FeAs impurity peaks were found as a secondary phase. The unit-cell parameters were refined by "Rietica" software. Elemental analysis of single-crystal samples was used to determine the actual percentage of the dopant in the lattice as opposed to the nominal doping level. This was performed using wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDS) in a JEOL JXA-8200 electron microprobe. Magnetization data were collected in a Quantum Design (QD) Magnetic Properties Measurement System (MPMS). Temperature-dependent ac electrical resistance data (_f_=16 Hz, _I_=3 mA) was collected using either a QD MPMS with a LR700 resistance bridge or a QD Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS). Electrical contact was made to the sample using Epotek H20E silver epoxy to attach Pt wires in a four-probe configuration.

## III Results

A summary of the WDS measurement data is presented in Table I. For each batch, between 1 and 5 crystal surfaces were measured. The table shows the number of points measured, the nominal x value measured, the average x value, and two times the standard deviation of the x values measured. All x values given in this paper are the average _x_WDS values determined by WDS. Figure 1 shows the measured vs nominal Ru concentration, as well as the error bars on the measured values. For _x_WDS <= 0.21 the variation in Ru content within a batch is small, in the range of 1-5 % of the x value. Such variation is similar to what is found for other 3_d_- and 4_d_-doping series.[6, 10, 14, 17] For x <= 0.24 there is a sudden and rather dramatic increase in the variation in the Ru concentration within a single batch (and even a single sample). It is not clear what the origin of the change in homogeneity is but it is also noted, in a qualitative manner, in Ref. [23] as well.

Powder x-ray diffraction measurements confirm that Ba(Fe1-_x_Ru_x_)2As2 forms in the I4/_mmm_, ThCr2Si2 structure and that impurities are minimal (Fig. 2). Rietveld refinement of the XRD data gives the a and c lattice parameters, which are plotted, along with the unit-cell volume, as a function of _x_WDS in Fig. 3.

Figure 4 shows the normalized electrical resistance data of the Ba(Fe1-_x_Ru_x_)2As2 series from 5 to 300 K. Normalized resistance is plotted instead of resistivity because of the tendency of these samples to exfoliate or crack.[10, 26, 27] The anomaly in normalized resistance at 134 K for pure BaFe2As2 is associated with a first-order phase transition into an orthorhombic antiferromagnetic state.[28] As in the case of Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, and Pd substitution,[6, 10, 14, 17] the temperature of the resistive anomaly is suppressed monotonically and the shape is changed from the sharp loss of resistance on cooling

For x  \geq 0.29, anomalies associated with T_{S^{\prime}}/T_{m} are no longer detectable. Superconductivity begins to appear above x = 0.161 (resistive onset only) and is fully manifested (R = 0) by x = 0.210. A maximum T_{c} of 16.5 K is achieved at x = 0.29. T_{c} is suppressed for higher values of x. The superconducting transition is quite broad compared to other TM dopings: more than 7 K wide for x_{\text{WDS}} = 0.210 compared with a 3 K width for a Co-doping level of x = 0.038.[10] Such a wide transition is more typical of pressure induced superconductivity rather than chemical doping.[20]

Figure 5(a) shows high-field (H = 70 kOe) M/H data for representative members of the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2} series. At high temperatures the M(T)/H ratio is roughly linear and decreases with decreasing temperature with a slope that decreases with increasing Ru doping. As with normalized resistance, the magnetization of the parent compound manifests a clear change at 134 K, correlated with the structural/magnetic phase transition.[28] As x is increased up to x = 0.126, this transition is suppressed and broadened without qualitative change. Starting with x = 0.161 the transition becomes much flatter and broader, and by x = 0.24 it is barely visible. At x = 0.29 it has completely vanished.

Figure 5(b) shows the low-field (50 Oe) M/H data for the superconducting members of the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2} series. These samples show a clear diamagnetic signal in the zero-field cooled (ZFC) data, as well as some Meissner expulsion. It is worth noting that whereas the ZFC diamagnetic signal for Co, Ni, Rh, Pd, and Cu/Co dopings are all similar and close to -1/4\pi,[6, 10, 14, 17, 20] the low-temperature values for Ru doping [Fig. 5(b)] are smaller in amplitude and vary more.

## IV Discussion

Figures 6 and 7 show normalized resistance and magnetization data, along with their derivatives, for x = 0.073 and x = 0.16 samples, respectively. These figures show the criteria used for determining the structural/magnetic phase-transition temperatures for these materials.

Figures 6(c) and 7(c) show comparisons of normalized resistance derivatives for Ru-, Co-, and Rh-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} with similar T_{S}/T_{m} values. In the Co and Rh series, a clear splitting of the two transitions is visible. (At the same temperatures, the derivatives of magnetization and heat capacity show split features as well.[6, 10, 14, 17]) By contrast, we do not see these separated features in the derivatives of the normalized resistance from the Ru system. These features have been shown to correspond to a splitting of the joint transition into two transitions, one structural the other magnetic.[6, 14, 16, 17, 30] Although the authors of Ref. [23] claim to see a split transition, it appears to be a subtle feature compared to Co or Rh data. The single feature in the Ru-doped series dR/dT data suggests that either the splitting is much smaller, or absent, in this system or that the resistive feature associated with T_{S} is much weaker in this system. It is possible that the splitting is caused by the extra electrons provided by other _TM_ doping (e.g., Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, and Pd).

Onset and offset criteria were used to determine T_{c} from this resistance data. T_{c} was determined from the magnetization data by extrapolating the maximum slope of the ZFC data back to the normal state. There is fair agreement between T_{c}^{offset} determined from normalized resistance and T_{c} determined from magnetization. It should be noted, though, that (i) superconductivity primarily occurs in the region where the spread in x_{\rm WDS} is large and (ii) the superconducting transition is broad in R(T) and both ZFC and field cooled Meissner data are somewhat lower than for other _TM_-doped series.

Using these criteria, the data presented in Figs. 4 and 5 are summarized in a _T-x_ phase diagram shown in Fig. 8. Overall, the phase diagram for the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2} series is qualitatively quite similar to that of the Co, Ni, Rh, and Pd diagrams: increasing x suppresses the structural/magnetic phase transition, a superconducting dome appears above some critical x value and this dome has a maximum near the point where T_{S}/T_{m} extrapolates to zero. However, there is a key difference: suppression of T_{S}/T_{m} is much slower than for other _TM_ dopings (Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, and Pd).[6, 14, 17, 10, 14] In previous comparisons of 3d and 4d _TM_ dopings,[6, 14, 17] we showed that suppression of T_{S}/T_{m} occurs at roughly the same rate regardless of differences in size and electron count between dopants; the suppression of T_{S}/T_{m} in Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2} is about three times slower.

As in the case of Rh- and Pd-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2},[6] with Ru doping the _c_-lattice parameter shrinks compared to the parent BaFe_{2}As_{2} while the _a_-lattice parameter and the unit-cell volume, V, grow. (This is in contrast to the 3d _TM_ dopings, where all three shrink with increasing x.) By way of comparison: a Ru-doping level of x_{\rm WDS}=0.175 has a = 1.002a_{0} and c = 0.995c_{0}, and a Rh doping level of x = 0.171 has a

 = 1.007a_{0} and c =0.988c_{0}.[6] Because the crystallographic trends of all three 4_d TM_ dopant series (Ru, Rh, and Pd) are similar, the major differences in their _T-x_ phase diagrams suggest that steric effects alone are not enough to explain the differences in behavior of this system with doping (i.e., the extra electrons in Rh and Pd are responsible for the much more rapid effects of doping).

Although the maximum superconducting critical temperature, T_{c}^{max}, is significantly lower in the Ru-doped system, there is a clear similarity between the Ru-doped _T-x_ phase diagram and the pressure dependent, _T-p_, phase diagram of the parent BaFe_{2}As_{2} compound,[20] as can be seen in Fig. 9. The similarity of the phase diagrams suggests that changes in the unit-cell dimensions may be playing a large role in determining the superconducting behavior with the effects of Ru substitution in this system being similar to physical pressure in the undoped BaFe_{2}As_{2} system. The difference in T_{c}^{max} is most likely caused by the Ru dopant disordering the Fe plane whereas pressure induces no such distortion.

Whereas the agreement between the _T-x_ and _T-p_ phase diagrams in Fig. 9 is good, the scaling between x and p was arbitrarily chosen to optimize the overlap of the two data sets. Using our data on the _x_-dependence of the unit-cell parameters (Fig. 3) in combination with the data from Ref. 31 on the pressure dependence of the unit-cell parameters of BaFe_{2}As_{2}, we can make this comparison more quantitative. Of the four combinations of the unit-cell parameters: a, c, V, and _c_/_a_, only c and _c_/_a_ show similar responses to pressure and doping; a and V both increase with doping whereas they decrease with p. Figures 10(a) and 10(b) present our Ru-doping data as well as the pressure data from Ref. 20 plotted as functions of the changes in c and _c_/_a_. A comparison of these two figures clearly indicates that _c_/_a_ rather than c better parametrizes the effects of doping and pressure. This result means that, based on _these two_ isoelectronic perturbations (pressure and Ru doping), changes in the _c_/_a_ ratio appear to be more physically important than changes in c alone.

The other isoelectronic substitution which produces superconductivity in BaFe_{2}As_{2} is P doping on the As site.[32, 33] Although the maximum _T_c in the BaFe_{2}(As_{1-\text{P}}x_{2})_{2} system is quite a bit higher than in the Ba(Fe_{1-\text{R}}u_{x})_{2}As_{2} system (\sim30 K), several key properties are similar. _T__S_/_T__m_ is suppressed in a relatively gradual manner and the maximum

  value occurs at a comparably high doping level (_x_Ru = 0.29, _x_P = 0.32) and extends over a much wider range than in any of the electron doped _TM_ series.[32, 23] Furthermore, both Ru doping and underdoping of P produce wider transitions than other _TM_ dopings (e.g., Co, Ni, Rh, and Pd).[6, 10, 33, 34] On the other hand, taking changes in c and a with P doping into account, _T_{S}/T_{m}_ and _T_{c}_ for P-doped and Ru-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} scale better with changes in c than with changes in c/a.[33] This means that, if we include P doping as a third isoelectronic perturbation, then neither changes in c nor c/a universally describe the _T-x_ and _T-p_ phase diagrams.

## V Summary

Single crystals of Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2} can be grown for x< 0.37, although Ru homogeneity becomes less well controlled for x> 0.21. The structural and magnetic phase-transition temperature, _T_{S}/T_{m}_, is suppressed as x increases but does not clearly split, as it does for _TM_ = Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, and Pd doping. As _T_{S}/T_{m}_ is suppressed superconductivity appears, reaching a maximum _T_{c}_ value of 16.5 K for x =0.29, near the point that _T_{S}/T_{m}_ extrapolates to T = 0 K. Whereas the suppression of _T_{S}/T_{m}_ and the stabilization of _T_{c}_ occur at a much slower rate for Ru doping than they do for doping with _TM_ = Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, or Pd, indicating that the additional electrons brought by these dopants play a significant role in tuning of this system, there is a remarkable agreement between two isoelectronic phase diagrams (Ru doping and pressure) of BaFe_{2}As_{2} when plotted as _T_(c/a) but not when plotted as _T_(c).
