###### Abstract

Through a combination of x-ray diffraction, electrical transport,
magnetic susceptibility, and heat-capacity measurements, we report the
effect of La doping on Sr in the newly discovered SrRiS₂ system.
Superconducting transition with critical temperature T_(c) of 2.8 K,
developed from a semiconducting-like normal state, was found in
Sr_(0.5)La_(0.5)FBiS₂. A strong diamagnetic signal and a clear
specific-heat anomaly associated with this transition were observed,
confirming bulk superconductivity. The upper critical field H_(c2)(0)
was estimated to be 1 T by using the Ginzburg-Landau approach. Our
experiments therefore demonstrate that bulk superconductivity can be
achieved by electron doping in the SrRiS₂ system.

Superconductivity within layered crystal structures has attracted
sustained interest in the community of correlated electron systems,
primarily due to the exotic superconducting properties they exhibit.
Notable examples include the high-T_(c) cuprates with the CuO₂ plane and
the Fe-based superconductors with Fe₂Ar₂ (An = P, As, and Se)
superconducting (SC) layers. Recently, superconductivity in the novel
BiS₂-based superconductor Bi₁₀Al₅Si₃ with a superconducting transition
temperature (T_(c)) of 8.6 K has been reported.¹ Immediately following
this result, several LnO_(1 − x)F_(x)BiS₂ (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd)
superconductors, with the highest T_(c) of 10 K,^(2, −6) have then been
discovered. While T_(c) is largely determined by a [Ln₂O₂]²⁻ blocking
layer in these systems, all these superconductors share the common BiS₂
layer. Although these BiS₂-based layered superconductors show a wealth
of similarities to the iron pnictides, some differences are also
manifest. First, the parent compound LnrOBiS₂ is a bad metal without
detectable antiferromagnetic transition or structure phase transition,
implying that magnetism is of less importance to superconductivity in
BiS₂-based systems. Second, resistivity measurements in BiS₂-based
systems suggest that superconductivity appears in close proximity to an
insulating normal state for the optimal superconducting sample,⁵ in
sharp contrast to the iron-based superconductors where superconductivity
grows from a metallic state. Interestingly, pairing symmetry in layered
BiS₂-based compounds has yet to be determined albeit some theorists
conjectured that BiS₂-based compounds are strongly electron-phonon
coupled superconductors, and the pairing symmetry may be an extended s
wave with full gaps on different parts of Fermi surfaces,^(7, 8) in
analogy to the iron-based superconductors.^(9, 10) However, the
experimental evidence of pairing symmetry is still lacking thus far.

Very recently, a new BiS₂-based layered compound SrBiS₂ has been
reported.¹¹ This compound is isostructural to LaOBiS₂, with the
[Ln₂O₂]²⁻ layer being replaced by an isocharged [Sr₂F₂]²⁻ block, similar
to the case of LaOFeAs and SrFFeAs. The resistivity of SrFBiS₂ shows the
semiconducting behavior, however, no superconductivity has been reported
in this system.

In this Rapid Communication, we report the successful synthesis and the
detailed characterization of La-doped Sr_(1 − x)La_(x)FBiS₂ (x = 0, 0.5)
samples. The parent compound SrFBiS₂ exhibits thermally excited
resistivity down to low temperature, consistent with the existing
literature.¹¹ As x = 0.5, resistivity at normal state still shows the
semiconducting behavior, but its absolute value drops by a factor of 2,
followed by a sharp superconducting transition below 2.8 K. The strong
diamagnetic signal and a clear specific-heat jump provide compelling
evidence of bulk superconductivity in the Sr_(1 − x)La_(x)FBiS₂ system.
Finally, the specific-heat data show evidence of strong-coupling nature
of the observed superconductivity.

The polycrystalline samples of Sr_(1 − x)La_(x)FBiS₂ (x = 0, 0.5) used
in this study were synthesized by a two-step solid state reaction
method. The starting materials–La pieces, SrF₂ powder, Bi and S
powder–are all of high purity (≥99.9

Crystal structure characterization was performed by powder x-ray
diffraction (XRD) at room temperature using a D/Max-rA diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation and a graphite monochromator. Lattice parameters
were obtained by Rietveld refinements. The electrical resistivity was
measured with a standard four-terminal method covering the temperature
range from 0.4 to 300 K in a commercial Quantum Design PPMS-9 system
with a ³He refrigeration insert. Specific-heat and Hall-effect
measurements were also performed in this system. The temperature
dependence of dc magnetization was measured on a Quantum Design MPMS-5.

Figure 1(a) shows the powder XRD patterns of the Sr_(1 − x)La_(x)FBiS₂
(x = 0, 0.5) samples. Overall, the main diffraction peaks of these two
samples can be well indexed based on a tetragonal cell structure with
the P4/nmm space group. Extra minor peaks arising from the impurity
phase of Bi₂S₃ can also be seen. The content of impurity phase Bi₂S₃
estimated by Rietveld fitting is about 15

The zero-field temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity (ρ)
of these two samples is plotted in Fig. 2(a). For the parent SrFBiS₂
compound, the resistivity clearly shows thermally activated behavior
with decreasing temperature from 300 K, and no resistivity anomaly can
be observed down to 2 K. The thermal activation energy (E_(a)) obtained
by fitting with the thermal activation formula
ρ(T) = ρ₀exp (E_(a)/k_(B)T) for the temperature range from 100 to 300 K
is about 38.2 meV, consistent with previous studies.[11] However, it is
noted that its absolute value is nearly two-thirds smaller than the
reported value by Lei _et al.[11]_ We attribute this to the impurity
phase of Bi₂S₃ with sulfur deficiency[12] in our sample which may
decrease the absolute value of resistivity. As Sr is partially replaced
by La (x = 0.5), the resistivity remains semiconducting-like at high
temperatures, with the magnitude of resistivity substantially reduced
compared to the undoped sample. Meanwhile, the E_(a) fitted at high
temperature also decreases to 8.6 meV, suggesting the decrease of gap
size because of electron doping. With further cooling down, a sharp
superconducting transition with T_(c) of 2.8 K is clearly seen. This
result is reminiscent of LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂, where the normal state
shows semiconducting behavior, and it undergoes superconducting
transition below 10 K.[2] Interestingly, the first-principles
calculations[7] have suggested that there may be a charge density wave
instability or an enhanced correlation effect in this system. Yet, no
such instability can be detected merely from the resistivity measurement
given in this study.

Figure 2(b) shows the close-up view of the low-temperature resistivity
for Sr_(0.5)La_(0.5)FBiS₂ samples under various magnetic fields below 4
K. The inset gives the temperature dependence of the upper critical
field μ₀H_(c2)(T), determined by using 90

H_(c2)(T) = H_(c2)(0)(1 − t²)/(1 + t²),
(1)

where t is the renormalized temperature _T_/T_(c). It is found that the
upper critical field H_(c2) as drawn can be well fitted by this model
and its zero-temperature limit is estimated to be 1.04 T.

In order to verify the bulk nature of the observed superconductivity,
the temperature dependence of dc magnetic susceptibility was measured
under 5 Oe magnetic field with both zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and
field-cooling (FC) modes for the superconducting samples (Fig. 3). The
strong diamagnetic signal was observed for the Sr_(0.5)La_(0.5)FBiS₂
sample. The T_(c) value determined from the magnetic susceptibility
agrees well with the one extracted from the resistivity data. The
estimated volume fraction of magnetic shielding from ZFC data is over 30

To further study its superconducting properties, the specific-heat
measurement of the Sr_(0.5)La_(0.5)FBiS₂ sample was performed in the
temperature range from 0.5 to 5 K. As plotted in Fig. 4, a clear
specific-heat jump can be observed at T_(c) = 2.8 K, further confirming
the bulk superconductivity. Below 1.5 K, however, the low-temperature
heat capacity undergoes a moderate upturn which very likely arises from
Schottky anomaly associated with the impurities phase or the freezing
out of La nuclear spins.[13] Taking into account the Schottky anomaly
component, the overall specific heat can be written as

C/T = γ + βT² + α/T³,
(2)

where γ and βT² account for the electronic and lattice contributions,
respectively, and the last term, α/T³, is the Schottky anomaly. The plot
of _C/T_-α/T³ versus T² shows a linear behavior in the high-temperature
range from 2.9 to 5 K (data not explicitly shown here). The resultant
electronic coefficient γ and the lattice coefficient β are 1.42 mJ/mol
K² and β = 0.414 mJ/mol K⁴, respectively. The Debye temperature is then
estimated to be 265 K. This value is somewhat smaller that those of
LaONiAs,[14] LaOFeP,[15] and LaO_(0.89)F_(0.11)FeAs.[16] The lattice
contribution was further subtracted in the inset in order to see the
clear specific-heat jump at the SC transition. The corresponding
electronic specific jump at T_(c), therefore, is estimated to be
ΔC_(c)/γ T_(c) = 1.4, very close to the weak-coupling
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) value of 1.43. Considering the
relatively low volume fraction of magnetic shielding suggested from
susceptibility measurement, the real size of ΔC_(c)/γ T_(c) ought to be
much larger than the BCS value, implying that SC in
Sr_(0.5)La_(0.5)FBiS₂ likely involves a strong electron-phonon coupling,
consistent with the theoretical prediction.[7]

Finally, the temperature dependence of Hall coefficient R_(H) for the
Sr_(0.5)La_(0.5)FBiS₂ sample is shown in Fig. 5. The negative R_(H)
signal covers the whole temperature region, indicating that the
electron-type charge carrier is dominant in this sample. Clearly, R_(H)
is T independent at the high-temperature regime, and drops drastically
below 50 K. The result reminds us of the similar behavior observed in
iron-based SC, where R_(H) decreases sharply due to spin-density-wave
(SDW) formation.[17] In the present sample, however, no SDW/CDW anomaly
has been observed in the measurements of resistivity and magnetization.
On the other hand, it is known that the inherent impurity phase may act
to smear out the anomalies in the resistivity and susceptibility. In
this regard, it would be interesting to clarify this problem by
first-principles calculations[7] or further improving the sample
quality. In a single-band metal, the Hall coefficient R_(H) is
associated with carrier density (n) as R_(H) = 1/ne. We therefore
estimate the charge-carrier density to be 1.05 × 10¹⁹/cm³ at 5 K, which
is similar to the Bi₄O₄S₃ system[18] and iron-based superconductors[19]
with a very low superfluid density. In addition, we cannot rule out the
multiband effect[5] as the origin of the drop in R_(H).

In summary, we study the electron doping effect, i.e., partially
substituting La for Sr, in the newly discovered SrBiS₂ system. The
parent compound shows semiconducting-like resistivity with decreasing
temperature. Via electron doping, we discovered a BiS₂-based
superconductor Sr_(0.5)La_(0.5)FBiS₂ with a T_(c) as high as 2.8 K.
Importantly, this superconductivity was found to develop on the
background of an insulating normal state, raising a question of whether
this superconductor is in proximity to a Mott insulator or a band
insulator. Based

on the heat-capacity measurement, we speculate that the superconducting
electron pairs might have a strong-coupled nature. In this regard, it
would certainly be interesting to identify the symmetry of
superconducting order parameter in this system along with other
BiS₂-based superconductors.
