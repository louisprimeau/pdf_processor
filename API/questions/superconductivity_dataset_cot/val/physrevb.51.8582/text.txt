###### Abstract

We report systematic studies of the normal-state conductivity and thermopower of epitaxial Y\({}_{1-a}\)Ca\({}_{a}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) thin films with \(0\leq x\leq 0.3\) as a function of oxygen content. The superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) is found to be parabolic in conductivity \(\sigma\) for each sample, with a universal scaling behavior for all films with \(x\leq 0.2\). The room-temperature thermopower, \(S_{295\ \mathrm{K}}\), follows the universal correlation between \(T_{c}\) and \(S_{295\ \mathrm{K}}\) reported by S. D. Obertelli _et al._ [Phys. Rev. B **46**, 14 928 (1992)] for all films studied, despite the reduction in maximum \(T_{c}\) with increasing calcium content. The thermopower is found to be superior to the conductivity as a measure of the hole concentration because of its reduced sensitivity to extrinsic contributions such as grain boundaries. By assuming that all the charge from oxygen deficiencies and Ca substitution is transferred to the Cu-O planes, and by using Obertelli's empirically-derived expression for hole concentration, we show that \(S_{295\ \mathrm{K}}\) can be used to determine the oxygen content of the films. The equilibrium oxygen content is found to be reduced to compensate for the additional carriers introduced by Ca substitution in these films, just as has been previously observed in bulk Y\({}_{1-a}\)Ca\({}_{a}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\).

## I Introduction

Understanding the manner in which the electronic properties of cuprate superconductors change with carrier doping is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. All copper oxide superconductors can be transformed from antiferromagnetic insulators, to superconductors, to metals as the doping is increased. In many systems, such as YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) (YBCO), the change in doping can be performed reversibly by varying the oxygen stoichiometry \(\delta\) through a series of relatively low-temperature anneals. The carrier concentration on the copper oxide planes is usually determined by doping on layers which are well separated from the planes, thus allowing one to adjust the carrier concentration without introducing additional scattering centers in the actively conducting regions.

Cation substitution can also be used to dope cuprate superconductors. In YBCO, Ca\({}^{2+}\) can be partially substituted for Y\({}^{3+}\) in quantities up to nearly 0.3 calcium ions per formula unit,[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] introducing one additional carrier (hole) per substituted ion. In this case, the dopant ion sits directly in the active superconducting region (planes) and results in a 10 K reduction in the maximum obtainable \(T_{c}\).[7, 8] Calcium substitutes primarily on the yttrium site because its ionic radius is close to that of yttrium,[3] but there have been reports of partial calcium substitution on the barium site that increases as the calcium content is increased.[8, 9]

The role of calcium doping on the transport properties of bulk YBCO has been widely discussed.[2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13] However, bulk samples consist of a network of randomly oriented grains separated by unoriented, high-resistance grain boundaries which complicate the interpretation of the results. It is, therefore, important to understand the effects of calcium doping on more intrinsic samples such as single crystals or epitaxial thin films.

In addition to obtaining a more fundamental understanding of the role of cation substitution on the intrinsic transport properties of YBCO, calcium-doped YBCO films can be used as a model system to quantify the amount of overdoping expected from small amounts of cation disorder in pure YBCO thin films. It has been proposed that Ba-Y disorder or Ba substitution for Y could account for the higher critical current densities, lower transition temperatures, and expanded \(c\)-axis lattice parameters observed in "fully oxygenated" YBCO films, as compared to bulk samples of the same material.[14, 15, 16, 17, 18] This disorder is thought to result from the nonequilibrium growth of thin films in low oxygen pressures (\(\leq 200\) mTorr),[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] but is not expected to occur during higher-oxygen-pressure bulk synthesis.[19] The substitution of divalent barium for trivalent yttrium should result in films which are overdoped as compared to unsubstituted samples with the same oxygen content.

Recently Feenstra _et al.[17, 18]_ have used transport measurements of the resistivity and \(T_{c}\) to investigate possible cation disorder in films grown in low oxygen partial pressures. In these experiments YBCO films were initially annealed in 1.0 atm O\({}_{2}\) at 550 \({}^{\circ}\)C to establish a fully oxygenated state. Then the \(T_{c}\)'s and conductivities at 100 K were monitored as the films underwent a series of anneals at reduced oxygen partial pressures. Changes in the conductivity relative to that in the fully oxygenated state, \(-\Delta\sigma/\sigma_{0}\), were used to parameterize the oxygen content of the films. The authors found that some films achieved their maximum \(T_{c}\)'s after annealing in reduced oxygen partial pressures, and concluded that this results from additional fixed carriers introduced by Ba-Y disorder. However, the amount of overdoping was not readily quantifiable in these experiments since there was no absolute measure of the oxygen content in the films. In addition, the interpretation of their results requires knowledge of the oxygen content of fully oxygenated films. In Ref. 17 it was implicitly assumed that the oxygen content of fully oxygenated films was unaffected by possible cation disorder, while in Ref. 18 assumptions about the oxygen content were tailored to each class of films in order to explain trends in the experimental results.

In our work we have attempted to improve the measurement of overdoping by establishing an independent measure of the carrier concentration, and by calibrating the amount of overdoping using well-characterized Y1-_x_Ca_Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ films with known amounts of cation substitution. We found that the room-temperature thermopower could be used to determine the carrier concentration in our films using the empirical correlation between thermopower and carrier concentration found by Obertelli _et al._20 However, the substitution of calcium for yttrium was accompanied by a reduction in the equilibrium oxygen concentration of fully oxygenated films, which completely compensated for the additional carriers introduced by the calcium. This shows that the technique used by Feenstra _et al._17,18 does not provide unambiguous evidence of cation substitution in the range of calcium concentration we have investigated. It further suggests that recent reports about the overdoping of Y1-_x_Ca_Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ thin films do not reflect the equilibrium oxygen stoichiometry.12,12-23

A brief outline of this paper is as follows. We will first describe the sample fabrication and experimental technique. Then we will discuss the experimental results including correlations between \(T_{c}\) and the normal-state conductivity, and between \(T_{c}\) and the thermopower. We will show that the room-temperature thermopower gives a much better measure of the carrier concentration than the conductivity, because the thermopower is less sensitive to extrinsic influences, such as grain boundaries, which inevitably contribute to the resistivity of these films. Finally, using a simple model of charge transfer that we believe to be applicable near the region of optimal doping, we will show that most of the additional charge introduced by the substitution of calcium is compensated by oxygen defects, just as has been observed in bulk polycrystalline samples.1,3,6 The consistent explanation of our results with that observed in bulk helps support the use of thermopower as a measure of the planar hole concentration.

## II Experimental Procedure

### Film preparation

Epitaxial thin films of Y1-_x_Ca_x_Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ were grown _in situ_ by off-axis sputtering from composite targets having calcium concentrations of \(x\) = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3. The films were deposited onto 13 x 6 mm2 LaAlO3 substrates at a deposition temperature of 790 degC in a mixture of 120 mTorr Ar and 80 mTorr O2 using an rf power of 100 W. Following deposition, the chamber was backfilled with oxygen, and the heater was shut off to allow the films to cool over a period of about 1 h. The resulting films were epitaxial with the \(c\) axis perpendicular to the substrate and were from 75-175 nm thick. Further details of the deposition system and procedure can be found in Ref. 24.

In contrast to pure YBCO films which were cooled in 300-500 Torr of oxygen, calcium-substituted films were cooled in reduced oxygen pressures of 5-20 Torr in order to achieve as-deposited \(T_{c}\)'s near the bulk values of 80-85 K.7,8 Calcium-doped films that were cooled in higher oxygen pressures had reduced \(T_{c}\)'s of from 45 to 65 K, suggestive of overdoping. However, the \(T_{c}\)'s of these films could not be increased by more than about 7 K by subsequent anneals, suggesting that they had additional defects or disorder. Because of this, only films cooled in reduced-oxygen partial pressures were used in this study.

### Annealing

The films were annealed at atmospheric pressure in mixtures of 1%-100% oxygen in flowing argon at 480-500 degC for 2-4 h. The partial pressure of oxygen in the O2/Ar mixture was determined to within +-5% of the measured value and was continuously monitored by a commercial zirconia-cell oxygen sensor.25 The annealing conditions were chosen to ensure that the films reached their equilibrium oxygen content while maximizing the amount of oxygen which could be incorporated at the highest oxygen pressure. A series of successively longer anneals on similar films were used to establish that the annealing time was sufficient to ensure an equilibrium oxygen content. The required annealing time is very sensitive to the microstructure of the film because oxygen diffusion along the _a_-_b_ plane is many orders of magnitude faster than along the \(c\) direction.26-28 The relatively long annealing times required suggests a high degree of _c_-axis texturing and a low density of grain boundaries in these films.

The oxygen content of the films could be changed in a completely reversible manner in all but the \(x\) = 0.3 sample. The films with \(x\) < 0.3 were cycled from superconducting to insulating and back to superconducting by varying the oxygen content, and recovered to within better than 10% of their original resistivities and to within 0.8 K of their original \(T_{c}\)'s. The film with \(x\) = 0.3 did not become insulating after the lowest \(P_{{\rm O}_{2}}\) anneal, and \(T_{c}\) returned to a value 4.9 K _higher_ than its original value of 73.9 K. The resistivity of this sample increased by 37% after cycling, suggesting that it was initially overdoped by some mechanism which was irreversible with annealing. The amount of overdoping was estimated to be 0.015 holes per plane based on thermopower measurements. The irreversible behavior of the \(x\) = 0.3 film is not likely to have resulted from a lower chain oxygen mobility, because this film had a more heterogeneous microstructure than the others, and because the addition of calcium to bulk YBCO has been shown to increase the oxygen diffusion rate by more than a factor of 10 at 500 degC.29  

### Transport measurements

The thermopower was measured in vacuum with respect to copper, and was confirmed to have an absolute accuracy of about 7% using a 99.999%-pure Pb standard. We used the room-temperature value of 2.07 \(\mu\)V/K for the thermopower of copper for all measurements, which is the value determined by Cusack and Kendall[30] corrected for the new absolute scale of Roberts.[31] The thermopower was measured using a differential technique by clamping one end of the sample to a large copper block which served as a heat reservoir, and the other to a smaller copper block to which was attached a resistive heater. The temperature gradient was measured by a 0.13 mm diam differential Chromel-Alumel (type K) thermocouple whose ends were embedded in either block. Evaporated silver contacts across the entire width of the sample at either end of the film ensured uniform, low thermal and electrical resistance contacts to the copper blocks. All residual silver paste was removed from the back side of the samples in order to ensure a uniform temperature gradient across the entire thickness of the substrate. The thermocouple and sample voltages were measured to within \(\pm 20\) nV by Keithley 182 nanovoltmeters, and \(\Delta V\) was verified to be proportional to the \(\Delta T\) for 4-5 \(\Delta T\)'s up to \(\Delta T\approx 2\) K for each measurement.

The resistivity was measured using a conventional four-point technique with a calibrated Si diode as the thermometer. All films were patterned into four-point resistance bridges 460 \(\mu\)m wide by 7.1 mm long. The sample thickness was determined by a commercial profilometer to within \(\pm 10\) nm for samples with \(x=0\) and 0.1, and to within \(\pm 20\) nm for samples with \(x=0.2\) and 0.3. The temperature measurement was accurate to within \(\pm 0.1\) K. All reported values of the superconducting transition temperature in this paper refer to the "\(R=0\)" \(T_{c}\) which was defined as the point where the resistivity dropped to below 1% of its value at 100 K.

## III Results

### Film properties

The as-deposited films had excellent transport properties with \(T_{c}\)'s of up to 89 K (for \(x=0\)) and \(\rho(T)\)'s which extrapolated through \(\rho=0\) at \(T=0\). These films were then annealed for 2 h at 480 \({}^{\circ}\)C in 1.0 atm O\({}_{2}\) to establish the fully oxygenated state. After the initial anneal the room-temperature resistivities increased slightly and the extrapolated \(T=0\) intercepts became approximately 10% of the room-temperature resistivity for all films. The \(T_{c}\) of the undoped film was not changed by the initial anneal, but the \(T_{c}\)'s of the calcium doped films increased by 2-4 K.

Figure 1 shows the resistive transitions of the films following the initial anneal. The resistivity of the undoped film is about twice that typical of the highest-quality single crystals,[32, 33, 34] but is still significantly lower than those for bulk, polycrystalline samples.[35, 36, 37] The high resistivity of the \(x=0\) film results partly from twin boundary scattering and partly from underdoping due to the slight oxygen deficiency expected for an annealing temperature of 480 \({}^{\circ}\)C.[38] The room-temperature resistivities (listed in Table 1) decrease with increasing calcium content except for the film with \(x=0.3\). This is consistent with the increased carrier concentration in calcium-doped films. However, as will be quantified later, the decrease in resistivity is not nearly as much as would be expected for the amount of calcium doping if one assumes that the holes from the calcium ions are all transferred to the copper oxide planes.

The higher resistivity for the \(x=0.3\) sample could be explained by increased grain boundary resistance in this film. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) photos of this film reveal the existence of a needle-shaped impurity phase. This impurity phase is not observed in SEM photos of the other films, suggesting that it results from exceeding the solubility limit of Ca in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\). The solubility limit in bulk Y\({}_{1-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) is between \(x=0.2\) and 0.3, which is consistent with this observation.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] Scanning electron microscopy has been used to look for possible impurity phases because it is more sensitive than x-ray diffraction to the presence of unoriented material. No second phase peaks were observed in any of the x-ray diffraction \(\theta\)-2\(\theta\) scans of these films. The c-axis lattice parameter for all initially annealed films was \(11.71\pm 0.02\) A regardless of the calcium content. The expanded \(c\)-axis lattice parameters are typical of fully oxygenated YBCO films grown under similar conditions.[15, 16, 24, 39]

Table 1 summarizes the properties of all samples studied. The quantities (\(\rho_{0}\)) and (\(T_{c}^{0}\)) refer to the resistivities and transition temperatures, respectively, of the "initially annealed" films. Table 1 also lists the initial oxygen content of the films (\(y_{0}\)) determined by the procedure described in Sec. III.4. The transition temperature and room-temperature conductivity of the films at "optimal doping" is listed as \(T_{c}^{\star}\) and \(\sigma^{\star}\), respectively. These values were determined from the correlation between conductivity and \(T_{c}\) as described in the following section.

Figure 1: Resistive transitions of Y\({}_{1-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) films after an initial anneal in 1.0 atm O\({}_{2}\) for 2 h at 480 \({}^{\circ}\)C for \(x=0.0\) (solid line), 0.1 (dashed line), 0.2 (dotted line), and 0.3 (dot-dashed line).

 The transition temperatures of initially annealed films decrease with increasing calcium content. This decrease could be caused by either a deviation of the carrier concentration from the optimal value, or by additional scattering introduced by the calcium impurities. In bulk polycrystalline samples, the maximum \(T_{c}\) obtainable is reduced to slightly over 80 K for \(x\geq 0.05\). [7, 8] Thus, there are at least two factors which influence \(T_{c}\): doping and disorder. The conventional way to separate these factors is to determine the maximum \(T_{c}\) as a function of oxygen content using a series of anneals in various partial pressures of oxygen as has been done in this study. We will later demonstrate that measurement of the room-temperature thermopower provides a much simpler procedure for separating these effects.

### Conductivity

We now discuss the correlation between the superconducting transition temperature and the normal-state conductivity.

In all cuprate superconductors the transition temperature has been found to go through a maximum with increasing carrier concentration. [40, 41, 42, 43, 44] Although the exact functional form of \(T_{c}(p)\) is still disputed, [43, 44] many authors have approximated \(T_{c}(p)\) as being parabolic about \(p^{\star}\approx 0.16\) holes per CuO plane. [42, 43, 45, 46, 47] This can always be done for any symmetric peak since a parabola is the first term in the Taylor expansion about the maximum. Let us write

\[\frac{T_{c}(p)}{T_{c}^{\star}}=1-\left(\frac{p^{\star}-p}{p^{\star}-p_{1}} \right)^{2}+{\cal O}(p^{\star}-p)^{4}\ ,\] (1)

where \(p_{1}\) is the carrier concentration which causes \(T_{c}\) to go to zero. The normal-state conductivity (\(\sigma\)) has been found to be nearly linear with carrier concentration [48] in La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) for hole concentrations greater than some mobility threshold, \(p_{c}\), giving

\[\sigma=\mu e(p-p_{c}).\] (2)

If we can extend these results to the case of YBCO and neglect corrections of order \((p^{\star}-p)^{4}\), then we expect that \(T_{c}\) should be parabolic in \(\sigma\).

Figure 2 shows \(T_{c}\) versus the room-temperature conductivity \(\sigma_{295\mbox{ K}}\) for all films with varying oxygen contents. For each film \(T_{c}\) vs \(\sigma_{295\mbox{ K}}\) can be well fit by a parabola with a maximum at \(\sigma=\sigma^{\star}\) and \(T_{c}=T_{c}^{\star}\). The values for \(\sigma^{\star}\) and \(T_{c}^{\star}\) are given in Table 1 for all films studied. Note that \(T_{c}^{\star}\) and \(\sigma^{\star}\) are different from \(T_{c}^{0}\) and \(1/\rho_{0}\), showing that none of the films were "optimally doped" after the initial anneal in pure oxygen. Also note that none of the samples get very far into the "overdoped" regime where \(T_{c}\) begins to decrease with increasing conductivity. This is an effect which is further confirmed by thermopower measurements in Sec. III.3. Although our data are consistent with a parabolic \(T_{c}(\sigma)\), we cannot rule out the possible existence of higher-order terms.

If we assume the conductivity as a function of doping is given by the modified Drude form in Eq. (2), then we can determine \(p\) from

\[\frac{\sigma^{\star}-\sigma}{\sigma^{\star}}=\frac{p^{\star}-p}{p^{\star}-p_{ c}}\ ,\] (3)

where \(p^{\star}\) is the hole doping at optimal \(T_{c}\). Note that this expression requires knowledge of the additional parameter \(p_{c}\) to determine \(\delta p/p^{\star}\) as in Refs. [17] and [18].

The films have different \(T_{c}(\sigma)\) relations presumably because of different characteristic scattering times (\(\tau\)) in the Drude form for \(\sigma\). The scattering time would be expected to be smaller in films with more calcium or other disorder-induced scattering centers. This is consistent with the general trend of decreasing \(\sigma^{\star}\) with increasing \(x\) as seen in Table 1. However, \(\sigma^{\star}\) can also be affected by extrinsic factors such as grain boundary resistances and errors in the thickness determination. This might explain the increase in \(\sigma^{\star}\) of the \(x=0.2\) film since the relative error in the thickness of this very thin film is nearly \(\pm 25\)%.

It is possible to scale all \(T_{c}\) vs \(\sigma\) data onto a single parabola for all films except for the sample with \(x=0.3\). If we combine Eqs. (1) and (3) and neglect the higher-order terms, we find

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} Ca & \(d\) & \(\rho_{0}(300\mbox{ K})\) & \(T_{c}\) & \(y_{0}\) & \(\sigma^{\star}\) & \(T_{c}^{\star}\) \\  & (nm) & (\(\mu\Omega\) cm) & (K) & (\(\Omega^{-1}\) cm\({}^{-1}\)) & (K) \\ \hline
0 & 165 & 450 & 88.7 & 6.98 & 2350 & 88.7 \\
0.1 & 175 & 390 & 83.3 & 6.96 & 225  \[\frac{T_{c}(\sigma)}{T_{c}^{*}}\approx 1-\eta^{2}\Biggl{(}\frac{\sigma}{\sigma^{*} }-1\Biggr{)}^{2}\ ,\] (4)

where \(\eta\equiv(p^{*}-p_{c})/(p^{*}-p_{1})\). The scaled \(T_{c}(\sigma)\) curves give \(\eta=1.14\pm 0.01\) for the samples with \(x\leq 0.2\). The fact that the curves can be scaled shows that there are sample-independent values of \(p^{*}\), \(p_{c}\), and \(p_{1}\) which are capable of representing the \(T_{c}(p)\) and \(\sigma(p)\) relations. The fact that \(\eta\) is slightly larger than 1 shows that \(T_{c}\) drops to zero just before localization sets in. This behavior is also observed in La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\).[49, 50] One might expect \(T_{c}\) to be suppressed by localization right at the metal-insulator transition. This scenario would still be consistent with our observation of residual conductivity at \(T_{c}=0\) because we have used the room-temperature value of \(\sigma\) which is nonzero even when the sample is an insulator at \(T=0\). The lack of ability to scale the \(x=0.3\) sample is consistent with the existence of a significant extrinsic contribution to the resistivity in this film.

While it does appear possible to use the conductivity to determine the carrier concentration in thin films, there are a number of difficulties which complicate its use. First, one needs to assume values for \(p^{*}\) and \(p_{c}\). Second, the inability to scale the \(T_{c}\) vs \(\sigma\) data on the \(x=0.3\) sample provides evidence that not all films behave the same due to possible extrinsic contributions to the conductivity. Finally, the most serious drawback is that one has to determine \(\sigma^{*}\) through an exhaustive series of anneals before being able to employ this technique.

### Thermopower

Because of drawbacks in the interpretation of the conductivity, we set out to evaluate the thermopower as a technique to determine the carrier concentration in our films.

Figure 3 shows the correlation between the measured room-temperature thermopower \(S_{295\ {\rm K}}\) and the superconducting transition temperature normalized to its sample-dependent maximum, \(T_{c}^{*}\). The solid symbols are our data on calcium-doped YBCO thin films, while the crosses are the data from Obertelli _et al.[20]_ The thermopower is plotted against both logarithmic and linear scales on the left and right axes, respectively. This is done because for underdoped samples the thermopower is large and positive and increases rapidly as \(T_{c}/T_{c}^{*}\) decreases, while for overdoped samples the thermopower has much smaller magnitude and changes sign in the vicinity of the optimal \(T_{c}\). The superconducting transition temperature is plotted on the \(x\) axis as \(\sqrt{1-T_{c}/T_{c}^{*}}\) which should be linear in \(p\) if

\[T_{c}/T_{c}^{*}=1-\alpha(p-p^{*})^{2}.\] (5)

For our films \(T_{c}^{*}\) was determined from the peaks of the parabolic fits to the conductivity measurements listed in Table 1. The data of Obertelli _et al.[20]_ was converted from \(S(p)\) to \(S(T_{c}/T_{c}^{*})\) using Eq. (5) with \(\alpha=82.6\) and \(p^{*}=0.16\) [Eq. (1) of Ref. 20]. This was done to put all the data on the same scale for comparison, and results in the unphysical values of \(\sqrt{1-T_{c}/T_{c}^{*}}\) for the extremely underdoped films in Fig. 3.

The data for our films follow the same universal curve as that of Obertelli _et al.[20]_ despite the additional disorder introduced by the calcium substitution. This shows that the mechanism responsible for the striking correlation between \(S_{295\ {\rm K}}\) and \(T_{c}/T_{c}^{*}\) is not influenced by the additional disorder, even though \(T_{c}^{*}\) is. It also means that a single measurement of \(T_{c}\) and \(S_{295\ {\rm K}}\) can be used to determine \(T_{c}^{*}\) without requiring a series of oxygenating anneals. This observation may be extremely useful in determining whether a film with a reduced \(T_{c}\) is merely underdoped or is defective in some other way.

For higher thermopowers (lower doping) the data for our films begins to systematically deviate to values about 30% lower than those seen by Obertelli _et al.[20]_ This deviation occurs for all films regardless of the calcium content, suggesting a systematic discrepancy that is not related to the calcium. This discrepancy is not significantly larger than the scatter in the data of Obertelli _et al._,[20] and actually improves the extrapolation of the highest-thermopower data into the lower-thermopower regime. Alternatively, the discrepancy could result from an error of about 0.02 holes per CuO plane in converting the data of Obertelli _et al.[20]_ from \(S(p)\) to \(S(T_{c})\). In Ref. 20, \(p\) was determined by bond valence sums[40, 51] for most samples in the low-doping regime, and so the discrepancy could also result from a small error in the determination of \(p\).

The fact that the thermopower versus \(T_{c}\) correlation holds for our films also suggests that \(S_{295\ {\rm K}}\) is measuring something intrinsic to the material. One might expect

Figure 3: Room-temperature absolute thermopower on logarithmic (left axis) and linear (right axis) scales as a function of normalized transition temperature for samples with Ca = 0.0 (circle), 0.1 (square), 0.2 (triangle), and 0.3 (diamond). The functional form of the \(x\) axis has been chosen to be linear in hole concentration (\(p\)) if \(T_{c}\) is parabolic in \(p\). Crosses are data from Ref. 20.

  the thermopower to be less sensitive than the conductivity to extrinsic defects, such as grain boundaries, because the temperature gradient is supported by phonons and is locked to the gradient across the substrate, whereas the electric field gradient can be appreciable across the narrow, but relatively poorly conducting grain boundaries. Thus, the thermopower is a much more intrinsic measurement than the conductivity, making it more directly applicable to evaluating the carrier concentration in the films.

If we use the calibration of Obertelli _et al._[20] of \(p(S_{295~{}\rm K})\), we can plot \(T_{c}/T_{c}^{*}\) as a function of \(p\) for the calcium-doped films. This plot is shown in Fig. 4. The data for all films lie on a single parabola with maximum \(T_{c}/T_{c}^{*}\) at \(p=p^{*}=0.167\). Although this is not surprising given the method in which \(p\) was determined, Fig. 4 provides another way of expressing the fact that the empirical correlation between \(S_{295~{}\rm K}\) and \(T_{c}/T_{c}^{*}\) holds for all films regardless of the suppression of \(T_{c}^{*}\) from the additional disorder introduced by calcium doping.

### Oxygen content

The results of Fig. 4 suggest a quantitative discrepancy between the amount of calcium doping and the increase in carrier concentration. Because the calcium is substituted directly between the copper oxide planes, the excess holes should be directly transferred to the planes yielding \(p(x)=p(x=0)+x/2\). However, we find that the maximum hole concentration in calcium-doped films does not greatly exceed that of the undoped samples. With \(x=0.3\) the doping level in films with oxygen \(y\approx 7.0\) should be nearly \(p=0.17+0.15=0.32\). This is far less than observed. Even the conductivity (Fig. 2) shows far less overdoping; based on Eq. (3), the conductivity, would be expected to nearly double for this level of carrier concentration. The thermopower, normal-state conductivity, and transition temperatures all indicate quantitatively less overdoping than would be expected for any of the calcium-substituted films.

We can quantitatively explain the lack of overdoping in our Y\({}_{1-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) films by a compensation effect in which the additional carriers introduced by calcium doping are almost completely compensated by the creation of oxygen vacancies. Consider the fully oxygenated films which were initially annealed in 1.0 atm O\({}_{2}\). We model the system near equilibrium as one in which all of the holes from added calcium go onto the copper oxide planes, and all of the holes removed by loss of chain oxygens are removed directly from the planes. This results in an expression relating the oxygen deficiency \(\delta\), the calcium doping \(x\), and the planar hole concentration \(p\) by

\[p=p^{*}+x/2-(\delta-\delta_{0})\ ,\] (6)

where \(p^{*}=0.167\) is the planar hole concentration at optimal doping determined in Fig. 4. The quantity \((\delta-\delta_{0})\) in expression (6) is the oxygen deficiency relative to that of a pure YBCO film at optimal doping. Equation (6) simply says that for a calcium-free film (\(x=0\)) the hole concentration per plane is \(p^{*}\) at optimal doping (\(\delta=\delta_{0}\)). The hole concentration decreases by 1 hole per plane for every oxygen atom removed and increases by 1/2 hole per plane for every Ca\({}^{2+}\) substituted for a Y\({}^{3+}\).

Figure 5 shows the equilibrium oxygen content (\(y=7.00-\delta\)) as a function of calcium doping for all fully oxygenated films. Also included in Fig. 5 is the data of Gledel _et al._[6] on the oxygen content of bulk Y\({}_{1-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) powders that were annealed in 1.0 atm oxygen. Here we have chosen \(\delta_{0}=0\) as the equilibrium oxygen content of calcium-free YBCO at optimal carrier doping. This choice is merely convenient for comparing our results to the bulk data, and does not affect the validity of our argument.

[20]) for \(p\). All curves fall onto a single parabola with optimal hole concentration of \(p^{*}=0.167\).

Figure 5: Equilibrium oxygen content (\(y\)) as a function of calcium content for Y\({}_{1-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) films annealed in 1.0 atm O\({}_{2}\) at 480 °C. For these films (squares) the extra holes introduced by calcium substitution is almost completely compensated by oxygen defects just as is seen in bulk (circles) (Ref. [6]).

  The fixed charge introduced by calcium doping is completely compensated by oxygen defects in both the bulk and the films. This phenomenon is absolutely typical of oxides where the thermodynamics is driven by equilibrium ionic valences rather than by total oxygen content. The phenomenon is most familiar in highly ionic solids such as yttrium-stabilized zirconia where the well-defined valences of Y and Zr do not confuse the issue. Substitution of Y\({}^{3+}\) for Zr\({}^{4+}\) results in the creation of oxygen vacancies to compensate for the change in ionic charge. In Y\({}_{1-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\), the variable valence of copper has to be reconciled with the variable oxygen content of the material. The correct way to think of it is that the minimization of thermodynamic free energy (enthalpy) requires a particular copper valence which is dependent, in part, on the crystal structure of the material. The oxygen content is therefore adjusted to create the appropriate copper valence at the given temperature and oxygen pressure. Our results show that when calcium is partially substituted for yttrium, the equilibrium average copper valence for a given temperature and oxygen pressure is unchanged to first order. The transition temperature is slightly reduced by the disorder from the calcium located in between the actively conducting copper oxide planes, but there is no significant change in equilibrium copper valence.

Exactly the same results of compensation of cation charge by oxygen vacancies have also been observed in bulk Y\({}_{1-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) by many other researchers. [1, 3, 6, 52] In those reports the oxygen content was determined by iodometric titration, [1, 52] thermogravimetricy, [3, 6, 52] and neutron diffraction, [3] all of which confirm the loss of oxygen upon substitution of calcium. The fact that we see the same results in thin films validates our technique of using the thermopower to determine the carrier concentration and hence the oxygen content.

There have been several claims of overdoping in Y\({}_{1-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) thin films. [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73,  quent anneals in pure oxygen at 480 degC for 2 h. Annealing these films again in 0.035 atm O2 reduced the \(T_{c}\)'s of the \(x=0.1\) and \(x=0.2\) films to 12.8 K and 41.7 K, respectively, although the \(T_{c}\) of the \(x=0.3\) sample remained nearly unchanged. Even substituted YBCO films had an excess carrier concentration immediately after deposition. Thermopower and resistivity measurements routinely showed that as-deposited YBCO thin films were very slightly overdoped, but after the films were annealed in pure oxygen they became slightly underdoped.

These observations are impossible to explain by a single oxygen diffusion mechanism because the films spend more time at lower temperatures during \(ex\,situ\) annealing and therefore should contain more oxygen after annealing. Nor can the observations be explained by oxygen ordering, because the films were cooled more slowly after \(ex\,situ\) anneals and therefore should have greater ordering and hence more chain-to-plane charge transfer.

The simplest explanation is the existence of an additional defect structure that results in nonequilibrium overdoping and is frozen in during deposition or during high-temperature annealing in high partial pressures of oxygen. This defect structure might also explain the irreversible annealing behavior of the \(x=0.3\) sample and the reduced \(T_{c}\)'s of calcium-substituted films cooled in high partial pressures of oxygen. The irreversibility comes from the fact that the defect structure can be gradually eliminated by prolonged annealing at temperatures used for reversible oxygenation. We note that the \(x=0.3\) sample exhibited an increased \(T_{c}^{*}\) after undergoing six low-temperature anneals for a total of 15 h at 480 degC.

The fact that such an effect is only seen in thin films suggests that either it occurs during kinetically limited growth or that it is only a "surface effect" in bulk samples. The fact that the slight overdoping is not compensated indicates that the responsible mechanism must also disrupt the equilibrium charge balance. Since the charge balance is determined by the copper valence, which is determined in part by structural considerations, we believe that the nonequilibrium overdoping mechanism must involve a distortion of the lattice.

Because nonequilibrium overdoping in our calcium-substituted films was so dramatically affected by the oxygen pressure during cooling, we believe there are two primary candidates for its origin: either the intercalation of excess oxygen, perhaps in molecular form, within the unit cell or significant amounts of cation disorder driven by the imbalance of cation charges in the presence of high oxygen pressures.

The scenario of excess oxygen incorporation is most appealing to us. Manthiram _et al._1 have proposed the formation of molecular oxygen (peroxides) in the basal plane to explain the oxygenation of lanthanum-doped YBCO where equilibrium oxygen contents of \(y>7.00\) would be expected to compensate for the carriers lost to the La substitution. Peroxides would be expected to have a much slower diffusion rate than atomic oxygen because of their larger size. Therefore, they could only be incorporated into very thin films at relatively high substrate temperatures, perhaps above the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition. Films with greater amounts of calcium could incorporate more peroxides because of the tremendous enhancement of oxygen mobility observed for calcium-substituted YBCO.29 While the incorporation of peroxides could explain these anomalies, the issue needs to be resolved by further study.

## V Conclusions

We have systematically studied the variations of normal-state thermopower and conductivity with oxygen content in high-quality, epitaxial thin films of Y1-aCaBa2Cu3O7-\(\delta\) with \(0\leq x\leq 0.3\). The superconducting transition temperature was found to vary parabolically with conductivity for all films studied with a universal scaling behavior for single-phase samples. This behavior of \(T_{c}(\sigma)\) is consistent with a linear dependence of the conductivity on carrier concentration with a scattering rate that increases with increasing amounts of calcium.
