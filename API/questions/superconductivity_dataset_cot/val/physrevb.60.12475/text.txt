###### Abstract

We present the resistively determined upper critical field \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\) and the irreversibility lines \(H_{int}^{\rho}(T)\) of various high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates, deduced from measurements in 61-T pulsed magnetic fields applied parallel to the \(c\) axis. The _shape_ of both \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\) and \(H_{int}^{\rho}(T)\) depends monotonically on the anisotropy of the material and none of the samples show saturation of \(H^{\rho}(T)\) at low temperatures. The anomalous positive curvature \(d^{2}H^{\rho}/dT^{2}\)\(>\)0 is the strongest in materials with the largest normal state anisotropy, regardless of whether anisotropy is varied by changing the carrier concentration or by comparing a variety of optimally doped compounds.

The anisotropy of the high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates, coupled with their short coherence lengths, gives rise to a complex magnetic phase diagram, featuring a vortex liquid state located between the vortex solid and the normal state.[1, 2, 3] In particular, in the high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates, the vortex lattice can melt at temperatures well below the onset of short-range superconducting order occurring at the upper critical magnetic field \(H_{c2}\). In a fixed temperature experiment, this is evidenced by the onset of resistivity due to vortex motion well below the magnetic field at which the normal-state resistivity is restored, defined as the resistively determined upper critical magnetic field \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\). Resistivity measurements on overdoped Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{2}\) (Tl-2201) (Ref. [4]) and overdoped Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{y}\) (Bi-2201) (Ref. [5]) have found a strong upward curvature in \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\) with no evidence of saturation at low temperatures. Such an \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\) curve contrasts strongly with the conventional Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory for superconductors with weak electron-phonon coupling,[6] in which \(H_{c2}(T)\) exhibits negative curvature and saturates at low temperatures. Similarly anomalous \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\) curves have been discussed in connection with other anisotropic superconductors, such as the organic superconductors.[7] However, due to the extremely large upper critical fields, studies of the resistive transition in the cuprates have been largely limited to samples in which \(T_{c}\) and \(H_{c2}\) are greatly suppressed,[8] either in strongly underdoped[9] or overdoped samples,[4, 5] in deliberately impurity-doped samples,[10] or in the electron-doped cuprates.[11]

In addition to the unusual "'shape" of the \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\) curves, a reexamination of the origin and meaning of the resistive transition in the cuprates is fueled, in part, by specific heat,[12] Raman spectroscopy,[13] and magnetization[14] measurements which indicate that the onset of local superconducting order [generally interpreted as the mean-field \(H_{c2}(T)\)] in Tl-2201 occurs at magnetic fields well above \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\). At this mean-field \(H_{c2}(T)\), no feature is observed in the measured resistivity. Perhaps more surprisingly, the experimental evidence for this mean-field \(H_{c2}(T)\), in both the specific heat and Raman experiments, is anomalously and dramatically suppressed by magnetic fields of only a few T. Thus, \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\) does not seem to correspond to the mean-field \(H_{c2}(T)\), which might suggest that it corresponds to the melting of the vortex lattice. The difficulty with this interpretation of \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\) is that it is unclear why the melted vortex state should be (or can be) indistinguishable in resistivity measurements from the normal state. More specifically, if \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\) corresponds to the irreversibility line, then the magnetic phase diagram (at least for Tl-2201 and Bi-2201) contains an unusual vortex liquid state whose resistivity apparently equals the normal-state resistivity and exhibits no substantial magnetic-field or temperature dependence.[4, 5] In light of the debate about the magnetic phase diagram and the interpretation of \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\) in the cuprates, a systematic study of \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\), particularly in optimally doped compounds, is clearly desirable.

In this paper, we present resistivity measurements in 61-T pulsed magnetic fields which determine \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\) for La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) (LSCO) of various carrier concentrations \(x\). In addition to LSCO, we present \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\) data for nearly optimally doped Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{y}\) (Bi-2212) and YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) (YBCO). We find that the "'shape" of the \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\) changes monotonically with the anisotropy of the normal state of the sample, becoming more conventional as the anisotropy gets smaller. The magnitude of the positive curvature in \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\), along with the steep slope of \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\) at the lowest experimental temperature, are the greatest in the most anisotropic compounds.

  The LSCO crystals, grown by the traveling-solvent floating-zone method by the University of Tokyo groups, have been previously studied in pulsed magnetic fields;[15] the samples reported here with Sr concentrations \(x\!=\!0.08\) and 0.17 are grown by the Kishio group and those with \(x\!=\!0.15\) are grown by the Uchida group. The Bi-2212 crystals, grown by the Kishio group using the floating-zone method, are heat treated in sealed quartz tubes to tune to the near-optimum doping. Finally, the YBCO crystals are grown at Bell Laboratories by a flux method in zirconia crucibles and annealed in sealed quartz tubes to tune the oxygen content to optimal doping. The resistivity of each sample was measured at a given fixed temperature during the magnetic field pulse using a \(\sim\!100\) kHz lockin technique.[15, 16] No significant eddy current heating resulted from the time-varying magnetic field. To avoid additional dissipation due to vortex depinning in response to an applied Lorenz force, the current was applied parallel to the magnetic field (along the \(c\) axis), except in the case of the YBCO crystal, whose shape and the relatively small electrical anisotropy precluded this geometry.

Figure 1(a) shows a representative set of raw experimental traces, the \(c\)-axis resistivity \(\rho_{c}\) vs \(H\) of LSCO (\(x\!=\!0.15\)) at various temperatures. The onset field \(H_{\rm onset}\) is defined as the magnetic field at which the resistivity first is detected to deviate from zero in the \(\rho\) vs \(H\) plot. This definition is our best determination of the irreversibility line, given the limited sensitivity of the pulsed-field data. To characterize the rest of the resistive transition in the \(H\) vs \(T\) plane, we determine those magnetic fields at which the resistivity equals 10, 50, 80, and 90 % of the "normal-state" resistivity, denoted \(H10\), \(H50\), \(H80\), and \(H90\), respectively [arrows in Fig. 1(a)]. In traditional superconductors, \(H50\) is often associated with the mean-field upper critical field \(H_{c2}\); however, given the uncertain interpretation of the resistive transition in the cuprates, we make no _a priori_ determination of \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\) from the data. [We do note, in passing, that \(H80(T)\) is comparable to one common assignment of \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\): the intersection of two straight line extrapolations from the normal state resistivity and the steepest slope in the transition region.]

At the lowest temperatures, as Fig. 1(a) illustrates, even 61 T can be insufficient to recover the normal state. In this regime, \(H_{\rm onset}\) remains unambiguous, but the uncertainties in determining \(H10\), \(H50\), \(H80\), and \(H90\) necessarily increase. In this regime, we extrapolate the normal state resistivity to those lower temperatures at which it cannot be measured directly. For the data of Fig. 1(a), this is relatively straightforward since the low-temperature normal-state resistivity in underdoped LSCO obeys a log(1/\(T\)) divergence;[17] for example, we estimate the normal-state resistivity at 1.25 K to be 0.135 \(\Omega\) cm. The resulting errors in \(H10\), etc., are estimated to be about a few T even at the lowest temperatures. For LSCO (\(x\!=\!0.08\)), as shown in Fig. 1(b), no extrapolation is required and thus the errors in \(H10\), etc., are rather small, less than 2 T.

Figure 2(a) shows the contours of the resistive transition of LSCO (\(x\!=\!0.15\)) in the \(H\) vs \(T\) plane, as determined from the data of Fig. 1(a). Representative error bars are attached to the data. Note that the midpoint of the transition, \(H50\), shows a conventional linear temperature dependence from \(T_{c}\) down to \(T\!\!=\!0.5T_{c}\) ; however, it exhibits a steep rise at low temperatures below \(\sim\!10\) K, \(T\!\!\simeq\!0.25\)\(T_{c}\) . Note also that all of the curves exhibit this sharp rise, which persists to the lowest experimental temperature (\(T\!\!=\!1.25\) K\(\simeq\!0.03\)\(T_{c}\)). Thus, regardless of the precise determination of \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\) from the \(\rho_{c}\) vs \(H\) curves in Fig. 1(a), \(H_{c2}^{\rho}\) in optimally doped LSCO exhibits no evidence of saturation at low temperatures, a particularly unusual feature in common with previously-reported data from overdoped Tl-2201 (Ref. [4]) and overdoped Bi-2201.[5]

Figure 2(b) shows the contours of the resistive transition for underdoped LSCO (\(x\!=\!0.08\)) in the \(H\) vs \(T\) plane, constructed from the data of Fig. 1(b). Compared to LSCO (\(x\!=\!0.15\)), the curves in Fig. 2(b) show even greater upward curvature, extending from \(T_{c}\) down to the lowest experimental temperatures for all curves, including \(H80(T)\) and \(H90(T)\). These data, when coupled with the data for LSCO (\(x\!=\!0.17\)) (shown later), suggest a monotonic dependence in which the magnitude of the upward curvature increases with decreasing carrier concentration. We emphasize that 61 T is sufficient to suppress superconductivity in LSCO (\(x\!=\!0.08\)) and thus all the data points in Fig. 2(b) have rather small error bars. Therefore, even though the raw resistive transition in Fig. 1(b) is much broader compared to the overdoped Tl-2201 (Ref. [4]) or Bi-2201 (Ref. [5]), all the definitions for \(H_{c2}^{\rho}\) are unambiguously indicating an unusual upward curvature of \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\) in this underdoped LSCO.

Figure 1: Selected traces of \(\rho_{c}\) vs \(H\) of (a) optimally doped LSCO (\(x\!=\!0.15\)) and (b) underdoped LSCO (\(x\!=\!0.08\)) at fixed temperatures. The arrows in (a), explicitly labeled for the \(T\!=\!9.9\) K trace, mark the onset, 10, 50, 80, and 90 % points of each resistive transition. Only \(H_{\rm onset}\) and \(H50\) are marked by arrows in (b).

  Figure 3 contains the raw \(R\) vs \(H\) data for three cuprates near optimum doping, Bi-2212, LSCO (\(x\) = 0.17) and YBCO. One may notice that the data for Bi-2212 [Fig. 3(a)] show some linear background before the resistance rapidly increases; we have not identified the cause of this linear background, but we determined \(H_{\rm onset}\) for this sample with the deviation from the linear background. One may also notice that the Bi-2212 data show pronounced negative magnetoresistance in the high-field normal state, particularly at low temperatures.

In Fig. 3, we show the data in resistance, rather than in resistivity, to demonstrate that the noise level of our pulsed-field experiments is not determined by the absolute voltage but changes with the sample impedance; the noise is always about a few percent of the impedance being measured (as long as the impedance is larger than a few tens of m\(\Omega\)). This fact precludes the usage of the usual criteria for the irreversibility field defined by a certain electric-field threshold. This is the reason why we needed to determine the onset field \(H_{\rm onset}\) rather naively with the magnetic field at which the resistivity first is detected to deviate from zero in the \(\rho\) vs \(H\) plot.

In determining the normal-state resistance \(R_{n}\) for the samples shown in Fig. 3, we used a linear extrapolation from higher temperatures; for example, we estimated \(R_{n}\) to be 33 \(\Omega\) at 3.0 K for Bi-2212, 1.08 \(\Omega\) at 1.55 K for LSCO (\(x\) = 0.17), and 14.6 m\(\Omega\) at 50 K for YBCO. One can infer from Fig. 3 that \(R_{n}\) of Bi-2212 and LSCO (\(x\) = 0.17) becomes relatively temperature independent at low temperatures and therefore the errors involved in the estimation of \(R_{n}\) are relatively small compared to that for YBCO. The data in Fig. 3(c) show large positive "magnetoresistance," particularly at lower temperatures, which makes the definition of \(R_{n}\) rather ambiguous. As a result, the estimated errors for \(H10\), etc., are comparatively large for YBCO. These very broad resistive transitions of YBCO suggest that the idea of the "resistive upper critical field" at which the normal-state resistivity is restored might be a questionable concept for some of the high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates.

  clear. Our data clearly indicate that the normal state anisotropy plays a key role, perhaps _the_ key role, in determining the curvature of \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\).

In summary, we characterize the resistive transition for a variety of optimally doped high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates using 61-T pulsed magnetic fields. The anomalous positive curvature of both \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\) and \(H_{\rm irr}^{\rho}(T)\) is strongest in the more anisotropic cuprates. None of the samples studied show saturation of \(H_{c2}^{\rho}(T)\) or \(H_{\rm irr}^{\rho}(T)\) at low temperatures.
