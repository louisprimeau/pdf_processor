###### Abstract

The superconductivity in Fe_{x}Cu_{1-x}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y} superconductors (0.00 \leq x \leq 0.70) is improved by high-pressure (HP) synthesis. The HP samples have higher oxygen content than the ambient pressure (AM) samples. Mossbauer effect studies confirmed that the high-pressure synthesis changes the local structure on the atomic scale. For the HP samples Fe (2) in the CuO_{2} planes has highly symmetric pyramidal-oxygen coordination. The tetragonal coordinated Fe (1) in the CuO_{x} chains disappears and becomes the one having fivefold and sixfold oxygen coordination after the high-pressure synthesis. This suggests that the increase of oxygen content and the change of local structure are important reasons for the improvement of superconductivity in the HP samples.

The synthesis temperature was controlled by the electrical input power imposed on the graphite sleeve. The resultant products were quenched from 1000 ^{\circ}C to room temperature by shutting off the electrical power before releasing the pressure. These products were named HP samples.

### Sample characterization

Both the AM and HP samples were characterized by powder XRD using a MXP18A-HF type diffractometer with CuK_{\alpha} radiation.

The powderx program [23] was used to determine the lattice parameters. The results indicate that all the AM and HP samples of Fe_{x}Cu_{1-x}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y} are of single phase except for the samples with x = 0.80 and the solid solubility limit of Fe in the Fe_{x}Cu_{1-x}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y} system is about 0.80, which is consistent with the results of Tarascon _et al._[5] From the dependence of lattice parameters on Fe content as shown in Fig. 1, it is found that the AM samples become tetragonal at x \approx 0.10, which is consistent with previous reports on the Fe-doped YBCO. [5, 8, 9] The HP samples have smaller lattice parameter c and unit-cell volume than the AM samples, which is related to the increase of oxygen content in the HP samples due to the high-pressure synthesis. This phenomenon has been observed in YBCO synthesized in air [24] or in the high-pressure oxygen [25] and in Fe-doped YSr_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} synthesized in high-pressure oxygen. [18, 20]

Figure 2 shows the typical XRD patterns of AM-(a) and HP-(b) samples of Fe_{0.5}Cu_{0.8}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y}, [21] Structural analysis indicates that they have tetragonal structure belonging to space group P4/_mmm_. The lattice parameters of AM and HP samples are a = 0.3874, c = 1.167 nm and a = 0.3865, c = 1.1598 nm, respectively.

### Measurements of oxygen content

The oxygen contents of the AM and HP samples were measured using iodometric titration. [27] It must be pointed out that there was a small amount of KCl and KClO_{4} in the HP samples due to the addition of KClO_{4} used as an oxidant and the incomplete decomposition during the high-pressure synthesis. To minimize its influence on the titration results, the bulk HP samples were powdered, washed using distilled water and dried below 80 ^{\circ}C before determining the oxygen content. The purified powder was still superconducting as checked by magnetization measurements. The results of iodometric titration indicate that the oxygen contents in both the AM and HP samples increase with increasing Fe content, as shown in Fig. 3. Also one can find that the HP-samples have higher oxygen content than the AM samples. The oxygen content in the AM samples is well consistent with those reported in Refs. [8, 24], and [27].

### Superconductivity

dc magnetic measurements were performed using a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS type). Figure 4 shows _M-T_ curves of the AM-(a) and HP-(b) samples. The dependence of _T__{c} on Fe content for the HP and AM samples is shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that for the AM samples _T__{c} decreases quickly with increasing Fe content and becomes zero at x = 0.4, which is in agreement with the results of Tarascon _et al._[8] For the HP samples, however, with increasing Fe content the decrease of _T__{c} is very slow, indicating that the high-pressure synthesis improves superconductivity.

Figure 6 shows the _R-T_ and _M-T_ curves of the AM and HP samples of Fe_{0.5}Cu_{0.5}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y}. These results indicate that the HP sample has a superconducting transition temperature _T__{c}=80 K. The shielding and Meissner fraction is about 50 and 24 %, respectively, indicating that the HP sample with x = 0.50 has bulk superconductivity. The AM sample has a semiconductorlike behavior in the _R-T_ curve, even after oxygenation at 350 ^{\circ}C for 40 h in flowing oxygen under ambient pressure.

### Annealing experiments

In order to know the stability of oxygen absorbed (HPO) in the lattice due to the high-pressure synthesis and find out the possible reasons for the improvement of superconductivity, two HP samples were selected for annealing experiments at different temperatures.

Two typical HP samples (A) Fe_{0.06}Cu_{0.94}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.25} and (B) Fe_{0.5}Cu_{0.9}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.41} were annealed at 150, 250, 350, 450, 650, and 900 ^{\circ}C for 2 h in air and then quenched to room temperature. The reasons for selecting these two HP samples are that the AM samples of the HP samples (A) and (B) have orthorhombic and tetragonal structure, respectively. On the other hand, the AM sample of (A) is superconducting and that of (B) is an insulator. It is advantageous to distinguish the influence of HPO on structure and superconductivity of samples during the annealing process. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) show the influence of the annealing temperature (T_{o}) on the M-T curves of the annealed HP samples (A) and (B), respectively. Results indicate that the T_{c} of HP sample (B) gradually decreases with increasing T_{a} and becomes zero at T_{a} \approx 450 ^{\circ}C. For the HP sample (A), T_{c} is constant in the annealing temperature range of 150-350 ^{\circ}C, then at 450 ^{\circ}C decreases to 85 K which is as high as T_{c} of its AM sample (see Fig. 8).

On the other hand, the lattice parameters of the two annealed HP samples have also changed regularly with increasing T_{a}. Figure 9 shows the influence of T_{a} on the local XRD patterns (46^{\circ} \approx 2\theta \approx 48^{\circ}) of the two annealed HP samples.

Figure 4: The M-T curves of the AM (a) and HP (b) samples of Fe_{x}Cu_{1-x}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y}.

 The dependence of lattice parameters a, b, and c on T_{a} is shown in Fig. 10. For the HP sample (A), the shift of the diffraction peak of (006) to lower angle is not obvious at 150 ^{\circ}C \leq T_{a} \leq 350 ^{\circ}C. For T_{a} \geq 350 ^{\circ}C, the peak of (006) gradually shifts to lower angle and the peaks of (002) and (200) become apparent. This means that lattice parameter c increases gradually and the HP sample (A) undergoes a tetragonal-orthorhombic structural transition during the annealing process, which can be found in Fig. 9(a). For the HP sample (B), the peak of (006) shifts to lower angle with increasing T_{a} [see Fig. 9(b)], indicating that lattice parameter c increases with increasing T_{a}, as shown in Fig. 10(b). It is well known that in the pure YBCO system, the length of lattice parameter c is inversely proportional to the oxygen content. The more oxygen content the samples have, the shorter the lattice parameter c becomes. Based on this and the change of lattice parameter c during the whole annealing process, it is speculated that with increasing annealing temperature the oxygen content of the HP samples (A) and (B) is gradually released. The release of HPO results in the absence of superconductivity in the HP sample (B) and a decrease of T_{c} in HP sample (A) at T_{a}=450 ^{\circ}C. From these observa

Figure 8: The dependence of T_{c} on T_{a} for the HP samples (A) Fe_{0.06}Cu_{0.094}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.25} and (B) Fe_{0.5}Cu_{0.3}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.41}.

  tions, we suggest that the HPO plays an important role in the improvement of superconductivity in the HP samples. The annealing experiments also indicate that the HPO is different from the oxygen entering the lattice in air under ambient pressure. The latter enters the lattice at 350 - 500 ^{\circ}C.[24]

### F. Mossbauer effect

The Mossbauer technique has been shown [5, 6, 7, 16, 17, 18] to be a powerful tool determining the distribution of Fe between Cu (1) and Cu (2) sites. In order to obtain information on the distribution of Fe between the Cu (1) and Cu (2) sites in the AM and HP samples and to further find out the reasons for the improvement of superconductivity in the HP samples, five samples with different Fe content, one AM sample Fe_{0.5}Cu_{0.5}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.24} and four HP samples Fe_{0.16}Cu_{0.84}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.30}, Fe_{0.32}Cu_{0.68}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.34}, Fe_{0.04}Cu_{0.68}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.40}, and Fe_{0.5}Cu_{0.5}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.41}, were selected for Mossbauer effect studies.

^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectra of samples were recorded by a Wissel System constant acceleration Mossbauer spectrometer with ^{57}Co (Pd) source at room temperature. The velocity was calibrated using \alpha-Fe foil. The values of isomer shift given here were relative to \alpha-Fe at room temperature. A least-squares program was used to fit the spectra with Lorenzian line shapes.

Figures 11 and 12 show the results of Mossbauer effect of the selected AM and HP samples. The spectra can be best fit to four subspectra (A, B, C, and D). The hyperfine parameters of isomer shift (\delta), quadrupole splittings (\Delta), full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) (\Gamma), and site intensity ratio (I_{n}/I) of these four subspectra are summarized in Table 1. A consensus that doublets A, C, and D are ascribed to the Fe located at Cu (1) sites and subspectrum B is related to the Fe located at Cu (2) sites has been obtained.[5, 17, 18, 29] Moreover, the Fe atoms corresponding to doublets A, C, and D have tetragonal, fivefold, and sixfold oxygen coordination,[5, 18, 29] respectively, and the Fe corresponding to subspectrum B has the same pyramidal configuration of oxygen as Cu (2).[5, 17, 18, 29]

Figures 11(1), 11(2) and 11(3) show the Mossbauer spectra of the HP samples (1) Fe_{0.16}Cu_{0.84}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.30}, (2) Fe_{0.32}Cu_{0.68}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.34}, and (3) Fe_{0.4}Cu_{0.68}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.40}, respectively. From the three figures, two main features can be observed. One is that the subspectrum B of the HP samples with x\ll 0.40 is a singlet splitting while subspectrum B is a doublet splitting of the HP sample with x=0.50 [see Fig. 12(2)]. The singlet splitting implies that the oxygen environment about the Fe located in CuO_{2} planes is highly symmetric. The other main feature is that the Mossbauer spectra of HP samples with x=0.16 and 0.32 can be fit well according to three subspectra and doublet D is attributed to the sixfold coordinated Fe in CuO_{x} chains.[29]

Figure 11: (Color online) Room-temperature Mössbauer spectra of the HP samples (1) Fe_{0.16}Cu_{0.84}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.30}, (2) Fe_{0.32}Cu_{0.68}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.34}, and (3) Fe_{0.4}Cu_{0.68}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.40}. The notation (i)n denotes that the Fe occupies Cu(i) site and has n-fold oxygen coordination.

  In order to obviously observe the changes in the local oxygen environment about Fe after the high-pressure synthesis, a comparison between the Mossbauer spectra of the HP samples with x = 0.50 and that of its AM sample is indispensable (see Fig. 12). One can find that the doublet C increases at the expense of the doublet A in going from the AM sample to the HP sample and the doublet A disappears in the spectra of HP sample. This means that for the HP sample with x = 0.50 all the Fe atoms located in CuO_{x} chains have fivefold oxygen coordination, which is similar to the results of YSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Fe_{0.3}O_{7+y} prepared by high-pressure oxygen annealing.[18] From the data listed in Table I, it can be found that for the AM sample with x = 0.50 the sum of integrated intensities of doublets A and C is almost equal to that of doublet C in the spectrum of the HP sample, indicating that the integrated intensities of Fe located in CuO_{x} chains is not changed after the high-pressure synthesis. In the Mossbauer spectroscopy, site-integrated intensities are proportional to site occupancy N if we assume that the recoil-free fraction is same.[30] Thus, for the AM and HP samples, 76% of Fe content occupies Cu (1) sites in CuO_{x} chains and 24% of Fe content occupies Cu (2) sites in CuO_{2} plane. The results of Mossbauer spectroscopy indicate that the high-pressure synthesis does not result in the migration of Fe from CuO_{2} planes to CuO_{x} chains.

From Mossbauer spectra, it can also be determined that the Fe corresponding to doublets A and B have valence of +3 and the Fe associated with doublet C and D is Fe^{4+} species,[18, 29] indicating that the average valence of Fe ion in the HP samples is higher than that in the AM sample.

## III Discussions

The perovskite structure of the Y123 compound has two copper sites Cu(1) in CuO_{x} chains and Cu(2) in CuO_{2} planes. From the results of the neutron and Mossbauer spectra data,[5, 11, 12, 18, 31] it was found that the Fe can occupy two Cu sites and Co only substitutes for Cu(1).[18, 32] Most of the previous studies on the Fe- or Co-doped Y123 system attempted to correlate the decrease of _T_{c}_ with the magnetic pair-breaking effect because of magnetism of Fe^{3+} and Co^{3+} ions.[8, 33]

In recent years, however, the superconductivity was improved and discovered in YSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Fe_{0.3}O_{7+y},[18] FeSr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y},[19] and codoped CoSr_{2}Y_{1-x}Ca_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7+y} compounds[34] synthesized under the high-pressure oxygen synthesis and the high-pressure oxygen annealing enhance _T_{c}_ of YSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Fe_{0.3}O_{7+y}, FeSr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y}, and codoped CoSr_{2}Y_{1-x}Ca_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7+y} compounds? Three explanations were put forward to answer this question as follows. (1) The improvement of superconductivity in the YSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Fe_{0.3}O_{7+y} was attributed to the increases of oxygen content and the trigonal bipyramidal coordinated Fe at Cu (1) site in CuO_{x} chains due to high-pressure oxygen annealing.[18] This explanation is supported by the results of XRD, measurements of oxygen content and Mossbauer effect analysis.[18] (2) For the FeSr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y} superconductor prepared by calcining at 900 ^{\circ}C in air, subsequent annealing at 800 ^{\circ}C in flowing N_{2} and then oxidizing at 350 ^{\circ}C in high-pressure oxygen of 195 atm, superconductivity is induced by both the ordering of Cu and Fe atoms in chains and the increase of oxygen content.[19, 20, 26, 28] (3) The occurrence of superconductivity in the CoSr_{2}Y_{1-x}Ca_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7+y} system was attributed to the presence of the excess holes[34] due to the increase of oxygen content and the substitution of Ca^{2+} for Y^{3+}.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} Sample & x = & Site & \delta (mm/s) & \Delta (mm/s) & \Gamma (mm/s) & _I_{n}/I_ \\ HP & 0.16 & B: & 0.334(6) & & & 0.131(1) & 0.20(1) \\  & & C: & -0.034(6) & 0.972(0) & 0.221(0) & 0.66(3) \\  & & D: & -0.064(8) & 0.281(4) & 0.101(3) & 0.14(2) \\ HP & 0.32 & B: & 0.487(8) & &  From our present work, it was found that the high-pressure synthesis not only increases oxygen content but also modifies the local structure on the atomic scale. For instance, in the Mossbauer spectra of the HP samples with lower Fe content of x <= 0.40 the site B has singlet splitting, suggesting that oxygen environment about Fe(2) has higher symmetry. At the same time, Fe(1) in CuO_x_ chains has fivefold and sixfold oxygen coordination. These changes of the local structure are possibly conducive to the improvement of superconductivity.

In order to understand well the changes of the local structure, one can compare the Mossbauer spectrum of the HP sample with x = 0.5 with that of its AM sample [see Figs. 12(1) and 12(2)]. It is found that the Mossbauer spectrum of the AM sample consists of three subspectra and that of the HP sample only consists of two subspectra. According to the assignments of Fe configuration, one can find that for the HP sample all the Fe(1) atoms in CuO_x_ chains have fivefold oxygen coordination (trigonal bipyramid).[18] The fivefold oxygen coordination has been discussed in YSrSrCu2.Fc0.3O7+-y superconductor synthesized by high-pressure oxygen annealing.[18] It is possible that the trigonal bipyramidal coordinated Fe in the chains improve the coupling between the two adjacent CuO2 planes[18] and is favorable to charge transfer from CuO_x_ chains to CuO2 planes. Therefore, the superconductivity in Fe-doped YBCO is improved after the high-pressure synthesis.

The results of Mossbauer effect indicate that for the sample with x = 0.50 20% of the whole Fe content is located in CuO2 planes and Fe(2) is the Fe3+ species with magnetism. It is worth noting that the T_{c} of the HP sample with x = 0.5 is enhanced up to 80 K, suggesting that the magnetic pairing-breaking effect is not obvious. Since the variation of oxygen content does not change the distribution of Fe between Cu (2) and Cu (1) sites[18] and after the high-pressure synthesis the T_{c} of the HP samples with low Fe content can be increased up to that of pure YBCO, the decrease of T_{c} of Fe-doped YBCO is reasonably attributed to the hole fillings of Fe3+ and Fe4+ ions in CuO_x_ chains and CuO2 planes, respectively.[16, 35] In Ref. [16], Terziev _et al._ found that in Y1-Ca,SrCu2.Fc0.4O7+-y compound the addition of x = 0.1 Ca increases T_{c} from 0 to 28 K. The same phenomenon was found by Smith _et al._ in the Y1-Ca,SrSrCu2.Fc0.5O7+-y compound.[17] Terziev _et al._[16] and Smith _et al._[17] determined the distribution of Fe between Cu(1) sites and Cu(2) sites and found that about 15% of Fe content is located in the CuO2 planes for Y0.9Ca0.1Sr2Cu2.6Fe0.4O7+-y and Y0.9Ca0.1Sr2Cu2.5Fe0.5O7+-y compounds. Moreover, in these two compounds the Fe(2) is Fe3+ species with high spin 5/2 which does not produce magnetic pair-breaking effect. Thus revivals of superconductivity in Y0.9Ca0.1Sr2Cu2.6Fe0.4O7+-y and Y0.9Ca0.1Sr2Cu2.5Fe0.5O7+-y compounds were reasonably attributed to the introduction of excess holes by the substitution of Ca2+ for Y3+.[16, 17] In other words, the decrease of T_{c} in Fe-doped Y123 is caused by the hole fillings of Fe3+ and Fe4+ ions.[16, 35] This conclusion is well consistent with the results obtained by Faiz _et al._ using x-ray absorption spectroscopy to study Fe-doped YBCO.[35]

Based on the above, it is speculated that for the AM samples with high Fe content of x > 0.3, the oxygen uptake in air only satisfies the charge balances and does not provide excess holes which participate in superconductivity. For the HP samples, excess holes were produced due to the high-pressure synthesis. Thus, the superconductivity in Fe-doped YBCO is improved in the HP samples.

One will ask why the Fe3+ ion with magnetism does not destroy the superconductivity in HP samples with high Fe content? By the magnetic measurements, it is found that the weak ferromagnetism and superconductivity coexist in the HP sample with x = 0.50 by the formation of a spontaneous vortex phase (SVP).[36] Moreover, the SVP prevents ferromagnetism from destroying superconductivity.[36]

## IV Conclusions

In this paper, the structure, oxygen content, superconductivity and Mossbauer spectroscopy measurements on Fe,Cu1-xBa2YCu2O7+-y superconductors synthesized by high pressure were systematically studied. On the one hand, the high-pressure synthesis led to the increase of the oxygen content and improvement of the superconductivity in the HP samples. On the other hand, the number of sixfold or fivefold oxygen coordinated Fe in the chains increases after the high-pressure synthesis, i.e., the high-pressure synthesis modifies the local structure on the atomic scale. Thus, it is suggested that the increases of oxygen content and the coordination number of Fe in the chains are the important factors for the improvement of superconductivity in the HP samples.

###### Abstract

The superconductivity in Fe_{x}Cu_{1-x}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y} superconductors (0.00 \leq x \leq 0.70) is improved by high-pressure (HP) synthesis. The HP samples have higher oxygen content than the ambient pressure (AM) samples. Mossbauer effect studies confirmed that the high-pressure synthesis changes the local structure on the atomic scale. For the HP samples Fe (2) in the CuO_{2} planes has highly symmetric pyramidal-oxygen coordination. The tetragonal coordinated Fe (1) in the CuO_{x} chains disappears and becomes the one having fivefold and sixfold oxygen coordination after the high-pressure synthesis. This suggests that the increase of oxygen content and the change of local structure are important reasons for the improvement of superconductivity in the HP samples.

The synthesis temperature was controlled by the electrical input power imposed on the graphite sleeve. The resultant products were quenched from 1000 ^{\circ}C to room temperature by shutting off the electrical power before releasing the pressure. These products were named HP samples.

### Sample characterization

Both the AM and HP samples were characterized by powder XRD using a MXP18A-HF type diffractometer with CuK_{\alpha} radiation.

The powderx program [23] was used to determine the lattice parameters. The results indicate that all the AM and HP samples of Fe_{x}Cu_{1-x}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y} are of single phase except for the samples with x = 0.80 and the solid solubility limit of Fe in the Fe_{x}Cu_{1-x}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y} system is about 0.80, which is consistent with the results of Tarascon _et al._[5] From the dependence of lattice parameters on Fe content as shown in Fig. 1, it is found that the AM samples become tetragonal at x \approx 0.10, which is consistent with previous reports on the Fe-doped YBCO. [5, 8, 9] The HP samples have smaller lattice parameter c and unit-cell volume than the AM samples, which is related to the increase of oxygen content in the HP samples due to the high-pressure synthesis. This phenomenon has been observed in YBCO synthesized in air [24] or in the high-pressure oxygen [25] and in Fe-doped YSr_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} synthesized in high-pressure oxygen. [18, 20]

Figure 2 shows the typical XRD patterns of AM-(a) and HP-(b) samples of Fe_{0.5}Cu_{0.8}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y}, [21] Structural analysis indicates that they have tetragonal structure belonging to space group P4/_mmm_. The lattice parameters of AM and HP samples are a = 0.3874, c = 1.167 nm and a = 0.3865, c = 1.1598 nm, respectively.

### Measurements of oxygen content

The oxygen contents of the AM and HP samples were measured using iodometric titration. [27] It must be pointed out that there was a small amount of KCl and KClO_{4} in the HP samples due to the addition of KClO_{4} used as an oxidant and the incomplete decomposition during the high-pressure synthesis. To minimize its influence on the titration results, the bulk HP samples were powdered, washed using distilled water and dried below 80 ^{\circ}C before determining the oxygen content. The purified powder was still superconducting as checked by magnetization measurements. The results of iodometric titration indicate that the oxygen contents in both the AM and HP samples increase with increasing Fe content, as shown in Fig. 3. Also one can find that the HP-samples have higher oxygen content than the AM samples. The oxygen content in the AM samples is well consistent with those reported in Refs. [8, 24], and [27].

### Superconductivity

dc magnetic measurements were performed using a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS type). Figure 4 shows _M-T_ curves of the AM-(a) and HP-(b) samples. The dependence of _T__{c} on Fe content for the HP and AM samples is shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that for the AM samples _T__{c} decreases quickly with increasing Fe content and becomes zero at x = 0.4, which is in agreement with the results of Tarascon _et al._[8] For the HP samples, however, with increasing Fe content the decrease of _T__{c} is very slow, indicating that the high-pressure synthesis improves superconductivity.

Figure 6 shows the _R-T_ and _M-T_ curves of the AM and HP samples of Fe_{0.5}Cu_{0.5}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y}. These results indicate that the HP sample has a superconducting transition temperature _T__{c}=80 K. The shielding and Meissner fraction is about 50 and 24 %, respectively, indicating that the HP sample with x = 0.50 has bulk superconductivity. The AM sample has a semiconductorlike behavior in the _R-T_ curve, even after oxygenation at 350 ^{\circ}C for 40 h in flowing oxygen under ambient pressure.

### Annealing experiments

In order to know the stability of oxygen absorbed (HPO) in the lattice due to the high-pressure synthesis and find out the possible reasons for the improvement of superconductivity, two HP samples were selected for annealing experiments at different temperatures.

Two typical HP samples (A) Fe_{0.06}Cu_{0.94}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.25} and (B) Fe_{0.5}Cu_{0.9}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.41} were annealed at 150, 250, 350, 450, 650, and 900 ^{\circ}C for 2 h in air and then quenched to room temperature. The reasons for selecting these two HP samples are that the AM samples of the HP samples (A) and (B) have orthorhombic and tetragonal structure, respectively. On the other hand, the AM sample of (A) is superconducting and that of (B) is an insulator. It is advantageous to distinguish the influence of HPO on structure and superconductivity of samples during the annealing process. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) show the influence of the annealing temperature (T_{o}) on the M-T curves of the annealed HP samples (A) and (B), respectively. Results indicate that the T_{c} of HP sample (B) gradually decreases with increasing T_{a} and becomes zero at T_{a} \approx 450 ^{\circ}C. For the HP sample (A), T_{c} is constant in the annealing temperature range of 150-350 ^{\circ}C, then at 450 ^{\circ}C decreases to 85 K which is as high as T_{c} of its AM sample (see Fig. 8).

On the other hand, the lattice parameters of the two annealed HP samples have also changed regularly with increasing T_{a}. Figure 9 shows the influence of T_{a} on the local XRD patterns (46^{\circ} \approx 2\theta \approx 48^{\circ}) of the two annealed HP samples.

Figure 3: The dependence of oxygen content on Fe content for the AM and HP samples of Fe_{x}Cu_{1-x}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y}. The limit of measurement error is less than 0.02.

Figure 2: XRD patterns of the AM sample (a) and HP sample (b) of Fe_{0.5}Cu_{0.5}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y} compound.

Figure 4: The M-T curves of the AM (a) and HP (b) samples of Fe_{x}Cu_{1-x}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y}.

 The dependence of lattice parameters a, b, and c on T_{a} is shown in Fig. 10. For the HP sample (A), the shift of the diffraction peak of (006) to lower angle is not obvious at 150 ^{\circ}C \leq T_{a} \leq 350 ^{\circ}C. For T_{a} \geq 350 ^{\circ}C, the peak of (006) gradually shifts to lower angle and the peaks of (002) and (200) become apparent. This means that lattice parameter c increases gradually and the HP sample (A) undergoes a tetragonal-orthorhombic structural transition during the annealing process, which can be found in Fig. 9(a). For the HP sample (B), the peak of (006) shifts to lower angle with increasing T_{a} [see Fig. 9(b)], indicating that lattice parameter c increases with increasing T_{a}, as shown in Fig. 10(b). It is well known that in the pure YBCO system, the length of lattice parameter c is inversely proportional to the oxygen content. The more oxygen content the samples have, the shorter the lattice parameter c becomes. Based on this and the change of lattice parameter c during the whole annealing process, it is speculated that with increasing annealing temperature the oxygen content of the HP samples (A) and (B) is gradually released. The release of HPO results in the absence of superconductivity in the HP sample (B) and a decrease of T_{c} in HP sample (A) at T_{a}=450 ^{\circ}C. From these observa

Figure 8: The dependence of T_{c} on T_{a} for the HP samples (A) Fe_{0.06}Cu_{0.094}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.25} and (B) Fe_{0.5}Cu_{0.3}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.41}.

  tions, we suggest that the HPO plays an important role in the improvement of superconductivity in the HP samples. The annealing experiments also indicate that the HPO is different from the oxygen entering the lattice in air under ambient pressure. The latter enters the lattice at 350 - 500 ^{\circ}C.[24]

### F. Mossbauer effect

The Mossbauer technique has been shown [5, 6, 7, 16, 17, 18] to be a powerful tool determining the distribution of Fe between Cu (1) and Cu (2) sites. In order to obtain information on the distribution of Fe between the Cu (1) and Cu (2) sites in the AM and HP samples and to further find out the reasons for the improvement of superconductivity in the HP samples, five samples with different Fe content, one AM sample Fe_{0.5}Cu_{0.5}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.24} and four HP samples Fe_{0.16}Cu_{0.84}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.30}, Fe_{0.32}Cu_{0.68}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.34}, Fe_{0.04}Cu_{0.68}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.40}, and Fe_{0.5}Cu_{0.5}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.41}, were selected for Mossbauer effect studies.

^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectra of samples were recorded by a Wissel System constant acceleration Mossbauer spectrometer with ^{57}Co (Pd) source at room temperature. The velocity was calibrated using \alpha-Fe foil. The values of isomer shift given here were relative to \alpha-Fe at room temperature. A least-squares program was used to fit the spectra with Lorenzian line shapes.

Figures 11 and 12 show the results of Mossbauer effect of the selected AM and HP samples. The spectra can be best fit to four subspectra (A, B, C, and D). The hyperfine parameters of isomer shift (\delta), quadrupole splittings (\Delta), full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) (\Gamma), and site intensity ratio (I_{n}/I) of these four subspectra are summarized in Table 1. A consensus that doublets A, C, and D are ascribed to the Fe located at Cu (1) sites and subspectrum B is related to the Fe located at Cu (2) sites has been obtained.[5, 17, 18, 29] Moreover, the Fe atoms corresponding to doublets A, C, and D have tetragonal, fivefold, and sixfold oxygen coordination,[5, 18, 29] respectively, and the Fe corresponding to subspectrum B has the same pyramidal configuration of oxygen as Cu (2).[5, 17, 18, 29]

Figures 11(1), 11(2) and 11(3) show the Mossbauer spectra of the HP samples (1) Fe_{0.16}Cu_{0.84}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.30}, (2) Fe_{0.32}Cu_{0.68}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.34}, and (3) Fe_{0.4}Cu_{0.68}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.40}, respectively. From the three figures, two main features can be observed. One is that the subspectrum B of the HP samples with x\ll 0.40 is a singlet splitting while subspectrum B is a doublet splitting of the HP sample with x=0.50 [see Fig. 12(2)]. The singlet splitting implies that the oxygen environment about the Fe located in CuO_{2} planes is highly symmetric. The other main feature is that the Mossbauer spectra of HP samples with x=0.16 and 0.32 can be fit well according to three subspectra and doublet D is attributed to the sixfold coordinated Fe in CuO_{x} chains.[29]

Figure 11: (Color online) Room-temperature Mössbauer spectra of the HP samples (1) Fe_{0.16}Cu_{0.84}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.30}, (2) Fe_{0.32}Cu_{0.68}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.34}, and (3) Fe_{0.4}Cu_{0.68}Ba_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7.40}. The notation (i)n denotes that the Fe occupies Cu(i) site and has n-fold oxygen coordination.

  In order to obviously observe the changes in the local oxygen environment about Fe after the high-pressure synthesis, a comparison between the Mossbauer spectra of the HP samples with x = 0.50 and that of its AM sample is indispensable (see Fig. 12). One can find that the doublet C increases at the expense of the doublet A in going from the AM sample to the HP sample and the doublet A disappears in the spectra of HP sample. This means that for the HP sample with x = 0.50 all the Fe atoms located in CuO_{x} chains have fivefold oxygen coordination, which is similar to the results of YSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Fe_{0.3}O_{7+y} prepared by high-pressure oxygen annealing.[18] From the data listed in Table I, it can be found that for the AM sample with x = 0.50 the sum of integrated intensities of doublets A and C is almost equal to that of doublet C in the spectrum of the HP sample, indicating that the integrated intensities of Fe located in CuO_{x} chains is not changed after the high-pressure synthesis. In the Mossbauer spectroscopy, site-integrated intensities are proportional to site occupancy N if we assume that the recoil-free fraction is same.[30] Thus, for the AM and HP samples, 76% of Fe content occupies Cu (1) sites in CuO_{x} chains and 24% of Fe content occupies Cu (2) sites in CuO_{2} plane. The results of Mossbauer spectroscopy indicate that the high-pressure synthesis does not result in the migration of Fe from CuO_{2} planes to CuO_{x} chains.

From Mossbauer spectra, it can also be determined that the Fe corresponding to doublets A and B have valence of +3 and the Fe associated with doublet C and D is Fe^{4+} species,[18, 29] indicating that the average valence of Fe ion in the HP samples is higher than that in the AM sample.

## III Discussions

The perovskite structure of the Y123 compound has two copper sites Cu(1) in CuO_{x} chains and Cu(2) in CuO_{2} planes. From the results of the neutron and Mossbauer spectra data,[5, 11, 12, 18, 31] it was found that the Fe can occupy two Cu sites and Co only substitutes for Cu(1).[18, 32] Most of the previous studies on the Fe- or Co-doped Y123 system attempted to correlate the decrease of _T_{c}_ with the magnetic pair-breaking effect because of magnetism of Fe^{3+} and Co^{3+} ions.[8, 33]

In recent years, however, the superconductivity was improved and discovered in YSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Fe_{0.3}O_{7+y},[18] FeSr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y},[19] and codoped CoSr_{2}Y_{1-x}Ca_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7+y} compounds[34] synthesized under the high-pressure oxygen synthesis and the high-pressure oxygen annealing enhance _T_{c}_ of YSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Fe_{0.3}O_{7+y}, FeSr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y}, and codoped CoSr_{2}Y_{1-x}Ca_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7+y} compounds? Three explanations were put forward to answer this question as follows. (1) The improvement of superconductivity in the YSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Fe_{0.3}O_{7+y} was attributed to the increases of oxygen content and the trigonal bipyramidal coordinated Fe at Cu (1) site in CuO_{x} chains due to high-pressure oxygen annealing.[18] This explanation is supported by the results of XRD, measurements of oxygen content and Mossbauer effect analysis.[18] (2) For the FeSr_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7+y} superconductor prepared by calcining at 900 ^{\circ}C in air, subsequent annealing at 800 ^{\circ}C in flowing N_{2} and then oxidizing at 350 ^{\circ}C in high-pressure oxygen of 195 atm, superconductivity is induced by both the ordering of Cu and Fe atoms in chains and the increase of oxygen content.[19, 20, 26, 28] (3) The occurrence of superconductivity in the CoSr_{2}Y_{1-x}Ca_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7+y} system was attributed to the presence of the excess holes[34] due to the increase of oxygen content and the substitution of Ca^{2+} for Y^{3+}.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} Sample & x = & Site & \delta (mm/s) & \Delta (mm/s) & \Gamma (mm/s) & _I_{n}/I_ \\ HP & 0.16 & B: & 0.334(6) & & & 0.131(1) & 0.20(1) \\  & & C: & -0.034(6) & 0.972(0) & 0.221(0) & 0.66(3) \\  & & D: & -0.064(8) & 0.281(4) & 0.101(3) & 0.14(2) \\ HP & 0.32 & B: & 0.487(8) & &  From our present work, it was found that the high-pressure synthesis not only increases oxygen content but also modifies the local structure on the atomic scale. For instance, in the Mossbauer spectra of the HP samples with lower Fe content of x <= 0.40 the site B has singlet splitting, suggesting that oxygen environment about Fe(2) has higher symmetry. At the same time, Fe(1) in CuO_x_ chains has fivefold and sixfold oxygen coordination. These changes of the local structure are possibly conducive to the improvement of superconductivity.

In order to understand well the changes of the local structure, one can compare the Mossbauer spectrum of the HP sample with x = 0.5 with that of its AM sample [see Figs. 12(1) and 12(2)]. It is found that the Mossbauer spectrum of the AM sample consists of three subspectra and that of the HP sample only consists of two subspectra. According to the assignments of Fe configuration, one can find that for the HP sample all the Fe(1) atoms in CuO_x_ chains have fivefold oxygen coordination (trigonal bipyramid).[18] The fivefold oxygen coordination has been discussed in YSrSrCu2.Fc0.3O7+-y superconductor synthesized by high-pressure oxygen annealing.[18] It is possible that the trigonal bipyramidal coordinated Fe in the chains improve the coupling between the two adjacent CuO2 planes[18] and is favorable to charge transfer from CuO_x_ chains to CuO2 planes. Therefore, the superconductivity in Fe-doped YBCO is improved after the high-pressure synthesis.

The results of Mossbauer effect indicate that for the sample with x = 0.50 20% of the whole Fe content is located in CuO2 planes and Fe(2) is the Fe3+ species with magnetism. It is worth noting that the T_{c} of the HP sample with x = 0.5 is enhanced up to 80 K, suggesting that the magnetic pairing-breaking effect is not obvious. Since the variation of oxygen content does not change the distribution of Fe between Cu (2) and Cu (1) sites[18] and after the high-pressure synthesis the T_{c} of the HP samples with low Fe content can be increased up to that of pure YBCO, the decrease of T_{c} of Fe-doped YBCO is reasonably attributed to the hole fillings of Fe3+ and Fe4+ ions in CuO_x_ chains and CuO2 planes, respectively.[16, 35] In Ref. [16], Terziev _et al._ found that in Y1-Ca,SrCu2.Fc0.4O7+-y compound the addition of x = 0.1 Ca increases T_{c} from 0 to 28 K. The same phenomenon was found by Smith _et al._ in the Y1-Ca,SrSrCu2.Fc0.5O7+-y compound.[17] Terziev _et al._[16] and Smith _et al._[17] determined the distribution of Fe between Cu(1) sites and Cu(2) sites and found that about 15% of Fe content is located in the CuO2 planes for Y0.9Ca0.1Sr2Cu2.6Fe0.4O7+-y and Y0.9Ca0.1Sr2Cu2.5Fe0.5O7+-y compounds. Moreover, in these two compounds the Fe(2) is Fe3+ species with high spin 5/2 which does not produce magnetic pair-breaking effect. Thus revivals of superconductivity in Y0.9Ca0.1Sr2Cu2.6Fe0.4O7+-y and Y0.9Ca0.1Sr2Cu2.5Fe0.5O7+-y compounds were reasonably attributed to the introduction of excess holes by the substitution of Ca2+ for Y3+.[16, 17] In other words, the decrease of T_{c} in Fe-doped Y123 is caused by the hole fillings of Fe3+ and Fe4+ ions.[16, 35] This conclusion is well consistent with the results obtained by Faiz _et al._ using x-ray absorption spectroscopy to study Fe-doped YBCO.[35]

Based on the above, it is speculated that for the AM samples with high Fe content of x > 0.3, the oxygen uptake in air only satisfies the charge balances and does not provide excess holes which participate in superconductivity. For the HP samples, excess holes were produced due to the high-pressure synthesis. Thus, the superconductivity in Fe-doped YBCO is improved in the HP samples.

One will ask why the Fe3+ ion with magnetism does not destroy the superconductivity in HP samples with high Fe content? By the magnetic measurements, it is found that the weak ferromagnetism and superconductivity coexist in the HP sample with x = 0.50 by the formation of a spontaneous vortex phase (SVP).[36] Moreover, the SVP prevents ferromagnetism from destroying superconductivity.[36]

## IV Conclusions

In this paper, the structure, oxygen content, superconductivity and Mossbauer spectroscopy measurements on Fe,Cu1-xBa2YCu2O7+-y superconductors synthesized by high pressure were systematically studied. On the one hand, the high-pressure synthesis led to the increase of the oxygen content and improvement of the superconductivity in the HP samples. On the other hand, the number of sixfold or fivefold oxygen coordinated Fe in the chains increases after the high-pressure synthesis, i.e., the high-pressure synthesis modifies the local structure on the atomic scale. Thus, it is suggested that the increases of oxygen content and the coordination number of Fe in the chains are the important factors for the improvement of superconductivity in the HP samples.
