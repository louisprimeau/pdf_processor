###### Abstract

Pressure effects on the superconductivity and magnetic order of polycrystalline Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu4O8 (0 <= x <= 1) were investigated. It was found that _T__{c} decreases monotonically with Pr concentration x from _T__{c}\sim80 K for x = 0 to _T__{c}\sim6 K for x = 0.7. The critical Pr concentration _x__{\rm cr} required to suppress the _T__{c} to zero is estimated to be around 0.72, which is larger than that (~0.55) in Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7. The normal-state resistivity remains in the same order of magnitude through whole series in contrast to a metal-insulator transition observed in Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7. A change of sign in the value of (_dT__{c}/_dP_)__{P = 0} in Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu4O8 with Pr doping is observed which is similar to that of Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7. The _T__{N} in PrBa2Cu4O8 decreases with increasing external pressure as in PrBa2Cu3O7. The results for _T__{c} and _T__{N} variations with Pr doping and pressure effect in Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu4O8 cannot be fully explained by the recent hybridization theory.

It is well known [1, 2] that in YBa2Cu3O7-_δ_ (Y123), the substitution of Pr for Y destroys superconductivity while other rare-earth elements, even if they are magnetic do not affect superconductivity. [3, 4, 5] Despite the large number of experimental and theoretical works that have been done, the depression of superconductivity in Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7-_δ_ [(Y,Pr)123] is still not completely understood. Moreover, the pressure dependence of superconducting transition temperature _T__{c} for Pr-doped Y123 behaves anomalously. [6] However, very recently it has been reported that Pr123 single crystals grown by the traveling-solvent floating-zone method show superconductivity and _T__{c} enhancement under pressure. [7, 8] This absence or occurrence of superconductivity in Pr123 has made the issue more interesting and reopened the field for discussion. As a consequence, the substitution of Pr for Y in the YBa2Cu4O8 (Y124) has also received much attention. Several groups [9, 10] have already reported on the Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu4O8 [(Y,Pr)124], only with x \leq 0.8, because of the unsuccessful synthesis of PrBa2Cu4O8 (Pr124) in previous years. Very recently, we have successfully synthesized Pr124 at ambient oxygen pressure. [11, 12] In the present report, we have systematically studied the pressure effect on _T__{c} and _T__{N} of the Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu4O8 (with 0 <= x <= 1) in order to better understand the _T__{c} suppression and magnetic coupling mechanisms of high _T__{N} in these Pr-doped systems.

The sample preparation for Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu4O8 (0 <= x <= 1) was described else where. [11, 12] It is noted that the annealing temperature is 800 degC for 0 <= x <= 0.4 and 870 degC for 0.6 <= x <= 1. The structural analysis was carried out by powder x-ray diffraction using Cu _K_\alpha radiation. Low-angle (2 _th_ = 5deg - 10deg) x-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis showed that all samples are basically single YBa2Cu4O8 (124) phase without any indication of YBa2Cu3O7 (123) impurity. But for samples with x >= 0.8, very few impurity peaks from BaCuO2, estimated to be less than 5%, were found. There is no correlation between the Pr content and the amount of impurity phase, indicating that the depression of superconductivity in the studied system does not result from the impurity phase. The a and b axes and unit-cell volume V are found to increase with x as has been found in (Y,Pr)123 (Ref. 5). Similar to (Y,Pr)123 (Ref. 5), the c axis in (Y,Pr)124 increases very slightly with x. The pressure dependences of _T__{c} and _T__{N} were determined for a bulk sample by a low-frequency (16.2 Hz) ac magnetic-susceptibility technique using a piston-cylinder type Be-Cu hydrostatic pressure clamp. 3M fluorimet liquid was used as the pressure transmitting fluid. Pressure was applied at room temperature and determined at low temperature by means of a superconducting lead manometer.

In Fig. 1 the resistivity is plotted as a function of temperature for different Pr concentrations in (Y,Pr)124. The samples with x up to 0.7 display metallic behavior in the

 normal-state resistivity. For x = 0.9 and 1.0 samples the resistivity takes a maximum, respectively, around 125 and 200 K, below which both the samples exhibit metallic conduction. This is in contrast to (Y,Pr)123 with x >= 0.5, where the normal-state behavior is semiconducting.5 The variation of T_{c}(x)/T_{c}(0) as a function of x for (Y,Pr)124 is shown in Fig. 2, where, T_{c}(0) is the T_{c} for x = 0 sample and T_{c}(x) is the T_{c} of the sample with corresponding x. It is found that the value of _x_cr (critical concentration of Pr, where T_{c} disappears) for (Y,Pr)124 is estimated to be ~0.72 which is larger than that (_x_cr ~0.55) of (Y,Pr)123. According to the hybridization theory proposed in Refs. [13] and [14], the larger _x_cr in (Y,Pr)124 suggests that the hybridization has a weaker hole-depletion power than in (Y,Pr)123. However, both (Y,Pr)124 and (Y,Pr)123 contain same CuO_{2}-(Y,Pr)-CuO_{2} layers, which play an important role in the hybridization theory. Therefore, it is difficult to explain this T_{c} depression, i.e., larger _x_cr value in (Y,Pr)124 than that in (Y,Pr)123 by a hole-depletion mechanism, especially because Y124 is a underdoped cuprate. It is also noted that the _x_cr value in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7} is ~0.85 (Ref. [15]) and this system has the tetragonal symmetry instead of the orthorhombic structure of Y123. The different parameters for (Y,Pr)123, (Y,Pr)124, and Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7} are listed in Table 1 for comparison. The normal-state resistivity (\rho) at 250 K as a function of x for (Y,Pr)124, shown in Fig. 2, increases slightly with increase of Pr content up to x = 0.7, and is nearly constant for x > 0.7. But in the (Y,Pr)123 system, resistivity increases rapidly for x > 0.55 with increasing Pr content.5 This is due to the double Cu-O chains in (Y,Pr)124 instead of a single Cu-O chain in (Y,Pr)123. It is also well established that both single and double Cu-O chains are metallic in Y123 and Y124 (Refs. [16]-[18]). NMR and NQR measurements have shown that spin susceptibilities on the planes and chains are markedly different,[19]-[21] suggesting that the two conducting channels (CuO_{2} sheet and CuO chain) may act independently of one another. Therefore, it is plausible that both the higher _x_cr and the absence of the metal-insulator transition in (Y,Pr)124 are due to the double CuO chains.

The T_{c}(P) data obtained from the temperature dependence of ac susceptibility under different hydrostatic pressures for (Y,Pr)124 samples are displayed in Fig. 3, where the change in T_{c} with P is depicted as \left\{T_{c}(P)/T_{c}(0)\right\}-1\left[1\right] for clarity, and T_{c}(0) is the T_{c} at ambient pressure. These data reveal the following features: The Y124 compound exhibits a linear increase of T_{c} with P to ~16 kbar at the rate dT_{c}/dP = 0.63 K/kbar. This is in reasonable agreement with a previously reported value of 0.66 K/kbar (Ref. [22]). The large positive dT_{c}/dP observed for Y124 has been interpreted to be caused by carrier transfer from the double CuO chains to the CuO_{2} sheets in this underdoped material.[23]-[24] This interference is supported by high pressure neutron-diffraction refinement.[25]-[26] The sample with x = 0.2 shows positive initial slope (0.65 K/kbar) and displays a distinct maximum at ~6 kbar followed by a decrease. The sample with x = 0.4 shows a maximum at ~2.5 kbar, suggesting the

The values of T_{c} at ambient pressure T_{c}(0) and the initial rate of change of T_{c} with pressure, \left(dT_{c}/dP\right)_{P=0}, for each value of x are listed in the figure. The lines drawn through the data are guides to the eye.

  occurrence of a pressure-induced change of electronic property in the vicinity of 2.5 kbar. The samples with x>\,0.4 show a rapid monotonic decrease of T_{c} with P. These data imply that the increase of Pr concentration x has the effect of shifting the maximum of T_{c}(P) curve from higher to lower pressures and eventually to zero pressure above x=\,0.4. At this point, (dT_{c}/dP)_{P=0} changes sign from positive to negative. Neumeier _et al._[27] explained T_{c}(P) data for (Y,Pr)123 considering the hybridization of the Pr 4f electrons and plane O 2p states. It is noted that (dT_{c}/dP)_{P=0} of (Y,Pr)123 changes sign in between x=\,0.3 and 0.4, which is lower than that of (Y,Pr)124 (in this case sign changes above x=\,0.4). Therefore, if the hybridization scenario is suitable to explain the T_{c}(P) both in (Y,Pr)124 and (Y,Pr)123, it seems that the pressure-induced enhancement of hybridization is weaker in (Y,Pr)124 than in (Y,Pr)123. On the other hand, for x=\,0.2 the T_{c}(P) in (Y,Pr)123 shows maximum at pressure >16 kbar which is higher than that (\sim6 kbar) in (Y,Pr)124. From this point of view, the hybridization mechanism may not fully explain the T_{c}(x,P) behavior in the (Y,Pr)124 system.

The anomaly observed in the \chi_{\rm ac}(T) curve (Fig. 4) is due to the antiferromagnetic ordering of Pr sublattices. It is found that in Pr124 the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature (T_{N}) decreases with the increase of pressure as found in Pr123 (Ref. [28]). In both the cases the value of T_{N} (\sim17 K) and the pressure depression rate dT_{N}/dP(\,\sim\,-\,1 K/kbar) are nearly identical and anomalously high. Therefore, magnetic coupling of Pr-containing cuprates may be related to CuO_{2} planes rather than CuO chains. In fact, the issue of the correlation between T_{c} and T_{N} in Pr-based cuprates has long been interesting and controversial.[29] In the case of single CuO chain containing Pr-based cuprates, it has been discussed earlier[30] that a strong magnetic correlation, which is caused or mediated by an enhanced hybridization of Pr 4f electrons with holes in the CuO_{2} planes, is the primary origin for the suppression of T_{c} . But in the present investigation, it is found that in Pr-rich (Y,Pr)124 system, which contains double CuO chains, both T_{c} and T_{N} are suppressed with the increase of pressure. Furthermore, the T_{N} for both Pr123 and Pr124 is around 17 K, while, no magnetic ordering transition is found in PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7} (see Table 1). Therefore, the correlation between T_{c} suppression and high T_{N} becomes unclear in the present state.

In summary, T_{c}(x,P) in (Y,Pr)124 and T_{N}(P) in Pr124 have been studied and compared to those in (Y,Pr)123 and Pr123, respectively. The T_{c} decreases at a slower rate with increasing Pr concentration x in (Y,Pr)124 than that in (Y,Pr)123. There is no evidence for a metal-insulator transition in (Y,Pr)124 in contrast to a metal-insulator transition occurring at x\sim0.55 in (Y,Pr)123. This may be due to the double CuO chains of (Y,Pr)124 instead of a single CuO chain in (Y,Pr)123. Therefore, CuO chains should play a role in both the normal-state conductivity and superconductivity. At least three points are available from the data to argue that the hybridization mechanism cannot fully explain the T_{c}(x,P) and T_{N}(P) behavior of (Y,Pr)124:

* From the x_{\rm cr} values it seems that the hybridization is weaker in (Y,Pr)124 (x_{\rm cr}\sim0.72) than in (Y,Pr)123 (x_{\rm cr}\sim0.55). This can explain the sign change of (dT_{c}/dT)_{P=0} at x>0.4 for (Y,Pr)124 and in between x=\,0.3 and 0.4 for (Y,Pr)123 but cannot explain T_{c} maxima for x=\,0.2 samples which occur at P=\,6 kbar in (Y,Pr)124 and at P>16 kbar in (Y,Pr)123.
* If the hybridization is weaker in (Y,Pr)124 than in (Y,Pr)123, then nearly identical values of T_{N} and dT_{N}/dP in Pr124 and Pr123 cannot be explained.
* If the hybridization occurs in CuO_{2} planes, it may reduce T_{c} and enhance T_{N} in Pr-rich samples. In that case it is difficult to explain the data in the present investigation where external pressure suppresses both T_{c} and T_{N} in Pr-rich samples.

###### Abstract

Pressure effects on the superconductivity and magnetic order of polycrystalline Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu4O8 (0 <= x <= 1) were investigated. It was found that _T__{c} decreases monotonically with Pr concentration x from _T__{c}\sim80 K for x = 0 to _T__{c}\sim6 K for x = 0.7. The critical Pr concentration _x__{\rm cr} required to suppress the _T__{c} to zero is estimated to be around 0.72, which is larger than that (~0.55) in Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7. The normal-state resistivity remains in the same order of magnitude through whole series in contrast to a metal-insulator transition observed in Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7. A change of sign in the value of (_dT__{c}/_dP_)__{P = 0} in Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu4O8 with Pr doping is observed which is similar to that of Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7. The _T__{N} in PrBa2Cu4O8 decreases with increasing external pressure as in PrBa2Cu3O7. The results for _T__{c} and _T__{N} variations with Pr doping and pressure effect in Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu4O8 cannot be fully explained by the recent hybridization theory.

 normal-state resistivity. For x = 0.9 and 1.0 samples the resistivity takes a maximum, respectively, around 125 and 200 K, below which both the samples exhibit metallic conduction. This is in contrast to (Y,Pr)123 with x >= 0.5, where the normal-state behavior is semiconducting.5 The variation of T_{c}(x)/T_{c}(0) as a function of x for (Y,Pr)124 is shown in Fig. 2, where, T_{c}(0) is the T_{c} for x = 0 sample and T_{c}(x) is the T_{c} of the sample with corresponding x.

It is also noted that the _x_cr value in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7} is ~0.85 (Ref. [15]) and this system has the tetragonal symmetry instead of the orthorhombic structure of Y123. The different parameters for (Y,Pr)123, (Y,Pr)124, and Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7} are listed in Table 1 for comparison. The normal-state resistivity (\rho) at 250 K as a function of x for (Y,Pr)124, shown in Fig. 2, increases slightly with increase of Pr content up to x = 0.7, and is nearly constant for x > 0.7. But in the (Y,Pr)123 system, resistivity increases rapidly for x > 0.55 with increasing Pr content.5 This is due to the double Cu-O chains in (Y,Pr)124 instead of a single Cu-O chain in (Y,Pr)123. It is also well established that both single and double Cu-O chains are metallic in Y123 and Y124 (Refs. [16]-[18]). NMR and NQR measurements have shown that spin susceptibilities on the planes and chains are markedly different,[19]-[21] suggesting that the two conducting channels (CuO_{2} sheet and CuO chain) may act independently of one another. Therefore, it is plausible that both the higher _x_cr and the absence of the metal-insulator transition in (Y,Pr)124 are due to the double CuO chains.

The T_{c}(P) data obtained from the temperature dependence of ac susceptibility under different hydrostatic pressures for (Y,Pr)124 samples are displayed in Fig. 3, where the change in T_{c} with P is depicted as \left\{T_{c}(P)/T_{c}(0)\right\}-1\left[1\right] for clarity, and T_{c}(0) is the T_{c} at ambient pressure. These data reveal the following features: The Y124 compound exhibits a linear increase of T_{c} with P to ~16 kbar at the rate dT_{c}/dP = 0.63 K/kbar. This is in reasonable agreement with a previously reported value of 0.66 K/kbar (Ref. [22]). The large positive dT_{c}/dP observed for Y124 has been interpreted to be caused by carrier transfer from the double CuO chains to the CuO_{2} sheets in this underdoped material.[23]-[24] This interference is supported by high pressure neutron-diffraction refinement.[25]-[26] The sample with x = 0.2 shows positive initial slope (0.65 K/kbar) and displays a distinct maximum at ~6 kbar followed by a decrease. The sample with x = 0.4 shows a maximum at ~2.5 kbar, suggesting the

The values of T_{c} at ambient pressure T_{c}(0) and the initial rate of change of T_{c} with pressure, \left(dT_{c}/dP\right)_{P=0}, for each value of x are listed in the figure. The lines drawn through the data are guides to the eye.

  occurrence of a pressure-induced change of electronic property in the vicinity of 2.5 kbar. The samples with x>\,0.4 show a rapid monotonic decrease of T_{c} with P. These data imply that the increase of Pr concentration x has the effect of shifting the maximum of T_{c}(P) curve from higher to lower pressures and eventually to zero pressure above x=\,0.4. At this point, (dT_{c}/dP)_{P=0} changes sign from positive to negative. Neumeier _et al._[27] explained T_{c}(P) data for (Y,Pr)123 considering the hybridization of the Pr 4f electrons and plane O 2p states. It is noted that (dT_{c}/dP)_{P=0} of (Y,Pr)123 changes sign in between x=\,0.3 and 0.4, which is lower than that of (Y,Pr)124 (in this case sign changes above x=\,0.4). Therefore, if the hybridization scenario is suitable to explain the T_{c}(P) both in (Y,Pr)124 and (Y,Pr)123, it seems that the pressure-induced enhancement of hybridization is weaker in (Y,Pr)124 than in (Y,Pr)123. On the other hand, for x=\,0.2 the T_{c}(P) in (Y,Pr)123 shows maximum at pressure >16 kbar which is higher than that (\sim6 kbar) in (Y,Pr)124. From this point of view, the hybridization mechanism may not fully explain the T_{c}(x,P) behavior in the (Y,Pr)124 system.

The anomaly observed in the \chi_{\rm ac}(T) curve (Fig. 4) is due to the antiferromagnetic ordering of Pr sublattices. It is found that in Pr124 the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature (T_{N}) decreases with the increase of pressure as found in Pr123 (Ref. [28]). In both the cases the value of T_{N} (\sim17 K) and the pressure depression rate dT_{N}/dP(\,\sim\,-\,1 K/kbar) are nearly identical and anomalously high. Therefore, magnetic coupling of Pr-containing cuprates may be related to CuO_{2} planes rather than CuO chains. In fact, the issue of the correlation between T_{c} and T_{N} in Pr-based cuprates has long been interesting and controversial.[29] In the case of single CuO chain containing Pr-based cuprates, it has been discussed earlier[30] that a strong magnetic correlation, which is caused or mediated by an enhanced hybridization of Pr 4f electrons with holes in the CuO_{2} planes, is the primary origin for the suppression of T_{c} . But in the present investigation, it is found that in Pr-rich (Y,Pr)124 system, which contains double CuO chains, both T_{c} and T_{N} are suppressed with the increase of pressure. Furthermore, the T_{N} for both Pr123 and Pr124 is around 17 K, while, no magnetic ordering transition is found in PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7} (see Table 1). Therefore, the correlation between T_{c} suppression and high T_{N} becomes unclear in the present state.

In summary, T_{c}(x,P) in (Y,Pr)124 and T_{N}(P) in Pr124 have been studied and compared to those in (Y,Pr)123 and Pr123, respectively. The T_{c} decreases at a slower rate with increasing Pr concentration x in (Y,Pr)124 than that in (Y,Pr)123. There is no evidence for a metal-insulator transition in (Y,Pr)124 in contrast to a metal-insulator transition occurring at x\sim0.55 in (Y,Pr)123. This may be due to the double CuO chains of (Y,Pr)124 instead of a single CuO chain in (Y,Pr)123. Therefore, CuO chains should play a role in both the normal-state conductivity and superconductivity. At least three points are available from the data to argue that the hybridization mechanism cannot fully explain the T_{c}(x,P) and T_{N}(P) behavior of (Y,Pr)124:

* From the x_{\rm cr} values it seems that the hybridization is weaker in (Y,Pr)124 (x_{\rm cr}\sim0.72) than in (Y,Pr)123 (x_{\rm cr}\sim0.55). This can explain the sign change of (dT_{c}/dT)_{P=0} at x>0.4 for (Y,Pr)124 and in between x=\,0.3 and 0.4 for (Y,Pr)123 but cannot explain T_{c} maxima for x=\,0.2 samples which occur at P=\,6 kbar in (Y,Pr)124 and at P>16 kbar in (Y,Pr)123.
* If the hybridization is weaker in (Y,Pr)124 than in (Y,Pr)123, then nearly identical values of T_{N} and dT_{N}/dP in Pr124 and Pr123 cannot be explained.
* If the hybridization occurs in CuO_{2} planes, it may reduce T_{c} and enhance T_{N} in Pr-rich samples. In that case it is difficult to explain the data in the present investigation where external pressure suppresses both T_{c} and T_{N} in Pr-rich samples.
