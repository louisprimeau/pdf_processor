###### Abstract

We report detailed studies of the normal-state resistivity and Hall effect in bulk R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems (R =Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd). We find a linear temperature dependence of the normal-state resistivity \rho_{n} (\rho_{n}\proptoT) and the Hall number n_{H} (n_{H}\proptoT) above T_{c}. For a fixed temperature both \rho_{n} and n_{H} are dependent on the ionic radius of the rare earth r_{B^{3+}}; viz., the larger the R^{3+} ionic radius, the larger \rho_{n} (\rho_{n}\proptor_{B^{3+}}), but the lower n_{H} (n_{H}\propto1/r_{B^{3+}}). At a constant temperature the \rho_{n}\propto1/n_{H} relation is well confirmed for R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} compounds with different R ions. The cotangent of the Hall angle follows a universal T^{2} dependence i.e., cot \theta_{H}= \alphaT^{2}+ C. The slope \alpha decreases with increasing ion size of the rare earth, but the quantity C remains almost constant for R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} compounds with different R. The reduction of T_{c} and the R^{3+} ion-size dependence of \rho_{n} and n_{H} is interpreted in terms of hole generation and hole localization by Ca doping. [S0163-1829(96)04129-X]

## I Introduction

One of the most puzzling problems in the study of high-T_{c} superconductors has been the anomalous linear temperature dependence of their normal-state resistivity \rho_{n} and the Hall number n_{H} above T_{c} over a wide temperature range,[1] which is inconsistent with an isotropic single-band Fermi-liquid description. A complete understanding of these properties is still lacking.

In an isotropic parabolic single-band Fermi-liquid system, the Hall number n_{H}= V/eR_{H} would be the number of carriers per unit cell. For the high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors, due to its T dependence and the complex band structure, n_{H} may not represent the actual carrier concentration. However, the value of n_{H} at a particular T correlates rather consistently with the carrier concentration determined by other methods. n_{H} scales with the actual carrier concentration.

In any transport model, one expects that the carrier concentration scales with the conductivity, namely, \rho\propto1/n. However, for most of the high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors, both \rho and n_{H}\proptoT, and, then, \rho\propton_{H} instead of \rho\propto1/n in the simple Drude model. This fact seems to be the most puzzling in the normal-state transport properties of the high-T_{c} cuprates: _The higher the carrier density, the smaller the conductivity_.

Extensive studies of the Hall effect have been carried out on following 123 systems: (1) YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} with changing the oxygen content \delta^{2-8} (2) Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} with changing the Pr content x,[9,10] (3) YBa_{2}Cu_{3-x}M_{x}O_{7-\delta} (M =Zn, Co, Fe) with changing the transition-metal content x[11, 12, 13, 14] and (4) Y_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} with changing the Ca content x and the oxygen content \delta.[15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

In order to explain the unusual temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient in the normal state of high-T_{c} superconductors, several approaches have been suggested, including conventional band-structure calculations[20] and strongly correlated models,[21, 22] A non-Fermi-liquid-based approach has been suggested by Anderson[23] and a band model involving a square Fermi surface with rounded corners has been suggested by Pickett _et al.[24]_ to understand the Hall-effect 'puzzle' in high-T_{c} superconductors. Alexandrov _et al.[25]_ showed that a quantitative explanation is possible for the temperature dependence of the R_{H} and resistivity using a variation of the bipolaron theory which takes into account Anderson localization of the bosons by disorder.

Among all cation dopings, Ca substitution for Y in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} has received much attention.[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32] The valence state of Ca^{2+} is lower than that of Y^{3+}; such a substitution will generate excess holes and T_{c} is suppressed by the overdoping effect. On the other hand, it has been known that Ca doping is likely to coinproduce oxygen vacancies and this effect reduces the number of generated holes. This indicates that doping with Ca has a counterbalance effect on the suppression of the T_{c}. Ca doping is able to increase the T_{c} of the oxygen-deficient and tetragonal Y-Bu-Cu-O samples.[18, 33] Recently, Yakabe _et al.[19]_ showed that there is a maximum T_{c} of about 90 K with variation of the carrier density in single-phase Y_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin films up to 50% Ca concentration. The value of the maximum T_{c} is independent of Ca concentration.

Ca doping is able to revive the superconductivity (to T_{c}\sim 40 K) of PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, which is a semiconductor.[34, 35] Also, the introduction of Ca will increase T_{c} from 0 to about 82 K in YBa_{2}Cu_{2.64}Co_{0.36}O_{7-\delta}[36] Gnansekar _et al.[37]_ reported that they prepared thin films of M_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (M =Lu, Tb, Th) in single phase. The superconducting transition temperature of the films varies from \approx12 to \approx45 K. The significance is that the composition MBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (M =Lu, Tb, Th) does not form in single phase in bulk form and, in the case of Tb and Th, not even in thin film form.

All of the Hall experiments above[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] have focused on the change of the concentration x of the dopants or the oxygen reduction \delta. As a modification of our previous observation that the R^{3+} ion size has a very strong effect on supercon  ducting and magnetic properties in R1 = _x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_

 we have carried out transport measurements in R0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ systems,51 in which instead of a change of concentration, we change the R3+ ion while leaving the concentration of Pr and oxygen unchanged. We found that at a constant temperature both r_{n} and n_{H} are linearly dependent on the ion size of the rare earth, viz., the larger the R3+ ionic radius, the larger r_{n} , but the lower n_{H} . The cotangent of the Hall angle follows a universal T2 dependence, i.e., cot _th__H_ = _a_T_2+ C. Both the slope a and the quantity C are insensitive to the R ion and remain almost constant. On the basis of our data we proposed a _T__c_-_n__H_ diagram which manifests an "underdoping" behavior of R0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ systems.51

In this paper we report detailed studies of the normal-state resistivity and the Hall effect of bulk Y0.5Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ systems (_R_ = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) in which instead of a change of concentration, we change the R3+ ion while leaving the concentration of Ca (_x_ = 0.1) unchanged. We found that at a constant temperature both r_{n} and n_{H} are dependent on the ionic radius of the rare earth, _r__R_3+, viz., the larger R3+ ionic radius, the larger r_{n} (_r__n__H_ = _a_T_/_r__R_3+). For a fixed temperature the relation of r  1/_n__H_ is well confirmed for R0.9Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ systems with different R ions. _The higher the carrier density, the higher the conductivity_. The cotangent of the Hall angle follows a universal T2 dependence, namely, cot _th_ = _a_T_2+ C. The slope a decreases with increasing ion size of the rare earth, but the quantity C remains almost constant for R0.9Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ compounds with different R ions.

## II Experimental techniques

The ceramic R0.9Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ (_R_ = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) samples were synthesized using a conventional solid-state reaction method. Stoichiometric amounts of high-purity R2O3 (_R_ = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd), BaCO3, CaCO3, and CuO powders were mixed, ground, and calcined at 915 degC for about 24 h in air in Al2O3 crucibles, followed by a slow cooling in the furnace. The resultant powder was then reground again and pressed with about 4 tons/cm2 into pellets, which was then heated at 925-935 degC for 3 days in flowing oxygen, followed by annealing at 680 degC for 10 h, and then slow cooled to 420 degC, where they remained for 20 h before a final slow cool to room temperature. All specimens were annealed in an atmosphere of flowing oxygen to ensure a sufficient oxygen content in the final product. This sinter procedure was repeated at least three times. All samples were prepared at the same time in the same furnace, respectively, to ensure the same sample qualities.

The structures of the samples were investigated using a Rigaku Rotaflex rotating anode powder x-ray diffractometer (Cu _K_a radiation).

The dc magnetization was measured by a Quantum Design magnetometer. The resistivity was measured by the standard four-probe technique. To measure the Hall effect and the longitudinal resistivity a five-probe arrangement was used on rectangular-shaped samples. The rectangular samples were cut from sintered pellets with typical dimensions 2x5x0.5 mm3. In order to perform precise Hall measurements, it was essential to minimize the misalignment of the Hall arms and also to achieve low contact resistance. The contacts were made using gold wires and silver epoxy. After a heat treatment of 2 h at 450 degC in flowing oxygen, the contact resistance was typically less than 0.5 O for contact surfaces smaller than 0.1 mm2. Samples were mounted on small sapphire substrates.

The experiments were performed in a commercial Oxford Dewar with a superconducting magnet. To extract the Hall voltage, a signal was measured at two reversal directions of the measuring current (100 mA) and two reversal directions of the magnetic field (+-7 T). The temperature was measured by a carbon glass thermometer.

## III Results and discussion

The x-ray diffraction patterns at room temperature (Fig. 1) show that all R0.9Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) samples have orthorhombic perovskitelike structure and contain no extra peaks due to impurity phases within the experimental error. It was indicated in the literature that only at Ca concentration does x at higher than about 0.2-0.3 impurity phases appear in bulk materials of Y1 = _x_Ca3Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ 31 Recently, Sun _et al._15 showed that for _c_-axis-oriented Y1 = _x_Ca3Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ thin films deposited by laser ablation there is no impurity phase found even for x = 0.5 and 0.7. Yakabe _et al._19 obtained single-phase Y1 = _x_Ca3Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ thin films prepared by rf thermal plasma deposition method up to 50% Ca.

The lattice parameters a, b, and c, the unit cell volume V, and the orthorhombic lattice strain e, defined as e = 2(_b_ - _a_)/(_b_ + _a_), of all samples are listed in Table 1. We observed that the structure of all studied systems remains orthorhombicity (_e_ > 0). However, the e parameter, i.e., the orthorhombicity, decreases with increasing R3+ radius (Table 1). The main peak split is not obviously for sample Nd0.9Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ (Fig. 1). The lattice parameters a, b, and c and the unit cell volume V of all samples are increasing linearly with radius of the R ion (Fig. 2). We believe that Ca2+ occupies the Y3+ site. If Ca2+ (_r__Ca_2+ = 0.99 A) occupies Ba2+ (_r__Ba_2+ = 1.34 A) sites, a shorter c axis would be expected.15 It is noticeable that the increase of the c axis from 11.615 A for  {\rm Tm}_{0.9}{\rm Ca}_{0.1}{\rm Ba}_{2}{\rm Cu}_{3}{\rm O}_{7-\delta} to 11.723 A for {\rm Nd}_{0.9}{\rm Ca}_{0.1}{\rm Ba}_{2}{\rm Cu}_{3}{\rm O}_{7-\delta} is less than that of the ionic radii from 0.87 A for {\rm Tm}^{3+} to 0.995 A for Nd^{3+}. The lattice undergoes a monotonic compression when the Y site in the 123 series is substituted by R^{3+} with a larger radius.

In fully oxygenated {\rm YBa}_{2}{\rm Cu}_{3}{\rm O}_{7-\delta} Ca doping is accompanied by a reduction in oxygen content. However, Ca doping below 6% has little effect on the oxygen content.[16] Fisher _et al.[31]_ suggested that in Ca-doped compounds {\rm Y}_{1-x}{\rm Ca}_{3}{\rm Ba}_{2}{\rm Cu}_{3}{\rm O}_{7-\delta}\delta=\delta_{0}+x/2. In our case x=0.1; therefore, we could reasonably assume that the oxygen content does not vary much.

The temperature dependences of the dc molar magnetization, M(T), of R_{0.9}{\rm Ca}_{0.1}{\rm Ba}_{2}{\rm Cu}_{3}{\rm O}_{7-\delta} (R = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) systems over the temperature region 5-90 K were measured both in zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC). The results are shown in Fig. 3. The M(T) curves demonstrate a superconducting transition.

The normal-state resistivity \rho was measured in the temperature range between T_{c} and 280 K for all samples. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The results indicate that all

  samples are ''metallic' with a linear temperature dependence in the measured temperature range.

The T_{c} values of R0.9Ca01Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ determined from both resistivity and magnetization measurements by the onset of the superconducting transition were 86, 89, 88, and 86 K for R =Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd, respectively, and exhibit an almost _R_-independent T_{c} ranging from 86 to 89 K (+-1.5 K). It should be emphasized that for Ca-doped systems in this doping level (_x_ = 0.1) no correlation of T_{c} with R3+ ion size was found. This is unlike that in Pr-doped R1-_x_PrBa2Cu3O7-_d_ systems [38, 39] in which we demonstrated an R3+ ion size effect on T_{c}. The undoped _R_Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ systems have a nearly optimal value of the carrier concentration. Then the T_{c} reduction after Ca doping could be described as an overdoping effect in the fully oxygenated samples of R0.9Ca01Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ However, Awana _et al._[32, 33] suggested an alternate explanation which involves the creation of disorder in CuO2 planes by Ca doping. They argued that in Ca-doped compounds the coordination number of Ca is dependent on the oxygen content and the concentration of doped Ca in the material.[33] The effect of disorder in reduction T_{c} should not be ignored.

It is traditional to express the total electrical resistivity as the sum of two terms. One is the temperature-dependent term arising from the dynamic deviations from crystal perfection. Another is the temperature-independent residual resistivity arising from the static imperfections, such as impurities and lattice defects. The normal-state resistivity r of R0.9Ca01Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ (_R_ = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) systems could be fitted by the relation _r_(_T_) = r0 + _a_T_, where a = _d_/_dT_ is the slope in _r_(_T_) curves and r0 is the extrapolated value of r at T = 0 and close to zero for undoped samples.

With increasing R3+ ion size, the resistivity curves _r_(_T_) are shifted progressively upwards (Fig. 4), so that the primary effect of the R ion size is to add a nominally temperature-independent contribution r0 to the transport scattering rate. This may be due to a progressive decrease in carrier concentration (our Hall measurements support this point of view) or/and a progressive increase of an unsuspected temperature-independent scattering (impurity scattering) contribution by increasing R3+ ion size in samples.

It is the most striking aspect of the normal-state resistivity data that at a constant temperature the normal-state resistivity increases linearly with increasing R3+ ion size. The experimental results for R0.9Ca01Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ (_R_ = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) systems at temperatures of 100, 150, 200, and 250 K are shown in Fig. 5. It should be also noted that in Pr-doped R0.9Pa2BaCu3O7-_d_ systems we have obtained a similar R3+-ion-size effect on r_{n}.[43, 50, 51]

Hall measurements were made with the same samples which we discussed above. Our results demonstrated that the Hall voltage V,_xy_ at a constant temperature was linear in H and no saturation up to the maximum field of 7 T.

The Hall coefficient R_{H} above T_{c} is holelike for all samples. The temperature dependence of R_{H} is shown in Fig. 6. The experimental values of R_{H} are in the range 0.3x10-9-2.0x10-9 m3/C. R_{H} increases as the temperature decreases.

It is convenient to normalize the Hall constant to the unit cell volume V (see Table I) so that, in the case of a parabolic single band, the Hall number n_{H} (derived from n_{H} = _V_/_e_R__H_) is the number of carriers per unit cell where e is the electron charge. The temperature dependence of the Hall number n_{H} is presented in Fig. 7.

As shown in Figs. 6 and 7, we find for R0.9Ca01Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ (_R_ = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) systems a nearly 1/_T_ dependence of R_{H} and therefore a nearly linear temperature dependence of n_{H}, widely seen in many high-_T__c_ cuprate superconductors.[1-19] Figure 7 also indicates that the

  slope dn_{H}/dT is found to be suppressed as the R^{3+} ionic radius increases.

The transport measurements performed in sintered bulk samples are usually complicated by the character of the granularity in these samples (weak links between grains) and confused by anisotropic effect inside the grains. In spite of this, the data of the Hall effect measurements for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} single crystals when the magnetic field is along the c axis [52, 53] are, in general, in good agreement with results on polycrystals. [54]

We have estimated that the signal error of our experimental system is about 10^{-7}\sim10^{-8} V. However, the Hall voltage V_{xy} at low temperatures is on the order of 10^{-6} V and V_{xy}\sim1/T. Above 240 K the Hall signals are small and sensitive to thermal shift during the measurements. Therefore, our Hall measurements were performed limited in the temperature range of 100-240 K.

Our experimental data show that at a constant temperature the Hall number n_{H} monotonicly decrease with increasing R^{3+} ionic radius in R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems (R =Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd). In Fig. 8 we present the correlation between 1/n_{H} and R^{3+} ion radius at constant temperatures (100, 150, 200, and 240 K). In every case the

\[1/n_{H}^{\infty  If Ca plays a role just as a carrier provider, thus, Ca doping with the same concentration (_x_ = 0.1) should generate the same number of carriers in different R0.9Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ compounds. It is not consistent with the observed R3+ ion size dependence of _nH_.

It is generally believed that the holes in the 123 compounds can be divided into two types: mobile and nonmobile. The mobile holes, which are matched with a Hall number _nH_, are located in the CuO2 sheets, others are believed to form electron-hole pairs which cannot move and are localized on the CuO chains.

In our recent paper [51] we reported detailed Hall measurements on Pr-doped R0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ systems (_R_ = Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, and Nd), in which _nH_ decreases roughly linearly with increasing R3+ ionic radius. The quite different inclination may suggest the completely different mechanisms of T_{c} suppression in Ca- and Pr-doped systems.

The variation of the carrier concentration is also expected to affect the resistivity r. In any transport model, one expects r  1/_n_. However, from Figs. 4 and 7 we can see that for a given compound both r and _nH_  T, and then, r  _nH_, instead of r  1/_n_. This fact seems to be the most puzzling in the normal-state transport properties of the high-_T__c_ cuprates: _The higher the carrier density, the smaller the conductivity_.

In Fig. 10, we present the correlation between measured r and 1/_nH_ at constant temperatures (100, 150, 200, and 240 K) for different R0.9Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ compounds. In every case, the r  1/_nH_ relation is well confirmed. This behavior is normal: _the higher the carrier density, the higher the conductivity_. Similar results were obtained in Y1-_x_CaBa2Cu3O7-_d_ systems with variable oxygen content. [16, 17] Although the parameter _nH_ interpretation in the studied systems is debatable, however, the measured _nH_ and r at fixed temperature correlates rather consistently with the r  1/_nH_ relation. This is evidence that _nH_ scales with actual mobile carrier concentration.

The Hall resistivity r_{y} and magnetic resistivity r_{x} measured in a field of 7 T are displayed in Fig. 11. The computed values of cot _thH_ = _r__xx_/_r__xy_ in the field of 7 T as a function of T2 are shown in Fig. 12. According to Anderson's suggestion [23] based on the two-dimensional Luttinger-liquid model, the Hall angle _thH_ can be expressed by a universal quadratic temperature dependence of cot _thH_ :

\[{\rm cot}\,\,\theta_{H} = \rho_{xx}/\rho_{xy} = \alpha T^{2} + C\,.\]

It should also be noted that a band model involving a square Fermi surface with rounded corners could also lead to the above T2 law. [24] Therefore, one cannot conclude the validity of Anderson's picture [23] simply based on the applicability of Eq. (3) to the observed results.

In Fig. 13, an approximate description of the R3+ ionic radius dependence of the parameter a is given by the relation

\[\alpha = 0.014 + 10^{- 4}(r_{R^{3 +}} - r_{{\rm Ca}^{2 +}})^{2}.\]

The value of 0.014 corresponds to a value of a for the compound R0.9Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ with _r__R_3+ = _r__Ca_2+. The  the temperature dependences of n_{H} and \cot\theta_{H} are suppressed for a compound with a smaller Hall carrier density (Figs. 7 and 14) or with a larger R^{3+} ionic radius (Figs. 7, 12, and 13) in R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems. We present evidence for the existence of a linear relationship between \alpha and n_{H} , which is consistent with results obtained in oxygen-depleted YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} films.^{4} The origin of this feature is not completely clear at present.

In the literature an universal behavior for all investigated films was found: The larger dn_{H}/dT, the higher T_{c}.^{17} Contrary to the Y_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} films, in our case no correlation between dn_{H}/dT and T_{c} was found in R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems.

Earlier Hall measurements [3, 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13] on 123-type high-T_{c} superconductors reveal that Eq. (3) seems to be universal in every system with different dopants and doping levels. However, the behavior of the slope \alpha and intercept C are quite different for different systems.

For the case of in-plane zinc dopants in crystals of YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{7-\delta}[11]C in Eq. (3) linearly increases with increasing zinc concentration, but the parameter \alpha is essentially unchanged. For the case of CuO-chain-site cobalt doping in crystals of YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{3}O_{7-\delta}[13] the results showed that doping with Co decreases \alpha while leaving the residual scattering parameter C unchanged. For the case of oxygen-deficient YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} epitaxial films,^{5} the results showed that oxygen reduction increases \alpha, leaving the residual scattering parameter C unchanged. For the case of Y-site doping by Pr in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} epitaxial films,^{5} both \alpha and C increase with Pr concentration x.

All of the Hall experiments above^{3/4,8,10-13} reveal a unified picture of the Hall effect in various high-T_{c} cuprate systems. While the increase of C corresponds to a reduction of mobility, the change of \alpha reflects the variation in carrier density.^{5}

All of the Hall experiments above^{3,4,8,10-13} have focused on the change of the concentration x of the dopants or the oxygen reduction \delta. In our previous paper,^{51} we presented Hall measurements in R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems and, in the present paper, in R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems, in which, instead of a change of concentration, we change the R^{3+} ion while leaving the concentration of Pr or Ca unchanged.

In Pr-doped R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems, both parameters \alpha and C, in the formula cut \theta_{H}= \rho_{xx}/\rho_{xy}= \alpha T^{2}+ C, remain almost constant and do not change with the changing

  of R in R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}[51]. However, in present Ca-doped R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems, similar to the case of Co-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{1-x}Co_{x}_{3}O_{7-\delta} crystals,[13] the results showed that changing the R ion with a larger ion size [as increasing the Co concentration x in YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{3}O_{7-\delta} crystals[13] decreases \alpha, while leaving the residual scattering parameter C unchanged (Fig. 12).

In a unified picture of Hall effect as mentioned above, the parameter C is a measure of the in-plane impurity scattering rate. It is not surprising that C, independent of the R^{3+} ion, substituted into the Y R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} and R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems.

The change of \alpha was attributed to the variation in the carrier density.[5] It is not surprising that \alpha and n_{H} have a similar R^{3+}-ion-size dependence [see Eqs. (2) and (4)], indicating that both effects are closely related.

The observed R^{3+}-ion-size dependence of the Hall number n_{H} in bulk R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems (R = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) at a fixed Ca concentration (x = 0.1) presented here reveals that the change of number of the mobile holes in these systems is not only connected to the hole generation by the substitution of Ca^{2+}, but also to the "moving holes" localization caused by disorder and lattice compression. The Ca content controls the carrier density in a nonlinear fashion because carriers are distributed both in the CuO_{2} planes and in the CuO chains. The part of the carriers brought about by Ca doping, most probably, is absorbed into the CuO chain charge reservoir. The localization and charge transfer are the major factors affecting the hole concentration in Ca-doped systems.

As mentioned earlier, the lattice of R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems (R = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) compounds undergoes a monotonic compression when the Y site in the 123 series is substituted by R^{3+} with a larger radius. The lattice compression turn leads to the localization of the mobile holes generated by Ca doping. This excess strain due to the lattice compression in these compounds with a larger R^{3+} ion size, though having little effect on T_{c} , has a strong influence on the resistivity and Hall effect. The effect of the disorder influence on transport properties should not be ignored.

Another possible reason for the R^{3+}-ion-size effect on n_{H} is that the coordination number of the doped Ca[33, 34] which has a strong effect on the hole generation, is R^{3+}-ion-size dependent.

## IV Conclusions

In conclusion, we find a linear temperature dependence of the normal-state resistivity \rho_{n} and the Hall number n_{H} in bulk R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems (R = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd). At a constant temperature \rho_{n} and 1/n_{H} are linearly dependent on the ion size of the rare earth. The \rho \propto 1/n relation is well confirmed at a constant temperature for R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} compounds with different R ions. The cotangent of the Hall angle follows a universal T^{2} dependence. The slope \alpha decreases with increasing ion size of the rare earth, but the quantity C is insensitive to the R ion and remains almost constant. Our experimental results reveal that Ca doping plays a much more interesting role than just of a carrier provider in RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems. A considerably stronger decreasing of the n_{H} value in R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} compounds as the R^{3+} ion radius rises can be attributed to the strengthening of the localization effect due to the disorder and lattice compression related to Ca doping.

###### Abstract

We report detailed studies of the normal-state resistivity and Hall effect in bulk R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems (R =Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd). We find a linear temperature dependence of the normal-state resistivity \rho_{n} (\rho_{n}\proptoT) and the Hall number n_{H} (n_{H}\proptoT) above T_{c}. For a fixed temperature both \rho_{n} and n_{H} are dependent on the ionic radius of the rare earth r_{B^{3+}}; viz., the larger the R^{3+} ionic radius, the larger \rho_{n} (\rho_{n}\proptor_{B^{3+}}), but the lower n_{H} (n_{H}\propto1/r_{B^{3+}}). At a constant temperature the \rho_{n}\propto1/n_{H} relation is well confirmed for R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} compounds with different R ions. The cotangent of the Hall angle follows a universal T^{2} dependence i.e., cot \theta_{H}= \alphaT^{2}+ C. The slope \alpha decreases with increasing ion size of the rare earth, but the quantity C remains almost constant for R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} compounds with different R. The reduction of T_{c} and the R^{3+} ion-size dependence of \rho_{n} and n_{H} is interpreted in terms of hole generation and hole localization by Ca doping. [S0163-1829(96)04129-X]

## I Introduction

One of the most puzzling problems in the study of high-T_{c} superconductors has been the anomalous linear temperature dependence of their normal-state resistivity \rho_{n} and the Hall number n_{H} above T_{c} over a wide temperature range,[1] which is inconsistent with an isotropic single-band Fermi-liquid description. A complete understanding of these properties is still lacking.

In an isotropic parabolic single-band Fermi-liquid system, the Hall number n_{H}= V/eR_{H} would be the number of carriers per unit cell. For the high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors, due to its T dependence and the complex band structure, n_{H} may not represent the actual carrier concentration. However, the value of n_{H} at a particular T correlates rather consistently with the carrier concentration determined by other methods. n_{H} scales with the actual carrier concentration.

In any transport model, one expects that the carrier concentration scales with the conductivity, namely, \rho\propto1/n. However, for most of the high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors, both \rho and n_{H}\proptoT, and, then, \rho\propton_{H} instead of \rho\propto1/n in the simple Drude model. This fact seems to be the most puzzling in the normal-state transport properties of the high-T_{c} cuprates: _The higher the carrier density, the smaller the conductivity_.

Extensive studies of the Hall effect have been carried out on following 123 systems: (1) YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} with changing the oxygen content \delta^{2-8} (2) Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} with changing the Pr content x,[9,10] (3) YBa_{2}Cu_{3-x}M_{x}O_{7-\delta} (M =Zn, Co, Fe) with changing the transition-metal content x[11, 12, 13, 14] and (4) Y_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} with changing the Ca content x and the oxygen content \delta.[15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

In order to explain the unusual temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient in the normal state of high-T_{c} superconductors, several approaches have been suggested, including conventional band-structure calculations[20] and strongly correlated models,[21, 22] A non-Fermi-liquid-based approach has been suggested by Anderson[23] and a band model involving a square Fermi surface with rounded corners has been suggested by Pickett _et al.[24]_ to understand the Hall-effect 'puzzle' in high-T_{c} superconductors. Alexandrov _et al.[25]_ showed that a quantitative explanation is possible for the temperature dependence of the R_{H} and resistivity using a variation of the bipolaron theory which takes into account Anderson localization of the bosons by disorder.

Among all cation dopings, Ca substitution for Y in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} has received much attention.[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32] The valence state of Ca^{2+} is lower than that of Y^{3+}; such a substitution will generate excess holes and T_{c} is suppressed by the overdoping effect. On the other hand, it has been known that Ca doping is likely to coinproduce oxygen vacancies and this effect reduces the number of generated holes. This indicates that doping with Ca has a counterbalance effect on the suppression of the T_{c}. Ca doping is able to increase the T_{c} of the oxygen-deficient and tetragonal Y-Bu-Cu-O samples.[18, 33] Recently, Yakabe _et al.[19]_ showed that there is a maximum T_{c} of about 90 K with variation of the carrier density in single-phase Y_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin films up to 50% Ca concentration. The value of the maximum T_{c} is independent of Ca concentration.

Ca doping is able to revive the superconductivity (to T_{c}\sim 40 K) of PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, which is a semiconductor.[34, 35] Also, the introduction of Ca will increase T_{c} from 0 to about 82 K in YBa_{2}Cu_{2.64}Co_{0.36}O_{7-\delta}[36] Gnansekar _et al.[37]_ reported that they prepared thin films of M_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (M =Lu, Tb, Th) in single phase. The superconducting transition temperature of the films varies from \approx12 to \approx45 K. The significance is that the composition MBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (M =Lu, Tb, Th) does not form in single phase in bulk form and, in the case of Tb and Th, not even in thin film form.

All of the Hall experiments above[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] have focused on the change of the concentration x of the dopants or the oxygen reduction \delta. As a modification of our previous observation that the R^{3+} ion size has a very strong effect on supercon  ducting and magnetic properties in R1 = _x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_

 we have carried out transport measurements in R0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ systems,51 in which instead of a change of concentration, we change the R3+ ion while leaving the concentration of Pr and oxygen unchanged. We found that at a constant temperature both r_{n} and n_{H} are linearly dependent on the ion size of the rare earth, viz., the larger the R3+ ionic radius, the larger r_{n} , but the lower n_{H} . The cotangent of the Hall angle follows a universal T2 dependence, i.e., cot _th__H_ = _a_T_2+ C. Both the slope a and the quantity C are insensitive to the R ion and remain almost constant. On the basis of our data we proposed a _T__c_-_n__H_ diagram which manifests an "underdoping" behavior of R0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ systems.51

In this paper we report detailed studies of the normal-state resistivity and the Hall effect of bulk Y0.5Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ systems (_R_ = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) in which instead of a change of concentration, we change the R3+ ion while leaving the concentration of Ca (_x_ = 0.1) unchanged. We found that at a constant temperature both r_{n} and n_{H} are dependent on the ionic radius of the rare earth, _r__R_3+, viz., the larger R3+ ionic radius, the larger r_{n} (_r__n__H_ = _a_T_/_r__R_3+). For a fixed temperature the relation of r  1/_n__H_ is well confirmed for R0.9Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ systems with different R ions. _The higher the carrier density, the higher the conductivity_. The cotangent of the Hall angle follows a universal T2 dependence, namely, cot _th_ = _a_T_2+ C. The slope a decreases with increasing ion size of the rare earth, but the quantity C remains almost constant for R0.9Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ compounds with different R ions.

## II Experimental techniques

The ceramic R0.9Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ (_R_ = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) samples were synthesized using a conventional solid-state reaction method. Stoichiometric amounts of high-purity R2O3 (_R_ = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd), BaCO3, CaCO3, and CuO powders were mixed, ground, and calcined at 915 degC for about 24 h in air in Al2O3 crucibles, followed by a slow cooling in the furnace. The resultant powder was then reground again and pressed with about 4 tons/cm2 into pellets, which was then heated at 925-935 degC for 3 days in flowing oxygen, followed by annealing at 680 degC for 10 h, and then slow cooled to 420 degC, where they remained for 20 h before a final slow cool to room temperature. All specimens were annealed in an atmosphere of flowing oxygen to ensure a sufficient oxygen content in the final product. This sinter procedure was repeated at least three times. All samples were prepared at the same time in the same furnace, respectively, to ensure the same sample qualities.

The structures of the samples were investigated using a Rigaku Rotaflex rotating anode powder x-ray diffractometer (Cu _K_a radiation).

The dc magnetization was measured by a Quantum Design magnetometer. The resistivity was measured by the standard four-probe technique. To measure the Hall effect and the longitudinal resistivity a five-probe arrangement was used on rectangular-shaped samples. The rectangular samples were cut from sintered pellets with typical dimensions 2x5x0.5 mm3. In order to perform precise Hall measurements, it was essential to minimize the misalignment of the Hall arms and also to achieve low contact resistance. The contacts were made using gold wires and silver epoxy. After a heat treatment of 2 h at 450 degC in flowing oxygen, the contact resistance was typically less than 0.5 O for contact surfaces smaller than 0.1 mm2. Samples were mounted on small sapphire substrates.

The experiments were performed in a commercial Oxford Dewar with a superconducting magnet. To extract the Hall voltage, a signal was measured at two reversal directions of the measuring current (100 mA) and two reversal directions of the magnetic field (+-7 T). The temperature was measured by a carbon glass thermometer.

## III Results and discussion

The x-ray diffraction patterns at room temperature (Fig. 1) show that all R0.9Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) samples have orthorhombic perovskitelike structure and contain no extra peaks due to impurity phases within the experimental error. It was indicated in the literature that only at Ca concentration does x at higher than about 0.2-0.3 impurity phases appear in bulk materials of Y1 = _x_Ca3Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ 31 Recently, Sun _et al._15 showed that for _c_-axis-oriented Y1 = _x_Ca3Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ thin films deposited by laser ablation there is no impurity phase found even for x = 0.5 and 0.7. Yakabe _et al._19 obtained single-phase Y1 = _x_Ca3Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ thin films prepared by rf thermal plasma deposition method up to 50% Ca.

The lattice parameters a, b, and c, the unit cell volume V, and the orthorhombic lattice strain e, defined as e = 2(_b_ - _a_)/(_b_ + _a_), of all samples are listed in Table 1. We observed that the structure of all studied systems remains orthorhombicity (_e_ > 0). However, the e parameter, i.e., the orthorhombicity, decreases with increasing R3+ radius (Table 1). The main peak split is not obviously for sample Nd0.9Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7 = _x_-ph_ (Fig. 1). The lattice parameters a, b, and c and the unit cell volume V of all samples are increasing linearly with radius of the R ion (Fig. 2). We believe that Ca2+ occupies the Y3+ site. If Ca2+ (_r__Ca_2+ = 0.99 A) occupies Ba2+ (_r__Ba_2+ = 1.34 A) sites, a shorter c axis would be expected.15 It is noticeable that the increase of the c axis from 11.615 A for  {\rm Tm}_{0.9}{\rm Ca}_{0.1}{\rm Ba}_{2}{\rm Cu}_{3}{\rm O}_{7-\delta} to 11.723 A for {\rm Nd}_{0.9}{\rm Ca}_{0.1}{\rm Ba}_{2}{\rm Cu}_{3}{\rm O}_{7-\delta} is less than that of the ionic radii from 0.87 A for {\rm Tm}^{3+} to 0.995 A for Nd^{3+}. The lattice undergoes a monotonic compression when the Y site in the 123 series is substituted by R^{3+} with a larger radius.

In fully oxygenated {\rm YBa}_{2}{\rm Cu}_{3}{\rm O}_{7-\delta} Ca doping is accompanied by a reduction in oxygen content. However, Ca doping below 6% has little effect on the oxygen content.[16] Fisher _et al.[31]_ suggested that in Ca-doped compounds {\rm Y}_{1-x}{\rm Ca}_{3}{\rm Ba}_{2}{\rm Cu}_{3}{\rm O}_{7-\delta}\delta=\delta_{0}+x/2. In our case x=0.1; therefore, we could reasonably assume that the oxygen content does not vary much.

The temperature dependences of the dc molar magnetization, M(T), of R_{0.9}{\rm Ca}_{0.1}{\rm Ba}_{2}{\rm Cu}_{3}{\rm O}_{7-\delta} (R = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) systems over the temperature region 5-90 K were measured both in zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC). The results are shown in Fig. 3. The M(T) curves demonstrate a superconducting transition.

The normal-state resistivity \rho was measured in the temperature range between T_{c} and 280 K for all samples. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The results indicate that all

  samples are ''metallic' with a linear temperature dependence in the measured temperature range.

The T_{c} values of R0.9Ca01Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ determined from both resistivity and magnetization measurements by the onset of the superconducting transition were 86, 89, 88, and 86 K for R =Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd, respectively, and exhibit an almost _R_-independent T_{c} ranging from 86 to 89 K (+-1.5 K). It should be emphasized that for Ca-doped systems in this doping level (_x_ = 0.1) no correlation of T_{c} with R3+ ion size was found. This is unlike that in Pr-doped R1-_x_PrBa2Cu3O7-_d_ systems [38, 39] in which we demonstrated an R3+ ion size effect on T_{c}. The undoped _R_Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ systems have a nearly optimal value of the carrier concentration. Then the T_{c} reduction after Ca doping could be described as an overdoping effect in the fully oxygenated samples of R0.9Ca01Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ However, Awana _et al._[32, 33] suggested an alternate explanation which involves the creation of disorder in CuO2 planes by Ca doping. They argued that in Ca-doped compounds the coordination number of Ca is dependent on the oxygen content and the concentration of doped Ca in the material.[33] The effect of disorder in reduction T_{c} should not be ignored.

It is traditional to express the total electrical resistivity as the sum of two terms. One is the temperature-dependent term arising from the dynamic deviations from crystal perfection. Another is the temperature-independent residual resistivity arising from the static imperfections, such as impurities and lattice defects. The normal-state resistivity r of R0.9Ca01Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ (_R_ = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) systems could be fitted by the relation _r_(_T_) = r0 + _a_T_, where a = _d_/_dT_ is the slope in _r_(_T_) curves and r0 is the extrapolated value of r at T = 0 and close to zero for undoped samples.

With increasing R3+ ion size, the resistivity curves _r_(_T_) are shifted progressively upwards (Fig. 4), so that the primary effect of the R ion size is to add a nominally temperature-independent contribution r0 to the transport scattering rate. This may be due to a progressive decrease in carrier concentration (our Hall measurements support this point of view) or/and a progressive increase of an unsuspected temperature-independent scattering (impurity scattering) contribution by increasing R3+ ion size in samples.

It is the most striking aspect of the normal-state resistivity data that at a constant temperature the normal-state resistivity increases linearly with increasing R3+ ion size. The experimental results for R0.9Ca01Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ (_R_ = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) systems at temperatures of 100, 150, 200, and 250 K are shown in Fig. 5. It should be also noted that in Pr-doped R0.9Pa2BaCu3O7-_d_ systems we have obtained a similar R3+-ion-size effect on r_{n}.[43, 50, 51]

Hall measurements were made with the same samples which we discussed above. Our results demonstrated that the Hall voltage V,_xy_ at a constant temperature was linear in H and no saturation up to the maximum field of 7 T.

The Hall coefficient R_{H} above T_{c} is holelike for all samples. The temperature dependence of R_{H} is shown in Fig. 6. The experimental values of R_{H} are in the range 0.3x10-9-2.0x10-9 m3/C. R_{H} increases as the temperature decreases.

It is convenient to normalize the Hall constant to the unit cell volume V (see Table I) so that, in the case of a parabolic single band, the Hall number n_{H} (derived from n_{H} = _V_/_e_R__H_) is the number of carriers per unit cell where e is the electron charge. The temperature dependence of the Hall number n_{H} is presented in Fig. 7.

As shown in Figs. 6 and 7, we find for R0.9Ca01Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ (_R_ = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) systems a nearly 1/_T_ dependence of R_{H} and therefore a nearly linear temperature dependence of n_{H}, widely seen in many high-_T__c_ cuprate superconductors.[1-19] Figure 7 also indicates that the

  slope dn_{H}/dT is found to be suppressed as the R^{3+} ionic radius increases.

The transport measurements performed in sintered bulk samples are usually complicated by the character of the granularity in these samples (weak links between grains) and confused by anisotropic effect inside the grains. In spite of this, the data of the Hall effect measurements for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} single crystals when the magnetic field is along the c axis [52, 53] are, in general, in good agreement with results on polycrystals. [54]

We have estimated that the signal error of our experimental system is about 10^{-7}\sim10^{-8} V. However, the Hall voltage V_{xy} at low temperatures is on the order of 10^{-6} V and V_{xy}\sim1/T. Above 240 K the Hall signals are small and sensitive to thermal shift during the measurements. Therefore, our Hall measurements were performed limited in the temperature range of 100-240 K.

Our experimental data show that at a constant temperature the Hall number n_{H} monotonicly decrease with increasing R^{3+} ionic radius in R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems (R =Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd). In Fig. 8 we present the correlation between 1/n_{H} and R^{3+} ion radius at constant temperatures (100, 150, 200, and 240 K). In every case the

\[1/n_{H}^{\infty  If Ca plays a role just as a carrier provider, thus, Ca doping with the same concentration (_x_ = 0.1) should generate the same number of carriers in different R0.9Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ compounds. It is not consistent with the observed R3+ ion size dependence of _nH_.

It is generally believed that the holes in the 123 compounds can be divided into two types: mobile and nonmobile. The mobile holes, which are matched with a Hall number _nH_, are located in the CuO2 sheets, others are believed to form electron-hole pairs which cannot move and are localized on the CuO chains.

In our recent paper [51] we reported detailed Hall measurements on Pr-doped R0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ systems (_R_ = Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, and Nd), in which _nH_ decreases roughly linearly with increasing R3+ ionic radius. The quite different inclination may suggest the completely different mechanisms of T_{c} suppression in Ca- and Pr-doped systems.

The variation of the carrier concentration is also expected to affect the resistivity r. In any transport model, one expects r  1/_n_. However, from Figs. 4 and 7 we can see that for a given compound both r and _nH_  T, and then, r  _nH_, instead of r  1/_n_. This fact seems to be the most puzzling in the normal-state transport properties of the high-_T__c_ cuprates: _The higher the carrier density, the smaller the conductivity_.

In Fig. 10, we present the correlation between measured r and 1/_nH_ at constant temperatures (100, 150, 200, and 240 K) for different R0.9Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ compounds. In every case, the r  1/_nH_ relation is well confirmed. This behavior is normal: _the higher the carrier density, the higher the conductivity_. Similar results were obtained in Y1-_x_CaBa2Cu3O7-_d_ systems with variable oxygen content. [16, 17] Although the parameter _nH_ interpretation in the studied systems is debatable, however, the measured _nH_ and r at fixed temperature correlates rather consistently with the r  1/_nH_ relation. This is evidence that _nH_ scales with actual mobile carrier concentration.

The Hall resistivity r_{y} and magnetic resistivity r_{x} measured in a field of 7 T are displayed in Fig. 11. The computed values of cot _thH_ = _r__xx_/_r__xy_ in the field of 7 T as a function of T2 are shown in Fig. 12. According to Anderson's suggestion [23] based on the two-dimensional Luttinger-liquid model, the Hall angle _thH_ can be expressed by a universal quadratic temperature dependence of cot _thH_ :

\[{\rm cot}\,\,\theta_{H} = \rho_{xx}/\rho_{xy} = \alpha T^{2} + C\,.\]

It should also be noted that a band model involving a square Fermi surface with rounded corners could also lead to the above T2 law. [24] Therefore, one cannot conclude the validity of Anderson's picture [23] simply based on the applicability of Eq. (3) to the observed results.

In Fig. 13, an approximate description of the R3+ ionic radius dependence of the parameter a is given by the relation

\[\alpha = 0.014 + 10^{- 4}(r_{R^{3 +}} - r_{{\rm Ca}^{2 +}})^{2}.\]

The value of 0.014 corresponds to a value of a for the compound R0.9Ca0.1Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ with _r__R_3+ = _r__Ca_2+. The  the temperature dependences of n_{H} and \cot\theta_{H} are suppressed for a compound with a smaller Hall carrier density (Figs. 7 and 14) or with a larger R^{3+} ionic radius (Figs. 7, 12, and 13) in R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems. We present evidence for the existence of a linear relationship between \alpha and n_{H} , which is consistent with results obtained in oxygen-depleted YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} films.^{4} The origin of this feature is not completely clear at present.

In the literature an universal behavior for all investigated films was found: The larger dn_{H}/dT, the higher T_{c}.^{17} Contrary to the Y_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} films, in our case no correlation between dn_{H}/dT and T_{c} was found in R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems.

Earlier Hall measurements [3, 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13] on 123-type high-T_{c} superconductors reveal that Eq. (3) seems to be universal in every system with different dopants and doping levels. However, the behavior of the slope \alpha and intercept C are quite different for different systems.

For the case of in-plane zinc dopants in crystals of YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{7-\delta}[11]C in Eq. (3) linearly increases with increasing zinc concentration, but the parameter \alpha is essentially unchanged. For the case of CuO-chain-site cobalt doping in crystals of YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{3}O_{7-\delta}[13] the results showed that doping with Co decreases \alpha while leaving the residual scattering parameter C unchanged. For the case of oxygen-deficient YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} epitaxial films,^{5} the results showed that oxygen reduction increases \alpha, leaving the residual scattering parameter C unchanged. For the case of Y-site doping by Pr in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} epitaxial films,^{5} both \alpha and C increase with Pr concentration x.

All of the Hall experiments above^{3/4,8,10-13} reveal a unified picture of the Hall effect in various high-T_{c} cuprate systems. While the increase of C corresponds to a reduction of mobility, the change of \alpha reflects the variation in carrier density.^{5}

All of the Hall experiments above^{3,4,8,10-13} have focused on the change of the concentration x of the dopants or the oxygen reduction \delta. In our previous paper,^{51} we presented Hall measurements in R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems and, in the present paper, in R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems, in which, instead of a change of concentration, we change the R^{3+} ion while leaving the concentration of Pr or Ca unchanged.

In Pr-doped R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems, both parameters \alpha and C, in the formula cut \theta_{H}= \rho_{xx}/\rho_{xy}= \alpha T^{2}+ C, remain almost constant and do not change with the changing

  of R in R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}[51]. However, in present Ca-doped R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems, similar to the case of Co-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{1-x}Co_{x}_{3}O_{7-\delta} crystals,[13] the results showed that changing the R ion with a larger ion size [as increasing the Co concentration x in YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{3}O_{7-\delta} crystals[13] decreases \alpha, while leaving the residual scattering parameter C unchanged (Fig. 12).

In a unified picture of Hall effect as mentioned above, the parameter C is a measure of the in-plane impurity scattering rate. It is not surprising that C, independent of the R^{3+} ion, substituted into the Y R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} and R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems.

The change of \alpha was attributed to the variation in the carrier density.[5] It is not surprising that \alpha and n_{H} have a similar R^{3+}-ion-size dependence [see Eqs. (2) and (4)], indicating that both effects are closely related.

The observed R^{3+}-ion-size dependence of the Hall number n_{H} in bulk R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems (R = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) at a fixed Ca concentration (x = 0.1) presented here reveals that the change of number of the mobile holes in these systems is not only connected to the hole generation by the substitution of Ca^{2+}, but also to the "moving holes" localization caused by disorder and lattice compression. The Ca content controls the carrier density in a nonlinear fashion because carriers are distributed both in the CuO_{2} planes and in the CuO chains. The part of the carriers brought about by Ca doping, most probably, is absorbed into the CuO chain charge reservoir. The localization and charge transfer are the major factors affecting the hole concentration in Ca-doped systems.

As mentioned earlier, the lattice of R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems (R = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) compounds undergoes a monotonic compression when the Y site in the 123 series is substituted by R^{3+} with a larger radius. The lattice compression turn leads to the localization of the mobile holes generated by Ca doping. This excess strain due to the lattice compression in these compounds with a larger R^{3+} ion size, though having little effect on T_{c} , has a strong influence on the resistivity and Hall effect. The effect of the disorder influence on transport properties should not be ignored.

Another possible reason for the R^{3+}-ion-size effect on n_{H} is that the coordination number of the doped Ca[33, 34] which has a strong effect on the hole generation, is R^{3+}-ion-size dependent.

## IV Conclusions

In conclusion, we find a linear temperature dependence of the normal-state resistivity \rho_{n} and the Hall number n_{H} in bulk R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems (R = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd). At a constant temperature \rho_{n} and 1/n_{H} are linearly dependent on the ion size of the rare earth. The \rho \propto 1/n relation is well confirmed at a constant temperature for R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} compounds with different R ions. The cotangent of the Hall angle follows a universal T^{2} dependence. The slope \alpha decreases with increasing ion size of the rare earth, but the quantity C is insensitive to the R ion and remains almost constant. Our experimental results reveal that Ca doping plays a much more interesting role than just of a carrier provider in RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} systems. A considerably stronger decreasing of the n_{H} value in R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} compounds as the R^{3+} ion radius rises can be attributed to the strengthening of the localization effect due to the disorder and lattice compression related to Ca doping.
