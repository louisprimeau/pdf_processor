###### Abstract

Normal-state properties, such as the resistivity \rho_{ab} and the Hall coefficient R_{H}, structural properties, such as the c axis and in-plane lattice parameters, and superconductive properties, such as the critical temperature T_{c}, the penetration depth \lambda_{ab}, and the thermal activation energy for flux flow \Delta\,U, are reported for c-axis La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4\pm\delta} films. These parameters have been measured as a function of doping in the range from heavily underdoped to heavily overdoped. The structural data indicate a 0.3% compression of the c-axis parameter and a corresponding 0.3% expansion of the in-plane lattice parameters as compared to bulk values, which explains the overall reduced critical temperature of these thin films. As the dopant content is increased, maximum values for T_{c}, \Delta U, and \lambda_{ab}^{-1} are observed close to optimum doping, while R_{H} and \rho_{ab} decrease monotonically.

## 1 Introduction

It is of fundamental importance to establish the doping (_x_) dependence of the superconducting properties in cuprate superconductors. Of particular relevance are the phase-transition line T_{c}(x), which distinguishes the normal from the superconducting state, and the penetration depth \lambda(x). Indeed a maximum T_{c} is observed for "optimum" doping, with a decrease in both the underdoped and overdoped regimes. The penetration depth \lambda characterizes the appearance of the Meissner state, and its "true" doping dependence is currently a topic of considerable debate.[1, 2, 3, 4] On the other hand, from a phase-transition point of view, an analysis of thermal fluctuations points to three-dimensional (3D) _xy_ critical behavior, which leads to a relation between the specific-heat singularity, \lambda and T_{c}, and predicts an increase of \lambda in the overdoped regime, _independent of any microscopic mechanism of superconductivity_.[5] Recent work on overdoped Tl compounds[1, 2] and overdoped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} "123" compounds[6] appears to confirm these predictions.

In this paper we report careful measurements of various properties on c-axis La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} ('214") thin films, covering the doping regime from heavily underdoped to heavily overdoped. Particular attention was given to the preparation of _high-quality, homogeneous films_. First, the normal-state properties, such as the Hall coefficient R_{H} and the in-plane resistivity \rho_{ab}, are obtained as a function of doping; they allow an estimate of the mean free path l. Second, the evolution of the structural properties is reported as a function of doping and thickness. Then the thermal activation energy for flux flow, \Delta\,U -- related to \lambda -- is derived from \rho_{ab}(T) measurements in a magnetic field close to T_{c}. Finally, the in-plane penetration depth \lambda_{ab} is obtained directly from the kinetic inductance L_{K} for the same samples. About 20 samples have been characterized, and this work represents the most complete study of the behavior of \lambda from the heavily underdoped to the heavily overdoped regime to date.

The original Sr-doped La_{2}CuO_{4} compound[7] is an attrac  tive material for such a study, as it supports "bulk" and homogeneous superconductivity over a large range of doping as recently demonstrated.[8, 9] The preparation of "bulk" homogeneous "214" samples is tedious (particularly in the overdoped regime), owing to the very slow Sr incorporation into the easily formed undoped 214 lattice during solid-state sintering at the standard temperatures (more than 100 h are necessary for sintering at 900 degC).[9] This effect and the resulting "chemical phase separation" could well explain Uemura's early results[3] as well as the claims that superconductivity is restricted to a narrow composition range.[10, 11] From a sample-preparation point of view, the thin-film growth process is ideal for avoiding the occurrence of chemical phase separation. The growth process is mostly 2D, as films with large and atomically flat surfaces (\mum size) can easily be obtained.[12] This indicates that the surface diffusion coefficients are certainly large enough to ensure a homogeneous Sr distribution. The films used here were grown on SrTiO3 using sequential molecular-beam deposition; the deposition details and the overall structural properties of the films have been published elsewhere.[12, 13] Briefly, x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed single-phase and _c_-axis single-crystal films with a surface roughness of about one unit cell (over 1 \mum^{2}) and a microstructure that is essentially free of the usual defects observed in high-T_{c} cuprate films, such as secondary phase inclusions, _a_-axis inclusions, grain and/or twin boundaries. Strong chemical inhomogeneity, such as that induced by large-scale Sr clustering, can be observed using TEM.[13] However during the TEM investigations of the films, no evidence of such behavior was found in the entire doping range studied.

## II Normal-state properties

The normal-state properties \rho^{-1} and R_{H}^{-1} obtained at 100 K using standard four-point and Hall-effect measurements are summarized in Fig. 1 as a function of doping. For both quantities a _monotonic increase_ is observed with increasing Sr content. They are in _excellent agreement_ with literature data of other thin films on SrTiO3 having a comparable thickness, although single crystals and thicker films show reduced resistivities (\approx20-30 %).[14, 15, 16, 17] Higher resistivity values are typically taken as evidence of poor sample quality. On the other hand, the resistance ratio (\rho_{300} k/\rho_{50} k) is also a good indicator for the quality of the thin films, and values between 3.3 and 3.5 were obtained for the optimally doped films. These values are as good as or better than those cited for the best films or single crystals reported so far, indicating a similar sample quality.[17] This apparent contradiction originates from a residual in-plane tensile stress, which expands the in-plane lattice constants and increases the resistivity to \approx20-30 %. A quantitative argumentation is given below. We used the published R_{H}^{-1} values as a calibration curve to correct the experimental uncertainty (\approx10%) in the Sr content of our films.

Models must be used to relate \rho^{-1} and R_{H}^{-1} to the carrier density n, and only the simplest ones predict a direct proportionality, \rho^{-1}\propton and R_{H}^{-1}\propton. Although more elaborate models could modify these predictions, we expect that \rho^{-1} and R_{H}^{-1} increase with n. Therefore our data suggest that the carrier density increases with Sr doping. Further evidence of this comes from normal-state measurements of the Cu spin-lattice-relaxation rate, the magnetic shift and the spin susceptibility obtained from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on this compound[18] as well as on overdoped YBa2Cu3O7 (Ref. [19]) and Tl2Ba2CuO6.[20, 21] These _independent_ measurements clearly suggest that an increase in the Sr content indeed increases n.

## III Structural properties

While the normal-state properties are in excellent agreement with literature values, there is a significant difference between the lattice parameters of 214 thin films on SrTiO3 and those of the bulk 214. From \theta-2 \theta x-ray-diffraction experiments, the value of the _c_-axis lattice parameter can be derived and is shown in Fig. 2 as a function of Sr content for our thin and thick films as well as for bulk samples.[22] These data are in very good agreement with those recently reported for laser-ablated 214 thin films on SrTiO3.[23] Although there is an experimental error (\pm 0.01 A) in the determination of the _c_-axis lattice parameter for the thin films, a comparison between the data of films and bulk material indicates an average difference of \simeq 0.045 A, i.e., a contraction of about 0.35%. To compress the bulk 214 lattice to such an extent along the c axis, a pressure of 1.6-2.2 GPa (depending on Sr doping) would be necessary under _hydrostatic_ conditions.[24]

There are two possible origins for this difference in lattice parameters. First, it is well documented that an oxygen deficiency in the 214 lattice gives rise to a reduced _c_-axis lattice parameter. This possibility can be excluded, as the samples are cooled under a flow of atomic oxygen that is sufficiently powerful to fill even some interstitial oxygen sites and that can induce superconductivity at 32 K in 214 thin films prepared without Sr, (La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta}).[32] In addition, a post-annealing of these films in an oxygen atmosphere at

Figure 1: Inverse resistivity (‚óè) and inverse Hall coefficient (‚ñ†) at 100 K versus Sr concentration.

  700 degC for 24 h does not significantly change the lattice parameters. The second possibility is related to the in-plane lattice parameter difference between SrTiO3 (3.9 A) and 214 (3.8 A). The 2.5% larger in-plane lattice parameter of the substrate could be partially responsible for the film in-plane lattice parameter extension, which would induce a shorter c-axis lattice parameter. During thin film growth such a large discrepancy between lattice parameters is usually accommodated by the appearance of misfit dislocations (for thicknesses larger than the critical thickness). For our 214 thin films, we have shown[13] that a regular network of misfit dislocations exists that accommodates "most" of the lattice misfit.

To find out whether the lattice misfit is completely accommodated by the creation of misfit dislocations, we have performed a detailed analysis of _in-situ_ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) spectra recorded during the deposition of an undoped 214 film on SrTiO3 at 750 degC. The RHEED images of the film present a series of long streaks at regular spacings, characteristic of two-dimensional growth.[12] Line scans taken across such spectra show a series of peaks that have been fitted using the Phexagon VII peak profile. From the peak positions the in-plane lattice parameter can be estimated _in principle_ with an accuracy of \approx 0.01 A. However to obtain an accurate absolute value the precise geometrical diffraction conditions must be known. Minute geometrical changes of the sample manipulator during a temperature ramp currently prevent a measurement of the lattice parameters as a function of the temperature. Hence such a precision can only be maintained for a comparison under identical conditions (such as during growth). A more detailed report of this method and the analysis of the _in-situ_ RHEED data is in preparation.[25]

To calibrate the vertical axis of Fig. 3 precisely we have used the lattice parameter of the substrate but extrapolated to 750 degC by using literature values of the thermal-expansion coefficients (\alpha) of SrTiO3 and 214. For SrTiO3, \alpha\!=\!11\!\times\!10^{-6}/K,[26] which gives a d_{[100]} spacing of 3.937 A. The only data we found regarding the thermal expansion of undoped 214 at temperatures much above the orthorhombic-tetragonal phase-transition temperature are given in Ref. [27], namely, \alpha\!=\!8.5\!\times\!10^{-6}/K and a d_{[100]} spacing of 3.826 A.

The evolution of the [100] and [110] lattice parameters is shown in Fig. 3 as a function of the number of unit cells deposited. The extrapolated bulk 214 values (3.826 and 2.703 A, respectively) are indicated by the short lines on the right-hand axis. For the first unit cells (up to \approx 100 A), the in-plane lattice parameter is very close to that of the substrate. For larger thicknesses -- as the creation of misfit dislocations sets in -- a decrease of the lattice parameters is observed, but even at the maximum thickness studied here, there is no saturation. In addition, the thin-film values are still larger than the bulk lattice parameters, suggesting that the strain is not yet completely relieved. This remaining difference -- averaged over the two data sets -- corresponds to an in-plane lattice expansion of about 0.4%. Owing to the faster thermal contraction of the substrate as the sample cools after deposition, this mismatch might be reduced at room temperature. The misfit dislocations have been observed,[13] and their strain fields distort the film at the film/substrate interface over a typical distance of 2-6 unit cells, occasionally even up to 12 unit cells. Nevertheless careful measurement of the misfit-dislocation spacings[28] of Sr-doped 214 films has recently confirmed that strain remains present in the film.

Within the resolution (\approx\!0.01 A) of the available instruments (x-ray diffraction, RHEED, and TEM), all thin films discussed here have a tetragonal structure. Even thin films of the undoped 214 compound -- which has the largest orthorhombic distortion (b\!-\!a\!\approx\!0.05 A) in bulk samples -- show no deviation from the tetragonal symmetry. It is known that

Figure 3: Evolution of the in-plane d_{[100]} (\bullet) and d_{[100]} (\blacksquare) lattice parameters as a function of thickness for an undoped 214 film.

Figure 2: Evolution of the c-axis lattice parameter versus Sr concentration for thick (\blacksquare) and thin (\bullet) films as well as for bulk samples (\blacktriangle).

  the undoped orthorhombic 214 lattice can be transformed into a tetragonal lattice by the application of _hydrostatic_ pressure of about 4 GPa.[29]

The above experimental data (the room-temperature _c_-axis lattice parameters, the high-temperature _in-plane_ lattice parameters, and the absence of an orthorhombic distortion) unambiguously suggest that the thin films on SrTiO 3 are under tension. Unfortunately, these data were gathered under widely different experimental conditions, and with insufficient precision to allow a fully quantitative stress analysis. Qualitatively, however, the _cause_ of this stress is an increased _in-plane_ lattice parameter with a reduced _c_-axis lattice parameter as a _consequence_. Experimentally, an identical situation cannot be realized using high-pressure methods. In a uniaxial pressure experiment, cause and consequence are interchanged compared to our case, but similar changes in lattice parameters should be observed. Since no literature data are available regarding the evolution of the lattice parameters under uniaxial pressure, estimates from hydrostatic or quasihydrostatic experiments are used. The above lattice parameters show that the films are under tension, in a state that is qualitatively equivalent to the application of a _pseudouniaxial_ pressure of the order of 2-3 GPa along the c axis.

As described by Goodenough and Manthiam[30] for the 214 compounds the La 2O 2 sheets are under tension in the K2NiF4 structure, because the eight La-O distances measured (three La-O distances 2.52 A, five La-O distances 2.714 A) are close to or larger than the sum of the ionic radii: 2.55 A. However, the cohesion of the structure is ensured by the very short apical La-O bond ( 2.35 A). If the a and b lattice parameters increase -- as is the case in our films -- the lateral La-O distances should also increase, which therefore induces even more lateral tension in the La 2O 2 sheets. In order to compensate such a stress, the apical La-O distances must decrease, corresponding to a decrease of the c axis in our thin films.

In the following paragraph we compare the normal-state properties of the films with those of bulk compounds under pressure. Unfortunately only few uniaxial-pressure measurements on the 214 compound exist. Therefore we make the reasonable assumption that the observed in-plane film properties are affected by the in-plane epitaxial tensile strain (i.e., a negative pressure) to a similar _magnitude_ as is found under hydrostatic (positive) pressure for bulk compounds, but with _opposite sign_.

For the 214 system, it has been shown by Tanahashi _et al.[31]_ that hydrostatic pressure has only a small effect (a few %/GPa) on the Hall coefficient over the entire doping range (0.08-0.24), which is in contrast to the sizable dependences found in the other hole-doped superconductors.[24] We are unaware of any uniaxial pressure Hall effect measurements, but a change of \simeq 10% in Hall coefficient is reasonable. For instance, those films that have a maximum critical temperature for a given thickness, show a Hall coefficient within 10% of the corresponding bulk value, suggesting that this effect is indeed small. Since we calibrated the actual Sr content in the films using the Hall coefficient of bulk samples, an uncertainty in the Sr content of our films is also expected. The changes in the resistivity under hydrostatic conditions are larger (\leq10%/GPa) (Ref. [24]) for this compound, and again, to our knowledge, no uniaxial measurements are available. However, since the in-plane lattice parameters increase, the in-plane resistivity (\rho_{ab}) must increase accordingly, while the out-of plane resistivity (\rho_{c}) and the anisotropy (\rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}) must decrease. Further proof of this mechanism comes from the growth of 214 thin films on SrTiO 4 substrates, where the lattice mismatch is much smaller and in the opposite direction. In this case, the in-plane and _c_-axis lattice parameters are very close to the bulk values.[25] The resistivity of these thin films is indeed smaller (\simeq20-30%), in excellent agreement with those of thick films and single crystals and a high critical temperatures can be reached (38 K).

## IV Critical Temperature

The critical temperature (T_{c}) versus x was measured both resistively and inductively, and is shown in Fig. 4 for both thin (39, 50, and 65 nm) and thick (200 nm) films prepared under identical conditions. Typical transitions widths -- in both types of measurements -- are 2-3 K, independent of the amount of doping. There is no evidence for a composition-dependent zero-field broadening of the transition. The maximum critical temperature observed, at optimum doping (_x_ = 0.16) for the thickest films, is about 28 K; away from optimal doping, the critical temperature decreases. These data also confirm the well-known but not yet understood trend that the critical temperature of thin 214 films grown on SrTiO 3 strongly depends on the film thickness,[14, 17] a T_{c} above 30 K being observed only for very large thicknesses.

Different structural phases with a different T_{c} occur in the 214 system as the structural details, such as the octahedral tilting angle and the orthorhombicity, are changed.[33] In thin films on a lattice-mismatched substrate, these parameters are

Figure 4: The critical temperature as a function of Sr concentration for thin (‚ñ†) and thick (‚óè) films.

  expected to differ from bulk values. The structural study presented here showed the presence of a significant tensile strain, which might explain -- at least partially -- the reduced critical temperature of these films. To our knowledge only one direct experiment of the uniaxial pressure dependence of the critical temperature is available in the literature: Motoi _et al._[34] studied this property on grain-aligned 214 composites as a function of Sr doping and found that T_{c} decreases, at the rate of 3 to 9 K/GPa, under pressure applied along the c axis, depending on the doping level.

Alternatively the uniaxial pressure derivatives of T_{c} can be obtained by measuring the thermal-expansion anomalies at T_{c} along the different crystallographic orientations using the Ehrenfest relation. This method, which requires the knowledge of the specific-heat jump at the transition temperature, has been used by several authors, [24, 35, 36, 37] and estimates of approximately -\,6 to -\,7 K/GPa for dT_{c}/dP_{c} (for pressure applied along the c axis), 2 K/GPa for dT_{c}/dP_{a}, and 5 K/GPa dT_{c}/dP_{b} have been reported for optimally doped samples. These data on bulk 214 samples, together with in-plane tensile strains equivalent to an estimated pseudouniaxial pressure of the order of 2 GPa, can easily explain the drastic reduction of the critical temperature in thin films to values around 20 K. A more quantitative analysis would require measurements of the pressure dependence of the critical temperature of both a- and c-axis 214 thin films as was done by Bud'ko _et al._[38] for 123.

For thicker films more strain is relieved (although this is not clearly visible from the data in Fig. 2). The critical temperature is indeed higher, but the general trend of T_{c} versus x is the same for both thicknesses (see Fig. 4). Indeed, it is well known that applying pressure to this high-T_{c} cuprate changes the _absolute values_ of the critical temperature but does not affect the _general trend_ of the superconducting properties (for instance, the maximum of T_{c}(x) still occurs for x \approx 0.16). Applying a high-pressure oxygen treatment to such thin films can restore the bulk critical temperatures. [39] We did not perform such a treatment, as it introduces yet another process variable and as it can change the carrier density if additional oxygen is incorporated.

## V Complex impedance measurements

To determine \lambda, several methods have been used, such as muon spin resonance (\muSR) measurements, [3] 'mixed-state" magnetization isotherms [8, 40] [i.e., M(H) in the reversible regime], and microwave experiments. [41] Here we derive \lambda_{ab} from a two-coil mutual inductance measurement. [42] This technique allows the complex sheet impedance Z_{\square} = R_{\square} + _i_\omega_L_{\square} to be extracted from the measured real and imaginary parts of the signal using a numerical inversion procedure. In zero field, L_{\square} is the sheet kinetic inductance L_{K}, which is related to the penetration depth \lambda_{ab} by L_{K} = \mu_{0}\lambda_{ab}^{2}/d, with \mu_{0} the vacuum permittivity and d the film thickness. On the other hand, R_{\square} = \rho_{ab}/d is related to dissipation resulting from vortex motion.

### Activation energy

Close to T_{c} and in a magnetic field parallel to the c axis, we find that ln\rho_{ab}, as inferred from resistive and inductive measurements, varies linearly with 1/T, implying thermally activated vortex motion over a pinning barrier. The activation energies \Delta\,U(T = 0) derived from the inductively measured \rho_{ab}(T) curves at H = 0.4 T are presented in Fig. 5 as a function of x for different film thicknesses. These data are very different from those reported in the literature, [14] where a large field broadening was observed in the underdoped regime, but not in the overdoped regime. We want to point out that the field used here (0.4 T) is much smaller and that the activation energy is obtained from \rho_{ab} values that are very close to the onset of resistance, in the resistivity range between 10^{-3} and 10^{-6}\,\mu\Omega cm, i.e., five to eight decades below \rho_{50\text{ K}} (see figures in Ref. 12). Hence these data cannot easily be related to those extracted from the broadening of the resistive transition in the 100 \mu\Omega cm range and the doping dependence reported. [14]

In Fig. 5\Delta\,U reaches a maximum the height of which depends on the film thickness for optimum doping and decreases as one deviates from it. It is generally expected that \Delta\,U is proportional to 1/\lambda^{2}. For instance, Feigel'man _et al._[43] propose that the activation energy of a dislocation pair in the 2D collective-pinning model behaves as \Delta\,U = (\Phi_{0}^{2}d/1\,\theta\,\pi^{2}\,\mu_{0}\lambda_{0}^{2})ln(a_{0}/\xi_{0}), [44] where a_{0} is the flux-line lattice spacing. Since a_{0}/\xi_{0}\gg 1 at the field of interest in our studies, the logarithmic term is a slowly varying function of x, so that \Delta\,U(x) is essentially proportional to \lambda^{-2}(x). Another relation was proposed by Blatter _et al._[45] for the case of a single vortex along the c axis of a 3D superconductor containing randomly distributed, weak pinning centers: \Delta\,U = \Phi_{0}^{2}\xi_{0}\,\delta^{1/3}e^{2/3}/\pi^{2}\,\mu_{0}\lambda_{0}^{2}, where \delta is a disorder parameter and e^{2} the mass anisotropy. Although \varepsilon is strongly doping dependent in the underdoped case, it becomes almost constant in the overdoped regime, [8] and therefore \Delta\,U(x) \propto\lambda^{-2}(x). Thus the conclusion emerging from the data in

Figure 5: The activation energy for flux flow \Delta\,U/k_{B} (expressed in temperature units) as a function of the Sr concentration for thin (\blacksquare) and thick (\blacksquare) films.

  Fig. 5 is that l(_x_) is _nonmonotonic_ in x with a minimum value at optimum doping. Stronger pinning, as suggested in Ref. 8, and/or a larger disorder d cannot explain the data in the overdoped regime.

### Penetration depth

Additional and even stronger evidence of the nonmonotonic l-2(_x_) with Sr doping is provided by direct measurements of l_ab_ using the mutual-inductance technique. The temperature dependence of l_ab_(_T_) has already been published.12 Except for the temperature regime close to T_{c} (where critical fluctuations play an important role), the temperature dependence can be fitted reasonably well with a two-fluid relation l/l0(_T_)=[1-(_t_)4]-1/2, (_t_ = _T_/_T__c_), allowing the extrapolation of l to T - 0 K. Figure 6 shows the extrapolated l(0) (open symbols) as a function of doping. Fitting the same data with a BCS-type relation reduces the absolute values of l(0) by \sqrt{2}, but does not change the doping dependence. Note that in the present context the detailed temperature dependence is unimportant, as the experimental data at a specific value of t are already sufficient to illustrate our point.12 For instance, an alternative derivation of l is provided by an analysis of the data close to T_{c}. In this region 3D fluctuations lead to a l(_T_)/l0 = [1-_t_]-1/3 dependence,5,12 and values of l0 have been included in Fig. 6 (filled symbols). It is expected that l0 <= l(0), as observed experimentally, but regardless of the values used, a _nonmonotonic_ behavior of l(_x_) with a minimum close to optimum doping is obtained. The values for thick films confirm this observation and have also been included (()).

We do not place too much emphasis on the absolute values of the penetration depths obtained, as several experimental details render a comparison with bulk samples [where l_ab_(0) = 3000 A at optimum doping40] difficult. First, a simple relation between T_{c} and l0 has been observed experimentally, namely _the Uemura plot_3 that partially explains the large values of the penetration depth observed here: the values of l0 <= 6000 A are simply due to the lower T_{c} between 20 and 30 K.3,4,8 Indeed, this experimental correlation yields a relation between T_{c} and l0 of optimally doped cuprate superconductors: {T_{c}}{\propto}{\lambda_{0}}^{-2}. Hence, rather than a bulk l0 value of <=3000 A, our films would ideally have a l0 value of <=4200 A, close to what we actually observe.

Secondly, to deduce l0 from the measured L_{K}, we have used the nominal film thickness. Actually, on account of the presence of strain fields which suppress superconductivity in those portions of the film which are close to the substrate, the effective thickness where superconductivity is established homogeneously might be less than the nominal one, thereby leading to smaller values of l0.

Thirdly, the equation42 used to derive the value of L_{K} from the inductive measurements is valid for shielding currents extending over very large radii. The lateral dimensions of our thin films (1 cm2, i.e., only 2-3 times larger than the driving-coil diameter) will certainly affect the shielding efficiency, which might lead to higher values of the penetration depth.

Finally, we have shown that the films are subject to an in-plane _epitaxial tensile strain_ that reduces T_{c}. It is not known to what extent this strain influences the absolute values of the penetration depth or its anisotropy (l_ab_/l_c_). In any case, the first argument is certainly valid, and the remaining difference between the bulk and our thin-film values (4200-6000 A) is probably due a combination of the three other experimental constraints. As the remaining difference is rather small, _the observed behavior is intrinsic and cannot be an artefact due to the sample quality_.

These different experimental constraints are not expected to be a strong function of doping, thus we focus on _the general trend of the data_ as a function of Sr content rather than on the absolute values. For instance, when comparing our film data in the underdoped regime to those available for bulk samples,3,4,8 the same experimental trend can be observed [in both cases l(0)(_x_ = 0.1)/l(0)(_x_ = 0.16) = 2]. In the overdoped regime, values of l are difficult to obtain for bulk samples.8 The thin-film data presented here are the first for heavily overdoped 214 samples, and _the excellent agreement between the films and bulk samples in the underdoped regime suggests that the observed nonmonotonic behavior in the overdoped regime is an intrinsic property of this compound_.

## VI Discussion

The results obtained from resistive and inductive measurements indicate that, despite the fact that more carriers are being added to the system, the screening capability of the superconductor is reduced in the overdoped regime. _This is the main result of our paper and is in marked contrast to the simple London prediction l_ab_-2_x__n__j_/m*. This effect has also been observed in overdoped Tl and 123 compounds.12,6

### Dirty limit

Such a behavior could be expected for a superconductor in the dirty limit (l(l\ll\xi_{0}), and estimates indicate that l must be smaller than \xi_{0}/10 in order to explain the observed upturn. The mean free path in the 214 system has been estimated from resistivity [46] and infrared [47] measurements. From the resistivity measurements a value of \rho\timesl = 3 \times 10^{-10}\Omega cm^{2} has been derived for an optimally doped sample. For the regime of interest (optimally to overdoped), our \rho values -- close to T_{c} -- are between 100 and 200 \mu\Omega cm, which gives a mean free path of 300 to 150 A, respectively. The infrared measurement of a thick, optimally doped 214 film (8200 A) close to T_{c} , led to an estimate of l\approx 275 A a value that is in agreement with the resistivity measurement. From these estimates, it is clear that l is much too large compared to the quoted short coherence length in these cuprates, to explain the observed upturn in \lambda .

### 3D _xy_

The results are consistent with the analysis of thermal fluctuations close to T_{c} (3D _xy_ critical behavior), which leads to a relation between the specific-heat singularity, \lambda and T_{c} .[5] With this relation, \lambda can be derived from the specific-heat singularity and T_{c} , T_{c}\propto\lambda_{0}^{-2}, and an increase of \lambda in the overdoped regime is predicted, _independent of any microscopic mechanism of superconductivity_. Hence, the 3D _xy_ behavior extends over the entire phase-transition line T_{c}(x). Recently this consistency, together with a finite-size effect observed in the temperature dependence of \lambda close to T_{c} , was used to derive the amplitude of the perpendicular real-space phase correlation length \xi_{x0}^{\phi} as a function of doping for the same series of samples .[48]

### n_{s}/m*

On a microscopic basis, \lambda is related to other parameters of the superconducting state, such as the superfluid density n_{s} (not to be confused with the carrier density) and the effective mass of the carriers m*: \lambda^{-2}\propton_{s}/m*. This raises the question whether the superfluid density n_{s} or the effective mass m* is responsible for the increase of \lambda as doping proceeds beyond the optimum value. Various possibilities have already been suggested .[1, 40] To go beyond these arguments, the question to be addressed is whether these additional carriers introduced in the system beyond optimum doping all contribute to the superfluid, i.e., whether n_{s}\rightarrown at zero temperature and/or whether microscopic phenomena (on length scales smaller than \lambda), such as a _chemical_ or an _electronic phase separation_,[49] could actually lower n_{s}. An analysis of the optical conductivity ,[50] the ^{63}Cu relaxation rate, the ^{63}Cu Knight shift ,[51] and of the specific heat [52] suggests that the added carriers in the overdoped regime only partially condense into pairs.

## VII Conclusions

We have shown that the epitaxial driving force imposes a residual tension on the 214 thin films grown on SrTiO_{3}. This tension has significant effects on both the normal state and the superconducting properties of these films, mainly by increasing the resistivity and decreasing the critical temperature. Measurements of the penetration depth as a function of doping reveal a nonmonotonic dependence, previously not observed in this compound. After completion of this work, we have been informed that \muSR measurements of the doping dependence of \lambda in bulk 214 compounds [53] are fully consistent with our observations.

###### Abstract

Normal-state properties, such as the resistivity \rho_{ab} and the Hall coefficient R_{H}, structural properties, such as the c axis and in-plane lattice parameters, and superconductive properties, such as the critical temperature T_{c}, the penetration depth \lambda_{ab}, and the thermal activation energy for flux flow \Delta\,U, are reported for c-axis La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4\pm\delta} films. These parameters have been measured as a function of doping in the range from heavily underdoped to heavily overdoped. The structural data indicate a 0.3% compression of the c-axis parameter and a corresponding 0.3% expansion of the in-plane lattice parameters as compared to bulk values, which explains the overall reduced critical temperature of these thin films. As the dopant content is increased, maximum values for T_{c}, \Delta U, and \lambda_{ab}^{-1} are observed close to optimum doping, while R_{H} and \rho_{ab} decrease monotonically.

## 1 Introduction

It is of fundamental importance to establish the doping (_x_) dependence of the superconducting properties in cuprate superconductors. Of particular relevance are the phase-transition line T_{c}(x), which distinguishes the normal from the superconducting state, and the penetration depth \lambda(x). Indeed a maximum T_{c} is observed for "optimum" doping, with a decrease in both the underdoped and overdoped regimes. The penetration depth \lambda characterizes the appearance of the Meissner state, and its "true" doping dependence is currently a topic of considerable debate.[1, 2, 3, 4] On the other hand, from a phase-transition point of view, an analysis of thermal fluctuations points to three-dimensional (3D) _xy_ critical behavior, which leads to a relation between the specific-heat singularity, \lambda and T_{c}, and predicts an increase of \lambda in the overdoped regime, _independent of any microscopic mechanism of superconductivity_.[5] Recent work on overdoped Tl compounds[1, 2] and overdoped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} "123" compounds[6] appears to confirm these predictions.

In this paper we report careful measurements of various properties on c-axis La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} ('214") thin films, covering the doping regime from heavily underdoped to heavily overdoped. Particular attention was given to the preparation of _high-quality, homogeneous films_. First, the normal-state properties, such as the Hall coefficient R_{H} and the in-plane resistivity \rho_{ab}, are obtained as a function of doping; they allow an estimate of the mean free path l. Second, the evolution of the structural properties is reported as a function of doping and thickness. Then the thermal activation energy for flux flow, \Delta\,U -- related to \lambda -- is derived from \rho_{ab}(T) measurements in a magnetic field close to T_{c}. Finally, the in-plane penetration depth \lambda_{ab} is obtained directly from the kinetic inductance L_{K} for the same samples. About 20 samples have been characterized, and this work represents the most complete study of the behavior of \lambda from the heavily underdoped to the heavily overdoped regime to date.

The original Sr-doped La_{2}CuO_{4} compound[7] is an attrac  tive material for such a study, as it supports "bulk" and homogeneous superconductivity over a large range of doping as recently demonstrated.[8, 9] The preparation of "bulk" homogeneous "214" samples is tedious (particularly in the overdoped regime), owing to the very slow Sr incorporation into the easily formed undoped 214 lattice during solid-state sintering at the standard temperatures (more than 100 h are necessary for sintering at 900 degC).[9] This effect and the resulting "chemical phase separation" could well explain Uemura's early results[3] as well as the claims that superconductivity is restricted to a narrow composition range.[10, 11] From a sample-preparation point of view, the thin-film growth process is ideal for avoiding the occurrence of chemical phase separation. The growth process is mostly 2D, as films with large and atomically flat surfaces (\mum size) can easily be obtained.[12] This indicates that the surface diffusion coefficients are certainly large enough to ensure a homogeneous Sr distribution. The films used here were grown on SrTiO3 using sequential molecular-beam deposition; the deposition details and the overall structural properties of the films have been published elsewhere.[12, 13] Briefly, x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed single-phase and _c_-axis single-crystal films with a surface roughness of about one unit cell (over 1 \mum^{2}) and a microstructure that is essentially free of the usual defects observed in high-T_{c} cuprate films, such as secondary phase inclusions, _a_-axis inclusions, grain and/or twin boundaries. Strong chemical inhomogeneity, such as that induced by large-scale Sr clustering, can be observed using TEM.[13] However during the TEM investigations of the films, no evidence of such behavior was found in the entire doping range studied.

## II Normal-state properties

The normal-state properties \rho^{-1} and R_{H}^{-1} obtained at 100 K using standard four-point and Hall-effect measurements are summarized in Fig. 1 as a function of doping. For both quantities a _monotonic increase_ is observed with increasing Sr content. They are in _excellent agreement_ with literature data of other thin films on SrTiO3 having a comparable thickness, although single crystals and thicker films show reduced resistivities (\approx20-30 %).[14, 15, 16, 17] Higher resistivity values are typically taken as evidence of poor sample quality. On the other hand, the resistance ratio (\rho_{300} k/\rho_{50} k) is also a good indicator for the quality of the thin films, and values between 3.3 and 3.5 were obtained for the optimally doped films. These values are as good as or better than those cited for the best films or single crystals reported so far, indicating a similar sample quality.[17] This apparent contradiction originates from a residual in-plane tensile stress, which expands the in-plane lattice constants and increases the resistivity to \approx20-30 %. A quantitative argumentation is given below. We used the published R_{H}^{-1} values as a calibration curve to correct the experimental uncertainty (\approx10%) in the Sr content of our films.

Models must be used to relate \rho^{-1} and R_{H}^{-1} to the carrier density n, and only the simplest ones predict a direct proportionality, \rho^{-1}\propton and R_{H}^{-1}\propton. Although more elaborate models could modify these predictions, we expect that \rho^{-1} and R_{H}^{-1} increase with n. Therefore our data suggest that the carrier density increases with Sr doping. Further evidence of this comes from normal-state measurements of the Cu spin-lattice-relaxation rate, the magnetic shift and the spin susceptibility obtained from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on this compound[18] as well as on overdoped YBa2Cu3O7 (Ref. [19]) and Tl2Ba2CuO6.[20, 21] These _independent_ measurements clearly suggest that an increase in the Sr content indeed increases n.

## III Structural properties

While the normal-state properties are in excellent agreement with literature values, there is a significant difference between the lattice parameters of 214 thin films on SrTiO3 and those of the bulk 214. From \theta-2 \theta x-ray-diffraction experiments, the value of the _c_-axis lattice parameter can be derived and is shown in Fig. 2 as a function of Sr content for our thin and thick films as well as for bulk samples.[22] These data are in very good agreement with those recently reported for laser-ablated 214 thin films on SrTiO3.[23] Although there is an experimental error (\pm 0.01 A) in the determination of the _c_-axis lattice parameter for the thin films, a comparison between the data of films and bulk material indicates an average difference of \simeq 0.045 A, i.e., a contraction of about 0.35%. To compress the bulk 214 lattice to such an extent along the c axis, a pressure of 1.6-2.2 GPa (depending on Sr doping) would be necessary under _hydrostatic_ conditions.[24]

There are two possible origins for this difference in lattice parameters. First, it is well documented that an oxygen deficiency in the 214 lattice gives rise to a reduced _c_-axis lattice parameter. This possibility can be excluded, as the samples are cooled under a flow of atomic oxygen that is sufficiently powerful to fill even some interstitial oxygen sites and that can induce superconductivity at 32 K in 214 thin films prepared without Sr, (La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta}).[32] In addition, a post-annealing of these films in an oxygen atmosphere at

Figure 1: Inverse resistivity (‚óè) and inverse Hall coefficient (‚ñ†) at 100 K versus Sr concentration.

  700 degC for 24 h does not significantly change the lattice parameters. The second possibility is related to the in-plane lattice parameter difference between SrTiO3 (3.9 A) and 214 (3.8 A). The 2.5% larger in-plane lattice parameter of the substrate could be partially responsible for the film in-plane lattice parameter extension, which would induce a shorter c-axis lattice parameter. During thin film growth such a large discrepancy between lattice parameters is usually accommodated by the appearance of misfit dislocations (for thicknesses larger than the critical thickness). For our 214 thin films, we have shown[13] that a regular network of misfit dislocations exists that accommodates "most" of the lattice misfit.

To find out whether the lattice misfit is completely accommodated by the creation of misfit dislocations, we have performed a detailed analysis of _in-situ_ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) spectra recorded during the deposition of an undoped 214 film on SrTiO3 at 750 degC. The RHEED images of the film present a series of long streaks at regular spacings, characteristic of two-dimensional growth.[12] Line scans taken across such spectra show a series of peaks that have been fitted using the Phexagon VII peak profile. From the peak positions the in-plane lattice parameter can be estimated _in principle_ with an accuracy of \approx 0.01 A. However to obtain an accurate absolute value the precise geometrical diffraction conditions must be known. Minute geometrical changes of the sample manipulator during a temperature ramp currently prevent a measurement of the lattice parameters as a function of the temperature. Hence such a precision can only be maintained for a comparison under identical conditions (such as during growth). A more detailed report of this method and the analysis of the _in-situ_ RHEED data is in preparation.[25]

To calibrate the vertical axis of Fig. 3 precisely we have used the lattice parameter of the substrate but extrapolated to 750 degC by using literature values of the thermal-expansion coefficients (\alpha) of SrTiO3 and 214. For SrTiO3, \alpha\!=\!11\!\times\!10^{-6}/K,[26] which gives a d_{[100]} spacing of 3.937 A. The only data we found regarding the thermal expansion of undoped 214 at temperatures much above the orthorhombic-tetragonal phase-transition temperature are given in Ref. [27], namely, \alpha\!=\!8.5\!\times\!10^{-6}/K and a d_{[100]} spacing of 3.826 A.

The evolution of the [100] and [110] lattice parameters is shown in Fig. 3 as a function of the number of unit cells deposited. The extrapolated bulk 214 values (3.826 and 2.703 A, respectively) are indicated by the short lines on the right-hand axis. For the first unit cells (up to \approx 100 A), the in-plane lattice parameter is very close to that of the substrate. For larger thicknesses -- as the creation of misfit dislocations sets in -- a decrease of the lattice parameters is observed, but even at the maximum thickness studied here, there is no saturation. In addition, the thin-film values are still larger than the bulk lattice parameters, suggesting that the strain is not yet completely relieved. This remaining difference -- averaged over the two data sets -- corresponds to an in-plane lattice expansion of about 0.4%. Owing to the faster thermal contraction of the substrate as the sample cools after deposition, this mismatch might be reduced at room temperature. The misfit dislocations have been observed,[13] and their strain fields distort the film at the film/substrate interface over a typical distance of 2-6 unit cells, occasionally even up to 12 unit cells. Nevertheless careful measurement of the misfit-dislocation spacings[28] of Sr-doped 214 films has recently confirmed that strain remains present in the film.

Within the resolution (\approx\!0.01 A) of the available instruments (x-ray diffraction, RHEED, and TEM), all thin films discussed here have a tetragonal structure. Even thin films of the undoped 214 compound -- which has the largest orthorhombic distortion (b\!-\!a\!\approx\!0.05 A) in bulk samples -- show no deviation from the tetragonal symmetry. It is known that

Figure 3: Evolution of the in-plane d_{[100]} (\bullet) and d_{[100]} (\blacksquare) lattice parameters as a function of thickness for an undoped 214 film.

Figure 2: Evolution of the c-axis lattice parameter versus Sr concentration for thick (\blacksquare) and thin (\bullet) films as well as for bulk samples (\blacktriangle).

  the undoped orthorhombic 214 lattice can be transformed into a tetragonal lattice by the application of _hydrostatic_ pressure of about 4 GPa.[29]

The above experimental data (the room-temperature _c_-axis lattice parameters, the high-temperature _in-plane_ lattice parameters, and the absence of an orthorhombic distortion) unambiguously suggest that the thin films on SrTiO 3 are under tension. Unfortunately, these data were gathered under widely different experimental conditions, and with insufficient precision to allow a fully quantitative stress analysis. Qualitatively, however, the _cause_ of this stress is an increased _in-plane_ lattice parameter with a reduced _c_-axis lattice parameter as a _consequence_. Experimentally, an identical situation cannot be realized using high-pressure methods. In a uniaxial pressure experiment, cause and consequence are interchanged compared to our case, but similar changes in lattice parameters should be observed. Since no literature data are available regarding the evolution of the lattice parameters under uniaxial pressure, estimates from hydrostatic or quasihydrostatic experiments are used. The above lattice parameters show that the films are under tension, in a state that is qualitatively equivalent to the application of a _pseudouniaxial_ pressure of the order of 2-3 GPa along the c axis.

As described by Goodenough and Manthiam[30] for the 214 compounds the La 2O 2 sheets are under tension in the K2NiF4 structure, because the eight La-O distances measured (three La-O distances 2.52 A, five La-O distances 2.714 A) are close to or larger than the sum of the ionic radii: 2.55 A. However, the cohesion of the structure is ensured by the very short apical La-O bond ( 2.35 A). If the a and b lattice parameters increase -- as is the case in our films -- the lateral La-O distances should also increase, which therefore induces even more lateral tension in the La 2O 2 sheets. In order to compensate such a stress, the apical La-O distances must decrease, corresponding to a decrease of the c axis in our thin films.

In the following paragraph we compare the normal-state properties of the films with those of bulk compounds under pressure. Unfortunately only few uniaxial-pressure measurements on the 214 compound exist. Therefore we make the reasonable assumption that the observed in-plane film properties are affected by the in-plane epitaxial tensile strain (i.e., a negative pressure) to a similar _magnitude_ as is found under hydrostatic (positive) pressure for bulk compounds, but with _opposite sign_.

For the 214 system, it has been shown by Tanahashi _et al.[31]_ that hydrostatic pressure has only a small effect (a few %/GPa) on the Hall coefficient over the entire doping range (0.08-0.24), which is in contrast to the sizable dependences found in the other hole-doped superconductors.[24] We are unaware of any uniaxial pressure Hall effect measurements, but a change of \simeq 10% in Hall coefficient is reasonable. For instance, those films that have a maximum critical temperature for a given thickness, show a Hall coefficient within 10% of the corresponding bulk value, suggesting that this effect is indeed small. Since we calibrated the actual Sr content in the films using the Hall coefficient of bulk samples, an uncertainty in the Sr content of our films is also expected. The changes in the resistivity under hydrostatic conditions are larger (\leq10%/GPa) (Ref. [24]) for this compound, and again, to our knowledge, no uniaxial measurements are available. However, since the in-plane lattice parameters increase, the in-plane resistivity (\rho_{ab}) must increase accordingly, while the out-of plane resistivity (\rho_{c}) and the anisotropy (\rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}) must decrease. Further proof of this mechanism comes from the growth of 214 thin films on SrTiO 4 substrates, where the lattice mismatch is much smaller and in the opposite direction. In this case, the in-plane and _c_-axis lattice parameters are very close to the bulk values.[25] The resistivity of these thin films is indeed smaller (\simeq20-30%), in excellent agreement with those of thick films and single crystals and a high critical temperatures can be reached (38 K).

## IV Critical Temperature

The critical temperature (T_{c}) versus x was measured both resistively and inductively, and is shown in Fig. 4 for both thin (39, 50, and 65 nm) and thick (200 nm) films prepared under identical conditions. Typical transitions widths -- in both types of measurements -- are 2-3 K, independent of the amount of doping. There is no evidence for a composition-dependent zero-field broadening of the transition. The maximum critical temperature observed, at optimum doping (_x_ = 0.16) for the thickest films, is about 28 K; away from optimal doping, the critical temperature decreases. These data also confirm the well-known but not yet understood trend that the critical temperature of thin 214 films grown on SrTiO 3 strongly depends on the film thickness,[14, 17] a T_{c} above 30 K being observed only for very large thicknesses.

Different structural phases with a different T_{c} occur in the 214 system as the structural details, such as the octahedral tilting angle and the orthorhombicity, are changed.[33] In thin films on a lattice-mismatched substrate, these parameters are

Figure 4: The critical temperature as a function of Sr concentration for thin (‚ñ†) and thick (‚óè) films.

  expected to differ from bulk values. The structural study presented here showed the presence of a significant tensile strain, which might explain -- at least partially -- the reduced critical temperature of these films. To our knowledge only one direct experiment of the uniaxial pressure dependence of the critical temperature is available in the literature: Motoi _et al._[34] studied this property on grain-aligned 214 composites as a function of Sr doping and found that T_{c} decreases, at the rate of 3 to 9 K/GPa, under pressure applied along the c axis, depending on the doping level.

Alternatively the uniaxial pressure derivatives of T_{c} can be obtained by measuring the thermal-expansion anomalies at T_{c} along the different crystallographic orientations using the Ehrenfest relation. This method, which requires the knowledge of the specific-heat jump at the transition temperature, has been used by several authors, [24, 35, 36, 37] and estimates of approximately -\,6 to -\,7 K/GPa for dT_{c}/dP_{c} (for pressure applied along the c axis), 2 K/GPa for dT_{c}/dP_{a}, and 5 K/GPa dT_{c}/dP_{b} have been reported for optimally doped samples. These data on bulk 214 samples, together with in-plane tensile strains equivalent to an estimated pseudouniaxial pressure of the order of 2 GPa, can easily explain the drastic reduction of the critical temperature in thin films to values around 20 K. A more quantitative analysis would require measurements of the pressure dependence of the critical temperature of both a- and c-axis 214 thin films as was done by Bud'ko _et al._[38] for 123.

For thicker films more strain is relieved (although this is not clearly visible from the data in Fig. 2). The critical temperature is indeed higher, but the general trend of T_{c} versus x is the same for both thicknesses (see Fig. 4). Indeed, it is well known that applying pressure to this high-T_{c} cuprate changes the _absolute values_ of the critical temperature but does not affect the _general trend_ of the superconducting properties (for instance, the maximum of T_{c}(x) still occurs for x \approx 0.16). Applying a high-pressure oxygen treatment to such thin films can restore the bulk critical temperatures. [39] We did not perform such a treatment, as it introduces yet another process variable and as it can change the carrier density if additional oxygen is incorporated.

## V Complex impedance measurements

To determine \lambda, several methods have been used, such as muon spin resonance (\muSR) measurements, [3] 'mixed-state" magnetization isotherms [8, 40] [i.e., M(H) in the reversible regime], and microwave experiments. [41] Here we derive \lambda_{ab} from a two-coil mutual inductance measurement. [42] This technique allows the complex sheet impedance Z_{\square} = R_{\square} + _i_\omega_L_{\square} to be extracted from the measured real and imaginary parts of the signal using a numerical inversion procedure. In zero field, L_{\square} is the sheet kinetic inductance L_{K}, which is related to the penetration depth \lambda_{ab} by L_{K} = \mu_{0}\lambda_{ab}^{2}/d, with \mu_{0} the vacuum permittivity and d the film thickness. On the other hand, R_{\square} = \rho_{ab}/d is related to dissipation resulting from vortex motion.

### Activation energy

Close to T_{c} and in a magnetic field parallel to the c axis, we find that ln\rho_{ab}, as inferred from resistive and inductive measurements, varies linearly with 1/T, implying thermally activated vortex motion over a pinning barrier. The activation energies \Delta\,U(T = 0) derived from the inductively measured \rho_{ab}(T) curves at H = 0.4 T are presented in Fig. 5 as a function of x for different film thicknesses. These data are very different from those reported in the literature, [14] where a large field broadening was observed in the underdoped regime, but not in the overdoped regime. We want to point out that the field used here (0.4 T) is much smaller and that the activation energy is obtained from \rho_{ab} values that are very close to the onset of resistance, in the resistivity range between 10^{-3} and 10^{-6}\,\mu\Omega cm, i.e., five to eight decades below \rho_{50\text{ K}} (see figures in Ref. 12). Hence these data cannot easily be related to those extracted from the broadening of the resistive transition in the 100 \mu\Omega cm range and the doping dependence reported. [14]

In Fig. 5\Delta\,U reaches a maximum the height of which depends on the film thickness for optimum doping and decreases as one deviates from it. It is generally expected that \Delta\,U is proportional to 1/\lambda^{2}. For instance, Feigel'man _et al._[43] propose that the activation energy of a dislocation pair in the 2D collective-pinning model behaves as \Delta\,U = (\Phi_{0}^{2}d/1\,\theta\,\pi^{2}\,\mu_{0}\lambda_{0}^{2})ln(a_{0}/\xi_{0}), [44] where a_{0} is the flux-line lattice spacing. Since a_{0}/\xi_{0}\gg 1 at the field of interest in our studies, the logarithmic term is a slowly varying function of x, so that \Delta\,U(x) is essentially proportional to \lambda^{-2}(x). Another relation was proposed by Blatter _et al._[45] for the case of a single vortex along the c axis of a 3D superconductor containing randomly distributed, weak pinning centers: \Delta\,U = \Phi_{0}^{2}\xi_{0}\,\delta^{1/3}e^{2/3}/\pi^{2}\,\mu_{0}\lambda_{0}^{2}, where \delta is a disorder parameter and e^{2} the mass anisotropy. Although \varepsilon is strongly doping dependent in the underdoped case, it becomes almost constant in the overdoped regime, [8] and therefore \Delta\,U(x) \propto\lambda^{-2}(x). Thus the conclusion emerging from the data in

Figure 5: The activation energy for flux flow \Delta\,U/k_{B} (expressed in temperature units) as a function of the Sr concentration for thin (\blacksquare) and thick (\blacksquare) films.

  Fig. 5 is that l(_x_) is _nonmonotonic_ in x with a minimum value at optimum doping. Stronger pinning, as suggested in Ref. 8, and/or a larger disorder d cannot explain the data in the overdoped regime.

### Penetration depth

Additional and even stronger evidence of the nonmonotonic l-2(_x_) with Sr doping is provided by direct measurements of l_ab_ using the mutual-inductance technique. The temperature dependence of l_ab_(_T_) has already been published.12 Except for the temperature regime close to T_{c} (where critical fluctuations play an important role), the temperature dependence can be fitted reasonably well with a two-fluid relation l/l0(_T_)=[1-(_t_)4]-1/2, (_t_ = _T_/_T__c_), allowing the extrapolation of l to T - 0 K. Figure 6 shows the extrapolated l(0) (open symbols) as a function of doping. Fitting the same data with a BCS-type relation reduces the absolute values of l(0) by \sqrt{2}, but does not change the doping dependence. Note that in the present context the detailed temperature dependence is unimportant, as the experimental data at a specific value of t are already sufficient to illustrate our point.12 For instance, an alternative derivation of l is provided by an analysis of the data close to T_{c}. In this region 3D fluctuations lead to a l(_T_)/l0 = [1-_t_]-1/3 dependence,5,12 and values of l0 have been included in Fig. 6 (filled symbols). It is expected that l0 <= l(0), as observed experimentally, but regardless of the values used, a _nonmonotonic_ behavior of l(_x_) with a minimum close to optimum doping is obtained. The values for thick films confirm this observation and have also been included (()).

We do not place too much emphasis on the absolute values of the penetration depths obtained, as several experimental details render a comparison with bulk samples [where l_ab_(0) = 3000 A at optimum doping40] difficult. First, a simple relation between T_{c} and l0 has been observed experimentally, namely _the Uemura plot_3 that partially explains the large values of the penetration depth observed here: the values of l0 <= 6000 A are simply due to the lower T_{c} between 20 and 30 K.3,4,8 Indeed, this experimental correlation yields a relation between T_{c} and l0 of optimally doped cuprate superconductors: {T_{c}}{\propto}{\lambda_{0}}^{-2}. Hence, rather than a bulk l0 value of <=3000 A, our films would ideally have a l0 value of <=4200 A, close to what we actually observe.

Secondly, to deduce l0 from the measured L_{K}, we have used the nominal film thickness. Actually, on account of the presence of strain fields which suppress superconductivity in those portions of the film which are close to the substrate, the effective thickness where superconductivity is established homogeneously might be less than the nominal one, thereby leading to smaller values of l0.

Thirdly, the equation42 used to derive the value of L_{K} from the inductive measurements is valid for shielding currents extending over very large radii. The lateral dimensions of our thin films (1 cm2, i.e., only 2-3 times larger than the driving-coil diameter) will certainly affect the shielding efficiency, which might lead to higher values of the penetration depth.

Finally, we have shown that the films are subject to an in-plane _epitaxial tensile strain_ that reduces T_{c}. It is not known to what extent this strain influences the absolute values of the penetration depth or its anisotropy (l_ab_/l_c_). In any case, the first argument is certainly valid, and the remaining difference between the bulk and our thin-film values (4200-6000 A) is probably due a combination of the three other experimental constraints. As the remaining difference is rather small, _the observed behavior is intrinsic and cannot be an artefact due to the sample quality_.

These different experimental constraints are not expected to be a strong function of doping, thus we focus on _the general trend of the data_ as a function of Sr content rather than on the absolute values. For instance, when comparing our film data in the underdoped regime to those available for bulk samples,3,4,8 the same experimental trend can be observed [in both cases l(0)(_x_ = 0.1)/l(0)(_x_ = 0.16) = 2]. In the overdoped regime, values of l are difficult to obtain for bulk samples.8 The thin-film data presented here are the first for heavily overdoped 214 samples, and _the excellent agreement between the films and bulk samples in the underdoped regime suggests that the observed nonmonotonic behavior in the overdoped regime is an intrinsic property of this compound_.

## VI Discussion

The results obtained from resistive and inductive measurements indicate that, despite the fact that more carriers are being added to the system, the screening capability of the superconductor is reduced in the overdoped regime. _This is the main result of our paper and is in marked contrast to the simple London prediction l_ab_-2_x__n__j_/m*. This effect has also been observed in overdoped Tl and 123 compounds.12,6

### Dirty limit

Such a behavior could be expected for a superconductor in the dirty limit (l(l\ll\xi_{0}), and estimates indicate that l must be smaller than \xi_{0}/10 in order to explain the observed upturn. The mean free path in the 214 system has been estimated from resistivity [46] and infrared [47] measurements. From the resistivity measurements a value of \rho\timesl = 3 \times 10^{-10}\Omega cm^{2} has been derived for an optimally doped sample. For the regime of interest (optimally to overdoped), our \rho values -- close to T_{c} -- are between 100 and 200 \mu\Omega cm, which gives a mean free path of 300 to 150 A, respectively. The infrared measurement of a thick, optimally doped 214 film (8200 A) close to T_{c} , led to an estimate of l\approx 275 A a value that is in agreement with the resistivity measurement. From these estimates, it is clear that l is much too large compared to the quoted short coherence length in these cuprates, to explain the observed upturn in \lambda .

### 3D _xy_

The results are consistent with the analysis of thermal fluctuations close to T_{c} (3D _xy_ critical behavior), which leads to a relation between the specific-heat singularity, \lambda and T_{c} .[5] With this relation, \lambda can be derived from the specific-heat singularity and T_{c} , T_{c}\propto\lambda_{0}^{-2}, and an increase of \lambda in the overdoped regime is predicted, _independent of any microscopic mechanism of superconductivity_. Hence, the 3D _xy_ behavior extends over the entire phase-transition line T_{c}(x). Recently this consistency, together with a finite-size effect observed in the temperature dependence of \lambda close to T_{c} , was used to derive the amplitude of the perpendicular real-space phase correlation length \xi_{x0}^{\phi} as a function of doping for the same series of samples .[48]

### n_{s}/m*

On a microscopic basis, \lambda is related to other parameters of the superconducting state, such as the superfluid density n_{s} (not to be confused with the carrier density) and the effective mass of the carriers m*: \lambda^{-2}\propton_{s}/m*. This raises the question whether the superfluid density n_{s} or the effective mass m* is responsible for the increase of \lambda as doping proceeds beyond the optimum value. Various possibilities have already been suggested .[1, 40] To go beyond these arguments, the question to be addressed is whether these additional carriers introduced in the system beyond optimum doping all contribute to the superfluid, i.e., whether n_{s}\rightarrown at zero temperature and/or whether microscopic phenomena (on length scales smaller than \lambda), such as a _chemical_ or an _electronic phase separation_,[49] could actually lower n_{s}. An analysis of the optical conductivity ,[50] the ^{63}Cu relaxation rate, the ^{63}Cu Knight shift ,[51] and of the specific heat [52] suggests that the added carriers in the overdoped regime only partially condense into pairs.

## VII Conclusions

We have shown that the epitaxial driving force imposes a residual tension on the 214 thin films grown on SrTiO_{3}. This tension has significant effects on both the normal state and the superconducting properties of these films, mainly by increasing the resistivity and decreasing the critical temperature. Measurements of the penetration depth as a function of doping reveal a nonmonotonic dependence, previously not observed in this compound. After completion of this work, we have been informed that \muSR measurements of the doping dependence of \lambda in bulk 214 compounds [53] are fully consistent with our observations.
