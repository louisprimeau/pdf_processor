###### Abstract

The crystal structures, magnetic susceptibilities, and electrical resistivities of the quaternary intermetallic compounds LaRh2BxC and LaIr2BxC are reported. Although isostructural with the recently reported superconductors L Ni2BxC and L Pt2BxC (_L_ = La and Y), they are not superconducting at temperatures above 1.4 K. The magnetic-susceptibility measurements reveal densities of states at the Fermi level intermediate to the Ni- and Pt-based compounds.

The recent discovery of superconductivity at temperatures upto 23 K in quaternary intermetallic borocarbides1-4 has sparked renewed interest in searching for superconductivity in intermetallic materials. Compounds with the LuNi2B2C structure type5 have been shown to be responsible for the superconductivity in Ni- and Pt-based borocarbides, and the same structure type, or a non-stoichiometric variation of it, has been proposed to be superconducting at 23 K in Y-Pd-B-C.6,7 The structure consists of tetrahedrally bonded, square T2B2 layers (_T_ = transition metal), separated by square rocksaltlike _LC_ layers. Very strong boron-carbon bonds join the two layers. We have been exploring the extent to which this structure type forms, as the related ThCr2Si2 structure type is found for many ternary intermetallic compounds. Investigations of compositions of the type _LT_2B2C with L = La and Y, and T = Fe, Ru, Co, Rh, Ir, Cu, Ag, and Au, showed the presence of the LuNi2B2C structure type in single-phase form only for LaRh2B2C and LaIr2B2C. In this report we briefly describe their synthesis, crystal structures, and elementary physical properties.

Starting materials were lanthanide metal shavings (99.99%), Rh and Ir powder (99.99%), and coarse C (99.99%) and B (99.6%) powder. Samples of 0.5-g total weight were first pressed into 0.25-in.-diam pellets. They were then arc melted under Ar on a standard water-cooled copper hearth. They were melted three times, with the button turned over between each melt. There was good crystal growth in the buttons, and LaIr2B2C and LaRh2B2C were essentially single phase as melted. The arc-melted buttons were wrapped in Ta foil, sealed in evacuated quartz tubes, and annealed at 1050 degC for several days.

As we found for the _L_Pt2B2C analogs,4,8 the stability of the LuNi2B2C structure type in _L_Ir2B2C and _L_Rh2B2C was best for the larger rare earths. Single-phase materials for L = Y could not be synthesized under our conditions. Preliminary experiments to determine the stability of the phase for intermediate rare-earth sizes were performed by arc melting and annealing samples of composition La1-_x_Y_x_T_2B2C, for x = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0. For T = Ir, the Y solubility limit was lower than 0.25, probably close to x = 0.1, based on the small but significant shift in the unit-cell parameter for the LuNi2B2C type phase in the multiple-phase sample at x = 0.25, suggesting stability for the Ir-based analogs only for the largest rare earths. For the Rh-based samples, single-phase material of composition La0.75Y0.25Rh2B2C was obtained. The material of composition La0.5Y0.5Rh2C was multiple phase, as were all samples at higher-Y contents. The LuNi2B2C-type pattern persisted even to the solely Y-containing material, where it accounted for approximately 50% of the sample. The lattice parameters were a0 = 3.768 and c0 = 10.305 A, showing the decrease in a0 and increase in c0 on going from larger to smaller rare earth expected in this structure type5 (for LaRh2B2C, a0 = 3.906 and c0 = 10.246 A). Annealing the La1-_x_Y_xRh2B2C samples for 0.5 <= x <= 1.0 at 1200 degC overnight did not significantly change the phase purity. This suggests that either higher-temperature annealing conditions would be required to successfully obtain the complete La-Y solid solution in single-phase form or that some type of nonstoichiometry of the LuNi_{2}B_{2}C phase is occurring for the smaller rare earth, e.g., boron or carbon deficiency. We note that the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type phase YRh_{2}B_{2} has not been reported, although the Y-Rh-B system has been studied extensively,[9] and so the tetragonal body-centered phase observed in YRh_{2}B_{2}C is likely to indeed be a borocarbide.

Small single crystals of LaRh_{2}B_{2}C and LaIr_{2}B_{2}C were removed from the arc-melted and annealed boules for crystal-structure determination. Data were collected on an Enraf-Norius diffractometer using graphite-monochromated Mo K\alpha radiation. Lattice parameters were obtained by determining the absolute 2\theta values at high angles of 35 reflections. A Gaussian integration absorption correction was applied to the intensity data, and the structure was refined using the hrcvax programs.[10] The results for both LaRh_{2}B_{2}C and LaIr_{2}B_{2}C are summarized in Table 1. The crystal structures are of the ideal LuNi_{2}B_{2}C type. Consistent with the fact that excellent-quality single-phase polycrystalline materials can be synthesized at the ideal LaT_{2}B_{2}C stoichiometry, there is no indication of nonstoichiometry for either phase in the structural refinements.

The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility for both materials was measured between 4.2 and 300 K in a commercial superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer. The magnetic moments M were measured in a series of fields, up to 40 kOe, to ensure that the susceptibilities were derived from linear M (H) relationships. The raw data measured in this way are presented in the inset to Fig. 1, with data also presented for the superconducting single-phase materials LuNi_{2}B_{2}C and LaPt_{1,7}Au_{0.3}B_{3}C.[8] Small amounts of magnetic impurity phases are present in the samples and give rise to slight upturns of \chi(T) at low temperatures. The main panel of Fig. 1 presents intrinsic magnetic susceptibilities for all the materials, obtained by subtracting the contributions of the magnetic impurities. The observed temperature-independent magnetic susceptibilities are the sum of the susceptibilities from the core electrons (\chi_{\rm core}), Van Vleck-type paramagnetism (\chi_{\rm w}, here considered to be negligible), and conduction electron paramagnetism (\chi_{\rm ee}). The values of \chi_{\rm ee} determined from the experimen

  tal susceptibilities and \chi_{\rm core} obtained from standard tables are shown in Table 2. Comparison of \chi_{\rm ce} and the electronic density of states measured by specific heat in LuNi_{2}B_{2}C and LaPt_{1.7}Au_{0.3}B_{2}C (Ref. [11]) has shown that the values for \chi_{\rm ce} are a good measure of the electronic density of states for each material, i.e., the ratio of \chi_{\rm ce} and the Sommerfeld constant \gamma is very close to the free electron value. The new materials LaRh_{2}B_{2}C and LaIr_{2}B_{2}C, therefore, have densities of states intermediate to those of the superconducting analogs.

Temperature-dependent resistivities for LaRh_{2}B_{2}C and LaIr_{2}B_{2}C are presented in Fig. 2, measured in the standard four-probe geometry on polycrystalline pieces. Although the resistivities are comparable (60-70 \mu\Omega cm) at room temperature, the Rh sample has a considerably better resistance ratio, reaching a resistivity of approximately 10 \mu\Omega cm at 4 K. The shapes of \rho(\tau), especially when compared to Ni(3), suggest a tendency to resistivity saturation at higher temperatures, perhaps due to less perfect crystal quality in the present materials.

In conclusion, investigation of the range of occurrence of the LuNi_{2}B_{2}C structure type for transition metals in columns VIII A and I B indicated that the structure type is stable for materials based on Rh and Ir for the large rare earths. A related phase was also observed for LaCo_{2}B_{2}C, but the material was not obtained in single phase form. Due to the fact that LaCo_{2}B_{2} occurs in the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure type,[12, 13] there exists the possibility that a LaCo_{2}B_{2}C_{x} solid solution series could form: further investigation will be necessary to clarify the stoichiometry of the borocarbide phase. Although their densities of states at the Fermi level are comparable to those of the superconducting materials of the same structure type, LaRh_{2}B_{2}C and LaIr_{2}B_{2}C are not superconducting down to our lowest measurement temperature, 1.4 K. This may be due to the significantly different band filling expected: band-structure calculations suggest that the Fermi level would fall in a different position in the electronic band scheme.[14] More detailed comparison of superconducting and nonsuperconducting materials in the new LuNi_{2}B_{2}C structure type will help elucidate the roles played by the differing electronic, magnetic, and structural components in the microscopic mechanism for superconductivity.
