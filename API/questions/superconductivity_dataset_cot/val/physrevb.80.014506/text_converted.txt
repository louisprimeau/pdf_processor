###### Abstract

Resistance measurements of a "111" type superconductor Li_(x)FeAs
(x=0.8, 1.0, 1.1) were performed at high pressure. The superconductivity
transition temperature (T_(c)) is found to decrease almost linearly with
increasing pressure and the pressure derivative, dT_(c)/dP, becomes
smaller with increasing Li content. Electron spin resonance experiment
at ambient pressure on a stoichometric sample shows gradual decrease in
the spin moment and the loss of coherence of spin coupling as the
temperature is lowered. A very weak Fe local moment is observed when the
temperature is lowered to T_(c). _In situ_ synchrotron radiation powder
x-ray diffraction at high pressure shows changes in the resistivity are
not related to a structural transition.

## I Introduction

The recent discovery of LaO_(1 − x)F_(x)FeAs (Ref. 1) ("1111" type) with
a superconducting transition temperature (T_(c)) of 26 K has stimulated
extensive interest in the search for other iron arsenide superconductor
systems. Through chemical substitution, "1111" type compounds with T_(c)
as high as 50 K (Refs. 2-6) have been synthesized. A closely related
group of compounds of chemical formula AFe₂As₂ (A=Ba, Sr, and Ca, "122"
type) with a tetragonal ThCr₂Si₂ structure were later found to be also
superconductive by chemical doping. For example, partial substitution of
Ba by K in BaFe₂As₂ has led to a superconducting T_(c) of 38 K. [7]
Similar to the high T_(c)-layered cuprate superconductors, the iron
arsenide systems cannot be explained by the conventional BCS theory. It
is now generally believed that the superconductivity is related to the
spin in the system. Very recently, a superconducting LiFeAs with T_(c)
of 18 K (Ref. 8) was found by one of the authors. This compound
crystallizes in a tetragonal Cu₂Sb-type structure [9] and is composed of
Fe₂As₂ layers linked by edge-sharing FeAs₄ tetrahedra (Fig. 1). This
superconductor system is named "111" type following the convention of
the "1111" or "122" types mentioned above. Almost simultaneously,
several groups have also investigated and reported the electronic
structure and superconductivity of LiFeAs. [10, 11, 12]

Chemical substitution has been used to tune T_(c) by introducing charge
carriers or to alter the electronic structure in ReFeAsO (Re= rare earth
metals) and AFe₂As₂. Besides chemical substitution, pressure is another
effective way to modify T_(c) by changing the carrier concentration and
exchange interaction through the compressed lattice. Soon after the
discovery of superconductivity in LaFeAsO, [1] enhancement of T_(c) from
26 to 43 K was achieved in LaOFeAs at 4 GPa. [13] In the past,
high-pressure studies have provided unequivocal evidence showing that
the superconductivity in cuprate superconductors is primarily related to
electron pairing in the Cu-O plane. If this was the case in iron
arsenide systems, it is expected that the superconducting transition
temperature will also be more sensitive to Fe-Fe distances in the FeAs
layers than between the layers. Therefore measurement of the electrical
properties under pressure should offer insight to understand the
superconducting mechanism of the iron arsenide systems. Pressure-tuned
superconductivity of

several "1111" type and "122" type compounds have already been reported
in the literature.[6, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]

LiFeAs has some notable features different from "1111" type or "122"
type compounds. While all undoped "1111" and "122" type compounds
exhibit spin-density wave (SDW) transition,[14, 23, 24, 25, 26] it is
absent in LiFeAs.[8, 10, 11, 12] Although the superconductivity
transition temperature in LiFeAs is comparatively low, the structural
simplicity of this compound makes it a convenient model to study the
superconducting mechanism both by theory and experiment. The absence of
SDW state in LiFeAs suggested that the superconducting behavior may be
associated with a marginally ordered magnetic state. The objectives of
this investigation are (i) to study the effect of pressure on the
electrical conductivity and T_(c);(ii) to explore whether pressure can
alternate the magnetic and crystal structure, and (iii) to characterize
the spin (magnetic) state. For these purposes, _in situ_ resistance
measurements and synchrotron radiation x-ray powder diffraction were
performed using the diamond anvil cell (DAC) technique. In addition,
variable temperature electron spin resonance measurements at ambient
pressure were performed. Resistance measurements were performed on three
samples Li,FeAs with x = 0.8, 1.0, 1.1. Stoichiometric LiFeAs (x = 1.0)
samples were used in the ESR and diffraction experiments. The ESR
spectra of potential impurities FeAs and FeAs₂ were also measured. The
effect of pressure on the superconductivity transition temperature and
possible changes in the electronic structure driven by pressure will be
discussed.

## II II. Experimental Details

"111" type LiFeAs was prepared from mixing appropriate ratio of starting
materials Li (99.9

Variable temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments
were conducted on stoichiometric LiFeAs, Fe₂As, and FeAs. The
measurements were performed with a Bruker EMX X-band spectrometer fitted
with an Oxford liquid-helium cryostat. The operating conditions were
optimized at microwave frequency of 9.35 GHz, power of 2 mW, modulation
of 2 G, and liquid-helium flow rate of 1 /h. The samples were kept under
argon and sealed in an EPR tube with a lock tight valve.

Superconducting transitions were investigated under high pressure. The
resistance was measured by four-probe electrical conductivity methods in
a diamond anvil cell made of CuBe alloy. Pressure was generated by a
pair of diamonds with 600-μm-diameter culet. A sample hole of 300 μm
diameter was drilled in the gasket after its thickness was reduced from
250 to  30 μm by preindentation. Then it was covered with a thin cubic
boron nitride (BN) layer for electrical insulation between the gasket
and the electrodes. Gold wire of 18 μm diameter was used as electrode
leads. The sizes of all the three samples were about 200 x 100 × 20 μm³.
The pressure was determined by a standard ruby-fluorescence method at
room temperature before and after each cooling down. For the x = 1.0
sample, pressure was applied up to 18 GPa. The results of the other two
samples (x = 0.8, 1.1) were almost identical to that of x = 1.0. For the
x = 1.1 sample, pressure was applied above 30 GPa while for the x = 0.8
sample, pressure was applied up to 38 GPa.

To study the effect of pressure on the structure of LiFeAs, angle
dispersive x-ray diffraction (XRD) were performed at the HXMA beamline
of the Canadian Light Source.[27] In the XRD experiments, a
stoichiometric LiFeAs (x = 1.0) sample was loaded in gasketed diamond
anvil cells without pressure-transmitting medium since LiFeAs itself is
relatively "soft" as compared with copper oxide superconductors and the
compound is very hygroscopic sensitive precluding the use of silicon
oil. The wavelength used in the experiment was 0.5091 A.

## III III. Results and Discussions

Figure 2(a) shows a comparison of the full range EPR spectra of LiFeAs
from 70 to 13 K. The broad features of a paramagnetic Fe system at g =
2.95, 2.001, and 0.95 become prominent at 70 K. As the temperature is
lowered, the relaxation time lengthens and the main bands become more

prominent. In the intermediate region between 50 and 70 K, distinct
features due to spin coupling are evident. However these patterns become
very weak as the temperature is lowered below 50 K. At 30 K an
additional high-spin band at g = 4.3 is observed. The overall intensity
of Fe spin decreases as the temperature is lowered accompanying with an
overall decrease in the paramagnetism. A large zero-filed absorption is
observed as the LiFeAs becomes superconducting when the temperature is
below 18 K. Figure 2(b) shows the highly resolved features of a
transitional state in the high-field region as the temperature is
lowered from 70 to 42 K. As the temperature is increased from 42 to 70 K
the bands reappear with increasing intensity to approximately 52 K and
then broaden into the large high-temperature background at 60 K. The
disappearance of these high-field bands as the temperature drops below
42 K is unexpected since bands will normally sharpen as the temperature
is decreased. This is the result of decrease in spin-spin and spin-orbit
interactions and an overall decrease in the paramagnetism. When the
temperature is decreased, spin-orbit interactions are observed resulting
in bands sharpening. Approaching the superconductivity temperature
resulted in a reduction in unpaired spin density at the Fe sites and a
reduction in the overall paramagnetism. In Fig. 2(a), the EPR spectra of
Fe₂As and FeAs, at the lowest achievable temperature, at 8 and 6 K,
respectively, are overlaid. These spectra represent the signal obtained
over the temperature range and clearly show that a large zero-field
absorption at temperatures below 13 K is not present. This indicates
that the presence of Fe₂As and FeAs as contaminants could only
contribute to the overall background of the EPR spectra and did not
contribute to the absorption structures observed in LiFeAs. A very small
magnetic moment in LiFeAs is consistent with the observation made in
other iron arsenide superconductors.

Figure 3(a) shows the measured resistance of the x = 1.0 sample as a
function of temperature at different pressures. Different from the
"1111" type _R_FeAsO or "122" type _A_Fe₂As₂ superconductors, [23, 24,
25, 26] no clear evidence of a SDW phase transition characterized by a
rapid decrease in resistance was found in LiFeAs. LiFeAs becomes
superconductive at ambient pressure at 18 K. Figure 3(b) shows the
superconducting transition is suppressed by increasing pressure. As
shown in Fig. 4, for the x = 1.0 sample, the superconductivity critical
temperature (_Tc_) is found to decrease linearly with increasing
pressure with _dT__c_/_dP_ = -1.38 K/GPa. The Li_(x)FeAs samples with x
= 0.8 and 1.1 exhibit the same trend with _dT__c_/_dP_ = -1.48 K/GPa and
-1.22 K/GPa, respectively. For the x = 0.8 sample, the superconductivity
transition reappears at low pressure once unloaded from 11, 20, and 38
GPa.

The lithium content seems to have little effect on the superconductivity
transition temperature in LiFeAs at ambient pressure. This observation
supports a first-principles calculation showing there is little change
in density of states (DOS) at Fermi surface with the Li content. [28]
Surprisingly the _Tc_ seems to depend on the Li content under pressure.
From the experimental data, it is found that _dT__c_/_dP_ becomes
smaller with increasing Li content, changing from -1.48 K/GPa in
Li0.8FeAs to -1.38 K/GPa in Li1.0FeAs and then -1.22 K/GPa in Li1.1FeAs.
The high Li mobility of Li in the solid may facilitate the formation of
vacancies at the Li sites. Increasing nominal Li content reduces the Li
vacancies in Li_(x)FeAs. Therefore the reduced _dT__c_/_dP_ with
increasing Li content shown in Fig. 4 indicates that the pressure
response to the Li vacancies is related to _Tc_ change. The pressure
effect on _Tc_ for x = 1.0 sample is compared with other iron arsenide
superconductors in Fig. 5. Two general behaviors of pressure on the _Tc_
were observed in these iron arsenide superconductors. First, the _Tc_ is
enhanced by initial compression. At higher pressures the _Tc_ will then
decrease. This behavior is observed in LaFeAsO1-_F__x_ (Refs. [13, 16])
and _A_Fe₂As₂ (_A_ = Ca, Sr, Ba). [17] The second is that the _Tc_ is
suppressed by pressure. This is observed in LiFeAs and in _R_FeAsO,
where R is a rare-earth element with smaller ion radius. [6, 15]

Both the intralayer and interlayer Fe-Fe distances are found to affect
the superconducting transition temperature in the iron arsenide
superconductors. Cooper pairings only exist within a thin shell at the
Fermi level. In the iron arsenide compounds the density of states at
Fermi surface is dominated by the Fe 3d orbitals. Therefore it is
reasonable to

expect superconductivity in these compounds is sensitive to the lattice
geometry. Following the cuprate superconductors, it is reasonable to
assume the in-plane Fe-Fe distance is more important in affecting the
T_(c) in iron arsenide superconductors. From experimental observations,
it is apparent that there may be an optimal in-plane Fe-Fe distance,
$d_{\rm opt}$, where T_(c) is maximized. For superconductors when the
zero pressure in-plane Fe-Fe distance is larger than $d_{\rm opt}$,
T_(c) will be enhanced under pressure. This effect was manifested in
LaFeAsO where a large La ion radius results in larger ambient lattice
parameters and T_(c) was found to increase on compression. In contrast,
in RFeAsO, where R is a rare-earth element with smaller ion radius than
La, the Fe-Fe distance is smaller than the $d_{\rm opt}$ and resulted in
the suppression of the T_(c) on initial compression. Owing to the very
small lithium ionic radius, the in-plane Fe-Fe distance in LiFeAs is the
shortest among the iron arsenide compounds. Therefore, comparing to
other iron arsenide compounds, LiFeAs has already been "precompressed"
by chemical pressure. This may be the reason that pressure-induced
increase in resistance at higher pressure for "111" LiFeAs was not
observed in "1111" or "122".

There are two unusual features in the R-T relationship for the
Li_(x)FeAs sample with different Li concentration. Usually, the
resistivity should decrease with increasing pressure. Furthermore, the
slope dR/dT of LiFeAs with increasing pressure is expected to be
parallel to each other. This is not the case in Li_(x)FeAs. As shown in
Fig. 6, the R vs T curves are very sensitive to the pressures. First of
all, at low temperature (<120 K), the rate of change in the resistance
vs temperature (dR/dT)_(P) at low pressure(e.g., 11 GPa) is much larger
than at high pressure (e.g., 35 GPa). A second unusual feature is that
the resistance of the sample at higher temperature increases at higher
pressure. For example, the sample measured at 31.5 GPa has a lower
resistance than that measured at 35 GPa at room temperature. A similar
behavior is also observed in the stoichiometric in L_(1.0)FeAs sample.
As shown in Fig. 7, the resistance decreases much faster with increasing
pressure at high temperature (290 K) than at low temperature (30 K) and
the resistance does not continue to decrease when the pressure is above
12 GPa for both curves.

Usually, the resistance and pressure are anticorrelated, that is, the
higher the pressure is, the lower the resistivity will be. This is not
the case here. The resistivity of the LiFeAs sample at 11 GPa below 120
K is lower than that of the sample measured at 16 GPa. This unusual
observation may be related to local spin fluctuations. It has been
suggested that the ordering state of strip-type antiferromagnetic phase
is very sensitive to the in-plane Fe-Fe distance.[29] Reduction in the
iron distance will improve the itinerant electronic characteristics that
tend to suppress the long-range magnetic order. The in-plane Fe-Fe
distance in LiFeAs is likely in the region competitive with the
long-distance mag

netic order that can easily be suppressed by Li vacancies leading to a
local magnetic order. Pressure increases the local magnetic order by
compressing the in-plane Fe-Fe distance giving rise to a higher
resistance. This result provides indirect evidence that magnetic
interactions remain effect on LiFeAs.

To study the effect of pressure on the structure, synchrotron powder XRD
experiments were performed on a sample with nominal stoichiometric
LiFeAs. XRD patterns at selected pressures were plotted in Fig. 8. These
diffraction patterns can be indexed to the known PA/mmn structure as
shown in 0.6 GPa case, except some minor diffraction peaks from an
impurity. For example, the diffraction peak located between (110) and
(111) of LiFeAs came from (111) of FeAs. The peak splitting at around
15^(∘) is due to shift of the (110) peak of the stainless-steel gasket
surrounding the sample. No structural change is observed for pressure up
to 20 GPa. So the diffraction results clearly show that the suppression
of superconductivity and the unusual resistance change with pressure are
not related to a structural phase transition.

In summary, ESR experiments suggest that LiFeAs exists weak local
moment. Pressure is found to suppress superconductivity for Li,FeAs
superconductors, where higher Li content tends to release the effect.
The turning of R∼P curve at higher pressure suggests the magnetic
interactions remain effective in "111" type LiFeAs superconductor. Both
the suppression of superconductivity and the abnormal resistance change
are not related to the occurrence of a structural phase transition. It
is noteworthy that there are two low-pressure measurements reported
recently supporting the present observation on the suppression of the
superconductivity transition temperature in LiFeAs. [30, 31]
