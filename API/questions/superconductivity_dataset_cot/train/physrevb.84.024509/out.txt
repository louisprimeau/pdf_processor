###### Abstract

The results of a ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy study between 2.0 and 294 K of superconducting Ba(Fe0.961Rh0.039)2As2 are reported. The main component of the electric field gradient tensor at 294 K is shown to be positive and its increase with decreasing temperature is well described by a T^{3/2} power-law relation. The shape of the Mossbauer spectra below the Neel temperature T_{N}=55.5(1) K is shown to result from the presence of doping-induced disorder rather than of incommensurate spin-density-wave order. The measured hyperfine magnetic field reaches its maximum value at the critical temperature T_{c}=14 K and then decreases by 4.2% upon further cooling to 2.0 K. This constitutes direct evidence of the coexistence of and competition between superconductivity and magnetic order. The extrapolated value of the Fe magnetic moment at 0 K is determined to be 0.35(1) \mu_{B}. The Debye temperature of Ba(Fe0.961Rh0.039)2As2 is found to be 357(3) K.

## I Introduction

The recent discovery of superconductivity in iron-pnictide compounds [1, 2] has triggered intense research into its nature and origin. It has renewed interest in the relationship between antiferromagnetism found in these superconductors and superconductivity [3]. In particular, the possibility of incommensurability of the antiferromagnetic order is still an unsettled issue for the _R_OFeAs (R= rare earth) and AFe2As2 (A= Ba, Sr, Ca, K) superconductors.

On the theoretical side, various theoretical models suggest the coexistence of superconductivity and incommensurate antiferromagnetic order in doped _R_OFeAs and AFe2As2 superconductors [4]. Density-functional theory calculations [5] invoke incommensurability to explain the anisotropy of the spin excitation spectrum of the Ba(Fe0.926Co0.074)2As2 superconductor [6]. On the experimental side, neutron-diffraction experiments did not detect any incommensurability within their resolution window [7]. Also, x-ray resonant magnetic diffraction measurements of the Ba(Fe0.953Co0.047)2As2 superconductor [8] and ^{75}As NMR measurements of the Ba(Fe1-xNi)x)2As2 superconductors [9] found no evidence of incommensurability. On the other hand, muon spin relaxation experiments of the LaFeAs0.97F0.03 superconductor [10], ^{75}As and ^{59}Co NMR measurements of the Ba(Fe1-xCo)x)2As2 superconductors [11, 12] and ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy (MS) measurements of the Ba(Fe1-xCo)x)2As2 (Ref. [13]), Ba(Fe1-xNi)x)2As2 (Ref. [14]), and EuFe2(As1-xPt)2 (Ref. [15]) superconductors, and of the parent compounds AFe2As2 (A = Ca, Ba, Eu) [16], were all interpreted in terms of incommensurate spin-density-wave (SDW) order. Also, recent muon spin rotation and infrared spectroscopy experiments on BaFe1.89Co0.11As2 suggested incommensurate SDW order [17]. Very recently, well-defined incommensurate spin fluctuations have been observed in the hole-overdoped KFe2As2 superconductor [18].

The MS technique is, in principle, a valuable tool for study of the possibilities of incommensurate magnetic order in a given compound. This is because incommensurability results in an unusual shape of the Mossbauer spectra [19, 20]. Here we use ^{57}Fe MS to identify the nature of antiferromagnetic ordering in the Ba(Fe0.961Rh0.039)2As2 superconductor. We show that the shape of the high-quality ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectra at temperatures below T_{N} is more likely to result from doping-induced disorder than from incommensurate SDW order. We also observe, for the first time with the MS technique, a 4.2% reduction in the hyperfine magnetic field on cooling through the critical temperature T_{c}.

## II Experimental methods

Single crystals of Ba(Fe0.961Rh0.039)2As2 used in this study were grown from an FeAs self-flux using a standard high-temperature-solution growth technique [21]. The chemical composition of the crystals was determined by using wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy [21].

Structural, magnetic, and transport properties of Ba(Fe0.961Rh0.039)2As2 were determined from x-ray and neutron diffraction, magnetization, and electrical resistivity measurements [21, 22]. Ba(Fe0.961Rh0.039)2As2 crystallizes in a tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type crystal structure [space group 14/mmm (No. 139)] and undergoes a structural phase transition to an orthorhombic crystal structure [space group Fmmm (No. 69)] at T_{S}=59 K [22]. The compound studied is a superconductor with T_{c}=14 K and orders antiferromagnetically at T_{N}=54 K [22].

^{57}Fe Mossbauer measurements were conducted using a standard Mossbauer spectrometer operating in sine mode and a ^{57}Co(Rh) source at room temperature. The spectrometer was calibrated with a 6.35-\mum-thick \alpha-Fe foil [23] and the spectra were folded. As-grown crystals of Ba(Fe0.961Rh0.039)2As2 are in the form of plates, with the tetragonal c-axis perpendicular to the plate. They could easily be cleaved, using a scalel, into many flat plates of \sim50-\mum thickness. The Mossbauer absorber was made from several such plates by attaching  them with Apiezon N grease to a high-purity, 8-\mum-thick Al disk container to ensure a uniform temperature over the whole absorber. The plates overlapped slightly to avoid gaps between them. The direction of the \gamma rays was perpendicular to the surface of the plates, that is, parallel to the c axis. The Mossbauer absorber thickness of 50 \mum corresponds to an effective thickness parameter [24]T = 5.1f_{a}, where f_{a} is the Lamb-Mossbauer factor of the absorber. Since T> 1, the resonance line shape of the Mossbauer spectrum was described using a transmission integral formula. [25] The source line width \Gamma_{s} = 0.107 mm/s and the background-corrected Debye-Waller factor of the source f_{s}[25], which were derived from the fit of the Mossbauer spectrum of the Fe foil, were used. As the electric quadrupole interaction is significantly smaller than the magnetic dipole interaction in the compound studied, the ^{57}Fe Zeeman spectra at temperatures below T_{N} were analyzed using a first-order perturbation treatment. [24]

## III Experimental results and discussion

The ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectrum of Ba(Fe_{0.96}Rh_{0.039})_{2}As_{2} at room temperature, that is, far above T_{N}, is shown in Fig. 1. It has the appearance of a single narrow line. The Fe atoms in the studied compound are located at the 4d site (tetragonal space group I4/mmm) with the point symmetry \overline{4}m2, which ensures an axially symmetric (the asymmetry parameter \eta = 0), nonzero electric field gradient (EFG) tensor at that site and, hence, a nonzero electric quadrupole hyperfine interaction. [24] The spectrum in Fig. 1 was fitted with an asymmetric quadrupole doublet and the intensity ratio of the higher-energy line to the lower-energy line of the doublet obtained from the fit was close to 3:1. As the \overline{4}m2 point symmetry of the Fe(4d) site requires that the principal axis of the EFG tensor lie along the crystallographic c axis, the intensity ratio 3:1 of the component lines of the doublet indicates that the principal component of the EFG tensor V_{cz} is positive. [24] The values of the absorber line width \Gamma_{a}, the quadrupole splitting \Delta = \frac{1}{2}eQV_{cz}, where e is the proton charge and Q is the electric quadrupole moment of the ^{57}Fe nucleus, [26] and the center shift \delta (relative to \alpha-Fe at 298 K) obtained from the fit are, respectively, 0.098(2), 0.121(3), and 0.431(5) mm/s. The \Delta value of 0.098(2) mm/s implies that V_{cz} = 6.26(15) \times 10^{20} V/m^{2}. The value of \Delta is, within experimental error, the same as that of 0.092(4) mm/s for the parent compound BaFe_{2}As_{2}. [14]

Fourteen ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectra of Ba(Fe_{0.961}Rh_{0.039})_{2}As_{2} (not shown here) recorded at temperatures between 280.3 and 57.3 K, at which no magnetic dipole hyperfine interaction [24] is present, are very similar to the spectrum shown in Fig. 1. They

  were fitted with an asymmetric quadrupole doublet pattern. The values of \Delta derived from the fits of these spectra and of the spectrum in Fig. 1 are shown in Fig. 2. One can observe a clear increase in \Delta with decreasing temperature (Fig. 2). Such a temperature dependence of \Delta is found in many noncubic metallic systems [27] and is well described by the empirical equation

\[\Delta(T)=\Delta(0)(1-BT^{3/2}),\] (1)

where \Delta(0) is the value of \Delta at 0 K and B is a constant. The fit of the \Delta(T) data (Fig. 2) to Eq. (1) gives \Delta(0)=0.136(1) mm/s and B=5.28(16)\times 10^{-5} K^{-3/2}. The value of B is similar to that found for other metallic systems. [27]

The ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectrum of Ba(Fe_{0.961}Rh_{0.039})_{2}As_{2} at 2.0 K, that is, much below T_{N}, is shown in Fig. 3(a). The shape of this spectrum is completely different from the six-line Zeeman pattern expected for an antiferromagnetic

  compound in which Fe atoms occupy one crystallographic site.[24] It must certainly result from the presence of a wide distribution P(H) of hyperfine magnetic fields H. Such a wide distribution P(H) can arise either from significant disorder induced by Rh doping or from the incommensurate modulation of the antiferromagnetic structure, that is, from the incommensurate SDW. We first assume that the distribution P(H) is due to doping-induced disorder and determine its shape by fitting the Mossbauer spectrum in Fig. 3(a) with the constrained version[28] of the model-independent Hess-Rubartsch method.[29] The same values of \delta and the electric quadrupole shift[24]\varepsilon were assumed for the elementary sextets. The best fit (\chi^{2}=0.86) of the Mossbauer spectrum in Fig. 3(a) was obtained with the distribution P(H) shown in Fig. 3(b). The parameters derived from the fit are \delta=0.564(5) mm/s and \varepsilon=-0.018(2) mm/s, and the average value of the hyperfine magnetic field derived from the P(H) distribution \overline{H}=22.4(1) kOe.

Selected ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectra of Ba(Fe_{0.961}Rh_{0.039})_{2}As_{2} measured at 16 temperatures in the temperature range 4.7-54.9 K, at which the magnetic dipole hyperfine interaction is present,[24] are displayed in Fig. 4. Excellent fits of these spectra (\chi^{2}\approx 0.9) were obtained with the Hesse-Rubartsch method for the P(H) distributions shown in Fig. 4. It is interesting to observe that the trimodal distribution P(H) at low temperatures evolves into a bimodal P(H) at higher temperatures. For a completely random doping-induced disorder one would expect a unimodal distribution P(H). The observed trimodality/bimodality of P(H) seems to indicate a not completely random dopant-induced disorder.

The values of \overline{H} obtained from the determined distributions P(H) at all temperatures are shown in Fig. 5. One can observe the expected increase in \overline{H} with decreasing temperature down to T_{c} (inset in Fig. 5) and then its clear reduction below T_{c}. The value of \overline{H} decreases from 23.4(1) kOe at 13.8 K to 22.1(1) kOe at 2.0 K, a 4.2% reduction. The value of \overline{H} at 0 K, which was derived from the extrapolation of the \overline{H} data in Fig. 5, is \overline{H}(0)=22.3(2) kOe. The occurrence of nonzero \overline{H} values at and below T_{c} clearly demonstrates the coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetic order in the Ba(Fe_{0.961}Rh_{0.039})_{2}As_{2} superconductor.

The measured H is, to a first approximation, proportional to \mu_{\rm Fe} through the relation H=a\mu_{\rm Fe}, where the value of the proportionality constant a is compound specific.[24; 30] In converting \overline{H} to \overline{\mu}_{\rm Fe}, we used a=63 kOe/\mu_{B}, which results from H(4.2 K) = 54.7(1) kOe measured[31] for BaFe_{2}As_{2} and \mu_{\rm Fe}(5 K) = 0.87(3)\mu_{B} determined from the neutron diffraction study of BaFe_{2}As_{2}.[32] Thus, \overline{H}(0)=22.3(2) kOe corresponds to \overline{\mu}_{Fe}(0)=0.35(1)\mu_{B}, which is in good agreement with the value \mu_{\rm Fe}(0)=0.37(10)\mu_{B} determined from the neutron diffraction study of Ba(Fe_{0.961}Rh_{0.039})_{2}As_{2}.[22] The observed reduction of \overline{H}, which is equivalent to the reduction of \overline{\mu}_{\rm Fe}, upon cooling through T_{c} (Fig. 5), observed here for the first time using MS, constitutes clear evidence of the competition between superconductivity and the long-range antiferromagnetic order.

The \overline{H} data (Fig. 5) could be fitted to the power law over the limited range of temperatures (34.7 K\leqslant T\leqslant 54.9 K). The fit yielded the the Neel temperature T_{N}=55.5(1) K, which

  is close to the value of 54 K determined from the neutron diffraction study.[22]

Let us now assume that the distribution P(H) resulting in the 2.0 K Mossbauer spectrum shown in Fig. 6(a) is caused by the incommensurate SDW. Assuming a collinear antiferromagnetic structure (the Fe magnetic moments are aligned antiferromagnetically along the orthorhombic a axis)[22] and collinearity of the Fe magnetic moment and H, one can

  describe the amplitude of the SDW (the hyperfine magnetic field H) along the x direction parallel to the wave vector \mathbf{q} as a series of odd harmonics,[13; 20]

\[H(qx)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}h_{2i-1}\sin[(2i-1)qx],\] (2)

where h_{2i-1} is the amplitude of the (2i-1)th harmonic, q is the wave number of the SDW, x is the relative position of the Fe atom along the direction of SDW propagation, and n denotes the maximum number of harmonics; the periodicity of the SDW demands that 0\leqslant qx\leqslant 2\pi. A Mossbauer spectrum is then fitted to a set of six-line Zeeman patterns corresponding to H values calculated from Eq. (2) for discrete qx values in the range (0,2\pi). We assume the same values of \delta and \varepsilon for each Zeeman pattern. The resulting distribution P(H) can then be calculated from the amplitudes h_{2i-1} determined from the fit. The average value of H given by Eq. (2) is obviously 0, and so the root-mean-square value of H can be obtained from the expression H_{\text{rms}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}h_{2i-1}^{2}}.[13] The square of H_{\text{rms}} is proportional to the intensity of a magnetic Bragg peak in neutron diffraction.[13] Hence, H_{\text{rms}} is proportional to the magnetic moment \mu_{\text{Fe}} of the Fe atoms.

An excellent fit (\chi^{2}=0.99) of the Mossbauer spectrum in Fig. 6(a) could be achieved using n=5 harmonics (_vide infra_), with the resulting shape of the SDW shown in Fig. 6(b) and the corresponding distribution P(H) shown in Fig. 6(c). The parameters derived from the fit are \delta=0.569(6) mm/s and \varepsilon=-0.021(3) mm/s, the maximum value of the hyperfine magnetic field H_{\text{max}}=43.1(1) kOe, the average value of the hyperfine magnetic field derived from the P(H) distribution \overline{H}=21.5(1) kOe, and H_{\text{rms}}=24.6(2) kOe.

Very good fits (\chi^{2}\approx 1.1) could be obtained also for the ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectra recorded at other temperatures at which the magnetic dipole hyperfine interaction is present (Fig. 7) using n=5 harmonics, and the resulting shape of the SDW and the distribution P(H) are shown for each of these spectra (Fig. 7). The values of the harmonic amplitudes resulting from the fits of all the spectra are shown in Fig. 8. The amplitude of the first harmonic h_{1} is an order of magnitude higher than the absolute values of the higher harmonic amplitudes. It increases slightly with increasing temperature in the temperature range 2-14 K and then decreases monotonically with increasing temperature. The temperature dependence of the amplitudes of higher harmonics h_{3}, h_{5}, h_{7}, and h_{9} is smaller than that of h_{1}.

The temperature dependence of the three hyperfine magnetic fields H_{\text{max}}, \overline{H}, and H_{\text{rms}} obtained from the fits of all the spectra is shown in Fig. 9. These three fields increase with decreasing temperature down to T_{c} (insets in Fig. 9) and then clearly decrease below T_{c}. The value of H_{\text{rms}} decreases from 25.5(2) kOe at 13.8 K to 24.6(2) kOe at 2.0 K, a 3.5% reduction. The value of H_{\text{rms}} at 0 K, which was derived from the extrapolation of the H_{\text{rms}}(T) data in Fig. 9, is H_{\text{rms}}(0)=24.4(2) kOe, which corresponds to \mu_{Fe}(0)=0.39(2)\mu_{B}. The fit of the H_{\text{rms}}(T) data (Fig. 9) to the power law yields T_{N}=55.4(5) K.

The two analyses presented above of the Mossbauer spectra recorded at temperatures at which the magnetic dipole hyperfine interaction occurs show that the fits of these spectra with the distribution P(H) resulting from the dopant-induced disorder are only marginally better than the fits with the distribution P(H) due to the incommensurate SDW. Thus, one cannot state conclusively that the Mossbauer spectra result from the presence of dopant-induced disorder rather than from the existence of incommensurate SDW. One notes, however, that the relevant physical parameters derived from these two analyses have very much the same values and temperature dependencies. The SDW incommensurability is most directly detected in neutron and x-ray resonant scattering experiments. These experiments clearly demonstrate the existence of commensurate antiferromagnetic order in the Ba(Fe_{1-x}T_{x})_{2}As_{2} (T = Co, Ni, Rh) superconductors.[7; 8; 22] It would thus appear that the analysis of the Mossbauer spectra of Ba(Fe_{0.961}Rh_{0.039})_{2}As_{2} in terms of the P(H) distribution resulting from the dopant-induced disorder is more justified than that in terms of the P(H) distribution due to incommensurate SDW.

  The temperature dependence of \delta(T), determined from the fits of the Mossbauer spectra measured at all temperatures, is shown in Fig. 10. \delta(T) is given by

\[\delta(T)=\delta_{0}+\delta_{\rm SOD}(T),\] (3)

where \delta_{0} is the intrinsic isomer shift and \delta_{\rm SOD}(T) is the second-order Doppler (SOD) shift, which depends on the lattice vibrations of the Fe atoms.[24] In terms of the Debye approximation of the lattice vibrations, \delta_{\rm SOD}(T) is expressed[24] in terms of the Debye temperature \Theta_{D} as

\[\delta_{\rm SOD}(T)=-\frac{9}{2}\frac{k_{B}T}{Mc}\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{D}} \right)^{3}\int_{0}^{\Theta_{D}/T}\frac{x^{3}dx}{e^{x}-1},\] (4)

where M is the mass of the Mossbauer nucleus and c is the speed of light. By fitting the experimental data to Eq. (3), the quantities \delta_{0} and \Theta_{D} were found to be 0.564(1) mm/s and 357(3) K, respectively. The value of \Theta_{D} found here is much larger than the reported \Theta_{D} values of 134(1) K,[31] 186 K,[33] and 250 K[34] for BaFe_{2}As_{2} derived from specific heat measurements. The most probable reason for this discrepancy is that a different weight of phonon frequency distribution is used in determining \Theta_{D} from the specific heat data than from the Mossbauer data.[35]

## IV Conclusions

We report the results of ^{57}Fe MS measurements in the temperature range 2-294 K of the superconducting compound Ba(Fe_{0.964}Rh_{0.039})_{2}As_{2}. It is found that V_{zz} at 294 K is positive and that it increases with decreasing temperature according to a T^{3/2} power-law relation. The unusual shape of the magnetically split Mossbauer spectra at temperatures between 2.0 K and T_{N}=55.5(1) K is interpreted in terms of the distribution of the hyperfine magnetic fields resulting from the dopant-induced disorder. The hyperfine magnetic field is found to reach a maximum at T_{c} and then to decrease upon further cooling down to 2.0 K. This is taken as evidence of competition between and the coexistence of magnetic order and superconductivity. The extrapolated magnetic moment of Fe atoms at 0 K is found to be 0.35(1) \mu_{B}. The Debye temperature of Ba(Fe_{0.964}Rh_{0.039})_{2}As_{2} is determined to be 357(3) K.

###### Abstract

The results of a ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy study between 2.0 and 294 K of superconducting Ba(Fe0.961Rh0.039)2As2 are reported. The main component of the electric field gradient tensor at 294 K is shown to be positive and its increase with decreasing temperature is well described by a T^{3/2} power-law relation. The shape of the Mossbauer spectra below the Neel temperature T_{N}=55.5(1) K is shown to result from the presence of doping-induced disorder rather than of incommensurate spin-density-wave order. The measured hyperfine magnetic field reaches its maximum value at the critical temperature T_{c}=14 K and then decreases by 4.2% upon further cooling to 2.0 K. This constitutes direct evidence of the coexistence of and competition between superconductivity and magnetic order. The extrapolated value of the Fe magnetic moment at 0 K is determined to be 0.35(1) \mu_{B}. The Debye temperature of Ba(Fe0.961Rh0.039)2As2 is found to be 357(3) K.

## I Introduction

The recent discovery of superconductivity in iron-pnictide compounds [1, 2] has triggered intense research into its nature and origin. It has renewed interest in the relationship between antiferromagnetism found in these superconductors and superconductivity [3]. In particular, the possibility of incommensurability of the antiferromagnetic order is still an unsettled issue for the _R_OFeAs (R= rare earth) and AFe2As2 (A= Ba, Sr, Ca, K) superconductors.

On the theoretical side, various theoretical models suggest the coexistence of superconductivity and incommensurate antiferromagnetic order in doped _R_OFeAs and AFe2As2 superconductors [4]. Density-functional theory calculations [5] invoke incommensurability to explain the anisotropy of the spin excitation spectrum of the Ba(Fe0.926Co0.074)2As2 superconductor [6]. On the experimental side, neutron-diffraction experiments did not detect any incommensurability within their resolution window [7]. Also, x-ray resonant magnetic diffraction measurements of the Ba(Fe0.953Co0.047)2As2 superconductor [8] and ^{75}As NMR measurements of the Ba(Fe1-xNi)x)2As2 superconductors [9] found no evidence of incommensurability. On the other hand, muon spin relaxation experiments of the LaFeAs0.97F0.03 superconductor [10], ^{75}As and ^{59}Co NMR measurements of the Ba(Fe1-xCo)x)2As2 superconductors [11, 12] and ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy (MS) measurements of the Ba(Fe1-xCo)x)2As2 (Ref. [13]), Ba(Fe1-xNi)x)2As2 (Ref. [14]), and EuFe2(As1-xPt)2 (Ref. [15]) superconductors, and of the parent compounds AFe2As2 (A = Ca, Ba, Eu) [16], were all interpreted in terms of incommensurate spin-density-wave (SDW) order. Also, recent muon spin rotation and infrared spectroscopy experiments on BaFe1.89Co0.11As2 suggested incommensurate SDW order [17]. Very recently, well-defined incommensurate spin fluctuations have been observed in the hole-overdoped KFe2As2 superconductor [18].

The MS technique is, in principle, a valuable tool for study of the possibilities of incommensurate magnetic order in a given compound. This is because incommensurability results in an unusual shape of the Mossbauer spectra [19, 20]. Here we use ^{57}Fe MS to identify the nature of antiferromagnetic ordering in the Ba(Fe0.961Rh0.039)2As2 superconductor. We show that the shape of the high-quality ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectra at temperatures below T_{N} is more likely to result from doping-induced disorder than from incommensurate SDW order. We also observe, for the first time with the MS technique, a 4.2% reduction in the hyperfine magnetic field on cooling through the critical temperature T_{c}.

## II Experimental methods

Single crystals of Ba(Fe0.961Rh0.039)2As2 used in this study were grown from an FeAs self-flux using a standard high-temperature-solution growth technique [21]. The chemical composition of the crystals was determined by using wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy [21].

Structural, magnetic, and transport properties of Ba(Fe0.961Rh0.039)2As2 were determined from x-ray and neutron diffraction, magnetization, and electrical resistivity measurements [21, 22]. Ba(Fe0.961Rh0.039)2As2 crystallizes in a tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type crystal structure [space group 14/mmm (No. 139)] and undergoes a structural phase transition to an orthorhombic crystal structure [space group Fmmm (No. 69)] at T_{S}=59 K [22]. The compound studied is a superconductor with T_{c}=14 K and orders antiferromagnetically at T_{N}=54 K [22].

^{57}Fe Mossbauer measurements were conducted using a standard Mossbauer spectrometer operating in sine mode and a ^{57}Co(Rh) source at room temperature. The spectrometer was calibrated with a 6.35-\mum-thick \alpha-Fe foil [23] and the spectra were folded. As-grown crystals of Ba(Fe0.961Rh0.039)2As2 are in the form of plates, with the tetragonal c-axis perpendicular to the plate. They could easily be cleaved, using a scalel, into many flat plates of \sim50-\mum thickness. The Mossbauer absorber was made from several such plates by attaching  them with Apiezon N grease to a high-purity, 8-\mum-thick Al disk container to ensure a uniform temperature over the whole absorber. The plates overlapped slightly to avoid gaps between them. The direction of the \gamma rays was perpendicular to the surface of the plates, that is, parallel to the c axis. The Mossbauer absorber thickness of 50 \mum corresponds to an effective thickness parameter [24]T = 5.1f_{a}, where f_{a} is the Lamb-Mossbauer factor of the absorber. Since T> 1, the resonance line shape of the Mossbauer spectrum was described using a transmission integral formula. [25] The source line width \Gamma_{s} = 0.107 mm/s and the background-corrected Debye-Waller factor of the source f_{s}[25], which were derived from the fit of the Mossbauer spectrum of the Fe foil, were used. As the electric quadrupole interaction is significantly smaller than the magnetic dipole interaction in the compound studied, the ^{57}Fe Zeeman spectra at temperatures below T_{N} were analyzed using a first-order perturbation treatment. [24]

## III Experimental results and discussion

The ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectrum of Ba(Fe_{0.96}Rh_{0.039})_{2}As_{2} at room temperature, that is, far above T_{N}, is shown in Fig. 1. It has the appearance of a single narrow line. The Fe atoms in the studied compound are located at the 4d site (tetragonal space group I4/mmm) with the point symmetry \overline{4}m2, which ensures an axially symmetric (the asymmetry parameter \eta = 0), nonzero electric field gradient (EFG) tensor at that site and, hence, a nonzero electric quadrupole hyperfine interaction. [24] The spectrum in Fig. 1 was fitted with an asymmetric quadrupole doublet and the intensity ratio of the higher-energy line to the lower-energy line of the doublet obtained from the fit was close to 3:1. As the \overline{4}m2 point symmetry of the Fe(4d) site requires that the principal axis of the EFG tensor lie along the crystallographic c axis, the intensity ratio 3:1 of the component lines of the doublet indicates that the principal component of the EFG tensor V_{cz} is positive. [24] The values of the absorber line width \Gamma_{a}, the quadrupole splitting \Delta = \frac{1}{2}eQV_{cz}, where e is the proton charge and Q is the electric quadrupole moment of the ^{57}Fe nucleus, [26] and the center shift \delta (relative to \alpha-Fe at 298 K) obtained from the fit are, respectively, 0.098(2), 0.121(3), and 0.431(5) mm/s. The \Delta value of 0.098(2) mm/s implies that V_{cz} = 6.26(15) \times 10^{20} V/m^{2}. The value of \Delta is, within experimental error, the same as that of 0.092(4) mm/s for the parent compound BaFe_{2}As_{2}. [14]

Fourteen ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectra of Ba(Fe_{0.961}Rh_{0.039})_{2}As_{2} (not shown here) recorded at temperatures between 280.3 and 57.3 K, at which no magnetic dipole hyperfine interaction [24] is present, are very similar to the spectrum shown in Fig. 1. They

  were fitted with an asymmetric quadrupole doublet pattern. The values of \Delta derived from the fits of these spectra and of the spectrum in Fig. 1 are shown in Fig. 2. One can observe a clear increase in \Delta with decreasing temperature (Fig. 2). Such a temperature dependence of \Delta is found in many noncubic metallic systems [27] and is well described by the empirical equation

\[\Delta(T)=\Delta(0)(1-BT^{3/2}),\] (1)

where \Delta(0) is the value of \Delta at 0 K and B is a constant. The fit of the \Delta(T) data (Fig. 2) to Eq. (1) gives \Delta(0)=0.136(1) mm/s and B=5.28(16)\times 10^{-5} K^{-3/2}. The value of B is similar to that found for other metallic systems. [27]

The ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectrum of Ba(Fe_{0.961}Rh_{0.039})_{2}As_{2} at 2.0 K, that is, much below T_{N}, is shown in Fig. 3(a). The shape of this spectrum is completely different from the six-line Zeeman pattern expected for an antiferromagnetic

  compound in which Fe atoms occupy one crystallographic site.[24] It must certainly result from the presence of a wide distribution P(H) of hyperfine magnetic fields H. Such a wide distribution P(H) can arise either from significant disorder induced by Rh doping or from the incommensurate modulation of the antiferromagnetic structure, that is, from the incommensurate SDW. We first assume that the distribution P(H) is due to doping-induced disorder and determine its shape by fitting the Mossbauer spectrum in Fig. 3(a) with the constrained version[28] of the model-independent Hess-Rubartsch method.[29] The same values of \delta and the electric quadrupole shift[24]\varepsilon were assumed for the elementary sextets. The best fit (\chi^{2}=0.86) of the Mossbauer spectrum in Fig. 3(a) was obtained with the distribution P(H) shown in Fig. 3(b). The parameters derived from the fit are \delta=0.564(5) mm/s and \varepsilon=-0.018(2) mm/s, and the average value of the hyperfine magnetic field derived from the P(H) distribution \overline{H}=22.4(1) kOe.

Selected ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectra of Ba(Fe_{0.961}Rh_{0.039})_{2}As_{2} measured at 16 temperatures in the temperature range 4.7-54.9 K, at which the magnetic dipole hyperfine interaction is present,[24] are displayed in Fig. 4. Excellent fits of these spectra (\chi^{2}\approx 0.9) were obtained with the Hesse-Rubartsch method for the P(H) distributions shown in Fig. 4. It is interesting to observe that the trimodal distribution P(H) at low temperatures evolves into a bimodal P(H) at higher temperatures. For a completely random doping-induced disorder one would expect a unimodal distribution P(H). The observed trimodality/bimodality of P(H) seems to indicate a not completely random dopant-induced disorder.

The values of \overline{H} obtained from the determined distributions P(H) at all temperatures are shown in Fig. 5. One can observe the expected increase in \overline{H} with decreasing temperature down to T_{c} (inset in Fig. 5) and then its clear reduction below T_{c}. The value of \overline{H} decreases from 23.4(1) kOe at 13.8 K to 22.1(1) kOe at 2.0 K, a 4.2% reduction. The value of \overline{H} at 0 K, which was derived from the extrapolation of the \overline{H} data in Fig. 5, is \overline{H}(0)=22.3(2) kOe. The occurrence of nonzero \overline{H} values at and below T_{c} clearly demonstrates the coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetic order in the Ba(Fe_{0.961}Rh_{0.039})_{2}As_{2} superconductor.

The measured H is, to a first approximation, proportional to \mu_{\rm Fe} through the relation H=a\mu_{\rm Fe}, where the value of the proportionality constant a is compound specific.[24; 30] In converting \overline{H} to \overline{\mu}_{\rm Fe}, we used a=63 kOe/\mu_{B}, which results from H(4.2 K) = 54.7(1) kOe measured[31] for BaFe_{2}As_{2} and \mu_{\rm Fe}(5 K) = 0.87(3)\mu_{B} determined from the neutron diffraction study of BaFe_{2}As_{2}.[32] Thus, \overline{H}(0)=22.3(2) kOe corresponds to \overline{\mu}_{Fe}(0)=0.35(1)\mu_{B}, which is in good agreement with the value \mu_{\rm Fe}(0)=0.37(10)\mu_{B} determined from the neutron diffraction study of Ba(Fe_{0.961}Rh_{0.039})_{2}As_{2}.[22] The observed reduction of \overline{H}, which is equivalent to the reduction of \overline{\mu}_{\rm Fe}, upon cooling through T_{c} (Fig. 5), observed here for the first time using MS, constitutes clear evidence of the competition between superconductivity and the long-range antiferromagnetic order.

The \overline{H} data (Fig. 5) could be fitted to the power law over the limited range of temperatures (34.7 K\leqslant T\leqslant 54.9 K). The fit yielded the the Neel temperature T_{N}=55.5(1) K, which

  is close to the value of 54 K determined from the neutron diffraction study.[22]

Let us now assume that the distribution P(H) resulting in the 2.0 K Mossbauer spectrum shown in Fig. 6(a) is caused by the incommensurate SDW. Assuming a collinear antiferromagnetic structure (the Fe magnetic moments are aligned antiferromagnetically along the orthorhombic a axis)[22] and collinearity of the Fe magnetic moment and H, one can

  describe the amplitude of the SDW (the hyperfine magnetic field H) along the x direction parallel to the wave vector \mathbf{q} as a series of odd harmonics,[13; 20]

\[H(qx)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}h_{2i-1}\sin[(2i-1)qx],\] (2)

where h_{2i-1} is the amplitude of the (2i-1)th harmonic, q is the wave number of the SDW, x is the relative position of the Fe atom along the direction of SDW propagation, and n denotes the maximum number of harmonics; the periodicity of the SDW demands that 0\leqslant qx\leqslant 2\pi. A Mossbauer spectrum is then fitted to a set of six-line Zeeman patterns corresponding to H values calculated from Eq. (2) for discrete qx values in the range (0,2\pi). We assume the same values of \delta and \varepsilon for each Zeeman pattern. The resulting distribution P(H) can then be calculated from the amplitudes h_{2i-1} determined from the fit. The average value of H given by Eq. (2) is obviously 0, and so the root-mean-square value of H can be obtained from the expression H_{\text{rms}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}h_{2i-1}^{2}}.[13] The square of H_{\text{rms}} is proportional to the intensity of a magnetic Bragg peak in neutron diffraction.[13] Hence, H_{\text{rms}} is proportional to the magnetic moment \mu_{\text{Fe}} of the Fe atoms.

An excellent fit (\chi^{2}=0.99) of the Mossbauer spectrum in Fig. 6(a) could be achieved using n=5 harmonics (_vide infra_), with the resulting shape of the SDW shown in Fig. 6(b) and the corresponding distribution P(H) shown in Fig. 6(c). The parameters derived from the fit are \delta=0.569(6) mm/s and \varepsilon=-0.021(3) mm/s, the maximum value of the hyperfine magnetic field H_{\text{max}}=43.1(1) kOe, the average value of the hyperfine magnetic field derived from the P(H) distribution \overline{H}=21.5(1) kOe, and H_{\text{rms}}=24.6(2) kOe.

Very good fits (\chi^{2}\approx 1.1) could be obtained also for the ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectra recorded at other temperatures at which the magnetic dipole hyperfine interaction is present (Fig. 7) using n=5 harmonics, and the resulting shape of the SDW and the distribution P(H) are shown for each of these spectra (Fig. 7). The values of the harmonic amplitudes resulting from the fits of all the spectra are shown in Fig. 8. The amplitude of the first harmonic h_{1} is an order of magnitude higher than the absolute values of the higher harmonic amplitudes. It increases slightly with increasing temperature in the temperature range 2-14 K and then decreases monotonically with increasing temperature. The temperature dependence of the amplitudes of higher harmonics h_{3}, h_{5}, h_{7}, and h_{9} is smaller than that of h_{1}.

The temperature dependence of the three hyperfine magnetic fields H_{\text{max}}, \overline{H}, and H_{\text{rms}} obtained from the fits of all the spectra is shown in Fig. 9. These three fields increase with decreasing temperature down to T_{c} (insets in Fig. 9) and then clearly decrease below T_{c}. The value of H_{\text{rms}} decreases from 25.5(2) kOe at 13.8 K to 24.6(2) kOe at 2.0 K, a 3.5% reduction. The value of H_{\text{rms}} at 0 K, which was derived from the extrapolation of the H_{\text{rms}}(T) data in Fig. 9, is H_{\text{rms}}(0)=24.4(2) kOe, which corresponds to \mu_{Fe}(0)=0.39(2)\mu_{B}. The fit of the H_{\text{rms}}(T) data (Fig. 9) to the power law yields T_{N}=55.4(5) K.

The two analyses presented above of the Mossbauer spectra recorded at temperatures at which the magnetic dipole hyperfine interaction occurs show that the fits of these spectra with the distribution P(H) resulting from the dopant-induced disorder are only marginally better than the fits with the distribution P(H) due to the incommensurate SDW. Thus, one cannot state conclusively that the Mossbauer spectra result from the presence of dopant-induced disorder rather than from the existence of incommensurate SDW. One notes, however, that the relevant physical parameters derived from these two analyses have very much the same values and temperature dependencies. The SDW incommensurability is most directly detected in neutron and x-ray resonant scattering experiments. These experiments clearly demonstrate the existence of commensurate antiferromagnetic order in the Ba(Fe_{1-x}T_{x})_{2}As_{2} (T = Co, Ni, Rh) superconductors.[7; 8; 22] It would thus appear that the analysis of the Mossbauer spectra of Ba(Fe_{0.961}Rh_{0.039})_{2}As_{2} in terms of the P(H) distribution resulting from the dopant-induced disorder is more justified than that in terms of the P(H) distribution due to incommensurate SDW.

  The temperature dependence of \delta(T), determined from the fits of the Mossbauer spectra measured at all temperatures, is shown in Fig. 10. \delta(T) is given by

\[\delta(T)=\delta_{0}+\delta_{\rm SOD}(T),\] (3)

where \delta_{0} is the intrinsic isomer shift and \delta_{\rm SOD}(T) is the second-order Doppler (SOD) shift, which depends on the lattice vibrations of the Fe atoms.[24] In terms of the Debye approximation of the lattice vibrations, \delta_{\rm SOD}(T) is expressed[24] in terms of the Debye temperature \Theta_{D} as

\[\delta_{\rm SOD}(T)=-\frac{9}{2}\frac{k_{B}T}{Mc}\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{D}} \right)^{3}\int_{0}^{\Theta_{D}/T}\frac{x^{3}dx}{e^{x}-1},\] (4)

where M is the mass of the Mossbauer nucleus and c is the speed of light. By fitting the experimental data to Eq. (3), the quantities \delta_{0} and \Theta_{D} were found to be 0.564(1) mm/s and 357(3) K, respectively. The value of \Theta_{D} found here is much larger than the reported \Theta_{D} values of 134(1) K,[31] 186 K,[33] and 250 K[34] for BaFe_{2}As_{2} derived from specific heat measurements. The most probable reason for this discrepancy is that a different weight of phonon frequency distribution is used in determining \Theta_{D} from the specific heat data than from the Mossbauer data.[35]

## IV Conclusions

We report the results of ^{57}Fe MS measurements in the temperature range 2-294 K of the superconducting compound Ba(Fe_{0.964}Rh_{0.039})_{2}As_{2}. It is found that V_{zz} at 294 K is positive and that it increases with decreasing temperature according to a T^{3/2} power-law relation. The unusual shape of the magnetically split Mossbauer spectra at temperatures between 2.0 K and T_{N}=55.5(1) K is interpreted in terms of the distribution of the hyperfine magnetic fields resulting from the dopant-induced disorder. The hyperfine magnetic field is found to reach a maximum at T_{c} and then to decrease upon further cooling down to 2.0 K. This is taken as evidence of competition between and the coexistence of magnetic order and superconductivity. The extrapolated magnetic moment of Fe atoms at 0 K is found to be 0.35(1) \mu_{B}. The Debye temperature of Ba(Fe_{0.964}Rh_{0.039})_{2}As_{2} is determined to be 357(3) K.
