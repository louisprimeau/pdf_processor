###### Abstract

We have investigated the magnetic penetration depth \lambda and the superconducting coherence length \xi in the vortex lattice of the filled skutterudite compound PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} (T_{c}\sim 0.97 K) using transverse-field muon-spin rotation measurements. Zero-field and longitudinal-field studies were also carried out to investigate the time-reversal symmetry of the superconducting state. We found \lambda = 3650(20) A and \xi=345(5) A at 0.05 K and using these values of \lambda and \xi, together with the Sommerfeld constant we have calculated an effective mass of the quasiparticles m^{*}\approx 10m_{r} and superfluid carrier density n_{s}\approx 4\times 10^{27} carriers/m^{3}. The temperature dependence of the vortex state muon-spin relaxation rate \sigma_{s}(T) is consistent with the phenomenological two-fluid model. Further, the zero-field and longitudinal field measurements do not reveal any signature of a spontaneous internal magnetic field below the superconducting transition temperature, indicating the preservation of time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}, unlike the broken time-reversal symmetry of the superconducting state of the heavy-fermion superconductor PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}.

## I Introduction

The filled skutterudite compounds of the type RT_{4}M_{12} (R= rare earth, T= Fe, Ru, and Os, and M= P, Sb, and As), which exhibit the simple body-centered cubic structure (space group Im-3), have recently attracted considerable interest because of the various properties exhibited by many members of this class, such as unconventional superconductivity, metal-insulator transitions, heavy Fermion behavior, quadrupolar ordering and hybridization gap semiconductivity [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. In addition to the interest in their basic condensed matter physics, these compounds are excellent candidates for future solid state thermoelectric device technology.

Among the rare-earth filled skutterudites, the Pr-based compounds PrT_{4}M_{12} are of particular interest as Pr^{3+} ions can have a magnetic or nonmagnetic ground state [6, 7, 8]. The latter can be either a nonmagnetic singlet (\Gamma_{1}) or a nonmagnetic doublet (\Gamma_{3}) with a finite quadrupole moment (we will use the more familiar group theory labels for O_{h} point group symmetry; see Ref. [11] to see how they map onto T_{h} groups). Interestingly, superconductivity has been observed in the La and Pr-based filled skutterudite compounds with the highest T_{c} of 10.3 K for LaRu_{4}As_{12} and 2.4 K for PrRu_{4}As_{12}[9]. Superconductivity is also observed in the ruthenium antimonide skutterudite compounds with T_{c}=2.8 K for LaRu_{4}Sb_{12} and 1 K of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}[3, 10]. It is interesting to note that PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} becomes a superconductor at 1.85 K, which is higher than that of its nonmagnetic analog LaOs_{4}Sb_{12} (T_{c}=0.74 K). This unusual feature has been attributed to the effects of quadrupolar fluctuations on the pairing mechanism in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, It is therefore interesting to see whether or not the microscopic nature of the superconducting state in PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} is similar to that of PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}. The muon-spin rotation (\mu^{+}SR) technique provides sensitive measurements of the microscopic field distribution inside a type-II superconductor,[18, 19] e.g., the magnetic penetration depth \lambda that is one of the fundamental length scales of superconductors. It can be further used to determine the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. Although the penetration depth of Pr(Os_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{4}Sb_{12} (x=0-1) was previously measured through tunnel diode oscillator measurements, this is a less accurate method to estimate reliable absolute values of the penetration depth because of the limitations of the technique.[20, 21] In this paper, we have therefore carried out \muSR measurements on PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} in zero-field (ZF), longitudinal-field (LF), and transverse-field (TF) configurations to characterize the properties of the superconducting state of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}.

## II Experiments

Our polycrystalline sample of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} was prepared by the flux growth technique at the University of Tokyo as described in Ref. 3. The phase purity of the sample was checked by powder neutron diffraction measurements using the high resolution powder diffractometer (HRPD) at the ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Facility, UK. The positive muon spin-relaxation (\mu^{+}SR) measurements were performed using the MUSR spectrometer at ISIS. We have carried out ZF, LF, and TF \muSR measurements at temperatures ranging from 30 mK to 1.5 K. The sample was fixed to a silver backing plate and mounted onto the cold finger of a dilution refrigerator. The silver sample holder was used because it gives a nonrelaxing muon signal and hence only contributes a temperature independent constant background. In the TF measurements, the field was applied at 1.5 K and then the sample was cooled down to 0.05 K at constant applied magnetic field to avoid any effect due to flux trapping. To analyze the TF data we have projected all the data from 32 detectors onto two histograms with orthogonal phases of 0 and \pi/2, using the method outlined in Ref. 22. We refer to these histograms as the "real" and "imaginary" components of the signal.

## III Results and Discussion

### Neutron diffraction

Rietveld analysis of our neutron-diffraction data using GSAS confirmed that PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} crystallises in the _Im_-3 space group and that the sample was nearly single-phase with \sim6.7 and \sim0.6 % of impurity phases of RuSb_{2} and pure Sb metal, respectively (see Fig. 1), both of which are nonmagnetic. The estimated value of the cubic lattice parameter a=9.27660(1) A and the atomic position parameters of Sb atoms are x_{\rm Sb}=0, y_{\rm sb}=0.15754(7), and z_{\rm sb}=0.34140(6). Occupancy factors and isotropic thermal factors were also refined. The values of the occupancy factors are 1.030(10) for Pr and 0.981(2) for Sb (the occupancy 1.000 for Ru was kept fixed during the Rietveld refinement), which corresponds to essentially full occupancy of all the atomic sites, and the values of isotropic thermal factors (in A^{2}) are 0.0420(16) for Pr, 0.0097(3) for Ru, and 0.0062(6) for Sb. The larger value of the isotropic temperature factor observed for the Pr atom is consistent with the rattling motion expected for the Pr atoms in this structure.

### Muon spin rotation and relaxation

Figure 2 shows the zero-field and longitudinal-field (50 G)\muSR spectra at 0.03 and 1.5 K (i.e., below and above T_{c}) from PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}. The field of 50 G was applied after cooling the sample in ZF to 0.03 K. The most important result is that both the ZF and LF muon depolarization rates show no temperature dependence, indicating that there is no spontaneous internal magnetic field, and confirming that time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the superconducting state of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}. This is in contrast to PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, in which

Three rows of vertical bars correspond to the phases of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} (bottom), RuSb_{2} (middle), and pure Sb-metal (top). The line at the bottom represents the difference curve.

  the ZF \muSR study clearly indicates a spontaneous static internal magnetic field below T_{c}, which has been interpreted as broken time-reversal symmetry of the superconducting state.[16] When the time-reversal symmetry is broken, the non-zero magnetic moments of Cooper pairs that align locally are responsible for the spontaneous, but extremely small, internal magnetic field below T_{c}.[16] Further, we also measured \muSR spectra of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} in a 50 G field cooled (FC) state. These results are indistinguishable from the zero-field cooled data, indicating that the paramagnetic ground state persists down to 0.03 K.

Our ZF field \muSR spectra were fitted using a product of Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe and Lorentzian components. The former is attributed to muon-spin relaxation due to the randomly oriented local fields caused by nuclear moments and the latter to muon-spin relaxation due to electronic fluctuations. For the 50 G LF data we used only the Lorentzian component. In addition to this, a constant background component A_{\rm bg} was also added to account for muons stopping on the sample holder and for possible impurity contributions. The form of the relaxation function used in our analysis is

\[A_{\rm ZF}(t) = A_{0}\left\{\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{3}\left[1-(\sigma_{\rm KT}t)^{ 2}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_{\rm KT}t)^{2}\right)\right]\right\}\] (1) \[\times\exp(-\,\Lambda t)+A_{\rm bg}.\]

The values of the parameters obtained by simultaneous fitting of the four spectra at 1.5 K {0.03 K} shown in Fig. 2 are Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe relaxation rate \sigma_{\rm KT}=0.245(3) \mus^{-1} {0.256(2)}, electronic damping \Lambda = 0.106(4) \mus^{-1} {0.100(4)} in zero-field, and \Lambda = 0.022(1) \mus^{-1} {0.022(1)} in 50 G longitudinal field. The estimated initial asymmetry is A_{0}\sim 0.232(1) and the constant background A_{\rm bg}=0.020(1). It is interesting to note that the ZF values of \sigma_{\rm KT} and \Lambda estimated for PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} are very similar to those estimated for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} (above T_{c}), \sigma_{\rm KT}=0.19 \mus^{-1} and \Lambda = 0.13 \mus^{-1}.[17] The value of A_{\rm bg} gives a background contribution of 8.62%, which is close to the impurity percentage of 6.7% estimated from our neutron diffraction analysis. It is to be noted that there will be a contribution to the relaxation rate (\Lambda) coming from the dynamic behavior of the Pr 4f electrons. However, this contribution is very small and temperature independent in the temperature range of the investigation, 0.03 and 1.5 K, as the crystal field ground state of the Pr^{3+} ions in PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} as well as in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} is a singlet.[11, 12]

In order to determine the magnetic penetration depth \lambda and the superconducting coherence length \xi we have carried out TF-\muSR measurements at various applied magnetic fields between 0 and 700 G, at 0.05 and 1.5 K. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the TF-\muSR muon-spin precession signals, the real component (the imaginary component has not been shown here), at an applied field of 200 G above and below the superconducting transition temperature of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}. A clear difference in the relaxation rate above and below T_{c} can be seen from the data in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). This is due to the well-known fact that type-II superconductors exhibit a flux-line lattice (FLL) state at an applied field B_{c1}<B<B_{c2} (below T_{c}) leading to spatial inhomogeneity of the magnetic induction. Since the implanted muons experience random precessions over the length scale of the FLL, the observed precession signal is a spatial sum of the internal fields. In a polycrystalline sample the Gaussian field distribution of local fields is to a good approximation[18]

\[\sigma=\gamma_{\mu\lambda}\langle\langle(\Delta B^{2})\rangle,\] (2)

where \langle(\Delta B^{2})\rangle is the average of the second moment of the field distribution (\langle\Delta B^{2}\rangle=\langle[B(r)-B_{0}]^{2}\rangle), with B_{0} the applied

Here we have shown only the real component: (a) in the normal state at 1.5 K and (b) in the superconducting state at 0.05 K. The weakly nonrelaxing signal at longer time seen in (b) is due to muons stopping on the sample holder and nonsuperconducting impurities. The solid line represents the fit (see the text).

  field, and \gamma_{\mu}/(2\,\pi) = 135.53(MHz/_T_) is the gyromagnetic ratio of the muon. To estimate ((\Delta B^{2})) it is a common practice to assume a Gaussian distribution of local fields, where the time dependence of the muon spin polarization is proportional to \exp[-(\sigma_{s}t)^{2}/2], and \sigma_{s} is the muon depolarization rate.[23] In order to check that the internal field distribution in our sample has a Gaussian line shape, we have used the maximum-entropy method to estimate the probability distribution of the internal magnetic field at 1.5 and 0.05 K [Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)].[24] Above T_{c} the line shape is Gaussian (the solid line shows the fitted results) and centered at the applied field, due to the uniform field penetration in the sample. Below T_{c}, two Gaussian components are observed due to the inhomogeneous field distribution in the superconducting FLL state, which has a large second moment (\langle\Delta B^{2}\rangle), and in the nonsuperconducting background part. This increase in (\langle\Delta B^{2}\rangle), in turn, gives rise to the large value of the muon-spin depolarization rate below T_{c} and is related to the magnetic penetration depth. For a triangular lattice[18; 20]

\[\langle(\Delta B^{2})\rangle=\left(0.00371\frac{\phi_{0}^{2}}{\lambda^{4}} \right),\] (3)

where \phi_{0}= 2.07 x 10^{-15} T m^{2} is the flux quantum. As with other phenomenological parameters characterizing a superconducting state, the penetration depth can also be related to quantities at the atomic level. Using London theory[18]

\[\lambda^{2}=\frac{m^{*}c^{2}}{4\,\pi n_{s}e^{2}},\] (4)

where m^{*} is the effective mass and n_{s} is the density of superconducting carriers. Within this simple picture, \lambda is independent of magnetic field.

The analysis of our TF-\muSR data was carried out in the time domain using the following functional form:

\[A_{\rm TF}(t) = A_{0}\exp\left(-\,\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_{s}t)^{2}\right)\exp\left( -\,\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_{n}t)^{2}\right)\] (5) \[\times\exp(-\,\Lambda_{\rm TF}t)\cos(\omega t+\Phi_{1})\] \[+\,A_{\rm bg}\cos(\omega_{\rm bg}t+\Phi_{2}),\]

where the first term is the contribution from the sample and the second term the background contribution. A_{0} and A_{\rm bg} are the initial asymmetries arising from the sample and background, respectively, while \sigma_{n} and \sigma_{s} are the muon-spin relaxation rates in the normal state and superconducting state, respectively. \Lambda_{\rm TF} is the relaxation rate due to electronic moments. \omega and \omega_{\rm bg} are the muon precession frequencies in the sample and background component with phase angle \Phi_{1} and \Phi_{2}, respectively. It is to be noted that the TF-\muSR data of PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} were fitted using only a Gaussian component (i.e., keeping \sigma_{s}=0, and then these values of A_{0}, \sigma_{n}, and \Lambda_{\rm TF} were kept fixed to estimate \sigma_{s} below T_{c}. The field dependence of the muon-spin relaxation rate (\sigma_{s}) obtained at 0.05 K in the FLL state, which is shown in Fig. 4, is nonlinear. A similar field dependence has also been observed in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12},[17] YB_{6},[25] and KOs_{2}O_{6}.[26] It was found that at 1.5 K \sigma_{n}(B) exhibits an almost field independent behavior (these values were kept fixed at 0.05 K), but \Lambda_{\rm TF} increases linearly with the applied magnetic field at a rate \sim2 x 10^{-4}\mus^{-1}/G. At 1.5 K the estimated value of \Lambda_{\rm TF}=0.032(6) at 100 G and 0.121(9) at 600 G. A similar linear increase of \sigma_{n} (with \Lambda_{\rm TF} assumed to be zero) with applied field was also observed for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}.[17]

We recall that the critical fields are directly related to the fundamental superconducting parameters, the penetration depth \lambda and the coherence length \xi, by the following relations:

\[B_{c2}(T)=(\phi_{b}/2\,\pi)1/\xi^{2}(T)\] (6)

and

\[B_{c1}(T)=(\phi_{b}/4\,\pi)1/\lambda^{2}(T)\ln(\kappa),\] (7)

where \kappa=\lambda/\xi. For an applied field B_{\rm app}<B_{c2}/4 where the simple London picture is valid, one can estimate \lambda from Eq. (3). This method has been used for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} (B_{c2} \sim 23 kOe), KOs_{2}O_{6} (B_{c2} \sim 400 kOe), and high-temperature cuprate superconductors (B_{c2} \sim 600 kOe).[17; 18; 26] Since the upper critical field B_{c2}=2 kOe of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} is significantly smaller, we cannot apply the simple London picture and relate the muon depolarization rate to \lambda as given by Eq. (3). It is therefore necessary to use the field dependence of the muon-depolarization rate to determine \lambda using the modified London model[27]

\[\sigma_{s}(B)=\left(\frac{\gamma_{\mu}}{\sqrt{2}}\right)B_{0}\sum_{h,k}\left[ \frac{\exp(-\,\xi^{2}q_{h,k}^{2})}{[1+q_{h,k}^{2}\lambda^{2}/(1-B_{0}/B_{c2}) ^{2}]}\right]^{1/2}\]

with

  \[q_{h,k}\neq 0\,,\] (8)

where B_{0} is an applied magnetic field and q_{h,k} the lattice sum over the FLL. We have fitted the estimated values of \sigma_{s}(B) at 0.05 K to Eq. (8) with \lambda and \xi as free parameters. In our analysis, we have taken the lattice sum q_{h,k} over the hexagonal flux line lattice, which is a reasonable assumption as the measured flux line lattice, using small angle neutron scattering (SANS), in PrOs_{4}Sb_{14} exhibits a distorted hexagonal shape at low temperature.[28] The best fit to the data gave \lambda\!=\!3650(20) A and \xi\!=\!345(5) A for PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} and the quality of the fit can be seen in Fig. 4. For comparison, the simpler picture expressed by Eq. (3), yields a value of \lambda\!=\!3610(16) A at 0.05 K.

It is interesting to compare the present value of \lambda and \xi with the values estimated using other methods and also with those of PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}. For PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}, the reported value of \lambda\!=\!3200 A using the relation \lambda\!=\![\phi_{0}B_{c2}(0)]^{1/2}\!/[\sqrt{24}(\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c})\gamma ^{1/2}] and \xi\!=\!400 A using the relation \xi^{2}\!=\![\phi_{0}/2\pi B_{c2}(0)].[20] The tunnel diode oscillator study gives \lambda\!=\!2900 A,[20] which is smaller than the above values. As mentioned previously, this may be due to the fact that the tunnel diode oscillator value depends on a calibration constant. The value of \lambda and \xi obtained from \muSR measurements is more reliable than that obtained from the bulk measurements, as \muSR is a microscopic probe, which directly probes the flux-line lattice in the superconducting state, whose signal represents a simple average over different regions of the sample. Therefore, the effect of inhomogeneity is less serious in \muSR than in bulk measurements. We therefore believe that the observed differences in the value of \lambda are not due to the sample quality, but most likely due to the accuracy of the methods used for the estimation. Furthermore, one obtains \lambda(0)\!=\!3440 A from \muSR measurements and \xi\!=\!116 A from B_{c2} for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}.[17, 11]

Using our estimated value of \lambda\!\simeq\!(m^{*}/n_{s})^{1/2} and the heat capacity coefficient \lambda\!\simeq\!m^{*}n_{s}^{1/3} from Ref. 3, along with the assumption that roughly all the normal state carriers (n_{e}) contribute to the superconductivity (i.e., n_{s}\!\sim\!n_{e}), we have estimated the values of m^{*}\!\approx\!10m_{e} and n_{s}\!\approx\!4\!\times\!10^{27} carriers/m^{3}. This indicates that PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} is a good metal, in agreement with the observed metallic resistivity behavior.[3] For comparison, the values for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} are m^{*}\!=\!50m_{e} and n_{s}\!=\!10^{28} carriers/m^{3}.[17] The mean free path \lambda estimated from the dHvA study is 1300 A for PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} (Ref. 29) which implies that the sample is in the clean limit, i.e., (l/\xi\!\approx\!3.8\!>\!1, whereas l/\xi\!\approx\!3 for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, which validates the thermodynamic relation used above to estimate the atomic parameters.

We also measured the temperature dependence of the FLL relaxation rate \sigma_{s}(T) of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}. Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of \sigma_{s}(T) in an applied magnetic field of 350 G. We have fitted the \sigma_{s}(T) data to the phenomenological two-fluid model,[30]\sigma_{s}(T)\!=\!\sigma_{s}(0)[1\!-\!(T/T_{c})^{N}], with \sigma_{s}(0), T_{c} and N as variable parameters. The best fit was obtained with T_{c}\!=\!0.973(2) K, \sigma_{s}(0)\!=\!0.452(1)\mus^{-1}, and N\!=\!1.44(1) (solid line in Fig. 5). The estimated value of T_{c} is in agreement with T_{c}\!=\!1.04 K (in zero field) reported in Ref. 3. It is worth pointing out that there is no discrepancy between T_{c} estimated in the present work and in Ref. 3. We determined T_{c} in our sample from the temperature dependence of the penetration depth, which was measured in a field of 350 G. According to Fig. 2 in Ref. 3, this field is sufficient to suppress T_{c} by the required amount. The value of N obtained for PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} is much smaller than N\!=\!4, which is expected for s-wave isotropic gap superconductors (the dotted line in Fig. 5 shows the plot with N\!=\!4), and N\!=\!3.6 observed for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}. A smaller value of N\!=\!2.39 was also observed in KOs_{2}O_{6}, which has T_{c}\!=\!8.91 K.[26] It is to be noted that the muon depolarization rate \sigma_{s} does not depend only on \lambda but also depends on \xi. A low value of \kappa(\lambda/\xi) results in the overlapping of the flux lines in the FLL. This, clearly, leads to a reduced measured value of \sigma_{s}. Therefore the temperature dependence of \sigma_{s} has been modelled using the modified London model [Eq. (8)] with the temperature dependence form of \lambda and \xi predicted on the basis of the two-fluid model. This provides a correction for the overlapping flux lines in the FLL. The data are extremely well described for T\!<\!0.6 K, and the fit is shown by a dashed-dotted line in Fig. 5. However, for T\!>\!0.7 K the modified London model is no longer an adequate description of the flux line lattice, due to a strongly increasing overlap of vortices as we approach T_{c}. We note that in the clean limit the size of the vortex core region increases more rapidly with increasing temperature than in the dirty limit.[18] As PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} is in the clean limit, one would expect strong overlap of the vortices as we approach T_{c} and hence the modified London model is not adequate near T_{c}.

## IV Conclusions

We have carried out \muSR measurements to characterize the microscopic nature of the superconducting state of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}. Our zero-field and longitudinal-field \muSR studies

The solid line represents the fit based on the prediction of the phenomenological two-fluid model with N\!=\!1.44 and the dotted line is for N\!=\!4 as expected for an isotropic gap s-wave BCS superconductor. The dashed-dotted line represents the fit based on the modified London model, Eq. (8) (see the text).

  reveal that the superconducting state preserves time-reversal symmetry in PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}, in contrast to the broken time-reversal symmetry reported for the heavy-fermion superconductor PrO_{4}Sb_{12}. However, it needs to be pointed out that the appearance of a static magnetic field below 2 K in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} (Ref. [16]) could also be due to a rearrangement of the low lying CF levels induced by the implanted positive muon (\mu^{\star}) as observed in the singlet ground state compound PrNi_{8}[31]. In rare-earth systems with a non-magnetic ground state, the exchange interaction (J_{\rm ex}) between f electrons competes with the CF splitting (\Delta_{\rm CF}). If J_{\rm ex}/\Delta_{\rm CF}< 1 the system will remain paramagnetic (Van Vleck paramagnet) but if it is larger than one, the system orders magnetically. PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} is a Van Vleck paramagnet with small value of \Delta_{\rm CF}=0.6 meV and therefore it is quite possible that the implanted \mu^{\star} will lift the degeneracy of the excited triplet and rearrange the low lying CF levels in such way that the ratio J_{\rm ex}/\Delta_{\rm CF} becomes greater than one, creating local magnetic order. In the case of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}, \Delta_{\rm CF} is an order of magnitude larger so the effect of the implanted \mu^{\star} on the CF level scheme will be much weaker.

From the transverse-field \muSR measurements, we estimated the magnetic penetration depth \lambda = 3650(20) A and coherence length \xi = 345(5) A at 0.05 K and derived an effective quasiparticle mass m^{\star} = 10m_{\rm r} and superfluid carrier density n_{s} = 4 \times 10^{27} carriers/m^{3}. The temperature dependence of the vortex state muon-spin relaxation rate, \sigma_{s}(T) is consistent with the phenomenological two-fluid model, although the observed value of the exponent 1.44(1) is markedly smaller than the value of 4 expected for an isotropic gap s-wave superconductor. Furthermore, the observed temperature dependent behavior of \sigma_{s}(T) agrees very well (below 0.6 K) with the modified London model. We have compared the values of \lambda and \xi estimated from the \muSR measurements with that estimated using bulk measurements and also with the value for the heavy-fermion superconductor PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}.

###### Abstract

We have investigated the magnetic penetration depth \lambda and the superconducting coherence length \xi in the vortex lattice of the filled skutterudite compound PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} (T_{c}\sim 0.97 K) using transverse-field muon-spin rotation measurements. Zero-field and longitudinal-field studies were also carried out to investigate the time-reversal symmetry of the superconducting state. We found \lambda = 3650(20) A and \xi=345(5) A at 0.05 K and using these values of \lambda and \xi, together with the Sommerfeld constant we have calculated an effective mass of the quasiparticles m^{*}\approx 10m_{r} and superfluid carrier density n_{s}\approx 4\times 10^{27} carriers/m^{3}. The temperature dependence of the vortex state muon-spin relaxation rate \sigma_{s}(T) is consistent with the phenomenological two-fluid model. Further, the zero-field and longitudinal field measurements do not reveal any signature of a spontaneous internal magnetic field below the superconducting transition temperature, indicating the preservation of time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}, unlike the broken time-reversal symmetry of the superconducting state of the heavy-fermion superconductor PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}.

## I Introduction

The filled skutterudite compounds of the type RT_{4}M_{12} (R= rare earth, T= Fe, Ru, and Os, and M= P, Sb, and As), which exhibit the simple body-centered cubic structure (space group Im-3), have recently attracted considerable interest because of the various properties exhibited by many members of this class, such as unconventional superconductivity, metal-insulator transitions, heavy Fermion behavior, quadrupolar ordering and hybridization gap semiconductivity [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. In addition to the interest in their basic condensed matter physics, these compounds are excellent candidates for future solid state thermoelectric device technology.

Among the rare-earth filled skutterudites, the Pr-based compounds PrT_{4}M_{12} are of particular interest as Pr^{3+} ions can have a magnetic or nonmagnetic ground state [6, 7, 8]. The latter can be either a nonmagnetic singlet (\Gamma_{1}) or a nonmagnetic doublet (\Gamma_{3}) with a finite quadrupole moment (we will use the more familiar group theory labels for O_{h} point group symmetry; see Ref. [11] to see how they map onto T_{h} groups). Interestingly, superconductivity has been observed in the La and Pr-based filled skutterudite compounds with the highest T_{c} of 10.3 K for LaRu_{4}As_{12} and 2.4 K for PrRu_{4}As_{12}[9]. Superconductivity is also observed in the ruthenium antimonide skutterudite compounds with T_{c}=2.8 K for LaRu_{4}Sb_{12} and 1 K of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}[3, 10]. It is interesting to note that PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} becomes a superconductor at 1.85 K, which is higher than that of its nonmagnetic analog LaOs_{4}Sb_{12} (T_{c}=0.74 K). This unusual feature has been attributed to the effects of quadrupolar fluctuations on the pairing mechanism in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, It is therefore interesting to see whether or not the microscopic nature of the superconducting state in PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} is similar to that of PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}. The muon-spin rotation (\mu^{+}SR) technique provides sensitive measurements of the microscopic field distribution inside a type-II superconductor,[18, 19] e.g., the magnetic penetration depth \lambda that is one of the fundamental length scales of superconductors. It can be further used to determine the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. Although the penetration depth of Pr(Os_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{4}Sb_{12} (x=0-1) was previously measured through tunnel diode oscillator measurements, this is a less accurate method to estimate reliable absolute values of the penetration depth because of the limitations of the technique.[20, 21] In this paper, we have therefore carried out \muSR measurements on PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} in zero-field (ZF), longitudinal-field (LF), and transverse-field (TF) configurations to characterize the properties of the superconducting state of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}.

## II Experiments

Our polycrystalline sample of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} was prepared by the flux growth technique at the University of Tokyo as described in Ref. 3. The phase purity of the sample was checked by powder neutron diffraction measurements using the high resolution powder diffractometer (HRPD) at the ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Facility, UK. The positive muon spin-relaxation (\mu^{+}SR) measurements were performed using the MUSR spectrometer at ISIS. We have carried out ZF, LF, and TF \muSR measurements at temperatures ranging from 30 mK to 1.5 K. The sample was fixed to a silver backing plate and mounted onto the cold finger of a dilution refrigerator. The silver sample holder was used because it gives a nonrelaxing muon signal and hence only contributes a temperature independent constant background. In the TF measurements, the field was applied at 1.5 K and then the sample was cooled down to 0.05 K at constant applied magnetic field to avoid any effect due to flux trapping. To analyze the TF data we have projected all the data from 32 detectors onto two histograms with orthogonal phases of 0 and \pi/2, using the method outlined in Ref. 22. We refer to these histograms as the "real" and "imaginary" components of the signal.

## III Results and Discussion

### Neutron diffraction

Rietveld analysis of our neutron-diffraction data using GSAS confirmed that PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} crystallises in the _Im_-3 space group and that the sample was nearly single-phase with \sim6.7 and \sim0.6 % of impurity phases of RuSb_{2} and pure Sb metal, respectively (see Fig. 1), both of which are nonmagnetic. The estimated value of the cubic lattice parameter a=9.27660(1) A and the atomic position parameters of Sb atoms are x_{\rm Sb}=0, y_{\rm sb}=0.15754(7), and z_{\rm sb}=0.34140(6). Occupancy factors and isotropic thermal factors were also refined. The values of the occupancy factors are 1.030(10) for Pr and 0.981(2) for Sb (the occupancy 1.000 for Ru was kept fixed during the Rietveld refinement), which corresponds to essentially full occupancy of all the atomic sites, and the values of isotropic thermal factors (in A^{2}) are 0.0420(16) for Pr, 0.0097(3) for Ru, and 0.0062(6) for Sb. The larger value of the isotropic temperature factor observed for the Pr atom is consistent with the rattling motion expected for the Pr atoms in this structure.

### Muon spin rotation and relaxation

Figure 2 shows the zero-field and longitudinal-field (50 G)\muSR spectra at 0.03 and 1.5 K (i.e., below and above T_{c}) from PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}. The field of 50 G was applied after cooling the sample in ZF to 0.03 K. The most important result is that both the ZF and LF muon depolarization rates show no temperature dependence, indicating that there is no spontaneous internal magnetic field, and confirming that time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the superconducting state of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}. This is in contrast to PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, in which

Three rows of vertical bars correspond to the phases of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} (bottom), RuSb_{2} (middle), and pure Sb-metal (top). The line at the bottom represents the difference curve.

  the ZF \muSR study clearly indicates a spontaneous static internal magnetic field below T_{c}, which has been interpreted as broken time-reversal symmetry of the superconducting state.[16] When the time-reversal symmetry is broken, the non-zero magnetic moments of Cooper pairs that align locally are responsible for the spontaneous, but extremely small, internal magnetic field below T_{c}.[16] Further, we also measured \muSR spectra of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} in a 50 G field cooled (FC) state. These results are indistinguishable from the zero-field cooled data, indicating that the paramagnetic ground state persists down to 0.03 K.

Our ZF field \muSR spectra were fitted using a product of Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe and Lorentzian components. The former is attributed to muon-spin relaxation due to the randomly oriented local fields caused by nuclear moments and the latter to muon-spin relaxation due to electronic fluctuations. For the 50 G LF data we used only the Lorentzian component. In addition to this, a constant background component A_{\rm bg} was also added to account for muons stopping on the sample holder and for possible impurity contributions. The form of the relaxation function used in our analysis is

\[A_{\rm ZF}(t) = A_{0}\left\{\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{3}\left[1-(\sigma_{\rm KT}t)^{ 2}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_{\rm KT}t)^{2}\right)\right]\right\}\] (1) \[\times\exp(-\,\Lambda t)+A_{\rm bg}.\]

The values of the parameters obtained by simultaneous fitting of the four spectra at 1.5 K {0.03 K} shown in Fig. 2 are Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe relaxation rate \sigma_{\rm KT}=0.245(3) \mus^{-1} {0.256(2)}, electronic damping \Lambda = 0.106(4) \mus^{-1} {0.100(4)} in zero-field, and \Lambda = 0.022(1) \mus^{-1} {0.022(1)} in 50 G longitudinal field. The estimated initial asymmetry is A_{0}\sim 0.232(1) and the constant background A_{\rm bg}=0.020(1). It is interesting to note that the ZF values of \sigma_{\rm KT} and \Lambda estimated for PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} are very similar to those estimated for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} (above T_{c}), \sigma_{\rm KT}=0.19 \mus^{-1} and \Lambda = 0.13 \mus^{-1}.[17] The value of A_{\rm bg} gives a background contribution of 8.62%, which is close to the impurity percentage of 6.7% estimated from our neutron diffraction analysis. It is to be noted that there will be a contribution to the relaxation rate (\Lambda) coming from the dynamic behavior of the Pr 4f electrons. However, this contribution is very small and temperature independent in the temperature range of the investigation, 0.03 and 1.5 K, as the crystal field ground state of the Pr^{3+} ions in PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} as well as in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} is a singlet.[11, 12]

In order to determine the magnetic penetration depth \lambda and the superconducting coherence length \xi we have carried out TF-\muSR measurements at various applied magnetic fields between 0 and 700 G, at 0.05 and 1.5 K. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the TF-\muSR muon-spin precession signals, the real component (the imaginary component has not been shown here), at an applied field of 200 G above and below the superconducting transition temperature of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}. A clear difference in the relaxation rate above and below T_{c} can be seen from the data in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). This is due to the well-known fact that type-II superconductors exhibit a flux-line lattice (FLL) state at an applied field B_{c1}<B<B_{c2} (below T_{c}) leading to spatial inhomogeneity of the magnetic induction. Since the implanted muons experience random precessions over the length scale of the FLL, the observed precession signal is a spatial sum of the internal fields. In a polycrystalline sample the Gaussian field distribution of local fields is to a good approximation[18]

\[\sigma=\gamma_{\mu\lambda}\langle\langle(\Delta B^{2})\rangle,\] (2)

where \langle(\Delta B^{2})\rangle is the average of the second moment of the field distribution (\langle\Delta B^{2}\rangle=\langle[B(r)-B_{0}]^{2}\rangle), with B_{0} the applied

Here we have shown only the real component: (a) in the normal state at 1.5 K and (b) in the superconducting state at 0.05 K. The weakly nonrelaxing signal at longer time seen in (b) is due to muons stopping on the sample holder and nonsuperconducting impurities. The solid line represents the fit (see the text). (c),(d) Probability field distribution p(B) of the internal magnetic field obtained using the maximum entropy method in PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} at 1.5 and 0.05 K.

  field, and \gamma_{\mu}/(2\,\pi) = 135.53(MHz/_T_) is the gyromagnetic ratio of the muon. To estimate ((\Delta B^{2})) it is a common practice to assume a Gaussian distribution of local fields, where the time dependence of the muon spin polarization is proportional to \exp[-(\sigma_{s}t)^{2}/2], and \sigma_{s} is the muon depolarization rate.[23] In order to check that the internal field distribution in our sample has a Gaussian line shape, we have used the maximum-entropy method to estimate the probability distribution of the internal magnetic field at 1.5 and 0.05 K [Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)].[24] Above T_{c} the line shape is Gaussian (the solid line shows the fitted results) and centered at the applied field, due to the uniform field penetration in the sample. Below T_{c}, two Gaussian components are observed due to the inhomogeneous field distribution in the superconducting FLL state, which has a large second moment (\langle\Delta B^{2}\rangle), and in the nonsuperconducting background part. This increase in (\langle\Delta B^{2}\rangle), in turn, gives rise to the large value of the muon-spin depolarization rate below T_{c} and is related to the magnetic penetration depth. For a triangular lattice[18; 20]

\[\langle(\Delta B^{2})\rangle=\left(0.00371\frac{\phi_{0}^{2}}{\lambda^{4}} \right),\] (3)

where \phi_{0}= 2.07 x 10^{-15} T m^{2} is the flux quantum. As with other phenomenological parameters characterizing a superconducting state, the penetration depth can also be related to quantities at the atomic level. Using London theory[18]

\[\lambda^{2}=\frac{m^{*}c^{2}}{4\,\pi n_{s}e^{2}},\] (4)

where m^{*} is the effective mass and n_{s} is the density of superconducting carriers. Within this simple picture, \lambda is independent of magnetic field.

The analysis of our TF-\muSR data was carried out in the time domain using the following functional form:

\[A_{\rm TF}(t) = A_{0}\exp\left(-\,\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_{s}t)^{2}\right)\exp\left( -\,\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_{n}t)^{2}\right)\] (5) \[\times\exp(-\,\Lambda_{\rm TF}t)\cos(\omega t+\Phi_{1})\] \[+\,A_{\rm bg}\cos(\omega_{\rm bg}t+\Phi_{2}),\]

where the first term is the contribution from the sample and the second term the background contribution. A_{0} and A_{\rm bg} are the initial asymmetries arising from the sample and background, respectively, while \sigma_{n} and \sigma_{s} are the muon-spin relaxation rates in the normal state and superconducting state, respectively. \Lambda_{\rm TF} is the relaxation rate due to electronic moments. \omega and \omega_{\rm bg} are the muon precession frequencies in the sample and background component with phase angle \Phi_{1} and \Phi_{2}, respectively. It is to be noted that the TF-\muSR data of PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} were fitted using only a Gaussian component (i.e., keeping \sigma_{s}=0, and then these values of A_{0}, \sigma_{n}, and \Lambda_{\rm TF} were kept fixed to estimate \sigma_{s} below T_{c}. The field dependence of the muon-spin relaxation rate (\sigma_{s}) obtained at 0.05 K in the FLL state, which is shown in Fig. 4, is nonlinear. A similar field dependence has also been observed in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12},[17] YB_{6},[25] and KOs_{2}O_{6}.[26] It was found that at 1.5 K \sigma_{n}(B) exhibits an almost field independent behavior (these values were kept fixed at 0.05 K), but \Lambda_{\rm TF} increases linearly with the applied magnetic field at a rate \sim2 x 10^{-4}\mus^{-1}/G. At 1.5 K the estimated value of \Lambda_{\rm TF}=0.032(6) at 100 G and 0.121(9) at 600 G. A similar linear increase of \sigma_{n} (with \Lambda_{\rm TF} assumed to be zero) with applied field was also observed for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}.[17]

We recall that the critical fields are directly related to the fundamental superconducting parameters, the penetration depth \lambda and the coherence length \xi, by the following relations:

\[B_{c2}(T)=(\phi_{b}/2\,\pi)1/\xi^{2}(T)\] (6)

and

\[B_{c1}(T)=(\phi_{b}/4\,\pi)1/\lambda^{2}(T)\ln(\kappa),\] (7)

where \kappa=\lambda/\xi. For an applied field B_{\rm app}<B_{c2}/4 where the simple London picture is valid, one can estimate \lambda from Eq. (3). This method has been used for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} (B_{c2} \sim 23 kOe), KOs_{2}O_{6} (B_{c2} \sim 400 kOe), and high-temperature cuprate superconductors (B_{c2} \sim 600 kOe).[17; 18; 26] Since the upper critical field B_{c2}=2 kOe of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} is significantly smaller, we cannot apply the simple London picture and relate the muon depolarization rate to \lambda as given by Eq. (3). It is therefore necessary to use the field dependence of the muon-depolarization rate to determine \lambda using the modified London model[27]

\[\sigma_{s}(B)=\left(\frac{\gamma_{\mu}}{\sqrt{2}}\right)B_{0}\sum_{h,k}\left[ \frac{\exp(-\,\xi^{2}q_{h,k}^{2})}{[1+q_{h,k}^{2}\lambda^{2}/(1-B_{0}/B_{c2}) ^{2}]}\right]^{1/2}\]

with

  \[q_{h,k}\neq 0\,,\] (8)

where B_{0} is an applied magnetic field and q_{h,k} the lattice sum over the FLL. We have fitted the estimated values of \sigma_{s}(B) at 0.05 K to Eq. (8) with \lambda and \xi as free parameters. In our analysis, we have taken the lattice sum q_{h,k} over the hexagonal flux line lattice, which is a reasonable assumption as the measured flux line lattice, using small angle neutron scattering (SANS), in PrOs_{4}Sb_{14} exhibits a distorted hexagonal shape at low temperature.[28] The best fit to the data gave \lambda\!=\!3650(20) A and \xi\!=\!345(5) A for PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} and the quality of the fit can be seen in Fig. 4. For comparison, the simpler picture expressed by Eq. (3), yields a value of \lambda\!=\!3610(16) A at 0.05 K.

It is interesting to compare the present value of \lambda and \xi with the values estimated using other methods and also with those of PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}. For PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}, the reported value of \lambda\!=\!3200 A using the relation \lambda\!=\![\phi_{0}B_{c2}(0)]^{1/2}\!/[\sqrt{24}(\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c})\gamma ^{1/2}] and \xi\!=\!400 A using the relation \xi^{2}\!=\![\phi_{0}/2\pi B_{c2}(0)].[20] The tunnel diode oscillator study gives \lambda\!=\!2900 A,[20] which is smaller than the above values. As mentioned previously, this may be due to the fact that the tunnel diode oscillator value depends on a calibration constant. The value of \lambda and \xi obtained from \muSR measurements is more reliable than that obtained from the bulk measurements, as \muSR is a microscopic probe, which directly probes the flux-line lattice in the superconducting state, whose signal represents a simple average over different regions of the sample. Therefore, the effect of inhomogeneity is less serious in \muSR than in bulk measurements. We therefore believe that the observed differences in the value of \lambda are not due to the sample quality, but most likely due to the accuracy of the methods used for the estimation. Furthermore, one obtains \lambda(0)\!=\!3440 A from \muSR measurements and \xi\!=\!116 A from B_{c2} for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}.[17, 11]

Using our estimated value of \lambda\!\simeq\!(m^{*}/n_{s})^{1/2} and the heat capacity coefficient \lambda\!\simeq\!m^{*}n_{s}^{1/3} from Ref. 3, along with the assumption that roughly all the normal state carriers (n_{e}) contribute to the superconductivity (i.e., n_{s}\!\sim\!n_{e}), we have estimated the values of m^{*}\!\approx\!10m_{e} and n_{s}\!\approx\!4\!\times\!10^{27} carriers/m^{3}. This indicates that PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} is a good metal, in agreement with the observed metallic resistivity behavior.[3] For comparison, the values for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} are m^{*}\!=\!50m_{e} and n_{s}\!=\!10^{28} carriers/m^{3}.[17] The mean free path \lambda estimated from the dHvA study is 1300 A for PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} (Ref. 29) which implies that the sample is in the clean limit, i.e., (l/\xi\!\approx\!3.8\!>\!1, whereas l/\xi\!\approx\!3 for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, which validates the thermodynamic relation used above to estimate the atomic parameters.

We also measured the temperature dependence of the FLL relaxation rate \sigma_{s}(T) of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}. Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of \sigma_{s}(T) in an applied magnetic field of 350 G. We have fitted the \sigma_{s}(T) data to the phenomenological two-fluid model,[30]\sigma_{s}(T)\!=\!\sigma_{s}(0)[1\!-\!(T/T_{c})^{N}], with \sigma_{s}(0), T_{c} and N as variable parameters. The best fit was obtained with T_{c}\!=\!0.973(2) K, \sigma_{s}(0)\!=\!0.452(1)\mus^{-1}, and N\!=\!1.44(1) (solid line in Fig. 5). The estimated value of T_{c} is in agreement with T_{c}\!=\!1.04 K (in zero field) reported in Ref. 3. It is worth pointing out that there is no discrepancy between T_{c} estimated in the present work and in Ref. 3. We determined T_{c} in our sample from the temperature dependence of the penetration depth, which was measured in a field of 350 G. According to Fig. 2 in Ref. 3, this field is sufficient to suppress T_{c} by the required amount. The value of N obtained for PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} is much smaller than N\!=\!4, which is expected for s-wave isotropic gap superconductors (the dotted line in Fig. 5 shows the plot with N\!=\!4), and N\!=\!3.6 observed for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}. A smaller value of N\!=\!2.39 was also observed in KOs_{2}O_{6}, which has T_{c}\!=\!8.91 K.[26] It is to be noted that the muon depolarization rate \sigma_{s} does not depend only on \lambda but also depends on \xi. A low value of \kappa(\lambda/\xi) results in the overlapping of the flux lines in the FLL. This, clearly, leads to a reduced measured value of \sigma_{s}. Therefore the temperature dependence of \sigma_{s} has been modelled using the modified London model [Eq. (8)] with the temperature dependence form of \lambda and \xi predicted on the basis of the two-fluid model. This provides a correction for the overlapping flux lines in the FLL. The data are extremely well described for T\!<\!0.6 K, and the fit is shown by a dashed-dotted line in Fig. 5. However, for T\!>\!0.7 K the modified London model is no longer an adequate description of the flux line lattice, due to a strongly increasing overlap of vortices as we approach T_{c}. We note that in the clean limit the size of the vortex core region increases more rapidly with increasing temperature than in the dirty limit.[18] As PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} is in the clean limit, one would expect strong overlap of the vortices as we approach T_{c} and hence the modified London model is not adequate near T_{c}.

## IV Conclusions

We have carried out \muSR measurements to characterize the microscopic nature of the superconducting state of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}. Our zero-field and longitudinal-field \muSR studies

Figure 5: (Color online) Temperature dependence of the muon spin relaxation rate associated with the flux line lattice \sigma_{s} in an applied field of 350 G from PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}. The solid line represents the fit based on the prediction of the phenomenological two-fluid model with N\!=\!1.44 and the dotted line is for N\!=\!4 as expected for an isotropic gap s-wave BCS superconductor. The dashed-dotted line represents the fit based on the modified London model, Eq. (8) (see the text).

  reveal that the superconducting state preserves time-reversal symmetry in PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}, in contrast to the broken time-reversal symmetry reported for the heavy-fermion superconductor PrO_{4}Sb_{12}. However, it needs to be pointed out that the appearance of a static magnetic field below 2 K in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} (Ref. [16]) could also be due to a rearrangement of the low lying CF levels induced by the implanted positive muon (\mu^{\star}) as observed in the singlet ground state compound PrNi_{8}[31]. In rare-earth systems with a non-magnetic ground state, the exchange interaction (J_{\rm ex}) between f electrons competes with the CF splitting (\Delta_{\rm CF}). If J_{\rm ex}/\Delta_{\rm CF}< 1 the system will remain paramagnetic (Van Vleck paramagnet) but if it is larger than one, the system orders magnetically. PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} is a Van Vleck paramagnet with small value of \Delta_{\rm CF}=0.6 meV and therefore it is quite possible that the implanted \mu^{\star} will lift the degeneracy of the excited triplet and rearrange the low lying CF levels in such way that the ratio J_{\rm ex}/\Delta_{\rm CF} becomes greater than one, creating local magnetic order. In the case of PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}, \Delta_{\rm CF} is an order of magnitude larger so the effect of the implanted \mu^{\star} on the CF level scheme will be much weaker.

From the transverse-field \muSR measurements, we estimated the magnetic penetration depth \lambda = 3650(20) A and coherence length \xi = 345(5) A at 0.05 K and derived an effective quasiparticle mass m^{\star} = 10m_{\rm r} and superfluid carrier density n_{s} = 4 \times 10^{27} carriers/m^{3}. The temperature dependence of the vortex state muon-spin relaxation rate, \sigma_{s}(T) is consistent with the phenomenological two-fluid model, although the observed value of the exponent 1.44(1) is markedly smaller than the value of 4 expected for an isotropic gap s-wave superconductor. Furthermore, the observed temperature dependent behavior of \sigma_{s}(T) agrees very well (below 0.6 K) with the modified London model. We have compared the values of \lambda and \xi estimated from the \muSR measurements with that estimated using bulk measurements and also with the value for the heavy-fermion superconductor PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}.
