###### Abstract

Na-intercalated FeSe0.5Te0.5 was prepared using the liquid NH3 technique, and a superconducting phase exhibiting a superconducting transition temperature (T_{\rm c}) as high as 27 K was discovered. This can be called the high-T_{\rm c} phase since a 21 K superconducting phase was previously obtained in (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe0.5Te0.5. The chemical composition of the high-T_{\rm c} phase was determined to be (NH3)0.6140Na0.635Fe0.5850.55(3)Te0.442). The x-ray diffraction patterns of both phases show that a larger lattice constant c (i.e., FeSe0.5Te0.5 plane spacing) produces a higher T_{\rm c}. This behavior is the same as that of metal-doped FeSe, suggesting that improved Fermi-surface nesting produces the higher T_{\rm c}. The high-T_{\rm c} phase converted to the low-T_{\rm c} phase within several days, indicating that it is a metastable phase. The temperature dependence of resistance for both phases was recorded at different magnetic fields, and the critical fields were determined for both phases. Finally, the T_{\rm c} versus c phase diagram was prepared for the metal-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5, which is similar to that of metal-doped FeSe, although the T_{\rm c} is lower.

A number of superconductors have been synthesized by doping FeSe solids with metal atoms, establishing that this is a very effective way to realize alternative superconductors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The metal doping has been achieved using a high-temperature annealing technique [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], a liquid solution technique [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], and an electrochemical technique [15]. However, the metal doping of FeSe1-2-Te2(_z_  0) has only been reported in a few studies, in which doping was performed using the annealing and liquid solution techniques [16, 17, 18].

Solid FeSe showed a T_{\rm c} as high as 8 K [19, 20], while the T_{\rm c} value of FeSe1-2-Te2 made a domelike curve when plotted against z. The maximum T_{\rm c} was 14 K for z = 0.5 in FeSe1-2Te2, [21]. Bulk FeTe crystals did not display superconductivity. This phase diagram attracted much attention because of the expectation that a high-T_{\rm c} phase would be produced by the metal doping of FeSe0.5Te0.5. Sakai _et al._ doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 with various metal atoms using the liquid NH3 technique [16], which provided T_{\rm c}'s of 17 K for (NH3)3Ca0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5, 21 K for (NH3)3Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5, and 26 K for (NH3)3Li0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5. Lei _et al._ investigated the z dependence of T_{\rm c} in (NH3)3MFeSe1-2Te2. (0 \leq z\leq 0.8, M; Li and Na), and a T_{\rm c} of 21 K was observed for (NH3)3NaFeSe0.5Te0.5 [18]. They determined the NH3 quantity (_y_) to be 0.3-0.8 using liquid chromatography.

Recently, we discovered multiple superconducting phases in (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe [13], indicating that the Na atom occupies the on-center position (2a site) in the I4/_mmm_ structure (on-center structure) when the x value is small, while the Na atom occupies the off-center position (2b site) in the I4/_mmm_ lattice (off-center structure) when the x value is large. The lattice constant (_c_), is larger in the off-center structure, which provided the high-T_{\rm c} phase.

In this study we discovered a superconducting phase of (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe0.5Te0.5 with a T_{\rm c} as high as 27 K. There are at least two superconducting phases of (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe0.5Te0.5, with T_{\rm c} values as high as 21 and 27 K, a property shared with (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe. The x dependence of T_{\rm c} was investigated in (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe0.5Te0.5, as well as the physical properties and crystal structure of the high-T_{\rm c} phase of (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe0.5Te0.5. The stability of the just-discovered high-T_{\rm c} phase was also checked. The temperature (_T_) dependence of resistance (_R_) was recorded for both phases (T_{\rm c} = 21 K and T_{\rm c} = 27 K) of (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe0.5Te0.5, and the critical magnetic fields (H_{\rm c}) of both phases were determined from their R versus T plots. Based on the T_{\rm c} and c values of (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe0.5Te0.5, the T_{\rm c} versus c phase diagram was obtained, which was similar to that of metal-doped FeSe.

The \beta-FeSe0.5Te0.5 sample was prepared using the same method as that described in Ref. [16]. The samples of (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe0.5Te0.5 were prepared using the liquid NH3 technique [16]; the detailed experimental procedure was described in our previous report [16]. The magnetic susceptibility, _M/H_, of the samples was measured using a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS2); M and H refer to magnetization and applied magnetic field, respectively. The T_{\rm c} and shielding fraction were 14.0 K and 100% at 2 K, respectively, for FeSe0.5Te0.5 (not shown).

The R of the samples was recorded in standard four-terminal measurement mode with a He cryostat regulated by a temperature controller (Oxford Instruments ITC503); the H was applied using an Oxford superconducting magnet system with variable temperature insert; the electric current (_I_) was supplied by a Keithley 220 programmable current source, and the voltage was measured by a Keithley Nanoculmeter 2182. Four conducting wires for the R measurement were attached to each pellet of the high-T_{\rm c} and low-T_{\rm c} phase of (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe0.5Te0.5 using silver paste (see Fig. S1 in the Supplemental Material [22]); the pellet was prepared at room temperature. The x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were measured with a Rigaku R-Axis Rapid-NR x-ray diffractometer with Mo _K\alpha_ source (wavelength \lambda = 0.710 78 A). The chemical composition of each sample was determined by energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy with an EDX spectrometer equipped with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Keyence VE-9800-EDAX Genesis XM2). Throughout this paper, the stoichiometric compositions of the samples prepared are expressed as the experimental nominal values, and the stoichiometric compositions of only two samples were experimentally determined. In this paper, the chemical formula of the samples described without additional comment refers to the experimental nominal values.

The _M_/_H_ versus T plots of (NH3)3Na0.FeSe0.5Te0.5 are shown in Fig. 1(a). The T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} and _T_c values were determined to be 28 and 27 K, respectively. The shielding fraction was 84% at 10 K. The y value of this sample was found to be 0.61(4) from the mass difference before and after reaction with liquid NH3. The T_{\text{c}}(=27 K) of this phase differed from that (_T_c = 21 K) of the low-_T_c phase of (NH3)3NaFeSe0.5Te0.5, which was previously reported [16,17]. Furthermore, the y value (=0.6-0.7) was quite different from the y = 0.03(1) of the low-_T_c phase [17]. In the low-_T_c phase, a significant amount of NH3 may not be included.

The M versus H plot of the high-_T_c phase [(NH3)3Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5] measured at 5 K is shown in Fig. 1(b); the sample used was the same as that used for Fig. 1(a). A diamond-shaped M versus H curve was clearly observed, showing superconductivity. The lower critical field, _H_c1, was determined to be 200 Oe from the expanded M versus H plot shown in the inset of Fig. 1(b), which is higher than that (100 Oe) of the low-_T_c phase [16]. Here, it should be noticed that the M plotted in Fig. 1(b) is smaller by a factor of 5 than that predicted from the _M_/_H_-_T_ plot shown in Fig. 1(a). We do not know why the M becomes smaller than that predicted from Fig. 1(a). After the measurement of the _M_-_H_ curve [Fig. 1(b)], the _M_/_H_-_T_ plot was recorded again, which showed the same _M_/_H_-_T_ plot as that shown in Fig. 1(a), indicating no sample degradation. Anyway, as the _M_-_H_ curve suggests a linear variation of M against H up to 200 Oe, we concluded that 200 Oe is a reasonable value for _H_c1 in the high-_T_c phase.

Figure 1(c) shows the EDX spectrum of the high-_T_c phase of (NH3)3Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5; the same sample was used for Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). The stoichiometric composition of the (NH3)3Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5 sample was experimentally determined to be (NH3)3Na0.63x5Fe0.85e0.55(3)Te0.44(2), in which y = 0.61(4), i.e., (NH3)0.61(4)Na0.63(5)Fe0.85e0.55(3)Te0.44(2), where the Fe count was expressed as 0.85 so that the sum of Se and Te would be equal to 1.0. We confirmed that the y value fell within the range 0.6-0.7, using three different samples (high-_T_c phase).

The XRD pattern of (NH3)3Na0.6FeSe0.5Te0.5 is shown in Fig. 1(d); the sample was not that used for Figs. 1(a)-1(c), but its _T_c was 30 K and the shielding fraction was 89% at 2 K; i.e., it was the high-_T_c phase. The XRD pattern was analyzed by Le Boil fitting considering two phases, the high-_T_c phase and low-_T_c phase, the major phase being the high-_T_c phase. The space group was I4/_mmm_ for both phases. The lattice constants a and c for the high-_T_c phase were determined to be 3.874(2) and 19.33(1) A, respectively. A trace of low-_T_c phase was observed in the XRD pattern, and a and c were 4.029(2) and 16.84(1) A, respectively. However, the c value was significantly different from the _c_[=17.798(7) A] of the low-_T_c phase reported previously [16], indicating that the exact c value could not be determined because so little of the low-_T_c phase was contained in the sample. The a of the low-_T_c phase reported previously was 3.9822(6) A. Reliable values of a and c for the low-_T_c phase are described later.

The high-_T_c and low-_T_c phases of (NH3)3Na FeSe were selectively prepared by varying the concentration of intercalated Na atoms, i.e., the x value [13]. The high-_T_c phase in (NH3)3NaFeSe was obtained with high x values, while the low-_T_c phase was produced in samples with low x values. Figure 2(a) shows the _T_c values of the (NH3)3Na FeSe0.5Te0.5 samples mapped with various experimental nominal x values. Two clearly distinguished _T_c values (_T_c = 28 K and _T_c = 21 K) were recorded for the (NH3)3NaFeSe0.5Te0.5 samples, although some scattering around the above values was observed. However, no clear correlation between _T_c and x was found from the _T_c versus x plot shown in Fig. 2(a). Here, it should be noticed that the x corresponds to the experimental nominal value. Therefore, we may need to consider the difference between nominal and actual x values for understanding why there is no clear correlation [Fig. 2(a)]. From the plot shown in Fig. 2(a), only a presence of two different _T_c's was clearly found in (NH3)3Na9 FeSe0.5Te0.5.

In (a), the _M_/_H_ versus T plots were recorded in 2FC and FC modes, and in the inset of (a), the method of defining _T_c is shown; in the inset of (b), the expanded M versus H plot is shown, and the _H_c1 is obtained. In (c), an EDX peak is assigned to each element, and the red and black characters refer, respectively, to the elements used for the evaluation of chemical composition and those not thus used. In (d), the _×_ (black) and solid (red) curves refer to the experimental XRD and the calculated pattern obtained by Le Boil fitting, respectively. The ticks (pink and purple) refer to the positions of the high-_T_c and low-_T_c phases, respectively. The green and blue curves refer to the background and the difference between the experimental and calculated XRD patterns, respectively.

  Figure 2(b) shows the _M/H_ versus T curves of the typical low-_T_c phase of (NH3)3Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5. The _T_c onset and _T_c values were determined to be 23 and 21.5 K from the _M/H_ versus T curve recorded in zero field cooled (ZFC) mode [Fig. 2(b)]. The shielding fraction was 28% at 10 K for this sample. Figure 2(c) shows the EDX spectrum of the low-_T_c phase, indicating chemical stoichiometry of (NH3)0.0(31)Na0.7(3)Fe1.33Se0.489Te0.5325); the value of Fe was set at 1.33 so that the sum of Se and Te would be 1.0, as was done for the high-_T_c phase. The amount of NH3 (_y_ value) was determined to be 0.03(1) from the mass difference before and after reaction with liquid NH3. Consequently, the amount of NH3 is too small in the low-_T_c phase.

The XRD pattern of the low-_T_c phase, (NH3)3Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5, is shown in Fig. 2(d). The XRD was analyzed by Le Bail fitting considering two phases, the low-_T_c phase and pristine FeSe0.5Te0.5; the space group was I4/_mmm_ for the low-_T_c phase and P4/_mmm_ for pristine FeSe0.5Te0.5. The major phase was the low-_T_c phase, and the a and c were determined to be 3.9824(6) and 17.787(7) A, respectively, which are consistent with the values a = 3.9822(6) A and c = 17.798(7) A reported previously for the low-_T_c phase [16]. The c of the high-_T_c phase is larger by 1.543 A than that of the low-_T_c phase, indicating that a larger c produces a higher _T_c, as also observed in (NH3)_M_x FeSe (_M_: alkali and alkali earth metal atoms) [9,12,13]. The space group is the same in the high-_T_c and low-_T_c phases, indicating that only the location of Na is different in each, as previously discussed for (NH3)3Na.FeSe [13]; we previously suggested that the Na occupies the on-center position in the low-_T_c phase and the off-center position in the high-_T_c phase, under the space group of I4/_mmm_. Therefore, we substantially assume the same scenario for the high-_T_c and low-_T_c phases of (NH3)3Na.FeSe0.5Te0.5. On the other hand, Sedlmaier _et al._ suggested the primitive tetragonal structure (_P_4/_m_ or P4/_mmm_) for NH3-rich _M_x FeSe (_M_: Li, K, and Rb), with more expanded FeSe plane spacing than that in the body-centered tetragonal structure (_I_4/_mmm_) [10]. At the present stage, we cannot conclude whether the high-_T_c phase of (NH3)3Na.FeSe0.5Te0.5 (NH3-rich structure) takes such a primitive tetragonal structure. More detailed analysis using Rietveld refinement is necessary to determine the precise crystal structure.

The _M/H_ versus T plot for (NH3)3Na0.5FeSe0.5Te0.5 (_T_c = 27 K and shielding fraction = 18% at 10 K) is shown in Fig. 3(a), and can be assigned to the high-_T_c phase. However, the _M/H_ versus T plot changed drastically after 3 days, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The _T_c changed to 20 K from 27 K, implying conversion from the high-_T_c to the low-_T_c phase, indicating that the high-_T_c phase is a metastable phase. Such a conversion was frequently observed in this study. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the physical properties of the high-_T_c phase quickly, before the conversion. No conversion was found on a scale of several days in (NH3)3Na.FeSe, although no investigation of conversion was performed for longer time scales, such as a year.

The temperature dependence of R for the high-_T_c and low-_T_c phases at different _H_'s is presented in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. The _T_c onset and _T_c values were determined to be 31 and 27 K, respectively, from the _M/H_ versus T plot for the high-_T_c phase [inset of Fig. 4(a)], while they were 23 and 21 K for the low-_T_c phase [inset of Fig. 4(b)]. As seen from Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), zero R was not observed for either phase because of the use of pellets fabricated from polycrystalline powder samples. No observation of zero R is the same as that in Na- and Ba-doped FeSe prepared using liquid NH3 [7]. As seen from Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), the _T_c onset and _T_c decrease monotonically in both phases with

In (b) the _M/H_ versus T plots were recorded in ZFC and FC modes. In the inset of (b), the method for defining _T_c is shown; the _M/H_ versus T plot was obtained in ZFC mode. In (c), the EDX peak is assigned to each element, and the red and black characters, respectively, refer to the elements used for the evaluation of chemical composition and those not so used. In (d), the × (black) and solid curves (red) refer to the experimental XRD and the calculated pattern obtained by Le Bail fitting, respectively.

  the application of increasing H. In other words, the onset of R drop shifts to a lower temperature, indicating that the R drop can be assigned to a superconducting transition. The H_{\text{c2}} values were evaluated from the T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} at each H. The H_{\text{c}} versus T plots for the high-T_{\text{c}} and low-T_{\text{c}} phases are provided in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d). The H_{\text{c2}} values at 0 K [H_{\text{c2}}(0)] for the high-T_{\text{c}} and low-T_{\text{c}} phases were, respectively, evaluated to be 20 and 34 T with the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg formula, H_{\text{c2}}(0) = -0.693T_{\text{c}} (dH_{\text{c2}}/dT)_{T=T_{\text{c}}}; the values of H_{\text{c1}} were 200 and 100 Oe for high-T_{\text{c}} and low-T_{\text{c}} phases, as described previously. London penetration depth (\lambda) and Ginzburg-Landau coherent length (\xi_{\text{GL}}) are determined to be 1.8\times 10^{2} and 4.1 nm for the high-T_{\text{c}} phase, respectively, and 2.6\times 10^{2} and 3.1 nm for the low-T_{\text{c}} phase, using the formulas H_{\text{c2}} = \frac{\phi_{1}}{2\pi\xi_{\text{GL}}^{2}}, and H_{\text{c1}} = \frac{\phi_{1}}{4\pi\lambda}In\frac{(\lambda}{\xi_{\text{GL}}}), where \Phi_{0}(\approx2.0678 \times 10^{-7} G cm^{2}) is a quantum magnetic flux [23]. The values of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, \kappa, were more than 1/\sqrt{2} for both phases, indicating that these phases are categorized as "type-II superconductor."

Finally, the T_{\text{c}} was plotted as a function of c for (NH_{3})_{y}_{M}FeSe and (NH_{3})_{y}_{M}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} in Fig. 5, where M represents alkali and alkali earth metal atoms, the plots are based on data in this paper and previous articles on various metal-doped FeSe and FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} (Refs. [7,9,12]), and the pressure dependence of T_{\text{c}} in (NH_{3})_{y}_{M}FeSe [24]. Previously, we showed a clear correlation between T_{\text{c}} and c for (NH_{3})_{y}_{M}FeSe, and the saturation of T_{\text{c}} with more expanded FeSe plane spacing [9,12,13]. As seen from Fig. 5, the T_{\text{c}} versus c behavior for (NH_{3})_{y}_{M}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} is similar to that of (NH_{3})_{y}_{M}FeSe, although the T_{\text{c}} of the former is lower than that of the latter. Namely, in (NH_{3})_{y}_{M}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5}, the T_{\text{c}} increases with increasing c, as in (NH_{3})_{M}_{x}FeSe, in which it saturates or decreases at larger c. Here, we did not remark on the difference in carrier concentration between high-T_{\text{c}} and low-T_{\text{c}} phases, because no clear correlation between x and T_{\text{c}} was observed. Furthermore, we found only two superconducting phases even when changing x continuously in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} and (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} [13], suggesting that a different T_{\text{c}} may not originate from the difference in carrier concentration. In other words, the T_{\text{c}} can be substantially scaled with the FeSe or FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} plane spacing. The increase in T_{\text{c}} against c can be simply explained by the improved Fermi-surface nesting allowed by the expanded FeSe or FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} layer spacing (or increase in two dimensionality), while the saturation and decrease in T_{\text{c}} for the more expanded layer spacing implies that the extremely small interaction between layers has a negative effect on superconductivity; i.e., interaction between layers is required for the emergence of superconductivity. These properties of metal-doped FeSe_{1-z}Te_{z} superconductors may open an avenue for the realization of metal-doped Fe chalcogenide materials with higher T_{\text{c}} values.

###### Abstract

Na-intercalated FeSe0.5Te0.5 was prepared using the liquid NH3 technique, and a superconducting phase exhibiting a superconducting transition temperature (T_{\rm c}) as high as 27 K was discovered. This can be called the high-T_{\rm c} phase since a 21 K superconducting phase was previously obtained in (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe0.5Te0.5. The chemical composition of the high-T_{\rm c} phase was determined to be (NH3)0.6140Na0.635Fe0.5850.55(3)Te0.442). The x-ray diffraction patterns of both phases show that a larger lattice constant c (i.e., FeSe0.5Te0.5 plane spacing) produces a higher T_{\rm c}. This behavior is the same as that of metal-doped FeSe, suggesting that improved Fermi-surface nesting produces the higher T_{\rm c}. The high-T_{\rm c} phase converted to the low-T_{\rm c} phase within several days, indicating that it is a metastable phase. The temperature dependence of resistance for both phases was recorded at different magnetic fields, and the critical fields were determined for both phases. Finally, the T_{\rm c} versus c phase diagram was prepared for the metal-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5, which is similar to that of metal-doped FeSe, although the T_{\rm c} is lower.

A number of superconductors have been synthesized by doping FeSe solids with metal atoms, establishing that this is a very effective way to realize alternative superconductors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The metal doping has been achieved using a high-temperature annealing technique [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], a liquid solution technique [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], and an electrochemical technique [15]. However, the metal doping of FeSe1-2-Te2(_z_  0) has only been reported in a few studies, in which doping was performed using the annealing and liquid solution techniques [16, 17, 18].

Solid FeSe showed a T_{\rm c} as high as 8 K [19, 20], while the T_{\rm c} value of FeSe1-2-Te2 made a domelike curve when plotted against z. The maximum T_{\rm c} was 14 K for z = 0.5 in FeSe1-2Te2, [21]. Bulk FeTe crystals did not display superconductivity. This phase diagram attracted much attention because of the expectation that a high-T_{\rm c} phase would be produced by the metal doping of FeSe0.5Te0.5. Sakai _et al._ doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 with various metal atoms using the liquid NH3 technique [16], which provided T_{\rm c}'s of 17 K for (NH3)3Ca0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5, 21 K for (NH3)3Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5, and 26 K for (NH3)3Li0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5. Lei _et al._ investigated the z dependence of T_{\rm c} in (NH3)3MFeSe1-2Te2. (0 \leq z\leq 0.8, M; Li and Na), and a T_{\rm c} of 21 K was observed for (NH3)3NaFeSe0.5Te0.5 [18]. They determined the NH3 quantity (_y_) to be 0.3-0.8 using liquid chromatography.

Recently, we discovered multiple superconducting phases in (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe [13], indicating that the Na atom occupies the on-center position (2a site) in the I4/_mmm_ structure (on-center structure) when the x value is small, while the Na atom occupies the off-center position (2b site) in the I4/_mmm_ lattice (off-center structure) when the x value is large. The lattice constant (_c_), is larger in the off-center structure, which provided the high-T_{\rm c} phase.

In this study we discovered a superconducting phase of (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe0.5Te0.5 with a T_{\rm c} as high as 27 K. There are at least two superconducting phases of (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe0.5Te0.5, with T_{\rm c} values as high as 21 and 27 K, a property shared with (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe. The x dependence of T_{\rm c} was investigated in (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe0.5Te0.5, as well as the physical properties and crystal structure of the high-T_{\rm c} phase of (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe0.5Te0.5. The stability of the just-discovered high-T_{\rm c} phase was also checked. The temperature (_T_) dependence of resistance (_R_) was recorded for both phases (T_{\rm c} = 21 K and T_{\rm c} = 27 K) of (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe0.5Te0.5, and the critical magnetic fields (H_{\rm c}) of both phases were determined from their R versus T plots. Based on the T_{\rm c} and c values of (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe0.5Te0.5, the T_{\rm c} versus c phase diagram was obtained, which was similar to that of metal-doped FeSe.

The \beta-FeSe0.5Te0.5 sample was prepared using the same method as that described in Ref. [16]. The samples of (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe0.5Te0.5 were prepared using the liquid NH3 technique [16]; the detailed experimental procedure was described in our previous report [16]. The magnetic susceptibility, _M/H_, of the samples was measured using a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS2); M and H refer to magnetization and applied magnetic field, respectively. The T_{\rm c} and shielding fraction were 14.0 K and 100% at 2 K, respectively, for FeSe0.5Te0.5 (not shown).

The R of the samples was recorded in standard four-terminal measurement mode with a He cryostat regulated by a temperature controller (Oxford Instruments ITC503); the H was applied using an Oxford superconducting magnet system with variable temperature insert; the electric current (_I_) was supplied by a Keithley 220 programmable current source, and the voltage was measured by a Keithley Nanoculmeter 2182. Four conducting wires for the R measurement were attached to each pellet of the high-T_{\rm c} and low-T_{\rm c} phase of (NH3)3Na_{x}FeSe0.5Te0.5 using silver paste (see Fig. S1 in the Supplemental Material [22]); the pellet was prepared at room temperature. The x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were measured with a Rigaku R-Axis Rapid-NR x-ray diffractometer with Mo _K\alpha_ source (wavelength \lambda = 0.710 78 A). The chemical composition of each sample was determined by energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy with an EDX spectrometer equipped with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Keyence VE-9800-EDAX Genesis XM2). Throughout this paper, the stoichiometric compositions of the samples prepared are expressed as the experimental nominal values, and the stoichiometric compositions of only two samples were experimentally determined. In this paper, the chemical formula of the samples described without additional comment refers to the experimental nominal values.

The _M_/_H_ versus T plots of (NH3)3Na0.FeSe0.5Te0.5 are shown in Fig. 1(a). The T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} and _T_c values were determined to be 28 and 27 K, respectively. The shielding fraction was 84% at 10 K. The y value of this sample was found to be 0.61(4) from the mass difference before and after reaction with liquid NH3. The T_{\text{c}}(=27 K) of this phase differed from that (_T_c = 21 K) of the low-_T_c phase of (NH3)3NaFeSe0.5Te0.5, which was previously reported [16,17]. Furthermore, the y value (=0.6-0.7) was quite different from the y = 0.03(1) of the low-_T_c phase [17]. In the low-_T_c phase, a significant amount of NH3 may not be included.

The M versus H plot of the high-_T_c phase [(NH3)3Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5] measured at 5 K is shown in Fig. 1(b); the sample used was the same as that used for Fig. 1(a). A diamond-shaped M versus H curve was clearly observed, showing superconductivity. The lower critical field, _H_c1, was determined to be 200 Oe from the expanded M versus H plot shown in the inset of Fig. 1(b), which is higher than that (100 Oe) of the low-_T_c phase [16]. Here, it should be noticed that the M plotted in Fig. 1(b) is smaller by a factor of 5 than that predicted from the _M_/_H_-_T_ plot shown in Fig. 1(a). We do not know why the M becomes smaller than that predicted from Fig. 1(a). After the measurement of the _M_-_H_ curve [Fig. 1(b)], the _M_/_H_-_T_ plot was recorded again, which showed the same _M_/_H_-_T_ plot as that shown in Fig. 1(a), indicating no sample degradation. Anyway, as the _M_-_H_ curve suggests a linear variation of M against H up to 200 Oe, we concluded that 200 Oe is a reasonable value for _H_c1 in the high-_T_c phase.

Figure 1(c) shows the EDX spectrum of the high-_T_c phase of (NH3)3Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5; the same sample was used for Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). The stoichiometric composition of the (NH3)3Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5 sample was experimentally determined to be (NH3)3Na0.63x5Fe0.85e0.55(3)Te0.44(2), in which y = 0.61(4), i.e., (NH3)0.61(4)Na0.63(5)Fe0.85e0.55(3)Te0.44(2), where the Fe count was expressed as 0.85 so that the sum of Se and Te would be equal to 1.0. We confirmed that the y value fell within the range 0.6-0.7, using three different samples (high-_T_c phase).

The XRD pattern of (NH3)3Na0.6FeSe0.5Te0.5 is shown in Fig. 1(d); the sample was not that used for Figs. 1(a)-1(c), but its _T_c was 30 K and the shielding fraction was 89% at 2 K; i.e., it was the high-_T_c phase. The XRD pattern was analyzed by Le Boil fitting considering two phases, the high-_T_c phase and low-_T_c phase, the major phase being the high-_T_c phase. The space group was I4/_mmm_ for both phases. The lattice constants a and c for the high-_T_c phase were determined to be 3.874(2) and 19.33(1) A, respectively. A trace of low-_T_c phase was observed in the XRD pattern, and a and c were 4.029(2) and 16.84(1) A, respectively. However, the c value was significantly different from the _c_[=17.798(7) A] of the low-_T_c phase reported previously [16], indicating that the exact c value could not be determined because so little of the low-_T_c phase was contained in the sample. The a of the low-_T_c phase reported previously was 3.9822(6) A. Reliable values of a and c for the low-_T_c phase are described later.

The high-_T_c and low-_T_c phases of (NH3)3Na FeSe were selectively prepared by varying the concentration of intercalated Na atoms, i.e., the x value [13]. The high-_T_c phase in (NH3)3NaFeSe was obtained with high x values, while the low-_T_c phase was produced in samples with low x values. Figure 2(a) shows the _T_c values of the (NH3)3Na FeSe0.5Te0.5 samples mapped with various experimental nominal x values. Two clearly distinguished _T_c values (_T_c = 28 K and _T_c = 21 K) were recorded for the (NH3)3NaFeSe0.5Te0.5 samples, although some scattering around the above values was observed. However, no clear correlation between _T_c and x was found from the _T_c versus x plot shown in Fig. 2(a). Here, it should be noticed that the x corresponds to the experimental nominal value. Therefore, we may need to consider the difference between nominal and actual x values for understanding why there is no clear correlation [Fig. 2(a)]. From the plot shown in Fig. 2(a), only a presence of two different _T_c's was clearly found in (NH3)3Na9 FeSe0.5Te0.5.

In (a), the _M_/_H_ versus T plots were recorded in 2FC and FC modes, and in the inset of (a), the method of defining _T_c is shown; in the inset of (b), the expanded M versus H plot is shown, and the _H_c1 is obtained. In (c), an EDX peak is assigned to each element, and the red and black characters refer, respectively, to the elements used for the evaluation of chemical composition and those not thus used. In (d), the _×_ (black) and solid (red) curves refer to the experimental XRD and the calculated pattern obtained by Le Boil fitting, respectively. The ticks (pink and purple) refer to the positions of the high-_T_c and low-_T_c phases, respectively. The green and blue curves refer to the background and the difference between the experimental and calculated XRD patterns, respectively.

  Figure 2(b) shows the _M/H_ versus T curves of the typical low-_T_c phase of (NH3)3Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5. The _T_c onset and _T_c values were determined to be 23 and 21.5 K from the _M/H_ versus T curve recorded in zero field cooled (ZFC) mode [Fig. 2(b)]. The shielding fraction was 28% at 10 K for this sample. Figure 2(c) shows the EDX spectrum of the low-_T_c phase, indicating chemical stoichiometry of (NH3)0.0(31)Na0.7(3)Fe1.33Se0.489Te0.5325); the value of Fe was set at 1.33 so that the sum of Se and Te would be 1.0, as was done for the high-_T_c phase. The amount of NH3 (_y_ value) was determined to be 0.03(1) from the mass difference before and after reaction with liquid NH3. Consequently, the amount of NH3 is too small in the low-_T_c phase.

The XRD pattern of the low-_T_c phase, (NH3)3Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5, is shown in Fig. 2(d). The XRD was analyzed by Le Bail fitting considering two phases, the low-_T_c phase and pristine FeSe0.5Te0.5; the space group was I4/_mmm_ for the low-_T_c phase and P4/_mmm_ for pristine FeSe0.5Te0.5. The major phase was the low-_T_c phase, and the a and c were determined to be 3.9824(6) and 17.787(7) A, respectively, which are consistent with the values a = 3.9822(6) A and c = 17.798(7) A reported previously for the low-_T_c phase [16]. The c of the high-_T_c phase is larger by 1.543 A than that of the low-_T_c phase, indicating that a larger c produces a higher _T_c, as also observed in (NH3)_M_x FeSe (_M_: alkali and alkali earth metal atoms) [9,12,13]. The space group is the same in the high-_T_c and low-_T_c phases, indicating that only the location of Na is different in each, as previously discussed for (NH3)3Na.FeSe [13]; we previously suggested that the Na occupies the on-center position in the low-_T_c phase and the off-center position in the high-_T_c phase, under the space group of I4/_mmm_. Therefore, we substantially assume the same scenario for the high-_T_c and low-_T_c phases of (NH3)3Na.FeSe0.5Te0.5. On the other hand, Sedlmaier _et al._ suggested the primitive tetragonal structure (_P_4/_m_ or P4/_mmm_) for NH3-rich _M_x FeSe (_M_: Li, K, and Rb), with more expanded FeSe plane spacing than that in the body-centered tetragonal structure (_I_4/_mmm_) [10]. At the present stage, we cannot conclude whether the high-_T_c phase of (NH3)3Na.FeSe0.5Te0.5 (NH3-rich structure) takes such a primitive tetragonal structure. More detailed analysis using Rietveld refinement is necessary to determine the precise crystal structure.

The _M/H_ versus T plot for (NH3)3Na0.5FeSe0.5Te0.5 (_T_c = 27 K and shielding fraction = 18% at 10 K) is shown in Fig. 3(a), and can be assigned to the high-_T_c phase. However, the _M/H_ versus T plot changed drastically after 3 days, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The _T_c changed to 20 K from 27 K, implying conversion from the high-_T_c to the low-_T_c phase, indicating that the high-_T_c phase is a metastable phase. Such a conversion was frequently observed in this study. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the physical properties of the high-_T_c phase quickly, before the conversion. No conversion was found on a scale of several days in (NH3)3Na.FeSe, although no investigation of conversion was performed for longer time scales, such as a year.

The temperature dependence of R for the high-_T_c and low-_T_c phases at different _H_'s is presented in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. The _T_c onset and _T_c values were determined to be 31 and 27 K, respectively, from the _M/H_ versus T plot for the high-_T_c phase [inset of Fig. 4(a)], while they were 23 and 21 K for the low-_T_c phase [inset of Fig. 4(b)]. As seen from Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), zero R was not observed for either phase because of the use of pellets fabricated from polycrystalline powder samples. No observation of zero R is the same as that in Na- and Ba-doped FeSe prepared using liquid NH3 [7]. As seen from Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), the _T_c onset and _T_c decrease monotonically in both phases with

In (b) the _M/H_ versus T plots were recorded in ZFC and FC modes. In the inset of (b), the method for defining _T_c is shown; the _M/H_ versus T plot was obtained in ZFC mode.

In (d), the × (black) and solid curves (red) refer to the experimental XRD and the calculated pattern obtained by Le Bail fitting, respectively.

  the application of increasing H. In other words, the onset of R drop shifts to a lower temperature, indicating that the R drop can be assigned to a superconducting transition. The H_{\text{c2}} values were evaluated from the T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} at each H. The H_{\text{c}} versus T plots for the high-T_{\text{c}} and low-T_{\text{c}} phases are provided in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d). The H_{\text{c2}} values at 0 K [H_{\text{c2}}(0)] for the high-T_{\text{c}} and low-T_{\text{c}} phases were, respectively, evaluated to be 20 and 34 T with the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg formula, H_{\text{c2}}(0) = -0.693T_{\text{c}} (dH_{\text{c2}}/dT)_{T=T_{\text{c}}}; the values of H_{\text{c1}} were 200 and 100 Oe for high-T_{\text{c}} and low-T_{\text{c}} phases, as described previously. London penetration depth (\lambda) and Ginzburg-Landau coherent length (\xi_{\text{GL}}) are determined to be 1.8\times 10^{2} and 4.1 nm for the high-T_{\text{c}} phase, respectively, and 2.6\times 10^{2} and 3.1 nm for the low-T_{\text{c}} phase, using the formulas H_{\text{c2}} = \frac{\phi_{1}}{2\pi\xi_{\text{GL}}^{2}}, and H_{\text{c1}} = \frac{\phi_{1}}{4\pi\lambda}In\frac{(\lambda}{\xi_{\text{GL}}}), where \Phi_{0}(\approx2.0678 \times 10^{-7} G cm^{2}) is a quantum magnetic flux [23]. The values of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, \kappa, were more than 1/\sqrt{2} for both phases, indicating that these phases are categorized as "type-II superconductor."

Finally, the T_{\text{c}} was plotted as a function of c for (NH_{3})_{y}_{M}FeSe and (NH_{3})_{y}_{M}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} in Fig. 5, where M represents alkali and alkali earth metal atoms, the plots are based on data in this paper and previous articles on various metal-doped FeSe and FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} (Refs. [7,9,12]), and the pressure dependence of T_{\text{c}} in (NH_{3})_{y}_{M}FeSe [24]. Previously, we showed a clear correlation between T_{\text{c}} and c for (NH_{3})_{y}_{M}FeSe, and the saturation of T_{\text{c}} with more expanded FeSe plane spacing [9,12,13]. As seen from Fig. 5, the T_{\text{c}} versus c behavior for (NH_{3})_{y}_{M}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} is similar to that of (NH_{3})_{y}_{M}FeSe, although the T_{\text{c}} of the former is lower than that of the latter. Namely, in (NH_{3})_{y}_{M}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5}, the T_{\text{c}} increases with increasing c, as in (NH_{3})_{M}_{x}FeSe, in which it saturates or decreases at larger c. Here, we did not remark on the difference in carrier concentration between high-T_{\text{c}} and low-T_{\text{c}} phases, because no clear correlation between x and T_{\text{c}} was observed. Furthermore, we found only two superconducting phases even when changing x continuously in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} and (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} [13], suggesting that a different T_{\text{c}} may not originate from the difference in carrier concentration. In other words, the T_{\text{c}} can be substantially scaled with the FeSe or FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} plane spacing. The increase in T_{\text{c}} against c can be simply explained by the improved Fermi-surface nesting allowed by the expanded FeSe or FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} layer spacing (or increase in two dimensionality), while the saturation and decrease in T_{\text{c}} for the more expanded layer spacing implies that the extremely small interaction between layers has a negative effect on superconductivity; i.e., interaction between layers is required for the emergence of superconductivity. These properties of metal-doped FeSe_{1-z}Te_{z} superconductors may open an avenue for the realization of metal-doped Fe chalcogenide materials with higher T_{\text{c}} values.
