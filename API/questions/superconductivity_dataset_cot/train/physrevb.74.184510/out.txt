###### Abstract

The hexagonal-layered superconductor \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} (T_{\rm c}=8.5 K) was investigated by neutron diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, and specific-heat measurements. A significant layered character was found in the structure, which comprises edge-sharing \rm{CM}_{06} octahedra sheets and \sim50% carbon occupied blocks. Magnetic characterization revealed the Ginzburg-Landau parameter of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} is \sim26, which is close to that for the comparable T_{\rm c} compound Li_{2}Pd_{3}B (\sim21), but less than a half of that for MgCNi_{3} (\sim54). The molybdenum carbide would provide valuable opportunities to deepen understanding of those unconventional superconductors.

We considered a possibility of local segregation in _e_-Mo_{3}C_{2} due to an inhomogeneity of carbon distribution. We thus tested two hexagonal phases simultaneously, which were assumed to share the same structure basis (_e_-Mo_{3}C_{2}) but have slightly different carbon content and lattice parameters.

In order to test the possibility of the small structure disagreement in a more reliable way, we increased the peak resolution by switching the monochromator from Cu(311) to Ge(311). We succeeded in obtaining a diffraction pattern at a = 2.0787 A for the same sample. Obviously, analysis on this newer pattern was the result of a clear improvement of fitting quality; the best achievement is shown in Fig. 1(b) (_R_wp=6.18%, _R_p=4.78%, and _kh_2=2.099), and the structure solutions are listed in Table 1. The results indicate that the superconducting hexagonal Mo_{3}C_{2} phase is carbon nonstoichiometric, and it is possible to find at least two different carbon compositions (formula sum: Mo_{6}C_{3.564} and Mo_{6}C_{3.926}). Their weight fractions were respectively 0.48 and 0.39, while the remaining 0.13 is due to _a_-Mo_{2}C, which was probably produced by decomposition of _e_-Mo_{3}C_{2} in the quench process, as reported elsewhere.[11]

The schematic structure view is shown in Fig. 2, which is based on the current results. The most remarkable point we found is a layered feature produced by partial carbon occupancy (\sim50%) at the C2 site. The structure of the superconducting _e_-Mo_{3}C_{2} could be characterized as an alternate stacking of the edge-sharing C1-Mo_{6} octahedra sheet (the bottom of Fig. 2) and the nearly 50% carbon occupied C2-Mo_{6} double-layers block (the top of Fig. 2). As the CNi_{6} octahedra network was found crucial to produce the superconductivity in MgCNi_{3},[5] the hexagonal CMo_{6} sheet is expected to play a significant role in the superconductivity in _e_-Mo_{3}C_{2}.

Figure 1: Powder neutron diffraction profiles of the sample at the nominal composition Mo_{3}C_{1.8} taken at _α_ = 1.5403 Å (a) and 2.0787 Å (b). Observed (crosses) and calculated (solid lines) intensities and the difference between those (bottom) are each shown. Vertical small bars indicate calculated reflection positions for _η_-Mo_{3}C_{2} [(a) upper; (b) upper], _α_-Mo_{2}C [(a) lower; (b) center], and another _η_-Mo_{3}C_{2} that has slightly different carbon content and lattice parameters [(b) lower]. The measurements were conducted at room temperature.

  The magnetic characterization of the superconducting transitions is shown in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b). The magnetic onset of the superconductivity ranges from 8.5 K (for the nominal carbon content of 1.9 per the formula mole) to 7.8 K (for the 1.8 per the mole). The superconducting volume fraction of the loose powder sample was \sim100% for the ZFC data and \sim16% for the FC data at 2 K (for Mo_{3}C_{1.8}), confirming that the \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} phase is exactly superconducting at \sim8 K rather than at other phases, such as the impurity \alpha-Mo_{2}C. The carbon content 3.0 was tested under the same synthesis condition and the transition was observed at 8.5 K; however, the superconducting volume fraction was remarkably reduced (<50%, ZFC). The observation indicates that the composition of 3.0 is clearly out of the chemical range of the structure. The small variation of the superconducting transition temperature probably reflects the variable carbon concentration in the \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} structure. Within our study, the highest T_{c} was 8.5 K (magnetic characterization).

Additional magnetic characterization was conducted at 1.8 K. A magnetic hysteresis loop was measured in a field cycle between 55 kOe and -55 kOe. The central part of the M versus H loop was expanded and shown in the main panel of Fig. 3(b). The observed character is a typical of the type-II superconductor, and the lower critical field was estimated \sim130 Oe, as a minimum point of the curve. The magnetic irreversibility field (H_{\rm irr}) was also determined to be \sim40 kOe with a criterion of 1 (10^{-3} emu/g), as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(b).

Temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} (nominal composition Mo_{3}C_{1.8}) between 2 K and 300 K is shown in Fig. 4. The normal-state resistivity is fairly low (\sim0.11 m\Omega cm at room temperature), although it is of the polycrystalline form. However, the ratio (\rho_{300\ \rm K}/\rho_{3\ \rm K}) is poor, indicating a possibility of substantial influence of impurities on the charge transport. Further studies using a single crystal, if it is available, would be significant to verify the possibility. The T_{\rm c} onset is 7.9 K and the transition width (10%/90%) is \sim0.2 K.

The magnetic field-dependent resistivity was measured for the same sample between 2 K and 9 K. The data are shown in the inset of Fig. 4. The superconducting transition temperature goes down with increasing magnitude of the field, being consistent with a conventional superconducting picture.[16] The superconductivity completely disappeared in the field of 90 kOe above 2 K. The upper critical field of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} determined by the electrical measurements is discussed later.

The characterization of the superconducting transition by specific heat measurement is shown in Fig. 5. The main panel shows field dependence of the superconducting transi

  tion in the C_{\rm p}/T versus T^{2} plots. At 70 kOe the superconducting transition is perfectly suppressed and hence the data provide us an extrapolation of the normal-state behavior to the T=0 limit, which corresponds to the Sommerfeld constant (\gamma) of the Fermi-liquid term C(T)/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}, where \beta denotes a lattice contribution coefficient. We obtained \gamma=11.8 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}, which is nearly one-third of the value for MgCNi.[5]

We plotted the same specific-heat data in an alternative form C_{\rm p}/T versus T in the inset of Fig. 5. The plot allows us to determine the midpoint of the thermodynamic transition, as well as the jump \Delta C/T_{\rm c}. The transition midpoint is 7.4 K (for the sample with the nominal composition Mo_{5}C_{1.8}), which is slightly below the resistivity onset. The midpoint for the sample with the nominal composition Mo_{5}C_{1.9} is 8.2 K, giving us clear evidence that the superconducting transition depends on the charge-carrier concentration. A quantitative estimation of the charge carrier is left for future work. We found \Delta C/T_{\rm c} is 17.5 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and 19.8 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} for the C_{1.8} and the C_{1.9} samples, respectively. The values lead the factor \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c} to 1.48 for the C_{1.8} sample, which is nearly identical with the BCS value of 1.43 for a weakly coupled superconductor.[16]

The upper critical field of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} (nominal composition Mo_{3}C_{1.8}) determined by the resistivity and the specific-heat measurements are shown in Fig. 6. A 1% screening was applied to find out the onset of the resistivity transition under the magnetic field (Fig. 4).[17] The resistivity data points are slightly above the specific-heat ones, suggesting a small carbon stoichiometry variation in the sample, in consistent with the results of the neutron diffraction analysis. Hence, we employed the specific-heat data to determine the upper critical field because those seem to reflect an average of the variation.

The upper critical filed at T=0 was estimated by an extrapolation method using a conventional formula H_{\rm C2}(T) =H_{\rm C2}(0)[1-(T/T_{\rm C})^{2}] for a weakly coupled superconductor.[11] A least-squares fit to the data yielded \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0)=5.7(2) T, as shown in Fig. 6. Alternatively, we tested another formula \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}=-0.693(dH_{\rm c2}/dT)_{T\rightarrow\tau}T_{\rm c} developed within the weak-coupling BCS theory by Werthamer _et al.[18]_ As a result, we obtained \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0)=5.6(1) T, which is in a good agreement with the other result. Meanwhile, the Pauli-limiting field was calculated to be 13.9 T in regards to \mu_{0}H_{\rm Pauli}=1.24k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}/\mu_{\rm B}

  where T_{c}=7.4 (the midpoint of the specific-heat jump). The value of \mu_{0}H_{\rm Pauli} is larger than double of \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0), suggesting a pair-breaking effect due to the Zeeman energy is substantial in \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2}.

The evaluation of H_{c2}(0) then allows us to estimate the coherence length \xi at T=0 using the formula \xi(0) = \sqrt{\Phi_{0}/2\pi H_{c2}(0)} (where \Phi_{0} is the flux quantum), being valid for a weakly coupled superconductor.[16] The value \xi(0) = 7.6 nm was obtained. It is approximately 70% longer than that of MgCNi_{3} and \sim20% shorter than that of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B. We discuss the issue later.

The magnetic irreversible feature was studied by a magnetic susceptibility method. Representative susceptibility curves measured in intense magnetic fields are shown in the inset of Fig. 6. The same criterion used in the M versus H study [shown in Fig. 3(b)] was employed and the determinations are plotted in the main panel as crosses. The irreversible area in the superconducting diagram is slightly larger than that for the structurally isotropic compound Li_{2}Pd_{3}B which has nearly the same T_{c},[19, 20, 21, 22] reflecting possible enhancement of vortex liquid or glass states due to the enhanced anisotropic feature of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2}.[23] To deepen understanding of the superconducting dimensionality of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2}, a single-crystal study would play a pivotal role if it is available.

The lower critical field was measured by a magnetic susceptibility method using a conventional formula H_{\rm C1}(T) =H_{\rm C1}(0)[1-(T/T_{\rm C})^{2}] for a weakly coupled superconductor.[16] The original data show a magnetization characteristic in the vicinity of the lower critical field, and it is shown with the main panel of Fig. 7. In our analysis, the minimum point of the data curve was employed as the lower critical field at each temperature, and \mu_{0}H_{\rm C1}(T) was plotted in the small panel of Fig. 7. A least-squares fitting to the points using the formula yielded \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(0)=0.0138(2) T, which is comparable with the values reported for Li_{2}Pd_{3}B (0.0135 T) (Refs. [19, 20, 21, 22]) and MgCNi_{3} (0.01 T).[24, 25, 26] The \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(0) estimation then allows us to evaluate the magnetic penetration depth (\lambda), as the lower critical field is associated with \lambda and \xi through the relation H_{\rm C1}(T) = (\Phi_{0}/4\pi\lambda^{2})ln(\lambda/\xi). The value \lambda(0)=197 nm was obtained.

The Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa(=\lambda/\xi) was then calculated to be 26. It is comparable with that for Li_{2}Pd_{3}B (\sim21),[22] but less than a half of that for MgCNi_{3} (\sim54).[25] The thermodynamical critical field H_{\rm c}(0) was also estimated through the relation H_{\rm C}(0)= \sqrt{H_{\rm c1}(0)H_{\rm c2}(0)}/(\ln\kappa+0.08), which is valid for \kappa\gg[16].[16] The estimation resulted in \mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0)=0.15 T.

## IV Conclusions

In summary, the superconducting parameters of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} were measured and compared with those of the related compounds Li_{2}Pd_{3}B and MgCNi_{3}, which have comparable T_{\rm c} and share the common structure basis, comprising six-hold carbons (borons) by transition metals. The super

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline \multicolumn{5}{c} \\ \multicolumn{1}{c}{Parameters} & Unit & \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} & \mu_{0} & \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0) & \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0) \\ \hline T_{c} & K & 7.4 & 7.5 & 7.6 \\ \mu_{0}H_{C1}(0) & T & 0.014 & 0.014 & 0.010 \\ \mu_{0}H_{C}(0) & T  conducting parameters of those are listed in Table 2. The comparison indicates that the superconducting properties of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} are rather comparable with those of the boride superconductor and are not with the carbon-based one. At this moment, we are unable to explain reasons for the similarities and the differences over these superconducting properties; however, one possibility the present results indicate is that the unusual mechanism of the superconductivity is likely for MgCNi_{3},[5] because the coherence length of MgCNi_{3} is shorter than those of others. The short coherence could be a possible indication of unconventional superconductivity, as intensively discussed in theoretical works.[27, 28, 29, 30] The lager \kappa(0) of MgCNi_{3} than the others also indicates the same possibility.

Although the structure character of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} was found to be rather anisotropic due to the preferred carbon vacancies at the C2 site, we did not see any clear evidence of possible superconducting anisotropy. Perhaps a careful investigation into a single crystal of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} could be a promised way to verify the possibility if it becomes available.

Within our investigation, we were unable to determine whether the mechanism of the superconductivity of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} was understandable within the weak-coupling BCS model. Further evaluations of the superconducting dimensionality, a role of the Mo 4d bands with respect to the 4d magnetism, the mean-free path, and the density of charge carriers responsible for the superconductivity are at least needed to reach a strong conclusion.

###### Abstract

The hexagonal-layered superconductor \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} (T_{\rm c}=8.5 K) was investigated by neutron diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, and specific-heat measurements. A significant layered character was found in the structure, which comprises edge-sharing \rm{CM}_{06} octahedra sheets and \sim50% carbon occupied blocks. Magnetic characterization revealed the Ginzburg-Landau parameter of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} is \sim26, which is close to that for the comparable T_{\rm c} compound Li_{2}Pd_{3}B (\sim21), but less than a half of that for MgCNi_{3} (\sim54). The molybdenum carbide would provide valuable opportunities to deepen understanding of those unconventional superconductors.

We considered a possibility of local segregation in _e_-Mo_{3}C_{2} due to an inhomogeneity of carbon distribution. We thus tested two hexagonal phases simultaneously, which were assumed to share the same structure basis (_e_-Mo_{3}C_{2}) but have slightly different carbon content and lattice parameters.

In order to test the possibility of the small structure disagreement in a more reliable way, we increased the peak resolution by switching the monochromator from Cu(311) to Ge(311). We succeeded in obtaining a diffraction pattern at a = 2.0787 A for the same sample. Obviously, analysis on this newer pattern was the result of a clear improvement of fitting quality; the best achievement is shown in Fig. 1(b) (_R_wp=6.18%, _R_p=4.78%, and _kh_2=2.099), and the structure solutions are listed in Table 1. The results indicate that the superconducting hexagonal Mo_{3}C_{2} phase is carbon nonstoichiometric, and it is possible to find at least two different carbon compositions (formula sum: Mo_{6}C_{3.564} and Mo_{6}C_{3.926}). Their weight fractions were respectively 0.48 and 0.39, while the remaining 0.13 is due to _a_-Mo_{2}C, which was probably produced by decomposition of _e_-Mo_{3}C_{2} in the quench process, as reported elsewhere.[11]

The schematic structure view is shown in Fig. 2, which is based on the current results. The most remarkable point we found is a layered feature produced by partial carbon occupancy (\sim50%) at the C2 site. The structure of the superconducting _e_-Mo_{3}C_{2} could be characterized as an alternate stacking of the edge-sharing C1-Mo_{6} octahedra sheet (the bottom of Fig. 2) and the nearly 50% carbon occupied C2-Mo_{6} double-layers block (the top of Fig. 2). As the CNi_{6} octahedra network was found crucial to produce the superconductivity in MgCNi_{3},[5] the hexagonal CMo_{6} sheet is expected to play a significant role in the superconductivity in _e_-Mo_{3}C_{2}.

Observed (crosses) and calculated (solid lines) intensities and the difference between those (bottom) are each shown. Vertical small bars indicate calculated reflection positions for _η_-Mo_{3}C_{2} [(a) upper; (b) upper], _α_-Mo_{2}C [(a) lower; (b) center], and another _η_-Mo_{3}C_{2} that has slightly different carbon content and lattice parameters [(b) lower]. The measurements were conducted at room temperature.

  The magnetic characterization of the superconducting transitions is shown in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b). The magnetic onset of the superconductivity ranges from 8.5 K (for the nominal carbon content of 1.9 per the formula mole) to 7.8 K (for the 1.8 per the mole). The superconducting volume fraction of the loose powder sample was \sim100% for the ZFC data and \sim16% for the FC data at 2 K (for Mo_{3}C_{1.8}), confirming that the \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} phase is exactly superconducting at \sim8 K rather than at other phases, such as the impurity \alpha-Mo_{2}C. The carbon content 3.0 was tested under the same synthesis condition and the transition was observed at 8.5 K; however, the superconducting volume fraction was remarkably reduced (<50%, ZFC). The observation indicates that the composition of 3.0 is clearly out of the chemical range of the structure. The small variation of the superconducting transition temperature probably reflects the variable carbon concentration in the \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} structure. Within our study, the highest T_{c} was 8.5 K (magnetic characterization).

Additional magnetic characterization was conducted at 1.8 K. A magnetic hysteresis loop was measured in a field cycle between 55 kOe and -55 kOe. The central part of the M versus H loop was expanded and shown in the main panel of Fig. 3(b). The observed character is a typical of the type-II superconductor, and the lower critical field was estimated \sim130 Oe, as a minimum point of the curve. The magnetic irreversibility field (H_{\rm irr}) was also determined to be \sim40 kOe with a criterion of 1 (10^{-3} emu/g), as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(b).

Temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} (nominal composition Mo_{3}C_{1.8}) between 2 K and 300 K is shown in Fig. 4. The normal-state resistivity is fairly low (\sim0.11 m\Omega cm at room temperature), although it is of the polycrystalline form. However, the ratio (\rho_{300\ \rm K}/\rho_{3\ \rm K}) is poor, indicating a possibility of substantial influence of impurities on the charge transport. Further studies using a single crystal, if it is available, would be significant to verify the possibility. The T_{\rm c} onset is 7.9 K and the transition width (10%/90%) is \sim0.2 K.

The magnetic field-dependent resistivity was measured for the same sample between 2 K and 9 K. The data are shown in the inset of Fig. 4. The superconducting transition temperature goes down with increasing magnitude of the field, being consistent with a conventional superconducting picture.[16] The superconductivity completely disappeared in the field of 90 kOe above 2 K. The upper critical field of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} determined by the electrical measurements is discussed later.

The characterization of the superconducting transition by specific heat measurement is shown in Fig. 5. The main panel shows field dependence of the superconducting transi

  tion in the C_{\rm p}/T versus T^{2} plots. At 70 kOe the superconducting transition is perfectly suppressed and hence the data provide us an extrapolation of the normal-state behavior to the T=0 limit, which corresponds to the Sommerfeld constant (\gamma) of the Fermi-liquid term C(T)/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}, where \beta denotes a lattice contribution coefficient. We obtained \gamma=11.8 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}, which is nearly one-third of the value for MgCNi.[5]

We plotted the same specific-heat data in an alternative form C_{\rm p}/T versus T in the inset of Fig. 5. The plot allows us to determine the midpoint of the thermodynamic transition, as well as the jump \Delta C/T_{\rm c}. The transition midpoint is 7.4 K (for the sample with the nominal composition Mo_{5}C_{1.8}), which is slightly below the resistivity onset. The midpoint for the sample with the nominal composition Mo_{5}C_{1.9} is 8.2 K, giving us clear evidence that the superconducting transition depends on the charge-carrier concentration. A quantitative estimation of the charge carrier is left for future work. We found \Delta C/T_{\rm c} is 17.5 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and 19.8 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} for the C_{1.8} and the C_{1.9} samples, respectively. The values lead the factor \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c} to 1.48 for the C_{1.8} sample, which is nearly identical with the BCS value of 1.43 for a weakly coupled superconductor.[16]

The upper critical field of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} (nominal composition Mo_{3}C_{1.8}) determined by the resistivity and the specific-heat measurements are shown in Fig. 6. A 1% screening was applied to find out the onset of the resistivity transition under the magnetic field (Fig. 4).[17] The resistivity data points are slightly above the specific-heat ones, suggesting a small carbon stoichiometry variation in the sample, in consistent with the results of the neutron diffraction analysis. Hence, we employed the specific-heat data to determine the upper critical field because those seem to reflect an average of the variation.

The upper critical filed at T=0 was estimated by an extrapolation method using a conventional formula H_{\rm C2}(T) =H_{\rm C2}(0)[1-(T/T_{\rm C})^{2}] for a weakly coupled superconductor.[11] A least-squares fit to the data yielded \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0)=5.7(2) T, as shown in Fig. 6. Alternatively, we tested another formula \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}=-0.693(dH_{\rm c2}/dT)_{T\rightarrow\tau}T_{\rm c} developed within the weak-coupling BCS theory by Werthamer _et al.[18]_ As a result, we obtained \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0)=5.6(1) T, which is in a good agreement with the other result. Meanwhile, the Pauli-limiting field was calculated to be 13.9 T in regards to \mu_{0}H_{\rm Pauli}=1.24k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}/\mu_{\rm B}

The irreversibility points found out in the way are plotted in the main panel as fine crosses. The fat cross indicated the point determined by the magnetization study at 1.8 K [Fig. 3(b)]. The fat dotted line is a guide to eyes. Pauli’s limit is indicated by an arrow.

  where T_{c}=7.4 (the midpoint of the specific-heat jump). The value of \mu_{0}H_{\rm Pauli} is larger than double of \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0), suggesting a pair-breaking effect due to the Zeeman energy is substantial in \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2}.

The evaluation of H_{c2}(0) then allows us to estimate the coherence length \xi at T=0 using the formula \xi(0) = \sqrt{\Phi_{0}/2\pi H_{c2}(0)} (where \Phi_{0} is the flux quantum), being valid for a weakly coupled superconductor.[16] The value \xi(0) = 7.6 nm was obtained. It is approximately 70% longer than that of MgCNi_{3} and \sim20% shorter than that of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B. We discuss the issue later.

The magnetic irreversible feature was studied by a magnetic susceptibility method. Representative susceptibility curves measured in intense magnetic fields are shown in the inset of Fig. 6. The same criterion used in the M versus H study [shown in Fig. 3(b)] was employed and the determinations are plotted in the main panel as crosses. The irreversible area in the superconducting diagram is slightly larger than that for the structurally isotropic compound Li_{2}Pd_{3}B which has nearly the same T_{c},[19, 20, 21, 22] reflecting possible enhancement of vortex liquid or glass states due to the enhanced anisotropic feature of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2}.[23] To deepen understanding of the superconducting dimensionality of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2}, a single-crystal study would play a pivotal role if it is available.

The lower critical field was measured by a magnetic susceptibility method using a conventional formula H_{\rm C1}(T) =H_{\rm C1}(0)[1-(T/T_{\rm C})^{2}] for a weakly coupled superconductor.[16] The original data show a magnetization characteristic in the vicinity of the lower critical field, and it is shown with the main panel of Fig. 7. In our analysis, the minimum point of the data curve was employed as the lower critical field at each temperature, and \mu_{0}H_{\rm C1}(T) was plotted in the small panel of Fig. 7. A least-squares fitting to the points using the formula yielded \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(0)=0.0138(2) T, which is comparable with the values reported for Li_{2}Pd_{3}B (0.0135 T) (Refs. [19, 20, 21, 22]) and MgCNi_{3} (0.01 T).[24, 25, 26] The \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(0) estimation then allows us to evaluate the magnetic penetration depth (\lambda), as the lower critical field is associated with \lambda and \xi through the relation H_{\rm C1}(T) = (\Phi_{0}/4\pi\lambda^{2})ln(\lambda/\xi). The value \lambda(0)=197 nm was obtained.

The Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa(=\lambda/\xi) was then calculated to be 26. It is comparable with that for Li_{2}Pd_{3}B (\sim21),[22] but less than a half of that for MgCNi_{3} (\sim54).[25] The thermodynamical critical field H_{\rm c}(0) was also estimated through the relation H_{\rm C}(0)= \sqrt{H_{\rm c1}(0)H_{\rm c2}(0)}/(\ln\kappa+0.08), which is valid for \kappa\gg[16].[16] The estimation resulted in \mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0)=0.15 T.

## IV Conclusions

In summary, the superconducting parameters of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} were measured and compared with those of the related compounds Li_{2}Pd_{3}B and MgCNi_{3}, which have comparable T_{\rm c} and share the common structure basis, comprising six-hold carbons (borons) by transition metals. The super

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline \multicolumn{5}{c} \\ \multicolumn{1}{c}{Parameters} & Unit & \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} & \mu_{0} & \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0) & \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0) \\ \hline T_{c} & K & 7.4 & 7.5 & 7.6 \\ \mu_{0}H_{C1}(0) & T & 0.014 & 0.014 & 0.010 \\ \mu_{0}H_{C}(0) & T  conducting parameters of those are listed in Table 2. The comparison indicates that the superconducting properties of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} are rather comparable with those of the boride superconductor and are not with the carbon-based one. At this moment, we are unable to explain reasons for the similarities and the differences over these superconducting properties; however, one possibility the present results indicate is that the unusual mechanism of the superconductivity is likely for MgCNi_{3},[5] because the coherence length of MgCNi_{3} is shorter than those of others. The short coherence could be a possible indication of unconventional superconductivity, as intensively discussed in theoretical works.[27, 28, 29, 30] The lager \kappa(0) of MgCNi_{3} than the others also indicates the same possibility.

Although the structure character of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} was found to be rather anisotropic due to the preferred carbon vacancies at the C2 site, we did not see any clear evidence of possible superconducting anisotropy. Perhaps a careful investigation into a single crystal of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} could be a promised way to verify the possibility if it becomes available.

Within our investigation, we were unable to determine whether the mechanism of the superconductivity of \eta-Mo_{3}C_{2} was understandable within the weak-coupling BCS model. Further evaluations of the superconducting dimensionality, a role of the Mo 4d bands with respect to the 4d magnetism, the mean-free path, and the density of charge carriers responsible for the superconductivity are at least needed to reach a strong conclusion.
