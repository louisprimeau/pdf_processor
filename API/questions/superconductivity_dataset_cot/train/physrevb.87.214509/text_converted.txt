24 February room temperature by switching off the furnace, shiny
platelike crystals can be easily picked up from the alumina crucible.
The single crystals are stable in air or alcohol for several days.

XRD was performed on a SmartLab-9 diffractometer(Rikagu) from 10^(∘) to
80^(∘) with a scanning rate of 4^(∘) per minute. The actual chemical
composition of the single crystal is determined by energy dispersive
x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mounted on the field emission scanning
electronic microscope (FESEM), Siriron 200. The magnetic susceptibility
was measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) (Quantum
Design). The direct current (dc) resistivity was measured by the
conventional four-probe method using the PPMS-9T (Quantum Design).
Resistivity and specific heat down to 50 mK were measured in a dilution
refrigerator on PPMS.

## III Results

The typical size of as-grown single crystals is about 5 mm × 3 mm × 0.03
mm, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a). Elemental analysis was performed
using EDX. A typical EDX spectrum is shown in Fig. 1(a), and the
obtained atomic ratio of CsFe:As is roughly 20.76: 40.52: 38.71. The
atomic ratio is consistent with the composition CsFe₂As₂ within
instrumental error. Figure 1(b) shows the single crystal XRD pattern for
CsFe₂As₂. Only (00/l) reflections can be recognized, indicating that the
crystal is well orientated along the c axis. The c-axis lattice
parameter was estimated to be c = 15.13 A, consistent with a previous
report on the polycrystalline samples.[15]

Figure 2 shows the in-plane resistivity as a function of the temperature
for a CsFe₂As₂ single crystal. The resistivity exhibits metallic
behavior in the entire temperature range between 1.9 K to 300 K. The
behavior of the resistivity resembles that of the counterpart compound
KFe₂As₂. The resistivity begins to drop rapidly at 1.88 K and reaches
zero at 1.8 K. The superconducting transition temperature T_(c) in the
following text is defined as the temperature when the resistivity
reaches zero. The sharp superconducting transition with a transition
width less than 0.1 K indicates high quality of the crystal. The T_(c)
of CsFe₂As₂ is slightly lower than that reported on the polycrystalline
sample.[15] Residual resistivity ρ₀ = 1.8μΩ is obtained by fitting the
data with the formula ρ = ρ₀ + AT^(1.5).[17] The residual resistivity
ratio (RRR) ρ(300K)/ρ₀ is estimated to be 200, comparable with those of
KFe₂As₂ grown with FeAs flux,[7; 18] but much smaller than those in
crystals of KFe₂As₂ grown with KAs.[12; 16]

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of the in-plane magnetic
susceptibility for a CsFe₂As₂ single crystal under

around the superconducting transition.

H = 1 T in the normal state. The CsFe₂As₂ single crystal shows
paramagnetic behavior from 300 to 2 K. No magnetic anomaly corresponding
to cluster glass as reported in KFe₂As₂ was observed here [19].

In Fig. 4(a), we show the temperature dependence of the specific heat of
CsFe₂As₂ down to 50 mK under zero magnetic field. A pronounced jump due
to the superconducting transition is observed below 1.8 K, consistent
with the resistivity measurement. This indicates the high quality of the
present crystals. The normal-state specific heat can be well fitted by
$C_{\rm normal}(T)=\gamma_{\rm N}T+C_{\rm lattice}(T)$, where
$\gamma_{\rm N}T$ and $C_{\rm lattice}(T)=\beta T^{3}+\eta T^{5}$ are
electron and phonon contributions, respectively [20]. The solid line in
Fig. 4(a) is the best fit to the C_(p)/T above T_(c) (1.9 to 10 K). We
obtained $\gamma_{\rm N}=184.01$ mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻², β = 0.466 mJ mol⁻¹K⁻⁴,
and η = 0.00474 mJ mol⁻¹K⁻⁶. From this value of β and by using the
formula Θ_(D) = [12π⁴k_(B)N_(A)Z/(5β)]^(1/3), where N_(A) is the
Avogadro constant and Z is the total number of atoms in one unit cell,
the Debye temperature (Θ_(D)) is estimated to be 275 K. This value is
comparable to that of KFe₂As₂[21] Ba_(0.68)K_(0.32)Fe₂As₂[23], and
LaFeAsO_(0.9)F_(0.1 − δ)[22]. It should be pointed out that
$\gamma_{\rm N}=184.01$ mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻² is very large. The $\gamma_{\rm N}$
reported on Ba_(0.68)K_(0.32)Fe₂As₂, Ba(Fe_(0.925)Co_(0.075))₂As₂, and
FeTe_(0.57)Se_(0.43) is 50, 23.8, and 26.6 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻², respectively
[23, 24, 25]. The specific heat jump is only about 35

$$\gamma_{N}=\frac{1}{3}\pi^{2}\,k_{B}^{2}\,N(E_{F})(1+\lambda),$$

where $N(E_{\rm F})$ is the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi surface
and λ reflects the coupling strength. The large $\gamma_{\rm N}$
indicates the existence of moderately large electron correlations in
CsFe₂As₂. In Ref. [26], the large $\gamma_{\rm N}$ in KFe₂As₂ is
attributed to proximity to an orbitally selective Mott transition due to
strong Hund correlation. Terashima _et al._ interpreted the large
$\gamma_{\rm N}$ in KFe₂As₂ by considering the very large effective
masses of electrons ranging from 6-18m_(e) (m_(e) the free electron
mass) observed in de Haas-van Alphen measurements [6]. $\gamma_{\rm N}$
of KFe₂As₂ is calculated to be 84 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻² from the effective masses
of electrons obtained by ARPES measurements [27], consistent with the de
Haas-van Alphen and specific heat measurement. ARPES measurements on our
crystal of CsFe₂As₂ also revealed the existence of abnormally large
density of states or effective masses of electrons, which may be useful
to understand the very large $\gamma_{\rm N}$ here [28].

Estimating the value of ΔC_(p)/γ_(N)T_(c) is a traditional method to
estimate the coupling strength of a superconductor, with larger values
implying stronger coupling. ΔC_(p)/γ_(N)T_(c) in CsFe₂As₂ can be
estimated to be about 0.35, and similar values about 0.35 and 0.4 were
reported on KFe₂As₂ with RRR of 67 and 650 [10, 29]. This value is much
smaller than that (=1.43) expected for weak-coupling BCS
superconductors, which could be attributed to weak coupling strength or
a non-BCS superconductivity in CsFe₂As₂. In addition, ΔC_(p)/T_(c) at
T_(c) = 1.8 K is estimated to be about 64 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻². The specific
heat jump was observed to be about 120, 30, and 56 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻² in
Ba_(0.68)K_(0.32)Fe₂As₂, Ba(Fe_(0.925)Co_(0.075))₂As₂, and
FeTe_(0.57)Se_(0.43), which have T_(c) of 14-40 K [23, 24, 25].
Considering the low T_(c) of CsFe₂As₂, the jump is quite large and has a
value about 350 times larger than that calculated from
ΔC_(p)/T_(c) = aT_(c)² (a ∼ 0.056 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻⁴), the scaling behavior
proposed by Bud’ko, Ni, and Canfield (BNC) [30]. In KFe₂As₂,
ΔC_(p)/T_(c) ≈ 67 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻² with T_(c) = 3.4 K [21, 31], which also
lies far above the BNC trend. Since most iron-based superconductors obey
the phenomenological law of BNC, this suggests that the pairing symmetry
in CsFe₂As₂ could be similar to that in KFe₂As₂, but different from that
of other iron-based superconductors.

In Fig. 4(a), a large residual superconducting electronic specific heat
can be observed in the T → 0 limit. $\gamma_{\rm res}$ can be estimated
to be about 108.1 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻² from Fig. 4(a).

Figure 4: (a) Temperature dependence of specific heat divided by
temperature for CsFe₂As₂, C_(p)(T)/T. The blue solid line is the fitting
for the data between 1.9 and 10 K (data below 6 K are shown). The
fitting function is described in the text. (b) Temperature dependence of
the difference in the electronic specific heat between the
superconducting and the normal states. The violet, green, and blue solid
lines represent fits for the experimental data by using single-band
s-wave (α = 1.42), single-band d-wave (α = 1.93), and two-band s-wave α
(α₁ = 1.21, α₂ = 3.33) models, respectively.

Though finite values of $\gamma_{\rm res}$ are a common feature in the
specific measurements of the iron-based superconductors,[23, 24] our
$\gamma_{\rm res}$ is extraordinarily large. Large $\gamma_{\rm res}$
was commonly observed in KFe₂As₂,[10, 31, 32] with one exception that
$\gamma_{\rm res}\simeq 0$ was reported in KFe₂As₂ with RRR = 650.[29]
The large $\gamma_{\rm res}$ observed in KFe₂As₂ was thought to arise
from a nonsuperconducting fraction by some authors.[29, 31, 32] The
magnetic contribution from a cluster glass was also thought to be a
possible reason of such large $\gamma_{\rm res}$ in KFe₂As₂.[13, 33] It
should be noted that CsFe₂As₂ and KFe₂As₂ here have very low residual
resistivity in the T → 0 limit and very high $\gamma_{\rm res}$, while
in other pnictide superconductors, such as Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂,[24]
the residual resistivity in the T → 0 limit is relatively high but very
small $\gamma_{\rm res}$ can be observed. These facts suggest that the
large $\gamma_{\rm res}$ in CsFe₂As₂ (as well as in KFe₂As₂) can not be
simply ascribed to some nonsuperconducting impurity, because the low
residual resistivity in the T → 0 limit and the quite high RRR indicate
a low impurity level. Furthermore, a cluster glass origin can be ruled
out for interpreting the large $\gamma_{\rm res}$ since no feature for
cluster glass can be observed in the magnetic susceptibility in Fig. 3.
Considering the large ratio of $\gamma_{\rm res}$ proportional to γ_(N)
observed in KFe₂As₂ and LaOFeP,[34] which were thought to be nodal
superconductors, the large $\gamma_{\rm res}$ and large
$\gamma_{\rm res}/\gamma_{N}$ ratio observed in CsFe₂As₂ might be a sign
of a nodal superconductor.

Figure 4(b) shows the superconducting electronic specific heat
difference between the superconducting and normal states,
$\Delta C_{p}(T)=C_{\rm p}(T)-C_{\rm normal}(T)=C_{\rm es}-\gamma_{\rm N}T$,
where $C_{\rm es}=C_{\rm p}(T)-C_{\rm lattice}(T)$ is the
superconducting electronic specific heat. The entropy conservation is
confirmed to be satisfied. We tried to fit the data using the "α
model:"[35]

$$\Delta C_{p} = C_{es}/T-\gamma_{0}=\frac{4N_{F}}{k_{B}T^{3}}\int_{0}^{\infty} \int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{e^{k/k_{B}T}}{(1+e^{\xi/k_{B}T})^{2}}$$
$$\times\left[\varepsilon^{2}+\Delta^{2}(\theta,T)-\frac{T}{2}\frac {d\,\Delta^{2}(\theta,T)}{dT}\right]d\theta d\varepsilon-\gamma_{0},$$

where γ₀ is a fitting constant. The fitting results are shown in Fig.
4(b). The best fit by a single-band BCS α model yields the reduced gap
value $\alpha(=\Delta/k_{\rm B}T)=1.42$. It indicates that ΔC_(p)/T can
not be described by a single-band BCS α model. As a consequence, our
results exclude the single-band s-wave pairing symmetry. Then,
single-band d-wave and two-band s-wave models were used, as shown in
Fig. 4(b).[20, 36] The two-band s-wave model seems to give rise to a
better fitting quality, with the two gaps of α₁ = 1.21 and α₂ = 3.33,
which seems consistent with a weakly coupled two-band superconductor
with one gap larger than the BCS gap (α = 1.76) and one smaller.[36] The
fitting in the single-band d-wave model has a subtle weak quality with
α = 1.93. The possibility of d-wave cannot be excluded, according to the
discussions above.

In the low-temperature limit, the s-wave model predicts
$\Delta C/T\propto T^{-5/2}\exp(-\Delta/k_{\rm B}T)$, while in the clean
d-wave model, $C_{\rm es}\sim T^{2}$, which gives ΔC_(p)/T ∝ T, as have
been observed in the organic superconductors κ-(BEDT-TTF)₂Cu[N(CN)₂]Br
and κ-(BEDT-TTF)₂Cu(NCS)₂.[37] The low-temperature part of the specific
heat in Fig. 4(b) roughly follows a linear temperature dependence rather
than an exponential one, therefore, the gap symmetry seems most likely
to be d wave. The thermal conductivity measured on the same batch of
CsFe₂As₂ single crystals indicates nodal superconducting gap
symmetry.[17] It has been reported that there is an anomaly around 0.7 K
in C_(p)/T of KFe₂As₂, which was thought to be related to the impurity
or disordered magnetism contribution in the sample,[19, 29, 33] and
higher quality of crystals can almost eliminate such an anomaly in
KFe₂As₂.[13] But the anomaly was also attributed to small
superconducting gaps on parts of the Fermi surface by some authors.[38]
Such a very weak anomaly may slightly affect the result of the fit. This
may make it a little ambiguous to deduce the pairing symmetry just from
the fittings, since the main difference between the fitting in d-wave
and two-band s-wave models lies below 0.55 K (although the difference is
very weak). Therefore we measured the temperature dependence of specific
heat under different magnetic fields to investigate the field dependence
of the Sommerfeld coefficient γ(H) since the field dependence of γ(H)
can provide information for the superconducting pairing symmetry.

The C_(p)/T taken under various magnetic fields is shown in Fig. 5(a).
With increasing external field, the superconductivity is gradually
suppressed and the electronic contribution is enhanced. T_(c)(H) can be
determined by the midpoint over the superconducting jump in specific
heat. We plotted T_(c)(H) with the magnetic field in Fig. 5(b). The
upper critical field at T = 0 limit $H_{\rm c2}(0)$ can be estimated to
be about 1.65 T, which is nearly the same as that obtained from
transport measurements.[17]

Figure 5: (Color online) (a) Temperature dependence of C_(p)/T under
various magnetic fields. (b) The upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}$
determined by the specific heat shown in (a). The dashed line guides
one’s eye to estimate $H_{\rm c2}(0)$.

We then plotted the C_(p)/T taken under various magnetic fields against
T² in Fig. 6(a), from which we can determine the Sommerfeld coefficient
under different magnetic fields [γ(H)]. For a full gapped
superconductor, the quasiparticle excitations are confined inside the
vortex cores, and as a consequence γ(H) mainly arises from the density
of states of such localized quasiparticles, which would lead to
γ(H) ∝ H.[39] However, as the superconducting gap possesses a deep
minimum or a node, delocalized quasiparticles would exist and they could
lead to a nonlinear magnetic field dependence, such as the relation of
γ(H) ∝ H^(1/2) observed in cuprate supercondutors with d-wave
superconducting pairing symmetry. Theoretically, by using a
Doppler-shift approach, Volovik showed that for superconductors with
line nodes the extended quasiparticle excitations outside the vortex
cores would cause a nonlinear magnetic field dependence of the spatially
averaged residual density of states
$N(\omega=0,H)\propto N_{0}\sqrt{H/H_{c2}}$, a result known as the
Volovik effect.[40] By fitting the lowest-temperature part of C_(p)/T
linear to T², as shown in Fig. 6(a) by the solid lines, γ(H) can be
determined. We plotted $\Delta\gamma(H)=\gamma(H)-\gamma_{\rm res}$
against H in Fig. 6(b). One can find that Δγ(H) is far from the linear
dependence on H. Therefore isotropic s-wave pairing symmetry can be
ruled out. We then plotted Δγ(H) against H^(1/2), as shown in inset of
Fig. 6(b). A linear dependence is observed, that is, Δγ(H) ∝ H^(1/2).
This relation γ(H) ∝ H^(1/2) is similar to the Volovik effect for nodal
superconductors. Although we still cannot definitely determine the
pairing symmetry of CsFe₂As₂, the Volovik-like field dependence of γ(H)
must exclude an isotropic full gap and favor the existence of nodes in
at least some Fermi surfaces; combined with the large ΔC_(p)/T_(c)
versus very low T_(c), the nonexponential dependence of the lowest
temperature ΔC_(p)/T, the fitting of zero-magnetic-field ΔC_(p)/T in
Fig. 4(b), the H^(1/2) dependence of Δγ(H), and the result of thermal
conductivity in our previous paper (where the finite κ₀/T in zero field
and the field dependence of κ₀/T supported a nodal superconducting gap
in CsFe₂As₂), we conclude that d wave might be the most possible
symmetry for the superconducting pairing. Further measurements, such as
ARPES and NMR, should be performed to illustrate the pairing symmetry,
similar to the case of KFe₂As₂.

## IV Summary and conclusions

We have successfully grown CsFe₂As₂ single crystals using the assembly
of a stainless steel container. The sharp drop in resistivity and
pronounced jump in specific heat with T_(c) around 1.8 K indicate the
high quality of crystals. The behavior of resistivity, magnetic
susceptibility, and specific data resemble the counterpart compound
KFe₂As₂. The very large ΔC_(p)/T_(c) at very low T_(c), the
nonexponential dependence of the lowest temperature ΔC_(p)/T, the
fitting results of zero-magnetic-field ΔC_(p)/T in Fig. 4(b), and the
H^(1/2) dependence of Δγ(H) might suggest a pairing symmetry with nodal
gaps in CsFe₂As₂. More work is required to yield the exact pairing
symmetry in this system.
