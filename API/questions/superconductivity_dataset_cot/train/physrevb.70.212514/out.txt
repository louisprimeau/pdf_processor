###### Abstract

The effect of carbon isotope substitution on T_{C} in the intermetallic perovskite superconductor MgCNi_{3} is reported. Four independent groups of samples were synthesized and characterized. The average T_{C} for the ^{12}C samples was found to be 7.12\pm0.02 K and the average T_{C} for the ^{13}C samples was found to be 6.82\pm0.02 K. The resulting carbon isotope effect coefficient is \alpha_{C}=0.540\pm0.03. This indicates that carbon-based phonons play a critical role in the presence of superconductivity in this compound.

## Introduction

MgCNi_{3} has a nonoxygen based perovskite structure and is superconducting near 7 K.[1] MgCNi_{3} and the layered borocarbides (RENi_{2}B_{2}C) (Ref. 2) form a family of Ni-rich intermetallic superconductors in which the Ni d states are found at the Fermi level (E_{F}), and therefore the appearance of superconductivity rather then magnetism is at first unexpected. Considering their structures and the potential magnetism, MgCNi_{3} and the borocarbides appear to be a bridge between conventional, intermetallic superconductors and high-T_{C}. cuprates, and thus questions about the nature of their superconductivity are of interest.

For the case of MgCNi_{3}, conventional phonon-mediated, moderate [1, 3] and strong [4, 5] coupling superconductivity have been proposed from analysis of the specific heat. Strong coupling is also supported by thermopower measurements [6] and the presence of a large energy gap. [4] Further, _s_-wave pairing has been proposed from tunneling spectroscopy, [7] point contact tunneling spectroscopy (Ref. 8), ^{13}C NMR studies, [9] and specific heat measurements. [3] However the closeness of ferromagnetism, [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] a _p_-wave superconducting order parameter and triplet superconductivity have been proposed as possibilities. [15] Finally, evidence for unconventional superconductivity has been provided by penetration depth, [16] tunnelling spectra, [4] and critical current measurements. [17]

The carbon atom occupies a special position in the crystal structure of MgCNi_{3}, in the center of the Ni octahedron. The Ni provides the peak in the density of states at E_{F}. From previous work, it is known that variation of the carbon stoichiometry in MgC_{1-x}Ni_{3} decreases T_{C}, and that for x about 0.2 superconductivity is no longer observed. [5, 18] The important role of carbon for the presence of superconductivity, its position in the crystal structure, and the fact that it is the lowest mass element in the compound, make carbon a good candidate for a possible superconducting isotope effect. In this paper, we report the first study of the carbon isotope effect in MgCNi_{3}. Surprisingly, the isotope effect is found to be substantial, suggesting that C-based phonons play an essential role in the superconducting mechanism.

## Experiment

Four independent groups of 0.2 g samples of Mg^{12}CNi_{3} and Mg^{13}CNi_{3} were synthesized. In each group, one ^{12}C and one ^{13}C sample were made. The starting materials were bright Mg flakes (99% Aldrich Chemical), fine Ni powder (99.9% Johnson Matthey and Alpha Aesar), ^{12}C glassy carbon spherical powder (Alfa Aesar), and amorphous ^{13}C (99% Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.). Previous studies on MgCNi_{3} have indicated the need to employ excess magnesium and carbon in the synthesis in order to obtain optimal carbon content. [1, 5, 18] The excess Mg is mainly vaporized during the course of the reaction, and any excess carbon is present as elemental graphite! in the final product. After thorough mixing, the starting materials were pressed into pellets, wrapped in zirconium foil, placed on an Al_{2}O_{3} boat, and fired in a quartz tube furnace under a 95 % Ar/5 % H_{2} atmosphere. The initial furnace treatment began with one-half hour at 600 ^{\circ}C, followed by 1 h at 900 ^{\circ}C. After cooling, the samples were reground, pressed into pellets, and placed back in the furnace under identical conditions at 900 ^{\circ}C. The latter step was repeated three additional times. Following the final heat treatment, the samples were analyzed with powder x-ray diffraction using CuK_{\alpha} radiation. The superconducting transition temperature was determined by zero field cooling AC magnetization (H_{\rm DC}=5 Oe, H_{\rm AC}=3 Oe, f=10 kHz) from 1.9 K to 8 K (PPMS-Quantum Design).

## Results and Discussion

The crystallographic cell parameter was determined from least-squares fits to nine x-ray reflections between 20 and 90 degrees 2 _th_ for representative ^{12}C and ^{13}C samples. There is no observable isotope mass dependence of the unit cell parameter, _a_=3.8109(6) Aand _a_=3.8116(15) A for Mg^{12}CNi_{3} and Mg^{13}CNi_{3}, respectively. These lattice parameters are in agreement with previously reported values for stoichiometric MgCNi_{3}. [1, 18, 20]

Zero field cooled normalized magnetization data are presented in Fig. 1 for samples containing both ^{12}C and ^{13}C isotopes: data from the Mg^{12}CNi_{3} samples are plotted in the top panel (closed squares) and data from the Mg^{13}CNi_{3} samples are plotted in the bottom panel (closed circles). As can be seen from a cursory inspection of Fig. 1, there is a clear shift of the superconducting critical temperature (T_{C}) to lower temperatures in the ^{13}C samples. The magnetization data in the plot have been normalized to the 4.5 K values to facilitate easy comparison near T_{C}. For a detailed comparison, T_{C} was taken as the temperature where the extrapolation of the steepest slope of the real part of the diamagnetic magnetization versus temperature curves intersects the extrapolation of the normal state magnetization to lower temperatures, removing ambiguities inherent in the use of an "onset" temperature for defining T_{C}. This extrapolation for one representative sample is presented in the bottom panel of Fig. 1.

The T_{C} data are summarized in Table 1. The average shift, \Delta T_{C}= T_{C}(^{12}C) - T_{C}(^{13}C), was calculated to be 300 mK, with the standard deviation value 15 mK. The carbon isotope effect (a_{\rm C}) for each of the four groups was then calculated from the following relation:

\[\alpha_{\rm C}=-\frac{\Delta\ln(T_{C})}{\Delta\ln(M_{C})}=-\frac{\ln\frac{T_{C} \left(^{12}{\rm C}\right)}{T_{C}\left(^{13}{\rm C}\right)}}{\ln\frac{12}{13}},\]

where T_{C} and M_{C} are a critical temperature and a molecular isotope mass ratio, respectively.

The average value of the carbon isotope effect is therefore \alpha_{\rm C}=0.54\pm0.03. Table 1 presents the results for all sample groups.

For a phonon-mediated superconductor, McMillan has shown that T_{C} is proportional to M^{-\alpha} (T_{C}\propto 1/M^{\alpha}), where \alpha is given by [19]

\[\alpha=\frac{1}{2}\Bigg{(}1-\left(\mu*\ \ln\frac{\Theta_{\rm D}}{1.45T_{C}} \right)^{2}\frac{1+0.62\lambda}{1+\lambda}\Bigg{)}.\]

The Debye temperature (\Theta_{\rm D}) values reported for MgCNi_{3} range between 256 and 351 K. [3, 4, 5, 20] The electron-phonon coupling constant (\lambda) has been reported to be in the range from \lambda = 0.77, [1] 0.83 (Ref. [3]) (from specific heat measurements) to \lambda(0) = 1.4 (Ref. [6]) (from thermopower measurements). We take the values \Theta_{\rm D}=256 K and \lambda = 0.77 for our calculations, and note that \alpha is not very sensitive to these parameters. \alpha_{\rm C} is sensitive to the Coulomb coupling constant between electrons (\mu*) however, which has been reported to be in the range 0.10-0.15. [21] This yields an expected \alpha_{\rm C} in the range of 0.4-0.45 from the general characterization of MgCNi_{3}. Our observed value of 0.54\pm0.03 for the isotope effect of carbon is higher than but similar to that value.

## Conclusions

To summarize we have measured the carbon isotope effect in MgCNi_{3}. The obtained value, \alpha_{\rm C}=0.54\pm0.03, is very close to what is expected for a phonon-mediated superconductor. This result indicates that carbon-based phonons play a critical role in the presence of superconductivity in this compound, which shows some unconventional characteristics in its superconducting state.

The carbon isotope effect \alpha_{\rm C}=0.54 is higher but similar to that reported for Rb_{3}C_{60}\alpha_{\rm C}=0.37, [22]^{0.21}, [23] and substantially higher than that for the related borocarbide YNi_{2}B_{2}C, where \alpha_{\rm C} is reported to be very close to zero (\alpha_{\rm C}=0.07). [24] For the borocarbide, however, the boron isotope effect is measured to be \alpha_{\rm B}=0.25 (Ref. [24]) and 0.21 (Ref. [25]) indicating a substantial contribution of boron derived phonons to the superconducting mechanism. The boron isotope effect value in the borocarbide is very close to that in MgB_{2}, reported to be in the range \alpha_{\rm B}=0.28 (Ref. [26]) to \alpha_{\rm B}=0.30 (Ref. [27]). The implication of our measurement is that the vibration of the carbon within the Ni_{6} octahedron strongly modulates the charge in the Ni--Ni near neighbor bonds that dominate the

  density of states at the Fermi energy (E_{F}). If so, then this would be similar to the case in the borocarbide superconductors, where B--C--B phonons have been proposed to strongly influence the charge distribution at E_{F} in states dominated by Ni orbital character.[28]

## Introduction

MgCNi_{3} has a nonoxygen based perovskite structure and is superconducting near 7 K.[1] MgCNi_{3} and the layered borocarbides (RENi_{2}B_{2}C) (Ref. 2) form a family of Ni-rich intermetallic superconductors in which the Ni d states are found at the Fermi level (E_{F}), and therefore the appearance of superconductivity rather then magnetism is at first unexpected. Considering their structures and the potential magnetism, MgCNi_{3} and the borocarbides appear to be a bridge between conventional, intermetallic superconductors and high-T_{C}. cuprates, and thus questions about the nature of their superconductivity are of interest.

For the case of MgCNi_{3}, conventional phonon-mediated, moderate [1, 3] and strong [4, 5] coupling superconductivity have been proposed from analysis of the specific heat. Strong coupling is also supported by thermopower measurements [6] and the presence of a large energy gap. [4] Further, _s_-wave pairing has been proposed from tunneling spectroscopy, [7] point contact tunneling spectroscopy (Ref. 8), ^{13}C NMR studies, [9] and specific heat measurements. [3] However the closeness of ferromagnetism, [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] a _p_-wave superconducting order parameter and triplet superconductivity have been proposed as possibilities. [15] Finally, evidence for unconventional superconductivity has been provided by penetration depth, [16] tunnelling spectra, [4] and critical current measurements. [17]

The carbon atom occupies a special position in the crystal structure of MgCNi_{3}, in the center of the Ni octahedron. The Ni provides the peak in the density of states at E_{F}. From previous work, it is known that variation of the carbon stoichiometry in MgC_{1-x}Ni_{3} decreases T_{C}, and that for x about 0.2 superconductivity is no longer observed. [5, 18] The important role of carbon for the presence of superconductivity, its position in the crystal structure, and the fact that it is the lowest mass element in the compound, make carbon a good candidate for a possible superconducting isotope effect. In this paper, we report the first study of the carbon isotope effect in MgCNi_{3}. Surprisingly, the isotope effect is found to be substantial, suggesting that C-based phonons play an essential role in the superconducting mechanism.

## Experiment

Four independent groups of 0.2 g samples of Mg^{12}CNi_{3} and Mg^{13}CNi_{3} were synthesized. In each group, one ^{12}C and one ^{13}C sample were made. The starting materials were bright Mg flakes (99% Aldrich Chemical), fine Ni powder (99.9% Johnson Matthey and Alpha Aesar), ^{12}C glassy carbon spherical powder (Alfa Aesar), and amorphous ^{13}C (99% Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.). Previous studies on MgCNi_{3} have indicated the need to employ excess magnesium and carbon in the synthesis in order to obtain optimal carbon content. [1, 5, 18] The excess Mg is mainly vaporized during the course of the reaction, and any excess carbon is present as elemental graphite! in the final product. After thorough mixing, the starting materials were pressed into pellets, wrapped in zirconium foil, placed on an Al_{2}O_{3} boat, and fired in a quartz tube furnace under a 95 % Ar/5 % H_{2} atmosphere. The initial furnace treatment began with one-half hour at 600 ^{\circ}C, followed by 1 h at 900 ^{\circ}C. After cooling, the samples were reground, pressed into pellets, and placed back in the furnace under identical conditions at 900 ^{\circ}C. The latter step was repeated three additional times. Following the final heat treatment, the samples were analyzed with powder x-ray diffraction using CuK_{\alpha} radiation. The superconducting transition temperature was determined by zero field cooling AC magnetization (H_{\rm DC}=5 Oe, H_{\rm AC}=3 Oe, f=10 kHz) from 1.9 K to 8 K (PPMS-Quantum Design).

## Results and Discussion

The crystallographic cell parameter was determined from least-squares fits to nine x-ray reflections between 20 and 90 degrees 2 _th_ for representative ^{12}C and ^{13}C samples. There is no observable isotope mass dependence of the unit cell parameter, _a_=3.8109(6) Aand _a_=3.8116(15) A for Mg^{12}CNi_{3} and Mg^{13}CNi_{3}, respectively. These lattice parameters are in agreement with previously reported values for stoichiometric MgCNi_{3}. [1, 18, 20]

Zero field cooled normalized magnetization data are presented in Fig. 1 for samples containing both ^{12}C and ^{13}C isotopes: data from the Mg^{12}CNi_{3} samples are plotted in the top panel (closed squares) and data from the Mg^{13}CNi_{3} samples are plotted in the bottom panel (closed circles). As can be seen from a cursory inspection of Fig. 1, there is a clear shift of the superconducting critical temperature (T_{C}) to lower temperatures in the ^{13}C samples. The magnetization data in the plot have been normalized to the 4.5 K values to facilitate easy comparison near T_{C}. For a detailed comparison, T_{C} was taken as the temperature where the extrapolation of the steepest slope of the real part of the diamagnetic magnetization versus temperature curves intersects the extrapolation of the normal state magnetization to lower temperatures, removing ambiguities inherent in the use of an "onset" temperature for defining T_{C}. This extrapolation for one representative sample is presented in the bottom panel of Fig. 1.

The T_{C} data are summarized in Table 1. The average shift, \Delta T_{C}= T_{C}(^{12}C) - T_{C}(^{13}C), was calculated to be 300 mK, with the standard deviation value 15 mK. The carbon isotope effect (a_{\rm C}) for each of the four groups was then calculated from the following relation:

\[\alpha_{\rm C}=-\frac{\Delta\ln(T_{C})}{\Delta\ln(M_{C})}=-\frac{\ln\frac{T_{C} \left(^{12}{\rm C}\right)}{T_{C}\left(^{13}{\rm C}\right)}}{\ln\frac{12}{13}},\]

where T_{C} and M_{C} are a critical temperature and a molecular isotope mass ratio, respectively.

The average value of the carbon isotope effect is therefore \alpha_{\rm C}=0.54\pm0.03. Table 1 presents the results for all sample groups.

For a phonon-mediated superconductor, McMillan has shown that T_{C} is proportional to M^{-\alpha} (T_{C}\propto 1/M^{\alpha}), where \alpha is given by [19]

\[\alpha=\frac{1}{2}\Bigg{(}1-\left(\mu*\ \ln\frac{\Theta_{\rm D}}{1.45T_{C}} \right)^{2}\frac{1+0.62\lambda}{1+\lambda}\Bigg{)}.\]

The Debye temperature (\Theta_{\rm D}) values reported for MgCNi_{3} range between 256 and 351 K. [3, 4, 5, 20] The electron-phonon coupling constant (\lambda) has been reported to be in the range from \lambda = 0.77, [1] 0.83 (Ref. [3]) (from specific heat measurements) to \lambda(0) = 1.4 (Ref. [6]) (from thermopower measurements). We take the values \Theta_{\rm D}=256 K and \lambda = 0.77 for our calculations, and note that \alpha is not very sensitive to these parameters. \alpha_{\rm C} is sensitive to the Coulomb coupling constant between electrons (\mu*) however, which has been reported to be in the range 0.10-0.15. [21] This yields an expected \alpha_{\rm C} in the range of 0.4-0.45 from the general characterization of MgCNi_{3}. Our observed value of 0.54\pm0.03 for the isotope effect of carbon is higher than but similar to that value.

## Conclusions

To summarize we have measured the carbon isotope effect in MgCNi_{3}. The obtained value, \alpha_{\rm C}=0.54\pm0.03, is very close to what is expected for a phonon-mediated superconductor. This result indicates that carbon-based phonons play a critical role in the presence of superconductivity in this compound, which shows some unconventional characteristics in its superconducting state.

The carbon isotope effect \alpha_{\rm C}=0.54 is higher but similar to that reported for Rb_{3}C_{60}\alpha_{\rm C}=0.37, [22]^{0.21}, [23] and substantially higher than that for the related borocarbide YNi_{2}B_{2}C, where \alpha_{\rm C} is reported to be very close to zero (\alpha_{\rm C}=0.07). [24] For the borocarbide, however, the boron isotope effect is measured to be \alpha_{\rm B}=0.25 (Ref. [24]) and 0.21 (Ref. [25]) indicating a substantial contribution of boron derived phonons to the superconducting mechanism. The boron isotope effect value in the borocarbide is very close to that in MgB_{2}, reported to be in the range \alpha_{\rm B}=0.28 (Ref. [26]) to \alpha_{\rm B}=0.30 (Ref. [27]). The implication of our measurement is that the vibration of the carbon within the Ni_{6} octahedron strongly modulates the charge in the Ni--Ni near neighbor bonds that dominate the
