^{4}National Institute for Materials Science, 1-2 functionals[20] and ultrasoft pseudopotentials[21] were employed. The energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set was 380.0 eV. The Monkhorst-Pack grid separation[22] was set to \sim0.04 A^{-1}. The lattice parameters were set to the experimental values, and the atomic positions were optimized to minimize the total energy. The schematic images of the crystal structure were depicted using vesta.[23] The band structure of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} shown in Fig. 3 was calculated using the wien2k package.[24] A GGA-PBEsol exchange-correlation functional was adopted.[20] 512 k points and RK_{\rm max}=7.0 were taken. The spin-orbit interaction was omitted.

First, we show the physical properties of the new superconductor Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}. Figure 1(a) shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility (\chi) for Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} from 10 to 2 K. Both ZFC and FC data begin to decrease below 6 K as indicated by an arrow in the inset of Fig. 1(a). A large diamagnetic signal is observed below 4.5 K in the ZFC curve. The value of 4\pi\chi(ZFC) at 2 K exceeds -1, indicating that the shielding volume fraction at 2 K is almost 100%. Namely, Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} is a bulk superconductor. Figure 1(b) shows the temperature dependence of resistivity from 300 to 2 K for Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}. Resistivity linearly decreases with cooling and begins to drop below \sim8.6 K. An enlarged graph is displayed in the inset of Fig. 1(b). As indicated by an arrow in the inset, below 8.6 K, a decrease of resistivity--corresponding to the onset of superconducting transition--as clearly observed and resistivity reaches zero below 4.5 K. Temperature dependence of resistivity for Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} under magnetic fields up to 5 T is displayed in Fig. 1(c). The superconducting states are destroyed by applying high magnetic fields. The increase of resistivity with applying magnetic fields could be due to the magnetic resistance of the impurity phase of the Bi. To investigate the temperature-magnetic field phase diagram for the superconductivity of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, we plotted T_{c}^{\rm onset} and T_{c}^{\rm zero} with the respective applied magnetic fields in Fig. 1(d). The T_{c}^{\rm onset} at high magnetic fields was estimated as indicated by an arrow in the inset of Fig. 1(d). The T_{c}^{\rm zero} linearly decreases with increasing magnetic field. By a linear extrapolation, the irreversible field \mu_{0}H_{\rm zz}(0) is estimated to be \sim1 T. The upper critical field \mu_{0}H_{\rm zz}(0) was estimated to be \sim21 T using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory,[25] which gives \mu_{0}H_{zz}(0) = -0.69T_{c}(d\mu_{0}H_{zz}/dT)_{|T_{c}}, with a slope of T_{c}^{\rm onset} for H\geqslant 1.5 T. In the inset of Fig. 1(d), we note that the temperature dependence of resistivity at high fields shows

Figure 1: (Color) Superconducting properties of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}. (a) Temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility for Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}. The inset shows an enlargement of onset of the superconducting (diamagnetic) signal. (b) Temperature dependence of resistivity for Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}. The inset is an enlargement of onset of the superconducting transition. (c) Temperature dependence of resistivity for Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} under magnetic fields up to 5 T. (d) Magnetic field-temperature phase diagram in which the onset and zero-resistivity temperatures are plotted. The inset displays an enlarged superconducting transition of the temperature dependence of resistivity at 5 T.

  a semiconducting-like behavior above T_{\rm c}. This may indicate that superconductivity in Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} occurs at the vicinity of insulating states. To summarize the physical properties of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, the T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset} and T_{\rm c}^{\rm zero} are 8.6 and 4.5 K at 0 T, respectively. The broadness of the transition is probably caused by an inhomogeneity of the local structure, carrier doping level, and/or the superconductivity nature close to the insulating state.

Next, we show the crystal structure obtained by Rietveld refinement of the powder XRD pattern and DFT calculations. At first, by indexing the observed peaks except for the small impurity peaks belonging to Bi_{2}S_{3} and Bi, we obtained the I-centered tetragonal lattice with lattice parameters a=3.9592(1) and c=41.241(1) A. The extinction rule suggested either I4/mmm or I-42m space groups as candidates. By fitting the XRD pattern with only Bi atoms at the Bi1, Bi2, and Bi3 sites in Table 1, a reliability factor of R_{\rm up}=26.5\% was obtained. Furthermore, by adding S atoms at the S1, S2, and S3 sites in Table 1 to the refinement, an R_{\rm up}=16.0\% was achieved. Since both models for these space groups are completely identical, we selected the higher-symmetric I4/mmm. It is difficult to determine the O sites using only XRD data, therefore we performed structural optimization using DFT calculations. Additionally, we have confirmed the structural stability using molecular dynamics simulation. The atomic positions of Bi and S, determined by the XRD pattern, were only stable when the SO_{4} ions occupied z=0 and 0.5. By using the structural model, we performed Rietveld refinement. Figure 2(a) shows the XRD pattern of this sample and the result of Rietveld refinement (R_{\rm up}=14.41\%). The obtained atomic parameters and the site occupancy are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the XRD pattern is well fitted at the high angle region. A schematic image of the final crystal structure is shown in Fig. 2(c). The layered structure is composed of Bi_{2}S_{4} layers, Bi_{2}O_{2} layers, and SO_{4}. The fluorite-type Bi_{2}O_{2} layer is one of the well-known layers in the I4/mmm or P4/mmm tetragonal layered structures. In fact, Bi_{2}O_{2}SO_{4} is a known compound. The rocksalt-type Bi_{2}S_{4} layer structure has been found only in ROBiS_{2} (R= Ce, Gd, and Dy) with the P4/mmm space group.[26] Figure 2(d) is a schematic image of the Bi_{2}S_{4} layer projected along the c axis. The Bi and S atoms form square lattices. The elemental composition of this crystal structure can be described as Bi_{4}O_{4}(SO_{4})_{1-x}Bi_{2}S_{4} where x indicates the occupancy of the SO_{4} site. When all the sites are fully occupied, the atomic composition should be Bi_{4}O_{4}(SO_{4})Bi_{2}S_{4}, namely, Bi_{6}O_{8}S_{5}. If the occupancy of the SO_{4} site is 50%, the composition is Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} corresponding to the superconducting composition.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Site & x & y & z & Occupancy \\ Bi1 & 0 & 0 & 0.0576(1) & 1 \\ Bi2 & 0 & 0 & 0.2082(1) & 1 \\ Bi3 & 0 & 0 & 0.3810(1) & 1 \\ S1 & 0 & 0 & 0.1410(3) & 1 \\ S2 & 0 & 0 & 0.2868(4) & 1 \\ S3 & 0 & 0 & 0.5 & 1 \\ O1 & 0 & 0.5 & 0.0884 (fixed) & 1 \\ O2 & 0 & 0.3053 (fixed) & 0.4793 (fixed) & 0.5 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}

(b) XRD pattern at high angles. (c) Schematic image of the obtained crystal structure. Purple, yellow, and red circles indicate Bi, S, and O atoms, respectively. The occupancy of the O2 site (near z=0 and 0.5) is 0.5. The chemical composition can be described as Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{4}(SO_{4})_{1-x} when defects of SO_{4} ions exist. Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} corresponds to x=0.5 where the site occupancies of S3 and O2 in Table 1 are 0.5 and 0.25, respectively. (d) Schematic image of the BiS_{2} square lattice (ab plane).

  Therefore, we speculate that there are defects at the SO_{4} site in our Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} superconducting sample, because defects of molecules or ions at the interlayer site are often observed in layered compounds.

To discuss the nature of superconductivity in Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, we performed band calculations for the parent and superconducting phases. It is found that Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} (x = 0.5) is metallic, while Bi_{6}O_{5}S_{5} (x = 0) is a band insulator with Bi^{3+}. In fact, the SO_{4} deficiency generates electron carriers into the BiS_{2} layers. Figure 3 shows the band structure for x = 0.5 (Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}) obtained using the wienzk package adopting the lattice structure obtained as above.[24] The Fermi level lies within the bands which mainly originate from the Bi 6p orbitals. In particular, the Fermi level is just on the peak position of the partial density of states of the Bi 6p orbital within the BiS_{2} layer. Focusing on the contribution from the BiS_{2} layer, it is found that the band structure near the Fermi level consists of p_{x} and p_{y} orbital contributions, which in itself has a quasi-one-dimensional nature, but mixes around the R point to result in a two-dimensional band structure. This quasi-one-dimensionality of the band structure should give good nesting at the Fermi surface, and this electronic feature may cooperate with the bosonic modes that mediate the pairing to enhance the pairing interaction. The enhanced density of states at the Fermi level may also play a role in the Cooper pairing.

Finally, we compare the characteristics of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} with other layered superconductors. The crystal structure, composed of a stacking of the blocking and superconducting layers, resembles the cuprate and Fe-based superconductors. Furthermore, the fact that superconductivity occurs within the square-lattice sheets is a common feature. On the other hand, there are also some large differences in the electronic nature. The electronic bands that intersect the Fermi level of the cuprates and Fe-based superconductors originate mainly from the 3d orbitals, which have a localized nature. In the present BiS_{2}-based system, the relevant bands originate from the 6p orbitals, which should have a less localized nature, and superconductivity takes place when electrons are doped into these bands. In this sense, it is interesting to compare them with HfNCl and ZrNCl, i.e., the layered nitride family, whose superconducting mechanism is still not understood and under debate. The relevant bands in these materials originate from 4d or 5d (less localized than 3d) and 2p orbitals, and superconductivity occurs upon doping electrons in these bands.[27] In fact, the highest T_{\rm c} is obtained at the vicinity of the insulator-metal transition in the nitride family, and this system has provided us with physics of low-carrier superconductivity.[6, 7] A very small electronic specific-heat coefficient has been observed in ZrNCl,[28] and the relatively high T_{\rm c} despite the low density of states has been puzzling in these materials. In fact, as a preliminary result, we have also observed very small electronic-specific-heat coefficients in the bulk superconducting Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}.[29] Therefore, the similarity between these two series of materials is quite intriguing. Although the pairing mechanism of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} is unclear at present, we believe that detailed studies on superconductivity in BiS_{2}-based materials will provide new strategies to enhance T_{\rm c} in layered superconducting materials.

In conclusion, we have discovered a new layered superconductor Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}. The crystal structure was found to be composed of the stacking of the superconducting BiS_{2} layers and the blocking layers of Bi_{4}O_{4}(SO_{4})_{1-x}. Band calculations indicated that the Fermi level for Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} is just on the peak position of the partial density of states of the Bi 6p orbital within the BiS_{2} layer. Finally, we introduce our latest report of the observation of superconductivity above 10 K in electron-doped LaBiS_{2}, which has a layered structure composed of a stacking of the BiS_{2} superconducting layers and the La_{2}O_{2} spacer layers.[30] This strongly suggests that the BiS_{2} layer is a basic structure of a novel BiS_{2}-based superconducting family, which will open up a new field in the physics and chemistry of low-dimensional superconductors, as have cuprates and Fe-based superconductors.

^{4}National Institute for Materials Science, 1-2 functionals[20] and ultrasoft pseudopotentials[21] were employed. The energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set was 380.0 eV. The Monkhorst-Pack grid separation[22] was set to \sim0.04 A^{-1}. The lattice parameters were set to the experimental values, and the atomic positions were optimized to minimize the total energy. The schematic images of the crystal structure were depicted using vesta.[23] The band structure of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} shown in Fig. 3 was calculated using the wien2k package.[24] A GGA-PBEsol exchange-correlation functional was adopted.[20] 512 k points and RK_{\rm max}=7.0 were taken. The spin-orbit interaction was omitted.

First, we show the physical properties of the new superconductor Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}. Figure 1(a) shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility (\chi) for Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} from 10 to 2 K. Both ZFC and FC data begin to decrease below 6 K as indicated by an arrow in the inset of Fig. 1(a). A large diamagnetic signal is observed below 4.5 K in the ZFC curve. The value of 4\pi\chi(ZFC) at 2 K exceeds -1, indicating that the shielding volume fraction at 2 K is almost 100%. Namely, Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} is a bulk superconductor. Figure 1(b) shows the temperature dependence of resistivity from 300 to 2 K for Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}. Resistivity linearly decreases with cooling and begins to drop below \sim8.6 K. An enlarged graph is displayed in the inset of Fig. 1(b). As indicated by an arrow in the inset, below 8.6 K, a decrease of resistivity--corresponding to the onset of superconducting transition--as clearly observed and resistivity reaches zero below 4.5 K. Temperature dependence of resistivity for Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} under magnetic fields up to 5 T is displayed in Fig. 1(c). The superconducting states are destroyed by applying high magnetic fields. The increase of resistivity with applying magnetic fields could be due to the magnetic resistance of the impurity phase of the Bi. To investigate the temperature-magnetic field phase diagram for the superconductivity of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, we plotted T_{c}^{\rm onset} and T_{c}^{\rm zero} with the respective applied magnetic fields in Fig. 1(d). The T_{c}^{\rm onset} at high magnetic fields was estimated as indicated by an arrow in the inset of Fig. 1(d). The T_{c}^{\rm zero} linearly decreases with increasing magnetic field. By a linear extrapolation, the irreversible field \mu_{0}H_{\rm zz}(0) is estimated to be \sim1 T. The upper critical field \mu_{0}H_{\rm zz}(0) was estimated to be \sim21 T using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory,[25] which gives \mu_{0}H_{zz}(0) = -0.69T_{c}(d\mu_{0}H_{zz}/dT)_{|T_{c}}, with a slope of T_{c}^{\rm onset} for H\geqslant 1.5 T. In the inset of Fig. 1(d), we note that the temperature dependence of resistivity at high fields shows

Figure 1: (Color) Superconducting properties of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}. (a) Temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility for Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}. The inset shows an enlargement of onset of the superconducting (diamagnetic) signal. (b) Temperature dependence of resistivity for Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}. The inset is an enlargement of onset of the superconducting transition. (c) Temperature dependence of resistivity for Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} under magnetic fields up to 5 T. (d) Magnetic field-temperature phase diagram in which the onset and zero-resistivity temperatures are plotted. The inset displays an enlarged superconducting transition of the temperature dependence of resistivity at 5 T.

  a semiconducting-like behavior above T_{\rm c}. This may indicate that superconductivity in Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} occurs at the vicinity of insulating states. To summarize the physical properties of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, the T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset} and T_{\rm c}^{\rm zero} are 8.6 and 4.5 K at 0 T, respectively. The broadness of the transition is probably caused by an inhomogeneity of the local structure, carrier doping level, and/or the superconductivity nature close to the insulating state.

Next, we show the crystal structure obtained by Rietveld refinement of the powder XRD pattern and DFT calculations. At first, by indexing the observed peaks except for the small impurity peaks belonging to Bi_{2}S_{3} and Bi, we obtained the I-centered tetragonal lattice with lattice parameters a=3.9592(1) and c=41.241(1) A. The extinction rule suggested either I4/mmm or I-42m space groups as candidates. By fitting the XRD pattern with only Bi atoms at the Bi1, Bi2, and Bi3 sites in Table 1, a reliability factor of R_{\rm up}=26.5\% was obtained. Furthermore, by adding S atoms at the S1, S2, and S3 sites in Table 1 to the refinement, an R_{\rm up}=16.0\% was achieved. Since both models for these space groups are completely identical, we selected the higher-symmetric I4/mmm. It is difficult to determine the O sites using only XRD data, therefore we performed structural optimization using DFT calculations. Additionally, we have confirmed the structural stability using molecular dynamics simulation. The atomic positions of Bi and S, determined by the XRD pattern, were only stable when the SO_{4} ions occupied z=0 and 0.5. By using the structural model, we performed Rietveld refinement. Figure 2(a) shows the XRD pattern of this sample and the result of Rietveld refinement (R_{\rm up}=14.41\%). The obtained atomic parameters and the site occupancy are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the XRD pattern is well fitted at the high angle region. A schematic image of the final crystal structure is shown in Fig. 2(c). The layered structure is composed of Bi_{2}S_{4} layers, Bi_{2}O_{2} layers, and SO_{4}. The fluorite-type Bi_{2}O_{2} layer is one of the well-known layers in the I4/mmm or P4/mmm tetragonal layered structures. In fact, Bi_{2}O_{2}SO_{4} is a known compound. The rocksalt-type Bi_{2}S_{4} layer structure has been found only in ROBiS_{2} (R= Ce, Gd, and Dy) with the P4/mmm space group.[26] Figure 2(d) is a schematic image of the Bi_{2}S_{4} layer projected along the c axis. The Bi and S atoms form square lattices. The elemental composition of this crystal structure can be described as Bi_{4}O_{4}(SO_{4})_{1-x}Bi_{2}S_{4} where x indicates the occupancy of the SO_{4} site. When all the sites are fully occupied, the atomic composition should be Bi_{4}O_{4}(SO_{4})Bi_{2}S_{4}, namely, Bi_{6}O_{8}S_{5}. If the occupancy of the SO_{4} site is 50%, the composition is Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} corresponding to the superconducting composition.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Site & x & y & z & Occupancy \\ Bi1 & 0 & 0 & 0.0576(1) & 1 \\ Bi2 & 0 & 0 & 0.2082(1) & 1 \\ Bi3 & 0 & 0 & 0.3810(1) & 1 \\ S1 & 0 & 0 & 0.1410(3) & 1 \\ S2 & 0 & 0 & 0.2868(4) & 1 \\ S3 & 0 & 0 & 0.5 & 1 \\ O1 & 0 & 0.5 & 0.0884 (fixed) & 1 \\ O2 & 0 & 0.3053 (fixed) & 0.4793 (fixed) & 0.5 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}

(b) XRD pattern at high angles. (c) Schematic image of the obtained crystal structure. Purple, yellow, and red circles indicate Bi, S, and O atoms, respectively. The occupancy of the O2 site (near z=0 and 0.5) is 0.5. The chemical composition can be described as Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{4}(SO_{4})_{1-x} when defects of SO_{4} ions exist. Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} corresponds to x=0.5 where the site occupancies of S3 and O2 in Table 1 are 0.5 and 0.25, respectively. (d) Schematic image of the BiS_{2} square lattice (ab plane).

  Therefore, we speculate that there are defects at the SO_{4} site in our Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} superconducting sample, because defects of molecules or ions at the interlayer site are often observed in layered compounds.

To discuss the nature of superconductivity in Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, we performed band calculations for the parent and superconducting phases. It is found that Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} (x = 0.5) is metallic, while Bi_{6}O_{5}S_{5} (x = 0) is a band insulator with Bi^{3+}. In fact, the SO_{4} deficiency generates electron carriers into the BiS_{2} layers. Figure 3 shows the band structure for x = 0.5 (Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}) obtained using the wienzk package adopting the lattice structure obtained as above.[24] The Fermi level lies within the bands which mainly originate from the Bi 6p orbitals. In particular, the Fermi level is just on the peak position of the partial density of states of the Bi 6p orbital within the BiS_{2} layer. Focusing on the contribution from the BiS_{2} layer, it is found that the band structure near the Fermi level consists of p_{x} and p_{y} orbital contributions, which in itself has a quasi-one-dimensional nature, but mixes around the R point to result in a two-dimensional band structure. This quasi-one-dimensionality of the band structure should give good nesting at the Fermi surface, and this electronic feature may cooperate with the bosonic modes that mediate the pairing to enhance the pairing interaction. The enhanced density of states at the Fermi level may also play a role in the Cooper pairing.

Finally, we compare the characteristics of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} with other layered superconductors. The crystal structure, composed of a stacking of the blocking and superconducting layers, resembles the cuprate and Fe-based superconductors. Furthermore, the fact that superconductivity occurs within the square-lattice sheets is a common feature. On the other hand, there are also some large differences in the electronic nature. The electronic bands that intersect the Fermi level of the cuprates and Fe-based superconductors originate mainly from the 3d orbitals, which have a localized nature. In the present BiS_{2}-based system, the relevant bands originate from the 6p orbitals, which should have a less localized nature, and superconductivity takes place when electrons are doped into these bands. In this sense, it is interesting to compare them with HfNCl and ZrNCl, i.e., the layered nitride family, whose superconducting mechanism is still not understood and under debate. The relevant bands in these materials originate from 4d or 5d (less localized than 3d) and 2p orbitals, and superconductivity occurs upon doping electrons in these bands.[27] In fact, the highest T_{\rm c} is obtained at the vicinity of the insulator-metal transition in the nitride family, and this system has provided us with physics of low-carrier superconductivity.[6, 7] A very small electronic specific-heat coefficient has been observed in ZrNCl,[28] and the relatively high T_{\rm c} despite the low density of states has been puzzling in these materials. In fact, as a preliminary result, we have also observed very small electronic-specific-heat coefficients in the bulk superconducting Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}.[29] Therefore, the similarity between these two series of materials is quite intriguing. Although the pairing mechanism of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} is unclear at present, we believe that detailed studies on superconductivity in BiS_{2}-based materials will provide new strategies to enhance T_{\rm c} in layered superconducting materials.

In conclusion, we have discovered a new layered superconductor Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}. The crystal structure was found to be composed of the stacking of the superconducting BiS_{2} layers and the blocking layers of Bi_{4}O_{4}(SO_{4})_{1-x}. Band calculations indicated that the Fermi level for Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} is just on the peak position of the partial density of states of the Bi 6p orbital within the BiS_{2} layer. Finally, we introduce our latest report of the observation of superconductivity above 10 K in electron-doped LaBiS_{2}, which has a layered structure composed of a stacking of the BiS_{2} superconducting layers and the La_{2}O_{2} spacer layers.[30] This strongly suggests that the BiS_{2} layer is a basic structure of a novel BiS_{2}-based superconducting family, which will open up a new field in the physics and chemistry of low-dimensional superconductors, as have cuprates and Fe-based superconductors.
