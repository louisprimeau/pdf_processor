###### Abstract

We present measurements of the critical current in an epitaxial Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8} film as a function of the magnetic field, the temperature, and of the angle \vartheta between the field and the a,b planes. The orientational study reveals an increasing anisotropy in J_{c} with increasing temperature. The isothermal curves J_{c}(H) taken at various angles 0^{\circ}\leq\vartheta\leq 0^{\circ} are found to collapse to a single curve when the magnetic field is normalized to a scaling function f\left(\vartheta\right): J_{c}(H,\vartheta)\!=\!J_{c}\!\left[H/f\left(\vartheta\right)\right]. The best fit for f\left(\vartheta\right) is obtained using an expression originally derived for H_{c2}(T,\vartheta) by Tinkham. The increase in J_{c}(0^{\circ})/J_{c}(90^{\circ}) with increasing temperature is reflected by the increase in the anisotropy ratio f\left(0^{\circ}\right)/f\left(90^{\circ}\right), consistent with the quasi-two-dimensional Tinkham expression. Consistently, the same model quantitatively describes the increasing anisotropy with increasing temperature.

## I Introduction

One of the most striking phenomena in the transport properties on highly anisotropic high-temperature superconductors in a magnetic field is the behavior of the observed in-plane resistivity \rho as a function of the angle \vartheta, between the applied magnetic field \mathbf{H} and the CuO planes, and the angle \alpha between \mathbf{H} and the current density \mathbf{J}. Some of these phenomena are particularly evident in Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}CuO_{8}, and they undermine the traditional picture of fluxons moving under the opposite influence of a Lorentz-like driving force and of some pinning mechanism due to structural imperfections: First, there is no dependence of the observed resistivity [1, 2] and of the critical current [3] on the angle \alpha, contrary to what one could expect if the driving force were Lorentz-like. Further, the resistivity does not vanish if the field is parallel to the current. Second, columnar defects produced by heavy ion irradiation, that should give rise to an enhancement of the pinning force when the field is aligned parallel to the columns, seem to be ineffective: the \vartheta behavior of the critical current, in fact, shows no additional peak after irradiation [4]. Finally, in a small angular range near \vartheta\!=\!0^{\circ} (\Delta\vartheta\!=\!1^{\circ}), an unexpected increase of the dissipation has been observed, giving rise to a sharp peak in the resistivity when measured at high current densities [5] and in the microwave surface resistance [6].

All these puzzling features suggested the need of a more subtle fluxon statics and dynamics, possibly connected to the high anisotropy of these materials. In particular, it has been proposed that the flux lines could penetrate the sample in a stepwise manner: fluxons would then be made up of pancake vortices lying in the planes [7, 8] and Josephson fluxons parallel to the planes themselves, the last being locked to the interplane region and thus ineffective for the dissipation (intrinsic pinning model) [9, 10]. The predictions of this model agree with the J_{c} experiments only at low temperatures [namely, 4.2 K (Refs. 3 and 11)], while at higher temperatures the experimental framework is still controversial [3, 11].

A different approach is given by considering the dimensionality of the superconductor itself, instead of analyzing the detailed structure of the flux lines. If we think of the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}CuO_{8} sample as composed of a stack of superconducting and nonsuperconducting layers, with thicknesses d and s, respectively (this scenario seems to suit well several known properties of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}CuO_{9}), due to the very short out-of-plane coherence length \xi_{1} one can have a dimensional crossover in the superconducting material, with the following meaning: If d\!<\!\xi_{1}(0)\!<\!s/\sqrt{2}, each superconducting layer behaves like a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) superconductor [12]; approaching T_{c}, \xi_{1}(t) can overcome s/\sqrt{2}; the layers become interacting, and the superconductor is better described by a coupled-layers model, resulting in a 3D, anisotropic behavior [13]. Such a crossover, experimentally observed in Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}CuO_{8} close to T_{c} at very low current densities as depending on the temperature [14, 15] and on the magnetic field [16, 17], is a peculiar feature of layered superconductors, and it could be responsible for several physical properties of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}CuO_{8}.

In this paper we present a set of measurements of the critical current density J_{c} in an epitaxial Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}CuO_{8} film, as a function of the external magnetic field H, applied at variable angles \vartheta, in the range 40 K <T< 80 K. The experimental curves, J_{c}(H,\vartheta), are found to exhibit scaling features: It turns out that J_{c}(H,\vartheta)  =J_{c}[H/f(\vartheta)], where f(\vartheta) is a (temperature-dependent) point-defined scaling function. In other words, each curve collapses onto the orthogonal-field curve, J_{c}(H,90^{\circ}), if it is plotted as a function of H/f(\vartheta). The results clearly show strong deviations from the sin\vartheta scaling, thus ruling out the intrinsic pinning description in this range of temperature. Moreover, the obtained scaling function is fully described by a quasi-2D model in which the magnetic field has to be scaled with \vartheta according to the Tinkham law, written originally for the upper critical field H_{c2}[18]:

\[\frac{|H_{c2}(\vartheta)\sin(\vartheta)|}{H_{c21}}+\left[\frac{H_{c2}(\vartheta )\cos(\vartheta)}{H_{c21}}\right]^{2}=1\ .\] (1)

In addition, the resulting anisotropy ratio f(0^{\circ})/f(90^{\circ}) is found to grow with the temperature; it is shown that this behavior is fully consistent with the Tinkham-like scaling rule, giving internal consistency to the explanation proposed. To explain the results only general arguments on the dimensionality are needed, and no specific model based on specific forces acting on fluxons has to be invoked.

## II Experimental section

The sample is a Bi-2:2:1:2 film, epitaxially grown on a (001) oriented NdGaO_{3} substrate by liquid phase epitaxy. The mosaic spread is less than 0.15^{\circ}[19]. The film thickness is about 1 \mum. The film was patterned by scratching in a 2-mm-long, 100-\mum-wide strip. A standard four-probe configuration was obtained by gluing test leads with silver paint. Contacts were annealed for 1 h in air atmosphere at a temperature of 500^{\circ}C. The resistive transition measured at low current density (\approx1 A/cm^{2}) showed metallic behavior followed by a sharp transition (\Delta T_{c} = 3 K, 10-90 % criterion) with zero resistance (within the experimental resolution) at 82.4 K. The resistivity at room temperature is 210 \mu\Omega cm, and the extrapolated residual resistivity at zero temperature is about one tenth of that at room temperature.

The critical current measurements were performed by a stepped current source and a nanovoltmeter. A voltage criterion of 2 \muV/mm was chosen (no significant variation on J_{c} was found at 41 and 79 K by halving the voltage criterion). The sample holder was aligned with the a,b plane of the film lying on the vertical plane. The magnetic field (up to 2T) was supplied by a traditional electromagnet, that could rotate in a horizontal plane. The rotation angle \vartheta between the magnetic field and the basal plane was accurate to 0.1^{\circ}, that is comparable to the width of the mosaic spread, so that no smearing of J_{c}(\vartheta) curves should be due to the misorientation of the film. The current was directed along the a,b plane, and made the same angle \vartheta with the field. The insensitivity of the J_{c} measurements with respect to the relative orientation of the current and the field was checked, according with the literature [1, 2]. Special care was taken in the alignment for the parallel orientation. The temperature was measured by a platinum sensor, and it ranged between 40 and 80 K. Stabilization was within \pm0.03 K during each measurement. At every temperature and angle, measurements of the critical current were taken at several fields.

## III Experimental results

In Fig. 1 the temperature behavior of J_{c} for H=0 and for H=2 T, applied parallel (\vartheta=0^{\circ}), nearly parallel (\vartheta=1^{\circ}), and perpendicular (\vartheta=90^{\circ}) to the basal planes, is shown. The value of the critical current density at 77 K is about 1.5\times10^{3} A/cm^{2}, while at low temperatures it tends to the value of 3\times10^{4} A/cm^{2}. A perpendicular applied field is shown to induce a strong depression in the critical current density. Therefore, we extended the high-temperature measurements down to 1 mT to obtain a reasonably detailed field dependence of J_{c}. From the figure, two main qualitative features appear. First of all, the critical current at \vartheta=0^{\circ} is depressed with respect to that at \vartheta=1^{\circ}, from low temperature up to 65 K: this is equivalent to the anomalous enhancement of the dissipation in parallel field orientation found with different techniques [5, 6]. Second, the anisotropy in the critical current _increases_ with increasing temperature.

The anomalous behavior of the dissipation at \vartheta=0^{\circ} is reflected in the J_{c} measurements at low angles, presented in Fig. 2. As can be seen, the unexpected depression of the critical current density is more evident at low temperatures and disappears in the measurement at 71 K. At the present stage, a quantitative explanation of this anomalous dissipation peak at \vartheta=0^{\circ} is not available, and the effect seems to be sample dependent (for example, no such peak was found in J_{c} in Refs. 3 and 20); therefore, we will limit ourselves to the discussion of the data in the angular range that is not affected by the presence of the peak (the anomalous dissipation exists in a very narrow angular range-\Delta\vartheta\approx 0.5^{\circ}--so that for our measurements, only the data points at \vartheta=0^{\circ} and possibly at \vartheta=0.5^{\circ} should be neglected).

Figure 1: Temperature dependence of J_{c} in zero field (full circles) and at 2 T for different orientations: orthogonal field (\vartheta=90^{\circ}), open circles; parallel field (\vartheta=0^{\circ}), empty triangles; slightly misaligned (\vartheta=1^{\circ}), full triangles. Continuous lines are guides for the eye. Anomalously, the critical current at \vartheta=0^{\circ} is _lower_ than at \vartheta=1^{\circ} up to \approx65 K. The orthogonal field is shown to induce an abrupt fall in J_{c}.

  To show the increasing anisotropy with increasing temperature, in Fig. 3 some of the angular measurements of the critical current density normalized to the value in orthogonal field, at several temperatures, are reported. We use here a logarithmic scale for the angle, to enhance the behavior close to the parallel orientation (this choice does not allow us to display the data points at \vartheta = 0^{\prime}). The measurements were found to be symmetrical with respect to \vartheta = 0^{\prime}, so that no information is lost with displaying only the data for \vartheta > 0^{\prime}. The data clearly show that the anisotropy of J_{c} in a fixed applied field increases with increasing temperature and increasing field, ranging from \sim 2 at 41 K and 70 mT, up to \sim 2000 at 71 K and 0.7 T. We stress that the opposite behavior is present in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}: the anisotropy in the critical current density _decreases_ with increasing temperature.[21]

Figure 4: Typical scaling procedure. (a) Field dependence of J_{c} for different angles, raw data; (b) scaled data; each curve J_{c}(H) scales over the J_{c}(H_{\perp}) curve when plotted as J_{c} vs H//J(\vartheta) with an appropriate parameter f(\vartheta); (c) sin\vartheta scaling: curves are plotted as J_{c} vs H sin\vartheta. This scaling breaks down at relatively large angles (\vartheta \approx 5^{\prime}). Data are taken at T = 61 K.

Figure 3: Angular measurements for J_{c} normalized to the \vartheta = 90^{\prime} values, at different fixed fields and different temperatures. The anisotropy in J_{c} increases with increasing temperature at low as well as high fields. The \vartheta scale is logarithmic to enhance the low-angles behavior. Continuous lines are guides for the eye.

Figure 2: Low-angle measurements of J_{c} at 2 T, for several temperatures. The anomalous dip (increased dissipation) visible at \vartheta = \vartheta^{\prime} is found to disappear by raising the temperature. Continuous lines are guides for the eye.

  In Fig. 4(a) we report a typical measurement of J_{c} at fixed temperature, as a function of H for several values of \vartheta. All the curves at a given temperature appear to be translated with respect to each other along the x axis, when plotted on a logarithmic scale. This strongly suggests the definition of a parameter f(\vartheta) such that J_{c}(H,\vartheta)\!=\!J_{c}[H/f(\vartheta)]. This is the basis of the scaling procedure described in the following section.

## IV Scaling procedure and discussion

Before describing in detail the scaling procedure and the informations obtained from it, some general considerations are needed. Several attempts have been made to describe the field dependence of the critical current density in Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}CuO_{8}, most of these being based on the analysis of the so-called volume pinning force.[3, 22] The agreement with the well-known result by Kramer[23]F_{p}\propto(H/H_{c2})^{1/2}(1-H/H_{c2})^{2} is quantitative, if a different characteristic field H^{*} replaces H_{c2}. However, since the Kramer's expression for the pinning force is obtained from the balance between the pinning force and the Lorentz force acting on a flux line, and the dissipation in Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}CuO_{8} has been shown to be independent on the latter,[1]^{-\delta} we think that the experimental frame is not fully consistent with this kind of approach. For these reasons, in the discussion of the data, we will not focus on the volume pinning force, but instead we will work directly on the J_{c}(H) curves, taken at different angles \vartheta, showing that they scale on the J_{c}(H_{1}) curve with a temperature-dependent scaling function, and we will identify such function with the one corresponding to Eq. (1). While a scaling procedure has been employed in the past for J_{c} measurements,[3, 24] up to now no detailed determination of the scaling function and of its temperature dependence has been given.

In Fig. 4(b) we plot the J_{c}(H) curves at various \vartheta versus H/f(\vartheta), where f(\vartheta) is the scaling parameter necessary to make the curves collapse on the curve J_{c}(H,\vartheta\!=\!90^{\prime}). For comparison, in (c) the same curves are plotted as a function of H\sin\vartheta, that is assuming that only the transverse component of the field is effective. It is immediately apparent that the simple \sin\vartheta scaling undergoes a breakdown for \vartheta\!\approx\!5^{*} [this result is in agreement with microwave measurements on samples from the same batch (Refs. [6] and [25]). We stress that the breakdown of the \sin\vartheta scaling appears at angles much larger than the mosaic spread, and also much larger than the width of the dip at \vartheta\!=\!0^{\prime}, so that we can attribute it to intrinsic properties. The breakdown in the \sin\vartheta scaling involves that also the parallel component of the applied magnetic field causes a dissipation. In Fig. 5 collapsed curves at several temperatures are shown. The data at \vartheta\!=\!0^{\prime} were not scaled due to the presence of the anomalous dip in J_{c}, but this lack of data does not prevent us from obtaining interesting results.

From the scaling procedure, we then obtain at each temperature a point-defined function f(\vartheta), to be compared with theoretical predictions. In Fig. 6 we report the scaling functions for several temperatures (a log axis for the angle has been chosen to make the low-angles behavior clear). By construction, the point at \vartheta\!=\!90^{\prime} is always 1; from this plot, the fact that the anisotropy increases with increasing temperature assumes a quantitative aspect.

Due to the failure of the \sin\vartheta scaling, a different theoretical curve is needed for f(\vartheta). Alternative scaling functions are suggested by the work of Hao and Clem:[26] they demonstrated that the Gibbs free-energy difference between the superconducting and normal state depends on H only through the ratio H/H_{c2}(\vartheta); moreover, from the fact that the anisotropic properties of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8} do not depend on the relative direction between the field and a transport current, but only on the direction between the field and the crystallographic axes, they inferred that also nonequilibrium quantities such as the resistivity and the critical current should depend on H/H_{c2} only. This result allows us to use the anisotropic behavior of the critical field as an angular scaling function, as will be done below.

The best known models that led to explicit analytical functions for H_{c2}(\vartheta) are the Tinkham model for a single slab of finite thickness,[18] Eq. (1), and the Lawrence-Doniach (LD) model for Josephson-coupled layers.[13] The latter model gives the result

\[\left\lfloor\frac{H_{c2}(\vartheta)\sin\vartheta}{H_{c2\downarrow}}\right\rfloor ^{2}+\,\left\lfloor\frac{H_{c2}(\vartheta)\cos\vartheta}{H_{c2\downarrow}} \right\rfloor^{2}\!=\!1\] (2)

with the same meaning of the symbols as in Eq. (1). The scaling functions are obtained from Eqs. (1) and (2), written in the form

\[H_{c2}(\vartheta)\!=\!H_{c2\downarrow}f(\vartheta)\;.\]

The resulting scaling functions are, respectively,

Figure 5: Collapsed J_{c} vs H/f(\vartheta) at several temperatures. The presented data are at \vartheta\!=\!30^{\prime} (full circles), \vartheta\!=\!10^{\prime} (open circles), \vartheta\!=\!5^{\prime} (full triangles), \vartheta\!=\!2^{\prime} (open triangles), \vartheta\!=\!1^{*} (full squares), and \vartheta\!=\!0.5^{*} (open squares). The scaling curves, J_{c}(H,90^{\prime}), are plotted with continuous lines.

  \[f_{\Upsilon}(\vartheta) = \frac{1}{2(H_{e21}/H_{e21})^{2}\cos^{2}\vartheta}\] (3) \[\times[\sqrt{\sin^{2}\vartheta+4(H_{e21}/H_{e21})^{2}\cos^{2} \vartheta}-|\sin\vartheta|]\] \[= \frac{1}{2\varepsilon^{-2}\cos^{2}\vartheta}[\sqrt{\sin^{2} \vartheta+4\varepsilon^{-2}\cos^{2}\vartheta}-|\sin\vartheta|]\]

and

\[f_{\rm LD}(  Finally, we note that the dimensional crossover from a quasi-2D to a 3D situation obtained by further increasing the temperature [14, 15, 17] could not be observed by the study of the critical currents: the strong depression of J_{c} in perpendicular field does not allow a detailed study at temperatures close to T_{c}, and different techniques are needed.

## V Conclusions

We presented measurements of the critical current density in an epitaxial Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8} film, as a function of the external magnetic field for several field orientations and temperatures. The magnetic-field curves of J_{c} at different angles are found to collapse on the orthogonal-field curve; the scaling law is found to be the quasi-2D Tinkham formula, Eq. (3); the extracted anisotropy ratio is temperature dependent, and it increases with increasing temperature. This finding is consistent with the Tinkham's predictions; in particular the square-root law (5) is found to describe well the data. A coupled-layers scaling function (Lawrence and Doniach model) could describe the J_{c} scaling reasonably well, but is unable to explain the temperature-dependent anisotropy ratio.

###### Abstract

We present measurements of the critical current in an epitaxial Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8} film as a function of the magnetic field, the temperature, and of the angle \vartheta between the field and the a,b planes. The orientational study reveals an increasing anisotropy in J_{c} with increasing temperature. The isothermal curves J_{c}(H) taken at various angles 0^{\circ}\leq\vartheta\leq 0^{\circ} are found to collapse to a single curve when the magnetic field is normalized to a scaling function f\left(\vartheta\right): J_{c}(H,\vartheta)\!=\!J_{c}\!\left[H/f\left(\vartheta\right)\right]. The best fit for f\left(\vartheta\right) is obtained using an expression originally derived for H_{c2}(T,\vartheta) by Tinkham. The increase in J_{c}(0^{\circ})/J_{c}(90^{\circ}) with increasing temperature is reflected by the increase in the anisotropy ratio f\left(0^{\circ}\right)/f\left(90^{\circ}\right), consistent with the quasi-two-dimensional Tinkham expression. Consistently, the same model quantitatively describes the increasing anisotropy with increasing temperature.

## I Introduction

One of the most striking phenomena in the transport properties on highly anisotropic high-temperature superconductors in a magnetic field is the behavior of the observed in-plane resistivity \rho as a function of the angle \vartheta, between the applied magnetic field \mathbf{H} and the CuO planes, and the angle \alpha between \mathbf{H} and the current density \mathbf{J}. Some of these phenomena are particularly evident in Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}CuO_{8}, and they undermine the traditional picture of fluxons moving under the opposite influence of a Lorentz-like driving force and of some pinning mechanism due to structural imperfections: First, there is no dependence of the observed resistivity [1, 2] and of the critical current [3] on the angle \alpha, contrary to what one could expect if the driving force were Lorentz-like. Further, the resistivity does not vanish if the field is parallel to the current. Second, columnar defects produced by heavy ion irradiation, that should give rise to an enhancement of the pinning force when the field is aligned parallel to the columns, seem to be ineffective: the \vartheta behavior of the critical current, in fact, shows no additional peak after irradiation [4]. Finally, in a small angular range near \vartheta\!=\!0^{\circ} (\Delta\vartheta\!=\!1^{\circ}), an unexpected increase of the dissipation has been observed, giving rise to a sharp peak in the resistivity when measured at high current densities [5] and in the microwave surface resistance [6].

All these puzzling features suggested the need of a more subtle fluxon statics and dynamics, possibly connected to the high anisotropy of these materials. In particular, it has been proposed that the flux lines could penetrate the sample in a stepwise manner: fluxons would then be made up of pancake vortices lying in the planes [7, 8] and Josephson fluxons parallel to the planes themselves, the last being locked to the interplane region and thus ineffective for the dissipation (intrinsic pinning model) [9, 10]. The predictions of this model agree with the J_{c} experiments only at low temperatures [namely, 4.2 K (Refs. 3 and 11)], while at higher temperatures the experimental framework is still controversial [3, 11].

A different approach is given by considering the dimensionality of the superconductor itself, instead of analyzing the detailed structure of the flux lines. If we think of the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}CuO_{8} sample as composed of a stack of superconducting and nonsuperconducting layers, with thicknesses d and s, respectively (this scenario seems to suit well several known properties of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}CuO_{9}), due to the very short out-of-plane coherence length \xi_{1} one can have a dimensional crossover in the superconducting material, with the following meaning: If d\!<\!\xi_{1}(0)\!<\!s/\sqrt{2}, each superconducting layer behaves like a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) superconductor [12]; approaching T_{c}, \xi_{1}(t) can overcome s/\sqrt{2}; the layers become interacting, and the superconductor is better described by a coupled-layers model, resulting in a 3D, anisotropic behavior [13]. Such a crossover, experimentally observed in Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}CuO_{8} close to T_{c} at very low current densities as depending on the temperature [14, 15] and on the magnetic field [16, 17], is a peculiar feature of layered superconductors, and it could be responsible for several physical properties of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}CuO_{8}.

In this paper we present a set of measurements of the critical current density J_{c} in an epitaxial Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}CuO_{8} film, as a function of the external magnetic field H, applied at variable angles \vartheta, in the range 40 K <T< 80 K. The experimental curves, J_{c}(H,\vartheta), are found to exhibit scaling features: It turns out that J_{c}(H,\vartheta)  =J_{c}[H/f(\vartheta)], where f(\vartheta) is a (temperature-dependent) point-defined scaling function. In other words, each curve collapses onto the orthogonal-field curve, J_{c}(H,90^{\circ}), if it is plotted as a function of H/f(\vartheta). The results clearly show strong deviations from the sin\vartheta scaling, thus ruling out the intrinsic pinning description in this range of temperature. Moreover, the obtained scaling function is fully described by a quasi-2D model in which the magnetic field has to be scaled with \vartheta according to the Tinkham law, written originally for the upper critical field H_{c2}[18]:

\[\frac{|H_{c2}(\vartheta)\sin(\vartheta)|}{H_{c21}}+\left[\frac{H_{c2}(\vartheta )\cos(\vartheta)}{H_{c21}}\right]^{2}=1\ .\] (1)

In addition, the resulting anisotropy ratio f(0^{\circ})/f(90^{\circ}) is found to grow with the temperature; it is shown that this behavior is fully consistent with the Tinkham-like scaling rule, giving internal consistency to the explanation proposed. To explain the results only general arguments on the dimensionality are needed, and no specific model based on specific forces acting on fluxons has to be invoked.

## II Experimental section

The sample is a Bi-2:2:1:2 film, epitaxially grown on a (001) oriented NdGaO_{3} substrate by liquid phase epitaxy. The mosaic spread is less than 0.15^{\circ}[19]. The film thickness is about 1 \mum. The film was patterned by scratching in a 2-mm-long, 100-\mum-wide strip. A standard four-probe configuration was obtained by gluing test leads with silver paint. Contacts were annealed for 1 h in air atmosphere at a temperature of 500^{\circ}C. The resistive transition measured at low current density (\approx1 A/cm^{2}) showed metallic behavior followed by a sharp transition (\Delta T_{c} = 3 K, 10-90 % criterion) with zero resistance (within the experimental resolution) at 82.4 K. The resistivity at room temperature is 210 \mu\Omega cm, and the extrapolated residual resistivity at zero temperature is about one tenth of that at room temperature.

The critical current measurements were performed by a stepped current source and a nanovoltmeter. A voltage criterion of 2 \muV/mm was chosen (no significant variation on J_{c} was found at 41 and 79 K by halving the voltage criterion). The sample holder was aligned with the a,b plane of the film lying on the vertical plane. The magnetic field (up to 2T) was supplied by a traditional electromagnet, that could rotate in a horizontal plane. The rotation angle \vartheta between the magnetic field and the basal plane was accurate to 0.1^{\circ}, that is comparable to the width of the mosaic spread, so that no smearing of J_{c}(\vartheta) curves should be due to the misorientation of the film. The current was directed along the a,b plane, and made the same angle \vartheta with the field. The insensitivity of the J_{c} measurements with respect to the relative orientation of the current and the field was checked, according with the literature [1, 2]. Special care was taken in the alignment for the parallel orientation. The temperature was measured by a platinum sensor, and it ranged between 40 and 80 K. Stabilization was within \pm0.03 K during each measurement. At every temperature and angle, measurements of the critical current were taken at several fields.

## III Experimental results

In Fig. 1 the temperature behavior of J_{c} for H=0 and for H=2 T, applied parallel (\vartheta=0^{\circ}), nearly parallel (\vartheta=1^{\circ}), and perpendicular (\vartheta=90^{\circ}) to the basal planes, is shown. The value of the critical current density at 77 K is about 1.5\times10^{3} A/cm^{2}, while at low temperatures it tends to the value of 3\times10^{4} A/cm^{2}. A perpendicular applied field is shown to induce a strong depression in the critical current density. Therefore, we extended the high-temperature measurements down to 1 mT to obtain a reasonably detailed field dependence of J_{c}. From the figure, two main qualitative features appear. First of all, the critical current at \vartheta=0^{\circ} is depressed with respect to that at \vartheta=1^{\circ}, from low temperature up to 65 K: this is equivalent to the anomalous enhancement of the dissipation in parallel field orientation found with different techniques [5, 6]. Second, the anisotropy in the critical current _increases_ with increasing temperature.

The anomalous behavior of the dissipation at \vartheta=0^{\circ} is reflected in the J_{c} measurements at low angles, presented in Fig. 2. As can be seen, the unexpected depression of the critical current density is more evident at low temperatures and disappears in the measurement at 71 K. At the present stage, a quantitative explanation of this anomalous dissipation peak at \vartheta=0^{\circ} is not available, and the effect seems to be sample dependent (for example, no such peak was found in J_{c} in Refs. 3 and 20); therefore, we will limit ourselves to the discussion of the data in the angular range that is not affected by the presence of the peak (the anomalous dissipation exists in a very narrow angular range-\Delta\vartheta\approx 0.5^{\circ}--so that for our measurements, only the data points at \vartheta=0^{\circ} and possibly at \vartheta=0.5^{\circ} should be neglected).

Figure 1: Temperature dependence of J_{c} in zero field (full circles) and at 2 T for different orientations: orthogonal field (\vartheta=90^{\circ}), open circles; parallel field (\vartheta=0^{\circ}), empty triangles; slightly misaligned (\vartheta=1^{\circ}), full triangles. Continuous lines are guides for the eye. Anomalously, the critical current at \vartheta=0^{\circ} is _lower_ than at \vartheta=1^{\circ} up to \approx65 K. The orthogonal field is shown to induce an abrupt fall in J_{c}.

  To show the increasing anisotropy with increasing temperature, in Fig. 3 some of the angular measurements of the critical current density normalized to the value in orthogonal field, at several temperatures, are reported. We use here a logarithmic scale for the angle, to enhance the behavior close to the parallel orientation (this choice does not allow us to display the data points at \vartheta = 0^{\prime}). The measurements were found to be symmetrical with respect to \vartheta = 0^{\prime}, so that no information is lost with displaying only the data for \vartheta > 0^{\prime}. The data clearly show that the anisotropy of J_{c} in a fixed applied field increases with increasing temperature and increasing field, ranging from \sim 2 at 41 K and 70 mT, up to \sim 2000 at 71 K and 0.7 T. We stress that the opposite behavior is present in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}: the anisotropy in the critical current density _decreases_ with increasing temperature.[21]

Figure 4: Typical scaling procedure. (a) Field dependence of J_{c} for different angles, raw data; (b) scaled data; each curve J_{c}(H) scales over the J_{c}(H_{\perp}) curve when plotted as J_{c} vs H//J(\vartheta) with an appropriate parameter f(\vartheta); (c) sin\vartheta scaling: curves are plotted as J_{c} vs H sin\vartheta. This scaling breaks down at relatively large angles (\vartheta \approx 5^{\prime}). Data are taken at T = 61 K.

Figure 3: Angular measurements for J_{c} normalized to the \vartheta = 90^{\prime} values, at different fixed fields and different temperatures. The anisotropy in J_{c} increases with increasing temperature at low as well as high fields. The \vartheta scale is logarithmic to enhance the low-angles behavior. Continuous lines are guides for the eye.

Figure 2: Low-angle measurements of J_{c} at 2 T, for several temperatures. The anomalous dip (increased dissipation) visible at \vartheta = \vartheta^{\prime} is found to disappear by raising the temperature. Continuous lines are guides for the eye.

  In Fig. 4(a) we report a typical measurement of J_{c} at fixed temperature, as a function of H for several values of \vartheta. All the curves at a given temperature appear to be translated with respect to each other along the x axis, when plotted on a logarithmic scale. This strongly suggests the definition of a parameter f(\vartheta) such that J_{c}(H,\vartheta)\!=\!J_{c}[H/f(\vartheta)]. This is the basis of the scaling procedure described in the following section.

## IV Scaling procedure and discussion

Before describing in detail the scaling procedure and the informations obtained from it, some general considerations are needed. Several attempts have been made to describe the field dependence of the critical current density in Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}CuO_{8}, most of these being based on the analysis of the so-called volume pinning force.[3, 22] The agreement with the well-known result by Kramer[23]F_{p}\propto(H/H_{c2})^{1/2}(1-H/H_{c2})^{2} is quantitative, if a different characteristic field H^{*} replaces H_{c2}. However, since the Kramer's expression for the pinning force is obtained from the balance between the pinning force and the Lorentz force acting on a flux line, and the dissipation in Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}CuO_{8} has been shown to be independent on the latter,[1]^{-\delta} we think that the experimental frame is not fully consistent with this kind of approach. For these reasons, in the discussion of the data, we will not focus on the volume pinning force, but instead we will work directly on the J_{c}(H) curves, taken at different angles \vartheta, showing that they scale on the J_{c}(H_{1}) curve with a temperature-dependent scaling function, and we will identify such function with the one corresponding to Eq. (1). While a scaling procedure has been employed in the past for J_{c} measurements,[3, 24] up to now no detailed determination of the scaling function and of its temperature dependence has been given.

In Fig. 4(b) we plot the J_{c}(H) curves at various \vartheta versus H/f(\vartheta), where f(\vartheta) is the scaling parameter necessary to make the curves collapse on the curve J_{c}(H,\vartheta\!=\!90^{\prime}). For comparison, in (c) the same curves are plotted as a function of H\sin\vartheta, that is assuming that only the transverse component of the field is effective. It is immediately apparent that the simple \sin\vartheta scaling undergoes a breakdown for \vartheta\!\approx\!5^{*} [this result is in agreement with microwave measurements on samples from the same batch (Refs. [6] and [25]). We stress that the breakdown of the \sin\vartheta scaling appears at angles much larger than the mosaic spread, and also much larger than the width of the dip at \vartheta\!=\!0^{\prime}, so that we can attribute it to intrinsic properties. The breakdown in the \sin\vartheta scaling involves that also the parallel component of the applied magnetic field causes a dissipation. In Fig. 5 collapsed curves at several temperatures are shown. The data at \vartheta\!=\!0^{\prime} were not scaled due to the presence of the anomalous dip in J_{c}, but this lack of data does not prevent us from obtaining interesting results.

From the scaling procedure, we then obtain at each temperature a point-defined function f(\vartheta), to be compared with theoretical predictions. In Fig. 6 we report the scaling functions for several temperatures (a log axis for the angle has been chosen to make the low-angles behavior clear). By construction, the point at \vartheta\!=\!90^{\prime} is always 1; from this plot, the fact that the anisotropy increases with increasing temperature assumes a quantitative aspect.

Due to the failure of the \sin\vartheta scaling, a different theoretical curve is needed for f(\vartheta). Alternative scaling functions are suggested by the work of Hao and Clem:[26] they demonstrated that the Gibbs free-energy difference between the superconducting and normal state depends on H only through the ratio H/H_{c2}(\vartheta); moreover, from the fact that the anisotropic properties of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8} do not depend on the relative direction between the field and a transport current, but only on the direction between the field and the crystallographic axes, they inferred that also nonequilibrium quantities such as the resistivity and the critical current should depend on H/H_{c2} only. This result allows us to use the anisotropic behavior of the critical field as an angular scaling function, as will be done below.

The best known models that led to explicit analytical functions for H_{c2}(\vartheta) are the Tinkham model for a single slab of finite thickness,[18] Eq. (1), and the Lawrence-Doniach (LD) model for Josephson-coupled layers.[13] The latter model gives the result

\[\left\lfloor\frac{H_{c2}(\vartheta)\sin\vartheta}{H_{c2\downarrow}}\right\rfloor ^{2}+\,\left\lfloor\frac{H_{c2}(\vartheta)\cos\vartheta}{H_{c2\downarrow}} \right\rfloor^{2}\!=\!1\] (2)

with the same meaning of the symbols as in Eq. (1). The scaling functions are obtained from Eqs. (1) and (2), written in the form

\[H_{c2}(\vartheta)\!=\!H_{c2\downarrow}f(\vartheta)\;.\]

The resulting scaling functions are, respectively,

Figure 5: Collapsed J_{c} vs H/f(\vartheta) at several temperatures. The presented data are at \vartheta\!=\!30^{\prime} (full circles), \vartheta\!=\!10^{\prime} (open circles), \vartheta\!=\!5^{\prime} (full triangles), \vartheta\!=\!2^{\prime} (open triangles), \vartheta\!=\!1^{*} (full squares), and \vartheta\!=\!0.5^{*} (open squares). The scaling curves, J_{c}(H,90^{\prime}), are plotted with continuous lines.

  \[f_{\Upsilon}(\vartheta) = \frac{1}{2(H_{e21}/H_{e21})^{2}\cos^{2}\vartheta}\] (3) \[\times[\sqrt{\sin^{2}\vartheta+4(H_{e21}/H_{e21})^{2}\cos^{2} \vartheta}-|\sin\vartheta|]\] \[= \frac{1}{2\varepsilon^{-2}\cos^{2}\vartheta}[\sqrt{\sin^{2} \vartheta+4\varepsilon^{-2}\cos^{2}\vartheta}-|\sin\vartheta|]\]

and

\[f_{\rm LD}(  Finally, we note that the dimensional crossover from a quasi-2D to a 3D situation obtained by further increasing the temperature [14, 15, 17] could not be observed by the study of the critical currents: the strong depression of J_{c} in perpendicular field does not allow a detailed study at temperatures close to T_{c}, and different techniques are needed.

## V Conclusions

We presented measurements of the critical current density in an epitaxial Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8} film, as a function of the external magnetic field for several field orientations and temperatures. The magnetic-field curves of J_{c} at different angles are found to collapse on the orthogonal-field curve; the scaling law is found to be the quasi-2D Tinkham formula, Eq. (3); the extracted anisotropy ratio is temperature dependent, and it increases with increasing temperature. This finding is consistent with the Tinkham's predictions; in particular the square-root law (5) is found to describe well the data. A coupled-layers scaling function (Lawrence and Doniach model) could describe the J_{c} scaling reasonably well, but is unable to explain the temperature-dependent anisotropy ratio.
