###### Abstract

We report the discovery of superconductivity in pressurized CeRhGe_{3}, a nonsuperconducting member of the isostructural family of noncentrosymmetric heavy-fermion compounds CeT\,X_{3} (T= Co, Rh, Ir and X= Si, Ge). Superconductivity appears in CeRhGe_{3} at a pressure of 19.6 GPa and the transition temperature T_{C} reaches a maximum value of 1.3 K at 21.5 GPa. This finding provides an opportunity to establish systematic correlations between superconductivity and material properties within this family. Though ambient-pressure unit-cell volumes and critical pressures for superconductivity vary substantially across the series, all family members reach a maximum T_{C}^{\rm max} at a common (\pm1.7%) critical cell volume V_{\rm crit}, and T_{C}^{\rm max} at V_{\rm crit} increases with increasing spin-orbit coupling strength of the d electrons. These correlations show that substantial Kondo and spin-orbit couplings favor superconductivity in this family, the latter reflecting the role of broken centrosymmetry.

## I Introduction

The discovery of the first heavy-fermion superconductor CeCu_{2}Si_{2} in 1979 [1] opened the new field of unconventional superconductivity and posed a fundamental challenge for understanding the superconducting mechanism. After nearly 40 years, more than 40 heavy-fermion superconductors have been found, and there is growing appreciation that their superconductivity emerges at the border of competing or coexisting electronic orders [2], suggesting that fluctuations of these orders may be the source of superconductivity. Among heavy-fermion compounds, the CeT\,X_{3} (T= Co, Ir, Rh and X= Si, Ge) [3, 4] family belongs to a subset whose crystallographic structure (I4mm) lacks a center of inversion symmetry [5, 6]. Except for the mixed-valence member CeCoSi_{3}, others of the family order antiferromagnetically at atmospheric pressure. Application of pressure to CeRhSi_{3}, CeIrSi_{3}, and CeCoGe_{3}, CeIrGe_{3} suppresses their Neel temperature toward zero temperature where a dome of superconductivity emerges [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. These observations have led to suggestions that magnetic fluctuations may induce unconventional superconductivity, but this remains unsettled, in part because of the possible nontrivial role of antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling that is a consequence of these materials' noncentrosymmetry [6]. Besides its possible role in forming superconductivity, sufficiently strong spin-orbit coupling would also lead to an unusual pairing state that is a mixture of spin-singlet and spin-triplet components.

As a member of the magnetic CeT\,X_{3} family, CeRhGe_{3} is expected to become superconducting under pressure. However, experiments to about 8 GPa find only a monotonic increase in its Neel temperature [15]. Here, we report an observation of pressure-induced superconductivity in CeRhGe_{3}. As will be discussed, this discovery allows a broader perspective on conditions favoring superconductivity in this family of nominally isoelectronic compounds.

## II Experimental Details

Single crystals of CeRhGe_{3} were grown from a Rh_{0.25}Ge_{0.75} eutectic self-flux (T_{\rm melt}=850\,^{\circ}C) [19, 20]. The elements Ce, Rh, Ge were are melted together in a molar ratio of Ce : Rh : Ge = 1 : 3.5 : 13.5 (corresponding to CeRhGe_{6}+10 Rh_{0.25}Ge_{0.75}) on a water-cooled copper hearth in an ultrahigh-purity Ar atmosphere. The arc-melted button was then placed in a 2-ml alumina crucible and sealed under vacuum in a silica tube. The tube was heated to 1150\,^{\circ}C, held at that temperature for 12 h, and then cooled slowly at 2\,^{\circ}C/h to 875\,^{\circ}C. The excess flux was removed by spinning the (inverted) silica tube in a centrifuge. Single crystals of CeRhGe_{3} in the form of three-dimensional, tetrahedral-like blocks with well-defined facets and volumes ranging from 1 to 4\,mm^{3} were obtained.

High-pressure resistance and magnetoresistance measurements were carried out in a diamond-anvil cell made of a Be-Cu alloy. Diamond anvils with 300-\mum flats were used for all high-pressure experiments. In the resistance measurements, NaCl powder was employed as the pressure-transmitting medium to obtain a quasibrostatic pressure environment, which has been widely used for high-pressure transport measurements [21]. The four-probe method determined the _ab_ plane resistance of the single-crystal sample. In our high-pressure ac susceptibility measurements, the sample is surrounded by a secondary coil (pickup coil) and a field-generating primary coil is wound on top of the secondary coil. The alternating flux through the pickup coil produces an ac voltage which is the measured signal. When the sample is cooled below T_{C}, the field is expelled from the sample due to the superconducting shielding effect, forcing some of the flux lines out of the pickup coil and leading to a reduction in the induced voltage in the pickup coil [22; 23; 24; 25]. A lock-in amplifier (SR830) is used to generate an ac magnetic field through the primary coil and to detect the drop in the induced voltage through the secondary coil. The frequency used for the \chi^{^{\prime}} data is 217 Hz, and the primary coil yields a magnetic field of 3 Oe at this frequency. The balanced secondary coils are connected with a lock-in amplifier. In order to minimize this temperature-dependent background, we used a high-pressure cell made from a Be-Cu alloy to generate pressure and a Be-Cu sheet as a gasket, because the Be-Cu alloy is a nonmagnetic material. Even so, we first measured the ac susceptibility for the high-pressure cell, without a sample but with coils and gaskets, to get the background, and then performed the ac susceptibility measurement for the sample in the same high-pressure cell. To pick up the signal from the sample carefully, we did the background subtraction.

High-pressure x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed at room temperature on beamline 15U at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility and beamline 4W2 at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Diamonds with low birefringence were selected for these XRD measurements. A monochromatic x-ray beam with a wavelength of 0.6199 A was employed and silicon oil served as a pressure-transmitting medium [26; 27; 28].

The high-pressure heat capacity of the sample under pressure was derived from ac calorimetry. Pressure is determined by the pressure dependence of T_{C} of Pb [29] that is placed together with the sample in a Teflon capsule. In this technique, a small temperature oscillation \Delta T generated by a heater glued to one face of the crystal is converted to an ac voltage signal by a chromel-AuFe (0.07%) thermocouple fixed on the opposite side and C\propto 1/T. The pressure for all measurements in a diamond-anvil cell was determined by the ruby fluorescence method [30].

## III Results and discussions

High-pressure heat capacity measurements down to 4 K reveal two anomalies that, like CeIrGe [4], are associated with antiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions (see Fig. 1). We denote the higher AFM transition as T_{N1} and the lower one by T_{N2}. These two AFM transitions at T_{N1} and T_{N2} are identified from our high-pressure resistance measurements and the minima in second derivatives of the resistivity (Figs. 2 and 3). Figure 2(a) shows temperature dependence of resistance for CeRhGe_{3} at ambient pressure, from which T_{N1} and T_{N2} can be observed (as indicated by arrows in the inset of the figure). With increasing pressure, T_{N1} and T_{N2} move to higher temperatures [Figs. 2(b) and 3(a)], consistent with the previously reported pressure dependence of T_{N1}[15]. T_{N1} reaches a maximum at 8.5 GPa and T_{N2} is maximized near 10.5 GPa. Both transitions decrease at higher pressures and merge at \sim13.7 GPa within experimental resolution. This is seen most clearly in the pressure evolution of \partial^{2}R/\partial T^{2} shown in Fig. 3(a). The merged AFM transition temperature T_{N} falls monotonically with increasing pressure up to 18.6 GPa [Figs. 2(c) and 3(b)]. This merging and the pressure dependence of two antiferromagnetic transitions are similar to that reported for CeIrGe [12]. At 20.5 GPa, we found a resistive drop at \sim1 K [inset of Fig. 2(c)]. To investigate the new resistive drop, we carried out a new experimental run [Fig. 2(d)]. It is seen that, at 19.6 GPa where T_{N} = 3.6 K [as indicated by the arrow in the inset of Fig. 2(d)], there is a pronounced drop in resistance at \sim1.1 K. This resistance drop is largest at 21.5 GPa, where the resistance declines by \sim76.6%, and then the drop becomes smaller upon further compression [Fig. 2(d)]. This observation is confirmed in a separate measurement in which a pressure-induced resistance drop is \sim92.8% at 22.0 GPa, as shown in Fig. 2(f). To explore the origin of this resistance drop, we applied a magnetic field to CeRhGe_{3} subjected to 21.5 GPa and cooled the high-pressure cell to 40 mK. As shown in Fig. 2(e) the onset temperature of the resistance drop shifts to a lower temperature upon increasing magnetic field. Furthermore, ac susceptibility measured at 20.1 GPa [the inset of Fig. 2(e)] becomes diamagnetic at \sim1.2 K. All these measurements show that the pressure-induced resistance drop in low temperatures results from a superconducting transition.

To know the superconducting volume in our sample, we used the same high-pressure cell and the gasket to perform the susceptibility measurement on lead (Pb) which is considered to have 100% superconducting volume. It is found that the voltage drop from Pb in the pickup coil is about 28 mV. Consequently, we can estimate the superconducting volume of our sample that is subjected to 20.1 GPa and its superconductivity coexists with AFM order to be about 11%. Based on these results, we propose that the superconductivity at 20.1 GPa is likely a filamentarylike superconductivity, in good agreement with a body of evidence in correlated electron materials that filamentarylike superconductivity develops above the bulk superconducting transition when antiferromagnetic order is present and that the resistive T_{C} nearly coincides with the bulk T_{C} once evidence

  for magnetic order is absent [31,32]. Note that the resistance below the onset temperature is still finite which is possibly due to the presence of sample microcracks generated by the quasihydrostatic pressure environment.

We extract the field dependence of T_{C} for CeRhGe_{3} at 21.5 GPa [Fig. 2(e)] and display it in Fig. 4. We did a linear fit for the magnetic dependence of T_{C} (as shown by the dashed line in Fig. 4). The rate of decrease of the onset temperature is very high (-11.6 T/K), a huge value that a characteristic of the weak temperature dependence of the magnetic field of pressure-induced superconductivity in other CeTX_{3} compounds [5]. Extrapolation of the linear fit to zero temperature yields upper critical pressure about 15 T at 21.5 GPa.

This pressure-induced superconductivity emerges in the noncentrosymmetric _14mm_ crystal structure. Results of synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements on CeRhGe_{3} at pressures up to 28.5 GPa are summarized in Fig. 5. With increasing pressure, the lattice constants decrease, but the crystal structure remains unchanged. A fit of the pressure-dependent cell volume to a Murnaghan equation of state (V=V_{0}[1+P(B^{\prime}/B)]^{-1/B^{\prime}}) gives a bulk modulus (B) and its pressure derivative (B^{\prime}) of 115 GPa and 5, respectively. Here B is the isothermal bulk modulus at zero pressure, B^{\prime} is the pressure derivative of B evaluated at zero pressure, and V and V_{0} are the high-pressure volume and zero-pressure volume of the material, respectively. The stability of the structure against pressure rules out the possibility that the superconductivity emerges in a different crystal structure at low temperatures. This is consistent with the observation of the huge \thetaH_{C2}/\thetaT of CeRhGe_{3} which is a common feature of these noncentrosymmetric superconductors.

Figure 6 shows the pressure-temperature phase diagram obtained from our measurements. The overall bell-shaped response of antiferromagnetism to applied pressure is captured in Doniach's model of competing Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) and Kondo interactions [33]. With increasing pressure, the Kondo hybridization becomes dominant, which suppresses the RKKY-mediated long-range order. However, T_{N} does not go continuously to zero temperature. A similar pressure dependence of the AFM transition temperature is also found in CeIrGe_{3}[12]. Nevertheless, the substantially suppressed Neel order around 20 GPa leaves the possibility that magnetic fluctuations could play a role in inducing superconductivity that initially coexists with antiferromagnetic order.

In Fig. 7(a) we place our discovery of superconductivity in CeRhGe_{3} in the context of early results on other members of the CeTX_{3} family [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18] and compare the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature for the whole CeTX_{3} family. We find that the critical pressure P_{\rm crit} at which pressure-induced superconductivity reaches a maximum T_{C} is strongly correlated with the unit-cell volume at the ambient pressure [Fig. 7(a)]. For X= Si or Ge, the cell volume increases in the sequence T= Co, Rh, Ir, and for a given T, the cell volume is larger for X= Ge. CeCoSi_{3}, with the smallest cell volume, has a mixed-valence 4 f configuration reflecting strong hybridization between f and conduction (c) electrons and is not superconducting above 0.5 K [34]. In contrast, the Kondo hybridization in the large-cell compounds, CeIrGe_{3} and CeRhGe_{3}, is much weaker [4]. As the unit cell expands, the critical pressure P_{\rm crit} increases by an order of magnitude from CeRhSi_{3} to CeIrGe_{3}. This correlation implies that an optimally large hybridization and, thus, an optimally strong Kondo coupling induced by compression are required for superconductivity.

Assuming that our equation of state for CeRhGe_{3} provides a reasonable approximation for estimating the cell volume

Residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of our sample is about 13, similar to the result (RRR = 15) reported in Ref. [7]. (b) The temperature dependence of resistance at pressures from 1.1 to 13.7 GPa. The pressures are 1.1, 2.2, 3.4, 4.2, 5.4, 6.3, 7.6, 8.5, 9.3, 10.4, 11.4, 12.7, and 13.7 GPa from the bottom to the top. The inset displays evidence for two antiferromagnetic transition temperatures, T_{N1} and T_{N2} (as indicated by arrows), for P=1.1 GPa that merge together at 13.7 GPa (as indicated by orange arrow).

(d) The temperature dependence of resistance obtained in the pressure range of 19.6–26.5 GPa. The inset is an enlarged view of the resistance in the lower-temperature regime.

  of other Ce_T_X_3 members at P_{\rm crit}, we plot in Fig. 7(b) the maximum superconducting transition temperature T_{C}^{\rm max} as a function of critical cell volume V_{\rm crit} at P_{\rm crit}. Interestingly, all T_{C}^{\rm max} fall within a rather narrow range of V_{\rm crit} values that vary by only \pm 1.7\%, as emphasized by the vertical dashed lines in Fig. 7(a). It appears, then, that there is an approximate optimal cell volume for achieving a maximum T_{C}. Because all the family members are nominally isoelectronic, this correlation could be interpreted as reflecting an optimal hybridization or Kondo coupling for a maximum T_{C}. Further, as shown by dashed lines in Fig. 7(a), V_{\rm crit}, and by inference a critical hybridization or Kondo coupling strength, places optimal superconductivity near the crossover to a mixed-valence regime found in CeCoSi_{3}. This raises the possibility that critical valence fluctuations also might play a role in producing superconductivity in the Ce_T_X_3 series, with CeCoSi_{3} being too far into the mixed-valence regime for those fluctuations to be effective.

Perhaps the most interesting correlation is that T_{C}^{\rm max} increases systematically as the T element changes from 3d to 4d

  to 5d, and for T= Rh and Ir, T_{C}^{\max} is similar irrespective of the X element. With a fixed angular momentum of the T elements, the atomic spin-orbit interaction strength, which gives rise to a Rashba antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling [6], is proportional to Z^{4}/n^{3}, where Z is the atomic number and n is the principal quantum number. Normalizing this ratio to 1 for T= Co, then the atomic spin-orbit coupling is \sim3 and \sim14 times stronger for T= Rh and Ir, respectively. The observation that T_{C}^{\max} is comparable for T= Rh and Ir irrespective of X suggests that spin-orbit coupling of the X elements may not play such an important role, and, indeed, X elements tend to act as "inert" spacers. As an aside, we note that of all the members, CeCoGe_{3} is the only one with a magnetic easy plane, as opposed to others with an easy axis [7], and CeCoSi_{3} is strongly hybridized. The clear correlation in Fig. 7(b) is that T_{C}^{\max} increases with increasing spin-orbit coupling strength.

The role of antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling is to lift spin degeneracy of single-particle states, removing parity symmetry and creating spin-split electronic bands in which spins are polarized tangential to the electrons' momentum. In general, band splitting due to antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling is band dependent, and an effective antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling is expected to depend on the extent of hybridization between f and conduction electrons [35]. Though a correlation between T_{C}^{\max} and magnitude of the atomic spin-orbit coupling is obvious in Fig. 7(b), the correlation is not 1:1 because f-c hybridization, and hence effective antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling, varies with the T element. From results in Fig. 7, we conclude, then, that spin-orbit coupling is a key factor in determining the maximum value of T_{C} in the CeTX_{3} family and that a narrow range of cell volumes, i.e., hybridization, is necessary for inducing a superconducting state.

## IV Conclusion

We have discovered superconductivity in heavy-fermion CeRhGe_{3}, the last nonsuperconducting member of the CeTX_{3} family. This discovery has allowed an alternative perspective on conditions necessary for superconductivity in the family and for the maximum T_{C} that its members reach. It is not possible from our studies to make definitive statements about the pairing mechanism or symmetry of the superconducting pairs, but it seems that magnetic as well as valence fluctuations could be effective in Cooper pairing and that, with higher maximum T_{C}'s in the sequence X=3d, 4d to 5d, spin-orbit coupling plays a progressively dominant role in determining the gap symmetry. Clearly, this work calls for new experiments to determine the evolution of the relative admixture of spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing across the series, to search for evidence of valence and magnetic fluctuations in the vicinity of V_{\rm crit}, and for theory that explicitly considers antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling, not only for its effect on the pairing symmetry but also as an initial condition for superconductivity in CeTX_{3} materials and in noncentrosymmetric compounds more broadly.

We assume this same relationship to estimate V_{\rm crit} for other family members.

###### Abstract

We report the discovery of superconductivity in pressurized CeRhGe_{3}, a nonsuperconducting member of the isostructural family of noncentrosymmetric heavy-fermion compounds CeT\,X_{3} (T= Co, Rh, Ir and X= Si, Ge). Superconductivity appears in CeRhGe_{3} at a pressure of 19.6 GPa and the transition temperature T_{C} reaches a maximum value of 1.3 K at 21.5 GPa. This finding provides an opportunity to establish systematic correlations between superconductivity and material properties within this family. Though ambient-pressure unit-cell volumes and critical pressures for superconductivity vary substantially across the series, all family members reach a maximum T_{C}^{\rm max} at a common (\pm1.7%) critical cell volume V_{\rm crit}, and T_{C}^{\rm max} at V_{\rm crit} increases with increasing spin-orbit coupling strength of the d electrons. These correlations show that substantial Kondo and spin-orbit couplings favor superconductivity in this family, the latter reflecting the role of broken centrosymmetry.

## I Introduction

The discovery of the first heavy-fermion superconductor CeCu_{2}Si_{2} in 1979 [1] opened the new field of unconventional superconductivity and posed a fundamental challenge for understanding the superconducting mechanism. After nearly 40 years, more than 40 heavy-fermion superconductors have been found, and there is growing appreciation that their superconductivity emerges at the border of competing or coexisting electronic orders [2], suggesting that fluctuations of these orders may be the source of superconductivity. Among heavy-fermion compounds, the CeT\,X_{3} (T= Co, Ir, Rh and X= Si, Ge) [3, 4] family belongs to a subset whose crystallographic structure (I4mm) lacks a center of inversion symmetry [5, 6]. Except for the mixed-valence member CeCoSi_{3}, others of the family order antiferromagnetically at atmospheric pressure. Application of pressure to CeRhSi_{3}, CeIrSi_{3}, and CeCoGe_{3}, CeIrGe_{3} suppresses their Neel temperature toward zero temperature where a dome of superconductivity emerges [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. These observations have led to suggestions that magnetic fluctuations may induce unconventional superconductivity, but this remains unsettled, in part because of the possible nontrivial role of antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling that is a consequence of these materials' noncentrosymmetry [6]. Besides its possible role in forming superconductivity, sufficiently strong spin-orbit coupling would also lead to an unusual pairing state that is a mixture of spin-singlet and spin-triplet components.

As a member of the magnetic CeT\,X_{3} family, CeRhGe_{3} is expected to become superconducting under pressure. However, experiments to about 8 GPa find only a monotonic increase in its Neel temperature [15]. Here, we report an observation of pressure-induced superconductivity in CeRhGe_{3}. As will be discussed, this discovery allows a broader perspective on conditions favoring superconductivity in this family of nominally isoelectronic compounds.

## II Experimental Details

Single crystals of CeRhGe_{3} were grown from a Rh_{0.25}Ge_{0.75} eutectic self-flux (T_{\rm melt}=850\,^{\circ}C) [19, 20]. The elements Ce, Rh, Ge were are melted together in a molar ratio of Ce : Rh : Ge = 1 : 3.5 : 13.5 (corresponding to CeRhGe_{6}+10 Rh_{0.25}Ge_{0.75}) on a water-cooled copper hearth in an ultrahigh-purity Ar atmosphere. The arc-melted button was then placed in a 2-ml alumina crucible and sealed under vacuum in a silica tube. The tube was heated to 1150\,^{\circ}C, held at that temperature for 12 h, and then cooled slowly at 2\,^{\circ}C/h to 875\,^{\circ}C. The excess flux was removed by spinning the (inverted) silica tube in a centrifuge. Single crystals of CeRhGe_{3} in the form of three-dimensional, tetrahedral-like blocks with well-defined facets and volumes ranging from 1 to 4\,mm^{3} were obtained.

High-pressure resistance and magnetoresistance measurements were carried out in a diamond-anvil cell made of a Be-Cu alloy. Diamond anvils with 300-\mum flats were used for all high-pressure experiments. In the resistance measurements, NaCl powder was employed as the pressure-transmitting medium to obtain a quasibrostatic pressure environment, which has been widely used for high-pressure transport measurements [21]. The four-probe method determined the _ab_ plane resistance of the single-crystal sample. In our high-pressure ac susceptibility measurements, the sample is surrounded by a secondary coil (pickup coil) and a field-generating primary coil is wound on top of the secondary coil. The alternating flux through the pickup coil produces an ac voltage which is the measured signal. When the sample is cooled below T_{C}, the field is expelled from the sample due to the superconducting shielding effect, forcing some of the flux lines out of the pickup coil and leading to a reduction in the induced voltage in the pickup coil [22; 23; 24; 25]. A lock-in amplifier (SR830) is used to generate an ac magnetic field through the primary coil and to detect the drop in the induced voltage through the secondary coil. The frequency used for the \chi^{^{\prime}} data is 217 Hz, and the primary coil yields a magnetic field of 3 Oe at this frequency. The balanced secondary coils are connected with a lock-in amplifier. In order to minimize this temperature-dependent background, we used a high-pressure cell made from a Be-Cu alloy to generate pressure and a Be-Cu sheet as a gasket, because the Be-Cu alloy is a nonmagnetic material. Even so, we first measured the ac susceptibility for the high-pressure cell, without a sample but with coils and gaskets, to get the background, and then performed the ac susceptibility measurement for the sample in the same high-pressure cell. To pick up the signal from the sample carefully, we did the background subtraction.

High-pressure x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed at room temperature on beamline 15U at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility and beamline 4W2 at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Diamonds with low birefringence were selected for these XRD measurements. A monochromatic x-ray beam with a wavelength of 0.6199 A was employed and silicon oil served as a pressure-transmitting medium [26; 27; 28].

The high-pressure heat capacity of the sample under pressure was derived from ac calorimetry. Pressure is determined by the pressure dependence of T_{C} of Pb [29] that is placed together with the sample in a Teflon capsule. In this technique, a small temperature oscillation \Delta T generated by a heater glued to one face of the crystal is converted to an ac voltage signal by a chromel-AuFe (0.07%) thermocouple fixed on the opposite side and C\propto 1/T. The pressure for all measurements in a diamond-anvil cell was determined by the ruby fluorescence method [30].

## III Results and discussions

High-pressure heat capacity measurements down to 4 K reveal two anomalies that, like CeIrGe [4], are associated with antiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions (see Fig. 1). We denote the higher AFM transition as T_{N1} and the lower one by T_{N2}. These two AFM transitions at T_{N1} and T_{N2} are identified from our high-pressure resistance measurements and the minima in second derivatives of the resistivity (Figs. 2 and 3). Figure 2(a) shows temperature dependence of resistance for CeRhGe_{3} at ambient pressure, from which T_{N1} and T_{N2} can be observed (as indicated by arrows in the inset of the figure). With increasing pressure, T_{N1} and T_{N2} move to higher temperatures [Figs. 2(b) and 3(a)], consistent with the previously reported pressure dependence of T_{N1}[15]. T_{N1} reaches a maximum at 8.5 GPa and T_{N2} is maximized near 10.5 GPa. Both transitions decrease at higher pressures and merge at \sim13.7 GPa within experimental resolution. This is seen most clearly in the pressure evolution of \partial^{2}R/\partial T^{2} shown in Fig. 3(a). The merged AFM transition temperature T_{N} falls monotonically with increasing pressure up to 18.6 GPa [Figs. 2(c) and 3(b)]. This merging and the pressure dependence of two antiferromagnetic transitions are similar to that reported for CeIrGe [12]. At 20.5 GPa, we found a resistive drop at \sim1 K [inset of Fig. 2(c)]. To investigate the new resistive drop, we carried out a new experimental run [Fig. 2(d)]. It is seen that, at 19.6 GPa where T_{N} = 3.6 K [as indicated by the arrow in the inset of Fig. 2(d)], there is a pronounced drop in resistance at \sim1.1 K. This resistance drop is largest at 21.5 GPa, where the resistance declines by \sim76.6%, and then the drop becomes smaller upon further compression [Fig. 2(d)]. This observation is confirmed in a separate measurement in which a pressure-induced resistance drop is \sim92.8% at 22.0 GPa, as shown in Fig. 2(f). To explore the origin of this resistance drop, we applied a magnetic field to CeRhGe_{3} subjected to 21.5 GPa and cooled the high-pressure cell to 40 mK. As shown in Fig. 2(e) the onset temperature of the resistance drop shifts to a lower temperature upon increasing magnetic field. Furthermore, ac susceptibility measured at 20.1 GPa [the inset of Fig. 2(e)] becomes diamagnetic at \sim1.2 K. All these measurements show that the pressure-induced resistance drop in low temperatures results from a superconducting transition.

To know the superconducting volume in our sample, we used the same high-pressure cell and the gasket to perform the susceptibility measurement on lead (Pb) which is considered to have 100% superconducting volume. It is found that the voltage drop from Pb in the pickup coil is about 28 mV. Consequently, we can estimate the superconducting volume of our sample that is subjected to 20.1 GPa and its superconductivity coexists with AFM order to be about 11%. Based on these results, we propose that the superconductivity at 20.1 GPa is likely a filamentarylike superconductivity, in good agreement with a body of evidence in correlated electron materials that filamentarylike superconductivity develops above the bulk superconducting transition when antiferromagnetic order is present and that the resistive T_{C} nearly coincides with the bulk T_{C} once evidence

  for magnetic order is absent [31,32]. Note that the resistance below the onset temperature is still finite which is possibly due to the presence of sample microcracks generated by the quasihydrostatic pressure environment.

We extract the field dependence of T_{C} for CeRhGe_{3} at 21.5 GPa [Fig. 2(e)] and display it in Fig. 4. We did a linear fit for the magnetic dependence of T_{C} (as shown by the dashed line in Fig. 4). The rate of decrease of the onset temperature is very high (-11.6 T/K), a huge value that a characteristic of the weak temperature dependence of the magnetic field of pressure-induced superconductivity in other CeTX_{3} compounds [5]. Extrapolation of the linear fit to zero temperature yields upper critical pressure about 15 T at 21.5 GPa.

This pressure-induced superconductivity emerges in the noncentrosymmetric _14mm_ crystal structure. Results of synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements on CeRhGe_{3} at pressures up to 28.5 GPa are summarized in Fig. 5. With increasing pressure, the lattice constants decrease, but the crystal structure remains unchanged. A fit of the pressure-dependent cell volume to a Murnaghan equation of state (V=V_{0}[1+P(B^{\prime}/B)]^{-1/B^{\prime}}) gives a bulk modulus (B) and its pressure derivative (B^{\prime}) of 115 GPa and 5, respectively. Here B is the isothermal bulk modulus at zero pressure, B^{\prime} is the pressure derivative of B evaluated at zero pressure, and V and V_{0} are the high-pressure volume and zero-pressure volume of the material, respectively. The stability of the structure against pressure rules out the possibility that the superconductivity emerges in a different crystal structure at low temperatures. This is consistent with the observation of the huge \thetaH_{C2}/\thetaT of CeRhGe_{3} which is a common feature of these noncentrosymmetric superconductors.

Figure 6 shows the pressure-temperature phase diagram obtained from our measurements. The overall bell-shaped response of antiferromagnetism to applied pressure is captured in Doniach's model of competing Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) and Kondo interactions [33]. With increasing pressure, the Kondo hybridization becomes dominant, which suppresses the RKKY-mediated long-range order. However, T_{N} does not go continuously to zero temperature. A similar pressure dependence of the AFM transition temperature is also found in CeIrGe_{3}[12]. Nevertheless, the substantially suppressed Neel order around 20 GPa leaves the possibility that magnetic fluctuations could play a role in inducing superconductivity that initially coexists with antiferromagnetic order.

In Fig. 7(a) we place our discovery of superconductivity in CeRhGe_{3} in the context of early results on other members of the CeTX_{3} family [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18] and compare the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature for the whole CeTX_{3} family. We find that the critical pressure P_{\rm crit} at which pressure-induced superconductivity reaches a maximum T_{C} is strongly correlated with the unit-cell volume at the ambient pressure [Fig. 7(a)]. For X= Si or Ge, the cell volume increases in the sequence T= Co, Rh, Ir, and for a given T, the cell volume is larger for X= Ge. CeCoSi_{3}, with the smallest cell volume, has a mixed-valence 4 f configuration reflecting strong hybridization between f and conduction (c) electrons and is not superconducting above 0.5 K [34]. In contrast, the Kondo hybridization in the large-cell compounds, CeIrGe_{3} and CeRhGe_{3}, is much weaker [4]. As the unit cell expands, the critical pressure P_{\rm crit} increases by an order of magnitude from CeRhSi_{3} to CeIrGe_{3}. This correlation implies that an optimally large hybridization and, thus, an optimally strong Kondo coupling induced by compression are required for superconductivity.

Assuming that our equation of state for CeRhGe_{3} provides a reasonable approximation for estimating the cell volume

Residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of our sample is about 13, similar to the result (RRR = 15) reported in Ref. [7]. (b) The temperature dependence of resistance at pressures from 1.1 to 13.7 GPa. The pressures are 1.1, 2.2, 3.4, 4.2, 5.4, 6.3, 7.6, 8.5, 9.3, 10.4, 11.4, 12.7, and 13.7 GPa from the bottom to the top. The inset displays evidence for two antiferromagnetic transition temperatures, T_{N1} and T_{N2} (as indicated by arrows), for P=1.1 GPa that merge together at 13.7 GPa (as indicated by orange arrow).

(d) The temperature dependence of resistance obtained in the pressure range of 19.6–26.5 GPa. The inset is an enlarged view of the resistance in the lower-temperature regime. As discussed in the text, the pronounced drop in resistance at low temperatures reflects a pressure-induced superconducting transition. (e) The temperature dependence of the normalized resistance measured at 21.5 GPa under different magnetic fields. The arrows indicate the onset temperature of the superconducting transition. The inset displays the real part of ac susceptibility measured at 20.1 GPa. (f) The resistance versus temperature measured in another run where the resistance drop at T_{C} is more pronounced.

  of other Ce_T_X_3 members at P_{\rm crit}, we plot in Fig. 7(b) the maximum superconducting transition temperature T_{C}^{\rm max} as a function of critical cell volume V_{\rm crit} at P_{\rm crit}. Interestingly, all T_{C}^{\rm max} fall within a rather narrow range of V_{\rm crit} values that vary by only \pm 1.7\%, as emphasized by the vertical dashed lines in Fig. 7(a). It appears, then, that there is an approximate optimal cell volume for achieving a maximum T_{C}. Because all the family members are nominally isoelectronic, this correlation could be interpreted as reflecting an optimal hybridization or Kondo coupling for a maximum T_{C}. Further, as shown by dashed lines in Fig. 7(a), V_{\rm crit}, and by inference a critical hybridization or Kondo coupling strength, places optimal superconductivity near the crossover to a mixed-valence regime found in CeCoSi_{3}. This raises the possibility that critical valence fluctuations also might play a role in producing superconductivity in the Ce_T_X_3 series, with CeCoSi_{3} being too far into the mixed-valence regime for those fluctuations to be effective.

Perhaps the most interesting correlation is that T_{C}^{\rm max} increases systematically as the T element changes from 3d to 4d

  to 5d, and for T= Rh and Ir, T_{C}^{\max} is similar irrespective of the X element. With a fixed angular momentum of the T elements, the atomic spin-orbit interaction strength, which gives rise to a Rashba antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling [6], is proportional to Z^{4}/n^{3}, where Z is the atomic number and n is the principal quantum number. Normalizing this ratio to 1 for T= Co, then the atomic spin-orbit coupling is \sim3 and \sim14 times stronger for T= Rh and Ir, respectively. The observation that T_{C}^{\max} is comparable for T= Rh and Ir irrespective of X suggests that spin-orbit coupling of the X elements may not play such an important role, and, indeed, X elements tend to act as "inert" spacers. As an aside, we note that of all the members, CeCoGe_{3} is the only one with a magnetic easy plane, as opposed to others with an easy axis [7], and CeCoSi_{3} is strongly hybridized. The clear correlation in Fig. 7(b) is that T_{C}^{\max} increases with increasing spin-orbit coupling strength.

The role of antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling is to lift spin degeneracy of single-particle states, removing parity symmetry and creating spin-split electronic bands in which spins are polarized tangential to the electrons' momentum. In general, band splitting due to antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling is band dependent, and an effective antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling is expected to depend on the extent of hybridization between f and conduction electrons [35]. Though a correlation between T_{C}^{\max} and magnitude of the atomic spin-orbit coupling is obvious in Fig. 7(b), the correlation is not 1:1 because f-c hybridization, and hence effective antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling, varies with the T element. From results in Fig. 7, we conclude, then, that spin-orbit coupling is a key factor in determining the maximum value of T_{C} in the CeTX_{3} family and that a narrow range of cell volumes, i.e., hybridization, is necessary for inducing a superconducting state.

## IV Conclusion

We have discovered superconductivity in heavy-fermion CeRhGe_{3}, the last nonsuperconducting member of the CeTX_{3} family. This discovery has allowed an alternative perspective on conditions necessary for superconductivity in the family and for the maximum T_{C} that its members reach. It is not possible from our studies to make definitive statements about the pairing mechanism or symmetry of the superconducting pairs, but it seems that magnetic as well as valence fluctuations could be effective in Cooper pairing and that, with higher maximum T_{C}'s in the sequence X=3d, 4d to 5d, spin-orbit coupling plays a progressively dominant role in determining the gap symmetry. Clearly, this work calls for new experiments to determine the evolution of the relative admixture of spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing across the series, to search for evidence of valence and magnetic fluctuations in the vicinity of V_{\rm crit}, and for theory that explicitly considers antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling, not only for its effect on the pairing symmetry but also as an initial condition for superconductivity in CeTX_{3} materials and in noncentrosymmetric compounds more broadly.

We assume this same relationship to estimate V_{\rm crit} for other family members.
