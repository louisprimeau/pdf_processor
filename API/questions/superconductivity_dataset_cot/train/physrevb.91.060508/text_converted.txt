###### Abstract

We report a high-pressure study of simultaneous low-temperature
electrical resistivity and Hall effect measurements on high quality
single-crystalline KFe₂As₂ using designer diamond anvil cell techniques
with applied pressures up to 33 GPa. In the low-pressure regime, we show
that the superconducting transition temperature T_(c) finds a maximum
onset value of 7 K near 2 GPa, in contrast to previous reports that find
a minimum T_(c) and reversal of pressure dependence at this pressure.
Upon applying higher pressures, this T_(c) is diminished until a sudden
drastic enhancement occurs coincident with a first-order structural
phase transition into a collapsed tetragonal phase. The appearance of a
distinct superconducting phase above 13 GPa is also accompanied by a
sudden reversal of dominant charge carrier sign, from hole- to
electron-like, which agrees with our band structure calculations
predicting the emergence of an electron pocket and diminishment of hole
pockets upon Fermi surface reconstruction. Our results suggest the
high-temperature superconducting phase in KFe₂As₂ is substantially
enhanced by the presence of nested electron and hole pockets, providing
the key ingredient of high-T_(c) superconductivity in iron pnictide
superconductors.

2015 16 January 2015 16 January 2015 16 January 2015 7 February 2015 16
January 2015 linearized augmented plane wave method in the local density
approximation. The k-point mesh was taken to be 11 × 11 × 11.

As shown in Fig. 1, electrical resistivity measurements were performed
on the same sample at different pressures using a four-wire
configuration. [Resistance rather than resistivity values are reported
due to a possible contamination from highly anisotropic c-axis
conductance of the sample in the DAC; this is not the case in ambient
pressure data; cf. Fig. 1(b).] At low pressures (i.e., P < 15 GPa),
these measurements reveal a surprising enhancement of T_(c) that is
quite different from previous reports [12, 13, 16, 17, 18]. At ambient
pressure, the zero-resistance state of KFe₂As₂ is observed at 3.6 K,
followed by metallic behavior in the resistivity as shown in Fig. 1(b).
On applying pressure at our lowest value of 3.1 GPa, the transition
temperature determined by zero resistance shows a sudden jump up to 6 K,
followed by a gradual reduction with increasing pressures up to 9.7 GPa
that points to a complete termination of the superconducting phase near
∼15 GPa. However, at 14.4 GPa we observe a sizable reduction of
resistivity below 11 K that is strongly suppressed by applying magnetic
field [see Fig. 1(c)], suggestive of a SC transition. Upon further
pressure increase, the SC transition is gradually reduced, being
completely suppressed to zero temperature near 26 GPa.

We depict the pressure phase diagram of KFe₂As₂ with two SC phases in
Fig. 2, defining T_(c) from the zero resistance (circles) and onset of
the resistive transition (squares). For comparison, we also plot T_(c)
from Tafti _et al._[12], showing the sudden reversal in pressure
dependence of T_(c) previously reported. In the current work, we observe
a peak in the low-pressure SC phase (SC1) that appears at the previously
reported critical pressure P_(c), rather than a minimum as observed in
other studies [12, 13, 16, 17, 18]. The enhancement (rather than
suppression) of T_(c) in SC1 can be possibly explained by the reduction
in hydrostatic pressure conditions produced by the steatite powder in
our DAC experiment, as compared to the previous clamp-cell experiments.
While the level of hydrostaticity at low pressures is generally
considered good in this configuration, the sensitivity of T_(c) in
KFe₂As₂ to uniaxial components may be susceptible to such differences
and may explain the variation of T_(c) values reported at low pressures
[12, 13, 16, 17, 18].

We can estimate the slope of T_(c) as a function of uniaxial pressure by
using the thermodynamic relation for the second-order transition, or the
Ehrenfest relation [25, 26],

dT_(c)/dP₀₀₁ = V_(m)Δα₀₀₁T_(c)/ΔC_(p),
(1)

where V_(m) is the molar volume (6.1 × 10⁻⁵ m³), Δα₀₀₁ is the jump in
the thermal expansion coefficient along c axis at the phase transition,
and ΔC_(p) is the jump in the heat capacity. Using the experimental
data, Δα₀₀₁ = 1.8 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹ and ΔC_(p)/T_(c) = 54 mJ/mol K² obtained
from Ref. [27], we extract a positive pressure derivative,
dT_(c)/dP₀₀₁ = 2.1 K/GPa, drawn as a dashed line in Fig. 2.
Surprisingly, the calculated T_(c)(P) dependence crosses the linear
extrapolation of our measured

The superconducting transition temperature T_(c) of SC1 phase (solid
circles) is determined from the zero resistance state, and T_(c)^(onset)
(filled squares) in the high-pressure SC2 phase determined from the
onset of resistive transition for samples no. 1 and no. 2 (open symbols)
in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively. The critical pressure P_(c) is
defined as the pressure where the sign reversal of T_(c) (triangles) in
the low-pressure phase dependence has been observed previously [12]. The
second superconducting phase SC2 appears above a structural collapse of
the tetragonal unit cell at 13 GPa (see text). Blue dotted line is the
pressure derivative of T_(c) obtained from the Ehrenfest relation (see
text).

SC1 T_(c) data very close to P_(c). The observation of a maximum at
P_(c), rather than a minimum, suggests that, if there is a SC order
parameter symmetry change, then it must be first order in nature.
Alternatively, a crossover is occurring without symmetry change, or
P_(c) is correlated with the recent photoemission study revealing the
presence of a van Hove singularity [28].

Accompanied by the large enhancement of T_(c) in SC2, the charge
transport in the normal state drastically changes around a critical
pressure P_(cT), as shown by the plateau in residual resistance R₀ shown
in Fig. 3(a). Note that the drastic increase of R₀ is not due to a
reduction of cross section with pressure, but to the pressure response
of c-axis component in the measured resistance. In contrast to the
previous work reporting the gradual decrease of in-plane resistivity
with pressure [18], a threefold increase in R₀ between 3 and 9 GPa is
observed, inconsistent with the estimated increase of R₀ by 10

Structural parameters under pressure reveal the prominent phase
transition between the normal state in SC1 and SC2. At room temperature,
we observe an abrupt enhancement of the lattice parameter a and a sudden
reduction of c at 16 GPa without any crystallographic symmetry change,
as extracted from x-ray diffraction data under pressure [Fig. 3(c)].
Combined with no crystallographic symmetry change, the reduction of c/a
in the inset of Fig. 3(c) indicates the presence of a transition from
tetragonal to cT phase at 16 GPa and 300 K, similar to the observation
in other 122 systems [29, 30, 31, 32]. Although this collapsed
transition induces the observed change in the transport properties, it
does not cause the sizable enhancement of coupling between electrons and
lattice, which could drive the observed high-T_(c) phase in SC2. To
investigate the lattice properties, we can extract the bulk modulus R₀
at zero pressure and its pressure derivative R₀^(′) from the pressure
dependence of unit cell volume (not shown) by using the third-order
Birch-Muraghan equation of state [33],

$$P = \frac{3B_{0}}{2}\big{[}\big{(}V/V_{0}\big{)}^{-\frac{1}{2}}- \big{(}V/V_{0}\big{)}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\big{]}$$
(2)
$$\times\bigg{[}1+\frac{3(B_{0}^{\prime}-4)}{4}\big{(}\big{(}V/V_{ 0}\big{)}^{-\frac{1}{2}}-1\big{)}\bigg{]},$$

where V₀ is the unit cell volume at ambient pressure. Fixing B₀^(′) = 4
in both the tetragonal and cT phases, we obtain parameters of B₀ = 40.1
GPa for the tetragonal phase, and B₀ = 50.7 GPa for the cT phase. The
increase of B₀ is rather small, compared with the large enhancement of
B₀ observed in other iron pnictides undergoing a cT transition [31]. It
is likely that the slight increase of B₀ in the cT phase with the higher
T_(c) excludes the simple phonon-mediated weak-coupling
superconductivity in SC2 as well as SC1.

Electronic structure calculations suggest that the dramatic change of
transport properties observed in the cT phase

originates from a reconstruction of electronic structure. The schematic
band structures of KFe₂As₂ in the tetragonal (0 GPa) and cT (20 GPa)
phases obtained from our calculations are shown in Fig. 4. We use the
experimental structural parameters for the tetragonal and cT phases,
comparing the theoretically optimized arsenic height $z_{\rm opt}=0.366$
in the cT phase [Fig. 4(b)] to a preliminary measurement of the
experimental value $z_{\rm exp}=0.386$ in the cT phase [Fig. 4(c)].
These give qualitatively similar band structures, with notable
enhancement of electron cylindrical pockets centered around the Γ point.
In the tetragonal phase, the Fermi surfaces consist of large hole bands
around the Γ point and a small hole pocket around the X point in the
Brillouin zone. In contrast, in the cT phase the hole bands around Γ
point shrink, becoming more three dimensional in the band. The hole
pocket around the X point vanishes, and instead a cylindrical electron
band appears. Note that the hole bands completely disappear around the Γ
point in the collapsed phase observed in other 122 systems [34, 35]. The
appearance of electron bands induced by the collapsed transition support
the switch of dominant carrier type observed in our experiment.

Besides the dominant carrier change, the appearance of an electron band
gives new insight into the possible SC pairing scenario of KFe₂As₂ in
SC2, namely, that associated with the interband coupling between hole
and electron pockets. Provided the same pairing mechanism in SC1 and
SC2, we can naively attribute the higher T_(c) in SC2 to the enhancement
of the density of states (DOS). However, as shown in Fig. 4(c), the
calculated DOS at the Fermi energy diminishes the collapsed phase.
Rather, this reduction of DOS in SC2 implies an enhancement of pairing
interaction to explain the enhancement of T_(c). Superconducting pairing
in iron pnictides with higher T_(c) values, such as in (Ba,K)Fe₂As₂, is
believed to arise from interband coupling between hole and electron
pockets, connected to each other by Fermi surface nesting [1, 36]. In
this case, in the presence of both hole and electron bands in SC2 of
KFe₂As₂, the pairing interaction associated with the nesting between
those bands could be enhanced, compared with the interaction in SC1
without electron pockets in the band structure. Such a pairing scenario
is also supported by the fact there is no bulk SC phase in the collapsed
phase of CaFe₂As₂ realized under pressure, where the disappearance of
hole pockets at Γ point has been confirmed [34, 35].

In summary, we have investigated the transport and structural properties
of KFe₂As₂ under pressures up to 33 GPa, revealing the presence of two
superconducting phases that appear distinct, but each showing strong
enhancements in their transition temperature as a function of pressure.
The first low-pressure phase exhibits a T_(c) enhancement that is
possibly connected to a strong sensitivity to uniaxial pressure
components, while the second, higher-T_(c) phase abruptly appears upon
collapse of the tetragonal structure at higher pressures. This strong
enhancement of T_(c) is accompanied by a change in the dominant charge
carrier sign induced by the structural collapse, and is explained by
electronic structure modifications that yield coexistent electron and
hole pockets with coupling that appears to favor high-temperature
superconductivity.
