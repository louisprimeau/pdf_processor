###### Abstract

By using a hydrostatic pressure, we have successfully tuned the normal
state property and superconductivity in LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiSe₂ single
crystals. It is found that, with the increase of pressure, the original
superconducting phase with T_(c) ∼ 3.5 K can be tuned to a state with
lower T_(c), and then a new superconducting phase with T_(c) ∼ 6.5 K
emerges. Accompanied by this crossover, the normal state is switched
from that with a low temperature resistivity upturning to a metallic
one. Accordingly, the normal state resistivity also shows a nonmonotonic
change with the external pressure. Furthermore, by applying a magnetic
field, the new superconducting state under pressure with T_(c) ∼ 6.5 K
is suppressed, and the recovered normal state reveals a
resistivity-upturning feature again. These results illustrate a
nontrivial relationship between the normal state property and
superconductivity in this newly discovered superconducting system.

## I Introduction

According to the theory of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS),
superconductivity is achieved by the quantum condensation of Cooper
pairs which are formed by the electrons with opposite momentum near the
Fermi surface. The ground state when superconductivity is removed is
thus naturally believed to be metallic. In some unconventional
superconductors, such as cuprate, iron pnictide/chalcogenide, heavy
fermion, and organic superconductors, this may not be true. Recently,
the BiS₂-based superconductors whose structures are similar to the
cuprates [1] and iron pnictides [2] have been discovered and formed a
new superconducting (SC) family. Many new SC compounds with the BiS₂
layer have been found, including Bi₄O₄S₃[3, 4, 5], _R_O_(1 − x)F_(x)BiS₂
(_R_ = La, Nd, Ce, Pr, and Yb) [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
Sr_(1 − x)La_(x)FBiS₂[11], and La_(1 − x)M_(x)OBiS₂ (_M_ = Ti, Zr, Hf,
and Th) [12], etc. Among these compounds, the high pressure synthesized
LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ was reported to have an optimal T_(c) ∼ 10.6 K [6].
The basic band structure obtained by first principle calculations
indicates the presence of strong Fermi surface nesting at the wave
vector (π,π) [13, 14, 15] when the doping is close to x = 0.5 in, for
example, LaO_(1 − x)F_(x)BiS₂. Quite often the superconductivity is
accompanied by a normal state with a clear semiconductinglike behavior
with unknown reasons [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In addition, possible
triplet paring and weak topological superconductivity were suggested
based on renormalization-group numerical calculation [16], but this
mechanism is still much debated. Moreover, the experiments on the
NdO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ single crystals also reveal interesting discoveries
concerning the SC mechanisms in this new system [17, 18, 19, 20, 21].

Through adjusting the lattice parameters and intimately the electronic
band structure, high pressure has served as a very effective method,
which can tune both the SC and normal state of superconductors. In this
newly found BiS₂ family, high pressure has been recognized as an
important tool to enhance both the superconductivity volume and
transition temperatures except for Bi₄O₄S₃[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28].
In particular, the SC transition temperature of _R_O_(1 − x)F_(x)BiS₂
(_R_ = La, Ce, Nd, Pr) [22, 23, 24] and Sr_(1 − x)R_(x)FBiS₂ (_R_ = La,
Ce, Nd, Pr, Sm) [25, 28] systems was enhanced tremendously by applying
the hydrostatic pressure. Taking LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ as an example, the
T_(c) of the sample can be increased from about 2 K under ambient
pressure to ∼10 K under 2 GPa [22]. And in the Sr_(1 − x)R_(x)FBiS₂ (_R_
= Ce, Nd, Pr, Sm) system, the non-SC sample at ambient pressure can also
be tuned to become a SC one with T_(c) ∼ 10 K under a pressure of 2.5
GPa [28]. To understand the role of high pressure, x-ray diffraction
measurements under pressures have been performed on LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂
system and suggest a structural phase transition from a tetragonal phase
(_P_4/_n_mm_) to a monoclinic phase (_P_21/_n_m_) under pressures [27].
Very recently, a new superconductor LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiSe₂ with the same
structure as LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ was discovered with T_(c) ∼ 3.5 K [29,
30, 31]. It was reported that the electronic structure and Fermi surface
in these two compounds are quite similar [32]. Since the system now is
selenium based, it is highly desired to do investigations on BiSe₂-based
materials, better in the form of single crystals. Furthermore, we are
curious to know how the high pressure influences the superconductivity
and the ground state property in the BiSe₂-based superconductors.

Here, we report the successful growth of the LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiSe₂
single crystals, and a systematic high-pressure study on two single
crystals (hereafter named sample 1 and sample 2). By increasing
pressure, the ground state is switched from a state with a low
temperature resistivity upturning to a metallic one; simultaneously the
original SC T_(c) ∼ 3.5 K (at ambient pressure) initially drops down to
about 2 K and finally increases with pressure. As the pressure reaches
about 1.2 ± 0.2 GPa, a new SC phase with higher T_(c) appears. At about
2.17 GPa, the T_(c) of the new SC phase reaches about 6.5 K. Accompanied
with the change of SC transition temperatures, the normal state
resistivity (ρ_(n)) decreases first and then increases with pressure.
This nonmonotonic pressure dependence of T_(c) and the normal state
resistivity in the present BiSe₂-based system are very different from
the BiS₂-based family. Furthermore, the SC phase with higher T_(c) can
be suppressed by applying a magnetic field, and a weak
resistivity-upturning feature in the normal state emerges again when
superconductivity is suppressed. All these results show the competing
feature between superconductivity and the underlying ground state
associated with the low temperature resistivity-upturning behavior.

## II Experimental Details

The LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiSe₂ single crystals were grown by using flux
method [18]. Powders of La₂O₃, LaF₃, Bi₂Se₃, Se, and La scraps (all 99.9

Measurements of resistivity under pressure were performed up to  ∼ 2.3
GPa on PPMS-16T (Quantum Design) by using HPC-33 Piston type pressure
cell with the Quantum Design dc resistivity and ac transport options.
For the resistive measurements, silver leads with a diameter of 50 μm
were glued to the LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiSe₂ single crystal with dimensions
of about 1.3 × 0.7 × 0.05 mm³ in a standard four-probe method by using
silver epoxy, and the crystal was immersed in pressure transmitting
medium (Daphne 7373) in a Teflon cap with a diameter of 4 mm.
Hydrostatic pressures were generated by a BeCu/NiCrAl clamped
piston-cylinder cell. When the pressure cell is installed to the PPMS
for measurements, the applied field is approximately parallel to _ab_
plane of the single crystal. The pressure upon the sample was calibrated
with the shift in T_(c) of a Sn sample with high purity by measuring the
temperature dependence of resistivity.

## III Results and Discussion

In Fig. 1(a) we present the x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern for the
LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiSe₂ single crystal. It’s clear that only (00/)
reflections can be observed yielding a c-axis lattice constant
c = 14.05 ± 0.03 A. The inset of Fig. 1(a) shows the Laue diffraction
pattern of the LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiSe₂ single crystal. Bright and
symmetric spots can be clearly observed, indicating a good
crystallinity. Energy dispersive x-ray spectrum (EDS) measurements were
performed at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and working distance of 10
mm by a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi Co., Ltd.). One set of the
EDS result on a nominally formulated LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiSe₂ single
crystal is shown in Fig. 1(b), and the composition of the single crystal
can be roughly expressed as LaO₇F_(0.48)Bi_(0.95)Se_(1.89) through the
EDS analysis. The atomic ratio is close to the nominal composition
except for oxygen which cannot be obtained accurately by the EDS
measurement. To clarify the precise ratio of O/F, future measurement on
electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) may be needed.

The temperature dependence of resistivity for the LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiSe₂
single crystal (sample 1) at various pressures with temperature ranging
from 2 K to 300 K is illustrated in Fig. 2(a). The inset of Fig. 2(a)
shows the temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility at ambient
pressure under a magnetic field of 10 Oe, and a sharp SC transition is
observed at about 3.5 K. An estimate on the Meissner screening volume
through the magnetic susceptibility measured in the zero-field-cooled
(ZFC) mode reveals a high superconducting volume. For sample 1, we did
not manage to measure the sample at a pressure higher than 2.04 GPa. As
shown in Fig. 2(a), at ambient pressure the normal state resistivity
shows an upturning behavior in the low temperature region. Similar
behavior was observed in sample 2. The reason for this low temperature
resistivity upturning remains puzzling, which might be induced by the
disorder effect, especially when the normal state is a bad metal.
Interestingly, this feature can be suppressed under a small pressure and
changes to a metallic one at about 0.54 GPa. With further increase of
pressure, the metallic behavior maintains until the maximum pressure.
This semiconductinglike to metallic transition with pressure has been
noticed in Sr_(1 − x)R_(x)FeBiS₂ (R = La, Ce, Nd, Pr, Sm) systems [25,
28]. In the case of Sr_(0.5)La_(0.5)FBiS₂ polycrystalline sample, the
semiconductor-metal transition was considered as coming from the change
of F-Sr/La-F bond angle along with interatomic distances [25].
Interestingly, the semiconductor-metal transition under pressure for
CeO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ system has been proposed according to the
first-principle calculations [33], but the transition was not observed
in previous

single crystal. (b) Energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis spectrum taken

reports of experiment [23, 26]. In particular, for LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂
polycrystalline samples, the normal state resistivity decreases
monotonically with increasing pressure, but it still exhibits
semiconductinglike behavior under a very high pressure (18 GPa) [27].

In Figs. 2(b) and 2(c), we present enlarged views of SC transitions at
low temperatures under various pressures for sample 1 and sample 2,
respectively. Both samples exhibit very similar behavior. Here the T_(c)
was determined by the crossing point of a linear extrapolated line of
the normal state and the transition curve, as illustrated in Fig. 2(c).
As one can see, the variation of both the SC transition temperature and
normal state resistivity upon the external pressure are nonmonotonic.
The original T_(c) ∼ 3.5 K (at ambient pressure) gradually drops down
with increasing pressure and becomes below 2 K at about 1.95 GPa. At the
same time, a high T_(c) phase gradually emerges starting from about
1.2 ± 0.2 GPa and enhances continuously with increasing pressure. It
seems that the high T_(c) phase with T_(c) = 6.5 K coexists with the low
T_(c) phase in the range from 1.2 ± 0.2 GPa to about 1.95 GPa. With
further increase of pressure, zero resistance corresponding to the high
T_(c) phase appears above 2 K and the SC transition becomes sharper at
higher pressures. A similar behavior under pressure has been observed in
some strongly correlated electronic systems, such as heavy fermion [34],
organic systems [35], and iron chalcogenides [36]. In previous high
pressure studies on BiS₂-based superconductors, the coexistence of two
transient phases is not observed clearly. This indicates the distinction
between our present BiSe₂-based superconductors and the earlier studied
BiS₂-based systems. For sample 1 we did not manage to measure the
resistivity beyond 2.04 GPa. Two samples are from the same batch. One
can see that the resistive transitions below 2.04 GPa are quite similar
to each other.

It is worth noting that the normal state resistivity presents a
nonmonotonic dependence on applied pressure. As shown in Figs. 2(b) and
2(c), the normal state resistivity just above the SC transition
temperature gradually decreases with increasing pressure until about
1.95 GPa. Surprisingly, above the threshold pressure, the normal state
resistivity begins to increase remarkably with increasing pressure. It
is clear that this qualitative behavior is closely related to the
pressure-dependent T_(c), as we will address below.

Figures 3(a) and 3(b) present the phase diagram of $T_{c}^{\rm onset}$
versus pressure and pressure-dependent resistivity (8 K), respectively.
Here, the pressure for the absence of the second transition (about 1.95
GPa) is defined as the critical one (P_(c)). In the high temperature
region, ρ(T) shows a parallel shift with pressure and a turning point at
the critical pressure P_(c) is also observed as illustrated for data
measured at 8 K in Fig. 3(b). This implies that the transition
associated with the turning point at the critical pressure P_(c) of
resistivity is an intrinsic effect. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) clearly reveal
two distinct SC phases: the low T_(c) SC phase below P_(c) and the high
T_(c) SC phase above P_(c). In the low T_(c) SC phase region, both T_(c)
and the normal state resistivity are suppressed with increasing
pressure. On the contrary, in the high T_(c) SC phase, T_(c) is slightly
enhanced and the normal state resistivity increases remarkably with
raising pressure. In LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ polycrystalline samples, a
structural phase transition from a tetragonal phase (P4/nmm) to a
monoclinic phase (P2₁/m) has been suggested by high-pressure x-ray
diffraction measurements. And a high T_(c) value of 10.7 K in the
high-pressure regime appears in the monoclinic structure [27].
Therefore, considering the very weak change of the transition
temperature of the high T_(c) phase, and taking a comparison between
LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ and LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiSe₂, we believe that there
are two distinct SC phases in our LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiSe₂ single crystals
in the intermediate pressure

region (1.2 +- 0.2 to ∼1.95 GPa). At a high pressure, all the phase
becomes superconductive with T_(c)∼ 6.5 K. The transition from the low
T_(c) phase to the high T_(c) one could be induced by the structural
transition, which needs to be further checked.

In Fig. 4(a), we present the temperature dependent resistivity under
magnetic field up to 14 T at 2.04 GPa (T_(c)∼ 6.3 K). The upper critical
field H_(c2) versus T is displayed in Fig. 4(b). We use different
criterions of 90

resistivity-upturning behavior.

## IV Conclusion

In summary, we have successfully tuned the normal state property and
superconductivity in LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiSe₂ single crystals through a
hydrostatic pressure. The ground state is switched from that with a low
temperature resistivity upturning to a metallic one with increasing
pressure. Moreover, the original SC phase with T_(c) ∼ 3.5 K can be
tuned to a new SC state with T_(c) ∼ 6.5 K. In the low T_(c) SC phase
region, both T_(c) and the normal state resistivity are suppressed with
increasing pressure. On the contrary, in the high T_(c) SC phase,
superconductivity is enhanced and the normal state resistivity increases
remarkably with increasing pressure. Moreover, the weak
resistivity-upturning behavior reemerges when the superconductivity
under a high pressure is suppressed by a high magnetic field. These
results illustrate a nontrivial relationship between the normal state
property and superconductivity. Further theoretical and detailed
structure investigations are highly desired to clarify the new high
T_(c) SC phase under a high pressure.
