###### Abstract

Powder neutron-diffraction profile refinement techniques have been used to investigate the oxygen dependence of the crystal structure and its effect on the superconducting phase transition in high-quality samples of the superconductor HgBa2CuO4+-6 (0.04 <= 6 <= 0.23). The system remains tetragonal (space group P4/_mmm_) over the full range of temperature (10-300 K) and oxygen concentration explored. The _a_-axis lattice parameter decreases smoothly with increasing d, while the _c_-axis lattice parameter exhibits a maximum. The extra oxygen in the material is found to randomly occupy the centered O(3) site (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0) in the Hg layer, and no other additional site for the extra oxygen was found in the structure. There is also no mixing of the cations on the Cu and Hg sites. T_{c} is observed to vary strongly with d, increasing from 0 K for d = 0.04 to a maximum T_{c} = 95 K at d = 0.18, and then decreasing rapidly for larger d. The relationship of T_{c}(\delta) to the rate of hole doping on the CuO2 planes indicates that this doping level is only half of that expected for O2- ions. Our structural studies reveal an interesting correlation between the occupation of the O(3) site and the movement of the Ba ions towards the O(3) and away from the Cu-O planes. The Ba layer thus becomes structurally disordered, and this disorder is found to closely mirror the T_{c}(\delta) behavior. Valence and/or distance arguments for the O(3) then suggest that this oxygen is only singly ionized.

## Introduction

The new mercury superconductors of formula HgBa2Ca -1Cu2O2 +- 6 have generated considerable interest in the superconductivity community because of the high transition temperatures associated with these compounds.1-14 In particular, the single layer (_n_ = 1) material (designated Hg1201) has the highest superconducting transition temperature of any one-layer cuprate, with T_{c} = 95 K. T_{c} is found to initially increase with the number of layers in the unit cell (analogous to the Tl and Bi series of materials), with T_{c} = 126 K for n = 2 (Hg1212) and 135 K (Hg1223) for n = 3. In addition, these transition temperatures increase with the application of pressure, saturating at 118, 154, and 164 K for n = 1,2,3, respectively.13 The fourth member (Hg1234) has also been synthesized,11 with a somewhat lower T_{c} of 126 K, while T_{c} is found to decrease to 101 K for the five Cu-layer system (Hg1245).14

All the compounds belonging to this series of materials have the same tetragonal P4/_mmm_ symmetry, with lattice parameters given approximately by a \approx 3.85 A, and c  9.5 +- 3.2(_n_ - 1) A. Their structures consist of a simple stacking of layers:

\[n = 1 : \left[ \left( \text{Hg}\text{O}_{6} \right)_{o}\left( \text{BaO} \right)_{c}\left( \text{CuO}_{2} \right)_{o}\left( \text{BaO} \right)_{c}\left[ \text{Hg}\text{O}_{6} \right)_{o}\ldots\right.\] \[n = 2 : \left[ \left( \text{Hg}\text{O}_{6} \right)_{o}\left( \text{BaO} \right)_{c}\left( \text{CuO}_{2} \right)_{o}\left( \text{Ca} \right)_{c}\left( \text{CuO}_{2} \right)_{o}\ (CuO2) layer are coplanar, or almost coplanar, with the copper atoms, in contrast to other superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7 where the (CuO2) planes are significantly buckled.

The simplest Hg material from a structural point of view is, of course, the single-layer HgBa2CuO4+-d system, and we have therefore undertaken a detailed study of the crystallography as a function of oxygen doping to elucidate the relationship between the structure and superconducting properties. The crystal structure of HgBa2CuO4+-d has already been analyzed in some detail via neutron powder diffraction by Wagner _et al._3 and by Chmaissem _et al._4 In the study by Wagner _et al._3 it was suggested that some of the Cu substitutes onto the Hg sites, with a correlation between this Cu substitution and the oxygen doping in the Hg layer. However, Chmaissem _et al._,4 as well as the present results on more phase-pure samples, show that there is no mixing of the cations within experimental error. Recent studies of the effect of oxygen doping on the T_{c} for Hg1201 suggest, though, that there may be two kinds of oxygen-doping sites in the material.15 In order to address this question as well as to clarify the relationship between the superconductivity and the crystal structure, we have prepared high-quality samples of HgBa2CuO4+-d and have used powder neutron diffraction to analyze the structure of the compounds as a function of doping d. We have not been able to identify a second oxygen site, but we have found a direct structural correlation between the doped oxygen and the Ba ions, which mirrors the behavior of T_{c}(d).

## Experimental procedures

The powder samples of HgBa2CuO4+-d were prepared for the neutron powder diffraction studies by using the solid-state reaction technique described by Meng _et al._16 The heat-treatment conditions of the specimens are listed in Table I. The sample labeled S1 was used to obtain most of the diffraction data. In each case the sample was prepared and/or heat treated to obtain a particular oxygen concentration. The sample was then characterized by both x-ray-diffraction and magnetic-susceptibility measurements. The observed onset superconducting transition temperatures are also shown in Table I; further details of the superconducting properties and measurements of these samples can be found elsewhere.15 The neutron-diffraction data were then obtained and analyzed, before the sample was further heat treated to investigate a different oxygen concentration. A second sample was prepared and annealed for the final measurement, and is designated S2.

Neutron powder-diffraction data were collected using the 32-detector high-resolution powder diffractometer located at the Research Reactor of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The Cu(311) monochromator was employed at a wavelength of 1.539(1) A. The horizontal collimations used were 15', 20', and 7' (full-width-at-half maximum) before and after the monochromator, respectively, and after the sample. A cylindrical vanadium sample holder was used to hold the powder, which was then mounted in a He refrigerator to control the temperature.

The structural refinements were carried out with the general structure analysis system (GSAS) program of Larson and Von Dreele17 using the intensity data in the 2_th_ range from 8 to 145deg. Neutron-scattering amplitudes used in the refinements were 1.266, 0.525, 0.772, and 0.581 (10-12 cm) for Hg, Ba, Cu, and O, respectively.17 All the observed peaks in the diffraction pattern were accounted for by the expected Hg1201 structure, with the exception of two whose intensities were less than 1.5% of the strongest peak. The small impurity content attests to the high quality of the samples. There was a significant amount of nuclear absorption by the Hg, and thus the values of _mR_ were determined experimentally for each sample. They ranged from 0.34-0.52, and the intensity data were then corrected for absorption in the standard way.17

The initial refinement in each case was carried out assuming the symmetry of space group P4/_mmm_ and using as starting parameters those given by Chmaissem _et al._4 The occupancy factors for the extra oxygen atoms O(3) located at \left( {\frac{1}{2}},{\frac{1}{2}},0\right) on the (HgO8) layer were refined with the other parameters, keeping the thermal factor _B_[O(3)] fixed. The value of _n_[O(3)] obtained in this calculation was 0.18 for the as-prepared sample (T_{c} = 95 K), which is significantly higher than the values of 0.1 and 0.063 reported in the previous publications for as-prepared samples.3,4 Since the temperature parameter and occupancy factor can sometimes be highly correlated, refinements were also carried out over a wide range of values for _B_[O(3)], varying from 0.1 to 3.2 A2. The corresponding values of _n_[O(3)] only changed from 0.15(1) to 0.21(1), confirming that the amount of extra oxygen in the as-prepared sample used in our experiment is about 0.18 atoms per formula unit. Refinements in which the occupancies of Hg, Ba, and Cu were varied showed that the amounts of those metals in the structure were not statistically different from the assumed nominal stoichiometry [_n_(Hg) = 0.99(2), _n_(Ba) = 1.07(2), and _n_(Cu) = 1.06(2)]. Attempts to refine the occupancy of the oxygen on the \left\{ {\frac{1}{2}},0,z\right\} site gave a value of n = -0.008(8), indicating that this position is completely empty, in agreement with the results of Chmaissem _et al._4 The same refinement procedures were used for the other samples and for the data collected at each temperature. In addition, for the overdoped samples recent Raman and  differential thermogravimetric analysis data suggest that there may be another oxygen site in this compound,[18] in particular at the (_x_,x,_z_) or (1⁄2,1⁄2,2) sites. Refinements were thus also carried out with oxygen occupancy parameters at these sites, but no statistically significant occupancy was observed.

In the final refinement for each (8,_T_), the occupancies of all atoms except the O(3) site were kept fixed at their stoichiometric values (except as discussed below). Figure 1 shows the room-temperature diffraction pattern obtained on the as-prepared sample. The difference between the refinement and the observations is shown at the bottom, and we see that the model provides an excellent representation of the data. The only impurity peaks found in the pattern occur at 2_th_ ~ 20 * and 42 *, and the phase producing these peaks has not been identified. The results of these refinements are presented in Table 2 and the relevant bond distances are listed in Table 3.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We first consider the basic features and general trends of the structure of HgBa2CuO4+8, shown schematically in Fig. 2, as a function of oxygen doping (and temperature). As noted earlier, the copper atoms are coordinated by six oxygen atoms which form a very elongated octahedron, with a Cu-O(2) apical distance of 2.78 A and a Cu-O(1) in-plane distance of 1.94 A (at 296 K). In the stoichiometric compound the Ba ions are eightfold coordinated, by four O(1) and four O(2) atoms. This coordination becomes ninefold when O(3) is present and the coordination polyhedron can be considered to be a capped cubo-octahedron. The number of Ba atoms with ninefold coordination depends of course on the O(3) content d. The coordination of the Hg ions also depends on how the O(3) are distributed in the plane (HgO6), as shown in Fig. 3. If locally all the 1⁄2,1⁄2,0 sites are empty the mercury will have twofold coordination via the O(2) sites along the c axis, while if they are all occupied it will have sixfold octahedral coordination. For intermediate cases, different kinds of coordination are possible: If only one of the positions (_A_, B, C, or _D_) is occupied then the Hg atom in the center is threefold coordinated, if two are occupied we have either square-planar (_A_ + B or C + _B_) or tetrahedral (_A_ + B, A + C, etc.) coordination, and finally, if any three of the possible positions are occupied the polyhedron will be a fivefold pyramid.

Figure 4 shows the variation of the lattice parameters and bond distances of the as-prepared sample as a function of temperature; similar results are obtained for the other values of d. The a and c lattice parameters decrease

The difference between the observations and the calculated profile is shown at the bottom of the figure.

   by 0.0091 and 0.0265 A, respectively, as the temperature decreases from 296 to 10 K. The smooth variation of these quantities makes it evident there is no structural transition occurring as a function of temperature. It is interesting to note that the apical distance Cu-O(2) decreases significantly as the temperature decreases. Since the Hg-O(2) distance remains practically constant over the temperature range explored, it follows that the observed variation of the c axis with temperature is all reflected in the change of the Cu-O(2) apical distance. This behavior is in agreement with the results obtained by Wagner _et al._,[3] but it is different from that observed in Hg1212 (Ref. 9) and Hg1223,[12] where a decrease of the Hg-O distance was observed with decreasing temperature, with little variation in the Cu-O apical distance.

The oxygen content d in the material was varied from 0.04 to 0.23 via different annealing conditions. We first reduced the oxygen content by annealing in vacuum (_S_1-AV), and d was reduced from 0.18 to 0.08, with a corresponding _T_c of 53 K. The sample was then reannealed in O2 (_S_1-RAO), and d and _T_c returned to 0.18 and 94 K, respectively. All the structural parameters also returned to those of the as-prepared sample, with most of the differences being within one standard deviation. Thus the variation in oxygen content is completely reversible. The room-temperature variations of a, c, and bond distances are shown in Fig. 5 as a function of the oxygen content d. The a axis decreases smoothly and almost linearly as d increases from 0.04 to 0.023. The c axis, on the other hand, initially increases with increasing oxygen content, and then decreases smoothly with further increase of d. Just as with temperature, though, all the structural parameters vary smoothly with d, indicating that there are no structural transitions occurring as the oxygen content changes.

We now turn our attention to some of the more subtle features of the analysis and structure. As shown in Table 2, the temperature factors of some atoms are significantly larger than expected, in particular for the Hg, Ba, and O(2) sites. The large temperature factors could of course simply indicate a large thermal motion,

Figure 4: (a) Lattice parameters, (b) unit-cell volume, and (c), (d) selected bond distances, as a function of temperature.

  but they may also indicate a shift of the atomic position, some structural disorder in the position, or only partial occupation of the site. We thus carried out a number of additional refinements to investigate these possibilities.

One possible generalization is to allow the thermal displacements to have tetragonal symmetry (i.e., B11 = B22 \neq _B_33) rather than being isotropic. We thus carried out refinements allowing anisotropic thermal factors for the Hg, Ba, and the O(2) sites, while also refining the occupancy factors. The results are given in Table **IV**. The refinements show that the mean-square displacements for the O(2) remained essentially isotropic. For the Ba ions they are also isotropic for the lowest oxygen concentration (_d_ = 0.04), but become anisotropic, with B33 > B11, for larger d. This may indicate a shift or disorder along the c axis, and we will return to this question below. The refinements indicate that both of these sites are fully occupied.

For the Hg the overall mean-square displacements determined from the fits are large and anisotropic, with B11 > B33. This behavior was also observed in the higher-layer materials [9, 12, 14] and may be due to thermal motion or positional disordering. Since the O(3) sites on the Hg layers are partially occupied, we might imagine that the Hg occupy different positions depending on whether or not the O(3) sites are locally occupied. In the study of the Hg1212 system,[19] for example, the (apparent) thermal factor increased with increasing oxygen content, and was interpreted in terms of the degree of the disorder in the structure depending on the oxygen content. However, in the present analysis we do not find such a dependence on d. In addition, attempts to shift the Hg from its ideal position (0,0,0) to (_x_,x,_z_) gave x = 0.00(2) and z = 0.01(4), and did not improve the agreement in the fit. These results indicate that if there is any positional disorder at all it is too small to be detected in the present powder-diffraction data.

Another possible interpretation of the large temperature factor of Hg is that the site is not fully occupied, or that some of the Hg ions have been replaced by another element (such as Cu) with a smaller scattering amplitude. The possible loss of Hg during the repeated sample annealings is a particular concern because of its high vapor pressure. Consider the possibility of Cu substitution on the Hg site. Since _b_Cu = 0.77 while _b_vacancy = 0, we would have to have 23% of the sites actually occupied by Cu to account for an apparent 9% Hg vacancy (see Table **IV**), for example. Since there was no significant weight loss during the initial sample preparation, and since both the Cu and Ba sites in the primary compound are fully occupied, we would then need 46% of the Ba in impurity phases, while in actuality any impurity phases constitute

Figure 6: **Distance of the Ba ion (_z_ coordinate) from the O(1) and O(2) planes of oxygen ions, showing that the Ba ion moves towards the O(3) site with increasing _δ_.**

 <\!1.5\%. We also did not find any significant changes in the intensities of the weak impurity peaks as a function of \delta in all the samples involved in these experiments. Thus any possible Cu occupancy on the Hg sites is at the few percent level at most; we believe it is more likely that the true thermal displacements are large, or that there are some vacancies or small positional disorder on the Hg sites.

We now turn to the interesting situation of the Ba site. The data of Fig. 5(c) show that the Ba-O(2 or 3) distances decrease while the Ba-O(1) distance increases with increasing \delta, which suggests that the Ba ions are shifting. Figure 6 shows more clearly that this is indeed the case. We see that the distance of the Ba ion from the O(2) plane decreases while the distance to the O(1) plane increases with increasing \delta. This shift in the z coordinate is quite substantial (-\!0.100 and 0.065 A, for the Ba\toO(2) plane and Ba\toO(1) plane, respectively), while the Ba-O(3) bond contracts \sim\!0.08 A. Note in particular that these shifts are much larger than the overall contraction of c of only 0.028 A over the range of \delta explored.

Since the O(3) site in the structure is only partially occupied, one may speculate that the Ba atoms shift along the c axis when an O(3) ion is present, as shown in Fig. 7. We therefore refined a model with two Ba sites, Ba(1) at [\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},z(1)] and Ba(2) at [\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},z(2)]. We also allowed the

However, we obtained significantly different _z_(1) and _z_(2), which were accompanied by smaller temperature factors as shown in Table IV (bottom). The only exception was for the d = 0.04 sample, where the Ba yielded an almost isotropic thermal parameter. For this low occupancy the calculation with the two-site Ba model gave meaningless results.

Figure 8(a) shows the ratio of B33/_B_11 for the Ba ion plotted as a function of d. The increase in B33 which causes this behavior we interpret as the disorder and/or shift of the Ba when the O(3) site is occupied. There is clearly a strong variation, with a maximum at d \approx 0.18 which is just at the maximum of _T_c(d). In fact, the behavior of B33/_B_11 mirrors the entire _T_c(d) as shown in Fig. 8(b). Here the _T_c(d) data (solid points) are from this study, while the triangles are _T_c(_P_TEP), where _P_TEP is the hole per Cu as determined by thermoelectric power measurements.[15] It is clear that the behavior of _T_c(_P_TEP) is very similar to _T_c(d). In the underdoped regime _T_c decreases with decreasing d, and _T_c becomes 0 for d \leq 0.04. This means that this material is not a self-doped superconductor, in contrast to an early suggestion.[20] In the overdoped region, _T_c rapidly decreases from 95 to 30 K as d increases from 0.18 to 0.23. Thermogravimetric measurements, however, indicate that there is more oxygen present in the sample than is observed at the O(3) site,[15] and this led to the speculation that another oxygen site was also occupied. However, in the present study we have not been able to detect such an extra oxygen site.

Finally we comment on the rate of doping caused by the insertion of O(3) in this system. One of the interesting points from these hole-doping studies,[15] as shown in Fig. 8(b), was that the doping level onto the Cu layer corresponds to only about one electron transferred per O(3) oxygen instead of the customary O^{2-}. This reduced doping has also been seen in band-structure calculations based on the local-density approximation, carried out to elucidate the effects of oxygen doping on Hg1223.[21] In the HgBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+2+8} series of superconductors, the CuO_{2} planes are considered to be hole doped by the extra oxygen on the mercury layers. These additional oxygen atoms are strongly bound to the barium located on the nearest layers and this causes the barium to move away from the oxygen in the Cu layers and towards the Hg layer. The data of Fig. 8(a) clearly demonstrate that there is a direct relationship between the doping and the average movement of Ba as a function of d. In Table V we present calculations of the formal valence values obtained with Brown's method of valence and/or distance relationships,[22] which tend to be accurate to 10-20 %. It is very interesting to note that the valence on O(3) comes out to be just under one electron per ion, in agreement with experimental observation for this material.

Powder neutron-diffraction profile refinement techniques have been used to investigate the oxygen dependence of the crystal structure and its effect on the superconducting phase transition in high-quality samples of the superconductor HgBa2CuO4+-6 (0.04 <= 6 <= 0.23). The system remains tetragonal (space group P4/_mmm_) over the full range of temperature (10-300 K) and oxygen concentration explored. The _a_-axis lattice parameter decreases smoothly with increasing d, while the _c_-axis lattice parameter exhibits a maximum. The extra oxygen in the material is found to randomly occupy the centered O(3) site (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0) in the Hg layer, and no other additional site for the extra oxygen was found in the structure. There is also no mixing of the cations on the Cu and Hg sites. T_{c} is observed to vary strongly with d, increasing from 0 K for d = 0.04 to a maximum T_{c} = 95 K at d = 0.18, and then decreasing rapidly for larger d. The relationship of T_{c}(\delta) to the rate of hole doping on the CuO2 planes indicates that this doping level is only half of that expected for O2- ions. Our structural studies reveal an interesting correlation between the occupation of the O(3) site and the movement of the Ba ions towards the O(3) and away from the Cu-O planes. The Ba layer thus becomes structurally disordered, and this disorder is found to closely mirror the T_{c}(\delta) behavior. Valence and/or distance arguments for the O(3) then suggest that this oxygen is only singly ionized.

## Introduction

The new mercury superconductors of formula HgBa2Ca -1Cu2O2 +- 6 have generated considerable interest in the superconductivity community because of the high transition temperatures associated with these compounds.1-14 In particular, the single layer (_n_ = 1) material (designated Hg1201) has the highest superconducting transition temperature of any one-layer cuprate, with T_{c} = 95 K. T_{c} is found to initially increase with the number of layers in the unit cell (analogous to the Tl and Bi series of materials), with T_{c} = 126 K for n = 2 (Hg1212) and 135 K (Hg1223) for n = 3. In addition, these transition temperatures increase with the application of pressure, saturating at 118, 154, and 164 K for n = 1,2,3, respectively.13 The fourth member (Hg1234) has also been synthesized,11 with a somewhat lower T_{c} of 126 K, while T_{c} is found to decrease to 101 K for the five Cu-layer system (Hg1245).14

All the compounds belonging to this series of materials have the same tetragonal P4/_mmm_ symmetry, with lattice parameters given approximately by a \approx 3.85 A, and c  9.5 +- 3.2(_n_ - 1) A. Their structures consist of a simple stacking of layers:

\[n = 1 : \left[ \left( \text{Hg}\text{O}_{6} \right)_{o}\left( \text{BaO} \right)_{c}\left( \text{CuO}_{2} \right)_{o}\left( \text{BaO} \right)_{c}\left[ \text{Hg}\text{O}_{6} \right)_{o}\ldots\right.\] \[n = 2 : \left[ \left( \text{Hg}\text{O}_{6} \right)_{o}\left( \text{BaO} \right)_{c}\left( \text{CuO}_{2} \right)_{o}\left( \text{Ca} \right)_{c}\left( \text{CuO}_{2} \right)_{o}\ (CuO2) layer are coplanar, or almost coplanar, with the copper atoms, in contrast to other superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7 where the (CuO2) planes are significantly buckled.

The simplest Hg material from a structural point of view is, of course, the single-layer HgBa2CuO4+-d system, and we have therefore undertaken a detailed study of the crystallography as a function of oxygen doping to elucidate the relationship between the structure and superconducting properties. The crystal structure of HgBa2CuO4+-d has already been analyzed in some detail via neutron powder diffraction by Wagner _et al._3 and by Chmaissem _et al._4 In the study by Wagner _et al._3 it was suggested that some of the Cu substitutes onto the Hg sites, with a correlation between this Cu substitution and the oxygen doping in the Hg layer. However, Chmaissem _et al._,4 as well as the present results on more phase-pure samples, show that there is no mixing of the cations within experimental error. Recent studies of the effect of oxygen doping on the T_{c} for Hg1201 suggest, though, that there may be two kinds of oxygen-doping sites in the material.15 In order to address this question as well as to clarify the relationship between the superconductivity and the crystal structure, we have prepared high-quality samples of HgBa2CuO4+-d and have used powder neutron diffraction to analyze the structure of the compounds as a function of doping d. We have not been able to identify a second oxygen site, but we have found a direct structural correlation between the doped oxygen and the Ba ions, which mirrors the behavior of T_{c}(d).

## Experimental procedures

The powder samples of HgBa2CuO4+-d were prepared for the neutron powder diffraction studies by using the solid-state reaction technique described by Meng _et al._16 The heat-treatment conditions of the specimens are listed in Table I. The sample labeled S1 was used to obtain most of the diffraction data. In each case the sample was prepared and/or heat treated to obtain a particular oxygen concentration. The sample was then characterized by both x-ray-diffraction and magnetic-susceptibility measurements. The observed onset superconducting transition temperatures are also shown in Table I; further details of the superconducting properties and measurements of these samples can be found elsewhere.15 The neutron-diffraction data were then obtained and analyzed, before the sample was further heat treated to investigate a different oxygen concentration. A second sample was prepared and annealed for the final measurement, and is designated S2.

Neutron powder-diffraction data were collected using the 32-detector high-resolution powder diffractometer located at the Research Reactor of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The Cu(311) monochromator was employed at a wavelength of 1.539(1) A. The horizontal collimations used were 15', 20', and 7' (full-width-at-half maximum) before and after the monochromator, respectively, and after the sample. A cylindrical vanadium sample holder was used to hold the powder, which was then mounted in a He refrigerator to control the temperature.

The structural refinements were carried out with the general structure analysis system (GSAS) program of Larson and Von Dreele17 using the intensity data in the 2_th_ range from 8 to 145deg. Neutron-scattering amplitudes used in the refinements were 1.266, 0.525, 0.772, and 0.581 (10-12 cm) for Hg, Ba, Cu, and O, respectively.17 All the observed peaks in the diffraction pattern were accounted for by the expected Hg1201 structure, with the exception of two whose intensities were less than 1.5% of the strongest peak. The small impurity content attests to the high quality of the samples. There was a significant amount of nuclear absorption by the Hg, and thus the values of _mR_ were determined experimentally for each sample. They ranged from 0.34-0.52, and the intensity data were then corrected for absorption in the standard way.17

The initial refinement in each case was carried out assuming the symmetry of space group P4/_mmm_ and using as starting parameters those given by Chmaissem _et al._4 The occupancy factors for the extra oxygen atoms O(3) located at \left( {\frac{1}{2}},{\frac{1}{2}},0\right) on the (HgO8) layer were refined with the other parameters, keeping the thermal factor _B_[O(3)] fixed. The value of _n_[O(3)] obtained in this calculation was 0.18 for the as-prepared sample (T_{c} = 95 K), which is significantly higher than the values of 0.1 and 0.063 reported in the previous publications for as-prepared samples.3,4 Since the temperature parameter and occupancy factor can sometimes be highly correlated, refinements were also carried out over a wide range of values for _B_[O(3)], varying from 0.1 to 3.2 A2. The corresponding values of _n_[O(3)] only changed from 0.15(1) to 0.21(1), confirming that the amount of extra oxygen in the as-prepared sample used in our experiment is about 0.18 atoms per formula unit. Refinements in which the occupancies of Hg, Ba, and Cu were varied showed that the amounts of those metals in the structure were not statistically different from the assumed nominal stoichiometry [_n_(Hg) = 0.99(2), _n_(Ba) = 1.07(2), and _n_(Cu) = 1.06(2)]. Attempts to refine the occupancy of the oxygen on the \left\{ {\frac{1}{2}},0,z\right\} site gave a value of n = -0.008(8), indicating that this position is completely empty, in agreement with the results of Chmaissem _et al._4 The same refinement procedures were used for the other samples and for the data collected at each temperature. In addition, for the overdoped samples recent Raman and  differential thermogravimetric analysis data suggest that there may be another oxygen site in this compound,[18] in particular at the (_x_,x,_z_) or (1⁄2,1⁄2,2) sites. Refinements were thus also carried out with oxygen occupancy parameters at these sites, but no statistically significant occupancy was observed.

In the final refinement for each (8,_T_), the occupancies of all atoms except the O(3) site were kept fixed at their stoichiometric values (except as discussed below). Figure 1 shows the room-temperature diffraction pattern obtained on the as-prepared sample. The difference between the refinement and the observations is shown at the bottom, and we see that the model provides an excellent representation of the data. The only impurity peaks found in the pattern occur at 2_th_ ~ 20 * and 42 *, and the phase producing these peaks has not been identified. The results of these refinements are presented in Table 2 and the relevant bond distances are listed in Table 3.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We first consider the basic features and general trends of the structure of HgBa2CuO4+8, shown schematically in Fig. 2, as a function of oxygen doping (and temperature). As noted earlier, the copper atoms are coordinated by six oxygen atoms which form a very elongated octahedron, with a Cu-O(2) apical distance of 2.78 A and a Cu-O(1) in-plane distance of 1.94 A (at 296 K). In the stoichiometric compound the Ba ions are eightfold coordinated, by four O(1) and four O(2) atoms. This coordination becomes ninefold when O(3) is present and the coordination polyhedron can be considered to be a capped cubo-octahedron. The number of Ba atoms with ninefold coordination depends of course on the O(3) content d. The coordination of the Hg ions also depends on how the O(3) are distributed in the plane (HgO6), as shown in Fig. 3. If locally all the 1⁄2,1⁄2,0 sites are empty the mercury will have twofold coordination via the O(2) sites along the c axis, while if they are all occupied it will have sixfold octahedral coordination. For intermediate cases, different kinds of coordination are possible: If only one of the positions (_A_, B, C, or _D_) is occupied then the Hg atom in the center is threefold coordinated, if two are occupied we have either square-planar (_A_ + B or C + _B_) or tetrahedral (_A_ + B, A + C, etc.) coordination, and finally, if any three of the possible positions are occupied the polyhedron will be a fivefold pyramid.

Figure 4 shows the variation of the lattice parameters and bond distances of the as-prepared sample as a function of temperature; similar results are obtained for the other values of d. The a and c lattice parameters decrease

The difference between the observations and the calculated profile is shown at the bottom of the figure.

   by 0.0091 and 0.0265 A, respectively, as the temperature decreases from 296 to 10 K. The smooth variation of these quantities makes it evident there is no structural transition occurring as a function of temperature. It is interesting to note that the apical distance Cu-O(2) decreases significantly as the temperature decreases. Since the Hg-O(2) distance remains practically constant over the temperature range explored, it follows that the observed variation of the c axis with temperature is all reflected in the change of the Cu-O(2) apical distance. This behavior is in agreement with the results obtained by Wagner _et al._,[3] but it is different from that observed in Hg1212 (Ref. 9) and Hg1223,[12] where a decrease of the Hg-O distance was observed with decreasing temperature, with little variation in the Cu-O apical distance.

The oxygen content d in the material was varied from 0.04 to 0.23 via different annealing conditions. We first reduced the oxygen content by annealing in vacuum (_S_1-AV), and d was reduced from 0.18 to 0.08, with a corresponding _T_c of 53 K. The sample was then reannealed in O2 (_S_1-RAO), and d and _T_c returned to 0.18 and 94 K, respectively. All the structural parameters also returned to those of the as-prepared sample, with most of the differences being within one standard deviation. Thus the variation in oxygen content is completely reversible. The room-temperature variations of a, c, and bond distances are shown in Fig. 5 as a function of the oxygen content d. The a axis decreases smoothly and almost linearly as d increases from 0.04 to 0.023. The c axis, on the other hand, initially increases with increasing oxygen content, and then decreases smoothly with further increase of d. Just as with temperature, though, all the structural parameters vary smoothly with d, indicating that there are no structural transitions occurring as the oxygen content changes.

We now turn our attention to some of the more subtle features of the analysis and structure. As shown in Table 2, the temperature factors of some atoms are significantly larger than expected, in particular for the Hg, Ba, and O(2) sites. The large temperature factors could of course simply indicate a large thermal motion,

Figure 4: (a) Lattice parameters, (b) unit-cell volume, and (c), (d) selected bond distances, as a function of temperature.

  but they may also indicate a shift of the atomic position, some structural disorder in the position, or only partial occupation of the site. We thus carried out a number of additional refinements to investigate these possibilities.

One possible generalization is to allow the thermal displacements to have tetragonal symmetry (i.e., B11 = B22 \neq _B_33) rather than being isotropic. We thus carried out refinements allowing anisotropic thermal factors for the Hg, Ba, and the O(2) sites, while also refining the occupancy factors. The results are given in Table **IV**. The refinements show that the mean-square displacements for the O(2) remained essentially isotropic. For the Ba ions they are also isotropic for the lowest oxygen concentration (_d_ = 0.04), but become anisotropic, with B33 > B11, for larger d. This may indicate a shift or disorder along the c axis, and we will return to this question below. The refinements indicate that both of these sites are fully occupied.

For the Hg the overall mean-square displacements determined from the fits are large and anisotropic, with B11 > B33. This behavior was also observed in the higher-layer materials [9, 12, 14] and may be due to thermal motion or positional disordering. Since the O(3) sites on the Hg layers are partially occupied, we might imagine that the Hg occupy different positions depending on whether or not the O(3) sites are locally occupied. In the study of the Hg1212 system,[19] for example, the (apparent) thermal factor increased with increasing oxygen content, and was interpreted in terms of the degree of the disorder in the structure depending on the oxygen content. However, in the present analysis we do not find such a dependence on d. In addition, attempts to shift the Hg from its ideal position (0,0,0) to (_x_,x,_z_) gave x = 0.00(2) and z = 0.01(4), and did not improve the agreement in the fit. These results indicate that if there is any positional disorder at all it is too small to be detected in the present powder-diffraction data.

Another possible interpretation of the large temperature factor of Hg is that the site is not fully occupied, or that some of the Hg ions have been replaced by another element (such as Cu) with a smaller scattering amplitude. The possible loss of Hg during the repeated sample annealings is a particular concern because of its high vapor pressure. Consider the possibility of Cu substitution on the Hg site. Since _b_Cu = 0.77 while _b_vacancy = 0, we would have to have 23% of the sites actually occupied by Cu to account for an apparent 9% Hg vacancy (see Table **IV**), for example. Since there was no significant weight loss during the initial sample preparation, and since both the Cu and Ba sites in the primary compound are fully occupied, we would then need 46% of the Ba in impurity phases, while in actuality any impurity phases constitute

Figure 6: **Distance of the Ba ion (_z_ coordinate) from the O(1) and O(2) planes of oxygen ions, showing that the Ba ion moves towards the O(3) site with increasing _δ_.**

 <\!1.5\%. We also did not find any significant changes in the intensities of the weak impurity peaks as a function of \delta in all the samples involved in these experiments. Thus any possible Cu occupancy on the Hg sites is at the few percent level at most; we believe it is more likely that the true thermal displacements are large, or that there are some vacancies or small positional disorder on the Hg sites.

We now turn to the interesting situation of the Ba site. The data of Fig. 5(c) show that the Ba-O(2 or 3) distances decrease while the Ba-O(1) distance increases with increasing \delta, which suggests that the Ba ions are shifting. Figure 6 shows more clearly that this is indeed the case. We see that the distance of the Ba ion from the O(2) plane decreases while the distance to the O(1) plane increases with increasing \delta. This shift in the z coordinate is quite substantial (-\!0.100 and 0.065 A, for the Ba\toO(2) plane and Ba\toO(1) plane, respectively), while the Ba-O(3) bond contracts \sim\!0.08 A. Note in particular that these shifts are much larger than the overall contraction of c of only 0.028 A over the range of \delta explored.

Since the O(3) site in the structure is only partially occupied, one may speculate that the Ba atoms shift along the c axis when an O(3) ion is present, as shown in Fig. 7. We therefore refined a model with two Ba sites, Ba(1) at [\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},z(1)] and Ba(2) at [\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},z(2)]. We also allowed the

However, we obtained significantly different _z_(1) and _z_(2), which were accompanied by smaller temperature factors as shown in Table IV (bottom). The only exception was for the d = 0.04 sample, where the Ba yielded an almost isotropic thermal parameter. For this low occupancy the calculation with the two-site Ba model gave meaningless results.

Figure 8(a) shows the ratio of B33/_B_11 for the Ba ion plotted as a function of d. The increase in B33 which causes this behavior we interpret as the disorder and/or shift of the Ba when the O(3) site is occupied. There is clearly a strong variation, with a maximum at d \approx 0.18 which is just at the maximum of _T_c(d). In fact, the behavior of B33/_B_11 mirrors the entire _T_c(d) as shown in Fig. 8(b). Here the _T_c(d) data (solid points) are from this study, while the triangles are _T_c(_P_TEP), where _P_TEP is the hole per Cu as determined by thermoelectric power measurements.[15] It is clear that the behavior of _T_c(_P_TEP) is very similar to _T_c(d). In the underdoped regime _T_c decreases with decreasing d, and _T_c becomes 0 for d \leq 0.04. This means that this material is not a self-doped superconductor, in contrast to an early suggestion.[20] In the overdoped region, _T_c rapidly decreases from 95 to 30 K as d increases from 0.18 to 0.23. Thermogravimetric measurements, however, indicate that there is more oxygen present in the sample than is observed at the O(3) site,[15] and this led to the speculation that another oxygen site was also occupied. However, in the present study we have not been able to detect such an extra oxygen site.

Finally we comment on the rate of doping caused by the insertion of O(3) in this system. One of the interesting points from these hole-doping studies,[15] as shown in Fig. 8(b), was that the doping level onto the Cu layer corresponds to only about one electron transferred per O(3) oxygen instead of the customary O^{2-}. This reduced doping has also been seen in band-structure calculations based on the local-density approximation, carried out to elucidate the effects of oxygen doping on Hg1223.[21] In the HgBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+2+8} series of superconductors, the CuO_{2} planes are considered to be hole doped by the extra oxygen on the mercury layers. These additional oxygen atoms are strongly bound to the barium located on the nearest layers and this causes the barium to move away from the oxygen in the Cu layers and towards the Hg layer. The data of Fig. 8(a) clearly demonstrate that there is a direct relationship between the doping and the average movement of Ba as a function of d. In Table V we present calculations of the formal valence values obtained with Brown's method of valence and/or distance relationships,[22] which tend to be accurate to 10-20 %. It is very interesting to note that the valence on O(3) comes out to be just under one electron per ion, in agreement with experimental observation for this material.
