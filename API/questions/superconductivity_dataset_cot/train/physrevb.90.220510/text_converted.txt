###### Abstract

The pressure effect on the newly discovered charge-transferred
BiS2-based superconductor, Eu3Bi2S4F4, with a T_(c) of 1.5 K at ambient
pressure, is investigated by transport and magnetic measurements.
Accompanied with the enhancement of metallicity under pressures, the
onset superconducting transition temperature increases abruptly around
1.0 GPa, reaching ∼10.0 K at 2.26 GPa. Alternating current magnetic
susceptibility measurements indicate that a new superconducting phase
with a higher T_(c) emerges and dominates at high pressures. In the
broad pressure window of 0.68 GPa  ≤ p≤ 2.00 GPa, the high-T_(c) phase
coexists with the low-T_(c) phase. Hall effect measurements reveal a
significant difference in electronic structures between the two
superconducting phases. Our work devotes the effort to establish the
commonality of pressure effect on the BiS2-based superconductors, and
also uncovers the importance of electron carrier density in the
high-T_(c) phase.

The layered bismuth-sulfide superconductors have recently attracted much
attention after the generations of cuprates [1] and iron-pnictides [2].
Following the discovery of superconductivity (SC) in Bi4O4S3 (T_(c) =
8.6 K) [3], SC was also discovered in LnBi2S2O0_(1 − x)F_(x) (Ln = La,
Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb[4]-8, LaBiSe2O1_(1 − x)F_(x)[9, 10], and the structural
analogs Sr1_(x − La)In_(x)BiS2F (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm) [11, 12] and
EuBiS2F [13]. Besides chemical doping, pressure effect is another
promising way to search for and/or enhance SC in BiS2-based compounds.
Taking LaBiS2O0_(x)F_(0.5) as an example, the sample grown at
atmospheric pressure becomes superconducting below ∼3.3 K. While under
pressure, T_(c) initially increases via a transient process, reaches a
maximum value of ∼10.1 K at around 1.2 GPa, and then gradually decreases
with increasing pressure [14]. High-pressure x-ray diffraction (XRD)
measurements suggested a structural phase transition from tetragonal
(P4/nmm) to monoclinic (P2₁/m) at ∼0.8 GPa, which is probably associated
with the pressure-induced enhancement of SC [15].

Recently, Zhai _et al._ reported the anomalous Eu-valence state and
superconductivity in "undoped" Eu3Bi2S4F4 [16]. This compound
crystallizes in a tetragonal structure with I4/mmn (No. 139) space
group. The Eu3F4-layer and BiS2-bilayer stack alternately along **c**
axis, developing a highly two-dimensional (2D) crystalline structure.
There are three Eu ions in one unit cell occupying two inequivalent
crystallographical sites: two of the Eu ions [denoted by Eu(1)] are
essentially divalent and form an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering below
T_(N) = 2.3 K; while the third Eu ion [Eu(2)] has an average valence of
∼ +2.6. This intermediate Eu-valence state donates electrons into the
conducting BiS2 layers. SC with T_(c) = 1.5 K was achieved in this
self-doped material. One intuitive attempt is to tune the
superconductivity as well as Eu valence by means of pressure effect.
Since an external pressure potentially strengthens the hybridization
between Eu-4f and Bi-6p orbitals, a higher T_(c) is possible if more
charges are transferred into the BiS2 layers.

In this paper, we report the hydrostatic pressure effect on Eu3Bi2S4F4
by electrical resistivity, Hall effect, and ac magnetic susceptibility
measurements. We find that the Eu valence is essentially unchanged under
pressures up to 2.26 GPa, and that the T versus p electronic phase
diagram basically resembles that of LnBi2S2O0_(x)F_(0.5)F_(0.15)[14,
17]. The onset of superconducting transition jumps from ∼1.5 to ∼10.0 K
at the pressure around 1.00 GPa, in the vicinity of which a new
high-T_(c) SC phase emerges. Both of the two SC phases are of bulk
nature, and they coexist in a wide pressure range. The Eu(1) AFM
ordering becomes indistinguishable near the onset of this new SC phase.
A significant difference in electronic structures between these two SC
phases is revealed by Hall effect measurement.

A polycrystalline Eu3Bi2S4F4 sample of high quality was synthesized by
solid state reaction as described elsewhere [16]. By controlling a
suitable S deficiency in the nominal composition (∼2.5

Figure 1(a) displays several representative ρ(T) curves measured at
various pressures. At ambient pressure, ρ(T) shows a metallic-like
temperature dependence above 140 K, below which ρ(T) turns up that was
attributed to Anderson localization (probably due to S deficiency) [16].
We emphasize that the sample investigated in this work is better in
phase purity than the one reported in our previous paper [16], confirmed
by XRD (data not shown). Although the upturn in ρ(T) at low temperature
looks more pronounced, the magnitude of resistivity for the whole
temperature range is lower. The material shows a sharp superconducting
transition at T_(c) = 1.5 K at ambient pressure, in good agreement with
the previous report. In general, metallicity of Eu₃Bi₂S₄F₄ is greatly
enhanced under pressure, and meanwhile the semiconducting behavior is
gradually suppressed. In Fig. 1(b), we present an expanded view of the
low-temperature part to show the superconducting transition more
clearly. For p < 1.58 GPa, the superconducting transition width broadens
significantly, whilst for higher pressures, the transition sharpens
again at about 9 K. Herein we take the onset of SC transition
[$T_{c}^{\rm on}$ illustrated in Fig. 1(b)] as the characteristic
temperature, which has been widely adopted in most of the literature on
BiS₂-based superconductors. For the highest pressure we have achieved,
p = 2.26 GPa, $T_{c}^{\rm on}$ reaches 10.0 K, which is comparable to
the highest record ($T_{c}^{\rm on}$ = 10.7 K for LaBiS₂O_(8.5)F_(0.5)
under an optimized pressure [15]) in BiS₂-based superconductors.
Obviously, $T_{c}^{\rm on}$ is still going up with pressure. This
implies that the $T_{c}^{\rm on}$ value could be further elevated at
higher pressures.

We summarize the resistivity results by presenting a contour plot of
ρ(p, T) shown in Fig. 2. The blue region on the bottom of Fig. 2
characterizes SC. One clearly finds the broadened SC transition under
moderate pressures by looking at the light-blue part on the border of
the SC region. It is worthwhile to point out that the pressure effect
reported here resembles that observed in most LnBiS₂O_(0.5)F_(0.5) (Ln =
La,Ce,Pr,Nd) systems [10, 14, 15, 17]. We may remark the common feature
that a new SC phase with a higher T_(c) emerges at high pressure for
BiS₂-based superconductors. For clarity, hereafter the low-T_(c) SC
phase is called SC1, while the high-T_(c) SC phase is named as SC2. In
our result, both SC1 and SC2 are enhanced under pressure; this is in
contrast to the LnBiS₂O_(0.5)F_(0.5) systems [10, 14, 17], in which
T_(c) immediately starts to decrease after SC2 is stabilized at high
pressure. This discrepancy is probably because the self-doped Eu₃Bi₂S₄F₄
resides in the under-doped regime (∼30

Turning now to the ac magnetic susceptibility. The real part of the
voltage signal, after being subtracted by the background (measured from
the empty coil), was calibrated by the dc magnetic susceptibility χ_(δδ)
(p = 0, see Ref. [16]). The real part of the ac susceptibility χ^(′) are
shown in Fig. 3 as a function of T. In the normal state, within the data
resolution, χ^(′)(T) for all the pressures almost collapse onto a single
Curie-Weiss-like curve, strongly demonstrating that the valence state of
Eu(2) essentially remains unchanged under pressures up to 2.26 GPa. In
the inset to Fig. 3(a), we show the low temperature part of χ^(′)(T).
For p = 0, the peak at T_(N) = 2.35 K corresponds to the AFM transition
of Eu(1) moments. Below T_(c)^(χ) = 1.49 K, χ^(′)(T) starts to drop
rapidly, indicating the bulk SC1 phase transition. With increasing
pressure, both T_(N) and T_(c)^(χ) increase slightly, and meanwhile the
diamagnetic Meissner effect below T_(c)^(χ) becomes more pronounced. At
p = 1.14 GPa, χ^(′)(T) starts to deviate from the Curie-Weiss-like
behavior around T_(c2)^(χ) = 2.54 K, while no clear AFM transition can
be distinguished.

$T_{c}^{\rm on}$ characterizes the onset of SC transition in ρ(T);
$T_{c}^{\rm off}$ represents the temperature below which the resistivity
is smaller than 1

whereas, (b) displays an enlarged plot of ρ(T) below 15 K. Also shown in
(b) is the definition of the onset temperature $T_{c}^{\rm on}$.

Combined with the resistivity, T_(c2)^(χ) should be ascribed to the SC2
phase transition. Apparently, both SC1 and SC2 phases are bulk
properties, and the two phases coexist in a wide pressure range.
T_(c2)^(χ) increases quickly in the moderate pressure region. 1.14 GPa
 ≤ p≤ 1.58 GPa, and finally slows down at the high pressure region,
seeing Fig. 3(b). At p = 2.26 GPa, a complete Meissner effect is
observed below T_(c2)^(χ), while no clear sign of SC1 phase can be seen.
The diamagnetic volume fraction 4π χ^(′) at this pressure exceeds 150

We now fulfill the phase diagram of the pressure effect on Eu₃Bi₂S₄F₄,
as shown in Fig. 2. It is clearly seen that T_(c1)^(χ′)(p) overlaps with
T_(c1)^(χ)(p) at pressures up to 1.14 GPa. After a crossover-like
increase between 1.14 and 1.58 GPa, T_(c1)^(χ′)(p) coincides with
T_(c2)^(χ)(p) in the high pressure region. Since T_(c1)^(χ) and
T_(c2)^(χ) are the characteristic temperature scales for bulk SC1 and
SC2 transitions, this pressure dependent T_(c1)^(χ′) supports the phase
separation picture. We also notice a salient feature on this phase
diagram, that the long-range Eu(1) AFM transition becomes
indistinguishable near the pressure where the SC2 phase emerges.
Intuitively, the AFM ordering is not favored in the SC2 phase, probably
because there is a competition between the SC condensation and the
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction that mediates the Eu(1)
AFM ordering. On the onset of SC2 phase, it forms like a small droplet.
_Microscopically_, these SC2 droplets randomly distribute inside the
bulk sample, which is likely to break the long range Eu(1) AFM ordering.
However, based on the present measurements, we can not exclude the
possibility that the Eu(1) AFM ordering, if it still survives in the SC1
phase under pressure, is masked by the predominant SC signal from the
SC2 phase. More sensitive and microscopic techniques, e.g., μSR and
neutron scattering experiments are required to solve this problem.

At the highest pressure p = 2.26 GPa in our study, where it is believed
to be a nearly pure phase of SC2, we systematically studied the
electrical resistivity under various magnetic fields. The data are shown
in Fig. 4(a). All these measurements were made after a field-cooling
process. With increasing field, T_(c)^(χ′) is drastically suppressed and
the zero-resistivity state can not be observed above 1.5 T for T ≥ 0.3
K. Whereas $T_{c}^{\rm on}$ seems more robust against an external
magnetic field, as seen in Fig. 4(b). When B exceeds 1.0 T, we observe
an additional anomaly in ρ(T) curve near 3 K. A similar phenomenon was
also observed in LaBiS₂O_(3.5)F_(0.5), and was interpreted as the
anisotropic upper critical field (B_(c2)) [18]. The high anisotropy of
B_(c2) in LaBiS₂O_(3.5)F_(0.5) was also confirmed by field rotation
experiments on single crystalline samples [19], which revealed that
B_(c2) in the **B**∥**c** direction is much smaller than that for
**B**∥**ab** direction. Due to the more 2D crystallographic structure of
Eu₃Bi₂S₄F₄, it is likely that this anisotropy of B_(c2) in Eu₃Bi₂S₄F₄
would be even higher than that in LaBiS₂O_(3.5)F_(0.5). Therefore it is
reasonable that the superconducting current path in those grains with
the orientation of c ∥ B can be destroyed at a temperature [defined as
T_(c)^(c) in Fig. 4(b)] that is lower than $T_{c}^{\rm on}$. In Fig.
4(c), we summarize the B_(c2) versus T phase diagram. Concave
dependencies are clearly seen, in both $T_{c}^{\rm on}$ and T_(c)^(c)
criterions, which is a signature of multi-band effect. The B_(c2)(0) for
**B**∥**c** is estimated to be ∼4.0 T; while for **B**∥**ab**, B_(c2)(0)
should be much higher but is hard to estimate.

data of which have been vertically shifted for clarity. (b) Diamagnetic
volume fraction (4π χ^(′)) as a function of T. Note that the
demagnetizaion factor is not taken into account.

Finally, we also measured the Hall effect under pressure. The
measurement was carried out at 15 K, well above the maximum T_(c)^(con).
Since the metallicity of the sample is greatly enhanced under pressure,
for comparison, we have converted Hall resistivity (ρ_(yx)) to Hall
conductivity (σ_(xy)) via
$\sigma_{xy}=\frac{\rho_{yx}}{\rho^{2}+\rho_{yx}^{2}}$. The field
dependent σ_(xy) for various pressures are displayed in Fig. 5. For all
the pressures, σ_(xy)(B) is severely nonlinear, implying the multiband
effect. At ambient pressure, σ_(xy)(B) is negative under low fields, but
undergoes a sign change at B = 4.2 T, seeing the inset to Fig. 5. Such a
profile of σ_(xy)(B) indicates the coexistence of electron-type minority
carriers with high mobility and hole-type majority carriers with low
mobility. In fact, earlier first-principles calculations on the analog
EuBiS₂F [based on a local spin density approximation with on-site
Coulomb interaction (LSDA+_U_)] manifested that there are three bands
across the Fermi level: one hole band near the M point and two electron
bands around the X point [13]. The hole band is from Eu(2)-4 f orbitals,
and thus is believed to be of low mobility. This hole band donates
electrons to the electron bands (mainly of Bi-6ρ characteristic [13,
20]), leaving the conduction bands in EuBiS₂F partially filled with
transferred charges. The situation could be similar in Eu₃Bi₂Si₂F₄, if
we consider that the Eu(1)F₂ layer only serves as an "insulating" block
[16]. As pressure increases, σ_(xy)(B) increases and becomes completely
positive in the mixture of SC1 and SC2. For p > 1.48 GPa where the SC2
phase is well developed, σ_(xy)(B) drops again, and becomes
electron-dominant at p = 2.26 GPa. Such an evolution of σ_(xy)(B) with
pressure is hard to interpret quantitatively. However, if we compare the
σ_(xy)(B) curves at p = 0 and 2.26 GPa, which can be regarded to be of
pure SC1 and SC2 phases, respectively, we may remark that a drastic
change in band structure and Fermi surface topology takes place when it
changes from SC1 phase to SC2 phase. Recently, Tomita _et al._ reported
a structural phase transition in LaBiS₂O₈F_(0.5) between the
ambient-pressure and high-pressure states [15]. Further density
functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that a structural phase
transition from a tetragonal P4/nmm phase at ambient pressure to a
monoclinic P2₁/m phase at high pressure occurs upon pressurizing. A
similar structural phase transition could also happen in Eu₃Bi₂Si₂F₄
under pressure, and a new superconducting phase (namely the SC2 phase)
with a higher T_(c) is favored in this modified crystalline structure.
Moreover, because the RKKY interaction depends on electrons near as well
as deep inside the Fermi sea, suppression of the RKKY interaction by SC
allows additional electrons to participate in SC condensation. This may
result in a higher T_(c) in the SC2 phase of Eu₃Bi₂Si₂F₄, and other
BiS₂-based superconductors as well. Of course, to clarify this issue,
more theoretical and experimental researches, especially single crystal
synthesis, are deserved.

In conclusion, we have pressurized and investigated the transport and
magnetic properties of the charge transferred superconductor
Eu₃Bi₂Si₂F₄. With T_(c)^(con) abruptly increasing from ∼1.5 to ∼10.0 K
in the pressure window 0.68 GPa  ≤ p≤ 1.00 GPa, and a crossover of
T_(c)^(11g)(p) from T_(c1)^(f) to T_(c2)^(f), the results demonstrate
that a new superconducting phase emerges at high pressures. The two SC
phases are phase-separated and coexist in the bulk sample. Hall effect
measurements also imply a significant difference in the electronic
structure between the two SC phases, highlighting the importance of
electron carrier density in the high-T_(c) phase. Our work devotes the
effort to establish the commonality of pressure effect on the BiS₂-based
superconductors, and calls on future detailed structural and theoretical
investigations on this new SC phase under pressure.
