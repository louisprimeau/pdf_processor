###### Abstract

We report the discovery of superconductivity in Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}Se_{5}, with an x-dependent superconducting transition temperature as high as T_{c}\simeq 2.1 K for x\simeq 0.7 (middle point of the resistive transition). Needelike single crystals display anisotropic upper-critical fields with an anisotropy \gamma=H_{c2}^{0}/H_{c2}^{\nu} as large as 6 between fields applied along their needle axis (or b axis) or along the a axis. As for the Fe based superconductors \gamma is temperature-dependent, suggesting that Nb_{2}Pd_{0.5}Se_{7} is a multiband superconductor. This is supported by band structure calculations which reveal a Fermi surface composed of quasi-one-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional sheets of hole character, as well as three-dimensional sheets of both hole and electron character. Remarkably, H_{c2}^{\nu} is observed to saturate at H_{c2}^{\nu}(T\to 0 K) \simeq 14.1 T which is 4.26\times H_{p} where H_{p} is the Pauli-limiting field in the weak-coupling regime. The synthesis procedure yields additional crystals belonging to the Nb_{2}Pd_{0.8}Se_{5} phase which also becomes superconducting when the fraction of Pd is varied. For both phases we find that superconductivity condenses out of an anomalous metallic state, i.e., displaying \partial\rho/\partial T<0 above T_{c} similarly to what is observed in the pseudogap phase of the underdoped cuprates. An anomalous metallic state, low-dimensionality, multiband character, extremely high and anisotropic H_{c2}'s are all ingredients for unconventional superconductivity.

## I Introduction

The Fe chalcogenide compounds, such as Fe_{1+\delta}Se, Fe_{1+\delta}Se_{x}Te_{1-x}, or the A_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} (A = Tl, Rb, or K) display remarkable superconducting properties. For example, the tetragonal phase of Fe_{1+\delta}Se (i.e., when 0.01\leqslant\delta\leqslant 0.04) displays superconductivity at T_{c}\sim 8.5 K only when \delta=0.01, [1] although it was recently shown that intercalation with Li_{x}(NH_{2})_{3}(NH_{3})_{1-y} or K leads to a dramatic enhancement in T_{c} up to 43 K [2] and 44 K, [3] respectively. For the Fe_{1+\delta}Se_{x}Te_{1-x} series, recent angle resolved photoemission studies suggest a ratio for the superconducting gap to the Fermi energy \Delta/e_{F}\approx 0.5, placing this system at the BCS to BEC crossover or, equivalently, that these are very strongly coupled superconductors. [4] Finally, the A_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} is claimed to be close to an orbital-dependent Mott transition [5] indicating a certain resemblance with the cuprates, although several studies support the microscopic coexistence of superconductivity with magnetism and concomitant insulating states. [6]

Recently, we reported the observation of superconductivity in yet another anisotropic, transition-metal based chalcogenide i.e., Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}S_{5}, which displays extremely large upper critical fields. [7] In contrast to the Fe chalcogenides, this compound crystallizes in the lower symmetry space group C2/m which, according to band structure calculations, leads to a complex Fermi surface (FS) composed of both two-dimensional (2D) and quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) sheets. The Pd stoichiometry is predicted to play a major role since the calculations indicate that it displaces the Fermi-level favoring nesting among the Q1D FS sheets for particular wave vectors, and this would lead to electronic instabilities and possibly to itinerant magnetism. [7] Therefore, the Pd fraction is expected to play a role similar to that of F or Co and K in the "1111" and "122"Fe arsenides, respectively, [8, 9, 10] where variations in their stoichiometry are observed to induce superconductivity or increase the superconducting transition temperature in detriment of antiferromagnetism.

Given its composition and electronic anisotropy, one could expect Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}S_{5} to display physical similarities with transition-metal dichalcogenides such as 2H-NbS_{2} or 1T-TaS_{2}, or some of the transition metal trichalcogenides such as NbSe_{3}. The former two compounds display a charge-density wave (CDW) transition followed by superconductivity at lower temperatures, [11, 12] while the latter displays two transitions towards CDW phases upon cooling. [15] However, we did not detect any sharp anomaly that could indicate a transition akin to a Peierls instability in Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}S_{5}; hence we have no evidence for the coexistence of superconductivity with a density-wave-like state which is claimed to enhance the superconducting upper-critical fields (H_{c2}) in the aforementioned compounds. [14] Furthermore, and despite the similar values of T_{c}, Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}S_{5} displays remarkably larger H_{c2}S (by a factor of 2 or more depending on orientation) when compared to either NbS_{2}[15] or NbSe_{2}[16] and, in contrast to both compounds, it also displays a clear concave down curvature in H_{c2}(T) for H\|b axis. These observations indicate few similarities between Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}S_{5} and the dichalcogenide or trichalcogenide compounds. In addition, as we will see below, the properties of the metallic state of compounds emerging from Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}S_{5} by replacing S with Se are non-Fermi liquid like in the region of temperatures just above T_{c} in contrast to the aforementioned compounds. This behavior is very prominent in a very narrow range of values for the fraction x of Pd, or when 0.67\leqslant x\leqslant 0.71, where one observes the emergence of superconductivity from the nonsuperconducting compounds.

In this paper, we show that different families of compounds can be created by varying the chemistry of Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}S_{5}, leading to superconducting compounds such as Nb_{2}Pd_{3}Se_{5} and Nb_{3}Pd_{4}Se_{7}. It turns out, as shown below, that Nb_{2}Pd_{4}Se_{5} for x\simeq 0.7 displays a crossover from metallic (\partial\rho/\partial T>0) to "nonmetallic" (\partial\rho/\partial T<0) upon cooling; therefore, we show that superconductivity in this compound emerges from  an anomalous metallic state. This crossoverlike temperature is observed to decrease as T_{c} increases (upon variation of x), with the metallic state displaying non-Fermi-liquid behavior as a function of the temperature, i.e., \rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{n} with n ranging from \sim1 to \sim0.4. In contrast, the Nb3Pd_{0.7}Se_{7} compound, with a middle point superconducting transition temperature T_{c}\simeq 2.1 K, displays Fermi-liquid-like metallic behavior (or n=2) above 150 K. Nevertheless, a mild anomaly centered around 110 K is observed in the resistivity, suggesting also a crossover or perhaps an electronic instability. Although in this compound T_{c} increases with x or the Pd content, the position of this anomaly remains unaffected by it. Similar to the Nb2Pd_{4}Se_{5} compounds, superconductivity in the Nb3Pd_{4}Se_{7} series also emerges from a state displaying nonmetallic character (or \partial\rho/\partial T<0).

For these chalcogenides, low dimensionality, multiband effects, anomalous metallic behavior, and as will be discussed below for the case of Nb3Pd_{0.7}Se_{7}, anisotropic and extremely high upper critical fields, suggest an unconventional superconducting state. Here, we focus on the superconducting phase diagram of Nb3Pd_{0.7}Se_{7}. A detailed account on the dependence of the superconducting phase diagrams of Nb2Pd_{4}Se_{5} and Nb3Pd_{x}Se_{7} on x or the Pd content will be given elsewhere.

## II Experiment

Nb3Pd_{0.7}Se_{7} was grown via a solid state reaction under an Ar atmosphere: Nb (99.99%), Pd (99.99%), and Se (99.999%) well mixed powders in the ratio of 4:1:10 were heated up to a peak temperature of 850 degC at a rate of 100 degC/h in sealed quartz ampoules, kept for 48 h and subsequently quenched to room temperature. The obtained single crystals formed thin long needles several millimeters in length, but with cross-sectional areas ranging from 1 x 5 \mum^{2} up to 20 x 100 \mum^{2}. The stoichiometric composition was determined by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and single-crystal x-ray structure refinement. Two distinct crystallographic phases were identified as resulting from the growth conditions, namely Nb3Pd_{4}Se_{7} and Nb2Pd_{x}Se_{5}, with 0.67 \leqslantx\leqslant 0.701 showing superconducting transition temperatures T_{c} ranging from T_{c}< 0.3 K up to \sim2.0 and \sim1.0 K, respectively. The detailed results of our refinements, including the respective atomic positions for typical single crystals of each phase, are given in the Appendix. A conventional four terminal configuration was used for the resistivity measurements which were performed under magnetic fields either by using a physical parameter measurements system (also for heat capacity measurements) or a superconducting magnet coupled to a dilution refrigerator.

Figures 1(a)-1(d) show the resistivity \rho normalized by its value at room temperature, i.e., \rho/\rho(T=300 K) as a function of the temperature (in a logarithmic scale) for five single crystals resulting from the same synthesis process. These crystals were analyzed through single-crystal x-ray diffraction measurements to reveal both their composition and their crystallographic structure. Traces in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) were obtained from crystals belonging to the Nb3Pd_{4}Se_{7} phase, whose Pd content x was refined as x=0.676(2) (blue trace), x=0.68(1) (green trace), and x=0.7025(22) (gray trace), respectively. The room temperature resistivity of these crystals was found to oscillate between several tenths of \mu\Omega cm to a few hundreds of \mu\Omega cm. This variability in the actual values of the resistivity can be attributed to the error bars in the determination of their geometrical factors, particularly their thickness which, for example, is approximately 1 \mum for the superconducting single crystal shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). As seen in the inset of Fig. 1(a), a broad anomaly is observed in the resistivity around T=100 K, indicating either an electronic phase transition akin to a spin-density wave state seen in the Fe-pnictide superconductors [17] or a crossover towards another electronic regime, such as the pseudogap observed in the cuprates. [18] Notice also that just above the superconducting transition \rho displays an uncharacteristic T dependence for a metal, i.e., with a negative \partial\rho/\partial T, indicating the existence of a prominent quasiparticle scattering mechanism. Red lines are fits to the power law \rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{n}, which yields exponents n ranging from 3.7 for the nonsuperconducting sample to 2 for the superconducting one, thus suggesting that the superconducting sample displays Fermi-liquid behavior already at high temperatures. The higher exponents for the nonsuperconducting samples result from the pronounced upturn in the resistivity observed around 110 K. The overall behavior seen in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), i.e., a pronounced change in slope at higher temperatures followed by an uncharacteristic nonmetallic like behavior at lower temperatures, is remarkably similar to what is seen in the underdoped regime of, for example, La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, [19] although the resistivity in those compounds follows a linear dependence on temperature at higher temperatures.

Figures 1(c) and 1(d) show \rho/\rho(T=300 K) for two Nb2Pd_{x}Se_{5} single crystals, i.e., respectively for x=0.7 and x=0.67 resulting from the same synthesis process. Notice the pronounced but progressive increase in resistivity below \sim100 K for the x=0.7 sample, suggesting again a continuous or second-order-like electronic phase transition or perhaps a crossover towards a pseudogaplike regime. Therefore, for _both_ compounds x=0.7 defines a threshold concentration separating superconducting from nonsuperconducting samples. Remarkably, while the increase in x beyond 0.7 induces superconductivity in Nb3Pd_{x}Se_{7} it is observed to _suppress_ superconductivity in Nb2Pd_{x}Se_{5}. This suggests that superconductivity is stabilized by small displacements of the Fermi level, or equivalently that in both compounds the Fermi level is located in close proximity to a van Hove singularity. For the Nb2Pd_{x}Se_{5} compounds, we found that the exponent in the power law describing \rho at high temperatures (150 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K) evolves from a value close to 1 when x\sim 0.7 to n\sim 0.5 in the superconducting samples (or when x\simeq 0.67) which corresponds to non-Fermi-liquid behavior, and cannot be easily ascribed to scattering by phonons. Furthermore, the superconducting transition for Nb3Pd_{0.67}Se_{5} is preceded by an upturn in the resistivity starting at T=48 K. Therefore, for both compounds and for 0.67\leqslant x\lesssim 0.7 superconductivity condenses out of an unconventional metallic state.

As discussed below as well as in Ref. [7], the geometry of the FS of these compounds is complex and contains quasi-one-dimensional sheets which are the necessary ingredient for a Peierls-like instability, which could lead to itinerant magnetism. The broad anomaly seen around 110 K in Nb3Pd_{0.7}S_{7} single crystals could correspond to evidence for such a transition and therefore in Fig. 2(a) we show the  magnetic susceptibility \chi as a function of the temperature for a batch containing hundreds of randomly oriented single crystals. We used hundreds of crystals, given that a typical individual single crystal, whose data are shown above, weighs only \sim1 \mug. We found that this particular batch is composed almost exclusively of crystals belonging to the Nb_{3}Pd_{4}Se_{7} phase. As seen, at higher temperatures \chi(T) varies little showing an unexpected linear dependence in temperature which could be an indication for Pauli-like susceptibility, but with a temperature-dependent density of states at the Fermi level. Around 110 K one observes just a mild deviation from linearity as indicated by the arrow; hence it does not represent a clear evidence for an electronic or magnetic phase transition. For T<50 K, \chi(T) displays a sharp upturn which, as seen in the inset, does not correspond to a Curie tail: the inset plots the inverse of \chi(T) in a limited temperature, i.e., for T<50 K, and as seen it is not linear in temperature. Consequently, this upturn cannot be attributed to the presence of impurities and most likely corresponds to evidence for magnetic correlations. A fit to a power law yields a very small exponent suggesting a -\log T divergence. Figure 2(b), on the other hand, shows the electronic contribution to the heat capacity C_{e} normalized by the temperature T, after the subtraction of a T^{3} term and for two values of the field, respectively, H=0 and 9 T. Again, hundreds of single crystals from one synthesis batch (\sim2 mg), therefore of varying stoichiometry, were used for these measurements. A broad anomaly in C_{e}/T emerges below \sim1.5 K and peaks at \sim0.7 K, with its width determined by the distribution of T_{e}'s, as seen in the upper panel. This anomaly is suppressed by the application of an external magnetic field, as expected for bulk superconductivity. Therefore, our observations clearly indicate bulk superconductivity. We emphasize that the data shown in Fig. 1 corresponds to crystals displaying among the highest T_{e}'s within the batches synthesized by us. In contrast, the heat capacity yields an average value for T_{e}.

Nb_{3}Pd_{0.7}Se_{7} crystallizes in the space group C2/m (see Fig. 3) and can be described as composed of sheets of a single Nb_{3}PdSe_{14} basic unit which is comprised of chains formed by square-planar and trigonal-prismatic Se polyhedra which are approximately centered by Pd and Nb atoms, respectively (see Ref. [20]). Each chain extends along the [010] direction (needle axis). The Pd(1) atoms center a column of face-to-face square planes. Both Nb(1) and Nb(2) atoms occupy chains of edge-sharing trigonal prisms, while the Nb(3) atoms occupy columns of face sharing trigonal prisms. The

The dimensions of the superconducting crystal are \sim1 \times 10^{-4}\times 8.5 \times 10^{-3}\times 0.2 cm^{-3}, leading to a room temperature resistivity of \sim70 \mu\Omega cm (for a contacts separation of \sim0.05 cm).

Notice a sharp anomaly at T^{\star}\sim 110 K which is independent on the Pd content x, but whose amplitude is seen to decrease as x increases. This anomaly of unknown origin is followed by a minimum in the resistivity at T_{\rm min}\sim 24 K, suggesting electronic localization preceding the superconducting transition. (c) and (d) Resistivity \rho/\rho(300 K) as a function of the temperature T for two Nb_{3}Pd_{4}Se_{5} single crystals, i.e., x=0.7 and 0.67, respectively. Notice the observation of an upturn in the resistivity at a Pd-dependent temperature, indicating again an interplay with some form of electron localization. The characteristic temperature T_{\rm min} below which \rho becomes nonmetallic decreases as the Pd content decreases. The dimensions of the Nb_{2}Pd_{0.67}Se_{5} single crystal are \sim1.75 \times 10^{-4}\times 3.4 \times 10^{-3}\times 0.235 cm^{-3}, leading to a room temperature resistivity of \sim225 \mu\Omega cm. Red lines are fits to the power-law behavior observed in the metallic state, which yield non-Fermi-liquid-like exponents n ranging from \sim1 (nonsuperconducting) to \sim0.4 (in superconducting samples).

  basic Nb_{6}PdSe_{14} is formed in such a way that the polyhedra in adjacent columns share their edges. The Nb_{6}PdSe_{14} layers form via interdigitation of the Nb_{6}PdSe_{14} units, with the Nb(3) atoms acquiring a seven-coordinate, monocapped trigonal-prismatic environment. The three-dimensional structure results from the stacking of these layers in a closed packed (Se atoms) fashion. The Pd(2) atom occupies a rhombic site between the layers and is square-planar coordinated with the Se(1) atoms.

Given the low crystallographic symmetry of Nb_{3}Pd_{0.7}Se_{7} one expects an anisotropic response for magnetic fields applied along its distinct crystallographic axis. Therefore, we

  show the resistivity of a second Nb_{3}Pd_{0.7}Se_{7} single crystal (T_{c}\simeq 1.8 K) for several temperatures and as a function of the magnetic field H applied along the a and the c axis [Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively] and for fields along the b or the needle axis [Fig. 4(c)]. This crystal was placed onto a sapphire substrate and the external field was initially applied perpendicular to the (b,c) plane [Fig. 4(a)]. Subsequently, the field was rotated by 90^{\circ} with respect to this previous orientation, while remaining perpendicular to the needle axis [Fig. 4(b)]. Subsequently, it was rotated by 90^{\circ} around the a axis in order to align the field along the b axis [Fig. 4(c)]. As seen, the resistive transitions from the superconducting to the metallic state for the different field orientations reveal rather anisotropic upper-critical fields H_{c2}.

## III Discussion

In Fig. 5, we display the resulting H_{c2}-T phase diagram, constructed by plotting the middle point of the resistive transitions shown in Fig. 4 as well as from the resistivity as a function of T under field (not shown). Remarkably, H_{c2} for fields along the b axis saturates at a value of H_{c2}(T\to 0 K) \sim 14.1 T, which is 4.26\times H_{p}[=1.84T_{c} (\simeq1.8 K)], where H_{p} is the Pauli limiting field in the weak coupling regime. To put this value in perspective, compare the ratio H_{c2}(T\to 0 K)/T_{c}=14.1 T/1.8 K = 7.83 with the corresponding ratios for Fe_{1+x}Se_{0.45}Te_{0.55} (\sim50 T/14 K \simeq 3.57)[21], CeCoIn_{5} (\sim12 T/2.3 K = 5.2)[22], and URu_{2}Si_{2} (\sim12.5 T/1.5 K = 8.33)[23] which, according to all evidence, are unconventional and strongly correlated superconductors. Notice that this ratio for Nb_{3}Pd_{0.7}Se_{5} also surpasses the respective one for Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}S_{5} (\sim37 T/6.6 K \simeq 5.6),[7] or for the Chevrel-phase PbMo_{6}S_{8} (\sim60 T/13.3 K \simeq 4.51)[24], and obviously the ratio for the widely used Nb_{3}Sn compound (\sim30 T/18 K \simeq 1.67)[25]. Finally, and although the anisotropy \gamma for Nb_{3}Pd_{0.7}Se_{7} is not as high as the one reported for Li_{0.9}Mo_{0.0}Ti, which suggests that this later compound is considerably more quasi-one-dimensional,[26] its ratio H_{c2}(T\to 0 K)/T_{c}\sim 15 T/2.2 K = 6.82 still is smaller than the ratio reported here.

Below we show Ginzburg-Landau fittings of the phase boundary, which for fields along the b axis yields an orbital limiting field H_{0}=(35\pm 3) T and H_{p}=(19\pm 1) T, therefore suggesting that Nb_{3}Pd_{0.7}Se_{7} could be a Pauli limited superconductor displaying a very large Maki parameter \alpha=\sqrt{2}H_{0}/H_{p}=2.6 if one uses both field values resulting from the fittings, or \alpha\simeq 3.5 if one uses the actual experimental result 14.1 T. In any case, these values for \alpha are >1.8, the value required for the observation of the Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinikov-state.[27] Below we also show a fit of H_{c2}^{b}(T) to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formalism,[28] indicating that a large \alpha value of \sim2.4 would fit the boundary, but would require a large spin-orbit coupling implying that this coupling is relevant for this system. Finally, as seen in the lower panel of Fig. 5, the superconducting anisotropy \gamma=H_{c2}^{b}/H_{c2}^{a} is T dependent as seen in the Fe pnictides/chalcogenides and interpreted as evidence for multiband effects.[29, 30]

In order to evaluate the contributions of both orbital and Pauli pair-breaking effects for all field orientations we analyze our H_{c2}(T) data at temperatures close to T_{c} where the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory yields[31]

\[\left(\frac{H}{H_{p}}\right)^{2}+\frac{H}{H_{o}}=1-\frac{T}{T_{c}}.\] (1)

Very close to the critical temperature, (T_{c}-T)/T_{c}\ll(H_{p}/H_{o})^{2}, the first paramagnetic term in the left-hand side is negligible and Eq. (1) yields the orbital linear Ginzburg-Landau temperature dependence, H_{c2}=H_{o}(1-T/T_{c}). At lower temperatures, (T_{c}-T)/T_{c}>(H_{p}/H_{o})^{2}, the Pauli limiting field H_{p} dominates the shape of H_{c2}(T)\propto(1-t)^{1/2} even in the GL domain if H_{p}<H_{o}. The latter inequality is equivalent to the condition that the Maki parameter \alpha\sim H_{o}/H_{p}>1 is large enough, assuring that the paramagnetic effects are essential. Shown in the upper panel of Fig. 6 are the log-log plots of our H_{c2}(T) as a function of 1-T/T_{c}, where the red lines are fits to Eq. (1). As seen for fields along the b axis (blue markers), the fitting yields H_{p}=(19\pm 0.5) T and H_{o}=(35\pm 3) T, respectively, implying a Maki parameter of 2.6 if one uses both values resulting from the fittings, or \alpha\simeq 3.5 if one used the experimental result 14.1 T as a tentative value for the Pauli limiting field. In any case, such large values for the paramagnetic limiting field relative to T_{c} would be difficult to understand for a conventional superconductor, suggesting either very strong correlations renormalizing H_{p} as seen in the heavy fermions, or an unconventional pairing mechanism, or

Blue markers depict the phase boundary for fields applied along the needle, or the b axis of the crystal. Brown and green markers depict the phase boundary for fields applied along the c axis and the a axis, respectively.

Notice that \gamma is temperature dependent as previously observed in multiband superconductors.

  both. For the other two orientations, one obtains similar values for both H_{p} and H_{o}. The lower panel of Fig. 6 shows a fit of H_{c2}^{b} normalized by the slope of its linear dependence at T_{c} and as a function of the reduced temperature T/T_{c}. Red line is a fit to the Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg formalism[28] with a tentative value of the Maki parameter \alpha=2.4, which yields an extremely large value for the spin-orbit coupling parameter \lambda_{\rm so}=100. Although it remains unclear how reliable such a large value is, this suggests that the spin-orbit coupling plays a relevant role for this system.

To shed some light about the possible superconducting pairing mechanism in Nb_{3}Pd_{0.7}Se_{5} we have performed band structure calculations to determine the geometry of the Fermi surface; the results are summarized in Fig. 7. Density functional theory calculations using wien2k[32] with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)[33] to the exchange correlation potential were employed to calculate the self-consistent energy eigenvalues at 16 000 k points in the reciprocal lattice. A doubled cell with one Pd(2) atom removed was used in order to achieve a formula unit of Nb_{6}Pd_{4.5}Se_{14}, resulting in band folding in the smaller reciprocal space cell. The FSs were calculated using the experimental lattice constants and atomic positions established in this work. The centering symmetry of space group no. 12 (C2/m) was eliminated so that half the Pd at the 2a Wyckoff position could be removed, resulting in a doubled unit cell with formula Nb_{6}Pd_{1.5}Se_{14}, i.e., with slightly more Pd than is incorporated experimentally. As seen in Figs. 7(c) and 7(d) the resulting FS is composed of quasi-2D sheets (maroon surfaces) of hole character, and a set of strongly and weakly warped Q1D (blue) sheets of hole character whose geometry is sensitive to the exact Pd content. The complex 3D network itself (golden) seen in Fig. 7(e) contains both hole- and electronlike orbits. Therefore, given that the resulting FS is composed of multiple sheets, having both electron and hole character, this system can indeed be classified as a multiband superconductor. Spin-polarized calculations show that a ferromagnetic state is stable, with a small moment attributable to some Nb atoms [0.27 \mu_{B}/Nb(1) and 0.20 \mu_{B}/Nb(2)] and a polarized, delocalized interstitial density. The stabilization energy is extremely small, and manipulable via variations in the Pd content indicating that the system is in proximity to magnetism. If a spin fluctuation mechanism were in play, T_{c} might be tunable by varying the stoichiometry as seen here.

## IV Summary

In summary, Nb_{3}Pd_{0.7}Se_{7} is a chalcogenide based multiband superconductor, displaying extremely large upper critical

(b) Same as in (a) but through a lateral perspective. Maroon and blue FS sheets are holelike, while the gold intersecting cylinders are electronlike in one direction and holelike in the other.

The Q1D surfaces are extremely sensitive to the Fermi energy, which is in turn sensitive to the exact Pd content.

  fields, i.e., comparable to those of unconventional strongly correlated heavy-fermion superconductors. The synthesis process also yields crystals of the Nb_{2}Pd_{4}Se_{5} phase, which also displays superconductivity. Both compounds display an anomalous metallic behavior, particularly for temperatures above their respective superconducting transitions which bears resemblances with the pseudogap phase of the cuprates. Such anomalous metallic behavior was not observed in Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}S_{5} which displays a considerably higher superconducting transition temperature.[7] This clearly indicates that the fraction x of Pd plays the role of a dopant, i.e., by varying its content one can, for instance, suppress nonmetallic states and stabilize superconductivity as observed in the Nb_{2}Pd_{4}Se_{5} series. Notice that this study was confined to a narrow range in x, from \sim0.67 to \gtrsim 0.7, where we have shown that small variations in x or \Delta x=0.03 easily suppress superconductivity in both families of compounds. Therefore, the overall behavior reported here for the Nb_{2}Pd_{4}Se_{5} series is clearly characteristic of an underdoped regime. As we already implied within the Introduction, an anomalous metallic behavior with broad anomalies, which cannot be clearly attributed to phase transitions and which instead suggests crossovers towards other electronic regimes, makes these compounds particularly distinct from the dichalcogenides or the trichalcogenides. Notice that, in quasi-one-dimensional or quasi-two-dimensional systems such as these, both charge-density waves[34] coupling to lattice distortions and spin-density waves[35] resulting from electronic correlations lead to sharp, first-order-like anomalies in their physical properties such as the resistivity,[36] in contrast to what is seen here. In fact, it would seem that these compounds are more akin to the Fe chalcogenide superconductors: for example, in the Fe_{1+y}Se_{x}Te_{1-x} series the resistivity in the metallic state is known to display a -\log T dependence above the superconducting transition which can be suppressed upon careful annealing.[21]

A complex Fermi surface composed also of quasi-one-dimensional sheets, interplay of superconductivity with an anomalous metallic state, and extremely high upper critical fields coupled to multiband behavior suggest an unconventional pairing symmetry.

###### Abstract

We report the discovery of superconductivity in Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}Se_{5}, with an x-dependent superconducting transition temperature as high as T_{c}\simeq 2.1 K for x\simeq 0.7 (middle point of the resistive transition). Needelike single crystals display anisotropic upper-critical fields with an anisotropy \gamma=H_{c2}^{0}/H_{c2}^{\nu} as large as 6 between fields applied along their needle axis (or b axis) or along the a axis. As for the Fe based superconductors \gamma is temperature-dependent, suggesting that Nb_{2}Pd_{0.5}Se_{7} is a multiband superconductor. This is supported by band structure calculations which reveal a Fermi surface composed of quasi-one-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional sheets of hole character, as well as three-dimensional sheets of both hole and electron character. Remarkably, H_{c2}^{\nu} is observed to saturate at H_{c2}^{\nu}(T\to 0 K) \simeq 14.1 T which is 4.26\times H_{p} where H_{p} is the Pauli-limiting field in the weak-coupling regime. The synthesis procedure yields additional crystals belonging to the Nb_{2}Pd_{0.8}Se_{5} phase which also becomes superconducting when the fraction of Pd is varied. For both phases we find that superconductivity condenses out of an anomalous metallic state, i.e., displaying \partial\rho/\partial T<0 above T_{c} similarly to what is observed in the pseudogap phase of the underdoped cuprates. An anomalous metallic state, low-dimensionality, multiband character, extremely high and anisotropic H_{c2}'s are all ingredients for unconventional superconductivity.

## I Introduction

The Fe chalcogenide compounds, such as Fe_{1+\delta}Se, Fe_{1+\delta}Se_{x}Te_{1-x}, or the A_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} (A = Tl, Rb, or K) display remarkable superconducting properties. For example, the tetragonal phase of Fe_{1+\delta}Se (i.e., when 0.01\leqslant\delta\leqslant 0.04) displays superconductivity at T_{c}\sim 8.5 K only when \delta=0.01, [1] although it was recently shown that intercalation with Li_{x}(NH_{2})_{3}(NH_{3})_{1-y} or K leads to a dramatic enhancement in T_{c} up to 43 K [2] and 44 K, [3] respectively. For the Fe_{1+\delta}Se_{x}Te_{1-x} series, recent angle resolved photoemission studies suggest a ratio for the superconducting gap to the Fermi energy \Delta/e_{F}\approx 0.5, placing this system at the BCS to BEC crossover or, equivalently, that these are very strongly coupled superconductors. [4] Finally, the A_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} is claimed to be close to an orbital-dependent Mott transition [5] indicating a certain resemblance with the cuprates, although several studies support the microscopic coexistence of superconductivity with magnetism and concomitant insulating states. [6]

Recently, we reported the observation of superconductivity in yet another anisotropic, transition-metal based chalcogenide i.e., Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}S_{5}, which displays extremely large upper critical fields. [7] In contrast to the Fe chalcogenides, this compound crystallizes in the lower symmetry space group C2/m which, according to band structure calculations, leads to a complex Fermi surface (FS) composed of both two-dimensional (2D) and quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) sheets. The Pd stoichiometry is predicted to play a major role since the calculations indicate that it displaces the Fermi-level favoring nesting among the Q1D FS sheets for particular wave vectors, and this would lead to electronic instabilities and possibly to itinerant magnetism. [7] Therefore, the Pd fraction is expected to play a role similar to that of F or Co and K in the "1111" and "122"Fe arsenides, respectively, [8, 9, 10] where variations in their stoichiometry are observed to induce superconductivity or increase the superconducting transition temperature in detriment of antiferromagnetism.

Given its composition and electronic anisotropy, one could expect Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}S_{5} to display physical similarities with transition-metal dichalcogenides such as 2H-NbS_{2} or 1T-TaS_{2}, or some of the transition metal trichalcogenides such as NbSe_{3}. The former two compounds display a charge-density wave (CDW) transition followed by superconductivity at lower temperatures, [11, 12] while the latter displays two transitions towards CDW phases upon cooling. [15] However, we did not detect any sharp anomaly that could indicate a transition akin to a Peierls instability in Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}S_{5}; hence we have no evidence for the coexistence of superconductivity with a density-wave-like state which is claimed to enhance the superconducting upper-critical fields (H_{c2}) in the aforementioned compounds. [14] Furthermore, and despite the similar values of T_{c}, Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}S_{5} displays remarkably larger H_{c2}S (by a factor of 2 or more depending on orientation) when compared to either NbS_{2}[15] or NbSe_{2}[16] and, in contrast to both compounds, it also displays a clear concave down curvature in H_{c2}(T) for H\|b axis. These observations indicate few similarities between Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}S_{5} and the dichalcogenide or trichalcogenide compounds. In addition, as we will see below, the properties of the metallic state of compounds emerging from Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}S_{5} by replacing S with Se are non-Fermi liquid like in the region of temperatures just above T_{c} in contrast to the aforementioned compounds. This behavior is very prominent in a very narrow range of values for the fraction x of Pd, or when 0.67\leqslant x\leqslant 0.71, where one observes the emergence of superconductivity from the nonsuperconducting compounds.

In this paper, we show that different families of compounds can be created by varying the chemistry of Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}S_{5}, leading to superconducting compounds such as Nb_{2}Pd_{3}Se_{5} and Nb_{3}Pd_{4}Se_{7}. It turns out, as shown below, that Nb_{2}Pd_{4}Se_{5} for x\simeq 0.7 displays a crossover from metallic (\partial\rho/\partial T>0) to "nonmetallic" (\partial\rho/\partial T<0) upon cooling; therefore, we show that superconductivity in this compound emerges from  an anomalous metallic state. This crossoverlike temperature is observed to decrease as T_{c} increases (upon variation of x), with the metallic state displaying non-Fermi-liquid behavior as a function of the temperature, i.e., \rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{n} with n ranging from \sim1 to \sim0.4. In contrast, the Nb3Pd_{0.7}Se_{7} compound, with a middle point superconducting transition temperature T_{c}\simeq 2.1 K, displays Fermi-liquid-like metallic behavior (or n=2) above 150 K. Nevertheless, a mild anomaly centered around 110 K is observed in the resistivity, suggesting also a crossover or perhaps an electronic instability. Although in this compound T_{c} increases with x or the Pd content, the position of this anomaly remains unaffected by it. Similar to the Nb2Pd_{4}Se_{5} compounds, superconductivity in the Nb3Pd_{4}Se_{7} series also emerges from a state displaying nonmetallic character (or \partial\rho/\partial T<0).

For these chalcogenides, low dimensionality, multiband effects, anomalous metallic behavior, and as will be discussed below for the case of Nb3Pd_{0.7}Se_{7}, anisotropic and extremely high upper critical fields, suggest an unconventional superconducting state. Here, we focus on the superconducting phase diagram of Nb3Pd_{0.7}Se_{7}. A detailed account on the dependence of the superconducting phase diagrams of Nb2Pd_{4}Se_{5} and Nb3Pd_{x}Se_{7} on x or the Pd content will be given elsewhere.

## II Experiment

Nb3Pd_{0.7}Se_{7} was grown via a solid state reaction under an Ar atmosphere: Nb (99.99%), Pd (99.99%), and Se (99.999%) well mixed powders in the ratio of 4:1:10 were heated up to a peak temperature of 850 degC at a rate of 100 degC/h in sealed quartz ampoules, kept for 48 h and subsequently quenched to room temperature. The obtained single crystals formed thin long needles several millimeters in length, but with cross-sectional areas ranging from 1 x 5 \mum^{2} up to 20 x 100 \mum^{2}. The stoichiometric composition was determined by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and single-crystal x-ray structure refinement. Two distinct crystallographic phases were identified as resulting from the growth conditions, namely Nb3Pd_{4}Se_{7} and Nb2Pd_{x}Se_{5}, with 0.67 \leqslantx\leqslant 0.701 showing superconducting transition temperatures T_{c} ranging from T_{c}< 0.3 K up to \sim2.0 and \sim1.0 K, respectively. The detailed results of our refinements, including the respective atomic positions for typical single crystals of each phase, are given in the Appendix. A conventional four terminal configuration was used for the resistivity measurements which were performed under magnetic fields either by using a physical parameter measurements system (also for heat capacity measurements) or a superconducting magnet coupled to a dilution refrigerator.

Figures 1(a)-1(d) show the resistivity \rho normalized by its value at room temperature, i.e., \rho/\rho(T=300 K) as a function of the temperature (in a logarithmic scale) for five single crystals resulting from the same synthesis process. These crystals were analyzed through single-crystal x-ray diffraction measurements to reveal both their composition and their crystallographic structure. Traces in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) were obtained from crystals belonging to the Nb3Pd_{4}Se_{7} phase, whose Pd content x was refined as x=0.676(2) (blue trace), x=0.68(1) (green trace), and x=0.7025(22) (gray trace), respectively. The room temperature resistivity of these crystals was found to oscillate between several tenths of \mu\Omega cm to a few hundreds of \mu\Omega cm. This variability in the actual values of the resistivity can be attributed to the error bars in the determination of their geometrical factors, particularly their thickness which, for example, is approximately 1 \mum for the superconducting single crystal shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). As seen in the inset of Fig. 1(a), a broad anomaly is observed in the resistivity around T=100 K, indicating either an electronic phase transition akin to a spin-density wave state seen in the Fe-pnictide superconductors [17] or a crossover towards another electronic regime, such as the pseudogap observed in the cuprates. [18] Notice also that just above the superconducting transition \rho displays an uncharacteristic T dependence for a metal, i.e., with a negative \partial\rho/\partial T, indicating the existence of a prominent quasiparticle scattering mechanism. Red lines are fits to the power law \rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{n}, which yields exponents n ranging from 3.7 for the nonsuperconducting sample to 2 for the superconducting one, thus suggesting that the superconducting sample displays Fermi-liquid behavior already at high temperatures. The higher exponents for the nonsuperconducting samples result from the pronounced upturn in the resistivity observed around 110 K. The overall behavior seen in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), i.e., a pronounced change in slope at higher temperatures followed by an uncharacteristic nonmetallic like behavior at lower temperatures, is remarkably similar to what is seen in the underdoped regime of, for example, La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, [19] although the resistivity in those compounds follows a linear dependence on temperature at higher temperatures.

Figures 1(c) and 1(d) show \rho/\rho(T=300 K) for two Nb2Pd_{x}Se_{5} single crystals, i.e., respectively for x=0.7 and x=0.67 resulting from the same synthesis process. Notice the pronounced but progressive increase in resistivity below \sim100 K for the x=0.7 sample, suggesting again a continuous or second-order-like electronic phase transition or perhaps a crossover towards a pseudogaplike regime. Therefore, for _both_ compounds x=0.7 defines a threshold concentration separating superconducting from nonsuperconducting samples. Remarkably, while the increase in x beyond 0.7 induces superconductivity in Nb3Pd_{x}Se_{7} it is observed to _suppress_ superconductivity in Nb2Pd_{x}Se_{5}. This suggests that superconductivity is stabilized by small displacements of the Fermi level, or equivalently that in both compounds the Fermi level is located in close proximity to a van Hove singularity. For the Nb2Pd_{x}Se_{5} compounds, we found that the exponent in the power law describing \rho at high temperatures (150 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K) evolves from a value close to 1 when x\sim 0.7 to n\sim 0.5 in the superconducting samples (or when x\simeq 0.67) which corresponds to non-Fermi-liquid behavior, and cannot be easily ascribed to scattering by phonons. Furthermore, the superconducting transition for Nb3Pd_{0.67}Se_{5} is preceded by an upturn in the resistivity starting at T=48 K. Therefore, for both compounds and for 0.67\leqslant x\lesssim 0.7 superconductivity condenses out of an unconventional metallic state.

As discussed below as well as in Ref. [7], the geometry of the FS of these compounds is complex and contains quasi-one-dimensional sheets which are the necessary ingredient for a Peierls-like instability, which could lead to itinerant magnetism. The broad anomaly seen around 110 K in Nb3Pd_{0.7}S_{7} single crystals could correspond to evidence for such a transition and therefore in Fig. 2(a) we show the  magnetic susceptibility \chi as a function of the temperature for a batch containing hundreds of randomly oriented single crystals. We used hundreds of crystals, given that a typical individual single crystal, whose data are shown above, weighs only \sim1 \mug. We found that this particular batch is composed almost exclusively of crystals belonging to the Nb_{3}Pd_{4}Se_{7} phase. As seen, at higher temperatures \chi(T) varies little showing an unexpected linear dependence in temperature which could be an indication for Pauli-like susceptibility, but with a temperature-dependent density of states at the Fermi level. Around 110 K one observes just a mild deviation from linearity as indicated by the arrow; hence it does not represent a clear evidence for an electronic or magnetic phase transition. For T<50 K, \chi(T) displays a sharp upturn which, as seen in the inset, does not correspond to a Curie tail: the inset plots the inverse of \chi(T) in a limited temperature, i.e., for T<50 K, and as seen it is not linear in temperature. Consequently, this upturn cannot be attributed to the presence of impurities and most likely corresponds to evidence for magnetic correlations. A fit to a power law yields a very small exponent suggesting a -\log T divergence. Figure 2(b), on the other hand, shows the electronic contribution to the heat capacity C_{e} normalized by the temperature T, after the subtraction of a T^{3} term and for two values of the field, respectively, H=0 and 9 T. Again, hundreds of single crystals from one synthesis batch (\sim2 mg), therefore of varying stoichiometry, were used for these measurements. A broad anomaly in C_{e}/T emerges below \sim1.5 K and peaks at \sim0.7 K, with its width determined by the distribution of T_{e}'s, as seen in the upper panel. This anomaly is suppressed by the application of an external magnetic field, as expected for bulk superconductivity. Therefore, our observations clearly indicate bulk superconductivity. We emphasize that the data shown in Fig. 1 corresponds to crystals displaying among the highest T_{e}'s within the batches synthesized by us. In contrast, the heat capacity yields an average value for T_{e}.

Nb_{3}Pd_{0.7}Se_{7} crystallizes in the space group C2/m (see Fig. 3) and can be described as composed of sheets of a single Nb_{3}PdSe_{14} basic unit which is comprised of chains formed by square-planar and trigonal-prismatic Se polyhedra which are approximately centered by Pd and Nb atoms, respectively (see Ref. [20]). Each chain extends along the [010] direction (needle axis). The Pd(1) atoms center a column of face-to-face square planes. Both Nb(1) and Nb(2) atoms occupy chains of edge-sharing trigonal prisms, while the Nb(3) atoms occupy columns of face sharing trigonal prisms. The

The dimensions of the superconducting crystal are \sim1 \times 10^{-4}\times 8.5 \times 10^{-3}\times 0.2 cm^{-3}, leading to a room temperature resistivity of \sim70 \mu\Omega cm (for a contacts separation of \sim0.05 cm).

Notice a sharp anomaly at T^{\star}\sim 110 K which is independent on the Pd content x, but whose amplitude is seen to decrease as x increases.

Notice the observation of an upturn in the resistivity at a Pd-dependent temperature, indicating again an interplay with some form of electron localization. The characteristic temperature T_{\rm min} below which \rho becomes nonmetallic decreases as the Pd content decreases. The dimensions of the Nb_{2}Pd_{0.67}Se_{5} single crystal are \sim1.75 \times 10^{-4}\times 3.4 \times 10^{-3}\times 0.235 cm^{-3}, leading to a room temperature resistivity of \sim225 \mu\Omega cm. Red lines are fits to the power-law behavior observed in the metallic state, which yield non-Fermi-liquid-like exponents n ranging from \sim1 (nonsuperconducting) to \sim0.4 (in superconducting samples).

  basic Nb_{6}PdSe_{14} is formed in such a way that the polyhedra in adjacent columns share their edges. The Nb_{6}PdSe_{14} layers form via interdigitation of the Nb_{6}PdSe_{14} units, with the Nb(3) atoms acquiring a seven-coordinate, monocapped trigonal-prismatic environment. The three-dimensional structure results from the stacking of these layers in a closed packed (Se atoms) fashion. The Pd(2) atom occupies a rhombic site between the layers and is square-planar coordinated with the Se(1) atoms.

Given the low crystallographic symmetry of Nb_{3}Pd_{0.7}Se_{7} one expects an anisotropic response for magnetic fields applied along its distinct crystallographic axis. Therefore, we

This crystal was placed onto a sapphire substrate and the external field was initially applied perpendicular to the (b,c) plane [Fig. 4(a)]. Subsequently, the field was rotated by 90^{\circ} with respect to this previous orientation, while remaining perpendicular to the needle axis [Fig. 4(b)]. Subsequently, it was rotated by 90^{\circ} around the a axis in order to align the field along the b axis [Fig. 4(c)]. As seen, the resistive transitions from the superconducting to the metallic state for the different field orientations reveal rather anisotropic upper-critical fields H_{c2}.

## III Discussion

In Fig. 5, we display the resulting H_{c2}-T phase diagram, constructed by plotting the middle point of the resistive transitions shown in Fig. 4 as well as from the resistivity as a function of T under field (not shown). Remarkably, H_{c2} for fields along the b axis saturates at a value of H_{c2}(T\to 0 K) \sim 14.1 T, which is 4.26\times H_{p}[=1.84T_{c} (\simeq1.8 K)], where H_{p} is the Pauli limiting field in the weak coupling regime. To put this value in perspective, compare the ratio H_{c2}(T\to 0 K)/T_{c}=14.1 T/1.8 K = 7.83 with the corresponding ratios for Fe_{1+x}Se_{0.45}Te_{0.55} (\sim50 T/14 K \simeq 3.57)[21], CeCoIn_{5} (\sim12 T/2.3 K = 5.2)[22], and URu_{2}Si_{2} (\sim12.5 T/1.5 K = 8.33)[23] which, according to all evidence, are unconventional and strongly correlated superconductors. Notice that this ratio for Nb_{3}Pd_{0.7}Se_{5} also surpasses the respective one for Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}S_{5} (\sim37 T/6.6 K \simeq 5.6),[7] or for the Chevrel-phase PbMo_{6}S_{8} (\sim60 T/13.3 K \simeq 4.51)[24], and obviously the ratio for the widely used Nb_{3}Sn compound (\sim30 T/18 K \simeq 1.67)[25]. Finally, and although the anisotropy \gamma for Nb_{3}Pd_{0.7}Se_{7} is not as high as the one reported for Li_{0.9}Mo_{0.0}Ti, which suggests that this later compound is considerably more quasi-one-dimensional,[26] its ratio H_{c2}(T\to 0 K)/T_{c}\sim 15 T/2.2 K = 6.82 still is smaller than the ratio reported here.

Below we show Ginzburg-Landau fittings of the phase boundary, which for fields along the b axis yields an orbital limiting field H_{0}=(35\pm 3) T and H_{p}=(19\pm 1) T, therefore suggesting that Nb_{3}Pd_{0.7}Se_{7} could be a Pauli limited superconductor displaying a very large Maki parameter \alpha=\sqrt{2}H_{0}/H_{p}=2.6 if one uses both field values resulting from the fittings, or \alpha\simeq 3.5 if one uses the actual experimental result 14.1 T. In any case, these values for \alpha are >1.8, the value required for the observation of the Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinikov-state.[27] Below we also show a fit of H_{c2}^{b}(T) to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formalism,[28] indicating that a large \alpha value of \sim2.4 would fit the boundary, but would require a large spin-orbit coupling implying that this coupling is relevant for this system. Finally, as seen in the lower panel of Fig. 5, the superconducting anisotropy \gamma=H_{c2}^{b}/H_{c2}^{a} is T dependent as seen in the Fe pnictides/chalcogenides and interpreted as evidence for multiband effects.[29, 30]

In order to evaluate the contributions of both orbital and Pauli pair-breaking effects for all field orientations we analyze our H_{c2}(T) data at temperatures close to T_{c} where the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory yields[31]

\[\left(\frac{H}{H_{p}}\right)^{2}+\frac{H}{H_{o}}=1-\frac{T}{T_{c}}.\] (1)

Very close to the critical temperature, (T_{c}-T)/T_{c}\ll(H_{p}/H_{o})^{2}, the first paramagnetic term in the left-hand side is negligible and Eq. (1) yields the orbital linear Ginzburg-Landau temperature dependence, H_{c2}=H_{o}(1-T/T_{c}). At lower temperatures, (T_{c}-T)/T_{c}>(H_{p}/H_{o})^{2}, the Pauli limiting field H_{p} dominates the shape of H_{c2}(T)\propto(1-t)^{1/2} even in the GL domain if H_{p}<H_{o}. The latter inequality is equivalent to the condition that the Maki parameter \alpha\sim H_{o}/H_{p}>1 is large enough, assuring that the paramagnetic effects are essential. Shown in the upper panel of Fig. 6 are the log-log plots of our H_{c2}(T) as a function of 1-T/T_{c}, where the red lines are fits to Eq. (1). As seen for fields along the b axis (blue markers), the fitting yields H_{p}=(19\pm 0.5) T and H_{o}=(35\pm 3) T, respectively, implying a Maki parameter of 2.6 if one uses both values resulting from the fittings, or \alpha\simeq 3.5 if one used the experimental result 14.1 T as a tentative value for the Pauli limiting field. In any case, such large values for the paramagnetic limiting field relative to T_{c} would be difficult to understand for a conventional superconductor, suggesting either very strong correlations renormalizing H_{p} as seen in the heavy fermions, or an unconventional pairing mechanism, or

Blue markers depict the phase boundary for fields applied along the needle, or the b axis of the crystal. Brown and green markers depict the phase boundary for fields applied along the c axis and the a axis, respectively.

  both. For the other two orientations, one obtains similar values for both H_{p} and H_{o}. The lower panel of Fig. 6 shows a fit of H_{c2}^{b} normalized by the slope of its linear dependence at T_{c} and as a function of the reduced temperature T/T_{c}. Red line is a fit to the Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg formalism[28] with a tentative value of the Maki parameter \alpha=2.4, which yields an extremely large value for the spin-orbit coupling parameter \lambda_{\rm so}=100. Although it remains unclear how reliable such a large value is, this suggests that the spin-orbit coupling plays a relevant role for this system.

To shed some light about the possible superconducting pairing mechanism in Nb_{3}Pd_{0.7}Se_{5} we have performed band structure calculations to determine the geometry of the Fermi surface; the results are summarized in Fig. 7. Density functional theory calculations using wien2k[32] with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)[33] to the exchange correlation potential were employed to calculate the self-consistent energy eigenvalues at 16 000 k points in the reciprocal lattice. A doubled cell with one Pd(2) atom removed was used in order to achieve a formula unit of Nb_{6}Pd_{4.5}Se_{14}, resulting in band folding in the smaller reciprocal space cell. The FSs were calculated using the experimental lattice constants and atomic positions established in this work. The centering symmetry of space group no. 12 (C2/m) was eliminated so that half the Pd at the 2a Wyckoff position could be removed, resulting in a doubled unit cell with formula Nb_{6}Pd_{1.5}Se_{14}, i.e., with slightly more Pd than is incorporated experimentally. As seen in Figs. 7(c) and 7(d) the resulting FS is composed of quasi-2D sheets (maroon surfaces) of hole character, and a set of strongly and weakly warped Q1D (blue) sheets of hole character whose geometry is sensitive to the exact Pd content. The complex 3D network itself (golden) seen in Fig. 7(e) contains both hole- and electronlike orbits. Therefore, given that the resulting FS is composed of multiple sheets, having both electron and hole character, this system can indeed be classified as a multiband superconductor. Spin-polarized calculations show that a ferromagnetic state is stable, with a small moment attributable to some Nb atoms [0.27 \mu_{B}/Nb(1) and 0.20 \mu_{B}/Nb(2)] and a polarized, delocalized interstitial density. The stabilization energy is extremely small, and manipulable via variations in the Pd content indicating that the system is in proximity to magnetism. If a spin fluctuation mechanism were in play, T_{c} might be tunable by varying the stoichiometry as seen here.

## IV Summary

In summary, Nb_{3}Pd_{0.7}Se_{7} is a chalcogenide based multiband superconductor, displaying extremely large upper critical

(b) Same as in (a) but through a lateral perspective. Maroon and blue FS sheets are holelike, while the gold intersecting cylinders are electronlike in one direction and holelike in the other. Notice that the FS is composed of both quasi-two-dimensional nearly cylindrical sheets as well as highly corrugated quasi-one-dimensional ones. The Q1D surfaces are extremely sensitive to the Fermi energy, which is in turn sensitive to the exact Pd content.

  fields, i.e., comparable to those of unconventional strongly correlated heavy-fermion superconductors. The synthesis process also yields crystals of the Nb_{2}Pd_{4}Se_{5} phase, which also displays superconductivity. Both compounds display an anomalous metallic behavior, particularly for temperatures above their respective superconducting transitions which bears resemblances with the pseudogap phase of the cuprates. Such anomalous metallic behavior was not observed in Nb_{2}Pd_{0.81}S_{5} which displays a considerably higher superconducting transition temperature.[7] This clearly indicates that the fraction x of Pd plays the role of a dopant, i.e., by varying its content one can, for instance, suppress nonmetallic states and stabilize superconductivity as observed in the Nb_{2}Pd_{4}Se_{5} series. Notice that this study was confined to a narrow range in x, from \sim0.67 to \gtrsim 0.7, where we have shown that small variations in x or \Delta x=0.03 easily suppress superconductivity in both families of compounds. Therefore, the overall behavior reported here for the Nb_{2}Pd_{4}Se_{5} series is clearly characteristic of an underdoped regime. As we already implied within the Introduction, an anomalous metallic behavior with broad anomalies, which cannot be clearly attributed to phase transitions and which instead suggests crossovers towards other electronic regimes, makes these compounds particularly distinct from the dichalcogenides or the trichalcogenides. Notice that, in quasi-one-dimensional or quasi-two-dimensional systems such as these, both charge-density waves[34] coupling to lattice distortions and spin-density waves[35] resulting from electronic correlations lead to sharp, first-order-like anomalies in their physical properties such as the resistivity,[36] in contrast to what is seen here. In fact, it would seem that these compounds are more akin to the Fe chalcogenide superconductors: for example, in the Fe_{1+y}Se_{x}Te_{1-x} series the resistivity in the metallic state is known to display a -\log T dependence above the superconducting transition which can be suppressed upon careful annealing.[21]

A complex Fermi surface composed also of quasi-one-dimensional sheets, interplay of superconductivity with an anomalous metallic state, and extremely high upper critical fields coupled to multiband behavior suggest an unconventional pairing symmetry.
