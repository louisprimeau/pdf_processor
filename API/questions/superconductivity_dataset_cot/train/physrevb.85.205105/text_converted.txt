###### Abstract

The first heavy fermion superconductor CeCu₂Si₂ has not revealed all its
striking mysteries yet. At high pressures, superconductivity is supposed
to be mediated by valence fluctuations, in contrast to ambient pressure,
where spin fluctuations most likely act as pairing glue. We have carried
out a multiprobe (electric transport, thermopower, a specific heat, Hall
and Nernst effects) experiment up to 7 GPa on a high-quality CeCu₂Si₂
single crystal. For the first time, the resistivity data make it
possible quantitatively to draw the valence crossover line within the
_p-T_ plane and to locate the critical end point at 4.5 ± 0.2 GPa and a
slightly negative temperature. In the same pressure region, remarkable
features have also been detected in the other physical properties,
presumably acting as further signatures of the Ce valence crossover and
the associated critical fluctuations: We observe maxima in the Hall and
Nernst effects and a sign change and a strong sensitivity on magnetic
field in the thermopower signal.

## I Introduction

Even though investigations started already in 1979,[1] CeCu₂Si₂ still
carries key enigmas of heavy fermion (HF) superconductivity (SC).
Numerous (pressure) studies on other Ce-based HF compounds, notably
concerning the 115 family, focus on the magnetic instability or magnetic
quantum critical point as a driving force for exotic behaviors such as
unconventional SC. However, in reference to the case of elementary Ce,
it is known that the Ce valence changes with pressure (delocalization of
the 4 f electron) and that this effect may also play a major role in the
determination of electronic properties. As a consequence, observations
in Ce compounds may result from a complex combination of different
underlying microscopic phenomena. In this respect, CeCu₂Si₂ may be a
good candidate to help to disentangle the contributions from the spin
and charge degrees of freedom, more intricate in other Ce systems (like
the 115 family). In particular, the pressure (_p_)-temperature (_T_)
phase diagram (Fig. 1) of CeCu₂Si₂ deviates from the "generic" one in
which SC emerges rather close to a magnetic instability, presumably
mediated by critical spin fluctuations (SF). Instead, in CeCu₂Si₂ the
superconducting region extends far beyond the magnetic quantum critical
point (located at p_(c) ≈ 0 GPa) and exhibits an enhanced transition
temperature (_T_c), culminating at ∼2.4 K around 4 GPa.[2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8] The most elaborate scenario [9, 10] invokes critical charge or
valence fluctuations (VF) associated with an underlying valence
transition (VT), that is, delocalization of the Ce 4 f electron when
tuning p across the critical region (_pV_). In elementary Ce (see inset
of Fig. 1), the first-order valence transition (FOVT) line (γ-α
transition), the location of its critical end point (CEP), and the
valence crossover (VCO) line have been unambiguously identified by
several experiments.[5, 11] In CeCu₂Si₂, obviously the CEP lies at much
lower T, where the electron delocalization is accompanied in the
transport data by a decrease in resistivity, in combination with SC at
the lowest T. Preceding experiments point toward distinct natures of the
two superconducting (sc) phases [9, 7] (related to p_(c) and p_(V),
respectively) and have unveiled close to _pV_ features peculiar to the
concept of critical VF, such as a _T_-linear resistivity and an
increased residual resistivity ρ₀.[2, 8] Despite such compelling
indications for the presence of critical VF in proximity to a CEP,
additional signatures of the putative VT are still highly desirable in
order to consolidate the decisive role of the 4 f electron
delocalization in the properties of CeCu₂Si₂ and accordingly in other
Ce-based compounds.

This challenge is strongly constrained by the necessity of both extreme
_and_ reliable conditions. Here we report on a _multiprobe_ experiment
under high pressure, sensing simultaneously electric resistivity ρ, Hall
ρ_(xy) and Nernst N effect, thermopower S, and ac specific heat C^(∞) on
the very same CeCu₂Si₂ single crystal. Based on the resistivity data, we
find that the VT is just missed in CeCu₂Si₂, with a CEP at slightly
negative T, and suggest a simple method to track the VCO within the
_p-T_ plane. More strikingly, it is possible to understand the complete
set of low T resistivity data as governed by the existence of the CEP
via a simple scaling analysis. In addition, anomalies in the p
dependence of ρ_(xy), S, and N close to _pV_ are uncovered and appear
intimately related to the Ce VCO.

## II Experiment and sample quality

The _multiprobe_ configuration [Fig. 2(a)] offers the unique possibility
to analyze complementary properties on the very same sample under
_uniform_ conditions. Multiprobing is particularly promising for
high-pressure studies, and in the case of delicate reproducibility. Of
course, it is impossible to probe all five quantities in an ideal
manner: Here the geometry has been optimized for ρ_(xy) and N (see Ref.
[13]). Figure 2(a) depicts the specifically designed setup within the
pyrophyllite gasket of our Bridgman-type tungsten carbide anvil pressure
cell.[14] Daphne oil 7373 is used as a p-transmitting medium, providing
a high level of hydrostaticity, as verified by the included Pb manometer
(p gradient of at most 0.1 GPa at 7 GPa). Either an electric current
[injected via the whole cross section of the sample by the wires labeled
I⁺ and I⁻ in Fig. 2(a)] or a thermal gradient (created via a resistive
heater) can be applied to the ab plane of the platelike CeCu₂Si₂ single
crystal (∼600 × 575 × 25 μm³, same batch as in Ref. [3]). As indicated
in Fig. 2(a), the magnetic field was aligned perpendicular to that
plane, along the c axis. EM dc nanovoltmeters model A14 were used to
probe the longitudinal and transverse electric fields, E_(x) and E_(y),
respectively. The T elevation ΔT with respect to the pressure clamp
(placed within a dilution refrigerator) is probed with an Au-AuFe
thermocouple [calibrated under magnetic field (H) in a separate
experiment]. For the C^(∞) measurements, the same lock-in-based
technique as described in Ref. [4] was used for the detection of the
amplitude of the periodic thermocouple voltage V^(∞), including separate
runs at low frequency to estimate the corresponding dc T elevation. The
typical working frequencies varied from about 10 Hz at ambient pressure
up to several 100 Hz at high pressures; no sc signal could be detected
down to the lowest T from 4.9 GPa onward. For the determination of the
thermoelectric power S = E_(x)/ − ∇_(x)T, we probed the longitudinal
field via two voltages, V_(Au) and V_(AuFe) [both compared to the
opposite longitudinal voltage lead, close to the negative current lead
I⁻ in Fig. 2(a)]. The Seebeck coefficient of the sample can then be
obtained from
$S=S_{\text{AuFe}}+\frac{S_{\text{AuFe}}-S_{\text{AuFe}}}{1-V_{\text{AuFe}}/V_{ \text{AuFe}}}$,
where S_(Au) can generally be neglected for T < 4.2 K. This procedure is
carried out for several heating currents (different ΔT) and then
extrapolated S(ΔT → 0), yielding S for a given cryostat T. The Nernst
signal N is defined as the transverse electric field generated by a
longitudinal T gradient in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic
field, N = E_(y)/ − ∇_(x)T ≃ V_(y)/ΔT. The N data were always
antisymmetrized with respect to H, and the sign was determined using the
common "vortex convention," yielding a positive N for moving
vortices.[13; 15; 16] Owing to the experimental configuration we measure
here the _adiabatic_ Nernst signal with a vanishing transverse heat
current, neglecting a possible transverse T gradient.[17]

Sample quality and characterization are particularly important in the
case of CeCu₂Si₂ because of its strong sensitivity on crystal growth
conditions and stoichiometry.[18] Here we summarize the key features of
our single crystal with the help of two figures (at ambient and under p)
comparing position, shape, and width of phase transitions as probed by
different physical properties in zero and under magnetic field. Figure
2(b) displays the H-T phase diagram at ambient p obtained from ρ, N, and
C^(∞). The high superconducting T_(c)(ρ = 0) = 780 mK goes along with a
remarkably low residual ρ(T_(c)⁺) = 8.3μΩ cm (see inset of Fig. 4). The
sample can be classified as of A/S type,[18] since the vanishing ρ(T)
coincides with a pronounced anomaly in C^(∞)(T), corresponding to the
antiferromagnetic Neel temperature T_(N) (as identified

results from Bruls _et al._ (Ref. [12]). (c) High sample homogeneity at

and under field in ρ(T), C^(∞)(T), and S(T) (lines are guides for the

the critical end point (CEP); the valence crossover (VCO) line (red) is
obtained from ρ(p) data and corresponds to that in Fig. 5(a). For
negative p, data (Ref. [2]) on CeCu₂Ge₂ were used for a qualitative
outline, and between 0 and 2 GPa the smooth interpolation is based on
Refs. [3] and [4]. See Sec. III.1 for more details, particularly
concerning the distinction between T_(c)^(onset) and T_(c)^(ρ = 0).

(Ref. [5])].

by its decoupling from T_(c) under magnetic field and by the associated
sign change of N, Ref. [13]. Under pressure, T_(N) is rapidly
suppressed,[19] and close to p_(V) [Fig. 2(c)] a high degree of
homogeneity is testified by simultaneous signatures in ρ(T), S(T), and
C^(∞)(T) of a _record_ superconducting T_(c)(H = 0) ∼ 2.4 K. These
outstanding sample characteristics, in particular the low residual
resistivity and the record _bulk_T_(c), constitute a solid basis for the
following data analysis, focused on the vicinity of p_(V).

## III Results and discussion

In the following, we expose and discuss one by one our results on the
different investigated physical properties. As a highlight, we display
in Fig. 3 (which we often refer to) the p dependence of the
superconducting T_(c)^(ρ = 0) and of ρ_(xy)(0.75 K, 8 T), S(2 K, 8 T),
and N(2 K, 8 T). A strong sensitivity of CeCu₂Si₂ to pressures around 4
GPa (∼p_(V)) is revealed, as will be developed further throughout this
communication. Most emphasis is put on our electric transport results,
since the improved data and sample quality allow us to go beyond
previous studies and address quantitatively features linked to the 4f
electron delocalization. Subsequently, the other multiprobe results will
be presented, partly consolidating already existing data, partly opening
unprecedented routes of exploration. Even if at this stage a deep
physical analysis may be premature in the latter case, this extensive
set of data which allows a direct comparison of five experimental probes
on the very same CeCu₂Si₂ single crystal under high pressure may be
worthwhile on its own and trigger further experimental and theoretical
investigations.

### _Resistivity_

#### iii.1.1 Comparison to previous results

The complete set of electric transport data ρ(T, p) is shown in Fig. 4.
All major characteristics are in line with previous reports,[2, 7, 8]
namely the extracted p dependence of the parameters ρ₀, A, and n,
obtained from simple fits to ρ(T ≤ 4.2 K, H = 0) = ρ₀ + A * T^(n). In
particular, from the inset of Fig. 4 at low T, three qualitative
features can already be distinguished by eye: As a function of
increasing p, the extrapolated residual resistivity ρ₀ increases before
a final downturn, the A coefficient drops dramatically at high p, and,
maybe less obvious, at 4.3 GPa n(p) has a minimum. The VF theory[8, 9]
predicts for a 4f electron delocalization realized at p = p_(V) a
maximum in the associated fluctuations at slightly lower p (p ≲ p_(V)),
coupled to n ∼ 1 and an enhancement in A and T_(c). Right at p = p_(V),
the impurity scattering cross section should rise strongly, leading to a
maximum in ρ₀(p). Beyond the delocalization (p > p_(V)), obviously a
deep loss of correlation effects is expected. These features are all in
good agreement with the experiment [Fig. 5(b)]: While A(p) and T_(c)(p)
culminate around 4 GPa, the extremum in ρ₀(p) points to a slightly
higher p_(V). Note that compared to previous studies, we do not only
observe a sudden drop in A(p) (revealing the loss of correlations), but
a preceding local maximum which coincides with that in T_(c)(p) [such a
signature of enhanced correlations close to p_(V) is in line with a
significant increase of the initial slope of the upper critical field
|dH_(c2)/dT|_(T = T_(c)) probed by C^(∞)(p → p_(V)); Fig. 5(b)].
Overall, these results corroborate the VF scenario in a general manner,
but do not allow to identify the CEP and the VT or VCO line.

iii.1.2 Isothermal p-dependence and 4f electron delocalization: Valence
crossover line and location of the CEP

In order to progress on this issue, we take advantage of the high sample
quality, and extend the previous analysis by simply plotting in Fig.
5(a) the p dependence ρ^(*)(p) = ρ − ρ₀ for several T ≤ 30 K (based on
our T scans from Fig. 4).

Figure 4: (Color online) Complete ρ(T, H = 0) scans for all 10
investigated p on a semilog scale. At p = 0, ρ(T) clearly exhibits two
separated maxima (merging at higher p), corresponding to the Kondo
coherence (T_(K) ∼ 10 K) and the crystal electric field (T_(CEF) ∼ 100
K) energy scales. These data served as a basis to obtain the p
dependencies shown in Fig. 5. [Inset (same symbols)] Magnification of
the low-T region for some selected p. Several features become obvious:
the increasing superconducting T_(c) and ρ₀ when reaching ∼4 GPa, the
almost T-linear resistivity at 4.3 GPa, and the collapse of the A
coefficient at highest p.

Figure 3: (Color online) p dependence of T_(c)^(ρ = 0),
ρ_(xy)(0.75 K, 8 T), S(2 K, 8 T), and N(2 K, 8 T) (lines are guides for
the eye). The maximum T_(c) is accompanied by a pronounced peak in N(p)
and a sign change in S(p), whereas the maximum in ρ_(xy)(p) occurs at
slightly higher p, more following ρ₀(p) [see Fig. 5(b)].

In the following, we want to carefully examine how the p-induced 4f
electron delocalization acts on the resistivity at various T. To
facilitate the comparison of the different curves, it is essential to
subtract the T-independent "background," that is, the contribution from
impurity scattering ρ₀(p), even if this procedure may introduce some
error bars due to the uncertainty on the determination of ρ₀ [of less
than the symbol size in Fig. 5(b)]. Note that the p dependence of ρ₀ is
not artificial at all, but can be well understood within the VF theory,
as pointed out above. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that up to ∼30 K the
phonon contribution remains negligible, as well as the influence of the
higher crystal electric field (CEF) levels. However, at higher T, the
situation may be less straightforward, particularly under p when the
ground-state degeneracy is affected by the crossing of the Kondo and CEF
energy scales (see also Fig. 4).

Let us now look in detail at Fig. 5(a): The initial decrease of ρ^(*)
with p can be explained with the increase of the coherence (Kondo)
energy scale (starting at ∼20 K at p = 0; see Fig. 4). Preceded by a
small upturn at low T, due to the enhanced A [Fig. 5(b)], ρ^(*)(p) drops
significantly above 4 GPa, indicating the Ce 4f electron delocalization.
This resistance loss takes place over a ∼4-times-order p range at 30 K
compared to 3 K. For illustration purposes only we have completed the
curves at higher T by data above 7 GPa [isolated points in Fig. 5(a)],
originating from a previous experiment [4] and reanalyzed in the same
manner as the present one. Although the overall behavior under p is very
similar, we do not include these older data in the further analysis to
avoid any ambiguity. The only purpose here is to document the
experimentally well-established fact that the delocalization
"terminates" with a low resistivity, even at 30 K. The observed
broadening of ρ(p) with increasing T is reminiscent of elementary Ce
[11] [see Fig. 6(b)], where the first-order discontinuity in
$\rho(p,T<T_{\rm cr})$ disappears when crossing the CEP
($T_{\rm cr}^{\rm Ce}\approx 480$K [5]; see inset of Fig. 1) and becomes
smoother and smoother within the VCO regime. However, in CeCu₂Si₂, the
situation is less straightforward: Below 30 K the scattering rate has a
strong T dependence. More quantitatively, in Ce the typical magnitude of
resistivity on the low p side varies by only ∼10

In any case, resistivity gets more sensitive to p for decreasing T,
consistent with the approach of a CEP, at which the resistance drop
should get vertical, like in elementary Ce. In order to locate the CEP,
we quantified the steepness of the resistance drop through its slope at
the midpoint [red squares in Figs. 5(a) and 6(a)],
$\chi=|d\rho_{\rm homm}/dp|_{p=p_{\rm VCO}}$, and analyzed its
divergence $\chi(T\to T_{\rm cr})$, as shown in Fig. 6(c). The error
bars take into account the uncertainty on p and that introduced via ρ₀
(mentioned above). A simple fit of the type
$\propto(T-T_{\rm cr})^{-\gamma}$ yields
$T_{\rm cr}^{\rm Ce_{4}Si_{2}}\cong-8\pm 3$K and γ ≅ 1 and a similar
treatment of the Ce data [17]$T_{\rm cr}^{\rm Ce}\cong 465$ K (in
agreement with more recent data [5]). Notice that experimental
limitations like sample imperfections or the inevitable p gradient tend
to broaden the resistivity drop, and hence the extracted $T_{\rm cr}$
may be slightly underestimated. In this respect, locally a FOVT

from the ρ(T) scans from Fig. 4 at selected T (lines are guides for the
eye). The ρ^(*)(p) curves decrease strongly above 4 GPa, within a p
range that gets narrower with decreasing T. The red open squares
indicate the 50

(slightly positive $T_{\rm cr}$) may not be excluded, so that density
fluctuations may mediate SC [20] via a vanishing compressibility (Ref.
[5], Ce case).

This basic analysis of the slope $\chi(T\to T_{\rm cr})$ establishes for
the first time experimentally that the CEP of the VT line in CeCu₂Si₂
lies at a slightly negative T. Even if some uncertainty on the precise
value remains–which is almost unavoidable in such a high-p
experiment–this outcome is more than just a qualitative result, in the
sense that it clearly specifies the (so far unknown) magnitude of
$T_{\rm cr}^{\rm CeCuSi_{2}}$ to be of the order of several degrees. It
substantiates that the FOVT is just missed in CeCu₂Si₂, meaning that
only a VCO is realized. Of course, electric transport on its own
constitutes only an indirect measure of the valence change. However,
recent reports [21, 22] based on more microscopic probes of the 4f
electron count and their qualitative conclusions on a possible VCO in
CeCu₂Si₂ under p corroborate our results and assumptions. Furthermore,
previous ρ data on the CeCu₂(Si_(1 − x)/Ge_(x))₂ system (shown in Fig. 4
of Ref. [23]) exhibit for x = 0.1 features qualitatively similar to
those presented here. Altogether, a consistent scenario emerges, in
which the key ingredient is the proximity of CeCu₂Si₂ at p_(V) to the
CEP. This constellation allows the associated critical VF to still play
an important role in the low-T physics, such as mediating SC, in very
close agreement to the already introduced VF theory [see, in particular,
the scenario outlined in Fig. 2(b) of Ref. [10]]. In this respect, our
results do not only specify the location of the CEP close to T = 0, but
offer also a simple method to track the VCO within the p-T plane:
Connecting the previously defined midpoints [red squares in Figs. 5(a)
and 6(a)], we obtain the red VCO line drawn in Fig. 1 [equivalent to
that in Fig. 5(a)]. As already mentioned, the precise pathway may
slightly depend on the normalization criteria. On this footing, the
minor downward curvature on the high-T side of the VCO line may be
somehow exaggerated: At 4 GPa and 30 K, resistivity obviously saturates,
approaching more or less the unitary limit. This means that the midpoint
should actually be situated at a marginally lower $p_{\rm VCO}$.
Regardless of this detail, and compared to the rather qualitative lines
in previous p-T phase diagrams, [23, 24, 25, 26] the present one is the
first signature of the 4f electron delocalization based on experiment.
Finally, extrapolating this line,
$p_{\rm cr}^{\rm CeCuSi_{2}}(=p_{V})\cong 4.5\pm 0.2$ GPa can be
deduced, so that both coordinates of the CEP are determined within the
experimental errors. Joining Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), it becomes obvious
that the extrapolation of the red VCO line roughly coincides with the
maximum in ρ₀(p), which is a good sign of consistency (within the
framework of the critical VF), since both features are triggered
precisely by the 4f electron delocalization.

#### iii.2.3 **Uniform behavior at a generalized distance from the CEP**

Next let us focus on an additional feature, revealing in a complementary
manner that resistivity is governed by the existence of an underlying
CEP. Strikingly, it is possible to collapse all the $\rho_{\rm norm}(p)$
data on a single curve in vicinity to $p_{\rm VCO}$. Introducing the
dimensionless variables $h=(p-p_{\rm VCO})/p_{\rm VCO}$ and
$\theta=(T-T_{\rm cr})/|T_{\rm cr}|$, a collapse of excellent quality is
obtained according to $\rho_{\rm norm}=f(h/\theta)$ (f, scaling
function) with $T_{\rm cr}\cong-8\pm 5$ K, as shown in Fig. 7 for
p ≥ 3.6 GPa. This means that for a generalized "distance" h/θ from the
CEP, the $\rho_{\rm norm}$ data behave in a unique manner. As indicated,
the sensitivity on the chosen $T_{\rm cr}$ is limited as well as the
number of data points, and the applicable p range may slightly vary
according to the normalization reference (see above). Nevertheless, the
data collapse is quite robust and its quality noteworthy, as well as the
fact that the extracted $T_{\rm cr}$ is of the same order of magnitude
as previously deduced from the T divergence of χ. We have also tried to
apply the universal scaling theory of critical phenomena, which has, for
example, been successful in describing the Mott transition probed by
ρ(p, T) in oxide materials [27] or in characterizing the valence
instability in Ce_(1 − x)Th_(x). [28] Within such a generalized
framework, the expected scaling law for $T>T_{\rm cr}$ yields
$\rho_{\rm norm}/h^{1/\delta}=f(h/\rho^{\gamma/\delta(-1)})$, with γ, δ
critical exponents (mean-field approach: $\gamma^{\rm MF}=1$,
$\delta^{\rm MF}=3$). In the case of CeCu₂Si₂ this leads empirically to
γ = 1 and δ → ∞ (Fig. 7). Even if the collapse is not strongly sensitive
on the choice of δ, it seems incompatible with δ < 5 and does hence not
correspond to a simple universality class such as the liquid-gas
transition. Further experiments with a higher

Figure 6: (Color online) (a) A simple way to demonstrate that
resistivity gets more sensitive to p with lowering T is to normalize by
the midpoint of the ρ^(*)(p) drop [identified by the red open squares in
Fig. 5(a)], compared to the initial value at 4 GPa, yielding
$\rho_{\rm norm}=[\rho^{*}-\rho^{*}(p_{\rm VCO})]/\rho^{*}(p_{\rm VCO})$
(lines are guides for the eye). (b) Original resistivity data (p scans
at fixed T) from Ref. [11] in elementary Ce. Below the CEP at 480 K,
ρ(p) exhibits a clear discontinuity at the first-order valence
transition (FOVT), whereas the ρ(p) curves get smoother for
$T>T_{\rm cr}$. (c) Divergence for $T\to T_{\rm cr}$ of the slope
$\chi=|d\rho_{\rm norm}/dp|_{p=p_{\rm VCO}}$, obtained from (a) (the
error bars take into account the uncertainty on p and that introduced

$T_{\rm cr}^{\rm CeCuSi_{2}}\sim-8$ K can be extracted. For Ce data
(Ref. [11]) a similar treatment yields $T_{\rm cr}^{\rm Ce}\sim 465$ K.

data density, also in related compounds, may help to better understand
this issue.

#### iii.2.4 General relevancy of ρ(p) analysis

Altogether, the divergence of the slope $\chi(T\to T_{\rm cr})$ and the
observed data collapse strongly suggest that the resistivity around
p_(V) is governed by the proximity to a CEP (at slightly negative T).
This outcome offers different avenues for future exploration. First, it
may be interesting to study on CeCu₂Si₂ single crystals of different
origin the involvement of critical VF in SC, that is the relationship
between T_(c) and $T_{\rm cr}$ (of course, other factors that influence
T_(c) have to be taken into account as well). Second, even more
promising, the widespread relevance of the VF scenario should be
investigated by applying a similar resistivity analysis to other
Ce-based compounds, especially to the more common cases where p_(c) and
p_(V) are not well separated. Indeed, the identification of p_(V) and
the 4 f electron delocalization is generally more elusive than that of
the breakdown of magnetism, p_(c), reflecting the competition between
the Kondo effect and the RKKY interaction. Rather exceptionally, in
CeCu₂Si₂p_(c) ≪ p_(V), and ρ(T, p = 0) exhibits two distinct
maxima/energy scales, as already noticed in Fig. 4 (T_(K) and
$T_{\rm CEF}$). Strikingly, close to p → p_(V) these maxima merge.
Although the microscopic link with the VCO may not be clear cut,
phenomenologically such merging maxima in resistivity can be found in
numerous other systems (like CePd₂Si₂/Ge₂,[29] CeRu₂Ge₂,[30] and
CeCu₈Au[31]), where the proximity to an underlying CEP may therefore be
revealed. However, in contrast to CeCu₂Si₂, in those systems both maxima
already overlap for p → p_(c). Hence, p_(c) ≲ p_(V) is suspected. The
latter scenario is also assumed in CeRhIn₅, mainly based on the
subsistence of SC in a wide region around p_(c), the maximum in ρ₀, and
a T-linear resistivity (n ∼ 1).[32, 33, 34] Using our method could be an
important ingredient for probing the existence of a CEP and the
relevancy of VF, notably for SC, in these compounds. Nonetheless,
another dissimilarity to CeCu₂Si₂ may occur: The resistance drop
associated with the delocalization may be less pronounced, which means
experimentally less accessible, due to a lower lying CEP (more negative
$T_{\rm cr}$). Concurrently, the impact of the critical VF on the
physical properties gets reduced. Previous experimental data in other Ce
systems (obtained mainly under less reliable conditions) may in some
cases (for example, in CeCu₂Ge₂[35, 36]) exhibit close to p_(V) features
qualitatively similar to those discussed here in CeCu₂Si₂, but do not
allow, so far, an incontrovertible quantitative analysis. New high p
experiments with improved accuracy will facilitate progress on this
explorative route. Let us finally add that in other systems like
CeIrIn₅[37, 38] or YbAg/AuCu₄[39, 40]p is replaced by magnetic field as
tuning parameter to induce the proximity to a CEP and critical VF.

#### iii.2.5 Broadening of the resistive transitions

Last but not least, let us comment on the broadening of the sc
transitions as seen by ρ(T) at intermediate and high p. The inset of
Fig. 4 exemplifies typical shapes of dropping resistivities at 2.59 and
5.53 GPa. In the p-T phase diagram (Fig. 1), we have represented two
lines delimiting the superconducting phase, one corresponding to the
onset temperature ($T_{c}^{\rm onset}$) and the other to ρ = 0
(T_(c)^(ρ = 0)). The resulting separation of both lines belowabovep_(V)
(in conjunction with narrow transitions at p = 0 and p_(V)) is robust
and found systematically in all CeCu₂Si₂ (and CeCu₂Ge₂) samples (already
mentioned in early reports[6]) and does not depend on the p conditions,
since it has been observed in a variety of pressure media,[2, 3, 7, 25,
2] among which in highly hydrostatic ⁴He. One may argue that broad
resistive transitions are quite common at the edges of superconducting
regions, but in CeCu₂Si₂, at intermediate p, the broadening appears
precisely in a region where the p dependence of T_(c) is rather weak.
For Fig. 1, between 0 and 2.15 GPa, older data[3, 4] served as a basis
for a smooth interpolation. $T_{c}^{\rm onset}(p)$ has already reached
the level of the maximum T_(c) at ∼2.5 GPa, but without a cusplike
feature as in previous reports.[7, 41] This rather quick increase of
$T_{c}^{\rm onset}(p)$ may point to the fact that the VF pairing
mechanism needs to be considered already at low p (at least in some
form), as already inferred from the very weak decrease of T_(c)(p) above
p_(c).[42] Around p_(V), the maximum $T_{c}^{\rm onset}$ and
T_(c)^(ρ = 0) coincide. Above p_(V), in several samples[3, 41, 43] the
superconducting region extends to high p; that is, the decrease of
$T_{c}^{\rm onset}(p>p_{V})$ is less steep than shown in Fig. 1, but may
exhibit a jump close to 8 GPa.[41] As a general feature, the bulk T_(c)
as probed by $C^{\rm ac}$ coincides with T_(c)^(ρ = 0). More precisely,
at intermediate p$C^{\rm ac}(T)$ does neither display any signature of
$T_{c}^{\rm onset}$ nor any notable broadening of the superconducting
anomaly associated with $T_{c}^{\rm bulk}\sim T_{c}^{\rho=0}$ (not
shown, but similar to reports in Refs. [4] and [7]). Remarkably, above
∼4.9 GPa, no more anomaly in $C^{\rm ac}(T)$ can be detected, down to
the lowest reachable T. In this context, it may be worthwhile to notice
that the T_(c)’s from Ref. [41] originate from ac susceptibility,
sensitive to a surface layer. Altogether, the broadening of the
resistive transition at intermediate and high p in CeCu₂Si₂ appears as
an _intrinsic_ phenomenon, even if details may be sample dependent.
However, the physical origin of this broadening remains an open
question. Further investigations are needed to elucidate whether it may
be related to the symmetry change of the sc order parameter (at least at
intermediate p),[19] to

$\rho_{\rm norm}(p)$ data [from Fig. 6(a)] as a function of the

critical phenomena (see text), such a representation corresponds to

phenomena observed in the Ce-115 series,[44] or more directly to the
presence of critical VF. Indeed, one could imagine a nonhomogeneous
nucleation and spread of superconducting domains within the sample or on
the surface, depending on the local distribution of $T_{\rm cr}$ and the
closeness to p_(V).

### Magnetoresistance

Let us now study the influence of magnetic field on resistivity, that
is, the magnetoresistance. First we stress that solely H-symmetrized
ρ(H) data are used in the following discussion, excluding any spurious
contribution from Hall effect, but strongly limiting the number of
available data points. Figure 8 displays the measured H and T
dependencies of the ratio ρ(H)/ρ(H = 0) for several p at 4.25 K and 8 T,
respectively. We preferred the representation of the relative value
ρ(H)/ρ(0) to the absolute value Δρ = ρ(H) − ρ(H = 0) (commonly called
magnetoresistance) because of the p dependence of the residual ρ₀. At
ambient p and for decreasing TΔρ changes sign from negative to positive
at around 4 K, as reported earlier[45] (at about 2 K in Ref. [46]). In a
simplified picture, the sign-change may be considered as a rough measure
of the coherence temperature $T_{\rm coh}$ of the Ce Kondo lattice
(generally $T_{\rm coh}\ll T_{K}$), as also indicated by the maximum in
the Hall data in the same T region (see Sec. III.4). However,
quantitatively we find a more pronounced ρ(H)/ρ(0) than measured back in
1987 (Ref. [45]): For example, at 1.5 K a linear interpolation yields
ρ(8T)/ρ(0) ∼ 1.15 [Fig. 8(b)], which corresponds to an increase of at
least a factor of 5, despite our very low ρ₀. Comparing crystals of
various quality (investigated by our group over the last 15 years or
so[3, 4]), the absolute magnetoresistance Δρ depends very little on ρ₀
at temperatures of a few K and a magnetic field of about 8 T. It looks
like as if resistivity had two contributions: one that is field
independent and varies strongly from sample to sample and another one
which always gives the same order of magnitude of Δρ in magnetic field.
This explains, at least phenomenologically, a considerable spread in
ρ(H)/ρ(0) on different samples. Next let us focus on the effect of p. At
4.25 K (Fig. 8), Δρ(p) first gets positive, in accordance with the
increase of T_(K) (and hence of $T_{\rm coh}$) with p. Surprisingly,
from ∼2 GPa onward [ρ(H)/ρ(0)](p) is almost constant, and continues to
rise only above p_(V), before likely reaching some saturation at high p.
Roughly, such a behavior is reminiscent of A(p), which drops with p,
except in the region before p_(V) [where it even gets enhanced; see Fig.
5(b)]. Conceivably, the effect of a raising T_(K)(p) [resulting in an
increasing [ρ(H)/ρ(0)](p)] is superimposed by another phenomenon, of
opposite effect and driven by critical VF below p_(V). Further
investigations are necessary to elucidate this question. Considering the
p evolution of ρ(8 T)/ρ(0)(T), we find another unexpected result: the
extrapolation for T → 0 seems to point to an almost p-independent
ρ(8 T)/ρ(0) of about 1.35: The higher values of ρ(H)/ρ(0) at finite T
are "compensated" by a weaker T dependence for increasing p. Of course,
more data points at low T would be needed, especially around p_(V), to
confirm this trend. Less intriguingly, ρ(H)/ρ(0) clearly follows the
usual H² dependence at low fields, as exemplified in Fig. 8(a) for 6.8
GPa. Another standard examination is provided by the validity check of
Kohler’s rule. It states that the effect of magnetic field on
resistivity, Δρ(H)/ρ(0), scales as a function of H/ρ(0).[47] Deviations
from this standard behavior are also observed, for example, in CeRhIn₅,
where magnetoresistance violates Kohler’s rule in the p region
exhibiting prominent non-Fermi liquid properties, but satisfies a
modified scaling relation.[48] From our partial analysis (not shown) on
CeCu₂Si₂, no significant deviation from Kohler’s rule throughout the
investigated p range can be deduced. However, this preliminary statement
still requires substantiation from supplementary data, especially at
high p where ρ(T < 4 K) hardly varies, meaning that data points above 4
K should be included in order to perform the test on a broad parameter
range.

### Specific heat (ac)

Concerning ac specific heat, its main contribution, apart from
validating bulk SC, is to confirm for the first time the enhancement of
correlation effects near the maximum T_(c) by a bulk probe, at least
when considering that the initial slope |dH_(c2)/dT|_(T = T_(c))
qualitatively reflects the quasiparticle velocity or effective mass as a
correlation strength sensor. Indeed, an enhancement by a factor of ∼3 of
the initial slope at the maximum T_(c) compared to 2 GPa is observed
[solid triangles in Fig. 5(b)]. As mentioned earlier, such a trend had
already been inferred from resistivity and a kind of "plateau" in
A(p ∼ 4 GPa),[2, 7, 8] which has now grown into a clear maximum in the
present high-quality single crystal [Fig. 5(b)]. More specifically, one
may also be interested in the p evolution of the properties of the
superconducting phase itself, which is in part characterized by the
H_(c2)(T) curves. Without pushing the analysis too far, we just present
our new H_(c2)(T) data that allow an extension up to p_(V) of a scaling
study suggested by Lengyel _et al.[19]_ (restricted to p < 2.1 GPa).
Figure 9 depicts the corresponding normalized H/T_(c)-T/T_(c) phase
diagram, including the data from Ref. [19]. For p ∼ 0 (ρ data) and p ∼ 2
GPa the trend of two distinct regimes is confirmed, that is, a ratio of
the initial slopes |dH_(c2)/dT|_(T = T_(c)) of roughly 1.75 (Ref. [19]).
However, for p → p_(V), the initial slope

Figure 8: (Color online) (a) H dependence of the ratio ρ(H)/ρ(H = 0) for
various p at 4.25 K. At ambient p, in more usual terms the
magnetoresistance Δρ[ = ρ(H) − ρ(H = 0)] is slightly negative, becomes
positive for p > 0, but without any significant evolution between 2 and
4 GPa, and finally increases further. Just for comparison, a curve ∝∝H²
is also shown as dash-dotted line. (b) T dependence of the ratio
ρ(8 T)/ρ(H = 0) for various p. The points at the right correspond to

eye only).

rises again (to even higher values than at p = 0, see above). It hence
appears questionable whether the behavior at only ∼2 GPa is
representative of the critical VF regime, as implied by the presumed
symmetry change of the superconducting order parameter.[19] On the
present data basis, a further evolution with increasing p toward p_(V)
cannot be excluded. For sure, the robustness against H is first lowered
by p and then rises again for 2 GPa  < p ≲ p_(V). This trend is
supported by an anterior report from Vargoz _et al._[3] on a crystal of
the same batch (original ρ data represented by red and dark blue lines
in Fig. 9), where the initial slopes for p ∼ 0 and p ∼ p_(V) roughly
match. Notice that the Pauli limiting field (T → 0) seems slightly
weakened for p → p_(V), pointing to an increasing g factor.[5] Finally,
the evolution with p of the superconducting order parameter symmetry may
be easier tracked by angle-dependent measurements.

### Transverse resistivity: Hall effect

In Fig. 10 we display the T dependence of the transverse resistivity
(Hall effect) ρ_(xy)(T) at 8 T and for several p up to 6.8 GPa (data
systematically antisymmetrized with respect to H), the H dependence
ρ_(xy)(H) is exemplified at ∼4 GPa in Fig. 13(a) for different T. At
p = 0 the measured T dependence is roughly in line with the
literature[46; 49; 50] (except for the sign compared to Ref. [46]) with
a maximum at ∼2 K, possibly pointing to the $T_{\rm coh}$ energy scale,
comparable to that inferred from magnetoresistance data (see above). For
a precise analysis of the ordinary and the anomalous contribution due to
skew scattering, data above 4 K would be necessary and should be
compared to magnetic susceptibility measurements.[50; 51] This is
particularly true for higher p, where we did not reach the maximum in
ρ_(xy)(T), shifted to T > 4 K (Ref. [50]) and following the increase of
T_(K) (and hence of $T_{\rm coh}$) with p [see the p shift of the
maximum in ρ(T) (Fig. 4)]. Here we report for the first time on a
CeCu₂Si₂ single crystal the p dependence of ρ_(xy) at low T and across
the region of the 4f electron delocalization, where it exhibits a
prominent maximum (Fig. 3). Its position does not depend on the
extraction from high or low field data, due to an almost H-linear Hall
voltage [Fig. 13(a)]; its value is about one order of magnitude higher
than that of LaCu₂Si₂ (Ref. [52]). As can easily be deduced from Fig. 10
the strongest Hall signal corresponds to 4.3 and 4.9 GPa, depending on
the T range; below 1 K the maximum in ρ_(xy)(p) clearly lies beyond that
of T_(c)(p), as shown in Fig. 3 at 0.75 K and 8 T. This shift points to
a Hall signal more sensitive to the VCO itself, mimicking ρ₀(p).[9] In
contrast, the _maxima_ in T_(c)(p) and A(p) rather appear for p ≲ p_(V),
the domain of strongest VF[9] (see above). For p > p_(V), the decrease
of ρ_(xy)(p) is quite steep, like that of T_(c)(p) or A(p), reflecting
the departure from the critical region. The T dependence ρ_(xy)(T → 0)
also clearly changes over the whole p range [from positive curvature
over T linear at p_(V) toward almost T independent (Fig. 10)].
Interestingly, an enhancement of ρ_(xy) at low T is also reported in
CeRhIn₅ close to the critical pressure p_(c) ∼ p_(V) and discussed in
the light of the backflow effect in strongly correlated materials.[48]
Further calculations within the critical VF scenario are currently
carried out and may connect on a microscopic basis the observed increase
of ρ_(xy)(p) in vicinity of p_(V) with the 4f electron delocalization
and the proximity to the CEP in CeCu₂Si₂.

### Thermoelectric properties I: Thermopower

Let us now concentrate on the thermoelectric properties, S and N.
Starting with the (longitudinal) thermopower (Seebeck coefficient), our
data [Figs. 3, 11, and 14(a)-14(c)] generally

Figure 10: (Color online) T-dependence of the transverse resistivity
(Hall signal) $\rho_{xy}(8\,\rm{T})$ at several p up to 6.8 GPa. At
p = 0 a maximum is observed around 2 K, possibly reflecting the
$T_{\rm coh}$ energy scale. With increasing p and at low T, the positive
curvature evolves subsequently into a T-linear and a T-independent
behavior, whereas ρ_(xy)(T → 0) appears maximum at a p slightly above
p_(V) (displayed in Fig. 3), similar to ρ₀(p) [Fig. 5(b)] (lines are
guides for the eye only).

Figure 9: (Color online) Normalized H_(c2)(T) data from C^(∞) (except
p = 0: from ρ). Distinct behaviors for p = 0 and ∼2 GPa are confirmed
compared to a specific heat study by Lengyel _et al._ (Ref. [19]), but
around p_(V) another regime appears, with an initial slope
|dH_(c2)/dT|_(T = T_(c)) closer to that at p = 0 [see also Fig. 5(b)].
Previous resistivity data from Vargoz _et al._ (Ref. [3]), available for
p = 0 and p_(V) for a sample of the same batch, confirm this latest
trend. (Inse) Example of raw data (inverse of the thermocouple voltage)
under field at 4.3 GPa, used to determine the different H-T phase
diagrams. Note that for p ≥ 4.9 GPa no superconducting anomaly is
detected by C^(∞) down to 0.1 K.

agree with previous reports,[6, 46, 53] except that at p = 0 we obtain a
slightly smaller signal from the A phase (not shown) compared to Ref.
[53]. Apart from this small positive contribution below 1 K, the
thermopower signal is negative, before getting positive around 70 K with
a subsequent maximum at about 150 K, Ref. [6]. Even if a generic
behavior is absent in the thermoelectric response of HF materials, it
seems to be more or less characteristic[54, 55, 56] for Ce compounds
close to the magnetic instability that at low T a negative contribution
competes with the more ordinary positive contribution (related to the
T_(K) and $T_{\rm{CEF}}$ energy scales) to S. Hence, a reduction of this
negative component is expected when p is applied, since an increasing
hybridization generally favors the nonmagnetic HF Kondo lattice state
(screened 4f electrons), eventually followed by a mixed valence state.
This phenomenon has already been observed experimentally[6] on a broad T
scale up to 300 K and 8 GPa, demonstrating the continuous decrease and
subsequent vanishing of the negative component. Here we concentrate on
the low-T region, for the first time in the presence of a magnetic field
(to avoid the superconducting shunt). As a key feature,
$S(p,2\,{\rm K},8\,{\rm T})$ changes sign precisely in the region where
T_(c)(p) and A(p) are maximum [see Figs. 3 and 5(b)]: Like in a naive
picture, S(p) seems related to the derivative of the density of states.
Whether this sign-change of thermopower is intimately coupled to the 4f
electron delocalization, or occurs rather accidentally in this p region,
is left for further studies. In particular, future band structure
calculations or Fermi surface investigations under p may help to better
identify the role of the VCO for the intriguing behavior of S(p, T, H).
Close to 6 GPa, $S(p,2\,{\rm K},8\,{\rm T})$ finally has a maximum
itself (Fig. 3), the downturn occurring only at the highest examined p.
Surprisingly, our results seem not compatible with previous
systematics,[57] which would expect S/T(T → 0) ∼ N_(A)e/γ, where
$N_{A}e=9.6\times 10^{5}\,{\rm C}\,{\rm mol}^{-1}$ is the Faraday number
and γ the Sommerfeld coefficient of specific heat. From our data in the
vicinity of p_(V), S remains negative down to the lowest available T
(for H ≠ 0), except for $p>5\,{\rm GPa}$. Possibly, positive values are
recovered at much lower T, since the characteristic energy scale of the
system may be markedly reduced around p_(V). On the same footing, the
Seebeck coefficient displays a strong H dependence in the vicinity of
p_(V), in contrast to lower and higher p, as shown in Figs. 14(a)-14(c).
The difference in the sensitivity on magnetic field is particularly
striking between 4 GPa with |S(8T) − S(0T)|/S(0T) ∼ 1.75 at 3 K Fig.
14(b)] and the H-independent S(T) at 6.8 GPa [Fig. 14(c)]. The
observation of such a feature in S(H) close to a valence instability
clearly points to a low characteristic energy scale and a peculiar
behavior around p_(V), as mentioned above; however, its physical origin
may be difficult to unveil independently from other probes since it
involves both transport and thermodynamic properties of the system.

### Thermoelectric properties II: Nernst effect

Last but not least let us comment on the transverse thermoelectric
voltage in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field, the Nernst
effect [Figs. 3, 12, and 13(b)]. In a semiclassical, single-band
Boltzmann picture, the quasiparticle contribution to the Nernst signal
relies on the energy dependence of the relaxation time.[58, 59] Indeed,
the appearance of a transverse electric field has its origin in the
different relaxation times of the charge carriers involved in the heat
current (induced by the applied T gradient) and the charge carriers
responsible of the compensating counterflow. In ordinary metals, the
relaxation time depends only weakly on energy, so that the Nernst signal
is usually quite small (so-called Sondheimer cancellation[60]). Assuming
a linear energy dependence around the Fermi level, a simplified
expression for the Nernst coefficient υ = N/B can be found[59]:
$\upsilon/T=\frac{\pi^{2}k_{B}}{3\kappa}(=283\;[\mu{\rm V/K}])\cdot\frac{\mu} {E_{F}/k_{B}}$
(μ: carrier mobility). Hence, a high mobility or a low Fermi energy can
naturally lead to an enhanced Nernst signal, the latter case being often

Figure 11: (Color online) T dependence of the thermoelectric power
$S(8{\rm T})$ at several p up to 6.8 GPa. Remarkably, a sign change from
negative to positive takes place around 4 GPa within the entire
investigated T range. For $0<p<5\,{\rm GPa}$, $S(8\,{\rm T})$ remains
negative down to the lowest available T. The p-dependent sensitivity on
magnetic field is displayed in Figs. 14(a)–14(c) (lines are guides for
the eye only).

Figure 12: (Color online) T dependence of the Nernst signal N(8 T) at
several p up to 6.8 GPa. As a function of p, the Nernst signal first
increases, with a maximum at 4 GPa (see Fig. 3), before decreasing again
and even switching to negative values at high p. Below 5 GPa, a
characteristic energy scale may be revealed through the maximum in N(T)
around 2 K (lines are guides for the eye only).

realized in HF compounds,[59] for example, in CeCoIn₅ (Refs. [61; 62;
63]). However, in CeCu₂Si₂ at ambient p, we only observe a tiny
N < 0.2μV/K at low T and under 8 T (Fig. 12 and Ref. [13]). A sign
change is observed below 1 K, likely related to the A phase, and around
4 K, like in magnetoresistance. Here we are particularly interested in a
possible signature of the 4f electron delocalization around p_(V). In
this respect, as a function of p, the most intriguing feature is a
strong enhancement toward p_(V), leading to a pronounced peak that
coincides with the maximum in T_(c)(p) (Figs. 3 and 12). Its value is
more than one order of magnitude higher than at p = 0 and roughly
corresponds to half of the giant N measured in CeCoIn₅.[61] In addition,
N(T) exhibits a maximum around 2 K for p < 5 GPa and independent of H,
most likely revealing a characteristic energy scale (Fig. 12). For
p ∼ p_(V), this assumption is reinforced by a negative peak also around
2 K in S(T, H ≠ 0) (Fig. 11). For p > p_(V), N behaves in a more
"conventional" manner (smaller values, roughly T linear), and it changes
sign to negative. Let us add that generally a H-linear Nernst voltage is
observed, as exemplified at 4 GPa in Fig. 13(b). We have also
investigated the above relationship between v/T and
$\frac{\mu}{E_{F}/k_{B}}$ in the low-T limit[69] (note that solely rough
estimations for E_(F) are available): CeCu₂Si₂ approaches the universal
curve only at p_(V), next to CeRu₂Si₂ (which may not be surprising since
transport data show similarities[64]). However, away from p_(V)
(especially for p → 0), the tiny N inevitably drives the corresponding
data quite off the universal line, yielding a slope different from
283[μV/K].

Apart from the quasiparticles, moving vortices in the mixed phase of a
superconductor can also give rise to a transverse voltage,[65; 66] which
is directly related to their velocity. This phenomenon has been
extensively studied in the high-T_(c) superconductors, known to exhibit
a strong enhancement of N in the vortex-liquid state.[15; 67; 68] In
contrast, no sizable vortex contribution to N has yet been detected in
HF systems (see, for example, Ref. [61]); that is, the vortices are
assumed to be immobile. CeCu₂Si₂ does not deviate from this trend. In
Fig. 13(c) we compare the field dependence of the Nernst signal in NCCO
(from Ref. [15]) and CeCu₂Si₂ at a similar ratio of
T/T_(c)^(H = 0) ∼ 0.8 (the T → 0 limit of H_(c2) is of the same order of
magnitude in both compounds). While in CeCu₂Si₂N(H) simply follows the
vanishing ρ(H) [taking into account the applied thermal gradient of 5

Figure 13: (Color online) (a) H dependence of the Hall signal ρ_(xy) at
different T and 3.95 GPa; minor deviations from a linear behavior appear
only at high fields. (b) Almost linear H dependence of the Nernst signal
N at different T and 3.95 GPa. (c) Contrasting field dependence N(H) in
NCCO (from Ref. [15]) and CeCu₂Si₂ (3.95 GPa) at comparable T/T_(c0) and
H_(c2). While a strong contribution from moving vortices leads to an
increase of $N_{\rm NCCO}$ below H_(c2), $N_{\rm CeCu_{2}Si_{2}}(H)$
simply follows ρ(H) and vanishes. (d) The typical transition width of
N(H) at H_(c2) roughly corresponds to the applied thermal gradient of 5

Another interesting feature appears when comparing the magnetothermal
electric fields E_(x) (longitudinal, probed by S) and E_(y) (transverse,
probed by N) [see Fig. 2(a)]. For some specific points in the T-p-H
space, particularly in vicinity to p_(V) and under high magnetic field,
E_(x) vanishes (sign change as already discussed above), whereas the
transverse field E_(y) stays finite. Such a situation is exemplified at
2.5 K and 8 T in Fig. 14(d), where the ratio $N/S(=\tan\theta_{\rm TE})$
diverges as a function of p around 4 GPa, and it is also seen in the T
dependence of N/S, shown at 4 GPa in Fig. 14(e). In other words, the
electric field produced by a longitudinal heat current becomes
exclusively transverse. Whether this happens accidentally and is simply
related to the fact that S and N probe quite different phenomena in a
complex multiband system evolving under p, or whether the orthogonal
electric field occurs for more profound reasons, possibly linked to the
4f electron delocalization at p_(V), is left for further studies. At
this stage, we can only make the following comments: A similar trend has
been reported in CeCoIn₃ in the low-H and -T limit [61] (but it is
partly masked by SC). There a strongly energy-dependent elastic
scattering rate had been invoked to explain the low Seebeck and large
Nernst coefficients. Returning back to CeCu₂Si₂, in contrast to the
"divergence" in N/S, no anomaly is detected in the p dependence of the
purely electric analog $\rho_{xy}/\rho(=\tan\theta_{\rm H})$, as also
shown in Fig. 14(d) and which may be trivial since ρ cannot change sign.
Simultaneous measurements of S and N are not yet common in Ce compounds,
and in the rare other reported cases (see, for example, Refs. [69] and
[70]), or like in CeCu₂Si₂ at p = 0, B = 5 T, and 550 mK (conditions
corresponding to the transition into the A phase), the sign change of S
coincides with a vanishing N [illustrated in Fig. 14(f)], so that no
"divergence" occurs.

## IV Conclusion

In conclusion, we have performed for the first time a multiprobe study
under high pressure on a CeCu₂Si₂ single crystal with a unprecedented
high superconducting T_(c) and low ρ₀ in order to deepen the
understanding of the expected Ce 4f electron delocalization at 4 GPa. A
careful resistivity analysis unveils the proximity of CeCu₂Si₂ to the
CEP of the VT line, located at p ∼ 4.5 GPa and a slightly negative
temperature. This means that CeCu₂Si₂ lies entirely in the VCO regime
and does not exhibit a FOVT down to lowest temperatures. However, around
p_(V) and below about 30 K the complete ρ(p) data set is governed by
this adjacent CEP, leading to a noteworthy data collapse. In addition to
the CEP, the experimentally determined VCO line has been added as an
important feature to the p-T phase diagram of CeCu₂Si₂ (Fig. 1).

As an extraordinary tool, the new multiprobe setup [Fig. 2(a)] gives
access to a huge parameter space, in which diverse physical quantities
like ρ, Ce^(∞), ρ_(xy), S, and N can be simultaneously compared on a
single sample and under extreme conditions (low temperatures, high
pressures, and magnetic field). It should stimulate the detailed
exploration of a variety of systems in strongly correlated matter. In
CeCu₂Si₂, apart from resistivity, ρ_(xy), S, and N may also be
considerably affected by the underlying CEP since they reveal pronounced
anomalies close to p_(V) (Fig. 3), highlighting an important change in
the ground-state properties of the system. It still needs to be
elucidated whether these features are solely linked to the Ce 4f
electron delocalization or are rather specific to the case where
VF-mediated SC is present, like in CeCu₂Si₂. An extended theoretical
framework and more experimental data under pressure from different
probes will help to better identify these complex signatures and their
relationship to the electron delocalization.

Overall, this study brings the scenario of SC mediated by VF to the
front in HF physics, and further studies may reveal its widespread
relevance, _even in the more common case where p_(c) and p_(V) are not
well separated_.
