###### Abstract

We demonstrate the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in Bi_{3}Ni nanostructures that have been prepared by making use of novel chemical-reaction paths. We have characterized their magnetic and superconducting properties by means of magnetometry and electrical-transport measurements. Other than in bulk geometry, submicrometer-sized particles and quasi-one-dimensional nanoscaled strains of single-phase Bi_{3}Ni undergo ferromagnetic order. Superconductivity in confined Bi_{3}Ni emerges in the ferromagnetically ordered phase and is stable up to remarkably high magnetic fields. Uniquely, ferromagnetic hysteresis at zero resistance is observed in nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni.

Superconductivity and ferromagnetism, two fundamental ground states of condensed matter, are observed to be highly competitive in almost any material. Predominant ferromagnetic exchange interactions destroy superconductivity by creating a reentrant phase transition as observed in ErRh_{4}B_{4}, HoMo_{6}S_{8}, and related materials.[1] Only very few compounds have been identified so far that show a coexistence of these competing ground states. In AuIn_{2}, a small exchange field of ferromagnetically ordered nuclear magnetic moments is not destroying, although clearly affecting, the Cooper-pair condensate at \muK temperatures.[2] In UGe_{2},[3] as well as related compounds such as URhGe (Ref. 4) and UCoGe,[5] the coexistence might be even more surprising as superconductivity emerges at temperatures where ferromagnetism is already established. The itinerant character of 5f electrons in UGe_{2} might play a crucial role for the coexistence.[3] This is in striking contrast to any other material, in particular, to metallic elements. Among the elements, only few representatives such as Rh (Ref. 6) and granular Pt (Ref. 7) reveal a coexistence of Cooper pairs in balance with weak magnetic correlations that do not establish a magnetically ordered ground state. Even materials where superconductivity coexists with a magnetic ground state that solely exhibits a weak ferromagnetic component of its magnetization, e.g., Y_{9}Co_{7},[8] the magnetic high-temperature superconductor RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} (Ref. 9) or ErNi_{2}B_{2}C where weak ferromagnetic ordering arises at twin boundaries of antiferromagnetic domains,[10] are very rare. The study of electronically confined intermetallics, however, may bear the chance to find much more systems that exhibit coexistence phenomena of superconductivity and magnetism. As shown here for the material Bi_{3}Ni, structural confinement creates ferromagnetic order in a material that is nonmagnetic in bulk topology. At lowest temperatures, these size-dependent magnetic correlations eventually compete and surprisingly coexist with superconductivity.

Superconductivity in the intermetallic compound Bi_{3}Ni had been reported many years ago.[11] Although containing the transition metal Ni, it is known to be "nonmagnetic."[12] In fact, the Ni 3_d_-electron band is filled, and bulk Bi_{3}Ni exhibits temperature-independent Pauli paramagnetism. For this reason, an interplay of superconductivity and magnetism could have only been studied by gradually replacing the 3_d_-electron element by magnetic 4_f_-electron lanthanide ions, as has been performed for the isostructural compound Bi_{3}Sr_{1-x}Eu_{x}.[13]

The crystal structure of Bi_{3}Ni is best described as a packing of Bi_{3}Ni rods [Fig. 1(a)] (Refs. 14, 15, 16) where, according to density functional theory calculations, the bonding in the rods is dominated by Bi-Ni and Ni-Ni interactions while Bi-Bi bonds play a minor role.[16] The electron-localization function reveals a separation of delocalized conduction electrons inside the prism rods and largely localized valence electrons between them. Overall, the bonding between the intermetallic rods is clearly weaker than inside them, leading to a preservation of this structural fragment in the halogenides of Bi_{3}Ni,[17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37] are, according to by insulating iodide anions [Fig. 1(b)]. For the synthesis of nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni, we have treated Bi_{12}Ni_{4}I_{3} with n-butyllithium at room temperature in order to remove the iodine. This reductive etching of Bi_{12}Ni_{4}I_{3} resulted in a pseudomorhopsis of the crystalline material into a three-dimensional (3D) assembly of nanofibers of Bi_{3}Ni [Fig. 1(c)]. We may assume that the spatial arrangement of the one-dimensional (1D) Bi_{3}Ni rods present in the iodide Bi_{12}Ni_{4}I_{3} is preserved owing to the mild conditions, because the reformation of the rod packing of the bulk phase is kinetically hindered. The x-ray powder diffraction pattern of nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni only shows broad humps that correspond to typical interatomic distances in Bi_{3}Ni [Fig. 1(d)].[16] In other words, similar to a nematic liquid crystal, macroscopic superrystals of incoherently but parallel packed nanofibers with individual diameters below 5 nm were obtained. Only upon annealing the nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni at \sim700 K, the 3D order of the crystalline bulk material is regained. The recrystallization was used for the preparation of bulk Bi_{3}Ni (bulk powder with grain diameters \gtrsim 20 \mum) as a reference material. The precursor compound Bi_{12}Ni_{4}I_{3} shows a temperature-independent diamagnetic susceptibility of -30 \muemun/g. Thus, hypothetical traces of Bi_{12}Ni_{4}I_{3} would not bias the magnetic moments of the Bi_{3}Ni samples. However, Bi_{12}Ni_{4}I_{3} is not detectible in the x-ray diffraction pattern of the nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni sample [Fig. 1(d)] and no iodine has been found in the chemical analysis by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. In order to allow for the investigation of the  properties of Bi_{3}Ni at a length scale intermediate between bulk powder and the nanostructured material, a microwave-assisted low-temperature synthesis starting from metal acetates was developed. Under a variation of external parameters, phase-pure crystalline Bi_{3}Ni particles with a uniform size and shape (l\approx 600 nm, d\approx 200 nm) were obtained [Fig. 1(e)]. This material is subsequently denoted as submicrometer Bi_{3}Ni.

For the characterization of the superconducting and magnetic sample properties, magnetization has been measured by means of superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and vibrating-sample magnetometry at temperatures between 1.8 and 300 K. Measurements of the electrical transport properties were performed by means of an ac four-terminal contact technique. A commercial cryostat equipped with a superconducting 14-T magnet and a ^{3}He refrigerator were used for measurements in the temperature range between 0.35 and 300 K.

Bi_{3}Ni in bulk, submicrometer, as well as nanostructured topology exhibits type-II superconductivity. In bulk Bi_{3}Ni powder prepared for this work, a superconducting transition temperature, T_{c}=4.06 K [see Fig. 2(a)], has been observed in accordance with literature.[11] We have identified a Meissner phase up to a field of \mu_{0}H_{c1}\approx 15 mT, followed by a Shubnikov phase that extends up to approximately \mu_{0}H_{c2}=0.4 T (not shown). As compared to bulk material, type-II superconductivity escorted by widened transitions with an elevated onset temperature (see also Fig. 4) but reduced 50% of its normal-state resistance temperature also exists in size-confined Bi_{3}Ni. In submicrometer as well as in nanostructured topology, the diamagnetic field expulsion in the superconducting state of Bi_{3}Ni appears to be more complex. A low-field study (\mu_{0}H=5 mT), presented in Fig. 2(a), evidences a distinct irreversibility depending on the field and temperature prehistory. The application of a magnetic field after zero-field cooling (ZFC) leads to larger field expulsion than in the case of cooling the materials in magnetic fields [field cooled (FC)]. Most remarkably, the magnetic moment of nanostructured and submicrometer Bi_{3}Ni shows clear indications for the occurrence of magnetic order while bulk Bi_{3}Ni is nonmagnetic. ZFC in the superconducting state, application of a magnetic field, and subsequent warming up to above T_{c} leads to a peak behavior of the magnetization at the magnetic ordering temperature owing to temperature dependence of diamagnetic susceptibility in the superconducting as well as an orientation of magnetic domains in the magnetically ordered regime of confined Bi_{3}Ni [see Fig. 2(a)]. At elevated temperatures, the magnetic moments of both confined Bi_{3}Ni structures follow a Curie-Weiss law with positive Weiss temperatures, \Theta=+10 K [nanostructured, see Fig. 2(b)] and \Theta=+20.5 K [submicrometer, see Fig. 2(c)]. At T\lesssim\Theta, in the case of FC, the magnetic moment increases as m=m_{0}(1-T/T_{\rm Curie})^{1/3}, clearly indicating the formation of a spontaneous magnetization below the Curie temperature where T_{\rm Curie}\sim\Theta [Fig. 2(a)].[22] We note that a recent study[23] of bulk samples containing 96.8% Bi_{3}Ni and other phases reports magnetization data with a small contribution (\sim1% of the diamagnetic moment in the superconducting state) that is partially attributed to a ferromagnetic component. However, we did not observe a ferromagnetic contribution in our bulk Bi_{3}Ni samples.

Apparently, the origin of ferromagnetic spin-spin couplings in Bi_{3}Ni is a direct result of the reduction of the sample size in less than 3D. The size confinement leads to a high surface fraction, which modifies the electronic band structure, e.g., owing to surface-tension effects. As compared to bulk Bi_{3}Ni, the Bloch states of quasiparticles in confined Bi_{3}Ni are modified and electron-electron interactions might be affected by additional scattering mechanisms, as discussed for Pt.[24] A hypothetical partial depletion of the Ni-3d conduction electron band would give rise to the formation of magnetic moments and their correlations in submicrometer and nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni. For nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni, the transformation from a 3D into a 1D structure with essentially reduced interaction between Bi_{3}Ni strands may further affect the band structure.

Positive Weiss temperatures (b), (c) and typical power-law dependences of the magnetic moment indicate ferromagnetic spin-spin interactions in the ordered state of confined Bi_{3}Ni. Superconductivity and magnetic order are attended by a zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) irreversibility in confined Bi_{3}Ni (a).

## Structure-Induced Coexistence of ...

For deeper insight into the superconducting and magnetic properties as well as their mutual interplay, we have investigated the magnetic properties of nanostructured and submicrometer Bi_{3}Ni at higher magnetic fields (Fig.3). In these confined Bi_{3}Ni structures, ferromagnetic hysteresis modified by superconducting diamagnetic screening emerges below T_{c} [Fig. 3(a)]. Most interestingly, ferromagnetic hysteresis and superconductivity appear in the same sample volume. This can clearly be seen for submicrometer Bi_{3}Ni by comparing magnetization data taken at \left|\mu_{0}H\right|\leqslant 60 mT below and above T_{c}. While a ferromagnetic initial magnetization curve is observed for T\gtrsim T_{c} [see magnetization data for T=5 K and 15 K in Fig. 3(c)], a Meissner phase with diamagnetic field screening modified by the London penetration depth emerges at temperatures below without any appearance of magnetic hysteresis effects at \left|\mu_{0}H\right|\leqslant 60 mT [see data for T=1.8 K in Figs. 3(a) and 3(c)]. The entire suppression of magnetic hysteresis in the Meissner phase is an outstanding feature as the field penetration into the grains that have a size comparable to the London penetration depth (\sim200 nm) is evident. In fact, a diamagnetic volume susceptibility of submicrometer Bi_{3}Ni of \sim-0.06 (compared to -1 for bulk material) observed at T=1.8 K and \left|\mu_{0}H\right|\leqslant 60 mT matches well with a calculation that considers field penetration into submicrometer-sized crystallites on a length scale of the London penetration depth, according to Ref. [25]. At fields beyond 60 mT, a ferromagnetic hysteresis loop emerges for submicrometer Bi_{3}Ni that is superimposed and essentially broadened by the superconducting state at T\leqslant T_{c}. To the best of our knowledge, such a definitive appearance of superconductivity and ferromagnetic characteristics has never been observed before in a single-phase material. The mutual interplay with superconductivity enlarges the coercive field almost by a factor of 4 to 300 mT [Fig. 3(c)]. This finding promotes speculations that ferromagnetism and superconductivity correlate and mutually consolidate each other. At high magnetic fields, the magnetizations of submicrometer and nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni clearly differ. In nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni, coercive field, remnant magnetization, and diamagnetic screening are reduced, while magnetic moment and saturation field are clearly increased [Fig. 3(b)]. Whereas the magnetization of submicrometer-sized material saturates at \left|\mu_{0}H\right|\approx 1 T, with a small magnetic moment of 0.1\mu_{B} per Ni atom, there is no indication of saturation in the nanostructured representative up to 14 T where 0.8\mu_{B} per Ni atom is found [Fig. 3(b)]. We started to investigate the magnetic properties of nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni further in pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T where a magnetic moment of \sim1.5\mu_{B} per Ni atom is measured. Even up to these fields, a full orientation of all Ni moments has not yet been realized and further measurements to the more challenging field range above 60 T are required. Quite obviously, the magnetic moment in randomly oriented particles consisting of nanostructured 1D strands of molecular diameter are much harder to polarize, presumably owing to a strong exchange and shape anisotropy. Possibly, also the tighter hysteresis loop and the smaller Curie temperature of nanostructured as compared to submicrometer Bi_{3}Ni [see Fig. 3(a)] originates from that quasi-1D anisotropy.

For a proper determination of the superconducting upper critical field, we have also performed measurements of the electrical resistivity of nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni that has been moderately compacted to a granular sponge consisting of nanoscaled fragments. Data have been taken at 0.4 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K and fields up to 14 T (see insets in Fig. 4). An _H-T_ phase diagram has been constructed by analyzing the R(T,H) curves for characteristic values, R(T,H)/R_{\rm max}(H)=10\% and 90% (see the main frame of Fig. 4). In particular, we focus on such temperatures, T_{\rm max}, where R(T,H) shows first deviations from normal-state behavior and where Cooper pairing emerges in the high-field vortex-liquid state (see, e.g., Ref. [26]) of nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni. Although the onset of superconductivity of nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni is just 5.2 K, its upper critical magnetic field reaches approximately \mu_{0}H_{c2}=11 T (Fig.4). At \mu_{0}H>10 T, we observe an indication for the existence of a low-temperature reentrant phase in a narrow region of field and temperature indicated by a reincrease of the electrical resistance (Fig.4). The critical field is distinctly

The horizontal lines mark the 90% and 10% value (lower inset) of the normal-state resistance. The temperatures where R(T,H) decays below a maximum resistance (at T_{\rm max}) and where a reincrease sets in (at T_{\rm ex}) are also used as indicators for the upper limit of the onset of Cooper pairing (upper inset).

Figure 3: (Color online) Magnetic moment per Ni atom of nanostructured (red) and submicrometer Bi_{3}Ni (blue) as function of \mu_{0}H at T=1.8 K (a). For nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni, the magnetic moment is also displayed at fields up to 14 T (b). For submicrometer material, the evolution of the magnetic hysteresis loop with temperature and its interference with superconductivity at T\leqslant T_{c} is shown (c). A fully reversible Meissner state is present in submicrometer Bi_{3}Ni at \left|\mu_{0}H\right|\leqslant 60 mT (black open squares and double arrow) at T=1.8 K after ZFC (a).

 raised owing to the reduced length scale, d\ll\xi, where d is the diameter of Bi_{3}Ni strands, \xi=(\phi_{0}/2\pi\,\mu_{0}H_{c2})^{1/2} is the superconducting coherence length of bulk Bi_{3}Ni (\xi=29 nm for \mu_{0}H_{c2}=0.4 T), and \phi_{0}=h/2e Wb is the flux quantum. For confined superconductors, the calculation of the critical field is modified to \mu_{0}H_{c2}\approx(\phi_{0}/2\pi\,\xi d). For d\approx 1 nm, this leads to \mu_{0}H_{c2}\approx 11 T for nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni, which matches well with the experimental value. The maximum possible critical field to break up Cooper pairs in the singlet state, however, is given by the Zeeman energy. The corresponding theoretical Chandrasekhar-Clogston or Pauli limit,[27] in simple approximation, \mu_{0}H_{P0}/T_{c}=1.84 T/K, is exceeded in nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni where \mu_{0}H_{P0}=9.6 T (Fig. 4). A reason for that might be the influence of a strong spin-orbit scattering, which reduces paramagnetic pair breaking. In that case, the simple approximation of the Pauli-limiting field has to be replaced by \mu_{0}H_{P}=1.33(h/3\pi^{2}k_{B}T_{c3})^{1/2}\mu_{0}H_{P0}, where \tau_{\rm SO} is the spin-orbit scattering time.[28] Also in several other materials, e.g., heavy-fermion systems and organic superconductors, large Maki parameters, 2^{1/2}H_{c2}/H_{P}, have been observed.[129] In two of them, the organic superconductor \kappa-(BEDT-TTF)_{2}Cu(NCS)_{2} and the heavy-fermion system CeCoIn_{3},[30, 31] strong evidence for the occurrence of the so-called Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductivity[32] and for CeCoIn_{3} a peculiar interplay between superconducting and magnetic ground states have been found recently. In confined nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni, however, Cooper pairs are even stable in an inhospitable internal magnetic exchange field caused by the formation of ferromagnetic order, i.e., precisely the premise that has been taken by Fulde and Ferrell.[32] The coexistence of superconductivity with ferromagnetic order would most likely be possible in the case of spin-triplet pairing. The absence of an inversion center of the lattice of confined Bi_{3}Ni would allow for the formation of an antisymmetric spatial component of the electron-wave function and could lead to a significant admixture of a triplet component of the order parameter. However, as the lattice of bulk Bi_{3}Ni is centrosymmetric, the question remains as to whether the loss of structural long-range order at the surface of confined nanostructures could induce antisymmetry of the charge carrier wave function. The results, demonstrated in Fig. 4, in particular, the occurrence of a high-field low-temperature reentrant phase, are a first hint that the onset of the formation of Cooper pairs is linked to the magnetic ground state of confined Bi_{3}Ni in a rather complex way.

In summary, superconducting and ferromagnetic material properties evidently complement each other in confined Bi_{3}Ni structures. Superconductivity emerges in the ferromagnetic phase and coexists in the highly spin-polarized ferromagnetic state. With the application of additional experimental techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance, deeper insight in the symmetry of the superconducting wave function in k space may be gained. In addition, the preparation and investigation of Bi_{3}Ni and related compounds also in other sizes ranging from bulk to nanostructured confined geometry will be informative.

###### Abstract

We demonstrate the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in Bi_{3}Ni nanostructures that have been prepared by making use of novel chemical-reaction paths. We have characterized their magnetic and superconducting properties by means of magnetometry and electrical-transport measurements. Other than in bulk geometry, submicrometer-sized particles and quasi-one-dimensional nanoscaled strains of single-phase Bi_{3}Ni undergo ferromagnetic order. Superconductivity in confined Bi_{3}Ni emerges in the ferromagnetically ordered phase and is stable up to remarkably high magnetic fields. Uniquely, ferromagnetic hysteresis at zero resistance is observed in nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni.

Superconductivity and ferromagnetism, two fundamental ground states of condensed matter, are observed to be highly competitive in almost any material. Predominant ferromagnetic exchange interactions destroy superconductivity by creating a reentrant phase transition as observed in ErRh_{4}B_{4}, HoMo_{6}S_{8}, and related materials.[1] Only very few compounds have been identified so far that show a coexistence of these competing ground states. In AuIn_{2}, a small exchange field of ferromagnetically ordered nuclear magnetic moments is not destroying, although clearly affecting, the Cooper-pair condensate at \muK temperatures.[2] In UGe_{2},[3] as well as related compounds such as URhGe (Ref. 4) and UCoGe,[5] the coexistence might be even more surprising as superconductivity emerges at temperatures where ferromagnetism is already established. The itinerant character of 5f electrons in UGe_{2} might play a crucial role for the coexistence.[3] This is in striking contrast to any other material, in particular, to metallic elements. Among the elements, only few representatives such as Rh (Ref. 6) and granular Pt (Ref. 7) reveal a coexistence of Cooper pairs in balance with weak magnetic correlations that do not establish a magnetically ordered ground state. Even materials where superconductivity coexists with a magnetic ground state that solely exhibits a weak ferromagnetic component of its magnetization, e.g., Y_{9}Co_{7},[8] the magnetic high-temperature superconductor RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} (Ref. 9) or ErNi_{2}B_{2}C where weak ferromagnetic ordering arises at twin boundaries of antiferromagnetic domains,[10] are very rare. The study of electronically confined intermetallics, however, may bear the chance to find much more systems that exhibit coexistence phenomena of superconductivity and magnetism. As shown here for the material Bi_{3}Ni, structural confinement creates ferromagnetic order in a material that is nonmagnetic in bulk topology. At lowest temperatures, these size-dependent magnetic correlations eventually compete and surprisingly coexist with superconductivity.

Superconductivity in the intermetallic compound Bi_{3}Ni had been reported many years ago.[11] Although containing the transition metal Ni, it is known to be "nonmagnetic."[12] In fact, the Ni 3_d_-electron band is filled, and bulk Bi_{3}Ni exhibits temperature-independent Pauli paramagnetism. For this reason, an interplay of superconductivity and magnetism could have only been studied by gradually replacing the 3_d_-electron element by magnetic 4_f_-electron lanthanide ions, as has been performed for the isostructural compound Bi_{3}Sr_{1-x}Eu_{x}.[13]

The crystal structure of Bi_{3}Ni is best described as a packing of Bi_{3}Ni rods [Fig. 1(a)] (Refs. 14, 15, 16) where, according to density functional theory calculations, the bonding in the rods is dominated by Bi-Ni and Ni-Ni interactions while Bi-Bi bonds play a minor role.[16] The electron-localization function reveals a separation of delocalized conduction electrons inside the prism rods and largely localized valence electrons between them. Overall, the bonding between the intermetallic rods is clearly weaker than inside them, leading to a preservation of this structural fragment in the halogenides of Bi_{3}Ni,[17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37] are, according to by insulating iodide anions [Fig. 1(b)]. For the synthesis of nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni, we have treated Bi_{12}Ni_{4}I_{3} with n-butyllithium at room temperature in order to remove the iodine. This reductive etching of Bi_{12}Ni_{4}I_{3} resulted in a pseudomorhopsis of the crystalline material into a three-dimensional (3D) assembly of nanofibers of Bi_{3}Ni [Fig. 1(c)]. We may assume that the spatial arrangement of the one-dimensional (1D) Bi_{3}Ni rods present in the iodide Bi_{12}Ni_{4}I_{3} is preserved owing to the mild conditions, because the reformation of the rod packing of the bulk phase is kinetically hindered. The x-ray powder diffraction pattern of nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni only shows broad humps that correspond to typical interatomic distances in Bi_{3}Ni [Fig. 1(d)].[16] In other words, similar to a nematic liquid crystal, macroscopic superrystals of incoherently but parallel packed nanofibers with individual diameters below 5 nm were obtained. Only upon annealing the nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni at \sim700 K, the 3D order of the crystalline bulk material is regained. The recrystallization was used for the preparation of bulk Bi_{3}Ni (bulk powder with grain diameters \gtrsim 20 \mum) as a reference material. The precursor compound Bi_{12}Ni_{4}I_{3} shows a temperature-independent diamagnetic susceptibility of -30 \muemun/g. Thus, hypothetical traces of Bi_{12}Ni_{4}I_{3} would not bias the magnetic moments of the Bi_{3}Ni samples. However, Bi_{12}Ni_{4}I_{3} is not detectible in the x-ray diffraction pattern of the nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni sample [Fig. 1(d)] and no iodine has been found in the chemical analysis by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. In order to allow for the investigation of the  properties of Bi_{3}Ni at a length scale intermediate between bulk powder and the nanostructured material, a microwave-assisted low-temperature synthesis starting from metal acetates was developed. Under a variation of external parameters, phase-pure crystalline Bi_{3}Ni particles with a uniform size and shape (l\approx 600 nm, d\approx 200 nm) were obtained [Fig. 1(e)]. This material is subsequently denoted as submicrometer Bi_{3}Ni.

For the characterization of the superconducting and magnetic sample properties, magnetization has been measured by means of superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and vibrating-sample magnetometry at temperatures between 1.8 and 300 K. Measurements of the electrical transport properties were performed by means of an ac four-terminal contact technique. A commercial cryostat equipped with a superconducting 14-T magnet and a ^{3}He refrigerator were used for measurements in the temperature range between 0.35 and 300 K.

Bi_{3}Ni in bulk, submicrometer, as well as nanostructured topology exhibits type-II superconductivity. In bulk Bi_{3}Ni powder prepared for this work, a superconducting transition temperature, T_{c}=4.06 K [see Fig. 2(a)], has been observed in accordance with literature.[11] We have identified a Meissner phase up to a field of \mu_{0}H_{c1}\approx 15 mT, followed by a Shubnikov phase that extends up to approximately \mu_{0}H_{c2}=0.4 T (not shown). As compared to bulk material, type-II superconductivity escorted by widened transitions with an elevated onset temperature (see also Fig. 4) but reduced 50% of its normal-state resistance temperature also exists in size-confined Bi_{3}Ni. In submicrometer as well as in nanostructured topology, the diamagnetic field expulsion in the superconducting state of Bi_{3}Ni appears to be more complex. A low-field study (\mu_{0}H=5 mT), presented in Fig. 2(a), evidences a distinct irreversibility depending on the field and temperature prehistory. The application of a magnetic field after zero-field cooling (ZFC) leads to larger field expulsion than in the case of cooling the materials in magnetic fields [field cooled (FC)]. Most remarkably, the magnetic moment of nanostructured and submicrometer Bi_{3}Ni shows clear indications for the occurrence of magnetic order while bulk Bi_{3}Ni is nonmagnetic. ZFC in the superconducting state, application of a magnetic field, and subsequent warming up to above T_{c} leads to a peak behavior of the magnetization at the magnetic ordering temperature owing to temperature dependence of diamagnetic susceptibility in the superconducting as well as an orientation of magnetic domains in the magnetically ordered regime of confined Bi_{3}Ni [see Fig. 2(a)]. At elevated temperatures, the magnetic moments of both confined Bi_{3}Ni structures follow a Curie-Weiss law with positive Weiss temperatures, \Theta=+10 K [nanostructured, see Fig. 2(b)] and \Theta=+20.5 K [submicrometer, see Fig. 2(c)]. At T\lesssim\Theta, in the case of FC, the magnetic moment increases as m=m_{0}(1-T/T_{\rm Curie})^{1/3}, clearly indicating the formation of a spontaneous magnetization below the Curie temperature where T_{\rm Curie}\sim\Theta [Fig. 2(a)].[22] We note that a recent study[23] of bulk samples containing 96.8% Bi_{3}Ni and other phases reports magnetization data with a small contribution (\sim1% of the diamagnetic moment in the superconducting state) that is partially attributed to a ferromagnetic component. However, we did not observe a ferromagnetic contribution in our bulk Bi_{3}Ni samples.

Apparently, the origin of ferromagnetic spin-spin couplings in Bi_{3}Ni is a direct result of the reduction of the sample size in less than 3D. The size confinement leads to a high surface fraction, which modifies the electronic band structure, e.g., owing to surface-tension effects. As compared to bulk Bi_{3}Ni, the Bloch states of quasiparticles in confined Bi_{3}Ni are modified and electron-electron interactions might be affected by additional scattering mechanisms, as discussed for Pt.[24] A hypothetical partial depletion of the Ni-3d conduction electron band would give rise to the formation of magnetic moments and their correlations in submicrometer and nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni. For nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni, the transformation from a 3D into a 1D structure with essentially reduced interaction between Bi_{3}Ni strands may further affect the band structure.

Positive Weiss temperatures (b), (c) and typical power-law dependences of the magnetic moment indicate ferromagnetic spin-spin interactions in the ordered state of confined Bi_{3}Ni. Superconductivity and magnetic order are attended by a zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) irreversibility in confined Bi_{3}Ni (a).

## Structure-Induced Coexistence of ...

For deeper insight into the superconducting and magnetic properties as well as their mutual interplay, we have investigated the magnetic properties of nanostructured and submicrometer Bi_{3}Ni at higher magnetic fields (Fig.3). In these confined Bi_{3}Ni structures, ferromagnetic hysteresis modified by superconducting diamagnetic screening emerges below T_{c} [Fig. 3(a)]. Most interestingly, ferromagnetic hysteresis and superconductivity appear in the same sample volume. This can clearly be seen for submicrometer Bi_{3}Ni by comparing magnetization data taken at \left|\mu_{0}H\right|\leqslant 60 mT below and above T_{c}. While a ferromagnetic initial magnetization curve is observed for T\gtrsim T_{c} [see magnetization data for T=5 K and 15 K in Fig. 3(c)], a Meissner phase with diamagnetic field screening modified by the London penetration depth emerges at temperatures below without any appearance of magnetic hysteresis effects at \left|\mu_{0}H\right|\leqslant 60 mT [see data for T=1.8 K in Figs. 3(a) and 3(c)]. The entire suppression of magnetic hysteresis in the Meissner phase is an outstanding feature as the field penetration into the grains that have a size comparable to the London penetration depth (\sim200 nm) is evident. In fact, a diamagnetic volume susceptibility of submicrometer Bi_{3}Ni of \sim-0.06 (compared to -1 for bulk material) observed at T=1.8 K and \left|\mu_{0}H\right|\leqslant 60 mT matches well with a calculation that considers field penetration into submicrometer-sized crystallites on a length scale of the London penetration depth, according to Ref. [25]. At fields beyond 60 mT, a ferromagnetic hysteresis loop emerges for submicrometer Bi_{3}Ni that is superimposed and essentially broadened by the superconducting state at T\leqslant T_{c}. To the best of our knowledge, such a definitive appearance of superconductivity and ferromagnetic characteristics has never been observed before in a single-phase material. The mutual interplay with superconductivity enlarges the coercive field almost by a factor of 4 to 300 mT [Fig. 3(c)]. This finding promotes speculations that ferromagnetism and superconductivity correlate and mutually consolidate each other. At high magnetic fields, the magnetizations of submicrometer and nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni clearly differ. In nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni, coercive field, remnant magnetization, and diamagnetic screening are reduced, while magnetic moment and saturation field are clearly increased [Fig. 3(b)]. Whereas the magnetization of submicrometer-sized material saturates at \left|\mu_{0}H\right|\approx 1 T, with a small magnetic moment of 0.1\mu_{B} per Ni atom, there is no indication of saturation in the nanostructured representative up to 14 T where 0.8\mu_{B} per Ni atom is found [Fig. 3(b)]. We started to investigate the magnetic properties of nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni further in pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T where a magnetic moment of \sim1.5\mu_{B} per Ni atom is measured. Even up to these fields, a full orientation of all Ni moments has not yet been realized and further measurements to the more challenging field range above 60 T are required. Quite obviously, the magnetic moment in randomly oriented particles consisting of nanostructured 1D strands of molecular diameter are much harder to polarize, presumably owing to a strong exchange and shape anisotropy. Possibly, also the tighter hysteresis loop and the smaller Curie temperature of nanostructured as compared to submicrometer Bi_{3}Ni [see Fig. 3(a)] originates from that quasi-1D anisotropy.

For a proper determination of the superconducting upper critical field, we have also performed measurements of the electrical resistivity of nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni that has been moderately compacted to a granular sponge consisting of nanoscaled fragments. Data have been taken at 0.4 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K and fields up to 14 T (see insets in Fig. 4). An _H-T_ phase diagram has been constructed by analyzing the R(T,H) curves for characteristic values, R(T,H)/R_{\rm max}(H)=10\% and 90% (see the main frame of Fig. 4). In particular, we focus on such temperatures, T_{\rm max}, where R(T,H) shows first deviations from normal-state behavior and where Cooper pairing emerges in the high-field vortex-liquid state (see, e.g., Ref. [26]) of nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni. Although the onset of superconductivity of nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni is just 5.2 K, its upper critical magnetic field reaches approximately \mu_{0}H_{c2}=11 T (Fig.4). At \mu_{0}H>10 T, we observe an indication for the existence of a low-temperature reentrant phase in a narrow region of field and temperature indicated by a reincrease of the electrical resistance (Fig.4). The critical field is distinctly

The horizontal lines mark the 90% and 10% value (lower inset) of the normal-state resistance. The temperatures where R(T,H) decays below a maximum resistance (at T_{\rm max}) and where a reincrease sets in (at T_{\rm ex}) are also used as indicators for the upper limit of the onset of Cooper pairing (upper inset).

Figure 3: (Color online) Magnetic moment per Ni atom of nanostructured (red) and submicrometer Bi_{3}Ni (blue) as function of \mu_{0}H at T=1.8 K (a). For nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni, the magnetic moment is also displayed at fields up to 14 T (b). For submicrometer material, the evolution of the magnetic hysteresis loop with temperature and its interference with superconductivity at T\leqslant T_{c} is shown (c). A fully reversible Meissner state is present in submicrometer Bi_{3}Ni at \left|\mu_{0}H\right|\leqslant 60 mT (black open squares and double arrow) at T=1.8 K after ZFC (a).

 raised owing to the reduced length scale, d\ll\xi, where d is the diameter of Bi_{3}Ni strands, \xi=(\phi_{0}/2\pi\,\mu_{0}H_{c2})^{1/2} is the superconducting coherence length of bulk Bi_{3}Ni (\xi=29 nm for \mu_{0}H_{c2}=0.4 T), and \phi_{0}=h/2e Wb is the flux quantum. For confined superconductors, the calculation of the critical field is modified to \mu_{0}H_{c2}\approx(\phi_{0}/2\pi\,\xi d). For d\approx 1 nm, this leads to \mu_{0}H_{c2}\approx 11 T for nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni, which matches well with the experimental value. The maximum possible critical field to break up Cooper pairs in the singlet state, however, is given by the Zeeman energy. The corresponding theoretical Chandrasekhar-Clogston or Pauli limit,[27] in simple approximation, \mu_{0}H_{P0}/T_{c}=1.84 T/K, is exceeded in nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni where \mu_{0}H_{P0}=9.6 T (Fig. 4). A reason for that might be the influence of a strong spin-orbit scattering, which reduces paramagnetic pair breaking. In that case, the simple approximation of the Pauli-limiting field has to be replaced by \mu_{0}H_{P}=1.33(h/3\pi^{2}k_{B}T_{c3})^{1/2}\mu_{0}H_{P0}, where \tau_{\rm SO} is the spin-orbit scattering time.[28] Also in several other materials, e.g., heavy-fermion systems and organic superconductors, large Maki parameters, 2^{1/2}H_{c2}/H_{P}, have been observed.[129] In two of them, the organic superconductor \kappa-(BEDT-TTF)_{2}Cu(NCS)_{2} and the heavy-fermion system CeCoIn_{3},[30, 31] strong evidence for the occurrence of the so-called Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductivity[32] and for CeCoIn_{3} a peculiar interplay between superconducting and magnetic ground states have been found recently. In confined nanostructured Bi_{3}Ni, however, Cooper pairs are even stable in an inhospitable internal magnetic exchange field caused by the formation of ferromagnetic order, i.e., precisely the premise that has been taken by Fulde and Ferrell.[32] The coexistence of superconductivity with ferromagnetic order would most likely be possible in the case of spin-triplet pairing. The absence of an inversion center of the lattice of confined Bi_{3}Ni would allow for the formation of an antisymmetric spatial component of the electron-wave function and could lead to a significant admixture of a triplet component of the order parameter. However, as the lattice of bulk Bi_{3}Ni is centrosymmetric, the question remains as to whether the loss of structural long-range order at the surface of confined nanostructures could induce antisymmetry of the charge carrier wave function. The results, demonstrated in Fig. 4, in particular, the occurrence of a high-field low-temperature reentrant phase, are a first hint that the onset of the formation of Cooper pairs is linked to the magnetic ground state of confined Bi_{3}Ni in a rather complex way.

In summary, superconducting and ferromagnetic material properties evidently complement each other in confined Bi_{3}Ni structures. Superconductivity emerges in the ferromagnetic phase and coexists in the highly spin-polarized ferromagnetic state. With the application of additional experimental techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance, deeper insight in the symmetry of the superconducting wave function in k space may be gained. In addition, the preparation and investigation of Bi_{3}Ni and related compounds also in other sizes ranging from bulk to nanostructured confined geometry will be informative.
