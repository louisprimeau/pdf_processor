###### Abstract

The specific heat of PrBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{1-x}\)Ga\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) (_x_ = 0, 0.04, and 0.08; _δ_ -0.1) in magnetic fields up to 8 T was studied. A depression of antiferromagnetic transition temperature \(T_{N}\) for Pr ions with Ga substitution becomes evident through broad specific-heat anomalies peaked at 17, 14, and 10 K for \(x\) = 0, 0.04, and 0.08, respectively. Both the magnitude of the anomaly and the \(T_{N}\) values can be suppressed with magnetic field as often observed in conventional antiferromagnetic transitions. The specific-heat data above or below \(T_{N}\) increase with Ga substitution. In addition, by fitting them to \(C\) = _A_/_T_2+_γ_T_+_BT_3 in the temperature range 0.6 <= \(T\) <= 5 K, the linear term coefficient _γ_ of the specific heat increases with \(x\) and decreases with magnetic field. These results suggest that the unusually large value of _γ_ in PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) may be partially due to the strong magnetic correlation among Pr ions.

The absence of superconductivity and anomalous magnetic properties of PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) have received a great deal of interest since this compound was first synthesized. This compound forms the same orthorhombic structure as high-_T_2 YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\), but it is strongly not superconducting.1 Meanwhile, an antiferromagnetic Pr ordering in PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) was observed below \(T_{N}\) = 17 K by magnetic-susceptibility, specific-heat, and neutron-diffraction measurements.2-4 Extensive experiments on the depression of \(T_{c}\) with increasing \(x\) in Y1-_x_Pr\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) have been reported, and various mechanisms for the magnetic coupling interactions responsible for the high \(T_{N}\) in PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) have been proposed.4-6 In general, PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) exhibits at least the following unusual magnetic properties compared to its isomorphic magnetic rare-earth compounds. (1) The value of _m_eff derived from magnetic susceptibility is considerably lower than the expected value of 3.58_m_B_ for the Pr\({}^{3+}\) free ion.1,2 (2) The magnetic ordering temperature \(T_{N}\) = 17 K is about two orders of magnitude higher than expected if one scales the \(T_{N}\) for GdBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) (\(T_{N}\) = 2.2 K) assuming either purely dipolar interactions or the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange. (3) Unlike _χ_(_T_) for a conventional antiferromagnetic ordering, where the magnetic susceptibility decreases below \(T_{N}\), the magnetic susceptibility of PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) increases below the apparent ordering temperature.2,7 (4) In contrast to GdBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\), the \(T_{N}\) of PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) remains essentially unchanged with Zn substitution but is suppressed substantially with Ga substitution, indicating that the magnetic coupling mechanisms in GdBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) and PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) are different in nature.7 (5) The Pr spins are arranged antiferromagnetically along all three crystallographic directions. However, the spin arrangement along the \(c\) axis changes from antiparallel to parallel by partial doping with Zn and Ga.8,9 (6) In contrast to the suppression of \(T_{N}\) for GdBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) by magnetic field,10 the \(T_{N}\) of PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) is basically field independent up to 5 T.2 (7) The relatively high value [300 mJ/mol K2 (Ref. 3) or 200 mJ/Pr mol K2 (Ref. 11)] of the Sommerfeld constant _γ_ determined from specific-heat measurements is comparable to that of heavy-fermion systems. Among these, it is of particular interest to study the correlation between the high \(T_{N}\) and the large _γ_ in PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\). In this work, we present the magnetic-field dependence of specific-heat data for PrBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{1-x}\)Ga\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) to examine the magnetic-field effects on _γ_ as well as the correlation of _γ_ and \(T_{N}\).

Polycrystalline samples of PrBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{1-x}\)Ga\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) (_x_ = 0, 0.04, and 0.08; _δ_ -0.1) were synthesized by the standard solid-state-reaction method. Details of their preparation and characterization have been described elsewhere.7 The specific heat of individual small samples (~2 mg) was measured in the temperature range 0.6 - 40 K with a 3\({}^{\rm{\small{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{            }}}}}}}}}}}}}}}\) thermal relaxation calorimeter using the heat-pulse technique12 at fields of 0, 4, and 8 T. The samples were attached to a sapphire chip (sample holder in calorimeter), which has two separated silicon films deposited on it to serve as the heater and thermometer, respectively. The Si-film thermometer was calibrated against either a precalibrated germanium thermometer in zero field or a precalibrated capacitance sensor in field measurements. The chip was then connected to a constant-temperature copper block with a weak thermal link, for which thermal conductance _ω_ was measured at each temperature and field by applying a small power \(P\) = _ξ_(_T_sample-_T_block) to the chip. When the power was turned off, the sample temperature relaxed exponentially to the block temperature with a time constant _τ_ = _C_/_ω_. Thus the total heat capacity \(C\) was obtained. The uncertainty of this system estimated from measurements of reference sample Cu (~2.5 mg Cerac product 99.999%) in the temperature range 0.6-5 K is around 1%.

  temperature limit. The \(\gamma\) value increases with Ga doping concentration for the same field. The enhancement of \(\gamma\) with various dopants has been observed in Fe-doped Y\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) (Ref. [3]) and Zn-doped La\({}_{1.85}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) (Ref. [18]), which were thought to be associated with the atomic disorder or localization effects. On the other hand, the \(\gamma\) value decreases with increasing fields for all three samples in this work. The \(H\) dependence of the \(\gamma\) value suggests that it may be associated with low-energy magnetic excitations in the ordered state. It has been reported that[19] in heavy-fermion systems the \(\gamma\) values show little (\(<\)20%) or no change in a magnetic field up to 13 T. However, "false" heavy-fermion systems (i.e., those with a large low-temperature \(C/T\) value due to strong magnetic correlation) show a large change in specific heat with applied magnetic fields. Based on the above observations and arguments, the decrease of \(\gamma\) with magnetic field shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1 suggests that the large \(\gamma\) value in PrBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{1-x}\)Ga\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) may be partially due to a strong magnetic correlation between Pr ions.

It is interesting to study the correlation between the anomalously high \(T_{N}\) and the large \(\gamma\) value in Pr-based cuprates. These parameters for six selected Pr-based compounds including Pr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\), PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)NbO\({}_{8}\), PrSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\),Mo\({}_{0.3}\)O\({}_{7}\), and PrBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{1-x}\)Ga\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) (\(x\)=0, 0.04, and 0.08) are listed in Table 2 for comparison. Where the Pr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) forms a \(T^{\prime}\)-type structure consisting of only the square-planar CuO\({}_{4}\) arrangement with no apical oxygen atoms, the PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)NbO\({}_{8}\) and PrSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\),Mo\({}_{0.3}\)O\({}_{7}\) have a similar structure to PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) but with NbO\({}_{2}\) planes replacing the CuO chains and Sr-O replacing the Ba-O, respectively. Indeed, Pr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) seems to have very different structural and physical properties from the other five compounds. Thus Pr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) has no indication of a magnetic ordering transition and an effective magnetic moment \(\mu_{\rm eff}\)\(\sim\)3.51\(\mu_{B}\) close to the 3.58\(\mu_{B}\) for the free Pr\({}^{3+}\) ion, as well as a metal-like \(\gamma\) value suggesting a nonmagnetic ground state.[20] In contrast, the anomalous properties of the other five compounds may be attributed to their unique magnetic and/or electronic structure characteristic of Pr ions. Furthermore, it is difficult to correlate the large \(\gamma\) value with the high \(T_{N}\) from the information listed in Table 2. A high \(T_{N}\) (\(\sim\)12 K) with a small \(\gamma\) in PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)NbO\({}_{8}\) (Ref. [21]) and a low \(T_{N}\) (\(<\)0.6 K) with a large \(\gamma\) in PrSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.2}\),Mo\({}_{0.3}\)O\({}_{7}\) (Ref. [16]) imply that the large \(\gamma\) value is not necessarily a result of the strong magnetic coupling (high \(T_{N}\)) between Pr ions. Moreover, a similar relation is also seen in an increase of \(\gamma\) with a decrease of the high \(T_{N}\) in PrBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{1-x}\)Ga\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\). Therefore the primary origin of large \(\gamma\) values in Pr-based cuprates is still unclear.

In summary, magnetic-field effects on the specific heat of

  PrBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{1-x}\)Ga\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) are presented and discussed. Several features can be concluded from the present data. (1) A depression of \(T_{N}\) with \(x\) is clearly shown by the specific-heat anomalies, even though there is only a slope change in the \(\chi\)-\(T\) curve. (2) The specific-heat anomalies are broader than those in typical magnetic transitions. However, both their magnitudes and the \(T_{N}\) values for PrBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{1-x}\)Ga\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) are suppressed by magnetic field, suggesting that the magnetic transition of this system is consistent with conventional antiferromagnetic ordering. (3) The low-temperature specific-heat data are slightly suppressed with magnetic field and the derived \(\gamma\) values show an significant decrease in the magnetic field up to 8 T. Therefore the large \(\gamma\) value in PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) may be partially induced by the strong magnetic correlation. (4) The increase of \(\gamma\) values with decrease of \(T_{N}\) in PrBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{1-x}\)Ga\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) suggests that the origin of large \(\gamma\) values in these particular Pr-based cuprates needs further clarification.
