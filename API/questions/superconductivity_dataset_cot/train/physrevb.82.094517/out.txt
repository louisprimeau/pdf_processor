###### Abstract

In this paper, the superconducting properties of YSn_{3} are reported. YSn_{3} has a cubic AuCu_{3}-type structure with the space group Pm\overline{3}m. Magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and specific-heat data showed that YSn_{3} is a superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature (T_{\rm c}) of 7 K. The magnetization versus magnetic field (M-H) curve shows the typical type-II superconducting behavior. The estimated lower critical field H_{\rm c1}(0) and the upper critical field H_{\rm c2}(0) are about 90 Oe and 3000 Oe, respectively. The penetration depth \lambda(0) and coherence length \xi(0) are calculated to be approximately 270 nm and 66 nm, respectively, using the Ginzburg-Landau equations. The estimated Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma_{\rm S} is 7.57 mJ/mol K^{2}. The normalized specific heat jump \Delta C/\gamma_{\rm N}T_{\rm c} is estimated to be about 2.19, which is higher than the value predicted by the BCS theory in the weak-coupling limit, i.e., \Delta C/\gamma_{\rm N}T_{\rm c}=1.43. This fact indicates that superconductivity in YSn_{3} exists in the strong-coupling regime. The difference between T_{\rm c} of LnX_{3} (X=family of 13 or 14 elements) compounds is discussed to compare their physical properties.

## I Introduction

High-pressure synthesis techniques have been successfully employed in the search for new materials including superconductor in intermetallic compounds and oxides [1, 2, 3] and enhanced T_{\rm c} value for superconductor. [4] The difference in the size of the atoms in a unit cell may be the primary cause of instability of the crystal structure of some intermetallic compounds. The application of a high pressure can change the relative atomic size. Using closed system for high-pressure synthesis is effective not only for stabilizing a composition but also for expanding a solid-solution range.

LnSn_{3} (Ln= Y and rare-earth elements) compounds are crystallized in a cubic AuCu_{3}-type structure (space group: Pm\overline{3}m). There are some reports on LnSn_{3} (Ln=light rare-earth element series=La-Gd). [5, 6, 7] For example, LaSn_{3} has been reported to exhibit superconductivity at around 6.25 K. [8] PrSn_{3} and NdSn_{3} have been found to order antiferromagnetically at T_{\rm N}=8.6 K and 4.5 K, respectively. [9] Moreover, PrSn_{3} has been reported to be a heavy-Fermion compound. [10] CeSn_{3} is categorized as a dense Kondo compound with valence fluctuation. [11] In contrast, there are very few reports on the heavy rare earth series (Ln=Tb-Lu) and Y. An experiment has been conducted by Miller and Hall [12] to synthesize heavy rare-earth element trisantanide compounds using a high-pressure technique, where in LnSn_{3} (Ln=Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Y) compounds were successfully obtained. YbSn_{3} single crystals have been synthesized by the Bridgman technique. [13] YbSn_{3} shows a superconducting transition at around 3.6 K. [14] TbSn_{3} and YSn_{3} have been synthesized at P=1-7 GPa and T=400 ^{\circ}C-1300 ^{\circ}C. These two compounds also have a cubic AuCu_{3}-type structure with a lattice constant a =0.466 nm and 0.467 nm, and a density of 8.45 g/cm^{3} and 7.27 g/cm^{3}, respectively. [15]

We focused on Ln=nonmagnetic atoms compound YSn_{3}. To the best of our knowledge, the physical properties of YSn_{3} have not been elucidated thus far. We synthesized a polycrystalline samples of YSn_{3} using a high-pressure technique and discovered that YSn_{3} is a superconductor with T_{\rm c} of 7 K. We performed electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific-heat measurements to determine the superconducting parameters of YSn_{3}

In this paper, we report the superconducting properties and superconducting parameters of yttrium trisantnide YSn_{3} prepared under a high pressure. Further, we discuss the difference between T_{\rm c} of LnX_{3} (X=family of 13 or 14 elements) compounds.

## II Experimental details

A mixture of yttrium (99.9%) and tin (99.999%) powders was encapsulated in a hexagonal boron nitride crucible (\phi3.8 mm\times8 mm). The amount of tin powder was slightly larger than that of the stoichiometric ratio of Y:Sn=1:3. Next, the encapsulated sample was subjected to high-temperature/pressure conditions using the cubic-anvil-type high-pressure equipment. In a previous study, YSn_{3} has been synthesized by a melt-process method at around the particle temperature between Y and Sn (\sim500 ^{\circ} C). [16] The sample synthesis was performed under varying conditions of pressure (up to 5.5 GPa, the maximum pressure of the experimental apparatus) and temperature (up to 1200 ^{\circ}C) in order to determine the optimum condition for the sample synthesis of YSn_{3}. The optimum condition for the sample synthesis of YSn_{3} was 700 ^{\circ}C-2-10 min \rightarrow470 ^{\circ}C-10-30 min at P =5.5 GPa. After subjecting the sample to these conditions, it was quenched to room temperature before releasing the applied pressure.

The synthesized sample was analyzed by powder x-ray diffraction using a conventional x-ray spectrometer with a graphite monochromator (RINT-1000, RIGAKU). The color of the powdered sample was dark gray. Intensity data were collected with Cu K\alpha radiation over a 2 \theta range of 10^{\circ}-80^{\circ} with a step width of 0.02^{\circ}. Electrical resistivity measurements were performed using the conventional dc four probe method (physical property measurement system (PPMS), Quantum Design) at temperature from 2 to 300 K in an applied magnetic field of up to 10 kOe. The sample dimensions for resistivity measurements were 2 mm\times1.9 mm \times 1.6 mm. Electrical leads were fabricated by spot welding gold wires (_ph_25 \mum) onto a polished surface of the sample. Magnetic measurements were performed by using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (magnetic property measurement system (MPMS)-R2, Quantum Design) at temperatures between 2 and 15 K in an applied magnetic field of up to 3 kOe. The measurements were carried out upon warming after zero-field cooling (ZFC process) and cooling in the field (FC process). Specific-heat measurement was performed using the PPMS system (Quantum Design) in a temperature range between 0.4 and 15 K. The sample dimensions for specific-heat measurement were about 1.5 mm\times1.5 mm\times2 mm.

YSn_{3} decomposes into metallic tin within 2 weeks.[12] The synthesized sample also decomposed in air. After synthesis, the sample was placed in Ar atmosphere to prevent its decomposition. The sample quality was checked one week after the synthesis. The results of powder x-ray diffraction showed that the bulk sample did not decompose and this sample exhibited a sharp superconducting transition. Consequently, the physical properties of the sample were measured within 5 days of the sample synthesis.

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1 shows the powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of synthesized YSn_{3} obtained at room temperature. The main phase is indexed as a cubic unit cell with the space group of Pm\overline{3}m. There are extra reflections, which belong to the impurity phase, identified as Sn. This result is consistent with that obtained in previous works.[12, 17] From the intensity data from the PXRD measurement, refinement is performing to account for an admixture of Sn phase, whose weight fraction was refined to be \approx39%. The crystal structure of YSn_{3} is shown in the inset of Fig. 1. The lattice parameter, a, calculated from indexes is 0.4667(4) nm. It is consistent with the data presented in a previous report.[15]

The temperature dependence of dc magnetic susceptibility under a magnetic field of 10 Oe is shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2 shows a large diamagnetic response at around 7 K, suggesting the occurrence of superconductivity, both in ZFC and FC processes. In the yttrium-tin system, intermetallic compounds having the following formulas have been identified: Y_{5}Sn_{3} (hexagonal Mn_{3}Si_{3}-type structure), Y_{5}Sn_{4} (orthorhombic Sm_{3}Ge_{4}-type structure), Y_{11}Sn_{10} (tetragonal Ho_{11}Ge_{10}-type structure), YSn_{2} (orthorhombic ZrSi_{2}-type structure), and YSn_{3} (cubic AuCu_{3}-type structure).[16, 19] The powder x-ray diffraction pattern of our sample shows that the sample includes YSn_{3} as the main phase and Sn as the impurity phase. There are no additional peaks in the x-ray diffraction data. It is concluded that the large Meissner response at around 7 K originated from YSn_{3} superconductor. A weak anomaly is confirmed in the ZFC data of magnetic susceptibility at around 3.8 K. This anomaly is caused by the contribution of the superconductivity of the impurity phase of Sn, whose T_{\rm c} is 3.7 K.

The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity is shown in Fig. 3. The electrical resistivity data show a metallic behavior with the residual resistivity ratio (RRR): \rho_{300\text{ K}}/\rho_{0}\sim 13 (\rho_{0} is the residual resistivity at T_{\rm c}^{onset}). The onset superconducting transition temperature (T_{\rm c}^{onset}) is about 7.3 K and zero resistivity is confirmed at around 7 K. The superconducting transition point is consistent with the data of magnetic susceptibility. From the results of magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity measurements, T_{\rm c} is determined to be 7 K.

Figure 4 shows the magnetic field dependence of the magnetization of YSn_{3} measured at various temperatures. The data in the inset of Fig. 4(a) shows a hysteresis, indicating that YSn_{3} is a type-II superconductor. The lower critical field H_{\rm cl}(T) was determined from the magnetic field versus magnetization (M-H) curve measured at various temperatures. As shown in Fig. 4(a), H_{\rm cl}(T) was defined as a magnetic field at which the diamagnetic magnetization deviates from a linear relation with the magnetic field. Figure 4(b) shows H_{\rm cl}(T) as a function of (T/T_{\rm c})^{2}. H_{\rm cl}(T) was fitted by the relation

using the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory, where H_{\rm c1}(0) is H_{\rm c1} at 0 K. H_{\rm c1}(0) was determined to be about 90 Oe. The penetration depth \lambda(0) was calculated to be approximately 270 nm from the relation, \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}\sim\phi_{0}/\pi\lambda^{2}, where \mu_{0} and \phi_{0} are the magnetic permeability of the vacuum and quantum flux, respectively.

Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity under different magnetic fields up to 3000 Oe. T_{\rm c} and H_{\rm c}(0) values for Sn are 3.7 K and about 300 Oe, respectively. There is no influence of the impurity phase, Sn, on these resistivity data. The magnetic fields were applied above T_{\rm c}, and the data were obtained upon cooling. T_{\rm c}^{onset} and zero resistivity temperature (T_{\rm c}^{zero}) shift to lower temperatures as the magnetic field increases. The transition widths remain almost unchanged up to high magnetic fields. T_{\rm c} is determined at a 50% decrease from the normal-state resistivity value, and transition width is taken as the temperature interval between 10% and 90% of the transition.

Figure 6 shows the _H-T_ phase diagram of the superconducting state of YSn_{3}. The electrical resistivities are measured under various magnetic fields for two different samples. The data show a linear temperature dependence at temperatures between 3 K and near T_{\rm c}. The gradient dH_{\rm c2}/dT at around T_{\rm c} is found to be about -600 Oe/K. On the basis of the relation H_{\rm c2}\sim-0.69\times(dH_{\rm c2}/dT)\times T_{\rm c} for a type-II superconductor in the dirty limit [20, 21], the H_{\rm c2}(0) value is found to be about 3000 Oe. From these data, \xi(0) value is calculated to be \sim66 nm using the relation H_{\rm c2}(0) =\Phi_{0}/2\,\pi\xi^{2}, where \Phi_{0} is the flux quantum. The GL parameter \kappa_{\rm GL} is estimated to be 4.1 using the relation \kappa_{\rm GL}=\lambda/\xi.

  Figure 7 shows the temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat C_{\rm el} of YSn_{3} at H = 0 Oe. The inset of Fig. 7 shows the normal-state specific heat obtained by applying a magnetic field H = 20 kOe \gg_H__{\rm c2}. At H = 0 Oe, specific-heat data show the bulk superconducting feature as indicated by the clear jump of C_{\rm P} at around T_{\rm c}. T_{\rm c} of 7 K determined from the midpoint of the specific-heat jump is consistent with the value obtained from the other measurements. At H = 20 kOe, the specific heat jump is completely suppressed, resulting in the disappearance of superconductivity in YSn_{3}. A clear deviation from the Debye T^{3} law is observed in the normal state C_{\rm P}, which can be attributed to the contribution of the low-lying Einstein phonon modes.[22]

In order to take into account the normal state C_{\rm ph} (lattice part), we fitted the data obtained at H = 20 kOe by a polynomial

\[C_{\rm P}/T = (C_{\rm el} + C_{\rm ph})/T = \gamma_{\rm N} + \beta T^{2} + \delta T^{4}\]

with the Sommerfeld coefficient of the normal-state specific heat \gamma_{\rm N} and the coefficient of the phononic contribution \beta and \delta as adjustable parameters. \beta is related to the Debye temperature \theta_{\rm D}(0) via \beta = (12/5)N\pi^{4}R\theta_{\rm D}^{3}, where R = 8.314 J/mol K denotes the gas constant and N = 4 is the number of atoms per formula unit for YSn_{3}. We carefully subtracted the contribution of Sn to the total sample capacity.[23] From this fit, we deduced \gamma_{\rm N}=7.57 mJ/mol K2, \beta = 0.83 mJ/mol K4, and \delta = 0.01 mJ/mol K6. We calculated the corresponding Debye temperature \theta_{\rm D} to be approximately 210 K.

In the superconducting state, the electronic specific heat C_{\rm el} of YSn_{3} can be obtained after subtracting the phononic contribution from the total specific heat: C_{\rm el} = C_{\rm P}^{XSn_{3}}-C_{\rm ph}. C_{\rm ph} data are obtained from the fitting result of Eq. (2). The normalized specific-heat jump \Delta C/\gamma_{\rm N}T_{\rm c} is calculated to be about 2.19 using \gamma_{\rm N}=7.57 mJ/mol K2 and T_{\rm c}=7 K. For the weak-coupling limit of the BCS theory, \Delta C/\gamma_{\rm N}T_{\rm c} is 1.43.[24] The calculated \Delta C/\gamma_{\rm N}T_{\rm c} value is higher than that predicted by the BCS theory in the weak-coupling limit, clearly indicating enhanced electron-phonon coupling strength.

Here, we compare YSn_{3} superconductor with other _LnX_{3}_(_Ln_ = La, Yb, and Y, X = family of 13 elements of In3+ and Tl3+ or family of 14 elements of Sn4+ and Pb4+) superconductors with a AuCu_{3}-type structure to elucidate the superconducting state of _LnX_{3}_.

The compounds YIn_{3}, YTl_{3}, and YPb_{3} have been found to exhibit superconductivity with T_{\rm c} of 0.78 K, 1.5 K, and 4.72 K, respectively. T_{\rm c} of _LnX_{3}_ compounds with X = family of 14 elements of Sn4+ and Pb4+ is higher than that of _LnX_{3}_ compounds with X = family of 13 elements of In3+ and Tl3+.[25, 26] YSn_{3} has the highest T_{\rm c} in the YX_{3} system, similar to other _LnX_{3}_ compounds. A previous study showed that T_{\rm c} depends on the concentration of valence electrons, _n.[27]_T_{\rm c} becomes relatively high near n = 3.75, e.g., in YPb_{3}, LaSn_{3}, and LaPb_{3} (T_{\rm c}=4.1 K), and decreases rapidly with increasing concentration of X = family of 13 element of In3+ or Tl3+ in the _Ln_(In_{1-x}Sn_{x})_{3}, _Ln_(Tl_{1-x}Pb_{x})_{3}, and _Ln_(In_{1-x}Pb_{x})_{3} systems. However, compounds with 0.5 \leq_x_ (3.5 \leq_n_) in the Y(In_{1-x}Sn_{x})_{3} system could not be synthesized because high-pressure synthesis was not used. T_{\rm c} of Y(In_{1-x}Sn_{x})_{3} increases slowly from 0.78 K \sim1.9 K with increasing Sn4+ concentration. The n vs T_{\rm c} diagram for the Y(In_{1-x}Sn_{x})_{3} system is obtained in the present study.

The difference between T_{\rm c} of the compounds of _LnX_{3}_ for _X_=family of 13 elements of In3+ and Tl3+ and for X = family of 14 elements of Sn4+ and Pb4+ is clearly related to the density of state from the X site ion. Although the Sommerfeld constant \gamma_{\rm N} of _Ln_Pb_{3} compounds is larger than that of _Ln_Sn_{3}, T_{\rm c} of _Ln_Pb_{3} compounds is lower than that of _Ln_Sn_{3} compounds in _LnX_{3}_ (_X_ = family of 14 elements) compounds with n = 3.75. Consequently, phononic contribution such as the Debye frequency and electron-phonon coupling strength to the superconducting state are mainly responsible for the difference in T_{\rm c} of _LnX_{3}_ compounds for X = family of 14 elements. Figure 8 shows T_{\rm c} of _LnX_{3}_ for _X_=family of 14 elements of Sn4+ and Pb4+ compounds as a function of each lattice constant a. The lattice constant a of the compounds of _LnX_{3}_ for _X_=family of 14 elements with n = 3.75, YSn_{3}, YPb_{3}, LaSn_{3}, and LaPb_{3} (T_{\rm c}=4.1 K) is 0.467 nm, 0.481 nm, 0.477 nm, and 0.491 nm, respectively. YSn_{3} has the highest T_{\rm c} among the compounds of _LnX_{3}_ for _X_=family of

  14 elements. T_{\rm c} increases with the decreasing lattice constant. The phononic contribution to the superconducting state is enhanced with the decreasing lattice constant and atomic distance for _Ln-Ln_, _Ln-X_, and _X-X_.

## IV Conclusions

In this paper, the superconducting properties of YSn_{3} with a AuCu_{3}-type structure are reported. The data for the superconducting state are obtained from electrical resistivity, dc magnetic susceptibility, and specific-heat measurements. A superconducting transition is confirmed at around 7 K and a specific-heat anomaly is clearly observed at T_{\rm c} indicating the bulk nature of superconductivity. The _M-H_ curve at 4 K for YSn_{3} shows the typical type-II superconducting behavior. The estimated H_{\rm c1}(0) value is about 90 Oe. The penetration depth \lambda is calculated to be approximately 270 nm. The _H-T_ phase diagram is also obtained. The upper critical field H_{\rm c2}(0) is estimated to be \sim3000 Oe using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) prediction. The coherence length is calculated to be about \xi=66 nm. The normalized specific-heat jump \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c} is estimated to be about 2.19, which is higher than 1.43, the value predicted by the BCS theory. The determined superconducting parameters are listed in Table I. The electron-phonon coupling strength for superconductivity in YSn_{3} is in the strong-coupling regime. T_{\rm c} systematically changes with the decreasing lattice constant of the superconductor of _LnX_{3}_ with _X_=family of 14 elements. It is concluded that the difference between T_{\rm c} of _LnX_{3}_ compounds can be attributed to the difference in the phononic contribution to the superconducting state.

###### Abstract

In this paper, the superconducting properties of YSn_{3} are reported. YSn_{3} has a cubic AuCu_{3}-type structure with the space group Pm\overline{3}m. Magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and specific-heat data showed that YSn_{3} is a superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature (T_{\rm c}) of 7 K. The magnetization versus magnetic field (M-H) curve shows the typical type-II superconducting behavior. The estimated lower critical field H_{\rm c1}(0) and the upper critical field H_{\rm c2}(0) are about 90 Oe and 3000 Oe, respectively. The penetration depth \lambda(0) and coherence length \xi(0) are calculated to be approximately 270 nm and 66 nm, respectively, using the Ginzburg-Landau equations. The estimated Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma_{\rm S} is 7.57 mJ/mol K^{2}. The normalized specific heat jump \Delta C/\gamma_{\rm N}T_{\rm c} is estimated to be about 2.19, which is higher than the value predicted by the BCS theory in the weak-coupling limit, i.e., \Delta C/\gamma_{\rm N}T_{\rm c}=1.43. This fact indicates that superconductivity in YSn_{3} exists in the strong-coupling regime. The difference between T_{\rm c} of LnX_{3} (X=family of 13 or 14 elements) compounds is discussed to compare their physical properties.

## I Introduction

High-pressure synthesis techniques have been successfully employed in the search for new materials including superconductor in intermetallic compounds and oxides [1, 2, 3] and enhanced T_{\rm c} value for superconductor. [4] The difference in the size of the atoms in a unit cell may be the primary cause of instability of the crystal structure of some intermetallic compounds. The application of a high pressure can change the relative atomic size. Using closed system for high-pressure synthesis is effective not only for stabilizing a composition but also for expanding a solid-solution range.

LnSn_{3} (Ln= Y and rare-earth elements) compounds are crystallized in a cubic AuCu_{3}-type structure (space group: Pm\overline{3}m). There are some reports on LnSn_{3} (Ln=light rare-earth element series=La-Gd). [5, 6, 7] For example, LaSn_{3} has been reported to exhibit superconductivity at around 6.25 K. [8] PrSn_{3} and NdSn_{3} have been found to order antiferromagnetically at T_{\rm N}=8.6 K and 4.5 K, respectively. [9] Moreover, PrSn_{3} has been reported to be a heavy-Fermion compound. [10] CeSn_{3} is categorized as a dense Kondo compound with valence fluctuation. [11] In contrast, there are very few reports on the heavy rare earth series (Ln=Tb-Lu) and Y. An experiment has been conducted by Miller and Hall [12] to synthesize heavy rare-earth element trisantanide compounds using a high-pressure technique, where in LnSn_{3} (Ln=Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Y) compounds were successfully obtained. YbSn_{3} single crystals have been synthesized by the Bridgman technique. [13] YbSn_{3} shows a superconducting transition at around 3.6 K. [14] TbSn_{3} and YSn_{3} have been synthesized at P=1-7 GPa and T=400 ^{\circ}C-1300 ^{\circ}C. These two compounds also have a cubic AuCu_{3}-type structure with a lattice constant a =0.466 nm and 0.467 nm, and a density of 8.45 g/cm^{3} and 7.27 g/cm^{3}, respectively. [15]

We focused on Ln=nonmagnetic atoms compound YSn_{3}. To the best of our knowledge, the physical properties of YSn_{3} have not been elucidated thus far. We synthesized a polycrystalline samples of YSn_{3} using a high-pressure technique and discovered that YSn_{3} is a superconductor with T_{\rm c} of 7 K. We performed electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific-heat measurements to determine the superconducting parameters of YSn_{3}

In this paper, we report the superconducting properties and superconducting parameters of yttrium trisantnide YSn_{3} prepared under a high pressure. Further, we discuss the difference between T_{\rm c} of LnX_{3} (X=family of 13 or 14 elements) compounds.

## II Experimental details

A mixture of yttrium (99.9%) and tin (99.999%) powders was encapsulated in a hexagonal boron nitride crucible (\phi3.8 mm\times8 mm). The amount of tin powder was slightly larger than that of the stoichiometric ratio of Y:Sn=1:3. Next, the encapsulated sample was subjected to high-temperature/pressure conditions using the cubic-anvil-type high-pressure equipment. In a previous study, YSn_{3} has been synthesized by a melt-process method at around the particle temperature between Y and Sn (\sim500 ^{\circ} C). [16] The sample synthesis was performed under varying conditions of pressure (up to 5.5 GPa, the maximum pressure of the experimental apparatus) and temperature (up to 1200 ^{\circ}C) in order to determine the optimum condition for the sample synthesis of YSn_{3}. The optimum condition for the sample synthesis of YSn_{3} was 700 ^{\circ}C-2-10 min \rightarrow470 ^{\circ}C-10-30 min at P =5.5 GPa. After subjecting the sample to these conditions, it was quenched to room temperature before releasing the applied pressure.

The synthesized sample was analyzed by powder x-ray diffraction using a conventional x-ray spectrometer with a graphite monochromator (RINT-1000, RIGAKU). The color of the powdered sample was dark gray. Intensity data were collected with Cu K\alpha radiation over a 2 \theta range of 10^{\circ}-80^{\circ} with a step width of 0.02^{\circ}. Electrical resistivity measurements were performed using the conventional dc four probe method (physical property measurement system (PPMS), Quantum Design) at temperature from 2 to 300 K in an applied magnetic field of up to 10 kOe. The sample dimensions for resistivity measurements were 2 mm\times1.9 mm \times 1.6 mm. Electrical leads were fabricated by spot welding gold wires (_ph_25 \mum) onto a polished surface of the sample. Magnetic measurements were performed by using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (magnetic property measurement system (MPMS)-R2, Quantum Design) at temperatures between 2 and 15 K in an applied magnetic field of up to 3 kOe. The measurements were carried out upon warming after zero-field cooling (ZFC process) and cooling in the field (FC process). Specific-heat measurement was performed using the PPMS system (Quantum Design) in a temperature range between 0.4 and 15 K. The sample dimensions for specific-heat measurement were about 1.5 mm\times1.5 mm\times2 mm.

YSn_{3} decomposes into metallic tin within 2 weeks.[12] The synthesized sample also decomposed in air. After synthesis, the sample was placed in Ar atmosphere to prevent its decomposition. The sample quality was checked one week after the synthesis. The results of powder x-ray diffraction showed that the bulk sample did not decompose and this sample exhibited a sharp superconducting transition. Consequently, the physical properties of the sample were measured within 5 days of the sample synthesis.

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1 shows the powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of synthesized YSn_{3} obtained at room temperature. The main phase is indexed as a cubic unit cell with the space group of Pm\overline{3}m. There are extra reflections, which belong to the impurity phase, identified as Sn. This result is consistent with that obtained in previous works.[12, 17] From the intensity data from the PXRD measurement, refinement is performing to account for an admixture of Sn phase, whose weight fraction was refined to be \approx39%. The crystal structure of YSn_{3} is shown in the inset of Fig. 1. The lattice parameter, a, calculated from indexes is 0.4667(4) nm. It is consistent with the data presented in a previous report.[15]

The temperature dependence of dc magnetic susceptibility under a magnetic field of 10 Oe is shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2 shows a large diamagnetic response at around 7 K, suggesting the occurrence of superconductivity, both in ZFC and FC processes. In the yttrium-tin system, intermetallic compounds having the following formulas have been identified: Y_{5}Sn_{3} (hexagonal Mn_{3}Si_{3}-type structure), Y_{5}Sn_{4} (orthorhombic Sm_{3}Ge_{4}-type structure), Y_{11}Sn_{10} (tetragonal Ho_{11}Ge_{10}-type structure), YSn_{2} (orthorhombic ZrSi_{2}-type structure), and YSn_{3} (cubic AuCu_{3}-type structure).[16, 19] The powder x-ray diffraction pattern of our sample shows that the sample includes YSn_{3} as the main phase and Sn as the impurity phase. There are no additional peaks in the x-ray diffraction data. It is concluded that the large Meissner response at around 7 K originated from YSn_{3} superconductor. A weak anomaly is confirmed in the ZFC data of magnetic susceptibility at around 3.8 K. This anomaly is caused by the contribution of the superconductivity of the impurity phase of Sn, whose T_{\rm c} is 3.7 K.

The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity is shown in Fig. 3. The electrical resistivity data show a metallic behavior with the residual resistivity ratio (RRR): \rho_{300\text{ K}}/\rho_{0}\sim 13 (\rho_{0} is the residual resistivity at T_{\rm c}^{onset}). The onset superconducting transition temperature (T_{\rm c}^{onset}) is about 7.3 K and zero resistivity is confirmed at around 7 K. The superconducting transition point is consistent with the data of magnetic susceptibility. From the results of magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity measurements, T_{\rm c} is determined to be 7 K.

Figure 4 shows the magnetic field dependence of the magnetization of YSn_{3} measured at various temperatures. The data in the inset of Fig. 4(a) shows a hysteresis, indicating that YSn_{3} is a type-II superconductor. The lower critical field H_{\rm cl}(T) was determined from the magnetic field versus magnetization (M-H) curve measured at various temperatures. As shown in Fig. 4(a), H_{\rm cl}(T) was defined as a magnetic field at which the diamagnetic magnetization deviates from a linear relation with the magnetic field. Figure 4(b) shows H_{\rm cl}(T) as a function of (T/T_{\rm c})^{2}. H_{\rm cl}(T) was fitted by the relation

using the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory, where H_{\rm c1}(0) is H_{\rm c1} at 0 K. H_{\rm c1}(0) was determined to be about 90 Oe. The penetration depth \lambda(0) was calculated to be approximately 270 nm from the relation, \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}\sim\phi_{0}/\pi\lambda^{2}, where \mu_{0} and \phi_{0} are the magnetic permeability of the vacuum and quantum flux, respectively.

Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity under different magnetic fields up to 3000 Oe. T_{\rm c} and H_{\rm c}(0) values for Sn are 3.7 K and about 300 Oe, respectively. There is no influence of the impurity phase, Sn, on these resistivity data. The magnetic fields were applied above T_{\rm c}, and the data were obtained upon cooling. T_{\rm c}^{onset} and zero resistivity temperature (T_{\rm c}^{zero}) shift to lower temperatures as the magnetic field increases. The transition widths remain almost unchanged up to high magnetic fields. T_{\rm c} is determined at a 50% decrease from the normal-state resistivity value, and transition width is taken as the temperature interval between 10% and 90% of the transition.

Figure 6 shows the _H-T_ phase diagram of the superconducting state of YSn_{3}. The electrical resistivities are measured under various magnetic fields for two different samples. The data show a linear temperature dependence at temperatures between 3 K and near T_{\rm c}. The gradient dH_{\rm c2}/dT at around T_{\rm c} is found to be about -600 Oe/K. On the basis of the relation H_{\rm c2}\sim-0.69\times(dH_{\rm c2}/dT)\times T_{\rm c} for a type-II superconductor in the dirty limit [20, 21], the H_{\rm c2}(0) value is found to be about 3000 Oe. From these data, \xi(0) value is calculated to be \sim66 nm using the relation H_{\rm c2}(0) =\Phi_{0}/2\,\pi\xi^{2}, where \Phi_{0} is the flux quantum. The GL parameter \kappa_{\rm GL} is estimated to be 4.1 using the relation \kappa_{\rm GL}=\lambda/\xi.

  Figure 7 shows the temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat C_{\rm el} of YSn_{3} at H = 0 Oe. The inset of Fig. 7 shows the normal-state specific heat obtained by applying a magnetic field H = 20 kOe \gg_H__{\rm c2}. At H = 0 Oe, specific-heat data show the bulk superconducting feature as indicated by the clear jump of C_{\rm P} at around T_{\rm c}. T_{\rm c} of 7 K determined from the midpoint of the specific-heat jump is consistent with the value obtained from the other measurements. At H = 20 kOe, the specific heat jump is completely suppressed, resulting in the disappearance of superconductivity in YSn_{3}. A clear deviation from the Debye T^{3} law is observed in the normal state C_{\rm P}, which can be attributed to the contribution of the low-lying Einstein phonon modes.[22]

In order to take into account the normal state C_{\rm ph} (lattice part), we fitted the data obtained at H = 20 kOe by a polynomial

\[C_{\rm P}/T = (C_{\rm el} + C_{\rm ph})/T = \gamma_{\rm N} + \beta T^{2} + \delta T^{4}\]

with the Sommerfeld coefficient of the normal-state specific heat \gamma_{\rm N} and the coefficient of the phononic contribution \beta and \delta as adjustable parameters. \beta is related to the Debye temperature \theta_{\rm D}(0) via \beta = (12/5)N\pi^{4}R\theta_{\rm D}^{3}, where R = 8.314 J/mol K denotes the gas constant and N = 4 is the number of atoms per formula unit for YSn_{3}. We carefully subtracted the contribution of Sn to the total sample capacity.[23] From this fit, we deduced \gamma_{\rm N}=7.57 mJ/mol K2, \beta = 0.83 mJ/mol K4, and \delta = 0.01 mJ/mol K6. We calculated the corresponding Debye temperature \theta_{\rm D} to be approximately 210 K.

In the superconducting state, the electronic specific heat C_{\rm el} of YSn_{3} can be obtained after subtracting the phononic contribution from the total specific heat: C_{\rm el} = C_{\rm P}^{XSn_{3}}-C_{\rm ph}. C_{\rm ph} data are obtained from the fitting result of Eq. (2). The normalized specific-heat jump \Delta C/\gamma_{\rm N}T_{\rm c} is calculated to be about 2.19 using \gamma_{\rm N}=7.57 mJ/mol K2 and T_{\rm c}=7 K. For the weak-coupling limit of the BCS theory, \Delta C/\gamma_{\rm N}T_{\rm c} is 1.43.[24] The calculated \Delta C/\gamma_{\rm N}T_{\rm c} value is higher than that predicted by the BCS theory in the weak-coupling limit, clearly indicating enhanced electron-phonon coupling strength.

Here, we compare YSn_{3} superconductor with other _LnX_{3}_(_Ln_ = La, Yb, and Y, X = family of 13 elements of In3+ and Tl3+ or family of 14 elements of Sn4+ and Pb4+) superconductors with a AuCu_{3}-type structure to elucidate the superconducting state of _LnX_{3}_.

The compounds YIn_{3}, YTl_{3}, and YPb_{3} have been found to exhibit superconductivity with T_{\rm c} of 0.78 K, 1.5 K, and 4.72 K, respectively. T_{\rm c} of _LnX_{3}_ compounds with X = family of 14 elements of Sn4+ and Pb4+ is higher than that of _LnX_{3}_ compounds with X = family of 13 elements of In3+ and Tl3+.[25, 26] YSn_{3} has the highest T_{\rm c} in the YX_{3} system, similar to other _LnX_{3}_ compounds. A previous study showed that T_{\rm c} depends on the concentration of valence electrons, _n.[27]_T_{\rm c} becomes relatively high near n = 3.75, e.g., in YPb_{3}, LaSn_{3}, and LaPb_{3} (T_{\rm c}=4.1 K), and decreases rapidly with increasing concentration of X = family of 13 element of In3+ or Tl3+ in the _Ln_(In_{1-x}Sn_{x})_{3}, _Ln_(Tl_{1-x}Pb_{x})_{3}, and _Ln_(In_{1-x}Pb_{x})_{3} systems. However, compounds with 0.5 \leq_x_ (3.5 \leq_n_) in the Y(In_{1-x}Sn_{x})_{3} system could not be synthesized because high-pressure synthesis was not used. T_{\rm c} of Y(In_{1-x}Sn_{x})_{3} increases slowly from 0.78 K \sim1.9 K with increasing Sn4+ concentration. The n vs T_{\rm c} diagram for the Y(In_{1-x}Sn_{x})_{3} system is obtained in the present study.

The difference between T_{\rm c} of the compounds of _LnX_{3}_ for _X_=family of 13 elements of In3+ and Tl3+ and for X = family of 14 elements of Sn4+ and Pb4+ is clearly related to the density of state from the X site ion. Although the Sommerfeld constant \gamma_{\rm N} of _Ln_Pb_{3} compounds is larger than that of _Ln_Sn_{3}, T_{\rm c} of _Ln_Pb_{3} compounds is lower than that of _Ln_Sn_{3} compounds in _LnX_{3}_ (_X_ = family of 14 elements) compounds with n = 3.75. Consequently, phononic contribution such as the Debye frequency and electron-phonon coupling strength to the superconducting state are mainly responsible for the difference in T_{\rm c} of _LnX_{3}_ compounds for X = family of 14 elements. Figure 8 shows T_{\rm c} of _LnX_{3}_ for _X_=family of 14 elements of Sn4+ and Pb4+ compounds as a function of each lattice constant a. The lattice constant a of the compounds of _LnX_{3}_ for _X_=family of 14 elements with n = 3.75, YSn_{3}, YPb_{3}, LaSn_{3}, and LaPb_{3} (T_{\rm c}=4.1 K) is 0.467 nm, 0.481 nm, 0.477 nm, and 0.491 nm, respectively. YSn_{3} has the highest T_{\rm c} among the compounds of _LnX_{3}_ for _X_=family of

  14 elements. T_{\rm c} increases with the decreasing lattice constant. The phononic contribution to the superconducting state is enhanced with the decreasing lattice constant and atomic distance for _Ln-Ln_, _Ln-X_, and _X-X_.

## IV Conclusions

In this paper, the superconducting properties of YSn_{3} with a AuCu_{3}-type structure are reported. The data for the superconducting state are obtained from electrical resistivity, dc magnetic susceptibility, and specific-heat measurements. A superconducting transition is confirmed at around 7 K and a specific-heat anomaly is clearly observed at T_{\rm c} indicating the bulk nature of superconductivity. The _M-H_ curve at 4 K for YSn_{3} shows the typical type-II superconducting behavior. The estimated H_{\rm c1}(0) value is about 90 Oe. The penetration depth \lambda is calculated to be approximately 270 nm. The _H-T_ phase diagram is also obtained. The upper critical field H_{\rm c2}(0) is estimated to be \sim3000 Oe using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) prediction. The coherence length is calculated to be about \xi=66 nm. The normalized specific-heat jump \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c} is estimated to be about 2.19, which is higher than 1.43, the value predicted by the BCS theory. The determined superconducting parameters are listed in Table I. The electron-phonon coupling strength for superconductivity in YSn_{3} is in the strong-coupling regime. T_{\rm c} systematically changes with the decreasing lattice constant of the superconductor of _LnX_{3}_ with _X_=family of 14 elements. It is concluded that the difference between T_{\rm c} of _LnX_{3}_ compounds can be attributed to the difference in the phononic contribution to the superconducting state.
