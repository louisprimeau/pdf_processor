###### Abstract

We prepared two superconducting phases, which are called "low-T_{\rm c} phase" and "high-T_{\rm c} phase" of (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe showing T_{\rm c}'s of 35 and 44 K, respectively, at ambient pressure, and studied the superconducting behavior and structure of each phase under pressure. The T_{\rm c} of the 35 K at ambient pressure rapidly decreases with increasing pressure up to 10 GPa, and it remains unchanged up to 22 GPa. Finally, superconductivity was not observed down to 1.4 K at 29 GPa, i.e., T_{\rm c}<1.4 K. The T_{\rm c} of the 44 K phase also shows a monotonic decrease up to 15 GPa and it weakly decreases up to 25 GPa. These behaviors suggest no pressure-driven high-T_{\rm c} phase (called "SC-II") between 0 and 25 GPa for the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases of (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe, differing from the behavior of (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe, which has a pressure-driven high-T_{\rm c} phase (SC-II) in addition to the superconducting phase (SC-I) observed at ambient and low pressures. The T_{\rm c}-c phase diagram for both low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases shows that the T_{\rm c} can be linearly scaled with c (or FeSe plane spacing), where c is a lattice constant. The reason why a pressure-driven high-T_{\rm c} phase (SC-II) was found for neither low-T_{\rm c} nor high-T_{\rm c} phases of (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe is fully discussed, suggesting a critical c value as the key to forming the pressure-driven high-T_{\rm c} phase (SC-II). Finally, the precise T_{\rm c}-c phase diagram is depicted using the data obtained thus far from FeSe codoped with a metal and NH_{3} or amine, indicating two distinct T_{\rm c}-c lines below c=17.5 A.

  In addition, pure FeSe [6] and topological materials [7, 8, 9, 10] also provided high-T_{\rm c} superconducting phases under pressure. Thus the pressure dependence of superconductivity for metal-doped two-dimensional materials described above has been an exciting research subject.

The pressure dependence of superconductivity was also investigated for ammoniated Cs-doped FeSe, (NH_{3})_{y}_{\rm C}S_{0.4}FeSe [19], which exhibited a T_{\rm c} value as high as 31 K at 0 GPa [20]. A double-T_{\rm c}-p phase diagram was observed for (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{0.4}FeSe. The T_{\rm c} gradually decreased with increasing pressure up to 13 GPa, and a T_{\rm c} re-emerged suddenly at 15 GPa, i.e., SC-II emerged. The T_{\rm c} in the SC-II phase reached 49 K at 21 GPa. In the case of ammoniated metal-doped FeSe, the pressure dependence of superconductivity was investigated using a polycrystalline powder sample, and the role of the AFM phase has not been discussed. It has been found from these results that the emergence of pressure-driven high-T_{\rm c} phase (SC-II) may be a common feature in ammoniated metal doped FeSe.

Recently, some research groups have prepared various types of ammoniated metal-doped FeSe, (NH_{3})_{y}M_{\rm x}FeSe (M: metal atom), using liquid NH_{3}[20, 21, 22, 23]. Among these, it was found that (NH_{3})_{\rm N}_{\rm A}FeSe provided multiple superconducting phases [22, 23]; the x dependence of T_{\rm c} and c in (NH_{3})_{\rm N}_{\rm A}FeSe is fully reported in Ref. [22], providing only two phases (low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases) at 0 GPa. The smaller (larger) x in (NH_{3})_{\rm N}_{\rm A}FeSe provides lower (higher) T_{\rm c} and smaller (larger) c value. Namely, studying the pressure dependence of T_{\rm c} and c (called as "study on physical pressure effect") using these two phases is significant to systematically clarify the correlation between T_{\rm c} and c. Furthermore, it is very interesting to pursue whether both low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases show the pressure-driven high-T_{\rm c} phase (SC-II). Based on the study of various (NH_{3})_{y}M_{\rm x}FeSe, it was concluded that the T_{\rm c} can be well scaled with the lattice constant c (or FeSe plane spacing) [24], in which case, the T_{\rm c} increases with increasing c up to \sim17 A, and gradually decreases with further increase in c. This leads to the study of the chemical pressure effect of c on T_{\rm c}. This behavior is also established in (NH_{3})_{y}M_{\rm x}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5}[25]. To sum up, the study of the physical pressure effect is indispensable for both phases of (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe.

Here, we report the pressure dependence of superconductivity and crystal structure in two phases (T_{\rm c}=35 K and T_{\rm c}=44 K at 0 GPa) of (NH_{3})_{\rm N}_{\rm A}FeSe, which are called "low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases," respectively. The purpose of this study is (1) to clarify the difference in the pressure dependence of superconductivity between the two phases, and (2) to show the precise T_{\rm c}-c phase diagram for the pressure dependence of T_{\rm c} and the crystal structure. The study of the pressure dependence of superconductivity and crystal structure of both phases in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe must lead to answers for questions on not only the correlation between T_{\rm c} and c but also the emergence of pressure-driven high-T_{\rm c} phase (SC-II), by combining with the experimental data reported thus far [physical pressure effect in (NH_{3})_{y}M_{\rm x}FeSe] [19, 20, 21, 22]. Through such study, we also pursue the mechanism of the emergence of superconductivity in M_{\rm x}FeSe.

## II Methods

The samples of (NH_{3})_{\rm N}_{\rm A}FeSe were prepared according to the method described in the previous paper [20]. The XRD patterns of samples under pressure were measured at 297 K, using synchrotron radiation at BL12B2 of SPring-8; the wavelength \lambda of the x-ray beam was 0.6889 A. A diamond anvil cell (DAC) was used for the high-pressure XRD measurement; the sample was loaded into the hole of an SUS plate. The pressure medium daphne 7373 was used for the XRD measurement under high pressure. The pressure was determined by monitoring ruby fluorescence. The superconductivity of the (NH_{3})_{\rm N}_{\rm A}FeSe samples was checked at 0-1.1 GPa using the dc magnetic susceptibility (M/H) recorded by a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS2); the pressure medium daphne 7373 was also used in the pressure-dependent M/H measurement; M and H refer to magnetization and applied magnetic field, respectively.

The temperature dependence of R was measured in a four-terminal measurement mode under pressure. The (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe samples were introduced into the DAC in an Ar-filled glove box so as to apply the pressure on the sample without any exposure to air. The sample was loaded directly on a Kapton sheet / epoxy resin / thenium in the DAC; six Cu electrodes were attached to the Kapton sheet, and this cell was used for measuring the R of the sample. The applied pressure was determined by monitoring ruby fluorescence. The R of the sample was measured in standard four-terminal measurement mode using an Oxford superconducting magnet system; the temperature was regulated using an Oxford Instruments MercuryiTC, and the H was controlled using Oxford Instruments MercuryiPS. Electric current (I) was supplied by a Keithley 220 programmable current source, and the voltage (V) was measured by an Agilent 34420 digital nanovoltmeter. All the measurements are conducted on polycrystalline powder samples but single crystals.

## III Results

Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show the temperature dependence of dc magnetic susceptibility (M/H) in zero field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) modes for samples of low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe. The nominal x value was 0.4

  and 0.7, respectively, for the samples of low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases. A clear superconducting transition was observed in both phases, with T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset} and T_{\rm c} of 38 and 35 K, respectively, in ZFC mode for the low-T_{\rm c} phase, and 45 and 44 K, respectively, in ZFC mode for the high-T_{\rm c} phase; the T_{\rm c} was determined from the crossing point of flat M/H-T plot (normal state) and the drop of M/H-T plot observed at ZFC mode, while the T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset} refers to the onset temperature providing the deviation from the flat M/H-T plot (normal state) at ZFC mode. These values are consistent with those reported previously [22]. As described later, these samples contain other phases such as pure \beta-FeSe and Fe_{\rm Fe}Se_{\rm g}, but the above T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset} and T_{\rm c} definitely correspond to the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases. The shielding fraction at 2.5 K was 48% and 33%, respectively, for the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases. The shielding fraction was evaluated from the M/H-T plot at ZFC mode. It was evident from these results that both the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe could be prepared.

The M/H versus T plots of the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe samples measured at different pressures (0-1.1 GPa) are shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), where it is clear that the plots gradually shift to the left with increasing pressure; the T_{\rm c} value was definitely determined from each M/H-T plot by the same way as that described above. Figures 2(c) and 2(d) depict the temperature dependence of resistance (R-T plots) for the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe measured at different pressures. The temperature for R drop shifts to the left with increasing pressure, i.e., the T_{\rm c}'s for both phases decrease monotonically; the T_{\rm c} value was definitely determined from the crossing point between the flat R-T plot and the drop of R-T plot. The T_{\rm c}'s determined from M/H-T and R-T plots refer to the superconducting transition temperature for the main phase contained in each sample, which is called low-T_{\rm c} or high-T_{\rm c} phase.

Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the R-T plots for the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe measured under applied H. The applied pressures were 4.9 and 2.7 GPa, respectively, for the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases. Applying H gradually suppressed the R drop, indicating that the R drops observed for both phases can be assigned to a superconducting transition. Here, it is noticed that the complete zero-R could not be recorded in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), because the sample is a polycrystalline powder, which has still resistance at grain boundaries. Nevertheless, the suppression of the R drop by applied H absolutely guarantees the superconducting transition.

The T_{\rm c}-p plots for the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe are shown in Figures 3(c) and 3(d), which were prepared based on the M/H-T and R-T plots at different pressures. The T_{\rm c}-p plots for both phases did not show an emergence of the high-pressure driven superconducting phase (SC-II), i.e., only SC-I was observed at 0-25 GPa, which is different from the T_{\rm c}-p phase diagram previously reported for metal-doped FeSe [19; 1], indicating that the emergence of a pressure-driven high-T_{\rm c} superconducting phase is not a universal phenomenon for metal-doped FeSe. This leads to the question of why such a different T_{\rm c}-p behavior is observed in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe, which is addressed in the discussion section.

Pressures of 4.9 and 2.7 GPa were applied in (a) and (b), respectively. T_{\rm c}–p phase diagrams of (c) low-T_{\rm c} and (d) high-T_{\rm c} phases of (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe. The blue diamonds and red circles refer to the T_{\rm c} values determined from M/H-T and R-T plots, respectively. Open red circles for the low-T_{\rm c} phase represent the cases in which no superconducting transition was observed. The T_{\rm c}–p phase diagrams [(c) and (d)] were based on measurements made on two samples for low-T_{\rm c} phase and three samples for high-T_{\rm c} phase.

The arrows indicate the T_{\rm c} values. How to determine the T_{\rm

 The XRD patterns of the samples of low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases measured under pressure are shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The peaks observed for both phases smoothly shift to higher 2\theta values with increasing pressure. The XRD pattern for the sample of low-T_{\rm c} phase at 0 GPa could be reproduced by the combination of three phases, low-T_{\rm c} phase, \beta-FeSe, and Fe_{7}Se_{8}. The main peaks at 0 GPa were assigned to the low-T_{\rm c} phase (major phase) and \beta-FeSe (minor phase). On the other hand, the XRD pattern for the sample of the high-T_{\rm c} phase could be reproduced by the three phases of high-T_{\rm c} phase (major phase), low-T_{\rm c} phase (minor phase), and Fe_{7}Se_{8}. A small amount of Fe_{7}Se_{8} is contained in both samples. Thus each sample of low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases contains the corresponding phase as a major phase.

With increasing pressure, the peaks observed broaden and overlap. Therefore it was difficult to carry out LeBail or Rietveld refinement in order to determine the lattice constants. Consequently, the lattice constant c was determined from only the 002 peak for both phases, because the 002 peak is not overlapped by other peaks. Actually, we could achieve LeBail fitting for the XRD patterns at ambient and low pressures, and the c values at low pressures determined by LeBail fitting were close to those determined from the 002 peak. Namely, the c values were 13.537 and 13.548(4) A for the low-T_{\rm c} phase determined from the 002 peak and LeBail fitting at 0 GPa, respectively, while those were 17.151 and 17.07(3) A for the high-T_{\rm c} phase determined from the 002 peak and LeBail fitting at 0 GPa, respectively; each sample was set in a DAC for the measurement at 0 GPa. Therefore, at the present stage, the c values obtained from the 002 peak are sufficiently for the discussion of the T_{\rm c}-c plot. The complete LeBail and Rietveld refinements for all XRD patterns at 0-25 GPa may be part of future work. The values of c for the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases at 0 GPa were lower by 0.5-0.7 A than the previously reported 14.257 A for the low-T_{\rm c} phase and 17.565 A for the high-T_{\rm c} phase [22]. This may be due to the fact that the sample is under weak pressure because the sample is set in a DAC even for the measurement of XRD patterns at 0 GPa, differently from the measurement in the previous report [22].

The a values were 3.868 and 3.737 A, respectively, for the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases, values that are consistent with those previously reported (3.889 A for low-T_{\rm c} phase and 3.826 A for high-T_{\rm c} phase [22]). The a value was evaluated from c and the 101 peak for the low-T_{\rm c} phase, and c and the 103 peak for the high-T_{\rm c} phase. The a and c values for both phases show a monotonic decrease against pressure, as seen in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d). The a and c for the low-T_{\rm c} phase were evaluated up to 31 GPa, while those for the high-T_{\rm c} phase were evaluated only up to 17 GPa because of the progressive disappearance of 002 and 103 peaks. The monotonic decrease suggests the absence of structural phase transitions from 0-31 GPa for the

A synchrotron x-ray beam of \lambda=0.6889 Å was used to obtain the XRD pattern. The pressure dependence of lattice constants (a and c) for (c) low-T_{\rm c} and (d) high-T_{\rm c} phases is plotted as a function of pressure.

Details are as follows: (1) from the experimental c-p plots (Fig. 4), the c-p curves in the entire pressure range were obtained by the interpolation with a single exponential function. (2) Complete T_{\rm c}-c plots were drawn by comparing the c-p curves and T_{\rm c}-p plots.

Other solid circles and stars (various colors) refer to the T_{\rm c}-c plots for various ammoniated metal-doped FeSe (see text), and open stars (orange color) refer to the T_{\rm c}-c plot obtained from the pressure effect on T_{\rm c} and c in (NH_{3})_{3},Cs,FeSe (see text). The area filled by thin blue color refers to the SC-II phase of (NH_{3})_{3}Cs_{8} FeSe, while the area without color refers to the SC-I phase of (NH_{3})_{3}Cs_{8} FeSe and the T_{\rm c}-c range of various (NH_{3})_{3},M_{\rm r} FeSe at 0 GPa. Eye guides are depicted by dashed lines (see text).

  low-_T_c phase, and no structural phase transition up to 17 GPa for the high-_T_c phase. These results imply no structural phase transition and no emergence of SC-II in the pressure range achieved in this study, indicating that the physical behavior of SC-I was fully explored in this study.

The _T_c-c plots for the low-_T_c and high-_T_c phases are shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), which demonstrate the linear relationship between _T_c and c. Strictly speaking, the _T_c-_c_ plot for the high-_T_c phase is fitted by a linear relationship, while that for the low-_T_c phase is roughly followed by the linear relationship. In other words, the _T_c can be substantially scaled with c (or FeSe plane spacing), i.e., the _T_c increases with increasing c. This behavior is found in both phases. The _T_c-c plot for (NH3),CsFeSe [19] and the values of _T_c and c for various ammoniated metal-doped FeSe materials [20-22,24] are plotted together with the _T_c-_c_ plots for the low-_T_c and high-_T_c phases in (NH3)3NaFeSe [Fig. 5(c)]. This clearly provides two different _T_c-_c_ lines. As seen from Fig. 5(c), the _T_c-_c_ plot for the high-_T_c phase in (NH3)3NaFeSe lies on the _T_c-_c_ plot for the SC-I phase of (NH3)3)3CsFeSe (physical pressure effect) and those of various ammoniated metal-doped FeSe materials (chemical pressure effect). On the other hand, the _T_c-_c_ plot for the low-_T_c phase in (NH3)3NaFeSe lies on the _T_c-_c_ plot for the SC-II phase of (NH3)3)CsFeSe; the area of SC-II phase is filled by thin blue color in the _T_c-_c_ phase diagram of Fig. 5(c). Thus the _T_c increases up to 46 K in SC-II, while it increases up to 49 K in SC-II. Very recently, Shah _et al._ reported pressure-driven superconductivity in (NH3)3)Li,FeSe, with the highest _T_c being 55 K in SC-II [26]. This may also lie on the _T_c-_c_ plot for SC-II. The increase in _T_c with c is suggested for metal-doped HfNCl [27,28]. The enhancement of _T_c against c will be fully addressed in the discussion section.

Finally, the _T_c-_c_ phase diagram over a wide c range is shown in Fig. 6. In this phase diagram, the _T_c values for metal-doped FeSe's prepared using amine solvents [ethylenediamine (EDA) and hexamethylenediamine (HMDA)], which have a more extended FeSe layer distance than that in ammoniated _M_x FeSe's, are plotted; the _T_c values for (AM)3)_M_x FeSe's (AM:

EDA or HMDA) are taken from Refs. [25,29-31]. This _T_c-_c_ phase diagram provides the complete trend of _T_c against c in metal-doped FeSe. The important points in this phase diagram can be summarized as follows. (1) The _T_c can be scaled with c up to ~17.5 A, and the discontinuous jump between SC-I and SC-II is found at c ~ 14 A. (2) The maximum _T_c appears at c ~ 17.5 A, and it decreases slowly to reach the _T_c (~40 K) for the superconductivity observed in a single layer of FeSe [32]. This behavior is also considered in the discussion section.

## IV IV. Discussion

The reason why the SC-II phase was not found from the pressure dependence of _T_c for the low-_T_c and high-_T_c phases of (NH3)3NaFeSe [Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)] must be discussed. Recently, studies of the pressure dependence of superconductivity in _M_x FeSe [1] and ammoniated _M_x FeSe [19,26] showed the presence of SC-II under high pressure. As described in Introduction, changes of the electronic state (FL to NFL) and magnetic state (AFM to PM) were found for _M_x FeSe [1]. Furthermore, the structural change accompanied by the transition from SC-I to SC-II has also been reported [33], i.e., the transition from tetragonal to collapsed tetragonal structure was found to occur in (NH3)3CsFeSe at 8 K, although such a transition was not observed at room temperature [19]. A study of the pressure-dependent Hall effect in (NH3)3)Li,FeSe showed a clear correlation between _T_c and electron density [26], i.e., a higher _T_c is obtained when a higher electron density is produced by higher pressure. Thus the SC-II phase may form due to a rapid increase in electron density accompanied by a sudden change in the Fermi surface topology (or Lifshitz transition) [26]. Furthermore, a recent study of superconductivity from the K dosing of (Li0.8Fe0.2OH)FeSe showed the emergence of a Lifshitz transition due to the crossing of the \Gamma-centred electron band to Fermi level caused by electron doping [34], which provided a small superconducting gap for (Li0.8Fe0.2OH)FeSe. Considering the structural transition of a tetragonal to a collapsed tetragonal structure observed at a pressure corresponding to the SC-I-SC-II transition in (NH3)3)CsFeSe [33], the Lifshitz transition may be directly related to the structural change or shrinkage of the lattice. Actually, such a modification of the Fermi surface topology (or Lifshitz transition) is unambiguously caused by structural distortion, as evidenced in Fe-based superconductors [35].

Our study of the pressure dependence of XRD patterns showed no structural phase transition at 297 K (Fig. 4), but the pressure-dependent XRD pattern was not measured at low temperature. Therefore we cannot know whether both phases of (NH3)3NaFeSe display any structural change at low temperature, but if such a structural change happens at high pressure, a topological change in the Fermi surface may occur, resulting in a sudden transition from SC-I to SC-II.

As seen from Fig. 5(c), the _T_c values for the low-_T_c and high-_T_c phases are completely separated in the c range of the SC-I and SC-II phase of (NH3)3CsFeSe, i.e., both phases of (NH3)3NaFeSe do not cross the c value of ~14.0 A, which corresponds to the c value providing the transition from SC-I to SC-II in (NH3)3CsFeSe. If the Lifshitz transition is related to the shrinkage of the lattice, and its critical point is the above

Figure 6: Precise _T_c-_c phase diagram of _M_x FeSe obtained from ammoniated _M_x FeSe and amine/metal-doped FeSe. The _T_c-_c plot for amine/metal doped FeSe is added to the _T_c-_c plots shown in Fig. 5(c); details are described in the text. The area filled by thin blue color refers to the SC-II phase of (NH3)3CsFeSe, while the area without color refers to the SC-I phase of (NH3)3CsFeSe and the _T_c-_c range of various (NH3)3)_M_x FeSe and (AM)3_M_x FeSe at 6 GPa. Dashed lines provide eye guides (see text).

  c value, no transition of SC-I to SC-II in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe can be reasonably understood. If this is the case, then to achieve the transition of SC-I to SC-II (or pressure-driven high-T_{\text{c}} phase), more pressure must be applied for the high-T_{\text{c}} phase of (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe to reach the critical c value (14.0-14.2 A).

In Fig. 6, the precise T_{\text{c}}-c phase diagram is drawn for M_{x}FeSe. The T_{\text{c}} could be smoothly scaled with the c (or FeSe plane spacing), and a discontinuous jump is present between SC-I and SC-II. The T_{\text{c}}-c plot for the low-T_{\text{c}} phase overlaps with that of SC-II in (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe. Further expansion of c above 17.5 A provides a negative pressure effect on T_{\text{c}} in M_{x}FeSe. Here, we suggest a unified scenario to explain these results. The increase in 2D caused by extension of c improves the Fermi surface nesting to enhance spin fluctuation, which may reinforce the electron pairing to increase the T_{\text{c}}. This has been suggested for metal-doped HfNCl [27]. Further expansion of the FeSe plane spacing acts against superconductivity in metal-doped FeSe, because of the reduced interaction between FeSe layers (FeSe layer coupling). Such a suppression of T_{\text{c}} with greater FeSe-plane separation is observed in metal-doped HfNCl [27]. Recently, Kuroki _et al._ suggested that the superconductivity is optimized when Fermi surface nesting is degraded to some extent [36], which allows finite energy spin fluctuations around the nesting vector to develop. This may explain the existence of an optimum FeSe plane spacing for superconductivity.

## V V. Conclusion and Outlook

The T_{\text{c}}-c phase diagram for the metal-doped FeSe system was drawn based on the pressure dependence of the low-T_{\text{c}} and high-T_{\text{c}} phases in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe produced in this study, and the previous reports on physical and chemical pressure effects in metal-doped FeSe [20; 21; 22; 24; 25; 29; 30; 31]. The T_{\text{c}}-c plot shows two different linear relationships below c=17.5 A, which belong to the SC-I and SC-II range of (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe [19]. A discontinuous jump of T_{\text{c}} against c was found for (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe, which may originate in a Lifshitz transition due to the change of the topology of the Fermi surface, from the analogy to (NH_{3})_{y}Li_{x}FeSe [26]. If we assume that the Lifshitz transition may occur universally at c\sim 14 A in M_{x}FeSe, no transition of SC-I to SC-II in the high-T_{\text{c}} and low-T_{\text{c}} phases of (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe may be attributed to the scenario that the Lifshitz transition does not appear because the c values of both phases do not pass through c\sim 14 A, as seen from Fig. 5(c), although direct evidence that Lifshitz transition occurs at c=14 A is not still obtained.

In addition, it may be reasonable to comment that the pressure-driven transition may be observed if we can synthesize a (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe sample with a suitable lattice constant c, i.e., a c value that is closer to 14 A. This may provide direct evidence for the significance of c=14 A as a critical value in the transition of SC-I to SC-II. However, it is impossible to synthesize such a (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe sample because (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe phases with only two different c values can be realized, even if x is varied, as evidenced by our previous report [22]. In this study, we did not comment on the role of the AFM phase in the transition of SC-I to SC-II, because the samples used were polycrystalline powders; it is difficult to detect the presence of an AFM phase in case of the polycrystalline powder sample.

The increase in T_{\text{c}} with c implies that improvement of Fermi surface nesting leads to the strengthening of electron pairing, as evidenced in metal-doped HfNCl [27; 28]. The T_{\text{c}} then slowly decreases as c values increase above 17.5 A, and approaches the \sim40 K realized by electrostatic electron doping of FeSe on SrTiO_{3}[32], which is 2D superconductivity. The disappearance of layer coupling has a negative effect on superconductivity, and the limit of T_{\text{c}} achievable by separating the FeSe layers is expected to be \sim40 K. Thus the fact that no transition of SC-I to SC-II was found for the two phases of (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe treated in this study led to the systematic understanding of the T_{\text{c}}-c phase diagram of M_{x}FeSe.

###### Abstract

We prepared two superconducting phases, which are called "low-T_{\rm c} phase" and "high-T_{\rm c} phase" of (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe showing T_{\rm c}'s of 35 and 44 K, respectively, at ambient pressure, and studied the superconducting behavior and structure of each phase under pressure. The T_{\rm c} of the 35 K at ambient pressure rapidly decreases with increasing pressure up to 10 GPa, and it remains unchanged up to 22 GPa. Finally, superconductivity was not observed down to 1.4 K at 29 GPa, i.e., T_{\rm c}<1.4 K. The T_{\rm c} of the 44 K phase also shows a monotonic decrease up to 15 GPa and it weakly decreases up to 25 GPa. These behaviors suggest no pressure-driven high-T_{\rm c} phase (called "SC-II") between 0 and 25 GPa for the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases of (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe, differing from the behavior of (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe, which has a pressure-driven high-T_{\rm c} phase (SC-II) in addition to the superconducting phase (SC-I) observed at ambient and low pressures. The T_{\rm c}-c phase diagram for both low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases shows that the T_{\rm c} can be linearly scaled with c (or FeSe plane spacing), where c is a lattice constant. The reason why a pressure-driven high-T_{\rm c} phase (SC-II) was found for neither low-T_{\rm c} nor high-T_{\rm c} phases of (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe is fully discussed, suggesting a critical c value as the key to forming the pressure-driven high-T_{\rm c} phase (SC-II). Finally, the precise T_{\rm c}-c phase diagram is depicted using the data obtained thus far from FeSe codoped with a metal and NH_{3} or amine, indicating two distinct T_{\rm c}-c lines below c=17.5 A.

  In addition, pure FeSe [6] and topological materials [7, 8, 9, 10] also provided high-T_{\rm c} superconducting phases under pressure. Thus the pressure dependence of superconductivity for metal-doped two-dimensional materials described above has been an exciting research subject.

The pressure dependence of superconductivity was also investigated for ammoniated Cs-doped FeSe, (NH_{3})_{y}_{\rm C}S_{0.4}FeSe [19], which exhibited a T_{\rm c} value as high as 31 K at 0 GPa [20]. A double-T_{\rm c}-p phase diagram was observed for (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{0.4}FeSe. The T_{\rm c} gradually decreased with increasing pressure up to 13 GPa, and a T_{\rm c} re-emerged suddenly at 15 GPa, i.e., SC-II emerged. The T_{\rm c} in the SC-II phase reached 49 K at 21 GPa. In the case of ammoniated metal-doped FeSe, the pressure dependence of superconductivity was investigated using a polycrystalline powder sample, and the role of the AFM phase has not been discussed. It has been found from these results that the emergence of pressure-driven high-T_{\rm c} phase (SC-II) may be a common feature in ammoniated metal doped FeSe.

Recently, some research groups have prepared various types of ammoniated metal-doped FeSe, (NH_{3})_{y}M_{\rm x}FeSe (M: metal atom), using liquid NH_{3}[20, 21, 22, 23]. Among these, it was found that (NH_{3})_{\rm N}_{\rm A}FeSe provided multiple superconducting phases [22, 23]; the x dependence of T_{\rm c} and c in (NH_{3})_{\rm N}_{\rm A}FeSe is fully reported in Ref. [22], providing only two phases (low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases) at 0 GPa. The smaller (larger) x in (NH_{3})_{\rm N}_{\rm A}FeSe provides lower (higher) T_{\rm c} and smaller (larger) c value. Namely, studying the pressure dependence of T_{\rm c} and c (called as "study on physical pressure effect") using these two phases is significant to systematically clarify the correlation between T_{\rm c} and c. Furthermore, it is very interesting to pursue whether both low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases show the pressure-driven high-T_{\rm c} phase (SC-II). Based on the study of various (NH_{3})_{y}M_{\rm x}FeSe, it was concluded that the T_{\rm c} can be well scaled with the lattice constant c (or FeSe plane spacing) [24], in which case, the T_{\rm c} increases with increasing c up to \sim17 A, and gradually decreases with further increase in c. This leads to the study of the chemical pressure effect of c on T_{\rm c}. This behavior is also established in (NH_{3})_{y}M_{\rm x}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5}[25]. To sum up, the study of the physical pressure effect is indispensable for both phases of (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe.

Here, we report the pressure dependence of superconductivity and crystal structure in two phases (T_{\rm c}=35 K and T_{\rm c}=44 K at 0 GPa) of (NH_{3})_{\rm N}_{\rm A}FeSe, which are called "low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases," respectively. The purpose of this study is (1) to clarify the difference in the pressure dependence of superconductivity between the two phases, and (2) to show the precise T_{\rm c}-c phase diagram for the pressure dependence of T_{\rm c} and the crystal structure. The study of the pressure dependence of superconductivity and crystal structure of both phases in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe must lead to answers for questions on not only the correlation between T_{\rm c} and c but also the emergence of pressure-driven high-T_{\rm c} phase (SC-II), by combining with the experimental data reported thus far [physical pressure effect in (NH_{3})_{y}M_{\rm x}FeSe] [19, 20, 21, 22]. Through such study, we also pursue the mechanism of the emergence of superconductivity in M_{\rm x}FeSe.

## II Methods

The samples of (NH_{3})_{\rm N}_{\rm A}FeSe were prepared according to the method described in the previous paper [20]. The XRD patterns of samples under pressure were measured at 297 K, using synchrotron radiation at BL12B2 of SPring-8; the wavelength \lambda of the x-ray beam was 0.6889 A. A diamond anvil cell (DAC) was used for the high-pressure XRD measurement; the sample was loaded into the hole of an SUS plate. The pressure medium daphne 7373 was used for the XRD measurement under high pressure. The pressure was determined by monitoring ruby fluorescence. The superconductivity of the (NH_{3})_{\rm N}_{\rm A}FeSe samples was checked at 0-1.1 GPa using the dc magnetic susceptibility (M/H) recorded by a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS2); the pressure medium daphne 7373 was also used in the pressure-dependent M/H measurement; M and H refer to magnetization and applied magnetic field, respectively.

The temperature dependence of R was measured in a four-terminal measurement mode under pressure. The (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe samples were introduced into the DAC in an Ar-filled glove box so as to apply the pressure on the sample without any exposure to air. The sample was loaded directly on a Kapton sheet / epoxy resin / thenium in the DAC; six Cu electrodes were attached to the Kapton sheet, and this cell was used for measuring the R of the sample. The applied pressure was determined by monitoring ruby fluorescence. The R of the sample was measured in standard four-terminal measurement mode using an Oxford superconducting magnet system; the temperature was regulated using an Oxford Instruments MercuryiTC, and the H was controlled using Oxford Instruments MercuryiPS. Electric current (I) was supplied by a Keithley 220 programmable current source, and the voltage (V) was measured by an Agilent 34420 digital nanovoltmeter. All the measurements are conducted on polycrystalline powder samples but single crystals.

## III Results

Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show the temperature dependence of dc magnetic susceptibility (M/H) in zero field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) modes for samples of low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe. The nominal x value was 0.4

Figure 1: M/H vs T plots for (a) low-T_{\rm c} and (b) high-T_{\rm c} phases of (NH_{3})_{\rm N}_{\rm A}FeSe (ZFC and FC modes) at ambient pressure; nominal x values were 0.4 and 0.7, respectively, for the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases. Applied H was 10 Oe.

  and 0.7, respectively, for the samples of low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases. A clear superconducting transition was observed in both phases, with T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset} and T_{\rm c} of 38 and 35 K, respectively, in ZFC mode for the low-T_{\rm c} phase, and 45 and 44 K, respectively, in ZFC mode for the high-T_{\rm c} phase; the T_{\rm c} was determined from the crossing point of flat M/H-T plot (normal state) and the drop of M/H-T plot observed at ZFC mode, while the T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset} refers to the onset temperature providing the deviation from the flat M/H-T plot (normal state) at ZFC mode. These values are consistent with those reported previously [22]. As described later, these samples contain other phases such as pure \beta-FeSe and Fe_{\rm Fe}Se_{\rm g}, but the above T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset} and T_{\rm c} definitely correspond to the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases. The shielding fraction at 2.5 K was 48% and 33%, respectively, for the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases. The shielding fraction was evaluated from the M/H-T plot at ZFC mode. It was evident from these results that both the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe could be prepared.

The M/H versus T plots of the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe samples measured at different pressures (0-1.1 GPa) are shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), where it is clear that the plots gradually shift to the left with increasing pressure; the T_{\rm c} value was definitely determined from each M/H-T plot by the same way as that described above. Figures 2(c) and 2(d) depict the temperature dependence of resistance (R-T plots) for the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe measured at different pressures. The temperature for R drop shifts to the left with increasing pressure, i.e., the T_{\rm c}'s for both phases decrease monotonically; the T_{\rm c} value was definitely determined from the crossing point between the flat R-T plot and the drop of R-T plot. The T_{\rm c}'s determined from M/H-T and R-T plots refer to the superconducting transition temperature for the main phase contained in each sample, which is called low-T_{\rm c} or high-T_{\rm c} phase.

Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the R-T plots for the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe measured under applied H. The applied pressures were 4.9 and 2.7 GPa, respectively, for the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases. Applying H gradually suppressed the R drop, indicating that the R drops observed for both phases can be assigned to a superconducting transition. Here, it is noticed that the complete zero-R could not be recorded in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), because the sample is a polycrystalline powder, which has still resistance at grain boundaries. Nevertheless, the suppression of the R drop by applied H absolutely guarantees the superconducting transition.

The T_{\rm c}-p plots for the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe are shown in Figures 3(c) and 3(d), which were prepared based on the M/H-T and R-T plots at different pressures. The T_{\rm c}-p plots for both phases did not show an emergence of the high-pressure driven superconducting phase (SC-II), i.e., only SC-I was observed at 0-25 GPa, which is different from the T_{\rm c}-p phase diagram previously reported for metal-doped FeSe [19; 1], indicating that the emergence of a pressure-driven high-T_{\rm c} superconducting phase is not a universal phenomenon for metal-doped FeSe. This leads to the question of why such a different T_{\rm c}-p behavior is observed in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe, which is addressed in the discussion section.

Figure 3: R-T plots at different H’s (0–8.0 T) for (a) low-T_{\rm c} and (b) high-T_{\rm c} phases of (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe; nominal x values were 0.4 for both the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases. Pressures of 4.9 and 2.7 GPa were applied in (a) and (b), respectively. T_{\rm c}–p phase diagrams of (c) low-T_{\rm c} and (d) high-T_{\rm c} phases of (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe. The blue diamonds and red circles refer to the T_{\rm c} values determined from M/H-T and R-T plots, respectively. Open red circles for the low-T_{\rm c} phase represent the cases in which no superconducting transition was observed. The T_{\rm c}–p phase diagrams [(c) and (d)] were based on measurements made on two samples for low-T_{\rm c} phase and three samples for high-T_{\rm c} phase.

 The XRD patterns of the samples of low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases measured under pressure are shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The peaks observed for both phases smoothly shift to higher 2\theta values with increasing pressure. The XRD pattern for the sample of low-T_{\rm c} phase at 0 GPa could be reproduced by the combination of three phases, low-T_{\rm c} phase, \beta-FeSe, and Fe_{7}Se_{8}. The main peaks at 0 GPa were assigned to the low-T_{\rm c} phase (major phase) and \beta-FeSe (minor phase). On the other hand, the XRD pattern for the sample of the high-T_{\rm c} phase could be reproduced by the three phases of high-T_{\rm c} phase (major phase), low-T_{\rm c} phase (minor phase), and Fe_{7}Se_{8}. A small amount of Fe_{7}Se_{8} is contained in both samples. Thus each sample of low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases contains the corresponding phase as a major phase.

With increasing pressure, the peaks observed broaden and overlap. Therefore it was difficult to carry out LeBail or Rietveld refinement in order to determine the lattice constants. Consequently, the lattice constant c was determined from only the 002 peak for both phases, because the 002 peak is not overlapped by other peaks. Actually, we could achieve LeBail fitting for the XRD patterns at ambient and low pressures, and the c values at low pressures determined by LeBail fitting were close to those determined from the 002 peak. Namely, the c values were 13.537 and 13.548(4) A for the low-T_{\rm c} phase determined from the 002 peak and LeBail fitting at 0 GPa, respectively, while those were 17.151 and 17.07(3) A for the high-T_{\rm c} phase determined from the 002 peak and LeBail fitting at 0 GPa, respectively; each sample was set in a DAC for the measurement at 0 GPa. Therefore, at the present stage, the c values obtained from the 002 peak are sufficiently for the discussion of the T_{\rm c}-c plot. The complete LeBail and Rietveld refinements for all XRD patterns at 0-25 GPa may be part of future work. The values of c for the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases at 0 GPa were lower by 0.5-0.7 A than the previously reported 14.257 A for the low-T_{\rm c} phase and 17.565 A for the high-T_{\rm c} phase [22]. This may be due to the fact that the sample is under weak pressure because the sample is set in a DAC even for the measurement of XRD patterns at 0 GPa, differently from the measurement in the previous report [22].

The a values were 3.868 and 3.737 A, respectively, for the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases, values that are consistent with those previously reported (3.889 A for low-T_{\rm c} phase and 3.826 A for high-T_{\rm c} phase [22]). The a value was evaluated from c and the 101 peak for the low-T_{\rm c} phase, and c and the 103 peak for the high-T_{\rm c} phase. The a and c values for both phases show a monotonic decrease against pressure, as seen in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d). The a and c for the low-T_{\rm c} phase were evaluated up to 31 GPa, while those for the high-T_{\rm c} phase were evaluated only up to 17 GPa because of the progressive disappearance of 002 and 103 peaks. The monotonic decrease suggests the absence of structural phase transitions from 0-31 GPa for the

A synchrotron x-ray beam of \lambda=0.6889 Å was used to obtain the XRD pattern.

  low-_T_c phase, and no structural phase transition up to 17 GPa for the high-_T_c phase. These results imply no structural phase transition and no emergence of SC-II in the pressure range achieved in this study, indicating that the physical behavior of SC-I was fully explored in this study.

The _T_c-c plots for the low-_T_c and high-_T_c phases are shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), which demonstrate the linear relationship between _T_c and c. Strictly speaking, the _T_c-_c_ plot for the high-_T_c phase is fitted by a linear relationship, while that for the low-_T_c phase is roughly followed by the linear relationship. In other words, the _T_c can be substantially scaled with c (or FeSe plane spacing), i.e., the _T_c increases with increasing c. This behavior is found in both phases. The _T_c-c plot for (NH3),CsFeSe [19] and the values of _T_c and c for various ammoniated metal-doped FeSe materials [20-22,24] are plotted together with the _T_c-_c_ plots for the low-_T_c and high-_T_c phases in (NH3)3NaFeSe [Fig. 5(c)]. This clearly provides two different _T_c-_c_ lines. As seen from Fig. 5(c), the _T_c-_c_ plot for the high-_T_c phase in (NH3)3NaFeSe lies on the _T_c-_c_ plot for the SC-I phase of (NH3)3)3CsFeSe (physical pressure effect) and those of various ammoniated metal-doped FeSe materials (chemical pressure effect). On the other hand, the _T_c-_c_ plot for the low-_T_c phase in (NH3)3NaFeSe lies on the _T_c-_c_ plot for the SC-II phase of (NH3)3)CsFeSe; the area of SC-II phase is filled by thin blue color in the _T_c-_c_ phase diagram of Fig. 5(c). Thus the _T_c increases up to 46 K in SC-II, while it increases up to 49 K in SC-II. Very recently, Shah _et al._ reported pressure-driven superconductivity in (NH3)3)Li,FeSe, with the highest _T_c being 55 K in SC-II [26]. This may also lie on the _T_c-_c_ plot for SC-II. The increase in _T_c with c is suggested for metal-doped HfNCl [27,28]. The enhancement of _T_c against c will be fully addressed in the discussion section.

Finally, the _T_c-_c_ phase diagram over a wide c range is shown in Fig. 6. In this phase diagram, the _T_c values for metal-doped FeSe's prepared using amine solvents [ethylenediamine (EDA) and hexamethylenediamine (HMDA)], which have a more extended FeSe layer distance than that in ammoniated _M_x FeSe's, are plotted; the _T_c values for (AM)3)_M_x FeSe's (AM:

EDA or HMDA) are taken from Refs. [25,29-31]. This _T_c-_c_ phase diagram provides the complete trend of _T_c against c in metal-doped FeSe. The important points in this phase diagram can be summarized as follows. (1) The _T_c can be scaled with c up to ~17.5 A, and the discontinuous jump between SC-I and SC-II is found at c ~ 14 A. (2) The maximum _T_c appears at c ~ 17.5 A, and it decreases slowly to reach the _T_c (~40 K) for the superconductivity observed in a single layer of FeSe [32]. This behavior is also considered in the discussion section.

## IV IV. Discussion

The reason why the SC-II phase was not found from the pressure dependence of _T_c for the low-_T_c and high-_T_c phases of (NH3)3NaFeSe [Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)] must be discussed. Recently, studies of the pressure dependence of superconductivity in _M_x FeSe [1] and ammoniated _M_x FeSe [19,26] showed the presence of SC-II under high pressure. As described in Introduction, changes of the electronic state (FL to NFL) and magnetic state (AFM to PM) were found for _M_x FeSe [1]. Furthermore, the structural change accompanied by the transition from SC-I to SC-II has also been reported [33], i.e., the transition from tetragonal to collapsed tetragonal structure was found to occur in (NH3)3CsFeSe at 8 K, although such a transition was not observed at room temperature [19]. A study of the pressure-dependent Hall effect in (NH3)3)Li,FeSe showed a clear correlation between _T_c and electron density [26], i.e., a higher _T_c is obtained when a higher electron density is produced by higher pressure. Thus the SC-II phase may form due to a rapid increase in electron density accompanied by a sudden change in the Fermi surface topology (or Lifshitz transition) [26]. Furthermore, a recent study of superconductivity from the K dosing of (Li0.8Fe0.2OH)FeSe showed the emergence of a Lifshitz transition due to the crossing of the \Gamma-centred electron band to Fermi level caused by electron doping [34], which provided a small superconducting gap for (Li0.8Fe0.2OH)FeSe. Considering the structural transition of a tetragonal to a collapsed tetragonal structure observed at a pressure corresponding to the SC-I-SC-II transition in (NH3)3)CsFeSe [33], the Lifshitz transition may be directly related to the structural change or shrinkage of the lattice. Actually, such a modification of the Fermi surface topology (or Lifshitz transition) is unambiguously caused by structural distortion, as evidenced in Fe-based superconductors [35].

Our study of the pressure dependence of XRD patterns showed no structural phase transition at 297 K (Fig. 4), but the pressure-dependent XRD pattern was not measured at low temperature. Therefore we cannot know whether both phases of (NH3)3NaFeSe display any structural change at low temperature, but if such a structural change happens at high pressure, a topological change in the Fermi surface may occur, resulting in a sudden transition from SC-I to SC-II.

As seen from Fig. 5(c), the _T_c values for the low-_T_c and high-_T_c phases are completely separated in the c range of the SC-I and SC-II phase of (NH3)3CsFeSe, i.e., both phases of (NH3)3NaFeSe do not cross the c value of ~14.0 A, which corresponds to the c value providing the transition from SC-I to SC-II in (NH3)3CsFeSe. If the Lifshitz transition is related to the shrinkage of the lattice, and its critical point is the above

Figure 6: Precise _T_c-_c phase diagram of _M_x FeSe obtained from ammoniated _M_x FeSe and amine/metal-doped FeSe. The _T_c-_c plot for amine/metal doped FeSe is added to the _T_c-_c plots shown in Fig. 5(c); details are described in the text. The area filled by thin blue color refers to the SC-II phase of (NH3)3CsFeSe, while the area without color refers to the SC-I phase of (NH3)3CsFeSe and the _T_c-_c range of various (NH3)3)_M_x FeSe and (AM)3_M_x FeSe at 6 GPa. Dashed lines provide eye guides (see text).

  c value, no transition of SC-I to SC-II in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe can be reasonably understood. If this is the case, then to achieve the transition of SC-I to SC-II (or pressure-driven high-T_{\text{c}} phase), more pressure must be applied for the high-T_{\text{c}} phase of (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe to reach the critical c value (14.0-14.2 A).

In Fig. 6, the precise T_{\text{c}}-c phase diagram is drawn for M_{x}FeSe. The T_{\text{c}} could be smoothly scaled with the c (or FeSe plane spacing), and a discontinuous jump is present between SC-I and SC-II. The T_{\text{c}}-c plot for the low-T_{\text{c}} phase overlaps with that of SC-II in (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe. Further expansion of c above 17.5 A provides a negative pressure effect on T_{\text{c}} in M_{x}FeSe. Here, we suggest a unified scenario to explain these results. The increase in 2D caused by extension of c improves the Fermi surface nesting to enhance spin fluctuation, which may reinforce the electron pairing to increase the T_{\text{c}}. This has been suggested for metal-doped HfNCl [27]. Further expansion of the FeSe plane spacing acts against superconductivity in metal-doped FeSe, because of the reduced interaction between FeSe layers (FeSe layer coupling). Such a suppression of T_{\text{c}} with greater FeSe-plane separation is observed in metal-doped HfNCl [27]. Recently, Kuroki _et al._ suggested that the superconductivity is optimized when Fermi surface nesting is degraded to some extent [36], which allows finite energy spin fluctuations around the nesting vector to develop. This may explain the existence of an optimum FeSe plane spacing for superconductivity.

## V V. Conclusion and Outlook

The T_{\text{c}}-c phase diagram for the metal-doped FeSe system was drawn based on the pressure dependence of the low-T_{\text{c}} and high-T_{\text{c}} phases in (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe produced in this study, and the previous reports on physical and chemical pressure effects in metal-doped FeSe [20; 21; 22; 24; 25; 29; 30; 31]. The T_{\text{c}}-c plot shows two different linear relationships below c=17.5 A, which belong to the SC-I and SC-II range of (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe [19]. A discontinuous jump of T_{\text{c}} against c was found for (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe, which may originate in a Lifshitz transition due to the change of the topology of the Fermi surface, from the analogy to (NH_{3})_{y}Li_{x}FeSe [26]. If we assume that the Lifshitz transition may occur universally at c\sim 14 A in M_{x}FeSe, no transition of SC-I to SC-II in the high-T_{\text{c}} and low-T_{\text{c}} phases of (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe may be attributed to the scenario that the Lifshitz transition does not appear because the c values of both phases do not pass through c\sim 14 A, as seen from Fig. 5(c), although direct evidence that Lifshitz transition occurs at c=14 A is not still obtained.

In addition, it may be reasonable to comment that the pressure-driven transition may be observed if we can synthesize a (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe sample with a suitable lattice constant c, i.e., a c value that is closer to 14 A. This may provide direct evidence for the significance of c=14 A as a critical value in the transition of SC-I to SC-II. However, it is impossible to synthesize such a (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe sample because (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe phases with only two different c values can be realized, even if x is varied, as evidenced by our previous report [22]. In this study, we did not comment on the role of the AFM phase in the transition of SC-I to SC-II, because the samples used were polycrystalline powders; it is difficult to detect the presence of an AFM phase in case of the polycrystalline powder sample.

The increase in T_{\text{c}} with c implies that improvement of Fermi surface nesting leads to the strengthening of electron pairing, as evidenced in metal-doped HfNCl [27; 28]. The T_{\text{c}} then slowly decreases as c values increase above 17.5 A, and approaches the \sim40 K realized by electrostatic electron doping of FeSe on SrTiO_{3}[32], which is 2D superconductivity. The disappearance of layer coupling has a negative effect on superconductivity, and the limit of T_{\text{c}} achievable by separating the FeSe layers is expected to be \sim40 K. Thus the fact that no transition of SC-I to SC-II was found for the two phases of (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe treated in this study led to the systematic understanding of the T_{\text{c}}-c phase diagram of M_{x}FeSe.
