###### Abstract

We report an observation of the ^{63,65}Cu nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}. We have measured the temperature dependence of the Cu NQR frequency and spin-lattice relaxation at all four chemically inequivalent Cu sites, and of the Cu magnetic shift at two inequivalent plane Cu sites (for the magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to the e axis). The Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} compound turns out to be a structure containing two inequivalent CuO_{2} planes of differing doping levels, a multilattice in which YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} blocks and YBa_{2}Cu_{5}O_{7} blocks alternate. In the normal conducting state both the static and the dynamic electron spin susceptibilities of the individual planes of a double plane are governed by the _same_ temperature dependence, which shows a behavior typical for an underdoped high-T_{c} compound. The same temperature dependence means strong coupling between these planes, with the lower limit of the coupling constant not much less than 30 meV. Although the planes are strongly coupled, their spin susceptibilities retain a distinct q dependence. The temperature variation of relaxation rate and Knight shift is described in terms of spin-gap formation or, alternatively, of frustrated phase separation. Below T_{c}, the common temperature dependence is lost, which could arise from the opening of two superconducting gaps that differ in the individual planes.

## I Introduction

The understanding of the electron spin correlations and their possible interplay with superconductivity in the complex high-T_{c} copper oxides have attracted considerable interest, since both aspects are of great importance for an adequate description of these materials. Over the last several years the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) have played a vital and significant role in the study of the low-frequency spectrum of the spin fluctuations by probing the wave-vector (q) and frequency (\omega) dependent spin susceptibility, \chi(q,\omega). Relevant information can be gained from the temperature dependence of both the magnetic shift tensor, and the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate at different atomic sites.[1, 2, 3]

Of special interest and importance are, among others, the CuO_{2} double planes, that characterize a whole class of high-T_{c} compounds. Each of these double planes consists of a pair of closely spaced adjacent CuO_{2} planes which are present in almost all high-T_{c} superconductors and where the superconductivity takes place.[4]

From the high-T_{c} compounds having CuO_{2} double planes, the most intensively studied so far is YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} for which now NMR-NQR data are available for all sites in the crystal structure.[1] Many of our NMR and NQR investigations[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] have focused on another double-plane structure, namely the YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} compound[11] that is distinguished by its high thermal stability and precise stoichiometry which leads to well-defined samples with respect to their oxygen content. Their structural homogeneity is reflected by very narrow [63, 65]Cu NQR lines.[5] The lower T_{c} of the YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} compound, 82 K, compared to that of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, 92 K, can be qualitatively accounted for by its lower doping level. The main difference in the crystallographic structure of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} is the double CuO chain in the latter.

Here we report in detail NQR and NMR measurements in the compound Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15},[10, 3, 12] which can be considered as a natural multilattice (Fig. 1), consisting of alternating YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} (1-2-4 for short) and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (1-2-3) blocks containing double and single CuO chains, respectively.[13] The Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} compound has been synthesized under high-O_{2} pressure by Karpinski and Kaldis.[14] However, single-phase samples can also be obtained under normal O_{2} pressure.[15] By changing the oxygen content, T_{c} can be varied between 14 K and 95 K,[16, 17] which is the highest T_{c} reached so far in the Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{6+n}O_{14+n} family. Thus, one of the fundamental questions concerning this compound is why its T_{c} is larger than the T_{c} of the parent compounds.

Our results reveal, among others, the existence of a strong coupling between the adjacent CuO_{2} planes of _one double plane_. Such a coupling was found previously in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6},[18] YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6},[19] and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Ref. 20) by neutron scattering experiments. In addition, we conclude that the alternating blocks are doped at different levels.

 The unit cell of Y2Ba4Cu7O15 contains _four_ chemically inequivalent Cu sites: the Cu(1) chain and the Cu(2) plane sites of the 1-2-3 block and the Cu(3) plane and the Cu(4) chain sites of the 1-2-4 block. As in the YBa2Cu3O7 and YBa2Cu4O8 compounds, the CuO2 planes in Y2Ba4Cu7O15 form double planes separated by Y ions. However, due to the alternation of 1-2-4 and 1-2-3 blocks, the double planes in Y2Ba4Cu7O15 consist of two _inequivalent_ CuO2 planes thus allowing one to study the coupling between such planes.

The lattice constants a and b nearly do not change upon going from YBa2Cu4O8 to Y2Ba4Cu7O18, thus suggesting that the rigid 1-2-4 block determines the basal lattice constants of Y2Ba4Cu7O15. This suggestion is supported by the fact that the a, b, and c constants of Y2Ba4Cu7O15, in contrast to those of YBa2Cu3O7, only slightly depend on the oxygen content. This might also be responsible for the oxygen disorder in the single chains of the 1-2-3 block. Neutron experiments for oxygen deficient samples [21] revealed that a certain number of single chains are lying in the a direction which is perpendicular to the double chains. However, for the high-oxygen content sample, as reported here, there is no misorientation in the single chain [17].

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section contains the necessary theoretical NMR-NQR background. Experimental procedures, including the characterization of the sample, are given in Sec. III. In Sec. IV we present our data, in Sec. V we discuss our results and compare them with neutron diffraction data and theoretical models. The paper concludes with a summary in Sec. VI.

## II NMR-NQR Theory

A nuclear spin interacts with its electronic environment through electric and magnetic hyperfine couplings [22]. In the presence of an applied magnetic field, {\bf B}_{0}, the Hamiltonian of a nuclear spin, {\bf I}, having a quadrupole moment, eQ, can be written as

\[{\cal H}={\cal H}_{\rm Zeeman}+{\cal H}_{\rm quadrupole}+{\cal H}_{\rm hyperfine}\] (1)

with

\[{\cal H}_{\rm Zeeman}= -\gamma_{n}\hbar B_{0}[I_{x}\cos\theta\] \[+I_{y}\sin\theta\sin\phi+I_{x}\sin\theta\cos\theta]\ ,\] (2) \[{\cal H}_{\rm quadrupole}=\frac{eQV_{xs}}{4I(2I-1)}\left(3I_{x}^{2} -I(I+1)+\frac{\eta}{2}(I_{+}^{2}+I_{-}^{2})\right)\ ,\] (3)

and

\[{\cal H}_{\rm hyperfine}=\,\gamma_{n}\hbar\Bigg{(}\sum_{j}{\bf I}\cdot{\bf A}_{ j}\cdot{\bf S}_{j}+{\bf I}\cdot{\bf O}\cdot{\bf L}\Bigg{)}\ .\] (4)

Here, V_{\alpha\alpha} (\alpha =x,y,z) denote the principal components of the electric field gradient (EFG) tensor {\bf V}, with the axes labeled according to the convention |V_{xs}|\leq|V_{yy}|\leq|V_{xs}|. The asymmetry parameter of {\bf V}, \eta, is defined as \eta=(V_{xs}-V_{yy})/V_{xs}, \eta\in[0,1]. For a particular site, x,y,z are chosen as the frame of reference in Eqs. (1)-(4). In all Y-Ba-Cu-O compounds due to symmetry, one permutation of the x,y,z set coincides with the orthorhombic {\bf a}, {\bf b}, and {\bf c} crystal axes. \theta and \phi are the polar and azimuthal angles, respectively, of {\bf B}_{0} in this crystal frame. {\bf S}_{j} is the electron spin operator at the copper site j and {\bf A}_{j} is its spin hyperfine tensor, the sum over j includes only on-site copper and its first neighbors. {\bf L} is the electron orbital angular momentum and {\bf O} is its on-site orbital hyperfine tensor. \gamma_{n} is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio.

In the absence of an applied or an internal static magnetic field, the remaining {\cal H}_{\rm quadrupole} gives rise to doubly degenerate energy levels between which NQR transitions can be induced. For copper, there exist two naturally occurring isotopes ^{63}Cu and ^{65}Cu both having spin \frac{3}{2} and thus two doubly degenerate \pm\frac{1}{2} and \pm\frac{3}{2} energy levels. For each isotope, a transition between these levels yields a single NQR signal at frequency

\[^{63,65}\nu_{Q}=\frac{e^{63,65}Q\ V_{xs}}{2\hbar}\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{3}\eta^{2} }\ .\] (5)

In the presence of a large external magnetic field, {\bf B}_{0}, {\cal H}_{\rm quadrupole} causes, for each isotope and each site, a splitting of the Cu NMR signal into a central line arising from the central transition, (+\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2}), and two satellite

  lines due to the (\pm\frac{1}{2},\mp\frac{3}{2}) transitions. In addition, the {\cal H}_{\bf hyperfine} term causes a magnetic shift of each line.

We now briefly summarize some properties of the EFG and the magnetic shift tensor. The EFG tensor is a ground-state property of a crystal depending sensitively on the charge distribution in the material. In a semiempirical approach, one assumes that the tensor can be written as the sum of two terms, a _lattice_ and a _valence_ contribution:

\[V_{\alpha\alpha}=V_{\alpha\alpha}^{\rm lat}+V_{\alpha\alpha}^{\rm val}\ .\] (6)

The first contribution arises from all charges outside the ion under consideration. Using the point-charge model, this term is given by

\[V_{ij}^{\rm lat}=[1-\gamma_{\infty}]\ \sum_{k}q_{k}\Bigg{(}\frac{3x_{i}^{k}x_{j}^ {k}-\delta_{ij}|\vec{x}^{k}|^{2}}{|\vec{x}^{k}|^{5}}\Bigg{)},\] (7)

where \gamma_{\infty} is the Sternheimer antishielding factor (approximately 10 for copper nuclei), q_{k} and x_{k} are the charge and the position of the kth ion, respectively.

The second term in Eq. (6) arises from nonfilled shells of the subject ion. In case of Cu^{2+} ions and taking into account only holes in the Cu 3d orbitals, we can write[23]

\[V_{zz}^{\rm val}= -\frac{4}{7}e\langle r^{-3}\rangle_{3d}[n_{3d(x^{2}-y^{2})}-n_{3d (3z^{2}-r^{2})}\] \[+n_{3d(xy)}-\frac{1}{2}n_{3d(xz)}+\frac{1}{2}n_{3d(yz)}]\ ,\] (8)

where n_{3d(x,y,z)} are the number of holes in different 3d orbitals.

Because, in Y-Ba-Cu-O compounds, the positively charged on-site holes predominantly reside on the d orbitals extending towards the negatively charged neighbor oxygen ions, the lattice and valence contributions in Eq. (6) have opposite sign.

The _magnetic_ coupling between the nuclear spin and its electronic environment as expressed by the {\cal H}_{\bf hyperfine} Hamiltonian [Eq. (4)] can be viewed as a coupling of the nuclear spin with a time dependent local magnetic hyperfine field {\bf H}_{L} generated by the electron spin and the electron orbital motion. The static part of {\bf H}_{L} gives rise to a NMR line shift expressed by the _magnetic shift tensor_{\bf K}, whose components, in the x,y,z reference frame, can be decomposed in a spin and an orbital part:

\[K_{\alpha\alpha}(T)=K_{\alpha\alpha}^{\rm spin}(T)+K_{\alpha\alpha}^{\rm orb}\ .\] (9)

The spin part of the magnetic shift is usually called the Knight shift. In the high-T_{c} compounds, {\bf K}^{\rm orb} is predominantly temperature independent, whereas the temperature dependent {\bf K}^{\rm spin} is expected to vanish in the superconducting state due to singlet spin pairing.

Each part of the {\bf K} tensor can be expressed by the respective hyperfine interaction tensor and the static electronic susceptibility as

\[K_{\alpha\alpha}^{\rm spin} = \frac{1}{g\mu_{B}}\sum_{j}(A_{j})_{\alpha\alpha}(\chi_{j})_{ \alpha\alpha},\] (10) \[K_{\alpha\alpha}^{\rm orb} = \frac{1}{\mu_{B}}O_{\alpha\alpha}\chi_{\alpha\alpha}^{\rm orb}\ .\] (11)

The fluctuating part of {\bf H}_{L} is the source of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation. In the case of high-T_{c} compounds, the main contribution to the copper spin-lattice relaxation stems from the electron spin fluctuations. After Moriya,[24] this contribution is related to the imaginary part of the dynamical spin susceptibility, \chi(q,\omega_{0}), and the "relaxation rate per temperature unit," (T_{1}T)^{-1}, is given by

\[\left(\frac{1}{T_{1}T}\right)_{\alpha}=\frac{\gamma_{n}^{2}k_{B}}{2\mu_{B}^{2} }\sum_{q,\alpha^{\prime}\neq\alpha}|A(q)_{\alpha^{\prime}\alpha^{\prime}}|^{2} \frac{\chi_{\alpha^{\prime}\alpha^{\prime}}^{\prime}(q,\omega_{0})}{\omega_{0}},\] (12)

\[A(q)_{\alpha\alpha}=\sum_{j}A_{j,\alpha\alpha}\ {\rm exp}(i{\bf q}\cdot{\bf r}_{j}).\]

Here, \omega_{0} is the nuclear resonance frequency. \alpha denotes the direction of quantization, i.e., the direction of V_{zz} in NQR and of {\bf B}_{0} in NMR experiments, and \alpha^{\prime} is the direction perpendicular to \alpha. {\bf A}_{j} is the on-site ({\bf r}_{j}=0) and the transferred ({\bf r}_{j}\neq 0) hyperfine coupling tensor for the nuclei under consideration. Thus, the "relaxation rate per temperature unit" provides information about the q averaged imaginary part of \chi(q,\omega_{0}).

## III Experiment

The Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} sample, investigated in this work, was prepared by the solid state reaction technique, which is described in detail elsewhere.[25] The sample was calcined twice in oxygen gas (O_{2}) at 20 bar pressure and at 1020 ^{\circ}C during 12 h (reground in between) and postannealed in 100 bar O_{2} at 300 ^{\circ}C during 3 days. Different characterization techniques (x-ray diffraction and TEM) show a pure Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} phase without impurity phases within a detection limit of less than 0.5% by volume. No YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} or YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} phase precipitates were found. The absolute oxygen content of the sample was estimated on the base of the annealing treatment and the determined lattice parameters.[25] Some data for our sample are listed in Table 1.

In order to study the anisotropic properties of the Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} compound, the Cu NMR experiments were carried out on a c-axis oriented powder. The magnetic orienting of the powder, described in Ref. [27], produced a sample with a high degree of c-axis alignment of

  the grains whereas the a and b axes remained randomly distributed.

The ^{63,65}Cu NQR and NMR experiments were carried out using standard pulsed spectrometers. The resonance signals were obtained by a phase alternating add-subtract spin-echo technique similar to that one used in Ref. [28].

The NQR measurements were done in a zero magnetic field. The spectra were obtained by scanning the frequency in discrete steps and integrating the echo signal. The spin-lattice relaxation time T_{1} was measured by NQR using the inversion-recovery pulse sequence.

The NMR experiments were performed in an external magnetic field, {\bf B}_{0}, of 9.03 T using Fourier transformation of the spin echo. In all our experiments we used very intensive radio frequency pulses with optimal pulse lengths of 1.5 \mus or less.

## IV Results and Analysis

### Nqr

The Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}^{63,65}Cu NQR spectrum at 100 K (Fig. 2) looks almost like the combined NQR spectra of the parent compounds YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Ref. [29]) and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}.[5] Therefore, naturally, we assigned the four ^{63}Cu and ^{65}Cu isotope pairs in the Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} NQR spectrum on grounds of their resemblance in frequency and shape with the ones in the parent compounds. The correctness of such a choice is supported by the very similar temperature behavior of corresponding lines in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} and the parent compounds (Fig. 3). However, at closer inspection one notices that in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} the frequency difference between the single- and double-chain Cu lines is somewhat smaller than observed for the parent compounds. The same effect but less pronounced is observed for the plane lines.

One notices further that the lines in the 1-2-4 block are almost as narrow as in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} which demon

[29]) and in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} (dashed line, Ref. [5]).

  strates the structural quality of the 1-2-4 block being comparable to that of good YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}. In contrast, the chain and plane lines in the 1-2-3 block are much broader than corresponding lines in a good quality YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} sample,[30] thus indicating that also in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} the single chain is an imperfect structural element which only under very subtle thermodynamic conditions can be ordered and filled completely with oxygen.

The spin-lattice relaxation rate has been measured by NQR for all four copper sites of Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}. Figure 4 depicts the temperature dependence of (T_{1}T)^{-1} of Cu(2) and Cu(3) together with related data from YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Ref. [31]) and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}.[6] Characteristic for Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} is that (T_{1}T)^{-1} for both planar sites depends strongly on temperature in the normal conducting state showing a maximum at T^{*}=130 K combined with a Curie-Weiss-type behavior above and a strong drop below T^{*}.

The temperature dependence of (T_{1}T)^{-1} for the chain Cu sites is given in Fig. 5. The Cu(4) data are practically identical with the corresponding values in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}, thus demonstrating that the electronic spin dynamics of the double chains is unaffected by the Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} multilattice and therefore remains equal in both compounds. For the Cu(1) data, the agreement with the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} data is less pronounced, partly due to the large scatter of the Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} data. However, above 250 K, the two data sets clearly depart from each other.

### Nmr

Figure 6 shows the central lines of the Cu NMR spectrum obtained for two orientations of the magnetic field, {\bf B}_{0}\parallel{\bf c} and {\bf B}_{0}\perp{\bf c}. The lines are shifted with respect to the Larmor frequency, \nu_{L}, due to quadrupolar and magnetic hyperfine couplings. The quadrupolar as well as the magnetic shift depend on {\bf B}_{0} but in a rather opposite manner: the magnetic shift is proportional to {\bf B}_{0}, the quadrupolar is proportional to {\bf B}_{0}^{-1}. Since we are mainly interested in the magnetic shifts, the spectrum was measured in a high magnetic field [\nu_{L}(^{63}Cu)= 101.916 MHz in CuCl].

In order to determine the {\bf K} values from the asymmetrically broadened experimental multicentral-line spectra we used a line shape model that involves a convolution of a temperature independent Gaussian angular distribution of {\bf c}-axis misalignment, responsible for an asymmetric second-order quadrupolar shift broadening of the resonance lines towards lower frequencies,[32] with a temperature dependent Lorentzian-like broadening present at each existing orientation. By varying the spread of the angular misalignment we achieved the best fit with a quite narrow Gaussian distribution width of only \sim 2.5^{\circ}.

Because of Eq. (5) with \nu_{Q} known from our NQR measurements, the analysis of the shift does not allow an unambiguous determination of eQV_{ZZ}, \eta, and {\bf K}. However, it is known from previous studies[31, 48] that the EFG at the plane Cu sites in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} as well as in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} is nearly axially symmetric with \eta values which are equal within the error limits (Table 2). We assume that the

[33]) and in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} (dashed line, Ref. [5]).**

(b) {\bf B}_{0}\perp{\bf c}. ^{63}Cu(2): dotted and ^{63}Cu(3): dashed. The solid line is the sum of calculated individual lines.**

 \eta values at the Cu(2) and Cu(3) sites in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} are the same as the respective values in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}. This assumption, however, as long not verified, bears an uncertainty in the quadrupolar and consequently in the magnetic shift. To estimate the magnitude of a possible error, we evaluated **K** from the experimental spectrum for a variety of \eta's. The influence of \eta on **K** is quite modest insofar as \eta remains below 0.05, i.e., in the range of values typically observed at plane copper sites. The influence of \eta depends on the orientation of **B_{0}**.

Measurements of plane Cu K_{cc} (**B_{0}\parallel c**) at room temperature were performed on the central transition of the less abundant ^{68}Cu isotope to avoid overlap of the plane Cu(2) and Cu(3) lines with the double-chain Cu(4) line.

The assignment of the various Cu lines in the experimental spectrum [Fig. 6(a)] was facilitated by the appreciable difference in spin-spin relaxation times between chain and plane Cu sites, as known from NQR. The most narrow (20 kHz) and the broadest (\sim 500 kHz) lines in the **B_{0}\parallel c** spectrum belong to the double-chain site ^{68}Cu(4) and the single-chain site ^{68}Cu(1), respectively. The remaining 105 kHz broad line we assigned to a composition of two plane ^{65}Cu(2) and ^{68}Cu(3) lines with slightly different K_{cc} shifts 1.26% and 1.28%, respectively. Even at 11.7 T these two lines could not be resolved. Thus, K_{cc} is _practically equal_ for the two plane copper sites.

In the case of **B_{0}\perp c**, the plane Cu central lines of the more abundant ^{63}Cu isotope spectrum are far apart from the chain Cu lines, therefore preferentially this spectrum was used in the K_{aa} shift determination. As one can see in Fig. 6(b), the two ^{63}Cu(2) and ^{63}Cu(3) central lines are quite well resolved at room temperature. Unfortunately, with decreasing temperature due to the broadening and smaller frequency separation this resolution deteriorates. Taking into account the experimentally determined temperature variation of \nu_{Q}'s shown in Fig. 3 and by using the line shape model for **B_{0}\perp c** orientation, we were able to extract the temperature dependence of the total K_{aa} (=K_{bb}) shifts for Cu(2) and Cu(3). However, to obtain the more relevant temperature dependent spin part **K^{\rm spin}** one has to know the constant orbital part **K^{\rm orb}**, usually obtained as the rest **K** shift at temperatures far below T_{c}. In the case of Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}, as already mentioned, the broadening and the overlap of the two lines prevent an accurate enough determination of **K^{\rm orb}**. Therefore we had to resort on the values obtained by Barrett _et al._ for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Ref. [33]) and by Zimmermann _et al._ for YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}.[6] As one may expect both values agree in er

  ror limits. Thus we took the average value of 0.285% for K^{\rm orb}_{aa}(=K^{\rm orb}_{\rm 86}) of Cu(2) and Cu(3) (Table 3). Subtraction of K^{\rm orb}_{aa} from the respective total K_{aa} then yields the temperature dependent K^{\rm spin}_{aa} for Cu(2) and Cu(3) (Fig. 7).

## 5 Discussion

In this section we first discuss the two major topics of our study, the doping of the CuO_{2} planes and the interplane coupling in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}, and, then, analyze our data in terms of two phenomenological models providing analytical expressions for relaxation and Knight shift which can be readily evaluated.

### Charge-carrier density in the CuO_{2} planes

The EFG tensor [Eq. (8)] and hence \nu_{Q} [Eq. (5)] of the plane copper sites is very sensitive to changes in the density of mobile holes, n, in the CuO_{2} planes. Indeed, the NQR experiments in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Refs. 35 and 36) and La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (Ref. 37) show that \nu_{Q} of the plane copper nuclei shifts towards higher values with increasing n. In the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} family, \nu_{Q} changes from 23.18 MHz in undoped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} (Ref. 38) to 31.53 MHz at 100 K in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.[29] Optimal doping maximizing T_{c} occurs for \delta=0.06.[39] In this sense, YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is overdoped and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} is underdoped. In the La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system, \nu_{Q} increases linearly with Sr doping from 33 MHz for x=0 to 36.2 MHz for x=0.15.

The structural differences between various Y-Ba-Cu-O family members occur only in the CuO chains, leaving the nearest neighborhood of the plane Cu practically unchanged. The effects of these structural changes can be seen best of all via the NQR frequency of the Ba nuclei, \nu_{Q}(Ba). Due to the closed electron shell of the Ba ion, \nu_{Q}(Ba) is exclusively determined by the _lattice_ contribution to the EFG and is as such very sensitive to structural changes. While \nu_{Q}(Ba) in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is still 6% higher than \nu_{Q}(Ba) in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8},[10] the \nu_{Q}(Ba) of these parent substances differ only by 2% from the \nu_{Q}(Ba) of the respective blocks in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}.[40] Therefore it is reasonable to assume that the changes of the EFG and thus \nu_{Q} of plane Cu in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}, and Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} arise predominantly from the changes of the EFG due to different in-plane dopings.

Based on these facts we can estimate n, the hole concentration per plane Cu atom, for the CuO_{2} planes in the 1-2-3 and 1-2-4 blocks, respectively. In analogy to the La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system, we assume that \nu_{Q} of the planar Cu in the Y-Ba-Cu-O compounds increases linearly with n, and use the \nu_{Q} values of Table 2 (for 100 K). This way we find that n of the Cu(2)O_{2} and Cu(3)O_{2} planes in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} is 79 and 98 %, respectively, of the hole concentration found in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, which means that the planes of the 1-2-3 block are more heavily doped than the planes of the 1-2-4 block. The doping levels do not change much with temperature since the variation of the corresponding \nu_{Q} values with temperature is small.

To be quantitative, we calibrate the \nu_{Q}-vs-n relation by assigning \nu_{Q} of Cu(2) in undoped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} to n=0 and by taking the formal 0.33 holes/Cu atom for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} as the n value corresponding to \nu_{Q}=31.53 MHz. We thus obtain d\nu_{Q}/dn=23.4 MHz/hole which compares well with the value 21 MHz/hole derived from La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} data.[37] The 23.4 MHz/hole value then yields hole concentrations of 0.325 and 0.262 for the planes in the 1-2-3 and 1-2-4 blocks of Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}, respectively, and a concentration of 0.259 for YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} planes. As suspected, the last two values are very close to the formal 0.25 holes/Cu atom in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}.

The finding of different hole concentrations in the 1-2-3 and 1-2-4 blocks is qualitatively supported by plane Cu spin-lattice relaxation rate, W, and Knight shift data. It is now widely agreed that the relaxation at plane Cu sites is primarily caused by antiferromagnetic (AF) electron spin fluctuations which, according to neutron scattering experiments, get progressively suppressed by growing charge carrier density.[41] Hence, the room temperature relaxation rate in Y-Ba-Cu-O monotonically decreases with increasing CuO_{2} plane doping.[42, 43, 44] Assuming that the same tendency holds for Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}, it follows from the Cu(2) and Cu(3) relaxation data that the 1-2-3 block has a higher doping level than the 1-2-4 block. Furthermore, at high temperature where the temperature dependence of W[Cu(2)] and W[Cu(3)] levels off, W[Cu(3)] agrees quite well with that of Cu(2) in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}, indicating an equal charge carrier density in corresponding planes. The agreement of the Cu(2) relaxation rates in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and in the 1-2-3 block is somewhat poorer. The slightly higher rate in the 1-2-3 block may be an indication of a somewhat lower doping level in this block.

In contrast to the relaxation rate, the Knight shift K^{\rm spin}_{aa} in (Y,Pr)Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7},[44] YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta},[45] and in TlBa_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} (Ref. 46) grows with increasing n. In Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} the 1-2-3 block exhibits a larger shift than the 1-2-4 block (Fig. 7), which again supports the con

Figure 7: Temperature dependence of the plane ^{63}Cu Knight shift at Cu(2) (open circles) and Cu(3) sites (filled circles) in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} compared to the Knight shift at Cu(2) sites in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (dash-dotted line, Ref. 34) and in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} (dashed line, Ref. 6). The external field {\bf B}_{0} lies perpendicular to the crystal {\bf c} axis.

  clusion of a higher plane doping level in the 1-2-3 block as compared to the 1-2-4 block.

Summarizing the preceding findings, the multilattice compound Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} turns out to be a structure containing _planes of differing doping level_. The planes in the 1-2-4 block (1-2-3 block) are slightly higher (lower) doped than those in the corresponding parent compounds.

### Coupling of CuO_{2} planes above T_{c}

In Figs. 4 and 7 we compare the temperature dependences of the relaxation rate, W, and of the spin part of the magnetic shift, K_{aa}^{\rm spin}, measured in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} with corresponding values of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}. For both, W and K_{aa}^{\rm spin}, the respective values coincide above 300 K, whereas in the range between T_{c} and 300 K the Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} data show a temperature variation which appreciably differs from that observed for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} as well as YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} data. The relaxation rates together with the Knight shifts of each plane of the double plane exhibit a temperature dependence typical for an underdoped high-T_{c} superconductor. Furthermore, as evident from Fig. 8, in the normal conducting state at temperatures above 100 K, a constant relaxation rate ratio r_{W}=W[{\rm Cu}(3)]/W[{\rm Cu}(2)]=1.28(7) together with a constant shift ratio r_{K}=K_{aa}^{\rm spin}[{\rm Cu}(3)]/K_{aa}^{\rm spin}[{\rm Cu}(2)]=0.90(6) are observed.

According to Eq. (10) and Eq. (12), the temperature independent r_{K} and r_{W} imply a temperature independent relationship between the respective static and dynamic electronic spin susceptibilities. The relaxation rate, strictly speaking, involves the q averaged imaginary part of \chi(q,\omega_{0}). However, if we assume that the spin fluctuations at the corner of the Brillouin zone, q=Q_{AF}, dominate the relaxation, the sum over q can be replaced by \chi^{\prime\prime}(Q_{AF}). The plane copper hyperfine constants appearing in the ratios are alike in Y-Ba-Cu-O compounds [47, 48] and seem to be temperature independent. In other words, both the static and the dynamic electron susceptibilities of the two single planes of each double plane are governed by the _same_ temperature dependence which means common spin dynamics in both planes, and hence these planes must be strongly coupled. However, since r_{K} and r_{W} are not equal, the q dependence of the susceptibility is not the same in the two planes.

A strong interplane coupling was recently observed by neutron scattering in the insulating antiferromagnetic YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} (Ref. [18]) and in superconducting YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6} (Ref. [19]) and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}[20]. In YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}, the large interplane exchange coupling (with coupling constant of about 15 meV) orders the next-nearest CuO_{2} planes antiferromagnetically below the Neel temperature, T_{N}. In YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6} and in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} a similar interplane coupling produces strong AF electron spin-spin correlations which persist from the normal into the superconducting state. Note, however, that the coupled planes in these compounds are _equivalent_ in contrast to those in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}.

At the moment the mechanism of interplane coupling in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} is not known. Direct and indirect exchange interactions are possible candidates. Because of the relatively large interplane distance of 3.2 A a direct exchange between the small Cu 3d_{3z^{\prime}\to z^{\prime}} orbitals seems to be less likely and probably an indirect superexchange via oxygen and yttrium must be invoked. The coupling _strength_ may be estimated from the K_{aa}^{\rm spin}-vs-temperature plot (Fig. 7). Below 300 K, the K_{aa}^{\rm spin} shifts in the 1-2-3 and 1-2-4 blocks begin to depart from those in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} due to the interplane coupling, thus the coupling strength is not much less than k_{B}\times 300 K or 30 meV.

The strong AF interplane correlations observed in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6} and in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} by neutron experiments are presumably present also in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}. Then, as pointed out by Tranquada _et al._, [19] the correlations impose restrictions on the charge-carrier movement which has to be of a special kind, most probably coherent in both planes to retain the interplane spin-spin correlations.

Irrespective of its nature, the question remains whether the interplane coupling favors or impedes superconductivity. Several theories of high-T_{c} superconductivity incorporate the interplane coupling as an essential ingredient. In the theory of Anderson, [49] only the interplane pair tunneling between coupled planes makes superconductivity possible. Altshuler and Ioffe [50] stress the importance of interplane correlations, arguing that they are essential for the system to become superconducting. The possibility of (nodeless) d-wave superconductivity in a double-plane model is predicted by Bulut _et al._[51] and by Dagotto _et al._[52] Morgenstern _et al._[53] find evidence of d-wave superconductivity in their Monte Carlo simulations of the double-plane Hubbard model.

To our knowledge, none of the theories taking into account interplane coupling find it unfavorable for superconductivity. On the other hand, Eenige _et al._[54] claim that the occurrence of superconductivity in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} is due to the proximity effect rather than to an interplane coupling. Their argument is based on a

Figure 8: Temperature dependence of the ratio of plane copper (a) relaxation rates and (b) Knight shifts in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}.

  kink seen in the pressure dependence of T_{c}. In order to explain a T_{c} being higher than in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} and even YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, the authors, however, are forced to postulate an extra doping via interstitial oxygen.

Our experiments, however, clearly demonstrate the presence of an interplane coupling in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}. Obviously, we cannot tell whether this coupling favors or impedes superconductivity. Nevertheless, our result fits into the framework of several theories favoring interplane coupling (see, for instance, Ref. [55]).

A final comment concerns the high value of T_{c}. As pointed out in the preceding section, the 1-2-3 block in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} is close to or even at optimal doping for the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} structure. Thus it is tempting to assume that the "best plane," namely that of the 1-2-3 block, determines T_{c}. However, this argument fails for a composition of Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} which yields a T_{c} of 95 K since, to our knowledge, the T_{c} values of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} do not exceed 93 K. Thus, it is conceivable that the interplane coupling plays a role in obtaining high-T_{c} values. NMR-NQR experiments on Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} samples with T_{c}=95 K may perhaps provide answers to this issue.

### Interplane coupling below T_{c}

Next we will discuss briefly the relevance of the temperature dependence of W and K_{aa}^{\rm spin} close and below T_{c}. Just above T_{c}, r_{W} begins to diminish with decreasing temperature. After smoothly passing into the superconducting state it decreases to a minimum of 1.0 at 80 K, where it starts to increase again. In contrast, r_{K} remains constant down to T_{c}, where it starts to increase. Unfortunately, the overlap of Cu(2) and Cu(3) lines prevents measurements of r_{K} below 76 K. Both ratios have the same value, namely 1.0, around 80 K which is close to T_{c} of YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}. Whether this is purely accidental remains an open question.

The variation of r_{W} and r_{K} with temperature in the superconducting state means that the susceptibilities of the individual planes of the double plane have lost their common temperature dependence. It is tempting to assume a weakening or even loss of the interplane coupling as the underlying cause. This, however, would contradict the results of neutron scattering experiments in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6} (Ref. [19]) and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7},[20] where no significant change of the interplane correlation at and below T_{c} is observed. There is also evidence for strong coupling between the superconducting CuO_{2} planes in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} from single-crystal transport measurements.[56]

Another reason why the common temperature dependence disappears could be a formation of two superconducting gaps that differ in the individual planes because of their different charge-carrier densities, n. However, up to now even the spatial symmetry of the superconducting state in Y-Ba-Cu-O and so the form of the superconducting gap is not well established, let alone its dependence on n. Thus, the explanation of the temperature variation of r_{W} and r_{K} below T_{c} is still missing.

### Relaxation and Knight shift mechanisms

The crucial point in deriving the spin-lattice relaxation rate [Eq. (12)] and the Knight shift [Eq. (10)] is the calculation of the susceptibility, \chi(q,\omega_{0}). In the absence of a complete understanding of the electronic state of Y-Ba-Cu-O superconductors, approximations must be introduced.

In the phenomenological model of Millis, Monien, and Pines (MMP),[57, 3]\chi(q,\omega_{0}) is treated in a mean-field approximation and it is decomposed into a quasiparticle (normal Fermi-liquid-like) contribution and a contribution arising from AF correlations. The MMP model gives a quantitative account of relaxation data at Cu, O, and Y sites in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Ref. [57]) and at Cu(2) sites in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} (Ref. [10]) provided the square of the correlation length of the AF fluctuations, \xi^{2}, has approximately a Curie-Weiss-like temperature dependence. Since neutron scattering investigations[18] concluded that \xi is temperature independent the applicability of the MMP model has been questioned.

A different approach to explain the anomalous temperature dependence of the relaxation rate has been suggested by Millis and Monien.[58] From their analysis of relaxation data, they concluded that the spectral weight in the spin fluctuations decreases as the temperature is lowered. This missing spectral weight must reappear at a higher energy in the form of a transition over a "spin pseudogap," \Delta. Thus, there are two competing effects which determine the variation of T_{1} with temperature: the increase of AF fluctuations with falling temperature and the spin-gap effect. At a certain temperature the spin-gap effect wins and (T_{1}T)^{-1} starts to decrease. The widespread nature of the spin-gap effect has been noted by Rice.[59]

After the discovery of the spin-gap effect in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} by neutron scattering[60] several NMR groups have regarded the spin-gap effect to be responsible for the peculiar temperature variation of the relaxation rate, at least in the normal conducting state.[3] The relaxation rate is described by an _ad hoc_ formula:

\[\frac{1}{T_{1}T}=\left(\frac{A_{0}}{T}\right)^{\alpha}\left[1-\tanh^{2}\left( \frac{\Delta_{\rm AF}}{2T}\right)\right].\] (13)

Here, \Delta_{\rm AF} denotes the spin-gap energy at the Q_{\rm AF}=(\frac{\pi}{a},\frac{\pi}{a}) since the Cu relaxation is dominated by the strong AF fluctuations around Q_{\rm AF}.[57]A_{0} is a constant and the factor T^{-\alpha} guarantees a reasonable description for the high-temperature behavior and may be attributed to the gradual decay of AF correlations at higher temperatures.[57] Some applications of Eq. (13) to both Knight shift and relaxation rates are discussed in Refs. [61] and [62].

Figure 9 shows the fit of Eq. (13) to the Cu(2) and Cu(3) relaxation rates in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}. The parameters for both fits are \Delta_{\rm AF}=240(20) K and \alpha=1.25 which within the error limits agree with \Delta_{\rm AF}=260(10) K and \alpha=1.25 we obtained for YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} using our previous Cu(2) data.[6] This result again demonstrates the dominating role played by the double-chain block

 in Y2Ba4Cu7O15. A similar relaxation rate behavior of plane copper is observed for the bulk oxygen deficient YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (_d_ >0.06) material.[42]

The spin shift data are fitted by a similar _ad hoc_ expression:

\[K_{aa}^{\rm spin}(T)=K_{0}^{\rm spin}\left[1-\tanh^{2}\left(\frac{\Delta_{0}}{ 2T}\right)\right],\] (14)

where D0 is the spin-gap energy at q = (0,0). Equation (14) describes quite well K_{aa}^{\rm spin}(T) in the normal conducting state. For Y2Ba4Cu7O15, the fit yields for both blocks a common D0 = 150(20) K and two separate prefactors: K_{0}^{\rm spin}=0.290\% for the 1-2-3 and K_{0}^{\rm spin}=0.260\% for the 1-2-4 block. The same fit procedure applied to YBa2Cu4O8 data yields D0 = 210(20) K and K_{0}^{\rm spin}=0.267\%. Provided the temperature variation of the Knight shift arises from a spin-gap opening and Eq. (14) represents an appropriate description of this effect, then the results imply, first, that a spin gap, D0, opens at q = (0,0) and, second, that D0 is smaller than D_AF.

We conclude this section by mentioning a completely different approach[63] to interpret the plane Cu relaxation rate. The high-_T_c superconducting compound is viewed as a dilute system of neutral holes in an antiferromagnet that tends to separate into hole-rich and hole-poor phases, but is frustrated by long-range Coulomb interactions. As a consequence, large-amplitude local hole density fluctuations occur and their interaction with the mobile holes determines the normal conducting state properties. By approximating the fluctuations with a single-mode spin-1 excitation of wave vector _Q_AF and energy _ph__g_, Emery and Kivelson[63] deduced for the relaxation rate the following expression:

\[\frac{1}{T_{1}T}=\frac{C_{0}}{T}\left[4+\exp\left(\frac{\omega_{g}}{kT}\right) +3\exp\left(-\frac{\omega_{g}}{kT}\right)\right]^{-1}\ ,\] (15)

where C0 is a constant. As seen in Fig. 9, this formula allows quite a good fit to the plane Cu relaxation data, delivering _ph__g_ = 250(10) K for Y2Ba4Cu7O15 and 270(10) K for YBa2Cu4O8.

We like to stress that we have restricted our discussion of relaxation and Knight shift data to the previous two models only simply for the fact that Eqs. (13)-(15) contain parameters easely obtained by fitting the data. However, it is obvious that one cannot discriminate between these two models on the basis of our NMR experiments only.

## VI Summary

We have reported the first observation of Cu NQR-NMR in Y2Ba4Cu7O15. In zero magnetic field we have measured the temperature dependence of the copper NQR frequency and spin-lattice relaxation at all four chemically inequivalent copper sites. In a 9.03 T magnetic field applied parallel and perpendicular to the **c** axis of an oriented powder sample, we have determined the temperature dependence of the copper magnetic shift at the two inequivalent plane copper sites.

The Y2Ba4Cu7O15 compound turns out to be a structure containing two inequivalent CuO2 planes of differing doping levels. Thus, Y2Ba4Cu7O15 is the first double-plane cuprate where the interplane coupling could be accessed by Cu NMR-NQR studies.

In the normal conducting state, both the static and the dynamic electron spin susceptibilities of the individual planes of a double plane are governed by the _same_ temperature dependence. This means a common spin dynamics in both planes, and hence these planes must be strongly coupled. The estimated lower limit of the corresponding interplane coupling is not much less than 30 meV. Although the planes are strongly coupled, their spin susceptibilities retain a distinct q dependence. The temperature dependence itself is typical for an underdoped high-_T_c compound.

Below _T_c, the common temperature dependence is lost, which could arise from the opening of two superconducting gaps that differ in the individual planes, thus manifesting the different plane charge carrier densities of the 1-2-4 and 1-2-3 blocks.

Two models were used to fit the experimental data in the normal conducting phase. The temperature variation of both the relaxation rate and the Knight shift at planar sites can be described as the effect of the opening of a spin gap yielding spin-gap values of 240 K and 150 K at wave vectors _Q_AF = (\frac{\pi}{a}, \frac{\pi}{a}) and q = (0,0), respectively. The corresponding values for YBa2Cu4O8 are \Delta_{\rm AF} = 260 K and \Delta_{0} = 210 K.

Applying the "frustrated phase separation" model due to Emery and Kivelson to the planar Cu relaxation in

Figure 9: The fits of Eq. (13) (dashed lines) and of Eq. (15) (dotted lines) to the measured Cu(2) (open circles) and Cu(3) (filled circles) relaxation rates in Y2Ba4Cu7O15. The parameters (for both sites) are Δ_AF = 240 K and \alpha = 1.25 for Eq. (13) and _ω__g_ = 250 K for Eq. (15).

  Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} yields 250 K for the large-amplitude low-energy \omega_{g} fluctuations of the local hole density. Since both models allow fits that remain well in the limits of the experimental error bars, a discrimination of these models on the basis of presently available experimental data is not possible.

###### Abstract

We report an observation of the ^{63,65}Cu nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}. We have measured the temperature dependence of the Cu NQR frequency and spin-lattice relaxation at all four chemically inequivalent Cu sites, and of the Cu magnetic shift at two inequivalent plane Cu sites (for the magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to the e axis). The Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} compound turns out to be a structure containing two inequivalent CuO_{2} planes of differing doping levels, a multilattice in which YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} blocks and YBa_{2}Cu_{5}O_{7} blocks alternate. In the normal conducting state both the static and the dynamic electron spin susceptibilities of the individual planes of a double plane are governed by the _same_ temperature dependence, which shows a behavior typical for an underdoped high-T_{c} compound. The same temperature dependence means strong coupling between these planes, with the lower limit of the coupling constant not much less than 30 meV. Although the planes are strongly coupled, their spin susceptibilities retain a distinct q dependence. The temperature variation of relaxation rate and Knight shift is described in terms of spin-gap formation or, alternatively, of frustrated phase separation. Below T_{c}, the common temperature dependence is lost, which could arise from the opening of two superconducting gaps that differ in the individual planes.

## I Introduction

The understanding of the electron spin correlations and their possible interplay with superconductivity in the complex high-T_{c} copper oxides have attracted considerable interest, since both aspects are of great importance for an adequate description of these materials. Over the last several years the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) have played a vital and significant role in the study of the low-frequency spectrum of the spin fluctuations by probing the wave-vector (q) and frequency (\omega) dependent spin susceptibility, \chi(q,\omega). Relevant information can be gained from the temperature dependence of both the magnetic shift tensor, and the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate at different atomic sites.[1, 2, 3]

Of special interest and importance are, among others, the CuO_{2} double planes, that characterize a whole class of high-T_{c} compounds. Each of these double planes consists of a pair of closely spaced adjacent CuO_{2} planes which are present in almost all high-T_{c} superconductors and where the superconductivity takes place.[4]

From the high-T_{c} compounds having CuO_{2} double planes, the most intensively studied so far is YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} for which now NMR-NQR data are available for all sites in the crystal structure.[1] Many of our NMR and NQR investigations[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] have focused on another double-plane structure, namely the YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} compound[11] that is distinguished by its high thermal stability and precise stoichiometry which leads to well-defined samples with respect to their oxygen content. Their structural homogeneity is reflected by very narrow [63, 65]Cu NQR lines.[5] The lower T_{c} of the YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} compound, 82 K, compared to that of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, 92 K, can be qualitatively accounted for by its lower doping level. The main difference in the crystallographic structure of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} is the double CuO chain in the latter.

Here we report in detail NQR and NMR measurements in the compound Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15},[10, 3, 12] which can be considered as a natural multilattice (Fig. 1), consisting of alternating YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} (1-2-4 for short) and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (1-2-3) blocks containing double and single CuO chains, respectively.[13] The Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} compound has been synthesized under high-O_{2} pressure by Karpinski and Kaldis.[14] However, single-phase samples can also be obtained under normal O_{2} pressure.[15] By changing the oxygen content, T_{c} can be varied between 14 K and 95 K,[16, 17] which is the highest T_{c} reached so far in the Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{6+n}O_{14+n} family. Thus, one of the fundamental questions concerning this compound is why its T_{c} is larger than the T_{c} of the parent compounds.

Our results reveal, among others, the existence of a strong coupling between the adjacent CuO_{2} planes of _one double plane_. Such a coupling was found previously in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6},[18] YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6},[19] and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Ref. 20) by neutron scattering experiments. In addition, we conclude that the alternating blocks are doped at different levels.

 The unit cell of Y2Ba4Cu7O15 contains _four_ chemically inequivalent Cu sites: the Cu(1) chain and the Cu(2) plane sites of the 1-2-3 block and the Cu(3) plane and the Cu(4) chain sites of the 1-2-4 block. As in the YBa2Cu3O7 and YBa2Cu4O8 compounds, the CuO2 planes in Y2Ba4Cu7O15 form double planes separated by Y ions. However, due to the alternation of 1-2-4 and 1-2-3 blocks, the double planes in Y2Ba4Cu7O15 consist of two _inequivalent_ CuO2 planes thus allowing one to study the coupling between such planes.

The lattice constants a and b nearly do not change upon going from YBa2Cu4O8 to Y2Ba4Cu7O18, thus suggesting that the rigid 1-2-4 block determines the basal lattice constants of Y2Ba4Cu7O15. This suggestion is supported by the fact that the a, b, and c constants of Y2Ba4Cu7O15, in contrast to those of YBa2Cu3O7, only slightly depend on the oxygen content. This might also be responsible for the oxygen disorder in the single chains of the 1-2-3 block. Neutron experiments for oxygen deficient samples [21] revealed that a certain number of single chains are lying in the a direction which is perpendicular to the double chains. However, for the high-oxygen content sample, as reported here, there is no misorientation in the single chain [17].

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section contains the necessary theoretical NMR-NQR background. Experimental procedures, including the characterization of the sample, are given in Sec. III. In Sec. IV we present our data, in Sec. V we discuss our results and compare them with neutron diffraction data and theoretical models. The paper concludes with a summary in Sec. VI.

## II NMR-NQR Theory

A nuclear spin interacts with its electronic environment through electric and magnetic hyperfine couplings [22]. In the presence of an applied magnetic field, {\bf B}_{0}, the Hamiltonian of a nuclear spin, {\bf I}, having a quadrupole moment, eQ, can be written as

\[{\cal H}={\cal H}_{\rm Zeeman}+{\cal H}_{\rm quadrupole}+{\cal H}_{\rm hyperfine}\] (1)

with

\[{\cal H}_{\rm Zeeman}= -\gamma_{n}\hbar B_{0}[I_{x}\cos\theta\] \[+I_{y}\sin\theta\sin\phi+I_{x}\sin\theta\cos\theta]\ ,\] (2) \[{\cal H}_{\rm quadrupole}=\frac{eQV_{xs}}{4I(2I-1)}\left(3I_{x}^{2} -I(I+1)+\frac{\eta}{2}(I_{+}^{2}+I_{-}^{2})\right)\ ,\] (3)

and

\[{\cal H}_{\rm hyperfine}=\,\gamma_{n}\hbar\Bigg{(}\sum_{j}{\bf I}\cdot{\bf A}_{ j}\cdot{\bf S}_{j}+{\bf I}\cdot{\bf O}\cdot{\bf L}\Bigg{)}\ .\] (4)

Here, V_{\alpha\alpha} (\alpha =x,y,z) denote the principal components of the electric field gradient (EFG) tensor {\bf V}, with the axes labeled according to the convention |V_{xs}|\leq|V_{yy}|\leq|V_{xs}|. The asymmetry parameter of {\bf V}, \eta, is defined as \eta=(V_{xs}-V_{yy})/V_{xs}, \eta\in[0,1]. For a particular site, x,y,z are chosen as the frame of reference in Eqs. (1)-(4). In all Y-Ba-Cu-O compounds due to symmetry, one permutation of the x,y,z set coincides with the orthorhombic {\bf a}, {\bf b}, and {\bf c} crystal axes. \theta and \phi are the polar and azimuthal angles, respectively, of {\bf B}_{0} in this crystal frame. {\bf S}_{j} is the electron spin operator at the copper site j and {\bf A}_{j} is its spin hyperfine tensor, the sum over j includes only on-site copper and its first neighbors. {\bf L} is the electron orbital angular momentum and {\bf O} is its on-site orbital hyperfine tensor. \gamma_{n} is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio.

In the absence of an applied or an internal static magnetic field, the remaining {\cal H}_{\rm quadrupole} gives rise to doubly degenerate energy levels between which NQR transitions can be induced. For copper, there exist two naturally occurring isotopes ^{63}Cu and ^{65}Cu both having spin \frac{3}{2} and thus two doubly degenerate \pm\frac{1}{2} and \pm\frac{3}{2} energy levels. For each isotope, a transition between these levels yields a single NQR signal at frequency

\[^{63,65}\nu_{Q}=\frac{e^{63,65}Q\ V_{xs}}{2\hbar}\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{3}\eta^{2} }\ .\] (5)

In the presence of a large external magnetic field, {\bf B}_{0}, {\cal H}_{\rm quadrupole} causes, for each isotope and each site, a splitting of the Cu NMR signal into a central line arising from the central transition, (+\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2}), and two satellite

  lines due to the (\pm\frac{1}{2},\mp\frac{3}{2}) transitions. In addition, the {\cal H}_{\bf hyperfine} term causes a magnetic shift of each line.

We now briefly summarize some properties of the EFG and the magnetic shift tensor. The EFG tensor is a ground-state property of a crystal depending sensitively on the charge distribution in the material. In a semiempirical approach, one assumes that the tensor can be written as the sum of two terms, a _lattice_ and a _valence_ contribution:

\[V_{\alpha\alpha}=V_{\alpha\alpha}^{\rm lat}+V_{\alpha\alpha}^{\rm val}\ .\] (6)

The first contribution arises from all charges outside the ion under consideration. Using the point-charge model, this term is given by

\[V_{ij}^{\rm lat}=[1-\gamma_{\infty}]\ \sum_{k}q_{k}\Bigg{(}\frac{3x_{i}^{k}x_{j}^ {k}-\delta_{ij}|\vec{x}^{k}|^{2}}{|\vec{x}^{k}|^{5}}\Bigg{)},\] (7)

where \gamma_{\infty} is the Sternheimer antishielding factor (approximately 10 for copper nuclei), q_{k} and x_{k} are the charge and the position of the kth ion, respectively.

The second term in Eq. (6) arises from nonfilled shells of the subject ion. In case of Cu^{2+} ions and taking into account only holes in the Cu 3d orbitals, we can write[23]

\[V_{zz}^{\rm val}= -\frac{4}{7}e\langle r^{-3}\rangle_{3d}[n_{3d(x^{2}-y^{2})}-n_{3d (3z^{2}-r^{2})}\] \[+n_{3d(xy)}-\frac{1}{2}n_{3d(xz)}+\frac{1}{2}n_{3d(yz)}]\ ,\] (8)

where n_{3d(x,y,z)} are the number of holes in different 3d orbitals.

Because, in Y-Ba-Cu-O compounds, the positively charged on-site holes predominantly reside on the d orbitals extending towards the negatively charged neighbor oxygen ions, the lattice and valence contributions in Eq. (6) have opposite sign.

The _magnetic_ coupling between the nuclear spin and its electronic environment as expressed by the {\cal H}_{\bf hyperfine} Hamiltonian [Eq. (4)] can be viewed as a coupling of the nuclear spin with a time dependent local magnetic hyperfine field {\bf H}_{L} generated by the electron spin and the electron orbital motion. The static part of {\bf H}_{L} gives rise to a NMR line shift expressed by the _magnetic shift tensor_{\bf K}, whose components, in the x,y,z reference frame, can be decomposed in a spin and an orbital part:

\[K_{\alpha\alpha}(T)=K_{\alpha\alpha}^{\rm spin}(T)+K_{\alpha\alpha}^{\rm orb}\ .\] (9)

The spin part of the magnetic shift is usually called the Knight shift. In the high-T_{c} compounds, {\bf K}^{\rm orb} is predominantly temperature independent, whereas the temperature dependent {\bf K}^{\rm spin} is expected to vanish in the superconducting state due to singlet spin pairing.

Each part of the {\bf K} tensor can be expressed by the respective hyperfine interaction tensor and the static electronic susceptibility as

\[K_{\alpha\alpha}^{\rm spin} = \frac{1}{g\mu_{B}}\sum_{j}(A_{j})_{\alpha\alpha}(\chi_{j})_{ \alpha\alpha},\] (10) \[K_{\alpha\alpha}^{\rm orb} = \frac{1}{\mu_{B}}O_{\alpha\alpha}\chi_{\alpha\alpha}^{\rm orb}\ .\] (11)

The fluctuating part of {\bf H}_{L} is the source of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation. In the case of high-T_{c} compounds, the main contribution to the copper spin-lattice relaxation stems from the electron spin fluctuations. After Moriya,[24] this contribution is related to the imaginary part of the dynamical spin susceptibility, \chi(q,\omega_{0}), and the "relaxation rate per temperature unit," (T_{1}T)^{-1}, is given by

\[\left(\frac{1}{T_{1}T}\right)_{\alpha}=\frac{\gamma_{n}^{2}k_{B}}{2\mu_{B}^{2} }\sum_{q,\alpha^{\prime}\neq\alpha}|A(q)_{\alpha^{\prime}\alpha^{\prime}}|^{2} \frac{\chi_{\alpha^{\prime}\alpha^{\prime}}^{\prime}(q,\omega_{0})}{\omega_{0}},\] (12)

\[A(q)_{\alpha\alpha}=\sum_{j}A_{j,\alpha\alpha}\ {\rm exp}(i{\bf q}\cdot{\bf r}_{j}).\]

Here, \omega_{0} is the nuclear resonance frequency. \alpha denotes the direction of quantization, i.e., the direction of V_{zz} in NQR and of {\bf B}_{0} in NMR experiments, and \alpha^{\prime} is the direction perpendicular to \alpha. {\bf A}_{j} is the on-site ({\bf r}_{j}=0) and the transferred ({\bf r}_{j}\neq 0) hyperfine coupling tensor for the nuclei under consideration. Thus, the "relaxation rate per temperature unit" provides information about the q averaged imaginary part of \chi(q,\omega_{0}).

## III Experiment

The Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} sample, investigated in this work, was prepared by the solid state reaction technique, which is described in detail elsewhere.[25] The sample was calcined twice in oxygen gas (O_{2}) at 20 bar pressure and at 1020 ^{\circ}C during 12 h (reground in between) and postannealed in 100 bar O_{2} at 300 ^{\circ}C during 3 days. Different characterization techniques (x-ray diffraction and TEM) show a pure Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} phase without impurity phases within a detection limit of less than 0.5% by volume. No YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} or YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} phase precipitates were found. The absolute oxygen content of the sample was estimated on the base of the annealing treatment and the determined lattice parameters.[25] Some data for our sample are listed in Table 1.

In order to study the anisotropic properties of the Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} compound, the Cu NMR experiments were carried out on a c-axis oriented powder. The magnetic orienting of the powder, described in Ref. [27], produced a sample with a high degree of c-axis alignment of

  the grains whereas the a and b axes remained randomly distributed.

The ^{63,65}Cu NQR and NMR experiments were carried out using standard pulsed spectrometers. The resonance signals were obtained by a phase alternating add-subtract spin-echo technique similar to that one used in Ref. [28].

The NQR measurements were done in a zero magnetic field. The spectra were obtained by scanning the frequency in discrete steps and integrating the echo signal. The spin-lattice relaxation time T_{1} was measured by NQR using the inversion-recovery pulse sequence.

The NMR experiments were performed in an external magnetic field, {\bf B}_{0}, of 9.03 T using Fourier transformation of the spin echo. In all our experiments we used very intensive radio frequency pulses with optimal pulse lengths of 1.5 \mus or less.

## IV Results and Analysis

### Nqr

The Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}^{63,65}Cu NQR spectrum at 100 K (Fig. 2) looks almost like the combined NQR spectra of the parent compounds YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Ref. [29]) and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}.[5] Therefore, naturally, we assigned the four ^{63}Cu and ^{65}Cu isotope pairs in the Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} NQR spectrum on grounds of their resemblance in frequency and shape with the ones in the parent compounds. The correctness of such a choice is supported by the very similar temperature behavior of corresponding lines in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} and the parent compounds (Fig. 3). However, at closer inspection one notices that in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} the frequency difference between the single- and double-chain Cu lines is somewhat smaller than observed for the parent compounds. The same effect but less pronounced is observed for the plane lines.

One notices further that the lines in the 1-2-4 block are almost as narrow as in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} which demon

[29]) and in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} (dashed line, Ref. [5]).

  strates the structural quality of the 1-2-4 block being comparable to that of good YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}. In contrast, the chain and plane lines in the 1-2-3 block are much broader than corresponding lines in a good quality YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} sample,[30] thus indicating that also in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} the single chain is an imperfect structural element which only under very subtle thermodynamic conditions can be ordered and filled completely with oxygen.

The spin-lattice relaxation rate has been measured by NQR for all four copper sites of Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}. Figure 4 depicts the temperature dependence of (T_{1}T)^{-1} of Cu(2) and Cu(3) together with related data from YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Ref. [31]) and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}.[6] Characteristic for Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} is that (T_{1}T)^{-1} for both planar sites depends strongly on temperature in the normal conducting state showing a maximum at T^{*}=130 K combined with a Curie-Weiss-type behavior above and a strong drop below T^{*}.

The temperature dependence of (T_{1}T)^{-1} for the chain Cu sites is given in Fig. 5. The Cu(4) data are practically identical with the corresponding values in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}, thus demonstrating that the electronic spin dynamics of the double chains is unaffected by the Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} multilattice and therefore remains equal in both compounds. For the Cu(1) data, the agreement with the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} data is less pronounced, partly due to the large scatter of the Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} data. However, above 250 K, the two data sets clearly depart from each other.

### Nmr

Figure 6 shows the central lines of the Cu NMR spectrum obtained for two orientations of the magnetic field, {\bf B}_{0}\parallel{\bf c} and {\bf B}_{0}\perp{\bf c}. The lines are shifted with respect to the Larmor frequency, \nu_{L}, due to quadrupolar and magnetic hyperfine couplings. The quadrupolar as well as the magnetic shift depend on {\bf B}_{0} but in a rather opposite manner: the magnetic shift is proportional to {\bf B}_{0}, the quadrupolar is proportional to {\bf B}_{0}^{-1}. Since we are mainly interested in the magnetic shifts, the spectrum was measured in a high magnetic field [\nu_{L}(^{63}Cu)= 101.916 MHz in CuCl].

In order to determine the {\bf K} values from the asymmetrically broadened experimental multicentral-line spectra we used a line shape model that involves a convolution of a temperature independent Gaussian angular distribution of {\bf c}-axis misalignment, responsible for an asymmetric second-order quadrupolar shift broadening of the resonance lines towards lower frequencies,[32] with a temperature dependent Lorentzian-like broadening present at each existing orientation. By varying the spread of the angular misalignment we achieved the best fit with a quite narrow Gaussian distribution width of only \sim 2.5^{\circ}.

Because of Eq. (5) with \nu_{Q} known from our NQR measurements, the analysis of the shift does not allow an unambiguous determination of eQV_{ZZ}, \eta, and {\bf K}. However, it is known from previous studies[31, 48] that the EFG at the plane Cu sites in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} as well as in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} is nearly axially symmetric with \eta values which are equal within the error limits (Table 2). We assume that the

[33]) and in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} (dashed line, Ref. [5]).**

 \eta values at the Cu(2) and Cu(3) sites in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} are the same as the respective values in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}. This assumption, however, as long not verified, bears an uncertainty in the quadrupolar and consequently in the magnetic shift. To estimate the magnitude of a possible error, we evaluated **K** from the experimental spectrum for a variety of \eta's. The influence of \eta on **K** is quite modest insofar as \eta remains below 0.05, i.e., in the range of values typically observed at plane copper sites. The influence of \eta depends on the orientation of **B_{0}**.

Measurements of plane Cu K_{cc} (**B_{0}\parallel c**) at room temperature were performed on the central transition of the less abundant ^{68}Cu isotope to avoid overlap of the plane Cu(2) and Cu(3) lines with the double-chain Cu(4) line.

The assignment of the various Cu lines in the experimental spectrum [Fig. 6(a)] was facilitated by the appreciable difference in spin-spin relaxation times between chain and plane Cu sites, as known from NQR. The most narrow (20 kHz) and the broadest (\sim 500 kHz) lines in the **B_{0}\parallel c** spectrum belong to the double-chain site ^{68}Cu(4) and the single-chain site ^{68}Cu(1), respectively. The remaining 105 kHz broad line we assigned to a composition of two plane ^{65}Cu(2) and ^{68}Cu(3) lines with slightly different K_{cc} shifts 1.26% and 1.28%, respectively. Even at 11.7 T these two lines could not be resolved. Thus, K_{cc} is _practically equal_ for the two plane copper sites.

In the case of **B_{0}\perp c**, the plane Cu central lines of the more abundant ^{63}Cu isotope spectrum are far apart from the chain Cu lines, therefore preferentially this spectrum was used in the K_{aa} shift determination. As one can see in Fig. 6(b), the two ^{63}Cu(2) and ^{63}Cu(3) central lines are quite well resolved at room temperature. Unfortunately, with decreasing temperature due to the broadening and smaller frequency separation this resolution deteriorates. Taking into account the experimentally determined temperature variation of \nu_{Q}'s shown in Fig. 3 and by using the line shape model for **B_{0}\perp c** orientation, we were able to extract the temperature dependence of the total K_{aa} (=K_{bb}) shifts for Cu(2) and Cu(3). However, to obtain the more relevant temperature dependent spin part **K^{\rm spin}** one has to know the constant orbital part **K^{\rm orb}**, usually obtained as the rest **K** shift at temperatures far below T_{c}. In the case of Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}, as already mentioned, the broadening and the overlap of the two lines prevent an accurate enough determination of **K^{\rm orb}**. Therefore we had to resort on the values obtained by Barrett _et al._ for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Ref. [33]) and by Zimmermann _et al._ for YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}.[6] As one may expect both values agree in er

## 5 Discussion

In this section we first discuss the two major topics of our study, the doping of the CuO_{2} planes and the interplane coupling in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}, and, then, analyze our data in terms of two phenomenological models providing analytical expressions for relaxation and Knight shift which can be readily evaluated.

### Charge-carrier density in the CuO_{2} planes

The EFG tensor [Eq. (8)] and hence \nu_{Q} [Eq. (5)] of the plane copper sites is very sensitive to changes in the density of mobile holes, n, in the CuO_{2} planes. Indeed, the NQR experiments in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Refs. 35 and 36) and La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (Ref. 37) show that \nu_{Q} of the plane copper nuclei shifts towards higher values with increasing n. In the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} family, \nu_{Q} changes from 23.18 MHz in undoped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} (Ref. 38) to 31.53 MHz at 100 K in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.[29] Optimal doping maximizing T_{c} occurs for \delta=0.06.[39] In this sense, YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is overdoped and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} is underdoped. In the La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system, \nu_{Q} increases linearly with Sr doping from 33 MHz for x=0 to 36.2 MHz for x=0.15.

The structural differences between various Y-Ba-Cu-O family members occur only in the CuO chains, leaving the nearest neighborhood of the plane Cu practically unchanged. The effects of these structural changes can be seen best of all via the NQR frequency of the Ba nuclei, \nu_{Q}(Ba). Due to the closed electron shell of the Ba ion, \nu_{Q}(Ba) is exclusively determined by the _lattice_ contribution to the EFG and is as such very sensitive to structural changes. While \nu_{Q}(Ba) in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is still 6% higher than \nu_{Q}(Ba) in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8},[10] the \nu_{Q}(Ba) of these parent substances differ only by 2% from the \nu_{Q}(Ba) of the respective blocks in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}.[40] Therefore it is reasonable to assume that the changes of the EFG and thus \nu_{Q} of plane Cu in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}, and Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} arise predominantly from the changes of the EFG due to different in-plane dopings.

Based on these facts we can estimate n, the hole concentration per plane Cu atom, for the CuO_{2} planes in the 1-2-3 and 1-2-4 blocks, respectively. In analogy to the La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system, we assume that \nu_{Q} of the planar Cu in the Y-Ba-Cu-O compounds increases linearly with n, and use the \nu_{Q} values of Table 2 (for 100 K). This way we find that n of the Cu(2)O_{2} and Cu(3)O_{2} planes in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} is 79 and 98 %, respectively, of the hole concentration found in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, which means that the planes of the 1-2-3 block are more heavily doped than the planes of the 1-2-4 block. The doping levels do not change much with temperature since the variation of the corresponding \nu_{Q} values with temperature is small.

To be quantitative, we calibrate the \nu_{Q}-vs-n relation by assigning \nu_{Q} of Cu(2) in undoped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} to n=0 and by taking the formal 0.33 holes/Cu atom for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} as the n value corresponding to \nu_{Q}=31.53 MHz. We thus obtain d\nu_{Q}/dn=23.4 MHz/hole which compares well with the value 21 MHz/hole derived from La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} data.[37] The 23.4 MHz/hole value then yields hole concentrations of 0.325 and 0.262 for the planes in the 1-2-3 and 1-2-4 blocks of Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}, respectively, and a concentration of 0.259 for YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} planes. As suspected, the last two values are very close to the formal 0.25 holes/Cu atom in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}.

The finding of different hole concentrations in the 1-2-3 and 1-2-4 blocks is qualitatively supported by plane Cu spin-lattice relaxation rate, W, and Knight shift data. It is now widely agreed that the relaxation at plane Cu sites is primarily caused by antiferromagnetic (AF) electron spin fluctuations which, according to neutron scattering experiments, get progressively suppressed by growing charge carrier density.[41] Hence, the room temperature relaxation rate in Y-Ba-Cu-O monotonically decreases with increasing CuO_{2} plane doping.[42, 43, 44] Assuming that the same tendency holds for Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}, it follows from the Cu(2) and Cu(3) relaxation data that the 1-2-3 block has a higher doping level than the 1-2-4 block. Furthermore, at high temperature where the temperature dependence of W[Cu(2)] and W[Cu(3)] levels off, W[Cu(3)] agrees quite well with that of Cu(2) in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}, indicating an equal charge carrier density in corresponding planes. The agreement of the Cu(2) relaxation rates in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and in the 1-2-3 block is somewhat poorer. The slightly higher rate in the 1-2-3 block may be an indication of a somewhat lower doping level in this block.

In contrast to the relaxation rate, the Knight shift K^{\rm spin}_{aa} in (Y,Pr)Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7},[44] YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta},[45] and in TlBa_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} (Ref. 46) grows with increasing n. In Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} the 1-2-3 block exhibits a larger shift than the 1-2-4 block (Fig. 7), which again supports the con

The external field {\bf B}_{0} lies perpendicular to the crystal {\bf c} axis.

  clusion of a higher plane doping level in the 1-2-3 block as compared to the 1-2-4 block.

Summarizing the preceding findings, the multilattice compound Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} turns out to be a structure containing _planes of differing doping level_. The planes in the 1-2-4 block (1-2-3 block) are slightly higher (lower) doped than those in the corresponding parent compounds.

### Coupling of CuO_{2} planes above T_{c}

In Figs. 4 and 7 we compare the temperature dependences of the relaxation rate, W, and of the spin part of the magnetic shift, K_{aa}^{\rm spin}, measured in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} with corresponding values of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}. For both, W and K_{aa}^{\rm spin}, the respective values coincide above 300 K, whereas in the range between T_{c} and 300 K the Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} data show a temperature variation which appreciably differs from that observed for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} as well as YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} data. The relaxation rates together with the Knight shifts of each plane of the double plane exhibit a temperature dependence typical for an underdoped high-T_{c} superconductor. Furthermore, as evident from Fig. 8, in the normal conducting state at temperatures above 100 K, a constant relaxation rate ratio r_{W}=W[{\rm Cu}(3)]/W[{\rm Cu}(2)]=1.28(7) together with a constant shift ratio r_{K}=K_{aa}^{\rm spin}[{\rm Cu}(3)]/K_{aa}^{\rm spin}[{\rm Cu}(2)]=0.90(6) are observed.

According to Eq. (10) and Eq. (12), the temperature independent r_{K} and r_{W} imply a temperature independent relationship between the respective static and dynamic electronic spin susceptibilities. The relaxation rate, strictly speaking, involves the q averaged imaginary part of \chi(q,\omega_{0}). However, if we assume that the spin fluctuations at the corner of the Brillouin zone, q=Q_{AF}, dominate the relaxation, the sum over q can be replaced by \chi^{\prime\prime}(Q_{AF}). The plane copper hyperfine constants appearing in the ratios are alike in Y-Ba-Cu-O compounds [47, 48] and seem to be temperature independent. In other words, both the static and the dynamic electron susceptibilities of the two single planes of each double plane are governed by the _same_ temperature dependence which means common spin dynamics in both planes, and hence these planes must be strongly coupled. However, since r_{K} and r_{W} are not equal, the q dependence of the susceptibility is not the same in the two planes.

A strong interplane coupling was recently observed by neutron scattering in the insulating antiferromagnetic YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} (Ref. [18]) and in superconducting YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6} (Ref. [19]) and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}[20]. In YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}, the large interplane exchange coupling (with coupling constant of about 15 meV) orders the next-nearest CuO_{2} planes antiferromagnetically below the Neel temperature, T_{N}. In YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6} and in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} a similar interplane coupling produces strong AF electron spin-spin correlations which persist from the normal into the superconducting state. Note, however, that the coupled planes in these compounds are _equivalent_ in contrast to those in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}.

At the moment the mechanism of interplane coupling in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} is not known. Direct and indirect exchange interactions are possible candidates. Because of the relatively large interplane distance of 3.2 A a direct exchange between the small Cu 3d_{3z^{\prime}\to z^{\prime}} orbitals seems to be less likely and probably an indirect superexchange via oxygen and yttrium must be invoked. The coupling _strength_ may be estimated from the K_{aa}^{\rm spin}-vs-temperature plot (Fig. 7). Below 300 K, the K_{aa}^{\rm spin} shifts in the 1-2-3 and 1-2-4 blocks begin to depart from those in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} due to the interplane coupling, thus the coupling strength is not much less than k_{B}\times 300 K or 30 meV.

The strong AF interplane correlations observed in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6} and in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} by neutron experiments are presumably present also in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}. Then, as pointed out by Tranquada _et al._, [19] the correlations impose restrictions on the charge-carrier movement which has to be of a special kind, most probably coherent in both planes to retain the interplane spin-spin correlations.

Irrespective of its nature, the question remains whether the interplane coupling favors or impedes superconductivity. Several theories of high-T_{c} superconductivity incorporate the interplane coupling as an essential ingredient. In the theory of Anderson, [49] only the interplane pair tunneling between coupled planes makes superconductivity possible. Altshuler and Ioffe [50] stress the importance of interplane correlations, arguing that they are essential for the system to become superconducting. The possibility of (nodeless) d-wave superconductivity in a double-plane model is predicted by Bulut _et al._[51] and by Dagotto _et al._[52] Morgenstern _et al._[53] find evidence of d-wave superconductivity in their Monte Carlo simulations of the double-plane Hubbard model.

To our knowledge, none of the theories taking into account interplane coupling find it unfavorable for superconductivity. On the other hand, Eenige _et al._[54] claim that the occurrence of superconductivity in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} is due to the proximity effect rather than to an interplane coupling. Their argument is based on a

  kink seen in the pressure dependence of T_{c}. In order to explain a T_{c} being higher than in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} and even YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, the authors, however, are forced to postulate an extra doping via interstitial oxygen.

Our experiments, however, clearly demonstrate the presence of an interplane coupling in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}. Obviously, we cannot tell whether this coupling favors or impedes superconductivity. Nevertheless, our result fits into the framework of several theories favoring interplane coupling (see, for instance, Ref. [55]).

A final comment concerns the high value of T_{c}. As pointed out in the preceding section, the 1-2-3 block in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} is close to or even at optimal doping for the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} structure. Thus it is tempting to assume that the "best plane," namely that of the 1-2-3 block, determines T_{c}. However, this argument fails for a composition of Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} which yields a T_{c} of 95 K since, to our knowledge, the T_{c} values of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} do not exceed 93 K. Thus, it is conceivable that the interplane coupling plays a role in obtaining high-T_{c} values. NMR-NQR experiments on Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} samples with T_{c}=95 K may perhaps provide answers to this issue.

### Interplane coupling below T_{c}

Next we will discuss briefly the relevance of the temperature dependence of W and K_{aa}^{\rm spin} close and below T_{c}. Just above T_{c}, r_{W} begins to diminish with decreasing temperature. After smoothly passing into the superconducting state it decreases to a minimum of 1.0 at 80 K, where it starts to increase again. In contrast, r_{K} remains constant down to T_{c}, where it starts to increase. Unfortunately, the overlap of Cu(2) and Cu(3) lines prevents measurements of r_{K} below 76 K. Both ratios have the same value, namely 1.0, around 80 K which is close to T_{c} of YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}. Whether this is purely accidental remains an open question.

The variation of r_{W} and r_{K} with temperature in the superconducting state means that the susceptibilities of the individual planes of the double plane have lost their common temperature dependence. It is tempting to assume a weakening or even loss of the interplane coupling as the underlying cause. This, however, would contradict the results of neutron scattering experiments in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6} (Ref. [19]) and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7},[20] where no significant change of the interplane correlation at and below T_{c} is observed. There is also evidence for strong coupling between the superconducting CuO_{2} planes in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} from single-crystal transport measurements.[56]

Another reason why the common temperature dependence disappears could be a formation of two superconducting gaps that differ in the individual planes because of their different charge-carrier densities, n. However, up to now even the spatial symmetry of the superconducting state in Y-Ba-Cu-O and so the form of the superconducting gap is not well established, let alone its dependence on n. Thus, the explanation of the temperature variation of r_{W} and r_{K} below T_{c} is still missing.

### Relaxation and Knight shift mechanisms

The crucial point in deriving the spin-lattice relaxation rate [Eq. (12)] and the Knight shift [Eq. (10)] is the calculation of the susceptibility, \chi(q,\omega_{0}). In the absence of a complete understanding of the electronic state of Y-Ba-Cu-O superconductors, approximations must be introduced.

In the phenomenological model of Millis, Monien, and Pines (MMP),[57, 3]\chi(q,\omega_{0}) is treated in a mean-field approximation and it is decomposed into a quasiparticle (normal Fermi-liquid-like) contribution and a contribution arising from AF correlations. The MMP model gives a quantitative account of relaxation data at Cu, O, and Y sites in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Ref. [57]) and at Cu(2) sites in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} (Ref. [10]) provided the square of the correlation length of the AF fluctuations, \xi^{2}, has approximately a Curie-Weiss-like temperature dependence. Since neutron scattering investigations[18] concluded that \xi is temperature independent the applicability of the MMP model has been questioned.

A different approach to explain the anomalous temperature dependence of the relaxation rate has been suggested by Millis and Monien.[58] From their analysis of relaxation data, they concluded that the spectral weight in the spin fluctuations decreases as the temperature is lowered. This missing spectral weight must reappear at a higher energy in the form of a transition over a "spin pseudogap," \Delta. Thus, there are two competing effects which determine the variation of T_{1} with temperature: the increase of AF fluctuations with falling temperature and the spin-gap effect. At a certain temperature the spin-gap effect wins and (T_{1}T)^{-1} starts to decrease. The widespread nature of the spin-gap effect has been noted by Rice.[59]

After the discovery of the spin-gap effect in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} by neutron scattering[60] several NMR groups have regarded the spin-gap effect to be responsible for the peculiar temperature variation of the relaxation rate, at least in the normal conducting state.[3] The relaxation rate is described by an _ad hoc_ formula:

\[\frac{1}{T_{1}T}=\left(\frac{A_{0}}{T}\right)^{\alpha}\left[1-\tanh^{2}\left( \frac{\Delta_{\rm AF}}{2T}\right)\right].\] (13)

Here, \Delta_{\rm AF} denotes the spin-gap energy at the Q_{\rm AF}=(\frac{\pi}{a},\frac{\pi}{a}) since the Cu relaxation is dominated by the strong AF fluctuations around Q_{\rm AF}.[57]A_{0} is a constant and the factor T^{-\alpha} guarantees a reasonable description for the high-temperature behavior and may be attributed to the gradual decay of AF correlations at higher temperatures.[57] Some applications of Eq. (13) to both Knight shift and relaxation rates are discussed in Refs. [61] and [62].

Figure 9 shows the fit of Eq. (13) to the Cu(2) and Cu(3) relaxation rates in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15}. The parameters for both fits are \Delta_{\rm AF}=240(20) K and \alpha=1.25 which within the error limits agree with \Delta_{\rm AF}=260(10) K and \alpha=1.25 we obtained for YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} using our previous Cu(2) data.[6] This result again demonstrates the dominating role played by the double-chain block

 in Y2Ba4Cu7O15. A similar relaxation rate behavior of plane copper is observed for the bulk oxygen deficient YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (_d_ >0.06) material.[42]

The spin shift data are fitted by a similar _ad hoc_ expression:

\[K_{aa}^{\rm spin}(T)=K_{0}^{\rm spin}\left[1-\tanh^{2}\left(\frac{\Delta_{0}}{ 2T}\right)\right],\] (14)

where D0 is the spin-gap energy at q = (0,0). Equation (14) describes quite well K_{aa}^{\rm spin}(T) in the normal conducting state. For Y2Ba4Cu7O15, the fit yields for both blocks a common D0 = 150(20) K and two separate prefactors: K_{0}^{\rm spin}=0.290\% for the 1-2-3 and K_{0}^{\rm spin}=0.260\% for the 1-2-4 block. The same fit procedure applied to YBa2Cu4O8 data yields D0 = 210(20) K and K_{0}^{\rm spin}=0.267\%. Provided the temperature variation of the Knight shift arises from a spin-gap opening and Eq. (14) represents an appropriate description of this effect, then the results imply, first, that a spin gap, D0, opens at q = (0,0) and, second, that D0 is smaller than D_AF.

We conclude this section by mentioning a completely different approach[63] to interpret the plane Cu relaxation rate. The high-_T_c superconducting compound is viewed as a dilute system of neutral holes in an antiferromagnet that tends to separate into hole-rich and hole-poor phases, but is frustrated by long-range Coulomb interactions. As a consequence, large-amplitude local hole density fluctuations occur and their interaction with the mobile holes determines the normal conducting state properties. By approximating the fluctuations with a single-mode spin-1 excitation of wave vector _Q_AF and energy _ph__g_, Emery and Kivelson[63] deduced for the relaxation rate the following expression:

\[\frac{1}{T_{1}T}=\frac{C_{0}}{T}\left[4+\exp\left(\frac{\omega_{g}}{kT}\right) +3\exp\left(-\frac{\omega_{g}}{kT}\right)\right]^{-1}\ ,\] (15)

where C0 is a constant. As seen in Fig. 9, this formula allows quite a good fit to the plane Cu relaxation data, delivering _ph__g_ = 250(10) K for Y2Ba4Cu7O15 and 270(10) K for YBa2Cu4O8.

We like to stress that we have restricted our discussion of relaxation and Knight shift data to the previous two models only simply for the fact that Eqs. (13)-(15) contain parameters easely obtained by fitting the data. However, it is obvious that one cannot discriminate between these two models on the basis of our NMR experiments only.

## VI Summary

We have reported the first observation of Cu NQR-NMR in Y2Ba4Cu7O15. In zero magnetic field we have measured the temperature dependence of the copper NQR frequency and spin-lattice relaxation at all four chemically inequivalent copper sites. In a 9.03 T magnetic field applied parallel and perpendicular to the **c** axis of an oriented powder sample, we have determined the temperature dependence of the copper magnetic shift at the two inequivalent plane copper sites.

The Y2Ba4Cu7O15 compound turns out to be a structure containing two inequivalent CuO2 planes of differing doping levels. Thus, Y2Ba4Cu7O15 is the first double-plane cuprate where the interplane coupling could be accessed by Cu NMR-NQR studies.

In the normal conducting state, both the static and the dynamic electron spin susceptibilities of the individual planes of a double plane are governed by the _same_ temperature dependence. This means a common spin dynamics in both planes, and hence these planes must be strongly coupled. The estimated lower limit of the corresponding interplane coupling is not much less than 30 meV. Although the planes are strongly coupled, their spin susceptibilities retain a distinct q dependence. The temperature dependence itself is typical for an underdoped high-_T_c compound.

Below _T_c, the common temperature dependence is lost, which could arise from the opening of two superconducting gaps that differ in the individual planes, thus manifesting the different plane charge carrier densities of the 1-2-4 and 1-2-3 blocks.

Two models were used to fit the experimental data in the normal conducting phase. The temperature variation of both the relaxation rate and the Knight shift at planar sites can be described as the effect of the opening of a spin gap yielding spin-gap values of 240 K and 150 K at wave vectors _Q_AF = (\frac{\pi}{a}, \frac{\pi}{a}) and q = (0,0), respectively. The corresponding values for YBa2Cu4O8 are \Delta_{\rm AF} = 260 K and \Delta_{0} = 210 K.

Applying the "frustrated phase separation" model due to Emery and Kivelson to the planar Cu relaxation in

Figure 9: The fits of Eq. (13) (dashed lines) and of Eq. (15) (dotted lines) to the measured Cu(2) (open circles) and Cu(3) (filled circles) relaxation rates in Y2Ba4Cu7O15. The parameters (for both sites) are Δ_AF = 240 K and \alpha = 1.25 for Eq. (13) and _ω__g_ = 250 K for Eq. (15).

  Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{7}O_{15} yields 250 K for the large-amplitude low-energy \omega_{g} fluctuations of the local hole density. Since both models allow fits that remain well in the limits of the experimental error bars, a discrimination of these models on the basis of presently available experimental data is not possible.
