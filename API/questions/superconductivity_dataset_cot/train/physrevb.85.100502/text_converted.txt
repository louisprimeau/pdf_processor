###### Abstract

The upper critical fields _H_c2(_T_) of single crystals of the
superconductor Ca10(Pt4-_z_As8)(Fe(6.95Pt0.08))As2s)s (δ ≈ 0.246) are
determined over a wide range of temperatures down to T = 1.42 K and
magnetic fields of up to m0_H_ >= 92 T. The measurements of anisotropic
_H_c2(_T_) curves are performed in pulsed magnetic fields using
radio-frequency contactless penetration depth measurements for magnetic
field applied both parallel and perpendicular to the **ab** plane.
Whereas a clear upward curvature in H_(c2)^(1sk)(T) along **H** | **c**
is observed with decreasing temperature, the H_(c2)^(1sk)(T) along **H**
| **ab** shows a flattening at low temperatures. The rapid increase of
the H_(c2)^(1sk)(T) at low temperatures suggests that the
superconductivity can be described by two dominating bands. The
anisotropy parameter g_(m) = _H_c2(_T_)/_H_c2 is  7 close to _T_c and
decreases considerably to  1 with decreasing temperature, showing rather
weak anisotropy at low temperatures.

typically ∼0.2 × 0.2 × 0.05 mm³. Note that in order to reduce open-loop
area of samples for H ∥ c, a smaller size sample (∼0.12 × 0.12 × 0.05
mm³) was used for measurements up to 92 T in the multishot magnet. No
significant difference between 60 and 92 T measurements was detected.

In zero field, the superconducting transition temperature, determined
from the (dΔF)/dT analysis, gives T_(c) = 26.5 K for three samples, used
in the both short-pulse 60 T and multishot 95 T magnet [inset in Fig.
2(a)]; as the temperature decreases, ΔF sharply increases at T_(c). The
evolution of superconductivity with magnetic field is shown in Fig. 2(a)
for H ∥ ab and Fig. 2(b) for H ∥ c. At this point, it should be noted
that the phase transitions determined by the rf technique are consistent
with offset criteria of resistance measurements shown in Ref. [17]. In
comparison with the samples reported in Ref. [7], samples studied in
this work show a slightly higher T_(c), related to the different Pt
doping concentration in the Fe₂As₂ layer.

Using the deviation from the normal-state criterion, discussed in Ref.
[17], the H_(c2)(T) curve is inferred from the ΔF versus H plots shown
in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b); the determined H_(c2) is indicated by arrows.
Note that the H_(c2) error bar is estimated by the difference between
the H_(c2) values determined by the point deviating from the background
and by taking the slope of the rf signal intercepting the slope of the
normal-state background.[17] In addition, the hysteresis detected in 92
T multishot measurements (see Fig. 1) is considered to determine the
error bar. The obtained H_(c2)(T) curves for both H ∥ ab and H ∥ c are
plotted in Fig. 3, as determined from the H < 60 T in a short pulse
(squares) and from the H < 92 T in a multishot (circles) taken from the
down-sweep of the magnetic field. The star symbols in Fig. 3 are
extracted by linear extrapolation of ΔF curves at H < 60 T and H < 92 T,
as shown by dashed lines in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). As a representative
curve, ΔF taken at 4 K in a 60-T short-pulse magnet is presented in the
inset of Fig. 2(b), where the critical field determined by extrapolating
ΔF curve is consistent with the one determined by down-sweep of the 92 T
magnetic field. The shapes of the H_(c2)(T) curves for H ∥ ab and H ∥ c
in Fig. 3 clearly show the different temperature dependence. A
conventional linear field dependence of H_(c2) is observed close to the
T_(c), with clearly different slopes for the two field orientations. In
the low-field

Figure 2: (Color online) (a) ΔF as a function of magnetic field for
H ∥ ab at selected temperatures. Solid lines are 60 T short-pulse
measurements and symbols (triangle and square) are 92 T multishot
measurements. Open circles are ΔF taken at 28 K as a normal-state
background signal. The determined H_(c2) is indicated by arrows. The
dashed lines represent the linear extrapolation of ΔF to the normal
state. The horizontal dashed-dotted line is a guide to the eye. The
inset shows the temperature dependence of ΔF at H = 0 for three samples.
(b) ΔF as a function of magnetic field for H ∥ c at selected
temperatures. Due to the small size of the sample used, the ΔF measured
in the multishot magnet is small compared to the 60 T curve. Inset shows
ΔF curves at T = 4 K from both magnet systems. The arrow indicates the
H_(c2) determined by the 92 T measurement.

magnetic field for H ∥ ab and H ∥ c at T = 3.87 K. Right axis: The
waveform of pulse for the 92 T. The fast sweep rate of magnetic fields
up to 92 T (within 15 ms, see inset) is provided by a capacitor bank on
the peak of the slowly sweeping ∼36 T magnetic field (∼2.5 s) derived by
a motor generator. Because of the radical change of magnetic field at
∼36 T, ΔF curves show a slope break, as indicated by the vertical dashed
line.

region, the H_(c2) curves are consistent with earlier resistance
study.[7] Toward higher fields, $H_{c2}^{\parallel\rm ab}$ presents a
tendency to saturate, whereas the curve for $H_{c2}^{\parallel\rm c}$
shows a steep increase.

The anisotropy coefficient γ_(H) is plotted in the inset of Fig. 3. One
can see that the value of γ_(H) is ∼7 near T_(c) and then decreases
considerably to ∼1 with decreasing temperature. This temperature
dependence of γ_(H) is similar to other Fe-based superconductors. Close
to T_(c), the γ_(H) of the 10-4-8 phase is bigger than that of the 122
type[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31,
32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49,
50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 6 of
superconductivity at low temperatures. For H ∥ ab, H_(c2)(T) can be
described by taking into account Pauli paramagnetism, whereas for H ∥ c,
H_(c2)(T) exhibits a steep increase at low temperatures, quite possibly
due to the multiband effect.
