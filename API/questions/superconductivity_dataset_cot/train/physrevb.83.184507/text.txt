###### Abstract

Metal transition and superconductivity were observed in Li-doped _a_-rhombohedral boron (_a_-B\({}_{12}\)). The authors have established a purification method and obtained a large amount of high-purity _a_-B\({}_{12}\) powder. Li doping into purified _a_-B\({}_{12}\) was attempted by vapor diffusion processing (VDP) in a Mo or Ta tube. Li-doped _a_-B\({}_{12}\) contained metallic glittering particles. Meissner effects were observed in such a compound with the nominal composition Li,B\({}_{12}\) (_x_ = 1.0, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7, or 2.5) (_T\({}_{\rm c}\)_ = 3.2-7 K). As for Li2,B\({}_{12}\), the temperature dependence of its electrical conductivity indicates a metallic character and its electrical resistivity drop is detected near the Meissner temperature. The existence of Li and Fermi edges in Li-doped _a_-B\({}_{12}\) crystals was verified by transmission electron microscopy-electron energy loss spectroscopy (TEM-EELS). Lattice expansion, which is a well-known indicator of metal doping into a crystal, was also observed. Thus, Li doping into _a_-B\({}_{12}\) was successfully achieved. Our work also suggests that it is possible to dope a larger amount of Li into _a_-B\({}_{12}\) and to increase its _T\({}_{\rm c}\)_.

## I Introduction

B-rich solids including elemental boron (B), such as _a_- and _b_-rhombohedral (_a_-B\({}_{12}\) and _b_-B\({}_{105}\), respectively), _a_-tetragonal (_a_-B\({}_{50}\)), and _g_-orthorhombic (_g_-B\({}_{28}\)) B's, have a framework crystalline structure built up from B\({}_{12}\) icosahedra.[1, 2, 3, 4] They are called boron-icosahedral cluster solids (B-ICSs). One of the remarkable characteristics of B-ICSs is the high degeneracy of their electronic states due to the high symmetry of icosahedra. Such degeneracy brings a relatively high density of states (DOS) and if one can adjust the Fermi energy (_E\({}_{\rm F}\)_) to this high-DOS position, B-ICSs could be a high-_T\({}_{\rm c}\)_ superconductor.[5, 6, 7, 8] Another remarkable character of B-ICSs is their comparatively large interstitial cites, therefore, there are some attempts to dope other elements into B-ICSs, aiming at the adjustment of _E\({}_{\rm F}\)_.[9, 10, 11, 12]

In spite of many experimental efforts,[9, 10, 11, 12] there is still no reliable report on superconductivity or metal transition in metal-doped B-ICSs. We reported the possibility of superconductivity in Li-doped _a_-B\({}_{12}\) in our previous paper.[10] However, because its volume fraction was only 0.02% and x-ray analysis could not reveal evidence of Li doping, it is doubtful whether superconductivity originated from Li-doped _a_-B\({}_{12}\). There are two problems in the previous experiments. The first problem is that the crystallized _a_-B\({}_{12}\) powder included impurity phases, that is, B\({}_{6}\)O, _b_-B\({}_{105}\), and amorphous boron (am-B), and these impurity phases covered the surface of _a_-B\({}_{12}\) particles and obstructed effective Li doping [Fig. 1(a)]. The second problem is that Li reacted not only with _a_-B\({}_{12}\) but also with the quartz tube used for the sealing.

In this study we solved these problems by removing impurity phases by chemical treatment and by improving doping processes using a Ta or Mo tube, and report on the discovery of a superconductor in the Li-doped _a_-B\({}_{12}\) system.

## II Experimental

Raw _a_-B\({}_{12}\) powder for refining was prepared by annealing 4N purity am-B at 1200 degC for 50 h.[10, 13] X-ray diffraction analysis with Cu_K_a_ radiation showed that _a_-B\({}_{12}\) is the main phase of the annealed am-B powder but that some impurity phases (i.e., _b_-B\({}_{105}\), B\({}_{6}\)O, and am-B phases) are contained [as shown in Fig. 2(a)]. B\({}_{6}\)O was generated from oxides (mainly B\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)) originally included in the 4N purity am-B. _b_-B\({}_{105}\) and am-B were generated and remained, respectively, because of the narrow crystallization temperature range of _a_-B\({}_{12}\).[10, 13] Figure 1(a) shows a SEM image of the annealed am-B powder. Crystallized _a_-B\({}_{12}\) particles are covered with impurity phases, which should interrupt effective Li doping. To dope Li effectively, we dissolved the impurity phases _b_-B and am-B on these crystallized _a_-B\({}_{12}\) particles by ultrasonic vibration in nitric acid for 100 min. After neutralization and centrifugation, _b_-B and am-B were completely removed, but B\({}_{6}\)O remained. A liquid mixture was prepared by adding 5 ml of pure water, 20 ml of ethanol and 20 ml of glycerol to 0.1 g of nitric acid-processed _a_-B\({}_{12}\) powder. The liquid mixture was then ultrasonically vibrated and centrifuged for 5 min at 3700 G. As a result, the liquid phase was separated into three layers and B\({}_{6}\)O was easily removed. Figure 1(b) shows a FE-SEM image of the purified _a_-B\({}_{12}\) powder. No impurity is observed on the surface of _a_-B\({}_{12}\). This means that effective Li doping is attainable. Figure 2(b) shows the XRD patterns of the purified _a_-B\({}_{12}\) powder. No impurity phase was observed. Therefore we successfully obtained high-purity _a_-B\({}_{12}\) powder. The productivity of this refining process is approximately 20%. Some of the purified _a_-B\({}_{12}\) powder was used to form cylindrical pellets by spark plasma sintering (SPS) for the evaluation of electrical conductivity.

The Li doping of the purified powder and pellets was attempted by a vapor diffusion process (VDP), which is a similar method used in the previous studies [9, 10, 11, 12]. Li doping was improved using a Mo or Ta tube, which hardly reacts with Li, instead of a quartz tube. Purified \(\alpha\)-B\({}_{12}\) powder and pellets were placed in a hexagonal boron nitride crucible and sealed in a Mo or Ta tube with Li by arc welding then annealed at several temperatures between 1173 and 1673 K for 0.2-100 h.

## III Results and discussion

Some of the Li-doped samples contained metallic glittering particles. Meissner effects were observed in the samples with nominal composition Li\({}_{x}\)B\({}_{12}\) (\(x\) = 1.0, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7, or 2.5) (\(T_{c}\) = 3.2\(\sim\)7 K), as shown in Fig. 3 for a typical example and as summarized in Table 1. The volume fractions estimated from ZFC curves were scattered from 0.63% to 13.82%.

The differences in \(T_{c}\) may be accounted for by the different site occupancies of the dopant Li. Theoretical studies have revealed that the effect of Li doping is nearly rigid-band-model-like [5, 7, 8]. Therefore one of the parameter of \(T_{c}\), the DOS at the Fermi energy [\(N(E_{\rm F})\)], varies in proportional to the amount of doped Li and \(T_{c}\) may change. The site occupancies of the Li will be discussed later. Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity (\(\sigma\)) of Li-doped \(\alpha\)-B\({}_{12}\). \(\sigma\) increases with increasing nominal composition of Li. Li\({}_{2.5}\)B\({}_{12}\) shows metallic electrical conductivity and an electrical resistivity drop near the Meissner temperature (\(T_{c}\) = 6.62 K), as shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. The reason for imperfect resistivity drop is possibly the nonuniformity of the doping into the interstitial sites of \(\alpha\)-B\({}_{12}\).

The secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) of Li-doped \(\alpha\)-B\({}_{12}\) pellets revealed that there are only small differences between their nominal and analyzed compositions. Therefore it is guaranteed that stocked Li was completely diffused on average in each pellet by VDP. Transmission electron microscopy-electron energy loss spectroscopy (TEM-EELS) detected Li and the Fermi edges in some Li-doped \(\alpha\)-B\({}_{12}\) fine particles (Li\({}_{2.5}\)B\({}_{12}\)-2 in Fig. 6). Although, in most of the other particles, a chemical shift of the 1\(s\) electron-excitation

  spectra, which corresponds to the DOS of the conduction bands, was observed, no Fermi edge was observed (Li2.5B12-1 in Fig. 6). This means that most of the minute Li-doped \(\alpha\)-B12 crystals were electron doped; however, the number of the doped carriers was not sufficient for the metal transition. Therefore, a well-Li-doped superconducting (SC) phase and some Li-doped semiconducting phases were formed, resulting in small volume fractions of the SC phase.

The site occupancies and lattice constants were calculated using the powder XRD patterns obtained at the SPring-8 synchrotron radiation facility. Program RIETAN2000 was used for the Rietveld refinement.[14] Figure 7 shows the results of the Rietveld analysis of the XRD data for Li1.40B12 (\(T_{c}\) = 3.2 and 3.8 K) doped with Li in a Ta tube. No possible compound (Ta, TaB, or TaB2) with a similar \(T_{c}\) was observed in the XRD patterns. Table 2 shows the result of the Rietveld refinement and Table 3 shows a comparison of the site occupancies and lattice constants obtained with previous experimental values of pristine \(\alpha\)-B12 and theoretical values. The experimental composition of the Li1.40B12 calculated by Rietveld refinement is Li0.30B12, which is found different

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Li1.4B12} \\ \hline  & \(R_{\rm{wp}}\) = 2.86\% & & \(R_{I}\) = 4.82\% \\ \hline Lattice constant & \(a\) = 4.9457(1) & \(c\) = 12.6420(1) \\ \hline Site & \(g\) & \(x\) & \(y\) & \(z\) \\ Bl (p) & 1 & 0.7848(2) & l-x & 0.2242(1) \\ B2 (e) & 1 & 0.862  from the composition of Li\({}_{1.26}\)B\({}_{12}\) determined by SIMS. This disagreement in composition means that diffused Li was not completely doped into and ionized in the \(\alpha\)-B\({}_{12}\) crystals. The bulk density of the \(\alpha\)-B\({}_{12}\) pellets sintered by SPS is nearly 70%; therefore, most of the diffused Li would localize in pores and would not contribute to carrier doping. In other words, Rietveld analysis detected only doped Li in the doping sites but SIMS measurement detected all Li including oxides in the pore of pellets. Some Li exists on the surface of pores in the sample. Li doping is not uniform, and highly electron-doped regions (SC) and not sufficiently doped regions (semiconductor) are mixed. Hence, the path of the superconducting current was not completely connected and residual resistance remained (as shown in Fig. 5).

Small residuals in Fig. 7, which indicated a highly Li-doped \(\alpha\)-B\({}_{12}\) phase (SC), were observed on the smaller-\(\theta\) side of the Li\({}_{1.4}\)B\({}_{12}\) (Li\({}_{0.30}\)B\({}_{12}\)) XRD peaks. This doping inequality is consistent with the TEM-EELS analysis. A clear lattice expansion was observed in Li\({}_{1.4}\)B\({}_{12}\) (Li\({}_{0.30}\)B\({}_{12}\)), but the expansion ratios were smaller than the theoretical values [\(a\) = 0.75% (theory: 0.47%), \(c\) = 0.56% (theory: 2.76%)] as shown in TABLE II. This was caused by the low O-site occupancy for Li\({}_{1.4}\)B\({}_{12}\) (Li\({}_{0.3}\)B\({}_{12}\)). This low occupancy means that more space for Li is remaining. The effect of Li doping is considered to be nearly the same as that in the rigid-band model. Therefore, there is a possibility of obtaining higher \(T_{\rm c}\) by doping a larger amount of Li into \(\alpha\)-B\({}_{12}\) using a catalyst or a high-pressure technique.[15]

Table IV shows comparisons of rhombohedral lattice angle, lattice constants, intracluster B-B bonding, and intercluster B-B bonding between pristine \(\alpha\)-B\({}_{12}\)[16] and Li\({}_{1.4}\)B\({}_{12}\) (Li\({}_{0.3}\)B\({}_{12}\)) in this work. C sites are the center of B\({}_{12}\) icosahedra (0, 0, 0). The B atoms that have an intercluster two-center bond are called "p" which means polar. In contrast, the B atoms that have intercluster three-center bond are called "e", which means equatorial. These p and e sites are equal to B1 (p) and B2 (e) in Table II, respectively. In Table IV the comparisons between pristine \(\alpha\)-B\({}_{12}\) in the previous work and Li\({}_{1.4}\)B\({}_{12}\) (Li\({}_{0.3}\)B\({}_{12}\)) in this work confirmed that the rhombohedral lattice angle \(\alpha\) and intracluster bonding distance and angle hardly changed even after Li doping (insertion). In contrast to intracluster bonding distances, the intercluster p-p bonding distance was increased by Li insertion.

## IV Conclusions

In this study we report the superconducting transition of Li-doped \(\alpha\)-B\({}_{12}\) crystals for the first time, which was realized by the purification method that removes impurity phases in the \(\alpha\)-B\({}_{12}\) crystallized from amorphous boron. Meissner effects were observed with nominal compositions of Li\({}_{x}\)B\({}_{12}\) (\(x\) = 1.0, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7, 2.5) (\(T_{c}\) = 3.2\(\sim\)7 K). The temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity of \(\alpha\)-B\({}_{12}\) is improved in proportion to the amount of doped Li. TEM-EELS measurement detected Li and Fermi edges in Li-doped \(\alpha\)-B\({}_{12}\) fine particles, but doping inequality was also observed. Lattice expansion and Li were observed by the Rietveld analysis of the XRD patterns of Li-doped \(\alpha\)-B\({}_{12}\) at SPring-8. Therefore, Li doping into \(\alpha\)-B\({}_{12}\) was successfully achieved for the first time. The depth profiles of Li by SIMS revealed that almost all the stacked Li diffused into the pellets, but a large amount of Li must have localized in pores and does not contribute to the carrier doping. Our work

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c}  & B\({}_{12}\)[16] & Li\({}_{1.4}\)B\({}_{12}\) (Li\({}_{0.3}\)B\({}_{12}\)) \\ Angle (deg) & & & \\ \(\alpha_{\rm Rhomb}\) & 58.05 & 58.13(0.14\%) \\ p-C-p & 61.59 & 61.67(0.13\%) \\ p-C-e & 64.04 & 63.90(\(-\)0.22\%) \\ e-C-e & 63.25 & 63.06(\(-\)0.30\%) \\ Distance (Å) & & & \\ \(\alpha_{\rm Rhomb}\) & 5.059 & 5.090(0.62\%) \\ C-p & 1.713 & 1.713(0.01\%) \\ C-e & 1.702 & 1  also demonstrates that it is possible to dope a larger amount of Li into \(\alpha\)-B\({}_{12}\) and increase its \(T_{c}\).
