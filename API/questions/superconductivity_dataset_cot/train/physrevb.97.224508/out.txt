###### Abstract

Muon spin rotation and relaxation studies have been performed on a "111" family of iron-based superconductors, NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As, using single crystalline samples with Ni concentrations x=0, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 1.3, and 1.5%. Static magnetic order was characterized by obtaining the temperature and doping dependences of the local ordered magnetic moment size and the volume fraction of the magnetically ordered regions. For x=0 and 0.4%, a transition to a nearly-homogeneous long range magnetically ordered state is observed, while for x\gtrsim 0.4% magnetic order becomes more disordered and is completely suppressed for x=1.5%. The magnetic volume fraction continuously decreases with increasing x. Development of superconductivity in the full volume is inferred from Meissner shielding results for x\gtrsim 0.4%. The combination of magnetic and superconducting volumes implies that a spatially-overlapping coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity spans a large region of the T-x phase diagram for NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. As a strong reduction of both the ordered moment size and the volume fraction is observed below the superconducting T_{\rm C} for x=0.6, 1.0, and 1.3%, in contrast to other iron pnictides in which one of these two parameters exhibits a reduction below T_{\rm C}, but not both. The suppression of magnetic order is further enhanced with increased Ni doping, leading to a reentrant nonmagnetic state below T_{\rm C} for x=1.3%. The reentrant behavior indicates an interplay between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity involving competition for the same electrons. These observations are consistent with the sign-changing s^{\pm} superconducting state, which is expected to appear on the verge of microscopic coexistence and phase separation with magnetism. We also present a universal linear relationship between the local ordered moment size and the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature T_{\rm N} across a variety of iron-based superconductors. We argue that this linear relationship is consistent with an itinerant-electron approach, in which Fermi surface nesting drives antiferromagnetic ordering. In studies of superconducting properties, we find that the T=0 limit of superfluid density follows the linear trend observed in underdoped cuprates when plotted against T_{\rm C}. This paper also includes a detailed theoretical prediction of the muon stopping sites and provides comparisons with experimental results.

## I Introduction

Iron-based high temperature superconductors (Fe-HTS) are materials exhibiting unconventional superconductivity that arise from parent compounds with static antiferromagnetic (AFM) order [1, 2, 3]. One of the grand challenges in understanding the behavior of these systems is determining the physical mechanism responsible for superconductivity. Essential information on the nature of superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems can be deduced by investigating their phase diagrams as well as the superconducting (SC) gap structure.

In the parent compound of many Fe-HTS, a spin density wave forms with spins ordered antiparallel to each other along one Fe-Fe axis and parallel to each other along the orthog  onal Fe-Fe bond direction [1,2,4]. Carrier doping, isovalent chemical substitution, or application of pressure to the parent system suppresses magnetic order and begets a SC dome [5]. In addition to magnetism and superconductivity, Fe-HTS exhibit a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural distortion at a temperature T_{\text{S}} that precedes or occurs concurrently with the magnetic phase transition at temperature T_{\text{N}}[1,3,4,6,7]. The prominent in-plane anisotropy in resistivity along orthogonal axes in the paramagnetic (PM) orthorhombic state is associated with an electronic nematic order parameter that triggers the orthorhombic distortion of the crystal [8,9]. The aforementioned orders are found in close proximity with each other. AFM and SC orders homogeneously coexist in several Fe-HTS, such as in BaFe_{2-x}Co_{x}As_{2}[10,11], BaFe_{2-x}Ni_{x}As_{2}[12], Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}[13], and NaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}As [14]. In these systems, the ordered magnetic moment size and nematic order parameter smoothly decrease as the temperature is lowered below T_{\text{C}}, corroborating the fact that superconductivity and magnetic long range order compete for the same electrons [15]. However, other studies [16,17] have detected the mutual exclusion of these two order parameters, i.e., they exhibit macroscopic phase separation in different parts of the sample. Characterizing common features of the complex interplay among magnetic, nematic, and SC orders in various Fe-HTS is essential for elucidating the microscopic pairing mechanism in Fe-HTS and other unconventional superconductors.

One of the major experimental challenges in teasing apart AFM and SC orders is that individual experimental probes have limited ranges of sensitivity to magnetism and/or superconductivity. For instance, neutron scattering and magnetic susceptibility measurements can only reveal volume-integrated information about the magnetic and SC features of the specimens. At present, no individual experimental probe can unambiguously address the issue of whether the coexistence of AFM and SC orders directly overlap in real space or if the specimen undergoes macroscopic phase separation between two phases. In an attempt to clear this experimental hurdle, a detailed multiple-probe investigation was recently conducted on BaFe_{2-x}Ni_{x}As_{2}, involving muon spin rotation (\muSR), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), Mossbauer spectroscopy, neutron scattering, and specific heat measurements [12]. The results from this study offer convincing evidence that the AFM and SC phases in BaFe_{2-x}Ni_{x}As_{2} almost completely overlap in real space and both phases compete for the same electrons. The question of whether a similar style of phase coexistence exists in other families of Fe-HTS remains unclear. In this paper, we present a detailed \muSR investigation in context with recent susceptibility and neutron scattering measurements to gain a deeper understanding of the interplay between AFM and SC orders in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As, a member of the "111" family of Fe-HTS.

Recent neutron scattering experiments on NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As show that the neutron magnetic order parameter is diminished below T_{\text{C}}[18], which was interpreted as the reduction of the magnetic moment below T_{\text{C}}. Using the volume sensitive \muSR technique, we demonstrate in single crystalline samples of NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As, with x= 0.6, 1.0, 1.3, and 1.5%, that the reduction of magnetic intensity is due to a strong reduction of _both_ the ordered moment and the magnetic volume fraction below T_{\text{C}}. The debilitating effect of superconductivity on magnetism intensifies as the doping level x increases, leading to a reentrant non-AFM state below T_{\text{C}} for x= 1.3%. These results suggest an interesting scenario, in which the degree of competition between AFM and SC may be itself intrinsically inhomogeneous, varying as a function of position in the sample. Moreover, we establish a robust linear dependence between the ordered moment and the AFM ordering temperature T_{\text{N}} for various Fe-HTS, which is consistent with a model of itinerant magnetism in Fe-HTS.

This paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the preparation and handling of the specimens, dc-susceptibility characterization, and the \muSR experimental setup. Experimental zero-field \muSR results are shown in Sec. III. A and compared with neutron scattering results in Sec. III.2. A discussion of these results is presented in Sec. III.3. Section IV introduces a muon stopping site simulation performed to account for the multiple internal magnetic fields observed in the zero-field \muSR spectra. Knowledge of the muon site locations enables the ordered moment size to be determined from the observed precession frequency. Section V describes a universal linear relation between the ordered moment size and T_{\text{N}}. A theoretical discussion of this result using a model of antiferromagnetism in Fe-HTS parent compounds based on an itinerant electron picture is also presented in this section. Section VI shows \muSR measurements under a transverse external field on superconducting NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As and demonstrates that a linear relationship between the superfluid density and T_{\text{C}} is observed in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As and other high-T_{\text{C}} cuprate superconductors. These results are summarized in the concluding Sec. VII. Appendix A describes detailed methods and results of the internal field simulation. A calculation for the universal scaling of the ordered moment size and ordering temperature based on a two-band model is presented in Appendix B. Finally, Appendix C provides a derivation of the superconducting gap symmetry from the temperature dependence of the penetration depth.
  crystal specimens were mounted on an ultralow background sample holder using aluminum tape.

In a \muSR experiment, positive muons implanted into a specimen serve as extremely sensitive local probes to simultaneously measure small internal magnetic fields and ordered magnetic volume fractions. Therefore, we can ascertain the temperature and doping evolution of the magnetic volume fraction and ordered moment separately, unlike reciprocal-space techniques such as neutron scattering. Time differential \muSR measurements were performed using the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF) spectrometer with a helium gas-flow cryostat at the M20 surface muon beamline (500 MeV) of TRIUMF in Vancouver, Canada and using the general purpose surface-muon instrument (GPS) with a standard low-background veto setup at the \piM3 beam line of the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland. A continuous beam of 100% spin polarized muons was implanted into the sample and the time dependence of the ensemble muon polarization was collected at temperatures between 2 K and 70 K. The muon beam momentum was parallel to the crystal c axis. By applying magnetic fields to the muon beam before the sample, the ensemble muon spin prior to implantation can be oriented parallel or perpendicular to the beam direction. See Refs. [25-27] for further details on the \muSR experimental technique. The \muSR spectra were analyzed in the time domain using least-squares optimization routines from the musrfit software suite [28].

## III Magnetism in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As

### Zero field \muSR results

The observed \muSR time spectra (muon ensemble polarization) of x=0, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 1.3, and 1.5% in zero applied field (ZF-\muSR) are shown in Fig. 2. In these measurements, the initial muon spin polarization is in the a-b plane of the crystals, and the time spectra were obtained using up and down positron counters. At high temperatures, only a very faint depolarization of the \muSR signal is observed. This weak relaxation mostly originates from the interaction of the muon spin with randomly oriented nuclear magnetic moments. Upon cooling, the relaxation of the \muSR signal increases due to the proliferation of Fe-spin correlations.

For x=0 and 0.4% samples, three distinct precession frequencies occur in the \muSR spectra, which emanate from three magnetically inequivalent muon stopping sites in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As, in agreement with our stopping site calculations presented in Sec. IV. No coherent oscillations are present in the x\gtrsim 0.6% spectra shown in Figs. 2(e)-2(f), even at the lowest measured temperature, as only a rapidly relaxing signal is observed. The fast depolarization of the \muSR signal (without oscillations) arises from a broad distribution of static internal magnetic fields, which has been confirmed using longitudinal field (LF)-\muSR experiments. These measurements reveal that the muon spin relaxation is substantially suppressed at modest longitudinal external fields between 25 and 50 mT (of the order of internal quasistatic fields), suggesting an inhomogeneous magnetic state in the samples with x=0.6, 1.0, and 1.3%. The ZF-\muSR time spectra for the x=1.3% compound shown in Fig. 2(g) demonstrate magnetic ordering between 14 K and 17 K. Below 14 K, magnetic order vanishes and the specimen only exhibits bulk superconductivity. Interestingly, a similar reentrance to a nonmagnetic state was observed in BaFe_{2-x}Co_{x}As_{2} by neutron diffraction [15]. In the following, we present how the magnetic properties of NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As evolve with temperature and doping.

(b) Phase diagram of NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As illustrating temperature and doping dependences of various orders, with structural and magnetic transitions obtained from Ref. [18] and displayed as fully-colored symbols. Superconducting transition temperatures T_{\rm C} were determined from magnetic susceptibility measurements shown in (a). Black arrows indicate the doping concentrations measured by \muSR in our present investigation. (c) Collinear AFM spin structure of the undoped compound NaFeAs [19,20]. Only Fe atoms (green) are shown for visual clarity. Dashed lines indicate the boundaries of a single unit cell of the crystal structure.

  All of the ZF-\muSR spectra were fit to the following phenomenological model:

\[P_{\rm ZF}(t) = F\left(\sum_{j=1}^{3}\big{(}f_{j}\cos(2\pi\,v_{j}t+\phi)e^{-\lambda _{j}t}\big{)}+f_{L}e^{-\lambda_{L}t}\right)\] \[+(1-F)\bigg{(}\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{3}\big{(}1-\lambda t-(\sigma t) ^{2}\big{)}e^{-\lambda t-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma t)^{2}}\bigg{)}.\]

The model in (1) consists of an anisotropic magnetic contribution characterized by an oscillating "transverse" component and a slowly relaxing "longitudinal" component. The longitudinal component arises due to the parallel orientation of the muon spin polarization and the local magnetic field. In polycrystalline samples with randomly oriented fields this results in a so-called "one-third tail" with f_{L}=\frac{1}{3}. For single crystals, f_{L} varies between zero and unity as the orientation between field and polarization changes from being parallel to perpendicular. In addition to the magnetically ordered contribution, there is a PM signal component characterized by the densely distributed network of nuclear dipolar moments \sigma and dilute electronic moments with random orientations \lambda[29]. The temperature-dependent magnetic ordering fraction 0\leqslant F\leqslant 1 governs the trade-off between magnetically-ordered and PM behaviors.

Shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) are the temperature dependences of the precession frequencies observed in the x=0 and 0.4\% samples. For the undoped and x=0.4\% systems, there are three distinct frequencies that share the same relationship v(T)=v(0)(1-(\frac{T}{T_{N}})^{a})^{b}, which are indicated by solid lines. In the parent system, a sharp steplike increase of v(T) is observed below T_{\rm N}\approx 42 K, which may be a signature of a first-order phase transition, although further experiments are needed to establish the character of the transition. This feature is absent in the x=0.4\% sample, which could be due to disorder effects introduced by Ni impurities [30]. Similar ZF-\muSR experiments were also performed by using positron counters located in the forward and backward directions with respect to the muon beam direction. Interestingly, the two fast frequencies are absent in the non-spin-rotated spectra for x=0 and 0.4\%. If we associate each frequency to a different muon stopping site, these results suggest that the magnetic field directions at the high-field stopping sites are oriented along the c axis of the crystal. This feature is consistent with dipolar field simulations on muon stopping sites presented in Sec. IV.

We define the static magnetic order parameter \mathcal{M}\equiv\sqrt{(2\pi\,v)^{2}+\lambda_{T}^{2}} to track the temperature and doping dependence of magnetism, where v is the maximum precession frequency and \lambda_{T} is the relaxation rate corresponding to v. As defined, \mathcal{M} takes into account both homogeneous (well-defined precession frequency v) and inhomogeneous contributions (rapid early-time relaxation \lambda_{T}) to the signal. Therefore, the magnetic transition temperature T_{\rm N} corresponds to the onset of \mathcal{M}.

The temperature and doping evolution of the magnetic fraction F and magnetic order parameter \mathcal{M} are shown in Fig. 4. The relative decrease in \mathcal{M} below T_{\rm C} is more pronounced with increased doping, as seen in Fig. 4(b). Indeed, the x=1.3\% sample exhibits reentrant behavior in which the low-temperature state becomes non-AFM below T_{\rm C} within experimental uncertainty. The temperature evolution of the magnetically ordered fraction F is shown in Fig. 4(a). F shows a sharp increase below T_{\rm N} while the onset of SC causes F to decrease when cooled below T_{\rm C}. With higher doping, a stronger reduction of F is observed below T_{\rm C}. For the x=1.3\% system, magnetic order is completely destroyed and the system loses long-range AFM order below 14 K. The evolution of magnetic and SC volume fractions across temperature and doping is presented in Fig. 5.

### Comparison with elastic neutron scattering

Muon spin rotation and neutron scattering are two powerful experimental techniques for studying magnetic materials. As described in Ref. [31], these methods have distinct features

[25; 26; 27].

  that make them complementary probes of magnetism. For instance, both techniques are sensitive to different time scales of dynamic fluctuations. However, since we are probing static magnetic order in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As, both \muSR and elastic neutron scattering should yield consistent results. In addition, as a volume-integrating probe in reciprocal space, neutron scattering is sensitive to both the ordered moment and its volume fraction, but these two contributions cannot be separated from the measured scattered intensity. However, \muSR enables independent measurements of both the volume fraction and the ordered moment size, unlike neutron scattering and other bulk probes.

As described in Sec. I, elastic neutron scattering experiments on NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As reveal that the neutron magnetic order parameter is diminished below T_{\rm C}[18], which was interpreted as the reduction of the magnetic moment below T_{\rm C}. However, the suppression of magnetic order below T_{\rm C} observed in neutron diffraction cannot be unambiguously attributed to a reduction of the magnetic moment, as pointed out in the previous paragraph. A comparison between the neutron magnetic order parameter and the magnetic strength \mathcal{M}^{2}F from our \muSR studies is shown in Fig. 6 for the x=1.0 and 1.3% systems. From our ZF-\muSR results in Fig. 4, we conclude that the suppression of magnetic ordering is due to a decrease in both the ordered volume fraction and the moment size.

### Discussion

Our results offer strong evidence that both the ordered moment and fraction are partially or fully suppressed below T_{\rm C}. The strong suppression of the magnetism below the onset of superconductivity was also observed in the "122" and "11" families of Fe-HTS: BaFe_{2-x}Co_{x}As_{2}[10, 11] (where reentrance of

  the non-AFM phase was reported [15]), BaFe_{2-x}Ni_{x}As_{2}[12], Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}[13], and FeSe [32]. However, we note that in BaFe_{2-x}Co_{x}As_{2} and Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}, only the ordered moment decreases below T_{\rm C}, but the magnetic fraction remains unaffected. Detailed studies of magnetism and superconductivity in the related system NaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}As were previously conducted [14]. In NaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}As, only the ordered moment was diminished below T_{\rm C}. This reduction is much smaller than that of NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. We also noticed that the observed muon precession frequencies in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As and NaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}As follow different patterns. We have found two high frequencies and one low frequency for NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As, while one high frequency and two low frequencies were reported for NaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}As. Although a definitive explanation for these differences requires further studies, it is clear that Ni and Co dopants perturb the electronic structure of NaFeAs in different ways.

Both the ordered moment and magnetic fraction decrease below T_{\rm C} for FeSe (which becomes magnetic under hydrostatic pressure). Results in the present investigation of NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As are similar to the FeSe case. Itinerant AFM and SC orders are generally expected to compete strongly for the same electronic states; this behavior can be captured within a simple Ginzburg-Landau free energy for the AFM and SC order parameters, \mathcal{M} and \Delta, respectively (in the context of Fe-HTS, see for instance Refs. [15,33,34,35]):

\[F=\frac{a_{m}}{2}\mathcal{M}^{2}+\frac{u_{m}}{4}\mathcal{M}^{4}+\frac{a_{s}}{ 2}\Delta^{2}+\frac{u_{s}}{4}\Delta^{4}+\frac{\gamma}{2}\mathcal{M}^{2}\Delta^ {2}\]

The degree of competition between these two orders is encoded in the combination of coefficients g=\gamma/\sqrt{u_{s}u_{m}}. If the

  competition is too strong (g>1), these two orders are macroscopically phase separated and do not coexist microscopically. On the other hand, if the competition is weak (g<1), they can establish a coexistence phase in which both order parameters are simultaneously nonzero at the same position. In a homogeneous system, the first scenario is manifested by a reduction of the AFM volume fraction F below T_{\text{C}} without a change in the size of the magnetic moment. Conversely, the second scenario is manifested by a reduction of the magnetic moment below T_{\text{C}} without any variation in the volume fraction. Interestingly, we observe both signatures in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. Although a detailed theoretical analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, this suggests that the parameter g itself may be inhomogeneous and change as a function of the position in the sample. If Cooper pairs were to form an unconventional sign-changing s^{\pm} state [36, 37], it was argued [15] that the system would be at the verge of phase separation and microscopic coexistence, i.e., g\approx 1. In this case, local inhomogeneity could locally alter the value of g in a significant manner [38].

## IV Internal field simulations at muon stopping sites

To investigate the effect of Ni dopants on the magnetism in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As, we numerically simulate the behavior of the muon in the magnetic environment of NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. In low-temperature \muSR experiments, the incident muons thermalize with the lattice and are implanted at interstitial locations referred to as stopping sites. Muon implantation sites in Fe-HTS have been successfully identified using a succession of increasingly accurate theoretical calculations. Early studies were based on the analysis of the local minima of the unperturbed electrostatic potential within either the simple Thomas Fermi or a full density functional theory (DFT) approach. This strategy was specifically followed for the "1111" [17, 39, 40, 41] and the "11" [32, 42] classes of Fe-HTS. In addition, similar calculations were performed on selected "122" [43, 44] materials and other systems [45, 46]. Recently, and exclusively for the "1111" family of Fe-HTS, the effect of the muon on the lattice was captured within a supercell DFT impurity calculation by considering force and energy relaxations of possible muon implantation sites [47, 48].

The _ab initio_ search often identifies clusters of sites. This is true also in the simple unperturbed potential method that fails in insulators such as fluorides [49] but yields a correct first approximation in the metallic pnictides owing to the electron screening of the muon charge. In this case, the clusters are defined as the portion of the unit cell volume enclosed by the isosurface corresponding to the muon ground state energy. More accurate stopping site determination would require an impurity DFT approach. Under this methodology, clusters of candidate muon sites are generally found with smaller _intracluster_ and larger _inter_cluster energy barriers.

Since muon localization is a metastable epithermal kinetic process that cannot be described by a mere minimum energy criterion, all of these methods uncover clusters of candidate locations that may not directly correspond to observed muon sites. In principle, the true muon fate could be simulated by robust _ab initio_ path integral molecular dynamics [50, 51]. At present, these techniques are computationally prohibitive for impurity calculations on complex structures such as Fe-HTS. Therefore, the most feasible method for muon site determination in Fe-HTS involves comparing the experimental and calculated local field values at candidate sites.

### Candidate muon stopping sites in "111" systems

To determine plausible muon implantation sites in the "111" family of Fe-HTS, we employed DFT methods that account for local crystal deformations and electronic band structure perturbations due to the implanted muons. In particular, muon stopping site calculations in NaFeAs and NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As were performed using spin-polarized DFT with plane wave expansions of the Kohn-Sham orbitals at both atomic and interstitial sites. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was applied for the exchange correlation functional within the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) formalism [52, 53]. Finally, the core wave function was approximated using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method [54]. The plane wave and charge density cutoffs were chosen to be 120 and 1080 Ry, respectively. More details on the muon site determination procedure are found in Appendices A and A 2.

This initial search with DFT methods uncovered five plausible muon sites in NaFeAs, which are also assumed to be valid for lowly doped NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. The five candidate sites were grouped into two clusters based on relative calculated energies. Since the muon is treated as a classical particle within DFT, corrections due to its light mass can be included by taking into account the spread of the muon wave function in the double Born-Oppenheimer (DBO) approximation method [45]. As described in Appendix A.2, we invoked the DBO approximation to examine the relative stability of the five candidate sites. From our stability checks, we concluded that only two of the three muon sites in the low-energy cluster proved to be stable. In addition, both muon sites in the high-energy cluster relax into each other, suggesting that the muon is likely delocalized between these two sites, which are also in close proximity to each other. As a result, we have determined three plausible muon stopping locations (two stopping sites and a delocalized high-energy stopping position) in NaFeAs, which are listed in Table 1.

### Dipolar internal field simulations on NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As

With the muon stopping sites determined, magnetic dipolar field simulations were performed by simulating the NaFeAs as an array of localized magnetic dipoles. The two dipolar contributions considered in the internal field simulation are localized electronic moments from AFM-ordered Fe atoms and random nuclear dipolar moments from all atoms. Nonmagnetic nickel impurities were randomly substituted into the Fe sites on the host NaFeAs lattice to generate NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. By performing a vector sum of the array of (static) electronic and random nuclear dipolar moments, the internal field distribution was numerically simulated for all points in the crystal.

To capture the stochastic fluctuations in the random nuclear moment directions and Ni site substitutions, the internal field distribution was simulated by performing 10 000 independent trials of dipolar sums for each muon site as a function of Ni concentration x. Although simulated results can be  implemented for any x, the simplified dipolar field model severely breaks down beyond x\gtrsim 0.4% since the simulation does not consider bulk superconductivity (see Fig. 1). Magnetic disorder induced by the SC state at x\gtrsim 0.4% could also explain the disappearance of coherent oscillations in the ZF-\muSR spectra in Fig. 2. Additional details on the simulation setup for exploring the local magnetic environment at the NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As stopping sites are found in Appendices A.1 and A.3.

### Discussion of computational results

The main results of our computational investigation are summarized in Table 1. Our stopping site calculations and stability analysis reveal three plausible muon stopping sites in NaFeAs. This is consistent with the observation that there are three precession frequencies in the ZF-\muSR spectra in lightly-doped NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. The calculated precession frequencies are listed in Table 1, along with the extrapolated frequencies from power law fits of the frequencies from \muSR found in Fig. 3(a). Moreover, our simulations show that the mean local fields at the two high-field sites make an acute angle of approximately 36^{\circ} with the crystal c axis, implying that the strong fields at these sites are preferentially aligned with the c axis. This is consistent with our experimental observation that the high frequency oscillations have noticeable amplitudes when the initial muon spin is not aligned with the c axis (i.e., in the spin-rotated configuration), as shown in Fig. 2(a). Differences in the simulated and experimentally-obtained angles \theta suggest that the true muon sites are likely a small displacement from the ones listed in Table 1.

The doping evolution of the simulated precession frequencies are shown in Fig. 3(c). Comparisons of the simulated and observed frequencies for Site 1 in our dipolar field simulations enabled us to estimate the ordered moment size of the Fe atoms in NaFeAs to be \mu_{\rm Fe}=0.175(3)\mu_{\rm B}. The difference between the simulated and experimental frequencies for the second and third sites suggests that quantum correlations (e.g., contact hyperfine fields) contribute to the internal field, which are not included in the dipolar model. In addition, the presence of Ni dopants can perturb the ordering of Fe moments, which was not included in the simulation. Nonetheless, our computational investigation provides a physical interpretation of the frequencies observed in the ZF-\muSR spectra and corroborates the model for the magnetic ordering in (1).

The ordered moment size in a variety of Fe-HTS has been explored experimentally using \muSR, neutron scattering, and Mossbauer measurements [55]. The reported variations of the ordered Fe moments of the same specimen is a testament to the differences in sensitivity across these three probes of the local moment. Table 2 shows a comparison of the ordered moment size of representative systems from the various classes of Fe-HTS. The estimate from our present investigation in NaFeAs, \mu_{\rm Fe}=0.175(3)\mu_{\rm B}, is consistent with the moment sizes reported from neutron scattering [56] and Mossbauer spectroscopy [57].

## V Linear relationship between ordered moment and T_{\rm N}

Despite the notable differences in the experimentally-measured ordered moment sizes across different Fe-HTS [55], there are some notable relationships between the ordered moment and other material parameters. The observation of a linear relationship between the muon precession frequency v and the magnetic ordering temperature T_{\rm N} was initially noted

Separate linear trends in "122" and "1111" classes of Fe-HTS were discovered from Mossbauer spectroscopy relating the internal hyperfine field and the orthorhombic lattice distortion [10]. The different proportionality constants between the two classes of Fe-HTS have been ascribed to the critical dynamics of the structural and magnetic transitions [66, 67]. In this section, we make use of muon stopping site calculations to extend the investigation of the linear trend between the ordered moment size and T_{\rm N} from \muSR results.

### Linear trends from \muSR results

Figure 7 depicts the correlation between the low temperature precession frequency v(T\to 0) and the ordering temperature T_{\rm N} for a variety of Fe-HTS, including NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As from the present investigation. Note that for the SC samples, the values of the precession frequencies, extrapolated to T=0 from above T_{c} are taken. Since the precession frequency v is proportional to the local magnetic field at the muon site, v is proportional to the ordered moment size, and therefore the magnetization. v also depends on the distance between the muon stopping site and the dominant ordered moment (Fe atoms). Remarkably, despite the differences in chemical composition and crystal structure across the various main families of Fe-HTS, (which influence the number and location of the muon stopping sites) a linear trend between v(T\to 0) and T_{\rm N} appears to persist. This suggests that the mechanism responsible for driving the magnetic ordering may be similar across different crystal structures and dopant atoms. Under this linear scaling relationship, there is an increase of 0.244(3) MHz/K between the v(T\to 0) and T_{\rm N}.

Since muon stopping sites have been calculated for a variety of Fe-HTS, we can compare the ordered Fe moment sizes directly. The ordered magnetic moment on the Fe atom can be calculated as the scaling factor necessary for matching the precession frequencies from dipolar field simulations against experimental results. Shown in Fig. 8 is a comparison between the ordered magnetic moment of the Fe atoms and T_{\rm N}. A linear model was fit to the data, revealing that the magnetic moment \mu_{\rm Fe} scales with T_{\rm N} as 0.0062(6) \mu_{\rm B}/{\rm K} across these families of Fe-HTS.

### Discussion

The universal linear relationship between the T\!=\!0 sublattice magnetization M and the experimentally observed T_{\rm N} provides important insight into the nature of the magnetic state. Within an itinerant mean-field approach, in which AFM is driven by Fermi surface nesting, M\propto T_{\rm N} follows naturally whenever the Fermi surfaces are perfectly nested; this is the same relationship between the SC gap function and T_{\rm C} that appears in BCS theory. Since the Fermi pockets of the iron pnictides are not perfectly nested, it is important to verify whether M\propto T_{\rm N} applies more generally in itinerant antiferromagnets. To investigate this issue, we consider a widely studied toy model consisting of one circular hole pocket located at the center of the Brillouin zone and one elliptical electron pocket shifted from the center by the AFM ordering vector [15, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 74]. The mismatch between the Fermi pockets is tuned by two parameters: \delta_{2}, which characterizes the ellipticity of the electron pocket, and \delta_{0}, which describes the difference between the areas of the Fermi pockets (and is therefore indirectly

  related to doping). The case \delta_{0}=\delta_{2}=0 corresponds to perfect nesting, giving T_{\rm N,0}=(\frac{c^{2}}{T})M_{0}\approx 0.567M_{0}.

Following Refs. [15, 33, 34], we compute not only T_{\rm N} as a function of the parameters \delta_{0} and \delta_{2}, but also the magnetization M at T=0. We focus on the regime in which the AFM transition is second order (see Appendix B for details). As shown in Fig. 9, M monotonically increases with increasing T_{\rm N}. Each curve corresponds to a fixed value of \delta_{2} and continuously changing values of \delta_{0}. Interestingly, when \delta_{2} is not too large, T_{\rm N} and M follow a nearly linear relationship over a wide parameter range, which is consistent with previous works [15, 33]. Although a quantitative comparison with experimental findings must account for band structure details of different compounds, the results of this simple model are qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations, suggesting that nesting plays an important role in driving the AFM instability.

## VI Superconductivity in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As

\muSR experiments performed with an applied field transverse to the initial muon ensemble spin, called TF-\muSR, allow determination of the magnetic field penetration depth \lambda, which is one of the fundamental parameters of a superconductor [16]. (Recall that \lambda is related to the superconducting carrier density n_{s} through \lambda^{-2}=\mu_{0}e^{2}n_{s}/m^{*}, where m^{*} is the effective mass and \mu_{0} is the vacuum permeability). Most importantly, the temperature dependence of \lambda is particularly sensitive to the presence of SC nodes. In a fully gapped superconductor, \Delta\lambda^{-2}(T)\equiv\lambda^{-2}(0)-\lambda^{-2}(T) vanishes exponentially at low T and decays as a power of T in a nodal SC. As a result, the \muSR technique is a powerful tool to measure \lambda in type II superconductors. Specifically, \muSR experiments in the vortex state of a type II superconductor allow the determination of \lambda in the bulk of the sample, in contrast to many techniques that probe \lambda only near the surface.

To understand the temperature evolution of \lambda, it is informative to study the symmetry and structure of the SC gap. Significant experimental and theoretical efforts have focused on this issue in Fe-HTS [1, 2]. However, there is no consensus on a universal gap structure and the relevance for the particular gap symmetry for Fe-HTS, which are the first noncuprate materials exhibiting superconductivity at relatively high temperatures.

In contrast to cuprates, where the SC gap symmetry is universal, the gap symmetry and/or structure of the Fe-HTS varies across different systems. For instance, nodeless isotropic gap distributions were observed in optimally doped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}[75, 76], Ba_{1-x}Rb_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}[29], and BaFe_{2-x}Ni_{x}As_{2}[77] as well as in BaFe_{2-x}Co_{x}As_{2}[78], K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}[79], and FeTe_{1-x}Se_{x}[80, 81]. Signatures of nodal SC gaps were reported in LaFePO [82], LiFeP [83], KFe_{2}As_{2}[84], BaFe2(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2}[85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 86, 87, 88], BaFe_{2-x}Ru_{x}As_{2}[89], and FeSe [90] as well as in overdoped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}[91] and in optimally doped Ba_{1-x}Rb_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} under pressure [92]. Therefore, it is fruitful to extend the study of the SC gap symmetry to other Fe-based materials, specifically the "111" family of Fe-HTS. In this section, we present and discuss TF-\muSR results on the x=1.3\% sample in the superconducting state.

### TF-\muSR results

Shown in Fig. 10 are the TF-\muSR time spectra on the x=1.3\% system, measured in an applied field of 300 Oe above (40 K) and below (2 K) T_{\rm C}\approx 15 K. Above T_{\rm C}, the oscillations show a small relaxation due to random local fields from nuclear magnetic moments. As the sample is field cooled below T_{\rm C}, the relaxation steadily increases due to the presence of a nonuniform local field distribution as a result of the formation of a flux-line lattice (FLL) in the SC state. The TF-\muSR spectra were analyzed using the following functional form:

\[P_{\rm TF}(t) = F_{\rm nm}\cos(2\pi\,vt+\phi)\] (2) \[\times\,\exp\,\{-\frac{1}{2}\big{(}\sigma_{\rm nm}^{2}+\sigma_{ \rm SC}^{2}\big{)}t^{2}\big{]}e^{-\lambda_{\rm Mott}t}.\]

The defining parameters in (2) are the precession frequency v, the relaxation rates \sigma_{\rm SC} and \sigma_{\rm nm} characterizing the damping due to the formation of FLL in the SC state and the nuclear magnetic dipolar contribution, respectively, and an exponential relaxation rate for field-induced magnetism \lambda_{\rm Mag}[93]. The model in (2) has been previously used [29, 94] for Fe-HTS in the presence of dilute or fast fluctuating electronic moments

Figure 9: Theoretical calculations of the ordered moment M at T=0 versus the AFM critical temperature T_{\rm N}. The ellipticity of the electron band, given by \delta_{2}, is fixed for each curve, whereas the parameter \delta_{0}, corresponding to doping, is varied continuously. M_{0} is the AFM moment M at T=0 when the hole and electron Fermi pockets are perfectly nested.

  and it was demonstrated to be sufficiently precise for extracting the SC depolarization rate as a function of temperature.

The temperature dependence of v shows a PM shift below T_{\rm C} in Fig. 11(a), which is different from the expected diamagnetic shift imposed by the SC state [29, 94, 95]. It is difficult to elucidate the origin of the PM shift, however the effects are consistent with field-induced magnetism. Other phenomena such as vortex lattice disorder [93] or a Yosida-like decrease of the spin susceptibility [96] may also contribute to this behavior and can be investigated further.

The SC and magnetic relaxation rates, \sigma_{\rm SC} and \lambda_{\rm Mgg}, respectively, are shown in Figs. 11(b) and 11(c), demonstrating an additional effect of a weak contribution of static magnetism to the SC state. We also observe the nonmonotonic temperature dependence of \lambda_{\rm Mgg}, which may be caused by the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity [15, 97]. As the sample is cooled in an external transverse field below T_{\rm C}\approx 15 K, \sigma_{\rm SC} begins to rise from 0 due to the FLL formation. \sigma_{\rm SC} saturates upon further cooling, which resembles the behavior of an isotropic nodeless superconductor.

We found that an isotropic two-band (s+s)-wave SC model describes the temperature dependence of the measured \sigma_{\rm SC} remarkably well [see Figure 11(b)], yielding a large gap \Delta_{1}\simeq 4.5(6) meV and a small gap \Delta_{2}\simeq 1.8(5) meV. Refer to Appendix C for details on the SC gap symmetry analysis. A two-gap scenario is also consistent with the generally accepted view of multigap superconductivity in Fe-HTS [1, 36]. The magnitudes of the large 2\Delta_{1}/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm C}\simeq 6.9(5) and the small 2\Delta_{2}/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm C}\simeq 2.8(5) gap for NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As (x=0.013) are in good agreement with previous work [98]. There it was pointed out that most Fe-HTS exhibit a two-gap SC behavior, characterized by a large gap with magnitude 2\Delta/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm C}\simeq 7(2) and a small gap with 2.5(1.5).

### Connection with other unconventional superconductors

An interesting result of \muSR investigations in Fe-HTS is the observed proportionality between T_{\rm c} and the zero-temperature relaxation rate \sigma(0)\propto\lambda^{-2}(0), known as the Uemura plot [100, 101]. This relation, which seems to be generic for various families of cuprate HTS, has the features that upon increasing the charge carrier doping T_{\rm c} first increases linearly in the underdoped region (blue line in Fig. 12), then saturates, and finally is suppressed for high carrier doping. The initial linear trend of the Uemura relation indicates that for these unconventional HTS, the ratio T_{\rm C}/E_{\rm F} (E_{\rm F} is the Fermi energy)

(b).(c) Temperature dependences of the relaxation rates ascribed to the SC and magnetic orders, respectively. The solid line in (b) represents an isotropic two-band SC model fit to the temperature evolution of \sigma_{\rm SC}. The peak in \lambda_{\rm Mgg} in (c) is close to T_{\rm C}, indicating that the onset of SC order affects the dilute electronic moment distribution.

Figure 12: Uemura plot for hole and electron doped Fe-HTS (see Ref. [99] and references therein). The linear relation observed for underdoped cuprates is shown as a blue colored solid line for hole doping [100, 101] and as a red colored dashed line for electron doped systems [102]. The points for conventional BCS superconductors are also shown. The orange star marker shows the data point for NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As obtained in this work.

  is much larger than that of conventional BCS superconductors. Figure 12 shows T_{\rm C} plotted against \lambda^{-2}(0) for various hole- and electron-doped Fe-HTS (see Ref. [99] and references therein), including the current results on NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. The linear relation observed for underdoped cuprates is also shown as a solid line for hole doped cuprates [100, 101] and as a dashed line for electron doped cuprates [102]. The present data for NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As in the Uemura plot is in close proximity to the line observed in hole-doped cuprates and other Fe-HTS. This connection contrasts with LiFeAs, which shows behavior following electron-doped cuprates. The observation of a reduced superfluid stiffness in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As compared to LiFeAs presents a new challenge for theoretical explanations.

## VII VII. Conclusion

In conclusion, the magnetic and SC properties of NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As were studied as a function of Ni-content x by DC magnetization and \muSR techniques. The long range magnetic order is observed for x=0 and 0.4% samples, while for x>0.4% magnetic order becomes inhomogeneous and is completely suppressed for x=1.5%. The magnetic volume fraction continuously decreases with increasing x. Furthermore, superconductivity acquires its full volume for samples with x\gtrsim 0.4%. This implies that there is a coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. Both the ordered moment and the magnetic volume fraction decrease below T_{\rm C}, showing that magnetism, which develops at higher temperatures, becomes partially (or even fully) suppressed by the onset of superconductivity. These results indicate that the competition between the SC and magnetic order parameters in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As develop in an intrinsically inhomogeneous environment, providing important insight for theoretical modeling. A linear relationship between the T=0 ordered moment and the AFM ordering temperature T_{\rm N} for various Fe-HTS is noted, which is consistent with a mean-field approach for itinerant electrons, in which antiferromagnetism is driven by Fermi surface nesting. From TF-\muSR measurements, the temperature evolution of the penetration depth in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As is consistent with an isotropic two-gap (s+s)-wave model for superconductivity.

## Appendix A Internal Field Simulation

### Initialization of Crystal Properties

At low temperatures, NaFeAs crystallizes into the Cmme space group, with the following assumed lattice constants for the orthorhombic structure based on Ref. [19]: a=5.6834 A, b=5.6223 A, and c=6.9063 A. Stopping site calculations and subsequent dipolar field calculations were performed on NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As with the atomic properties displayed in Table 3. The sample was assumed to be in the low temperature ordered state with Fe spins aligned in the usual collinear AFM arrangement as depicted in Fig. 1(d).

### Muon Stopping Site Determination

The search for muon sites was initiated by sampling a 4\times 4\times 4 grid of possible interstitial positions in the NaFeAs lattice that are at least 1 A away from lattice atoms. Symmetry-equivalent points in the search grid were removed with the space group symmetry of the lattice. The stability of a H atom in a 2\times 2\times 2 supercell consisting of 96 Na-Fe-As atoms was examined at each point in the grid. A 2\times 2\times 2 Monkhorst-Pack grid of \vec{k} points was used for Brillouin zone sampling. DFT calculations were carried out assuming the usual collinear magnetic ordering of Fe atoms in NaFeAs

  as shown in Fig. 1(d) [19]. To accommodate for structural relaxations, the forces were optimized till a threshold of 10^{-3} atomic units and the energies till a threshold of 10^{-4} atomic units. Table 4 lists five candidate muon sites for NaFeAs using this first-order search procedure. These sites are also assumed to be compatible for lowly doped NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As.

We group the five candidate sites into two clusters based on stability checks using the double Born-Oppenheimer approximation method (DBO) [45], which takes into account the quantum description of the muon. Within this method, a potential exploration algorithm (PEA) is used to efficiently sample the _a priori_ unknown potential felt by the muon. With the sampling of the potential, site C is observed to be a local minimum in the muon potential. Site C relaxes towards sites A and B since site C has very low barrier less than 0.24 eV that is too small to bind the muon. Sites A and B are also close in proximity to each other and in energy difference. Consequently, we associate sites A, B, and C together as cluster I. Similarly, we also observe that sites E and D relax into each other, which together form cluster II. Our clustering also explains the observed frequencies--cluster I contains the low DFT energy sites that describe the high muon field observed from experiment, while cluster II contains sites that correspond to the low field.

Shown in Fig. 13 are the results of further analysis of the sites in cluster II. The energy profile extracted from the DBO potential map can be represented by the toy model shown in Fig. 13. This enables us to solve the Schrodinger equation of the muon, yielding a ground state energy of 0.17 eV (independent of the interpolation method and the boundary condition, to some extent) which is greater than the barrier seen in the potential map. These findings suggest that the muon wave function for the low field sites may be delocalized over positions between sites D and E (hereafter the D-E site). As a result, the low frequency detected from experiments may come from an averaging of the field at the two sites. Following analysis considering the quantum nature of the muon due to its light mass, we propose that sites A, B, and D-E are the possible implantation sites of the muon.

DBO would still predict a zero average at the D-E sites probed by the muon wave function due to the symmetry of the sites in the lattice. However a DFT mapping of the total energy and a separate solution of the muon Schrodinger equation may not give the final answer, since the muon quantum nature is ignored in the DFT assessment of the total energy. The actual muon site may still be slightly distorting the local environment, thus justifying the small but nonvanishing low precession frequency listed in Table 4.

## 3 Low Temperature Dipolar Field Simulation

A 9\times 9\times 9 supercell of magnetic dipoles was used to model the internal field of NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. Dipole positions and strengths for the idealized crystal structure in NaFeAs listed in Table 3. Nuclear dipole moment directions are assumed to be random for all atoms while the spins on Fe are assumed to take on a collinear AFM striped pattern, common to other Fe-HTS. To simulate the effect of doping, the magnetic Fe atoms are randomly substituted with nonmagnetic Ni atoms to achieve the desired Ni concentration x. The dipolar field at the muon site was obtained by summing over all dipoles in the NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As supercell.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c} Cluster & Label & Symmetry & Site Positiona  & \Delta E (meV)b  & Field \overline{|B|} (G)c  & Frequency v (MHz)d  & Angle \theta (c)f  \\ \hline I & A & 8n & (0.100, 0.750, 0.100) & 0 & 578.5(2.1) & 7.839(30) & 42.1(5) \\ I & B & 8m & (0.000, 0.875, 0.100) & 42 & 810.9(3.5) & 10.987(49) & 31.1(6) \\ I & C & 8l & (0.250, 0.500, 0.250) & 183 & 488.3(4.1) & 6.616(56) & 88.6(4) \\ II & D & 4b & (0.750, 0.500, 0.500) & 287 & 1.002(69) & 0.014(40) & 0.2(3) \\ II & E  By comparing the simulated frequencies, shown in Table 4, with the experimental results, we can associate the two high frequencies v_{1} and v_{2} with sites B and A, respectively. The low frequency v_{3} corresponds best with site E of cluster II. However, our stability analysis shows that the muon is likely delocalized over sites D and E. A comparison between simulated and experimental results is presented in Table 1. Our simulations show that the experimentally observed frequency v_{1}=10.9 MHz in NaFeAs corresponds to an ordered Fe moment size of about \mu_{\rm Fe}=0.175(3)\mu_{\rm B}.

## Appendix B Ordered moment scaling calculations

In this section, we present a description of the two-band model discussed in Sec. V and introduced in Refs. [33, 34]. The effective free energy density of the model can be written as

\[f=\frac{2\mathcal{M}^{2}}{I}-\frac{T}{\upsilon}\sum_{\alpha_{\rm t}}\sum_{ \bm{k}}\ln\big{[}\big{(}\omega_{n}^{2}+E_{+,\bm{k}}^{2}\big{)}\big{(}\omega_{n }^{2}+E_{-,\bm{k}}^{2}\big{)}\big{]},\] (21)

where \mathcal{M} is the temperature dependent ordered AFM moment, I>0 is the AFM interaction coupling constant, \omega_{n}=2\pi T(n+1/2) is a fermionic Matsubara frequency (n\in\mathbb{Z}), \upsilon is the volume of the system, and

\[E_{\pm,\bm{k}}=\sqrt{\mathcal{M}^{2}+\xi_{k}^{2}}\pm|\delta_{0}|.\]

Here, \xi_{k}=k^{2}/2m-\epsilon_{0} is a parabolic energy dispersion, \theta is the angle in the Fermi surface between the momentum \bm{k} and the x axis, and \delta_{0}\equiv\delta_{0}+\delta_{2}\cos(2\theta) describes deviations from the perfect nesting condition.

The momentum sum can be evaluated as \frac{1}{\upsilon}\sum_{\bm{k}}\rightarrow\frac{m}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty }\mathrm{d}\xi\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{d\theta}{2\pi}. We minimize f in (21) with respect to \mathcal{M} and perform the \mathrm{d}\xi integration to obtain

\[\frac{\mathcal{M}}{mI}=T\sum_{0<\omega_{n}<\Lambda}\int\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta} {2\pi}\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}\frac{\mathcal{M}}{\sqrt{\mathcal{M}^{2}+(\omega_{n }+i|\delta_{0}|)^{2}}},\] (22)

where \Lambda is a high-frequency cutoff. At T=0, we integrated over frequencies to obtain

\[\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}\int\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{2\pi}\ln\bigg{(}i|\delta_{0}| +\sqrt{M^{2}-\delta_{0}^{2}}\bigg{)}=\ln M_{0},\] (23)

where M\equiv\mathcal{M}(T=0) and M_{0}\equiv 2\Lambda e^{-2\pi/mI} is the value of M for \delta_{0}=0=\delta_{2}.

When the transition is second order, T_{\rm N} is the temperature at which \mathcal{M}(T\to T_{\rm N})\to 0. Setting \mathcal{M}=0 in (22) and performing the Matsubara sum yields

\[2\ln\bigg{(}\frac{4\pi\,T_{\rm N}}{M_{0}}\bigg{)}+\int\frac{ \mathrm{d}\theta}{2\pi}\bigg{[}\psi\bigg{(}\frac{1}{2}+\frac{i\delta_{0}}{2\pi \,T_{\rm N}}\bigg{)}\] \[\quad+\psi\bigg{(}\frac{1}{2}-\frac{i\delta_{0}}{2\pi\,T_{\rm N} }\bigg{)}\bigg{]}=0,\] (24)

where \psi(z)\equiv\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z}\ln\Gamma(z) is the digamma function.

We have numerically calculated the remaining angular integral in the self-consistent equations (23) and (24) to determine the behavior of M and T_{\rm N} as functions of \delta_{0} and \delta_{2}. For fixed \delta_{2}, the transition is second order at small \delta_{0} but becomes first order at larger \delta_{0}. Moreover, there is no ordered AFM state [34] for \delta_{2}>M_{0}. On the other hand, the ordered magnetic moment at T=0 generally increases with decreasing \delta_{0} and \delta_{2} and abruptly saturates at \delta_{0}+\delta_{2}=M_{0}. These results are presented in Fig. 14. More importantly, these results enable us to plot and examine the behavior of the ordered moment at T=0 vs T_{\rm N}, which is shown in Fig. 9.

## Appendix C Tf-\muSr SC gap analysis

To explore the SC gap symmetry, we recall that the penetration depth \lambda(T) (in an isotropic superconductor) is related to the quadratic relaxation rate \sigma_{\rm SC}(T) through \sigma_{\rm SC}(T)=k\gamma_{\mu}\Phi_{0}\lambda^{-2}(T), where \gamma_{\mu} is the muon gyromagnetic ratio, \Phi_{0}\equiv\frac{1}{2\sigma} is the quantum of magnetic flux, and k\approx 0.06091 is a geometric factor characterizing the FLL [25, 103]. The temperature evolution of \lambda(T) can be modeled for a variety of SC gap symmetries and structures.

Within the local London limit of electrodynamics (where the penetration depth \lambda is much greater than the SC coherence length \xi), the \alpha model is a popular phenomenological

Figure 14: Summary of numerical results for the ordered moment M and T_{\rm N}. (a) Ordered moment M at T=0 and (b) T_{\rm N} as functions of the area difference parameter \delta_{0} for fixed values of the ellipticity parameter \delta_{2}. Results are shown in the regime where the transition is second order. Colors represent different values of \delta_{2}/M_{0} listed in Fig. 9.

  framework used to study multiband superconductivity [104; 105; 106]. The \alpha model assumes that the SC gaps in different bands are independent from each other (aside from sharing a common T_{\text{C}}) and that the normalized penetration depth \frac{\lambda(T)}{\lambda(0)} follows the same temperature dependence as in the single-band clean-limit BCS theory. A two-band \alpha model in which the superfluid densities from each band are added together was used to analyze the TF-\muSR results:

\[\frac{\sigma_{\text{SC}}(T)}{\sigma_{\text{SC}}(0)}=\sum_{j=1}^{2}f_{j}\frac{ \lambda^{-2}(T,\tilde{\Delta}_{j})}{\lambda^{-2}(0,\tilde{\Delta}_{j})},\] (10)

where \tilde{\Delta}_{j} is the maximum value of the SC gap at T=0 for each band (j=1,2). The relative contributions from each band are imposed through the constraint \sum_{j=1}^{2}f_{j}=1 in (10).

Assuming that the Fermi velocity is constant in magnitude, the penetration depth is determined through the integral expression [107]:

\[\frac{\lambda^{-2}(T,\tilde{\Delta}_{j})}{\lambda^{-2}(0,\tilde{ \Delta}_{j})} =1+\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\text{d}\varphi\int_{\tilde{\Delta }_{j}}^{\infty}E\,\text{d}E\times\cdots\] \[\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial E}\right)\frac{1}{\sqrt{E^{2}- \Delta_{j}^{2}(T,\varphi)}},\] (11)

where f(E)\equiv[1+\exp(E/k_{\text{B}}T)]^{-1} is the Fermi function. The SC gap functions \Delta_{j}(T,\varphi) in (11) are assumed to have the separable form: \Delta_{j}(T,\varphi)=\tilde{\Delta}_{j}g(\frac{T}{\varepsilon})S(\varphi). The temperature dependence of the gap is approximated by the function g(t)=\tanh[\alpha(\beta(t^{-1}-1)^{y})], with \alpha=1.82, \beta=1.018, and \delta=0.51[107]. The SC gap symmetry is embedded in S(\varphi), which is defined to be 1 for s-wave and (s+s)-wave gaps and |\cos(2\psi)| for d-wave gaps. The results of applying (10) to the x=1.3% system are shown in Fig. 11(b), demonstrating that the two-band \alpha model with an (s+s)-wave SC gap is a feasible model for the data.

###### Abstract

Muon spin rotation and relaxation studies have been performed on a "111" family of iron-based superconductors, NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As, using single crystalline samples with Ni concentrations x=0, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 1.3, and 1.5%. Static magnetic order was characterized by obtaining the temperature and doping dependences of the local ordered magnetic moment size and the volume fraction of the magnetically ordered regions. For x=0 and 0.4%, a transition to a nearly-homogeneous long range magnetically ordered state is observed, while for x\gtrsim 0.4% magnetic order becomes more disordered and is completely suppressed for x=1.5%. The magnetic volume fraction continuously decreases with increasing x. Development of superconductivity in the full volume is inferred from Meissner shielding results for x\gtrsim 0.4%. The combination of magnetic and superconducting volumes implies that a spatially-overlapping coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity spans a large region of the T-x phase diagram for NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. As a strong reduction of both the ordered moment size and the volume fraction is observed below the superconducting T_{\rm C} for x=0.6, 1.0, and 1.3%, in contrast to other iron pnictides in which one of these two parameters exhibits a reduction below T_{\rm C}, but not both. The suppression of magnetic order is further enhanced with increased Ni doping, leading to a reentrant nonmagnetic state below T_{\rm C} for x=1.3%. The reentrant behavior indicates an interplay between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity involving competition for the same electrons. These observations are consistent with the sign-changing s^{\pm} superconducting state, which is expected to appear on the verge of microscopic coexistence and phase separation with magnetism. We also present a universal linear relationship between the local ordered moment size and the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature T_{\rm N} across a variety of iron-based superconductors. We argue that this linear relationship is consistent with an itinerant-electron approach, in which Fermi surface nesting drives antiferromagnetic ordering. In studies of superconducting properties, we find that the T=0 limit of superfluid density follows the linear trend observed in underdoped cuprates when plotted against T_{\rm C}. This paper also includes a detailed theoretical prediction of the muon stopping sites and provides comparisons with experimental results.

## I Introduction

Iron-based high temperature superconductors (Fe-HTS) are materials exhibiting unconventional superconductivity that arise from parent compounds with static antiferromagnetic (AFM) order [1, 2, 3]. One of the grand challenges in understanding the behavior of these systems is determining the physical mechanism responsible for superconductivity. Essential information on the nature of superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems can be deduced by investigating their phase diagrams as well as the superconducting (SC) gap structure.

In the parent compound of many Fe-HTS, a spin density wave forms with spins ordered antiparallel to each other along one Fe-Fe axis and parallel to each other along the orthog  onal Fe-Fe bond direction [1,2,4]. Carrier doping, isovalent chemical substitution, or application of pressure to the parent system suppresses magnetic order and begets a SC dome [5]. In addition to magnetism and superconductivity, Fe-HTS exhibit a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural distortion at a temperature T_{\text{S}} that precedes or occurs concurrently with the magnetic phase transition at temperature T_{\text{N}}[1,3,4,6,7]. The prominent in-plane anisotropy in resistivity along orthogonal axes in the paramagnetic (PM) orthorhombic state is associated with an electronic nematic order parameter that triggers the orthorhombic distortion of the crystal [8,9]. The aforementioned orders are found in close proximity with each other. AFM and SC orders homogeneously coexist in several Fe-HTS, such as in BaFe_{2-x}Co_{x}As_{2}[10,11], BaFe_{2-x}Ni_{x}As_{2}[12], Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}[13], and NaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}As [14]. In these systems, the ordered magnetic moment size and nematic order parameter smoothly decrease as the temperature is lowered below T_{\text{C}}, corroborating the fact that superconductivity and magnetic long range order compete for the same electrons [15]. However, other studies [16,17] have detected the mutual exclusion of these two order parameters, i.e., they exhibit macroscopic phase separation in different parts of the sample. Characterizing common features of the complex interplay among magnetic, nematic, and SC orders in various Fe-HTS is essential for elucidating the microscopic pairing mechanism in Fe-HTS and other unconventional superconductors.

One of the major experimental challenges in teasing apart AFM and SC orders is that individual experimental probes have limited ranges of sensitivity to magnetism and/or superconductivity. For instance, neutron scattering and magnetic susceptibility measurements can only reveal volume-integrated information about the magnetic and SC features of the specimens. At present, no individual experimental probe can unambiguously address the issue of whether the coexistence of AFM and SC orders directly overlap in real space or if the specimen undergoes macroscopic phase separation between two phases. In an attempt to clear this experimental hurdle, a detailed multiple-probe investigation was recently conducted on BaFe_{2-x}Ni_{x}As_{2}, involving muon spin rotation (\muSR), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), Mossbauer spectroscopy, neutron scattering, and specific heat measurements [12]. The results from this study offer convincing evidence that the AFM and SC phases in BaFe_{2-x}Ni_{x}As_{2} almost completely overlap in real space and both phases compete for the same electrons. The question of whether a similar style of phase coexistence exists in other families of Fe-HTS remains unclear. In this paper, we present a detailed \muSR investigation in context with recent susceptibility and neutron scattering measurements to gain a deeper understanding of the interplay between AFM and SC orders in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As, a member of the "111" family of Fe-HTS.

Recent neutron scattering experiments on NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As show that the neutron magnetic order parameter is diminished below T_{\text{C}}[18], which was interpreted as the reduction of the magnetic moment below T_{\text{C}}. Using the volume sensitive \muSR technique, we demonstrate in single crystalline samples of NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As, with x= 0.6, 1.0, 1.3, and 1.5%, that the reduction of magnetic intensity is due to a strong reduction of _both_ the ordered moment and the magnetic volume fraction below T_{\text{C}}. The debilitating effect of superconductivity on magnetism intensifies as the doping level x increases, leading to a reentrant non-AFM state below T_{\text{C}} for x= 1.3%. These results suggest an interesting scenario, in which the degree of competition between AFM and SC may be itself intrinsically inhomogeneous, varying as a function of position in the sample. Moreover, we establish a robust linear dependence between the ordered moment and the AFM ordering temperature T_{\text{N}} for various Fe-HTS, which is consistent with a model of itinerant magnetism in Fe-HTS.

This paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the preparation and handling of the specimens, dc-susceptibility characterization, and the \muSR experimental setup. Experimental zero-field \muSR results are shown in Sec. III. A and compared with neutron scattering results in Sec. III.2. A discussion of these results is presented in Sec. III.3. Section IV introduces a muon stopping site simulation performed to account for the multiple internal magnetic fields observed in the zero-field \muSR spectra. Knowledge of the muon site locations enables the ordered moment size to be determined from the observed precession frequency. Section V describes a universal linear relation between the ordered moment size and T_{\text{N}}. A theoretical discussion of this result using a model of antiferromagnetism in Fe-HTS parent compounds based on an itinerant electron picture is also presented in this section. Section VI shows \muSR measurements under a transverse external field on superconducting NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As and demonstrates that a linear relationship between the superfluid density and T_{\text{C}} is observed in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As and other high-T_{\text{C}} cuprate superconductors. These results are summarized in the concluding Sec. VII. Appendix A describes detailed methods and results of the internal field simulation. A calculation for the universal scaling of the ordered moment size and ordering temperature based on a two-band model is presented in Appendix B. Finally, Appendix C provides a derivation of the superconducting gap symmetry from the temperature dependence of the penetration depth.
  crystal specimens were mounted on an ultralow background sample holder using aluminum tape.

In a \muSR experiment, positive muons implanted into a specimen serve as extremely sensitive local probes to simultaneously measure small internal magnetic fields and ordered magnetic volume fractions. Therefore, we can ascertain the temperature and doping evolution of the magnetic volume fraction and ordered moment separately, unlike reciprocal-space techniques such as neutron scattering. Time differential \muSR measurements were performed using the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF) spectrometer with a helium gas-flow cryostat at the M20 surface muon beamline (500 MeV) of TRIUMF in Vancouver, Canada and using the general purpose surface-muon instrument (GPS) with a standard low-background veto setup at the \piM3 beam line of the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland. A continuous beam of 100% spin polarized muons was implanted into the sample and the time dependence of the ensemble muon polarization was collected at temperatures between 2 K and 70 K. The muon beam momentum was parallel to the crystal c axis. By applying magnetic fields to the muon beam before the sample, the ensemble muon spin prior to implantation can be oriented parallel or perpendicular to the beam direction. See Refs. [25-27] for further details on the \muSR experimental technique. The \muSR spectra were analyzed in the time domain using least-squares optimization routines from the musrfit software suite [28].

## III Magnetism in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As

### Zero field \muSR results

The observed \muSR time spectra (muon ensemble polarization) of x=0, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 1.3, and 1.5% in zero applied field (ZF-\muSR) are shown in Fig. 2. In these measurements, the initial muon spin polarization is in the a-b plane of the crystals, and the time spectra were obtained using up and down positron counters. At high temperatures, only a very faint depolarization of the \muSR signal is observed. This weak relaxation mostly originates from the interaction of the muon spin with randomly oriented nuclear magnetic moments. Upon cooling, the relaxation of the \muSR signal increases due to the proliferation of Fe-spin correlations.

For x=0 and 0.4% samples, three distinct precession frequencies occur in the \muSR spectra, which emanate from three magnetically inequivalent muon stopping sites in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As, in agreement with our stopping site calculations presented in Sec. IV. No coherent oscillations are present in the x\gtrsim 0.6% spectra shown in Figs. 2(e)-2(f), even at the lowest measured temperature, as only a rapidly relaxing signal is observed. The fast depolarization of the \muSR signal (without oscillations) arises from a broad distribution of static internal magnetic fields, which has been confirmed using longitudinal field (LF)-\muSR experiments. These measurements reveal that the muon spin relaxation is substantially suppressed at modest longitudinal external fields between 25 and 50 mT (of the order of internal quasistatic fields), suggesting an inhomogeneous magnetic state in the samples with x=0.6, 1.0, and 1.3%. The ZF-\muSR time spectra for the x=1.3% compound shown in Fig. 2(g) demonstrate magnetic ordering between 14 K and 17 K. Below 14 K, magnetic order vanishes and the specimen only exhibits bulk superconductivity. Interestingly, a similar reentrance to a nonmagnetic state was observed in BaFe_{2-x}Co_{x}As_{2} by neutron diffraction [15]. In the following, we present how the magnetic properties of NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As evolve with temperature and doping.

(b) Phase diagram of NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As illustrating temperature and doping dependences of various orders, with structural and magnetic transitions obtained from Ref. [18] and displayed as fully-colored symbols. Superconducting transition temperatures T_{\rm C} were determined from magnetic susceptibility measurements shown in (a). Black arrows indicate the doping concentrations measured by \muSR in our present investigation. (c) Collinear AFM spin structure of the undoped compound NaFeAs [19,20]. Only Fe atoms (green) are shown for visual clarity. Dashed lines indicate the boundaries of a single unit cell of the crystal structure.

  All of the ZF-\muSR spectra were fit to the following phenomenological model:

\[P_{\rm ZF}(t) = F\left(\sum_{j=1}^{3}\big{(}f_{j}\cos(2\pi\,v_{j}t+\phi)e^{-\lambda _{j}t}\big{)}+f_{L}e^{-\lambda_{L}t}\right)\] \[+(1-F)\bigg{(}\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{3}\big{(}1-\lambda t-(\sigma t) ^{2}\big{)}e^{-\lambda t-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma t)^{2}}\bigg{)}.\]

The model in (1) consists of an anisotropic magnetic contribution characterized by an oscillating "transverse" component and a slowly relaxing "longitudinal" component. The longitudinal component arises due to the parallel orientation of the muon spin polarization and the local magnetic field. In polycrystalline samples with randomly oriented fields this results in a so-called "one-third tail" with f_{L}=\frac{1}{3}. For single crystals, f_{L} varies between zero and unity as the orientation between field and polarization changes from being parallel to perpendicular. In addition to the magnetically ordered contribution, there is a PM signal component characterized by the densely distributed network of nuclear dipolar moments \sigma and dilute electronic moments with random orientations \lambda[29]. The temperature-dependent magnetic ordering fraction 0\leqslant F\leqslant 1 governs the trade-off between magnetically-ordered and PM behaviors.

Shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) are the temperature dependences of the precession frequencies observed in the x=0 and 0.4\% samples. For the undoped and x=0.4\% systems, there are three distinct frequencies that share the same relationship v(T)=v(0)(1-(\frac{T}{T_{N}})^{a})^{b}, which are indicated by solid lines. In the parent system, a sharp steplike increase of v(T) is observed below T_{\rm N}\approx 42 K, which may be a signature of a first-order phase transition, although further experiments are needed to establish the character of the transition. This feature is absent in the x=0.4\% sample, which could be due to disorder effects introduced by Ni impurities [30]. Similar ZF-\muSR experiments were also performed by using positron counters located in the forward and backward directions with respect to the muon beam direction. Interestingly, the two fast frequencies are absent in the non-spin-rotated spectra for x=0 and 0.4\%. If we associate each frequency to a different muon stopping site, these results suggest that the magnetic field directions at the high-field stopping sites are oriented along the c axis of the crystal. This feature is consistent with dipolar field simulations on muon stopping sites presented in Sec. IV.

We define the static magnetic order parameter \mathcal{M}\equiv\sqrt{(2\pi\,v)^{2}+\lambda_{T}^{2}} to track the temperature and doping dependence of magnetism, where v is the maximum precession frequency and \lambda_{T} is the relaxation rate corresponding to v. As defined, \mathcal{M} takes into account both homogeneous (well-defined precession frequency v) and inhomogeneous contributions (rapid early-time relaxation \lambda_{T}) to the signal. Therefore, the magnetic transition temperature T_{\rm N} corresponds to the onset of \mathcal{M}.

The temperature and doping evolution of the magnetic fraction F and magnetic order parameter \mathcal{M} are shown in Fig. 4. The relative decrease in \mathcal{M} below T_{\rm C} is more pronounced with increased doping, as seen in Fig. 4(b). Indeed, the x=1.3\% sample exhibits reentrant behavior in which the low-temperature state becomes non-AFM below T_{\rm C} within experimental uncertainty. The temperature evolution of the magnetically ordered fraction F is shown in Fig. 4(a). F shows a sharp increase below T_{\rm N} while the onset of SC causes F to decrease when cooled below T_{\rm C}. With higher doping, a stronger reduction of F is observed below T_{\rm C}. For the x=1.3\% system, magnetic order is completely destroyed and the system loses long-range AFM order below 14 K. The evolution of magnetic and SC volume fractions across temperature and doping is presented in Fig. 5.

### Comparison with elastic neutron scattering

Muon spin rotation and neutron scattering are two powerful experimental techniques for studying magnetic materials. As described in Ref. [31], these methods have distinct features

[25; 26; 27].

  that make them complementary probes of magnetism. For instance, both techniques are sensitive to different time scales of dynamic fluctuations. However, since we are probing static magnetic order in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As, both \muSR and elastic neutron scattering should yield consistent results. In addition, as a volume-integrating probe in reciprocal space, neutron scattering is sensitive to both the ordered moment and its volume fraction, but these two contributions cannot be separated from the measured scattered intensity. However, \muSR enables independent measurements of both the volume fraction and the ordered moment size, unlike neutron scattering and other bulk probes.

As described in Sec. I, elastic neutron scattering experiments on NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As reveal that the neutron magnetic order parameter is diminished below T_{\rm C}[18], which was interpreted as the reduction of the magnetic moment below T_{\rm C}. However, the suppression of magnetic order below T_{\rm C} observed in neutron diffraction cannot be unambiguously attributed to a reduction of the magnetic moment, as pointed out in the previous paragraph. A comparison between the neutron magnetic order parameter and the magnetic strength \mathcal{M}^{2}F from our \muSR studies is shown in Fig. 6 for the x=1.0 and 1.3% systems. From our ZF-\muSR results in Fig. 4, we conclude that the suppression of magnetic ordering is due to a decrease in both the ordered volume fraction and the moment size.

### Discussion

Our results offer strong evidence that both the ordered moment and fraction are partially or fully suppressed below T_{\rm C}. The strong suppression of the magnetism below the onset of superconductivity was also observed in the "122" and "11" families of Fe-HTS: BaFe_{2-x}Co_{x}As_{2}[10, 11] (where reentrance of

However, we note that in BaFe_{2-x}Co_{x}As_{2} and Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}, only the ordered moment decreases below T_{\rm C}, but the magnetic fraction remains unaffected. Detailed studies of magnetism and superconductivity in the related system NaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}As were previously conducted [14]. In NaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}As, only the ordered moment was diminished below T_{\rm C}. This reduction is much smaller than that of NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. We also noticed that the observed muon precession frequencies in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As and NaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}As follow different patterns. We have found two high frequencies and one low frequency for NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As, while one high frequency and two low frequencies were reported for NaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}As. Although a definitive explanation for these differences requires further studies, it is clear that Ni and Co dopants perturb the electronic structure of NaFeAs in different ways.

Both the ordered moment and magnetic fraction decrease below T_{\rm C} for FeSe (which becomes magnetic under hydrostatic pressure). Results in the present investigation of NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As are similar to the FeSe case. Itinerant AFM and SC orders are generally expected to compete strongly for the same electronic states; this behavior can be captured within a simple Ginzburg-Landau free energy for the AFM and SC order parameters, \mathcal{M} and \Delta, respectively (in the context of Fe-HTS, see for instance Refs. [15,33,34,35]):

\[F=\frac{a_{m}}{2}\mathcal{M}^{2}+\frac{u_{m}}{4}\mathcal{M}^{4}+\frac{a_{s}}{ 2}\Delta^{2}+\frac{u_{s}}{4}\Delta^{4}+\frac{\gamma}{2}\mathcal{M}^{2}\Delta^ {2}\]

The degree of competition between these two orders is encoded in the combination of coefficients g=\gamma/\sqrt{u_{s}u_{m}}. If the

  competition is too strong (g>1), these two orders are macroscopically phase separated and do not coexist microscopically. On the other hand, if the competition is weak (g<1), they can establish a coexistence phase in which both order parameters are simultaneously nonzero at the same position. In a homogeneous system, the first scenario is manifested by a reduction of the AFM volume fraction F below T_{\text{C}} without a change in the size of the magnetic moment. Conversely, the second scenario is manifested by a reduction of the magnetic moment below T_{\text{C}} without any variation in the volume fraction. Interestingly, we observe both signatures in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. Although a detailed theoretical analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, this suggests that the parameter g itself may be inhomogeneous and change as a function of the position in the sample. If Cooper pairs were to form an unconventional sign-changing s^{\pm} state [36, 37], it was argued [15] that the system would be at the verge of phase separation and microscopic coexistence, i.e., g\approx 1. In this case, local inhomogeneity could locally alter the value of g in a significant manner [38].

## IV Internal field simulations at muon stopping sites

To investigate the effect of Ni dopants on the magnetism in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As, we numerically simulate the behavior of the muon in the magnetic environment of NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. In low-temperature \muSR experiments, the incident muons thermalize with the lattice and are implanted at interstitial locations referred to as stopping sites. Muon implantation sites in Fe-HTS have been successfully identified using a succession of increasingly accurate theoretical calculations. Early studies were based on the analysis of the local minima of the unperturbed electrostatic potential within either the simple Thomas Fermi or a full density functional theory (DFT) approach. This strategy was specifically followed for the "1111" [17, 39, 40, 41] and the "11" [32, 42] classes of Fe-HTS. In addition, similar calculations were performed on selected "122" [43, 44] materials and other systems [45, 46]. Recently, and exclusively for the "1111" family of Fe-HTS, the effect of the muon on the lattice was captured within a supercell DFT impurity calculation by considering force and energy relaxations of possible muon implantation sites [47, 48].

The _ab initio_ search often identifies clusters of sites. This is true also in the simple unperturbed potential method that fails in insulators such as fluorides [49] but yields a correct first approximation in the metallic pnictides owing to the electron screening of the muon charge. In this case, the clusters are defined as the portion of the unit cell volume enclosed by the isosurface corresponding to the muon ground state energy. More accurate stopping site determination would require an impurity DFT approach. Under this methodology, clusters of candidate muon sites are generally found with smaller _intracluster_ and larger _inter_cluster energy barriers.

Since muon localization is a metastable epithermal kinetic process that cannot be described by a mere minimum energy criterion, all of these methods uncover clusters of candidate locations that may not directly correspond to observed muon sites. In principle, the true muon fate could be simulated by robust _ab initio_ path integral molecular dynamics [50, 51]. At present, these techniques are computationally prohibitive for impurity calculations on complex structures such as Fe-HTS. Therefore, the most feasible method for muon site determination in Fe-HTS involves comparing the experimental and calculated local field values at candidate sites.

### Candidate muon stopping sites in "111" systems

To determine plausible muon implantation sites in the "111" family of Fe-HTS, we employed DFT methods that account for local crystal deformations and electronic band structure perturbations due to the implanted muons. In particular, muon stopping site calculations in NaFeAs and NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As were performed using spin-polarized DFT with plane wave expansions of the Kohn-Sham orbitals at both atomic and interstitial sites. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was applied for the exchange correlation functional within the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) formalism [52, 53]. Finally, the core wave function was approximated using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method [54]. The plane wave and charge density cutoffs were chosen to be 120 and 1080 Ry, respectively. More details on the muon site determination procedure are found in Appendices A and A 2.

This initial search with DFT methods uncovered five plausible muon sites in NaFeAs, which are also assumed to be valid for lowly doped NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. The five candidate sites were grouped into two clusters based on relative calculated energies. Since the muon is treated as a classical particle within DFT, corrections due to its light mass can be included by taking into account the spread of the muon wave function in the double Born-Oppenheimer (DBO) approximation method [45]. As described in Appendix A.2, we invoked the DBO approximation to examine the relative stability of the five candidate sites. From our stability checks, we concluded that only two of the three muon sites in the low-energy cluster proved to be stable. In addition, both muon sites in the high-energy cluster relax into each other, suggesting that the muon is likely delocalized between these two sites, which are also in close proximity to each other. As a result, we have determined three plausible muon stopping locations (two stopping sites and a delocalized high-energy stopping position) in NaFeAs, which are listed in Table 1.

### Dipolar internal field simulations on NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As

With the muon stopping sites determined, magnetic dipolar field simulations were performed by simulating the NaFeAs as an array of localized magnetic dipoles. The two dipolar contributions considered in the internal field simulation are localized electronic moments from AFM-ordered Fe atoms and random nuclear dipolar moments from all atoms. Nonmagnetic nickel impurities were randomly substituted into the Fe sites on the host NaFeAs lattice to generate NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. By performing a vector sum of the array of (static) electronic and random nuclear dipolar moments, the internal field distribution was numerically simulated for all points in the crystal.

To capture the stochastic fluctuations in the random nuclear moment directions and Ni site substitutions, the internal field distribution was simulated by performing 10 000 independent trials of dipolar sums for each muon site as a function of Ni concentration x. Although simulated results can be  implemented for any x, the simplified dipolar field model severely breaks down beyond x\gtrsim 0.4% since the simulation does not consider bulk superconductivity (see Fig. 1). Magnetic disorder induced by the SC state at x\gtrsim 0.4% could also explain the disappearance of coherent oscillations in the ZF-\muSR spectra in Fig. 2. Additional details on the simulation setup for exploring the local magnetic environment at the NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As stopping sites are found in Appendices A.1 and A.3.

### Discussion of computational results

The main results of our computational investigation are summarized in Table 1. Our stopping site calculations and stability analysis reveal three plausible muon stopping sites in NaFeAs. This is consistent with the observation that there are three precession frequencies in the ZF-\muSR spectra in lightly-doped NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. The calculated precession frequencies are listed in Table 1, along with the extrapolated frequencies from power law fits of the frequencies from \muSR found in Fig. 3(a). Moreover, our simulations show that the mean local fields at the two high-field sites make an acute angle of approximately 36^{\circ} with the crystal c axis, implying that the strong fields at these sites are preferentially aligned with the c axis. This is consistent with our experimental observation that the high frequency oscillations have noticeable amplitudes when the initial muon spin is not aligned with the c axis (i.e., in the spin-rotated configuration), as shown in Fig. 2(a). Differences in the simulated and experimentally-obtained angles \theta suggest that the true muon sites are likely a small displacement from the ones listed in Table 1.

The doping evolution of the simulated precession frequencies are shown in Fig. 3(c). Comparisons of the simulated and observed frequencies for Site 1 in our dipolar field simulations enabled us to estimate the ordered moment size of the Fe atoms in NaFeAs to be \mu_{\rm Fe}=0.175(3)\mu_{\rm B}. The difference between the simulated and experimental frequencies for the second and third sites suggests that quantum correlations (e.g., contact hyperfine fields) contribute to the internal field, which are not included in the dipolar model. In addition, the presence of Ni dopants can perturb the ordering of Fe moments, which was not included in the simulation. Nonetheless, our computational investigation provides a physical interpretation of the frequencies observed in the ZF-\muSR spectra and corroborates the model for the magnetic ordering in (1).

The ordered moment size in a variety of Fe-HTS has been explored experimentally using \muSR, neutron scattering, and Mossbauer measurements [55]. The reported variations of the ordered Fe moments of the same specimen is a testament to the differences in sensitivity across these three probes of the local moment. Table 2 shows a comparison of the ordered moment size of representative systems from the various classes of Fe-HTS. The estimate from our present investigation in NaFeAs, \mu_{\rm Fe}=0.175(3)\mu_{\rm B}, is consistent with the moment sizes reported from neutron scattering [56] and Mossbauer spectroscopy [57].

## V Linear relationship between ordered moment and T_{\rm N}

Despite the notable differences in the experimentally-measured ordered moment sizes across different Fe-HTS [55], there are some notable relationships between the ordered moment and other material parameters. The observation of a linear relationship between the muon precession frequency v and the magnetic ordering temperature T_{\rm N} was initially noted

Separate linear trends in "122" and "1111" classes of Fe-HTS were discovered from Mossbauer spectroscopy relating the internal hyperfine field and the orthorhombic lattice distortion [10]. The different proportionality constants between the two classes of Fe-HTS have been ascribed to the critical dynamics of the structural and magnetic transitions [66, 67]. In this section, we make use of muon stopping site calculations to extend the investigation of the linear trend between the ordered moment size and T_{\rm N} from \muSR results.

### Linear trends from \muSR results

Figure 7 depicts the correlation between the low temperature precession frequency v(T\to 0) and the ordering temperature T_{\rm N} for a variety of Fe-HTS, including NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As from the present investigation. Note that for the SC samples, the values of the precession frequencies, extrapolated to T=0 from above T_{c} are taken. Since the precession frequency v is proportional to the local magnetic field at the muon site, v is proportional to the ordered moment size, and therefore the magnetization. v also depends on the distance between the muon stopping site and the dominant ordered moment (Fe atoms). Remarkably, despite the differences in chemical composition and crystal structure across the various main families of Fe-HTS, (which influence the number and location of the muon stopping sites) a linear trend between v(T\to 0) and T_{\rm N} appears to persist. This suggests that the mechanism responsible for driving the magnetic ordering may be similar across different crystal structures and dopant atoms. Under this linear scaling relationship, there is an increase of 0.244(3) MHz/K between the v(T\to 0) and T_{\rm N}.

Since muon stopping sites have been calculated for a variety of Fe-HTS, we can compare the ordered Fe moment sizes directly. The ordered magnetic moment on the Fe atom can be calculated as the scaling factor necessary for matching the precession frequencies from dipolar field simulations against experimental results. Shown in Fig. 8 is a comparison between the ordered magnetic moment of the Fe atoms and T_{\rm N}. A linear model was fit to the data, revealing that the magnetic moment \mu_{\rm Fe} scales with T_{\rm N} as 0.0062(6) \mu_{\rm B}/{\rm K} across these families of Fe-HTS.

### Discussion

The universal linear relationship between the T\!=\!0 sublattice magnetization M and the experimentally observed T_{\rm N} provides important insight into the nature of the magnetic state. Within an itinerant mean-field approach, in which AFM is driven by Fermi surface nesting, M\propto T_{\rm N} follows naturally whenever the Fermi surfaces are perfectly nested; this is the same relationship between the SC gap function and T_{\rm C} that appears in BCS theory. Since the Fermi pockets of the iron pnictides are not perfectly nested, it is important to verify whether M\propto T_{\rm N} applies more generally in itinerant antiferromagnets. To investigate this issue, we consider a widely studied toy model consisting of one circular hole pocket located at the center of the Brillouin zone and one elliptical electron pocket shifted from the center by the AFM ordering vector [15, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 74]. The mismatch between the Fermi pockets is tuned by two parameters: \delta_{2}, which characterizes the ellipticity of the electron pocket, and \delta_{0}, which describes the difference between the areas of the Fermi pockets (and is therefore indirectly

  related to doping). The case \delta_{0}=\delta_{2}=0 corresponds to perfect nesting, giving T_{\rm N,0}=(\frac{c^{2}}{T})M_{0}\approx 0.567M_{0}.

Following Refs. [15, 33, 34], we compute not only T_{\rm N} as a function of the parameters \delta_{0} and \delta_{2}, but also the magnetization M at T=0. We focus on the regime in which the AFM transition is second order (see Appendix B for details). As shown in Fig. 9, M monotonically increases with increasing T_{\rm N}. Each curve corresponds to a fixed value of \delta_{2} and continuously changing values of \delta_{0}. Interestingly, when \delta_{2} is not too large, T_{\rm N} and M follow a nearly linear relationship over a wide parameter range, which is consistent with previous works [15, 33]. Although a quantitative comparison with experimental findings must account for band structure details of different compounds, the results of this simple model are qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations, suggesting that nesting plays an important role in driving the AFM instability.

## VI Superconductivity in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As

\muSR experiments performed with an applied field transverse to the initial muon ensemble spin, called TF-\muSR, allow determination of the magnetic field penetration depth \lambda, which is one of the fundamental parameters of a superconductor [16]. (Recall that \lambda is related to the superconducting carrier density n_{s} through \lambda^{-2}=\mu_{0}e^{2}n_{s}/m^{*}, where m^{*} is the effective mass and \mu_{0} is the vacuum permeability). Most importantly, the temperature dependence of \lambda is particularly sensitive to the presence of SC nodes. In a fully gapped superconductor, \Delta\lambda^{-2}(T)\equiv\lambda^{-2}(0)-\lambda^{-2}(T) vanishes exponentially at low T and decays as a power of T in a nodal SC. As a result, the \muSR technique is a powerful tool to measure \lambda in type II superconductors. Specifically, \muSR experiments in the vortex state of a type II superconductor allow the determination of \lambda in the bulk of the sample, in contrast to many techniques that probe \lambda only near the surface.

To understand the temperature evolution of \lambda, it is informative to study the symmetry and structure of the SC gap. Significant experimental and theoretical efforts have focused on this issue in Fe-HTS [1, 2]. However, there is no consensus on a universal gap structure and the relevance for the particular gap symmetry for Fe-HTS, which are the first noncuprate materials exhibiting superconductivity at relatively high temperatures.

In contrast to cuprates, where the SC gap symmetry is universal, the gap symmetry and/or structure of the Fe-HTS varies across different systems. For instance, nodeless isotropic gap distributions were observed in optimally doped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}[75, 76], Ba_{1-x}Rb_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}[29], and BaFe_{2-x}Ni_{x}As_{2}[77] as well as in BaFe_{2-x}Co_{x}As_{2}[78], K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}[79], and FeTe_{1-x}Se_{x}[80, 81]. Signatures of nodal SC gaps were reported in LaFePO [82], LiFeP [83], KFe_{2}As_{2}[84], BaFe2(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2}[85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 86, 87, 88], BaFe_{2-x}Ru_{x}As_{2}[89], and FeSe [90] as well as in overdoped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}[91] and in optimally doped Ba_{1-x}Rb_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} under pressure [92]. Therefore, it is fruitful to extend the study of the SC gap symmetry to other Fe-based materials, specifically the "111" family of Fe-HTS. In this section, we present and discuss TF-\muSR results on the x=1.3\% sample in the superconducting state.

### TF-\muSR results

Shown in Fig. 10 are the TF-\muSR time spectra on the x=1.3\% system, measured in an applied field of 300 Oe above (40 K) and below (2 K) T_{\rm C}\approx 15 K. Above T_{\rm C}, the oscillations show a small relaxation due to random local fields from nuclear magnetic moments. As the sample is field cooled below T_{\rm C}, the relaxation steadily increases due to the presence of a nonuniform local field distribution as a result of the formation of a flux-line lattice (FLL) in the SC state. The TF-\muSR spectra were analyzed using the following functional form:

\[P_{\rm TF}(t) = F_{\rm nm}\cos(2\pi\,vt+\phi)\] (2) \[\times\,\exp\,\{-\frac{1}{2}\big{(}\sigma_{\rm nm}^{2}+\sigma_{ \rm SC}^{2}\big{)}t^{2}\big{]}e^{-\lambda_{\rm Mott}t}.\]

The defining parameters in (2) are the precession frequency v, the relaxation rates \sigma_{\rm SC} and \sigma_{\rm nm} characterizing the damping due to the formation of FLL in the SC state and the nuclear magnetic dipolar contribution, respectively, and an exponential relaxation rate for field-induced magnetism \lambda_{\rm Mag}[93]. The model in (2) has been previously used [29, 94] for Fe-HTS in the presence of dilute or fast fluctuating electronic moments

Figure 9: Theoretical calculations of the ordered moment M at T=0 versus the AFM critical temperature T_{\rm N}. The ellipticity of the electron band, given by \delta_{2}, is fixed for each curve, whereas the parameter \delta_{0}, corresponding to doping, is varied continuously. M_{0} is the AFM moment M at T=0 when the hole and electron Fermi pockets are perfectly nested.

  and it was demonstrated to be sufficiently precise for extracting the SC depolarization rate as a function of temperature.

The temperature dependence of v shows a PM shift below T_{\rm C} in Fig. 11(a), which is different from the expected diamagnetic shift imposed by the SC state [29, 94, 95]. It is difficult to elucidate the origin of the PM shift, however the effects are consistent with field-induced magnetism. Other phenomena such as vortex lattice disorder [93] or a Yosida-like decrease of the spin susceptibility [96] may also contribute to this behavior and can be investigated further.

The SC and magnetic relaxation rates, \sigma_{\rm SC} and \lambda_{\rm Mgg}, respectively, are shown in Figs. 11(b) and 11(c), demonstrating an additional effect of a weak contribution of static magnetism to the SC state. We also observe the nonmonotonic temperature dependence of \lambda_{\rm Mgg}, which may be caused by the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity [15, 97]. As the sample is cooled in an external transverse field below T_{\rm C}\approx 15 K, \sigma_{\rm SC} begins to rise from 0 due to the FLL formation. \sigma_{\rm SC} saturates upon further cooling, which resembles the behavior of an isotropic nodeless superconductor.

We found that an isotropic two-band (s+s)-wave SC model describes the temperature dependence of the measured \sigma_{\rm SC} remarkably well [see Figure 11(b)], yielding a large gap \Delta_{1}\simeq 4.5(6) meV and a small gap \Delta_{2}\simeq 1.8(5) meV. Refer to Appendix C for details on the SC gap symmetry analysis. A two-gap scenario is also consistent with the generally accepted view of multigap superconductivity in Fe-HTS [1, 36]. The magnitudes of the large 2\Delta_{1}/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm C}\simeq 6.9(5) and the small 2\Delta_{2}/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm C}\simeq 2.8(5) gap for NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As (x=0.013) are in good agreement with previous work [98]. There it was pointed out that most Fe-HTS exhibit a two-gap SC behavior, characterized by a large gap with magnitude 2\Delta/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm C}\simeq 7(2) and a small gap with 2.5(1.5).

### Connection with other unconventional superconductors

An interesting result of \muSR investigations in Fe-HTS is the observed proportionality between T_{\rm c} and the zero-temperature relaxation rate \sigma(0)\propto\lambda^{-2}(0), known as the Uemura plot [100, 101]. This relation, which seems to be generic for various families of cuprate HTS, has the features that upon increasing the charge carrier doping T_{\rm c} first increases linearly in the underdoped region (blue line in Fig. 12), then saturates, and finally is suppressed for high carrier doping. The initial linear trend of the Uemura relation indicates that for these unconventional HTS, the ratio T_{\rm C}/E_{\rm F} (E_{\rm F} is the Fermi energy)

(b).(c) Temperature dependences of the relaxation rates ascribed to the SC and magnetic orders, respectively. The solid line in (b) represents an isotropic two-band SC model fit to the temperature evolution of \sigma_{\rm SC}. The peak in \lambda_{\rm Mgg} in (c) is close to T_{\rm C}, indicating that the onset of SC order affects the dilute electronic moment distribution.

The linear relation observed for underdoped cuprates is shown as a blue colored solid line for hole doping [100, 101] and as a red colored dashed line for electron doped systems [102]. The points for conventional BCS superconductors are also shown. The orange star marker shows the data point for NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As obtained in this work.

  is much larger than that of conventional BCS superconductors. Figure 12 shows T_{\rm C} plotted against \lambda^{-2}(0) for various hole- and electron-doped Fe-HTS (see Ref. [99] and references therein), including the current results on NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. The linear relation observed for underdoped cuprates is also shown as a solid line for hole doped cuprates [100, 101] and as a dashed line for electron doped cuprates [102]. The present data for NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As in the Uemura plot is in close proximity to the line observed in hole-doped cuprates and other Fe-HTS. This connection contrasts with LiFeAs, which shows behavior following electron-doped cuprates. The observation of a reduced superfluid stiffness in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As compared to LiFeAs presents a new challenge for theoretical explanations.

## VII VII. Conclusion

In conclusion, the magnetic and SC properties of NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As were studied as a function of Ni-content x by DC magnetization and \muSR techniques. The long range magnetic order is observed for x=0 and 0.4% samples, while for x>0.4% magnetic order becomes inhomogeneous and is completely suppressed for x=1.5%. The magnetic volume fraction continuously decreases with increasing x. Furthermore, superconductivity acquires its full volume for samples with x\gtrsim 0.4%. This implies that there is a coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. Both the ordered moment and the magnetic volume fraction decrease below T_{\rm C}, showing that magnetism, which develops at higher temperatures, becomes partially (or even fully) suppressed by the onset of superconductivity. These results indicate that the competition between the SC and magnetic order parameters in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As develop in an intrinsically inhomogeneous environment, providing important insight for theoretical modeling. A linear relationship between the T=0 ordered moment and the AFM ordering temperature T_{\rm N} for various Fe-HTS is noted, which is consistent with a mean-field approach for itinerant electrons, in which antiferromagnetism is driven by Fermi surface nesting. From TF-\muSR measurements, the temperature evolution of the penetration depth in NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As is consistent with an isotropic two-gap (s+s)-wave model for superconductivity.

## Appendix A Internal Field Simulation

### Initialization of Crystal Properties

At low temperatures, NaFeAs crystallizes into the Cmme space group, with the following assumed lattice constants for the orthorhombic structure based on Ref. [19]: a=5.6834 A, b=5.6223 A, and c=6.9063 A. Stopping site calculations and subsequent dipolar field calculations were performed on NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As with the atomic properties displayed in Table 3. The sample was assumed to be in the low temperature ordered state with Fe spins aligned in the usual collinear AFM arrangement as depicted in Fig. 1(d).

### Muon Stopping Site Determination

The search for muon sites was initiated by sampling a 4\times 4\times 4 grid of possible interstitial positions in the NaFeAs lattice that are at least 1 A away from lattice atoms. Symmetry-equivalent points in the search grid were removed with the space group symmetry of the lattice. The stability of a H atom in a 2\times 2\times 2 supercell consisting of 96 Na-Fe-As atoms was examined at each point in the grid. A 2\times 2\times 2 Monkhorst-Pack grid of \vec{k} points was used for Brillouin zone sampling. DFT calculations were carried out assuming the usual collinear magnetic ordering of Fe atoms in NaFeAs

\begin{table}

\end{table}
Table 3: Summary of crystal parameters for low-temperature simulations of NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As.

  as shown in Fig. 1(d) [19]. To accommodate for structural relaxations, the forces were optimized till a threshold of 10^{-3} atomic units and the energies till a threshold of 10^{-4} atomic units. Table 4 lists five candidate muon sites for NaFeAs using this first-order search procedure. These sites are also assumed to be compatible for lowly doped NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As.

We group the five candidate sites into two clusters based on stability checks using the double Born-Oppenheimer approximation method (DBO) [45], which takes into account the quantum description of the muon. Within this method, a potential exploration algorithm (PEA) is used to efficiently sample the _a priori_ unknown potential felt by the muon. With the sampling of the potential, site C is observed to be a local minimum in the muon potential. Site C relaxes towards sites A and B since site C has very low barrier less than 0.24 eV that is too small to bind the muon. Sites A and B are also close in proximity to each other and in energy difference. Consequently, we associate sites A, B, and C together as cluster I. Similarly, we also observe that sites E and D relax into each other, which together form cluster II. Our clustering also explains the observed frequencies--cluster I contains the low DFT energy sites that describe the high muon field observed from experiment, while cluster II contains sites that correspond to the low field.

Shown in Fig. 13 are the results of further analysis of the sites in cluster II. The energy profile extracted from the DBO potential map can be represented by the toy model shown in Fig. 13. This enables us to solve the Schrodinger equation of the muon, yielding a ground state energy of 0.17 eV (independent of the interpolation method and the boundary condition, to some extent) which is greater than the barrier seen in the potential map. These findings suggest that the muon wave function for the low field sites may be delocalized over positions between sites D and E (hereafter the D-E site). As a result, the low frequency detected from experiments may come from an averaging of the field at the two sites. Following analysis considering the quantum nature of the muon due to its light mass, we propose that sites A, B, and D-E are the possible implantation sites of the muon.

DBO would still predict a zero average at the D-E sites probed by the muon wave function due to the symmetry of the sites in the lattice. However a DFT mapping of the total energy and a separate solution of the muon Schrodinger equation may not give the final answer, since the muon quantum nature is ignored in the DFT assessment of the total energy. The actual muon site may still be slightly distorting the local environment, thus justifying the small but nonvanishing low precession frequency listed in Table 4.

## 3 Low Temperature Dipolar Field Simulation

A 9\times 9\times 9 supercell of magnetic dipoles was used to model the internal field of NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As. Dipole positions and strengths for the idealized crystal structure in NaFeAs listed in Table 3. Nuclear dipole moment directions are assumed to be random for all atoms while the spins on Fe are assumed to take on a collinear AFM striped pattern, common to other Fe-HTS. To simulate the effect of doping, the magnetic Fe atoms are randomly substituted with nonmagnetic Ni atoms to achieve the desired Ni concentration x. The dipolar field at the muon site was obtained by summing over all dipoles in the NaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}As supercell.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c} Cluster & Label & Symmetry & Site Positiona  & \Delta E (meV)b  & Field \overline{|B|} (G)c  & Frequency v (MHz)d  & Angle \theta (c)f  \\ \hline I & A & 8n & (0.100, 0.750, 0.100) & 0 & 578.5(2.1) & 7.839(30) & 42.1(5) \\ I & B & 8m & (0.000, 0.875, 0.100) & 42 & 810.9(3.5) & 10.987(49) & 31.1(6) \\ I & C & 8l & (0.250, 0.500, 0.250) & 183 & 488.3(4.1) & 6.616(56) & 88.6(4) \\ II & D & 4b & (0.750, 0.500, 0.500) & 287 & 1.002(69) & 0.014(40) & 0.2(3) \\ II & E  By comparing the simulated frequencies, shown in Table 4, with the experimental results, we can associate the two high frequencies v_{1} and v_{2} with sites B and A, respectively. The low frequency v_{3} corresponds best with site E of cluster II. However, our stability analysis shows that the muon is likely delocalized over sites D and E. A comparison between simulated and experimental results is presented in Table 1. Our simulations show that the experimentally observed frequency v_{1}=10.9 MHz in NaFeAs corresponds to an ordered Fe moment size of about \mu_{\rm Fe}=0.175(3)\mu_{\rm B}.

## Appendix B Ordered moment scaling calculations

In this section, we present a description of the two-band model discussed in Sec. V and introduced in Refs. [33, 34]. The effective free energy density of the model can be written as

\[f=\frac{2\mathcal{M}^{2}}{I}-\frac{T}{\upsilon}\sum_{\alpha_{\rm t}}\sum_{ \bm{k}}\ln\big{[}\big{(}\omega_{n}^{2}+E_{+,\bm{k}}^{2}\big{)}\big{(}\omega_{n }^{2}+E_{-,\bm{k}}^{2}\big{)}\big{]},\] (21)

where \mathcal{M} is the temperature dependent ordered AFM moment, I>0 is the AFM interaction coupling constant, \omega_{n}=2\pi T(n+1/2) is a fermionic Matsubara frequency (n\in\mathbb{Z}), \upsilon is the volume of the system, and

\[E_{\pm,\bm{k}}=\sqrt{\mathcal{M}^{2}+\xi_{k}^{2}}\pm|\delta_{0}|.\]

Here, \xi_{k}=k^{2}/2m-\epsilon_{0} is a parabolic energy dispersion, \theta is the angle in the Fermi surface between the momentum \bm{k} and the x axis, and \delta_{0}\equiv\delta_{0}+\delta_{2}\cos(2\theta) describes deviations from the perfect nesting condition.

The momentum sum can be evaluated as \frac{1}{\upsilon}\sum_{\bm{k}}\rightarrow\frac{m}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty }\mathrm{d}\xi\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{d\theta}{2\pi}. We minimize f in (21) with respect to \mathcal{M} and perform the \mathrm{d}\xi integration to obtain

\[\frac{\mathcal{M}}{mI}=T\sum_{0<\omega_{n}<\Lambda}\int\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta} {2\pi}\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}\frac{\mathcal{M}}{\sqrt{\mathcal{M}^{2}+(\omega_{n }+i|\delta_{0}|)^{2}}},\] (22)

where \Lambda is a high-frequency cutoff. At T=0, we integrated over frequencies to obtain

\[\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}\int\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{2\pi}\ln\bigg{(}i|\delta_{0}| +\sqrt{M^{2}-\delta_{0}^{2}}\bigg{)}=\ln M_{0},\] (23)

where M\equiv\mathcal{M}(T=0) and M_{0}\equiv 2\Lambda e^{-2\pi/mI} is the value of M for \delta_{0}=0=\delta_{2}.

When the transition is second order, T_{\rm N} is the temperature at which \mathcal{M}(T\to T_{\rm N})\to 0. Setting \mathcal{M}=0 in (22) and performing the Matsubara sum yields

\[2\ln\bigg{(}\frac{4\pi\,T_{\rm N}}{M_{0}}\bigg{)}+\int\frac{ \mathrm{d}\theta}{2\pi}\bigg{[}\psi\bigg{(}\frac{1}{2}+\frac{i\delta_{0}}{2\pi \,T_{\rm N}}\bigg{)}\] \[\quad+\psi\bigg{(}\frac{1}{2}-\frac{i\delta_{0}}{2\pi\,T_{\rm N} }\bigg{)}\bigg{]}=0,\] (24)

where \psi(z)\equiv\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z}\ln\Gamma(z) is the digamma function.

We have numerically calculated the remaining angular integral in the self-consistent equations (23) and (24) to determine the behavior of M and T_{\rm N} as functions of \delta_{0} and \delta_{2}. For fixed \delta_{2}, the transition is second order at small \delta_{0} but becomes first order at larger \delta_{0}. Moreover, there is no ordered AFM state [34] for \delta_{2}>M_{0}. On the other hand, the ordered magnetic moment at T=0 generally increases with decreasing \delta_{0} and \delta_{2} and abruptly saturates at \delta_{0}+\delta_{2}=M_{0}. These results are presented in Fig. 14. More importantly, these results enable us to plot and examine the behavior of the ordered moment at T=0 vs T_{\rm N}, which is shown in Fig. 9.

## Appendix C Tf-\muSr SC gap analysis

To explore the SC gap symmetry, we recall that the penetration depth \lambda(T) (in an isotropic superconductor) is related to the quadratic relaxation rate \sigma_{\rm SC}(T) through \sigma_{\rm SC}(T)=k\gamma_{\mu}\Phi_{0}\lambda^{-2}(T), where \gamma_{\mu} is the muon gyromagnetic ratio, \Phi_{0}\equiv\frac{1}{2\sigma} is the quantum of magnetic flux, and k\approx 0.06091 is a geometric factor characterizing the FLL [25, 103]. The temperature evolution of \lambda(T) can be modeled for a variety of SC gap symmetries and structures.

Within the local London limit of electrodynamics (where the penetration depth \lambda is much greater than the SC coherence length \xi), the \alpha model is a popular phenomenological

Figure 14: Summary of numerical results for the ordered moment M and T_{\rm N}. (a) Ordered moment M at T=0 and (b) T_{\rm N} as functions of the area difference parameter \delta_{0} for fixed values of the ellipticity parameter \delta_{2}. Results are shown in the regime where the transition is second order. Colors represent different values of \delta_{2}/M_{0} listed in Fig. 9.

  framework used to study multiband superconductivity [104; 105; 106]. The \alpha model assumes that the SC gaps in different bands are independent from each other (aside from sharing a common T_{\text{C}}) and that the normalized penetration depth \frac{\lambda(T)}{\lambda(0)} follows the same temperature dependence as in the single-band clean-limit BCS theory. A two-band \alpha model in which the superfluid densities from each band are added together was used to analyze the TF-\muSR results:

\[\frac{\sigma_{\text{SC}}(T)}{\sigma_{\text{SC}}(0)}=\sum_{j=1}^{2}f_{j}\frac{ \lambda^{-2}(T,\tilde{\Delta}_{j})}{\lambda^{-2}(0,\tilde{\Delta}_{j})},\] (10)

where \tilde{\Delta}_{j} is the maximum value of the SC gap at T=0 for each band (j=1,2). The relative contributions from each band are imposed through the constraint \sum_{j=1}^{2}f_{j}=1 in (10).

Assuming that the Fermi velocity is constant in magnitude, the penetration depth is determined through the integral expression [107]:

\[\frac{\lambda^{-2}(T,\tilde{\Delta}_{j})}{\lambda^{-2}(0,\tilde{ \Delta}_{j})} =1+\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\text{d}\varphi\int_{\tilde{\Delta }_{j}}^{\infty}E\,\text{d}E\times\cdots\] \[\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial E}\right)\frac{1}{\sqrt{E^{2}- \Delta_{j}^{2}(T,\varphi)}},\] (11)

where f(E)\equiv[1+\exp(E/k_{\text{B}}T)]^{-1} is the Fermi function. The SC gap functions \Delta_{j}(T,\varphi) in (11) are assumed to have the separable form: \Delta_{j}(T,\varphi)=\tilde{\Delta}_{j}g(\frac{T}{\varepsilon})S(\varphi). The temperature dependence of the gap is approximated by the function g(t)=\tanh[\alpha(\beta(t^{-1}-1)^{y})], with \alpha=1.82, \beta=1.018, and \delta=0.51[107]. The SC gap symmetry is embedded in S(\varphi), which is defined to be 1 for s-wave and (s+s)-wave gaps and |\cos(2\psi)| for d-wave gaps. The results of applying (10) to the x=1.3% system are shown in Fig. 11(b), demonstrating that the two-band \alpha model with an (s+s)-wave SC gap is a feasible model for the data.

* (108) Recently, the authors of Ref. [18] updated their report based on information obtained in their new neutron studies on additional specimens. The authors now show the neutron results on the identical crystal denoted by Ni 0.013 in the present paper using a new effective Ni concentration of x=0.012. In the present paper, we use the original nominal concentration x=0.013 for this crystal.
