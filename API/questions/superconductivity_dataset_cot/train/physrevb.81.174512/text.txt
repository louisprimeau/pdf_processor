\({}^{2}\)March 2009200 ground, pelletized, and sintered at 1173 K for 5 h. All weighing operations and loading of the reactants into the Ta crucibles were done in a helium-filled glove box. The FeAs and RuAs powders were prepared in the same setup by heat texting the intimate mixtures of Fe and As powders in quartz crucibles in the temperature range of 873-1073 K for 6 h. The procedure was repeated twice with an intermediate grinding. The samples were characterized for phase formation and crystal structure using a STOE diffractometer operating in the Bragg-Brentano geometry. The resistivity measurements, carried out in the four-probe geometry, were done in a dipper cryostat. The diamagnetism of the samples was confirmed by magnetization measurements in a CRYOGENIC, U.K. make liquid-helium-based vibrating sample magnetometer operating at 20.4 Hz. HC\({}_{2}\) and the Hall-coefficient measurements were carried out in an exchange gas cryostat in the 6-300 K temperature range under magnetic fields up to 12 T. \({}^{57}\)Fe Mossbauer measurements were carried out in transmission mode with \({}^{57}\)Co radioactive source in constant acceleration mode using a standard personal computer based Mossbauer spectrometer equipped with a Weissel make velocity drive. The measurements were carried out at 300 and 5 K, and 5 T external magnetic field applied parallel to the gamma rays (using JANIS Super-OptiMag superconducting magnet). Velocity calibration of the spectrometer was done with natural iron absorber at room temperature.

## III III. Results and discussions

The x-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicate the formation of the _14_/_mmm_, ThCr\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\) structure for all Ru fractions substituted. A small fraction of impurity peaks due to Ru/Fe and Ba arsenides were identified. From Rietveld analysis of the XRD data obtained for the _x_=0.875 sample, the fractional \(z\) coordinate of arsenic (\(Z_{\rm As}\)), transition-metal As bond length and the two (\(e_{1,2}\)) tetrahedral angles of FeAs\({}_{4}\) tetrahedron were determined to be 0.3554 nm, 0.2424 nm and 112.51\({}^{\circ}\), 107.97\({}^{\circ}\), respectively. The refined Ru composition was determined to be 0.864, which is close to the nominal composition. The tetrahedral angles are similar to those obtained in the case of isoelectronic substitution of P at As site for the optimal superconducting composition [16] but different from those seen under the application of pressure. [24]

The lattice-parameter variations obtained from XRD data as a function Ru concentration are shown in Fig. 1. It is clear from the figure that with Ru substitution there is an increase in the _a_-lattice parameter whereas the _c_-lattice parameter shows a decrease, leading to a decrease in the _c_/_a_ ratio. There is an overall increase in the cell volume of \(\sim\)1.18% for _x_=1.0. Similar changes were observed in the SrFe\({}_{2-\rm Ru}\)As\({}_{2}\) system. [25] The changes in the cell parameters due to Ru substitution contrasts with the variations obtained in Co- and P-substituted BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) and that under the application of pressure, [16; 24; 26] where a monotonic decrease in cell volume arises as a consequence of a decrease in both the _a_- and _c_-lattice parameters. In the Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K,Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) system, while the _a_-lattice parameter decreases and _c_-lattice parameter increases, the cell volume remains constant with substitution. [27]

The temperature dependence of resistivity normalized to the room-temperature value obtained in all Ru-substituted samples is shown in various panels in Fig. 2. The well-known drop in resistivity corresponding to the SDW transition [1] seen in BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) is clearly visible at \(\sim\)150 K in the _x_=0.0 sample. With increasing Ru substitution, for \(x\) =0.25, 0.50, and 0.625, the room-temperature resistivity decreases and the SDW transition shifts to a lower temperature. The onset of the SDW transition for the different Ru compositions are marked by " " in the figure. For a Ru fraction of _x_=0.75, a small bump due to the SDW transition is seen. In addition, the resistivity in this sample shows a clear signature of the occurrence of a superconducting transition with an onset of 22 K, leading to zero resistance. This transition to the superconducting state is clearly seen in samples with Ru fraction of _x_=0.875, 1.0, and 1.125 but the anomaly due to SDW transition is not observed in them. The normal-state resistance in these superconducting samples indicates a linear \(T\) dependence up to 250 K. Further for the _x_=0.625 and 1.25 samples, although a fall in \(R(T)/R(300\ \ {\rm K})\) is observed, no zero resistance is seen, and in the sample with _x_=1.5, no drop in resistivity is observed. It can be seen from the figure

  that the normal-state resistivity acquires curvature for \(x\) = 1.25 and 1.5 samples. For these samples, the \(R(T)\) in the normal state was seen to fit to a \(T^{n}\) power law with \(n\sim\) 1.5. Similar composition-dependent changes in the power-law behavior of the normal-state \(R(T)\) were seen in the BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2-x}\)P\({}_{x}\) system [16] and under the application of pressure. [10] The zero-field-cooled magnetization data of the four samples with Ru fraction \(x\)=0.75\(-\)1.125 sample is shown in Fig. 3. The diamagnetic drop at \(\sim\)20 K is evident from the data for samples with \(x\) in the range of \(x\) =0.75\(-\)1.125. No diamagnetic signals were observed for samples with \(x\)=0.625 and 1.25. The presence of zero resistance (Fig. 2) and diamagnetism (Fig. 3) in the samples with Ru composition in the composition range of \(x\)=0.75\(-\)1.125 provides unambiguous evidence for observance of superconductivity in the BaFe\({}_{2-x}\)Ru\({}_{x}\)As\({}_{2}\) system in this composition regime.

The variation in resistivity with temperature for the sample with a Ru fraction of \(x\)=0.875, measured under various fields upto 12 T is shown in Fig. 4. A systematic decrease in the superconducting onset with increasing magnetic field is clearly seen. Broadening of the superconducting transitions upon the application of magnetic field is negligible indicating the minor role of anisotropy and granularity in this system. This behavior is similar to the results that are obtained for the superconducting Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) and BaFe\({}_{2-x}\)Co\({}_{x}\)As\({}_{2}\) compounds. [23, 26] A linear fit to the onset data resulted in the evaluation of \(-dH_{\rm C2}/dT\) at \(T_{\rm C}\) to be 2 T/K. This value is close to that obtained for Co substitution in Ba(Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Co\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) for \(x\)=0.034 and 0.07 (Ref. [26]) but is substantially smaller than the value of \(\sim\)7 T /K (Ref. [23]) seen in K-substituted samples having a \(T_{\rm C}\) of 38 K. The variation in the critical field versus normalized \(T_{\rm C}\) [\(T_{\rm C}(B)/T_{\rm C}(0)\)] are compared for the three superconducting samples with varying Ru compositions in the inset of Fig. 4.

In Fig. 5, we summarize the variation in \(T_{\rm SDW}\) and \(T_{\rm C}\) obtained from the resistivity curves shown Fig. 2, as a function of Ru concentration. Data for samples that exhibit zero resistivity are only included in this figure. The superconducting onsets obtained from magnetization (Fig. 3) are also shown in the figure. It is evident from the figure that the SDW transition temperature decreases from that in the pristine compound for Ru fractions up to \(x\)=0.75. Coexistence of SDW and SC seems to occur in the \(x\)=0.75 sample. It is clear from Fig. 5 that for Ru fractions of \(x\)=0.875, 1.0, and 1.125, only the superconducting phase is stabilized. Superconductivity is absent for Ru concentration greater than or equal to \(x\)=1.25.

To investigate how Ru substitution affects the electronic structure, we have performed spin-polarized density-functional calculations for BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), BaFe\({}_{1.5}\)Ru\({}_{0.5}\)As\({}_{2}\), BaFe\({}_{1.0}\)Ru\({}_{1.0}\)As\({}_{2}\), BaFe\({}_{0.50}\)Ru\({}_{1.5}\)As\({}_{2}\), and BaRu\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), using the full-potential linearized plane wave plus localized orbitals method, with the wren2K code [27] and the results are shown in Fig. 6. The details of the calculation are elaborated in Ref. [28]. The calculations were carried out using a superstructure, obtained by the \(\langle 2\times\)\(\langle 2\times\)1 construction from the ground-state-relaxed crystal structure of BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) already published in literature, [29, 30] as shown in Fig. 6(c) [**a\({}^{\prime}\)**=(**a\(+\)b**), **b\({}^{\prime}\)**=(**a\(-\)b**), **c\({}^{\prime}\)**=**c\({}^{\prime}\)**=**c\({}^{\prime}\)**; **a**, **a\({}^{\prime}\)**, etc., are the real-space lattice vectors of the original and the transformed structures, respectively]. In this reconstructed structure, all the four Fe atoms occupy non-equivalent sites. The experimental lattice parameters of the

  Ru fraction of \(x\) = 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 were used for the Ru-substituted electronic-structure calculations. The calculated density of states (DOS), shown in Fig. 6(a) for BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), is in agreement with that obtained earlier.[29] The atom-resolved DOS for \(d\) Fe and \(p\) As are also indicated in the figure. The Ba atom does not contribute appreciably to the DOS near the Fermi level (\(E_{\rm F}\)). A steady increase in DOS at \(E_{\rm F}\) was seen with increase Ru substitution. This is clear from Fig. 6(b), where with 50% Ru substitution, the DOS at \(E_{\rm F}\) increases to 4.40 eV/unit cell/atom from 1.82 eV/unitcell/atom in the BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) [Fig. 6(a)], implying a change in the local hybridization characteristics as Ru is isovalent to Fe in this system. A similar increase in DOS at \(E_{\rm F}\) has been observed for the BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) system under the application of pressure and with K doping.[24] The significant broadening and their increased contribution to DOS suggests that the Fe 3\(d\) electrons get delocalized with Ru substitution. Ru \(d\) levels also contribute to a small extent to the DOS at \(E_{\rm F}\). The converged \(E_{\rm F}\) for BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) is 0.60268 Ry while that for BaFe\({}_{1.5}\)Ru\({}_{0.5}\)As\({}_{2}\) is 0.63645 Ry. Thus the upward shift in \(E_{\rm F}\) with increasing Ru content implies an electron doping due to Ru substitution.

To check on the nature of carriers introduced due to Ru substitution, Hall-coefficient measurements were carried out in the 10-300 K temperature range in a home built setup in the van der Pauw geometry.[31] The \(R_{\rm H}\) versus \(T\) for the single-crystalline sample of BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) and the \(R_{\rm H}\) versus temperature on the polycrystalline BaFe\({}_{2-}\),Ru\({}_{x}\)As\({}_{2}\) for the nominal x=0.75 sample are displayed Figs. 7(a) and 7(b), respec

  tively. Both the magnitude and temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient shown in Fig. 7(a) are in agreement with earlier reports on single crystals [32] of BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\). From Fig. 7(b), it is clear that the \(R_{\rm H}\) is negative in the normal state of the superconducting, Ru-substituted sample. The \(R_{\rm H}\) values also show the characteristic drop to zero due to occurrence of superconductivity below \(\sim\)20 K. The \(R_{\rm H}\) value in the normal state of the Ru-substituted sample shown in Fig. 7(b) is smaller than that seen in Ba\({}_{0.65}\)K\({}_{0.45}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) and that in the BaFe\({}_{1.8}\)Co\({}_{0.2}\)As\({}_{2}\) systems [33, 31] and is temperature independent. Assuming a one-band model, this small \(R_{\rm H}\) translates to an electron density, which is approximately ten times as large as that evaluated for the BaFe\({}_{1.8}\)Co\({}_{0.2}\)As\({}_{2}\) sample [8].

Band-structure calculations were also used to evaluate the evolution of the magnetic state of BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) as a function of Ru substitution. For the \(x\)=0.0 and 0.5 structures, the lowest energy occurs for the stripe antiferromagnetic order [30] and for the \(x\)=1.0 and 1.5 substructures, the lowest-energy configuration turns out to be paramagnetic. The magnetic moments of the Fe/Ru atoms were obtained from unconstrained minimization of total energy during the self-consistent iterations in the spin-polarized calculations. It was seen that the Ru atoms always align antiferromagnetically to the Fe atoms and only in the presence of the Fe atoms, do they show a very small magnetic moment. Also, Ba and As atoms always remain nonmagnetic. Essentially, Ru atoms also like to remain nonmagnetic in this structure. In the \(x\)=0.5 and 1.5 compositions, there are three Fe(Ru) atoms for one Ru(Fe) whereas for \(x\)=1.0, there are two Fe atoms for two Ru. Due to this inherent magnetic disorder present in the \(x\)=0.5 and 1.5 compositions, the magnetic moments obtained for all the Fe(Ru) atoms in the unit cell are different. The variations in the magnitude of the maximum of Fe/Ru moment and the averaged Fe/Ru magnetic moment are shown in Fig. 8. Also shown in the figure, is the sign of the magnetic moment at each Fe site in a Fe/Ru plane, as obtained from calculations. Two points clearly emerge from this figure: (1) the average magnetic moment decreases with increase in Ru and (2) the antiferromagnetic alignment is preferred only for the \(x\)=0.0 and 0.5 compositions. A small contribution from the Ru magnetic moment is also evident from Fig. 8. The Ru atoms in BaRu\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) show zero magnetic moments.

Figure 9 displays the evolution of the Fermi surface with Ru substitution, as obtained from band-structure calculations for the spin-down bands. The three-dimensional Fermi surfaces have been plotted for the \(\langle 2\times\)\(\backslash\)2\(\times\)1 superstructure. The Fermi surfaces for the original structure [29] can be obtained from these by the corresponding transformation for the reciprocal space [**a\({}^{*}\)=**(b\({}^{**}\)+**a\({}^{**}\))**, **b\({}^{*}\)=(b\({}^{**}\)-a\({}^{**}\))**, **c\({}^{*}\)**=\(c^{**}\);**a\({}^{*}\)**, etc., are the reciprocal-lattice vectors of the original and the transformed reciprocal space, respectively]. The spin-up bands also show similar features in all the cases, except for \(x\)=0.5. A few points to mention on careful perusal of Fig. 9 are (i) the Fermi surfaces become more connected with increase in Ru content, suggestive of increased delocalization of the carriers at \(E_{\rm F}\). (ii) Fermi surfaces for spin-up and spin-down electrons become very similar with increase in Ru content, suggesting a preference for a paramagnetic ground state for a substantial increase in Ru content, (iii) the Fermi surface gets larger, indicating electron addition due to Ru substitution, and (iv) nesting decreases with increasing Ru content, as is evident from the absence of the flat portions in the Fermi-surface plots.

To experimentally investigate the magnetic moment at the Fe site, Mossbauer measurements were carried out on the \(x\) =0.0, 0.5, and 1.0 samples at 5 K. The Mossbauer data for these samples obtained at 5 K are displayed in Fig. 10. The Mossbauer data displayed for the \(x\)=0.0 and 0.5 samples [Figs. 10(a) and 10(b)], show the characteristic six finger pattern due to magnetic ordering in the spin-density-wave state of the samples at 5 K. The magnetic hyperfine split data is analyzed with normos-dist program [33] and the data of

The arrows indicate the directions and magnitude of the magnetic moment at the four distinct sites in a Fe/Ru plane of the supercell obtained from the calculations.

  superconducting sample is analyzed with normos-site program.[33] The hyperfine magnetic split spectrum is fitted to a distribution of fields for \(x\) = 0 and 0.5 samples as shown by solid lines in the figure. The probability distribution of hyperfine fields obtained from the fits, for the \(x\) = 0.0 and 0.5 samples are shown in the inset of Fig. 10(a). It is clear from the figure that the hyperfine field distribution has a maximum at a field of ~5 T in the pristine sample and it becomes more spread out in the Ru containing sample with \(x\) = 0.5. The observed value of average hyperfine field (BHF) for \(x\) = 0 sample matches closely with that obtained earlier.[1, 34] The Mossbauer spectrum of \(x\) = 1.0 sample shown in Fig. 10(c) shows a broad singlet which is similar to that reported in K-substituted samples which show superconductivity at 38 K.[34] The fitted data of Fig. 10(c) has an isomer-shift value of 0.55 +- 0.01 mm/s corresponding to superconducting phase and a doublet with the hyperfine parameters matching with the FeAs2 impurity phase.[35] The fraction of the FeAs2 phase is estimated to be about ~3.5%. Figure 10(d) shows the Mossbauer spectrum of \(x\) = 1.0 sample measured at 5 K and 5 T external magnetic field. The fact that the observed effective BHF (internal field) value is close to that of applied external magnetic field, within experimental errors, indicates that there is no magnetic ordering present in the \(x\) = 1.0 sample. The Mossbauer results thus indicate that the magnetic interactions due to the SDW phase weaken with Ru substitution and are altogether absent in the superconducting sample with Ru composition of \(x\) = 1.0.

It will be instructive to compare the phase diagrams determined from our study for the BaFe2As2-Ru,As2 system with those of other systems belonging to the BaFe2As2 class. Coexistence of SDW and SC phases, occur in all the phase diagrams irrespective of how the phase changes are induced, i.e., by pressure or substitution, isoelectronic or otherwise. Our study indicates that optimal _T_C occurs for Ru concentration between 0.75 and 0.875. This is similar to the isoelectronic substitution cases, of BaFe2As2-Pr and SrFe2-Ru,As2, in which that optimal superconductivity occurs for \(x\) ~ 0.8. Whereas, it contrasts with optimal _T_C being observed at \(x\) ~ 0.2 in the more extensively studied, BaFe2-FM,As2 systems[17] in which the TM atoms add extra electrons as compared to Fe. This difference emphasizes the fact that to effect the electronic-structure change conducive for superconductivity a much larger distortion of the lattice is required for the case of isoelectronic substitution.

## IV Summary and conclusions

Polycrystalline samples of BaFe2-Ru,As2 samples have been synthesized by solid-state reaction from the FeAs, RuAs powders, and Ba chunks under 30 bars argon pressure. Resistivity, dc magnetization, Hall-coefficient, and Mossbauer measurements were employed to characterize the physical properties of the series. A phase diagram is proposed that indicates that the spin-density-wave ground state gives way to the occurrence of superconductivity in the \(x\) range of 0.75-1.125. Hall-coefficient measurements indicate introduction of electron carriers due to Ru substitution. Mossbauer results indicate a systematic suppression of the low-temperature magnetic state with increase in Ru content. Electron doping and magnetic-moment suppression with Ru substitution are supported by the total-energy and band-structure calculations.

The ground-state-relaxed structure was obtained using the same method reported previously in literature (Ref. [29]) for the same structure. The muffin-tin radii used were \(2.2a_{0}\) for Ba and \(2.1a_{0}\) for Fe, Ru, and As, where \(a_{0}\) is the Bohr radius (Ref. [29]). The calculation was converged with respect to the energy, charge displacement, and forces to the tune of \(10^{-6}\) Ry, \(10^{-6}\) bohr, and 1 mRy/bohr.
