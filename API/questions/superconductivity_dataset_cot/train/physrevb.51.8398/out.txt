###### Abstract

We have recently shown a possible coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in the Sc_{5-x}Dy_{x}Ir_{4}Si_{10} system from susceptibility (\chi) and resistivity (\rho) measurements. In this paper, we present heat-capacity (C_{p}) data for the same system which establishes the bulk nature of antiferromagnetic ordering in Dy_{3}Ir_{4}Si_{10} and the coexistence of bulk superconductivity and magnetism in Sc_{3},Ir_{1.5}Si_{10}. Our heat-capacity data on Dy samples show considerable contribution from the Schottky effect due to the crystal fields and we have proposed a model which fits well to the \chi and C_{p} data of all the Dy samples with the same crystal field parameters.

\[\Theta_{D}=\left[\frac{12\pi^{4}Nrk_{B}}{5\beta}\right]^{1/3}\,,\] (2)

where N is the Avogadro's number, r is the number of atoms per formula unit, and k_{B} is the Boltzmann's constant. Using the value of \Theta_{D} and T_{c}, we can estimate the electron-phonon scattering parameter l from the McMillan theory[11] where l is given by

\[\lambda=\frac{1.04+\mu^{\star}\ln(\Theta_{D}/1.45T_{c})}{(1-0.62\mu^{\star})\ln(\Theta_{D}/1.45T_{c})-1.04}\,\,\,.\] (3)

Assuming _m_*=0.1, we find the value of l to be 0.7, which puts Sc5Ir4Si10 as an intermediate coupling superconductor. On the basis of purely thermodynamical arguments, the thermodynamic critical field at T =0 K [_H_c(0)] can be determined by integrating the entropy difference between the superconducting and normal states. From our experimental heat-capacity data, we obtain a value of 650 Oe for _H_c(0). One can also calculate the thermodynamical critical field _H_c(0) from the expression

\[[H_{c}(0)]^{2}=\frac{\gamma T_{c}^{2}}{0.17}\,\,\,,\] (4)

where g is the heat capacity coefficient (erg/cm3K2). This gives a value of _H_c(0) as 642 Oe. Our previous study[12] shows that the extrapolated experimental value of the upper critical field [_H_c(0)] at 0 K is 0.82 T. From this value of _H_c2(0), we can estimate the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length _x_GL(0) at T = 0 K from the relation

\[[\xi_{\rm GL}(0)]^{2}=\frac{\phi_{0}}{2\pi H_{c2}(0)}\,\,\,,\] (5)

where _ph_0 = 2.07x10-7 G cm2. This equation yields a value of 200 A for _x_GL(0). Using the expression _H_c2 = _H_c21/_x_ (where k = _l_GL/_x_GL), we get the k value as 8.9. From the value of _x_GL(0) = 200 A (determined earlier), we get a value of 1780 A for the Ginzburg-Landau penetration depth _l_GL(0). The value of the lower critical field at T = 0 K can be estimated using the relation[13]

\[H_{c1}(0)=\frac{H_{c}(0)\ln(\kappa)}{2^{1/2}\kappa}\,\,\,,\] (6)

which yields a value of 113 Oe for the lower critical field at 0 K. This value of _H_c1(0) has to be verified with magnetization measurements on the same sample. Detailed magnetization measurements on this sample are in progress and will be reported elsewhere. The enhanced density of states can be calculated using _N*(E__F_) = 0.2121g/_N_ where N is the number of atoms per formula unit and g is expressed in mJ/mol K2. The value of _N*(E__F_) is 0.2 states/(eV atom spin-direction) and the value of the bare density of states _N_(E_{F}) = _N*(E__F_)/(1 + _l_) = 0.01 states/(eV atom spin-direction). The normal-state and superconducting-state properties of Sc5Ir4Si10 are given in Table I.

The heat capacity of Dy5Ir4Si10 measured between 2 and 35 K, is shown in Fig. 2. A plot of C_{p} versus T3 (not shown) showed a linear relationship in the temperature range of 15-35 K, which clearly indicates that the lattice contribution to C_{p} has _BT_3 behavior with b = 1.00 mJ/mol K4. The magnetic heat capacity, obtained by subtracting the lattice contribution (_BT_3) from the observed heat capacity and the corresponding values of entropy are shown in Fig. 3. The total entropy below T_{N} is 0.45R and is close to the value of 0.5R which is expected from a magnetic system whose crystal-field ground state is a doublet. A _l_-type anomaly due to antiferromagnetic ordering is observed at 5.0 K. Above 8 K, a Schottky-type anomaly appears with a maximum at 32 K. Exactly the same behavior of the Schottky anomaly was observed by subtracting the heat capacity of the isomorphous nonmagnetic compound Y5Ir4Si10 from the observed heat capacity of Dy5Ir4Si10. The temperature dependence of the heat capacity of Sc3,5Dy1,5Ir4Si10 is shown in Fig. 4.

  As in the case of Dy_{3}Ir_{x}Si_{10}, a linear behavior in C_{p} versus T^{3} is observed for Sc_{3.5}Dy_{1.5}Ir_{4}Si_{10} in the temperature range 15-35 K with \beta=0.51 mJ/mol K [4]. This sample which undergoes superconducting ordering below 5 K (Ref. 1) also shows a small anomaly in C_{p} near 5 K as shown in the inset of Fig. 4. The magnetic heat capacity (shown in Fig. 5) exhibits a \lambda-type anomaly at 3.6 K, and above 7 K a Schottky-type anomaly appears with a maximum around 26 K. The Schottky anomaly for Dy_{3}Ir_{4}Si_{10} has a maximum value at 32 K whereas that of Sc_{3.5}Dy_{1.5}Ir_{4}Si_{10} has a maximum value at 26 K. The observation of such an anomaly in both compounds suggests that the effects of the crystalline electric fields are similar in nature.

### Crystal field analysis

The strong influence of the exchange interaction is clearly observed from low-temperature heat-capacity and magnetic-susceptibility studies. The Schottky anomaly in the magnetic heat capacity shows that there is a consider

  able effect of the crystalline electric field. We have analyzed the experimental results by taking into account both crystalline electric field and exchange interactions.

The Hamiltonian of the system consisting of the spin-orbit coupling, crystalline electric field, Zeeman, and exchange field terms,

\[{\cal H} = \lambda {\bf L} \cdot {\bf S} + {\cal H}_{c} + \beta {\bf H} \cdot ({\bf L} + 2{\bf S}) + {\cal H}_{\rm ex}\]

, is diagonalized within the substates arising from the lowest multiplet of Dy3+ (J = \frac{15}{2}) to obtain the energy and eigenfunctions of the Dy3+ ion. We neglected higher J multiplets to reduce the size of the matrix to be diagonalized and because they lie far off in energy [14] (> 3300 cm-1) so that the contribution of the excited J multiplets to the susceptibility, either directly or indirectly, is negli-

Sc5-_x_Dy_x_Ir_dSi10 (x = 5,4,1.5) compounds crystallize in the tetragonal Sc5Ir4Si10 type crystal structure and belong to the P4/mbm space group. It is important to note that there are three crystallographically inequivalent sites for Sc (or Dy) in this structure, viz., Sc(1) occupies the 2(a) position, Sc(2) and Sc(3) occupy 4(h) position and all of them have different coordination (local site symmetry). At each site, because of lower symmetry, the J = \frac{15}{2} state (ground multiplet) of each Dy3+ ion would split by the crystalline electric field to give eight different doublets. The effect of the crystalline electric field at each site would be different and the total number of crystal-field parameters representing the splitting of J = \frac{15}{2} multiplets would be significantly large.

Experimentally, we observe only an average effect of the crystalline electric fields on both the magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity, which is a combined effect for all three sites. We simulate these average crystal-field effects by assuming the overall (average) crystal field to be tetragonal corresponding to the crystallographic symmetry. The Hamiltonian for such a tetragonal crystal field consists of cubic and axial distortion terms. In order to keep the number of parameters to a minimum, we retain the fourth-order cubic terms and second-order axial distortion term only. The crystal-field Hamiltonian in terms of tensor operators C_{m}^{(n)}, after retaining only these terms, can be written as [15]

\[{\cal H}_{c} = B_{2} \sum C_{0}^{(2)} + B_{4} \sum[ C_{0}^{(4)} + (\frac{5}{14})^{1/2}(C_{-4}^{(4)} + C_{+4}^{(4)})]\]

. Thus, B_{4} determines the strength of cubic crystal field while B_{2} represents the strength of the axial distortion.

In the cubic crystal field, for negative B_{4}, quartet (\Gamma_{8}^{(1)}) would be the ground state, whereas, for positive B_{4}, doublet (\Gamma_{6}) would be the ground state. We found, that the Schottky anomaly in the observed magnetic heat capacity and the corresponding entropy could be analyzed with doublet (\Gamma_{6}) as a crystal-field ground state. We obtained a reasonably good fit to the entropy and Schottky anomaly with B_{4} = 770 cm-1 and B_{2} = 98 cm-1. The calculated and experimental magnetic heat capacity and entropy of Dy3Ir4Si10 is shown in Fig. 3. The quality of fit to the Schottky anomaly is not very good compared to that of the magnetic-susceptibility fit (which will be described in the following section) because of the inherent error in the subtraction of the lattice part of the heat capacity (which is also very large at these temperatures). The calculated crystalline electric-field level scheme for Dy3Ir4Si10 is shown in Fig. 6.

From the Schottky anomaly data for Sc3,5Dy1,5Ir4Si10, we conclude that crystal-field effects in the Sc5-_x_Dy_x_Ir_dSi10 (x = 5,4,1.5) series of compounds are similar with B_{4} = 770 cm-1 and B_{2} = 98 cm-1 as in Dy3Ir4Si10. The temperature dependences of the experimental magnetic susceptibilities of Sc5-_x_Dy_x_Ir_dSi10 in the entire range of temperature 2-300 K for x = 5, 4, and 1.5 are shown in Figs. 7, 8, and 9, respectively. The \lambda-type anomaly in the heat capacity and cusp in the magnetic susceptibility at low temperatures show that the compounds Sc5-_x_Dy_x_Ir_dSi10 for x = 5, 4, and 1.5 order antiferromagnetically below 5.0, 4.5, and 3.6 K, respectively. The sharp drop in \chi below 7 K for the x = 1.5 sample is due to the onset of superconductivity in this sample at 5 K.

The exchange interaction, in the molecular field framework, above the Neel temperature is given by

\[{\cal H}_{\rm ex} = - 2zJ\langle {\bf S} \rangle \cdot {\bf S}\]

. Here z is the number of nearest equivalent neighbors interacting with the exchange interaction J, and \langle S\rangle is the expectation value of the spin operator S. An iterative procedure is used to calculate \langle S\rangle self-consistently. The details of this procedure are discussed by Marathe and Mitra.[16] In our analysis, zJ would represent the average exchange interaction for all the three sites with their respective neighbors.

We have fixed the crystal-field parameters, B_{4} and B_{2}, obtained from the analysis of the heat-capacity data of

  the compound Dy_{3}Ir_{4}Si_{10} and varied the exchange parameter _zJ_ to get the best fit to the experimentally observed magnetic-susceptibility data of Sc_{5-x}Dy_{x}Ir_{4}Si_{10} (x\!=\!5,4,1.5) compounds. The calculated magnetic susceptibility agrees very well with the experimentally observed data of Sc_{5-x}Dy_{x}Ir_{4}Si_{10} (x\!=\!5,4,1.5) in the entire temperature range of 5-300 K for _zJ_ = - 1.10, -0.83, and -0.93 cm^{-1}, respectively. The calculated and experimentally observed susceptibilities are shown in the Figs. 7-9. Note that the ratio of _zJ_ for x = 4 and 5 (0.8) matches approximately with the respective ratio of T_{N} (0.9). The large value of _zJ_ for Sc_{3,3}Dy_{1,5}Ir_{4}Si_{10} is unrealistic because of the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism at low temperatures. The magnetic susceptibility of Dy_{1,5}Sc_{3,5}Ir_{4}Si_{10} shows that the effect of superconductivity starts setting up at temperatures much higher than 7 K, at which it becomes a superconductor. Therefore, near the superconducting transition temperature, the paramagnetic susceptibility gets significantly reduced; thus, the increase in the value of the parameter _zJ_.

### Coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity

In general, introduction of magnetic atoms in a superconductor decreases its transition temperature due to strong pair breaking. This pair breaking arises because of the exchange interaction of the conduction electrons with the localized magnetic moment. However, in the case of chalcogenides and rhodium borides,1 the exchange interaction between the conduction electrons and the localized magnetic moments is small and it is of the order I \approx 0.01 eV.1 The small magnitude of I enables both _R_Rh_{4}B_{4} and _R_Mo_{6}S_{8} compounds to retain their superconductivity even in the presence of a relatively large concentration of rare-earth magnetic moments, which results in magnetic ordering via indirect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction at low temperatures that are comparable to superconducting transition temperatures. The reason for the small magnitude of the exchange interaction lies in the structure of these compounds. For instance, in the case of _R_Mo_{6}S_{8},17 the rare-earth atom occupies the first site at the rhombohedral cell and therefore they are situated far away from Mo atoms, which results in weak _d-f_ exchange.

In the case of the _R__{5}Ir_{4}Si_{10} system, there are no transition-metal clusters and this structure can be described by the stacking of the two types of building blocks, trigonal prisms SiSc_{6} and distorted tetragonal an

  tiprisms IrSi_{4}Sc_{4}.[5] All Ir-Si and Si-Si distances are short (2-2.5 A), which indicates strong covalent interactions. As we have mentioned earlier, the Sc atoms have three different sites to occupy and the substituted Dy atom can occupy any one of these sites. 'The bond distance between Sc in one of the three sites with Ir atoms is of the order of 3 A, whereas the minimum distance between any two Sc sites is greater than 5 A. These distances are probably large enough so that the exchange interaction between the magnetic moment of Dy and the conduction electrons is weak. The weak depression of T_{e} with x in Sc_{5-x}Dy_{x}Ir_{x}Si_{10} (Refs. 2 and 3) supports this view. In chalcogenides and borides, one observes an anomaly in the H_{c2} vs T curve near T_{N} in samples which show coexistence of antiferromagnetic ordering and superconductivity.[18, 19] This has been attributed to various factors such as the reduction in electron-electron interaction by antiferromagnetic magnons, the increase in pair breaking due to moment fluctuations near T_{N}, etc.[20] Our preliminary study on the H_{c2} of Sc_{3.5}Dy_{1.5}Ir_{x}Si_{10} (Ref. 12) shows no such anomaly near T_{N}. This suggests that the influence of antiferromagnetic ordering on superconductivity is very small in these compounds.

## IV Conclusion

We have established the bulk antiferromagnetic ordering in Dy_{5}Ir_{4}Si_{10} at 5 K and the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in Sc_{3.5}Dy_{1.5}Ir_{x}Si_{10}. The Dy samples show a Schottky anomaly in the magnetic heat at 32 K and 26 K for x = 5.0 and x = 1.5. This anomaly arises due to crystal-field effects of the Dy^{3+} ion. Since Dy has three sites in Dy_{5}Ir_{4}Si_{10}, we assumed the overall crystal field (average) to be tetragonal and considered a crystal-field Hamiltonian up to fourth-order cubic and second-order axial terms. This simple analysis (with exchange interaction) gave consistent results for a crystal-field scheme for the Dy ion which could be fitted to both \chi as well as C_{p} data. However, the final confirmation of this model requires detailed neutron-scattering measurements on this system.

###### Abstract

We have recently shown a possible coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in the Sc_{5-x}Dy_{x}Ir_{4}Si_{10} system from susceptibility (\chi) and resistivity (\rho) measurements. In this paper, we present heat-capacity (C_{p}) data for the same system which establishes the bulk nature of antiferromagnetic ordering in Dy_{3}Ir_{4}Si_{10} and the coexistence of bulk superconductivity and magnetism in Sc_{3},Ir_{1.5}Si_{10}. Our heat-capacity data on Dy samples show considerable contribution from the Schottky effect due to the crystal fields and we have proposed a model which fits well to the \chi and C_{p} data of all the Dy samples with the same crystal field parameters.

\[\Theta_{D}=\left[\frac{12\pi^{4}Nrk_{B}}{5\beta}\right]^{1/3}\,,\] (2)

where N is the Avogadro's number, r is the number of atoms per formula unit, and k_{B} is the Boltzmann's constant. Using the value of \Theta_{D} and T_{c}, we can estimate the electron-phonon scattering parameter l from the McMillan theory[11] where l is given by

\[\lambda=\frac{1.04+\mu^{\star}\ln(\Theta_{D}/1.45T_{c})}{(1-0.62\mu^{\star})\ln(\Theta_{D}/1.45T_{c})-1.04}\,\,\,.\] (3)

Assuming _m_*=0.1, we find the value of l to be 0.7, which puts Sc5Ir4Si10 as an intermediate coupling superconductor. On the basis of purely thermodynamical arguments, the thermodynamic critical field at T =0 K [_H_c(0)] can be determined by integrating the entropy difference between the superconducting and normal states. From our experimental heat-capacity data, we obtain a value of 650 Oe for _H_c(0). One can also calculate the thermodynamical critical field _H_c(0) from the expression

\[[H_{c}(0)]^{2}=\frac{\gamma T_{c}^{2}}{0.17}\,\,\,,\] (4)

where g is the heat capacity coefficient (erg/cm3K2). This gives a value of _H_c(0) as 642 Oe. Our previous study[12] shows that the extrapolated experimental value of the upper critical field [_H_c(0)] at 0 K is 0.82 T. From this value of _H_c2(0), we can estimate the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length _x_GL(0) at T = 0 K from the relation

\[[\xi_{\rm GL}(0)]^{2}=\frac{\phi_{0}}{2\pi H_{c2}(0)}\,\,\,,\] (5)

where _ph_0 = 2.07x10-7 G cm2. This equation yields a value of 200 A for _x_GL(0). Using the expression _H_c2 = _H_c21/_x_ (where k = _l_GL/_x_GL), we get the k value as 8.9. From the value of _x_GL(0) = 200 A (determined earlier), we get a value of 1780 A for the Ginzburg-Landau penetration depth _l_GL(0). The value of the lower critical field at T = 0 K can be estimated using the relation[13]

\[H_{c1}(0)=\frac{H_{c}(0)\ln(\kappa)}{2^{1/2}\kappa}\,\,\,,\] (6)

which yields a value of 113 Oe for the lower critical field at 0 K. This value of _H_c1(0) has to be verified with magnetization measurements on the same sample. Detailed magnetization measurements on this sample are in progress and will be reported elsewhere. The enhanced density of states can be calculated using _N*(E__F_) = 0.2121g/_N_ where N is the number of atoms per formula unit and g is expressed in mJ/mol K2. The value of _N*(E__F_) is 0.2 states/(eV atom spin-direction) and the value of the bare density of states _N_(E_{F}) = _N*(E__F_)/(1 + _l_) = 0.01 states/(eV atom spin-direction). The normal-state and superconducting-state properties of Sc5Ir4Si10 are given in Table I.

The heat capacity of Dy5Ir4Si10 measured between 2 and 35 K, is shown in Fig. 2. A plot of C_{p} versus T3 (not shown) showed a linear relationship in the temperature range of 15-35 K, which clearly indicates that the lattice contribution to C_{p} has _BT_3 behavior with b = 1.00 mJ/mol K4. The magnetic heat capacity, obtained by subtracting the lattice contribution (_BT_3) from the observed heat capacity and the corresponding values of entropy are shown in Fig. 3. The total entropy below T_{N} is 0.45R and is close to the value of 0.5R which is expected from a magnetic system whose crystal-field ground state is a doublet. A _l_-type anomaly due to antiferromagnetic ordering is observed at 5.0 K. Above 8 K, a Schottky-type anomaly appears with a maximum at 32 K. Exactly the same behavior of the Schottky anomaly was observed by subtracting the heat capacity of the isomorphous nonmagnetic compound Y5Ir4Si10 from the observed heat capacity of Dy5Ir4Si10. The temperature dependence of the heat capacity of Sc3,5Dy1,5Ir4Si10 is shown in Fig. 4.

This sample which undergoes superconducting ordering below 5 K (Ref. 1) also shows a small anomaly in C_{p} near 5 K as shown in the inset of Fig. 4. The magnetic heat capacity (shown in Fig. 5) exhibits a \lambda-type anomaly at 3.6 K, and above 7 K a Schottky-type anomaly appears with a maximum around 26 K. The Schottky anomaly for Dy_{3}Ir_{4}Si_{10} has a maximum value at 32 K whereas that of Sc_{3.5}Dy_{1.5}Ir_{4}Si_{10} has a maximum value at 26 K. The observation of such an anomaly in both compounds suggests that the effects of the crystalline electric fields are similar in nature.

### Crystal field analysis

The strong influence of the exchange interaction is clearly observed from low-temperature heat-capacity and magnetic-susceptibility studies. The Schottky anomaly in the magnetic heat capacity shows that there is a consider

  able effect of the crystalline electric field. We have analyzed the experimental results by taking into account both crystalline electric field and exchange interactions.

The Hamiltonian of the system consisting of the spin-orbit coupling, crystalline electric field, Zeeman, and exchange field terms,

\[{\cal H} = \lambda {\bf L} \cdot {\bf S} + {\cal H}_{c} + \beta {\bf H} \cdot ({\bf L} + 2{\bf S}) + {\cal H}_{\rm ex}\]

, is diagonalized within the substates arising from the lowest multiplet of Dy3+ (J = \frac{15}{2}) to obtain the energy and eigenfunctions of the Dy3+ ion. We neglected higher J multiplets to reduce the size of the matrix to be diagonalized and because they lie far off in energy [14] (> 3300 cm-1) so that the contribution of the excited J multiplets to the susceptibility, either directly or indirectly, is negli-

Sc5-_x_Dy_x_Ir_dSi10 (x = 5,4,1.5) compounds crystallize in the tetragonal Sc5Ir4Si10 type crystal structure and belong to the P4/mbm space group. It is important to note that there are three crystallographically inequivalent sites for Sc (or Dy) in this structure, viz., Sc(1) occupies the 2(a) position, Sc(2) and Sc(3) occupy 4(h) position and all of them have different coordination (local site symmetry). At each site, because of lower symmetry, the J = \frac{15}{2} state (ground multiplet) of each Dy3+ ion would split by the crystalline electric field to give eight different doublets. The effect of the crystalline electric field at each site would be different and the total number of crystal-field parameters representing the splitting of J = \frac{15}{2} multiplets would be significantly large.

Experimentally, we observe only an average effect of the crystalline electric fields on both the magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity, which is a combined effect for all three sites. We simulate these average crystal-field effects by assuming the overall (average) crystal field to be tetragonal corresponding to the crystallographic symmetry. The Hamiltonian for such a tetragonal crystal field consists of cubic and axial distortion terms. In order to keep the number of parameters to a minimum, we retain the fourth-order cubic terms and second-order axial distortion term only. The crystal-field Hamiltonian in terms of tensor operators C_{m}^{(n)}, after retaining only these terms, can be written as [15]

\[{\cal H}_{c} = B_{2} \sum C_{0}^{(2)} + B_{4} \sum[ C_{0}^{(4)} + (\frac{5}{14})^{1/2}(C_{-4}^{(4)} + C_{+4}^{(4)})]\]

. Thus, B_{4} determines the strength of cubic crystal field while B_{2} represents the strength of the axial distortion.

In the cubic crystal field, for negative B_{4}, quartet (\Gamma_{8}^{(1)}) would be the ground state, whereas, for positive B_{4}, doublet (\Gamma_{6}) would be the ground state. We found, that the Schottky anomaly in the observed magnetic heat capacity and the corresponding entropy could be analyzed with doublet (\Gamma_{6}) as a crystal-field ground state. We obtained a reasonably good fit to the entropy and Schottky anomaly with B_{4} = 770 cm-1 and B_{2} = 98 cm-1. The calculated and experimental magnetic heat capacity and entropy of Dy3Ir4Si10 is shown in Fig. 3. The quality of fit to the Schottky anomaly is not very good compared to that of the magnetic-susceptibility fit (which will be described in the following section) because of the inherent error in the subtraction of the lattice part of the heat capacity (which is also very large at these temperatures). The calculated crystalline electric-field level scheme for Dy3Ir4Si10 is shown in Fig. 6.

From the Schottky anomaly data for Sc3,5Dy1,5Ir4Si10, we conclude that crystal-field effects in the Sc5-_x_Dy_x_Ir_dSi10 (x = 5,4,1.5) series of compounds are similar with B_{4} = 770 cm-1 and B_{2} = 98 cm-1 as in Dy3Ir4Si10. The temperature dependences of the experimental magnetic susceptibilities of Sc5-_x_Dy_x_Ir_dSi10 in the entire range of temperature 2-300 K for x = 5, 4, and 1.5 are shown in Figs. 7, 8, and 9, respectively. The \lambda-type anomaly in the heat capacity and cusp in the magnetic susceptibility at low temperatures show that the compounds Sc5-_x_Dy_x_Ir_dSi10 for x = 5, 4, and 1.5 order antiferromagnetically below 5.0, 4.5, and 3.6 K, respectively. The sharp drop in \chi below 7 K for the x = 1.5 sample is due to the onset of superconductivity in this sample at 5 K.

The exchange interaction, in the molecular field framework, above the Neel temperature is given by

\[{\cal H}_{\rm ex} = - 2zJ\langle {\bf S} \rangle \cdot {\bf S}\]

. Here z is the number of nearest equivalent neighbors interacting with the exchange interaction J, and \langle S\rangle is the expectation value of the spin operator S. An iterative procedure is used to calculate \langle S\rangle self-consistently. The details of this procedure are discussed by Marathe and Mitra.[16] In our analysis, zJ would represent the average exchange interaction for all the three sites with their respective neighbors.

We have fixed the crystal-field parameters, B_{4} and B_{2}, obtained from the analysis of the heat-capacity data of

  the compound Dy_{3}Ir_{4}Si_{10} and varied the exchange parameter _zJ_ to get the best fit to the experimentally observed magnetic-susceptibility data of Sc_{5-x}Dy_{x}Ir_{4}Si_{10} (x\!=\!5,4,1.5) compounds. The calculated magnetic susceptibility agrees very well with the experimentally observed data of Sc_{5-x}Dy_{x}Ir_{4}Si_{10} (x\!=\!5,4,1.5) in the entire temperature range of 5-300 K for _zJ_ = - 1.10, -0.83, and -0.93 cm^{-1}, respectively. The calculated and experimentally observed susceptibilities are shown in the Figs. 7-9. Note that the ratio of _zJ_ for x = 4 and 5 (0.8) matches approximately with the respective ratio of T_{N} (0.9). The large value of _zJ_ for Sc_{3,3}Dy_{1,5}Ir_{4}Si_{10} is unrealistic because of the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism at low temperatures. The magnetic susceptibility of Dy_{1,5}Sc_{3,5}Ir_{4}Si_{10} shows that the effect of superconductivity starts setting up at temperatures much higher than 7 K, at which it becomes a superconductor. Therefore, near the superconducting transition temperature, the paramagnetic susceptibility gets significantly reduced; thus, the increase in the value of the parameter _zJ_.

### Coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity

In general, introduction of magnetic atoms in a superconductor decreases its transition temperature due to strong pair breaking. This pair breaking arises because of the exchange interaction of the conduction electrons with the localized magnetic moment. However, in the case of chalcogenides and rhodium borides,1 the exchange interaction between the conduction electrons and the localized magnetic moments is small and it is of the order I \approx 0.01 eV.1 The small magnitude of I enables both _R_Rh_{4}B_{4} and _R_Mo_{6}S_{8} compounds to retain their superconductivity even in the presence of a relatively large concentration of rare-earth magnetic moments, which results in magnetic ordering via indirect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction at low temperatures that are comparable to superconducting transition temperatures. The reason for the small magnitude of the exchange interaction lies in the structure of these compounds. For instance, in the case of _R_Mo_{6}S_{8},17 the rare-earth atom occupies the first site at the rhombohedral cell and therefore they are situated far away from Mo atoms, which results in weak _d-f_ exchange.

In the case of the _R__{5}Ir_{4}Si_{10} system, there are no transition-metal clusters and this structure can be described by the stacking of the two types of building blocks, trigonal prisms SiSc_{6} and distorted tetragonal an

  tiprisms IrSi_{4}Sc_{4}.[5] All Ir-Si and Si-Si distances are short (2-2.5 A), which indicates strong covalent interactions. As we have mentioned earlier, the Sc atoms have three different sites to occupy and the substituted Dy atom can occupy any one of these sites. 'The bond distance between Sc in one of the three sites with Ir atoms is of the order of 3 A, whereas the minimum distance between any two Sc sites is greater than 5 A. These distances are probably large enough so that the exchange interaction between the magnetic moment of Dy and the conduction electrons is weak. The weak depression of T_{e} with x in Sc_{5-x}Dy_{x}Ir_{x}Si_{10} (Refs. 2 and 3) supports this view. In chalcogenides and borides, one observes an anomaly in the H_{c2} vs T curve near T_{N} in samples which show coexistence of antiferromagnetic ordering and superconductivity.[18, 19] This has been attributed to various factors such as the reduction in electron-electron interaction by antiferromagnetic magnons, the increase in pair breaking due to moment fluctuations near T_{N}, etc.[20] Our preliminary study on the H_{c2} of Sc_{3.5}Dy_{1.5}Ir_{x}Si_{10} (Ref. 12) shows no such anomaly near T_{N}. This suggests that the influence of antiferromagnetic ordering on superconductivity is very small in these compounds.

## IV Conclusion

We have established the bulk antiferromagnetic ordering in Dy_{5}Ir_{4}Si_{10} at 5 K and the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in Sc_{3.5}Dy_{1.5}Ir_{x}Si_{10}. The Dy samples show a Schottky anomaly in the magnetic heat at 32 K and 26 K for x = 5.0 and x = 1.5. This anomaly arises due to crystal-field effects of the Dy^{3+} ion. Since Dy has three sites in Dy_{5}Ir_{4}Si_{10}, we assumed the overall crystal field (average) to be tetragonal and considered a crystal-field Hamiltonian up to fourth-order cubic and second-order axial terms. This simple analysis (with exchange interaction) gave consistent results for a crystal-field scheme for the Dy ion which could be fitted to both \chi as well as C_{p} data. However, the final confirmation of this model requires detailed neutron-scattering measurements on this system.
