###### Abstract

Zn-impurity-induced anisotropy reduction of superconductivity is obtained from a resistive transition analysis of single-crystal YBa2(Cu1-_z_Zn_n_n_n_n_-_d_. The out-of-plane resistivity (\rho_{e}) increases with Zn doping, while the carrier concentration remains almost unchanged. The results are not consistent with the simple Lawrence-Doniach model. Instead, an anisotropic three-dimensional metal model seems to be promising. A Zeeman-contribution-subtracted magnetoresistance analysis indicates that a Zn impurity does not cause any magnetic pair breaking.

The effect of impurities on high-T_{c} superconductivity is considerably different from that on conventional superconductivity.[1] Especially, Zn substitution for Cu caused a lot of discussion about the T_{c} reduction mechanism.[2, 3] In this paper, we report on the normal and superconducting transport properties on Zn-doped YBa2(Cu1-_z_Zn_n_n_n_n_n_n_d_. Single crystals. We focus our attention on the dimensionality of the one-electron state in YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (YBCO), as well as the magnetic vs nonmagnetic issue of Zn impurities.[4, 5]

How impurities cause mixing of one-electron states depends on their dimensionality. For instance, if the one-electron state is strictly two dimensional, confined in the CuO2 plane, the impurity causes mixing of only in-plane states. Consequently, \rho_{e} remains essentially unchanged upon impurity doping. A similar effect is also expected in the superconducting state.

To obtain information about the anisotropy in the superconducting state, we estimate the in-plane and out-of-plane coherence lengths from a resistive transition analysis of single-crystal YBa2(Cu1-_z_Zn_n_n_n_n_n_d_. Single crystals. The small change in the average d\rho/dT with x indicates that Zn only slightly affects the carrier concentration and the inelastic scattering processes.

We cannot obtain a reliable value of coherence lengths from conventional H_{\rm cg} measurements, due to the broadening of the resistive transition under a magnetic field. Recently, Ikeda, Ohmi, and Tsuneto[6] proposed a phenomenological theory which succeeded in describing the resistive transition, and offering a reliable estimation for the coherence lengths. The theory is valid over a wide range of magnetic field and temperature, the Ginzburg-Landau-fluctuation regime, as long as flux motion is not important. Here, we use their theory to obtain the coherence lengths. Figures 2(a)-2(c) show the resistive tran

 sition of single-crystal YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{7-\delta} with applied field in the c direction and current flow in the a-b plane. In the analysis, we assume \rho_{ab_{0}}, the in-plane resistivity without superconducting fluctuation, to be a linear extrapolation of the resistivity curve at higher temperatures. The fluctuational contributions from Landau levels up to the 1000th level are taken into account. Five quantities are obtained from the analysis: the mean-field critical temperature T_{c0}, the in-plane and c-axis coherence lengths \xi_{ab0} and \xi_{c0}, the specific-heat jump \Delta C, and the C factor. The C factor is a scaling factor which adjusts resistivity of a real sample to that of an ideal sample.[10] In a real sample, current still does not flow uniformly on a submacroscopic scale, because of possible imperfections. We fixed the distance between the conduction layers to c, the unit-cell dimension, of Zn-doped YBCO.[7] In the analysis, we first optimize \xi_{c} and the C factor to roughly reproduce the resistivity data without magnetic field near the critical temperature. After that, we optimize the other parameters to reproduce the resistivity data under magnetic field above the "knee" temperature. Then we repeat this process until iteratively a satisfactory fit is obtained. The obtained parameters are listed in Table 1. Slightly larger \Delta C values are obtained in our analysis compared to reported values for Zn-doped YBCO ceramic.[11, 12] If we use the reported values, the fluctuational conductivity decreases and the fitting considerably deviates for samples C and D. For all Zn-doped crystals the theory fits very well. This indicates that there is a certain temperature range below T_{c_{0}}, where Zn impurities do not cause any flux pinning and the superconducting fluctuation is the relevant factor for generating the resistivity.

In Fig. 3, \xi_{ab0} and \xi_{c0} are plotted against Zn content x. As x increases, both \xi_{ab0} and \xi_{c0} increase but \xi_{c0} increases faster than \xi_{ab0}. A considerable reduction of anisotropy of \xi is observed. This reduction of anisotropy can also be concluded from the magnetoresistance measurements in the Gaussian fluctuation region.[13] In general, as T_{c} is reduced an isotropical increase of the coherence length is expected by the relation \xi\propto\hbar v_{F}/\Delta. However, a change in anisotropy cannot be explained by a T_{c} reduction. According to the Lawrence-Doniach (LD) model,[14] if the in-plane effective mass (m_{ab}^{*}) and the Fermi energy remain unchanged on Zn doping,[15] an increase in \xi_{c} means an increase of the tunneling between conduction layers, and it should consequently reduce \rho_{c}. In Fig. 4 the c-axis normal-state resistivity \rho_{c} for x=0, 0.01, and 0.03 obtained by Montgomery measurements[16, 17] are shown. No \rho_{c} reduction by Zn doping is observed. On the other hand, in fully oxidized crystals, both \rho_{ab} and \rho_{c} are metallic, i.e., d\rho/dT>0,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Sample & A & B & C & D \\ \hline x (^{\rm W}) & 0.0 & 0.7\pm 0.1 & 1.55\pm 0.1 & 3.0\pm 0.1 \\ T_{c} (K) & 92.3 & 84.0 & 73.8 & 57.5 \\ \xi_{ab_{0}} (Å) & 9.0 & 10.0 & 13.0 & 14.5 \\ \xi_{c_{0}} (Å) & 1.0 & 1.2 & 1.8 & 2.2 \\ \Delta C  and \rho_{\rm c} is still just below the extended Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit,[18] so an anisotropic three-dimensional (3D) metal model can be applied. If we assume that Zn impurities scatter carriers isotropically, the in-plane and c-axis Fermi velocity ratio can be obtained from the square root of the resistivity increase ratio. v_{Fe}/v_{Fab}\approx 0.16. In the clean limit, \xi_{c}/\xi_{ab}=(v_{Fe}/v_{Fab})(\Delta_{ab}/\Delta_{c}). Using the obtained coherence lengths and Fermi velocity ratio, \Delta_{ab}\approx 0.7\Delta_{c} for x=0 and \Delta_{ab}\approx\Delta_{c} for x=0.03. Note that, a clean limit assumption for the c direction and the \Delta_{ab}<\Delta_{c} condition for x=0 are controversial issues. However, an anisotropic 3D metal model qualitatively explains the anisotropy reduction in superconductivity by gap averaging, and the \rho_{c} increase by elastic scattering due to Zn impurities.

Next, we consider the excess pair-breaking process caused by Zn impurities. If the Zn-induced magnetic moment is the main origin of the strong reduction of the transition temperature, it also destroys fluctuation Cooper pairs at temperatures above T_{\rm c}. This can be detected in the magnetoresistance, through the pair dephasing rate \tau_{\phi}^{-1} in the orbital contribution of the Maki-Thompson (MTO) process. To see whether \tau_{\phi}^{-1} contains an excess pair-breaking rate contribution in the Zn-substituted samples, we analyze the Zeeman-contribution-subtracted conductivity data (-\Delta\sigma_{\perp ab}+\Delta\sigma_{\parallel ab}) using the following two models.

(a) The elastic scattering model: \tau_{\phi}^{-1}=\tau_{\phi_{0}}^{-1}. Zn doping mainly causes elastic scattering, and it only reduces the MTO contribution through the reduction of the carrier mean free path, and it does not cause excess depairing.

(b) The inelastic scattering model: \tau_{\phi}^{-1}=\tau_{\phi_{0}}^{-1}+\tau_{\rm Zn}^{-1}. Zn doping causes inelastic (magnetic) scattering. It reduces the carrier mean free path and causes excess depairing.

In both cases, the same transport scattering rate \tau_{\rm q}^{-1}=\tau_{\rm q_{0}}^{-1}+\tau_{\rm Zn}^{-1} is used. We assume \tau_{\phi_{0}}^{-1}=\tau_{\rm q_{0}}^{-1} as before.[20] In sample D, the mean free path (=v_{F}\tau_{\rm q}) around T_{\rm c} can be estimated about 50 A. It is larger than the obtained in-plane coherence length \xi_{ab0}, which is about 14.5 A, so a clean-limit analysis is still valid for sample D. In a clean-limit analysis, the fluctuation contribution of the MTO process in the magnetoconductivity (-\Delta\sigma_{\rm MTO}) decreases if \ell\tau_{\phi} is reduced. So, -\Delta\sigma_{\rm MTO} is thought to be smaller in the inelastic scattering model (b) than in the elastic model (a). In the fitting, we use the same parameters as obtained from the resistive transition analysis, that is, \xi_{ab0}=14.5 A, \xi_{c0}=2.2 A, and C=1.8. We assume the Fermi velocity and the inelastic scattering rate to be the same as in the undoped samples,[19, 20] that is, v_{F}\sim 2\times 10^{7} cm/s, \hbar\tau_{\rm q}^{-1}=1.3k_{B}T. Figure 5 shows the result of the analysis. It is evident that the elastic scattering model gives a better fit to the data than the inelastic scattering model. This analysis indicates that the rapid T_{\rm c} suppression by Zn doping is not due to magnetic pair breaking.[5]

There is an assumption, \Delta(r)\simeq const, for Anderson's theory[21] of impurity effects on superconductivity. In high-T_{\rm c} superconductors, it is questionable whether this condition holds, since recent experiments suggest that the superconducting gap is anisotropic and consistent with d-wave superconductivity,[22, 23] In the case of gapless superconductivity, even a nonmagnetic impurity is destructive to the superconductivity.

In conclusion, from an analysis of the resistive transition and magnetoresistance of Zn-substituted single-crystal YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{7-\delta}, a reduction in anisotropy in the superconducting state (\xi_{ab}/\xi_{c}) is observed. On the other hand, an anisotropy reduction in the normal state is not observed from resistivity measurements. The simple LD model cannot describe this situation. An anisotropic 3D metal model qualitatively explains the results. This implies that high-T_{\rm c} models which assume strict two dimensionality cannot be applied to the YBCO system; therefore, these models are not universally applied to all high-T_{\rm c} superconductors.

A Zeeman-contribution-subtracted magnetoresistance analysis of Zn-doped single-crystal YBCO shows that Zn impurities primarily act as elastic scattering centers. Zn doping only reduces the carrier mean free path and does not cause excess depairing. These analyses show that the

Two theoretical fits are shown (solid lines) that assume the scattering caused by Zn doping to be (a) elastic and (b) inelastic.

  T_{e} suppression in this system cannot be explained by a depairing effect caused by induced magnetic moments.
