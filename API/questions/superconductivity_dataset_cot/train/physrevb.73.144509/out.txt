###### Abstract

Muon spin rotation and magnetization measurements in ultraclean single crystals of superconducting YBa2Cu3O6.0_{\rm{6+x}} (_x_ =0.375) reveal transitions at T = 19 K to a bulk superconducting state and below T = 15 K to a disordered antiferromagnetic state. The superconducting state pins magnetic flux. At the lowest temperatures an internal magnetic field with a magnitude close to that seen in the antiferromagnetic parent compound is present throughout the bulk of the sample. The two states coexist on a nanometer length scale, and over a narrow region of oxygen doping.

The close proximity of magnetic and superconducting phases is a common feature of all high-temperature superconductors and the interplay or competition between these ordered phases lies at the heart of the debate over the nature of these materials. The long-range antiferromagnetic order that is present in the parent compounds is destroyed by doping, but echoes of it are seen in the form of spin fluctuations observed far into the superconducting phase.^{1} There is also considerable evidence that the superconducting phase is highly susceptible to the formation of static moments. For example, vortices formed by applying magnetic fields develop antiferromagnetism in their cores,^{2,-3} and magnetic moments seem to be induced by the presence of certain impurities such as Zn substituted for Cu.^{4,5} Early muon spin rotation and relaxation (\muSR) measurements on the first powdered YBa2Cu3O6.0_{\rm{6+x}} cuprates^{6,-8} suggest that superconductivity coexists with static magnetic moments. Later measurements^{9} on polycrystalline YBa2Cu3O6.0_{\rm{6+x}} that has been doped with cations also show coexistence and a close agreement of the phase diagram with La2-Sr2Cu3O6. More recently, the heavily underdoped region of the phase diagram, where the superconductivity is weakest, has been explored^{10} in polycrystalline samples with \muSR. These recent results confirm the early measurements of Refs. 6-8 of the phase diagram, report a small area of overlap between superconductivity and a magnetic state, and establish that the antiferromagnetism and superconductivity occur in the entire sample very near the region of coexistence.

The meaning of this coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity is a central issue because it is not clear whether or not the static magnetic moments are secondary phenomena associated with the addition of defects and disorder, or a more general characteristic of the superconducting cuprates. In this paper we report on the presence of static moments that order at temperatures below T = 15 K in single-crystal samples of YBa2Cu3O6.0_{\rm{6+x}} (_x_ =0.375). The ordering of the large magnetic moments occurs throughout the sample, despite the fact that this is a material doped without cation defects and has much weaker charge inhomogeneity than most cuprates. The fact that these samples also superconduct suggest that microscopic coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism is a stable feature in a very narrow part of the phase diagram even in the cleanest cuprate single crystals available.

The \muSR measurements were performed at TRIUMF both in zero applied magnetic field (ZF \muSR) with the muon polarization parallel (ZF, \muSR) and perpendicular (ZF, \muSR) to the \hat{c} axis, and in an external magnetic field applied with the muon polarization perpendicular to the applied field (\mu_{0}\vec{H}) and the crystal \hat{c} axis (TF \muSR). Ultraclean YBa2Cu3O6.0_{\rm{6+x}} single crystals used in this experiment were grown by a self-flux growth method in BaZrO3 crucibles at the University of British Columbia. Precise control over oxygen concentration and overall oxygen homogeneity is required to produce the sharp superconducting transitions we observe with superconducting quantum interference device SQUID magnetometry (Fig.1). In YBa2Cu3O6.375, the transition to a superconducting state occurs at _T__{c} = 19 K. The field-cooled magnetization is approximately 30% of perfect diamagnetism, similar to

 what is typically measured for optimally doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}. Such sharp transitions are particularly difficult to achieve because of the steep linear dependence of T_{c} on x (see solid squares in Fig. 6 below). Details on the growth method and crystal characterization can be found in Ref. 11.

In Fig. 2, we show the TF \muSR precession signal in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.375} in three distinct regions of the phase diagram. In (a), the TF_{x}\muSR precession signal at T=27 K is weakly damped due to small nuclear moments characteristic of the normal state in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} crystals. (b) shows the TF signal at T=13.5 K, which is below the critical temperature (T_{c}) measured by magnetization (T_{c}=19 K) but above the magnetic transition T_{M}\approx10 K (see below). Here the sample shows an increased damping rate compared to (a) which as discussed below is partly due to the inhomogeneous field distribution present throughout the sample due to the vortex lattice. Finally, in (c) large spontaneous magnetic fields depolarize the signal rapidly at T=2 K, below T_{M}. Note that here the precession signal amplitude for t>2 \mus is close to zero, implying that all muons see large local internal fields. A measurement at T=2.5 K of the ZF \muSR precession signal (Fig. 3) reveals a broad distribution of spontaneous magnetic fields at the muon site, centered at 230 G. The rapid decay of the signal near t=0 \mus indicates that the field distribution at the muon site is broad. Since the internal field in the parent compound is 300 G,[12] we conclude that the introduction of a small number of holes into the CuO_{2} planes leads to a small but appreciable reduction in the density or magnitude of electronic moments. The presence of these large magnetic fields below T_{M} is what rapidly dampens the TF \muSR precession signal shown in Fig. 2(c).

We have measured the volume fraction of the magnetic phase in this sample with ZF \muSR. The ZF \muSR precession can be measured with the muon spin both parallel and perpendicular to the \hat{c} axis (see Fig. 3). The temperature dependence of the precession signal (P_{\mu\pm}|\hat{c}||\hat{z}) shows a single-exponential behavior at T=21 K>T_{M} with a relaxation due to Cu nuclear moments and an increase in the relaxation closer to T_{M} (T=14 K\,\approx\,T_{M}) due to a slowing down of the Cu electronic spins near the magnetic transition. At T =2.5 K, an oscillation is clearly visible near t=0.3 \mus due to static internal fields in both orientations in Fig. 3. The aver

Both orientations of the spins reveal internal fields at T=2.5 K. (b) The composite spectrum [2P_{x}(t)+P_{z}(t)]/3 shows a 1/3 nonrelaxing component indicating that internal magnetic fields are present in all of the sample.

Figure 2: (Color online) \muSR signal in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.375} in an applied field \mu_{0}H(\parallelc) = 100 G in three distinct regions of the phase diagram. The applied field causes the \muSR transverse field (TF) precession signal to oscillate at the Larmor frequency \omega= \gamma_{\mu}H while spatial inhomogeneity in the magnetic field leads to a decay in the signal. (a) Nuclear moments lead to a slow decay of the signal at T=27 K. The data is fitted to a stretch exponential for comparison to (b). (b) TF \muSR precession signal at T=13.5 K, below T_{c}=19.5 K. The increased damping [compared to (a)] below T_{c} is due to the presence of a vortex lattice. The data are fitted to a stretch exponential with parameters fixed to ZF data (see Fig. 3 below) multiplied by a Gaussian with a free damping parameter. (c) TF \muSR precession signal at T=2 K. Here the rapid damping of the signal is dominated by spontaneous magnetic fields in the magnetically ordered state. The curve is a fit with a damped Gaussian to data at t>2 \mus. The amplitude of the fitted signal is almost zero.

  age field and width of the distribution of local fields determine the fast relaxing initial signal and oscillation. The differing longer time amplitudes of the ZF_z_m_SR and ZF_z_m_SR signals are due to the projection of the average local field at the muon site along the muon spin direction. The presence of the oscillations in both orientations show that the magnetic field at the muon site is neither along the \hat{c} axis or in the ab plane, but must tilted at an angle from the \hat{c} axis. Determining the orientation of the average local field requires higher statistics and more spectra with different orientations of the initial muon spin. The average internal field measured in these ZF spectra grows from zero above the transition to 230 G as T\rightarrow 0 K, shown in Fig. 4(a) and gives a transition temperature T_{M}\approx 10 K.

More importantly, the volume fraction of the magnetic phase can be extracted from a composite of the ZF_z_ and ZF_z_ precession spectra (2_P__z_+_P__z_)/3, which is shown in Fig. 3(b). This weighted sum simulates a powder average over internal field orientations. The long time polarization is (26 +- 3)%, near the expected 1/3 for a sample where the static fields are present in the entire sample. In particular, if a fraction of the sample were nonmagnetic and did not depolarize the muon precession, the long-time polarization would be larger than 1/3.

Below T_{c} but above the magnetic transition, the TF precession signal shows damping characteristic of a vortex lattice expected in the presence of an applied magnetic field [Fig. 2(b)]. The TF \muSR polarization signal is given by e^{-(\sigma_{ZF})^{2}/2}cos(2_p_m_+_d_). The damping parameter (\sigma_{TF}) models the relaxation from both the static Cu nuclear dipole moments and slowly fluctuating Cu magnetic moments and the relaxation due to the vortex lattice that occurs below T_{c}. The internal magnetic field at the muon site (_p_) decreases at T_{c} as expected for a superconductor [Fig. 4(a)]. The ZF data are modeled with a Kubo-Toyabe function with damping parameter \sigma_{ZF} and \sigma_{ZF}/\sqrt{2} is plotted in Fig. 4(b).13 Above T_{c} the ZF relaxation rate follows the horizontal dashed line in Fig. 4(b). Below T_{c} it remains unchanged until T\approx 13.5 K, where the onset of the magnetic transition results in a large increase in \sigma_{ZF}. We have also applied a field (100 G) along the muon spin direction and measured \sigma_{ZF} (for P_{\mu}\parallel\hat{z}). A large decrease in the relaxation rate indicates that the local fields are primarily static on the muon time scale for T> 13.5 K.

Footnote 13: The \sigma_{ZF}/\sqrt{2} ratio is \approx 1.00 for T_{c}.

At T=20 K, \sigma_{ZF}/\sqrt{2} and \sigma_{TF} are equal, but below T_{c}, the TF relaxation increases. This additional relaxation must be due to the presence of a vortex lattice and this conclusion does not depend on the exact form of the fitting function in ZF or TF. This TF relaxation establishes the bulk nature of the superconductivity in this highly underdoped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.375} sample because the relaxation is present in all the TF signal. A nonsuperconducting fraction of the sample would contribute a slower relaxing signal. These conclusions are in agreement with the results of Sanna _et al._ in polycrystalline samples.10

In order to further investigate the bulk nature of the superconductivity below T_{c}, we have also measured the TF \muSR precession signal at low temperatures after shifting the applied field when at low temperature (Fig. 5). When a bulk superconductor is cooled in an applied field, pinning can trap magnetic flux in the sample. In such a case, when the applied field is changed while the sample is in the superconducting state (and below the depinning temperature), the TF signal

Diamagnetic shift of internal field (r/\gamma_{\mu}–\mu_{0}H) at muon site in an applied field \mu_{0}H(\parallel\hat{c}) = 100 G (right axis, filled triangles). (b) Relaxation rate measured in TF \muSR \sigma_{TF} (open squares) and ZF \muSR \sigma_{ZF}/\sqrt{2} (filled triangles). The ZF relaxation rate above T =13.5 K is due to Cu nuclear moments, while the Gaussian TF relaxation rate is caused by the vortex lattice that develops below T_{c} and the Cu nuclear moments. For T\approx 13.5 K, the electronic Cu spins add to the relaxation in both TF and ZF.

  will continue to precess at the Larmor frequency corresponding to the applied field on cooling. We field-cooled the sample in an applied field of m0_H_ = 308 G to T = 3 K and then decreased the applied field by 100 G. The _m_SR signal does not shift to 208 G, indicating that the low-temperature state can indeed pin the flux in the sample. In summary, we have shown that the sample exhibits a sharp superconducting transition at _T_c, evidence of a flux lattice below _T_c, and the ability to pin flux. Furthermore, a scanning Hall microscopy study on similar samples showed undistorted vortices at the surface. [14]

Together with the ZF results, these measurements show that at low temperatures single-crystal YBa2Cu3O6.375 is both superconducting and magnetic. Chemical phase separation, where the oxygen concentration varies through the sample on a mesoscopic length scale (micrometers), can be ruled out by the sharp magnetization measurements and strong variation of _T_c with small changes in x. Because the magnetic dipole field decays over about 20 A and in YBa2Cu3O6.375 all muons experience large magnetic fields of electronic origin in zero applied field, all muon sites must be within 20 A of the static magnetism, as shown in Refs. [9] and [15]. This observation excludes the kind of coexistence found in La2CuO4+-, [15] where 40 A islands occupy 40% of the sample. Thus charge and spin segregation occurs on a much finer scale in these YBa2Cu3O6+ samples, perhaps in the form of one-dimensional stripes, which have been widely reported in YBa2Cu3O6+- (Ref. [16]) and La2-Sr2CuO4, [17], two-dimensional (2D) tightly packed nanometer islands of ordered spins (spin clusters), or a 2D grid of ordered spins randomly diluted by superconducting holes.

In YBa2Cu3O6.365, there is a common transition to magnetism and superconductivity at T_{M} = T_{c} = 14.5 K, [18] and in YBa2Cu3O6+- samples with higher doping (_x_ = 0.53, T_{c} = 57 K), we have previously reported that the magnetism in zero field is absent. [2] Thus, coexistence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in these single crystals occurs in a very narrow region of the phase diagram (Fig. 6) and these two states coexist throughout the sample on a nanometer length scale, in agreement with early [6] and more recent [10] studies of powdered YBa2Cu3O66+-. Ideally, we would like to track the doping dependence of T_{M} for 0.38 < x < 0.53; however, the chain oxygens do not order in this doping range and it is not yet possible to make ultraclean single crystals in this region with good oxygen ordering. Disorder caused either by cation doping or strain, often present in powder samples, is unlikely to cause the narrow region of coexistence in these single crystals, but may be responsible for the magnetism reported at higher doping in other cuprates. [1, 9] It is possible that residual chain disorder plays a role in creating the narrow coexistence region we observe even in clean single crystals. However, the sharp superconducting transitions reported here suggests this is not the case and that there is a true, narrow region of coexistence near the antiferromagnetic-superconducting phase boundary, which is absent in most descriptions of the phase diagram.

Precise control over oxygen concentration and overall oxygen homogeneity is required to produce the sharp superconducting transitions we observe with superconducting quantum interference device SQUID magnetometry (Fig.1). In YBa2Cu3O6.375, the transition to a superconducting state occurs at _T__{c} = 19 K. The field-cooled magnetization is approximately 30% of perfect diamagnetism, similar to

 what is typically measured for optimally doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}. Such sharp transitions are particularly difficult to achieve because of the steep linear dependence of T_{c} on x (see solid squares in Fig. 6 below). Details on the growth method and crystal characterization can be found in Ref. 11.

In Fig. 2, we show the TF \muSR precession signal in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.375} in three distinct regions of the phase diagram. In (a), the TF_{x}\muSR precession signal at T=27 K is weakly damped due to small nuclear moments characteristic of the normal state in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} crystals. (b) shows the TF signal at T=13.5 K, which is below the critical temperature (T_{c}) measured by magnetization (T_{c}=19 K) but above the magnetic transition T_{M}\approx10 K (see below). Here the sample shows an increased damping rate compared to (a) which as discussed below is partly due to the inhomogeneous field distribution present throughout the sample due to the vortex lattice. Finally, in (c) large spontaneous magnetic fields depolarize the signal rapidly at T=2 K, below T_{M}. Note that here the precession signal amplitude for t>2 \mus is close to zero, implying that all muons see large local internal fields. A measurement at T=2.5 K of the ZF \muSR precession signal (Fig. 3) reveals a broad distribution of spontaneous magnetic fields at the muon site, centered at 230 G. The rapid decay of the signal near t=0 \mus indicates that the field distribution at the muon site is broad. Since the internal field in the parent compound is 300 G,[12] we conclude that the introduction of a small number of holes into the CuO_{2} planes leads to a small but appreciable reduction in the density or magnitude of electronic moments. The presence of these large magnetic fields below T_{M} is what rapidly dampens the TF \muSR precession signal shown in Fig. 2(c).

We have measured the volume fraction of the magnetic phase in this sample with ZF \muSR. The ZF \muSR precession can be measured with the muon spin both parallel and perpendicular to the \hat{c} axis (see Fig. 3). The temperature dependence of the precession signal (P_{\mu\pm}|\hat{c}||\hat{z}) shows a single-exponential behavior at T=21 K>T_{M} with a relaxation due to Cu nuclear moments and an increase in the relaxation closer to T_{M} (T=14 K\,\approx\,T_{M}) due to a slowing down of the Cu electronic spins near the magnetic transition. At T =2.5 K, an oscillation is clearly visible near t=0.3 \mus due to static internal fields in both orientations in Fig. 3. The aver

The presence of the oscillations in both orientations show that the magnetic field at the muon site is neither along the \hat{c} axis or in the ab plane, but must tilted at an angle from the \hat{c} axis. Determining the orientation of the average local field requires higher statistics and more spectra with different orientations of the initial muon spin. The average internal field measured in these ZF spectra grows from zero above the transition to 230 G as T\rightarrow 0 K, shown in Fig. 4(a) and gives a transition temperature T_{M}\approx 10 K.

More importantly, the volume fraction of the magnetic phase can be extracted from a composite of the ZF_z_ and ZF_z_ precession spectra (2_P__z_+_P__z_)/3, which is shown in Fig. 3(b). This weighted sum simulates a powder average over internal field orientations. The long time polarization is (26 +- 3)%, near the expected 1/3 for a sample where the static fields are present in the entire sample. In particular, if a fraction of the sample were nonmagnetic and did not depolarize the muon precession, the long-time polarization would be larger than 1/3.

Below T_{c} but above the magnetic transition, the TF precession signal shows damping characteristic of a vortex lattice expected in the presence of an applied magnetic field [Fig. 2(b)]. The TF \muSR polarization signal is given by e^{-(\sigma_{ZF})^{2}/2}cos(2_p_m_+_d_). The damping parameter (\sigma_{TF}) models the relaxation from both the static Cu nuclear dipole moments and slowly fluctuating Cu magnetic moments and the relaxation due to the vortex lattice that occurs below T_{c}. The internal magnetic field at the muon site (_p_) decreases at T_{c} as expected for a superconductor [Fig. 4(a)]. The ZF data are modeled with a Kubo-Toyabe function with damping parameter \sigma_{ZF} and \sigma_{ZF}/\sqrt{2} is plotted in Fig. 4(b).13 Above T_{c} the ZF relaxation rate follows the horizontal dashed line in Fig. 4(b). Below T_{c} it remains unchanged until T\approx 13.5 K, where the onset of the magnetic transition results in a large increase in \sigma_{ZF}. We have also applied a field (100 G) along the muon spin direction and measured \sigma_{ZF} (for P_{\mu}\parallel\hat{z}). A large decrease in the relaxation rate indicates that the local fields are primarily static on the muon time scale for T> 13.5 K.

Footnote 13: The \sigma_{ZF}/\sqrt{2} ratio is \approx 1.00 for T_{c}.

At T=20 K, \sigma_{ZF}/\sqrt{2} and \sigma_{TF} are equal, but below T_{c}, the TF relaxation increases. This additional relaxation must be due to the presence of a vortex lattice and this conclusion does not depend on the exact form of the fitting function in ZF or TF. This TF relaxation establishes the bulk nature of the superconductivity in this highly underdoped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.375} sample because the relaxation is present in all the TF signal. A nonsuperconducting fraction of the sample would contribute a slower relaxing signal. These conclusions are in agreement with the results of Sanna _et al._ in polycrystalline samples.10

In order to further investigate the bulk nature of the superconductivity below T_{c}, we have also measured the TF \muSR precession signal at low temperatures after shifting the applied field when at low temperature (Fig. 5). When a bulk superconductor is cooled in an applied field, pinning can trap magnetic flux in the sample. In such a case, when the applied field is changed while the sample is in the superconducting state (and below the depinning temperature), the TF signal

Diamagnetic shift of internal field (r/\gamma_{\mu}–\mu_{0}H) at muon site in an applied field \mu_{0}H(\parallel\hat{c}) = 100 G (right axis, filled triangles). (b) Relaxation rate measured in TF \muSR \sigma_{TF} (open squares) and ZF \muSR \sigma_{ZF}/\sqrt{2} (filled triangles). The ZF relaxation rate above T =13.5 K is due to Cu nuclear moments, while the Gaussian TF relaxation rate is caused by the vortex lattice that develops below T_{c} and the Cu nuclear moments. For T\approx 13.5 K, the electronic Cu spins add to the relaxation in both TF and ZF.

  will continue to precess at the Larmor frequency corresponding to the applied field on cooling. We field-cooled the sample in an applied field of m0_H_ = 308 G to T = 3 K and then decreased the applied field by 100 G. The _m_SR signal does not shift to 208 G, indicating that the low-temperature state can indeed pin the flux in the sample. In summary, we have shown that the sample exhibits a sharp superconducting transition at _T_c, evidence of a flux lattice below _T_c, and the ability to pin flux. Furthermore, a scanning Hall microscopy study on similar samples showed undistorted vortices at the surface. [14]

Together with the ZF results, these measurements show that at low temperatures single-crystal YBa2Cu3O6.375 is both superconducting and magnetic. Chemical phase separation, where the oxygen concentration varies through the sample on a mesoscopic length scale (micrometers), can be ruled out by the sharp magnetization measurements and strong variation of _T_c with small changes in x. Because the magnetic dipole field decays over about 20 A and in YBa2Cu3O6.375 all muons experience large magnetic fields of electronic origin in zero applied field, all muon sites must be within 20 A of the static magnetism, as shown in Refs. [9] and [15]. This observation excludes the kind of coexistence found in La2CuO4+-, [15] where 40 A islands occupy 40% of the sample. Thus charge and spin segregation occurs on a much finer scale in these YBa2Cu3O6+ samples, perhaps in the form of one-dimensional stripes, which have been widely reported in YBa2Cu3O6+- (Ref. [16]) and La2-Sr2CuO4, [17], two-dimensional (2D) tightly packed nanometer islands of ordered spins (spin clusters), or a 2D grid of ordered spins randomly diluted by superconducting holes.

In YBa2Cu3O6.365, there is a common transition to magnetism and superconductivity at T_{M} = T_{c} = 14.5 K, [18] and in YBa2Cu3O6+- samples with higher doping (_x_ = 0.53, T_{c} = 57 K), we have previously reported that the magnetism in zero field is absent. [2] Thus, coexistence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in these single crystals occurs in a very narrow region of the phase diagram (Fig. 6) and these two states coexist throughout the sample on a nanometer length scale, in agreement with early [6] and more recent [10] studies of powdered YBa2Cu3O66+-. Ideally, we would like to track the doping dependence of T_{M} for 0.38 < x < 0.53; however, the chain oxygens do not order in this doping range and it is not yet possible to make ultraclean single crystals in this region with good oxygen ordering. Disorder caused either by cation doping or strain, often present in powder samples, is unlikely to cause the narrow region of coexistence in these single crystals, but may be responsible for the magnetism reported at higher doping in other cuprates. [1, 9] It is possible that residual chain disorder plays a role in creating the narrow coexistence region we observe even in clean single crystals. However, the sharp superconducting transitions reported here suggests this is not the case and that there is a true, narrow region of coexistence near the antiferromagnetic-superconducting phase boundary, which is absent in most descriptions of the phase diagram.
