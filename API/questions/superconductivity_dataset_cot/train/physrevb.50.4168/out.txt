Samples of La2CuO4+-d in the range 0<d<0.1 were prepared by electrochemical insertion of oxygen in KOH; the oxygen content was determined by iodometric titration. The temperature variations of resistance R and Seeback coefficient a were used to monitor as a function of the compositional parameter d not only the evolution of the superconductive transition temperature _Tc_, but also the diffusion-controlled spinodal phase segregation occurring in the temperature range 200<_T_ <= 300 K. The data also show that the 8 interstitial oxygen atoms O1 per formula unit enter as O12 ions at least in the range 0<_d_ <= 0.070. Comparison of the transport properties of samples slow-cooled from room temperature to 77 K reveals an O1-atom segregation over the range 0<_d_ <= 0.066; this segregation disappears for d>d_d_, where the O1 atoms become ordered, and 0.066<d_0.070 was determined. Analysis of neutron-diffraction data from available literature gives a spinodal decomposition temperature T_{t} vs d that falls to 200 K at d_t_(max)=0.05; the diffusion-controlled spinodal phase segregation occurs within the phase field of the O1-disordered orthorhombic structure. The oxygen-rich phase having d_t_,(max)=0.05 is superconductive with a zero-resistance temperature T0=26 K that is lower than the T0=32 K observed for d>d_d_0; _Tc_ falls to a minimum near d=0.0625 within the compositional range d_t_,(max)<d<d_0, which suggests the presence of a competitive nonsuperconductive line phase near p = 1/2 holes per Cu atom as is found in the La2-_x_Ba2CuO4 system near x = 1/2. A nonsuperconductive transition at T_{d} = 47+-1 K was found in slow-cooled samples over the range 0<d<d_0; it is suppressed by both high pressure and the quenching procedure. We associate it with the competitive nonsuperconductive phase stabilized near p = 1/2. In the ordered-O1 phase found for d>d_0, a "tail" in the _R_-vs_-_T_ curve extends into the superconductive temperature range where _a_=0; it is attributed to a liquid-vortex state rather than a second superconductive phase. The pressure dependences of _Tc_ and the O1-atom mobility were used to distinguish the superconductive phases found for d<d_0 and d>d_0. The appearance of a nonsuperconductive line phase in the interval d_t_(max)<d<d_0 permits reconciliation of the data, including indirect evidence for charge fluctuations stabilized below a T_{P} < 150 K in this interval. The indirect evidence for charge fluctuations is the same as that discussed by us elsewhere in the framework of a model developed for the system La2-_x_Sr2CuO4.

## INTRODUCTION

As early as 1987, filamentary superconductivity was discovered in ceramic samples of La2CuO4 that had been slow cooled in air from the sintering temperature.1,2 This procedure loads the structure with excess oxygen to yield La2CuO4+-d with a maximum d=0.02.

In order to explore this phenomenon further, samples were loaded to higher values of d with high oxygen pressures,3-5 and a spinodal phase segregation into an oxygen-rich superconductive phase and an oxygen-poor antiferromagnetic phase was shown to occur below a temperature T_{t}.6 Neutron-diffraction studies6-8 performed on d=0.03 samples prepared under a _P_O2=3 kbar have given a range 290<_T__s_ <= 320 K for the onset temperature for phase segregation and a T_{t}  430 K for the orthorhombic-tetragonal transition in the single-phase region. They also indicated that the oxygen-poor, antiferromagnetic phase that initially appears on cooling is essentially the parent compound La2CuO4; its concentration increases with decreasing temperature whereas the oxygen parameter d_s_ of the superconductive phase increases with decreasing temperature. The phase segregation occurs via a diffusion of the oxygen atoms, and surprisingly these remain mobile down to about 200 K.8,9 Identification of the driving force for the observed segregation into a superconductive phase and the parent antiferromagnetic-insulator phase could prove critical to our understanding of the superconductive phase. Two alternatives need to be distinguished: (1) an electronic character of the normal state that makes the superconductive phase thermodynamically distinguishable from both the parent antiferromagnetic phase and the overdoped metallic phase and (2) an ordering of the interstitial oxygen in the superconductive phase. In order to distinguish between these alternatives, it is necessary to investigate systematically the compositional range 0.05<_d_ < 0.07, a range that has been absent from previous studies. However, this range may be complicated by the appearance of a competitive, nonsuperconductive phase appearing near the composition d=0.0625, which corresponds to p = 1/2 holes per Cu atom.

## A thermodynamically distinguishable normal state

Whereas the d=0.03 samples retain their excess oxygen at atmospheric pressure to 489 K (Ref. 6), samples d  0.05 prepared at higher _P_O2 begin to lose oxygen above room temperature.5 All samples with d  0.03 exhibit a first-order phase change with loss of oxygen above 225 degC at atmospheric pressure.5,7 For the d  0.05 sample T_{t} is lowered to near room temperature, and a discontinuous increase in the room-temperature Cu-O bond length in the CuO2 sheets was noted after traversing the first-order phase change with loss of oxygen near 225 degC; this increase in bond length was interpreted to indicate that a discontinuous increase in the equilibrium Cu-O bond length occurs on changing from a more covalent to an ionic character of the Cu-O bond.5 A discontinuous change in bond character implies a double-well potential for the Cu-O bond at the crossover from ionic to covalent bonding. One consequence of such a double-well potential would be a stabilization by high pressure of the tetragonal relative to the orthorhombic phase, i.e., a _dT__t_/_dP_ < 010, and this pressure dependence of T_{t} has been observed.11 The orthorhombic-tetragonal distortion at a transition temperature T_{t} is due to a mismatch of the basal-plane La-O and Cu-O bond lengths in the tetragonal structure that makes the tolerance factor

\[t \equiv [{\rm La} - {\rm O}]/[{\sqrt 2}[{\rm Cu} - {\rm O}]] < 1\]

decrease with decreasing temperature because of the larger thermal expansion of the La-O bond. A t < 1 places the Cu-O bonds in the CuO2 sheets under a compressive force that is relieved by the distortion to the orthorhombic phase.12 From Eq. (1), a _dT__t_/_dP_ < 0 therefore signals a _dt_/_dP_ > 0, which means that the Cu-O bonds in the basal plane are more compressible than the La-O bond as predicted for a double-well potential for the Cu-O bonds of the CuO2 sheets, provided a large fraction of the longer, ionic Cu-O bonds are present in the sheets.

A double-well potential for the Cu-O bond not only has important implications for the character of the normal state of the superconductive phase;13 it also provides a first-order driving force for a segregation in the range 0 < d < 0.05 between a parent antiferromagnetic phase with all ionic bonding and a second phase with either all covalent bonding or a vibronic resonance between ionic and covalent bonding. Were the second phase a conventional metal, we could anticipate that in it all the Cu-O bonding would be covalent. However, stabilization of a high-_T__t_ superconductive phase rather than a conventional metal has led us to postulate the existence of a vibronic resonance between the two types of Cu-O bonding with the formation of a correlation-polaron gas above room temperature that condenses below room temperature into a polaron liquid.13 In this paper, we are interested only in the fact that, in a mixed-valent system, a double-well potential can provide a _vibronic_ driving force for the observed phase segregation below room temperature in La2CuO4+_d_. We14,15 have assumed such a driving force exists in our interpretation of the phase diagram for the system La2-_x_Sr_CuO4.

### Ordering of the interstitial oxygen

On the other hand, a conventional structural phase change could also provide the driving force for the phase segregation. The excess oxygen in La2CuO4+_d_ has been located by neutron diffraction;8 it resides in the interstitial position between LaO planes that is coordinated by four La and four apical oxygen atoms. As first demonstrated16 for La2NiO4+_d_, this position is partially occupied in oxygen-excess compounds having the K2NiF4 structure. Evidence for a structural phase change occurring in the interval 0.05 < d < 0.07 comes from samples containing d > 0.05. Such samples have been prepared electrochemically by a method pioneered by Wattiaux _et al._17 A preliminary phase diagram below room temperature has been developed by Grenier _et al._18 This latter study showed a linear decrease with increasing d in the room-temperature orthorhombicity of the structure for d <= 0.05, which is consistent with a random distribution of the excess oxygen in the interstitial sites. The insertion of interstitial oxide ions not only expands the LaO-dO-LaO layers; it also relieves the compressive stress on the CuO2 sheets by oxidizing them, so the tolerance factor t increases and T_{t} decreases with increasing d. On the other hand, the structures for d >= 0.07 show a linear increase with d in the orthorhombicity of the room-temperature structure, which signals that the interstitial oxygen atoms are ordered where d >= 0.07 is found. An increase in the orthorhombicity with d is consistent with the addition of interstitial oxygen in the special positions of the ordered phase. This deduction has been confirmed by neutron-diffraction data, which show superstructure lines indicative of oxygen ordering in samples with d = 0.08 and 0.12.19 Moreover, no evidence of phase segregation has been found above 10 K in samples d > 0.07,19 which shows that the phase with ordered oxygen is stable. Therefore this phase could provide a driving force for the phase segregation observed in the range 0 < d < 0.05.

### The p = \frac{1}{k} phase

In order to determine whether the driving force for the phase segregation below T_{t} observed for 0 < d < 0.05 is vibronic in origin or is due to an ordering of the interstitial oxygen atoms, it is necessary to determine the limiting value d_t_ for the spinodal phase segregation as well as the critical value d_th_ above which the interstitial oxygen atoms are ordered. To date, the range of compositions 0.050 <= d < 0.070 in which d_th_ falls has not been explored. Moreover, this compositional range contains the composition d = 0.0625, which corresponds to p = \frac{1}{k} holes per Cu atom if the interstitial oxygen is present as O2- ions. In the La2-_x_BaCuO4 system, the superconductive phase is completely suppressed at x = \frac{1}{k},20 and below 950degC superconductive samples with 0.13 <= x <= 0.25 in this system are reported21 to phase segregate via La and Ba diffusion into two nonsuperconductive phases: an x = \frac{1}{k} and an overdoped metallic phase. At these temperatures, no structural transition is associated with the phase segregation. A similar stabilization of a nonsuperconductive phase may occur at d = 0.0625 in the system La2CuO4+_d_. Such a phase could provide an _electronic_ driving force for the phase segregation found in the range 0 < d < 0.05.

  Therefore it is also necessary to know both d_{s} and d_{o} relative to d = 0.0625.

### Evidence from neutron diffraction of a d_s_ = 0.05 < d_s_

Chaillout _et al._8 have performed a structural refinement on a single crystal with d = 0.032 to determine the extent of phase segregation at various temperatures down to 15 K. At 15 K, the compound was segregated into the parent phase (d  0) and a superconductive phase with a calculated d_s_  0.048. Moreover, the structure of the d = 0.048 phase was found to be the same as the average orthorhombic structure in the range 0 < d <= 0.05 at room temperature; there was no evidence of ordering of the interstitial oxygen. These data indicate a d_s_(max)  0.050 < d_s__o_, which supports the conclusion that the spinodal phase segregation occurring in the temperature interval 200 < T < 320 K for 0 < d < 0.05 is not due to an ordering of the interstitial oxygen atoms. Moreover, these data indicate a d_s_(max) < 0.0625, which suggests that a _vibronic_ driving force is responsible for the phase segregation rather than either an ordering of the interstitial oxygen atoms O_i_ or an electronic stabilization of a p = \frac{1}{\tau} phase.

### Motivation and strategy of this paper

Our principal motivation for this study was to investigate further the driving force for the static phase segregation occurring in the compositional range 0 < d < 0.05 in the system La2CuO4+_b_. We also wished to explore for evidence of a p = \frac{1}{\tau} phase in the hitherto unexplored compositional range 0.05 < d < 0.07. We monitor the temperature range of any phase segregation that is occurring from the temperature dependences of the resistance and thermoelectric power. From the pressure dependence of T_{c}, we are able to distinguish whether the orthorhombic distortion is due to a cooperative tilting of the CuO6 octahedra or an ordering of the interstitial oxygen atoms. By comparing the transport properties of slow-cooled samples with and without high pressure with those of samples quenched from room temperature to liquid nitrogen, we reinforce the use of transport data to monitor the diffusion-controlled phase segregation.

A related study has been reported by Ahrens _et al._22 for a single composition d = 0.032; these authors used magnetic susceptibility and La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) to probe the phase segregation. They argued, as have we,13 that T_{c} increases with the size of the segregated superconductive domains where the domain size is comparable to the magnetic penetration depth. They found a systematic increase of about 4 K in the bulk critical temperature T_{c} (the transition midpoint) with decreasing anneal temperature T_{a} in the range 200 < T < 300 K. A maximum T_{c} = 29.6 K with a magnetic-susceptibility onset temperature T_{n} = 34 K was reported for T_{a} = 200 K.

To explain our use of the temperature dependences of the Seebeck coefficient a and the resistance R to monitor the temperature range over which phase segregation is occurring, we cite the data of Hundley _et al._23; they have demonstrated that in single-crystal La2CuO4+_b_, d = 0.032, the in-plane resistivity r increases with decreasing temperature over the temperature range of spinodal phase segregation, and the in-plane thermoelectric power a decreases with decreasing temperature. We have noted similar changes in the resistance R and in a in polycrystalline samples of La2CuO4+_b_;18 they provide a definition of the temperature interval over which the static spinodal phase segregation is occurring for different values of d, and we use this criterion in this paper.

Another example where this signature in the transport properties occurs is found in La1,875Ba0.125CuO4, where a low-temperature tetragonal (LTT) phase coexists with the orthorhombic phase in the temperature interval 35 < T < 60 K;20 in this case, static cooperative atomic displacements make visible to diffraction the two distinguishable phases, which probably contain different charge-carrier concentrations. In this case, also, the two-phase region is characterized by a _dR_/_dT_ < 0 and a _da_/_dT_ > 0.

Our final motivation for this study is the need to clarify the situation in the overdoped region d > 0.07. Samples with d >= 0.07 prepared electrochemically have exhibited a step in T_{c} suggestive of the presence of two superconductive phases, one with a T_{c}  36 K and another with a T_{c}  41 K. It is possible that the T_{c}  36 K corresponds to the maximum T_{c} to be associated with the phase containing disordered interstitial oxygen and a T_{c}  41 K corresponds to a phase with completely ordered interstitial oxygen. Samples in the range 0.07 <= d <= 0.12 may be phase segregating at room temperature into domains of ordered interstitial oxygen within a matrix of disordered interstitial oxygen. Such an interpretation has been implied by Johnston _et al._24 in their magnetic investigation of electrochemically prepared La2CuO4+_b_. Alternatively, the step could be a manifestation of vortex motion in the superconductive state just below T_{c}.

## EXPERIMENTAL

Polycrystalline samples were prepared by reacting in air a stoichiometric mixture of the oxides at 1030-1100 degC for 1 week with intermittent grinding. The La2O3 powder was calcined at 980 degC immediately before weighing. Before the final sintering, the powder samples were ground in a milling machine to obtain a finer powder than is obtainable with regular grinding. Sintering just above the reaction temperature of 1050 degC gave a hard, dense pellet. The samples were then oxidized electrochemically at room temperature following the procedure of Wattiaux _et al._17 and Grenier _et al._18 The amount of excess oxygen inserted electrochemically was controlled by the polarization time; however, oxygen evolution is a competitive side reaction, and the final oxidation state was determined by iodometric titration to within an error of better than +-0.01 for d. In our experiments we obtained an accuracy better than +-0.005. The relatively high oxygen mobility at room temperature ensures that homogeneity of the oxygen distribution is obtained at room temperature within a few days. However, for samples 0.047 and 0.066 we inserted the oxygen elec  trochemically at 360 K in order to obtain easier control over the oxygen content. We obtained a d = 0.054 sample at room temperature, but we found it difficult to vary d by small steps at room temperature in the range 0.034 < d < 0.070. At room temperature, the samples were electrochemically oxidized quickly in this region to d = 0.070, which appears to be close to the order-disorder boundary d _d_o. The evolution of properties with d was not influenced by the temperature at which the samples were prepared. All samples were single phase to x-ray diffraction after both sintering and electrochemical oxidation.

Magnetic susceptibility was measured with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. Measurements of the Seebeck coefficient were carried out with a home-made apparatus in which the temperature gradient D_T_ across the sample was carefully controlled. Resistance measurements were made with a four-probe, dc technique; the background potential in the voltage pickup leads was subtracted out. Electrical resistance measurements under nearly hydrostatic pressure were performed with a Be-Cu self-clamping device25 containing a Teflon cell, a lead manometer, and a 1:1 mixture of _n_-pentane and isoamyl alcohol as a pressure-transmitting medium. Indium was first pressed onto the sample surface for electrical contact. Thin copper wire was then pressed into the indium contact with small pieces of indium foil. The sample temperature was measured with a silicon diode attached to a place near the Teflon cell. During a measuring run, the cooling rate was computer controlled to be less than 0.1 K/min.

## RESULTS

Figure 1 shows the Meissner effect for typical samples from three regions of the La2CuO4+d system. The curve for the d = 0.034 sample is similar to that previously reported24 for d = 0.032; that for d = 0.070 has a larger Meissner fraction and a higher T_{c}. Johnston _et al._24 reported the same higher Meissner fraction, but a lower T_{c} = 30 K, whereas Grenier _et al._18 reported two values of T_{c}, one near 40 K and the other near 30 K. We observe a single transition at 40 K. We also find (see below) a jump of 10 K in T_{c} on crossing the composition d_o, where 0.066 < d < 0.070. The literature does not report data for a d = 0.054 sample.

The resistance versus temperature data for different hydrostatic pressures that are displayed in Figs. 2(a)-2(g) were highly reproducible. The high-pressure data were taken on samples that had been cooled slowly down to liquid-He temperatures. In order to clarify how a diffusion-controlled phase segregation occurring between 200 K and room temperature influences the low-temperature (_T_ < 50 K) resistance data, measurements at atmospheric pressure were also carried out on all samples after quenching from room temperature to 77 K. Comparison of the resistance versus temperature curves for the same sample after a slow cool (0.2 K/min) and quenching is presented in the insets of Figs. 2(a)-2(g). Quenching was done by plunging the high-pressure chamber in liquid N2, which lowers the temperature to below 200 K in about 1 min. The total cooling from room temperature to 77 K took about 5 min.

Table I provides information on several critical temperatures extracted from the data of Fig. 2. For samples with 0 < d < 0.070, we distinguish two onset temperatures for a drop in the resistance with decreasing temperature in the range T < 50 K, a T_{d} and a T_{n} where T_{d} > T_{n}. The temperatures T_{d} and T_{n} in Table I correspond to the temperatures at which the slope of the _R_-vs-_T_ curves of Fig. 2 abruptly increases on cooling. Hydrostatic pressure suppresses the resistivity drop at _T__d_; but for pressures P < 10 kbar, a _dT__d_/_dP_ < 0 can be observed. On the other hand band, the onset temperature T_{n} for the superconductive transition increases with pressure and is not suppressed.

The critical temperature T_{c} in Table I is taken as the midpoint of the superconductive transition occurring below _T__on. A _dT__c_/_dP_ > 0 was observed for all samples 0.17 <= d <= 0.054, but its magnitude decreased with increasing d. A _dT__c_/_dP_ < 0 was found for d = 0.066. The temperature for onset of zero resistance also had a pressure dependence _dT__o_/_dP_ > 0 for d = 0.017 and 0.034; it vanished for d = 0.054. In contrast, samples with d >= 0.070 had no T_{d} anomaly and a _dT__c_/_dP_ = _dT__on_/_dP_ > 0.06 K/kbar, a value lower than the 0.11 K/kbar found10 for the orthorhombic superconductor La1.85F0.15CuO4.

The increase in resistance with decreasing temperature in the range 200 < T < 300 K observed at atmospheric pressure for slowly cooled samples correlates with the temperature domain where diffusion of the interstitial oxygen atoms has been shown to create a classic spinodal phase segregation. This feature is found in the _R_-vs-_T_ curves of all samples 0.017 <= d <= 0.054 slow cooled at atmospheric pressure, but it is not prominent in the d = 0.047 and 0.054 samples. Although this feature is not observed in sample 0.066 and is only weakly so in 0.047 and 0.054, the change in low-temperature resistance of these samples on quenching from room temperature to 77 K demonstrates that some oxygen movement occurs below room temperature in these samples also. We con

  clude from the quenching experiments that the interstitial oxygen atoms are mobile and induce phase segregation below room temperature in all samples investigated throughout the compositional range 0<8\leq 0.066, but for \delta\geq 0.070 the interstitial oxygen atoms do not move during cooling, as is confirmed by the absence of any difference in transport properties of the quenched and slow-cooled samples [see Figs 2(f) and 2(g)]. This observation tells us that the system is thermodynamically stable for \delta\geq 0.070 since the O_{i} atoms are still mobile at room temperature.

Figure 3 compares the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient \alpha and the resistance R for the \delta=0.017 and 0.070 samples; the former is representative of samples 8=0.017 and 0.032, the latter of samples \delta\geq 0.070. A decrease in \alpha and an increase in R with decreasing T are found for the \delta=0.017 sample in the range 200<T<300 K where phase segregation is known to be occurring by oxygen diffusion. As mentioned above, this feature in \alpha and R is characteristic of a temperature interval of phase segregation, not only in this system, but also in La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4}; it is not found in the \delta=0.070 sample where there is no evidence of oxygen mobility. However, the \delta=0.070 sample exhibits a step in the resistance drop at T_{c}; this step is found in all samples \delta\geq 0.070 and is the same as that reported by Grenier _et al._[18]. The transition above this step is seen to increase with pressure; however, the R-vs-T curve is less sensitive to pressure for temperatures below this step, the temperature of essentially zero resistance changing little with pressure [see Figs. 2(f) and 2(g)].

Figure 4 compares the resistance drop with decreasing temperature at T_{d}\approx 47 K in the \delta=0.054 sample with the drop at T_{\rm on}=43 K in the \delta=0.070 sample. The thermopower voltage V(T) is measured relative to a temperature of 50 K fixed on one side of the sample; the temperature T on the other side was controlled to scan the temperature region of interest. In Fig. 4, the Seebeck coefficient \alpha was taken as the slope of the plot of thermopotential V versus T. The width of the resistivity and susceptibility transitions is somewhat broader than is found in the La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system, but it is similar to that found by others in the La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} system for the same values of \delta[18, 24].

In the sample \delta=0.054, changes in d\alpha/dT occur at both T_{d} and T_{\rm on}, \alpha falling to zero below T_{0}. A Meissner diamagnetism only sets in at temperatures T<T_{\rm on}=35 K, which is well separated from T_{d}\approx 47 K. No super

  conductive transition is to be associated with T_{d}. The same is true for all samples 0.017 \leq 8 \leq 0.066. In a magnetic field H = 0.1 T, the magnetic susceptibility shows a small decrease setting in below T_{d}, but there is no Meissner diamagnetism.

In the sample \delta = 0.070, on the other hand, the Seebeck coefficient drops to zero and a Meissner signal sets in below the first drop in resistance with decreasing temperature; it therefore marks an onset temperature T_{\rm on} = 43 K for superconductivity. However, an anomalous "tail" in the R-vs-T curve persists into the superconductive temperature range where \alpha = 0. This "tail" gives rise to the step in R vs T at T_{c} discussed above in connection with Fig. 3. The presence of this step has suggested the existence of a second superconductive phase corresponding to \delta = 0.11,[18, 24] but an alternate interpretation is the prediction of Levi[26] that the high-T_{c} superconductors contain vortices in a liquid state to give a nonzero resistance even in the absence of an applied magnetic field. In our sample, the Meissner effect shows a single phase (Fig. 1), and we believe the latter interpretation applies in our case.

The feature characteristic of phase segregation appearing above 200 K in the R-vs-T curve for slow-cooled samples 0 \leq 8 \leq 0.054 (with the exception of \delta = 0.047 and 0.066) is increasingly suppressed by hydrostatic pressures (see Fig. 2). We conclude that hydrostatic pressure inhibits diffusion of the interstitial oxygen below room temperature.

An analogous increase in resistance with decreasing temperature occurs in all samples 0.017 \leq 8 \leq 0.066 below 100 K; a decrease in \alpha with decreasing temperature is also found in the same temperature interval. Unlike the similar feature in the range 200 < T < 300 K, this feature occurring below 100 K in La_{2}CuO_{4 + \delta} is not suppressed either by quenching to 77 K from room temperature or by hydrostatic pressure; it is not associated with a diffusion-controlled phase segregation. A similar phenomenon is found in the La_{2 - x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system for x \leq 0.10; we have interpreted it to signal the presence of charge fluctuations induced by cooperative, dynamic atomic displacements associated with a dynamic resonance between covalent and ionic equilibrium Cu-O bond lengths.[13] This feature is essentially absent in samples with \delta \geq 0.070. The resistance deviates from a linear dependence only just above T_{c} in the samples \delta \geq 0.070, the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient \alpha is totally different from that for \delta = 0.019.

Finally, the sample with \delta = 0.047, Fig. 2(c), exhibited a negative resistance just above T_{0}. The effect was highly reproducible for several different specimens cut from the same sample; it was found both after quenching under 1 bar and on the application of hydrostatic pressure, but was essentially absent in the sample slow cooled at atmospheric pressure. A very careful measurement of \alpha vs T showed that \alpha \neq 0 in the temperature range where the negative resistance occurs. Although pressure might cause the pressure-transmitting medium to become solid at low temperatures and to induce a shear stress on the sample, this explanation would not apply to the quenched sample; we rule it out. The four-probe configuration was not exactly the same as in the van der Pauw method. However, the origin of the negative resistance was not due to our experimental technique, but to something intrinsic to this sample. With the same experimental system, we have carried out extensive measurements on La_{2 - x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} without encountering such an anomaly.[10] Normally, a fixed current establishes a distribution of equipotential lines in the sample that is invariant with temperature in a single-phase sample; only the voltage gradient changes. In this sample, the equipotential pattern must change with temperature just above T_{0} so as to give rise to a crossing of the voltages at the two leads. A possible cause for such a crossing is the appearance of a phase inhomogeneity just above T_{0} such as might be introduced by charge fluctuations.

## Discussions

### T_{s} vs \delta

The available data are summarized in the phase diagram of Fig. 5. We begin our discussion of it with the

Figure 4: Temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient \alpha, the resistance R, and the dc magnetization M in a field of 10 G for \delta = 0.054 and 0.070.

  temperature T_{s} below which a diffusion-controlled phase segregation sets in.

The T_{s} for \delta\!\approx\!0.03 has been reported to fall in the range 290\!\leq\!T_{s}\!\leq\!320 K.[6, 7, 8] No detectable interstitial oxygen was found in the antiferromagnetic parent phase at low \delta; the concentration of this parent phase increases with lowering temperature, but there is no evidence of a change in composition, which indicates a \delta\!\approx\!0 for all temperatures T\!<\!T_{s} in this phase. On the other hand, the evolution of lattice parameters with temperature[6]^{-}[8] clearly indicates that the high-\delta phase below T_{s} for \delta\!=\!0.03 contains increasing concentrations of oxygen as the temperature is lowered to 200 K. Neutron-diffraction data from a \delta\!=\!0.032 sample[6] show, for example, an abrupt change in the thermal-expansion coefficient at 200 K in the oxygen-rich phase, but no change in thermal expansion of the parent phase. The T_{s}-vs-\delta points shown in Fig. 5 were calculated by us from the temperature variation of the fraction of parent phase reported in the literature.[8] A dT_{s}/d\delta\!<\!0 is clearly indicated.

A recent publication[27] gives a somewhat different phase diagram than that shown in Fig. 5. It is based on neutron-diffraction data for a \delta\!=\!0.032 sample that contradicts the earlier work.[6] The "lever rule" was used for three different compositions to locate a parent-phase boundary near \delta\!=\!0.01 and a superconductive-phase boundary near \delta\!=\!0.055. Within the titration error \pm 0.005 for \delta, the high-\delta boundary is similar to ours. We apply the "lever rule" with the assumption that the limit of the parent phase is \delta\!=\!0 on the earlier neutron-diffraction results.[6] We believe that Fig. 5 represents a more realistic phase diagram, but undoubtedly the parent phase has a finite, though small, limiting value of \delta.

### The superconductive phase at \delta\!=\!\delta,

With 290\!\leq\!T_{s}\!\leq\!320 K, some phase segregation occurs already at room temperature in samples with \delta\!=\!0.03. Consequently Ahrens _et al.[22]_ found that a \delta\!=\!0.032 sample quenched from room temperature to 5 K was superconductive with a T_{c}\!=\!25.6 K. Sufficient phase segregation had taken place at room temperature that the \delta-rich phase at ambient conditions becomes superconductive. Since the \delta-rich phase shows no evidence of an ordering of the interstitial oxygen, we conclude that the driving force for phase segregation is not structural; it is either vibronic or electronic. Since the \delta-rich phase is superconductive, the driving force is not an electronic stabilization of a p\!=\!\frac{1}{\delta} phase, which is not superconductive. The data are therefore consistent with a vibronic stabilization of a superconductive phase that, below 300 K, is thermodynamically distinguishable from the antiferromagnetic parent phase.[15, 18]

Ahrens _et al.[22]_ then annealed at temperatures T_{a}\!\leq\!250 K the \delta\!=\!0.032 sample that had been quenched into liquid He from room temperature. After each anneal, the sample was again quenched into liquid He. The superconductive critical temperature T_{c} increased as T was raised, reaching a maximum of 29.6 K for T_{a}\!=\!200 K. The increase in T_{c} requires mobility of the O_{i}; the equilibrium distribution only occurs for T\!\geq\!200 K. Over the range 200\!\leq\!T_{a}\!\leq\!250 K, T_{c} decreased monotonically, extrapolating to 25.6 K for a room-temperature anneal. Since \delta_{s} increases with decreasing T, these data indicate that the high-\delta phase is underdoped with respect to the optimum oxidation of the CuO_{2} sheets, which would account for an increase in T_{c} with \delta_{s} in the \delta-rich phase.

### The Neel temperature

**Whereas stoichiometric La_{2}CuO_{4} has a T_{N}\!\approx\!320 K,[28] the Neel temperature of the antiferromagnetic phase at the limiting composition of the parent compound remains at T_{N}\!\approx\!250 K to \delta\!\approx\!0.03.[24] The reduction in T_{N} from 320 to 250 K probably signals the presence of a \delta\!>\!0 too small to be detected by neutron diffraction in the low-\delta phase; it may also reflect internal strains associated with the coexistence of two phases created by diffusion below room temperature. We indicate in Fig. 5 a \delta\!\approx\!0 for the parent phase, but 250\!<\!T_{N}\!<\!320 K within this phase. For \delta\!\geq\!0.047, we found no evidence for long-range magnetic order; any parent phase \delta\!\approx\!0 has been reduced by \delta\!=\!0.047 to too small a concentration to be detected at a \delta\!\approx\!\delta_{s}(max).**

T_{s} and T_{t} lines were derived from data of Refs. [8] and [24].

### Location of d d _d_ s _d_

For d < d d, the orthorhombic distortion at lower temperatures is due to a cooperative rotation of the CuO6 octahedra that relieves the internal stresses associated with bond-length mismatch. The orthorhombic-tetragonal transition temperature T_{t} decreases with increasing d in the range d <= d <= d 0.05 because the tolerance factor t of Eq. (1) increases with d where the interstitial oxygen atoms Oi are randomly distributed between pairs of LaO planes.12,18 The Oi2-ions relieve the tensile stress in the LaO-dOiLaO layers, and oxidation of the CuO2 sheets reduces the mean equilibrium Cu-O bond length.

An observed increase with d in the room-temperature orthorhombicity for d >= 0.070 is reflected in Fig. 5 by an undetermined (because of oxygen loss at T > 300 K) orthorhombic-tetragonal transition temperature _T__t_' increasing with d. In this compositional range, the orthorhombic distortion is due to an ordering of the interstitial oxygen atoms; the CuO2 planes remain flat in this orthorhombic phase.19 A d d falling in the range 0.066 < d d < 0.070 is indicated by the disappearance of any evidence of phase segregation in samples d >= 0.070. This deduction is also consistent with the _dT__c_ /_dP_ data of Table I, which are discussed below.

### Oxidation state of the interstitial oxygen

The _R_-vs-_T_ and _a_-vs-_T_ curves of Fig. 3 for d = 0.070 are similar to those found for x = 0.14 in La2-xSrCuO4; they are characteristic of an optimally doped copper oxide superconductor.15 The similarity in magnitude of a and shape of a vs T for those samples indicates a hole concentration per Cu atom in each of p = 0.14, which would seem to confirm the hypothesis that below room temperature the interstitial oxygen is present as Oi2-ions for d = 0.070.

A small, if any, change in T_{c} and the magnitude of a between d = 0.070 and d = 0.090 was previously interpreted18 to mean that, for d > 0.070, the LaO-dOi-LaO layers act as charge reservoirs because they have O-2p states that overlap the Fermi energy E_{F}. However, Table I indicates a definite decrease in T_{c} from 40.4 K for d = 0.070 to 37.8 K for d = 0.095. These values of T_{c} are compatible with the flat maximum in T_{c} vs x found in the range 0.14 <= x <= d 0.19 for La2-xSrCuO4 where, without question, p = x for a stoichiometric oxygen concentration O4 per formula unit.10 Therefore the data of Table I give no compelling reason to believe the interstitial oxygen enter as anything other than Oi2- ions over the entire compositional range d >= 0.070, particularly as _dT__c_/_dP_ s = 0.065 K/kbar for d >= 0.070 is relatively small. Pressure generally alters the distribution of holes between a reservoir and the CuO2 sheets so as to alter _dT__c_/_dP_ significantly. On the other hand, _dT__c_/_dP_ = 0 is found for flat CuO2 planes in La2-xSrCuO4 10 and the large a does not decrease on increasing d from 0.070 to 0.095 as would be expected for a large statistical contribution to the Seebeck coefficient; a d _a_/_dx_ < 0 occurs in La2-xSrCuO4 on going from x = 0.14 to 0.18. The availability of a charge reservoir remains a distinct possibility for d > 0.070.

In the compositional range d < 0.070, the introduction of Oi atoms clearly oxidizes the CuO2 sheets; it appears they enter as Oi2- ions at lower concentrations. However, evidence for some charge transfer between the interstitial oxygen and the CuO2 sheets can be found in the electronic behavior at T_{d}, a transition that we associate with the "_p_ = 1/2 " phase. The Seebeck coefficient drops on lowering the temperature through T_{d}, which is consistent with a higher hole concentration in the CuO2 sheets at temperatures T < T_{d}.

The layered structure of La2CuO4 supports strong internal electric fields associated with formal charges 2 + and 2 - for the alternating (LaO)2 and CuO2 layers. These fields favor stabilization of Oi2- ions within the rocksalt LaO-Oi-LaO layers; incorporation of Oi2- ions lowers the formal charges of the layers to (2 - 28) + and (2 - 28) -, which lowers the probability of electron capture by the Oi atoms as d increases. Ordering of the interstitial oxygen at d = 0.070 apparently stabilizes electron capture at Oi2- ions; in the disordered phase the transfer of electrons from the CuO2 sheets to the Oi2- ions appears to be less stable as d increases. We attribute the peculiar experimental difficulty in obtaining electrochemically compositions in the range 0.035 < d < 0.070 to this phenomenon.

### Origin of the step at T_{c} for d >= 0.07

Although we are unable to determine from our experiments whether the LaO-dOi-LaO layers are acting as a charge reservoir in the range d >= 0.070, nevertheless the step in the _R_-vs-_T_ curve at T_{c} found in the range d >= 0.070 can be attributed to liquid-state vortices rather than the presence of a second phase since the step gives an anomalous "tail" in the _R_-vs-_T_ curve that extends into the superconductive temperature range where a = 0.

### The transition at T_{l}

Above a temperature T_{l}, where 300 <= T_{l} < 500 K, the system La2-xSrCuO4 shows a complete solid solution over the entire compositional range 0 <= x <= 0.34. The _R_-vs-_T_ curve for T > T_{l} changes gradually with increasing x from weakly concave to the temperature axis in the underdoped samples to a _T__l_' dependence in the overdoped samples; y increases with x from y = 1.0 to y = 1.4 in the overdoped samples.29 Below T_{l}, the _a_-vs-_T_ and _R_-vs-_T_ curve show a marked transition on passing from the underdoped compositions 0 < x <= 0.10 to the optimally doped compositions 0.14 <= x <= 0.20. Whereas a is essentially temperature independent down to a T_{p} <= 150 K in the underdoped samples, the characteristic feature of the _a_-vs-_T_ curves for the optimally doped samples is a transition to a temperature dependence below T_{l} that exhibits a pronounced maximum, having a shape suggestive of the addition of a giant mass enhancement of the transport term. In these samples; R increases linearly with T below T_{l}. We have interpreted this behavior to be indicative of a _correlation-polaron gas_ above T_{l} for all compositions 0 < x < 0.34 that condenses below T_{l} into a _polaron liquid_ having a stable compositional range 0.14 <= x <= 0.20.13 Since p = x in the La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 system for a stoichiometric oxygen content, we can expect the La2CuO4+ system to exhibit the same _a_-_vs_-_T_ and _R_-_vs_-_T_ behavior in the range 0.07 <= d <= 0.11 if the interstitial oxygen is present as O_i_2- ions. The curves for d=0.070 shown in Fig. 2 are similar to those for x = 0.14 in La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4; however, they are restricted to T < 300 K because of problems with loss of oxygen at higher temperatures. A possible change of slope in the _a_-_vs_-_T_ curve at a T_{l}  300 K is just discernible.

### Indirect evidence for charge fluctuations in La2CuO4+_d

According to the correlation-polaron model, underdoped samples in the range 0 < p < 0.10 become metastable below 300 K with respect to a phase segregation into the parent and supeconductive phases. In La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4, conventional segregation into hole-rich and hole-poor domains is prevented by lack of a mobile ion; segregation only occurs below a T_{p}  150 K via cooperative atomic displacements that, because of vibronic coupling, remain dynamic and therefore result in charge fluctuations.

A d_d_d_(max)  0.05 at T <= 200 K in Fig. 5 for La2CuO4+_d_ corresponds to a hole concentration per Cu in the CuO2 sheets of p = 0.10 if all the O_i_ atoms are present as O_i_2- ions. A p  0.10 still lies within the range of underdoped samples if optimum doping is restricted to 0.14 <= p <= 0.20. It is therefore legitimate to ask why d_d_s does not mark the boundary of optimum doping if the driving force for phase segregation is indeed stabilization of the superconductive phase. We answer that question qualitatively by noting that Coulombic repulsions between O_i_2- ions as well as the local lattice deformation around each O_i_2- ion resist stabilization of a higher-d phase with disordered O_i_2- ions. This resistance accounts for a _dT__s_/_d_d_d_d_ < 0 in Fig. 5. Were the O_i_ atoms mobile at T < 200 K, a d_d_s_(max) > 0.05 could be expected.

The signature for the onset of charge fluctuations below a T_{p}  150 K in underdoped La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 is a _dR_/_dT_ < 0 and a _d_a_/_dT_ > 0 in the range T_{c} < T < T, a behavior like that occurring in the interval 200 < T < 300 K in La2CuO4+_d_ for 0 < _d_d_s_ < 0.05. The appearance of the characteristic signature _d_a_/_dT_ > 0 and _dR_/_dT_ < 0 below 100 K for all samples 0.017 <= 0.066, but not for d >= 0.070, despite a static phase segregation to d = 0 and d_d_s_ <= 0.05 in samples 0 < d < 0.05, would therefore indicate that charge fluctuations persist in the interval T_{c} < T < T, for 0.050 <= _d_s_ < 0.070. This conclusion appears surprising; however, the situation is made more complex by the insertion of a d=0.0625 phase, corresponding to p = \frac{1}{k} lying within the range 0.10 < p < 0.14. The insertion of this phase introduces the possibility of an electronically driven phase separation at low temperatures and also allows the evidence for a diffusion-controlled segregation via mobile O_i_2- ions in the d=0.054 and 0.066 samples to be reconciled with the _T__s_-_s_-d curve of Fig. 5 obtained from neutron-diffraction data.

### The p = \frac{1}{k} phase

With a d_d_s_(max)  0.05 and a 0.066 < d_d_0 < 0.070, we need to ask what is happening in the range d_d_s_ < d_d_d_d_. To answer this question, we monitor (a) the variation with d of T0, the temperature below which the resistance vanishes, (b) the evidence for a diffusion-controlled process occurring near room temperature in this compositional range, and (c) the temperature variation of R and a below 150 K that we have interpreted elsewhere to signal the onset of charge fluctuations.

From Table I, we see that the slow-cooled samples all have a T = 26 K for 0 < 6 < 0.05, which would indicate a common value of d for the superconductive phase segregated out at d_d_s_(max)  0.05. On the other hand, T0 goes through a minimum in the interval 0.054 < d < 0.066. This behavior is analogous to the suppression of T_{c} at p = \frac{1}{k}, corresponding to d=0.0625, that has been well established for the system La2-_x_Ba_CuO4 at x = p = \frac{1}{k}. (A similar suppression of T_{c} may also occur near x = \frac{1}{k} in a well-homogenized La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 system.30) We are led to conclude that a similar nonsuperconductive phase is being stabilized near d=0.0625 in the La2CuO4+_d_ system and that stabilization of this phase is _electronically_ driven. The transition at d_d_s_ is _structurally_ driven, and the phase segregation between the parent compound and the superconductive phase at d_d_s_(max) has been postulated by us to be _vibronically_ driven.

The p = \frac{1}{k} phase may be stable above 300 K, as is demonstrated in La1.84Ba0.16CuO4 by the phase segregation below 950 degC into two nonsuperconductive phases: one at p = \frac{1}{k} and the other an overdoped metallic phase with p > 0.25.31 Evidence for a diffusion-controlled phase segregation in the d=0.054 and 0.066 samples would then be interpretable in the former as a phase segregation below T_{l} between a p = \frac{1}{k} phase and a polaron-liquid superconductive phase at lower (d  0.05) and, in the latter, between a p = \frac{1}{k} phase and an O_i_-ordered superconductive phase at higher (d  0.070) values of d.

Segregation of the d=0.054 sample into a superconductive p  0.10 and a p = \frac{1}{k} phase cannot be driven by the order-disorder transition of the interstitial oxygen since we found 0.066 < d_s_ < 0.070. Moreover, only relatively small changes in the oxygen distribution are evident between the slow-cooled and the quenched samples or after cooling under pressure; the principal phase segregation appears to occur below T_{p}, which is consistent with an electronic stabilization of a nonsuperconductive p = \frac{1}{k} phase that competes with a vibronically stabilized superconductive phase.

### Effect of pressure

Hydrostatic pressure suppresses the resistive anomaly at _T__d_s 47 K that is found in all samples 0.017 <= d <= 0.066, but not for d >= 0.070. This transition  is not superconductive. The drop in a with decreasing T at T_{c} begins at a T_{f} >= _T_on below which Cooper-pair fluctuations occur; the drop in a with decreasing T at T_{d} occurs at the temperature T_{d} of the resistive drop. No superconductive pair fluctuations are associated with T_{d}.

Pressure reduces the anomaly in the _R_-vs-_T_ curves of Figs. 2(a)-2(d) in the range 200 < T < 300 K, which indicates that pressure suppresses the _O__i_-atom diffusion. The suppression of T_{d}, but not T_{s}, with hydrostatic pressure shows that the anomaly at T_{s} is independent of O__i_-atom diffusion whereas T_{d} may be associated with the diffusion-controlled phase segregation. In the d = 0.066 sample, suppression of the O__i_-atom diffusion by pressure results in a broadening of the superconductive transition over the interval 16-40 K. Since T_{d} is suppressed by quenching [see Fig. 2(a), for example], as well as by pressure, we are led to conclude that T_{d} is associated with the static component of the phase segregation to p = 1/2.

We discuss the pressure effect on T_{c}, _dT__c_/_dP_ of Table I, within the context of the effect found for the system La2-Sr2CuO4 where a _dT__c_/_dP_  0.11 K/kbar occurring in the orthorhombic phase at x  0.15 becomes _dT__c_/_dP_  0 in the tetragonal phase.10 In the tetragonal phase, the Cu-O-Cu bond angle in the CuO2 sheets is 180deg; in the orthorhombic phase, a cooperative tilting of the CuO6 octahedra reduces this angle, so we associate a _dT__c_/_dP_ > 0 in La2-Sr2CuO4 with the deformation of the CuO2 sheets by octahedral-site tilting. In La2CuO4+_b_, there are two distinguishable orthorhombic phases denoted O1 and _O_II in Fig. 5. In the O1 phase, the O_{i} atoms are disordered and at 15 K the CuO6 octahedra are tilted as in the orthorhombic phase of the system La2-_x_Sr2CuO4; in the _O_II phase the O_{i} atoms are ordered and at 4 K the CuO6 octahedra are not tilted.19 Therefore, in the absence of charge transfer between the CuO2 sheets and a charge reservoir in the nonsuperconductive layers, the value of _dT__c_/_dP_ can distinguish between an O1 and an _O_II orthorhombic phase.

The application of pressure at room temperature inhibits, but does not suppress totally, further phase segregation below room temperature (see Fig. 1) in the range 0 < d < 0.05. The decrease in _dT__c_/_dP_ from 0.29 K/kbar for d = 0.34 to 0.13 K/kbar for d = 0.054 is consistent with an increase with d in the Cu-O-Cu bond angle within the CuO2 sheets to a value similar to that found for La1,85Sr0,15CuO4. The low valence _dT__c_/_dP_ = 0.073 K/kbar found for d = 0.017 would then be consistent with the increase in T_{c} relative to T0 in this sample as a result of internal stresses in the sample. In the _O_II phase found for d >= 0.07, where the Cu-O-Cu bond angles are 180deg, a _dT__c_/_dP_  0 may reflect charge transfer between La-8O_i_-LaO charge-reservoir layers and the CuO2 sheets. This latter question remains open, especially as hydrostatic pressure has essentially no effect on T0 for d >= 0.07. A _dT__c_/_dP_ < 0 for d = 0.066 is consistent with an inhibition of the static component of the segregation between the p  1/2 and superconductive d  0.07 phases in this sample.

Finally, the origin of the negative resistance observed just above T0 in the d = 0.047 sample after quenching or under pressure remains unresolved. We simply note here that d = 0.047 is at the upper boundary d_{s}  0.05 for diffusion-controlled phase segregation.

## Conclusions

From the experiments reported in this paper, we draw the following conclusions.

(1) In the system La2CuO4+_b_, the d interstitial oxygen atoms O_i_ per formula unit enter the La2CuO4 host structure as O_i_2- ions for smaller values of d, but in the range 0.054 <= d <= 0.066 there may be some electron transfer from the O_i_2- ions to the LaO2 sheets above a transition temperature T_{d} within a "_p_ = 1/2" phase. The extraordinary mobility (mobile down to 200 K) of the interstitial oxygen atoms suggests that the charge-transfer reaction

\[\delta{\text{O}}_{i}^{2 - } + ({\text{CuO}}_{2})^{(2 - 28) - } = 8{\text{O}}_{i}^{ - } + ({\text{CuO}}_{2})^{(2 - 8) - }\]

is not biased too strongly to the left, which allows oxygen diffusion to a neighboring site to be facilitated by an in-transit charge transfer. Ordering of the O_i_ at d = 0.070 appears to stabilize the left-hand side of reaction (2) relative to the right-hand side.

(2) An order-disorder transition of the O_i_ atoms occurs at a composition d_o_, where 0.066 < d_o_ < 0.070. The ordered phase has a T_{c} some 10 K higher than the disordered phase.

In the ordered phase, some O _2p_ states of the nonsuperconductive LaO-8O_i_-LaO layers may lie above E_{F} to make these layers act as "charge-reservoirs" vis a vis the CuO2 planes via the charge-transfer reaction of Eq. (2); but the small value of _dT__c_/_dP_ for d >= 0.070 suggests that any such charge transfer remains relatively small.

(3) In samples d >= 0.070, the "tail" in the _R_-vs-_T_ curve extending below T_{c}, as determined by a = 0, is to be attributed to liquid-state vortices.

(4) Below a critical temperature T_{s} = T_{s}(d), where _dT__s_/_d_d_ < 0, a diffusion-controlled phase segregation occurs in the temperature range 200 K < T < T_{s} where the O_i_ atoms are mobile. For a fixed d, the fraction of parent phase with d >= 0 and T_{N}  250 K (reduced from a maximum T_{N}  320 K in La2CuO4) grows with decreasing temperature as the oxygen content d_s_ of the d-rich phases increases to d_s_ (max)  0.05 at T_{s}  200 K.

(5) A d_o_ > d_s_(max) shows that the driving force for the phase segregation in the range 0 < d < 0.05 is not stabilization of a phase with ordered interstitial oxygen; the driving force is not structural, but of electronic or vibronic origin. The electronic normal state of the superconductive phase is thermodynamically distinguishable from the antiferromagnetic state of the parent phase.

(6) A competitive phase, distinguishable from the two superconductive phases stable at d >= 0.05 and d >= 0.070, is stable within the narrow compositional range 0.054 < d < 0.066, which lies in the domain of the disordered O1 structural phase field. The decrease in T_{c} to a minimum value within this narrow compositional range indicates that the competitive phase is most probably the nonsuperconductive p = 1/2 phase, which would appear as  a line phase at \delta  0.0625.

(7) A subtle transition appearing at T_{d}  47 K over the range 0\!<\!\delta\!<\!0.070 is nonsuperconductive and is suppressed by the application of hydrostatic pressure. This transition appears to be associated with the nonsuperconductive (p\!=\!\frac{1}{\delta}) competitive phase; it may represent a charge-transfer transition between the O_{i}^{-}/O_{i}^{2-} redox couple and the CuO_{2} planes.

(8) It is possible to monitor known phase segregations by observing changes in the temperature dependences of the resistance R and the Seebeck coefficient \alpha. Such monitoring showed that application of hydrostatic pressure suppresses the mobility of the O_{i} atoms. It also revealed an O_{i}-diffusion phase segregation occurring near room temperature in the narrow compositional range 0.054\!\leq\!\delta\!\leq\!0.066. The latter finding is consistent with a competitive line phase near \delta\!=\!0.0625 that is stable to above room temperature; segregation between it and the \delta\!=\!0.05 superconductive phase would then occur below T_{l} for 0.05\!<\!\delta\!<\!0.0625 and between it and the superconductive O_{\rm II} phase at \delta_{o} for 0.0625\!<\!\delta\!<\!\delta_{o}.

(9) The temperature dependences of R and \alpha below 150 K show anomalies consistent with the appearance of charge fluctuations in the interval T_{c}<T\!<\!T_{\rho}. We interpret this indirect evidence for the onset of charge fluctuations as a further manifestation of the influence of an electronically stabilized competitive (p\!=\!\frac{1}{\delta}) phase.

(10) The evolutions with 8 and T of R and \alpha in La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} are consistent with their evolutions with x and T in the system La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} if provision is made for the diffusion-controlled phase segregations occurring in the range T\!>\!200 K.

The indirect evidence for charge fluctuations in the range T_{c}\!<\!T\!<\!T_{\rho} for 0\!<\!\delta\!<\!\delta_{o} supports our earlier model [13] that the uniqueness of the normal state of the superconductive phase is the condensation of a correlation-polaron gas into a polaron liquid.

Samples of La2CuO4+-d in the range 0<d<0.1 were prepared by electrochemical insertion of oxygen in KOH; the oxygen content was determined by iodometric titration. The temperature variations of resistance R and Seeback coefficient a were used to monitor as a function of the compositional parameter d not only the evolution of the superconductive transition temperature _Tc_, but also the diffusion-controlled spinodal phase segregation occurring in the temperature range 200<_T_ <= 300 K. The data also show that the 8 interstitial oxygen atoms O1 per formula unit enter as O12 ions at least in the range 0<_d_ <= 0.070. Comparison of the transport properties of samples slow-cooled from room temperature to 77 K reveals an O1-atom segregation over the range 0<_d_ <= 0.066; this segregation disappears for d>d_d_, where the O1 atoms become ordered, and 0.066<d_0.070 was determined. Analysis of neutron-diffraction data from available literature gives a spinodal decomposition temperature T_{t} vs d that falls to 200 K at d_t_(max)=0.05; the diffusion-controlled spinodal phase segregation occurs within the phase field of the O1-disordered orthorhombic structure. The oxygen-rich phase having d_t_,(max)=0.05 is superconductive with a zero-resistance temperature T0=26 K that is lower than the T0=32 K observed for d>d_d_0; _Tc_ falls to a minimum near d=0.0625 within the compositional range d_t_,(max)<d<d_0, which suggests the presence of a competitive nonsuperconductive line phase near p = 1/2 holes per Cu atom as is found in the La2-_x_Ba2CuO4 system near x = 1/2. A nonsuperconductive transition at T_{d} = 47+-1 K was found in slow-cooled samples over the range 0<d<d_0; it is suppressed by both high pressure and the quenching procedure. We associate it with the competitive nonsuperconductive phase stabilized near p = 1/2. In the ordered-O1 phase found for d>d_0, a "tail" in the _R_-vs_-_T_ curve extends into the superconductive temperature range where _a_=0; it is attributed to a liquid-vortex state rather than a second superconductive phase. The pressure dependences of _Tc_ and the O1-atom mobility were used to distinguish the superconductive phases found for d<d_0 and d>d_0. The appearance of a nonsuperconductive line phase in the interval d_t_(max)<d<d_0 permits reconciliation of the data, including indirect evidence for charge fluctuations stabilized below a T_{P} < 150 K in this interval. The indirect evidence for charge fluctuations is the same as that discussed by us elsewhere in the framework of a model developed for the system La2-_x_Sr2CuO4.

## INTRODUCTION

As early as 1987, filamentary superconductivity was discovered in ceramic samples of La2CuO4 that had been slow cooled in air from the sintering temperature.1,2 This procedure loads the structure with excess oxygen to yield La2CuO4+-d with a maximum d=0.02.

In order to explore this phenomenon further, samples were loaded to higher values of d with high oxygen pressures,3-5 and a spinodal phase segregation into an oxygen-rich superconductive phase and an oxygen-poor antiferromagnetic phase was shown to occur below a temperature T_{t}.6 Neutron-diffraction studies6-8 performed on d=0.03 samples prepared under a _P_O2=3 kbar have given a range 290<_T__s_ <= 320 K for the onset temperature for phase segregation and a T_{t}  430 K for the orthorhombic-tetragonal transition in the single-phase region. They also indicated that the oxygen-poor, antiferromagnetic phase that initially appears on cooling is essentially the parent compound La2CuO4; its concentration increases with decreasing temperature whereas the oxygen parameter d_s_ of the superconductive phase increases with decreasing temperature. The phase segregation occurs via a diffusion of the oxygen atoms, and surprisingly these remain mobile down to about 200 K.8,9 Identification of the driving force for the observed segregation into a superconductive phase and the parent antiferromagnetic-insulator phase could prove critical to our understanding of the superconductive phase. Two alternatives need to be distinguished: (1) an electronic character of the normal state that makes the superconductive phase thermodynamically distinguishable from both the parent antiferromagnetic phase and the overdoped metallic phase and (2) an ordering of the interstitial oxygen in the superconductive phase. In order to distinguish between these alternatives, it is necessary to investigate systematically the compositional range 0.05<_d_ < 0.07, a range that has been absent from previous studies. However, this range may be complicated by the appearance of a competitive, nonsuperconductive phase appearing near the composition d=0.0625, which corresponds to p = 1/2 holes per Cu atom.

## A thermodynamically distinguishable normal state

Whereas the d=0.03 samples retain their excess oxygen at atmospheric pressure to 489 K (Ref. 6), samples d  0.05 prepared at higher _P_O2 begin to lose oxygen above room temperature.5 All samples with d  0.03 exhibit a first-order phase change with loss of oxygen above 225 degC at atmospheric pressure.5,7 For the d  0.05 sample T_{t} is lowered to near room temperature, and a discontinuous increase in the room-temperature Cu-O bond length in the CuO2 sheets was noted after traversing the first-order phase change with loss of oxygen near 225 degC; this increase in bond length was interpreted to indicate that a discontinuous increase in the equilibrium Cu-O bond length occurs on changing from a more covalent to an ionic character of the Cu-O bond.5 A discontinuous change in bond character implies a double-well potential for the Cu-O bond at the crossover from ionic to covalent bonding. One consequence of such a double-well potential would be a stabilization by high pressure of the tetragonal relative to the orthorhombic phase, i.e., a _dT__t_/_dP_ < 010, and this pressure dependence of T_{t} has been observed.11 The orthorhombic-tetragonal distortion at a transition temperature T_{t} is due to a mismatch of the basal-plane La-O and Cu-O bond lengths in the tetragonal structure that makes the tolerance factor

\[t \equiv [{\rm La} - {\rm O}]/[{\sqrt 2}[{\rm Cu} - {\rm O}]] < 1\]

decrease with decreasing temperature because of the larger thermal expansion of the La-O bond. A t < 1 places the Cu-O bonds in the CuO2 sheets under a compressive force that is relieved by the distortion to the orthorhombic phase.12 From Eq. (1), a _dT__t_/_dP_ < 0 therefore signals a _dt_/_dP_ > 0, which means that the Cu-O bonds in the basal plane are more compressible than the La-O bond as predicted for a double-well potential for the Cu-O bonds of the CuO2 sheets, provided a large fraction of the longer, ionic Cu-O bonds are present in the sheets.

A double-well potential for the Cu-O bond not only has important implications for the character of the normal state of the superconductive phase;13 it also provides a first-order driving force for a segregation in the range 0 < d < 0.05 between a parent antiferromagnetic phase with all ionic bonding and a second phase with either all covalent bonding or a vibronic resonance between ionic and covalent bonding. Were the second phase a conventional metal, we could anticipate that in it all the Cu-O bonding would be covalent. However, stabilization of a high-_T__t_ superconductive phase rather than a conventional metal has led us to postulate the existence of a vibronic resonance between the two types of Cu-O bonding with the formation of a correlation-polaron gas above room temperature that condenses below room temperature into a polaron liquid.13 In this paper, we are interested only in the fact that, in a mixed-valent system, a double-well potential can provide a _vibronic_ driving force for the observed phase segregation below room temperature in La2CuO4+_d_. We14,15 have assumed such a driving force exists in our interpretation of the phase diagram for the system La2-_x_Sr_CuO4.

### Ordering of the interstitial oxygen

On the other hand, a conventional structural phase change could also provide the driving force for the phase segregation. The excess oxygen in La2CuO4+_d_ has been located by neutron diffraction;8 it resides in the interstitial position between LaO planes that is coordinated by four La and four apical oxygen atoms. As first demonstrated16 for La2NiO4+_d_, this position is partially occupied in oxygen-excess compounds having the K2NiF4 structure. Evidence for a structural phase change occurring in the interval 0.05 < d < 0.07 comes from samples containing d > 0.05. Such samples have been prepared electrochemically by a method pioneered by Wattiaux _et al._17 A preliminary phase diagram below room temperature has been developed by Grenier _et al._18 This latter study showed a linear decrease with increasing d in the room-temperature orthorhombicity of the structure for d <= 0.05, which is consistent with a random distribution of the excess oxygen in the interstitial sites. The insertion of interstitial oxide ions not only expands the LaO-dO-LaO layers; it also relieves the compressive stress on the CuO2 sheets by oxidizing them, so the tolerance factor t increases and T_{t} decreases with increasing d. On the other hand, the structures for d >= 0.07 show a linear increase with d in the orthorhombicity of the room-temperature structure, which signals that the interstitial oxygen atoms are ordered where d >= 0.07 is found. An increase in the orthorhombicity with d is consistent with the addition of interstitial oxygen in the special positions of the ordered phase. This deduction has been confirmed by neutron-diffraction data, which show superstructure lines indicative of oxygen ordering in samples with d = 0.08 and 0.12.19 Moreover, no evidence of phase segregation has been found above 10 K in samples d > 0.07,19 which shows that the phase with ordered oxygen is stable. Therefore this phase could provide a driving force for the phase segregation observed in the range 0 < d < 0.05.

### The p = \frac{1}{k} phase

In order to determine whether the driving force for the phase segregation below T_{t} observed for 0 < d < 0.05 is vibronic in origin or is due to an ordering of the interstitial oxygen atoms, it is necessary to determine the limiting value d_t_ for the spinodal phase segregation as well as the critical value d_th_ above which the interstitial oxygen atoms are ordered. To date, the range of compositions 0.050 <= d < 0.070 in which d_th_ falls has not been explored. Moreover, this compositional range contains the composition d = 0.0625, which corresponds to p = \frac{1}{k} holes per Cu atom if the interstitial oxygen is present as O2- ions. In the La2-_x_BaCuO4 system, the superconductive phase is completely suppressed at x = \frac{1}{k},20 and below 950degC superconductive samples with 0.13 <= x <= 0.25 in this system are reported21 to phase segregate via La and Ba diffusion into two nonsuperconductive phases: an x = \frac{1}{k} and an overdoped metallic phase. At these temperatures, no structural transition is associated with the phase segregation. A similar stabilization of a nonsuperconductive phase may occur at d = 0.0625 in the system La2CuO4+_d_. Such a phase could provide an _electronic_ driving force for the phase segregation found in the range 0 < d < 0.05.

  Therefore it is also necessary to know both d_{s} and d_{o} relative to d = 0.0625.

### Evidence from neutron diffraction of a d_s_ = 0.05 < d_s_

Chaillout _et al._8 have performed a structural refinement on a single crystal with d = 0.032 to determine the extent of phase segregation at various temperatures down to 15 K. At 15 K, the compound was segregated into the parent phase (d  0) and a superconductive phase with a calculated d_s_  0.048. Moreover, the structure of the d = 0.048 phase was found to be the same as the average orthorhombic structure in the range 0 < d <= 0.05 at room temperature; there was no evidence of ordering of the interstitial oxygen. These data indicate a d_s_(max)  0.050 < d_s__o_, which supports the conclusion that the spinodal phase segregation occurring in the temperature interval 200 < T < 320 K for 0 < d < 0.05 is not due to an ordering of the interstitial oxygen atoms. Moreover, these data indicate a d_s_(max) < 0.0625, which suggests that a _vibronic_ driving force is responsible for the phase segregation rather than either an ordering of the interstitial oxygen atoms O_i_ or an electronic stabilization of a p = \frac{1}{\tau} phase.

### Motivation and strategy of this paper

Our principal motivation for this study was to investigate further the driving force for the static phase segregation occurring in the compositional range 0 < d < 0.05 in the system La2CuO4+_b_. We also wished to explore for evidence of a p = \frac{1}{\tau} phase in the hitherto unexplored compositional range 0.05 < d < 0.07. We monitor the temperature range of any phase segregation that is occurring from the temperature dependences of the resistance and thermoelectric power. From the pressure dependence of T_{c}, we are able to distinguish whether the orthorhombic distortion is due to a cooperative tilting of the CuO6 octahedra or an ordering of the interstitial oxygen atoms. By comparing the transport properties of slow-cooled samples with and without high pressure with those of samples quenched from room temperature to liquid nitrogen, we reinforce the use of transport data to monitor the diffusion-controlled phase segregation.

A related study has been reported by Ahrens _et al._22 for a single composition d = 0.032; these authors used magnetic susceptibility and La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) to probe the phase segregation. They argued, as have we,13 that T_{c} increases with the size of the segregated superconductive domains where the domain size is comparable to the magnetic penetration depth. They found a systematic increase of about 4 K in the bulk critical temperature T_{c} (the transition midpoint) with decreasing anneal temperature T_{a} in the range 200 < T < 300 K. A maximum T_{c} = 29.6 K with a magnetic-susceptibility onset temperature T_{n} = 34 K was reported for T_{a} = 200 K.

To explain our use of the temperature dependences of the Seebeck coefficient a and the resistance R to monitor the temperature range over which phase segregation is occurring, we cite the data of Hundley _et al._23; they have demonstrated that in single-crystal La2CuO4+_b_, d = 0.032, the in-plane resistivity r increases with decreasing temperature over the temperature range of spinodal phase segregation, and the in-plane thermoelectric power a decreases with decreasing temperature. We have noted similar changes in the resistance R and in a in polycrystalline samples of La2CuO4+_b_;18 they provide a definition of the temperature interval over which the static spinodal phase segregation is occurring for different values of d, and we use this criterion in this paper.

Another example where this signature in the transport properties occurs is found in La1,875Ba0.125CuO4, where a low-temperature tetragonal (LTT) phase coexists with the orthorhombic phase in the temperature interval 35 < T < 60 K;20 in this case, static cooperative atomic displacements make visible to diffraction the two distinguishable phases, which probably contain different charge-carrier concentrations. In this case, also, the two-phase region is characterized by a _dR_/_dT_ < 0 and a _da_/_dT_ > 0.

Our final motivation for this study is the need to clarify the situation in the overdoped region d > 0.07. Samples with d >= 0.07 prepared electrochemically have exhibited a step in T_{c} suggestive of the presence of two superconductive phases, one with a T_{c}  36 K and another with a T_{c}  41 K. It is possible that the T_{c}  36 K corresponds to the maximum T_{c} to be associated with the phase containing disordered interstitial oxygen and a T_{c}  41 K corresponds to a phase with completely ordered interstitial oxygen. Samples in the range 0.07 <= d <= 0.12 may be phase segregating at room temperature into domains of ordered interstitial oxygen within a matrix of disordered interstitial oxygen. Such an interpretation has been implied by Johnston _et al._24 in their magnetic investigation of electrochemically prepared La2CuO4+_b_. Alternatively, the step could be a manifestation of vortex motion in the superconductive state just below T_{c}.

## EXPERIMENTAL

Polycrystalline samples were prepared by reacting in air a stoichiometric mixture of the oxides at 1030-1100 degC for 1 week with intermittent grinding. The La2O3 powder was calcined at 980 degC immediately before weighing. Before the final sintering, the powder samples were ground in a milling machine to obtain a finer powder than is obtainable with regular grinding. Sintering just above the reaction temperature of 1050 degC gave a hard, dense pellet. The samples were then oxidized electrochemically at room temperature following the procedure of Wattiaux _et al._17 and Grenier _et al._18 The amount of excess oxygen inserted electrochemically was controlled by the polarization time; however, oxygen evolution is a competitive side reaction, and the final oxidation state was determined by iodometric titration to within an error of better than +-0.01 for d. In our experiments we obtained an accuracy better than +-0.005. The relatively high oxygen mobility at room temperature ensures that homogeneity of the oxygen distribution is obtained at room temperature within a few days. However, for samples 0.047 and 0.066 we inserted the oxygen elec  trochemically at 360 K in order to obtain easier control over the oxygen content. We obtained a d = 0.054 sample at room temperature, but we found it difficult to vary d by small steps at room temperature in the range 0.034 < d < 0.070. At room temperature, the samples were electrochemically oxidized quickly in this region to d = 0.070, which appears to be close to the order-disorder boundary d _d_o. The evolution of properties with d was not influenced by the temperature at which the samples were prepared. All samples were single phase to x-ray diffraction after both sintering and electrochemical oxidation.

Magnetic susceptibility was measured with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. Measurements of the Seebeck coefficient were carried out with a home-made apparatus in which the temperature gradient D_T_ across the sample was carefully controlled. Resistance measurements were made with a four-probe, dc technique; the background potential in the voltage pickup leads was subtracted out. Electrical resistance measurements under nearly hydrostatic pressure were performed with a Be-Cu self-clamping device25 containing a Teflon cell, a lead manometer, and a 1:1 mixture of _n_-pentane and isoamyl alcohol as a pressure-transmitting medium. Indium was first pressed onto the sample surface for electrical contact. Thin copper wire was then pressed into the indium contact with small pieces of indium foil. The sample temperature was measured with a silicon diode attached to a place near the Teflon cell. During a measuring run, the cooling rate was computer controlled to be less than 0.1 K/min.

## RESULTS

Figure 1 shows the Meissner effect for typical samples from three regions of the La2CuO4+d system. The curve for the d = 0.034 sample is similar to that previously reported24 for d = 0.032; that for d = 0.070 has a larger Meissner fraction and a higher T_{c}. Johnston _et al._24 reported the same higher Meissner fraction, but a lower T_{c} = 30 K, whereas Grenier _et al._18 reported two values of T_{c}, one near 40 K and the other near 30 K. We observe a single transition at 40 K. We also find (see below) a jump of 10 K in T_{c} on crossing the composition d_o, where 0.066 < d < 0.070. The literature does not report data for a d = 0.054 sample.

The resistance versus temperature data for different hydrostatic pressures that are displayed in Figs. 2(a)-2(g) were highly reproducible. The high-pressure data were taken on samples that had been cooled slowly down to liquid-He temperatures. In order to clarify how a diffusion-controlled phase segregation occurring between 200 K and room temperature influences the low-temperature (_T_ < 50 K) resistance data, measurements at atmospheric pressure were also carried out on all samples after quenching from room temperature to 77 K. Comparison of the resistance versus temperature curves for the same sample after a slow cool (0.2 K/min) and quenching is presented in the insets of Figs. 2(a)-2(g). Quenching was done by plunging the high-pressure chamber in liquid N2, which lowers the temperature to below 200 K in about 1 min. The total cooling from room temperature to 77 K took about 5 min.

Table I provides information on several critical temperatures extracted from the data of Fig. 2. For samples with 0 < d < 0.070, we distinguish two onset temperatures for a drop in the resistance with decreasing temperature in the range T < 50 K, a T_{d} and a T_{n} where T_{d} > T_{n}. The temperatures T_{d} and T_{n} in Table I correspond to the temperatures at which the slope of the _R_-vs-_T_ curves of Fig. 2 abruptly increases on cooling. Hydrostatic pressure suppresses the resistivity drop at _T__d_; but for pressures P < 10 kbar, a _dT__d_/_dP_ < 0 can be observed. On the other hand band, the onset temperature T_{n} for the superconductive transition increases with pressure and is not suppressed.

The critical temperature T_{c} in Table I is taken as the midpoint of the superconductive transition occurring below _T__on. A _dT__c_/_dP_ > 0 was observed for all samples 0.17 <= d <= 0.054, but its magnitude decreased with increasing d. A _dT__c_/_dP_ < 0 was found for d = 0.066. The temperature for onset of zero resistance also had a pressure dependence _dT__o_/_dP_ > 0 for d = 0.017 and 0.034; it vanished for d = 0.054. In contrast, samples with d >= 0.070 had no T_{d} anomaly and a _dT__c_/_dP_ = _dT__on_/_dP_ > 0.06 K/kbar, a value lower than the 0.11 K/kbar found10 for the orthorhombic superconductor La1.85F0.15CuO4.

The increase in resistance with decreasing temperature in the range 200 < T < 300 K observed at atmospheric pressure for slowly cooled samples correlates with the temperature domain where diffusion of the interstitial oxygen atoms has been shown to create a classic spinodal phase segregation. This feature is found in the _R_-vs-_T_ curves of all samples 0.017 <= d <= 0.054 slow cooled at atmospheric pressure, but it is not prominent in the d = 0.047 and 0.054 samples. Although this feature is not observed in sample 0.066 and is only weakly so in 0.047 and 0.054, the change in low-temperature resistance of these samples on quenching from room temperature to 77 K demonstrates that some oxygen movement occurs below room temperature in these samples also. We con

  clude from the quenching experiments that the interstitial oxygen atoms are mobile and induce phase segregation below room temperature in all samples investigated throughout the compositional range 0<8\leq 0.066, but for \delta\geq 0.070 the interstitial oxygen atoms do not move during cooling, as is confirmed by the absence of any difference in transport properties of the quenched and slow-cooled samples [see Figs 2(f) and 2(g)]. This observation tells us that the system is thermodynamically stable for \delta\geq 0.070 since the O_{i} atoms are still mobile at room temperature.

Figure 3 compares the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient \alpha and the resistance R for the \delta=0.017 and 0.070 samples; the former is representative of samples 8=0.017 and 0.032, the latter of samples \delta\geq 0.070. A decrease in \alpha and an increase in R with decreasing T are found for the \delta=0.017 sample in the range 200<T<300 K where phase segregation is known to be occurring by oxygen diffusion. As mentioned above, this feature in \alpha and R is characteristic of a temperature interval of phase segregation, not only in this system, but also in La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4}; it is not found in the \delta=0.070 sample where there is no evidence of oxygen mobility. However, the \delta=0.070 sample exhibits a step in the resistance drop at T_{c}; this step is found in all samples \delta\geq 0.070 and is the same as that reported by Grenier _et al._[18]. The transition above this step is seen to increase with pressure; however, the R-vs-T curve is less sensitive to pressure for temperatures below this step, the temperature of essentially zero resistance changing little with pressure [see Figs. 2(f) and 2(g)].

Figure 4 compares the resistance drop with decreasing temperature at T_{d}\approx 47 K in the \delta=0.054 sample with the drop at T_{\rm on}=43 K in the \delta=0.070 sample. The thermopower voltage V(T) is measured relative to a temperature of 50 K fixed on one side of the sample; the temperature T on the other side was controlled to scan the temperature region of interest. In Fig. 4, the Seebeck coefficient \alpha was taken as the slope of the plot of thermopotential V versus T. The width of the resistivity and susceptibility transitions is somewhat broader than is found in the La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system, but it is similar to that found by others in the La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} system for the same values of \delta[18, 24].

In the sample \delta=0.054, changes in d\alpha/dT occur at both T_{d} and T_{\rm on}, \alpha falling to zero below T_{0}. A Meissner diamagnetism only sets in at temperatures T<T_{\rm on}=35 K, which is well separated from T_{d}\approx 47 K. No super

  conductive transition is to be associated with T_{d}. The same is true for all samples 0.017 \leq 8 \leq 0.066. In a magnetic field H = 0.1 T, the magnetic susceptibility shows a small decrease setting in below T_{d}, but there is no Meissner diamagnetism.

In the sample \delta = 0.070, on the other hand, the Seebeck coefficient drops to zero and a Meissner signal sets in below the first drop in resistance with decreasing temperature; it therefore marks an onset temperature T_{\rm on} = 43 K for superconductivity. However, an anomalous "tail" in the R-vs-T curve persists into the superconductive temperature range where \alpha = 0. This "tail" gives rise to the step in R vs T at T_{c} discussed above in connection with Fig. 3. The presence of this step has suggested the existence of a second superconductive phase corresponding to \delta = 0.11,[18, 24] but an alternate interpretation is the prediction of Levi[26] that the high-T_{c} superconductors contain vortices in a liquid state to give a nonzero resistance even in the absence of an applied magnetic field. In our sample, the Meissner effect shows a single phase (Fig. 1), and we believe the latter interpretation applies in our case.

The feature characteristic of phase segregation appearing above 200 K in the R-vs-T curve for slow-cooled samples 0 \leq 8 \leq 0.054 (with the exception of \delta = 0.047 and 0.066) is increasingly suppressed by hydrostatic pressures (see Fig. 2). We conclude that hydrostatic pressure inhibits diffusion of the interstitial oxygen below room temperature.

An analogous increase in resistance with decreasing temperature occurs in all samples 0.017 \leq 8 \leq 0.066 below 100 K; a decrease in \alpha with decreasing temperature is also found in the same temperature interval. Unlike the similar feature in the range 200 < T < 300 K, this feature occurring below 100 K in La_{2}CuO_{4 + \delta} is not suppressed either by quenching to 77 K from room temperature or by hydrostatic pressure; it is not associated with a diffusion-controlled phase segregation. A similar phenomenon is found in the La_{2 - x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system for x \leq 0.10; we have interpreted it to signal the presence of charge fluctuations induced by cooperative, dynamic atomic displacements associated with a dynamic resonance between covalent and ionic equilibrium Cu-O bond lengths.[13] This feature is essentially absent in samples with \delta \geq 0.070. The resistance deviates from a linear dependence only just above T_{c} in the samples \delta \geq 0.070, the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient \alpha is totally different from that for \delta = 0.019.

Finally, the sample with \delta = 0.047, Fig. 2(c), exhibited a negative resistance just above T_{0}. The effect was highly reproducible for several different specimens cut from the same sample; it was found both after quenching under 1 bar and on the application of hydrostatic pressure, but was essentially absent in the sample slow cooled at atmospheric pressure. A very careful measurement of \alpha vs T showed that \alpha \neq 0 in the temperature range where the negative resistance occurs. Although pressure might cause the pressure-transmitting medium to become solid at low temperatures and to induce a shear stress on the sample, this explanation would not apply to the quenched sample; we rule it out. The four-probe configuration was not exactly the same as in the van der Pauw method. However, the origin of the negative resistance was not due to our experimental technique, but to something intrinsic to this sample. With the same experimental system, we have carried out extensive measurements on La_{2 - x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} without encountering such an anomaly.[10] Normally, a fixed current establishes a distribution of equipotential lines in the sample that is invariant with temperature in a single-phase sample; only the voltage gradient changes. In this sample, the equipotential pattern must change with temperature just above T_{0} so as to give rise to a crossing of the voltages at the two leads. A possible cause for such a crossing is the appearance of a phase inhomogeneity just above T_{0} such as might be introduced by charge fluctuations.

## Discussions

### T_{s} vs \delta

The available data are summarized in the phase diagram of Fig. 5. We begin our discussion of it with the

  temperature T_{s} below which a diffusion-controlled phase segregation sets in.

The T_{s} for \delta\!\approx\!0.03 has been reported to fall in the range 290\!\leq\!T_{s}\!\leq\!320 K.[6, 7, 8] No detectable interstitial oxygen was found in the antiferromagnetic parent phase at low \delta; the concentration of this parent phase increases with lowering temperature, but there is no evidence of a change in composition, which indicates a \delta\!\approx\!0 for all temperatures T\!<\!T_{s} in this phase. On the other hand, the evolution of lattice parameters with temperature[6]^{-}[8] clearly indicates that the high-\delta phase below T_{s} for \delta\!=\!0.03 contains increasing concentrations of oxygen as the temperature is lowered to 200 K. Neutron-diffraction data from a \delta\!=\!0.032 sample[6] show, for example, an abrupt change in the thermal-expansion coefficient at 200 K in the oxygen-rich phase, but no change in thermal expansion of the parent phase. The T_{s}-vs-\delta points shown in Fig. 5 were calculated by us from the temperature variation of the fraction of parent phase reported in the literature.[8] A dT_{s}/d\delta\!<\!0 is clearly indicated.

A recent publication[27] gives a somewhat different phase diagram than that shown in Fig. 5. It is based on neutron-diffraction data for a \delta\!=\!0.032 sample that contradicts the earlier work.[6] The "lever rule" was used for three different compositions to locate a parent-phase boundary near \delta\!=\!0.01 and a superconductive-phase boundary near \delta\!=\!0.055. Within the titration error \pm 0.005 for \delta, the high-\delta boundary is similar to ours. We apply the "lever rule" with the assumption that the limit of the parent phase is \delta\!=\!0 on the earlier neutron-diffraction results.[6] We believe that Fig. 5 represents a more realistic phase diagram, but undoubtedly the parent phase has a finite, though small, limiting value of \delta.

### The superconductive phase at \delta\!=\!\delta,

With 290\!\leq\!T_{s}\!\leq\!320 K, some phase segregation occurs already at room temperature in samples with \delta\!=\!0.03. Consequently Ahrens _et al.[22]_ found that a \delta\!=\!0.032 sample quenched from room temperature to 5 K was superconductive with a T_{c}\!=\!25.6 K. Sufficient phase segregation had taken place at room temperature that the \delta-rich phase at ambient conditions becomes superconductive. Since the \delta-rich phase shows no evidence of an ordering of the interstitial oxygen, we conclude that the driving force for phase segregation is not structural; it is either vibronic or electronic. Since the \delta-rich phase is superconductive, the driving force is not an electronic stabilization of a p\!=\!\frac{1}{\delta} phase, which is not superconductive. The data are therefore consistent with a vibronic stabilization of a superconductive phase that, below 300 K, is thermodynamically distinguishable from the antiferromagnetic parent phase.[15, 18]

Ahrens _et al.[22]_ then annealed at temperatures T_{a}\!\leq\!250 K the \delta\!=\!0.032 sample that had been quenched into liquid He from room temperature. After each anneal, the sample was again quenched into liquid He. The superconductive critical temperature T_{c} increased as T was raised, reaching a maximum of 29.6 K for T_{a}\!=\!200 K. The increase in T_{c} requires mobility of the O_{i}; the equilibrium distribution only occurs for T\!\geq\!200 K. Over the range 200\!\leq\!T_{a}\!\leq\!250 K, T_{c} decreased monotonically, extrapolating to 25.6 K for a room-temperature anneal. Since \delta_{s} increases with decreasing T, these data indicate that the high-\delta phase is underdoped with respect to the optimum oxidation of the CuO_{2} sheets, which would account for an increase in T_{c} with \delta_{s} in the \delta-rich phase.

### The Neel temperature

**Whereas stoichiometric La_{2}CuO_{4} has a T_{N}\!\approx\!320 K,[28] the Neel temperature of the antiferromagnetic phase at the limiting composition of the parent compound remains at T_{N}\!\approx\!250 K to \delta\!\approx\!0.03.[24] The reduction in T_{N} from 320 to 250 K probably signals the presence of a \delta\!>\!0 too small to be detected by neutron diffraction in the low-\delta phase; it may also reflect internal strains associated with the coexistence of two phases created by diffusion below room temperature. We indicate in Fig. 5 a \delta\!\approx\!0 for the parent phase, but 250\!<\!T_{N}\!<\!320 K within this phase. For \delta\!\geq\!0.047, we found no evidence for long-range magnetic order; any parent phase \delta\!\approx\!0 has been reduced by \delta\!=\!0.047 to too small a concentration to be detected at a \delta\!\approx\!\delta_{s}(max).**

### Location of d d _d_ s _d_

For d < d d, the orthorhombic distortion at lower temperatures is due to a cooperative rotation of the CuO6 octahedra that relieves the internal stresses associated with bond-length mismatch. The orthorhombic-tetragonal transition temperature T_{t} decreases with increasing d in the range d <= d <= d 0.05 because the tolerance factor t of Eq. (1) increases with d where the interstitial oxygen atoms Oi are randomly distributed between pairs of LaO planes.12,18 The Oi2-ions relieve the tensile stress in the LaO-dOiLaO layers, and oxidation of the CuO2 sheets reduces the mean equilibrium Cu-O bond length.

An observed increase with d in the room-temperature orthorhombicity for d >= 0.070 is reflected in Fig. 5 by an undetermined (because of oxygen loss at T > 300 K) orthorhombic-tetragonal transition temperature _T__t_' increasing with d. In this compositional range, the orthorhombic distortion is due to an ordering of the interstitial oxygen atoms; the CuO2 planes remain flat in this orthorhombic phase.19 A d d falling in the range 0.066 < d d < 0.070 is indicated by the disappearance of any evidence of phase segregation in samples d >= 0.070. This deduction is also consistent with the _dT__c_ /_dP_ data of Table I, which are discussed below.

### Oxidation state of the interstitial oxygen

The _R_-vs-_T_ and _a_-vs-_T_ curves of Fig. 3 for d = 0.070 are similar to those found for x = 0.14 in La2-xSrCuO4; they are characteristic of an optimally doped copper oxide superconductor.15 The similarity in magnitude of a and shape of a vs T for those samples indicates a hole concentration per Cu atom in each of p = 0.14, which would seem to confirm the hypothesis that below room temperature the interstitial oxygen is present as Oi2-ions for d = 0.070.

A small, if any, change in T_{c} and the magnitude of a between d = 0.070 and d = 0.090 was previously interpreted18 to mean that, for d > 0.070, the LaO-dOi-LaO layers act as charge reservoirs because they have O-2p states that overlap the Fermi energy E_{F}. However, Table I indicates a definite decrease in T_{c} from 40.4 K for d = 0.070 to 37.8 K for d = 0.095. These values of T_{c} are compatible with the flat maximum in T_{c} vs x found in the range 0.14 <= x <= d 0.19 for La2-xSrCuO4 where, without question, p = x for a stoichiometric oxygen concentration O4 per formula unit.10 Therefore the data of Table I give no compelling reason to believe the interstitial oxygen enter as anything other than Oi2- ions over the entire compositional range d >= 0.070, particularly as _dT__c_/_dP_ s = 0.065 K/kbar for d >= 0.070 is relatively small. Pressure generally alters the distribution of holes between a reservoir and the CuO2 sheets so as to alter _dT__c_/_dP_ significantly. On the other hand, _dT__c_/_dP_ = 0 is found for flat CuO2 planes in La2-xSrCuO4 10 and the large a does not decrease on increasing d from 0.070 to 0.095 as would be expected for a large statistical contribution to the Seebeck coefficient; a d _a_/_dx_ < 0 occurs in La2-xSrCuO4 on going from x = 0.14 to 0.18. The availability of a charge reservoir remains a distinct possibility for d > 0.070.

In the compositional range d < 0.070, the introduction of Oi atoms clearly oxidizes the CuO2 sheets; it appears they enter as Oi2- ions at lower concentrations. However, evidence for some charge transfer between the interstitial oxygen and the CuO2 sheets can be found in the electronic behavior at T_{d}, a transition that we associate with the "_p_ = 1/2 " phase. The Seebeck coefficient drops on lowering the temperature through T_{d}, which is consistent with a higher hole concentration in the CuO2 sheets at temperatures T < T_{d}.

The layered structure of La2CuO4 supports strong internal electric fields associated with formal charges 2 + and 2 - for the alternating (LaO)2 and CuO2 layers. These fields favor stabilization of Oi2- ions within the rocksalt LaO-Oi-LaO layers; incorporation of Oi2- ions lowers the formal charges of the layers to (2 - 28) + and (2 - 28) -, which lowers the probability of electron capture by the Oi atoms as d increases. Ordering of the interstitial oxygen at d = 0.070 apparently stabilizes electron capture at Oi2- ions; in the disordered phase the transfer of electrons from the CuO2 sheets to the Oi2- ions appears to be less stable as d increases. We attribute the peculiar experimental difficulty in obtaining electrochemically compositions in the range 0.035 < d < 0.070 to this phenomenon.

### Origin of the step at T_{c} for d >= 0.07

Although we are unable to determine from our experiments whether the LaO-dOi-LaO layers are acting as a charge reservoir in the range d >= 0.070, nevertheless the step in the _R_-vs-_T_ curve at T_{c} found in the range d >= 0.070 can be attributed to liquid-state vortices rather than the presence of a second phase since the step gives an anomalous "tail" in the _R_-vs-_T_ curve that extends into the superconductive temperature range where a = 0.

### The transition at T_{l}

Above a temperature T_{l}, where 300 <= T_{l} < 500 K, the system La2-xSrCuO4 shows a complete solid solution over the entire compositional range 0 <= x <= 0.34. The _R_-vs-_T_ curve for T > T_{l} changes gradually with increasing x from weakly concave to the temperature axis in the underdoped samples to a _T__l_' dependence in the overdoped samples; y increases with x from y = 1.0 to y = 1.4 in the overdoped samples.29 Below T_{l}, the _a_-vs-_T_ and _R_-vs-_T_ curve show a marked transition on passing from the underdoped compositions 0 < x <= 0.10 to the optimally doped compositions 0.14 <= x <= 0.20. Whereas a is essentially temperature independent down to a T_{p} <= 150 K in the underdoped samples, the characteristic feature of the _a_-vs-_T_ curves for the optimally doped samples is a transition to a temperature dependence below T_{l} that exhibits a pronounced maximum, having a shape suggestive of the addition of a giant mass enhancement of the transport term. In these samples; R increases linearly with T below T_{l}. We have interpreted this behavior to be indicative of a _correlation-polaron gas_ above T_{l} for all compositions 0 < x < 0.34 that condenses below T_{l} into a _polaron liquid_ having a stable compositional range 0.14 <= x <= 0.20.13 Since p = x in the La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 system for a stoichiometric oxygen content, we can expect the La2CuO4+ system to exhibit the same _a_-_vs_-_T_ and _R_-_vs_-_T_ behavior in the range 0.07 <= d <= 0.11 if the interstitial oxygen is present as O_i_2- ions. The curves for d=0.070 shown in Fig. 2 are similar to those for x = 0.14 in La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4; however, they are restricted to T < 300 K because of problems with loss of oxygen at higher temperatures. A possible change of slope in the _a_-_vs_-_T_ curve at a T_{l}  300 K is just discernible.

### Indirect evidence for charge fluctuations in La2CuO4+_d

According to the correlation-polaron model, underdoped samples in the range 0 < p < 0.10 become metastable below 300 K with respect to a phase segregation into the parent and supeconductive phases. In La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4, conventional segregation into hole-rich and hole-poor domains is prevented by lack of a mobile ion; segregation only occurs below a T_{p}  150 K via cooperative atomic displacements that, because of vibronic coupling, remain dynamic and therefore result in charge fluctuations.

A d_d_d_(max)  0.05 at T <= 200 K in Fig. 5 for La2CuO4+_d_ corresponds to a hole concentration per Cu in the CuO2 sheets of p = 0.10 if all the O_i_ atoms are present as O_i_2- ions. A p  0.10 still lies within the range of underdoped samples if optimum doping is restricted to 0.14 <= p <= 0.20. It is therefore legitimate to ask why d_d_s does not mark the boundary of optimum doping if the driving force for phase segregation is indeed stabilization of the superconductive phase. We answer that question qualitatively by noting that Coulombic repulsions between O_i_2- ions as well as the local lattice deformation around each O_i_2- ion resist stabilization of a higher-d phase with disordered O_i_2- ions. This resistance accounts for a _dT__s_/_d_d_d_d_ < 0 in Fig. 5. Were the O_i_ atoms mobile at T < 200 K, a d_d_s_(max) > 0.05 could be expected.

The signature for the onset of charge fluctuations below a T_{p}  150 K in underdoped La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 is a _dR_/_dT_ < 0 and a _d_a_/_dT_ > 0 in the range T_{c} < T < T, a behavior like that occurring in the interval 200 < T < 300 K in La2CuO4+_d_ for 0 < _d_d_s_ < 0.05. The appearance of the characteristic signature _d_a_/_dT_ > 0 and _dR_/_dT_ < 0 below 100 K for all samples 0.017 <= 0.066, but not for d >= 0.070, despite a static phase segregation to d = 0 and d_d_s_ <= 0.05 in samples 0 < d < 0.05, would therefore indicate that charge fluctuations persist in the interval T_{c} < T < T, for 0.050 <= _d_s_ < 0.070. This conclusion appears surprising; however, the situation is made more complex by the insertion of a d=0.0625 phase, corresponding to p = \frac{1}{k} lying within the range 0.10 < p < 0.14. The insertion of this phase introduces the possibility of an electronically driven phase separation at low temperatures and also allows the evidence for a diffusion-controlled segregation via mobile O_i_2- ions in the d=0.054 and 0.066 samples to be reconciled with the _T__s_-_s_-d curve of Fig. 5 obtained from neutron-diffraction data.

### The p = \frac{1}{k} phase

With a d_d_s_(max)  0.05 and a 0.066 < d_d_0 < 0.070, we need to ask what is happening in the range d_d_s_ < d_d_d_d_. To answer this question, we monitor (a) the variation with d of T0, the temperature below which the resistance vanishes, (b) the evidence for a diffusion-controlled process occurring near room temperature in this compositional range, and (c) the temperature variation of R and a below 150 K that we have interpreted elsewhere to signal the onset of charge fluctuations.

From Table I, we see that the slow-cooled samples all have a T = 26 K for 0 < 6 < 0.05, which would indicate a common value of d for the superconductive phase segregated out at d_d_s_(max)  0.05. On the other hand, T0 goes through a minimum in the interval 0.054 < d < 0.066. This behavior is analogous to the suppression of T_{c} at p = \frac{1}{k}, corresponding to d=0.0625, that has been well established for the system La2-_x_Ba_CuO4 at x = p = \frac{1}{k}. (A similar suppression of T_{c} may also occur near x = \frac{1}{k} in a well-homogenized La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 system.30) We are led to conclude that a similar nonsuperconductive phase is being stabilized near d=0.0625 in the La2CuO4+_d_ system and that stabilization of this phase is _electronically_ driven. The transition at d_d_s_ is _structurally_ driven, and the phase segregation between the parent compound and the superconductive phase at d_d_s_(max) has been postulated by us to be _vibronically_ driven.

The p = \frac{1}{k} phase may be stable above 300 K, as is demonstrated in La1.84Ba0.16CuO4 by the phase segregation below 950 degC into two nonsuperconductive phases: one at p = \frac{1}{k} and the other an overdoped metallic phase with p > 0.25.31 Evidence for a diffusion-controlled phase segregation in the d=0.054 and 0.066 samples would then be interpretable in the former as a phase segregation below T_{l} between a p = \frac{1}{k} phase and a polaron-liquid superconductive phase at lower (d  0.05) and, in the latter, between a p = \frac{1}{k} phase and an O_i_-ordered superconductive phase at higher (d  0.070) values of d.

Segregation of the d=0.054 sample into a superconductive p  0.10 and a p = \frac{1}{k} phase cannot be driven by the order-disorder transition of the interstitial oxygen since we found 0.066 < d_s_ < 0.070. Moreover, only relatively small changes in the oxygen distribution are evident between the slow-cooled and the quenched samples or after cooling under pressure; the principal phase segregation appears to occur below T_{p}, which is consistent with an electronic stabilization of a nonsuperconductive p = \frac{1}{k} phase that competes with a vibronically stabilized superconductive phase.

### Effect of pressure

Hydrostatic pressure suppresses the resistive anomaly at _T__d_s 47 K that is found in all samples 0.017 <= d <= 0.066, but not for d >= 0.070. This transition  is not superconductive. The drop in a with decreasing T at T_{c} begins at a T_{f} >= _T_on below which Cooper-pair fluctuations occur; the drop in a with decreasing T at T_{d} occurs at the temperature T_{d} of the resistive drop. No superconductive pair fluctuations are associated with T_{d}.

Pressure reduces the anomaly in the _R_-vs-_T_ curves of Figs. 2(a)-2(d) in the range 200 < T < 300 K, which indicates that pressure suppresses the _O__i_-atom diffusion. The suppression of T_{d}, but not T_{s}, with hydrostatic pressure shows that the anomaly at T_{s} is independent of O__i_-atom diffusion whereas T_{d} may be associated with the diffusion-controlled phase segregation. In the d = 0.066 sample, suppression of the O__i_-atom diffusion by pressure results in a broadening of the superconductive transition over the interval 16-40 K. Since T_{d} is suppressed by quenching [see Fig. 2(a), for example], as well as by pressure, we are led to conclude that T_{d} is associated with the static component of the phase segregation to p = 1/2.

We discuss the pressure effect on T_{c}, _dT__c_/_dP_ of Table I, within the context of the effect found for the system La2-Sr2CuO4 where a _dT__c_/_dP_  0.11 K/kbar occurring in the orthorhombic phase at x  0.15 becomes _dT__c_/_dP_  0 in the tetragonal phase.10 In the tetragonal phase, the Cu-O-Cu bond angle in the CuO2 sheets is 180deg; in the orthorhombic phase, a cooperative tilting of the CuO6 octahedra reduces this angle, so we associate a _dT__c_/_dP_ > 0 in La2-Sr2CuO4 with the deformation of the CuO2 sheets by octahedral-site tilting. In La2CuO4+_b_, there are two distinguishable orthorhombic phases denoted O1 and _O_II in Fig. 5. In the O1 phase, the O_{i} atoms are disordered and at 15 K the CuO6 octahedra are tilted as in the orthorhombic phase of the system La2-_x_Sr2CuO4; in the _O_II phase the O_{i} atoms are ordered and at 4 K the CuO6 octahedra are not tilted.19 Therefore, in the absence of charge transfer between the CuO2 sheets and a charge reservoir in the nonsuperconductive layers, the value of _dT__c_/_dP_ can distinguish between an O1 and an _O_II orthorhombic phase.

The application of pressure at room temperature inhibits, but does not suppress totally, further phase segregation below room temperature (see Fig. 1) in the range 0 < d < 0.05. The decrease in _dT__c_/_dP_ from 0.29 K/kbar for d = 0.34 to 0.13 K/kbar for d = 0.054 is consistent with an increase with d in the Cu-O-Cu bond angle within the CuO2 sheets to a value similar to that found for La1,85Sr0,15CuO4. The low valence _dT__c_/_dP_ = 0.073 K/kbar found for d = 0.017 would then be consistent with the increase in T_{c} relative to T0 in this sample as a result of internal stresses in the sample. In the _O_II phase found for d >= 0.07, where the Cu-O-Cu bond angles are 180deg, a _dT__c_/_dP_  0 may reflect charge transfer between La-8O_i_-LaO charge-reservoir layers and the CuO2 sheets. This latter question remains open, especially as hydrostatic pressure has essentially no effect on T0 for d >= 0.07. A _dT__c_/_dP_ < 0 for d = 0.066 is consistent with an inhibition of the static component of the segregation between the p  1/2 and superconductive d  0.07 phases in this sample.

Finally, the origin of the negative resistance observed just above T0 in the d = 0.047 sample after quenching or under pressure remains unresolved. We simply note here that d = 0.047 is at the upper boundary d_{s}  0.05 for diffusion-controlled phase segregation.

## Conclusions

From the experiments reported in this paper, we draw the following conclusions.

(1) In the system La2CuO4+_b_, the d interstitial oxygen atoms O_i_ per formula unit enter the La2CuO4 host structure as O_i_2- ions for smaller values of d, but in the range 0.054 <= d <= 0.066 there may be some electron transfer from the O_i_2- ions to the LaO2 sheets above a transition temperature T_{d} within a "_p_ = 1/2" phase. The extraordinary mobility (mobile down to 200 K) of the interstitial oxygen atoms suggests that the charge-transfer reaction

\[\delta{\text{O}}_{i}^{2 - } + ({\text{CuO}}_{2})^{(2 - 28) - } = 8{\text{O}}_{i}^{ - } + ({\text{CuO}}_{2})^{(2 - 8) - }\]

is not biased too strongly to the left, which allows oxygen diffusion to a neighboring site to be facilitated by an in-transit charge transfer. Ordering of the O_i_ at d = 0.070 appears to stabilize the left-hand side of reaction (2) relative to the right-hand side.

(2) An order-disorder transition of the O_i_ atoms occurs at a composition d_o_, where 0.066 < d_o_ < 0.070. The ordered phase has a T_{c} some 10 K higher than the disordered phase.

In the ordered phase, some O _2p_ states of the nonsuperconductive LaO-8O_i_-LaO layers may lie above E_{F} to make these layers act as "charge-reservoirs" vis a vis the CuO2 planes via the charge-transfer reaction of Eq. (2); but the small value of _dT__c_/_dP_ for d >= 0.070 suggests that any such charge transfer remains relatively small.

(3) In samples d >= 0.070, the "tail" in the _R_-vs-_T_ curve extending below T_{c}, as determined by a = 0, is to be attributed to liquid-state vortices.

(4) Below a critical temperature T_{s} = T_{s}(d), where _dT__s_/_d_d_ < 0, a diffusion-controlled phase segregation occurs in the temperature range 200 K < T < T_{s} where the O_i_ atoms are mobile. For a fixed d, the fraction of parent phase with d >= 0 and T_{N}  250 K (reduced from a maximum T_{N}  320 K in La2CuO4) grows with decreasing temperature as the oxygen content d_s_ of the d-rich phases increases to d_s_ (max)  0.05 at T_{s}  200 K.

(5) A d_o_ > d_s_(max) shows that the driving force for the phase segregation in the range 0 < d < 0.05 is not stabilization of a phase with ordered interstitial oxygen; the driving force is not structural, but of electronic or vibronic origin. The electronic normal state of the superconductive phase is thermodynamically distinguishable from the antiferromagnetic state of the parent phase.

(6) A competitive phase, distinguishable from the two superconductive phases stable at d >= 0.05 and d >= 0.070, is stable within the narrow compositional range 0.054 < d < 0.066, which lies in the domain of the disordered O1 structural phase field. The decrease in T_{c} to a minimum value within this narrow compositional range indicates that the competitive phase is most probably the nonsuperconductive p = 1/2 phase, which would appear as  a line phase at \delta  0.0625.

(7) A subtle transition appearing at T_{d}  47 K over the range 0\!<\!\delta\!<\!0.070 is nonsuperconductive and is suppressed by the application of hydrostatic pressure. This transition appears to be associated with the nonsuperconductive (p\!=\!\frac{1}{\delta}) competitive phase; it may represent a charge-transfer transition between the O_{i}^{-}/O_{i}^{2-} redox couple and the CuO_{2} planes.

(8) It is possible to monitor known phase segregations by observing changes in the temperature dependences of the resistance R and the Seebeck coefficient \alpha. Such monitoring showed that application of hydrostatic pressure suppresses the mobility of the O_{i} atoms. It also revealed an O_{i}-diffusion phase segregation occurring near room temperature in the narrow compositional range 0.054\!\leq\!\delta\!\leq\!0.066. The latter finding is consistent with a competitive line phase near \delta\!=\!0.0625 that is stable to above room temperature; segregation between it and the \delta\!=\!0.05 superconductive phase would then occur below T_{l} for 0.05\!<\!\delta\!<\!0.0625 and between it and the superconductive O_{\rm II} phase at \delta_{o} for 0.0625\!<\!\delta\!<\!\delta_{o}.

(9) The temperature dependences of R and \alpha below 150 K show anomalies consistent with the appearance of charge fluctuations in the interval T_{c}<T\!<\!T_{\rho}. We interpret this indirect evidence for the onset of charge fluctuations as a further manifestation of the influence of an electronically stabilized competitive (p\!=\!\frac{1}{\delta}) phase.

(10) The evolutions with 8 and T of R and \alpha in La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} are consistent with their evolutions with x and T in the system La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} if provision is made for the diffusion-controlled phase segregations occurring in the range T\!>\!200 K.

The indirect evidence for charge fluctuations in the range T_{c}\!<\!T\!<\!T_{\rho} for 0\!<\!\delta\!<\!\delta_{o} supports our earlier model [13] that the uniqueness of the normal state of the superconductive phase is the condensation of a correlation-polaron gas into a polaron liquid.
