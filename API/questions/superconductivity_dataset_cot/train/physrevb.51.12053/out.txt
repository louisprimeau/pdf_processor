###### Abstract

The flux-flow Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy} in untwinned YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.93} (YBCO) is determined from Hall and resistivity measurements with the current applied along the a and the b axes. We show that sign reversal results from competition between a positive quasiparticle current (\sim\!H) and a negative vortex-motion term (\sim\!1/H). The Hall drag coefficient in YBCO is measured to be \alpha(T)\!=\!-4.4\!\times\!10^{-8}(1\!-\!T/T_{c}) N s/m^{2} (75<T\!\!<93 K). In single-crystal La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, a similar decomposition into quasiparticle and vortex currents (both positive) is possible even though \sigma_{xy} shows no sign reversal.

pacs: 9 05.10.Jm, 75.10.Jm, 75.10.Jm The behavior of the flux-flow Hall effect in high-T_{c} superconductors is a challenging problem in the rich phenomenology of vortex dynamics in type-II superconductors. Of particular interest is the sign reversal observed in the Hall resistivity \rho_{yx} of most of the cuprates.[1, 2] Many models have been proposed to explain this anomaly.[3, 4, 5, 6] However, until recently, the crucial contribution of quasiparticle excitations to the observed current has not been appreciated.

Dorsey[5] and Kopnin, Ivlev, and Kalatsky[6] independently proposed that the sign reversal could arise if the quasiparticle and vortex Hall currents have opposite signs. Because of the additivity of the two currents, the simplest way to express the quasiparticle contribution is by the conductivity, viz.,

\[\sigma_{xy}=\sigma_{xy}^{n}+\sigma_{xy}^{f}\,,\] (1)

where \sigma_{xy} is the total conductivity and \sigma_{xy}^{n} (\sigma_{xy}^{f}) is the Hall conductivity of the quasiparticles (vortices). Following a suggestion by Geshkenbein and Larkin (GL),[7] Harris, Ong, and Yan (HOY)[8] extracted the Hall conductivity of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.93} (YBCO) measured in oblique fields and found striking agreement with the scaling relationship of GL. Further, HOY found that the vortex term \sigma_{xy}^{f} is negative at all fields and tilt angles. The additivity in Eq. (1) has also been tested by Samoilov, Ivanov, and Johansson[9] in Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta}, and by Ginsberg and Manson[10] on untwinned YBCO crystals. Harris _et al.[11]_ reported that, in high-purity 60-K YBCO crystals, \sigma_{xy} is negative below 40 K at all fields H up to \sim\!24 T with a field dependence that approaches \sim\!1/H at high fields. These experiments show that the sign reversal is a direct consequence of adding a positive term that increases with H to a negative term that varies as -1/H. A different analysis, based on additivity of the Hall angles, has been proposed by Kunchur _et al.[12]_

We report Hall measurements on two untwinned crystals of YBCO and a crystal of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (LSCO). In YBCO, the ratio of the resistivities \rho_{a} and \rho_{b}, measured with {\bf J}\|{\bf a} and {\bf J}\|{\bf b}, respectively, varies strongly with H and T in the mixed state. ({\bf J} is the current density; {\bf H}\|{\bf c} in all measurements.) To determine the Hall conductivity \sigma_{ab}, it is necessary to measure _both_\rho_{a} and \rho_{b}. We selected two untwinned, optimally doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.93} crystals (A and B) with closely similar electrical properties (caption of Fig. 1). The Hall resistivity \rho_{ba} (\rho_{ab}) and the resistivity \rho_{a} (\rho_{b}) were measured simultaneously in crystal A (B). The four quantities allow the Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy}\!=\!\sigma_{ab} to be calculated as \rho_{ba}\!/[\rho_{a}\rho_{b}\!-\!\rho_{ab}\rho_{ba}]. We also checked that the Onsager relation \rho_{ba}\!=\!-\rho_{ab} is accurately satisfied. Details of the crystal growth and detwinning are given elsewhere.[13] The La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (x\!=\!0.17) sample was cut from a large crystal grown using the traveling-solvent-floating-zone method. In LSCO, sign reversal in the Hall resistivity is absent, indicating that \sigma_{xy}^{n} and \sigma_{xy}^{f} are both positive.

We first discuss the anisotropy \rho_{b}/\rho_{a} in YBCO. As reported by Safar _et al._ and by Kwok _et al._,[14] the transition to the dissipative state is abrupt in untwinned crystals. In our crystals, the transition width is less than 0.2 K below 5 T but increases to \sim\!1 K above 9 T (Fig. 1, inset). In Fig. 1 we compare the resistivities by plotting the ratio \rho_{b}/\rho_{a} against T at selected fields. [To correct for a slight difference in T_{c}'s (0.3 K), we form the ratio \rho_{b}/\rho_{a} from resistivities measured at the same reduced temperature t\!=\!(T_{c}\!-\!T)/T_{c} in the two crystals.] Starting at low temperatures, the ratio \rho_{b}/\rho_{a} rises steeply, signaling the transition to the dissipative state in sample B. When T increases above T_{c}, the curves converge to the normal-state value[13](\rho_{b}^{N}/\rho_{a}^{N})\!=\!0.45, which is almost independent of field. Because \rho_{b}/\rho_{a} is sensitive to both H and T, the approximation \sigma_{ab}\!-\!\rho_{ba}/\rho_{a}^{2} is unreliable except within a few degrees of T_{c}. Interestingly, in the mixed state, \rho_{b}/\rho_{a} rises to values significantly higher than the normal-state value (before the onset of pinning drives it to zero). The enhancement implies that the anisotropy is weaker in the mixed state than in the normal state. This implies that the  chain conductance (which is responsible for the anisotropy above T_{c}) becomes less important relative to the conductance within the layers in the mixed state.

As in the resistivity, the onset of the Hall resistivity \rho_{yx}\!=\!\rho_{ba} is much sharper than observed in heavily twinned crystals, especially at temperatures above 84 K (Fig. 2, upper panel). In weak fields, \rho_{yx} initially decreases to a minimum, then changes sign before increasing linearly with H at high fields. This nonmonotonic behavior immediately simplifies when we convert \rho_{yx} into the Hall conductivity (Fig. 2, lower panel). In contrast to \rho_{yx}, \sigma_{xy} is always monotonic in field in YBCO.[8] The resistivities \rho_{xx} and \rho_{yx} decrease abruptly to zero when the vortex lattice is pinned, but \sigma_{xy} does not. In weak fields, \sigma_{xy} diverges in the negative direction while in high fields \sigma_{xy} asymptotically approaches a straight line with positive slope in H.

The viscous-drag (\eta) and Hall-drag (\alpha) coefficients are defined by the equation of motion \eta\mathbf{v}_{L}+\alpha\mathbf{v}_{L}\!\times\!\mathbf{z}\!=\!\phi_{0} \mathbf{J}\!\times\!\mathbf{z} (\mathbf{v}_{L} is the line velocity, \phi_{0} the flux quantum, and \mathbf{z}\!=\!\mathbf{B}/B). In terms of \sigma_{xy} and \alpha, the vortex conductivity elements are given by \sigma^{f}_{xx}\!=\!\eta/B\,\phi_{0} and \sigma^{f}_{xy}\!=\!\alpha/B\,\phi_{0}. Vinokur _et al._[15] have argued, on general grounds, that \alpha should be independent of field, so that \sigma^{f}_{xy} varies as 1/B. In weak fields the quasiparticle term \sigma^{h}_{xy} is linear in B. Hence, we expect the total Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy} to equal c_{1}B\!-\!c_{3}/B (with c_{1}\!,\!c_{3}\!\!>\!0). However, we find systematic deviation from this simple fit at low T and high fields.

An attractive explanation for the deviation is the scattering of quasiparticles (qp) by the vortices (at T\!\!>\!\!70 K, d-wave or anisotropic s-wave pairing implies a large qp population _outside_ the core). Microwave experiments in zero field suggest that the quasiparticle lifetime in YBCO increases sharply below T_{c}.[16, 17] This strong T dependence represents an inelastic scattering process that is very likely electronic in origin. In the mixed state, vortices act as "impurities" in the sea of quasiparticles. In addition to degrading the qp lifetime (described by the transport cross section \sigma_{\rm tr}), the vortices also cause asymmetric scattering (described by the transverse cross-section \sigma_{\rm r}).[18] The latter generates the qp Hall current. We may express the mean free path (mfp) in a field I_{\rm tot} by I_{\rm tot}^{-1}\!=\!t^{-1}\!=\!t_{\rm r}^{-1} where t is the mfp in zero field and l_{\rm r}^{-1}\!=\!\sigma_{\rm tr}|B|/\phi_{0}. Recalculating the quasiparticle current with I_{\rm tot} in place of l, we obtain for the total Hall conductivity[19]

\[\sigma_{xy}\!=\!c_{1}l^{2}H(1+l\sigma_{\rm tr}|B|/\phi_{0})^{-2}\!-\!c_{3}/H,\] (2)

where c_{1}\!=\!Y(T)(e^{2}k_{F}/2\pi h)\,\sigma_{\rm r}\!\!\!/\phi_{0}. The function Y(T)\!=\!(1/\pi k_{F})ds_{\rm d}\!\!\!/\,d\epsilon\!\!\!/\,d\epsilon\!\!\!/\, \sigma_{0}\!\!\!/\,d\epsilon\!\!\!/\,\sigma_{\rm k}\!\!\!/  steep increase in (the zero field) l below T_{c} is in striking agreement with the surface resistance results of Bonn _et al._[16] who inferred a qp conductivity that rises steeply to a peak near 40 K. The strong suppression of the inelastic scattering rate results in a qp lifetime enhancement that more than offsets the decrease in Y(T), so that \sigma_{xy}^{n} increases.[19]

A different perspective on \sigma_{xy} (versus T in fixed field) is shown in Fig. 3. The fan-out pattern illustrates the competition between the two currents of opposite sign that diverge with decreasing T. In low fields, the vortex Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy}^{f} dominates, so that \sigma_{xy} swings to large negative values. With increasing fields, however, \sigma_{xy}^{n} grows while |\sigma_{xy}^{f}| decreases. Thus, above 10 T, \sigma_{xy} increases monotonically with decreasing T. Using Eq. (2), we have separated out the two components at 14 T. With falling T, the quasiparticle \sigma_{xy}^{n} (squares) rises because of the increase in l. [Since \sigma_{xy}^{n} rises much faster than the T^{-3} normal-state behavior (broken line), it is incorrect to assume that the latter holds within the mixed state.[12] The vortex part \sigma_{xy}^{f} increases in magnitude linearly with the reduced temperature t as \sigma_{xy}^{f} = -2.1\times10^{7}/B (\Omega m)^{-1} (open circles). From this, we derive the temperature-dependent Hall-drag coefficient \alpha(T)= -4.4\times10^{-8}(1-T/T_{c}) Ns/m^{2}, (75<T<93 K). It is interesting to compare \alpha(T) with the Hall-drag coefficient \alpha_{xy} expected in the supereal regime where the vortex core moves (anti-)parallel with the applied current \mathbf{J}.[21] Setting \mathbf{v}_{x}=J/n_{s}e, we obtain \alpha_{x}= \pm\pi_{x}\phi_{0} which has the value \pm1.4\times10^{-7}(m^{*}/m_{0}) Ns/m^{2}. (n_{s} is the superconducting electron density and m_{0} the free mass; the in-plane penetration length \lambda is taken to be 1500 A.) Extrapolated to T\llT_{c} , \alpha(T) seems to imply a low-temperature value \alpha(0) an order of magnitude smaller than \alpha_{x} (taking m^{*}/m_{0}\sim2). However, we expect \alpha(T) to deviate strongly from linear-t dependence when the Hall angle diverges below \sim 50 K, as observed in 60-K YBCO.[11] [For comparison, in 60-K YBCO, \alpha\sim-1.3\times10^{-8} Ns/m^{2} at 37 K, while \alpha_{x}= -1.5\times10^{-7}(m^{*}/m_{0}) Ns/m^{2}.]

Flux-Hall measurements on single-crystal La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (x = 0.17) provide an interesting confirmation of Eq. (1) even though no sign-reversal anomaly occurs. The Hall resistivity \rho_{yx} (Fig. 4, upper panel) is positive (holelike) in fields up to 14 T and at temperatures down to 16 K. In comparison with the data for YBCO, its onset with field is much more gradual. When the resistivity is converted to the conductivity tensor (Fig. 4, lower panel), we find that in high fields \sigma_{xy} again approaches an asymptote that represents \sigma_{xy}^{n}. However, in contrast to YBCO, the vortex term \sigma_{xy}^{f} is positive. We have confirmed that \sigma_{xy}^{f} is positive at all angles including the orientation with HL c. Both \sigma_{xy}^{f} and \sigma_{xy}^{n} are clearly visible down to T= 26 K, while at lower temperatures \sigma_{xy}^{f} becomes dominant. The magnitude of \sigma_{xy}^{f} decreases with H just as in YBCO.

The data for the two cuprates, taken together, provide persuasive evidence for the additivity of the quasiparticle and vortex Hall currents, as expressed in Eq. (1). The simple

Figure 3: (Main panel) The total Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy} of untwinned YBCO vs temperature at fixed field (solid lines). Using Eq. (2), we separate out \sigma_{xy} at 14 T into \sigma_{xy}^{n} (squares) and \sigma_{xy}^{f}= -c_{3}/H (at 14 T). By fitting a straight line, we may express \sigma_{xy}^{f} as -(2.1\times10^{7})/B (\Omega m)^{-1}, which gives the value of \alpha(T) discussed in the text. Below T_{c}, \sigma_{xy}^{n} increases much more rapidly than the T^{-3} behavior in the normal state (dashed line). The inset shows l (mfp in zero field) and \sigma_{u} (transport cross section) obtained from the fit to Eq. (2).

  expedient of associating opposite signs to the two terms provides a rather natural explanation of the sign-reversal anomaly of the in-plane Hall response in YBCO. Similarly, the absence of sign reversal in LSCO also fits naturally within this explanation. The conductivity curves in Fig. 4 demonstrate clearly that \sigma_{xy}^{f} adds to a linearly increasing \sigma_{xy}^{n}, and that both are positive. These tests, together with verification of the GL scaling relations in a tilted-field experiment [8] and the low-temperature measurement showing that \sigma_{xy}\!-\!-1/H, [11] bolster the case for additivity of the Hall currents in the cuprates. Moreover, the high-field fits allow the determination of two important quasiparticle quantities, l and \sigma_{\rm tr}. The factors that fix the sign of \sigma_{xy}^{f} are not understood. Although a few microscopic calculations have addressed this issue,[22] there is considerable uncertainty about why \sigma_{xy}^{f} is negative while \sigma_{xy}^{n} is positive in YBCO. This difficulty is compounded by our observation that the two quantities are positive in LSCO.

###### Abstract

The flux-flow Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy} in untwinned YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.93} (YBCO) is determined from Hall and resistivity measurements with the current applied along the a and the b axes. We show that sign reversal results from competition between a positive quasiparticle current (\sim\!H) and a negative vortex-motion term (\sim\!1/H). The Hall drag coefficient in YBCO is measured to be \alpha(T)\!=\!-4.4\!\times\!10^{-8}(1\!-\!T/T_{c}) N s/m^{2} (75<T\!\!<93 K). In single-crystal La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, a similar decomposition into quasiparticle and vortex currents (both positive) is possible even though \sigma_{xy} shows no sign reversal.

We report Hall measurements on two untwinned crystals of YBCO and a crystal of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (LSCO). In YBCO, the ratio of the resistivities \rho_{a} and \rho_{b}, measured with {\bf J}\|{\bf a} and {\bf J}\|{\bf b}, respectively, varies strongly with H and T in the mixed state. ({\bf J} is the current density; {\bf H}\|{\bf c} in all measurements.) To determine the Hall conductivity \sigma_{ab}, it is necessary to measure _both_\rho_{a} and \rho_{b}. We selected two untwinned, optimally doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.93} crystals (A and B) with closely similar electrical properties (caption of Fig. 1). The Hall resistivity \rho_{ba} (\rho_{ab}) and the resistivity \rho_{a} (\rho_{b}) were measured simultaneously in crystal A (B). The four quantities allow the Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy}\!=\!\sigma_{ab} to be calculated as \rho_{ba}\!/[\rho_{a}\rho_{b}\!-\!\rho_{ab}\rho_{ba}]. We also checked that the Onsager relation \rho_{ba}\!=\!-\rho_{ab} is accurately satisfied. Details of the crystal growth and detwinning are given elsewhere.[13] The La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (x\!=\!0.17) sample was cut from a large crystal grown using the traveling-solvent-floating-zone method. In LSCO, sign reversal in the Hall resistivity is absent, indicating that \sigma_{xy}^{n} and \sigma_{xy}^{f} are both positive.

We first discuss the anisotropy \rho_{b}/\rho_{a} in YBCO. As reported by Safar _et al._ and by Kwok _et al._,[14] the transition to the dissipative state is abrupt in untwinned crystals. In our crystals, the transition width is less than 0.2 K below 5 T but increases to \sim\!1 K above 9 T (Fig. 1, inset). In Fig. 1 we compare the resistivities by plotting the ratio \rho_{b}/\rho_{a} against T at selected fields. [To correct for a slight difference in T_{c}'s (0.3 K), we form the ratio \rho_{b}/\rho_{a} from resistivities measured at the same reduced temperature t\!=\!(T_{c}\!-\!T)/T_{c} in the two crystals.] Starting at low temperatures, the ratio \rho_{b}/\rho_{a} rises steeply, signaling the transition to the dissipative state in sample B. When T increases above T_{c}, the curves converge to the normal-state value[13](\rho_{b}^{N}/\rho_{a}^{N})\!=\!0.45, which is almost independent of field. Because \rho_{b}/\rho_{a} is sensitive to both H and T, the approximation \sigma_{ab}\!-\!\rho_{ba}/\rho_{a}^{2} is unreliable except within a few degrees of T_{c}. Interestingly, in the mixed state, \rho_{b}/\rho_{a} rises to values significantly higher than the normal-state value (before the onset of pinning drives it to zero). The enhancement implies that the anisotropy is weaker in the mixed state than in the normal state. This implies that the  chain conductance (which is responsible for the anisotropy above T_{c}) becomes less important relative to the conductance within the layers in the mixed state.

As in the resistivity, the onset of the Hall resistivity \rho_{yx}\!=\!\rho_{ba} is much sharper than observed in heavily twinned crystals, especially at temperatures above 84 K (Fig. 2, upper panel). In weak fields, \rho_{yx} initially decreases to a minimum, then changes sign before increasing linearly with H at high fields. This nonmonotonic behavior immediately simplifies when we convert \rho_{yx} into the Hall conductivity (Fig. 2, lower panel). In contrast to \rho_{yx}, \sigma_{xy} is always monotonic in field in YBCO.[8] The resistivities \rho_{xx} and \rho_{yx} decrease abruptly to zero when the vortex lattice is pinned, but \sigma_{xy} does not. In weak fields, \sigma_{xy} diverges in the negative direction while in high fields \sigma_{xy} asymptotically approaches a straight line with positive slope in H.

The viscous-drag (\eta) and Hall-drag (\alpha) coefficients are defined by the equation of motion \eta\mathbf{v}_{L}+\alpha\mathbf{v}_{L}\!\times\!\mathbf{z}\!=\!\phi_{0} \mathbf{J}\!\times\!\mathbf{z} (\mathbf{v}_{L} is the line velocity, \phi_{0} the flux quantum, and \mathbf{z}\!=\!\mathbf{B}/B). In terms of \sigma_{xy} and \alpha, the vortex conductivity elements are given by \sigma^{f}_{xx}\!=\!\eta/B\,\phi_{0} and \sigma^{f}_{xy}\!=\!\alpha/B\,\phi_{0}. Vinokur _et al._[15] have argued, on general grounds, that \alpha should be independent of field, so that \sigma^{f}_{xy} varies as 1/B. In weak fields the quasiparticle term \sigma^{h}_{xy} is linear in B. Hence, we expect the total Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy} to equal c_{1}B\!-\!c_{3}/B (with c_{1}\!,\!c_{3}\!\!>\!0). However, we find systematic deviation from this simple fit at low T and high fields.

An attractive explanation for the deviation is the scattering of quasiparticles (qp) by the vortices (at T\!\!>\!\!70 K, d-wave or anisotropic s-wave pairing implies a large qp population _outside_ the core). Microwave experiments in zero field suggest that the quasiparticle lifetime in YBCO increases sharply below T_{c}.[16, 17] This strong T dependence represents an inelastic scattering process that is very likely electronic in origin. In the mixed state, vortices act as "impurities" in the sea of quasiparticles. In addition to degrading the qp lifetime (described by the transport cross section \sigma_{\rm tr}), the vortices also cause asymmetric scattering (described by the transverse cross-section \sigma_{\rm r}).[18] The latter generates the qp Hall current. We may express the mean free path (mfp) in a field I_{\rm tot} by I_{\rm tot}^{-1}\!=\!t^{-1}\!=\!t_{\rm r}^{-1} where t is the mfp in zero field and l_{\rm r}^{-1}\!=\!\sigma_{\rm tr}|B|/\phi_{0}. Recalculating the quasiparticle current with I_{\rm tot} in place of l, we obtain for the total Hall conductivity[19]

\[\sigma_{xy}\!=\!c_{1}l^{2}H(1+l\sigma_{\rm tr}|B|/\phi_{0})^{-2}\!-\!c_{3}/H,\] (2)

where c_{1}\!=\!Y(T)(e^{2}k_{F}/2\pi h)\,\sigma_{\rm r}\!\!\!/\phi_{0}. The function Y(T)\!=\!(1/\pi k_{F})ds_{\rm d}\!\!\!/\,d\epsilon\!\!\!/\,d\epsilon\!\!\!/\, \sigma_{0}\!\!\!/\,d\epsilon\!\!\!/\,\sigma_{\rm k}\!\!\!/  steep increase in (the zero field) l below T_{c} is in striking agreement with the surface resistance results of Bonn _et al._[16] who inferred a qp conductivity that rises steeply to a peak near 40 K. The strong suppression of the inelastic scattering rate results in a qp lifetime enhancement that more than offsets the decrease in Y(T), so that \sigma_{xy}^{n} increases.[19]

A different perspective on \sigma_{xy} (versus T in fixed field) is shown in Fig. 3. The fan-out pattern illustrates the competition between the two currents of opposite sign that diverge with decreasing T. In low fields, the vortex Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy}^{f} dominates, so that \sigma_{xy} swings to large negative values. With increasing fields, however, \sigma_{xy}^{n} grows while |\sigma_{xy}^{f}| decreases. Thus, above 10 T, \sigma_{xy} increases monotonically with decreasing T. Using Eq. (2), we have separated out the two components at 14 T. With falling T, the quasiparticle \sigma_{xy}^{n} (squares) rises because of the increase in l. [Since \sigma_{xy}^{n} rises much faster than the T^{-3} normal-state behavior (broken line), it is incorrect to assume that the latter holds within the mixed state.[12] The vortex part \sigma_{xy}^{f} increases in magnitude linearly with the reduced temperature t as \sigma_{xy}^{f} = -2.1\times10^{7}/B (\Omega m)^{-1} (open circles). From this, we derive the temperature-dependent Hall-drag coefficient \alpha(T)= -4.4\times10^{-8}(1-T/T_{c}) Ns/m^{2}, (75<T<93 K). It is interesting to compare \alpha(T) with the Hall-drag coefficient \alpha_{xy} expected in the supereal regime where the vortex core moves (anti-)parallel with the applied current \mathbf{J}.[21] Setting \mathbf{v}_{x}=J/n_{s}e, we obtain \alpha_{x}= \pm\pi_{x}\phi_{0} which has the value \pm1.4\times10^{-7}(m^{*}/m_{0}) Ns/m^{2}. (n_{s} is the superconducting electron density and m_{0} the free mass; the in-plane penetration length \lambda is taken to be 1500 A.) Extrapolated to T\llT_{c} , \alpha(T) seems to imply a low-temperature value \alpha(0) an order of magnitude smaller than \alpha_{x} (taking m^{*}/m_{0}\sim2). However, we expect \alpha(T) to deviate strongly from linear-t dependence when the Hall angle diverges below \sim 50 K, as observed in 60-K YBCO.[11] [For comparison, in 60-K YBCO, \alpha\sim-1.3\times10^{-8} Ns/m^{2} at 37 K, while \alpha_{x}= -1.5\times10^{-7}(m^{*}/m_{0}) Ns/m^{2}.]

Flux-Hall measurements on single-crystal La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (x = 0.17) provide an interesting confirmation of Eq. (1) even though no sign-reversal anomaly occurs. The Hall resistivity \rho_{yx} (Fig. 4, upper panel) is positive (holelike) in fields up to 14 T and at temperatures down to 16 K. In comparison with the data for YBCO, its onset with field is much more gradual. When the resistivity is converted to the conductivity tensor (Fig. 4, lower panel), we find that in high fields \sigma_{xy} again approaches an asymptote that represents \sigma_{xy}^{n}. However, in contrast to YBCO, the vortex term \sigma_{xy}^{f} is positive. We have confirmed that \sigma_{xy}^{f} is positive at all angles including the orientation with HL c. Both \sigma_{xy}^{f} and \sigma_{xy}^{n} are clearly visible down to T= 26 K, while at lower temperatures \sigma_{xy}^{f} becomes dominant. The magnitude of \sigma_{xy}^{f} decreases with H just as in YBCO.

The data for the two cuprates, taken together, provide persuasive evidence for the additivity of the quasiparticle and vortex Hall currents, as expressed in Eq. (1). The simple

Figure 3: (Main panel) The total Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy} of untwinned YBCO vs temperature at fixed field (solid lines). Using Eq. (2), we separate out \sigma_{xy} at 14 T into \sigma_{xy}^{n} (squares) and \sigma_{xy}^{f}= -c_{3}/H (at 14 T). By fitting a straight line, we may express \sigma_{xy}^{f} as -(2.1\times10^{7})/B (\Omega m)^{-1}, which gives the value of \alpha(T) discussed in the text. Below T_{c}, \sigma_{xy}^{n} increases much more rapidly than the T^{-3} behavior in the normal state (dashed line). The inset shows l (mfp in zero field) and \sigma_{u} (transport cross section) obtained from the fit to Eq. (2).

  expedient of associating opposite signs to the two terms provides a rather natural explanation of the sign-reversal anomaly of the in-plane Hall response in YBCO. Similarly, the absence of sign reversal in LSCO also fits naturally within this explanation. The conductivity curves in Fig. 4 demonstrate clearly that \sigma_{xy}^{f} adds to a linearly increasing \sigma_{xy}^{n}, and that both are positive. These tests, together with verification of the GL scaling relations in a tilted-field experiment [8] and the low-temperature measurement showing that \sigma_{xy}\!-\!-1/H, [11] bolster the case for additivity of the Hall currents in the cuprates. Moreover, the high-field fits allow the determination of two important quasiparticle quantities, l and \sigma_{\rm tr}. The factors that fix the sign of \sigma_{xy}^{f} are not understood. Although a few microscopic calculations have addressed this issue,[22] there is considerable uncertainty about why \sigma_{xy}^{f} is negative while \sigma_{xy}^{n} is positive in YBCO. This difficulty is compounded by our observation that the two quantities are positive in LSCO.
