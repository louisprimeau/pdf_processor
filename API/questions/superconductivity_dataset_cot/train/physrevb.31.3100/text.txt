###### Abstract

Spisical Review is a first-principles study of the properties of the actinide alloys. The actinide properties of the actinide alloys are measured in the range \(0.01<\mu\)m\(<1.5\), \(0.00<\mu\)m\(<1.5\), and \(0.00<\mu\)m\(<1.5\). The actinide properties of the actinide alloys are measured in the range \(0.01<\mu\)m\(<1.5\), \(0.00<\mu\)m\(<1.5\), and \(0.00<\mu\)m\(<1.

 orbit scattering, the actual gradients are about \(\sim 6\)% higher than the visual values. The critical-field gradients, together with data on \(T_{e}\) and \(\rho\), are listed in Table 1. The slope \(-\left(dH_{e2}/dT\right)T_{e}=44\) kOe/K in U\({}_{85}\),C014,3 is the largest observed in bulk glassy superconductors.

In the dirty limit, one can express the renormalized density of states at the Fermi level \(N^{\star}(0)\) in the following form:[3]

\[N^{\star}(0) = -\left(9.46\times 10^{-7}\right)\frac{M}{\rho d}\left[\frac{dH_{e2}} {dT}\right]r_{e}\] (1) \[= -\left(9.46\times 10^{-7}\right)\frac{M}{mr}\left[\frac{dH_{e2}} {dT}\right]r_{e}\;\;,\]

where \(N^{\star}(0)\) is given in states/eV atom when \(M\), the molecular weight, is in grams; \(d\), the density in g/cm3; \(\rho\), the normal-state resistivity, in \(\Omega\) cm; and \(dH_{e2}/dT\), the field gradient, in kOe/K. Density is taken to be the gram-atomic mass \(\bar{M}\) to gram-atomic volume \(\bar{V}\) ratio, where \(\bar{V}=\bar{M}/d\). This procedure is demonstrated to yield values in excellent agreement (to within \(\sim 1\)%) with experimental results in metal-metal glasses.[1, 6] Using the density and mass per unit length (\(m\)) of the samples, resistivity \(\rho\) can be calculated from the sample cross-sectional area. The thickness of the samples is also measured by an optical microscope. Metallographically polished cross sections are being used in the measurement. Agreement to within 5% between the calculated and measured thickness is obtained. The resistance per unit length \(r\) is a well-defined quantity. Thus, the values of \(N^{\star}(0)\) for our alloys can be calculated according to expression (1). They are listed in Table 1. To provide a comparison of the electronic properties between the presently studied (\(Gd\)) (\(5f\)) alloys and the (\(4d\)) (\(5d\)) alloys, the maximum \(N^{\star}(0)\) values representative of the latter series are also included. Again, the values of \(\left(dH_{e2}/dT\right)\) at \(T_{e}\) have been corrected to obtain the actual values.[3] In order to give a systematic comparison, all \(N^{\star}(0)\) values except one (Zr\({}_{70}\)Fe\({}_{30}\)) are derived from critical-field data. It is seen that the uranium-rich alloys have \(N^{\star}(0)\) values two to three times those of the other alloys. This can be correlated with the presence of the \(5f\) band in the uranium alloys. When expressed in the same unit, the \(N^{\star}(0)\) value obtained for

  the U85,Fe143 (= U6Fe) glass is similar to that determined from specific-heat measurement for thin-film glassy U6Fe.7 This is ~ 35% lower than that determined for crystalline U6Fe.8

Rietschel and Winter,9 and Orlando and Beasley10 have proposed that spin fluctuation can affect the superconducting properties in some refractory metals and their compounds. The inverse correlation (low _Te_, large _N_*(0)] observed in the uranium-rich glasses suggests that these materials are exchange-enhanced paramagnetic superconductors. The anomalous behavior in _r_(_T_) (Fig. 1) is also consistent with this notion. In fact, the electron-paramagnon scattering mechanism can lead to negative temperature coefficients of resistivity (TCR).11 The resistivity is then given by \(\rho = \rho_{0}[1 - (T/T_{\rm s})^{2}\rbrack\), where _Ts_ is the order of the spin-fluctuation temperature _T_st. It is difficult to separate the magnetic contribution from the nonmagnetic one in our uranium alloys. The magnitudes of change in resistivity D_r_=_r_(4.2 K) - _r_(300 K) = 4 to 6 \(m\) m cm, however, are comparable to those observed in g-U alloys of the body-centered cubic structure.12 Other nearly magnetic actinide (e.g., Np, Pu) alloys also show decreasing \(r\) at increasing temperature which can be described by the paramagnon model.13 Incidentally, g-U alloys also are superconductors with _Te_  2 K.14 It should be mentioned that in amorphous simple metal alloys of Mg-Zn with low resistivity (~ 60 \(m\) m cm), negative TCR were also observed at higher temperatures followed by the occurrence of maxima in _r_(_T_) at decreasing temperatures.15 The existence of negative TCR over the entire temperature range (_T_  _Te_) in the uranium alloys is definitely unusual for low-resistivity metallic glasses.

One can perform a semiquantitative analysis to obtain the relevant superconducting parameters for the actinide alloys. By including the effect of spin fluctuations in the strong coupling theory, the following equations are obtained:16,17

\[T_{e} = \frac{\Theta_{D}}{1.45}\,\exp\left( - \frac{1 + \lambda_{e\text{-ph}} + \lambda_{d}}{\lambda_{e\text{-ph}} - \lambda_{d} - \mu^{\ast}} \right)\,\,\,,\]

\[\lambda_{d} = \frac{9}{2}\bar{T}\ln\left[ 1 + \frac{P_{\bar{1}}^{2}}{12}\frac{\bar{T}}{(1 - \bar{T})} \right]\,\,\,,\]

\[N^{\ast}(0) = N(0)(1 + \lambda_{e\text{-ph}} + \lambda_{\text{sf}})\,\,\,,\]

\[\bar{T} = N(0)I\,\,\,\,,\]

where Ph_D_ is the Debye temperature, _l_*ph and _l_sf are the electron-phonon and electron-electron (spin fluctuation) parameters, respectively, \(P\)1 is a momentum cutoff parameter, _N_(0) is the bare density of states, \(I\) is the electron-electron correlation parameter, and _m_* is taken to be 0.13. Values of Ph_D_ for amorphous transition-metal alloys of composition \(A\)100-_xB_x (_x_ < 25) are usually 30-40% lower than those found in crystalline metals \(A\).18,19 These empirical results will be used to estimate Ph_D_ for the actinide alloys. For amorphous U85,Fe143, Ph_D_(_t_ = 140 K) was determined from specific-heat measurement.7 For alloys taken from the literature (Table I), the Ph_D_ values are known. Without susceptibility data, values of the two parameters \(I\) and \(P\)12 are extrapolated from the transition-metal series. In practice, \(P\)12 is always a fitting parameter. The choices of \(P\)12 and \(I\) for transition metals have been discussed in Ref. 3. In summary, _I_(_t_ = 0.35 eV) is essentially constant for transition metals according to Janak's calculation,20 the cutoff parameters (_P_12)_3\(d\)  1.2 and (_P_12)_4\(d\)  2. A rough estimate of electron and electron-phonon parameters will be made by taking (_P_12)_d_  1 and \(I\) = 0.35 eV. Since the electron band in U is narrow,21 (_P_12)_d_sf_ is expected to be even smaller. In fact, one can use the results of Ref. 8 (susceptibility data) to obtain a reasonable estimate of the values of the pair [_P_12]. It is then noted that even for \(P\)12 = 0.5, \(\bar{T}\) is already close to unity, and _N_(0) = 1.1 states/eV atom which is too low for U.21 Decreasing \(P\)12 to 0.35 (arbitrary value) yields \(\bar{T} \simeq 0.85\) (_I_ = 0.4 eV) and _N_(0) = 2.1 states/eV atom. It will be seen that the latter is similar to those found in amorphous U alloys. In Table II, a comparison of parameters for two values of \(P\)12 for U alloys is given. One should bear in mind that the values listed are only rough estimates since these results depend on the validity of Eqs. (2) and (3). It is seen that the Stoner enhancement factors \(S\) = 1/(1 - \(\bar{T}\)) are comparable to that found in crystalline U6Fe.8 For the Th alloys, the values are comparable to those found in the _4d_ and _5d_ alloys (Table I). Thus, the uranium-rich glasses are simultaneously exchange-enhanced paramagnets and superconductors. These materials provide ideal systems for studying the interaction of strong spin fluctuation and superconductivity in amorphous systems independent of particular crystalline structures.
