The anion doping effect on the superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) of HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} has been determined with a wide T_{c} variation. We found a parabolic variation of T_{c} with \delta over the entire range of superconductivity. Remarkably, the dependence of T_{c} on p (the number of holes per CuO_{2}) has richer features: for \delta \leq 0.28, T_{c} is parabolic in p, but with an unusual prefactor and p = 0.72\delta, giving significantly less than two holes per oxygen; and for \delta > 0.28, a drastic departure from the parabolic T_{c}(p) occurs. Implications for the occurrence of superconductivity in this material are discussed.

Many cuprates are known to undergo the insulator \rightarrow superconductor \rightarrow "normal" metal (I\rightarrowS\rightarrow NM) transition as the carrier concentration (n) of these compounds increases continuously with doping. Superconductivity usually occurs only over a limited n range n_{\rm min} < n < n_{\rm max} and the superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) rises above 1 K at n = n_{\rm min}, peaks with a T_{c} = T_{c}^{\rm max} at an optimal n (n_{\rm op}) and drops back to 1 K at n = n_{\rm max}. In an attempt to understand the occurrence of high-temperature superconductivity (HTS), systematic trends of evolution of HTS with various physical parameters have been sought in these compounds as the I\rightarrowS\rightarrowNM transition is induced by doping. Several universal relationships between T_{c} and n were reported over the last few years, as summarized schematically in Fig. 1. Based on muon-spin-rotation (nSR) measurements, Uemura _et al._1 observed a linear T_{c}-n_{s}/m * relation (where n_{s} is n in the superconducting state and m * the effective mass of the carrier in the unit of free-electron mass) for wide variety of HTS's with n \leq n_{\rm op} [Fig. 1(a)]. After examining the pressure effect on T_{c}, we2 proposed a universal T_{c}-X dependence (where X is a yet-to-be determined parameter that depends on n, m *, and pressure), qualitatively extending the observation of Uemura _et al._1 to n > n_{\rm op}. On the other hand, Presland _et al._3 found that T_{c} /T_{c}^{\rm max} varies parabolically with the number of carriers per CuO_{2} (p), i.e., T_{c} /T_{c}^{\rm max} = 1 - 82.6(p - 0.16)2 where p is determined from valence balance3 or the thermoelectric power (TEP) measurements at room temperature.4, 5 Later, Zhang and Sato6 proposed a universal T_{c} /T_{c}^{\rm max}-p relation where T_{c} /T_{c}^{\rm max} exhibits a plateau for 0.12 \leq p \leq 0.25, following the analysis of a number of selected data sets [Fig. 1(c)]. Very recently, Niedermayer _et al._5 and Uemura _et al._7 found that as n (which is \propto 8) increases, although the T_{c} of the overdoped (n > n_{\rm op}) Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} decreases as expected, n_{s} /m * determined by \muSR decreases instead, in strong contrast to all the T_{c}(p) relations mentioned above. By combining results of the underdoped (n < n_{\rm op}) YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.5+\delta} and La_{2-x}Sr_{x}O_{4+\delta},1 a double-valued T_{c}-n_{s}/m * relation was proposed5 [Fig. 1(d)].

Although all universal relations shown in Fig. 1 appear to be an extension of the linear T_{c}-n_{s}/m * relation for n < n_{\rm op} observed by Uemura _et al._,1 the details of the models are different on the overdoped side and may depend on the particular method (e.g., cation substitution, titration, oxygen content, or TEP) used to extract p. This

 is not surprising, since many factors, such as self-doping, cation stoichiometry, and defects, may affect these parameters differently. Furthermore, in no case has the obtained T_{\rm c} covered full range through anion doping only. It is known[8] that cation substitution can introduce disorders that may complicate the T_{\rm c}(p) dependence.

In this paper, we report on a systematic study of the T_{\rm c} evolution of HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} (Hg 1:2:0:1) over a wide anion-doping range 0.03\leq\delta\leq 0.4. We have measured T_{\rm c} together with \delta which was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the carrier concentration p from TEP at 290 K, and the lattice parameters a and c. We observed that T_{\rm c} can be changed parabolically from 1 K to a T_{\rm c}^{\rm max}=97 K and back to \sim 20 K as \delta increases from 0.03 to 0.4. This corresponds to a wide variation of T_{\rm c}/T_{\rm c}^{\rm max} achieved by oxygen doping alone. T_{\rm c} was found to change also with p parabolically, i.e., T_{\rm c} = 97 K [1-50(p-0.16)^{2}], similarly to the relation previously reported,[5] but only when p is between 0.03 and 0.22. Further oxygenation leads to an increase of TEP at 290 K and therefore a reduction of p while T_{\rm c} continues to decrease. Such a deviation of T_{\rm c} from the proposed correlation for \delta > 0.28 is also accompanied by an unexpected change in the slope of c -\delta. The observations will be compared with the universal relations previously proposed and discussed in terms of the electronic structure of Hg 1:2:0:1.

The Hg 1:2:0:1 samples investigated here were prepared by the controlled solid-vapor reaction technique. Details of the technique have been published elsewhere.[9] In short, Hg 1:2:0:1 is synthesized by reacting a precursor pellet of Ba_{2}CuO_{x} and a composite Hg source together. The precursor pellet is obtained by repeatedly heating and pulverizing a mixture of appropriate amounts of BaO and CuO in an alumina crucible in a flowing mixed gas of Ar:O at a ratio of 4:1 at 930 degC for a total of 24 h. The composite Hg source used in this study was a prereacted Hg 1:2:0:1 pellet made by compacting the thoroughly mixed HgO and pulverized precursor powder. A small precursor pellet and a large composite Hg source in a ratio of \sim 1:3 are sealed inside an evacuated quartz tube, heated to 810 degC and kept at this temperature for 8 h before being cooled to room temperature. Samples with different \delta are obtained by heating the as-synthesized samples at different temperatures and O pressures for appropriate periods of time.[10] To reach the underdoped region, the sample was heated in a vacuum of \sim 2 x 10^{-6} torr at a temperature between 250-500 degC for 20-80 h. For the overdoped samples, the as-synthesized compound was heated in a 1-500 bar O atmosphere between 240 and 400 degC for 10-240 h. The best homogeneous heavily overdoped samples were made at low temperatures which facilitate oxygenation. Heat treatment at temperatures above 500 degC in vacuum resulted in a partial decomposition of the compound. \delta was measured by TGA and the neutron powder diffraction (NPD), and the cation composition of the samples was determined by NPD, inductance coupled plasma (ICP), and wet-chemistry analysis. The structure was characterized by powder x-ray diffraction and NPD. The dc magnetic susceptibility (\chi) was measured as a function of temperature using a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer, and the electrical resistivity (\rho) was measured using the standard four-lead technique. The TEP was measured with a resolution of \sim 0.1 \muV/K (Ref. [11]) in the temperature region of interest.

All samples investigated display a single phase of Hg 1:2:0:1 within the resolution of our x-ray diffraction (\pm5%) and neutron diffraction (\pm5%). The cation stoichiometry in the as-synthesized Hg 1:2:0:1 is Hg:Ba:Cu=0.98:2:1, as shown by NPD,[12] in contrast to the value \sim 0.7:2:1 as determined by the ICP technique and the wet-chemical method.[10] The microprobe method, which is commonly used to determine the cation ratios, failed because of sample surface degradation induced by polishing. The Hg content was the same after annealing at lower temperatures (\leq 300 degC) over short periods of time (\leq 10 h), but apparently decreased up to \sim 5% after prolonged heat treatment (> 100 h) at high temperatures (400 degC) based on our TGA and NPD data. This small Hg loss did not result in any significant irreversible change in T_{\rm c} (< 1 K) or superconducting volume fraction (\leq 5%) according to the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization results on powder samples and thus, is not expected to affect the discussion that follows. However, it does lead to an irreversible increase in \rho (up to \sim 15% for the most heavily overdoped sample with a T_{\rm c} \sim 20 K) due to the degradation of the grain boundaries. Therefore, exact \rho evolution with oxygenation is yet to be determined.

The \rho(T) and \chi(T) of the Hg 1:2:0:1 samples were carefully measured after various heat treatments. In general, the removal of oxygen results in a rapid \rho increase for the underdoped samples with \delta < \delta_{\rm op} but only a slow \rho increase for the overdoped ones with \delta > \delta_{\rm op}, where \delta_{\rm op} = 0.22 is the \delta at the optimal doping level. The superconducting signal (\Delta\chi) of all samples was found to be > 5% and > 20% of a perfect superconductor as determined in the field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) modes, respectively, demonstrating bulk superconductivity in all samples examined. However, it should be pointed out that \Delta\chi decreases with the decrease in T_{\rm c} in both the \delta < \delta_{\rm op} and \delta > \delta_{\rm op} regions. This could be attributed to the increase of the penetration depth. The superconducting transition of these samples was relatively narrow with a width < 5 K. The T_{\rm c} so obtained was found to depend on \delta parabolically as 97 K[1 - 26(\delta - \delta_{\rm op})^{2}] where \delta_{\rm op} = 0.22 over the entire doping range of 0.03 \leq\delta\leq 0.4 as displayed in Fig. 2.

The TEP(_T_)'s of samples with different \delta's were determined. A few examples are shown in Fig. 3, inset. In general, a \delta increase shifts the TEP(_T_) curve downward in parallel, rapidly for samples with \delta < \delta_{\rm op} but only slowly for those with \delta > \delta_{\rm op}, similar to that observed previously.[4] However, the TEP(_T_) reaches a minimum at \delta = 0.28, and further oxygenation shifts the whole TEP(_T_) curve upward instead. Following the universal correspondence of room-temperature TEP with p, proposed by Obertelli _et al._,[4] the p's of the samples with  different \delta's were determined. The bond-valence summation method was also used to determine p. The value of the as-synthesized samples obtained is \sim 0.17, which compares well with the value of 0.15 as determined by the thermoelectric power method. As shown in Fig. 3, T_{c} was found to vary with p parabolically as 97 K[1 - 50(_p_ - 0.16)2] as T_{c} rises from 1 K to the T_{c}^{\max} = 97 K in the underdoped region and then decreases to \sim 75 K in the overdoped region. This T_{c} region where the parabolic T_{c}-p relationship holds corresponds to a \delta range, varying from 0.03 to 0.28. A deviation from the parabolic T_{c}(p) dependence occurs for T_{c} < 75 K in the overdoped region, corresponding to \delta > 0.28.

The lattice parameters a and c were also determined for samples with different \delta's. c was found to decrease continuously with \delta increase for \delta < 0.28 but to change only very slightly with further increase of \delta, as shown in Fig. 4. The break in the c (\delta) curve coincides with the departure from the parabolic T_{c}(p) behavior at \delta \sim 0.28.

The T_{c} changes with \delta parabolically (Fig. 2) as observed previously in other cuprates HTS's.^{1-5} The T_{c}(p) = 97 K[1 - 50(_p_ - 0.16)2] observed for Hg 1:2:0:1 shown in Fig. 3 is in qualitative agreement with the parabolic universal relation T_{c}(p) = T_{c}^{\max}[1 - 82.6(_p_ - 0.16)2] where p is determined from the same TEP measurements at room temperatures.^{3-5} It is particularly true that T_{c}^{\max} of Hg 1:2:0:1 occurs at the same p = 0.16 as for all other cuprates HTS's. However, the prefactor of 50 observed here is smaller than the 82.6 for other HTS's. The extrapolated superconducting range of \Delta p = 0.28 for Hg 1:2:0:1 is therefore significantly greater than that of 0.22 for other HTS's.^{3,4} The difference observed here appears to exceed that arising from the uncertainty \pm0.015 of p for the cuprates examined in Ref. [4]. Our results may therefore suggest that the charge reservoir can affect T_{c} through roles other than the well-accepted one as a carrier supplier.^{13} The observed T_{c}(\delta) and T_{c}(p) gave p = 0.728\pm p_{0} with p_{0} = 0 \pm 0.01, implying that Hg 1:2:0:1 is not self-doped, as suggested by the band-structure calculation of Novikov and Freeman.^{14} This p-\delta relation disagrees with the ionic model, which predicts p = 28, giving two carriers per oxygen. This can be attributed to the strong covalent bonding between Hg and O(4) in the HgO_{3} layer recently proposed by Singh and Pickett.^{15} Details will be published elsewhere.^{16}

For \delta > 0.28, T_{c}(p) is no longer parabolic as shown in Fig. 3. The dramatic departure from the parabolic T_{c}(p) of Hg 1:2:0:1 appears for T_{c} < 75 K or \delta > 0.28 in the overdoped region. In spite of the continuous increase of \delta and the continuous decrease of T_{c} and \rho(T), p shows a small but distinct decrease in a contrast to expectation. This p decrease coincides with the reverse trend of TEP and c various in \delta \geq 0.28 (Figs. 3 and 4). The observed T_{c}(p) in Hg 1:2:0:1 for p > 0.22 is qualitatively similar to the T_{c}(n_{s}/m^{*}) in Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} reported by Niedermayer _et al.^{5}_ and Uemura _et al.^{7}_ in the overdoping region, which has been attributed to the strong depairing effect of the extra carriers,^{5} to the failure of scaling between normal state n and n_{s}, or to an increase in m^{*}.^{7} However, it should be noted that a parabolic T_{c}(p) was detected for Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} throughout the overdoped region. The departure of T_{c}(p) of Hg 1:2:0:1 with \delta > 0.28 from the parabolic T_{c}(p) behavior may therefore arise from a different cause. It has been observed that the lat

  tice parameter c contracts in all double Tl(Bi)-layer HTS's but expands in the single Tl-layer compounds, because of the different sites in the compound that oxygen centers.3 The nearly constant c with oxygenation d > 0.28 observed in Hg 1:2:0:1 (Fig. 4) is very different from the continuous decrease with d for d < 0.28. This may imply that there are two different types of sites for oxygen to enter Hg 1:2:0:1, one presumably in the HgO8 layers and the other off the HgO8 layers. The latter will be occupied when d is large. It follows that although excess O atoms in both sites suppress T_{c} and possibly the superconducting condensate n_{s} in the overdoped region, they contribute to the transport properties in the normal state differently, i.e., one enhances TEP(_T_) and the other suppresses TEP(_T_). It will not be surprising if oxygen in the different sites will also be discovered to have different effects on other superconducting properties, such as pinning. To test the above conjecture, several experiments on the sites of excess oxygen, the superconducting concentrates, and field effects on _kh_ of samples with different _d_'s are underway.

In conclusion, we have carried out a systematic study on the O-doping effect on Hg 1:2:0:1 over a wide anion-doping range. The T_{c} was found to vary parabolically with d throughout the doping range where T_{c} rises from 1 to 97 K and loops back to 20 K with a continuous d increase, which is in agreement with the previous reports. For d < 0.28, T_{c} was observed to vary also parabolically with p, but with a prefactor different from other cuprate HTS's, with p = 0.728, significantly less than the expected two carries per oxygen. This implies a possibly important role, other than that of carrier supplier to the CuO2 layers, of the charge reservoir in inducing superconductivity in layered cuprates. However, T_{c} departs from the parabolic T_{c}(_p_) relation known for other HTS's for d > 0.28, coinciding with the anomalous _c_(_d_) behavior detected. While the departure observed here in Hg 1:2:0:1 appears to be similar for T_{c}(_n__s_/_m_ *) reported recently in Tl2Ba2CuO6+_d_, our observation suggests that excess oxygen may have entered different sites when d > 0.28 and that oxygen in different sites may influence the properties of the compounds in their normal and superconducting states differently. The results also suggest that T_{c}(_p_) may depend on the specifics of the material system, particularly in the heavily overdoped region, and that no universal relation of the type previously suggested exists.

The anion doping effect on the superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) of HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} has been determined with a wide T_{c} variation. We found a parabolic variation of T_{c} with \delta over the entire range of superconductivity. Remarkably, the dependence of T_{c} on p (the number of holes per CuO_{2}) has richer features: for \delta \leq 0.28, T_{c} is parabolic in p, but with an unusual prefactor and p = 0.72\delta, giving significantly less than two holes per oxygen; and for \delta > 0.28, a drastic departure from the parabolic T_{c}(p) occurs. Implications for the occurrence of superconductivity in this material are discussed.

Many cuprates are known to undergo the insulator \rightarrow superconductor \rightarrow "normal" metal (I\rightarrowS\rightarrow NM) transition as the carrier concentration (n) of these compounds increases continuously with doping. Superconductivity usually occurs only over a limited n range n_{\rm min} < n < n_{\rm max} and the superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) rises above 1 K at n = n_{\rm min}, peaks with a T_{c} = T_{c}^{\rm max} at an optimal n (n_{\rm op}) and drops back to 1 K at n = n_{\rm max}. In an attempt to understand the occurrence of high-temperature superconductivity (HTS), systematic trends of evolution of HTS with various physical parameters have been sought in these compounds as the I\rightarrowS\rightarrowNM transition is induced by doping. Several universal relationships between T_{c} and n were reported over the last few years, as summarized schematically in Fig. 1. Based on muon-spin-rotation (nSR) measurements, Uemura _et al._1 observed a linear T_{c}-n_{s}/m * relation (where n_{s} is n in the superconducting state and m * the effective mass of the carrier in the unit of free-electron mass) for wide variety of HTS's with n \leq n_{\rm op} [Fig. 1(a)]. After examining the pressure effect on T_{c}, we2 proposed a universal T_{c}-X dependence (where X is a yet-to-be determined parameter that depends on n, m *, and pressure), qualitatively extending the observation of Uemura _et al._1 to n > n_{\rm op}. On the other hand, Presland _et al._3 found that T_{c} /T_{c}^{\rm max} varies parabolically with the number of carriers per CuO_{2} (p), i.e., T_{c} /T_{c}^{\rm max} = 1 - 82.6(p - 0.16)2 where p is determined from valence balance3 or the thermoelectric power (TEP) measurements at room temperature.4, 5 Later, Zhang and Sato6 proposed a universal T_{c} /T_{c}^{\rm max}-p relation where T_{c} /T_{c}^{\rm max} exhibits a plateau for 0.12 \leq p \leq 0.25, following the analysis of a number of selected data sets [Fig. 1(c)]. Very recently, Niedermayer _et al._5 and Uemura _et al._7 found that as n (which is \propto 8) increases, although the T_{c} of the overdoped (n > n_{\rm op}) Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} decreases as expected, n_{s} /m * determined by \muSR decreases instead, in strong contrast to all the T_{c}(p) relations mentioned above. By combining results of the underdoped (n < n_{\rm op}) YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.5+\delta} and La_{2-x}Sr_{x}O_{4+\delta},1 a double-valued T_{c}-n_{s}/m * relation was proposed5 [Fig. 1(d)].

Although all universal relations shown in Fig. 1 appear to be an extension of the linear T_{c}-n_{s}/m * relation for n < n_{\rm op} observed by Uemura _et al._,1 the details of the models are different on the overdoped side and may depend on the particular method (e.g., cation substitution, titration, oxygen content, or TEP) used to extract p. This

 is not surprising, since many factors, such as self-doping, cation stoichiometry, and defects, may affect these parameters differently. Furthermore, in no case has the obtained T_{\rm c} covered full range through anion doping only. It is known[8] that cation substitution can introduce disorders that may complicate the T_{\rm c}(p) dependence.

In this paper, we report on a systematic study of the T_{\rm c} evolution of HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} (Hg 1:2:0:1) over a wide anion-doping range 0.03\leq\delta\leq 0.4. We have measured T_{\rm c} together with \delta which was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the carrier concentration p from TEP at 290 K, and the lattice parameters a and c. We observed that T_{\rm c} can be changed parabolically from 1 K to a T_{\rm c}^{\rm max}=97 K and back to \sim 20 K as \delta increases from 0.03 to 0.4. This corresponds to a wide variation of T_{\rm c}/T_{\rm c}^{\rm max} achieved by oxygen doping alone. T_{\rm c} was found to change also with p parabolically, i.e., T_{\rm c} = 97 K [1-50(p-0.16)^{2}], similarly to the relation previously reported,[5] but only when p is between 0.03 and 0.22. Further oxygenation leads to an increase of TEP at 290 K and therefore a reduction of p while T_{\rm c} continues to decrease. Such a deviation of T_{\rm c} from the proposed correlation for \delta > 0.28 is also accompanied by an unexpected change in the slope of c -\delta. The observations will be compared with the universal relations previously proposed and discussed in terms of the electronic structure of Hg 1:2:0:1.

The Hg 1:2:0:1 samples investigated here were prepared by the controlled solid-vapor reaction technique. Details of the technique have been published elsewhere.[9] In short, Hg 1:2:0:1 is synthesized by reacting a precursor pellet of Ba_{2}CuO_{x} and a composite Hg source together. The precursor pellet is obtained by repeatedly heating and pulverizing a mixture of appropriate amounts of BaO and CuO in an alumina crucible in a flowing mixed gas of Ar:O at a ratio of 4:1 at 930 degC for a total of 24 h. The composite Hg source used in this study was a prereacted Hg 1:2:0:1 pellet made by compacting the thoroughly mixed HgO and pulverized precursor powder. A small precursor pellet and a large composite Hg source in a ratio of \sim 1:3 are sealed inside an evacuated quartz tube, heated to 810 degC and kept at this temperature for 8 h before being cooled to room temperature. Samples with different \delta are obtained by heating the as-synthesized samples at different temperatures and O pressures for appropriate periods of time.[10] To reach the underdoped region, the sample was heated in a vacuum of \sim 2 x 10^{-6} torr at a temperature between 250-500 degC for 20-80 h. For the overdoped samples, the as-synthesized compound was heated in a 1-500 bar O atmosphere between 240 and 400 degC for 10-240 h. The best homogeneous heavily overdoped samples were made at low temperatures which facilitate oxygenation. Heat treatment at temperatures above 500 degC in vacuum resulted in a partial decomposition of the compound. \delta was measured by TGA and the neutron powder diffraction (NPD), and the cation composition of the samples was determined by NPD, inductance coupled plasma (ICP), and wet-chemistry analysis. The structure was characterized by powder x-ray diffraction and NPD. The dc magnetic susceptibility (\chi) was measured as a function of temperature using a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer, and the electrical resistivity (\rho) was measured using the standard four-lead technique. The TEP was measured with a resolution of \sim 0.1 \muV/K (Ref. [11]) in the temperature region of interest.

All samples investigated display a single phase of Hg 1:2:0:1 within the resolution of our x-ray diffraction (\pm5%) and neutron diffraction (\pm5%). The cation stoichiometry in the as-synthesized Hg 1:2:0:1 is Hg:Ba:Cu=0.98:2:1, as shown by NPD,[12] in contrast to the value \sim 0.7:2:1 as determined by the ICP technique and the wet-chemical method.[10] The microprobe method, which is commonly used to determine the cation ratios, failed because of sample surface degradation induced by polishing. The Hg content was the same after annealing at lower temperatures (\leq 300 degC) over short periods of time (\leq 10 h), but apparently decreased up to \sim 5% after prolonged heat treatment (> 100 h) at high temperatures (400 degC) based on our TGA and NPD data. This small Hg loss did not result in any significant irreversible change in T_{\rm c} (< 1 K) or superconducting volume fraction (\leq 5%) according to the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization results on powder samples and thus, is not expected to affect the discussion that follows. However, it does lead to an irreversible increase in \rho (up to \sim 15% for the most heavily overdoped sample with a T_{\rm c} \sim 20 K) due to the degradation of the grain boundaries. Therefore, exact \rho evolution with oxygenation is yet to be determined.

The \rho(T) and \chi(T) of the Hg 1:2:0:1 samples were carefully measured after various heat treatments. In general, the removal of oxygen results in a rapid \rho increase for the underdoped samples with \delta < \delta_{\rm op} but only a slow \rho increase for the overdoped ones with \delta > \delta_{\rm op}, where \delta_{\rm op} = 0.22 is the \delta at the optimal doping level. The superconducting signal (\Delta\chi) of all samples was found to be > 5% and > 20% of a perfect superconductor as determined in the field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) modes, respectively, demonstrating bulk superconductivity in all samples examined. However, it should be pointed out that \Delta\chi decreases with the decrease in T_{\rm c} in both the \delta < \delta_{\rm op} and \delta > \delta_{\rm op} regions. This could be attributed to the increase of the penetration depth. The superconducting transition of these samples was relatively narrow with a width < 5 K. The T_{\rm c} so obtained was found to depend on \delta parabolically as 97 K[1 - 26(\delta - \delta_{\rm op})^{2}] where \delta_{\rm op} = 0.22 over the entire doping range of 0.03 \leq\delta\leq 0.4 as displayed in Fig. 2.

The TEP(_T_)'s of samples with different \delta's were determined. A few examples are shown in Fig. 3, inset. In general, a \delta increase shifts the TEP(_T_) curve downward in parallel, rapidly for samples with \delta < \delta_{\rm op} but only slowly for those with \delta > \delta_{\rm op}, similar to that observed previously.[4] However, the TEP(_T_) reaches a minimum at \delta = 0.28, and further oxygenation shifts the whole TEP(_T_) curve upward instead. Following the universal correspondence of room-temperature TEP with p, proposed by Obertelli _et al._,[4] the p's of the samples with  different \delta's were determined. The bond-valence summation method was also used to determine p. The value of the as-synthesized samples obtained is \sim 0.17, which compares well with the value of 0.15 as determined by the thermoelectric power method. As shown in Fig. 3, T_{c} was found to vary with p parabolically as 97 K[1 - 50(_p_ - 0.16)2] as T_{c} rises from 1 K to the T_{c}^{\max} = 97 K in the underdoped region and then decreases to \sim 75 K in the overdoped region. This T_{c} region where the parabolic T_{c}-p relationship holds corresponds to a \delta range, varying from 0.03 to 0.28. A deviation from the parabolic T_{c}(p) dependence occurs for T_{c} < 75 K in the overdoped region, corresponding to \delta > 0.28.

The lattice parameters a and c were also determined for samples with different \delta's. c was found to decrease continuously with \delta increase for \delta < 0.28 but to change only very slightly with further increase of \delta, as shown in Fig. 4. The break in the c (\delta) curve coincides with the departure from the parabolic T_{c}(p) behavior at \delta \sim 0.28.

The T_{c} changes with \delta parabolically (Fig. 2) as observed previously in other cuprates HTS's.^{1-5} The T_{c}(p) = 97 K[1 - 50(_p_ - 0.16)2] observed for Hg 1:2:0:1 shown in Fig. 3 is in qualitative agreement with the parabolic universal relation T_{c}(p) = T_{c}^{\max}[1 - 82.6(_p_ - 0.16)2] where p is determined from the same TEP measurements at room temperatures.^{3-5} It is particularly true that T_{c}^{\max} of Hg 1:2:0:1 occurs at the same p = 0.16 as for all other cuprates HTS's. However, the prefactor of 50 observed here is smaller than the 82.6 for other HTS's. The extrapolated superconducting range of \Delta p = 0.28 for Hg 1:2:0:1 is therefore significantly greater than that of 0.22 for other HTS's.^{3,4} The difference observed here appears to exceed that arising from the uncertainty \pm0.015 of p for the cuprates examined in Ref. [4]. Our results may therefore suggest that the charge reservoir can affect T_{c} through roles other than the well-accepted one as a carrier supplier.^{13} The observed T_{c}(\delta) and T_{c}(p) gave p = 0.728\pm p_{0} with p_{0} = 0 \pm 0.01, implying that Hg 1:2:0:1 is not self-doped, as suggested by the band-structure calculation of Novikov and Freeman.^{14} This p-\delta relation disagrees with the ionic model, which predicts p = 28, giving two carriers per oxygen. This can be attributed to the strong covalent bonding between Hg and O(4) in the HgO_{3} layer recently proposed by Singh and Pickett.^{15} Details will be published elsewhere.^{16}

For \delta > 0.28, T_{c}(p) is no longer parabolic as shown in Fig. 3. The dramatic departure from the parabolic T_{c}(p) of Hg 1:2:0:1 appears for T_{c} < 75 K or \delta > 0.28 in the overdoped region. In spite of the continuous increase of \delta and the continuous decrease of T_{c} and \rho(T), p shows a small but distinct decrease in a contrast to expectation. This p decrease coincides with the reverse trend of TEP and c various in \delta \geq 0.28 (Figs. 3 and 4). The observed T_{c}(p) in Hg 1:2:0:1 for p > 0.22 is qualitatively similar to the T_{c}(n_{s}/m^{*}) in Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} reported by Niedermayer _et al.^{5}_ and Uemura _et al.^{7}_ in the overdoping region, which has been attributed to the strong depairing effect of the extra carriers,^{5} to the failure of scaling between normal state n and n_{s}, or to an increase in m^{*}.^{7} However, it should be noted that a parabolic T_{c}(p) was detected for Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} throughout the overdoped region. The departure of T_{c}(p) of Hg 1:2:0:1 with \delta > 0.28 from the parabolic T_{c}(p) behavior may therefore arise from a different cause. It has been observed that the lat

  tice parameter c contracts in all double Tl(Bi)-layer HTS's but expands in the single Tl-layer compounds, because of the different sites in the compound that oxygen centers.3 The nearly constant c with oxygenation d > 0.28 observed in Hg 1:2:0:1 (Fig. 4) is very different from the continuous decrease with d for d < 0.28. This may imply that there are two different types of sites for oxygen to enter Hg 1:2:0:1, one presumably in the HgO8 layers and the other off the HgO8 layers. The latter will be occupied when d is large. It follows that although excess O atoms in both sites suppress T_{c} and possibly the superconducting condensate n_{s} in the overdoped region, they contribute to the transport properties in the normal state differently, i.e., one enhances TEP(_T_) and the other suppresses TEP(_T_). It will not be surprising if oxygen in the different sites will also be discovered to have different effects on other superconducting properties, such as pinning. To test the above conjecture, several experiments on the sites of excess oxygen, the superconducting concentrates, and field effects on _kh_ of samples with different _d_'s are underway.

In conclusion, we have carried out a systematic study on the O-doping effect on Hg 1:2:0:1 over a wide anion-doping range. The T_{c} was found to vary parabolically with d throughout the doping range where T_{c} rises from 1 to 97 K and loops back to 20 K with a continuous d increase, which is in agreement with the previous reports. For d < 0.28, T_{c} was observed to vary also parabolically with p, but with a prefactor different from other cuprate HTS's, with p = 0.728, significantly less than the expected two carries per oxygen. This implies a possibly important role, other than that of carrier supplier to the CuO2 layers, of the charge reservoir in inducing superconductivity in layered cuprates. However, T_{c} departs from the parabolic T_{c}(_p_) relation known for other HTS's for d > 0.28, coinciding with the anomalous _c_(_d_) behavior detected. While the departure observed here in Hg 1:2:0:1 appears to be similar for T_{c}(_n__s_/_m_ *) reported recently in Tl2Ba2CuO6+_d_, our observation suggests that excess oxygen may have entered different sites when d > 0.28 and that oxygen in different sites may influence the properties of the compounds in their normal and superconducting states differently. The results also suggest that T_{c}(_p_) may depend on the specifics of the material system, particularly in the heavily overdoped region, and that no universal relation of the type previously suggested exists.
