###### Abstract

We report the results of our investigations on a polycrystalline sample of Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5}, which crystallizes in the U_{2}Co_{3}Si_{5}-type structure (Ibam). These investigations comprise powder x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and high-temperature (120-300 K) heat-capacity studies. Our results reveal that the sample undergoes a superconducting transition below 3.5 K. It also undergoes a first-order phase transition between 150-250 K as revealed by an upturn in the resistivity, a diamagnetic drop in the magnetic susceptibility, and a large anomaly (20-30 J/mol K) in the specific heat data. We observe a huge thermal hysteresis of almost 45 K between the cooling and warming data across this high-temperature transition in all our measurements. Low-temperature x-ray diffraction measurements at 87 K reveals that the compound undergoes a structural change at the high-temperature transition. Resistivity data taken in repeated cooling and warming cycles indicate that at the high-temperature transition, the system goes into a highly metastable state; successive heating and/or cooling curves are found to lie above the previous one, and the resistance keeps increasing with every thermal cycle. The room-temperature resistance of a thermally cycled piece of the sample decays exponentialy with time with a decay-time constant estimated to be about 10^{4} s. The anomaly (upturn) in the resistivity and the large drop (\sim40\%) in the susceptibility across the high-temperature transition suggest that the observed structural change is accompanied or induced by an electronic transition.

The Rietveld fit [16] to the powder x-ray data of Lu2Ir3Si5 is shown in Fig. 2 and the parameters obtained from this fit are given in Table 1. The values for the lattice constants estimated from the fit are a = 9.914 57(5) \AA, b = 11.286 65(5) \AA, and c = 5.721 91(5) \AA. An earlier report [12] has established that the compound Ce2Ir3Si5 crystallizes in the same structure.

A commercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (MPMS5, Quantum Design, USA) was used to measure the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility \chi in a field of 10 Oe for temperatures between 1.8 to 10 K to detect the superconducting transition and in a field of 0.1 T in the temperature range from 10 to 300 K. The resistivity was measured using a four-probe dc technique on a home-built setup with contacts made using silver paint on a bar-shaped sample 1 mm thick, 10 mm long, and 2 mm wide. The temperature was measured using a calibrated Si diode (Lake Shore Inc., USA) sensor. The sample voltage was measured with a nanovoltmeter (model 182, Keithley, USA) with a current of 5 mA using a 20 ppm stable (Hewlett Packard, USA) current source. All the data were collected using an IBM compatible PC/AT via IEEE-488 interface. For measuring resistance versus temperature for repeated cooling and warming cycles in the temperature range 1.8-300 K we used a commercial system (PPMS, Quantum Design). The heat capacity in zero field between 120 and 300 K was measured using a commercial DSC system.

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity \rho versus temperature from 1.8 to 300 K. The data were recorded while warming the sample from 1.8 to 300 K. The inset in the same panel shows the low-temperature behavior of \rho from 1.8 to 10 K. From the inset one can clearly see that the resistivity sharply drops below 3.3 K. The resistive drop, however, is not complete down to 1.8 K. Figure 3(b) shows the temperature dependence of the low-temperature FC (data was recorded when sample was cooled with field on) and ZFC (data were recorded while warming up in a field after the sample was cooled in zero field) susceptibility to highlight the existence of superconductivity in the sample. We can clearly see the abrupt diamagnetic signal below 3.3 K. However, the transition is again not complete. Diamagnetism in the FC curve shows the bulk nature of the superconductivity in this compound. The diamagnetic signal in the \chi measurement together with

Another sample from a different batch shows a drop to zero resistivity at 2.8 K, but the high-temperature phase transition was broader as compared to the currently studied sample. From Fig. 3(a) we can see that between 150 and 225 K the resistivity of the compound shows an upturn similar to the one usually observed in charge- or spin-density wave (CDW/SDW) transition due to the opening up of a gap in the electronic density of states associated with these transitions. After reaching a maximum at about 154 K, the resistivity continues to show a metallic behavior down to the lowest temperatures before undergoing the superconducting transition. It is interesting to recall that we had recently observed a similar but much weaker anomaly in the resistivity of the compound Er_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} below 150 K although there was no signature of the transition in the magnetic susceptibility for that sample. None of the other members of the series showed this anomaly.[13]

Figure 4(a) shows the resistivity for temperature scans while both cooling and warming the sample between 100 and 300 K at a rate of 2 K/min. On cooling down from 300 K (the lower curve) we encounter the onset (upturn in resistance) of the transition at \sim170 K. The resistance continues to rise until it reaches a maximum at \sim154 K after which it starts decreasing with decreasing temperature. We see that the transition is a rather broad one, \sim20 K wide. While warming the sample (the upper curve) we find that the onset/upturn occurs at \sim215 K. We have plotted d\rho/dT versus temperature in the inset of Fig. 4. The sharp peaks in the d\rho/dT plot give us a better estimate of the transition temperatures, which are 164 K while cooling from 300 K and 208 K while warming to 300 K. Thus, we can clearly see that there is a huge thermal hysteresis of almost 40-45 K between the up and down scans. This strongly suggests a first-order transition for the system. Another feature of interest in the resistivity plot shown in Fig. 4(a) is that after the transition, the warming curve lies above the cooling curve and does not come down to meet the cooling curve for temperatures beyond the transition. We have taken repeated cooling and warming measurements continuously for many cycles and find that the resistance always keeps increasing with each thermal cycle. We have shown this in Fig. 4(b) for two down- and two upscans taken one after the other in the sequence down-up-down-up. It is clearly seen that between cooling down and warming up to 300 K, the resistance value has increased in both cycles.

We have done measurements (not shown here) for seven cycles i.e., we start from 300 K and measure down to 5 K and then we measure while warming up to 300 K again; we call this sequence one cycle) and repeat this for upto six

Figure 4: (a) shows the resistivity (\rho) for temperature (T) scans while both cooling and warming Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} between 100 and 300 K. The inset of (a) shows the temperature dependence of d\rho/dT illustrating the hysteresis of the high-temperature phase transition. (b) depicts the effect of thermal cycling on the resistivity for two cycles. The arrows indicate the start of cycle 1 and end of cycle 2.

  cycles. For each cycle, we see that the data point at 300 K forms a sort of ladder, which keeps climbing up with each thermal cycle.

In order to understand the nature of this phase transition, we have carried out low-temperature powder x-ray diffraction at 87 K, which along with the data at 300 K is shown Fig. 5. It is evident from this figure that the sample undergoes a structural transition below the high-temperature phase transition. Preliminary analysis suggests that a doubling of the unit cell of Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} could account for this change. However, single-crystal study is required to establish this conjecture. We have carried out x-ray measurements on a thermally cycled piece of the sample to see whether some part of the low-temperature (high-resistance) phase remains when we return from low temperatures to 300 K, thus, causing the resistance to go up with every thermal cycle. However, that is not the case and the x ray matches the room-temperature x ray for the virgin (not subjected to any thermal cycling) sample. It is possible that there is a large volume change across the high-temperature transition, which causes micro-racks to appear inside the sample, and this, in turn, could cause the resistance to go up with every thermal cycle as we would be increasing the number of such cracks with each cycle. However, a four-probe measurement of the room-temperature resistance as a function of the distance between the voltage leads shows a linear behavior suggesting that no large cracks are appearing on thermal cycling. Interestingly we find that the resistance decays with time if left at 300 K after it has been cycled several times between 5 K and 300 K. In Fig. 6 we show the resistance as a function of time measured for 24 h when the sample is left at 300 K after being subjected to seven thermal cycles between 5 and 300 K. Also plotted in the same figure is a fit to an exponentially decaying function of the form \rho_{0}e^{-t/\tau}. The estimated time constant \tau comes out to be 3.4\times 10^{4} s. The decay of the resistance after being subjected to several thermal cycles also contradicts the notion of the resistance increasing due to the cracks developing in the samples as the cracks would not anneal with time causing the resistance to decay.

The huge thermal hysteresis in the cooling and warming scans is also seen in the susceptibility \chi versus temperature plot shown in Fig. 7(a). The lower panel of the same figure shows the d\chi/dT versus T plots to determine the transition temperatures more exactly. The peak in d\chi/dT occurs at 166 K for the cooling curve and at 209 K for the warming curve which shows that the hysteresis in the susceptibility is also \sim40-45 K. It is interesting to note that there is a large diamagnetic drop (nearly 45% reduction) in the susceptibility across the transition as we cool down from 300 K. Since the sample contains no magnetic atoms and the transition is not affected by magnetic field (both the resistivity and susceptibility transitions do not change with applied magnetic field as high as 8 Tesla), we estimate that the reduction in the Pauli susceptibility is \sim50% across the transition. This indicates that the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level could be changing considerably across this high-temperature transition suggesting that an electronic transition accompanying or induced by the structural transition cannot be ruled out.

Finally, the results of our differential scanning calorimetry measurements are shown in Fig. 8. Large peaks are seen in the data recorded while cooling and warming the sample. In the main panel of the figure, the peaks marked by arrows correspond to the anomalies, which were seen in the resistivity and susceptibility measurements as well. However, an additional peak was observed at 135 K in the heating curve. The possibility of a matching second peak for the cooling scan could not be explored because of experiment limitations. It must be noted that no second peak was observed in either the cooling or warming scans in the resistivity or susceptibility measurements. The DSC measurements were re

  peated three times and always revealed the same results. The entropy associated with the transition (the peaks marked by the arrows) has been estimated and is shown in the inset of the Fig. 8. The entropy involved here is substantial but it is not the same for cooling and heating, which is not understood at this juncture. It must be stressed here that it is not possible to separate the contribution of the structural phase transition from that arising from the electronic phase transition, which caused the large drop in the susceptibility. More investigations, preferably on single crystals of Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5}, are needed for complete understanding of this(these) phase transition(s). Also, heat capacity measurements down to lower temperatures are required to understand the multiple peaks observed in the heating scan.

It is now worthwhile to compare the properties observed for Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} with those of the known CDW system Lu_{8}Ir_{3}Si_{10}. The Lu_{8}Ir_{3}Si_{10} compound forms in the tetragonal Sc_{3}Co_{4}Si_{10} type structure (P4/mbm) while Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} forms in the orthorhombic U_{2}Co_{3}Si_{5} type structure (Ibam). Lu_{8}Ir_{4}Si_{10} undergoes a transition below 83 K, which has been shown to be a strongly coupled CDW-ordering transition.[14, 15] The signatures of this transition in the bulk properties are (i) a step-like upturn in the resistivity with \Delta\rho(T_{CDW})/\rho(300 K) = 23 % and \Delta T= 2 K. After the transition the resistivity still shows metallic behavior, indicating only partial gapping of the Fermi surface due to the CDW, (ii) a diamagnetic drop in the magnetic susceptibility with jump size \Delta\chi= 5 \times 10^{-5} emu/mol with \chi(300 K) = -6 \times 10^{-5}, and (iii) a huge spike of almost 100 J/mol (over the lattice contribution) in the heat-capacity measurement. There is no structural transformation down to low temperatures, and the compound becomes superconducting below 3.8 K. From the drop in the susceptibility and the heat capacity anomaly, a 36 % reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi Surface has been estimated.[17]

We have seen from our measurements on Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} that similar signatures are observed in the bulk properties for this compound. In particular, (i) an upturn in the resistivity at 165 K with \Delta\rho(T_{CDW})/\rho(300 K) \approx 35 % while cooling from 300 K and an upturn in the resistivity at 209 K with \Delta\rho(T_{CDW})/\rho(300 K) \approx 22 % while warming to 300 K and the width of the transition for both warming and cooling cycles is \approx 20 K. The resistivity remains metallic below this transition. (ii) There was a diamagnetic drop in the magnetic susceptibility with jump size \Delta\chi=3 \times 10^{-4} emu/mol with \chi(300 K)=-5 \times 10^{-4} for both cooling (165 K) and warming (208 K) cycles and (iii) large peaks (20 J/mol while cooling and 30 J/mol while warming) in the specific heat. The structure of Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} changes below this transition and finally at low temperatures the compound undergoes a superconducting transition (T_{C}\approx 3.5 K). The structural change accompanying the electronic transition complicates the analysis of the electronic transition. Extra peaks in the specific heat also indicate more than one transition. It is also worthwhile to note that the ionic size effect in the R_{5}Ir_{4}Si_{10} compounds leads to the CDW transition occurring at higher temperatures for compounds with a larger unit cell volume.[18] For the R_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} compounds, only Er_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} shows a similar resistive anomaly as the Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} compound.[13] However, it occurs at about 135 K and is much weaker. This indicates an ionic-size effect opposite to that shown in the R_{5}Ir_{4}Si_{10} compounds. Good quality samples of Tm_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} and possibly Yb_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} are required to be able to make a systematic ionic size effect analysis for the R_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} compounds.

## IV Conclusion

We have investigated the compound Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} using magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and room- and low

  temperature x-ray diffraction and differential-scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. We find that it crystallizes in a U_{2}Co_{3}Si_{5}-type structure at room temperature and undergoes a structural and possibly an electronic transition below 150 K. It also undergoes a superconducting transition below 3.3 K. It appears that Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} belongs to the growing group of CDW superconductors with three-dimensional structures, such as Lu_{3}Ir_{5}Si_{10}. However, unlike the latter, Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} exhibits a structural transition to another orthorhombic structure with a large unit cell. Studies on single crystals are essential to establish the nature of the high-temperature transition.

It is clearly seen that between cooling down and warming up to 300 K, the resistance value has increased in both cycles.

We have done measurements (not shown here) for seven cycles i.e., we start from 300 K and measure down to 5 K and then we measure while warming up to 300 K again; we call this sequence one cycle) and repeat this for upto six

  cycles. For each cycle, we see that the data point at 300 K forms a sort of ladder, which keeps climbing up with each thermal cycle.

In order to understand the nature of this phase transition, we have carried out low-temperature powder x-ray diffraction at 87 K, which along with the data at 300 K is shown Fig. 5. It is evident from this figure that the sample undergoes a structural transition below the high-temperature phase transition. Preliminary analysis suggests that a doubling of the unit cell of Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} could account for this change. However, single-crystal study is required to establish this conjecture. We have carried out x-ray measurements on a thermally cycled piece of the sample to see whether some part of the low-temperature (high-resistance) phase remains when we return from low temperatures to 300 K, thus, causing the resistance to go up with every thermal cycle. However, that is not the case and the x ray matches the room-temperature x ray for the virgin (not subjected to any thermal cycling) sample. It is possible that there is a large volume change across the high-temperature transition, which causes micro-racks to appear inside the sample, and this, in turn, could cause the resistance to go up with every thermal cycle as we would be increasing the number of such cracks with each cycle. However, a four-probe measurement of the room-temperature resistance as a function of the distance between the voltage leads shows a linear behavior suggesting that no large cracks are appearing on thermal cycling. Interestingly we find that the resistance decays with time if left at 300 K after it has been cycled several times between 5 K and 300 K. In Fig. 6 we show the resistance as a function of time measured for 24 h when the sample is left at 300 K after being subjected to seven thermal cycles between 5 and 300 K. Also plotted in the same figure is a fit to an exponentially decaying function of the form \rho_{0}e^{-t/\tau}. The estimated time constant \tau comes out to be 3.4\times 10^{4} s. The decay of the resistance after being subjected to several thermal cycles also contradicts the notion of the resistance increasing due to the cracks developing in the samples as the cracks would not anneal with time causing the resistance to decay.

The huge thermal hysteresis in the cooling and warming scans is also seen in the susceptibility \chi versus temperature plot shown in Fig. 7(a). The lower panel of the same figure shows the d\chi/dT versus T plots to determine the transition temperatures more exactly. The peak in d\chi/dT occurs at 166 K for the cooling curve and at 209 K for the warming curve which shows that the hysteresis in the susceptibility is also \sim40-45 K. It is interesting to note that there is a large diamagnetic drop (nearly 45% reduction) in the susceptibility across the transition as we cool down from 300 K. Since the sample contains no magnetic atoms and the transition is not affected by magnetic field (both the resistivity and susceptibility transitions do not change with applied magnetic field as high as 8 Tesla), we estimate that the reduction in the Pauli susceptibility is \sim50% across the transition. This indicates that the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level could be changing considerably across this high-temperature transition suggesting that an electronic transition accompanying or induced by the structural transition cannot be ruled out.

Finally, the results of our differential scanning calorimetry measurements are shown in Fig. 8. Large peaks are seen in the data recorded while cooling and warming the sample. In the main panel of the figure, the peaks marked by arrows correspond to the anomalies, which were seen in the resistivity and susceptibility measurements as well. However, an additional peak was observed at 135 K in the heating curve. The possibility of a matching second peak for the cooling scan could not be explored because of experiment limitations. It must be noted that no second peak was observed in either the cooling or warming scans in the resistivity or susceptibility measurements. The DSC measurements were re

  peated three times and always revealed the same results. The entropy associated with the transition (the peaks marked by the arrows) has been estimated and is shown in the inset of the Fig. 8. The entropy involved here is substantial but it is not the same for cooling and heating, which is not understood at this juncture. It must be stressed here that it is not possible to separate the contribution of the structural phase transition from that arising from the electronic phase transition, which caused the large drop in the susceptibility. More investigations, preferably on single crystals of Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5}, are needed for complete understanding of this(these) phase transition(s). Also, heat capacity measurements down to lower temperatures are required to understand the multiple peaks observed in the heating scan.

It is now worthwhile to compare the properties observed for Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} with those of the known CDW system Lu_{8}Ir_{3}Si_{10}. The Lu_{8}Ir_{3}Si_{10} compound forms in the tetragonal Sc_{3}Co_{4}Si_{10} type structure (P4/mbm) while Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} forms in the orthorhombic U_{2}Co_{3}Si_{5} type structure (Ibam). Lu_{8}Ir_{4}Si_{10} undergoes a transition below 83 K, which has been shown to be a strongly coupled CDW-ordering transition.[14, 15] The signatures of this transition in the bulk properties are (i) a step-like upturn in the resistivity with \Delta\rho(T_{CDW})/\rho(300 K) = 23 % and \Delta T= 2 K. After the transition the resistivity still shows metallic behavior, indicating only partial gapping of the Fermi surface due to the CDW, (ii) a diamagnetic drop in the magnetic susceptibility with jump size \Delta\chi= 5 \times 10^{-5} emu/mol with \chi(300 K) = -6 \times 10^{-5}, and (iii) a huge spike of almost 100 J/mol (over the lattice contribution) in the heat-capacity measurement. There is no structural transformation down to low temperatures, and the compound becomes superconducting below 3.8 K. From the drop in the susceptibility and the heat capacity anomaly, a 36 % reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi Surface has been estimated.[17]

We have seen from our measurements on Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} that similar signatures are observed in the bulk properties for this compound. In particular, (i) an upturn in the resistivity at 165 K with \Delta\rho(T_{CDW})/\rho(300 K) \approx 35 % while cooling from 300 K and an upturn in the resistivity at 209 K with \Delta\rho(T_{CDW})/\rho(300 K) \approx 22 % while warming to 300 K and the width of the transition for both warming and cooling cycles is \approx 20 K. The resistivity remains metallic below this transition. (ii) There was a diamagnetic drop in the magnetic susceptibility with jump size \Delta\chi=3 \times 10^{-4} emu/mol with \chi(300 K)=-5 \times 10^{-4} for both cooling (165 K) and warming (208 K) cycles and (iii) large peaks (20 J/mol while cooling and 30 J/mol while warming) in the specific heat. The structure of Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} changes below this transition and finally at low temperatures the compound undergoes a superconducting transition (T_{C}\approx 3.5 K). The structural change accompanying the electronic transition complicates the analysis of the electronic transition. Extra peaks in the specific heat also indicate more than one transition. It is also worthwhile to note that the ionic size effect in the R_{5}Ir_{4}Si_{10} compounds leads to the CDW transition occurring at higher temperatures for compounds with a larger unit cell volume.[18] For the R_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} compounds, only Er_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} shows a similar resistive anomaly as the Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} compound.[13] However, it occurs at about 135 K and is much weaker. This indicates an ionic-size effect opposite to that shown in the R_{5}Ir_{4}Si_{10} compounds. Good quality samples of Tm_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} and possibly Yb_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} are required to be able to make a systematic ionic size effect analysis for the R_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} compounds.

## IV Conclusion

  temperature x-ray diffraction and differential-scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. We find that it crystallizes in a U_{2}Co_{3}Si_{5}-type structure at room temperature and undergoes a structural and possibly an electronic transition below 150 K. It also undergoes a superconducting transition below 3.3 K. It appears that Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} belongs to the growing group of CDW superconductors with three-dimensional structures, such as Lu_{3}Ir_{5}Si_{10}. However, unlike the latter, Lu_{2}Ir_{3}Si_{5} exhibits a structural transition to another orthorhombic structure with a large unit cell. Studies on single crystals are essential to establish the nature of the high-temperature transition.
