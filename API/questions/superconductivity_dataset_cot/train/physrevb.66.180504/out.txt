###### Abstract

We report resistivity and the Hall-effect measurements in the normal and superconducting states of MgB_{2} single crystals. The resistivity has been found to be anisotropic with slightly temperature-dependent resistivity ratio of about 3.5. The Hall constant, with a magnetic field parallel to the Mg and B sheets, is negative in contrast to the holelike Hall response with a field directed along the c axis, indicating presence of both types of charge carriers and, thus, the multiband electronic structure of MgB_{2}. The Hall effect in the mixed state shows no sign change anomaly, reproducing Hall-effect behavior in clean limit type-II superconductors.

Following the recent discovery of superconductivity at about 39 K in magnesium diboride [1] various properties of this compound have been extensively studied. Early observation of the boron isotope effect [2] clearly indicated the important role of the electron-phonon interaction in MgB_{2}. Subsequent measurements of specific heat, [3]^{11}B NMR, [4] and Raman scattering [5] provided evidence for s-wave order-parameter symmetry. However, more recent studies of quasiparticle tunneling, [6, 7] specific heat, [8, 9, 10] and penetration depth [11] revealed unusual features indicating a double-energy superconducting gap. Theoretical studies also give support for this scenario. In particular, the existence of two superconducting gaps in MgB_{2} with a smaller one on the three-dimensional (3D) tubular network and a larger one on the 2D sheets was predicted by Liu, Mazin, and Kortus from first-principles calculations. [12]

In spite of the quite complex electronic band structure of MgB_{2}, results of theoretical calculations [12, 13, 14, 15] and direct studies of the Fermi surface in angle-resolved photoemission [16] and de Haas-van Alphen [17] experiments are in good agreement. To further understand the electronic structure of MgB_{2} it is crucially important to know the nature of the charge carriers in this compound. Hall-effect measurements are a powerful tool to obtain such information. Recently the Hall effect in MgB_{2} has been studied using hot-pressed polycrystalline [18] and thin-film [19, 20] samples. All these experiments gave a positive (holelike) sign of the Hall effect and about a one-order-of-magnitude lower value of the normal-state Hall constant, compared to low-T_{c} superconductors, such as Nb_{3}Sn and Nb_{3}Ge. However, the other features of the reported Hall effect of MgB_{2} are rather contradictory. In particular, the T dependence of the Hall constant differed among the reported data. [18, 19, 20] Also, in the measurements below T_{c} Jin _et al._[19] observed a sign change of the Hall constant before it reaches zero, while Kang _et al._ found no sign reversal in their study of the Hall effect in the mixed state. [20]

The anisotropy of the upper critical field of MgB_{2} is well established now. [21, 22, 23] The availability of MgB_{2} single crystals [22] opens a unique opportunity to study the anisotropy of the electrical transport properties of this compound. Here we report measurements of the in-plane \rho_{xx}= \rho_{ab} and out-of-plane \rho_{zz}= \rho_{c} resistivity of MgB_{2} single crystals as well as the Hall effect with the magnetic field applied parallel to the c axis and along the ab planes in both the normal and superconducting states.

MgB_{2} single crystals were grown as described previously. [22] Several platelike crystals of dimensions \sim 0.5 x 0.1 x 0.03 nm^{3} were selected for the in-plane transport measurements, while in experiments with the current parallel to the c axis we used thicker crystals \sim 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 mm^{3} in size. All the crystals had T_{c}, defined as the resistivity onset, of about 38.8 K with \Delta T_{c}< 0.3 K. Stable, low-resistance (\sim1-2 \Omega) electrical contacts were made using gold or silver paste. For the measurements of the anisotropic resistivity, the contact configuration with two contacts on both ab planes of a crystal (sample 1) was used, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1, and \rho_{ab} and \rho_{c} were obtained from the Montgomery-type (MT) analysis. In our Hall-effect experiments the Hall resistivity \rho_{ij} was extracted from the antisymmetric part of the transverse voltage response under magnetic-field reversal, and the Hall constant R_{ij}^{H} was calcu

For comparison, \rho_{ab}(T) dependence obtained from the measurements with homogeneous in-plane current on sample 2 is also shown.

 lated as R_{ij}^{H}=\rho_{ij}/H. The in-plane Hall-effect measurements (sample 2) were performed with a homogeneous current parallel to the _ab_ planes and magnetic fields directed along the c axis. In the Hall-effect study with H parallel to _ab_ planes, both the out-of-plane Hall resistivity components \rho_{xz} and \rho_{xz} were obtained from the measurements with homogeneous current parallel to the _ab_ planes (sample 3) and c axis (sample 4), respectively. The experiments were carried out in a Quantum Design physical property measurement system in magnetic fields up to 9 T with the sample mounted on a horizontal rotator. Current-voltage response was recorded using the usual low-frequency (17 Hz) ac technique with an excitation current of 0.5-1 mA within a linear regime.

The anisotropic behavior of the resistivity of the MgB_{2} single crystal is illustrated in Fig. 1. The inset of Fig. 1 presents raw data obtained from the two sets of measurements with current injected along the _ab_ planes (I_{12}) and parallel to the c axis (I_{13}). Due to the combined effect of the contact configuration, crystal geometry and resistivity anisotropy values of R_{1}=V_{34}/I_{12} and R_{2}=V_{24}/I_{13} are rather different, with a slightly _T_-dependent ratio R_{1}/R_{2}=\,6. To extract values of the \rho_{ab} and \rho_{c} , we used the MT analysis.[24; 25] Since the electrical terminals cover a significant portion of the sample surface, the finite contact size was taken into account. In our calculations we assumed uniform current injection within the contacts area. We also supposed that the voltage contacts did not disturb the current distribution within the sample and thus probed the averaged value of the potential at the interface between the sample and voltage terminal. Both assumptions were safely justified by the high conductivity of the crystal compared to the contact resistance.

Obtained from our analysis, results for \rho_{ab}(T) and \rho_{c}(T) are shown in the main panel of Fig. 1. Close agreement between resistivity data for samples 1 and 2 (calculated from the MT analysis and directly measured with homogeneous in-plane current distribution, respectively) gives proof of the validity of our analysis.[26] From Fig. 1 one can see the pronounced resistivity anisotropy of the MgB_{2} single crystal. Just above T_{c} we obtain a resistivity ratio \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}=\,3.6 \pm 1.0. The rather small and monotonic decrease of this ratio with temperature, down to \sim3.4 at _T_=273 K, suggests a similar temperature dependence for \rho_{ab} and \rho_{c} , and thus the same scattering mechanism for the in- as well as the out-of-plane charge transport. Actually, both \rho_{ab}(T) and \rho_{c}(T) for MgB_{2} may be fairly well described by a Bloch-Gruneisen (BG) expression for resistivity,[19]

\[\rho\,\text{=}\,\rho_{0}\text{+}\,\text{+}\,\text{+}\,\text{(4\,\pi)}^{2}\text {(2\,}T/\Theta_{D})^{5}\int_{0}^{\Theta_{D}\text{/}2T}\text{x}^{5}\text{/sinh}^{2}\text{(x)}dx,\] (1)

where \Theta_{D} is the Debye temperature, \rho_{0} is the residual resistivity, and C is a proportionality constant. The dotted lines in Fig. 1 represent BG behavior as obtained from Eq. (1) with the same \Theta_{D}=880 K,[27] and different values \rho_{0} of 0.69 and 2.62 \mul\,cm, and constant C of 0.25 and 0.86 \mul\,cm for \rho_{ab} and \rho_{c} , respectively. Thus, in agreement with theoretical calculations of the electronic structure and electron-phonon (EP) interaction in magnesium diboride[12; 13; 14] the present result demonstrates the importance of the EP scattering for both the in- and the out-of-plane resistivities.

A striking anisotropy is observed in the normal-state Hall effect. Shown in Fig. 2 are the in- and the out-of-plane Hall constants vs T, obtained from the linear dependence of the Hall response on magnetic fields up to 9 T at various temperatures. As in the previous studies,[18; 19; 20] the in-plane Hall constant has been found to be positive, while the out-of-plane Hall response with H parallel to the _ab_ planes shows _n_-type charge carriers. To understand this two-carrier behavior in more detail, let us first consider the Hall effect in a two parabolic band model with both electrons and holes as charge carriers. In this case the Hall constant is a sum of the contributions from each band,

\[R^{H}\text{=}\,(p\,\mu_{p}^{2}\text{-}\,n\,\mu_{n}^{2})\text{/}\,e\,c\,(p\, \mu_{p}\text{+}\,n\,\mu_{n})^{2},\] (2)

where e is the carrier charge, c is light velocity, n and p are the densities of electrons and holes, respectively, and n_{\mu} and \mu_{p} are the corresponding mobilities.[28] From Eq. (2), the positive or negative sign of the Hall constant comes from a balance of the hole and electronic terms. Thus, opposite signs of the Hall response in two magnetic-field orientations may be obtained if one suggests strongly anisotropic mobility for at least one type of carrier. The _T_-dependent behavior of both Hall constants is also expected within a two-band

Figure 2: The in- and the out-of-plane Hall constants, as a function of temperature in the normal state of MgB_{2} single crystals (top and bottom panels, respectively). The out-of-plane Hall response was measured on two crystals with current parallel to the _ab_ planes (sample 3) and I parallel to the c axis (sample 4). In accordance with the Onsager relation, the data for both samples demonstrate close agreement within experimental error. Inset: Temperature dependence of cot \theta_{H} at 5 T.

  model, taking into account a possibility of different T dependencies of the hole and electron mobilities in Eq. (2). Actually, the situation for MgB_{2} is more complicated compared to a simple two parabolic band model since the Fermi surface of this compound consists of two quasi-two-dimensional hole sheets (\sigma bands) and two three-dimensional light hole and electron honeycombs (\pi bands).[12, 13, 14, 15] In this particular case a nearly isotropic mobility for both types of carriers from \pi bands as well as a strongly anisotropic mass and, thus, an anisotropic mobility for \sigma-band holes is expected. In fact, the results of computing the independent components of the Hall tensor for MgB_{2} within a rigid-band scheme[15] show that anisotropic contribution of the hole \sigma states dominates in the positive in-plane Hall response, while the prevailing contribution of the electronic \pi band results in the n type of Hall effect with H parallel to the ab planes. Thus, our observation of two-carrier behavior is qualitatively supported by the band theory considering MgB_{2} as a multiband metal. Assuming no contribution from the electrons and holes to the in- and out-of-plane transport, respectively, we can also estimate from Eq. (2) the upper limit of electron and hole densities as n\sim 3.4\times 10^{22} cm^{-3} and p\sim 2.6\times 10^{22} cm^{-3} at T= 40 K. Obtained values are about one-order-of-magnitude lower than the previously reported carrier density for bulk and thin-film MgB_{2} samples.[18, 19, 20] This difference does not look surprising, since the apparent Hall coefficient derived from the measurements on polycrystalline samples with randomly oriented grains could represent a sum of the in- and out-of-plane Hall responses of opposite polarities, thus, resulting in overestimated carrier density.

We would also like to point out that the different signs of the in- and out-of-plane Hall constants in MgB_{2} resemble the Hall effect in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} with p- and n-type Hall responses obtained in studies with H parallel to the c axis and ab planes, respectively.[29, 30] However, this similarity does not extend to the T dependence of the Hall effect in MgB_{2} and the high-T_{c} superconductors (HTS). In particular, studies of the Hall effect in various HTS revealed an anomalously strong T dependence of the in-plane Hall constant, which just above T_{c} can be turned into a simple T^{2} dependence of the cotangent of the Hall angle, cot \theta_{H}= \rho_{xx}/\rho_{xy} (for a review, see Ref. [31]). According to Anderson,[32] this unusual behavior of the Hall effect in HTS was interpreted as a result of the existence of two distinct relaxation time scales. On the contrary, for MgB_{2}, cot \theta_{H}(T) does not show a T^{2} dependence in a broad temperature range as obtained from our resistivity and Hall-effect measurements (see inset in the upper panel of Fig. 2).[33] Furthermore, the T dependence of the Hall constant in MgB_{2} and HTS seems to be of completely different origins. As mentioned above, in a multiband metal, such as MgB_{2}, the T dependence of the Hall constant may come from the different T dependencies of the hole and electron mobilities. Such a possibility was recently suggested in a model of electric transport in MgB_{2} based on the assumption of a large difference in the scattering rate of the \sigma and \pi bands and extremely small \sigma\pi scattering.[34]

Finally, we present results of the Hall-effect measurements in the mixed state of a MgB_{2} single crystal. Shown in Fig. 3 are T dependencies of the in- and out-of-plane longitudinal and Hall resistivities. As reported previously[23]\rho_{xx} exhibits a remarkable broadening of the superconducting transition in a magnetic field. Measured simultaneously, \rho_{xy} was found to be positive in the entire transition region, and with decreasing temperature monotonically decreased to zero. Data for the out-of-plane Hall effect display a very similar behavior, except for the negative sign of the out-of-plane Hall constant, a smaller transition width, and a higher transition temperature in a magnetic field of the same magnitude. In striking contrast to the Hall voltage sign reversal previously reported for MgB_{2} films[19] our results for both the in- and out-of-plane Hall effects do not show sign change. However, as we already mentioned, the anomalous Hall-effect behavior in polycrystalline MgB_{2} samples may have an extrinsic origin reflecting a possible mixture of the in- and out-of-plane Hall responses of opposite polarities.

In conventional superconductors the Hall-effect sign change anomaly near T_{c} was reported for moderately clean superconductors with a ratio l/\xi_{0}= 0.5\div 5, where l is the electron mean free path, and \xi_{0} is the coherence length, while a sign reversal does not occur in either the clean (l\gg\xi_{0}) or dirty (l\ll\xi_{0}) limits (see Ref. [35], and references therein). For MgB_{2}, the in- and out-of-plane coherence lengths were found to be \sim68 and \sim23 A, respectively.[23] Using data for anisotropic resistivity and carrier density obtained from our normal-state measurements, and the Fermi velocity of 4.9\times10^{7} cm/s parallel to the ab planes and of 4.76\times10^{7} cm/s along the c axis,[13] we estimate the corresponding l to be \sim700 and \sim180 A just above T_{c} , and, thus, l/\xi_{0}\sim 10 for both directions. From this analysis we can con

Lower panel: The in- and out-of-plane Hall resistivities at the same fields.

  clude that the absence of the Hall-effect sign change in MgB_{2} is in good agreement with the empirical correlation between microscopic material parameters and the mixed-state Hall-effect behavior reported for type-II superconductors.[35]

In summary, the in- and out-of-plane electrical transport properties of MgB_{2} single crystals have been studied. We found substantial resistivity anisotropy with a resistivity ratio \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\approx3.5. Both \rho_{ab} and \rho_{c} display similar T dependencies described by a BG expression as a first approximation, thus indicating a predominant contribution of the EP interaction to the in- as well as out-of-plane charge transport in MgB_{2}.

###### Abstract

We report resistivity and the Hall-effect measurements in the normal and superconducting states of MgB_{2} single crystals. The resistivity has been found to be anisotropic with slightly temperature-dependent resistivity ratio of about 3.5. The Hall constant, with a magnetic field parallel to the Mg and B sheets, is negative in contrast to the holelike Hall response with a field directed along the c axis, indicating presence of both types of charge carriers and, thus, the multiband electronic structure of MgB_{2}. The Hall effect in the mixed state shows no sign change anomaly, reproducing Hall-effect behavior in clean limit type-II superconductors.

Following the recent discovery of superconductivity at about 39 K in magnesium diboride [1] various properties of this compound have been extensively studied. Early observation of the boron isotope effect [2] clearly indicated the important role of the electron-phonon interaction in MgB_{2}. Subsequent measurements of specific heat, [3]^{11}B NMR, [4] and Raman scattering [5] provided evidence for s-wave order-parameter symmetry. However, more recent studies of quasiparticle tunneling, [6, 7] specific heat, [8, 9, 10] and penetration depth [11] revealed unusual features indicating a double-energy superconducting gap. Theoretical studies also give support for this scenario. In particular, the existence of two superconducting gaps in MgB_{2} with a smaller one on the three-dimensional (3D) tubular network and a larger one on the 2D sheets was predicted by Liu, Mazin, and Kortus from first-principles calculations. [12]

In spite of the quite complex electronic band structure of MgB_{2}, results of theoretical calculations [12, 13, 14, 15] and direct studies of the Fermi surface in angle-resolved photoemission [16] and de Haas-van Alphen [17] experiments are in good agreement. To further understand the electronic structure of MgB_{2} it is crucially important to know the nature of the charge carriers in this compound. Hall-effect measurements are a powerful tool to obtain such information. Recently the Hall effect in MgB_{2} has been studied using hot-pressed polycrystalline [18] and thin-film [19, 20] samples. All these experiments gave a positive (holelike) sign of the Hall effect and about a one-order-of-magnitude lower value of the normal-state Hall constant, compared to low-T_{c} superconductors, such as Nb_{3}Sn and Nb_{3}Ge. However, the other features of the reported Hall effect of MgB_{2} are rather contradictory. In particular, the T dependence of the Hall constant differed among the reported data. [18, 19, 20] Also, in the measurements below T_{c} Jin _et al._[19] observed a sign change of the Hall constant before it reaches zero, while Kang _et al._ found no sign reversal in their study of the Hall effect in the mixed state. [20]

The anisotropy of the upper critical field of MgB_{2} is well established now. [21, 22, 23] The availability of MgB_{2} single crystals [22] opens a unique opportunity to study the anisotropy of the electrical transport properties of this compound. Here we report measurements of the in-plane \rho_{xx}= \rho_{ab} and out-of-plane \rho_{zz}= \rho_{c} resistivity of MgB_{2} single crystals as well as the Hall effect with the magnetic field applied parallel to the c axis and along the ab planes in both the normal and superconducting states.

MgB_{2} single crystals were grown as described previously. [22] Several platelike crystals of dimensions \sim 0.5 x 0.1 x 0.03 nm^{3} were selected for the in-plane transport measurements, while in experiments with the current parallel to the c axis we used thicker crystals \sim 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 mm^{3} in size. All the crystals had T_{c}, defined as the resistivity onset, of about 38.8 K with \Delta T_{c}< 0.3 K. Stable, low-resistance (\sim1-2 \Omega) electrical contacts were made using gold or silver paste. For the measurements of the anisotropic resistivity, the contact configuration with two contacts on both ab planes of a crystal (sample 1) was used, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1, and \rho_{ab} and \rho_{c} were obtained from the Montgomery-type (MT) analysis. In our Hall-effect experiments the Hall resistivity \rho_{ij} was extracted from the antisymmetric part of the transverse voltage response under magnetic-field reversal, and the Hall constant R_{ij}^{H} was calcu

 lated as R_{ij}^{H}=\rho_{ij}/H. The in-plane Hall-effect measurements (sample 2) were performed with a homogeneous current parallel to the _ab_ planes and magnetic fields directed along the c axis. In the Hall-effect study with H parallel to _ab_ planes, both the out-of-plane Hall resistivity components \rho_{xz} and \rho_{xz} were obtained from the measurements with homogeneous current parallel to the _ab_ planes (sample 3) and c axis (sample 4), respectively. The experiments were carried out in a Quantum Design physical property measurement system in magnetic fields up to 9 T with the sample mounted on a horizontal rotator. Current-voltage response was recorded using the usual low-frequency (17 Hz) ac technique with an excitation current of 0.5-1 mA within a linear regime.

The anisotropic behavior of the resistivity of the MgB_{2} single crystal is illustrated in Fig. 1. The inset of Fig. 1 presents raw data obtained from the two sets of measurements with current injected along the _ab_ planes (I_{12}) and parallel to the c axis (I_{13}). Due to the combined effect of the contact configuration, crystal geometry and resistivity anisotropy values of R_{1}=V_{34}/I_{12} and R_{2}=V_{24}/I_{13} are rather different, with a slightly _T_-dependent ratio R_{1}/R_{2}=\,6. To extract values of the \rho_{ab} and \rho_{c} , we used the MT analysis.[24; 25] Since the electrical terminals cover a significant portion of the sample surface, the finite contact size was taken into account. In our calculations we assumed uniform current injection within the contacts area. We also supposed that the voltage contacts did not disturb the current distribution within the sample and thus probed the averaged value of the potential at the interface between the sample and voltage terminal. Both assumptions were safely justified by the high conductivity of the crystal compared to the contact resistance.

Obtained from our analysis, results for \rho_{ab}(T) and \rho_{c}(T) are shown in the main panel of Fig. 1. Close agreement between resistivity data for samples 1 and 2 (calculated from the MT analysis and directly measured with homogeneous in-plane current distribution, respectively) gives proof of the validity of our analysis.[26] From Fig. 1 one can see the pronounced resistivity anisotropy of the MgB_{2} single crystal. Just above T_{c} we obtain a resistivity ratio \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}=\,3.6 \pm 1.0. The rather small and monotonic decrease of this ratio with temperature, down to \sim3.4 at _T_=273 K, suggests a similar temperature dependence for \rho_{ab} and \rho_{c} , and thus the same scattering mechanism for the in- as well as the out-of-plane charge transport. Actually, both \rho_{ab}(T) and \rho_{c}(T) for MgB_{2} may be fairly well described by a Bloch-Gruneisen (BG) expression for resistivity,[19]

\[\rho\,\text{=}\,\rho_{0}\text{+}\,\text{+}\,\text{+}\,\text{(4\,\pi)}^{2}\text {(2\,}T/\Theta_{D})^{5}\int_{0}^{\Theta_{D}\text{/}2T}\text{x}^{5}\text{/sinh}^{2}\text{(x)}dx,\] (1)

where \Theta_{D} is the Debye temperature, \rho_{0} is the residual resistivity, and C is a proportionality constant. The dotted lines in Fig. 1 represent BG behavior as obtained from Eq. (1) with the same \Theta_{D}=880 K,[27] and different values \rho_{0} of 0.69 and 2.62 \mul\,cm, and constant C of 0.25 and 0.86 \mul\,cm for \rho_{ab} and \rho_{c} , respectively. Thus, in agreement with theoretical calculations of the electronic structure and electron-phonon (EP) interaction in magnesium diboride[12; 13; 14] the present result demonstrates the importance of the EP scattering for both the in- and the out-of-plane resistivities.

A striking anisotropy is observed in the normal-state Hall effect. Shown in Fig. 2 are the in- and the out-of-plane Hall constants vs T, obtained from the linear dependence of the Hall response on magnetic fields up to 9 T at various temperatures. As in the previous studies,[18; 19; 20] the in-plane Hall constant has been found to be positive, while the out-of-plane Hall response with H parallel to the _ab_ planes shows _n_-type charge carriers. To understand this two-carrier behavior in more detail, let us first consider the Hall effect in a two parabolic band model with both electrons and holes as charge carriers. In this case the Hall constant is a sum of the contributions from each band,

\[R^{H}\text{=}\,(p\,\mu_{p}^{2}\text{-}\,n\,\mu_{n}^{2})\text{/}\,e\,c\,(p\, \mu_{p}\text{+}\,n\,\mu_{n})^{2},\] (2)

where e is the carrier charge, c is light velocity, n and p are the densities of electrons and holes, respectively, and n_{\mu} and \mu_{p} are the corresponding mobilities.[28] From Eq. (2), the positive or negative sign of the Hall constant comes from a balance of the hole and electronic terms. Thus, opposite signs of the Hall response in two magnetic-field orientations may be obtained if one suggests strongly anisotropic mobility for at least one type of carrier. The _T_-dependent behavior of both Hall constants is also expected within a two-band

Figure 2: The in- and the out-of-plane Hall constants, as a function of temperature in the normal state of MgB_{2} single crystals (top and bottom panels, respectively). The out-of-plane Hall response was measured on two crystals with current parallel to the _ab_ planes (sample 3) and I parallel to the c axis (sample 4). In accordance with the Onsager relation, the data for both samples demonstrate close agreement within experimental error. Inset: Temperature dependence of cot \theta_{H} at 5 T.

  model, taking into account a possibility of different T dependencies of the hole and electron mobilities in Eq. (2). Actually, the situation for MgB_{2} is more complicated compared to a simple two parabolic band model since the Fermi surface of this compound consists of two quasi-two-dimensional hole sheets (\sigma bands) and two three-dimensional light hole and electron honeycombs (\pi bands).[12, 13, 14, 15] In this particular case a nearly isotropic mobility for both types of carriers from \pi bands as well as a strongly anisotropic mass and, thus, an anisotropic mobility for \sigma-band holes is expected. In fact, the results of computing the independent components of the Hall tensor for MgB_{2} within a rigid-band scheme[15] show that anisotropic contribution of the hole \sigma states dominates in the positive in-plane Hall response, while the prevailing contribution of the electronic \pi band results in the n type of Hall effect with H parallel to the ab planes. Thus, our observation of two-carrier behavior is qualitatively supported by the band theory considering MgB_{2} as a multiband metal. Assuming no contribution from the electrons and holes to the in- and out-of-plane transport, respectively, we can also estimate from Eq. (2) the upper limit of electron and hole densities as n\sim 3.4\times 10^{22} cm^{-3} and p\sim 2.6\times 10^{22} cm^{-3} at T= 40 K. Obtained values are about one-order-of-magnitude lower than the previously reported carrier density for bulk and thin-film MgB_{2} samples.[18, 19, 20] This difference does not look surprising, since the apparent Hall coefficient derived from the measurements on polycrystalline samples with randomly oriented grains could represent a sum of the in- and out-of-plane Hall responses of opposite polarities, thus, resulting in overestimated carrier density.

We would also like to point out that the different signs of the in- and out-of-plane Hall constants in MgB_{2} resemble the Hall effect in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} with p- and n-type Hall responses obtained in studies with H parallel to the c axis and ab planes, respectively.[29, 30] However, this similarity does not extend to the T dependence of the Hall effect in MgB_{2} and the high-T_{c} superconductors (HTS). In particular, studies of the Hall effect in various HTS revealed an anomalously strong T dependence of the in-plane Hall constant, which just above T_{c} can be turned into a simple T^{2} dependence of the cotangent of the Hall angle, cot \theta_{H}= \rho_{xx}/\rho_{xy} (for a review, see Ref. [31]). According to Anderson,[32] this unusual behavior of the Hall effect in HTS was interpreted as a result of the existence of two distinct relaxation time scales. On the contrary, for MgB_{2}, cot \theta_{H}(T) does not show a T^{2} dependence in a broad temperature range as obtained from our resistivity and Hall-effect measurements (see inset in the upper panel of Fig. 2).[33] Furthermore, the T dependence of the Hall constant in MgB_{2} and HTS seems to be of completely different origins. As mentioned above, in a multiband metal, such as MgB_{2}, the T dependence of the Hall constant may come from the different T dependencies of the hole and electron mobilities. Such a possibility was recently suggested in a model of electric transport in MgB_{2} based on the assumption of a large difference in the scattering rate of the \sigma and \pi bands and extremely small \sigma\pi scattering.[34]

Finally, we present results of the Hall-effect measurements in the mixed state of a MgB_{2} single crystal. Shown in Fig. 3 are T dependencies of the in- and out-of-plane longitudinal and Hall resistivities. As reported previously[23]\rho_{xx} exhibits a remarkable broadening of the superconducting transition in a magnetic field. Measured simultaneously, \rho_{xy} was found to be positive in the entire transition region, and with decreasing temperature monotonically decreased to zero. Data for the out-of-plane Hall effect display a very similar behavior, except for the negative sign of the out-of-plane Hall constant, a smaller transition width, and a higher transition temperature in a magnetic field of the same magnitude. In striking contrast to the Hall voltage sign reversal previously reported for MgB_{2} films[19] our results for both the in- and out-of-plane Hall effects do not show sign change. However, as we already mentioned, the anomalous Hall-effect behavior in polycrystalline MgB_{2} samples may have an extrinsic origin reflecting a possible mixture of the in- and out-of-plane Hall responses of opposite polarities.

In conventional superconductors the Hall-effect sign change anomaly near T_{c} was reported for moderately clean superconductors with a ratio l/\xi_{0}= 0.5\div 5, where l is the electron mean free path, and \xi_{0} is the coherence length, while a sign reversal does not occur in either the clean (l\gg\xi_{0}) or dirty (l\ll\xi_{0}) limits (see Ref. [35], and references therein). For MgB_{2}, the in- and out-of-plane coherence lengths were found to be \sim68 and \sim23 A, respectively.[23] Using data for anisotropic resistivity and carrier density obtained from our normal-state measurements, and the Fermi velocity of 4.9\times10^{7} cm/s parallel to the ab planes and of 4.76\times10^{7} cm/s along the c axis,[13] we estimate the corresponding l to be \sim700 and \sim180 A just above T_{c} , and, thus, l/\xi_{0}\sim 10 for both directions. From this analysis we can con

Lower panel: The in- and out-of-plane Hall resistivities at the same fields.

  clude that the absence of the Hall-effect sign change in MgB_{2} is in good agreement with the empirical correlation between microscopic material parameters and the mixed-state Hall-effect behavior reported for type-II superconductors.[35]

In summary, the in- and out-of-plane electrical transport properties of MgB_{2} single crystals have been studied. We found substantial resistivity anisotropy with a resistivity ratio \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\approx3.5. Both \rho_{ab} and \rho_{c} display similar T dependencies described by a BG expression as a first approximation, thus indicating a predominant contribution of the EP interaction to the in- as well as out-of-plane charge transport in MgB_{2}.
