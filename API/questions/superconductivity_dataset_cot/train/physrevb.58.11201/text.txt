###### Abstract

The transition temperature (\(T_{c}\)) of the high-temperature superconductor YSr2Cu3O7.5 under hydrostatic pressures up to 1.7 GPa has been measured. The \(T_{c}\) was observed to increase from 62.6 to 67.8 K. Such a large positive \(dT_{c}/dP\) of \(\sim\)3 K/GPa is in strong contrast to that expected from the heavily doped nature of the sample, as suggested by the thermogravimetric and thermopower measurements.

## I Introduction

The physical properties of cuprate high-temperature superconductors (HTSr's) have been shown to depend critically on their carrier concentration (\(p\)), induced by cation and/or anion doping.1 A compound is known as optically doped when \(p\!=\!p_{o}\) where its \(T_{c}\) is maximum, underdoped when \(p\!<\!p_{o}\), or overdoped when \(p\!>\!p_{o}\). The underdoped HTSr's are suggested to be a "strange" metal that defies description of the Fermi-liquid picture, and the overdoped ones to be a "normal" metal.2 While extensive studies2 in the underdoped HTSr's reveal various anomalies in both the normal and superconducting states of the compounds, data on overdoped HTSr's are sparse. Therefore, it would be interesting to find and study high quality samples of overdoped HTSr's.

It was demonstrated a few years ago that YSr2Cu3O7.5 under a high (YSCO), isostructural to YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO), forms only under high oxygen pressure,3 or at ambient pressure in air by the partial substitution of Cu in the CuO chain in YSCO by elements of valence greater than +2.4 In view of the similar chemical and structural characteristics of YSCO and YBCO, the presence of a high oxygen partial pressure during the formation of YSCO suggests that the YSCO sample so prepared may be heavily overdoped.

We have therefore synthesized YSr2Cu3O7.5 under a high pressure of 3 GPa at \(\sim\)1050 degC and studied the pressure effect on its \(T_{c}\) up to 1.6 GPa. We found that the \(T_{c}\) of YSr2Cu3O7.5 increases with pressure at a large rate, \(dT_{c}/dP\), of \(\sim\!+3\) K/GPa, similar to an underdoped HTSr but in contrast to the heavily overdoped nature of the sample based on the thermogravimetric and thermoelectric power (TEP) measurements. The implications of this observation will be discussed.

## II Experiment

The samples were prepared by thoroughly mixing powders of Y2O3 (99.5%), SrO (99.5%), and CuO (99.95%) with the cation ratio Y:Sr:Cu = 1:2:3. The powder mixture was heated in an alumina crucible at \(\sim\)980 degC for 60 h in a flowing O2 with several intermittent grindings to form the precursor. Such a high-temperature heat treatment was shown5 to minimize the C contamination from the air. The precursor was then mixed with the oxidizing agent KClO3 in a molar ratio of KClO3:YSr2Cu3O6.5=_x_ for 0\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)2, and pressed into cylinders of 4 mm \(\oslash\) x7 mm. The pellets were wrapped with gold foil and loaded into the sample chamber of a Rockland Research piston-cylinder high-pressure rig, using MgO as a pressure medium, and a graphite furnace. The pellets were pressurized to \(\sim\)3 GPa and heated to 1000-1050 degC for 2-8 h before being quenched to room temperature.

The structure of the sample was characterized by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D-MAX/BIII diffractometer with the Cu(K_a_) line and the composition by Japan Electron Optics Laboratory energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDAX). The oxygen content \(y\) in YSr2Cu3O7 is determined by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) employing a TA Instruments Thermal Analyst Model 2100. The thermopower measurement was made using a high-precision technique previously developed.6 The superconducting transition at ambient was determined resistively by the standard four-lead method using a Linear Research LR-400 bridge and magnetically using a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer. Under pressure, the transition was determined resistively. The high-pressure environment was generated by the modified clamp technique inside a Teflon cell housed in a Be-Cu cylinder,7 using the 3M fluorinert as the pressure medium. The temperature was determined by an alumel-chromel thermocouple and the pressure by a superconducting Pb manometer; both were situated next to the sample inside the high-pressure cell.

## III Results and Discussion

The XRD results show that all YSCO samples, with an oxidant KClO3 to YSr2Cu3O6.5 molar ratio 0\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)2 made under 3 GPa at 1000-1050 degC, contain mainly the YSr2Cu3O7 phase with varying small amounts of oxide impurities, as exemplified in Fig. 1 for \(x\)\(=\) 0.45. The cation composition of Y:Sr:Cu from EDAX measurements is 1:2:(2.9\(-\)3) across the YSCO grains. It is interesting to note that the YSCO sample prepared with low \(x\) displayed a certain degree of orthorhombicity which decreases to zero with increasing \(x\), as evident in inset of Fig. 1 where the orthorhombic (200) and (020) lines merge into the tetragonal (200) line with increasing \(x\). A similar orthorhombic to tetragonal transition with \(x\) was also observed in YBCO previously.8 The purest samples were obtained for \(x\)\(\sim\) 0.45. The lattice parameters for these samples were \(a\)\(=\) 3.795 A and \(c\)\(=\) 11.38 A, in agreement with the previous reports.3 Therefore only samples synthesized with \(x\) = 0.45 were examined in this investigation.

TGA data give an oxygen content \(y\) = 7.5 +- 0.2 in our samples as prepared with \(x\) = 0.45. This suggests that the YSCO sample is heavily overdoped, since the optimal doping of \(y_{o}\) is ~6.95 for YBCO. The TEP measurements provide a value of -2.6 mV/K at 290 K, showing again that the sample is overdoped,9 although not so heavily doped as compared with the \(y\) = 7.5 suggests.

The YSCO samples prepared by the high-pressure synthesis technique usually display a small Meissner volume fraction of only a few percent in an external field of 1 mT.3,4 This has been attributed to the possibly low carrier concentration of the compound.4 By minimizing the C contamination through high-temperature heating the starting materials and adjusting the synthesis conditions, a Meissner volume fraction of >=15% with an onset transition at 63.5 K was achieved in our samples at 0.5 mT (Fig. 2). A volume fraction >50% was detected by reducing the measuring field to below 0.1 mT. This suggests that the previously observed low volume fraction can be attributed to the pinning in the samples.

The YSCO samples as synthesized behave as a metal resistively above the superconducting transition which is between 64 and 59 K with a tail to 54 K. Under pressure the superconducting transition is shifted upward in parallel as shown in Fig. 3. The midpoint transition temperature (\(T_{c}\)) is plotted as a function of pressure in Fig. 4, showing a linear \(P\) dependence of \(T_{c}\) at a rate of +3 K/GPa.

A universal quadratic \(p\) dependence of \(T_{c}\) has been proposed for HTSr's,1 i.e., \(T_{c}\) = _T__c_max[1 - _a_(_p_ - \(p_{o}\))2], where _T__c_max is the highest \(T_{c}\) when the HTSr is optimally doped at \(p\) = \(p_{o}\) and \(a\) is a constant which determines the doping range where superconductivity occurs. Based on this \(T_{c}\)(_p_) relation, various phenomenological models.10 were advanced to account for the pressure effect on \(T_{c}\) of HTSr's. By assuming that \(P\) affects only \(p\) via _P_-induced charge transfer,11\(dT_{c}/dP\) is expected to be positive when \(p\) < \(p_{o}\) , zero when \(p\) = \(p_{o}\) and negative when \(p\) > \(p_{o}\) . This seems to agree qualitatively with earlier studies. However, later investigations showed that, even for optimally doped HTSr's, _dT__c_/_dP_ is nonzero and positive. By allowing \(P\) to influence _T__c_max at a rate of _dT__c_max/_dP_ = 0.96 K/GPa via a channel other than \(P\)

  induced charge transfer,[12] the \(T_{c}(P)\) behavior of YBa\({}_{2-x}\)La\({}_{x}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) and (Y\({}_{1-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\))Ba\({}_{x}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) over a fairly wide doping range was understood. YSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{y}\) is isostructurally and chemically similar to YBCO; one would therefore expect the similar model applicable to YSCO, i.e., \(dT_{c}/dP\) is negative or if positive should be small (\(<\)\(dT_{c}^{\rm max}/dP\)) when YSCO is heavily doped, as indicated by the TGA and TEP data. Unfortunately, the observed \(dT_{c}/dP\) of YSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7.5}\) is \(+3\) K/GPa which is three times the value of \(d\)\(T_{c}^{\rm max}/dP\) proposed for the YBCO system.[12] Three possibilities arise for the observation: (1) the YSCO samples examined are not overdoped, (2) the \(dT_{c}^{\rm max}/dP\) of YSCO is much larger than that of YBCO, and (3) the pressure-induced charge-transfer model is inappropriate in this case.

Previous studies revealed that C can enter the YSCO (YBCO) lattice by replacing all Cu in the CuO chain for every \(n\) CuO chains to form at ambient pressure the oxycarbonate Y\({}_{n}\)Sr\({}_{2n}\)Cu\({}_{3n-1}\)(CO\({}_{3}\))O\({}_{7n-3}\)[Y\({}_{n}\)Ba\({}_{2n}\)Cu\({}_{3n-1}\)(CO\({}_{3}\))O\({}_{7n-3}\)] (Ref. [13]) or by replacing part of the Cu in the CuO chain to form also at ambient pressure YSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3-z}\)(CO\({}_{3}\))O\({}_{7-z}\) [YBa\({}_{2n}\)Cu\({}_{3-z}\)(CO\({}_{3}\))O\({}_{7-z}\)] (Ref. [14]) which is actually the disordered \(n\!=\!1/z\) member of the previous homologous series. The incorporation of C into YSCO (YBCO) results in a substantial reduction in the \(c\) axis of the basic orthorhombic cell, the formation of superlattices and a great suppression of \(T_{c}\) . It also leads to a reduction of hole concentration for a fixed oxygen content and the reduction increases rapidly with the C content. This may be responsible for the absence of superconductivity in the YSCO oxycarbonates even after annealing in a 5 MPa O\({}_{2}\) atmosphere, previously reported.[14] Although the XRD data showed that the structure of YSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7.5}\) was tetragonal, with \(a\) = 3.795 A and \(c\!=\!11.38\) A, and the EDAX results gave a cation ratio of Y:Sr:Cu\(=\!1\!:\!2\)(2.9\(-\)3.0) within our resolution of a few percent, a small amount of C contamination cannot be excluded in our samples which may be expressed as YSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3-z}\)C\({}_{z}\)O\({}_{7.5}\). It should be noted that neither K nor Cl was detected in the YSCO grains. Assuming that the maximum possible Cu deficiency is due to C contamination, i.e., \(z\!=\!0.1\), and that the C distributes itself uniformly in the sample, it gives a C/Cu\(=\!1/29\), in agreement with our gas-effusion cell measurements, corresponding to the \(n\!=\!10\) member of the YSCO oxycarbonate. The average Cu valence in the sample remains to be an overdoped value of \(+\!2.6\)\(\pm\!0.1\), in comparison with the optimal value of \(+\!2.33\) for YBCO. For the Cu valence in the oxycarbonate YSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3-z}\)C\({}_{z}\)O\({}_{7.5}\) to be less than \(+\!2.33\) and therefore to be underdoped, \(z\) has to be greater than 0.6. It has been shown[14] that oxycarbonate YSCO is not superconducting, even with a smaller \(z\!=\!0.4\) which results in a lattice parameter \(c\) as small as 11.185 A. Increasing the oxygen content of such a \(z\!>\!0.5\) compound is expected to further reduce \(c\). On the other hand, our YSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7.5}\) is superconducting and has a \(c\) = 11.38 A. Therefore, YSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7.5}\) must contain \(z\!\leq\!0.4\) and cannot be changed from its overdoped state to an underdoped state by C incorporation, provided that the ionic model is still valid for each O atom to provide two holes for \(y\!>\!7\).

It was shown previously that the pressure induced charge transfer depends on the filling of the O sites in the CuO chain layer in YBCO.[15] For YSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7.5}\), the O-site filling can be very different from the underdoped YBCO and therefore the pressure induced charge transfer may not play an important role. The large positive \(dT_{c}/dP\) observed must be associated with factors other than carrier density.[16] Whether this is characteristic of an overdoped HTSr or specific to overdoped YSCO remains unresolved. A heavily overdoped YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7.5}\) is being prepared and investigated.
