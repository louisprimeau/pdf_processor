###### Abstract

The superconductor Sn_(1 − x)In_(x)Te is a doped topological crystalline
insulator and has become important as a candidate topological
superconductor, but its superconducting phase diagram is poorly
understood. By measuring about 50 samples of high-quality, vapor-grown
single crystals, we found that the dependence of the superconducting
transition temperature T_(c) on the In content x presents a qualitative
change across the critical doping x_(c) ≃ 3.8

PHYSICAL REVIEW B **88**, 140502(R) (2013)

Recently, superconductors derived from topological insulators are
attracting significant attention,[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] because they have a potential to be
topological superconductors.[21, 22, 23] Topological superconductors are
characterized by a nontrivial topology of the superconducting wave
functions,[21, 22, 23] and they necessarily harbor gapless surface
quasiparticle states that often consist of Majorana fermions,[24] an
exotic kind of particle that is its own antiparticle.

In this context, the superconductor[25, 26] Sn_(1 − x)In_(x)Te is of
interest, because it is derived from SnTe, which is a new type of
topological insulator called a topological crystalline insulator.[27,
28, 29, 29] Intriguingly, this material (with x ≃ 0.045) preserves[20]
the topological surface state above T_(c) and, furthermore, was found to
present signatures of surface Andreev bound states in the point contact
spectroscopy.[18] Given that the existence of surface Andreev bound
states is a hallmark of unconventional superconductivity[30] and that
the symmetry of the effective Hamiltonian of Sn_(1 − x)In_(x)Te implies
that an unconventional superconductivity in this material is bound to be
topological,[18] Sn_(1 − x)In_(x)Te has become a strong candidate for a
topological superconductor.

Because of the heightened interest in Sn_(1 − x)In_(x)Te, it is
important to establish its phase diagram with respect to In doping. In
particular, Sn_(1 − x)In_(x)Te in the low In-doping range is known to
present a ferroelectric transition at low temperature, accompanied by a
structural phase transition from cubic to rhombohedral,[31, 32, 33, 34]
and the signatures of surface Andreev bound states were observed[18] for
x ≃ 0.045, which is close to this ferroelectric phase. Therefore, it is
useful to clarify the details of the superconducting phase diagram in
the low In-doping range that is only poorly understood.[26] Also, since
the superconducting transition temperature T_(c) of Sn_(1 − x)In_(x)Te
is unusually high[35, 36] for its carrier density of ∼10²¹ cm⁻³ and it
has been proposed that impurity scattering might be _enhancing_ the
T_(c) in this system,[37] it would be interesting to see how the T_(c)
is related to disorder in Sn_(1 − x)In_(x)Te.

In this Rapid Communication, we report the phase diagram of
Sn_(1 − x)In_(x)Te for x = 0.018-0.08 based on the measurements of 51
single-crystal samples. It was found that robust, fully gapped
superconductivity is established for the entire doping range studied,
but the dependence of T_(c) on x in the ferroelectric rhombohedral phase
is clearly different from that in the cubic phase where T_(c) vs x is
confirmed to be essentially linear, as was previously reported.[26] Our
data suggest that the T_(c) in the rhombohedral phase is primarily
governed by the level of disorder, and surprisingly, T_(c) tends to
become _higher_ in more disordered samples. This tendency seems to exist
also in the cubic phase, although there the T_(c) is primarily
determined by carrier density and the change in T_(c) with disorder is
much weaker. Hence, even though the electron pairing is expected to be
driven by electron-phonon interactions in this material,[18, 36, 37]
there is a certain unusual aspect in the pairing mechanism.

The single crystals of Sn_(1 − x)In_(x)Te were grown by a
vapor-transport method. A stoichiometric ratio of high purity elements
of Sn (99.99

Let us begin by examining the role of In doping. There are two sources
of hole carriers in Sn_(1 − x)In_(x)Te. The parent compound SnTe is
always Sn deficient and is better written as Sn_(1 − x)Te, where δ is
usually around ∼1

Now we focus on the behavior of T_(c). Figure 2 shows the T_(c) vs p
plot for all the samples measured in this work. The T_(c)’s of 29
samples were measured with resistivity, and those of 22 samples were
measured with specific heat. In both cases, T_(c) is determined from the
midpoint of the transition, and the error bar signifies the transition
width. The data are primarily shown against p, because we found that
T_(c) shows better systematics against p rather than against x.[39] In
Fig. 2, using the upper horizontal axis, we also show $x_{\rm ref}$,
which is calculated from p using the linear relation found in Fig. 1, to
give reference to the doping level per formula unit in this plot.

The lower limit of p where we found superconductivity is 2.2 × 10²⁰
cm⁻³, which corresponds to $x_{\rm ref}\simeq 0.019$ and is consistent
with the previous report.[26] However, while it was reported in Ref.
[26] the T_(c) linearly increases with increasing x once
superconductivity with T_(c) > 0.3 K is induced in samples with
x ≳ 0.02, we found that such a trend only exists for p above a critical
value p_(c) ≃ 4.8 × 10²⁰ cm⁻³, which corresponds to
$x_{\rm ref}\simeq 0.038$. Strikingly, this p_(c) is essentially the
same as the critical hole density $p_{c}^{\rm FE}$ above which the
ferroelectric rhombohedral phase disappears.[26; 40] Below this critical
p_(c), we found that T_(c) shows virtually no correlation with p and
spreads rather widely between 1.3 and 1.9 K. It is interesting to note
that the highest T_(c) of 1.9 K in this study was observed in samples at
low doping, p ≃ 2.7 × 10²⁰ and 3.5 × 10²⁰ cm⁻³, and it exceeds the T_(c)
of maximally doped samples. On the other hand, the lowest T_(c) ≈ 1.2 K
was only observed in samples near p_(c) on the cubic-structure side.

To understand this puzzling behavior, we show in Fig. 3 the plots of
T_(c) versus the residual resistivity at 4 K, $\rho_{4\,\rm K}$, for
several p values at which three or more samples were measured. Note that
$\rho_{4\,\rm K}$ gives a measure of the strength of impurity scattering
in the sample. One can see a clear trend that T_(c) is _enhanced_ as
$\rho_{4\,\rm K}$ becomes larger. In particular, the highest T_(c) of
1.9 K was observed in samples with a relatively large $\rho_{4\,\rm K}$
of 0.6-0.7 mΩ cm, which is very unusual. This unusual trend is most
obvious in samples with p < p_(c) and it is weaker for p > p_(c), but it
seems that the same trend still exists at large p. Altogether, the
results shown in Figs. 2 and 3 strongly suggest that T_(c) is mainly
determined by the unusual enhancement due to impurity scattering in the
ferroelectric rhombohedral phase, while in the cubic phase it is
determined primarily by p but is still affected by the impurity
scattering in an unusual manner.

It is well known that in unconventional superconductors, the pairing gap
is strongly suppressed by impurity scattering.[41; 42; 43; 44; 45] In
conventional BCS superconductors, on the other hand, T_(c) is known to
be insensitive to weak disorder.[46] The present observation is at odds
with both cases, and hence is very peculiar. Nevertheless, it was argued
by Martin and Phillips[37] that nonmagnetic impurities in
Sn_(1 − x)In_(x)Te and Pb_(1 − x)In_(x)Te could enhance T_(c) due to
their dual role of reducing the on-site Coulomb repulsion and enhancing
the density of states at the Fermi energy (in this theory, the
negative-U mechanism[47] is not involved). Therefore, our observation is
not without theoretical justification. Apparently, more microscopic
studies to elucidate the pairing mechanism in Sn_(1 − x)In_(x)Te are
strongly called for.

showing $x_{\rm ref}$. Depending on the sample, T_(c) was measured
either with resistivity (open circles) or with specific heat (open
squares). The vertical dashed line marks p_(c) to separate the two
different structure phases. The vertical error bar signifies the
transition width, which was defined with the resistivity change from 90

$c_{\rm In}$ (upper axis). The solid line is a least-square fit to the
data and the dashed line indicates the approximate hole density for
x = 0–0.017 reported in Ref. [26].

Given that the behavior of T_(c) for p < p_(c) is very unusual and that
it was previously suggested [26] that bulk superconductivity may not be
established in this regime, it is useful to investigate the
specific-heat anomaly associated with the superconductivity in this
phase. Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity
ρ_(xx) of a sample in the ferroelectric rhombohedral phase having
p = 3.2 × 10²⁰ cm⁻³ (x = 0.025), which showed ρ_(4 K) = 0.46 mΩ cm and
T_(c) = 1.42 K with a narrow transition width of 22 mK. The
characteristic kink in the ρ_(xx)(T) behavior associated with the
structural phase transition [26] is not clearly seen in this sample,
probably because the resistivity at the transition is already dominated
by impurity scattering rather than by phonon scattering. The
specific-heat data of the same sample is shown in Fig. 4(b) in terms of
c_(el)/T vs T. Here, c_(el) is the electronic specific heat obtained
after subtracting the phonon contribution from the total specific heat
[48]. The normal-state electronic specific-heat coefficient γ_(a) = 0.87
mJ/mol K² is indicated by the dashed line. One notices that c_(el)/T in
0 T approaches zero at low temperature, which gives evidence that this
sample is 100

The c_(el)/T data in 0 T was fitted with the modified BCS theory [49]
which allows variation of the coupling constant α ( ≡ Δ₀/T_(c), with Δ₀
the superconducting gap at 0 K). The fitting shown in Fig. 4(b) is made
so that it correctly reproduces the jump near T_(c)[50]; the resulting
α, 1.77, is essentially the same as the weak-coupling value of 1.76. The
data at lower temperature deviate only slightly from the fitting curve,
suggesting that the BCS theory gives a reasonably good description of
the specific-heat behavior.

To complement the above specific-heat data for the rhombohedral phase,
similar data measured on samples in the cubic phase (p > p_(c)) are
shown in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d) for p ≃ 5 × 10²⁰ cm⁻³ (x ≃ 0.04,
T_(c) = 1.22 K) and p ≃ 7 × 10²⁰ cm⁻³ (x ≃ 0.05, T_(c) = 1.41 K),
respectively. The fittings using the modified BCS theory are again made
so that they correctly reproduce the jump near T_(c); the obtained α
values, 1.83 and 1.88, are larger than that for x = 0.025, but otherwise
the data are reasonably well described by the modified BCS theory.

Now we discuss the implications of our data. Between the ferroelectric
rhombohedral phase and the cubic phase, the difference in the doping
dependence of T_(c) seems to suggest that the pairing mechanism is
somewhat different. Such an inference is corroborated by the fact that
the unusual enhancement of T_(c) with impurity scattering is prominently
observed in the rhombohedral phase, while this effect is much weaker in
the cubic phase. In this regard, it is useful to note that the
Martin-Phillips theory [37] for the enhancement of T_(c) due to impurity
scattering is within the framework of the BCS theory, and therefore the
superconductivity in the rhombohedral phase is not necessarily
unconventional [51].

Figure 4: (Color online) (a) ρ_(xx)(T) of a sample in the ferroelectric
rhombohedral phase (p < p_(c)). p = 3.2 × 10²⁰ cm⁻³ (x = 0.025); the
inset show the sharp superconducting transition at T_(c) = 1.42 K. (b)
c_(el)/T vs T of the same sample measured down to 0.34 K in 0 T (red
circles) and in 2 T (blue circles). (c), c_(el)/T vs T plots for samples
in the cubic phase (p > p_(c)), p ≃ 5 × 10²⁰ cm⁻³ (x ≃ 0.04,
T_(c) = 1.22 K) and p ≃ 7 × 10²⁰ cm⁻³ (x ≃ 0.05, T_(c) = 1.41 K); those
samples were only characterized with specific heat. In (b)–(d), solid
lines show the modified BCS fits to the experimental data with tunable
α, and dashed lines indicate the values of γ_(b).

Figure 3: (Color online) Dependencies of T_(c) on ρ_(4 K) for five p
values (in units of 10²⁰ cm⁻³), 2.8, 3.6, 5.8, 9.2, and 10.5. The first
two are in the ferroelectric rhombohedral phase (p < p_(c)), while the
last three are in the cubic phase (p > p_(c)).

We would like to mention that we have measured one sample with T_(c) =
1.9 K in the rhombohedral phase with the same point-contact technique
used in Refs. [8] and [18] found that the spectra present a two-peak
structure that is akin to the conventional Andreev reflection spectra
described by the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk theory.[52] On the other hand,
we have consistently observed a single zero-bias conductance peak in
seven samples so far measured with T_(c)≃ 1.2 K. We therefore speculate
that in Sn_(1 − x)In_(x)Te the even- and odd-parity pairing states may
be competing and, since the odd-parity state is expected to be
suppressed with nonmagnetic impurities,[41, 42, 43, 44, 45] the
conventional even-parity state wins in samples with high T_(c)’s where
impurity scattering is strong. If this is indeed the case, the
odd-parity state is realized only in the lowest T_(c) samples where the
impurity scattering is the weakest.

In the ferroelectric rhombohedral phase, there is no Brillouin-zone
folding and the Fermi surface volume is expected to be unchanged from
that in the cubic phase. Nevertheless, establishment of the
ferroelectric phase is accompanied with generations of ferroelectric
domains and charge polarizations, which may have something to do with
the present observation. In particular, ferroelectric domain boundaries
are expected to be pinned by structural defects in crystals, and hence
more disordered samples would contain higher densities of ferroelectric
domain boundaries to cause strong electron scattering.

It is prudent to note that all the specific-heat data are reasonably
well described by the BCS theory throughout the doping range, which
implies that the gap magnitude is always nearly isotropic. However, this
does not necessarily contradict the possible realization of odd-parity
pairing in low T_(c) samples suggested by the point-contact spectroscopy
made on samples with T_(c)≃ 1.2 K, because the specific-heat behavior is
expected to be essentially the same between the isotropic even-parity
pairing and the fully gapped odd-parity pairing.[53] In this context,
the coupling constant α to phenomenologically explain the data is found
to be slightly _larger_ in the T_(c) = 1.22 K sample [Fig. 4(c)]
compared to the α in the T_(c) = 1.44 K sample [Fig. 4(b)], which is at
odds with the natural expectation that stronger coupling leads to higher
T_(c); this seems to support the idea that the pairing mechanism is
different between the two phases.

In summary, we have elucidated the superconducting phase diagram of
Sn_(1 − x)In_(x)Te as a function of In doping for x< 8
