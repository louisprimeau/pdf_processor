## I Introduction

Recently, there has been continuing interest in the search, discovery, and characterization of materials that exhibit exotic collective electronic phenomena in different bonding and structure types. High T_{C} cuprates, Sr_{2}RuO_{4}, some organic and heavy fermion metals are examples of materials which exhibit low dimensional superconductivity gaps or anisotropic Fermi surfaces. [1, 2, 3, 4] The true character of anisotropy is one of the most important questions to be addressed, and in that context quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials are the extreme examples in nature. [5, 6, 7, 8] Transition metal chalcogenides often host quasi-1D conducting electrons due to the existence of metal chains in their crystal structure, where band dispersion along the chain is an order of magnitude larger than dispersion in the direction perpendicular to chains. Intermetallic phases on the selenium-rich side of the Nb-Se phase diagram, such as NbSe_{2} and NbSe_{3}, are fruitful model materials for the study of low dimensional superconductivity and charge density waves (CDW). [9, 10] On the other hand, the niobium-rich side of the Nb-Se phase diagram has been far less explored, with the exception of Nb_{3}Se_{4} which is a superconductor with T_{C}=2.31 K. [11] In this work we show bulk superconductivity and examine the character of anisotropy in the normal and superconducting states of Nb_{2}Se_{3}, [12] a quasi-1D conductor whose normal state electronic transport is dominated by electron-electron Umklapp scattering. [13]

## II Crystal structure

Nb_{2}Se_{3} crystallizes in the monoclinic P_{21m} crystal structure where Nb atoms form two types of infinite metal-metal chains running in the b-axis direction: Nb(1) and Nb(2). Interatomic distances in the Nb(1) chain are comparable to those in pure metal (2.97 A), whereas metal distances in the Nb(2) chain are somewhat longer (3.13 A). [14] The origin of metal clustering in this crystal structure is due to its main building block, M_{2}X_{6} chains (Fig. 1) which are present in many M_{2}X_{3} metal-clustering transition metal chalcogenides (M\!=\!Mo, Se,Ta; X\!=\!S, Se). [15]M_{2}X_{6} chains are formed by double edge sharing of MX_{4} chains which are in turn formed by edge sharing of ideal MX_{6} octahedra. Metal-metal bond formation across the shared octahedral edge in MX_{4}-type chains causes formation of Nb(2) chains and distortion from ideal octahedral building blocks in Nb_{2}Se_{6} clusters. Electrical transport properties and potential structural instabilities in these systems are governed by the bands formed from the set of unfilled t_{2g} orbitals.

Due to metal clustering in the basic Nb_{2}Se_{6} building blocks, band structure is comprised of flat bands originating from Nb(2)-Nb(2) bonding across the shared edge of the NbSe_{4} chains and rather dispersive bands formed from x^{2}-y^{2} orbitals along the Nb(1) chain. Nb_{2}Se_{3} is isostructural with Mo_{2}S_{3} where metal-metal distances in both Mo(1) and Mo(2) chains are comparable to those in pure Mo metal. Peierls distortion associated with half-filled t_{2g} block bands due to the oxidation state of Mo atoms [M\varsigma^{3\xi}(d^{3})] double the unit cell so Mo_{2}S_{3} exhibits CDW transition. On the other hand, there is no CDW formation in Nb_{2}Se_{3} since the oxidation state of Nb atoms is Nb^{3+} (d^{2}). Consequently, Nb_{2}Se_{3} is a good model material for the study of low dimensional electronic transport along metallic chains down to the lowest temperatures without partial destruction of the Fermi surface due to CDW formation, as is the case in many transition metal oxides and chalcogenides.

## III Experiment

Powder x-ray patterns were taken at room temperature using a Rigaku Miniflex with CuK_{n} radiation. The data were collected using 2 \theta scan in the 10^{\circ}-90^{\circ} range. Several different single crystals were oriented by a Laue camera. Electrical contacts were made with Epotek H20E silver epoxy for current along the b-axis of the crystal as well as perpendicular to the b axis in the a-c plane (parallel and perpendicular to Nb-Nb chains). The electrical resistivity was measured in a Quantum Design PPMS-9 in the temperature range from 0.4-300 K and up to 90 kOe. The heat capacity was measured using a relaxation technique in the same instrument. The magnetic susceptibility was measured in a Quantum Design MPMS XL-5. The dimensions of the samples were measured by a high precision optical microscope, the Nikon SMZ-800 with 10 \mum resolution, and average values are presented. Electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity were reproduced on several independently grown samples from different batches in order to exclude sample dependence.

## IV Results

The synthesis of large single crystals allowed us to study the anisotropy in the normal and superconducting state of Nb_{2}Se_{3}. Single crystals of Nb_{2}Se_{3} were grown using a molten metallic flux technique, thus avoiding possible contamination and intercalation of transport agent atoms. [16, 17, 18] Crystals grew as thin platelike rods with the long rod axis being the b axis of the crystal structure along the Nb-Nb metal chains. Crystal structure parameters of flux grown Nb_{2}Se_{3} crystals are in good agreement with previously published: a=5.5051(2) A, b=3.4349(2) A, c=9.2369(4) A, and monoclinic angle \beta=130.16(1)^{\circ}. The anisotropy in electrical transport for current applied both along and perpendicular to the chain direction at high temperatures is shown in Fig. 2(a). The resistivity of our flux grown samples for current I\uparrow\uparrowb axis (p_{P}) is in good agreement with the data from crystals obtained using a vapor transport technique. [13] Electrical transport for the current perpendicular to the chains, I\perpb axis (p_{N}), is up to an order of magnitude larger, implying less band structure anisotropy than in other linear chain inorganic materials and probably less difference in the band dispersion energy parallel to chains (b axis) and perpendicular to it. [19, 20] The resistivity decreases with decrease in temperature approaching residual resistivity values below 4 K, p_{P}=26 \mu\Omega cm and p_{N}=105 \mu\Omega cm. Figures 1(b) and 1(c) show the temperature dependence of the resistivity after subtracting the residual resistivity that has been estimated by the extrapolation of the p_{P} and p_{N} curves to T=0.

The clustering of atoms in chains results in the quasi-one-dimensional conduction band model first proposed by Kamimura on the example of (SN)_{x}. [13, 21] It was shown that electron-electron Umklapp scattering dominates the electronic transport, whereas electron-phonon and electron-electron normal scattering are negligible. [22] The temperature dependence of the resistivity is given by the power law \rho-\rho_{0}=CT^{n} (C=const.). For k_{B}T\leqslant(0.1-0.3)\gamma, where \gamma is the interchain interaction energy, n takes values of 2 \leqslant n \leqslant 3, and for k_{B}T>\mid\gamma, n=1. The power law fit of both \rho_{P} and \rho_{N} in Fig. 2(b) is possible below T=15 K whereas a linear temperature dependence is observed above T=250 K. The resistivity for I\uparrow\uparrowb axis takes the form \rho=\rho_{0}+CT^{n} with n =2.1\pm0.1, C=(1.40\pm 0.02)10^{-8}\Omega cm/K^{n}, and resistivity for I\perpb axis has the same temperature dependence with n =2.07\pm0.04, C=(7.1\pm 0.7)10^{-8}\Omega cm/K^{n}.

Low temperature thermodynamic, magnetic, and transport properties are shown in Fig. 3. The jump \Delta ct T=2.0 K in the specific heat and 25% of unsaturated -1/4 \pi value in M/H data at the lowest temperature of our measurement (1.8 K) suggest a bulk superconducting transition in Nb_{2}Se_{3}. Electrical transport measurements show a somewhat higher transition temperature. For current applied along the chains as well as perpendicular to chains (b axis) the onset of the superconducting transition is at T_{\rho}^{onset}=2.4 K. At T=2.2 K the transition to the superconducting state for the b-axis (p_{P}

 resistivity is complete whereas resistivity for I \perp _b_-axis (\rho_{N}) shows a structure and the change of slope. Finally, at bulk _T__{C}=2.0 K, \rho_{N} is fully superconducting. Magnetic susceptibility _M_/_H_ is diamagnetic already at T_{o}^{onset} and its magnitude grows towards bulk superconductivity below _T__{C}=2.0 K. By fitting the temperature dependence of the specific heat in the normal state using C = \gamma T+ \beta T^{3}, we obtain _C_/_T_ = \gamma =9.96 +- 0.2 mJ/mol k^{2} and \theta_{D}=223 +- 3 K using the relation \theta_{D}^{3}= (12/5) (\pi^{2}nR/\beta), where R is the gas constant and n is the number of atoms per molecule.

Figure 4 presents temperature-dependent electrical resistivity data for Nb2Se3 taken at a variety of applied fields for H <= 12 kOe for field applied parallel and perpendicular to Nb chains and for the current running parallel and perpendicular to Nb chains. Two features are evident: there is a suppression of the superconducting phase to lower temperatures for increasing applied field, and there is a negligible magnetoresistivity in the normal state. The decrease of _T__{C} for I \uparrow \uparrow b axis tracks the data well for I \perp b axis for a fixed field direction. On the other hand, suppression of superconductivity is much stronger for H \perp b axis (Nb chains) than for a field applied along the b axis (parallel to Nb chains). A closer look at the temperature dependent resistivity for I \perp b axis reveals a step in the superconducting transition that persists up to 1 kOe. Using these data, _H__{c2}(_T_) curve can be deduced (Fig. 5). We notice an almost linear temperature dependence and relatively large anisotropy of the _H__{c2}(_T_) curve for a magnetic field applied parallel and perpendicular to the Nb chains. There is no sign of saturation down to the lowest temperature of our measurement, 0.4 K.

By extrapolating _H__{c2}(_T_) data to _T_=0 we get values of _H__{c2}(0)=7.5 kOe (_H_ \perp Nb chains) and _H__{c2}(0)=14 kOe (_H_ \uparrow \uparrow Nb chains), which is significantly larger. Taken as a whole, the temperature dependence of _H__{c2} for Nb2Se3 is similar to that found for other quasi-one-dimensional superconductors, for example TaSe3, Nb3Se4, and Nb3S4. By using _B__{C2}(_T_)=[\Phi 0/2\pi\xi(_T_)] we obtain coherence lengths \xi(0)=203 \AA and \xi(0)=153 \AA for a field applied perpendicular and parallel to Nb chains, respectively, a bit shorter than in Nb metal \xi(0)=380 \AA.

## V Discussion

Electronic transport in the normal state can be understood in the framework of the theory of Oshiyama and Kamimura.[22] However, our results imply that electron-electron Umklapp scattering is dominant not only along the chain axis of a quasi-one-dimensional metal but also perpendicular to it. The linear resistivity above 250 K and a \rho\sim_T_^{2.1} temperature dependence of resistivity for both \rho_{P} and \rho_{N} below _T_=15 K, are consistent with the possible range of the chain interaction energy 45 K <= \gamma <= 150 K. We note that the power law temperature dependence of resistivity in vapor transport grown crystals extends up to 40 K, implying a larger value of \gamma than what we obtained in our work on flux grown crystals. The difference could arise due to the presence of other scattering mechanisms besides electron-electron Umklapp scattering. Alternatively, this may imply that the interchain interaction energy is sensitive to crystalline disorder and imperfections. The flux grown crystals have a higher residual resistivity value \rho_{0}=26 \mu\Omega cm for the current applied parallel to Nb chains along the b axis of the crystal compared to crystals grown by vapor transport reaction where \rho_{0}=0.5 \mu\Omega cm.[13]

We turn now to the properties of the superconducting state. Using McMillan's expression[23]

  \[T_{C}=\frac{\Theta_{D}}{1.45}\exp\left\{-\frac{1.04(1+\lambda)}{\lambda-\mu^{*}(1+0 .62\lambda)}\right\}\] (1)

and the value of the Debye temperature from the heat capacity analysis \theta_{D}=223 K, we estimate the value of the electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda = 1.05 assuming the empirical value of pseudopotential \mu^{*} = 0.1. These results put Nb_{2}Se_{3} in the class of the intermediate to strong coupling superconductors. The specific-heat jump \Delta C/(\gamma T_{C}) = 0.5 (Fig. 3) is substantially smaller than the mean-field BCS value of 1.43.[24] in the weak-coupling superconductors, the reduced specific heat jump can be interpreted in the terms of the energy gap anisotropy. The effects of an anisotropic energy gap on the thermodynamic properties of the BCS superconductors have been calculated in the seminal work of John Clemm:

\[\Delta C/(\gamma T_{C})=1.426(1-4\langle a^{2}\rangle),\] (2)

where \langle a^{2}\rangle, the mean-squared anisotropy, is the average over the Fermi surface of the square of the deviation of the energy-gap parameter from its average.[25] Strong coupling effects and anisotropy in general tend to work in opposite direction and the specific heat jump would be enhanced by strong coupling. This would imply a rather strong anisotropy of the superconducting gap in Nb_{2}Se_{3}. Equation (2) therefore gives a rather conservative estimate of \langle a^{2}\rangle = 0.16. Table 1 compares the value of electron phonon coupling parameter and the gap anisotropy for several anisotropic superconductors.

Nb_{2}Se_{3} exhibits zero resistivity for current applied along the b axis of the crystal, parallel to Nb chains (\rho_{p}) at T = 2.2 K, whereas the onset of this transition and the transition to a diamagnetic M/H is at T_{\rho}^{onset}=2.4 K. However, the heat capacity shows a transition to a bulk superconducting state at bulk T_{C}=2.0 K, where magnetic susceptibility data for M/H shows a dive towards full Meissner effect. These results suggest that the superconductivity of Nb_{2}Se_{3} is a bulk effect below T_{C} \sim 2.0 K and filamentary in nature between T_{\rho}^{onset} and T_{C}. Nb_{2}Se_{3} can be regarded as an aggregate of one-dimensional chains that are weakly coupled through Josephson-type junctions since the distance between the Nb atoms in a chain is metallic but the interchain distance exceeds the metallic distance. The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity for current I \perp b axis (\rho_{N} is perpendicular to Nb chains) is consistent with this interpretation. The onset temperature T_{\rho}^{onset} is the same for both \rho_{p} and \rho_{N}, however \rho_{N} shows zero resistivity only at bulk T_{C} and a feature indicating another superconducting transition at T=2.2 K that is visible in applied magnetic field up to 1 kOe. An alternative explanation for this is a small misorientation in the current direction during electrical transport measurement perpendicular to the Nb chains. However, that would imply the presence of two T_{C}'s in two different electronic substructures and negligible interband scattering.[26]

## VI VI Conclusion

In summary, we have showed bulk superconductivity and have investigated the anisotropy in electrical transport properties in the normal and in the superconducting state of Nb_{2}Se_{3}. Our results show that Nb_{2}Se_{3} is in the intermediate to large coupling limit of BCS theory with a possible large mean-squared anisotropy of the energy gap on the Fermi surface.

More microscopic measurements such as NMR, neutron scattering, and tunneling experiments would be very useful to quantify the question of possible filamentary superconductivity above bulk T_{C} or multiband features. We conclude that the Nb_{2}Se_{3} is a promising model system to study superconducting properties in quasi-one-dimensional metallic chain systems.

Figures 1(b) and 1(c) show the temperature dependence of the resistivity after subtracting the residual resistivity that has been estimated by the extrapolation of the p_{P} and p_{N} curves to T=0.

The clustering of atoms in chains results in the quasi-one-dimensional conduction band model first proposed by Kamimura on the example of (SN)_{x}. [13, 21] It was shown that electron-electron Umklapp scattering dominates the electronic transport, whereas electron-phonon and electron-electron normal scattering are negligible. [22] The temperature dependence of the resistivity is given by the power law \rho-\rho_{0}=CT^{n} (C=const.). For k_{B}T\leqslant(0.1-0.3)\gamma, where \gamma is the interchain interaction energy, n takes values of 2 \leqslant n \leqslant 3, and for k_{B}T>\mid\gamma, n=1. The power law fit of both \rho_{P} and \rho_{N} in Fig. 2(b) is possible below T=15 K whereas a linear temperature dependence is observed above T=250 K. The resistivity for I\uparrow\uparrowb axis takes the form \rho=\rho_{0}+CT^{n} with n =2.1\pm0.1, C=(1.40\pm 0.02)10^{-8}\Omega cm/K^{n}, and resistivity for I\perpb axis has the same temperature dependence with n =2.07\pm0.04, C=(7.1\pm 0.7)10^{-8}\Omega cm/K^{n}.

Low temperature thermodynamic, magnetic, and transport properties are shown in Fig. 3. The jump \Delta ct T=2.0 K in the specific heat and 25% of unsaturated -1/4 \pi value in M/H data at the lowest temperature of our measurement (1.8 K) suggest a bulk superconducting transition in Nb_{2}Se_{3}. Electrical transport measurements show a somewhat higher transition temperature. For current applied along the chains as well as perpendicular to chains (b axis) the onset of the superconducting transition is at T_{\rho}^{onset}=2.4 K. At T=2.2 K the transition to the superconducting state for the b-axis (p_{P}

 resistivity is complete whereas resistivity for I \perp _b_-axis (\rho_{N}) shows a structure and the change of slope. Finally, at bulk _T__{C}=2.0 K, \rho_{N} is fully superconducting. Magnetic susceptibility _M_/_H_ is diamagnetic already at T_{o}^{onset} and its magnitude grows towards bulk superconductivity below _T__{C}=2.0 K. By fitting the temperature dependence of the specific heat in the normal state using C = \gamma T+ \beta T^{3}, we obtain _C_/_T_ = \gamma =9.96 +- 0.2 mJ/mol k^{2} and \theta_{D}=223 +- 3 K using the relation \theta_{D}^{3}= (12/5) (\pi^{2}nR/\beta), where R is the gas constant and n is the number of atoms per molecule.

Figure 4 presents temperature-dependent electrical resistivity data for Nb2Se3 taken at a variety of applied fields for H <= 12 kOe for field applied parallel and perpendicular to Nb chains and for the current running parallel and perpendicular to Nb chains. Two features are evident: there is a suppression of the superconducting phase to lower temperatures for increasing applied field, and there is a negligible magnetoresistivity in the normal state. The decrease of _T__{C} for I \uparrow \uparrow b axis tracks the data well for I \perp b axis for a fixed field direction. On the other hand, suppression of superconductivity is much stronger for H \perp b axis (Nb chains) than for a field applied along the b axis (parallel to Nb chains). A closer look at the temperature dependent resistivity for I \perp b axis reveals a step in the superconducting transition that persists up to 1 kOe. Using these data, _H__{c2}(_T_) curve can be deduced (Fig. 5). We notice an almost linear temperature dependence and relatively large anisotropy of the _H__{c2}(_T_) curve for a magnetic field applied parallel and perpendicular to the Nb chains. There is no sign of saturation down to the lowest temperature of our measurement, 0.4 K.

By extrapolating _H__{c2}(_T_) data to _T_=0 we get values of _H__{c2}(0)=7.5 kOe (_H_ \perp Nb chains) and _H__{c2}(0)=14 kOe (_H_ \uparrow \uparrow Nb chains), which is significantly larger. Taken as a whole, the temperature dependence of _H__{c2} for Nb2Se3 is similar to that found for other quasi-one-dimensional superconductors, for example TaSe3, Nb3Se4, and Nb3S4. By using _B__{C2}(_T_)=[\Phi 0/2\pi\xi(_T_)] we obtain coherence lengths \xi(0)=203 \AA and \xi(0)=153 \AA for a field applied perpendicular and parallel to Nb chains, respectively, a bit shorter than in Nb metal \xi(0)=380 \AA.

## V Discussion

Electronic transport in the normal state can be understood in the framework of the theory of Oshiyama and Kamimura.[22] However, our results imply that electron-electron Umklapp scattering is dominant not only along the chain axis of a quasi-one-dimensional metal but also perpendicular to it. The linear resistivity above 250 K and a \rho\sim_T_^{2.1} temperature dependence of resistivity for both \rho_{P} and \rho_{N} below _T_=15 K, are consistent with the possible range of the chain interaction energy 45 K <= \gamma <= 150 K. We note that the power law temperature dependence of resistivity in vapor transport grown crystals extends up to 40 K, implying a larger value of \gamma than what we obtained in our work on flux grown crystals. The difference could arise due to the presence of other scattering mechanisms besides electron-electron Umklapp scattering. Alternatively, this may imply that the interchain interaction energy is sensitive to crystalline disorder and imperfections. The flux grown crystals have a higher residual resistivity value \rho_{0}=26 \mu\Omega cm for the current applied parallel to Nb chains along the b axis of the crystal compared to crystals grown by vapor transport reaction where \rho_{0}=0.5 \mu\Omega cm.[13]

We turn now to the properties of the superconducting state. Using McMillan's expression[23]

  \[T_{C}=\frac{\Theta_{D}}{1.45}\exp\left\{-\frac{1.04(1+\lambda)}{\lambda-\mu^{*}(1+0 .62\lambda)}\right\}\] (1)

and the value of the Debye temperature from the heat capacity analysis \theta_{D}=223 K, we estimate the value of the electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda = 1.05 assuming the empirical value of pseudopotential \mu^{*} = 0.1. These results put Nb_{2}Se_{3} in the class of the intermediate to strong coupling superconductors. The specific-heat jump \Delta C/(\gamma T_{C}) = 0.5 (Fig. 3) is substantially smaller than the mean-field BCS value of 1.43.[24] in the weak-coupling superconductors, the reduced specific heat jump can be interpreted in the terms of the energy gap anisotropy. The effects of an anisotropic energy gap on the thermodynamic properties of the BCS superconductors have been calculated in the seminal work of John Clemm:

\[\Delta C/(\gamma T_{C})=1.426(1-4\langle a^{2}\rangle),\] (2)

where \langle a^{2}\rangle, the mean-squared anisotropy, is the average over the Fermi surface of the square of the deviation of the energy-gap parameter from its average.[25] Strong coupling effects and anisotropy in general tend to work in opposite direction and the specific heat jump would be enhanced by strong coupling. This would imply a rather strong anisotropy of the superconducting gap in Nb_{2}Se_{3}. Equation (2) therefore gives a rather conservative estimate of \langle a^{2}\rangle = 0.16. Table 1 compares the value of electron phonon coupling parameter and the gap anisotropy for several anisotropic superconductors.

Nb_{2}Se_{3} exhibits zero resistivity for current applied along the b axis of the crystal, parallel to Nb chains (\rho_{p}) at T = 2.2 K, whereas the onset of this transition and the transition to a diamagnetic M/H is at T_{\rho}^{onset}=2.4 K. However, the heat capacity shows a transition to a bulk superconducting state at bulk T_{C}=2.0 K, where magnetic susceptibility data for M/H shows a dive towards full Meissner effect. These results suggest that the superconductivity of Nb_{2}Se_{3} is a bulk effect below T_{C} \sim 2.0 K and filamentary in nature between T_{\rho}^{onset} and T_{C}. Nb_{2}Se_{3} can be regarded as an aggregate of one-dimensional chains that are weakly coupled through Josephson-type junctions since the distance between the Nb atoms in a chain is metallic but the interchain distance exceeds the metallic distance. The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity for current I \perp b axis (\rho_{N} is perpendicular to Nb chains) is consistent with this interpretation. The onset temperature T_{\rho}^{onset} is the same for both \rho_{p} and \rho_{N}, however \rho_{N} shows zero resistivity only at bulk T_{C} and a feature indicating another superconducting transition at T=2.2 K that is visible in applied magnetic field up to 1 kOe. An alternative explanation for this is a small misorientation in the current direction during electrical transport measurement perpendicular to the Nb chains. However, that would imply the presence of two T_{C}'s in two different electronic substructures and negligible interband scattering.[26]

## VI VI Conclusion

In summary, we have showed bulk superconductivity and have investigated the anisotropy in electrical transport properties in the normal and in the superconducting state of Nb_{2}Se_{3}. Our results show that Nb_{2}Se_{3} is in the intermediate to large coupling limit of BCS theory with a possible large mean-squared anisotropy of the energy gap on the Fermi surface.

More microscopic measurements such as NMR, neutron scattering, and tunneling experiments would be very useful to quantify the question of possible filamentary superconductivity above bulk T_{C} or multiband features. We conclude that the Nb_{2}Se_{3} is a promising model system to study superconducting properties in quasi-one-dimensional metallic chain systems.
