###### Abstract

Large high-quality single crystals of hole-doped iron-based
superconductor (Ba1-_x_K_x_)Fe2As2 were grown over a broad composition
range 0.22 <= x <= 1 by inverted temperature gradient method. We found
that high soaking temperature, fast cooling rate, and an adjusted
temperature window of the growth are necessary to obtain single crystals
of heavily K-doped crystals (0.65 <= x <= 0.92) with narrow
compositional distributions as revealed by sharp superconducting
transitions in magnetization measurements and close to 100

## 1 Introduction

Superconductivity in (Ba1-_x_K_x_)Fe2As2 (BaK122 in the following) with
transition temperature T_(c) as high as 38 K was found by Rotter _et
al_. [1] very soon after discovery of high-temperature superconductivity
in LaFeAs(O,F) by Hosono group [2]. It was found later that
superconductivity in BaFe2As2 can be also induced by electron doping on
partial substitution of Fe atoms with aliovalent Co [3] and Ni [4], by
isovalent substitution of Ru atoms at Fe sites [5] and P atoms at As
sites [6], or by application of pressure [7].

In both families of compounds, the superconductivity has maximum T_(c)
close to a point where the antiferromagnetic order of the parent
compounds BaFe2As2 and LaFeAsO, respectively, is suppressed, prompting
intense discussion about the relation of superconductivity and magnetism
and potentially magnetic mechanism of superconducting pairing [8, 9, 10,
11, 12]. A characteristic feature of the scenario, suggested for
magnetically mediated superconductivity [13, 14, 15], is systematic
doping evolution of all electronic properties, in particular, of
electrical resistivity. Superconducting T_(c) has maximum at a point
where the line of the second-order magnetic transition goes to T = 0
(quantum critical point, QCP). Temperature-dependent resistivity
gradually transforms from T² expected in Fermi liquid theory of a metal
away from QCP to T linear at the QCP. In the transformation range, ρ(T)
can be described with a second-order polynomial, with the magnitude of
T-linear term scaling with superconducting T_(c)[12]. In iron-based
superconductors, this scenario works very well in isoelectron doped
BaP122 [16, 17, 18]. Here maximum T_(c) is indeed observed at x = 0.33,
close to doping-tuned magnetic QCP, and signatures of QCP are found in
both normal [16, 17, 18] and superconducting [19] states, with
resistivity at optimal doping being T linear for both in-plane [16] and
interplane [20] transport. Deviations from this scenario are not very
pronounced in electron-doped BaCo122. Here, maximum T_(c) is observed
close to a composition where T_(N)(x) extrapolates to zero, though the
actual line shows slope sign change on approaching T = 0 and reentrance
of the tetragonal phase [21]. The temperature-dependent in-plane
resistivity is close to T linear at optimal doping and transforms to T²
in the overdoped regime, while the interplane resistivity shows limited
range of T-linear dependence, terminated at high temperature by a broad
crossover [22, 23, 24, 25] due to pseudogap. The resistivity anisotropy
γ_(ρ) ≡ ρ_(c)/ρ_(a) scales with the anisotropy of the upper critical
field γ_(H) ≡ H_(c2, ab)/H_(c2, c)[22] with γ_(ρ) = γ_(H)². The γ_(H)(x)
changes steplike between underdoped and overdoped regions of the dome
[26, 27], due to Fermi surface topology change (Lifshits transition)
[28].

Contrary to the cases of isoelectron substitution and electron doping,
no systematic studies of the temperature-dependent resistivity and
anisotropic properties of hole-doped BaK122 system were reported so far.
Studies were performed in the underdoped, x < 0.4 [29, 30] compositions,
for which high-quality single crystals can be grown from FeAs flux [31],
or in heavily overdoped range x > 0.76 [32], where crystals were
prepared from KAs flux [33]. Crystals of BaK122 can be also grown from
Sn flux [34], however, their properties are notably affected by Sn
inclusions at sub-percent level and will not be discussed here.

In BaK122, the superconductivity appears on sufficient suppression of
antiferromagnetic order, for x >  ≈ 0.15, while magnetism is completely
suppressed by x ≈ 0.25[35, 36], revealing a range of bulk coexistence.
The doping edge of magnetism corresponds to T_(c) ∼ 27 K [30], notably
lower that the highest T_(c) ≈ 38 K observed at optimal doping x≈0.4,
away from concentration boundary of magnetism suppression. The T_(c)(x)
dependence for x in the range 0.4 to 0.6 is nearly flat [37]. The
superconductivity is observed in the whole substitution range up to
x = 1 with steady decrease of T_(c) down to 3.7 K in the end member
KFe₂As₂ (x = 1).

Broad crossover in the temperature-dependent resistivity is observed in
in-plane transport in single crystals of BaK122 at doping close to
optimal [38], similar to pure stoichiometric KFe₂As₂ (K122) [39, 40, 41,
42, 43]. Explanation of the crossover was suggested as arising from
multi-band effects [38], with contribution of two conductivity channels,
as found in optical studies [44] with nearly temperature-independent and
strongly temperature dependent resistivities, respectively. The maximum
in ρ_(a)(T) of BaK122 was discussed by Gasparov _et al_. [45] as arising
from phonon-assisted scattering between two Fermi-surface sheets.

The information about the doping-evolution of the upper critical field
in hole-doped BaK122 is scattered. Very high upper critical fields were
reported for close to optimally doped compositions [45, 46, 47], in
addition, these compositions are characterized by rather small critical
field anisotropy. In another doping regime, close to x = 1, very unusual
behavior of the upper critical fields is found. In KFe₂As₂, the orbital
H_(c2) found in H ∥ c configuration, is close to T linear [40]. The
slope of the dependence does not depend on T_(c) suppression with
impurities [43]. In configuration with magnetic field parallel to the
plane, H ∥ ab, the upper critical field is Pauli limited, as suggested
both by the difference in the shape of the phase diagram and quite sharp
changes at H_(c2)[48]. Heat capacity study in H ∥ a configuration,
however, had not found first order transition [49], but rather suggested
multiband Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO [50, 51]) state [52]. In
slightly less doped material with x = 0.93, (T_(c) ∼ 8 K) hysteresis is
observed in the field-tuned resistive transition curves in H ∥ ab
configuration at temperatures below 1 K, which can be attributed to a
first-order superconducting transition due to paramagnetic effect [53].
More systematic studies of the anisotropic H_(c2) in BaK122 system are
desperately required.

In this study, we report growth of high-quality single crystals of
(Ba_(1 − x)K_(x))Fe₂As₂ for all doping ranges (0.22 ≤ x ≤ 1) and report
systematic study of their temperature-dependent resistivity and
anisotropic upper critical fields. We found nearly doping independent
resistivity value at high temperatures, which is in notable contrast to
electron-doped BaCo122 [24] and isoelectron substituted BaP122 [16]
materials. We found systematic evolution of the temperature dependent
resistivity with doping and rapid decrease of residual resistivity
towards x = 1. We also found that the slopes dH_(c2)/dT are proportional
to T_(c) for both H ∥ c and H ∥ ab configurations. The anisotropy
γ ≡ H_(c2, ab)/H_(c2, c), increases from 2 to 4-5 with increasing K
doping level. The doping dependence of anisotropy ratio might be linked
with change of the topology of the Fermi surface and the evolution of
the superconducting gap.

## II Experimental

### Crystal growth

We have previously described successful growth of high-quality single
crystals of stoichiometric KFe₂As₂ at T = 1157 K using KAs flux [43].
One of the key elements of the growth technique was using a liquid-Sn
sealing of alumina crucibles to suppress the evaporation of K and As.
This technique allowed us to avoid use of quartz tubes in direct contact
with K vapor and use of expensive sealed tantalum tubes. Analysis of the
growth morphology in the case of KFe₂As₂[43] lead us to conclude that
the crystals nucleate on the surface of the melt and grow by the
reaction on the top surface of the crystal with K and As in the vapor
phase. We were able to promote this reaction by developing an
inverted-temperature-gradient method with the colder zone at the top of
the crucible, as shown in Fig. 1(a). A temperature gap of 20 K was set
between the top zone and the bottom zone. This method yielded
higher-quality crystals of KFe₂As₂ (as characterized by the residual
resistivity ratio of up to 3000), than obtained in traditional flux
method, as crystallization from the liquid top can expel impurity phases
into the liquid during crystal growth.

This method works very well for the growth of heavily K-doped
(Ba_(1 − x)K_(x))Fe₂As₂ single crystals. Small amount of Ba was added to
the load with the ratio Ba:K:Fe:As=y:5:2:6 (y = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) in
the stating materials. The chemicals were weighed and loaded into an
alumina crucible in a glove box under argon atmosphere. Because of use
of higher soaking temperatures leading to higher vapor pressures Sn seal
technique was not reliable enough, and we switched to tantalum tube
sealing. The alumina crucibles were then

were grown in a vertical two-zone tube furnace, in which the temperature
of the top zone during the growth was set 20 K lower than the
temperature of the bottom zone. (b) Photograph of the as-grown single

in-plane dimensions up to 18×10 mm². The reflection of the camera can be

sealed in a tantalum tube by arc welding. In Table 1, we show the growth
conditions of Ba1-_x_KxFe2As2 single crystals. We started to grow
heavily K-doped crystals by following the same procedure that worked
well for the crystal growth of KFe2As2. For y = 0.1, we obtained single
crystals with K doping level at around x = 0.90 using soaking
temperature of 1193 K. The actual compositions of the crystals were
determined by wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDS)
electron-probe microanalysis. For y = 0.2 and 0.3, the single crystals
obtained by cooling down from the soaking temperature of T = 1193 K
display broad transitions, which suggests inhomogeneity of Ba and K
distributions in the sample. We were able to improve sample quality by
adjusting the composition of the starting load material and soaking
temperatures, as shown in Table 1. We found that increase of the soaking
temperature to T = 1273 K helps growth of the samples with x = 0.8 and
0.9 with sharp superconducting transitions. The further increase of the
soaking temperature up to 1323 K, leads to growth of the crystals
showing multiple steps at the superconducting transition due to
inhomogeneous K distribution. We found that higher soaking temperatures
1273 K  ≤ T ≤ 1323 K and narrowed temperature window for crystal growth
are similarly useful to grow the crystals within the doping range
0.6 < x < 0.9 with sharp superconducting transition.

For the samples with K doping levels below x = 0.55, we turned to the
FeAs flux method. The growth conditions can be found in Table 1. For the
crystals within the optimal doping range (0.3 < x < 0.5), the growth
using conditions as shown in Table 1 yielded large and high-quality
crystals with sharp transitions. Interestingly, to grow high-quality
underdoped crystals, a further increase of the soaking temperature to
1453 K and fast cooling rate of 2 K/h are needed. A series of large and
high-quality (Ba1-_x_Kx)Fe2As2 single crystals (0.22 ≤ x ≤ 1) with sizes
up to 18 × 10 × 1 mm³, as shown in Fig. 1(b) for x = 0.39 and Fig. 1(c)
for x = 0.92. In fact, the size of Ba1-_x_KxFe2As2 single crystals was
only limited by the size of alumina crucibles used.

### Sample characterization

XRD measurements were performed on a PANalytical MPD diffractometer
using Co Kα radiation. The Kα2 radiation was removed with X’pert
Highscore software. All BaK122 crystals are readily cleaved along the ab
plane, as shown in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c). The XRD patterns of BaK122
single crystals with 0.22 ≤ x ≤ 1 are shown in Fig. 2. The traces of
impurity phases close to the baseline are indicated by the asterisks,
they are most likely caused by the flux inclusions. Figure 2(b) shows
systematic shift of the (008) peak towards the lower angles with
increasing K content. The c-axis lattice parameter is estimated based on
the (00l) diffractions and displayed as a function of K content in Fig.
2(c); it changes linearly with x and its values match well the results
on polycrystalline samples [37].

Magnetic susceptibility χ(T) was measured using PPMS Vibrating Sample
Magnetometer (PPMS VSM, Quantum Design). Typical size of the single
crystals used in magnetization measurements was 4 × 3 × 0.2 mm³, and
their mass was ∼10 mg. In-plane resistivity ρ_(a) was measured in
four-probe configuration using Physical Property Measurement System
(PPMS, Quantum Design). Samples were cleaved into bars with typical
dimensions (1-2)×(0.3-0.5)×(0.02-0.05) mm³. Electrical contacts were
made by soldering Ag wires using pure tin [54, 55] and had contact
resistance typically in several μΩ range. Sample dimensions were
measured using optical microscope with the accuracy of about 10

magnetic susceptibility curves show high quality of crystals with
x = 0.34, 0.39, 0.47, 0.53, 0.55, and 1. The transition width ΔT_(c) was
defined using 90

Using T_(c) from magnetic susceptibility data of top panel of Fig. 3 and
x values as obtained in WDS analysis, we constructed the doping phase
diagram, as shown in bottom panel of Fig. 3. For reference, we show the
diagram as determined from measurements on high-quality polycrystalline
materials [35-37]. The two studies are in good agreement.

We do not see any indications of the phase separation in our underdoped
samples x = 0.22. Previous study of underdoped BaK122 samples grown from
Sn flux with x = 0.28 found regions of antiferromagnetically (AF)
ordered phase with size of 65 nm coexisting with nonmagnetic
superconducting regions [56]. Later study using three-dimensional (3D)
atom probe tomography revealed that the separation is caused by
inhomogeneous distributions of Ba and K elements [57], with a tendency
for Ba and K atoms to form clusters. Thus we conclude that this problem
is not characteristic of the growth technique we use.

We do see, however, that strong inhomogeneity occurs during crystal
growth of overdoped crystals (0.65 < x < 0.8). There is no intrinsic
phase separation revealed for polycrystalline samples in this doping
range. In our samples, we do not see macroscopic inhomogeneity in WDS
measurements with spatial resolution of about 1 μm. On the other hand,
phase separation on a finer scale was found in two STM studies. Imaging
of vortex lattice in single crystals of optimally doped BaK122
x = 0.40[58] found regular lattice, but a short-range order (vortex
glass phase) in single crystals of SrK122 x = 0.25[59]. Song _et al._
suggested that mismatch between the size of the dopant K atom and of the
host atoms Ba and Sr, Ba²⁺/ K⁺ and Sr²⁺/ K⁺, respectively, causes dopant
clustering and electronic inhomogeneity [59]. This idea, however, does
not provide any explanation why the distribution is more homogeneous for
samples close to optimal doping, whereas dopant clustering becomes
serious within the doping range 0.65 ≤ x ≤ 0.8. From the perspective of
the crystal growth, high growth rates should be helpful to suppress
segregation, and higher soaking temperatures should help to mix the
dopant in the liquid melt. Because of this segregation

problem, it is important to optimize growth conditions for overdoped
single crystals. Finally, we would like to point out that in our
high-quality (Ba_(1 − x)K_(x))Fe₂As₂ single crystals, c lattice
parameter monotonically increases with increasing K doping level, which
suggests that the evolution of lattice parameters is not affected by
possible clustering.

## III Results and discussion

### Doping evolution of the temperature-dependent resistivity

Temperature dependent in-plane resistivity ρ(T) of the samples with
x = 0.22 to 1.0 is shown in Fig. 4. The data are presented using
normalized ρ(T)/ρ(300 K) plots and offset to avoid overlapping. The
doping evolution of the actual resistivity values ρ(300 K) shows
significant scatter due to uncertainty of the geometric factors, which
are strongly affected by hidden cracks in micacious crystals of iron
pnictides [22,26]. Of note though that within statistical error, the
resistivity ρ(300 K) remains constant over the whole compositional range
from heavily underdoped samples with x = 0.22 to heavily overdoped
x = 1.0, which is distinctly different from electron doped BaCo122
[24,60] and isoelectron substituted BaP122 [16], in which ρ(300 K)
decreases notably with doping. The first look at the
temperature-dependent resistivity also does not show significant doping
evolution. For all doping levels the ρ(T) curves show a broad crossover
starting above 100 K and ending at around 200 K. The onset of this
feature most clearly reveals itself as a maximum in the
temperature-dependent resistivity derivative, see Fig. 5. The origin of
the feature was discussed in terms of multi-band character of
conductivity in which one of the bands has strongly temperature
dependent contribution, while the other has nearly temperature
independent conductivity [38], as contribution from phonon-assisted
scattering between two Fermi-surface sheets [45] and as a feature
associated with pseudogap, as suggested by its correlation with the
maximum of the interplane transport ρ_(c)(T) in underdoped compositions
[24,25,30]. The position of the crossover does not change with doping,
and since the Fermi surface topology reveals quite significant changes
[61], the explanation of the maximum in term of special features of band
structure [38,45] is very unlikely.

At temperatures lower than 100 K, however, temperature-dependent
resistivity shows some evolution. Because of high temperature of the
superconducting transition, we cannot make correct analysis of the
functional form of ρ(T) in the T → 0 limit over the whole dome. However,
for the sake of comparison, we fitted the curves in a narrow range from
40 to 60 K, which was fixed for all compositions. These fits were done
two ways. The first approach was using second order polynomial function,
ρ(T)/ρ(300 K) = α₀ + α₁T + α₂T², similar to the fit used by
Doiron-Leyraud _et al._[62] for electron-doped BaCo122. In the top panel
of Fig. 6, we show the fits over the range 40 to 60 K for ρ(T) curves
for representative doping levels, three bottom panels show doping
evolution of the fit parameters α₀, α₁, and α₂. This analysis reveals
clearly that the dependence has highest linear contribution at x = 0.35
and 0.39, and that the T² contribution is minimum at x = 0.39,
coinciding with maximum T_(c) position but away from the doping border
of the antiferromagnetic state at x = 0.26.

The second approach was fitting the data using a power-law function,
ρ/ρ(300 K) = ρ₀ + AT^(n), as shown for selected compositions in Fig. 7.
This approach is similar to the approach used by Shen _et al._[29],
however, in their case the fitting range was extending to 80 K. For the
sake of comparison, we did power-law analysis for the temperature ranges
40 to 70 K and 40 to 80 K, and from above T_(c) to 60 K. The results of
these

overlapping.

fittings are shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 7. It can be seen that
all ways of analysis find largest deviations from Fermi-liquid T²
dependence at x = 0.39, which corresponds to a leading edge of maximum
T_(c) plateau of the T_(c)(x) dome. Since T_(c)(x) function is nearly
flat in 0.34 to 0.56 range, while both T-linear contribution in the
polynomial analysis, Fig. 6(c), and power-law exponent n peak at
x = 0.39, we conclude that T_(c) and the amplitude of T-linear
contribution do not scale in BaK122, contrary to BaCo122 [12]. Another
interesting point is that exponent n, we observe in sample x = 0.39 is
close to 1.5. This is notably higher than the lowest exponent n = 1.1
found in previous study [29]. To further check the link between T-linear
contribution and maximum T_(c), further studies in high magnetic fields
may be necessary.

An interesting feature of these fits is that the residual resistivity
takes negative values for most of the compositions. This fact is
suggestive that at lower temperatures the ρ(T) curves should develop
significant positive curvature, as is in fact observed for heavier doped
compositions, in which broader temperature range can be studied. It also
suggests that most of our samples have quite high residual resistivity
ratio in T → 0 limit.

On the other hand, the T² coefficient as determined from the polynomial
fit for the range 40 to 60 K gradually increases towards x = 1. Since
T_(c) drops significantly in this range, we are able to make an analysis
at lower temperatures. In Fig. 8, we plot ρ(T) data for all samples
using a T² plot, bottom panel shows expanded view for heavily overdoped
samples. When plotted this way, the plots become linear right above
T_(c), and the slopes of the curves do not show any noticeable doping
evolution beyond error bars. This observation suggests that for all
doping levels there is significant and noncritical T² contribution, and
indeed several contributions to conductivity are needed for correct
account of its doping evolution.

### Anisotropic upper critical fields

The anisotropy of the upper critical field
$\gamma_{H}\equiv\frac{H_{c,hh}}{H_{c,x}}$ presents important
information about the anisotropy of the electrical resistivity,
$\gamma_{\rho}\equiv\frac{\rho_{c}}{\rho_{H}}$. In a temperature range,
close to zero-field T_(c), the anisotropy of H_(c, 2) for s-wave
superconductors in the clean limit can be written as
γ_(H)² = ⟨v_(a)²⟩/⟨v_(c)²⟩[63], or roughly γ_(H) ∼ v_(a)/v_(c), where
v_(a) and v_(c) are Fermi velocities for a and c directions,
respectively. Assuming that the mean-free path is isotropic, the
anisotropy of resistivity
ρ_(c)/ρ_(a) = σ_(a)/σ_(c) ∼ N_(a)D_(a)/N_(c)D_(c), where Ns are
densities of states and Ds are diffusivities, which are both
proportional to v. Hence γ_(ρ) = ρ_(c)/ρ_(a) = (v_(a)/v_(c))², and
γ_(H)² ∼ γ_(H). In the dirty limit near T_(c),
$H_{c,2}\sim 1/\xi_{\rm dirty}^{2}\sim 1/D\sim 1/v$ and again
γ_(H) ∼ v_(a)/v_(c), unless the scattering itself is anisotropic. Hence,
we again have

(blue down-triangles) and T_(c) to 60 K (magenta open circles).

offset to avoid overlapping. Three panels at the bottom show doping
evolution of the fit parameters α₀ (b), α₁ (c), and α₂ (d).

γ_(H)² ∼ γ_(ρ). Although approximate, this relation was verified
semi-quantitatively in the optimally doped BaCo122 [22] and in
KFe₂As₂[40]. The angular dependent H_(c2)(Θ) was also studied
systematically in BaK122 with x = 0.92[53], in which the authors found
strong deviations from cos(Θ) dependence expected in the orbital limit
[64]. Scattered in x measurements of γ_(H) were undertaken on samples
close to optimal doping grown from Sn flux [34, 45, 46, 65] and from
FeAs flux [47, 66]. Here, we study evolution of the γ_(H)(x) in BaK122
from resistive H_(c2) measurements.

In Fig. 9, we show zoom of the ρ(T) curve in the vicinity of the
superconducting transition in sample with x = 0.39. Here, we show how we
defined different criteria used to determine T_(c)(H) dependence. We
analyzed resistivity data by linear extrapolation of ρ(T) curves at the
transition and above the transition. The onset $T_{c,\rm onset}$ of the
transition is defined at the crossing point of these linear fits. The
offset T_(c) corresponds to the crossing point of the steep transition
line with ρ = 0 line.

In Fig. 10, we show resistivity data taken in magnetic fields parallel
to c axis (top panels), parallel to the conducting ab plane (middle
panels) and temperature dependent H_(c2)(T) for two field orientations
determined using onset and offset criteria. The data are shown for
BaK122 compositions with x = 0.22 (a), 0.34 (b), 0.39 (c), and 0.47 (d).
Similar data for slightly to moderately overdoped compositions x = 0.53
(a), 0.55 (b), 0.65 (c), 0.80 (d) are shown in Fig. 11, and for strongly
overdoped compositions x = 0.82 (a), 0.90 (b), 0.92 (c), and 1.0 (d) in
Fig. 12.

For the samples with x = 0.22, 0.34, 0.39, 0.47, 0.53, and 0.55, the
H_(c2)(T) curves show positive curvature close to T_(c)(0) for lowest
fields below H = 1 T. Going further below T_(c)(0), the H_(c2)(T) gets
practically T linear. This is exactly the range which we use for
determination of the dH_(c2)/dT slope and evaluation of H_(c2)(0) as
H_(c2)(0) = −0.70T_(c)(0)dH_(c2)/dT (as shown in Fig. 13). For the
heavily overdoped samples x = 0.80, 0.82, 0.90, 0.92, and 1, the
H_(c2)(T) curves in configuration H ∥ ab show a clear decrease of slope
on cooling with a tendency to saturation, whereas for H ∥ c the curves
remain linear. Therefore the linear fit only can be applied to the data
close to T_(c), as shown in the bottom panels of Fig. 12. The saturation
in H ∥ ab reflects paramagnetic Pauli limiting [67]. Similar saturation
behavior is seen in underdoped samples [46].

In Fig. 13(b), we summarize the doping evolution of the slope of the
temperature dependent upper critical field for field orientations along
c axis (open black circles) and along the plane (closed red circles)
(middle panel). In the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory [68] of
the upper critical field for the orbital limiting mechanism,
H_(c2)(0) = −0.7T_(c)(0)dH_(c2)/dT. In Fig. 13(c), we plot H_(c2)(0)
estimated using WHH formula as −0.7T_(c)(0)dH_(c2)/dT. Note the huge
values of H_(c2, c)>100 T for compositions close to optimal doping.
Interesting, the H_(c2, c)(x) and especially H_(c2, ab)(x) dependencies
peak at 0.39 and are much sharper than T_(c)(x) dependence.

### Doping evolution of the anisotropy parameter γ

In the bottom panel of Fig. 13, we plot doping evolution of the
anisotropy of the upper critical field γ(x). It can be seen that γ
increases approximately two times, from 2 to 4 to

temperatures.

ρ(T) in the normal state above T_(c) and at the sharp transition slope.

transition slope to zero resistance.

5 (depending on criterion) with increasing K doping levels. The increase
starts in the heavily overdoped compositions x > 0.82, not far from the
point where the Fermi surface topology change was found in
angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) studies [61] and where
the magnetism of the compounds changes according to neutron scattering
[69, 70] and NMR [71] studies. According to ARPES studies, the electron
sheet of the Fermi surface transforms to four tiny cylinders. Since
electron sheets are most warped [22], it is natural to expect an
anisotropy increase close to x = 1 end of the doping phase diagram, in
line with the upper critical anisotropy increase with x.

Several previous studies of _H_c2 anisotropy for selected x close to
optimal doping in BaK compounds were performed in high magnetic fields
up to 60 T in samples with _T_c = 28.2 K (_x_ = 0.4) [46], _T_c = 32 K
(_x_ = 0.45) [65], and _T_c = 38.5 K (_x_ =0.32) [45]. They found
anisotropy decreasing on cooling, which was presumably caused by
contribution of paramagnetic effect for _H_c2,_ab_.

Similar to high-field studies in single crystals of other iron-based
superconductors BaCo122 x = 0.14 [45, 72], NdFeAsO_(0.7)F_(0.3)[73],
LiFeAs [74], and FeTe_(0.6)Se_(0.4)[75, 76], we find rough linear
increase of the _H_c2,_c_(_T_), but concave dependence with a tendency
for saturation for _H_c2,_ab_. For all compounds of iron based
superconductors, the anisotropy ratio _g_’ at _T_c(0) is in the range 2
to 5, similar to our finding in BaK122, with
Ca₁₀(Pt₃As₈)((Fe_(1 − x)Pt_(x))₂As₂)₈ with x = 0.09 [77],
SmFeAsO_(0.88)F_(0.15)[78] and LaFe_(0.92)Co_(0.08)AsO [79] being
exceptions, with g 7 to 8.

Additional contribution to the doping evolution of the anisotropy of the
upper critical field can come from the evolution of the superconducting
gap structure [80]. Initial high-resolution ARPES studies on optimally
doped samples with x = 0.4 revealed a superconducting large gap (Δ∼12
meV) on the two small holelike and electronlike Fermi surface sheets,
and a small gap (∼6 meV) on the large holelike Fermi surface [81]. In
heavily overdoped KFe₂As₂, the Fermi surface around the Brillouin-zone
center is qualitatively similar to that of composition with x = 0.4, but
the two electron pockets are absent due to an excess of the hole doping
[82]. An ARPES study over a wide doping range of BaK122 discovered that
the gap size of the outer hole Fermi surface sheet around the

..., 9 T. Bottom panels show _H_c2(_T_) for two field orientations H c

squares) and offset (red circles) resistive transition criteria, see
Fig. 9.

Brillouin zone center shows an abrupt drop with overdoping (for
x ≥ 0.6), while the gaps on the inner and middle sheets roughly scale
with T_(c)[83].

### Linear relation between H_(c2)(T) slope and T_(c)

The high values of the critical fields in iron pnictides are determined
by their short coherence lengths in 1- to 3-nm range [84], due to their
high T_(c) and low Fermi velocities, v, with ξ ∼ ℏv/2πk_(B)T_(c).
Discussing the reasons for remarkable proportionality of the slopes of
dH_(c2)/dT to T_(c) for both field directions shown in Fig. 14, we
recall that in _clean_ isotropic s-wave materials,

$$H_{c2}=-\frac{\phi_{0}(1-T/T_{c})}{2\pi\xi_{0}^{2}}\,,\quad\xi_{0}\sim\frac{ \hbar v}{\Delta_{0}}\propto\frac{v}{T_{c}}\,,$$
(1)

so that the slope H_(c2)^(′) ∝ T_(c). For the dirty case, H_(c2)^(′) is
T_(c) independent; indeed,

$$H_{c2}\propto\frac{1-T/T_{c}}{\xi_{0}\ell}\,,$$
(2)

where ℓ is the T independent mean-free path.

We should mention that a strong pair breaking could be another reason
for dH_(c2)/dT ∝ T_(c). For a gapless uniaxial material, the slope of
the upper critical field along the c direction near T_(c) is given by
[85]

$$\frac{dH_{c2,c}}{dT}=-\frac{4\pi\phi_{0}k_{B}^{2}}{3\hbar^{2}(\Omega^{2}v_{ab} ^{2})}\ T_{c}\,.$$
(3)

Here, Ω(k_(f)) describes the anisotropy of the order parameter and is
assumed to have a zero Fermi surface average, ⟨Ω⟩ = 0, which is the case
for the d-wave or, approximately, for the s^(±) symmetry.

In our view, the first reason, i.e., the long mean free path, is a
probable cause for dH_(c2)/dT ∝ T_(c). Studies of thermal conductivity
[86] and London penetration depth [87] at optimal doping suggest full
gap, which is inconsistent with the idea of gapless superconductivity.
In Fig. 14, we verify linear relation for BaK122 over a broad doping
(and as a consequence T_(c)) range, using onset (a) and offset (b)
criteria. The relation indeed holds very well, especially for H ∥ c
configuration where the H_(c2, 0)(x) curves extrapolate to zero on
T_(c) → 0. This suggests that there is no gross change in the Fermi
velocity over the whole doping range. The linear relation between the
slope

(b), 0.65 (c), and 0.80 (d) in magnetic fields H ∥ c (top panels) and
H ∥ ab (middle panel) with magnetic fields (right to left) 0, 0.5, 1, 2,
3, …, 9 T. Bottom panels show H_(c2)(T) for two field orientations H ∥ c
(solid symbols) and H ∥ ab (open symbols) as determined using onset
(black squares) and offset (red circles) resistive transition criteria,

of the H_(c2) line and T_(c) is grossly violated in KFe₂As₂ when T_(c)
is controlled by disorder: here the slope was found to be independent of
T_(c)[43], despite the sample being clearly in the clean limit. For
H ∥ ab, the H_(c2, 0)(x) curve is also close to linear, but does not
extrapolate to zero on T_(c) → 0. This deviation may be suggestive that
Fermi velocity for transport along the c axis is strongly decreasing in
BaK compositions with lowest T_(c) close to x = 1.

Another way to check the linear relation between the slope of the upper
critical field and T_(c) is to plot their ratio, as shown in the bottom
panel (c) of Fig. 14. Plotting data this way reveals one difficult to
recognize feature. The data for H ∥ c indeed show constant and doping
independent ratio $\frac{dH_{c2,d}dT}{T_{c}}$. The ratio for H ∥ ab
remains constant for most of the phase diagram and then increases
rapidly for x > 0.8, showing that the increase of the anisotropy in this
range is caused by decrease of the Fermi velocity, as one would expect
for more anisotropic materials. The robustness of the linear relation
between the slope and the T_(c) suggest that BaK122 for all doping
levels can be treated in clean limit, reflecting on very short coherence
lengths and long mean free paths, as mentioned above.

## IV Conclusions

Using an inverted temperature gradient method we were able to grow large
and high-quality single crystals of (Ba_(1 − x)K_(x))Fe₂As₂ with doping
range spanning from underdoped to heavily overdoped compositions (0.22
≤x≤ 1). We show that high vapor pressure of K and As elements at the
soaking temperature is an important factor in the growth of single
crystals of BaK122. When setting the top zone as the cold zone, on
cooling the nucleation starts from the surface layer of the liquid melt.
It is also assisted by the vapor growth, because surface layer also
saturates first due to the evaporation of K and As. The crystallization
processes from the top of a liquid melt helps to expel impurity phases

during, compared to the growth inside the flux. For the whole doping
range 0.22 ≤ x ≤ 1, we harvested large crystals with in-plane size up to
18×10 mm². The crystals show very sharp superconducting transitions
(less than 1 K) in dc magnetic susceptibility measurements for the
optimal doping, 0.34 ≤ x ≤ 0.55, and extremely overdoping, 0.82 ≤ x ≤ 1,
regimes. Relatively broad transitions are observed in the samples
x = 0.65 and 0.80, due to a broader distribution of Ba and K atoms and a
tendency to K clustering in the lattice [57, 59].

In-plane electrical resistivity shows systematic evolution with doping.
It perfectly follows the T² dependence in the overdoped compositions
with a doping-independent slope over the range 0.80 to 1. Close to
optimal doping, the dependence deviates from the pure T² functional form
and can be described either as a sum of T linear and T² contributions,
similar to electron-doped materials [62], or using a power-law function
with exponent n ≈ 1.5.

The anisotropy of the upper critical field shows a rapid change in the
heavily overdoped regime, concomitant with Fermi surface reconstruction.
The slope of the H_(c2)(T) curves scales with the zero-field T_(c) of
the samples, suggesting a nearly doping-independent Fermi velocity.
