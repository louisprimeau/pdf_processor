###### Abstract

The superconductivity fluctuation contribution \(\kappa_{\rm fl}\) to the thermal conductivity of a Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{1.8}\)Ca\({}_{1.2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\gamma}\) polycrystal is extracted from precise experimental data. The crossover from two-dimensional (2D) to 3D behavior theoretically predicted by Varlamov and Livanov is well marked. The crossover temperature \(T_{\rm VL}\) and the amplitude of the fluctuation contribution lead to realistic values for the interlayer coupling energy \(J_{C}\) and the transport relaxation time \(\tau\) near \(T_{c}\).

## I Introduction

There is much work already on superconductivity fluctuation contributions to high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors (HTS's) transport properties,[1] mainly on the electrical resistivity \(\rho\) and the thermopower \(S\). There was some report on the fluctuation contribution to the thermal conductivity \(\kappa_{\rm fl}\) in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) in the early days[2] though the data scattering was rather wide.

The HTS thermal conductivity \(\kappa\) remains an interesting and controversial transport property. Most of the works on thermal conductivity are devoted to the understanding of the peak structure observed below \(T_{c}\) in various high-\(T_{c}\) materials.[3] While some authors believe that this peak is essentially due to the phonon contribution \(\kappa_{\rm ph}\) (Refs. 3-7), others try to explain this feature by considering an alternative interpretation based on an electronic model.[8, 9, 10, 11, 12] Some relevant discussion concerns the characteristic dimensionality of the system.

In this paper, we investigate precise data on the thermal conductivity of a Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{1.8}\)Ca\({}_{1.2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\gamma}\) polycrystal near the critical temperature \(T_{c}\) in order to extract the contribution of fluctuations to this transport coefficient. The experimental results can be analyzed by using the theoretical model of Varlamov and Livanov (VL).[13] These authors derived the fluctuation contribution \(\kappa_{\rm fl}\) to the thermal conductivity of high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors by considering a Lawrence-Doniach model[14] to account for the layered structure of these materials.

Our experimental data can be very well reproduced by the VL theory, and we can distinguish between two-dimensional (2D) and 3D regimes. Besides, from the temperature cross-over from 3D to 2D behavior and the amplitude of the fluctuation contribution, we estimate realistic values for the interlayer coupling energy \(J_{c}\) and the transport relaxation time \(\tau\) in this anisotropic material.

The theoretical results of Varlamov and Livanov[13] are recalled in Sec. II. The sample preparation and experimental technique to measure the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity are presented in Sec. III. In Sec. IV, the experimental data are analyzed and discussed within the VL theory. Conclusions are finally drawn in Sec. V.

## II Theoretical model

The expression of the fluctuation contribution \(\kappa_{\rm fl}\) to the thermal conductivity of layered HTS materials was calculated by Varlamov and Livanov.[13] This contribution is given by

\[\frac{\kappa_{\rm fl}}{\kappa_{n}} = \frac{9\,\pi^{5}}{128[\,7\,\xi(3)\,]^{2}}\,\frac{\hbar}{\varepsilon _{F}\tau}\biggl{[}\frac{T\!-\!T_{c}}{T_{c}}\biggl{(}\frac{T\!-\!T_{c}}{T_{c}} +\delta^{2}\biggr{)}\biggr{]}^{-1/2},\] (1)

where \(\kappa_{n}\) is the normal-state contribution to the thermal conductivity extrapolated from high temperature, \(\zeta(3)\!=\!1.202\) the Riemann \(\zeta\) function, \(\varepsilon_{F}\) the Fermi energy, \(\tau\) the transport relaxation time, and \(\delta\) is related to the interlayer coupling energy \(J_{c}\) by the expression

\[\delta = \biggl{(}\frac{7\,\zeta(3)\,J_{c}^{2}}{8\,\pi^{2}(k_{B}T_{c})^{2}} \biggr{)}^{1/2}.\] (2)

The expression given by Eq. (1) was obtained by considering a Lawrence-Doniach[14] spectrum in order to account for the anisotropic and layered structure of the high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates.

From Eq. (1), one can see that in the limiting case of two- and three-dimensional behavior the fluctuation contributions to the thermal conductivity read  \[\frac{\kappa_{\rm n}}{\kappa_{n}}{}_{\kappa}{}_{\kappa}{}_{\kappa}{}_{\kappa}{} = A\left(\begin{array}{ll}(1/\delta)\varepsilon^{-1/2}&\mbox{if}&\delta^{2} \gg\varepsilon&(3D)\\ e^{-1}&\mbox{if}&\delta^{2}\ll\varepsilon&(2D),\end{array}\right.\] (3)

where \(A{}=(9\,\pi^{5}\hbar)/(128[7\,\zeta(3)]^{2}\varepsilon_{F}\tau)\) and \(\varepsilon{}=(T-T_{c})/T_{c}{}_{\tau}

  \(\kappa_{n}(T)=3.128\pm 1.104\times 10^{-2}\)\(T\) (\(R=0.99\)).

The fluctuation contribution \(\kappa_{\rm fl}\) is obtained as usual [1, 2] by subtracting this normal (background) contribution from the total thermal conductivity \(\kappa_{\rm fl}\)= \(\kappa-\kappa_{n}\). The normalized fluctuation contribution \(\kappa_{\rm fl}/\kappa_{n}\) to the thermal conductivity of the Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{1.8}\)Ca\({}_{1.2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+y}\) sample is shown in Fig. 3 as a function of \(\varepsilon^{-1}\) where \(\varepsilon=(T-T_{c})/T_{c}\) . The critical temperature \(T_{c}=79.5\) K was estimated from the inflexion point of the thermoelectric power \(S\). From the formula of Presland _et al._, [17] this corresponds to a hole carrier excess density of \(y=0.20\) for overdoped Bi-2212-based samples. One can see from Fig. 3 that \(\kappa_{\rm fl}\) follows a 2D behavior \(\kappa_{\rm fl}/\kappa_{n}=8.13\times 10^{-4}\)\(\varepsilon^{-1}\) for \(T\)-\(T_{c}\in\) [3.3 K, 7.9 K] and that a crossover to a 3D behavior \(\kappa_{\rm fl}/\kappa_{n}=3.89\times 10^{-3}\)\(\varepsilon^{-1/2}\) occurs at the temperature \(T_{\rm VL}=82.9\) K, in very good agreement with the theoretical prediction of Varlamov and Livanov.

In Fig. 4, a blow up of the crossover region is shown. The crossover from 2D to 3D behavior is well marked on such a log-log plot. From Eq. (2) and Eq. (4), the interlayer coupling energy \(J_{c}\) in the sample is experimentally estimated to be 4.2\(\times 10^{-3}\) eV. This parameter can also be estimated by using Eq. (5). By fixing the following reasonable values of the physical parameters, \(\varepsilon_{F}=0.08\) eV, \(m_{ab}^{*}=8m_{0}\), \(d=3\) A, [18] and \(\gamma=50\), [19] we obtain the theoretical value \(J_{c}=3.68\times 10^{-3}\) eV, in quite good agreement with the value obtained above.

Next, we can derive the order of magnitude of the transport relaxation time \(\tau\) from the amplitude of the fluctuation contribution, cf. Eq. (1). Fixing the Fermi energy to be \(\varepsilon_{F}=0.08\) eV, [18] we obtain \(\tau=3.07\times 10^{-12}\) s. This relaxation time value lies in the same range of magnitude than those obtained from the analysis of low frequency surface resistance [20] and thermal conductivity data in high-\(T_{c}\) materials [7, 21] and is indicative of the clean limit case for HTS's. [22]

It should be recalled that in the report by Cohn _et al._[2] the fluctuation contribution to the thermal conductivity of a YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) single crystal was also observed, leading to an estimated interlayer coupling energy \(J_{c}\approx 5\times 10^{-3}\) eV. However, from Eq. (5) and realistic values of the physical parameters and more specifically \(\gamma^{m\approx 5}\), [23] higher theoretical value, i.e., of the order of 40\(\times 10^{-3}\) eV should be obtained for YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\). This interlayer-coupling energy leads to a crossover temperature \(T_{\rm VL}\approx 270\) K for YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\). Consequently either one should conclude that one could not observe this crossover in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) or that this temperature corresponds indeed to the spin-gap opening, and the onset of fluctuations as usually observed in such a temperature range in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\). [24]

## V V. Conclusion

In summary, we have successfully extracted the fluctuation contribution to the thermal conductivity of a BiSrCaCuO-2212 compound. Great care was taken to have numerous and reliable data. The fluctuation range is much more narrow than in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) in agreement with the effective dimensionality of such different materials--an effective dimensionality which has been extracted. The experimental data can be well explained by the theory of Varlamov and Livanov. [13] From the temperature crossover from 3D to 2D behavior, we have obtained a very realistic value of the interlayer coupling energy \(J_{c}=4.2\times 10^{-3}\) eV in this highly anisotropic material. On the other hand, the value of the transport relaxation time \(\tau\) obtained from the amplitude of the fluctuation contribution seems quite reasonable.
