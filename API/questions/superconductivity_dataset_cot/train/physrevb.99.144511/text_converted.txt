###### Abstract

We report the ac magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistance, and
x-ray diffraction measurements of PtH_(x) (_x_ ≃ 1) in diamond anvil
cells, that reveal the superconducting transition. At 30 GPa, when
PtH_(x) is in a P6₃/mmc structure, PtH_(x) exhibits the superconducting
transition at 7 K. Remarkably, the observed _Tc_ is higher than that of
powdered Pt by more than three orders of magnitude. It is suggested that
the noble metals in the periodic table of elements possibly form a
region where hydrides have higher _Tc_ than elements.

## I Introduction

Pt, a well known chemically inert noble metal, has a strong
electron-phonon (_e-p_) coupling, which is favorable for
superconductivity [1, 2, 3]. On the other hand, its mass magnetic
susceptibility 1.21 × 10⁻⁸ (m³/kg in SI units) is one of the largest
ones among the metals which do not show magnetic ordering [1, 2].
Consequently, the 5d conduction electrons of Pt show strong spin
fluctuations on short length and time scales which tend to suppress the
superconducting transition [3]. This large paramagnetic Pauli
susceptibility also enhances the effective moments of magnetic 3d
impurities (e.g., Fe, Mn, Co) because of the polarization of the
neighboring 5d conduction electrons of the host metal [4]. To the best
of our knowledge, there has been no report that bulk Pt exhibits a
superconducting transition at either ambient or high pressures. In the
quest for high-temperature superconductivity, it is natural to wonder
how we can make a new superconductor that has a superconducting
transition temperature (_Tc_) as high as possible from this noble metal.
The magnetic studies by Konig _et al._ have found that powder Pt with an
average grain size about 2 μm showed a magnetic behavior very different
from a bulk material: powder Pt shows a much weaker temperature
dependence of the dynamic susceptibility in the mK and μK region [5].
Then, the superconducting transition was observed at _Tc_ = 0.62-1.38 mK
[5]. The lattice softening and the enhanced _e-p_ coupling as a result
of a large surface-to-volume ratio have been suggested to play roles in
the superconductivity of powdered Pt [5, 6].

To manipulate the electronic states of metals, hydrogenation sometimes
is an effective means. A good example is palladium hydride (PdH_(x)). Pd
has a large mass magnetic susceptibility +6.57 × 10⁻⁸ (m³/kg in SI
units) and is paramagnetic [1]. The superconductivity of Pd has not been
detected down to 2 × 10⁻⁴ K at 1 bar [1]. When it forms a hydride
PdH_(x) which has a NaCl-type crystal structure, the s electrons
provided from H atoms occupy the 1_s_-4d bonding band and unoccupied d
band of Pd [7, 8]. This Pd 4d and H 1s electron hybridization results in
the reduction of electron density of states (_e_-DOS) at the Fermi level
(_E__(F)), hence the loss of paramagnetic susceptibility. PdH_(x)
becomes non-magnetic with hydrogen composition x = H/Pd larger than 0.62
[9, 10]. At the same time, the coupling between conduction electrons and
soft-optic-mode that is related to local hydrogen vibrations is enhanced
[7, 8]. As a result, the superconductivity of PdH_(x) appears at 1 K for
x ∼ 0.8, and the _Tc_ increases to 9 K as x increases to 1 [11, 12]. The
electronic band structures of elemental Pt and Pd share similar
features: the broad dispersion bands of the 5d and 4d electrons crossing
the _E__(F) and the large _e_-DOS at _E__(F)[13]. In PtH, hybridization
between Pt 5d and H 1_s_[7, 14] and the resulting strengthened _e-p_
coupling are anticipated [7, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Also, this hybridization
could lead to the reduction of _e_-DOS at _E__(F) and the loss of
magnetic susceptibility. Theoretical calculations have predicted _Tc_ at
a temperature of 10-25 K [7, 14, 15, 16, 17]. It is noted that the
predicted _Tc_ is suppressed to below 0.4 K when anharmonic effects,
which often have a considerable degree of importance to the physical
properties of hydrogen-rich compounds, are included in the calculation
[18]. Although Pt does not react with H₂ at ambient pressure, recent
x-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments have revealed the formation of
PtH_(x) (_x_ ∼ 1) in high-pressure H₂ above 27 GPa at room temperature
[15, 19]. This compound exhibits two phases, named PtH-1 and PtH-II
respectively, coexisting up to 42 GPa at room temperature, above which
the single phase of PtH-II exists [15, 19]. The crystal structure of
PtH-I is complicated, and P321 is suggested in which H atoms occupy
tetrahedral interstitial sites [15]. In PtH-II, Pt atoms form a
hexagonal close-packed lattice (P6₃/mmc), and H atoms are predicted to
be in the octahedral interstitial sites [15,19].

In this paper, we report the measurements of the ac-magnetic
susceptibility, electrical resistance, and XRD of PtH_(x) in diamond
anvil cells (DACs). Above 30 GPa, PtH-II exhibits a superconducting
transition. It is thought that PtH-I does not show superconductivity
above 4 K. Remarkably, the T_(c) (7 K at 30 GPa) of PtH-II is higher
than that of powdered Pt by three orders of magnitude. It is suggested
that the noble metal group in the periodic table of elements forms a
spot where their hydrides have higher T_(c) than the elements.

## II Experimental

The starting material for the synthesis of PtH_(x) is a piece of Pt foil
(Nilaco, 99.95

Figure 1: Synthesis of PtH_(x) (≃ 1). (a) XRD profiles of sample 2
before and after the synthesis of PtH_(x). The _in situ_ XRD
measurements were performed at the SPring-8/BL10XU beamline using a
monochromatic synchrotron x-ray beam (λ = 0.4145 Å). Vertical bars
indicate the diffraction peak positions of PtH-II (P6₃/mmc), Pt
($Fm\bar{3}m$), Au ($Fm\bar{3}m$, electrodes), and NaCl (CsCl-type,
thermal insulation between a diamond anvil and the sample) at 45 and 41
GPa. The smooth and broad backgrounds in the XRD profiles are from
Compton scattering of a diamond anvil. The diffractions from NH₃BH₃ and
c-BN are weak and barely visible in the XRD profiles shown here. (b) V
(Å³/f.u.) vs P for Pt and PH-II. An open and a filled circle show the
data of sample 2 before (Pt) and after (PH-II) laser heating,
respectively. In the same manner, the open and filled pentagons and
hexagons show the data obtained in two independent preliminary
experiments (pre.ex.). The open diamonds are the reported data for
PtH-II synthesized in excess H₂ at room temperature [15]. The solid and
dashed lines are EOS of PtH-II and Pt [15,29,30].

synchrotron XRD profiles of sample 2 at room temperature before and
after the laser heating. The volume per formula unit [_V_ (A3/r.u.)] of
Pt (before heating) and PtH-II (after heating) are plotted as a function
of pressure. The crystal structure and lattice parameters [_P_63/_mmc_,
a = 2.776(1) A, c = 4.718(1) A at 41 GPa] of sample 2 after laser
heating showed excellent agreement with those of PtH-II synthesized in
high-pressure H2 at room temperature [15,19]. Besides, the lattice
parameters of PtH-II heated in excess H2 at 41 GPa was in good agreement
with the previously reported data [15,19] of PtH-II formed in excess H2
at room temperature (see Fig. s2 in the Supplemental Material [22]). By
these observations, it is thought that laser heating does not affect the
crystal structure of PtH, and the PtH3 synthesized in heated NH3BH3 has
the same or similar hydrogen content x = H/Pt as PtH. Therefore, we
assume that the x of our PtHx samples are 1 or almost 1. Here we note
that our XRD measurements confirmed that the formations of platinum
nitride (PtN, zinc-blende structure) [25], gold hydride (see also Fig.
s3 in the Supplemental Material [22]), and Na3Cl and NaCl3 [26] did not
occur (Fig. 1). In addition, it is empirically known that elemental Au
does not exhibit superconductivity at least at the pressures and
temperatures of the present experiments. Thus, in the sample chamber,
there was no possible material that contributed the observed
superconductivity, except for PtHx. It is also noted that the
synthesized PtHx sample was maintained for at least 12 hours at room
temperature without decomposition after its synthesis (see Fig. s4 in
the Supplemental Material [22]). The pressure was determined by using
the shift of the first-order Raman band spectra of the diamond anvil
facing the sample, with a proposed calibration [27]. The temperature
during the laser heating was estimated by collecting thermal radiation
from the sample and analyzing it in a wavelength between 600 and 800 nm
to convert to the temperature in accordance with Planck’s blackbody
radiation law [28]. The indicated pressures for electrical resistance
and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements were that obtained by
averaging the values obtained at room temperature before and after each
cooling and warming cycle. The actual pressures at low temperatures are
thought to be somewhat different from the indicated values.

## III Results

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the real part of the ac
magnetic susceptibility (_kh_’) of PtHx (sample 1) at different
pressures. We performed the measurements upon pressure decrease at 36,
32, and 28 GPa. The sharp drop of _kh_’ appears at 36 and 32 GPa at 4.8
and 6.7 K, respectively. Using the analysis discussed in detail
[22,31,32], the observed _kh_’ = 6-11 nV jump at _T_c is consistent with
perfect diamagnetism, suggesting that whole sample exhibits
superconductivity. At 28 GPa, near the pressure where the PtHx
transforms from PtH-II to PtH-I upon pressure decrease, no diamagnetic
signal is visible above 4.6 K [15]. It is thought that PtH-I is the
majority in sample 1 at 28 GPa, and the superconducting transition
vanished for temperatures above 4.6 K. Then, we conclude that the
observed superconducting transitions at 32 and 36 GPa are from PtH-II.

To obtain further evidence of the superconductivity, we performed the
electrical resistance measurements of PtH-II (samples 2 and 3). Figures
3(a) and 3(b) show the temperature dependence of the electrical
resistance (_R_) of PtH-II at 35 GPa (sample 2). In Fig. 3(a), the R vs
T curve has a positive slope at temperatures below 300 K, clearly
indicating that PtH-II is a metal. At 7.5 K, R exhibits a sharp
decrease, deviating from the linear dependence on the temperature. To
investigate the origin of the reduction of R, we performed the

fields. (a) R vs T curve of sample 2 (PtH-II) at 35 GPa in
zero-magnetic-field cooling (ZFC). The inset graph indicates the data
from 4.2 to 300 K. (b) R vs T curves of sample 3 (PHH-II) at 35 GPa in 0
T (ZFC), 0.1 T, and 0.5 T field cooled (FC). The R data were scaled at 9
K for comparison.

36 to 28 GPa. The superconducting transition shifts under decreasing
pressure to higher temperatures. No superconducting transition was
observed at 28 GPa. _T_c is determined from the temperature at the
transition onset. All data are on the same scale but are shifted
vertically.

electrical resistance measurements on sample 3 at 35 GPa in an external
magnetic field [Fig. 3(b)]. In the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) measurement
at 35 GPa, the R shows a sharp drop at 7 K, in agreement with sample 2.
When a magnetic field H = 0.1 T is applied, the decline of R shifts to
3.5 K and it vanishes for temperature above 2.8 K at H = 0.5 T. Since
the shift of T_(c) to lower temperatures in an external magnetic field
is one of the characteristics of superconductivity, the observed shift
of the resistance drop temperature strongly suggests the superconducting
transition of PtH-II. Regarding the electrical resistance measurements,
we note the following points. The electrical resistance measurements of
sample 2 were performed by a two-point contact method due to technical
difficulties. Each Au electrode was divided into two wires in the
vicinity of the samples [22]. In the experiments of sample 3, although a
four-point contact method was implemented, one of four electrodes (V2 in
Fig. s1(b) of the Supplemental Material [22]) was broken, and the
electrode (I2 in Fig. s1(b) of the Supplemental Material [22]) was
divided into two outside of a DAC using copper (Cu) wires. Therefore,
the measured R includes the contact resistance between electrodes and
samples, and the resistance of electrodes. In addition, it is thought
that a pressure gradient across the samples exists at high pressures.
Consequently, the R of samples 2 and 3 do not drop to zero at a T_(c)
and the transition becomes broad. The critical magnetic filed (H_(c)) is
estimated to be very small if we use the data shown in Fig. 3. However,
since the body of the DAC and the gasket were not completely nonmagnetic
at low temperatures, there is a possibility that the actual magnetic
flux on the sample was bigger than the indicated values. We leave the
investigation of the H_(c) to future studies.

Taking the data together, the present experiments provide unambiguous
evidence for the superconductivity of PtH-II. Remarkably, the observed
T_(c) of PtH-II is more than three orders of magnitude larger than that
of compacted-powder Pt [5].

## IV Discussions and Conclusion

For discussion, we compare the experimental results with theoretical
predictions. In Fig. 4, the T_(c) of sample 1 (ac magnetic
susceptibility measurements) is plotted as a function of pressure
together with the predicted T_(c)’s and structural phase diagrams [15,
16, 19]. Since the pressures at the T_(c)’s could not be measured, we
avoid plotting the T_(c)’s obtained for different samples (1-3) in the
same graph. The present experiments agree with theoretical predictions
at the point that PtH-II is a superconductor. On the other hand, the
observed T_(c)’s are almost half of the ones suggested by the
calculations based on a harmonic approximation. Furthermore, the
observed T_(c)’s are much higher than 0.4 K by a calculation that takes
account of anharmonic effects [18]. The reason for the discrepancies is
unknown at the current moment. In PdH_(x), it has been observed that the
T_(c) increases proportionally to the hydrogen content x = H/Pd in
PdH_(x)[11, 12]. Although we assume that the x of our PtH_(x) samples
are almost 1, there is no measure to count the number of x precisely at
high pressures such as 35 GPa with currently available experimental
techniques. If the observed T_(c) is for PtH_(x) with x less than 1, and
the x critically affects the T_(c), there would be some more chance to
obtain higher T_(c) by improving the stoichiometry. Such studies,
combining the observation of the isotope effect on the T_(c) of PtD,
would also advance our understanding of superconductivity in metal
hydrides and point out the way to obtain new superconductors.

In most superconducting d -metals, the presence of hydrogen in the metal
lattice either decreases the T_(c) (e.g., TcH, ReH_(x), VH, NbH,
ZrD_(x)) or does not affect it (e.g., RuH, MoH) [33, 34, 35]. Among the
transition metal hydrides synthesized so far, PdH and PtH are the only
materials that have higher T_(c) than elemental metals [11, 12, 36, 37,
38, 39, 40, 41, 42]. The _ab initio_ calculation by Kim _et. al._ has
predicted the formation of AuH, silver hydride (AgH), rhodium hydride
(RhH), and iridium hydride (Irh)₈ under high pressures. For all of them,
except AgH, superconductivity has been predicted [16]. In the periodic
table of elements, these noble metals possibly form a spot where their
hydrides exhibit superconductivity at higher temperatures than elements.
Although RhH does not exhibit a superconducting transition down to 0.3K
at ambient pressure, it would be worth extending the search to high
pressures [33].

In summary we have revealed the superconducting transition of PtH-II by
the ac magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistance, and XRD
measurements under high pressures. The T_(c) of PtH-II is 7 K at 30 GPa.
The present results provide a definitive answer to the question of
whether we can make a superconductor from Pt and H. Similarly to the
case of PdH, the observed highest T_(c) of PtH-II is more than 10³ times
higher than that of powder Pt [5, 11, 12]. The observation of the
superconductivity in PtH-II stimulates interest in other noble metal
hydrides because they possibly form a group whose metal hydrides have
higher T_(c) than that of elemental

Figure 4: T_(c) vs P for PtH_(x) (x≃ 1). The filled circle show the
T_(c) of sample 1. The down arrow at 28 GPa indicates that the
superconducting transition is not observed above 4.6 K. The rectangles
and hexagons are predicted T_(c) by _ab initio_ calculations [15, 16].
Dashed curves are guides for the eyes. The horizontal solid and dotted
lines placed above the graph indicate the structural phase boundaries
observed in the experiments and predicted by an _ab initio_ calculation
[15, 16], respectively. Both _ab initio_ calculations of Refs. [15, 16]
predict that PtH-II is stable at pressures above 80 GPa.

metals. Finally, the present experiments have an importance to the field
of high-pressure science. Pt has been widely used in high-pressure
experiments as a pressure calibrant, for electrical probes, and as a
heat absorber. Also, in the studies of several hydrides, for example, Pt
has been used for electrical probes [43, 44]. After the findings of the
decomposition of SiH₄, there have been arguments that the reported
superconducting transition of compressed SiH₄ was actually from Pt
formed in Pt electrodes by the H₂ from decomposed SiH₄[43, 45]. The
present study does not give the argument a clear answer because the
pressure range of the study is far below that of the experiments for
SiH₄. However, with the growing interest in high-temperature
superconducting metal hydrides, the results advise us to avoid the usage
of Pt as an electrode which contacts with hydrogen, hydrides, and other
hydrogen containing materials.
