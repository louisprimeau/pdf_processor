###### Abstract

NMR measurements have been carried out and modeled for underdoped Y(Ba1-yLa)2(Cu1-_x_Zn)4O8 superconductors. We find that the data are well described by Zn inducing a local moment, leading to a spin-density oscillation and an additional 89Y hyperfine field. We find an exchange energy increasing from ~50 to ~104 meV as the hole concentration is increased and an induced local moment which declines from 1.35 to 1.06_m_\({}_{B}\). Magnetic pair breaking can fully account for the decrease in _T_c with Zn substitution for the La-free materials. With progressive underdoping, magnetic pair breaking is increasingly unable to account for the decline in _T_c with Zn substitution suggesting that Zn weakens the pairing interaction as in the spin-fluctuation pairing model.

Recent experiments have shown that there is a strong correlation between the magnetic properties and high-temperature superconductivity of superconducting cuprates. At low temperatures a gap in the normal-state spin-excitation spectrum exists that is strongly correlated with hole doping.[1] Measurements of the electronic entropy suggest that this gap occurs for the total excitation spectrum including charge degrees of freedom.[2] Drawing from these ideas, Tallon _et al.[3]_ have recently shown that the superconducting phase diagram can be explained by the opening of this normal-state gap on the underdoped side and pair breaking on the overdoped side due to excitations above the gap. The normal-state gap has been seen in heat capacity,[4] susceptibility,[2] NMR,[5] infrared conductivity,[6] resistivity, and thermopower measurements[7] but it should be distinguished from the "spin-gap" observed in neutron scattering.[3] It is therefore important that the magnetic properties of high-temperature superconducting cuprates be fully investigated. In particular, investigating the way in which magnetic or nonmagnetic impurities suppress superconductivity should assist in the understanding of the superconductivity pairing mechanism. Monthoux and Pines[8] have recently developed a spin-fluctuation-induced pairing theory in which they conclude that Zn substitution for Cu disrupts local magnetic order leading to a decrease in the pairing energy. Zn substitution is unusual in that in YBa2Cu3O7-_f_ it generally produces no change in hole concentration[7] but causes a rapid decrease in _T_c and leads to the creation of local moments, even though Zn is nonmagnetic.[9] By comparison, substitution of Cu by Ni leads only to a modest decrease in _T_c with increasing Ni concentrations.[10] Walstedt _et al.[11]_ have performed 65Cu NMR and susceptibility measurements on Zn-substituted YBa2Cu3O7 and conclude that the decrease in _T_c with increasing Zn content is not due to magnetic pair breaking. However Mahajan _et al.[12]_ show from susceptibility and 89Y Knight-shift measurements on Zn substituted YBa2Cu3O6.64 that the decrease in _T_c with Zn substitution can be partially attributed to magnetic pair breaking with an exchange energy of \(J\) ~75 meV.

In this paper we report on 89Y NMR measurements on Zn-substituted underdoped Y(Ba1-yLa)2Cu4O8. The advantage of the YBa2Cu4O8 system is that it does not suffer from oxygen disorder. Oxygen disorder on the chains in YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ can lead to an asymmetric peak and, near optimal doping, two peaks have been observed. Furthermore, as the oxygen content is reduced, oxygen vacancy ordering on the Cu-O chains is known to occur.[13] Finally, Zn substitution in YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ can result in changes in \(d\) whereas in YBa2Cu4O8 both the oxygen content and hole concentration remain fixed, even in La or Ca doped compounds.[7] We will show by detailed modeling of our 89Y NMR data that the local moment induced by Zn substitution is moderately dependent on hole concentration and that the decrease in _T_c with Zn substitution, for all except the lowest hole concentration, can be wholly attributed to magnetic pair breaking.

The Y(Ba1-yLa)2(Cu1-_x_Zn)4O8 samples were prepared by decomposing a stoichiometric mix of Y2O3, La(NO3)3-6H2O, Ba(NO3)2, CuO, and ZnO powders in air at 700 degC. The samples were reacted for 6 h at 930 degC, 48 h at 940 degC, and a further 48 h at 940 degC in oxygen at a pressure of 6 MPa.[14] All samples were reground after each sinter. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the samples were single-phase material.

The 89Y NMR signal was measured between 80 K and room temperature using a Varian Unity 500 spectrometer with a 11.74 T superconducting magnet. The room-temperature measurements were made by magic angle spinning (MAS) using a Doty 5 mm high-speed MAS probe, and spinning speeds of 10 kHz to reduce the 89Y NMR linewidth. Bloch decay spectra were acquired using a delay of 20 s between 90\({}^{\circ}\) pulses. Static temperature-dependent measurements were made using a Doty 5 mm probe, and 89Y NMR spectra were acquired using the spin-echo technique with a 20 s delay at room temperature increasing to 150 s at 90 K to account for the increased spin-lattice relaxation time at low temperatures. The NMR shifts were measured relative to a 1\(m\) aqueous solution of YCl3 which had a Larmor frequency of 24.49 MHz. Spin-lattice relaxation measurements were made at room temperature using a saturating 90\({}^{\circ}\) comb.

The substitution of La for Ba leads to a progressive underdoping of the parent compound and results in superconducting transition temperatures of 81, 64, and 44 K, for La contents of \(y\) = 0, 0.05 and 0.1. From the _T_c/_T_c,max values we estimate the hole concentrations [15] to be \(p\) = 0.120, 0.098, and 0.080, respectively. We have previously shown that the effect of Zn is to dramatically decrease _T_c without altering the hole concentration on the Cu-O planes [16] and to locally suppress the normal-state gap about the Zn impurity without altering the gap energy away from the Zn impurity.

The effect of Zn on the low-temperature and room-temperature 89Y NMR spectra can be seen in Figs. 1 and 2 for the YBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{0.9625}\)Zn\({}_{0.0375}\))\({}_{A}\)O\({}_{8}\), YBa\({}_{0.95}\)La\({}_{0.05}\))\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{0.975}\)Zn\({}_{0.025}\))\({}_{A}\)O\({}_{8}\), and Y(Ba\({}_{0.9}\)La\({}_{0.1}\))\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{0.975}\)Zn\({}_{0.025}\))\({}_{A}\)O\({}_{8}\) samples. The low-temperature spectra are symmetric and broader than the room-temperature spectra. We have previously shown that 89Y NMR spectra from YBa(Cu\({}_{1-x}\)Zn\({}_{x}\))\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{8}\) samples can be modeled as consisting of two peaks [16]. The satellite peak (peak 2 in Fig. 1) was attributed to Y adjacent to a Zn atom while the main peak (peak 1 in Fig. 1) was associated with Y atoms which are not nearest neighbors to a Zn atom. The effect of Zn substitution can also be seen in Figs. 3 and 4 where we show the room temperature 89Y NMR MAS spectra for YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{8}\), YBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{0.9875}\)Zn\({}_{0.0125}\))\({}_{A}\)O\({}_{8}\), and YBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{0.9625}\)Zn\({}_{0.0375}\))\({}_{A}\)O\({}_{8}\) and the corresponding linewidths as a function of Zn. The MAS spectra are much narrower than the static spectra due to the removal of dipole-dipole broadening and hence it is possible to see that the 89Y NMR linewidth becomes larger with Zn substitution.

The 89Y NMR spectra in Figs. 1-3 and the corresponding linewidth data in Fig. 4 are modeled by considering the effect of local moments which are known to be induced by Zn substitution for planar Cu atoms [9]. The local moments induce a spatially varying static spin density that can be described by the exchange Hamiltonian \(H_{\rm ex}\)=\(-J\Sigma_{\rm r^{\prime}}{\bf S}^{\prime}\cdot{\bf S}({\bf r^{\prime}})\) where \({\bf S}^{\prime}\) is the local moment spin operator, \({\bf S}({\bf r^{\prime}})\) is the conduction band carrier spin operator and \(J\) is the exchange energy. Walstedt _et al._[11] have used the formalism of

The dotted curves and dashed curves are as in Fig. 1.

  Pennington and Slichter [17] to show that the resultant spin at site \({\bf r^{\prime}}\!=\!(n_{x},n_{y})\) is \(S_{z}\!=\!-\!\left|\rho J\right|\!(\xi/a)\beta^{1/2}\langle S_{t}^{\dagger} \rangle\)\(\times(4\,\pi)^{-2}(-1)^{n\pi+n_{y}}\Sigma_{z^{\prime}}\exp(-\left|{\bf r}+{ \bf r^{\prime}}\right|^{2}/4\,\xi^{2})\) where \(\rho\) is the spin density of states, \(\beta\) is the conduction-band dynamic-susceptibility scale parameter, \(\xi\) is the antiferromagnetic coherence length, and \(a\) is the average lattice parameter in the \(ab\) plane. The \({}^{89}\)Y hyperfine field arising from the spin density oscillation is \(H({\bf r})\!=\!D_{\rm Cu}\Sigma S_{z}({\bf r^{+}}\!+\!{\bf r^{\prime}})\) where \(D_{\rm Cu}\!=\!-3\) kG (Ref. [18]) and the sum is over the eight nearest Cu atoms. The \({}^{89}\)Y NMR data were fitted by randomly distributing Zn on two 100\(\times\)100 square lattices to simulate the two CuO\({}_{2}\) planes, computing the spin on each copper and then adding up the spins about each Y atom. The fitted spectra from Y with Zn as a nearest neighbor (satellite peak) and Y where Zn is not a nearest neighbor (main peak) are shown in Figs. 1-3. The fitted spectra were summed and then convoluted with a Gaussian to account for the instrumental and processing-induced spectral broadening. It can be seen in Figs. 1-3 that this model describes the data well. In particular, this model also accounts for the increase in the room-temperature MAS linewidths as shown in Fig. 4. The \(\xi\) values were estimated from the neutron-scattering data of Rossat-Mignod _et al._ (\(\xi\!=\!1.2a\), \(1.5a\), and \(2.4a\) for 0, 0.05, and 0.1 La). [19] The parameter evaluated by fitting our NMR data is \(\gamma\!=\!\left|D_{\rm Cu}\rho J\right|\!\beta^{1/2}\langle S_{t}^{\dagger} \rangle/\!\left(B_{16}\pi^{2}\right)\), where \(B\) is the magnetic field. We find that \(\gamma\!=\!34\times\!10^{-6}\), \(31\!\times\!10^{-6}\), and \(21\!\times\!10^{-6}\) for the 0, 0.05, and 0.1 La, respectively. Taking [20]\(\beta^{1/2}\!=\!10\) and \(\rho\!=\!3\) states/eV (Ref. [12]) we find that \(\left|JP_{\rm eff}\right|\!=\!110\), 100, and 68 meV for each La concentration, respectively, where \(P_{\rm eff}\) is the size of the local moment in \(\mu_{B}\). The reduction in \(\left|JP_{\rm eff}\right|\) with underdoping results primarily from the increasing correlation length \(\xi\).

The size of the local moment per Zn atom is estimated from the \({}^{89}\)Y NMR shift of the satellite peak by noting that in the absence of Zn, the \({}^{89}\)Y NMR shift is (Ref. [21]) \(K\!=\!8D\chi_{s}/g\mu_{B}\!+\!\sigma\) where \(\chi_{s}\) is the static spin susceptibility per planar CuO\({}_{2}\) unit due to the transferred hyperfine interaction between Y and the electrons in the conduction band, \(g\) is the electron \(g\) factor, and \(\sigma\) is the chemical shift [152 ppm (Ref. [22])]. Thus we write the \({}^{89}\)Y NMR shift of the satellite peak for Zn substituted samples as

\[K\!=\!7D_{\rm Cu}\chi_{s}/(g\,\mu_{B})\!+\!D_{\rm Zn}\chi_{c}/(g\,\mu_{B})+\sigma,\] (1)

where \(D_{\rm Zn}\) is the transferred hyperfine coupling constant from the spin on the Zn site to the \({}^{89}\)Y nuclei and \(\chi_{c}\) is the static susceptibility of the induced moment per Zn atom. We express \(\chi_{c}\) in a manner similar to \(\chi_{s}\) leading to

\[\chi_{c}\!=\!\chi_{m}/(c\,N_{A}),\] (2)

where \(\chi_{m}\) is the molar susceptibility of the local moments, \(c\!(=\!4x)\) is the Zn fraction per formula unit, and \(N_{A}\) is Avogadro's constant. Thus,

\[\chi_{c}\!=\!(\mu_{B}^{2}P_{\rm eff}^{2})/(3\,k_{B}T).\] (3)

The temperature dependence of the \({}^{89}\)Y NMR shift of the satellite peak is shown in Fig. 5 for YBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{0.9875}\)Zn\({}_{0.0125}\))\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{8}\), YBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{0.9652}\)Zn\({}_{0.0375}\))\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{8}\), Y(Ba\({}_{0.95}\)La\({}_{0.05}\))\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{0.975}\)Zn\({}_{0.025}\))\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{8}\), and Y(Ba\({}_{0.91}\)La\({}_{0.12}\)) (Cu\({}_{0.975}\)Zn\({}_{0.025}\))\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{8}\). The NMR shift of this peak is independent of Zn content as expected from Eqs. (1) and (3). Thus for YBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{0.9875}\)Zn\({}_{0.025}\))\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{8}\), we find that the NMR shift is \(K\!=\!9500/T\!+\!35\), \(10\,500/T\!+\!25\), and \(11\,000/T\!+\!15\) for 0, 0.05, and 0.1 La. The constant term is \(\frac{3}{5}\) times the Knight shift for the corresponding superconductors without Zn. To estimate the size of the induced local moment we take \(D_{\rm Zn}\!\!=\!D_{\rm Cu}\). This assumption is consistent with the observation that both Cu and Zn have \(3d\) outermost occupied levels and implies that both the conduction-band wave functions and Zn impurity wave functions at the Fermi level are similar. Previous thermopower data showed that the Fermi level is independent of Zn concentration, [16] which is consistent with the Zn-O orbital being within the Cu-O conduction band. The resultant effective moments per Zn atom are 1.06, 1.12, and \(1.35\mu_{B}\) which are slightly greater than the value of \(P_{\rm eff}\!\sim\!1\) found by Walstedt _et al._[11] from susceptibility measurements on YBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{1-x}\)Zn\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) and the value of \(P_{\rm eff}\!\sim\!0.86\) used by Mahajan _et al._[12] in YBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{1-x}\)Zn\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{6.64}\). Thus, we find that the induced moment is moderately dependent on hole doping. The corresponding values of the exchange energy obtained from the estimates of \(P_{\rm eff}\) and the fitted \(\gamma D\) values are \(J\!=\!104\), 89, and 50 meV for La contents of 0, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. By comparison Walstedt _et al._[11] deduced \(J\!=\!5\) meV from \({}^{63}\)Cu NMR measurements on YBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{1-x}\)Zn\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) and Mahajan _et al._[12] estimated \(J\!=\!75\) meV from \({}^{89}\)Y NMR measurements on YBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{1-x}\)Zn\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{6.64}\). The latter compound is in a similar, though slightly lower, doping state to our 5% La substituted YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{8}\) samples and hence its \(J\) values is in reasonable agreement with the \(p\)-dependent values we report.

The experimental \(\left|JP_{\rm eff}\right|\) value for YBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{1-x}\)Zn\({}_{x}\))\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{8}\) can be used to estimate the change in the \({}^{89}\)Y NMR spin lattice relaxation rates expected with Zn substitution. Gio  vannini and Heeger[23] have shown that the spin density oscillation induced by the local moment results in a spin lattice relaxation time that can be expressed as,

\[T_{1}(c) = T_{1}(c = 0)/[1 + (6c\langle S_{z}^{L}\rangle J_{\rm eff}^{2}/\pi E_{F}g\mu_{B})],\] (4)

where \(J_{\rm eff}\)\({}^{\rm now}\)\(4J\) (Ref. [11]) and \(E_{F}\) is the Fermi energy. The experimental room-temperature spin-lattice relaxation rates are shown in the insert in Fig. 5. Also plotted are the theoretical spin-lattice relaxation rates as determined from Eq. (4) and using \(|JP_{\rm eff}|=\)\(107\) meV. We find that the experimental spin-lattice relaxation rates are consistent with the deduced \(|JP_{\rm eff}|\).

The decrease in \(T_{c}\) from magnetic pair breaking can be estimated from the experimental \(|JP_{\rm eff}|\) values. Using the Abrikosov-Gorkov[24] formula \(T_{c}\) should decrease by \(\Delta T_{c}\) = \(\frac{7}{6\pi}\)\({}^{2}c\rho J_{\rm eff}^{2}S(S+1)/k_{B}\), for small magnetic-impurity concentrations. However, as \(S(S+1)\) can be estimated from the size of the induced moment per Zn atom, \(P_{\rm eff}\)\({}_{\rm eff}\)\({}_{\rm 2}\)\({}_{\rm 2}\)\({}_{\rm 2}\)\({}_{\rm 2}\)\({}_{\rm 2}\)\({}_{\rm 2}\)\({}_{\rm 2}\) then the Abrikosov-Gorkov formula can be rewritten as

\[\Delta T_{c} = \frac{7}{6\pi}\)\({}^{2}c\rho|JP_{\rm eff}|^{2}/g^{2}k_{B}\,.\] (5)

Thus using the fitted \(|JP_{\rm eff}|\) value of 110 meV we find magnetic pair breaking in the YBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{0.975}\)Zn\({}_{0.025}\))\({}_{\rm 4}\)O\({}_{\rm 8}\) sample should cause \(T_{c}\) to decrease by \(\sim\) 61 K, which is close to the experimental value of \(\Delta T_{c}\) = 69 K. Indeed, when the full nonlinear Abrikosov-Gorkov theory is used the pair-broken depression of \(T_{c}\) agrees remarkably well with the observed data. Figure 6 shows the observed \(T_{c}\) values plotted as a function of Zn fraction for 0, 5, and 10% La, while the solid curves are the Abrikosov-Gorkov theory using the above- deduced \(|JP_{\rm eff}|\) values. It can be seen that magnetic pair breaking can fully account for the decrease in \(T_{c}\) for the La-free superconductors but not for the most underdoped samples with 10% La. This implies that for the very underdoped superconductors Zn strongly reduces the pairing potential while near optimal doping the pairing potential is only moderately reduced. These results are consistent with the spin fluctuation model of Monthoux and Pines[8] which presents a reduction in the pairing potential with Zn substitution which is strongly increasing with the antiferromagnetic correlation length.

In summary, we have performed \({}^{89}\)Y NMR measurements on underdoped YBa\({}_{2-y}\)La\({}_{y}\)(Cu\({}_{1-x}\)Zn\({}_{y}\))\({}_{\rm 4}\)O\({}_{\rm 8}\) samples and modeled the data using the formalism of Pennington and Slichter. The local moment induced by the Zn atoms increases moderately with hole doping while the exchange energy increases rapidly. From the deduced exchange energy we find that magnetic pair breaking by the induced local moments can fully explain the rapid depression in \(T_{c}\) with Zn substitution for La-free samples. However, as the samples become more underdoped magnetic pair breaking is increasingly unable to account for the observed decline in \(T_{c}\) which probably occurs predominantly via a reducing pairing interaction.
