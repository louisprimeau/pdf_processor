###### Abstract

Detailed studies of the superconducting diamagnetism of La_{2-x-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} show that the characteristic concentration x_{\rm dip} at which the largest T_{c} suppression is observed changes from 0.115 to 0.125 on Nd doping around y\sim0.12, above which the structural transition to the low-temperature tetragonal (LTT) phase is observed. This indicates that also in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, the x_{\rm dip} value is, in principle, also \frac{1}{8} as in La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4}. We propose that the largest T_{c} suppression around x\sim0.115 in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} is the result of the existence of two competitive factors. One is the local distortion expanding the LTT region around the Sr^{2+} ion, which is largest at x = \frac{1}{8} and acts to suppress T_{c}. The other is the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation energy, which might increase with x and acts to increase T_{c}. On Nd doping, the former factor becomes larger around x = 0.125 than around x = 0.115 and the x_{\rm dip} value moves to 0.125.

It is well known that suppression of T_{c} is observed in a narrow x region around \frac{1}{8} in La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4} (Ref. 1) and in the rare-earth-doped La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}. [2, 3] Although extensive studies have been performed on this subject, its origin still remains to be solved. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] These compounds exhibit a structural transition at T_{d2} from the LTO1 (low-temperature orthorhombic 1, space group _Bmab_) to LTT (low-temperature tetragonal, space group _P4_{2}/ncm_) or LTO2 (low-temperature orthorhombic 2, space group _Pccn_) phase around x\sim\frac{1}{8}. [4] In La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, unlike La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4}, the T_{c} suppression appears centered around x\sim0.115, which was clarified in the Zn-doped samples by Koike _et al._, [11] and muon spin resonance (\muSR) and nuclear quadrupole resonance (NOR) experiments exhibited antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering centered around x\sim0.115, [12, 13, 14] while the AF ordering in La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4} is observed centered around x\sim0.125. [15, 16] Thus the x value where the anomalous T_{c} suppression is observed is different between La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4} and La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}. Furthermore, in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, the system is in the LTO1 phase down to low temperatures, while signs of the structural transition to the LTT phase were observed below \sim10 K around x\sim0.12 by studies of the ultrasonic sound velocity. [17] We define the x value where the largest T_{c} suppression is observed as the x_{\rm dip} value. The origin of the different x_{\rm dip} values between La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4} and La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} is still unknown. In order to clarify the origin of the T_{c} suppression centered around x\sim0.115 in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, we have performed detailed studies of the superconducting diamagnetism of samples with low T_{d2} in the La_{2-x-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system. In this system, the critical concentration y_{c} above which the structural transition to the LTT phase appears at low temperatures is \sim0.12, which is relatively high compared with those of the Sm-, Eu-, and Gd-doped systems, and T_{d2} can be as low as \sim30 K. [18]

In our previous paper, [18] we proposed the following mechanism for the structural transition from the LTO1 to the LTT phase. Two LTT (or LTO2) and two LTO1 regions are induced around the doped ion by superposition of the isotropic distortion of the CuO_{6} octahedra around the doped ion and the cooperative tilts of the CuO_{6} octahedra in the LTO1 phase. The structural transition to the LLT phase takes place when the LTT region is connected by percolation in a whole area of the crystal. Coexistence of the LTT and LTO1 regions is inevitable.

In this paper, we show that in La_{2-x-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, the x_{\rm dip} value changes from x = 0.115 to 0.125 around t\sim 0.12, above which the structural transition to the LTT phase appears. This indicates that the x_{\rm dip} value is, in principle, \frac{1}{8} also in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} and the origin of x_{\rm dip}\sim0.115 in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} is the result of the existence of two competitive factors.

All the samples were sintered ones prepared by a standard solid-state reaction method mentioned elsewhere. [10] The dc magnetization measurement was carried out using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. The thermal conductivity was measured by the usual steady-state method.

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity \kappa of La_{1.875-y}Nd_{0.125}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}. A small enhancement or kink is observed in \kappa below \sim30 K in the

 samples with 0.115 \approxx\approx0.18, as shown by the arrows. This anomaly of \kappa originates in the structural transition to the LTT phase. Previously, we reported that the structural transition to the LTT phase appears at low temperatures above y^{\sim}^{\sim}^{1} in La_{1.875-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{0.125}CuO_{4} (Ref. [18]) and the enhancement of \kappa below T_{d2} increases with y up to \sim0.2, where it is much larger and more pronounced than those of the present samples with y = 0.125.[19] In the samples with x = 0.11 and 0.2, no anomaly is seen in the temperature dependence of \kappa, which indicates that the structural transition does not exist in these samples.

Figures 2-5 show the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility M/H of La_{1.885-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{0.115}CuO_{4}, La_{1.875-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{0.125}CuO_{4}, La_{2.-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, and La_{1.875-y}Nd_{0.125}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, respectively. These results show that two superconducting transitions exist in La_{2-x-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} above y\sim0.125 and in a narrow x region between 0.115 and 0.135. We define the lower and higher T_{c} as T_{c}^{l} and T_{c}^{k}, respectively. In La_{1.875-y}Nd_{0.125}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, the x value of 0.115 corresponds to the smallest x concentration where the structural transition to the LTT phase appears, as shown in Fig. 1. This indicates that the above anomalous behavior of the M/H-T curve should be attributed to the entrance into the LTT phase. Previously, we showed that the coexistence of the LTT and LT01 regions is inevitable below T_{d2},[18] and we propose that T_{c}^{l} and T_{c}^{k} and the T_{c}^{c}'s of the LTT and LT01 regions, respectively. When T_{d2} is low, a comparable LT01 region coexists with the LTT region below T_{d2} because the distortion around the substituted ion does not extend far. The existence of two superconducting phases is the result of competition between the size of the LTT or LT01 regions and the short superconducting coherence length in the present high-T_{c} cuprates, which depends on x. The present results suggest that the volume fraction of the LTT region increases and that of the LT01 region decreases rapidly with further increase of y above 0.125.

Here, we discuss the possibility of site-selective substitution in the La-Sr or La-Ba system. The ionic radius of Sr^{2+} is larger than that of La^{3+}. Thus, it is expected that each Sr^{2+} ion is substituted in isolation from other Sr^{2+} ions, because

  of the difference of the valence and ionic radius between the La^{3+} and Sr^{2+} ions. When Nd^{3+} ions are doped into the La-Sr system, we expect that S^{2+} and Nd^{3+} ions are substituted as a pair as shown in Fig. 6 because of the smaller ionic radius of Nd^{3+} compared to La^{3+}. This enhances the LTT distortion around the doped ions. This pair may have a tendency to order so as to make the volume fraction of the LTT region maximum when x\!=\!\frac{1}{s}. In La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4}, the ionic radius of Ba^{2+} is much larger than that of La^{3+} compared to that of Sr^{2+} and the local distortion around Ba^{2+} is large enough to induce the structural transition to the LTT phase. On the other hand, in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, the difference of the ionic radius between the Sr^{2+} and La^{3+} ions is not so large that the Sr doping can induce the macroscopic structural transition by itself. However, if Nd^{3+} ions are doped, the local distortion around Sr^{2+} is enhanced by the above proposed pairing substitution and the structural transition is induced. However, in La_{1.75}Nd_{0.125}Sr_{0.125}CuO_{4}, T_{d2} is \sim30 K, which is half of the value of \sim65 K in La_{1.875}Ba_{0.125}CuO_{4}. This means that the range where the local lattice distortion, i.e., the LTT region, around the substituted ion extends is rather smaller in the former than in the latter. Because of this difference, the volume fraction of the LTT region at the lowest temperature may be a few times larger in La_{1.875}Ba_{0.125}CuO_{4} than in La_{1.75}Nd_{0.125}Sr_{0.125}CuO_{4}. In La_{1.875-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{0.125}CuO_{4}, with further increase of y above 0.125, Nd^{3+} ions may be substituted near Sr^{2+} ions in the same LaO layer, which also enhances the local distortion around the Sr^{2+} ions and such a region where the local distortion is large becomes the core of the LTT region. Thus the LTT region expands with further increase of y. In this way, in the La-Sr or La-Ba system, site-selective substitution possibly plays an important role in various physical properties. La-site or Cu-site substitution effects in these systems should be reexamined carefully from this point of view. We note that if both x and y are smaller than \sim0.11, the LTT region is not connected in a whole area of the crystal by percolation.

Figure 7(a) shows the y dependence of T_{c}^{h}, T_{c}^{l}, and T_{d2} of La_{1.885-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{0.115}CuO_{4} and La_{1.875-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{0.125}CuO_{4}. T_{d2} is determined from measurements of \kappa. This figure clearly shows that the superconducting properties are very different below and above y\!\sim\!0.12 between the samples with x\!=\!0.115 and those with x\!=\!0.125. In the small-y region, T_{c}^{h} is higher in the samples with x\!=\!0.125 than in those with x\!=\!0.115. However, T_{c}^{h} of the samples with x\!=\!0.125 begins to decrease with y above \sim\!0.06 and almost coincides with that for x\!=\!0.115 at y\!=\!0.1. Above y\!\sim\!0.115, T_{c}^{l} appears, and is clearly related to the appearance of the LTT phase. Although T_{c}^{h} does not change very much even above y\!\sim\!0.125 in either system, T_{c}^{l} shows a clear difference between these two systems. T_{c}^{l} of the samples with x\!=\!0.125 is lower than for those with x\!=\!0.115 for x\!>\!0.125. This difference should be related to the difference of T_{d2} between the two systems as shown in Fig. 7(a). That is, the existence of the LTT region is the origin of the lower T_{c}^{l} in the samples with x\!=\!0.125 above y\!\sim\!0.12. This is clearly seen in the M/H\!-\!T curves of the y\!=\!0.125 samples with x\!=\!0.115 and 0.125 as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. In this way, the x_{\rm dip} value in La_{2-x-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} changes from 0.115 to 0.125 around y\!\sim\!0.12, which indicates that in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, the x_{\rm dip} value is, in principle, \sharp is in La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4}. Figure 7(b) shows the x dependence of the magnitude of the Meissner volume fraction at 4.2 K of La_{2-x-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (y\!=\!0, 0.125, and 0.14). This figure clearly shows that the Meissner volume fraction exhibits a minimum around x\!\sim\!0.12, which

  is similar to the x dependence of T_{c}^{l} observed for 0.115\approx\pm0.135. Even in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, the minimum of the Meissner volume fraction at 4.2 K is seen around x\sim0.12. This means that even if the system is in the LTO1 phase, the superconducting state is greatly influenced around x\sim0.12. This is more easily seen in the magnetic susceptibility of La_{1.775}Nd_{0.1}Sr_{0.125}CuO_{4}. In this sample, although the macroscopic transition to the LTT phase does not exist, a small kink is observed at \sim22 K in the M/H-T curve, which is a sign of the existence of T_{c}^{l} and suggests the existence of a local LTT region with an appropriate size even in the LTO1 phase.

Next, we discuss the origin of the suppression of T_{c} around x\sim\frac{1}{8}. Which is more important for the anomalous T_{c} suppression: the carrier concentration of x\sim\frac{1}{8} or the lattice distortion induced by Sr or Ba doping with x\sim\frac{1}{8}? The present results show that the superconducting properties change drastically accompanying the appearance of the LTT phase. In the samples with x = 0.125, T_{c} decreases rapidly above y\sim0.06, and above y\sim0.125 T_{c}^{l} is lower than that of the sample with x = 0.115 as shown in Fig. 7(a). It is difficult to imagine that the carrier concentration is changed abruptly by the Nd doping above y\sim0.06 only in the samples with x = 0.125. It is natural to ascribe the change to the enhancement of the lattice distortion induced by the Nd doping, which is larger in the system with x = 0.125 than in the system with x = 0.115. That is, the Sr concentration of x\sim\frac{1}{8} is more important for the T_{c} suppression around x\sim\frac{1}{8} than the carrier concentration of x\sim\frac{1}{8}. We propose that Sr^{2+} ions have a tendency to order as one Sr^{2+} ion for 4\times4 La sites and the LTT region around the Sr^{2+} ion is most easily connected by percolation when x = \frac{1}{8}. The shift of the x_{\rm dip} value from 0.115 to 0.125 caused by the Nd doping indicates the existence of two competitive factors. One suppresses T_{c} the most at x\sim\frac{1}{8} and the other increases T_{c} with increasing x. The origin of the former factor is the existence of the LTT phase whose volume fraction is largest around x\sim\frac{1}{8}. As the origin of the latter factor, the increase of the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation energy \Gamma_{Q} or the superconducting coherence length with an increase of x can be considered. Here, we discuss the importance of the AF spin fluctuation. Kitaoka _et al._ discussed the importance of \Gamma_{Q} based on the results for (T_{1}T)^{-1} of ^{63}Cu in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}. [20] Here, T_{1} is the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time. Tou _et al._ reported that 1/T_{1} of Cu in La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4} increases below T_{d2}, showing a tendency to diverge toward T_{N}\sim35 K in a sample with x = 0.125,[21] which indicates that the AF spin fluctuation is drastically affected by the structural transition around x\sim\frac{1}{8}. These results indicate that \Gamma_{Q} decreases below T_{d2}. The AF ordering is observed only around x = \frac{1}{2} where the volume fraction of the LTT region is largest. In the LTT phase where the LTT and LTO1 regions coexist, \Gamma_{Q} is expected to be smaller in the LTT region than in the LTO1 region. This may be related to the existence of two superconducting transition temperatures T_{c}^{l} and T_{c}^{h} in the present system. That is, T_{c}^{l} and T_{c}^{h} are the T_{c}'s in the LTT and LTO1 regions, respectively. In La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, local LTT regions are expected to exist above x\sim0.11 and are largest at x\sim\frac{1}{8} , and the LTT distortion effect suppressing T_{c} should be largest at x\sim\frac{1}{8}. However, this distortion effect is not very large because of the small difference of the ionic radius between La^{3+} and Sr^{2+} ions. On the other hand, \Gamma_{Q} is expected to increase with x. It is expected that the smaller the x value, the more easily \Gamma_{Q} is affected by the LTT distortion. As a result of these two competing effects, the x_{\rm dip} value is observed around x\sim0.115 in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}. It is noted that when x is smaller than 0.11, the LTT distortion effect is very small as mentioned above. In La_{2-x}-Nd_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} or La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4}, the LTT distortion effect induced by the doped ion is large enough to greatly suppress \Gamma_{Q} at x\sim\frac{1}{8}. In this way, the shift of the x_{\rm dip} value from 0.115 to 0.125 on Nd doping in La_{2-x}-Nd_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} can be understood as the result of the existence of two factors. The x-dependent coherence length may also correlate with the shift of the x_{\rm dip} value.

Recently, the possibility that the stripe correlations of spins and holes play an essential role in the T_{c} suppression around x\sim\frac{1}{8} was discussed based on neutron diffraction experiments on La_{1.6-x}Nd_{0.4}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (x\sim 0.12).[22] At present, we do not know if the same situation is realized in samples with smaller y values, i.e., lower T_{d2}. However, as pointed out by the authors of Ref. [22], even in the LTO1 phase, similar stripe correlations as in the LTT phase can possibly be realized dynamically and the present results should be examined from this point of view. Neutron-scattering experiments on samples with low T_{d2} in La_{2-x-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} are desirable.

###### Abstract

Detailed studies of the superconducting diamagnetism of La_{2-x-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} show that the characteristic concentration x_{\rm dip} at which the largest T_{c} suppression is observed changes from 0.115 to 0.125 on Nd doping around y\sim0.12, above which the structural transition to the low-temperature tetragonal (LTT) phase is observed. This indicates that also in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, the x_{\rm dip} value is, in principle, also \frac{1}{8} as in La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4}. We propose that the largest T_{c} suppression around x\sim0.115 in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} is the result of the existence of two competitive factors. One is the local distortion expanding the LTT region around the Sr^{2+} ion, which is largest at x = \frac{1}{8} and acts to suppress T_{c}. The other is the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation energy, which might increase with x and acts to increase T_{c}. On Nd doping, the former factor becomes larger around x = 0.125 than around x = 0.115 and the x_{\rm dip} value moves to 0.125.

It is well known that suppression of T_{c} is observed in a narrow x region around \frac{1}{8} in La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4} (Ref. 1) and in the rare-earth-doped La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}. [2, 3] Although extensive studies have been performed on this subject, its origin still remains to be solved. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] These compounds exhibit a structural transition at T_{d2} from the LTO1 (low-temperature orthorhombic 1, space group _Bmab_) to LTT (low-temperature tetragonal, space group _P4_{2}/ncm_) or LTO2 (low-temperature orthorhombic 2, space group _Pccn_) phase around x\sim\frac{1}{8}. [4] In La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, unlike La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4}, the T_{c} suppression appears centered around x\sim0.115, which was clarified in the Zn-doped samples by Koike _et al._, [11] and muon spin resonance (\muSR) and nuclear quadrupole resonance (NOR) experiments exhibited antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering centered around x\sim0.115, [12, 13, 14] while the AF ordering in La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4} is observed centered around x\sim0.125. [15, 16] Thus the x value where the anomalous T_{c} suppression is observed is different between La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4} and La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}. Furthermore, in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, the system is in the LTO1 phase down to low temperatures, while signs of the structural transition to the LTT phase were observed below \sim10 K around x\sim0.12 by studies of the ultrasonic sound velocity. [17] We define the x value where the largest T_{c} suppression is observed as the x_{\rm dip} value. The origin of the different x_{\rm dip} values between La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4} and La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} is still unknown. In order to clarify the origin of the T_{c} suppression centered around x\sim0.115 in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, we have performed detailed studies of the superconducting diamagnetism of samples with low T_{d2} in the La_{2-x-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system. In this system, the critical concentration y_{c} above which the structural transition to the LTT phase appears at low temperatures is \sim0.12, which is relatively high compared with those of the Sm-, Eu-, and Gd-doped systems, and T_{d2} can be as low as \sim30 K. [18]

In our previous paper, [18] we proposed the following mechanism for the structural transition from the LTO1 to the LTT phase. Two LTT (or LTO2) and two LTO1 regions are induced around the doped ion by superposition of the isotropic distortion of the CuO_{6} octahedra around the doped ion and the cooperative tilts of the CuO_{6} octahedra in the LTO1 phase. The structural transition to the LLT phase takes place when the LTT region is connected by percolation in a whole area of the crystal. Coexistence of the LTT and LTO1 regions is inevitable.

In this paper, we show that in La_{2-x-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, the x_{\rm dip} value changes from x = 0.115 to 0.125 around t\sim 0.12, above which the structural transition to the LTT phase appears. This indicates that the x_{\rm dip} value is, in principle, \frac{1}{8} also in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} and the origin of x_{\rm dip}\sim0.115 in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} is the result of the existence of two competitive factors.

All the samples were sintered ones prepared by a standard solid-state reaction method mentioned elsewhere. [10] The dc magnetization measurement was carried out using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. The thermal conductivity was measured by the usual steady-state method.

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity \kappa of La_{1.875-y}Nd_{0.125}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}. A small enhancement or kink is observed in \kappa below \sim30 K in the

 samples with 0.115 \approxx\approx0.18, as shown by the arrows. This anomaly of \kappa originates in the structural transition to the LTT phase. Previously, we reported that the structural transition to the LTT phase appears at low temperatures above y^{\sim}^{\sim}^{1} in La_{1.875-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{0.125}CuO_{4} (Ref. [18]) and the enhancement of \kappa below T_{d2} increases with y up to \sim0.2, where it is much larger and more pronounced than those of the present samples with y = 0.125.[19] In the samples with x = 0.11 and 0.2, no anomaly is seen in the temperature dependence of \kappa, which indicates that the structural transition does not exist in these samples.

Figures 2-5 show the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility M/H of La_{1.885-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{0.115}CuO_{4}, La_{1.875-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{0.125}CuO_{4}, La_{2.-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, and La_{1.875-y}Nd_{0.125}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, respectively. These results show that two superconducting transitions exist in La_{2-x-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} above y\sim0.125 and in a narrow x region between 0.115 and 0.135. We define the lower and higher T_{c} as T_{c}^{l} and T_{c}^{k}, respectively. In La_{1.875-y}Nd_{0.125}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, the x value of 0.115 corresponds to the smallest x concentration where the structural transition to the LTT phase appears, as shown in Fig. 1. This indicates that the above anomalous behavior of the M/H-T curve should be attributed to the entrance into the LTT phase. Previously, we showed that the coexistence of the LTT and LT01 regions is inevitable below T_{d2},[18] and we propose that T_{c}^{l} and T_{c}^{k} and the T_{c}^{c}'s of the LTT and LT01 regions, respectively. When T_{d2} is low, a comparable LT01 region coexists with the LTT region below T_{d2} because the distortion around the substituted ion does not extend far. The existence of two superconducting phases is the result of competition between the size of the LTT or LT01 regions and the short superconducting coherence length in the present high-T_{c} cuprates, which depends on x. The present results suggest that the volume fraction of the LTT region increases and that of the LT01 region decreases rapidly with further increase of y above 0.125.

Here, we discuss the possibility of site-selective substitution in the La-Sr or La-Ba system. The ionic radius of Sr^{2+} is larger than that of La^{3+}. Thus, it is expected that each Sr^{2+} ion is substituted in isolation from other Sr^{2+} ions, because

  of the difference of the valence and ionic radius between the La^{3+} and Sr^{2+} ions. When Nd^{3+} ions are doped into the La-Sr system, we expect that S^{2+} and Nd^{3+} ions are substituted as a pair as shown in Fig. 6 because of the smaller ionic radius of Nd^{3+} compared to La^{3+}. This enhances the LTT distortion around the doped ions. This pair may have a tendency to order so as to make the volume fraction of the LTT region maximum when x\!=\!\frac{1}{s}. In La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4}, the ionic radius of Ba^{2+} is much larger than that of La^{3+} compared to that of Sr^{2+} and the local distortion around Ba^{2+} is large enough to induce the structural transition to the LTT phase. On the other hand, in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, the difference of the ionic radius between the Sr^{2+} and La^{3+} ions is not so large that the Sr doping can induce the macroscopic structural transition by itself. However, if Nd^{3+} ions are doped, the local distortion around Sr^{2+} is enhanced by the above proposed pairing substitution and the structural transition is induced. However, in La_{1.75}Nd_{0.125}Sr_{0.125}CuO_{4}, T_{d2} is \sim30 K, which is half of the value of \sim65 K in La_{1.875}Ba_{0.125}CuO_{4}. This means that the range where the local lattice distortion, i.e., the LTT region, around the substituted ion extends is rather smaller in the former than in the latter. Because of this difference, the volume fraction of the LTT region at the lowest temperature may be a few times larger in La_{1.875}Ba_{0.125}CuO_{4} than in La_{1.75}Nd_{0.125}Sr_{0.125}CuO_{4}. In La_{1.875-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{0.125}CuO_{4}, with further increase of y above 0.125, Nd^{3+} ions may be substituted near Sr^{2+} ions in the same LaO layer, which also enhances the local distortion around the Sr^{2+} ions and such a region where the local distortion is large becomes the core of the LTT region. Thus the LTT region expands with further increase of y. In this way, in the La-Sr or La-Ba system, site-selective substitution possibly plays an important role in various physical properties. La-site or Cu-site substitution effects in these systems should be reexamined carefully from this point of view. We note that if both x and y are smaller than \sim0.11, the LTT region is not connected in a whole area of the crystal by percolation.

Figure 7(a) shows the y dependence of T_{c}^{h}, T_{c}^{l}, and T_{d2} of La_{1.885-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{0.115}CuO_{4} and La_{1.875-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{0.125}CuO_{4}. T_{d2} is determined from measurements of \kappa. This figure clearly shows that the superconducting properties are very different below and above y\!\sim\!0.12 between the samples with x\!=\!0.115 and those with x\!=\!0.125. In the small-y region, T_{c}^{h} is higher in the samples with x\!=\!0.125 than in those with x\!=\!0.115. However, T_{c}^{h} of the samples with x\!=\!0.125 begins to decrease with y above \sim\!0.06 and almost coincides with that for x\!=\!0.115 at y\!=\!0.1. Above y\!\sim\!0.115, T_{c}^{l} appears, and is clearly related to the appearance of the LTT phase. Although T_{c}^{h} does not change very much even above y\!\sim\!0.125 in either system, T_{c}^{l} shows a clear difference between these two systems. T_{c}^{l} of the samples with x\!=\!0.125 is lower than for those with x\!=\!0.115 for x\!>\!0.125. This difference should be related to the difference of T_{d2} between the two systems as shown in Fig. 7(a). That is, the existence of the LTT region is the origin of the lower T_{c}^{l} in the samples with x\!=\!0.125 above y\!\sim\!0.12. This is clearly seen in the M/H\!-\!T curves of the y\!=\!0.125 samples with x\!=\!0.115 and 0.125 as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. In this way, the x_{\rm dip} value in La_{2-x-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} changes from 0.115 to 0.125 around y\!\sim\!0.12, which indicates that in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, the x_{\rm dip} value is, in principle, \sharp is in La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4}. Figure 7(b) shows the x dependence of the magnitude of the Meissner volume fraction at 4.2 K of La_{2-x-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (y\!=\!0, 0.125, and 0.14). This figure clearly shows that the Meissner volume fraction exhibits a minimum around x\!\sim\!0.12, which

  is similar to the x dependence of T_{c}^{l} observed for 0.115\approx\pm0.135. Even in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, the minimum of the Meissner volume fraction at 4.2 K is seen around x\sim0.12. This means that even if the system is in the LTO1 phase, the superconducting state is greatly influenced around x\sim0.12. This is more easily seen in the magnetic susceptibility of La_{1.775}Nd_{0.1}Sr_{0.125}CuO_{4}. In this sample, although the macroscopic transition to the LTT phase does not exist, a small kink is observed at \sim22 K in the M/H-T curve, which is a sign of the existence of T_{c}^{l} and suggests the existence of a local LTT region with an appropriate size even in the LTO1 phase.

Next, we discuss the origin of the suppression of T_{c} around x\sim\frac{1}{8}. Which is more important for the anomalous T_{c} suppression: the carrier concentration of x\sim\frac{1}{8} or the lattice distortion induced by Sr or Ba doping with x\sim\frac{1}{8}? The present results show that the superconducting properties change drastically accompanying the appearance of the LTT phase. In the samples with x = 0.125, T_{c} decreases rapidly above y\sim0.06, and above y\sim0.125 T_{c}^{l} is lower than that of the sample with x = 0.115 as shown in Fig. 7(a). It is difficult to imagine that the carrier concentration is changed abruptly by the Nd doping above y\sim0.06 only in the samples with x = 0.125. It is natural to ascribe the change to the enhancement of the lattice distortion induced by the Nd doping, which is larger in the system with x = 0.125 than in the system with x = 0.115. That is, the Sr concentration of x\sim\frac{1}{8} is more important for the T_{c} suppression around x\sim\frac{1}{8} than the carrier concentration of x\sim\frac{1}{8}. We propose that Sr^{2+} ions have a tendency to order as one Sr^{2+} ion for 4\times4 La sites and the LTT region around the Sr^{2+} ion is most easily connected by percolation when x = \frac{1}{8}. The shift of the x_{\rm dip} value from 0.115 to 0.125 caused by the Nd doping indicates the existence of two competitive factors. One suppresses T_{c} the most at x\sim\frac{1}{8} and the other increases T_{c} with increasing x. The origin of the former factor is the existence of the LTT phase whose volume fraction is largest around x\sim\frac{1}{8}. As the origin of the latter factor, the increase of the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation energy \Gamma_{Q} or the superconducting coherence length with an increase of x can be considered. Here, we discuss the importance of the AF spin fluctuation. Kitaoka _et al._ discussed the importance of \Gamma_{Q} based on the results for (T_{1}T)^{-1} of ^{63}Cu in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}. [20] Here, T_{1} is the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time. Tou _et al._ reported that 1/T_{1} of Cu in La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4} increases below T_{d2}, showing a tendency to diverge toward T_{N}\sim35 K in a sample with x = 0.125,[21] which indicates that the AF spin fluctuation is drastically affected by the structural transition around x\sim\frac{1}{8}. These results indicate that \Gamma_{Q} decreases below T_{d2}. The AF ordering is observed only around x = \frac{1}{2} where the volume fraction of the LTT region is largest. In the LTT phase where the LTT and LTO1 regions coexist, \Gamma_{Q} is expected to be smaller in the LTT region than in the LTO1 region. This may be related to the existence of two superconducting transition temperatures T_{c}^{l} and T_{c}^{h} in the present system. That is, T_{c}^{l} and T_{c}^{h} are the T_{c}'s in the LTT and LTO1 regions, respectively. In La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, local LTT regions are expected to exist above x\sim0.11 and are largest at x\sim\frac{1}{8} , and the LTT distortion effect suppressing T_{c} should be largest at x\sim\frac{1}{8}. However, this distortion effect is not very large because of the small difference of the ionic radius between La^{3+} and Sr^{2+} ions. On the other hand, \Gamma_{Q} is expected to increase with x. It is expected that the smaller the x value, the more easily \Gamma_{Q} is affected by the LTT distortion. As a result of these two competing effects, the x_{\rm dip} value is observed around x\sim0.115 in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}. It is noted that when x is smaller than 0.11, the LTT distortion effect is very small as mentioned above. In La_{2-x}-Nd_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} or La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4}, the LTT distortion effect induced by the doped ion is large enough to greatly suppress \Gamma_{Q} at x\sim\frac{1}{8}. In this way, the shift of the x_{\rm dip} value from 0.115 to 0.125 on Nd doping in La_{2-x}-Nd_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} can be understood as the result of the existence of two factors. The x-dependent coherence length may also correlate with the shift of the x_{\rm dip} value.

Recently, the possibility that the stripe correlations of spins and holes play an essential role in the T_{c} suppression around x\sim\frac{1}{8} was discussed based on neutron diffraction experiments on La_{1.6-x}Nd_{0.4}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (x\sim 0.12).[22] At present, we do not know if the same situation is realized in samples with smaller y values, i.e., lower T_{d2}. However, as pointed out by the authors of Ref. [22], even in the LTO1 phase, similar stripe correlations as in the LTT phase can possibly be realized dynamically and the present results should be examined from this point of view. Neutron-scattering experiments on samples with low T_{d2} in La_{2-x-y}Nd_{y}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} are desirable.
