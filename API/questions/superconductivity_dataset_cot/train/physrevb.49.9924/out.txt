###### Abstract

We have improved a microwave self-resonant technique to measure surface resistance R_{s} directly and surface inductance L_{s} indirectly. For films prepared by the laser ablation technique we observed that R_{s} at 21 GHz decreased by about three orders of magnitude as the temperature decreased from 90 to 80 K reaching a low value of 4.9 x 10-4 O. We measured the London penetration depth l and coherence length x, and found that both l and x are anisotropic. Their values depended on the direction of the microwave electric field relative to the c axis. We deduced the value of l1(0) to be about 1800 A, l1(86.5) about 8000 A, and l2(86.5) about 26 000 A, where l1(0) is the penetration depth (as T - 0 K) for the electromagnetic electric field parallel and l1 perpendicular to the film plane. In addition x1 was determined to be 129 A and x1 equal to 40 A at 86.5 K. The anisotropic factor g is about 3.

## I Introduction

Since the discovery of superconductivity in high-_T__c_ materials,1 the measured value of the surface resistance R_{s} of Y-Ba-Cu-O at microwave frequencies has decreased steadily.2-7 The reduction in R_{s} is a reflection on the improved quality of films and measurement capabilities. The implication from recent measurements2,5-7 is that the intrinsic limits of R_{s} and related parameters are within the limit of measurability with present techniques. As such, we believe that it is timely now to infer fundamental properties of the superconducting state of Y-Ba-Cu-O from measurements of R_{s} and related parameters.

In this paper we improve upon a microwave self-resonant (MSR) technique to measure R_{s} directly and L_{s}, the surface inductance, indirectly. From R_{s} and L_{s}, we deduce the London penetration depth l, and the coherence length x. Also, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques are used to deduce l and x. We compare the MSR technique with conventional coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator and waveguide cavity techniques in the measurements of R_{s}. The microwave measurements were correlated with dc field measurements using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) apparatus. These sets of measurements provided a consistent set of measurements which formed the basis of our study: the measurement of the fundamental length scales of Y-Ba-Cu-O in the superconducting state.

We determined that both l and x are anisotropic. Their values depended on the direction of the microwave electric field relative to the c axis. We determined the anisotropy factor to be about 3. This result was in good agreement with other published results.8-10,31,32 The significant information reported here is the quantitative measure of both l and x. It appears that the value of l1(0) is about 1800 A, where l1 is defined as the penetration depth parallel to the film plane or perpendicular to the c axis. l1(86.5) is measured by us to be equal to 26 000 A.

We also report x1 and x1, where x1 is defined as the coherence length applicable for the electric field (or current) applied along the _a_-_b_ plane and x1 is along the c axis. At T = 86.5 K, x1 = 129 A and x1 = 40 A. The microwave techniques used here are not able to deduce x below 77 K, since the B field internal to the film was approximately constant below this temperature. The coherence length usually is deduced from the measurement of upper critical magnetic field _H__c_2.8-10 However, _H__c_2 of Y-Ba-Cu-O is extremely high; the measurement requires special and difficult techniques.

In Sec. II, we discuss the sample preparation and characterization. In Sec. III we discuss our measurement technique to measure R_{s} and L_{s}. Comparison of our techniques with others is given in Sec. IV. The experimental results are discussed in Sec. V, followed by discussions and conclusions.

## II Sample preparation and characterization

Pulsed laser ablation was used to deposit films of YBa2Cu3O7-b. The deposition technique may be briefly described. The output of a Lambda Physik model 315 excimer laser operating at 248 nm (KrF) was focused with a 50-cm-focal-length lens to an energy density of 1.5 J/cm2 onto a stoichiometric YBa2Cu3O7-8 target. The targets were commercially purchased and were specified to be 99.999% pure. The ablated material was deposited onto a heated (100)-oriented MgO substrate positioned ~4 cm from the target. The substrate was held at 750 degC in 300 mTorr of oxygen atmosphere during the deposition and then quenched to room temperature in 1 atm of oxygen. The deposition rate was ~1 A/pulse over a 1-cm2 substrate area. The film thickness was measured using a Dektak mechanical transducer, and typically we obtained ~5000-A-thick films. The room-temperature resistivity of the films was about 300 _m_tD cm. The transition temperature was measured using the four-probe method, and typical T_{c} was about 90 K; the transition width was about 0.5 K. These results were fairly reproducible from run to run. In our characterization studies, as many as 10-156 sample films were used for our investigation. We defined T_{c} as the temperature at which the resistance was half of the onset value. The dc transport measurements were made inductively using a multiturn coil pressed against the film to induce surface currents. Changes in the coil's inductance and the third harmonic of the driving voltage were used to determine J_{c}. [11] The current densities exceeded 106 A/cm2 at 77 K. X-ray diffraction indicated that the films were oriented with the c axis normal to the substrate surface. The reader is referred to Ref. [12] for actual display of x-ray data of our film. Pole figure analysis of (012) peaks, for similar films, indicated a continuum of _a_-_b_ in-plane misorientations peaked strongly at 90deg and a much lesser extent at 45deg. Scanning tunneling microscope (STM) analysis indicates a surface roughness of the order of <500 A (see Fig. 1).

## III Microwave Experimental Techniques

### Microwave self-resonant technique

This technique was initially reported by Skrehot and Chang [13] to measure the ratio of surface resistance of a superconductor and characteristic impedance of a waveguide at resonant frequency. In Ref. [13] an analysis was developed only at the resonant frequency. We have extended the analysis to be applicable at resonance as well as off resonance. As a result, R_{s}, L_{s}, C, and Z0 were determined uniquely from our analysis, where R_{s} is the surface resistance of the superconducting strip, L_{s} is the surface inductance due to the superconducting screening currents, C is the capacitance due to the gap between the strip and the waveguide, and Z0 is the characteristic impedance of the waveguide. From these parameters the penetration depth and coherence length of the superconducting films were deduced. A thin-film strip (4.24 x 0.9 mm2) of Y-Ba-Cu-O was placed in a waveguide whose cross section was 10.67 x 4.32 mm2 as shown in Fig. 2. The thickness of the film was typically 0.5 _m_m. The equivalent circuit of the strip and waveguide transmission line is also shown in Fig. 2. A typical gap value was 0.04 mm, and it corresponded to C  10-12 f. No systematic study was made to relate the gap width with C. However, besides the gap the dielectric constant of the substrate on which the Y-Ba-Cu-O film was deposited affected the value of C. We empirically varied the width of the gap until the transmission microwave resonance was observed between 18 and 26 GHz, the fundamental band of propagation in the waveguide.

The inductance L was a combination of the superconductor intrinsic inductance L_{s} and the self inductance L0, calculated approximately as14

Figure 2: Schematic of microwave self-resonant experiment and equivalent circuit of the MSR measurement.

Figure 1: STM micrograph of a superconducting film. The vertical and horizontal axes are in units of mm; each division is 200 nm.

  \[L_{0} \simeq \frac{Z_{0}}{2\pi f_{0}}\frac{a}{b}\frac{f}{\sqrt{f_{c}^{2} -f^{2}}}\left[\sin\frac{3\pi}{2}\left[\frac{\sin x}{x}\right]\right]^{2}\left[1 - \frac{w}{a}\right]\ ,\]

where

\[x = \frac{3\pi}{2}\frac{w}{a}\ ,\ \ f_{c} = \frac{3c}{2a}\ ,\]

and

\[w = 0.9\ \mathrm{mm}\ ,\ \ a = 10.67\ \mathrm{mm}\ ,\ \ b = 4.32\ \mathrm{mm}\ .\]

f_{0} is the transmission resonant frequency, and c is the speed of light. A typical value of L_{0} was ~10-11 H. In comparison to L_{0}, L_{s} was about a factor of 100 lower.

From the equivalent circuit of Fig. 2, the reflection S_{11} and transmission S_{21} coefficients may be calculated as follows:

\[S_{11} = -\left[\frac{2Z}{Z_{0}} + 1\right]^{-1} = |S_{11}|e^{j\phi_{11}}\]

and

\[S_{21} = \left[\frac{Z_{0}}{2Z} + 1\right]^{-1} = |S_{21}|e^{j\phi_{21}}\ ,\]

where \phi_{11} and \phi_{21} are the phase angles of S_{11} and S_{21}. For the equivalent circuit of Fig. 2,

\[Z = R_{s} + i\left[\omega L - \frac{1}{\omega C}\right]\ ;\]

putting (4) into (3), we get

\[S_{21} = \frac{(\omega/\omega_{0})R_{s}\sqrt{C/L} \ + i[(\omega/\omega_{0})^{2} - 1\ ]}{(\omega/\omega_{0})(R_{s} + Z_{0}/2)\sqrt{C/L}\ + i[(\omega/\omega_{0})^{2} - 1\ ]}\ ,\]

where

\[\omega_{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}\]

is the transmission resonant frequency. Letting

\[y = \frac{\omega}{\omega_{0}}\ ,\]

\[\gamma^{2} = \frac{C}{L}R_{s}^{2}\ ,\]

and

\[\eta^{2} = \frac{C}{L}\left[\frac{Z_{0}}{2}\right]^{2}\ ,\]

(5) can be written as

\[S_{21} = \frac{\gamma y + i(y^{2} - 1)}{(\gamma + \eta)y + i(y^{2} - 1)}\ .\]

The amplitude and phase are, respectively (we used |S_{21}|^{2} instead of |S_{21}| for simplifying the fitting procedure),

\[P = |S_{21}|^{2} = \frac{\gamma^{2}y^{2} + (y^{2} - 1)^{2}}{y^{2}(\gamma + \eta)^{2} + (y^{2} - 1)^{2}}\ ,\]

\[\phi_{21} = \tan^{- 1}\left[\frac{1 - y^{2}}{\gamma y}\ \right] - \tan^{- 1}\left[\frac{1 - y^{2}}{(\gamma + \eta y)}\ \right]\ .\]

By fitting the experimental curves, the parameters \gamma and \eta and, therefore R_{s} and L can be deduced. At resonant frequency, the imaginary part vanishes; hence Z = R_{s}. R_{s} may be determined from (3) directly,

\[R_{s} = \frac{Z_{0}}{2[1/|S_{21}| - 1\ ]}\ .\]

It is noted that in (13) there is no other loss parameter in the expression. Loss tangents of the substrate have minimal effects on the measurement of R_{s}. For example, we have included realistic loss tangents for a typical substrate material of MgO or SrTiO_{3}, etc., and calculated |S_{21}|. The correction to R_{s} [using (13)] from the loss tangent contribution was calculated to be about 0.04% at 80 K (using MgO as an example).

The surface impedance Z for a finite-thickness strip is determined from

\[Z = - jZ_{\infty}\cot\left[\frac{\omega\mu_{0}d}{Z_{\infty}}\right]\ .\]

The subscript \infty is to denote that as d \rightarrow \infty, Z \rightarrow Z_{\infty};

\[Z_{\infty} = R_{s} + i\left[\omega L - \frac{1}{\omega C}\ \right]\ .\]

As in any development of a new technique, we calibrated the measurement with standard materials, such as films of copper, silver, etc. We placed strips of copper, silver, aluminum, and bulk Y-Ba-Cu-O in the waveguide for the purpose of determining Z_{0} and to measure the conductivity of each material. Z_{0} determined from calibration runs was 43 \Omega. Conceivably, L_{0} could have been determined from the calibration runs, since L_{0} was not a property of the superconducting material. However, this would require identical strip dimensions and substrate material for both Y-Ba-Cu-O and the reference material. Instead, we determined L_{0} from f_{0} and line-shape fitting of |S_{21}| versus frequency for each run under consideration.

The limitation of this technique was dependent on the sensitivity of the HP8510 network analyzer. For example, by amplifying the transmitted signal with a 20-dB amplifier, the sensitivity of the technique can be improved so that a surface resistance as small as 20 \mu\Omega can be measured.

### EPR absorption technique

Normally, in an EPR measurement technique, dP/dH is measured,[15] where P is the microwave power absorbed by the sample in question and H is the magnetic field. The EPR technique was used[15] in the past to measure dP/dH at low-H fields on superconducting high-T_{c} materials. This technique was often referred to in the litera  ture[16] as the "magnetically modulated microwave absorption," (MMMA) technique. We introduced this technique to measure _dP_ /_dH_ in 1987 (Ref. 16) in order to measure T_{c} of very fine particle of Y-Ba-Cu-O. In that experiment _dP_ /_dH_ was measured as a function of temperature. Since the introduction of that technique, we have developed an analysis of the line shape of _dP_ /_dH_ as a function of H to deduce l1/_ξ_1 and l1. A superconducting sample of Y-Ba-Cu-O was placed inside a microwave cavity and allowed to cool down below T_{c}. By sweeping the external magnetic field between +-200 Oe, _dP_ /_dH_ was measured as a function of H.

For a single fluxoid core region in a type-II superconductor, P1 is given as

\[P_{1} = \sigma_{n}E_{0}^{2}\pi\xi^{2}t\ ,\]

where s_{n} is the normal conductivity and E0 is the external microwave electric field along the fluxoid axis (which is normal to the film). _ξ_ is the coherence length, and t is the film thickness. For a long cylinder, such as a fluxoid in which the diameter to length ratio is small, the external and internal electric fields are equal, since the depolarization factor is zero. If there are more fluxoids and one can assume a square lattice of fluxoids, then the total power absorbed is simply

\[P = NP_{1} = {{A} \over {D^{2}}}P_{1}\ ,\]

where A is the total area of the film and D is the flux lattice constant. As it is well known,[17] D is related to B, the magnetic flux density, by the relationship

\[{{1} \over {D^{2}}} = {{|B|} \over {\phi_{0}}}\ .\]

Thus Eq. (17) becomes

\[P = (A\,\sigma_{0}E_{0}^{2}\pi t/\phi_{0})\xi^{2}|B| = C_{1}\xi^{2}|B|\ .\]

In the superconducting region, the microwave electric field, relative to E0, is reduced by a factor of _s__s_/_ω_θ  measure the appropriate microwave quantity, what is the lowest value of R_{s} that one can deduce from a given technique?

For techniques similar to the CPW technique, such as stripline and microstrip, the reader is referred to Refs. 19-21. Surface resistances determined from these techniques are dependent on the quality factor Q and frequency, R_{s} \sim \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!  sured with respect to the resonant frequency at 4 K (see Fig. 4). L_{s} at 4 K can also be deduced from the surface resistance R_{s}. Since R_{s} = \frac{1}{2}\mu_{0}^{2}\sigma_{n}\omega^{2}\lambda^{3} and X_{s} = \omega L_{s} = \omega\mu_{0}\lambda,

\[L_{s} = \left[ \frac{2\mu_{0}R_{s}}{\omega^{2}\sigma_{n}} \right]^{1/3}.\] (31)

This served as a reference point for the rest of the data of L_{s} at higher temperatures.

In Fig. 5, R_{s} and L_{s} are plotted as a function of temperature, R_{s} decreased by about three orders of magnitude as the temperature decreased from 90 to 80 K, reaching a low value of 4.9 x 10-4 O. At 15 K, R_{s} was 2.7 x 10-4 O, the lowest value measured using the MSR method. If we extrapolate5R_{s} to lower frequencies, we find that R_{s} is equivalent to 100 \mu\Omega at 10 GHz and 8.7 \mu\Omega at 2.95 GHz. The temperature is assumed to be equal to 77 K. However, at 15 K, the extrapolated values would be 61 \mu\Omega at 10 GHz and 5.3 \mu\Omega at 2.95 GHz. A comparison with other measurements of R_{s} is given in Tables 2 and 3. We note that our measured values of R_{s} exhibit an oscillating behavior with temperature, although L_{s} does not. We do not attribute the oscillatory behavior of R_{s} to an intrinsic process, since lower values of R_{s} have been measured at lower frequencies (10 GHz) (Refs. 3 and 4) and no oscillatory behavior of R_{s} was observed.

Assuming that the surface impedance is of the form

\[Z_{s} = R_{s} + j\omega L_{s} = j\omega\mu_{0}\left[ \lambda^{2} - j\left( \frac{\rho_{n}}{\mu_{0}\omega} \right) \right]^{1/2},\] (32)

we can solve for \lambda and \rho_{n} and obtain the relations:

\[\lambda = \frac{1}{\mu_{0}\omega}\sqrt{X_{s}^{2} - R_{s}^{2}}\] (33)

and

\[\rho_{n} = \frac{2}{\mu_{0}\omega}X_{s}R_{s}\ .\] (34)

In Fig. 6 we plot \lambda as a function of temperature. Typical  

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} Technique & R_{s} (\mu\Omega) & L_{s} (10^{-13}h) & \lambda (Å) & f (GHz) & Sample & Reference \\

Shown in Fig. 7 are measured and calculated dP/dH as a function of H. In this fit, we deduced \lambda = 26\,000 A and \xi = 40 A at 86.5 K. However, a clear distinction is to be pointed out here. Data for \lambda generated in MSR and CPW resonator measurements assume the microwave electric field to be parallel to the film plane. We denote them as \lambda_{\parallel}. For the MMMA case, the data are denoted as \lambda_{\parallel}, since the microwave electric field is parallel to the c axis. The same definitions for \xi_{\parallel} and \xi_{\perp} apply. The anisotropy in \lambda and \xi was most conveniently described by an anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa, and it was defined as [27, 28]

\[\kappa_{\perp} = \lambda_{\parallel}/\xi_{\parallel}\ ,\] (36) \[\kappa_{\parallel} = (\lambda_{\parallel}\lambda_{\perp})^{1/2}/(\xi_{\parallel}\xi_{ \parallel})^{1/2}\ .\] (37)

The anisotropy of these parameters are determined by the anisotropy factor \gamma,

\[\kappa_{\parallel} = \gamma\kappa_{\perp}\ ,\] (38) \[\xi_{\parallel} = \gamma\xi_{\perp}\ ,\] (39)

and

\[\lambda_{\  we have tried to obtain consistent quantitative results. Specifically, we have determined that for the current density **J**, the direction perpendicular to the c axis, \xi_{\parallel}, is 129 A at 86.5 K and extrapolates to 25 A at 0 K if we use the relationship \xi(T) = \xi(0)(1 - T/T_{c})^{- 1/2}. For **J** along the c axis, \xi_{\perp} is 40 A at 86.5 K and extrapolates to 8 A at 0 K.

A summary of the measured characterizing parameters of a Y-Ba-Cu-O film are given in Table 4.2 in comparison with others' results. Umezawa _et al_. [8] and Worthington, Gallagher, and Dinger [9] measured the penetration depth and coherence length in both the c and a-b directions. From their results, one concluded an anisotropic factor \gamma of 3-5; however, their measured penetration depths \lambda's at 0 K were smaller than the \lambda's measured by others [31]^{- 35} and us. Harshman _et al_. [31] measured the penetration depth along both directions, but no coherence length data were obtained. \lambda_{\parallel} and \xi_{\parallel} reported in Refs. [32]^{- 34} were consistent; they measured \lambda_{\parallel} = 1400 A and \xi_{\parallel} = 20 \sim 22 A. However, no data along the c-axis direction were available for comparison.

We do not believe that the above values of \xi's we obtained represent their intrinsic limit. This is because we measured \lambda_{\parallel} \simeq 1800 A at 4 K; however, many groups [31]^{- 33} have reported \lambda_{\parallel}(0) to be about 1400 A. If we assume the latter value of \lambda_{\parallel} to be intrinsic, we extrapolate the following values for \xi_{\parallel} and \xi_{\perp}, respectively, at 0 K: 19 and 6 A.

###### Abstract

We have improved a microwave self-resonant technique to measure surface resistance R_{s} directly and surface inductance L_{s} indirectly. For films prepared by the laser ablation technique we observed that R_{s} at 21 GHz decreased by about three orders of magnitude as the temperature decreased from 90 to 80 K reaching a low value of 4.9 x 10-4 O. We measured the London penetration depth l and coherence length x, and found that both l and x are anisotropic. Their values depended on the direction of the microwave electric field relative to the c axis. We deduced the value of l1(0) to be about 1800 A, l1(86.5) about 8000 A, and l2(86.5) about 26 000 A, where l1(0) is the penetration depth (as T - 0 K) for the electromagnetic electric field parallel and l1 perpendicular to the film plane. In addition x1 was determined to be 129 A and x1 equal to 40 A at 86.5 K. The anisotropic factor g is about 3.

Since the discovery of superconductivity in high-_T__c_ materials,1 the measured value of the surface resistance R_{s} of Y-Ba-Cu-O at microwave frequencies has decreased steadily.2-7 The reduction in R_{s} is a reflection on the improved quality of films and measurement capabilities. The implication from recent measurements2,5-7 is that the intrinsic limits of R_{s} and related parameters are within the limit of measurability with present techniques. As such, we believe that it is timely now to infer fundamental properties of the superconducting state of Y-Ba-Cu-O from measurements of R_{s} and related parameters.

In this paper we improve upon a microwave self-resonant (MSR) technique to measure R_{s} directly and L_{s}, the surface inductance, indirectly. From R_{s} and L_{s}, we deduce the London penetration depth l, and the coherence length x. Also, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques are used to deduce l and x. We compare the MSR technique with conventional coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator and waveguide cavity techniques in the measurements of R_{s}. The microwave measurements were correlated with dc field measurements using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) apparatus. These sets of measurements provided a consistent set of measurements which formed the basis of our study: the measurement of the fundamental length scales of Y-Ba-Cu-O in the superconducting state.

We determined that both l and x are anisotropic. Their values depended on the direction of the microwave electric field relative to the c axis. We determined the anisotropy factor to be about 3. This result was in good agreement with other published results.8-10,31,32 The significant information reported here is the quantitative measure of both l and x. It appears that the value of l1(0) is about 1800 A, where l1 is defined as the penetration depth parallel to the film plane or perpendicular to the c axis. l1(86.5) is measured by us to be equal to 26 000 A.

We also report x1 and x1, where x1 is defined as the coherence length applicable for the electric field (or current) applied along the _a_-_b_ plane and x1 is along the c axis. At T = 86.5 K, x1 = 129 A and x1 = 40 A. The microwave techniques used here are not able to deduce x below 77 K, since the B field internal to the film was approximately constant below this temperature. The coherence length usually is deduced from the measurement of upper critical magnetic field _H__c_2.8-10 However, _H__c_2 of Y-Ba-Cu-O is extremely high; the measurement requires special and difficult techniques.

In Sec. II, we discuss the sample preparation and characterization. In Sec. III we discuss our measurement technique to measure R_{s} and L_{s}. Comparison of our techniques with others is given in Sec. IV. The experimental results are discussed in Sec. V, followed by discussions and conclusions.

## II Sample preparation and characterization

Pulsed laser ablation was used to deposit films of YBa2Cu3O7-b. The deposition technique may be briefly described. The output of a Lambda Physik model 315 excimer laser operating at 248 nm (KrF) was focused with a 50-cm-focal-length lens to an energy density of 1.5 J/cm2 onto a stoichiometric YBa2Cu3O7-8 target. The targets were commercially purchased and were specified to be 99.999% pure. The ablated material was deposited onto a heated (100)-oriented MgO substrate positioned ~4 cm from the target. The substrate was held at 750 degC in 300 mTorr of oxygen atmosphere during the deposition and then quenched to room temperature in 1 atm of oxygen. The deposition rate was ~1 A/pulse over a 1-cm2 substrate area. The film thickness was measured using a Dektak mechanical transducer, and typically we obtained ~5000-A-thick films. The room-temperature resistivity of the films was about 300 _m_tD cm. The transition temperature was measured using the four-probe method, and typical T_{c} was about 90 K; the transition width was about 0.5 K. These results were fairly reproducible from run to run. In our characterization studies, as many as 10-156 sample films were used for our investigation. We defined T_{c} as the temperature at which the resistance was half of the onset value. The dc transport measurements were made inductively using a multiturn coil pressed against the film to induce surface currents. Changes in the coil's inductance and the third harmonic of the driving voltage were used to determine J_{c}. [11] The current densities exceeded 106 A/cm2 at 77 K. X-ray diffraction indicated that the films were oriented with the c axis normal to the substrate surface. The reader is referred to Ref. [12] for actual display of x-ray data of our film. Pole figure analysis of (012) peaks, for similar films, indicated a continuum of _a_-_b_ in-plane misorientations peaked strongly at 90deg and a much lesser extent at 45deg. Scanning tunneling microscope (STM) analysis indicates a surface roughness of the order of <500 A (see Fig. 1).

## III Microwave Experimental Techniques

### Microwave self-resonant technique

This technique was initially reported by Skrehot and Chang [13] to measure the ratio of surface resistance of a superconductor and characteristic impedance of a waveguide at resonant frequency. In Ref. [13] an analysis was developed only at the resonant frequency. We have extended the analysis to be applicable at resonance as well as off resonance. As a result, R_{s}, L_{s}, C, and Z0 were determined uniquely from our analysis, where R_{s} is the surface resistance of the superconducting strip, L_{s} is the surface inductance due to the superconducting screening currents, C is the capacitance due to the gap between the strip and the waveguide, and Z0 is the characteristic impedance of the waveguide. From these parameters the penetration depth and coherence length of the superconducting films were deduced. A thin-film strip (4.24 x 0.9 mm2) of Y-Ba-Cu-O was placed in a waveguide whose cross section was 10.67 x 4.32 mm2 as shown in Fig. 2. The thickness of the film was typically 0.5 _m_m. The equivalent circuit of the strip and waveguide transmission line is also shown in Fig. 2. A typical gap value was 0.04 mm, and it corresponded to C  10-12 f. No systematic study was made to relate the gap width with C. However, besides the gap the dielectric constant of the substrate on which the Y-Ba-Cu-O film was deposited affected the value of C. We empirically varied the width of the gap until the transmission microwave resonance was observed between 18 and 26 GHz, the fundamental band of propagation in the waveguide.

The inductance L was a combination of the superconductor intrinsic inductance L_{s} and the self inductance L0, calculated approximately as14

Figure 2: Schematic of microwave self-resonant experiment and equivalent circuit of the MSR measurement.

Figure 1: STM micrograph of a superconducting film. The vertical and horizontal axes are in units of mm; each division is 200 nm.

  \[L_{0} \simeq \frac{Z_{0}}{2\pi f_{0}}\frac{a}{b}\frac{f}{\sqrt{f_{c}^{2} -f^{2}}}\left[\sin\frac{3\pi}{2}\left[\frac{\sin x}{x}\right]\right]^{2}\left[1 - \frac{w}{a}\right]\ ,\]

where

\[x = \frac{3\pi}{2}\frac{w}{a}\ ,\ \ f_{c} = \frac{3c}{2a}\ ,\]

and

\[w = 0.9\ \mathrm{mm}\ ,\ \ a = 10.67\ \mathrm{mm}\ ,\ \ b = 4.32\ \mathrm{mm}\ .\]

f_{0} is the transmission resonant frequency, and c is the speed of light. A typical value of L_{0} was ~10-11 H. In comparison to L_{0}, L_{s} was about a factor of 100 lower.

From the equivalent circuit of Fig. 2, the reflection S_{11} and transmission S_{21} coefficients may be calculated as follows:

\[S_{11} = -\left[\frac{2Z}{Z_{0}} + 1\right]^{-1} = |S_{11}|e^{j\phi_{11}}\]

and

\[S_{21} = \left[\frac{Z_{0}}{2Z} + 1\right]^{-1} = |S_{21}|e^{j\phi_{21}}\ ,\]

where \phi_{11} and \phi_{21} are the phase angles of S_{11} and S_{21}. For the equivalent circuit of Fig. 2,

\[Z = R_{s} + i\left[\omega L - \frac{1}{\omega C}\right]\ ;\]

putting (4) into (3), we get

\[S_{21} = \frac{(\omega/\omega_{0})R_{s}\sqrt{C/L} \ + i[(\omega/\omega_{0})^{2} - 1\ ]}{(\omega/\omega_{0})(R_{s} + Z_{0}/2)\sqrt{C/L}\ + i[(\omega/\omega_{0})^{2} - 1\ ]}\ ,\]

where

\[\omega_{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}\]

is the transmission resonant frequency. Letting

\[y = \frac{\omega}{\omega_{0}}\ ,\]

\[\gamma^{2} = \frac{C}{L}R_{s}^{2}\ ,\]

and

\[\eta^{2} = \frac{C}{L}\left[\frac{Z_{0}}{2}\right]^{2}\ ,\]

(5) can be written as

\[S_{21} = \frac{\gamma y + i(y^{2} - 1)}{(\gamma + \eta)y + i(y^{2} - 1)}\ .\]

The amplitude and phase are, respectively (we used |S_{21}|^{2} instead of |S_{21}| for simplifying the fitting procedure),

\[P = |S_{21}|^{2} = \frac{\gamma^{2}y^{2} + (y^{2} - 1)^{2}}{y^{2}(\gamma + \eta)^{2} + (y^{2} - 1)^{2}}\ ,\]

\[\phi_{21} = \tan^{- 1}\left[\frac{1 - y^{2}}{\gamma y}\ \right] - \tan^{- 1}\left[\frac{1 - y^{2}}{(\gamma + \eta y)}\ \right]\ .\]

By fitting the experimental curves, the parameters \gamma and \eta and, therefore R_{s} and L can be deduced. At resonant frequency, the imaginary part vanishes; hence Z = R_{s}. R_{s} may be determined from (3) directly,

\[R_{s} = \frac{Z_{0}}{2[1/|S_{21}| - 1\ ]}\ .\]

It is noted that in (13) there is no other loss parameter in the expression. Loss tangents of the substrate have minimal effects on the measurement of R_{s}. For example, we have included realistic loss tangents for a typical substrate material of MgO or SrTiO_{3}, etc., and calculated |S_{21}|. The correction to R_{s} [using (13)] from the loss tangent contribution was calculated to be about 0.04% at 80 K (using MgO as an example).

The surface impedance Z for a finite-thickness strip is determined from

\[Z = - jZ_{\infty}\cot\left[\frac{\omega\mu_{0}d}{Z_{\infty}}\right]\ .\]

The subscript \infty is to denote that as d \rightarrow \infty, Z \rightarrow Z_{\infty};

\[Z_{\infty} = R_{s} + i\left[\omega L - \frac{1}{\omega C}\ \right]\ .\]

As in any development of a new technique, we calibrated the measurement with standard materials, such as films of copper, silver, etc. We placed strips of copper, silver, aluminum, and bulk Y-Ba-Cu-O in the waveguide for the purpose of determining Z_{0} and to measure the conductivity of each material. Z_{0} determined from calibration runs was 43 \Omega. Conceivably, L_{0} could have been determined from the calibration runs, since L_{0} was not a property of the superconducting material. However, this would require identical strip dimensions and substrate material for both Y-Ba-Cu-O and the reference material. Instead, we determined L_{0} from f_{0} and line-shape fitting of |S_{21}| versus frequency for each run under consideration.

The limitation of this technique was dependent on the sensitivity of the HP8510 network analyzer. For example, by amplifying the transmitted signal with a 20-dB amplifier, the sensitivity of the technique can be improved so that a surface resistance as small as 20 \mu\Omega can be measured.

### EPR absorption technique

Normally, in an EPR measurement technique, dP/dH is measured,[15] where P is the microwave power absorbed by the sample in question and H is the magnetic field. The EPR technique was used[15] in the past to measure dP/dH at low-H fields on superconducting high-T_{c} materials. This technique was often referred to in the litera  ture[16] as the "magnetically modulated microwave absorption," (MMMA) technique. We introduced this technique to measure _dP_ /_dH_ in 1987 (Ref. 16) in order to measure T_{c} of very fine particle of Y-Ba-Cu-O. In that experiment _dP_ /_dH_ was measured as a function of temperature. Since the introduction of that technique, we have developed an analysis of the line shape of _dP_ /_dH_ as a function of H to deduce l1/_ξ_1 and l1. A superconducting sample of Y-Ba-Cu-O was placed inside a microwave cavity and allowed to cool down below T_{c}. By sweeping the external magnetic field between +-200 Oe, _dP_ /_dH_ was measured as a function of H.

For a single fluxoid core region in a type-II superconductor, P1 is given as

\[P_{1} = \sigma_{n}E_{0}^{2}\pi\xi^{2}t\ ,\]

where s_{n} is the normal conductivity and E0 is the external microwave electric field along the fluxoid axis (which is normal to the film). _ξ_ is the coherence length, and t is the film thickness. For a long cylinder, such as a fluxoid in which the diameter to length ratio is small, the external and internal electric fields are equal, since the depolarization factor is zero. If there are more fluxoids and one can assume a square lattice of fluxoids, then the total power absorbed is simply

\[P = NP_{1} = {{A} \over {D^{2}}}P_{1}\ ,\]

where A is the total area of the film and D is the flux lattice constant. As it is well known,[17] D is related to B, the magnetic flux density, by the relationship

\[{{1} \over {D^{2}}} = {{|B|} \over {\phi_{0}}}\ .\]

Thus Eq. (17) becomes

\[P = (A\,\sigma_{0}E_{0}^{2}\pi t/\phi_{0})\xi^{2}|B| = C_{1}\xi^{2}|B|\ .\]

In the superconducting region, the microwave electric field, relative to E0, is reduced by a factor of _s__s_/_ω_θ  measure the appropriate microwave quantity, what is the lowest value of R_{s} that one can deduce from a given technique?

For techniques similar to the CPW technique, such as stripline and microstrip, the reader is referred to Refs. 19-21. Surface resistances determined from these techniques are dependent on the quality factor Q and frequency, R_{s} \sim \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!  sured with respect to the resonant frequency at 4 K (see Fig. 4). L_{s} at 4 K can also be deduced from the surface resistance R_{s}. Since R_{s} = \frac{1}{2}\mu_{0}^{2}\sigma_{n}\omega^{2}\lambda^{3} and X_{s} = \omega L_{s} = \omega\mu_{0}\lambda,

\[L_{s} = \left[ \frac{2\mu_{0}R_{s}}{\omega^{2}\sigma_{n}} \right]^{1/3}.\] (31)

This served as a reference point for the rest of the data of L_{s} at higher temperatures.

In Fig. 5, R_{s} and L_{s} are plotted as a function of temperature, R_{s} decreased by about three orders of magnitude as the temperature decreased from 90 to 80 K, reaching a low value of 4.9 x 10-4 O. At 15 K, R_{s} was 2.7 x 10-4 O, the lowest value measured using the MSR method. If we extrapolate5R_{s} to lower frequencies, we find that R_{s} is equivalent to 100 \mu\Omega at 10 GHz and 8.7 \mu\Omega at 2.95 GHz. The temperature is assumed to be equal to 77 K. However, at 15 K, the extrapolated values would be 61 \mu\Omega at 10 GHz and 5.3 \mu\Omega at 2.95 GHz. A comparison with other measurements of R_{s} is given in Tables 2 and 3. We note that our measured values of R_{s} exhibit an oscillating behavior with temperature, although L_{s} does not. We do not attribute the oscillatory behavior of R_{s} to an intrinsic process, since lower values of R_{s} have been measured at lower frequencies (10 GHz) (Refs. 3 and 4) and no oscillatory behavior of R_{s} was observed.

Assuming that the surface impedance is of the form

\[Z_{s} = R_{s} + j\omega L_{s} = j\omega\mu_{0}\left[ \lambda^{2} - j\left( \frac{\rho_{n}}{\mu_{0}\omega} \right) \right]^{1/2},\] (32)

we can solve for \lambda and \rho_{n} and obtain the relations:

\[\lambda = \frac{1}{\mu_{0}\omega}\sqrt{X_{s}^{2} - R_{s}^{2}}\] (33)

and

\[\rho_{n} = \frac{2}{\mu_{0}\omega}X_{s}R_{s}\ .\] (34)

In Fig. 6 we plot \lambda as a function of temperature. Typical  

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} Technique & R_{s} (\mu\Omega) & L_{s} (10^{-13}h) & \lambda (Å) & f (GHz) & Sample & Reference \\
480a & 2.33 & 1800 & 21 & & our \\ A & 108b & & & 10 & film & MSR \\

Shown in Fig. 7 are measured and calculated dP/dH as a function of H. In this fit, we deduced \lambda = 26\,000 A and \xi = 40 A at 86.5 K. However, a clear distinction is to be pointed out here. Data for \lambda generated in MSR and CPW resonator measurements assume the microwave electric field to be parallel to the film plane. We denote them as \lambda_{\parallel}. For the MMMA case, the data are denoted as \lambda_{\parallel}, since the microwave electric field is parallel to the c axis. The same definitions for \xi_{\parallel} and \xi_{\perp} apply. The anisotropy in \lambda and \xi was most conveniently described by an anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa, and it was defined as [27, 28]

\[\kappa_{\perp} = \lambda_{\parallel}/\xi_{\parallel}\ ,\] (36) \[\kappa_{\parallel} = (\lambda_{\parallel}\lambda_{\perp})^{1/2}/(\xi_{\parallel}\xi_{ \parallel})^{1/2}\ .\] (37)

The anisotropy of these parameters are determined by the anisotropy factor \gamma,

\[\kappa_{\parallel} = \gamma\kappa_{\perp}\ ,\] (38) \[\xi_{\parallel} = \gamma\xi_{\perp}\ ,\] (39)

and

\[\lambda_{\  we have tried to obtain consistent quantitative results. Specifically, we have determined that for the current density **J**, the direction perpendicular to the c axis, \xi_{\parallel}, is 129 A at 86.5 K and extrapolates to 25 A at 0 K if we use the relationship \xi(T) = \xi(0)(1 - T/T_{c})^{- 1/2}. For **J** along the c axis, \xi_{\perp} is 40 A at 86.5 K and extrapolates to 8 A at 0 K.

A summary of the measured characterizing parameters of a Y-Ba-Cu-O film are given in Table 4.2 in comparison with others' results. Umezawa _et al_. [8] and Worthington, Gallagher, and Dinger [9] measured the penetration depth and coherence length in both the c and a-b directions. From their results, one concluded an anisotropic factor \gamma of 3-5; however, their measured penetration depths \lambda's at 0 K were smaller than the \lambda's measured by others [31]^{- 35} and us. Harshman _et al_. [31] measured the penetration depth along both directions, but no coherence length data were obtained. \lambda_{\parallel} and \xi_{\parallel} reported in Refs. [32]^{- 34} were consistent; they measured \lambda_{\parallel} = 1400 A and \xi_{\parallel} = 20 \sim 22 A. However, no data along the c-axis direction were available for comparison.

We do not believe that the above values of \xi's we obtained represent their intrinsic limit. This is because we measured \lambda_{\parallel} \simeq 1800 A at 4 K; however, many groups [31]^{- 33} have reported \lambda_{\parallel}(0) to be about 1400 A. If we assume the latter value of \lambda_{\parallel} to be intrinsic, we extrapolate the following values for \xi_{\parallel} and \xi_{\perp}, respectively, at 0 K: 19 and 6 A.
