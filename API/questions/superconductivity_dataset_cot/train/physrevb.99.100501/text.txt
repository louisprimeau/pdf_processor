# Abstract

We have found that magnetically ordered noncentrosymmetric CeNiC\({}_{2}\) exhibits superconductivity under very high pressures of near 11 GPa. The transition temperature _T_c is 3.5 K, the _highest_ in all Ce heavy-fermion superconductors, implying quite strong electron pairings with a high-energy scale. Several physical quantities show diverging features of a quantum phase transition, however, its criticality appears in a rather narrow range of pressure. The upper critical field \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(T=0)\) is estimated to be 18 T, much higher than the Pauli paramagnetic limiting field of 6.5 T, indicating spin-triplet electron pairings correlated with its noncentrosymmetric structure.

## 1 Introduction

The discovery of magnetism in CeNiC\({}_{2}\) has been a major breakthrough in the understanding of magnetism in CeNiC\({}_{2}\). The discovery of magnetism in CeNiC\({}_{2}\) has been a major breakthrough in the understanding of magnetism in CeNiC\({}_{2}\).

  diffraction examined up to 16 GPa shows that this _Annm_2 NCS structure is kept under high pressure. The unit-cell volume is decreased linearly by 7.6(4)% for 16 GPa, i.e., the compressibility is \(0.47(3)\times 10^{-11}\ \text{m}^{2}/\text{N}\)[10].

The data under high pressures up to 15 GPa were collected with a cubic-anvil-type high-pressure apparatus between 2 K and room temperature. A teflon capsule (with a diameter of 1.5 mm at ambient pressure) with a transmitting medium of glycerol retains pressure hydrostatically. This teflon capsule was placed in a cubic-type integrated-fin gasket (\(5\times 5\times 5\ \text{mm}^{3}\)) made of MgO [11]. The electric resistivity was measured by the conventional four-probe method, and the susceptibility by the ac induction technique with a frequency of 317 Hz. The resistivity in the magnetic fields was measured using a superconducting magnet up to 5 T. The pressure was determined by the superconducting transition of Pb.

The temperature dependences of the electrical resistivity \(\rho\) are shown in Fig. 1(a) for the data from 0 to 8 GPa, and Fig. 1(b) for those from 9 to 14 GPa. At ambient pressure \(\rho\) decreases with decreasing temperature and exhibits a steep fall below 20 K, where \(d\rho/dT\) shows an apparent anomaly; they indicate the transition temperature to AFIC, \(T_{\text{AFIC}}\), shown with a black arrow in Fig. 1(a). With increasing pressure \(T_{\text{AFIC}}\) substantially increases from 20 K at a rate of 2.4 K/GPa, reaching a maximum at about 35 K under 6 and 7 GPa.

For AFC and F, anomalies are _not_ obvious in \(\rho\) itself and also in \(d\rho/dT\); thus those transitions were determined with specific heat before [5]. Here, we decide them by dc magnetization using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer; however, because of a limit of the pressure apparatus used (a piston-cylinder-type cell made of Cu-Be alloys), those temperatures have been determined only up to 2 GPa. The results indicate that the transitions to AFC and F do not change largely. The determination of their transition temperatures is important, but precise specific heat measurements under the 10-GPa class were difficult.

Above around 6 GPa the resistivity above 60 K shows sign of a decrease, indicating Kondo behavior as \(-\ln T\). The resistivity at the higher temperatures increases with the phonon resistivity; see the inset of Fig. 1(a). At 8 GPa, the raw resistivity shows no clear anomaly with \(T_{\text{AFIC}}\), implying that the MO starts to break down. There, an anomaly in \(d\rho/dT\) is apparent, which determines the AFIC transition. This transition rapidly decreases with pressure, as shown by the black arrows in Fig. 1(b).

At about 10 GPa, with a collapse of MO, the resistivity falls suddenly below about 3 K (an emergence of SC). Figure 2 shows the data around 11 GPa below 8 K. The SC was observed under pressures of 10.7 and 11 GPa at 3.5 K. These transitions are fairly sharp with a width of less than 0.4 K. Taking into account that the sample examined is a polycrystal consisting of many grains and there may exist a nonuniformity of pressure surrounding the sample, the _intrinsic_ transition is expected to be sharp as well; thus, \(T_{\text{c}}\) can be considered to be 3.5 K. The ac magnetic susceptibility under these pressures is indicated in the inset of Fig. 2, showing the diamagnetism associated with SC. Since the magnitude of the signal around 11 GPa is as large as that from Pb, the pressure gauge, the SC is of a bulk origin. The \(T_{\text{c}}\) observed is quite high compared

The black arrows indicate the transition temperatures \(T_{\text{AFIC}}\). SC is observed at 3.5 K under pressures around 11 GPa, shown with the (red) arrow. The insets display the resistivity up to 300 K.

  with that of other NCS Ce-based superconductors whose \(T_{\rm c}\)'s are of the order of 1 K [3,12, 13, 14], and furthermore, with that of all Ce heavy-fermion superconductors whose highest \(T_{\rm c}\) is 2.6 K of CeCoIn\({}_{5}\)[15].

Under 10.7 and 11 GPa only, the resistivity above \(T_{\rm c}\) increases in proportion to \(T\) up to about 80 K, as shown in Fig. 1(b) and its inset. This shows a non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior. Such a linear-\(T\) dependence was predicted for two-dimensional (2D) AF SF [16]. These results imply that the SC found is not a conventional BCS type mediated with phonons but is an unconventional one with some magnetic origin. The high \(T_{\rm c}\) observed may be correlated _first_ with strong SF, accompanied by the collapse of MO with high transition temperatures.

Above 12 GPa the SC disappears and the low-temperature resistivity follows \(AT^{2}\); see the resistivity in Fig. 1(b) which displays an upward curvature. This shows a change to a Fermi-liquid (FL) character. The coefficient \(A\) represents the strength of the interaction between conduction electrons. \(A\) and the residual resistivity \(\rho_{0}\) obtained from the data exhibit a peak at around 11 GPa and decrease rapidly under higher pressures. These results indicate a QC behavior, and changes from an enhanced strongly correlated metal to a normal one.

These results are summarized in the _P-T_ phase diagram of Fig. 3. As described above, the phase diagram shows the enhancement and collapse of MO, the emergence of SC and NFL, and then the change to FL, with pressure. The regions for NFL and FL were determined from the temperatures where the resistivity depends on \(T\) and \(T^{2}\), respectively. The phase diagram acquired is similar to that of heavy-fermion superconductors with MO. However, in this system, all the states, i.e., MO, SC, NFL, and FL, are fairly sensitive to pressure at around the critical pressure of 11 GPa; the QC behavior emerges quite sharply. The quantity \(\sqrt{A}\) in the figure, which is proportional to the enhanced effective electron mass \(m^{*}\), decreases substantially with pressure. The magnetism and bulk SC seem to coexist only in the critical region. At higher temperatures over 100 K the resistivity shows the Kondo effect (KE); see the inset of Fig. 1(b).

The present results are compared with the pressure effects on the paramagnetic superconductor LaNiC\({}_{2}\)[17]. Those results indicated that its SC could be related to a QC feature with strong electronic correlations, most likely a charge density wave (CDW). The emergence of SC in magnetic CeNiC\({}_{2}\) can be connected with magnetic fluctuations originated from its MO.

As shown before, SC appears at a rather high temperature of 3.5 K. According to the SF theory, the \(T_{\rm c}\) of high-\(T_{\rm c}\) cuprates and heavy-fermion superconductors can be correlated with the frequency spread of their antiferromagnetic fluctuations \(T_{0}\). Here, \(T_{0}\) is given with the coefficient of the electronic specific heat \(\gamma\) as \(\approx\)12 500/\(\gamma\)[18]. For CeNiC\({}_{2}\) we now have no information about \(\gamma\) under the critical pressure; however, with a relation \(\gamma\approx R\ln 2/T_{\rm K}\) for the doublet ground state (\(R\) is the molar gas constant and \(T_{\rm K}\) is the Kondo temperature), \(\gamma\) is roughly evaluated to be 600 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) because its \(T_{\rm K}\) is reported as \(\sim\)10 K [19]. This \(\gamma\) seems to be relevant since \(\gamma\) at ambient pressure is about 300 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\)[5] and in the SF model \(\gamma\) will be enhanced at the critical region. Supposing \(\gamma\sim 600\) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\), we have \(T_{\rm c}\sim 0.7\) K from the figure of Ref. [18]. If these estimations are appropriate, \(T_{\rm c}\) observed at 3.5 K is much higher than that estimated with \(\gamma\) in the SF model. Thus, to explain such a strong enhancement of \(T_{\rm c}\) in the experiment, other factors would be necessary. Some _exotic_ mechanism with a higher-energy scale, such as a valence-fluctuation (VF) model [20], is a candidate to explain the high \(T_{\rm c}\).

To other NCS Ce-based superconductors, \(T_{\rm c}\)'s were reported as \(\sim\)1 K and \(\gamma\) as \(\sim\)100 mJ/molK\({}^{2}\)[3, 12, 13, 14]. The relationship between \(T_{\rm c}\) and \(T_{0}\) indicated above gives \(T_{\rm c}\) of \(\sim\)5 K [18]; the systematically and fairly low \(T_{\rm c}\)'s observed in the experiments might be due to the spin-triplet nature of their SC or some other features not included in SF

The magnetic field effects on the resistivity are indicated in Fig. 4. The maximum field was 5 T. The pressure applied

That for LaNiC\({}_{2}\), at ambient pressure, is about 0.3 T, the data are multiplied by a factor of 5. The dotted lines show the fits to the WHH theory.

  was 11.4 GPa. Only a clamp-type pressure cell could be used for this experiment; therefore the tuning of pressure at around 11 GPa was difficult. SC under this pressure shows a transition with a width of about 1 K, as observed previously. The results show that this SC is quite robust in magnetic fields. The slope of \(\mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}}\) near \(H=0\), \(d(\mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}})/dT\equiv\mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}}^{\prime}\sim-7.1\) T/K for the onset resistivity, whose \(T_{\text{c}}(H=0)\) of 3.5 K is the same as that under the critical pressure of 11 GPa. The slope of \(\mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}}\) for the zero resistivity, \(T_{\text{c}}\sim 2.5\) K, is similar to that for the onset data. From the empirical parabolic relation, \(H_{\text{c2}}(T)/H_{\text{c2}}(0)=1-t^{2}\) (\(t=T/T_{\text{c}}\)), \(\mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}}\) at \(T=0\) is roughly estimated to be 20 T. This field is much higher than the Pauli paramagnetic limiting field \(\mu_{0}H_{\text{P}}^{\text{RCS}}\) of 6.5 T evaluated from \(\Delta/(\sqrt{2}\mu_{\text{B}})\approx 1.86T_{\text{c}}\); here, \(\Delta\) is the superconducting energy gap. This high \(\mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}}\) indicates that SC of the system is likely a spin triplet. Such an unusual triplet state has been established in subsequent studies for all other NCS Ce-based SC with quite high \(\mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}}\)'s. The spin triplet proposed here also corresponds with its NCS structure of the system. This spin-triplet state, however, as well as the coexistence with the spin-singlet state, should be examined further.

From the formula \(\mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}}=\Phi/(2\pi\xi^{2})\), where \(\Phi\) is the flux quantum, the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence length \(\xi\) is obtained to be \(4.2\times 10^{-9}\) m experimentally. This \(\xi\) is comparable with the Pippard coherence length \(\xi_{0}\) (\(\sim\)the size of the interacting pairs, given by the conventional BCS theory as \(\xi_{0}=0.18\hbar v_{\text{F}}/k_{\text{B}}T_{\text{c}}\) with the Fermi velocity \(v_{\text{F}}\)), i.e., \(\xi\sim\xi_{0}\) at \(T=0\)[21]. Physically, when the distance between vortices becomes equal to that between interacting electrons, SC would collapse. When we assume a spherical Fermi surface with \(\gamma\sim 600\) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) in the SF model before, \(\xi_{0}\) is evaluated to be \(\sim\)0.7 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-9}\) m, which is rather shorter than the GL coherence length \(\xi\) obtained above; such a discrepancy suggests again that the present SC is not explained well with the SF model. Supposing that \(\gamma\sim 100\) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\), which is considerably smaller than that assumed in SF, \(\xi_{0}\) will be righty \(\sim\)4 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-9}\) m of \(\xi\) above. The decrease in \(\gamma\) near the critical pressure such as this, caused by the valence changes there, is a characteristic of the VF model referred to previously. Moreover, the results observed, i.e., the higher \(T_{\text{c}}\), the fairly sharp QC compared with those in SF, and the enhanced \(T\)-linear dependence of \(\rho\) (which should be dimension-independent), are also reasonably explained by VF [20]. Noted that the relationship between \(T_{\text{c}}\) and \(T_{0}\) based on SF shown before would not be simply applicable to VF.

The \(v_{\text{F}}\) estimated from \(\xi\) above, with the residual resistivity \(\rho_{0}\sim 20\)\(\mu\Omega\) cm, gives the mean free path \(l\) (\(=v_{\text{F}}\tau\); here, \(\tau\) is a relaxation time \(\propto m^{\ast}/\rho_{0}\)) \(\sim\)1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-8}\) m. This value is larger than \(\xi\), indicating that the system is in the clean limit. In this case the orbital limiting field is calculated from \(\mu_{0}H_{\text{nch}}^{\text{BS}}=0.727(-\mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}}^{\prime})T_{\text{c}}\)[22]. Using the slope of \(\mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}}\) before, \(\mu_{0}H_{\text{nch}}^{\text{BS}}\) at \(T=0\) is obtained to be 18 T, consistent with that estimated roughly before. The lines in Fig. 4 show fits to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory. Note that the sample used is a polycrystal; when the SC has strong anisotropy, \(\mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}}\) of the system could be higher than 18 T.

As displayed in Fig. 4, \(\mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}}\) for LaNiC\({}_{2}\) observed in our resistivity and magnetization measurements is as small as about 0.3 T, which is very low compared with the calculated \(\mu_{0}H_{\text{P}}^{\text{RCS}}\) of 5.5 T for \(T_{\text{c}}\sim 3\) K. On this SC, the nonunitary triplet state was proposed from a muon spin relaxation (\(\mu\)SR) experiment and group theoretical discussions [23,24]. The very low \(\mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}}\) of LaNiC\({}_{2}\), however, with other results referred to in Ref. [8], may suggest that its SC could be a spin singlet. The "nonunitarity" might be expected for the spin-triplet state implied for this CeNiC\({}_{2}\), since the discussion on LaNiC\({}_{2}\) with the point group \(C_{2\nu}\) mentioned above would be equally applied to this system. Noted that CeNiC\({}_{2}\) has the F phase exhibiting a spontaneous magnetization [9].

With the coherence length \(\xi_{0}\) and \(\gamma\sim 100\) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\), the number \(k_{\text{F}}\xi_{0}\) is calculated to be \(\sim\)40 (\(k_{\text{F}}\) is the Fermi momentum given by \(m^{\ast}v_{\text{F}}/\hbar\), and \(1/k_{\text{F}}\) is the average distance between electrons). This number is rather small. The ratio \(\Delta/E_{\text{F}}\) (\(E_{\text{F}}\) is the Fermi energy) is \(\sim\)0.02, and is fairly large. Compare them with those estimated for CePt\({}_{3}\)Si: \(k_{\text{F}}\xi_{0}\sim 90\) and \(\Delta/E_{\text{F}}\sim 0.005\). The characteristic values indicated above further imply that this SC is exotic, reflecting the short coherence length \(\xi_{0}\) and the high \(T_{\text{c}}\), thus the strong electron couplings.

To conclude, high-pressure experiments on magnetic NCS CeNiC\({}_{2}\) have shown a unique SC. Its \(T_{\text{c}}\) is quite high, 3.5 K under 11 GPa. The QC behavior observed is rather sharp against pressure. The specific features observed could be understood by a model such as VF with a high-energy process. The \(\mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}}\) evaluated for \(T=0\) is as high as 18 T, indicating that this SC has a spin-triplet nature in connection with its peculiar \(Anm2\) NCS.
