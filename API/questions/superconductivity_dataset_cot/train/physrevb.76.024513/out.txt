###### Abstract

Transport properties are systematically studied for single crystals of Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} (0.015 \leq x \leq 0.110). Both the in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity show a wide peak due to charge density waves (CDWs) for single crystals with x \approx 0.025. After the CDW state is completely suppressed around x = 0.055, the superconductivity is apparently enhanced by Cu doping. No superconducting transition is observed above 1.8 K for Cu_{0.11}TiSe_{2}. The anisotropy in the resistivity increases with increasing Cu content, and is nearly T independent. The CDW state has a strong effect on the Hall coefficient and thermopower. Large thermopower, comparable to that of the triangular lattice Na_{x}CoO_{2}, is observed in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}. Intercalation of Cu induces a negative magnetoresistance due to the interaction between conducting carriers and localized magnetic moments.

## I Introduction

Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD's) _MX_{2}_ (_M_ =transition metal, X = S, Se, or Te) have been extensively studied due to their two-dimensional structure and physical properties, such as superconductivity and a charge density wave (CDW) transition.[1; 2; 3] The structure of these compounds usually manifests two phases, 1T and 2H phase; structures are formed by _X_-_M_-_X_ sandwiches. The top and bottom sheets are chalcogen atoms, and the middle sheets are metal atoms. In the 1T phase, all the sandwiches stack on each other octahedrally, while in the 2H phase, the sandwiches stack in a trigonal prismate way. The CDW state is one of the most interesting phenomena observed in TMD's and widely studied. Superconductivity also appears in some materials, such as 2_H_-NbS_{2} which is a multigap _s_-wave superconductor. The coexistence of superconductivity and CDW state has been widely observed in 2H transition metal dichalcogenides TaSe_{2}, TaS_{2}, and NbSe_{2}. 2_H_-TaSe_{2} experiences incommensurate and a commensurate CDW transitions at 122 and 90 K, respectively; 2_H_-TaS_{2} and 2_H_-NbSe_{2} undergo only one incommensurate CDW transition at 75 and 35 K, respectively; while 2_H_-NbS_{2} shows no CDW transition.[1; 3; 4] In contrast to the CDW transition, the superconducting transition temperature decreases from 2_H_-TaSe_{2}, through 2_H_-TaS_{2} and 2_H_-NbSe_{2}, to 2_H_-NbS_{2}, indicating that the CDW state and superconductivity compete with each other.

The interaction between the layers of TMD's is of weak van der Waals type, so that this kind of compound can be easily intercalated by various guest species (e.g., alkali-metal atoms, 3d transition metal atoms, or molecules).[5; 6; 7] The lattice parameters are usually changed by intercalation; a superstructure can be observed at some guest concentrations.[3; 8] Such a superstructure is related to the CDW state. Recently, it has been found that intercalation of Na into 2_H_-TaS_{2} increases the superconducting transition temperature to 5 K, and suppresses the CDW transition.[9; 10; 11] The effect of pressure on superconductivity and the CDW state shows results in 2_H_-NbSe_{2}.[12] These results further indicate that the superconductivity and CDW state compete with each other.[3; 13]

The intercalation of various guest atoms into van der Waals gaps of _MX_{2}_ is another way to study TMD's and to find new phenomena. Recently, Cu has been successfully intercalated into 1_T_-TiSe_{2}.[14] Intercalation of Cu continuously suppresses the CDW transition; superconductivity emerges in the sample Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} with x \sim 0.04, and reaches a maximum transition temperature (_Tc_) of 4.15 K at x = 0.08; then _Tc_ decreases with further doping Cu.[14] The phase diagram of Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} is quite similar to that of high-_Tc_ cuprates. Therefore, it is of great interest to see if unconventional superconductivity exists in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} system. Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} is the first superconducting 1T structured _MX_{2}_ compound. TiSe_{2} intercalated with other 3d transition metals (e.g., V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) has been reported, but no superconductivity is observed.[8; 15] Study of the anisotropic properties of Cu_{0.07}TiSe_{2} shows that it is a normal type-II superconductor.[16] The results of thermal conductivity for Cu_{0.06}TiSe_{2} indicate that it is a single-gap _s_-wave superconductor.[17] Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy results show that intercalation of Cu could enhance the density of states, leading to superconductivity, but excessive Cu makes the superconductivity disappear due to strong inelastic scattering.[18] In order to understand the CDW state and superconductivity in the Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} system, we made a detailed study of the transport properties on high-quality single crystals of Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}. It is found that the CDW state has an observable effect on resistivity, Hall coefficient, and thermopower. Anisotropy in resistivity increases with increasing Cu content, and is nearly T independent, indicating the same scattering mechanism in the _ab_ plane and along the c axis in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}.

## II Experimental details

High-quality Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} single crystals were grown by the chemical iodine-vapor transport method. Powders of Cu (99.7%), Ti (99.5%), and Se (99.5%) were mixed and thoroughly ground, then pressed into a pellet. The pellet was sealed under vacuum in a quartz tube with diameter of 13 mm and length of 150 mm with iodine (10 mg/cm^{-3}). One end of the tube was slowly heated to 940 ^{\circ}C with heat  ing rate of \sim150 ^{\circ}C/h; the other end at 740 ^{\circ}C. After one week, the furnace was cooled to room temperature over a few hours. Finally, many golden platelike Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} crystals were obtained. The typical dimension is about 5 \times 5 \times 0.03 mm^{3}. Because the element Cu can react with Se very easily, excess Cu was used as starting material. For example, in order to grow Cu_{0.055}TiSe_{2} crystals, the molar stoichiometry of the Cu, Ti, and Se powder is 0.4:1:2. The actual composition of the single crystals was determined by x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF-1800, Shimadzu Inc.)

All crystals were characterized with a Rigaku D/max-A x-ray diffractometer with graphite-monochromatized Cu K\alpha1 radiation (\lambda = 1.5406 A) in the 2 \theta range of 10^{\circ}-70^{\circ} with steps of 0.02^{\circ} at room temperature. Resistivity measurements were performed on an ac resistance bridge (Linear Research, Inc., Model LR700) by the standard four-probe method. The magnetic field was supplied by a superconducting magnet system (Oxford Instruments). The Hall contact configuration is the standard ac six-probe geometry. To eliminate the offset voltage due to the asymmetric Hall terminals, the magnetic field was scanned from -5 to 5 T. Thermopower measurements were carried out with a home-built apparatus and performed using small and reversible temperature differences of 0.5 K. Two ends of the single crystals were attached to two separated copper heat sinks to generate the temperature gradient along the crystal _ab_ plane. Two Rh-Fe thermometers were glued to the heat sink (next to the single crystals). Copper leads were adhered to the single crystals and all the data were corrected for the contribution of the Cu leads.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figure 1 shows the c-axis lattice parameter as a function of Cu content (x). The c-axis lattice parameter was obtained by x-ray diffraction on single crystals of Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} with different x. It shows a good relationship between the c-axis lattice parameter and Cu content. The c-axis lattice parameter increases linearly with increasing Cu content. This is consistent with the results reported in polycrystalline samples.[14]

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the in-plane resistivity \rho_{ab} from 300 to 2 K for Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} crystals with different Cu content (x=0.015, 0.025, 0.055, 0.065, 0.08, 0.10, and 0.11). As show in Fig. 2, \rho_{ab} shows a wide peak due to the CDW for samples with x \equiv 0.025; the CDW peak becomes broader and moves to lower temperature with increasing x. This indicates that the intercalation of Cu suppresses the CDW, the observations consistent with that of Morosan _et al.[14]_ For the sample with x=0.055, the CDW peak disappears and the resistivity becomes nearly T^{2} dependent. This suggests that the CDW state is completely suppressed around x=0.055. The fact that intercalation of Cu leads to suppression of the CDW state could be related to the structural change induced by Cu doping. In TiSe_{2}, the TiSe_{2} goes through a 2 \times 2 \times 2 structural transition below 200 K, leading to a CDW state.[19, 20] The CDW state has a close relationship with the structure of TiSe_{2}. When Cu is intercalated into the TiSe_{2} layers, such a 2 \times 2 \times 2 lattice is destroyed. The disorder of the Cu atoms destroys the superlattice of TiSe_{2}, leading to suppression of the CDW state.

The resistivity monotonically decreases with increasing Cu content. The residual resistivity ratio \rho_{ab}(300 K)/\rho_{ab}(5 K) increases from \sim2 to \sim5 with increasing Cu content from 0.015 to 0.11. These results are consistent with those reported in polycrystalline samples.[14] In order to clearly show the superconducting transition, the low-temperature \rho_{ab}(T) data were plotted in the inset of Fig. 2. The superconducting transition temperature (T_{onset}) is 2.24, 3.40, 4.13, and 3.02 K for the samples with x=0.055, 0.065, 0.08, and 0.10, respectively. It should be pointed out that the superconducting transition is not observed in the sample with x=0.11 while cooling the sample to 1.8 K. These results are nearly consistent with the phase diagram obtained from polycrystalline samples.[14]

The temperature dependence of the out-of-plane resistivity \rho_{c} is plotted in Fig. 3(a) for samples of Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} crystals

  with different Cu content (_x_ = 0.015, 0.025, 0.055, 0.065, and 0.110). As shown in Fig. 3(a), \rho_{c}(T) shows similar behavior to \rho_{ab}(T). \rho_{c}(T) monotonically decreases with increasing Cu content. An obvious CDW peak can be observed in \rho_{c}(T) for slightly Cu-doped samples with x \leq 0.025. The CDW state is suppressed by intercalation of more Cu. \rho_{c}(T) shows T^{2}-dependent behavior for the samples without a CDW state. The temperature dependence of the resistivity anisotropy \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab} is shown in Fig. 3(b) for samples of Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} crystals with different Cu content (_x_ = 0.015, 0.025, 0.055, 0.065, and 0.110). \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab} shows a weak temperature dependence in all the samples with different Cu content. This indicates that the charge transport mechanism is the same in the _ab_ plane and along Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}. Compared to the case of TiS_{2}, the anisotropy for the samples Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} is smaller. In the case of TiS_{2} the resistivity anisotropy is 1500 and 750 at 5 and 300 K, respectively.[21] In Cu,TiSe_{2}, Se has a larger radius and stronger covalence than S, so that the carriers can move more easily between the layers in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} than in TiS_{2}. With intercalation of Cu, the in-plane conductivity is strongly enhanced over the _c_-axis conductivity, so that the anisotropy increases with increasing x in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}. A similar enhancement of anisotropy with increasing carrier content is observed in _n_-type cuprates.[22]

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the in-plane thermopower (_S_) for the Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} crystals with x = 0.015, 0.065, and 0.110. The thermopower is negative in the whole temperature range. This indicates that the carrier is n type. At room temperature, the magnitude of S decreases with increasing x. The thermopower shows a nonmonotonic temperature dependence for the sample Cu_{0.015}TiSe_{2}; a maximum value of S appears at 150 K at which a CDW transition is observed in resistivity. This suggests that the nonmonotonic T dependence for S arises from the occurrence of CDW order. For the samples without a CDW state, the magnitude of S monotonically decreases with decreasing temperature. All these results indicate that the metallic nature of Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} is enhanced by electron doping. It should be pointed out that the thermopower is anomalously large. Compared to the triangular lattice Na_{x}CoO_{2} with large thermopower, Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} shows a larger _S_^{2}/\rho_{ab} at room temperature than Na_{x}CoO_{2}. In Cu_{0.065}TiSe_{2}, _S_(300 K) \approx 60 \muV/K and \rho_{ab}(300 K) \approx 0.15 m\Omega cm; while for Na_{0.68}CoO_{2}, _S_(300 K) \approx 90 \muV/K and \rho_{ab}(300 K) \approx 1 m\Omega cm.[23] In this sense, Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} has a larger power factor than Na_{x}CoO_{2}. In the Na_{x}CoO_{2} system, the anomalously large thermopower is ascribed to the contribution of spin entropy.[24] Therefore, the anomalously large thermopower in the Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} system deserves further investigation.

Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient (R_{H}) for Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} with x = 0.015, 0.025, 0.065, 0.110. In the whole temperature range, R_{H} is negative. Both the thermopower and the Hall coefficient indicate that the carrier is n type in the Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} system. The Hall coefficient decreases with increasing Cu content. This indicates that the carrier concentration increases with Cu doping, consistent with the results of resistivity and thermopower. The samples with a CDW state show a strongly temperature-dependent R_{H} behavior. The Hall coefficient shows a strong T dependence below 200 K for the sample with x = 0.015, and below 100 K for the sample with x = 0.025. These results coincide with the

  occurrence of CDW order observed in resistivity. For the samples without a CDW state, the Hall coefficient shows _T_-independent behavior within the uncertainty. This indicates characteristics of a metal for the heavily Cu-doped sample. It further indicates that the _T_-dependent Hall coefficient arises from the CDW state. Formation of the CDW state leads to localization of some carriers, so that the number of conducting carriers decreases, and consequently enhances the Hall coefficient. This is why the _RH_ increases below 200 and 100 K for the samples with x =0.015 and 0.025 as shown in Fig. 5.

Figure 6 shows the _H_^{2} dependence of isothermal in-plane magnetoresistance (MR) with magnetic field along the c axis for Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} with x = 0.015, 0.055, 0.065, and 0.110 at 6, 15, and 30 K. For the sample with x = 0.015, the isothermal MR is positive in the whole magnetic field range, and shows a good _H_^{2}-dependent behavior at different temperatures. It implies that the isothermal MR just comes from the contribution of the Lorentz force to the carriers under a magnetic field. However, the isothermal MR shows a complicated magnetic field (_H_) dependence for the samples with x = 0.065 and 0.110. The MR is negative and increases with increasing H at low magnetic field; then decreases and crosses zero at a certain H; the positive MR increases with increasing H at high magnetic field. This indicates that the MR comes from two contributions: one negative and one positive component. As shown in Fig. 6, the isothermal MR shows almost _H_^{2} dependence at high H for the samples with x = 0.065 and 0.110. It suggests that the MR is dominated by the Lorentz force. In order to understand the complicated MR, the formula \Delta\rho/\rho = -A_{1}^{2}\ln(1+A_{2}^{2}H^{2})+B_{1}^{2}H^{n} is used to fit the experimental data. The first term in the formula comes from a semiempirical expression proposed by Khosla and Fischer[25] and has been used to explain the negative MR. The basis for this formula is Toyazawa's localized-magnetic-moment model of magnetoresistance, where carriers in an impurity band are scattered by the localized spin of impurity atoms.[26] It is found that all data can be well fitted by the formula for all samples. This indicates that the negative MR comes from the interaction between conducting carriers and localized magnetic moments. It reveals a decrease of spin-dependent scattering of carriers in magnetic fields. When Cu is intercalated into the TiSe_{2} layers, some of the nonmagnetic Ti(IV) ions change into magnetic Ti(III), so that interaction between conducting carries and localized magnetic moments takes place. This interaction between conducting carriers and localized magnetic moments results in a negative contribution to the MR. Therefore, the complicated _H_-dependent MR can be well understood. However, an anomalous MR is observed for the sample with x = 0.055 compared to the observation of MR in other samples. The sample with x = 0.055 shows negative MR in the whole H range, and the negative MR monotonically increases with increasing H. This indicates that the MR is dominated by the interaction between conducting carries and localized magnetic moments even at high magnetic field. This anomaly could be related to the critical point for disappearance of the CDW state.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we have grown high-quality Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} single crystals with different Cu content from x = 0.015 to 0.110. The transport properties, anisotropic resistivity, thermoelectric power, Hall coefficient, and magnetoresistivity have been systematically studied. A systematic evolution of the CDW state and the superconducting state with Cu content is observed. It is found that the CDW state can be suppressed by intercalation of Cu, while superconductivity is induced. The CDW state gives a strong effect on the transport properties, leading to _T_-dependent Hall coefficient. An anomalously large thermopower is observed, even comparable to that of the large-thermopower material Na_{x}CoO_{2}. It deserves further study. Intercalation of Cu induces a negative MR due to the interaction between conducting carriers and localized magnetic moments.

###### Abstract

Transport properties are systematically studied for single crystals of Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} (0.015 \leq x \leq 0.110). Both the in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity show a wide peak due to charge density waves (CDWs) for single crystals with x \approx 0.025. After the CDW state is completely suppressed around x = 0.055, the superconductivity is apparently enhanced by Cu doping. No superconducting transition is observed above 1.8 K for Cu_{0.11}TiSe_{2}. The anisotropy in the resistivity increases with increasing Cu content, and is nearly T independent. The CDW state has a strong effect on the Hall coefficient and thermopower. Large thermopower, comparable to that of the triangular lattice Na_{x}CoO_{2}, is observed in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}. Intercalation of Cu induces a negative magnetoresistance due to the interaction between conducting carriers and localized magnetic moments.

## I Introduction

Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD's) _MX_{2}_ (_M_ =transition metal, X = S, Se, or Te) have been extensively studied due to their two-dimensional structure and physical properties, such as superconductivity and a charge density wave (CDW) transition.[1; 2; 3] The structure of these compounds usually manifests two phases, 1T and 2H phase; structures are formed by _X_-_M_-_X_ sandwiches. The top and bottom sheets are chalcogen atoms, and the middle sheets are metal atoms. In the 1T phase, all the sandwiches stack on each other octahedrally, while in the 2H phase, the sandwiches stack in a trigonal prismate way. The CDW state is one of the most interesting phenomena observed in TMD's and widely studied. Superconductivity also appears in some materials, such as 2_H_-NbS_{2} which is a multigap _s_-wave superconductor. The coexistence of superconductivity and CDW state has been widely observed in 2H transition metal dichalcogenides TaSe_{2}, TaS_{2}, and NbSe_{2}. 2_H_-TaSe_{2} experiences incommensurate and a commensurate CDW transitions at 122 and 90 K, respectively; 2_H_-TaS_{2} and 2_H_-NbSe_{2} undergo only one incommensurate CDW transition at 75 and 35 K, respectively; while 2_H_-NbS_{2} shows no CDW transition.[1; 3; 4] In contrast to the CDW transition, the superconducting transition temperature decreases from 2_H_-TaSe_{2}, through 2_H_-TaS_{2} and 2_H_-NbSe_{2}, to 2_H_-NbS_{2}, indicating that the CDW state and superconductivity compete with each other.

The interaction between the layers of TMD's is of weak van der Waals type, so that this kind of compound can be easily intercalated by various guest species (e.g., alkali-metal atoms, 3d transition metal atoms, or molecules).[5; 6; 7] The lattice parameters are usually changed by intercalation; a superstructure can be observed at some guest concentrations.[3; 8] Such a superstructure is related to the CDW state. Recently, it has been found that intercalation of Na into 2_H_-TaS_{2} increases the superconducting transition temperature to 5 K, and suppresses the CDW transition.[9; 10; 11] The effect of pressure on superconductivity and the CDW state shows results in 2_H_-NbSe_{2}.[12] These results further indicate that the superconductivity and CDW state compete with each other.[3; 13]

The intercalation of various guest atoms into van der Waals gaps of _MX_{2}_ is another way to study TMD's and to find new phenomena. Recently, Cu has been successfully intercalated into 1_T_-TiSe_{2}.[14] Intercalation of Cu continuously suppresses the CDW transition; superconductivity emerges in the sample Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} with x \sim 0.04, and reaches a maximum transition temperature (_Tc_) of 4.15 K at x = 0.08; then _Tc_ decreases with further doping Cu.[14] The phase diagram of Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} is quite similar to that of high-_Tc_ cuprates. Therefore, it is of great interest to see if unconventional superconductivity exists in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} system. Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} is the first superconducting 1T structured _MX_{2}_ compound. TiSe_{2} intercalated with other 3d transition metals (e.g., V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) has been reported, but no superconductivity is observed.[8; 15] Study of the anisotropic properties of Cu_{0.07}TiSe_{2} shows that it is a normal type-II superconductor.[16] The results of thermal conductivity for Cu_{0.06}TiSe_{2} indicate that it is a single-gap _s_-wave superconductor.[17] Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy results show that intercalation of Cu could enhance the density of states, leading to superconductivity, but excessive Cu makes the superconductivity disappear due to strong inelastic scattering.[18] In order to understand the CDW state and superconductivity in the Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} system, we made a detailed study of the transport properties on high-quality single crystals of Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}. It is found that the CDW state has an observable effect on resistivity, Hall coefficient, and thermopower. Anisotropy in resistivity increases with increasing Cu content, and is nearly T independent, indicating the same scattering mechanism in the _ab_ plane and along the c axis in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}.

## II Experimental details

High-quality Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} single crystals were grown by the chemical iodine-vapor transport method. Powders of Cu (99.7%), Ti (99.5%), and Se (99.5%) were mixed and thoroughly ground, then pressed into a pellet. The pellet was sealed under vacuum in a quartz tube with diameter of 13 mm and length of 150 mm with iodine (10 mg/cm^{-3}). One end of the tube was slowly heated to 940 ^{\circ}C with heat  ing rate of \sim150 ^{\circ}C/h; the other end at 740 ^{\circ}C. After one week, the furnace was cooled to room temperature over a few hours. Finally, many golden platelike Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} crystals were obtained. The typical dimension is about 5 \times 5 \times 0.03 mm^{3}. Because the element Cu can react with Se very easily, excess Cu was used as starting material. For example, in order to grow Cu_{0.055}TiSe_{2} crystals, the molar stoichiometry of the Cu, Ti, and Se powder is 0.4:1:2. The actual composition of the single crystals was determined by x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF-1800, Shimadzu Inc.)

All crystals were characterized with a Rigaku D/max-A x-ray diffractometer with graphite-monochromatized Cu K\alpha1 radiation (\lambda = 1.5406 A) in the 2 \theta range of 10^{\circ}-70^{\circ} with steps of 0.02^{\circ} at room temperature. Resistivity measurements were performed on an ac resistance bridge (Linear Research, Inc., Model LR700) by the standard four-probe method. The magnetic field was supplied by a superconducting magnet system (Oxford Instruments). The Hall contact configuration is the standard ac six-probe geometry. To eliminate the offset voltage due to the asymmetric Hall terminals, the magnetic field was scanned from -5 to 5 T. Thermopower measurements were carried out with a home-built apparatus and performed using small and reversible temperature differences of 0.5 K. Two ends of the single crystals were attached to two separated copper heat sinks to generate the temperature gradient along the crystal _ab_ plane. Two Rh-Fe thermometers were glued to the heat sink (next to the single crystals). Copper leads were adhered to the single crystals and all the data were corrected for the contribution of the Cu leads.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figure 1 shows the c-axis lattice parameter as a function of Cu content (x). The c-axis lattice parameter was obtained by x-ray diffraction on single crystals of Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} with different x. It shows a good relationship between the c-axis lattice parameter and Cu content. The c-axis lattice parameter increases linearly with increasing Cu content. This is consistent with the results reported in polycrystalline samples.[14]

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the in-plane resistivity \rho_{ab} from 300 to 2 K for Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} crystals with different Cu content (x=0.015, 0.025, 0.055, 0.065, 0.08, 0.10, and 0.11). As show in Fig. 2, \rho_{ab} shows a wide peak due to the CDW for samples with x \equiv 0.025; the CDW peak becomes broader and moves to lower temperature with increasing x. This indicates that the intercalation of Cu suppresses the CDW, the observations consistent with that of Morosan _et al.[14]_ For the sample with x=0.055, the CDW peak disappears and the resistivity becomes nearly T^{2} dependent. This suggests that the CDW state is completely suppressed around x=0.055. The fact that intercalation of Cu leads to suppression of the CDW state could be related to the structural change induced by Cu doping. In TiSe_{2}, the TiSe_{2} goes through a 2 \times 2 \times 2 structural transition below 200 K, leading to a CDW state.[19, 20] The CDW state has a close relationship with the structure of TiSe_{2}. When Cu is intercalated into the TiSe_{2} layers, such a 2 \times 2 \times 2 lattice is destroyed. The disorder of the Cu atoms destroys the superlattice of TiSe_{2}, leading to suppression of the CDW state.

The resistivity monotonically decreases with increasing Cu content. The residual resistivity ratio \rho_{ab}(300 K)/\rho_{ab}(5 K) increases from \sim2 to \sim5 with increasing Cu content from 0.015 to 0.11. These results are consistent with those reported in polycrystalline samples.[14] In order to clearly show the superconducting transition, the low-temperature \rho_{ab}(T) data were plotted in the inset of Fig. 2. The superconducting transition temperature (T_{onset}) is 2.24, 3.40, 4.13, and 3.02 K for the samples with x=0.055, 0.065, 0.08, and 0.10, respectively. It should be pointed out that the superconducting transition is not observed in the sample with x=0.11 while cooling the sample to 1.8 K. These results are nearly consistent with the phase diagram obtained from polycrystalline samples.[14]

The temperature dependence of the out-of-plane resistivity \rho_{c} is plotted in Fig. 3(a) for samples of Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} crystals

  with different Cu content (_x_ = 0.015, 0.025, 0.055, 0.065, and 0.110). As shown in Fig. 3(a), \rho_{c}(T) shows similar behavior to \rho_{ab}(T). \rho_{c}(T) monotonically decreases with increasing Cu content. An obvious CDW peak can be observed in \rho_{c}(T) for slightly Cu-doped samples with x \leq 0.025. The CDW state is suppressed by intercalation of more Cu. \rho_{c}(T) shows T^{2}-dependent behavior for the samples without a CDW state. The temperature dependence of the resistivity anisotropy \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab} is shown in Fig. 3(b) for samples of Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} crystals with different Cu content (_x_ = 0.015, 0.025, 0.055, 0.065, and 0.110). \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab} shows a weak temperature dependence in all the samples with different Cu content. This indicates that the charge transport mechanism is the same in the _ab_ plane and along Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}. Compared to the case of TiS_{2}, the anisotropy for the samples Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} is smaller. In the case of TiS_{2} the resistivity anisotropy is 1500 and 750 at 5 and 300 K, respectively.[21] In Cu,TiSe_{2}, Se has a larger radius and stronger covalence than S, so that the carriers can move more easily between the layers in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} than in TiS_{2}. With intercalation of Cu, the in-plane conductivity is strongly enhanced over the _c_-axis conductivity, so that the anisotropy increases with increasing x in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}. A similar enhancement of anisotropy with increasing carrier content is observed in _n_-type cuprates.[22]

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the in-plane thermopower (_S_) for the Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} crystals with x = 0.015, 0.065, and 0.110. The thermopower is negative in the whole temperature range. This indicates that the carrier is n type. At room temperature, the magnitude of S decreases with increasing x. The thermopower shows a nonmonotonic temperature dependence for the sample Cu_{0.015}TiSe_{2}; a maximum value of S appears at 150 K at which a CDW transition is observed in resistivity. This suggests that the nonmonotonic T dependence for S arises from the occurrence of CDW order. For the samples without a CDW state, the magnitude of S monotonically decreases with decreasing temperature. All these results indicate that the metallic nature of Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} is enhanced by electron doping. It should be pointed out that the thermopower is anomalously large. Compared to the triangular lattice Na_{x}CoO_{2} with large thermopower, Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} shows a larger _S_^{2}/\rho_{ab} at room temperature than Na_{x}CoO_{2}. In Cu_{0.065}TiSe_{2}, _S_(300 K) \approx 60 \muV/K and \rho_{ab}(300 K) \approx 0.15 m\Omega cm; while for Na_{0.68}CoO_{2}, _S_(300 K) \approx 90 \muV/K and \rho_{ab}(300 K) \approx 1 m\Omega cm.[23] In this sense, Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} has a larger power factor than Na_{x}CoO_{2}. In the Na_{x}CoO_{2} system, the anomalously large thermopower is ascribed to the contribution of spin entropy.[24] Therefore, the anomalously large thermopower in the Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} system deserves further investigation.

Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient (R_{H}) for Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} with x = 0.015, 0.025, 0.065, 0.110. In the whole temperature range, R_{H} is negative. Both the thermopower and the Hall coefficient indicate that the carrier is n type in the Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} system. The Hall coefficient decreases with increasing Cu content. This indicates that the carrier concentration increases with Cu doping, consistent with the results of resistivity and thermopower. The samples with a CDW state show a strongly temperature-dependent R_{H} behavior. The Hall coefficient shows a strong T dependence below 200 K for the sample with x = 0.015, and below 100 K for the sample with x = 0.025. These results coincide with the

  occurrence of CDW order observed in resistivity. For the samples without a CDW state, the Hall coefficient shows _T_-independent behavior within the uncertainty. This indicates characteristics of a metal for the heavily Cu-doped sample. It further indicates that the _T_-dependent Hall coefficient arises from the CDW state. Formation of the CDW state leads to localization of some carriers, so that the number of conducting carriers decreases, and consequently enhances the Hall coefficient. This is why the _RH_ increases below 200 and 100 K for the samples with x =0.015 and 0.025 as shown in Fig. 5.

Figure 6 shows the _H_^{2} dependence of isothermal in-plane magnetoresistance (MR) with magnetic field along the c axis for Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} with x = 0.015, 0.055, 0.065, and 0.110 at 6, 15, and 30 K. For the sample with x = 0.015, the isothermal MR is positive in the whole magnetic field range, and shows a good _H_^{2}-dependent behavior at different temperatures. It implies that the isothermal MR just comes from the contribution of the Lorentz force to the carriers under a magnetic field. However, the isothermal MR shows a complicated magnetic field (_H_) dependence for the samples with x = 0.065 and 0.110. The MR is negative and increases with increasing H at low magnetic field; then decreases and crosses zero at a certain H; the positive MR increases with increasing H at high magnetic field. This indicates that the MR comes from two contributions: one negative and one positive component. As shown in Fig. 6, the isothermal MR shows almost _H_^{2} dependence at high H for the samples with x = 0.065 and 0.110. It suggests that the MR is dominated by the Lorentz force. In order to understand the complicated MR, the formula \Delta\rho/\rho = -A_{1}^{2}\ln(1+A_{2}^{2}H^{2})+B_{1}^{2}H^{n} is used to fit the experimental data. The first term in the formula comes from a semiempirical expression proposed by Khosla and Fischer[25] and has been used to explain the negative MR. The basis for this formula is Toyazawa's localized-magnetic-moment model of magnetoresistance, where carriers in an impurity band are scattered by the localized spin of impurity atoms.[26] It is found that all data can be well fitted by the formula for all samples. This indicates that the negative MR comes from the interaction between conducting carriers and localized magnetic moments. It reveals a decrease of spin-dependent scattering of carriers in magnetic fields. When Cu is intercalated into the TiSe_{2} layers, some of the nonmagnetic Ti(IV) ions change into magnetic Ti(III), so that interaction between conducting carries and localized magnetic moments takes place. This interaction between conducting carriers and localized magnetic moments results in a negative contribution to the MR. Therefore, the complicated _H_-dependent MR can be well understood. However, an anomalous MR is observed for the sample with x = 0.055 compared to the observation of MR in other samples. The sample with x = 0.055 shows negative MR in the whole H range, and the negative MR monotonically increases with increasing H. This indicates that the MR is dominated by the interaction between conducting carries and localized magnetic moments even at high magnetic field. This anomaly could be related to the critical point for disappearance of the CDW state.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we have grown high-quality Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} single crystals with different Cu content from x = 0.015 to 0.110. The transport properties, anisotropic resistivity, thermoelectric power, Hall coefficient, and magnetoresistivity have been systematically studied. A systematic evolution of the CDW state and the superconducting state with Cu content is observed. It is found that the CDW state can be suppressed by intercalation of Cu, while superconductivity is induced. The CDW state gives a strong effect on the transport properties, leading to _T_-dependent Hall coefficient. An anomalously large thermopower is observed, even comparable to that of the large-thermopower material Na_{x}CoO_{2}. It deserves further study. Intercalation of Cu induces a negative MR due to the interaction between conducting carriers and localized magnetic moments.
