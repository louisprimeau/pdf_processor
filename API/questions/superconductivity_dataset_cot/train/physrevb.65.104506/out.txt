###### Abstract

The magnetism and superconductivity of Sm1,85-_x_Gd_Ce0.15CuO4-_d_ and Gd2-_Y_Ce_y_CuO4-_d_ crystals were investigated. In the Sm1,85-_x_Gd_Ce0.15CuO4-_d_ system, superconductivity is suppressed by Gd substitution, and temperature-induced magnetic transitions appear at 3, 7, and 135 K above x = 1.2 Cu spins have an antiferromagnetic (AF) order along the [110] direction among these transitions, and a weak-ferromagnetic (WF) moment due to a canting of Cu spins appears along the [\overline{1}10] direction at T  3 K and 7 K  T  135 K. The AF order at 3 K  T  7 K changes into a canted spin configuration via field-induced spin reorientation and induces the WF moment. The Neel temperature _T_NC, (135 K at x = 1.2) and spin-reorientation temperature _T_SR (7 K at x = 1.2), which are due to the Cu sublattice and are observed at low field intensity, increase with increasing x. Sm spins have an antiferromagnetic order along the [001] direction at x = 0 below the Neel temperature _T_NR (~5 K), but _T_NR , which is observed for low x at high field intensity, decreases with increasing x and disappears at x  1. Gd spins have an antiferromagnetic order along the [\overline{1}10] direction for specimens with x > 1.4 near 3 K. The change in the geometry of rare-earth and Cu spins resulting from Gd substitution is considered to be the reason for the suppression of superconductivity.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in R2-_Y_Ce_y_CuO4-_d_ (_R_ = Pr, Nd, Sm, or Eu) systems aroused considerable attention since these were the only copper oxide systems showing electron-type superconductivity.1 The parent insulating compound R2CuO4 crystallizes in a tetragonal structure (_T_' phase) in which the copper ions are surrounded by a square planar arrangement of oxygen ions. The existence of an antiferromagnetic order in the Cu sublattice has been revealed for R2CuO4 (_R_ = Pr, Nd, Sm, or Gd) by neutron diffraction.2-12 The antiferromagnetic order of Cu spins in the CuO2 plane occurs at a temperature between 200 and 300 K. When R3+ is replaced with Ce4+, negative carriers are injected into the CuO2 plane to compensate the valence of rare-earth sites, and the antiferromagnetic order disappears in accordance with the carrier doping; in addition, superconductivity with a transition temperature as high as 24 K appears at a Ce content of y = 0.15. On the other hand, the existence of an antiferromagnetic order in the rare-earth sublattice was revealed for R2CuO4 (_R_ = Nd, Sm, or Gd); moreover, the coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism of rare-earth ions has been suggested.8,10,12-16 R_{2-y}Ce_{y}CuO_{4-\delta} systems seem interesting to study the correlation between superconductivity in the Cu sublattice and antiferromagnetism in the rare-earth sublattice.

In the _T_'-type oxides of R2-_Y_Ce_y_CuO4-_d_ (_R_ = Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, or Gd), superconductivity is not observed when R is Gd. Since the Gd ion has the maximum magnetic moment (~8_m__B_) among the rare-earth ions in _T_'-type oxides, the magnetism of the Gd ion seems to make a considerable contribution to the suppression of superconductivity through a magnetic interaction between rare-earth and copper ions. In order to clarify the reason for the absence of superconductivity in the Gd2-_Y_Ce_y_CuO4-_d_ system, the superconductivity and magnetism of the Sm1,85-_x_Gd_Ce0.15CuO4-_d_ system were studied, and a possible contribution of the magnetism of Gd ions to the suppression of superconductivity was suggested; moreover, the existence of peculiar successive magnetic transitions, which are observed for specimens with high Gd content and sensitive to the applied magnetic field, was reported.17,18 The absence of superconductivity was also studied in the Gd2-_Y_Ce_y_CuO4-_d_ system through magnetic measurement, and the role of an antiferromagnetic order in the Cu sublattice was suggested;19 however, the reason for the absence as well as the intrinsic magnetic properties of the system seems as yet unclear. Since the magnetic properties of these materials are very sensitive to the intensity of the applied magnetic field, intrinsic magnetic properties must be studied using a very low magnetic field. Although the Gd2-_Y_Ce_y_CuO4-_d_ system may be a key material for the study, it seems important to study the Sm1,85-_x_Gd_Ce0.15CuO4-_d_ system using single crystals under a wide range of applied magnetic fields for clarifying the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in _T_'-type oxides. In the present study, the superconducting and magnetic properties of Sm1,85-_x_Gd_Ce0.15CuO4-_d_ crystals were investigated and compared with those of Gd2-_Y_Ce_y_CuO4-_d_ crystals.

## II Experiment

Single crystals of Sm1,85-_x_Gd_Ce0.15CuO4-_d_ and Gd2-_Y_Ce_y_CuO4-_d_ were prepared by the self-flux method us ing excess CuO as a flux. High-purity (99.9%) oxide powders of R_{2}O_{3} (R = Sm, Gd), CeO_{2}, and CuO were used as raw materials. The content of the CuO flux was changed in the range of 70-78 mol %. An appropriate mixture of R_{2}O_{3}, CeO_{2}, and CuO was charged in a platinum crucible and heated to 1200-1300 ^{\circ}C in an electric furnace. After being held at that temperature for 5 h, it was cooled to 1000-1120 ^{\circ}C at the rate of 1 ^{\circ}C/h, and the furnace was turned off to cool the crucible to room temperature. Crystals were removed mechanically from the flux. To induce superconductivity, specimens of Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} were annealed at 950 ^{\circ}C in flowing argon gas. Oxygen deficiency was characterized by iodometry and thermogravimetric analysis. Oxygen deficiency \delta in the specimens of Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} was kept in the range of 0.03-0.04 by controlling the annealing time from 4 to 24 h.

The chemical composition of the crystals was determined by electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA) using wavelength dispersive spectrometers. The crystal structure was characterized by x-ray powder diffraction and subsequent refinement of the diffraction data using the Rietveld method. The crystallographic directions were determined by the x-ray Laue backreflection method. The Ce concentration in the crystals was also confirmed using the relation between the lattice constants and Ce concentration obtained using polycrystalline specimens. Magnetization measurements were performed at temperatures from 2 to 300 K using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer in applied magnetic fields from 5 Oe to 50 kOe. Electrical resistivity was measured by a dc four-probe method at temperatures from 10 to 300 K. Electrical contacts were established by attaching gold wires (50 \mum) onto the _ab_ plane using silver paint with subsequent annealing in an argon atmosphere at 350 ^{\circ}C for 4 h.

## III Results and Discussion

### Properties of Sm_{1.88-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta}

Through the refinement of the x-ray diffraction data, it was confirmed that all the crystals of Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} (\delta = 0.03-0.04) have a tetragonal T^{*}-phase structure of space group I4/_mmm_. The refined lattice constants [Fig. 1(a)] and interatomic distances [Fig. 1(b)] of Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} are shown in Fig. 1 as a function of the Gd content x. For specimens with Gd contents of 0 \leq x \leq 1.0, the constants a and c decrease linearly as the Gd content increases. However, they change their behavior above x = 1. The nearest interatomic distances of Cu-R and Cu-Cu show the same Gd-content dependence as those of the lattice constants. This suggests that the crystal lattice of Sm_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} shrinks uniformly by the Gd substitution. The decrease in the lattice parameters appears to be due to the difference in the size of rare-earth ions. Since the ionic radius (0.111 nm) of Gd^{3+} is smaller than that (0.113 nm) of Sm^{3+}, the lattice parameters would decrease as the Gd content increases following Vegard's law. However, the behavior above x = 1 deviates from the law, suggesting that a change occurs in the crystal lattice.

Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of magnetization measured for Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} (x \leq 1) crystals under a magnetic field of 5 Oe applied to the _ab_ plane. (b) Temperature dependence of magnetization measured for Sm_{1.35}Gd_{0.3}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} crystal under a magnetic field of 10 kOe applied to the c axis and _ab_ plane. The inset of the figure shows the data for specimens with 0 \leq x \leq 1.2 at temperatures below 8 K.

  tetragonal crystals. A peak, which resembles the antiferromagnetic transition, is observed when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the c axis. In neutron diffraction studies for Sm_{2}CuO_{4}, it was reported that a long-range antiferromagnetic order of Sm spins was observed in the direction parallel to the c axis at about 6 K. [10, 20] In general, an antiferromagnetic peak appears in the geometry in which antiferromagnetically coupled moments are parallel to the applied magnetic field. Therefore, if the observed magnetization is due to rare-earth moments, the antiferromagnetic order of rare-earth ions must be parallel to the c axis for crystals with high Sm concentration. This is consistent with the result of neutron diffraction studies. The inset of Fig. 2(b) shows the temperature dependence of magnetization measured for specimens with various Gd contents at 10 kOe. The peak (hereafter the peak temperature is referred to as T_{\rm NR}), which is observed for specimens with a Gd content of 0 <= x <= 1, shifts to lower temperatures as the Gd content increases and cannot be observed for specimens with x > 1 at temperatures down to 2 K. This decrease in T_{\rm NR} seems to be due to the preferential direction of rare-earth spins. It is accepted that Sm spins are parallel to the c axis in Sm_{2}CuO_{4}, while Gd spins are parallel to the ab plane in Gd_{2}CuO_{4}. [10, 15] Since Gd spins are perpendicular to Sm spins in the Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} system, the magnetic interaction between Sm and Gd spins must be weaker than that among Sm spins. Therefore, Gd substitution will dilute the magnetic interaction among Sm spins, and T_{\rm NR} due to the Sm spins will then decrease with increasing the content of Gd.

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of magnetization measured for specimens of Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} (_x_ >= 1) under a magnetic field of 5 Oe applied parallel to the ab plane. New magnetic transitions appear in the temperature ranges of 2-10 K and 130-170 K. The magnetization observed for specimens with a Gd content of x > 1 at temperatures between 10 and 170 K is considerably larger than that expected for Cu ions and behaves like a ferromagnet. The transition observed at higher temperatures (130-170 K) is considered to be an antiferromagnetic (or weak-ferromagnetic) transition in the Cu sublattice, which has been observed in the neutron diffraction studies for R_{2}CuO_{4} (_R_ = Nd, Pr, or Sm) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] This transition (hereafter referred to as T_{\rm NCa}) shifts to higher temperatures with increasing the content of Gd. This behavior is consistent with that observed for Sm_{2-x}Gd_{x}CuO_{4-\delta} (Ref. [21]) and seems to be due to the change in the crystal structure, which has been shown in Fig. 1. Since the lattice constants and Cu-Cu distance decrease with increasing content of Gd, T_{\rm NCa} would increase by enhancement of the magnetic interaction between Cu spins. The transitions at temperatures between 6 and 20 K (hereafter the peak temperature is referred to as T_{\rm SR}) shift to higher temperatures as the Gd content increases. The shape of the thermomagnetic curve depends strongly on the Gd content and the intensity of the applied magnetic field. The behavior of magnetization, which is observed for specimens with a Gd content of x > 1 at temperatures between T_{\rm SR} and T_{\rm NCa}, is considered to be due to the weak ferromagnetism in the Cu sublattice. In general, weak ferromagnetism does not occur in magnetic oxides with high crystal symmetry. However, the lattice constants of Sm_{2-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta} change their behavior at about x = 1. This change in the lattice constants seems to have a close relation to the behavior of magnetization. If the crystal lattice starts to distort at about x = 1, weak ferromagnetism may occur through the deterioration of the crystal symmetry. In addition, x = 1 is the critical composition at which Gd ions take over the main role from Sm ions. As mentioned above, in the R_{2}CuO_{4}-type oxides, Sm and Gd spins have an antiferromagnetic order in the directions parallel to the c axis and ab plane, respectively, below Neel temperature. Therefore, although rare-earth spins are paramagnetic at temperatures above T_{\rm NR}, it is likely that Gd spins still remain in the ab plane and affect the weak ferromagnetism through a magnetic interaction between Cu and Gd spins. The decrease in the Cu-R distance, which has been shown in Fig. 1, may enhance the magnetic interaction between the Cu and Gd spins and the weak ferromagnetism. When the Gd content exceeds x = 1.5, another transition appears at temperatures of 2-5 K. This peak (hereafter the peak temperature is referred to as T_{\rm NCa}) appears to be an antiferromagnetic transition in the Gd sublattice. In the magnetic susceptibility, neutron diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and specific heat measurements for Gd_{2}CuO_{4}, a peak due to antiferromagnetic transition in the Gd sublattice has been reported at temperatures between 6 and 9 K when the magnetic field was applied parallel to the CuO_{2} plane (or ab plane). [12, 15, 16, 22, 23, 24] Therefore, it is considered that, in the Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} system, the antiferromagnetic order of Sm spins, which is parallel to the c axis, is suppressed by the Gd substitution and a new antiferromagnetic order due to Gd spins appears in the ab plane as the Gd content increases over x = 1. Details of these transitions at T_{\rm SR} and T_{\rm NGd} will be given in the next section.

  stant, respectively. \Theta = - 4.17 K and C = 0.085 were obtained by fitting the above equation to the data. The fitting was also done for specimens with various Gd contents. Figure 4(b) shows the asymptotic Curie temperature \Theta and the effective paramagnetic moment P_{\rm eff}, which is deduced from the Curie constant C, as a function of Gd content x. Here \Theta is always negative, and its absolute value increases as the Gd content increases. This result suggests that the antiferromagnetic interaction among rare-earth ions is enhanced by the Gd substitution. Since the magnetic moment of the Gd ion is lager than that of the Sm ion, the exchange interaction between rare-earth ions must be enhanced. On the other hand, P_{\rm eff} is considerably large and increases as the Gd content increases. It is well known that the magnetic moment of the Cu ion is very small in R_{2}CuO_{4}-type oxides. Therefore, the P_{\rm eff} observed for Sm_{2-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta} can be attributed to the magnetic moment of rare-earth ions. The values of P_{\rm eff} agree well with those calculated by assuming the theoretical magnetic moments of 0.84\mu_{B} and 7.94\mu_{B} for Sm^{3+} and Gd^{3+}, respectively.

### Properties of Gd_{2-y}Ce_{y}CuO_{4-\delta}

Figure 5(a) shows the Ce-content dependence of tetragonal lattice parameters a and c for specimens of Gd_{2-y}Ce_{y}CuO_{4-\delta}. Data for single crystals with a Ce content of y\leq0.15 are shown, together with those for polycrystals with a nominal Ce content of y>0.15. The lattice parameters a and c are almost constant for specimens with a Ce content of y> 0.15. This is consistent with the result of Ref. 19. Figure 5(b) shows the Ce content dependence of the antiferromagnetic transition temperature T_{\rm NCu} and the spin-reorientation temperature T_{\rm SR}, which were determined from the thermomagnetic curves measured under a magnetic field of 10 Oe. T_{\rm NCu} and T_{\rm SR} decrease to lower temperatures with increasing the content of Ce, however, they approach a fixed value in specimens with a Ce content of y> 0.15. These behaviors are very similar to that of the lattice constant c and suggest that the solubility limit of Ce is found in the vicinity of y = 0.15. It is well known that the Ce ion exists as a nonmagnetic Ce^{4+} ion in the superconducting R_{2-y}Ce_{y}CuO_{4-\delta} (R = Pr, Nd, and Sm). Therefore, it seems natural to consider that the Ce ion exists as a Ce^{4+} ion in Gd_{2-y}Ce_{y}CuO_{4-\delta}. Since the oxygen deficiency has been kept in the range of 0.03-0.04, the valence state of Cu ions must be changed by the substitution of Ce^{4+} ions, and then the nonmagnetic Cu^{+} ion will be introduced. The decrease observed for T_{\rm NCu}(y) and T_{\rm SR}(y) would be due to the valence change of Cu ions.

Figure 6 shows the temperature dependence of the magnetization measured for Gd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta}, which is the end member of the Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} system, under a magnetic field of 10 Oe applied parallel to the c axis and ab plane. The magnetization observed in the c axis is very small and shows a monotonous decrease with increasing the temperature. However, when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the ab plane, distinct magnetic transitions are observed at 4, 10, and 160 K, and as shown in the inset of the figure, the transitions at 4 and 10 K show a thermal hysteresis during the heating and cooling processes. These transitions are hereafter referred to as transitions A, B

  and C, and the phases between these transitions are referred to as phases I, II, III, and IV. Transition A, which has been observed for specimens of Sm1,85-_x_Gd,Ce0.15CuO4-_d_ (_x_  1.6) and characterized by _T_NGd, is an antiferromagnetic transition occurring in the Gd sublattice. On the other hand, transitions B and C, respectively, correspond to the spin-reorientation and the antiferromagnetic transitions, which have been characterized by _T_SR and _T_NCu in the results of the magnetization measurement for Sm1,85-_x_Gd,Ce0.15CuO4-_d_.

Following the theoretical studies of the magnetism of orthorhombic and orthoferrite systems,25 the Hamiltonian of the (Gd,Ce)2CuO4 system is given by \mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}_{\text{Cu}} + \mathcal{H}_{\text{Ca-Gd}} + \mathcal{H}_{\text{Gd}}, where \mathcal{H}_{\text{Ca}}, \mathcal{H}_{\text{Gd}}, and \mathcal{H}_{\text{Ca-Gd}} are the Hamiltonians of Cu and Gd ions and the interaction between Cu and Gd ions, respectively. The Hamiltonian \mathcal{H}_{\text{Cu}} is given by \mathcal{H}_{\text{Cu}} = \mathcal{H}_{\text{iso}} + \mathcal{H}_{\text{anti}} + \mathcal{H}_{\text{symm}} + \mathcal{H}_{\text{am}}, where \mathcal{H}_{\text{iso}}, \mathcal{H}_{\text{am}}i, and \mathcal{H}_{\text{symm}} are the Hamiltonians of the isotropic exchange interaction \Sigma_{i\neq j}\mathcal{H}_{j}\mathbf{S}_{i}^{\text{Ca}}\mathbf{S}_{j}^{\text{Ca}}, the antisymmetric exchange interaction \Sigma_{i\neq j}\mathcal{H}_{j}\mathbf{S}_{i}^{\text{Ca}}\mathbf{\times} \mathbf{S}_{i}^{\text{Ca}}, and the anisotropic-symmetric exchange interactions \Sigma_{i\neq j}\mathbf{S}_{i}^{\text{Ca}}\mathbf{\cdot}\mathbf{\cdot}\mathbf{S}_{j}^{\text{Ca}} between Cu ions, respectively, and \mathcal{H}_{\text{am}} is the one-ion anisotropy energy DS_{z}^{2} + E(S_{x}^{2} - S_{y}^{2}) of Cu ions. Therefore, the Hamiltonian \mathcal{H}_{\text{Cu}} is further given by

\[\mathcal{H}_{\text{Cu}} = \sum_{i\neq j}\,\left(J_{ij}\mathbf{S}_{i}^{\text{Cu}}\mathbf{S}_{j}^{\text{Cu}}\mathbf{+}\mathbf{D}_{ij}\cdot\mathbf{S}_{i}^{\text{Cu}}\mathbf{\times}\mathbf{S}_{j}^{\text{Cu}}\mathbf{+}\mathbf{S}_{i}^{\text{Cu}}\mathbf{\cdot}\mathbf{a}_{ij}\cdot\mathbf{S}_{j}^{\text{Cu}}\right)\] \[+ DS_{z}^{2} + E(S_{x}^{2} - S_{y}^{2}).\]

At temperatures between _T_NCu and _T_SR, the easy axis of magnetization of Cu spins is determined by the one-ion magnetic anisotropy of Cu ions, the Cu spins are aligned antiferromagnetically along the [110] direction by the isotropic exchange interaction, and a weak-ferromagnetic moment is induced by the antisymmetric exchange interaction (or Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction [26]), which tilts Cu spins toward the [001] direction (overt canting) and spreads them out along the _ab_ plane (hidden canting). However, x-ray diffraction studies have revealed that Gd1,85Ce0.15CuO4 has a tetragonal structure of space group I4/_mmm_, and weak ferromagnetism due to the antisymmetric exchange interaction cannot be expected for crystals with a high symmetry such as I4/_mmm_. Although the existence and the effect of local distortion have been proposed to explain the occurrence of weak ferromagnetism in Gd2CuO4 and related oxides, [12, 16, 27, 28, 29] the details of the distortion and magnetism in Gd1,85Ce0.15CuO4 still remained unclear. Figure 7 shows the electron diffraction pattern for the (001) plane (or the _ab_ plane) of a Gd1,85Ce0.15CuO4 crystal. Small extra spots are observed among clear main spots. This is strong evidence of a lattice distortion existing in Gd1,85Ce0.15CuO4 crystals. The diffraction pattern can be explained by assuming the orthorhombic space group _Bmab_. A small distortion of the oxygen site in the _ab_ plane is considered to deteriorate the crystal symmetry. The orthorhombic lattice parameter _a*_ (or _b*_) of space group _Bmab_ has a relation of _a*_ =_b_2a with tetragonal lattice parameter a of space group I4/_mmm_. Possible lattice distortion models that explain the electron diffraction pattern with orthorhombic symmetry are shown in Fig. 7. Each model has an alternative lattice distortion in the CuO2 plane; however, the position of Cu ions is independent of the lattice distortion. Among these models, (b) most likely exists in Gd1,85Ce0.15CuO4 crystals. When the middle point (point _M_) of a line between Cu ions is the center of inversion symmetry, **D** is equal to zero. This is the case for tetragonal crystals of space group I4/_mmm_. Since the point M is a center of inversion symmetry, weak ferromagnetism due to the antisymmetric exchange interaction cannot be expected. However, when a lattice distortion occurs in a tetragonal crystal and the crystal has an orthorhombic structure of space group _Bmab_, weak ferromagnetism may occur in Gd1,85Ce0.15CuO4 since point M is no longer a center of inversion symmetry. Therefore, the magnetism observed at temperatures between _T_SR and _T_NCu (phase III) is considered to be weak ferromagnetism.

Figure 8(a) shows the temperature dependence of magnetization measured for the same crystal under various magnetic fields applied parallel to the c axis. In this case, al

  though a small anomaly is observed at about 10 K, magnetization shows a monotonous decrease as the temperature is increased. Figure 8(b) shows the temperature dependence of magnetization measured under various magnetic fields applied parallel to the _ab_ plane. Transitions observed at low temperatures are affected considerably by the applied magnetic field. When the field intensity is increased, transition B (at _T_SR), at which the antiferromagnetic spin configuration in the Cu sublattice is reoriented to form a weak-ferromagnetic order, shifts to lower temperatures and coincides with transition A (at _T_NGd) at an applied field of \sim2 kOe to form a single peak near 6 K. When a magnetic field over 3 kOe is applied, the peak becomes indistinct; furthermore, magnetization increases monotonously with descending the temperature, and a shoulder is observed near 6 K. A magnetic phase diagram for a specimen of Gd1.85Ce0.15CuO4 at low temperature is shown in Fig. 8(c). In the phase between _T_SR and _T_NGd, Cu and Gd spins are considered to exist in an antiferromagnetic and a paramagnetic state, respectively. This phase disappears at a magnetic field above 2 kOe. This seems to be due to a field-induced spin reorientation of Cu spins. When the field intensity increases, the antiferromagnetically ordered Cu spins, which are very sensitive to the applied magnetic field, reorient to form a weak-ferromagnetic spin configuration, which is the same magnetic structure as that in phase III. The decrease in _T_SR(_H_) is attributed to the expansion of the weak-ferromagnetic phase (phase III) to lower temperatures with the assistance of the applied magnetic field. On the other hand, paramagnetic Gd spins in phase II are aligned by an internal magnetic field, which is induced by the formation of a weak-ferromagnetic spin configuration in the Cu sublattice through field-induced spin reorientation, and make a great contribution to the magnetization. This is why magnetization in phase II increases as the applied field increases.

The magnetization observed in the _ab_ plane at temperatures between _T_SR and _T_NCu is considerably larger than that expected for Cu ions. The magnetization is attributed to the moment of Gd ions. Figures 9(a) and 9(b) show the temperature dependence of reciprocal magnetic susceptibility \chi^{-1} measured in various magnetic fields applied parallel to the _ab_ plane and c axis, respectively. The \chi^{-1}(T) shows linear temperature dependence at temperatures between 10 and 150 K, and the linear part of the curve can be fitted by the Curie-Weiss law. Figure 9(c) shows the field dependence of effective magnetic moment _P_eff, which is calculated from the Curie constant obtained by the fitting. _P_eff decreases considerably at a low magnetic field and approaches the constant value (\sim 7.9\mu_{B}) at higher magnetic fields. This value is consistent with the theoretical value (7.94\mu_{B}) for the free Gd ion. From the results shown in Figs. 8 and 9, it is supposed that, in phase III, the paramagnetic moments of Gd ions are aligned by an internal magnetic field induced by a spontaneous magnetization of Gd ions. The magnetic moment of Gd ions is \sim 1.5 kOe, \sim 1.5 kOe, and \sim 1.5 kOe. The magnetic moment of Gd ions is \sim 1.

  ous weak-ferromagnetic (WF) moment that is brought on by a canting of antiferromagnetically coupled moments of Cu ions. Taking the theoretical considerations by Yamaguchi for _RM_O3 (_R_ = rare earth, M = Fe or Cr) into account, the Hamiltonian of the interaction between Cu and Gd ions in the (Gd,Ce)2CuO4 system would be represented by

\[{\cal H}_{\rm Cu-Gd} = {\sum\limits_{i \neq j}}\ ({\bar{J}}_{ij}{\bf S}_{i}^{\rm Cu} \cdot {\bf S}_{j}^{\rm Gd} + {\bf{\bar{D}}}_{ij} \cdot {\bf S}_{i}^{\rm Cu} \times {\bf S}_{i}^{\rm Gd} + {\bf S}_{i}^{\rm Cu} \cdot {\bf{\bar{a}}}_{ij} \cdot {\bf S}_{j}^{\rm Gd} )\]

using the isotropic, the antisymmetric, and the anisotropo-symmetric exchange interactions between Cu and Gd ions.[25] Gd spins are aligned antiparallel to the weak-ferromagnetic moment through the interaction {\Sigma}_{i \neq j}{\bar{J}}_{ij}{\bf S}_{i}^{\rm Cu} \cdot {\bf S}_{j}^{\rm Gd}. This interaction can be represented in terms of an interaction between an effective magnetic field H_{i} and the spin moment of the Gd ion, which is given by E = - \alpha M_{\rm Cu}M_{\rm Gd} = - H_{i}M_{\rm Gd}. This effective field corresponds to the internal field mentioned above. When the spin moment of the rare-earth ion increases as the temperature is lowered, the isotropic exchange interaction {\Sigma}_{i \neq j}{\bar{J}}_{ij}{\bf S}_{i}^{\rm Cu} \cdot {\bf S}_{j}^{R} is enhanced, and then the effective magnetic field H_{i} is increased. The magnitude of the WF moment as well as the canting angle depends on the intensity of the applied magnetic field. When the WF moment is enhanced by the applied magnetic field and Gd moments are aligned completely in the direction of internal magnetic field, the effective moment _P_eff becomes constant. This must be why large magnetization is observed in the _ab_ plane at temperatures between _T_SR and _T_NCu, the magnetization depending strongly on the Gd content and the intensity of the applied magnetic field.

In order to describe the magnetism of Gd1.85Ce0.15CuO4 in detail, the field dependence of magnetization was measured at some characteristic temperatures in phases I, II, III, and IV. Figure 10(a) shows the field dependence of magnetization measured for Gd1.85Ce0.15CuO4 at 200 K in phase IV by applying a magnetic field parallel to the _ab_ plane. The _M_(_H_) curve shows linear and reversible field dependence, suggesting the existence of paramagnetism at temperatures above _T_NCu (or transition _C_). This behavior is independent of the field direction. Figure 10(b) shows magnetization curves _M_(_H_) measured at various temperatures in phase III under a magnetic field applied parallel to the [100] direction in the _ab_ plane (hereafter direction is represented by the tetragonal symmetry of space group _I4/mmm_). The magnetization tends to be saturated at a very low magnetic field (_H_ < 200 Oe) and shows linear field dependence at higher magnetic fields. In addition, a magnetic hysteresis was observed in the _M_(_H_) curves. The _M_(_H_) curves in the [110] direction show the same behavior as those in the [100] direction. This behavior of the _M_(_H_) curves resembles that of weak ferromagnetism. When weak ferromagnetism is established in Gd1.85Ce0.15CuO4, the _M_(_H_) curve is represented by

\[M(H) = M_{\rm Cu} + C_{\rm Gd}\frac{H_{i} + H}{T + \Theta},\]

where _M_Cu, _C_Gd, H_{i}, and _Th_ are the spontaneous weak-ferromagnetic moment induced by a canting of Cu spins, the Curie constant of Gd, the internal field acting on Gd sites, and the asymptotic Curie temperature, respectively.[30]_C_Cu has been ignored because _C_Gd appears to be much larger than _C_Cu. H_{i} and _M_Cu can be determined from the _M_(_H_) curves measured at different temperatures between 20 and 130 K using Eq. (1). The extrapolation of the linear portion of _M_(_H_) curves, which are measured at neighboring temperatures, intersects at a point, indicating H = H_{i} and M = _M_Cu. Here H_{i} = - 426 Oe and _M_Cu = (4.2x10-3)_m_B were obtained from the _M_(_H_) curves measured at 20 and 50 K. The negative sign of H_{i} indicates that the internal field acting on the Gd site is antiparallel to the direction of the applied magnetic field. These values are consistent with those reported for Gd2CuO4.[19,23,31,32] Since paramagnetic Gd moments are aligned by H_{i}, significantly large magnetization can be observed even in a low applied magnetic field of 10 Oe. Here H_{i} at each temperature can be estimated by neglecting the _M_Cu in Eq. (1). In this case, a point where the linear extrapolation of the _M_(_H_) curve intersects the abscissa gives H_{i}. The absolute value of H_{i} is shown in Fig. 11(a) as a function of the temperature. H_{i} shows a remarkable decrease in the vicinity of _T_NCu. Moreover, it is seen that H_{i} along the c axis is about one-tenth of that in the _ab_ plane. These facts apparently indicate that the WF moment, which is due to a canting of Cu moments, exists in the _ab_ plane at temperatures between _T_SR and _T_NCu. Figure 11(b) shows the Gd-content dependence of H_{i} obtained for specimens of Sm1.85-xGd,Ce0.15CuO4-_g_ at 50 K by applying a magnetic field parallel to the [100] direction. H_{i} appears for specimens with a Gd content of x > 1, while the superconductivity disappears for these specimens. Although the occurrence of weak ferromagnetism is attributed to the lattice distortion

Figure 10: (a) Field dependence of magnetization measured for Gd1.85Ce0.15CuO4−_δ_ crystal at 200 K by applying a magnetic field parallel to the _ab_ plane and (b) field dependence of magnetization measured at various temperatures in phase III under a magnetic field applied parallel to the [100] direction in the _ab_ plane.

  that is caused by the Gd substitution, the role of the magnetic interaction between Cu and Gd cannot be disregarded. Unlike Sm spins, which are parallel to the c axis and perpendicular to the Cu spins, Gd spins seem to exist in the ab plane, at which weak-ferromagnetic Cu spins exist; thus, the magnetic interaction between Cu and Gd spins is expected to be much stronger than that between Cu and Sm spins. Therefore, the magnetic interaction between Cu and Gd may contribute to the occurrence of weak ferromagnetism and the suppression of superconductivity observed for specimens of Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} (x< 1).

Figure 12 shows the angular dependence of magnetization measured for Gd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4} at 3, 6, and 20 K, respectively, in phases I, II, and III under a magnetic field of 20 Oe applied parallel to the ab plane.

Here \theta is an angle from the [100] direction. Magnetization shows anisotropic behavior at 3 and 20 K, and the maximum and minimum are observed at angles that correspond to the \langle 110\rangle and \langle 100\rangle directions, respectively. However, the difference between the maximum and minimum is much smaller at 3 K than at 20 K. On the other hand, there is little angular dependence at 6 K. The M(\theta) curve at 20 K can be explained qualitatively assuming a single magnetic domain. In the domain, antiferromagnetically coupled Cu spins align parallel to one of the \langle 110\rangle directions, and a slight canting of the spins from the \langle 110\rangle direction induces a spontaneous WF moment in the direction perpendicular to the Cu spins. Paramagnetic Gd spins are aligned in the direction of internal magnetic field H_{i}, which is induced by the WF moment. Since the magnetic moment of Cu ions is negligibly smaller than that of Gd ions, magnetization due to Gd spins, which are aligned by H_{i}, can be observed in the magnetization measurement. When the applied magnetic field is rotated from the [110] direction and goes across the [010] direction, the spontaneous WF moment lying in the [110] direction switches to the [\,\overline{1} 10] direction, which is the nearest direction to the applied field. Since the switching occurs under an applied field that is much smaller than the internal magnetic field H_{i}, a maximum and minimum of magnetization must be observed when the magnetic field of 20 Oe is applied parallel to the \langle 110\rangle and \langle 100\rangle directions, respectively.

  ing a magnetic field to the [001] (=_c_ axis), [100], and [\bar{1}10] directions in the _ab_ plane. The _M_(_H_) curve in the [001] direction shows a linear field dependence, while those in the [100] and [\bar{1}10] directions change their slope at _H__c_1 = 0.5 kOe and _H__c_2 = 1.8 kOe. This seems to be a field-induced magnetic phase transition that begins near 0.5 kOe and finishes at about 1.8 kOe. The magnetic susceptibility measured in the [100] (or [\bar{1}10]) direction above and below 1.8 kOe is _x_high = 9.66x10-3 emu/cm3 and _x_low = 11.48 x 10-3 emu/cm3, respectively. The inset of the figure shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility measured in the [100] direction at temperatures in phase III. It is seen that the _x_high at 6 K agrees well with the extrapolation of the _kh_(_T_) curve measured above 10 K. Therefore, it is likely that the antiferromagnetic configuration of Cu spins in phase II, changes into the same canted spin arrangement as that in phase III at magnetic fields between _H__c_1 and _H__c_2. On the other hand, Gd spins appear to be paramagnetic in phase II at magnetic fields below _H__c_1. This is clear from the result shown in Fig. 12, in which no angular dependence is observed at 6 K under a field of 20 Oe. However, when the canted spin configuration of Cu ions is established at magnetic fields above _H__c_2, paramagnetic Gd spins align in the direction of H_{i}, which is induced by the WF moment, and contribute to the magnetization of the specimen. Figure 13(b) shows the Gd-content dependence of the critical field _H__c_2 obtained for specimens of Sm1.85-xGdACe0.13CuO4-_d_ at 6 K. Here _H__c_2 increases monotonously above _x_> 1, suggesting that the antiferromagnetic configuration of Cu spins in phase II becomes more stable to the applied field by the Gd substitution. The magnetic interaction between Cu and Gd spins seems to stabilize the antiferromagnetic spin configuration of Cu ions and suppress the field-induced spin-reorientation transition from an antiferromagnetic to a weak-ferromagnetic state.

Figure 14 shows the field dependence of magnetization measured for Gd1.85Ce0.15CuO4 at 3 K in phase I by applying a magnetic field to the [100], [\bar{1}10], and [001] directions. The magnetization in the [100] and [\bar{1}10] directions rises remarkably as the applied field increases and tends to be saturated at about 200 Oe. However, the magnetization shows a linear field dependence with a further increase in the magnetic field, and jumps are observed at 1.8 and 2.7 kOe, respectively, in the [\bar{1}10] and [100] directions. Moreover, the _M_(_H_) curve changes its slope before and after the jumps. On the other hand, the _M_(_H_) curve in the [001] direction shows linear field dependence up to 50 kOe. The behavior of the _M_(_H_) curves is explained qualitatively by a model in which Cu, spins align antiferromagnetically in the axis parallel to the [110] direction, inducing a spontaneous WF moment in the [\bar{1}10] direction, while Gd spins align antiferromagnetically in the axis parallel to the [\bar{1}10] direction. The weak-ferromagnetic spin configuration in the Cu sublattice is the same as that of phase III. In this case, the field dependence of magnetization is given by

\[M(H) = M_{\text{Cu}} + (\chi_{\text{Cu}} + \chi_{\text{Gd}})H,\]

where _M_Cu, _X_Cu, and _X_Gd are the spontaneous WF moment due to Cu spins and the antiferromagnetic susceptibility of Cu and Gd sublattices, respectively. The initial increase in the _M_(_H_) curve is attributed to the _M_Cu, and a single-domain structure is attained in this process. When a magnetic field H with an intensity below 1.8 kOe is applied to the [\bar{1}10] direction, a WF moment due to canting Cu spins aligns in the [\bar{1}10] direction. On the other hand, antiferromagnetic Gd spins align in the axis parallel to the [\bar{1}10] direction with a slight tilting of an antiferromagnetic component, which is antiparallel to the applied field, from [1\bar{1}0] towards the direction of the applied field H. In this case, (_X_Cu + \chi_{\text{Gd}}) must be used instead of (_X_Cu + \chi_{\text{Gd}}) in Eq. (2). Since _X_Cu seems to be larger than _X_Gd, the contribution of _X_Cu would be dominant in this field range. The magnetization jump observed in the [\bar{1}10] direction at 1.8 kOe is considered to be a flop of antiferromagnetic Gd spins from a parallel to a perpendicular spin arrangement regarding the direction of the applied field. In this case, the critical field H_{c} for spin flopping of antiferromagnetically coupled Gd spins is given by

\[H_{c} = \sqrt{\frac{2K}{\chi_{\text{Gd}\bot} - \chi_{\text{Gd}\|}}},\]

where K is the anisotropy constant and _kh_Gd,1 and _X_Gd are perpendicular and parallel magnetic susceptibilities, respectively. In the geometry in which a magnetic field is applied to the [\bar{1}10] direction, the field-dependent term in Eq. (2) is given by (_X_Cu + \chi_{\text{Gd}\bot})_H_ at magnetic fields above 1.8 kOe. Therefore, since (_X_Gd - \chi_{\text{Gd}\|}) is obtained by subtracting (_X_Cu + \chi_{\text{Gd}\|}) from (_X_Cu + \chi_{\text{Gd}\bot}), the anisotropy constant K can be estimated using Eq. (3). Here K = 6.05 x103 erg/cm3 was obtained by using H_{c} = 1.8 kOe, (_kh_Cu + \chi_{\text{Gd}\|} = 6.49\times 10^{- 3} emu/cm3, and (_X_Cu + \chi_{\text{Gd}\|} = 1.02\times 10^{3} emu/cm3. On the other hand, a magnetization jump is observed at 2.7 kOe when a magnetic field is applied to the [100] direction. In this geometry, the field component in the [\bar{1}10] direction causes the spin flopping, and the component is given by H110=_H_ cos _th_, where _th_ is the angle between H and the [\bar{1}10] direction. When _th_ = _p_/4 rad and H = 2.7 kOe

  were used, H_{110}=1.9 kOe was deduced. This value is consistent with the critical field H_{c} (=1.8 kOe) for the spin flopping observed in the [\,\overline{1}\,10] direction. Moreover, this model is consistent with the angular dependence observed in the M\left(\theta\right) at 3 K (Fig. 12). Since the ground state of Gd^{3+} is ^{8}S_{7/22} and, consequently, large one-ion magnetic anisotropy cannot be expected, the antiferromagnetic order in the Gd sublattice would be considerably affected by the applied magnetic field and the magnetism in the Cu sublattice.

The magnetic structure in Gd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4} crystals can be estimated by taking the crystal symmetry into account. When the four basis vectors of \mathbf{F}=\mathbf{S}_{1}+\mathbf{S}_{2}+\mathbf{S}_{3}+\mathbf{S}_{4}, \mathbf{G}=\mathbf{S}_{1}-\mathbf{S}_{2}+\mathbf{S}_{3}-\mathbf{S}_{4}, \mathbf{C}=\mathbf{S}_{1}+\mathbf{S}_{2}-\mathbf{S}_{3}-\mathbf{S}_{4}, and \mathbf{A}=\mathbf{S}_{1}-\mathbf{S}_{2}-\mathbf{S}_{3}+\mathbf{S}_{4} are considered for the Cu(4_a_) sites of _Bmab_, irreducible representations of these vectors are obtained following Bertaut's representation theory.[33] The irreducible representations of the basis vectors for Cu(4_a_) sites are shown in Table 1. Since the components of basis vectors in the same representation can be coupled, a canted spin structure is attained. In these representations, antiferromagnetically coupled sublattice moments must be parallel to the [110] direction in \Gamma_{1}, \Gamma_{3}, and \Gamma_{4} and parallel to the [001] direction in \Gamma_{2}, and a spontaneous WF moment can be observed along the [110], [\,\overline{1}\,10], and [001] directions in \Gamma_{2}, \Gamma_{3}, and \Gamma_{4}, respectively. According to the results of magnetic measurements mentioned above, Cu-sublattice moments are always parallel to the [110] direction regardless of the different magnetic phases, and a WF moment is parallel to the [\,\overline{1}\,10] direction in phases I and III. Therefore, among the representations, \Gamma_{3} is consistent with the magnetism in phases I and III, and \Gamma_{1} is consistent with the magnetism of phase II at a low magnetic field. Possible spin configurations in these magnetic phases are shown in Fig. 15. Antiferromagnetically coupled sublattice moments of Gd are parallel to the [\,\overline{1}\,10] direction at a low magnetic field at 3 K in phase I and paramagnetic at 6 and 20 K, respectively, in phase II and III. However, when a magnetic field with high intensity is applied to the [\,\overline{1}\,10] direction, the antiferromagnetic sublattice moments of Gd flop and become parallel to the [110] direction in phase I, and the spin configuration of Cu ions in phase II transforms from \Gamma_{1} to \Gamma_{3} through a field-induced spin-reorientation transition, inducing a spontaneous WF moment of Cu spins along the [\,\overline{1}\,10] direction. In the thermomagnetic curve shown in the inset of Fig. 6, a thermal hysteresis was observed at transitions A and B. Since the thermal hysteresis is a typical characteristic of the first-order phase transition, the phase transition between antiferromagnetic \Gamma_{1} and weak-ferromagnetic \Gamma_{3} phases appears to be a first-order phase transition. The isotropic exchange interaction between Cu and Gd ions is thought to play a key role in the spin reorientation at T_{\rm SR}. When the spin moment of the Gd ion increases at low temperature and then the isotropic exchange interaction \Sigma_{i+\mu}\vec{J}_{i}\vec{S}_{j}^{\rm Cu}\cdot\mathbf{S}_{j}^{\rm Gd} (or the interaction energy between Cu spins and H_{i}) is enhanced and exceeds the anisotropy energy of Cu ions at a specific temperature (=T_{\rm SR}), the Cu spins undergo a spontaneous spin reorientation similar to that observed in the orthoferrites and orthochromites. Since Gd^{3+} is an S-state ion, the anisotropy energy of the Gd ion gives little contribution to the spin reorientation. It is important to the occurrence of the spin reorientation that the exchange coefficients \vec{D} and \vec{a} be comparable to the anisotropy constant K. This type of spin reorientation was observed for DyFeO_{3}.[34] DyFeO_{3} shows a spin-reorientation transition from the low-temperature antiferromagnetic to the high-temperature weak-ferromagnetic spin configuration at about 30 K, and the magnetization shows a sharp increase. In the antiferromagnetic phase, no ferromagnetism is associated with the spin configuration of Fe^{3+} spins, and the spin moment of Dy^{3+} has therefore been considered to be paramagnetic. The abrupt (first-order) spin reorientation has been considered to be due to the isotropic interaction \Sigma_{i+\mu}\vec{J}_{i}\vec{S}_{j}^{\rm Fe}\cdot\mathbf{S}_{j}^{\rm Dy} between the Fe^{3+} and Dy^{3+} sublattices.[25]

## IV Conclusion

The magnetic properties of Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\beta} and Gd_{2-x}Ce_{y}CuO_{4-\delta} systems were investigated, and the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism was studied. All the transitions observed in the

  Sm1,85-_x_Gd,Ce0.15CuO4 system are summarized in Fig. 16 as a function of Gd content. A superconducting transition is observed for specimens with a Gd content of 0 <= x x <= 1.1. Sm spins have an antiferromagnetic order along the [001] direction below Neel temperature _T_NR (~5 K for x = 0), which is observed for specimens of x <= 1 at high field intensity. The _T_NR as well as the superconducting transition temperature _T_c decreases with increasing Gd content and disappears for specimens of x > 1.1. Successive magnetic transitions appear at about 3, 7, and 135 K as the Gd content increases over x = 1.1. Although Cu spins have an antiferromagnetic order along the [110] direction among these transitions, a weak-ferromagnetic moment which is due to a canting of the Cu spins appears along the [\begin{equation*}{\bar{\top}}10\end{equation*}] direction at temperatures of T <= 3 K (phase I) and 7 K <= T <= 135 K (phase III). The antiferromagnetic configuration of Cu spins at 3 K < T < 7 K (phase II) is affected by the external field and changes into a weak-ferromagnetic spin configuration, which is the same structure as that in phase III, via field-induced spin reorientation. The transition at 7 K is a temperature-induced spin-reorientation transition between antiferromagnetic (phase II) and weak-ferromagnetic (phase III) spin configurations in the Cu sublattice. The reorientation temperature _T_SR, which is observed at very low field intensity, shifts to higher temperatures with increasing x. On the other hand, the transition at 3 K is an antiferromagnetic transition in the Gd sublattice. The transition, which is characterized by Neel temperature _T_NGd and is observed for x > 1.5, shifts to higher temperatures with increasing Gd content. With the formation of an antiferromagnetic order in the Gd sublattice, Cu spins reorient from an antiferromagnetic (_T_ >= _T_NGd) to a weak-ferromagnetic (_T_ <= _T_NGd) configuration. Peaks at _T_NGd and _T_SR are sensitive to the magnetic field: they merge at about 2 kOe and disappear at a magnetic field of about 10 kOe.

The results of this study suggest that Gd substitution changes the magnetic structure of host material Sm1,85Ce0.15CuO4 and suppresses superconductivity. The suppression of the superconductivity is attributed to the geometry of rare-earth and Cu spins. In Sm1,85Ce0.15CuO4, antiferromagnetically coupled Sm spins are parallel to the [001] direction and perpendicular to the Cu spins, which couple antiferromagnetically in the _ab_ plane, while, in Gd1,85Ce0.15CuO4, both Gd and Cu spins are parallel to the _ab_ plane. Since the exchange interaction between rare-earth and Cu spins in the same plane must be stronger than that of a perpendicular spin configuration, the fluctuation of Cu spins must be suppressed by the interaction, and the superconductivity of Sm1,85Ce0.15CuO4 would thus be suppressed by the Gd substitution.

###### Abstract

The magnetism and superconductivity of Sm1,85-_x_Gd_Ce0.15CuO4-_d_ and Gd2-_Y_Ce_y_CuO4-_d_ crystals were investigated. In the Sm1,85-_x_Gd_Ce0.15CuO4-_d_ system, superconductivity is suppressed by Gd substitution, and temperature-induced magnetic transitions appear at 3, 7, and 135 K above x = 1.2 Cu spins have an antiferromagnetic (AF) order along the [110] direction among these transitions, and a weak-ferromagnetic (WF) moment due to a canting of Cu spins appears along the [\overline{1}10] direction at T  3 K and 7 K  T  135 K. The AF order at 3 K  T  7 K changes into a canted spin configuration via field-induced spin reorientation and induces the WF moment. The Neel temperature _T_NC, (135 K at x = 1.2) and spin-reorientation temperature _T_SR (7 K at x = 1.2), which are due to the Cu sublattice and are observed at low field intensity, increase with increasing x. Sm spins have an antiferromagnetic order along the [001] direction at x = 0 below the Neel temperature _T_NR (~5 K), but _T_NR , which is observed for low x at high field intensity, decreases with increasing x and disappears at x  1. Gd spins have an antiferromagnetic order along the [\overline{1}10] direction for specimens with x > 1.4 near 3 K. The change in the geometry of rare-earth and Cu spins resulting from Gd substitution is considered to be the reason for the suppression of superconductivity.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in R2-_Y_Ce_y_CuO4-_d_ (_R_ = Pr, Nd, Sm, or Eu) systems aroused considerable attention since these were the only copper oxide systems showing electron-type superconductivity.1 The parent insulating compound R2CuO4 crystallizes in a tetragonal structure (_T_' phase) in which the copper ions are surrounded by a square planar arrangement of oxygen ions. The existence of an antiferromagnetic order in the Cu sublattice has been revealed for R2CuO4 (_R_ = Pr, Nd, Sm, or Gd) by neutron diffraction.2-12 The antiferromagnetic order of Cu spins in the CuO2 plane occurs at a temperature between 200 and 300 K. When R3+ is replaced with Ce4+, negative carriers are injected into the CuO2 plane to compensate the valence of rare-earth sites, and the antiferromagnetic order disappears in accordance with the carrier doping; in addition, superconductivity with a transition temperature as high as 24 K appears at a Ce content of y = 0.15. On the other hand, the existence of an antiferromagnetic order in the rare-earth sublattice was revealed for R2CuO4 (_R_ = Nd, Sm, or Gd); moreover, the coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism of rare-earth ions has been suggested.8,10,12-16 R_{2-y}Ce_{y}CuO_{4-\delta} systems seem interesting to study the correlation between superconductivity in the Cu sublattice and antiferromagnetism in the rare-earth sublattice.

In the _T_'-type oxides of R2-_Y_Ce_y_CuO4-_d_ (_R_ = Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, or Gd), superconductivity is not observed when R is Gd. Since the Gd ion has the maximum magnetic moment (~8_m__B_) among the rare-earth ions in _T_'-type oxides, the magnetism of the Gd ion seems to make a considerable contribution to the suppression of superconductivity through a magnetic interaction between rare-earth and copper ions. In order to clarify the reason for the absence of superconductivity in the Gd2-_Y_Ce_y_CuO4-_d_ system, the superconductivity and magnetism of the Sm1,85-_x_Gd_Ce0.15CuO4-_d_ system were studied, and a possible contribution of the magnetism of Gd ions to the suppression of superconductivity was suggested; moreover, the existence of peculiar successive magnetic transitions, which are observed for specimens with high Gd content and sensitive to the applied magnetic field, was reported.17,18 The absence of superconductivity was also studied in the Gd2-_Y_Ce_y_CuO4-_d_ system through magnetic measurement, and the role of an antiferromagnetic order in the Cu sublattice was suggested;19 however, the reason for the absence as well as the intrinsic magnetic properties of the system seems as yet unclear. Since the magnetic properties of these materials are very sensitive to the intensity of the applied magnetic field, intrinsic magnetic properties must be studied using a very low magnetic field. Although the Gd2-_Y_Ce_y_CuO4-_d_ system may be a key material for the study, it seems important to study the Sm1,85-_x_Gd_Ce0.15CuO4-_d_ system using single crystals under a wide range of applied magnetic fields for clarifying the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in _T_'-type oxides. In the present study, the superconducting and magnetic properties of Sm1,85-_x_Gd_Ce0.15CuO4-_d_ crystals were investigated and compared with those of Gd2-_Y_Ce_y_CuO4-_d_ crystals.

## II Experiment

Single crystals of Sm1,85-_x_Gd_Ce0.15CuO4-_d_ and Gd2-_Y_Ce_y_CuO4-_d_ were prepared by the self-flux method us ing excess CuO as a flux. High-purity (99.9%) oxide powders of R_{2}O_{3} (R = Sm, Gd), CeO_{2}, and CuO were used as raw materials. The content of the CuO flux was changed in the range of 70-78 mol %. An appropriate mixture of R_{2}O_{3}, CeO_{2}, and CuO was charged in a platinum crucible and heated to 1200-1300 ^{\circ}C in an electric furnace. After being held at that temperature for 5 h, it was cooled to 1000-1120 ^{\circ}C at the rate of 1 ^{\circ}C/h, and the furnace was turned off to cool the crucible to room temperature. Crystals were removed mechanically from the flux. To induce superconductivity, specimens of Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} were annealed at 950 ^{\circ}C in flowing argon gas. Oxygen deficiency was characterized by iodometry and thermogravimetric analysis. Oxygen deficiency \delta in the specimens of Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} was kept in the range of 0.03-0.04 by controlling the annealing time from 4 to 24 h.

The chemical composition of the crystals was determined by electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA) using wavelength dispersive spectrometers. The crystal structure was characterized by x-ray powder diffraction and subsequent refinement of the diffraction data using the Rietveld method. The crystallographic directions were determined by the x-ray Laue backreflection method. The Ce concentration in the crystals was also confirmed using the relation between the lattice constants and Ce concentration obtained using polycrystalline specimens. Magnetization measurements were performed at temperatures from 2 to 300 K using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer in applied magnetic fields from 5 Oe to 50 kOe. Electrical resistivity was measured by a dc four-probe method at temperatures from 10 to 300 K. Electrical contacts were established by attaching gold wires (50 \mum) onto the _ab_ plane using silver paint with subsequent annealing in an argon atmosphere at 350 ^{\circ}C for 4 h.

## III Results and Discussion

### Properties of Sm_{1.88-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta}

Through the refinement of the x-ray diffraction data, it was confirmed that all the crystals of Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} (\delta = 0.03-0.04) have a tetragonal T^{*}-phase structure of space group I4/_mmm_. The refined lattice constants [Fig. 1(a)] and interatomic distances [Fig. 1(b)] of Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} are shown in Fig. 1 as a function of the Gd content x. For specimens with Gd contents of 0 \leq x \leq 1.0, the constants a and c decrease linearly as the Gd content increases. However, they change their behavior above x = 1. The nearest interatomic distances of Cu-R and Cu-Cu show the same Gd-content dependence as those of the lattice constants. This suggests that the crystal lattice of Sm_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} shrinks uniformly by the Gd substitution. The decrease in the lattice parameters appears to be due to the difference in the size of rare-earth ions. Since the ionic radius (0.111 nm) of Gd^{3+} is smaller than that (0.113 nm) of Sm^{3+}, the lattice parameters would decrease as the Gd content increases following Vegard's law. However, the behavior above x = 1 deviates from the law, suggesting that a change occurs in the crystal lattice.

Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of magnetization measured for Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} (x \leq 1) crystals under a magnetic field of 5 Oe applied to the _ab_ plane. (b) Temperature dependence of magnetization measured for Sm_{1.35}Gd_{0.3}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} crystal under a magnetic field of 10 kOe applied to the c axis and _ab_ plane. The inset of the figure shows the data for specimens with 0 \leq x \leq 1.2 at temperatures below 8 K.

  tetragonal crystals. A peak, which resembles the antiferromagnetic transition, is observed when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the c axis. In neutron diffraction studies for Sm_{2}CuO_{4}, it was reported that a long-range antiferromagnetic order of Sm spins was observed in the direction parallel to the c axis at about 6 K. [10, 20] In general, an antiferromagnetic peak appears in the geometry in which antiferromagnetically coupled moments are parallel to the applied magnetic field. Therefore, if the observed magnetization is due to rare-earth moments, the antiferromagnetic order of rare-earth ions must be parallel to the c axis for crystals with high Sm concentration. This is consistent with the result of neutron diffraction studies. The inset of Fig. 2(b) shows the temperature dependence of magnetization measured for specimens with various Gd contents at 10 kOe. The peak (hereafter the peak temperature is referred to as T_{\rm NR}), which is observed for specimens with a Gd content of 0 <= x <= 1, shifts to lower temperatures as the Gd content increases and cannot be observed for specimens with x > 1 at temperatures down to 2 K. This decrease in T_{\rm NR} seems to be due to the preferential direction of rare-earth spins. It is accepted that Sm spins are parallel to the c axis in Sm_{2}CuO_{4}, while Gd spins are parallel to the ab plane in Gd_{2}CuO_{4}. [10, 15] Since Gd spins are perpendicular to Sm spins in the Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} system, the magnetic interaction between Sm and Gd spins must be weaker than that among Sm spins. Therefore, Gd substitution will dilute the magnetic interaction among Sm spins, and T_{\rm NR} due to the Sm spins will then decrease with increasing the content of Gd.

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of magnetization measured for specimens of Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} (_x_ >= 1) under a magnetic field of 5 Oe applied parallel to the ab plane. New magnetic transitions appear in the temperature ranges of 2-10 K and 130-170 K. The magnetization observed for specimens with a Gd content of x > 1 at temperatures between 10 and 170 K is considerably larger than that expected for Cu ions and behaves like a ferromagnet. The transition observed at higher temperatures (130-170 K) is considered to be an antiferromagnetic (or weak-ferromagnetic) transition in the Cu sublattice, which has been observed in the neutron diffraction studies for R_{2}CuO_{4} (_R_ = Nd, Pr, or Sm) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] This transition (hereafter referred to as T_{\rm NCa}) shifts to higher temperatures with increasing the content of Gd. This behavior is consistent with that observed for Sm_{2-x}Gd_{x}CuO_{4-\delta} (Ref. [21]) and seems to be due to the change in the crystal structure, which has been shown in Fig. 1. Since the lattice constants and Cu-Cu distance decrease with increasing content of Gd, T_{\rm NCa} would increase by enhancement of the magnetic interaction between Cu spins. The transitions at temperatures between 6 and 20 K (hereafter the peak temperature is referred to as T_{\rm SR}) shift to higher temperatures as the Gd content increases. The shape of the thermomagnetic curve depends strongly on the Gd content and the intensity of the applied magnetic field. The behavior of magnetization, which is observed for specimens with a Gd content of x > 1 at temperatures between T_{\rm SR} and T_{\rm NCa}, is considered to be due to the weak ferromagnetism in the Cu sublattice. In general, weak ferromagnetism does not occur in magnetic oxides with high crystal symmetry. However, the lattice constants of Sm_{2-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta} change their behavior at about x = 1. This change in the lattice constants seems to have a close relation to the behavior of magnetization. If the crystal lattice starts to distort at about x = 1, weak ferromagnetism may occur through the deterioration of the crystal symmetry. In addition, x = 1 is the critical composition at which Gd ions take over the main role from Sm ions. As mentioned above, in the R_{2}CuO_{4}-type oxides, Sm and Gd spins have an antiferromagnetic order in the directions parallel to the c axis and ab plane, respectively, below Neel temperature. Therefore, although rare-earth spins are paramagnetic at temperatures above T_{\rm NR}, it is likely that Gd spins still remain in the ab plane and affect the weak ferromagnetism through a magnetic interaction between Cu and Gd spins. The decrease in the Cu-R distance, which has been shown in Fig. 1, may enhance the magnetic interaction between the Cu and Gd spins and the weak ferromagnetism. When the Gd content exceeds x = 1.5, another transition appears at temperatures of 2-5 K. This peak (hereafter the peak temperature is referred to as T_{\rm NCa}) appears to be an antiferromagnetic transition in the Gd sublattice. In the magnetic susceptibility, neutron diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and specific heat measurements for Gd_{2}CuO_{4}, a peak due to antiferromagnetic transition in the Gd sublattice has been reported at temperatures between 6 and 9 K when the magnetic field was applied parallel to the CuO_{2} plane (or ab plane). [12, 15, 16, 22, 23, 24] Therefore, it is considered that, in the Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} system, the antiferromagnetic order of Sm spins, which is parallel to the c axis, is suppressed by the Gd substitution and a new antiferromagnetic order due to Gd spins appears in the ab plane as the Gd content increases over x = 1. Details of these transitions at T_{\rm SR} and T_{\rm NGd} will be given in the next section.

  stant, respectively. \Theta = - 4.17 K and C = 0.085 were obtained by fitting the above equation to the data. The fitting was also done for specimens with various Gd contents. Figure 4(b) shows the asymptotic Curie temperature \Theta and the effective paramagnetic moment P_{\rm eff}, which is deduced from the Curie constant C, as a function of Gd content x. Here \Theta is always negative, and its absolute value increases as the Gd content increases. This result suggests that the antiferromagnetic interaction among rare-earth ions is enhanced by the Gd substitution. Since the magnetic moment of the Gd ion is lager than that of the Sm ion, the exchange interaction between rare-earth ions must be enhanced. On the other hand, P_{\rm eff} is considerably large and increases as the Gd content increases. It is well known that the magnetic moment of the Cu ion is very small in R_{2}CuO_{4}-type oxides. Therefore, the P_{\rm eff} observed for Sm_{2-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta} can be attributed to the magnetic moment of rare-earth ions. The values of P_{\rm eff} agree well with those calculated by assuming the theoretical magnetic moments of 0.84\mu_{B} and 7.94\mu_{B} for Sm^{3+} and Gd^{3+}, respectively.

### Properties of Gd_{2-y}Ce_{y}CuO_{4-\delta}

Figure 5(a) shows the Ce-content dependence of tetragonal lattice parameters a and c for specimens of Gd_{2-y}Ce_{y}CuO_{4-\delta}. Data for single crystals with a Ce content of y\leq0.15 are shown, together with those for polycrystals with a nominal Ce content of y>0.15. The lattice parameters a and c are almost constant for specimens with a Ce content of y> 0.15. This is consistent with the result of Ref. 19. Figure 5(b) shows the Ce content dependence of the antiferromagnetic transition temperature T_{\rm NCu} and the spin-reorientation temperature T_{\rm SR}, which were determined from the thermomagnetic curves measured under a magnetic field of 10 Oe. T_{\rm NCu} and T_{\rm SR} decrease to lower temperatures with increasing the content of Ce, however, they approach a fixed value in specimens with a Ce content of y> 0.15. These behaviors are very similar to that of the lattice constant c and suggest that the solubility limit of Ce is found in the vicinity of y = 0.15. It is well known that the Ce ion exists as a nonmagnetic Ce^{4+} ion in the superconducting R_{2-y}Ce_{y}CuO_{4-\delta} (R = Pr, Nd, and Sm). Therefore, it seems natural to consider that the Ce ion exists as a Ce^{4+} ion in Gd_{2-y}Ce_{y}CuO_{4-\delta}. Since the oxygen deficiency has been kept in the range of 0.03-0.04, the valence state of Cu ions must be changed by the substitution of Ce^{4+} ions, and then the nonmagnetic Cu^{+} ion will be introduced. The decrease observed for T_{\rm NCu}(y) and T_{\rm SR}(y) would be due to the valence change of Cu ions.

Figure 6 shows the temperature dependence of the magnetization measured for Gd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta}, which is the end member of the Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} system, under a magnetic field of 10 Oe applied parallel to the c axis and ab plane. The magnetization observed in the c axis is very small and shows a monotonous decrease with increasing the temperature. However, when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the ab plane, distinct magnetic transitions are observed at 4, 10, and 160 K, and as shown in the inset of the figure, the transitions at 4 and 10 K show a thermal hysteresis during the heating and cooling processes. These transitions are hereafter referred to as transitions A, B

  and C, and the phases between these transitions are referred to as phases I, II, III, and IV. Transition A, which has been observed for specimens of Sm1,85-_x_Gd,Ce0.15CuO4-_d_ (_x_  1.6) and characterized by _T_NGd, is an antiferromagnetic transition occurring in the Gd sublattice. On the other hand, transitions B and C, respectively, correspond to the spin-reorientation and the antiferromagnetic transitions, which have been characterized by _T_SR and _T_NCu in the results of the magnetization measurement for Sm1,85-_x_Gd,Ce0.15CuO4-_d_.

Following the theoretical studies of the magnetism of orthorhombic and orthoferrite systems,25 the Hamiltonian of the (Gd,Ce)2CuO4 system is given by \mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}_{\text{Cu}} + \mathcal{H}_{\text{Ca-Gd}} + \mathcal{H}_{\text{Gd}}, where \mathcal{H}_{\text{Ca}}, \mathcal{H}_{\text{Gd}}, and \mathcal{H}_{\text{Ca-Gd}} are the Hamiltonians of Cu and Gd ions and the interaction between Cu and Gd ions, respectively. The Hamiltonian \mathcal{H}_{\text{Cu}} is given by \mathcal{H}_{\text{Cu}} = \mathcal{H}_{\text{iso}} + \mathcal{H}_{\text{anti}} + \mathcal{H}_{\text{symm}} + \mathcal{H}_{\text{am}}, where \mathcal{H}_{\text{iso}}, \mathcal{H}_{\text{am}}i, and \mathcal{H}_{\text{symm}} are the Hamiltonians of the isotropic exchange interaction \Sigma_{i\neq j}\mathcal{H}_{j}\mathbf{S}_{i}^{\text{Ca}}\mathbf{S}_{j}^{\text{Ca}}, the antisymmetric exchange interaction \Sigma_{i\neq j}\mathcal{H}_{j}\mathbf{S}_{i}^{\text{Ca}}\mathbf{\times} \mathbf{S}_{i}^{\text{Ca}}, and the anisotropic-symmetric exchange interactions \Sigma_{i\neq j}\mathbf{S}_{i}^{\text{Ca}}\mathbf{\cdot}\mathbf{\cdot}\mathbf{S}_{j}^{\text{Ca}} between Cu ions, respectively, and \mathcal{H}_{\text{am}} is the one-ion anisotropy energy DS_{z}^{2} + E(S_{x}^{2} - S_{y}^{2}) of Cu ions. Therefore, the Hamiltonian \mathcal{H}_{\text{Cu}} is further given by

\[\mathcal{H}_{\text{Cu}} = \sum_{i\neq j}\,\left(J_{ij}\mathbf{S}_{i}^{\text{Cu}}\mathbf{S}_{j}^{\text{Cu}}\mathbf{+}\mathbf{D}_{ij}\cdot\mathbf{S}_{i}^{\text{Cu}}\mathbf{\times}\mathbf{S}_{j}^{\text{Cu}}\mathbf{+}\mathbf{S}_{i}^{\text{Cu}}\mathbf{\cdot}\mathbf{a}_{ij}\cdot\mathbf{S}_{j}^{\text{Cu}}\right)\] \[+ DS_{z}^{2} + E(S_{x}^{2} - S_{y}^{2}).\]

At temperatures between _T_NCu and _T_SR, the easy axis of magnetization of Cu spins is determined by the one-ion magnetic anisotropy of Cu ions, the Cu spins are aligned antiferromagnetically along the [110] direction by the isotropic exchange interaction, and a weak-ferromagnetic moment is induced by the antisymmetric exchange interaction (or Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction [26]), which tilts Cu spins toward the [001] direction (overt canting) and spreads them out along the _ab_ plane (hidden canting). However, x-ray diffraction studies have revealed that Gd1,85Ce0.15CuO4 has a tetragonal structure of space group I4/_mmm_, and weak ferromagnetism due to the antisymmetric exchange interaction cannot be expected for crystals with a high symmetry such as I4/_mmm_. Although the existence and the effect of local distortion have been proposed to explain the occurrence of weak ferromagnetism in Gd2CuO4 and related oxides, [12, 16, 27, 28, 29] the details of the distortion and magnetism in Gd1,85Ce0.15CuO4 still remained unclear. Figure 7 shows the electron diffraction pattern for the (001) plane (or the _ab_ plane) of a Gd1,85Ce0.15CuO4 crystal. Small extra spots are observed among clear main spots. This is strong evidence of a lattice distortion existing in Gd1,85Ce0.15CuO4 crystals. The diffraction pattern can be explained by assuming the orthorhombic space group _Bmab_. A small distortion of the oxygen site in the _ab_ plane is considered to deteriorate the crystal symmetry. The orthorhombic lattice parameter _a*_ (or _b*_) of space group _Bmab_ has a relation of _a*_ =_b_2a with tetragonal lattice parameter a of space group I4/_mmm_. Possible lattice distortion models that explain the electron diffraction pattern with orthorhombic symmetry are shown in Fig. 7. Each model has an alternative lattice distortion in the CuO2 plane; however, the position of Cu ions is independent of the lattice distortion. Among these models, (b) most likely exists in Gd1,85Ce0.15CuO4 crystals. When the middle point (point _M_) of a line between Cu ions is the center of inversion symmetry, **D** is equal to zero. This is the case for tetragonal crystals of space group I4/_mmm_. Since the point M is a center of inversion symmetry, weak ferromagnetism due to the antisymmetric exchange interaction cannot be expected. However, when a lattice distortion occurs in a tetragonal crystal and the crystal has an orthorhombic structure of space group _Bmab_, weak ferromagnetism may occur in Gd1,85Ce0.15CuO4 since point M is no longer a center of inversion symmetry. Therefore, the magnetism observed at temperatures between _T_SR and _T_NCu (phase III) is considered to be weak ferromagnetism.

Figure 8(a) shows the temperature dependence of magnetization measured for the same crystal under various magnetic fields applied parallel to the c axis. In this case, al

  though a small anomaly is observed at about 10 K, magnetization shows a monotonous decrease as the temperature is increased. Figure 8(b) shows the temperature dependence of magnetization measured under various magnetic fields applied parallel to the _ab_ plane. Transitions observed at low temperatures are affected considerably by the applied magnetic field. When the field intensity is increased, transition B (at _T_SR), at which the antiferromagnetic spin configuration in the Cu sublattice is reoriented to form a weak-ferromagnetic order, shifts to lower temperatures and coincides with transition A (at _T_NGd) at an applied field of \sim2 kOe to form a single peak near 6 K. When a magnetic field over 3 kOe is applied, the peak becomes indistinct; furthermore, magnetization increases monotonously with descending the temperature, and a shoulder is observed near 6 K. A magnetic phase diagram for a specimen of Gd1.85Ce0.15CuO4 at low temperature is shown in Fig. 8(c). In the phase between _T_SR and _T_NGd, Cu and Gd spins are considered to exist in an antiferromagnetic and a paramagnetic state, respectively. This phase disappears at a magnetic field above 2 kOe. This seems to be due to a field-induced spin reorientation of Cu spins. When the field intensity increases, the antiferromagnetically ordered Cu spins, which are very sensitive to the applied magnetic field, reorient to form a weak-ferromagnetic spin configuration, which is the same magnetic structure as that in phase III. The decrease in _T_SR(_H_) is attributed to the expansion of the weak-ferromagnetic phase (phase III) to lower temperatures with the assistance of the applied magnetic field. On the other hand, paramagnetic Gd spins in phase II are aligned by an internal magnetic field, which is induced by the formation of a weak-ferromagnetic spin configuration in the Cu sublattice through field-induced spin reorientation, and make a great contribution to the magnetization. This is why magnetization in phase II increases as the applied field increases.

The magnetization observed in the _ab_ plane at temperatures between _T_SR and _T_NCu is considerably larger than that expected for Cu ions. The magnetization is attributed to the moment of Gd ions. Figures 9(a) and 9(b) show the temperature dependence of reciprocal magnetic susceptibility \chi^{-1} measured in various magnetic fields applied parallel to the _ab_ plane and c axis, respectively. The \chi^{-1}(T) shows linear temperature dependence at temperatures between 10 and 150 K, and the linear part of the curve can be fitted by the Curie-Weiss law. Figure 9(c) shows the field dependence of effective magnetic moment _P_eff, which is calculated from the Curie constant obtained by the fitting. _P_eff decreases considerably at a low magnetic field and approaches the constant value (\sim 7.9\mu_{B}) at higher magnetic fields. This value is consistent with the theoretical value (7.94\mu_{B}) for the free Gd ion. From the results shown in Figs. 8 and 9, it is supposed that, in phase III, the paramagnetic moments of Gd ions are aligned by an internal magnetic field induced by a spontaneous magnetization of Gd ions. The magnetic moment of Gd ions is \sim 1.5 kOe, \sim 1.5 kOe, and \sim 1.5 kOe. The magnetic moment of Gd ions is \sim 1.

  ous weak-ferromagnetic (WF) moment that is brought on by a canting of antiferromagnetically coupled moments of Cu ions. Taking the theoretical considerations by Yamaguchi for _RM_O3 (_R_ = rare earth, M = Fe or Cr) into account, the Hamiltonian of the interaction between Cu and Gd ions in the (Gd,Ce)2CuO4 system would be represented by

\[{\cal H}_{\rm Cu-Gd} = {\sum\limits_{i \neq j}}\ ({\bar{J}}_{ij}{\bf S}_{i}^{\rm Cu} \cdot {\bf S}_{j}^{\rm Gd} + {\bf{\bar{D}}}_{ij} \cdot {\bf S}_{i}^{\rm Cu} \times {\bf S}_{i}^{\rm Gd} + {\bf S}_{i}^{\rm Cu} \cdot {\bf{\bar{a}}}_{ij} \cdot {\bf S}_{j}^{\rm Gd} )\]

using the isotropic, the antisymmetric, and the anisotropo-symmetric exchange interactions between Cu and Gd ions.[25] Gd spins are aligned antiparallel to the weak-ferromagnetic moment through the interaction {\Sigma}_{i \neq j}{\bar{J}}_{ij}{\bf S}_{i}^{\rm Cu} \cdot {\bf S}_{j}^{\rm Gd}. This interaction can be represented in terms of an interaction between an effective magnetic field H_{i} and the spin moment of the Gd ion, which is given by E = - \alpha M_{\rm Cu}M_{\rm Gd} = - H_{i}M_{\rm Gd}. This effective field corresponds to the internal field mentioned above. When the spin moment of the rare-earth ion increases as the temperature is lowered, the isotropic exchange interaction {\Sigma}_{i \neq j}{\bar{J}}_{ij}{\bf S}_{i}^{\rm Cu} \cdot {\bf S}_{j}^{R} is enhanced, and then the effective magnetic field H_{i} is increased. The magnitude of the WF moment as well as the canting angle depends on the intensity of the applied magnetic field. When the WF moment is enhanced by the applied magnetic field and Gd moments are aligned completely in the direction of internal magnetic field, the effective moment _P_eff becomes constant. This must be why large magnetization is observed in the _ab_ plane at temperatures between _T_SR and _T_NCu, the magnetization depending strongly on the Gd content and the intensity of the applied magnetic field.

In order to describe the magnetism of Gd1.85Ce0.15CuO4 in detail, the field dependence of magnetization was measured at some characteristic temperatures in phases I, II, III, and IV. Figure 10(a) shows the field dependence of magnetization measured for Gd1.85Ce0.15CuO4 at 200 K in phase IV by applying a magnetic field parallel to the _ab_ plane. The _M_(_H_) curve shows linear and reversible field dependence, suggesting the existence of paramagnetism at temperatures above _T_NCu (or transition _C_). This behavior is independent of the field direction. Figure 10(b) shows magnetization curves _M_(_H_) measured at various temperatures in phase III under a magnetic field applied parallel to the [100] direction in the _ab_ plane (hereafter direction is represented by the tetragonal symmetry of space group _I4/mmm_). The magnetization tends to be saturated at a very low magnetic field (_H_ < 200 Oe) and shows linear field dependence at higher magnetic fields. In addition, a magnetic hysteresis was observed in the _M_(_H_) curves. The _M_(_H_) curves in the [110] direction show the same behavior as those in the [100] direction. This behavior of the _M_(_H_) curves resembles that of weak ferromagnetism. When weak ferromagnetism is established in Gd1.85Ce0.15CuO4, the _M_(_H_) curve is represented by

\[M(H) = M_{\rm Cu} + C_{\rm Gd}\frac{H_{i} + H}{T + \Theta},\]

where _M_Cu, _C_Gd, H_{i}, and _Th_ are the spontaneous weak-ferromagnetic moment induced by a canting of Cu spins, the Curie constant of Gd, the internal field acting on Gd sites, and the asymptotic Curie temperature, respectively.[30]_C_Cu has been ignored because _C_Gd appears to be much larger than _C_Cu. H_{i} and _M_Cu can be determined from the _M_(_H_) curves measured at different temperatures between 20 and 130 K using Eq. (1). The extrapolation of the linear portion of _M_(_H_) curves, which are measured at neighboring temperatures, intersects at a point, indicating H = H_{i} and M = _M_Cu. Here H_{i} = - 426 Oe and _M_Cu = (4.2x10-3)_m_B were obtained from the _M_(_H_) curves measured at 20 and 50 K. The negative sign of H_{i} indicates that the internal field acting on the Gd site is antiparallel to the direction of the applied magnetic field. These values are consistent with those reported for Gd2CuO4.[19,23,31,32] Since paramagnetic Gd moments are aligned by H_{i}, significantly large magnetization can be observed even in a low applied magnetic field of 10 Oe. Here H_{i} at each temperature can be estimated by neglecting the _M_Cu in Eq. (1). In this case, a point where the linear extrapolation of the _M_(_H_) curve intersects the abscissa gives H_{i}. The absolute value of H_{i} is shown in Fig. 11(a) as a function of the temperature. H_{i} shows a remarkable decrease in the vicinity of _T_NCu. Moreover, it is seen that H_{i} along the c axis is about one-tenth of that in the _ab_ plane. These facts apparently indicate that the WF moment, which is due to a canting of Cu moments, exists in the _ab_ plane at temperatures between _T_SR and _T_NCu. Figure 11(b) shows the Gd-content dependence of H_{i} obtained for specimens of Sm1.85-xGd,Ce0.15CuO4-_g_ at 50 K by applying a magnetic field parallel to the [100] direction. H_{i} appears for specimens with a Gd content of x > 1, while the superconductivity disappears for these specimens. Although the occurrence of weak ferromagnetism is attributed to the lattice distortion

Figure 10: (a) Field dependence of magnetization measured for Gd1.85Ce0.15CuO4−_δ_ crystal at 200 K by applying a magnetic field parallel to the _ab_ plane and (b) field dependence of magnetization measured at various temperatures in phase III under a magnetic field applied parallel to the [100] direction in the _ab_ plane.

  that is caused by the Gd substitution, the role of the magnetic interaction between Cu and Gd cannot be disregarded. Unlike Sm spins, which are parallel to the c axis and perpendicular to the Cu spins, Gd spins seem to exist in the ab plane, at which weak-ferromagnetic Cu spins exist; thus, the magnetic interaction between Cu and Gd spins is expected to be much stronger than that between Cu and Sm spins. Therefore, the magnetic interaction between Cu and Gd may contribute to the occurrence of weak ferromagnetism and the suppression of superconductivity observed for specimens of Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} (x< 1).

Figure 12 shows the angular dependence of magnetization measured for Gd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4} at 3, 6, and 20 K, respectively, in phases I, II, and III under a magnetic field of 20 Oe applied parallel to the ab plane.

Here \theta is an angle from the [100] direction. Magnetization shows anisotropic behavior at 3 and 20 K, and the maximum and minimum are observed at angles that correspond to the \langle 110\rangle and \langle 100\rangle directions, respectively. However, the difference between the maximum and minimum is much smaller at 3 K than at 20 K. On the other hand, there is little angular dependence at 6 K. The M(\theta) curve at 20 K can be explained qualitatively assuming a single magnetic domain. In the domain, antiferromagnetically coupled Cu spins align parallel to one of the \langle 110\rangle directions, and a slight canting of the spins from the \langle 110\rangle direction induces a spontaneous WF moment in the direction perpendicular to the Cu spins. Paramagnetic Gd spins are aligned in the direction of internal magnetic field H_{i}, which is induced by the WF moment. Since the magnetic moment of Cu ions is negligibly smaller than that of Gd ions, magnetization due to Gd spins, which are aligned by H_{i}, can be observed in the magnetization measurement. When the applied magnetic field is rotated from the [110] direction and goes across the [010] direction, the spontaneous WF moment lying in the [110] direction switches to the [\,\overline{1} 10] direction, which is the nearest direction to the applied field. Since the switching occurs under an applied field that is much smaller than the internal magnetic field H_{i}, a maximum and minimum of magnetization must be observed when the magnetic field of 20 Oe is applied parallel to the \langle 110\rangle and \langle 100\rangle directions, respectively.

Figure 13(a) shows the field dependence of magnetization measured for Gd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} crystal at 6 K (in phase II) by applying a magnetic field to the [001] (c-axis) direction and [100] and [\,\overline{1} 10] directions in the ab plane.

The inset of the figure shows the high-field susceptibility measured in the [100] direction of Gd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4} crystal at various temperatures in phase III (open circle) and 6 K (solid circle).

  ing a magnetic field to the [001] (=_c_ axis), [100], and [\bar{1}10] directions in the _ab_ plane. The _M_(_H_) curve in the [001] direction shows a linear field dependence, while those in the [100] and [\bar{1}10] directions change their slope at _H__c_1 = 0.5 kOe and _H__c_2 = 1.8 kOe. This seems to be a field-induced magnetic phase transition that begins near 0.5 kOe and finishes at about 1.8 kOe. The magnetic susceptibility measured in the [100] (or [\bar{1}10]) direction above and below 1.8 kOe is _x_high = 9.66x10-3 emu/cm3 and _x_low = 11.48 x 10-3 emu/cm3, respectively. The inset of the figure shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility measured in the [100] direction at temperatures in phase III. It is seen that the _x_high at 6 K agrees well with the extrapolation of the _kh_(_T_) curve measured above 10 K. Therefore, it is likely that the antiferromagnetic configuration of Cu spins in phase II, changes into the same canted spin arrangement as that in phase III at magnetic fields between _H__c_1 and _H__c_2. On the other hand, Gd spins appear to be paramagnetic in phase II at magnetic fields below _H__c_1. This is clear from the result shown in Fig. 12, in which no angular dependence is observed at 6 K under a field of 20 Oe. However, when the canted spin configuration of Cu ions is established at magnetic fields above _H__c_2, paramagnetic Gd spins align in the direction of H_{i}, which is induced by the WF moment, and contribute to the magnetization of the specimen. Figure 13(b) shows the Gd-content dependence of the critical field _H__c_2 obtained for specimens of Sm1.85-xGdACe0.13CuO4-_d_ at 6 K. Here _H__c_2 increases monotonously above _x_> 1, suggesting that the antiferromagnetic configuration of Cu spins in phase II becomes more stable to the applied field by the Gd substitution. The magnetic interaction between Cu and Gd spins seems to stabilize the antiferromagnetic spin configuration of Cu ions and suppress the field-induced spin-reorientation transition from an antiferromagnetic to a weak-ferromagnetic state.

Figure 14 shows the field dependence of magnetization measured for Gd1.85Ce0.15CuO4 at 3 K in phase I by applying a magnetic field to the [100], [\bar{1}10], and [001] directions. The magnetization in the [100] and [\bar{1}10] directions rises remarkably as the applied field increases and tends to be saturated at about 200 Oe. However, the magnetization shows a linear field dependence with a further increase in the magnetic field, and jumps are observed at 1.8 and 2.7 kOe, respectively, in the [\bar{1}10] and [100] directions. Moreover, the _M_(_H_) curve changes its slope before and after the jumps. On the other hand, the _M_(_H_) curve in the [001] direction shows linear field dependence up to 50 kOe. The behavior of the _M_(_H_) curves is explained qualitatively by a model in which Cu, spins align antiferromagnetically in the axis parallel to the [110] direction, inducing a spontaneous WF moment in the [\bar{1}10] direction, while Gd spins align antiferromagnetically in the axis parallel to the [\bar{1}10] direction. The weak-ferromagnetic spin configuration in the Cu sublattice is the same as that of phase III. In this case, the field dependence of magnetization is given by

\[M(H) = M_{\text{Cu}} + (\chi_{\text{Cu}} + \chi_{\text{Gd}})H,\]

where _M_Cu, _X_Cu, and _X_Gd are the spontaneous WF moment due to Cu spins and the antiferromagnetic susceptibility of Cu and Gd sublattices, respectively. The initial increase in the _M_(_H_) curve is attributed to the _M_Cu, and a single-domain structure is attained in this process. When a magnetic field H with an intensity below 1.8 kOe is applied to the [\bar{1}10] direction, a WF moment due to canting Cu spins aligns in the [\bar{1}10] direction. On the other hand, antiferromagnetic Gd spins align in the axis parallel to the [\bar{1}10] direction with a slight tilting of an antiferromagnetic component, which is antiparallel to the applied field, from [1\bar{1}0] towards the direction of the applied field H. In this case, (_X_Cu + \chi_{\text{Gd}}) must be used instead of (_X_Cu + \chi_{\text{Gd}}) in Eq. (2). Since _X_Cu seems to be larger than _X_Gd, the contribution of _X_Cu would be dominant in this field range. The magnetization jump observed in the [\bar{1}10] direction at 1.8 kOe is considered to be a flop of antiferromagnetic Gd spins from a parallel to a perpendicular spin arrangement regarding the direction of the applied field. In this case, the critical field H_{c} for spin flopping of antiferromagnetically coupled Gd spins is given by

\[H_{c} = \sqrt{\frac{2K}{\chi_{\text{Gd}\bot} - \chi_{\text{Gd}\|}}},\]

where K is the anisotropy constant and _kh_Gd,1 and _X_Gd are perpendicular and parallel magnetic susceptibilities, respectively. In the geometry in which a magnetic field is applied to the [\bar{1}10] direction, the field-dependent term in Eq. (2) is given by (_X_Cu + \chi_{\text{Gd}\bot})_H_ at magnetic fields above 1.8 kOe. Therefore, since (_X_Gd - \chi_{\text{Gd}\|}) is obtained by subtracting (_X_Cu + \chi_{\text{Gd}\|}) from (_X_Cu + \chi_{\text{Gd}\bot}), the anisotropy constant K can be estimated using Eq. (3). Here K = 6.05 x103 erg/cm3 was obtained by using H_{c} = 1.8 kOe, (_kh_Cu + \chi_{\text{Gd}\|} = 6.49\times 10^{- 3} emu/cm3, and (_X_Cu + \chi_{\text{Gd}\|} = 1.02\times 10^{3} emu/cm3. On the other hand, a magnetization jump is observed at 2.7 kOe when a magnetic field is applied to the [100] direction. In this geometry, the field component in the [\bar{1}10] direction causes the spin flopping, and the component is given by H110=_H_ cos _th_, where _th_ is the angle between H and the [\bar{1}10] direction. When _th_ = _p_/4 rad and H = 2.7 kOe

  were used, H_{110}=1.9 kOe was deduced. This value is consistent with the critical field H_{c} (=1.8 kOe) for the spin flopping observed in the [\,\overline{1}\,10] direction. Moreover, this model is consistent with the angular dependence observed in the M\left(\theta\right) at 3 K (Fig. 12). Since the ground state of Gd^{3+} is ^{8}S_{7/22} and, consequently, large one-ion magnetic anisotropy cannot be expected, the antiferromagnetic order in the Gd sublattice would be considerably affected by the applied magnetic field and the magnetism in the Cu sublattice.

The magnetic structure in Gd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4} crystals can be estimated by taking the crystal symmetry into account. When the four basis vectors of \mathbf{F}=\mathbf{S}_{1}+\mathbf{S}_{2}+\mathbf{S}_{3}+\mathbf{S}_{4}, \mathbf{G}=\mathbf{S}_{1}-\mathbf{S}_{2}+\mathbf{S}_{3}-\mathbf{S}_{4}, \mathbf{C}=\mathbf{S}_{1}+\mathbf{S}_{2}-\mathbf{S}_{3}-\mathbf{S}_{4}, and \mathbf{A}=\mathbf{S}_{1}-\mathbf{S}_{2}-\mathbf{S}_{3}+\mathbf{S}_{4} are considered for the Cu(4_a_) sites of _Bmab_, irreducible representations of these vectors are obtained following Bertaut's representation theory.[33] The irreducible representations of the basis vectors for Cu(4_a_) sites are shown in Table 1. Since the components of basis vectors in the same representation can be coupled, a canted spin structure is attained. In these representations, antiferromagnetically coupled sublattice moments must be parallel to the [110] direction in \Gamma_{1}, \Gamma_{3}, and \Gamma_{4} and parallel to the [001] direction in \Gamma_{2}, and a spontaneous WF moment can be observed along the [110], [\,\overline{1}\,10], and [001] directions in \Gamma_{2}, \Gamma_{3}, and \Gamma_{4}, respectively. According to the results of magnetic measurements mentioned above, Cu-sublattice moments are always parallel to the [110] direction regardless of the different magnetic phases, and a WF moment is parallel to the [\,\overline{1}\,10] direction in phases I and III. Therefore, among the representations, \Gamma_{3} is consistent with the magnetism in phases I and III, and \Gamma_{1} is consistent with the magnetism of phase II at a low magnetic field. Possible spin configurations in these magnetic phases are shown in Fig. 15. Antiferromagnetically coupled sublattice moments of Gd are parallel to the [\,\overline{1}\,10] direction at a low magnetic field at 3 K in phase I and paramagnetic at 6 and 20 K, respectively, in phase II and III. However, when a magnetic field with high intensity is applied to the [\,\overline{1}\,10] direction, the antiferromagnetic sublattice moments of Gd flop and become parallel to the [110] direction in phase I, and the spin configuration of Cu ions in phase II transforms from \Gamma_{1} to \Gamma_{3} through a field-induced spin-reorientation transition, inducing a spontaneous WF moment of Cu spins along the [\,\overline{1}\,10] direction. In the thermomagnetic curve shown in the inset of Fig. 6, a thermal hysteresis was observed at transitions A and B. Since the thermal hysteresis is a typical characteristic of the first-order phase transition, the phase transition between antiferromagnetic \Gamma_{1} and weak-ferromagnetic \Gamma_{3} phases appears to be a first-order phase transition. The isotropic exchange interaction between Cu and Gd ions is thought to play a key role in the spin reorientation at T_{\rm SR}. When the spin moment of the Gd ion increases at low temperature and then the isotropic exchange interaction \Sigma_{i+\mu}\vec{J}_{i}\vec{S}_{j}^{\rm Cu}\cdot\mathbf{S}_{j}^{\rm Gd} (or the interaction energy between Cu spins and H_{i}) is enhanced and exceeds the anisotropy energy of Cu ions at a specific temperature (=T_{\rm SR}), the Cu spins undergo a spontaneous spin reorientation similar to that observed in the orthoferrites and orthochromites. Since Gd^{3+} is an S-state ion, the anisotropy energy of the Gd ion gives little contribution to the spin reorientation. It is important to the occurrence of the spin reorientation that the exchange coefficients \vec{D} and \vec{a} be comparable to the anisotropy constant K. This type of spin reorientation was observed for DyFeO_{3}.[34] DyFeO_{3} shows a spin-reorientation transition from the low-temperature antiferromagnetic to the high-temperature weak-ferromagnetic spin configuration at about 30 K, and the magnetization shows a sharp increase. In the antiferromagnetic phase, no ferromagnetism is associated with the spin configuration of Fe^{3+} spins, and the spin moment of Dy^{3+} has therefore been considered to be paramagnetic. The abrupt (first-order) spin reorientation has been considered to be due to the isotropic interaction \Sigma_{i+\mu}\vec{J}_{i}\vec{S}_{j}^{\rm Fe}\cdot\mathbf{S}_{j}^{\rm Dy} between the Fe^{3+} and Dy^{3+} sublattices.[25]

## IV Conclusion

The magnetic properties of Sm_{1.85-x}Gd_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\beta} and Gd_{2-x}Ce_{y}CuO_{4-\delta} systems were investigated, and the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism was studied. All the transitions observed in the

  Sm1,85-_x_Gd,Ce0.15CuO4 system are summarized in Fig. 16 as a function of Gd content. A superconducting transition is observed for specimens with a Gd content of 0 <= x x <= 1.1. Sm spins have an antiferromagnetic order along the [001] direction below Neel temperature _T_NR (~5 K for x = 0), which is observed for specimens of x <= 1 at high field intensity. The _T_NR as well as the superconducting transition temperature _T_c decreases with increasing Gd content and disappears for specimens of x > 1.1. Successive magnetic transitions appear at about 3, 7, and 135 K as the Gd content increases over x = 1.1. Although Cu spins have an antiferromagnetic order along the [110] direction among these transitions, a weak-ferromagnetic moment which is due to a canting of the Cu spins appears along the [\begin{equation*}{\bar{\top}}10\end{equation*}] direction at temperatures of T <= 3 K (phase I) and 7 K <= T <= 135 K (phase III). The antiferromagnetic configuration of Cu spins at 3 K < T < 7 K (phase II) is affected by the external field and changes into a weak-ferromagnetic spin configuration, which is the same structure as that in phase III, via field-induced spin reorientation. The transition at 7 K is a temperature-induced spin-reorientation transition between antiferromagnetic (phase II) and weak-ferromagnetic (phase III) spin configurations in the Cu sublattice. The reorientation temperature _T_SR, which is observed at very low field intensity, shifts to higher temperatures with increasing x. On the other hand, the transition at 3 K is an antiferromagnetic transition in the Gd sublattice. The transition, which is characterized by Neel temperature _T_NGd and is observed for x > 1.5, shifts to higher temperatures with increasing Gd content. With the formation of an antiferromagnetic order in the Gd sublattice, Cu spins reorient from an antiferromagnetic (_T_ >= _T_NGd) to a weak-ferromagnetic (_T_ <= _T_NGd) configuration. Peaks at _T_NGd and _T_SR are sensitive to the magnetic field: they merge at about 2 kOe and disappear at a magnetic field of about 10 kOe.

The results of this study suggest that Gd substitution changes the magnetic structure of host material Sm1,85Ce0.15CuO4 and suppresses superconductivity. The suppression of the superconductivity is attributed to the geometry of rare-earth and Cu spins. In Sm1,85Ce0.15CuO4, antiferromagnetically coupled Sm spins are parallel to the [001] direction and perpendicular to the Cu spins, which couple antiferromagnetically in the _ab_ plane, while, in Gd1,85Ce0.15CuO4, both Gd and Cu spins are parallel to the _ab_ plane. Since the exchange interaction between rare-earth and Cu spins in the same plane must be stronger than that of a perpendicular spin configuration, the fluctuation of Cu spins must be suppressed by the interaction, and the superconductivity of Sm1,85Ce0.15CuO4 would thus be suppressed by the Gd substitution.
