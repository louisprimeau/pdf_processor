###### Abstract

We report the results of an experimental study of dc and low-frequency magnetic properties of a K0.8Fe2.5.Se2 single crystal when the dc magnetic field is applied parallel to the **ab** plane. From the data obtained, we deduce the full _H-T_ phase diagram, which consists of all three _H_c1(_T_), _H_c2(_T_), and _H_c3(_T_) critical magnetic-field plots. The two _H_c1(_T_) and _H_c2(_T_) curves were obtained from dc magnetic measurements, whereas the surface critical-field _H_c3(_T_) line was extracted by ac susceptibility studies. It appears that near _T_c, the _H_c3(_T_)/_H_c2(_T_) ratio is 4.4, which is much larger than expected.

pacs: 20110.1103/PhysRevB.84.052503 Over the past four decades, the ternary intermetallic compounds, which crystallize in the body-centered tetragonal ThCr2Si2 (space group _I4/mmm_), have been of great interest due to the variety of physical phenomena observed in these materials. As early as 1973, both magnetic and Mossbauer (MS) effect spectroscopy studies suggested that in _R_Fe2\(M\)2 (_R_ = rare earth; \(M\) = Si or Ge), the Fe ions are diamagnetic.\({}^{1}\) Indeed, neutron powder diffraction measurements on NdFe2Si2 confirmed the absence of any magnetic moment on the Fe sites, and determined that the Nd sublattice is antiferromagnetically (AFM) ordered at _T_N  16 K, with the moments aligned along the **c** axis.\({}^{2}\)

At high temperatures, both BaFe2As2 and _M_Fe2Se2 (_M_ = K, Rb, Cs, Tl/K, and Tl/Rb) pristine materials also crystallize in this tetragonal ThCr2Si2 type structure. The common properties of these systems are that the Fe-As and Fe-Se layers exhibit long-range three-dimensional AFM order at _T_N  140-150 and 520-550 K, with Fe2+ moments of 0.87(3) _m_B/Fe or 3.3 _m_B/Fe, respectively. In BaFe2As2, the Fe moments are aligned within the **ab** plane,\({}^{3}\) whereas in _M_Fe2Se2 they are along the **c** axis.\({}^{4}\) Also associated with or preceding the magnetic transition is a structural transition: tetragonal to orthorhombic for the pnictides, and tetragonal (_I4/mmm_) to another tetragonal (_I4/m_) structure for the Fe-Se based materials. The major difference between the two systems, noticeable from several types of measurements, is that in the Fe-As based materials the temperature composition complex phase diagrams show a generic behavior as a function of the substituent concentration (_x_). This implies a systematic suppression of the magnetic transition by increasing \(x\) by either electrons or holes.\({}^{5}\) Then, above a critical concentration (which depends on the substituent), superconductivity is observed. Indeed, partial substitution of Ni or Co for Fe in BaFe2As2 induces superconductivity (SC) in the Ba(Fe1-Ni)2As2 and Ba(Fe1-x Co3)2As2 systems.\({}^{5,6}\) On the other hand, the nonstoichiometric _M_xFe2-x,Se2 materials also become superconductive around 30-33 K, but the AFM state persists even at low temperatures. That means that in _M_xFe2-x Se2 a real coexistence of the two states occurs, since both states are confined to the same Fe-Se crystallographic layer.\({}^{7}\) This peculiar property marks such a system as a very unique one and opens a new avenue for the study of the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity.

So far, the bulk upper critical magnetic field (_H_c2) for SC _M_xFe2-x Se2 single crystals has been determined over a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields. For K0.8Fe1.76Se2, the field dependence of the resistivity at low dc fields (_H_0) and the radio frequency penetration depth in a pulsed magnet up to 60 T exhibit an anisotropy in _H_c2 when measured along or perpendicular to the **c** axis.\({}^{8}\) Generally speaking, a linear temperature dependence of _H_c2 in both directions is observed and the slope close to _T_c is higher for \(H\)0 parallel to the **ab** plane. The initial anisotropy factor \(g\) is 82.\({}^{8}\) Similar results were obtained for Tl0.58 Rb0.42Fe1.72Se2, where the extrapolation to \(T\) = 0 yields _H_c2(0) 221 and 44.2 T (an anisotropy \(g\)  5) for \(H\)0 parallel or perpendicular to the **ab** plane, respectively.\({}^{9,10}\)

In this work, we report on the temperature dependence of the three critical fields _H_c1, _H_c2, and _H_c3 in a K0.8Fe2-y,Se2 (y = 0.25) single crystal (_T_c  31 K) measured in a magnetic field applied parallel to the **ab** plane. Both _H_c1(_T_) and _H_c2(_T_) plots were deduced from dc _M_(_H_0) and _M_(_T_) curves. In addition, the _M_(_H_0) curve at 35 K (above _T_c) is not linear as expected for an AFM material, but rather exhibits a small peculiar hysteresis loop, which is shifted from the origin, known as the exchange biased field phenomenon. These observations are compared with earlier reports on similar materials. A _H_c3(_T_) plot was obtained by ac susceptibility measurements. It appears that, near _T_c, _H_c3/_H_c2  4.4, a value that is much higher than the 1.7 predicted for conventional SC material.\({}^{11}\)

A single crystal with the nominal composition of K0.73Fe1.68Se2 single crystal was grown in Hefei by the conventional high-temperature flux method.\({}^{7,12}\) The actual composition of this crystal as determined by various methods is K0.73Fe1.68Se2, as described in Ref. Tsindlekht et al., 2009. The sizes of the roughly triangular-shaped sample are 7 mm (width), 3 mm (height), and 1.5 mm (thickness). The crystal plate is perpendicular to the **c** lattice axis. The temperature and/or field dependence of the dc magnetic moment was measured in a commercial MPMS5 Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. Prior to recording the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) curves, the SQUID magnetometer was always adjusted to be in a "real" \(H\)0 = 0 state. The ac susceptibility _kh_ and _kh_ was measured with the pickup coil method at amplitude \(h\)0 = 0.05 Oe and frequency 1465 Hz. The sample was inserted into one coil of a balanced pair. The amplitude and phase of the unbalanced signal were measured by a lock-in amplifier in a point-by-point mode. The "homemade" measurement cell of the experimental setup was adapted to the SQUID magnetometer. The block diagram of this setup was published elsewhere.[14] All measurements have been performed for dc and ac fields parallel to the **ab** plane.

(i) \(M(T)\)_curves_. The ZFC and field-cooled (FC) magnetization curves of K\({}_{0.8}\)Fe\({}_{2.5}\)Se\({}_{2}\) were measured at 11.5 Oe and are depicted in Fig. 1. The ZFC branch shows a diamagnetic transition at \(T_{c}=31.0\pm 0.5\) K. This transition is not sharp (as expected for a single crystal SC) and it is similar to inhomogeneous materials with a distribution of \(T_{c}\) related to the small spread of stoichiometry inside the sample. The negative FC branch is also shown in the inset. The estimated shielding fraction is about \(-1/4\pi\) emu/cc.

(ii) _Isothermal_\(M(H_{0})\) curves. Isothermal magnetization curves have been measured at various temperatures and selected \(M(H_{0})\) plots measured at 5, 20, 26, and 29 K are shown in Fig. 2. In the Meissner state, the \(M(H_{0})\) curves are linear and \(H_{c1}(T)\) is defined as the field in which \(M(H_{0})\) deviates from linearity (Fig. 2, lower inset).[15] Temperature dependence of \(H_{c1}\) plotted in Fig. 3 (inset) does not follow the conventional BCS behavior. The extrapolation of this curve to \(T=0\) yields \(H_{c1}(0)\approx 130\pm 10\) Oe. The calculated demagnetization factor for this sample is \(\approx\)0.1. Thus the correction to \(H_{c1}\) is about 15 Oe at low temperatures.

The criterion for determining the upper critical field \(H_{c2}(T)\) requires consistency, and no one method is entirely unambiguous. The \(H_{c2}(T)\) values (Fig. 3) were obtained by measuring \(M(T)\) dependence under various applied fields and \(H_{c2}(T)\) was defined as the onset of the negative signal of the ZFC branches as depicted in Fig. 2, inset. Alternatively, above \(T_{c}\) (at 35 K) for high enough applied fields, the measured \(M(H_{0})\) plot is a straight line. \(H_{c2}(T)\) for the various \(M(H_{0})\) plots shown in Fig. 2 were determined as the fields in which they deviate from this straight line (marked by an arrow in Fig. 5). The two methods yield practically the same \(H_{c2}(T)\) values, presented in Fig. 3. Due to the high \(T_{N}\) of the crystal, it is assumed that the same \(M(H_{0})\) line in the normal state can be used for extraction of \(H_{c2}(T)\), as shown in Fig. 3. By using the well-known Werthamer-Helfand-Honenberg (WHH) formula:[16]\(H_{c2}(0)=-0.69T_{c}(dH_{c2}/dT)\), where \(T_{c}\approx 31\) K and the linear slope (close to \(T_{c}\)) \(dH_{c2}/dT\) is \(-9\) kOe\(/\)K, Fig. 3, \(H_{c2}(0)\) obtained is 193 \(\pm\) 6 kOe, a value which is an order of magnitude smaller than that estimated for the same orientation in Tl\({}_{0.58}\)Rb\({}_{0.42}\)Fe\({}_{1.72}\)Se\({}_{2}\)[7] and K\({}_{0.8}\)Fe\({}_{1.83}\)Se\({}_{2}\).[8] It is well accepted that the WHH formula is valid for one-band superconductors and that \(H_{c2}(0)\) might be affected by the complicated multiband structure as observed in various Fe-Se crystals.[17] Hence this \(H_{c2}(0)\) is just a rough estimation. An accurate value can only be achieved by applying high enough magnetic fields. However, for a similar K\({}_{0.8}\)Fe\({}_{1.72}\)Se\({}_{2}\) crystal, \(H_{c2}(0)\) is well above 60 T as shown in Ref. [8].

Using the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) relation for the coherence length, \(\xi=(\Phi_{0}/2\pi\,H_{c2})^{1/2}\), we obtained for K\({}_{0.8}\)Fe\({}_{2.5}\)Se\({}_{2}\)\(\xi(0)\approx 10\) nm. In order to estimate the second characteristic length, namely the penetration depth \(\lambda(0)\), we use the

  useful relationship \(2H_{c1}(0)/H_{c2}(0)=[\ln(\kappa)+0.5]/\kappa^{2}\), where \(\kappa=\lambda(0)/\xi(0)\) is the GL parameter. Solving this equation numerically, we obtained \(\kappa\approx 58\), from which \(\lambda(0)\approx 580\) nm is deduced.

From the experimental hysteresis loop width, the critical current density (\(J_{c}\)) can be estimated by using the Bean critical state model, \(J_{c}=20\Delta M/a(1-a/3b)\), where \(\Delta M\) is the magnetization loop width at a given \(H_{0}\), and \(a\) and \(b\) are the crystal dimensions perpendicular to \(H_{0}\), where \(a<b\). At 5 K for \(H_{0}=10\) kOe, the estimated \(J_{c}\) is \(\approx\)\(10^{3}\) A/cm\({}^{2}\), a value that does not change much with field (up to 50 kOe) and agrees well with Ref. [18]. We are aware of the fact that, for this orientation, an additional term must be added to \(J_{c}\) as shown in Ref. [19]. However, this crude estimated value shows that the materials cannot support large critical currents even at low temperatures. This \(J_{c}\) is much smaller than critical currents of the SC Fe-As based materials, such as Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) and Ba(Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Co\({}_{x}\))As\({}_{2}\).[20]

At 35 K (above \(T_{c}\)) at low \(H_{0}\), the \(M(H_{0})\) curve is not linear as expected for AFM materials (see Ref. [18]) and may contain another minor ferromagnetic (FM) component as an extra phase not detectable by x-ray diffraction (Fig. 4). The slope of the linear part, which reflects the AFM nature of the sample, is \(\approx\)0.0021 emu/mole Oe, which corresponds to \(\approx\)0.77\(\mu_{B}\)/Fe (Fig. 4). This means that for \(\overrightarrow{H_{0}}||\)**ab**, only a small fraction of the total Fe moment is affected by \(H_{0}\). At high \(H_{0}\), \(M(H_{0})\) is composed of a linear (\(\chi_{h}\times H_{0}\)) and a saturation \(M_{S}\) term. In accordance with the estimation, \(\chi_{h}\approx 7.4\times 10^{-6}\) emu/g \(\times\) Oe. Subtracting the linear part yields the saturation moment \(M_{S}=0.033\) emu/g, which is attributed to 0.015% of pure iron. Indeed, the presence of pure Fe was confirmed by our \({}^{57}\)Fe MS studies performed on the same crystal, to be published elsewhere. Irreversibility in \(M(H_{0})\) is observed at low \(H_{0}\), and the hysteresis loop obtained is shown in Fig. 4 (inset). This loop is not symmetric relative to the origin and is known as the exchange-bias (EB) phenomena.[21; 22] EB is associated with the exchange anisotropy created at the interface between AFM and FM materials. The main information deduced from this hysteresis loop is the magnetic coercive field \(H_{c}=130\) Oe and exchange bias \(E_{x}=65\) Oe, which is the loop shift from the origin. The discussion on EB is beyond the scope of the present paper. However, we may intuitively assume that this phenomenon is caused by the FM Fe particles immersed in the AFM matrix. This tiny amount of Fe affects the normal state only. As for the SC state, since \(M(H_{0})\) for Fe are linear at low \(H_{0}\) up to \(\approx\)1 kOe and all \(M(T)\) curves are practically constant at low temperatures, the deviation from linearity to determine \(H_{c1}(T)\), as well as the onset of diamagnetic signals that determine \(H_{c2}\), are not affected by the presence of 0.015% Fe.

The determination of the \(H_{c3}\) by resistivity and ac susceptibility methods has been well known since 1967; see Refs. [23; 24]. It is now well accepted that ac susceptibility studies are a powerful tool for determining the surface superconducting states, including determination of the surface critical field \(H_{c3}(T)\); see Refs. [25; 26] and references therein. A comparison between dc \(M(H_{0})\) and ac susceptibility measurements is depicted in Fig. 5. Figure 5(a) shows the ascending and descending \(M(H_{0})\) curves measured at 29 K and ascending \(M(H_{0})\) curve at 35 K from which \(H_{c2}\) can easily be

  determined (with the accuracy of \(\pm 1\) kOe), as discussed above. Note that the \(H_{0}>H_{c2}\) plot measured at 35 K coincides with the reversible data collected at 29 K. On the other hand, the real \(\chi^{\prime}\) and the imaginary \(\chi^{\prime\prime}\) ac susceptibility plots, measured under the same conditions, demonstrate clearly the existence of SC up to \(H_{c3}>50\) kOe, which is well above \(H_{c2}\approx 13\) kOe. Two more examples of determining \(H_{c3}\) from \(\chi^{\prime}(T)\) and \(\chi^{\prime\prime}(T)\) measured at \(H_{0}=0\) and 50 kOe are presented in Fig. 6. Here we can obtain \(T_{c}(H_{0})\) with an accuracy of about \(\pm 0.5\) K. From the obtained data, \(H_{c3}(T)\) was deduced and shown in Fig. 3. Note that, at \(H_{0}=0\), the value obtained is \(T_{c}\). The slope of the \(H_{c3}(T)\) curve near \(T_{c}\) is \(\approx\)\(-40\) kOe/K. Therefore, the \(H_{c3}/H_{c2}\) ratio is \(\approx\)\(4.4\), a value which is much larger than the 1.7 predicted for single band conventional superconductors.

In several publications, \(H_{c2}(T)\) was deduced from resistivity and/or ac susceptibility measurements. Indeed, these studies provide accurate \(H_{c2}(T)\) values when the dc field is applied perpendicular to the **ab** crystal plane. In this geometry, the nucleation of the SC state starts at \(H_{0}<H_{c2}\).[11] On the other hand, for \(\overline{H_{0}}\) parallel to the ab plane, this nucleation starts at \(H_{c3}\), which is always higher than \(H_{c2}\).[12, 26, 2] For this geometry, \(H_{c2}(T)\) can be determined from bulk measurements, such as dc \(M(H_{0})\) [see Fig. 5(a)] and/or specific heat capacitance studies. Therefore, the high \(H_{c2}(T)\) values reported for \(\overline{H_{0}}\) parallel to the **ab** plane in Refs. [7] and [8] and in several other publications are presumably the surface \(H_{c3}(T)\) plots. This issue needs more consideration.

In summary, we have performed dc and ac magnetization measurements from which all three critical fields for the SC K\({}_{0.8}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)Se\({}_{2}\) single crystal are determined. Evaluating \(H_{c1}(0)\approx 130\) Oe and \(H_{c2}(0)\approx 193\) kOe permits us to calculate the coherence length \(\xi(0)\approx 10\) nm and the penetration depth \(\lambda(0)\approx 580\) nm. Our ac susceptibility study provides for the first time the determination of \(H_{c3}(T)\) for \(\overline{H_{0}}\) parallel to the **ab** plane. The high \(H_{c3}/H_{c2}\approx 4.4\) obtained needs more consideration.
