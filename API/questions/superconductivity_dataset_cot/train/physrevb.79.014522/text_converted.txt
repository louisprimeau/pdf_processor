###### Abstract

The recently discovered iron arsenide superconductors appear to display
a universal set of characteristic features, including proximity to a
magnetically ordered state and robustness of the superconductivity in
the presence of disorder. Here we show that superconductivity in
Fe_(1 + δ)Se, which can be considered the parent compound of the
superconducting arsenide family, is destroyed by very small changes in
stoichiometry. Further, we show that nonsuperconducting Fe_(1 + δ)Se is
not magnetically ordered down to 5 K. These results suggest that robust
superconductivity and immediate instability against an ordered magnetic
state should not be considered as intrinsic characteristics of
iron-based superconducting systems.

## I Introduction

Superconductivity was discovered in 2008 in LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x)
(Ref. 1) with a T_(c) of 26 K. The superconductivity in this arsenide,
and the previously reported LaFePO_(1 − x)F_(x),² is unexpected because
most Fe-based compounds display magnetic ordering at low temperatures.
This family of superconductors, based on Fe₂X₂ (X=P, As) layers of
edge-sharing Fe_(X)4 tetrahedra, has expanded to include doped but
oxygen-free systems, including K⁺/Na⁺-doped AFe₂As₂ (A=Ba,Sr,Ca) (Refs.
3 and 4) and (Li,Na)_(x)FeAs.^(5, 6) Recently, superconductivity at 8 K
has been reported⁷ in chemically analogous FeSe in its tetragonal form.
[β-FeSe; recent publications have referred to this, improperly, as the α
form. In phase diagrams and the original literature, it is the β form
that is tetragonal (cf. Refs. 8 and 9), although a few, e.g., Ref. 10,
refer to tetragonal FeSe as the α form. α is used here to designate the
stoichiometric NiAs-type variant.¹The superconductivity is reported to
increase to 27 K under modest pressure.¹¹The Fe₂Se₂ layers in β-FeSe
(inset of Fig. 1) are analogous to the Fe₂As₂ and Fe₂P₂ layers in the
pnictide and oxypnictide superconductors. The initial report attributed
the superconductivity to a highly selenium deficient phase, FeSe_(0.82)
(Fe_(1.22)Se).⁷ This was quickly followed by a combined x-ray and
neutron-diffraction study that arrived at a composition of
FeSe_(0.92(1)) (Fe_(1.09)Se) (Ref. 12) for the superconductor. Both of
these formulas fall well outside the narrow composition range,
Fe_(1.01)Se-Fe_(1.04)Se, reported for β-FeSe more than 30 years
ago.^(13, 14) Here we show that when prepared so as to prevent the
formation of spurious oxides and oxygen defects in the phase,
superconducting β-FeSe is much closer to stoichiometric than the recent
reports indicate. Further, we find that the superconducting transition
temperature is critically dependent on extremely small changes in the
iron stoichiometry. The highest transition temperatures, T_(c)∼ 8.5 K,
are found when the compound is closest to stoichiometric, with formula
β-Fe_(1.01)Se. With a little more iron excess, at composition
β-Fe_(1.02)Se, T_(c) drops to 5 K and, with slightly more iron,
β-Fe_(1.03)Se is nonsuperconducting down to 0.6 K. Non-superconducting
β-Fe_(1.03)Se does not exhibit a long-range ordered magnetic state but
only the suggestion of spin fluctuations at low temperature. Subtle
differences in the structure indicate that there may be a difference in
defect chemistry between superconducting and nonsuperconducting
compositions. Our results indicate that superconductivity in β-FeSe is
only borderline stable and that it does not directly compete with a
magnetically ordered state.

## II Experimental

Except for "Fe_(1.06)Se" (see below), all samples were prepared from
iron pieces (Johnson-Matthey, 99.98

## III Results and Discussion

Our initial attempts to prepare phase-pure β-FeSe employed the methods
recently described.[7, 12] starting with "freshly cleaned" Fe
(Alfa-Aesar, 99.95

Figure 2: (Color online) (a) EELS, NPD (left inset), and EDX (right
inset) data on β-Fe_(1.01)Se and Fe_(1.05)Se. The EDX analysis on
crystallites of the β-Fe_(1.4)Se phase in the transmission electron
microscope shows the presence of oxygen in Fe_(1.06)Se, and the EELS
data of the L₃ and L₂ peaks confirm that the oxygen is bonded to the
iron (arrows). This is in addition to the Fe₃O₄ present in Fe_(1.06)Se.
(b) Low field susceptibility data of various Fe₃Se samples, showing that
β-Fe_(1.03)Se is nonsuperconducting and that superconductivity improves
going from β-Fe_(1.02)Se to β-Fe_(1.01)Se. For comparison, the
susceptibility of a sample poisoned with oxygen, similar to previous
work, is also shown (dashed line).

more, energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy measurements in the
transmission electron microscope on crystallites of the _b_-FeSe phase
from Fe1.06Se [Fig. 2(a), right inset] showed substantial oxygen
contamination. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) of the iron L3
and L2 edges [Fig. 2(a)] confirms that there is significant oxidation of
the iron in Fe1.06Se, i.e., oxygen is bound to the iron atoms within the
_b_-FeSe such that the formula is Fe1+_b_SeO_Y_, EDX and EELS on a
Fe1.01Se sample (Fe1.01Se annealed at 300 degC) made from very clean
starting materials show no oxygen by EDX and no unexpected oxidation of
the iron by EELS [Fig. 2(a)].

The composition of the _b_-FeSe phase was confirmed to be nearly
stoichiometric by Rietveld refinements of NPD data on both Fe1.06Se and
Fe1.01Se annealed at 300 degC. When freely refined, the composition of
the tetragonal phase in Fe1.06Se is nearly stoichiometric (Table I, col.
1), and a similar result was obtained for Fe1.01Se (Table I, col. 2 and
Fig. 1). To best determine the stoichiometry and to see if we could
locate the origin of any nonstoichiometry, we performed free fits to the
data as a function of fixed doping levels, with excess iron in
interstitial sites [18] and with selenium vacancies. The refinement
agreement statistics _R_wp (minimum for the best agreement) for those
refinements as a function of hypothetical stoichiometry are plotted in
the inset of Fig. 1. The best agreement is centered at the
stoichiometric FeSe composition, with the breadth of the minimum
indicating a composition of Fe1.01 <= 0.02Se. Thus, although these
measurements do not have sufficient sensitivity to determine the
stoichiometry to better than +- 0.02, the nearly ideal stoichiometry of
the _b_-FeSe phase, in agreement with the results in the older
literature, [13, 14] is clearly confirmed. The compositions Fe1.09Se
(Ref. [12]) and Fe1.22Se (Ref. [7]) are not consistent with these data,
as the refinement statistics are markedly worse (near the top right of
the right inset, Fig. 1 for Fe1.09Se with Se vacancies, and off scale
for Fe1.22Se).

The magnetic characterization of the superconducting transition in a
selection of our samples, measured by low-field dc magnetization, is
shown in Fig. 2(b). The data show that Fe1.01Se prepared at a
temperature of 300 degC is a superconductor with a sharp transition near
 8.5 K. This is in contrast to a sample poisoned with oxygen (dashed
line, similar to the original literature report [7]). Furthermore, a
sample that is slightly more iron rich, Fe1.02Se annealed at 380 degC,
shows a reduced _T_c. Finally superconductivity is absent for Fe1.03Se
annealed at 400 degC. This reflects an extreme dependence of the
superconducting properties on preparative conditions, including
stoichiometry and temperature.

Our data indicate that the superconductivity, the stoichiometry, and the
crystal structure are correlated in the _b_-FeSe-type phase. Figure 3(a)
shows the superconducting transition temperature _T_c versus the
crystallographic _c/a_ ratio for a number of the samples in this system.
Several features are evident. Samples prepared at lower temperatures or
with lower iron content display _c/a_ ratios just above 1.464 and also
display the highest transition temperatures. Higher iron contents or
higher synthesis temperatures yield larger _c/a_ ratios and reduced
_T_c’s. Samples prepared with the highest iron content, Fe1.03Se, show
no superconductivity to 0.6 K, irrespective of the synthesis
temperature. These samples also display abnormally small _c/a_ ratios
near 1.461. Two distinct structure/superconductivity regions are
therefore clearly seen in Fig. 3(a). The inset of Fig. 3(a) shows the
dependence of the _c/a_ ratio on starting composition for two
representative preparation temperatures. In both cases, _c/a_ initially
rises with increasing Fe content, but by the composition Fe1.09Se the
_c/a_ ratio is much reduced.

We postulate that this peculiar dependence of _c/a_ ratio on iron
content and the accompanying dramatic disappearance of superconductivity
for Fe1.03Se are due to a change in how the nonstoichiometry is
accommodated in the phase. The most likely scenario is a change from Se
vacancies at low Fe excess to Fe interstitials at high Fe excess. This
may also explain why the _c/a_ ratio changes for a given nominal
composition as the synthesis temperature is changed–the stability of the
different types of defects is no doubt temperature dependent. Further
studies will be of interest to elucidate the origin of this behavior.

On the basis of these experiments, we construct a phase diagram for the
Fe-Se system near the 1:1 stoichiometry in Fig. 3(b). Samples quenched
from above 455 degC contain significant fractions of three phases (not
possible for equilibrium conditions in a binary system). This is
consistent with the proposal in the old literature that iron-rich
hexagonal _b_-FeSe, stable at high temperatures, converts to tetragonal
FeSe on cooling. [8] Thus we assign 455 degC as the upper limit of
temperature stability for _b_-FeSe. This agrees well with the reported
decomposition temperature of 457 degC. [9] Additionally, we find that
_b_-FeSe is unstable at low temperatures: there is a slow conversion of
the tetragonal _b_-Fe1+_b_Se phase to a hexagonal NiAs structure-type
(_a_-FeSe) phase, with larger lattice parameters than are found for
"Fe2;Se8 (Ref. [19])," below approximately 300 degC. This hexagonal
phase is
