###### Abstract

We report on point-contact tunneling into polycrystalline HgBa\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) superconductors with a \(T_{c}\) onset of 97 K. Tunneling data follow the general trend of the best curves seen in cuprate high-temperature superconductors, but these show significantly _lower_ and _flatter_ subgap conductance values than any other cuprate and they can be reproducibly obtained. By fitting the data to a smeared BCS density of states, the energy gap has been determined and the smearing parameter is so small that it is comparable to thermal smearing.

## I Introduction

Tunneling measurements have been an important probe of high-temperature superconductors (HTS), providing a direct measure of the superconducting energy-gap parameter \(\Delta\) and giving insight into the quasiparticle density of states. In this paper, we report point-contact tunneling on the recently discovered HgBa\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) (Hg 1:2:0:1) compound[1] using a Au tip onto two polycrystalline samples[2] which have \(T_{c}\) (onsets) of 97 and 95 K. In comparison with previous tunneling into HTS cuprates,[3] the conductances are unusually symmetrical, display well-defined peaks, and have _lower_ and _flatter_ subgap (\(V<\Delta/e\)) values. The zero-bias conductance is typically 6% of the normal state and can be reproducibly obtained.

The above \(T_{c}\) is unusually high for a compound with only one CuO\({}_{2}\) layer per unit cell. The simple crystal structure of HgBa\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) consists of single CuO\({}_{2}\) layers separated by BaO-Hg-BaO insulating regions: the distance between CuO\({}_{2}\) layers[1,2] is only 9.5 A. Such a small spacing between CuO\({}_{2}\) layers may lead to better intrinsic superconducting properties in a magnetic field.[4, 5, 6] This compound is the first member of the homologous series HgBa\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{n-1}\)Cu\({}_{n}\)O\({}_{2n+1+\delta}\), similar to the single-thallium-layer series TlBa\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{n-1}\)Cu\({}_{n}\)O\({}_{2n+\delta}\). The Hg 1:2:2:3 phase was first synthesized as a multiphase component[7, 8] (\(T_{c}\) above 130 K) and subsequently as a single phase with a record high \(T_{c}\) of 135 K.[9] Further enhancements of \(T_{c}\) up to 150 K are reported[10] in an applied pressure of 150 kbar.

## II Experiment

Samples of Hg 1:2:0:1 were synthesized from stoichiometric mixtures of HgO and Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{3}\), as previously described,[2] and then annealed at 300 degC in oxygen. X-ray diffraction studies confirmed all samples to be single phase without any detectable impurities. ac susceptibility was measured in a 1 G, 100-Hz field using a Lake Shore Cryotronic susceptometer. Curve \(A\) in Fig. 1 shows the susceptibility of a bulk sample (tunneling sample _A_) which was powdered before susceptibility measurements. It exhibits a sharp transition with an onset \(T_{c}\) of 97 K and a full shielding fraction, consistent with the isolated grains of the polycrystalline material being uniform and fully superconducting. Susceptibility data (Fig. 1, curve _B_) on the bulk tunneling sample \(B\) (i.e., not ground to a powder before measuring), exhibits two transitions typical of that found in polycrystalline materials with weak coupling between grains.[11] It is suggested[11] that the first transition reflects the intragranular superconductivity of the decoupled grains in the polycrystalline sample, followed by a broader transition resulting from the intergranular coupling across the sample.

All low-temperature measurements were done with the apparatus cooled by exchange gas to liquid \({}^{4}\)He. After transferring liquid \({}^{4}\)He, we waited about 5 h for thermal stability so that stable junctions could be maintained. Raising the temperature above the cryogen boiling point with a heater was possible, but resulted in much poorer stability of the tunneling contact. As in previous cases,[12, 13, 14] an insulating surface prevented vacuum tunneling and the Au tip was used mechanically to cleave and/or scrape the surface before a measurable current was obtained. The resistance of resulting junctions could be varied by adjusting the force of the tip on the sample.

Curve \(A\) (corresponds to tunneling sample _A_) is for a bulk sample, which was powdered before susceptibility measurements. Curve \(B\) corresponds to the bulk tunneling sample \(B\).

 The current-voltage characteristic \(I(V)\) was monitored while the tip was maneuvered to obtain an acceptable junction. First derivative data \(dI/dV\) were obtained using a Kelvin bridge with the usual lock-in techniques.[13]

## III Results and discussion

Experimentally, no differences were observed for the two samples. Typical experimental conductances (\(\sigma_{s}\!=\!dI/dV\)) are shown in Figs. 2(a)-2(c). The high degree of symmetry is unusual for tunneling between asymmetrical electrodes of a normal metal and a cuprate HTS, although it is generally found for conventional superconductors. For all such stable superconductor-insulator-normal (SIN) junctions, the high-voltage (background) conductance usually increases with voltage [see Fig. 2(a)] as is commonly found in HTS, and can be attributed[15, 16] to the ordinary parabolic tunneling conductance.[17] Several junctions showed a flat background conductance [see Fig. 2(b)] and one junction showed a decreasing background conductance [see Fig. 2(c)]. Such a decreasing background has also been observed previously in other cuprates.[18] Here in all plots, positive voltage means that the Au tip is at a positive voltage relative to the Hg 1:2:0:1 sample.

In order to proceed, the conductances need to be normalized (i.e., divided by the normal-state value \(\sigma_{u}\)). Direct measurements of \(\sigma_{u}\) can be made at \(T\!>\!T_{c}\), but for HTS this is difficult due to the different thermal expansions in the tip assembly materials. However, \(\sigma_{s}\) is expected to approximate \(\sigma_{u}\) at high voltages, so we fit the high-voltage data to a fourth-order polynomial to obtain an estimate of \(\sigma_{u}\) [dashed lines in Figs. 2(a)-2(c)]. The tunneling data shown in Fig. 2(b) are interesting because of the very flat background and the data can be normalized by a constant (over the narrow voltage range), which ensures that no additional structure is introduced by this procedure.

When \(\sigma_{s}\) is normalized by \(\sigma_{u}\), estimated in this way, we arrive at the normalized conductances [solid lines in Figs. 2(d)-2(d)], which can be compared to theory. Usually, HTS tunneling results are compared to the smeared BCS density of states, first proposed by Dynes, Narayanamurti, and Garno,[9] in which

Figure 2: (a)–(c): Experimental conductances (solid lines) with the fitted normal-state conductances (dashed lines) for junctions No. 1, No. 2 of sample \(B\) and junction No. 1 of sample \(A\), respectively; (d)–(0): The solid lines are the corresponding normalized conductances, while the dashed lines are the smeared BCS fits including thermal smearing. Experimental \(I(V)\) curve for junction No. 1 of sample \(B\) is shown in Fig. 2(a) as an inset. All tunneling curves here were measured at \(T\!=\!4.2\) K.

  \[N_{s}(E) = {\rm Re}\{(E - i\Gamma)/\{(E - i\Gamma)^{2} - \Delta^{2}1\}^{1/2}\}\,\,,\]

where G is a smearing parameter to account for lifetime effects, such as inelastic scattering. The normalized conductance is then given by [17]

\[\sigma_{s}/\sigma_{s} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}N_{s}(E)[ - \partial f(E + eV)/\partial(eV)]dE\,\,,\]

where the Fermi function \(f\) accounts for thermal smearing. The fits using Eq. (2), shown as dashed lines in Figs. 2(d)-2(f), provide values of \(\Delta\) and \(\Gamma\). All tunneling curves here were measured at \(T \sim 4.2\) K. Note that all subgap conductances [Figs. 2(d)-2(f)] are very low and flat, resulting in small values of \(\Gamma\). The small \(\Gamma\) (\(\sim\) 1 meV) means that thermal smearing (\(k_{B}T = 0.36\) meV) cannot be ignored in the above procedure. In our previous work [15, 16] on other cuprate HTS as well as other tunneling studies,[3] the normalized conductance was fitted to Eq. (1) directly because \(\Gamma\) was much larger than \(k_{B}T\).

Note that all the junctions of Fig. 2 are fit with \(\Gamma/\Delta = 6 - 8\)%, making this the _lowest reproducible_ value of all cuprate HTS. The subgap conductance in Fig. 2(f) is quite flat and agrees extremely well with the BCS expression [Eq. (2)] with only small smearing. It is thus much closer to what would be expected for \(s\)-wave superconductivity than is typically found in other cuprates.[20] A flat subgap conductance was also reported by Hasegawa _et al.[21]_ using a scanning tunnel microscope on a single junction of YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7 - 8}\), but the preponderance of data on YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7 - 8}\) suggests more paraboliclike subgap conductances.[22]

Figure 3 is an example of \(\sigma_{s}\) (measured at 4.2 K) showing well-defined conductance peaks with an energy gap, \(\Delta \sim 5 - 6\) meV. The tunneling characteristics of this junction showed changes when the temperature was raised from 4.2 to \(\sim\)11 K using a heater. This indicates that the gamlike features are indeed due to the superconducting density of states and not a charging effect which would be insensitive to this temperature change.

The energy gaps \(\Delta\) determined according to the above procedure for 24 junctions range from \(\sim\) 5 to 20 meV. The origin of the spread in \(\Delta\) is unknown, but this could be an indication that there is a considerable variation in \(T_{c}\), which possibly results from variations in oxygen content of HgBa\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4 + 8}\) near the sample surface. It is known[2] that \(T_{c}\) can be increased up to 97 K for \(\delta \sim 0.06\) on annealing in oxygen at 300 degC for 24 h. On annealing in argon at 500 degC for 24 h, the \(T_{c}\) drops to 59 K for \(\delta \sim 0.01\). Further reduction decreases the \(T_{c}\) to \(\sim\) 44 K, after which the compound decomposes.[2] Also the Hg 1:2:0:1 samples are found to be electromagnetically granular.[3] Thus it is quite possible that we are probing local properties of individual grains with different \(\delta\) values and hence different \(T_{c}\). We suspect, therefore, that the small gaps (\(\sim\) 5 - 6 meV) observed in some cases are associated with this minimum value of \(T_{c}\) that can be obtained before decomposition. Although surface deterioration upon exposure to moisture causes no observed change in the bulk \(T_{c}\) (with only minor changes in x-ray pattern),[11] it may reduce the \(T_{c}\) of some grains on the surface which are probed by the tunneling tip.

Broadened conductance peaks [e.g., see Fig. 2(c)] suggest a small distribution of gap values, and our fitted value of \(\Delta\) is within this distribution. It is difficult to obtain an accurate value of \(2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}\) due to the spread of the energy gaps and the unknown \(T_{c}\) associated with each junction. Using \(\Delta\) for our best junctions (\(\sim\) 15 meV) together with the onset \(T_{c}\) of 97 K, implies a lower limit of \(2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c} \sim 3.6\). This is significantly lower than the usual tunneling results for HTS cuprates.

In summary, the SIN tunneling data of Hg 1:2:0:1 are quite symmetrical and follow the general trend of the best curves seen in cuprate HTS, but with the _lowest_ and _flatest_ subgap conductances compared to other cuprates, and both features are obtained reproducibly. Energy gaps \(\Delta\) are determined using a smeared BCS expression _including_ thermal smearing.
