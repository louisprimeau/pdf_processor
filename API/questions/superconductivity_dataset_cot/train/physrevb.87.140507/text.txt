The observed powder x-ray diffraction pattern for the Sn\({}_{0.6}\)In\({}_{0.4}\)Te is consistent with the pattern for the SnTe (\(x=0\)) parent phase. Both materials have a cubic \(Fm3m\) structure. The lattice parameter calculated from a fit to the data is \(a=0.6280(1)\) nm for Sn\({}_{0.6}\)In\({}_{0.4}\)Te, while the parent compound SnTe has a lattice parameter of \(a=0.6321(1)\) nm. Our results agree well with the published data for both the \(x=0\) and the \(x=0.4\).[16]

The temperature dependence of the resistivities of the \(x=0.4\) superconducting sample and the nonsuperconducting SnTe (\(x=0\)) are shown in Fig. 1(a). In zero field, the superconducting transition temperature of Sn\({}_{0.6}\)In\({}_{0.4}\)Te, \(T_{c}^{\rm onset}\), is 4.70(5) K. The width of the transition, \(\Delta T_{c}\), is over 1 K with zero resistance, indicating the presence of a continuous superconducting pathway observed at \(T_{c}^{\rm onset}=3.50(5)\) K. The \(x=0\) nonsuperconducting sample shows an almost linear dependence of resistivity with \(T\) over the entire range of the measurement.

The resistivity of the \(x=0.4\) sample at temperatures around \(T_{c}\) in different applied fields is shown in Fig. 1(b). While there is a gradual shift in \(T_{c}^{\rm onset}\) with applied field, there is no broadening of the superconducting transition.

A superconducting transition in Sn\({}_{0.6}\)In\({}_{0.4}\)Te was also observed in dc magnetic susceptibility (\(\chi_{\rm dc}=M/H\)) measurements, which were carried out as a function of temperature in applied fields from 3 mT to 0.8 T. Figure 2(a) shows the zero-field-cooled warming data for three applied magnetic fields. The magnetization observed in the superconducting state does not saturate at the lowest temperature measured. The lower critical field \(H_{c1}\) is difficult to determine. We observed in dc magnetic susceptibility (\(\chi_{\rm dc}=M/H\)) measurements, which were carried out as a function of temperature in applied fields from 3 mT to 0.8 T. Figure 2(a) shows the zero-field-cooled warming data for three applied magnetic fields. The magnetization observed in the superconducting state does not saturate at the lowest temperature measured. The lower critical field \(H_{c1}\) is difficult to determine. We found the ac and dc measurements, \(T_{c}^{\rm onset}\) is 4.75(5) K. Here again, the superconducting transition appears relatively broad (\(\Delta T_{c}\approx 1\) K). The in-phase component of the ac susceptibility \(\chi_{\rm ac}^{\prime}\) starts to flatten when the resistive transition is complete. The transition is accompanied by a small dissipative peak in the out-of-phase signal \(\chi_{\rm ac}^{\prime\prime}\). At the lowest \(T\), the diamagnetic screening reaches a value of 98% of the ideal value.

The temperature dependence of the upper critical field \(H_{c2}\) obtained from the resistivity measurements is plotted in Fig. 3. Using the values of \(H_{c2}\) for \(T_{c}^{\rm zero}\) we evaluate the zero temperature limit of the upper critical field to be \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)=1.42(3)\) T by fitting our data to the generalized Ginzburg-Landau model: \(H_{c2}(T)=H_{c2}(0)\frac{(1-t^{2})}{(1+t^{2})}\). The value of \(H_{c2}(0)\) is far below the BCS Pauli paramagnetic limit (\(B_{c2}^{\rm Pauli}=1.83T_{c}\sim 6.85\) T). Using the zero-temperature relation \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi^{2}\,(0)\), we estimate the coherence length \(\xi_{0}\) to be 15.2(2) nm, and then using \(B_{c2}(0)/B_{c1}(0)=2\kappa^{2}/\ln\kappa\)

(b) Temperature dependence of the ac susceptibility of Sn\({}_{0.6}\)In\({}_{0.4}\)Te showing \(\chi_{\rm ac}^{\prime\prime}\) and \(\chi_{\rm ac}^{\prime\prime}\) through the superconducting transition. A demagnetization factor has been applied to account for the platelike shape of the sample (Ref. [17]).

Figure 1: (Color online) (a) Temperature dependence of the resistivity of Sn\({}_{0.6}\)In\({}_{0.4}\)Te and SnTe in zero field. Sn\({}_{0.6}\)In\({}_{0.4}\)Te shows a superconducting transition with a \(T_{c}^{\rm onset}\) at \(\sim\)4.70(5) K and zero resistance \(T_{c}^{\rm onset}\) at 3.50(5) K. (b) The resistivity of superconducting Sn\({}_{0.6}\)In\({}_{0.4}\)Te at temperatures around \(T_{c}\) in increasing applied magnetic fields. The onset of the transition shifts to lower temperatures with increasing field without any broadening of the transition.

  we estimate the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, \(k\) = 56.4(8), with the penetration depth _l_(0) = 860(40) nm.[18] The agreement of the transition temperatures measured by both ac and dc susceptibility as well as resistivity is clear evidence of bulk superconductivity in Sn\({}_{1-x}\)In\({}_{x}\)Te.

Further evidence for the bulk superconductivity is given by the specific heat \(C\). Figure 4(a) shows _C_/_T_ against \(T\)2 for an \(x\) = 0.4 sample in different applied magnetic fields. The inset shows the heat capacity around the transition in zero field and in a field of 3 T, high enough to drive the sample into the normal state. The heat capacity in the normal state can be fit to the expression \(C/T=\gamma+\beta T^{3}+\delta T^{4}\), where the term linear in \(T\) represents the electronic contribution and the higher-order terms represent the lattice contribution,[19] giving \(\gamma=2.62(2)\) mJ/mol K, \(b\) = 0.635(4) mJ/mol K\({}^{4}\), \(d\) = 8.0(1) _m_J/mol K.[6] The value of \(b\) corresponds to a Debye temperature \(\Theta_{D}=183(1)\) K. \(\Delta C/\gamma T_{c}=1.26(4)\), which is slightly smaller than the theoretical BCS value of 1.43 in the weak-coupling limit. Using the McMillan equation for the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}=(\theta_{D}/1.45)\exp[-1.04(1+\lambda_{\rm e-ph})/\lambda_{\rm e-ph}- \mu^{*}(1+0.62\lambda_{\rm e-ph})]\), where the Coulomb pseudopotential \(\mu^{*}\) is assumed to be 0.13, the electron-phonon coupling constant \(\lambda_{\rm e-ph}\) is estimated to be 0.67.[18, 20] This value of \(\lambda_{\rm e-ph}\) suggests Sn\({}_{0.6}\)In\({}_{0.4}\)Te should be classified as a weak-intermediate coupling superconductor. A similar disagreement between the strength of the coupling inferred from the jump in heat capacity around _T_c and complementary data was noted in studies of superconducting Sn-In-Te doped with much lower levels of In.[11]

The magnitude of the normal-state resistivity of SnTe (with no In) and that of Sn\({}_{0.6}\)In\({}_{0.4}\)Te samples are comparable. The resistance of the brittle Sn\({}_{0.6}\)In\({}_{0.4}\)Te samples increases with thermal cycling, but the form of the \(\rho(T)\) curves remains the same. The temperature dependence of the resistivity in SnTe, the parent TCI material, and the resistance ratio \(R_{300\,\rm K}/R_{10\,\rm K}\) of \(\sim\)17, indicate that SnTe forms with a reasonable number of carriers. The resistance ratio \(R_{300\,\rm K}/R_{10\,\rm K}\) of the Sn\({}_{0.6}\)In\({}_{0.4}\)Te sample is only \(\sim\)1.3. The resistivity behavior for the \(x\) = 0.4 sample is similar to that observed by Sasaki _et al.[13]_ for a sample with \(x\) = 0.045, indicating that the behavior remains unchanged when the In substitution levels are increased tenfold. The superconducting behavior seen in the In-doped samples (from low levels of around 2% to levels as high as 40%, as in the present study) therefore arises out of a poor conductor rather than from a true semiconducting phase. We have also performed resistivity measurements on a range of Sn\({}_{1-x}\)Te\({}_{1+x}\) samples for 0 \(\leqslant x\leqslant\) 0.06 and found that these variations in the relative Sn/Te content do not result in large changes in the absolute value or temperature dependence of the measured resistivity between 2 and 300 K.

We briefly address the implications of our results on the search for the occurrence of topological superconductivity in the Sn-In-Te system. Previous studies of the Fermi surface of the \(x\) = 0.045 crystals by Sato _et al.[14]_ have provided evidence to show that the band inversion that is observed in the parent TCI material, SnTe, is still present in the

The inset shows the region around _T_c for the data collected in 0 and 3 T. The solid line shows a fit to \(C/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4}\) as discussed in the text. (b) Temperature dependence of the difference between \(C\) in the superconducting (\(\mu_{0}H=0\) T) and the normal state (\(\mu_{0}H=3\) T). The peak in the curve occurs at \(T_{c}^{\rm zero}=3.50(5)\) K, determined from the transport and magnetic susceptibility data. The red line shows an extrapolation of the peak to \(T_{c}^{\rm mid}=3.90(5)\) K.

The solid symbols were determined from \(T_{c}^{\rm zero}\) in the \(\rho(T)\) data, and the solid line is a fit to the data using a GL model (see text), giving \(\mu_{0}H_{x}(0)=1.42(3)\) T. The open symbols were determined from \(T_{c}^{\rm onset}\) in the \(\rho(T)\) data and \(H_{c2}\) values from \(M(H)\) loops collected at fixed \(T\). The inset shows \(T\) dependence of the lower critical field \(H_{x}(T)\). The dashed line is a fit assuming a parabolic \(T\) dependence, giving \(H_{x}(0)=0.90(3)\) mT.

  Sn-In-Te. The observation of topological surface states in the In-substituted SnTe system is promising for the study of topological superconductivity in semiconducting materials with similar characteristics to SnTe. Our results definitely point to the Sn-In-Te materials exhibiting bulk superconductivity and in addition, homogeneous materials can be obtained with ease, in stark contrast to the Cu,Bi\({}_{2}\)Se\({}_{3}\) system. Regarding the pairing mechanisms in play in these superconductors, there are suggestions that the superconductivity in Sn-In-Te may arise from odd-parity pairing.[13, 14] LuPtBi, which has been recently proposed to be a topological superconductor with possible odd-parity pairing,[10] crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric crystal structure and in such systems, generally, mixed singlet-triplet pairing is a possibility. The Sn-In-Te superconductors, however, form in a centrosymmetric crystal structure, and the only evidence for odd-parity pairing in the Sn-In-Te comes from the point contact spectroscopy studies by Sasaki _et al.[13]_ Our results probe the characteristics of Sn\({}_{0.6}\)In\({}_{0.4}\)Te and confirm that this material is a bulk superconductor and hence a good candidate in the search for 3D topological crystalline superconductivity. Further investigations of the surface states of this superconductor will be required to search for the presence of exotic surface states. The dependence of the superconducting properties on the level of In substitution also needs careful investigation in order to optimize the superconducting characteristics of these materials. These studies are currently underway.
