###### Abstract

Measurements of the magnetic field penetration depth \lambda in the pyrochlore superconductor RbOs_{2}O_{6} (T_{c} = 6.3 K) were carried out by means of the muon-spin-rotation (\muSR) technique. At low temperatures \lambda^{-2}(T) saturates and becomes constant below T = 0.2T_{c}, in agreement with what is expected for weak-coupled s-wave BCS superconductors. The value of \lambda at T = 0 was found to be in the range of 250-300 nm. \muSR and equilibrium magnetization measurements both reveal that at low temperatures \lambda is almost (at the level of 10%) independent of the applied magnetic field. This result suggests that the superconducting energy gap in RbOs_{2}O_{6} is isotropic.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in pyrochlore-related oxides has attracted considerable interest in the study of these materials.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] However, until now there has been no agreement about the nature of the superconducting pairing mechanism in these compounds. On the one hand, based on the results of the specific heat,[9] nuclear quadrupole resonance[10] (NQR), and muon-spin rotation[11, 12] (\muSR) experiments, Cd_{2}Re_{2}O_{7} is suggested to be a weak-coupled isotropic BCS superconductor. The specific heat,[5] pressure effect on the magnetic field penetration depth,[13] and nuclear magnetic resonance[14] (NMR) measurements of RbOs_{2}O_{6} and the band structure calculations of KOs_{2}O_{6} (Ref. [15]) also point to the conventional type of superconductivity. On the other hand, second critical field H_{c2},[4]\muSR,[16] and specific heat[4] experiments in KOs_{2}O_{6}, as well as H_{c2} measurements in RbOs_{2}O_{6} (Ref. [7]), specific heat experiments in RbOs_{2}O_{6} and CsOs_{2}O_{6} (Ref. [17]), suggest an unconventional type of pairing.

The magnetic field penetration depth \lambda is one of the fundamental lengths of a superconductor. The temperature dependence \lambda(T) reflects the quasiparticle density of states available for thermal excitations and therefore probes the superconducting gap structure. The shape of \lambda(T) and the zero-temperature value \lambda(0) provide information about the superconducting mechanism and set a length scale for the screening of an external magnetic field. In addition, the field dependence of \lambda at low temperatures may reflect the anisotropy of the superconducting energy gap.[11, 18] In this paper, we report on magnetic field penetration depth measurements down to 30 mK in RbOs_{2}O_{6} by means of the transverse-field muon-spin-rotation (TF-\muSR) technique (see, e.g., Ref. [19]). The temperature dependence of \lambda^{-2} saturates at low temperatures and becomes constant below T = 0.2T_{c}. This behavior agrees with what is expected for weak-coupled s-wave BCS superconductors. Measurements of the magnetic field dependence of \lambda by means of TF-\muSR and magnetization reveal that at low temperatures \lambda is almost field independent. This result suggests that the superconducting energy gap in RbOs_{2}O_{6} is isotropic. The ratio 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c} was found to be in the range of 3.09-3.60, which is close to the weak-coupling BCS value of 3.52.

The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we describe the sample preparation procedure and the TF-\muSR technique as a tool to measure the magnetic field penetration depth \lambda. Section III A comprises studies of the temperature dependence of \lambda. In Secs. III B and III C we discuss the calculation of the absolute value of \lambda and its magnetic field dependence. In Sec. III D results of the dependence of the zero-temperature superconducting gap \Delta_{0} on the superconducting critical temperature and the magnetic field are reported. The conclusions follow in Sec. IV.

## II Sample preparation and experimental techniques

### Sample preparation

Polycrystalline samples of RbOs_{2}O_{6} were synthesized by a procedure similar to that described in Refs. [3, 5, and 6]. A stoichiometric amount of OsO_{2} (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%) and Rb_{2}O (Aldrich, 99%) was thoroughly mixed in an argon-filled dry box and pressed into pellets. The pellets were put to a quartz tube which was evacuated and sealed. The tube was heated up to 600 ^{\circ}C and kept at this temperature for 24 h. According to the x-ray analysis, the resulting sample contained two phases: namely, pyrochlore RbOs_{2}O_{6} and RbOsO_{4}. RbOsO_{4} was removed after 2 h etching in a 10% solution of HCl and subsequent washing with water and drying at 100 ^{\circ}C. The x-ray diffraction pattern of the post-treated sample is shown in Fig. 1 where all reflections can be indexed on the basis of the pyrochlore cell with a lattice parameter a = 10.1137 (1)A.

 

## B. Tf-\muSr

The \muSR experiments were performed at the \piM3 beamline at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Villigen, Switzerland). The sample was field cooled from above T_{c} to 30 mK in fields of 2.5 T and 1 T and to \approx1.6 K in a series of fields ranging from 5 mT to 0.6 T. We used the transverse field \muSR to probe the local magnetic field distribution P(B) inside the superconducting sample in the mixed state. The second moment of P(B) is connected directly with the magnetic field penetration depth \lambda.[20]

The \muSR signal was observed in the usual time-differential way by monitoring the positron rate from the \mu^{+} decay as a function of the elapsed \mu^{+} lifetime in the positron telescopes. The time dependence of the positron rate is given by the expression[21]

\[\frac{dN}{dt}=N_{0}\frac{1}{\tau_{\mu}}e^{-t/\tau_{\mu}}[1+aP(t)]+bg,\] (1)

where N_{0} is a normalization constant, bg is a time-independent background, \tau_{\mu}=2.197 03(4) \times 10^{-6} s is the \mu^{+} lifetime, a is the maximum decay asymmetry for the particular detector telescope (a\sim 0.18 in our case), and P(t) is the spin polarization of the muon ensemble:

\[P(t)=\int P(B)\cos(\gamma_{\mu}Bt+\phi)dB.\] (2)

Here P(B) is the field distribution inside a sample, \gamma_{\mu}=2 \pi\times 135.5342 MHz/T is the muon gyromagnetic ratio, and \phi is the angle between the initial muon polarization and the effective symmetry axis of a positron detector. To link P(t) and P(B) one can use the algorithm of fast Fourier transform or the direct least-squares fit of P(t) by the sum of precessions in discrete fields:[22]

\[P(t)=\sum_{i}A_{i}\cos(\gamma_{\mu}B_{i}t+\phi),\] (3)

where A_{i} are varied and B_{i} are fixed with spacing \Delta B\approx\pi/(\gamma_{\mu}I_{\rm max}); t_{\rm max}\sim 10^{-5} s is the time window of the \muSR technique.

Magnetic field distributions inside the RbOs_{2}O_{6} sample in the normal (7.5 K) and the mixed (1.55 K) states after field cooling in a magnetic field of 0.5 T obtained by the procedure (3) are shown in Fig. 2. In the normal state, a single line at the position of the external magnetic field with broadening arising from the nuclear magnetic moments is seen. Below T_{c} the field distribution is broadened and asymmetric. For a better visualization, the fit of P(B) by three Gaussian lines is represented by dotted lines in Fig. 2. Two wide lines with the mean frequencies below the external field are used to describe the asymmetric line shape in the superconducting part of the sample. The narrow line seen at a field a little bit above the external field suggests that part of the sample is in a normal state. The slight shift of this line to the higher fields is associated with the diamagnetism of the superconducting grains. It leads to an increase of the local field in the nonsuperconducting parts of the sample. This behavior is often observed in samples with less than 100% superconducting volume fraction.[16, 23] The superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be \simeq70%, close to the specific heat measurements[5] performed on a similarly synthesized sample where the superconducting fraction was estimated about 80%.

To obtain the second moment of the asymmetric field distribution in the superconducting state we used the procedure similar to Refs. 24 and 25. All the \muSR spectra taken at

Figure 2: Typical internal field distributions measured by the \muSR technique inside the RbOs_{2}O_{6} sample above (a) and below (b) T_{c} after field cooling in a magnetic field of 0.5 T. Below T_{c} the field distribution is broadened and asymmetric. The lines represent the best fit with Gaussian line shapes. See text for details.

 <\!0.85T_{c} where the three lines are resolved were analyzed by fitting a three-component expression to the P(t) data:

\[P(t) = A_{b}\exp(-\ \sigma_{b}^{2}t^{2}/2)\cos(\gamma_{\mu}B_{b}t+\phi)\] (4) \[+\sum_{i=1}^{2}A_{i}\exp(-\ \sigma_{i}^{2}t^{2}/2)\cos(\gamma_{\mu}B_{i}t+\phi).\]

The first term with small \sigma_{b}<\!0.3 MHz and B_{b} close to the applied field corresponds to the background muons stopping in parts of the cryostat and in the nonsuperconducting parts of the sample. The sum corresponds to the asymmetric field distribution inside the superconductor. At 0.85T_{c}\!<\!T\!<\!T_{c} the two broad lines (see, e.g, Fig. 2) responsible for superconducting state merge with each other and the analysis is statistically correct for one superconducting signal. At T\!\!>\!T_{c} the analysis is simplified to the background term only with \sigma_{b}\!=\!\sigma_{nm}\!\sim\!0.1 MHz resulting from the nuclear moments of the sample.

The superconducting term in Eq. (4) is equivalent to the field distribution

\[P(B)=\gamma_{\mu}\sum_{i=1}^{2}\frac{A_{i}}{\sigma_{i}}\exp\left(-\frac{\gamma _{\mu}^{2}(B-B_{i})^{2}}{2\sigma_{i}^{2}}\right).\] (5)

For this distribution the mean field and second moment are [24, 25]

\[\langle B\rangle=\sum_{i=1}^{2}\frac{A_{i}B_{i}}{A_{1}+A_{2}}\] (6)

and

\[\langle\Delta B^{2}\rangle=\sum_{i=1}^{2}\frac{A_{i}}{A_{1}+A_{2}}[(\sigma/ \gamma_{\mu})^{2}-[B_{i}-\langle B\rangle]^{2}].\] (7)

The extracted second moment of the magnetic field distribution of the vortex lattice can be expressed in frequency units

\[\sigma_{sc}=[\gamma_{\mu}^{2}\langle\Delta B^{2}\rangle-\sigma_{nm}^{2}]^{1/2},\] (8)

where \sigma_{nm} is the additional broadening due to the nuclear moments measured at T\!\!>\!T_{c}. The absolute value of \lambda is obtained from the relation

\[\sigma_{sc}\ [\mu\kappa^{-1}]=4.83\times 10^{4}(1-h)[1+3.9(1-h)^{2}]^{1/2} \lambda^{-2}\ [{\rm nm}]\] (9)

(h\!=\!H/H_{c2} and H_{c2} is the second critical field), which describes the field variation in an ideal triangular vortex lattice. [20]

In separating P(B) in the signal from the superconductor and from the background by means of Gaussian functions by Eq. (4) a systematic error can occur. Part of the background signal may in fact be associated with the superconductor. [24] We can estimate this error on the assumption that the entire signal described by Eq. (3) or (4) refers to the superconductor. In this case, the second moment of the whole P(B) spectrum is systematically lower by 6.4% at B\!=\!0.1 T, 5.4% at B\!=\!0.5 T, 5.5% at B\!=\!1 T, and 10.1% at B\!=\!2.5 T. This may result to the systematic increase of \lambda by 3.2%-5%, respectively.

## III Experimental results and discussion

### Temperature dependence of \lambda

In Fig. 3 the temperature dependences of \sigma_{sc}\,\propto\!\lambda^{-2} for \mu_{0}H\!=\!0.1 T, 0.5 T, 1 T, and 2.5 T are shown. For \mu_{0}H = 1 T and 2.5 T, \sigma_{sc}(T) was measured down to 30 mK. It is seen that below 1.3 K (see inset in Fig. 3) \lambda^{-2}(\sigma_{sc}) is _temperature independent_. The experimental points are well fitted with \sigma_{sc}(T)\!=\!const. Note that the constant value of \lambda at low temperatures is predicted by the BCS model for weak-coupled superconductors. [26] The solid lines in Fig. 3 represent fit with the weak-coupling BCS model: [26]

\[\frac{\lambda^{-2}(T,\Delta_{0})}{\lambda^{-2}(0)}=1+2\int_{\Delta(T)}^{\infty }\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial E}\right)\!\frac{E}{\langle E^{2}-\Delta(T) ^{2}}dE.\] (10)

Here, f\!=\![1\!+\!\exp(E/k_{B}T)]^{-1} is the Fermi function, \Delta(T) =\Delta_{0}\bar{\Delta}(T/T_{c}) represents the temperature dependence of the energy gap, k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant, and \Delta_{0} is the zero-temperature value of the superconducting gap. For the normalized gap \bar{\Delta}(T/T_{c}) values tabulated in Ref. [27] were used. The data in Fig. 3 were fitted with \sigma_{sc}(0) and \Delta_{0} as free parameters, and T_{c} fixed from the corresponding field-cooled magnetization (M_{FC}) measurements. T_{c} was obtained from the intersection of the linearly extrapolated M_{FC}(T) curve in the vicinity of T_{c} with the M\!=\!0 line (see inset in Fig. 4). All the present results of \lambda(T) for RbOs_{2}O_{6} are summarized in Table 1.

In order to compare \lambda(T) obtained in different fields (0.1 T, 0.5 T, 1 T, and 2.5 T) the normalized superfluid densities \lambda^{-2}(T)/\lambda^{-2}(0)\!=\!\sigma(T)_{sc}/\sigma(0)_{sc} versus the reduced temperature T/T_{c} are plotted in Fig. 5. All \lambda(T) collapse almost on one curve, indicating that the temperature dependences of \lambda^{-2} measured at different fields are nearly the same. This is in contrast to unconventional superconductors, such as, e.g., cuprate high-temperature superconductors [18, 19, 28, 29] or the

Figure 3: Temperature dependence of \sigma_{sc}\,\propto\!\lambda^{-2} of RbOs_{2}O_{6}, measured in (from the top to the bottom) 0.1 T, 0.5 T, 1 T, and 2.5 T fields (field cooled). The inset shows the low-temperature region between 0 K and 1.25 K. The constant (within the error bars) \sigma_{sc}(T)\!\propto\!\lambda^{-2} suggests that RbOs_{2}O_{6} is a weak-coupled BCS superconductor. Lines represent fits with the expression for the weak-coupling BCS model given in Eq. (10).

  two-gap BCS-type MgB_{2} superconductor,[30] where the shape of the temperature dependence of \lambda^{-2} varies with magnetic field. In cuprates, for example, this behavior can be explained by the different type of symmetry of the wave function at the surface and in the bulk (see, e.g., Ref. [31]). In MgB_{2} the field dependence of \lambda is explained by the fast suppression of the \pi band by the magnetic field (see, e.g., Ref. [32]). Thus, the observation of nearly the same temperature dependences of \lambda measured in different fields is an additional argument pointing to the conventional character of superconductivity in RbOs_{2}O_{6}. One should mention, however, that close to the transition temperature T_{c}, points deviate from the theoretical BCS line (see Fig. 4). The increment of \lambda^{-2}(T) occurs at T/T_{c}\leq 1.1. This behavior was explained by the critical fluctuations that appear to be dominant in the vicinity of T_{c}.[33, 34] It was shown that in RbOs_{2}O_{6}, the transition from the normal to superconducting state occurs smoothly and \lambda^{-2}(T) has a tail (see Fig. 3 in Ref. [33]).

To summarize, in the whole temperature range (down to 30 mK) the temperature dependence of \lambda is consistent with what is expected for a weak-coupled s-wave BCS superconductor. The shape of \lambda(T) is almost independent on the magnetic field.

### Zero-temperature value of \lambda

To calculate the absolute value of \lambda(0) from \sigma_{sc}(0) one needs to know the zero-temperature value of the second critical field H_{c2}(0) [see Eq. (9)]. For this reason H_{c2}(T) was extracted from the M_{FC}(T) curves measured in constant magnetic fields ranging from 0.5 mT to 6 T (see Fig. 5). For each particular field H the corresponding T_{c}(H) was taken as the temperature where H=H_{c2}(T=T_{c}) (see inset in Fig. 5). H_{c2} depends almost linearly on T with some sign of saturation below 2.5 K. Note that a linear H_{c2}(T) behavior was also observed in Cd_{2}Re_{2}O_{7} (Refs. [2] and [35]) and recently in RbOs_{2}O_{6} (Refs. [5] and [7]) and in KOs_{2}O_{6} (Ref. [4]) pyrochlore superconductors. In the conventional BCS picture, H_{c2} is linear in T near T_{c0} [T_{c0}=T_{c}(H=0)] and saturates by approaching 0 K. The absolute value of H_{c2}(0) can be obtained by using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula[36] proposed for a weak-coupling superconductor: H_{c2}(0) =0.693(-dH_{c2}/dT)|_{T=T_{c0}}. The linear fit in the vicinity of T_{c0} yields d\mu_{0}H_{c2}/dT=-1.37(4)T/K and T_{c0}=6.32(19) K. The corresponding value of \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{WHH}(0) was found to be 6.00(25) T. The dashed line in Fig. 5 is the theoretical H_{c2}(T) curve obtained from the WHH model in the orbital limit.5 At high temperatures (above =3.5 K) the WHH line agrees rather well with the experimental data. However, at lower temperatures the experimental points no longer follow the WHH curve, suggesting that the actual value of H_{c2}(0) is slightly larger than H_{c2}^{WHH}(0). This deviation is probably a consequence of a nonspherical Fermi surface (see Ref. [37]). As was shown by Hohenberg and Werthamer[38] the zero-temperature value of H_{c2} for samples with nonspherical Fermi surfaces is always larger than H_{c2}^{WHH}(0). Thus, we take the H_{c2}^{WHH}(0) value as the lower limit for the zero-temperature value of the second critical field H_{c2}(0). An upper limit was set by a

Figure 4: H_{c2} vs T obtained from M_{FC}(T) measurements (see text for details). The dotted line is H_{c2}(T) obtained from the WHH model. The solid line is the fit with the power law H_{c2}(T)/H_{c2}(0) = 1 â€“(T/T_{c0})^{n} with the parameters listed in the text. The inset shows M_{FC} vs T dependences after substraction of the small paramagnetic background: from the left to the right \mu_{0}H=4.6 T, 3.4 T, 2.2 T, 1 T, and 0.01 T.

  power-law fit H_{c2}(T)/H_{c2}(0) = 1 - (_T_/_T_c0)_n_ (solid line), which gives an exponent n = 1.17(5), T_{0} = 6.33(1) K, and _m_OH_r_c2(0) = 7.25(19) T. The values of l(0) calculated with _H__c2(0) obtained from the WHH model and from the fit with the power law are summarized in Table 1. Finaly, the representative range for l(0) in RbOs2O6 obtained from the _m_SR experiments is 250-300 nm, in agreement with the low-field magnetization measurements.13

The value of the first critical field H_{1} was estimated from the Ginzburg-Landau equation

\[H_{c1}(0) = \frac{\Phi_{0}}{4\pi\lambda^{2}(0)}\ln\,\kappa(0),\]

where Ph0 is the magnetic flux quantum, k = _l_/_x__GL_ is the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, and x_{L} is the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length. Using the measured value l(0) = 250-300 nm and x_{L}(0) = 7.4 nm taken from Ref. 5, we can estimate _m_OH_r_c1= 6.8-9.3 mT, in agreement with _m_OH_r_c1 = 9.2 mT obtained by Bruhwiller _et al._ in Ref. 39 from specific heat measurements.

### Field dependence of l

It is now well established that not only the temperature behavior, but also the field dependence of l is completely different for conventional BCS-type and unconventional superconductors.11,18 By analyzing l(_H_) in different superconducting materials, it was concluded that in superconductors associated with an anisotropic energy gap l increases almost linearly with the field.11 This effect was explained by the Doppler shift of the quasiparticles momentum in the gap nodes.11,18 It was also shown that in unconventional superconductors the slope

\[\eta = \frac{{\rm d}[\lambda(h)/\lambda(0)]}{dh}\]

(_h_ = _H_/_H__c2_) lies in a range of 1-6, while it is close to zero for superconductors with the isotropic energy gap.11

In order to obtain the field dependence of l, s_{c} was measured as a function of the magnetic field (see Fig. 6). Each point was obtained by field-cooling the sample from a temperature well above T_{c} to 1.6 K. The value of s_{c} (_H_, 1.6 K) increases almost linearly up to 75 mT, goes through a pronounced maximum around 0.1 T, and then starts to decrease from 1.65 _m_s-1 at the peak position to 0.67 _m_s-1 at 2.5 T. The solid line is the theoretical s_{c}(_H_) dependence obtained by means of Eq. (9) with _m_OH_r_c2(1.6 K) = 5.80 (2)T [taken from the _H__c2(_T_) curve given in Fig. 5], and the field independent l(1.6 K) = 262 nm. Above <=0.2 T there is quite a good agreement between theory and experimental data. The deviations at lower fields are most probably determined by the distortion of the vortex lattice induced by pinning. A similar peak (followed by a plateau at high fields) is usually observed in high-temperature superconductors.40,41

The inset in Fig. 6 shows l vs h for _m_OH_r_ > 0.2 T at T = 1.6 K. A linear fit yields _e_(1.6 K) = -0.10(5). The observation of a small e suggests that RbOs2O6 is a superconductor with an isotropic energy gap (see, e.g., Ref. 11).

We also performed additional l vs H experiments based on magnetization measurements. Following Kogan _et al._42 l can be obtained from the equilibrium magnetization M_{q} from the relation

\[\lambda^{- 2} \propto \frac{dM_{eq}}{d\ln H}\]

(M_{q} is the magnetization of the superconductor without pinning). This is the consequence of the London equation predicting that in type-II superconductors with zero pinning, the magnetization is proportional to l-2ln H. Note that Eq. (12) is valid only in the intermediate field region H_{1}  H  H  H  H  t2 (here H_{1} is the first critical field).26 To avoid the "pinning" problem, M_{q}(_H_) was taken from field-cooled measurements, M_{q}(_T_,_H_) = M_{C}(_T_,_H_) (see inset in Fig. 7). As shown above in our sample, pinning (maximum in Fig. 6) is suppressed at fields above <=0.2 T. The l vs H dependence, reconstructed by means of Eq. (12) and using the values of M_{q}(_H_) at T = 1.75 K, is shown in Fig. 7. Because it is not possible to

The solid line is obtained from Eq. (9) with the parameters written in the text. The inset shows l(1.6 K) as a function of h = _H_/_H__c2_.

  calculate the absolute value of l from Eq. (12), data in Fig. 7 are scaled to the _m_SR value of l(1.75 K) at m0_H_ = 1 T. It is seen that between 0.6 T and 4.8 T the l vs H dependence is almost flat. A linear fit of the data in this field range yields a slope e = -0.07(2), in agreement with the e value obtained from the _m_SR experiment.

To summarize, the magnetic penetration depth l measured at low temperatures was found to be almost (within the accuracy of 10%) _field independent_. This suggests that the superconducting energy gap in RbOs2O6 is _isotropic_.

Dependence of the zero-temperature superconducting gap _D_th on the critical temperature and the magnetic field

Bearing in mind that the critical temperature T_{c} is a function of the applied magnetic field, in Fig. 8 the zero-temperature superconducting gap _D_th [obtained from fits of the l-2(_T_) data shown in Fig. 3] is plotted as a function of T_{c}. In addition we also include in this graph the value _D_th(0.5 mT) = 1.02(2)meV obtained from the magnetization measurements.[13] The solid line represents the linear fit with the ratio 2_D_th/_kBT__c_ = 3.47(10), which is close to the weak-coupling BCS value of 3.52. However, at high and low temperatures the data systematically deviate from the simple BCS line, suggesting that the ratio 2_D_th/_kBT__c_ is field dependent as demonstrated in Fig. 9. It is worth noting that for conventional bulk superconductors the ratio 2_D_th/_kBT__c_ is field independent, while in thin films and in granular materials the dependence is quite strong.[26] For the thin films of Sn, Pb, and In.[43, 44] it was experimentally observed that at low temperatures the magnetic field dependence of the BCS ratio follows the empirical relation

\[\frac{2\Delta_{0}(H)}{k_{B}T_{c}(H)} = \frac{2\Delta_{0}(0)}{k_{B}T_{c}(0)}\lbrack1-(H/H_{c2})^{2}\rbrack,\]

where 2_D_th(0)/_kBT__c_(0) is the BCS ratio at zero field. The shadowed region in Fig. 9 represents the results of calculations by means of Eq. (13) with 2D_th(0)/_kBT__c_(0) = 3.47 and assuming that _H_c2(0) lies between the values obtained from the WHH model and from the fit with the power law (see Sec. III B). The field dependence of the energy gap may be explained if one assumes that the electrons moving close to the surface contribute less to the pairing energy.[45] This may result in a decrease of the energy gap with increasing the magnetic field.

To summarize, the ratio 2D_th/_kBT__c_ is found in the range of 3.09-3.60 close to the weak-coupling BCS value of 3.52. The field dependence of this ratio can be explained by the finite size of the individual grains of the sample.

## IV Conclusions

Muon-spin-rotation and magnetization studies were performed on the pyrochlore superconductor RbOs2O6. The main conclusions are the following: (i) The absolute value of l at zero temperature obtained from _m_SR experiments is in the range from 250 nm to 300 nm. (ii) In the temperature region down to 30 mK the temperature dependence of l is consistent with what is expected for a weak-coupled _s_-wave BCS superconductor. (iii) The shape of l(_T_) is almost independent of the magnetic field. (iv) The value of the zero-temperature superconducting gap decreases with increasing magnetic field (decreasing of T_{c}). The ratio 2D_th/_kBT__c_ was found to be in the range of 3.09-3.60, close to the weak-coupling BCS value of 3.52. (v) The _m_SR and the equilibrium magnetization measurements both show that at low temperatures the magnetic penetration depth l is almost (within the accuracy of 10%) field independent, in agreement with what is expected for a superconductor with an isotropic energy gap. To conclude, all of the above-mentioned features suggest that RbOs2O6 is _a weak-coupled BCS superconductor with an isotropic energy gap_.

###### Abstract

Measurements of the magnetic field penetration depth \lambda in the pyrochlore superconductor RbOs_{2}O_{6} (T_{c} = 6.3 K) were carried out by means of the muon-spin-rotation (\muSR) technique. At low temperatures \lambda^{-2}(T) saturates and becomes constant below T = 0.2T_{c}, in agreement with what is expected for weak-coupled s-wave BCS superconductors. The value of \lambda at T = 0 was found to be in the range of 250-300 nm. \muSR and equilibrium magnetization measurements both reveal that at low temperatures \lambda is almost (at the level of 10%) independent of the applied magnetic field. This result suggests that the superconducting energy gap in RbOs_{2}O_{6} is isotropic.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in pyrochlore-related oxides has attracted considerable interest in the study of these materials.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] However, until now there has been no agreement about the nature of the superconducting pairing mechanism in these compounds. On the one hand, based on the results of the specific heat,[9] nuclear quadrupole resonance[10] (NQR), and muon-spin rotation[11, 12] (\muSR) experiments, Cd_{2}Re_{2}O_{7} is suggested to be a weak-coupled isotropic BCS superconductor. The specific heat,[5] pressure effect on the magnetic field penetration depth,[13] and nuclear magnetic resonance[14] (NMR) measurements of RbOs_{2}O_{6} and the band structure calculations of KOs_{2}O_{6} (Ref. [15]) also point to the conventional type of superconductivity. On the other hand, second critical field H_{c2},[4]\muSR,[16] and specific heat[4] experiments in KOs_{2}O_{6}, as well as H_{c2} measurements in RbOs_{2}O_{6} (Ref. [7]), specific heat experiments in RbOs_{2}O_{6} and CsOs_{2}O_{6} (Ref. [17]), suggest an unconventional type of pairing.

The magnetic field penetration depth \lambda is one of the fundamental lengths of a superconductor. The temperature dependence \lambda(T) reflects the quasiparticle density of states available for thermal excitations and therefore probes the superconducting gap structure. The shape of \lambda(T) and the zero-temperature value \lambda(0) provide information about the superconducting mechanism and set a length scale for the screening of an external magnetic field. In addition, the field dependence of \lambda at low temperatures may reflect the anisotropy of the superconducting energy gap.[11, 18] In this paper, we report on magnetic field penetration depth measurements down to 30 mK in RbOs_{2}O_{6} by means of the transverse-field muon-spin-rotation (TF-\muSR) technique (see, e.g., Ref. [19]). The temperature dependence of \lambda^{-2} saturates at low temperatures and becomes constant below T = 0.2T_{c}. This behavior agrees with what is expected for weak-coupled s-wave BCS superconductors. Measurements of the magnetic field dependence of \lambda by means of TF-\muSR and magnetization reveal that at low temperatures \lambda is almost field independent. This result suggests that the superconducting energy gap in RbOs_{2}O_{6} is isotropic. The ratio 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c} was found to be in the range of 3.09-3.60, which is close to the weak-coupling BCS value of 3.52.

The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we describe the sample preparation procedure and the TF-\muSR technique as a tool to measure the magnetic field penetration depth \lambda. Section III A comprises studies of the temperature dependence of \lambda. In Secs. III B and III C we discuss the calculation of the absolute value of \lambda and its magnetic field dependence. In Sec. III D results of the dependence of the zero-temperature superconducting gap \Delta_{0} on the superconducting critical temperature and the magnetic field are reported. The conclusions follow in Sec. IV.

## II Sample preparation and experimental techniques

### Sample preparation

Polycrystalline samples of RbOs_{2}O_{6} were synthesized by a procedure similar to that described in Refs. [3, 5, and 6]. A stoichiometric amount of OsO_{2} (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%) and Rb_{2}O (Aldrich, 99%) was thoroughly mixed in an argon-filled dry box and pressed into pellets. The pellets were put to a quartz tube which was evacuated and sealed. The tube was heated up to 600 ^{\circ}C and kept at this temperature for 24 h. According to the x-ray analysis, the resulting sample contained two phases: namely, pyrochlore RbOs_{2}O_{6} and RbOsO_{4}. RbOsO_{4} was removed after 2 h etching in a 10% solution of HCl and subsequent washing with water and drying at 100 ^{\circ}C. The x-ray diffraction pattern of the post-treated sample is shown in Fig. 1 where all reflections can be indexed on the basis of the pyrochlore cell with a lattice parameter a = 10.1137 (1)A.

 

## B. Tf-\muSr

The \muSR experiments were performed at the \piM3 beamline at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Villigen, Switzerland). The sample was field cooled from above T_{c} to 30 mK in fields of 2.5 T and 1 T and to \approx1.6 K in a series of fields ranging from 5 mT to 0.6 T. We used the transverse field \muSR to probe the local magnetic field distribution P(B) inside the superconducting sample in the mixed state. The second moment of P(B) is connected directly with the magnetic field penetration depth \lambda.[20]

The \muSR signal was observed in the usual time-differential way by monitoring the positron rate from the \mu^{+} decay as a function of the elapsed \mu^{+} lifetime in the positron telescopes. The time dependence of the positron rate is given by the expression[21]

\[\frac{dN}{dt}=N_{0}\frac{1}{\tau_{\mu}}e^{-t/\tau_{\mu}}[1+aP(t)]+bg,\] (1)

where N_{0} is a normalization constant, bg is a time-independent background, \tau_{\mu}=2.197 03(4) \times 10^{-6} s is the \mu^{+} lifetime, a is the maximum decay asymmetry for the particular detector telescope (a\sim 0.18 in our case), and P(t) is the spin polarization of the muon ensemble:

\[P(t)=\int P(B)\cos(\gamma_{\mu}Bt+\phi)dB.\] (2)

Here P(B) is the field distribution inside a sample, \gamma_{\mu}=2 \pi\times 135.5342 MHz/T is the muon gyromagnetic ratio, and \phi is the angle between the initial muon polarization and the effective symmetry axis of a positron detector. To link P(t) and P(B) one can use the algorithm of fast Fourier transform or the direct least-squares fit of P(t) by the sum of precessions in discrete fields:[22]

\[P(t)=\sum_{i}A_{i}\cos(\gamma_{\mu}B_{i}t+\phi),\] (3)

where A_{i} are varied and B_{i} are fixed with spacing \Delta B\approx\pi/(\gamma_{\mu}I_{\rm max}); t_{\rm max}\sim 10^{-5} s is the time window of the \muSR technique.

Magnetic field distributions inside the RbOs_{2}O_{6} sample in the normal (7.5 K) and the mixed (1.55 K) states after field cooling in a magnetic field of 0.5 T obtained by the procedure (3) are shown in Fig. 2. In the normal state, a single line at the position of the external magnetic field with broadening arising from the nuclear magnetic moments is seen. Below T_{c} the field distribution is broadened and asymmetric. For a better visualization, the fit of P(B) by three Gaussian lines is represented by dotted lines in Fig. 2. Two wide lines with the mean frequencies below the external field are used to describe the asymmetric line shape in the superconducting part of the sample. The narrow line seen at a field a little bit above the external field suggests that part of the sample is in a normal state. The slight shift of this line to the higher fields is associated with the diamagnetism of the superconducting grains. It leads to an increase of the local field in the nonsuperconducting parts of the sample. This behavior is often observed in samples with less than 100% superconducting volume fraction.[16, 23] The superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be \simeq70%, close to the specific heat measurements[5] performed on a similarly synthesized sample where the superconducting fraction was estimated about 80%.

To obtain the second moment of the asymmetric field distribution in the superconducting state we used the procedure similar to Refs. 24 and 25. All the \muSR spectra taken at

Figure 2: Typical internal field distributions measured by the \muSR technique inside the RbOs_{2}O_{6} sample above (a) and below (b) T_{c} after field cooling in a magnetic field of 0.5 T. Below T_{c} the field distribution is broadened and asymmetric. The lines represent the best fit with Gaussian line shapes. See text for details.

 <\!0.85T_{c} where the three lines are resolved were analyzed by fitting a three-component expression to the P(t) data:

\[P(t) = A_{b}\exp(-\ \sigma_{b}^{2}t^{2}/2)\cos(\gamma_{\mu}B_{b}t+\phi)\] (4) \[+\sum_{i=1}^{2}A_{i}\exp(-\ \sigma_{i}^{2}t^{2}/2)\cos(\gamma_{\mu}B_{i}t+\phi).\]

The first term with small \sigma_{b}<\!0.3 MHz and B_{b} close to the applied field corresponds to the background muons stopping in parts of the cryostat and in the nonsuperconducting parts of the sample. The sum corresponds to the asymmetric field distribution inside the superconductor. At 0.85T_{c}\!<\!T\!<\!T_{c} the two broad lines (see, e.g, Fig. 2) responsible for superconducting state merge with each other and the analysis is statistically correct for one superconducting signal. At T\!\!>\!T_{c} the analysis is simplified to the background term only with \sigma_{b}\!=\!\sigma_{nm}\!\sim\!0.1 MHz resulting from the nuclear moments of the sample.

The superconducting term in Eq. (4) is equivalent to the field distribution

\[P(B)=\gamma_{\mu}\sum_{i=1}^{2}\frac{A_{i}}{\sigma_{i}}\exp\left(-\frac{\gamma _{\mu}^{2}(B-B_{i})^{2}}{2\sigma_{i}^{2}}\right).\] (5)

For this distribution the mean field and second moment are [24, 25]

\[\langle B\rangle=\sum_{i=1}^{2}\frac{A_{i}B_{i}}{A_{1}+A_{2}}\] (6)

and

\[\langle\Delta B^{2}\rangle=\sum_{i=1}^{2}\frac{A_{i}}{A_{1}+A_{2}}[(\sigma/ \gamma_{\mu})^{2}-[B_{i}-\langle B\rangle]^{2}].\] (7)

The extracted second moment of the magnetic field distribution of the vortex lattice can be expressed in frequency units

\[\sigma_{sc}=[\gamma_{\mu}^{2}\langle\Delta B^{2}\rangle-\sigma_{nm}^{2}]^{1/2},\] (8)

where \sigma_{nm} is the additional broadening due to the nuclear moments measured at T\!\!>\!T_{c}. The absolute value of \lambda is obtained from the relation

\[\sigma_{sc}\ [\mu\kappa^{-1}]=4.83\times 10^{4}(1-h)[1+3.9(1-h)^{2}]^{1/2} \lambda^{-2}\ [{\rm nm}]\] (9)

(h\!=\!H/H_{c2} and H_{c2} is the second critical field), which describes the field variation in an ideal triangular vortex lattice. [20]

In separating P(B) in the signal from the superconductor and from the background by means of Gaussian functions by Eq. (4) a systematic error can occur. Part of the background signal may in fact be associated with the superconductor. [24] We can estimate this error on the assumption that the entire signal described by Eq. (3) or (4) refers to the superconductor. In this case, the second moment of the whole P(B) spectrum is systematically lower by 6.4% at B\!=\!0.1 T, 5.4% at B\!=\!0.5 T, 5.5% at B\!=\!1 T, and 10.1% at B\!=\!2.5 T. This may result to the systematic increase of \lambda by 3.2%-5%, respectively.

## III Experimental results and discussion

### Temperature dependence of \lambda

In Fig. 3 the temperature dependences of \sigma_{sc}\,\propto\!\lambda^{-2} for \mu_{0}H\!=\!0.1 T, 0.5 T, 1 T, and 2.5 T are shown. For \mu_{0}H = 1 T and 2.5 T, \sigma_{sc}(T) was measured down to 30 mK. It is seen that below 1.3 K (see inset in Fig. 3) \lambda^{-2}(\sigma_{sc}) is _temperature independent_. The experimental points are well fitted with \sigma_{sc}(T)\!=\!const. Note that the constant value of \lambda at low temperatures is predicted by the BCS model for weak-coupled superconductors. [26] The solid lines in Fig. 3 represent fit with the weak-coupling BCS model: [26]

\[\frac{\lambda^{-2}(T,\Delta_{0})}{\lambda^{-2}(0)}=1+2\int_{\Delta(T)}^{\infty }\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial E}\right)\!\frac{E}{\langle E^{2}-\Delta(T) ^{2}}dE.\] (10)

Here, f\!=\![1\!+\!\exp(E/k_{B}T)]^{-1} is the Fermi function, \Delta(T) =\Delta_{0}\bar{\Delta}(T/T_{c}) represents the temperature dependence of the energy gap, k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant, and \Delta_{0} is the zero-temperature value of the superconducting gap. For the normalized gap \bar{\Delta}(T/T_{c}) values tabulated in Ref. [27] were used. The data in Fig. 3 were fitted with \sigma_{sc}(0) and \Delta_{0} as free parameters, and T_{c} fixed from the corresponding field-cooled magnetization (M_{FC}) measurements. T_{c} was obtained from the intersection of the linearly extrapolated M_{FC}(T) curve in the vicinity of T_{c} with the M\!=\!0 line (see inset in Fig. 4). All the present results of \lambda(T) for RbOs_{2}O_{6} are summarized in Table 1.

In order to compare \lambda(T) obtained in different fields (0.1 T, 0.5 T, 1 T, and 2.5 T) the normalized superfluid densities \lambda^{-2}(T)/\lambda^{-2}(0)\!=\!\sigma(T)_{sc}/\sigma(0)_{sc} versus the reduced temperature T/T_{c} are plotted in Fig. 5. All \lambda(T) collapse almost on one curve, indicating that the temperature dependences of \lambda^{-2} measured at different fields are nearly the same. This is in contrast to unconventional superconductors, such as, e.g., cuprate high-temperature superconductors [18, 19, 28, 29] or the

Figure 3: Temperature dependence of \sigma_{sc}\,\propto\!\lambda^{-2} of RbOs_{2}O_{6}, measured in (from the top to the bottom) 0.1 T, 0.5 T, 1 T, and 2.5 T fields (field cooled). The inset shows the low-temperature region between 0 K and 1.25 K. The constant (within the error bars) \sigma_{sc}(T)\!\propto\!\lambda^{-2} suggests that RbOs_{2}O_{6} is a weak-coupled BCS superconductor. Lines represent fits with the expression for the weak-coupling BCS model given in Eq. (10).

  two-gap BCS-type MgB_{2} superconductor,[30] where the shape of the temperature dependence of \lambda^{-2} varies with magnetic field. In cuprates, for example, this behavior can be explained by the different type of symmetry of the wave function at the surface and in the bulk (see, e.g., Ref. [31]). In MgB_{2} the field dependence of \lambda is explained by the fast suppression of the \pi band by the magnetic field (see, e.g., Ref. [32]). Thus, the observation of nearly the same temperature dependences of \lambda measured in different fields is an additional argument pointing to the conventional character of superconductivity in RbOs_{2}O_{6}. One should mention, however, that close to the transition temperature T_{c}, points deviate from the theoretical BCS line (see Fig. 4). The increment of \lambda^{-2}(T) occurs at T/T_{c}\leq 1.1. This behavior was explained by the critical fluctuations that appear to be dominant in the vicinity of T_{c}.[33, 34] It was shown that in RbOs_{2}O_{6}, the transition from the normal to superconducting state occurs smoothly and \lambda^{-2}(T) has a tail (see Fig. 3 in Ref. [33]).

To summarize, in the whole temperature range (down to 30 mK) the temperature dependence of \lambda is consistent with what is expected for a weak-coupled s-wave BCS superconductor. The shape of \lambda(T) is almost independent on the magnetic field.

### Zero-temperature value of \lambda

To calculate the absolute value of \lambda(0) from \sigma_{sc}(0) one needs to know the zero-temperature value of the second critical field H_{c2}(0) [see Eq. (9)]. For this reason H_{c2}(T) was extracted from the M_{FC}(T) curves measured in constant magnetic fields ranging from 0.5 mT to 6 T (see Fig. 5). For each particular field H the corresponding T_{c}(H) was taken as the temperature where H=H_{c2}(T=T_{c}) (see inset in Fig. 5). H_{c2} depends almost linearly on T with some sign of saturation below 2.5 K. Note that a linear H_{c2}(T) behavior was also observed in Cd_{2}Re_{2}O_{7} (Refs. [2] and [35]) and recently in RbOs_{2}O_{6} (Refs. [5] and [7]) and in KOs_{2}O_{6} (Ref. [4]) pyrochlore superconductors. In the conventional BCS picture, H_{c2} is linear in T near T_{c0} [T_{c0}=T_{c}(H=0)] and saturates by approaching 0 K. The absolute value of H_{c2}(0) can be obtained by using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula[36] proposed for a weak-coupling superconductor: H_{c2}(0) =0.693(-dH_{c2}/dT)|_{T=T_{c0}}. The linear fit in the vicinity of T_{c0} yields d\mu_{0}H_{c2}/dT=-1.37(4)T/K and T_{c0}=6.32(19) K. The corresponding value of \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{WHH}(0) was found to be 6.00(25) T. The dashed line in Fig. 5 is the theoretical H_{c2}(T) curve obtained from the WHH model in the orbital limit.5 At high temperatures (above =3.5 K) the WHH line agrees rather well with the experimental data. However, at lower temperatures the experimental points no longer follow the WHH curve, suggesting that the actual value of H_{c2}(0) is slightly larger than H_{c2}^{WHH}(0). This deviation is probably a consequence of a nonspherical Fermi surface (see Ref. [37]). As was shown by Hohenberg and Werthamer[38] the zero-temperature value of H_{c2} for samples with nonspherical Fermi surfaces is always larger than H_{c2}^{WHH}(0). Thus, we take the H_{c2}^{WHH}(0) value as the lower limit for the zero-temperature value of the second critical field H_{c2}(0). An upper limit was set by a

Figure 4: H_{c2} vs T obtained from M_{FC}(T) measurements (see text for details). The dotted line is H_{c2}(T) obtained from the WHH model. The solid line is the fit with the power law H_{c2}(T)/H_{c2}(0) = 1 â€“(T/T_{c0})^{n} with the parameters listed in the text. The inset shows M_{FC} vs T dependences after substraction of the small paramagnetic background: from the left to the right \mu_{0}H=4.6 T, 3.4 T, 2.2 T, 1 T, and 0.01 T.

  power-law fit H_{c2}(T)/H_{c2}(0) = 1 - (_T_/_T_c0)_n_ (solid line), which gives an exponent n = 1.17(5), T_{0} = 6.33(1) K, and _m_OH_r_c2(0) = 7.25(19) T. The values of l(0) calculated with _H__c2(0) obtained from the WHH model and from the fit with the power law are summarized in Table 1. Finaly, the representative range for l(0) in RbOs2O6 obtained from the _m_SR experiments is 250-300 nm, in agreement with the low-field magnetization measurements.13

The value of the first critical field H_{1} was estimated from the Ginzburg-Landau equation

\[H_{c1}(0) = \frac{\Phi_{0}}{4\pi\lambda^{2}(0)}\ln\,\kappa(0),\]

where Ph0 is the magnetic flux quantum, k = _l_/_x__GL_ is the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, and x_{L} is the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length. Using the measured value l(0) = 250-300 nm and x_{L}(0) = 7.4 nm taken from Ref. 5, we can estimate _m_OH_r_c1= 6.8-9.3 mT, in agreement with _m_OH_r_c1 = 9.2 mT obtained by Bruhwiller _et al._ in Ref. 39 from specific heat measurements.

### Field dependence of l

It is now well established that not only the temperature behavior, but also the field dependence of l is completely different for conventional BCS-type and unconventional superconductors.11,18 By analyzing l(_H_) in different superconducting materials, it was concluded that in superconductors associated with an anisotropic energy gap l increases almost linearly with the field.11 This effect was explained by the Doppler shift of the quasiparticles momentum in the gap nodes.11,18 It was also shown that in unconventional superconductors the slope

\[\eta = \frac{{\rm d}[\lambda(h)/\lambda(0)]}{dh}\]

(_h_ = _H_/_H__c2_) lies in a range of 1-6, while it is close to zero for superconductors with the isotropic energy gap.11

In order to obtain the field dependence of l, s_{c} was measured as a function of the magnetic field (see Fig. 6). Each point was obtained by field-cooling the sample from a temperature well above T_{c} to 1.6 K. The value of s_{c} (_H_, 1.6 K) increases almost linearly up to 75 mT, goes through a pronounced maximum around 0.1 T, and then starts to decrease from 1.65 _m_s-1 at the peak position to 0.67 _m_s-1 at 2.5 T. The solid line is the theoretical s_{c}(_H_) dependence obtained by means of Eq. (9) with _m_OH_r_c2(1.6 K) = 5.80 (2)T [taken from the _H__c2(_T_) curve given in Fig. 5], and the field independent l(1.6 K) = 262 nm. Above <=0.2 T there is quite a good agreement between theory and experimental data. The deviations at lower fields are most probably determined by the distortion of the vortex lattice induced by pinning. A similar peak (followed by a plateau at high fields) is usually observed in high-temperature superconductors.40,41

The inset in Fig. 6 shows l vs h for _m_OH_r_ > 0.2 T at T = 1.6 K. A linear fit yields _e_(1.6 K) = -0.10(5). The observation of a small e suggests that RbOs2O6 is a superconductor with an isotropic energy gap (see, e.g., Ref. 11).

We also performed additional l vs H experiments based on magnetization measurements. Following Kogan _et al._42 l can be obtained from the equilibrium magnetization M_{q} from the relation

\[\lambda^{- 2} \propto \frac{dM_{eq}}{d\ln H}\]

(M_{q} is the magnetization of the superconductor without pinning). This is the consequence of the London equation predicting that in type-II superconductors with zero pinning, the magnetization is proportional to l-2ln H. Note that Eq. (12) is valid only in the intermediate field region H_{1}  H  H  H  H  t2 (here H_{1} is the first critical field).26 To avoid the "pinning" problem, M_{q}(_H_) was taken from field-cooled measurements, M_{q}(_T_,_H_) = M_{C}(_T_,_H_) (see inset in Fig. 7). As shown above in our sample, pinning (maximum in Fig. 6) is suppressed at fields above <=0.2 T. The l vs H dependence, reconstructed by means of Eq. (12) and using the values of M_{q}(_H_) at T = 1.75 K, is shown in Fig. 7. Because it is not possible to

Figure 6: Magnetic field dependence of _Ïƒsc_ for RbOs2O6 measured at T = 1.6 K. Each point was obtained after field-cooling the sample from a temperature above T_{c}. The solid line is obtained from Eq. (9) with the parameters written in the text. The inset shows l(1.6 K) as a function of h = _H_/_H__c2_.

  calculate the absolute value of l from Eq. (12), data in Fig. 7 are scaled to the _m_SR value of l(1.75 K) at m0_H_ = 1 T. It is seen that between 0.6 T and 4.8 T the l vs H dependence is almost flat. A linear fit of the data in this field range yields a slope e = -0.07(2), in agreement with the e value obtained from the _m_SR experiment.

To summarize, the magnetic penetration depth l measured at low temperatures was found to be almost (within the accuracy of 10%) _field independent_. This suggests that the superconducting energy gap in RbOs2O6 is _isotropic_.

Dependence of the zero-temperature superconducting gap _D_th on the critical temperature and the magnetic field

Bearing in mind that the critical temperature T_{c} is a function of the applied magnetic field, in Fig. 8 the zero-temperature superconducting gap _D_th [obtained from fits of the l-2(_T_) data shown in Fig. 3] is plotted as a function of T_{c}. In addition we also include in this graph the value _D_th(0.5 mT) = 1.02(2)meV obtained from the magnetization measurements.[13] The solid line represents the linear fit with the ratio 2_D_th/_kBT__c_ = 3.47(10), which is close to the weak-coupling BCS value of 3.52. However, at high and low temperatures the data systematically deviate from the simple BCS line, suggesting that the ratio 2_D_th/_kBT__c_ is field dependent as demonstrated in Fig. 9. It is worth noting that for conventional bulk superconductors the ratio 2_D_th/_kBT__c_ is field independent, while in thin films and in granular materials the dependence is quite strong.[26] For the thin films of Sn, Pb, and In.[43, 44] it was experimentally observed that at low temperatures the magnetic field dependence of the BCS ratio follows the empirical relation

\[\frac{2\Delta_{0}(H)}{k_{B}T_{c}(H)} = \frac{2\Delta_{0}(0)}{k_{B}T_{c}(0)}\lbrack1-(H/H_{c2})^{2}\rbrack,\]

where 2_D_th(0)/_kBT__c_(0) is the BCS ratio at zero field. The shadowed region in Fig. 9 represents the results of calculations by means of Eq. (13) with 2D_th(0)/_kBT__c_(0) = 3.47 and assuming that _H_c2(0) lies between the values obtained from the WHH model and from the fit with the power law (see Sec. III B). The field dependence of the energy gap may be explained if one assumes that the electrons moving close to the surface contribute less to the pairing energy.[45] This may result in a decrease of the energy gap with increasing the magnetic field.

To summarize, the ratio 2D_th/_kBT__c_ is found in the range of 3.09-3.60 close to the weak-coupling BCS value of 3.52. The field dependence of this ratio can be explained by the finite size of the individual grains of the sample.

## IV Conclusions

Muon-spin-rotation and magnetization studies were performed on the pyrochlore superconductor RbOs2O6. The main conclusions are the following: (i) The absolute value of l at zero temperature obtained from _m_SR experiments is in the range from 250 nm to 300 nm. (ii) In the temperature region down to 30 mK the temperature dependence of l is consistent with what is expected for a weak-coupled _s_-wave BCS superconductor. (iii) The shape of l(_T_) is almost independent of the magnetic field. (iv) The value of the zero-temperature superconducting gap decreases with increasing magnetic field (decreasing of T_{c}). The ratio 2D_th/_kBT__c_ was found to be in the range of 3.09-3.60, close to the weak-coupling BCS value of 3.52. (v) The _m_SR and the equilibrium magnetization measurements both show that at low temperatures the magnetic penetration depth l is almost (within the accuracy of 10%) field independent, in agreement with what is expected for a superconductor with an isotropic energy gap. To conclude, all of the above-mentioned features suggest that RbOs2O6 is _a weak-coupled BCS superconductor with an isotropic energy gap_.
