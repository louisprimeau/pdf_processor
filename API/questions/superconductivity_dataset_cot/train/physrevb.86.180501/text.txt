###### Abstract

We report \({}^{75}\)As nuclear magnetic resonance studies on an underdoped single-crystal Ba\({}_{0.77}\)K\({}_{0.23}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) with \(T_{\rm c}\) = 16.5 K. Below \(T_{\rm N}\) = 46 K, the NMR peaks for \(H\parallel c\) split and those for \(H\parallel a\) shift to higher frequencies, which indicates that an internal magnetic field along the \(c\) axis develops below \(T_{\rm N}\). The spin-lattice relaxation rate \(1/T_{1}\) measured at the shifted peak with \(H\parallel a\), which experiences the internal field, shows a distinct decrease below \(T_{\rm c}\)(\(\mu_{0}H\) = 12 T) = 16 K, following a \(T^{3}\) relation at low temperatures. Our results show unambiguously that antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity coexist microscopically. The unusual superconducting state with the coexisting magnetism is highlighted.

  points shown by the symbol \(\boxtimes\) are adapted from Ref. [22] for polycrystals, and the open squares are from Ref. [23] for single crystals. \(T_{N}\) for our \(x=0\) sample determined from resistivity [19] agrees well with Ref. [23]. The solid circles indicate \(T_{c}\) determined from susceptibility measurements. The samples with \(x=0.23\) and \(0.24\) belong to the underdoped regime.

Figure 2 shows the frequency-scanned \({}^{75}\)As NMR spectra for Ba\({}_{0.77}\)K\({}_{0.23}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) with both \(H\parallel c\)-axis and \(H\parallel a\)-axis configurations. The spectrum at \(T=100\) K in the paramagnetic state shows a sharp central peak accompanied by two satellite peaks due to a nuclear quadrupole interaction. The nuclear quadrupole frequency \(\nu_{\rm{Q}}\) is found to be \(5.06\) MHz, which is a little smaller than the optimal doped sample (\(5.1\) MHz). [20] The spectra change below \(T_{\rm{N}}=46\) K. Namely, all three peaks split for \(H\parallel c\), while the peaks shifted to higher frequencies for \(H\parallel a\). In the antiferromagnetically ordered state, neutron experiments have found that Fe magnetic moments lie on the \(ab\) plane, forming stripes. [24] The internal magnetic field at the As site located above or below the magnetically ordered Fe layer should direct along the \(c\) axis or antiparallel to the \(c\) axis. In such a case, for \(H\parallel c\), the effective field seen by the As nuclei sitting above or below the Fe layer is \(H_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{eff}}=H_{0}\pm H_{\rm{int}}\), which will split the spectra into two sets. One set consisting of the central transition and two satellites shifted up by the amount of \(\gamma H_{\rm{int}}\), which corresponds to the As sitting above the Fe layer, and the other set corresponding to the As sitting below the Fe layer shifted down by the same amount. For \(H\parallel a\), on the other hand, \(H_{\rm{at}}^{\rm{eff}}=\sqrt{H_{0}^{2}+H_{\rm{int}}^{2}}\) will simply shift each peak to a higher resonance frequency. [25, 26] The spectra shown in Fig. 2 show that the As nuclei indeed experience such internal magnetic fields below \(T_{\rm{N}}=46\) K. The same is true for the \(x=0.24\) sample (data not shown).

As seen in Fig. 2(a), for \(H\parallel c\), the two sets of the spectra happen to overlap with each other, resulting in five peaks, of which the central one is the broadest. The solid curve is the simulation of the summation of the two sets of the spectra. In the calculation, the area ratio of a satellite peak to the central peak is set to 3:4 according to the theoretical requirement, which is indeed satisfied at \(T=100\) K. Such a calculation fits the spectra very well below \(T=35\) K, indicating that the whole sample is in the antiferromagnetically ordered state below this temperature. However, in the temperature range between \(35\) K and \(T_{\rm{N}}=46\) K, the agreement between the calculation and the observed spectra is poor; the height of the observed central peak is larger than calculated. This indicates that the transition into the antiferromagnetically ordered state is of first order. In fact, the splitting does not decrease continuously toward \(T_{\rm{N}}\), as would be expected for a second-order phase transition.

The internal field \(H_{\rm{int}}\) can be deduced from the shift of the central peak for \(H\parallel a\) and/or the splitting of the peaks for \(H\parallel c\). The temperature dependence of \(H_{\rm{int}}\) is shown in Fig. 3. [26] Below \(T_{\rm{N}}\) the internal field develops rapidly, reaching to \(0.8\) T at \(T=9\) K. The saturated internal field is about half that for the undoped parent compound with \(T_{\rm{N}}\sim 140\) K (\(H_{\rm{int}}\sim 1.5\) T). For \(H\parallel c\), the signal becomes very weak below \(T=25\) K, the spectrum is spread over a wide frequency range. For \(H\parallel a\), on the other hand, the uncertainty to calculate \(H_{\rm{int}}\) from the peak shift becomes large near \(T_{\rm{N}}\).

The right axis of Fig. 3 is the magnitude of the ordered magnetic moment per Fe atom, \(m\), which is deduced from \(H_{\rm{int}}=A_{\rm{hf}}\cdot m\) by assuming that the hyperfine coupling constant \(A_{\rm{hf}}\) is the same as in the undoped compound. [25] The estimated moment size at \(T=9\) K is about \(0.45\mu_{B}\), which is about half that in the undoped compound. [24] At the moment, we cannot rule out the possibility that the hyperfine coupling

  constant increases upon doping, since the bond length changes upon doping. In that case, the ordered moment can be smaller than displayed in Fig. 3.

Next we discuss the temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate \(1/T_{1}\) which is measured at the central peak for \(H\parallel a\) and plotted in Fig. 4. The \(1/T_{1}\) shows an upturn with decreasing \(T\) and forms a peak at \(T_{\rm N}=46\) K, due to a critical slowing down of the magnetic moments. Below \(T_{\rm N}=46\) K, \(1/T_{1}\) decreases and becomes nearly proportional to \(T\) before superconductivity sets in. Below \(T_{\rm c}(\mu_{0}H=12\) T) = 16 K, \(1/T_{1}\) shows another sharp reduction, and follows a \(T^{3}\) relation. At further low temperatures, the decrease of \(1/T_{1}\) becomes gradual.

It should be emphasized that below \(T_{\rm N}=46\) K, \(1/T_{1}\) was measured at the shifted peak that experiences an internal magnetic field. Therefore, the sharp decrease of \(1/T_{1}\) below \(T_{\rm c}\) indicates that the electrons that are hyperfine coupled to the nuclei produce both the magnetic order and superconductivity. Our results are clear and direct evidence that AFM coexists microscopically with superconductivity. Furthermore, \(H_{\rm int}\) is not reduced below \(T_{\rm c}\), as can be seen in Fig. 3, which suggests that the magnetic order is determined by an energy scale much larger than that of Cooper pairing.

In Ce-based heavy fermion compounds, the same electronic band derived from Ce-4\(f^{1}\) electrons is responsible for both AFM and SC, so that the ordered magnetic moment is small.[1, 2] In such a case, AFM and SC may be envisaged as different sides of a single coin.[27] In the U-based heavy fermion compound UPd\({}_{2}\)Al\({}_{3}\), which is a multiband system, on the other hand, the situation is more complex. It is believed that different electron bands bear respective responsibility for AFM and SC, which allows a large ordered magnetic moment of \(0.85\mu_{B}\) to coexist with SC.[3, 28] The current compound is also a multiband system, with some orbitals strongly Hund coupled which are more localized and the others more itinerant.[29] It is plausible that the moderate size of the ordered moment arises from the more localized \(d\) orbitals, so that it can coexist with SC, which is mainly due to the more itinerant orbitals. Thus, our work demonstrates the richness of the physics of multiple-orbital electron systems. The microscopic coexistence of AFM and SC in the present system also suggests that the Fe pnictides can provide another good opportunity to study the issues such as quantum critical point and associated physics which have been long debated in cuprate high-\(T_{\rm c}\) superconductors.[8, 9]

We note that the property of the superconducting state with the coexisting magnetism is unusual. Namely, the temperature dependence of \(1/T_{1}\) below \(T_{\rm c}\) is much weaker than in the optimally doped sample Ba\({}_{0.68}\)K\({}_{0.32}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (\(T_{\rm c}=38.5\) K), where \(1/T_{1}\) follows an exponential decrease down to very low temperatures.[20] Impurity scattering can hardly explain the difference since both samples have a similar degree of cleanness as evidenced by the similar NMR linewidth (\(\sim\)83 kHz at \(T=100\) K and \(\mu_{0}H=12\) T). We therefore attribute such a weaker \(T\) dependence to the coexisting magnetism. One possibility is that fluctuations of the coexisting magnetic moment contribute significantly to \(1/T_{1}\) in the superconducting state. This is an unexplored frontier and we hope that our finding will stimulate more theoretical works. Other possible explanations include two existing theories. One

  is the odd-frequency superconducting state proposed for heavy fermions near a quantum critical point which is a gapless state [30]. The other is a theory proposed for iron pnictides where a nodal superconducting gap is stabilized in the doping region coexisting with magnetic order [31].

For completeness, we show in Fig. 5 the quantity \(1/T_{1}T\) as a function of \(T\) for the underdoped (\(x=0.23\)), optimally doped (\(x=0.32\), \(T_{\rm c}=38.5\) K) [20], and overdoped (\(x=0.61\), \(T_{\rm c}=24.5\) K) samples. None of them shows a Korringa relation (\(1/T_{1}T={\rm const}\)) expected for a conventional metal. The \(1/T_{1}T\) increases with decreasing temperature for the underdoped and optimally doped samples, which is due to the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. At high temperatures, the value of \(1/T_{1}T\), which is dominated by the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level, increases with increasing doping, which indicates that the DOS increases with increasing doping.

In conclusion, by \({}^{75}\)As NMR measurements on an underdoped single-crystal Ba\({}_{0.77}\)K\({}_{0.23}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) with \(T_{\rm c}=16.5\) K, we found clear and direct evidence for a microscopic coexistence of antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity. Below \(T_{\rm N}=46\) K, the NMR peaks for \(H\parallel c\) split and those for \(H\parallel a\) shift to higher frequencies, which indicates that an internal magnetic field develops due to the ordered Fe moment lying on the \(ab\) plane. The spin-lattice relaxation rate \(1/T_{1}\) measured at the shifted peak with \(H\parallel a\) shows distinct decreases at \(T_{\rm N}=46\) K and \(T_{\rm c}(\mu_{0}H=12\) T) = 16 K, respectively. Since the nuclei corresponding to the shifted peak experience an internal magnetic field below \(T_{\rm N}\), our results show unambiguously that the electrons that are hyperfine coupled to the nuclei produce both the antiferromagnetic order and form Cooper pairs below \(T_{\rm c}(\mu_{0}H=12\) T) = 16 K. The superconducting state with the coexisting magnetism is unusual and deserves further studies, in particular, theoretically.
