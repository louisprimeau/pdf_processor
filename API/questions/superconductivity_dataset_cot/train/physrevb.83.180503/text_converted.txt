###### Abstract

We report the discovery of K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)S₂ single crystals,
isostructural to K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ superconductors. The sulfide
compound is a small gap semiconductor and shows spin-glass behavior
below 32 K. Our results indicate that stoichiometry, defects, and the
local environment of FeCh (Ch = S,Se) tetrahedra have important effects
on the physical properties of isostructural and isoelectronic
K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Ch₂ compounds.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B **83**, 180503(R) (2011)

Iron-based materials have been the focus of exploratory search for new
superconductors since the discovery of LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) with a
transition temperature T_(c) up to 26 K.[1] Several superconducting
families were discovered soon after _R_FePnO (_R_ = rare earth; Pn = P
or As, FePn-1111 type),[2; 3; 4] including _a_-PbO-type FeCh (Ch =
S,Se,Te; FeCh-11 type) materials that do not have any crystallographic
layers in between puckered FeCh slabs.[4] FeCh-11-type materials share a
square-planar lattice of Fe with a tetrahedral coordination and Fermi
surface topology similar to other iron-based superconductors.[5] Under
external pressure,[6; 7]T_(c) can be increased from 8 to 37 K and
dT_(c)/dP can reach 9.1 K/GPa, the highest in all iron-based
superconductors.[7] The empirical rule proposed by Mizuguchi _et al._
proposes that the critical temperature is closely correlated with the
anion height between Fe and Ch layers. There is an optimal distance
around 0.138 nm with a maximum transition temperature T_(c) ≃ 55 K.[8]

Intercalation can change the local environment of the FeSe tetrahedron
and introduce extra carriers. The intercalation could also decrease the
dimensionality of the conducting bands. This is favorable for
superconductivity since the presence of low-energy electronic collective
modes in layered conductors helps to screen Coulomb interaction.[9] This
is seen in iron-based superconductors: T_(c) increases from FeCh-11 type
to FePn-1111 type. Very recently the superconducting T_(c) was enhanced
in iron selenide material to about 30 K not by external pressure but by
inserting K, Rb, Cs, and Tl between the FeSe layers (AFeSe-122 type),
thus changing the crystal structure around the FeCh tetrahedra.[10; 11;
12; 13] Similar to pressure effects, the intercalation using elements
with +1 valence decreases the Se height toward the optimum value.[12]
The expanded FeSe interlayer distances could also contribute to reducing
the dimensionality of the conducting bands and magnetic interactions. On
the other hand, the insulating-superconducting transition can be induced
in (Tl_(1 − x)K_(x))Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ by tuning the Fe stoichiometry and
implying that the superconductivity is in the proximity of an
antiferromagnetic Mott-insulating state.[13] Thus, exploring new
oxychalcogenide and chalcogenide compounds containing similar FeCh
layers would be instructive.

In this Rapid Communication, we report the discovery of
K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)S₂ single crystals isostructural to 122 iron selenide
superconductors. The structure analysis indicates that the anion height
might not be essential for superconductivity. The resistivity and
magnetic measurements suggest a spin-glass (SG) semiconductor ground
state similar to that of the TlFe_(2 − x)Se₂ with high Fe deficiency,
even though the anion heights are close to values found in iron-based
superconductors with T_(c) above 20 K.[13; 14]

Single crystals of K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)S₂ were grown via the self-flux
method[15] with nominal composition K:Fe:S = 0.8:2:2. Prereacted FeS and
K pieces were added into the alumina crucible with a partial pressure of
argon gas. The quartz tubes were heated to 1030degC, kept at this
temperature for 3 h, then cooled to 730degC. Platelets crystals up to
10 × 10 × 3 mm³ can be grown. Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) data were
collected at 300 K using 0.3184-A wavelength radiation (38.94 keV) at
the X7B beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source. The average
stoichiometry was determined by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy
(EDX). Electrical transport, heat capacity, and magnetization
measurements were carried out in Quantum Design PPMS-9 and MPMS-XL5.

Figure 1(a) shows powder XRD data at room temperature and structural
refinements on K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)S₂ using General Structure Analysis System
(GSAS).[16; 17] A model possessing tetragonal ThCr₂Si₂ structure and
space group I4/mmm failed to explain the observed diffraction pattern
due to the clear appearance of (110) and other superlattice reflections
indicating symmetry lowering to I4/m. Data were successfully explained
to within I4/m symmetry, incorporating the Fe vacancy order site, with
lattice parameters a = 8.3984(5) A and c = 13.5988(11) A, which are
appreciably smaller than those observed in the selenium counterpart.[10]
The c axis is particularly reduced due to the smaller ionic size of S²⁻
when compared to Se²⁻. The ordered Fe vacancy is the same as in
K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂.[18] This may imply a similar origin of magnetic
behavior for both compounds. Atomic positions with refined parameters
are listed in Table I. Refinements yield that K1, K2, and Fe1 positions
are partially occupied, while Fe2 positions are almost fully occupied.
It should be noted that, when K1 and Fe1 positions are fully unoccupied
while K2 and Fe2 are fully occupied, the corresponding chemical formula
is K_(0.8)Fe_(1.6)S₂ and the Fe vacancy is completely ordered. The
average atomic ratios from EDX are consistent with
K_(0.88(6))Fe_(1.63(4))S_(2.00(1)), indicating that there are both
potassium and iron deficiencies from ideal 122 stoichiometry, in good
agreement with XRD fitting results. It should be noted that 18.5

The in-plane resistivity ρ_(ab)(T) of the K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)S₂ single
crystal rapidly increases with decreasing the temperature from
$\rho_{\rm ab}$(300 K) ∼ 100 mΩ cm and there is no obvious magnetometers
(Fig. 2). The $\rho_{\rm ab}$(T) is thermally activated:
ρ = ρ₀exp (E_(a)/k_(B)T), where ρ₀ is a prefactor and k_(B) is the
Boltzmann constant [inset (b) of Fig. 2]. Using the ρ_(ab)(T) data from
70 to 300 K, we estimate ρ₀∼ 11.7(2) mΩ cm and the activation energy
E_(a) = 51.8(2) meV. The semiconducting behavior might be at least
partially ascribed to the deficiency of Fe in the Fe-Se plane that would
introduce a random scattering potential, just like in highly Fe
deficient K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ and TlFe_(2 − x)Se₂.[13, 14, 19]

The magnetic susceptibility with H∥ab is larger than with H∥c [Fig.
3(a)], similar to the observed anisotropy in TlFe_(2 − x)Se₂,[14] The
most interesting characteristics are the absence of Curie-Weiss behavior
and the obvious bifurcation between the zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and
field-cooling (FC) curves below 32 K. This might suggest the presence of
low-dimensional short-range magnetic correlations and/or a long-range
magnetic order above 300 K, and an antiferromagnetic phase transition at
low temperatures. The M(T) irreversible behavior below 32 K implies some
ferromagnetic contribution to magnetic susceptibility or a glassy
transition where spins would be frozen randomly below the freezing
temperature T_(f). Similar magnetization was reported in TlFe_(2 − x)Se₂
and

KFeCuS₂. [14, 20] The inset in Fig. 3(a) shows the magnetization loops
for H∥c. At 250 K, the M-H loop is almost linear and there is no
hysteresis. However, an S-shaped M-H loop can be observed at 1.8 K,
which is typical behavior of a SG system. [14] The S-shaped M-H loop is
present at T = 50 K, which indicates that short-range ferromagnetic
interaction may exist above T_(f). As shown in Fig. 3(b), the peak in
the real part of ac susceptibility χ^(′)(T) exhibits strong frequency
dependence in an ac magnetic field. When the frequency increases, the
peak positions shift to higher temperatures whereas the magnitudes
decrease, indicating typical SG behavior. [21] By fitting the frequency
dependence of the peak shift using K = ΔT_(f)/(T_(f)Δlog f), we obtained
K = 0.0134(5) [inset of Fig. 3(b)]. This is in agreement with values
(0.0045 ≤ K ≤ 0.08) found in the canonical SG system, but much smaller
than in a typical superparamagnet. [11] Figure 3(c) shows the magnetic
field dependence of the thermoremanent magnetization (TRM). The sample
was cooled from T = 60 K (above T_(f)) in a magnetic field to T = 10 K
(below T_(f)) and then kept at 10 K for t_(w) = 100 s. Then the magnetic
field was removed and the magnetization decay M_(TRM)(t) was measured.
It can be seen that, below T_(f) (T = 10 K), M_(TRM)(t) decays slowly so
its value is nonzero even after several hours. This is another signature
of the SG behavior, i.e., the existence of extremely slow spin
relaxation below T_(f). [21] In contrast, above T_(f), M_(TRM)(t)
quickly relaxes and does not show slow decay [inset (a) of Fig. 3(c)].
The magnetization decay can be explained well using a stretched
exponential function commonly used to explain TRM behavior in SG
systems, M_(TRM)(t) = M₀exp [−(t/τ)^(1 − n)], where M₀, τ, and 1 − n are
the glassy component, the relaxation characteristic time, and the
critical exponent, respectively. It can be seen inset (b) of Fig. 3(c)]
that τ decreases significantly with field but 1 − n increases slightly.
On the other hand, the value of 1 − n is close to 1/3, consistent with
theoretical predictions and the experiments on traditional SG systems.
[22, 23] The SG behavior could originate from Fe clusters induced by
vacancies and disorder, and the exchange interactions between spins
within a cluster would depend on the distribution of iron ions (Table
1). [20] Indeed, in TIFe_(2 − x)Se₂, the ground state is a reentrant
spin glass if the content of Fe is less than 1.7. [14] However, for x
values larger than 1.7, TIFe_(2 − x)Se₂ becomes a superconductor below
20 K. [13] Therefore, superconductivity in K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)S₂ might be
induced for a smaller deficiency of Fe.

with H = 1 kOe and t_(w) = 100 s. Inset (b): magnetic field dependence

The specific heat of K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)S₂ (Fig. 4) approaches the
Dulong-Petit value of 3NR at high temperature, where N is the atomic
number in the chemical formula (N = 5) and R is the gas constant. At low
temperature, the specific heat can be fitted using
$C_{p}=\gamma_{\rm SO}T+\beta T^{3}$ [inset (a) of Fig. 4]. The variable
$\gamma_{\rm SO}$ is commonly found in magnetic insulating SG systems,
implying a constant density of states of the low-temperature magnetic
excitations.[24, 25, 26] The second term is due to phonon contribution.
The obtained $\gamma_{\rm SO}$ is 1.58(6) mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻². The Debye
temperatures Θ_(D) can be calculated from β through
Θ_(D) = (12π⁴NR/5β)^(1/3) to be Θ_(D) = 284.3(7) K. It should be noted
that, as opposed to the usual λ anomaly, there is a very weak broad hump
of C_(p)/T near T = 32.6 K [inset (b) of Fig. 4]. This is expected for
bulk low-dimensional or glassy magnetic systems.[24, 27, 28]

The discovery of K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)S₂ implies that it is possible to tune
conductivity and magnetism by changing chalcogen elements (S and Se) in
isostructural K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Ch₂ materials. According to Table 1, anion
heights S1 to Fe1 and S1 to Fe2 in K_(0.88(6))Fe_(1.63(4))S_(2.00(1))
are close to the alleged optimal value of 1.38 A, comparable to
distances in FePn-1111-type materials and lower than in
K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂.[8, 12] Hence, if the anion height is the crucial
parameter, the sulfide compound should be a superconductor with higher
T_(c) than that of K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂. However, it is a semiconductor,
not a superconductor. We also note that in K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)S₂ there are
two Fe sites and two corresponding anion heights. Our results indicate
that the anion height values may be not essential parameters that govern
superconductivity in AFeSe-122 compounds. In contrast, it suggests that
disorder and site occupancies are significantly important.

In summary, we report the discovery of K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)S₂ single crystals
isostructural to T_(c) = 33 K superconductor K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ and
exhibiting a similar width of formation and vacancies at both potassium
and iron sites. Sulfide material is semiconducting and glassy magnetic,
suggesting that the physical properties are governed by stoichiometry,
defects, and local environment of Fe-S tetrahedra.
