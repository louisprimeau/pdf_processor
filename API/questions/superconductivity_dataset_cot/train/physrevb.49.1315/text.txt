###### Abstract

High-quality as-grown Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{y}\) single crystals with superconducting transition temperatures \(T_{c}\) of 70-83 K have been annealed in air, flowing oxygen, and nitrogen at 400-750 degC. ac susceptibility measurements show that at 450-550 degC \(T_{c}\) is atmosphere and time independently enhanced to 85-86 K and a very narrow diamagnetic transition \(\Delta T_{c}\) (10-90 % of the complete transition) of 0.5-1 K is obtained, and at 550-750 degC when treated in nitrogen or oxygen \(T_{c}\) increases or decreases and \(\Delta T_{c}\) broadens with annealing temperature compared with crystals annealed at 450-550 degC. The results are difficult to explain simply by the consideration of oxygen diffusion. Combined with the phase decomposition induced in the annealed crystals, it is suggested that the structural modification may play an important role in the variation of superconductivity of Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{y}\) superconductors.

## Introduction

It has been reported that \(T_{c}\) of Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{y}\) (Bi-2:2:1:2) superconductors can be shifted over a range of at least 15 K (Refs. 1,2) and up to 96 K (Ref. 3) by proper thermal treatments. Clarification of this variation of \(T_{c}\) is undoubtedly important for understanding the mechanism of high-\(T_{c}\) superconductivity and also for materials design. For this purpose, recently a great deal of effort has been devoted to the study of the effect of annealing on the superconducting properties of the Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{y}\) system.

For the polycrystalline Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{y}\) superconductor, the effect of annealing on \(T_{c}\) has been studied in detail.1,3-9 It was concluded that \(T_{c}\) depended strongly on oxygen content and there existed an optimum oxygen concentration corresponding to a maximum \(T_{c}\) in the system,4,8,9 though the optimum amount was quite different according to different authors.1,9 At the same time, structural changes associated with the annealing treatments were also suggested to be responsible for the variation of superconductivity by some groups.5,10

However, as far as the single crystal Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{y}\) is concerned, \(T_{c}\) of which was found to be more sensitive to oxygen configuration11 and usually the structural change of which can be easily observed in contrast to that of polycrystalline samples, the effect of annealing on superconductivity has not been studied systematically until now. The relationship between oxygen content and \(T_{c}\) and \(\Delta T_{c}\) (10-90 % of complete transition) of the single crystals has been investigated by Mitzi _et al._12 and Emmen _et al._13 under certain annealing conditions, but some points are still controversial. For example, according to Mitzi _et al._, \(\Delta T_{c}\) was essentially unchanged after the crystal annealed at 540 degC in different oxygen pressure, while Emmen _et al._ reported that very narrow diamagnetic transitions were observed for the crystals treated in 1 bar oxygen pressure and at 400-700 degC. Moreover, the effect of structural changes induced by annealing treatments such as the phase decomposition14,15 on superconductivity is rarely discussed.

As has been pointed out,13\(T_{c}\) and \(\Delta T_{c}\) of single crystals are both indications for the distribution of excess oxygen concentration and therefore determine the kinetics of oxygen in and out diffusion. On the other hand, according to Runde _et al._16 the kinetics of oxygen diffusion in Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{y}\) single crystals is strongly temperature and time dependent, which should be reflected by the variation of \(T_{c}\) and \(\Delta T_{c}\).

In view of these points, for the single crystal, more extensive studies on the dependence of \(T_{c}\) and \(\Delta T_{c}\) on the annealing atmosphere, temperature, and time are needed. In this paper, we report the results of ac susceptibility measurements on a number of high-quality Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{y}\) single-crystal sheets before and after annealing in air, flowing oxygen, and nitrogen at 400-750 degC and for different times. Every crystal sheet was annealed for only one time and some crystal sheets employed were cut up from one large crystal so that more direct and comparative studies on the effect of annealing on superconductivity of Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{y}\) superconductors could be derived. It is found that the results are difficult to explain simply by the oxygen configuration, and we suggest that the structural modification indicated by surface phase decomposition in the annealing processes may play an important role in the variation of superconductivity of Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{y}\) superconductors.

  

## Experiment

Bi2Sr2CaCu2O3 single-crystal sheets with thickness around 30 _m_m and average in-plane dimensions of 7 mm x 3 mm were grown from Bi-rich melts by a directional solidification method. The atomic ratio of the grown melts was of 2.4Bi:2.0Sr:1.0Ca:2.0Cu and the thermal cycle program for the crystal growing process was similar to that described elsewhere.17 To ensure the homogeneity of the crystals with regard to the composition, structure, and oxygen content, bright crystals with in-plane dimensions of 3 mm x 2 mm and thicknesses of about 20 _m_m were chosen as candidates for the annealing experiments. In some cases, large crystal sheets with dimensions around 8 x 3 x 0.02 mm3 were also chosen and then cut up into several pieces by a sharp scalpel to undergo different annealing treatments. Before annealing, all the crystals were characterized by x-ray diffractions (XRD), both the (001) diffraction and the rocking curve of the (0010) main reflection, so that well-oriented single crystals with only the (001) diffractions of the 2:2:1:2 phase were selected. After the ac susceptibility measurements the selected as-grown samples were then loaded in a high-purity alumina boat to undergo thermal treatments. All the treatments were performed in a tubular furnace with temperature and time monitored by a microprocessor, and the gas flow rate was adjustable. Annealing treatments in O2 or air were followed by furnace cooling in the same atmosphere and thermal treatments in flowing N2 were completed by quenching to room temperature in the same atmosphere.

ac susceptibility was measured with a magnetic field (0.02 Oe, 108 Hz) perpendicular to the crystal basal plane (_H_ ||_c_). X-ray diffraction data were collected using a rotating-anode diffractometer (D/Max-_g_A, Rigaku) with graphite monochromatized CuK_a_ radiation.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figure 1 shows the variations of the ac susceptibility for a set of single crystals before and after annealing in air at 400, 500, 550, and 750 degC for 20 h. At 400 degC, \(T_{c}\) and D_T__c_ of the annealed crystal are almost the same as those of the as-grown crystal. Data on another sample annealed under the same conditions but with \(T_{c}\) as grown lower show that after annealing \(T_{c}\) is slightly increased but D_T__c_ remains essentially unchanged (not shown in the figure). For the crystals annealed at 500 and 550 degC, \(T_{c}\) is increased to the same value of almost 86 K and the diamagnetic transition becomes very steep with D_T__c_ of about 0.5 K. After annealing at 750 degC, \(T_{c}\) of the crystal is increased to 88 K but D_T__c_ is broadened to 2.2 K.

The enhancement of \(T_{c}\) and the very narrow diamagnetic transition are commonly found for the crystals annealed at 450-550 degC. In this temperature range \(T_{c}\) always increases to 85-86 K and D_T__c_ decreases to 0.5-1 K, and it is revealed to be time and atmosphere independent. In Fig. 2, for the three single crystals annealed at 550 degC and for different times, whatever the \(T_{c}\) as grown is, \(T_{c}\) is increased to 85 K and for only 1.5 h the diamagnetic transition has dramatically steepened. The narrowness of the diamagnetic transitions was also observed by Emmen _et al._13 for the crystals annealed at temperatures from 450 to 700 degC in 1-bar oxygen but for 60 h so that a homogeneous oxygen content through the entire sample is obtained. In our experiments, however, the sharp transition of the crystals annealed at 450-550 degC is almost time independent. This is difficult to explain in view of the oxygen diffusion and equilibrium, which means that the homogeneity of the superconductive phase of the crystals annealed at 450-550 degC may not be obtained by the homogeneous oxygen content.

In fact, x-ray diffraction patterns of the crystals annealed at temperatures over 450 degC are all changed. Figure 3 shows a group of typical XRD patterns of the crys

 tals annealed in air at 400, 450, 550, and 650 degC for 20 h. At 400 degC, no reflection other than the (001) reflections of the Bi2Sr2CaCu2O3 (2:2:1:2) phase (indexed) is observed. But when temperature is increased to 450 degC, phases of Bi2O3 (pseudo-orthorhombic symmetry and \(a\) = 5.850 A, \(b\) = 8.165 A, and \(c\) = 13.827 A) with reflections denoted by open squares and Bi2O2.75 (tetragonal, \(a\) = 3.85 A and \(c\) = 12.25 A) indicated by open circles are segregated from the 2:2:1:2 phase. When annealed at 550 degC, one more phase with reflections at Bragg angles 9.5deg, 18.9deg, 28.5deg, and 35.3deg is created which has been frequently observed in the Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O compounds18-20 and is regarded to be associated with a Cu-free Bi2Sr2Ca oxide phase with crystal structure similar to the tetragonal Bi1,Sr0.9O2.55, which displays characteristic spacings of 9.3 A (110).21 At 650 degC the as-grown crystals have undergone structural changes more dramatically. In addition to the Bi2Sr2Ca2 oxide phase, the Bi2Sr2CuO3 (2:2:0:1) phase appears (the reflections are indicated by dots in the top panel in Fig. 3). Studies on the phase determination and evolution have indicated that the decomposed phases are strictly temperature dependent and are found mainly in the surface part of the annealed crystals.15

The temperature (around 450 degC) at which the phase decomposition (detected by XRD) of the as-grown Bi2Sr2CaCu2O3 single crystals begins to take place is in accordance with the temperature at which (after the samples were annealed) the very narrow diamagnetic transition can be observed. The phases of Bi oxides decomposed from the as-grown single crystals, though mainly in the surface part of the annealed crystals, provide important information on the stability of the whole crystals. The inset of the top panel in Fig. 2 shows part of the XRD pattern for the annealed crystal, which may reflect that the structure modification in the annealed crystal indicated by the surface-phase decomposition is connected with and thereby responsible for the homogeneity of the superconductive phase of the crystals.

It should be mentioned here that we have removed the surface decomposed part from some annealed crystals by using adhesive tapes to detect whether the variation of superconductivity of the crystal is created by the surface decomposed part or not. ac susceptibility measurements

Reflections of Bi2O3, Bi2O2.75, and Bi2Sr2Ca oxide decomposed from the 2:2:1:2 phase (indexed) are represented by open squares, open circles, and full circles, respectively. Reflections denoted by dots in the top panel are assigned to the Bi2Sr2CuO3 (2:2:0:1) phase.

  on the newly cleaved crystals have shown that the answer is negative. It also confirms that the homogeneity of the superconductive phase of the whole annealed crystals is achieved.

To observe the variations of \(T_{c}\) and \(\Delta T_{c}\) of the same crystal annealed in different atmosphere, high-purity and well-oriented Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{y}\) single crystal with large dimensions has been selected and then cut up into two pieces to undergo treatments at the same temperature but in O\({}_{2}\) or N\({}_{2}\), respectively. Figure 4 shows the typical results of ac susceptibility data on two sets of the crystals annealed at 550 and 750 degC and for 20 h. For comparison, results of the as-grown crystals are also shown in the figure. It can be seen that for the crystal annealed in N\({}_{2}\) or O\({}_{2}\), \(\Delta T_{c}\) always increases, which is surely difficult to explain in terms of the variation of oxygen configuration. If the variation of \(T_{c}\) is only controlled by the oxygen concentration in the crystals, \(T_{c}\) should shift in opposite directions when treated in the two kinds of atmosphere.[2, 22]

On the other hand, in Fig. 4 it is shown that \(T_{c}\) of the crystal sheet treated in N\({}_{2}\) is always higher than that of the sheet treated in O\({}_{2}\). And when the temperature is increased from 550 to 750 degC, \(T_{c}\) of the crystals annealed in nitrogen increases from 87 to 92 K and \(T_{c}\) of the crystals treated in oxygen decreases relatively from 84.5 to 82 K. The diamagnetic transitions of the crystal annealed at 550 degC are steeper than those of the crystals annealed at higher temperatures such as 750 degC. All these facts indicate that the oxygen content and contribution are responsible for the variation of superconductivity of the crystals when treated at higher temperatures (over 550 degC).

The phase situation of the crystals annealed in flowing nitrogen or oxygen were also examined by x-ray diffraction. It is revealed that at 450\(-\)550 degC phases decomposed are the same as those from the crystals annealed in air (cf. Fig. 3), and at higher temperature the phase decomposition in O\({}_{2}\) is more dramatic than that in N\({}_{2}\) (Fig. 5). This means that at higher temperature the surface-phase decomposition is related to the annealing atmosphere, but at 450\(-\)550 degC it is not.

According to the oxygen tracer diffusion experiments reported by Runde _et al._,[16] oxygen diffusion in Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{y}\) single crystals is rather slow at temperatures lower than 550 degC (at 500 degC for 216 h, about 1.2 \(\mu\)m in the \(c\) direction) but increases rapidly with increasing temperature which further confirms that at lower temperature the oxygen mobility in the crystals is too low to achieve oxygen homogeneity of the entire crystal within the annealing time stated. Thus, in view of the experimental results mentioned above and the phases segregat

  ed (bismuth oxides and bismuth strontium oxides), we suggest that when the annealing temperature is over 450 degC, the structural modification in Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{y}\) single crystals occurs and it is responsible for the variations of superconductivity in the annealed crystals. In general, the process of the structural adjustment should be atmosphere and time independent so that after annealing, even in different atmospheres and for a short time, the superconducting homogeneity of the crystal can be achieved. Further investigations of the structural changes such as the variation in the modulations [3, 5] are in progress.

## Conclusions

In summary, a number of high-quality as-grown Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{y}\) single crystals with \(T_{c}\) 70-83 K have been annealed in air, flowing nitrogen, and oxygen at 400\(-\)750 degC, and for different times. After being annealed at 450\(-\)550 degC all the crystals have shown superconducting transitions at a value around 86 K with \(\Delta T_{c}\) of about 0.5 K, which is almost atmosphere and time independent and therefore difficult to explain by consideration of the oxygen configuration. Together with the surface-phase decomposition observed, structure modification in the annealed crystals is suggested to occur and to be responsible for the variation of superconductivity of the crystals. When heat treated at higher temperatures (550\(-\)750 degC) and in different atmospheres, temperature dependences of \(T_{c}\) and \(\Delta T_{c}\) of the annealed crystals can be well interpreted with the points of the oxygen configuration as well as the structural modification.
