###### Abstract

We report the magnetic and superconducting properties of locally
noncentrosymmetric SrPtAs obtained by muon-spin-rotation/relaxation
(μSR) measurements. Zero-field μSR reveals the occurrence of small
spontaneous static magnetic fields with the onset of superconductivity.
This finding suggests that the superconducting state of SrPtAs breaks
time-reversal symmetry. The superfluid density as determined by
transverse field μSR is nearly flat approaching T = 0 K proving the
absence of extended nodes in the gap function. By symmetry, several
superconducting states supporting time-reversal-symmetry breaking in
SrPtAs are allowed. Out of these, a dominantly d + id (chiral d-wave)
order parameter is most consistent with our experimental data.

Present address: ]Department of Physics, University of California,
Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697, USA Figure 1 shows ZF-μSR time spectra for
SrPtAs. Open circles indicate data collected at 3.5 K (above T_(c)) and
closed circles data collected at 0.019 K (below T_(c)). Data taken below
T_(c) show a greater relaxation than above T_(c). The small relaxation
above T_(c) arises from randomly orientated nuclear magnetic dipole
moments that are static on the time scale of μSR. The additional
relaxation of the muon spin polarization P(t) below T_(c) is caused by
spontaneous magnetic moments which may be either quasistatic or dynamic.
To distinguish between these two possibilities, we have performed LF-μSR
in a weak magnetic field of 9 mT. We find that this field is sufficient
to decouple the muon spin polarization (see the lower panel of Fig. 2)
which proves that the additional spontaneous magnetic relaxation
appearing below T_(c) in the ZF-μSR data is due to quasistatic
moments.[8] To quantitatively evaluate the ZF-μSR spectra, we fitted a
combination of a static Lorentzian and Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe relaxation
function [9, 10, 11] to the data:

$$P(t)=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{3}(1-\Delta_{nn}^{2}t^{2}-\Lambda t)\exp\bigg{(}- \frac{\Delta_{nn}^{2}t^{2}}{2}-\Lambda t\bigg{)}.$$

Here Δ_(nn) and Λ are the temperature-independent Gaussian and the
temperature-dependent exponential muon relaxation rates due to the
presence of nuclear and electronic moments, respectively. The solid
lines in Fig. 1 are fits to the data using this equation.

Both samples of SrPtAs measured at two different μSR facilities show
very similar spectra. In both cases a small increase of the relaxation
rate is observed below the superconducting T_(c). Figure 2 shows the
temperature-dependent part of the relaxation rate ΔΛ = Λ(T) − Λ(T ≈ 5 K)
for both samples. The increase of the relaxation indicates the
appearance of a spontaneous magnetic field in the superconducting state
of SrPtAs. The existence of such a spontaneous field in SrPtAs and its
correlation with the superconducting T_(c) provides evidence for a
superconducting state that breaks TRS. A similar behavior has been
observed by μSR in the spin-triplet TRS-breaking superconductor
Sr₂RuO₄.[13] Possible origins for the occurrence of TRS breaking in
SrPtAs will be discussed below, but we first turn to the experimental
characterization of the superconducting properties of SrPtAs.

To reveal information on the pairing symmetry in the presence of TRS
breaking, we have also performed TF-μSR measurements in a field of 9 mT,
which is larger than the first critical field of ≈4 mT that we
determined by low-temperature magnetization measurements. Figure 3 shows
TF-μSR precession signals of sample A of SrPtAs above and below T_(c).
In the normal state, the oscillation only shows very small relaxation.
Below T_(c), the relaxation rate increases due to the broad field
distribution produced by the presence of the vortex lattice. Solid lines
are fits to the data using a sinusoidally oscillating function with a
Gaussian decay component:

where P_(s) and P_(bgd) are the relative fractions of muons hitting the
sample and the Ag sample holder, respectively, the latter

and background magnetic field at the muon sites, ϕ = −π/2 is the phase
of the initial muon spin polarization with respect to the positron
detector, and σ is the Gaussian muon spin relaxation rate. σ can be
written as σ = (σ_(sc)² + σ_(nn)²)^(1/2), where σ_(sc) is the
superconducting contribution to the relaxation rate due to the field
variation across the flux line lattice, and σ_(nn) is the nuclear
magnetic dipolar contribution which is assumed to be constant over the
temperature range of the study.

Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependence of σ for SrPtAs for sample
A. Qualitatively similar data are obtained for sample B. In a
superconductor with an ideal Ginzburg-Landau vortex lattice, σ_(sc) is
related to the penetration depth λ via Brandt’s equation[15]

where b = H/H_(c2) is the ratio of the applied field to the upper
critical field. The temperature dependence of λ⁻² is shown in Fig. 4(b)
for which we used the data of Ref. [2] to estimate the temperature
dependence of H_(c2). The slope of the temperature dependence of the
superconducting order parameter tends to zero as the temperature
approaches zero, indicating the absence of low-lying excitations. This
is corroborated by a reasonable fit of the data with a one-band BCS
s-wave model. In contrast, a one-band model with line nodes is unable to
reproduce the data.[25] However, we emphasize that in SrPtAs multiple
electronic bands cross the Fermi level and that SrPtAs lacks locally an
inversion symmetry center. Hence, unconventional order parameter
symmetries and multiband superconductivity can be expected. Therefore,
such a simple model description of the superfluid density is not likely
to reveal the true underlying pairing symmetry. However, with the
present statistical accuracy we are at least confident that SrPtAs has
no extended nodes in the gap function. This conclusion holds for both
samples even though the measured low-temperature magnetic penetration
depth is about 30

Interestingly, the internal magnetic field B_(int) clearly increases by
about 0.15 mT below T_(c) as shown for sample A in the inset of Fig. 4.
This behavior is unexpected since typically one observes a diamagnetic
shift in spin-singlet superconductors or a constant field in
spin-triplet superconductors. More detailed studies, especially on
single crystals, for which demagnetization effects can be properly taken
into account are required to understand this phenomenon in detail, but
we suggest that this positive internal field shift might be related to
the occurrence of TRS breaking in SrPtAs.

In summary, we found experimental evidence for (i) weak breaking of TRS
that sets in at the same temperature as the superconducting order and
(ii) no extended nodes in the order parameter. In the following, we will
discuss possible origins of TRS breaking for different order parameter
symmetries in the light of these experimental observations.[26]

(i) _Chiral bulk and surface states._ The most straightforward
explanation for bulk TRS breaking is a superconducting order parameter
of dominantly d + id symmetry, the so-called chiral E_(g) state.[6] This
state can be stabilized in a scenario where superconductivity is driven
by the Van Hove singularities located around the M points; see Fig. 5.
Intuitively, this can be explained using the following parallel to the
cuprates: On the square lattice, repulsive scattering between the _two_
Van Hove singularities favors the d_(x² − y²) order parameter symmetry
with signchange. On a lattice with twofold rotational symmetry,
repulsive scattering between the _three_ Van Hove singularities is
frustrated. The phases of the superconducting order parameter near the
Van Hove points, ϕ_(i), i = 1, 2, 3, then spontaneously choose one of
the TRS breaking _chiral_ configurations ϕ₁ − ϕ₂ = ϕ₂ − ϕ₃ = ±2π/3 [see
Fig. 5(a)].[16; 17] The E_(g) state supports topologically protected
chiral modes at the surface and at defects, such as the implanted muon
itself.

(ii) _Frustrated interband Cooper pair scattering._ An alternative
scenario for bulk TRS breaking is based on frustrated Cooper pair
scattering between multiple disconnected Fermi pockets[18] located at
the K and K^(′) points. Starting from a nodeless s-wave superconducting
order parameter (A_(1g) symmetry), this interpocket scattering leads to
a similar chiral phase structure as in scenario (i), however, with
constant phases ϕ_(i), i = 1, 2, 3, on each pair of pockets [see Fig.
5(b)]. Here, the TRS breaking is a secondary transition out of a
conventional s-wave superconductor.

(iii) _TRS breaking at the surface._ In view of the granularity of our
samples, we comment on the possibility of spontaneous TRS breaking at
the boundary, while the bulk remains in a TRS

nodes, respectively.

superconducting state. Such surface effects can be expected for a
dominantly f-wave superconductor (A_(2n) state), with a gap function
that changes sign under a π/3 rotation around the z axis [see Fig.
5(c)]. On the one hand, this sign change influences the Andreev
scattering on the sample surface, if the surface normal has a
nonvanishing component in the plane defined by the layers [see Fig.
5(c)]. Energetically, the destructively interfering scattering process
leads to a suppression of the A_(2n) state close to the surface.
Topologically, it equips the surface with a dispersionless 2D band
structure with a degeneracy protected by TRS. Residual interactions in
this surface flat band generically lift its degeneracy, thereby breaking
spontaneously the TRS by nucleation of a
$\Delta_{A_{\rm x}}+{\rm i}\Delta_{A_{\rm z}}$ order parameter locally
at the surface. On the other hand, due to the granularity of the sample,
three or more crystallites can form a loop around a void within the
sample, while remaining in a phase coherent superconducting state. Due
to the sign change of the gap function in the A_(2n) state, the order
parameter might acquire a phase shift of π around the loop.[19] To
account for this phase shift, half of a superconducting flux quantum
ϕ₀/2 = h/(4e) is trapped in the loop [see Fig. 5(d)]. The associated TRS
breaking supercurrent would then cause an increase in muon
depolarization rate of the muons that stop close to the loop. At low
fields these frustrated current loops are expected to give rise to an
unusual positive field shift, an effect that has also been observed in
granular samples of high-T_(c) cuprates.[19, 20] This granularity
scenario would be consistent with the positive field shift below T_(c)
of the sample (see inset of Fig. 4).

Notably, none of the above scenarios is compatible with an s-wave order
parameter symmetry. Furthermore, in the absence of fine tuning, TRS
breaking in scenarios (ii) and (iii) is expected to occur as a secondary
transition, i.e., at a temperature lower than T_(c) = 2.4 K, which is in
contradiction with our measurements. Hence, the chiral E_(g) state is
the most likely explanation for TRS breaking in SrPtAs. This state is
also favored by the second experimental finding that the gap function of
SrPtAs possesses no extended nodes since it has only a point node on one
out of six bands contributing to superconductivity, while the other
pairing symmetry allowing for TRS breaking, namely A_(2n), possesses
line nodes on four of these bands.

In conclusion, we have found small static magnetic fields in two
different samples of SrPtAs measured at two different μSR facilities.
These internal magnetic fields set in at the superconducting T_(c) and
grow with decreasing temperature. This provides strong evidence that the
superconducting state of locally noncentrosymmetric SrPtAs breaks TRS.
In addition, we observed a nearly flat temperature dependence of the
superfluid density approaching T = 0 K proving the absence of extended
nodes in the superconducting gap function. Furthermore we proposed
several scenarios which can lead to TRS breaking in SrPtAs on the basis
of the superconducting states allowed by symmetry. While the other
states cannot be completely excluded, our experimental observations are
most consistent with an E_(g) symmetry of the superconducting order
parameter which is dominated by a spin-singlet d + id (chiral d-wave)
state.
