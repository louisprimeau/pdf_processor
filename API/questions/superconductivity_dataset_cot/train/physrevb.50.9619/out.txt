###### Abstract

The magnetic-field dependence of the specific-heat measurements on Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+ with 0.5 K < T < 30 K, are reported in order to study the magnetic order in this compound. Anomalies in the specific heat _C_(_T_) of Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+ are observed at T_{N} ~ 5.3 K and T_{N} ~ 2.4 K, which are related to two antiferromagnetic transitions in the Tb sublattice. While the anomaly seen in the specific heat as well as in the magnetic susceptibility at T_{N} ~ 5.3 K is suppressed, the peak position is unaffected with increasing magnetic fields. On the other hand, the anomaly at T_{N} ~ 2.4 K is quickly suppressed by a low field. The entropy change associated with the magnetic transitions deduced from the specific heat of Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+ by subtracting the data from Pb2Sr2TcCu3O8+ up to T ~ 12 K is about 5.8 J/mol K (~ R ln2), indicative of a doublet ground state for Tb in the crystalline electric fields. In addition, the magnetic specific heat far below the transitions has the form C_{N}(_T_) = _AT_2 + B /_T_2, suggesting contributions from two-dimensional magnon and nuclear Schottky, respectively. These results are discussed in comparison to those of related compounds, such as R Ba2Cu3O7 and Pb2Sr2RCu3O8+.

Since the high-_T__c_ superconductor La2-_x_Ba_x_CuO4 was discovered,1 many other high-_T__c_ superconductors with modified perovskite structures have been found. Almost all these copper oxide high-_T__c_ superconductors have a similar fundamental structure consisting of conducting CuO2 plane layers and intercalated layers known as the charge reservoir. These insulating compounds become metallic and superconducting by the way of charge transfer from the reservoir to the CuO2 plane layers and the T_{e} depends on the hole concentration in the CuO2 plane. Recently Cava _et al._2 and Subramanian _et al._3 reported the existence of bulk superconductivity in Pb2Sr2(_R_,Ca)Cu3O8+ (_R_ = rare earth) and the crystal structure of these compounds is orthorhombic. The samples without Ca doping are insulators but become superconducting with partial Ca substitution for the rare earths.3 As for Pb2Sr2Y1-_x_CaCu3O8+, it shows a variation of T_{e} in x with a maximum of T_{c} ~ 70 K for x = 0.5.4 This series has received a great deal of attention because of its closely related structure to that of _R_Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ (_R_ = rare earths) except that the CuO chain is replaced by the PbO-CuO8-PbO triple-layered block.5 Chailout _et al._ deduced from single-crystal neutron diffraction that the charge transfer takes place from (Y,Ca) layers to the CuO2 layers in Pb2Sr2(Y,Ca)Cu3O8+ with respect to the route mentioned above, such as in YBa2Cu3O8+ the charge transfer from the chain Cu to the planar ones.6 It should be pointed that single-phase TbBa2Cu3O7-_d_ cannot be synthesized with the traditional solid-state-reaction methods because of the existence of stable impurity phases of TbBaO3 and BaCuO2,7 while Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+ is one of the very few Tb-containing cuprates. Preliminary results8,9 have indicated that the magnetic ordering temperature (T_{N}) for Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+ is about 5.5 K, which is lower than that of PrBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (T_{N} ~ 17 K) (Ref. 10) and Pb2Sr2PtCu3O8+ (T_{N} ~ 8.5 K) (Ref. 8) but higher than that of other corresponding magnetic rare-earth cuprates, such as GdBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (T_{N} ~ 2.2 K) (Ref. 11) and Pb2Sr2GdCu3O8+_d_ (T_{N} ~ 2.4 K).8 Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate the magnetic order of Tb in Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+ and compare the similarities and differences with Pr, Gd, and other rare-earth-based cuprates. In this paper we report the results of the specific-heat and magnetic-susceptibility measurements on Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+ and compare the results to the related compounds R Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ and Pb2Sr2RCu3O8+.

The details of sample preparation, characterization, and dc magnetic-susceptibility measurements were described elsewhere.8 Ac magnetic-susceptibility data were taken in a low frequency (~ 20 Hz) and at a low field (~ 2 Oe) on a powder sample. The specific heat of pieces (~ 5 mg) cut from the samples was measured in the range of 0.5-12 K with a 3He relaxation calorimeter using the heat-pulse technique12 at fields of 0, 2, and 4 T. The samples were attached to a sapphire chip, which has two separated silicon films deposited on it to serve as the heater and thermometer. The Si-film thermometer was calibrated against a calibrated germanium thermometer. For measurements in magnetic fields, a calibrated capacitance sensor was used to calibrate the thermometer. For each point of the specific-heat measurements, a small heat power was introduced to the chip and the thermal relaxation was measured and analyzed to obtain the specific heat of the samples.

Figure 1 shows the low-temperature specific heat for Pb_{2}Sr_{2}YCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} without magnetic field and Pb_{2}Sr_{2}TbCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} with fields of 0, 2, and 4 T. The shape of the specific heat for Pb_{2}Sr_{2}TbCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} is more similar to the Gd-containing cuprates than to the Pr-containing ones. In zero field, the specific heat of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}TbCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} decreases parallel with that of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}YCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} down to 8 K and then starts to deviate from the smooth curve. The clear \lambda-like specific heat is formed with a sharp peak at 5.3 K marked by T_{N1}. The anomaly at 5.3 K in the specific heat for Pb_{2}Sr_{2}TbCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} corresponding to the Tb antiferromagnetic order is consistent with the previous magnetic-susceptibility study.[8] With decreasing temperature there is another peak at 2.4 K marked by T_{N2} whose magnitude is much smaller than that at 5.3 K. This compound does not contain Ba constituent and no extra peak in the x-ray-diffraction pattern is detected within our instrument resolution. Thus, it reduces the possibility that the magnetic transition at 2.4 K is due to impurity phases (such as TbBaO_{3}). It is noted that the anomaly at 2.4 K can be reproduced in samples from different batches and is also evidenced by the ac susceptibility measurement with a 2-Oe magnetic field as shown in the inset of Fig. 2. Therefore, this anomaly may be attributed to another antiferromagnetic ordering structure in analogy with the observation in the intermetallic ternary compound Tb_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5}.[13] It is noted that the anomaly at 2.4 K is totally suppressed by field of 2 T in specific heat (Fig. 1) or not seen in the dc magnetic susceptibility (Fig. 2). This suggests that the anomaly at 2.4 K may be associated with a weak magnetic order such as spin reorientation or short-range magnetic order, which can be easily destroyed by applying a large magnetic field. The specific heat above the ordering temperature increased with field is similar to PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Ref. [14]), but is different from DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} in which the specific heat above ordering temperature is suppressed with field.[15] The ordering temperature T_{N1} at 5.3 K shows little change with field both in specific heat (Fig. 1) and dc magnetic-susceptibility data (Fig. 2). This is similar to the magnetic-susceptibility results for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Ref. [10]) and Pb_{2}Sr_{2}PrCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} (Ref. [16]) but dissimilar for DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Ref. [15]) and GdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Ref. [17]) in which the T_{N} is lowered by the applied fields.

Figure 3 shows the magnetic specific heat C_{M} of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}TbCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} by subtracting the specific heat of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}YCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} as the background assuming the same lattice and electronic contributions to specific heat for these two compounds. The magnetic entropy change, estimated from \Delta S_{M}(T)=\int C_{M}(T)/TdT, up to 12 K is about 5.8 J/mol K, which is close to R ln2 (5.76 J/mol K), suggesting a doublet ground state. A previous susceptibility measurement[8] showed that \mu_{\rm eff} of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}TbCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} is about 10.04\mu_{B}, close to 9.72\mu_{B}, indicative of Tb^{+3}. In comparison the entropy change for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} is about 5 J/mol K, which is smaller than the expected entropy change due to the ordering of a crystalline electric-field doublet ground state. This has been used to argue for the mixed valence for the Pr

  state.[18] The \mu_{\rm eff} and entropy change for other related compounds are listed in Table 1 for comparison. The upturn in C_{M}/T below 0.9 K (Fig. 3) is associated with a nuclear Schottky anomaly similar to the observation in many other cuprates.[19] In the temperature range far below transition at T_{N1} the magnetic contribution to specific heat can be described by a power law C_{M}=AT^{2}+B/T^{2}, where the first term is a characteristic of two-dimensional (2D) magnons and the second term is the property of nuclear Schottky anomaly. Figure 4 shows the fitting results as well as the values of A and B for Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+6 with fields of 0, 2, and 4 T. In curve 4(a), the data can be fit only in the temperature range of 0.6-1.8 K and the fitting curve starts to deviate from the data points above 1.8 K due to the anomaly at T_{N2}. In curves 4(b) and (c), the anomaly at T_{N2} is suppressed by magnetic fields and the data points can be fit up to 5.1 and 4.2 K, respectively. Apart from the zero-field data, the A decreases with fields suggesting that the magnetic order is antiferromagnetic in nature; while the B increases with fields confirming the existence of the nuclear Schottky effect. These results are consistent with the neutron-diffraction study that the antiferromagnetic order of Tb in Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+6 is a 2D dominant process with the nearest-neighbor spins in the basal plane antiparallel.[9]

The magnetic ordering temperatures for GdBa2Cu3O7-8, PrBa2Cu3O7-8, Pb2Sr2GdCu3O8+6, and Pb2Sr2PrCu3O8+6 are summarized in Table 1. The suppression of T_{N} for Pb2Sr2PrCu3O8+6 in comparison to that for PrBa2Cu3O7-8 may be due to the PbO-_CuO_8-PbO block causing a longer Pr-Pr distance along the c axis than that for PrBa2Cu3O7-8. In PrBa2Cu3O7-8, this shorter Pr-Pr distance permits one to mediate magnetic correlation along c axis, forming the 3D magnetic ordered structure for the Pr ions.[19, 20] For GdBa2Cu3O7-8, a 3D ordering process has been determined by neutron-diffraction experiments;[21] while for Pb2Sr2GdCu3O8+6, the long Gd-Gd distance along the c axis compared to that in the basal plane describes the effective 2D characteristic.[22] The invariance of T_{N} for Gd-containing compounds may be ascribed to a dipole-dipole coupling mechanism for these two compounds.[22, 23] The dipole-dipole exchange interaction for Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+6 can be roughly estimated with the formula U_{d-d}\!-\!4\mu^{2}(1/r_{1}^{3}\!-\!1/r_{2}^{3}), where \mu\!=\!10.04\mu_{B}, r_{1}\!=\!3.84 A, the nearest-neighbor distance and r_{2}\!=\!\sqrt{2}r_{1}\!=\!5.43 A is the second-nearest-neighbor distance. A value of 0.25 meV is obtained corresponding to 2.9 K, which is smaller than the experimentally observed magnetic ordering temperature 5.3 K. Thus, the dipole-dipole exchange interaction seems not to be the main source for Tb-Tb coupling. Also the semiconducting characteristic of Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+8 suggests that there are not enough conduction electrons to mediate the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction. It should be noted that a magnetic transition is also observed at T_{N}\!\sim\!5.5 K in the superconducting (T_{C}\!\sim\!35 K) Tb-containing cuprate TbSr2(Cu2.7Mo0.3)O7-8.[24] This insensitivity of ordering temperature to electrical conductivity also suggests that the RKKY mechanism is unlikely for these Tb-containing cuprates. Finally, a complicated superexchange interaction could be involved in the magnetic order of Tb in Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+6. The Pr ion in these Pr-, Gd-, and Tb-based compounds has the smallest effective

The calculated effective moments of free trivalent ions for Pr, Gd, and Tb are also included for comparison.

  moment, its magnetic ordering temperature is the highest. Although Tb ion has the largest effective moment, its magnetic ordering temperature is lower than that for Pb_{2}Sr_{2}PtCu_{3}O_{8+\delta}, but higher than that for Pb_{2}Sr_{2}GdCu_{3}O_{8+\delta}. The inconsistency between the magnetic ordering temperature and effective moment may be due to an individually anisotropic magnetic coupling mechanism and/or a special route of charge transfer. At this point, the theoretical study may be helpful for clarifying their relationships.

In summary, the antiferromagnetic order of Tb in Pb_{2}Sr_{2}TbCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} at T_{N1}\sim 5.3 K observed by specific-heat measurements is consistent with the magnetic-susceptibility results which is higher than that of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}GdCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} at T_{N}\sim 2.3 K and lower than that of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}PtCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} at T_{N}\sim 8.5 K. The magnitude of the specific-heat anomaly is suppressed with magnetic field, while the field has only little effect on T_{N1}. There is another smaller anomaly at T_{N2}\sim 2.4 K which may be due to a weak magnetic order or spin reorientation, which is suppressed easily by a magnetic field. The entropy associated with magnetic transitions is about R ln2, suggestive of a doublet ground state for Tb. The magnetic contribution to the specific heat well below the ordering temperature can be described by C_{M}(T)=AT^{2}+B/T^{2}, which is consistent with the observation of the 2D spin structure by neutron-diffraction experiments. A complicated superexchange interaction is proposed for the magnetic order of Tb in Pb_{2}Sr_{2}TbCu_{3}O_{8+\delta}.

###### Abstract

The magnetic-field dependence of the specific-heat measurements on Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+ with 0.5 K < T < 30 K, are reported in order to study the magnetic order in this compound. Anomalies in the specific heat _C_(_T_) of Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+ are observed at T_{N} ~ 5.3 K and T_{N} ~ 2.4 K, which are related to two antiferromagnetic transitions in the Tb sublattice. While the anomaly seen in the specific heat as well as in the magnetic susceptibility at T_{N} ~ 5.3 K is suppressed, the peak position is unaffected with increasing magnetic fields. On the other hand, the anomaly at T_{N} ~ 2.4 K is quickly suppressed by a low field. The entropy change associated with the magnetic transitions deduced from the specific heat of Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+ by subtracting the data from Pb2Sr2TcCu3O8+ up to T ~ 12 K is about 5.8 J/mol K (~ R ln2), indicative of a doublet ground state for Tb in the crystalline electric fields. In addition, the magnetic specific heat far below the transitions has the form C_{N}(_T_) = _AT_2 + B /_T_2, suggesting contributions from two-dimensional magnon and nuclear Schottky, respectively. These results are discussed in comparison to those of related compounds, such as R Ba2Cu3O7 and Pb2Sr2RCu3O8+.

Since the high-_T__c_ superconductor La2-_x_Ba_x_CuO4 was discovered,1 many other high-_T__c_ superconductors with modified perovskite structures have been found. Almost all these copper oxide high-_T__c_ superconductors have a similar fundamental structure consisting of conducting CuO2 plane layers and intercalated layers known as the charge reservoir. These insulating compounds become metallic and superconducting by the way of charge transfer from the reservoir to the CuO2 plane layers and the T_{e} depends on the hole concentration in the CuO2 plane. Recently Cava _et al._2 and Subramanian _et al._3 reported the existence of bulk superconductivity in Pb2Sr2(_R_,Ca)Cu3O8+ (_R_ = rare earth) and the crystal structure of these compounds is orthorhombic. The samples without Ca doping are insulators but become superconducting with partial Ca substitution for the rare earths.3 As for Pb2Sr2Y1-_x_CaCu3O8+, it shows a variation of T_{e} in x with a maximum of T_{c} ~ 70 K for x = 0.5.4 This series has received a great deal of attention because of its closely related structure to that of _R_Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ (_R_ = rare earths) except that the CuO chain is replaced by the PbO-CuO8-PbO triple-layered block.5 Chailout _et al._ deduced from single-crystal neutron diffraction that the charge transfer takes place from (Y,Ca) layers to the CuO2 layers in Pb2Sr2(Y,Ca)Cu3O8+ with respect to the route mentioned above, such as in YBa2Cu3O8+ the charge transfer from the chain Cu to the planar ones.6 It should be pointed that single-phase TbBa2Cu3O7-_d_ cannot be synthesized with the traditional solid-state-reaction methods because of the existence of stable impurity phases of TbBaO3 and BaCuO2,7 while Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+ is one of the very few Tb-containing cuprates. Preliminary results8,9 have indicated that the magnetic ordering temperature (T_{N}) for Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+ is about 5.5 K, which is lower than that of PrBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (T_{N} ~ 17 K) (Ref. 10) and Pb2Sr2PtCu3O8+ (T_{N} ~ 8.5 K) (Ref. 8) but higher than that of other corresponding magnetic rare-earth cuprates, such as GdBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (T_{N} ~ 2.2 K) (Ref. 11) and Pb2Sr2GdCu3O8+_d_ (T_{N} ~ 2.4 K).8 Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate the magnetic order of Tb in Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+ and compare the similarities and differences with Pr, Gd, and other rare-earth-based cuprates. In this paper we report the results of the specific-heat and magnetic-susceptibility measurements on Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+ and compare the results to the related compounds R Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ and Pb2Sr2RCu3O8+.

The details of sample preparation, characterization, and dc magnetic-susceptibility measurements were described elsewhere.8 Ac magnetic-susceptibility data were taken in a low frequency (~ 20 Hz) and at a low field (~ 2 Oe) on a powder sample. The specific heat of pieces (~ 5 mg) cut from the samples was measured in the range of 0.5-12 K with a 3He relaxation calorimeter using the heat-pulse technique12 at fields of 0, 2, and 4 T. The samples were attached to a sapphire chip, which has two separated silicon films deposited on it to serve as the heater and thermometer. The Si-film thermometer was calibrated against a calibrated germanium thermometer. For measurements in magnetic fields, a calibrated capacitance sensor was used to calibrate the thermometer. For each point of the specific-heat measurements, a small heat power was introduced to the chip and the thermal relaxation was measured and analyzed to obtain the specific heat of the samples.

Figure 1 shows the low-temperature specific heat for Pb_{2}Sr_{2}YCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} without magnetic field and Pb_{2}Sr_{2}TbCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} with fields of 0, 2, and 4 T. The shape of the specific heat for Pb_{2}Sr_{2}TbCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} is more similar to the Gd-containing cuprates than to the Pr-containing ones. In zero field, the specific heat of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}TbCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} decreases parallel with that of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}YCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} down to 8 K and then starts to deviate from the smooth curve. The clear \lambda-like specific heat is formed with a sharp peak at 5.3 K marked by T_{N1}. The anomaly at 5.3 K in the specific heat for Pb_{2}Sr_{2}TbCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} corresponding to the Tb antiferromagnetic order is consistent with the previous magnetic-susceptibility study.[8] With decreasing temperature there is another peak at 2.4 K marked by T_{N2} whose magnitude is much smaller than that at 5.3 K. This compound does not contain Ba constituent and no extra peak in the x-ray-diffraction pattern is detected within our instrument resolution. Thus, it reduces the possibility that the magnetic transition at 2.4 K is due to impurity phases (such as TbBaO_{3}). It is noted that the anomaly at 2.4 K can be reproduced in samples from different batches and is also evidenced by the ac susceptibility measurement with a 2-Oe magnetic field as shown in the inset of Fig. 2. Therefore, this anomaly may be attributed to another antiferromagnetic ordering structure in analogy with the observation in the intermetallic ternary compound Tb_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5}.[13] It is noted that the anomaly at 2.4 K is totally suppressed by field of 2 T in specific heat (Fig. 1) or not seen in the dc magnetic susceptibility (Fig. 2). This suggests that the anomaly at 2.4 K may be associated with a weak magnetic order such as spin reorientation or short-range magnetic order, which can be easily destroyed by applying a large magnetic field. The specific heat above the ordering temperature increased with field is similar to PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Ref. [14]), but is different from DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} in which the specific heat above ordering temperature is suppressed with field.[15] The ordering temperature T_{N1} at 5.3 K shows little change with field both in specific heat (Fig. 1) and dc magnetic-susceptibility data (Fig. 2). This is similar to the magnetic-susceptibility results for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Ref. [10]) and Pb_{2}Sr_{2}PrCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} (Ref. [16]) but dissimilar for DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Ref. [15]) and GdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Ref. [17]) in which the T_{N} is lowered by the applied fields.

Figure 3 shows the magnetic specific heat C_{M} of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}TbCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} by subtracting the specific heat of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}YCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} as the background assuming the same lattice and electronic contributions to specific heat for these two compounds. The magnetic entropy change, estimated from \Delta S_{M}(T)=\int C_{M}(T)/TdT, up to 12 K is about 5.8 J/mol K, which is close to R ln2 (5.76 J/mol K), suggesting a doublet ground state. A previous susceptibility measurement[8] showed that \mu_{\rm eff} of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}TbCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} is about 10.04\mu_{B}, close to 9.72\mu_{B}, indicative of Tb^{+3}. In comparison the entropy change for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} is about 5 J/mol K, which is smaller than the expected entropy change due to the ordering of a crystalline electric-field doublet ground state. This has been used to argue for the mixed valence for the Pr

  state.[18] The \mu_{\rm eff} and entropy change for other related compounds are listed in Table 1 for comparison. The upturn in C_{M}/T below 0.9 K (Fig. 3) is associated with a nuclear Schottky anomaly similar to the observation in many other cuprates.[19] In the temperature range far below transition at T_{N1} the magnetic contribution to specific heat can be described by a power law C_{M}=AT^{2}+B/T^{2}, where the first term is a characteristic of two-dimensional (2D) magnons and the second term is the property of nuclear Schottky anomaly. Figure 4 shows the fitting results as well as the values of A and B for Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+6 with fields of 0, 2, and 4 T. In curve 4(a), the data can be fit only in the temperature range of 0.6-1.8 K and the fitting curve starts to deviate from the data points above 1.8 K due to the anomaly at T_{N2}. In curves 4(b) and (c), the anomaly at T_{N2} is suppressed by magnetic fields and the data points can be fit up to 5.1 and 4.2 K, respectively. Apart from the zero-field data, the A decreases with fields suggesting that the magnetic order is antiferromagnetic in nature; while the B increases with fields confirming the existence of the nuclear Schottky effect. These results are consistent with the neutron-diffraction study that the antiferromagnetic order of Tb in Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+6 is a 2D dominant process with the nearest-neighbor spins in the basal plane antiparallel.[9]

The magnetic ordering temperatures for GdBa2Cu3O7-8, PrBa2Cu3O7-8, Pb2Sr2GdCu3O8+6, and Pb2Sr2PrCu3O8+6 are summarized in Table 1. The suppression of T_{N} for Pb2Sr2PrCu3O8+6 in comparison to that for PrBa2Cu3O7-8 may be due to the PbO-_CuO_8-PbO block causing a longer Pr-Pr distance along the c axis than that for PrBa2Cu3O7-8. In PrBa2Cu3O7-8, this shorter Pr-Pr distance permits one to mediate magnetic correlation along c axis, forming the 3D magnetic ordered structure for the Pr ions.[19, 20] For GdBa2Cu3O7-8, a 3D ordering process has been determined by neutron-diffraction experiments;[21] while for Pb2Sr2GdCu3O8+6, the long Gd-Gd distance along the c axis compared to that in the basal plane describes the effective 2D characteristic.[22] The invariance of T_{N} for Gd-containing compounds may be ascribed to a dipole-dipole coupling mechanism for these two compounds.[22, 23] The dipole-dipole exchange interaction for Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+6 can be roughly estimated with the formula U_{d-d}\!-\!4\mu^{2}(1/r_{1}^{3}\!-\!1/r_{2}^{3}), where \mu\!=\!10.04\mu_{B}, r_{1}\!=\!3.84 A, the nearest-neighbor distance and r_{2}\!=\!\sqrt{2}r_{1}\!=\!5.43 A is the second-nearest-neighbor distance. A value of 0.25 meV is obtained corresponding to 2.9 K, which is smaller than the experimentally observed magnetic ordering temperature 5.3 K. Thus, the dipole-dipole exchange interaction seems not to be the main source for Tb-Tb coupling. Also the semiconducting characteristic of Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+8 suggests that there are not enough conduction electrons to mediate the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction. It should be noted that a magnetic transition is also observed at T_{N}\!\sim\!5.5 K in the superconducting (T_{C}\!\sim\!35 K) Tb-containing cuprate TbSr2(Cu2.7Mo0.3)O7-8.[24] This insensitivity of ordering temperature to electrical conductivity also suggests that the RKKY mechanism is unlikely for these Tb-containing cuprates. Finally, a complicated superexchange interaction could be involved in the magnetic order of Tb in Pb2Sr2TbCu3O8+6. The Pr ion in these Pr-, Gd-, and Tb-based compounds has the smallest effective

  moment, its magnetic ordering temperature is the highest. Although Tb ion has the largest effective moment, its magnetic ordering temperature is lower than that for Pb_{2}Sr_{2}PtCu_{3}O_{8+\delta}, but higher than that for Pb_{2}Sr_{2}GdCu_{3}O_{8+\delta}. The inconsistency between the magnetic ordering temperature and effective moment may be due to an individually anisotropic magnetic coupling mechanism and/or a special route of charge transfer. At this point, the theoretical study may be helpful for clarifying their relationships.

In summary, the antiferromagnetic order of Tb in Pb_{2}Sr_{2}TbCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} at T_{N1}\sim 5.3 K observed by specific-heat measurements is consistent with the magnetic-susceptibility results which is higher than that of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}GdCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} at T_{N}\sim 2.3 K and lower than that of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}PtCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} at T_{N}\sim 8.5 K. The magnitude of the specific-heat anomaly is suppressed with magnetic field, while the field has only little effect on T_{N1}. There is another smaller anomaly at T_{N2}\sim 2.4 K which may be due to a weak magnetic order or spin reorientation, which is suppressed easily by a magnetic field. The entropy associated with magnetic transitions is about R ln2, suggestive of a doublet ground state for Tb. The magnetic contribution to the specific heat well below the ordering temperature can be described by C_{M}(T)=AT^{2}+B/T^{2}, which is consistent with the observation of the 2D spin structure by neutron-diffraction experiments. A complicated superexchange interaction is proposed for the magnetic order of Tb in Pb_{2}Sr_{2}TbCu_{3}O_{8+\delta}.
