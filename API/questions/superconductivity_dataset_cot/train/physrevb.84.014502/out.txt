###### Abstract

In this paper, we perform Fe-site substitution experiments on K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} superconductor by choosing Cr, Mn, Co, and Zn as dopants. It is found that the doping of Cr, Co, and Zn leads to a drastic depression of superconductivity, while the introduction of Mn does not decrease the superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) when x\leqslant 0.067. Electron-spin-resonance measurements reveal the existence of strong magnetic fluctuation in both the parent compound and the doped samples. In the Cr-, Co-, and Zn-doped samples, the magnetic pair-breaking effect severely affects the superconductivity, resulting in drastic depression of superconductivity. On the other hand, in the Mn-doped case, it does not break the cooper pairs and thus hardly affects the T_{c} value.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in FeAs-based systems has sparked great interests in the condensed matter physics community [1, 2, 3] because the comparison between the FeAs-based superconductors and the cuprate superconductors may help to solve the question of the high-temperature superconducting mechanism. However, large difference has been found between these two classes of high-temperature superconductors. For example, the parent compound of the FeAs-based systems is bad metal, whereas it is Mott insulator for the cuprate systems. The FeAs-based superconductors generally exhibit a complicated spin-density-wave transition, while there is no such transition in the Cu-based compounds. More importantly, it has been experimentally and theoretically proven that the predominant pairing symmetry of the cuprate superconductors is d-wave pairing, while there is strong evidence that the possible pairing symmetry is s^{\pm} wave in the iron-arsenic superconductors. [45]

Recently, superconductivity with T_{c} up to 32 K has been reported in A_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} (A = K, Rb, Cs, and Tl, AFSe-122 type). [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 5  K_{a} radiation at room temperature. The actual composition of the crystal was determined using energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometry (EDX). The resistivity was measured using a standard four-probe method. Magnetic properties were investigated using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. The electron-spin-resonance (ESR) measurements were performed at 9.40 GHz using a BRUKER EMXplus 10112 spectrometer equipped with a continuous He gas-flow cryostat in the temperature region of 2-300 K by sweeping magnetic field parallel to the _ab_ plane.

## III Results and Discussion

First of all, we would like to know whether or not the selected dopants are really incorporated into the K0.8Fe2-,Se2 lattice. In order to determine the real compositions of the crystals, we performed energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometry analysis on the Cr-, Mn-, Co-, and Zn-doped K0.8Fe2-,Se2 samples. The comparison between nominal and real compositions of several representative K0.8Fe2-, M_{x}Se2 (M= Cr, Mn, Co, and Zn) samples is listed in Table 1. It is found that the Mn atoms can be incorporated into the system easily at low-doping level. That is, the real Mn content is almost the same as the nominal concentration when x\leqslant 5%. However, When x>5%, it is difficult to incorporate more Mn into the lattice. For example, the real Mn content is 0.067 in the sample with nominal Mn concentration of 0.10. For the other dopants, we find that the Cr, Co, and Zn atoms have much smaller solubility comparing to Mn. For example, for the sample with nominal Cr doping concentration 5%, it shows that the real Cr content in the single crystal is only about 0.015. And the actual Cr content is about 0.024 in the sample with nominal Cr concentration of 0.10. For the Co-and Zn-doped samples, similar behavior was also found. These results are completely different from the case of doped BaFe2-,As2. In the latter case, the transition metals, such as Co, Cr, Mn, Zn, etc., can be easily introduced into the BaFe2-As2 lattice with high doping content.12-14

Large-size plate-like single crystals with dimensions up to 6\times 5\times 2 mm3 can be grown. A picture of the as-grown K0.8Fe2-,Se2 single crystal is shown in Fig. 1(a). In order to check the quality of the single-crystal samples, we perform single-crystal XRD measurements and the representative single-crystal XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 1(a) (the red curve). Only the (00_l_) diffraction peaks with even l are observed, confirming that the crystallographic c axis is perpendicular to the shining surface. For all the diffraction peaks, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is less than 0.06^{\circ}, indicating the high quality of the samples. It should be noted that there is another series of (00_l_) peaks (marked by the asterisks), which are located in a lower angle of the main peaks of the K0.8Fe2-,Se2 parent sample, implying that there might be a modulation structure along c axis. The existence of modulation structure in the K0.8Fe2-,Se2 sample has been confirmed by neutron diffraction and single-crystal XRD measurements, transmission electron microscopy measurement, and other experiments.15-17 Figure 1(a) gives the powder XRD pattern of the Co-doped K0.8Fe2-,Se2 samples. All the diffraction peaks can be indexed using the space group of 14/mmm with no unidentified peaks. The lattice parameters for the parent compound are a=3.9106 A and c=14.0663 A, which are similar to previous reported values.6 Figures 1(b) and 1(c) give the a axis and c axis lattice constants as the function of transition-metal doping content (_x_), respectively. From Fig. 1(b), we find that the a axis lattice parameter slightly increases with increasing Cr, Mn, and Co doping content, while it decreases in the Zn-doped samples. For the c axis constant, it decreases monotonously with increasing transition-metal doping content.

Figures 2(a)-2(d) give the temperature dependence of inelastic resistivity of K0.8Fe2-,-Zr,Se2, K0.8Fe2-,-Mn,Se2, K0.8Fe2-,-x-Co,Se2, and K0.8Fe2-,-Zn,Se2, respectively. At high temperature, the resistivity of the parent compound, K0.8Fe2-,Se2, increases with decreasing temperature and exhibits a broad hump at about 115 K. With further cooling, metallic transport behavior appears and the superconductivity occurs at T_{c}^{\rm onset}\sim 30.5 K. The superconducting transition width, \Delta T_{c}, is less than 2 K, indicating very high quality of the single crystal. A striking difference among the Cr-, Mn-, Co-, and Zn-doping samples is that the doping of Co and Mn leads to the shift of the resistance hump in the \rho\simT curve toward higher temperature, while the doping of Cr and Zn leads to the shift toward low temperature. We also notice that the doping exhibits different response of superconductivity on the transition-metal impurities for the Cr-, Co-, Zn-, and Mn-doped samples. The plot of the _T_c versus doping content x for each doping element is shown in Fig. 3(a). One can see that the _T_c value decreases nearly linearly with increasing x for K0.8Fe2-,-x-Zr,Se2 and K0.8Fe2-,-Ca0.8Fe2. For the K0.8Fe2-,-x-Zn,Se2 series, the superconductivity is completely depressed with only 0.5% doping of Zn, indicating that Zn impurity suppresses the superconductivity more violently. For the K0.8Fe2-,-x-Mn,Se2 series, the situation is completely different. The doping of Mn does not decrease the _T_c of the samples at all.

Figure 4 gives the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility of the K0.8Fe2-,-y-,M_x_ Se2 (M= Cr, Mn, Co, and Zn) near the superconducting transition temperature. Strong diamagnetic signal is detected below T_{c}\sim 30.5 K in the K0.8Fe2-,Se2 sample, which is consistent with the resistivity results. In the inset of Fig. 4(a), the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility of the K0.8Fe2-,-Se2 under both zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) conditions is given. One can see that the magnetic transition to the Meissner state is

  very broad, suggesting that the sample is not in uniform superconducting state. The rather wide \Delta T_{c} detected from magnetic susceptibility indicates the existence of vortex pinning that could be due to the K and Fe deficiency. From Figs. 4(a) and 4(c), we notice that both the superconducting transition temperature and the superconducting volume fraction decrease severely with increasing doping content in the Cr-and Co-doped samples. The superconductivity disappears completely when the real doping concentration is higher than x=0.01 for Cr and x=0.018 for Co doping. For the Zn-doped samples, the superconducting volume fraction is nearly zero in the x=0.005 sample, suggesting that the Zn dopants depress the superconductivity more violently. The magnetic-susceptibility results are nicely consistent with the resistivity data. For the Mn-doped samples, though the superconducting volume fraction decreases monotonously with increasing Mn doping, the superconducting transition temperature keeps unchanged. The decrease of superconducting volume fraction is understandable if we consider that there are certain nonsuperconducting islands around the Mn dopants.

Figure 5 plots the temperature dependence of magnetization of the Cr-, Mn-, Co-, and Zn-doped samples at high temperature. The normal-state magnetic susceptibility for the parent compound, K0.8Fe2_{2-y}Se2, decreases slightly with decreasing temperature below \sim300 K, which is consistent with the AFM state (the T_{N} is about 559 K in K0.8Fe2_{2-y}Se2 sample [15]). For all the K0.8Fe2_{2-y-x}M_{x}Se2, the introduction of transition-metal dopants leads to an increase of magnetization, both in the magnetic-ion-doped samples and in the nonmagnetic-ion-doped samples. In a simple Curie's law picture, the magnetic susceptibility in a sample at a certain temperature is proportional to the effective magnetic moment of the magnetic ions. Thus the gradual increase of magnetic susceptibility in the transition-metal-doped samples suggests that both the magnetic and the nonmagnetic ions induce effective magnetic moments in the system. For the Cr-doped samples, the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility exhibits a strange hump near 100 K. In the inset of Fig. 5(a), we show the comparison of the magnetization measured under ZFC condition and FC conditions for the x=0.024 sample. It shows that the FC curve does not coincide with ZFC curve below \sim140 K, which is a characteristic of cluster glass that has no simple long-range magnetic order. [18] The origin of the cluster-glass behavior is not clear. A possible origin is some small-size ferromagnetic impurities induced by Cr dopants. For the Mn-doped case, the increase of magnetization is rather small, implying that Mn ions rarely affect the magnetic property of the K0.8Fe2_{2-y}Se2 system. In other words, the doping of Mn introduces a small effective magnetic moment in the system. For the Co-and Zn-doped cases, the increase of magnetic susceptibility is significantly larger than that in the Mn-doped samples.

  It should be noted that the nonmagnetic Zn ions do not carry moments and thus do not introduce magnetic moments in conventional superconductors. Thus the substantial increase of magnetic susceptibility by Zn-doping is interesting. The introduction of magnetic moments in Zn-doped K_{0.8}Fe_{2-\gamma-}Se_{2} is similar to a previous study in a cuprate superconductor, where the doping of Zn in high-T_{c} cuprate La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4} induces 1.2 \mu_{B}/Zn moment.[19] The formation of magnetic moment due to the impurities is directly related to the response of Fe-Se tetrahedron to a local perturbation. For the nonmagnetic Zn dopant, the result of doping is to locally remove the spin of Fe^{2+} and break the AFM magnetic fluctuation. In this way, the magnetic moments of neighboring Fe ions may change accordingly. Since both the magnetic (such as Cr and Co) and nonmagnetic ions (Zn) introduce large effective magnetic moment into the system, it is possible that the magnetic pair-breaking effect destroys the superconductivity. For the Mn-doped sample, much less effective moment is introduced, thus it hardly affect the superconducting transition temperature.

In a conventional s-wave superconductor, magnetic impurities are extremely harmful to the cooper-pairs due to the strong scattering of the impurity spins on the conduction electrons, while nonmagnetic impurities will not lead to apparent pair-breaking effects. On the other hand, for high-temperature superconductors with d-wave symmetry of the order parameter modulated in k space, the assumption of uniform order parameter has already been broken for a clean system. As a consequence, the nonmagnetic impurities mixing wave vectors k of the paring potential \Delta_{k} act on the superconductivity in a similar way as the magnetic ones, leading to a pair-breaking effect.[19, 20, 21] According to the Abrikosov-Gork'ov theory,[22] if the impurities act as strong pair breakers, the depression of T_{c} due to the pair-breaking effect is related to the impurity scattering rate K_{B}\Delta T_{c}\approx\pi\hbar/8\tau_{\rm imp}\propto\rho_{0}, where \tau_{\rm imp} is the quasiparticle lifetime of the impurity and \rho_{0} is the residual resistivity. Therefore, we plot the doping dependence of residual resistivity \rho_{0} for each transition-metal impurity in Fig. 3(b). It is apparent that Zn doping results in a very rapid increase of \rho_{0}. This reasonably leads to the most violent  depression of superconductivity. On the other hand, Mn doping only leads to very weak change in \rho_{0}, implying that the impurity scattering induced by Mn-doping is, in principle, small-angle scattering or small-momentum transfer. Thus Mn doping hardly suppresses T_{c}. For the Cr- and Co-doping samples, the increase of \rho_{0} is moderate but apparent, then the depression of superconductivity is stronger than that in Mn-doped samples, but weaker than the Zn-doped case.

In order to investigate the influence of the transition-metal dopants on the magnetic state of the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} system in detail, we perform ESR measurements on the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} parent superconductor and the doped K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y\to x}M_{x}Se_{2} (M = Cr, Mn, Co, Zn) samples. ESR has been shown to be a highly sensitive tool to study the magnetic fluctuations and magnetic interactions in cuprate superconductors and their parent compounds.[23] For the iron-based superconductors where the role of magnetic fluctuation on the superconductivity is highly debatable, ESR may give us some information on this issue. In the ESR measurement, microwave radiation with fixed frequency (\upsilon=9.4 GHz in our instrument) enters the sample cavity and the external magnetic field is swept from 0 to 8000 Oe. In the simplest case, ESR will occur when

\[h\upsilon=g\mu_{B}H,\] (1)

where h is the Planck constant, g is the electron so-called Lande g factor, \mu_{B} is the Bohr magneton, and H is the applied magnetic field. The g factor for the unpaired electrons is g_{e} = 2.0023. According to Eq. (1), the resonance field H_{\rm res} should be located at H_{\rm res}\sim 3330 Oe for unpaired electrons if there is no internal interaction. The ESR spectra of K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} superconductor from 2 to 300 K is shown in Fig. 6(a). Below T_{c}, the ESR spectra exhibits a diplike signal at low-field region, which is due to the magnetic shielding below the lower critical field H_{\rm c1}\approx 70 Oe. At high temperature, the ESR spectra shows a single exchange-narrowed resonance line, which is well described by a Dyson shape, i.e., a Lorentz line at resonance field H_{\rm res}.[24] The H_{\rm res} value is 3313 Oe at 300 K, which is very close to 3330 Oe. With decreasing temperature, the resonance field exhibits a slight shift to a lower field. The temperature dependence of H_{\rm res} is shown in Fig. 6(b). The low-field shift of H_{\rm res} may originate from the formation of ferromagnetic interactions or the change in crystal field. Since the crystallographic study of the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} crystal does not show any change in crystal structure, the change in crystal field should be very little. Thus the low-field shift of H_{\rm res} suggests the formation of a certain kind of ferromagnetic interactions in the sample, similar to that in colossal magnetoresistance materials.[25] If there are some ferromagnetic interactions, the effective magnetic field H_{\rm eff} around the unpaired electrons can be written as

\[H_{\rm eff}=H_{\rm ext}+H_{\rm exchange}+H_{\rm dipole}+H_{\rm demag }+H_{\rm anisotropic}+\ldots\] (2)

where H_{\rm ext} is the applied magnetic field, H_{\rm exchange} is the contribution from exchange interaction of electron spins, H_{\rm dipole} is the contribution of small-size magnetic clusters, H_{\rm demag} comes from the demagnetization factor, and H_{\rm anisotropic} is the effective magneto-crystalline anisotropy field. If some ferromagnetic interactions exist, the terms H_{\rm exchange}, H_{\rm dipole}, H_{\rm demag}, and H_{\rm anisotropic} plus the rest "\ldots" can provide a positive effective magnetic field around the electrons. In this case, the external magnetic field needed for the occurrence of resonance should be less than 3330 Oe.

From Fig. 6(a), we also notice that the intensity of the resonant absorption (defined as the height between the top and the bottom of the spectra) gradually decreases with decreasing temperature. In order to see the decrease clearly, we plot in Fig. 6(c) the temperature dependence of relative intensity [I(T)/I(300 K)]. The slight decrease of resonance intensity is consistent with the formation of antiferromagnetic magnetic fluctuation in the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} system.[10; 15] The ESR results are also consistent with the magnetic-susceptibility data shown in Fig. 5 where the normal-state magnetic susceptibility for the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} parent compound decreases slightly with decreasing temperature below 300 K. Another noticeable feature is that the ESR linewidth (\Delta H) broadens at low temperature. The temperature dependence of \Delta H is shown in Fig. 6(d). The ESR linewidth is determined by the spin-lattice relaxation time T_{1}.[24] Thus ESR measurements provide information complementary to nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) experiments. From Fig. 6(d), it can be seen that the ESR linewidth \Delta H increases with decreasing temperature below

Figure 3: (Color online) (a) The plot of the T_{c} value vs x for the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y\to x}M_{x}Se_{2} (M = Cr, Mn, Co, and Zn) samples. (b) The plot of the residual resistivity vs x.

  300 K, indicating a shortening of the spin-lattice relaxation time T_{1}. Below \sim100 K, \Delta_H_ increases rapidly with decreasing temperature, suggesting that the spin-lattice-relaxation time shortens very fast at low temperature, which is consistent with the strong enhancement of magnetic fluctuation. In Ba_{0.72}K_{0.28}Fe_{2}As_{2} superconductor, strong enhancement of magnetic fluctuation below \sim70 K has been discovered by NMR measurements.[26] In K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} superconductor, there is no report on magnetic fluctuation so far. The ESR results give the evidence of strong magnetic fluctuation in this system. There are many experimental and theoretical studies on the magnetic-fluctuation effects in the iron-based superconductors that suggest that the magnetic fluctuation is important for the superconductivity in Fe-based systems.[27, 28, 29, 30] Here, we find that the magnetic fluctuation exists in the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} superconductor. The significant enhancement of magnetic fluctuation below \sim100 K seems to be consistent with the argument that the magnetic fluctuation is important for the superconductivity.

Figure 7 gives the ESR spectra for the Cr-, Mn-, Co-, and Zn-doped samples. It is found that the introduction of transition-metal dopants leads to significant change in the shape of the ESR spectra. In order to investigate the change quantitatively, we plot in Figs. 6(b)-6(d) the comparison of the position of resonance magnetic field, the relative intensity, and the ESR linewidth between the transition-metal-doped and the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} parent samples. From Figs. 6(b)-6(d), one can see that Mn doping induces very little change in the temperature dependence of resonance magnetic field, the relative intensity, and the ESR linewidth compared with the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} parent sample. The relatively small perturbation in the ESR is consistent with the magnetic-susceptibility results where the introduction of Mn only leads to slight increase of magnetic susceptibility. From Fig. 6(b) we notice

(The data are collected under zero-field-cooling condition with external magnetic field of 100 gauss.) In the inset, the comparison of magnetic susceptibility between ZFC condition and FC condition for the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} parent sample is given.

  that the position of the resonance magnetic field in the Cr- and Zn-doped samples is smaller than 3330 Oe at 300 K, indicating that some ferromagnetic interaction might be formed even at high temperature. This is also consistent with the magnetic-susceptibility results where the M\sim T curve does not obey the Curie-Weiss law at high temperature. For the Co-doped sample, it shows that the position of the resonance magnetic field hardly decreases below 100 K, suggesting that the the ferromagnetic interaction is very weak. The temperature dependence of relative intensity shown in Fig. 6(c) suggests that the resonant absorption is much weakened at low temperature in all samples, meaning that the AFM magnetic fluctuation is very strong despite of the introduction of transition-metal impurities. The strong enhancement of magnetic fluctuation is also confirmed by the rapid increase of ESR linewidth \Delta H below \sim100 K [shown in Fig. 6(d)].

In the iron-arsenic superconductors, experiments have revealed that the AFM magnetic fluctuation and the multiband effects are two key factors for driving the system into the superconducting state.[27, 28, 29, 30, 31] These experimental results give partial support to the picture that the pairing may be established via interband scattering of electrons between the hole pockets near \Gamma point and electron pockets around M point, leading to the so-called s^{\pm} pairing mechanism. However, in the A_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} (A = K, Rb, Cs, and Tl) superconductors, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments have revealed the disappearance of the hole-like Fermi-surface sheet around \Gamma point.[11] The ARPES results suggest that interband scattering or Fermi-surface nesting is not a necessary ingredient for the unconventional superconductivity in iron-based superconductors. From the ARPES results, it is suggested that a more conventional s-wave pairing is probably a better description. In this work, we present the investigation on the transport and magnetic properties of the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} system with transition-metal doping at Fe site. The most important result is that the doping of nonmagnetic Zn ions leads to the strongest depression of the superconductivity. This is completely different from that in conventional superconductors where nonmagnetic impurities do not break the cooper pairs. The strong suppression of superconductivity by Zn doping is similar to that in doped cuprates where a strong pair-breaking effect occurs with nonmagnetic-impurity

  doping. The magnetization and ESR results clearly suggest that the introduction of Zn in the K0.8Fe2_{2-y}Se2 system induces large effective magnetic moments, probably implying that the nonmagnetic Zn doping is indeed "magnetic". The magnetic nature of Zn doping can be understood in this way: locally the neighboring Fe ions can form an antiferromagnetic interaction in the K0.8Fe2_{2-y}Se2 parent superconductor. With the substitution of Fe by Zn, the nearby AFM interaction is broken and the Fe2^{+} ions around the Zn impurities give rise to local magnetic moments. For the Cr- and Co-doped samples, the superconducting transition temperature decreases nearly linearly with increasing doping content x, which is consistent with the Abrikosov-Gork'ov's pair-breaking theory. These facts suggest that the magnetic pair-breaking effect may play an important role in depression of the superconductivity. Since the nonmagnetic Zn ions destroy the superconductivity in the K_{x}Fe2_{2-y}Se2 system the fastest, it seems that the suppression of superconductivity in this system does not obey the rule in a way traditional s-wave superconductor behaves. However, more efforts are still needed to clarify this issue.

## IV Conclusion

In summary, we have studied the substitution effects in the K0.8Fe2-ySe2 superconductor. The substitution of Fe by Cr, Co, and Zn leads to strong depression of superconductivity. On the other hand, the doping of Mn hardly decreases the superconducting transition temperature. We find that the introduction of Cr, Co, and Zn induces a large effective magnetic moment in the system, while the Mn ions introduce less effective moment. In the Cr-, Co-, and Zn-doped samples, the depression of superconductivity is due to the pair-breaking effect. On the other hand, in the Mn-doped case, the impurity scattering is small-angle scattering or small-momentum transfer. Thus Mn-doping hardly suppresses T_{c}.

###### Abstract

In this paper, we perform Fe-site substitution experiments on K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} superconductor by choosing Cr, Mn, Co, and Zn as dopants. It is found that the doping of Cr, Co, and Zn leads to a drastic depression of superconductivity, while the introduction of Mn does not decrease the superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) when x\leqslant 0.067. Electron-spin-resonance measurements reveal the existence of strong magnetic fluctuation in both the parent compound and the doped samples. In the Cr-, Co-, and Zn-doped samples, the magnetic pair-breaking effect severely affects the superconductivity, resulting in drastic depression of superconductivity. On the other hand, in the Mn-doped case, it does not break the cooper pairs and thus hardly affects the T_{c} value.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in FeAs-based systems has sparked great interests in the condensed matter physics community [1, 2, 3] because the comparison between the FeAs-based superconductors and the cuprate superconductors may help to solve the question of the high-temperature superconducting mechanism. However, large difference has been found between these two classes of high-temperature superconductors. For example, the parent compound of the FeAs-based systems is bad metal, whereas it is Mott insulator for the cuprate systems. The FeAs-based superconductors generally exhibit a complicated spin-density-wave transition, while there is no such transition in the Cu-based compounds. More importantly, it has been experimentally and theoretically proven that the predominant pairing symmetry of the cuprate superconductors is d-wave pairing, while there is strong evidence that the possible pairing symmetry is s^{\pm} wave in the iron-arsenic superconductors. [45]

Recently, superconductivity with T_{c} up to 32 K has been reported in A_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} (A = K, Rb, Cs, and Tl, AFSe-122 type). [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 5  K_{a} radiation at room temperature. The actual composition of the crystal was determined using energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometry (EDX). The resistivity was measured using a standard four-probe method. Magnetic properties were investigated using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. The electron-spin-resonance (ESR) measurements were performed at 9.40 GHz using a BRUKER EMXplus 10112 spectrometer equipped with a continuous He gas-flow cryostat in the temperature region of 2-300 K by sweeping magnetic field parallel to the _ab_ plane.

## III Results and Discussion

First of all, we would like to know whether or not the selected dopants are really incorporated into the K0.8Fe2-,Se2 lattice. In order to determine the real compositions of the crystals, we performed energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometry analysis on the Cr-, Mn-, Co-, and Zn-doped K0.8Fe2-,Se2 samples. The comparison between nominal and real compositions of several representative K0.8Fe2-, M_{x}Se2 (M= Cr, Mn, Co, and Zn) samples is listed in Table 1. It is found that the Mn atoms can be incorporated into the system easily at low-doping level. That is, the real Mn content is almost the same as the nominal concentration when x\leqslant 5%. However, When x>5%, it is difficult to incorporate more Mn into the lattice. For example, the real Mn content is 0.067 in the sample with nominal Mn concentration of 0.10. For the other dopants, we find that the Cr, Co, and Zn atoms have much smaller solubility comparing to Mn. For example, for the sample with nominal Cr doping concentration 5%, it shows that the real Cr content in the single crystal is only about 0.015. And the actual Cr content is about 0.024 in the sample with nominal Cr concentration of 0.10. For the Co-and Zn-doped samples, similar behavior was also found. These results are completely different from the case of doped BaFe2-,As2. In the latter case, the transition metals, such as Co, Cr, Mn, Zn, etc., can be easily introduced into the BaFe2-As2 lattice with high doping content.12-14

Large-size plate-like single crystals with dimensions up to 6\times 5\times 2 mm3 can be grown. A picture of the as-grown K0.8Fe2-,Se2 single crystal is shown in Fig. 1(a). In order to check the quality of the single-crystal samples, we perform single-crystal XRD measurements and the representative single-crystal XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 1(a) (the red curve). Only the (00_l_) diffraction peaks with even l are observed, confirming that the crystallographic c axis is perpendicular to the shining surface. For all the diffraction peaks, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is less than 0.06^{\circ}, indicating the high quality of the samples. It should be noted that there is another series of (00_l_) peaks (marked by the asterisks), which are located in a lower angle of the main peaks of the K0.8Fe2-,Se2 parent sample, implying that there might be a modulation structure along c axis. The existence of modulation structure in the K0.8Fe2-,Se2 sample has been confirmed by neutron diffraction and single-crystal XRD measurements, transmission electron microscopy measurement, and other experiments.15-17 Figure 1(a) gives the powder XRD pattern of the Co-doped K0.8Fe2-,Se2 samples. All the diffraction peaks can be indexed using the space group of 14/mmm with no unidentified peaks. The lattice parameters for the parent compound are a=3.9106 A and c=14.0663 A, which are similar to previous reported values.6 Figures 1(b) and 1(c) give the a axis and c axis lattice constants as the function of transition-metal doping content (_x_), respectively. From Fig. 1(b), we find that the a axis lattice parameter slightly increases with increasing Cr, Mn, and Co doping content, while it decreases in the Zn-doped samples. For the c axis constant, it decreases monotonously with increasing transition-metal doping content.

Figures 2(a)-2(d) give the temperature dependence of inelastic resistivity of K0.8Fe2-,-Zr,Se2, K0.8Fe2-,-Mn,Se2, K0.8Fe2-,-x-Co,Se2, and K0.8Fe2-,-Zn,Se2, respectively. At high temperature, the resistivity of the parent compound, K0.8Fe2-,Se2, increases with decreasing temperature and exhibits a broad hump at about 115 K. With further cooling, metallic transport behavior appears and the superconductivity occurs at T_{c}^{\rm onset}\sim 30.5 K. The superconducting transition width, \Delta T_{c}, is less than 2 K, indicating very high quality of the single crystal. A striking difference among the Cr-, Mn-, Co-, and Zn-doping samples is that the doping of Co and Mn leads to the shift of the resistance hump in the \rho\simT curve toward higher temperature, while the doping of Cr and Zn leads to the shift toward low temperature. We also notice that the doping exhibits different response of superconductivity on the transition-metal impurities for the Cr-, Co-, Zn-, and Mn-doped samples. The plot of the _T_c versus doping content x for each doping element is shown in Fig. 3(a). One can see that the _T_c value decreases nearly linearly with increasing x for K0.8Fe2-,-x-Zr,Se2 and K0.8Fe2-,-Ca0.8Fe2. For the K0.8Fe2-,-x-Zn,Se2 series, the superconductivity is completely depressed with only 0.5% doping of Zn, indicating that Zn impurity suppresses the superconductivity more violently. For the K0.8Fe2-,-x-Mn,Se2 series, the situation is completely different. The doping of Mn does not decrease the _T_c of the samples at all.

Figure 4 gives the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility of the K0.8Fe2-,-y-,M_x_ Se2 (M= Cr, Mn, Co, and Zn) near the superconducting transition temperature. Strong diamagnetic signal is detected below T_{c}\sim 30.5 K in the K0.8Fe2-,Se2 sample, which is consistent with the resistivity results. In the inset of Fig. 4(a), the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility of the K0.8Fe2-,-Se2 under both zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) conditions is given. One can see that the magnetic transition to the Meissner state is

  very broad, suggesting that the sample is not in uniform superconducting state. The rather wide \Delta T_{c} detected from magnetic susceptibility indicates the existence of vortex pinning that could be due to the K and Fe deficiency. From Figs. 4(a) and 4(c), we notice that both the superconducting transition temperature and the superconducting volume fraction decrease severely with increasing doping content in the Cr-and Co-doped samples. The superconductivity disappears completely when the real doping concentration is higher than x=0.01 for Cr and x=0.018 for Co doping. For the Zn-doped samples, the superconducting volume fraction is nearly zero in the x=0.005 sample, suggesting that the Zn dopants depress the superconductivity more violently. The magnetic-susceptibility results are nicely consistent with the resistivity data. For the Mn-doped samples, though the superconducting volume fraction decreases monotonously with increasing Mn doping, the superconducting transition temperature keeps unchanged. The decrease of superconducting volume fraction is understandable if we consider that there are certain nonsuperconducting islands around the Mn dopants.

Figure 5 plots the temperature dependence of magnetization of the Cr-, Mn-, Co-, and Zn-doped samples at high temperature. The normal-state magnetic susceptibility for the parent compound, K0.8Fe2_{2-y}Se2, decreases slightly with decreasing temperature below \sim300 K, which is consistent with the AFM state (the T_{N} is about 559 K in K0.8Fe2_{2-y}Se2 sample [15]). For all the K0.8Fe2_{2-y-x}M_{x}Se2, the introduction of transition-metal dopants leads to an increase of magnetization, both in the magnetic-ion-doped samples and in the nonmagnetic-ion-doped samples. In a simple Curie's law picture, the magnetic susceptibility in a sample at a certain temperature is proportional to the effective magnetic moment of the magnetic ions. Thus the gradual increase of magnetic susceptibility in the transition-metal-doped samples suggests that both the magnetic and the nonmagnetic ions induce effective magnetic moments in the system. For the Cr-doped samples, the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility exhibits a strange hump near 100 K. In the inset of Fig. 5(a), we show the comparison of the magnetization measured under ZFC condition and FC conditions for the x=0.024 sample. It shows that the FC curve does not coincide with ZFC curve below \sim140 K, which is a characteristic of cluster glass that has no simple long-range magnetic order. [18] The origin of the cluster-glass behavior is not clear. A possible origin is some small-size ferromagnetic impurities induced by Cr dopants. For the Mn-doped case, the increase of magnetization is rather small, implying that Mn ions rarely affect the magnetic property of the K0.8Fe2_{2-y}Se2 system. In other words, the doping of Mn introduces a small effective magnetic moment in the system. For the Co-and Zn-doped cases, the increase of magnetic susceptibility is significantly larger than that in the Mn-doped samples.

  It should be noted that the nonmagnetic Zn ions do not carry moments and thus do not introduce magnetic moments in conventional superconductors. Thus the substantial increase of magnetic susceptibility by Zn-doping is interesting. The introduction of magnetic moments in Zn-doped K_{0.8}Fe_{2-\gamma-}Se_{2} is similar to a previous study in a cuprate superconductor, where the doping of Zn in high-T_{c} cuprate La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4} induces 1.2 \mu_{B}/Zn moment.[19] The formation of magnetic moment due to the impurities is directly related to the response of Fe-Se tetrahedron to a local perturbation. For the nonmagnetic Zn dopant, the result of doping is to locally remove the spin of Fe^{2+} and break the AFM magnetic fluctuation. In this way, the magnetic moments of neighboring Fe ions may change accordingly. Since both the magnetic (such as Cr and Co) and nonmagnetic ions (Zn) introduce large effective magnetic moment into the system, it is possible that the magnetic pair-breaking effect destroys the superconductivity. For the Mn-doped sample, much less effective moment is introduced, thus it hardly affect the superconducting transition temperature.

In a conventional s-wave superconductor, magnetic impurities are extremely harmful to the cooper-pairs due to the strong scattering of the impurity spins on the conduction electrons, while nonmagnetic impurities will not lead to apparent pair-breaking effects. On the other hand, for high-temperature superconductors with d-wave symmetry of the order parameter modulated in k space, the assumption of uniform order parameter has already been broken for a clean system. As a consequence, the nonmagnetic impurities mixing wave vectors k of the paring potential \Delta_{k} act on the superconductivity in a similar way as the magnetic ones, leading to a pair-breaking effect.[19, 20, 21] According to the Abrikosov-Gork'ov theory,[22] if the impurities act as strong pair breakers, the depression of T_{c} due to the pair-breaking effect is related to the impurity scattering rate K_{B}\Delta T_{c}\approx\pi\hbar/8\tau_{\rm imp}\propto\rho_{0}, where \tau_{\rm imp} is the quasiparticle lifetime of the impurity and \rho_{0} is the residual resistivity. Therefore, we plot the doping dependence of residual resistivity \rho_{0} for each transition-metal impurity in Fig. 3(b). It is apparent that Zn doping results in a very rapid increase of \rho_{0}. This reasonably leads to the most violent  depression of superconductivity. On the other hand, Mn doping only leads to very weak change in \rho_{0}, implying that the impurity scattering induced by Mn-doping is, in principle, small-angle scattering or small-momentum transfer. Thus Mn doping hardly suppresses T_{c}. For the Cr- and Co-doping samples, the increase of \rho_{0} is moderate but apparent, then the depression of superconductivity is stronger than that in Mn-doped samples, but weaker than the Zn-doped case.

In order to investigate the influence of the transition-metal dopants on the magnetic state of the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} system in detail, we perform ESR measurements on the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} parent superconductor and the doped K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y\to x}M_{x}Se_{2} (M = Cr, Mn, Co, Zn) samples. ESR has been shown to be a highly sensitive tool to study the magnetic fluctuations and magnetic interactions in cuprate superconductors and their parent compounds.[23] For the iron-based superconductors where the role of magnetic fluctuation on the superconductivity is highly debatable, ESR may give us some information on this issue. In the ESR measurement, microwave radiation with fixed frequency (\upsilon=9.4 GHz in our instrument) enters the sample cavity and the external magnetic field is swept from 0 to 8000 Oe. In the simplest case, ESR will occur when

\[h\upsilon=g\mu_{B}H,\] (1)

where h is the Planck constant, g is the electron so-called Lande g factor, \mu_{B} is the Bohr magneton, and H is the applied magnetic field. The g factor for the unpaired electrons is g_{e} = 2.0023. According to Eq. (1), the resonance field H_{\rm res} should be located at H_{\rm res}\sim 3330 Oe for unpaired electrons if there is no internal interaction. The ESR spectra of K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} superconductor from 2 to 300 K is shown in Fig. 6(a). Below T_{c}, the ESR spectra exhibits a diplike signal at low-field region, which is due to the magnetic shielding below the lower critical field H_{\rm c1}\approx 70 Oe. At high temperature, the ESR spectra shows a single exchange-narrowed resonance line, which is well described by a Dyson shape, i.e., a Lorentz line at resonance field H_{\rm res}.[24] The H_{\rm res} value is 3313 Oe at 300 K, which is very close to 3330 Oe. With decreasing temperature, the resonance field exhibits a slight shift to a lower field. The temperature dependence of H_{\rm res} is shown in Fig. 6(b). The low-field shift of H_{\rm res} may originate from the formation of ferromagnetic interactions or the change in crystal field. Since the crystallographic study of the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} crystal does not show any change in crystal structure, the change in crystal field should be very little. Thus the low-field shift of H_{\rm res} suggests the formation of a certain kind of ferromagnetic interactions in the sample, similar to that in colossal magnetoresistance materials.[25] If there are some ferromagnetic interactions, the effective magnetic field H_{\rm eff} around the unpaired electrons can be written as

\[H_{\rm eff}=H_{\rm ext}+H_{\rm exchange}+H_{\rm dipole}+H_{\rm demag }+H_{\rm anisotropic}+\ldots\] (2)

where H_{\rm ext} is the applied magnetic field, H_{\rm exchange} is the contribution from exchange interaction of electron spins, H_{\rm dipole} is the contribution of small-size magnetic clusters, H_{\rm demag} comes from the demagnetization factor, and H_{\rm anisotropic} is the effective magneto-crystalline anisotropy field. If some ferromagnetic interactions exist, the terms H_{\rm exchange}, H_{\rm dipole}, H_{\rm demag}, and H_{\rm anisotropic} plus the rest "\ldots" can provide a positive effective magnetic field around the electrons. In this case, the external magnetic field needed for the occurrence of resonance should be less than 3330 Oe.

From Fig. 6(a), we also notice that the intensity of the resonant absorption (defined as the height between the top and the bottom of the spectra) gradually decreases with decreasing temperature. In order to see the decrease clearly, we plot in Fig. 6(c) the temperature dependence of relative intensity [I(T)/I(300 K)]. The slight decrease of resonance intensity is consistent with the formation of antiferromagnetic magnetic fluctuation in the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} system.[10; 15] The ESR results are also consistent with the magnetic-susceptibility data shown in Fig. 5 where the normal-state magnetic susceptibility for the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} parent compound decreases slightly with decreasing temperature below 300 K. Another noticeable feature is that the ESR linewidth (\Delta H) broadens at low temperature. The temperature dependence of \Delta H is shown in Fig. 6(d). The ESR linewidth is determined by the spin-lattice relaxation time T_{1}.[24] Thus ESR measurements provide information complementary to nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) experiments. From Fig. 6(d), it can be seen that the ESR linewidth \Delta H increases with decreasing temperature below

Figure 3: (Color online) (a) The plot of the T_{c} value vs x for the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y\to x}M_{x}Se_{2} (M = Cr, Mn, Co, and Zn) samples. (b) The plot of the residual resistivity vs x.

  300 K, indicating a shortening of the spin-lattice relaxation time T_{1}. Below \sim100 K, \Delta_H_ increases rapidly with decreasing temperature, suggesting that the spin-lattice-relaxation time shortens very fast at low temperature, which is consistent with the strong enhancement of magnetic fluctuation. In Ba_{0.72}K_{0.28}Fe_{2}As_{2} superconductor, strong enhancement of magnetic fluctuation below \sim70 K has been discovered by NMR measurements.[26] In K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} superconductor, there is no report on magnetic fluctuation so far. The ESR results give the evidence of strong magnetic fluctuation in this system. There are many experimental and theoretical studies on the magnetic-fluctuation effects in the iron-based superconductors that suggest that the magnetic fluctuation is important for the superconductivity in Fe-based systems.[27, 28, 29, 30] Here, we find that the magnetic fluctuation exists in the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} superconductor. The significant enhancement of magnetic fluctuation below \sim100 K seems to be consistent with the argument that the magnetic fluctuation is important for the superconductivity.

Figure 7 gives the ESR spectra for the Cr-, Mn-, Co-, and Zn-doped samples. It is found that the introduction of transition-metal dopants leads to significant change in the shape of the ESR spectra. In order to investigate the change quantitatively, we plot in Figs. 6(b)-6(d) the comparison of the position of resonance magnetic field, the relative intensity, and the ESR linewidth between the transition-metal-doped and the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} parent samples. From Figs. 6(b)-6(d), one can see that Mn doping induces very little change in the temperature dependence of resonance magnetic field, the relative intensity, and the ESR linewidth compared with the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} parent sample. The relatively small perturbation in the ESR is consistent with the magnetic-susceptibility results where the introduction of Mn only leads to slight increase of magnetic susceptibility. From Fig. 6(b) we notice

Figure 4: (Color online) The temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility of the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y-x}M_{\rm{,}}Se_{2} (M= Cr, Mn, Co, and Zn) samples near the superconducting transition temperature. (The data are collected under zero-field-cooling condition with external magnetic field of 100 gauss.) In the inset, the comparison of magnetic susceptibility between ZFC condition and FC condition for the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} parent sample is given.

  that the position of the resonance magnetic field in the Cr- and Zn-doped samples is smaller than 3330 Oe at 300 K, indicating that some ferromagnetic interaction might be formed even at high temperature. This is also consistent with the magnetic-susceptibility results where the M\sim T curve does not obey the Curie-Weiss law at high temperature. For the Co-doped sample, it shows that the position of the resonance magnetic field hardly decreases below 100 K, suggesting that the the ferromagnetic interaction is very weak. The temperature dependence of relative intensity shown in Fig. 6(c) suggests that the resonant absorption is much weakened at low temperature in all samples, meaning that the AFM magnetic fluctuation is very strong despite of the introduction of transition-metal impurities. The strong enhancement of magnetic fluctuation is also confirmed by the rapid increase of ESR linewidth \Delta H below \sim100 K [shown in Fig. 6(d)].

In the iron-arsenic superconductors, experiments have revealed that the AFM magnetic fluctuation and the multiband effects are two key factors for driving the system into the superconducting state.[27, 28, 29, 30, 31] These experimental results give partial support to the picture that the pairing may be established via interband scattering of electrons between the hole pockets near \Gamma point and electron pockets around M point, leading to the so-called s^{\pm} pairing mechanism. However, in the A_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} (A = K, Rb, Cs, and Tl) superconductors, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments have revealed the disappearance of the hole-like Fermi-surface sheet around \Gamma point.[11] The ARPES results suggest that interband scattering or Fermi-surface nesting is not a necessary ingredient for the unconventional superconductivity in iron-based superconductors. From the ARPES results, it is suggested that a more conventional s-wave pairing is probably a better description. In this work, we present the investigation on the transport and magnetic properties of the K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} system with transition-metal doping at Fe site. The most important result is that the doping of nonmagnetic Zn ions leads to the strongest depression of the superconductivity. This is completely different from that in conventional superconductors where nonmagnetic impurities do not break the cooper pairs. The strong suppression of superconductivity by Zn doping is similar to that in doped cuprates where a strong pair-breaking effect occurs with nonmagnetic-impurity

  doping. The magnetization and ESR results clearly suggest that the introduction of Zn in the K0.8Fe2_{2-y}Se2 system induces large effective magnetic moments, probably implying that the nonmagnetic Zn doping is indeed "magnetic". The magnetic nature of Zn doping can be understood in this way: locally the neighboring Fe ions can form an antiferromagnetic interaction in the K0.8Fe2_{2-y}Se2 parent superconductor. With the substitution of Fe by Zn, the nearby AFM interaction is broken and the Fe2^{+} ions around the Zn impurities give rise to local magnetic moments. For the Cr- and Co-doped samples, the superconducting transition temperature decreases nearly linearly with increasing doping content x, which is consistent with the Abrikosov-Gork'ov's pair-breaking theory. These facts suggest that the magnetic pair-breaking effect may play an important role in depression of the superconductivity. Since the nonmagnetic Zn ions destroy the superconductivity in the K_{x}Fe2_{2-y}Se2 system the fastest, it seems that the suppression of superconductivity in this system does not obey the rule in a way traditional s-wave superconductor behaves. However, more efforts are still needed to clarify this issue.

## IV Conclusion

In summary, we have studied the substitution effects in the K0.8Fe2-ySe2 superconductor. The substitution of Fe by Cr, Co, and Zn leads to strong depression of superconductivity. On the other hand, the doping of Mn hardly decreases the superconducting transition temperature. We find that the introduction of Cr, Co, and Zn induces a large effective magnetic moment in the system, while the Mn ions introduce less effective moment. In the Cr-, Co-, and Zn-doped samples, the depression of superconductivity is due to the pair-breaking effect. On the other hand, in the Mn-doped case, the impurity scattering is small-angle scattering or small-momentum transfer. Thus Mn-doping hardly suppresses T_{c}.
