###### Abstract

We investigated the effects of phosphorus substitution on the shape of the T_{c}(x) dome in 1111-type SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} (0 <x< 0.5). Hydride ion substitution of oxide sites (O^{2-}\rightarrow H^{-}) exerts a chemical pressure effect, i.e., a structural reduction of the Pn-Fe-Pn angle \alpha (Pn = P, As) and also dopes electrons into the FePn layer to induce superconductivity. Isovalent phosphorus substitution (P^{3-}\rightarrow As^{3-}) can induce only a chemical pressure effect, i.e., an increase of \alpha for La substitution of Sm sites. As \gamma increases from 0.0 to 0.5, the single T_{c} dome gradually splits into two domes, similar to those of LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} with a T_{c} valley at x\approx 0.16. We found that the T_{c} valley is located around (x, \alpha) \approx (0.16, 113^{\circ}) for both of the SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} and LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} series, irrespective of changes in the Pn anion and Ln cation species. This result suggests that suppression of T_{c} leads to the emergence of a T_{c} valley when both the shape of Fe Pn_{4} tetrahedra represented by \alpha and electron-doping level of x meet the above criterion in 1111-type iron oxypnictide superconductors.

## I Introduction

1111-type LnFeAsO (Ln = lanthanide) composed of an FeAs conducting layer and a LnO insulating layer is a prototypical parent compound of iron-based superconductors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] showing a tetragonal-orthorhombic structural transition at 120-160 K accompanied by antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of Fe spins [9, 10, 11]. Superconductivity, with a critical temperature T_{c} of up to 57.8 K [12, 13], emerges when the structural-magnetic transition is suppressed by electron doping of the FeAs layer via fluoride-ion (F^{-}) substitution of oxygen sites. The doped electron concentration x vs temperature T diagram of LnFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} possess a superconducting (SC) region in the range x = 0.1-0.2 adjacent to an AFM region at x\approx 0.0 [14], although the whole shape of the SC region has not been determined because the solubility limit of F^{-} restricts x to <0.2. The SC region adjacent to the AFM region is a common feature of the electronic phase diagram for many unconventional superconductors, including iron pnictides [15]. Therefore, the electronic structure of LnFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} has been well studied, and the material dependence of T_{c} on the spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing mechanism has been explained to some degree [16, 17, 18, 19].

Recently, we found that the SC region continues beyond x\approx 0.4 far from the AFM region by inducing high electron doping, with x up to 0.5, using hydride-ion (H^{-}) substitution in place of F^{-}[20, 21, 22, 23]. In particular, LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} features a SC region with a unique shape that consists of a conventional dome (SC1) around x\approx 0.1 with a maximum T_{c} (T_{c}^{\max}) of 29 K and an additional dome (SC2) around x\approx 0.3 with a T_{c}^{\max} of 36 K. Inelastic neutron-scattering measurements of LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} revealed a switch of momentum transfer of magnetic excitation from 1.14 A^{-1} for the first dome to 1.25-1.38 A^{-1} for the second dome, indicating that the pairing channels for SC1 and SC2 regions are different from each other [24]. The split of the SC region, i.e., the emergence of double dome T_{c} structures, is an unexpected phenomenon in iron-based superconductors from theoretical studies. Thus, we consider that the elucidation of its origin is key to understanding the SC mechanism and to exploring the pathway to improve T_{c}.

Here we focus on the effects of physical and chemical pressure on the T_{c}-dome shape reported in Ref. [22]. When a physical pressure of up to 3 GPa was applied, the two SC regions for LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} merged into a single dome with T_{c}^{\max} = 47 K. A similar phenomenon was also induced by replacement of La with Ce, Sm, and Gd. These results strongly suggest that the T_{c}-dome shape is controlled by the local structure of the FeAs_{4} tetrahedron. As for the Pn-Fe-Pn angle \alpha of the FePn_{4} tetrahedron (Pn = P, As), Lee _et al_. have suggested that T_{c} increases as \alpha approaches that of a regular tetrahedron [25]. Further, Kuroki _et al_. proposed on the basis of theoretical calculations that T_{c} is raised as the Pn height between the F-d plane h_{Pn}[18, 19] is increased. However, because both structural parameters are related to each other by the equation h_{Pn}=r_{\rm Fe-}r_{\rm Fe}cos(\frac{\alpha}{2}), where r_{\rm Fe-}r_{\rm Fe} is the Fe-Pn bond length, it is difficult to distinguish which parameters of \alpha and h_{Pn} have a dominant effect on the T_{c}-dome shape.

In this paper, we report the effects of phosphorus substitution on the T_{c}(x)-dome shape of 1111-type SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} (0 \leqx< 0.5). Isovalent P substitution of the As site (P^{3-}\rightarrow As^{3-}) induces a chemical pressure effect that changes \alpha and h_{Pn} in a similar manner to that induced by La-substitution of the Sm site. As a result, we found double dome-shaped SC regions in y = 0.45 and 0.53. Because P substitution changes r_{\rm Fe-}r_{\rm Fe}, the resulting crystal structure can access the region in (\alpha, h_{Pn}) space unexplored by Ln substitution. By considering the behavior of \alpha and h_{Pn} in SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} and LnFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} (Ln = La, Ce, Sm) systems, we discuss the controlling factors for the T_{c}(x)-dome shape of 1111-type Fe pnictides.

## II Experimental

SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} with nominal y (y_{\rm nom}) = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.6 were synthesized by the solid-state reaction of SmAs, FeAs, Fe_{2}As, Fe_{2}P, Sm_{2}O_{3}, and SmH_{2} using a belt-type high pressure anvil cell. The metal arsenides and phosphides were prepared from their respective metals. SmH_{2} was synthesized by heating metal samarium in a H_{2} atmosphere. All starting materials and precursors for the synthesis were prepared in a glove box filled with purified Ar gas (H_{2}O, O_{2}< 1 ppm). The mixture of stating materials was placed into a BN capsule with a mixture of Ca(OH)_{2} and NaBH_{4} as an excess hydrogen source and then heated at 1473 K and 2 GPa for 30 min.

The amount of hydrogen incorporated into the resulting samples was evaluated by thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS; ESCO TDS1200). Approximately 5 mg of the sample was heated to 1373 K at a heating rate of 60 K/min under vacuum <10^{-6} Pa. Hydrogen released from the sample, in the form of H_{2} molecules, was ionized and detected by a quadrupole mass spectrometer as an ion with mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) = 2. Other nonhydrogen elemental compositions (Sm: Fe: As: P: O) were determined by a electron-probe microanalyzer (EPMA; JEOL model JXA-8530F) equipped with a field-emission-type electron gun and wavelength dispersive x-ray detector. The micrometer-scale compositions within the main phase were probed on five to 10 focal points, and the results were averaged.

Phase purity of the resulting samples was determined by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker diffractometer model D8 ADVANCE (Cu rotating anode). The crystallographic parameters of the synthesized 1111-type compounds were determined by Rietveld analysis of XRD patterns using TOPAS code [26], assuming a tetragonal symmetry (space group of P4/mmnz, lattice parameters a = b\approx 0.39 nm and c\approx 0.84 nm) with atomic positions of Sm (1/4, 1/4, 25m), Fe (3/4, 1/4, 1/2), Pn (1/4, 1/4, z_{Pn}), and O (3/4, 1/4, 0). During the refinement of structural parameters, site occupancies of Pn and O sites were fixed to the values estimated by the EPMA.

Four-probe dc resistivity (\rho) and magnetic susceptibility (\chi) were measured in the temperature range 2-300 K, using a physical properties measurement system (Quantum Design, Inc.) with a vibrating sample magnetometer attachment.

## III Results and Discussion

### P-substitution effect on \alpha and h_{Pn}

Using high pressure techniques, we obtained polycrystalline pellets containing >80 weight% of the 1111-type phase of SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} (0 \leqx< 0.5). The elemental composition analysis indicates that actual phosphorous content y tended to be less than the nominal content y_{\rm nom} of the starting mixtures. As a result, we obtained samples with y values of \approx0.23, \approx0.45, and \approx0.53 from starting mixtures with y_{\rm nom} = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.6, respectively. The composition analysis is described in detail in the Supplemental Material [27]. The amount of oxide vacancies measured almost matched the hydrogen content, indicating that the oxide ions are successfully replaced by hydride to form SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x}. Previous neutron diffraction analysis and density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the hydrogen exclusively replaces O^{2-} sites in the form of H^{-} ions and supplies an electron to the Fe_Pn_ layer to maintain charge neutrality [21].

Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show the variations in the lattice parameters (a and c) and z coordinate of Sm and Pn sites (z_{\rm Sm} and z_{Pn}) as a function of x in SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} specified by y = 0, \approx0.23, \approx0.45, and \approx0.53. With increases in x, the lattice parameters decrease, and the z coordinates increase, i.e., Sm_{\rm O} and Fe_Pn__{4} tetrahedra become stretched along the c axis upon compression of the crystal lattice. With increases in y, a(x) and c(x) curves are shifted down, and the z_{\rm Sm}(x) curve is shifted up, indicating that the effects of P substitution on these parameters are the same as those of H substitution. In contrast, the effect of P substitution on z_{Pn} is the opposite to that of H substitution. Because P-substitution effects are the same as those of La and Ce substitution of Sm sites, the ranges of the geometric parameters of Fe_Pn__{4} tetrahedron, i.e., \alpha and h_{Pn} in SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x}, partially overlap with those of the LnFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} (Ln = La-Sm) system.

Figure 2 shows \alpha vs h_{Pn} plots for LnFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} and SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x}. All the points of LnFeAsO_{1-x}H are located within a narrow bandlike region corresponding to r_{\rm Fe\text{-}}_Pn_ = 0.239-0.243 nm. In contrast to Ln or H substitution, which increases r_{\rm Fe\text{-}}_Pn_ (+2 pm for 50% H substitution and full substitution of La to Sm), P substitution decreases r_{\rm Fe\text{-}}_Pn_ (-7 pm for 50% P substitution) and expands the observable range in (\alpha, h_{Pn}) space to allow investigation of the structural dependence of the T_{c}-dome shape.

### P-substitution effect on T_{c}-dome shape

Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of resistivity for y\approx 0.23. At x=0, a kink in resistivity due to structural-magnetic transitions was observed around 00 K. As x increases, a sudden drop in resistivity to zero was observed at x>0.11. The maximum onset T_{c} was 44.5 K at x=0.20, and this decreased to <2 K at x=0.38. For y\approx 0.45, as shown in Fig. 3(b), superconductivity was also observed at x>0.08. The T_{c} decreased from 22.5 K at x=0.08 to 18 K at x=0.16 but subsequently increased to 24 K at x=0.21. Finally, T_{c} decreased to <2 K at x=0.43. A similar drop in T_{c} at x=0.16 was also observed for y\approx 0.53 [see Fig. 3(c)]. T_{c}=4 K was observed at x=0.15 between x=0.12 and 0.18, showing T_{c}^{\max}=14 K [27]. It is notable that a drop of resistivity was observed at \approx5 K in the x = 0.0 sample with y\approx 0.53. Because a drop in magnetic susceptibility was not observed in this temperature region, it is likely to originate from an AFM transition of Sm^{3+} spins similar to that observed in SmFePO [28]. Behavior observed in \chi-T profiles also reflected the development of bulk superconductivity, as shown in Figs. 3(d)-3(f). A drop in susceptibility due to SC transitions was observed at the magnetic onset T_{c}mag, which was slightly lower than the resistivity onset T_{c}. As shown in Figs. 3(e) and 3(f), a drop of T_{c}mag was observed at x=0.15-0.16 for y\approx 0.45 and 0.53. Figure 4 summarizes the magnetic onset T_{c}mag as a function of x. A T_{c}mag (x) curve for y=0 taken from a previous paper [22] is also shown in this

Inset is a drawing of edge-shared Fe Pn_{4} tetrahedra in L\muFePnO with notation of \alpha (Pn-Fe-Pn), \beta (another Pn-Fe-Pn), and \gamma (Fe-Pn-Fe) angles and pnictogen height h_{Pn}. Lines are guides to the eye, tracing the \alpha-h_{Pa} relation for specified y and Ln. In L\muFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x}, the change in Fe-As bond length is small (r_{\rm Fe-Pn} = 0.239â€“0.243 mm), and h_{Pb} is strongly linked to \alpha. By replacing As by P, r_{\rm Fe-Pn} clearly decreases.

 figure. In contrast to the single dome-shaped SC region for y = 0 and \approx0.23, a small valley is found at the center of the SC region in the y\approx 0.45 system. The split of the SC region was enhanced by further increase in y and the non-SC region (T_{c}< 2 K) was found at x\approx 0.16 in the y\approx 0.53 series.

### T_{c} valley on x-\alpha and x-h_{Pa} spaces

Figure 5(a) is an \alpha vs x plot for SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} and LnFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x}. The symbol size of each point represents the T_{c} value. Because of the chemical pressure effect of H substitution, the \alpha(x) curve of SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} has a negative slope, and its intercept \alpha_{0} at x=0 increases with P or La/Ce substitution of Sm sites. Therefore, the ranges of \alpha(x) curves for y= 0.23-0.53 overlap with those for Ln = La, Ce. The regions of the T_{c} valleys for y= 0.45 and 0.53 are denoted by a light blue area and those for Ln = La by a light pink area. Both regions are clearly located at the same area around (x, \alpha) = (\approx0.16, \approx113^{\circ}). In other words, double dome-shaped T_{c}(x) curves are observed when the \alpha(x) curve has a relatively large \alpha_{0} (>114^{\circ}) and passes through the region around (\approx0.16, \approx113^{\circ}). Figure 5(b) is an analogous x vs h_{Pa} plot. In x-h_{Pa} space, the T_{c} valley for y= 0.45-0.53 is located at a position with different h_{Pa} (0.130 nm for y= 0.45-0.53; 0.134 nm for Ln = La). In addition, a drop of T_{c} is not observed in the y\approx 0.23 series, while their h_{Pa}(x) curve crosses the region of the T_{c} valley of LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x}. These results indicate that the emergence of a T_{c} valley depends on \alpha and not h_{Pa}, irrespective of the Pn anion and Ln cation species.

Finally, we discuss the effects of \alpha on T_{c}. Parallel to this study, we have discovered the AFM ordering of iron spins with Neel temperature T_{N} up to 89 K in electron over-doped LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} (x= 0.45 and 0.51) [29]. The magnetic phase has a unique noncentrosymmetric structure different from that of the conventional AFM phase located at x\sim 0.0. This result suggests that the first and the second T_{c} domes in LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} come from different parent phases. Based on this idea, the result of the present study indicates that the T_{c} valley is a position where two SC phases encounter with each other, and their relationship becomes noncompetitive with the decrease of \alpha. Because of the relationship between \alpha and T_{c} in LnFePnO_{1-x}H_{x}, the "pairing glue" that induces superconductivity appears to depend on \alpha. A candidate for this glue is the electron-phonon interaction associated with \alpha. Saito _et al._ suggested in their orbital fluctuation theory that electron-phonon interactions are strongest when the FeAs_{1} tetrahedron has a regular shape (\alpha=109.5^{\circ}) [30]. This theory can empirically explain the maximum T_{c} occurring when \alpha is 109.5^{\circ}. However, in comparing the \alpha and x dependence of T_{c}, the resulting T_{c}-\alpha relation is not monotonic but does depend on x. Another possibility is spin fluctuation enhanced by hopping between Fe 3d orbitals via As 4p orbitals. The hopping integral, i.e., the overlap integral of Fe 3d and As 4p orbitals, is directly determined by the Fe-As-Fe angle \gamma having a one-to-one relation with \alpha: sin(\gamma/2)= 1/\sqrt{2}\cdot\sin(\alpha/2). In Fig. 5(a), the right vertical axis represents the \gamma value corresponding to \alpha, and we can confirm that the T_{c} valley is located at \gamma\sim 72^{\circ}.

Very recently, a calculation using the fluctuation exchange approximation successfully reproduced the shape variation of T_{c}-x with \alpha in a LnFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} system from a double dome shape at large \alpha to a single dome shape at small \alpha[31]. The primary suggestion by this calculation is that the spin-fluctuation enhancement mechanism is different between low x and high x regions. The spin fluctuation in the former

The region of the T_{c} valley for SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} is denoted by a light blue area around (x, \alpha) = (0.16, 113), which overlaps with that of LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} (denoted by a light pink colored area). (b) h_{Pa} vs x plot. The regions of the T_{c} valleys in each system do not overlap.

  region is caused by nesting of a Fermi surface composed of Fe 3d_{xz,yz} and 3d_{xy} orbitals, while that of the latter originates from real space motion of electrons within the 3d_{xy} orbitals, i.e., next-nearest-neighbor diagonal hopping (t_{2}) dominates the nearest-neighbor hopping (t_{1}). In this scheme, \alpha plays an important role in determining the magnitude of spin fluctuations and T_{c} because both t_{2} and indirect t_{1} (t_{1}^{\rm indirect}) are controlled by hopping via As 4p orbitals. Given the experimental findings and the theoretical real-space picture of electronic spin, \alpha is the decisive factor for the shape variation of T_{c}-x in LnFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} systems.

## IV Summary

We found a double dome-shaped SC region in the x-T diagram of SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} with y=0.45 and 0.53. This finding agrees with previous results on LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x}. By investigating the correlation between T_{c} and structural parameters of the Fe Pn_{4} tetrahedron, we confirmed that the T_{c} valley separating the two SC domes is located at x\approx 0.16 and \alpha\approx 113^{\circ} in both SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} and LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} systems. These results indicate that the emergence of two SC domes is generally induced in 1111-type iron oxypnictides when the electron-doping level matches the shape of the Fe Pn_{4} tetrahedron.

###### Abstract

We investigated the effects of phosphorus substitution on the shape of the T_{c}(x) dome in 1111-type SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} (0 <x< 0.5). Hydride ion substitution of oxide sites (O^{2-}\rightarrow H^{-}) exerts a chemical pressure effect, i.e., a structural reduction of the Pn-Fe-Pn angle \alpha (Pn = P, As) and also dopes electrons into the FePn layer to induce superconductivity. Isovalent phosphorus substitution (P^{3-}\rightarrow As^{3-}) can induce only a chemical pressure effect, i.e., an increase of \alpha for La substitution of Sm sites. As \gamma increases from 0.0 to 0.5, the single T_{c} dome gradually splits into two domes, similar to those of LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} with a T_{c} valley at x\approx 0.16. We found that the T_{c} valley is located around (x, \alpha) \approx (0.16, 113^{\circ}) for both of the SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} and LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} series, irrespective of changes in the Pn anion and Ln cation species. This result suggests that suppression of T_{c} leads to the emergence of a T_{c} valley when both the shape of Fe Pn_{4} tetrahedra represented by \alpha and electron-doping level of x meet the above criterion in 1111-type iron oxypnictide superconductors.

## I Introduction

1111-type LnFeAsO (Ln = lanthanide) composed of an FeAs conducting layer and a LnO insulating layer is a prototypical parent compound of iron-based superconductors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] showing a tetragonal-orthorhombic structural transition at 120-160 K accompanied by antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of Fe spins [9, 10, 11]. Superconductivity, with a critical temperature T_{c} of up to 57.8 K [12, 13], emerges when the structural-magnetic transition is suppressed by electron doping of the FeAs layer via fluoride-ion (F^{-}) substitution of oxygen sites. The doped electron concentration x vs temperature T diagram of LnFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} possess a superconducting (SC) region in the range x = 0.1-0.2 adjacent to an AFM region at x\approx 0.0 [14], although the whole shape of the SC region has not been determined because the solubility limit of F^{-} restricts x to <0.2. The SC region adjacent to the AFM region is a common feature of the electronic phase diagram for many unconventional superconductors, including iron pnictides [15]. Therefore, the electronic structure of LnFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} has been well studied, and the material dependence of T_{c} on the spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing mechanism has been explained to some degree [16, 17, 18, 19].

Recently, we found that the SC region continues beyond x\approx 0.4 far from the AFM region by inducing high electron doping, with x up to 0.5, using hydride-ion (H^{-}) substitution in place of F^{-}[20, 21, 22, 23]. In particular, LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} features a SC region with a unique shape that consists of a conventional dome (SC1) around x\approx 0.1 with a maximum T_{c} (T_{c}^{\max}) of 29 K and an additional dome (SC2) around x\approx 0.3 with a T_{c}^{\max} of 36 K. Inelastic neutron-scattering measurements of LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} revealed a switch of momentum transfer of magnetic excitation from 1.14 A^{-1} for the first dome to 1.25-1.38 A^{-1} for the second dome, indicating that the pairing channels for SC1 and SC2 regions are different from each other [24]. The split of the SC region, i.e., the emergence of double dome T_{c} structures, is an unexpected phenomenon in iron-based superconductors from theoretical studies. Thus, we consider that the elucidation of its origin is key to understanding the SC mechanism and to exploring the pathway to improve T_{c}.

Here we focus on the effects of physical and chemical pressure on the T_{c}-dome shape reported in Ref. [22]. When a physical pressure of up to 3 GPa was applied, the two SC regions for LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} merged into a single dome with T_{c}^{\max} = 47 K. A similar phenomenon was also induced by replacement of La with Ce, Sm, and Gd. These results strongly suggest that the T_{c}-dome shape is controlled by the local structure of the FeAs_{4} tetrahedron. As for the Pn-Fe-Pn angle \alpha of the FePn_{4} tetrahedron (Pn = P, As), Lee _et al_. have suggested that T_{c} increases as \alpha approaches that of a regular tetrahedron [25]. Further, Kuroki _et al_. proposed on the basis of theoretical calculations that T_{c} is raised as the Pn height between the F-d plane h_{Pn}[18, 19] is increased. However, because both structural parameters are related to each other by the equation h_{Pn}=r_{\rm Fe-}r_{\rm Fe}cos(\frac{\alpha}{2}), where r_{\rm Fe-}r_{\rm Fe} is the Fe-Pn bond length, it is difficult to distinguish which parameters of \alpha and h_{Pn} have a dominant effect on the T_{c}-dome shape.

In this paper, we report the effects of phosphorus substitution on the T_{c}(x)-dome shape of 1111-type SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} (0 \leqx< 0.5). Isovalent P substitution of the As site (P^{3-}\rightarrow As^{3-}) induces a chemical pressure effect that changes \alpha and h_{Pn} in a similar manner to that induced by La-substitution of the Sm site. As a result, we found double dome-shaped SC regions in y = 0.45 and 0.53. Because P substitution changes r_{\rm Fe-}r_{\rm Fe}, the resulting crystal structure can access the region in (\alpha, h_{Pn}) space unexplored by Ln substitution. By considering the behavior of \alpha and h_{Pn} in SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} and LnFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} (Ln = La, Ce, Sm) systems, we discuss the controlling factors for the T_{c}(x)-dome shape of 1111-type Fe pnictides.

## II Experimental

SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} with nominal y (y_{\rm nom}) = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.6 were synthesized by the solid-state reaction of SmAs, FeAs, Fe_{2}As, Fe_{2}P, Sm_{2}O_{3}, and SmH_{2} using a belt-type high pressure anvil cell. The metal arsenides and phosphides were prepared from their respective metals. SmH_{2} was synthesized by heating metal samarium in a H_{2} atmosphere. All starting materials and precursors for the synthesis were prepared in a glove box filled with purified Ar gas (H_{2}O, O_{2}< 1 ppm). The mixture of stating materials was placed into a BN capsule with a mixture of Ca(OH)_{2} and NaBH_{4} as an excess hydrogen source and then heated at 1473 K and 2 GPa for 30 min.

The amount of hydrogen incorporated into the resulting samples was evaluated by thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS; ESCO TDS1200). Approximately 5 mg of the sample was heated to 1373 K at a heating rate of 60 K/min under vacuum <10^{-6} Pa. Hydrogen released from the sample, in the form of H_{2} molecules, was ionized and detected by a quadrupole mass spectrometer as an ion with mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) = 2. Other nonhydrogen elemental compositions (Sm: Fe: As: P: O) were determined by a electron-probe microanalyzer (EPMA; JEOL model JXA-8530F) equipped with a field-emission-type electron gun and wavelength dispersive x-ray detector. The micrometer-scale compositions within the main phase were probed on five to 10 focal points, and the results were averaged.

Phase purity of the resulting samples was determined by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker diffractometer model D8 ADVANCE (Cu rotating anode). The crystallographic parameters of the synthesized 1111-type compounds were determined by Rietveld analysis of XRD patterns using TOPAS code [26], assuming a tetragonal symmetry (space group of P4/mmnz, lattice parameters a = b\approx 0.39 nm and c\approx 0.84 nm) with atomic positions of Sm (1/4, 1/4, 25m), Fe (3/4, 1/4, 1/2), Pn (1/4, 1/4, z_{Pn}), and O (3/4, 1/4, 0). During the refinement of structural parameters, site occupancies of Pn and O sites were fixed to the values estimated by the EPMA.

Four-probe dc resistivity (\rho) and magnetic susceptibility (\chi) were measured in the temperature range 2-300 K, using a physical properties measurement system (Quantum Design, Inc.) with a vibrating sample magnetometer attachment.

## III Results and Discussion

### P-substitution effect on \alpha and h_{Pn}

Using high pressure techniques, we obtained polycrystalline pellets containing >80 weight% of the 1111-type phase of SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} (0 \leqx< 0.5). The elemental composition analysis indicates that actual phosphorous content y tended to be less than the nominal content y_{\rm nom} of the starting mixtures. As a result, we obtained samples with y values of \approx0.23, \approx0.45, and \approx0.53 from starting mixtures with y_{\rm nom} = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.6, respectively. The composition analysis is described in detail in the Supplemental Material [27]. The amount of oxide vacancies measured almost matched the hydrogen content, indicating that the oxide ions are successfully replaced by hydride to form SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x}. Previous neutron diffraction analysis and density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the hydrogen exclusively replaces O^{2-} sites in the form of H^{-} ions and supplies an electron to the Fe_Pn_ layer to maintain charge neutrality [21].

Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show the variations in the lattice parameters (a and c) and z coordinate of Sm and Pn sites (z_{\rm Sm} and z_{Pn}) as a function of x in SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} specified by y = 0, \approx0.23, \approx0.45, and \approx0.53. With increases in x, the lattice parameters decrease, and the z coordinates increase, i.e., Sm_{\rm O} and Fe_Pn__{4} tetrahedra become stretched along the c axis upon compression of the crystal lattice. With increases in y, a(x) and c(x) curves are shifted down, and the z_{\rm Sm}(x) curve is shifted up, indicating that the effects of P substitution on these parameters are the same as those of H substitution. In contrast, the effect of P substitution on z_{Pn} is the opposite to that of H substitution. Because P-substitution effects are the same as those of La and Ce substitution of Sm sites, the ranges of the geometric parameters of Fe_Pn__{4} tetrahedron, i.e., \alpha and h_{Pn} in SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x}, partially overlap with those of the LnFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} (Ln = La-Sm) system.

Figure 2 shows \alpha vs h_{Pn} plots for LnFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} and SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x}. All the points of LnFeAsO_{1-x}H are located within a narrow bandlike region corresponding to r_{\rm Fe\text{-}}_Pn_ = 0.239-0.243 nm. In contrast to Ln or H substitution, which increases r_{\rm Fe\text{-}}_Pn_ (+2 pm for 50% H substitution and full substitution of La to Sm), P substitution decreases r_{\rm Fe\text{-}}_Pn_ (-7 pm for 50% P substitution) and expands the observable range in (\alpha, h_{Pn}) space to allow investigation of the structural dependence of the T_{c}-dome shape.

### P-substitution effect on T_{c}-dome shape

Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of resistivity for y\approx 0.23. At x=0, a kink in resistivity due to structural-magnetic transitions was observed around 00 K. As x increases, a sudden drop in resistivity to zero was observed at x>0.11. The maximum onset T_{c} was 44.5 K at x=0.20, and this decreased to <2 K at x=0.38. For y\approx 0.45, as shown in Fig. 3(b), superconductivity was also observed at x>0.08. The T_{c} decreased from 22.5 K at x=0.08 to 18 K at x=0.16 but subsequently increased to 24 K at x=0.21. Finally, T_{c} decreased to <2 K at x=0.43. A similar drop in T_{c} at x=0.16 was also observed for y\approx 0.53 [see Fig. 3(c)]. T_{c}=4 K was observed at x=0.15 between x=0.12 and 0.18, showing T_{c}^{\max}=14 K [27]. It is notable that a drop of resistivity was observed at \approx5 K in the x = 0.0 sample with y\approx 0.53. Because a drop in magnetic susceptibility was not observed in this temperature region, it is likely to originate from an AFM transition of Sm^{3+} spins similar to that observed in SmFePO [28]. Behavior observed in \chi-T profiles also reflected the development of bulk superconductivity, as shown in Figs. 3(d)-3(f). A drop in susceptibility due to SC transitions was observed at the magnetic onset T_{c}mag, which was slightly lower than the resistivity onset T_{c}. As shown in Figs. 3(e) and 3(f), a drop of T_{c}mag was observed at x=0.15-0.16 for y\approx 0.45 and 0.53. Figure 4 summarizes the magnetic onset T_{c}mag as a function of x. A T_{c}mag (x) curve for y=0 taken from a previous paper [22] is also shown in this

Inset is a drawing of edge-shared Fe Pn_{4} tetrahedra in L\muFePnO with notation of \alpha (Pn-Fe-Pn), \beta (another Pn-Fe-Pn), and \gamma (Fe-Pn-Fe) angles and pnictogen height h_{Pn}. Lines are guides to the eye, tracing the \alpha-h_{Pa} relation for specified y and Ln. In L\muFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x}, the change in Fe-As bond length is small (r_{\rm Fe-Pn} = 0.239â€“0.243 mm), and h_{Pb} is strongly linked to \alpha. By replacing As by P, r_{\rm Fe-Pn} clearly decreases.

 figure. In contrast to the single dome-shaped SC region for y = 0 and \approx0.23, a small valley is found at the center of the SC region in the y\approx 0.45 system. The split of the SC region was enhanced by further increase in y and the non-SC region (T_{c}< 2 K) was found at x\approx 0.16 in the y\approx 0.53 series.

### T_{c} valley on x-\alpha and x-h_{Pa} spaces

Figure 5(a) is an \alpha vs x plot for SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} and LnFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x}. The symbol size of each point represents the T_{c} value. Because of the chemical pressure effect of H substitution, the \alpha(x) curve of SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} has a negative slope, and its intercept \alpha_{0} at x=0 increases with P or La/Ce substitution of Sm sites. Therefore, the ranges of \alpha(x) curves for y= 0.23-0.53 overlap with those for Ln = La, Ce. The regions of the T_{c} valleys for y= 0.45 and 0.53 are denoted by a light blue area and those for Ln = La by a light pink area. Both regions are clearly located at the same area around (x, \alpha) = (\approx0.16, \approx113^{\circ}). In other words, double dome-shaped T_{c}(x) curves are observed when the \alpha(x) curve has a relatively large \alpha_{0} (>114^{\circ}) and passes through the region around (\approx0.16, \approx113^{\circ}). Figure 5(b) is an analogous x vs h_{Pa} plot. In x-h_{Pa} space, the T_{c} valley for y= 0.45-0.53 is located at a position with different h_{Pa} (0.130 nm for y= 0.45-0.53; 0.134 nm for Ln = La). In addition, a drop of T_{c} is not observed in the y\approx 0.23 series, while their h_{Pa}(x) curve crosses the region of the T_{c} valley of LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x}. These results indicate that the emergence of a T_{c} valley depends on \alpha and not h_{Pa}, irrespective of the Pn anion and Ln cation species.

Finally, we discuss the effects of \alpha on T_{c}. Parallel to this study, we have discovered the AFM ordering of iron spins with Neel temperature T_{N} up to 89 K in electron over-doped LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} (x= 0.45 and 0.51) [29]. The magnetic phase has a unique noncentrosymmetric structure different from that of the conventional AFM phase located at x\sim 0.0. This result suggests that the first and the second T_{c} domes in LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} come from different parent phases. Based on this idea, the result of the present study indicates that the T_{c} valley is a position where two SC phases encounter with each other, and their relationship becomes noncompetitive with the decrease of \alpha. Because of the relationship between \alpha and T_{c} in LnFePnO_{1-x}H_{x}, the "pairing glue" that induces superconductivity appears to depend on \alpha. A candidate for this glue is the electron-phonon interaction associated with \alpha. Saito _et al._ suggested in their orbital fluctuation theory that electron-phonon interactions are strongest when the FeAs_{1} tetrahedron has a regular shape (\alpha=109.5^{\circ}) [30]. This theory can empirically explain the maximum T_{c} occurring when \alpha is 109.5^{\circ}. However, in comparing the \alpha and x dependence of T_{c}, the resulting T_{c}-\alpha relation is not monotonic but does depend on x. Another possibility is spin fluctuation enhanced by hopping between Fe 3d orbitals via As 4p orbitals. The hopping integral, i.e., the overlap integral of Fe 3d and As 4p orbitals, is directly determined by the Fe-As-Fe angle \gamma having a one-to-one relation with \alpha: sin(\gamma/2)= 1/\sqrt{2}\cdot\sin(\alpha/2). In Fig. 5(a), the right vertical axis represents the \gamma value corresponding to \alpha, and we can confirm that the T_{c} valley is located at \gamma\sim 72^{\circ}.

Very recently, a calculation using the fluctuation exchange approximation successfully reproduced the shape variation of T_{c}-x with \alpha in a LnFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} system from a double dome shape at large \alpha to a single dome shape at small \alpha[31]. The primary suggestion by this calculation is that the spin-fluctuation enhancement mechanism is different between low x and high x regions. The spin fluctuation in the former

The region of the T_{c} valley for SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} is denoted by a light blue area around (x, \alpha) = (0.16, 113), which overlaps with that of LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} (denoted by a light pink colored area). (b) h_{Pa} vs x plot. The regions of the T_{c} valleys in each system do not overlap.

  region is caused by nesting of a Fermi surface composed of Fe 3d_{xz,yz} and 3d_{xy} orbitals, while that of the latter originates from real space motion of electrons within the 3d_{xy} orbitals, i.e., next-nearest-neighbor diagonal hopping (t_{2}) dominates the nearest-neighbor hopping (t_{1}). In this scheme, \alpha plays an important role in determining the magnitude of spin fluctuations and T_{c} because both t_{2} and indirect t_{1} (t_{1}^{\rm indirect}) are controlled by hopping via As 4p orbitals. Given the experimental findings and the theoretical real-space picture of electronic spin, \alpha is the decisive factor for the shape variation of T_{c}-x in LnFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} systems.

## IV Summary

We found a double dome-shaped SC region in the x-T diagram of SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} with y=0.45 and 0.53. This finding agrees with previous results on LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x}. By investigating the correlation between T_{c} and structural parameters of the Fe Pn_{4} tetrahedron, we confirmed that the T_{c} valley separating the two SC domes is located at x\approx 0.16 and \alpha\approx 113^{\circ} in both SmFeAs_{1-y}P_{y}O_{1-x}H_{x} and LaFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} systems. These results indicate that the emergence of two SC domes is generally induced in 1111-type iron oxypnictides when the electron-doping level matches the shape of the Fe Pn_{4} tetrahedron.
