###### Abstract

Understanding the formation of Cooper pairs in iron-based
superconductors is one of the most important topics in condensed matter
physics. In conventional superconductors, the electron-phonon
interaction leads to the formation of Cooper pairs. In conventional
strong-coupling superconductors like lead (Pb), the features due to
electron-phonon interaction are evident in the infrared absorption
spectra. Here we investigate the infrared absorption spectra of the iron
arsenide superconductor BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂. We find that this
superconductor has fully gapped (nodeless) Fermi surfaces, and we
observe the strong-coupling electron-boson interaction features in the
infrared absorption spectra. Through modeling with the Eliashberg
function based on Eliashberg theory, we obtain a good quantitative
description of the energy gaps and the strong-coupling features. The
full Eliashberg equations are solved to check the self-consistency of
the electron-boson coupling spectrum, the largest energy gap, and the
transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$). Our experimental data and analysis
provide compelling evidence that superconductivity in
BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂ is induced by the coupling of electrons to a
low-energy bosonic mode that does not originate solely from phonons.

## I Introduction

Nearly half a century after the experimental discovery of
superconductivity, Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS) developed a
model to explain this phenomenon [1]. The BCS mechanism provides a
microscopic description of weak-coupling, phonon-mediated
superconductivity in conventional superconductors. Subsequently,
Eliashberg [2, 3] proposed a more realistic model of the superconducting
state that includes the retarded nature of the phonon induced
interaction applicable to conventional strong-coupling superconductors
like lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg). The agreement of the parameters in the
self-consistent solutions of the Eliashberg equations, for example, in
Pb, with experimental results like the phonon density of states from
inelastic neutron scattering [4], electronic density of states from
tunneling experiments [3], electronic heat capacity enhancement [3], and
infrared absorption [5] provide strong evidence for the electron-phonon
mechanism of superconductivity in conventional superconductors.

For the iron-based superconductors, it has been argued that phonons
alone cannot explain the high transition temperatures [6, 7]. Spin and
orbital fluctuations are currently the popular candidates for mediating
the formation of Cooper pairs [6, 7]. There is some experimental
evidence that collective spin fluctuations may be the bosons that
mediate the formation of Cooper pairs. These experiments include
inelastic neutron scattering studies on both electron- and hole-doped
iron pnictides [8, 9, 10, 11], scanning tunneling spectroscopy [12], and
specific heat measurements of hole (K) -doped BaFe₂As₂[13], and
quasiparticle interference imaging in LiFeAs [14].

There have been a number of infrared studies on iron-based
superconductors [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,
29]. However, they have not reported clear evidence of strong
electron-boson coupling features in the infrared absorption data in the
superconducting state normalized to the infrared absorption data in the
normal state. Such features are expected to occur if superconductivity
is mediated by collective bosonic excitations. Although the larger
gap(s) in the iron-based superconductors are in the strong-coupling
regime, only a limited number of infrared studies have considered
strong-coupling approaches to model the data [17, 18, 19, 25, 26, 27].
The strong-coupling methods were originally developed for strong
electron-phonon interactions but they are believed to describe the
coupling of electrons to any bosonic spectrum. In a few studies,
researchers have obtained the electron-boson spectral density from the
scattering rate only in the normal state [17, 25, 26, 27]. One recent
work [18] provides a method to find the electron-boson interaction both
in the normal and superconducting states from the infrared scattering
rate (or self-energy). However, this work does not check if the
electron-boson spectral density function is self-consistent with the
energy gap by solving the full Eliashberg equations. Charmukha _et
al._[19] have used a multiband Eliashberg theory to fit the optical
conductivity to support the spin-fluctuation mechanism. Their model only
qualitatively describes the real part of the optical conductivity in the
superconducting state.

Previous experiments on high-quality single crystals of superconducting
BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂ reveal two isotropic gaps, one 2-3 meV and the
other 5-7 meV [30]. Here we report infrared spectroscopy data on
BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂ that is consistent with multiband
superconductivity with isotropic gaps. The important finding is that we
observe strong-coupling electron-boson interaction features when the
infrared absorption spectra in the superconducting state are normalized
to the infrared absorption spectrum in the normal state. The
frequency-dependent infrared absorption (A) is simply A = 1 − R where
the frequency-dependent infrared reflectance (R) is directly measured in
the experiments. We identify a bosonic mode centered about 5 meV that
provides the pairing glue in superconducting BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂. We
employ theoretical modeling of the absorption spectra within the Allen
formalism [18, 31] and Zimmermann formalism [32] based on Eliashberg
theory. The full isotropic Eliashberg equations are solved to check the
self-consistency of the Eliashberg function (electron-boson spectral
density function), the largest energy gap, and $T_{\rm c}$.

## II Samples and experiments

Single crystals of BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂ were grown using the FeAs
self-flux method, which is described in Refs. [30, 33] along with x-ray,
transport, magnetic, and thermodynamic measurements. The dc resistivity
data show the onset of superconductivity at $T_{\rm c}=23$ K [30, 33].
Magnetic susceptibility measurements show bulk superconductivity with
full volume fraction [30, 33]. The ab-plane reflectance at various
temperatures from 300 to 5 K was obtained in a home-built cryogenic
setup with a Bruker Vertex 80v Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectrometer in the frequency range 20-8000 cm⁻¹ (2.5-990 meV) using the
technique of _in situ_ gold evaporation [34]. Cryogenic ellipsometry was
performed in a homebuilt vacuum chamber with a Woollam variable-angle
spectroscopic ellipsometer in the energy range 0.6-6 eV [34].

## III Experimental results, modeling, and discussion

### Infrared reflectance and absorption

The ab-plane infrared reflectance of a BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂ crystal is
shown in Fig. 1. In the normal state at T = 25 K, BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂
is highly reflective at low frequencies consistent with metallic
behavior as in other metallic iron arsenides [15, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25,
26, 27, 28, 29, 34]. At T = 5 K, well below $T_{\rm c}$,
superconductivity leads to changes in the spectrum at frequencies below
≈250 cm⁻¹. Superconductivity is observed directly from perfect
reflectance at frequencies below 31.5 cm⁻¹ in the T = 5 K spectrum. The
data are consistent with a fully gapped (nodeless) superconductor close
to the dirty limit [20, 22, 35, 36]. Features at ≈260 and ≈320 cm⁻¹ are
observed in the normal state spectrum and these features are nearly
unchanged in the superconducting state spectrum. The feature at ≈260
cm⁻¹ is due to an infrared-active phonon. The somewhat broader feature
at ≈320 cm⁻¹ is possibly due to a weak optical interband transition.

The absorption in the superconducting state A_(S)(T) for $T<T_{\rm c}$
is obtained from the equation A_(S)(T) = 1 − R_(S)(T), where R_(S)(T) is
the reflectance in the superconducting state. Similarly, the normal
state absorption A_(N)(T = 25 K) is obtained from A_(N)(25 K) =
1 − R_(N)(25 K). The ratio A_(S)(5 K)/A_(N)(25 K) is plotted as a
function of frequency in Fig. 2. There are clear features at 80-200 cm⁻¹
which are larger than the error bars [see Fig. 2(b)]. The sharp peak at
87 cm⁻¹ is due to the largest gap. Above this gap feature, we observe a
"valley-peak-valley" structure. When

superconducting state (T = 5 K) normalized to infrared absorption in the
normal state (T = 25 K). Also shown are fits to the experimental data
using four different methods described in the text. The Eliashberg
functions α²F shown in (a) consist of one sharp, large peak and one
smaller, broad peak in the superconducting state for both Allen
formalism and Zimmermann formalism. (b) Zoomed-in view of the
valley-peak-valley region (≈90–200 cm⁻¹) in the normalized absorption

frequencies are also shown in (b).

and T = 25 K in a wider spectral range.

we compare our normalized infrared absorption data of
BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂ to the normalized infrared absorption data of the
well-known conventional strong-coupling superconductor lead (Pb) (Refs.
[5,31]), we see they are remarkably similar. In Pb, acoustic phonons are
the bosonic modes which mediate the formation of Cooper pairs, and the
valleys in the absorption data are due to the peaks in the phonon
density of states shifted by the gap 2Δ. Hence, the valleys in the
absorption data of BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂ roughly correspond to peaks in
the density of states of bosonic modes shifted by the largest gap 2Δ₃.

In the following Secs. III.2 and III.3, two different models have been
applied to fit the normalized absorption of BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂, in
order to quantitatively determine the bosonic mode coupled to the
electrons.

### Modeling strong-coupling features with Allen formalism

In order to quantitatively study the bosonic modes in superconducting
BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂ and obtain a fit to the experimental normalized
absorption, we start from Allen’s formalism (optical self-energy method)
generalized to multiband conductivity [18,31,37]. The imaginary part of
the optical self-energy is

$$\Sigma_{2}^{op}(\omega,T) = -\frac{1}{2}\Bigg{[}\int_{0}^{\infty}d\Omega\alpha^{2}F(\Omega,T) K(\omega,\Omega,T) +\frac{1}{\tau_{\mathrm{imp}}^{op}(\omega)}\Bigg{]},$$

where α²F(Ω, T) is the Eliashberg function (electron-boson spectral
density function), K(ω, Ω, T) is the kernel of Allen’s integral
equation, and 1/τ_(imp)^(op)(ω) is the impurity scattering rate [18].
Equation (1) is applicable to both the normal phase and the
superconducting phase, but K(ω, Ω, T) and 1/τ_(imp)^(op)(ω) are
different for the two phases:

$$K(\omega,\Omega,T) = \frac{\pi}{\omega}\Bigg{[}2\omega\coth\left(\frac{\Omega}{2T} \right)-(\omega+\Omega)\coth\left(\frac{\omega+\Omega}{2T}\right)$$
(for normal state),
$$K(\omega,\Omega,T) = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}(\omega-\Omega)\Theta(\omega-2\Delta-\Omega)$$
(for superconducting state at
T = 0K
), where
Θ(x)
represents the Heaviside step function,
E(x)
represents the complete elliptic integral of the second kind, and
Δ
is the energy gap. The impurity scattering rate is
1/τ_(imp)^(op)(ω) = 1/τ_(imp)(for normal state),
(3a)
$$1/\tau_{\mathrm{imp}}^{op}(\omega)=(1/\tau_{\mathrm{imp}})\ E \left[\frac{\sqrt{\omega^{2}-(2\Delta)^{2}}}{\omega}\right]$$
(3b) (for superconducting state at
T = 0 K
),

in which 1/τ_(imp) is a constant. Then the real part of the optical
self-energy can be obtained by the Kramers-Kronig transformation:

$$\Sigma_{1}^{op}(\omega)=-\frac{2\omega}{\pi}\,P\int_{0}^{\infty}d\Omega\frac{ \Sigma_{2}^{op}(\omega)}{\Omega^{2}-\omega^{2}}.$$
(4)

The complex optical conductivity for one channel is

$$\bar{\sigma}(\omega)=\frac{\omega_{p}^{2}}{8\pi i}\frac{1}{\tilde{\Sigma}^{op }(\omega)-\omega/2},$$
(5)

where ω_(p) is the plasma frequency in one channel and
Σ̃^(op)(ω) = Σ₁^(op)(ω) + i Σ₂^(op)(ω). The total conductivity is the sum
of different channels (here we have three channels due to the multiband
nature of this material):

σ̄_(total)(ω) = σ̄_(cf1)(ω) + σ̄_(cf2)(ω) + σ̄_(cf3)(ω).
(6)

We then add the contributions of the interband transitions from the
experimental data at higher frequencies to the total low-frequency
conductivity calculated from the model. The reflectance is calculated
from the real and imaginary parts of the total optical conductivity
(Appendix B). The absorption is calculated from the reflectance.

In both normal state and superconducting state, the Eliashberg function
α²F(Ω) only appears in the optical self-energy of the largest gap
channel, while for the two smaller gap channels only impurity scattering
is considered in the optical self-energy. The parameters in the fit are
as follows: the impurity scattering rate (1/τ_(imp) = 370 cm⁻¹)
consistent with the experimental data, the weights of the square of the
total plasma frequency in each conductivity channel, and the three
energy gaps in the superconducting state (discussed below). The total
plasma frequency of 1.45 eV is obtained from the low-frequency optical
conductivity data at T = 25 K in the normal state (Appendix A). Our best
fits to the normalized absorption data and the corresponding Eliashberg
function α²F(Ω) are shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). The smallest gap
2Δ₁ = 31.5 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the onset of absorption and the largest
gap 2Δ₃ = 87 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the peak at 87 cm⁻¹ in the normalized
absorption data. A third gap with energy 2Δ₂ = 58 cm⁻¹ is required to
fit the shoulder around 60 cm⁻¹. However, Δ₂ is associated with the
Fermi surface with a small spectral weight (10

The ratio 2Δ₃/k_(B)T_(c) = 5.44 is clearly in the strong-coupling limit
compared to the BCS weak-coupling value of 3.53. The ratios of the other
two gaps to T_(c) are either smaller than (2Δ₁/k_(B)T_(c) = 1.97) or
close to (2Δ₂/k_(B)T_(c) = 3.63) the BCS weak-coupling value. This
justifies using the Eliashberg function only in the conductivity channel
associated with the largest energy gap Δ₃. In order to fit the two
valleys in the experimental normalized absorption spectrum, the
Eliashberg function in the superconducting state consists of two
Gaussian peaks: one large and sharp mode centered at frequency
Ω₁ = 46 cm⁻¹ and one broad, weaker mode centered at frequency
Ω₂ = 121 cm⁻¹. These two peaks approximately correspond to the two
valleys respectively centered at frequencies 115 cm⁻¹ (≈Ω₁ + 2Δ₃) and
180 cm⁻¹ (≈Ω₂ + 2Δ₃) in the calculated normalized absorption spectrum.
In order to obtain the correct absolute value of normalized absorption,
only the weak, broad peak is necessary in the Eliashberg function for
the normal state. Here we discuss the calculated normalized absorption
using three methods while keeping the same energy gaps: the multiband
Allen formalism including both electron-boson interaction and impurity
scattering $1/\tau_{\rm c,min}^{gp}(\omega)$, the multiband Allen
formalism with only impurity scattering, and multiband Mattis-Bardeen
theory [41] (with constant normal state conductivity σ₁ = 6000 Ω⁻¹ cm⁻¹
consistent with the low-frequency conductivity data at T = 25 K shown in
Appendix A). The multiband Mattis-Bardeen theory assumes the gaps are
isotropic s-wave gaps in the weak-coupling limit, and the total
conductivity is the superposition of the different superconducting
channels. The multiband Mattis-Bardeen theory has been applied to
iron-based superconductors previously [16, 20, 21, 22, 28, 42]. The
model fits are compared in Fig. 2. Neither multiple band Mattis-Bardeen
theory nor the Allen formalism with only impurity scattering capture the
valley-peak-valley features in the normalized absorption data. The
introduction of electron-boson interaction to the optical self-energy
for the largest gap is required to fit the valley-peak-valley features
between ≈90 and 200 cm⁻¹.

Since the Allen formalism is expected to provide only an approximate
quantitative description of strong-coupling superconductors [18, 31], we
take the important step to check the self-consistency of the energy gap
and the Eliashberg function α²F(Ω) used in the Allen formalism by
solving the full Eliashberg equations. For this we assume an isotropic
energy gap consistent with experiments [30] and the effective Coulomb
pseudopotential μ^(*) = 0.1[43]. The Eliashberg equations are solved
using epw4.2 as described in Ref. [43]. The renormalization function
Z(ω) and the superconducting gap Δ(ω) are first solved on an imaginary
energy axis and then an analytic continuation is performed to the real
axis. The solved gap function is 2Δ(ω = 0) = 85 cm⁻¹, which is almost
identical to the largest gap 2Δ₃. We also calculate $T_{\rm c}$ from the
Eliashberg function. The lower limit of $T_{\rm c}$ can be estimated
from McMillan’s formula [44],

$$T_{\rm c,min}=\frac{\langle\omega\rangle}{1.20}\exp[-1.04(1+\lambda)/(\lambda- \mu^{*}-0.62\lambda\mu^{*})],$$
(7)

where μ^(*) is assumed to be 0.1, and

$$\lambda=2\int_{0}^{\infty}{\rm d}\Omega\;\alpha^{2}F(\Omega)/\Omega,$$
(8)
$$\langle\omega\rangle=\left\{\int_{0}^{\infty}{\rm d}\Omega\;\alpha ^{2}F(\Omega)\right\}/\left\{\int_{0}^{\infty}{\rm d}\Omega\alpha^{2}F(\Omega )/\Omega\right\}.$$
(9)

Thus we obtain $T_{\rm c,min}=17.1\,$K. An upper limit of $T_{\rm c}$ is
given by the generalized McMillan equation [18, 44],

$$k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c,max}\congeq 1.13\hbar\omega_{\rm n}\exp[-(1+\lambda)/\lambda],$$
(10)

where

$$\omega_{ln}=\exp\biggl{[}(2/\lambda)\int_{0}^{\infty}{\rm d}\Omega\;\ln\Omega \alpha^{2}F(\Omega)/\Omega\biggr{]},$$
(11)

and this gives $T_{\rm c,max}=24.6\,$K. The estimates of $T_{\rm c}$ are
consistent with the experimental transition temperature of 23 K.

### Modeling strong-coupling features with Zimmermann formalism

In order to confirm the results of the modeling based on the Allen
formalism, we apply a second approach to model our data: the formalism
of Lee, Rainer, and Zimmermann [32] (we call it Zimmermann formalism in
this article) to calculate the optical conductivity in the
strong-coupling regime. The Zimmermann formalism has advantages in that
it is self-consistent and incorporates temperature dependence in the
superconducting state. Similar results to the Zimmerman formalism have
been derived by Marsiglio [45] and Schachinger and Carbotte [46], which
indicate the robustness and significance of the formalism. The
temperature-dependent complex conductivity in the superconducting state
takes the following expression [32, 47]:

$$\sigma(\omega,T) = \frac{\omega_{p}^{2}}{16\pi^{3}\omega_{0}}\int_{-\infty}^{+ \infty}d\varepsilon\left\{\tanh\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{2k_{\rm B}T}\right)M( \varepsilon,\omega)\right.$$
(12)
×[g(ε)g(ε + ω) + h(ε)h(ε + ω) + π²]
$$- \tanh\left(\frac{\varepsilon+\omega}{2k_{\rm B}T}\right)M^{*}( \varepsilon,\omega)[g^{*}(\varepsilon)g^{*}(\varepsilon+\omega)$$
$$+ h^{*}(\varepsilon)h^{*}(\varepsilon+\omega)+\pi^{2}]+\left[\tanh \left(\frac{\varepsilon+\omega}{2k_{\rm B}T}\right)\right.$$
$$- \left.\tanh\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{2k_{\rm B}T}\right)\right]L( \varepsilon,\omega)[g^{*}(\varepsilon)g(\varepsilon+\omega)$$
$$+ h^{*}(\varepsilon)h(\varepsilon+\omega)+\pi^{2}]\biggr{\}}$$

where ω_(p) is the plasma frequency in one conductivity channel and

$$g(\varepsilon) = \frac{-\pi\tilde{\varepsilon}(\varepsilon)}{\sqrt{\tilde{\Delta}^ {2}(\varepsilon)-\tilde{\varepsilon}^{2}(\varepsilon)}},$$
(13a)
$$h(\varepsilon) = \frac{-\pi\tilde{\Delta}(\varepsilon)}{\sqrt{\tilde{\Delta}^{2}( \varepsilon)-\tilde{\varepsilon}^{2}(\varepsilon)}},$$
(13b)
$$M(\varepsilon,\;\omega) = [\sqrt{\tilde{\Delta}^{2}(\varepsilon+\omega)-\tilde{\varepsilon}^ {2}(\varepsilon+\omega)}$$
(14a)
$$+\sqrt{\tilde{\Delta}^{2}(\varepsilon)-\tilde{\varepsilon}^{2}( \varepsilon)+1/\tau}]^{-1},$$
$$L(\varepsilon,\;\omega) = [\sqrt{\tilde{\Delta}^{2}(\varepsilon+\omega)-\tilde{\varepsilon}^ {2}(\varepsilon+\omega)}$$
(14b)
$$+\sqrt{\tilde{\Delta}^{*2}(\varepsilon)-\tilde{\varepsilon}^{*2}( \varepsilon)}+1/\tau]^{-1},$$
in which 1/τ is the impurity, scattering rate. The quantities Δ̃ and ε̃
depend on energy ε, ε̃(ε) = εZ(ε) and Δ̃ = Z(ε)Δ(ε). The complex
renormalization function Z(ε) and superconducting gap Δ(ε) are obtained
by solving the standard Eliashberg equations for isotropic systems at
real energies. In Eq. (12), the integral is implemented on the energy
axis from negative infinity to positive infinity. The negative energy
dependence of Z(ε) and Δ(ε) can be obtained from the symmetry properties
of Z(ε) and Δ(ε). Note that the real part of both Z(ε) and Δ(ε) are even
functions of energy, and the imaginary parts of both Z(ε) and Δ(ε) are
odd functions of energy [48, 49].

For the normal state, the conductivity can be expressed as

$$\sigma_{N}(\omega,\ T) = \frac{{\omega_{p}}^{2}}{8\pi\omega}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}d \varepsilon\bigg{[}\tanh\bigg{(}\frac{\varepsilon+\omega}{2k_{\rm B}T}\bigg{)}$$
(15)
$$-\ \tanh\bigg{(}\frac{\varepsilon}{2k_{\rm B}T}\bigg{)}\bigg{]}M_{N}(\varepsilon,\ \omega),$$

where

M_(N)(ε, ω) = [−iε̃_(N)(ε + ω) + iε̃_(N)^(*)(ε) + 1/τ]⁻¹,
(16)

and ε̃_(N)(ε) is defined by

$$\tilde{\varepsilon}_{N}(\varepsilon) = \varepsilon+\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}d\Omega\ \alpha^{2}F(\Omega)\bigg{[}i\pi\cot\bigg{(}\frac{\Omega}{2k_{\rm B}T}\bigg{)}$$
$$-\ \Psi\bigg{(}\frac{1}{2}+i\frac{-\varepsilon+\Omega}{2\pi k_{\rm B}T}\bigg{)}+\Psi\bigg{(}\frac{1}{2}+i\frac{-\varepsilon-\Omega}{2\pi k_{\rm B}T}\bigg{)}\bigg{]},$$

in which α²F(Ω) is the Eliashberg function and Ψ(x) is the digamma
function. Negative energy dependence of α²F(Ω) can also be obtained from
symmetry properties of α²F(Ω). Note that α²F(Ω) is an odd function of
frequency (energy) [50].

For the simulation based on the Zimmermann approach, the following
parameters were used for the strong-coupling channel with the largest
gap Δ₃: ω_(p)² is 35

Our models based on the Allen and Zimmermann formalisms quantitatively
describe the energy gaps and the strong-coupling features in the
experimental data (see Fig. 2). However, we note that the model based on
the Allen formalism gives a better fit to the experimental data compared
to the model based on the Zimmermann formalism.

### Origin of the bosonic modes

Next we discuss the origin of the two peaks in the Eliashberg function.
The promising candidates for bosons which mediate the formation of
Cooper pairs are either spin fluctuations or orbital fluctuations
(induced by Fe phonons). Spin resonance modes have been determined by
inelastic neutron scattering experiments [8, 9, 10, 11]. The spin
resonance, which is observed only in the superconducting state in
cuprates, heavy-fermion, and iron-based superconductors, is generally
considered a feedback effect from superconductivity. Despite some
theoretical controversies, the resonance is viewed as a spin-exciton
bound state in the particle-hole channel. The appearance of the
resonance implies a sign change of superconducting gap(s) between either
different patches of the Fermi surface or different Fermi pockets
connected by a resonance mode at momentum q (see Ref. [51] and
references therein). From the modeling of our infrared absorption data,
the large sharp peak in the Eliashberg function of BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂
is centered at 5.1 ± 0.6 meV (41 ± 5 cm⁻¹), with a full width at half
maximum of 1 meV, and is only present in the superconducting state. We
note that the spin resonance mode at 3D antiferromagnetic ordering wave
vector Q = (1, 0,  − 1) occurs in BaFe_(1.9)Ni_(0.1)As₂ (a
superconductor with $T_{\rm c}=20$ K and similar to
BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂), with resonance energy
$\hbar\omega_{\rm res}=7\pm 0.5$ meV, and width d = 1.9 ± 0.7 meV [8].
Inelastic neutron scattering experiments on BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂ are
not available at present. If the bosonic mode we have observed is due to
spin fluctuations, then we expect that a spin resonance mode about 5 meV
will be observed in future inelastic neutron scattering experiments. The
center frequency of the bosonic mode in our infrared experiments is also
not that different from the spin resonance mode of another
electron-doped material Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ which is ∼8-9 meV [10,
11]. Note that the bosonic mode observed in the optical response is the
q averaged (all momenta in the Brillouin zone) local susceptibility.
From the above discussion, we infer that the sharp peak about 5 meV in
the Eliashberg function of BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂ possibly represents the
spin resonance in the superconducting state. The important point is that
the 5-meV peak cannot be due to phonons alone because it is lower in
energy compared to the energy of the lowest peak in the phonon density
of states in the parent compound or doped BaFe₂As₂[52, 53]. Moreover,
since phonons are present in both the normal and superconducting states,
the 5-meV peak cannot be due to phonons alone because it is only
required in modeling the superconducting state data and not required for
modeling the normal state data.

The broad, weak peak in α²F(Ω) is centered at 15 meV (121 cm⁻¹), with a
width of 5 meV, and is required in the models for both the
superconducting and normal states. Inelastic x-ray scattering
experiments have measured the lowest-energy peak in the Fe phonon
density of states centered at 13 meV, with width approximately 5 meV.
The phonon density of states is nearly temperature independent [54].
Phonons are likely the origin of the weak, broad mode. Actually, the
position and the width of the broad peak are also very similar to the
prediction of the resonance peak of the s₊₊ wave pairing state [55].
Possible explanations are that the weak, broad mode is either due to
electron-phonon interaction or due to phonon induced orbital
fluctuations. Note that the total electron-boson coupling constant
λ = 3.5-4.3 contains a significant contribution of 2.8-3.6 from the
sharp peak, and a minor contribution of only 0.7 from the broad peak. If
the sharp peak in the Eliashberg function is due to spin fluctuations,
this means spin fluctuations play the dominant role in superconductivity
in BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂. It would also support the presence of a
predominant s_(±) gap in superconducting BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂[6].
However, we note that superconductivity with relatively high $T_{\rm c}$
is preserved in the presence of large impurity scattering in
BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂. This is more consistent with an s₊₊ pairing state
because the s_(±) pairing state is expected to be fragile against
impurities due to interband scattering [56].

### Temperature-dependent features

Finally, we study the temperature dependence of the normalized
absorption spectra. The absorption spectra in the superconducting state
at T = 5, 10, 15, and 20 K, are normalized to the normal state
absorption data (T = 25 K) and plotted in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). It is
clear that the amplitude of the strong-coupling features due to
electron-boson interaction decreases when temperature increases toward
$T_{\rm c}$. However, there is little frequency dependence of these
features for temperatures at and below 15 K. At T = 20 K, still below
$T_{\rm c}$, the strong-coupling features weaken further and move to
lower frequencies. This may be caused by a reduction of the energy gap
Δ₃ magnitude and a downward shift in center frequency Ω₁ of the bosonic
peak as the temperature approaches $T_{\rm c}$ from below. The Allen
formalism for the superconducting state is meant for T = 0 K and works
well for temperatures much below $T_{\rm c}$. To the best of our
knowledge, the Allen formalism for the superconducting state at higher
temperatures does not exist at present. Hence, we cannot quantitatively
model the temperature dependence of the bosonic mode based on the Allen
formalism. Nevertheless, we attempt to follow the temperature dependence
of the energy gaps using two alternative methods discussed below. The
first method is based on Mattis-Bardeen theory. The second method based
on the Zimmerman formalism also allows us to model the temperature
dependence of the low-energy bosonic mode.

In the first method, the temperature-dependent energy gap 2Δ₃(T) is
estimated directly from the normalized absorption because it corresponds
to the first prominent peak position [shown by arrows in Fig. 3(b)] and
is plotted in Fig. 3(c). The temperature dependence of Δ₁ and Δ₂ cannot
be obtained directly from the data. However, since the ratio
$2\Delta/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}$ for the smaller two gaps shows they are in
the weak-coupling regime, we have modeled the normalized absorption
using three-band Mattis-Bardeen formalism (we assume the temperature
dependence of the largest gap can

be modeled with Mattis-Bardeen theory). The results are shown in Fig.
3(c) with hollow symbols. The largest and smallest gaps appear to
deviate from the BCS prediction close to $T_{\rm c}$.

Since the Mattis-Bardeen description does not capture the temperature
dependence of the strong-coupling features and the low-energy bosonic
mode, we attempt to fit the temperature-dependent normalized absorption
using Zimmermann’s formalism for the largest gap channel. In the
modeling, we assume the low-energy bosonic mode is temperature dependent
and follows a similar functional dependence as the energy gap [10].
Temperature-dependent complex renormalization function Z(ε) and
superconducting gap Δ(ε) are obtained by solving the standard Eliashberg
equations for isotropic systems at real energies. The Zimmermann
formalism is applied in the largest energy gap channel, and the
temperature dependence of the two smaller gaps in the weak-coupling
regime are modeled using Mattis-Bardeen theory. The simulation results
are shown in Fig. 3(a). The theoretical model roughly captures the
temperature-dependent trend of the valley-peak-valley features. At
T = 10 and 15 K, the valley-peak-valley features become weaker compared
to T = 5 K simulation, while there is some frequency dependence at
T = 15 K compared to the T = 5 and 10 K simulations. At T = 20 K, a
temperature close to $T_{\rm c}$, the valley-peak-valley features are
nearly washed out in the simulation consistent with the experimental
data. The temperature dependence of the energy gaps and the bosonic mode
from the model is shown in Fig. 3(c). There are larger error bars at
higher temperatures due to uncertainty in the solution of the Eliashberg
equations using the epw software when the temperature approaches
$T_{\rm c}$.

## IV Conclusion

To conclude, we have observed temperature-dependent features in the
infrared absorption spectra arising from the energy gaps and strong
electron-boson interaction in the superconductor BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂.
This was enabled by careful, systematic cryogenic infrared reflectance
measurements. The data are consistent with three nodeless energy gaps in
the superconducting state, out of which only the largest gap is in the
strong-coupling regime. We obtain the Eliashberg function
(electron-boson spectral density function) by modeling the absorption
data with both the generalized Allen formalism and Zimmermann formalism.
The largest gap, the $T_{\rm c}$, and the Eliashberg function were
verified to be self-consistent within the Eliashberg theory. We find
that superconductivity in BaFe_(1.9)Pt_(0.1)As₂ arises primarily due to
pairing of electrons induced by a bosonic mode centered at 5.1 ± 0.6
meV. This bosonic mode cannot be attributed to phonons alone because it
occurs at an energy less than the lowest-energy peak in the phonon
density of states. The bosonic mode may originate from spin fluctuations
although we cannot rule out the role of orbital fluctuations or another
mechanism.

## Appendix A Optical conductivity

The temperature dependence of the real part of the optical conductivity
σ₁ is shown in Fig. 4. It is obtained from Kramers-Kronig transformation
of the reflectance data constrained by cryogenic ellipsometry data,
similar to the procedure described in Ref. [34]. At T = 5 K, the real
part of the conductivity is negligible below the frequency 31.5 cm⁻¹,
corresponding to the smallest gap. At higher frequencies, there is a
sharp increase of the conductivity just above the gap and subsequently
the conductivity reaches a maximum, which is a clear indication of
superconductivity in the dirty limit. Indeed, the scattering rate in the
normal state (T = 25 K) is 370 cm⁻¹ which is much larger than the energy
gaps indicating that superconductivity is in the dirty limit. In fact,
the large radius Pt ion doped into the FeAs₄ tetragon leads to
significant impurity scattering and to some degree of localization at
higher temperatures in the normal state. This can be seen from the
nonmonotonic frequency dependence of σ₁ at low frequencies in the normal
state at higher temperatures (see Fig. 4).

The inset in Fig. 4 clearly shows the "missing" spectral weight between
the normal state conductivity and the superconducting state conductiv

weight in the superconducting state is transferred into the delta
function at zero frequency which represents the superfluid response to a
dc electric field. The missing spectral weight area is equal to the
superfluid density [22],
ω_(ps)² = 8∫₀^(ω_(z))dω[σ₁(ω, T = 25 K) − σ₁(ω, T = 5 K)] = 1.9 × 10⁷ cm⁻²,
where the cutoff frequency ω_(c) = 400 cm⁻¹ is chosen so that the
integral converges smoothly. The superfluid density is consistent with
that obtained from the low-frequency limit ω_(ps)² = −ω²ε₁ (ω → 0),
where ε₁ is the real part of the dielectric function [22, 57]. We use
the Drude-Lorentz model to separate the contribution of free carriers
and interband transitions to the conductivity in the normal state
(T = 25 K) [57]. In the simplest Drude-Lorentz model, a single Drude
feature is sufficient to describe the free carrier contribution. The
superfluid density at T = 5 K is 14

## Appendix B Absolute reflectance and absorption calculated using the
two models

Absolute reflectance and absorption calculated [57] from the total
optical conductivity based on the Allen formalism and the Zimmermann
formalism in the superconducting state (T = 5 K) and normal state
(T = 25 K) are shown in Fig. 5. We have obtained quantitatively good
agreement to the absolute reflectance and absorption data using the
Allen formalism. The Zimmermann formalism agrees better with the
experimental data at lower frequencies compared to higher frequencies
(above ≈100 cm⁻¹).
