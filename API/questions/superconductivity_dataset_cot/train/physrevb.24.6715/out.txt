###### Abstract

Superconductivity is found to exist in the ternary intermetallics YbPd_{2}Ge_{2}, LaPd_{2}Ge_{2}, and LaPt_{2}Ge_{2}. Superconductivity-onset temperatures are 1.17, 1.12, and 0.55 K, respectively. Superconductivity was found neither in YbCu_{2}Ge_{2} nor in bulk CeCu_{2}Si_{2}, the latter in contrast to previously published work.

## I Introduction

CeCu_{2}Si_{2} appears to be a mixed-valent compound with the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure in which transport and heat-capacity measurements show that the charge carriers have exceptionally large effective masses, two orders of magnitude greater than typically found in _d_-band metals. It has recently been reported to become superconducting,[1] a surprising result for such strongly interactive quasiparticles, and this is suggestive that the pairing interaction might be due to a nonconventional mechanism. We have been unable to reproduce the observed superconductivity in CeCu_{2}Si_{2} above 0.47 K, the limit of our cryostat, and in conjunction with Dynes, have found the indication of only a trace of superconductivity down to 0.06 K, most likely due to the presence of a small fraction of an unidentified minority phase. In the course of this investigation we have discovered superconductivity in related RPd_{2}Ge_{2}-ordered intermetallic compounds where R is a rare earth, and in LaPt_{2}Ge_{2}, which possesses the tetragonal ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure (BaAl_{4} type),[2, 3] or a variant of this structure.[3] In the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure, the Th atoms (or R atoms) occupy one set of equivalent sites. There are many ternary phases of the form RA_{2}X_{2}, where A= Pd, Pt, Rh, Ag, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu and X= Si and Ge.[2, 3] Of interest to us in this investigation was the occurrence of superconductivity in those phases not containing magnetic 3 d elements. In particular, the lattice constant data[2] for YbPd_{2}Ge_{2} suggested that Yb is, or nearly is, divalent (a 4/^{14} ion) but charge fluctuation or mixed-valent effects (+2 = +3) perhaps could play an important role in the low-temperature properties.

## II Experimental and Results

The intermetallic compounds were prepared by induction-melting stoichiometric quantities of the constituents in vitreous carbon crucibles under one atmosphere of Ar. Melting losses were less than 1%. The as-prepared compound of YbPd_{2}Ge_{2} was always multiphase and it was necessary to perform annealing experiments. Annealing was carried out for all of the compounds in sealed quartz ampoules. For YbPd_{2}Ge_{2}, a chip of Yb metal was also placed in the ampoule, but isolated from the compound, to prevent decomposition and to scavenge residual oxygen. Powder x-ray diffractometry (Cr _Kx_ radiation) was performed to confirm the structure and to ascertain the cleanliness of the samples and metallographic studies were also performed. Superconducting critical temperatures were determined by ac induction measurements and magnetic susceptibility measurements were made using the Faraday method.

## III YbPd_{2}Ge_{2}

The superconducting onset temperatures T_{c} and transition widths, \Delta T_{c}, as well as other pertinent information are shown in Table 1. The best material was obtained by annealing for two weeks at 670 degC (sample No. 11). Even so, the diffractometer traces exhibited several very weak lines that could be indexed on the basis of the presence of very small amounts of Yb, Pd_{2}Yb_{2}, PdGe, Pd_{2}Ge, and GeO_{2}. This was confirmed by metallographic studies which indicated the presence of small amounts of other phases. One extra line, at d=2.470 A, could not be indexed on the basis of any known phase of Yb, Pd, and Ge. The intensity of this line decreased rather dramatically with annealing, but could not be completely eliminated. In sample No. 11, this line was very, very weak. DTA measurements showed that YbPd_{2}Ge_{2} undergoes three solid-state transitions before melting (at 732, 878, and 990 degC; evidence of melting obtained at 1425 degC, the limit of the DTA apparatus). We believe that the 2.470-A line may be related to the presence of a small amount of one of the untransformed elevated temperature phases.

Magnetic susceptibility studies of as-prepared and annealed samples all showed Curie-Weiss contributions to the susceptibility, but the magnitude of this  contribution decreased after annealing. It was the smallest for sample 11. If one assumes that the measured paramagnetic moments arise from Yb3+ (reasonable since LaPd_{2}Ge_{2} shows no paramagnetic moments, see below) and that the moment of Yb3+ is equal to the free ion value of 4.5_m__B_/Yb, the fraction of Yb3+ in each sample can be determined. In the as-prepared samples, 50% of the Yb is Yb3+, consistent with the large amount of second phase seen in x-ray and metallographic studies of the sample. The lowest Yb3+ concentration (~16%) is obtained in the sample annealed for the longest time (No. 11). The susceptibility of the majority phase in this sample may be estimated by the following procedure. The measured susceptibility is fit to the form \chi = C/(T + \Theta) + \chi_{0} by a least-squares method from 300 to 4.2 K; we assume that the Curie-Weiss term C/(T + \Theta) is due to the small amount of second phase and that \chi_{0} is the temperature-independent susceptibility of the majority phase. A good fit to such an expression is obtained (standard deviation +-0.3%) making the above assumptions plausible. By this procedure we estimate that the susceptibility of the majority phase is weakly paramagnetic, \chi_{0} = 0.25 \times 10^{- 6} emu/g.

## IV LaPd_{2}Ge_{2} AND LaPt_{2}Ge_{2}

Superconductivity results for these two phases are shown in Table II. No extra diffraction lines were present in the annealed sample of LaPd_{2}Ge_{2}, although the metallographic studies revealed the presence of a needlelike precipitate. Basically, the sample was single phase. The as-prepared sample differed little from the annealed and it was essentially  single phase. The diffractometer trace of the annealed sample of LaPt_{2}Ge_{2} showed several weak extra lines that could be indexed on the basis of La_{2}O_{3}, Ge, and LaGe_{2}. The structure of LaPt_{2}Ge_{2} is tetragonal, but a variant of the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure.[4]

The magnetic susceptibility of LaPd_{2}Ge_{2} exhibited a small Curie contribution that is attributed to a low level of paramagnetic impurities (perhaps 20-50 ppm Fe). Otherwise the intrinsic susceptibility is temperature independent and 0.1 x 10^{-6} emu/g.

LaPt_{2}Ge_{2} exhibits a weakly temperature dependent diamagnetic susceptibility below 300 K. A small Curie-Weiss contribution was observed below 50 K probably caused by a small amount of Fe impurity (20 ppm). The absolute value \chi_{g} for this sample at room temperature is -0.02\times 10^{-6} emu/g \pm20%.

The susceptibilities of LaPt_{2}Ge_{2} and of LaPd_{2}Ge_{2} are typical of low density states metals and are slightly smaller than the estimated susceptibility of YbPd_{2}Ge_{2}.

The superconducting transitions as measured by a low-frequency (25 Hz) ac bridge for powdered samples of LaPd_{2}Ge in low applied fields showed a surprising reversibility as demonstrated by the differential paramagnetic signals shown in Fig. 1. This high degree of reversibility for the entry and exit of small amounts of flux is rarely found in intermetallic compounds. The very low critical field curve shown in the inset suggests that the material may in fact be a type 1 superconductor.

## V CeCu_{2}Si_{2}

Steglich _et al._[1] recently reported superconductivity in CeCu_{2}Si_{2} (T_{e} = 0.5 K). This material exhibits low-temperature transport properties suggestive of Ce "unstable 4f shell" behavior. The samples Steglich _et al._ studied were prepared by arc melting and their results were obtained on both unannealed and annealed samples. We have not been able to reproduce their superconductivity results. More specifically, a sample of CeCu_{2}Si_{2} annealed at 900 degC for five days (similar to the Steglich _et al._ annealed sample) was normal down to 0.47 K. The sample reported by Steglich _et al._ became superconducting above 0.5 K. Further measurements in a dilution refrigerator down to 0.060 K by Dynes showed no evidence for bulk superconductivity although a noticeable decrease in resistance occurred. This decrease could be due to a smeared out superconducting transition of a minority second phase.

The diffractometer trace for our sample exhibited very weak extra diffraction peaks that could be indexed on the basis of the presence of Cu_{3}Si, CeCu_{2}, CeCu_{6}, and CuO as extra phases. The magnetic susceptibility exhibited a temperature-dependent paramagnetic contribution that did not fit Curie-Weiss behavior over any significant temperature range. This may be due to the fact that the crystal-field splittings of Ce^{3+} are frequently on the order of 100 K. On the other hand, CeCu_{2} and CeCu_{6}, as impurity phases may be contributing to the above susceptibility behavior. CeCu_{2} has been shown to exhibit a non-Curie-Weiss temperature-dependent susceptibility[5] and it is likely that CeCu_{6} would exhibit similar behavior.

## VI YbCu_{2}Ge_{2}

A sample of YbCu_{2}Ge_{2}, annealed at 670 degC for five days, did not exhibit superconductivity down to 0.47 K.
