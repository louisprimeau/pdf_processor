###### Abstract

Point-contact Andreev-reflection spectroscopy measurements were
performed in SmFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) polycrystallineals with _x_=0.09
(T_(c)=42 K) and _x_=0.20 (T_(c)=52 K). In all cases the experimental
conductance curves reproducibly exhibit low-energy peaks and
higher-energy shoulders (at 4-6 and 16-20 meV, respectively, for
_x_=0.20), which indicate the presence of two nodeless superconducting
gaps. While the single-band Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model can only
reproduce a small central portion of a given conductance curve, the
two-gap one accounts remarkably well for the shape of the whole
experimental _d1_’_d_V_ vs V curve. The fit of the normalized curves
gives Δ₁(0)=6.15 +- 0.45 meV and Δ₂(0)=18 +- 3 meV for _x_=0.20, while
for _x_=0.09 the values Δ₁(0)=4.9 +- 0.5 meV and Δ₂(0)=15 +- 1 meV are
obtained. In all cases, both gaps close at the same temperature and
follow a BCS-like behavior.

The experimental evidence of superconductivity in F-doped LaFeAsO
(Ref. 1) paved the way to the discovery of a new class of
superconductors that, with the exception of copper-based high-T_(c)
superconductors, show the highest critical temperatures known so far,
with the record T_(c)=55 K in F-doped or oxygen-deficient SmFeAsO.[2, 3]

SmFeAsO is semimetallic and shows a spin-density-wave (SDW)
antiferromagnetic order as well as a tetragonal- orthorhombic structural
transition at ∼140 K.[4] Charge doping in the FeAs planes (obtained, for
example, by partial substitution of oxygen with fluorine) rapidly
suppresses the SDW order until superconductivity sets in.[4] The
vicinity of the superconducting state to a magnetic one raises many
questions concerning the pairing mechanism that is responsible for
superconductivity. Local-density approximation calculations for the
LaFeAsOF system[5] (performed by assuming a nonmagnetic ground state)
showed that the electron-phonon coupling is not sufficient to explain
the observed T_(c). An extended _s_+-wave pairing with a sign reversal
of the order parameter between different sheets of the Fermi surface was
thus proposed[6] and shown to be compatible with a coupling mechanism
related to spin fluctuations, as well as with a multigap scenario.[7, 8]
On the experimental side, growing evidence for multigap
superconductivity in Fe-As-based compounds is being provided by several
experimental works.[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]

A general consensus on the pairing mechanism in these new
superconductors, and especially on the number, nature, and symmetry of
the superconducting order parameter(s) is however still to be achieved.
For example, point-contact Andreev-reflection spectroscopy (PCAR) is one
of the most powerful techniques to determine the gap value(s) and its
(their) symmetry, but the results of PCAR studies performed so far in
SmFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) (Refs. 17 and 18) appear in complete disagreement.
Chen _et al.[18]_ observed a single BCS-like _s_-wave gap, while Wang
_et al.[17]_ reported two nodal order parameters.

In this Rapid Communication, we report the results of PCAR measurements
in state-of-the-art polycrystalline samples of SmFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x). The
experimental data for _x_=0.20 reproducibility show the presence of two
nodeless energy gaps, Δ₁(0)=6.15 +- 0.45 meV and Δ₂(0)=18 +- 3 meV, both
approximately showing a BCS-like temperature dependence and closing at
the same temperature T_(c)^(A), which is the critical temperature of the
junction. In all the point contacts we made on SmFeAsO_(0.8)F_(0.2),
T_(c)^(A) is always close to the bulk T_(c). In samples with _x_=0.09 a
reduction of 25

The polycrystalline samples of SmFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) were synthesized
under high pressure starting from SmAs, FeAs, SmF₃, Fe₂O₃, and Fe. After
the materials were pulverized and sealed in a BN crucible, a pressure of
30 kbar was applied at room temperature. The temperature was then
increased up to 1350−1450 degC in 1 h, kept for 4.5 h at this value, and
then fast decreased down to room temperature. Finally the pressure was
released.[19] The resulting samples are very compact and made up of
shiny crystallites whose size, as revealed by scanning electron
microscopy images, is on the order of 30 μm. The bulk critical
temperature, defined here at the onset of the superconducting transition
measured by dc magnetization, is T_(c)=52 K for _x_=0.20 (inset to
Fig. 1) and T_(c)=42 K for _x_=0.09.

The point contacts were made by putting a small drop (⊘50 μm) of Ag
conducting paste on the fresh surface of the sample instead of pressing
a metallic tip against it as in the standard PCAR technique. This
pressureless technique was already successfully used in MgB₂, CaC₆,
ruthenocurates, A15, and so on.[20, 21] The contacts made in this way
are likely to be the parallel of some nanojunctions established between
the Ag grains (2−10 μm in size) and the SmFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x)
crystallites (=30 μm) and are very stable under thermal cycling. This
allowed us to easily record the conductance curves up to 200 K.

When performing PCAR experiments, one should check that the contact is
ballistic, i.e., that its radius a is smaller than the electronic mean
free path, ℓ, in the superconductor.[22] In these conditions, injected
charges do not lose energy in the contact region and energy-resolved
spec troscopy is possible. In our case, the occurrence of multiple
contacts and the poor knowledge of ℓ make this check impossible.
However, the absence of heating effects in our junctions can be deduced
from the general shape of the conductance curves, from the amplitude of
the Andreev-reflection features, and from the absence of dips.[25]

The differential conductance dI/dV of our point contacts was obtained by
taking the numerical derivative of the I-V characteristics. Figure 1
shows the raw conductance curves, measured from 4.2 up to about 165 K of
a contact on SmFeAsO_(0.8)F_(0.2) whose normal-state resistance is 40 Ω.
The critical temperature of the junction (T_(c)^(A)=51 ± 1 K) is reached
when the conductance at zero bias decreases abruptly (due to the
collapse of the gaps) _and_ the subsequent curves, although equally
spaced in temperature, look almost superimposed to one another. The
lowest-temperature curve (top thick line) shows clear Andreev-reflection
features such as two peaks at about ±4 mV, certainly related to a
superconducting gap,[18] plus two broad shoulders at higher bias that,
as in MgB₂,[20] can indicate a second larger gap. In all our contacts on
this sample the normal-state conductance measured at $T_{c}^{\rm t}$
(middle thick line in Fig. 1) features a hump at zero bias that
gradually decreases upon heating until it completely disappears (bottom
thick line) around the Neel temperature of the parent compound,
T_(N)∼140 K.[4] This might suggest a magnetic origin of this hump even
though this point deserves further investigation. A similar downward
curvature of the normal-state spectrum was also found in recent PCAR
(Ref. [11]) and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy[10]
measurements in Ba_(0.6)K_(0.4)Fe₂As₂. Finally, the conductance is
always asymmetric for positive/negative bias at all temperatures, even
above T_(c)^(A) and even when the zero-bias hump disappears. This
asymmetry was also observed in other PCAR measurements.[11, 12, 18]

In view of a comparison with a theoretical model, the experimental
conductance curves (dI/dV vs V) of each junction had to be normalized,
i.e., divided by the relevant normal-state conductance. Since the upper
critical field is very high,[24] the normal-state conductance at
T<$T_{c}^{\rm t}$ is not experimentally accessible. The normalization
was therefore performed by using the normal-state conductance curve
measured at $T_{c}^{\rm s}$.

Figure 2 shows several examples of low-temperature normalized
conductance curves (symbols) obtained in an optimally doped sample
(x=0.20). In most cases, the amplitude of the Andreev signal is on the
order of 20−30

The normalized conductance curves were then fitted with a s-wave
two-band BTK model[28] generalized to include broadening effects[29] and
the angular dependence of the charge injection probability.[26] In this
model,[30] the normalized conductance is the weighted sum of the
conductances of the two bands, G=w₁G₁^(BTK)+(1 - w₁)G₂^(BTK) where w₁ is
the weight of band 1. Each conductance depends on three pa

peaks and two shoulders (arrows). The curve at $T_{c}^{\rm t}$ (middle

rameters: the gap Δ, a broadening parameter Γ,[29] and the effective
potential barrier parameter Z.[26, 28] The model contains seven fitting
parameters (three for each band plus w₁), which are not totally free in
the sense that, if one fits the whole temperature dependence of a
conductance curve, Z₁ and Z₂, the weight w₁ and the broadening
parameters Γ₁ and Γ₂ should remain approximately constant.

In Fig. 2, the normalized experimental curves are compared to the
relevant two-gap fitting curves (solid lines) and to the single-gap ones
(dash lines). Clearly, the single-gap model can only account for a small
portion of the spectra (as in Ref. [18]). The relevant gap values range
from 7.0 to 8.9 meV, corresponding to
$2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}^{\rm{d}}$=3.1−3.9. The two-gap fit can instead
reproduce the experimental curves remarkably better and gives Δ₁=6.1−6.6
meV and Δ₂=16−21 meV. Thanks to the amplitude of the Andreev signal, the
ratio Γ_(i)(0)/Δ_(i)(0) is usually ∼0.4−0.6 or smaller; w₁ is
0.55 ± 0.10 depending on the junction. The normalized conductances often
show a residual right/left asymmetry, which mainly affects the
determination of Δ₂; this asymmetry might be due to the unconventional
shape of the background, which is itself asymmetric and changes with
temperature. A fit of the positive- and negative-bias sides of the
normalized curves was carried out to evaluate the uncertainty on Δ₂
arising from this asymmetry.

An example of how the two-band model can fit the normalized conductance
curves recorded at different temperatures is given in Fig. 3. Here, the
experimental curves (symbols) are slightly offset for clarity and
compared to the BTK curves (lines) that best fit their negative-bias
side. The parameters Z₁ and Z₂ used for the fit are indicated in the
labels of the right inset; a small decrease (on the order of 20

The temperature dependence of the gaps in SmFeAsO_(0.8)F_(0.2) obtained
from the two-gap BTK fit of the curves shown in Fig. 3 and of various
other curves is reported in Fig. 4. The reproducibility of the small gap
(open symbols) is noticeable: Δ₁ is close to 6 meV at low temperature
and follows a BCS-like trend up to $T_{c}^{\rm{d}}$, which is always
between 50 and 53 K in our contacts (the normalized temperature
$T/T_{c}^{\rm{d}}$ is used in Fig. 4 for homogeneity). As far as Δ₂ is
concerned, its behavior _in each set of data_ is compatible with a
BCS-like trend, but the spread of values between different data sets is
rather wide: all the data fall in a region

bounded by two BCS-like curves with gap ratios
$2\Delta_{2}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}^{\rm d}\!=\!7$ and 9, respectively.
Incidentally, this region is centered on a value Δ₂ = 18 meV that is
close to that determined with infrared ellipsometry.[31] The spread of
Δ₂ values shown in Fig. 4 is not an artifact due to our particular PCAR
technique since in MgB₂, for example, both the gaps were determined in
the same way with great accuracy (±0.5 meV at most, at 4.2 K).

At low temperature, the ratio of the gaps Δ₂/Δ₁ is about 3, as also
observed in other pnictides.[11, 12, 13, 14] Such a high value can be
obtained within the Eliashberg theory provided that the simplest
interband-only s ±-wave model[6] is extended to the case of three energy
bands with a strong interband coupling between two of them and a small
boson frequency.[32]

Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of the normalized conductance
curves (symbols) and the relevant two-gap fits (lines) for an underdoped
SmFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) sample with x = 0.09. As in the previous cases, the
raw conductance curves were divided by the normal-state conductance
measured at $T_{c}^{\rm d}$. Unlike in the x = 0.20 samples, this curve
did not show the "hump" at zero bias but a smooth positive curvature
superimposed to the usual right/left asymmetry. This shape did not
change significantly upon increasing the temperature up to 180 K.
Looking at our experimental data on various samples, we found indeed
that the percentage of contacts with zero-bias hump in the normal-state
conductance decreases upon decreasing the doping content. Whenever the
hump is present $T_{c}^{\rm d}$, it disappears around 140 K so that the
conductance curves flatten (as in Fig. 1); otherwise, the shape of the
conductance curves changes much less on heating. This interesting
behavior deserves further investigation and will be the subject of a
forthcoming paper.

In Fig. 5 the left and right insets show the temperature dependence of
the gaps and of the Γ parameters obtained from the fit of the
negative-bias side of the conductance curves. In strong analogy with the
results obtained in optimally doped samples, the shape of the
experimental curves and the goodness of the two-band BTK fit strongly
suggest the presence of two gaps Δ₁(0) = 4.9 ± 0.5 meV and Δ₂(0) =15± 1
meV, reduced by about 20

In summary, we performed pressureless PCAR measurements in
SmFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) polycrystals with x = 0.20 and 0.09. The
experimental low-temperature conductance curves show peaks at low bias
and shoulders at higher voltage, which can be interpreted as being due
to two nodeless superconducting gaps. Indeed, the two-gap BTK model
accounts remarkably well for the whole shape of the normalized curves,
apart from their asymmetry. Upon increasing the temperature, the two
gaps approximately follow a BCS-like temperature dependence and close at
the same temperature, $T_{c}^{\rm d}$. In optimally doped samples
(x = 0.20) the reproducibility of the small gap Δ₁ over different
contacts is rather good, while the spread of Δ₂ is very large, possibly
because of the uncertainty in the normalization and the asymmetry of the
PCAR spectra. On average, we obtained Δ₁(0) = 6.15 ± 0.45 meV and Δ₂(0)
=18± 3 meV with ratios $2\Delta_{1}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}^{\rm d}\!=\!2.5\!-\!3$
and $2\Delta_{2}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}^{\rm d}\!=\!7\!-\!9$, respectively. These
results are basically confirmed in underdoped samples (x = 0.09) with
$T_{c}^{\rm d}\!=\!39$ K, where we obtained Δ₁(0) = 4.9 ± 0.5 meV and
Δ₂(0) =15± 1 meV and similar high gap ratios that, as recently shown,
_can_ be reproduced theoretically.[32] All these results, together with
other experimental findings in pnictide superconductors,[9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16, 17] point toward a common multigap scenario to most (if
not all) Fe-As-based superconductors.
