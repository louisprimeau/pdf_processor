###### Abstract

Magnetization M(T, H) measurements performed on thoroughly characterized
commercial amorphous carbon powder doped with sulfur (AC-S), revealed
the occurrence of an inhomogeneous superconductivity (SC) below
$T_{\rm c}$=38 K. The constructed magnetic field-temperature (H-T) phase
diagram resembles that of type-II superconductors. However, AC-S
demonstrates a number of anomalies, such as: (1) a nonmonotonic behavior
of the lower critical-field $H_{\rm c1}(T)$; (2) a pronounced positive
curvature of the apparent upper critical-field boundary $H_{\rm c2}(T)$;
and (3) a spontaneous ferromagneticlike magnetization M₀ coexisting with
SC. Based on the analysis of experimental results we propose a
nonstandard SC state in AC-S.

Recently, possible superconductivity (SC) in graphene (isolated
graphitic layer) attracted considerable theoretical attention.[1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] In many respects, this was motivated by the
current interest of graphene itself,[11, 12, 13] and by observations of
SC at elevated temperatures in related materials: doped fullerenes[14,
15] graphite,[16, 17, 18, 19] diamond,[20, 21] and carbon nanotubes.[22,
23] In particular, BCS type SC in graphene with a mean-field critical
temperature $T_{\rm c}^{\rm MF}$ up to ∼150 K was calculated in Refs.
[5] and [7], and $T_{\rm c}^{\rm MF}$ well above the room temperature
was predicted within the framework of the resonating valence bond (RVB)
model,[1, 8] proposed by Anderson[24] for high-$T_{\rm c}$ cuprates.
From the experimental side, localized SC found for graphite-sulfur (G-S)
composites[16, 17, 18, 15] is perhaps the most suggestive realization of
the theoretical expectations for the doping-induced SC in graphene.[2,
2, 4, 8] Both d-wave[1, 8] and p-wave[25, 26, 1, 2] symmetries of the SC
order parameter (OP) were predicted for graphene. The occurrence of
p-wave SC in G-S is appealing, because it coexists with the
ferromagnetism (FM),[27] and the interaction between SC and FM OPs has
been experimentally demonstrated.[17] According to Ref. [25], the
high-$T_{\rm c}$p-wave SC emerges in a matrix of curved graphene layers
with inserted pentagons and heptagons. If high-$T_{\rm c}$p-wave SC
exists in graphitic materials, this may have far-reaching consequences,
due to the non-Abelian statistics of the vortices in p-wave SC, allowing
for the quantum computation.[28] Hence, the research in this direction
has a broad and an interdisciplinary interest. Amorphous carbon (AC) is
a strongly disordered material consisting of a submicron curved graphene
layers with a mixed interlayer stacking. AC also contains partially
graphitized carbon fragments that possess both negative and positive
curvatures, required for SC.[29] All these motivations triggered the
present work.

This report is focused on experimental evidences for SC in sulfur-doped
amorphous carbon (AC-S) occurring at T<$T_{\rm c}$=38 K. The observed
anomalous behavior of the lower and the apparent upper critical fields,
as well as the coexistence of superconducting and ferromagneticlike
states, all suggest an unconventional superconducting state in AC-S.

The pristine material is a 74-year-old commercial amorphous carbon
powder manufactured by Fisher (C190-N) as decolorized carbon. The AC-S
sample was obtained by mixing AC and sulfur (99.998

The samples were thoroughly characterized by means of x-ray diffraction
(XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) JOEL JSM-7700 SEM, and ⁵⁷Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy.
Trace element analysis was performed by means of the inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS) (Perkin-Elmer ICP-OES model 3300) of
acid extracts. M(T, H) measurements up to H=50 kOe and 5≤T≤300 K were
performed by using commercial (MPMS5 Quantum Design) superconducting
quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. Zero-field-cooled
(ZFC) magnetization $M_{\rm ZFC}(T,H)$ plots were measured via heating
the samples after cooling at H=0. Prior to each ZFC measurement, the
SQUID magnetometer was adjusted to compensate the remnant magnetic field
of the SC solenoid. The field-cooled data $M_{\rm FCC}(T,H)$ were taken
under cooling in applied field.

The featureless XRD patterns obtained for both AC and AC-S samples are
consistent with their amorphouslike structure. From SEM images, we found
a broad distribution in the carbon "grain" size which ranges from ∼10 nm
to several microns. Spatially resolved elemental composition analysis on
AC performed by EDS yields: Na [0.30(1) at.

Figure 1 shows $M_{\rm ZFC}(T,H)$ and $M_{\rm FCC}(T,H)$ curves measured
for the pristine AC sample at H = 22 Oe. Figure 2(a) presents
$M_{\rm ZFC}(T,H)$ and $M_{\rm FCC}(T,H)$ of AC-S, measured at H = 50 Oe
up to 275 K. The low-temperature range of Fig. 2(a) as well as the
remnant magnetization $M_{\rm REM}$ (T, H = 0), recorded after the FCC
process when the field was switched off at T = 5 K, are exhibited in
Fig. 2(b). Here, the irrelevant temperature-independent background
magnetization M_(m) = 0.037 emu/g measured for this sample was
subtracted from all three branches. As Fig. 2(b) demonstrates, below
$T_{\rm c}$ ∼ 38 K, the magnetization is strongly irreversible and
$M_{\rm FCC}(T)$ > $M_{\rm ZFC}(T)$. Both $M_{\rm ZFC}(T)$ and
$M_{\rm REM}(T)$ show a pronounced steplike feature at $T_{\rm c}$ ∼ 38
K. Importantly, $M_{\rm FCC}(T)$ also demonstrates a clear drop (though,
smaller in amplitude) below $T_{\rm c}$. It appears, that below
$T_{\rm c}$$M_{\rm ZFC}(T)$ is negative (diamagnetic), as expected for
SC, where the diamagnetism originates from screening supercurrents, and
the drop of $M_{\rm FCC}(T)$ is associated with the magnetic-flux
expulsion due to Meissner effect (ME). Then, it is reasonable to relate
$M_{\rm REM}(T)$ to the trapped magnetic flux (vortices). The estimated
shielding fraction deduced from $M_{\rm ZFC}(T)$ and the Meissner
fraction (MF) are ∼0.15

Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the normalized ZFC magnetization
$M_{\rm ZFC}(T)/M_{\rm ZFC}(40$ K) measured for various fields. As Fig.
3(b) exemplifies, $T_{\rm c}(H)$ at lower fields can be well

defined. For H = 25 kOe Fig. 3(a), the SC-like transition is suppressed
(masked) and the (reversible) magnetization demonstrates a paramagnetic
(PM) behavior. The phase boundary _T_c(_H_) = _H__c_2(_T_) deduced from
Fig. 3, which presumably separates the SC and normal states, is shown in
Fig. 4(a). The PM at high applied fields limited the available for
analysis experimental points to t = _T_/_T_c = 0.8. The obtained data
points can be best fitted by the power law

H_(c2)(T) = H_(c2)(0)(1 − T/T_(c))^(α),

where a = 2.4 +- 0.2, _H_c2(0) = 6.5 * 105 Oe, and _T_c = 38 K.

The low-field portions of various _M_ZFC(_H_) isotherms measured for
AC-S are presented in Fig. 5. For H < _H_c1(_T_), the _M_ZFC(_T_,_H_)
linearly decrease with H, (see the main panel and the upper inset in
Fig. 5) as expected for SC in the Meissner state. _M_ZFC(_H_) = M0 -
_kh_(_T_)_H, where _kh_(_T_) is the absolute value of the diamagnetic
susceptibility, and M0 >= 0 is the spontaneous magnetization whose
values depend on a thermomagnetic sample history (see below). The
estimated shielding fraction extracted from _kh_d is 0.13

Figure 6 sheds light on the origin of M0. The AC-S sample was first
cooled from T = 300 K to T = 5 K at H = 0. Then, _M_ZFC(_T_) at 50 Oe
was measured (step 1). Above _T_C (at T = 40 - 43 K) the field was
switched off and _M_REM was recorded (step 2). Next, the sample was
cooled down to 5 K, and M0 was measured (step 3). After that, a higher
field was applied and the same procedure was repeated. The
_M_ZFC(_T_,_H_) curves obtained at various fields are depicted in Figs.
6(a)-6(c). As can be seen, _M_REM(_T_ > _T_c) = M0(_T_ = 5 K). It also
appears that _M_REM (_M_0)  _H_’ with m = 0.4. The occurrence of _M_REM,
and its increase with the field are characteristic features of FM. As
stated above, it is reasonable to relate M0 with the FM state associated
with the carbon matrix. However, Fig. 2(a) does not reveal any signature
for a FM transition in the entire temperature interval up to 275 K. On
the contrary, for T < _T_max * 150 K, both _M_ZFC(_T_) and _M_FCC(_T_)
decrease with the temperature decreasing. Such magnetic behavior is
consistent with the occurrence of antiferromagnetic correlations
competing with the FM order. In addition, M0 = 0.24 emu/g obtained from
_M_(_H_) at T = 5 K (Fig. 5, lower inset) agrees well with M0(_H_)  
H0.4 dependence, indicating that M0(_M_REM) mainly originates from the
FM state and not from trapped SC vortices. Heating the sample to room
temperature totally suppresses _M_REM.

Whereas it is too premature to speculate on the anomalous behavior of
the apparent upper and lower critical fields, as well as on the origin
of carbon-related magnetism, a brief comment should be instructive. In
conventional SC, near _T_c,

(solid line) with M0 = 0.04 emu/g, _H_c1 = 200 Oe, and c = 10−3. The
dotted straight line is _M_ZFC(_H_) = - _kh_s_B. |_kh_|= 3.4 × 10−5

T = 5 K up to H = 50 kOe.
