###### Abstract

Magnetization M(T,H) measurements performed on thoroughly characterized commercial amorphous carbon powder doped with sulfur (AC-S), revealed the occurrence of an inhomogeneous superconductivity (SC) below T_{\rm c}=38 K. The constructed magnetic field-temperature (H-T) phase diagram resembles that of type-II superconductors. However, AC-S demonstrates a number of anomalies, such as: (1) a nonmonotonic behavior of the lower critical-field H_{\rm c1}(T); (2) a pronounced positive curvature of the apparent upper critical-field boundary H_{\rm c2}(T); and (3) a spontaneous ferromagneticlike magnetization M_{0} coexisting with SC. Based on the analysis of experimental results we propose a nonstandard SC state in AC-S.

Recently, possible superconductivity (SC) in graphene (isolated graphitic layer) attracted considerable theoretical attention.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] In many respects, this was motivated by the current interest of graphene itself,[11, 12, 13] and by observations of SC at elevated temperatures in related materials: doped fullerenes[14, 15] graphite,[16, 17, 18, 19] diamond,[20, 21] and carbon nanotubes.[22, 23] In particular, BCS type SC in graphene with a mean-field critical temperature T_{\rm c}^{\rm MF} up to \sim150 K was calculated in Refs. [5] and [7], and T_{\rm c}^{\rm MF} well above the room temperature was predicted within the framework of the resonating valence bond (RVB) model,[1, 8] proposed by Anderson[24] for high-T_{\rm c} cuprates. From the experimental side, localized SC found for graphite-sulfur (G-S) composites[16, 17, 18, 15] is perhaps the most suggestive realization of the theoretical expectations for the doping-induced SC in graphene.[2, 2, 4, 8] Both d-wave[1, 8] and p-wave[25, 26, 1, 2] symmetries of the SC order parameter (OP) were predicted for graphene. The occurrence of p-wave SC in G-S is appealing, because it coexists with the ferromagnetism (FM),[27] and the interaction between SC and FM OPs has been experimentally demonstrated.[17] According to Ref. [25], the high-T_{\rm c}p-wave SC emerges in a matrix of curved graphene layers with inserted pentagons and heptagons. If high-T_{\rm c}p-wave SC exists in graphitic materials, this may have far-reaching consequences, due to the non-Abelian statistics of the vortices in p-wave SC, allowing for the quantum computation.[28] Hence, the research in this direction has a broad and an interdisciplinary interest. Amorphous carbon (AC) is a strongly disordered material consisting of a submicron curved graphene layers with a mixed interlayer stacking. AC also contains partially graphitized carbon fragments that possess both negative and positive curvatures, required for SC.[29] All these motivations triggered the present work.

This report is focused on experimental evidences for SC in sulfur-doped amorphous carbon (AC-S) occurring at T<T_{\rm c}=38 K. The observed anomalous behavior of the lower and the apparent upper critical fields, as well as the coexistence of superconducting and ferromagneticlike states, all suggest an unconventional superconducting state in AC-S.

The pristine material is a 74-year-old commercial amorphous carbon powder manufactured by Fisher (C190-N) as decolorized carbon. The AC-S sample was obtained by mixing AC and sulfur (99.998%; Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.) powders in a mass ratio m_{\rm C}:m_{\rm S}=2\cdot1. The mixed powder was pressed and sealed in evacuated quartz tube and then heated at 250 ^{\circ}C for 24 h before cooling down to ambient temperature.

The samples were thoroughly characterized by means of x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) JOEL JSM-7700 SEM, and ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy. Trace element analysis was performed by means of the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS) (Perkin-Elmer ICP-OES model 3300) of acid extracts. M(T,H) measurements up to H=50 kOe and 5\leqT\leq300 K were performed by using commercial (MPMS5 Quantum Design) superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. Zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization M_{\rm ZFC}(T,H) plots were measured via heating the samples after cooling at H=0. Prior to each ZFC measurement, the SQUID magnetometer was adjusted to compensate the remnant magnetic field of the SC solenoid. The field-cooled data M_{\rm FCC}(T,H) were taken under cooling in applied field.

The featureless XRD patterns obtained for both AC and AC-S samples are consistent with their amorphouslike structure. From SEM images, we found a broad distribution in the carbon "grain" size which ranges from \sim10 nm to several microns. Spatially resolved elemental composition analysis on AC performed by EDS yields: Na [0.30(1) at. %], oxygen [2.44(1) at. %], and sulfur [0.21(1) at. %] as extra elements. The same analysis performed on AC-S sample showed: Na (0.35 at. %), oxygen (1.96 at. %), and sulfur (10.3 at. %). The mass ratio m_{\rm C}:m_{\rm S} are 174 and 3 for AC and AC-S samples, respectively. Thus, the major difference between the AC and AC-S samples is the significant increase in the sulfur contents in AC-S. The trace element analysis of AC revealed impurities (ppm): V (2.05), Ni (2.77), Zn (7.09), Cu (11.1), Mn(133.1), Al (212.7), Fe (360.0), and Na (4625). It means that the total amount of magnetic impurities (Ni, Mn, and Fe) is about 486 ppm. Long-time (two weeks) room-temperature ^{57}Fe Mossbauer measurements, performed on AC sample, revealed a broad magnetic spectrum with two sextets, with an estimated Fe concentration of \sim350 \pm50 ppm. A least-squares fit provides evidence that the magnetic sextets are related to magnetite (Fe_{3}O_{4}). From  M(H) measurements of AC, we deduced a spontaneous FM magnetization of M_{m} = 0.033 emu/g. This value corresponds to 350 ppm of Fe_{3}O_{4} (M_{\rm S} = 94.5  emu/g) and is in a perfect agreement with that obtained from Mossbauer measurements.

Figure 1 shows M_{\rm ZFC}(T,H) and M_{\rm FCC}(T,H) curves measured for the pristine AC sample at H = 22 Oe. Figure 2(a) presents M_{\rm ZFC}(T,H) and M_{\rm FCC}(T,H) of AC-S, measured at H = 50 Oe up to 275 K. The low-temperature range of Fig. 2(a) as well as the remnant magnetization M_{\rm REM} (T,H = 0), recorded after the FCC process when the field was switched off at T = 5 K, are exhibited in Fig. 2(b). Here, the irrelevant temperature-independent background magnetization M_{m} = 0.037 emu/g measured for this sample was subtracted from all three branches. As Fig. 2(b) demonstrates, below T_{\rm c} \sim 38 K, the magnetization is strongly irreversible and M_{\rm FCC}(T) > M_{\rm ZFC}(T). Both M_{\rm ZFC}(T) and M_{\rm REM}(T) show a pronounced steplike feature at T_{\rm c} \sim 38 K. Importantly, M_{\rm FCC}(T) also demonstrates a clear drop (though, smaller in amplitude) below T_{\rm c}. It appears, that below T_{\rm c}M_{\rm ZFC}(T) is negative (diamagnetic), as expected for SC, where the diamagnetism originates from screening supercurrents, and the drop of M_{\rm FCC}(T) is associated with the magnetic-flux expulsion due to Meissner effect (ME). Then, it is reasonable to relate M_{\rm REM}(T) to the trapped magnetic flux (vortices). The estimated shielding fraction deduced from M_{\rm ZFC}(T) and the Meissner fraction (MF) are \sim0.15% and \sim0.02%, respectively. Since no corrections for carbon magnetism (see below) and for the flux trapping effects were made, the ME provides only the lower limit for the SC volume fraction. Nevertheless, the smallness of both shielding and MF values suggests an inhomogeneous SC state in AC-S. The data presented in Fig. 1 suggest also a possible SC state with T_{\rm c} = 32 K in AC with a shielding fraction of \sim0.03%, a value which is five times smaller than that obtained for AC-S. The much smaller shielding fraction in AC would explain the invisibility of the Meissner signal in M_{\rm FCC}(T) in Fig. 1. Since the AC and AC-S samples differ only in their sulfur contents, it is reasonable to assume that the SC state observed for AC (Fig. 1) is triggered by sulfur. Adding sulfur to AC (Fig. 2), both T_{\rm c} and the SC fraction are enhanced.

Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the normalized ZFC magnetization M_{\rm ZFC}(T)/M_{\rm ZFC}(40 K) measured for various fields. As Fig. 3(b) exemplifies, T_{\rm c}(H) at lower fields can be well

  defined. For H = 25 kOe Fig. 3(a), the SC-like transition is suppressed (masked) and the (reversible) magnetization demonstrates a paramagnetic (PM) behavior. The phase boundary _T_c(_H_) = _H__c_2(_T_) deduced from Fig. 3, which presumably separates the SC and normal states, is shown in Fig. 4(a). The PM at high applied fields limited the available for analysis experimental points to t = _T_/_T_c = 0.8. The obtained data points can be best fitted by the power law

\[H_{\text{c2}}(T) = H_{\text{c2}}(0)(1 - T/T_{\text{c}})^{\alpha},\]

where a = 2.4 +- 0.2, _H_c2(0) = 6.5 * 105 Oe, and _T_c = 38 K.

The low-field portions of various _M_ZFC(_H_) isotherms measured for AC-S are presented in Fig. 5. For H < _H_c1(_T_), the _M_ZFC(_T_,_H_) linearly decrease with H, (see the main panel and the upper inset in Fig. 5) as expected for SC in the Meissner state. _M_ZFC(_H_) = M0 - _kh_(_T_)_H, where _kh_(_T_) is the absolute value of the diamagnetic susceptibility, and M0 >= 0 is the spontaneous magnetization whose values depend on a thermomagnetic sample history (see below). The estimated shielding fraction extracted from _kh_d is 0.13%. Noting, that M0 does not alter _kh_(_T_). Unexpectedly, |_kh_(5 K)| is smaller than that measured at T = 10 - 25 K. It should be also emphasized that the M0 (_H_ = 0, T = 5 K) * 0.24 emu/g is ~7 times bigger than _M_m * 0.037 emu/g attributed to Fe3O4, i.e., the M0 is essentially related to the AC-S matrix. _M_ZFC(_H_) deviates from the linearity for H >= _H_c1(_T_). The _H_c1(_T_) is plotted in Fig. 4(b), where the straight line is obtained from the equation _H_c1(_T_) = _H_c1(0)(1 - _T_/_T_c) with _H_c1(0) = 550 Oe. Note, the anomalous drop of _H_c1 at T = 5 K. The lower inset in Fig. 5 presents the _M_ZFC(_H_) hysteresis loop measured at T = 5 K up to H = 50 kOe. The PM behavior is evident from the reversible nonsaturating high-field portion of the _M_(_H_), giving the PM susceptibility _kh_P = 10-5 emu/g Oe, that fits well to the known _kh_P values for disordered carbon materials (see, e.g., Ref. [30]).

Figure 6 sheds light on the origin of M0. The AC-S sample was first cooled from T = 300 K to T = 5 K at H = 0. Then, _M_ZFC(_T_) at 50 Oe was measured (step 1). Above _T_C (at T = 40 - 43 K) the field was switched off and _M_REM was recorded (step 2). Next, the sample was cooled down to 5 K, and M0 was measured (step 3). After that, a higher field was applied and the same procedure was repeated. The _M_ZFC(_T_,_H_) curves obtained at various fields are depicted in Figs. 6(a)-6(c). As can be seen, _M_REM(_T_ > _T_c) = M0(_T_ = 5 K). It also appears that _M_REM (_M_0) ~_H_' with m = 0.4. The occurrence of _M_REM, and its increase with the field are characteristic features of FM. As stated above, it is reasonable to relate M0 with the FM state associated with the carbon matrix. However, Fig. 2(a) does not reveal any signature for a FM transition in the entire temperature interval up to 275 K. On the contrary, for T < _T_max * 150 K, both _M_ZFC(_T_) and _M_FCC(_T_) decrease with the temperature decreasing. Such magnetic behavior is consistent with the occurrence of antiferromagnetic correlations competing with the FM order. In addition, M0 = 0.24 emu/g obtained from _M_(_H_) at T = 5 K (Fig. 5, lower inset) agrees well with M0(_H_) ~ H0.4 dependence, indicating that M0(_M_REM) mainly originates from the FM state and not from trapped SC vortices. Heating the sample to room temperature totally suppresses _M_REM.

Whereas it is too premature to speculate on the anomalous behavior of the apparent upper and lower critical fields, as well as on the origin of carbon-related magnetism, a brief comment should be instructive. In conventional SC, near _T_c,

The dotted straight line is _M_ZFC(_H_) = - _kh_s_B. |_kh_|= 3.4 × 10−5 emu/g Oe. The lower inset shows _M_ZFC(_H_) hysteresis loop measured at T = 5 K up to H = 50 kOe.

Importantly, M_{\rm FCC}(T) also demonstrates a clear drop (though, smaller in amplitude) below T_{\rm c}. It appears, that below T_{\rm c}M_{\rm ZFC}(T) is negative (diamagnetic), as expected for SC, where the diamagnetism originates from screening supercurrents, and the drop of M_{\rm FCC}(T) is associated with the magnetic-flux expulsion due to Meissner effect (ME). Then, it is reasonable to relate M_{\rm REM}(T) to the trapped magnetic flux (vortices). The estimated shielding fraction deduced from M_{\rm ZFC}(T) and the Meissner fraction (MF) are \sim0.15% and \sim0.02%, respectively. Since no corrections for carbon magnetism (see below) and for the flux trapping effects were made, the ME provides only the lower limit for the SC volume fraction. Nevertheless, the smallness of both shielding and MF values suggests an inhomogeneous SC state in AC-S. The data presented in Fig. 1 suggest also a possible SC state with T_{\rm c} = 32 K in AC with a shielding fraction of \sim0.03%, a value which is five times smaller than that obtained for AC-S. The much smaller shielding fraction in AC would explain the invisibility of the Meissner signal in M_{\rm FCC}(T) in Fig. 1. Since the AC and AC-S samples differ only in their sulfur contents, it is reasonable to assume that the SC state observed for AC (Fig. 1) is triggered by sulfur. Adding sulfur to AC (Fig. 2), both T_{\rm c} and the SC fraction are enhanced.

Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the normalized ZFC magnetization M_{\rm ZFC}(T)/M_{\rm ZFC}(40 K) measured for various fields. As Fig. 3(b) exemplifies, T_{\rm c}(H) at lower fields can be well

  defined. For H = 25 kOe Fig. 3(a), the SC-like transition is suppressed (masked) and the (reversible) magnetization demonstrates a paramagnetic (PM) behavior. The phase boundary _T_c(_H_) = _H__c_2(_T_) deduced from Fig. 3, which presumably separates the SC and normal states, is shown in Fig. 4(a). The PM at high applied fields limited the available for analysis experimental points to t = _T_/_T_c = 0.8. The obtained data points can be best fitted by the power law

\[H_{\text{c2}}(T) = H_{\text{c2}}(0)(1 - T/T_{\text{c}})^{\alpha},\]

where a = 2.4 +- 0.2, _H_c2(0) = 6.5 * 105 Oe, and _T_c = 38 K.

The low-field portions of various _M_ZFC(_H_) isotherms measured for AC-S are presented in Fig. 5. For H < _H_c1(_T_), the _M_ZFC(_T_,_H_) linearly decrease with H, (see the main panel and the upper inset in Fig. 5) as expected for SC in the Meissner state. _M_ZFC(_H_) = M0 - _kh_(_T_)_H, where _kh_(_T_) is the absolute value of the diamagnetic susceptibility, and M0 >= 0 is the spontaneous magnetization whose values depend on a thermomagnetic sample history (see below). The estimated shielding fraction extracted from _kh_d is 0.13%. Noting, that M0 does not alter _kh_(_T_). Unexpectedly, |_kh_(5 K)| is smaller than that measured at T = 10 - 25 K. It should be also emphasized that the M0 (_H_ = 0, T = 5 K) * 0.24 emu/g is ~7 times bigger than _M_m * 0.037 emu/g attributed to Fe3O4, i.e., the M0 is essentially related to the AC-S matrix. _M_ZFC(_H_) deviates from the linearity for H >= _H_c1(_T_). The _H_c1(_T_) is plotted in Fig. 4(b), where the straight line is obtained from the equation _H_c1(_T_) = _H_c1(0)(1 - _T_/_T_c) with _H_c1(0) = 550 Oe. Note, the anomalous drop of _H_c1 at T = 5 K. The lower inset in Fig. 5 presents the _M_ZFC(_H_) hysteresis loop measured at T = 5 K up to H = 50 kOe. The PM behavior is evident from the reversible nonsaturating high-field portion of the _M_(_H_), giving the PM susceptibility _kh_P = 10-5 emu/g Oe, that fits well to the known _kh_P values for disordered carbon materials (see, e.g., Ref. [30]).

Figure 6 sheds light on the origin of M0. The AC-S sample was first cooled from T = 300 K to T = 5 K at H = 0. Then, _M_ZFC(_T_) at 50 Oe was measured (step 1). Above _T_C (at T = 40 - 43 K) the field was switched off and _M_REM was recorded (step 2). Next, the sample was cooled down to 5 K, and M0 was measured (step 3). After that, a higher field was applied and the same procedure was repeated. The _M_ZFC(_T_,_H_) curves obtained at various fields are depicted in Figs. 6(a)-6(c). As can be seen, _M_REM(_T_ > _T_c) = M0(_T_ = 5 K). It also appears that _M_REM (_M_0) ~_H_' with m = 0.4. The occurrence of _M_REM, and its increase with the field are characteristic features of FM. As stated above, it is reasonable to relate M0 with the FM state associated with the carbon matrix. However, Fig. 2(a) does not reveal any signature for a FM transition in the entire temperature interval up to 275 K. On the contrary, for T < _T_max * 150 K, both _M_ZFC(_T_) and _M_FCC(_T_) decrease with the temperature decreasing. Such magnetic behavior is consistent with the occurrence of antiferromagnetic correlations competing with the FM order. In addition, M0 = 0.24 emu/g obtained from _M_(_H_) at T = 5 K (Fig. 5, lower inset) agrees well with M0(_H_) ~ H0.4 dependence, indicating that M0(_M_REM) mainly originates from the FM state and not from trapped SC vortices. Heating the sample to room temperature totally suppresses _M_REM.

Whereas it is too premature to speculate on the anomalous behavior of the apparent upper and lower critical fields, as well as on the origin of carbon-related magnetism, a brief comment should be instructive. In conventional SC, near _T_c,

The double-logarithmic plot of _H_c2(_T_) vs 1 - _T_/_T_c is presented in the inset. (b) Lower critical-field _H_c1(_T_) obtained as indicated in Fig. 5 (upper inset); the straight line is the linear fit: _H_c1(_T_) = _H_c1(0) (1 - _T_/_T_c) with _H_c1(0) = 550 Oe and _T_c = 38 K.

The upper inset exemplifies the validity of Eq. (2) that fits _M_ZFC(_H_) for T = 5 K (solid line) with M0 = 0.04 emu/g, _H_c1 = 200 Oe, and c = 10−3. The dotted straight line is _M_ZFC(_H_) = - _kh_s_B. |_kh_|= 3.4 × 10−5 emu/g Oe. The lower inset shows _M_ZFC(_H_) hysteresis loop measured at T = 5 K up to H = 50 kOe.
