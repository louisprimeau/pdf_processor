###### Abstract

We have successfully grown high-quality single crystals of SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) and \(A_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\)(\(A\) = Sr, Ba) using flux method. The resistivity, specific heat, and Hall coefficient have been measured. For parent compound SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), an anisotropic resistivity with \(\rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\) as large as 130 is obtained at low temperatures. A sharp drop in both in-plane and out-plane resistivities due to the spin-density-wave (SDW) instability is observed below 200 K. The angular dependence of in-plane magnetoresistance shows twofold symmetry with field rotating within \(ab\) plane below SDW transition temperature. This is consistent with a stripe-type spin ordering in SDW state. In K-doped \(A_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\)(\(A\) = Sr, Ba), the SDW instability is suppressed and the superconductivity appears with \(T_{c}\) above 35 K. The rather low anisotropy in upper critical field between \(H\|ab\) and \(H\|c\) indicates that interplane coupling plays an important role in hole-doped Fe-based superconductors.

The recent discovery of superconductivity with transition temperature \(T_{c}\) \(\sim\) 26 K in LaFeAsO\({}_{1\rightarrow\text{Sr}}\)\({}_{x}\) has generated tremendous interest in scientific community.[1] Shortly after this discovery, the \(T_{c}\) was raised to 41-55 K by replacing La by rare-earth Ce, Sm, Pr, Nd, etc., making those systems with \(T_{c}\) exceeding 50 K.[2, 3, 4, 5] The undoped quaternary compounds crystallize in a tetragonal ZrCuSiAs-type structure, which consists of alternate stacking of edge-sharing Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) tetrahedral layers and La\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\) tetrahedral layers along \(c\) axis. Very recently, superconductivity with \(T_{c}\) of up to 38 K was discovered in \(A\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\)(\(A\) = Ba, Sr, Ca) upon K or Na doping.[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\(A\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) compounds crystallize in a tetragonal ThCr\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\)-type structure with identical Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) tetrahedral layers as in LaFeAsO, but separated by single elemental \(A\) layers. These compounds contain no oxygen in \(A\) layers. The simpler structure of \(A\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) system makes it more suitable for research of intrinsic physical properties of Fe-based compounds.

Except for a relatively high transition temperature, the system displays many interesting properties. The existence of a spin-density-wave (SDW) instability in parent LaFeAsO (Ref. [11]) was indicated by specific heat, optical measurements, and first-principles calculations, and subsequently confirmed by neutron-scattering,[12] NMR,[13]\(\mu\)sR,[14] and Mossbauer[15] spectroscopic measurements. The superconductivity only appears when SDW instability was suppressed by doping carriers or applying pressure. The competition between superconductivity and SDW instability was identified in other rare-earth substituted systems.[2, 16, 17] Besides the SDW instability, structural distortions from tetragonal to monoclinic were also observed for both ReFeAsO (Re = rare earth) and \(A\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (\(A\) = Ba, Sr, Ca).[18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23] The structural transition temperatures were found to occur at slightly higher than SDW transition temperature in LaFeAsO,[12] but the two transitions occur simultaneously in \(A\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (\(A\) = Ba, Sr, Ca).[18, 19, 24] The band-structure calculation and neutron-scattering experiments indicated a stripe-type antiferromagnetic structure of Fe moments in SDW state in LaFeAsO.[11, 12] In such a spin structure, a fourfold spin rotation symmetry is broken and reduced to twofold. It is interesting to see if such a twofold symmetry could be observed in angular-dependent magnetoresistance (MR) measurements.

In this work, we present resistivity, specific-heat, and Hall-coefficient measurements on single crystals of SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) and \(A_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (\(A\) = Sr, Ba). A large anisotropic resistivity with \(\rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\) \(\sim\) 130 is observed for SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\). Below 200 K, a sharp drop in both in-plane and out-plane resistivities due to the SDW instability is observed, similar to previous results on polycrystal samples.[7] Moreover, the angular dependence of in-plane and out-plane magnetoresistances shows twofold symmetry with field rotating within \(ab\) plane below SDW transition temperature. The breaking of fourfold rotation symmetry to twofold provides transport evidence for the formation of a stripe-type antiferromagnetic structure of Fe moments in SDW state. Moreover, the anisotropy of upper critical field for high-quality single crystals of Sr\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) is investigated. The interlayer coupling is relatively strong in superconducting samples.

The parent single crystals of SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) were prepared by the high-temperature solution method using Sn as flux, similar to the procedure described in Ref. [21]. The superconducting crystals \(A_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (\(A\) = Sr, Ba) were prepared by the high-temperature solution method using FeAs as flux. The starting materials of Sr or Ba, K, and FeAs in a ratio of 0.5:1:4 were put into an alumina crucible and sealed in welded Ta crucible under 1.6 atm of argon. The Ta crucible was then sealed in an evacuated quartz ampoule and heated at 1150 \({}^{\circ}\) C for 5 h and cooled slowly to 800 \({}^{\circ}\)C over 50 h. The platelike crystals with sizes up to 10 mm\(\times\) 5 mm \(\times\) 0.5 mm could be obtained after breaking the alumina crucible. Both scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray (SEM/EDX) and induction-coupled plasma (ICP) analyses revealed that the elemental composition of the crystal is \(A_{0.6\pm}\delta\)K\({}_{0.4\pm}\delta\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (\(A\) = Sr, Ba) with \(\delta\) \(\cong\) 0.02. Figure 1(a) shows x-ray-diffraction pattern of parent SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) with the 00\(\ell\) reflections. The lattice constant \(c\) = 0.1239 nm was calculated from the higher-order peaks, comparable to that of polycrystalline sample.[2] Figure 1(b) shows the EDX analysis of Ba\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) crystal.

The in-plane resistivity was measured by the standard  four-probe method. The out-plane resistivity was measured using a typical method for layered materials as shown in inset of Fig. 2(b). The silver paste was used to cover almost all area of upper and lower sides of the measured sample for two current leads, and leaves two small holes in the center of both sides for the voltage leads. Assuming that the current density is uniformly distributed throughout the cross section, the resistivity can then be measured with \(\rho_{c} = RS/d\), where \(R\) is the resistance, \(S\) is area of cross section, and \(d\) is the thickness of the sample. The error comes mostly from the measurement of geometry factors. The ac magnetic susceptibility was measured with a modulation field in the amplitude of 10 Oe and a frequency of 333 Hz. The Hall-coefficient measurement was done using a five-probe technique. The specific-heat measurement was carried out using a thermal relaxation calorimeter. All these measurements were performed down to 1.8 K in a physical property measurement system (PPMS) of Quantum Design company.

Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of in-plane resistivity \(\rho_{ab}\) in zero field and 8 T, and Fig. 2(b) shows the out-plane resistivity \(\rho_{c}\) for SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) in zero field. They have similar \(T\)-dependent behavior and exhibit a strong anomaly at about 200 K: the resistivity drops steeply below this temperature. This is a characteristic feature related to SDW instability and a structural distortion in parent compounds of Fe-based high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors.[11, 12] The transition temperature is slightly lower than that observed in polycrystalline SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (\(\sim\)205 K). The anisotropic resistivity \(\rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\) is found to be \(\sim\)130 \(\pm\) 65 at 25 K. It is comparable with that of layered cuprates YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\theta}\)[25] From Fig. 2(a), we find that the SDW transition temperature is insensitive to the applied field; however a large positive magnetoresistance is observed at low temperatures. At 10 K, the magnetoresistance [\(\rho_{ab}(8\,\)T\()-\rho_{ab}(0\,\)T\()\)]/\(\rho_{ab}(0\,\)T\()\) reaches as high as 25%. The behavior is similar to that observed in polycrystal LaFeAsO.[11] The large positive magnetoresistance can be understood from the suppression of SDW order by applied field, and thus, the spin scattering is enhanced.

In a system with strong coupling of charge carrier and background magnetism, angular-dependent magnetoresistance (AMR) is a useful tool to detect the magnetic structure of background magnetism. AMR measurements have been successfully used in understanding the spin structure of slightly doped high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates and charge ordering Na\({}_{0.5}\)CoO\({}_{2}\) systems.[26, 27] For this purpose, we measured the in-plane resistivity with magnetic field of 10 T rotating within the \(ab\) plane for SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\). Figure 3 shows AMR [\(\Delta\rho(\theta)\) = \(\rho(\theta)\) - \(\rho(90^{\circ})\)] at 10, 30, 50, 100, 150, and 200 K. \(\Delta\rho(\theta)\) shows a clear twofold oscillation below 200 K. However, the twofold oscillation disappears at 200 K, a tempera

  ture just above \(T_{\rm SDW}\). Above \(T_{\rm SDW}\), the spin orientations of Fe moments are random so there is no angular-dependent magnetoresistance arising from spin scattering. However below \(T_{\rm SDW}\), a large MR is observed at low temperature and it originates from the enhanced spin scattering while SDW order is suppressed in external magnetic field. Therefore the symmetry of the AMR oscillation reflects directly the symmetry of spin structure. The observation of twofold-symmetry oscillations in SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) in low temperatures indicates the stripe-type spin structure of Fe moments in ground state. The recent neutron-diffraction measurements on SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) single crystals [24] and polycrystalline [28] indicate that the SDW transition is indeed presented in SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) system below a transition temperature of \(\sim\)200\(-\)220 K. The stripe-type antiferromagnetic spin structure is found in the SDW state. Moreover, the angular-dependent magnetization measurement on BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) crystal with field rotating within the \(ab\) plane also shows a twofold symmetry of magnetization below SDW transition temperature, [29] consistent with the AMR measurements on SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) crystals. Therefore AMR can act as a probe for SDW order in these systems without having to wait for neutron beam time. Similar twofold-symmetry oscillations of AMR have been observed in Na\({}_{0.5}\)CoO\({}_{2}\), which was attributed to ordering of charge stripes. [27]

To get more information about the SDW and structural phase transition, we performed specific-heat and Hall resistivity measurements for SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\). Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependence of specific heat \(C\) from 2 to 230 K. We can see clearly a sharp \(\delta\)-function shape peak at about 200 K with \(\Delta C\)\(\sim\) 185 J/mol K. This is a characteristic feature of a first-order phase transition. The transition temperature agrees well with that observed in resistivity measurement. The latent heat of the transition is estimated as being 463 \(\pm\) 50 J/mol by integrating the area of the specific-heat data around the transition peak after subtracting the background. The background is estimated using a linear fit of the specific-heat data above and below the transition. It is worth noting that only one peak at around 200 K is observed in SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), different from that of LaFeAsO where two subsequent peaks at 155 and 143 K were observed in specific-heat data, corresponding to structural and SDW transitions, respectively. [30] This suggests the structural transition and SDW transition occur at the same temperature in SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), similar to that observed in BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\). [18; 19] At low temperatures, a good linear \(T^{2}\) dependence of \(C/T\) is observed which indicates that the specific heat \(C\) is mainly contributed by electrons and phonons [see inset of Fig. 4(a)]. The fit yields the electronic coefficient \(\gamma\)=6.5 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) and the Debye temperature \(\theta_{D}\)=245 K. Note that the electronic coefficient is significantly smaller than the values obtained from the band-structure calculations for nonmagnetic state. [31] This can be explained that a partial energy gap is opened below SDW transition; the smaller experimental value here could be naturally accounted for by the gap formation which removes parts of the density of states below the phase transition. Compared with band calculation, similar smaller electronic specific-heat coefficient was also observed in LaOFeAs due to gap opening originated from SDW instability. [11] In comparison, we also measured specific heat of superconducting crystal Sr\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) prepared using FeAs as flux. It is found that no structural and SDW transitions can be observed in specific-heat data. Instead, a specific-heat anomaly at a superconducting transition temperature with \(T_{c}\)\(\sim\) 35.6 K is observed. The specific-heat jump \(\Delta C/T_{c}\) is found to be \(\sim\)48 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\).

  Hall coefficient \(R_{H}\) as a function of temperature between 20 and 300 K for SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) is shown in Fig. 5. For comparison, \(R_{H}(T)\) for LaFeAsO is also shown in inset of Fig. 5. Above 200 K, the Hall coefficient is negative and nearly temperature independent for SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), indicating that conduction carriers are dominated by electrons. The carrier density is estimated as being \(n\) = 1.5 \(\times\) 10\({}^{22}\) cm\({}^{-3}\) at 300 K if one-band model is simply adopted. It is nearly an order higher than that of LaFeAsO with \(n\sim 1.8\times 10^{21}\) cm\({}^{-3}\) at 300 K obtained by same method. Optical measurement also indicates a quite large plasma frequency, \(\omega_{p}\) \(\sim\) 1.5 eV.[32] The large carrier number for SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) indicates that it is a good metal. Below 200 K, the Hall coefficient increases slightly to a positive value, and then drops dramatically to a very large negative value. The absolute value of \(R_{H}\) at 2 K is about 35 times larger than that at 300 K. The dramatic change reflects the reconstruction of Fermi surface after SDW transition. The band calculations show that there are three hole pockets around \(\Gamma\) point and two electron pockets around \(M\) point.[11] The experiments seem to indicate that upon cooling below the SDW transition temperature, hole pockets are almost fully gapped while the electron pockets are partially gapped. Therefore, at low temperatures, the \(R_{H}\) reflect mainly the ungapped electron density around point \(M\), which is significantly small in comparison with its initial value above 200 K.

In addition to parent SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), the anisotropy of resistivity and upper critical field for single crystals of \(A_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (\(A\)=Sr, Ba) is also investigated. Figure 6(a) shows the temperature dependence of the in-plane resistivity in zero field for Sr\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) and Ba\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) crystals. \(\rho_{ab}\) decreases with decreasing temperature and shows a downward curvature for Sr\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), consistent with the polycrystal sample. With further decreasing temperature, an extremely sharp superconducting transition at 35.5 K with transition width of about 0.3 K is observed, indicating high homogeneity of the sample. A sharp superconducting transition for Ba\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) is also observed with \(T_{c}\)=38 K, slightly higher than that of Sr\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\). The anisotropic resistivity \(\rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\) in normal state for Sr\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) is found

  to be 21, much lower than that of parent SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\).

Figures 6(b) and 6(c) show \(\rho_{ab}(T)\) for Sr\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) in external magnetic fields of up to 14 T along \(c\) axis and within \(ab\) plane, respectively. We can see that the superconducting transition is broadened slightly in magnetic fields of up to 14 T. The behavior is different from polycrystalline LaFeAsO where the superconducting transition is broadened strongly in magnetic fields.[33] Figure 6(d) shows \(H_{c2}\)-\(T_{c}\) curves for both \(H\)\(\parallel\)\(ab\) and \(H\)\(\parallel\)\(c\), respectively, where \(T_{c}\) is adopted by a criterion of 90% of normal-state resistivity. The curves \(H_{c2}(T)\) are very steep with slopes \(-dH_{c2}^{ab}/dT\)\(\mid_{T_{c}}\) = 7.57 T/K for \(H\)\(\parallel\)\(ab\) and \(-dH_{c2}^{ab}/dT\)\(\mid_{T_{c}}\) = 3.80 T/K for \(H\)\(\parallel\)\(c\). This indicates that the upper critical fields are extremely high for Sr\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\). Using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg formula[34]\(H_{c2}(0)\) = \(-\)0.69(\(dH_{c2}/dt)T_{c}\) and taking \(T_{c}\)=35.5 K, the upper critical fields are \(H_{c2}^{ab}\)=185.4 T and \(H_{c2}^{c}\)=93.1 T. The anisotropy ratio \(\gamma\)=\(H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^{c}\)\(\approx\) 2.0[20]. The value of \(\gamma\) is close to that of Ba\({}_{0.55}\)K\({}_{0.45}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) with \(\gamma\) between 2.5 and 3.5. It is lower than that of F-doped NdFeAsO (Ref. [35]) with \(\gamma\)\({}^{m}\)\(\approx\) 4.3\(-\)4.9, and much lower than high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates; for example, \(\gamma\)\({}^{m}\)\(\approx\) 7\(-\)10 for YBCO.[36] The lower values of \(\rho_{c}\)/\(\rho_{ab}\) and \(\gamma\) indicate that the interplane coupling in Sr\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) is relatively strong.

To summarize, SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) and \(A_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\)(\(A\)=Sr, Ba) single crystals were prepared by flux method. The angular dependence of in-plane resistivity was measured for SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\). A twofold symmetry of oscillations in AMR is observed at low temperatures which possibly indicates a stripe-type spin structure below SDW temperature. In K-doped \(A_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (\(A\)=Sr, Ba), the SDW instability is suppressed and instead superconductivity appears with \(T_{c}\) above 35 K. The upper critical field is rather high with \(H_{c2}^{ab}\) = 185.4 T, while its anisotropy is rather low. The interplane coupling may play an important role in this material.
