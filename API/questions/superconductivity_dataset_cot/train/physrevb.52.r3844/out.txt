###### Abstract

Temperature-dependent static magnetization, ac magnetic susceptibility, and electrical-resistivity measurements of single-crystal DyNi2B2C reveal bulk superconductivity below T_{c} = (6.2 +- 0.1) K. This T_{c} is well below the Neel temperature T_{N} = 10.3 K. DyNi2B2C is the first RNi2B2C compound with T_{c} < T_{N}. The upper critical magnetic field H_{c2}(T) increases approximately linearly from zero at 6.2 K to \sim 5 kG at 2 K.

The interplay between superconductivity and local-moment magnetism has been vigorously studied since the late 1950s.[1] In the 1970s the discovery of two families of magnetic superconductors, RMo_{6}(S,Se)_{8} and RRh_{4}B_{4} (R = rare earth), led to a detailed study of the interaction between the magnetic sublattice and the superconducting electrons.[1] Recently the RNi2B2C family of magnetic superconductors was discovered.[2] For R = Lu, Y, Tm, Er, and Ho the superconducting transition temperatures for single-crystal samples are T_{c} = 16.0, 15.0, 10.8, 10.5, and 8.5 K, respectively.[3, 4, 5, 6, 7] Superconductivity coexists with antiferromagnetic (AF) order for R = Tm, Er, and Ho for temperatures below the Neel temperatures T_{N} = 1.5, 5.85, and 6.0 K, respectively.[4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10] Similar values of T_{c} and T_{N} have been found for polycrystalline samples.[28] In virtually all known magnetic superconductors,[11] when there is a coexistence of AF ordering and superconductivity, T_{c} > T_{N}. The only local-moment systems that have T_{c} < T_{N} are solid solutions such as the R(Ir_{x}Rh_{1-x})4B_{4} system where T_{N} = 2.7 K and T_{c} = 1.4 K for R = Ho and x = 0.7.[1, 12] This reversal of T_{c} and T_{N} only occurs for 0.6 < x < 0.8 in this alloy. Compounds exhibiting T_{c} < T_{N} are expected to be rare since the stronger the conduction electron-local moment coupling (such as would be required for a higher T_{N}), the greater the anticipated suppression of T_{c} through magnetic pair breaking.[1] In this paper we report the discovery of superconductivity in single-crystal DyNi2B2C below a T_{c} = (6.2 +- 0.1) K that is well below the T_{N} = 10.3 K. This is the first such member of the RNi2B2C family with T_{c} < T_{N}.

Single crystals of DyNi2B2C were grown from Ni2B flux[3] using high-purity elements: B (99.9%), Ni (99.99%), C (99.99%), and Ames Lab Dy (99.99%). The crystals grow in the form of plates with the crystallographic c axis perpendicular to the largest plate surface. The static magnetization M was measured using a Quantum Design (SQUID) magnetometer and the ac susceptibility \chi_{\rm ac} was measured using a Lakeshore ac magnetometer. The single crystal used for the M and \chi_{\rm ac} measurements had approximate dimensions of 2.5 \times 2.5 \times 0.7 mm^{3}. The four-lead electrical resistivity \rho_{ab} was measured on a platelike crystal with the current flowing in the basal ab plane using a Linear Research, LR 400, ac resistance bridge operating at 15.9 Hz.

Figure 1 shows the powder x-ray-diffraction pattern of a crushed single crystal of DyNi2B2C. The diffraction peaks index well to the tetragonal unit cell reported[2] for DyNi2B2C with lattice parameters a = 3.534 A and c = 10.484 A. The only peak that is not indexed to DyNi2B2C is the weak peak at 2 \theta = 45.85deg, attributed to the [21] peak of the Ni2B flux.[13]

Figure 2 displays the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility \chi(T) of DyNi2B2C with a magnetic field H = 1 KG applied parallel (**H**|**c) and perpendicular (**HL** \varpropto) to the c axis. Magnetic neutron diffraction measurements[14] indicate that the sharp feature at T_{N} = 10.3 K in Fig. 2 should be attributed to the onset of AF order. The large anisotropy seen between **H**|**c and **HL** c at low T is a feature common to the RNi2B2C materials for R = Er, Ho, and Tb.[6, 7, 15] The inset to Fig. 2 shows \chi^{-1}(T) for both directions of applied field as well as for the polycrystalline average of the \chi_{\rm lc} and \chi_{\rm lc} data: \chi_{\rm poly} = \chi_{\rm lc}/3 + 2\chi_{\rm lc}/3. The \chi_{\rm poly}(T) data can be fitted by a Curie-Weiss law \chi = C/(T = \theta) for 20 < T < 350 K, giving an effective moment \mu_{\rm eff} = 9.85 \mu_{B} and \theta = (1 \pm 2) K. This value of \mu_{\rm eff} is slightly lower than the theoretical value of 10.63 \mu_{B} for the J = 15/2 Hund's rule ground state of Dy3+. The anisotropic \chi(T) data can also be fitted by a Curie-Weiss form for **H**|**_c_ for 230 K < T < 375 K giving \mu_{\rm eff} = 10.4 \mu_{B} and \theta = - 82 K and for **HL** c for 200 K < T < 325 K giving \mu_{\rm eff} = 9.8 \mu_{B} and \theta = 25 K.

Figure 3(a) shows \rho_{ab}(T) of a DyNi2B2C crystal. There is a sharp loss of scattering associated with the AF transition at

 T_{N}= 10.3 K, followed by a superconducting transition with an onset at 6.4 K and zero resistivity at 6.0 K. We find \rho_{ab}(300 K) = 55 \mu\Omega cm. The residual resistivity ratio is \rho_{ab}(300 K)/\rho_{ab}(7 K) = 27 indicating that the crystal has a high degree of perfection. Figure 3(b) shows \rho_{ab}(H,T) for \rm{B}<T<T<T and \rm{H}\perpc. For these applied fields (H\leq5 kG), T_{N} is only weakly field dependent, decreasing to T_{N}= 10.0 K for H= 5 kG (not shown). As can be seen from Fig. 3(b), T_{c} is suppressed and the width of the superconducting transition is increased with increasing H.

Figure 4 shows the temperature-dependent upper critical magnetic field H_{c2}(T) derived from the \rho_{ab}(H,T) data in Fig. 3(b). H_{c2}(T) increases nearly linearly with decreasing T from 10 G [just below T_{c}(H= 0)] to \sim 5 kG near 2 K. No local minimum or other structure is seen in H_{c2}(T), which is consistent with T_{c}<T_{N}. This is in contrast to the local extrema in H_{c2}(T) seen for TmNi_{2}B_{2}C,[5, 6] ErNi_{2}B_{2}C,[6, 8] and HoNi_{2}B_{2}C.[7] The value of \|dH_{c2}/dT\|_{T_{c}} = (1.2\pm 0.2) kG/K in less than the values of (2.8\pm 0.2) and (2.6\pm 0.2) kG/K for TmNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [5]) and ErNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [6]), respectively.

Figure 5(a) shows the low-temperature static volume magnetization M of DyNi_{2}B_{2}C for \rm{H}\parallelc. From Fig. 2, for this field direction there is only a weak paramagnetic contribution from the Dy sublattice. In Fig. 5(a), the onset of a superconducting magnetization is seen at 6.1 K which becomes nearly independent of T below 4 K. At 2 K the flux expulsion magnetization is 10% of the ideal value of H/4\,\pi and the shielding fraction is almost 300%. If the crystal is fully superconducting, the latter value indicates a demagnetization factor of 0.66, consistent with that calculated (0.68) for an ellipsoid of revolution with the sample dimensions.

To further confirm that the superconductivity in DyNi_{2}B_{2}C is a bulk rather than a surface effect, the M(T) of a powder sample made by crushing a single crystal of DyNi_{2}B_{2}C was measured [Fig. 5(b)]. T_{N} is now seen at \approx 10.2 K. In addition, a clear onset of a superconducting transition is seen at 5.9 K (see inset). Due to the contribution from the paramagnetic Dy sublattice, the measured magnetization does not become diamagnetic until somewhat lower temperatures. At 2 K the diamagnetic M/H for the field-cooled measurement is 60% of 1/4 \pi and the zero-field-cooled shielding fraction is 140% which is close to the value (150%) anticipated from the powder average demagnetization factor. The polycrystalline data in Fig. 5(b) and the single-crystal data in Fig. 5(a) show a markedly different temperature dependence of the diamagnetism. For the polycrystalline sample there is an onset of superconductivity at 5.9 K followed by a shallow increase of the diamagnetic magnetization on cooling to 4 K, below which there is a rapid increase of diamagnetism. For the single-crystal sample there is a much more uniform and rapid increase of diamagnetism on cooling below 6.1 K which is nearly complete by 4 K.

The circles, squares, and triangles show H_{c2}(T) data determined from Fig. 3(b) by using the zero-resistivity, midpoint, and resistive onset, respectively, as the criterion for determining T_{c}(H).

Figure 3: Electrical resistivity of DyNi_{2}B_{2}C in the ab plane vs temperature T: (a) H= 0 and T<15 K and (b) \rm{H}\perpc and T<7 K.

  Figure 5(c) shows the ac susceptibility \chi_{\rm ac} for {\bf H_{\rm ac}}\|c taken on the same single-crystal sample that was used to provide the data shown in Fig. 5(a). The real part of \chi_{\rm ac} shows a clear onset of diamagnetism below 6.3 K. In addition, below 6.3 K there is an increase in the imaginary part. Both of these features are consistent with a bulk T_{c} of 6.3 K.

Figures 2-5 clearly indicate the existence of a bulk antiferromagnetic transition at T_{N}= 10.3 K and a bulk superconducting transition at T_{c}= (6.2\pm 0.1) K in single-crystal DyNi_{2}B_{2}C. The latter result is in conflict with an earlier report [8] on a polycrystalline sample of DyNi_{2}B_{2}C that showed no superconductivity above 2 K. One possible explanation for this difference is that there may be some residual strain in polycrystalline samples leading to an extrinsic suppression of T_{c} . As shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), a broadening and suppression of the majority of the superconducting transition occurred in our powdered single-crystal sample. Another conspicuous difference between the polycrystalline and single-crystal samples is the value of the residual resistivity \rho_{0} at T>T_{c} : for our single-crystal sample \rho_{0}(7 K) =2.2 \mu\Omega cm (Fig. 3), while for the polycrystalline sample [8]\rho_{0}(7 K)>20 \mu\Omega cm. This difference in \rho_{0} may indicate that DyNi_{2}B_{2}C shows a variability in composition and/or in the degree of crystallographic ordering; such variabilities could strongly affect T_{c} as in A-15 compounds such as Nb_{3}Ge. [16] With T_{c}<T_{N}, the question of whether the T_{c} of DyNi_{2}B_{2}C follows de Gennes scaling is a salient one. Figure 6 shows the T_{N} and T_{c} values for single crystals of RNi_{2}B_{2}C (R = Gd-Tb, Lu, and Y) [3, 7, 10, 11, 15, 17] vs the de Gennes factor (g_{J}-1)^{2}J(J+1), where g_{J} is the Lande factor and J is the total angular momentum of the R^{3+} Hund's rule ground state. Good overall de Gennes scaling is seen for the whole heavy rare-earth series for both T_{c} and T_{N} . This indicates that both T_{N} and the suppression of T_{c} originate from the same conduction electron-local moment exchange interaction. In particular, our T_{c} value for single-crystal DyNi_{2}B_{2}C is on the order of that expected from the variation of T_{c} vs de Gennes factor for the other superconducting members.

In summary, temperature-dependent electrical resistivity, static magnetization, and ac susceptibility measurements have revealed the onset of bulk superconductivity in single-crystal DyNi_{2}B_{2}C at T_{c}= (6.2\pm 0.1) K, which is significantly lower than the antiferromagnetic ordering (Neel) temperature at T_{N}= 10.3 K. DyNi_{2}B_{2}C is the first member of the RNi_{2}B_{2}C series to exhibit T_{c}<T_{N} and also appears to be a

  crystallographically ordered compound outside of the heavy-fermion family to show this order of transition temperatures. While there is good overall de Gennes scaling of T_{c} and T_{N} across the RNi_{2}B_{2}C series, it is still an open question as to how well de Gennes scaling will work for a series of materials where T_{c} is lowered through T_{N} in a more continuous manner. Since T_{c}\!<\!T_{N} for DyNi_{2}B_{2}C and T_{c}\!>\!T_{N} for (Ho,Er,Tm)Ni_{2}B_{2}C, a study of the crossover of T_{c} and T_{N} in, e.g., (Ho_{1-x}Dy_{x})Ni_{2}B_{2}C solid solutions should be very in tereseting.

###### Abstract

Temperature-dependent static magnetization, ac magnetic susceptibility, and electrical-resistivity measurements of single-crystal DyNi2B2C reveal bulk superconductivity below T_{c} = (6.2 +- 0.1) K. This T_{c} is well below the Neel temperature T_{N} = 10.3 K. DyNi2B2C is the first RNi2B2C compound with T_{c} < T_{N}. The upper critical magnetic field H_{c2}(T) increases approximately linearly from zero at 6.2 K to \sim 5 kG at 2 K.

The interplay between superconductivity and local-moment magnetism has been vigorously studied since the late 1950s.[1] In the 1970s the discovery of two families of magnetic superconductors, RMo_{6}(S,Se)_{8} and RRh_{4}B_{4} (R = rare earth), led to a detailed study of the interaction between the magnetic sublattice and the superconducting electrons.[1] Recently the RNi2B2C family of magnetic superconductors was discovered.[2] For R = Lu, Y, Tm, Er, and Ho the superconducting transition temperatures for single-crystal samples are T_{c} = 16.0, 15.0, 10.8, 10.5, and 8.5 K, respectively.[3, 4, 5, 6, 7] Superconductivity coexists with antiferromagnetic (AF) order for R = Tm, Er, and Ho for temperatures below the Neel temperatures T_{N} = 1.5, 5.85, and 6.0 K, respectively.[4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10] Similar values of T_{c} and T_{N} have been found for polycrystalline samples.[28] In virtually all known magnetic superconductors,[11] when there is a coexistence of AF ordering and superconductivity, T_{c} > T_{N}. The only local-moment systems that have T_{c} < T_{N} are solid solutions such as the R(Ir_{x}Rh_{1-x})4B_{4} system where T_{N} = 2.7 K and T_{c} = 1.4 K for R = Ho and x = 0.7.[1, 12] This reversal of T_{c} and T_{N} only occurs for 0.6 < x < 0.8 in this alloy. Compounds exhibiting T_{c} < T_{N} are expected to be rare since the stronger the conduction electron-local moment coupling (such as would be required for a higher T_{N}), the greater the anticipated suppression of T_{c} through magnetic pair breaking.[1] In this paper we report the discovery of superconductivity in single-crystal DyNi2B2C below a T_{c} = (6.2 +- 0.1) K that is well below the T_{N} = 10.3 K. This is the first such member of the RNi2B2C family with T_{c} < T_{N}.

Single crystals of DyNi2B2C were grown from Ni2B flux[3] using high-purity elements: B (99.9%), Ni (99.99%), C (99.99%), and Ames Lab Dy (99.99%). The crystals grow in the form of plates with the crystallographic c axis perpendicular to the largest plate surface. The static magnetization M was measured using a Quantum Design (SQUID) magnetometer and the ac susceptibility \chi_{\rm ac} was measured using a Lakeshore ac magnetometer. The single crystal used for the M and \chi_{\rm ac} measurements had approximate dimensions of 2.5 \times 2.5 \times 0.7 mm^{3}. The four-lead electrical resistivity \rho_{ab} was measured on a platelike crystal with the current flowing in the basal ab plane using a Linear Research, LR 400, ac resistance bridge operating at 15.9 Hz.

Figure 1 shows the powder x-ray-diffraction pattern of a crushed single crystal of DyNi2B2C. The diffraction peaks index well to the tetragonal unit cell reported[2] for DyNi2B2C with lattice parameters a = 3.534 A and c = 10.484 A. The only peak that is not indexed to DyNi2B2C is the weak peak at 2 \theta = 45.85deg, attributed to the [21] peak of the Ni2B flux.[13]

Figure 2 displays the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility \chi(T) of DyNi2B2C with a magnetic field H = 1 KG applied parallel (**H**|**c) and perpendicular (**HL** \varpropto) to the c axis. Magnetic neutron diffraction measurements[14] indicate that the sharp feature at T_{N} = 10.3 K in Fig. 2 should be attributed to the onset of AF order. The large anisotropy seen between **H**|**c and **HL** c at low T is a feature common to the RNi2B2C materials for R = Er, Ho, and Tb.[6, 7, 15] The inset to Fig. 2 shows \chi^{-1}(T) for both directions of applied field as well as for the polycrystalline average of the \chi_{\rm lc} and \chi_{\rm lc} data: \chi_{\rm poly} = \chi_{\rm lc}/3 + 2\chi_{\rm lc}/3. The \chi_{\rm poly}(T) data can be fitted by a Curie-Weiss law \chi = C/(T = \theta) for 20 < T < 350 K, giving an effective moment \mu_{\rm eff} = 9.85 \mu_{B} and \theta = (1 \pm 2) K. This value of \mu_{\rm eff} is slightly lower than the theoretical value of 10.63 \mu_{B} for the J = 15/2 Hund's rule ground state of Dy3+. The anisotropic \chi(T) data can also be fitted by a Curie-Weiss form for **H**|**_c_ for 230 K < T < 375 K giving \mu_{\rm eff} = 10.4 \mu_{B} and \theta = - 82 K and for **HL** c for 200 K < T < 325 K giving \mu_{\rm eff} = 9.8 \mu_{B} and \theta = 25 K.

Figure 3(a) shows \rho_{ab}(T) of a DyNi2B2C crystal. There is a sharp loss of scattering associated with the AF transition at

 T_{N}= 10.3 K, followed by a superconducting transition with an onset at 6.4 K and zero resistivity at 6.0 K. We find \rho_{ab}(300 K) = 55 \mu\Omega cm. The residual resistivity ratio is \rho_{ab}(300 K)/\rho_{ab}(7 K) = 27 indicating that the crystal has a high degree of perfection. Figure 3(b) shows \rho_{ab}(H,T) for \rm{B}<T<T<T and \rm{H}\perpc. For these applied fields (H\leq5 kG), T_{N} is only weakly field dependent, decreasing to T_{N}= 10.0 K for H= 5 kG (not shown). As can be seen from Fig. 3(b), T_{c} is suppressed and the width of the superconducting transition is increased with increasing H.

Figure 4 shows the temperature-dependent upper critical magnetic field H_{c2}(T) derived from the \rho_{ab}(H,T) data in Fig. 3(b). H_{c2}(T) increases nearly linearly with decreasing T from 10 G [just below T_{c}(H= 0)] to \sim 5 kG near 2 K. No local minimum or other structure is seen in H_{c2}(T), which is consistent with T_{c}<T_{N}. This is in contrast to the local extrema in H_{c2}(T) seen for TmNi_{2}B_{2}C,[5, 6] ErNi_{2}B_{2}C,[6, 8] and HoNi_{2}B_{2}C.[7] The value of \|dH_{c2}/dT\|_{T_{c}} = (1.2\pm 0.2) kG/K in less than the values of (2.8\pm 0.2) and (2.6\pm 0.2) kG/K for TmNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [5]) and ErNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [6]), respectively.

Figure 5(a) shows the low-temperature static volume magnetization M of DyNi_{2}B_{2}C for \rm{H}\parallelc. From Fig. 2, for this field direction there is only a weak paramagnetic contribution from the Dy sublattice. In Fig. 5(a), the onset of a superconducting magnetization is seen at 6.1 K which becomes nearly independent of T below 4 K. At 2 K the flux expulsion magnetization is 10% of the ideal value of H/4\,\pi and the shielding fraction is almost 300%. If the crystal is fully superconducting, the latter value indicates a demagnetization factor of 0.66, consistent with that calculated (0.68) for an ellipsoid of revolution with the sample dimensions.

To further confirm that the superconductivity in DyNi_{2}B_{2}C is a bulk rather than a surface effect, the M(T) of a powder sample made by crushing a single crystal of DyNi_{2}B_{2}C was measured [Fig. 5(b)]. T_{N} is now seen at \approx 10.2 K. In addition, a clear onset of a superconducting transition is seen at 5.9 K (see inset). Due to the contribution from the paramagnetic Dy sublattice, the measured magnetization does not become diamagnetic until somewhat lower temperatures. At 2 K the diamagnetic M/H for the field-cooled measurement is 60% of 1/4 \pi and the zero-field-cooled shielding fraction is 140% which is close to the value (150%) anticipated from the powder average demagnetization factor. The polycrystalline data in Fig. 5(b) and the single-crystal data in Fig. 5(a) show a markedly different temperature dependence of the diamagnetism. For the polycrystalline sample there is an onset of superconductivity at 5.9 K followed by a shallow increase of the diamagnetic magnetization on cooling to 4 K, below which there is a rapid increase of diamagnetism. For the single-crystal sample there is a much more uniform and rapid increase of diamagnetism on cooling below 6.1 K which is nearly complete by 4 K.

Figure 4: Upper critical magnetic field H_{c2} vs temperature T for DyNi_{2}B_{2}C with \rm{H}\parallelc. The circles, squares, and triangles show H_{c2}(T) data determined from Fig. 3(b) by using the zero-resistivity, midpoint, and resistive onset, respectively, as the criterion for determining T_{c}(H).

Figure 3: Electrical resistivity of DyNi_{2}B_{2}C in the ab plane vs temperature T: (a) H= 0 and T<15 K and (b) \rm{H}\perpc and T<7 K.

  Figure 5(c) shows the ac susceptibility \chi_{\rm ac} for {\bf H_{\rm ac}}\|c taken on the same single-crystal sample that was used to provide the data shown in Fig. 5(a). The real part of \chi_{\rm ac} shows a clear onset of diamagnetism below 6.3 K. In addition, below 6.3 K there is an increase in the imaginary part. Both of these features are consistent with a bulk T_{c} of 6.3 K.

Figures 2-5 clearly indicate the existence of a bulk antiferromagnetic transition at T_{N}= 10.3 K and a bulk superconducting transition at T_{c}= (6.2\pm 0.1) K in single-crystal DyNi_{2}B_{2}C. The latter result is in conflict with an earlier report [8] on a polycrystalline sample of DyNi_{2}B_{2}C that showed no superconductivity above 2 K. One possible explanation for this difference is that there may be some residual strain in polycrystalline samples leading to an extrinsic suppression of T_{c} . As shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), a broadening and suppression of the majority of the superconducting transition occurred in our powdered single-crystal sample. Another conspicuous difference between the polycrystalline and single-crystal samples is the value of the residual resistivity \rho_{0} at T>T_{c} : for our single-crystal sample \rho_{0}(7 K) =2.2 \mu\Omega cm (Fig. 3), while for the polycrystalline sample [8]\rho_{0}(7 K)>20 \mu\Omega cm. This difference in \rho_{0} may indicate that DyNi_{2}B_{2}C shows a variability in composition and/or in the degree of crystallographic ordering; such variabilities could strongly affect T_{c} as in A-15 compounds such as Nb_{3}Ge. [16] With T_{c}<T_{N}, the question of whether the T_{c} of DyNi_{2}B_{2}C follows de Gennes scaling is a salient one. Figure 6 shows the T_{N} and T_{c} values for single crystals of RNi_{2}B_{2}C (R = Gd-Tb, Lu, and Y) [3, 7, 10, 11, 15, 17] vs the de Gennes factor (g_{J}-1)^{2}J(J+1), where g_{J} is the Lande factor and J is the total angular momentum of the R^{3+} Hund's rule ground state. Good overall de Gennes scaling is seen for the whole heavy rare-earth series for both T_{c} and T_{N} . This indicates that both T_{N} and the suppression of T_{c} originate from the same conduction electron-local moment exchange interaction. In particular, our T_{c} value for single-crystal DyNi_{2}B_{2}C is on the order of that expected from the variation of T_{c} vs de Gennes factor for the other superconducting members.

In summary, temperature-dependent electrical resistivity, static magnetization, and ac susceptibility measurements have revealed the onset of bulk superconductivity in single-crystal DyNi_{2}B_{2}C at T_{c}= (6.2\pm 0.1) K, which is significantly lower than the antiferromagnetic ordering (Neel) temperature at T_{N}= 10.3 K. DyNi_{2}B_{2}C is the first member of the RNi_{2}B_{2}C series to exhibit T_{c}<T_{N} and also appears to be a

  crystallographically ordered compound outside of the heavy-fermion family to show this order of transition temperatures. While there is good overall de Gennes scaling of T_{c} and T_{N} across the RNi_{2}B_{2}C series, it is still an open question as to how well de Gennes scaling will work for a series of materials where T_{c} is lowered through T_{N} in a more continuous manner. Since T_{c}\!<\!T_{N} for DyNi_{2}B_{2}C and T_{c}\!>\!T_{N} for (Ho,Er,Tm)Ni_{2}B_{2}C, a study of the crossover of T_{c} and T_{N} in, e.g., (Ho_{1-x}Dy_{x})Ni_{2}B_{2}C solid solutions should be very in tereseting.
