The same effect is observed with increasing \(x\) at ambient pressure.[12] This change seems to happen when \(T_{\rm N}\) falls below \(\sim\)87 K.

Above \(T_{\rm N}\), \(\rho\) decreases with pressure, at the rate of \(-10\%\)/GPa at 200 K. Below \(T_{\rm N}\), the pressure dependence of \(\rho\) has nearly vanished and \(\rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{n}\), with \(n=2\) for \(x=0.16\), and 0.18, and \(n=1.85\pm 0.05\) for \(x=0.19\) and 0.21, in agreement with \(n=1.90\) at \(x=0.20\) reported previously.[12]\(n\) is independent of pressure and \(A\) decreases only slightly with pressure. The drop in \(\rho(T)\) below \(T_{\rm N}\) is due to the reconstruction of the Fermi surface caused by the antiferromagnetic order, where the loss in carrier density is more than compensated by the reduction in scattering, as in stoichiometric BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\).[12]

For \(P>1\) GPa, a second drop in \(\rho(T)\) is observed at lower temperature. It produces a peak in \(d\rho/dT\) similar to that at \(T_{\rm N}\), revealing the onset of a second Fermi-surface reconstruction, at

Bottom: Temperature derivative of the data in the top panels. The peak (dip) near 100 K signals the onset of antiferromagnetic order at \(T_{\rm N}\). The peak at lower temperature, seen for \(P>1.0\) GPa, signals the onset of a second phase at \(T_{0}\).

  a temperature labeled \(T_{0}\). In Fig. 2, a zoom at low temperature shows that \(T_{0}\) moves up under pressure, in contrast to \(T_{\rm N}\) which moves down.

The superconducting transition moves up with pressure initially, and it becomes sharper where \(T_{c}\) is maximal. At pressures where the new phase is present, \(T_{c}\) moves down with pressure and the transition widens. At \(P>1\) GPa, the onset of the superconducting drop is independent of pressure.

_Phase diagram._ In Fig. 3, the evolution of \(T_{\rm N}\), \(T_{0}\), and \(T_{c}\) with pressure is displayed on a phase diagram for \(x=0.19\). Initially, \(T_{c}\) rises as \(T_{\rm N}\) falls, reflecting the competition between antiferromagnetic and superconducting phases. At low pressure, the pressure-tuned competition mimics the well-known concentration-tuned competition (Fig. 4). \(T_{c}\) reaches a maximal value of \(20.0\pm 0.2\) K at \(P\simeq 1\) GPa, and then it falls. The peak in \(T_{c}\) coincides with the point where the \(T_{0}\) and \(T_{c}\) lines intersect; we label this pressure \(P^{\star}\). (The point \(T_{0}<T_{c}\) at 1.08 GPa was determined by the application of a magnetic field to lower \(T_{c}\); see Fig. 5.)

Qualitatively identical phase diagrams are obtained for all four samples (Fig. 6). With increasing \(x\), the antiferromagnetic phase shrinks, while the new phase expands (to higher temperature and lower pressure). The peak in \(T_{c}(P)\) correlates with the appearance of the new phase, i.e., it coincides with \(P^{\star}\). As shown in Fig. 7(a), \(T_{\rm N}\) decreases with doping the same way at zero pressure and at 2.4 GPa. At 2.4 GPa, \(T_{0}\) increases linearly with doping, so that \(T_{0}\) and \(T_{\rm N}\) are expected to become equal at \(x\simeq 0.23\). The maximum \(T_{c}\) attained under pressure, \(T_{c}^{\rm max}\), increases with \(x\) [Fig. 7(b)]; at high \(x\), it approaches the value of \(T_{c}\) at zero pressure since \(P^{\star}\) moves down with \(x\) [Fig. 7(c)].

_Discussion._ A drop in the resistivity could have a number of possible origins. First, we rule out the possibility of an incomplete superconducting transition by studying the effect of a magnetic field. In Fig. 5, \(\rho(T)\) for \(x=0.19\) is shown at \(H=0\) and 15 T. While \(T_{c}\) shifts down by \(\sim\)7 K, \(T_{0}\) is only suppressed by about 0.7 K. A second possibility is a Lifshitz transition. Within a single antiferromagnetic phase, the Fermi surface can undergo a second reconstruction below the original one at \(T_{\rm N}\) when the spin-density-wave order parameter exceeds a certain critical value. However, such a Lifshitz transition is unlikely to be the explanation here, as \(T_{0}\) and \(T_{\rm N}\) respond in opposite directions to both pressure (Fig. 6) and K concentration (Fig. 7).

Instead, the phenomenology strongly suggests that a second phase transition occurs at \(T_{0}\), to a new phase with currently unknown order. Let us mention two possible density-wave scenarios. The first is a charge-density wave. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data on BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) have revealed highly parallel sections of the Fermi surface inside the antiferromagnetic phase.[16] Such features suggest the possibility of an incommensurate charge-density-wave instability favored by the good nesting conditions, which may be improved by tuning \(x\) and applying pressure.

A second possibility is that \(T_{\rm N}\) and \(T_{0}\) are the onset temperatures of two successive spin-density-wave phases.

The data come from neutron (open diamonds, Ref. [10]) and transport (open squares, Ref. [12]) measurements. The line is a guide to the eye. The small vertical lines indicate the position of \(P^{\star}\). Note that pressure and doping have the same effect in both decreasing \(T_{\rm N}\) and increasing \(T_{c}\), until pressure induces the onset of a new phase at \(P^{\star}\), whereupon \(T_{c}\) drops from its otherwise monotonic increase vs \(P\) and \(x\).

Figure 3: (Color online) Pressure-temperature phase diagram of Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) for \(x=0.19\), showing the antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering temperature \(T_{\rm N}\), the superconducting (SC) transition temperature \(T_{c}\), and the anomaly at \(T_{0}\), as a function of pressure. Error bars are smaller than the size of the symbols. We attribute the anomaly at \(T_{0}\) to the onset of a new phase (NP), whose order has yet to be determined. \(P^{\star}\) is the critical pressure above which the new phase is present.

  The situation is reminiscent of the two successive charge-density-wave transitions in the rare-earth tritellurides \(R\)Te\({}_{3}\),[17] where nesting at a wave vector \({\bf Q}_{1}\) gaps out part of the Fermi surface below the first transition, at \(T_{c1}\), and nesting at a wave vector \({\bf Q}_{2}\), perpendicular to \({\bf Q}_{1}\), further gaps out the Fermi surface below the second transition, at \(T_{c2}<T_{c1}\). By changing the rare-earth ion \(R\) from Dy to Tm, the two transition temperatures go in opposite directions: \(T_{c1}\) drops while \(T_{c2}\) rises.[17] This is interpreted as follows: As the first gap, \(\Delta_{1}\), decreases, more of the Fermi surface remains after reconstruction below \(T_{c1}\) and some of it can take part in the nesting at \({\bf Q}_{2}\), thus producing a stronger gap \(\Delta_{2}\), and hence a larger \(T_{c2}\).[17]

The fact that \(T_{\rm N}\) and \(T_{0}\) go in opposite directions with pressure in Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) suggests a similar picture. The first spin-density wave orders below \(T_{\rm N}\) with \({\bf Q}_{1}=(\pi,0)\) (within a given orthorhombic domain), causing two of the four electron pockets in the Fermi surface to reconstruct. The proposed scenario is that a second spin-density wave orders below \(T_{0}\), with a different wave vector, \({\bf Q}_{2}\). It is conceivable that \({\bf Q}_{2}\simeq(0,\pi)\), causing the other two electron pockets to reconstruct.

  becomes weaker at \(T_{\rm N}\) but stronger at \(T_{0}\). This is consistent with nesting conditions that deteriorate at \(\mathbf{Q}_{1}\) and improve at \(\mathbf{Q}_{2}\) with increasing \(P\) or \(x\). Finally, the new phase appears to compete with superconductivity, as does the antiferromagnetic order. Below \(P^{\star}\), \(T_{c}\) increases while \(T_{\rm N}\) decreases with pressure. Above \(P^{\star}\), as the new phase grows, \(T_{c}\) drops and the dependence of \(T_{c}\) on \(T_{\rm N}\) deviates (Fig. 4).

In summary, we report an anomaly in the temperature dependence of the resistivity of underdoped Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) for \(P>1\) GPa that signals the onset of a Fermi-surface reconstruction at a temperature \(T_{0}\) below the antiferromagnetic temperature \(T_{\rm N}\). We attribute this reconstruction to a new phase that onsets below \(T_{0}\). Whether this phase involves order in the spin, charge, or orbital degree of freedom remains to be determined. However, the overall phenomenology is consistent with a scenario of two related spin-density-wave phases setting in successively at \(T_{\rm N}\) and \(T_{0}\), with wave vectors \(\mathbf{Q}_{1}\simeq(\pi,0)\) and \(\mathbf{Q}_{2}\simeq(0,\pi)\), respectively.
