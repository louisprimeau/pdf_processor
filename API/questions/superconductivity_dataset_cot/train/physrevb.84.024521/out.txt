###### Abstract

Utilizing the high stability of calcium and rare-earth hydrides, CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x} (x = 0.0-1.0) and SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} (x = 0.0-0.47) have been synthesized using high pressure to form hydrogen-substituted 1111-type iron-arsenide superconductors. Neutron diffraction and density functional calculations have demonstrated that the hydrogens are incorporated as H^{-} ions occupying F^{-} sites in the blocking layer of CaFeAsF. The resulting CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x} is nonsuperconducting, whereas, SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} is a superconductor, with an optimal T_{\rm c} = 55 K at x\sim 0.2. It was found that up to 40% of the O^{2-} ions can be replaced by H^{-} ions, with electrons being supplied into the FeAs layer to maintain neutrality (O^{2-} = H^{-} + e^{-}). When x exceeded 0.2, T_{\rm c} was reduced corresponding to an electron overdoped region.

## I Introduction

Since the discovery of superconductivity in LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} (T_{\rm c} = 28 K),^{1} layered iron pnictides and related materials have been intensively investigated as candidates for high-T_{\rm c} superconductors. To date, various types of iron-based superconductors have been synthesized,^{2-}[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] with the highest T_{\rm c} of \sim 55 K being recorded in SmFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1}.^{12-17} The 111-type iron arsenides LnFeAsO (Ln = lanthanide) with a ZrCuSiAs-type structure [18] are composed of stacks of alternating FeAs anti-fluorite-type conducting layers and LnO fluorite-type blocking layers. Although the parent compounds are nonsuperconducting at ambient pressures, they are superconducting when electrons are doped into the FeAs layer via fluorine substitution at the oxygen sites (O^{2-} = F^{-} + e^{-}),^{1,13-17} oxygen vacancy formation (O^{2-} = V_{0} + 2e^{-}),^{19-21} or transition-metal (TM, with excess electrons when compared with Fe, such as Co or Ni) substitution into the iron site.^{22-25} TM substitution, adding electrons to the FeAs layer, is a direct doping mode, whereas, F-substitution or O-vacancy formation is an indirect mode because impurities are doped to the blocking layers and the electrons are transferred to the FeAs layers. The general consensus is that indirect doping gives a higher T_{\rm c} because less structural and electrical disturbances occur in the superconducting layers. However, overdoping via the indirect mode has not been confirmed for most 1111-type iron arsenides. In other words, further improvement in the T_{\rm c} may be possible. For example, the solubility limit of fluorine substitution in LnFeAsO is lower than 20%. This fact is in contrast to alkali-metal substitution in 122-type Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} superconductors in which the Ba site can fully be replaced by K.^{26} This restraint also makes it difficult to complete the electronic phase diagram (doping level vs critical temperatures) beyond the optimal doping level. Completion of the phase diagram is important not only to improve T_{\rm c}, but also to understand superconductivity. Besides, although several papers have reported on the variation of T_{\rm c} with nominal oxygen vacancy or hydrogen content in the 1111 system, the chemical states and the analyzed composition have not been clarified to date.^{19,20,27-29} This ambiguity is an obstacle for understanding the emerging and carrier concentration dependence on T_{\rm c}.

In this paper, we propose a method for indirect electron doping to induce superconductivity in 1111-type iron arsenides. By using a high-pressure synthesis method with an excess hydrogen source, CaFeAsH, an analog of LnFeAsO, and the solid solution between CaFeAsF^{30,31} and CaFeAsH (CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x} where 0\leqslant x\leqslant 1) have been synthesized. While CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x} is nonsuperconducting like LnFeAsO, these results indicate the anion site in the blocking layer can be substituted with H^{-}. Considering the facile formation of metal hydrides with rare earths, H^{-} appears to be stabilized in these rare-earth compounds. Thus, the hydrogen substitution technique has been applied to electron doping in SmFeAsO as with fluorine substitution (O^{2-} = H^{-} + e^{-}). Up to 40% of the oxygen sites were replaced successfully by hydrogen (SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x}, 0<x\leqslant 0.4), and superconductivity with a maximum T_{\rm c} = 55 K (x\sim 0.2) was induced. Above 20% hydrogen substitution, T_{\rm c} was decreased, indicating that electron overdoping, which was not seen with F substitution in this system, was observed.^{32-34}

## II Experimental

CaFeAsH was synthesized by the solid-state reaction of CaAs, Fe_{2}As, and CaH_{2} with LiAlH_{4} as an excess hydrogen source, at 1000degC and 2 GPa (CaAs + Fe_{2}As + CaH_{2}\rightarrow 2CaFeAsH). A belt-type anvil cell was employed for the high-pressure synthesis. Powders of CaAs and Fe_{2}As were prepared from their respective metals (Ca: 99.99% Sigma-Aldrich, Fe: 99.9% Kojyundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd., and As: 99.999% Kojyundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd.) and CaH_{2}/CaD_{2} were synthesized by heating calcium metal in an H_{2}/D_{2} atmosphere. The solid solution of fluoride and hydride, CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x}, was obtained over the full x range by adding CaF_{2} to the starting mixture in the high-pressure synthesis, CaAs + Fe_{2}As + (1-x) CaF_{2} + x CaH_{2}\rightarrow 2CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x}. All starting materials and precursors for the synthesis were prepared in a glove box (Miwa Mfg. Co., Ltd.) filled with purified Ar gas (H_{2}O, O_{2}<1 ppm). The mixture of starting materials was placed into a BN capsule. Following the internal hydrogen source technique developed by Fukai and Okuma, [35, 36] LiAH_{4} (98%, Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd.) was also placed in the capsule with a BN separator as a supplementary hydrogen source. The deuterated analog, CaFeAsD, was also prepared using CaD_{2} and LiAlO_{4}(90% CP, 98% D, Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd.). Like CaFeAsF_{1-h}H_{x}, SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} was prepared by the solid-state reactions of SmAs, FeAs, Fe_{2}As, Sm_{2}O_{3}, and SmH_{2} at 2 GPa at 1200 degC; (2 + _x_) SmAs + (2 + _x_) Fe_{2}As + (2 - 2x) FeAs + (2 - 2x) Sm_{2}O_{3} + 3x SmH_{2}\rightarrow 6SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x}. SmAs and SmH_{2} were prepared by the reaction of Sm metal with arsenic or hydrogen gas. In this case, a mixture of NaBH_{4} and Ca(OH)_{2} was used as the excess hydrogen source.

The resulting crystalline phases were identified by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker AXS GmbH diffractometer model D8 ADVANCE (Cu-rotating anode). Rietveld analysis of XRD patterns was performed using the rotpas code. [37] The amount of hydrogen incorporated in the resulting samples was evaluated by thermogravimetry and mass spectroscopy (TG-MS) performed using a Bruker AXS GmbH TG-DTA/MS9610 equipped with a gas feed port to inject the standard H_{2} gas into the sample chamber. Twenty milligrams of sample were heated to 800 degC with a heating rate of 20 Kmin^{-1} under a helium gas flow. Hydrogen released from the sample, in the form of an H_{2} molecule was ionized and was detected by a quadrupole mass spectrometer as an ion with mass-to-charge ratio (_m_/_z_) = 2. Elemental composition of SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} (Sm:Fe:As:O) was determined by a JEOL, Inc. JXA-8530F electron-probe microanalyzer (EPMA) equipped with a field-emission-type electron gun and wavelength dispersive x-ray detectors. The micrometer-scale compositions within the main phase were probed on five to ten focal points, and the results were averaged.

Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) of CaFeAsD was measured on \sim3 g of sample by the high-resolution powder diffractometer installed at the JRR-3 reactor of the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (beam collimation of 30^{\prime}-40^{\prime}-(sample)-6^{\prime} with neutron wavelength \lambda = 0.182 391 nm). Rietveld analyses of the NPD patterns were performed using the rietan-fp code. [38]

The dc resistivity and magnetic susceptibility were measured in the temperature range of 2-300 K, using a physical properties measurement system (Quantum Design, Inc.) with a vibrating sample magnetometer attachment.

To investigate the electronic structure of CaFeAsH, density functional theory calculations were performed using the generalized gradient approximation Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional [39] and the projected augmented plane-wave method [40] implemented in the Vienna _ab initio_ simulation program (vasp) code, [41] following Refs. [42] and [43]. A \sqrt{2}a\times\sqrt{2}b\times\sqrt{2}c supercell containing eight chemical formulas was used for the calculation, and the plane-wave basis set cutoff was set to 600 eV. For Brillouin-zone integrations to calculate the total energy and density of states (DOS), 4 x 4 x 2 Monkhorst-Pack grids of k points were used. To obtain the projected DOS, the charge density was decomposed over the atom-centered spherical harmonics with a Wigner-Seitz radius r = (3_V_cell/4_p_N)1/3, where _V_cell and N are the unit-cell volume and the number of atoms in a unit cell, respectively.

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1(a) shows powder XRD patterns of the resulting products at RT. Except for several minor peaks due to metal Fe and Ca(OH_{2})/Ca(OD_{2}) phases (< 5 wt%), all the peaks could be indexed to a tetragonal ZrCuSiAs-type [18] structure (space group:P4/_m_/_m_) with lattice constants a = 0.3878 and c = 0.8260 nm for CaFeAsH and a = 0.3876 and c = 0.8257 nm for CaFeAsD. [44] The differences in the lattice constants between the hydride and the deuteride versions were less than 0.05%. Rietveld analysis indicates that the observed XRD pattern is well explained by assuming a model structure composed of alternate layers of FeAs and CaH (CaD). However, the site position and occupancy of hydrogen cannot be determined by XRD because the x-ray atomic scattering factor of H^{-}/D^{-} is too small.

As shown in Fig. 1(b), weight loss involving the emission of the H_{2} molecule was observed from 200 degC to 600 degC. The TG-MS measurement continued to 800 degC, where the sample decomposed into a mixture of CaFe_{2}As_{2}, FeAs, and unknown phases probably consisting of Ca with O_{2}, N_{2}, and/or H_{2}O gas from the He gas flow. The amount of released H_{2} was estimated to be 3.08 mmol/g from the integration of the mass peak _m_/_z_ = 2. This quantity was almost equal to that expected for the decomposition of CaFeAsH(2CaFeAsH \rightarrow Ca + CaFe_{2}As_{2} + H_{2}^{\uparrow}, 2.91 mmol/g).

Since the coherent neutron scattering cross section of deuterium (5.592 b) is comparable to that of Ca (2.78), Fe (11.22), or As (5.44), [45] the atomic position and site occupancy of deuterium can be determined by NPD. Figure 1(c) shows NPD patterns observed at RT and 10 K. Rietveld analyses revealed that the anion site in the block layer is occupied by deuterium, with the site occupancy of 0.935. [44] Taking the isotopic purity of the LiAlD_{4} and the inclusion of hydrogen from other starting materials into account, we conclude that the remaining fraction (0.065) of the anion site is primarily occupied by hydrogen. The NPD pattern observed at 10 K was attributed to an orthorhombic phase, space group: _Cmma_, a = 0.549 213(16), b = 0.545 660(16), and c = 0.821 154(24) nm. This crystal symmetry change is the same as in other 1111-type iron arsenides with tetragonal to orthorhombic transitions reported in the range of 120-180 K. High-pressure synthesis appears to be essential for the formation of CaFeAsH because no such phase could be prepared at ambient pressures.

Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of dc electrical resistivity (\rho) in CaFeAsH and CaFeAsD measured from 300 to 2 K. Both samples exhibit sudden decreases at \sim100 K (T_{\rm{anom}}). This anomaly has also been observed in 1111- and 122-type iron arsenides and has been attributed to a tetragonal to orthorhombic transition.

Figure 2(b) shows the calculated total DOS and PDOS of CaFeAsH. The total energy was minimized with respect to both the coordinates of all atoms and the lattice parameters. Then, the stripe-type antiferromagnetic ordering of the Fe spins, commonly observed for 1111-type Fe arsenides below T_{\rm{anom}}, was obtained as the most stable magnetic structure. Total DOS and Fe PDOS profiles revealed the semimetallic nature of CaFeAsH, with Fe 3d up-spin and down-spin bands overlapped at the Fermi level (_E_ = 0). Hydrogen 1s levels were located

 at \sim2 eV below the Fermi level and were fully occupied. It is evident from these results that hydrogen is incorporated as H^{-} (1s^{2}) in CaFeAsH. This finding is consistent with the similarities in the \rho-T curves of CaFeAsH and CaFeAsF, indicating that the replacement of F sites with H^{-} ions does not seriously affect the electronic structure of the FeAs conduction layer.

Based on the similarity of the charge and size of the hydride and fluorine ion, the formation of the solid solution CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x} was expected. Figure 2(c) shows the lattice parameters a and c as a function of x. The value of x in the resulting CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x} was evaluated by TG-MS measurement. While the lattice parameter a was almost independent of x, the value of c was proportional to x, indicating that the geometry of the CaF_{1-x}H_{x} layer is determined by the weighted average of the ionic radius of F^{-} (r_{\rm F}) and H^{-} (r_{\rm H}). From the F-Ca distance (r_{\rm F} + r_{\rm Ca} = 233.7 pm) and the H-Ca bond length (r_{\rm H} + r_{\rm Ca} = 230.2 pm) evaluated from Rietveld analysis, the ionic radius of H^{-} was estimated for 1111-type iron arsenides. On the assumption that an F^{-} coordinated by four Ca^{2+} ions retains Shannon's ionic radius (r_{\rm F} = 131 pm),[46] then, the ionic radius of Ca^{2+} was calculated to be 102.7 pm. The radius of H^{-} calculated from the H-Ca bond length (230.2 pm) in CaFeAsH is 127.5 pm, which is smaller than that of F^{-} by 2.8%.

  Chevalier _et al._[47] reported the synthesis of 1111-type hydrides Ln_MX_H (_M_ = Mn, Fe, and Co; X = Si and Ge). These crystals, with stacks of alternating LnH hydride layers and _MX_ layers, were made by hydrogen insertion onto CeFeSi-type [48] Ln_MX_. In contrast, the present high-pressure synthesis using hydrides does not require the precursor.

Then, the hydrogen-substitution technique was applied to electron doping in SmFeAsO. Figure 3(a) shows

  representative powder XRD patterns of SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} (nominal x values in starting mixtures are 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5). When nominal x exceeds \sim0.4, the SmAs phase begins to segregate, implying the actual hydrogen content (x) is lower than the nominal x. Figure 3(b) shows the TG-MS profile (m/z=2) of SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} with nominal x = 0.15. Hydrogen incorporated in SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} was released between 400 ^{\circ}C and 800 ^{\circ}C. The shape of the emission curve is close to that of CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x}. Figure 3(c) compares the hydrogen content (x) and the deficient amount of oxygen (y) in prepared samples per chemical formula (SmFeAsO_{1}-yH_{x}) as a function of nominal x in the starting mixture. The former value was determined by TG-MS, and the latter was measured with EPMA. For nominal x\leqslant 0.4, the hydrogen content agrees with y and the nominal x, indicating the oxygen site (O^{2-}) was successfully substituted with hydrogen (H^{-}). Figure 3(d) shows the variation of lattice constants a and c of the SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} system. Same as CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x}, the decrease of c with x corresponds to the difference in ionic radii between O^{2-} (142 pm) and H^{-} (127.5 pm in CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x}). On the other hand, a of the SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} system apparently decreases with x. This result contrasts with the CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x} system in which a is independent of x. It is likely to be a result of electron doping in the FeAs layer by H substitution (O^{2-} = H^{-} + e^{-}), i.e., the doped electrons occupy the bonding states (i.e., a hole pocket) of the FeAs layer and shorten the intralayer Fe-Fe distance.

Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity in SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x}. A sudden drop of resistivity due to superconductivity was observed for x\geqslant 0.03, and the maximum critical temperature T_{\rm c} (onset) was 55 K at x\sim 0.2. As x increased over 0.2, T_{\rm c} decreased, indicating the appearance of an overdoped region. To reveal the change in transport properties of the normal conducting state with hydrogen substitution, we examined the exponent n of \rho(T)\sim T^{n} for each sample by fitting the data to \rho(T)=\rho_{0} + AT^{n} in the temperature range between T just above T_{\rm c} and T = 130 K, where \rho_{0} is the residual component of resistivity. Figure 4(b) shows the results; n decreases from 2 to 1 with x below the optimal substitution level (x< 0.2), while \rho_{0} rapidly decreases to 0. The T^{2} dependence to high temperature is characteristic for strongly correlated Fermi liquid systems in which electron-electron interaction dominates the scattering of the carriers.[49]T linear dependence at the optimal level indicates a non-Fermi liquid state was induced by electron doping via hydrogen substitution. Similar behaviors have also been observed in 122-type and some 1111-type iron arsenides.[50, 51] On the contrary, n deceases to 0.5 in the overdoping region (x> 0.2). This is quite different from 122-type arsenide in which n again is close to \sim2 in the overdoping region. Figure 4(c) shows magnetic susceptibility (4\pi\,\chi) vs T plots of x = 0.03-0.47 samples under ZFC and FC with a magnetic field of 10 Oe. The diamagnetism due to superconductivity was observed below T_{\rm c} (mag) for x = 0.07-0.43. Shielding volume

(b) Log [\rho(T)-\rho_{0}] vs log T plots for data on the nonsuperconducting region, where \rho_{0} is the residual component of resistivity obtained from fitting (see text).

 fraction (SVF) of each sample was obtained from the gradient of the liner region in the magnetization (M) vs the field (H) plot observed at 2 K [Fig. 4(d)]. The SVF above 45% observed for x=0.07-0.43 indicates the bulk superconductivity, whereas, the SVF in x=0.03 and 0.47 samples is lower than 1%. Such a low SVF implies that the zero resistivity is due to the inhomogeneity of hydrogen concentration not bulk superconductivity. The sample of x=0.03 shows both the sudden drop of resistivity due to superconducting transition (T_{\rm c} = 5 K) and the \rho-T anomaly (T_{\rm anorm}=114 K) due to crystallographic transition accompanied with magnetic ordering of the Fe spins. Similar behavior has been observed in SmFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} around x\sim 0.04. [32] These data imply the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetic ordering in the limited x range near 0.03-0.04. While such coexistence has been confirmed in 122-type iron-arsenide superconductors, [26] it is hard to distinguish from the coexistence in systems with compositional disorder. Detailed experiments using an appropriate microprobe, such as \muSR are required to clarify the intrinsic nature of this coexistence. Figure 4(e) shows the x-T diagram of SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} superimposed with that of SmFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} with the fluorine content x measured by EPMA as reported by Kohler and Behr [33] in which the T_{\rm c} vs x plots of SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} and SmFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} overlap at x<0.15, indicating that hydrogen gives indirect electron doping to the FeAs layer just like fluorine. While the solubility limit of fluorine in the oxygen site is restricted to less than 20% (x=0.2), [33, 34] hydrogen can reach 40%. The wider substitution range is useful for the optimization of the electron-doping level to induce superconductivity and to complete the electronic phase diagram, including the overdoped region.

## IV Summary

The 1111-type CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x} (0<x\leqslant 1) and SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} (0<x\leqslant 0.4) were synthesized by a high-pressure technique with an excess hydrogen source. Substitution of H^{-} into the F^{-} site in CaFeAsF was confirmed by NPD analysis and density functional calculations. The resulting CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x} were nonsuperconducting with a \rho-T anomaly at \sim100 K due to a tetragonal to orthorhombic transition commonly observed in AeFeAsF and LnFeAsO. In SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} (0<x\leqslant 0.4), H^{-} substitution into the O^{2-} site supplies electrons to the FeAs layer, giving rise to superconductivity with an optimized T_{\rm c} of 55 K. Further H^{-} substitution beyond the optimal level leads to a decrease in T_{\rm c} up to x=0.4. The present results suggest the hydrogen (H^{-}) substitution to the anion site is generally applicable for electron doping in 1111-type iron-arsenide superconductors.

###### Abstract

Utilizing the high stability of calcium and rare-earth hydrides, CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x} (x = 0.0-1.0) and SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} (x = 0.0-0.47) have been synthesized using high pressure to form hydrogen-substituted 1111-type iron-arsenide superconductors. Neutron diffraction and density functional calculations have demonstrated that the hydrogens are incorporated as H^{-} ions occupying F^{-} sites in the blocking layer of CaFeAsF. The resulting CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x} is nonsuperconducting, whereas, SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} is a superconductor, with an optimal T_{\rm c} = 55 K at x\sim 0.2. It was found that up to 40% of the O^{2-} ions can be replaced by H^{-} ions, with electrons being supplied into the FeAs layer to maintain neutrality (O^{2-} = H^{-} + e^{-}). When x exceeded 0.2, T_{\rm c} was reduced corresponding to an electron overdoped region.

## I Introduction

Since the discovery of superconductivity in LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} (T_{\rm c} = 28 K),^{1} layered iron pnictides and related materials have been intensively investigated as candidates for high-T_{\rm c} superconductors. To date, various types of iron-based superconductors have been synthesized,^{2-}[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] with the highest T_{\rm c} of \sim 55 K being recorded in SmFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1}.^{12-17} The 111-type iron arsenides LnFeAsO (Ln = lanthanide) with a ZrCuSiAs-type structure [18] are composed of stacks of alternating FeAs anti-fluorite-type conducting layers and LnO fluorite-type blocking layers. Although the parent compounds are nonsuperconducting at ambient pressures, they are superconducting when electrons are doped into the FeAs layer via fluorine substitution at the oxygen sites (O^{2-} = F^{-} + e^{-}),^{1,13-17} oxygen vacancy formation (O^{2-} = V_{0} + 2e^{-}),^{19-21} or transition-metal (TM, with excess electrons when compared with Fe, such as Co or Ni) substitution into the iron site.^{22-25} TM substitution, adding electrons to the FeAs layer, is a direct doping mode, whereas, F-substitution or O-vacancy formation is an indirect mode because impurities are doped to the blocking layers and the electrons are transferred to the FeAs layers. The general consensus is that indirect doping gives a higher T_{\rm c} because less structural and electrical disturbances occur in the superconducting layers. However, overdoping via the indirect mode has not been confirmed for most 1111-type iron arsenides. In other words, further improvement in the T_{\rm c} may be possible. For example, the solubility limit of fluorine substitution in LnFeAsO is lower than 20%. This fact is in contrast to alkali-metal substitution in 122-type Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} superconductors in which the Ba site can fully be replaced by K.^{26} This restraint also makes it difficult to complete the electronic phase diagram (doping level vs critical temperatures) beyond the optimal doping level. Completion of the phase diagram is important not only to improve T_{\rm c}, but also to understand superconductivity. Besides, although several papers have reported on the variation of T_{\rm c} with nominal oxygen vacancy or hydrogen content in the 1111 system, the chemical states and the analyzed composition have not been clarified to date.^{19,20,27-29} This ambiguity is an obstacle for understanding the emerging and carrier concentration dependence on T_{\rm c}.

In this paper, we propose a method for indirect electron doping to induce superconductivity in 1111-type iron arsenides. By using a high-pressure synthesis method with an excess hydrogen source, CaFeAsH, an analog of LnFeAsO, and the solid solution between CaFeAsF^{30,31} and CaFeAsH (CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x} where 0\leqslant x\leqslant 1) have been synthesized. While CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x} is nonsuperconducting like LnFeAsO, these results indicate the anion site in the blocking layer can be substituted with H^{-}. Considering the facile formation of metal hydrides with rare earths, H^{-} appears to be stabilized in these rare-earth compounds. Thus, the hydrogen substitution technique has been applied to electron doping in SmFeAsO as with fluorine substitution (O^{2-} = H^{-} + e^{-}). Up to 40% of the oxygen sites were replaced successfully by hydrogen (SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x}, 0<x\leqslant 0.4), and superconductivity with a maximum T_{\rm c} = 55 K (x\sim 0.2) was induced. Above 20% hydrogen substitution, T_{\rm c} was decreased, indicating that electron overdoping, which was not seen with F substitution in this system, was observed.^{32-34}

## II Experimental

CaFeAsH was synthesized by the solid-state reaction of CaAs, Fe_{2}As, and CaH_{2} with LiAlH_{4} as an excess hydrogen source, at 1000degC and 2 GPa (CaAs + Fe_{2}As + CaH_{2}\rightarrow 2CaFeAsH). A belt-type anvil cell was employed for the high-pressure synthesis. Powders of CaAs and Fe_{2}As were prepared from their respective metals (Ca: 99.99% Sigma-Aldrich, Fe: 99.9% Kojyundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd., and As: 99.999% Kojyundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd.) and CaH_{2}/CaD_{2} were synthesized by heating calcium metal in an H_{2}/D_{2} atmosphere. The solid solution of fluoride and hydride, CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x}, was obtained over the full x range by adding CaF_{2} to the starting mixture in the high-pressure synthesis, CaAs + Fe_{2}As + (1-x) CaF_{2} + x CaH_{2}\rightarrow 2CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x}. All starting materials and precursors for the synthesis were prepared in a glove box (Miwa Mfg. Co., Ltd.) filled with purified Ar gas (H_{2}O, O_{2}<1 ppm). The mixture of starting materials was placed into a BN capsule. Following the internal hydrogen source technique developed by Fukai and Okuma, [35, 36] LiAH_{4} (98%, Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd.) was also placed in the capsule with a BN separator as a supplementary hydrogen source. The deuterated analog, CaFeAsD, was also prepared using CaD_{2} and LiAlO_{4}(90% CP, 98% D, Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd.). Like CaFeAsF_{1-h}H_{x}, SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} was prepared by the solid-state reactions of SmAs, FeAs, Fe_{2}As, Sm_{2}O_{3}, and SmH_{2} at 2 GPa at 1200 degC; (2 + _x_) SmAs + (2 + _x_) Fe_{2}As + (2 - 2x) FeAs + (2 - 2x) Sm_{2}O_{3} + 3x SmH_{2}\rightarrow 6SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x}. SmAs and SmH_{2} were prepared by the reaction of Sm metal with arsenic or hydrogen gas. In this case, a mixture of NaBH_{4} and Ca(OH)_{2} was used as the excess hydrogen source.

The resulting crystalline phases were identified by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker AXS GmbH diffractometer model D8 ADVANCE (Cu-rotating anode). Rietveld analysis of XRD patterns was performed using the rotpas code. [37] The amount of hydrogen incorporated in the resulting samples was evaluated by thermogravimetry and mass spectroscopy (TG-MS) performed using a Bruker AXS GmbH TG-DTA/MS9610 equipped with a gas feed port to inject the standard H_{2} gas into the sample chamber. Twenty milligrams of sample were heated to 800 degC with a heating rate of 20 Kmin^{-1} under a helium gas flow. Hydrogen released from the sample, in the form of an H_{2} molecule was ionized and was detected by a quadrupole mass spectrometer as an ion with mass-to-charge ratio (_m_/_z_) = 2. Elemental composition of SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} (Sm:Fe:As:O) was determined by a JEOL, Inc. JXA-8530F electron-probe microanalyzer (EPMA) equipped with a field-emission-type electron gun and wavelength dispersive x-ray detectors. The micrometer-scale compositions within the main phase were probed on five to ten focal points, and the results were averaged.

Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) of CaFeAsD was measured on \sim3 g of sample by the high-resolution powder diffractometer installed at the JRR-3 reactor of the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (beam collimation of 30^{\prime}-40^{\prime}-(sample)-6^{\prime} with neutron wavelength \lambda = 0.182 391 nm). Rietveld analyses of the NPD patterns were performed using the rietan-fp code. [38]

The dc resistivity and magnetic susceptibility were measured in the temperature range of 2-300 K, using a physical properties measurement system (Quantum Design, Inc.) with a vibrating sample magnetometer attachment.

To investigate the electronic structure of CaFeAsH, density functional theory calculations were performed using the generalized gradient approximation Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional [39] and the projected augmented plane-wave method [40] implemented in the Vienna _ab initio_ simulation program (vasp) code, [41] following Refs. [42] and [43]. A \sqrt{2}a\times\sqrt{2}b\times\sqrt{2}c supercell containing eight chemical formulas was used for the calculation, and the plane-wave basis set cutoff was set to 600 eV. For Brillouin-zone integrations to calculate the total energy and density of states (DOS), 4 x 4 x 2 Monkhorst-Pack grids of k points were used. To obtain the projected DOS, the charge density was decomposed over the atom-centered spherical harmonics with a Wigner-Seitz radius r = (3_V_cell/4_p_N)1/3, where _V_cell and N are the unit-cell volume and the number of atoms in a unit cell, respectively.

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1(a) shows powder XRD patterns of the resulting products at RT. Except for several minor peaks due to metal Fe and Ca(OH_{2})/Ca(OD_{2}) phases (< 5 wt%), all the peaks could be indexed to a tetragonal ZrCuSiAs-type [18] structure (space group:P4/_m_/_m_) with lattice constants a = 0.3878 and c = 0.8260 nm for CaFeAsH and a = 0.3876 and c = 0.8257 nm for CaFeAsD. [44] The differences in the lattice constants between the hydride and the deuteride versions were less than 0.05%. Rietveld analysis indicates that the observed XRD pattern is well explained by assuming a model structure composed of alternate layers of FeAs and CaH (CaD). However, the site position and occupancy of hydrogen cannot be determined by XRD because the x-ray atomic scattering factor of H^{-}/D^{-} is too small.

As shown in Fig. 1(b), weight loss involving the emission of the H_{2} molecule was observed from 200 degC to 600 degC. The TG-MS measurement continued to 800 degC, where the sample decomposed into a mixture of CaFe_{2}As_{2}, FeAs, and unknown phases probably consisting of Ca with O_{2}, N_{2}, and/or H_{2}O gas from the He gas flow. The amount of released H_{2} was estimated to be 3.08 mmol/g from the integration of the mass peak _m_/_z_ = 2. This quantity was almost equal to that expected for the decomposition of CaFeAsH(2CaFeAsH \rightarrow Ca + CaFe_{2}As_{2} + H_{2}^{\uparrow}, 2.91 mmol/g).

Since the coherent neutron scattering cross section of deuterium (5.592 b) is comparable to that of Ca (2.78), Fe (11.22), or As (5.44), [45] the atomic position and site occupancy of deuterium can be determined by NPD. Figure 1(c) shows NPD patterns observed at RT and 10 K. Rietveld analyses revealed that the anion site in the block layer is occupied by deuterium, with the site occupancy of 0.935. [44] Taking the isotopic purity of the LiAlD_{4} and the inclusion of hydrogen from other starting materials into account, we conclude that the remaining fraction (0.065) of the anion site is primarily occupied by hydrogen. The NPD pattern observed at 10 K was attributed to an orthorhombic phase, space group: _Cmma_, a = 0.549 213(16), b = 0.545 660(16), and c = 0.821 154(24) nm. This crystal symmetry change is the same as in other 1111-type iron arsenides with tetragonal to orthorhombic transitions reported in the range of 120-180 K. High-pressure synthesis appears to be essential for the formation of CaFeAsH because no such phase could be prepared at ambient pressures.

Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of dc electrical resistivity (\rho) in CaFeAsH and CaFeAsD measured from 300 to 2 K. Both samples exhibit sudden decreases at \sim100 K (T_{\rm{anom}}). This anomaly has also been observed in 1111- and 122-type iron arsenides and has been attributed to a tetragonal to orthorhombic transition.

Figure 2(b) shows the calculated total DOS and PDOS of CaFeAsH. The total energy was minimized with respect to both the coordinates of all atoms and the lattice parameters. Then, the stripe-type antiferromagnetic ordering of the Fe spins, commonly observed for 1111-type Fe arsenides below T_{\rm{anom}}, was obtained as the most stable magnetic structure. Total DOS and Fe PDOS profiles revealed the semimetallic nature of CaFeAsH, with Fe 3d up-spin and down-spin bands overlapped at the Fermi level (_E_ = 0). Hydrogen 1s levels were located

 at \sim2 eV below the Fermi level and were fully occupied. It is evident from these results that hydrogen is incorporated as H^{-} (1s^{2}) in CaFeAsH. This finding is consistent with the similarities in the \rho-T curves of CaFeAsH and CaFeAsF, indicating that the replacement of F sites with H^{-} ions does not seriously affect the electronic structure of the FeAs conduction layer.

Based on the similarity of the charge and size of the hydride and fluorine ion, the formation of the solid solution CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x} was expected. Figure 2(c) shows the lattice parameters a and c as a function of x. The value of x in the resulting CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x} was evaluated by TG-MS measurement. While the lattice parameter a was almost independent of x, the value of c was proportional to x, indicating that the geometry of the CaF_{1-x}H_{x} layer is determined by the weighted average of the ionic radius of F^{-} (r_{\rm F}) and H^{-} (r_{\rm H}). From the F-Ca distance (r_{\rm F} + r_{\rm Ca} = 233.7 pm) and the H-Ca bond length (r_{\rm H} + r_{\rm Ca} = 230.2 pm) evaluated from Rietveld analysis, the ionic radius of H^{-} was estimated for 1111-type iron arsenides. On the assumption that an F^{-} coordinated by four Ca^{2+} ions retains Shannon's ionic radius (r_{\rm F} = 131 pm),[46] then, the ionic radius of Ca^{2+} was calculated to be 102.7 pm. The radius of H^{-} calculated from the H-Ca bond length (230.2 pm) in CaFeAsH is 127.5 pm, which is smaller than that of F^{-} by 2.8%.

  Chevalier _et al._[47] reported the synthesis of 1111-type hydrides Ln_MX_H (_M_ = Mn, Fe, and Co; X = Si and Ge). These crystals, with stacks of alternating LnH hydride layers and _MX_ layers, were made by hydrogen insertion onto CeFeSi-type [48] Ln_MX_. In contrast, the present high-pressure synthesis using hydrides does not require the precursor.

Then, the hydrogen-substitution technique was applied to electron doping in SmFeAsO. Figure 3(a) shows

(c) Oxygen deficiency content determined by EPMA measurement (_y_) and hydrogen content estimated by the TG-MS method (_x_) in SmFeAsO1−,H2 as a function of nominal x in the starting mixture. The measured x is almost equal to y and nominal x, indicating the deficiency of the oxygen site is wholly compensated by the occupation of hydrogen. (d) Lattice constants (_α_ and _c_) as a function of x.

  representative powder XRD patterns of SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} (nominal x values in starting mixtures are 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5). When nominal x exceeds \sim0.4, the SmAs phase begins to segregate, implying the actual hydrogen content (x) is lower than the nominal x. Figure 3(b) shows the TG-MS profile (m/z=2) of SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} with nominal x = 0.15. Hydrogen incorporated in SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} was released between 400 ^{\circ}C and 800 ^{\circ}C. The shape of the emission curve is close to that of CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x}. Figure 3(c) compares the hydrogen content (x) and the deficient amount of oxygen (y) in prepared samples per chemical formula (SmFeAsO_{1}-yH_{x}) as a function of nominal x in the starting mixture. The former value was determined by TG-MS, and the latter was measured with EPMA. For nominal x\leqslant 0.4, the hydrogen content agrees with y and the nominal x, indicating the oxygen site (O^{2-}) was successfully substituted with hydrogen (H^{-}). Figure 3(d) shows the variation of lattice constants a and c of the SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} system. Same as CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x}, the decrease of c with x corresponds to the difference in ionic radii between O^{2-} (142 pm) and H^{-} (127.5 pm in CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x}). On the other hand, a of the SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} system apparently decreases with x. This result contrasts with the CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x} system in which a is independent of x. It is likely to be a result of electron doping in the FeAs layer by H substitution (O^{2-} = H^{-} + e^{-}), i.e., the doped electrons occupy the bonding states (i.e., a hole pocket) of the FeAs layer and shorten the intralayer Fe-Fe distance.

Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity in SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x}. A sudden drop of resistivity due to superconductivity was observed for x\geqslant 0.03, and the maximum critical temperature T_{\rm c} (onset) was 55 K at x\sim 0.2. As x increased over 0.2, T_{\rm c} decreased, indicating the appearance of an overdoped region. To reveal the change in transport properties of the normal conducting state with hydrogen substitution, we examined the exponent n of \rho(T)\sim T^{n} for each sample by fitting the data to \rho(T)=\rho_{0} + AT^{n} in the temperature range between T just above T_{\rm c} and T = 130 K, where \rho_{0} is the residual component of resistivity. Figure 4(b) shows the results; n decreases from 2 to 1 with x below the optimal substitution level (x< 0.2), while \rho_{0} rapidly decreases to 0. The T^{2} dependence to high temperature is characteristic for strongly correlated Fermi liquid systems in which electron-electron interaction dominates the scattering of the carriers.[49]T linear dependence at the optimal level indicates a non-Fermi liquid state was induced by electron doping via hydrogen substitution. Similar behaviors have also been observed in 122-type and some 1111-type iron arsenides.[50, 51] On the contrary, n deceases to 0.5 in the overdoping region (x> 0.2). This is quite different from 122-type arsenide in which n again is close to \sim2 in the overdoping region. Figure 4(c) shows magnetic susceptibility (4\pi\,\chi) vs T plots of x = 0.03-0.47 samples under ZFC and FC with a magnetic field of 10 Oe. The diamagnetism due to superconductivity was observed below T_{\rm c} (mag) for x = 0.07-0.43. Shielding volume

 fraction (SVF) of each sample was obtained from the gradient of the liner region in the magnetization (M) vs the field (H) plot observed at 2 K [Fig. 4(d)]. The SVF above 45% observed for x=0.07-0.43 indicates the bulk superconductivity, whereas, the SVF in x=0.03 and 0.47 samples is lower than 1%. Such a low SVF implies that the zero resistivity is due to the inhomogeneity of hydrogen concentration not bulk superconductivity. The sample of x=0.03 shows both the sudden drop of resistivity due to superconducting transition (T_{\rm c} = 5 K) and the \rho-T anomaly (T_{\rm anorm}=114 K) due to crystallographic transition accompanied with magnetic ordering of the Fe spins. Similar behavior has been observed in SmFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} around x\sim 0.04. [32] These data imply the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetic ordering in the limited x range near 0.03-0.04. While such coexistence has been confirmed in 122-type iron-arsenide superconductors, [26] it is hard to distinguish from the coexistence in systems with compositional disorder. Detailed experiments using an appropriate microprobe, such as \muSR are required to clarify the intrinsic nature of this coexistence. Figure 4(e) shows the x-T diagram of SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} superimposed with that of SmFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} with the fluorine content x measured by EPMA as reported by Kohler and Behr [33] in which the T_{\rm c} vs x plots of SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} and SmFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} overlap at x<0.15, indicating that hydrogen gives indirect electron doping to the FeAs layer just like fluorine. While the solubility limit of fluorine in the oxygen site is restricted to less than 20% (x=0.2), [33, 34] hydrogen can reach 40%. The wider substitution range is useful for the optimization of the electron-doping level to induce superconductivity and to complete the electronic phase diagram, including the overdoped region.

## IV Summary

The 1111-type CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x} (0<x\leqslant 1) and SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} (0<x\leqslant 0.4) were synthesized by a high-pressure technique with an excess hydrogen source. Substitution of H^{-} into the F^{-} site in CaFeAsF was confirmed by NPD analysis and density functional calculations. The resulting CaFeAsF_{1-x}H_{x} were nonsuperconducting with a \rho-T anomaly at \sim100 K due to a tetragonal to orthorhombic transition commonly observed in AeFeAsF and LnFeAsO. In SmFeAsO_{1-x}H_{x} (0<x\leqslant 0.4), H^{-} substitution into the O^{2-} site supplies electrons to the FeAs layer, giving rise to superconductivity with an optimized T_{\rm c} of 55 K. Further H^{-} substitution beyond the optimal level leads to a decrease in T_{\rm c} up to x=0.4. The present results suggest the hydrogen (H^{-}) substitution to the anion site is generally applicable for electron doping in 1111-type iron-arsenide superconductors.
