###### Abstract

The superconducting pairing state of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is studied by measuring the magnetic penetration depth \lambda(T,B) and superfluid density \rho_{s}(T) using a tunnel-dode-oscillator (TDO)-based method and transverse-field muon-spin rotation (TF-\muSR) spectroscopy. The penetration depth follows an exponential-type temperature dependence at T\ll T_{c}, but increases linearly with magnetic field at T=1.5 K. A detailed analysis demonstrates that both \lambda_{L}(T) and \rho_{T}^{\rm TDO}(T), measured in the Hessner state using the TDO method, are well described by a two-gap \gamma model with gap sizes of \Delta_{1}(0)=1.31k_{B}T_{c} and \Delta_{2}(0)=1.80k_{B}T_{c}, and weak interband coupling. In contrast, \rho_{s}^{\mu\rm SR}(T), derived from the \muSR data, can be fitted by a single-gap BCS model with a gap close to \Delta_{2}(0). We conclude that LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is a marginal two-gap superconductor and the small gap \Delta_{1} seems to be suppressed by a small magnetic field applied in the \muSR experiments. In comparison, the 4 f electrons in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} may enhance the interband coupling and, therefore, give rise to more robust multiband superconductivity.

The discovery of superconductivity (SC) in a series of Pr-based skutterudite compounds, i.e., PrT_{d}X_{12} (T = Fe, Ru, Os, and X = pnictogen), has attracted considerable interest. Despite intensive investigations of the physical properties of these compounds, their superconducting order parameter and, therefore, the pairing mechanism remains highly controversial [1], with evidence for nodal superconductivity in some compounds and conventional BCS SC in others. Even for the same compound, most prominently, the heavy-fermion superconductor PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, the gap symmetry is still under debate. Here, the early measurements provided evidence of point nodes with a possible triplet pairing state [2, 3, 4]. Upon improving the sample homogeneity and measuring to lower temperatures, recent measurements give evidence for multiband SC in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}[5, 6]. Exploration of other filled skutterudite superconductors may help to elucidate the superconducting pairing state and the question of its universality.

A family of Ge-based skutterudites with T_{c} ranging from 5 to 8.3 K, i.e., MPt_{4}Ge_{12} (M = \pi, Ba, La, Pr), was discovered a few years ago [7, 8, 9, 10]. Much as PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, zero-field muon-spin rotation (\muSR) experiments showed evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in the superconducting state of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, but not for LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. However, more recent experiments suggested multigap SC for PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[14, 15, 16]. Furthermore, a coherence peak was observed in the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T_{1} just below T_{c} for PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, which is unexpectedly suppressed in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}[17]. However, the weak variation of T_{c} and of the specific heat jump at T_{c} with the Pr content x in La_{1-x}Pt_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} suggests that the order parameters of the two end members are similar [12]. Thus, LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is not a simple reference compound of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, as seen in many heavy-fermion systems. In order to clarify the superconducting order parameter in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, further investigations are badly needed. Furthermore, a comparative study of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} could shed new light on the role of Pr-4 f electrons in the formation of SC and, therefore, provide a more general picture of the pairing states in skutterudite superconductors.

In this Rapid Communication, we report a comprehensive study of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda(T,B) and superfluid density \rho_{s}(T) of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} using \muSR and a tunnel-diode-oscillator (TDO)-based technique. The London penetration depth \lambda_{L}(T), measured by the TDO method, follows exponential-type behavior in the low-temperature limit, suggesting nodeless SC for LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}. The penetration depth \lambda_{m}(B), determined from the \muSR experiments at T = 1.5 K, follows a linear field dependence, giving evidence for multigap SC. The superfluid density \rho_{s}^{\rm TDO}(T), converted from \lambda_{L}(T), is best described by a two-gap \gamma model, with gap sizes of \Delta_{1}(0)=1.31k_{B}T_{c} and \Delta_{2}(0)=1.80k_{B}T_{c} at T = 0. However, the superfluid density \rho_{s}^{\mu\rm SR}(T) derived from \muSR with a transverse field of 75 mT is fitted by a conventional BCS model with a gap of \Delta(0)\approx\Delta_{2}(0). We argue that marginal two-gap SC exists in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and also some other skutterudite superconductors. Due to very weak interband coupling in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, the small gap may be destroyed by a weak magnetic field (as used in our \muSR measurements) or other perturbations.

Polycrystalline samples of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, as described in Ref. [7], were used for the \muSR experiments, which were performed using the \piM3 beamline at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland) down to temperatures of T=1.5 K on the General Purpose Surface-Muon instrument (GPS) and T\approx 0.02 K on the Low Temperature Facility (LTF) spectrometer.

 The samples were cooled in B_{\rm{app}}=75 mT from above T_{c} down to 1.5 K, and then measured as a function of temperature. At T=1.5 K, we also collected data in several applied magnetic fields. Typical counting statistics were 7-8\times 10^{6} positron events per data point. High quality single crystals of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, grown using multistep thermal treatments [15, 18], were utilized for the London penetration depth study by a TDO-based method. The ac field induced by the coil of the experimental setup was less than 2 \muT, which is much smaller than the lower critical field of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, guaranteeing that the sample was in the Meissner state. Typical sample dimensions were about 0.6\times 0.6\times 0.2 mm^{3}. The change of the London penetration depth \Delta\lambda_{L}(T) is proportional to the frequency shift, i.e., \Delta\lambda_{L}(T)=G\Delta f(T), where G is solely determined by the sample and coil geometries [19].

Figure 1(a) shows the Fourier transforms of the \muSR time spectra P(B) of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} at various temperatures for B_{\rm{app}}=75 mT. Above T_{c}=8.3 K, a narrow and sharp peak is visible in P(B), as is expected for weak nuclear depolarization. Upon lowering the temperature, the peak significantly broadens and becomes asymmetric, in accordance with the field distribution of a well arranged flux-line lattice (FLL). These features point to isotropic SC and weak pinning of the FLL in the polycrystalline samples. In this context, we adopt the exact solution of the Ginzburg-Landau equations following the method suggested by Brandt to analyze the data [20, 21]. The complete analysis of the data follows the procedures described in Ref. [22]. Accordingly, we considered the spatial magnetic field distribution B({\bf r})=B({\bf r},\lambda_{m},\xi,(B)) within the unit cell of the FLL, where \lambda_{m} is the magnetic penetration depth and \xi is the coherence length. The data are well fitted using the theoretical polarization function P(t) given in Ref. [22], as denoted by the solid lines in Fig. 1(a).

The mean value of the superfluid density can be expressed as \rho_{s}^{\mu}{\rm SR}\propto(1-b)/\lambda_{m}^{2}, where b=\langle B\rangle/B_{c2}(0) is the reduced field. In Fig. 1(b), we plot \rho_{s}^{\mu}{\rm SR} derived from the \muSR data as a function of temperature, which can be fitted by the conventional s-wave BCS model with a gap amplitude of \Delta(0)=1.9k_{B}T_{c}. The field dependence of the penetration depth provides an alternative method for probing the low-energy excitations. For nodal or multigap superconductors, the penetration depth \lambda_{m} depends on the applied magnetic field [23], but there is hardly any variation for conventional s-wave superconductors [24]. In the inset of Fig. 1(b) we show the field dependence of \lambda_{m} obtained at 1.5 K for several Pt_{4}Ge_{12}-based superconducting skutterudites. In order to avoid correlation effects between \lambda and \xi, the values of the coherence length \xi were fixed to 15.0, 14.2, 19.7, and 27.0 nm for the La-, Pt-, Sr-, and BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} skutterudites, respectively [25]. These values were obtained from the corresponding upper critical fields B_{c2} at 1.5 K using the Ginzburg-Landau relation B_{c2}=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi[11, 22]. For LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} we used B_{c2}(1.5 K) = 1.48 T [26]. \lambda_{m} of SrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} are independent of the applied field, as expected for s-wave SC with an isotropic gap [see Fig. 1(b)]. In contrast, \lambda_{m} of both LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} displays a linear field dependence with a similar slope, which remarkably resembles that of MgB_{2}[27], a prototype example of a two-band superconductor. Such behavior is compatible with multiband SC, as previously shown for PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[14, 15, 16], but is unexpected for a single-band BCS superconductor.

In order to understand this contradictory behavior, we measured the London penetration depth \Delta\lambda_{L}(T) using the TDO-based method for single-crystalline LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}. A sharp superconducting transition at T_{c}=8.2 K is observed in both the electrical resistivity \rho(T) and specific heat C_{es}(T)/T, as shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). Along with the residual resistivity ratio RRR = 16.3, this confirms the high quality of the LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} crystals. Figure 2(c) presents \Delta\lambda_{L}(T) for two samples from the same batch. The \Delta\lambda_{L}(T) data are well reproducible between the two samples, showing nearly temperature-independent behavior below 1.5 K. This provides further evidence for nodeless SC in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}. According

The inset shows \Delta\lambda_{L}(T) over a wide temperature range. For clarity, the \Delta\lambda_{L}(T) data of sample No. 2 are shifted by 10 Å. The solid lines present a fit of the BCS model to the experimental \Delta\lambda_{L}(T) at T\ll T_{c}.

For reasons of clarity, the data at each temperature were scaled and shifted vertically. The solid lines are fits to the data.

  to the BCS model, the penetration depth at T\ll T_{c} can be expressed by [28]\Delta\lambda(T)\approx\lambda(0)\sqrt{\frac{\pi\lambda(0)}{2k_{B}T}}\exp{(-\frac{ \Delta\lambda(0)}{k_{B}T})}, where \lambda(0) is the penetration depth at T=0. Here, we take the value of \lambda(0)\approx 120 nm from the \muSR results. Usually, the parameter \Delta(0) varies upon changing the fitted temperature range, but becomes saturated at sufficiently low temperatures. The solid lines in Fig. 2(c) represent the best fits to the BCS model in the low-temperature limit, giving \Delta(0)=1.39k_{B}T_{c} for sample No. 1 and \Delta(0)=1.34k_{B}T_{c} for sample No. 2. The fitted \Delta(0) is much smaller than the BCS value of \Delta(0)=1.76k_{B}T_{c}, indicating the appearance of a secondary gap at low temperatures or the anisotropic effect, which is unlikely in a cubic system.

In Fig. 3, we plot the normalized superfluid density \rho_{s}^{\rm TDO}(T)=\lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda_{L}^{2}(T) for LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, which shows an upward curvature near T_{c}. Such behavior may result from the underestimation of \lambda(0). As a comparison, the lower inset of Fig. 3 shows \rho_{s}^{\rm TDO}(T) calculated using different values of \lambda(0). Indeed, the upturn of \rho_{s}^{\rm TDO}(T) weakens with increasing \lambda(0); \rho_{s}^{\rm TDO}(T) resembles the \muSR data for \lambda(0)=250 nm, but still shows a clear deviation near T_{c}. It is noted that our samples have a regular geometry and the total uncertainties from the \lambda(0) value and the G factor in the TDO measurements should be limited to about 20%. Thus, such a large enhancement of \lambda(0) is also far beyond the uncertainties from our experiments. On the other hand, similar concave behavior was previously observed in some multiband superconductors with weak interband coupling [29]. Considering the fact that LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} possesses multiple Fermi surface sheets [7], it is reasonable to analyze \rho_{s}^{\rm TDO}(T) in terms of multiband SC.

According to the \gamma model [29], which applies generally to clean two-band superconductors, the total superfluid density can be written as \rho_{s}(T)=\gamma\rho_{1}[\Delta_{1}(0),T]+(1-\gamma)\rho_{2}[\Delta_{2}(0),T], where \gamma is the relative weight of the contribution from the gap \Delta_{1}. For a two-band system with known density of states n_{\mu} and Fermi velocities \nu_{u} (\mu=1,2), \gamma is determined by \gamma=n_{1}\langle v_{1}^{2}\rangle/(n_{1}\langle v_{1}^{2}\rangle+n_{2} \langle v_{2}^{2}\rangle). Here, \langle v_{\mu}^{2}\rangle represents the average of the squared Fermi velocities over the corresponding band. According to the electronic structure calculations [7], several energy bands cross the Fermi energy in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}. As an approximation, we group the major energy bands into two effective bands according to the values of Fermi velocity in each band, which gives n_{1}=0.12, n_{2}=0.88, and \nu_{1}/\nu_{2}\sim 2.3. Thus, a value of \gamma=0.42 is estimated. The partial superfluid density \rho_{\mu} and the energy gap \Delta_{\mu} are calculated self-consistently using the quasiclassic Eilenberger equations. Following the method described in Ref. [29], we fitted the experimental \rho_{s}^{\rm TDO}(T) with fitting parameters of \gamma and \lambda_{\mu\nu}, where \lambda_{\mu\nu} are the interband and intraband pairing couplings. The best-fit results, with \lambda_{11}=0.63,\lambda_{12}=0.0025, and \lambda_{22}=0.20, are shown in Fig. 3, which overlaps nicely with the experimental data. The derived values of n_{1}=0.23 and \gamma=0.4 are compatible with those estimated directly from the band structure calculations. Such a fit gives \Delta_{1}(0)=1.31k_{B}T_{c} and \Delta_{2}(0)=1.80k_{B}T_{c}; the small gap \Delta_{1}(0) agrees well with that obtained from the exponential fits of \Delta\lambda_{L}(T) at T\ll T_{c}, where \Delta(0)=1.39k_{B}T_{c}. As shown in the upper inset of Fig. 3, \Delta_{1}(T) exhibits non-BCS behavior, the rapid vanishing of \Delta_{1}(T) leads to the upturn in \rho_{s}^{\rm TDO}(T) near T_{c}.

Remarkably, the calculated partial superfluid density \rho_{2}(T) is nearly identical to \rho_{\mu}^{\rm sSR}(T) (see Fig. 3). Such an agreement suggests that the small energy gap is likely destroyed by the small magnetic field applied in the \muSR experiments. In a two-band superconductor with a vanishing \lambda_{12}, it was theoretically shown that the small gap may be suppressed at a largely reduced effective upper critical field [30]. The so-called "virtual" upper critical field B_{c2}^{*}, above which the vortex cores overlap and thus drive the majority of the electrons in the associated band normal, can be estimated by B_{c2}^{*}(0)\sim B_{c2}\langle 0|\lambda_{1}(0)v_{2}/\Delta_{2}(0)\nu_{1}|^{2}. For LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, a value of B_{c2}^{*}(0)\sim 150 mT is estimated by using the parameters derived above and B_{c2}(0)=1.6 T [26]. The small B_{c2}^{*}(0) may account for the discrepancy between \rho_{s}(T) determined from the TDO and \muSR experiments. In the TDO measurements, the sample is in the Meissner state, which allows us to detect both the large and the small gaps. On the other hand, the transverse-field muon-spin rotation (TF-\muSR) measurements were carried out in a field of 75 mT. In this case, the small gap \Delta_{1} is largely suppressed and \rho_{s}^{\rm sSR}(T) is governed by the large gap, leading to a single-band BCS behavior with an energy gap \Delta_{2}. Our analysis suggests that LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is a marginal two-band superconductor, the signatures of the small gap being easily extinguished by magnetic fields due to its weak interband coupling. It should be noted that the band structure of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is more

The solid line is a fit based on the \gamma model; the derived partial superfluid densities \rho_{1}(T) and \rho_{2}(T) are shown by the dashed and dashed-dotted lines, respectively.

  complex than the simplified scenario discussed above, which may explain the difference in the fields required to suppress the small gap in the measurements of field and temperature dependence of the penetration depth. On the other hand, the interband impurity scattering may mix the two bands, which may also lead to single-gap superconducting behavior [31].

It was previously shown that the sister compound, PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, is also a two-gap superconductor with a relatively small admixture of a second gap with reduced \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}[15]. As a comparison, we plotted \rho_{\rm r}^{\rm TDO}(T) of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} in Fig. 4, which show different curvatures near T_{c}. In Fig. 4, we reanalyzed the \rho_{\rm r}^{\rm TDO} of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} in terms of the \gamma model. The best fit gives intraband coupling parameters of \lambda_{11}=0.59 and \lambda_{22}=0.18, which are compatible with those of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}. On the other hand, the fitted interband coupling \lambda_{12}=0.07 is over one order of magnitude larger than that of LaPt_{4}Ge_{1}. The enhanced interband coupling leads to a more robust small energy gap, showing the same type of temperature dependence for the two gaps [15]. For PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, the gap parameters derived from the \gamma model [\Delta_{1}(0)=0.88k_{B}T_{c}, \Delta_{2}(0)=2.17k_{B}T_{c}, and \gamma=0.15] are consistent with those fitted by the \alpha model [15]. These results suggest that the Pr-4f electrons may not play a crucial role in the formation of SC, but enhance the interband coupling in the MPt_{4}Ge_{12} compounds. The latter factor might arise from the local crystal field excitations at the Pr sites in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}. This finding is consistent with the local-density approximation calculations, which show similar electronic structures for the two compounds, where the main contribution of the density of states at the Fermi level is from the Pt and Ge states [7]. Following the same methods used in Ref. [15] for PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, we also fit \rho_{\rm r}^{\rm TDO}(T) of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} with various gap functions (see Fig. 4). It can be seen that all the other models give a poor fit to the experimental data, further supporting the two-gap SC of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}.

Our results may have broader implications for reconciling the diverse behaviors of several multiband superconductors, in particular, those with a weak interband coupling. A number of filled skutterudite superconductors have been considered to be two-band superconductors on the basis of various experiments [5, 6, 32], while in others the data are not convincing [33, 34]. Other similar examples also include V_{3}Si, La_{2}C_{3}, and MgCNi_{3}, where different experimental probes are not yet conclusive on the order parameter symmetry [35]. Focusing on our results, we find that, in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, the smaller gap is subtle and could be easily suppressed by magnetic fields due to the weak interband coupling. To further examine this scenario, it is desirable to study the evolution of the gap structure by tuning the magnetic field or the impurity scattering in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and other superconductors with weak interband coupling.

In summary, we have investigated the superconducting order parameter of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} by measuring the penetration depth and the superfluid density using two different methods. We found that \Delta\lambda_{L}(T) and \rho_{\rm r}^{\rm TDO}(T) from the TDO measurements in the Meissner state can be consistently described by the two-band \gamma model with \Delta_{1}(0)=1.31k_{B}T_{c} and \Delta_{2}(0)=1.80k_{B}T_{c}. The small gap is likely suppressed by the small magnetic field applied in the \muSR experiments. Our results suggest that LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is a two-band superconductor where the critical field for suppressing the small gap is significantly reduced due to the extraordinarily weak interband coupling. The presence of 4f electrons in the Pr-based skutterudite superconductors may enhance the interband coupling and, therefore, give rise to more robust multiband behavior.

###### Abstract

The superconducting pairing state of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is studied by measuring the magnetic penetration depth \lambda(T,B) and superfluid density \rho_{s}(T) using a tunnel-dode-oscillator (TDO)-based method and transverse-field muon-spin rotation (TF-\muSR) spectroscopy. The penetration depth follows an exponential-type temperature dependence at T\ll T_{c}, but increases linearly with magnetic field at T=1.5 K. A detailed analysis demonstrates that both \lambda_{L}(T) and \rho_{T}^{\rm TDO}(T), measured in the Hessner state using the TDO method, are well described by a two-gap \gamma model with gap sizes of \Delta_{1}(0)=1.31k_{B}T_{c} and \Delta_{2}(0)=1.80k_{B}T_{c}, and weak interband coupling. In contrast, \rho_{s}^{\mu\rm SR}(T), derived from the \muSR data, can be fitted by a single-gap BCS model with a gap close to \Delta_{2}(0). We conclude that LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is a marginal two-gap superconductor and the small gap \Delta_{1} seems to be suppressed by a small magnetic field applied in the \muSR experiments. In comparison, the 4 f electrons in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} may enhance the interband coupling and, therefore, give rise to more robust multiband superconductivity.

The discovery of superconductivity (SC) in a series of Pr-based skutterudite compounds, i.e., PrT_{d}X_{12} (T = Fe, Ru, Os, and X = pnictogen), has attracted considerable interest. Despite intensive investigations of the physical properties of these compounds, their superconducting order parameter and, therefore, the pairing mechanism remains highly controversial [1], with evidence for nodal superconductivity in some compounds and conventional BCS SC in others. Even for the same compound, most prominently, the heavy-fermion superconductor PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, the gap symmetry is still under debate. Here, the early measurements provided evidence of point nodes with a possible triplet pairing state [2, 3, 4]. Upon improving the sample homogeneity and measuring to lower temperatures, recent measurements give evidence for multiband SC in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}[5, 6]. Exploration of other filled skutterudite superconductors may help to elucidate the superconducting pairing state and the question of its universality.

A family of Ge-based skutterudites with T_{c} ranging from 5 to 8.3 K, i.e., MPt_{4}Ge_{12} (M = \pi, Ba, La, Pr), was discovered a few years ago [7, 8, 9, 10]. Much as PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, zero-field muon-spin rotation (\muSR) experiments showed evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in the superconducting state of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, but not for LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. However, more recent experiments suggested multigap SC for PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[14, 15, 16]. Furthermore, a coherence peak was observed in the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T_{1} just below T_{c} for PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, which is unexpectedly suppressed in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}[17]. However, the weak variation of T_{c} and of the specific heat jump at T_{c} with the Pr content x in La_{1-x}Pt_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} suggests that the order parameters of the two end members are similar [12]. Thus, LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is not a simple reference compound of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, as seen in many heavy-fermion systems. In order to clarify the superconducting order parameter in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, further investigations are badly needed. Furthermore, a comparative study of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} could shed new light on the role of Pr-4 f electrons in the formation of SC and, therefore, provide a more general picture of the pairing states in skutterudite superconductors.

In this Rapid Communication, we report a comprehensive study of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda(T,B) and superfluid density \rho_{s}(T) of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} using \muSR and a tunnel-diode-oscillator (TDO)-based technique. The London penetration depth \lambda_{L}(T), measured by the TDO method, follows exponential-type behavior in the low-temperature limit, suggesting nodeless SC for LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}. The penetration depth \lambda_{m}(B), determined from the \muSR experiments at T = 1.5 K, follows a linear field dependence, giving evidence for multigap SC. The superfluid density \rho_{s}^{\rm TDO}(T), converted from \lambda_{L}(T), is best described by a two-gap \gamma model, with gap sizes of \Delta_{1}(0)=1.31k_{B}T_{c} and \Delta_{2}(0)=1.80k_{B}T_{c} at T = 0. However, the superfluid density \rho_{s}^{\mu\rm SR}(T) derived from \muSR with a transverse field of 75 mT is fitted by a conventional BCS model with a gap of \Delta(0)\approx\Delta_{2}(0). We argue that marginal two-gap SC exists in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and also some other skutterudite superconductors. Due to very weak interband coupling in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, the small gap may be destroyed by a weak magnetic field (as used in our \muSR measurements) or other perturbations.

Polycrystalline samples of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, as described in Ref. [7], were used for the \muSR experiments, which were performed using the \piM3 beamline at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland) down to temperatures of T=1.5 K on the General Purpose Surface-Muon instrument (GPS) and T\approx 0.02 K on the Low Temperature Facility (LTF) spectrometer.

 The samples were cooled in B_{\rm{app}}=75 mT from above T_{c} down to 1.5 K, and then measured as a function of temperature. At T=1.5 K, we also collected data in several applied magnetic fields. Typical counting statistics were 7-8\times 10^{6} positron events per data point. High quality single crystals of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, grown using multistep thermal treatments [15, 18], were utilized for the London penetration depth study by a TDO-based method. The ac field induced by the coil of the experimental setup was less than 2 \muT, which is much smaller than the lower critical field of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, guaranteeing that the sample was in the Meissner state. Typical sample dimensions were about 0.6\times 0.6\times 0.2 mm^{3}. The change of the London penetration depth \Delta\lambda_{L}(T) is proportional to the frequency shift, i.e., \Delta\lambda_{L}(T)=G\Delta f(T), where G is solely determined by the sample and coil geometries [19].

Figure 1(a) shows the Fourier transforms of the \muSR time spectra P(B) of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} at various temperatures for B_{\rm{app}}=75 mT. Above T_{c}=8.3 K, a narrow and sharp peak is visible in P(B), as is expected for weak nuclear depolarization. Upon lowering the temperature, the peak significantly broadens and becomes asymmetric, in accordance with the field distribution of a well arranged flux-line lattice (FLL). These features point to isotropic SC and weak pinning of the FLL in the polycrystalline samples. In this context, we adopt the exact solution of the Ginzburg-Landau equations following the method suggested by Brandt to analyze the data [20, 21]. The complete analysis of the data follows the procedures described in Ref. [22]. Accordingly, we considered the spatial magnetic field distribution B({\bf r})=B({\bf r},\lambda_{m},\xi,(B)) within the unit cell of the FLL, where \lambda_{m} is the magnetic penetration depth and \xi is the coherence length. The data are well fitted using the theoretical polarization function P(t) given in Ref. [22], as denoted by the solid lines in Fig. 1(a).

The mean value of the superfluid density can be expressed as \rho_{s}^{\mu}{\rm SR}\propto(1-b)/\lambda_{m}^{2}, where b=\langle B\rangle/B_{c2}(0) is the reduced field. In Fig. 1(b), we plot \rho_{s}^{\mu}{\rm SR} derived from the \muSR data as a function of temperature, which can be fitted by the conventional s-wave BCS model with a gap amplitude of \Delta(0)=1.9k_{B}T_{c}. The field dependence of the penetration depth provides an alternative method for probing the low-energy excitations. For nodal or multigap superconductors, the penetration depth \lambda_{m} depends on the applied magnetic field [23], but there is hardly any variation for conventional s-wave superconductors [24]. In the inset of Fig. 1(b) we show the field dependence of \lambda_{m} obtained at 1.5 K for several Pt_{4}Ge_{12}-based superconducting skutterudites. In order to avoid correlation effects between \lambda and \xi, the values of the coherence length \xi were fixed to 15.0, 14.2, 19.7, and 27.0 nm for the La-, Pt-, Sr-, and BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} skutterudites, respectively [25]. These values were obtained from the corresponding upper critical fields B_{c2} at 1.5 K using the Ginzburg-Landau relation B_{c2}=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi[11, 22]. For LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} we used B_{c2}(1.5 K) = 1.48 T [26]. \lambda_{m} of SrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} are independent of the applied field, as expected for s-wave SC with an isotropic gap [see Fig. 1(b)]. In contrast, \lambda_{m} of both LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} displays a linear field dependence with a similar slope, which remarkably resembles that of MgB_{2}[27], a prototype example of a two-band superconductor. Such behavior is compatible with multiband SC, as previously shown for PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[14, 15, 16], but is unexpected for a single-band BCS superconductor.

In order to understand this contradictory behavior, we measured the London penetration depth \Delta\lambda_{L}(T) using the TDO-based method for single-crystalline LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}. A sharp superconducting transition at T_{c}=8.2 K is observed in both the electrical resistivity \rho(T) and specific heat C_{es}(T)/T, as shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). Along with the residual resistivity ratio RRR = 16.3, this confirms the high quality of the LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} crystals. Figure 2(c) presents \Delta\lambda_{L}(T) for two samples from the same batch. The \Delta\lambda_{L}(T) data are well reproducible between the two samples, showing nearly temperature-independent behavior below 1.5 K. This provides further evidence for nodeless SC in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}. According

The inset shows \Delta\lambda_{L}(T) over a wide temperature range. For clarity, the \Delta\lambda_{L}(T) data of sample No. 2 are shifted by 10 Å. The solid lines present a fit of the BCS model to the experimental \Delta\lambda_{L}(T) at T\ll T_{c}.

For reasons of clarity, the data at each temperature were scaled and shifted vertically. The solid lines are fits to the data.

  to the BCS model, the penetration depth at T\ll T_{c} can be expressed by [28]\Delta\lambda(T)\approx\lambda(0)\sqrt{\frac{\pi\lambda(0)}{2k_{B}T}}\exp{(-\frac{ \Delta\lambda(0)}{k_{B}T})}, where \lambda(0) is the penetration depth at T=0. Here, we take the value of \lambda(0)\approx 120 nm from the \muSR results. Usually, the parameter \Delta(0) varies upon changing the fitted temperature range, but becomes saturated at sufficiently low temperatures. The solid lines in Fig. 2(c) represent the best fits to the BCS model in the low-temperature limit, giving \Delta(0)=1.39k_{B}T_{c} for sample No. 1 and \Delta(0)=1.34k_{B}T_{c} for sample No. 2. The fitted \Delta(0) is much smaller than the BCS value of \Delta(0)=1.76k_{B}T_{c}, indicating the appearance of a secondary gap at low temperatures or the anisotropic effect, which is unlikely in a cubic system.

In Fig. 3, we plot the normalized superfluid density \rho_{s}^{\rm TDO}(T)=\lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda_{L}^{2}(T) for LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, which shows an upward curvature near T_{c}. Such behavior may result from the underestimation of \lambda(0). As a comparison, the lower inset of Fig. 3 shows \rho_{s}^{\rm TDO}(T) calculated using different values of \lambda(0). Indeed, the upturn of \rho_{s}^{\rm TDO}(T) weakens with increasing \lambda(0); \rho_{s}^{\rm TDO}(T) resembles the \muSR data for \lambda(0)=250 nm, but still shows a clear deviation near T_{c}. It is noted that our samples have a regular geometry and the total uncertainties from the \lambda(0) value and the G factor in the TDO measurements should be limited to about 20%. Thus, such a large enhancement of \lambda(0) is also far beyond the uncertainties from our experiments. On the other hand, similar concave behavior was previously observed in some multiband superconductors with weak interband coupling [29]. Considering the fact that LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} possesses multiple Fermi surface sheets [7], it is reasonable to analyze \rho_{s}^{\rm TDO}(T) in terms of multiband SC.

According to the \gamma model [29], which applies generally to clean two-band superconductors, the total superfluid density can be written as \rho_{s}(T)=\gamma\rho_{1}[\Delta_{1}(0),T]+(1-\gamma)\rho_{2}[\Delta_{2}(0),T], where \gamma is the relative weight of the contribution from the gap \Delta_{1}. For a two-band system with known density of states n_{\mu} and Fermi velocities \nu_{u} (\mu=1,2), \gamma is determined by \gamma=n_{1}\langle v_{1}^{2}\rangle/(n_{1}\langle v_{1}^{2}\rangle+n_{2} \langle v_{2}^{2}\rangle). Here, \langle v_{\mu}^{2}\rangle represents the average of the squared Fermi velocities over the corresponding band. According to the electronic structure calculations [7], several energy bands cross the Fermi energy in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}. As an approximation, we group the major energy bands into two effective bands according to the values of Fermi velocity in each band, which gives n_{1}=0.12, n_{2}=0.88, and \nu_{1}/\nu_{2}\sim 2.3. Thus, a value of \gamma=0.42 is estimated. The partial superfluid density \rho_{\mu} and the energy gap \Delta_{\mu} are calculated self-consistently using the quasiclassic Eilenberger equations. Following the method described in Ref. [29], we fitted the experimental \rho_{s}^{\rm TDO}(T) with fitting parameters of \gamma and \lambda_{\mu\nu}, where \lambda_{\mu\nu} are the interband and intraband pairing couplings. The best-fit results, with \lambda_{11}=0.63,\lambda_{12}=0.0025, and \lambda_{22}=0.20, are shown in Fig. 3, which overlaps nicely with the experimental data. The derived values of n_{1}=0.23 and \gamma=0.4 are compatible with those estimated directly from the band structure calculations. Such a fit gives \Delta_{1}(0)=1.31k_{B}T_{c} and \Delta_{2}(0)=1.80k_{B}T_{c}; the small gap \Delta_{1}(0) agrees well with that obtained from the exponential fits of \Delta\lambda_{L}(T) at T\ll T_{c}, where \Delta(0)=1.39k_{B}T_{c}. As shown in the upper inset of Fig. 3, \Delta_{1}(T) exhibits non-BCS behavior, the rapid vanishing of \Delta_{1}(T) leads to the upturn in \rho_{s}^{\rm TDO}(T) near T_{c}.

Remarkably, the calculated partial superfluid density \rho_{2}(T) is nearly identical to \rho_{\mu}^{\rm sSR}(T) (see Fig. 3). Such an agreement suggests that the small energy gap is likely destroyed by the small magnetic field applied in the \muSR experiments. In a two-band superconductor with a vanishing \lambda_{12}, it was theoretically shown that the small gap may be suppressed at a largely reduced effective upper critical field [30]. The so-called "virtual" upper critical field B_{c2}^{*}, above which the vortex cores overlap and thus drive the majority of the electrons in the associated band normal, can be estimated by B_{c2}^{*}(0)\sim B_{c2}\langle 0|\lambda_{1}(0)v_{2}/\Delta_{2}(0)\nu_{1}|^{2}. For LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, a value of B_{c2}^{*}(0)\sim 150 mT is estimated by using the parameters derived above and B_{c2}(0)=1.6 T [26]. The small B_{c2}^{*}(0) may account for the discrepancy between \rho_{s}(T) determined from the TDO and \muSR experiments. In the TDO measurements, the sample is in the Meissner state, which allows us to detect both the large and the small gaps. On the other hand, the transverse-field muon-spin rotation (TF-\muSR) measurements were carried out in a field of 75 mT. In this case, the small gap \Delta_{1} is largely suppressed and \rho_{s}^{\rm sSR}(T) is governed by the large gap, leading to a single-band BCS behavior with an energy gap \Delta_{2}. Our analysis suggests that LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is a marginal two-band superconductor, the signatures of the small gap being easily extinguished by magnetic fields due to its weak interband coupling. It should be noted that the band structure of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is more

The solid line is a fit based on the \gamma model; the derived partial superfluid densities \rho_{1}(T) and \rho_{2}(T) are shown by the dashed and dashed-dotted lines, respectively.

  complex than the simplified scenario discussed above, which may explain the difference in the fields required to suppress the small gap in the measurements of field and temperature dependence of the penetration depth. On the other hand, the interband impurity scattering may mix the two bands, which may also lead to single-gap superconducting behavior [31].

It was previously shown that the sister compound, PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, is also a two-gap superconductor with a relatively small admixture of a second gap with reduced \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}[15]. As a comparison, we plotted \rho_{\rm r}^{\rm TDO}(T) of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} in Fig. 4, which show different curvatures near T_{c}. In Fig. 4, we reanalyzed the \rho_{\rm r}^{\rm TDO} of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} in terms of the \gamma model. The best fit gives intraband coupling parameters of \lambda_{11}=0.59 and \lambda_{22}=0.18, which are compatible with those of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}. On the other hand, the fitted interband coupling \lambda_{12}=0.07 is over one order of magnitude larger than that of LaPt_{4}Ge_{1}. The enhanced interband coupling leads to a more robust small energy gap, showing the same type of temperature dependence for the two gaps [15]. For PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, the gap parameters derived from the \gamma model [\Delta_{1}(0)=0.88k_{B}T_{c}, \Delta_{2}(0)=2.17k_{B}T_{c}, and \gamma=0.15] are consistent with those fitted by the \alpha model [15]. These results suggest that the Pr-4f electrons may not play a crucial role in the formation of SC, but enhance the interband coupling in the MPt_{4}Ge_{12} compounds. The latter factor might arise from the local crystal field excitations at the Pr sites in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}. This finding is consistent with the local-density approximation calculations, which show similar electronic structures for the two compounds, where the main contribution of the density of states at the Fermi level is from the Pt and Ge states [7]. Following the same methods used in Ref. [15] for PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, we also fit \rho_{\rm r}^{\rm TDO}(T) of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} with various gap functions (see Fig. 4). It can be seen that all the other models give a poor fit to the experimental data, further supporting the two-gap SC of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}.

Our results may have broader implications for reconciling the diverse behaviors of several multiband superconductors, in particular, those with a weak interband coupling. A number of filled skutterudite superconductors have been considered to be two-band superconductors on the basis of various experiments [5, 6, 32], while in others the data are not convincing [33, 34]. Other similar examples also include V_{3}Si, La_{2}C_{3}, and MgCNi_{3}, where different experimental probes are not yet conclusive on the order parameter symmetry [35]. Focusing on our results, we find that, in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, the smaller gap is subtle and could be easily suppressed by magnetic fields due to the weak interband coupling. To further examine this scenario, it is desirable to study the evolution of the gap structure by tuning the magnetic field or the impurity scattering in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and other superconductors with weak interband coupling.

In summary, we have investigated the superconducting order parameter of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} by measuring the penetration depth and the superfluid density using two different methods. We found that \Delta\lambda_{L}(T) and \rho_{\rm r}^{\rm TDO}(T) from the TDO measurements in the Meissner state can be consistently described by the two-band \gamma model with \Delta_{1}(0)=1.31k_{B}T_{c} and \Delta_{2}(0)=1.80k_{B}T_{c}. The small gap is likely suppressed by the small magnetic field applied in the \muSR experiments. Our results suggest that LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is a two-band superconductor where the critical field for suppressing the small gap is significantly reduced due to the extraordinarily weak interband coupling. The presence of 4f electrons in the Pr-based skutterudite superconductors may enhance the interband coupling and, therefore, give rise to more robust multiband behavior.

Figure 4: (Color online) The normalized superfluid density \rho_{\rm r}^{\rm TDO}(T) for LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}. The symbols and solid lines represent the experimental data and their corresponding fits using the two-band \gamma model. For comparison, we also fit \rho_{\rm r}^{\rm TDO}(T) of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, using various gap functions allowed by the crystal symmetry [15].
