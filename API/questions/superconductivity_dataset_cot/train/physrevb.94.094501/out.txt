###### Abstract

Electrical resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements were performed on polycrystalline samples of the filled-skutterudite systems La_{1-x}_M_{x}_Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (_M_ = Ce and Th). Superconductivity in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} was quickly suppressed with Ce substitution and no evidence for superconductivity was found down to 1.1 K for x > 0.2. Temperature-dependent specific heat data at low temperatures for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} show a change from power-law to exponential behavior, which may be an indication for multiband superconductivity in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}. A similar crossover was observed in the Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} system. However, the suppression rates of the superconducting transition temperatures _T_{c}_(_x_) in the two systems are quite disparate, indicating a difference in the nature of superconductivity, which is conventional in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and unconventional in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}. In comparison, a nearly linear and smooth evolution of _T_{c}_ with increasing Th was observed in the La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} system, with no change of the superconducting energy gap in the temperature dependence of the specific heat, suggesting similar types of superconductivity in both the LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} compounds.

## 1 Introduction

Recently, a new branch of filled skutterudites was discovered with the chemical formula _A_Pt_{4}Ge_{12}[1, 2]. Several members of this branch were found to exhibit superconductivity with A = La and Pr exhibiting the highest superconducting transition temperatures, _T_{c}_\sim 8 K [1, 2, 3]. Considerable attention has been focused on PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} as it exhibits signs of unconventional superconductivity [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. However, investigations into SrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} show that the superconductivity is conventional BCS-type which originates from, and is intrinsic to, the Pt-Ge cages [1]. Furthermore, LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} was also found to exhibit evidence for conventional BCS-type superconductivity from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ^{73}Ge nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements [11, 12].

The compound CePt_{4}Ge_{12} is thought to lie on the border between an intermediate-valence (IV) and a Kondo lattice compound [11]. Initial investigations into CePt_{4}Ge_{12} revealed a broad maximum in the magnetization _M_(_T_), which can be a characteristic of intermediate-valence compounds. However, high-resolution x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements indicated that the Ce ions exhibit a temperature-independent valence close to \sim3^{+}[13]. Recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements find a wider quasielastic peak at higher energies, consistent with an IV system, as well as the absence of crystalline electric field effects expected in a Kondo system [14].

Therefore we decided to investigate the La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} system to complement our previous study of the Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} system. We anticipated that these two investigations could provide valuable insight into the nature of superconductivity in the Pt-Ge based filled skutterudites. Additionally, studies of ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} have uncovered signatures of an exotic form of superconductivity from \muSR measurements [15], power-law contributions to specific heat [16], and a complex Fermi surface from band-structure calculations [17]; these results motivated a parallel study on the system La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}.

We found that _T_{c}_ in La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is suppressed rapidly and almost linearly with increasing x, with the onset of superconductivity no longer being observable down to 1.1 K for x > 0.2. In contrast, the onset of superconductivity in Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} persists up to x = 0.5, and the _T_{c}_ versus x curve has pronounced positive curvature [9]. In the La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} system, we observed a smooth and continuous change in _T_{c}_ versus x, which is inconsistent with the behavior that would be expected for the existence of different types of superconducting states [18, 19]; i.e., the continuous and smooth behavior of _T_{c}_ versus x instead suggests that both LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} exhibit the same type of superconductivity.

A change in the temperature dependence of the specific heat in the superconducting state of La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is observed; this may be evidence for a crossover from multiband superconductivity in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} to isotropic single-band superconductivity in the x > 0 samples. A similar crossover in the specific heat behavior was observed when Ce was substituted into PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, a material with well-established evidence for multiband superconductivity [6, 7, 8, 9]. Specific heat measurements on the system La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} from x = 0 to x = 0.2 did not exhibit a similar change. Taken together with previous studies, it is possible that both LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} are multiband superconductors.

## 2 Experimental Details

Polycrystalline samples of La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (_x_ = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.80, 1) and La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (_x_ = 0,  0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) were synthesized in an atmosphere of ultrahigh-purity argon by arc-melting in a custom built arc furnace employing a zirconium getter on a water-cooled copper hearth. The starting materials were La ingots (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%), Ce rods (Alfa Aesar 3N, EPSI 99.9%), Th pieces, Pt sponge arc-melted into spheres (99.9999+%), and Ge pieces (Alfa Aesar 99.9999+%). The starting materials were weighed out in the molar stochiometric ratios, arc-melted together, and then flipped over and arc-melted again four more times to promote homogeneity. All samples were heat treated in a sealed quartz tube under an inert atmosphere (200 torr Ar) for 336 hours at 800 degC.

Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a Bruker D8 x-ray diffractometer with a Cu K_{a} source. Four-wire electrical resistivity measurements were performed from 300 K down to \sim1.1 K in a pumped ^{4}He Dewar. Magnetization measurements were performed between 300 and 2 K in a Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS) equipped with a 7-T superconducting magnet. Specific heat measurements were performed down to 1.8 K using a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) DynaCool. The heat capacity measurements employed a standard thermal relaxation technique.

## III Results

Rietveld refinements were performed on the powder XRD patterns for each sample using GSAS [20] and EXPGUI [21]. Displayed in Fig. 1(a) is an XRD pattern for La0.4Ce0.6Pt4Ge12, representative of the XRD patterns observed for values of x throughout both the La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 and La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12 systems. The blue line is the experimental XRD pattern and the red tick marks below locate the 2Th positions of the expected Bragg reflections for the refined filled-skutterudite crystal structure. The cubic filled-skutterudite crystal structure (space group _Im_\overline{3}) was observed over the entire range of x for both series. As is commonly observed in the Pt-Ge based skutterudites [2,7,8,11,14,22,23], small impurity phases of Ge and/or PtGe2 (at most up to \sim5% by mass) were detected in the samples. Figures 1(b) and 1(c) display the lattice parameter a for La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 (blue circles) and La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12 (teal pentagons) with dashed lines serving as guides to the eye. The system La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12 exhibits a linear decrease of a as x increases with the end members exhibiting a values of 8.618 A for x = 0 and 8.615 A for x = 1. The plot of a versus x for La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 shows a sudden increase in a of about 0.3% at x = 1. This may be because the XRD measurements for the sample with x = 1 were made using a different x-ray diffractometer. Another possible explanation for the larger a value for the sample with x = 1 is that there is a known sample dependence in the Pt-Ge based filled skutterudites; reported values for a of _M_Pt4Ge12 (_M_ = La, Pr, Nd, Ce) differ by roughly 0.5% [2,11].

The electrical resistivity _r_(_T_), measured in zero applied magnetic field, is displayed for the series La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 in Fig. 2(a) and La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12 in Fig. 2(b). The system La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 exhibits an overall increase in _r_(_T_) with increasing x, except for x = 1 at low temperature, which exhibits a large decrease below 150 K. The overall shape of _r_(_T_) exhibits the behavior of a simple metal, while at higher temperature, it has a negative curvature. This type of _r_(_T_) behavior is often observed in the Ce-based filled skutterudites such as CeFe4Sb12[24]. However, for La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12, _r_(_T_) does not exhibit any clear trend with increasing x, possibly due to uncertainties in the measurement of the geometrical factors of the resistivity samples. Plotted in Fig. 2(c) are the scaled _r_(_T_) data for the system La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 such that the slopes, _d_r_/_dT_, are identical to _d_r_/_dT_ for LaPt4Ge12 at high temperature. The scaled _r_(_T_) data clearly show that additional electron scattering associated with the 4f electrons is introduced by Ce substitution. In contrast, when the same procedure is performed on the _r_(_T_) data for La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12, displayed in Fig. 2(d), the scaled _r_(_T_) data collapse onto a single curve, suggesting that Th substitution does not introduce any additional mechanisms for scattering electrons. The intrinsic differences in the _r_(_T_) curves in Fig. 2(b) are due to differences in lattice scattering (electron-phonon scattering depends on the Debye temperature, _r_D = 220 K [13], in the Bloch-Gruneisen formula), and the nonmonotonic trend of the unscaled r at 300 K may be a consequence of errors in estimating the geometrical factor for the x = 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 samples.

For the La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 and La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12 series, the _r_(_T_) data are well described by _r_(_T_) = r00 + _AT_2 up to ~250 K2 in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d), indicating that both systems exhibit Fermi liquid behavior. A is a fitting parameter and r0 is the residual resistivity. The insets in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) plot the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) as a function of x for La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 and La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12, respectively, where the RRR is defined as r000/_r_0, where r00 is the value of r at 300 K. The RRR versus x exhibits a parabolic shape with the minimum at x = 0.6 for both La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 (RRR = 3)

Black asterisks indicate Bragg reflections associated with a Ge/PtGe2 impurity phase. The lattice parameter, _α_, is plotted for La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 in (b) and for La1−xTh,Pt4Ge12 in (c). The dashed lines are guides to the eye. The _α_ versus x data for both La1−xCe,Pt4Ge12 and La1−xTh,Pt4Ge12 obey Vegard’s law, except for x = 1, in La1−xCe,Pt4Ge12, where _α_ has a larger value (see text). The _α_ values for LaPt4Ge12, CePt4Ge12, and ThPt4Ge12 are plotted for comparison.

  and La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (RRR = 10), close to the predicted minimum for simple alloys at x=0.5.

There are clear drops in \rho(T) at T_{c}. To determine T_{c}, the ratio \rho(T)/\rho_{10}, where \rho_{10} is \rho(T=10 K) (a representative value of \rho(T) in the normal state) was plotted versus T in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} and La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, respectively. T_{c} was defined as the temperature where \rho(T)/\rho_{10}=0.5 and the width of the transition was characterized by the temperatures where \rho(T)/\rho_{10}=0.9 and 0.1. For La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, T_{c} is rapidly suppressed with increasing x, with only the onset of superconductivity observed for x=0.2 from measurements down to 1.1 K. In the system La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, T_{c} is also suppressed with increasing x, from 8.3 K for x=0 down to 4.5 K for x=1. Th substitution suppresses T_{c} less rapidly than Ce substitution; however, this is not surprising since its 5f electron shell is empty so that Th is nonmagnetic and ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} exhibits superconductivity. In contrast, CePt_{4}Ge_{12} exhibits no ordered state down to 50 mK [11, 13, 25].

Magnetization divided by magnetic field, M/H, versus T data for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} are shown in Fig. 4(a) where the M(T)/H data were scaled by a factor of 1000 for clarity. M(T)/H exhibits Curie-Weiss behavior above 200 K for all x and passes through a broad maximum around 80 K, followed by an upturn as T\to 0 K. The deviations from Curie-Weiss behavior, manifested by the broad maxima, could be an indication of either intermediate-valence (IV) behavior of Ce or Kondo lattice behavior [2]. The broad maxima become smaller in amplitude and width as the peak position shifts to lower temperatures with decreasing x, as seen in Fig. 4(c). This behavior may suggest that the local Kondo temperature, T_{K}, also decreases with decreasing x and that the 4f electrons are well localized at high temperatures. If T_{K} arises from the fully trivalent Ce^{3+}, then La substitution would weaken the Ce-Ce interactions, which would suppress the broad maxima as well as T_{K}. However, it should be noted that this behavior differs from that observed for La substitution into the compound CeRu_{4}Sb_{12}, where the broad maximum in M(T) does not shift in temperature with increasing La concentration [26]. The small upturns in M(T)/H as T\to 0 K do not scale with x, making the upturns more likely due to small amounts of paramagnetic impurities, as described in previous literature [9, 10, 27], instead of being a signature of non-Fermi liquid behavior [28]. Both \chi_{300}, M(T)/H at

The superconducting critical temperature T_{c}, where T_{c} is defined as \rho(T)/\rho_{10}=0.5, for both systems decreases with increasing x. Measurements down to 1.1 K reveal that the onset of superconductivity is observable up to x=0.2 for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. The T_{c} for La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} decreases almost linearly with x, with the lowest value of T_{c}=4.5 K observed for x=1.0, close to the reported value [16, 15]. Selected \rho versus T^{2} data for (c) La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} and (d) La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} with offsets for visual clarity. Linear fits of \rho(T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{2} were performed up to roughly 250 K^{2}.

The inset displays the residual resistivity ratio RRR (\rho_{100}/\rho_{0}) versus x for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (blue circles for this work), plotted as a function of x. The ratio exhibits a parabolic behavior with a minimum RRR = 3 for x=0.6. (b) \rho versus T for La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} which tends to exhibit an overall decrease of \rho with increasing x. The RRR versus x is displayed in the inset for La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (purple squares) with the minimum RRR = 10 at x=0.6, similar to the parabolic behavior observed in La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}.

  300 K, and \chi_{0}, M(T)/H as T\to 0 K, are enhanced with increasing x, \chi_{300} increases from \sim0 cm^{3}/mol for x=0 to 2.3\times 10^{-3} cm^{3}/mol for x=1. \chi_{0} was determined by extrapolating M(T)/H as T\to 0 K from data at temperatures above those where the broad upturns are observed. As can be seen in Fig. 4(b), \chi_{0} increases with increasing x, exhibiting an almost tenfold increase from \chi_{0}=0.39\times 10^{-3} cm^{3}/mol for x=0 up to \chi_{0}=3.69\times 10^{-3} cm^{3}/mol for x=1.

Curie-Weiss law fits were performed on the M(T)/H data between 200 and 300 K for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}; this temperature range was used because the broad maxima in M(T)/H made fitting to lower temperatures inappropriate. The effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff} and Curie-Weiss temperature \theta_{CW} for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} were determined using the relation M(T)/H=C_{0}/(T-\theta_{CW}), where C_{0}=\mu_{\rm eff}^{2}N_{A}/3k_{B}, N_{A} is Avagadro's number and k_{B} is Boltzmann's constant. The values we obtained for \mu_{\rm eff} and \theta_{CW} are plotted in Figs. 4(d) and 4(e), respectively. \mu_{\rm eff}=2.67\mu_{B}/Ce for x=1, which is slightly larger than the predicted value of 2.54 \mu_{B} for the Ce^{3+} electronic configuration using Hund's rules; the limited temperature range for the Curie-Weiss fits, caused by the broad maximum, is possibly responsible for the disparity between the measured and calculated \mu_{\rm eff} values. The effective moment \mu_{\rm eff} increases slowly with decreasing x and exhibits values close to the free ion values derived from Hund's rules, reaching 3.16 \mu_{B}/Ce for x=0.2. The Curie-Weiss temperature \theta_{CW}=-83 K of CePt_{4}Ge_{12} has a magnitude about twice as large as the value originally reported (\theta_{CW}=-39.2 K) [13], and within the scatter of the data, remains nearly constant with a value of -80 K throughout the entire series.

M(T)/H measurements were performed for La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} samples in an applied magnetic field H=10 Oe to determine T_{c} and the superconducting volume fraction, v, as can be seen in Fig. 5. The superconducting volume fraction, v, was estimated using the equation M(T)/H\times d=v, where M(T)/H is in units of emu/mol and d is the molar density of the compound in units of mol/cm^{3}. T_{c} for LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is 8 K, and it is suppressed with increasing x down to 4.3 K for x=1, consistent with reported literature for the end-member compounds [2,3]. The volume fraction, v, is consistently near -1 for all x. This is evidence that the sample completely expels magnetic fields and is consistent with bulk superconductivity.

Specific heat divided by temperature C(T)/T versus T plots for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (x=0, 0.05, and 0.1) and for La_{0.8}Th_{0.2}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} are displayed in Fig. 6(a). T_{c} was determined from idealized equal entropy conserving constructions about the specific heat jump associated with superconductivity as seen for La_{0.95}Ce_{0.05}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} in the inset of Fig. 6(a). In La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, T_{c} was rapidly suppressed with increasing x: from T_{c}=8.3 K for x=0 down to T_{c}=3.2 K for x=0.1. For La_{0.8}Th_{0.2}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, only a small decrease in T_{c} was observed, shifting down to T_{c}=7.3 K.

Linear fits using the equation C(T)/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2} were performed on the specific heat data from the lowest temperature in the normal state up to temperatures as high as linear fits were possible to determine the Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma and Debye temperature \Theta_{D}. The coefficient of the phonon contribution to the specific heat \beta is related to \Theta_{D} by the relation \Theta_{D}=[1944\times(n/\beta)]^{1/3} K, where n=17 is the number of atoms in the formula unit. The electronic contribution to specific heat \gamma exhibits a moderate increase with initial Ce substitution where \gamma=50 mJ/mol K^{2} for x=0

Figure 4: (a) Magnetization divided by applied magnetic field, M/H, versus T from 300 K down to 2 K for the La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} system. The magnetic susceptibility, \chi(T)=M(T)/H, increases with increasing x, exhibiting an almost tenfold increase between x=0 and 1. (b) The low-temperature magnetic susceptibility \chi_{0}, plotted as a function of x. \chi_{0} was determined by extrapolating M(T)/H data to T\to 0 K while ignoring the small upturns observed at the lowest temperatures; these were determined to be due to small amounts of paramagnetic impurities. (c) T^{*}, the temperature where the broad maximum in the M/H versus T data is centered as indicated by the black arrows in (a), plotted versus x. The local maximum is possible evidence for either intermediate valence Ce or Kondo lattice behavior. T^{*} shifts to higher temperatures with increasing x, up to 80 K at x=1, consistent with reported literature for CePt_{4}Ge_{12}[11]. The effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff} and Curie-Weiss temperature \theta_{\rm CE} were determined from Curie-Weiss fits performed on the inverse M/H data in the temperature range 200–300 K and are plotted versus x in (d) and (e), respectively.

Figure 5: Magnetization divided by magnetic field plotted as 4\pi\,M/H versus T for La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} from 2–10 K in an external magnetic field H=10 Oe. The superconducting critical temperature T_{c} decreases as x increases, from 8 K for x=0 down to 4.3 K for x=1. The nearly unity value of |4\pi\,M/H| is evidence for bulk superconductivity throughout the La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} series.

  and reaches 80 mJ/mol K^{2} for x=0.1, close to the reported values of \gamma\sim 100 mJ/mol K^{2} for CePt_{4}Ge_{12}[9, 13]. Thorium substitution results in a slight suppression of \gamma, where \gamma=30 mJ/mol K^{2} for La_{0.8}Th_{0.2}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, as shown in Fig. 6(b). \Theta_{D} appears to be insensitive to Ce or Th substitution, fluctuating less than 5% from \Theta_{D}=204 K for x=0, as seen in Fig. 6(c).

Interestingly, negative curvature was observed in the C/T versus T^{2} data as T\to 0 K for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} with x\geqslant 0.05. To investigate this behavior, the electronic contribution to the specific heat C_{c}(T) was determined by subtracting the phonon contribution from C(T)/T and plotting as \log(C_{e}(T)/\gamma T_{c}) versus T_{c}/T in Fig. 7(a) for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} and (b) for La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. The data sets were offset for clarity. The solid lines represent fits to each data set. For La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, C_{e}(T) for the samples with x=0.05 and 0.1 is well described by an exponential temperature dependence of the form be^{-(\Delta/T)}, where b is a fitting parameter and \Delta represents the superconducting energy gap. Best fit values for b were roughly 9.8 and 7.3 for x=0.05 and 0.1, respectively. The best fit values were \Delta/T_{c}=1.52 and 1.38 for x=0.05 and 0.1, respectively; while the values of \Delta/T_{c} could vary depending on the fitting range [30], the exponential behavior is still evidence for BCS superconductivity. Attempts to fit C_{e}(T) data for x=0 with the function be^{-(\Delta/T)} were unsuccessful. However, fits using a power-law function of the form cT^{n}, where c is a fitting parameter, were found to describe C_{e}(T) versus T for x=0 very well, where n=2.5. The change from cT^{n} to be^{-(\Delta/T)} temperature dependencies may be explained by a transition from a multiband superconductor to a single-band isotropic s-wave superconductor. C_{e}(T)\sim T^{n} behavior is also expected for superconductors with nodes in the energy gap with n=2 for line nodes and n=3 for point nodes [29], while C(T)\sim e^{-(\Delta/T)} behavior is expected for single-band isotropic s-wave superconductors. It should be noted that this type of analysis based on the temperature-dependence of the specific heat is believed to be valid at low temperatures (i.e., T\ll T_{c}) [29, 30]. However, our results, including the change of the temperature-dependence of the specific heat and the rapid initial suppression of T_{c}, are quite similar to those observed in the Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} system [9]; this matter has been further investigated by a recent study of the low-temperature specific heat, confirming a crossover in the superconducting gap structure [31]. Combining these factors, we believe that the change in the temperature-dependence of the specific heat is very likely intrinsic to La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. Noninteger values of n can be due to the contributions to specific heat from multiple superconducting gaps, as was observed in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[8]. Our results suggest that multiband superconductivity may also occur in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} as C(T) for this compound varies as T^{2.5} for T<T_{c}, which is consistent with a recent tunnel-diode-oscillator (TDO) and transverse-field muon-spin rotaion (TF-\muSR) spectroscopy measurements on LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, suggesting marginal two-gap superconductivity in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}[32]. A noninteger value of n for Ce substitution may indicate that the system has been driven to single-band conventional superconductivity. The cT^{n} behavior of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} was preserved with n=2.4 for La_{0.8}Th_{0.2}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}.

## IV Discussion

The T_{c} versus x curve for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (blue symbols), derived from \rho(T), M(T)/H, and C(T), is shown in Fig. 8. Dashed lines in the figure are guides to the eye. The T_{c} versus x curve for Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (red symbols) reported in Ref. [9] is also shown for comparison. Displayed in the inset is the T_{c} versus x curve for La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. In La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, the

The superconducting critical temperature T_{c} is suppressed with increasing x, with Ce substitution having a more pronounced effect than Th substitution. T_{c} values were determined from idealized equal entropy constructions fitted to the electronic contribution to specific heat, C_{e}/T, as shown in the inset for La_{0.95}Ce_{0.09}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. Linear fits were performed on the C/T data plotted versus T^{2} in the lowest-temperature regions in the normal state to determine the Sommerfeld efficient \gamma and the Debye temperature \Theta_{D}; these quantities are plotted in (b) and (c), respectively.

Figure 7: (a) and (b) The electronic contribution to specific heat plotted as \log(C_{e}/T\,T_{c}) versus T_{c}/T for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} and La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, respectively. The data sets were offset for clarity. For the La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} samples, the specific heat data are well described by an exponential temperature dependence of the form e^{-\Delta/T}, which is the expected behavior for an isotropic superconducting energy gap. However, the LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and La_{0.8}Th_{0.2}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} data exhibit a power-law T^{n} temperature dependence, where n\sim 2.5. This result may be consistent with multiband superconductivity.

  initial rate of suppression of T_{c}, (dT_{c}/dx)_{x=0}=-0.4 K/at. % Ce, is much larger in magnitude than (dT_{c}/dx)_{x=0}=-0.04 K/at. % Th for La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. Because of the positive curvature of T_{c} versus x in Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, we were only able to approximate (dT_{c}/dx)_{x=0} for x\leq 0.1 which yields (dT_{c}/dx)_{x=0}\sim-0.4 K/at. % Ce, close to the value obtained for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. The series La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} was found to exhibit a rapid and almost linear suppression of T_{c} with increasing Ce concentration, which extrapolated to 0 K near x\approx 0.2. While Ce substitution at low x produces a similar depression of T_{c} for both La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} and Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, at higher Ce concentrations, the T_{c} versus x curve for Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} develops strong positive curvature and appears to extrapolate to 0 K at x\approx 0.4, roughly twice the value of x where T_{c} vanishes for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}.

The T_{c} versus x curves for the Ln_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (Ln= La and Pr) systems shown in Fig. 8 reveal that the rate of depression of T_{c} with Ce concentration is similar for the two systems, both of which have values of T_{c}\approx 8 K at x=0, for x\lesssim 0.1, and is significantly weaker for Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} than La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} for 0.1\lesssim x\lesssim 0.2. This reveals that the Ce substituents produce stronger superconducting electron pair breaking in the LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} compound, in which the electronic correlations are relatively weak and the superconductivity is conventional [11, 12], than in the PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} compound, where the electronic correlations are stronger and the superconductivity is unconventional (e.g., superconductivity breaks time-reversal symmetry) [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Since the CePt_{4}Ge_{12} end member compound is also a correlated electron system [11], the electronic correlations associated with the Ce solutes apparently have a stronger pair breaking effect on the conventional superconductivity exhibited by the LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} parent compound than on the unconventional superconductivity displayed by the PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} parent compound. The shapes of the T_{c} versus x curves for the Ln_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (Ln= La and Pr) systems are reminiscent of metallic host metals that exhibit conventional superconductivity containing transition metal, lanthanide, and actinide solute ions with partially-filled d- or f-electron shells in which the normal ground state at superconducting temperatures is nonmagnetic [33]. In these systems, a characteristic temperature T_{0} associated with spin fluctuations, valence fluctuations, or the Kondo effect separates high-temperature local moment behavior, characterized by a Curie-Weiss law, and low-temperature nonmagnetic behavior, reflected in a magnetic susceptibility that approaches a finite value as T\to 0 K. When T_{0} is much larger than the T_{c} of the superconducting host metal (T_{c0}), the initial rate of depression of T_{c} can be quite large and have pronounced positive curvature, similar to that observed for Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. This behavior is well established, and exemplary systems in which it has been observed include the Al_{1-x}Mn_{x}[34], Th_{1-x}Ce_{x}[35], and Th_{1-x}U_{x}[36] systems, where the Al and Th host metals are conventional superconductors. If one assumes that the temperature at which the magnetic susceptibility of the Ln_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (Ln= La and Pr) samples attains a maximum value is of the order of the characteristic temperature T_{0}, then these systems are in the limit that T_{0}\gg T_{c0} (e.g., T_{0}\sim 50-100 K for both the La- and Pr-based systems). It is tempting to compare the T_{c} versus x data with theories of superconductivity in host-impurity systems that display the Kondo effect, such as the theory of Muller-Hartmann and Zittartz [37]. However, these theories are based on the host metal being a simple one-band conventional BCS superconductor and for noninteracting paramagnetic impurities. The Ln_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (Ln=La and Pr) compounds have complex Fermi surfaces with multiple sheets that apparently lead to multiband superconductivity [6, 7, 8, 9], large Ce solute concentrations in which the interactions between Ce ions increase with Ce concentration, and conventional superconductivity displayed by the La-based compound [11, 12] and unconventional superconductivity exhibited by the Pr-based compound [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

Previous studies show that C(T) for ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} exhibits a T^{3} temperature dependence for T<T_{c}, which may suggest that there are point nodes in the superconducting energy gap [16]. If this interpretation is correct, the superconductivity exhibited by ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} could be unconventional. Therefore chemical substitution between ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} and LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, might be expected to result in a pronounced minimum in T_{c}(x) due to competing superconducting phases as was observed in studies of the filled skutterudite system PrOs_{4-x}Ru_{x}Sb_{12}[18, 19, 38]. Instead, we observe a smooth and continuous T_{c} versus x curve for La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, showing no evidence for competing superconducting phases. One possible explanation for this behavior is that both LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} may be multiband superconductors, with each band exhibiting conventional BCS superconductivity. Band-structure calculations demonstrate that ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} exhibits multiple Fermi surface sheets, which is a requirement

[9]). The dashed lines are guides to the eye. The suppression of T_{c} with increasing x for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is greater than in Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. Whereas the T_{c} versus x curve for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is nearly linear, the T_{c} versus x curve for Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} exhibits positive curvature. Shown in the inset is the T_{c} versus x curve for La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (purple squares). The response of T_{c} with increasing x is smooth and continuous. The reported T_{c} values for LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} (Ref. [13]) and ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} (Ref. [3]) are added as a red circle and blue triangle for reference.

  for multiband superconductivity [17]. Additionally, the T^{3} temperature-dependence of the specific heat was used to suggest point nodes in the energy gap; however, the power-law temperature dependence of C(T) can also be evidence of multiband superconductivity, as was suggested for PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[8]. With respect to LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, band-structure calculations also predict multiband crossings at the Fermi energy, E_{F}[6]. When we combine this with the results from the present study, which show that the specific heat of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} displays a power-law temperature-dependence in the superconducting state and that the response of superconductivity in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} to Ce substitution is similar to that in the potential multiband superconductor PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[6, 7, 8, 9], there is mounting evidence for multiband superconductivity in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}. The apparent similarity of the superconducting states of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} reinforces this possibility. However, further work will be necessary to definitively address the nature of the superconducting energy gap(s) in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}[29, 39].

## V Concluding remarks

The La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} and La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} systems were studied by means of electrical resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements. The broad maxima in the \chi(T) data for CePt_{4}Ge_{12} were suppressed with increasing La concentrations, both in temperature and amplitude, which may be due to weakening of the Ce-Ce interactions with increasing La concentration. Superconductivity in the La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} system was rapidly suppressed with increasing Ce concentration, with no evidence for superconductivity down to 1.1 K for x>0.2. The suppression of T_{c} in La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is significantly more rapid than previously observed in Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, supporting an interpretation that the superconductivity observed in these two systems is different in nature. Specific heat measurements in the superconducting state of La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} revealed a change from a power law to exponential temperature dependence, similar to the results from a study on Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}; this may suggest that, although superconductivity in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is conventional, while it is unconventional in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, both may exhibit a crossover from multiband superconductivity to single-band superconductivity with Ce substitution. In contrast, LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} appear to exhibit the same type of superconductivity as evidenced by the continuous and smooth behavior of T_{c} with increasing x in La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} and the power-law temperature dependence of specific heat in the superconducting state.

###### Abstract

Electrical resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements were performed on polycrystalline samples of the filled-skutterudite systems La_{1-x}_M_{x}_Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (_M_ = Ce and Th). Superconductivity in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} was quickly suppressed with Ce substitution and no evidence for superconductivity was found down to 1.1 K for x > 0.2. Temperature-dependent specific heat data at low temperatures for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} show a change from power-law to exponential behavior, which may be an indication for multiband superconductivity in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}. A similar crossover was observed in the Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} system. However, the suppression rates of the superconducting transition temperatures _T_{c}_(_x_) in the two systems are quite disparate, indicating a difference in the nature of superconductivity, which is conventional in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and unconventional in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}. In comparison, a nearly linear and smooth evolution of _T_{c}_ with increasing Th was observed in the La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} system, with no change of the superconducting energy gap in the temperature dependence of the specific heat, suggesting similar types of superconductivity in both the LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} compounds.

## 1 Introduction

Recently, a new branch of filled skutterudites was discovered with the chemical formula _A_Pt_{4}Ge_{12}[1, 2]. Several members of this branch were found to exhibit superconductivity with A = La and Pr exhibiting the highest superconducting transition temperatures, _T_{c}_\sim 8 K [1, 2, 3]. Considerable attention has been focused on PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} as it exhibits signs of unconventional superconductivity [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. However, investigations into SrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} show that the superconductivity is conventional BCS-type which originates from, and is intrinsic to, the Pt-Ge cages [1]. Furthermore, LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} was also found to exhibit evidence for conventional BCS-type superconductivity from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ^{73}Ge nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements [11, 12].

The compound CePt_{4}Ge_{12} is thought to lie on the border between an intermediate-valence (IV) and a Kondo lattice compound [11]. Initial investigations into CePt_{4}Ge_{12} revealed a broad maximum in the magnetization _M_(_T_), which can be a characteristic of intermediate-valence compounds. However, high-resolution x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements indicated that the Ce ions exhibit a temperature-independent valence close to \sim3^{+}[13]. Recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements find a wider quasielastic peak at higher energies, consistent with an IV system, as well as the absence of crystalline electric field effects expected in a Kondo system [14].

Therefore we decided to investigate the La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} system to complement our previous study of the Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} system. We anticipated that these two investigations could provide valuable insight into the nature of superconductivity in the Pt-Ge based filled skutterudites. Additionally, studies of ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} have uncovered signatures of an exotic form of superconductivity from \muSR measurements [15], power-law contributions to specific heat [16], and a complex Fermi surface from band-structure calculations [17]; these results motivated a parallel study on the system La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}.

We found that _T_{c}_ in La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is suppressed rapidly and almost linearly with increasing x, with the onset of superconductivity no longer being observable down to 1.1 K for x > 0.2. In contrast, the onset of superconductivity in Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} persists up to x = 0.5, and the _T_{c}_ versus x curve has pronounced positive curvature [9]. In the La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} system, we observed a smooth and continuous change in _T_{c}_ versus x, which is inconsistent with the behavior that would be expected for the existence of different types of superconducting states [18, 19]; i.e., the continuous and smooth behavior of _T_{c}_ versus x instead suggests that both LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} exhibit the same type of superconductivity.

A change in the temperature dependence of the specific heat in the superconducting state of La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is observed; this may be evidence for a crossover from multiband superconductivity in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} to isotropic single-band superconductivity in the x > 0 samples. A similar crossover in the specific heat behavior was observed when Ce was substituted into PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, a material with well-established evidence for multiband superconductivity [6, 7, 8, 9]. Specific heat measurements on the system La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} from x = 0 to x = 0.2 did not exhibit a similar change. Taken together with previous studies, it is possible that both LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} are multiband superconductors.

## 2 Experimental Details

Polycrystalline samples of La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (_x_ = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.80, 1) and La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (_x_ = 0,  0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) were synthesized in an atmosphere of ultrahigh-purity argon by arc-melting in a custom built arc furnace employing a zirconium getter on a water-cooled copper hearth. The starting materials were La ingots (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%), Ce rods (Alfa Aesar 3N, EPSI 99.9%), Th pieces, Pt sponge arc-melted into spheres (99.9999+%), and Ge pieces (Alfa Aesar 99.9999+%). The starting materials were weighed out in the molar stochiometric ratios, arc-melted together, and then flipped over and arc-melted again four more times to promote homogeneity. All samples were heat treated in a sealed quartz tube under an inert atmosphere (200 torr Ar) for 336 hours at 800 degC.

Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a Bruker D8 x-ray diffractometer with a Cu K_{a} source. Four-wire electrical resistivity measurements were performed from 300 K down to \sim1.1 K in a pumped ^{4}He Dewar. Magnetization measurements were performed between 300 and 2 K in a Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS) equipped with a 7-T superconducting magnet. Specific heat measurements were performed down to 1.8 K using a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) DynaCool. The heat capacity measurements employed a standard thermal relaxation technique.

## III Results

Rietveld refinements were performed on the powder XRD patterns for each sample using GSAS [20] and EXPGUI [21]. Displayed in Fig. 1(a) is an XRD pattern for La0.4Ce0.6Pt4Ge12, representative of the XRD patterns observed for values of x throughout both the La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 and La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12 systems. The blue line is the experimental XRD pattern and the red tick marks below locate the 2Th positions of the expected Bragg reflections for the refined filled-skutterudite crystal structure. The cubic filled-skutterudite crystal structure (space group _Im_\overline{3}) was observed over the entire range of x for both series. As is commonly observed in the Pt-Ge based skutterudites [2,7,8,11,14,22,23], small impurity phases of Ge and/or PtGe2 (at most up to \sim5% by mass) were detected in the samples. Figures 1(b) and 1(c) display the lattice parameter a for La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 (blue circles) and La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12 (teal pentagons) with dashed lines serving as guides to the eye. The system La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12 exhibits a linear decrease of a as x increases with the end members exhibiting a values of 8.618 A for x = 0 and 8.615 A for x = 1. The plot of a versus x for La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 shows a sudden increase in a of about 0.3% at x = 1. This may be because the XRD measurements for the sample with x = 1 were made using a different x-ray diffractometer. Another possible explanation for the larger a value for the sample with x = 1 is that there is a known sample dependence in the Pt-Ge based filled skutterudites; reported values for a of _M_Pt4Ge12 (_M_ = La, Pr, Nd, Ce) differ by roughly 0.5% [2,11].

The electrical resistivity _r_(_T_), measured in zero applied magnetic field, is displayed for the series La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 in Fig. 2(a) and La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12 in Fig. 2(b). The system La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 exhibits an overall increase in _r_(_T_) with increasing x, except for x = 1 at low temperature, which exhibits a large decrease below 150 K. The overall shape of _r_(_T_) exhibits the behavior of a simple metal, while at higher temperature, it has a negative curvature. This type of _r_(_T_) behavior is often observed in the Ce-based filled skutterudites such as CeFe4Sb12[24]. However, for La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12, _r_(_T_) does not exhibit any clear trend with increasing x, possibly due to uncertainties in the measurement of the geometrical factors of the resistivity samples. Plotted in Fig. 2(c) are the scaled _r_(_T_) data for the system La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 such that the slopes, _d_r_/_dT_, are identical to _d_r_/_dT_ for LaPt4Ge12 at high temperature. The scaled _r_(_T_) data clearly show that additional electron scattering associated with the 4f electrons is introduced by Ce substitution. In contrast, when the same procedure is performed on the _r_(_T_) data for La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12, displayed in Fig. 2(d), the scaled _r_(_T_) data collapse onto a single curve, suggesting that Th substitution does not introduce any additional mechanisms for scattering electrons. The intrinsic differences in the _r_(_T_) curves in Fig. 2(b) are due to differences in lattice scattering (electron-phonon scattering depends on the Debye temperature, _r_D = 220 K [13], in the Bloch-Gruneisen formula), and the nonmonotonic trend of the unscaled r at 300 K may be a consequence of errors in estimating the geometrical factor for the x = 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 samples.

For the La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 and La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12 series, the _r_(_T_) data are well described by _r_(_T_) = r00 + _AT_2 up to ~250 K2 in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d), indicating that both systems exhibit Fermi liquid behavior. A is a fitting parameter and r0 is the residual resistivity. The insets in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) plot the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) as a function of x for La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 and La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12, respectively, where the RRR is defined as r000/_r_0, where r00 is the value of r at 300 K. The RRR versus x exhibits a parabolic shape with the minimum at x = 0.6 for both La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 (RRR = 3)

Black asterisks indicate Bragg reflections associated with a Ge/PtGe2 impurity phase. The lattice parameter, _α_, is plotted for La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 in (b) and for La1−xTh,Pt4Ge12 in (c). The dashed lines are guides to the eye. The _α_ versus x data for both La1−xCe,Pt4Ge12 and La1−xTh,Pt4Ge12 obey Vegard’s law, except for x = 1, in La1−xCe,Pt4Ge12, where _α_ has a larger value (see text). The _α_ values for LaPt4Ge12, CePt4Ge12, and ThPt4Ge12 are plotted for comparison.

  and La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (RRR = 10), close to the predicted minimum for simple alloys at x=0.5.

There are clear drops in \rho(T) at T_{c}. To determine T_{c}, the ratio \rho(T)/\rho_{10}, where \rho_{10} is \rho(T=10 K) (a representative value of \rho(T) in the normal state) was plotted versus T in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} and La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, respectively. T_{c} was defined as the temperature where \rho(T)/\rho_{10}=0.5 and the width of the transition was characterized by the temperatures where \rho(T)/\rho_{10}=0.9 and 0.1. For La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, T_{c} is rapidly suppressed with increasing x, with only the onset of superconductivity observed for x=0.2 from measurements down to 1.1 K. In the system La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, T_{c} is also suppressed with increasing x, from 8.3 K for x=0 down to 4.5 K for x=1. Th substitution suppresses T_{c} less rapidly than Ce substitution; however, this is not surprising since its 5f electron shell is empty so that Th is nonmagnetic and ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} exhibits superconductivity. In contrast, CePt_{4}Ge_{12} exhibits no ordered state down to 50 mK [11, 13, 25].

Magnetization divided by magnetic field, M/H, versus T data for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} are shown in Fig. 4(a) where the M(T)/H data were scaled by a factor of 1000 for clarity. M(T)/H exhibits Curie-Weiss behavior above 200 K for all x and passes through a broad maximum around 80 K, followed by an upturn as T\to 0 K. The deviations from Curie-Weiss behavior, manifested by the broad maxima, could be an indication of either intermediate-valence (IV) behavior of Ce or Kondo lattice behavior [2]. The broad maxima become smaller in amplitude and width as the peak position shifts to lower temperatures with decreasing x, as seen in Fig. 4(c). This behavior may suggest that the local Kondo temperature, T_{K}, also decreases with decreasing x and that the 4f electrons are well localized at high temperatures. If T_{K} arises from the fully trivalent Ce^{3+}, then La substitution would weaken the Ce-Ce interactions, which would suppress the broad maxima as well as T_{K}. However, it should be noted that this behavior differs from that observed for La substitution into the compound CeRu_{4}Sb_{12}, where the broad maximum in M(T) does not shift in temperature with increasing La concentration [26]. The small upturns in M(T)/H as T\to 0 K do not scale with x, making the upturns more likely due to small amounts of paramagnetic impurities, as described in previous literature [9, 10, 27], instead of being a signature of non-Fermi liquid behavior [28]. Both \chi_{300}, M(T)/H at

The superconducting critical temperature T_{c}, where T_{c} is defined as \rho(T)/\rho_{10}=0.5, for both systems decreases with increasing x. Measurements down to 1.1 K reveal that the onset of superconductivity is observable up to x=0.2 for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. The T_{c} for La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} decreases almost linearly with x, with the lowest value of T_{c}=4.5 K observed for x=1.0, close to the reported value [16, 15].

Linear fits of \rho(T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{2} were performed up to roughly 250 K^{2}.

The inset displays the residual resistivity ratio RRR (\rho_{100}/\rho_{0}) versus x for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (blue circles for this work), plotted as a function of x.

  300 K, and \chi_{0}, M(T)/H as T\to 0 K, are enhanced with increasing x, \chi_{300} increases from \sim0 cm^{3}/mol for x=0 to 2.3\times 10^{-3} cm^{3}/mol for x=1. \chi_{0} was determined by extrapolating M(T)/H as T\to 0 K from data at temperatures above those where the broad upturns are observed. As can be seen in Fig. 4(b), \chi_{0} increases with increasing x, exhibiting an almost tenfold increase from \chi_{0}=0.39\times 10^{-3} cm^{3}/mol for x=0 up to \chi_{0}=3.69\times 10^{-3} cm^{3}/mol for x=1.

Curie-Weiss law fits were performed on the M(T)/H data between 200 and 300 K for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}; this temperature range was used because the broad maxima in M(T)/H made fitting to lower temperatures inappropriate. The effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff} and Curie-Weiss temperature \theta_{CW} for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} were determined using the relation M(T)/H=C_{0}/(T-\theta_{CW}), where C_{0}=\mu_{\rm eff}^{2}N_{A}/3k_{B}, N_{A} is Avagadro's number and k_{B} is Boltzmann's constant. The values we obtained for \mu_{\rm eff} and \theta_{CW} are plotted in Figs. 4(d) and 4(e), respectively. \mu_{\rm eff}=2.67\mu_{B}/Ce for x=1, which is slightly larger than the predicted value of 2.54 \mu_{B} for the Ce^{3+} electronic configuration using Hund's rules; the limited temperature range for the Curie-Weiss fits, caused by the broad maximum, is possibly responsible for the disparity between the measured and calculated \mu_{\rm eff} values. The effective moment \mu_{\rm eff} increases slowly with decreasing x and exhibits values close to the free ion values derived from Hund's rules, reaching 3.16 \mu_{B}/Ce for x=0.2. The Curie-Weiss temperature \theta_{CW}=-83 K of CePt_{4}Ge_{12} has a magnitude about twice as large as the value originally reported (\theta_{CW}=-39.2 K) [13], and within the scatter of the data, remains nearly constant with a value of -80 K throughout the entire series.

M(T)/H measurements were performed for La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} samples in an applied magnetic field H=10 Oe to determine T_{c} and the superconducting volume fraction, v, as can be seen in Fig. 5. The superconducting volume fraction, v, was estimated using the equation M(T)/H\times d=v, where M(T)/H is in units of emu/mol and d is the molar density of the compound in units of mol/cm^{3}. T_{c} for LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is 8 K, and it is suppressed with increasing x down to 4.3 K for x=1, consistent with reported literature for the end-member compounds [2,3]. The volume fraction, v, is consistently near -1 for all x. This is evidence that the sample completely expels magnetic fields and is consistent with bulk superconductivity.

Specific heat divided by temperature C(T)/T versus T plots for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (x=0, 0.05, and 0.1) and for La_{0.8}Th_{0.2}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} are displayed in Fig. 6(a). T_{c} was determined from idealized equal entropy conserving constructions about the specific heat jump associated with superconductivity as seen for La_{0.95}Ce_{0.05}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} in the inset of Fig. 6(a). In La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, T_{c} was rapidly suppressed with increasing x: from T_{c}=8.3 K for x=0 down to T_{c}=3.2 K for x=0.1. For La_{0.8}Th_{0.2}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, only a small decrease in T_{c} was observed, shifting down to T_{c}=7.3 K.

Linear fits using the equation C(T)/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2} were performed on the specific heat data from the lowest temperature in the normal state up to temperatures as high as linear fits were possible to determine the Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma and Debye temperature \Theta_{D}. The coefficient of the phonon contribution to the specific heat \beta is related to \Theta_{D} by the relation \Theta_{D}=[1944\times(n/\beta)]^{1/3} K, where n=17 is the number of atoms in the formula unit. The electronic contribution to specific heat \gamma exhibits a moderate increase with initial Ce substitution where \gamma=50 mJ/mol K^{2} for x=0

(b) The low-temperature magnetic susceptibility \chi_{0}, plotted as a function of x. \chi_{0} was determined by extrapolating M(T)/H data to T\to 0 K while ignoring the small upturns observed at the lowest temperatures; these were determined to be due to small amounts of paramagnetic impurities. (c) T^{*}, the temperature where the broad maximum in the M/H versus T data is centered as indicated by the black arrows in (a), plotted versus x. The local maximum is possible evidence for either intermediate valence Ce or Kondo lattice behavior. T^{*} shifts to higher temperatures with increasing x, up to 80 K at x=1, consistent with reported literature for CePt_{4}Ge_{12}[11]. The effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff} and Curie-Weiss temperature \theta_{\rm CE} were determined from Curie-Weiss fits performed on the inverse M/H data in the temperature range 200–300 K and are plotted versus x in (d) and (e), respectively.

The superconducting critical temperature T_{c} decreases as x increases, from 8 K for x=0 down to 4.3 K for x=1. The nearly unity value of |4\pi\,M/H| is evidence for bulk superconductivity throughout the La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} series.

  and reaches 80 mJ/mol K^{2} for x=0.1, close to the reported values of \gamma\sim 100 mJ/mol K^{2} for CePt_{4}Ge_{12}[9, 13]. Thorium substitution results in a slight suppression of \gamma, where \gamma=30 mJ/mol K^{2} for La_{0.8}Th_{0.2}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, as shown in Fig. 6(b). \Theta_{D} appears to be insensitive to Ce or Th substitution, fluctuating less than 5% from \Theta_{D}=204 K for x=0, as seen in Fig. 6(c).

Interestingly, negative curvature was observed in the C/T versus T^{2} data as T\to 0 K for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} with x\geqslant 0.05. To investigate this behavior, the electronic contribution to the specific heat C_{c}(T) was determined by subtracting the phonon contribution from C(T)/T and plotting as \log(C_{e}(T)/\gamma T_{c}) versus T_{c}/T in Fig. 7(a) for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} and (b) for La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. The data sets were offset for clarity. The solid lines represent fits to each data set. For La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, C_{e}(T) for the samples with x=0.05 and 0.1 is well described by an exponential temperature dependence of the form be^{-(\Delta/T)}, where b is a fitting parameter and \Delta represents the superconducting energy gap. Best fit values for b were roughly 9.8 and 7.3 for x=0.05 and 0.1, respectively. The best fit values were \Delta/T_{c}=1.52 and 1.38 for x=0.05 and 0.1, respectively; while the values of \Delta/T_{c} could vary depending on the fitting range [30], the exponential behavior is still evidence for BCS superconductivity. Attempts to fit C_{e}(T) data for x=0 with the function be^{-(\Delta/T)} were unsuccessful. However, fits using a power-law function of the form cT^{n}, where c is a fitting parameter, were found to describe C_{e}(T) versus T for x=0 very well, where n=2.5. The change from cT^{n} to be^{-(\Delta/T)} temperature dependencies may be explained by a transition from a multiband superconductor to a single-band isotropic s-wave superconductor. C_{e}(T)\sim T^{n} behavior is also expected for superconductors with nodes in the energy gap with n=2 for line nodes and n=3 for point nodes [29], while C(T)\sim e^{-(\Delta/T)} behavior is expected for single-band isotropic s-wave superconductors. It should be noted that this type of analysis based on the temperature-dependence of the specific heat is believed to be valid at low temperatures (i.e., T\ll T_{c}) [29, 30]. However, our results, including the change of the temperature-dependence of the specific heat and the rapid initial suppression of T_{c}, are quite similar to those observed in the Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} system [9]; this matter has been further investigated by a recent study of the low-temperature specific heat, confirming a crossover in the superconducting gap structure [31]. Combining these factors, we believe that the change in the temperature-dependence of the specific heat is very likely intrinsic to La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. Noninteger values of n can be due to the contributions to specific heat from multiple superconducting gaps, as was observed in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[8]. Our results suggest that multiband superconductivity may also occur in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} as C(T) for this compound varies as T^{2.5} for T<T_{c}, which is consistent with a recent tunnel-diode-oscillator (TDO) and transverse-field muon-spin rotaion (TF-\muSR) spectroscopy measurements on LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, suggesting marginal two-gap superconductivity in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}[32]. A noninteger value of n for Ce substitution may indicate that the system has been driven to single-band conventional superconductivity. The cT^{n} behavior of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} was preserved with n=2.4 for La_{0.8}Th_{0.2}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}.

## IV Discussion

The T_{c} versus x curve for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (blue symbols), derived from \rho(T), M(T)/H, and C(T), is shown in Fig. 8. Dashed lines in the figure are guides to the eye. The T_{c} versus x curve for Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (red symbols) reported in Ref. [9] is also shown for comparison. Displayed in the inset is the T_{c} versus x curve for La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. In La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, the

The superconducting critical temperature T_{c} is suppressed with increasing x, with Ce substitution having a more pronounced effect than Th substitution. T_{c} values were determined from idealized equal entropy constructions fitted to the electronic contribution to specific heat, C_{e}/T, as shown in the inset for La_{0.95}Ce_{0.09}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. Linear fits were performed on the C/T data plotted versus T^{2} in the lowest-temperature regions in the normal state to determine the Sommerfeld efficient \gamma and the Debye temperature \Theta_{D}; these quantities are plotted in (b) and (c), respectively.

Figure 7: (a) and (b) The electronic contribution to specific heat plotted as \log(C_{e}/T\,T_{c}) versus T_{c}/T for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} and La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, respectively. The data sets were offset for clarity. For the La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} samples, the specific heat data are well described by an exponential temperature dependence of the form e^{-\Delta/T}, which is the expected behavior for an isotropic superconducting energy gap. However, the LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and La_{0.8}Th_{0.2}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} data exhibit a power-law T^{n} temperature dependence, where n\sim 2.5. This result may be consistent with multiband superconductivity.

  initial rate of suppression of T_{c}, (dT_{c}/dx)_{x=0}=-0.4 K/at. % Ce, is much larger in magnitude than (dT_{c}/dx)_{x=0}=-0.04 K/at. % Th for La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. Because of the positive curvature of T_{c} versus x in Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, we were only able to approximate (dT_{c}/dx)_{x=0} for x\leq 0.1 which yields (dT_{c}/dx)_{x=0}\sim-0.4 K/at. % Ce, close to the value obtained for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. The series La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} was found to exhibit a rapid and almost linear suppression of T_{c} with increasing Ce concentration, which extrapolated to 0 K near x\approx 0.2. While Ce substitution at low x produces a similar depression of T_{c} for both La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} and Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, at higher Ce concentrations, the T_{c} versus x curve for Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} develops strong positive curvature and appears to extrapolate to 0 K at x\approx 0.4, roughly twice the value of x where T_{c} vanishes for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}.

The T_{c} versus x curves for the Ln_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (Ln= La and Pr) systems shown in Fig. 8 reveal that the rate of depression of T_{c} with Ce concentration is similar for the two systems, both of which have values of T_{c}\approx 8 K at x=0, for x\lesssim 0.1, and is significantly weaker for Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} than La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} for 0.1\lesssim x\lesssim 0.2. This reveals that the Ce substituents produce stronger superconducting electron pair breaking in the LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} compound, in which the electronic correlations are relatively weak and the superconductivity is conventional [11, 12], than in the PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} compound, where the electronic correlations are stronger and the superconductivity is unconventional (e.g., superconductivity breaks time-reversal symmetry) [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Since the CePt_{4}Ge_{12} end member compound is also a correlated electron system [11], the electronic correlations associated with the Ce solutes apparently have a stronger pair breaking effect on the conventional superconductivity exhibited by the LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} parent compound than on the unconventional superconductivity displayed by the PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} parent compound. The shapes of the T_{c} versus x curves for the Ln_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (Ln= La and Pr) systems are reminiscent of metallic host metals that exhibit conventional superconductivity containing transition metal, lanthanide, and actinide solute ions with partially-filled d- or f-electron shells in which the normal ground state at superconducting temperatures is nonmagnetic [33]. In these systems, a characteristic temperature T_{0} associated with spin fluctuations, valence fluctuations, or the Kondo effect separates high-temperature local moment behavior, characterized by a Curie-Weiss law, and low-temperature nonmagnetic behavior, reflected in a magnetic susceptibility that approaches a finite value as T\to 0 K. When T_{0} is much larger than the T_{c} of the superconducting host metal (T_{c0}), the initial rate of depression of T_{c} can be quite large and have pronounced positive curvature, similar to that observed for Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. This behavior is well established, and exemplary systems in which it has been observed include the Al_{1-x}Mn_{x}[34], Th_{1-x}Ce_{x}[35], and Th_{1-x}U_{x}[36] systems, where the Al and Th host metals are conventional superconductors. If one assumes that the temperature at which the magnetic susceptibility of the Ln_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (Ln= La and Pr) samples attains a maximum value is of the order of the characteristic temperature T_{0}, then these systems are in the limit that T_{0}\gg T_{c0} (e.g., T_{0}\sim 50-100 K for both the La- and Pr-based systems). It is tempting to compare the T_{c} versus x data with theories of superconductivity in host-impurity systems that display the Kondo effect, such as the theory of Muller-Hartmann and Zittartz [37]. However, these theories are based on the host metal being a simple one-band conventional BCS superconductor and for noninteracting paramagnetic impurities. The Ln_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (Ln=La and Pr) compounds have complex Fermi surfaces with multiple sheets that apparently lead to multiband superconductivity [6, 7, 8, 9], large Ce solute concentrations in which the interactions between Ce ions increase with Ce concentration, and conventional superconductivity displayed by the La-based compound [11, 12] and unconventional superconductivity exhibited by the Pr-based compound [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

Previous studies show that C(T) for ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} exhibits a T^{3} temperature dependence for T<T_{c}, which may suggest that there are point nodes in the superconducting energy gap [16]. If this interpretation is correct, the superconductivity exhibited by ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} could be unconventional. Therefore chemical substitution between ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} and LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, might be expected to result in a pronounced minimum in T_{c}(x) due to competing superconducting phases as was observed in studies of the filled skutterudite system PrOs_{4-x}Ru_{x}Sb_{12}[18, 19, 38]. Instead, we observe a smooth and continuous T_{c} versus x curve for La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, showing no evidence for competing superconducting phases. One possible explanation for this behavior is that both LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} may be multiband superconductors, with each band exhibiting conventional BCS superconductivity. Band-structure calculations demonstrate that ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} exhibits multiple Fermi surface sheets, which is a requirement

Figure 8: Plots of the superconducting transition temperature, T_{c} versus Ce concentration x for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (blue symbols) and, for comparison, Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (red symbols) (Ref. [9]). The dashed lines are guides to the eye. The suppression of T_{c} with increasing x for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is greater than in Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. Whereas the T_{c} versus x curve for La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is nearly linear, the T_{c} versus x curve for Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} exhibits positive curvature. Shown in the inset is the T_{c} versus x curve for La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (purple squares). The response of T_{c} with increasing x is smooth and continuous. The reported T_{c} values for LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} (Ref. [13]) and ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} (Ref. [3]) are added as a red circle and blue triangle for reference.

  for multiband superconductivity [17]. Additionally, the T^{3} temperature-dependence of the specific heat was used to suggest point nodes in the energy gap; however, the power-law temperature dependence of C(T) can also be evidence of multiband superconductivity, as was suggested for PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[8]. With respect to LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, band-structure calculations also predict multiband crossings at the Fermi energy, E_{F}[6]. When we combine this with the results from the present study, which show that the specific heat of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} displays a power-law temperature-dependence in the superconducting state and that the response of superconductivity in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} to Ce substitution is similar to that in the potential multiband superconductor PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[6, 7, 8, 9], there is mounting evidence for multiband superconductivity in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}. The apparent similarity of the superconducting states of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} reinforces this possibility. However, further work will be necessary to definitively address the nature of the superconducting energy gap(s) in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}[29, 39].

## V Concluding remarks

The La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} and La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} systems were studied by means of electrical resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements. The broad maxima in the \chi(T) data for CePt_{4}Ge_{12} were suppressed with increasing La concentrations, both in temperature and amplitude, which may be due to weakening of the Ce-Ce interactions with increasing La concentration. Superconductivity in the La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} system was rapidly suppressed with increasing Ce concentration, with no evidence for superconductivity down to 1.1 K for x>0.2. The suppression of T_{c} in La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is significantly more rapid than previously observed in Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, supporting an interpretation that the superconductivity observed in these two systems is different in nature. Specific heat measurements in the superconducting state of La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} revealed a change from a power law to exponential temperature dependence, similar to the results from a study on Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}; this may suggest that, although superconductivity in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is conventional, while it is unconventional in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, both may exhibit a crossover from multiband superconductivity to single-band superconductivity with Ce substitution. In contrast, LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} appear to exhibit the same type of superconductivity as evidenced by the continuous and smooth behavior of T_{c} with increasing x in La_{1-x}Th_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} and the power-law temperature dependence of specific heat in the superconducting state.
