###### Abstract

Electrical resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements
were performed on polycrystalline samples of the filled-skutterudite
systems La_(1 − x)_M_(x)_Pt₄Ge₁₂ (_M_ = Ce and Th). Superconductivity in
LaPt₄Ge₁₂ was quickly suppressed with Ce substitution and no evidence
for superconductivity was found down to 1.1 K for x > 0.2.
Temperature-dependent specific heat data at low temperatures for
La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ show a change from power-law to exponential
behavior, which may be an indication for multiband superconductivity in
LaPt₄Ge₁₂. A similar crossover was observed in the
Pr_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ system. However, the suppression rates of the
superconducting transition temperatures _T_(c)_(_x_) in the two systems
are quite disparate, indicating a difference in the nature of
superconductivity, which is conventional in LaPt₄Ge₁₂ and unconventional
in PrPt₄Ge₁₂. In comparison, a nearly linear and smooth evolution of
_T_(c)_ with increasing Th was observed in the La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂
system, with no change of the superconducting energy gap in the
temperature dependence of the specific heat, suggesting similar types of
superconductivity in both the LaPt₄Ge₁₂ and ThPt₄Ge₁₂ compounds.

## 1 Introduction

Recently, a new branch of filled skutterudites was discovered with the
chemical formula _A_Pt₄Ge₁₂[1, 2]. Several members of this branch were
found to exhibit superconductivity with A = La and Pr exhibiting the
highest superconducting transition temperatures, _T_(c)_∼ 8 K [1, 2, 3].
Considerable attention has been focused on PrPt₄Ge₁₂ as it exhibits
signs of unconventional superconductivity [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
However, investigations into SrPt₄Ge₁₂ and BaPt₄Ge₁₂ show that the
superconductivity is conventional BCS-type which originates from, and is
intrinsic to, the Pt-Ge cages [1]. Furthermore, LaPt₄Ge₁₂ was also found
to exhibit evidence for conventional BCS-type superconductivity from
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ⁷³Ge nuclear quadrupole resonance
(NQR) measurements [11, 12].

The compound CePt₄Ge₁₂ is thought to lie on the border between an
intermediate-valence (IV) and a Kondo lattice compound [11]. Initial
investigations into CePt₄Ge₁₂ revealed a broad maximum in the
magnetization _M_(_T_), which can be a characteristic of
intermediate-valence compounds. However, high-resolution x-ray
absorption spectroscopy measurements indicated that the Ce ions exhibit
a temperature-independent valence close to ∼3⁺[13]. Recent inelastic
neutron scattering measurements find a wider quasielastic peak at higher
energies, consistent with an IV system, as well as the absence of
crystalline electric field effects expected in a Kondo system [14].

Therefore we decided to investigate the La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ system
to complement our previous study of the Pr_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ system.
We anticipated that these two investigations could provide valuable
insight into the nature of superconductivity in the Pt-Ge based filled
skutterudites. Additionally, studies of ThPt₄Ge₁₂ have uncovered
signatures of an exotic form of superconductivity from μSR measurements
[15], power-law contributions to specific heat [16], and a complex Fermi
surface from band-structure calculations [17]; these results motivated a
parallel study on the system La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂.

We found that _T_(c)_ in La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ is suppressed rapidly
and almost linearly with increasing x, with the onset of
superconductivity no longer being observable down to 1.1 K for x > 0.2.
In contrast, the onset of superconductivity in Pr_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂
persists up to x = 0.5, and the _T_(c)_ versus x curve has pronounced
positive curvature [9]. In the La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ system, we
observed a smooth and continuous change in _T_(c)_ versus x, which is
inconsistent with the behavior that would be expected for the existence
of different types of superconducting states [18, 19]; i.e., the
continuous and smooth behavior of _T_(c)_ versus x instead suggests that
both LaPt₄Ge₁₂ and ThPt₄Ge₁₂ exhibit the same type of superconductivity.

A change in the temperature dependence of the specific heat in the
superconducting state of La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ is observed; this may
be evidence for a crossover from multiband superconductivity in
LaPt₄Ge₁₂ to isotropic single-band superconductivity in the x > 0
samples. A similar crossover in the specific heat behavior was observed
when Ce was substituted into PrPt₄Ge₁₂, a material with well-established
evidence for multiband superconductivity [6, 7, 8, 9]. Specific heat
measurements on the system La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ from x = 0 to x = 0.2
did not exhibit a similar change. Taken together with previous studies,
it is possible that both LaPt₄Ge₁₂ and ThPt₄Ge₁₂ are multiband
superconductors.

## 2 Experimental Details

Polycrystalline samples of La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ (_x_ = 0, 0.05, 0.1,
0.15, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.80, 1) and La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ (_x_ = 0, 0.2,
0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) were synthesized in an atmosphere of ultrahigh-purity
argon by arc-melting in a custom built arc furnace employing a zirconium
getter on a water-cooled copper hearth. The starting materials were La
ingots (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9

Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a
Bruker D8 x-ray diffractometer with a Cu K_(a) source. Four-wire
electrical resistivity measurements were performed from 300 K down to
∼1.1 K in a pumped ⁴He Dewar. Magnetization measurements were performed
between 300 and 2 K in a Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement
System (MPMS) equipped with a 7-T superconducting magnet. Specific heat
measurements were performed down to 1.8 K using a Quantum Design
Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) DynaCool. The heat capacity
measurements employed a standard thermal relaxation technique.

## III Results

Rietveld refinements were performed on the powder XRD patterns for each
sample using GSAS [20] and EXPGUI [21]. Displayed in Fig. 1(a) is an XRD
pattern for La0.4Ce0.6Pt4Ge12, representative of the XRD patterns
observed for values of x throughout both the La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 and
La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12 systems. The blue line is the experimental XRD pattern
and the red tick marks below locate the 2Th positions of the expected
Bragg reflections for the refined filled-skutterudite crystal structure.
The cubic filled-skutterudite crystal structure (space group
_Im_$\overline{3}$) was observed over the entire range of x for both
series. As is commonly observed in the Pt-Ge based skutterudites
[2,7,8,11,14,22,23], small impurity phases of Ge and/or PtGe2 (at most
up to ∼5

The electrical resistivity _r_(_T_), measured in zero applied magnetic
field, is displayed for the series La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 in Fig. 2(a) and
La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12 in Fig. 2(b). The system La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 exhibits an
overall increase in _r_(_T_) with increasing x, except for x = 1 at low
temperature, which exhibits a large decrease below 150 K. The overall
shape of _r_(_T_) exhibits the behavior of a simple metal, while at
higher temperature, it has a negative curvature. This type of _r_(_T_)
behavior is often observed in the Ce-based filled skutterudites such as
CeFe4Sb12[24]. However, for La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12, _r_(_T_) does not exhibit
any clear trend with increasing x, possibly due to uncertainties in the
measurement of the geometrical factors of the resistivity samples.
Plotted in Fig. 2(c) are the scaled _r_(_T_) data for the system
La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 such that the slopes, _d_r_/_dT_, are identical to
_d_r_/_dT_ for LaPt4Ge12 at high temperature. The scaled _r_(_T_) data
clearly show that additional electron scattering associated with the 4f
electrons is introduced by Ce substitution. In contrast, when the same
procedure is performed on the _r_(_T_) data for La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12,
displayed in Fig. 2(d), the scaled _r_(_T_) data collapse onto a single
curve, suggesting that Th substitution does not introduce any additional
mechanisms for scattering electrons. The intrinsic differences in the
_r_(_T_) curves in Fig. 2(b) are due to differences in lattice
scattering (electron-phonon scattering depends on the Debye temperature,
_r_D = 220 K [13], in the Bloch-Gruneisen formula), and the nonmonotonic
trend of the unscaled r at 300 K may be a consequence of errors in
estimating the geometrical factor for the x = 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 samples.

For the La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 and La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12 series, the _r_(_T_) data
are well described by _r_(_T_) = r00 + _AT_2 up to  250 K2 in Figs. 3(c)
and 3(d), indicating that both systems exhibit Fermi liquid behavior. A
is a fitting parameter and r0 is the residual resistivity. The insets in
Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) plot the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) as a
function of x for La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 and La1-xTh,Pt4Ge12, respectively,
where the RRR is defined as r000/_r_0, where r00 is the value of r at
300 K. The RRR versus x exhibits a parabolic shape with the minimum at x
= 0.6 for both La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 (RRR = 3)

sample of La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 (_x_ = 0.6) where the blue line represents the
intensity versus 2θ and the red tick marks locate the 2θ positions of
the expected Bragg reflections for the refined filled-skutterudite
crystal structure. Black asterisks indicate Bragg reflections associated
with a Ge/PtGe2 impurity phase. The lattice parameter, _α_, is plotted
for La1-xCe,Pt4Ge12 in (b) and for La1−xTh,Pt4Ge12 in (c). The dashed
lines are guides to the eye. The _α_ versus x data for both
La1−xCe,Pt4Ge12 and La1−xTh,Pt4Ge12 obey Vegard’s law, except for x = 1,
in La1−xCe,Pt4Ge12, where _α_ has a larger value (see text). The _α_
values for LaPt4Ge12, CePt4Ge12, and ThPt4Ge12 are plotted for
comparison.

and La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ (RRR = 10), close to the predicted minimum
for simple alloys at x = 0.5.

There are clear drops in ρ(T) at T_(c). To determine T_(c), the ratio
ρ(T)/ρ₁₀, where ρ₁₀ is ρ(T = 10 K) (a representative value of ρ(T) in
the normal state) was plotted versus T in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) for
La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ and La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂, respectively. T_(c)
was defined as the temperature where ρ(T)/ρ₁₀ = 0.5 and the width of the
transition was characterized by the temperatures where ρ(T)/ρ₁₀ = 0.9
and 0.1. For La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂, T_(c) is rapidly suppressed with
increasing x, with only the onset of superconductivity observed for
x = 0.2 from measurements down to 1.1 K. In the system
La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂, T_(c) is also suppressed with increasing x,
from 8.3 K for x = 0 down to 4.5 K for x = 1. Th substitution suppresses
T_(c) less rapidly than Ce substitution; however, this is not surprising
since its 5f electron shell is empty so that Th is nonmagnetic and
ThPt₄Ge₁₂ exhibits superconductivity. In contrast, CePt₄Ge₁₂ exhibits no
ordered state down to 50 mK [11, 13, 25].

Magnetization divided by magnetic field, M/H, versus T data for
La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ are shown in Fig. 4(a) where the M(T)/H data
were scaled by a factor of 1000 for clarity. M(T)/H exhibits Curie-Weiss
behavior above 200 K for all x and passes through a broad maximum around
80 K, followed by an upturn as T → 0 K. The deviations from Curie-Weiss
behavior, manifested by the broad maxima, could be an indication of
either intermediate-valence (IV) behavior of Ce or Kondo lattice
behavior [2]. The broad maxima become smaller in amplitude and width as
the peak position shifts to lower temperatures with decreasing x, as
seen in Fig. 4(c). This behavior may suggest that the local Kondo
temperature, T_(K), also decreases with decreasing x and that the 4f
electrons are well localized at high temperatures. If T_(K) arises from
the fully trivalent Ce³⁺, then La substitution would weaken the Ce-Ce
interactions, which would suppress the broad maxima as well as T_(K).
However, it should be noted that this behavior differs from that
observed for La substitution into the compound CeRu₄Sb₁₂, where the
broad maximum in M(T) does not shift in temperature with increasing La
concentration [26]. The small upturns in M(T)/H as T → 0 K do not scale
with x, making the upturns more likely due to small amounts of
paramagnetic impurities, as described in previous literature [9, 10,
27], instead of being a signature of non-Fermi liquid behavior [28].

La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ in (b). The superconducting critical temperature
T_(c), where T_(c) is defined as ρ(T)/ρ₁₀ = 0.5, for both systems
decreases with increasing x. Measurements down to 1.1 K reveal that the
onset of superconductivity is observable up to x = 0.2 for
La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂. The T_(c) for La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ decreases
almost linearly with x, with the lowest value of T_(c) = 4.5 K observed
for x = 1.0, close to the reported value [16, 15]. Selected ρ versus T²

performed up to roughly 250 K².

La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂. The electrical resistivity at high temperature

residual resistivity ratio RRR (ρ₁₀₀/ρ₀) versus x for
La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ (blue circles for this work), plotted as a
function of x. The ratio exhibits a parabolic behavior with a minimum
RRR = 3 for x = 0.6. (b) ρ versus T for La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ which
tends to exhibit an overall decrease of ρ with increasing x. The RRR
versus x is displayed in the inset for La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ (purple
squares) with the minimum RRR = 10 at x = 0.6, similar to the parabolic
behavior observed in La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂. (c) Scaled ρ(T) data for
La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ such that the high-temperature slope dρ/dT

for the La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ system. The curves appear to collapse
onto a single curve.

300 K, and χ₀, M(T)/H as T → 0 K, are enhanced with increasing x, χ₃₀₀
increases from ∼0 cm³/mol for x = 0 to 2.3 × 10⁻³ cm³/mol for x = 1. χ₀
was determined by extrapolating M(T)/H as T → 0 K from data at
temperatures above those where the broad upturns are observed. As can be
seen in Fig. 4(b), χ₀ increases with increasing x, exhibiting an almost
tenfold increase from χ₀ = 0.39 × 10⁻³ cm³/mol for x = 0 up to
χ₀ = 3.69 × 10⁻³ cm³/mol for x = 1.

Curie-Weiss law fits were performed on the M(T)/H data between 200 and
300 K for La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂; this temperature range was used
because the broad maxima in M(T)/H made fitting to lower temperatures
inappropriate. The effective magnetic moment $\mu_{\rm eff}$ and
Curie-Weiss temperature θ_(CW) for La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ were
determined using the relation M(T)/H = C₀/(T − θ_(CW)), where
$C_{0}=\mu_{\rm eff}^{2}N_{A}/3k_{B}$, N_(A) is Avagadro’s number and
k_(B) is Boltzmann’s constant. The values we obtained for
$\mu_{\rm eff}$ and θ_(CW) are plotted in Figs. 4(d) and 4(e),
respectively. $\mu_{\rm eff}=2.67$μ_(B)/Ce for x = 1, which is slightly
larger than the predicted value of 2.54 μ_(B) for the Ce³⁺ electronic
configuration using Hund’s rules; the limited temperature range for the
Curie-Weiss fits, caused by the broad maximum, is possibly responsible
for the disparity between the measured and calculated $\mu_{\rm eff}$
values. The effective moment $\mu_{\rm eff}$ increases slowly with
decreasing x and exhibits values close to the free ion values derived
from Hund’s rules, reaching 3.16 μ_(B)/Ce for x = 0.2. The Curie-Weiss
temperature θ_(CW) = −83 K of CePt₄Ge₁₂ has a magnitude about twice as
large as the value originally reported (θ_(CW) = −39.2 K) [13], and
within the scatter of the data, remains nearly constant with a value of
−80 K throughout the entire series.

M(T)/H measurements were performed for La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ samples
in an applied magnetic field H = 10 Oe to determine T_(c) and the
superconducting volume fraction, v, as can be seen in Fig. 5. The
superconducting volume fraction, v, was estimated using the equation
M(T)/H × d = v, where M(T)/H is in units of emu/mol and d is the molar
density of the compound in units of mol/cm³. T_(c) for LaPt₄Ge₁₂ is 8 K,
and it is suppressed with increasing x down to 4.3 K for x = 1,
consistent with reported literature for the end-member compounds [2,3].
The volume fraction, v, is consistently near −1 for all x. This is
evidence that the sample completely expels magnetic fields and is
consistent with bulk superconductivity.

Specific heat divided by temperature C(T)/T versus T plots for
La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ (x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1) and for
La_(0.8)Th_(0.2)Pt₄Ge₁₂ are displayed in Fig. 6(a). T_(c) was determined
from idealized equal entropy conserving constructions about the specific
heat jump associated with superconductivity as seen for
La_(0.95)Ce_(0.05)Pt₄Ge₁₂ in the inset of Fig. 6(a). In
La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂, T_(c) was rapidly suppressed with increasing x:
from T_(c) = 8.3 K for x = 0 down to T_(c) = 3.2 K for x = 0.1. For
La_(0.8)Th_(0.2)Pt₄Ge₁₂, only a small decrease in T_(c) was observed,
shifting down to T_(c) = 7.3 K.

Linear fits using the equation C(T)/T = γ + βT² were performed on the
specific heat data from the lowest temperature in the normal state up to
temperatures as high as linear fits were possible to determine the
Sommerfeld coefficient γ and Debye temperature Θ_(D). The coefficient of
the phonon contribution to the specific heat β is related to Θ_(D) by
the relation Θ_(D) = [1944 × (n/β)]^(1/3) K, where n = 17 is the number
of atoms in the formula unit. The electronic contribution to specific
heat γ exhibits a moderate increase with initial Ce substitution where
γ = 50 mJ/mol K² for x = 0

versus T from 300 K down to 2 K for the La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ system.

exhibiting an almost tenfold increase between x = 0 and 1. (b) The
low-temperature magnetic susceptibility χ₀, plotted as a function of x.
χ₀ was determined by extrapolating M(T)/H data to T → 0 K while ignoring
the small upturns observed at the lowest temperatures; these were
determined to be due to small amounts of paramagnetic impurities. (c)
T^(*), the temperature where the broad maximum in the M/H versus T data
is centered as indicated by the black arrows in (a), plotted versus x.
The local maximum is possible evidence for either intermediate valence
Ce or Kondo lattice behavior. T^(*) shifts to higher temperatures with
increasing x, up to 80 K at x = 1, consistent with reported literature
for CePt₄Ge₁₂[11]. The effective magnetic moment $\mu_{\rm eff}$ and
Curie-Weiss temperature $\theta_{\rm CE}$ were determined from
Curie-Weiss fits performed on the inverse M/H data in the temperature
range 200–300 K and are plotted versus x in (d) and (e), respectively.

decreases as x increases, from 8 K for x = 0 down to 4.3 K for x = 1.
The nearly unity value of |4π M/H| is evidence for bulk
superconductivity throughout the La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ series.

and reaches 80 mJ/mol K² for x = 0.1, close to the reported values of
γ ∼ 100 mJ/mol K² for CePt₄Ge₁₂[9, 13]. Thorium substitution results in
a slight suppression of γ, where γ = 30 mJ/mol K² for
La_(0.8)Th_(0.2)Pt₄Ge₁₂, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Θ_(D) appears to be
insensitive to Ce or Th substitution, fluctuating less than 5

Interestingly, negative curvature was observed in the C/T versus T² data
as T → 0 K for La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ with x ≥ 0.05. To investigate
this behavior, the electronic contribution to the specific heat C_(c)(T)
was determined by subtracting the phonon contribution from C(T)/T and
plotting as log (C_(e)(T)/γT_(c)) versus T_(c)/T in Fig. 7(a) for
La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ and (b) for La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂. The data
sets were offset for clarity. The solid lines represent fits to each
data set. For La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂, C_(e)(T) for the samples with
x = 0.05 and 0.1 is well described by an exponential temperature
dependence of the form be^(−(Δ/T)), where b is a fitting parameter and Δ
represents the superconducting energy gap. Best fit values for b were
roughly 9.8 and 7.3 for x = 0.05 and 0.1, respectively. The best fit
values were Δ/T_(c) = 1.52 and 1.38 for x = 0.05 and 0.1, respectively;
while the values of Δ/T_(c) could vary depending on the fitting range
[30], the exponential behavior is still evidence for BCS
superconductivity. Attempts to fit C_(e)(T) data for x = 0 with the
function be^(−(Δ/T)) were unsuccessful. However, fits using a power-law
function of the form cT^(n), where c is a fitting parameter, were found
to describe C_(e)(T) versus T for x = 0 very well, where n = 2.5. The
change from cT^(n) to be^(−(Δ/T)) temperature dependencies may be
explained by a transition from a multiband superconductor to a
single-band isotropic s-wave superconductor. C_(e)(T) ∼ T^(n) behavior
is also expected for superconductors with nodes in the energy gap with
n = 2 for line nodes and n = 3 for point nodes [29], while
C(T) ∼ e^(−(Δ/T)) behavior is expected for single-band isotropic s-wave
superconductors. It should be noted that this type of analysis based on
the temperature-dependence of the specific heat is believed to be valid
at low temperatures (i.e., T ≪ T_(c)) [29, 30]. However, our results,
including the change of the temperature-dependence of the specific heat
and the rapid initial suppression of T_(c), are quite similar to those
observed in the Pr_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ system [9]; this matter has been
further investigated by a recent study of the low-temperature specific
heat, confirming a crossover in the superconducting gap structure [31].
Combining these factors, we believe that the change in the
temperature-dependence of the specific heat is very likely intrinsic to
La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂. Noninteger values of n can be due to the
contributions to specific heat from multiple superconducting gaps, as
was observed in PrPt₄Ge₁₂[8]. Our results suggest that multiband
superconductivity may also occur in LaPt₄Ge₁₂ as C(T) for this compound
varies as T^(2.5) for T < T_(c), which is consistent with a recent
tunnel-diode-oscillator (TDO) and transverse-field muon-spin rotaion
(TF-μSR) spectroscopy measurements on LaPt₄Ge₁₂, suggesting marginal
two-gap superconductivity in LaPt₄Ge₁₂[32]. A noninteger value of n for
Ce substitution may indicate that the system has been driven to
single-band conventional superconductivity. The cT^(n) behavior of
LaPt₄Ge₁₂ was preserved with n = 2.4 for La_(0.8)Th_(0.2)Pt₄Ge₁₂.

down to 2 K in zero magnetic field. The superconducting critical
temperature T_(c) is suppressed with increasing x, with Ce substitution
having a more pronounced effect than Th substitution. T_(c) values were
determined from idealized equal entropy constructions fitted to the
electronic contribution to specific heat, C_(e)/T, as shown in the inset
for La_(0.95)Ce_(0.09)Pt₄Ge₁₂. Linear fits were performed on the C/T
data plotted versus T² in the lowest-temperature regions in the normal
state to determine the Sommerfeld efficient γ and the Debye temperature
Θ_(D); these quantities are plotted in (b) and (c), respectively.

data sets were offset for clarity. For the La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂
samples, the specific heat data are well described by an exponential
temperature dependence of the form e^(−Δ/T), which is the expected
behavior for an isotropic superconducting energy gap. However, the
LaPt₄Ge₁₂ and La_(0.8)Th_(0.2)Pt₄Ge₁₂ data exhibit a power-law T^(n)
temperature dependence, where n ∼ 2.5. This result may be consistent
with multiband superconductivity.

initial rate of suppression of T_(c), (dT_(c)/dx)_(x = 0) = −0.4 K/at.

The T_(c) versus x curves for the Ln_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ (Ln= La and
Pr) systems shown in Fig. 8 reveal that the rate of depression of T_(c)
with Ce concentration is similar for the two systems, both of which have
values of T_(c) ≈ 8 K at x = 0, for x ≲ 0.1, and is significantly weaker
for Pr_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ than La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ for
0.1 ≲ x ≲ 0.2. This reveals that the Ce substituents produce stronger
superconducting electron pair breaking in the LaPt₄Ge₁₂ compound, in
which the electronic correlations are relatively weak and the
superconductivity is conventional [11, 12], than in the PrPt₄Ge₁₂
compound, where the electronic correlations are stronger and the
superconductivity is unconventional (e.g., superconductivity breaks
time-reversal symmetry) [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Since the CePt₄Ge₁₂ end
member compound is also a correlated electron system [11], the
electronic correlations associated with the Ce solutes apparently have a
stronger pair breaking effect on the conventional superconductivity
exhibited by the LaPt₄Ge₁₂ parent compound than on the unconventional
superconductivity displayed by the PrPt₄Ge₁₂ parent compound. The shapes
of the T_(c) versus x curves for the Ln_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ (Ln= La and
Pr) systems are reminiscent of metallic host metals that exhibit
conventional superconductivity containing transition metal, lanthanide,
and actinide solute ions with partially-filled d- or f-electron shells
in which the normal ground state at superconducting temperatures is
nonmagnetic [33]. In these systems, a characteristic temperature T₀
associated with spin fluctuations, valence fluctuations, or the Kondo
effect separates high-temperature local moment behavior, characterized
by a Curie-Weiss law, and low-temperature nonmagnetic behavior,
reflected in a magnetic susceptibility that approaches a finite value as
T → 0 K. When T₀ is much larger than the T_(c) of the superconducting
host metal (T_(c0)), the initial rate of depression of T_(c) can be
quite large and have pronounced positive curvature, similar to that
observed for Pr_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂. This behavior is well established,
and exemplary systems in which it has been observed include the
Al_(1 − x)Mn_(x)[34], Th_(1 − x)Ce_(x)[35], and Th_(1 − x)U_(x)[36]
systems, where the Al and Th host metals are conventional
superconductors. If one assumes that the temperature at which the
magnetic susceptibility of the Ln_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ (Ln= La and Pr)
samples attains a maximum value is of the order of the characteristic
temperature T₀, then these systems are in the limit that T₀ ≫ T_(c0)
(e.g., T₀ ∼ 50-100 K for both the La- and Pr-based systems). It is
tempting to compare the T_(c) versus x data with theories of
superconductivity in host-impurity systems that display the Kondo
effect, such as the theory of Muller-Hartmann and Zittartz [37].
However, these theories are based on the host metal being a simple
one-band conventional BCS superconductor and for noninteracting
paramagnetic impurities. The Ln_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ (Ln = La and Pr)
compounds have complex Fermi surfaces with multiple sheets that
apparently lead to multiband superconductivity [6, 7, 8, 9], large Ce
solute concentrations in which the interactions between Ce ions increase
with Ce concentration, and conventional superconductivity displayed by
the La-based compound [11, 12] and unconventional superconductivity
exhibited by the Pr-based compound [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

Previous studies show that C(T) for ThPt₄Ge₁₂ exhibits a T³ temperature
dependence for T < T_(c), which may suggest that there are point nodes
in the superconducting energy gap [16]. If this interpretation is
correct, the superconductivity exhibited by ThPt₄Ge₁₂ could be
unconventional. Therefore chemical substitution between ThPt₄Ge₁₂ and
LaPt₄Ge₁₂, might be expected to result in a pronounced minimum in
T_(c)(x) due to competing superconducting phases as was observed in
studies of the filled skutterudite system PrOs_(4 − x)Ru_(x)Sb₁₂[18, 19,
38]. Instead, we observe a smooth and continuous T_(c) versus x curve
for La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂, showing no evidence for competing
superconducting phases. One possible explanation for this behavior is
that both LaPt₄Ge₁₂ and ThPt₄Ge₁₂ may be multiband superconductors, with
each band exhibiting conventional BCS superconductivity. Band-structure
calculations demonstrate that ThPt₄Ge₁₂ exhibits multiple Fermi surface
sheets, which is a requirement

and, for comparison, Pr_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ (red symbols) (Ref. [9]).
The dashed lines are guides to the eye. The suppression of T_(c) with
increasing x for La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ is greater than in
Pr_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂. Whereas the T_(c) versus x curve for
La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ is nearly linear, the T_(c) versus x curve for
Pr_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ exhibits positive curvature. Shown in the inset
is the T_(c) versus x curve for La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ (purple
squares). The response of T_(c) with increasing x is smooth and
continuous. The reported T_(c) values for LaPt₄Ge₁₂ (Ref. [13]) and
ThPt₄Ge₁₂ (Ref. [3]) are added as a red circle and blue triangle for

for multiband superconductivity [17]. Additionally, the T³
temperature-dependence of the specific heat was used to suggest point
nodes in the energy gap; however, the power-law temperature dependence
of C(T) can also be evidence of multiband superconductivity, as was
suggested for PrPt₄Ge₁₂[8]. With respect to LaPt₄Ge₁₂, band-structure
calculations also predict multiband crossings at the Fermi energy,
E_(F)[6]. When we combine this with the results from the present study,
which show that the specific heat of LaPt₄Ge₁₂ displays a power-law
temperature-dependence in the superconducting state and that the
response of superconductivity in LaPt₄Ge₁₂ to Ce substitution is similar
to that in the potential multiband superconductor PrPt₄Ge₁₂[6, 7, 8, 9],
there is mounting evidence for multiband superconductivity in LaPt₄Ge₁₂.
The apparent similarity of the superconducting states of LaPt₄Ge₁₂ and
ThPt₄Ge₁₂ reinforces this possibility. However, further work will be
necessary to definitively address the nature of the superconducting
energy gap(s) in LaPt₄Ge₁₂[29, 39].

## V Concluding remarks

The La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ and La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ systems were
studied by means of electrical resistivity, magnetization, and specific
heat measurements. The broad maxima in the χ(T) data for CePt₄Ge₁₂ were
suppressed with increasing La concentrations, both in temperature and
amplitude, which may be due to weakening of the Ce-Ce interactions with
increasing La concentration. Superconductivity in the
La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ system was rapidly suppressed with increasing Ce
concentration, with no evidence for superconductivity down to 1.1 K for
x > 0.2. The suppression of T_(c) in La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ is
significantly more rapid than previously observed in
Pr_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂, supporting an interpretation that the
superconductivity observed in these two systems is different in nature.
Specific heat measurements in the superconducting state of
La_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ revealed a change from a power law to
exponential temperature dependence, similar to the results from a study
on Pr_(1 − x)Ce_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂; this may suggest that, although
superconductivity in LaPt₄Ge₁₂ is conventional, while it is
unconventional in PrPt₄Ge₁₂, both may exhibit a crossover from multiband
superconductivity to single-band superconductivity with Ce substitution.
In contrast, LaPt₄Ge₁₂ and ThPt₄Ge₁₂ appear to exhibit the same type of
superconductivity as evidenced by the continuous and smooth behavior of
T_(c) with increasing x in La_(1 − x)Th_(x)Pt₄Ge₁₂ and the power-law
temperature dependence of specific heat in the superconducting state.
