###### Abstract

We have successfully synthesized one member of LnFeAsO (Ln stands for
lanthanides) with Ln=Tb. By partial substitution of Tb³⁺ by Th⁴⁺,
superconductivity with onset T_(c) up to 52 K was observed. In the
undoped parent compound, the magnetic moments of Tb³⁺ ions order
antiferromagnetically (AFM) at T_(N) of 2.5 K, and there exists an
anomaly in the resistivity at T^(*) of about 124 K which corresponds to
the structural phase transition and/or AFM ordering of magnetic moments
of Fe²⁺ ions. This anomaly is severely suppressed by Th doping, similar
to the cases of F doped LnFeAsO series. Thermopower measurements show
that the charge carrier is electronlike for both undoped and Th-doped
compounds, and enhanced thermopower in Th-doped samples was observed.

The discovery of superconductivity at 26 K in LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) (Ref.
[1]) has led to a type of high-temperature superconductors containing
FeAs layers. The fluorine-doped family includes CeFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x)
(T_(c)=41 K), [2] PrFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) (T_(c)=52 K), [3]
NdFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) (T_(c)=52 K), [4] SmFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) (T_(c)=55
K), [5, 6, 7] and GdFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) (T_(c)=36 K), [8, 9] in addition
to LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x). By using a high-pressure synthesis method, a
family of oxygen-deficient superconductors RFeAsO_(1 − x) (R=La, Ce, Pr,
Nd, and Sm) (Ref. [10]) and GdFeAsO_(1 − x) (Ref. [11]) was discovered.
Through the Th⁴⁺ substitution at the lanthanide site in GdFeAsO, we have
recently obtained Gd_(1 − x)Th_(x)FeAsO superconductors with T_(c) up to
56 K. [12]

The parent compounds of these superconductors have the general formula
LnFeAsO (Ln=lanthanide), [13] whose structure can be described as the
stacking of alternative [Ln₂O₂]²⁺ layers and [Fe₂As₂]²⁻ layers. The
[Ln₂O₂]²⁺ layers act as a charge reservoir while the [Fe₂As₂]²⁻ layers
are superconductivity active. Heterovalent substitutions of F⁻-for-O²⁻
at the oxygen site or Th⁴⁺-for-Ln³⁺ at the lanthanide site in the
[Ln₂O₂]²⁺ layers inject electrons onto [Fe₂As₂]²⁻ layers, which results
in the occurrence of superconductivity. Unfortunately, the parent
compounds LnFeAsO were limited to Ln=La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd in the
literature. The LnFeAsO family member with Ln=Tb was mentioned as
ternary "TbFeAs", [14] but it was not reproduced as quaternary arsenide
oxides later. [13] Very recently a synthesis of TbFeAsO by high-pressure
reaction has been reported and superconductivity with T_(c) of 46 K has
been observed in F-doped TbFeAsO. [15] However, there are few reports on
the physical properties of this member probably due to the difficulty in
obtaining single phase samples with high purity. In this Brief Report,
we report the synthesis of highly pure single phase TbFeAsO and the
occurrence of superconductivity with T_(c) as high as 52 K induced by
the partial substitution of Tb³⁺ by Th⁴⁺. The magnetic properties of
undoped TbFeAsO were also investigated. Th doping also induces enhanced
thermopower in the normal state, which implies strong electron
correlation in this system.

Polycrystalline samples of Tb_(1 − x)Th_(x)FeAsO (_x_ = 0,0.1,0.2) were
synthesized by solid-state reaction in an evacuated quartz tube. The
starting materials are Tb, Tb₄O₇, ThO₂, Fe, and As, which are all with
high purity (≥99.95

Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed at room temperature using a
D/Max-rA diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation and a graphite
monochromator. The XRD diffractometer system was calibrated using
standard Si powders. Lattice parameters were refined by a least-squares
fit using at least 20 XRD peaks. The electrical resistivity was measured
with a standard four-probe method. The temperature dependence of dc
magnetization was measured on a Quantum Design magnetic property
measurement system (MPMS-5). The applied field was 1000 Oe for the
undoped parent TbFeAsO sample and 10 Oe for the superconducting samples.

Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of the Tb_(1 − x)Th_(x)FeAsO (_x_ =
0,0.1,0.2) samples. The XRD peaks of the parent compound (_x_=0) can be
well indexed based on the tetragonal ZrCuSiAs-type structure with the
space group P4/mmm and no obvious impurity phases were detected. The
refined lattice parameters are a = 3.8994(3) A and c = 8.4029(5) A for
_x_=0, smaller than those of the neighbor member GdFeAsO in the LnFeAsO
family. [12] In the case of the Th-doped samples, a small amount of ThO₂
impurity can be observed. The refined lattice constants are a =
3.8998(3) A, c = 8.4090(6) A and a = 3.9025(3) A, c = 8.4131(6) A for
_x_=0.1 and 0.2, respectively. Therefore, the lattice parameters
increase monotonically with increasing x. Because the ionic size of Th⁴⁺
is larger than that of Tb³⁺, [16] the above result suggests the
successful substitution of Tb³⁺ by Th⁴⁺. The incorporation of relatively
large Th⁴⁺ ions can also relax the lattice mismatch between Ln₂O₂
fluorite-type block layers and Fe₂As₂ conducting layers.

The temperature dependence of the resistivity for the undoped parent
compound (x=0) is shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2, and the magnetic
susceptibility is also shown in the lower panel. Obviously the
resistivity of the parent compound undergoes a sharp decrease below
T^(*) of 124 K, where T^(*) is defined as the peak position in the curve
of the derivative of resistivity versus temperature (shown in the inset
of the upper panel). Such an anomaly in the resistivity was also
observed in the other LnFeAsO parent compounds.[1, 6, 17] Low
temperature neutron and x-ray diffraction studies[18, 19, 20] have
demonstrated that this anomaly is associated with a structural
transition and/or antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition in LaFeAsO.
However, T^(*) is a little lower compared to the neighbor member
GdFeAsO.[12] We suggest that the decrease in T^(*) could be correlated
with the decrease in the radius of Ln³⁺ ions in the LnFeAsO parent
compounds. The magnetic susceptibility shows good Curie-Weiss behavior
and a drop in susceptibility appears around 2.5 K. Such a drop should be
ascribed to AFM ordering of the magnetic moments of Tb³⁺ ions. It should
be noted that there is a decreasing tendency in T_(N) as Ln goes from
the light rare-earth element (i.e., Sm) to the heavy one.[12, 21] The
effective magnetic moment is about 9.74 μ_(B) estimated from the fitting
parameters with the Curie-Weiss formula, which is close to the magnetic
moment (9.72 μ_(B)) of free Tb³⁺ ions.

The change of resistivity with Th doping is shown in Fig. 3. Upon Th
doping, the resistivity anomaly around T^(*) becomes less prominent and
superconductivity occurs. The onset transition temperatures T_(c)
(defined as the onset point in the resistive transition) are 45 and 52 K
for x=0.1 and 0.2, respectively. Similar to the F-doped superconductors
such as LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x), there is a kink in the resistivity above
T_(c) in the "underdoped" region. Even for the x=0.2 case, a kink is
still observed around 120 K. The inset of Fig. 3 shows the dc magnetic
susceptibility (χ) versus temperature for the x =0.2 sample measured
under zero-field cooling (ZFC) condition and H=10 Oe. A clear
superconducting transition begins at 52 K, consistent with the
resistivity measurement. The magnetic shielding fraction according to
the ZFC susceptibility is above 50

derivative of resistivity as a function of temperature. Lower panel:

H=1000 Oe. The inverse of the magnetic susceptibility versus temperature
is also shown to indicate the Curie-Weiss behavior. Inset shows the
enlarged plot at low temperatures.

Tb_(1 − x)Th_(x)FeAsO (x=0,0.1,0.2) samples. Inset shows the magnetic
susceptibility measured under zero-field-cooling condition and H =10 Oe.
Note that there exists a large contribution from the paramagnetic
moments of Tb³⁺ in the normal state.

shielding fraction is often observed in the polycrystalline samples [1]
and it could be due to the granular property of the samples and
existence of a few insulating impurities. The inhomogeneity of Th doping
in the samples could also broaden the superconducting transition.

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of thermopower for the
Tb_(1 − x)Th_(x)FeAsO (x=0, 0.1, 0.2) samples. All of the thermopower is
negative at room temperature, which means that the electronlike charge
carriers dominate. For the undoped parent compound, the thermopower
starts to increase abnormally from negative to positive below T^(*).
Similar anomalous increase in the thermopower below T^(*) is also
observed in the undoped LaFeAsO. [19] This implies that the electronic
state undergoes a severe change after the structural phase transition.
Such an anomaly is completely suppressed in the Th-doped samples. The
thermopower drops to zero quickly below the superconducting transition
temperature. The fact that both the anomaly in the resistivity and that
in the thermopower are severely suppressed by Th doping indicates that
superconductivity occurs as the AFM order is suppressed, which implies
that superconductivity and AFM order are two competing ground states in
this system. To our surprise, the absolute value of thermopower |S|
increases quickly with Th doping, and the maximum in |S| is about 108
μV/K for x=0.2, which is even comparable to that of the famous cobaltate
Na_(x)CoO₂. [22] It has been proposed that the doped iron oxypnictides
can be promising thermoelectric materials in refrigeration applications
around liquid nitrogen temperatures. [23] A rough estimate of |S|
according to the Mott expression gives a value of less than 10 μV/K for
F-doped LnFeAsO. [24] The observed value of |S| is more than 10 times
enhanced, which strongly suggests that the electron correlation is very
important in the Fe-based oxypnictide superconductors.

In summary, we have successfully synthesized one member of the LnFeAsO
family, TbFeAsO, without applying high pressure. By partial substitution
of Tb³⁺ by Th⁴⁺, bulk superconductivity with onset T_(c) up to 52 K is
induced. The magnetic moments of Tb³⁺ ions antiferromagnetically order
at T_(N) of 2.5 K in the parent compound. The anomaly in the resistivity
corresponding to the structural phase transition and/or AFM ordering of
magnetic moments of Fe²⁺ ions is suppressed by Th doping, which means
that superconducting order and AFM order are competing orders in this
system. Furthermore, the absolute value of thermopower increases
abnormally with Th doping, implying strong correlation between electrons
in this system.
