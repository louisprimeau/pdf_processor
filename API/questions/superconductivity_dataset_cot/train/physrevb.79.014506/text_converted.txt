###### Abstract

Systematic measurements of the resistivity, heat capacity,
susceptibility, and Hall coefficient are presented for single-crystal
samples of the electron-doped superconductor Ba(Fe1-_x_Co_)2As2. These
data delineate an _x-T_ phase diagram in which the single
magnetic/structural phase transition that is observed for undoped
BaFe2As2 at 134 K appears to split into two distinct phase transitions,
both of which are rapidly suppressed with increasing Co concentration.
Superconductivity emerges for Co concentrations above x   0.025 and
appears to coexist with the broken-symmetry state for an appreciable
range of doping up to x   0.06. The optimal superconducting transition
temperature appears to coincide with the Co concentration at which the
magnetic/structural phase transitions are totally suppressed, at least
within the resolution provided by the finite-step size between crystals
prepared with different doping levels. Superconductivity is observed for
a further range of Co concentrations before being completely suppressed
for x   0.18 and above. The form of this _x-T_ phase diagram is
suggestive of an association between superconductivity and a quantum
critical point arising from suppression of the magnetic and/or
structural phase transitions.

## I Introduction

BaFe2As2 is a prototypical member of a new family of Fe pnictides that
play host to high-temperature superconductivity. The stoichiometric
compound suffers a coupled structural and antiferromagnetic transition
at   140 K. [1] Suppression of the broken-symmetry state by either
applied pressure [2] or chemical doping [34] results in
superconductivity, and one of the key questions associated with this
entire class of material is the role played by spin fluctuations
associated with the incipient tendency toward magnetism. [5, 6]

Initial work on chemical substitution in BaFe2As2 focused on the
hole-doped material Ba1-_x_K_Fe2As2. [3] In this case, it has been
established that the structural/magnetic transition is totally
suppressed for K concentrations above x = 0.4, [7] whereas
superconductivity appears for a wide range of concentrations from x =
0.3 to 1. [7] More recently, it has been shown that Co substitution
[i.e., Ba(Fe1-_x_Co_)2As2] also suppresses the magnetic and structural
transitions, eventually leading to superconductivity. [4] Co-doped
BaFe2As2 is especially attractive for two reasons. First, from a
fundamental point of view, this material allows an exploration of the
interrelation between the structural/magnetic phase transitions with
superconductivity in the context of an electron-doped system. Second,
from a more practical perspective, crystal growth using cobalt does not
suffer from the inherent difficulties associated with using potassium.
Cobalt has neither a large vapor pressure nor attacks the quartz tubing
used to encapsulate the growths. It is thus possible to obtain more
homogeneous crystals and more reproducible synthesis conditions than is
otherwise feasible for potassium-doped samples.

In this paper we present results of resistivity, Hall-coefficient,
heat-capacity, and susceptibility measurements of single-crystal samples
of Ba(Fe1-_x_Co_)2As2. We find that the structural/magnetic phase
transition which occurs at 134 K in BaFe2As2 is rapidly suppressed and
splits into two successive phase transitions with increasing Co
concentration. The signatures of these two distinct phase transitions
are relatively sharp, and it is unlikely that this effect is associated
with phase separation due to a variation in Co concentration across an
individual sample. Superconductivity appears for Co concentrations 0.025
< x < 0.18, with a maximum _T__(c) for a Co concentration of x   0.06
coincident with the concentration at which the structural/magnetic phase
transitions are suppressed below _T__(c). The apparent coexistence of
superconductivity with the broken-symmetry state on the underdoped side
of the phase diagram is unlikely to be due to phase separation due to Co
inhomogeneity and mirrors what is seen for Ba1-_x_K_Fe2As2. [7] These
measurements establish an essential symmetry between electron and hole
doping of BaFe2As2, in which the appearance of superconductivity in both
cases is clearly associated with the suppression of the
magnetic/structural phase transitions. Nevertheless, there are some
clear differences that emerge from this study. Specifically, Co
substitution is found to be significantly more effective at suppressing
the structural/magnetic phase transitions than K substitution, and the
superconducting (SC) "dome" extends over a much smaller range of doping.
The resulting phase diagram is highly suggestive that superconductivity
is intimately related to the presence of a quantum critical point (QCP)
associated with the suppression of the structural and/or magnetic phase
transitions.

## II Results and Discussion

Single crystals of Ba(Fe1-_x_Co_)2As2 were grown from a self-flux using
similar conditions to published methods. [4, 8] Ba and FeAs in the molar
ratio 1:4 with additional Co were placed in an alumina crucible and
sealed in evacuated quartz tubes. The mixture was heated to 1150 ^(∘)C
and held for 24 h before slowly cooling to 1000 ^(∘)C, at which
temperature the remaining flux was decanted using a centrifuge. The
crystals have a platelike morphology, with the c axis perpendicular to
the plane of the plates, and grow up to several millimeters on a side.
The Co concentration was measured by electron mi croprobe analysis
(EMPA) using undoped BaFe₂As₂ and elemental Co as standards.
Measurements were made at several locations on each sample. Measured
values were close to the nominal melt composition in all cases, and the
variation in Co concentration across individual samples was typically
characterized by a standard deviation of 0.15

The in-plane electrical resistivity (ρ_(ab)) was measured with a
standard four-probe configuration using a Quantum Design physical
properties measurement system (PPMS) and the results are summarized in
Fig. 1. Data are shown normalized by the room-temperature resistivity
ρ_(ab)(300 K) to remove uncertainty in estimates of the absolute value
due to geometric factors.[9] The anomaly associated with the
magnetic/structural phase transition in undoped BaFe₂As₂ is clearly
visible at 134 K. This feature changes from a sharp drop in the
resistivity below the transition temperature for BaFe₂As₂ to an abrupt
upturn for Co-doped samples.[10] The anomaly is clearly suppressed in
temperature with increasing x. For samples with x > 0.035,
superconductivity is evident from a sharp drop to zero in the
resistivity, while the anomaly associated with the structural/magnetic
phase transition is still observable in the normal state. As x increases
beyond this value, the superconducting critical temperature _T_c
(defined here as the midpoint of the resistive transition) increases,
whereas the magnetic/structural anomaly continues to be suppressed.
Finally _T_c reaches the highest value of 24 K in the sample with x =
0.061 ("optimal" doping), for which the normal-state anomaly is no
longer observable. Further increasing x beyond this value results in an
eventual suppression of superconductivity ("overdoping"). For the sample
with x = 0.184, _T_c is below our instrumental base temperature of 1.8
K.

The suppression of the magnetic/structural phase transitions was also
followed by heat capacity measured for single-crystal samples by a
relaxation technique using a Quantum Design PPMS. Results are shown in
Fig. 2(a) for four representative Co concentrations. For undoped
BaFe₂As₂, a sharp peak at 134 K marks the first-order
structural/magnetic phase transition as reported previously.[11] With
increasing x both the transition temperature and the magnitude of the
peak are rapidly suppressed, until the anomaly becomes almost
unobservable for x > 0.036. In order to provide an estimate of the
phonon background, the heat capacity was also measured for an optimally
doped sample (i.e., x = 0.061, which is the smallest Co concentration
for which the magnetic/structural phase transition is totally
suppressed). These data were taken to lower temperature, revealing the
superconducting anomaly. Data for this particular Co concentration are
shown in Fig. 2(b) as ΔC/T vs T, where ΔC is the difference between the
heat capacity in the superconducting state _C_S and the normal state
_C_N. The latter quantity has been estimated over the plotted
temperature range from measurements made in a field of 14 T applied
along the c axis. These data indicate ΔC/T_(c) $\approx 23(\rm mJ/K^{2}$
mol) in zero field.

Careful inspection of the resistivity and heat-capacity data shown in
Figs. 1 and 2 reveals that the single anomaly associated with the
magnetic/structural phase transition which is seen for undoped BaFe₂As₂
splits into two distinct features for the Co-doped samples. In Fig. 3 we
show the resistivity and heat-capacity anomaly near these transitions
for the un

resistivity of Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co₀)₂As₂. Data are shown normalized by the
room-temperature resistivity ρ_(ab)(300 K) to remove uncertainty in
estimates of the absolute value due to geometric factors. Successive
data sets are offset vertically by 0.1 for clarity (except for x = 0
data, which are offset by 1.4). Values of the Co concentration x are
listed in the legend and were determined by microprobe analysis for all
concentrations except the specific sample with x = 0.070, for which x
was estimated based on the observed linear relation between nominal and
actual x.

doped and two lightly doped samples. It is evident that the single sharp
downturn in BaFe₂As₂ becomes two successive sharp changes in slope in
the resistivity of the lightly doped Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂. As for
the heat capacity, the single sharp first-order peak observed for
undoped BaFe₂As₂ becomes two distinct features, resembling a
second-order-like step followed by a lower temperature peak, reminiscent
of a broadened first-order transition.

To further investigate the apparent splitting of the structural/magnetic
phase transitions, magnetic-susceptibility and Hall-coefficient data
were also measured. Results are shown in Fig. 4 for two representative
Co concentrations. Significantly, both measurements indicate the
presence of two distinct phase transitions for x> 0 evidenced by
distinct breaks in the slope of each quantity. In the case of the
susceptibility, this effect is more clearly apparent as two peaks in the
derivative d(χT)/dT.[12] These data can be compared with the
heat-capacity measurements (right axis of the upper panels), where we
have explicitly subtracted the normal-state heat capacity of the
optimal-doped Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ with x=0.061 as described above,
to provide an estimate of the contribution to the heat capacity arising
from the two phase transitions. The background-subtracted heat capacity
is in excellent agreement with the derivative d(χT)/dT of the
susceptibility, which is proportional to the heat capacity near a
second-order phase transition.[13] These data are also in excellent
agreement with the derivative of the resistivity dρ/dT. In short, all
four measurements indicate unambiguously the presence of two distinct
phase transitions. It is very unlikely that this splitting arises from
Co inhomogeneity, which in its simplest form would cause a continuous
broadening rather than a distinct splitting of the two phase
transitions. Indeed, the presence of Co inhomogeneity can be inferred
from the broadening of each of these two phase transitions (Fig. 5), but
this effect remains less than the actual splitting.

Although the magnitude of the heat-capacity anomalies associated with
these two phase transitions is rapidly suppressed for x> 0.036,
nevertheless the close correspondence between the heat capacity and the
resistivity derivative can be used to follow these phase transitions to
even higher Co concentrations. Data for Co concentrations up to x=0.051
are shown in Fig. 5. As can be seen, both transitions marked as α and β
are broadened with increasing Co concentration; but the two specific
features which can be associated with the

x=0.016, and (c) x=0.025. In the upper panels, the heat capacity (right

contribution as described in the main text, together with the in-plane
susceptibility X_(ab) (left axis) and the derivative d(χT)/dT (arb.

ρ_(ab) (left axis) are shown together with the Hall coefficient R_(H)
(right axis) and the derivative dρ/dT (arb. units). Vertical dotted
lines mark successive phase transitions evident in all four physical
properties.

0.

critical temperatures for x=0.016, 0.025, and 0.036 remain visible in
the resistivity derivative even for x=0.045 and 0.051. For larger values
of the Co concentration, no phase transitions are evident above T_(c).

Based on the measurements described above, we can establish a
composition-temperature (x-T) phase diagram for Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂
shown in Fig. 6. Phase boundaries delineate the successive phase
transitions T_(σ), T_(β), and T_(c) as described above. In analogy to
the oxypnictide LaFeAsO (Ref. [14]) it is tempting to speculate that the
upper transition T_(σ) corresponds to the structural distortion, while
the lower transition T_(β) corresponds to the spin-density wave (SDW)
transition; but the current data are not sufficient to make this
association and further scattering and/or microscopic measurements will
be necessary to determine the nature of the two transitions.

The apparent coexistence of superconductivity with the broken-symmetry
SDW state on the underdoped side of the phase diagram raises the
question of whether there is macroscopic phase separation associated
with a variation in the Co concentration. For length scales above 1 μm
this can be ruled out based on the microprobe analysis. Specifically,
the standard deviation in the cobalt doping is much smaller than the
range across which we observed this coexistence. From a materials
viewpoint, it would also be surprising to find Co inhomogeneity on
shorter length scales given the large solid solubility. This does not,
however, rule out the intriguing possibility of a spontaneous phase
separation in an otherwise homogeneous material. In this regard
susceptibility measurements provide some insight.

Susceptibility data were taken for representative Co concentrations on
the underdoped and overdoped sides of the phase diagram, as well as for
an optimally doped sample. These measurements were made for applied
fields of 50 Oe oriented in the ab plane for both zero-field cooling
(zfc) and field cooling (fc) cycles. The measurements were then repeated
for each sample after grinding to a fine powder to examine the role of
screening currents. The results of these measurements are shown in Fig.
7. First we consider the single-crystal data (black data points).
Field-cooled values are relatively small for each Co concentration
indicative of substantial flux trapping. However, zero-field-cooled
values are large for both underdoped, optimally doped and overdoped
cases indicating the presence of significant screening currents. These
values do not change substantially when the single crystals are ground
to fine powders (red data points) for the optimally doped and overdoped
cases; but signifi

background phonon contribution as described in the main text. Data for
x=0.025 and 0.036 (marked by an asterisk in the legend) have been
multiplied by factors of 3 and 5, respectively, for clarity.

0.036 and from resistivity data alone for x =0.045 and 0.051.

cantly the underdoped material has a substantially smaller value for the
zfc susceptibility. It is clear that the underdoped material is still a
bulk superconductor. However, the ability of the underdoped material to
support screening currents is significantly reduced by powdering. This
effect might be related to the carrier concentration. Specifically, the
superfluid density will presumably be smaller for the underdoped
material given the coexistence with the SDW state, leading to larger
values for the penetration depth. In this case, it is possible that some
fraction of the grains in the finely powdered sample will have a size
smaller than the penetration depth, reducing the zfc susceptibility.
Equally, it is possible that powdering causes significant damage to the
surface of the resulting grains. The asymmetry of the superconducting
dome might then lead to a stronger suppression of superconductivity for
underdoped relative to overdoped samples. Most intriguingly, the lower
zfc susceptibility might also reflect the presence of intrinsic
inhomogeneity on the underdoped side of the phase diagram because the
percolating shielding currents do not encompass the entire sample. The
current measurements are not sufficient to determine the origin of this
rather dramatic effect on the susceptibility. Nevertheless, it is clear
that there is a substantial volume fraction even in the underdoped
region of the phase diagram, but the superconductivity is to some extent
more fragile, at least to the effect of powdering.

The phase diagram shown in Fig. 6 is highly suggestive of a scenario in
which the superconductivity is intimately related to the presence of a
quantum critical point associated with the eventual suppression of the
structural and/or magnetic phase transitions. For instance, similar
phase diagrams are obtained for CePd₂Si₂ (Ref. [15]) and UGe₂,[16] for
which antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phase transitions,
respectively, can be suppressed by applied pressure, and for which
magnetic interactions are believed to be responsible for both
superconductivity and also non-Fermi-liquid behavior in the vicinity of
the QCP. Clearly this needs to be investigated in greater detail.
Nevertheless, this observation raises the question of whether a similar
mechanism is at work in the hole-doped analog Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ and
more broadly for all of the superconducting Fe pnictides. In the
specific case of BaFe₂As₂, Co doping is clearly more effective at
suppressing the magnetic/structural transitions than K doping; but it
remains to be determined whether this is related to an asymmetry in the
electronic structure or to other possibilities.

During preparation of this paper we became aware of two similar studies
of the effects of Co substitution in BaFe₂As₂. In the first of these, Ni
_et al._[17] mapped out a similar phase diagram, also finding a
splitting of the magnetic/structural phase transition. These results
broadly corroborate our findings. In the second, Ning _et al._[18] used
NMR measurements to follow spin dynamics for representative underdoped
and overdoped samples, also surmising the presence of a quantum critical
point.

## III Conclusion

In conclusion, we have determined the phase diagram for the
electron-doped superconductor Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂. We find that the
single structural/magnetic phase transition that occurs in BaFe₂As₂
splits with Co doping, although the nature of the two split transitions
remains to be determined. Critical temperatures associated with both
transitions are progressively reduced with increasing Co concentration
and are suppressed below T_(c) coincident with optimal doping. The
superconducting "dome" extends over a limited range of Co concentrations
from x=0.025 to x=0.18. These observations clearly delineate regions of
the x-T phase diagram for which further experiments have the potential
to reveal the interplay between the structural/magnetic and
superconducting phase transitions.

difference between the resistivity anomaly associated with the

that a substantial fraction of the FS of BaFe₂As₂ is gapped below the
SDW transition (Ref. [19]). In this case, we can speculate that there is
a subtle balance between effects associated with the reduction in the
number of carriers and changes in the scattering. We note that the
resistivity anomaly associated with the magnetic/ structural phase
transitions observed for intermediate Co concentrations is reminiscent
of that which is observed for BaFe₂As₂ grown from a Sn flux (Ref. [20]),
possibly indicating that Sn substitution also affects the scattering in
a similarly sensitive manner. * [11] J.-K. Dong, L. Ding, H. Wang, X. F.
