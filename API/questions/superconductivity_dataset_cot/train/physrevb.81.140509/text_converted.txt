###### Abstract

We report systematic ⁷⁵As-NQR and ¹³⁰La-NMR studies on nickel pnictide
superconductors LaNiAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) (x=0, 0.06, 0.10, and 0.12). The
spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T₁ decreases below T_(c) with a
well-defined coherence peak and follows an exponential decay at low
temperatures. This result indicates that the superconducting gap is
fully opened and is strikingly different from that observed in
iron-pnictide analogs. In the normal state, 1/T₁T is constant in the
temperature range T_(c)∼4 K≤T≤10 K for all compounds and up to T=250 K
for x=0 and 0.06, which indicates weak electron correlations and is also
different from the iron analog. We argue that the differences between
the iron and nickel pnictides arise from the different electronic band
structure. Our results highlight the importance of the peculiar
Fermi-surface topology in iron pnictides. We also provide a possible
interpretation for the "pseudogap-like" behavior in the normal state
which is also seen in iron pnictides.

Superconductivity in ReFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) (Re: rare-earth element) at
the transition temperature up to T_(c)=55 K (Refs. [1] and [2]) has
received considerable attention. These compounds have a ZrCuSiAs-type
structure (P4/nmm) in which FeAs forms a two-dimensional network similar
to the CuO₂ plane in the case of cuprate high-T_(c) superconductors. By
replacing O with F, electrons are doped and superconductivity emerges.
The Fermi surface consists of two hole pockets centered at (0, 0) (Γ
point) of the unfolded Brillouin zone, and two electron pockets around
(π, 0).[3] Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement in
PrFeAsO_(0.98)F_(0.11) suggested that there are multiple superconducting
gaps.[4] Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has directly
observed the gaps on different Fermi surfaces.[5]

However, the symmetry of the superconducting gap and the mechanism of
the superconductivity remains unclear. The spin-lattice relaxation rate
1/T₁ shows neither a coherence peak just below T_(c) nor an exponential
decay at low temperature (T) (Refs. [4], [6], and [7]) expected for
conventional fully gapped superconductors. The result was interpreted as
indicative of nodes in the gap function. On the other hand, tunneling[8]
and ARPES (Ref. [5]) measurements have suggested a full gap. The
penetration depth measurements by different groups[9, 10] have led to
different conclusion on whether there are nodes in the gap function or
not.

In the normal state, antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations with wave
vector Q=(π, 0) is expected due to the nesting between the electronlike
Fermi surface and the holelike Fermi surface.[11, 12, 13, 14] Indeed,
signatures of such spin fluctuating as seen in LaFeAsO_(0.92)F_(0.08)
(Ref. [15]) and Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ (Refs. [16, 17, 18]) were 1/T₁T
increases with decreasing temperature. It has been proposed that such
spin fluctuations may promote superconductivity with s⁻²-wave gap that
changes sign on different Fermi surfaces.[11, 12, 19] In such case, the
scatterings between different Fermi surfaces may reduce the coherence
peak in the T dependence of 1/T₁,[13, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22] thereby reconcile the discrepancy between NMR and
tunneling/ARPES measurements. However, experimental verification of such
exotic superconducting state remains to be carried out to be carried
out.

Meanwhile, the nickel analog of LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x), namely,
LaNiAsO_(1 − x)F_(x), are superconducting but with a lower T_(c)∼4
K.[24] Local-density approximation calculation has revealed a striking
difference in Fermi surface compared to the Fe analog. Namely, there are
no hole pockets around the (0, 0) point for LaNiAsO_(1 − x)F_(x).[25]
Since interband scattering between the electron and hole pockets with
the wave vector Q=(π, 0) is proposed to be responsible for both the
superconductivity and the normal-state properties for
LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x), the LaNiAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) without such
Fermi-surface nesting is an ideal compound to compare with and to obtain
insight into LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x). In particular, identifying

the superconducting gap symmetry and the nature of electron
correlations, if any, in LaNiAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) will help test the
theoretical proposals and understand the mechanisms of high-T_(c)
superconductivity in iron pnictides.

In this Rapid Communication, we report a microscopic measurement on
LaNiAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) (x=0, 0.06, 0.10, and 0.12) using the ⁷⁵As nuclear
quadrupole resonance (NQR) and ¹³⁵La-NMR techniques. The spin-lattice
relaxation rate, 1/T₁, shows a well-defined coherence peak just below
T_(c) and decays exponentially with further decreasing T, indicating a
fully opened superconducting gap on the entire Fermi surface. This is
clear NMR/NQR evidence for a full gap in the pnictide superconductors.
In the normal state above T_(c), no antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations
were observed. These features are striking different from
LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) where high-T_(c) unusual superconductivity emerges
with moderate strength of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation as a
background. The difference is understood by the different topology of
the Fermi surface of the two classes of materials. Our results highlight
the importance of the Fermi-surface topology in Fe pnictides and shed
lights on the mechanism of superconductivity and electron correlations
there.

The polycrystalline samples of LaNiAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) were synthesized by
the solid-state reaction method using NiO, Ni, As, La, and LaF₃ as
starting materials.[24] LaAs was prepared by reacting La chips and As
pieces at 500 ^(∘)C for 15 h and then at 850 ^(∘)C for 2 h. The raw
materials were thoroughly ground and pressed into pellets and then
annealed at 1150 ^(∘)C for 50 h. Powder x-ray diffraction indicates that
the samples are of single phase. For NQR measurements, the pellets were
ground into powder. T_(c) was determined by dc susceptibility
measurement on the powders using a superconducting quantum interference
device and by ac susceptibility measurement using the _in situ_ NQR
coil. The results by the two methods agree well. The NQR spectra were
taken by changing the frequency point by point while the NMR spectra
were taken by sweeping the magnetic field at a fixed frequency. The 1/T₁
was measured at zero magnetic field (NQR) by using a single saturation
pulse. Measurements below T=1.3 K were conducted by using a ³He-⁴He
dilution refrigerator.

Figure 1 shows the dc susceptibility around T_(c) and the NQR spectra of
⁷⁵As (I=3/2). The nuclear quadrupole frequency ν_(Q) increases slightly
with increasing F content.

Figure 2 shows the T dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate,
1/T₁, at zero magnetic field, for the two samples with higher T_(c). The
T₁ was measured at the peak of the spectrum and determined from an
excellent fit of the nuclear magnetization to the single exponential
function 1 −M(t)/M₀=exp(−3t/T₁), where M₀ and M(t) are the nuclear
magnetization in the thermal equilibrium and at a time t after the
saturating pulse, respectively. The single component of T₁ indicates
that the sample is homogeneous.

As seen in the figure, 1/T₁ shows a well-defined coherence
(Hebel-Slichter) peak just below T_(c), which is a characteristic of
superconductors with an isotropic gap. This is in sharp contrast to
various Fe pnictides reported so far.[4; 7; 15; 16; 17] At low
temperatures, 1/T₁ decreases as an exponential function of T. The solid
curves in Fig. 2 are calculations using the BCS model. The 1/T_(1S) in
the superconducting state is expressed as $\frac{T_{N}}{T_{1S}}$=
$\frac{2}{k_{B}T}\int(1+\frac{3^{2}}{k_{B}T})N_{c}(E)N_{c}(E^{\prime})f(E)[1-f(E ^{\prime})]\delta(E$
= E^(′))/dEdE^(′), where 1/T_(1S) is the relaxation rate in the normal
state, N_(c)(E) is the superconducting density of states (DOS), f(E) is
the Fermi distribution function, and C=$1+\frac{3}{k_{B}^{2}}$ is the
"coherence factor." Following Hebel,[26] we convolute N_(s)(E) with a
broadening function B(E) which is approximated with a rectangular
function centered at E with a height of 1/1.2δ. The solid curves below
T_(c) for the two samples shown in Fig. 2 are calculations with
2Δ(0)=3.2k_(B)T_(c) and r=Δ(0)/δ=5 for LaNiAsO_(0.90)F_(0.10) and
2Δ(0)=3.1k_(B)T_(c) and r=1.5 for LaNiAsO_(0.88)F_(0.12).

Such T dependence of 1/T₁ in the superconducting state is in striking
contrast to that for Fe pnictides where no co

symbols. Below T=10 K, 1/T₁T is constant for all F contents, indicating
weak electron correlations. The straight lines are guide to the eyes.
The curves for x=0.10 and 0.12 are fits to 1/T₁T =(1/T₁T₀)+b

  herence peak was observed and the \(T$ dependence at low T does not
show an exponential behavior. The striking difference may be ascribed to
the different topology of the Fermi surfaces. For Fe pnictides, it has
been proposed that d-wave[27; 28] or sign reversal s-wave gap[11; 12]
can be stabilized due to nesting by the connecting wave vector Q=(π, 0).
In LaNiAsO_(1 − x)F_(x), however, there is no such Fermi-surface
nesting,[25] and thus the mechanism for the proposed gap symmetry does
not exist. Our result therefore highlights the important role of the
Fermi-surface topology in the superconductivity of Fe pnictides.

Figure 3 shows the quantity 1/T₁T as a function of T. For x=0 and 0.06,
1/T₁T is a constant independent of T, which indicates that the electron
correlations are weak as in conventional metals. This feature is also in
striking contrast to the Fe analog. In LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x), a
magnetically ordered state is realized below T_(N)=140 K for x=0.[29]
For small x, 1/T₁T increases with decreasing T,[15] indicating electron
correlations as seen in high-T_(c) cuprates. The explanation based on
Fermi-surface nesting is a promising scenario to account for the
magnetic order.[11; 30] Fermi-surface nesting is also proposed to be
responsible for the spin fluctuations with Q =(π, 0).[11; 12] In
LaNiAsO_(1 − x)F_(x), however, such Fermi-surface nesting does not
exist, therefore the spin fluctuations are not expected. Thus, the
striking difference in the normal state between LaNiAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) and
LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) can also be understood by the different topology of
the Fermi surfaces.

On the other hand, for LaNiAsO_(0.06)F_(0.10) and
LaNiAsO_(0.08)F_(0.12), 1/T₁T increases with increasing T. A similar
feature was also seen in highly doped LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) with x≥ 0.1
(Refs. [6; 31; 32] and Ba(Fe_(0.9)Co_(0.1))₂As₂.[33] Clearly, such
behavior cannot be ascribed to electron correlations which are believed
to be responsible for a similar phenomenon in high-T_(c) cuprates
(called pseudogap).[34] It was proposed that such pseudogap behavior in
LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) is due to the band structure.[35] In
LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) with larger electron doping of x≥ 0.1, the large
DOS due to the hole pocket around the Γ^(′) point, namely (π, π), sinks
to below the Fermi level.[35; 36] At low T, this part of DOS does not
contribute to 1/T₁. Upon increasing T, however, the thermal activation
associated with such DOS will contribute to 1/T₁, giving rise to the
pseudogap behavior. At present, the origin for the pseudogap behavior in
LaNiAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) is unclear. But there is a good possibility that
the same mechanism[35] also applies. Upon doping, the bands around X and
R points in LaNiAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) (Ref. [25]) could sink to below the
Fermi level,[37] resulting in a pseudogap behavior similar to
LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) (x≥ 0.1). The ¹³⁹La Knight shift (K) shown in Fig.
4 supports such speculation since the spin part of K is proportional to
the DOS at the Fermi level [N(E_(F))] while 1/T₁T^(∞)N(E_(F))². The
curves for x=0.10 and 0.12 in Fig. 3 are fits to 1/T₁T=(1/T₁T₀)+b
exp(−2E_(x)/k_(B)T). The first term is proportional to N(E_(F))² at low
T and the second term comes from the thermal activation effect of the
DOS beneath the Fermi level. The obtained E_(x)/k_(B) is 22.5 K and 22 K
for x =0.10 and 0.12, respectively. The curve in Fig. 4 is a fit to
K=K₀+K₁ exp(−E_(x)/k_(B)T) with resulting E_(x)/k_(B)=23 K, in good
agreement with the 1/T₁T result. To conclude, the pseudogalgelike
behavior commonly seen in nickel and iron pnictides, in spite of
strikingly different T_(c), suggests that this feature is unrelated to
the mechanism of the superconductivity.

Figure 5 summarizes the results. Upon replacing O with F, the value of
(1/T₁T)₀ at low temperatures increases, indicating electron doping into
the system. This is also supported by the F-content dependence of v_(Q)
(middle panel) which is generally dominated by the on-site charge
distribution. The T_(c) initially increases upon doping but becomes less
x dependent beyond 0.06.[24] And most remarkably different, T_(c) is
smaller by nearly an order of magnitude compared to
LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x). If the superconductivity in LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x)
is promoted by the

level.

spin fluctuations with Q = (_p_, 0) as proposed, [11, 12] then the much
lower T_(c) in LaNiAsO1-xF1, can be naturally understood since such spin
fluctuation is not expected due to the different Fermi surface topology
and indeed is not observed experimentally.

In summary, we have presented the NQR and NMR results on the
electron-doped, low-_T__c_ nickel pnictides LaNiAsO1-xF1 (_x_ = 0, 0.06,
0.10, and 0.12). We find that the superconducting gap is fully opened on
the entire Fermi surface. Namely, the spin-lattice relaxation rate shows
a well-defined coherence peak just below T_(c) and decays exponentially
with further decreasing T. In the normal state, no antiferromagnetic
spin fluctuations were observed. These features are in striking contrast
with LaFeAsO1-xF1 where high-_T__c_ unusual superconductivity emerges in
a background of moderate antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation. All these
differences are understood by the different topology of the Fermi
surface for the two classes of materials. Our results highlight the
peculiarity and importance of the Fermi-surface topology in LaFeAsO1-xF1
and shed light on the mechanism of superconductivity and electron
correlations there.
