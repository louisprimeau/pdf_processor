###### Abstract

We report a 93Nb nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study on the noncentrosymmetric superconductor Re24Nb5. Below the superconducting temperature \(T_{c}(H)\), the spin susceptibility probed by the 93Nb NMR Knight shift gradually decreases with lowering temperature, accompanied by the broadening of the resonance spectrum. Such behavior is commonly observed in the BCS-type superconductors. The 93Nb NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/\(T_{1}\)) shows a well-defined coherence peak just below \(T_{c}(H)\), followed by a marked decrease with further decreasing temperature. Moreover, the 1/\(T_{1}\) data in the superconducting state were found to obey a single exponential expression, yielding a nodeless gap \(\Delta/k_{B}\) = 10.3 K. This value gives the ratio of 2\(\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}(H)\) = 3.55, that is almost identical with the value of 3.5 predicted from BCS theory. On these bases, we conclude that the noncentrosymmetric Re24Nb5 compound can be characterized as a weakly coupled BCS-type superconductor.

## I Introduction

There is general agreement from intense experimental and theoretical research that the antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling (ASOC) will be enhanced in the superconducting (SC) materials where the atomic sites have a lack of spatial inversion symmetry.[1, 2, 3, 4] Such enhancement would lead to the lifting of spin degeneracy and the splitting of the energy bands. Consequently, the superconducting order parameter does not have definite parity but may appear as a mixture of the spin-singlet and spin-triplet states.[1, 2, 3, 4] Superconductors, such as CePt\({}_{3}\)Si, Mg\({}_{12}\)Ir\({}_{19}\)B\({}_{15}\), Li\({}_{2}\)Pt\({}_{3}\)B, Re\({}_{3}\)W, Mo\({}_{3}\)Al\({}_{2}\)C, CaIrSi\({}_{3}\), etc.,[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] have been reported to possess noncentrosymmetric characteristics. Among these rare-earth and transition metal based noncentrosymmetric superconductors, the _d_-electron systems are more suitable for exploring the issue of inversion symmetry breaking because the strong electron correlations in _f_-electron contained materials usually complicate the superconducting properties.

Re24Nb5, although its superconductivity was discovered four decades ago,[14, 15] has been recognized as a noncentrosymmetric superconductor based on the recent study of the nearly stoichiometric compound Re0.82Nb0.18 (equivalent to Re23.8Nb5.2) by Karki and coworkers.[16] This material crystallizes in the Re24Ti5-type structure with the space group \(I\bar{4}3m\) (No. 217). Within this crystal structure, there are two nonequivalent crystallographic niobium sites and two rhenium sites in Re24Nb5. Among them, only the Nb(1) site (2\(a\) in Wyckoff notation) displays an inversion center. Since the Re atom is a heavy element, the effect of ASOC is expected to be strong in Re24Nb5. This would provide an opportunity for the searching for the existence of a mixture of the spin-singlet and spin-triplet states in the SC phase of this compound.

In this Brief Report, we present the results of a 93Nb nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study in the normal and superconducting states of Re24Nb5. The spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/\(T_{1}\)) data were found to exhibit a constant \(T_{1}T\) relationship in the normal state and a rapid decrease in the SC state, accompanied by the presence of a distinct coherence peak just below the SC transition temperature \(T_{c}(H)\). These observations are in agreement with an _s_-wave model with a single nodeless gap \(\Delta/k_{B}\simeq 10.3\) K. This result yields 2\(\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}(H)\) = 3.55, almost identical with the BCS value of 3.5, suggesting a weakly coupled BCS-type superconductivity for Re24Nb5.

## II Experimental results and discussion

A nominally stoichiometric Re24Nb5 sample was prepared from 99.997% Re and 99.95% Nb by mixing appropriate amounts of elemental metals. They were placed in a water-cooled copper crucible and then were melted several times in an Ar arc-melting furnace. The resulting ingot was annealed in a vacuum-sealed quartz tube at 800 degC for 5 days, followed by furnace cooling. A room-temperature x-ray diffraction taken with Cu \(K_{\alpha}\) radiation on the powdered sample is shown in Fig. 1. It is seen that the diffraction spectrum in this material was identical to the expected Re24Ti5-type structure. In a more detailed analysis of the x-ray data, the \(I\bar{4}3m\) phase was refined with the Rietveld method. We thus extracted the lattice constant \(a\) = 9.6076 A for our Re24Nb5. This value is a bit smaller than that of Re23.8Nb5.2 (\(a\) = 9.6293 A),[16] in agreement with the fact that Nb has a larger atomic size than Re.

DC magnetization \(M\) measurements were carried out using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer measured at a field \(H_{o}\) = 10 Oe under zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) processes. The temperature dependence of \(M/H_{o}\) for Re24Nb5 is illustrated in Fig. 2. The observed diamagnetic behavior below the transition temperature \(T_{c}\simeq 8.7\) K confirms the occurrence of superconductivity in this material. Here \(T_{c}\) was defined as the onset of the diamagnetic response in the magnetization data, as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 2. It is worthwhile mentioning that we prepared several specimens with slight excess Nb and Re concentrations from the stoichiometry but found minor changes on the value of \(T_{c}\). Such an observation is consistent with the reported result by Karki _et al.[16]_

NMR measurements were performed using a Varian 300 spectrometer with a constant field of 6.94 T. The magnitude of \(T_{c}\) is reduced to \(T_{c}(H)\) = 5.8 K by such of the external field employed in our NMR experiment. The specimen was put in a plastic vial that showed no observable \({}^{93}\)Nb NMR signal.\({}^{17}\) The \({}^{93}\)Nb NMR central transition lines were obtained by the Fourier transform of a half of the spin-echo signal using a standard \(\pi/2-\tau-\pi\) sequence. Within the Re\({}_{24}\)Ti\({}_{5}\)-type crystal structure, there are two crystallographic Nb sites, Nb(1) and Nb(2), with population ratio of 1:4. Hence, the observed \({}^{93}\)Nb NMR line shape is mainly featured by the Nb(2) site while a small hump at the higher frequency could be associated with Nb(1). Several representative spectra taken below and above 5.8 K are displayed in Fig. 3. It is apparent that the resonance line becomes broad below \(T_{c}(H)\), typical behavior due to a spatial field modulation in the mixed state of type-II superconductors. In the inset of Fig. 4, we presented the temperature variation of the line width \(\Delta\nu\), estimated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the main line.

The observed temperature-dependent \({}^{93}\)Nb Knight shift (\({}^{93}K\)) of Re\({}_{24}\)Nb\({}_{5}\) is given in Fig. 4. Here \({}^{93}K\) was evaluated from the position of the maximum of each spectrum with respect to an aqueous KNbO\({}_{6}\) solution reference.\({}^{18}\) Note that the error bars here were taken as the accuracy for the determination of the maximum. The obtained \({}^{93}K\) is positive and shows temperature independence in a normal state, being consistent with the Pauli-type paramagnetic nature for Re\({}_{24}\)Nb\({}_{5}\). The large positive \({}^{93}K\) value of about 0.41% is mainly associated with the orbital shift. Below \(T_{c}(H)\), \({}^{93}K\) shifts to higher frequencies, indicating that the niobium \(d\) electrons play an important role for the reduction of the electronic density of states (DOS) due to the onset of superconductivity since the hyperfine field associated with the core polarization via 4\(d\) electrons is negative.\({}^{19-21}\) While associating the frequency shift with specific electronic changes is usually complicated by undistinguished \(s\)-electron, core polarization, quadrupolar, and orbital terms, the spin-lattice relaxation rate is comparatively simple due to the domination

  by core polarization, thus providing a directly quantitative probe of electronic DOS changes.

The spin-lattice relaxation time \(T_{1}\) measurement was carried out using the inversion recovery method. We recorded the signal strength by integrating the recovered spin echo signal. In these experiments, the relaxation process involves the adjacent pairs of spin levels, and the corresponding \(T_{1}\) is a multiexponential expression.[22] For the central transition with \(I=\frac{9}{2}\), the recovery of the nuclear magnetization \(m\) follows

\[\frac{m(t)-m(\infty)}{m(\infty)} = -2\alpha\big{(}0.152e^{-\frac{t}{T_{1}}}+0.14e^{-\frac{\theta}{T_ {1}}}+0.153e^{-\frac{15}{T_{1}}}\] (1) \[\mbox{}+0.192e^{-\frac{2\theta}{T_{1}}}+0.363e^{-\frac{4\theta}{T _{1}}}\big{)}.\]

Here \(m(t)\) is the magnetization at the recovery time \(t\), and \(m(\infty)\) is the magnetization after a long time recovery. The parameter \(\alpha\) is a fractional value derived from the initial conditions used in our experiments. Each \(T_{1}\) value was thus obtained by fitting to this multiexponential recovery curve. The observed temperature dependence of \(1/T_{1}\) for Re\({}_{24}\)Nb\({}_{5}\) is depicted in Fig. 5.

Above 5.8 K, \(1/T_{1}\) obeys the Korringa relation with a constant \(T_{1}T=14.6\) s K. A well-defined coherence peak (Hebel-Slichter peak)[23] appears just below \(T_{c}(H)\), followed by a marked decrease down to 2.6 K. These characteristics are commonly observed within the BCS-type superconductors. In the inset of Fig. 5, we plotted \(1/T_{1}T\) as a function of the normalized temperature \(T/T_{c}(H)\), showing a more pronounced peak feature around \(T_{c}(H)\). It is known that the temperature variation of \(1/T_{1}\) in the SC state is related to the SC gap structure. Evidently, the \(1/T_{1}\) data can be fitted well to a single exponential expression from \(0.82T_{c}(H)\) to \(0.45T_{c}(H)\), yielding the magnitude of the SC gap \(\Delta/k_{B}=10.3\) K. This value gives the ratio of \(2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}(H)=3.55\) which is similar to the value of 3.67 obtained from the analysis of the electronic heat capacity in Re\({}_{0.82}\)Nb\({}_{0.18}\).[16] In addition, this result is also comparable to those in other fully gapped noncentrosymmetric superconductors such as 3.52 for Re\({}_{3}\)W and 3.59 for Mg\({}_{10}\)Ir\({}_{19}\)B\({}_{16}\).[24, 10]

As the SC gap possesses line nodes, the \(T\)-dependent \(1/T_{1}\) is expected to obey \(T^{3}\) behavior below \(T_{c}(H)\) and exhibits no Hebel-Slichter peak at around \(T_{c}(H)\). However, our \(1/T_{1}\) reveals a distinct coherence peak near \(T_{c}(H)\) followed by an exponential decay in Re\({}_{24}\)Nb\({}_{5}\). Moreover, the revealed \(2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}(H)=3.55\) is almost identical with the BCS value of 3.5, suggesting that Re\({}_{24}\)Nb\({}_{5}\) is a weakly coupled \(s\)-wave superconductor. Hence, the NMR observation tends to indicate that the effect of the ASOC is quite weak in the current case of Re\({}_{24}\)Nb\({}_{5}\). This result is very likely due to a small band splitting lifted by ASOC as compared to the relatively high transition temperature \(T_{c}\simeq 8.7\) K for Re\({}_{24}\)Nb\({}_{5}\). On the other hand, Mineev and Samokhin have argued that the effects of nonmagnetic impurities on noncentrosymmetric superconductors may lead to an inevitable consequence of the band splitting even though the intrinsic ASOC is stronger than SC energy scales.[25] If such an extrinsic effect appears in our sample, it might mask the underlying SC gap anisotropy in the present Re\({}_{24}\)Nb\({}_{5}\). In this respect, a further investigation of a single crystal Re\({}_{24}\)Nb\({}_{5}\) is highly desirable for solving this puzzle.

## III Conclusions

The SC characteristics of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor Re\({}_{24}\)Nb\({}_{5}\) have been investigated through \({}^{93}\)Nb NMR measurements. The important findings are that the spin-lattice relaxation rate of Re\({}_{24}\)Nb\({}_{5}\) exhibits a coherence peak just below \(T_{c}(H)\) and its temperature dependence can be described by means of the \(s\)-wave BCS model. We also commented that the invisible mixture of the spin-singlet and spin-triplet states in the SC phase of this compound could be attributed to its relatively high transition temperature. However, the possible suppression of the ASOC by impurities and/or disorder should not be ruled out as using a polycrystalline Re\({}_{24}\)Nb\({}_{5}\).
