###### Abstract

Magnetic measurements on optimally doped single crystals of
BaFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂ (x≈ 0.35) with magnetic fields applied along
different crystallographic axes were performed under pressure, enabling
the pressure evolution of coherence lengths and the anisotropy factor to
be followed. Despite a decrease in the superconducting critical
temperature, our studies reveal that the superconducting properties
become more anisotropic under pressure. With appropriate scaling, we
directly compare these properties with the values obtained for
BaFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂ as a function of phosphorus content.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in iron-based compounds has triggered
intense experimental and theoretical investigations.[1] One of the most
heavily studied families is the so called 122 iron arsenides (MFe₂As₂,
where M = Ca, Sr, Ba, and Eu), where the ground state can be tuned from
a spin density wave (SDW) to superconductivity by charge doping [2, 3]
or pressure.[4, 5] For example, superconductivity in BaFe₂As₂ can be
induced by hole doping,[2] electron doping,[6] isoelectronic
substitution,[7] and external physical pressure.[4]

The availability of high-quality BaFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂ single crystals
has enabled detailed investigations of the charge and spin dynamics
spanning the entire phase diagram. The SDW state is suppressed for x≥
0.27 and superconductivity is observed for 0.14≤x≤ 0.71, where a maximum
superconducting critical temperature, T_(c), of ∼31 K is seen at x∼
0.3.[7, 8] Quantum oscillation experiments revealed the existence of big
Fermi surface sheets at the overdoped side (x> 0.33).[9] In contrast,
small Fermi pockets were detected in the parent compound of MFe₂As₂.[10,
11] In addition, an enhancement of the quasiparticle effective mass,
m^(*), was observed by quantum oscillations at the overdoped side on
approaching the SDW state.[9] On the other hand, nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) measurements on the same part of the phase diagram
reported a drastic enhancement of two-dimensional antiferromagnetic
fluctuations on approaching the SDW state.[12] Taking these experiments
together as well as various anomalous transport properties,[7] it is
evidenced that the BaFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂ system features an
antiferromagnetic quantum critical point at x∼ 0.33.

Apart from the interesting normal state properties mentioned above, the
superconducting properties for x = 0.33 also exhibit anomalous behavior.
In particular, careful analysis of the temperature dependence of thermal
conductivity,[13] magnetic penetration depth,[13] and NMR spin-lattice
relaxation rate[14] suggests the presence of line nodes in the
superconducting gap.

The layered structure of the 122 systems naturally raises the question
regarding the anisotropy of physical properties. The ability to apply
magnetic field along both the ab plane and the c axis offers an
excellent opportunity to study the anisotropy of superconducting
properties under pressure. Here we report magnetic measurements for
single crystals with x≈ 0.35 under hydrostatic pressure.

## II Experimental

High-pressure experiments were performed using a Moissanite anvil cell
on high-quality x≈ 0.35 single crystals grown in Kyoto. The anvil cell
is cylindrical with a diameter of 18 mm and a length of 40 mm, and can
be rotated with respect to the magnetic field axis for anisotropy
studies. Single crystals used for this study were grown from mixtures of
FeAs, Fe, P (powders) and Ba (flakes) placed in an alumina crucible,
sealed in an evacuated quartz tube and kept at 1150 ^(∘)C−1200 ^(∘)C for
12 h, followed by a slow cooling to 900 ^(∘)C at the rate of 1.5
^(∘)C/h.[15] X-ray diffraction studies established the lattice constants
to be a = 3.9266(12) and c = 12.8271(59), and the z coordinate of
pnictogen atoms in the unit cell is z= 0.35233(46), giving the
phosphorus fraction of x≈ 0.35. In addition, energy-dispersive x-ray
spectroscopy established the variation in x from sample to sample to be
less than 2

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1 presents the temperature dependence of the resonant frequency
at different magnetic fields for H∥ab plane [Fig. 1(a)] and H∥c axis
[Fig. 1(b)], for x≈ 0.35 pressurized

to 21.5 kbar. The transition to the superconducting state, manifested by
an increase in the resonant frequency, is clearly observed. The
superconducting critical temperature, T_(c), at zero field and ambient
pressure determined by this technique (not shown) is 30.5 K, which is in
good agreement with the T_(c) measured by the mutual inductance method
(see the inset of Fig. 3) and resistivity measurements reported
elsewhere.[7] This value of T_(c) confirms that x = 0.35 is at the
optimal doping of the BaFe₂(As¹⁻Pt)₂ system. The superconducting
transition, which is still very sharp at 21.5 kbar, demonstrates the
high quality of the crystals and pressure transmitting fluid used in
this study.

The superconducting transition with magnetic field applied shows a very
distinct behavior for different field orientations. As evidenced in Fig.
1, T_(c) is depressed at a faster rate for H∥c axis. The T_(c) values
extracted at high fields are presented in Fig. 2 for ambient pressure,
9.4 and 21.5 kbar. With increasing pressure, the rate of change of T_(c)
with field remains more or less constant for H∥ab plane whereas for H∥c
axis, this rate increases strongly. Interestingly, high pressure
resistivity studies on the optimally electron-doped Ba(Fe¹⁻Co₃)₂As₂
(Ref. [19]) and hole-doped Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ (Ref. [20]) with H∥c
revealed only a small variation in the rate of change of T_(c). Thus,
the BaFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂ system at optimal doping is rather special
and we now extract anisotropic superconducting and normal state
properties under pressure.

Apart from a slight curvature very near T_(c) which has also been
observed by other groups (see, e.g., Ref. [21]), the variation of T_(c)
over our accessible field range is very linear. Equivalently, the
initial slope of the H_(c2)-T curves is approximately constant over the
field range of 13 T. For ambient pressure data,
(dH_(c2)^(ab)/dT)|_(T_(c)) ∼ -2.41 T/K and (dH_(c2)^(c)/dT)|_(T_(c))∼
-1.67 T/K for field along the ab plane and c axis, respectively.
According to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH)
prescription,[22]H_(c2)(T → 0) = -0.697_(c)(dH_(c2)/dT)|_(T_(c)), giving
H_(c2)^(ab)(0) ∼ 50.7 T and H_(c2)^(c)(0) ∼ 35.1 T. We note that a
similar WHH treatment by Chong _et al.[8]_ based on resistivity data on
BaFe₂(As_(0.68)P_(0.32)) gives similar H_(c2)^(c)(0) ∼ 36.4 T but higher
H_(c2)^(ab)(0) ∼ 77.4 T. In addition, Hashimoto _et al.[13]_ reported
H_(c2)^(c)(0) ∼ 51.5 T based on specific-heat and torque magnetometry
measurements on BaFe₂(As_(0.67)P_(0.33))₂.

The anisotropy factor γ is defined as H_(c2)^(ab)/H_(c2)^(c), which for
the same T_(c) reduces to the ratio of the initial slopes
(dH_(c2)^(ab)/dT)|_(T_(c))/(dH_(c2)^(c)/dT)|_(T_(c)). As tabulated in
Table 1, the pressure dependence of γ is remarkable: relative to ambient
pressure, γ increases by more than a factor of 2 at 21.5 kbar despite a
decreasing T_(c). Since glycerin is hydrostatic at this pressure range,
if we assume the anisotropy of superconducting properties is directly
coupled to the anisotropy of the crystal lattice, it is tempting to
conclude that the crystal lattice is more compressible along the ab
direction. However, neutron diffraction experiments performed on
BaFe₂As₂ up to 60 kbar detected only minor changes in the lattice
constants over the entire pressure range.[23] Furthermore, the neutron
result showed that the c axis is slightly _more_ compressible than the
ab direction. For the heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn₅, the
anisotropy factor determined from the initial slopes decreases under
pressure.[24] This is accompanied by an initial increase in T_(c), which
peaks at 13 kbar. Furthermore, even more drastic behavior is seen in
CeCu₂Si₂: the anisotropy factor crosses γ=1 under pressure while T_(c)
increases strongly from 0.68 K at ambient pressure (γ=1.24) to 1.62 K at
24.2 kbar (γ=0.87).[25]

state value of ∼12 MHz.

The Ginzburg-Landau coherence length along the two principal axes can be
calculated from the set of equations [26]

ξ_(ab)² = Φ₀/2 πH_(c2)^(c),
(1)

ξ_(ab)ξ_(c) = Φ₀/2 πH_(c2)^(ab),
(2)

where Φ₀=2.07 × 10⁻¹⁵ Wb is the flux quantum. High-pressure neutron
diffraction [23] found that the c axis lattice constant decreases
linearly by merely 2

−0.15 K/kbar for the optimally hole-doped Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ (Ref.
[20]) but slower than that for the optimally electron-doped
Ba(Fe_(0.926)Co_(0.074))₂As₂ (roughly −0.25 K/bar).[19] At 37 kbar, the
transition is slightly broadened, possibly due to the inhomogeneity of
the pressure transmitting fluid at this pressure. The fact that T_(c) is
depressed rather slowly and is still so high at 37 kbar is remarkable.
This is to be contrasted to Alireza _et al._’s observation[4] on
BaFe₂As₂, where T_(c) above ∼40 kbar is depressed rapidly with pressure,
but remains rather constant above ∼50 kbar.

The birth of superconductivity in the BaFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂ system has
been understood in terms of chemical pressure exerted by phosphorus
substitution. Comparing the initial slope of $T_{\rm SDW}$ as a function
of pressure[32] against that for BaFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂ at low
phosphorus content x,[7] we estimate that 1

The dHvA experiment on BaFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂ (Ref. [9]) allows the
calculation of v_(F)(x) from the dHvA frequency via the Onsager
relation.[33] Since for the dHvA experiment the magnetic field is
applied along the c axis, the in-plane coherence length, ξ_(ab), can be
extracted using the BCS theory discussed above. The value of the
numerical constant a^(⋆) for Δ(0) depends on the nodal structure of the
gap as well as the dimensionality of the system.[26; 34] For our
analysis, we take a^(⋆)∼ 2. Figure 3(a) shows the x dependence of ξ_(ab)
plotted on the same graph as ξ_(ab) and ξ_(c) under pressure, using the
same pressure-phosphorus content scaling relation. Interestingly, taking
into account only the Fermi velocity of the β band, an electron band at
the Brillouin-zone corner, a smooth overall variation in ξ_(ab)(p) and
ξ_(ab)(x) is observed. For a multiband system, the transition to the
superconducting state is governed by the band with the shortest
coherence length. Given that the band with the larger effective mass and
the larger gap gives the shortest coherence length, this comparative
study strongly suggests that the β band might also have a larger gap, in
addition to the large effective mass already observed.[9]

## IV Conclusions

In summary, we have studied the effect of pressure on the
superconducting properties of optimally doped BaFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂
with x = 0.35. We find that T_(c) is suppressed rather slowly under
pressure and remains as high as 19.4 K at 37 kbar. The coupling between
superconducting layers becomes progressively weakened under pressure and
the anisotropy in the superconducting properties _increases_ with
applied pressure, which might be due to an increase in the anisotropy of
the superconducting gap. The effective mass associated with the in-plane
charge dynamics _reduces_ at higher pressures. With appropriate scaling,
the pressure dependence of the superconducting properties agrees nicely
with the x dependence of the same properties for
BaFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂. The β band is likely to play a prominent role
in determining the superconducting and thermodynamic properties of this
system.
