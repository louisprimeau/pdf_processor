8 December 2008  low superconducting transition temperature that is desirable in investigating the normal-state behavior with suppressed thermal broadening of photoemission spectra. The samples are cleaved _in situ_ in vacuum with a base pressure better than \(4\times 10^{-11}\) Torr.

Figure 1(a) shows the Fermi-surface mapping of the optimally doped La-Bi2201 (\(T_{c}\)=32 K) measured at 15 K. The low photon energy and high photon flux have made it possible to take dense sampling of the measurements in the momentum space. The photoemission spectra [energy distribution curves (EDCs)] along the Fermi surface are plotted in Fig. 1(b). The EDCs near the nodal region show sharp peaks that are similar to those observed in Bi2212.[21] When the momentum moves away from the nodal region to the \((0,\pi)\) antinodal region, the EDC peaks get weaker, but peak feature remains along the entire Fermi surface even for the one close to the antinodal region. The EDC peak position also shifts away from the Fermi level when the momentum moves from the nodal to the antinodal region, indicating a gap opening in the superconducting state. Note that the EDCs near the antinodal region do not show any feature near 40 meV that was reported in a previous measurement.[14]

In order to extract the energy gap, we have symmetrized the original EDCs with respect to the Fermi level, as shown in Fig. 1(c) for the 15 K measurements, and Fig. 1(d) and Figs. 1(e) and 1(f) for 25 and 40 K, respectively. The symmetrization procedure not only provides an intuitive way in visualizing the energy gap, but also removes the effect of Fermi cutoff in photoemission spectra and provides a quantitative way in extracting the gap size.[22] The symmetrized EDCs have been fitted using the general phenomenological form;[22] the fitted curves are overlaid in Figs. 1(c)-1(f) and the extracted gap size is plotted in Fig. 2.

As shown in Fig. 2, the gap in the superconducting state exhibits a clear anisotropic behavior that is consistent with a standard \(d\)-wave form \(\Delta\)=\(\Delta_{0}\cos(2\Phi)\) [or in a more strict sense, \(\Delta\)=\(\Delta_{0}|\cos(k_{x}a)-\cos(k_{y}a)|/2\) form as shown in the inset of Fig. 2] with a maximum energy gap \(\Delta_{0}\)=15.5 meV. It is also interesting to note that the gap is nearly identical for the 15 and 25 K measurements for such a \(T_{c}\)=32 K superconductor. These results are significantly different from a recent measurement where the gap in the superconducting state deviates strongly from the standard \(d\)-wave form with

The solid red line is fitted from the measured data at 15 K which gives \(\Delta\) =15.5 \(\cos(2\Phi)\). The \(\Phi\) angle is defined as shown in the bottom-right inset. The upper-right inset shows the gap size as a function of \(|\cos(k_{x}a)-\cos(k_{x}a)|/2\) at 15 and 25 K. The pink line represents a fitted line with \(\Delta\)=15.5\(|\cos(k_{x}a)-\cos(k_{y}a)|/2\).

  an antinodal gap at 40 meV.[14] An earlier measurement[23] gave an antinodal gap at 10-12 meV, which is close to our present measurement, but it also reported strong deviation from the standard \(d\)-wave form. While the non-\(d\)-wave energy gap can be interpreted as composed of two components in the previous measurement,[14] our present results clearly indicate that the gap in the superconducting state is dominated by a \(d\)-wave component.

In the normal state above \(T_{c}\)=32 K, the Fermi surface measured at 40 K is still gapped over a large portion except for the section near the nodal region that shows a zero gap, as seen from the symmetrized EDCs [Figs. 1(e) and 1(f) for 40 K] and the extracted pseudogap (40 K data in Fig. 2). This is consistent with the "Fermi arc" picture observed in other high-temperature superconductors.[6, 11, 24] Note that the pseudogap outside of the "Fermi arc" region shows similar magnitude and momentum dependence as the gap in the superconducting state (Fig. 2).

Figure 3 shows detailed temperature dependence of EDCs and the associated energy gap for two representative momenta on the Fermi surface. Strong temperature dependence of the EDCs is observed for the Fermi momentum A [Fig. 3(a)]. At high temperatures such as 100 K or above, the EDCs show a broad hump structure near \(-0.2\) eV with no observable peak near the Fermi level. Upon cooling, the high-energy \(-0.2\) eV broad hump shows little change with temperature, while a new structure emerges near the Fermi level and develops into a sharp "quasiparticle" peak in the superconducting state, giving rise to a peak-dip-hump structure in EDCs. This temperature evolution and peak-dip-hump structure are reminiscent to that observed in other high-temperature superconductors such as Bi2212.[25] When moving toward the antinodal region, as for the Fermi momentum B [Fig. 3(b)], the EDCs qualitatively show similar behavior although the temperature effect gets much weaker. One can still see a weak peak developed at low temperatures, e.g., 13 K, near the Fermi level.

To examine the evolution of the energy gap with temperature, Figs. 3(c) and 3(d) show symmetrized EDCs measured at different temperatures for the Fermi momenta A and B, respectively. The gap sizes extracted by fitting the symmetrized EDCs with the general formula[22] are plotted in Fig. 4. For the Fermi momentum A, as seen from Fig. 3(c), signature of gap opening in the superconducting state persists above \(T_{c}\)=32 K, remaining obvious at 50 K, getting less clear at 75 K, and appear to disappear around 100 K and above as evidenced by the appearance of a broad peak. The gap size below 50 K (Fig. 4) shows little change with temperature and no abrupt change is observed across \(T_{c}\). The data at 75 K are hard to fit to get a reliable gap size, thus not included in Fig. 4. When the momentum moves closer to the antinodal region, as for the Fermi momentum B, similar behaviors are observed, i.e., below 50 K, the gap size is nearly a constant without an abrupt change near \(T_{c}\). But in this case, different from the Fermi momentum A, there is no broad peak recovered above 100 K, probably indicating a higher pseudogap temperature. This is qualitatively consistent with the transport[26] and NMR (Ref. [27]) measurements on the same material that give a pseudogap temperature between 100-150 K.

From precise gap measurement, there are clear signatures that can distinguish between "one-gap" and "two-gap" scenarios.[4] In the "two-gap" picture where the pseudogap and superconducting gap are assumed independent, because

The location of the Fermi momenta is indicated in the inset. Detailed temperature dependence of the symmetrized EDCs for the Fermi momentum A are shown in (c) and for the Fermi momentum B in (d). The dashed lines in (c) and (d) serve as a guide for the eyes.

  the superconducting gap opens below \(T_{c}\)_in addition to_ the pseudogap that already opens in the normal state and persists into the superconducting state, one would expect to observe two effects: (1) Deviation of the energy gap from a standard \(d\)-wave form in the superconducting state with a possible break in the measured gap form;[14] (2) Outside of the "Fermi arc" region, one should expect to see an increase in gap size in the superconducting state. Our observations of standard \(d\)-wave form in the superconducting state (Fig. 2), similar magnitude and momentum dependence of the pseudogap and the gap in the superconducting state outside of the "Fermi arc" region (Fig. 2), smooth evolution of the gap size across \(T_{c}\) and no indication of gap size increase upon entering the superconducting state (Fig. 4), are not compatible with the expectations of the "two-gap" picture. They favor the "one-gap" picture where the pseudogap and superconducting gap are closely related and the pseudogap transforms into the superconducting gap across \(T_{c}\). Note that, although the region outside of the "Fermi arc" shows little change in the gap size with temperature (Fig. 4), the EDCs exhibit strong temperature dependence with a "quasiparticle" peak developed in the superconducting state [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)] that can be related with the establishment of phase coherence.[8, 25] This suggests that the pseudogap region on the Fermi surface can sense the occurrence of superconductivity through acquiring phase coherence.

In conclusion, from our precise measurements on the detailed momentum and temperature dependence of the energy gap in optimally doped La-Bi2201, we provide clear evidence to show that the pseudogap and superconducting gap are intimately related. Our observations are in favor of the "one-gap" picture that the pseudogap is a precursor to the superconducting gap and superconductivity is realized by establishing a phase coherence.
