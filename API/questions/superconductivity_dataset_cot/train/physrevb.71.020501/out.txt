###### Abstract

We report data on the thermal conductivity \kappa(T,H) in the basal plane of hexagonal single crystalline and superconducting Mg(B_{1-\tau}C_{\tau})_{2} (\kappa=0.03, 0.06) at temperatures between 0.5 and 50 K, and in external magnetic fields H between 0 and 50 K. The substitution of carbon for boron leads to a considerable reduction of the electronic heat transport, while the phonon thermal conductivity seems to be much less sensitive to impurities. The introduction of carbon enhances mostly the intraband scattering in the \sigma band. In contrast to the previously observed anomalous behavior of pure MgB_{2}, the Wiedemann-Franz law is valid for Mg(B_{0.94}C_{0.06})_{2} at low temperatures.

 magnetic field below about 5-10 kOe, but in higher fields, the \kappa values for H\parallelc exceed those for H\perpc significantly (see the upper row in Fig. 2). For the carbon-doped samples, \kappa(H) depends only weakly on the field orientation in all fields. Another striking observation across the entire covered temperature range is the much weaker field-induced enhancement of \kappa for the carbon-doped samples than for pure MgB_{2}. At temperatures above about 5 K and for x=0.03 and x =0.06, no field-induced enhancement of \kappa is observed at all, whereas for x=0, it persists at all temperatures up to T_{c} (see the lower row in Fig. 2).

The \kappa(H) curves allow to establish the values of the bulk upper critical field H_{c2} via the onset of the field independence of \kappa(H) (see arrows in Fig. 2). The resulting H_{c2}(T) data are shown in Fig. 3. They are in agreement with results of torque measurements on similar samples.[12]

The zero-field electrical resistivity for the x=0.06 sample was measured between 4.2 and 130 K. The transition at T_{c} =32.9 K is, with a width of about 0.1 K, rather narrow. In the entire covered temperature range above T_{c}, \rho(T) is well described by \rho=\rho_{0}+\sigmaT^{3} (see the inset in Fig. 1) where two scattering processes, associated with quasiparticle scattering by defects and phonons, respectively, are considered. The constant parameters are \rho_{0}=12.3 \mu\Omega cm and a=5.4 \times 10^{-7}\mu\Omega cm K^{-3}. In comparison, for pure MgB_{2}, \rho_{0} =2.0 \mu\Omega cm and a=6.7 \times 10^{-7}\mu\Omega cm K^{-3} (Ref. [19]), which demonstrates that carbon doping strongly enhances the scattering by defects, while the electron-phonon scattering is only weakly altered.

Because we assume that the transport is provided by itinerant electronic (\kappa_{c}) and lattice excitations (\kappa_{\rm ph}), such that \kappa= \kappa_{c}+ \kappa_{\rm ph}, any analysis of the changes of \kappa(T,H) caused by the substitution of carbon for boron should consider corresponding changes in both these channels. In MgB_{2}, the electronic thermal conduction consists of contributions from both the \sigma and the \pi band, hence \kappa_{c}= \kappa_{c,\sigma}+ \kappa_{c,\pi}.[21, 22, 23, 24] When the temperature is reduced to below T_{c} in zero magnetic field, the continuous reduction of the number of unpaired quasiparticles leads to a decrease of \kappa_{c} but, because of the reduction of the scattering of phonons by electrons (holes), also to an increase of \kappa_{\rm ph}. Altogether, the features of \kappa(T) depend on the relative magnitudes of \kappa_{c} and \kappa_{\rm ph} and on the efficiency of phonon scattering by electrons. Since for MgB_{2} the energy gap in the \pi band at a given normalized temperature T/T_{c} is considerably smaller than expected from the BCS theory, the \pi-band contributions to both the heat transport and the phonon scattering extend to lower temperatures than in conventional superconductors. Nevertheless, both \kappa_{c,\sigma} and \kappa_{c,\pi} are negligible at very low temperatures and H= 0. Below 2-3 K, the observed \kappa(T,0) varies approximately as T^{3} (see dashed line in Fig. 1), which is expected for purely phononic conductivity and a dominant scattering of phonons at the sample boundaries. The observation that the \kappa(T,0) curves tend to merge below T_{c} suggests that carbon doping does not influence the thermal conduction via phonons very much, and that the difference in \kappa(T,0) observed at higher temperatures

  results from \kappa_{e} being considerably reduced by the introduction of carbon for boron. The question of which band is more strongly influenced by doping, can be answered by analyzing the \kappa(H) data in the mixed state.

The quasiparticles associated with the vortices provide additional scattering of phonons and also enhance \kappa_{e}. The competition of these two mechanisms results in typical \kappa(H) curves for type-II superconductors, with an initial drop of \kappa when H is raised to above H_{c1} and subsequently to a considerable increase when H approaches H_{c2}. For MgB_{2}, this rather gradual increase of \kappa_{e}(H) is replaced by an extremely rapid increase of \kappa_{e} at fields H{\ll}H_{c2}, followed by a saturation region and yet another increase in the vicinity of H_{c2}.[19] The low-field increase does not scale with H/H_{c2} as is observed for conventional superconductors and is almost independent of field orientation, despite the strong anisotropy of H_{c2}. This unique behavior is explained in terms of a two-band scenario, where the smaller energy gap \Delta_{\pi} is closed at a relatively low and weakly anisotropic field H_{\pi}^{*}{<}H_{c2}, of the order of 10 kOe for pure MgB_{2}.[25, 26, 27] Therefore, \kappa_{e,\pi} increases rapidly when the field approaches H_{\pi}^{*} and, still in the mixed state, adopts its normal-state value above H_{\pi}^{*}. The \sigma-band contribution \kappa_{e,\sigma} only grows when H approaches H_{c2}, the enhancement being strongly anisotropic, reflecting the anisotropy of H_{c2}.

The striking difference between carbon-free and carbon-doped samples is that, for the latter, no significant increase in \kappa(H) is observed in the vicinity of H_{c2}. It implies that \kappa_{e,\sigma} is strongly reduced by carbon substitution from about 50% of the total normal state \kappa_{e} for x{=}0 (Ref. [19]) to a level close to our experimental resolution for x{=}0.03. Hence, the quasiparticle contribution to the heat transport is dominated by the \pi band, i.e., \kappa_{e}{\approx}\,\kappa_{e,\pi}. Carbon doping also reduces \kappa_{e,\pi} but less severely than \kappa_{e,\sigma}. At 1.0 K and in a field H\perp c=45 kOe, the thermal conductivity for the x{=}0.06 sample is a factor of 11 smaller than for pure MgB_{2}. Since at such low temperatures and high fields \kappa_{\rm ph} is rather small, this reduction is obviously due to the carbon-doping-induced reduction of \kappa_{e,\pi}. The quasiparticle thermal conductivity is given by \kappa_{e}{=}C_{\sigma}v_{F}\ell/3, where C_{e} is the electronic specific heat, v_{F} the Fermi velocity, and \ell the mean-free path. If we assume that by carbon doping at the 6% level neither the electronic density of states at the Fermi level N_{\pi}(E_{F}){\approx}\,C_{e,\pi} nor the Fermi velocity v_{F,\pi} in the \pi band are much altered, then the reduction of \kappa_{e,\pi}(x) simply reflects the reduction of the corresponding mean-free path \ell_{\pi}, due to enhanced scattering by carbon. The reduction of \kappa_{e,\sigma} is at least an order of magnitude stronger, implying a corresponding reduction of the mean-free path \ell_{\sigma}. With the same assumptions, the reduction of the mean-free path may also be evaluated from the values of the residual electrical resistivity \rho_{0}. Since both bands contribute to electrical conductivity, the factor \rho_{0}(x{=}0)/\rho_{0}(x{=}0.06){\approx}\,6 represents the reduction of the mean-free path, averaged for both bands. The value of this factor is of the same order of magnitude as calculated from \kappa_{e,\pi}. This observation corroborates theoretical work of Mazin _et al._,[3] which suggests that the residual resistivity of MgB_{2} is mostly due to the intraband scattering of holes in the \pi band.

In previous work[19] we reported a significant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law (WFL) in the field-induced normal state of MgB_{2} at low temperatures, below about 6 K. The WFL relates electrical and thermal transport by

\[\kappa_{e}(T)=L_{0}T/\rho(T),\] (1)

where L_{0}{=}\,2.45{\times}10^{-8} W \Omega K^{-2}. This relation normally holds for common metals if the relaxation rates for electrical and thermal currents are equal. Elastic scattering of electrons by defects usually guarantees this equality and hence, in the region where this scattering dominates, in particular where \rho(T){\approx}\,\rho_{0}, the validity of the WFL is expected. The Lorenz number L(T){=}\,\kappa(T)\rho(T)T^{-1}, where \kappa(T) is the total measured conductivity, is equal to L_{0} only if the phonon thermal conductivity is negligible. In the low-temperature normal state of MgB_{2}, induced by fields H\|c{>}\,30 kOe, the ratio L(T)/L_{0} considerably exceeds unity and exhibits a peak at about 1 K, where L/L_{0}{=}\,3.[19] Our estimates for the upper limit of \kappa_{\rm ph} at these temperatures revealed that the phonon contribution to \kappa(T) cannot be responsible for the enhanced Lorenz number, but the cause for the violation of the WFL is not yet firmly established.

For the 6% carbon-doped MgB_{2}, we cannot exceed the upper critical field at low temperatures with our experimental facilities. A direct evaluation of L(T) in the normal state is thus not possible. However, since in our low-temperature data the quasiparticle contribution \kappa_{e}(H) saturates to the normal-state values already in the mixed state above H_{\pi}^{*}, L(T) data at fields H{\gg}H_{\pi}^{*} can be used. In Fig. 4, the low-temperature values of L(T)/L_{0} at H{=}\,50 kOe are presented for the x{=}0.06 sample and, for comparison, for the undoped MgB_{2}.[19] In both cases, L(T) was calculated as discussed in Ref. [19]. In constrast to pure MgB_{2}, L/L_{0}{=}\,1 for Mg(B_{0.94}C_{0.06})_{2} at temperatures T{\leq}\,1 K. The small deviation at elevated temperatures can naturally be attributed to \kappa_{\rm ph} which, with decreasing temperature, becomes much smaller than \kappa_{e}. Thus, at least at low temperatures, no violation of the WFL is observed in the carbon-doped MgB_{2}. It is important to note that in this case, the heat transport is predominantly carried by the quasiparticles of the quasi-3D \pi band. Since in pure MgB_{2}, where the violation of the WFL is pronounced, both the \sigma and the \pi band contribute almost  equally to the normal-state heat transport, it is natural to conclude that the previously observed anomaly is predominantly tied to the transport in the quasi-2D \sigma band. Our results cannot really identify the origin of the violation of the WFL, but they do single out the involved electronic states that are responsible for the effect.

In conclusion, the substitution of carbon for boron leads to a considerable reduction of the electronic thermal conductivity of MgB_{2}, whereby the transport in the \sigma band is much more strongly affected than that in the \pi band. The Wiedemann-Franz law, considerably violated for pure MgB_{2} at low temperatures, seems to be valid for Mg(B_{0.04}C_{0.06})_{2}.

###### Abstract

We report data on the thermal conductivity \kappa(T,H) in the basal plane of hexagonal single crystalline and superconducting Mg(B_{1-\tau}C_{\tau})_{2} (\kappa=0.03, 0.06) at temperatures between 0.5 and 50 K, and in external magnetic fields H between 0 and 50 K. The substitution of carbon for boron leads to a considerable reduction of the electronic heat transport, while the phonon thermal conductivity seems to be much less sensitive to impurities. The introduction of carbon enhances mostly the intraband scattering in the \sigma band. In contrast to the previously observed anomalous behavior of pure MgB_{2}, the Wiedemann-Franz law is valid for Mg(B_{0.94}C_{0.06})_{2} at low temperatures.

 magnetic field below about 5-10 kOe, but in higher fields, the \kappa values for H\parallelc exceed those for H\perpc significantly (see the upper row in Fig. 2). For the carbon-doped samples, \kappa(H) depends only weakly on the field orientation in all fields. Another striking observation across the entire covered temperature range is the much weaker field-induced enhancement of \kappa for the carbon-doped samples than for pure MgB_{2}. At temperatures above about 5 K and for x=0.03 and x =0.06, no field-induced enhancement of \kappa is observed at all, whereas for x=0, it persists at all temperatures up to T_{c} (see the lower row in Fig. 2).

The \kappa(H) curves allow to establish the values of the bulk upper critical field H_{c2} via the onset of the field independence of \kappa(H) (see arrows in Fig. 2). The resulting H_{c2}(T) data are shown in Fig. 3. They are in agreement with results of torque measurements on similar samples.[12]

The zero-field electrical resistivity for the x=0.06 sample was measured between 4.2 and 130 K. The transition at T_{c} =32.9 K is, with a width of about 0.1 K, rather narrow. In the entire covered temperature range above T_{c}, \rho(T) is well described by \rho=\rho_{0}+\sigmaT^{3} (see the inset in Fig. 1) where two scattering processes, associated with quasiparticle scattering by defects and phonons, respectively, are considered. The constant parameters are \rho_{0}=12.3 \mu\Omega cm and a=5.4 \times 10^{-7}\mu\Omega cm K^{-3}. In comparison, for pure MgB_{2}, \rho_{0} =2.0 \mu\Omega cm and a=6.7 \times 10^{-7}\mu\Omega cm K^{-3} (Ref. [19]), which demonstrates that carbon doping strongly enhances the scattering by defects, while the electron-phonon scattering is only weakly altered.

Because we assume that the transport is provided by itinerant electronic (\kappa_{c}) and lattice excitations (\kappa_{\rm ph}), such that \kappa= \kappa_{c}+ \kappa_{\rm ph}, any analysis of the changes of \kappa(T,H) caused by the substitution of carbon for boron should consider corresponding changes in both these channels. In MgB_{2}, the electronic thermal conduction consists of contributions from both the \sigma and the \pi band, hence \kappa_{c}= \kappa_{c,\sigma}+ \kappa_{c,\pi}.[21, 22, 23, 24] When the temperature is reduced to below T_{c} in zero magnetic field, the continuous reduction of the number of unpaired quasiparticles leads to a decrease of \kappa_{c} but, because of the reduction of the scattering of phonons by electrons (holes), also to an increase of \kappa_{\rm ph}. Altogether, the features of \kappa(T) depend on the relative magnitudes of \kappa_{c} and \kappa_{\rm ph} and on the efficiency of phonon scattering by electrons. Since for MgB_{2} the energy gap in the \pi band at a given normalized temperature T/T_{c} is considerably smaller than expected from the BCS theory, the \pi-band contributions to both the heat transport and the phonon scattering extend to lower temperatures than in conventional superconductors. Nevertheless, both \kappa_{c,\sigma} and \kappa_{c,\pi} are negligible at very low temperatures and H= 0. Below 2-3 K, the observed \kappa(T,0) varies approximately as T^{3} (see dashed line in Fig. 1), which is expected for purely phononic conductivity and a dominant scattering of phonons at the sample boundaries. The observation that the \kappa(T,0) curves tend to merge below T_{c} suggests that carbon doping does not influence the thermal conduction via phonons very much, and that the difference in \kappa(T,0) observed at higher temperatures

  results from \kappa_{e} being considerably reduced by the introduction of carbon for boron. The question of which band is more strongly influenced by doping, can be answered by analyzing the \kappa(H) data in the mixed state.

The quasiparticles associated with the vortices provide additional scattering of phonons and also enhance \kappa_{e}. The competition of these two mechanisms results in typical \kappa(H) curves for type-II superconductors, with an initial drop of \kappa when H is raised to above H_{c1} and subsequently to a considerable increase when H approaches H_{c2}. For MgB_{2}, this rather gradual increase of \kappa_{e}(H) is replaced by an extremely rapid increase of \kappa_{e} at fields H{\ll}H_{c2}, followed by a saturation region and yet another increase in the vicinity of H_{c2}.[19] The low-field increase does not scale with H/H_{c2} as is observed for conventional superconductors and is almost independent of field orientation, despite the strong anisotropy of H_{c2}. This unique behavior is explained in terms of a two-band scenario, where the smaller energy gap \Delta_{\pi} is closed at a relatively low and weakly anisotropic field H_{\pi}^{*}{<}H_{c2}, of the order of 10 kOe for pure MgB_{2}.[25, 26, 27] Therefore, \kappa_{e,\pi} increases rapidly when the field approaches H_{\pi}^{*} and, still in the mixed state, adopts its normal-state value above H_{\pi}^{*}. The \sigma-band contribution \kappa_{e,\sigma} only grows when H approaches H_{c2}, the enhancement being strongly anisotropic, reflecting the anisotropy of H_{c2}.

The striking difference between carbon-free and carbon-doped samples is that, for the latter, no significant increase in \kappa(H) is observed in the vicinity of H_{c2}. It implies that \kappa_{e,\sigma} is strongly reduced by carbon substitution from about 50% of the total normal state \kappa_{e} for x{=}0 (Ref. [19]) to a level close to our experimental resolution for x{=}0.03. Hence, the quasiparticle contribution to the heat transport is dominated by the \pi band, i.e., \kappa_{e}{\approx}\,\kappa_{e,\pi}. Carbon doping also reduces \kappa_{e,\pi} but less severely than \kappa_{e,\sigma}. At 1.0 K and in a field H\perp c=45 kOe, the thermal conductivity for the x{=}0.06 sample is a factor of 11 smaller than for pure MgB_{2}. Since at such low temperatures and high fields \kappa_{\rm ph} is rather small, this reduction is obviously due to the carbon-doping-induced reduction of \kappa_{e,\pi}. The quasiparticle thermal conductivity is given by \kappa_{e}{=}C_{\sigma}v_{F}\ell/3, where C_{e} is the electronic specific heat, v_{F} the Fermi velocity, and \ell the mean-free path. If we assume that by carbon doping at the 6% level neither the electronic density of states at the Fermi level N_{\pi}(E_{F}){\approx}\,C_{e,\pi} nor the Fermi velocity v_{F,\pi} in the \pi band are much altered, then the reduction of \kappa_{e,\pi}(x) simply reflects the reduction of the corresponding mean-free path \ell_{\pi}, due to enhanced scattering by carbon. The reduction of \kappa_{e,\sigma} is at least an order of magnitude stronger, implying a corresponding reduction of the mean-free path \ell_{\sigma}. With the same assumptions, the reduction of the mean-free path may also be evaluated from the values of the residual electrical resistivity \rho_{0}. Since both bands contribute to electrical conductivity, the factor \rho_{0}(x{=}0)/\rho_{0}(x{=}0.06){\approx}\,6 represents the reduction of the mean-free path, averaged for both bands. The value of this factor is of the same order of magnitude as calculated from \kappa_{e,\pi}. This observation corroborates theoretical work of Mazin _et al._,[3] which suggests that the residual resistivity of MgB_{2} is mostly due to the intraband scattering of holes in the \pi band.

In previous work[19] we reported a significant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law (WFL) in the field-induced normal state of MgB_{2} at low temperatures, below about 6 K. The WFL relates electrical and thermal transport by

\[\kappa_{e}(T)=L_{0}T/\rho(T),\] (1)

where L_{0}{=}\,2.45{\times}10^{-8} W \Omega K^{-2}. This relation normally holds for common metals if the relaxation rates for electrical and thermal currents are equal. Elastic scattering of electrons by defects usually guarantees this equality and hence, in the region where this scattering dominates, in particular where \rho(T){\approx}\,\rho_{0}, the validity of the WFL is expected. The Lorenz number L(T){=}\,\kappa(T)\rho(T)T^{-1}, where \kappa(T) is the total measured conductivity, is equal to L_{0} only if the phonon thermal conductivity is negligible. In the low-temperature normal state of MgB_{2}, induced by fields H\|c{>}\,30 kOe, the ratio L(T)/L_{0} considerably exceeds unity and exhibits a peak at about 1 K, where L/L_{0}{=}\,3.[19] Our estimates for the upper limit of \kappa_{\rm ph} at these temperatures revealed that the phonon contribution to \kappa(T) cannot be responsible for the enhanced Lorenz number, but the cause for the violation of the WFL is not yet firmly established.

For the 6% carbon-doped MgB_{2}, we cannot exceed the upper critical field at low temperatures with our experimental facilities. A direct evaluation of L(T) in the normal state is thus not possible. However, since in our low-temperature data the quasiparticle contribution \kappa_{e}(H) saturates to the normal-state values already in the mixed state above H_{\pi}^{*}, L(T) data at fields H{\gg}H_{\pi}^{*} can be used. In Fig. 4, the low-temperature values of L(T)/L_{0} at H{=}\,50 kOe are presented for the x{=}0.06 sample and, for comparison, for the undoped MgB_{2}.[19] In both cases, L(T) was calculated as discussed in Ref. [19]. In constrast to pure MgB_{2}, L/L_{0}{=}\,1 for Mg(B_{0.94}C_{0.06})_{2} at temperatures T{\leq}\,1 K. The small deviation at elevated temperatures can naturally be attributed to \kappa_{\rm ph} which, with decreasing temperature, becomes much smaller than \kappa_{e}. Thus, at least at low temperatures, no violation of the WFL is observed in the carbon-doped MgB_{2}. It is important to note that in this case, the heat transport is predominantly carried by the quasiparticles of the quasi-3D \pi band. Since in pure MgB_{2}, where the violation of the WFL is pronounced, both the \sigma and the \pi band contribute almost  equally to the normal-state heat transport, it is natural to conclude that the previously observed anomaly is predominantly tied to the transport in the quasi-2D \sigma band. Our results cannot really identify the origin of the violation of the WFL, but they do single out the involved electronic states that are responsible for the effect.

In conclusion, the substitution of carbon for boron leads to a considerable reduction of the electronic thermal conductivity of MgB_{2}, whereby the transport in the \sigma band is much more strongly affected than that in the \pi band. The Wiedemann-Franz law, considerably violated for pure MgB_{2} at low temperatures, seems to be valid for Mg(B_{0.04}C_{0.06})_{2}.
