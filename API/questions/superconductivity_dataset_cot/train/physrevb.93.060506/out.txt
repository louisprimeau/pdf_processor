###### Abstract

We report an investigation of the superconducting order parameter of the noncentrosymmetric compound PbTaSe_{2}, which is believed to have a topologically nontrivial band structure. Precise measurements of the London penetration depth \Delta(T) obtained using a tunnel diode oscillator (TDO) based method show an exponential temperature dependence at T\ll T_{c}, suggesting a nodeless superconducting gap structure. A single-gap s-wave model well describes the corresponding normalized superfluid density \rho_{s}(T), with a gap magnitude of \Delta(0) \simeq 1.88T_{c}. This is very close to the value of 1.76T_{c} for weak-coupling BCS superconductors, indicating conventional fully-gapped superconductivity in PbTaSe_{2}.

Noncentrosymmetric superconductors (NCS), where the crystal structure does not have a center of inversion, display unique properties. In the presence of antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling (ASOC), the pairing state is expected to be a mixture of spin singlet and triplet components, leading to unusual properties, even when the pairing has the conventional electron-phonon mechanism [1,2]. For instance, evidence for nodal superconductivity has been found in the weakly correlated NCS Li_{2}Pt_{3}B and Y_{2}C_{3}[3,4]. Other NCS such as LaNiC_{2} and BiPd, have been suggested to be multigap superconductors, which gives an indication of singlet-triplet mixing, although this may also arise in a purely singlet s-wave channel [5, 6, 7]. Despite the anticipation of mixed parity pairing in NCS, single-gap BCS-like superconductivity is clearly observed in many of these materials, such as Re_{3}W, LaRhSi_{3}, and BaPtSi_{3}[8, 9, 10]. The presence of singlet-triplet mixing has also been probed by looking for an anisotropic spin susceptibility via measurements of the upper critical field (H_{c2}) and Knight shift, as in the case of CeRhSi_{3} and CeIrSi_{3}[11,12]. In addition, NCS were also proposed to be good candidates for topological superconductivity [13], and there has been particular interest due to the possibility of gapless edge states and Majorana fermions [14,15].

Recently, the new NCS PbTaSe_{2} has been the focus of much interest. The compound crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric structure (space group _P6m2_), containing hexagonal TaSe_{2} layers [16]. The resistivity \rho(T) of TaSe_{2} shows a charge-density-wave (CDW) transition at around 122 K, which is gradually suppressed upon doping with Pb and pure PbTaSe_{2} becomes superconducting below T_{c} = 3.7 K [17,18]. Meanwhile, the inversion symmetry of the crystal structure is also broken as a result of intercalation with Pb, making PbTaSe_{2} a new NCS. Detailed comparisons between electronic structure calculations and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal the presence of topological nodal lines in the band structure, near the Fermi level [19]. This is a result of the spin-orbit coupling lifting the degeneracy of the conduction and valence bands, except at the nodal positions which are gapless due to the reflection symmetry of the crystal lattice. In addition, ARPES measurements give evidence for Dirac surface states, and it was suggested that this may allow for the presence of Majorana bound states in the vortex cores of PbTaSe_{2}[20].

It is therefore of interest to determine whether there is any interplay between the topologically nontrivial band structure and the superconductivity. To find out whether this is a candidate for topological superconductivity, it is important to characterize the superconducting order parameter of PbTaSe_{2} through measurements of the bulk properties. In this Rapid Communication, we report the temperature dependence of the change of London penetration depth \Delta\lambda(T) of high quality single crystal samples using a tunnel diode oscillator (TDO) based method. We find that exponential behavior is clearly observed at T\ll T_{c}, implying a nodeless superconducting energy gap. Further analysis reveals that both \Delta\lambda(T) and the derived superfluid density \rho_{s}(T) can be best fitted by an s-wave model, with a gap size close to the BCS value of 1.76T_{c}, providing strong evidence for single-gap, weak-coupling nodeless superconductivity in the bulk of PbTaSe_{2}.

Single crystals of PbTaSe_{2} were synthesized using a chemical vapor transport (CVT) process [19]. The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity \rho(T) was measured in a ^{4}He system from 292 K to about 3 K, using a four-probe method. Measurements of the dc-magnetic susceptibility were performed in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (MPMS-ST) in the temperature range of 2-6 K, with both field-cooling (FC) and zero-field-cooling (ZFC) in a small applied magnetic field of 10 Oe.

The temperature dependence of the change in London penetration depth \Delta\lambda(T) was precisely measured down to a base temperature of 0.35 K in a ^{3}He cryostat using a TDO-based technique [21] with an operating frequency of about 7 MHz and a noise level of about 0.1 Hz. Single crystal samples were cut into rectangular plates, with dimensions of (500-900) \times (500-900) \times (5-10) \mum^{3}. The samples were mounted on a sapphire rod and inserted into the TDO coil without making contact, and the resonant frequency of the TDO circuit [f(T)] was measured as a function of temperature. A tiny ac field of about 20 mOe was applied to the sample using the TDO coil, which is much smaller than the lower critical field H_{\rm c1}, guaranteeing that the sample is entirely in the Meissner state and therefore the obtained \Delta\lambda(T) can be regarded as the change of the London penetration depth. This quantity is proportional to \Delta f(T) the change in f(T) from the zero temperature value, with \Delta\lambda(T)=G\,\Delta f(T), where the calibration constant G is determined from the sample and coil geometry, following Ref. [22].

Single crystals of PbTaSe_{2} were characterized using both resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements, as shown in Fig. 1. The temperature dependence of \rho(T) displays metallic behavior, since it decreases upon cooling the sample from room temperature, with a very small residual resistivity of about 0.14 \mu\Omega cm, just above the superconducting transition. As a result there is a large residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of \rho(292\,{\rm K})/\rho(4\,{\rm K})=220, which demonstrates the high quality of the single crystals. Upon following the method in Ref. [23], using a coherence length of \xi=16.2 nm and a normal state Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma_{\rm e}=4.8 mJ/mol K^{2}[24], the small residual resistivity gives rise to a large mean free path of 10 \mum. This is significantly larger than the coherence length, indicating that the sample is in the clean limit. The presence of a superconducting transition is clearly displayed in the insets of Fig. 1, onsetting at around 3.9 K in the resistivity and the magnetic susceptibility shows a clear diamagnetic signal, suggesting bulk superconductivity in PbTaSe_{2}. Here, the magnetic susceptibility slightly drops below the value of -1 for full diamagnetic shielding, which is likely due to demagnetization effects.

In inset (a) of Fig. 2, the field dependence of the magnetization is displayed, with the field applied in the ab plane. In the case of type-II superconductors, the magnetization M(H) usually decreases linearly with increasing applied magnetic field for \mu_{0}H<\mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}, where \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1} is the lower critical field, below which the sample is in the Meissner state. When \mu_{0}H >\mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}, M(H) deviates from linear behavior, due to the formation of vortices in the mixed state. We measured from zero field up to 20 mT at different temperatures in the superconducting state. The values of \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1} were obtained from the field where the deviation [\Delta M(H)] from linear behavior [M_{\rm Im}(H)] is greater than 0.05 emu cm^{-3}, where \Delta M(H)=M(H)-M_{\rm Im}(H). This is displayed for the data at 2 K in inset (b) of Fig. 2.

The temperature dependence of \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1} is shown in the main panel of Fig. 2. The zero temperature lower critical field \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(0)=12.0 mT was estimated from fitting H_{\rm c1}(T)=H_{\rm c1}(0)(1-(T/T_{\rm c})^{2}), as shown by the red-dashed line in the figure. In Ginzburg-Landau theory, the magnetic penetration depth \lambda is related to both the coherence length \xi and lower critical field \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}, as described by \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}=\Phi_{0}/(4\pi\lambda^{2})\ln{(\lambda/\xi+1/2)}, where \Phi_{0} is the magnetic flux quantum [25]. Using the values of \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(0)=12.0 mT and \xi=16.2 nm mentioned previously, \lambda(0)=204 nm was estimated and this value was used to calculate the superfluid density below. In addition, \lambda(T) was estimated using the obtained values of \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(T), where \xi(T) was calculated from the reported values of H_{\rm c2}(T)[24; 26].

The penetration depth of two samples is shown in Fig. 3, with calibration factors of G=8.0 A/Hz and 10.0 A/Hz for samples #1 and #2, respectively. The change of the London penetration depth as a function of temperature \Delta\lambda(T) is shown for sample #1 in the inset of Fig. 3 from 5 K above T_{c}, down to about 0.35 K. A sharp decrease near 3.9 K indicates the onset of superconductivity, in agreement with the resistivity and susceptibility measurements and confirms the high sample quality. The main panel of Fig. 3 displays the low temperature

Figure 2: Temperature dependence of the lower critical field \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1} of PbTaSe_{2}, defined as the field above which the field dependence of the magnetization M(H) deviates from a linear decrease. The dashed red line shows a fit to the Ginzburg-Landau formula H_{\rm c1}(T)=H_{\rm c1}(0)[1-(T/T_{\rm c})^{2}). Inset (a) shows M(H) for fields applied in the ab plane, at various temperatures in the superconducting state. Inset (b) shows the deviation \Delta M of the M(H) data from linear behavior at 2 K. H_{\rm c1} is taken to be the field where the deviation is greater than 0.05 emu cm^{-3}, above the region enclosed by the dashed lines.

Figure 1: The main panel shows the electrical resistivity \rho(T) of PbTaSe_{2} single crystals from room temperature down to around 3 K. The insets show the low temperature behavior of (a) \rho(T) and (b) magnetic susceptibility 4\pi\,{\chi} with a field applied in the ab plane, where sharp superconducting transitions are observed.

  measurements of both samples below 1.4 K, where \Delta\lambda(T) rapidly decreases upon cooling, before flattening below about 0.8 K, which suggests fully gapped superconductivity and the absence of low energy excitations. As shown in the plot, this behavior is well reproducible between the two samples. For an s-wave superconductor at T\ll T_{c}, \lambda(T) can be approximated using

\[\Delta\lambda(T)=\lambda(T)-\lambda(0)=\lambda(0)\sqrt{\frac{\pi\,\Delta(0)}{2 T}}\text{exp}\bigg{(}-\frac{\Delta(0)}{T}\bigg{)},\] (1)

where \Delta(0) is the superconducting gap magnitude in units such that k_{B}=1[27]. The data for sample #1 was fitted and the solid line in the figure shows that this expression gives excellent agreement with the experimental data below T_{c}/3, with a value of \Delta(0)=1.72T_{c}, while a very similar value of \Delta(0)=1.70T_{c} is obtained from fitting sample #2, both consistent with weakly coupled BCS superconductivity in PbTaSe_{2}.

To further characterize the superconducting gap symmetry of PbTaSe_{2}, we also analyzed the normalized superfluid density g_{s}(T), which was converted from \Delta\lambda(T) using \rho_{s}(T)=\lambda(0)^{2}\lambda(T)^{2}, with \lambda(0)=204 mm and is displayed for sample #1 in Fig. 4. In addition, we have plotted \rho_{s}(T) calculated from \lambda(T) obtained both from our values of \mu_{0}H_{c1}(T) and from the data in Ref. [17], which are consistent with \rho_{s}(T) obtained from the TDO measurements. For a given gap function \Delta_{k}, \rho_{s}(T) can be calculated as:

\[\rho_{k}(T)=1+2\Bigg{\langle}\int_{\Delta_{k}}^{\infty}\frac{EdE}{\sqrt{E^{2}- \Delta_{k}^{2}}}\frac{\partial f}{\partial E}\Bigg{\rangle}_{\text{FS}},\] (2)

where f(E,T)=[1+\text{exp}(E/T)]^{-1} is the Fermi distribution function and \langle\ldots\rangle_{\text{FS}} represents an average over the Fermi surface [27]. Here, the gap function is defined as \Delta_{k}(T)=\Delta(T)g_{k}, where g_{k} contains the angular dependence and g_{k}=1, sin\theta and cos2\phi for the s-, p- and d-wave models, respectively, where \theta is the polar angle and \phi is the azimuthal angle. The temperature dependence of the gap [\Delta(T)] is approximated as

\[\Delta(T)=\Delta(0)\text{tanh}\{1.82[1.018(T_{c}/T-1)]^{0.51}\},\] (3)

where \Delta(0) represents the gap magnitude at zero temperature, which is the only adjustable parameter in the fitting [28].

The fitting results are also plotted in Fig. 4. In the case of the s-wave model, the superconducting gap is isotropic. It is clearly shown that the experimental data is well fitted by this model, with a gap amplitude of \Delta(0)=1.88T_{c}. This is consistent with the value obtained from fitting the penetration depth, close to the BCS value, suggesting that PbTaSe_{2} is a fully-gapped, weakly coupled superconductor. On the other hand, a p-wave model with point nodes and a d-wave model with line nodes were also used for comparison, both of which predict \rho_{s} to continue increasing with decreasing temperature due to the existence of low energy excitations. These models strongly disagree with our results, giving further evidence for nodeless superconductivity in PbTaSe_{2}.

Our results indicate that the bulk superconductivity of PbTaSe_{2} is consistent with fully gapped s-wave superconductivity with a gap size close to the weakly coupled BCS value. The nodeless bulk superconductivity is consistent with recent measurements of the specific heat, which could also be fitted with exponential behavior at low temperatures [24]. However, different strengths of the electron-phonon coupling were deduced, with strongly coupled behavior suggested from the large specific heat jump \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} in Ref. [24], while the values in Refs. [17, 29] are consistent with weak coupling, in line with our results. In addition, thermal conductivity measurements also indicate nodeless superconductivity [30] and it was also suggested that the "S" shape in the field dependence of the

The solid line shows a fit to an s-wave model described in the text, which indicates conventional fully-gapped superconductivity. The inset shows \Delta\lambda(T) from 5 K down to the base temperature for sample #1, which exhibits a sharp superconducting transition around 3.9 K, consistent with resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements.

The symbols represent the experimental data while the lines show the results of fitting the data with different models of the gap structure. The solid violet and open green circles show \rho_{s}(T) obtained from our \mu_{0}H_{c1} measurements and the data in Ref. [17], respectively.

  thermal conductivity may indicate multiband superconductivity in PbTaSe_{2}. However, from our measurements we find that the superfluid density can be well accounted for by a single gap model.

The fact that these results are consistent with single-gap s-wave superconductivity would suggest that the pairing in noncentrosymmetric PbTaSe_{2} is dominated by the spin singlet component. Indeed the lack of singlet-triplet mixing in PbTaSe_{2} is somewhat of a puzzle, given the strong effect of the ASOC [19]. It should be noted that there are other NCS which are compatible with single-gap, BCS-like superconductivity, including materials such as LaPt_{3}Si which show a significant ASOC [31], and the reason for this behavior has yet to be resolved. It has previously been suggested that for NCS to have gapless edge states and Majorana modes, the triplet component should be larger than the s-wave singlet component [14]. For s-wave superconductors in the presence of Rashba ASOC, it is necessary to apply a large magnetic field for Majorana fermions to be realized [15]. Nevertheless, it was suggested in Ref. [20] that the topologically nontrivial nature of the electronic structure of PbTaSe_{2} means that Majorana modes may be present in vortices, even if the bulk superconductivity is of an s-wave nature, as long as it is fully gapped. Given that our results support the existence of fully gapped superconductivity, further experiments are desirable to look for the presence of Majorana modes and other signatures of topological order.

To summarize, we have investigated the superconducting order parameter of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor PbTaSe_{2}. The change in the London penetration depth \Delta\lambda(T) of single crystals was precisely measured down to 0.1T_{c}, which clearly shows an exponential temperature dependence below T_{c}/3, indicating fully gapped behavior. Both \Delta\lambda(T) and its deduced superfluid density \rho_{\rm{s}}(T) can be described by a single-gap s-wave model, providing strong evidence for a nodeless superconducting gap structure in PbTaSe_{2}. A gap magnitude of \Delta(0)=1.88T_{c} is obtained from fitting the superfluid density, which is slightly larger than the weak coupling BCS value of 1.76T_{c} and indicates the absence of strong electron-phonon coupling.

###### Abstract

We report an investigation of the superconducting order parameter of the noncentrosymmetric compound PbTaSe_{2}, which is believed to have a topologically nontrivial band structure. Precise measurements of the London penetration depth \Delta(T) obtained using a tunnel diode oscillator (TDO) based method show an exponential temperature dependence at T\ll T_{c}, suggesting a nodeless superconducting gap structure. A single-gap s-wave model well describes the corresponding normalized superfluid density \rho_{s}(T), with a gap magnitude of \Delta(0) \simeq 1.88T_{c}. This is very close to the value of 1.76T_{c} for weak-coupling BCS superconductors, indicating conventional fully-gapped superconductivity in PbTaSe_{2}.

Noncentrosymmetric superconductors (NCS), where the crystal structure does not have a center of inversion, display unique properties. In the presence of antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling (ASOC), the pairing state is expected to be a mixture of spin singlet and triplet components, leading to unusual properties, even when the pairing has the conventional electron-phonon mechanism [1,2]. For instance, evidence for nodal superconductivity has been found in the weakly correlated NCS Li_{2}Pt_{3}B and Y_{2}C_{3}[3,4]. Other NCS such as LaNiC_{2} and BiPd, have been suggested to be multigap superconductors, which gives an indication of singlet-triplet mixing, although this may also arise in a purely singlet s-wave channel [5, 6, 7]. Despite the anticipation of mixed parity pairing in NCS, single-gap BCS-like superconductivity is clearly observed in many of these materials, such as Re_{3}W, LaRhSi_{3}, and BaPtSi_{3}[8, 9, 10]. The presence of singlet-triplet mixing has also been probed by looking for an anisotropic spin susceptibility via measurements of the upper critical field (H_{c2}) and Knight shift, as in the case of CeRhSi_{3} and CeIrSi_{3}[11,12]. In addition, NCS were also proposed to be good candidates for topological superconductivity [13], and there has been particular interest due to the possibility of gapless edge states and Majorana fermions [14,15].

Recently, the new NCS PbTaSe_{2} has been the focus of much interest. The compound crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric structure (space group _P6m2_), containing hexagonal TaSe_{2} layers [16]. The resistivity \rho(T) of TaSe_{2} shows a charge-density-wave (CDW) transition at around 122 K, which is gradually suppressed upon doping with Pb and pure PbTaSe_{2} becomes superconducting below T_{c} = 3.7 K [17,18]. Meanwhile, the inversion symmetry of the crystal structure is also broken as a result of intercalation with Pb, making PbTaSe_{2} a new NCS. Detailed comparisons between electronic structure calculations and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal the presence of topological nodal lines in the band structure, near the Fermi level [19]. This is a result of the spin-orbit coupling lifting the degeneracy of the conduction and valence bands, except at the nodal positions which are gapless due to the reflection symmetry of the crystal lattice. In addition, ARPES measurements give evidence for Dirac surface states, and it was suggested that this may allow for the presence of Majorana bound states in the vortex cores of PbTaSe_{2}[20].

It is therefore of interest to determine whether there is any interplay between the topologically nontrivial band structure and the superconductivity. To find out whether this is a candidate for topological superconductivity, it is important to characterize the superconducting order parameter of PbTaSe_{2} through measurements of the bulk properties. In this Rapid Communication, we report the temperature dependence of the change of London penetration depth \Delta\lambda(T) of high quality single crystal samples using a tunnel diode oscillator (TDO) based method. We find that exponential behavior is clearly observed at T\ll T_{c}, implying a nodeless superconducting energy gap. Further analysis reveals that both \Delta\lambda(T) and the derived superfluid density \rho_{s}(T) can be best fitted by an s-wave model, with a gap size close to the BCS value of 1.76T_{c}, providing strong evidence for single-gap, weak-coupling nodeless superconductivity in the bulk of PbTaSe_{2}.

Single crystals of PbTaSe_{2} were synthesized using a chemical vapor transport (CVT) process [19]. The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity \rho(T) was measured in a ^{4}He system from 292 K to about 3 K, using a four-probe method. Measurements of the dc-magnetic susceptibility were performed in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (MPMS-ST) in the temperature range of 2-6 K, with both field-cooling (FC) and zero-field-cooling (ZFC) in a small applied magnetic field of 10 Oe.

The temperature dependence of the change in London penetration depth \Delta\lambda(T) was precisely measured down to a base temperature of 0.35 K in a ^{3}He cryostat using a TDO-based technique [21] with an operating frequency of about 7 MHz and a noise level of about 0.1 Hz. Single crystal samples were cut into rectangular plates, with dimensions of (500-900) \times (500-900) \times (5-10) \mum^{3}. The samples were mounted on a sapphire rod and inserted into the TDO coil without making contact, and the resonant frequency of the TDO circuit [f(T)] was measured as a function of temperature. A tiny ac field of about 20 mOe was applied to the sample using the TDO coil, which is much smaller than the lower critical field H_{\rm c1}, guaranteeing that the sample is entirely in the Meissner state and therefore the obtained \Delta\lambda(T) can be regarded as the change of the London penetration depth. This quantity is proportional to \Delta f(T) the change in f(T) from the zero temperature value, with \Delta\lambda(T)=G\,\Delta f(T), where the calibration constant G is determined from the sample and coil geometry, following Ref. [22].

Single crystals of PbTaSe_{2} were characterized using both resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements, as shown in Fig. 1. The temperature dependence of \rho(T) displays metallic behavior, since it decreases upon cooling the sample from room temperature, with a very small residual resistivity of about 0.14 \mu\Omega cm, just above the superconducting transition. As a result there is a large residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of \rho(292\,{\rm K})/\rho(4\,{\rm K})=220, which demonstrates the high quality of the single crystals. Upon following the method in Ref. [23], using a coherence length of \xi=16.2 nm and a normal state Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma_{\rm e}=4.8 mJ/mol K^{2}[24], the small residual resistivity gives rise to a large mean free path of 10 \mum. This is significantly larger than the coherence length, indicating that the sample is in the clean limit. The presence of a superconducting transition is clearly displayed in the insets of Fig. 1, onsetting at around 3.9 K in the resistivity and the magnetic susceptibility shows a clear diamagnetic signal, suggesting bulk superconductivity in PbTaSe_{2}. Here, the magnetic susceptibility slightly drops below the value of -1 for full diamagnetic shielding, which is likely due to demagnetization effects.

In inset (a) of Fig. 2, the field dependence of the magnetization is displayed, with the field applied in the ab plane. In the case of type-II superconductors, the magnetization M(H) usually decreases linearly with increasing applied magnetic field for \mu_{0}H<\mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}, where \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1} is the lower critical field, below which the sample is in the Meissner state. When \mu_{0}H >\mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}, M(H) deviates from linear behavior, due to the formation of vortices in the mixed state. We measured from zero field up to 20 mT at different temperatures in the superconducting state. The values of \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1} were obtained from the field where the deviation [\Delta M(H)] from linear behavior [M_{\rm Im}(H)] is greater than 0.05 emu cm^{-3}, where \Delta M(H)=M(H)-M_{\rm Im}(H). This is displayed for the data at 2 K in inset (b) of Fig. 2.

The temperature dependence of \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1} is shown in the main panel of Fig. 2. The zero temperature lower critical field \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(0)=12.0 mT was estimated from fitting H_{\rm c1}(T)=H_{\rm c1}(0)(1-(T/T_{\rm c})^{2}), as shown by the red-dashed line in the figure. In Ginzburg-Landau theory, the magnetic penetration depth \lambda is related to both the coherence length \xi and lower critical field \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}, as described by \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}=\Phi_{0}/(4\pi\lambda^{2})\ln{(\lambda/\xi+1/2)}, where \Phi_{0} is the magnetic flux quantum [25]. Using the values of \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(0)=12.0 mT and \xi=16.2 nm mentioned previously, \lambda(0)=204 nm was estimated and this value was used to calculate the superfluid density below. In addition, \lambda(T) was estimated using the obtained values of \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(T), where \xi(T) was calculated from the reported values of H_{\rm c2}(T)[24; 26].

The penetration depth of two samples is shown in Fig. 3, with calibration factors of G=8.0 A/Hz and 10.0 A/Hz for samples #1 and #2, respectively. The change of the London penetration depth as a function of temperature \Delta\lambda(T) is shown for sample #1 in the inset of Fig. 3 from 5 K above T_{c}, down to about 0.35 K. A sharp decrease near 3.9 K indicates the onset of superconductivity, in agreement with the resistivity and susceptibility measurements and confirms the high sample quality. The main panel of Fig. 3 displays the low temperature

The dashed red line shows a fit to the Ginzburg-Landau formula H_{\rm c1}(T)=H_{\rm c1}(0)[1-(T/T_{\rm c})^{2}). Inset (a) shows M(H) for fields applied in the ab plane, at various temperatures in the superconducting state. Inset (b) shows the deviation \Delta M of the M(H) data from linear behavior at 2 K. H_{\rm c1} is taken to be the field where the deviation is greater than 0.05 emu cm^{-3}, above the region enclosed by the dashed lines.

Figure 1: The main panel shows the electrical resistivity \rho(T) of PbTaSe_{2} single crystals from room temperature down to around 3 K. The insets show the low temperature behavior of (a) \rho(T) and (b) magnetic susceptibility 4\pi\,{\chi} with a field applied in the ab plane, where sharp superconducting transitions are observed.

  measurements of both samples below 1.4 K, where \Delta\lambda(T) rapidly decreases upon cooling, before flattening below about 0.8 K, which suggests fully gapped superconductivity and the absence of low energy excitations. As shown in the plot, this behavior is well reproducible between the two samples. For an s-wave superconductor at T\ll T_{c}, \lambda(T) can be approximated using

\[\Delta\lambda(T)=\lambda(T)-\lambda(0)=\lambda(0)\sqrt{\frac{\pi\,\Delta(0)}{2 T}}\text{exp}\bigg{(}-\frac{\Delta(0)}{T}\bigg{)},\] (1)

where \Delta(0) is the superconducting gap magnitude in units such that k_{B}=1[27]. The data for sample #1 was fitted and the solid line in the figure shows that this expression gives excellent agreement with the experimental data below T_{c}/3, with a value of \Delta(0)=1.72T_{c}, while a very similar value of \Delta(0)=1.70T_{c} is obtained from fitting sample #2, both consistent with weakly coupled BCS superconductivity in PbTaSe_{2}.

To further characterize the superconducting gap symmetry of PbTaSe_{2}, we also analyzed the normalized superfluid density g_{s}(T), which was converted from \Delta\lambda(T) using \rho_{s}(T)=\lambda(0)^{2}\lambda(T)^{2}, with \lambda(0)=204 mm and is displayed for sample #1 in Fig. 4. In addition, we have plotted \rho_{s}(T) calculated from \lambda(T) obtained both from our values of \mu_{0}H_{c1}(T) and from the data in Ref. [17], which are consistent with \rho_{s}(T) obtained from the TDO measurements. For a given gap function \Delta_{k}, \rho_{s}(T) can be calculated as:

\[\rho_{k}(T)=1+2\Bigg{\langle}\int_{\Delta_{k}}^{\infty}\frac{EdE}{\sqrt{E^{2}- \Delta_{k}^{2}}}\frac{\partial f}{\partial E}\Bigg{\rangle}_{\text{FS}},\] (2)

where f(E,T)=[1+\text{exp}(E/T)]^{-1} is the Fermi distribution function and \langle\ldots\rangle_{\text{FS}} represents an average over the Fermi surface [27]. Here, the gap function is defined as \Delta_{k}(T)=\Delta(T)g_{k}, where g_{k} contains the angular dependence and g_{k}=1, sin\theta and cos2\phi for the s-, p- and d-wave models, respectively, where \theta is the polar angle and \phi is the azimuthal angle. The temperature dependence of the gap [\Delta(T)] is approximated as

\[\Delta(T)=\Delta(0)\text{tanh}\{1.82[1.018(T_{c}/T-1)]^{0.51}\},\] (3)

where \Delta(0) represents the gap magnitude at zero temperature, which is the only adjustable parameter in the fitting [28].

The fitting results are also plotted in Fig. 4. In the case of the s-wave model, the superconducting gap is isotropic. It is clearly shown that the experimental data is well fitted by this model, with a gap amplitude of \Delta(0)=1.88T_{c}. This is consistent with the value obtained from fitting the penetration depth, close to the BCS value, suggesting that PbTaSe_{2} is a fully-gapped, weakly coupled superconductor. On the other hand, a p-wave model with point nodes and a d-wave model with line nodes were also used for comparison, both of which predict \rho_{s} to continue increasing with decreasing temperature due to the existence of low energy excitations. These models strongly disagree with our results, giving further evidence for nodeless superconductivity in PbTaSe_{2}.

Our results indicate that the bulk superconductivity of PbTaSe_{2} is consistent with fully gapped s-wave superconductivity with a gap size close to the weakly coupled BCS value. The nodeless bulk superconductivity is consistent with recent measurements of the specific heat, which could also be fitted with exponential behavior at low temperatures [24]. However, different strengths of the electron-phonon coupling were deduced, with strongly coupled behavior suggested from the large specific heat jump \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} in Ref. [24], while the values in Refs. [17, 29] are consistent with weak coupling, in line with our results. In addition, thermal conductivity measurements also indicate nodeless superconductivity [30] and it was also suggested that the "S" shape in the field dependence of the

Figure 3: The change of the London penetration depth in the ab plane \Delta\lambda(T) as a function of temperature below T_{c}/3 for two samples of single crystal PbTaSe_{2}. The solid line shows a fit to an s-wave model described in the text, which indicates conventional fully-gapped superconductivity. The inset shows \Delta\lambda(T) from 5 K down to the base temperature for sample #1, which exhibits a sharp superconducting transition around 3.9 K, consistent with resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements.

Figure 4: Temperature dependence of the normalized superfluid density \rho_{s}(T) for sample #1 of single crystal PbTaSe_{2}. The symbols represent the experimental data while the lines show the results of fitting the data with different models of the gap structure. The solid violet and open green circles show \rho_{s}(T) obtained from our \mu_{0}H_{c1} measurements and the data in Ref. [17], respectively.

  thermal conductivity may indicate multiband superconductivity in PbTaSe_{2}. However, from our measurements we find that the superfluid density can be well accounted for by a single gap model.

The fact that these results are consistent with single-gap s-wave superconductivity would suggest that the pairing in noncentrosymmetric PbTaSe_{2} is dominated by the spin singlet component. Indeed the lack of singlet-triplet mixing in PbTaSe_{2} is somewhat of a puzzle, given the strong effect of the ASOC [19]. It should be noted that there are other NCS which are compatible with single-gap, BCS-like superconductivity, including materials such as LaPt_{3}Si which show a significant ASOC [31], and the reason for this behavior has yet to be resolved. It has previously been suggested that for NCS to have gapless edge states and Majorana modes, the triplet component should be larger than the s-wave singlet component [14]. For s-wave superconductors in the presence of Rashba ASOC, it is necessary to apply a large magnetic field for Majorana fermions to be realized [15]. Nevertheless, it was suggested in Ref. [20] that the topologically nontrivial nature of the electronic structure of PbTaSe_{2} means that Majorana modes may be present in vortices, even if the bulk superconductivity is of an s-wave nature, as long as it is fully gapped. Given that our results support the existence of fully gapped superconductivity, further experiments are desirable to look for the presence of Majorana modes and other signatures of topological order.

To summarize, we have investigated the superconducting order parameter of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor PbTaSe_{2}. The change in the London penetration depth \Delta\lambda(T) of single crystals was precisely measured down to 0.1T_{c}, which clearly shows an exponential temperature dependence below T_{c}/3, indicating fully gapped behavior. Both \Delta\lambda(T) and its deduced superfluid density \rho_{\rm{s}}(T) can be described by a single-gap s-wave model, providing strong evidence for a nodeless superconducting gap structure in PbTaSe_{2}. A gap magnitude of \Delta(0)=1.88T_{c} is obtained from fitting the superfluid density, which is slightly larger than the weak coupling BCS value of 1.76T_{c} and indicates the absence of strong electron-phonon coupling.
