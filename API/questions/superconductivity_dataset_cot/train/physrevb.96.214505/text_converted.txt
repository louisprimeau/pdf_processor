###### Abstract

Layered LnOBiS₂ (where Ln represents a lanthanide element) compounds
with Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Yb can be rendered conducting and
superconducting via two routes, substitution of F for O or the
tetravalent ions Ti, Zr, Hf, and Th for trivalent Ln ions. Electrical
resistivity measurements on nonfluorinated La_(0.80)Ti_(0.20)OBiS₂ and
La_(0.85)Th_(0.15)OBiS₂ superconductors were performed between ∼1.5 and
300 K and under pressure up to 2.4 GPa. For both compounds, the
superconducting transition temperature T_(c), which is ∼2.9 K at ambient
pressure, gradually increases with pressure to 3.2-3.7 K at ∼1 GPa,
above which it is suppressed and the superconducting transitions become
very broad. Measurements of the normal-state electrical resistivity of
the two compounds reveal discontinuous changes in the resistivity as a
function of pressure at ∼0.6 GPa. Surprisingly, above 1.3 GPa,
semiconductibile behavior reappears in La_(0.80)Ti_(0.20)OBiS₂. This
paper reveals a new high-pressure phase of La_(1 − x)M_(x)OBiS₂
containing the tetravalent ions M = Ti, Th which does not favor
superconductivity. In contrast, application of pressure to fluorinated
LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ produces an abrupt tetragonal-monoclinic transition
to a metallic phase with an enhanced T_(c). These results demonstrate
that the response of the normal and superconducting properties of
LaOBiS₂-based compounds depends strongly on the atomic site where the
electron donor ions are substituted.

## I Introduction

Following the discovery of superconductivity in the layered bismuth
oxysulfide compound Bi₄O₄S₃, an intense effort to find new BiS₂-based
superconductors quickly ensued as a result of the remarkable flexibility
of the BiS₂ layers in forming compounds with new chemical compositions
[1, 2, 3, 4]. By doping the BiS₂ layers with electrons via appropriate
chemical substitutions, superconductivity was found in Ln(O, F)BiS₂ (Ln
= La-Nd, Yb), (Sr, La)FeBiS₂, (La, _M_)OBiS₂ (_M_ = Ti, Zr, Hf, Th),
Bi₃O₂S₃, La(O, F)BiSe₂, EuBiS₂F, and EuBi₂Si₂S₄F with values of the
superconducting transition temperature T_(c) ranging from 2.7 to 10.6 K
[2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. One of the fascinating features in the
behavior of several of the BiS₂-based superconductors, including
LnO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ (Ln = La-Nd, Yb), (La, Sm)O_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂,
Sr_(0.5)Re_(0.5)FBiS₂ (Re = La-Pr, Sm) (where Re represents a rare earth
element), LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiSe₂, and EuBiS₂F, is the pressure-induced
enhancement of T_(c) that occurs at about 0.5-2.2 GPa, revealing the
existence of two distinct superconducting phases [13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
18, 19]. This phenomenon is believed to be associated with a structural
phase transition, which has been demonstrated in the case of
LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂, from a tetragonal structure to a monoclinic
structure with a sudden change in unit-cell volume at an external
pressure (P) of ∼0.5 GPa [20].

In addition to the requisite superconducting BiS₂ layers, there are
other similarities in the compounds reported to have a second
superconducting phase under high pressure: (1) All of these compounds
contain F, which resides in blocking layers and donates conduction
electrons to the BiS₂ layers, and (2) the high-pressure phase has a
significantly larger value of T_(c) than the low-pressure phase. These
similarities raise the issue of whether F is essential for the formation
of the pressure-induced high-T_(c) phase. Recently, superconductivity
was also found in single-crystalline CeOBiS₂ at 1.3 K, and the value of
T_(c) could gradually be enhanced under an external pressure [21]. This
phenomenon was suggested to be related to Ce valence fluctuations, which
can be tuned via the application of pressure; however, it is still not
clear if there are concomitant phase transitions. On the other hand, the
compounds La_(1 − x)M_(x)OBiS₂ (_M_ = Ti, Zr, Hf, Th) were reported to
have the same crystal structure, very similar lattice parameters, and
values of T_(c) (∼3 K) similar to that of LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂[8]. The M
ions in La_(1 − x)M_(x)OBiS₂ are tetravalent and contribute conduction
electrons to the BiS₂ layers in the absence of F; hence, this system is
ideal for investigating whether non-F-substituted BiS₂ compounds have a
second pressure-induced high-T_(c) phase. High-pressure studies of
La_(1 − x)M_(x)OBiS₂ also have the potential for uncovering new
superconducting phases in BiS₂-based superconductors and will be very
helpful in developing an understanding of the nature of the
pressure-induced low-T_(c) to high-T_(c) phase transition in these
materials.

## II Experimental details

Polycrystalline samples of La_(0.80)Ti_(0.20)OBiS₂ and
La_(0.85)Th_(0.15)OBiS₂ were synthesized by solid-state reaction as
described elsewhere [8]. Geometric factors used in determining the
electrical resistivity for each sample were measured before applying
pressure. Hydrostatic pressure was generated by using a clamped
piston-cylinder cell in which a 1:1 mixture of _n_-pentane and isoamyl
alcohol by volume was used as the pressure-transmitting medium. The
pressures applied to the samples were estimated by measuring the of a
high-purity (> 99.99

## III Results and discussion

The resistive superconducting transition curves ρ(T), normalized to the
value of ρ in the normal state at 4.2 K for polycrystalline
La0.80Ti0.20OBiS2 and La0.85Th0.15OBiS2 samples are shown in the upper
and lower panels of Fig. 1, respectively. The superconducting
transitions are very sharp for pressures below 0.95 GPa for both
samples; however, the transitions become quite broad at higher
pressures, and the values of ρ remain finite down to 1.5 K. The
relationship between T_(c) and pressure for the two compounds can be
seen in Fig. 2. T_(c)^(99%), T_(c)^(90%), T_(c)^(50%), and T_(c)^(10%)
represent the temperatures where ρ falls to 99

normalized to its normal-state value at 4.2 K, below 4 K for
La0.80Ti0.20OBiS2 (upper panel) and La0.85Th0.15OBiS2 (lower panel). The
numbers and symbols with different colors in both panels are used to
indicate the pressures listed in the lower panel. Most of the ρ(T) data
(represented by circles) were obtained upon increasing pressure. Crosses
and the ↓ on the right side of the number 8 in this figure as well as in
the following figures throughout this paper are used to represent data
taken upon decreasing pressure.

Figure 2: Superconducting transition temperature T_(c) vs pressure for
La0.80Ti0.20OBiS2 (upper panel) and La0.85Th0.15OBiS2 (lower panel). The
temperature at which ρ drops to 99

the width of the superconducting transition, becomes much larger at
pressures at which T_(c) starts decreasing (0.95 GPa), reflecting
dramatic changes in the superconductivity. During the pressure releasing
cycle, the values of T_(c) are reversible, and the superconducting
transitions become sharp again when the samples have returned to low
pressures as can be seen in Figs. 1 and 2 (data represented by the
crosses). These features in the T_(c) vs P data indicate that there are
significant differences in the superconducting behavior below and above
0.95 GPa.

To obtain further information about the origin of the suppression of
superconductivity at high pressure, we investigated the normal-state
resistivity of the two compounds under pressure. Upon warming, ρ(T) of
La_(0.85)Th_(0.15)OBiS₂ first decreases significantly, passes through a
minimum, and then increases nearly linearly at higher temperatures as
shown in Fig. 3. Such minima in the normal-state resistivity are also
observed for La_(0.80)Ti_(0.20)OBiS₂ under pressure and other BiS₂-based
superconductors [8, 11, 13, 23, 24]. In addition, subtle anomalies in
resistivity, indicated by the black arrows in Fig. 3, were observed in
both compounds when pressure was applied to the samples. Upon a further
increase in pressure, the temperature at which the anomaly displays a
kink (T_(a)) increases with increasing pressure (see the lower inset of
Fig. 3); however, at pressures above 0.42 GPa, such anomalies in ρ(T)
can no longer be observed. Very recently, a similar kink in ρ(T) was
reported in nonsuperconducting LaOBiSe₂ at ambient pressure, which may
related to a charge-density wave transition and can be suppressed by F
substitution [25]. In this paper, the appearance of these anomalies is
possibly due to a temperature-driven phase transition; however, the
nature of the transition will require further investigation.

In this paper, we use the parameter a(T), which represents the slope of
ρ(T), (dρ/dT), at a certain temperature to characterize the tendency of
the compound to exhibit metallic- or semiconductinglike behavior. For
simple metals at high temperatures, a is related closely to the
scattering of conduction electrons by phonons. Although the value of a
does not have a clear physical significance for semiconductors, a
positive value of a suggests that the sample is metalliclike and a
negative value of a means it is semiconductinglike. In this paper, the
quantity a(T) represents the tendency of the compounds to exhibit
metallic- or semiconductinglike behavior at different pressures. As
shown in Fig. 4(a), the values of a at ∼10 K (a_(10 K)) for the two
compounds are negative at ambient pressure, suggesting
semiconductinglike behavior at low temperatures. Upon application of an
external pressures, a_(10 K) first increases rapidly at low pressures
but relatively moderately at high pressures, resulting in a kink in the
pressure dependence of a_(10 K) at ∼0.7 GPa. Although the values of
a_(10 K) are all negative at pressures up to 2.4 GPa, the increase in
a_(10 K) with pressure clearly indicates suppression of the
semiconductinglike behavior. The kinks in a_(10 K)(P) found at ∼0.7 GPa
suggests there are some fundamental differences between behaviors of the
two compounds at low and high pressures, which are consistent with the
decrease in T_(c) and broadening of the superconducting transitions at
high pressure discussed previously.

Although the pressure dependences of a at low temperatures are quite
similar for the two compounds, the values of a at 250 K (a_(250 K)) for
La_(0.85)Th_(0.15)OBiS₂ are positive and almost the same at low
pressures, in contrast to the remarkable enhancement of a_(250 K) from
negative to positive values in the case of La_(0.80)Ti_(0.20)OBiS₂ as
shown in Fig. 4(b). As indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. 4(b), the
pressure dependence of a_(250 K) dramatically decreases at higher
pressures for both compounds, which suggests not only pressure-induced
suppression of metalliclike behavior at high temperatures for the two
compounds, but also indicates the appearance of high-pressure phases
that exhibit different types of electronic conduction compared to the
corresponding low-pressure phases. This behavior can be observed (Fig.
3) at high temperatures above ∼60 K for the Ti-substituted sample and
above ∼140 K for the Th-substituted sample. It should be noted that the
values of a_(250 K) for La_(0.80)Ti_(0.20)OBiS₂ are even negative above
1.3 GPa, indicating the reappearance of semiconductinglike behavior at
high temperatures.

normalized to the value of ρ at 280 K, (ρ/p_(280 K)) of
La_(0.80)Ti_(0.20)OBiS₂ (upper panel) and La_(0.85)Th_(0.15)OBiS₂ (lower
panel) at various pressures. The pressure corresponding to each
(ρ/p_(280 K)) curve is indicated in Fig. 1 with the same color. The
upper inset: enlargement of the T dependence of ρ/p_(280 K) where the
anomalies in ρ(T) can be observed. The orange curve represents the data
obtained at 0.24 GPa during the pressure releasing cycle. The lower
inset: temperature at which the anomaly in ρ(T) occurs, (T_(a)) vs
pressure (P). The black arrows in the figure indicate the location of
the anomalies in the resistivity.

Either the suppression of metallic conductivity or the reappearance of
semiconductinglike behavior is unusual for solids under pressure since
applying external pressures generally decreases the distance between
neighboring atoms and results in an increase in the carrier density as
well as a suppression of the semiconducting energy gap. For a better
understanding of the normal-state resistivity, we plotted representative
ρ at 4.2 K (ρ_(4.2 K)) vs pressure data for the two compounds in Fig. 5.
It can be observed that ρ_(4.2 K) for both compounds is significantly
suppressed when pressure is applied first, which can easily be
understood due to the increase in the electron density under pressures.
With a further increase in pressure, however, ρ_(4.2 K) of
La_(0.80)Ti_(0.20)OBiS₂ increases slowly, whereas ρ_(4.2 K) of
La_(0.85)Ti_(0.15)OBiS₂ decreases very slightly, resulting in kinks in
ρ_(4.2 K)(P) at ∼0.6 GPa for both compounds, as indicated by the arrows
in Fig. 5. Consistent with previous discussions about the behavior of
superconductivity and a under pressure, a different phase whose
normal-state resistivity exhibits an unusual response to pressure
appears at pressures above ∼0.6 GPa.

As mentioned in the Introduction, all of the BiS₂-based superconductors
which were reported to show pressure-induced low-T_(c) to high-T_(c)
phase transitions contain F. The previous study of Sm-substituted
LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ suggested that the pressure dependences of T_(c) in
BiS₂-based superconductors are closely related to the lattice parameter
a rather than the chemical composition of the blocking layers [13]. In
this paper, although phase transitions were clearly observed in
La_(0.80)Ti_(0.20)OBiS₂ and La_(0.85)Th_(0.15)OBiS₂ via investigations
of the behavior of both the superconducting transitions and the
normal-state electrical resistivity under pressure, the high-pressure
phases of the two compounds are apparently unfavorable for
superconductivity. The results indicate that F in the blocking layer of
BiS₂-based compounds plays a critical role of not only providing
conduction electrons, but also providing the sudden pressure-induced
enhancement of superconductivity. This is presumably associated with a
structural phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic symmetry as
has been shown for LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂.

Although superconductivity is suppressed and ρ remains finite to 1.5 K,
the decrease in ρ signaling the appearance of superconducting currents
can still be observed up to the highest pressure obtained in this paper.
For homogeneous samples, in general, pressure-induced phase transitions
(either structural or electronic, first or second order) usually occur
in a rather narrow hydrostatic pressure range. The abrupt changes in
normal-state resistivity presented in this paper also suggest the phase
transition should be complete before 1 GPa; this raises the question of
why the superconducting transitions of the two compounds remain broad at
pressures above 1 GPa. Considering the fact that bulk superconductivity
of the samples at ambient pressure has been verified by means of
specific heat and magnetization measurements [8], it is possible that
the high-pressure phase is not superconducting and the superconducting
currents observed above ∼1 GPa are associated with small regions of the
low-pressure phase that remains at high pressure due to slight
inhomogeneities in the samples. However, the possibility that the
high-pressure state of the compounds is still superconducting at lower
tempera

indicate that the values are negative, suggesting semiconductinglike
behavior. The dashed lines are guides to the eye.

vs P data, whose slopes change at ∼0.6 GPa (indicated by the arrows) for
both compounds.

tures cannot be ruled out. Further studies need to be performed to
determine whether the compounds are superconducting at lower
temperatures.

## IV Concluding remarks

To summarize, the observed phenomena including suppression and
broadening of the superconducting transition, changes in the
normal-state electrical resistivity with pressure, and the dramatic
changes in the behavior of the normal-state electronic conduction
between 0.42 and 0.95 GPa strongly suggest a pressure-induced phase
transition occurs in the Li_(1 − x)M_(x)OBiS₂ compounds. In contrast to
the pressure-induced low-T_(c) to high-T_(c) phase transitions reported
in F-containing BiS₂ superconductors, the high-pressure phase observed
in this paper does not favor superconductivity. The results suggest that
fluorine plays a critical role for the pressure-induced enhancement of
T_(c) for BiS₂-based compounds. For the low-pressure phase, anomalies in
the normal-state resistivity, which seem to be pressure dependent, were
observed in the pressure range from 0.24 to 0.45 GPa. Another unusual
phenomenon observed in this paper is the tendency toward more
semiconducting behavior with increasing pressure in the high-pressure
phase at temperatures above ∼140 K. Further studies of these unusual
phenomena are expected to enrich our understanding of the physics of
solids at high pressure.
