This suggests that pressure strengthens the hybridization between the \(f\) states and conduction electrons, resulting in increased scattering at higher temperatures and the formation of a coherent ground state as temperature is lowered. The ambient pressure resistivity and a sample of the data of Wittig are plotted in the upper panel of Fig. 1. Upon increasing the pressure through the volume collapse transition, the resistance drops down over the entire temperature range from room temperature, and becomes approximately linear with temperature.[32] The disappearance of the nearly temperature independent part of the high-temperature resistivity is consistent with the picture that the \(f\) electrons delocalize, removing a source of scattering and adding charge carriers to the system. A recent investigation of the electrical resistivity of Pr metal at higher pressures (_P_ <= 32 GPa) and temperatures as low as 130 mK was carried out by Tateiwa _et al.[34]_ showing no evidence for superconductivity. Room temperature resistivity measurements to pressures as high as 179 GPa using designer diamond anvils were carried out by Velisavljevic _et al.[35]_ These measurements confirmed the ~50% drop in resistance upon transforming to the _a_-U structure and found that the resistance remained roughly constant to much higher pressures, passing through a peak near 150 GPa. This peak in resistance coincides with a transition to a distorted _a_-U crystal structure (Pr-V).[36]

The diamond anvil cell employed was a mechanically loaded commercial model based on the design by Kyowa Seisakusho Ltd. One of the anvils was a "designer diamond anvil"[37] containing four symmetrically arranged, deposited tungsten microprobes encapsulated in high-quality homoepitaxial diamond. The designer anvil was beveled with a flat diameter of 100 _m_m and a culet diameter of ~300 _m_m. The distance between two opposite leads was ~20 _m_m. The gasket was made from a 200-_m_m-thick hardened MP35N foil preindented to 30 _m_m with a 60-_m_m diameter hole electrospray drilled through the center of the preindented region. High purity praseodymium metal obtained from Ames Laboratory was removed from storage in an evacuated quartz ampoule. A thin sliver of shiny praseodymium metal was cut from the center of the rod with a razor blade and loaded into the sample chamber along with several pieces of either ruby (first experiment) or SrB4O7:Sm2+ (second experiment) manometer. The Pr was exposed to air for only several minutes and remained shiny with no visible oxidation at the time of sealing the sample chamber. No pressure medium was utilized and the sample was in direct contact with the gasket. Pressures were determined at room temperature from the fluorescence spectrum of ruby using the calibration of Chijioke _et al.[38]_ or from SrB4O7:Sm2+ using the calibration of Datchi _et al.[39]_ Pressure gradients in the sample are estimated to be as large as 20% from the full width at half-maximum of the ruby line. The diamond cell was equipped with a Delrin spacer which serves to limit changes in the pressure upon cooling from the room temperature. Pressure changes before and after cooling were minimal. The resistivity data were obtained using a Linear Research LR-700 AC resistance bridge. Low temperatures down to ~1.1 K were obtained with a home-built pumped 4He dewar while temperatures as low as ~50 mK were generated with an Oxford Kelvinox 3He-4He dilution refrigerator.

Two separate sets of high-pressure runs were performed. In the first set ("Run 1"), pressures of 41, 73, and 26 GPa were applied in that order. At each pressure, the cell was cooled to ~1.1 K and at 41 and 73 GPa, measurements were also performed down to ~50 mK. In the second set of experiments ("Run 2"), we performed measurements down to ~140 mK at 22 GPa and ~50 mK 104 GPa, followed by a measurement to ~1.1 K at 120 GPa. After the measurement at 120 GPa, we began to increase the pressure toward 160 GPa in order to perform a measurement in the Pr-V phase, but unfortunately the diamonds failed before reaching this pressure.

Figure 1 (left panel) presents the electrical resistivity over the entire temperature range and Fig. 1 (inset) highlights the low-temperature data. An estimate of the resistivity \(r\) is obtained from the resistance \(R\) using the equation \(r\) = (_p_ \(t\) _R_/ln 2), where \(t\) is the thickness of the sample.[40] The sample thickness is determined from the previously measured equation of state for Pr,[41] assuming that all of the volume change occurs in the thickness of the sample, since the diameter

  of the sample chamber is observed to remain almost constant above 20 GPa. According to this estimate, the sample thickness varies from \(\sim\)15 \(\mu\)m near 20 GPa to \(\sim\)9 \(\mu\)m at 120 GPa. Because the sample thickness is comparable to the separation of the probes, the above equation provides an inexact estimate of the conversion from resistance to resistivity. On the basis of comparison with previous three-dimensional current flow simulations of the type described in Nellis _et al._,[42] the error in our estimated resistivity could be as large as \(\pm\)50%. However, this uncertainty does not effect our conclusions and the above equation results in resistivity values that are consistent with the previously published results at lower pressures. For comparison, we have plotted the ambient pressure resistivity of Pr (James _et al.[43]_) and the resistivity at 16 GPa as measured by Wittig.[32] Wittig's data were originally reported as resistance, so we have scaled the data according to the measured equation of state and the known ambient pressure resistivity.

The noise for the data at the lowest temperatures is somewhat higher due to the lower excitation current required to ensure that no spurious heating effects were present. The measurements at 22 and 26 GPa show behavior characteristic of the precollapsed phase, while all of the measurements at higher pressures show typical metallic behavior all the way to the lowest measured temperatures. We note that other authors have also found the precollapsed phase persisting to \(\sim\)25 GPa.[44] The measurement at 41 GPa shows a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of \(\sim\)30; a value quite close to that observed by Wittig near 23 GPa.[32] These somewhat large RRR values under nonhydrostatic pressure could be related to a rather low shear strength of Pr. At the lowest temperatures, the resistivity becomes flat and exhibits no trace of superconductivity.

The right panel of Fig. 1 presents the pressure dependence of the resistivity at 1 K (triangles) and 200 K (circles) for both Run 1 (filled symbols) and Run 2 (open symbols). The errors bars correspond to the 50% error in the conversion from resistance to resistivity described above. The initial pressure dependence of the resistivity in the precollapsed phases (\(P\lesssim 25\)) GPa is difficult to resolve given the sparsity of data points and magnitude of the uncertainty. However, our data are consistent with earlier reports[32, 35] that found an initial increase in the resistivity within this low-pressure region. This initial increase in resistivity may be attributed to enhanced scattering due to an increase in hybridization between the conduction and 4\(f\) electrons. The precipitous drop in resistivity over the entire temperature interval at the Pr III \(\rightarrow\) Pr IV transition (\(P\sim 25\) GPa) is discussed in the introduction. At still higher pressures, the resistivity at 200 K becomes only weakly pressure dependent. However, the resistivity at 1 K exhibits a strong increase with pressure beginning at 41 GPa. While some caution must be exercised in comparing data from Run 1 and Run 2, the increase in the residual resistivity above 41 GPa is substantial enough that it cannot be accounted for by measurement uncertainty. A simple explanation for this increase is growing defect scattering as the sample is cold worked under nonhydrostatic pressure conditions, though a more profound explanation, such as scattering due to a still increasing hybridization between the conduction electrons and incompletely delocalized 4\(f\) electrons, cannot be ruled out.

It is interesting to directly compare the behavior of Ce, Pr, and U, all of which adopt the same low symmetry \(\alpha\)-U crystal structure at high pressure. Within the \(\alpha\)-Ce structure, the room temperature magnetic susceptibility is known to drop steadily with pressure,[10] while the superconducting \(T_{c}\) exhibits a modest increase with pressure.[13, 14] An extrapolation of the susceptibility to the pressure at which Ce completes its transition to \(\alpha^{\prime}\)-Ce (\(\alpha\)-U structure) results in a value nearly the same as that observed for the tetravalent elements Hf and Th. Thus, by the time Ce transitions to \(\alpha^{\prime}\)-Ce, the 4\(f\) magnetic moment appears to be mostly destroyed. Upon transforming to \(\alpha^{\prime}\)-Ce, \(T_{c}\) jumps from 50 mK to 1.9 K, so the \(\alpha\)-U structure seems to be comparatively favorable for superconductivity. However, within this phase, further pressure increases only lead to a gradual decline in \(T_{c}\). The \(T_{c}\) of \(\alpha\)-U metal itself is either low or vanishing at ambient pressure, and passes through a broad dome, reaching about 2.4 K at 1.2 GPa.[45, 46] The increase in the \(T_{c}\) of U appears to be connected to the suppression of several charge density wave transitions which lead to a partial gapping of the Fermi surface. Within a Bilbro-McMillan[47] type interpretation, as the charge density wave transitions are suppressed, the fraction of the Fermi surface available to the superconducting state grows, leading to the increase in \(T_{c}\). The maximum in \(T_{c}\) appears to roughly coincide with the pressure at which the final charge density wave transition has been destroyed. Further pressure increase then lowers \(T_{c}\). Thus, for both Ce and U in the \(\alpha\)-U structure, in the absence of other factors, pressure seems to depress superconductivity.

One possible explanation for the lack of pressure-induced superconductivity in Pr is that sufficiently strong magnetism persists throughout the region where superconductivity might otherwise develop. To date, little information about the magnetic properties of Pr at high pressure is available. X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) measurements under pressures up to 42 GPa show no evidence for any change in the spectral parameters across the Pr III \(\rightarrow\) Pr IV transition.[48] Similar XES results are found for the \(\gamma\rightarrow\alpha\) transition of Ce, as well as for Nd which does not show a volume discontinuity.[48] These results are consistent with a Kondo-like scenario, in which the 4\(f\) moments become screened by conduction electrons. Within this scenario, there can be a continuum of behavior spanning the range from magnetic to nonmagnetic. As mentioned in the introduction, this behavior can also be viewed as a delocalization of the \(f\) electrons. Although the volume collapse transition seems to represent an abrupt increase in screening, the \(f\) state may continue to strongly impact the magnetic properties in the collapsed phase. Ce is a prime example of this behavior, where the susceptibility exhibits a large exchange enhancement in the \(\alpha\)-phase that probably contributes to the very low \(T_{c}\).[10] A similar situation may occur in Pr under pressure, so that, after transforming to the \(\alpha\)-U structure, the screening (or delocalization) of the \(f\) state is still incomplete. The appearance of superconductivity in Pr would, therefore, hinge on whether the \(f\) moments become sufficiently screened before superconductivity is precluded by the "intrinsic" negative pressure dependence of \(T_{c}\) in the \(\alpha\)-U structure discussed in the preceding paragraph.

In summary, we have carried out electrical resistivity measurements on Pr metal under high pressures and temperatures down to \(\sim\)50 mK using designer diamond anvils. Unlike Ce metal, Pr does not appear to exhibit superconductivity in the  collapsed phase up to at least 120 GPa. A possible explanation is that superconductivity is precluded by incomplete screening/delocalization of the \(f\) state. Direct measurements of the magnetic susceptibility under pressure could help to clarify the situation.

* (12) For years, there was a controversy about whether \(\alpha^{\prime}\)-Ce adopts the \(\alpha\)-U structure or a monoclinic C2/\(m\) structure, with various authors reporting conflicting results. M. I. McMahon and R. J. Nelmes (Phys. Rev. Lett. **78**, 3884, 1997) showed that the monoclinic \(C2/m\) structure forms only in samples made from filed or otherwise cold worked samples. Compressing cerium that has not been subjected to this type of cold working produces the \(\alpha\)-U form. Since the samples used for measurements of the superconducting transition involved samples that were not subjected to such cold working, the superconducting behavior of \(\alpha^{\prime}\)-Ce should correspond to the \(\alpha\)-U structure.
