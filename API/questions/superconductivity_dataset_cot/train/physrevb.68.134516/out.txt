2 May 200  was reacted in flowing nitrogen at 1010 degC for 12 h. Sintering was performed at 1050 degC for 4 days in flowing oxygen, followed by cooling at a rate of 45 degC/h. The room-temperature x-ray diffraction patterns were collected in an automatic Rygaku powder diffractometer in step-scanning mode (20deg  2 O  80deg). Bars of approximately 1 x 1 x 12 mm3 were cut. The dc resistivity (four-probe method) was measured from RT down to 4.2 K in a computer data-logger system, using a Keithley 224 high-precision current source and a Keithley 181 nanovoltmeter. Isothermal magnetization at 5 K up to 5 T and dc magnetic susceptibility measurements at 5 Oe were performed in a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. The Mossbauer spectra (MS) were collected from RT down to 4.2 K in transmission geometry using a conventional spectrometer in constant acceleration mode and a BaSnO3 source, to which the obtained isomer shift (_d_) values are referred. From a calibration spectrum using a Sn foil a linewidth (full width at half maximum) G = 1.14 mm/s was obtained.

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns for the parent compound (a) and for the two extremes of the doped (Ru1-xSn3)Sr2GdCu2O8 series, with x = 0.05 (b) and x = 0.30 (c). No spurious lines were observed for x = 0, 0.05, and 0.10. There was no evidence of the itinerant ferromagnet SrRuO3 in any of the samples: however, the cubic nonmagnetic perovskite SrSnO3 [intensity lines indicated by dots in Fig. 1(c)] was detected for the samples with x = 0.20 and 0.30.

The magnetic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The coercive fields _H_co and the remanent moments m_{r} , as determined from the hysteresis loops at 5 K, decrease regularly with the increase in Sn content. Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity for the samples with x = 0.05 and 0.30. The onset superconducting transition temperatures T_{C} , taken as the maxima in the resistivity curves, were 33 and 11 K, respectively. Both values are lower than T_{C} for RuSr2GdCu2O8 (45 K). We note that the normal-state resistivity is lower for x = 0.30. The inset in Fig. 2 shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility for the sample with x = 0.05, with a magnetic transition temperature T_{M} = 123 K (maximum in the derivative). The relevant point from these results is that the superconducting transition is preserved even for high effective Sn concentrations in the Ru-(1212) matrix. This again is consistent with Sn substituting Ru, since superconductivity is strongly affected in conventional cuprates when Sn replaces Cu in the CuO2 layers [13], reaching a complete suppression of T_{C} already for x = 0.03. Probably the long final sintering precludes cation intermixing between Ru and Sn with Cu. In summary, structural, magnetic, and resistivity measurements suggest that Sn occupies Ru sites.

Figure 3 shows the MS at RT obtained for the samples with x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30. We analyzed our data with one symmetric doublet (site I) and a single line (site II). The results are summarized in Table 2. The first point to consider is the origin of the singlet observed in the MS for the samples with nominal concentrations x = 0.05 and 0.10. The almost vanishing isomer shift with respect to the BaSnO3 source suggests the presence of SrSnO3 . We believe that a small amount of this compound, undetectable from XRD experiments, but giving a sizable signal to the MS, is the origin of the singlet. The fact that for x = 0.20 and 0.30 the lines of SrSnO3 become detectable in the diffraction patterns agrees with this idea. The rest of the Sn atoms is assumed to enter into the Ru-(1212) matrix, and the effective Sn content _x_eff for the nominal concentrations x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30 are _x_eff = 0.045, 0.074, 0.10, and 0.14, respec

  tively. Here we have assumed that the Debye-Waller factors of the doublet and singlet are the same at RT. This assumption is supported by the fact that the absorption area ratio between the doublet and singlet does not change going from RT to 4.2 K (see below). The values of the quadrupole splittings (D_E__q_) of the doublet for the Ru-(1212) system are higher than for SnO2 and similar to those obtained for Sn-doped conventional cuprates.

A set of MS was collected for the x = 0.05 sample between RT and 4.2 K as can be seen in Fig. 4. The broadened spectrum obtained at 123 K is an indication that a transferred magnetic hyperfine field (B_{H}) starts to appear at this temperature. On cooling below T_{M} = 123 K there is a continuous evolution towards a defined magnetic structure. This T_{M} value corresponds to the one obtained from the bulk magnetic transition temperatures. This is a strong indication that the Sn nuclei are sensing the long-range order of the Ru moments.

Figure 5(a) shows the MS collected at 4.2 K for samples with different x values. In order to fit these spectra three components were needed: (1) the singlet already present in the RT spectra, (2) a quadrupole doublet, and (3) a magnetically split spectrum. The latter was fitted with a magnetic hyperfine field distribution _P_(B_{H}). The corresponding _P_(B_{H}) distributions are shown in Fig. 5(b), with maximum

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}  & & \delta & \Delta E_{q} & A \\ x & Sites & (mm/s) & (mm/s) & (\%) \\  & I & 0.19(2) & 1.21(5) & 90 \\
0.05 & II & -0.02(2) & & 10 \\  & I & 0.16(3) & 1.12(2) & 74 \\
0.10 & II & 0.00(2) & & 26 \\  & I & 0.16(3) & 1.11(2) & 51 \\
0.20 & II & -0.01(2) & & 49 \\  & I & 0.16(3) &  near 4 T. No correlation was imposed between d and \Delta E_{q} with the hyperfine field _B_hf and the linewidths were kept as in the RT spectra. The local electric field gradient was assumed to be axially symmetric. Using the relation \Delta_{\rm eff} =\Delta E_{q}(3\cos^{2}\Theta - 1)/2, the average values for \Delta_{\rm eff} as obtained from the field distribution fitting, and the \Delta E_{q} values as obtained from the RT spectra, we calculate an average angle \Theta_{xy} \cong 78^{\circ} \pm 10^{\circ}. Therefore, we conclude that the ferromagnetic component of the canted antiferromagnetically ordered Ru moments is oriented along the _a,b_ plane (RuO2 plane), as determined from previous neutron diffraction measurements.[14] And recent NMR studies on RuY-(1212) have also indicated that a magnetic ordering with a ferromagnetic component occurs in the RuO2 plane.[15]

Table III shows the results from these fits. From the d values and relative absorption areas we conclude that the single line is the same as that observed at RT--namely, the impurity line due to SrSnO3. Analogously, the magnetic spectrum and the doublet found at low temperatures develop from the doublet (site I) at RT. This is most evident from the sum of the relative absorption areas of the magnetic components (called site Im) and nonmagnetic doublet (called site Inm), which is in reasonable agreement with the relative absorption area of the doublet (site I) at RT (see Table II).

The two main mechanisms for a transferred hyperfine field at the nucleus of a diamagnetic probe are the following:[16] (1) transfer of spin density from the d orbitals of the magnetic neighboring cations to the s orbitals of the probing one through the covalent bonding with the oxygen atoms and (2) overlap of the polarized 2s and 2p electrons of the oxide with the core s orbital of the diamagnetic atom. The observed \langle B_{\rm hf}\rangle values in our samples are comparable to the transferred fields at Sn sites in Sn:YBCO and Sn:LSCO systems with nonoptimum hole doping. In those compounds,

Figure 5: 119Sn-Mössbauer spectra at 4.2 K for the (Ru1−_x_Sn2)Sr2GdCu2O8 system with nominal x values (a). The spectra were fitted using a symmetric doublet, a singlet, and a magnetic split spectrum with a hyperfine field distribution _P_(_B_hf) (b). See Table III for results.

  this field has been associated with different degrees of stiffness of the Cu 3_d_-spin sublattice, such as a slow-down rate in the fluctuations [13] or the emergence of a glassy state, [17, 18] or even the onset of long-range magnetic order. [19] In our samples, the transferred field at the Sn sites is due to the long-range order of the neighboring Ru magnetic moments.

As already mentioned above, the sum of the relative areas of the magnetic and nonmagnetic component at 4.2 K is equal to the relative area of doublet (site I) at RT. Furthermore, both components (site I_{\rm m} and site I_{\rm nm}) have the same isomer shift (see Table 3). This indicates that the magnetic fraction and the fraction of the Sn species giving the nonmagnetic doublet have the same origin--namely, are due to Sn sites in the RuO_{2} layer. White the magnetic fraction sees a transferred hyperfine field, the nonmagnetic doublet at T = 4.2 K comes from Sn sites in the RuO_{2} layers, which do not sense a transferred hyperfine field. This certainly is the case for Sn sites with no Ru magnetic ions in the four in-plane nearest cation positions of the Ru-(1212) structure. [20] However, the probability of this neighborhood is extremely low for all samples and can not account for the effective areas observed for the nonmagnetic doublet. Effects leading to a net zero transferred field, such as spin fluctuations with frequencies larger than the inverse of the lifetime of the excited state of the ^{119}Sn nucleus (5.6\times10^{7} s^{-1}), should also be considered. Configurations with three or fewer Ru magnetic ions as nearest cation neighbors around a central Sn atom may exhibit such an effect. A calculation of the probability of finding specific nearest-neighbor configurations helps to clarify this point. If we assume that the Sn atoms distribute at random in the (Ru, Sn)O_{2} planes, the probability of finding n Sn atoms as nearest cation neighbors is given by P(n) = P(4n)(1 - x_{\rm eff})^{4 - n}x_{\rm eff}^{4}, where P(4n) = 4!/(4 - n)!n!. For _x_eff = 0.045 we obtain P(0) = 0.83 and P(1) = 0.15: i.e., 98% of the total possible configurations correspond to n = 0 and 1 or to Sn atoms with four and three Ru ions as the nearest neighbors. These values match reasonably well with the effective absorption areas of the magnetic contribution (0.89) and the doublet at 4.2 K (0.11). According to our approach, these results suggest that the Sn atoms at the Ru sites with one Sn as the nearest neighbor are affected by fluctuation effects at 4.2 K. For the sample with _x_eff =0.074, the configurations with n = 0 and 1 still represent a large fraction of the total possible neighborhoods (96%) and a good agreement again is obtained between P(0) = 0.73 and P(1) = 0.23 and the effective areas of the magnetic component (0.78) and the doublet (0.22).

Actually, not only the number of Ru ions as the nearest-neighbor cations is relevant, but also how their spins are connected to the chain of exchange interactions. This fact becomes more relevant as the dilution of the spin system proceeds with increase in the Sn content, making the comparison between the P(n) probabilities and the relative areas less direct. The decrease in the average transferred hyperfine field observed with the increase in _x_eff (see Fig. 6) reflects the gradual disruption of the exchange network.

The determination of the _in-plane_ magnetic field just at the RuO_{2} layers is quite relevant for theories on the coexistence of superconductivity (SC) and ferromagnetism (FM) in

  the ruthenocuprates. Since in these compounds the long-range magnetic order is established at T_{M}^{9\!\!>}T_{C}, SC onsets are well within the canted AF state leading to a weak ferromagnetism state. This situation has led to Fulde-Farrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov- (FFLO-) type theories,[21] where the SC and FM order parameters exhibit spatial variations to accommodate each other. According to _nanoscale_ theory for SC-FM superlattices, the so called \pi-phase SC order parameter changes its phase by \pi from one SC layer (CuO_{2} planes in our case) to another, with a node at the FM intermediary one (RuO_{2} planes). This will strongly decrease the pair-breaking effect expected from the magnetic order, allowing the onset of a bulk coherent SC state along c axis.[22] However, a \pi phase has been predicted to occur only if the FM layer fulfills two requirements: (a) it must be extremely thin and (b) a certain critical high value of the magnetization _in the layer_ must be exceeded.[23] Similar results have been recently obtained for superconducting-antiferromagnetic interfaces, concerning the exchange field in the AF layer.[24] Since the ruthenocuprates represent the first atomic-scale SC-FM or SC-AF system (ferromagnetic canting of a long-range AF order or ferrimagnetic order of Ru^{4\,+} and Ru^{5\,+} states), the first point is satisfactorily accomplished (\sim2 A for the RuO_{2} layer). The second one seems to require a more careful consideration, because local fields of only \sim600-700 Oe have been determined at the Gd site by electron spin resonance (ESR) (Ref. [25]) and at the muon site in \mu\,^{+}SR measurements[4] (the so-called "apical site" of the structure, as in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}). However, exchange fields may be relevant, and the magnetization at the RuO_{2} layer might be considerably higher. Our extrapolated value of \sim4.9 T at 4.2 K for the average field at the Sn sites gives an _on-site_ estimation of the _in-plane_ field in the RuO_{2} layers, which can be considered as a lower limit, due to its transferred nature. Since Sn carries no atomic moment, the interpretation of this field is more straightforward than in the case for ^{57}Fe-Mossbauer studies, where a comparison between the Ru-Fe and Ru-Ru exchange strengths is needed.[26]

Since the strength of the SC coupling between the CuO_{2} planes is not known, the threshold value for the _in-plane_ field cannot be determined, but our results could indicate that \pi-phase formation may be favored in the Ru-(1212) system.

## IV Conclusions

^{119}Sn-Mossbauer spectra have been measured in the Sn:Ru-(1212) system. We have provided evidence indicating that Ru is substituted by Sn^{4\,+} ions at the RuO_{2} layers. Effective Sn concentrations as high as around 15 at.% were obtained. The Sn nuclei sense an _in-plane_ transferred hyperfine field which is two orders of magnitude higher than the fields measured by other techniques at _out-of-plane_ sites. Our indirect estimation of the _in-plane_ field at the RuO_{2} layers may be indicative of the emergence of a \pi-phase state for the superconducting order parameter across the magnetically ordered planes, with low pair-breaking effects. Spin fluctuations effects are proposed to account for a remaining doublet at low temperatures. No signature of distinct states of valence for the Ru ions was detected via the quadrupole interaction. The perpendicular orientation of the transferred field with respect to the c axis confirms that a magnetic ordering with a ferromagnetic component exists in the RuO_{2} planes.

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns for the parent compound (a) and for the two extremes of the doped (Ru1-xSn3)Sr2GdCu2O8 series, with x = 0.05 (b) and x = 0.30 (c). No spurious lines were observed for x = 0, 0.05, and 0.10. There was no evidence of the itinerant ferromagnet SrRuO3 in any of the samples: however, the cubic nonmagnetic perovskite SrSnO3 [intensity lines indicated by dots in Fig. 1(c)] was detected for the samples with x = 0.20 and 0.30.

The magnetic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The coercive fields _H_co and the remanent moments m_{r} , as determined from the hysteresis loops at 5 K, decrease regularly with the increase in Sn content. Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity for the samples with x = 0.05 and 0.30. The onset superconducting transition temperatures T_{C} , taken as the maxima in the resistivity curves, were 33 and 11 K, respectively. Both values are lower than T_{C} for RuSr2GdCu2O8 (45 K). We note that the normal-state resistivity is lower for x = 0.30. The inset in Fig. 2 shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility for the sample with x = 0.05, with a magnetic transition temperature T_{M} = 123 K (maximum in the derivative). The relevant point from these results is that the superconducting transition is preserved even for high effective Sn concentrations in the Ru-(1212) matrix. This again is consistent with Sn substituting Ru, since superconductivity is strongly affected in conventional cuprates when Sn replaces Cu in the CuO2 layers [13], reaching a complete suppression of T_{C} already for x = 0.03. Probably the long final sintering precludes cation intermixing between Ru and Sn with Cu. In summary, structural, magnetic, and resistivity measurements suggest that Sn occupies Ru sites.

Figure 3 shows the MS at RT obtained for the samples with x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30. We analyzed our data with one symmetric doublet (site I) and a single line (site II). The results are summarized in Table 2. The first point to consider is the origin of the singlet observed in the MS for the samples with nominal concentrations x = 0.05 and 0.10. The almost vanishing isomer shift with respect to the BaSnO3 source suggests the presence of SrSnO3 . We believe that a small amount of this compound, undetectable from XRD experiments, but giving a sizable signal to the MS, is the origin of the singlet. The fact that for x = 0.20 and 0.30 the lines of SrSnO3 become detectable in the diffraction patterns agrees with this idea. The rest of the Sn atoms is assumed to enter into the Ru-(1212) matrix, and the effective Sn content _x_eff for the nominal concentrations x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30 are _x_eff = 0.045, 0.074, 0.10, and 0.14, respec

  tively. Here we have assumed that the Debye-Waller factors of the doublet and singlet are the same at RT. This assumption is supported by the fact that the absorption area ratio between the doublet and singlet does not change going from RT to 4.2 K (see below). The values of the quadrupole splittings (D_E__q_) of the doublet for the Ru-(1212) system are higher than for SnO2 and similar to those obtained for Sn-doped conventional cuprates.

A set of MS was collected for the x = 0.05 sample between RT and 4.2 K as can be seen in Fig. 4. The broadened spectrum obtained at 123 K is an indication that a transferred magnetic hyperfine field (B_{H}) starts to appear at this temperature. On cooling below T_{M} = 123 K there is a continuous evolution towards a defined magnetic structure. This T_{M} value corresponds to the one obtained from the bulk magnetic transition temperatures. This is a strong indication that the Sn nuclei are sensing the long-range order of the Ru moments.

Figure 5(a) shows the MS collected at 4.2 K for samples with different x values. In order to fit these spectra three components were needed: (1) the singlet already present in the RT spectra, (2) a quadrupole doublet, and (3) a magnetically split spectrum. The latter was fitted with a magnetic hyperfine field distribution _P_(B_{H}). The corresponding _P_(B_{H}) distributions are shown in Fig. 5(b), with maximum

The local electric field gradient was assumed to be axially symmetric. Using the relation \Delta_{\rm eff} =\Delta E_{q}(3\cos^{2}\Theta - 1)/2, the average values for \Delta_{\rm eff} as obtained from the field distribution fitting, and the \Delta E_{q} values as obtained from the RT spectra, we calculate an average angle \Theta_{xy} \cong 78^{\circ} \pm 10^{\circ}. Therefore, we conclude that the ferromagnetic component of the canted antiferromagnetically ordered Ru moments is oriented along the _a,b_ plane (RuO2 plane), as determined from previous neutron diffraction measurements.[14] And recent NMR studies on RuY-(1212) have also indicated that a magnetic ordering with a ferromagnetic component occurs in the RuO2 plane.[15]

Table III shows the results from these fits. From the d values and relative absorption areas we conclude that the single line is the same as that observed at RT--namely, the impurity line due to SrSnO3. Analogously, the magnetic spectrum and the doublet found at low temperatures develop from the doublet (site I) at RT. This is most evident from the sum of the relative absorption areas of the magnetic components (called site Im) and nonmagnetic doublet (called site Inm), which is in reasonable agreement with the relative absorption area of the doublet (site I) at RT (see Table II).

The two main mechanisms for a transferred hyperfine field at the nucleus of a diamagnetic probe are the following:[16] (1) transfer of spin density from the d orbitals of the magnetic neighboring cations to the s orbitals of the probing one through the covalent bonding with the oxygen atoms and (2) overlap of the polarized 2s and 2p electrons of the oxide with the core s orbital of the diamagnetic atom. The observed \langle B_{\rm hf}\rangle values in our samples are comparable to the transferred fields at Sn sites in Sn:YBCO and Sn:LSCO systems with nonoptimum hole doping. In those compounds,

Figure 5: 119Sn-Mössbauer spectra at 4.2 K for the (Ru1−_x_Sn2)Sr2GdCu2O8 system with nominal x values (a). The spectra were fitted using a symmetric doublet, a singlet, and a magnetic split spectrum with a hyperfine field distribution _P_(_B_hf) (b). See Table III for results.

  this field has been associated with different degrees of stiffness of the Cu 3_d_-spin sublattice, such as a slow-down rate in the fluctuations [13] or the emergence of a glassy state, [17, 18] or even the onset of long-range magnetic order. [19] In our samples, the transferred field at the Sn sites is due to the long-range order of the neighboring Ru magnetic moments.

As already mentioned above, the sum of the relative areas of the magnetic and nonmagnetic component at 4.2 K is equal to the relative area of doublet (site I) at RT. Furthermore, both components (site I_{\rm m} and site I_{\rm nm}) have the same isomer shift (see Table 3). This indicates that the magnetic fraction and the fraction of the Sn species giving the nonmagnetic doublet have the same origin--namely, are due to Sn sites in the RuO_{2} layer. White the magnetic fraction sees a transferred hyperfine field, the nonmagnetic doublet at T = 4.2 K comes from Sn sites in the RuO_{2} layers, which do not sense a transferred hyperfine field. This certainly is the case for Sn sites with no Ru magnetic ions in the four in-plane nearest cation positions of the Ru-(1212) structure. [20] However, the probability of this neighborhood is extremely low for all samples and can not account for the effective areas observed for the nonmagnetic doublet. Effects leading to a net zero transferred field, such as spin fluctuations with frequencies larger than the inverse of the lifetime of the excited state of the ^{119}Sn nucleus (5.6\times10^{7} s^{-1}), should also be considered. Configurations with three or fewer Ru magnetic ions as nearest cation neighbors around a central Sn atom may exhibit such an effect. A calculation of the probability of finding specific nearest-neighbor configurations helps to clarify this point. If we assume that the Sn atoms distribute at random in the (Ru, Sn)O_{2} planes, the probability of finding n Sn atoms as nearest cation neighbors is given by P(n) = P(4n)(1 - x_{\rm eff})^{4 - n}x_{\rm eff}^{4}, where P(4n) = 4!/(4 - n)!n!. For _x_eff = 0.045 we obtain P(0) = 0.83 and P(1) = 0.15: i.e., 98% of the total possible configurations correspond to n = 0 and 1 or to Sn atoms with four and three Ru ions as the nearest neighbors. These values match reasonably well with the effective absorption areas of the magnetic contribution (0.89) and the doublet at 4.2 K (0.11). According to our approach, these results suggest that the Sn atoms at the Ru sites with one Sn as the nearest neighbor are affected by fluctuation effects at 4.2 K. For the sample with _x_eff =0.074, the configurations with n = 0 and 1 still represent a large fraction of the total possible neighborhoods (96%) and a good agreement again is obtained between P(0) = 0.73 and P(1) = 0.23 and the effective areas of the magnetic component (0.78) and the doublet (0.22).

Actually, not only the number of Ru ions as the nearest-neighbor cations is relevant, but also how their spins are connected to the chain of exchange interactions. This fact becomes more relevant as the dilution of the spin system proceeds with increase in the Sn content, making the comparison between the P(n) probabilities and the relative areas less direct. The decrease in the average transferred hyperfine field observed with the increase in _x_eff (see Fig. 6) reflects the gradual disruption of the exchange network.

The determination of the _in-plane_ magnetic field just at the RuO_{2} layers is quite relevant for theories on the coexistence of superconductivity (SC) and ferromagnetism (FM) in

  the ruthenocuprates. Since in these compounds the long-range magnetic order is established at T_{M}^{9\!\!>}T_{C}, SC onsets are well within the canted AF state leading to a weak ferromagnetism state. This situation has led to Fulde-Farrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov- (FFLO-) type theories,[21] where the SC and FM order parameters exhibit spatial variations to accommodate each other. According to _nanoscale_ theory for SC-FM superlattices, the so called \pi-phase SC order parameter changes its phase by \pi from one SC layer (CuO_{2} planes in our case) to another, with a node at the FM intermediary one (RuO_{2} planes). This will strongly decrease the pair-breaking effect expected from the magnetic order, allowing the onset of a bulk coherent SC state along c axis.[22] However, a \pi phase has been predicted to occur only if the FM layer fulfills two requirements: (a) it must be extremely thin and (b) a certain critical high value of the magnetization _in the layer_ must be exceeded.[23] Similar results have been recently obtained for superconducting-antiferromagnetic interfaces, concerning the exchange field in the AF layer.[24] Since the ruthenocuprates represent the first atomic-scale SC-FM or SC-AF system (ferromagnetic canting of a long-range AF order or ferrimagnetic order of Ru^{4\,+} and Ru^{5\,+} states), the first point is satisfactorily accomplished (\sim2 A for the RuO_{2} layer). The second one seems to require a more careful consideration, because local fields of only \sim600-700 Oe have been determined at the Gd site by electron spin resonance (ESR) (Ref. [25]) and at the muon site in \mu\,^{+}SR measurements[4] (the so-called "apical site" of the structure, as in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}). However, exchange fields may be relevant, and the magnetization at the RuO_{2} layer might be considerably higher. Our extrapolated value of \sim4.9 T at 4.2 K for the average field at the Sn sites gives an _on-site_ estimation of the _in-plane_ field in the RuO_{2} layers, which can be considered as a lower limit, due to its transferred nature. Since Sn carries no atomic moment, the interpretation of this field is more straightforward than in the case for ^{57}Fe-Mossbauer studies, where a comparison between the Ru-Fe and Ru-Ru exchange strengths is needed.[26]

Since the strength of the SC coupling between the CuO_{2} planes is not known, the threshold value for the _in-plane_ field cannot be determined, but our results could indicate that \pi-phase formation may be favored in the Ru-(1212) system.

## IV Conclusions

^{119}Sn-Mossbauer spectra have been measured in the Sn:Ru-(1212) system. We have provided evidence indicating that Ru is substituted by Sn^{4\,+} ions at the RuO_{2} layers. Effective Sn concentrations as high as around 15 at.% were obtained. The Sn nuclei sense an _in-plane_ transferred hyperfine field which is two orders of magnitude higher than the fields measured by other techniques at _out-of-plane_ sites. Our indirect estimation of the _in-plane_ field at the RuO_{2} layers may be indicative of the emergence of a \pi-phase state for the superconducting order parameter across the magnetically ordered planes, with low pair-breaking effects. Spin fluctuations effects are proposed to account for a remaining doublet at low temperatures. No signature of distinct states of valence for the Ru ions was detected via the quadrupole interaction. The perpendicular orientation of the transferred field with respect to the c axis confirms that a magnetic ordering with a ferromagnetic component exists in the RuO_{2} planes.
