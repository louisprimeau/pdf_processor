###### Abstract

Both the Hall coefficient (\(R_{H}\)) and the thermoelectric-power coefficient (\(S\)) have been measured using the same polycrystalline samples of superconducting Nd\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4-x}\)F\({}_{x}\) (0 \(\leq\) \(x\) \(\leq\) 0.3). For the samples with 0.1 \(\leq\) \(x\) \(\leq\) 0.3, the \(R_{H}\) of every sample is found to be negative in the temperature range between 30 and 275 K. Furthermore, as \(x\) increases, the charge-carrier density (\(p_{H}\)) estimated from \(R_{H}\) at 100 K increases in proportion to \(x\) (\(p_{H}\) = _x_) up to around 0.18, then much more rapidly for \(x\) \(\geq\) 0.18. On the other hand, the \(S\) of every sample is also found to be negative in the temperature range between 30 and 300 K. The absolute value of \(S\) is found to reduce with \(x\) up to around 0.18 and then level off to a constant value as \(x\) increases further to 0.3. The decrease in \(|S|\) due to F doping is discussed using a semiconductor model. In addition, we point out a possibility that a magnon drag plays a significant role in \(S\) for samples with \(x\) \(<\) 0.18.

## 1 Introduction

The occurrence of superconductivity in \(L_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4-x}\)F\({}_{x}\) (_L_ = Nd and Pr) (Ref. [1]) exhibited the possibility of a control of charge-carrier density by anion substitution in the high-\(T_{c}\) superconducting cuprates. Nevertheless, at this moment, superconductivity caused by anion substitution has been observed only in these compounds.

Recently, several reports [2]\({}^{-}\)[6] have shown that the structural and physical properties of Nd\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4-x}\)F\({}_{x}\) were parallel to those of Nd\({}_{2-y}\)Ce\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\). That is, the Hall coefficient (\(R_{H}\)) of Nd\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4-x}\)F\({}_{x}\) (_x_ = 0.1, 0.16, 0.2, and 0.3) was negative in the temperature range between 30 and 275 K. [3] In addition, the temperature dependence of \(R_{H}\) was similar to the case of Nd\({}_{2-y}\)Ce\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\). [4] Hence this compound was considered to be an "\(n\)-type" superconductor. However, to our knowledge, all the data for Nd\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4-x}\)F\({}_{x}\) were measured using polycrystalline samples. Thus the data might include the effects of grain boundaries and/or coexisting secondary phases.

On the other hand, it is well known that the thermoelectric power (\(S\)) is often less affected by sample imperfections. Additionally, the analysis of the temperature dependence of \(S\) in the normal state can provide information on the scattering mechanism of the charge carriers. Therefore the measurement of \(S\) is one of the essential experiments to investigate changes in the charge-carrier density and electronic structure due to \(F\) doping. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, the data of \(S\) for Nd\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4-x}\)F\({}_{x}\) have not been reported, except that James, Zahurak, and Murphy mentioned [1] that the values of \(S\) were negative at room temperature. For Nd\({}_{2-y}\)Ce\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\), some groups reported the results of the \(S\) measurements. [8, 9] For all the samples, \(S\) was small and nearly independent of temperature in the range between 100 and 250 K, although either sign of \(S\) were observed.

Furthermore, the detailed relationship between \(R_{H}\) and fluorine content is useful for understanding the change in the charge-carrier density, even for polycrystalline samples. In this paper we report both the Hall and thermoelectric-power coefficients measured using the same samples of polycrystalline superconducting Nd\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4-x}\)F\({}_{x}\). In addition, we discuss the relationship between the charges in \(R_{H}\) and \(S\) due to F doping.

## 2 Experiment

Polycrystalline samples of Nd\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4-x}\)F\({}_{x}\) (0 and 0.1 \(\leq\) \(x\) \(\leq\) 0.3) were synthesized by a conventional solid-state reaction technique. Stoichiometric mixtures of the starting materials, such as Nd\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), CuO, and NdF\({}_{3}\), were mixed throughly by a planetary ball mill using ethanol as solvent. After drying, the mixtures were calcined at 860 degC for 10 h in a 20% O\({}_{2}\)-Ar gas mixture flow. After regrinding, the calcined power was pressed into rectangular bars and sintered at 1100 degC for 14 h in a 1% O\({}_{2}\)-Ar gas mixture flow. Then the samples were annealed at 910 degC for 14 h in a nitrogen gas flow and furnace cooled to room temperature at a rate of about 5 degC/min.

From powder x-ray-diffraction (XRD) analysis, [2] all the samples with \(x\) \(<\) 0.3 were found to be a single phase of the Nd\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\)-type tetragonal structure. On the contrary, the diffraction patterns for the samples with \(x\) \(\geq\) 0.3 included weak peaks due to NdOF and CuO and unidentified phases besides those for the Nd\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4-x}\)F\({}_{x}\) phase. Thus the maximum fluorine solubility was found to be _x_cr = 0.3. Electron-probe-microanalysis (EPMA) observations supported these results. The chemical analysis for the fluorine content in the samples with \(x\) = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 showed that the F content of each sample was reduced to ~85% of the nominal content after heat treatment of the sample. [3] (Henceforth, the quantity \(x\) always represents a nominal composition.) Electrical-resistivity and magnetic-susceptibility measurements indicated that the values of _T_c,on were ~27 K for the samples with \(x\) \(\geq\) 0.12, though the zero-resistance  states were observed only for the samples with \(x\) >= 0.2. The highest value of \(T_{c}\),zero was observed at 22 K for the sample with \(x\) = 0.22. The preparation and structural and superconducting properties of the samples were described in detail elsewhere.2,3

Hall-coefficient measurements were carried out for thin rectangular plate samples in a constant magnetic field of \(H\) = 8T at temperatures between 20 and 275 K. The sample dimensions were about 120 _m_m thickness, 2.5 mm width, and 6 mm length. Electrical contacts with resistance under 1 O were made with indium using an ultrasonic soldering iron. The dc-current density, applied within the plate, was about 20 A/cm2.

The thermoelectric-power coefficient was measured by a dc method in the temperature range between 30 and 310 K using the same sample for the Hall-coefficient measurement. The temperature gradient (D_T_) in the sample was measured using the two pairs of copper-Constantan thermocouples. These thermocouples were attached by silver epoxy on the indium electrodes on the sample. The magnitude of D_T_ was kept 0.3-0.4 K during the measurement. To eliminate the effects of the reference leads (Cu wires), the absolute thermoelectric power of Cu was subtracted from the measured thermoelectric voltage.

## III Results

### Resistivity and Hall coefficient

The temperature dependences of the resistivity (_r_) and the Hall coefficient (_RH_) are shown in Figs. 1(a) - 1(d) for the Nd2CuO4-_x_F_x (0.1 <= \(x\) <= 0.3) samples. The value of _RH_ for every sample is negative in the temperature range between 50 and 275 K; furthermore, the magnitude of |_RH_| decreases with increasing \(x\) [Figs. 1(b) and 1(d)]. This behavior is in good agreement with the result of \(r\) measurements [Figs. 1(a) and 1(c)]; that is, \(r\) reduces with \(x\), indicating an increase in the charge-carrier density caused by F doping. In addition, for the samples with \(x\) < 18, |_RH_| of every sample increase monotonically as temperature lowers [Fig. 1(b)]. On the other hand, for the samples with \(x\) >= 0.18, |_RH_| of every sample exhibits a broad peak around 100 K [Figs. 1(b) and 1(d)]; that is, as the temperature lowers, |_RH_| increases down to about 100 K, and then decreases; in particular, for the samples with \(x\) = 0.24 and 0.3, both _RH_'s rise steeply and then become positive at temperatures below ~40 K.

Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the temperature dependences of \(r\) and _RH_ for three samples of Nd2CuO3,8F0.2 prepared from the same calcined power in different sintering runs. Although every sample exhibits a sharp superconducting transition at ~27 K, the _RH_-vs-_T_ curve seems extremely sensitive to the samples; that is, for sample Nos. 1 and 2, _RH_ is negative at all temperatures below 275 K; on the other hand, for sample No. 3, _RH_ becomes positive at the temperatures below 30 K. This result is similar to the case for the single-crystal samples of Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO4.10

The relationship between _RH_ and 1/_x_ is shown in Fig. 3. In this figure solid and open circles represent the data for _RH_ at 275 and 100 K, respectively. Each |_RH_| at 275

  and 100 K seems to increase monotonically with 1/_x_; this suggests that the number of mobile charge carriers increases monotonically with \(x\). this also indicates that charge carriers (holes or electrons) are doped into the Mott-Hubbard insulator as a result of F doping, as has been proposed [11] for La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) and Nd\({}_{2-y}\)Ce\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\).

Figure 4 shows the relationship between the normalized charge-carrier density (\(p_{H}\)) and \(x\). Here \(p_{H}\) is defined as

\[p_{H}=\frac{V}{|R_{H}|eN}\ ,\] (1)

where \(e\) is the elementary charge, \(V\) is the unit-cell volume, and \(N\) is the number of Cu ions per unit cell. Using the values of \(V\) = 0.189 26 nm3 and \(N\) = 2 for Nd2CuO4, [12] we can calculate the magnitude of \(p_{H}\). As \(x\) increases, each \(p_{H}\) of 275 and 100 K increases linearly up to around 0.18 and then much more rapidly for \(x\) > 0.18. If one doped F ion introduces one free electron into the sample, \(p_{H}\) should be equivalent to \(x\); at least in the range with \(x\) < 0.18 at 100 K, the experimental data are in good agreement with the relation \(p_{H}\) = \(x\). On the other hand, the change in the slope (_dp__H_/_dx_) at \(x\) ~ 0.18 may indicate the change in the electronic structure, implying the transition from an insulator to a metal around \(x\) = 0.18.

### Thermoelectric power

Figures 5(a)-5(c) show the temperature dependence of thermoelectric power (_S_) for the samples with 0 <= \(x\) <= 0.3. The value of \(S\) of every sample is found to be negative in the temperature range between 30 and 300 K; furthermore, |_S_| reduces with \(x\). Hence this indicates that the dominant charge carriers are assigned as electrons.

For the samples with \(x\) >= 0.1, |_S_| of every sample rises as the temperature lowers and then reduces steeply; that is, |_S_| exhibits a broad peak around 120 K for the sample with \(x\) = 0.1. It is worth noting that the temperature at which |_S_| exhibits a broad peak lowers with \(x\) [Fig.5(b)]. Even for the undoped sample, there may exist a broad peak around 220 K in the _S_-vs-_T_ curve [Fig. 5(a)]. For the samples with \(x\) >= 0.2, |_S_| of every sample seems to be nearly independent from \(x\) [Fig. 5(c)]. As the temperature lowers, |_S_| decreases linearly at temperatures above ~ 150 K, rises slightly in the temperature range between 150 and 60 K, and then reduces rapidly and changes sign. The temperature dependence of \(S\) will be discussed later.

The relationship between \(S\) and \(x\) is shown in Fig. 6(a); as \(x\) increases, each |_S_| at 275 and 100 K decreases steeply and then levels off to constant values above \(x\) = 0.2.

  According to the negative values of \(d\rho/dT\), \(R_{H}\), and \(S\), we assume that the normal states of the samples with \(x<0.2\) are of an \(n\)-type semiconductor; then \(S\) is expressed as

\[\begin{array}{l} S=-\,\frac{k_{B}}{e}\,\left[\,\ln\,\left[\,\frac{N_{0}(T)}{n_{e}}\,\right]+\frac{5}{2}+r\,\right]\,\,,\\ N_{0}(T)=2(2\pi m_{e}k_{B}T/h^{2})^{3/2}\,\,,\end{array}\] (2)

where \(k_{B}\) is the Boltzmann constant, \(n_{e}\) is the number density of electrons in the conduction band, \(m_{e}\) is the electron rest mass, and \(h\) is the Planck constant, respectively; the coefficient \(r\) is expected to be approximately constant. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 6(b), \(|S|\) seems to increase in proportion to \(\ln(1/x)\) in the range between \(1/  the density of states at \(E_{F}\) decreased with the shift in \(E_{F}\). In addition, the present \(R_{H}\) data for Nd2CuO4_-_x_F_x_(0.12<_x_<0.2) at 275 K seem to be in good agreement with the calculated \(R_{H}\)(J[_ab_, H]e) for Nd2-_y_C_y_CuO4 (in the superconducting and metallic region, such as 0.12<_y_<0.19).15 These suggest the existence of the transition from an electron-doped Mott-Hubbard insulator to a normal metal with increasing \(x\).

For the high-temperature limit of a Mott-Hubbard insulator with a strong electron-electron repulsion, the relationship between \(S\) and \(p_{H}\) is expressed as16

\[S(T\to\infty) = - \frac{k_{B}}{e}\ln\frac{2(1-p_{H})}{p_{H}}\]

. Assuming that \(p_{H}\) = \(x\) from the result of the \(R_{H}\) measurements, we can estimate _S_(_T_ - _  ) using Eq. (3). However, as shown in Fig. 7, the calculated _S_(_T_ - _  ) is about 10 times larger in magnitude than the measured _S_(275 K), although the \(x\) dependence of _S_(275 K) seems to be parallel to that of _S_(_T_ - _  ); this indicates the following possibilities: (a) \(p_{H}\) derived from \(R_{H}\) (\(p_{H}\) = \(x\) for the samples with \(x\) < 0.18) is not always equivalent to the number density of mobile carriers because of such effects as the grain boundaries and coexisting secondary phases which were not detected by XRD analysis, (b) the temperature (275 K) is not high enough for the high-temperature limit, or (c) the system is not a Mott-Hubbard insulator with a strong electron-electron repulsion.

### Thermoelectric power

Thermoelectric power (_S_) consists of three main processes:17,18 conduction-electron thermal diffusion (\(S_{d}\)); phonon drag, which implies that in their streaming motion the phonons can carry conduction electrons along (\(S_{f}\)); and finally magnon drag (\(S_{m}\)). As a first approximation, the contributions are treated as independent of each other and are added together:

\[S = S^{d} + S^{p} + S^{m}\]

. For metals with a spherical Fermi surface, \(S_{d}\) is expressed as the well-known Mott formula

\[S^{d} = \pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}T/(3eE_{F})\]

, where \(E_{F}\) is the Fermi energy. For free electrons, \(S_{d}\) is negative and increases linearly with \(T\) in absolute value. Indeed, for every sample with \(x\) > 0.2, an approximately linear relationship between \(S\) and \(T\) is observed at temperatures above 180 K [Fig. 5(c)]; thus, in the temperature range above 180 K, \(S_{d}\) is considered to be the predominant factor in Eq. (4).

For _n_-type semiconductors, \(S_{d}\) is rewritten using Eq. (2) and is equal to

\[S^{d} = - \frac{k_{B}}{e}\left[\frac{E_{C} - E_{F}}{k_{B}T} + \frac{5}{2} + r\right]\]

, in which \(E_{C}\) is the upper level of the conduction-band energy. Assuming that \(E_{C}\) - \(E_{F}\) is independent from \(T\), |_S__d_| increases with 1/_T_. Figures 8(a) and 8(b) show \(S\) as a function of 1/_T_ for the samples with \(x\) < 0.18; the linear 1/_T_ dependence of \(S\) is observed for each sample with \(x\) = 0, 0.1, 0.12, and 0.16 at temperatures above about 240, 170, 140, and 80 K, respectively; however, for the sample with \(x\) = 0.18, \(S\) is found not to be proportion

Figure 8: Relationship between thermoelectric power (_S_) and inverse temperature (1/_T_) for the Nd2CuO4-_x_F_x_ samples: (a) 0 ≤_x_ ≤0.12 and (b) 0.1 ≤_x_ ≤0.18.

Figure 7: Relationship between thermoelectric power (_S_) and fluorine content (_x_) for Nd2CuO4-_x_F_x_: The solid circles represent the measured data at 275 K; the dashed line represents the calculated dependence of \(S\) on \(x\) using Eq. (3) and the relation \(p_{H}\) = \(x\).

  al to 1/_T_. Consequently, the samples with \(x\) <= 0.16 are considered to be _n_-type semiconductors.

Now, we discuss why \(S\) exhibits a complicated temperature dependence. As already described, \(|S|\) has a broad peak in the _S_-_V_-_T_ curve (Figs. 5(a) and 5(b)); in addition, the temperature at which \(|S|\) shows a broad peak lowers with increasing \(x\). Theoretical investigations [19] indicate that a phonon- and magnon-drag peak should be observed in the range \(\Theta_{D}/10 - \Theta_{D}/5\) and \(T_{N}/10 - T_{N}/5\), respectively, where \(\Theta_{D}\) is the Debye temperature and \(T_{N}\) is the Neel temperature. Furthermore, for the rare-earth metals, \(S\) shows changes in slope at \(T_{C}\) and \(T_{N}\) in the _S_-vs-_T_ curve, [17] where \(T_{C}\) is the ferromagnetic Curie temperature.

The \(S_{P}\) term seems to be insignificant in Eq. (4) at temperatures above 30 K, because the magnitude of \(\Theta_{D}\) is generally not sensitive to the dopant concentration. Of course, at temperatures below 30 K, a phonon drag may contribute as a predominant term in Eq. (4); this is because \(|S|\) decreases steeply at temperatures below 30 K for every sample; specific-heat measurement [20] showed that the value of \(\Theta_{D}\) for single-crystal Nd2CuO4 was estimated to be ~319 K; hence the phonon-drag peak may be observed at around 30 K. On the other hand, neutron- and x-ray-diffraction analyses indicated [21] that there were no structural phase transitions in the temperature range between 320 and 4.2 K in Nd2CuO4 and Nd2-yCe,CuO4. Although a structural analysis of the F-doped samples at low temperatures has not been yet reported, all the F-doped samples are considered to belong to the Nd2CuO4-type tetragonal structure at temperatures below 310 K; thus the change in slope in the _S_-vs-_T_ curve is not due to the structural phase transition.

For Nd2CuO4, long-range antiferromagnetic ordering of the Cu moments was reported at \(T_{N1} \sim 250\) K by neutron-diffraction analyses. [22, 23] In addition, two more magnetic phase transitions associated with the Cu-moment reorientations were observed [19, 20] at \(T_{2} \sim 80\) K and \(T_{3} \sim 30\) K; furthermore, a sharp transition to long-range antiferromagnetic ordering of the Nd moments was observed at \(T_{N2} \sim 1.2\) K. [24] For Nd2-yCe,CuO4, as the Ce content (_y_) increased, \(T_{N1}\) lowered and then became undetectable at the temperatures above 4 K in the superconducting composition range by a muon-spin-rotation relaxation measurement. [25] Although the dependence of \(T_{2}\) and \(T_{3}\) on \(y\) have not been reported yet, \(T_{N2}\) was found to be nearly independent of \(y\). [24]

For Nd2CuO4-xFx, to our knowledge, magnetic ordering has not been yet investigated. Thus we assume that the relationship between \(T_{N1}\) (and \(T_{N2}\)) and \(x\) is similar to the case of Nd2-yCe,CuO4. Provided \(T_{N1}\) lowers with increasing \(x\), there is a possibility that a magnon drag is closely related to the change in slope in the _S_-vs-_T_ curve; indeed, for the nondoped sample, the temperature at which \(S\) exhibits a change in slope [ ~240 K, as shown in Figs. 5(a) and 8(a)] is approximately same as for \(T_{N1}( \sim 250\) K); also three other magnetic phases transitions (\(T_{2}\), \(T_{3}\), and \(T_{N2}\)) may be related to the temperature dependence of \(S\). Hence it is considered that \(S_{m}\) plays the significant role in Eq. (4) at temperatures below \(T_{N1}\) for the samples which are an _n_-type semiconductor (_x_ <= 0.16).

For the samples (_x_ >= 0.2) which are of a normal metal, the long-range antiferromagnetic ordering between Cu moments is unlikely to exist, similar to the case of Nd2-yCe,CuO4. [25] Thus the temperature dependence of \(S\) for each sample with \(x\) >= 0.2 is expected to be free from the effects of a magnon drag; however, as shown in Fig. 5(c), \(S\) of every sample exhibits changes in slope around 180 and 80 K. In order to explain these changes in \(S\), we must introduce another model, such as a multiband model [26] or a two-dimensional tight-binding model. [27] Also, there is a possibility that the phase separation occurs in the Nd2CuO4-xFx phase diagram, as has been proposed [28] for Nd2-yCe,CuO4 and La2-xSrCuO4. If the samples with \(x\) >= 0.2 consist of the multiple phases with various F content, the effects of \(S_{m}\) should not be ignored.

## V Summary

We reported both the Hall and thermoelectric-power coefficients measured using the same polycrystalline samples of superconducting Nd2CuO4-xFx (0.1 <= \(x\) <= 0.3). The Hall coefficient (\(R_{H}\)) was found to be negative at room temperature. The temperature dependence of \(R_{H}\) was similar to that of the polycrystalline _n_-type superconductor Nd2-yCe,CuO4. Furthermore, as \(x\) increased, the charge-carrier density (\(p_{H}\)) estimated from \(R_{H}\) at 100 K increased in proportion to \(x\) up to around 0.18 and then much more rapidly for \(x\) >= 0.18. On the other hand, the thermoelectric-power coefficient (_S_) was also found to be negative in the temperature range between 30 and 300 K. In addition, \(|S|\) decreased with increasing \(x\). The change in \(S\) due to F doping was discussed using the _n_-type semiconductor model for the samples with \(x\) < 0.18. In addition, the effect of a magnon drag was discussed in order to explain the temperature dependence of \(S\), especially for the samples with \(x\) < 0.18.
