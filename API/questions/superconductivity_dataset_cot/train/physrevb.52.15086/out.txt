###### Abstract

Magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, thermoelectric power, and Hall effect measurements have been made for _R_Ni2B2C, R = Y, Ho, La. The Y and Ho containing compounds are superconducting, with transition temperatures of 15 and 7.5 K, respectively. The La containing compound is nonsuperconducting down to 1.5 K. A distinct linear term is seen in the susceptibility of YNi2B2C, which is not seen in the nonsuperconducting LaNi2B2C. The two superconducting compounds have a linear resistivity at high temperatures, with a definite downward curvature below 300 K, while that of LaNi2B2C is linear up to 600 K (the limits of this study.) There seems to be an extra scattering process in the superconducting compounds which freezes out below 300 K. The thermopowers of the two superconducting compounds are identical, being small and negative, while that of LaNi2B2C is also negative, but is greater in magnitude. Analysis of the thermopower data reveals that LaNi2B2C has a factor of 2 larger electron diffusion term than the Y and Ho containing compounds, and that the latter values are nearly a factor of 10 smaller than expected from band theory. The Hall coefficient for all three materials is negative, small and shows some temperature dependence. At 300 K the carrier density for YNi2B2C is estimated to be 1.7 electrons per formula unit.

## Introduction

The recent discovery of the class of quaternary intermetallic borocarbide superconductors [1,2] has sparked a great deal of research, though as yet very little in the way of normal-state transport measurements. They have relatively high transition temperatures for intermetallic compounds [2], reaching 21 K for related thorium-palladium-based compounds [3,4] and 23 K for YPd5B3C0. [5] Although the materials have a layered-type structure [6,7] suggesting that they may share the strongly anisotropic properties of the cuprates, band structure calculations [8, 9, 10, 11] indicate that the electronic structure is much more three dimensional. Within this framework superconductivity in these materials can be described by a conventional phonon mechanism, with the relatively high transition temperatures due to a van Hove-like peak in the density of states at _epr._[8] Nickel substitution studies [12,13] provide some experimental evidence for this peak in the density of states, while specific heat measurements [14] and a substantial boron isotope effect [15] support the classification of these compounds as electron-phonon-mediated superconductors.

It has been shown that the transition temperature of the rare-earth borocarbides (_R_ = Lu, Y, Tm, Er, Ho, Dy, Tb) scales with the de Gennes factor [16](g-1)^{2}J(J+1). This implies that T_{c} of the Ho compound is reduced from 15 K (T_{c} of the nonmagnetic Y compound) to 7.5 K as a consequence of spin-flip scattering of the conduction electrons from the Ho^{3+} magnetic moments. The strong magnetic moment carried by the Ho^{3+} ions also results in an interesting competition between magnetism and superconductivity at low temperatures [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Although LaNi2B2C is nonmagnetic, the compound is not superconducting down to 1.5 K and will be referred to as nonsuperconducting. It has been suggested that this is due to the large size of the La^{3+} ion, resulting in a flattening of the NiB4 tetrahedra [23] and an increased Ni-Ni distance in the layered structure [24].

Normal-state measurements are often helpful in understanding the underlying mechanisms which result in superconductivity. The present study compares the magnetic susceptibility, thermoelectric power, resistivity, and Hall effect of LaNi2B2C, YNi2B2C, and HoNi2B2C, finding some properties which are common to all three of these materials and some common only to the two superconducting ones.

All three compounds used in this study were prepared from pure elements by a standard arc-melting and annealing procedure, described in Ref. 2, and checked to be phase pure by powder x-ray diffraction. All samples were polycrystalline.

## Results

dc magnetic susceptibility measurements were made on all three compounds using a commercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. A field of 50 000 G was used for the Y- and La-containing compounds. The Ho containing compound was measured in a field of 1000 G below 50 K and 2000 G above. Checks for linear magnetization with field were made for all samples at 20 and 300 K. The susceptibility measurements were repeated several times and, in the case of YNi2B2C, on two different samples. The normal-state susceptibility of HoNi2B2C is well fitted by a Curie law, with an effective moment of 10.4_m__b_ per cell. This is in good agreement with the moment of trivalent Ho ions. The normal-state magnetic susceptibility of YNi2B2C and LaNi2B2C is shown in Fig. 1. Both curves are best fitted by a constant term, a small Curie term, and a linear term. The Curie term varies slightly between samples, but the constant and linear terms are sample independent.

Figure 2 shows the thermopower for all three compounds to be negative and small. YNi_{2}B_{2}C and HoNi_{2}B_{2}C have a very similar thermopower, while that of LaNi_{2}B_{2}C is larger. For temperatures greater than 280 K in the case of LaNi_{2}B_{2}C and 230 K in the case of the superconducting materials, the data can be fitted by standard electron diffusion and phonon drag terms. This analysis reveals all three materials to have a similar phonon drag contribution (of between -450/T and -550/T \muV/K), while the electronic thermopower of LaNi_{2}B_{2}C [(-0.0134\pm0.0001)T \muV/K] is twice that of the superconducting Y- and Ho-containing compounds.

  and Van Vleck terms approximately cancel, then the constant term in the magnetic susceptibility of YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LaNi_{2}B_{2}C results from Pauli paramagnetism and the density of states at the Fermi surface, n(\varepsilon_{F}), can be estimated. This gives values of 6.4 states/eV cell for YNi_{2}B_{2}C and 3.0 states/eV cell for LaNi_{2}B_{2}C, comparing well with values of 3-7 states/eV cell from band structure calculations for YNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [8]) and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C. [9, 10, 11] The Curie term is small, slightly sample dependent, and is most likely to arise from magnetic impurities on the rare-earth site. In the case of YNi_{2}B_{2}C, this could be just 0.3% of Ni with a moment of 1.7 \mu_{B} (s =1/2) or even less of a magnetic rare earth (for example, 70 ppm of Ho^{3+}). The most striking feature of Fig. 1 is the linear term in the susceptibility. This term is very small for LaNi_{2}B_{2}C (-3.0\pm0.6\times10^{-9} emu/mol K), but is much larger for YNi_{2}B_{2}C (-1.05 \pm0.01\times10^{-7} emu/mol K). (The Curie term for HoNi_{2}B_{2}C is so large that this linear term would not be observable.) There is no obvious explanation for this linear term that appears strongly in the superconducting sample and only weakly in the nonsuperconducting material. It could possibly arise from a strongly energy- or temperature-dependent density of states or perhaps from magnetic (spin) fluctuations.

The low magnitude of the electron diffusion thermopower of the superconducting compounds indicates a slowly varying density of states at the Fermi surface. Band structure calculations show a sharp peak in n(\varepsilon_{F}), [8, 9, 10, 11] which, according to the standard electron diffusion formula

\[S=\frac{\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}T}{3e}\left(\frac{d~~\ln~~\sigma}{d\varepsilon }\right)_{e=e_{F}}\]

would result in a thermopower of 20-30 \muV/K, ignoring any energy dependence in the scattering lifetime. This is a factor of 10 greater than we observe for YNi_{2}B_{2}C or HoNi_{2}B_{2}C. The larger electron diffusion thermopower of LaNi_{2}B_{2}C indicates that the nonsuperconducting material has a more rapidly varying n(\varepsilon_{F}) than its superconducting analogs. The small electron diffusion thermopower of YNi_{2}B_{2}C and HoNi_{2}B_{2}C is perhaps a consequence of these materials sitting at the very top of the peak in the density of states predicted by band structure calculations, [8, 9, 10, 11] rather than just to one side. The larger electron thermopower of LaNi_{2}B_{2}C perhaps arises from \varepsilon_{F} being away from this peak, giving a small n(\varepsilon_{F}), but a larger energy dependence.

The resistivity data are particularly interesting. Previous measurements [2, 24, 26] missed the distinct curvature seen in the resistivity of the superconducting samples because the data were only taken to 300 K. Since this curvature does not continue to a higher temperature, but rather flattens off to a linear behavior above 300 K, it is unlikely to be due to the onset of a saturation in the resistivity (a consequence of the mean free path becoming comparable to the size of the unit cell) as is seen in the A15 intermetallic superconductors. [27] Such curvature away from a linear high-temperature behavior is also seen in the underdoped cuprates. [28, 29, 30] In the cuprates this behavior is associated with the opening of a pseudogap in the density of states [31, 32, 33] and a decrease in the spin susceptibility, which is not observed here. The results in Fig. 3 indicate that above 300 K the same scattering process may be responsible for d\rho/dT in all three compounds. However, for the superconducting ones there seems to be an extra T-independent scattering term which gradually freezes out below 300 K. Hence, above 300 K, the resistivity of HoNi_{2}B_{2}C and YNi_{2}B_{2}C is greater than that of LaNi_{2}B_{2}C, but is parallel to it. Below 300 K this unknown scattering process freezes out, giving rise to the deviation from linear behavior in the Y- and Ho-containing compounds. The resistivity of nonsuperconducting LaNi_{2}B_{2}C appears more like that of a regular metal, following a power law close to T^{5} at low temperatures, crossing over to a linear high-temperature behavior. This behavior is consistent with electron-phonon scattering dominating the resistivity of the nonsuperconducting compound. The superconducting samples require an additional, as yet unknown, scattering process to understand their resistivity behavior. Phonons in conjunction with a small energy scale, perhaps the van Hove-like peak in the density of states at \varepsilon_{F} , might produce this kind of behavior.

Using published lattice parameters, [7] we find that YNi_{2}B_{2}C has a Hall number of 3.4 carriers per unit cell at 300 K (1.7 carriers per formula unit). It may be coincidental that this value is in good agreement with results of muon spin resonance (\muSR) measurements, namely, 1.9 carriers per formula unit. [34] LaNi_{2}B_{2}C has a smaller Hall coefficient than the superconducting compounds, but in a metallic system this does not necessarily indicate a greater carrier density. [35] The Hall coefficient of YNi_{2}B_{2}C has a stronger temperature dependence than that of LaNi_{2}B_{2}C, possibly as a consequence of the additional scattering process described above. Approaching 300 K, the temperature dependence (dR_{H}/dT) of YNi_{2}B_{2}C is similar to that of LaNi_{2}B_{2}C although the magnitudes of R_{H} remain very different.

## Conclusions

The results presented in this paper for nonsuperconducting LaNi_{2}B_{2}C are entirely consistent with what is expected from electron-phonon scattering. However, there are some interesting differences in the normal-state properties of the superconducting and nonsuperconducting compounds. Associated with superconductivity, there is a linear term in the magnetic susceptibility and a distinct downward curvature from a linear high-temperature resistivity. These may indicate that the superconductivity in YNi_{2}B_{2}C and HoNi_{2}B_{2}C is caused by phonons in conjunction with a small energy scale (responsible for the unusual T dependence of the resistivity and susceptibility) or even a nonphonon mechanism.

They have relatively high transition temperatures for intermetallic compounds [2], reaching 21 K for related thorium-palladium-based compounds [3,4] and 23 K for YPd5B3C0. [5] Although the materials have a layered-type structure [6,7] suggesting that they may share the strongly anisotropic properties of the cuprates, band structure calculations [8, 9, 10, 11] indicate that the electronic structure is much more three dimensional. Within this framework superconductivity in these materials can be described by a conventional phonon mechanism, with the relatively high transition temperatures due to a van Hove-like peak in the density of states at _epr._[8] Nickel substitution studies [12,13] provide some experimental evidence for this peak in the density of states, while specific heat measurements [14] and a substantial boron isotope effect [15] support the classification of these compounds as electron-phonon-mediated superconductors.

It has been shown that the transition temperature of the rare-earth borocarbides (_R_ = Lu, Y, Tm, Er, Ho, Dy, Tb) scales with the de Gennes factor [16](g-1)^{2}J(J+1). This implies that T_{c} of the Ho compound is reduced from 15 K (T_{c} of the nonmagnetic Y compound) to 7.5 K as a consequence of spin-flip scattering of the conduction electrons from the Ho^{3+} magnetic moments. The strong magnetic moment carried by the Ho^{3+} ions also results in an interesting competition between magnetism and superconductivity at low temperatures [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Although LaNi2B2C is nonmagnetic, the compound is not superconducting down to 1.5 K and will be referred to as nonsuperconducting. It has been suggested that this is due to the large size of the La^{3+} ion, resulting in a flattening of the NiB4 tetrahedra [23] and an increased Ni-Ni distance in the layered structure [24].

Normal-state measurements are often helpful in understanding the underlying mechanisms which result in superconductivity. The present study compares the magnetic susceptibility, thermoelectric power, resistivity, and Hall effect of LaNi2B2C, YNi2B2C, and HoNi2B2C, finding some properties which are common to all three of these materials and some common only to the two superconducting ones.

All three compounds used in this study were prepared from pure elements by a standard arc-melting and annealing procedure, described in Ref. 2, and checked to be phase pure by powder x-ray diffraction. All samples were polycrystalline.

## Results

dc magnetic susceptibility measurements were made on all three compounds using a commercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. A field of 50 000 G was used for the Y- and La-containing compounds. The Ho containing compound was measured in a field of 1000 G below 50 K and 2000 G above. Checks for linear magnetization with field were made for all samples at 20 and 300 K. The susceptibility measurements were repeated several times and, in the case of YNi2B2C, on two different samples. The normal-state susceptibility of HoNi2B2C is well fitted by a Curie law, with an effective moment of 10.4_m__b_ per cell. This is in good agreement with the moment of trivalent Ho ions. The normal-state magnetic susceptibility of YNi2B2C and LaNi2B2C is shown in Fig. 1. Both curves are best fitted by a constant term, a small Curie term, and a linear term. The Curie term varies slightly between samples, but the constant and linear terms are sample independent.

Figure 2 shows the thermopower for all three compounds to be negative and small. YNi_{2}B_{2}C and HoNi_{2}B_{2}C have a very similar thermopower, while that of LaNi_{2}B_{2}C is larger. For temperatures greater than 280 K in the case of LaNi_{2}B_{2}C and 230 K in the case of the superconducting materials, the data can be fitted by standard electron diffusion and phonon drag terms. This analysis reveals all three materials to have a similar phonon drag contribution (of between -450/T and -550/T \muV/K), while the electronic thermopower of LaNi_{2}B_{2}C [(-0.0134\pm0.0001)T \muV/K] is twice that of the superconducting Y- and Ho-containing compounds.

  and Van Vleck terms approximately cancel, then the constant term in the magnetic susceptibility of YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LaNi_{2}B_{2}C results from Pauli paramagnetism and the density of states at the Fermi surface, n(\varepsilon_{F}), can be estimated. This gives values of 6.4 states/eV cell for YNi_{2}B_{2}C and 3.0 states/eV cell for LaNi_{2}B_{2}C, comparing well with values of 3-7 states/eV cell from band structure calculations for YNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [8]) and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C. [9, 10, 11] The Curie term is small, slightly sample dependent, and is most likely to arise from magnetic impurities on the rare-earth site. In the case of YNi_{2}B_{2}C, this could be just 0.3% of Ni with a moment of 1.7 \mu_{B} (s =1/2) or even less of a magnetic rare earth (for example, 70 ppm of Ho^{3+}). The most striking feature of Fig. 1 is the linear term in the susceptibility. This term is very small for LaNi_{2}B_{2}C (-3.0\pm0.6\times10^{-9} emu/mol K), but is much larger for YNi_{2}B_{2}C (-1.05 \pm0.01\times10^{-7} emu/mol K). (The Curie term for HoNi_{2}B_{2}C is so large that this linear term would not be observable.) There is no obvious explanation for this linear term that appears strongly in the superconducting sample and only weakly in the nonsuperconducting material. It could possibly arise from a strongly energy- or temperature-dependent density of states or perhaps from magnetic (spin) fluctuations.

The low magnitude of the electron diffusion thermopower of the superconducting compounds indicates a slowly varying density of states at the Fermi surface. Band structure calculations show a sharp peak in n(\varepsilon_{F}), [8, 9, 10, 11] which, according to the standard electron diffusion formula

\[S=\frac{\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}T}{3e}\left(\frac{d~~\ln~~\sigma}{d\varepsilon }\right)_{e=e_{F}}\]

would result in a thermopower of 20-30 \muV/K, ignoring any energy dependence in the scattering lifetime. This is a factor of 10 greater than we observe for YNi_{2}B_{2}C or HoNi_{2}B_{2}C. The larger electron diffusion thermopower of LaNi_{2}B_{2}C indicates that the nonsuperconducting material has a more rapidly varying n(\varepsilon_{F}) than its superconducting analogs. The small electron diffusion thermopower of YNi_{2}B_{2}C and HoNi_{2}B_{2}C is perhaps a consequence of these materials sitting at the very top of the peak in the density of states predicted by band structure calculations, [8, 9, 10, 11] rather than just to one side. The larger electron thermopower of LaNi_{2}B_{2}C perhaps arises from \varepsilon_{F} being away from this peak, giving a small n(\varepsilon_{F}), but a larger energy dependence.

The resistivity data are particularly interesting. Previous measurements [2, 24, 26] missed the distinct curvature seen in the resistivity of the superconducting samples because the data were only taken to 300 K. Since this curvature does not continue to a higher temperature, but rather flattens off to a linear behavior above 300 K, it is unlikely to be due to the onset of a saturation in the resistivity (a consequence of the mean free path becoming comparable to the size of the unit cell) as is seen in the A15 intermetallic superconductors. [27] Such curvature away from a linear high-temperature behavior is also seen in the underdoped cuprates. [28, 29, 30] In the cuprates this behavior is associated with the opening of a pseudogap in the density of states [31, 32, 33] and a decrease in the spin susceptibility, which is not observed here. The results in Fig. 3 indicate that above 300 K the same scattering process may be responsible for d\rho/dT in all three compounds. However, for the superconducting ones there seems to be an extra T-independent scattering term which gradually freezes out below 300 K. Hence, above 300 K, the resistivity of HoNi_{2}B_{2}C and YNi_{2}B_{2}C is greater than that of LaNi_{2}B_{2}C, but is parallel to it. Below 300 K this unknown scattering process freezes out, giving rise to the deviation from linear behavior in the Y- and Ho-containing compounds. The resistivity of nonsuperconducting LaNi_{2}B_{2}C appears more like that of a regular metal, following a power law close to T^{5} at low temperatures, crossing over to a linear high-temperature behavior. This behavior is consistent with electron-phonon scattering dominating the resistivity of the nonsuperconducting compound. The superconducting samples require an additional, as yet unknown, scattering process to understand their resistivity behavior. Phonons in conjunction with a small energy scale, perhaps the van Hove-like peak in the density of states at \varepsilon_{F} , might produce this kind of behavior.

It may be coincidental that this value is in good agreement with results of muon spin resonance (\muSR) measurements, namely, 1.9 carriers per formula unit. [34] LaNi_{2}B_{2}C has a smaller Hall coefficient than the superconducting compounds, but in a metallic system this does not necessarily indicate a greater carrier density. [35] The Hall coefficient of YNi_{2}B_{2}C has a stronger temperature dependence than that of LaNi_{2}B_{2}C, possibly as a consequence of the additional scattering process described above. Approaching 300 K, the temperature dependence (dR_{H}/dT) of YNi_{2}B_{2}C is similar to that of LaNi_{2}B_{2}C although the magnitudes of R_{H} remain very different.

## Conclusions

The results presented in this paper for nonsuperconducting LaNi_{2}B_{2}C are entirely consistent with what is expected from electron-phonon scattering. However, there are some interesting differences in the normal-state properties of the superconducting and nonsuperconducting compounds. Associated with superconductivity, there is a linear term in the magnetic susceptibility and a distinct downward curvature from a linear high-temperature resistivity. These may indicate that the superconductivity in YNi_{2}B_{2}C and HoNi_{2}B_{2}C is caused by phonons in conjunction with a small energy scale (responsible for the unusual T dependence of the resistivity and susceptibility) or even a nonphonon mechanism.
