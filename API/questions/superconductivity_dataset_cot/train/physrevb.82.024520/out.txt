###### Abstract

We have searched for time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields in the noncentrosymmetric superconductor Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} via muon spin relaxation (\muSR) in zero applied field. We also measured the temperature dependence of the superfluid density by muon spin rotation in transverse field to investigate the superconducting pairing symmetry in two polycrystalline samples of significantly different purities. In the high-purity sample, we detected no time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields greater than 0.05 G. The superfluid density was also found to be exponentially flat as T\rightarrow 0 and so can be fit to a single-gap BCS model. In contrast, the lower purity sample showed an increase in the zero-field \muSR relaxation rate below T_{c} corresponding to a characteristic field strength of 0.6 G. While the temperature dependence of the superfluid density was also found to be consistent with a single-gap BCS model, the magnitude as T\rightarrow 0 was found to be much lower for a given applied field than in the case of the high-purity sample. These findings suggest that Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} is a superconductor characterized by a single-gap function with no nodes and sample quality drastically affects the superconducting properties of this system.

2010 10.1103/PhysRevB.82.024520 2010 14 January 2010; revised manuscript received 4 July 2010; published 26 July 2010 2010 10.1103/PhysRevB.82.024520 2010 10.1103/PhysRevB.82.024520 2010 10.1103/PhysRevB.82.024520 2010 10.1103/PhysRevB.82.024520 2010 2010 201520 201  strong in this material and so questions about the superconducting pairing symmetry are of significant interest.

The superconducting pairing symmetry of Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} has already been investigated through both heat capacity [16, 17] and photoemission spectroscopy, [18, 19] and the data is consistent with isotropic s-wave pairing in both cases. However, point-contact spectroscopy [16] and penetration depth measurements performed using a tunnel diode oscillator [20] suggest that the system is better described by two-gap superconductivity. The two-gap model is consistent with spin-split bands that are a direct consequence of the lack of inversion symmetry combined with significant SOC, and is expected in the case of a mixed pairing state with a significant spin-triplet component. To help resolve the apparent disagreement regarding the nature of the superconducting pairing symmetry in Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16}, more experiments need to be performed.

Muon spin rotation is a powerful technique for measuring the penetration depth and determining the nature of the pairing symmetry in superconductors. Due to maximal parity violation in the weak interaction decay of pions, the muons produced for such an experiment are initially \sim100% spin polarized. Muon spin rotation employs a transverse-field geometry, as the muons are implanted into the sample one at a time with the initial polarization oriented perpendicular to the applied magnetic field. The muon spins exhibit Larmor precession about the local magnetic field and then decay into a positron, plus two neutrinos which are not detected. The resulting positron travels preferentially in the direction of the muon spin at the time of decay, and so due to the asymmetric nature of this decay one can track the polarization of the muon ensemble as a function of time by setting up positron counters around the sample. In type-II superconductors, the mixed (or vortex) state gives rise to a spatial distribution of local magnetic fields; this field distribution manifests itself in the \muSR signal through a relaxation of the muon polarization. \muSR has been used successfully for some time to study the mixed state in superconductors; further details can be found in Refs. [21] and [22].

Zero-field (ZF) \muSR is very complementary to transverse field (TF) \muSR superconductor studies. The experimental setup is essentially the same but no field is applied. \muSR is an extremely sensitive probe of magnetism (internal fields on the order of 0.1 G can be readily detected), and so when investigating superconductors a ZF-\muSR experiment is generally performed in advance of TF-\muSR measurements to search for any anomalous magnetism that was not previously detected by other techniques. This knowledge is quite important since the presence of magnetism in a superconductor can significantly complicate penetration depth measurements.

ZF-\muSR is also useful to search for time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields; the presence of such fields limits the possible superconducting states and the associated pairing symmetry. For example, time-reversal symmetry is a prerequisite for any spin-singlet state, but this symmetry is broken for certain spin-triplet states, specifically for those which have a degenerate representation. The presence of two or more degenerate superconducting phases naturally leads to a spatially inhomogeneous order parameter near the resulting domain walls; this creates spontaneous supercurrents and hence magnetic fields near those regions. Another possible origin of time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields is from intrinsic magnetic moments due to spin polarization (for spin-triplet pairing) and the relative angular momentum of the Cooper pairs. [23] Broken time-reversal symmetry was previously detected in the unconventional superconductor Sr_{2}RuO_{4} via \muSR, [24] as a local field of \sim0.5 G was found below T_{c} at the muon site. This provided some of the strongest evidence that Sr_{2}RuO_{4} is actually a p-wave superconductor. Similar time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields could be detected by \muSR if the spin-triplet contribution to the superconducting state in Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} is significant.

In this work, we have used both ZF and TF-\muSR to investigate the nature of the superconductivity in two polycrystalline Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} samples of different quality. The former allowed us to search for time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields, and the latter allowed us to measure the penetration depth and characterize the pairing symmetry. Our data is consistent with single-gap, nodeless superconductivity; this is in agreement with the earlier heat capacity [17] and photoemission spectroscopy work. [18, 19]

Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} samples were synthesized by a standard solid-state reaction of pure Mg, Ir, and B elements as described elsewhere, [10] and the chemical composition was accurately determined via electron diffraction. Prior to the \muSR measurements, the samples were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction, performed on a Scintag XDS 2000 diffractometer with Cu K\alpha radiation (\lambda = 0.15460 nm). Rietveld refinements of the structures were achieved using gSAS, [25, 26] and slightly different lattice constants of 10.5629(4) A and 10.5655(1) A were found for sample 1 and 2, respectively. This is likely due to more vacancies in the crystal structure of the former, and when one also considers that many more impurity peaks are observed in the corresponding x-ray pattern (shown in Fig. 1), this suggests that sample 2 is a much higher quality specimen with fewer impurities/defects. The magnetic susceptibility of each sample was also measured with a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer; the ZF-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) measurements, shown in Fig. 2, confirmed nice superconducting properties. If we let T_{c} correspond to the onset of the suscep

  tibility drop, then T_{c}\sim 4.8 K for sample 1 and 4.6 K for sample 2. The much sharper drop below T_{c}, observed in both the FC and ZFC measurements of sample 2, provides further evidence for the better sample quality in this case.

ZF-\muSR data was collected using the dilution refrigerator in conjunction with the M15 surface muon beamline at TRIUMF. Figure 3 depicts normalized asymmetry vs time plots for both samples measured at temperatures of 0.1 and 6 K. This data was best fit to the form,

\[A(t)=A_{0}e^{-\lambda t}G_{KT}(t),\] (1)

where G_{KT}(t) is the Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe relaxation function given by

\[G_{KT}(t)=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{3}(1-\Delta^{2}t^{2})e^{-1/2\Delta^{2}t^{2}}.\] (2)

The Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe relaxation is due to nuclear dipolar fields and is temperature independent; we determined this to be \Delta = 0.207(4) \mus^{-1} from a global fit incorporating all of our ZF data for the two samples. The exponential relaxation rate was set as a variable parameter and this is plotted as a function of temperature for the two samples in Fig. 4.

Sample 1 shows a small increase in the exponential relaxation rate of \sim0.05 \mus^{-1} below T_{c}, corresponding to a characteristic field strength of B\sim 0.6 G. However, the exponential relaxation rate of sample 2 remains essentially constant below T_{c}. Although we cannot completely rule out the presence of time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields in sample 2, the current data does set an upper bound on the magnitude of these fields to be \sim0.05 G.

There are a few different scenarios that can explain the discrepancy between the ZF data of the two samples. One possibility is that the relaxation increase in sample 1 is actually due to time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields. The presence of such fields suggests that the associated superconducting state is at least twofold degenerate and the spatially varying order parameter would then lead to the presence of supercurrents in the bulk of the superconductor.[23] If this is the case, one would generally expect these fields to exist in sample 2 also, although we note that the domain size may be substantially smaller in sample 1 due to the poorer quality. Many more muons would then stop near the domain walls in sample 1 and see a nonzero local field associated with the currents flowing at the domain boundaries; this could lead to the increased broadening below T_{c} for this case only. Furthermore, NMR and electron-diffraction measurements were performed very recently on two similar samples with compositions Mg_{9.3}Ir_{19}B_{16.7} and Mg_{10.5}Ir_{19}B_{17.1}.[27] The electron-diffraction measurements clearly confirmed that the former was a better quality sample with fewer defects/impurities and the NMR measurements indicated that only the other sample had a finite spin susceptibility in the zero-temperature limit. These results then suggested that defects/impurities may enhance spin-orbit coupling in this system thus leading to an increased spin-triplet component of the superconductivity; this interpretation is also consistent with the observation of time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields in our lower quality sample only.

There are also other possible explanations for the difference between the ZF data of the two samples not related to time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields. For example, the increased ZF relaxation in sample 1 could be due to dilute magnetic impurities throughout the sample. However, this seems rather unlikely since the onset of the increased relax

Figure 4: (Color online) ZF-\muSR relaxation rate vs temperature. The relaxation rate of sample 1 shows a small increase around T_{c} while the relaxation rate of sample 2 remains essentially constant within the error bars. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are outlined in the text.

Figure 3: (Color online) Normalized asymmetry vs time for the ZF-\muSR measurements conducted on both samples at temperatures of 0.1 and 6 K. The fits, as described in the text, are superimposed on the data using solid black lines. A pronounced change is observed in the relaxation rate of sample 1 below T_{c}, but only a very small change is observed for sample 2.

  ation rate occurs very close to T_{c} and furthermore, these are not expected in this system. The other possibility is related to field zeroing. If the applied field was not perfectly zeroed in our experiment, there could potentially be some trapped flux in the superconducting state of these samples. Sample 1 may be more efficient at trapping flux than sample 2 due to the lower quality of the former and this could result in an increased relaxation below T_{c} for sample 1 only. We note that the ZF measurements were conducted on both samples back-to-back without ever applying a field during this time, and so any residual applied field should be the same for both samples.

While it is not possible for us to distinguish between these different scenarios, we can conclude with certainty that a high-purity sample of Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} showed no evidence for time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields greater than 0.05 G. We also observed only very weak ZF relaxation in both samples at all temperatures, and so this allows for reliable penetration depth measurements to be performed.

With this in mind we proceeded to collect TF-\muSR data, as measuring the penetration depth would allow us to learn more about the nature of the superconducting pairing symmetry. Note that all of the data was collected via field cooling. Figure 5 shows the fast-Fourier transforms obtained at both 6 and 0.1 K. Below T_{c}, the characteristic line shape of an Abrikosov vortex lattice was not resolved as a large background signal from the silver sample holder was superimposed on the data. However, we did find significant line broadening below T_{c} as expected for a superconductor (see Fig. 5). This broadening was analyzed as a Gaussian field distribution; the width of this distribution \sigma_{sc} has been shown previously to be proportional to the superfluid density \sigma_{sc}\propton_{s}/m^{*}\propto1/\lambda^{2},[28]\sigma_{sc} was first obtained by fitting the \muSR data in the time domain to the functional form,

\[A(t)=A_{0}e^{-\sigma^{2}t^{2}/2}\cos(\omega t+\phi)+A_{bg}\cos(\omega_{bg}t+ \phi)\,.\] (3)

The nonrelaxing background term was included to account for the muons stopping in the silver sample holder. The first term gives the total sample relaxation rate \sigma; there are contributions from both the vortex lattice and nuclear dipole moments below T_{c}. The contribution from the vortex lattice, \sigma_{sc}, was determined by quadratically subtracting the background nuclear dipolar relaxation rate obtained from spectra measured above T_{c}.

Figure 6 depicts the TF muon spin relaxation rate (proportional to superfluid density) vs temperature for our two Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} samples. Sample 1 was investigated with both TF=500 G and 3 kG while sample 2 was investigated only in 500 G. The sample 1 data indicates that the superfluid density decreases with increasing applied field as expected. The superfluid density of the two samples at 500 G as T\rightarrow 0 is noticeably different; sample 2 has a higher superfluid density than sample 1 and this is consistent with the higher quality of the former. However, the temperature dependence of the superfluid density is the same for both samples: namely, the superfluid density seems to saturate as T\rightarrow 0. Since conventional BCS theory predicts an exponentially flat temperature dependence of the superfluid density at low temperatures, we proceeded to fit our data to this model. The agreement is quite good for both samples as seen in Fig. 6, and so this suggests that this material is characterized by a superconducting gap function with no nodes. For TF =500 G, fitting to the single-gap BCS model gave us the following parameters: 2\Delta/kT_{c}=4.74(9) (2\Delta=1.6 meV), T_{c} =3.8(1) K, and \lambda(T\rightarrow 0)\,=3570(20) A for sample 1 and 2\Delta/kT_{c}=4.93(5) (2\Delta=1.6 meV), T_{c}=3.7(1) K and \lambda(T\rightarrow 0)\,=3230(20) A for sample 2. Note that our 2\Delta/kT_{c} values are only slightly larger than what one expects for weak-coupled BCS theory and that the penetration depth values were obtained from \sigma_{sc} through a conversion procedure outlined in Ref. 29. The significantly suppressed T_{c}'s in only a modest applied field of 500 G are consistent with the relatively low H_{c2}\sim 8 kG (Ref. 16) of this system.

Motivated by the earlier work proposing multigap superconductivity in Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16},[16, 20] we also tried to fit our data to a phenomenological two-gap model as described

Figure 5: Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} sample 1 normalized asymmetry vs time and the corresponding fast-Fourier transforms at TF=500 G for both 6 K [shown in (a) and (b)] and 0.1 K [shown in (c) and (d)]. While the increased broadening is apparent for T= 0.1 K, the characteristic Abrikosov time shape was not observed. This is likely due to the large background signal superimposed on the data.

Figure 6: (Color online) TF-\muSR superconducting relaxation rate \sigma_{sc} vs temperature. The data can be adequately fit to a single-gap BCS model, as indicated by the solid lines.

  elsewhere.[30] Since the fitting routine assigned a weighting of 0 (within our error bars) to one of the gaps, we found that a two-gap model does not seem to describe our data unless the two gaps are very similar in magnitude. However, we note that previous measurements of Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} suggesting multigap superconductivity were essentially performed in ZF while our \muSR measurements were performed in an applied field. While a recent \muSR penetration depth measurement performed by our group on the superconductor Ba(Fe_{0.926}Co_{0.074})_{2}As_{2} found evidence for multigap superconductivity in that material, the same measurements also revealed that the relative weighting factor of the smaller gap quickly approaches 0 with increasing TF.[30] This could also be applicable to the present case.

Although the above results come with the warning that previous \muSR measurements on polycrystalline cuprate samples have resulted in the correct temperature dependence of the superfluid density being masked, this may be less of a concern in the present case due to the cubic crystal symmetry and hence the isotropic penetration depth. In any event, future penetration depth measurements should be conducted on single crystals when they become available to confirm our results.

In conclusion, we have used both ZF and TF-\muSR to investigate the superconductivity in two samples of the non-centrosymmetric system Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16}. In the higher quality sample, ZF-\muSR measurements find no evidence for time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields larger than 0.05 G. TF-\muSR measurements of both samples yield a superfluid density that is exponentially flat at low temperatures, and so our data can be fit to a single-gap BCS model. These findings suggest that Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} is a superconductor characterized by a single-gap function with no nodes. Our work also suggests that the superconducting properties of this system are very sensitive to sample quality and so further studies are required to investigate the roles of both SOC and defects/ impurities on the superconductivity of this material in more detail.

###### Abstract

We have searched for time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields in the noncentrosymmetric superconductor Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} via muon spin relaxation (\muSR) in zero applied field. We also measured the temperature dependence of the superfluid density by muon spin rotation in transverse field to investigate the superconducting pairing symmetry in two polycrystalline samples of significantly different purities. In the high-purity sample, we detected no time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields greater than 0.05 G. The superfluid density was also found to be exponentially flat as T\rightarrow 0 and so can be fit to a single-gap BCS model. In contrast, the lower purity sample showed an increase in the zero-field \muSR relaxation rate below T_{c} corresponding to a characteristic field strength of 0.6 G. While the temperature dependence of the superfluid density was also found to be consistent with a single-gap BCS model, the magnitude as T\rightarrow 0 was found to be much lower for a given applied field than in the case of the high-purity sample. These findings suggest that Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} is a superconductor characterized by a single-gap function with no nodes and sample quality drastically affects the superconducting properties of this system.

The superconducting pairing symmetry of Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} has already been investigated through both heat capacity [16, 17] and photoemission spectroscopy, [18, 19] and the data is consistent with isotropic s-wave pairing in both cases. However, point-contact spectroscopy [16] and penetration depth measurements performed using a tunnel diode oscillator [20] suggest that the system is better described by two-gap superconductivity. The two-gap model is consistent with spin-split bands that are a direct consequence of the lack of inversion symmetry combined with significant SOC, and is expected in the case of a mixed pairing state with a significant spin-triplet component. To help resolve the apparent disagreement regarding the nature of the superconducting pairing symmetry in Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16}, more experiments need to be performed.

Muon spin rotation is a powerful technique for measuring the penetration depth and determining the nature of the pairing symmetry in superconductors. Due to maximal parity violation in the weak interaction decay of pions, the muons produced for such an experiment are initially \sim100% spin polarized. Muon spin rotation employs a transverse-field geometry, as the muons are implanted into the sample one at a time with the initial polarization oriented perpendicular to the applied magnetic field. The muon spins exhibit Larmor precession about the local magnetic field and then decay into a positron, plus two neutrinos which are not detected. The resulting positron travels preferentially in the direction of the muon spin at the time of decay, and so due to the asymmetric nature of this decay one can track the polarization of the muon ensemble as a function of time by setting up positron counters around the sample. In type-II superconductors, the mixed (or vortex) state gives rise to a spatial distribution of local magnetic fields; this field distribution manifests itself in the \muSR signal through a relaxation of the muon polarization. \muSR has been used successfully for some time to study the mixed state in superconductors; further details can be found in Refs. [21] and [22].

Zero-field (ZF) \muSR is very complementary to transverse field (TF) \muSR superconductor studies. The experimental setup is essentially the same but no field is applied. \muSR is an extremely sensitive probe of magnetism (internal fields on the order of 0.1 G can be readily detected), and so when investigating superconductors a ZF-\muSR experiment is generally performed in advance of TF-\muSR measurements to search for any anomalous magnetism that was not previously detected by other techniques. This knowledge is quite important since the presence of magnetism in a superconductor can significantly complicate penetration depth measurements.

ZF-\muSR is also useful to search for time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields; the presence of such fields limits the possible superconducting states and the associated pairing symmetry. For example, time-reversal symmetry is a prerequisite for any spin-singlet state, but this symmetry is broken for certain spin-triplet states, specifically for those which have a degenerate representation. The presence of two or more degenerate superconducting phases naturally leads to a spatially inhomogeneous order parameter near the resulting domain walls; this creates spontaneous supercurrents and hence magnetic fields near those regions. Another possible origin of time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields is from intrinsic magnetic moments due to spin polarization (for spin-triplet pairing) and the relative angular momentum of the Cooper pairs. [23] Broken time-reversal symmetry was previously detected in the unconventional superconductor Sr_{2}RuO_{4} via \muSR, [24] as a local field of \sim0.5 G was found below T_{c} at the muon site. This provided some of the strongest evidence that Sr_{2}RuO_{4} is actually a p-wave superconductor. Similar time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields could be detected by \muSR if the spin-triplet contribution to the superconducting state in Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} is significant.

In this work, we have used both ZF and TF-\muSR to investigate the nature of the superconductivity in two polycrystalline Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} samples of different quality. The former allowed us to search for time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields, and the latter allowed us to measure the penetration depth and characterize the pairing symmetry. Our data is consistent with single-gap, nodeless superconductivity; this is in agreement with the earlier heat capacity [17] and photoemission spectroscopy work. [18, 19]

Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} samples were synthesized by a standard solid-state reaction of pure Mg, Ir, and B elements as described elsewhere, [10] and the chemical composition was accurately determined via electron diffraction. Prior to the \muSR measurements, the samples were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction, performed on a Scintag XDS 2000 diffractometer with Cu K\alpha radiation (\lambda = 0.15460 nm). Rietveld refinements of the structures were achieved using gSAS, [25, 26] and slightly different lattice constants of 10.5629(4) A and 10.5655(1) A were found for sample 1 and 2, respectively. This is likely due to more vacancies in the crystal structure of the former, and when one also considers that many more impurity peaks are observed in the corresponding x-ray pattern (shown in Fig. 1), this suggests that sample 2 is a much higher quality specimen with fewer impurities/defects. The magnetic susceptibility of each sample was also measured with a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer; the ZF-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) measurements, shown in Fig. 2, confirmed nice superconducting properties. If we let T_{c} correspond to the onset of the suscep

  tibility drop, then T_{c}\sim 4.8 K for sample 1 and 4.6 K for sample 2. The much sharper drop below T_{c}, observed in both the FC and ZFC measurements of sample 2, provides further evidence for the better sample quality in this case.

ZF-\muSR data was collected using the dilution refrigerator in conjunction with the M15 surface muon beamline at TRIUMF. Figure 3 depicts normalized asymmetry vs time plots for both samples measured at temperatures of 0.1 and 6 K. This data was best fit to the form,

\[A(t)=A_{0}e^{-\lambda t}G_{KT}(t),\] (1)

where G_{KT}(t) is the Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe relaxation function given by

\[G_{KT}(t)=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{3}(1-\Delta^{2}t^{2})e^{-1/2\Delta^{2}t^{2}}.\] (2)

The Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe relaxation is due to nuclear dipolar fields and is temperature independent; we determined this to be \Delta = 0.207(4) \mus^{-1} from a global fit incorporating all of our ZF data for the two samples. The exponential relaxation rate was set as a variable parameter and this is plotted as a function of temperature for the two samples in Fig. 4.

Sample 1 shows a small increase in the exponential relaxation rate of \sim0.05 \mus^{-1} below T_{c}, corresponding to a characteristic field strength of B\sim 0.6 G. However, the exponential relaxation rate of sample 2 remains essentially constant below T_{c}. Although we cannot completely rule out the presence of time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields in sample 2, the current data does set an upper bound on the magnitude of these fields to be \sim0.05 G.

There are a few different scenarios that can explain the discrepancy between the ZF data of the two samples. One possibility is that the relaxation increase in sample 1 is actually due to time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields. The presence of such fields suggests that the associated superconducting state is at least twofold degenerate and the spatially varying order parameter would then lead to the presence of supercurrents in the bulk of the superconductor.[23] If this is the case, one would generally expect these fields to exist in sample 2 also, although we note that the domain size may be substantially smaller in sample 1 due to the poorer quality. Many more muons would then stop near the domain walls in sample 1 and see a nonzero local field associated with the currents flowing at the domain boundaries; this could lead to the increased broadening below T_{c} for this case only. Furthermore, NMR and electron-diffraction measurements were performed very recently on two similar samples with compositions Mg_{9.3}Ir_{19}B_{16.7} and Mg_{10.5}Ir_{19}B_{17.1}.[27] The electron-diffraction measurements clearly confirmed that the former was a better quality sample with fewer defects/impurities and the NMR measurements indicated that only the other sample had a finite spin susceptibility in the zero-temperature limit. These results then suggested that defects/impurities may enhance spin-orbit coupling in this system thus leading to an increased spin-triplet component of the superconductivity; this interpretation is also consistent with the observation of time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields in our lower quality sample only.

There are also other possible explanations for the difference between the ZF data of the two samples not related to time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields. For example, the increased ZF relaxation in sample 1 could be due to dilute magnetic impurities throughout the sample. However, this seems rather unlikely since the onset of the increased relax

Figure 4: (Color online) ZF-\muSR relaxation rate vs temperature. The relaxation rate of sample 1 shows a small increase around T_{c} while the relaxation rate of sample 2 remains essentially constant within the error bars. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are outlined in the text.

Figure 3: (Color online) Normalized asymmetry vs time for the ZF-\muSR measurements conducted on both samples at temperatures of 0.1 and 6 K. The fits, as described in the text, are superimposed on the data using solid black lines. A pronounced change is observed in the relaxation rate of sample 1 below T_{c}, but only a very small change is observed for sample 2.

  ation rate occurs very close to T_{c} and furthermore, these are not expected in this system. The other possibility is related to field zeroing. If the applied field was not perfectly zeroed in our experiment, there could potentially be some trapped flux in the superconducting state of these samples. Sample 1 may be more efficient at trapping flux than sample 2 due to the lower quality of the former and this could result in an increased relaxation below T_{c} for sample 1 only. We note that the ZF measurements were conducted on both samples back-to-back without ever applying a field during this time, and so any residual applied field should be the same for both samples.

While it is not possible for us to distinguish between these different scenarios, we can conclude with certainty that a high-purity sample of Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} showed no evidence for time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields greater than 0.05 G. We also observed only very weak ZF relaxation in both samples at all temperatures, and so this allows for reliable penetration depth measurements to be performed.

With this in mind we proceeded to collect TF-\muSR data, as measuring the penetration depth would allow us to learn more about the nature of the superconducting pairing symmetry. Note that all of the data was collected via field cooling. Figure 5 shows the fast-Fourier transforms obtained at both 6 and 0.1 K. Below T_{c}, the characteristic line shape of an Abrikosov vortex lattice was not resolved as a large background signal from the silver sample holder was superimposed on the data. However, we did find significant line broadening below T_{c} as expected for a superconductor (see Fig. 5). This broadening was analyzed as a Gaussian field distribution; the width of this distribution \sigma_{sc} has been shown previously to be proportional to the superfluid density \sigma_{sc}\propton_{s}/m^{*}\propto1/\lambda^{2},[28]\sigma_{sc} was first obtained by fitting the \muSR data in the time domain to the functional form,

\[A(t)=A_{0}e^{-\sigma^{2}t^{2}/2}\cos(\omega t+\phi)+A_{bg}\cos(\omega_{bg}t+ \phi)\,.\] (3)

The nonrelaxing background term was included to account for the muons stopping in the silver sample holder. The first term gives the total sample relaxation rate \sigma; there are contributions from both the vortex lattice and nuclear dipole moments below T_{c}. The contribution from the vortex lattice, \sigma_{sc}, was determined by quadratically subtracting the background nuclear dipolar relaxation rate obtained from spectra measured above T_{c}.

Figure 6 depicts the TF muon spin relaxation rate (proportional to superfluid density) vs temperature for our two Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} samples. Sample 1 was investigated with both TF=500 G and 3 kG while sample 2 was investigated only in 500 G. The sample 1 data indicates that the superfluid density decreases with increasing applied field as expected. The superfluid density of the two samples at 500 G as T\rightarrow 0 is noticeably different; sample 2 has a higher superfluid density than sample 1 and this is consistent with the higher quality of the former. However, the temperature dependence of the superfluid density is the same for both samples: namely, the superfluid density seems to saturate as T\rightarrow 0. Since conventional BCS theory predicts an exponentially flat temperature dependence of the superfluid density at low temperatures, we proceeded to fit our data to this model. The agreement is quite good for both samples as seen in Fig. 6, and so this suggests that this material is characterized by a superconducting gap function with no nodes. For TF =500 G, fitting to the single-gap BCS model gave us the following parameters: 2\Delta/kT_{c}=4.74(9) (2\Delta=1.6 meV), T_{c} =3.8(1) K, and \lambda(T\rightarrow 0)\,=3570(20) A for sample 1 and 2\Delta/kT_{c}=4.93(5) (2\Delta=1.6 meV), T_{c}=3.7(1) K and \lambda(T\rightarrow 0)\,=3230(20) A for sample 2. Note that our 2\Delta/kT_{c} values are only slightly larger than what one expects for weak-coupled BCS theory and that the penetration depth values were obtained from \sigma_{sc} through a conversion procedure outlined in Ref. 29. The significantly suppressed T_{c}'s in only a modest applied field of 500 G are consistent with the relatively low H_{c2}\sim 8 kG (Ref. 16) of this system.

Motivated by the earlier work proposing multigap superconductivity in Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16},[16, 20] we also tried to fit our data to a phenomenological two-gap model as described

Figure 5: Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} sample 1 normalized asymmetry vs time and the corresponding fast-Fourier transforms at TF=500 G for both 6 K [shown in (a) and (b)] and 0.1 K [shown in (c) and (d)]. While the increased broadening is apparent for T= 0.1 K, the characteristic Abrikosov time shape was not observed. This is likely due to the large background signal superimposed on the data.

Figure 6: (Color online) TF-\muSR superconducting relaxation rate \sigma_{sc} vs temperature. The data can be adequately fit to a single-gap BCS model, as indicated by the solid lines.

  elsewhere.[30] Since the fitting routine assigned a weighting of 0 (within our error bars) to one of the gaps, we found that a two-gap model does not seem to describe our data unless the two gaps are very similar in magnitude. However, we note that previous measurements of Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} suggesting multigap superconductivity were essentially performed in ZF while our \muSR measurements were performed in an applied field. While a recent \muSR penetration depth measurement performed by our group on the superconductor Ba(Fe_{0.926}Co_{0.074})_{2}As_{2} found evidence for multigap superconductivity in that material, the same measurements also revealed that the relative weighting factor of the smaller gap quickly approaches 0 with increasing TF.[30] This could also be applicable to the present case.

Although the above results come with the warning that previous \muSR measurements on polycrystalline cuprate samples have resulted in the correct temperature dependence of the superfluid density being masked, this may be less of a concern in the present case due to the cubic crystal symmetry and hence the isotropic penetration depth. In any event, future penetration depth measurements should be conducted on single crystals when they become available to confirm our results.

In conclusion, we have used both ZF and TF-\muSR to investigate the superconductivity in two samples of the non-centrosymmetric system Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16}. In the higher quality sample, ZF-\muSR measurements find no evidence for time-reversal symmetry-breaking fields larger than 0.05 G. TF-\muSR measurements of both samples yield a superfluid density that is exponentially flat at low temperatures, and so our data can be fit to a single-gap BCS model. These findings suggest that Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16} is a superconductor characterized by a single-gap function with no nodes. Our work also suggests that the superconducting properties of this system are very sensitive to sample quality and so further studies are required to investigate the roles of both SOC and defects/ impurities on the superconductivity of this material in more detail.
