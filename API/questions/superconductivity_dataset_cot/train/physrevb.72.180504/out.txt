###### Abstract

We report the zero-resistivity transition and the details of the magnetic transition of a layered silver oxide Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6} single crystal, which provide definitive evidence of superconductivity in this compound. In the ac susceptibility of a monocrystal, we observed large supercooling, as well as positive peaks in the real part of the susceptibility indicating the reversibility of the magnetic process. These observations reveal that Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6} is an oxide that shows type-I superconductivity. Evaluation of the superconducting parameters not only gives confirming evidence of type-I superconductivity, but also indicates that it is a dirty-limit superconductor. We also analyze supercooling to determine the upper limit of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter.

In the last two decades, research of oxide superconductors has become one of the most actively studied fields in solid state physics.[1, 2] Copper oxide high-T_{\rm c} superconductors[3] discovered in 1987 made the greatest impact to the field. Sr_{2}RuO_{4}[4] with accumulating evidence for a spin-triplet superconductor,[5] has attracted much attention. More recently, Na_{x}CoO_{2}\cdot yH_{2}O with a triangular lattice[6] has been widely studied because of the coexistence of superconductivity and possible geometrical frustration. We note here that the unconventional superconductors of oxides listed above have layered structures, and that it is believed a quasi-two-dimensional crystal structure is more favorable for unconventional superconductivity than three-dimensional structures. As possible candidates for unconventional superconductivity, silver oxides are particularly worth investigation, since they might have electronic structures analogous to the high-T_{\rm c} cuprates. However, the silver oxide superconductors reported so far were the cubic clathrate salts Ag_{7}O_{8}_X_ (X=NO_{3}, HF_{2}, etc.)[7] found in 1966. Curiously, no other silver oxide superconductors have been reported for nearly 40 years, let alone those with layered structures.

Here we report on superconductivity in Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6}, with T_{\rm c} of 52.4 mK, an eagerly awaited layered silver oxide superconductor. We also found that superconductivity of Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6} is type I. Most known type-I superconductors are pure metals and only a handful are reported among compounds and alloys, these compound type-I superconductors include YbSb_{5},[8] LaPd_{2}Ge,[9]MPd_{2}Si_{2} (M=Lu, Y, La),[10] TaSi_{2},[11] AuIn_{2},[12]_{\rm C},K_{1},[13] (intercalation) and LaRh_{2}Si_{2},[10]

Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6}, which was reported by Bystrom and Evers in 1950,[14] has a rather interesting crystal structure (see the inset of Fig. 1) consisting of a silver Kagome lattice parallel to its ab plane and silver chains along the c axis.[15] This silver oxide exhibits metallic conductivity. Band calculation by Brennan and Burdett[16] shows that its conductivity mainly comes from the Ag5s orbital, and that its Fermi surface has a quasi-three-dimensional character because both the silver chain and Kagome lattice contribute to the density of states at the Fermi level. Interestingly, the resistivity behaves as \rho =AT^{2}+\rho_{0} in an unusually wide range of temperature, down to below 4 K and up to room temperature.[17] This means that an unknown strong scattering mechanism dominates over the usual electron-phonon scattering. Superconductivity of Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6} was recently suggested by the present authors.[17] We reported quite a large diamagnetic signal in the ac susceptibility measured using a cluster of single crystals below 48 mK but could not obtain zero resistivity at that time. We finally observed zero resistivity by improving experimental techniques, and present in this paper not only the observation, but also the details, of the superconducting properties of Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6}.

In the experiments, we used single crystals of Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6} grown by the self-flux method, from a mixture of 5-mmol AgNO_{3} and 1-mmol Pb(NO_{3})_{2}.[17] All the measurements reported here were performed with a ^{4}He-^{3}He dilution refrigerator (Cryoconcept, Model DR-JT-S-100-10), covering the measurement temperatures as low as 16 mK. The resistivity was measured using a conventional four-probe method with an ac current of 10.4 \muA rms at 163 Hz with a hexagonal-stick single crystal that fits in 0.14\times0.21\times1.15 mm^{3}. We

Hysteretic behavior at the transition is attributable to a residual magnetic field. The inset photo on the left shows the single crystal used for the measurements.

 used pure gallium to attach electrical wires of copper to the sample crystals. We note here that one must keep the temperature of the electrodes well below the melting point of gallium (29 degC) all the time after soldering in order to avoid the electrical contacts getting worse. We avoided using gold wires because gallium easily dissolves gold. The ac susceptibility was measured by a mutual inductance method. We fabricated a very small and highly sensitive cell by winding a 50-\mum-diam copper wire on a 0.5-\mum-diam polyimide tube (The Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd., PIT-S). The excitation field H_{\rm dc} was 8.7 mOe rms at 887 Hz, which is much lower than the H_{\rm c} of Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6}. To reduce the influences of remnant magnetic fields such as the earth's field and the residual field in the equipment, these measurements were performed in a magnetic shield. We used a cylinder of permalloy (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., E989-28), which has an extremely high permeability. Inside the permalloy tube, we also placed a lead cylinder with a closed bottom, to expel the remaining magnetic flux. The dc magnetic field for the measurements was applied with a small solenoidal coil of Nb-Ti superconducting wire placed inside the shield. The magnitude of the dc field H_{\rm dc} is numerically calculated by taking into account the shielding current on lead shield's surface.[18; 19]

The observed zero-resistivity transition is shown in Fig. 1. A clear zero resistivity is seen, which marks definitive evidence of the superconductivity of Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6}. We note here that the result in Fig. 1 was obtained without the magnetic shield. A hysteresis at the superconducting transition and a lower T_{\rm c} than that in the ac susceptibility measurement are attributable to the influence of the uncanceled residual field. We confirmed that the hysteresis indeed disappears in the measurement with the magnetic shield. We next show in Fig. 2 the real part of the ac susceptibility \chi^{\prime}_{\rm ac} of a monocrystal with the magnetic shield described above. It is worth noting that we used the identical crystal for the measurements for Figs. 1 and 2 (see the left inset of Fig. 1). We also note here that the diamagnetic signal shown in Fig. 2 is as large as that of pure Al with a similar size and shape. Such results of the low-frequency susceptibility add a strong support for the bulk nature of the superconductivity in Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6}. The measurements were performed under the condition H_{\rm dc}\|H_{\rm ac}\|c. The critical temperature T_{\rm c} to some extent depends on samples; the highest T_{\rm c} obtained is 52.4 mK, as shown in Fig. 2.

In Fig. 2, there are two strong pieces of evidence that Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6} is a type-I superconductor. One is the fact that a large supercooling is observed at the superconducting transition under magnetic fields while no supercooling is seen in zero field. This means that the superconducting transition becomes first order only when an external field is applied. Such behavior is only seen in type-I superconductors. The other is the very large positive peaks of \chi^{\prime}_{\rm ac} just before the superconducting to normal transitions. These peaks are ascribable to the "differential paramagnetic effect" (DPE),[20] which represents that the field derivative of the magnetization \partial M/\partial H is positive near the transition and also the magnetic process in this region is reversible. DPE should be observed in either type-I and type-II superconductors, if pinning of domain walls in the intermediate state of type-I superconductors or of magnetic flux in the mixed state of type II is absent or very weak. However the observed sharp and large DPE near the transition is a hallmark of type-I superconductivity, since \partial M/\partial H in type-II superconductors should be much smaller than 1 near H_{\rm c2} and thus the height of DPE in type-II superconductors cannot exceed |\chi^{\prime}_{\rm dia}|, where \chi^{\prime}_{\rm dia} is the diamagnetic susceptibility in the Meissner state.[21] We note that preliminary results show supercooling and DPE also for field along the ab plane. Such observation supports that they are intrinsic behavior.[22]

Figure 3 is the phase diagram based on the ac susceptibility of the crystal with the highest T_{\rm c}. Here we identify the transition fields of the superconducting to normal transition as critical fields H_{\rm c}. This should be valid despite the possibility of superheating, because the observed DPE shows that Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6} is in the intermediate state, in which superconducting and normal states coexist, and there should be no superheating at the "transition" from the intermediate state to the normal state. We also define the normal to superconduct

The residual field H_{\rm sc}, has been compensated in this sweep, yielding T_{\rm c0}=52.4 mK. (b) The results of field sweeps at several temperatures with a sweep rate of 24–47 mOe/min. From the slight asymmetry of the data, the residual field is estimated as H_{\rm sc}=0.040 Oe. The double peaks seen in 45 and 47 mK do not seem to be intrinsic, since they are not reproducible with other crystals.

  ing transition fields as supercooling fields H_{\rm sc}. This transition should be from the normal to the full Meissner states since we observed no DPE. We can fit a relation H_{\rm c}(T) =H_{\rm c0}[1-(TT_{\rm c0})^{\alpha}] to all the H_{\rm c} data down to 16 mK using H_{\rm c0} and \alpha as fitting parameters, while T_{\rm c0}=52.4 mK is determined from the temperature sweep data in zero field. As a result, we obtained H_{\rm c0}=2.19 Oe and \alpha=1.56. The data can also be fitted by a conventional relation with \alpha=2:H_{\rm c}(T) =H_{\rm c0}^{\prime}[1-(T/T_{\rm c0})^{2}]. However, the fitting is successful only down to TT_{\rm c}=0.7 and the resulting parameter is H_{\rm c0}^{\prime} =1.80 Oe. The origin of this discrepancy is unknown at this stage of experiments. One possible origin is the modification of critical fields due to the large coherence length and the small sample size.

Now we can evaluate some of the superconducting parameters from these results. First, the London penetration depth is obtained as \lambda_{\rm z}(0)= (m^{*}c^{2}/4\,m\epsilon^{2})^{1/2}=83 nm. Here n=1.0/V_{\rm M}=0.51 \times 10^{22} electrons/cm^{3} is the electron carrier density, where V_{\rm M}=0.195 m^{3} is the volume of a unit cell [23], and m^{*}=(3\hbar^{2}\,\gamma_{\rm c})/(k_{\rm B}^{2})=1.2m_{\rm e} is the effective mass. We used here the measured electronic specific heat coefficient [17]\gamma_{\rm c}=3.42 mJ/mol K^{2}=291 erg/cm^{3} K^{2}, and the Fermi wave number k_{\rm F}=4.5 nm^{-1} (in the ab plane [24]). The coherence length in clean limit, \xi_{0}=(0.18hv_{\rm F})/(k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c})=11 \mum, where v_{\rm F}=\hbark_{\rm F}/m is the Fermi velocity, is comparable to that of tungsten^{2} (\xi_{0}=32 \mum, T_{\rm c}=15.4 mK). The mean free path l is given by l=v_{\rm F}, where \tau is the scattering time of electrons and has a relation \tau^{-1}=n\epsilon^{2}\rho/m^{*} for the Drude model. If we use \rho=1.5 \mu\Omega cm, the residual resistivity in the ab plane [17], we obtain l=240 nm.

One of the important consequences of the above evaluation is that Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6} is a dirty-limit (\xi_{0}\ggl) superconductor. This is rather inevitable, since it seems practically impossible to make l longer than \xi_{0}. In a dirty-limit superconductor, the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter \kappa is given by \kappa =0.75\lambda_{\rm L}(0)/l[26], and is 0.26 in our case. This is indeed smaller than 1/\sqrt{2}, the border between type-I and -II superconductors, and is consistent with the type-I behavior of Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6}. The dirty-limit conclusion also implies that the pairing symmetry of the superconductivity is not anisotropic, because anisotropic superconductivity should be easily suppressed even by nonmagnetic impurities.

According to the GL theory, analysis of supercooling gives the upper limit of \kappa. When one decreases the external field of a supercooled superconductor at constant temperature, the sample turns into the superconducting state before the field reaches the ideal supercooling field H_{\rm sc,ideal}. If the sample is in vacuum, H_{\rm sc,ideal} is equal to the surface nucleation field H_{\rm c3}[27], which has a relation H_{\rm c3}=1.695H_{\rm c2} =1.695\sqrt{2}\kappaH_{\rm c}. The observed supercooling field H_{\rm sc} satisfies an inequality

\[H_{\rm sc}\gg H_{\rm sc,ideal}=1.695\sqrt{2}\kappa H_{\rm c}.\] (1)

Thus \kappa must be smaller than \kappa_{\rm sc}=H_{\rm sc}/(1.695\sqrt{2}H_{\rm c}).

An approach based on this has been used to determine \kappa of several pure metals and alloys by observing _ideal_ supercooling. For example, Feder and McLachlan [28] realized ideal supercooling of indium and tin with precise experiments and obtained \kappa_{\rm lin}=0.0620 and \kappa_{\rm lin}=0.0926.

We calculated \kappa_{\rm sc} of Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6} at each temperature as shown in Fig. 4. The steep increase of \kappa_{\rm sc} at T/T_{\rm c}\geq0.9 is attributed to the size effect, which occurs when the temperature-dependent coherence length \xi(T)\propto[T_{\rm c}/(T_{\rm c}-T)][1/2\xi becomes comparable to the size of a sample. In the coherence length, being \xi\sim (\xi_{0})^{1/2} in a dirty-limit superconductor [26], becomes 1.4 \mum. This is large enough to cause the size effect near T_{\rm c} in a sample of 100-200 \mum(\sim100\xi). Indeed, in the experiments of Feder and McLachlan [28] a sphere of clean indium (\xi\sim

The filled squares are the superconducting to normal transition field and should be equal to H_{\rm c} (see text). The crosses are the supercooling field H_{\rm sc} corresponding to the normal to superconducting transitions.

  =0.20 \mum) with a radius 16 \mum(\sim80\xi) showed the size effect also at T/T_{\rm c}\geq0.9.

Feder and McLachlan determined \kappa by extrapolating \kappa(T) to T=T_{\rm c}, because the influence of nucleation centers becomes negligible near T_{\rm c} due to the divergence of \xi(T). Following their procedure we extrapolated \kappa_{\rm c}(T) in 35 mK<T<47 mK to T_{\rm c} as the broken line in Fig. 4. The extrapolation gives \kappa_{\rm c}|r_{T_{\rm c}}=0.085, which should be the upper limit of \kappa of Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6}. This estimated upper limit is smaller than the calculated value but the difference should be within a consistency. In the case of indium or tin,[28] there are also differences of a few factors among values of \kappa obtained by different procedures.

In conclusion, we succeeded in observing the zero-resistivity transition of a silver oxide Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6}, giving definitive evidence of the long-awaited layered silver oxide superconductor since the discovery of high-T_{\rm c} cuprates. The ac susceptibility reveals that Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6} is an oxide type-I superconductor. It is widely considered that type-I superconductivity is rare in compounds, although there is no fundamental reason to prohibit it. The present paper indeed demonstrates that even an oxide can be an extreme type-I superconductor. Superconducting parameters indicate that Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6} is a dirty-limit type-I superconductor and thus the pairing symmetry of Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6} should be isotropic. The report of this class of superconductor, a silver oxide superconductor with a layered structure, should motivate searches for more superconductors among similar silver oxides. A salient next target is to adjust the doping to realize the electronic states with strong electron correlations, closely analogous to that of the high-T_{\rm c} cuprates, in order to seek for unconventional superconductivity.

_Note added in proof._ The band structure reported in Ref. 16 has been substantially revised by a recent calculation[29] and by a recent experiment of quantum oscillations.[30] Nevertheless, the value of k_{\rm F} used in this paper remains consistent with the recent reports.

The magnitude of the dc field H_{\rm dc} is numerically calculated by taking into account the shielding current on lead shield's surface.[18; 19]

The observed zero-resistivity transition is shown in Fig. 1. A clear zero resistivity is seen, which marks definitive evidence of the superconductivity of Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6}. We note here that the result in Fig. 1 was obtained without the magnetic shield. A hysteresis at the superconducting transition and a lower T_{\rm c} than that in the ac susceptibility measurement are attributable to the influence of the uncanceled residual field. We confirmed that the hysteresis indeed disappears in the measurement with the magnetic shield. We next show in Fig. 2 the real part of the ac susceptibility \chi^{\prime}_{\rm ac} of a monocrystal with the magnetic shield described above. It is worth noting that we used the identical crystal for the measurements for Figs. 1 and 2 (see the left inset of Fig. 1). We also note here that the diamagnetic signal shown in Fig. 2 is as large as that of pure Al with a similar size and shape. Such results of the low-frequency susceptibility add a strong support for the bulk nature of the superconductivity in Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6}. The measurements were performed under the condition H_{\rm dc}\|H_{\rm ac}\|c. The critical temperature T_{\rm c} to some extent depends on samples; the highest T_{\rm c} obtained is 52.4 mK, as shown in Fig. 2.

In Fig. 2, there are two strong pieces of evidence that Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6} is a type-I superconductor. One is the fact that a large supercooling is observed at the superconducting transition under magnetic fields while no supercooling is seen in zero field. This means that the superconducting transition becomes first order only when an external field is applied. Such behavior is only seen in type-I superconductors. The other is the very large positive peaks of \chi^{\prime}_{\rm ac} just before the superconducting to normal transitions. These peaks are ascribable to the "differential paramagnetic effect" (DPE),[20] which represents that the field derivative of the magnetization \partial M/\partial H is positive near the transition and also the magnetic process in this region is reversible. DPE should be observed in either type-I and type-II superconductors, if pinning of domain walls in the intermediate state of type-I superconductors or of magnetic flux in the mixed state of type II is absent or very weak. However the observed sharp and large DPE near the transition is a hallmark of type-I superconductivity, since \partial M/\partial H in type-II superconductors should be much smaller than 1 near H_{\rm c2} and thus the height of DPE in type-II superconductors cannot exceed |\chi^{\prime}_{\rm dia}|, where \chi^{\prime}_{\rm dia} is the diamagnetic susceptibility in the Meissner state.[21] We note that preliminary results show supercooling and DPE also for field along the ab plane. Such observation supports that they are intrinsic behavior.[22]

Figure 3 is the phase diagram based on the ac susceptibility of the crystal with the highest T_{\rm c}. Here we identify the transition fields of the superconducting to normal transition as critical fields H_{\rm c}. This should be valid despite the possibility of superheating, because the observed DPE shows that Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6} is in the intermediate state, in which superconducting and normal states coexist, and there should be no superheating at the "transition" from the intermediate state to the normal state. We also define the normal to superconduct

The residual field H_{\rm sc}, has been compensated in this sweep, yielding T_{\rm c0}=52.4 mK. (b) The results of field sweeps at several temperatures with a sweep rate of 24–47 mOe/min. From the slight asymmetry of the data, the residual field is estimated as H_{\rm sc}=0.040 Oe. The double peaks seen in 45 and 47 mK do not seem to be intrinsic, since they are not reproducible with other crystals.

  ing transition fields as supercooling fields H_{\rm sc}. This transition should be from the normal to the full Meissner states since we observed no DPE. We can fit a relation H_{\rm c}(T) =H_{\rm c0}[1-(TT_{\rm c0})^{\alpha}] to all the H_{\rm c} data down to 16 mK using H_{\rm c0} and \alpha as fitting parameters, while T_{\rm c0}=52.4 mK is determined from the temperature sweep data in zero field. As a result, we obtained H_{\rm c0}=2.19 Oe and \alpha=1.56. The data can also be fitted by a conventional relation with \alpha=2:H_{\rm c}(T) =H_{\rm c0}^{\prime}[1-(T/T_{\rm c0})^{2}]. However, the fitting is successful only down to TT_{\rm c}=0.7 and the resulting parameter is H_{\rm c0}^{\prime} =1.80 Oe. The origin of this discrepancy is unknown at this stage of experiments. One possible origin is the modification of critical fields due to the large coherence length and the small sample size.

Now we can evaluate some of the superconducting parameters from these results. First, the London penetration depth is obtained as \lambda_{\rm z}(0)= (m^{*}c^{2}/4\,m\epsilon^{2})^{1/2}=83 nm. Here n=1.0/V_{\rm M}=0.51 \times 10^{22} electrons/cm^{3} is the electron carrier density, where V_{\rm M}=0.195 m^{3} is the volume of a unit cell [23], and m^{*}=(3\hbar^{2}\,\gamma_{\rm c})/(k_{\rm B}^{2})=1.2m_{\rm e} is the effective mass. We used here the measured electronic specific heat coefficient [17]\gamma_{\rm c}=3.42 mJ/mol K^{2}=291 erg/cm^{3} K^{2}, and the Fermi wave number k_{\rm F}=4.5 nm^{-1} (in the ab plane [24]). The coherence length in clean limit, \xi_{0}=(0.18hv_{\rm F})/(k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c})=11 \mum, where v_{\rm F}=\hbark_{\rm F}/m is the Fermi velocity, is comparable to that of tungsten^{2} (\xi_{0}=32 \mum, T_{\rm c}=15.4 mK). The mean free path l is given by l=v_{\rm F}, where \tau is the scattering time of electrons and has a relation \tau^{-1}=n\epsilon^{2}\rho/m^{*} for the Drude model. If we use \rho=1.5 \mu\Omega cm, the residual resistivity in the ab plane [17], we obtain l=240 nm.

One of the important consequences of the above evaluation is that Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6} is a dirty-limit (\xi_{0}\ggl) superconductor. This is rather inevitable, since it seems practically impossible to make l longer than \xi_{0}. In a dirty-limit superconductor, the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter \kappa is given by \kappa =0.75\lambda_{\rm L}(0)/l[26], and is 0.26 in our case. This is indeed smaller than 1/\sqrt{2}, the border between type-I and -II superconductors, and is consistent with the type-I behavior of Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6}. The dirty-limit conclusion also implies that the pairing symmetry of the superconductivity is not anisotropic, because anisotropic superconductivity should be easily suppressed even by nonmagnetic impurities.

According to the GL theory, analysis of supercooling gives the upper limit of \kappa. When one decreases the external field of a supercooled superconductor at constant temperature, the sample turns into the superconducting state before the field reaches the ideal supercooling field H_{\rm sc,ideal}. If the sample is in vacuum, H_{\rm sc,ideal} is equal to the surface nucleation field H_{\rm c3}[27], which has a relation H_{\rm c3}=1.695H_{\rm c2} =1.695\sqrt{2}\kappaH_{\rm c}. The observed supercooling field H_{\rm sc} satisfies an inequality

\[H_{\rm sc}\gg H_{\rm sc,ideal}=1.695\sqrt{2}\kappa H_{\rm c}.\] (1)

Thus \kappa must be smaller than \kappa_{\rm sc}=H_{\rm sc}/(1.695\sqrt{2}H_{\rm c}).

An approach based on this has been used to determine \kappa of several pure metals and alloys by observing _ideal_ supercooling. For example, Feder and McLachlan [28] realized ideal supercooling of indium and tin with precise experiments and obtained \kappa_{\rm lin}=0.0620 and \kappa_{\rm lin}=0.0926.

We calculated \kappa_{\rm sc} of Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6} at each temperature as shown in Fig. 4. The steep increase of \kappa_{\rm sc} at T/T_{\rm c}\geq0.9 is attributed to the size effect, which occurs when the temperature-dependent coherence length \xi(T)\propto[T_{\rm c}/(T_{\rm c}-T)][1/2\xi becomes comparable to the size of a sample. In the coherence length, being \xi\sim (\xi_{0})^{1/2} in a dirty-limit superconductor [26], becomes 1.4 \mum. This is large enough to cause the size effect near T_{\rm c} in a sample of 100-200 \mum(\sim100\xi). Indeed, in the experiments of Feder and McLachlan [28] a sphere of clean indium (\xi\sim

The residual field has been subtracted in the shield H_{\rm res} =0.040 Oe from the raw data. The filled squares are the superconducting to normal transition field and should be equal to H_{\rm c} (see text). The crosses are the supercooling field H_{\rm sc} corresponding to the normal to superconducting transitions.

  =0.20 \mum) with a radius 16 \mum(\sim80\xi) showed the size effect also at T/T_{\rm c}\geq0.9.

Feder and McLachlan determined \kappa by extrapolating \kappa(T) to T=T_{\rm c}, because the influence of nucleation centers becomes negligible near T_{\rm c} due to the divergence of \xi(T). Following their procedure we extrapolated \kappa_{\rm c}(T) in 35 mK<T<47 mK to T_{\rm c} as the broken line in Fig. 4. The extrapolation gives \kappa_{\rm c}|r_{T_{\rm c}}=0.085, which should be the upper limit of \kappa of Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6}. This estimated upper limit is smaller than the calculated value but the difference should be within a consistency. In the case of indium or tin,[28] there are also differences of a few factors among values of \kappa obtained by different procedures.

In conclusion, we succeeded in observing the zero-resistivity transition of a silver oxide Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6}, giving definitive evidence of the long-awaited layered silver oxide superconductor since the discovery of high-T_{\rm c} cuprates. The ac susceptibility reveals that Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6} is an oxide type-I superconductor. It is widely considered that type-I superconductivity is rare in compounds, although there is no fundamental reason to prohibit it. The present paper indeed demonstrates that even an oxide can be an extreme type-I superconductor. Superconducting parameters indicate that Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6} is a dirty-limit type-I superconductor and thus the pairing symmetry of Ag_{5}Pb_{2}O_{6} should be isotropic. The report of this class of superconductor, a silver oxide superconductor with a layered structure, should motivate searches for more superconductors among similar silver oxides. A salient next target is to adjust the doping to realize the electronic states with strong electron correlations, closely analogous to that of the high-T_{\rm c} cuprates, in order to seek for unconventional superconductivity.

_Note added in proof._ The band structure reported in Ref. 16 has been substantially revised by a recent calculation[29] and by a recent experiment of quantum oscillations.[30] Nevertheless, the value of k_{\rm F} used in this paper remains consistent with the recent reports.
