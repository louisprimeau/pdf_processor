###### Abstract

Superconducting upper critical fields \(H_{\rm c2}(T)\), transition temperatures \(T_{\rm c}\), and normal-state electrical resistivities \(\rho_{\rm s}\) have been measured in the amorphous transition-metal alloy series \({\rm Zr}_{1-x}{\rm Co}_{x}\), \({\rm Zr}_{1-x}{\rm Ni}_{x}\), \(({\rm Zr}_{1-x}{\rm Ti}_{x})_{0.78}{\rm Ni}_{0.22}\), and \(({\rm Zr}_{1-x}{\rm Nb}_{x})_{0.78}{\rm Ni}_{0.22}\). Structural integrity of these melt-spun alloys is indicated by x-ray, density, bend-ductility, normal-state electrical resistivity, superconducting transition width, and mixed-state flux-pinning measurements. The specimens display \(T_{\rm c}\) = 2.1-3.8 K, \(\rho_{\rm s}\) = 159-190 \(\mu\Omega\) cm, and \(\mid(dH_{\rm c2}/dT)_{T_{\rm c}}\mid\) = 28-36 kG/K. These imply electron mean free paths \(l\) \(\approx\) 2-6 A, zero-temperature Ginzburg-Landau coherence distances \(\xi_{G0}\) \(\approx\) 50-70 A, penetration depths \(\lambda_{G0}\) \(\approx\) (7-10) \(\times\) 10\({}^{3}\) A, and extremely high dirtiness parameters \(\xi_{0}/l\) \(\approx\) 300-1300. All alloys display \(H_{\rm c2}(T)\) curves with _negative_ curvature and (with two exceptions) fair agreement with the standard dirty-limit theory of Werthamer, Helfand, Hohenberg, and Maki (WHHM) for physically reasonable values of spin-orbit-coupling induced, electron-spin-flip scattering time \(\tau_{\rm so}\). This is in contrast to the anomalously elevated \(H_{\rm c2}(T)\) behavior which is nearly linear in \(T\) that is observed by some, and the unphysically low-\(\tau_{\rm so}\) fits to WHHM theory obtained by others, for various amorphous alloys. Current ideas that such anomalies may be due to alloy inhomogeneity are supported by present results on two specimens for which relatively low-\(\tau_{\rm so}\) fits of \(H_{\rm c2}(T)\) to WHHM theory are coupled with superconductive evidence for inhomogeneity: relatively broad transitions at \(T_{\rm c}\) and \(H_{\rm c2}\), current-density-dependent transitions at \(H_{\rm c2}\), and (in one specimen) a \(J\)-dependent, high-\(H(>H_{\rm c2}\)), resistive "peak effect." In the \({\rm Zr}_{1-x}{\rm Co}_{x}\) and \({\rm Zr}_{1-x}{\rm Ni}_{x}\) series, \(T_{\rm c}\) decreases linearly with \(x\) (and with unfilled-shell average electron-to-atom ratio \(\langle\)_e/a_\(\rangle\) in the range \(5.05\leq\langle\)_e/a_\(\rangle\leq 6.40\)) in fair agreement with previous results for these systems and contrary to the \(T_{\rm c}\) vs \(\langle\)_e/a_\(\rangle\) behavior of both amorphous and crystalline transition-metal alloys formed between near neighbors in the Periodic Table. Upper-critical-field and normal-state electrical resistivity measurements suggest that the molar electronic specific-heat coefficient \(\gamma_{m}\) decreases with \(x\) in parallel with \(T_{\rm c}\) in the \({\rm Zr}_{1-x}{\rm Co}_{x}\) and \({\rm Zr}_{1-x}{\rm Ni}_{x}\) series. In the equal-\(\langle\)_e/a_\(\rangle\) (\({\rm Zr}_{1-x}{\rm Ti}_{x})_{0.78}{\rm Ni}_{0.22}\) system, \(T_{\rm c}\) decreases with \(x\); in the \(({\rm Zr}_{1-x}{\rm Nb}_{x})_{0.78}{\rm Ni}_{0.22}\) system, \(T_{\rm c}\) first increases and then decreases with \(x\) (hence with \(\langle\)_e/a_\(\rangle\)). These diverse \(\langle\)_e/a_\(\rangle\) dependencies of \(T_{\rm c}\) appear consistent with the ultraviolet-photoemission-spectroscopy indicated split-band model of such amorphous transition-metal alloys and the associated idea that the alloying dependence of \(T_{\rm c}\) cannot be described by general \(T_{\rm c}\) vs \(\langle\)_e/a_\(\rangle\) rules.

## 1 Introduction

Despite their technological promise,[1] the electronic,[2, 3] superconducting,[4, 5, 6] and magnetic[7] behavior of amorphous metals and alloys is not well understood. From the research standpoint it is of particular interest to examine transition metals in the extreme "dirty" limit of amorphous atomic disorder. Here the destruction of translational symmetry, although negating much of standard theory, might act to simplify some properties by suppressing fine structure in the electronic and vibrational spectra. Such smoothing could lead to general, albeit possibly unusual, behavior (e.g., the Mooij correlation,[8] the Collver-Hammond superconducting transition-temperature peak[9, 10]) thus allowing greater eventual insight into the nature of \(d\)-electron metallic behavior.

Added impetus to the study of amorphous transition metals has been generated by the increasing availability of bulk specimens, kinetically (if not thermodynamically) stable at room temperature. These can now be obtained as "metallic glasses," quenched from the liquid at about 10\({}^{6}\) K/sec by various melt-spinning or melt-splatting techniques.[11] Unfortunately, the measurements of different lab oratories on independently produced metallic glasses are not always in good agreement, evidently due to the sensitivity of some measured properties to details of the quenching and fabrication procedures.

One area of such disagreement has arisen in the determination of the temperature dependence of the upper critical fields \(H_{\epsilon 2}(T)\) of amorphous transition-metal (TM) superconductors. For many years there have been reports in the literature[12]\({}^{-}\)[19] that their \(H_{\epsilon 2}(T)\) curves displayed an unusual linearity in \(T\). However, most of these measurements were made at relatively high reduced temperatures \(t\equiv T/T_{\epsilon}>\sim 0.6\) where near linearity might be expected. On the other hand, one investigation which allowed a meaningful comparison with theory, that of Togano and Tachikawa[20] on amorphous Zr\({}_{0.77}\)Rh\({}_{0.23}\) down to \(t=0.4\), showed negative curvature in \(H_{\epsilon 2}(T)\), in fair accordance with the standard weak coupling, "dirty-limit" theory of Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg[21] and Maki[22] (WHHM).

More recently, several groups[23]\({}^{-}\)[25] have reported dramatically enhanced \(H_{\epsilon 2}(T)\) that is nearly linear in \(T\) down to reduced temperatures as low as 0.2 ["Tenhover linearity"[23] (TL)], while others[26]\({}^{-}\)[31] observe nonenhanced behavior that has negative curvature in \(T\) more like that predicted by the WHHM theory. Tenhover _et al._ suggested[23] that TL in glassy TM was associated with precursor electron localization in their high normal-state electrical resistivity \(\rho_{n}=120-180\)\(\mu\Omega\) cm specimens, where the electron mean free path \(l\) approximates interatomic distances (the Ioffe-Regel[32] condition). Despite some transport-property evidence[33]\({}^{-}\)[36] for very weak precursor-electron-localization effects in high-\(\rho_{n}\) bulk alloys, the association[23] of TL with high-\(\rho_{n}\)-indicated precursor electron localization would appear questionable, since WHHM theory is in fair agreement with \(H_{\epsilon 2}(T)\) curves measured for disordered crystalline TM alloys with \(\rho_{n}=100-150\)\(\mu\Omega\) cm.[37]\({}^{-}\)[39] In addition, Carter _et al.[27]_ observed TL in amorphous Mo\({}_{0.78}\)Ge\({}_{0.22}\) in which transmission electron microscopy disclosed (50\(-\)200)-A bcc crystallites and absence of TL in more homogeneous specimens. They were thus led to suggest that inhomogeneities on the order of the zero-temperature Ginzburg-Landau coherence length (\(\xi_{G0}\approx 30-100\) A in dirty alloys) could be responsible for TL. Such fine-scale inhomogeneity might not be apparent in ordinary x-ray diffraction studies, nor would it produce broadening of the superconducting transition in zero applied magnetic field since \(\xi_{G}(T)\) =\(\xi_{G0}[1-(T/T_{\epsilon})]^{-1/2}\) becomes so large near \(T_{\epsilon}\) that spatial averaging would occur over regions much larger than the inhomogeneity scale. More recently, other investigators[31]\({}^{,}\)[40]\({}^{,}\)[41] have adduced various types of evidence in support of the above inhomogeneity interpretation,[27] but detailed understanding of \(H_{\epsilon 2}(T)\) behavior in amorphous TM alloy superconductors has not yet been achieved.

In this paper,[42] an extension of earlier work,[28]\({}^{,}\)[43] we report studies of the upper critical fields \(H_{\epsilon 2}(T)\) and superconducting transition temperatures \(T_{\epsilon}\) in four Zr-base, metallic-glass alloy series: Zr\({}_{1-x}\)Co\({}_{x}\), Zr\({}_{1-x}\)Ni\({}_{x}\), (Zr\({}_{1-x}\)Ti\({}_{x}\)\({}_{0.78}\)Ni\({}_{0.22}\), and (Zr\({}_{1-x}\)Nb\({}_{x}\))\({}_{0.78}\)Ni\({}_{0.22}\). Since the above history would suggest the sensitivity of such properties to fabrication techniques, we report melt-spinning procedures and structure-related studies (x-ray, density, normal-state electrical resistivity, superconducting transition width, flux-pinning, and flux-flow characteristics) in some detail, and compare where possible our results with those of others on amorphous alloys made independently in other laboratories. In a planned subsequent paper[36] we shall report the extension of earlier studies[33]\({}^{-}\)[35] of anomalous normal-state electrical resistance behavior (negative temperature coefficients of resistivity and negative magnetoresistance) in these and other high-\(\rho_{n}\) glassy and crystalline TM alloys.

## 2 Specimen Fabrication and Characterization

### Fabrication

Table 1 lists some structural properties of the amorphous alloys of the present study. Table 1, column 1 shows the compositions of the 18 specimens. These are all of the so-called "early-late" TM alloy class, commonly designated \(T_{E}T_{L}\). Such alloys were first reported by Ray _et al.[44]_ and are of particular research interest because (a) their various properties may be studied over wide concentration ranges (Table 1, columns 1 and 2) in contrast to TM metalloid glasses, and (b) they do not require stabilization by metalloids, so that some complication in electronic and structural conditions is avoided.

Table 2 lists some properties of the starting materials. These were consolidated by melting etched and weighed amounts in a laboratory arc furnace utilizing a Zr-gettered argon atmosphere, a water-cooled copper hearth, and a tungsten electrode. Each button (3\(-\)30 g) was turned over and remelted at least five times to promote homogeneity. Weight loss during melting was in all cases small enough that alloy compositions could be adequately determined from the weights of materials melted.

Figure 1 shows a schematic of the melt-spinning device, similar to that described by Liebermann and Graham.[50] After arc melting, the usually brittle buttons were broken into fragments, etched to remove surface contamination, and then placed in the

  quartz tube of an induction melter as shown in Fig. 1. The tube was flushed with inert gas, rf power was applied to the surrounding coil so as to melt the alloy, and then an inert-gas overpressure of ~8 psi (gauge) was applied, forcing a molten jet through the (0.4-0.5)-mm-diam orifice in the hemispherical bottom end of the quartz tube. The jet impinged upon the circumferential surface (about 1-2 mm from the quartz-tube orifice) of the 8.8-cm-diam copper wheel rotating at 4500-9200 rpm. The wheel surface was polished just prior to melt spinning with fine emery paper (followed by methanol cleaning) so as to remove the oxide layer and promote thermal contact between melt pool and the wheel. The high-velocity (1.3-2.6 km/min) ribbon was ducted through a copper catching tube into a sealed bell jar where it spiraled to a halt. The entire apparatus was operated in a flowing helium atmosphere so as to retard oxide layer formation, promote ribbon quality,[51] and prevent ignition of the pyrophoric Zr alloys. Ribbons were generally continuous and reasonably uniform in cross section (~25-35 \(\mu\)m thickness, ~1 mm width). The ribbons displayed a shiny top surface which had been less rapidly quenched than the relatively dull bottom surface, since the latter had been in direct contact with the copper disk. Most ribbons could be bent 1802 without fracture[51, 52] (the so-called[53] "bend-ductility test").

### X-ray diffraction

Sections of all ribbons were examined by x-ray diffraction, first using the Debye-Scherrer transmission technique with Ni-filtered copper _K_a radiation. Ribbons which displayed only the typical amorphous-structure diffuse halos with no sharp crystalline lines were then subjected to more sensitive and accurate reflection diffractometry. The Phillips scanning diffractometer, equipped with a scintillation-detector counter and a carbon-crystal diffracted-beam monochromator, displayed excellent resolution and angular accuracy on test scans of a Si-powder standard. About twelve 2.5-cm-long strips were cut from the ribbon and placed side by side and shiny side up on a microscope slide, which was then fastened to the specimen plate of the diffractometer. All such strip arrays were scanned through scattering angles 102 <= 2_th_ <= 1002 using an angular speed of 1 deg/min, detector time constant \(t\) = 2 sec,[54] and copper _K_a radiation.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c}  & & Nominal puritya  & _M_b  & Common structureb  & \(V\)0c  & _Rg_d  & & & _γ_m  \\ Metal & Supplier & Gradea  & Gradea  & (\%) & (g/mol) & structureb  & (Å)a  & (Å)a [FOOTNOTE:a]Footnote a: Making use of the material in the sample.

  Figure 2 shows a scan for an etched array of Zr0.73Ni0.27 strips. The scan is typical of those alloys designated (Table 1, column 6) \(a\) or _a_(_e_) [_a_, amorphous to within resolution of the x-ray scan; (_e_), chemically etched array] in showing the usual amorphous-structure broad peaks with primary 2_th_1 (Table 1, column 3) and secondary 2_th_2 maxima. Sharp spikes which sometimes were superimposed upon the two-broad-peak amorphous background were usually due to reflection from crystalline inclusions on the shiny, less rapidly quenched, top ribbon surface since (a) no evidence for crystallinity had appeared in the volume-averaging transmission Debye-Scherrer photographs, (b) spikes usually disappeared on dull-side-up diffractometer scans, (c) mechanical polishing or chemical etching so as to remove 2-7 _m_m of the shiny surface usually resulted in absence of spikes in subsequent scans.28 Similar observations have been reported by Rapp and co-workers.55,56 Etched specimens for the upper-critical-field and normal-state electrical resistivity measurements were normally taken from the arrays which had been subjected to diffractometry. Some specimens designated (Table 1, column 6) \(a\) or _a_+_c_(_n_) (amorphous but with \(n\) discernible crystal-line spikes) were measured in the unetched condition. As previously reported28 (apparent surface) crystalline inclusions appear to have little effect on the reduced upper-critical-field curves _h_*(_t_) (Sec. III). In the present work the insensitivity of _h_*(_t_) to etching is indicated in Fig. 12 which shows data for Zr0.72Co0.28 before and then after a top-surface etch which eliminated crystalline spikes from its diffractogram.

### Density

The densities \(D\) of all amorphous alloys were determined by the Archimedes47 method, weighing ribbon spools of about 0.5 g first in air and then in CCl4 with a Mettler H31 balance. The density values (Table 1, column 10) were used to reduce geometric uncertainty28,34,57 in normal-state electrical resistivity determinations (Table 3, column 5), and to calculate average atomic volumes \(V\)0 (Table 1, column 11) and amorphous-alloy packing fractions \(e_{a}\) (Table 1, column 12). The latter are all within 2% (Table 1, column 13) of the ideal close-packed (fcc or hcp) crystalline value \(e\) = 0.740, about 16% higher than predicted by unrelaxed single-size dense random packing of hard-spheres (DRPHS) models,58 and about 6% higher than obtained by Johnson and Williams59 for non-_T__E_T_L amorphous Mo0.6Ru0.4 by extrapolation to zero metalloid content. Present density data are in good agreement with those of Dong _et al._,60 but present measurements lie 4% above the determinations of Waseda and Chen61 on amorphous Zr0.70Co0.30 and Zr0.70Ni0.30. Atomic volume versus alloy concentration plots42 show small negative deviations from "Zen's law62 as previously observed for amorphous Zr1-_x_Ni_x alloys,60 and suggestive of some degree of chemical short-range order.

### Electrical resistivity

Table 3 lists various measured and calculated63 electronic and superconducting properties of the present specimens. Measured helium-temperature normal-state electrical resistivities \(r_{a}\)(4.2 K) (Table 3, column 5) for the present amorphous alloys are all very high64,65 (159-190 _m_O cm) in comparison with most (but not all8,33,35-39,66) crystalline TM alloys. Meaningful comparison of metallic glass absolute resistivities measured in different laboratories is hindered by experimental uncertainties associated with thin-strip geometric measurements. In the present work a +-7% uncertainty in \(r_{a}\) was achieved by calculating specimen cross-sectional areas from measured alloy density,28,34,57 and specimen length and mass. The latter (2-5 mg) was measured for each specimen with a Cahn electrobalance model 25. Our results for Zr1-_x_Ni_x_ (168-190 _m_O cm) are in reasonable agreement with those of Babic _et al._67 (164-182 _m_O cm) on a similar amorphous Zr1-_x_Ni_x_ series, and lower than the ~320 _m_O cm (_x_ = 0.24,0.36) upper limits reported by Buschow and Beekmans.68 For Zr1-_x_Co_x_ our values (170-181 _m_O cm) can be compared only with isolated single-alloy measurements: 145 _m_O cm (_x_ = 0.3)24 and 190 _m_O cm (_x_ = 0.3).69

Resistivity ratios \(r\) = \(r_{a}\)(4.2 K) /_r_(300 K) (Table 1, column 8) are not subject to the geometric error. We previously reported57 good agreement for \(r\) on Allied Corporation Metglas(r) Fe-base amorphous alloys measured by Rayne and Levy70 and ourselves.57 However, for nonferromagnetic or nonantiferromag   netic high-\(\rho_{n}\) crystalline [71] and amorphous [24, 72] alloys, fluctuation and/or remnant superconductivity usually combine with the normal-state negative-temperature coefficient of resistivity to produce a peak in \(\rho(T,H=0)\) at about \(2T_{c}\). [73, 74] For the higher-\(T_{c}\) alloys of the present study, we found it necessary to apply high magnetic fields at 4.2 K so as to quench above-\(T_{c}\) superconductivity and thus allow measurement of the normal state \(\rho_{n}\)(4.2 K). Because these complications are either ignored or treated differently by other workers, it is currently difficult to make meaningful \(r\) comparisons on superconducting amorphous alloys measured in different laboratories. The present resistivity ratios (Table 1, column 8) \(r=1.040-1.082\) imply _average_ temperature coefficients of resistivity over the range \(\Delta T=300-4\) K of

\[\langle\,\alpha\,\rangle \equiv \rho^{-1}(\Delta\rho/\Delta T)\approx 0.06(300\,\,{\rm K})^{-1}\] \[= -2\times 10^{-4}\,\,{\rm K}^{-1}\,\,,\]

of somewhat larger magnitude than the high temperature

\[\alpha(300-350\,\,{\rm K})\equiv \rho^{-1}(d\rho/dT)\approx -1\times 10^{-4}\,\,{\rm K}^{-1}\]

read from the \(\alpha\) vs \(\rho_{n}\) graph of Mooij [8] for \(\rho_{n}=180\)\(\mu\Omega\,\)cm (Table 3, column 5). The \(\alpha\) difference is consistent with previous work [36, 75] on high-\(\rho_{n}\) crystalline TM alloys showing that the magnitude of the approximate \(\alpha(2\) K) is larger than the \(\alpha(T\approx 325\) K) values in the Mooij plot at similar \(\rho_{n}\).

## 3 Upper critical fields

### Experimental method

Upper critical fields were measured resistively using the standard dc four-point-contact method. The cryogenic and magnetic systems, as well as the electrical resistivity measuring apparatus and method are similar to those described earlier. [39, 74] Data at applied fields \(H<\sim 25\) kG were normally obtained with a low-residual-field (\(<\sim 10\) G) 30-kG Nb-Zr-wire superconducting solenoid [39]; while data at \(H>\sim 10\) kG were obtained with a 140-kG Nb\({}_{3}\)Sn-tape superconducting solenoid. [74] Field homogeneity of both magnets was better than \(\pm 0.1\)% over the specimen volumes. Electrical resistance measurements were made using separate probes for two orientations (see Fig. 3 inset): (1) the current density \(\overline{\bf J}\) (and the long axis of the specimen) parallel to \(\overline{\bf H}\), and (2) the current density \(\overline{\bf J}\) (and the long axis of the specimen) perpendicular to \(\overline{\bf H}\). In the latter orientation the specimen was held so that its wide flat surface was perpendicular to \(\overline{\bf H}\). Copper potential leads and indium-coated copper current contacts were held firmly and nondestructively against the thin-strip specimens by beryllium-copper-strip springs. Specimens were immersed directly in a liquid-helium bath contained by a stainless-steel Janis insert Dewar. Temperatures down to 1.1 K could be obtained by pumping over the helium bath.

For the critical-field measurements, temperatures were held constant to within \(\pm 0.001\) K and were determined with an absolute accuracy of about \(\pm 1\)% by measurement of the helium vapor pressure. Resistive voltages were recorded on the \(y\) axis of an \(xy\) recorder whose \(x\) axis was driven by a voltage nearly proportional to the applied magnetic field.

### Resistive upper-critical-field transitions

Figures 3\(-\)5 show typical normalized resistance versus longitudinal (\(\overline{\bf J}\,|\,|\overline{\bf H}\)) and perpendicular (\(\overline{\bf J}\,|\,\overline{\bf H}\)) applied field curves, similar in some respects to those reported [39, 74, 76, 77, 78] for high-\(\rho_{n}\) crystalline TM alloys using similar apparatus and techniques. Figure 3 shows how \(H_{e2}\) is arbitrarily defined (as in previous work [28, 39]) as the intersection of the steep linear portion of the \(\overline{\bf H}\,|\,|\overline{\bf J}=3\)\({\bf A}/{\rm cm}^{2}\) curves with the \(R=0\) axis. The definition of \(H_{e2}\) as

The curves at \(T=1.5\) and 2.9 K show how the upper critical fields \(H_{e2}(T)\) and the transition widths \(\Delta H\,(T)\) are defined as discussed in the text. The arrows on the curves indicate the directions of the field sweeps. The inset at the right shows the geometrical relationships for the \(\overline{\bf J}\,|\,|\overline{\bf H}\) orientation. (\(V_{R}\) is the resistive voltage proportional to \(R\).) For the \(\overline{\bf J}\,|\,\overline{\bf H}\) orientation (Figs. 4 and 5) \(\overline{\bf H}\) is perpendicular to both \(\overline{\bf J}\) and the wide flat surface of the specimen.

  the transition midpoint at \(J\) = 3 A/cm2 would have negligible effect [28] on the shapes of the \(H_{c2}(T)\) (Figs. 7-9) or \(h^{\bullet}(t)\) (Figs. 11\(-\)16) curves. Several features of the \(\overline{\rm J}\,||\overline{\rm H}\) curves are notable:

(1) The current-density (_J_ ) dependence at \(0.03\leq J\leq 3\) A/cm2 (usually indicative of filamentary or surface superconductivity [39, 76, 77, 78]) is negligible. This contrasts with high-\(\rho_{n}\) crystalline alloys [39] in which surface superconductivity atypical of the bulk (not the ideal Saint-James-de Gennes sheath [79]) often produces _J_-dependent transitions above \(H_{c2}\). Specimen heating evidently accounts for the elevation and instability of the \(J\) = 30 A/cm2 traces apparent in Figs. 3 and 4, since these effects are usually minimal (see Fig. 5) below the liquid-helium _l_-point transition at \(T\) = 2.17 K, where the bath thermal conductance increases drastically.

(2) A long high-field tail appears on the \(R\) /_R__N_ vs \(H\) curves and restoration of full resistance occurs only over a very wide applied field range. For both high-\(\rho_{n}\) crystalline and amorphous alloys, positive slopes in \(R\) /_R__N_ vs \(H\) can be observed [73, 74] (at factors of 100 higher amplification than those of Figs. 3\(-\)5) up to about twice the zero-temperature upper critical field \(H_{c2}(T=0)\) and have been associated [71, 74, 78, 80] with fluctuation superconductivity.

(3) The _slope_ of the \(R\) /_R__N_ vs \(H\) curves in the relatively steep and nearly linear transition region decreases as temperature decreases below \(T_{c}\). Figure 6

Figure 4: Resistive transitions for amorphous Zr0.70Ni0.30 no. 2 as discussed in the text. The curve for \(T\) = 2.2 K and \(\overline{\rm H}\,\overline{\rm J}=\)0.3 A/cm2 shows that the critical mixed-state depinning current density is \(J_{e}\) = 0.3 A/cm2 at \(H\) = 12 kG as discussed in the text.

Figure 5: Resistive transitions for amorphous Zr0.65Co0.38 no. 1 as discussed in the text.

  shows the transition breadth \(\Delta H(T)\), defined as shown in Fig. 3, plotted versus reduced temperature \(t\) \(\equiv\) \(T\)/\(T_{c}\) for Zr\({}_{1-x}\)Co\({}_{x}\) alloys and for several (Zr\({}_{1-x}\)Nb\({}_{x}\))\({}_{0.78}\)Ni\({}_{0.22}\) alloys with exceptionally wide transitions as discussed below. The zero-\(H\) transition breadths at \(T_{c}\),\(\Delta T\)(\(T_{c}\)) are obtained by extrapolating \(\Delta H(T)\) curves to \(T_{c}\), as shown in Fig. 6, so as to obtain \(\Delta H(T_{c})\). One then obtains

\[\Delta T(T_{c}) = \frac{\Delta H(T_{c})}{(-dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}}}\ ,\]

where \((dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}}\) is the measured upper-critical-field slope (Table III, column 3). These _resistive_ transition breadths \(\Delta T(T_{c}) = 4-140\) mK (Table I, column 9), possibly less meaningful than _calorimetric_ widths,[29, 81] are presumably related to superconductive fluctuations and to the ratio of the inhomogeneity scale to the coherence length \(\xi_{G0}\). The widths may be compared with those reported for amorphous alloys by other workers: 5 mK in Zr\({}_{0.75}\)Ni\({}_{0.25}\),[31] less than 20 mK (one specimen at 40 mK) in Zr\({}_{1-x}\)Ni\({}_{x}\),[67] less than 20 mK in Zr\({}_{1-x}\)Cu\({}_{x}\),[29] 10--150 mK in Zr\({}_{1-x}\)Co\({}_{x}\),[55] less than 50 mK in Zr\({}_{0.7}\) (\(T_{L}\))\({}_{0.3}\) (\(T_{L}\) = Cu, Ni, Co),[24] 80 mK in sputtered Nb\({}_{0.75}\)Sn\({}_{0.25}\),[82] less than 200 mK to greater than 1 K in Nb- and Ta-based alloys.[18] Unfortunately, these comparisons must be treated with reservation because the transition-width criteria vary somewhat and the \(J\) dependence, if any, is seldom reported.

Figures 4 and 5 compare typical resistive curves for the \(\bar{\bf J}\) \(||\bar{\bf H}\) and \(\bar{\bf J}\) \(\bar{\bf H}\) orientations. Noteworthy features of the \(\bar{\bf J}\) \(\bar{\bf J}\) \(\bar{\bf H}\) curves are the following:

(1) Above the steep resistive onset near \(H_{c2}\) there is negligible current-density \(J\) dependence for \(0.03\leq\)\(J\) \(\leq\) 3 A/cm\({}^{2}\).

(2) A long high-field tail appears on the \(R\) /\(R_{N}\) vs \(H\) curves and restoration of full resistance occurs only over a very wide applied field range, as is the case in high-\(\rho_{n}\) crystalline alloys.[39, 71, 74, 78] Here as for \(\bar{\bf J}\) \(||\bar{\bf H}\), the long tail has been attributed to fluctuation superconductivity.[71, 74, 78, 80]

(3) The _slope_ of the \(R\) /\(R_{N}\) vs \(H\) curves in the relatively steep and nearly linear transition region shows little temperature dependence, in contrast to the \(\bar{\bf J}\) \(||\bar{\bf H}\) case. This leads to a marked anisotropy in the low-\(T\) transition curves as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Transitions near \(H_{c2}\) for \(\bar{\bf J}\) \(||\bar{\bf H}\) are broader than those for \(\bar{\bf J}\) \(\bar{\bf J}\) \(\bar{\bf H}\). In the transition regions the curves of Figs. 4 and 5 are very similar to those reported[83] for crystalline high-\(\rho_{n}\) Ti\({}_{0.84}\)Mo\({}_{0.16}\), and ascribed to effective one dimensionality in the fluctuation spectrum for the \(\bar{\bf J}\) \(||\bar{\bf H}\) (but not \(\bar{\bf J}\) \(\bar{\bf J}\)) case as indicated by theory.[84] Effective \(H\)-induced one dimensionality of fluctuation superconductivity in high-\(\rho_{n}\) crystalline alloys is also suggested by calorimetric measurements.[81]

(4) The steep resistive onset for \(\bar{\bf J}\) \(\bar{\bf H}\) occurs somewhat below \(H_{c2}\) as defined above (and shown in Fig. 3) by the \(\bar{\bf H}\) \(||\bar{\bf J} = 3\) A/cm\({}^{2}\) transition. Similar behavior occurs in high-\(\rho_{n}\) crystalline TM superconductors.[83] Comparisons of \(H_{c2}(T)\) and \(h^{\bullet}(t)\) as determined from \(\bar{\bf H}\) \(||\bar{\bf J} = 3\) A/cm\({}^{2}\) and \(\bar{\bf H}\) \(\bar{\bf J}\) = 3 A/cm\({}^{2}\) for Zr\({}_{0.62}\)Co\({}_{0.38}\) are shown in Figs. 7 and 13, where the differences are seen to be rather small.

(5) Below the steep resistive onset there is a marked \(J\) dependence of the \(R\) /\(R_{N}\) vs \(H\) curves, which reflects flux-pinning and flux-flow characteristics of the mixed state. Figure 4 shows that flux depinning in Zr\({}_{0.7}\)Ni\({}_{0.3}\) occurs at extremely low critical supercurrent density \(J_{c}\), for example, \(J_{c}\) = 0.3 A/cm\({}^{2}\) at \(H\) = 12 kG (\(h\) \(\equiv\) \(H\) /\(H_{c2}\) = 0.52) and \(T\) = 2.2 K (\(t\) \(\equiv\) \(T\) /\(T_{c}\) = 0.73). This implies a bulk critical pinning force per unit volume[85]\(f_{c}\) = \(J_{c}B\) = 0.36 x 10\({}^{4}\) N/m\({}^{3}\). Table IV compares critical volume pinning forces \(f_{c}\) at similar reduced magnetic fields \(h\) and temperatures \(t\) for various low-pinning superconductors reported in the literature. The presently measured \(f_{c}\) for as quenched Zr\({}_{0.7}\)Ni\({}_{0.3}\) appears to be somewhat greater than those measured in granular aluminum films[86]\({}^{-}\)[88] at rather low \(H\), comparable to that measured in Zr\({}_{0.85}\)Si\({}_{0.15}\),[89] and less than those measured in annealed crystalline alloys[83, 90]\({}^{-}\) and other amorphous metals.[82, 91, 92] Work is in progress[93] to study \(f_{c}\) as a function of annealing[94] and fabrication procedures. One expects low \(f_{c}\) in materials which are homogeneous on a scale of the coherence distance \(\xi_{G}(T)\), as might be expected in some amorphous alloys, especially those displaying "well-behaved" upper critical fields \(H_{c2}(T)\).[27] Interest in such "soft"89 type-II amorphous superconductors with low-\(f_{p}\) and large zero-temperature Ginzburg-Landau penetration depth (\(\lambda_{G0}\)\(\approx\) 7000\(-\)10 000 \(\AA\) for the present alloys as estimated by standard formulas[39]) parallels that in soft amorphous ferromagnets.[1, 7] Attention to soft superconductors centers on gaining greater insight into vortex pinning,[82] unbinding,[95] and flow,[96] and in their use for quantum devices.[1, 97]

(6) Figure 5 shows the well-known[98] "dip effect" in mixed state \(R\) (\(H\)), occurring here at \(J\) = 3 A/cm\({}^{2}\). A vestigal dip effect is also apparent in Fig. 4 at \(J\) = 0.3 A/cm\({}^{2}\), \(T\) = 2.2 K. The dip effect is a flux-flow reflection of the more commonly discussed[99] (but not well understood) "peak effect" in \(J_{c}\) vs \(H\) and in magnetization \(M\) vs \(H\).[39]

### Temperature dependence of upper critical fields \(H_{c2}(T)\)--qualitative

Figures 7-10 show upper critical curves \(H_{c2}(T)\) constructed from resistive data for \(\bar{\bf H}\) \(||\bar{\bf J} = 3\) A/cm

 (such as that of Figs. 3-5) for all specimens. The curves drawn through the data points are approximate best fits as determined visually. The "error bars" on some data points in Figs. 8-10 indicate the discrepancy in \(H_{\epsilon 2}\) as determined in separate runs with the 30- and 140-kG magnets. In the region of overlap (\(\sim\)10-25 kG), discrepancies for other points were less than the diameters of the closed-circle data points. The superconducting transition temperatures \(T_{\epsilon}\) (Table III, column 2) are determined by extrapolating the \(H_{\epsilon 2}(T)\) vs \(T\) curves to zero \(H\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c}  & **Material** & **Form** & **Preparation** & **(A/cm2)** & **\(H\)b** & \(f_{\epsilon}\)c & & & \\  & (1) & (2) & (3) & (4) & (5) & (6) & (7) & (8) & **Ref.** \\ Al & granular & evaporated & \(<5\times 10^{-3}\) & 1.0 & \(<5\times 10^{-4}\) & \(\sim 0.01\) & 0.745 & 87 \\ Al & granular & evaporated & 210 & 0.011 & 0.23 & 0.053 & 0.75 & 88 \\ Zr0.70Ni0.30 & amorphous &  The \(H_{\epsilon 2}(T)\) curves of Figs. 7\(-\)10 are qualitatively alike: linear in \(T\) at low fields near \(T_{\epsilon}\), but with negative curvature in \(T\) at higher fields below \(T_{\epsilon}\). In the latter respect they are similar to \(H_{\epsilon 2}(T)\) measured for dirty TM _crystalline_ superconductors [37]\(-\)[39] and for amorphous TM superconductors reported by Togano and Tachikawa, [20] Kastner _et al._, [26] Carter _et al._, [27] ourselves [28], and more recently by Samwer and Lohneysen, [29] Eschner and Gey, [30] and Poon _et al._[31] As previously indicated, the negative curvature at higher \(H\) below \(T_{\epsilon}\) contrasts sharply with anomalous \(H_{\epsilon 2}(T)\) that is nearly linear in \(T\) down to \(T/T_{\epsilon}<\,\sim\,0.5\) (TL) observed [23] in metallic glasses (a) based on Mo and stabilized by metalloids, [23, 25] and

  (b) of the present Zr-\(T_{L}\) type.[24]

The limiting slopes \(\left(dH_{\epsilon 2}/dT\right)_{T_{\epsilon}}\) (Table 3, column 3) are not much affected by alloy concentration \(x\) for the ZrCo (33\(-\)35 kG/K) and ZrNi (30\(-\)33 kG/K) series. The slopes are in fair agreement with those reported[24] for two specimens which displayed anomalous TL: Zr0.70Co0.30, 33 kG/K; Zr0.70Ni0.30, 31 kG/K. For the two pseudo-binary systems \(\left(Zr_{1-x}Ti_{x}\right)_{0.78}Ni_{0.22}\) and \(\left(Zr_{1-x}Nb_{x}\right)_{0.78}Ni_{0.22}\), \(\left(dH_{\epsilon 2}/dT\right)_{T_{\epsilon}}\) increases with increasing Ti concentration but decreases with increasing Nb concentration.

### Comparison of H\({}_{\epsilon 2}\)(\(T\)) with theory

Figures 11\(-\)17 compare upper critical fields[100] for some of the specimens with the predictions of the WHHM theory.[21, 22] The conditions for applicability of the WHHM theory are as follows: (a) the dirty limit \(\xi_{0}/l\!>>\!1\) (Table 3, column 16), where

Figure 16: Reduced upper critical field \(h^{\bullet}\) vs reduced temperature \(t\) for amorphous \(\left(Zr_{0.93}Nb_{0.05}\right)_{0.78}Ni_{0.22}\) and \(\left(Zr_{0.9}Nb_{0.1}\right)_{0.78}Ni_{0.22}\).

  \(\xi_{0}\!=\!0.18\#\!\nu_{f}(k_{B}T_{c})^{-1}\) is the BCS coherence distance and \(l\) (Table 3, column 15) is the electron mean free path, (b) large ratio \(\tau_{\rm so}/\tau_{\rm tr}\) (Table 3, column 14) of spin-orbit-coupling induced electron-spin-flip scattering time \(\tau_{\rm so}\) (Table 3, column 12) to transport scattering time \(\tau_{\rm tr}\) (Table 3, column 13), (c) BCS weak[101] coupling (half-energy gap \(\sim\!1.76k_{B}T_{c}\), electron-phonon interaction parameter[102]\(\lambda_{\rm e\!-\!ph}\)\(<\!\sim\!1\)), see Sec. IV, (d) specimen spatial homogeniety[27] down to a scale \(\xi_{G0}\) (Table 3, column 10), (e) electronic structure isotropy (as expected in high-\(\rho_{n}\) crystalline and amorphous alloys), (f) effective three dimensionality (effective specimen dimensions \(d>\!\geq\!\xi_{G0}\)).

Figures 11\(-\)17 show \(H_{\epsilon 2}(T)\) vs \(T\) data plotted in terms of reduced field \(h^{\bullet}(t)\equiv\!H_{\epsilon 2}(T)/-[dH_{\epsilon 2}(t)/dt]_{t = 1}\) versus reduced temperature \(t\!\equiv\!T/T_{c}\). The Maki[22] paramagnetic limitation parameter \(\alpha\) (Table 3, column 4) is experimentally determined from the measured slope \((-dH_{\epsilon 2}/dT)_{T}\), and the spin-orbit scattering parameter[21, 103]\(\lambda_{\rm so}\!\equiv\!2\#(3\pi k_{B}T_{c}\tau_{\rm so})^{-1}\) (Table 3, column 11) is treated as a fitting parameter.

A notable feature of Figs. 11\(-\)16 (and of similar figures[42] not shown here for the other specimens) is the fair agreement with WHHM theory:

(1) Experimental \(h^{\bullet}(t)\) data points lie reasonably close to the theoretical \(h^{\bullet}(\alpha,\lambda_{\rm so},t)\) curves for \(2\!\leq\!\lambda_{\rm so}\!\leq\!6\) values (Table 3, column 11) which are physically reasonable, i.e., they imply spin-orbit-coupling induced spin-flip scattering times \(\tau_{\rm so}\) much longer than the ordinary transport scattering times \(\tau_{\rm tr}\) (a condition also required for applicability of the WHHM[21, 22] theory). By excluding the last two alloys of Table 3, estimated \(\tau_{\rm so}/\tau_{\rm tr}\) ratios (Table 3, column 14) are in the range 100\(-\)600.

(2) As reduced temperature \(t\) decreases, the \(h^{\bullet}(t)\) data points fall near theoretical \(h^{\bullet}(t)\) curves characterized by lower \(\lambda_{\rm so}\) than the theoretical curves which describe the higher-\(t\) data. This same type of discrepancy between experiment and WHHM theory has been previously noted[39] for high-\(\rho_{n}\) crystalline TM alloys.

More striking deviations between experiment and WHHM theory have been reported by Orlando _et al.[104]_ for Nb\({}_{3}\)Sn specimens where a nonphysical \(\tau_{\rm so}/\tau_{\rm tr}\!<\!1\) is required to fit the data. These workers have suggested that neglect of proper many-body renormalization may cause the theory to yield unrealistically low values of \(\tau_{\rm so}\) (i.e., unrealistically high values of \(\lambda_{\rm so}\) when \(\lambda_{\rm so}\) is regarded as a fitting parameter to experimental data).

Aside from the present and our past[28] measurements, the only relatively low-\(\lambda_{\rm so}\) fits of amorphous alloy \(H_{\epsilon 2}(T)\) data to WHHM theory appear to be those for Zr\({}_{0.77}\)Rh\({}_{0.23}\) (\(\lambda_{\rm so}\!=\!8\)),[20] various ZrRh and ZrPd alloys \((1.8\!\leq\!\lambda_{\rm so}\!\leq\!3.7)\),[30]\(\mbox{Zr}_{0.75}\)Ni\({}_{0.25}\) (\(\lambda_{\rm so}\!=\!2\)),[31] and Zr\({}_{0.75}\)Rh\({}_{0.25}\) (\(\lambda_{\rm so}\!=\!2\)).[31] High-\(\lambda_{\rm so}\) fits to WHHM have been reported for vapor quenched Mo\({}_{0.6}\)Ru\({}_{0.4}\) (\(\lambda_{\rm so}\!=\!\infty\)),[27]\(\mbox{Mo}_{0.52}\)Ge\({}_{0.48}\) (\(\lambda_{\rm so}\!=\!\infty\)),[27] sputtered Mo\({}_{0.45}\)Si\({}_{0.25}\) [\(H_{\epsilon 2}(T\!=\!0)\) exceeds the \(\lambda_{\rm so}\!=\!\infty\) prediction by 15%],[105] and sputtered La\({}_{0.78}\)Zn\({}_{0.22}\) (\(\lambda_{\rm so}\!=\!\infty\) but apparently in the non-WHHM strong coupling regime).[106] It is possible that strong coupling corrections,[107] extensions of WHHM to the low-\(\tau_{\rm so}/\tau_{\rm tr}\) regime,[108] or renormalization[104] would yield lower \(\lambda_{\rm so}\) values such that \(\tau_{\rm so}/\tau_{\rm tr}\!>\!1\) for the above high-\(\lambda_{\rm so}\) cases.

Another possibility is that high-\(\lambda_{\rm so}\) fits to WHHM may reflect some degree of alloy inhomogeneity. Figure 17 shows relatively high-\(\lambda_{\rm so}\) fits for \((\mbox{Zr}_{1-x}\mbox{Nb}_{x})_{0.78}\)Nb\({}_{0.22}\) with \(x\!=\!0.15\),0.20. Although there is no apparent evidence of alloy inhomogeneity in these specimens in x-ray, density, or normal-state electrical resistivity measurements, other _superconductive_ evidence suggests inhomogeneity:

(1) Figure 18 shows that for \(x\!=\!0.2\) the resistive transitions for \(\vec{\rm H}||\vec{\rm J}\) depend upon the current density \(J\) (similar but less pronounced dependence occurs for \(x\!=\!0.15\)). If \(H_{\epsilon 2}\) is defined by the \(\vec{\rm H}||\vec{\rm J}\!=\!0.3\) A/cm\({}^{2}\) curves, then Fig. 17 shows that \(H_{\epsilon 2}(T)\) lies close to the WHHM theory curve for \(\lambda_{\rm so}\!=\!\infty\).

(2) Figures 6 and 18 show that the upper-critical-field transition breadths \(\Delta H(T)\) are unusually large for these specimens. Extrapolation of \(\Delta H(T)\) to

Figure 17: Reduced upper critical field \(h^{\bullet}\) vs reduced temperature \(t\) for amorphous \((\mbox{Zr}_{0.85}\mbox{Nb}_{0.15})_{0.78}\)Ni\({}_{0.22}\) and \((\mbox{Zr}_{0.8}\mbox{Nb}_{0.2})_{0.78}\)Ni\({}_{0.22}\). For these two specimens the upper-critical-field resistive transitions are dependent on the current density \(J\) (see also Fig. 18).

  and application of Eq. (1) then yields relatively large zero-\(H\) breadths \(\Delta T(T_{c}) = 74\) and 140 mK (Table 1, column 9) for these specimens.

(3) Figure 18 shows a high-\(H\), \(J\)-dependent "peak effect" (not to be confused with the peak effect [99] discussed above in connection with Fig. 5) measured at \(T = 3.0\), 2.8, and 1.1 K. The peak effect was absent in the (Zr0.85Nb0.15)0.78Ni0.22 specimen but has been observed in a poorly melt-spun Zr0.79Co0.21 specimen. The peak effect could be caused by high-\(T_{c}\) crystalline or amorphous inclusions.

## IV Electronic specific-heat coefficients

The electronic specific-heat coefficients \(\gamma_{\nu}\) (per unit volume) (Table 3, column 6) are calculated from the limiting upper-critical-field slope in accordance with the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-Ginzburg-Landau-Abrikosov-Gor'kov relationship [109]

\[\gamma_{\nu} = \frac{k_{B}\pi^{3}}{12ec}\frac{1}{\rho_{n}}\left[\frac{-dH_{e2}} {dT}\right]_{T_{c}}\ ,\]

where in useful units [39]\(k_{B}\pi^{3}(12ec)^{- 1} = 2.268 \times 10^{4}\) erg (\(\mu\Omega\) cm) cm-3 K-1 kG-1, Eq. (2) is applicable in the weak coupling dirty-limit regime. A recent survey [18] comparing \(\gamma_{\nu}\) values as calculated from Eq. (2) with calorimetric determinations shows generally good agreement of the two methods, as was also discussed in Ref. 28. The applicability of Eq. (2) is of special physical significance for TM, since it suggests that the same [presumably hybridized (_sp_)-\(d\)] electrons which contribute to the zero-\(H\) superconducting transition specific-heat jump \(\Delta C \approx 1.4\gamma T_{c}\) also determine the normal-state resistivity \(\rho_{n}\).

The electronic specific-heat coefficients \(\gamma_{m}\) (per mole) (Table 3, column 7) are obtained from \(\gamma_{\nu}\) and the density-determined atomic volumes \(V_{0}\) (Table 1, column 11). The "dressed," one-spin-state densities of the Fermi level \(N_{\gamma}\) (Table 3, column 8) are then given by

\[N_{\gamma} = (1 + \lambda_{e \cdot \text{ph}} + \lambda_{\text{es}} )N_{b} = (\frac{2}{3}\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2})^{- 1}\gamma_{m}\ ,\]

where, in useful units, [39]\((\frac{2}{3}\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2})^{- 1} = 0.212\) single-spin states eV-1 atom-1 mJ-1 (mol K2), the \(\lambda\)'s are many-body interaction parameters (not to be confused with \(\lambda_{\text{so}}\)) with subscripts _e_-ph, the electron-phonon, and es, the electron-spin fluctuations, [104] and \(N_{b}\) is the "bare" or "band" density of states at the Fermi level.

Figures 19 and 20 show the molar specific-heat coefficients \(\gamma_{m}\) versus concentration \(x\) for the Zr1-\(x\)Co_x_ and Zr1-\(x\)Ni_x_ systems. For both systems \(\gamma_{m}\) appears to decrease with alloy concentration \(x\) although the large (\(\pm 10\)%) error bars (reflecting primarily the geometric uncertainty in \(\rho_{n}\) values) preclude any quantitative confidence in the \(\gamma_{m}\) vs \(x\) slope. A rather similar decrease in \(\gamma_{m}(x)\) has recently been reported in other Zr1-\(x\)(\(T_{L}\))x alloys where \(T_{L} = \)Cu, [29] Rh, [30] and Pd. [30]

For the two pseudobinary systems (Zr1-\(x\)Nbx)0.78Ni0.22 and (Zr1-\(x\)Ti_x)0.78Ni0.22, the \(\gamma_{m}\) values (Table 3, column 7) show variation which is small in comparison with the experimental uncertainty, and calorimetric measurements would be useful. Figure 19 shows a rather large (30%) discrepancy of our interpolated \(\gamma_{m}\) value for Zr0.70Co0.30 with that determined from \(\rho_{n}\) and (\(dH_{e2}/dT\))\({}_{T_{c}}\) by Tenhover and Johnson. [24] This disagreement arises primarily because the latter measure (with no uncertainty specification) a value \(\rho_{n} = 145\)\(\mu\Omega\) cm, much lower than present values for ZrCo (Table 3, column 5). Figure 20 shows that present \(\gamma_{m}\) values for Zr1-\(x\)Ni_x_ are in good agreement with those of Tenhover and Johnson [24] [from \(\rho_{n}\) and (\(dH_{e2}/dT\))\({}_{T_{c}}\)] and Moody and Ng [110] (from calorimetry), but in marked disagreement (30%) with calorimetric data of Ravex _et al._[111] on sput

  tered and annealed Zr0.76Ni0.24.

  \(N_{b}\) (Zr1-_x_Cu_x) = 0.48-0.56, somewhat above \(N_{b}\)(_c_Zr) and contrary to the UPS interpretation.112 If we assume that for all amorphous Zr1-_x_Co_x and Zr1-_x_Ni_x alloys, _l_e-ph 0.6 [near those estimated for Zr0.64Ni0.36,110 Zr1-_x_Cu_x_,29 and Zr0.7Pd0.3 (Ref. 4)] and use Eq. (3) with _l_es = 0 to obtain _Nb_, then _Nb_ (Zr1-_x_Co_x) = 0.64-0.77 and _Nb_ (Zr1-_x_Ni_x) = 0.53-0.62. The UPS indicated114 band-merging effect as one replaces Cu by Ni and Co could account for the apparent increase in _Nb_ for ZrCo and ZrNi over that in ZrCu, as previously suggested by Tenhover and Johnson,24 but calorimetric and tunneling data would be useful in assessing this possibility.

In any event, the presently observed TM-like high \(g_{m}\) values, as well as those reported for other Zr1-_x_(\(T_{L}\))_x_ alloys where \(T_{L}\) = Cu,29 Rh,30 and Pd (Refs. 4 and 30) are not easily explained on the basis of nearly-free-electron models sometimes applied in liquid and amorphous alloy treatments of electron-transport117 and structural stability.118 The \(g_{m}\) values calculated from Eq. (2), along with measured \(r_{m}\) values have been used to calculate the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) extrinsic \(k_{l}\) = 76-92 (Table III, column 9), and the GL zero-temperature coherence distance _g__G_0 = 50-70 A (Table III, column 10). In order to estimate the transport scattering time \(t_{r}\) we have arbitrarily and rather nonphysically assumed (as previously39 in treating high-_r__m_ crystalline TM alloys) an effective conduction-electron density \(n\) = (_e/a_)_V_0-1 and that _S/S__f_ (the ratio of free Fermi surface area \(S\) to that of a free-electron gas of density _n_) is 0.6. The values for \(t_{r}\), _t__so_/_t__tr_, the electron mean free path \(l\), and the dirtiness parameter \(x\)0/_l_ in Table III, columns 13-16 then follow from standard formulas39 as indicated in the Table III footnotes. If we assume, on the other hand, a free-electron-like Fermi surface _S/S__f_ = 1, and \(n\) = (_e/a_)_V_0-1, but with _e/a_ = 3,2,2,0 for Nb, _Zr_, Ti, and \(T_{L}\) (\(T_{L}\) = Ni,Co), respectively, then the combined \(n\) decrease and _S/S__f_ increase multiply the \(t_{r}\) values (Table III, column 13) by factors of 1.7-3.4, the _t__so_/_t__tr_ values (Table III, column 14) by 0.6-0.3, the \(l\) values (Table III, column 15) by 1.3-1.8, and the \(x\)0/_l_ values (Table III, column 16) by 0.6-0.3. Thus the order of magnitude of \(t_{r}\) and _t__tr_-dependent parameters (Table III, columns 13-16) does not appear to depend critically on assumptions regarding the effective conduction-electron density or Fermi-surface ratios.

The very high \(x\)0/_l_ = 300-1300 values (Table III, column 16) indicate that the present amorphous alloys are among the dirtiest superconductors ever examined and perhaps approach Pippard's119 hundred percent dirty superconductor: "As you go on adding impurity, and physical strain, and defects, and this, that, and the other sort of filth to superconductors ... is there any limit to which you can reasonably expect to attain? That is to say, is there such a thing as a hundred percent dirty superconductor, and if we do make a hundred percent dirty superconductor will it have properties as ideal as one that is a hundred percent pure?" Some near-ideal properties of the present specimens are summarized in Sec. VI below.

## V Superconducting transition temperatures

Figures 19-21 show the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) (Table III, column 2) versus alloy concentration for the four amorphous alloy series. Figures 19 and 20 show that for Zr1-_x_Co_x_ and Zr1-_x_Ni_x_ alloys, \(T_{c}\) decreases linearly with \(x\) with slopes _dT__c_/_dx_ = - 9.7 and -7.3 K/atomic fraction, respectively. These slopes may be compared with those reported for ZrCo (- 12) (Ref. 56) and ZrNi (- 6.3) (Ref. 67) (in the same units). As indicated above, for these series the molar electronic specific-heat coefficient \(g_{m}\) also appears to decrease in _x_ough parallel with \(T_{c}\) as shown in the same fig

Figure 21: Superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) vs concentration for Zr in amorphous (Zr1-_x_Ti_x_0.78Ni0.22 and amorphous (Zr1-_x_Nb_x_0.78Ni0.22 (top right). For comparison the \(T_{c}\) variation of other amorphous Zr-based alloys is also shown: ZrCu (■) and ZrFe (■), Ref. 120; ZrFe (■), Ref. 6; ▲, Ref. 56; ▲, Ref. 28; ▲’, Refs. 24 and 121; \(V\) (○), Ref. 24; Co (•) and Ni (■) present work; Cu (■), Ref. 29; Pd (●), Ref. 122; Rh (●), Ref. 30. The vertical arrows on the two lowest ZrFe points mean that the _T__c_’s are below 1.2 K.

  ures. Figure 21 shows that in the pseudobinary systems (Zr1-_x_Tix0.78Ni0.22 and (Zr1-_x_Nbx0.78Ni0.22, _T_c decreases with Ti concentration, whereas _T_c first increases and then decreases with Nb concentration. As indicated previously, for both these systems the \(g_{m}\) variation is considerably less than the experimental uncertainty in \(g_{m}\) of +-10%.

Figures 22 and 23 show \(T_{c}\) versus the average "valence" electron-to-atom ratio (_e/a_) for amorphous ZrNi and ZrCo alloys. Here (_e/a_) is the conventional "Matthias-count"124 average number of electrons outside closed shells of the free atom. Figure 22 shows that the present \(T_{c}\) values for Zr1-_x_Co_x are as much as 12% lower than those of other investigators,24,55,69 possibly due to our use of relatively low purity Co (Table II, column 4). On the other hand, Fig. 23 indicates reasonably good agreement of present \(T_{c}\) values for Zr1-_x_Ni_x with those reported by most others.24,69,69,94,110,111,123

Figure 24 shows \(T_{c}\) vs (_e/a_) for the two pseudobinary systems. For comparison the presently indicated curves for \(T_{c}\) vs (_e/a_) for amorphous ZrCo and ZrNi are also shown. The decrease in \(T_{c}\) with Ti concentration in (Zr1-_x_Tix0.78Ni0.22 is opposite to the behavior of crystalline hcp Zr1-_x_Tix alloys, where \(T_{c}\) (and also \(g_{m}\)) increase125 with \(x\) for 0<=_x_<=0.5. The peaking of \(T_{c}\) with increase of (_e/a_), shown by (Zr1-_x_Nbx0.78Ni0.22, has apparently not been previously observed in _T__c__T__L_ alloys _quenched from the melt_, except for a very small effect in recent data30 on low Rh concentration ZrRh alloys (see Figs. 21 and 25). A split-band interpretation of the \(T_{c}\)(_x_) peak in (Zr1-_x_Nbx0.78Ni0.22 might be that the high niobium \(d\) band (unlike the Ni \(d\) band114-116) falls close to the Fermi level, thus elevating \(N_{b}\) and thus \(T_{c}\). Calorimetric and UPS data would, of course, be helpful in elucidating the present pseudobinary alloy behavior.

Figure 25 shows curves of \(T_{c}\) vs (_e/a_) for three classes of TM amorphous alloys:

(1) The top curve shows the well-known CollVermHammond peak9 for 4\(d\) vapor-quenched amorphous alloys between nearest and next-nearest neighbors in the Periodic Table. This curve peaks at (_e/a_) = 6.4, \(T_{c}\) = 9.4. (A similar curve obtains for 5\(d\) near-neighbor vapor-quenched alloys.9,10)

(2) Within the delineated border situated under the Collver-Hammond peak are curves and data points for amorphous Zr_T__L_ alloys, all quenched from the melt except for the ion-implanted low

  \(\langle\)_e/a_\(\rangle\) ZrCu and ZrFe alloys measured by Meyer _et al._[120] and judged[120] to be amorphous partially on the basis of normal-state resistivity data at 4\(-\)300 K. The wide scatter in melt-quenched ZrFe data from different laboratories[6, 24, 28, 56, 121] is evidently associated with difficulties[42, 56, 114] in fabricating these specimens and/or sensitivity of the magnetic condition[24, 43, 56, 127] of Fe to details of the processing. Ignoring the melt-quenched ZrFe curves, the \(T_{c}\) vs \(\langle\)_e/a_\(\rangle\) data for Zr\(T_{L}\) alloys peak roughly at \(\langle\)_e/a_\(\rangle\) =4.8, \(T_{c}\) = 3.8 K (4.4 K for ZrRh).

(3) At \(\langle\)_e/a_\(\rangle\) = 6.8 are various \(T_{\xi}T_{\eta}\) (NbRh, NbIr, TaRh, TaIr) and \(T_{\xi}T_{\eta}\) (NbNi) alloys with \(T_{\epsilon}\) in the range 1.5\(-\)5.2. Here the subscripts indicate the group numbers.

The variety of \(T_{c}\) vs \(\langle\)_e/a_\(\rangle\) behaviors shown in Figs. 22\(-\)25 is consistent with the early suggestion of Collver and Hammond[10] that "there is no universal \(T_{\epsilon}\) vs \(\langle\)_e/a_\(\rangle\) curve for all amorphous TM alloys, as there is a breakdown from such a correlation for alloys composed of TM elements widely separated in the Periodic Table."[10] The UPS indication[112]\(-\)[116] of split-band behavior in amorphous \(T_{\xi}T_{L}\) alloys is also compatible with the idea that the alloying dependence of their superconducting transition temperature cannot be described by \(T_{\epsilon}\) vs \(\langle\)_e/a_\(\rangle\) rules. Such rules[124] often hold for near-neighbor crystalline alloys and probably reflect the alloying dependence of the bare-state density \(N_{b}\) as the Fermi level moves along a _collective d_ band[128]\(-\)[131]. Rapp _et al._[55, 56] have also emphasized the limited applica

For comparison, curves of \(T_{\epsilon}\) vs \(\langle\)_e/a_\(\rangle\) for ZrCo and ZrNi as indicated by the present data (Figs. 22 and 23) are also shown.

The data for Zr-based non-near neighbors are due to the following: ZrCu (\(\nabla\) ) and ZrFe (\(\blacklozenge\)), Ref. 120; ZrFe (\(\blacksquare\)), Ref. 6; \(\blacklozenge\), Ref. 56; \(\blacktriangle\), Ref. 28; \(\bigtriangledown\), Refs. 24 and 121; \(V\) (\(\circ\)), Ref. 24; Co (\(\bullet\)) and Ni (\(\blacksquare\)) present work; Cu (\(\nabla\)), Ref. 29; Pd (\(\blacklozenge\)), Ref. 122; Rh (\(\blacksquare\)), Ref. 30. The vertical arrows on the two lowest ZrFe points mean that the \(T_{\epsilon}\)’s are below 1.2 K. The data for Nb-based alloys are due to the following: NbRh (\(\circ\)), Ref. 18; \(\circ\), Ref. 126; NbIr (\(\triangle\)), Ref. 18; NbNi (\(\blacksquare\)), Ref. 126. The data for Ta-based alloys are due to Ref. 18. In this plot \(e/a\) for Cu has arbitrarily been taken as 11 rather than 1.

  bility of \(T_{\epsilon}\) vs (_e/a_) rules[132] for TM amorphous alloys.

Figure 21 shows \(T_{\epsilon}\) vs Zr concentration for the same amorphous Zr_T\({}_{L}\)_ alloy data plotted in Fig. 25. In addition, as previously discussed, Fig. 21 shows the \(T_{\epsilon}\) variation of the present pseudobinary alloys. Disregarding the latter (as nonrepresentative of Zr-base alloys), as well as the scattered _melt-quenched_ ZrFe data, a somewhat more universal single-peak curve is obtained for Zr-base non-near neighbor alloys than in the corresponding \(T_{\epsilon}\) vs (_e/a_) plot of Fig. 25. This implies that equal atomic concentrations of \(T_{L}\)-atom additions have much the same effect on the \(T_{\epsilon}\) of amorphous Zr regardless of their group number (at high concentrations Fe may be an exception due to magnetic effects[24, 43, 56, 127]).

It is interesting that Rh (a 4\(d\) metal) is "out of line" in Figs. 21 and 25 suggesting a possible influence of 3_d_-atom (and Pd) spin-fluctuation effects on \(T_{\epsilon}\), although susceptibility measurements on amorphous ZrCo (Refs. [56] and [68]) and ZrNi (Refs. [67] and [68]) in the present concentration range show no evidence for moment localization or very high Pauli paramagnetism. Likewise, hcp Zr-based alloys with dilute additions of 3\(d\) elements show magnetic moment localization only for Mn.[133]

\(T_{\epsilon}\) variations such as those of Figs. 21 and 25 are usually discussed in terms of the McMillan equation (4) and his expression for the (single-element) electron-phonon coupling parameter[102]

\[\lambda_{\epsilon\text{-ph}} = \frac{N_{\text{b}}\left( {I^{2}} \right)}{m\left\langle {\omega^{2}} \right\rangle}\text{ ,}\]

where \(\left\langle {I^{2}} \right\rangle\) is the mean-square electron-phonon matrix element, \(m\) is the atomic mass, and \(\left\langle {\omega^{2}} \right\rangle\) is a mean-square phonon frequency.[102] Associated with the fact that little is known about the electronic or vibrational properties of the vapor-quenched 4\(d\) near-neighbor alloys of Collver and Hammond,[9, 10] a variety of different explanations of the Collver-Hammond peak (CHP), all based essentially on Eq. (5), have been offered. Dynes and Varma[134] suggest that CHP is due to the "variation of \(N_{\text{b}}\) with changing electron concentration in a smooth structureless fashion with alloying"; Butler[131] regards CHP as reflecting primarily a triangular variation of \(\left\langle {I^{2}} \right\rangle/\left( {m\left\langle {\omega^{2}} \right\rangle} \right)\) where the \(\left\langle {I^{2}} \right\rangle\) contribution is dominant, consistent with his rigid-muffin-tin calculations for 4\(d\) elements in the cubic crystalline phase; and Bennemann[135] interprets CHP as due primarily to variation in \(\left\langle {I^{2}} \right\rangle\). As previously pointed out by Chaudhari and Turnbull,[1] Bennemann's analysis appears to be partially based on the questionable assumption that the atomic volume increase on melting of a crystalline material is always close to the increase in atomic volume in going from the crystalline to the amorphous solid. On the other hand, data such as the present density measurements would indicate that in \(T_{E}T_{L}\) alloys the amorphous and crystalline phases are about equally close packed with packing fractions \(\eta \approx 0.74\).

Interpretations of \(T_{\epsilon}\) variation in liquid-quenched Zr-based alloys are able to rely on a greater range of experimental information but no satisfactory general description has been achieved. Samwer and Lohneysen's analysis[29] of their calorimetric data[29] on amorphous ZrCu [relying on approximate \(\lambda_{\epsilon\text{-ph}}\) values deduced from Eq. (4)] indicates that the measured 73% drop in \(T_{\epsilon}\) with a Cu addition occurs with a 25% decrease in \(N_{\text{y}}\), but only a 15% decrease in \(N_{\text{b}}\). They attribute the \(T_{\epsilon}\) drop primarily to decrease in \(\left\langle {I^{2}} \right\rangle\) resulting from dilution of Zr-Zr interaction by the addition of \(T_{L}\) atoms, i.e., the average Zr-Zr atom separation increases as \(T_{L}\) atoms are added. On the other hand, Tenhover and Johnson[24] suggest that their measured 20% decrease in \(T_{\epsilon}\) in going from Co to Ni to Cu in the amorphous alloys Zr_T_0.70C00.30, Zr_T_0.70Ni0.30, and Zr_T_0.70Cu0.30 is associated primarily with a concomitant 36% decrease in \(N_{\text{y}}\) as inferred from their \(\rho_{\text{n}}\) and \(\left\langle {dH_{\epsilon^{2}}/dT} \right\rangle_{T_{\epsilon}}\) measurements [which (for \(T_{\epsilon}\) and \(\rho_{\text{n}}\) of Zr_T_0.7C00.3) differ somewhat from the present measurements]. Eschner and Gey[30] conclude [on the basis of calorimetric \(\rho_{\text{n}}\) and \(\left\langle {dH_{\epsilon^{2}}/dT} \right\rangle_{T_{\epsilon}}\) measurements on amorphous ZrRh, ZrPd, and ZrRhPd alloys] that \(N_{\text{b}}\) "has no importance concerning \(T_{\epsilon}\)" and that the McMillan equation (4) is "not applicable to amorphous metals." Clearly, more work appears to be required in this area.

On the basis of the somewhat similar \(\gamma(x)\) behavior of Zr1-xCo\({}_{\text{x}}\) (Fig. 19), Zr1-xNi\({}_{\text{x}}\) (Fig. 20), and Zr1-xCu\({}_{\text{x}}\),[29] one might speculate that the rough congruences of \(T_{\epsilon}\) versus composition data for various Zr-3\(d\) alloys on the broad single-peak curve of Fig. 21 indicates that the Lohneysen-Samwer dilution-effect[29] lowering of \(\left\langle {I^{2}} \right\rangle\) plays the key role in depressing \(T_{\epsilon}\) in the 50-80 at. % Zr range in all cases. The controlling parameter, average Zr-Zr atom separation, would then correspond to the suggested[131] influential 4_d_-atom separation in the near-neighbor CHP case. There, according to Butler,[131]\(\left\langle {I^{2}} \right\rangle\) peaks near Mo, associated in part with a minimum in atomic separation to the right of Mo in the Periodic Table.[136] One expects a similar minimum for amorphous alloys on the basis of tabulated Goldschmidt radii.[45]

## VI Conclusions

The present upper-critical-field data on various amorphous, Zr-based TM alloys are in fair agree  ment with the standard dirty-limit WHHM theory.[21, 22] We do not observe gross departure from WHHM in the form of \(H_{\epsilon 2}(T)\) curves that are nearly linear in \(T\) down to \(T/T_{\epsilon}<\,\sim\,0.5\) as reported by some,[23, 24, 25] nor (with the exception of two specimens) less pronounced deviation from WHHM in the form of \(H_{\epsilon 2}(T)\) curves requiring unphysically high-\(\lambda_{\rm so}\) fits to WHHM as observed by others.[27, 105, 106] Structure integrity of our specimens is indicated by x-ray, density, bend-ductility, normal-state electrical resistivity, superconducting transition width, and mixed-state flux-pinning measurements. \(H_{\epsilon 2}(T)\) curves that are linear in \(T\) down to \(T/T_{\epsilon}<\,\sim\,0.5\) or that indicate high \(\lambda_{\rm so}\) when compared to WHHM may reflect inhomogeneity.[27] Such an interpretation is consistent with present results on two (Zr\({}_{1-x}\)Nb\({}_{x}\))\({}_{0.78}\)Ni\({}_{0.22}\) specimens for which relatively high \(\lambda_{\rm so}\) values derived from WHHM fits are coupled with relatively broad zero-field superconducting transitions, current-density-dependent resistive upper-critical-field transitions, and (in one specimen) a \(J\)-dependent, high \(H>\,H_{\epsilon 2}\) resistive peak effect (Fig. 18).

Estimates of the dirtiness parameter \(\xi_{0}/l\)\(\approx\,300-\)1300 [based on approximate formulas[39] and measured values of \(T_{\epsilon}\), \(\rho_{n}\), and \((dH_{\epsilon 2}/dT)_{T_{\epsilon}}\)] indicate an approach to Pippard's[119] "100% dirty superconductor." Very dirty superconductors tend to display clean properties.[39] The present alloys [ignoring the two apparently inhomogeneous (Zr\({}_{1-x}\)Nb\({}_{x}\))\({}_{0.78}\)Ni\({}_{0.22}\) specimens] display near ideality in several respects: (a) \(H_{\epsilon 2}(T)\) curves in fair accordance with _dirty-limit_**WHHM** theory,[21, 22] (b) relatively sharp resistive transitions at \(T_{\epsilon}\) over \(\Delta T\,(T_{\epsilon})=\,4-50\) mK, (c) sharper \(H_{\epsilon 2}\) transitions for current density \(\overline{\rm J}\,|\overline{\rm H}\) than for \(\overline{\rm J}\,|\overline{\rm H}\), consistent with a one-dimensional fluctuation spectrum for \(\overline{\rm J}\,|\overline{\rm H}\),[84] (d) current-density \(J\) independence of \(H_{\epsilon 2}\) transitions for \(0.03\leq J\leq 3\) A/cm\({}^{2}\), (e) critical flux-depinning forces \(f_{\epsilon}=J_{\epsilon}H\), lower than reported for most other low-pinning crystalline[83, 90] and amorphous[82, 91, 92] superconductors.

\(T_{\epsilon}\) measurements in the amorphous Zr\({}_{1-x}\)Co\({}_{x}\) and Zr\({}_{1-x}\)Ni\({}_{x}\) systems show that \(T_{\epsilon}\) decreases linearly with Co or Ni addition in fair agreement with previous results[24, 55, 67, 69, 94, 110, 111, 123] on these systems. Upper-critical-field and normal-state electrical resistivity measurements suggest concomitant decrease in the molar electronic specific-heat coefficients. In the (Zr\({}_{1-x}\)Ti\({}_{x}\))\({}_{0.78}\)Ni\({}_{0.22}\) and (Zr\({}_{1-x}\)Nb\({}_{x}\))\({}_{0.78}\)Ni\({}_{0.22}\) systems, \(T_{\epsilon}\) decreases with Ti addition, while \(T_{\epsilon}\) first increases and then decreases with Nb addition. The wide variety of \(T_{\epsilon}\) vs (_e/a_) behavior in the present and in other amorphous alloys (Figs. 22\(-\)25) is consistent with the idea[10] (bolstered by recent UPS data[112]\(-\)116 indicating split bands in amorphous TM alloys) that the alloying dependence of \(T_{\epsilon}\) in amorphous superconductors cannot be described by any general \(T_{\epsilon}\) vs (_e/a_) rules such as often apply to near-neighbor crystalline alloys.[124]

Satisfactory understanding of \(T_{\epsilon}\) variations in amorphous TM alloys as shown in Figs. 21 and 25 appears to require more data (e.g., calorimetric, upper critical field, UPS, neutron inelastic scattering, and tunneling) on well-characterized specimens from a wide variety of different amorphous systems. As in the present work, structural characterization may be assisted by superconductive measurements (e.g., transition breadth, current-density dependence of resistive transitions, upper-critical-field temperature dependence, and mixed-state flux pinning).

This formula is equivalent to \(\gamma_{v} = \alpha/(2.35\rho_{n})\) of Ref. 39 with units as specified therein, and may be derived from Abrikosov's \(H_{c2} = \sqrt{2}\kappa H_{c}\), Gor'kov's dirty limit \[\kappa \approx \kappa_{l} = e\gamma_{v}^{1/2}\rho_{n}(k_{B}\pi^{3})^{-1}[21\xi(3)/2\pi]^{1/2}\ ,\] and the weak coupling BCS \[(dH_{c}/dT)_{T_{c}}^{2} = (4\pi/T_{c})\left(\Delta C\right)_{T_{c}}\] where the jump in the zero-\(H\) specific heat at \(T_{c}\),\(\Delta C = 1.43\gamma_{v}T_{c}\) (see, e.g., Ref. 39).

Extrapolation of these data suggests \(T_{c} \approx 1.5\) K for pure amorphous Zr, less than the \(T_{c} \approx 3.5\) K suggested by the measurements of Ref. 9. The high \(\rho_{n}\) and negative-temperature coefficient of resistivity reported for Ti\({}_{87}\)Fe\({}_{13}\) by Meyer _et al._ do not necessarily imply amorphism since similar behavior is observed in crystalline TiFe alloys; J.
