###### Abstract

Here we report the synthesis and basic characterization of LaFe\({}_{1-x}\)Co\({}_{x}\)AsO for several values of \(x\). The parent phase LaFeAsO orders antiferromagnetically (\(T_{N}\)\(\approx\)145 K). Replacing Fe with Co is expected both to electron dope and introduce disorder in the FeAs layer. For \(x\)=0.05 antiferromagnetic order is destroyed and superconductivity is observed at \(T_{c}^{\rm onset}\)=11.2 K. For \(x\)=0.11 superconductivity is observed at \(T_{c}^{\rm onset}\)=14.3 K and for \(x\)=0.15 it is observed at \(T_{c}^{\rm onset}\)=6.0 K. For \(x\)=1, and the material appears to be ferromagnetic as judged by magnetization measurements. We conclude that Co is an effective dopant to induce superconductivity. Somewhat surprisingly, the system appears to tolerate considerable disorder in the FeAs planes.

## I Introduction

The recent reports of \(T_{c}\)\(\sim\)26 K in LaFeAsO\({}_{1-x}\)F\({}_{x}\) (\(x\)\(\sim\) 0.11) (Refs. [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10]) and related materials have attracted a great deal of attention as these appear to be unconventional high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors that are based on iron instead of copper. It is interesting to compare and contrast the behavior of the iron arsenide superconductors with the cuprates. For high-\(T_{c}\) copper oxides, the parent compounds are antiferromagnetic Mott insulators [11] and the magnetic order is suppressed and superconductivity emerges by doping with either electrons or holes. [12] Much like copper oxide superconductors, high \(T_{c}\) in the Fe-based family of \(R\)FeAsO (\(R\) = rare-earth) is caused by doping. Here is a report of superconductivity in LaFeAsO by electron doping by means of cobalt substitution in the layers of FeAs\({}_{4}\) tetrahedra in LaFe\({}_{1-x}\)Co\({}_{x}\)AsO (Fig. 1).

The parent LaFeAsO crystallizes with the ZrCuSiAs-type structure [13] in \(P4/nmm\) space group (No. 129; \(Z\)=2). [4; 15] Electronic structure calculations [16] describe the structure as quasi-two dimensional (2D), composed of sheets of metallic Fe\({}^{2+}\) in between ionic blocks of LaOAs\({}^{2-}\) along the \(c\) axis. Although there is bonding between Fe and As (\(d\) =2.3\(-\)2.4 A), the states near the Fermi level are dominated by Fe \(d\) states lightly mixed with As \(p\) states. LaFeAsO undergoes a continuous or weakly first-order structural phase transition from tetragonal (\(P4/nmm\)) to orthorhombic (\(Cmma\)) upon cooling below 155-160 K (Refs. [8; 17], and [18]); this is followed by a commensurate antiferromagnetic order just below 135-150 K. [7; 8; 19]_Ab initio_ calculations yield Fe magnetic moments ranging from 1.5 to 2.3 \(\mu_{B}\), [5; 20; 21; 22] while weak superlattice reflections in neutron scattering [17] and Mossbauer spectra [7; 8] indicate a much smaller value of 0.25\(-\)0.35 \(\mu_{B}\)/Fe.

Carrier doping plays a major role in the appearance of superconductivity by suppressing the magnetic order and structural phase transition in LaFeAsO\({}_{1-x}\)F\({}_{x}\). [7; 23; 24] Substitution of La for other rare earths (\(R\)) has resulted in finding F-doped \(R\)FeAsO\({}_{1-x}\)F\({}_{x}\) (\(R\)=Pr, Sm, Nd, and Gd) superconductors, [25; 26; 27; 28; 29; 30] giving \(T_{c}\) as high as 55 K in SmFeAsO\({}_{0.9}\)F\({}_{0.30}\). [31] Th\({}^{4+}\) doping in Gd\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)FeAsO gives slightly higher \(T_{c}\) at 56 K. [31] Hole doping, by substituting Sr\({}^{2+}\) for La\({}^{3+}\), results in \(T_{c}\)=25 K. [32] A series of oxygen deficient \(R\)FeAsO\({}_{1-\delta}\) give highest \(T_{c}\)=55 K for SmFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\). [33; 34; 35] Here we report the synthesis and characterization of Co-doped LaFeAsO and find superconductivity for \(\sim\)4\(-\)12% doping levels. Chemically, Co is a better mean of electron doping as carriers are doped directly into the FeAs planes. This also provides information as to how well the superconductors tolerate in-plane disorder.

For LaFe\({}_{1-x}\)Co\({}_{x}\)AsO, experimental details below are followed by a discussion of the crystal structure from powder x-ray and neutron diffractions for (0\(\leq\)\(x\)\(\leq\) 1). The thermodynamic and transport properties of this material will then be presented and discussed. The measurements include field- and temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and Seebeck coefficient.

## II Experimental Details

Polycrystalline samples with LaFe1-xCo\({}_{x}\)AsO (_x_=0, 0.05, 0.11, 0.15, 0.2, 0.5, and 1) nominal compositions were synthesized by stoichiometrically mixing fine powders of LaAs,2 Co3O4 (99.9985%), Fe2O3 (99.99%, calcined at 900 degC for 12 h), and Fe (99.998%), pressing into a pellet, and rapidly heating in silica tubes. The silica tubes were sealed under partial pressure of argon and heated at 1220 degC for ~12 h, then rapidly cooled by shutting off the furnace. Each pellet was reground and reannealed. The source of all elements or compounds was Alfa Aesar.

The initial phase purity and structural identification were made via powder x-ray diffraction using a Scintag XDS 2000 _th_-_th_ diffractometer (Cu _K_a_ radiation). The cell parameters for LaCoAsO were refined using least-squares fitting of the measured peak positions in 2_th_=20 deg-70deg using JADE 6.1 MDI package.

Neutron powder-diffraction data on LaFe1-xCo\({}_{x}\)AsO with _x_=0, 0.11, and 0.15 were collected on the C2 diffractometer36 operated by the Neutron Program for Materials Research of the National Research Council of Canada. Each sample of 1-2 g was placed in a helium-filled vanadium can that was sealed with an indium gasket. Data were collected at two different wavelengths of 1.330910 and 2.372630 A. For _x_=0 and 0.15, powder-diffraction data were collected at 4 and also 300 K. For _x_=0.11, data were collected at 4, 10, 15, 30, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 300 K.

For all the refinements, the pseudo-Voigt function (profile function 3 in GSAS) was used and both Lorentzian and Gaussian widths were allowed to vary. Zero-point parameter was also allowed to change. The background was modeled using a ten-term Chebyshev polynomial function. The lattice parameters for the main as well as impurity phases were refined. Isotropic thermal parameters and fractional coordinates were refined for all the atoms in the primary phase. For \(x\) = 0.11 and 0.15 samples, a single thermal parameter was used for both Fe and Co and the occupancy factors were refined with the constraint that they add up to the full occupancy of the site. The details of the neutron powder refinement conditions and the atomic parameters at 4 or 300 K for \(d\) range of 0.8 to 10.6 A are given in Tables 1 and 2 for \(x\) = 0 and 0.11, respectively.

  2\(c\), O site is at 2\(a\), while Fe/Co may be shared at site 2\(b\). For LaFeAsO, the lattice constants obtained from neutron data were \(a\) = 4.0345(1) A and \(c\) = 8.7387(4) A (see Fig. 2) and compare well with the reported \(a\) = 4.038(1) A and \(c\) = 8.753(6) A.15 The incorporation of Co in \(x\) = 0.11 in the Fe site reduces the cell volume by 0.26% due to contraction of the lattice constant \(c\) [=8.7132(3) A]. For F-doped LaFeAsO1-Fx with \(x\) = 0.11, the lattice constants are found to shrink by 0.17% [4.0277(2) A] and 0.30% [8.7125(4) A], respectively.2

The structure of LaFeAsO at 4 K was refined with orthorhombic space group _Cmma_ (No. 67; \(Z\) = 4), earlier reported at 120 K by Nomura _et al._18 As a result of this phase transition, the _a_- and _b_-crystallographic axes rotate by 45deg. Splitting of several reflections of the room-temperature tetragonal phase (111,112,322) was observed at 150 K as the temperature was lowered to 4 K. The atoms in this low-temperature orthorhombic phase are characterized by the same coordination as that of tetragonal structure. La and As atoms are located on Wyckoff positions 4\(g\), Fe on 4\(b\), and O on 4\(a\).

For LaFe1-,Co\({}_{x}\)AsO with \(x\) = 0.11, similar peak splitting to LaFeAsO was, however, not observed in the diffraction data down to 4 K. The data was refined within the tetragonal \(P\)4/_mmm_ framework, comparable to that for 14% F-doped LaFeAsO structure at 120 K.18 The refined neutron-diffraction pattern at 4 K is shown in Fig. 3(a). The data were refined for the main (89.8%) and impurity phases of FeAs (4.1%) and La\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) (6.1%).

For \(x\) = 0.11, the temperature dependence of lattice parameters and the cell volumes are shown in Fig. 3(b). The \(a\) and \(c\) parameters seem to vary nonlinearly with increasing temperature and by 0.18% and 0.31%, respectively, over the 4 to 300 K region; the cell volume change is 0.68%. It has been suggested that the _R_-As distance and Fe-As-Fe angle are the two crucial parameters in the structure of _R_FeAsO that control the effective bandwidths in these materials and, hence,

However, these differences are significantly larger at 4 K (La-As: 0.11%; Fe-As-Fe: \(-\)0.14%). It is interesting to note that the large distortion of the FeAs\({}_{4}\) tetrahedron in \(x\) = 0.11 is accompanied by a similarly large distortion in La\({}_{4}\)O tetrahedron, whereas F doping in the LaO layer in LaFeAsO causes no distortion in FeAs\({}_{4}\) tetrahedron.[40] F doping in the La\({}_{4}\)O layer changes the Fe-As bond only slightly; however, Co doping in the FeAs\({}_{4}\) layer changes the La-O bond significantly (Table III).

The occupancy of Co on Fe 2\(b\) site refines as LaFe\({}_{0.92(1)}\)C\({}_{0.08(1)}\)AsO for \(x\) = 0.11. Also, the average occupancy of Co for nominally prepared \(x\) = 0.15 sample refines as \(x\) = 0.12(1). Assuming a linear dependence between nominal \(x\) and the Co concentration, the \(x\) = 0.05, 0.2, and 0.5 samples are likely to have ~4%, 16%, and 40% cobalt. Despite the variance between the nominal and measured compositions, they will continue to be presented with their nominal \(x\) values. The three compositions are stoichiometric in oxygen content as 2\(a\) site was refined to unity at every temperature that the data were collected.

From \(x\) = 0 to 1, the reduction in the \(a\) and \(c\) parameters and cell volumes are 0.04%, 3.20%, and 2.79%, respectively (Fig. 4). It was suggested that the _T\({}_{c}\)_ in _R_FeAsO\({}_{1 - \gamma}\) is strongly dependent on the tetrahedral distortion represented by As-Fe-As bond angle.[41] We also observe similar trend from our x-ray data at various concentration of Co. From \(x\) = 0.11 to 0.2, As-Fe-As bond angle decreases from 107.35[5] to 106.99[5] (see Fig. 5). It should be mentioned here that at \(x\) = 0.2, superconductivity is lost (Sec. III B).

### Physical properties

The temperature dependence of molar magnetic susceptibility in 1 T for the LaFe\({}_{1 - x}\)Co\({}_{x}\)AsO system is shown in Fig. 6. For 0 <= \(x\) <= 0.5, _kh_ values vary between 3 x 10-5 and 3.5 x 10-4 cm3/mol at 300 K. These values are smaller than that reported for LaFeAsO\({}_{0.89}\)F\({}_{0.11}\) (1.8 x 10-3 cm3/mol at 300 K and 0.1 T).[2] For LaFeAsO (Fig. 6), magnetic susceptibility decreases with decreasing temperature, with an anomaly at ~150 K and a rise below 50 K. For \(x\) = 0.2 and 0.5, _kh_ is weakly temperature dependent with a gradual increase below 50 K. The field-dependent magnetization data for \(x\) = 0, 0.2, and 0.5 are shown in the inset of Fig. 6 and none of the samples approach saturation at 7 T, reaching <0.003 \(\mu_{B}\)/f.u.

The temperature dependence of magnetization in 1 T for LaCoAsO is shown in Fig. 7(a). The _M_(_T_) increases below ~80 K, indicating possible ferromagnetic ordering. The inset of Fig. 7(a) shows a plot of the inverse magnetization and the fit to a Curie-Weiss law, where _M_/_H_ = \(x\) = _C_/(_T_ = _th_) + _kh__o_; \(C\) is the Curie constant, _th_ is the paramagnetic Weiss temperature, and _kh__o_ is a temperature-independent term. The fit was

  done for \(T\) > 150 K. Assuming Co is the only moment-bearing ion, then the term \(C\) is related to the effective moment in paramagnetic state and the theoretically expected 3.87 \(\mu_{B}\) (_S_ = 3 / 2). Experimentally, the Curie-Weiss fit gives \(\mu_{\rm eff}\) = 1.4 \(\mu_{B}\) per Co. This result is comparable to that recently reported for LaCoAsO.[42] The Weiss temperature is positive and \(\theta\) = 90 K; \(X_{o}\) = -6 x 10-6/mol. Field-dependent magnetization data, _M_(_H_), at 1.8 K are shown in Fig. 7(b). The magnetization rises rapidly up to ~500 G and changes weakly thereafter. The precipitous rise in magnetization at low fields again suggests ferromagnetism. An applied field of ~ 5 T gives 0.46 \(\mu_{B}\)/f.u.; this field is insufficient to saturate the magnetization data to 3 \(\mu_{B}\)/Co2+ as expected for localized high-spin Co2+ ions.

In order to locate the ferromagnetic transition, magnetization isotherms in the vicinity of Curie temperatures have been measured for the construction of Arrott plots[43] in the form of \(M\)2 versus _HM_-1 [Fig. 7(b), inset]; for this sample, 55 < \(T_{c}\) < 58 K. This range of \(T_{c}\) is slightly lower than that reported earlier.[1, 42] Despite the suggestion of a ferromagnetic component in magnetization measurements, there is lack of anomaly in specific heat on several different polycrystalline samples. One scenario that may explain the data is that LaCoAsO is a quasi-2D itinerant metal with strong in-plane ferromagnetic interactions but extremely weak out-of-plane interactions. In this scenario, LaCoAsO would be a strongly exchange-enhanced paramagnet and that application of even a small field produces a large ferromagnetic response.

Figure 8 shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility, measured under zfc and fc conditions at 20 Oe for LaFe1-xCoAsO with \(x\) = 0.15. The susceptibility becomes negative below ~11, 14, and 6 K for \(x\) = 0.05, 0.11, and 0.15, respectively. Assuming theoretical density of roughly 6.68 g/cm3 and _kh_ value of the perfect diamagnetism, we estimate the shielding fraction about 15% and Meissner fraction near 6% at 2 K for \(x\) = 0.05. Although \(x\) = 0.11 has higher \(T_{c}\) value and higher shielding fraction (90%), the Meissner fraction is only about 2%. For \(x\) = 0.15, both the shielding and Meissner fractions are less than 1%. It should be noted that since the Meissner fraction is determined by pinning and penetration effects, its interpretation is ambiguous on sintered samples.

Figure 9(a) shows the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity (_r_) in zero field. Similar to the other reports for LaFeAsO,[5, 8]\(\rho_{300~{}\rm K}\) = 4 \(\rm

 slightly with decreasing temperature peaking at \(\sim\)160 K. This upturn in \(\rho\) is likely associated with the increased charge-carrier scattering by lattice fluctuations related to the onset of the structural transition. The samples with \(x\)=0.05, 0.11, and 0.15 exhibit superconductivity. Higher doping levels of \(x\)=0.2, 0.5, and 1 give only metallic behavior. The electrical conductivity increases by a factor of 8 from LaFeAsO (3\(d^{6}\)) to LaCoAsO (3\(d^{7}\)).

The resistive transitions for the superconducting compositions shift to lower temperatures by applying a magnetic field [Fig. 9(b)]. The transition width for each sample becomes wider with increasing \(H\), a characteristic of type-II superconductivity. Here we define a transition temperature \(T_{c}(H)\), which satisfies the condition that \(\rho(T_{c},H)\) equals a

Anomalies are shown by arrows for \(x\)=0.05 and 0.11. For 0.2 \(\leq\) \(x\)\(\leq\) 1 (bottom), linear fits are below \(\sim\)6 K.

The \(T_{c}\)(_H_) values for \(r\) = 10, 50, and 90% are shown as insets of Fig. 9(b) represented by the upper critical field _H__c_2(_T_). In all cases we find that _H__c_2(_T_) has a linear dependence with no sign of saturation. \(T_{c}\) at zero field for 0.1_p_\({}_{N}\) are 11.2, 14.3, and 6.0 K for \(x\) = 0.05, 0.11, and 0.15, respectively. The transition width \(\Delta T_{c}\) = \(T_{c}\)(90%) - \(T_{c}\)(10%) are 3.2, 2.3, and 3.9 K, respectively. The \(\Delta T_{c}\) values are smaller than the reported 4.5 K for LaFeAsO89F0.11 with \(T_{c}^{\rm{onset}}\) = 28.2 K.2

Figure 10(a) shows the temperature dependence of specific heat in the form of _C_/_T_ versus \(T\)2 from 1.8 to 20 K. For each \(x\) = 0.05 and 0.11, there is clearly a broad specific-heat anomaly below \(\sim\)\(T_{c}\). For \(x\) = 0.2, 0.5, and 1 samples, the _C_/_T_ vs \(T\)2 plot is linear between \(\sim\)2 and 6 K [Fig. 10(a), bottom]. This allows the estimation of electronic \(\gamma\) and lattice \(\beta\) values as \(C\) = _yT_+ _β_T_3. The fits yield \(\gamma\) in units of mJ/(_K_2 mol atom) for \(x\) = 0.2, 0.5, and 1, respectively, as 1.405(1), 1.68(1), and 4.02(1). The value of the Debye temperature (_th__D_) was subsequently calculated in the low-temperature limit (_b_ = 12\(p\)4_R_/5_th_) and _th__D_ = 342(9)K for these samples. This value is comparable to the Debye temperature of ~280 K for LaFeAsO (Ref. 5) and =325 K for LaFeAsO89F0.11.2

For \(x\) = 0.05, the specific heat under magnetic fields of 14 T was measured and subtracted from zero-field data. Figure 10(b) gives the temperature dependence of \(\Delta C/T\) data and illustrates a deviation from high-temperature behavior below \(T_{c}\) \(\sim\) 11 K, peaking at 7 K. The broadened transition reflects the inhomogeneity of superconducting phase, likely due to the random Co distribution. Nevertheless, the observation of specific-heat anomaly at \(T_{c}\) indicates bulk superconductivity in the discovered Co-doped LaFeAsO. The origin of the field dependence of the background is not understood and has yet to be investigated.

The Seebeck coefficient \(S\) of LaFe1-xCoAsO with \(x\) = 0.11 at 0 T is shown in the inset of Fig. 11. \(S\) is negative over the entire temperature range, indicating dominant electron conduction. This result is similar to F doping (_x_ = 0.11) in LaFeAsO and provides evidence for electron doping.2 S varies from -50 _μ_V/K at 300 K to a value of ~65 _μ_V/K at ~160 K then decreases in magnitude as the temperature is lowered further. The maximum in the data is probably due to the competition between dominant electron-like bands and the expected proximity of holelike bands near the Fermi energy. Figure 11 gives the magnetic-field effect below 25 K; \(T_{c}\) at ~14 K is clearly suppressed at 8 T.

## IV Conclusions

In this work we report the synthesis, structure, magnetization, resistivity, specific heat, and Seebeck coefficient of LaFe1-xCoAsO for several values of \(x\). The most important observation is that Co acts as an effective dopant and produces superconductivity in this system. In most respects, LaFe1-xCoAsO behaves similarly to LaFeAsO1-xF\({}_{x}\) but with a smaller \(T_{c}\). This is likely due to the stronger effects of disorder produced by doping in the FeAs layers rather than in the LaO layers. It is actually somewhat surprising that the superconductivity in LaFe1-xCoAsO is quite robust to in-plane disorder and this behavior will need to be understood as part of a comprehensive theory of the superconducting mechanism.
