###### Abstract

Heat capacity and anisotropic thermal expansion were measured for
Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ (x=0, 0.038, 0.074) single crystals. Thermal
expansion is anisotropic and, in tetragonal phase, is significantly
higher along the c axis. Previously reported phase transitions,
including possibly split structural and magnetic for x=0.038, are
clearly seen in both measurements. Uniaxial pressure derivatives of the
superconducting transition temperature inferred from the Ehrenfest
relation have opposite signs for in-plane and c-axis pressures for both
Ba(Fe_(0.96)Co_(0.038))₂As₂ and Ba(Fe_(0.926)Co_(0.074))₂As₂, with the
opposite sign of this anisotropy.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in F-doped LaFeAsO (Ref. 1) and
K-doped BaFe₂As₂ (Ref. 2) compounds caused an outpouring of experimental
and theoretical studies of the materials containing Fe-As layers as a
structural unit. The understanding that Co substitution for Fe in the
(AE)Fe₂As₂ (AE=Ba, Sr, Ca) could be used to both stabilize
superconductivity [3, 4, 5] and simplify growth while improving
homogeneity makes the (AE)(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ series [and in
particular Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ (Refs. 3 and 6-9)] a model system
for studies of physical properties of Fe-As based materials.

The T−x phase diagram for Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ is rather complex [7,
8, 9]. on Co doping the critical temperature of the
structural-antiferromagnetic transition decreases, possibly with a
separation in critical temperatures between these two transitions [7,
8], then, above x∼ 0.035 superconductivity is observed, apparently in
the orthorhombic-antiferromagnetic phase. Above x∼ 0.06 the
structural-magnetic transitions vanish, whereas superconductivity
appears to persist to x∼ 0.12. In this work we report
temperature-dependent heat capacity and thermal expansion for three
samples of Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ with Co concentration chosen so that
they are located in three different parts of the x−T phase diagram: pure
BaFe₂As₂ to serve as a reference point, Ba(Fe_(0.962)Co_(0.038))₂As₂ for
which superconductivity in orthorhombic-antiferromagnetic phase is
reported [7, 8, 9], and Ba(Fe_(0.926)Co_(0.074))₂As₂ that is located
close to the maximum of the superconducting dome and for which no
structural-magnetic phase transition was reported.

Thermal expansion is uniquely sensitive to magnetic, structural, and
superconducting transitions [10]. In addition, the combination of
specific heat and thermal expansion data, in the case of the
second-order phase transitions [the superconducting transitions in the
Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co₂)₂As₂ series], allows for the evaluation of the
uniaxial, often anisotropic, pressure derivatives of the critical
temperatures and possibly get some insight in structure–physical
properties relations in the series.

## II Experimental methods

Single crystals of Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ were grown out of self-flux
using conventional high-temperature solution growth techniques [3, 11].
Detailed description of the crystal growth procedure for this series can
be found elsewhere [7]. The samples are platelike with the plates being
perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis. The in-plane orientation
of the samples at room temperature was determined by the x-ray Laue
technique. Elemental analysis of the samples was performed using
wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDS) in the electron probe
microanalyzer of a JEOL JXA-8200 electronmicropobe [7]. Measured rather
than nominal Co concentrations will be used throughout the text. The
heat capacity of the samples was measured using a hybrid adiabatic
relaxation technique of the heat capacity option in a Quantum Design,
PPMS-14 instrument. Thermal expansion data were obtained using a
capacitive dilatometer constructed of OFHC copper; a detailed
description of the dilatometer is presented elsewhere [12]. The
dilatometer was mounted in a Quantum Design PPMS-14 instrument and was
operated over a temperature range of 1.8-305 K. The samples were cut and
lightly polished so as to have parallel surfaces perpendicular to the
[100] and [001] directions with the distances L between the surfaces
ranging between ap

proximately 0.25-3 mm. Care was taken to remove small parts of the
samples exfoliated near the edges, so that the measurements were
performed on the bulk part of the crystals. Specific heat and thermal
expansion data were taken on warming.

## III Results and Discussion

The heat capacity of the pure BaFe₂As₂ is shown in Fig. 1. The feature
associated with the structural/magnetic transition is narrow and sharp.
The transition temperature is slightly lower than that reported for
polycrystalline samples [13, 14] but consistent with the results on
similarly grown single crystals. [8] The extreme sensitivity of the
structural-magnetic transition temperature, e.g., to small amount of
impurities was clearly seen on crystals grown out of Sn flux. [15] The
value of the electronic specific heat coefficient can be estimated as
γ≈15 mJ/mol K² (right inset of Fig. 1), in agreement with the result in
Ref. [13]. Anisotropic, temperature dependent, linear and volume thermal
expansivities (Δa/a₀, Δc/c₀ and ΔV/V₀, where the changes are taken
relative to the values at 1.8 K) and thermal expansion coefficients
(α_(a), α_(c) and β) are shown in Fig. 2. The structural-magnetic phase
transition is clearly seen in the data. Above the transition, the
relative change in the c-axis thermal expansivity is significantly
larger than that in the a axis [Fig. 2(a)], a fact that is reflected in
more than factor of 3 higher thermal expansion coefficient in this
temperature region [Fig. 2(b)]. The thermal expansion coefficients are
almost temperature independent between ∼200−300 K. At low temperatures,
α_(c) is close to zero at ∼60−110 K.

Thermal expansion in BaFe₂As₂ (for the sample grown out of Sn flux and
with structural-magnetic transition at ∼90 K) was measured via neutron
diffraction. [16] In the tetragonal phase, near room temperature, the
α_(c) is similar to our data, whereas α_(a) and β are reported to be
smaller than in our measurements. This difference may be due to the
difference in samples as well as may reflect the differences in accuracy
of the two experimental techniques.

The temperature-dependent heat capacity of Ba(Fe_(0.962)Co_(0.038))₂As₂
(Ref. [7]) is shown in Fig. 3. Two features separated by ∼9 K are seen
above 60 K. These features are possibly the result of a separation
between the structural and magnetic transitions with Co doping, [7, 8]
although the hypothesis of the chemical inhomogeneity of the sample [7]
cannot be readily excluded. The jump in the specific heat at the
superconducting transition can be estimated as ΔC_(p)/T_(c)≈ 4 mJ/mol
K². Using the BCS weak coupling approximation, ΔC_(p)/γT_(c)= 1.43 and
assuming 100

specific heat coefficient, γ for Ba(Fe_(0.962)Co_(0.038))₂As₂ as ∼2.8
mJ/molK². (The fact that this is a relatively low value will be
discussed in detail below.) Anisotropic thermal expansivities and
thermal expansion coefficients are shown in Fig. 4. Near room
temperature the thermal expansion values of Ba(Fe_(0.962)Co_(0.038))₂As₂
are similar to that of BaFe₂As₂. For Ba(Fe_(0.962)Co_(0.038))₂As₂ all
phase transitions detected in the heat capacity are clearly seen at
similar temperatures in the thermal expansion data. As in the C_(p)(T)
data, two distinct features are observed above 60 K. The higher
temperature feature is stronger and if these two anomalies are
associated with the split structural and magnetic transitions (as
opposed to coinciding as in BaFe₂As₂) it seems reasonable to assume that
the more pronounced upper transition is structural and the lower one is
magnetic, because thermal expansion more directly couples to structural
rather than magnetic transition

for which a sizable magnetoelastic term is required.

Anomalies corresponding to the superconducting transition are
unambiguous in the thermal expansion data [Fig. 4(c), inset]. The signs
of Δα_(a) and Δα_(c) at the superconducting transition are different.
The initial uniaxial pressure derivatives of the superconducting
transition temperature, T_(c), can be estimated using the Ehrenfest
relation [17] for the second-order phase transitions:

$$dT_{c}/dp_{i} = \frac{V_{m}\Delta\alpha_{i}T_{c}}{\Delta C_{p}},$$

where V_(m) is the molar volume [V_(m) = 6.1410⁻⁵ m³ for
Ba(Fe0.962Co0.038)2As2 (Ref. [7]), Δα_(i) is a change in the linear
(i = a, c) or volume (α_(V) = β) thermal expansion coefficient at the
phase transition, and ΔC_(p) is a change in the specific heat at the
phase transition. The inferred (via the Ehrenfest relation) uniaxial
pressure derivatives are listed in Table 1. It is noteworthy that from
these results in-plane uniaxial pressure apparently should cause a
decrease in T_(c), whereas T_(c) is expected to increase when the
uniaxial pressure is applied along the c axis. For a "hydrostatic"
pressure the uniaxial effects are partially compensated.

The temperature-dependent heat capacity of Ba(Fe0.926Co0.074)2As2 (Ref.
[7]) is shown in Fig. 5. The jump in the specific heat at the
superconducting transition can be estimated as ΔC_(p)/T_(c) ≈ 28 mJ/mol
K². Using the BCS weak coupling approximation, ΔC_(p)/γT_(c) = 1.43 and
assuming 100

Anisotropic thermal expansivities and thermal expansion coefficients for
Ba(Fe0.926Co0.074)2As2 are shown in Fig. 6. Near room temperature the
thermal expansion values are similar to that of BaFe2As2 and
Ba(Fe0.962Co0.038)2As2. Anomalies corresponding to the superconducting
transition are clearly seen in the thermal expansion data [Fig. 6(b)].
The signs of Δα_(a) and Δα_(c) at superconducting transition are
different and opposite to that of Ba(Fe0.962Co0.038)2As2. Us

ing the heat capacity data and the Ehrenfest relation, for
Ba(Fe_(0.926)Co_(0.074))₂As₂T_(c) is expected to increase under in-plane
uniaxial pressure and to decrease when the uniaxial pressure is applied
along the c axis. Again, for a "hydrostatic" pressure the uniaxial
effects are partially compensated. The initial uniaxial pressure
derivatives of T_(c) estimated using the Ehrenfest relation are listed
in Table 1. These results can be compared with a recent study of the
anisotropic thermal expansion of the Co-doped sample with a similar
doping level, Ba(Fe_(0.92)Co_(0.08))₂As₂ (Ref. [19]). Room temperature
thermal expansion coefficients are similar to our data, as well as the
sign and the order of magnitude of Δα_(a) and Δα_(c) at superconducting
transition. The Δα_(a) values are very close in both measurements,
whereas Δα_(c), measured along the shorted crystal dimension, are
somewhat different, possibly reflecting the difference between the
samples and errors in the measurements. Still the main result, different
signs of the in-plane and _c_-axis uniaxial pressure derivatives, is
clear and consistent in both measurements.

The inferred "hydrostatic" pressure derivatives (Table 1) can be
(semiqualitatively) compared with the results of direct resistance
measurements under pressure [6] on Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ with nominal
Co concentrations x = 0.04 and 0.10 (dT_(c)/_dP_ = 0.4 K/kbar and 0.065
K/kbar, respectively). The comparison is rather poor, with the
discrepancies possibly caused by the difficulties in thermal expansion
measurements, in particular along the c axis, due to morphology of the
samples, as well as possible contribution from Poisson stresses in these
soft anisotropic materials.

The opposite signs of the uniaxial pressure derivatives of T_(c) were
observed in other materials, both "conventional" [20, 21] and
high-temperature [22] superconductors. Moreover, for YBa₂Cu₃O_(7 − δ)
even in-plane uniaxial pressure derivatives dT_(c)/dp_(a) and
dT_(c)/dp_(b) have different signs. [23, 24, 25, 26] However, at least
for La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄, in which T_(c)(x) dependence has similar dome
shape, the sign of the uniaxial pressure derivatives was reported
independent of doping. [22]

## IV Summary

Thermal expansion of Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ (_x_ = 0, 0.038, and
0.074) single crystals is anisotropic, with α_(c)∼ 3α_(a) at room
temperature, in the tetragonal phase. The values of α_(a) and α_(c) at
room temperature are very similar for all three Co concentrations.
Features associated with the structural-magnetic (_x_ = 0,0.038) and
superconducting (_x_ = 0.038, 0.074) transitions are clearly seen both
in heat capacity and thermal expansion data. For x = 0.038 two features
above 60 K are observed in both measurements, with the higher
temperature anomaly more pronounced than the lower one, in thermal
expansion, which suggests that the higher anomaly is associated with the
structural transition and the lower one with the magnetic. Uniaxial
pressure derivatives of T_(c) are evaluated based on the Ehrenfest
relation. For Ba(Fe_(0.962)Co_(0.038))₂As₂dT_(c)/dp_(a)< 0 and
dT_(c)/dp_(c)> 0, as opposed to dT_(c)/dp_(a)> 0 and dT_(c)/dp_(c)< 0
for Ba(Fe_(0.926)Co_(0.074))₂As₂. So for both samples have anisotropic
uniaxial pressure derivatives of T_(c) but the sign of the anisotropy is
different. This is an unexpected result and it requires confirmation and
understanding. It is consistent though with the change in low
temperature crystal structure from orthorhombic for
Ba(Fe_(0.962)Co_(0.038))₂As₂ to tetragonal for
Ba(Fe_(0.926)Co_(0.074))₂As₂ effecting signature of the superconducting
transition. This result serves as a further evidence of the
superconducting dome existing in both orthorhombic and tetragonal
regions.
