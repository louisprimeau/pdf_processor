###### Abstract

The specific heat of the graphite intercalation compounds KCb, CsCb, and RbCb and their parent material, highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), has been determined between 0.48 and 90 K. The results are analyzed in terms of electronic and lattice contributions. The electronic contribution to the specific heat of these compounds is enhanced by at least 29 times above that for HOPG. Comparisons are made to theoretical band-structure calculations. The lattice contribution shows deviations from a Debye model for T > 5 K, which can be mathematically fitted by an Einstein specific-heat function. While our results for RbCb are unique, comparison with previous results for powder-based KCb and CsCb samples over a limited temperature range suggest that the type of parent graphite and/or details of preparation technique may influence the physical properties of these compounds.

## I Introduction

We have determined the specific heat _Cb_ of the alkali-metal graphite intercalation compounds KCb, CsCb, and RbCb and their parent material, highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) between 0.48 and 90 K. This is the first reported measurement of RbCb and considerably extends the temperature range of previous measurement (limited to 1.5-5 K) of _Cb_ for KCb and CsCb made by Mizutani, Kondow, and Massalski (MKM).1

While the phenomenon of graphite intercalation has been known since 1841,3 recent interest has centered on the two-dimensional behavior of intercalation compounds, which results in highly anisotropic electrical properties. Intercalation increases the in-plane conductivity of graphite and, in one case, room-temperature conductivities comparable to that of copper were reported.3

An intercalation compound of graphite consists of layers of carbon between intercalant layers, the number of layers of carbon determining the stage of the compound. Hence, a stage-1 material consists of alternating layers of carbon and intercalant, as in KCb, CsCb, and RbCb. In addition, in a stage-1 compound, the intercalant layers are close-packed and have no vacancies, as must occur in second- and higher-stage compounds such as KCb, CsCb, etc.4

Footnote 3: The material is not necessarily a single-crystalline material, but it is not a single-crystalline material.

Measurement of the low-temperature specific heat _Cb_ provides information on the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, N(E_{F}), and, through knowledge of the lattice contribution to _Cb_, at least qualitative information on the phonon spectrum, enabling comparison with recent theoretical models. A rigid-band model has been proposed by Dresselhaus _et al._,5 while Inoshita _et al._ have calculated the band structure of KCb using the tight-binding method and the extended H\ddot{\rm c}ckel approximation.6 Our results are compared with these models.

Theoretical calculations of N(E_{F}) do not include electron-phonon effects. The ratio of the theoretical to the experimental value of N(E_{F}) gives a value for the electron-phonon enhancement factor \lambda, which, together with N(E_{F}), can be related to the onset of superconductivity. Superconductivity was initially reported by Hannay _et al._7 at 0.135 K for CsCb, 0.151 K for RbCb, and 0.39 K for KCb, while more recent measurements reported a T_{e} of 0.128 to 0.198 K for KCb.8 As may be expected, we observed no evidence of superconductivity in _Cb_ down to 0.48 K in any of the three materials.

## II Experimental

To determine the specific heat of these air-sensitive compounds, we used a modification of an existing calorimetry cryostat.9,10 Because the samples were air sensitive, they were mounted within a removable calorimeter inside a high-purity nitrogen-atmosphere glove box. The removable calorimeter was sealed full of nitrogen, and the gas was pumped out when the calorimeter had been transferred to and cooled within the cryostat to about 150 K. Use of the removable calorimeter prevented our using a conventional heat switch and necessitated the development of a modification of a thermal-relaxation technique for determination of _Cb_,11,12 This technique requires exponential, rather than linear, extrapola  tion of temperature drifts.

The addenda we used consisted of two small sapphire plates between which the sample was held. One plate was stationary, mounted on Teflon-tipped copper posts, while the other plate was placed on the sample and held down by a Teflon-tipped copper screw. To measure temperature, we used two carbon resistance thermo-meters, Spear 470 and Spear 820 (Ref. 13) attached to one addenda plate with epoxy. The heater was also a carbon resistor mounted on the other plate. The thermometers were calibrated during each data run using small amounts of exchange gas. From 0.4 to 1.5 K, calibrations were made against the vapor pressure of 3He corrected for thermo-molecular effects.14 Above 1.5 K, the reference standards were calibrated germanium resistors.15

Our samples were made from single pieces of HOPG (Ref. 16) and all were 0.5 to 1.5 grams in mass. They were prepared using the two-bulb method in a temperature-controlled two-zone furnace.17 Samples were removed from the furnace when they showed the golden color and expansion characteristic of stage-1 compounds.

Mass was also measured to determine that the increase was that expected for stage 1. Color was tested by random cleaving to make certain that it was the same throughout the samples. Samples made by identical techniques have been x-rayed to identify the stage.18

We are reporting values of C_{p}. Correction to a theoretical C_{u} will be possible when information on the physical properties in the correction term is available.

In presenting our results, we state numbers based on two different molecular formula units. For comparison with theoretical calculations and results for graphite, we use the formula M1/8C, where M is K, Cs, or Rb. The molecular weight of a sample is then given by \frac{1}{8} (atomic weight of _M_) + atomic weight of C. This gives specific heat in mJ/mole of carbon K. For comparison with previous results of MKM, we use their formula unit, _M_C__u. The resulting molecular weight is [8 (atomic weight of C) + atomic weight of _M_]/9, which gives specific heat in mJ/mole of atoms K. Thus, the two specific heats are related by C_{p} (mJ/mole C K) = \frac{1}{8}C_{p} (mJ/mole atoms K). All data presented in Figs. 1, 2, and 3 is given in terms of mJ/mole atoms K.

## III Results and Analysis

The data of C_{p} versus T for the parent HOPG, KC_u_, RbC_u, and CsC_u are shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, using log-log scales to encompass the wide range of temperature and value

  of specific heat and to readily show the variations of dependence of C_{p} on powers of T in the various temperature regions as discussed below.

Our analysis of C_{p} was carried out in terms of two contributions:

\[C_{p} = C_{B} + C_{L}\,,\] (1)

where C_{B} is the electronic contribution (g_T_), which is determined by the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, N(E_{F}), and the electron-phonon enhancement factor \lambda since19

\[\gamma = \frac{1}{3}\pi^{2}k^{2}(1 + \lambda)N(E_{F})\,.\] (2)

The values of \gamma for the four materials are given in Table 1 together with a density of states calculated assuming \lambda = 0. A value of \lambda can be obtained from comparison with theoretical calculations of N(E_{F}) as we discuss below.

Below about 4 K the lattice contribution C_{L} can be described by \beta(0)\gamma^{3}, where the low-temperature limit of the Debye temperature \Theta_{D}(0) is obtained from

\[\Theta_{D}(0) = \left( \frac{1.944 \times 10^{6}\text{ mJ}/\text{m}\text{J}\text{m}\text{e}\text{ K}}{\beta(0)} \right)^{1/3}\,.\] (3)

Resulting values of \beta(0) and \Theta_{D}(0) for the intercalated compounds are given in Table 2, where they are compared with previous results of MKM. Above about 5 K, C_{L} deviates rapidly from the T^{3} contribution expected for a Debye solid up to \Theta_{D}(0)/10 (~40 K for these materials), except in the case of KC8. To exhibit the behavior of C_{L} for the intercalated compounds above 5 K we have plotted C_{L}/T^{3} vs T, as shown in Fig. 5.

## IV Discussion

### Highly oriented pyrolitic graphite: HOPG

The specific-heat values for the parent HOPG are shown in Fig. 1 and the analyzed values of g, _b_(0), and o_{b}(0) are given in Table 3, where they are compared with previous values for natural Madagascar graphite20 and spectroscopic powder.1 In Fig. 1 the small linear contribution is barely apparent. We note that the value of g for our HOPG is closer to that of natural Madagascar graphite than is the same parameter for the powdered graphite used by MKM. The lattice contribution C_{L} of our HOPG varies as T3 only at the lowest temperatures, tending towards a T2.3 behavior above about 10 K. This behavior is consistent with theoretical discussions,21 which attribute the lower power dependence at higher temperatures to the predominantly two-dimensional phonon spectrum. The o_{b}(0) values for the three graphites listed in Table 3 agree closely.

### KC_b_, RbC_b_ and CsC_b_

#### iv.1.1 Electronic specific heat

The electronic contribution to the specific heat (C_{g} = g_T_) is enhanced by at least a factor of 29 above the value for HOPG in these three stage-1 compounds. The values of g obtained are listed in Table 1 in units of mJ/mole of C K and in units of mJ/mole of atoms K and the linear contributions are indicated in Figs. 2, 3, and 4. The values of g are different for each compound, highest in RbC_b_ and lowest in CsC_b_. This is in contrast to the results of MKM, who found the values of g for KC_b_ and CsC_b_ to be within 10% of each other. Their values are also listed in Table 1. Our result for KC_b_ agrees fairly closely with that of MKM, while the values for CsC_b_ differ by 29%. Our value of g for RbC_b_ is at present unique.

That the experimental values of g are different for each compound is not surprising for several reasons. The intercalants differ considerably in

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Sample & _β_(0) & O_{b}(0) & _β_(0) & _β_(0)a \\ (mJ/mole K4) & _β_(K) & _β_(0)a & _β_(0)a \\ RbC_b_ & _0.023 ± 0.001 & 439 ± 6 & & \\ CsC_b_ & _0.031 ± 0.001 & 397 ± 4 & 0.049 & 341 \\ KC_b_ & _0.037 ± 0.001 & 374 ± 4 & 0.1502 ± 0.0013 & 234.8 ± 0.7 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}

 size and, consequently, the _c_-axis expansion occurring upon intercalation varies between compounds. In addition, the intercalant layer stacking sequence differs, at least between KC8 [a_b_b_d_a_ (Ref. 4)] and CsC8 [a_b_b_d_a_ (Ref. 4)]. Further, it is known that the stacking sequence in RbCs can be modified by heat treatment. It is close to a_b_b_d_a_ when synthesized at the temperatures we used, but only becomes perfect a_b_b_d_a_ after additional heating.22

Two theoretical models have recently been used to determine _N_(E_{F}) in these intercalation compounds. The rigid-band approach, proposed by Dresselhaus _et al._5 and also used by MKM gives values of _N_(E_{F}) in reasonable agreement with experiment for stage-2-4 compounds, but under-estimates _N_(E_{F}) for stage 1. Inoshita _et al._6 used a tight-binding approximation to determine _N_(E_{F}) for KC8 obtaining 0.27 states/eV carbon atom, which corresponds to a theoretical g of 0.64 mJ/mole of carbon K3. This value of g, although about 24% below our experimental value for KC8, is 25% higher than our value for CsC8. Such a comparison between alkali metals may reflect the difference in stacking sequences referred to above.

A true comparison of experimental (_g_exp) and theoretical (_g_thore) values must also take into account the electron-phonon enhancement factor l, which relates the two by

\[\gamma_{\text{expt}} = \gamma_{\text{thet}}\left( {1 + \lambda } \right).\]

We may then calculate l using Eq. (4) only for KC8 since theoretical calculations for RbCs and CsC8 have not been made. We obtain l = 0.3 assuming Inoshita's value of _N_(E_{F}). Comparative values of l can be obtained from very high temperature resistivity studies,23 but these are probably not possible with these compounds due to deterioration or stacking sequence changes at high temperatures. Alternatively, the existence of superconductivity in KC8, RbCs, and CsCs provides a value of l. Using the McMillan equation,24 we can determine l knowing G_p_(0), the superconducting transition temperature T_{e}, and the Coulomb repulsive constant _m_* (assumed to be (1):

\[\lambda = \frac{1.04 + \mu^{*}\ln\left( {\Theta_{p}/1.45T_{e}} \right)}{\left( {1 - 0.62\mu *} \right)\ln\left( {\Theta_{p}/1.45T_{e}} \right) - 1.04}.\]

Hannay _et al._ reported a T_{e} for KC8 of 0.55 K, but described this sample as "wet" with excess metal. A stoichiometric sample was reported by them to have a T_{e} = 0.39 K. The transition temperatures for presumably stoichiometric RbCs and CsC8 were reported to be 0.151 and 0.135 K, respectively. These samples were all based on "pyrolitic graphite." We observed no anomaly in the specific heat of these three compounds down to 0.48 K, suggesting that transition temperatures for stoichiometric samples based on HOPG are below this temperature. Recently, Koike _et al._8 reported a T_{e} for KC8 of only 0.128 to 0.198 K, depending on the sample, for HOPG-based compounds. In contrast, a value of T_{e} = 0.08 K was obtained by Kobayashi and Tsujikawa25 for KC8 made from _powdered_ graphite. Using our value of _G_p_ and the average of Koike's values for T_{e} and assuming _m_* = 0.1 in Eq. (5), we find l = 0.3 again, in agreement with the comparison of _g_expt and _g_thore.

Comparison of our specific-heat results for HOPG-based samples with those of MKM for powder-based samples combined with the varying results just quoted for T_{e} strongly suggests that the physical properties of these compounds are dependent upon the nature of the parent graphite, the physical properties of which have already been shown to be source dependent (Table III, Refs. 20 and 21). Inoshita _et al._, in applying the McMillan equation [Eq. (5)] to determine _m_* from physical properties known at the time, combined _th_p_ and _g_exp (to determine _l_) obtained for powder KC8 with a T_{e} for "wet" KC8 made from pyrolitic graphite. Their result (_m_* = -0.01) was thought unreasonable. We find, however, that using values of T_{e} and G_{p} for KC8 made _consistently_ from HOPG _or_ from powder and the respective values of l from Eq. (4), we obtain _m_* values between 0.1 (HOPG based) and 0.04 (powder based), which are physically reasonable, being comparable to the typically quoted value of 0.1. This suggests that the McMillan equation may be applicable to these compounds even though it was originally derived for niobium. Extending this discussion to RbCs and CsC8 is not possible at present since there are no theoretical values of _N_(E_{F}) from which to estimate l.

  graphite, KCa, RbCa, and CsCb by ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy found that the shift of the Fermi level of the compounds compared to that of graphite is highest for RbCb and lowest for CsCb. This sequence is similar to our finding that RbCb has the highest g value of the three compounds and CsCb has the lowest.

### Lattice specific heat C_{L}

We note in Sec. III that C_{L} for these three compounds below about 5 K could be described by the low-temperature approximation of the Debye lattice model and the resulting values of \Theta_{\mathit{p}}(0) are given in Table 2. The values obtained for our samples are higher and closer to those of their parent graphite than are the values of MKM. The difference between our values and those of MKM is most marked in the case of KCa, while our value for RbCa is unique. It is possible that the difference between our values and those of MKM is due to the sample form (HOPG versus powder), but further comparative measurements will be needed to verify this point.

We see from Fig. 2 that C_{\mathit{p}} for KCa continues with a slope very close to 3 above 5 K as would be expected from the Debye model, while in the same temperature region the slopes of the C_{\mathit{p}} vs T graphs for RbCb (Fig. 2) and CsCb (Fig. 3) approach values of 4 to 5. This difference in behavior is emphasized in Fig. 5 where we plot C_{L}/T^{3} vs T for the three compounds. For an ideal Debye solid such a plot would result in a horizontal line at C_{L}/T^{3} = _b_(0) up to about \Theta_{\mathit{p}}(0)/10 (about 40 K) and we see that in the case of KCb the deviation from such a temperature dependence is quite small. For CsCb and RbCb the deviation is very marked. In the case of CsCb, this was attributed to a Schottky anomaly or an Einstein mode by MKM. Specific-heat measurements below 5 K cannot distinguish between these two forms since, mathematically, the low-temperature approximations of these functions are the same.

The appropriate parameters for Schottky and Einstein models were found by subtracting _gT_ and _b_(0)_T_3 from C_{\mathit{p}} between 4 and 10 K and fitting the result to the common low-temperature approximation, of the general form

\[CT^{2} = Ae^{- B/T}\ ,\]

where A determines the oscillator strength and B the excitation energy. Using the full expression for each possible contribution,

\[C_{\mathit{Ein}} = 3nR\ \frac{T_{\mathit{A}}^{2}}{4T^{2}}\text{csch}^{2}\left( \frac{T_{\mathit{A}}}{2T} \right)\]

and

\[C_{\mathit{Sch}} = nR\ \frac{b^{2}}{T^{2}}\frac{g_{0}}{g_{1}}\frac{\exp(\delta/T)}{[1 + (g_{0}/g_{1})\exp(\delta/T)]^{2}}\ ,\]

we plot the resulting values of [C_{\mathit{Ein}}/T^{3} + \beta(0)\rbrack and [C_{\mathit{Sch}}/T  stant, g0 and g1 the degeneracies of the ground and first excited energy levels, and 5 the energy-level splitting. It can be seen from these graphs that _C_Em = _C_Sch up to about 8 K for CsC8 and 14 K for RbC8, then the two models begin to deviate, with the Einstein fit being somewhat closer to the actual data shown in Fig. 5. We conclude that an Einstein model provides the best mathematical fit to these anomalies, within the limits of our analysis. The appropriate mathematical parameters for Eq. (7) are given in Table 4 where they are compared with the values obtained by MKM. From this table we note that the values of 6 agree for CsC8 while the value of n is larger in our CsC8 and much larger for RbC8.

The physical origin of these contributions to C_{L} in CsC8, RbC8, and other intercalation compounds1 is not yet understood, particularly in view of their apparent singular absence in KCg. There are, however, important distinctions between the structure of KC8 and the structure of RbC8 and CsC8 which may alter the lattice contribution to the specific heat, possibly adding extra discrete vibrational modes. The core radius of potassium is such that it will fit into the graphite structure with the ideal interlayer spacing proposed by Rudorff and Schulze.4 It is also known to have an _a__b__c_ interlayer sequencing. On the other hand, the ion core radius of rubidium is 4% too large and that of cesium is 19% too large for the ideal structure. In addition RbC8 is known to change its interlayer structure from _a__b__c_ to _a__b__c_ under appropriate heat treatment4 and CsC8 is known to be _a__b__c_ at room temperature. Thus RbC8 and CsC8 are potentially less well ordered than KC8. This lack of perfect ordering may permit low-lying phonon modes to exist. These could contribute to the specific heat as Schottky-type anomalies or Einstein modes. It has already been suggested that perturbation of graphite lattice modes by the inter-calant may be the source of the "anomalies."22

The difference in sizes between the specific-heat data we obtained and that obtained by MKM suggests that the details of heat treatment, cooling rate, and other factors in the preparation of samples, as well as the nature of the parent graphite, determine the extent of disorder in the sample and, thus, may influence the total specific heat. Studies of the effects of preparation technique and graphite type on the physical properties of intercalation compounds certainly appear necessary.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Sample & T_{B} (K) & n & _T__B_a & _n_a \\ RbC8 & 65 ± 1 & 0.088 & & \\ CsC8 & 48 ± 1 & 0.060 & 47.6 ± 1.0 & 0.042 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}

## V Summary

The specific heat C_{p} of our HOPG-based samples of KC8, RbC8, and CsC8 in the temperature range between 0.48 and 90 K can be analyzed in terms of electronic and lattice contributions. The electronic contribution is different for each of the compounds, but is at least 29 times greater than in the parent HOPG. It is also greater than the predictions of theoretical models to date, though the difference may be due to electron-phonon enhancement, which has not been completely treated theoretically. The lattice contribution provides low-temperature limits to G_{p} which are not more than 70 K below the value for HOPG. Above about 5 K, CsC8 and RbC8 show a large increase in specific heat over that of KC8. While the physical source of this is not yet known, it can be described mathematically by an Einstein specific-heat function.

Our results agree with the general pattern of those of MKM, which were obtained for graphite powder based KC8 and CsC8 over a much narrower temperature range, but disagree numerically. This suggests strongly that the form and nature of the parent graphite and/or fine details of the preparation techniques may influence physical properties of the resulting intercalation compounds. Further studies of these compounds and higher-stage compounds are currently in progress.

###### Abstract

The specific heat of the graphite intercalation compounds KCb, CsCb, and RbCb and their parent material, highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), has been determined between 0.48 and 90 K. The results are analyzed in terms of electronic and lattice contributions. The electronic contribution to the specific heat of these compounds is enhanced by at least 29 times above that for HOPG. Comparisons are made to theoretical band-structure calculations. The lattice contribution shows deviations from a Debye model for T > 5 K, which can be mathematically fitted by an Einstein specific-heat function. While our results for RbCb are unique, comparison with previous results for powder-based KCb and CsCb samples over a limited temperature range suggest that the type of parent graphite and/or details of preparation technique may influence the physical properties of these compounds.

## I Introduction

We have determined the specific heat _Cb_ of the alkali-metal graphite intercalation compounds KCb, CsCb, and RbCb and their parent material, highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) between 0.48 and 90 K. This is the first reported measurement of RbCb and considerably extends the temperature range of previous measurement (limited to 1.5-5 K) of _Cb_ for KCb and CsCb made by Mizutani, Kondow, and Massalski (MKM).1

While the phenomenon of graphite intercalation has been known since 1841,3 recent interest has centered on the two-dimensional behavior of intercalation compounds, which results in highly anisotropic electrical properties. Intercalation increases the in-plane conductivity of graphite and, in one case, room-temperature conductivities comparable to that of copper were reported.3

An intercalation compound of graphite consists of layers of carbon between intercalant layers, the number of layers of carbon determining the stage of the compound. Hence, a stage-1 material consists of alternating layers of carbon and intercalant, as in KCb, CsCb, and RbCb. In addition, in a stage-1 compound, the intercalant layers are close-packed and have no vacancies, as must occur in second- and higher-stage compounds such as KCb, CsCb, etc.4

Measurement of the low-temperature specific heat _Cb_ provides information on the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, N(E_{F}), and, through knowledge of the lattice contribution to _Cb_, at least qualitative information on the phonon spectrum, enabling comparison with recent theoretical models. A rigid-band model has been proposed by Dresselhaus _et al._,5 while Inoshita _et al._ have calculated the band structure of KCb using the tight-binding method and the extended H\ddot{\rm c}ckel approximation.6 Our results are compared with these models.

Theoretical calculations of N(E_{F}) do not include electron-phonon effects. The ratio of the theoretical to the experimental value of N(E_{F}) gives a value for the electron-phonon enhancement factor \lambda, which, together with N(E_{F}), can be related to the onset of superconductivity. Superconductivity was initially reported by Hannay _et al._7 at 0.135 K for CsCb, 0.151 K for RbCb, and 0.39 K for KCb, while more recent measurements reported a T_{e} of 0.128 to 0.198 K for KCb.8 As may be expected, we observed no evidence of superconductivity in _Cb_ down to 0.48 K in any of the three materials.

## II Experimental

To determine the specific heat of these air-sensitive compounds, we used a modification of an existing calorimetry cryostat.9,10 Because the samples were air sensitive, they were mounted within a removable calorimeter inside a high-purity nitrogen-atmosphere glove box. The removable calorimeter was sealed full of nitrogen, and the gas was pumped out when the calorimeter had been transferred to and cooled within the cryostat to about 150 K. Use of the removable calorimeter prevented our using a conventional heat switch and necessitated the development of a modification of a thermal-relaxation technique for determination of _Cb_,11,12 This technique requires exponential, rather than linear, extrapola  tion of temperature drifts.

The addenda we used consisted of two small sapphire plates between which the sample was held. One plate was stationary, mounted on Teflon-tipped copper posts, while the other plate was placed on the sample and held down by a Teflon-tipped copper screw. To measure temperature, we used two carbon resistance thermo-meters, Spear 470 and Spear 820 (Ref. 13) attached to one addenda plate with epoxy. The heater was also a carbon resistor mounted on the other plate. The thermometers were calibrated during each data run using small amounts of exchange gas. From 0.4 to 1.5 K, calibrations were made against the vapor pressure of 3He corrected for thermo-molecular effects.14 Above 1.5 K, the reference standards were calibrated germanium resistors.15

Our samples were made from single pieces of HOPG (Ref. 16) and all were 0.5 to 1.5 grams in mass. They were prepared using the two-bulb method in a temperature-controlled two-zone furnace.17 Samples were removed from the furnace when they showed the golden color and expansion characteristic of stage-1 compounds.

Mass was also measured to determine that the increase was that expected for stage 1. Color was tested by random cleaving to make certain that it was the same throughout the samples. Samples made by identical techniques have been x-rayed to identify the stage.18

We are reporting values of C_{p}. Correction to a theoretical C_{u} will be possible when information on the physical properties in the correction term is available.

In presenting our results, we state numbers based on two different molecular formula units. For comparison with theoretical calculations and results for graphite, we use the formula M1/8C, where M is K, Cs, or Rb. The molecular weight of a sample is then given by \frac{1}{8} (atomic weight of _M_) + atomic weight of C. This gives specific heat in mJ/mole of carbon K. For comparison with previous results of MKM, we use their formula unit, _M_C__u. The resulting molecular weight is [8 (atomic weight of C) + atomic weight of _M_]/9, which gives specific heat in mJ/mole of atoms K. Thus, the two specific heats are related by C_{p} (mJ/mole C K) = \frac{1}{8}C_{p} (mJ/mole atoms K). All data presented in Figs. 1, 2, and 3 is given in terms of mJ/mole atoms K.

## III Results and Analysis

The data of C_{p} versus T for the parent HOPG, KC_u_, RbC_u, and CsC_u are shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, using log-log scales to encompass the wide range of temperature and value

  of specific heat and to readily show the variations of dependence of C_{p} on powers of T in the various temperature regions as discussed below.

Our analysis of C_{p} was carried out in terms of two contributions:

\[C_{p} = C_{B} + C_{L}\,,\] (1)

where C_{B} is the electronic contribution (g_T_), which is determined by the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, N(E_{F}), and the electron-phonon enhancement factor \lambda since19

\[\gamma = \frac{1}{3}\pi^{2}k^{2}(1 + \lambda)N(E_{F})\,.\] (2)

The values of \gamma for the four materials are given in Table 1 together with a density of states calculated assuming \lambda = 0. A value of \lambda can be obtained from comparison with theoretical calculations of N(E_{F}) as we discuss below.

Below about 4 K the lattice contribution C_{L} can be described by \beta(0)\gamma^{3}, where the low-temperature limit of the Debye temperature \Theta_{D}(0) is obtained from

\[\Theta_{D}(0) = \left( \frac{1.944 \times 10^{6}\text{ mJ}/\text{m}\text{J}\text{m}\text{e}\text{ K}}{\beta(0)} \right)^{1/3}\,.\] (3)

Resulting values of \beta(0) and \Theta_{D}(0) for the intercalated compounds are given in Table 2, where they are compared with previous results of MKM. Above about 5 K, C_{L} deviates rapidly from the T^{3} contribution expected for a Debye solid up to \Theta_{D}(0)/10 (~40 K for these materials), except in the case of KC8. To exhibit the behavior of C_{L} for the intercalated compounds above 5 K we have plotted C_{L}/T^{3} vs T, as shown in Fig. 5.

## IV Discussion

### Highly oriented pyrolitic graphite: HOPG

The specific-heat values for the parent HOPG are shown in Fig. 1 and the analyzed values of g, _b_(0), and o_{b}(0) are given in Table 3, where they are compared with previous values for natural Madagascar graphite20 and spectroscopic powder.1 In Fig. 1 the small linear contribution is barely apparent. We note that the value of g for our HOPG is closer to that of natural Madagascar graphite than is the same parameter for the powdered graphite used by MKM. The lattice contribution C_{L} of our HOPG varies as T3 only at the lowest temperatures, tending towards a T2.3 behavior above about 10 K. This behavior is consistent with theoretical discussions,21 which attribute the lower power dependence at higher temperatures to the predominantly two-dimensional phonon spectrum. The o_{b}(0) values for the three graphites listed in Table 3 agree closely.

### KC_b_, RbC_b_ and CsC_b_

#### iv.1.1 Electronic specific heat

The electronic contribution to the specific heat (C_{g} = g_T_) is enhanced by at least a factor of 29 above the value for HOPG in these three stage-1 compounds. The values of g obtained are listed in Table 1 in units of mJ/mole of C K and in units of mJ/mole of atoms K and the linear contributions are indicated in Figs. 2, 3, and 4. The values of g are different for each compound, highest in RbC_b_ and lowest in CsC_b_. This is in contrast to the results of MKM, who found the values of g for KC_b_ and CsC_b_ to be within 10% of each other. Their values are also listed in Table 1. Our result for KC_b_ agrees fairly closely with that of MKM, while the values for CsC_b_ differ by 29%. Our value of g for RbC_b_ is at present unique.

That the experimental values of g are different for each compound is not surprising for several reasons. The intercalants differ considerably in

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Sample & _β_(0) & O_{b}(0) & _β_(0) & _β_(0)a \\ (mJ/mole K4) & _β_(K) & _β_(0)a & _β_(0)a \\ RbC_b_ & _0.023 ± 0.001 & 439 ± 6 & & \\ CsC_b_ & _0.031 ± 0.001 & 397 ± 4 & 0.049 & 341 \\ KC_b_ & _0.037 ± 0.001 & 374 ± 4 & 0.1502 ± 0.0013 & 234.8 ± 0.7 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Lattice parameters calculated per mole of atoms.

 size and, consequently, the _c_-axis expansion occurring upon intercalation varies between compounds. In addition, the intercalant layer stacking sequence differs, at least between KC8 [a_b_b_d_a_ (Ref. 4)] and CsC8 [a_b_b_d_a_ (Ref. 4)]. Further, it is known that the stacking sequence in RbCs can be modified by heat treatment. It is close to a_b_b_d_a_ when synthesized at the temperatures we used, but only becomes perfect a_b_b_d_a_ after additional heating.22

Two theoretical models have recently been used to determine _N_(E_{F}) in these intercalation compounds. The rigid-band approach, proposed by Dresselhaus _et al._5 and also used by MKM gives values of _N_(E_{F}) in reasonable agreement with experiment for stage-2-4 compounds, but under-estimates _N_(E_{F}) for stage 1. Inoshita _et al._6 used a tight-binding approximation to determine _N_(E_{F}) for KC8 obtaining 0.27 states/eV carbon atom, which corresponds to a theoretical g of 0.64 mJ/mole of carbon K3. This value of g, although about 24% below our experimental value for KC8, is 25% higher than our value for CsC8. Such a comparison between alkali metals may reflect the difference in stacking sequences referred to above.

A true comparison of experimental (_g_exp) and theoretical (_g_thore) values must also take into account the electron-phonon enhancement factor l, which relates the two by

\[\gamma_{\text{expt}} = \gamma_{\text{thet}}\left( {1 + \lambda } \right).\]

We may then calculate l using Eq. (4) only for KC8 since theoretical calculations for RbCs and CsC8 have not been made. We obtain l = 0.3 assuming Inoshita's value of _N_(E_{F}). Comparative values of l can be obtained from very high temperature resistivity studies,23 but these are probably not possible with these compounds due to deterioration or stacking sequence changes at high temperatures. Alternatively, the existence of superconductivity in KC8, RbCs, and CsCs provides a value of l. Using the McMillan equation,24 we can determine l knowing G_p_(0), the superconducting transition temperature T_{e}, and the Coulomb repulsive constant _m_* (assumed to be (1):

\[\lambda = \frac{1.04 + \mu^{*}\ln\left( {\Theta_{p}/1.45T_{e}} \right)}{\left( {1 - 0.62\mu *} \right)\ln\left( {\Theta_{p}/1.45T_{e}} \right) - 1.04}.\]

Hannay _et al._ reported a T_{e} for KC8 of 0.55 K, but described this sample as "wet" with excess metal. A stoichiometric sample was reported by them to have a T_{e} = 0.39 K. The transition temperatures for presumably stoichiometric RbCs and CsC8 were reported to be 0.151 and 0.135 K, respectively. These samples were all based on "pyrolitic graphite." We observed no anomaly in the specific heat of these three compounds down to 0.48 K, suggesting that transition temperatures for stoichiometric samples based on HOPG are below this temperature. Recently, Koike _et al._8 reported a T_{e} for KC8 of only 0.128 to 0.198 K, depending on the sample, for HOPG-based compounds. In contrast, a value of T_{e} = 0.08 K was obtained by Kobayashi and Tsujikawa25 for KC8 made from _powdered_ graphite. Using our value of _G_p_ and the average of Koike's values for T_{e} and assuming _m_* = 0.1 in Eq. (5), we find l = 0.3 again, in agreement with the comparison of _g_expt and _g_thore.

Comparison of our specific-heat results for HOPG-based samples with those of MKM for powder-based samples combined with the varying results just quoted for T_{e} strongly suggests that the physical properties of these compounds are dependent upon the nature of the parent graphite, the physical properties of which have already been shown to be source dependent (Table III, Refs. 20 and 21). Inoshita _et al._, in applying the McMillan equation [Eq. (5)] to determine _m_* from physical properties known at the time, combined _th_p_ and _g_exp (to determine _l_) obtained for powder KC8 with a T_{e} for "wet" KC8 made from pyrolitic graphite. Their result (_m_* = -0.01) was thought unreasonable. We find, however, that using values of T_{e} and G_{p} for KC8 made _consistently_ from HOPG _or_ from powder and the respective values of l from Eq. (4), we obtain _m_* values between 0.1 (HOPG based) and 0.04 (powder based), which are physically reasonable, being comparable to the typically quoted value of 0.1. This suggests that the McMillan equation may be applicable to these compounds even though it was originally derived for niobium. Extending this discussion to RbCs and CsC8 is not possible at present since there are no theoretical values of _N_(E_{F}) from which to estimate l.

  graphite, KCa, RbCa, and CsCb by ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy found that the shift of the Fermi level of the compounds compared to that of graphite is highest for RbCb and lowest for CsCb. This sequence is similar to our finding that RbCb has the highest g value of the three compounds and CsCb has the lowest.

### Lattice specific heat C_{L}

We note in Sec. III that C_{L} for these three compounds below about 5 K could be described by the low-temperature approximation of the Debye lattice model and the resulting values of \Theta_{\mathit{p}}(0) are given in Table 2. The values obtained for our samples are higher and closer to those of their parent graphite than are the values of MKM. The difference between our values and those of MKM is most marked in the case of KCa, while our value for RbCa is unique. It is possible that the difference between our values and those of MKM is due to the sample form (HOPG versus powder), but further comparative measurements will be needed to verify this point.

We see from Fig. 2 that C_{\mathit{p}} for KCa continues with a slope very close to 3 above 5 K as would be expected from the Debye model, while in the same temperature region the slopes of the C_{\mathit{p}} vs T graphs for RbCb (Fig. 2) and CsCb (Fig. 3) approach values of 4 to 5. This difference in behavior is emphasized in Fig. 5 where we plot C_{L}/T^{3} vs T for the three compounds. For an ideal Debye solid such a plot would result in a horizontal line at C_{L}/T^{3} = _b_(0) up to about \Theta_{\mathit{p}}(0)/10 (about 40 K) and we see that in the case of KCb the deviation from such a temperature dependence is quite small. For CsCb and RbCb the deviation is very marked. In the case of CsCb, this was attributed to a Schottky anomaly or an Einstein mode by MKM. Specific-heat measurements below 5 K cannot distinguish between these two forms since, mathematically, the low-temperature approximations of these functions are the same.

The appropriate parameters for Schottky and Einstein models were found by subtracting _gT_ and _b_(0)_T_3 from C_{\mathit{p}} between 4 and 10 K and fitting the result to the common low-temperature approximation, of the general form

\[CT^{2} = Ae^{- B/T}\ ,\]

where A determines the oscillator strength and B the excitation energy. Using the full expression for each possible contribution,

\[C_{\mathit{Ein}} = 3nR\ \frac{T_{\mathit{A}}^{2}}{4T^{2}}\text{csch}^{2}\left( \frac{T_{\mathit{A}}}{2T} \right)\]

and

\[C_{\mathit{Sch}} = nR\ \frac{b^{2}}{T^{2}}\frac{g_{0}}{g_{1}}\frac{\exp(\delta/T)}{[1 + (g_{0}/g_{1})\exp(\delta/T)]^{2}}\ ,\]

we plot the resulting values of [C_{\mathit{Ein}}/T^{3} + \beta(0)\rbrack and [C_{\mathit{Sch}}/T  stant, g0 and g1 the degeneracies of the ground and first excited energy levels, and 5 the energy-level splitting. It can be seen from these graphs that _C_Em = _C_Sch up to about 8 K for CsC8 and 14 K for RbC8, then the two models begin to deviate, with the Einstein fit being somewhat closer to the actual data shown in Fig. 5. We conclude that an Einstein model provides the best mathematical fit to these anomalies, within the limits of our analysis. The appropriate mathematical parameters for Eq. (7) are given in Table 4 where they are compared with the values obtained by MKM. From this table we note that the values of 6 agree for CsC8 while the value of n is larger in our CsC8 and much larger for RbC8.

The physical origin of these contributions to C_{L} in CsC8, RbC8, and other intercalation compounds1 is not yet understood, particularly in view of their apparent singular absence in KCg. There are, however, important distinctions between the structure of KC8 and the structure of RbC8 and CsC8 which may alter the lattice contribution to the specific heat, possibly adding extra discrete vibrational modes. The core radius of potassium is such that it will fit into the graphite structure with the ideal interlayer spacing proposed by Rudorff and Schulze.4 It is also known to have an _a__b__c_ interlayer sequencing. On the other hand, the ion core radius of rubidium is 4% too large and that of cesium is 19% too large for the ideal structure. In addition RbC8 is known to change its interlayer structure from _a__b__c_ to _a__b__c_ under appropriate heat treatment4 and CsC8 is known to be _a__b__c_ at room temperature. Thus RbC8 and CsC8 are potentially less well ordered than KC8. This lack of perfect ordering may permit low-lying phonon modes to exist. These could contribute to the specific heat as Schottky-type anomalies or Einstein modes. It has already been suggested that perturbation of graphite lattice modes by the inter-calant may be the source of the "anomalies."22

The difference in sizes between the specific-heat data we obtained and that obtained by MKM suggests that the details of heat treatment, cooling rate, and other factors in the preparation of samples, as well as the nature of the parent graphite, determine the extent of disorder in the sample and, thus, may influence the total specific heat. Studies of the effects of preparation technique and graphite type on the physical properties of intercalation compounds certainly appear necessary.

## V Summary

The specific heat C_{p} of our HOPG-based samples of KC8, RbC8, and CsC8 in the temperature range between 0.48 and 90 K can be analyzed in terms of electronic and lattice contributions. The electronic contribution is different for each of the compounds, but is at least 29 times greater than in the parent HOPG. It is also greater than the predictions of theoretical models to date, though the difference may be due to electron-phonon enhancement, which has not been completely treated theoretically. The lattice contribution provides low-temperature limits to G_{p} which are not more than 70 K below the value for HOPG. Above about 5 K, CsC8 and RbC8 show a large increase in specific heat over that of KC8. While the physical source of this is not yet known, it can be described mathematically by an Einstein specific-heat function.

Our results agree with the general pattern of those of MKM, which were obtained for graphite powder based KC8 and CsC8 over a much narrower temperature range, but disagree numerically. This suggests strongly that the form and nature of the parent graphite and/or fine details of the preparation techniques may influence physical properties of the resulting intercalation compounds. Further studies of these compounds and higher-stage compounds are currently in progress.
