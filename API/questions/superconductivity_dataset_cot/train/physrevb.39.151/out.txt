###### Abstract

Measurements of the superconducting- and normal-state heat capacity of U_{\phi}_X_ (_X_ = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) compounds have been performed over a temperature range 1 K \leq T\leq 35 K. The U_{\phi}_X_ compounds have strong renormalizations of the free-carrier effective mass m * in the range 10m_{e} \leq m * \leq 50m_{e} (m_{e} \equiv free-electron mass). The unusual magnitude and temperature dependence of the U_{\phi}_X_ heat capacities suggest the presence of high densities of low-energy excitations of undetermined nature. The results are analyzed in terms of models appropriate to heavy-fermion liquids, and anisotropic or strong-coupled superconductors. The U_{\phi}_X_ compounds form a link between relatively low-_m_ *, high-transition-temperature A15 compounds and the more extreme examples of heavy-fermion superconductors such as UBe_{13}, UPt_{13}, and CeCuSi_{2} for which m * \sim 10^{2}m_{e}.

## I Introduction

The U_{\phi}_X_ (_X_ \equiv Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) phases are among the earliest known U superconductors and include the first examples of superconducting Fe or Mn compounds.[1] In spite of their content of ferromagnetic 3d elements and strong paramagnetism,[2, 3, 4, 5] the highest-known upper critical magnetic field _H_{c2}_ and superconducting transition temperature _T_{c}_ for U compounds are observed within this class of materials.[6] Indeed, these compounds have long been cited as intriguing examples of the puzzling interplay between magnetism and superconductivity.[7, 8, 9, 10] Recently, U_{6}Fe was observed[11, 12, 13] to exhibit anomalous low-temperature properties that were attributed to "heavy fermions"[14] resulting from the hybridization between localized 5f and itinerant conduction electron states.[15]

Measurement of the low-temperature heat capacity has proven to be a very useful method of characterizing the strength and character of the many-body correlations between heavy-fermion quasiparticles.[16] The magnitude and temperature dependence of the low-temperature electronic contribution of the normal-state heat capacity reflect the magnitude of the fermion effective mass m * and low-energy structure in the quasiparticle density of states. Measurements at and below _T_{c}_ are crucial in proving the bulk nature of the superconducting state and provide useful constraints on parameters characterizing the heavy quasiparticles.[12, 13, 14]

We have performed measurements of the low-temperature heat capacity of the U_{\phi}_X_ (_X_ \equiv Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) compounds. Analyses of the resulting data indicate that these materials have strong renormalizations of the fermion mass in the range 10 \leq m * /m_{e} \leq 50 (m_{e} \equiv free-electron mass). The temperature dependences of the U_{\phi}_X_ heat capacities generally reflect the presence of a high density of low-energy excitations of undetermined nature. The data are consistent with a picture in which the U_{\phi}_X_ compounds are exchange-enhanced paramagnets that form a link between narrow-band transition metals--particularly high-_T_{c}_A_15 compounds--and heavy-fermion superconductors such as UBe_{13} (Ref. [17]) and UPt_{13}.[18]

## II Experimental details

Samples were prepared from high-purity starting materials by arc melting in a pure argon atmosphere. A Zr getter was melted several times, followed by several cycles of melting, turning, and remelting of the U-_X_ charge on a water-cooled copper hearth. A slight excess of U was used in the sample melt in order to suppress the amount of UX_{2} phase that is introduced in the peritectic formation of all of the U_{\phi}_X_ compounds.[19] After removal from the arc furnace, the samples were wrapped in Ta foil and sealed in evacuated quartz ampoules and annealed at temperatures just below the peritecites. Details of the sample preparation are summarized in Table 1.

Routine x-ray diffraction scans of the U_{6}Mn, U_{6}Co, and U_{6}Ni materials studied herein were conducted on unannealed powder samples. The diffraction peaks were broad and poorly resolved, but could be completely indexed in terms of the majority U_{\phi}Mn-type structure,[19] although a few weak peaks were explained as due to U oxides or C15-type, UMn_{2} (in the case of the U_{\phi}Mn sample, only) phase.[19] The short penetration depth of x rays in U compounds and the strain broadening expected in powder samples of the U6X phases [5] can account for the poor quality of the x-ray data. Broadening of the inductively measured superconducting transitions of unannealed powder samples of U6Mn, U6Co, and U6Ni (see Table 1) has also been observed.

Our U6Fe sample No. II-33 is the same one studied in the heat capacity, _H_c2, and electrical resistivity measurements reported in Refs. 11-13. X-ray diffraction and metallography studies were conducted on this sample with contributions by Roof and Pereyra of Los Alamos National Laboratory. Sample II-33 was found to be at least 95% single phase from x-ray measurements, although more sensitive metallography work detected small amounts of U oxide inclusions and excess U lodged at grain boundaries. [12, 13] Engelhardt [20] and White _et al._[21] have done extensive work on the effects of stoichiometry and annealing on the _T_c's of U_c_X compounds. A detailed discussion of impurity phases present in U6_c_X compounds is included in a report [5] of magnetization measurements on sample II-33 and other U6_c_X_ materials, and will not be discussed further here.

Heat-capacity measurements were performed using a semidatabic heat-pulse calorimeter with a mechanical heat switch. The calorimeter was attached to a 3He evaporation refrigerator providing an experimental temperature range 0.85 K  T  35 K in applied magnetic fields of zero and 2 kOe. Details of the methods used in analyzing the calorimetric data are given in Sec. III.

Magnetization measurements were performed on a section of the U6Mn sample II-46, only. An SHE (Biotechnologies, Inc.) magnetometer was used to cover the temperature range 2 K  T  300 K and applied magnetic fields  H  2.0 T. Demagnetization and anisotropy effects were neglected in these measurements and the associated analysis.

## III Methods of data analysis

The "strong form" of the third law of thermodynamics implies that the entropy S can be related to the constant-volume heat capacity C_{V} via

\[S(T) = \int_{0}^{T}\frac{{{\it C}_{V} }}{{{\it t}}}dt\ \ ,\]

where _S_(0)  = 0. Most experimental heat-capacity measurements, on the other hand, yield data for the constant-pressure heat capacity C_{P}. These results can, in principle, be used to calculate the more fundamental quantity C_{V} through the relation

\[C_{P} - C_{V} = {{\it V}T}\frac{{{\it\alpha}_{P}^2}}{{{\it\kappa}_T}}\ \ ,\]

where a_{P} is the isobaric thermal expansion coefficient and k_{T} is the isothermal compressibility. However, the difference between C_{P} and C_{V} is usually less than 1% for most metals below room temperature,22 and is generally neglected in the analysis of experimental results. We will therefore assume in this paper that our C_{P} data accurately reflect the behavior of C_{V}.

There are several methods of analysis which can be employed to extract important physical parameters from experimental heat capacity data for metals. We have chosen to apply two quite different methods that are reasonably representative of the more familiar models of the thermal behavior of superconductors. We will describe the strengths and weaknesses of each of these methods, and summarize and compare the numerical results that they yield.

### Polynomial method

The results of low-temperature normal-state heat-capacity measurements are frequently analyzed by fitting

  data to a low-power polynomial of the form

\[C_{Vn} = \gamma^{\star}T + \beta T^{3} + \alpha T^{5}\ .\]

\gamma^{\star} is the electronic coefficient given by

\[\gamma^{\star} = \frac{2\pi^{2}}{3}k_{B}^{2}N^{\star}(E_{F})\ ,\]

where N^{\star}(E_{F}) is the renormalized electronic density of states at the Fermi energy, and the coefficient \beta of the low-temperature phonon term is given by

\[\beta = \frac{12\pi^{4}N_{A}k_{B}n}{5\beta_{D}^{3}}\ ,\]

where N_{A} is Avogadro's number, \theta_{D} is the Debye temperature and n = number of atoms per formula unit. The \alpha coefficient is best considered as a fitting parameter that approximates finite-temperature corrections to the low-temperature behavior of the electron and lattice systems. Some care must be exercised in applying the model of Eqs. (3)-(5) to particular metals. Strictly speaking, Eq. (3) should not be applied at temperatures T > \kern-1.0pt\lower 0.43pt\hbox{$>$}\kern-1.0pt\lower 3.01pt\hbox{$\sim$}\theta_{D}/50 (Ref. [23]), or in situations where \gamma^{\star} is effectively "temperature dependent" as is the case in UPt3, UBe13, CeCu2Si2, and certain other heavy-fermion materials.16

Footnote 16: The \beta_{D} and \alpha_{D} parameters of the model are used to calculate the effective charge density of states at the Fermi energy.

Analyses performed on superconducting-state data must deal with the finite discontinuity \Delta C in heat capacity at T_{c}. This discontinuity is always broadened in laboratory situations due to the presence of coexisting normal and superconducting regions in imperfect sample materials within a temperature interval \Delta T_{c} about the ideal transition point. Therefore, we have chosen to initially integrate the experimental data according to Eq. (1) in order to obtain the superconducting-state entropy S_{s}(T). This procedure has several advantages. First, since the normal-state entropy S_{n} satisfies the relation S_{n}(T_{c}) = S_{s}(T_{c}), the errors introduced by fitting the _integrated_C_{V} data near T_{c} are minimal. Second, the entropy relation at T_{c} provides a useful constraint on the parameters derived from the fits of S_{n}(T) conducted over finite-temperature intervals. Third, the entropy difference \Delta S = S_{n}-S_{s} is also required in calculating the behavior of the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}. Of course, a realistic extrapolation of S_{s}(T) as T \to 0 is required, similar to the normal-state case.

The superconducting-state heat capacity is assumed to have the form [see the discussion of Eqs. (27) and (28)]

\[C_{V_{S}}=Ae^{-B/T} + \beta T^{3} + \alpha T^{5}\ .\]

We note that this form is not strictly valid (especially for strong-coupled materials), but should provide a reasonably accurate extrapolation of C_{V_{S}} in the absence of anomalous low-temperature behavior [such as observed for (U1_{- x}Th_{x})Be13 alloys (Ref. [24]).

An iterative method was employed to obtain self-consistent fits for both the normal- and superconducting-state data. The procedure can be broken down into several steps.

(1) "Zeroth-order" approximations \alpha = \alpha_{0} and \beta = \beta_{0} are obtained from fits of the data to Eq. (3) over limited temperature intervals extending above T_{c} where C_{V_{n}}T^{-1} versus T^{2} plots are nearly linear.

(2) The \beta_{0} and \alpha_{0} parameters of step (1) are used to calculate the electronic contributions C_{es} to C_{V_{S}} where

\[C_{es} \equiv A_{0}e^{-B_{0}/T} = C_{V_{S}} - \alpha_{0}T^{5} - \beta_{0}T^{3}\ .\]

A linear, least-squares fit of the processed data of lnC_{es} versus T^{-1} yields the parameters A_{0} and B_{0} for "zeroth order."

(3) The parameters \alpha_{c}, \beta_{0}, A_{0}, and B_{0} are then used to calculate the entropy for T = T_{\rm min}, the lowest measuring temperature:

\[S_{\rm min} = A_{0}\int_{0}^{T_{\rm min}}\frac{e^{-B_{0}/t}}{t}dt + \frac{1}{3}\beta_{0}T_{\rm min}^{3} + \frac{1}{3}\alpha_{0}T_{\rm min}^{5}\ .\]

(4) The entropy of the sample is then calculated for T > T_{\rm min} using experimental data and S_{\rm min}:

\[S(T) = S_{\rm min} + \sum_{i = 0}^{N - 1}\frac{1}{2}\,\left[\frac{C_{i}}{T_{i}}+\frac{C_{i +1}}{T_{i +1}}\right](T_{i +1} - T_{i})\ .\]

(5) The S(T) obtained from step (4) is then used to recalculate the parameters \alpha and \beta using

\[C_{V_{n}}(T) - S_{n}(T) = \frac{2}{3}\beta T^{3} + \frac{4}{3}\alpha T^{5}\]

at each temperature experimentally investigated. A linear, least-squares fit of (C_{V_{n}} - S_{n})T^{-3} versus T^{2} yields new values of \alpha and \beta as input for step (2) above.

(6) The steps (2)-(5) are repeated, yielding new values of A, B, and S_{\rm min}, until all parameters converge to within 0.1%.

(7) The value of \gamma^{\star} is determined from the final results of step (6) using

\[\gamma^{\star}T = S_{n}(T) - \frac{1}{3}\beta T^{3} - \frac{1}{3}\alpha T^{5}\ .\]

The thermodynamic critical field can be calculated from

\[\frac{1}{8\pi}[H_{C}^{2}(T) - H_{c}^{2}(0)] = - V_{m}^{-1}\int_{0}^{T}\Delta S(t)dt\ ,\]

where V_{m} is the molar volume,

\[\frac{H_{c}^{2}(0)}{8\pi} = V_{m}^{-1}\int_{0}^{T_{c}}\Delta S(t)dt\ ,\]

\[\Delta S(T) = \gamma^{\star}T + \frac{1}{3}\beta T^{3} + \frac{1}{3}\alpha T^{5} - S(T)\ ,\]

and S(T) is taken from the final iteration's results in Eq. (9).

Several elementary models of superconductivity predict the following approximate form for H_{c}(T) at T < \kern-1.0pt\lower 0.43pt\hbox{$<$}\kern-1.0pt\lower 3.01pt\hbox{$\sim$}\,T_{c} (Ref. [25]):

\[H_{c}(T) = H_{c}(0)[1 - (T/T_{c})^{2}]\ .\]

The results of Eq. (12) were fitted to Eq. (15) using the method of least squares. The best-fit value of H_{c}(0) was then compared to that obtained from the experimental data using the low-temperature extrapolation of Eq. (7) with Eq. (13).

  

### Phonon moment method

Analytical techniques for extracting important information from the lattice specific-heat data for metals have appeared in recent years.[26, 27] These are particularly useful in the case of superconductors since the traditional electron-phonon interaction mechanism for superconductivity implies that important physical parameters such as T_{c}, \Delta, and \lambda will depend upon the phonon and electronic densities of states. These techniques can be invaluable in situations where inelastic electron tunneling or neutron scattering measurements are difficult or impossible to make. Further, recent model calculations for strong-coupled superconductors have demonstrated that T_{c}'s can be quantitatively estimated from a knowledge of various frequency moments (\omega^{n}) of the phonon spectrum.[26]^{-}[28]

The (\omega^{n}) are defined in terms of the phonon density of states F(\omega) by

\[\langle\,\omega^{n}\,\rangle=\int\omega^{n}F(\omega)\,d\omega\ ,\] (16)

which is an expression that is difficult to compare with experiment. However, it can be shown that the (\omega^{n}) can be directly obtained from lattice heat-capacity data without resort to detailed measurements of phonon dispersion curves.[29] Some of the superconducting properties can then be calculated with the aid of the Allen-Dynes formula:[28]

\[T_{c}=\frac{f_{1}f_{2}}{1.20}\omega_{\rm log}\exp\,\left[\frac{1.04(1+\lambda) }{\mu^{\bullet}+0.62\lambda\mu^{\bullet}-\lambda}\,\right]\ .\] (17)

Here, the parameter \omega_{\rm log} is a characteristic phonon scaling frequency given by

\[\omega_{\rm log}=\exp\,\left[\frac{2}{\lambda}\int\alpha^{2}F(\omega)\ln\omega \,d\,\ln\omega\,\right]\ ,\] (18)

and the electron-phonon coupling \lambda is calculated from

\[\lambda=2\int\alpha^{2}F(\omega)\,d\,\ln\omega\ .\] (19)

\omega_{\rm log} cannot be directly calculated from heat-capacity data without making additional assumptions concerning the frequency dependence of the electron-phonon spectral function \alpha^{2}F(\omega). Fortunately, previous experiments and analyses[28] have shown that \omega_{\rm log}\approx\overline{\omega}_{\rm log}, where

\[\overline{\omega}_{\rm log}\equiv\exp\,\left[\frac{\int F(\omega)\ln\omega\,d \,\ln\omega}{\int F(\omega)\,d\,\ln\omega}\,\right]\ .\] (20)

**A** schematic form for F(\omega) can be obtained by fitting the frequency moments obtained from heat-capacity data to the following expression:

\[\langle\,\omega^{n}\,\rangle=\frac{\int F(\omega)\,\omega^{n}\,d\omega}{\int F (\omega)\,d\,\omega}\ .\] (21)

**Note** that a customary normalization sets \int F(\omega)\,d\omega=1. Using the facts that the functions f_{1} and f_{2} are near unity for \lambda\lesssim 1.5, and the Coulomb pseudopotential \mu^{\bullet}\approx 0.1 for transition metals, one obtains a reasonably quantitative relation between T_{c}, \lambda, and the heat-capacity data:

\[T_{c}\,\frac{\overline{\omega}_{\rm log}}{1.2}\exp\,\left[\frac{1.04(1+\lambda )}{\mu^{\bullet}+0.62\lambda\mu^{\bullet}-\lambda}\,\right]\ .\] (22)

Although there are no particular assumptions which must be made concerning the detailed behavior of F(\omega), in practice it is sufficient to assume a four- to six-parameter model spectrum of the form

\[F(\omega)=\sum_{i}D_{i}F_{D}(\omega/\theta_{i})\ ,\] (23)

where F_{D} is an elementary Debye spectrum characterized by a "partial Debye temperature" \theta_{i} (Ref. [27]):

\[F_{D}(\omega/\theta_{i})=\begin{cases}3\omega^{2}\theta_{i}^{-3},&\omega\leq \theta_{i}\\ 0,&\omega>\theta_{i}\ .\end{cases}\] (24)

The fitting procedure is constrained by the normalization condition \sum D_{i}=1 (equivalent to the fact that the high-temperature lattice heat capacity \to 3R ), and the entropy constraint on the electronic heat capacity at T_{c}. This procedure has been found to yield values of \langle\,\omega^{n}\,\rangle and \overline{\omega}_{\rm log} that compare favorably with the results of tunneling and neutron scattering experiments for A15 compounds.[30, 31] The procedure is initially aided by the fact that [C(T)-\gamma^{\bullet}T]T^{-3} is an approximate image of the spectral weight D(\omega)-\omega^{-2}F(\omega) for \overline{\pi}\omega=5k_{B}T (Refs. [27, 29, and 30]). The rms deviations of the data from the best-fit model heat capacities derived from Eq. (23) are \sim 1\%.

The phonon moment method we have used is subject to a number of important assumptions. All of the contributions to C_{P_{B}}(T) except the electronic term \gamma^{\bullet}T are assumed to be phononic in origin; otherwise, our procedure may be viewed as a convenient way to analyze the normal-state data over a wide temperature range [where Eq. (3) fails] using only a small number of adjustable parameters. The assumption of a composite Debye spectrum for F(\omega) ignores anharmonicity. However, considerably more detail and additional assumptions must be incorporated into this type of analysis in order to approximate anharmonic effects,[26, 32] and we have neglected them in the fitting procedure.

## IV Experimental results and analysis

The experimental data for C_{P}T^{-1} are plotted versus T^{2} for each of the U_{\phi}X compounds in Figs. 1 and 2. There is marked nonlinear character in these plots at T\geq 5 K, as shown in Fig. 3. This behavior implies that a high density of low-energy excitations (e.g., "soft" phonons or paramagnons) dominates the heat capacity of these materials. The strong negative curvature at modest temperatures in C_{P}T^{-1} versus T^{2} is very similar to the data for high-T_{c}, high-H_{c2}, A 15, and Chevrel phase materials.[26, 30, 33] However, the overall magnitudes of the heat capacities of the U_{\phi}X compounds are several times larger than many high-T_{c} materials, and are more than an order of magnitude larger than those of simple metals such as Cu.[5, 22, 23]

### Polynomial analysis

Extreme care must be exercised in the use of the polynomial ("POLY") method to extract physical parameters relevant to the U_{\phi}X materials. Specifically, the POLY analysis must be restricted to a narrow temperature interval above T_{c} where the curvature of C_{P_{h}}T^{-1} versus T^{2} is relatively insignificant. The best-fit parameters from the POLY analysis of the normal- and superconducting-state data are summarized in Table 2.

Comparisons of the experimental data and the best-fit predictions of Eqs. (3) and (6) are given in Fig. 3. We note that the transition anomaly at T_{c} is relatively broad in the case of U_{6}Mn. This is probably due to the poorer quality of U used in preparing this sample and the relatively high vapor pressure of Mn in the melt. Peculiarities in the metallurgy and lattice parameters of U_{6}Mn have been noted earlier.[8, 20] Unfortunately, a significant transition width introduces uncertainties in the estimation of the jump \Delta C_{P}(T_{c}) in heat capacity at T_{c} and the intrinsic behavior of H_{c}(T), not to mention T_{c} itself.

We have defined a calorimetric width 8T_{c} of the transition by noting the temperatures of the peak in C_{P_{h}} and the intersection of the extrapolations of C_{P_{h}} (given by the parameters of Table 2) and the quasilinear-T region of the transition anomaly. A minimum value \Delta C_{P}^{min} of \Delta C_{P}(T_{c}) can be estimated from the difference in C_{P_{h}} at the peak of the anomaly and C_{P_{h}} near the onset of the transition anomaly. This number can be compared to an "ideal" value, \Delta C_{P}^{ideal} determined by extrapolating C_{P_{h}}(T<T_{c}) and C_{P_{h}}(T>T_{c}) into the transition region. An estimate T_{c}(can) for T_{c} is obtained from a graphical analysis of a C_{P}T^{-1} versus T plot. T_{c}(can) is adjusted until the entropy difference \Delta S(T) [see Eq. (14)] estimated from the actual data near T_{c}(can) and an idealized, sharp transition anomaly at T_{c}(can), are equal.

Additional estimates of T_{c} can be extracted from fits of H_{c}(T) to the "parabolic law" of Eq. (15) (yielding "T_{c}^{phn}), and by extrapolating the calculated values of H_{c}(T) and

Figure 3: Heat capacity C_{P} divided by temperature T vs T^{2} for U_{\phi}X (X = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) compounds. Experimental data are represented by the points, and fits of the data by the polynomial method are represented by the lines. Details of the fit parameters are given in Table 2. The polynomial method provides an excellent fit for the normal-state U_{\phi}Fe data for T\leq 10 K, whereas the method is successful only for T\leq 5.5 K in the case of the other compounds.

Figure 2: Heat capacity C_{P} divided by temperature T vs T^{2} for U_{6}Mn and U_{6}Ni.

 \Delta S(T) [from Eqs. (12) and (14)] to H_{c} or \Delta S=0 at "T_{c}^{th}." Additional parameters, chiefly relevant to the superconducting state, are collected in Table 3. The data for \Delta C_{P}(T_{c})/\gamma^{\star}T_{c} show evidence for strong coupling (compared to a BCS value of 1.43), particularly in the case of U_{6}Fe.

Measurements of the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(T) can also provide additional information concerning the coupling strength and the quality of the fits. Plots of H_{c}(T) versus T, as calculated from Eq. (12), are shown in Fig. 4. Various parameters concerning H_{c}(T) are summarized in Table 4. The tabulated values of the ratio H_{c}^{2}(0)/\gamma^{\star}T_{c}^{2} are to be compared to the BCS ratio, 5.94. These ratios corroborate the evidence for strong-coupling renormalizations of \Delta C_{P}(T_{c})/\gamma^{\star}T_{c} values listed in Table 3: U_{6}Mn appears to be BCS-like, while U_{6}Co is moderately strong coupled and U_{6}Fe is substantially strong coupled. The close agreement between various estimates of T_{c} and H_{c}(0) for each compound indicates that the fitting procedure is satisfactory. However, we note that the relatively poor quality of the U_{6}Mn sample is clearly reflected in the strong positive curvature of H_{c}(T) near a poorly-defined T_{c}.

Another check of the fitting procedure can be made by comparing the low-temperature behavior of the superconducting-state data C_{P_{x}} to the extrapolation formula of Eq. (6). We define the electronic contribution to the superconducting-state heat capacity by

\[C_{es}=C_{P_{x}}-\beta T^{3}-\alpha T^{5}\ .\] (25)

Plots of \ln[C_{es}/\gamma^{\star}T_{c}] versus T_{c}/T for U_{6}Mn, U_{6}Fe, and U_{6}Co are shown in Fig. 5. These data can be compared to BCS model predictions where

\[\frac{C_{es}}{\gamma^{\star}T_{c}}\approx 8.5\exp(-1.44T_{c}/T)\] (26)

for 2.5\la T_{c}/T\la 6 (Ref. 25). Comparisons of the data of

  Fig. 5 to fits using Eq. (26) are also shown in Fig. 5.

The precise form of the temperature dependence of the superconducting energy gap D(_T_) may cause deviations from Eq. (26) near T_{c}, and gap anisotropy or strong-coupling effects may cause additional deviations at very low temperatures.[25, 34, 35] The data for U6Mn and U6Co are well fitted by Eq. (26) to rather high temperatures [outside the expected range of validity of Eq. (26)], and U6Fe exhibits a BCS-like behavior over the expected temperature range. The quality and self-consistency of the fits using Eq. (6) are strongly supported by the results shown in Fig. 5. Lower-temperature measurements of C_{p_{\rm{s}}} for U6X compounds would be desirable in view of recent claims[36, 37] that the non-BCS behavior of C_{es} in UBe_{13} provides clear evidence for triplet pairing.

### Phonon moment analysis

Results of the fits of the heat-capacity data of U6X compounds over a wide temperature range using the phonon moment ("MOM") analysis are summarized in Table 5. Plots of C_{p}T^{-1} versus T are shown in Fig. 6, along with the behavior calculated for selected "best" fits. The parameters relevant to the model curves shown in Fig. 6 are collected in Table 6. The agreement between the values of \gamma^{\star} and \Theta_{D} from the POLY analysis (see Table 2) and the average values of \gamma^{\star} and \Theta(\textit{T}\to 0) from the MOM analysis (see Table 5) is excellent.

Our analyses indicate that the small, systematic differences between the corresponding parameters given in Tables 2 and 5 are primarily due to differing estimates of S_{\rm{min}} [see Eq. (8)] obtained in the two methods used to fit the data. S_{\rm{min}} is estimated in the MOM method by fitting the first 5-10 superconducting-state data at \textit{T}\!>\!T_{\rm{min}} to a form C_{s}\!=\!\xi T^{3}\!+\!\eta T^{5}, yielding S_{\rm{min}}\!=\!\frac{1}{3}\xi T_{\rm{min}}^{3}\!+\!\eta T_{\rm{min}}^{5}. This procedure will generally overestimate S_{\rm{min}}, leading to systematically higher \gamma^{\star} values compared to the POLY method. Note also that the POLY method gives a much stronger weight to lower-temperature data due to the reduced size of the fitting interval and strict enforcement of the entropy constraint at T_{c}. The MOM method treats all of the data with equal weight. Additional calculations of T_{c} and H_{c}(\textit{T}) within the MOM analysis are in excellent agreement with the POLY results quoted earlier and will not be detailed here.

The _qualitative_ nature (e.g., the relative weight of low-frequency modes) of the D(\omega)\!\sim\!\omega^{-2}F(\omega) required to fit the heat-capacity data for the U6X samples can be inferred from our analyses; whereas it is important to note that several _quantitatively_ different model F(\omega)'s have been shown previously to provide equally satisfactory fits of the data for A 15 materials.[30] Plots of \omega^{-2}F(\omega) are shown in Fig. 7, corresponding to the "best" fit models given in Fig. 6 and Table 6. Note that the higher-T_{c} U6Fe compound has significantly more weight in the low-frequency end of F(\omega) than the lower-T_{c} U6Ni material. It is interesting that experimental data for \gamma^{\star} and \Theta (\textit{T}\!\to\!0) roughly correlate and anticorrelate, respectively, with T_{c} in a number of transition metal materials.[30, 38, 39, 27] Such a trend presumably results from the increased renormalization of long-wavelength acoustic phonons that accompanies an increased electronic density of

  states.[26] Nevertheless, it is still surprising that such an effect could result in the fourfold to fivefold increase in the \beta coefficient of the T^{3} term of the lattice heat capacity noted in comparing the close analogues U_{6}Mn and U_{6}Fe, or U_{6}Ni and U_{6}Co.

  model fits of the electronic heat capacity. Further experiments, such as inelastic neutron scattering, would be useful to justify such an analysis.

Although the MOM fits to the U_{6}Mn and U_{6}Ni data are excellent over a wide range of temperature, there are significant discrepancies between the fits and the data at T \sim 25 K. This is particularly noticeable for U_{6}Ni (see Fig. 6), suggesting that it may be necessary to add Einstein modes to F(\omega) in order to reproduce the extreme negative curvature observed in C_{P}T^{-1} versus T^{2} at higher temperatures. However, the upper cutoffs (\theta_{3} in Table 6) are not uniquely defined when they are the same order as \sim 8T_{\rm max}, where T_{\rm max} is the maximum temperature achieved in the measurements. Higher-temperature data, especially for U_{6}Co and U_{6}Fe, are required to fully reveal the differences in behavior of the U_{6}_X_ compounds.

The C_{P}T^{-1} versus T plots of Fig. 3 emphasize the remarkable differences in low-temperature curvature of C_{P} between the closely analogous pairs of compounds, U_{6}Fe and U_{6}Mn, and U_{6}Co and U_{6}Ni. Such differences among analogous compounds have also been observed in Chevrel phases[33, 39] Mo_{6}Se_{6} (T_{c} = 6.3 K) and Mo_{6}S_{8} (T_{c} = 1.8 K). Although the magnitude of C_{P}(T) for the U_{6}_X_ materials is 1 order of magnitude greater than that of the Chevrel phases, the absolute differences in C_{P}T^{-1} between higher- and lower-T_{c} analogues are quite comparable for the two types of materials.

The large \gamma^{*} coefficients typically observed in heavy-fermion materials automatically lead to very high entropies at modest temperatures, as demanded by Eq. (1). It is reasonable to associate these large entropies with the presence of "quasilocalized" excitations arising from the hybridization of localized f states with itinerant conduction states.[40, 41] It has been pointed out[41] that so far the electronic entropy S_{e} has only been extracted from calorimetric data for two heavy-fermion compounds (UBe_{13} and U_{2}Zn_{17}) due to the limited availability of suitable analogue materials that are useful in approximating the lattice contribution C_{l}. However, it is still very difficult to clearly separate electronic and lattice contributions to the heat capacity, even when suitable analogue compounds (which display a Debye behavior over a significant temperature interval) are available.[42] Recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements[43, 44] on UBe_{13} and UPt_{3} have provided more direct means for deducing C_{l}, and surprisingly, these data show no evidence for a "strong coupling" (e.g., phonon softening at low T) between the electron and lattice systems in these two materials.

The four U_{6}_X_ compounds constitute a unique system of analogues exhibiting reasonably large effective masses and an \sim 50% variation in \gamma^{*}. It is, therefore, of particular interest to compare the variations of the low-temperature S_{e} of these compounds. A plot of the total entropies S(T) for U_{6}Mn and U_{6}Fe are shown in Fig. 8. Note that by T \approx 15 K an entropy difference of \sim 2 J/mol K \sim 0.35R ln2 has been established between these compounds. A similar plot, including U_{6}Mn, U_{6}Co, and U_{6}Ni, is shown in Fig. 9. An entropy difference of \sim 0.45R ln2 is established between U_{6}Co and U_{6}Ni by T \approx 13 K. Note also that these entropy differences appear to saturate with increasing temperature by \sim 15 K, although this conclusion is based on a somewhat limited data set. These entropy differences are remarkable, even if they are normalized to the U concentration. Unfortunately, there is no Th-based, non-5f (and therefore low-\gamma^{*}) analogue available for such comparisons. Higher-temperature heat capacity and low-temperature inelastic neutron scattering data would be desirable in order to better quantify these results and confirm the saturation of the entropy differences between various U_{6}_X_ compounds.

The low-temperature behavior of C_{P}(T) for the U_{6}_X_ compounds can be discussed from yet another interesting point of view. DeLong _et al.[12]_ reported that the

The curves were calculated using the POLY method, as described in the text.

  normal-state heat capacity of U_{6}Fe exhibited an unusual T^{2} behavior over the temperature range 4\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,T\, \raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,20 K, as shown in Fig. 10. The solid line in Fig. 10 corresponds to a temperature dependence T^{\ast} with n=2.06.

A T^{2} dependence of the _lattice_ heat capacity C_{l} has previously been observed in high-T_{c}A\,15 compounds such as Nb_{3}Sn and Nb_{3}Al by Webb _et al._, [45] and was correlated with a strong T^{2} dependence of the electrical resistivity over a similar temperature interval. Webb _et al._ proposed a model phonon density of states F(\omega) that simultaneously reproduced the behavior of both C_{l}(T) and the T^{2} term of the resistivity, suggesting that it arose from electron-phonon scattering in the presence of a high density of low-energy phonon modes. T^{2} terms in the low-temperature (T< 5 K) resistivities of U_{6}Fe and U_{6}Co have been recently observed. [46]

We have intensified our interest in the T^{2} behavior of U_{6}Fe in view of recent observations [47] of a very low-temperature T^{2} dependence of C_{P}(T) for the heavy-fermion material, CeAl_{3}. We anticipated that U_{6}Co might also display a T^{2} character to C_{P}(T) due to this compound's high \gamma^{\ast} and strong low-frequency weight in F(\omega) (see Fig. 7). Indeed, we have found T^{2} behavior, but within two separate temperature intervals, 8 K \,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,T\, \raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,13 K and 2 K \,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,T\, \raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,5 K; We also note that C_{P}(T) roughly varies as T^{\ast} with n\approx2.14 in the interval 5 K \,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,T\, \raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,13 K, demonstrating that the approximate variation of C_{P}(T) is close to T^{2} over the entire normal-state range investigated, 2.3 K \,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,T\, \raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,13 K.

Plots of C_{P} versus T^{2} are given in Fig. 11 for U_{6}Fe, U_{6}Co, and U_{6}Mn. C_{P} of U_{6}Mn only roughly follows a T^{2} dependence for 10 K \,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,T\, \raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,20 K. If we demand that the total C_{P}(T) be described by a "simple T^{2\ast} law that intersects the origin, we find that U_{6}Fe obeys such a law at all experimental temperatures T\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$>$}\,T_{c}, U_{6}Co satisfies the law less well for T\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$>$}\,T_{c}, and U_{6}Mn follows such a dependence only for T\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$>$}\,14 K. Alternatively, we observe that the region of T^{2} behavior may shift to higher temperatures as \gamma^{\ast} decreases. We note that Webb _et al._[45] observed nonzero intercepts for extrapolations of the T^{2} regions of C_{l}(T) for A\,15 compounds.

We wish to emphasize that the difficulty in separating the lattice and electronic contributions to C_{P}(T) makes it dangerous to attribute low-energy structure in the experimentally deduced F(\omega) to phonon excitations alone, although this certainly cannot be ruled out. It is possible that a T^{2} behavior of C_{P}(T) may be an artifact of high-\gamma^{\ast} materials for which a clear separation of the lattice contribution is most suspect. For example, we have found that the Mo_{6}Se_{8} and Mo_{6}S_{8} data of Ref. [33] do not exhibit a T^{2} phenomenon. This may be associated with the fact that \gamma^{\ast}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,2.6 \times 10^{3} erg/cm^{3} K^{2} for these two Chevrel phases, [33, 39] 1 order of magnitude smaller than

  the \gamma^{\bullet} of the U_{6}_X_ compounds. On the other hand, we find that the data of Junod _et al_.[48] for the pseudobinary A 15 Ti_{75}Ir_{20}Pt_{5} do follow a _T_^{2} dependence (as shown in Fig. 12); and this material has a \gamma^{\bullet}\!\approx\!9\times\!10^{3} erg/cm^{3} K^{2}, more comparable to the U_{6}_X_ and high-_T__{c}_A_ 15 compounds.

Measurements of C_{P}(T) were also carried out in applied magnetic-field strengths of 2 kOe in the case of U_{6}Fe and U_{6}Co, and the results are shown in Figs. 13 and 14. There is no apparent field-induced change in the data, save the small reductions in T_{c} and \Delta C, for a 2 kOe field. Calorimetric determinations of the initial slope of the upper critical field H^{\prime}_{c2}(T) were made taking care to idealize the transition anomaly in such a manner as to comply with the entropy constraint at T_{c}. The results are H^{\prime}_{c2}(T)\!=\!-3.64 T/K and -3.33 T/K for U_{6}Fe and U_{6}Co, respectively. Resistive measurements [12, 13] on the same U_{6}Fe sample II-33 have yielded H^{\prime}_{c2}(T_{c})\!=\!-3.42 T/K. Menovsky _et al_.[49] have measured the heat capacity of U_{6}Co in applied fields of 0 to 5 T (in 1 T steps), and found H^{\prime}_{c2}(T_{c})\!=\!-3.77/K, T_{c}(H\!=\!0)\!=\!2.3 K and \gamma^{\bullet}(H\!=\!0)\!=\!126 mJ/mol K^{2}, all in very good agreement with our results. DeLong _et al_.[50] have resistively measured two different U_{6}Co samples and found H^{\prime}_{c2}(T_{c})\!=\!-3.3 T/K and -3.9 T/K.

The relatively large transition width observed for the U_{6}Mn sample II-46 was attributed to impurities in the U starting materials, and it was therefore useful to measure the magnetic susceptibility of this sample in order to check for temperature-dependent paramagnetism or ferromagnetic impurity phases. Data for the magnetization \sigma were taken at several temperatures. The susceptibility \chi^{\bullet}, defined by the slope of \sigma versus H, was found to be temperature independent for 6 K \leq T\!\leq\!240 K, but a small remanence developed at T\!\leq\!120 K. This is confirmed in the plot of \sigma/H versus T in a fixed field H\!=\!2.0 T, as shown in Fig. 15. The value of \sigma/H\!=\!3.1\times\!10^{-3} cm^{3}/mol at T\!=\!6 K is in excellent agreement with the results of DeLong _et al_.[5] Sample II-46 exhibits about 1 order of magnitude less remanence than their data for U_{6}Fe sample II-33, suggesting that there were not abnormally large amounts of ferromagnetic phases present in our U_{6}Mn sample.

## V Discussion of results

We now turn to a discussion of possible interpretations of our heat-capacity data. The unusually high values of \gamma^{\bullet} and the evidence for a high density of low-energy excitations in the U_{6}_X_ compounds imply that simple models and traditional interpretations for these data should be regarded with caution. In view of the probable strong 5f contributions to the electronic density of states of these materials, several phenomenological models that recently have been applied to heavy-fermion systems are discussed below.

### Fermi-liquid approach

Several arguments [40, 51, 52] have been given that imply the superconductivity in heavy-fermion metals should be of an odd-parity type mediated by the exchange of paramagnons. Given that liquid ^{3}He is an exchange-enhanced, triplet-paired superfluid that can also be described as "nearly localized", [53]^{-}[55] Fermi-liquid theory has frequently been used to compare heavy-fermion superconductors to ^{3}He. Many of these approaches should be carefully distinguished from the microscopic "paramagnon model" [56, 57] for exchange-enhanced metals and ^{3}He. Our heat-capacity results have already been used [5] to analyze magnetic susceptibility data for the U_{6}X compounds in terms of the paramagnon model, and this approach will not be discussed further. We will instead compare our results to recent applications of Landau Fermi-liquid theory to the heavy-fermion problem. The reader is referred to Refs. [41] and [58] for reviews of these techniques.

We are specifically interested in comparing our heat-capacity data with model predictions of the superconducting transition temperature and pairing symmetry. We use the weak-coupling calculation of T_{c} by Patton and Zaringhalam [59] as outlined by Pethick and Pines. [58] The normal-state properties are described by the symmetric (s) and antisymmetric (a) Landau parameters

\[A_{l}^{s,a} = \frac{F_{l}^{s,a}}{1 + F_{l}^{s,a}/(2l + 1)}\ \ .\] (27)

We assume the forward-scattering sum rule is satisfied in the "sp approximation:" [60]

\[\sum_{l = 0}^{1}\left( \, A_{l}^{s} + A_{l}^{a} \right) = 0\ \ .\] (28)

The transition temperature is given in terms of a weak-coupling formula for pairing in a state of orbital angular momentum L = [l(l + 1)]^{1/2}\#:

\[^{\mu}T_{c} = 1.13\Theta_{c}\,\exp\left( \, 1/\lambda_{\mu} \right)\ ,\] (29)

where the pairing interaction strengths in the singlet (\mu \equiv 0) and triplet (\mu \equiv 1) channels are given by

\[\begin{array}{l} \lambda_{0} = \sum_{l}\,\frac{( - 1)^{l}}{4}\left( \, A_{l}^{s} - 3\, A_{l}^{a} \right)\ ,\\ \lambda_{1} = \sum_{l}\,\frac{( - 1)^{l}}{12}\left( \, A_{l}^{s} + A_{l}^{a} \right)\ .\end{array}\] (30)

\Theta_{c} is a cutoff that must satisfy ^{\mu}T_{c} \ll \Theta_{c} << T_{F}^{\bullet} in the weak-coupling limit. [41] Note that in the sp approximation the sums in Eq. (30) are taken only over l = 0,1, and \lambda_{\mu} must be less than zero for an attractive interaction and nonzero T_{c} to occur.

We will discuss our attempts to apply Eqs. (27)-(30) to our data using four different types of approximations. The first method was used by Valls and Tesanovic [61] in a direct application of the "almost localized" model of ^{3}He to heavy-fermion superconductors. The assumption of a large m^{\bullet}/m_{e} and incipient localization imply A_{l}^{s} \sim 3, A_{l}^{s} \sim 1, and A_{l}^{a} \sim - 3, and the sum rule [Eq. (30)] is used to obtain A_{l}^{a} = - 1. Equations (30) then yield \lambda_{0} = 1 and \lambda_{1} = - \frac{1}{3}, and thereby predict triplet superconductivity. It is customary [58] to reexpress \Theta_{c} in terms of either the Fermi or spin-fluctuation temperatures:

\[1.13\Theta_{c} = 8T_{F}^{\bullet} = \beta T_{\rm sf}\ .\] (31)

\delta and \beta are unknown scaling factors, and it is assumed that T_{sf} = (1 + F_{0}^{a})T_{F}^{\bullet}. [58] A summary of experimental parameters for the four U_{6}X compounds is given in Table 7, and a list of parameters derived from the "almost localized" model is given in Table 8.

The method used by Valls and Tesanovic suffers from several serious defects. It assumes Galilean invariance within the Fermi liquid and sets m^{\bullet}/m_{e} = 1 + F_{1}^{s}/3, implying A_{l}^{s} \sim 3 for heavy fermions. However, the Bloch symmetry of crystals invalidates the relation between m^{\bullet}/m_{e} and F_{1}^{s}. [41, 58] Further, the m^{\bullet} values of the U_{6}X compounds are roughly 1 order of magnitude less than those of UPt_{3} and UBe_{13}, and the assumption of A_{l}^{s} \sim 3 is probably not justified in our case.

A second method, which we label the "induced interaction" approach, [58, 62, 63] relies on a general treatment of the Landau interaction function in the case of a short-range potential between quasiparticles. [64, 65] We assume A_{0}^{s} \sim 1 for a charged Fermi liquid, [58] and the effective mass is given by

\[m^{\bullet}/m_{b} = 1 + F_{1}^{s}/3\ ,\] (32)

where m_{b} is the quasiparticle mass in the absence of "backflow," [62, 63] and contains renormalizations due to band structure and the electron-phonon interaction. The quasiparticle mass m_{b} can be measured in the superconducting state via observation of the London penetration depth. [63] The essential point is that this approach does not rely on Galilean invariance of the Fermi liquid. Unfortunately, the practical application of the model is best achieved by fixing F_{0}^{a} and A_{0}^{a} with the T^{3}\ln T contribution to C_{P}, such as is possible in the case of ^{3}He, UPt_{3}, and UAl_{2}. [58] Since very few materials unambiguously exhibit the T^{3}\ln T term (the U_{6}X compounds evidently do not), one must adopt another means of fixing F_{0}^{a}.

We have chosen to relate F_{0}^{a} to the "R ratio" for a spin-\frac{1}{2} Fermi liquid:

\[R = \frac{1}{3}\,\left[ \frac{\pi k_{B}}{\mu_{B}} \right]^{2}\frac{X^{\bullet}(T \to 0)}{\gamma^{\bullet}}\sim(1 + F_{0}^{a})^{-1}\ .\] (33)

The validity of this relation has been discussed [5] in ap

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c}  & T_{c} & & k_{F}a & & T_{F}^{\bullet}a \\ Compound & (K) & R & (108 cm−1) & m^{\bullet}/m_{e}a & (K) \\ \hline U_{6}Mn & 2.21 & 2.2 & 1.56 & 15 & 7200 \\ U_{6}Fe & 3.70 & 1.4 & 1.57 & 23 & 4690 \\ U_{6}Co & 2.29 & 1.5 & 1.57 & 20 & 5540 \\ U_{6}Ni & 0.35 & 2.4 & 1.565 & 13.5 & 8020 \\ \end{tabular}

 plication to heavy-fermion systems. The major risks in using Eq. (33) stem from its omission of band-structure and spin-orbit effects on the magnetic susceptibility \chi^{\star}. However, these approximations are certainly consistent with those used in the majority of Fermi-liquid models.[41]

The "induced interaction" approach yields, in the case of U_{6}Fe, \lambda_{1}\!=\!0.1, thereby precluding a triplet pairing state, and \lambda_{0}\!=\!0.1\!-\!A^{\,\dagger}_{1}. A^{\,\dagger}_{1} cannot be determined from Eq. (32) without knowledge of m_{b}. Assuming 1\!\leq\!m_{b}/m_{e}\!\lesssim\!14, we deduce 1.2\!\lesssim\!A^{\,\dagger}_{1}\!\lesssim\!2.9 and -2.8\!\lesssim\!\lambda_{0}\!\lesssim\!-1.1. However, these parameters imply 4.7\!\lesssim\!\Theta_{c}\!\lesssim\!  pounds (triplet T_{c}'s are extremely low, whenever \lambda_{1}\!<\!0), although these materials appear to be near a crossover to the triplet state. Note also that the values of \Theta_{c} for the U_{d}_X_ compounds justify the weak-coupling formula, and that \Theta_{c}\!<\!\!<\!T_{sf}, suggesting that paramagnon pairing is "cut off"[51] by a lower-energy excitation such as phonons.

Several caveats to the above Fermi-liquid analyses should be mentioned. Band-structure effects arising from a breakdown of Galilean invariance lead to a "bare band mass" and orbital contributions to \chi^{\star} that either have been neglected or only roughly approximated in our analyses. Spin-orbit and anisotropy effects are also omitted, and the weak coupling Eq. (29) should not be trusted for calculation of accurate values of relevant parameters.[41] The parameters k_{F}, m^{\star}, and T_{F}^{\star} are also uncertain since they depend upon a proper choice of the fermion density n, which is not easily determined from independent measurements. Pethick and Pines[57] and DeLong[67] have given phenomenological arguments for assuming that each U atom contributes three "heavy fermions" (other contributions to n are neglected). We have adopted this assumption given the lack of direct experimental measurements of n and our desire to express our results within a common convention used by other authors.

In spite of the many approximations that one is forced to make in the application of Fermi-liquid theory, the various models discussed above generally yield quite reasonable values for the Landau parameters and associated quantities. At present there is no accepted microscopic model for heavy-fermion metals, and it is therefore useful to compare the Fermi-liquid properties of the U_{b}_X_ compounds to those of related materials. We believe that the relative trends and semiquantitative results given in Table 9 have physical significance.

### Strong-coupling analysis

The results of the Fermi-liquid analyses suggest that even-parity superconductivity due to the usual electron-phonon interaction is probably appropriate to the U_{b}_X_ compounds. The large size of the specific-heat jump at T_{c} and the zero-temperature thermodynamic critical field for U_{b}Co and U_{b}Fe (see Tables 3 and 4) imply that our results should be analyzed with a theoretical model that takes into account strong-coupling effects. We have accordingly compared our data to the Allen-Dynes model[28] in order to extract values of the electron-phonon coupling \lambda [see Eq. (19)] and the band-structure density of states N_{b}(E_{F}) given by

\[N_{b}(E_{F})\!=\!\frac{N^{\star}(E_{F})}{1\!+\!\lambda}=\frac{3\gamma^{\star} }{2\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}(1\!+\!\lambda)}\ \ .\] (35)

\lambda must be deduced from the T_{c} formula [Eq. (17)] using the approximation \omega_{\rm log}\!\approx\!\overline{\omega}_{\rm log} [see Eqs. (18) and (20)] and the functions f_{1} and f_{2} defined by

\[f_{1}\!=\![1\!+\!(\lambda/\Lambda_{1})^{3/2}]^{1/3}\] (36)

and

\[f_{2}\!=\!1\!+\!\frac{\lambda^{2}(\overline{\omega}_{2}/\omega_{\rm log}\!- \!1)}{\lambda^{2}\!+\!\Lambda_{2}^{2}}\ \ ,\] (37)

where

\[\Lambda_{1}\!=\!2.46(1\!  proximately double that of the higher-T_{c}_A_15's (Refs. [30] and [68]) and is comparable to that of U_{6}Fe.[12] The evidence for a strong Pauli limiting of H_{c2} for V_{3}Ga (Ref. [68]) suggests that paramagnons may be the appropriate mechanism responsible for the suppression of the superconducting properties of this compound. Indeed, phenomenological arguments[67, 71] imply that magnetic interactions strongly suppress superconductivity for N^{\bullet}(E_{F}) values slightly larger than those observed for the U_{6}_X_ and V_{3}Ga compounds.

However, applying the same line of reasoning to the U_{6}_X_ materials does not yield a straightforward explanation of their anomalous properties. In particular, no clear evidence has yet been found that the H_{c2} of U_{6}Fe is at all Pauli limited; indeed, the temperature dependences of H_{c2} for U_{6}Fe and U_{6}Co exhibit unusual positive curvature and low-temperature values that are significantly _greater_ than expected.[46, 50] Further, one must also simultaneously explain why lower T_{c}'s and _larger_ values of the susceptibility enhancement ratio R are correlated with _smaller_N^{\bullet}(E_{F}) in these materials[71] (see Tables VII and X). Note that considerable difficulties have been encountered in explaining similar effects in A15 materials.[68]

We have neglected exotic or complex contributions to the heat capacity in our analyses. It is possible that anharmonic corrections (e.g., "phonon softening") can account for the unusual behavior of the U_{6}_X_ materials, as has been suggested for A15 materials.[26, 72] Subtle low-temperature phase transitions[6, 73, 74] and polaronic[75, 76, 77, 78] effects are also possible mechanisms for anomalous behavior in these materials.

A complete analysis of the heat capacity of the U_{6}_X_ compounds, including a well-defined separation of the electronic and lattice contributions, may prove particularly difficult in view of the breakdown of adiabaticity inferred from the heat-capacity behavior of a number of narrow-band materials.[5, 67, 70, 71, 79] The properties of the U_{6}_X_ compounds and their incomplete parallels with A15 and Chevrel compounds remain enigmatic and deserve further study.

###### Abstract

Measurements of the superconducting- and normal-state heat capacity of U_{\phi}_X_ (_X_ = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) compounds have been performed over a temperature range 1 K \leq T\leq 35 K. The U_{\phi}_X_ compounds have strong renormalizations of the free-carrier effective mass m * in the range 10m_{e} \leq m * \leq 50m_{e} (m_{e} \equiv free-electron mass). The unusual magnitude and temperature dependence of the U_{\phi}_X_ heat capacities suggest the presence of high densities of low-energy excitations of undetermined nature. The results are analyzed in terms of models appropriate to heavy-fermion liquids, and anisotropic or strong-coupled superconductors. The U_{\phi}_X_ compounds form a link between relatively low-_m_ *, high-transition-temperature A15 compounds and the more extreme examples of heavy-fermion superconductors such as UBe_{13}, UPt_{13}, and CeCuSi_{2} for which m * \sim 10^{2}m_{e}.

## I Introduction

The U_{\phi}_X_ (_X_ \equiv Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) phases are among the earliest known U superconductors and include the first examples of superconducting Fe or Mn compounds.[1] In spite of their content of ferromagnetic 3d elements and strong paramagnetism,[2, 3, 4, 5] the highest-known upper critical magnetic field _H_{c2}_ and superconducting transition temperature _T_{c}_ for U compounds are observed within this class of materials.[6] Indeed, these compounds have long been cited as intriguing examples of the puzzling interplay between magnetism and superconductivity.[7, 8, 9, 10] Recently, U_{6}Fe was observed[11, 12, 13] to exhibit anomalous low-temperature properties that were attributed to "heavy fermions"[14] resulting from the hybridization between localized 5f and itinerant conduction electron states.[15]

Measurement of the low-temperature heat capacity has proven to be a very useful method of characterizing the strength and character of the many-body correlations between heavy-fermion quasiparticles.[16] The magnitude and temperature dependence of the low-temperature electronic contribution of the normal-state heat capacity reflect the magnitude of the fermion effective mass m * and low-energy structure in the quasiparticle density of states. Measurements at and below _T_{c}_ are crucial in proving the bulk nature of the superconducting state and provide useful constraints on parameters characterizing the heavy quasiparticles.[12, 13, 14]

We have performed measurements of the low-temperature heat capacity of the U_{\phi}_X_ (_X_ \equiv Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) compounds. Analyses of the resulting data indicate that these materials have strong renormalizations of the fermion mass in the range 10 \leq m * /m_{e} \leq 50 (m_{e} \equiv free-electron mass). The temperature dependences of the U_{\phi}_X_ heat capacities generally reflect the presence of a high density of low-energy excitations of undetermined nature. The data are consistent with a picture in which the U_{\phi}_X_ compounds are exchange-enhanced paramagnets that form a link between narrow-band transition metals--particularly high-_T_{c}_A_15 compounds--and heavy-fermion superconductors such as UBe_{13} (Ref. [17]) and UPt_{13}.[18]

## II Experimental details

Samples were prepared from high-purity starting materials by arc melting in a pure argon atmosphere. A Zr getter was melted several times, followed by several cycles of melting, turning, and remelting of the U-_X_ charge on a water-cooled copper hearth. A slight excess of U was used in the sample melt in order to suppress the amount of UX_{2} phase that is introduced in the peritectic formation of all of the U_{\phi}_X_ compounds.[19] After removal from the arc furnace, the samples were wrapped in Ta foil and sealed in evacuated quartz ampoules and annealed at temperatures just below the peritecites. Details of the sample preparation are summarized in Table 1.

Routine x-ray diffraction scans of the U_{6}Mn, U_{6}Co, and U_{6}Ni materials studied herein were conducted on unannealed powder samples. The diffraction peaks were broad and poorly resolved, but could be completely indexed in terms of the majority U_{\phi}Mn-type structure,[19] although a few weak peaks were explained as due to U oxides or C15-type, UMn_{2} (in the case of the U_{\phi}Mn sample, only) phase.[19] The short penetration depth of x rays in U compounds and the strain broadening expected in powder samples of the U6X phases [5] can account for the poor quality of the x-ray data. Broadening of the inductively measured superconducting transitions of unannealed powder samples of U6Mn, U6Co, and U6Ni (see Table 1) has also been observed.

Our U6Fe sample No. II-33 is the same one studied in the heat capacity, _H_c2, and electrical resistivity measurements reported in Refs. 11-13. X-ray diffraction and metallography studies were conducted on this sample with contributions by Roof and Pereyra of Los Alamos National Laboratory. Sample II-33 was found to be at least 95% single phase from x-ray measurements, although more sensitive metallography work detected small amounts of U oxide inclusions and excess U lodged at grain boundaries. [12, 13] Engelhardt [20] and White _et al._[21] have done extensive work on the effects of stoichiometry and annealing on the _T_c's of U_c_X compounds. A detailed discussion of impurity phases present in U6_c_X compounds is included in a report [5] of magnetization measurements on sample II-33 and other U6_c_X_ materials, and will not be discussed further here.

Heat-capacity measurements were performed using a semidatabic heat-pulse calorimeter with a mechanical heat switch. The calorimeter was attached to a 3He evaporation refrigerator providing an experimental temperature range 0.85 K  T  35 K in applied magnetic fields of zero and 2 kOe. Details of the methods used in analyzing the calorimetric data are given in Sec. III.

Magnetization measurements were performed on a section of the U6Mn sample II-46, only. An SHE (Biotechnologies, Inc.) magnetometer was used to cover the temperature range 2 K  T  300 K and applied magnetic fields  H  2.0 T. Demagnetization and anisotropy effects were neglected in these measurements and the associated analysis.

## III Methods of data analysis

The "strong form" of the third law of thermodynamics implies that the entropy S can be related to the constant-volume heat capacity C_{V} via

\[S(T) = \int_{0}^{T}\frac{{{\it C}_{V} }}{{{\it t}}}dt\ \ ,\]

where _S_(0)  = 0. Most experimental heat-capacity measurements, on the other hand, yield data for the constant-pressure heat capacity C_{P}. These results can, in principle, be used to calculate the more fundamental quantity C_{V} through the relation

\[C_{P} - C_{V} = {{\it V}T}\frac{{{\it\alpha}_{P}^2}}{{{\it\kappa}_T}}\ \ ,\]

where a_{P} is the isobaric thermal expansion coefficient and k_{T} is the isothermal compressibility. However, the difference between C_{P} and C_{V} is usually less than 1% for most metals below room temperature,22 and is generally neglected in the analysis of experimental results. We will therefore assume in this paper that our C_{P} data accurately reflect the behavior of C_{V}.

There are several methods of analysis which can be employed to extract important physical parameters from experimental heat capacity data for metals. We have chosen to apply two quite different methods that are reasonably representative of the more familiar models of the thermal behavior of superconductors. We will describe the strengths and weaknesses of each of these methods, and summarize and compare the numerical results that they yield.

### Polynomial method

The results of low-temperature normal-state heat-capacity measurements are frequently analyzed by fitting

  data to a low-power polynomial of the form

\[C_{Vn} = \gamma^{\star}T + \beta T^{3} + \alpha T^{5}\ .\]

\gamma^{\star} is the electronic coefficient given by

\[\gamma^{\star} = \frac{2\pi^{2}}{3}k_{B}^{2}N^{\star}(E_{F})\ ,\]

where N^{\star}(E_{F}) is the renormalized electronic density of states at the Fermi energy, and the coefficient \beta of the low-temperature phonon term is given by

\[\beta = \frac{12\pi^{4}N_{A}k_{B}n}{5\beta_{D}^{3}}\ ,\]

where N_{A} is Avogadro's number, \theta_{D} is the Debye temperature and n = number of atoms per formula unit. The \alpha coefficient is best considered as a fitting parameter that approximates finite-temperature corrections to the low-temperature behavior of the electron and lattice systems. Some care must be exercised in applying the model of Eqs. (3)-(5) to particular metals. Strictly speaking, Eq. (3) should not be applied at temperatures T > \kern-1.0pt\lower 0.43pt\hbox{$>$}\kern-1.0pt\lower 3.01pt\hbox{$\sim$}\theta_{D}/50 (Ref. [23]), or in situations where \gamma^{\star} is effectively "temperature dependent" as is the case in UPt3, UBe13, CeCu2Si2, and certain other heavy-fermion materials.16

Footnote 16: The \beta_{D} and \alpha_{D} parameters of the model are used to calculate the effective charge density of states at the Fermi energy.

Analyses performed on superconducting-state data must deal with the finite discontinuity \Delta C in heat capacity at T_{c}. This discontinuity is always broadened in laboratory situations due to the presence of coexisting normal and superconducting regions in imperfect sample materials within a temperature interval \Delta T_{c} about the ideal transition point. Therefore, we have chosen to initially integrate the experimental data according to Eq. (1) in order to obtain the superconducting-state entropy S_{s}(T). This procedure has several advantages. First, since the normal-state entropy S_{n} satisfies the relation S_{n}(T_{c}) = S_{s}(T_{c}), the errors introduced by fitting the _integrated_C_{V} data near T_{c} are minimal. Second, the entropy relation at T_{c} provides a useful constraint on the parameters derived from the fits of S_{n}(T) conducted over finite-temperature intervals. Third, the entropy difference \Delta S = S_{n}-S_{s} is also required in calculating the behavior of the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}. Of course, a realistic extrapolation of S_{s}(T) as T \to 0 is required, similar to the normal-state case.

The superconducting-state heat capacity is assumed to have the form [see the discussion of Eqs. (27) and (28)]

\[C_{V_{S}}=Ae^{-B/T} + \beta T^{3} + \alpha T^{5}\ .\]

We note that this form is not strictly valid (especially for strong-coupled materials), but should provide a reasonably accurate extrapolation of C_{V_{S}} in the absence of anomalous low-temperature behavior [such as observed for (U1_{- x}Th_{x})Be13 alloys (Ref. [24]).

An iterative method was employed to obtain self-consistent fits for both the normal- and superconducting-state data. The procedure can be broken down into several steps.

(1) "Zeroth-order" approximations \alpha = \alpha_{0} and \beta = \beta_{0} are obtained from fits of the data to Eq. (3) over limited temperature intervals extending above T_{c} where C_{V_{n}}T^{-1} versus T^{2} plots are nearly linear.

(2) The \beta_{0} and \alpha_{0} parameters of step (1) are used to calculate the electronic contributions C_{es} to C_{V_{S}} where

\[C_{es} \equiv A_{0}e^{-B_{0}/T} = C_{V_{S}} - \alpha_{0}T^{5} - \beta_{0}T^{3}\ .\]

A linear, least-squares fit of the processed data of lnC_{es} versus T^{-1} yields the parameters A_{0} and B_{0} for "zeroth order."

(3) The parameters \alpha_{c}, \beta_{0}, A_{0}, and B_{0} are then used to calculate the entropy for T = T_{\rm min}, the lowest measuring temperature:

\[S_{\rm min} = A_{0}\int_{0}^{T_{\rm min}}\frac{e^{-B_{0}/t}}{t}dt + \frac{1}{3}\beta_{0}T_{\rm min}^{3} + \frac{1}{3}\alpha_{0}T_{\rm min}^{5}\ .\]

(4) The entropy of the sample is then calculated for T > T_{\rm min} using experimental data and S_{\rm min}:

\[S(T) = S_{\rm min} + \sum_{i = 0}^{N - 1}\frac{1}{2}\,\left[\frac{C_{i}}{T_{i}}+\frac{C_{i +1}}{T_{i +1}}\right](T_{i +1} - T_{i})\ .\]

(5) The S(T) obtained from step (4) is then used to recalculate the parameters \alpha and \beta using

\[C_{V_{n}}(T) - S_{n}(T) = \frac{2}{3}\beta T^{3} + \frac{4}{3}\alpha T^{5}\]

at each temperature experimentally investigated. A linear, least-squares fit of (C_{V_{n}} - S_{n})T^{-3} versus T^{2} yields new values of \alpha and \beta as input for step (2) above.

(6) The steps (2)-(5) are repeated, yielding new values of A, B, and S_{\rm min}, until all parameters converge to within 0.1%.

(7) The value of \gamma^{\star} is determined from the final results of step (6) using

\[\gamma^{\star}T = S_{n}(T) - \frac{1}{3}\beta T^{3} - \frac{1}{3}\alpha T^{5}\ .\]

The thermodynamic critical field can be calculated from

\[\frac{1}{8\pi}[H_{C}^{2}(T) - H_{c}^{2}(0)] = - V_{m}^{-1}\int_{0}^{T}\Delta S(t)dt\ ,\]

where V_{m} is the molar volume,

\[\frac{H_{c}^{2}(0)}{8\pi} = V_{m}^{-1}\int_{0}^{T_{c}}\Delta S(t)dt\ ,\]

\[\Delta S(T) = \gamma^{\star}T + \frac{1}{3}\beta T^{3} + \frac{1}{3}\alpha T^{5} - S(T)\ ,\]

and S(T) is taken from the final iteration's results in Eq. (9).

Several elementary models of superconductivity predict the following approximate form for H_{c}(T) at T < \kern-1.0pt\lower 0.43pt\hbox{$<$}\kern-1.0pt\lower 3.01pt\hbox{$\sim$}\,T_{c} (Ref. [25]):

\[H_{c}(T) = H_{c}(0)[1 - (T/T_{c})^{2}]\ .\]

The results of Eq. (12) were fitted to Eq. (15) using the method of least squares. The best-fit value of H_{c}(0) was then compared to that obtained from the experimental data using the low-temperature extrapolation of Eq. (7) with Eq. (13).

  

### Phonon moment method

Analytical techniques for extracting important information from the lattice specific-heat data for metals have appeared in recent years.[26, 27] These are particularly useful in the case of superconductors since the traditional electron-phonon interaction mechanism for superconductivity implies that important physical parameters such as T_{c}, \Delta, and \lambda will depend upon the phonon and electronic densities of states. These techniques can be invaluable in situations where inelastic electron tunneling or neutron scattering measurements are difficult or impossible to make. Further, recent model calculations for strong-coupled superconductors have demonstrated that T_{c}'s can be quantitatively estimated from a knowledge of various frequency moments (\omega^{n}) of the phonon spectrum.[26]^{-}[28]

The (\omega^{n}) are defined in terms of the phonon density of states F(\omega) by

\[\langle\,\omega^{n}\,\rangle=\int\omega^{n}F(\omega)\,d\omega\ ,\] (16)

which is an expression that is difficult to compare with experiment. However, it can be shown that the (\omega^{n}) can be directly obtained from lattice heat-capacity data without resort to detailed measurements of phonon dispersion curves.[29] Some of the superconducting properties can then be calculated with the aid of the Allen-Dynes formula:[28]

\[T_{c}=\frac{f_{1}f_{2}}{1.20}\omega_{\rm log}\exp\,\left[\frac{1.04(1+\lambda) }{\mu^{\bullet}+0.62\lambda\mu^{\bullet}-\lambda}\,\right]\ .\] (17)

Here, the parameter \omega_{\rm log} is a characteristic phonon scaling frequency given by

\[\omega_{\rm log}=\exp\,\left[\frac{2}{\lambda}\int\alpha^{2}F(\omega)\ln\omega \,d\,\ln\omega\,\right]\ ,\] (18)

and the electron-phonon coupling \lambda is calculated from

\[\lambda=2\int\alpha^{2}F(\omega)\,d\,\ln\omega\ .\] (19)

\omega_{\rm log} cannot be directly calculated from heat-capacity data without making additional assumptions concerning the frequency dependence of the electron-phonon spectral function \alpha^{2}F(\omega). Fortunately, previous experiments and analyses[28] have shown that \omega_{\rm log}\approx\overline{\omega}_{\rm log}, where

\[\overline{\omega}_{\rm log}\equiv\exp\,\left[\frac{\int F(\omega)\ln\omega\,d \,\ln\omega}{\int F(\omega)\,d\,\ln\omega}\,\right]\ .\] (20)

**A** schematic form for F(\omega) can be obtained by fitting the frequency moments obtained from heat-capacity data to the following expression:

\[\langle\,\omega^{n}\,\rangle=\frac{\int F(\omega)\,\omega^{n}\,d\omega}{\int F (\omega)\,d\,\omega}\ .\] (21)

**Note** that a customary normalization sets \int F(\omega)\,d\omega=1. Using the facts that the functions f_{1} and f_{2} are near unity for \lambda\lesssim 1.5, and the Coulomb pseudopotential \mu^{\bullet}\approx 0.1 for transition metals, one obtains a reasonably quantitative relation between T_{c}, \lambda, and the heat-capacity data:

\[T_{c}\,\frac{\overline{\omega}_{\rm log}}{1.2}\exp\,\left[\frac{1.04(1+\lambda )}{\mu^{\bullet}+0.62\lambda\mu^{\bullet}-\lambda}\,\right]\ .\] (22)

Although there are no particular assumptions which must be made concerning the detailed behavior of F(\omega), in practice it is sufficient to assume a four- to six-parameter model spectrum of the form

\[F(\omega)=\sum_{i}D_{i}F_{D}(\omega/\theta_{i})\ ,\] (23)

where F_{D} is an elementary Debye spectrum characterized by a "partial Debye temperature" \theta_{i} (Ref. [27]):

\[F_{D}(\omega/\theta_{i})=\begin{cases}3\omega^{2}\theta_{i}^{-3},&\omega\leq \theta_{i}\\ 0,&\omega>\theta_{i}\ .\end{cases}\] (24)

The fitting procedure is constrained by the normalization condition \sum D_{i}=1 (equivalent to the fact that the high-temperature lattice heat capacity \to 3R ), and the entropy constraint on the electronic heat capacity at T_{c}. This procedure has been found to yield values of \langle\,\omega^{n}\,\rangle and \overline{\omega}_{\rm log} that compare favorably with the results of tunneling and neutron scattering experiments for A15 compounds.[30, 31] The procedure is initially aided by the fact that [C(T)-\gamma^{\bullet}T]T^{-3} is an approximate image of the spectral weight D(\omega)-\omega^{-2}F(\omega) for \overline{\pi}\omega=5k_{B}T (Refs. [27, 29, and 30]). The rms deviations of the data from the best-fit model heat capacities derived from Eq. (23) are \sim 1\%.

The phonon moment method we have used is subject to a number of important assumptions. All of the contributions to C_{P_{B}}(T) except the electronic term \gamma^{\bullet}T are assumed to be phononic in origin; otherwise, our procedure may be viewed as a convenient way to analyze the normal-state data over a wide temperature range [where Eq. (3) fails] using only a small number of adjustable parameters. The assumption of a composite Debye spectrum for F(\omega) ignores anharmonicity. However, considerably more detail and additional assumptions must be incorporated into this type of analysis in order to approximate anharmonic effects,[26, 32] and we have neglected them in the fitting procedure.

## IV Experimental results and analysis

The experimental data for C_{P}T^{-1} are plotted versus T^{2} for each of the U_{\phi}X compounds in Figs. 1 and 2. There is marked nonlinear character in these plots at T\geq 5 K, as shown in Fig. 3. This behavior implies that a high density of low-energy excitations (e.g., "soft" phonons or paramagnons) dominates the heat capacity of these materials. The strong negative curvature at modest temperatures in C_{P}T^{-1} versus T^{2} is very similar to the data for high-T_{c}, high-H_{c2}, A 15, and Chevrel phase materials.[26, 30, 33] However, the overall magnitudes of the heat capacities of the U_{\phi}X compounds are several times larger than many high-T_{c} materials, and are more than an order of magnitude larger than those of simple metals such as Cu.[5, 22, 23]

### Polynomial analysis

Extreme care must be exercised in the use of the polynomial ("POLY") method to extract physical parameters relevant to the U_{\phi}X materials. Specifically, the POLY analysis must be restricted to a narrow temperature interval above T_{c} where the curvature of C_{P_{h}}T^{-1} versus T^{2} is relatively insignificant. The best-fit parameters from the POLY analysis of the normal- and superconducting-state data are summarized in Table 2.

Comparisons of the experimental data and the best-fit predictions of Eqs. (3) and (6) are given in Fig. 3. We note that the transition anomaly at T_{c} is relatively broad in the case of U_{6}Mn. This is probably due to the poorer quality of U used in preparing this sample and the relatively high vapor pressure of Mn in the melt. Peculiarities in the metallurgy and lattice parameters of U_{6}Mn have been noted earlier.[8, 20] Unfortunately, a significant transition width introduces uncertainties in the estimation of the jump \Delta C_{P}(T_{c}) in heat capacity at T_{c} and the intrinsic behavior of H_{c}(T), not to mention T_{c} itself.

We have defined a calorimetric width 8T_{c} of the transition by noting the temperatures of the peak in C_{P_{h}} and the intersection of the extrapolations of C_{P_{h}} (given by the parameters of Table 2) and the quasilinear-T region of the transition anomaly. A minimum value \Delta C_{P}^{min} of \Delta C_{P}(T_{c}) can be estimated from the difference in C_{P_{h}} at the peak of the anomaly and C_{P_{h}} near the onset of the transition anomaly. This number can be compared to an "ideal" value, \Delta C_{P}^{ideal} determined by extrapolating C_{P_{h}}(T<T_{c}) and C_{P_{h}}(T>T_{c}) into the transition region. An estimate T_{c}(can) for T_{c} is obtained from a graphical analysis of a C_{P}T^{-1} versus T plot. T_{c}(can) is adjusted until the entropy difference \Delta S(T) [see Eq. (14)] estimated from the actual data near T_{c}(can) and an idealized, sharp transition anomaly at T_{c}(can), are equal.

Additional estimates of T_{c} can be extracted from fits of H_{c}(T) to the "parabolic law" of Eq. (15) (yielding "T_{c}^{phn}), and by extrapolating the calculated values of H_{c}(T) and

Figure 3: Heat capacity C_{P} divided by temperature T vs T^{2} for U_{\phi}X (X = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) compounds. Experimental data are represented by the points, and fits of the data by the polynomial method are represented by the lines. Details of the fit parameters are given in Table 2. The polynomial method provides an excellent fit for the normal-state U_{\phi}Fe data for T\leq 10 K, whereas the method is successful only for T\leq 5.5 K in the case of the other compounds.

 \Delta S(T) [from Eqs. (12) and (14)] to H_{c} or \Delta S=0 at "T_{c}^{th}." Additional parameters, chiefly relevant to the superconducting state, are collected in Table 3. The data for \Delta C_{P}(T_{c})/\gamma^{\star}T_{c} show evidence for strong coupling (compared to a BCS value of 1.43), particularly in the case of U_{6}Fe.

Measurements of the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(T) can also provide additional information concerning the coupling strength and the quality of the fits. Plots of H_{c}(T) versus T, as calculated from Eq. (12), are shown in Fig. 4. Various parameters concerning H_{c}(T) are summarized in Table 4. The tabulated values of the ratio H_{c}^{2}(0)/\gamma^{\star}T_{c}^{2} are to be compared to the BCS ratio, 5.94. These ratios corroborate the evidence for strong-coupling renormalizations of \Delta C_{P}(T_{c})/\gamma^{\star}T_{c} values listed in Table 3: U_{6}Mn appears to be BCS-like, while U_{6}Co is moderately strong coupled and U_{6}Fe is substantially strong coupled. The close agreement between various estimates of T_{c} and H_{c}(0) for each compound indicates that the fitting procedure is satisfactory. However, we note that the relatively poor quality of the U_{6}Mn sample is clearly reflected in the strong positive curvature of H_{c}(T) near a poorly-defined T_{c}.

Another check of the fitting procedure can be made by comparing the low-temperature behavior of the superconducting-state data C_{P_{x}} to the extrapolation formula of Eq. (6). We define the electronic contribution to the superconducting-state heat capacity by

\[C_{es}=C_{P_{x}}-\beta T^{3}-\alpha T^{5}\ .\] (25)

Plots of \ln[C_{es}/\gamma^{\star}T_{c}] versus T_{c}/T for U_{6}Mn, U_{6}Fe, and U_{6}Co are shown in Fig. 5. These data can be compared to BCS model predictions where

\[\frac{C_{es}}{\gamma^{\star}T_{c}}\approx 8.5\exp(-1.44T_{c}/T)\] (26)

for 2.5\la T_{c}/T\la 6 (Ref. 25). Comparisons of the data of

The points were derived from experimental data using Eq. (25), as described in the text. The solid lines represent fits of the points to Eq. (26) over the temperature range 0.9–1.5 K.

  Fig. 5 to fits using Eq. (26) are also shown in Fig. 5.

The precise form of the temperature dependence of the superconducting energy gap D(_T_) may cause deviations from Eq. (26) near T_{c}, and gap anisotropy or strong-coupling effects may cause additional deviations at very low temperatures.[25, 34, 35] The data for U6Mn and U6Co are well fitted by Eq. (26) to rather high temperatures [outside the expected range of validity of Eq. (26)], and U6Fe exhibits a BCS-like behavior over the expected temperature range. The quality and self-consistency of the fits using Eq. (6) are strongly supported by the results shown in Fig. 5. Lower-temperature measurements of C_{p_{\rm{s}}} for U6X compounds would be desirable in view of recent claims[36, 37] that the non-BCS behavior of C_{es} in UBe_{13} provides clear evidence for triplet pairing.

### Phonon moment analysis

Results of the fits of the heat-capacity data of U6X compounds over a wide temperature range using the phonon moment ("MOM") analysis are summarized in Table 5. Plots of C_{p}T^{-1} versus T are shown in Fig. 6, along with the behavior calculated for selected "best" fits. The parameters relevant to the model curves shown in Fig. 6 are collected in Table 6. The agreement between the values of \gamma^{\star} and \Theta_{D} from the POLY analysis (see Table 2) and the average values of \gamma^{\star} and \Theta(\textit{T}\to 0) from the MOM analysis (see Table 5) is excellent.

Our analyses indicate that the small, systematic differences between the corresponding parameters given in Tables 2 and 5 are primarily due to differing estimates of S_{\rm{min}} [see Eq. (8)] obtained in the two methods used to fit the data. S_{\rm{min}} is estimated in the MOM method by fitting the first 5-10 superconducting-state data at \textit{T}\!>\!T_{\rm{min}} to a form C_{s}\!=\!\xi T^{3}\!+\!\eta T^{5}, yielding S_{\rm{min}}\!=\!\frac{1}{3}\xi T_{\rm{min}}^{3}\!+\!\eta T_{\rm{min}}^{5}. This procedure will generally overestimate S_{\rm{min}}, leading to systematically higher \gamma^{\star} values compared to the POLY method. Note also that the POLY method gives a much stronger weight to lower-temperature data due to the reduced size of the fitting interval and strict enforcement of the entropy constraint at T_{c}. The MOM method treats all of the data with equal weight. Additional calculations of T_{c} and H_{c}(\textit{T}) within the MOM analysis are in excellent agreement with the POLY results quoted earlier and will not be detailed here.

The _qualitative_ nature (e.g., the relative weight of low-frequency modes) of the D(\omega)\!\sim\!\omega^{-2}F(\omega) required to fit the heat-capacity data for the U6X samples can be inferred from our analyses; whereas it is important to note that several _quantitatively_ different model F(\omega)'s have been shown previously to provide equally satisfactory fits of the data for A 15 materials.[30] Plots of \omega^{-2}F(\omega) are shown in Fig. 7, corresponding to the "best" fit models given in Fig. 6 and Table 6. Note that the higher-T_{c} U6Fe compound has significantly more weight in the low-frequency end of F(\omega) than the lower-T_{c} U6Ni material. It is interesting that experimental data for \gamma^{\star} and \Theta (\textit{T}\!\to\!0) roughly correlate and anticorrelate, respectively, with T_{c} in a number of transition metal materials.[30, 38, 39, 27] Such a trend presumably results from the increased renormalization of long-wavelength acoustic phonons that accompanies an increased electronic density of

  states.[26] Nevertheless, it is still surprising that such an effect could result in the fourfold to fivefold increase in the \beta coefficient of the T^{3} term of the lattice heat capacity noted in comparing the close analogues U_{6}Mn and U_{6}Fe, or U_{6}Ni and U_{6}Co.

  model fits of the electronic heat capacity. Further experiments, such as inelastic neutron scattering, would be useful to justify such an analysis.

Although the MOM fits to the U_{6}Mn and U_{6}Ni data are excellent over a wide range of temperature, there are significant discrepancies between the fits and the data at T \sim 25 K. This is particularly noticeable for U_{6}Ni (see Fig. 6), suggesting that it may be necessary to add Einstein modes to F(\omega) in order to reproduce the extreme negative curvature observed in C_{P}T^{-1} versus T^{2} at higher temperatures. However, the upper cutoffs (\theta_{3} in Table 6) are not uniquely defined when they are the same order as \sim 8T_{\rm max}, where T_{\rm max} is the maximum temperature achieved in the measurements. Higher-temperature data, especially for U_{6}Co and U_{6}Fe, are required to fully reveal the differences in behavior of the U_{6}_X_ compounds.

The C_{P}T^{-1} versus T plots of Fig. 3 emphasize the remarkable differences in low-temperature curvature of C_{P} between the closely analogous pairs of compounds, U_{6}Fe and U_{6}Mn, and U_{6}Co and U_{6}Ni. Such differences among analogous compounds have also been observed in Chevrel phases[33, 39] Mo_{6}Se_{6} (T_{c} = 6.3 K) and Mo_{6}S_{8} (T_{c} = 1.8 K). Although the magnitude of C_{P}(T) for the U_{6}_X_ materials is 1 order of magnitude greater than that of the Chevrel phases, the absolute differences in C_{P}T^{-1} between higher- and lower-T_{c} analogues are quite comparable for the two types of materials.

The large \gamma^{*} coefficients typically observed in heavy-fermion materials automatically lead to very high entropies at modest temperatures, as demanded by Eq. (1). It is reasonable to associate these large entropies with the presence of "quasilocalized" excitations arising from the hybridization of localized f states with itinerant conduction states.[40, 41] It has been pointed out[41] that so far the electronic entropy S_{e} has only been extracted from calorimetric data for two heavy-fermion compounds (UBe_{13} and U_{2}Zn_{17}) due to the limited availability of suitable analogue materials that are useful in approximating the lattice contribution C_{l}. However, it is still very difficult to clearly separate electronic and lattice contributions to the heat capacity, even when suitable analogue compounds (which display a Debye behavior over a significant temperature interval) are available.[42] Recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements[43, 44] on UBe_{13} and UPt_{3} have provided more direct means for deducing C_{l}, and surprisingly, these data show no evidence for a "strong coupling" (e.g., phonon softening at low T) between the electron and lattice systems in these two materials.

The four U_{6}_X_ compounds constitute a unique system of analogues exhibiting reasonably large effective masses and an \sim 50% variation in \gamma^{*}. It is, therefore, of particular interest to compare the variations of the low-temperature S_{e} of these compounds. A plot of the total entropies S(T) for U_{6}Mn and U_{6}Fe are shown in Fig. 8. Note that by T \approx 15 K an entropy difference of \sim 2 J/mol K \sim 0.35R ln2 has been established between these compounds. A similar plot, including U_{6}Mn, U_{6}Co, and U_{6}Ni, is shown in Fig. 9. An entropy difference of \sim 0.45R ln2 is established between U_{6}Co and U_{6}Ni by T \approx 13 K. Note also that these entropy differences appear to saturate with increasing temperature by \sim 15 K, although this conclusion is based on a somewhat limited data set. These entropy differences are remarkable, even if they are normalized to the U concentration. Unfortunately, there is no Th-based, non-5f (and therefore low-\gamma^{*}) analogue available for such comparisons. Higher-temperature heat capacity and low-temperature inelastic neutron scattering data would be desirable in order to better quantify these results and confirm the saturation of the entropy differences between various U_{6}_X_ compounds.

The low-temperature behavior of C_{P}(T) for the U_{6}_X_ compounds can be discussed from yet another interesting point of view. DeLong _et al.[12]_ reported that the

The curves were calculated using the POLY method, as described in the text.

  normal-state heat capacity of U_{6}Fe exhibited an unusual T^{2} behavior over the temperature range 4\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,T\, \raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,20 K, as shown in Fig. 10. The solid line in Fig. 10 corresponds to a temperature dependence T^{\ast} with n=2.06.

A T^{2} dependence of the _lattice_ heat capacity C_{l} has previously been observed in high-T_{c}A\,15 compounds such as Nb_{3}Sn and Nb_{3}Al by Webb _et al._, [45] and was correlated with a strong T^{2} dependence of the electrical resistivity over a similar temperature interval. Webb _et al._ proposed a model phonon density of states F(\omega) that simultaneously reproduced the behavior of both C_{l}(T) and the T^{2} term of the resistivity, suggesting that it arose from electron-phonon scattering in the presence of a high density of low-energy phonon modes. T^{2} terms in the low-temperature (T< 5 K) resistivities of U_{6}Fe and U_{6}Co have been recently observed. [46]

We have intensified our interest in the T^{2} behavior of U_{6}Fe in view of recent observations [47] of a very low-temperature T^{2} dependence of C_{P}(T) for the heavy-fermion material, CeAl_{3}. We anticipated that U_{6}Co might also display a T^{2} character to C_{P}(T) due to this compound's high \gamma^{\ast} and strong low-frequency weight in F(\omega) (see Fig. 7). Indeed, we have found T^{2} behavior, but within two separate temperature intervals, 8 K \,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,T\, \raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,13 K and 2 K \,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,T\, \raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,5 K; We also note that C_{P}(T) roughly varies as T^{\ast} with n\approx2.14 in the interval 5 K \,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,T\, \raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,13 K, demonstrating that the approximate variation of C_{P}(T) is close to T^{2} over the entire normal-state range investigated, 2.3 K \,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,T\, \raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,13 K.

Plots of C_{P} versus T^{2} are given in Fig. 11 for U_{6}Fe, U_{6}Co, and U_{6}Mn. C_{P} of U_{6}Mn only roughly follows a T^{2} dependence for 10 K \,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,T\, \raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,20 K. If we demand that the total C_{P}(T) be described by a "simple T^{2\ast} law that intersects the origin, we find that U_{6}Fe obeys such a law at all experimental temperatures T\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$>$}\,T_{c}, U_{6}Co satisfies the law less well for T\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$>$}\,T_{c}, and U_{6}Mn follows such a dependence only for T\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$>$}\,14 K. Alternatively, we observe that the region of T^{2} behavior may shift to higher temperatures as \gamma^{\ast} decreases. We note that Webb _et al._[45] observed nonzero intercepts for extrapolations of the T^{2} regions of C_{l}(T) for A\,15 compounds.

We wish to emphasize that the difficulty in separating the lattice and electronic contributions to C_{P}(T) makes it dangerous to attribute low-energy structure in the experimentally deduced F(\omega) to phonon excitations alone, although this certainly cannot be ruled out. It is possible that a T^{2} behavior of C_{P}(T) may be an artifact of high-\gamma^{\ast} materials for which a clear separation of the lattice contribution is most suspect. For example, we have found that the Mo_{6}Se_{8} and Mo_{6}S_{8} data of Ref. [33] do not exhibit a T^{2} phenomenon. This may be associated with the fact that \gamma^{\ast}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\sim$}}\raisebox{1.72pt}{$<$}\,2.6 \times 10^{3} erg/cm^{3} K^{2} for these two Chevrel phases, [33, 39] 1 order of magnitude smaller than

  the \gamma^{\bullet} of the U_{6}_X_ compounds. On the other hand, we find that the data of Junod _et al_.[48] for the pseudobinary A 15 Ti_{75}Ir_{20}Pt_{5} do follow a _T_^{2} dependence (as shown in Fig. 12); and this material has a \gamma^{\bullet}\!\approx\!9\times\!10^{3} erg/cm^{3} K^{2}, more comparable to the U_{6}_X_ and high-_T__{c}_A_ 15 compounds.

Measurements of C_{P}(T) were also carried out in applied magnetic-field strengths of 2 kOe in the case of U_{6}Fe and U_{6}Co, and the results are shown in Figs. 13 and 14. There is no apparent field-induced change in the data, save the small reductions in T_{c} and \Delta C, for a 2 kOe field. Calorimetric determinations of the initial slope of the upper critical field H^{\prime}_{c2}(T) were made taking care to idealize the transition anomaly in such a manner as to comply with the entropy constraint at T_{c}. The results are H^{\prime}_{c2}(T)\!=\!-3.64 T/K and -3.33 T/K for U_{6}Fe and U_{6}Co, respectively. Resistive measurements [12, 13] on the same U_{6}Fe sample II-33 have yielded H^{\prime}_{c2}(T_{c})\!=\!-3.42 T/K. Menovsky _et al_.[49] have measured the heat capacity of U_{6}Co in applied fields of 0 to 5 T (in 1 T steps), and found H^{\prime}_{c2}(T_{c})\!=\!-3.77/K, T_{c}(H\!=\!0)\!=\!2.3 K and \gamma^{\bullet}(H\!=\!0)\!=\!126 mJ/mol K^{2}, all in very good agreement with our results. DeLong _et al_.[50] have resistively measured two different U_{6}Co samples and found H^{\prime}_{c2}(T_{c})\!=\!-3.3 T/K and -3.9 T/K.

The relatively large transition width observed for the U_{6}Mn sample II-46 was attributed to impurities in the U starting materials, and it was therefore useful to measure the magnetic susceptibility of this sample in order to check for temperature-dependent paramagnetism or ferromagnetic impurity phases. Data for the magnetization \sigma were taken at several temperatures. The susceptibility \chi^{\bullet}, defined by the slope of \sigma versus H, was found to be temperature independent for 6 K \leq T\!\leq\!240 K, but a small remanence developed at T\!\leq\!120 K. This is confirmed in the plot of \sigma/H versus T in a fixed field H\!=\!2.0 T, as shown in Fig. 15. The value of \sigma/H\!=\!3.1\times\!10^{-3} cm^{3}/mol at T\!=\!6 K is in excellent agreement with the results of DeLong _et al_.[5] Sample II-46 exhibits about 1 order of magnitude less remanence than their data for U_{6}Fe sample II-33, suggesting that there were not abnormally large amounts of ferromagnetic phases present in our U_{6}Mn sample.

## V Discussion of results

We now turn to a discussion of possible interpretations of our heat-capacity data. The unusually high values of \gamma^{\bullet} and the evidence for a high density of low-energy excitations in the U_{6}_X_ compounds imply that simple models and traditional interpretations for these data should be regarded with caution. In view of the probable strong 5f contributions to the electronic density of states of these materials, several phenomenological models that recently have been applied to heavy-fermion systems are discussed below.

### Fermi-liquid approach

Several arguments [40, 51, 52] have been given that imply the superconductivity in heavy-fermion metals should be of an odd-parity type mediated by the exchange of paramagnons. Given that liquid ^{3}He is an exchange-enhanced, triplet-paired superfluid that can also be described as "nearly localized", [53]^{-}[55] Fermi-liquid theory has frequently been used to compare heavy-fermion superconductors to ^{3}He. Many of these approaches should be carefully distinguished from the microscopic "paramagnon model" [56, 57] for exchange-enhanced metals and ^{3}He. Our heat-capacity results have already been used [5] to analyze magnetic susceptibility data for the U_{6}X compounds in terms of the paramagnon model, and this approach will not be discussed further. We will instead compare our results to recent applications of Landau Fermi-liquid theory to the heavy-fermion problem. The reader is referred to Refs. [41] and [58] for reviews of these techniques.

We are specifically interested in comparing our heat-capacity data with model predictions of the superconducting transition temperature and pairing symmetry. We use the weak-coupling calculation of T_{c} by Patton and Zaringhalam [59] as outlined by Pethick and Pines. [58] The normal-state properties are described by the symmetric (s) and antisymmetric (a) Landau parameters

\[A_{l}^{s,a} = \frac{F_{l}^{s,a}}{1 + F_{l}^{s,a}/(2l + 1)}\ \ .\] (27)

We assume the forward-scattering sum rule is satisfied in the "sp approximation:" [60]

\[\sum_{l = 0}^{1}\left( \, A_{l}^{s} + A_{l}^{a} \right) = 0\ \ .\] (28)

The transition temperature is given in terms of a weak-coupling formula for pairing in a state of orbital angular momentum L = [l(l + 1)]^{1/2}\#:

\[^{\mu}T_{c} = 1.13\Theta_{c}\,\exp\left( \, 1/\lambda_{\mu} \right)\ ,\] (29)

where the pairing interaction strengths in the singlet (\mu \equiv 0) and triplet (\mu \equiv 1) channels are given by

\[\begin{array}{l} \lambda_{0} = \sum_{l}\,\frac{( - 1)^{l}}{4}\left( \, A_{l}^{s} - 3\, A_{l}^{a} \right)\ ,\\ \lambda_{1} = \sum_{l}\,\frac{( - 1)^{l}}{12}\left( \, A_{l}^{s} + A_{l}^{a} \right)\ .\end{array}\] (30)

\Theta_{c} is a cutoff that must satisfy ^{\mu}T_{c} \ll \Theta_{c} << T_{F}^{\bullet} in the weak-coupling limit. [41] Note that in the sp approximation the sums in Eq. (30) are taken only over l = 0,1, and \lambda_{\mu} must be less than zero for an attractive interaction and nonzero T_{c} to occur.

We will discuss our attempts to apply Eqs. (27)-(30) to our data using four different types of approximations. The first method was used by Valls and Tesanovic [61] in a direct application of the "almost localized" model of ^{3}He to heavy-fermion superconductors. The assumption of a large m^{\bullet}/m_{e} and incipient localization imply A_{l}^{s} \sim 3, A_{l}^{s} \sim 1, and A_{l}^{a} \sim - 3, and the sum rule [Eq. (30)] is used to obtain A_{l}^{a} = - 1. Equations (30) then yield \lambda_{0} = 1 and \lambda_{1} = - \frac{1}{3}, and thereby predict triplet superconductivity. It is customary [58] to reexpress \Theta_{c} in terms of either the Fermi or spin-fluctuation temperatures:

\[1.13\Theta_{c} = 8T_{F}^{\bullet} = \beta T_{\rm sf}\ .\] (31)

\delta and \beta are unknown scaling factors, and it is assumed that T_{sf} = (1 + F_{0}^{a})T_{F}^{\bullet}. [58] A summary of experimental parameters for the four U_{6}X compounds is given in Table 7, and a list of parameters derived from the "almost localized" model is given in Table 8.

The method used by Valls and Tesanovic suffers from several serious defects. It assumes Galilean invariance within the Fermi liquid and sets m^{\bullet}/m_{e} = 1 + F_{1}^{s}/3, implying A_{l}^{s} \sim 3 for heavy fermions. However, the Bloch symmetry of crystals invalidates the relation between m^{\bullet}/m_{e} and F_{1}^{s}. [41, 58] Further, the m^{\bullet} values of the U_{6}X compounds are roughly 1 order of magnitude less than those of UPt_{3} and UBe_{13}, and the assumption of A_{l}^{s} \sim 3 is probably not justified in our case.

A second method, which we label the "induced interaction" approach, [58, 62, 63] relies on a general treatment of the Landau interaction function in the case of a short-range potential between quasiparticles. [64, 65] We assume A_{0}^{s} \sim 1 for a charged Fermi liquid, [58] and the effective mass is given by

\[m^{\bullet}/m_{b} = 1 + F_{1}^{s}/3\ ,\] (32)

where m_{b} is the quasiparticle mass in the absence of "backflow," [62, 63] and contains renormalizations due to band structure and the electron-phonon interaction. The quasiparticle mass m_{b} can be measured in the superconducting state via observation of the London penetration depth. [63] The essential point is that this approach does not rely on Galilean invariance of the Fermi liquid. Unfortunately, the practical application of the model is best achieved by fixing F_{0}^{a} and A_{0}^{a} with the T^{3}\ln T contribution to C_{P}, such as is possible in the case of ^{3}He, UPt_{3}, and UAl_{2}. [58] Since very few materials unambiguously exhibit the T^{3}\ln T term (the U_{6}X compounds evidently do not), one must adopt another means of fixing F_{0}^{a}.

We have chosen to relate F_{0}^{a} to the "R ratio" for a spin-\frac{1}{2} Fermi liquid:

\[R = \frac{1}{3}\,\left[ \frac{\pi k_{B}}{\mu_{B}} \right]^{2}\frac{X^{\bullet}(T \to 0)}{\gamma^{\bullet}}\sim(1 + F_{0}^{a})^{-1}\ .\] (33)

The validity of this relation has been discussed [5] in ap

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c}  & T_{c} & & k_{F}a & & T_{F}^{\bullet}a \\ Compound & (K) & R & (108 cm−1) & m^{\bullet}/m_{e}a & (K) \\ \hline U_{6}Mn & 2.21 & 2.2 & 1.56 & 15 & 7200 \\ U_{6}Fe & 3.70 & 1.4 & 1.57 & 23 & 4690 \\ U_{6}Co & 2.29 & 1.5 & 1.57 & 20 & 5540 \\ U_{6}Ni & 0.35 & 2.4 & 1.565 & 13.5 & 8020 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}

 plication to heavy-fermion systems. The major risks in using Eq. (33) stem from its omission of band-structure and spin-orbit effects on the magnetic susceptibility \chi^{\star}. However, these approximations are certainly consistent with those used in the majority of Fermi-liquid models.[41]

The "induced interaction" approach yields, in the case of U_{6}Fe, \lambda_{1}\!=\!0.1, thereby precluding a triplet pairing state, and \lambda_{0}\!=\!0.1\!-\!A^{\,\dagger}_{1}. A^{\,\dagger}_{1} cannot be determined from Eq. (32) without knowledge of m_{b}. Assuming 1\!\leq\!m_{b}/m_{e}\!\lesssim\!14, we deduce 1.2\!\lesssim\!A^{\,\dagger}_{1}\!\lesssim\!2.9 and -2.8\!\lesssim\!\lambda_{0}\!\lesssim\!-1.1. However, these parameters imply 4.7\!\lesssim\!\Theta_{c}\!\lesssim\!  pounds (triplet T_{c}'s are extremely low, whenever \lambda_{1}\!<\!0), although these materials appear to be near a crossover to the triplet state. Note also that the values of \Theta_{c} for the U_{d}_X_ compounds justify the weak-coupling formula, and that \Theta_{c}\!<\!\!<\!T_{sf}, suggesting that paramagnon pairing is "cut off"[51] by a lower-energy excitation such as phonons.

Several caveats to the above Fermi-liquid analyses should be mentioned. Band-structure effects arising from a breakdown of Galilean invariance lead to a "bare band mass" and orbital contributions to \chi^{\star} that either have been neglected or only roughly approximated in our analyses. Spin-orbit and anisotropy effects are also omitted, and the weak coupling Eq. (29) should not be trusted for calculation of accurate values of relevant parameters.[41] The parameters k_{F}, m^{\star}, and T_{F}^{\star} are also uncertain since they depend upon a proper choice of the fermion density n, which is not easily determined from independent measurements. Pethick and Pines[57] and DeLong[67] have given phenomenological arguments for assuming that each U atom contributes three "heavy fermions" (other contributions to n are neglected). We have adopted this assumption given the lack of direct experimental measurements of n and our desire to express our results within a common convention used by other authors.

In spite of the many approximations that one is forced to make in the application of Fermi-liquid theory, the various models discussed above generally yield quite reasonable values for the Landau parameters and associated quantities. At present there is no accepted microscopic model for heavy-fermion metals, and it is therefore useful to compare the Fermi-liquid properties of the U_{b}_X_ compounds to those of related materials. We believe that the relative trends and semiquantitative results given in Table 9 have physical significance.

### Strong-coupling analysis

The results of the Fermi-liquid analyses suggest that even-parity superconductivity due to the usual electron-phonon interaction is probably appropriate to the U_{b}_X_ compounds. The large size of the specific-heat jump at T_{c} and the zero-temperature thermodynamic critical field for U_{b}Co and U_{b}Fe (see Tables 3 and 4) imply that our results should be analyzed with a theoretical model that takes into account strong-coupling effects. We have accordingly compared our data to the Allen-Dynes model[28] in order to extract values of the electron-phonon coupling \lambda [see Eq. (19)] and the band-structure density of states N_{b}(E_{F}) given by

\[N_{b}(E_{F})\!=\!\frac{N^{\star}(E_{F})}{1\!+\!\lambda}=\frac{3\gamma^{\star} }{2\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}(1\!+\!\lambda)}\ \ .\] (35)

\lambda must be deduced from the T_{c} formula [Eq. (17)] using the approximation \omega_{\rm log}\!\approx\!\overline{\omega}_{\rm log} [see Eqs. (18) and (20)] and the functions f_{1} and f_{2} defined by

\[f_{1}\!=\![1\!+\!(\lambda/\Lambda_{1})^{3/2}]^{1/3}\] (36)

and

\[f_{2}\!=\!1\!+\!\frac{\lambda^{2}(\overline{\omega}_{2}/\omega_{\rm log}\!- \!1)}{\lambda^{2}\!+\!\Lambda_{2}^{2}}\ \ ,\] (37)

where

\[\Lambda_{1}\!=\!2.46(1\!  proximately double that of the higher-T_{c}_A_15's (Refs. [30] and [68]) and is comparable to that of U_{6}Fe.[12] The evidence for a strong Pauli limiting of H_{c2} for V_{3}Ga (Ref. [68]) suggests that paramagnons may be the appropriate mechanism responsible for the suppression of the superconducting properties of this compound. Indeed, phenomenological arguments[67, 71] imply that magnetic interactions strongly suppress superconductivity for N^{\bullet}(E_{F}) values slightly larger than those observed for the U_{6}_X_ and V_{3}Ga compounds.

However, applying the same line of reasoning to the U_{6}_X_ materials does not yield a straightforward explanation of their anomalous properties. In particular, no clear evidence has yet been found that the H_{c2} of U_{6}Fe is at all Pauli limited; indeed, the temperature dependences of H_{c2} for U_{6}Fe and U_{6}Co exhibit unusual positive curvature and low-temperature values that are significantly _greater_ than expected.[46, 50] Further, one must also simultaneously explain why lower T_{c}'s and _larger_ values of the susceptibility enhancement ratio R are correlated with _smaller_N^{\bullet}(E_{F}) in these materials[71] (see Tables VII and X). Note that considerable difficulties have been encountered in explaining similar effects in A15 materials.[68]

We have neglected exotic or complex contributions to the heat capacity in our analyses. It is possible that anharmonic corrections (e.g., "phonon softening") can account for the unusual behavior of the U_{6}_X_ materials, as has been suggested for A15 materials.[26, 72] Subtle low-temperature phase transitions[6, 73, 74] and polaronic[75, 76, 77, 78] effects are also possible mechanisms for anomalous behavior in these materials.

A complete analysis of the heat capacity of the U_{6}_X_ compounds, including a well-defined separation of the electronic and lattice contributions, may prove particularly difficult in view of the breakdown of adiabaticity inferred from the heat-capacity behavior of a number of narrow-band materials.[5, 67, 70, 71, 79] The properties of the U_{6}_X_ compounds and their incomplete parallels with A15 and Chevrel compounds remain enigmatic and deserve further study.
