# Abstract

A series of new Sr2-,BaCuO3+,d (0 <= x <= 0.6) superconductors were prepared using high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis. A Rietveld refinement based on powder x-ray diffraction confirms that the superconductors crystallize in the K2-NiF4-type structure of a space group I4/_mm_ similar to that of LaCuO4 but with partially occupied apical oxygen sites. It is found that the superconducting transition temperature _T_c of this Ba substituted Sr2CuO3+,d superconductor with constant carrier-doping level, i.e., constant d is controlled not only by order/disorder of apical-O atoms but also by Ba content. _T_max = 98 K is achieved in the material with x = 0.6 that reaches the record value of _T_c among the single-layer copper oxide superconductors and is higher than _T_c = 95 K of Sr2CuO3+,d with optimally ordered apical-O atoms. There is Sr-site disorder in Sr2-,BaCuO3+,d which might lead to a reduction in _T_c. The result indicates that another effect surpasses the disorder effect that is related either to the increased in-plane Cu-O bond length or to elongated apical-O distance due to Ba substitution with larger cation size. The present experiment demonstrates that the optimization of local geometry out of the Cu-O plane can dramatically enhance _T_c in the cuprate superconductors.

## I Introduction

The enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature (_T_c) is one of key concerns for the studies of high-temperature superconductors (HTS). Crystallographically HTS consists of CuO2 plane that supports superconducting current as well as charge reservoir layer where doping takes place. In the hole-doped high-_T_c cuprates the charge reservoir is composed of two parts. That immediately outside the CuO2 plane is called as the apical oxygen (apical-O) layer since the oxygen atoms here are at the apical sites of a CuO6 octahedron or a CuO5 pyramid, and that outside the apical-O layer, is named the second nearest charge-reservoir layer. The cation in the apical-O layer is termed as the A-site cation. The apical-O and A-site cation are expected to be more heavily involved in the electronic state of the CuO2 plane than the second nearest charge reservoir layer via interaction with CuO2 plane since they have direct chemical bonding.

There seem to be several factors to "optimize" the electronic structures of CuO2 plane in order to achieve a higher _T_c. First of all, to induce HTS, one has to dope the parent Mott compounds, i.e., generate carriers into CuO2 plane. Consequently, dopant concentration or carrier density _n_h is the major factor controlling _T_c. It has been found that _T_c generally follows a parabolic relation as function of _n_h showing a maximum at an optimum doping _n_ ricating the tetragonal single-phase Sr2CuO3+\delta that was free of Cl containing phase or other contamination claimed in previous reports.[15] Our studies show that the maximum T_{c} can be achieved for Sr2CuO3+\delta with a nominal doping level at \delta=0.4 (actual \delta should be considerably smaller). We found that the remarkable enhancement of T_{c} at an almost constant doping level in this superconductor is associated with the ordering of the apical oxygen (dopant).[16]

Since superconductivity takes place in the CuO_{2} plane, the in-plane Cu-O bond length which is a measure of hybridization between Cu3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} and O2p_{x,y} orbitals as well as of superexchange coupling between neighboring Cu spins will be correlated with the superconducting order parameters. The in-plane electronic parameters are also controlled by the charger reservoir layer, in particular, by the apical-O distance from the CuO_{2} plane. Therefore, it is expected that T_{c} will also be pertinent to the average size of A site ion. In fact, it has been found that the mean A-site cation size indeed correlates to superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}). For instance, in La2-\delta(Sr, Ba)_{x}CuO_{4} system with the optimum doping level, the variation in T_{c} with A-site cation size has been investigated.[3] A systematic enhanced T_{c} with increasing A-site ion size were observed.[17, 18, 19]

In fact, the out-of-plane effects induce the geometrical distortions of the unit cell. Nunner _et al.[20]_ have proposed that the geometrical distortions of the unit cell may locally alter the electron-pairing interactions on microscale level. These interactions are much related with the T_{c} of the superconductors. In recent experiment, Slezak _et al.[21]_ had directly observed how variations in interatomic distances, presumably the apical-O distance within individual crystalline unit cells affect the maximum superconducting energy gap of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta}(Bi-2212).

In the present study, we report the effect of average A-site cation size or the change in the lattice constants on T_{c} for the A_{2}CuO_{3+\delta} (A = Sr, Ba) superconductors. Since both Sr and Ba are isovalent alkaline earth element, their substitution does not change the doped carrier density when the excess oxygen content \delta is kept constant. We have successfully synthesized a series of Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} (x\leq 0.6) superconductors under high pressures and high temperatures. We found that T_{c} can be significantly enhanced to 98 K in Ba-substituted Sr_{2}CuO_{3+\delta}

## II II. Experimental

The samples were synthesized in two steps. In the first step, a series of Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3} (0 \leq x\leq 0.6) precursors were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction method from high-purity raw materials SrCO_{3}, BaCO_{3}, and CuO. The powder mixture in an appropriate ratio was ground together in an agate mortar and then calcined at 950 ^{\circ}C for approximately three days in air with two intermediate grindings in order to obtain single-phase samples. In the second step, the precursors were mixed with SrO_{2} and CuO to form the nominal composition of Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} in a dry glove box that was used to prevent the degradation of hygroscopic reagents. The materials were then subjected to high-pressure synthesis under 6 GPa pressure and at 1000 ^{\circ}C for 30 min using a cubic-anvil-type high pressure facility, and then quenched to room temperature before releasing the pressure. The role of SrO_{2} is to create an oxygen atmosphere during the high-pressure synthesis as previously described in the related Cl series[22, 23, 24] or Sr_{2}CuO_{3+\delta} (Ref. [16]) superconductors. Here the excess oxygen content \delta is controlled by the oxidizer amount SrO_{2} in the nominal starting materials. In order to study the ordering effect of the dopant atoms (apical oxygen distribution), we also annealed several samples in the temperature range between 150 and 300 ^{\circ}C for 12 h under 1 atm N_{2} atmosphere in a tube furnace.

The structure of obtained polycrystalline samples was identified by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) collected with 2 \theta steps of 0.02^{\circ} and 3 s counting time in the range of 5 ^{\circ}\leq 2 \theta\leq 120^{\circ} using Cu K\alpha radiation. The x-ray diffraction pattern was refined with Rietveld method using winplotr program. The DC magnetic susceptibility was measured using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer in an external magnetic field of 20 Oe for both zero-field-cooling and field-cooling (FC) modes.

## III III. Results and Discussion

By changing the Sr to Ba ratio and keeping a constant hole concentration (fixed \delta), a series of Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} (0 \leq x\leq 0.6) superconductors were prepared using the high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis. Since a maximum T_{c} is attained in SrCuO_{3+\delta} at nominal \delta=0.4, we keep all the Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} samples with the same oxygen content in order to separate out the A-site effects. The x-ray diffraction patterns show purely tetragonal K_{2}NiF_{4}-type phase with space group I4/mmm in the entire x range up to 0.6. Note that no information on the apical-O configuration can be extracted directly from the x-ray diffraction. Assuming the La_{2}CuO_{4} prototype tetragonal structure but with partially occupied apical oxygen, we refined the crystal structure of Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} using the Rietveld method. Figure 2 shows the XRD pattern of a sample with the nominal composition Sr_{1.84}Ba_{0.16}CuO_{3+\delta}, together with the results of Rietveld refinement. A reasonable R_{\rm wp} (weighed-profile R factor) factor of 8.76% was obtained as shown in Table 1, indicating that the structural model is a reasonable one. Figure 3 shows the cell parameters of the samples as a function of Ba content x for Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} As compared with Sr_{2}CuO_{3+\delta}[16] both a- and c-axis lattice constants of Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} are expanded

  due to larger Ba ion incorporated to the Sr sites. For example, the lattice parameters increased from a = 3.79 A, c = 12.50 A for Sr2CuO3+- (Ref. [16]) to a = 3.89 A, and c = 12.78 A for Sr1,Ba0,CuO3+- b respectively.

In Fig. 4(a) we present the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility measured for the as-prepared samples Sr2-xBaCuO3+- _δ_ with x = 0.16, 0.32, and 0.6 in the FC mode at an external field of 20 Oe. The superconducting transition temperature _Tc_ increases with increasing Ba content. Starting from _Tc_ = 75 K for Sr2CuO3+- _δ_ a maximum _Tc_ = 98 K is reached at x = 0.6. The Meissner volume fraction of Sr2-xBaCuO3+- _δ_ sample is more than 10% at 5 K, suggesting the nature of bulk superconductivity. The Sr2-xBaCuO3+- _δ_ sample with x > 0.6 are mixed phases, showing no superconducting transition.

In the case of Sr2CuO3+- _δ_, _Tc_ can be enhanced to 95K by post annealing at relatively low temperatures (~250 degC), probably because the apical-O atoms order optimally. However, the Ba substituted samples very easily decomposes upon heating at ambient pressure. It is found that Sr2-xBaCuO3+- _δ_ becomes unstable with increasing Ba content due to the fact that the high-pressure synthesized materials with larger unit cell is usually thermodynamically meta-stable at ambient pressure. In Fig. 4(b) we show the postannealing effect on Sr1,9Ba0,1CuO3.4. _Tc_ increases from the initial 80K (as prepared) to 91K by annealing at 250 degC but its superconducting volume fraction appreciably decreases. With increasing Ba content to x = 0.32, _Tc_ = 88 K of as-prepared sample is enhanced to 92K by annealing at 200 degC, but annealing at higher temperatures results in degradation of superconductivity [Fig. 4(c)]. Though the nominal composition is also Sr1,68Ba0,32CuO3+- _Tc_ of the sample is a little lower than the _Tc_ of the sample in Fig. 4(a).In fact, besides the nominal composition, the _Tc_ of the material varies a little depending on the synthesis temperature. In the case of x = 0.6, as prepared _Tc_ reaches 98K, already exceeding the maximum _Tc_ = 95 K of Sr2CuO3+- _δ_ with optimally ordered apical-O atoms. We annealed the sample of Sr1,4Ba0,6CuO3.4 but its superconductivity is lost immediately upon heating even at 150 degC indicating the heavily metastable nature of the Ba substituted sample. It seems that the highest _Tc_ of the present superconductor is realized in the vicinity of a structural instability.

For Sr2CuO3+- _δ_ the electron diffraction (ED) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements are possible to investigate the evolution of the structural modulation associated with the apical-O ordering with post-annealing temperature.[16] A modulated structure with C2/_m_ symmetry is found for as-prepared sample with _Tc_ = 75 K which evolves into a _Pmmm_ modulation structure with _Tc_ = 95 K after annealing at 250 degC. Supposing that the as-prepared samples have the same C2/_m_ modulated structure as that of. Sr2CuO3+- _δ_ then the result indicates that _Tc_ is

  remarkably enhanced by Ba substitution without changing the ordering pattern of apical-O atoms. Unfortunately, the neutron or ED and TEM investigation are not possible at the moment for the Ba-substituted materials since it is difficult to obtain sufficient amount of samples, and they are unstable against heating due to exposure to high-density electron-beam flux. So, we cannot rule out the possibility that the Ba incorporation tends to stabilize the Pmmm modulation corresponding to the "optimal" apical-O ordering in Sr_{2}CuO_{3+\delta} with T_{c} = 95 K. In either case since T_{c} = 98 K achieved in the as-prepared sample of x = 0.6 exceeds the highest T_{c} of Sr_{2}CuO_{3+\delta} it is certain that the larger A-site cation size leads to higher T_{c} in the present system.

It is also noted that the substituted Ba in the Sr_{2}CuO_{3+\delta} plays dual roles: one is to expand the unit cell size and the other is to create disorder due to cation size mismatch between Sr^{2+} and Ba^{2+}. The previous investigation of La_{2}CuO_{4}-related superconductors suggested that T_{c} depends both on the average cation size and the A-site cation disorder. It was also suggested that, if the degree of disorder does not change, T_{c} tends to increase with increasing A-site cation size \langle r_{\rm A}\rangle, while T_{c} decreases with increasing the A-site disorder at the constant average \langle r_{\rm A}\rangle. In the present Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} system, T_{c} of as-prepared sample increases with A-site cation size, achieving 98 K at x = 0.6. The result suggests that the _larger_ A-site cation size is an important ingredient for the enhancement of T_{c} in Sr_{2}CuO_{3+\delta} while the A-site disorder arising from cation size mismatch between Sr and Ba appears to have relatively small effect on T_{c}. Since Sr and Ba are isovalent alkaline earth element, their substitution does not change the carrier density, nor introduce charge disorder, which is different from ordinary A-site substitution with heterovalence ions such as that in La_{2-x}^{3+}Sr_{x}^{2+}CuO_{4}[17, 18, 19]. From the Shannon table,[25] the ionic radius for Ba^{2+} (Sr^{2+}) is 1.47 A (1.31 A). The calculated disorder parameter \sigma^{2} =\langle r_{\rm A}^{2}\rangle-\langle r_{\rm A}\rangle^{2} for Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} is 0.005 for x = 0.6. In the case of other single-layer cuprates, such as La-based 214 and rare-earth substituted Bi2201 compounds, this value is so large that it would have lead to a considerable reduction in T_{c}--more than 50% reduction, or T_{c} reduction of more than 30K, from the T_{c} value of disorder-free (\sigma = 0) material.[4] It is likely that a similar T_{c} reduction took place in Sr_{2}CuO_{3+\delta} by Ba substitution, and an ideal T_{c} value of "disorder free" Sr_{1.4}Ba_{0.6}CuO_{3+\delta} would be 130 K or higher. Note that in the La214 and Bi2201 systems the A-site disorder is accompanied with charge disorder. So, it is inferable that dominant effect of A-site disorder on T_{c} is from charge disorder introduced by substitution of heterovalent cations which is not the case with the present system.

If there were a small but finite reduction in T_{c} due to the cation-size disorder then the T_{c} enhancement in Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} is indicative of substantial contribution from the expansion of the unit cell size. There might be two factors associated with the increase in lattice parameters which would affect the electronic parameters in the CuO_{2} plane; (1) increase in the apical-O distance, possibly caused by the increase in the c-axis lattice constant and (2) increase in the Cu-O in-plane bond length. The correlation between T_{c} and apical-O distance is empirically pointed out in the two contexts, a change in the second (third) nearest-neighbor hop

  ping parameter and a change in the Madelung energy. In a different context, Geballe suggests a possible role of apical-O atoms as negative-_U_ centers which promote pair formation.[26]

The in-plane Cu-O bond length changes from 1.89 A for Sr2CuO3+,6 to 1.95 A for Sr2-,BaCuO3+,6 at x = 0.6. The simplest copper oxide containing CuO2 plane is the so-called infinite-layer compound CaCuO2 wherein CuO2 plane alternatively stacks with Ca spacer along the c axis. The CuO2 plane in the infinite-layer compound is thus "free-standing" suffering only weak compressive or tensile stresses from the Ca layer. The Cu-O bond length in the infinite layer CaCuO2 is 1.93 A (Ref. [27]) that is supposed to be the in-plane bond length of free-standing CuO2 plane. In many materials the in-plane Cu-O bond length is appreciably shorter than 1.93 A, in which case the CuO2 plane shows buckling. On the other hand, the bond length is close to or slightly longer than 1.93 A in Tl- (Ref. [28]) and Hg-based (Ref. [29]) cuprates with _T_{c}_ higher than 90 K. From this, it seems that _flat_ CuO2 plane with expanded dimension provides a stage favorable for higher _T_{c}_ as shown in Fig. 5. In this sense, the _T_{c}_ enhancement with Ba substitution might be a consequence of the increasing Cu-O bonding length from 1.89 A for Sr2CuO3+,6 toward 1.93 A. In the context a much higher _T_{c}_ can be expected for Ba2CuO3+,6.

## IV Summary

In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized Ba-doped Sr2-,Ba2CuO3+,6 (0 \leq_x_\leq 0.6) with a K2NiF4-type structure using a high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis. The superconducting transition temperature with _T_{c}^{\rm max}_ = 98 K is achieved for x = 0.6. The increase in the unit cell size due to incorporation of large-size Ba cation is likely responsible for the enhancement of _T_{c}_ in this material. Since Ba is isovalent to Sr, the result also suggests that the disorder in the cation size introduced into the A sites has minor effect on _T_{c}_. It is argued that the increase in the apical-O distance and/or the increase in the in-plane Cu-O bond length that makes the CuO2 plane flat would favor higher _T_{c}_ in this material as well as other cuprates.

# Abstract

A series of new Sr2-,BaCuO3+,d (0 <= x <= 0.6) superconductors were prepared using high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis. A Rietveld refinement based on powder x-ray diffraction confirms that the superconductors crystallize in the K2-NiF4-type structure of a space group I4/_mm_ similar to that of LaCuO4 but with partially occupied apical oxygen sites. It is found that the superconducting transition temperature _T_c of this Ba substituted Sr2CuO3+,d superconductor with constant carrier-doping level, i.e., constant d is controlled not only by order/disorder of apical-O atoms but also by Ba content. _T_max = 98 K is achieved in the material with x = 0.6 that reaches the record value of _T_c among the single-layer copper oxide superconductors and is higher than _T_c = 95 K of Sr2CuO3+,d with optimally ordered apical-O atoms. There is Sr-site disorder in Sr2-,BaCuO3+,d which might lead to a reduction in _T_c. The result indicates that another effect surpasses the disorder effect that is related either to the increased in-plane Cu-O bond length or to elongated apical-O distance due to Ba substitution with larger cation size. The present experiment demonstrates that the optimization of local geometry out of the Cu-O plane can dramatically enhance _T_c in the cuprate superconductors.

## I Introduction

The enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature (_T_c) is one of key concerns for the studies of high-temperature superconductors (HTS). Crystallographically HTS consists of CuO2 plane that supports superconducting current as well as charge reservoir layer where doping takes place. In the hole-doped high-_T_c cuprates the charge reservoir is composed of two parts. That immediately outside the CuO2 plane is called as the apical oxygen (apical-O) layer since the oxygen atoms here are at the apical sites of a CuO6 octahedron or a CuO5 pyramid, and that outside the apical-O layer, is named the second nearest charge-reservoir layer. The cation in the apical-O layer is termed as the A-site cation. The apical-O and A-site cation are expected to be more heavily involved in the electronic state of the CuO2 plane than the second nearest charge reservoir layer via interaction with CuO2 plane since they have direct chemical bonding.

There seem to be several factors to "optimize" the electronic structures of CuO2 plane in order to achieve a higher _T_c. First of all, to induce HTS, one has to dope the parent Mott compounds, i.e., generate carriers into CuO2 plane. Consequently, dopant concentration or carrier density _n_h is the major factor controlling _T_c. It has been found that _T_c generally follows a parabolic relation as function of _n_h showing a maximum at an optimum doping _n_ ricating the tetragonal single-phase Sr2CuO3+\delta that was free of Cl containing phase or other contamination claimed in previous reports.[15] Our studies show that the maximum T_{c} can be achieved for Sr2CuO3+\delta with a nominal doping level at \delta=0.4 (actual \delta should be considerably smaller). We found that the remarkable enhancement of T_{c} at an almost constant doping level in this superconductor is associated with the ordering of the apical oxygen (dopant).[16]

Since superconductivity takes place in the CuO_{2} plane, the in-plane Cu-O bond length which is a measure of hybridization between Cu3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} and O2p_{x,y} orbitals as well as of superexchange coupling between neighboring Cu spins will be correlated with the superconducting order parameters. The in-plane electronic parameters are also controlled by the charger reservoir layer, in particular, by the apical-O distance from the CuO_{2} plane. Therefore, it is expected that T_{c} will also be pertinent to the average size of A site ion. In fact, it has been found that the mean A-site cation size indeed correlates to superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}). For instance, in La2-\delta(Sr, Ba)_{x}CuO_{4} system with the optimum doping level, the variation in T_{c} with A-site cation size has been investigated.[3] A systematic enhanced T_{c} with increasing A-site ion size were observed.[17, 18, 19]

In fact, the out-of-plane effects induce the geometrical distortions of the unit cell. Nunner _et al.[20]_ have proposed that the geometrical distortions of the unit cell may locally alter the electron-pairing interactions on microscale level. These interactions are much related with the T_{c} of the superconductors. In recent experiment, Slezak _et al.[21]_ had directly observed how variations in interatomic distances, presumably the apical-O distance within individual crystalline unit cells affect the maximum superconducting energy gap of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta}(Bi-2212).

In the present study, we report the effect of average A-site cation size or the change in the lattice constants on T_{c} for the A_{2}CuO_{3+\delta} (A = Sr, Ba) superconductors. Since both Sr and Ba are isovalent alkaline earth element, their substitution does not change the doped carrier density when the excess oxygen content \delta is kept constant. We have successfully synthesized a series of Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} (x\leq 0.6) superconductors under high pressures and high temperatures. We found that T_{c} can be significantly enhanced to 98 K in Ba-substituted Sr_{2}CuO_{3+\delta}

## II II. Experimental

The samples were synthesized in two steps. In the first step, a series of Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3} (0 \leq x\leq 0.6) precursors were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction method from high-purity raw materials SrCO_{3}, BaCO_{3}, and CuO. The powder mixture in an appropriate ratio was ground together in an agate mortar and then calcined at 950 ^{\circ}C for approximately three days in air with two intermediate grindings in order to obtain single-phase samples. In the second step, the precursors were mixed with SrO_{2} and CuO to form the nominal composition of Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} in a dry glove box that was used to prevent the degradation of hygroscopic reagents. The materials were then subjected to high-pressure synthesis under 6 GPa pressure and at 1000 ^{\circ}C for 30 min using a cubic-anvil-type high pressure facility, and then quenched to room temperature before releasing the pressure. The role of SrO_{2} is to create an oxygen atmosphere during the high-pressure synthesis as previously described in the related Cl series[22, 23, 24] or Sr_{2}CuO_{3+\delta} (Ref. [16]) superconductors. Here the excess oxygen content \delta is controlled by the oxidizer amount SrO_{2} in the nominal starting materials. In order to study the ordering effect of the dopant atoms (apical oxygen distribution), we also annealed several samples in the temperature range between 150 and 300 ^{\circ}C for 12 h under 1 atm N_{2} atmosphere in a tube furnace.

The structure of obtained polycrystalline samples was identified by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) collected with 2 \theta steps of 0.02^{\circ} and 3 s counting time in the range of 5 ^{\circ}\leq 2 \theta\leq 120^{\circ} using Cu K\alpha radiation. The x-ray diffraction pattern was refined with Rietveld method using winplotr program. The DC magnetic susceptibility was measured using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer in an external magnetic field of 20 Oe for both zero-field-cooling and field-cooling (FC) modes.

## III III. Results and Discussion

By changing the Sr to Ba ratio and keeping a constant hole concentration (fixed \delta), a series of Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} (0 \leq x\leq 0.6) superconductors were prepared using the high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis. Since a maximum T_{c} is attained in SrCuO_{3+\delta} at nominal \delta=0.4, we keep all the Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} samples with the same oxygen content in order to separate out the A-site effects. The x-ray diffraction patterns show purely tetragonal K_{2}NiF_{4}-type phase with space group I4/mmm in the entire x range up to 0.6. Note that no information on the apical-O configuration can be extracted directly from the x-ray diffraction. Assuming the La_{2}CuO_{4} prototype tetragonal structure but with partially occupied apical oxygen, we refined the crystal structure of Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} using the Rietveld method. Figure 2 shows the XRD pattern of a sample with the nominal composition Sr_{1.84}Ba_{0.16}CuO_{3+\delta}, together with the results of Rietveld refinement. A reasonable R_{\rm wp} (weighed-profile R factor) factor of 8.76% was obtained as shown in Table 1, indicating that the structural model is a reasonable one. Figure 3 shows the cell parameters of the samples as a function of Ba content x for Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} As compared with Sr_{2}CuO_{3+\delta}[16] both a- and c-axis lattice constants of Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} are expanded

  due to larger Ba ion incorporated to the Sr sites. For example, the lattice parameters increased from a = 3.79 A, c = 12.50 A for Sr2CuO3+- (Ref. [16]) to a = 3.89 A, and c = 12.78 A for Sr1,Ba0,CuO3+- b respectively.

In Fig. 4(a) we present the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility measured for the as-prepared samples Sr2-xBaCuO3+- _δ_ with x = 0.16, 0.32, and 0.6 in the FC mode at an external field of 20 Oe. The superconducting transition temperature _Tc_ increases with increasing Ba content. Starting from _Tc_ = 75 K for Sr2CuO3+- _δ_ a maximum _Tc_ = 98 K is reached at x = 0.6. The Meissner volume fraction of Sr2-xBaCuO3+- _δ_ sample is more than 10% at 5 K, suggesting the nature of bulk superconductivity. The Sr2-xBaCuO3+- _δ_ sample with x > 0.6 are mixed phases, showing no superconducting transition.

In the case of Sr2CuO3+- _δ_, _Tc_ can be enhanced to 95K by post annealing at relatively low temperatures (~250 degC), probably because the apical-O atoms order optimally. However, the Ba substituted samples very easily decomposes upon heating at ambient pressure. It is found that Sr2-xBaCuO3+- _δ_ becomes unstable with increasing Ba content due to the fact that the high-pressure synthesized materials with larger unit cell is usually thermodynamically meta-stable at ambient pressure. In Fig. 4(b) we show the postannealing effect on Sr1,9Ba0,1CuO3.4. _Tc_ increases from the initial 80K (as prepared) to 91K by annealing at 250 degC but its superconducting volume fraction appreciably decreases. With increasing Ba content to x = 0.32, _Tc_ = 88 K of as-prepared sample is enhanced to 92K by annealing at 200 degC, but annealing at higher temperatures results in degradation of superconductivity [Fig. 4(c)]. Though the nominal composition is also Sr1,68Ba0,32CuO3+- _Tc_ of the sample is a little lower than the _Tc_ of the sample in Fig. 4(a).In fact, besides the nominal composition, the _Tc_ of the material varies a little depending on the synthesis temperature. In the case of x = 0.6, as prepared _Tc_ reaches 98K, already exceeding the maximum _Tc_ = 95 K of Sr2CuO3+- _δ_ with optimally ordered apical-O atoms. We annealed the sample of Sr1,4Ba0,6CuO3.4 but its superconductivity is lost immediately upon heating even at 150 degC indicating the heavily metastable nature of the Ba substituted sample. It seems that the highest _Tc_ of the present superconductor is realized in the vicinity of a structural instability.

For Sr2CuO3+- _δ_ the electron diffraction (ED) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements are possible to investigate the evolution of the structural modulation associated with the apical-O ordering with post-annealing temperature.[16] A modulated structure with C2/_m_ symmetry is found for as-prepared sample with _Tc_ = 75 K which evolves into a _Pmmm_ modulation structure with _Tc_ = 95 K after annealing at 250 degC. Supposing that the as-prepared samples have the same C2/_m_ modulated structure as that of. Sr2CuO3+- _δ_ then the result indicates that _Tc_ is

  remarkably enhanced by Ba substitution without changing the ordering pattern of apical-O atoms. Unfortunately, the neutron or ED and TEM investigation are not possible at the moment for the Ba-substituted materials since it is difficult to obtain sufficient amount of samples, and they are unstable against heating due to exposure to high-density electron-beam flux. So, we cannot rule out the possibility that the Ba incorporation tends to stabilize the Pmmm modulation corresponding to the "optimal" apical-O ordering in Sr_{2}CuO_{3+\delta} with T_{c} = 95 K. In either case since T_{c} = 98 K achieved in the as-prepared sample of x = 0.6 exceeds the highest T_{c} of Sr_{2}CuO_{3+\delta} it is certain that the larger A-site cation size leads to higher T_{c} in the present system.

It is also noted that the substituted Ba in the Sr_{2}CuO_{3+\delta} plays dual roles: one is to expand the unit cell size and the other is to create disorder due to cation size mismatch between Sr^{2+} and Ba^{2+}. The previous investigation of La_{2}CuO_{4}-related superconductors suggested that T_{c} depends both on the average cation size and the A-site cation disorder. It was also suggested that, if the degree of disorder does not change, T_{c} tends to increase with increasing A-site cation size \langle r_{\rm A}\rangle, while T_{c} decreases with increasing the A-site disorder at the constant average \langle r_{\rm A}\rangle. In the present Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} system, T_{c} of as-prepared sample increases with A-site cation size, achieving 98 K at x = 0.6. The result suggests that the _larger_ A-site cation size is an important ingredient for the enhancement of T_{c} in Sr_{2}CuO_{3+\delta} while the A-site disorder arising from cation size mismatch between Sr and Ba appears to have relatively small effect on T_{c}. Since Sr and Ba are isovalent alkaline earth element, their substitution does not change the carrier density, nor introduce charge disorder, which is different from ordinary A-site substitution with heterovalence ions such as that in La_{2-x}^{3+}Sr_{x}^{2+}CuO_{4}[17, 18, 19]. From the Shannon table,[25] the ionic radius for Ba^{2+} (Sr^{2+}) is 1.47 A (1.31 A). The calculated disorder parameter \sigma^{2} =\langle r_{\rm A}^{2}\rangle-\langle r_{\rm A}\rangle^{2} for Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} is 0.005 for x = 0.6. In the case of other single-layer cuprates, such as La-based 214 and rare-earth substituted Bi2201 compounds, this value is so large that it would have lead to a considerable reduction in T_{c}--more than 50% reduction, or T_{c} reduction of more than 30K, from the T_{c} value of disorder-free (\sigma = 0) material.[4] It is likely that a similar T_{c} reduction took place in Sr_{2}CuO_{3+\delta} by Ba substitution, and an ideal T_{c} value of "disorder free" Sr_{1.4}Ba_{0.6}CuO_{3+\delta} would be 130 K or higher. Note that in the La214 and Bi2201 systems the A-site disorder is accompanied with charge disorder. So, it is inferable that dominant effect of A-site disorder on T_{c} is from charge disorder introduced by substitution of heterovalent cations which is not the case with the present system.

If there were a small but finite reduction in T_{c} due to the cation-size disorder then the T_{c} enhancement in Sr_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{3+\delta} is indicative of substantial contribution from the expansion of the unit cell size. There might be two factors associated with the increase in lattice parameters which would affect the electronic parameters in the CuO_{2} plane; (1) increase in the apical-O distance, possibly caused by the increase in the c-axis lattice constant and (2) increase in the Cu-O in-plane bond length. The correlation between T_{c} and apical-O distance is empirically pointed out in the two contexts, a change in the second (third) nearest-neighbor hop

  ping parameter and a change in the Madelung energy. In a different context, Geballe suggests a possible role of apical-O atoms as negative-_U_ centers which promote pair formation.[26]

The in-plane Cu-O bond length changes from 1.89 A for Sr2CuO3+,6 to 1.95 A for Sr2-,BaCuO3+,6 at x = 0.6. The simplest copper oxide containing CuO2 plane is the so-called infinite-layer compound CaCuO2 wherein CuO2 plane alternatively stacks with Ca spacer along the c axis. The CuO2 plane in the infinite-layer compound is thus "free-standing" suffering only weak compressive or tensile stresses from the Ca layer. The Cu-O bond length in the infinite layer CaCuO2 is 1.93 A (Ref. [27]) that is supposed to be the in-plane bond length of free-standing CuO2 plane. In many materials the in-plane Cu-O bond length is appreciably shorter than 1.93 A, in which case the CuO2 plane shows buckling. On the other hand, the bond length is close to or slightly longer than 1.93 A in Tl- (Ref. [28]) and Hg-based (Ref. [29]) cuprates with _T_{c}_ higher than 90 K. From this, it seems that _flat_ CuO2 plane with expanded dimension provides a stage favorable for higher _T_{c}_ as shown in Fig. 5. In this sense, the _T_{c}_ enhancement with Ba substitution might be a consequence of the increasing Cu-O bonding length from 1.89 A for Sr2CuO3+,6 toward 1.93 A. In the context a much higher _T_{c}_ can be expected for Ba2CuO3+,6.

## IV Summary

In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized Ba-doped Sr2-,Ba2CuO3+,6 (0 \leq_x_\leq 0.6) with a K2NiF4-type structure using a high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis. The superconducting transition temperature with _T_{c}^{\rm max}_ = 98 K is achieved for x = 0.6. The increase in the unit cell size due to incorporation of large-size Ba cation is likely responsible for the enhancement of _T_{c}_ in this material. Since Ba is isovalent to Sr, the result also suggests that the disorder in the cation size introduced into the A sites has minor effect on _T_{c}_. It is argued that the increase in the apical-O distance and/or the increase in the in-plane Cu-O bond length that makes the CuO2 plane flat would favor higher _T_{c}_ in this material as well as other cuprates.
