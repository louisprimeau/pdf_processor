###### Abstract

Iron was substituted for copper in YBa2(Cu1-_x_Fe_x_)3O7-_s_ for 0 <= x <= 0.33. Superconducting transition temperatures and lattice parameters have been determined as a function of Fe content. The orthorhombic distortion \Delta a_{0} = 2(b - a)/(a + b) decreased to zero near x = 0.03. Beyond x = 0.03 the structure appears tetragonal. For compositions 0 <= x <= 0.15 the superconducting critical temperature T_{c} decreased smoothly from T_{c} = 90 K to below 4.2 K. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the spacing between the twin boundaries decreased from ~200 nm for x = 0 to ~20 nm for x = 0.02 before the twins disappeared for x >= 0.03. The sharp streaks in TEM diffraction patterns were interpreted as due to the twin boundary layers whose thickness varied from ~1 nm for the pure to ~2 for the Fe (_x_ = 0.02) containing specimen. A tweed structure in the TEM image and associated diffuse streaks along the (110) directions in electron diffraction pattern appeared for x > 0.015. This observation suggests that the structure consists of fine (< 5 nm) orthorhombic domains, each domain having the twinkle crystallographic relation with its neighbors. Rietveld refinement of powder neutron diffraction for x = 0.10 and 0.167 determined that Fe substituted primarily on the Cu "chain" site, and for every two atoms of Fe substituted, approximately one extra oxygen is incorporated in the Cu-O plane.

## I Introduction

Superconducting YBa2Cu2O7 (1:2:3), discovered by Wu _et al._, [1] has been extensively studied. Replacement of Y by other rare-earth elements does not change the superconducting properties of the compounds even when the rare-earth element carries a large magnetic moment. [2]^{-}[4] Cu is assumed to play an important role in these superconductors since CuO2 planes are common to the superconductors containing La, Y, Bi, and Tl. In YBa2Cu2O7 there are two distinct sites for \cdotCu, one forming CuO2 planes, the other forming CuO chains. Replacement of Cu by other transition metals may provide information about the nature of superconductivity in this compound. If the transition metal substitutes for Cu preferentially on either one of the two sites, then that fact could be used to determine the relative importance of these two distinct Cu sites for superconductivity.

YBa2Cu3O7-_s_ undergoes a structural phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic (_T_-_O_) when temperature is lowered below 700degC as oxygen is taken into the sample. [5] At the same time, twins form due to the strain associated with the phase transformation. The effect of twins on superconductivity of this ceramic superconductor has been a topic of speculation for both theorists and experimentalists. One of the motivations for this work is to investigate the role of twin boundaries on superconducting properties of the high-_T__c_ oxide. There is a variety of theories about the effect of twin boundaries on the superconducting properties of YBa2Cu3O7. Fang _et al._ [6] proposed the twin boundary region has higher T_{c} than the matrix. If this is the case the effect should be observable for the spacing less than 10-20 nm. Mueller _et al._ [7] assumed that the twin boundaries play an important role in high-_T__c_ oxides. Chaudhari [8] suggested that twin boundaries act as strong flux pinning centers which result in higher critical current in thin films. Deutscher and Muller [9] proposed that twin boundaries are non-orthorhombic and nonsuperconducting or weakly superconducting regions.

Much has been published [10]^{-}[26] on the effect of Fe substitutions for Cu on superconducting properties. While sample preparation methods appear to dramatically affect superconducting properties, these reports generally find that T_{c} falls as Fe replaces Cu. However, except for that basic observation, there is little agreement on the details of the dependence of T_{c} on Fe content. Also, since Fe substitution results in a reduced \Delta a_{0}[ = 2(_b - a)/(_a_ + b)] for x < 0.03 and a tetragonal phase for x >= 0.03, [10] one expects the twin-boundary spacings to change with Fe concentration. Thus, in order to study in detail the effect of the substitution on both superconducting properties and the microstructures, we substituted Fe for Cu to give the nominal compositions YBa2(Cu1-_x_Fe_x_)3O7-_s_ with 0 <= x <= 0.33. While x-ray and neutron-diffraction techniques indicate that beyond x = 0.03 the room-temperature structure is tetragonal (rather than orthorhombic), electron diffraction suggests the existence of mutually perpendicular microdomains of orthorhombic regions. Fe appears to be soluble up to near x = 0.15. We report changes in superconducting temperatures and in microstructure as a function of Fe content x in the com pounds YBa2(Cu1-_x_Fex)3O7-_b_. Results from superconductivity measurements, electrical resistivity data, x-ray and neutron-diffraction studies, optical micrography to determine grain size and homogeneity, electron microprobe for composition, and transmission electron microscopy to study microstructural variations, give a comprehensive and consistent picture of the effects of Fe substitution for Cu.

The primary microstructural modifications occurring due to the Fe substitution are (1) reduction of the spacing between the twin boundaries for x <= 0.02, (2) increase of the twin-boundary layer thickness with the Fe substitutions, (3) disappearance of the boundaries for x >= 0.03 and appearance of a "tweedlike" structure for x >= 0.015, and (4) disappearance of the tweed structure for x >= 0.1. Possible mechanisms for reduction of the twin spacing and formation of the tweedlike structure as well as the influence of these microstructural changes on superconducting properties are discussed in detail. A preliminary report on some of this work was reported earlier. [27]

Although this paper describes the microstructural changes of 1:2:3 oxides due to Fe substitution for Cu, it should be pointed out that similar changes are also observed when other elements are substituted for Cu, e.g., Ga, [10, 11, 28] Al, [10, 29] and Co, [10, 11, 30] which are known to induce an orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transformation.

## II Experimental Details

The samples were prepared by mixing the appropriate amounts of Y2O3, BaCO3, CuO, and Fe2O3 powders in an agate mortar. In order to achieve the best results, the powders were ground thoroughly (40 min for a 5-g sample) before the first firing. The intermediate grindings were fast (about 15 min) to avoid possible effects of moisture in the atmosphere on the samples. The ground powders were pressed into pellets and fired in the air at 900 degC twice. Finally, they were heated in oxygen at 970 degC for more than 40 h, followed by an anneal at 665 degC for 8 h, and then furnace cooled to below 100 degC. The resulting samples were well crystallized with shiny facets on the interior. Some of the grains were as large as 200 _m_m in one direction for the pure YBa2Cu2O7. An electron microprobe analysis was used to verify the composition of the samples. The results indicated that the final compositions of the oxides were very close to the nominal compositions for x <= 0.15. For example, the Fe contents for x = 0.05 and 0.15 were measured to be x = 0.049 +- 0.002 and 0.142 +- 0.006, respectively. X-ray powder-diffraction scans were taken with a conventional setup utilizing Cu _Ka_ radiation and a diffracted-beam monochromator. All samples with Fe content x = 0 to 0.15 showed no observable impurity peaks in the x-ray-diffraction pattern above the 2% level of detection.

Powder-neutron-diffraction measurements on 8-g samples with x = 0.10 and x = 0.167 were carried out on the triple-axis spectrometer H4S at the Brookhaven High Flux Beam Reactor (HFBR). The experimental configuration consisted of a pyrolytic graphite monochromator and analyzer in the (002) and (004) settings respectively, and the following collimation: 20' in pile, 40' monochromator sample, 40' sample analyzer, and 20' analyzer detector. The neutron wavelength was 0.2370(1) nm. A pyrolytic graphite filter was used to suppress higher-order wavelengths. The data for the sample with x = 0.10 was obtained at room temperature by step scanning at 0.1deg intervals. The sample having x = 0.167 was mounted in a cryostat and cooled to 10 K for the diffraction measurements.

The superconducting transition temperature _Tc_ was measured by mutual inductance, and the dc electrical resistivity was measured by the standard four-probe technique. The transmission electron microscopy was performed on a JEM-100C electron microscope operated at 120 keV.

The majority of the TEM specimen (at least two for each composition) were prepared by slicing sintered pellets, ultrasonically cutting out 3-mm disks, mechanically dimpling to ~25 _m_m thick, initially ion milling at 4 kV at 8-10deg tilt, and finally, milling at a reduced angle of ~6deg or reduced voltage of 2 kV. To verify that no artifacts were being introduced during the ion-milling process at room temperature, several specimens of ground pellets suspended on holey carbon films were examined, as well as samples ion milled using a liquid-nitrogen-cooled stage. The only observable differences among the specimens prepared by these various methods is that the ion-milled samples had a very thin amorphous layer on the surface.

## III Results

### X-ray diffraction

X-ray-diffraction patterns revealed systematic changes in lattice parameters as Fe content was varied. The detailed changes in peaks 006, 020, and 200 are illustrated in Fig. 1. For x = 0.03, the 200 and 020 have merged. A slight broadening of this peak relative to the 006 gives evidence that b is not yet quite equal to a. In fact, close inspection at the sample by TEM shows a small portion of the sample to be twinned (orthorhombic), the remainder free of twins (tetragonal). Thus, the composition x = 0.03 is apparently near the _T_-_O_ boundary. Slight compositional inhomogeneity (Fe or O) in the specimens may explain the simultaneous presence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases.

The lattice parameters of the samples were calculated by a least-squares fit to positions from the x-ray diffraction pattern with an internal silicon standard. The results are shown in Fig. 2 and listed in Table 1. Since the symmetry of the structure is not known, we cannot state with certainty that the crystal structure is tetragonal even when a and b are equal for x = 0.03. This value of x for the _T_-_O_ boundary is higher than those in published work, i.e., x = 0.023. [10, 11] At Fe contents above x = 0.03, a increases slightly with x. Assuming that all or most of the Fe substitutes onto Cu(1) (chain site) atoms, the changes in a and b below x = 0.03 are probably caused by the disordering of the oxygen atoms due to random occupation of Fe on the Cu(1) site. The observed change in c for low  substitution (_x_ < 0.03) is of the same magnitude as the uncertainty of our parameter determination. At higher Fe content (_x_ > 0.05), c decreases slightly. This is different from the case of the orthorhombic-to-the tetragonal phase change due to oxygen deficiency, where c monotonically increases with decreasing oxygen content. The overall volume of the unit-cell lattice increases as more Fe is substituted for Cu.

A specimen with nominal Fe content x = 0.33 showed a significant amount of a second phase (BaFeO3) and lattice parameters similar to those of the sample with x = 0.15 as shown in Table 1. Both of these observations suggest that, at least with our preparation methods, the solubility limit of Fe is approximately x = 0.15.

The lattice parameters of our samples are basically in agreement with published work.[10,11,13] The relatively higher c we observed for higher Fe content may possibly be due to relatively higher oxygen content in our samples.

### Neutron diffraction for x = 0.10 and x = 0.167

Structure refinements on the specimens x = 0.10 and 0.167 were carried out with a local version of the Rietveld-Hewat program.[31,32] The peaks, assumed to be Gaussian with a small Lorentzian component to the peak profile, were described in the pseudo-Voigtian approximation, and the background was refined together with the structure. In the case of the x = 0.167 specimen, diffraction peaks from the aluminum specimen holder were excluded from consideration. The diffraction data were indexed on a tetragonal cell with no systematic absences (space group P4/_mmm_). A few peaks, all smaller than 1% of the most intense peak, could not be indexed with this cell and were excluded from the refinement. The structure of YBa2Cu2CoO7-_d_ (Ref. [33]) was used as a starting model, using Fe instead of Co. The overall Fe composition was restricted to the nominal composition and the occupancies of the O(1) and O(2) sites were set to one. Significant improvement of the refinements were ob

  tained using a statistical distribution of O(3) in a less symmetric site (_x_, +- ,0) and by refining a preferred orientation parameter. The fits for x = 0.10 and 0.167 are shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). The resulting structure models for both samples are listed in Table 2.

The structure refinements confirm the picture that iron goes mainly onto Cu(1) sites. However, in part because of the similarity of the scattering factors of Cu and Fe, the present data cannot exclude the possibility that some of Fe substitutes onto Cu(2). The total oxygen contents for these specimens were determined in the refinement to be about 7.15 (_d_ = - 0.15) for x = 0.10 and 7.23 (_d_ = - 0.23) for x = 0.167. The lattice parameters determined in the profile refinement at room temperature for x = 0.10 agree with those determined by x-ray diffraction, within the range of estimated standard deviations (esd). Also, the neutron data of the x = 0.167 sample were analyzed for the presence of peaks originating from long-range antiferromagnetic ordering. No evidence for such peaks was found. Upper limits of integrated intensities for peaks with indexing of (1/+- ,/2) were at least one order of magnitude smaller than what would be expected for the type of magnetic ordering found in YBa2Cu3O6 (Ref. [36]) or YBa2Cu2CoO7.33

### Superconducting transition temperature

Superconducting transition temperature T_{c} measured by mutual inductance for the Fe substituted specimens are shown in Fig. 4. The filled circles are the midpoints of the transition and the vertical bars represent 10-90% of the whole transition. The width of the transition increases as the Fe content increases. The values of T_{c} of our specimens are higher than those observed by some others for the same Fe contents. For example, for x = 0.033, Tarascon _et al._10 report T_{c} between 70-55 K, while for our x = 0.03 specimen, T_{c} is between 85-80 K. The discrepancy may in part be caused by a difference in oxygen content, which depends on the detailed specimen preparation process.

The T_{c} versus Fe content curve has a negative curvature, a behavior reminiscent of T_{c} versus concentration of paramagnetic impurities.37 de magnetic-susceptibility measurements38 show that the temperature dependence of normal state _kh_ of the Fe-doped samples follows Curie-Weiss law. These results suggest that the Fe atoms form localized magnetic moments.

### Electrical resistivity

The electrical resistivities as a function of temperature for six specimens, 0 <= x <= 0.05, are shown in Fig. 5. All the samples up to x = 0.075 show metallic behavior but, for x = 0.10 between T = 150 K and the onset of superconductivity, resistance rises as temperature is reduced. In agreement with the ac susceptibility measurements, the resistively measured superconducting transition width increases as Fe content increases. For YBa2Cu3O7, the resistive transition width is only about 0.2 K, while for an Fe-containing sample with x = 0.05, the transition width is about 7 K. It was also noted that the zero-resistance temperatures in Fig. 5 for all Fe contents are very near the onset (10% value) of the ac susceptibility transition for the same x (see Fig. 4).

The resistivities of the samples at room temperature and 100 K are plotted versus Fe content in Fig. 6. The resistivity values increase almost linearly with x. The resistivity ratio _r_(300 K)/_r_(100 K) is about 3 for x = 0 sample and about 2 for x = 0.05. The systematic nature of variations in resistivity values and of temperature dependence of resistivity suggest that the specimens have been prepared in a consistent and reproducible manner.

### Transmission electron microscopy and microstructures

The results of transmission electron microscopy performed on the specimens of YBa2(Cu1-_x_Fe_x_)3O7-_d_ for compositions of 0 <= x <= 0.15 are shown in Figs. 7-16.

  They illustrate that the primary microstructural changes due to the substitution of Fe for Cu are (a) a systematic variation in the spacing between the twin boundaries and the eventual disappearance of twins and (b) the appearance and the disappearance of a tweed morphology and the associated diffuse streaks along the \langle 110\rangle directions in electron-diffraction (ED) patterns. These observed changes are separately discussed in detail for six composition ranges: (1) x = 0, (2) x = 0.005-0.015, (3) x = 0.02, (4) x = 0.025, (5) x = 0.03-0.05, and (6) x = 0.10-0.15. Then, in the discussion section, the interpretation of the images and the ED patterns, which vary with Fe, are discussed in terms of possible causes of these changes and their effects on superconducting properties of these specimens.

#### v.1.1 YBa2Cu3O7: x = 0

Figure 7 displays a typical set of the (110)-type twins. These are formed as the result of the structural transformation (a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase) in YBa2Cu3O7 during cooling from high temperature (-970 degC).39 A corresponding ED pattern with the zone axis along the [001] direction is also shown in Fig. 8 with clearly separated (_hk_ 0) spots, indicating that these spots are from the twins and the boundaries are along the (110)

Figure 8: A selected area electron-diffraction pattern from the area shown in Fig. 6. Note that the twin boundary is parallel to the [_hh_ 0] direction and the split at the diffraction spots is zero at the [_hh_ 0] and maximum at the [_hh_ 0].

The inset indicates the degree of the split at the \langle 220\rangle reflection due to the twin formation. In this case g is parallel to the twin boundary and the direction of the split is perpendicular to the boundary and g.

  planes. Shown with the dark-field image of the twins (Fig. 7) are the (220) diffraction spots, illustrating the orientation of the split between the two diffraction spots due to the matrix and the twins. In this case, the twin boundaries are parallel to the [110] direction and the split is in the [\bar{1}10] direction. In the specimens of pure YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, the typical spacing between the twin boundaries was > 200 nm and is larger than normally reported values (\sim100 nm).

Also, in the area where the twin-boundary spacing is <=100 nm, very sharp streaks at the zero- and low-order diffraction spots are observed. These streaks are in the direction perpendicular to the twin boundaries and are due to very thin layers of a nonorthorhombic material at

The diffraction condition was (200) to show the tweed in both of the \langle hh0\rangle directions. The inset shows the reduced separation of the (220) split and the increased intensity on the diffuse scattering streak.

  the twin boundaries.[40] From the length of the streak, the thickness of the twin-boundary layer is estimated to be 1.0-1.5 nm. These streaks are very weak and are not well reproduced in glossy photographs.

iii.2.2 YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Fe_{x})_{3}O_{7-x}: 0.005 \leq x\leq 0.015

In this composition range, the following subtle changes, which are more obvious in the specimens with higher Fe contents, begin to appear in the ED patterns and in the images.

(a) A second set of weak diffuse streaks along the [110] directions, which form a cross pattern, also appears at x=0.015 as shown in the inset of Fig. 9. (Unfortunately, these diffuse streaks do not reproduce.) These are easier to observe at higher-order diffraction spots. Associated with the above streaks are very fine (< 5 nm) elongated features between the boundaries. Both of these are thought to be an early stage of formation of the tweed structure, which will be discussed in detail for 0.03 \leq x\leq 0.05.

(b) The separation between the split twin-diffraction spots decreases with increasing Fe content, as expected from the lattice parameter measurements by x-ray diffraction (see Fig. 2).

(c) Also, as shown in Fig. 9, the spacing between the twin boundaries of these Fe-substituted specimens de

The electron-diffraction pattern is taken by tilting \sim15^{\circ} away from the \langle 001\rangle zone along the [hh0] direction.

The insets show (a) the presence of and (b) the absence of the diffuse scattering in the \langle 100\rangle and the \langle 110\rangle zones, respectively.

  creases significantly from those for the pure oxide in Fig. 7. Furthermore, many narrow twins terminate in the matrix rather than at the grain boundaries or at the intersecting twins. These terminating twins are rare in "well-prepared" specimens of pure YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ such as the one in Fig. 7.

(d) Finally, the sharp streaks at the low-order diffraction spots become shorter and less sharp than those in the pure specimen. The shorter streaks indicate that the twin-boundary layers are thicker (i.e., 1.3-2.0 nm) than those for the pure specimen, while the lack of definition suggests that the interface between the matrix and the boundary layers is not as sharp as for the pure case.

#### iii.2.3 YBa2(Cu1-_x_Fe_x_)3O7-_x_ x = 0.02

At this composition, a drastic change in microstructure is apparent in Figs. 10(a) and 10(b). The typical spacing between the twin boundaries is ~20 nm in contrast to several tens of nm or greater for the specimens with concentrations of Fe below x < 0.02. Also shown in Fig. 10(b) are very fine crossing twins, which appear in a considerable number of the grains. In these TEM specimens, approximately 80 out of 100 grains observed contain these fine twins. However, the remaining portion of the grains exhibit relatively larger twins which are similar to those shown in Fig. 9. Occasionally, there are areas with small (10-20 nm) twins which are widely dispersed in the matrix. Most of these twins terminate in the matrix. In order to check the possibility that a variation in Fe concentration might be associated with the large differences in the twin-boundary spacing, chemical analysis of these areas was performed in the microscope using an energy dispersive x-ray detector. No detectable difference in the Fe content was measured among these areas. However, considering the limited sensitivity of this type of analysis, it is still possible to have small local variations in the compositions which might cause variations in the spacings.

Compared with specimens having lower Fe contents, the intensity of the diffuse streaks along <110> directions at diffraction spots is greater and the distance between the two split spots is smaller (see Fig. 10 inset). These diffuse streaks form a clear cross pattern. In some areas the presence of a very fine tweedlike structure is evident between the widely spaced twin boundaries. However, at this composition, the image contrast from the tweedlike structure is still weak and difficult to show in reproduction of the images. The diffuse streaks and the tweedlike structure will be further discussed for specimens with higher Fe contents. The very sharp streaks at the central region of the ED pattern became stronger than those for x <= 0.015 due to the high density of the twins. However, their length is further decreased, indicating the boundary-layer thickness is approximately 1.6-2.4 nm.

#### iii.2.4 YBa2(Cu1-_x_Fe_x_)3O7-_x_ x = 0.025

At x = 0.025, a large fraction of the specimens contain twins of relatively large spacings (see Fig. 11), similar in size to specimens with x = 0.015, while very fine twins such as seen for x = 0.02 are also found in the remaining areas. Also, the diffuse streaks in the <110> directions as well as the tweedlike structure which coexists with the twins are prominent in Fig. 11. Furthermore, the split twin diffraction spots have nearly converged to one spot as shown in the inset in Fig. 11 and the sharp streaks at the low-order diffraction spots are no longer observed indicating that the distinction between the boundary layer and the matrix became insignificant.

#### iii.2.5 YBa2(Cu1-_x_Fe_x_)3O7-_x_ 0.03 <= x <= 0.05

In this composition range, the twins are absent in the transmission electron micrograph image, except occasionally in small regions. The tweedlike structure is the only microstructural feature observed in transmission electron microscopy. This is illustrated in Fig. 12, where a grain was oriented such that the electron beam was approximately parallel to the <001> direction. From the image in Fig. 12, the tweedlike structure appears to consist of mutually perpendicular platelets which are ~100 nm long and ~5 nm wide in the _a_-_b_ plane. Associated with this structure are, as before, the diffuse streaks along both of the <110> directions at each of the diffracted spots as shown in the ED pattern of a specimen with x = 0.03 (Fig. 12). (While the diffuse streak is weak and not easily reproduced in prints, it is clearly illustrated in the inset in Fig. 12 for the <220> spot.) In order to further study the nature of these streaks, the diffraction patterns in two other zones (<100> and <110>) are illustrated in Fig. 13 (_a_ and b, respectively). In the enlarged <03_1> diffraction spots, as shown in the inset in Fig. 14, weak diffuse scattering extends toward the <0k0> directions and the width of the scattering along <001> directions is less than ~1 of the distance between the <00_1>_ and <00_1>_. The latter indicates that the individual small platelike region of the tweedlike structure extends approximately 10-20 nm along the c direction. This observation is contrary to the result of Bordet _et al._41 in which the streak extended significantly in the <001> direction, implying that the tweed structure is not coherent in the <001> direction. (This is also different from the oxygen-vacancy ordering in the CuO planes in oxygen-deficient YBa2Cu3O7-_x_, where the ordering is not coherent from one CuO plane to another along the c axis. In that case the streaks due to the ordered plane extend along the <001> direction.42) The diffraction pattern along the <110> zone [Fig. 14(b)] does not show diffuse scattering along the <hh0> directions and only weak scattering along the <001> directions. From this we conclude that one of the streaks at the <hh0>-type spots in the <001> zone diffraction pattern in Fig. 13 is likely to be due to double scattering (e.g., at the <hh0> spots the streak along the [110] direction is due to double scattering and the streak along the [\overline{1}10] is real and due to the plateletlike regions which are parallel to the [110] direction). Another important feature is that the length of the streak increases as the order of the diffraction spot increases in the reciprocal space away from the central beam. (Since the intensity of the diffused streaks are so weak, this effect is not observable in Fig. 13 but is easily seen in the negatives of the ED patterns.) The above re  sults indicate that these streaks are not simply due to the small size of the platelets but also to an additional source, such as a variation in \Delta a or strain at the boundary as will be discussed later.

#### iii.3.6 YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Fe_{x})_{3}O_{7-g}: x = 0.10-0.15

For Fe contents x = 0.10 and 0.15, there is no tweed structure in the image, at least at our magnification of 50-100 K but, some very fine microstructural features are visible. (See Fig. 15). However, the diffuse streaks, which were seen at lower compositions, are still observed (as shown in the inset of the figure), but they are significantly weaker than those in the specimens with 0.03 \leq x \leq 0.05. Furthermore, for x = 0.15, additional diffuse scattering is observed around the \langle hk\,0\rangle diffracted beams between the (00_l_) and (00l + 1) planes in the reciprocal space as shown in Fig. 16. This may be due to ordering of Fe or oxygen in the CuO planes. The details of this aspect of the work will be discussed elsewhere.[43]

## IV Discussion

### Electron microscopy

#### iv.1.1 The twin-boundary layers

Very sharp streaks at the low-order diffraction spots in the ED patterns are observed for x \leq 0.02. The lengths of these streaks decrease with increasing contents of Fe. As stated earlier, from the lengths, the thickness of the non-orthorhombic layers are estimated to be 1.0-1.5 nm at x = 0 and 1.6-2.4 nm at x = 0.02. (However it is possible that the reduction in length of the streaks may be partly due to roughening of the interface between the matrix and the layer which is associated with the formation of the early stage of the tweedlike structure.)

Although, we have observed the twin-boundary layers in a number of other specimens, (e.g., Zn- and Ni-substituted 1:2:3) by the electron diffraction technique,[40] the existence of such layers has not been widely discussed previously.[44, 45] This is surprising considering its significance in understanding the role of the twin boundaries in determining superconducting properties of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. Bary[45] reported possible observation of a "twin boundary phase " in _some_ of the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} specimens. Using high-resolution electron microscopy, he observed regions approximately 3 monolayers thick (\sim0.8 nm), which were not orthorhombic, at the twin boundary. On the other hand, Sarikaya and co-workers[44] suggested that the twin boundary is nonorthorhombic and has a thickness of 3-5 nm as measured by a converging beam electron-diffraction technique. Our estimate for the layer thickness for the pure YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is in accordance with that of Barry. Furthermore, we believe that the twin boundaries in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} or similar specimens always contain thin layers which are different from the orthorhombic matrix. However, when the twin-boundary spacing is large, it is difficult to observe these layers due to the limited area contributing to the intensity of the streaks. The structural difference between the layer and the matrix may be so slight that it is not easily observed in the high-resolution microscopy.

#### iv.1.2 Twin-boundary spacings

In order to discuss effects of the Fe substitution for Cu on the spacing between the twin boundaries, we will first consider the general factors which affect the spacing. According to an equation derived by Welch,[46] the twin-boundary spacing d depends on the grain size g, the orthorhombicity,

\[\phi \simeq (1 - [a/b]) \simeq \Delta a_{0} = 2(b - a)/(b + a)\ ,\]

the interface energy of the twin boundary g and the elastic shear modulus M as

\[d \simeq (g\gamma/cM\phi^{2})^{1/2}\ ,\]

where c is a constant of the order of the unity and g is measured _along the twin boundary in the_ \langle 110\rangle_direction_. Note that this expression is similar to that obtained by Arlt and Sasko[47] but their value of the constant c is 1/128\pi. Sarikaya and co-workers[44] have also derived a slightly different expression for d, which does not contain the grain size dependence. Recent experimental results[48, 49] have shown that dependence of d on the grain size is indeed \sim\sqrt{g}. Furthermore, a careful measurement of d and g along the \langle 110\rangle direction indicated that the constant c is approximately one rather than 1/128\pi.[50]

Although the size of the grains decreases with increasing Fe content, this decrease cannot alone explain the reduction in the twin spacing which was observed in this study. The grain size at x = 0.02 compared to that at x = 0 is reduced by about a factor of 4. This reduction in the grain size predicts only a factor of two smaller twin boundary spacings. This predicted variation is in fact much smaller than that observed. Thus, we will neglect this factor for the present discussion.

The orthorhombicity _ph_ (or \Delta a_{0}) (as measured by x-ray diffraction) diminishes with increasing Fe content x. Since d is inversely proportional to the orthorhombicity \Delta a_{0}, our expression predicts the spacing to increase with the increasing Fe content. However, the twin-boundary spacings actually decreases with the addition of Fe up to x = 0.02, as shown in Figs. 7-10. At x = 0.025, approximately one-half of the specimens contain relatively large twins, the other half fine twins. Finally, the twins disappear for x \cong 0.03. This variation in the spacing indicates that the substitution of Fe for Cu lowers the value of the twin-boundary surface energy g, favoring a larger number of the twins for x \leq 0.02 than for the pure 1:2:3. (This is also suggested by Shaw _et al._[48] based on the expression by Arlt and Sasko.[47]) At x = 0.025 the situation becomes less clear. However, it is reasonable to suggest that at this composition, the effects of decreasing values of g and (\Delta a_{0})^{2} are comparable in determining the values of d, and small local variation in the Fe and/or O content may cause the local differences in d which were observed (i.e., \sim 50% very fine and \sim 50% medium-size twins). Thus, the variations in the spacing d are basically due to the  lowering of the interfacial energy g by Fe additions. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to estimate the value of g in this system and at present it is not clear how such small substitutions of Fe can influence g so strongly, e.g., \gamma(x = 0)/\gamma(x = 0.02) = 10^2 since _d_(_x_ = 0) = 200 nm and _d_(_x_ = 0.02) = 20 nm. However, the above result is not unreasonable in light of the fact that replacement of Fe in the CuO chain has a strong effect on determining the location of O in the CuO planes and has increased the thickness of the twin-boundary layers and thus reduced the strain energy of the boundary in comparison to those for the pure oxide.

The variations in the twin-boundary spacing due to the substitution of Fe for Cu are qualitatively described by assuming a greater reduction in g with Fe than in (D_a_0)2 in Eq. (1). However, the tweed structure coexists with the twins for 0.015 <= x <= 0.025. As described below, the tweed structure is thought to consist of fine (<= 5 mm) orthorhombic domains related by the twinlike boundaries. (See Sec. IV.1.3). It is not clear why formation of these twinlike domains does not release the strain energy due to the transformation from the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase to avoid formation of the twins. It appears from the above result that the twins are primarily determined by the average D_a_0 (such as measured by x-ray-diffraction techniques) rather than the local D_a_ of the scale of < 5 nm in the domains.

#### iv.1.3 The "tweed" structure and the diffuse streaks

Formation of the tweed morphology is quite common in the 1:2:3 system where the substitution of other elements such as Ga28, Al29, and Co30 causes the crystallographic structural changes from the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase at sufficient levels of the substitution of Cu by each of these elements (e.g., x - 0.03). A similar tweed structure, somewhat coarser than the present one and an associated diffuse scattering, can also be observed in oxygen deficient YBa2Cu3O7 - d.30,51,52 There have been some attempts to interpret the diffuse scattering and the tweedlike morphology in these systems.30,40,53,54

The first observation of the diffuse streaks and the tweedlike structure was reported by Iijima _et al._52 in YBa2Cu3O7 - d by heating the specimens in an electron microscope. The size of the tweedlike structure was significantly greater than those observed in the present study of alloy YBa2Cu3O7. Independently, a similar observation was also made by van Tendeloo and Amelinckx55 by the same technique. The latter attributed the streaks to very fine twins without specifying the size while Iijima _et al._52 suggested that these are from the small twin_like_ structure (~16 nm). In a later article, Ichihashi _et al._30 proposed that this structure is formed by having small elongated islands of the tetragonal phase in the orthorhombic phase. The islands are separated from the orthorhombic matrix by thin transition layers. More recently, based on high-resolution electron microscopy, Roth _et al._54 and Sastry, Wordenweber, and Freyhardt56 suggested without detailed explanations that the diffuse streaks in YBa2(Cu0.95Fe0.05)3O7 - d are due to very small 2-5 nm orthorhombic domains. [Although Sastry _et al._ claimed that they have measured a = 0.383 and b = 0.39 nm for a Fe-substituted specimen from a high-resolution electron micrograph, this is unlikely. In order to measure D_a_ of ~1%, it is required to measure distances for 50-100 lattice planes in the two directions, i.e., a and b. Since the domain is ~5 nm, each domain can contain only 10-15 (= 5/0.38) lattice planes in the a or b direction. Thus, it makes it nearly impossible to measure a and b to the accuracy of 1%.]

On the other hand, Bordet _et al._41 proposed that the streaks are due to closely spaced linear clusters of Fe cation chains extending along the (110) directions and separating the orthorhombic domains. In addition, a study of YBa2(Cu1 - x Fex_)3O7 - d by high-resolution electron microscopy led Hiroi _et al._53 to conclude that the streaks and the tweedlike structures for x = 0.04 are due to microdomains of the orthorhombic phase. They furthermore suggested that the domains are squares and each corner of the square domain is occupied by Fe atoms. However, it seems likely that the position of the Fe atoms in the lattice determined at temperatures well above the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase transformation (> 700 degC). Thus, it is difficult to imagine any interaction forces capable of ordering a small number of Fe atoms in the ways described. Although the above suggestions (the microdomains of the orthorhombic phase and the fine embryos of the tetragonal phase in the orthorhombic phase), appears to be appropriate in describing the tweedlike structure and the associated diffuse streaks in some cases, we find neither one of them is sufficient or detailed enough to satisfactorily explain the evolution of the microstructures and the ED patterns in the YBa2(Cu1 - x Fex_)3O7 - d with 0.05 <= x <= 0.15.

In order to discuss possible microstructural origins of the tweedlike structure and the streaks in the ED patterns of YBa2(Cu1 - x Fex_)3O7 - d specimens, it is important to note the following: Common to the electron diffraction observations for 0.03 <= x <= 0.15 are narrow streaks of diffuse scattering along the 11101 (and the [110]) direction through most of the reflections, thus forming a cross. Exceptions are the [_hh1_] (and the [_hh1_]) reflections where there is a diffuse streak in only one direction, namely, the [110] and [110] direction, respectively. Another exception occurs at the (00_l_) reflections where there appear to be no diffuse streaks. The above is also true for the diffuse streak portion of the ED patterns for x = 0.015-0.025 but is not as clear as in the cases for x <= 0.03.

A distribution of diffuse scattering similar to that described above is expected for twin related domains when the (110) and the equivalent (110) planes are the twin planes for a continuous range of _b_/_a_ ratios ranging from 1.0 to _b_/_a_ = 3.88/3.82 = 1.016 (i.e., the _b_/_a_ ratio of YBa2Cu3O7) within the illuminated area. This would apply even if the domains were large, provided the electron beam had a sufficient diameter to probe statistically all _b_/_a_ ratios. In that case, the majority would be tetragonal.

Very thin coherent domains which are twin related will also give similar streaks of diffuse scattering due to their limited thickness (shape effect) even for the unlikely situation that a = b [if, e.g., the chains of oxygen atoms are rotated 90deg across the (110) twin boundary].

  An observable difference between these two extreme cases is that for larger microtwins with _b/a_=1 the length of the diffuse streaks will increase with increasing distance from the (001) axis in reciprocal space observed for 0.015\leq x\leq 0.05. For the other extreme where _a = b_, the length of the streaks would be the same for all reflections (as seen for x = 0.10 and 0.15). Due to multiple scattering, which tends to redistribute the diffuse scattering among the reflections, it can be difficult to distinguish between these two cases. There is, however, evidence that at lower Fe content (_x_ <= 0.05) _b/a_ > 1, whereas for x = 0.10 and x = 0.15 the shape effect dominates and masks any possible effect of _b/a_ > 1. Also, it is expected that the first case would result in a stronger contrast than the second in the images as shown in Figs. 12 and 15, respectively. Furthermore, the first description is very similar to that proposed by Ichihashi _et al._[30] if one interprets their transition layers and tetragonal islands as the regions where a_{a} semiperiodically varies along the [110] directions. In this composition region, the contrast in the image and the streaks is also possibly due to the strain along the [110] direction. [57]

From these observations one cannot deduce the exact structure of the domains. As suggested by others, the observations do strongly suggest that we are dealing with microtwins in the (110) planes, possibly with a _b/a_ ratio less than for pure YBa2Cu3O7 but larger than 1. The thickness of the microtwins decreases from ~4.0 to ~1.5 nm when the Fe content increases from 3% to 15%. For x = 0.15 we also observe a tendency towards periodic twins with a period of 3.87 x 6/2 = 1.63 nm. This observation will be discussed in more detail elsewhere. [43]

### Superconducting properties

The possibility of enhanced values of T_{c} at the twin boundary has been suggested in Refs. [6] and [7]. Increased values of T_{c} in YBa2Cu3O7 near grain boundaries is predicted to become observable when the twin-boundary spacing is on the order of ~20 nm or smaller. However, in spite of the fact that the spacing is reduced to 10-20 nm for specimens with Fe x = 0.02, T_{c} continues to decrease smoothly with increasing Fe content. This suggests that the existence of such high-_T__c_ regions at the twin boundary is unlikely, although it can be argued that the addition of Fe has changed the nature of the boundary such that the condition leading to higher T_{c} at the boundary is destroyed. In fact, the boundary layer is non-orthorhombic and is expected to have a reduced superconductivity as suggested by Deutscher and Muller. [9]

In trying to determine various aspects of crystallographic and/or structural properties which may be important for achieving high critical temperatures in these oxides, the possible importance of the bond length [Cu(1) - O(1)] between the Cu in the chain and the oxygen just above (sometimes called "sticks") was pointed out based on studies of oxygen-deficient. [58] Co-doped YBa2Cu3O7 - x. [59] However, if the lattice parameter c along the (001) directions is taken as an indication of the change in the length of the "stick," the variation in the length, which is associated with the Fe substitutions, is negligible since the value of c decreased only by ~0.14% from x = 0 to 0.15. [In pure YBa2Cu3O7 - s, the increase (~1.3%) in c is accompanied by a decrease (~1.67%) in the "stick" length for the variation in oxygen of d = 0 to d = 0.8. Thus, the above assumption in regard to the relationship between the changes in c and the "stick" length is likely to be appropriate.] Thus, in contrast to the Co substituted YBa2Cu3O7, [59] the value of T_{c} in this system diminished to zero at x = 0.15 in spite of the very small change in the apparent "stick" length.

While there are a limited number of direct measurements of the [Cu(1) - O(1)] bond length by neutron and x-ray diffraction for x <= 0.167 (Refs. [24], [41], and [54]) in the YBa2(Cu1 - x Fe x )3O7 - d system, the values reported by these studies are not consistent enough to draw a definite conclusion on the relationship between the bond length and the values of T_{c}. For example, our neutron-diffraction data show that the lengths of 0.1853, 0.1840, and 0.1849 nm for x = 0, x = 0.10, and 0.167, respectively. (The length for x = 0.167 was adjusted for the room-temperature value using the data of Roth _et al._[54] at 3 and 300 K for x = 0.05.) Roth _et al._[54] reports that the length is 0.1829 and 0.1855 nm for x = 0.05 measured by neutron and x-ray diffraction, respectively, while Bordet _et al._[41] measured the length to be 0.1838 nm for x = 0.07 by neutron diffraction. Furthermore, Roth _et al._[54] believe that their single-crystal x-ray-diffraction result is more precise than their neutron data on the length. Also, Tao _et al._[24] report the length of the Cu(1) - O(1) bond to be 0.1791 nm in their YBa2Cu2,5Fe0.5O7 - d (this is equivalent to x = 0.167). However, the value of the "_c_" parameter for this specimen is 1.1637 nm which is substantially greater than our values for c for the same composition. It is likely that the amount of oxygen in their specimen is less than the maximum which the composition can absorb. Thus, in the Fe-substituted YBa2Cu3O7 - d, a clear dependence of T_{c} on the "stick" length could not be established from the neutron- and x-ray-diffraction data in contrast to the result which was reported by Miceli _et al._[59] on the Co-substituted YBa2Cu3O7 - d. This could be due to the fact that such a relationship does not apply at least for the Fe-substituted system and/or the precision in the determinations of the length is not high enough, particularly when it is measured on different specimens by different groups of researchers.

A measurement of the carrier concentration n as determined by the Hall coefficient [60] indicates a smooth decrease of n as the Fe concentration is increased, in the same manner as for oxygen deficient YBa2Cu3O7 - d. This result supports the importance of large n for achieving high-_T__c_ values [61] and suggests that the increasing values of resistivity with x of YBa2(Cu1 - x Fe x )3O7 - d are associated with reduced carrier density. Furthermore, measurements of electronic specific-heat coefficient for the similar Fe-substituted specimens [62] show decreasing strength of specific-heat jumps at T_{c} with increasing Fe. This may also be due to the decrease of n. However, it is not clear how the Fe atoms in the CuO plane influence the CuO2 plane without significant changes in the length of the "stick," since the CuO2 plane is generally accepted as the  region of the crystal where the essential part of superconductivity is taking place in these high-T_{c} layered oxides.

The most interesting aspects of the influence of microstructural variations due to the Fe substitution are its effect on intragrain critical current densities and critical magnetic fields. Due to the fact that the only obvious defects in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} are the twin boundaries and that critical current densities of single-crystal or oriented films and bulk single crystals are very high in the _a-b_ plane, the twin boundaries are thought to be strong pinning sites.[6, 63, 64] If this is the case, the value of J_{c} for a specimen with x = 0.02 Fe should be significantly higher than that for the pure YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. Furthermore, the fine tweedlike structure observed for the specimens with 0.03\leq x\leq 0.05 may also be expected to act as effective pinning sites for the flux lines. However, disappointingly and as also found by other,[65, 66] preliminary measurements of magnetization on _c_-oriented powders of these specimens indicate that the intragrain J_{c} decreases with increasing Fe in spite of microstructural changes which appear to be favorable for flux pinning.[67] The details of this result as well as the effects of other elemental substitutions such as Ni, Cr, Zn, Al, and Ga on the intragrain current densities will be discussed elsewhere. However, some preliminary suggestions can be made. (1) Either the twin-boundary planes are not effective pinning sites, or the substitution of Fe for Cu in the CuO plane modifies the structure of the twin-boundary region (e.g., widen the boundary thickness) such that the pinning strength of the boundary is reduced. (The spatial modulation of the electronic properties, which is pertinent for pinning, becomes too gradual for flux pinning in the tweedlike structure.) (2) The reduction in the carrier density may also influence the values of the intragrain critical current densities in the Fe-substituted 1:2:3 oxides. Finally, (3) as described by Wodenweber _et al._,[65] the reduction in the H_{C2} with the Fe substitution reduces the value of J_{c}.

###### Abstract

Iron was substituted for copper in YBa2(Cu1-_x_Fe_x_)3O7-_s_ for 0 <= x <= 0.33. Superconducting transition temperatures and lattice parameters have been determined as a function of Fe content. The orthorhombic distortion \Delta a_{0} = 2(b - a)/(a + b) decreased to zero near x = 0.03. Beyond x = 0.03 the structure appears tetragonal. For compositions 0 <= x <= 0.15 the superconducting critical temperature T_{c} decreased smoothly from T_{c} = 90 K to below 4.2 K. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the spacing between the twin boundaries decreased from ~200 nm for x = 0 to ~20 nm for x = 0.02 before the twins disappeared for x >= 0.03. The sharp streaks in TEM diffraction patterns were interpreted as due to the twin boundary layers whose thickness varied from ~1 nm for the pure to ~2 for the Fe (_x_ = 0.02) containing specimen. A tweed structure in the TEM image and associated diffuse streaks along the (110) directions in electron diffraction pattern appeared for x > 0.015. This observation suggests that the structure consists of fine (< 5 nm) orthorhombic domains, each domain having the twinkle crystallographic relation with its neighbors. Rietveld refinement of powder neutron diffraction for x = 0.10 and 0.167 determined that Fe substituted primarily on the Cu "chain" site, and for every two atoms of Fe substituted, approximately one extra oxygen is incorporated in the Cu-O plane.

## I Introduction

Superconducting YBa2Cu2O7 (1:2:3), discovered by Wu _et al._, [1] has been extensively studied. Replacement of Y by other rare-earth elements does not change the superconducting properties of the compounds even when the rare-earth element carries a large magnetic moment. [2]^{-}[4] Cu is assumed to play an important role in these superconductors since CuO2 planes are common to the superconductors containing La, Y, Bi, and Tl. In YBa2Cu2O7 there are two distinct sites for \cdotCu, one forming CuO2 planes, the other forming CuO chains. Replacement of Cu by other transition metals may provide information about the nature of superconductivity in this compound. If the transition metal substitutes for Cu preferentially on either one of the two sites, then that fact could be used to determine the relative importance of these two distinct Cu sites for superconductivity.

YBa2Cu3O7-_s_ undergoes a structural phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic (_T_-_O_) when temperature is lowered below 700degC as oxygen is taken into the sample. [5] At the same time, twins form due to the strain associated with the phase transformation. The effect of twins on superconductivity of this ceramic superconductor has been a topic of speculation for both theorists and experimentalists. One of the motivations for this work is to investigate the role of twin boundaries on superconducting properties of the high-_T__c_ oxide. There is a variety of theories about the effect of twin boundaries on the superconducting properties of YBa2Cu3O7. Fang _et al._ [6] proposed the twin boundary region has higher T_{c} than the matrix. If this is the case the effect should be observable for the spacing less than 10-20 nm. Mueller _et al._ [7] assumed that the twin boundaries play an important role in high-_T__c_ oxides. Chaudhari [8] suggested that twin boundaries act as strong flux pinning centers which result in higher critical current in thin films. Deutscher and Muller [9] proposed that twin boundaries are non-orthorhombic and nonsuperconducting or weakly superconducting regions.

Much has been published [10]^{-}[26] on the effect of Fe substitutions for Cu on superconducting properties. While sample preparation methods appear to dramatically affect superconducting properties, these reports generally find that T_{c} falls as Fe replaces Cu. However, except for that basic observation, there is little agreement on the details of the dependence of T_{c} on Fe content. Also, since Fe substitution results in a reduced \Delta a_{0}[ = 2(_b - a)/(_a_ + b)] for x < 0.03 and a tetragonal phase for x >= 0.03, [10] one expects the twin-boundary spacings to change with Fe concentration. Thus, in order to study in detail the effect of the substitution on both superconducting properties and the microstructures, we substituted Fe for Cu to give the nominal compositions YBa2(Cu1-_x_Fe_x_)3O7-_s_ with 0 <= x <= 0.33. While x-ray and neutron-diffraction techniques indicate that beyond x = 0.03 the room-temperature structure is tetragonal (rather than orthorhombic), electron diffraction suggests the existence of mutually perpendicular microdomains of orthorhombic regions. Fe appears to be soluble up to near x = 0.15. We report changes in superconducting temperatures and in microstructure as a function of Fe content x in the com pounds YBa2(Cu1-_x_Fex)3O7-_b_. Results from superconductivity measurements, electrical resistivity data, x-ray and neutron-diffraction studies, optical micrography to determine grain size and homogeneity, electron microprobe for composition, and transmission electron microscopy to study microstructural variations, give a comprehensive and consistent picture of the effects of Fe substitution for Cu.

The primary microstructural modifications occurring due to the Fe substitution are (1) reduction of the spacing between the twin boundaries for x <= 0.02, (2) increase of the twin-boundary layer thickness with the Fe substitutions, (3) disappearance of the boundaries for x >= 0.03 and appearance of a "tweedlike" structure for x >= 0.015, and (4) disappearance of the tweed structure for x >= 0.1. Possible mechanisms for reduction of the twin spacing and formation of the tweedlike structure as well as the influence of these microstructural changes on superconducting properties are discussed in detail. A preliminary report on some of this work was reported earlier. [27]

Although this paper describes the microstructural changes of 1:2:3 oxides due to Fe substitution for Cu, it should be pointed out that similar changes are also observed when other elements are substituted for Cu, e.g., Ga, [10, 11, 28] Al, [10, 29] and Co, [10, 11, 30] which are known to induce an orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transformation.

## II Experimental Details

The samples were prepared by mixing the appropriate amounts of Y2O3, BaCO3, CuO, and Fe2O3 powders in an agate mortar. In order to achieve the best results, the powders were ground thoroughly (40 min for a 5-g sample) before the first firing. The intermediate grindings were fast (about 15 min) to avoid possible effects of moisture in the atmosphere on the samples. The ground powders were pressed into pellets and fired in the air at 900 degC twice. Finally, they were heated in oxygen at 970 degC for more than 40 h, followed by an anneal at 665 degC for 8 h, and then furnace cooled to below 100 degC. The resulting samples were well crystallized with shiny facets on the interior. Some of the grains were as large as 200 _m_m in one direction for the pure YBa2Cu2O7. An electron microprobe analysis was used to verify the composition of the samples. The results indicated that the final compositions of the oxides were very close to the nominal compositions for x <= 0.15. For example, the Fe contents for x = 0.05 and 0.15 were measured to be x = 0.049 +- 0.002 and 0.142 +- 0.006, respectively. X-ray powder-diffraction scans were taken with a conventional setup utilizing Cu _Ka_ radiation and a diffracted-beam monochromator. All samples with Fe content x = 0 to 0.15 showed no observable impurity peaks in the x-ray-diffraction pattern above the 2% level of detection.

Powder-neutron-diffraction measurements on 8-g samples with x = 0.10 and x = 0.167 were carried out on the triple-axis spectrometer H4S at the Brookhaven High Flux Beam Reactor (HFBR). The experimental configuration consisted of a pyrolytic graphite monochromator and analyzer in the (002) and (004) settings respectively, and the following collimation: 20' in pile, 40' monochromator sample, 40' sample analyzer, and 20' analyzer detector. The neutron wavelength was 0.2370(1) nm. A pyrolytic graphite filter was used to suppress higher-order wavelengths. The data for the sample with x = 0.10 was obtained at room temperature by step scanning at 0.1deg intervals. The sample having x = 0.167 was mounted in a cryostat and cooled to 10 K for the diffraction measurements.

The superconducting transition temperature _Tc_ was measured by mutual inductance, and the dc electrical resistivity was measured by the standard four-probe technique. The transmission electron microscopy was performed on a JEM-100C electron microscope operated at 120 keV.

The majority of the TEM specimen (at least two for each composition) were prepared by slicing sintered pellets, ultrasonically cutting out 3-mm disks, mechanically dimpling to ~25 _m_m thick, initially ion milling at 4 kV at 8-10deg tilt, and finally, milling at a reduced angle of ~6deg or reduced voltage of 2 kV. To verify that no artifacts were being introduced during the ion-milling process at room temperature, several specimens of ground pellets suspended on holey carbon films were examined, as well as samples ion milled using a liquid-nitrogen-cooled stage. The only observable differences among the specimens prepared by these various methods is that the ion-milled samples had a very thin amorphous layer on the surface.

## III Results

### X-ray diffraction

X-ray-diffraction patterns revealed systematic changes in lattice parameters as Fe content was varied. The detailed changes in peaks 006, 020, and 200 are illustrated in Fig. 1. For x = 0.03, the 200 and 020 have merged. A slight broadening of this peak relative to the 006 gives evidence that b is not yet quite equal to a. In fact, close inspection at the sample by TEM shows a small portion of the sample to be twinned (orthorhombic), the remainder free of twins (tetragonal). Thus, the composition x = 0.03 is apparently near the _T_-_O_ boundary. Slight compositional inhomogeneity (Fe or O) in the specimens may explain the simultaneous presence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases.

The lattice parameters of the samples were calculated by a least-squares fit to positions from the x-ray diffraction pattern with an internal silicon standard. The results are shown in Fig. 2 and listed in Table 1. Since the symmetry of the structure is not known, we cannot state with certainty that the crystal structure is tetragonal even when a and b are equal for x = 0.03. This value of x for the _T_-_O_ boundary is higher than those in published work, i.e., x = 0.023. [10, 11] At Fe contents above x = 0.03, a increases slightly with x. Assuming that all or most of the Fe substitutes onto Cu(1) (chain site) atoms, the changes in a and b below x = 0.03 are probably caused by the disordering of the oxygen atoms due to random occupation of Fe on the Cu(1) site. The observed change in c for low  substitution (_x_ < 0.03) is of the same magnitude as the uncertainty of our parameter determination. At higher Fe content (_x_ > 0.05), c decreases slightly. This is different from the case of the orthorhombic-to-the tetragonal phase change due to oxygen deficiency, where c monotonically increases with decreasing oxygen content. The overall volume of the unit-cell lattice increases as more Fe is substituted for Cu.

A specimen with nominal Fe content x = 0.33 showed a significant amount of a second phase (BaFeO3) and lattice parameters similar to those of the sample with x = 0.15 as shown in Table 1. Both of these observations suggest that, at least with our preparation methods, the solubility limit of Fe is approximately x = 0.15.

The lattice parameters of our samples are basically in agreement with published work.[10,11,13] The relatively higher c we observed for higher Fe content may possibly be due to relatively higher oxygen content in our samples.

### Neutron diffraction for x = 0.10 and x = 0.167

Structure refinements on the specimens x = 0.10 and 0.167 were carried out with a local version of the Rietveld-Hewat program.[31,32] The peaks, assumed to be Gaussian with a small Lorentzian component to the peak profile, were described in the pseudo-Voigtian approximation, and the background was refined together with the structure. In the case of the x = 0.167 specimen, diffraction peaks from the aluminum specimen holder were excluded from consideration. The diffraction data were indexed on a tetragonal cell with no systematic absences (space group P4/_mmm_). A few peaks, all smaller than 1% of the most intense peak, could not be indexed with this cell and were excluded from the refinement. The structure of YBa2Cu2CoO7-_d_ (Ref. [33]) was used as a starting model, using Fe instead of Co. The overall Fe composition was restricted to the nominal composition and the occupancies of the O(1) and O(2) sites were set to one. Significant improvement of the refinements were ob

  tained using a statistical distribution of O(3) in a less symmetric site (_x_, +- ,0) and by refining a preferred orientation parameter. The fits for x = 0.10 and 0.167 are shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). The resulting structure models for both samples are listed in Table 2.

The structure refinements confirm the picture that iron goes mainly onto Cu(1) sites. However, in part because of the similarity of the scattering factors of Cu and Fe, the present data cannot exclude the possibility that some of Fe substitutes onto Cu(2). The total oxygen contents for these specimens were determined in the refinement to be about 7.15 (_d_ = - 0.15) for x = 0.10 and 7.23 (_d_ = - 0.23) for x = 0.167. The lattice parameters determined in the profile refinement at room temperature for x = 0.10 agree with those determined by x-ray diffraction, within the range of estimated standard deviations (esd). Also, the neutron data of the x = 0.167 sample were analyzed for the presence of peaks originating from long-range antiferromagnetic ordering. No evidence for such peaks was found. Upper limits of integrated intensities for peaks with indexing of (1/+- ,/2) were at least one order of magnitude smaller than what would be expected for the type of magnetic ordering found in YBa2Cu3O6 (Ref. [36]) or YBa2Cu2CoO7.33

### Superconducting transition temperature

Superconducting transition temperature T_{c} measured by mutual inductance for the Fe substituted specimens are shown in Fig. 4. The filled circles are the midpoints of the transition and the vertical bars represent 10-90% of the whole transition. The width of the transition increases as the Fe content increases. The values of T_{c} of our specimens are higher than those observed by some others for the same Fe contents. For example, for x = 0.033, Tarascon _et al._10 report T_{c} between 70-55 K, while for our x = 0.03 specimen, T_{c} is between 85-80 K. The discrepancy may in part be caused by a difference in oxygen content, which depends on the detailed specimen preparation process.

The T_{c} versus Fe content curve has a negative curvature, a behavior reminiscent of T_{c} versus concentration of paramagnetic impurities.37 de magnetic-susceptibility measurements38 show that the temperature dependence of normal state _kh_ of the Fe-doped samples follows Curie-Weiss law. These results suggest that the Fe atoms form localized magnetic moments.

### Electrical resistivity

The electrical resistivities as a function of temperature for six specimens, 0 <= x <= 0.05, are shown in Fig. 5. All the samples up to x = 0.075 show metallic behavior but, for x = 0.10 between T = 150 K and the onset of superconductivity, resistance rises as temperature is reduced. In agreement with the ac susceptibility measurements, the resistively measured superconducting transition width increases as Fe content increases. For YBa2Cu3O7, the resistive transition width is only about 0.2 K, while for an Fe-containing sample with x = 0.05, the transition width is about 7 K. It was also noted that the zero-resistance temperatures in Fig. 5 for all Fe contents are very near the onset (10% value) of the ac susceptibility transition for the same x (see Fig. 4).

The resistivities of the samples at room temperature and 100 K are plotted versus Fe content in Fig. 6. The resistivity values increase almost linearly with x. The resistivity ratio _r_(300 K)/_r_(100 K) is about 3 for x = 0 sample and about 2 for x = 0.05. The systematic nature of variations in resistivity values and of temperature dependence of resistivity suggest that the specimens have been prepared in a consistent and reproducible manner.

### Transmission electron microscopy and microstructures

The results of transmission electron microscopy performed on the specimens of YBa2(Cu1-_x_Fe_x_)3O7-_d_ for compositions of 0 <= x <= 0.15 are shown in Figs. 7-16.

  They illustrate that the primary microstructural changes due to the substitution of Fe for Cu are (a) a systematic variation in the spacing between the twin boundaries and the eventual disappearance of twins and (b) the appearance and the disappearance of a tweed morphology and the associated diffuse streaks along the \langle 110\rangle directions in electron-diffraction (ED) patterns. These observed changes are separately discussed in detail for six composition ranges: (1) x = 0, (2) x = 0.005-0.015, (3) x = 0.02, (4) x = 0.025, (5) x = 0.03-0.05, and (6) x = 0.10-0.15. Then, in the discussion section, the interpretation of the images and the ED patterns, which vary with Fe, are discussed in terms of possible causes of these changes and their effects on superconducting properties of these specimens.

#### v.1.1 YBa2Cu3O7: x = 0

Figure 7 displays a typical set of the (110)-type twins. These are formed as the result of the structural transformation (a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase) in YBa2Cu3O7 during cooling from high temperature (-970 degC).39 A corresponding ED pattern with the zone axis along the [001] direction is also shown in Fig. 8 with clearly separated (_hk_ 0) spots, indicating that these spots are from the twins and the boundaries are along the (110)

Shown with the dark-field image of the twins (Fig. 7) are the (220) diffraction spots, illustrating the orientation of the split between the two diffraction spots due to the matrix and the twins. In this case, the twin boundaries are parallel to the [110] direction and the split is in the [\bar{1}10] direction. In the specimens of pure YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, the typical spacing between the twin boundaries was > 200 nm and is larger than normally reported values (\sim100 nm).

Also, in the area where the twin-boundary spacing is <=100 nm, very sharp streaks at the zero- and low-order diffraction spots are observed. These streaks are in the direction perpendicular to the twin boundaries and are due to very thin layers of a nonorthorhombic material at

  the twin boundaries.[40] From the length of the streak, the thickness of the twin-boundary layer is estimated to be 1.0-1.5 nm. These streaks are very weak and are not well reproduced in glossy photographs.

iii.2.2 YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Fe_{x})_{3}O_{7-x}: 0.005 \leq x\leq 0.015

In this composition range, the following subtle changes, which are more obvious in the specimens with higher Fe contents, begin to appear in the ED patterns and in the images.

(a) A second set of weak diffuse streaks along the [110] directions, which form a cross pattern, also appears at x=0.015 as shown in the inset of Fig. 9. (Unfortunately, these diffuse streaks do not reproduce.) These are easier to observe at higher-order diffraction spots. Associated with the above streaks are very fine (< 5 nm) elongated features between the boundaries. Both of these are thought to be an early stage of formation of the tweed structure, which will be discussed in detail for 0.03 \leq x\leq 0.05.

(b) The separation between the split twin-diffraction spots decreases with increasing Fe content, as expected from the lattice parameter measurements by x-ray diffraction (see Fig. 2).

(c) Also, as shown in Fig. 9, the spacing between the twin boundaries of these Fe-substituted specimens de

  creases significantly from those for the pure oxide in Fig. 7. Furthermore, many narrow twins terminate in the matrix rather than at the grain boundaries or at the intersecting twins. These terminating twins are rare in "well-prepared" specimens of pure YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ such as the one in Fig. 7.

(d) Finally, the sharp streaks at the low-order diffraction spots become shorter and less sharp than those in the pure specimen. The shorter streaks indicate that the twin-boundary layers are thicker (i.e., 1.3-2.0 nm) than those for the pure specimen, while the lack of definition suggests that the interface between the matrix and the boundary layers is not as sharp as for the pure case.

#### iii.2.3 YBa2(Cu1-_x_Fe_x_)3O7-_x_ x = 0.02

At this composition, a drastic change in microstructure is apparent in Figs. 10(a) and 10(b). The typical spacing between the twin boundaries is ~20 nm in contrast to several tens of nm or greater for the specimens with concentrations of Fe below x < 0.02. Also shown in Fig. 10(b) are very fine crossing twins, which appear in a considerable number of the grains. In these TEM specimens, approximately 80 out of 100 grains observed contain these fine twins. However, the remaining portion of the grains exhibit relatively larger twins which are similar to those shown in Fig. 9. Occasionally, there are areas with small (10-20 nm) twins which are widely dispersed in the matrix. Most of these twins terminate in the matrix. In order to check the possibility that a variation in Fe concentration might be associated with the large differences in the twin-boundary spacing, chemical analysis of these areas was performed in the microscope using an energy dispersive x-ray detector. No detectable difference in the Fe content was measured among these areas. However, considering the limited sensitivity of this type of analysis, it is still possible to have small local variations in the compositions which might cause variations in the spacings.

Compared with specimens having lower Fe contents, the intensity of the diffuse streaks along <110> directions at diffraction spots is greater and the distance between the two split spots is smaller (see Fig. 10 inset). These diffuse streaks form a clear cross pattern. In some areas the presence of a very fine tweedlike structure is evident between the widely spaced twin boundaries. However, at this composition, the image contrast from the tweedlike structure is still weak and difficult to show in reproduction of the images. The diffuse streaks and the tweedlike structure will be further discussed for specimens with higher Fe contents. The very sharp streaks at the central region of the ED pattern became stronger than those for x <= 0.015 due to the high density of the twins. However, their length is further decreased, indicating the boundary-layer thickness is approximately 1.6-2.4 nm.

#### iii.2.4 YBa2(Cu1-_x_Fe_x_)3O7-_x_ x = 0.025

At x = 0.025, a large fraction of the specimens contain twins of relatively large spacings (see Fig. 11), similar in size to specimens with x = 0.015, while very fine twins such as seen for x = 0.02 are also found in the remaining areas. Also, the diffuse streaks in the <110> directions as well as the tweedlike structure which coexists with the twins are prominent in Fig. 11. Furthermore, the split twin diffraction spots have nearly converged to one spot as shown in the inset in Fig. 11 and the sharp streaks at the low-order diffraction spots are no longer observed indicating that the distinction between the boundary layer and the matrix became insignificant.

#### iii.2.5 YBa2(Cu1-_x_Fe_x_)3O7-_x_ 0.03 <= x <= 0.05

In this composition range, the twins are absent in the transmission electron micrograph image, except occasionally in small regions. The tweedlike structure is the only microstructural feature observed in transmission electron microscopy. This is illustrated in Fig. 12, where a grain was oriented such that the electron beam was approximately parallel to the <001> direction. From the image in Fig. 12, the tweedlike structure appears to consist of mutually perpendicular platelets which are ~100 nm long and ~5 nm wide in the _a_-_b_ plane. Associated with this structure are, as before, the diffuse streaks along both of the <110> directions at each of the diffracted spots as shown in the ED pattern of a specimen with x = 0.03 (Fig. 12). (While the diffuse streak is weak and not easily reproduced in prints, it is clearly illustrated in the inset in Fig. 12 for the <220> spot.) In order to further study the nature of these streaks, the diffraction patterns in two other zones (<100> and <110>) are illustrated in Fig. 13 (_a_ and b, respectively). In the enlarged <03_1> diffraction spots, as shown in the inset in Fig. 14, weak diffuse scattering extends toward the <0k0> directions and the width of the scattering along <001> directions is less than ~1 of the distance between the <00_1>_ and <00_1>_. The latter indicates that the individual small platelike region of the tweedlike structure extends approximately 10-20 nm along the c direction. This observation is contrary to the result of Bordet _et al._41 in which the streak extended significantly in the <001> direction, implying that the tweed structure is not coherent in the <001> direction. (This is also different from the oxygen-vacancy ordering in the CuO planes in oxygen-deficient YBa2Cu3O7-_x_, where the ordering is not coherent from one CuO plane to another along the c axis. In that case the streaks due to the ordered plane extend along the <001> direction.42) The diffraction pattern along the <110> zone [Fig. 14(b)] does not show diffuse scattering along the <hh0> directions and only weak scattering along the <001> directions. From this we conclude that one of the streaks at the <hh0>-type spots in the <001> zone diffraction pattern in Fig. 13 is likely to be due to double scattering (e.g., at the <hh0> spots the streak along the [110] direction is due to double scattering and the streak along the [\overline{1}10] is real and due to the plateletlike regions which are parallel to the [110] direction). Another important feature is that the length of the streak increases as the order of the diffraction spot increases in the reciprocal space away from the central beam. (Since the intensity of the diffused streaks are so weak, this effect is not observable in Fig. 13 but is easily seen in the negatives of the ED patterns.) The above re  sults indicate that these streaks are not simply due to the small size of the platelets but also to an additional source, such as a variation in \Delta a or strain at the boundary as will be discussed later.

#### iii.3.6 YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Fe_{x})_{3}O_{7-g}: x = 0.10-0.15

For Fe contents x = 0.10 and 0.15, there is no tweed structure in the image, at least at our magnification of 50-100 K but, some very fine microstructural features are visible. (See Fig. 15). However, the diffuse streaks, which were seen at lower compositions, are still observed (as shown in the inset of the figure), but they are significantly weaker than those in the specimens with 0.03 \leq x \leq 0.05. Furthermore, for x = 0.15, additional diffuse scattering is observed around the \langle hk\,0\rangle diffracted beams between the (00_l_) and (00l + 1) planes in the reciprocal space as shown in Fig. 16. This may be due to ordering of Fe or oxygen in the CuO planes. The details of this aspect of the work will be discussed elsewhere.[43]

## IV Discussion

### Electron microscopy

#### iv.1.1 The twin-boundary layers

Very sharp streaks at the low-order diffraction spots in the ED patterns are observed for x \leq 0.02. The lengths of these streaks decrease with increasing contents of Fe. As stated earlier, from the lengths, the thickness of the non-orthorhombic layers are estimated to be 1.0-1.5 nm at x = 0 and 1.6-2.4 nm at x = 0.02. (However it is possible that the reduction in length of the streaks may be partly due to roughening of the interface between the matrix and the layer which is associated with the formation of the early stage of the tweedlike structure.)

Although, we have observed the twin-boundary layers in a number of other specimens, (e.g., Zn- and Ni-substituted 1:2:3) by the electron diffraction technique,[40] the existence of such layers has not been widely discussed previously.[44, 45] This is surprising considering its significance in understanding the role of the twin boundaries in determining superconducting properties of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. Bary[45] reported possible observation of a "twin boundary phase " in _some_ of the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} specimens. Using high-resolution electron microscopy, he observed regions approximately 3 monolayers thick (\sim0.8 nm), which were not orthorhombic, at the twin boundary. On the other hand, Sarikaya and co-workers[44] suggested that the twin boundary is nonorthorhombic and has a thickness of 3-5 nm as measured by a converging beam electron-diffraction technique. Our estimate for the layer thickness for the pure YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is in accordance with that of Barry. Furthermore, we believe that the twin boundaries in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} or similar specimens always contain thin layers which are different from the orthorhombic matrix. However, when the twin-boundary spacing is large, it is difficult to observe these layers due to the limited area contributing to the intensity of the streaks. The structural difference between the layer and the matrix may be so slight that it is not easily observed in the high-resolution microscopy.

#### iv.1.2 Twin-boundary spacings

In order to discuss effects of the Fe substitution for Cu on the spacing between the twin boundaries, we will first consider the general factors which affect the spacing. According to an equation derived by Welch,[46] the twin-boundary spacing d depends on the grain size g, the orthorhombicity,

\[\phi \simeq (1 - [a/b]) \simeq \Delta a_{0} = 2(b - a)/(b + a)\ ,\]

the interface energy of the twin boundary g and the elastic shear modulus M as

\[d \simeq (g\gamma/cM\phi^{2})^{1/2}\ ,\]

where c is a constant of the order of the unity and g is measured _along the twin boundary in the_ \langle 110\rangle_direction_. Note that this expression is similar to that obtained by Arlt and Sasko[47] but their value of the constant c is 1/128\pi. Sarikaya and co-workers[44] have also derived a slightly different expression for d, which does not contain the grain size dependence. Recent experimental results[48, 49] have shown that dependence of d on the grain size is indeed \sim\sqrt{g}. Furthermore, a careful measurement of d and g along the \langle 110\rangle direction indicated that the constant c is approximately one rather than 1/128\pi.[50]

Although the size of the grains decreases with increasing Fe content, this decrease cannot alone explain the reduction in the twin spacing which was observed in this study. The grain size at x = 0.02 compared to that at x = 0 is reduced by about a factor of 4. This reduction in the grain size predicts only a factor of two smaller twin boundary spacings. This predicted variation is in fact much smaller than that observed. Thus, we will neglect this factor for the present discussion.

The orthorhombicity _ph_ (or \Delta a_{0}) (as measured by x-ray diffraction) diminishes with increasing Fe content x. Since d is inversely proportional to the orthorhombicity \Delta a_{0}, our expression predicts the spacing to increase with the increasing Fe content. However, the twin-boundary spacings actually decreases with the addition of Fe up to x = 0.02, as shown in Figs. 7-10. At x = 0.025, approximately one-half of the specimens contain relatively large twins, the other half fine twins. Finally, the twins disappear for x \cong 0.03. This variation in the spacing indicates that the substitution of Fe for Cu lowers the value of the twin-boundary surface energy g, favoring a larger number of the twins for x \leq 0.02 than for the pure 1:2:3. (This is also suggested by Shaw _et al._[48] based on the expression by Arlt and Sasko.[47]) At x = 0.025 the situation becomes less clear. However, it is reasonable to suggest that at this composition, the effects of decreasing values of g and (\Delta a_{0})^{2} are comparable in determining the values of d, and small local variation in the Fe and/or O content may cause the local differences in d which were observed (i.e., \sim 50% very fine and \sim 50% medium-size twins). Thus, the variations in the spacing d are basically due to the  lowering of the interfacial energy g by Fe additions. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to estimate the value of g in this system and at present it is not clear how such small substitutions of Fe can influence g so strongly, e.g., \gamma(x = 0)/\gamma(x = 0.02) = 10^2 since _d_(_x_ = 0) = 200 nm and _d_(_x_ = 0.02) = 20 nm. However, the above result is not unreasonable in light of the fact that replacement of Fe in the CuO chain has a strong effect on determining the location of O in the CuO planes and has increased the thickness of the twin-boundary layers and thus reduced the strain energy of the boundary in comparison to those for the pure oxide.

The variations in the twin-boundary spacing due to the substitution of Fe for Cu are qualitatively described by assuming a greater reduction in g with Fe than in (D_a_0)2 in Eq. (1). However, the tweed structure coexists with the twins for 0.015 <= x <= 0.025. As described below, the tweed structure is thought to consist of fine (<= 5 mm) orthorhombic domains related by the twinlike boundaries. (See Sec. IV.1.3). It is not clear why formation of these twinlike domains does not release the strain energy due to the transformation from the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase to avoid formation of the twins. It appears from the above result that the twins are primarily determined by the average D_a_0 (such as measured by x-ray-diffraction techniques) rather than the local D_a_ of the scale of < 5 nm in the domains.

#### iv.1.3 The "tweed" structure and the diffuse streaks

Formation of the tweed morphology is quite common in the 1:2:3 system where the substitution of other elements such as Ga28, Al29, and Co30 causes the crystallographic structural changes from the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase at sufficient levels of the substitution of Cu by each of these elements (e.g., x - 0.03). A similar tweed structure, somewhat coarser than the present one and an associated diffuse scattering, can also be observed in oxygen deficient YBa2Cu3O7 - d.30,51,52 There have been some attempts to interpret the diffuse scattering and the tweedlike morphology in these systems.30,40,53,54

The first observation of the diffuse streaks and the tweedlike structure was reported by Iijima _et al._52 in YBa2Cu3O7 - d by heating the specimens in an electron microscope. The size of the tweedlike structure was significantly greater than those observed in the present study of alloy YBa2Cu3O7. Independently, a similar observation was also made by van Tendeloo and Amelinckx55 by the same technique. The latter attributed the streaks to very fine twins without specifying the size while Iijima _et al._52 suggested that these are from the small twin_like_ structure (~16 nm). In a later article, Ichihashi _et al._30 proposed that this structure is formed by having small elongated islands of the tetragonal phase in the orthorhombic phase. The islands are separated from the orthorhombic matrix by thin transition layers. More recently, based on high-resolution electron microscopy, Roth _et al._54 and Sastry, Wordenweber, and Freyhardt56 suggested without detailed explanations that the diffuse streaks in YBa2(Cu0.95Fe0.05)3O7 - d are due to very small 2-5 nm orthorhombic domains. [Although Sastry _et al._ claimed that they have measured a = 0.383 and b = 0.39 nm for a Fe-substituted specimen from a high-resolution electron micrograph, this is unlikely. In order to measure D_a_ of ~1%, it is required to measure distances for 50-100 lattice planes in the two directions, i.e., a and b. Since the domain is ~5 nm, each domain can contain only 10-15 (= 5/0.38) lattice planes in the a or b direction. Thus, it makes it nearly impossible to measure a and b to the accuracy of 1%.]

On the other hand, Bordet _et al._41 proposed that the streaks are due to closely spaced linear clusters of Fe cation chains extending along the (110) directions and separating the orthorhombic domains. In addition, a study of YBa2(Cu1 - x Fex_)3O7 - d by high-resolution electron microscopy led Hiroi _et al._53 to conclude that the streaks and the tweedlike structures for x = 0.04 are due to microdomains of the orthorhombic phase. They furthermore suggested that the domains are squares and each corner of the square domain is occupied by Fe atoms. However, it seems likely that the position of the Fe atoms in the lattice determined at temperatures well above the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase transformation (> 700 degC). Thus, it is difficult to imagine any interaction forces capable of ordering a small number of Fe atoms in the ways described. Although the above suggestions (the microdomains of the orthorhombic phase and the fine embryos of the tetragonal phase in the orthorhombic phase), appears to be appropriate in describing the tweedlike structure and the associated diffuse streaks in some cases, we find neither one of them is sufficient or detailed enough to satisfactorily explain the evolution of the microstructures and the ED patterns in the YBa2(Cu1 - x Fex_)3O7 - d with 0.05 <= x <= 0.15.

In order to discuss possible microstructural origins of the tweedlike structure and the streaks in the ED patterns of YBa2(Cu1 - x Fex_)3O7 - d specimens, it is important to note the following: Common to the electron diffraction observations for 0.03 <= x <= 0.15 are narrow streaks of diffuse scattering along the 11101 (and the [110]) direction through most of the reflections, thus forming a cross. Exceptions are the [_hh1_] (and the [_hh1_]) reflections where there is a diffuse streak in only one direction, namely, the [110] and [110] direction, respectively. Another exception occurs at the (00_l_) reflections where there appear to be no diffuse streaks. The above is also true for the diffuse streak portion of the ED patterns for x = 0.015-0.025 but is not as clear as in the cases for x <= 0.03.

A distribution of diffuse scattering similar to that described above is expected for twin related domains when the (110) and the equivalent (110) planes are the twin planes for a continuous range of _b_/_a_ ratios ranging from 1.0 to _b_/_a_ = 3.88/3.82 = 1.016 (i.e., the _b_/_a_ ratio of YBa2Cu3O7) within the illuminated area. This would apply even if the domains were large, provided the electron beam had a sufficient diameter to probe statistically all _b_/_a_ ratios. In that case, the majority would be tetragonal.

Very thin coherent domains which are twin related will also give similar streaks of diffuse scattering due to their limited thickness (shape effect) even for the unlikely situation that a = b [if, e.g., the chains of oxygen atoms are rotated 90deg across the (110) twin boundary].

  An observable difference between these two extreme cases is that for larger microtwins with _b/a_=1 the length of the diffuse streaks will increase with increasing distance from the (001) axis in reciprocal space observed for 0.015\leq x\leq 0.05. For the other extreme where _a = b_, the length of the streaks would be the same for all reflections (as seen for x = 0.10 and 0.15). Due to multiple scattering, which tends to redistribute the diffuse scattering among the reflections, it can be difficult to distinguish between these two cases. There is, however, evidence that at lower Fe content (_x_ <= 0.05) _b/a_ > 1, whereas for x = 0.10 and x = 0.15 the shape effect dominates and masks any possible effect of _b/a_ > 1. Also, it is expected that the first case would result in a stronger contrast than the second in the images as shown in Figs. 12 and 15, respectively. Furthermore, the first description is very similar to that proposed by Ichihashi _et al._[30] if one interprets their transition layers and tetragonal islands as the regions where a_{a} semiperiodically varies along the [110] directions. In this composition region, the contrast in the image and the streaks is also possibly due to the strain along the [110] direction. [57]

From these observations one cannot deduce the exact structure of the domains. As suggested by others, the observations do strongly suggest that we are dealing with microtwins in the (110) planes, possibly with a _b/a_ ratio less than for pure YBa2Cu3O7 but larger than 1. The thickness of the microtwins decreases from ~4.0 to ~1.5 nm when the Fe content increases from 3% to 15%. For x = 0.15 we also observe a tendency towards periodic twins with a period of 3.87 x 6/2 = 1.63 nm. This observation will be discussed in more detail elsewhere. [43]

### Superconducting properties

The possibility of enhanced values of T_{c} at the twin boundary has been suggested in Refs. [6] and [7]. Increased values of T_{c} in YBa2Cu3O7 near grain boundaries is predicted to become observable when the twin-boundary spacing is on the order of ~20 nm or smaller. However, in spite of the fact that the spacing is reduced to 10-20 nm for specimens with Fe x = 0.02, T_{c} continues to decrease smoothly with increasing Fe content. This suggests that the existence of such high-_T__c_ regions at the twin boundary is unlikely, although it can be argued that the addition of Fe has changed the nature of the boundary such that the condition leading to higher T_{c} at the boundary is destroyed. In fact, the boundary layer is non-orthorhombic and is expected to have a reduced superconductivity as suggested by Deutscher and Muller. [9]

In trying to determine various aspects of crystallographic and/or structural properties which may be important for achieving high critical temperatures in these oxides, the possible importance of the bond length [Cu(1) - O(1)] between the Cu in the chain and the oxygen just above (sometimes called "sticks") was pointed out based on studies of oxygen-deficient. [58] Co-doped YBa2Cu3O7 - x. [59] However, if the lattice parameter c along the (001) directions is taken as an indication of the change in the length of the "stick," the variation in the length, which is associated with the Fe substitutions, is negligible since the value of c decreased only by ~0.14% from x = 0 to 0.15. [In pure YBa2Cu3O7 - s, the increase (~1.3%) in c is accompanied by a decrease (~1.67%) in the "stick" length for the variation in oxygen of d = 0 to d = 0.8. Thus, the above assumption in regard to the relationship between the changes in c and the "stick" length is likely to be appropriate.] Thus, in contrast to the Co substituted YBa2Cu3O7, [59] the value of T_{c} in this system diminished to zero at x = 0.15 in spite of the very small change in the apparent "stick" length.

While there are a limited number of direct measurements of the [Cu(1) - O(1)] bond length by neutron and x-ray diffraction for x <= 0.167 (Refs. [24], [41], and [54]) in the YBa2(Cu1 - x Fe x )3O7 - d system, the values reported by these studies are not consistent enough to draw a definite conclusion on the relationship between the bond length and the values of T_{c}. For example, our neutron-diffraction data show that the lengths of 0.1853, 0.1840, and 0.1849 nm for x = 0, x = 0.10, and 0.167, respectively. (The length for x = 0.167 was adjusted for the room-temperature value using the data of Roth _et al._[54] at 3 and 300 K for x = 0.05.) Roth _et al._[54] reports that the length is 0.1829 and 0.1855 nm for x = 0.05 measured by neutron and x-ray diffraction, respectively, while Bordet _et al._[41] measured the length to be 0.1838 nm for x = 0.07 by neutron diffraction. Furthermore, Roth _et al._[54] believe that their single-crystal x-ray-diffraction result is more precise than their neutron data on the length. Also, Tao _et al._[24] report the length of the Cu(1) - O(1) bond to be 0.1791 nm in their YBa2Cu2,5Fe0.5O7 - d (this is equivalent to x = 0.167). However, the value of the "_c_" parameter for this specimen is 1.1637 nm which is substantially greater than our values for c for the same composition. It is likely that the amount of oxygen in their specimen is less than the maximum which the composition can absorb. Thus, in the Fe-substituted YBa2Cu3O7 - d, a clear dependence of T_{c} on the "stick" length could not be established from the neutron- and x-ray-diffraction data in contrast to the result which was reported by Miceli _et al._[59] on the Co-substituted YBa2Cu3O7 - d. This could be due to the fact that such a relationship does not apply at least for the Fe-substituted system and/or the precision in the determinations of the length is not high enough, particularly when it is measured on different specimens by different groups of researchers.

A measurement of the carrier concentration n as determined by the Hall coefficient [60] indicates a smooth decrease of n as the Fe concentration is increased, in the same manner as for oxygen deficient YBa2Cu3O7 - d. This result supports the importance of large n for achieving high-_T__c_ values [61] and suggests that the increasing values of resistivity with x of YBa2(Cu1 - x Fe x )3O7 - d are associated with reduced carrier density. Furthermore, measurements of electronic specific-heat coefficient for the similar Fe-substituted specimens [62] show decreasing strength of specific-heat jumps at T_{c} with increasing Fe. This may also be due to the decrease of n. However, it is not clear how the Fe atoms in the CuO plane influence the CuO2 plane without significant changes in the length of the "stick," since the CuO2 plane is generally accepted as the  region of the crystal where the essential part of superconductivity is taking place in these high-T_{c} layered oxides.

The most interesting aspects of the influence of microstructural variations due to the Fe substitution are its effect on intragrain critical current densities and critical magnetic fields. Due to the fact that the only obvious defects in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} are the twin boundaries and that critical current densities of single-crystal or oriented films and bulk single crystals are very high in the _a-b_ plane, the twin boundaries are thought to be strong pinning sites.[6, 63, 64] If this is the case, the value of J_{c} for a specimen with x = 0.02 Fe should be significantly higher than that for the pure YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. Furthermore, the fine tweedlike structure observed for the specimens with 0.03\leq x\leq 0.05 may also be expected to act as effective pinning sites for the flux lines. However, disappointingly and as also found by other,[65, 66] preliminary measurements of magnetization on _c_-oriented powders of these specimens indicate that the intragrain J_{c} decreases with increasing Fe in spite of microstructural changes which appear to be favorable for flux pinning.[67] The details of this result as well as the effects of other elemental substitutions such as Ni, Cr, Zn, Al, and Ga on the intragrain current densities will be discussed elsewhere. However, some preliminary suggestions can be made. (1) Either the twin-boundary planes are not effective pinning sites, or the substitution of Fe for Cu in the CuO plane modifies the structure of the twin-boundary region (e.g., widen the boundary thickness) such that the pinning strength of the boundary is reduced. (The spatial modulation of the electronic properties, which is pertinent for pinning, becomes too gradual for flux pinning in the tweedlike structure.) (2) The reduction in the carrier density may also influence the values of the intragrain critical current densities in the Fe-substituted 1:2:3 oxides. Finally, (3) as described by Wodenweber _et al._,[65] the reduction in the H_{C2} with the Fe substitution reduces the value of J_{c}.

  Figure 10: Dark-field transmission electron micrographs of YBa_{2}(Cu_{0.98}Fe_{0.02})_{3}O_{7-\delta} showing very finely divided twins from two different areas using g=(200) to image the twins in both directions. The insets show appearance of very weak diffuse scattering streaks along the \langle hh0\rangle and \langle\overline{h}h0\rangle directions.

  Figure 11: A dark-field transmission electron micrograph of Y Ba_{2}(Cu_{0.975}Fe_{0.025})_{3}O_{7}-_{8} showing the twins and the tweed structure which are superimposed. The diffraction condition was \langle 200\rangle to show the tweed in both of the \langle hh0\rangle directions. The inset shows the reduced separation of the (220) split and the increased intensity on the diffuse scattering streak.

  Figure 12: A dark-field transmission electron micrograph of YBa_{2}(Cu_{0.97}Fe_{0.03})_{3}O_{7-\delta} showing the tweedlike structure using g=(200). Note that the \langle 220\rangle reflection is not split and the diffuse scattering is stronger than that for x\equiv 0.025.

  Figure 13: A \langle 001\rangle zone selected area electron-diffraction pattern form the area in Fig. 12 showing the crossed diffuse scattering at all \langle hk0\rangle diffraction.

  Figure 14: Selected area electron-diffraction patterns from (a) the (100) and (b) the \langle 110\rangle zones of YBa_{2}(Cu_{0.97}Fe_{0.03})_{3}O_{7}-\delta. The insets show (a) the presence of and (b) the absence of the diffuse scattering in the \langle 100\rangle and the \langle 110\rangle zones, respectively.

  Figure 15: A dark-field transmission electron micrograph from YBa_{2}(Cu_{0.90}Fe_{0.10})_{3}O_{7}-_{\delta}. At this composition, the tweedlike structure is not clearly visible but weak diffuse streaks exist (see inset ) g=(200).

  Figure 16: A selected area diffraction from YBa_{2}(Cu_{0.85}-Fe_{0.15})_{\mathchar 22\mskip-9.0mu h}O_{7-\delta} showing the appearance of diffuse scattering which is centered at a position along the \langle hh0\rangle direction and at 0,167(\sqrt{2}/a). The electron-diffraction pattern is taken by tilting \sim 15^{\circ} away from the \langle 001\rangle zone along the [hh0] direction.

  Figure 7: A dark-field transmission electron micrograph of a YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} taken with g =(110) showing very large twins. The inset indicates the degree of the split at the (220) reflection due to the twin formation. In this case g is parallel to the twin boundary and the direction of the split is perpendicular to the boundary and g.

  Figure 8: A selected area electron-diffraction pattern from the area shown in Fig. 6. Note that the twin boundary is parallel to the [hh0] direction and the split at the diffraction spots is zero at the [\bar{h}h0] and maximum at the [hh0].

  Figure 9: A dark-field transmission electron micrograph of YBa_{2}(Cu_{0.985}Fe_{0.015})_{3}O_{7}-_{8} taken with g=(110). Note that the size of the twins and the separation of the (220) spots are significantly reduced.
