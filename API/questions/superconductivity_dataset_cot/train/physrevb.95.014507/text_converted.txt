###### Abstract

Extreme magnetoresistance (XMR) in topological semimetals is a recent
discovery which attracts attention due to its robust appearance in a
growing number of materials. To search for a relation between XMR and
superconductivity, we study the effect of pressure on LaBi. By
increasing pressure, we observe the disappearance of XMR followed by the
appearance of superconductivity at P ≈ 3.5 GPa. We find a region of
coexistence between superconductivity and XMR in LaBi in contrast to
other superconducting XMR materials. The suppression of XMR is
correlated with increasing zero-field resistance instead of decreasing
in-field resistance. At higher pressures, P ≈ 11 GPa, we find a
structural transition from the face-centered cubic lattice to a
primitive tetragonal lattice, in agreement with theoretical predictions.
The relationship between extreme magnetoresistance, superconductivity,
and structural transition in LaBi is discussed.

## I Introduction

Extreme magnetoresistance (XMR) is an enormous increase of electrical
resistance in response to a modest magnetic field observed in several
topological semimetals including Cd₃As₂, Na₃Bi, NbAs, NbP, TaAs, NbSb₂,
TaSb₂, WTe₂, (Zr/Hf)Te₈[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Recent studies
on (W/Mo)Te₂ and (Zr/Hf)Te₅ suggest that pressure suppresses the extreme
magnetoresistance (XMR) and gives rise to superconductivity [11, 12, 13,
14]. Several of these materials show a rapid onset of superconductivity
at the pressure where XMR is suppressed, followed by a slow suppression
of T_(c) with further increasing pressure. For example, MoTe₂ is
superconducting at zero pressure with T_(c) = 0.1 K which rapidly
increases to 8 K by applying only 1 GPa of pressure [15]. WTe₂ is not
superconducting at P = 0, it shows an incomplete superconducting
transition at P = 2.5 GPa and a full transition at P = 8 GPa [11, 12].
Similarly, ZrTe₅ is not superconducting at P = 0, it shows a sudden
onset of superconductivity at P = 6.7 GPa with a subsequent T_(c)
discontinuity at P = 20 GPa attributed to a second superconducting state
[13]. By pressurizing LaBi we searched for the above-mentioned
characteristics including XMR suppression, superconducting transition,
and discontinuous T_(c) evolution.

The recent interest in LaBi is due to the observation of XMR in this
material despite its simple electronic and crystalline structure [16,
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. The three panels of Fig. 1 summarize our main
findings:

(a) The suppression of XMR by pressure is a purely electronic effect
with no drastic changes in the structural parameters below 5 GPa.

(b) Pressure induces a structural transition at 11 GPa in LaBi.

(c) Superconductivity appears under pressure in LaBi, similar to WTe₂
and ZrTe₅.

## II Methods

Single crystals of LaBi were grown using indium flux and characterized
by using powder x-ray diffraction and energy dispersive x-ray
spectroscopy as explained in previous works [17, 23]. Low-pressure
measurements (P < 2.5 GPa) were performed in a piston-cylinder clamp
cell using 40 : 60 mixture of light mineral oil : n-pentane as a
hydrostatic medium. Pressure was measured from the superconducting
transition of a Pb gauge placed beside the sample in the clamp cell
[24]. The pressure cell was fit to a Quantum Design physical property
measurement system (PPMS) which monitored simultaneously the resistance
of the sample, the Pb gauge, and a calibrated Cernox sensor attached to
the body of the cell for accurate thermometry. High-pressure
measurements were performed in a designer diamond anvil cell using
steatite as the pressure-transmitting medium and MP35N as the gasket
material [25]. The designer diamond had eight tungsten microcontacts
centered on a 300 μm cutlet for electrical transport measurements.
Pressure was measured by fluorescent spectroscopy on two pieces of ruby
placed beside the sample in the diamond anvil cell [26]. Changes of
pressure between room temperature and 10 K are less than 5

Magnetic measurements of the superconducting transition in LaBi were
performed by using a nonmagnetic diamond anvil cell (DAC) inside a
commercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)
magnetometer. The magnetic background from the cell was accounted for
and subtracted carefully, as described in Appendix C. High-pressure
x-ray diffraction was performed in a membrane-driven DAC with 300 μm
culet diamond anvils and a rhenium gasket with a 120 μm hole filled with
LaBi powder, copper powder as the pressure marker, and neon as the
hydrostatic medium. Diffraction experiments took place at the Advanced
Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory (beam lines 16 ID-B and 13
ID-D) with 29.2 and 37.1 keV monochromatic x-ray beams. Angle dispersive
diffraction patterns were collected with an area detector (Pilatus1M or
Mar345) with exposure times ranging from 20 to 120 seconds.
Two-dimensional x-ray diffraction images were integrated using fit2d[27]
software and refined using the expgui/gas[28] software to extract
structural parameters. Band-structure calculations are performed with
the wien2k program using the general gradient approximation on augmented
plane waves and local orbitals[29].

## III Results

Figure 1 summarizes our main findings and provides a guide for the rest
of the article. Figure 1(a) shows the suppression of magnetoresistance
MR = 100$\frac{R(T)-R(0)}{R(0)}$ by pressure. At high pressures, MR
reduces to less than a few percent. Figure 1(b) shows smooth compression
of the cubic unit cell with no structural anomaly as the extreme
magnetoresistance (XMR) is suppressed by pressure. Therefore, the
suppression of XMR is due to smooth changes in the electronic structure
of LaBi. At P≈ 11 GPa a discontinuity occurs in the unit-cell volume due
to a structural transition. Figure 1(c) shows that superconductivity
(R = 0) starts at P≈ 3.5 GPa where XMR is substantially but not
completely suppressed.

The magenta open circles in Fig. 1(c) are T_(c) values from magnetic
susceptibility measurements, proving bulk superconductivity in LaBi. The
susceptibility data are shown in Appendix C. In the rest of the paper,
we discuss the effect of pressure on magnetoresistance, crystal
structure, and superconductivity in LaBi.

### The effect of pressure on extreme magnetoresistance

This section presents our data at lower pressures (P< 2.5 GPa), from
clamp cell experiments, to focus on the suppression of XMR with
pressure. Figures 2(a)-2(d) compare the normalized resistance R(T)/R(300
K), at H = 0 (blue) and H = 9 T (red), at P = 0, 0.3, 1.6, and 2.4 GPa.
The red curve in Fig. 2(a) shows the typical profile of XMR with
δR/δT > 0 at T > 70 K, δR/δT < 0 at 20 K < T < 70 K, and δR/δT → 0 at T < 20 K. All topological semimetals
with XMR show the same profile where R(T) decreases initially with
decreasing temperature, then increases, and finally saturates to a
plateau[17]. The blue curve at H = 0 shows metallic conduction where
R(T) decreases with decreasing temperature to a very small residual
value R(0). Such small R(0) is essential to having an extremely large
ratio R(H)/R(0), i.e., XMR.

Figures 2(a)-2(d) show a moderate increase of R(H = 9 T) in the
_plateau_ region (T < 20 K) from 0 to 0.3 GPa followed by a decrease at
1.6 GPa and a pronounced decrease at 2.4 GPa. These changes do not
account for the systematic suppression of XMR as a function of pressure
shown in Fig. 1(a). To understand the systematic decrease of XMR we turn
attention to the zero-field resistance R(H = 0). Figures 2(e)-2(h) zoom
into the normalized resistance at H = 0 and T < 30 K at P = 0, 0.3, 1.6,
and 2.4 GPa to reveal a systematic increase of the zero-field resistance
by increasing pressure. The black

T_(c) increases with increasing pressure until P= 6 GPa, then decreases
until P= 11 GPa where it shows a sudden increase concurrent with the
structural transition. The red circles show T_(c) values from
resistivity and the open magenta circles show the values from
magnetization.

lines are fits to the expression R = R₀ + AT⁴ at each pressure. There is
no physical meaning to the T⁴ function. It simply fits the best to the
plateau region of R(T) and estimates R₀ more accurately. The systematic
increase of the zero-field resistance in Figs. 2(e)-2(h) explains the
systematic decrease of XMR as a function of pressure in Fig. 1(a).

Figure 3(a) visualizes the suppression of XMR with pressure by plotting
$\text{MR} = 100\frac{\text{R}(H) - R(0)}{R(0)}$ at T = 2 K as a
function of field at P = 0, 0.3, 1.6, and 2.4 GPa. Figure 3(b) shows a
clear anticorrelation between increasing R(0) and decreasing
magnetoresistance. Both the left and the right y axes are in a
logarithmic scale to compare the two quantities on equal footing. In
contrast, Fig. 3(c) shows the absence of a clear correlation between
R(9 T) and XMR. Comparing Figs. 3(b) and 3(c) makes a compelling case
that the zero-field resistance controls the magnitude of XMR in
agreement with previous works that correlate the residual resistivity of
various LaBi, LaSb, or WTe₂ samples with the magnitude of XMR [9,17,18].
Pressure inhomogeneity, evidenced by broad incomplete superconducting
transitions below 2.5 GPa, could lead to additional scattering which
increases the residual resistivity and decreases XMR.

### The effect of pressure on the structure

Figure 4(a) shows that the unit-cell volume of LaBi smoothly decreases
with increasing pressure until P ≈ 11 GPa. There is no structural
anomaly at lower pressures where extreme magnetoresistance is
suppressed. At 11 GPa there is a discontinuous 10

$$P(V) = \frac{3B}{2}\left[\left(\frac{V_{0}}{V}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}- \left(\frac{V_{0}}{V}\right)^{\frac{5}{3}}\right]$$
(1)
$$\times\left\{1+\frac{3}{4}(B^{\prime} - 4)\left[\left(\frac{V_{0}}{V}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}-1\right]\right\},$$

where P₀ and V₀ are the coordinates of the first data points in the fcc
and the PT phases. The bulk modulus B and its pressure derivative
B^(′) = ∂B/∂P in the low-pressure and the high-pressure structures are
extracted by fitting Eq. (1) to our data (see Table 1). In the
low-pressure fcc structure, our experimental value for the bulk modulus
agrees with the theoretical calculations by Cui _et al._[32] and
Vaitheeswaran _et al._[30]. In the high-pressure PT structure, the two
theory groups disagree. Cui _et al._ predict comparable bulk moduli
between the low- and the high-pressure structures. Vaitheeswaran _et
al._ predict a twofold increase of the bulk modulus in the high-pressure
PT structure. Our data clearly agree with the latter (see Table 1).
Representative powder x-ray diffraction data under pressure with
Rietveld refinements are shown in Appendix A for both fcc and PT phases.

The structural transition at 11 GPa changes the band structure of LaBi
as shown in Figs. 4(b) and 4(c). Figure 4(b)

(red) as a function of temperature at (a) P = 0, (b) P = 0.3 GPa, (c)
P = 1.6 GPa, and (d) P = 2.4 GPa. The normalized resistance at H = 9 T
in the plateau region is not systematically suppressed by increasing
pressure and therefore does not explain the systematic suppression of
XMR with pressure. A zoom into the normalized resistance R/R(300 K) at
H = 0 is shown for T < 30 K at (e) P = 0, (f) P = 0.3 GPa, (g)
P = 1.6 GPa, and (h) P = 2.4 GPa. Solid black lines are power law fits
to extract residual resistances. Broad and incomplete superconducting
transitions appear at P = 1.6 and 2.4 GPa, most likely due to pressure
inhomogeneity.

shows the band structure of LaBi in the low-pressure fcc structure with
two hole pockets at the Brillouin-zone center Γ and one electron pocket
at X. The small circles represent lanthanum d states and the large
circles represent bismuth p states. The extremely small R(0) and the
large R(H) in LaBi have been attributed to the mixing between d and p
states on the electron pocket at X[16, 17]. The combination of orbital
mixing, small ellipsoidal pockets, and electron-hole compensation as
shown in Fig. 4(b) is common to all topological semimetals and is
possibly the source of XMR [17].

Figure 4(c) shows the electronic structure of LaBi in the high-pressure
PT phase with two notable changes compared with the low-pressure fcc
phase: (1) The hole pocket near M is clearly larger than the electron
pocket near X and therefore electron-hole compensation is weaker in the
PT phase. The lack of electron-hole compensation in the PT phase
explains the lack of magnetoresistance at high pressures. (2) There is a
band inversion at the R point with a gap due to the spin-orbit coupling.
Based on the Fu-Kane-Mele formula [36], this gap corresponds to a strong
topological insulator. However, the hole pocket that crosses E_(F) near
M prevents LaBi from being an insulator. The detailed evolution of the
band structure in LaBi under pressure is given in Appendix B.

### The effect of pressure on superconductivity

Figure 5(a) shows that the first complete superconducting transition
(R = 0) appears at P ≈ 3.5 GPa in LaBi. At this pressure, XMR is reduced
by three orders of magnitude but has not completely vanished, as shown
in Fig. 1(a). Such

pressure. (b) Normalized resistance at H = 0 and T = 2 K are extracted

pressure (red circles corresponding to the right y axis). Both y axes

correlation between the two quantities.

coexistence of superconductivity and XMR is absent in WTe₂ and ZrTe₅
where superconductivity appears only when XMR completely disappears [11,
12, 13].

The onset of superconductivity is accompanied by two other observations,
marked by the vertical black dashed line on Fig. 5. First, the
normalized low-temperature resistance (R_(10K)/R_(300K)) shows
considerable increase at the onset of superconductivity [also see Fig.
5(b)]. Second, the Hall coefficient R_(H) changes sign [Fig. 5(c)]. The
complete temperature profiles of resistivity and Hall data are presented
in Figs. 2 and 6. A change of sign in R_(H) concurrent with
superconductivity was recently reported in another XMR material
WTe₂[11]. In Appendix B we use the experimental lattice parameters of
LaBi to calculate the evolution of its band structure by increasing
pressure. Figure 10 in Appendix B shows that the electron pocket size
reduces with pressure in agreement with the change of sign in R_(H) from
negative to positive with increasing pressure, as shown in Figs. 5(c)
and 6(c). Reference [17] argues that the electron pocket plays a central
role in XMR which is consistent with our observation of simultaneous
suppression of XMR, sign change in R_(H), and the appearance of
superconductivity.

The vertical blue dotted line on Fig. 5 marks the onset of structural
transition at P = 11 GPa as discussed in Sec. III B. After the
structural transition, T_(c) shows a sudden increase [Fig. 5(a)],
R_(10K)/R_(300K) reverses direction from decreasing to increasing [Fig.
5(b)], and R_(H) drops to almost zero [Fig. 5(c)]. The complete R(T)
profiles are presented in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b). Such drastic changes in
transport properties follow the drastic change of band structure as a
result of the structural transition shown in Fig. 4.

Figure 5(a) shows both T_(c) (left y axis) and H_(c2) (right y axis) at
each pressure. Figure 7 shows how we extract H_(c2) of LaBi by using the
extended Ginzburg-Landau formalism [37, 38]

$$H_{c2}(T)=H_{c2}(0)\frac{1-(T/T_{c})^{2}}{1+(T/T_{c})^{2}},$$

Superconductivity onsets at P ≈ 3.5 GPa, then T_(c) shows enhancement at
the structural transition at P ≈ 11 GPa. The onset of superconductivity
is shown by a black dashed line and the onset of structural transition
is shown by a dotted blue line. (b) R_(10K)/R_(300K) plotted as a

where H_(c2)(0) is the upper critical field at T = 0. From Fig. 7, the
values of H_(c2) = 11.5 T at P = 5.6 GPa and H_(c2) = 6.1 T at P = 17.9
GPa.

Since LaBi is made of two superconducting elements, it is possible that
the observed superconducting transitions arise from either La or Bi
impurity phases. We compare the T_(c)-P phase diagrams of La and Bi,
with LaBi in Fig. 8. La impurities are unlikely to be the cause of
superconductivity, because La has T_(c) values 4 to 6 K above LaBi at
all pressures [39, 40]. La metal also superconducts at zero pressure,
which is not observed here. Bismuth has T_(c) values much closer to LaBi
especially above 11 GPa, and therefore, filamentary superconductivity
from Bi impurities could be responsible for the signature of
superconductivity seen at higher pressures (P > 11 GPa) [41]. At low
pressures (P < 11 GPa), however, the two jumps in the T_(c) of bismuth
at 3 and 8 GPa due to structural transitions are absent in our data
[42]. The T_(c) values of LaBi increase continuously from 3.5 to 8 GPa
while they decrease in the same pressure range in Bi (Fig. 8). We also
observe the superconducting transition in the magnetic susceptibility
channel (Appendix C) which is inconsistent with bismuth filamentary
superconductivity. The superconducting (SC) volume fraction is estimated
to be more than 50

(green) and Bi (blue). Data points for La come from Ref. [39], and [40].
Data points for Bi come from Ref. [41]. and [42]. Superconductivity in
La starts from P = 0 and shows a dome-like structure with T_(c) that is
4 to 6 K higher than LaBi at all pressures. Therefore, superconductivity
from La impurity is not likely. Superconductivity in Bi starts from
P = 2.5 GPa with T_(c) = 4 K and shows a profile close to that of LaBi.

semiconmetals with XMR have similar issues and more detailed experiments
are required to clarify the link between XMR and SC [11, 12, 13, 15].

Figure 5(a) shows that, before the structural transition at P = 11 GPa,
H_(c2) values are almost double the value of T_(c) at each pressure,
i.e., H_(c2)/T_(c) ≈ 2, but after the transition the H_(c2)/T_(c)
suddenly drops to near unity. Recent studies show a change of T_(c) with
structural transition in ZrTe₅[13]. It would be interesting to look for
a similar H_(c2)/T_(c) drop in ZrTe₅ and other XMR materials that
superconduct under pressure.

## IV Summary

In summary, we study the effect of pressure on extreme
magnetoresistance, crystal structure, and superconducting properties of
LaBi. Pressure suppresses XMR and gives rise to superconductivity in
LaBi (Fig. 1). The suppression of XMR anticorrelates with the increase
of the residual resistance R(0) as shown in Fig. 3(b). It does not
correlate with the in-field resistance R(QT) as shown in Fig. 3(c). The
suppression of XMR is accompanied by a sign change in the Hall
coefficient R_(H) from negative to positive as shown in Figs. 5(c) and
6(c). Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations in Fig. 10 in
Appendix B confirm that the R_(H) sign change is due to the shrinking of
the electron pocket with increasing pressure. The change in the crystal
structure changes the band structure and creates a region of band
inversion in LaBi (Fig. 4). The changes in the band structure of LaBi
due to this structural transition give rise to a reversal in
R₁₀₈/R_(300K) from decreasing to increasing and a drop in R_(H) as shown
in Figs. 5(b) and 5(c). At the structural transition, there is a
discontinuity in T_(c) and in the ratio H_(c2)/T_(c) (Fig. 5).

## Appendix A Rietveld refinement of high-pressure X-ray diffraction
data

Figure 9 includes two representative structural refinements of the x-ray
diffraction data at P = 7 GPa and P = 21 GPa. The low-pressure structure
is rock salt (_B_1) and the high-pressure structure has a primitive
tetragonal unit cell as illustrated in Fig. 4. In Fig. 9(a), the peaks
between 8 and 9 degrees have been excluded from the refinement, and they
are likely to come from small inclusions of elemental Bi. At 7 GPa, Bi
is in a complex host-guest structure, which is difficult to refine with
so few evident peaks. For P > 8 GPa, elemental Bi is bcc, and we do
include this phase in the refinement; the most prominent Bi peak occurs
near 9 degrees in Fig. 9(b).

## Appendix B Evolution of the band structure with pressure

A recent challenge in condensed-matter physics is to understand the
small residual resistance of topological semimetals [43]. In this work,
we use pressure to tune the residual resistance of LaBi and study
changes to the band structure of the material through DFT calculations.
Figures 10(a)-10(c) present the band structure of LaBi in the fcc
structure at P = 0, 3.0, and 8.8 GPa before the structural transition.
Larger circles represent Bi p states and smaller circles represent La d
states. The calculation is based on our experimental values for the
lattice parameters of LaBi (see Fig. 4). With increasing pressure, the
Fermi energy E_(F) increases which changes both the size and the shape
of the electron pocket at X. At high pressures, a large portion of these
pockets is teared away, and their shape changes from a cigar shape to a
rounded shape. As a result, the quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D)
structure of these pockets is replaced by a three-dimensional (3D)
rounded structure. Figures 10(d)-10(f) present the band structure in the
PT structure after the structural transition at P = 16.6 and 32.9 GPa.
Figure 10(d) shows the results of DFT calculations in the PT structure
before including spin-orbit coupling (SOC). As a result of SOC, the two
bands that cross at R will hybridize to form a band-inverted gap as
shown in Fig. 10(e). Increasing pressure in the PT phase does not change
the band structure visibly as shown in Fig. 10(f) which is due to the
stiffer structure in the PT phase (Table 1). The band structure plotted
in Fig. 10(a) gives rise to the extreme magnetoresistance and a negative
R_(H) in LaBi; in Fig. 10(b) XMR is reduced, R_(H) has changed sign to
positive, and the material is on the verge of becoming a superconductor;
in Fig. 10(c) XMR is completely gone and the material is superconducting
in the fcc structure with _H__c_2/_T__c_ 2; in Fig. 10(e) the material
has gone through the structural phase transition, it continues to
superconduct in the PT structure but with _H__c_2/_T__c_ 1; in Fig.
10(f) LaBi is still superconducting in the PT phase with R_(H) becoming
nearly zero.

## Appendix C Magnetic susceptibility data

Measurements of the superconducting transition in LaBi were performed in
a nonmagnetic Almax easyLab Mcell Ultra that fits into the Quantum
Design Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS). Figure 11 shows
superconducting transitions at four different pressures in LaBi from
magnetization measurements at H = 25 Oe. T_(c) values are extracted from
the peak in _d_kh/_dT_ and plotted in Fig. 1(c) as empty magenta
circles. The choice of this criterion is based on several test runs with
the standard Pb sample. Error bars come from the full width at half
maximum (FWHM). The LaBi sample was prepared by grinding a single
crystal with a mortar and pestle into a fine powder. The powdered sample
was then loaded into the sample chamber along with small ( 15 μm
diameter) ruby spheres as a room-temperature pressure marker. No
pressure-transmitting medium was used. Pressure was calibrated at room
temperature by using the shift in the R1 ruby fluorescence peak with a 5

pressure. Full circles show data points and solid lines show _d_kh/_dT_.
T_(c) is defined as the peak in the derivative curves. The error in
T_(c) is estimated from the FWHM in the peak. Magnetization was measured
at H = 25 Oe.

procedure of first sweeping the field to 100 Oe, then returning back to
0 Oe at 20 K before beginning zero-field cooling to 2K for our M(T)
measurements. This procedure gave the lowest residual and the most
reproducible backgrounds. Once a good empty-cell background was acquired
at each applied field, the sample was loaded into the pressure cell and
the background subtraction algorithm in the MPMS was used in each of the
M(T) sweeps to search for T_(c) in LaBi. The superconducting transition
of LaBi was taken as the peak in dχ/dT vs T.
