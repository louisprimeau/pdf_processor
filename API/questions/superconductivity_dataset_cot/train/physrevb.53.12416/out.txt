###### Abstract

By intercalating large HgI_{2} molecules between the Bi_{2}O_{2} layers in Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{y} , the distance between the CuO_{2} blocks was significantly extended up to 7.2 A. The superconducting properties of this system were measured in various magnetic fields applied perpendicular to the CuO_{2} planes. This system showed large positional fluctuation of the vortex even far below the transition temperature due to the reduction of dimensionality. The change of the thermodynamic parameters is well explained by the model of Josephson-coupled superconductivity. However, the interlayer coupling strength did not change the transition temperature drastically, which does not support the suggestion of Wheatley, Hsu, and Anderson of coherent hopping of the valence bond pair between the CuO_{2} layers.

## I Introduction

Although it is well known that the superconductivity of cuprates is very much related to CuO_{2} planes, details of the interlayer coupling effect are not well understood. Since the out-of-plane coherence length \xi_{c} at T=0 K is smaller than the interlayer spacing, there is a dimensional crossover phenomena, where \xi_{c} is comparable to the interlayer distance.[1] The crossover temperature could depend on the interlayer coupling strength. Thus, if this coupling strength can be controlled, it will be very informative in understanding the relationship between interlayer coupling and superconductivity.

Recently, it was reported that a large molecule of HgX_{2} (_X_ =Br, I) could be intercalated between double Bi_{2}O_{2} layers of high-T_{c} Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{y} (Bi2212) superconductors.[2] According to magnetic susceptibility and powder x-ray diffraction measurements, it was found that the HgX_{2} intercalation dropped T_{c} only by a small fraction even with the remarkable lattice expansion along the c axis (\Delta \approx 7.2 A). Such results are different from those of iodine intercalation,[3, 4] with relatively larger T_{c} depressions and smaller lattice expansions. Therefore, since we can extend the distance between the CuO_{2} blocks by the HgX_{2} intercalation, this system would be an excellent example of obtaining the relationship between interblock coupling and superconductivity.

For the case of iodine intercalation, many efforts have been made to explain the effect of intercalation on superconductivity.[3, 4, 5, 6, 7] Actually, superconductivity can be affected by the interlayer Josephson coupling due to the change of the interlayer distance of the CuO_{2} layer and/or the modification of the electronic structure of the CuO_{2} layer. However, instead of Josephson coupling, Wheatley, Hsu, and Anderson[8] (WHA) accepted the coherent hopping of valence bond pairs between CuO_{2} planes. The phase coherence between valence bonds is achieved by pairing the holons. But the applicability of this model to the intercalation compounds has not yet been confirmed because an argument on two possible effects of intercalation, hole doping and the weakening of interblock coupling on the T_{c} depression, has remained unresolved for the case of iodine intercalation.[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

In this paper, we have prepared grain-aligned (HgI_{2})_{0.9}Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{y} (HgI_{2}-Bi2212) and measured its magnetization in various magnetic fields applied along the c axis, and compared it with that of pristine Bi2212. Since HgI_{2} intercalation results in a remarkable lattice expansion, it is expected that the dimensionality of the system could be reduced and the thermodynamic parameters, such as the penetration depth and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, will be significantly modified.

As expected, a reduction of the interlayer coupling strength and vastly enhanced positional fluctuation of the vortex were observed in the magnetization. The measured thermodynamic parameters are well explained by the change of the distance between superconducting CuO_{2} layers,[9, 10] but the change of T_{c} is too small to support the coherent hopping of the valance bond pair suggested by Wheatley, Hsu, and Anderson.[8]

## II Experiment

An HgI_{2}-Bi2212 compound was prepared by vapor transport reaction between the HgI_{2} molecule and the pristine Bi2212. The polycrystalline Bi2212 pellet and mercuric iodine (mole ratio of 1:5), together with free iodine [_P_(1**2**) \approx 1.5 atm] as a transporting agent, were heated in an evacuated Pyrex tube. Details of the sample preparation were given in the previous report.[2] Formation of the HgI_{2} intercalate and its stoichiometry were confirmed by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) using the DuPont 2000 Thermal Analysis Station and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), respectively.

To clarify the intrinsic anisotropic thermodynamic param  eters, Bi2212 and HgI_{2}-Bi2212 were ground down to less than 20 \mum, and were aligned simultaneously inside of the epoxy in a magnetic field of 7 T for 9 h. The resulting samples were examined by x-ray diffraction in Fig. 1. The (00_l_) peaks predominant in the XRD data confirm that the grains are oriented with the c axis along the applied field.

The shielding [zero-field-cooled (ZFC)] and Meissner [field-cooled (FC)] magnetization at 10 G for these samples is shown in Fig. 2. The shielding values at 10 K were 67% for Bi2212 and 61% for HgI_{2}-Bi2212 without a demagnetization correction. The onsets of the superconducting transition for Bi2212 and HgI_{2}-Bi2212 were 85 K and 82 K, respectively. Both of these samples exhibited a very small step near 110 K due to the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} phase with a volume fraction far less than 1%.

The magnetic measurements were performed in a Quantum Designs superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer for fields applied parallel to the c axis. Both background signals that originated from the epoxy and the holder were carefully subtracted.

## III Result and Discussion

According to XRD analysis, the c axis cell parameter of HgI_{2}-Bi2212 is 44.9 A, which corresponds to an increase of 14.3 A compared to that of pristine Bi2212. Since there are two intercalated layers of HgI_{2} for each unit cell of Bi2212, the extent of lattice expansion per each intercalate layer corresponds to 7.2 A, which is almost twice that of the basal increment of iodine intercalation (\Delta d = 3.6 A). Although mercuric iodide intercalation remarkably expands the c axis in Bi2212, it has little effect on the in-plane a and b parameters.

The XRD, after the grain alignment, experiment confirmed that the polycrystalline intercalate was well developed along the (00_l_) planes (Fig. 1). Based on the observed (00_l_) XRD patterns, a one-dimensional Fourier map from the structure factors F_{(00l)} was calculated. As can be seen in Fig.

Figure 3: Schematic structural model for grain-aligned HgI_{2}-intercalated Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{y} along with the one-dimensional Fourier map, which is based on the best fit to the observed XRD patterns.

  3, the one-dimensional Fourier map clearly shows that the mercuric iodide molecule is intercalated in between the Bi2O2 double layer and the HgI2 molecular axis is tilted with an angle of 48^{\circ} with respect to the c axis. Based upon the electron density map, the schematic structure is represented (Fig. 3).

Figure 4 demonstrates the TGA curve of the HgI2 intercalated sample for the temperature range between 20 and 800 ^{\circ}C. The total weight loss at 800 ^{\circ}C is 21.2%, which is in agreement with the calculated value of total loss of (HgI2)03Bi2Sr2CaCu2Oy (20.8%). EPMA also confirms the portion of HgI2 in the sample. The average atomic ratio between Hg, I, and Bi was estimated to be 0.5:1:2, as summarized in Table 1.

This chemically well-defined sample is used for the comparative study on the magnetization of Bi2212 and HgI2-Bi2212. For the detailed analysis, the vortex fluctuation model of Bulaevskii, Ledvij, and Kogan [11] (BLK) and the Hao-Clem model [12, 13] have been used. In the vortex fluctuation model, positional fluctuation of vortices, i.e., thermal distortion of two-dimensional pancake vortices out of the straight stacks near _T_c , is considered. In the model of Hao and Clem, the free energy of the normal cores is also included but the effect of positional fluctuations is not. Thus, this model is valid at a temperature somewhat lower than _T_c , where the vortex fluctuation is not dominant. Both theories are valid at the limited range of temperature. A proper temperature range was chosen for the analysis.

BLK (Ref. [11]) calculated the free energy of a mixed state in the frame of the Lawrence-Doniach model using a harmonic approximation. For the anisotropic ratio g\gg1 (\gamma^{2}\!=\!m_{c}/m_{ab} is the superpair effective mass ratio), for the applied magnetic field H parallel to c axis, and B_{\alpha}\!\approx\!\phi_{0}/s^{2}\gamma^{2}\!\ll\!\!H\!\ll\!\!H_{c2}, they obtained the magnetization from the free energy, which includes the extra contribution of entropy due to thermally distorted pancakes,

\[-M(T,H)\!=\!\frac{\phi_{0}}{32\pi^{2}\lambda_{ab}^{2}}\!\!\!\!\  from the positional fluctuation of vortices. From Eq. (1) the slope \partial M/\partial lnH is easily calculated,

\[\frac{\partial M}{\partial\,\ln\!H} = \frac{\phi_{0}}{32\pi^{2}\lambda_{ab}^{2}(T)}-\frac{k_{B}T}{\phi_{ 0}s}\] (2) \[= \frac{\phi_{0}}{32\pi^{2}\lambda_{ab}^{2}(T)}-\frac{|M^{*}|}{\ln (\eta\alpha/\sqrt{e})}\frac{T}{T^{*}},\]

where M^{*} is the magnetization value independent of the applied field, or \partial M/\partial lnH=0 at T^{*},

\[-M^{*}\!=\!-M^{*}(T^{*})\!=\!\frac{k_{B}T^{*}}{\phi_{0}s}\ln\!\frac{\eta\alpha} {\sqrt{e}}.\] (3)

s is the distance between centers of two adjacent CuO_{2} blocks. From the XRD analysis, s is found to be 15.3 \AA for pristine Bi2212 and 22.5 \AA for HgI_{2}-Bi2212.5 For the large anisotropic cuprate, it is reasonable to take \ln(\eta\alpha/\sqrt{e}) =1.[15]

Figure 5 displays the magnetization of Bi2212 and HgI_{2}-Bi2212 for fields up to 5 T along the c axis. Both materials exhibit the field-independent magnetization M^{*} predicted by BLK. For pristine Bi2212, M^{*}\!=\!-0.099\!\pm\!0.009 G occurs at T^{*}\!=\!80.7\!\pm\!0.3 K, and for HgI_{2}-Bi2212, M^{*}\!=\!-0.083\!\pm\!0.005 G at T^{*}\!=\!79.2\!\pm\!0.3 K. Using isothermal magnetizations for 0.3 \approx\!H\!\approx 5 T in the reversible region, we evaluate the experimental slopes \partial M/\partial lnH vs T and determine \lambda_{ab}(T) using Eq. (2) (Refs. 14,16) (Fig. 6).

Hao and Clem's original idea is to use a variational method to minimize the Ginzburg-Landau free energy of the mixed state for a high-\kappa type-II superconductor.[12, 13] In this free energy, the |\psi|^{4} is included. In the calculation, they also take into account the depression of the order parameter in the vortex cores. However, this model does not include the thermodynamic fluctuation in the magnetic fields and is not valid near T_{c}. The temperature dependence of \kappa and H_{c} can be evaluated using this model in reversible magnetization. The detailed description of this approach has been given in Refs. 13, 17. In summary, the general equation (4) of Ref. 17 was utilized to fit the reversible magnetization data at each temperature, where the fitting parameters are \kappa and critical fields H_{c}(T). The experimental value of \kappa is determined to give the smallest deviation of H_{c}(T). And the penetration depth \lambda_{ab}(T) and coherence length \xi_{ab}(T) could be extracted from \kappa and H_{c}(T). The effect of the superconducting volume fraction from the magnetic susceptibility at 10 G is included in this analysis by dividing experimental magnetizations with the superconducting volume fraction.

In Fig. 6 the square symbols exhibit the result of a vortex fluctuation analysis. Solid lines are from the BCS temperature dependence of \lambda_{ab}(T) deduced from the relations H_{c2}(T)\!=\!\sqrt{2}\kappa H_{c}(T), \sqrt{2}H_{c}\!=\!\kappa\,\phi_{0}/2\pi\lambda^{2}, and the temperature dependence of H_{c}(T),[12, 13]

\[\frac{H_{c}(T)}{H_{c}(0)} = 1.7369\bigg{[}1-\frac{T}{T_{c}}\bigg{]}\bigg{[}1-0.2730\bigg{(}1 -\frac{T}{T_{c}}\bigg{)}\] (4) \[-0.0949\bigg{[}1-\frac{T}{T_{c}}\bigg{)}^{2}\bigg{]}\quad\ (0.7T_{c}\!\approx\!T\!\approx\!T_{c}).\]

The derived value of \lambda_{ab}(0) from the above formula is 2599 \AA with T_{c}=85 K for Bi2212 and 3046 \AA with T_{c}=84.5 K for HgI_{2}-Bi2212. The circles indicate the \lambda_{ab}(T) calculated from the London model. The unphysical divergence of the penetration depth below T_{c} for the London model and Ho-Clem model originates from ignorance of the positional fluctuation of vortices as indicated by Kogan _et al._[14, 18, 19, 20, 21] The values of \lambda_{ab} are not much different from those of the vortex fluctuation model at low temperature.

It is quite interesting to observe the positional fluctuation of the vortices from the calculated \kappa from the Hao-Clem model where this effect is not considered.[12, 13, 17] The appearance of unphysical parameters such as \lambda_{ab}, \kappa could be evidence of the positional fluctuation of the vortices that is ignored in this fitting. In addition to the temperature-independent \kappa used in the Hao-Clem model, \kappa was also taken as a fitting parameter because \kappa usually decreases as

  temperature increases for type-II superconductors.[22] The \kappa of Bi2212 (Fig. 7) shows the typical behavior of type-II superconductors for T\leq60 K. The change of slope and subsequent divergence of \kappa above 65 K are artificial and are explained by neglecting the positional fluctuation as indicated at \uplambda_{ab}.

What is the HgI_{2} intercalation effect on \kappa? Again, the same Hao-Clem model was used with \kappa as a fitting parameter. It is worthwhile to note the change of the slope d\kappa/dT from negative to positive after intercalation for temperatures below 60 K. The positive d\kappa/dT for HgI_{2}-Bi2212 should be negative, if properly analyzed from the correct theory which includes both the positional fluctuation and vortex core contribution. The effect of the large size HgI_{2} molecules, which reduce the dimensionality of the system drastically by increasing the distance between the CuO_{2} blocks, enhances the two-dimensional vortex fluctuation effect down to 40^{\circ} below T_{c}. In fact, the omission of the vortex fluctuation in the Hao-Clem model could be a useful tool, in reverse, to detect the development of vortex fluctuation for low-dimensional superconductors.

Then what are the correct thermodynamic parameters? The appropriate temperature range should be chosen for the analysis. Fortunately, as seen in Fig. 6, the values of \uplambda_{ab} of Bi2212 from the Hao-Clem model are almost the same as those of the vortex fluctuation model at temperature ranges below 70 K. Since vortex fluctuation is strong at temperatures above 70 K, each analysis at the appropriate temperature range could give the right thermodynamic parameters of Bi2212. However, the situation is not simple for HgI_{2}-Bi2212. The theory of Hao and Clem, which is valid at low-temperature ranges, is screened by an unusually strong vortex fluctuation. The combined theory which contains both the vortex fluctuation and the free energy contributions of the vortex core is needed.

For the thermodynamic parameters at T=0, we used the results of the Hao-Clem model and the two-fluid formula H_{c}(T) = H_{c}(0)[1-(T/T_{c})^{2}]. From this, we obtained H_{c}(0)=9753 (8501) G with T_{c} = 82.2 (83.2) K for Bi2212 (HgI_{2}-Bi2212). The formulas H_{c2}(T) = \phi_{0}/2\,\pi\xi_{ab}^{2} = \sqrt{2}\,\kappa H_{c}(T) and \sqrt{2}\,H_{c} = \kappa\,\phi_{0}/2\pi\uplambda^{2} were used to obtain \xi_{ab}(0)=9.5 A, \uplambda_{ab}(0)=2438 A for Bi2212, \xi_{ab}(0)=8.6 A, \uplambda_{ab}(0)=3192 A for HgI_{2}-Bi2212. These T_{c} values are slightly less than those obtained by utilizing the BLK theory and the T_{c} obtained by applying theories differs from the T_{c,\,\rm{onset}} measured from the 10 G magnetization. These differences of T_{c} originate from the different model fittings and different temperature ranges where the model is valid. This is within the error bar range of the analysis and was reported before for Bi2212 single crystals[11, 23] and other compounds[17, 20, 24] (Table 2).

Our \uplambda_{ab}(0) value of 2500 A is larger than the reported values of 1500 - 2150 A.[11, 25, 26, 27] This may come from the different oxygen contents; i.e., the oxygen contents of ours are not optimized for the highest superconducting transition temperature compared to the published samples. Due to this, our Bi2212 might be underdoped and its \uplambda_{ab}(0) larger than that of the literature as easily seen from Eq. (5) in the following paragraph.

One important result that must be explained is the ratio of \uplambda_{ab}(0) of 1.24 for HgI_{2}-Bi2212 to that of the pristine sample. This ratio could be explained with the Josephson-coupled theory of superconductivity based on the Lawrence-Doniach model by Clem.[9, 10] In this theory,

\[\uplambda_{ab}=\sqrt{\frac{m_{ab}^{\upkappa}c^{\upkappa}}{4\,\pi n_{s}e^{ \upkappa}}\frac{l}{s}},\] (5)

where s is the thickness of the Josephson-coupled superconducting layer and l is the length of the stacking periodicity. If m_{ab}^{\upkappa} and n_{s} are almost the same before and after the intercalation of inert HgI_{2} molecules, then the ratio of 1.24 is sim  ply explained by the effect of the Josephson coupling strength change due to the 47% increase of the space between CuO_{2} blocks.

Now we examine the applicability of the model of Wheatley, Hsu, and Anderson (WHA) to the intercalation compound. According to the WHA model, the superconducting transition temperature of Bi2212 superconductors can be expressed as [8]

\[T_{c} = \uplambda_{0} + \uplambda_{1},\]

where \uplambda_{0} is the interlayer coupling between the nearest planes (intrablock coupling) and \uplambda_{1} is interlayer coupling between the next-nearest planes (interblock coupling).

While HgI_{2} intercalation has little effect on the intrablock coupling, the strength of the interblock coupling is remarkably reduced compared to the case of I_{2} intercalation. Considering the larger lattice expansion of 7.2 A for the HgI_{2} intercalate, it is reasonably expected that HgI_{2} intercalation further reduces the interblock coupling with respect to I_{2} intercalation of the 3.6 A expansion. In this respect, the T_{c} depression upon HgI_{2} intercalation is suggested to be more prominent than that upon iodine intercalation. But the observed T_{c} depression for the HgI_{2} intercalate is even smaller than that for iodine intercalation, which suggests that the coherence hopping of the valence bond pair between CuO_{2} layers (WHA model) is not a unique mechanism for the intercalation compounds.

We found that the enhanced positional fluctuation of vortices and the change of the thermodynamic parameters after the intercalation of the inert molecule HgI_{2} are mainly due to the reduction of the Josephson coupling originating from the increase of the distance between the CuO_{2} blocks. However, the interblock coupling is not critical for the change of the transition temperature.

## IV Conclusion

The superconducting properties of HgI_{2}-intercalated Bi2212 were studied. Several thermodynamic parameters were obtained by comparing the theories suggested by Bulaevskii _et al._ and Hao _et al._ The enhanced effect of fluctuation and the change of the thermodynamic parameters after intercalation of HgI_{2} were successfully explained. Moreover, it was found that HgI_{2} intercalation rarely affects the superconducting transition temperature of Bi2212 while it drastically increases the c-axis parameters. The reduction of the interlayer coupling strength explained the observed thermodynamic properties, but was not consistent with the coherent hopping of the valence bond pair between the CuO_{2} superconducting layers suggested by Wheatley, Hsu, and Anderson.

###### Abstract

By intercalating large HgI_{2} molecules between the Bi_{2}O_{2} layers in Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{y} , the distance between the CuO_{2} blocks was significantly extended up to 7.2 A. The superconducting properties of this system were measured in various magnetic fields applied perpendicular to the CuO_{2} planes. This system showed large positional fluctuation of the vortex even far below the transition temperature due to the reduction of dimensionality. The change of the thermodynamic parameters is well explained by the model of Josephson-coupled superconductivity. However, the interlayer coupling strength did not change the transition temperature drastically, which does not support the suggestion of Wheatley, Hsu, and Anderson of coherent hopping of the valence bond pair between the CuO_{2} layers.

## I Introduction

Although it is well known that the superconductivity of cuprates is very much related to CuO_{2} planes, details of the interlayer coupling effect are not well understood. Since the out-of-plane coherence length \xi_{c} at T=0 K is smaller than the interlayer spacing, there is a dimensional crossover phenomena, where \xi_{c} is comparable to the interlayer distance.[1] The crossover temperature could depend on the interlayer coupling strength. Thus, if this coupling strength can be controlled, it will be very informative in understanding the relationship between interlayer coupling and superconductivity.

Recently, it was reported that a large molecule of HgX_{2} (_X_ =Br, I) could be intercalated between double Bi_{2}O_{2} layers of high-T_{c} Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{y} (Bi2212) superconductors.[2] According to magnetic susceptibility and powder x-ray diffraction measurements, it was found that the HgX_{2} intercalation dropped T_{c} only by a small fraction even with the remarkable lattice expansion along the c axis (\Delta \approx 7.2 A). Such results are different from those of iodine intercalation,[3, 4] with relatively larger T_{c} depressions and smaller lattice expansions. Therefore, since we can extend the distance between the CuO_{2} blocks by the HgX_{2} intercalation, this system would be an excellent example of obtaining the relationship between interblock coupling and superconductivity.

For the case of iodine intercalation, many efforts have been made to explain the effect of intercalation on superconductivity.[3, 4, 5, 6, 7] Actually, superconductivity can be affected by the interlayer Josephson coupling due to the change of the interlayer distance of the CuO_{2} layer and/or the modification of the electronic structure of the CuO_{2} layer. However, instead of Josephson coupling, Wheatley, Hsu, and Anderson[8] (WHA) accepted the coherent hopping of valence bond pairs between CuO_{2} planes. The phase coherence between valence bonds is achieved by pairing the holons. But the applicability of this model to the intercalation compounds has not yet been confirmed because an argument on two possible effects of intercalation, hole doping and the weakening of interblock coupling on the T_{c} depression, has remained unresolved for the case of iodine intercalation.[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

In this paper, we have prepared grain-aligned (HgI_{2})_{0.9}Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{y} (HgI_{2}-Bi2212) and measured its magnetization in various magnetic fields applied along the c axis, and compared it with that of pristine Bi2212. Since HgI_{2} intercalation results in a remarkable lattice expansion, it is expected that the dimensionality of the system could be reduced and the thermodynamic parameters, such as the penetration depth and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, will be significantly modified.

As expected, a reduction of the interlayer coupling strength and vastly enhanced positional fluctuation of the vortex were observed in the magnetization. The measured thermodynamic parameters are well explained by the change of the distance between superconducting CuO_{2} layers,[9, 10] but the change of T_{c} is too small to support the coherent hopping of the valance bond pair suggested by Wheatley, Hsu, and Anderson.[8]

## II Experiment

An HgI_{2}-Bi2212 compound was prepared by vapor transport reaction between the HgI_{2} molecule and the pristine Bi2212. The polycrystalline Bi2212 pellet and mercuric iodine (mole ratio of 1:5), together with free iodine [_P_(1**2**) \approx 1.5 atm] as a transporting agent, were heated in an evacuated Pyrex tube. Details of the sample preparation were given in the previous report.[2] Formation of the HgI_{2} intercalate and its stoichiometry were confirmed by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) using the DuPont 2000 Thermal Analysis Station and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), respectively.

To clarify the intrinsic anisotropic thermodynamic param  eters, Bi2212 and HgI_{2}-Bi2212 were ground down to less than 20 \mum, and were aligned simultaneously inside of the epoxy in a magnetic field of 7 T for 9 h. The resulting samples were examined by x-ray diffraction in Fig. 1. The (00_l_) peaks predominant in the XRD data confirm that the grains are oriented with the c axis along the applied field.

The shielding [zero-field-cooled (ZFC)] and Meissner [field-cooled (FC)] magnetization at 10 G for these samples is shown in Fig. 2. The shielding values at 10 K were 67% for Bi2212 and 61% for HgI_{2}-Bi2212 without a demagnetization correction. The onsets of the superconducting transition for Bi2212 and HgI_{2}-Bi2212 were 85 K and 82 K, respectively. Both of these samples exhibited a very small step near 110 K due to the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} phase with a volume fraction far less than 1%.

The magnetic measurements were performed in a Quantum Designs superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer for fields applied parallel to the c axis. Both background signals that originated from the epoxy and the holder were carefully subtracted.

## III Result and Discussion

According to XRD analysis, the c axis cell parameter of HgI_{2}-Bi2212 is 44.9 A, which corresponds to an increase of 14.3 A compared to that of pristine Bi2212. Since there are two intercalated layers of HgI_{2} for each unit cell of Bi2212, the extent of lattice expansion per each intercalate layer corresponds to 7.2 A, which is almost twice that of the basal increment of iodine intercalation (\Delta d = 3.6 A). Although mercuric iodide intercalation remarkably expands the c axis in Bi2212, it has little effect on the in-plane a and b parameters.

The XRD, after the grain alignment, experiment confirmed that the polycrystalline intercalate was well developed along the (00_l_) planes (Fig. 1). Based on the observed (00_l_) XRD patterns, a one-dimensional Fourier map from the structure factors F_{(00l)} was calculated. As can be seen in Fig.

Figure 3: Schematic structural model for grain-aligned HgI_{2}-intercalated Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{y} along with the one-dimensional Fourier map, which is based on the best fit to the observed XRD patterns.

  3, the one-dimensional Fourier map clearly shows that the mercuric iodide molecule is intercalated in between the Bi2O2 double layer and the HgI2 molecular axis is tilted with an angle of 48^{\circ} with respect to the c axis. Based upon the electron density map, the schematic structure is represented (Fig. 3).

Figure 4 demonstrates the TGA curve of the HgI2 intercalated sample for the temperature range between 20 and 800 ^{\circ}C. The total weight loss at 800 ^{\circ}C is 21.2%, which is in agreement with the calculated value of total loss of (HgI2)03Bi2Sr2CaCu2Oy (20.8%). EPMA also confirms the portion of HgI2 in the sample. The average atomic ratio between Hg, I, and Bi was estimated to be 0.5:1:2, as summarized in Table 1.

This chemically well-defined sample is used for the comparative study on the magnetization of Bi2212 and HgI2-Bi2212. For the detailed analysis, the vortex fluctuation model of Bulaevskii, Ledvij, and Kogan [11] (BLK) and the Hao-Clem model [12, 13] have been used. In the vortex fluctuation model, positional fluctuation of vortices, i.e., thermal distortion of two-dimensional pancake vortices out of the straight stacks near _T_c , is considered. In the model of Hao and Clem, the free energy of the normal cores is also included but the effect of positional fluctuations is not. Thus, this model is valid at a temperature somewhat lower than _T_c , where the vortex fluctuation is not dominant. Both theories are valid at the limited range of temperature. A proper temperature range was chosen for the analysis.

BLK (Ref. [11]) calculated the free energy of a mixed state in the frame of the Lawrence-Doniach model using a harmonic approximation. For the anisotropic ratio g\gg1 (\gamma^{2}\!=\!m_{c}/m_{ab} is the superpair effective mass ratio), for the applied magnetic field H parallel to c axis, and B_{\alpha}\!\approx\!\phi_{0}/s^{2}\gamma^{2}\!\ll\!\!H\!\ll\!\!H_{c2}, they obtained the magnetization from the free energy, which includes the extra contribution of entropy due to thermally distorted pancakes,

\[-M(T,H)\!=\!\frac{\phi_{0}}{32\pi^{2}\lambda_{ab}^{2}}\!\!\!\!\  from the positional fluctuation of vortices. From Eq. (1) the slope \partial M/\partial lnH is easily calculated,

\[\frac{\partial M}{\partial\,\ln\!H} = \frac{\phi_{0}}{32\pi^{2}\lambda_{ab}^{2}(T)}-\frac{k_{B}T}{\phi_{ 0}s}\] (2) \[= \frac{\phi_{0}}{32\pi^{2}\lambda_{ab}^{2}(T)}-\frac{|M^{*}|}{\ln (\eta\alpha/\sqrt{e})}\frac{T}{T^{*}},\]

where M^{*} is the magnetization value independent of the applied field, or \partial M/\partial lnH=0 at T^{*},

\[-M^{*}\!=\!-M^{*}(T^{*})\!=\!\frac{k_{B}T^{*}}{\phi_{0}s}\ln\!\frac{\eta\alpha} {\sqrt{e}}.\] (3)

s is the distance between centers of two adjacent CuO_{2} blocks. From the XRD analysis, s is found to be 15.3 \AA for pristine Bi2212 and 22.5 \AA for HgI_{2}-Bi2212.5 For the large anisotropic cuprate, it is reasonable to take \ln(\eta\alpha/\sqrt{e}) =1.[15]

Figure 5 displays the magnetization of Bi2212 and HgI_{2}-Bi2212 for fields up to 5 T along the c axis. Both materials exhibit the field-independent magnetization M^{*} predicted by BLK. For pristine Bi2212, M^{*}\!=\!-0.099\!\pm\!0.009 G occurs at T^{*}\!=\!80.7\!\pm\!0.3 K, and for HgI_{2}-Bi2212, M^{*}\!=\!-0.083\!\pm\!0.005 G at T^{*}\!=\!79.2\!\pm\!0.3 K. Using isothermal magnetizations for 0.3 \approx\!H\!\approx 5 T in the reversible region, we evaluate the experimental slopes \partial M/\partial lnH vs T and determine \lambda_{ab}(T) using Eq. (2) (Refs. 14,16) (Fig. 6).

Hao and Clem's original idea is to use a variational method to minimize the Ginzburg-Landau free energy of the mixed state for a high-\kappa type-II superconductor.[12, 13] In this free energy, the |\psi|^{4} is included. In the calculation, they also take into account the depression of the order parameter in the vortex cores. However, this model does not include the thermodynamic fluctuation in the magnetic fields and is not valid near T_{c}. The temperature dependence of \kappa and H_{c} can be evaluated using this model in reversible magnetization. The detailed description of this approach has been given in Refs. 13, 17. In summary, the general equation (4) of Ref. 17 was utilized to fit the reversible magnetization data at each temperature, where the fitting parameters are \kappa and critical fields H_{c}(T). The experimental value of \kappa is determined to give the smallest deviation of H_{c}(T). And the penetration depth \lambda_{ab}(T) and coherence length \xi_{ab}(T) could be extracted from \kappa and H_{c}(T). The effect of the superconducting volume fraction from the magnetic susceptibility at 10 G is included in this analysis by dividing experimental magnetizations with the superconducting volume fraction.

In Fig. 6 the square symbols exhibit the result of a vortex fluctuation analysis. Solid lines are from the BCS temperature dependence of \lambda_{ab}(T) deduced from the relations H_{c2}(T)\!=\!\sqrt{2}\kappa H_{c}(T), \sqrt{2}H_{c}\!=\!\kappa\,\phi_{0}/2\pi\lambda^{2}, and the temperature dependence of H_{c}(T),[12, 13]

\[\frac{H_{c}(T)}{H_{c}(0)} = 1.7369\bigg{[}1-\frac{T}{T_{c}}\bigg{]}\bigg{[}1-0.2730\bigg{(}1 -\frac{T}{T_{c}}\bigg{)}\] (4) \[-0.0949\bigg{[}1-\frac{T}{T_{c}}\bigg{)}^{2}\bigg{]}\quad\ (0.7T_{c}\!\approx\!T\!\approx\!T_{c}).\]

The derived value of \lambda_{ab}(0) from the above formula is 2599 \AA with T_{c}=85 K for Bi2212 and 3046 \AA with T_{c}=84.5 K for HgI_{2}-Bi2212. The circles indicate the \lambda_{ab}(T) calculated from the London model. The unphysical divergence of the penetration depth below T_{c} for the London model and Ho-Clem model originates from ignorance of the positional fluctuation of vortices as indicated by Kogan _et al._[14, 18, 19, 20, 21] The values of \lambda_{ab} are not much different from those of the vortex fluctuation model at low temperature.

It is quite interesting to observe the positional fluctuation of the vortices from the calculated \kappa from the Hao-Clem model where this effect is not considered.[12, 13, 17] The appearance of unphysical parameters such as \lambda_{ab}, \kappa could be evidence of the positional fluctuation of the vortices that is ignored in this fitting. In addition to the temperature-independent \kappa used in the Hao-Clem model, \kappa was also taken as a fitting parameter because \kappa usually decreases as

  temperature increases for type-II superconductors.[22] The \kappa of Bi2212 (Fig. 7) shows the typical behavior of type-II superconductors for T\leq60 K. The change of slope and subsequent divergence of \kappa above 65 K are artificial and are explained by neglecting the positional fluctuation as indicated at \uplambda_{ab}.

What is the HgI_{2} intercalation effect on \kappa? Again, the same Hao-Clem model was used with \kappa as a fitting parameter. It is worthwhile to note the change of the slope d\kappa/dT from negative to positive after intercalation for temperatures below 60 K. The positive d\kappa/dT for HgI_{2}-Bi2212 should be negative, if properly analyzed from the correct theory which includes both the positional fluctuation and vortex core contribution. The effect of the large size HgI_{2} molecules, which reduce the dimensionality of the system drastically by increasing the distance between the CuO_{2} blocks, enhances the two-dimensional vortex fluctuation effect down to 40^{\circ} below T_{c}. In fact, the omission of the vortex fluctuation in the Hao-Clem model could be a useful tool, in reverse, to detect the development of vortex fluctuation for low-dimensional superconductors.

Then what are the correct thermodynamic parameters? The appropriate temperature range should be chosen for the analysis. Fortunately, as seen in Fig. 6, the values of \uplambda_{ab} of Bi2212 from the Hao-Clem model are almost the same as those of the vortex fluctuation model at temperature ranges below 70 K. Since vortex fluctuation is strong at temperatures above 70 K, each analysis at the appropriate temperature range could give the right thermodynamic parameters of Bi2212. However, the situation is not simple for HgI_{2}-Bi2212. The theory of Hao and Clem, which is valid at low-temperature ranges, is screened by an unusually strong vortex fluctuation. The combined theory which contains both the vortex fluctuation and the free energy contributions of the vortex core is needed.

For the thermodynamic parameters at T=0, we used the results of the Hao-Clem model and the two-fluid formula H_{c}(T) = H_{c}(0)[1-(T/T_{c})^{2}]. From this, we obtained H_{c}(0)=9753 (8501) G with T_{c} = 82.2 (83.2) K for Bi2212 (HgI_{2}-Bi2212). The formulas H_{c2}(T) = \phi_{0}/2\,\pi\xi_{ab}^{2} = \sqrt{2}\,\kappa H_{c}(T) and \sqrt{2}\,H_{c} = \kappa\,\phi_{0}/2\pi\uplambda^{2} were used to obtain \xi_{ab}(0)=9.5 A, \uplambda_{ab}(0)=2438 A for Bi2212, \xi_{ab}(0)=8.6 A, \uplambda_{ab}(0)=3192 A for HgI_{2}-Bi2212. These T_{c} values are slightly less than those obtained by utilizing the BLK theory and the T_{c} obtained by applying theories differs from the T_{c,\,\rm{onset}} measured from the 10 G magnetization. These differences of T_{c} originate from the different model fittings and different temperature ranges where the model is valid. This is within the error bar range of the analysis and was reported before for Bi2212 single crystals[11, 23] and other compounds[17, 20, 24] (Table 2).

Our \uplambda_{ab}(0) value of 2500 A is larger than the reported values of 1500 - 2150 A.[11, 25, 26, 27] This may come from the different oxygen contents; i.e., the oxygen contents of ours are not optimized for the highest superconducting transition temperature compared to the published samples. Due to this, our Bi2212 might be underdoped and its \uplambda_{ab}(0) larger than that of the literature as easily seen from Eq. (5) in the following paragraph.

One important result that must be explained is the ratio of \uplambda_{ab}(0) of 1.24 for HgI_{2}-Bi2212 to that of the pristine sample. This ratio could be explained with the Josephson-coupled theory of superconductivity based on the Lawrence-Doniach model by Clem.[9, 10] In this theory,

\[\uplambda_{ab}=\sqrt{\frac{m_{ab}^{\upkappa}c^{\upkappa}}{4\,\pi n_{s}e^{ \upkappa}}\frac{l}{s}},\] (5)

where s is the thickness of the Josephson-coupled superconducting layer and l is the length of the stacking periodicity. If m_{ab}^{\upkappa} and n_{s} are almost the same before and after the intercalation of inert HgI_{2} molecules, then the ratio of 1.24 is sim  ply explained by the effect of the Josephson coupling strength change due to the 47% increase of the space between CuO_{2} blocks.

Now we examine the applicability of the model of Wheatley, Hsu, and Anderson (WHA) to the intercalation compound. According to the WHA model, the superconducting transition temperature of Bi2212 superconductors can be expressed as [8]

\[T_{c} = \uplambda_{0} + \uplambda_{1},\]

where \uplambda_{0} is the interlayer coupling between the nearest planes (intrablock coupling) and \uplambda_{1} is interlayer coupling between the next-nearest planes (interblock coupling).

While HgI_{2} intercalation has little effect on the intrablock coupling, the strength of the interblock coupling is remarkably reduced compared to the case of I_{2} intercalation. Considering the larger lattice expansion of 7.2 A for the HgI_{2} intercalate, it is reasonably expected that HgI_{2} intercalation further reduces the interblock coupling with respect to I_{2} intercalation of the 3.6 A expansion. In this respect, the T_{c} depression upon HgI_{2} intercalation is suggested to be more prominent than that upon iodine intercalation. But the observed T_{c} depression for the HgI_{2} intercalate is even smaller than that for iodine intercalation, which suggests that the coherence hopping of the valence bond pair between CuO_{2} layers (WHA model) is not a unique mechanism for the intercalation compounds.

We found that the enhanced positional fluctuation of vortices and the change of the thermodynamic parameters after the intercalation of the inert molecule HgI_{2} are mainly due to the reduction of the Josephson coupling originating from the increase of the distance between the CuO_{2} blocks. However, the interblock coupling is not critical for the change of the transition temperature.

## IV Conclusion

The superconducting properties of HgI_{2}-intercalated Bi2212 were studied. Several thermodynamic parameters were obtained by comparing the theories suggested by Bulaevskii _et al._ and Hao _et al._ The enhanced effect of fluctuation and the change of the thermodynamic parameters after intercalation of HgI_{2} were successfully explained. Moreover, it was found that HgI_{2} intercalation rarely affects the superconducting transition temperature of Bi2212 while it drastically increases the c-axis parameters. The reduction of the interlayer coupling strength explained the observed thermodynamic properties, but was not consistent with the coherent hopping of the valence bond pair between the CuO_{2} superconducting layers suggested by Wheatley, Hsu, and Anderson.
