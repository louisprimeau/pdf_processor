## I Introduction

The recent discovery of superconductivity in iron pnictides [1] has generated an intense research activity, in part because they provide an unexpected and very interesting scenario to study the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity. [2] The interest for these compounds is enhanced by the fact that they share many properties with the high-T_{c} cuprates (HTSC), as the layered structure, a similar evolution of the superconducting parameters with doping, and the proximity to a magnetic transition. [2] As it is still the case of the HTSC, the pairing mechanism in superconducting iron pnictides is not yet known, making the phenomenological descriptions of their superconducting transition a central issue of the present researches on these compounds. As first established in the pioneering experiments by Tinkham and coworkers in low-T_{c} metallic superconductors, [3] a powerful tool to probe at a phenomenological level the own nature of a superconducting transition is the diamagnetism induced above T_{c} by thermally activated Cooper pairs. [4] The fluctuation diamagnetism above T_{c} (sometimes called _precursor diamagnetism_) was also early used to characterize at a phenomenological level the superconducting transition in both optimally-doped [5, 6] and underdoped [7] high-T_{c} cuprates. However, in spite of its interest the precursor diamagnetism received little attention due to both the relative smallness of the superconducting fluctuation effects above T_{c} in these compounds and, mainly, to the need of high-quality single crystals, with a relatively sharp superconducting transition. [8]

In this paper we report measurements in superconducting iron pnictides of the fluctuation-induced diamagnetism above T_{c}, which were possible by applying high-resolution magnetometry to a Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} single crystal with an excellent chemical and structural quality. These data allow an experimental demonstration that the superconducting transition of these materials may be explained at a phenomenological level in terms of the Gaussian Ginzburg-Landau approach for three-dimensional anisotropic superconductors (3D-AGL). This conclusion excludes phase incoherent superconductivity above T_{c} in iron pnictides, a long standing but still at present debated issue of the HTSC physics. [9, 10] Also, it provides a direct check of the fluctuations dimensionality: while bulk low-T_{c} superconductors (LTSC) behave as three-dimensional (3D) and most HTSC as two-dimensional (2D), [4, 5, 6] it has been recently proposed that iron pnictides are in an intermediate regime as a consequence of their moderate anisotropy. [11] In relation with this, another interesting aspect of our work is that the fluctuation diamagnetism is probed with magnetic fields applied along the two main crystallographic directions. This allows to accede directly to the superconducting anisotropy factor, but also to study an interesting issue recently observed in other moderately anisotropic superconductor (NbSe_{2}), as it is the anisotropy of nonlocal electrodynamic effects. [12]

## II Experimental details and results

### Sample fabrication and characterization

The Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} sample (with x=0.28) used in this work is a \sim 1.1\times 0.7\times 0.1 mm^{3} (430 \mug) single crystal. Details of its growth procedure and characterization may be seen in Ref. [13]. We have chosen such a small crystal because it presents a well-defined transition temperature which is essential to study critical phenomena. The measurements were performed with a magnetometer based in the superconducting quantum interference (Quantum Design, model MPMS-XL).

  To position the crystal with the magnetic field, H, applied parallel to the crystal ab layers, we used a quartz sample holder (0.3 cm in diameter, 22 cm in length) to which the crystal was glued with GE varnish. Two plastic rods at the sample holder ends (\sim 0.3 mm smaller than the sample space diameter) ensured that its alignment was better than 0.1^{\circ}. For the measurements with H\perp ab we made a groove (\sim 0.3 mm wide) in the sample holder into which the crystal was glued also with GE varnish. The crystal alignment was checked by optical microscopy to be better than 5^{\circ}. This allowed to determine the anisotropy factor from the anisotropy of the precursor diamagnetism with a \sim 0.5% uncertainty.[14]

As a first magnetic characterization, in Fig. 1 it is presented the temperature dependence of the zero-field-cooled ZFC and field-cooled FC magnetic susceptibilities, measured with a magnetic field of 0.5 mT perpendicular to the ab planes. These measurements were corrected for demagnetizing effects by using as demagnetizing factor D=0.78, which was obtained by approximating the crystal shape by the inscribed ellipsoid. A proof of the adequacy of this procedure is that the ZFC magnetic susceptibility in the Meissner region is close to the ideal value (-1) well below T_{c}. From these curves we estimated T_{c}\approx 33.2\pm 0.2 K, which attests the excellent quality of the sample, and allows to study the fluctuation-induced magnetization in almost the whole temperature range above T_{c}. Such a small transition width is in good agreement with the one determined from the resistive transition of crystals with the same composition and grown following the same procedure.[13]

### Measurements of the fluctuation diamagnetism around T_{c} and background subtraction

To measure the effect of superconducting fluctuations above T_{c} (which according to the 3D-AGL approach, see below, is about 10^{-6}-10^{-7} emu), we used the _reciprocating sample option_. It produces sinusoidal oscillations of the sample about the center of the detection system and improves the resolution by about two orders of magnitude with respect to the conventional DC option. Data were taken by waiting \sim 3 min for complete stabilization after the temperature was within 0.5% the target temperature. For each temperature we averaged six measurements consisting of 15 cycles at 1 Hz frequency. The final resolution in magnetic moment, m, was in the \sim 10^{-8} emu range.

An example of the as measured m(T) data above T_{c} is presented in Fig. 2(a). As may be clearly seen already in this figure, the m(T) curves present a _rounding_ just above T_{c} (a factor \sim 3 larger in amplitude when H\perp ab), which extends few degrees above T_{c}. In view of the sharp low-field diamagnetic transition (Fig. 1) such a rounding cannot be attributed to T_{c} inhomogeneities, and is evidence of the presence of an anisotropic precursor diamagnetism in these materials. In the detail around T_{c} presented in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c), it is clearly seen that the reversible region extends few degrees below T_{c}, allowing to study the _critical_ fluctuation regime, where m(T) presents a similar anisotropy.

The fluctuation-induced contribution was determined from the as measured m(T) by subtracting the _background_ magnetic moment, m_{B}(T), coming from the crystal normal state and in a much lesser extent from the sample holder (this last contribution was estimated to be in the 10^{-6} emu range). Such a background contribution was determined by fitting the function

\[m_{B}(T)=a+bT+\frac{c}{T}\] (1)

to the raw data in the temperature interval between 37 and 50 K (a, b, and c are free parameters). The lower bound corresponds to a temperature above which the fluctuation-induced magnetic moment is expected to be smaller than the experimental uncertainty (see below). It is worth noting that the use of other plausible functions for m_{B}(T), for instance m_{B}(T)=a+b/(T-c), leads to imperceptible changes in the scale of Fig. 2(a).

## III Data analysis

### Theoretical background

In view of the moderate anisotropy observed, the results of Fig. 2 were analyzed in the framework of the 3D-AGL approach. This theory predicts that the fluctuation-induced magnetization for magnetic fields applied perpendicular or parallel to the crystal ab layers (M_{\perp} or M_{\parallel}, respectively) may be obtained from the result for 3D isotropic materials, M_{\rm iso}, through[15, 16, 17]

\[M_{\perp}(H)=\gamma\,M_{\rm iso}(H)\] (2)

and

\[M_{\parallel}(H)=M_{\rm iso}\bigg{(}\frac{H}{\gamma}\bigg{)}=\frac{1}{\gamma} \,M_{\perp}\bigg{(}\frac{H}{\gamma}\bigg{)}\,.\] (3)

where \gamma is the superconducting anisotropy factor. This transformation was introduced by Klemm and Clem[15] and generalized by Blatter[16] and by Hao and Clem[17] to different

Figure 1: (Color online) Temperature dependence of the FC and ZFC magnetic susceptibility (already corrected for demagnetizing effects) obtained with a 0.5 mT magnetic field perpendicular to the ab layers. T_{c} and its uncertainty were estimated from the maximum of d\chi^{2\rm FC}(T)/dT (solid line), and from the high-temperature half-width at half-maximum (this eludes the possible widening associated to the transit through the mixed state).

  observables and different regions in the H-T phase diagram. In particular, it was shown to be also valid for the fluctuation region above T_{c}.[16] For isotropic materials, the fluctuation magnetization above T_{c} was calculated in Ref. [18] in the framework of a Gaussian GL approach including a _total-energy_ cutoff in the fluctuation spectrum.[19] By combining that result with Eqs. (2) and (3) it follows that

\[M_{\perp} = -\frac{k_{B}T\mu_{0}H\gamma\xi_{ab}(0)}{3\phi_{0}^{2}}\left[\frac{ \arctan\sqrt{(c-\varepsilon)/\varepsilon}}{\sqrt{\varepsilon}}\right.\] (4) \[\left.-\frac{\arctan\sqrt{(c-\varepsilon)/c}}{\sqrt{c}}\right]\]

and

\[M_{1}=\frac{M_{\perp}}{\gamma^{2}},\] (5)

where \varepsilon=\ln(T/T_{c}) is the reduced temperature, \xi_{ab}(0) the _  for the two free parameters, \xi_{ab}(0)=1.5 nm (which leads to \mu_{0}dH_{c2}^{\perp}/dT=-4.2 T/K near T_{c}) and \gamma=1.8, are close to the ones in the literature.[23] These values lead to a _transverse_ coherence length \xi_{c}(0)=\xi_{ab}(0)/\gamma=0.83 nm, larger than the Fe-layers periodicity length (\sim0.66 nm),[13] which justifies the applicability of the 3D-AGL approach. The \xi_{ab}(0) value is well within the ones in HTSC, and \gamma is just a few times smaller than in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. These similarities contrast with the differences between their precursor diamagnetism (allegedly unconventional in the HTSC).[9] Finally, \xi_{ab}(0) is much shorter than in the moderately anisotropic 2H-NbSe_{2}, which could explain the nonobservation of nonlocal electrodynamic effects when H\perp ab in the present case.[12]

### Fluctuation diamagnetism in the critical region around T_{c}

As a check of consistency of the above analysis we studied the data in the critical region, closer to the H-dependent critical temperature, where the fluctuations amplitude is so large that the Gaussian approximation breaks down.[4] This region is bounded by the so-called _Ginzburg criterion_,[24] which according to the transformation to anisotropic materials may be written as

\[T\approx T_{c}^{\perp}(H)\pm T_{c}\left[\frac{4\pi k_{B}\mu_{0}H}{\Delta c\xi _{c}(0)\phi_{0}}\right]^{2/3}\] (7)

for H\perp ab, and

\[T\approx T_{c}^{\parallel}(H)\pm T_{c}\left[\frac{4\pi k_{B}\mu_{0}H}{\Delta c \xi_{c}(0)\gamma\phi_{0}}\right]^{2/3}\] (8)

for H\parallel ab, where \Delta c is the specific-heat jump at T_{c}. In this region, the 3D-GL approach in the lowest-Landau-level approximation predicts that M_{\perp}(T,H) follows a scaling behavior, m_{\perp}=f_{\perp}(t_{\perp}), the scaling variables being[25]

\[m_{\perp}\equiv\frac{M_{\perp}}{(HT)^{2/3}}\] (9)

and

\[t_{\perp}\equiv\frac{T-T_{c}^{\perp}(H)}{(HT)^{2/3}},\] (10)

where T_{c}^{\perp}(H)=T_{c}[1-H/H_{c2}^{\perp}(0)]. According to Eq. (3), M_{\parallel}(T,H) should scale as

\[m_{\parallel}=f_{\parallel}(t_{\parallel})=\frac{f_{\perp}(t_{\parallel}\gamma ^{2/3})}{\gamma^{5/3}}\] (11  to extend these measurements to other iron pnictides with other type of substitution and doping levels, and also in larger samples to confirm whether the onset of the precursor diamagnetism is close to 1.7 T_{c}, as proposed by the total-energy cutoff scenario.

### Sample fabrication and characterization

The Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} sample (with x=0.28) used in this work is a \sim 1.1\times 0.7\times 0.1 mm^{3} (430 \mug) single crystal. Details of its growth procedure and characterization may be seen in Ref. [13]. We have chosen such a small crystal because it presents a well-defined transition temperature which is essential to study critical phenomena. The measurements were performed with a magnetometer based in the superconducting quantum interference (Quantum Design, model MPMS-XL).

  To position the crystal with the magnetic field, H, applied parallel to the crystal ab layers, we used a quartz sample holder (0.3 cm in diameter, 22 cm in length) to which the crystal was glued with GE varnish. Two plastic rods at the sample holder ends (\sim 0.3 mm smaller than the sample space diameter) ensured that its alignment was better than 0.1^{\circ}. For the measurements with H\perp ab we made a groove (\sim 0.3 mm wide) in the sample holder into which the crystal was glued also with GE varnish. The crystal alignment was checked by optical microscopy to be better than 5^{\circ}. This allowed to determine the anisotropy factor from the anisotropy of the precursor diamagnetism with a \sim 0.5% uncertainty.[14]

As a first magnetic characterization, in Fig. 1 it is presented the temperature dependence of the zero-field-cooled ZFC and field-cooled FC magnetic susceptibilities, measured with a magnetic field of 0.5 mT perpendicular to the ab planes. These measurements were corrected for demagnetizing effects by using as demagnetizing factor D=0.78, which was obtained by approximating the crystal shape by the inscribed ellipsoid. A proof of the adequacy of this procedure is that the ZFC magnetic susceptibility in the Meissner region is close to the ideal value (-1) well below T_{c}. From these curves we estimated T_{c}\approx 33.2\pm 0.2 K, which attests the excellent quality of the sample, and allows to study the fluctuation-induced magnetization in almost the whole temperature range above T_{c}. Such a small transition width is in good agreement with the one determined from the resistive transition of crystals with the same composition and grown following the same procedure.[13]

Such a background contribution was determined by fitting the function

\[m_{B}(T)=a+bT+\frac{c}{T}\] (1)

to the raw data in the temperature interval between 37 and 50 K (a, b, and c are free parameters). The lower bound corresponds to a temperature above which the fluctuation-induced magnetic moment is expected to be smaller than the experimental uncertainty (see below). It is worth noting that the use of other plausible functions for m_{B}(T), for instance m_{B}(T)=a+b/(T-c), leads to imperceptible changes in the scale of Fig. 2(a).

## III Data analysis

### Theoretical background

In view of the moderate anisotropy observed, the results of Fig. 2 were analyzed in the framework of the 3D-AGL approach. This theory predicts that the fluctuation-induced magnetization for magnetic fields applied perpendicular or parallel to the crystal ab layers (M_{\perp} or M_{\parallel}, respectively) may be obtained from the result for 3D isotropic materials, M_{\rm iso}, through[15, 16, 17]

\[M_{\perp}(H)=\gamma\,M_{\rm iso}(H)\] (2)

and

\[M_{\parallel}(H)=M_{\rm iso}\bigg{(}\frac{H}{\gamma}\bigg{)}=\frac{1}{\gamma} \,M_{\perp}\bigg{(}\frac{H}{\gamma}\bigg{)}\,.\] (3)

where \gamma is the superconducting anisotropy factor. This transformation was introduced by Klemm and Clem[15] and generalized by Blatter[16] and by Hao and Clem[17] to different

Figure 1: (Color online) Temperature dependence of the FC and ZFC magnetic susceptibility (already corrected for demagnetizing effects) obtained with a 0.5 mT magnetic field perpendicular to the ab layers. T_{c} and its uncertainty were estimated from the maximum of d\chi^{2\rm FC}(T)/dT (solid line), and from the high-temperature half-width at half-maximum (this eludes the possible widening associated to the transit through the mixed state).

  observables and different regions in the H-T phase diagram. In particular, it was shown to be also valid for the fluctuation region above T_{c}.[16] For isotropic materials, the fluctuation magnetization above T_{c} was calculated in Ref. [18] in the framework of a Gaussian GL approach including a _total-energy_ cutoff in the fluctuation spectrum.[19] By combining that result with Eqs. (2) and (3) it follows that

\[M_{\perp} = -\frac{k_{B}T\mu_{0}H\gamma\xi_{ab}(0)}{3\phi_{0}^{2}}\left[\frac{ \arctan\sqrt{(c-\varepsilon)/\varepsilon}}{\sqrt{\varepsilon}}\right.\] (4) \[\left.-\frac{\arctan\sqrt{(c-\varepsilon)/c}}{\sqrt{c}}\right]\]

and

\[M_{1}=\frac{M_{\perp}}{\gamma^{2}},\] (5)

where \varepsilon=\ln(T/T_{c}) is the reduced temperature, \xi_{ab}(0) the _  for the two free parameters, \xi_{ab}(0)=1.5 nm (which leads to \mu_{0}dH_{c2}^{\perp}/dT=-4.2 T/K near T_{c}) and \gamma=1.8, are close to the ones in the literature.[23] These values lead to a _transverse_ coherence length \xi_{c}(0)=\xi_{ab}(0)/\gamma=0.83 nm, larger than the Fe-layers periodicity length (\sim0.66 nm),[13] which justifies the applicability of the 3D-AGL approach. The \xi_{ab}(0) value is well within the ones in HTSC, and \gamma is just a few times smaller than in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. These similarities contrast with the differences between their precursor diamagnetism (allegedly unconventional in the HTSC).[9] Finally, \xi_{ab}(0) is much shorter than in the moderately anisotropic 2H-NbSe_{2}, which could explain the nonobservation of nonlocal electrodynamic effects when H\perp ab in the present case.[12]

### Fluctuation diamagnetism in the critical region around T_{c}

As a check of consistency of the above analysis we studied the data in the critical region, closer to the H-dependent critical temperature, where the fluctuations amplitude is so large that the Gaussian approximation breaks down.[4] This region is bounded by the so-called _Ginzburg criterion_,[24] which according to the transformation to anisotropic materials may be written as

\[T\approx T_{c}^{\perp}(H)\pm T_{c}\left[\frac{4\pi k_{B}\mu_{0}H}{\Delta c\xi _{c}(0)\phi_{0}}\right]^{2/3}\] (7)

for H\perp ab, and

\[T\approx T_{c}^{\parallel}(H)\pm T_{c}\left[\frac{4\pi k_{B}\mu_{0}H}{\Delta c \xi_{c}(0)\gamma\phi_{0}}\right]^{2/3}\] (8)

for H\parallel ab, where \Delta c is the specific-heat jump at T_{c}. In this region, the 3D-GL approach in the lowest-Landau-level approximation predicts that M_{\perp}(T,H) follows a scaling behavior, m_{\perp}=f_{\perp}(t_{\perp}), the scaling variables being[25]

\[m_{\perp}\equiv\frac{M_{\perp}}{(HT)^{2/3}}\] (9)

and

\[t_{\perp}\equiv\frac{T-T_{c}^{\perp}(H)}{(HT)^{2/3}},\] (10)

where T_{c}^{\perp}(H)=T_{c}[1-H/H_{c2}^{\perp}(0)]. According to Eq. (3), M_{\parallel}(T,H) should scale as

\[m_{\parallel}=f_{\parallel}(t_{\parallel})=\frac{f_{\perp}(t_{\parallel}\gamma ^{2/3})}{\gamma^{5/3}}\] (11  to extend these measurements to other iron pnictides with other type of substitution and doping levels, and also in larger samples to confirm whether the onset of the precursor diamagnetism is close to 1.7 T_{c}, as proposed by the total-energy cutoff scenario.
