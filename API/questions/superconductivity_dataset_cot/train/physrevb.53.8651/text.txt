Specific-heat data of Fe-doped Bi1.8Pb0.2Sr2Ca(Cu1-_x_Fe)2O8 in the range 2-20 K are presented for \(x\) = 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 %. The data are compared with our previous measurements on Co-doped bismuth-strontium-calcium-copper oxide superconductors of nominal composition Bi1.8Sr2CaCu2O8 (BISCO 2212). Both Fe and Co are magnetic substitutions with effective moments close to their free-ion value. In the normal state the magnetic susceptibility increases by more than a factor 2 over the doping range due to effective-mass enhancement. In the superconducting state both ions act as magnetic pair breakers. For Co doping the normal-state linear term \(g\) is observed, enhanced due to the effective-mass increase. For Fe doping we observe a large anomalous contribution to the electronic specific heat starting near 15 K and leading at the lowest temperature to a linear term \(g\)0 = 72 mJ/mole K2 (1 mole = 1 formula unit). The anomalous term is typical of heavy fermion behavior. Comparison with specific-heat data of Co-doped BISCO 2212 suggests that hybridization between 3\(d\) electrons of the dopant and the planar carriers is more effective for Fe doping than for Co doping.

In a previous publication,1 we reported on the low-temperature specific heat of Zn- and Co-doped bismuth-strontium-calcium-copper oxide superconductors of nominal composition Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (BISCO). The main result of this work was that Co substitution induces a large linear term in the specific heat, in contrast to Zn substitution, which hardly changes the low-temperature specific heat. From normal-state susceptibility measurements, it was found that Co is a magnetic substitution in BISCO, whereas Zn substitutes nonmagnetically. In the present work, we report our results on the specific heat of Fe-doped BISCO 2212. Fe also substitutes magnetically, and this investigation should therefore be helpful in outlining the relationship between the appearance of a low-temperature linear term in the specific heat of cuprate superconductors and the substitution of magnetic cations. We found again a linear term at low temperatures in Fe-doped BISCO, but this term is much larger than in Co-substituted BISCO. The low-temperature limiting value of \(g\) is at least four times that for Co substitution and much larger than any estimated normal-state linear term. In contrast to this, the normal-state properties of Co- and Fe-substituted BISCO are quite similar. It is possible that hybridization of the Fe wave function with the planar oxygen and copper wave function produces a heavy-fermion-like enhancement of the electronic specific heat, in contrast to the Co case. We will present in this paper the results for Fe-doped BISCO and compare them with the Co-doped BISCO results.

The measurements were conducted on samples of Bi1.8Pb0.2Sr2Ca(Cu1-_x_Fe)2O8, for \(x\) = 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 %. The samples were produced by solid-state sintering methods from high-purity Bi2O3, PbO, SrO, CaO, CuO, and Fe2O3. The oxide mixtures were calcined in air for 24 h at 800 degC and then sintered for a total of 80 h at 845 degC in air. The batches were respond a total of four times in the sintering program. X-ray powder diffraction shows the presence of the 2212 phase, and no indication of the 2223 phase. Small impurity concentrations around 3% were noted.

The superconducting transitions were observed in low fields (1 G) in a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer. We found that the magnetic transitions have a broad onset and that the transition width increases with increasing Fe concentration or decreasing transition temperature. The transition temperatures given as part of Table 3 are taken at the 5% level of the field-cooled (Meissner) magnetization (in a field of 1 G). In Fig. 1, we show these transition temperatures as function of Fe concentration as well as the temperature at the 90% level of the Meissner signal.

Investigations of Zn, Fe, and Co doping in the 2212 structure were published by Maeda _et al._2 They used a slightly different stoichiometry, Bi2(Sr0.6Ca0.4)(Cu1-_x_M_x)O7, and found solution limits of \(x\) = 1.5% (_M_ = Zn), \(x\) = 8% (_M_ = Fe), and \(x\) = 10% (_M_ = Co). We also found a rapid increase in impurity phases when we attempted to exceed \(x\) = 8% for either Fe or Co substitution. The decrease in transition temperature \(T_{c}\) in our samples is similar to those found by Maeda _et al._

Figure 1: The temperature \(T_{c}\) at 5 and 90 % of the Meissner signal at 0 K (_M_0), measured in a field of 1 G.

 In Fig. 2 we show the results of our measurements of the normal-state susceptibility as function of temperature for all Fe concentrations; included are also results for an unsubstituted sample. It is obvious that Fe substitution introduces both a Curie term \(C/T\), as well as an enhanced constant term \(\chi_{0}\). We fitted the results therefore to the form

\[\chi = \chi_{0} + \frac{C}{T},\]

the resulting values of \(\chi_{0}\) and \(C\) are given in Table 1. Similar results are given in Table 2 for Co-substituted samples. We attribute the Curie term \(C/T\) (absent in the unsubstituted case) to the magnetic moment of the substituted cation, and interpret the constant term \(\chi_{0}\) as Pauli susceptibility (after correction for diamagnetic core contributions.

The measurements of the normal-state susceptibility \(\chi\) were confined to the temperature range 70-250 K. The lower temperature is well above the transition temperature \(T_{c}\) for all Fe concentrations. It is, therefore, unlikely that fluctuation effects will affect these data. In Ref. 18, it was found that the fluctuation range in Bi 2212 reaches to about 10% of the transition temperature above \(T_{c}\) (or about 10 K). This puts even the measurements for \(x_{\rm Fe}\) = 1% (\(T_{c}\) = 54.8 K) outside the fluctuation range. As expected, we have not observed any deviation from relation (1) at the low-temperature range for any Fe concentration.

The effective moment \(p_{\rm eff}\), introduced both for Fe and Co substitution was obtained from the measured Curie constant:

\[C = \frac{N(p_{\rm eff}\mu_{B})^{2}}{3k_{B}T},\]

where \(\mu_{B}\) is the Bohr magneton and \(N\) is the molar concentration of Fe or Co. The effective moments are given in Tables 1 and 2 and shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that \(p_{\rm eff}\) is slightly concentration dependent, decreasing with increasing solute concentration. In the low concentration limit \(p_{\rm eff}\) extrapolates within experimental uncertainty to the moments for the isolated Fe\({}^{2^{+}}\) ion (\(p_{\rm eff}\) = 4.90), or Co\({}^{2^{+}}\) ion (\(p_{\rm eff}\) = 3.87), assuming quenching of the orbital moment. The spectroscopic state for Fe would then be \({}^{5}D_{4}\), and for Co, \({}^{4}F_{92}\). It is clear that the Curie term is directly associated with the solute magnetic moments, and that this moment is very close to the isolated ion value in the limit of infinite dilution. The drop in \(p_{\rm eff}\) (which amounts to about 15% for \(x\) = 8%), can have several reasons. It could be due to spin fluctuations, or a small antiferromagnetic interaction.

Madea _et al._2 also found a Curie term in their Fe- and Co-substituted samples. They obtained for both cases a \(p_{\rm eff}\) of 3.6. This is in quite good agreement with our Co result but distinctly below the \(p_{\rm eff}\) we find for Fe substitution, although a slightly larger \(p_{\rm eff}\) for Fe substitution is also evident in their results.

In order to discuss the temperature-independent Pauli susceptibility \(\chi_{0}\), we have to correct the data for the diamagnetic core contributions. We estimated these corrections from data given by Gupta3 from which we estimate the temperature-independent diamagnetic susceptibility as \(\chi_{\rm dia}\) = \(-\) 2.05\(\times 10^{-4}\) emu/mole, virtually independent of Fe or Co concentration. The "mole" refers here, as in the rest of the paper, to one formula unit, unless reference is specifically made to the Fe or Co content. We neglect the (unknown) van Vleck contribution. For the unsubstituted sample, the susceptibility shows no Curie contribution, and a small constant paramagnetic susceptibility of about 1.0\(\times 10^{-4}\) emu/mole. The corrected susceptibility for this case can then be estimated as

Figure 3: The effective magnetic moment of Fe and Co in substituted Bi\({}_{1.8}\)Pb\({}_{0.2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Ca(Cu\({}_{1-x}\)_M\({}_{x}\)_)\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\), \(M\) = Fe or Co, as function of substitution concentration.

  3.05x10-4 emu/mole. The interpretation of this constant susceptibility as Pauli susceptibility of free carriers is reasonable. An estimate of _x_Pauli from the density of states at the Fermi surface,4,5_N_(\(E_{F}\)) = 3 states/eV cell, leads to _x_Pauli = 1.94x10-4 emu/mole. The observed corrected temperature-independent susceptibility is therefore close to that expected from band-structure calculations. Uncertainties in the diamagnetics corrections, as well as possible uncertainties in the theoretical estimation of _N_(\(E_{F}\)), may contributed to the observed small difference. We feel in view of this comparison justified in interpreting _kh_0 not only in the unsubstituted, but also for the substituted samples as Pauli susceptibility. When Fe or Co are substituted, we observe a large increase of the temperature-independent corrected susceptibility _kh_0.corr as shown in Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 4. It is interesting to observe that this increased temperature-independent contribution is, within experimental uncertainty, the same for Fe or Co substitution. At the maximum substitution level of 8% Fe or Co, _kh_0.corr has risen to more than twice the value of unsubstituted BISCO. This increase in _kh_0.corr is remarkable, and certainly introduced through the magnetic character of the solute, since no such enhancement is observed1 for the unmagnetic substitution Zn. We will discuss this enhancement further below in connection with the specific-heat results and the Wilson ratio.

The specific-heat data for the Fe-substituted samples are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. In Fig. 5, we show the measured specific heat as function of temperature. In order to obtain the anomalous contribution to \(C_{p}\) in the Fe-doped samples, we subtracted the specific heat of the undoped sample to obtain \(\Delta C_{p}(x) = C_{p}(x) - C_{p}(0)\). This contribution is shown in Fig. 6, expressed per mole of Fe substitution. It can be seen that the major effect of Fe substitution is an increased specific heat at low temperatures. The onset of the additional contribution is near 15 K for \(x\) = 1, 2, and 4 % Fe, and somewhat higher temperatures (~20 K) for \(x\) = 6 and 8% Fe. The extra contribution to \(C_{p}\) rises to a maximum near 7 K and falls off, eventually turning into a temperature-linear term. This behavior is clearly evident from Fig. 6. The temperature-linear term observed at low temperatures is reached near 9 K for 6 and 8 % Fe, near 5 K for 4% Fe, and near 2.5 K for 2% Fe. For the lowest concentration of Fe, _x_F=1%, the linear regime is still not fully established near 2 K. We have in all cases used the estimate given in Fig. 6 by the dotted lines as the low-temperature limit _kh_0. It is possible that in the 1% Fe case, a small but not resolved term _A_/_T_2 in the data leads to an overestimate of _kh_0 (see analysis below). These low-temperature limiting values _kh_0 are given in Table 3 and Fig. 7. It is apparent that in the Fe-doped BISCO 2212 samples, a very large linear term is observed. The linear term is not very dependent upon Fe concentration, it moves from \(g\)0 = 66 mJ/mole K2 for \(x\) = 1% to \(x\) = 73.6 mJ/mole K2 for \(x\) = 8%, but for the higher concentrations, this value is almost independent of \(x\) with an average of _kh_0.av = 74.2 mJ/mole K2 (averaged for \(x\) = 4, 6, 8%).

The analysis of the low-temperature specific heat in terms of an anomalously large \(g\)0 is relatively straightforward for _x_F=4, 6, and 8%. For _x_F=1 and 2%, however, it is possible that the rise in _C__p_/_T_ observed at low temperatures may be partially due to the well-known low-temperature upturn observed in many high-temperature superconductors, including Co-doped BISCO.1 We have, therefore, attempted to fit the specific heat for these two Fe concentrations below 10 K to the form

\[C_{p} = \frac{A}{T^{2}} + \gamma_{0}T + \beta T^{3} + mC_{E}(T),\]

where _A_/_T_2 describes a possible low-temperature system due to Schottky anomalies, _bT_3 is the lattice term and \(C_{E}\)(_T_) an Einstein contribution. For _x_Fc=2%, we were not able to make such a fit with reasonable parameters, in fact, \(A\) turns out to be negative. In the _x_Fc=1% case, we can obtain a fit, but with an unreasonably large \(A\) (_A_ = 369 mJ K/mole). This is much larger than values of \(A\) typically observed. For Co-doped BISCO, we find that \(A\) is typically in the range 20 to 50 mJ K/mole, with one exceptionally large \(A\) = 210 mJ K/mole. Moreover, the fit in the range 2 to 4 K is not good, the

  measured \(C_{p}/T\) rises much faster than a term \(A/T^{2}\) would suggest. It is, therefore, unlikely that the major part of this effect is due to a Schottky-type \(A/T^{2}\) term. It is, however, possible that a small contribution of this type is present, but its value cannot be reliably estimated.

As can be seen from Fig. 5, any possible linear term in \(C_{p}\) is either absent, or quite small in unsubstituted BISCO, as well as Zn-doped BISCO.[1] This is in agreement with other work.[6] and makes the detection of substitution-induced linear terms comparatively easy in this system. In recent work[7] on the specific heat of a single crystal of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8, a small \(\gamma\) near 2.1 mJ/mole K2 was obtained from analysis in the range 1.5\(-\)4.5 K. This term could possibly arise from CuO2 plane disorder; it is, however, still an order of magnitude below the enhancement found in both Fe- and Co-substituted BISCO.

We have also estimated the entropy content of the anomalous specific-heat contribution. It was obtained by numerically integrating

\[\Delta S = \int_{0}^{T_{\rm max}}\frac{\Delta C_{p}}{T}\;dT,\]

where \(\Delta C_{p} = C_{p}(x_{\rm Fe}) - C_{p}(0)\), and the upper limit is the onset temperature \(T_{\rm max}\) of the anomalous contribution near 15 K. The low-temperature contribution, below about 2 K, is calculated by assuming a linear behavior to the lowest temperatures, as indicated in Fig. 6. The results are given in Table 3. We find that the entropy content per mole Fe is strongly concentration dependent. If one expresses \(\Delta S\) as \(\Delta S\) = \(R\) ln(2\(S\) + 1), then we find in the limit of low concentrations, that \(S\) falls between \(S\) = 2 and \(S\) = 3, as shown in Fig. 8. A more accurate determination is not possible due to the large contributions from the extrapolated regions below 2 K. The rather large value of \(\Delta S\) found for \(x = 1\)% Fe is more uncertain than those for the higher Fe concentrations due to the large required extrapolation to \(T = 0\) (about 35%), as well as uncertainties in the exact level of Fe concentration. The range of possible \(S\) values in the limit of low concentration is, however, certainly in agreement with the \({}^{5}D_{4}\) state suggested by the normal-state susceptibility.

Comparison of the present system with Fe-doped pure Cu, suggests that the spectroscopic state of Fe is different in that system. In Cu-Fe one also finds an additional specific-heat term,[8], its entropy content has been obtained by Triplett and Phillips[9] as \(\Delta S = R\) ln 4, giving \(S = 3/2\). This spin value is also in agreement with the susceptibility of Cu-Fe measured by Hurd[10] (\(p_{\rm eff}\)=3.68) and by Tholence and Tournier[11] (\(p_{\rm eff}\)=3.4). It appears, therefore, that Fe substitutes in BISCO in a higher spin state, than in pure copper and that this state is closer to the free-ion value. The large dependence of \(\Delta S\) on Fe concentration shows that complete disorder of Fe spins at high temperatures is obtained only at quite low concentrations, somewhat below 2%.

The temperature-independent term of the specific heat and the Pauli susceptibility in metallic systems can be compared

  by using the Wilson ratio defined as \(R\) = _kh_0/_g_0. In here both _kh_0 and \(g\)0 are to be taken in the low-temperature limit. For an ideal Fermi system, one has

\[R_{\text{ideal}} = \frac{3}{\pi^{2}}\left( \frac{\mu_{B}}{k_{B}} \right)^{2},\]

where \(m_{B}\) is the Bohr magneton. Experimentally obtained Wilson ratios are usually reported in reduced form, _R_norm = _R_/_R_ideal. In the present case we take \(g\)0 as the low-temperature limiting value of \(g\), but _kh_0 has to be obtained from measurements above \(T_{c}\). Wilson ratios obtained in this way are given in Tables III and IV and shown in Fig. 9. For Co-substituted BISCO we have a normalized Wilson ratio very close to 2 (with the exception of the 4% Co case, where we found a somewhat larger _g_). As was shown earlier (Fig. 4), _kh_corr changes between about 3 x 10-4 emu/mole to about 6.5 x 10-4 emu/mole over the range 0-8 % of Co or Fe substitution, i.e., more than a factor 2. In spite of this, the Wilson ratio for Co substitution remains near 2. This shows that the enhancement of _kh_0.corr and of \(g\)0 in this case are probably due to the same cause. It was shown by Maeda _et al._2 that Co or Fe doping of BISCO 2212 leave the carrier concentration almost unchanged (doping independent Hall coefficient). It is therefore likely that this enhancement is due to an increase in effective mass, approximately by a factor 2 for the substitution range 0-8 %, for these two systems. Co- and Fe-doped BISCO is therefore in some respect similar to the incipient Mott insulator Sr1-_x_La_Sr_TiO3 investigated by Tokura and co-workers.12,13 These authors find that in their system the metal-insulator transition is characterized by a critical effective-mass enhancement, but a constant carrier density. These authors also find a Wilson ratio near _R_norm = 2 and analyze it in terms of Fermi-liquid theory. Here

\[R_{\text{norm}} = (1 + F_{0}^{a} )^{- 1},\]

where \(F_{0}\) is one of the Landau parameters describing the Fermi liquid. A Wilson ratio of _R_norm = 2 gives \(F_{0}\) = - 0.5, and this value is approximately independent of doping level.

  The slight increase in \(R_{\rm norm}\) seen in Fig. 9 is probably still within experimental uncertainty. For \(R_{\rm norm}\)=2.5, which is close to the Wilson ratio for \(x\) = 8%, we find \(F_{0}^{\,a}\) = \(-\)0.6, this should define the range of possible values of \(F_{0}^{\,a}\).

A value of \(R_{\rm norm}\)=2 is also predicted for \(S\) =1/2 Kondo systems.[14, 15] Reviews of \(R_{\rm norm}\) for intermetallic systems have also been given,[16, 17] values close to 1 or slightly larger are usually found.

Our interpretation of the data for Co-doped BISCO is then that the normal-state Pauli susceptibility is enhanced due to effective-mass enhancement. Magnetic pair breaking in the superconducting state introduces a linear specific heat term \(\gamma\) which is essentially the normal state \(\gamma\) and which shows the same effective-mass enhancement with Co doping. For the undoped case we have \(\chi_{\rm 0,corr}\)=3.05\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) emu/mole. Using a Wilson ratio of \(R_{\rm norm}\)=2 for this case, we would estimate a \(\gamma_{0}\) of 11 mJ/mole K\({}^{2}\) for unsubstituted BISCO 2212. This \(\gamma_{0}\) cannot be directly observed due to the opening of the gap but it can be estimated from other data. For this we can, e.g., use the observed anomaly in \(C_{p}\) at \(T_{c}\). A detailed analysis of this was given by Braun _et al._,[18] who analyzed a variety of observed \(\Delta\)\(C_{p}\) in BISCO 2212 in terms of fluctuation contributions and a "BCS" linear term \(\gamma\) in \(C_{p}\), assumed to extend to \(T_{c}\). They find values of \(\gamma_{\rm BCS}\) between 2.8 and 10.9 mJ/mole K\({}^{2}\). These estimates are based on the ideal BCS ratio \(\Delta\)\(C_{p}\)/(\(\gamma_{\rm BCS}\)\(T_{c}\))=1.43. Since \(\Delta\)\(C\) is the fitted parameter, a ratio larger than 1.43 would decrease the "experimental" \(\gamma_{\rm BCS}\). In spite of the difficulties of estimating the correct \(\gamma_{0}\) for the undoped case, it is likely that \(R_{\rm norm}\) close to 2 holds also for this case.

For Fe-doped BISCO we find in the normal state similar behavior to the Co-doped system. The increase in \(\chi_{\rm 0,corr}\) with doping is the same as for Co doping and we interpret this again as due to an approximate twofold increase in effective mass over the doping range. The low-temperature behavior is, however, quite different. Here the normalized Wilson ratio varies between 0.39 and 0.67, with an average value of 0.49. This much smaller Wilson ratio is entirely due to the approximately fourfold increase in the low-temperature limiting term of \(\gamma\) compared to Co-doped BISCO. These large values are anomalous and cannot be explained simply by the recovery of the normal-state density by doping due to gapless behavior. One should, of course, also use the limiting low-temperature value of the susceptibility for calculations of the Wilson ratio. This is not possible since \(\chi_{\rm normal}\) cannot be obtained in the superconducting state. We therefore can also not extrapolate the Wilson ratio in this case to the undoped limited. We have, therefore, only the specific-heat data as indicators of anomalous behavior at low temperatures.

Since the large increase in \(\gamma_{0}\) is related to the magnetic Fe substitution, it is also instructive to present the effect in terms of the molar Fe content. This is done in Table 3 and shown in Fig. 10. As one can see, the low-temperature limiting term \(\gamma_{0}\) in terms of Fe content is enormous, and reminiscent of heavy fermion behavior. In fact for the 1% Fe BISCO sample, the linear specific-heat term per magnetic ion is only exceeded by that found[19] in CePt\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\) (\(\gamma_{0}\)=10 000 mJ/g atom K\({}^{2}\)). Another similarity between these results and heavy fermion systems is the temperature dependence of the linear term, as shown in Fig. 6.

The main result of this work is the large enhancement of the specific heat below about 15 K in Fe-doped BISCO, leading at low temperatures to a large linear term. This linear term is much larger than can be reasonably expected from the normal-state properties and it is also much larger than the linear term found in Co-doped BISCO. Similar large enhancements of the specific heat have been found previously in two other doped cuprate superconductors, (Y\({}_{1-x}\)Pr)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) (Refs. 20-23) and (Y\({}_{1-x}\)Tb\({}_{x}\))Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\).[24] Maple _et al._[20] and Jin _et al._[23] analyzed their data in terms of a Kondo anomaly. Phillips and co-workers[21, 22] describe the anomalous contribution in the Pr-doped Y-Ba-Cu-O as heavy fermion like. For a concentration of 30% Pr they find an onset of the anomaly near 50 K and a low-temperature linear term \(\gamma_{0}\) of 200 mJ/mole Pr K\({}^{2}\), or 63 mJ/mole K\({}^{2}\) (1 mole=1 formula unit). Cao _et al._[24] find (by fitting in the range 4\(-\)10 K) a \(\gamma\) of 180 mJ/mole Tb K\({}^{2}\) or 58 mJ/mole K\({}^{2}\) for Tb-doped Y-Ba-Cu-O with 37% Tb. These results are quite similar to those reported here for Fe-doped BISCO. In both of the doped Y-Ba-Cu-O system it is assumed that the 4\(f\) electrons hybridize with the mobile carriers, leading to heavy fermion behavior similar to other heavy fermion systems. The difference between these results and ours is that we have a 3\(d\) substitution and that the enhancement of \(\gamma\) per mole of magnetic substitution is much larger. Hybridization between 3\(d\) electrons and the planar carriers in BISCO is therefore much stronger. It is, however, not clear whether the normalization to magnetic ion content is the best way of looking at the data. It is indeed remarkable that the enhanced \(\gamma\) per formula unit (and therefore also per CuO\({}_{2}\) plane) is remarkably similar in all three systems (63 mJ/mole K\({}^{2}\) in Pr-doped Y-Ba-Cu-O, 58 mJ/mole K\({}^{2}\) in Tb-doped Y-Ba-Cu-O and about 72 mJ/mole K\({}^{2}\) in Fe-doped BISCO). Since we have two planes per formula unit in each of these systems, we find an enhanced \(\gamma\) of about 30 to 35

  mJ/Cu plane K2 in all of these systems. A reason for this similar behavior is not known.

A second important result arises from the comparison between Co-and Fe-doped BISCO. The Co results can, as has been shown, be understood as due to magnetic pair breaking and recovery of the normal state g. This normal state g is enhanced due to an increase in effective mass similar to the mass enhancement found in the normal state from kh0,corr. For Fe-doped BISCO a very large additional enhancement of g is observed which is similar to heavy fermion systems. A possible explanation of this difference may lie in the different wave function of Fe and Co substitution. As we have shown, the normal-state susceptibility makes it likely that Fe substitutes in a \(D\) state and Co in a \(F\) state. If this symmetry is maintained in the octahedral crystal environment, then the Fe wave function will more readily hybridize with the oxygen orbitals than the Co wave function. We are at present not aware of any other possibility of explaining the difference between Fe and Co substitution.

The main picture that evolves then is that the magnetic substitutions Co and Fe in BISCO 2212 increase the effective mass of carriers in the normal state by approximately a factor of 2 over the doping range 0 to 8%. The magnetic ions act as pair breakers. The linear specific heat in the Co-doped systems is close to the expected normal-state linear term with the same effective-mass enhancement. For Fe-doped BISCO pair breaking again produces a linear specific heat at low temperatures but this term is anomalously enhanced and heavy fermion like. The difference in behavior may be due to the different magnetic state in which Co and Fe substitute in BISCO 2212.

It is interesting to note in this context that only magnetic substitutions produce this effect in BISCO. The substitution of Zn, which is unmagnetic in BISCO, does not introduce gaplessness (at least it does not introduce a linear term in the specific heat). We believe that this result is not expected in \(d\)-wave scenarios of high-\(T_{c}\) superconductivity where both magnetic and nonmagnetic substitutions should have similar effects.
