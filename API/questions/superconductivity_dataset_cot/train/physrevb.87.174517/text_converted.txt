###### Abstract

We have performed ⁷⁵As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Knight shift
measurements on single crystals of NaFe_(0.975)Co_(0.025)As to show that
its superconductivity is a spin-paired, singlet state consistent with
predictions of the weak-coupling BCS theory. We use a spectator nucleus,
²³Na, uncoupled from the superconducting condensate, to determine the
diamagnetic magnetization and to correct for its effect on the ⁷⁵As NMR
spectra. The resulting temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility
follows the Yosida function as predicted by BCS for an isotropic,
single-valued energy gap. Additionally, we have analyzed the ²³Na
spectra that become significantly broadened by vortices to obtain the
superconducting penetration depth as a function of temperature with
λ_(ab)(0) = 5327 ± 78 A.

## I Introduction

There have been many remarkable discoveries of superconducting compounds
that are almost antiferromagnetic. Some have unconventional broken
symmetries with very high transition temperature like the cuprates or
with multiple vortex phases like the heavy fermion compound UPt₃.[1] The
recently discovered iron-pnictide family is in a new class which appears
to be conventional but with an interplay with magnetism that is not well
understood. An important question in all of these cases is whether an
appropriate theoretical starting point is the classic work of Bardeen,
Cooper, and Schrieffer[2] (BCS) where electrons conventionally form
Cooper pairs of opposite spin and angular momenta, weakly coupled
together. Unconventional Cooper pairing was first found in liquid ³He[3]
where attraction between fermions originates from spin-fluctuations in a
nearly-magnetic Fermi liquid, a rather different mechanism for
superconductivity than proposed by BCS. Nonetheless, it is important to
keep in mind that the BCS weak-coupling framework accurately accounts
for the thermodynamics of this superfluid including its spin
susceptibility. The proximity of superconductivity and
antiferromagnetism in pnictide materials is similarly suggestive, but a
comparison to BCS theory has not yet been established. These
superconductors are inherently multiband with different pairing
strengths and energy gaps on hole and electron portions of their Fermi
surface, complicating the interpretation of experiments.

However, for one of the pnictide family, NaFe_(1 − x)Co_(x)As,
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES),[4, 5]x = 0.050, and
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements,[6, 7,
8]x = 0.025, 0.050, indicate that it has a single energy gap or two gaps
of the same size. In this case a thermodynamic analysis of the
temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility is straightforward. We
have performed ⁷⁵As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Knight shift
measurements of the spin susceptibility on clean crystals of
NaFe_(0.975)Co_(0.025)As (NaCo25) to show that opposite spins pair in a
singlet state, quantitatively following the temperature dependence
expected from the weak-coupling BCS theory expressed by the Yosida
function. An essential step in our procedure to extract the spin part of
the Knight shift is to measure the local diamagnetic fields from ²³Na
NMR and subtract them from the ⁷⁵As spectra.

## II Experimental Methods

Our ⁷⁵As and ²³Na NMR experiments were performed at Northwestern
University from 4.2 K to room temperature with external magnetic field
H = 6.4 T parallel to the c axis. Because of the high reactivity of Na
we used an environmentally sealed sample holder, Fig. 1(a), made out of
glass or Stycast 1266(r). The containers were filled with helium in an
oxygen free chamber to prevent sample degradation and to exchange heat.
Degradation can be identified over time from an increase in the NMR
linewidth and consequently several different crystals were used. In the
work we report here, both nuclei exhibited very narrow NMR spectra at
room temperature: 8 kHz for ⁷⁵As, and 3 kHz for ²³Na. Crystals with
dimensions  ∼ 3 × 2 × 0.3 mm³ were grown at the University of Tennessee
and found to have T_(c) of 21 K from magnetization with H = 10 G
parallel to the ab plane; see Fig. 1(b). Spin-echo sequences (π/2-π)
were used to obtain spectra, Knight shift, and spin-lattice relaxation
rate, 1/T₁, from the central transition (−1/2 ≈ 1/2) with a π pulse ≈8
μs. The spin-spin relaxation time, T₂, was measured with a
Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence and T₁ was obtained with a
saturation recovery method for T₁ < 2 s. For longer T₁ the more
efficient progressive saturation technique[9] was used.

## III Results and Discussion

The ⁷⁵As and ²³Na NMR spectra are shown in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d). From
room temperature to just above the transition temperature, T_(c) = 18 K
in 6.4 T, the linewidths of the spectra are very narrow, less than 10
kHz, and have very weak dependence on temperature, a clear indication of
high crystal quality. On cooling from high temperatures in the normal
state, both ⁷⁵As and ²³Na spectra shift to lower frequency as has been
observed in other pnictide superconductors.[10, 11, 12] The
superconducting transition at T_(c) is evident in an abrupt decrease in
the peak frequency of the spectra; see Fig. 2. Formation of the vortex
lattice generates an inhomogeneous distribution of local fields,
broadening both spectra in the superconducting state.

The measured NMR frequency shift, Δω(T), relative to the Larmor
frequency, Δω(T)/ω_(L) = [ω(T) − ω_(L)]/ω_(L), can be expressed as

K(T) = K_(s)(T) + K_(orb) + K_(Q) + 4π(1 − D)M(T)/H,
(1)

generically referred to as the Knight shift, ⁷⁵K and ²³K for each
nucleus, determined from the peak positions of the spectra in Fig. 2.
The Knight shift has electron spin K_(s), orbital K_(orb), quadrupolar
K_(Q), and K_(dia) terms, the latter from the superconducting
diamagnetism M(T) with demagnetization factor D; K_(orb) and K_(Q)
provide a temperature-independent offset. In the normal state the
temperature dependence comes from K_(s)(T) = χ_(s)(T)A_(hf), given by
the spin susceptibility χ_(s)(T) and its corresponding hyperfine
coupling A_(hf). For T > 100 K the different temperature dependence of
⁷⁵K and ²³K is due to a much smaller hyperfine field for Na as compared
to As, which we estimate to be ⁷⁵A_(hf)/²³A_(hf) ≈ 19. For T < 100 K the
comparison of ²³K with ⁷⁵K indicates ²³K_(s) is negligible and
²³K_(orb)+²³K_(Q) = 0.0033%. The decrease of ²³K in the superconducting
state is due entirely to K_(dia)(T) and provides an internal measure of
the local field that can be subtracted from ⁷⁵K to give a precise
determination of the spin shift ⁷⁵K_(s)(T < T_(c)), Fig. 2(b),
proportional to the spin susceptibility.

Based on ARPES [4, 5] and STM [6, 7, 8] experiments we infer that there
is a single isotropic superconducting energy gap in NaCo25. Even though
the sizes of the superconducting gaps from different ARPES measurements
in NaFe_(0.95)Co_(0.05)As (NaCo50) are different, they are consistent in
two ways: the energy gaps in NaCo50 are isotropic, and the sizes of the
gaps on the electron and hole Fermi surfaces are almost identical. [4,
5] Consequently, we fit the temperature dependence of ⁷⁵K_(s) to an
isotropic Yosida function Y(T), [13] Eq. (2), to determine the energy
gap Δ(T). Allowing for strong coupling, we take Δ(T) to be scaled [14]
by a factor α from the weak-coupling BCS energy gap Δ₀(T), represented
in Eq. (3) by a convenient analytical form, [15] and then we fit the
measured Knight shift to determine α and hence Δ(T).

For T < T_(c),

$$\frac{K_{s}(T)}{K_{s}(T_{c})}=Y(T)=1-2\pi k_{B}T\sum_{n=0}^{\infty }\frac{\Delta(T)^{2}}{\left[\epsilon_{n}^{2}+\Delta(T)^{2}\right]^{3/2}},$$
(2)
Δ(T) = α Δ₀(T),
(3)
$$\Delta_{0}(T)=\Delta_{0}(0)\tanh\left(\frac{k_{B}T_{c}\pi}{ \Delta_{0}(0)}\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{T_{c}}{T}-1\right)\frac{\Delta C}{ C}\right|_{0}}\right),$$
(4)

where ϵ_(n) = 2π(n + 1/2)k_(B)T[16] and
$\frac{\Delta C}{C}|_{  We also report our measurements of spin-lattice relaxation rates for both \({}^{75}$As
and ²³Na NMR and the evidence they provide for spin fluctuations in the
normal and superconducting states. Importantly, the comparison between
the rates for the two nuclei confirms the relative magnitude of the
hyperfine fields we deduced from Knight shifts at high temperatures.
This supports our claim that ²³Na is largely uncoupled from
superconductivity and can serve as a spectator nucleus for the
measurement of diamagnetic local fields.

In contrast to the Knight shift (ω ≈ 0, q ≈ 0) the spin-lattice
relaxation is determined by the sum over wave vectors q of the imaginary
part of the dynamic susceptibility, which is coupled to the nucleus
through the square of the hyperfine field given by the form factor F(q),

$$1/T_{1}T\propto\gamma^{2}\sum_{\mathbf{q}}F(\mathbf{q})\frac{\text{Im}[\chi_{ \perp}(\mathbf{q},\omega)]}{\hbar\omega},$$
(5)

where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, F(q) is the form factor, Im [χ_(⊥)]
is the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility perpendicular to the
field.

We have found different behavior for 1/⁷⁵T₁T and 1/²³T₁T; see Fig. 3. In
the normal state, 1/⁷⁵T₁T increases with

width at half maximum (FWHM), of the ⁷⁵As and ²³Na central transition,
and the spin-spin relaxation time, T₂. The narrow linewidths at T = 20 K
from ⁷⁵As (10 kHz) and ²³Na (3 kHz) and the weak temperature dependences
indicate high crystal quality. Below T_(c) the linewidth increases in
the inhomogeneous vortex state and becomes constant below  ≈ 13 K for
⁷⁵As (12 K for ²³Na).

3.0 ± 0.3 meV, consistent with Knight shift data.

Figure 3: (Color online) The spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by
temperature, 1/T₁T, from ⁷⁵As and ²³Na. The increase of 1/⁷⁵T₁T (blue
circles) on cooling in the normal state is due to spin fluctuations
(Ref. [12]), and drops for T < T_(c) with the onset of
superconductivity. Despite the small hyperfine field, 1/²³T₁T has a
similar behavior near T_(c) (red circles). Scaling the rates by the
square of the ratio of the hyperfine fields and their respective
gyromagnetic ratios gives the open green triangles for the expected
contribution at the Na site. What remains is a second component of
relaxation (red dashed curve) of unknown origin.

decreasing temperature approaching T_(c) and can be understood in terms
of spin fluctuations [11, 12, 17, 18] expressed in terms of the Moriya
theory, [19] Eq. (5). The increase is suppressed with the onset of
superconductivity, so that 1/⁷⁵T₁T drops dramatically below T_(c),
apparently strongly dependent on the density of normal quasiparticle
excitations. For Na we find that 1/²³T₁T has a component that mimics
this behavior and can be accounted for by the weak hyperfine coupling
strength ²³Λ_(hf). Scaling the rates by the square of the ratio of the
hyperfine fields and their respective gyromagnetic ratios gives the open
green triangles in Fig. 3. Subtracting this spin-fluctuation component
of 1/²³T₁T leaves a second contribution represented by the dashed red
curve. We speculate that the spin fluctuations come from
${\bf q}\approx(\pi,0)$ or (0, π) and that the remaining contribution
might be from ${\bf q}\approx(0,0)$ not significantly affected by
superconductivity, but of unknown origin.

We next turn our discussion to the diamagnetism and vortex supercurrents
in the superconducting state. The linewidths of the central transitions
of ⁷⁵As and ²³Na are shown in Fig. 4. Below T_(c) the linewidths from
both samples broaden due to vortices and approach a constant at low
temperature approximately at the minimum in ⁷⁵T₂, which we identify with
the formation of a robust vortex solid. In our earlier work on Co doped
Ba(Fe_(0.926)Co_(0.074))₂As [10] we have associated a minimum T₂ with
the irreversibility temperature where vortices become pinned. Although
²³Na NMR is not as effective as ⁷⁵As NMR for probing the electronic
excitations, it nonetheless provides a higher resolution tool for
analysis of the spectrum in the superconducting state which is affected
by vortices and from which we can determine the penetration depth
λ_(ab). The comparisons between the superconducting state spectra and
the normal state spectra in Fig. 5 indicate an increase in the
high-frequency portion of the spectrum as expected in a vortex solid. We
have solved the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equations in an ideal vortex
lattice using Brandt’s algorithm, [21] where we set H_(c2) = 36 T. [22]
The resulting best fit distribution of local fields for ²³Na at T = 4.2
K is presented in Fig. 5(c). The fit was performed by convoluting the GL
solution from the algorithm with the normal state (T = 20 K) spectrum,
minimizing its difference from the experimental spectra using the
penetration depth as an adjustable parameter. We have analyzed λ_(ab)(T)
using a BCS formula in the low-temperature limit,
$\lambda(T)=\lambda(0)[1+\sqrt{\frac{1}{2\sigma^{2}}}\exp(-\frac{1}{\sigma_{B}T})]$.
[23] For ²⁵As we find λ_(ab)(0) to be 4780 A and from ²³Na,
λ_(ab)(0) = 5327 A, which can be compared with μSR, [20]λ_(ab)(0) = 4260
A. The penetration depth from the ²³Na is more reliable since the
temperature-dependent spin shift is negligible. From the fit of the
temperature dependent penetration depth to the BCS formula and Eqs. (3)
and (4) we found the superconducting gap size 3.0 ± 0.4 meV, close to
the value from the Knight shift, supporting the view that NaCo25
superconductivity is close to weak coupling.

## IV Conclusion

In summary, we have found evidence for weak-coupling superconductivity
from the temperature dependence of the Knight shift and the penetration
depth in NaCo25 consistent with BCS theory. The superconducting gap size
taken from the Knight shift is 3.6 ± 0.3 meV and 3.0 ± 0.4 meV from the
penetration depth. From the Knight shift we have
2Δ/k_(B)T_(c) = 4.0 ± 0.3 close to the weak-coupling BCS limit of 3.53.
From Ginzburg-Landau theory we find a zero-temperature penetration depth
of λ_(ab)(0) = 5327 ± 78 A.
