###### Abstract

_T_c and _dT_c/_dP_ have been systematically measured for fully oxygenated _R_Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ (_R_-123) with \(R\) = Yb, Tm, Ho, Dy, Gd, Sm, and Nd. _T_c has been observed to increase from 88 to 94 K with increasing radius of the \(R\) ion (_r_) from 0.98 to 1.12 A. Based on the lattice strains and our _dT_c/_dP_ data, we have calculated _T_c for the series of _R_-123 and compared them with the measured _T_c. Good agreement between the experimental and the calculated results strongly suggests that the \(R\) effect on _T_c in _R_-123 originates from the strain-induced charge redistribution between the charge reservoir and the CuO2 plane.

While the microscopic mechanism of high-temperature superconductors (HTS) is still elusive, the electronic structure of relevant cuprates has been characterized by a phase-diagram of temperature (_T_) and the carrier concentration (_n_).1 This _T_-_n_ diagram shows that the superconductivity occurs in a certain range of \(n\), and the superconducting transition temperature (_T_c) is approximately a parabolic function of \(n\). From the structural point of view, it is widely believed that the CuO2 plane is the principal site for the superconducting activity, and the metal oxide (i.e., _M_O, where \(M\) is Cu, La, Hg, Tl, or Bi serves as a charge reservoir to supply carriers into the CuO2 plane. Other structural components such as rare-earth and alkaline elements work as counter cations to stabilize the structure. However, some evidences2-4 have shown that the influence of rare-earth elements (_R_) on _T_c should not be ignored. For YBa2Cu3O7 (Y-123), it was demonstrated that the substitution of some magnetic \(R\) ions have no significant effect on _T_c,5 thus leading to an assumption that the \(R\) site in the _R_-123 structure was electronically isolated from conduction electrons. Although a _T_c variation in the series of oxygenated _R_-123 had been noticed by Neumeier,6 the relatively large scattering in the values of _T_c made a quantitative analysis difficult. Later, the work by Fernandes _et al.7_ with a good control of sample quality showed that the _T_c value for fully oxygenated Gd1-_x_Y_xBa2Cu3O7 decreased linearly with increasing \(x\). This result confirmed a significant \(R\) effect on _T_c in _R_-123. Very recently, Ramesh and Hedge8 reported that, based on a calculation of the bond-valence sums for _R_-123, the valence of the in-plane copper Cu(2) increases with decreasing radius of the \(R\) ion (_r_), implying an increase of carrier concentration in the CuO2 plane with decreasing \(r\). Then, the combination of the experimental results of Fernandes _et al._ and the calculation of Ramesh and Hedge gives rise to a conclusion that _T_c can be lower when \(n\) is higher in the series of _R_-123. This conclusion contradicts with the general belief that _T_c should increase with increasing carrier concentration and raises an interesting issue regarding the relationship between _T_c and \(n\) in these materials. We therefore have performed a systematic measurement of _T_c and pressure effect of _T_c for a series of fully-oxygenated _R_-123 samples with an attempt to delineate the implication of the \(R\) effect on _T_c.

In this work, polycrystalline _R_Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ with \(R\) = Yb, Tm, Ho, Dy, Gd, Sm, and Nd were prepared by the standard solid-state reaction technique. The oxygen contents of fully oxygenated samples were determined by the idemotric titration method to be 6.97 +- 0.03 for all samples. X-ray powder diffraction was employed to confirm the phase purity of the samples, and the Meissner effect at field cooling was measured to check their homogeneity. The sample was individually sealed in a Teflon cell with 3M Florinert fluid as pressure medium and the cell was contained in a Be-Cu high-pressure bomb to generate hydrostatic pressure, \(P\), up to 1.8 GPa. The standard four-point method was employed for resistivity measurements. _T_c was defined as the temperature at which the electrical resistivity drops to 50% of its extrapolated normal-state value; the transition width (D_T_c) was defined as the temperature difference between 100% and 0% in the extrapolated normal-state resistivity values (_T_0 and _T_f, respectively). Since the pressure effect of _T_c depends critically on the sample quality,9 and is reliable only when both the resistive and magnetic transition are sharp, we have also measured _T_c with the diamagnetic transition for comparison. For a typical sample used in this work, the resistive _T_c agrees with magnetic _T_c within 2 K. The value of D_T_c is <1 K determined resistively and <3 K determined magnetically for all measured _R_-123 samples except Yb-123. For Yb-123, we have found that D_T_c~2 K resistively and ~5 K magnetically.

Figure 1 displays _T_c as a function of \(r\), with the attached bars representing the resistive transition widths. It indicates a _T_c increase from 87.9 to 94.4 K with increasing \(r\) from 0.98 to 1.12 A. In Fig. 1, the open bar refers the _T_c of Y-123 obtained by Neumeier and Zimmermann.10 Figure 2 shows the _r_(_T_) curves for a typical _R_-123 sample (Gd-123) at vari ous pressures. For all measured \(R\)-123, the normal state \(\rho\) is decreased by the application of pressure, and the \(d\) ln\(\rho\)/\(dP\) at normal state is found to be 10\(\pm\) 2 %/Gpa which is consistent with the previous reports for most of HTS.[11] Figure 3 demonstrates \(T_{c}\) vs \(P\) for \(R\) from Nd to Yb. We have fitted the data to the straight lines by the law of least square. As shown in Fig. 3, there is a gradual decrease of the slope (\(dT_{c}/dP\)) from 1.21 K/Gpa for Nd-123 to \(-\)0.51 K/Gpa for Yb-123. In this figure, two sets of data for the sample of Yb-123 are presented. The data marked as Yb-123* is for the \(T_{0}\) defined as the onset of the resistive transition, giving \(dT_{0}/dP\) = \(-\) 0.01 K/Gpa. The other is for the \(T_{c}\) defined as the midpoint of the resistive transition, yielding \(dT_{c}/dP\) = \(-\) 0.51 K/GPa (note that \(dT_{0}/dP\) is in agreement with \(dT_{c}/dP\) within the experimental errors for other measured R-123). The discrepancy between \(dT_{0}/dP\) and \(dT_{c}/dP\) for Yb-123 indicates a broadening of \(\Delta T_{c}\) under pressure. A possible explanation for this broadening of \(\Delta T_{c}\) is the existence of a second phase which is less than 5% of total mass such that x-ray-diffraction patterns could not reflect it. In such case, \(dT_{c}/dP\) represents the pressure effect on \(T_{c}\) for the major phase of this sample, while \(dT_{0}/dP\) is attributable to the phase with the higher \(T_{c}\) . Both \(dT_{c}/dP\) and \(dT_{0}/dP\) are negative, which may be regarded as a general property of a well-overdoped material as those demonstrated previously in the high-pressure studies of (Y,La,Ca)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\).[10] To display clearly the \(R\) dependence of \(dT_{c}/dP\), we plot \(dT_{c}/dP\) vs \(r\) for various \(R\)-123 in Fig. 4, with the associated solid bars giving the experimental uncertainties and the open bar referring the data of Y-123 taken by Neumeier and Zimmermann.[10] It indicates that \(dT_{c}/dP\) increases with increasing \(r\), in a similar fashion of \(T_{c}\) vs \(r\)

  (as shown in Fig. 1). This similarity implies a close correlation between \(dT_{c}/dP\) and \(T_{c}\) .

Based on a change in lattice parameters due to the \(R\) substitution in \(R\)-123,[12] the effect of lattice expansion (for larger \(R\)) or lattice contraction (for smaller \(R\)) should play an important role in the \(T_{c}\) variation. In principle, the change of the lattice parameters may induce a strain in the unit cell, and a lattice strain can be simulated by the application of external pressure along three crystal axes. According to the result of the uniaxial pressure effect on \(T_{c}\) for Y-123,[13] the effect of hydrostatic pressure on \(T_{c}\) is essentially a summation of the uniaxial stresses along the \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) directions. By analogy with the uniaxial pressure effect, we postulate a formula to calculate the \(T_{c}\) variation based on the changes in the lattice parameters \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) with respect to a reference material:

\[T_{c}-T_{c}^{\prime}=\frac{\partial T_{c}}{\partial\varepsilon_{1}}\frac{a-a_ {0}}{a}+\frac{\partial T_{c}}{\partial\varepsilon_{2}}\frac{b-b_{0}}{b}+ \frac{\partial T_{c}}{\partial\varepsilon_{3}}\frac{c-c_{0}}{c}\] (1)

where \(T_{c}^{\prime}\), \(a_{0}\), \(b_{0}\), and \(c_{0}\) are the \(T_{c}\) and lattice parameters for a reference material and \(\varepsilon_{1}\), \(\varepsilon_{2}\), and \(\varepsilon_{3}\) denote the strains along the \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) directions, respectively. Here \(\partial T_{c}/\partial\varepsilon_{i}\) is related to the uniaxial pressure effect \(\partial T_{c}/\partial P_{i}\) (\(j\) = 1,2,3) by

\[\frac{\partial T_{c}}{\partial\varepsilon_{i}}=-\sum_{j}\,C_{ll}\frac{ \partial T_{c}}{\partial P_{j}}\] (2)

in which \(C_{ll}\) are the components of the elastic tensor and have been determined for the untwinned Y-123 single crystal.[14] We have chosen an untwinned Y-123 single crystal as our reference material, and have calculated the relative changes of lattice parameters for other \(R\)-123 based on their lattice parameters determined from the neutron powder diffraction (NPD).[8] The results are listed in the first three columns of Table 1 with \(a_{0}\), \(b_{0}\), and \(c_{0}\) being the lattice parameters of Y-123 and equaling 3.817, 3.883, and 11.633 A, respectively. In Ref. [13], the uniaxial pressure data of the Y-123 single crystal were obtained: \(dT_{c}/dP_{a}\) = \(-\) 2.0 K/GPa, \(dT_{c}/dP_{b}\) = 1.9 K/GPa, and \(dT_{c}/dP_{c}\) = \(-\) 0.3 K/GPa, and then the values of \(\partial T_{c}/\partial\varepsilon_{1}\), \(\partial T_{c}/\partial\varepsilon_{2}\), and \(\partial T_{c}/\partial\varepsilon_{3}\) were derived as 230, \(-\)220, and 18 K, respectively. We inserted these values into Eq. (1), and obtained the \(T_{c}\) values for the series of \(R\)-123 as listed in the fifth column of Table 1. As shown in Table 1, these calculated \(T_{c}\) agree with the measured values within 1 K except for Yb-123. The discrepancy between the calculated \(T_{c}\) and the measured \(T_{c}\) for Yb-123 is understandable since the Yb-123 sample used for the NPD measurement in Ref. [8] was later found to be multiphased.

Although we have shown that the lattice strains could account for the observed \(T_{c}\) variations in \(R\)-123, further knowledge of the relationship between the lattice strains and the carrier concentration (\(n\)) is useful for understanding the mechanism of the \(T_{c}\) variations in these materials. By comparing Fig. 1 with Fig. 4, it is evident that \(T_{c}\) and \(dT_{c}/dP\) are correlated as seen from the similarity in their \(r\) dependence. In order to obtain the information of \(n\) from the measured \(dT_{c}/dP\) values, we have adopted the model of pressure induced charge transfer, in which the value of \(dT_{c}/dP\) depends on \(n\) and the pressure-induced increase in \(n\).[10] Based on an empirical \(T_{c}\)-\(n\) curve found for (Y,La,Ca)-123,[10] we first assume the following parabolic \(T_{c}(n)\) relation to hold for the whole series of \(R\)-123:

\[T_{c}=T_{c0}-A(n_{0}-n)^{2}.\] (3)

Then, the rate of increase of \(T_{c}\) with pressure is given by

\[dT_{c}/dP=dT_{c0}/dP+2A(n_{0}-n)dn/dP,\] (4)

where \(T_{c0}\) is the maximum \(T_{c}\) corresponding to an optimal carrier concentration (\(n_{0}\)), and \(dn/dP\) is the derivative of the number of carriers with pressure. The empirical values of \(dT_{c0}/dP\), \(dn/dP\), and \(A\) are positive constants. Assuming material is underdoped, i.e., \((n_{0}-n)\)\(>\)0, a larger \(dT_{c}/dP\) gives a larger \((n_{0}-n)\) in Eq. (4). According to Eq. (3), a larger \((n_{0}-n)\) corresponds to a lower \(T_{c}\) . Then, a material with a larger \(dT_{c}/dP\) should have a lower \(T_{c}\) . This is opposite to the observations in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4 where Nd-123 has the highest \(T_{c}\) (= 94.4 K) as well as the highest \(dT_{c}/dP\) (= 1.2 K/GPa). On the other hand, if one assumes material is overdoped, i.e., \((n_{0}-n)\)\(<\)0, a larger \(dT_{c}/dP\) yields a smaller \(|n_{0}-n|\) and the smaller \(|n_{0}-n|\) the higher \(T_{c}\) . This trend of \(dT_{c}/dP\) vs \(T_{c}\) is in agreement with our observations and thus implies that the series of \(R\)-123 from Nd-123 to Yb-123 is likely to lie in the overdoped region of the \(T_{c}\)-\(n\) curve. Since the empirical \(T_{c0}\) (\(\sim\)94.2 K) obtained by Neumeier and Zimmermann[10] is very close to the \(T_{c}\) of Nd-123 (= 94.4 K, the highest \(T_{c}\) among \(R\)-123), we have chosen \(dT_{c}/dP\) of Nd-123 to be \(dT_{c0}/dP\) (i.e., \(dT_{c0}/dP\) = 1.2 K/GPa). Using the values of \(A\), \(dn/dP\) from Ref. [11] (590 K/hole\({}^{2}\), and 0.01 holes/GPa, respectively) along with our measured \(dT_{c}/dP\), we have deduced \((n-n_{0})\) from Eq. (4) for various \(R\)-123. Then, by inserting these values of \((n-n_{0})\) into Eq. (3), we have found \(T_{c}\) to be 94.1, 92.1, 91.8, 89.6, and 88.2 K for Sm-, Dy-, Ho-, Tm-, and Yb-123, respectively. These calculated \(T_{c}\) again agree with the measured ones (as shown in Table 1) within 1 K. This remarkable agreement clearly demonstrates the applicability of the parabolic \(T_{c}(n)\) function in explaining the \(T_{c}\)-\(r\) relation for the series of \(R\)-123. We therefore attribute the decrease in \(T_{c}\) with decreasing \(r\) to the increase in \(n\). In addition, the variation of \(n\) must come from a charge redistribution between the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane and other structural components (serving as a charge reservoir) since the oxygen contents of these material are all 6.97\(\pm\) 0.03. Very recently, Ramesh and Hedge[8] have shown that the bond valence sum (BVS) of the in-plane copper increases with decreasing \(r\), while the BVS of the \(R\) ion decreases with decreasing \(r\) for a

  series of _R_-123. It is indicative of a strain-induced charge transfer from the \(R\) ion to the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane, resulting to an increase of \(n\) with decreasing \(r\). Therefore it is possible that the \(R\) effect on _T_\({}_{c}\) in _R_-123 originate from the strain-induced charge redistribution between the \(R\) ion and the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane.

In summary, _T_\({}_{c}\) and _dT_\({}_{c}\)/_dP_ for fully oxygenated _R_-123 with \(R\) =Yb, Tm, Y, Ho, Dy, Gd, Sm, and Nd have been systematically measured. We have observed a nearly linear \(r\) dependence of _T_\({}_{c}\) and _dT_\({}_{c}\)/_dP_, suggesting that the series of _R_-123 is likely to be in the overdoped region of the _T_\({}_{c}\)-_n_ diagram. We have calculated the _T_\({}_{c}\) values for _R_-123 based on the relative changes of their lattice parameters, and also from the measured _dT_\({}_{c}\)/_dP_ data. The agreement of the calculated _T_\({}_{c}\) with the measured _T_\({}_{c}\) strongly suggests that the origin of the observed \(R\) effect on _T_\({}_{c}\) in _R_-123 is the strain-induced charge redistribution between the charge reservoir and the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane.
