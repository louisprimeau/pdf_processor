###### Abstract

Magnetization measurements revealed that Ba_{1-x}Rb_{x}BiO_{3} exhibits superconductivity at T_{c} = 29 K in the 0.28 \leqx \leq 0.44 range. In this range the room-temperature crystal structure belongs to the cubic phase. The T_{c} value is independent of Rb concentration, although the lattice parameter decreases linearly with increasing x. Material parameters for Ba_{0.4}Rb_{0.4}BiO_{3} are derived from measurements on the lower and upper critical fields. Comparison with Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}BiO_{3} shows that physical properties of the two superconductors are practically described by the same material parameters. The Sommerfeld parameter \gamma is found to be 2.4 mJ mole^{-1}K^{-2}, which is in good agreement with the value estimated from the normal-state susceptibility.

Since the discovery of the 30-K superconductor Ba_{1-x}K_{x}BiO_{3},[1, 2] several experimental studies have been carried out in order to investigate the physical properties in this system. One of the most prominent features in the Ba_{1-x}K_{x}BiO_{3} system is the absence of magnetic order. Muon-spin-rotation[3] and magnetic-susceptibility[4, 5] measurements support the interpretation[6, 7] that the Bi(6s)-O(2p) bands in both BaBiO_{3} and Ba_{1-x}K_{x}BiO_{3} have nonmagnetic character. The situation in Ba_{1-x}K_{x}BiO_{3} is in sharp contrast to the competition between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in Cu-O-based compounds, such as La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (Ref. [8]) and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-x}.[9] The observations on oxygen-isotope effect in Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}BiO_{3} (Refs. [4] and [10]) suggest that the electron-phonon interaction plays an important role in the superconducting pairing mechanism. According to the neutron[11, 12] and x-ray diffraction[2, 13, 14] results, Ba_{1-x}K_{x}BiO_{3} for 0.25 <x < 0.45 exhibits a cubic perovskite structure both in superconducting and normal states. Based on critical-field measurements,[4, 15] Ba_{1-x}K_{x}BiO_{3} is regarded as an extreme type-II superconductor. This is similar in character to the 12-K superconductor BaPb_{0.75}Bi_{0.25}-O_{3}.[16, 17, 18] In spite of the simultaneous discovery of superconductivity in Ba_{1-x}K_{x}BiO_{3} and Ba_{1-x}Rb_{x}BiO_{3},[1, 2] we lack definite information concerning the superconducting properties of the Rb-substituted material. In this Rapid Communication, we present the superconducting range and the lattice parameter in Ba_{1-x}Rb_{x}BiO_{3} as a function of x. Furthermore, we determine both lower and upper critical fields, and normal-state susceptibility. Then we derive material parameters describing superconducting properties. We compare the present results with those for Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}BiO_{3} and BaPb_{0.75}Bi_{0.25}O_{3}.

The powder samples used in this study were prepared using the two-step procedure invented for Ba_{1-x}K_{x}BiO_{3} by Hinks _et al.[11]_ Appropriate mixtures of BaCO_{3}, Rb_{2}CO_{3}, and Bi_{2}O_{3} were calcined at 750 ^{\circ}C for 12 h in flowing N_{2} gas, pulverized, and then annealed in O_{2} at 400 ^{\circ}C for 1 h. We estimated the average grain size in the sample to be 5.5 \mum using a HORIBA centrifugal particle analyzer.

The Ba_{1-x}Rb_{x}BiO_{3} samples were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction at room temperature. For 0.28 \leqx \leq 0.44, all the observed Bragg peaks were indexed on a cubic unit cell. By the analogy of the K-substituted crystal,[13] Ba_{1-x}Rb_{x}BiO_{3} in the 0.28 <x < 0.44 range is expected to have a cubic perovskite structure with space group _Pm_ 32m. As shown in Fig. 1, lattice parameter a decreases linearly with increasing x. Similar behavior has been observed for the Ba_{1-x}K_{x}BiO_{3} system.[11] In an octahedral environment, the ionic size of K^{+} or Rb^{+} is slightly larger than that of Ba^{2+}, while the size of Bi^{3+} is considerably smaller than that of Bi^{3+}. The Rb

 or K substitution increases the apparent Bi^{5+}/Bi^{3+} ratio. Thus, the ionic-radius relation can account for the change in lattice parameter a with Rb or K concentration. The semiconducting parent-compound BaBiO_{3} has a monoclinic distorted perovskite structure consisting of two distinct Bi-O bond lengths [19]. X-ray-diffraction patterns indicate that Ba_{1-x}Rb_{x}BiO_{3} in the x<0.24 range has a lower symmetry structure related with BaBiO_{3}. For x>0.48, the RbBiO_{2} phase appears in the diffraction data. The phase relation in the present system is similar to the situation reported for the Ba_{1-x}K_{x}BiO_{3} system [11, 13, 20]. A large energy gap in BaBiO_{3} is interpreted in terms of the commensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) instability [19]. The structural phase transition in Ba_{1-x}Rb_{x}BiO_{3} from monoclinic to cubic symmetry seems to be accompanied by the suppression of the CDW.

Magnetization measurements on powder samples were performed using a commercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. The zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization was determined by warming the sample in a field of 10 Oe after cooling to 4.2 K in zero field. The field-cooled (FC) magnetization was obtained by cooling with the applied field. As indicated in Fig. 2, both ZFC and FC curves for Ba_{0.6}Rb_{0.4}BiO_{3} yield T_{c}=29 K. Schneemeyer _et al._[13] reported that the highest T_{c} value is 30.5 K in the Ba_{1-x}K_{x}BiO_{3} system. The Rb/K mass ratio may give rise to the slight difference in T_{c} between Ba_{1-x}K_{x}BiO_{3} and Ba_{1-x}Rb_{x}BiO_{3}. The FC magnetization observed in the 0.28\leq x\leq 0.44 range corresponds to 10-45% of a full Meissner effect, indicating bulk superconductivity in this material. For lower Rb-content samples the diamagnetic signal at 4.2 K decreases sharply with decreasing x. At x=0.12 the magnetization indicates 0.1% of perfect diamagnetism. This is due to concentration fluctuation in a fractional part of the sample. Thus, the present results lead to the conclusion that the superconductivity in the Ba_{1-x}Rb_{x}BiO_{3} system exists in the 0.28\leq x\leq 0.44 range, where the room-temperature crystal structure belongs to the cubic phase. A similar situation [11] has been reported for the K-substituted material. Note that in Fig. 1(b) the T_{c} values remain constant in the 0.28\leq x\leq 0.44 range. This suggests that the T_{c} value is independent of hole concentration in Ba_{1-x}Rb_{x}BiO_{3}.

The lower critical fields H_{c1}(T) were determined from the field dependence of the magnetization after cooling the sample in zero field to the desired temperature. The low-field magnetization results are plotted in Fig. 3. Here H_{c1}(T) is defined as the field where the magnetization M(H) first deviates from linearity. The H_{c1} values are 60 Oe at 10 K and 80 Oe at 5 K. We estimate H_{c1}(0)=90 Oe, on the assumption that H_{c1}(T) increases linearly with decreasing temperature. The upper critical fields H_{c2}(T) were obtained from constant-field magnetization measurements as a function of temperature. In Fig. 4, T_{c} is the temperature where the constant-field magnetization starts

  to deviate from practically temperature-independent normal-state values. The upper critical fields H_{c2}(T) are plotted in Fig. 5 as a function of temperature. The dH_{c2}/dT slope near T_{c} is found to be - 5.9 kOe/K. We evaluate H_{c2}(0)=118 kOe from the relationship H_{c2}(0)=-0.697_{c}(dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}}, based on the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory[21] for the dirty-limit type-II superconductor.

The H_{c1}(0) and H_{c2}(0) values yield superconducting material parameters. The upper critical field H_{c2}(0) is given by H_{c2}(0)=0_{0}/2\pi\xi, where \Phi_{0} is the flux quantum and \xi(0) is the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence length. Both H_{c1}(0) and H_{c2}(0) are expressed as H_{c1}(0) = H_{c}(0)\ln\kappa/\sqrt{2}\kappa, and H_{c2}(0)=\sqrt{2}H_{c}(0)\kappa, where H_{c}(0) is the thermodynamic critical field, and \kappa is the GL parameter. We can estimate the value for Sommerfeld parameter \gamma=2.4 mJ mole^{-1} K^{-2}, based on the BCS relationship \gamma=0.17H_{c}(0)/T_{c}1^{2} erg cm^{-3} K^{-2}[22]. In Table 1 the derived material parameters for Ba_{0.6}Rb_{0.4}BiO_{3} are compared with those for Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}BiO_{3} (Ref. [4]) and BaPb_{0.75}Bi_{0.23}O_{3}[17, 18]. Here we estimate H_{c2}(0) values from the dH_{c2}/dT data using the WHH equation. Superconducting properties of the Rb- and K-substituted materials are practically described by the same material parameters. Based on the BCS relationship, the difference in T_{c} between Ba_{0.6}Rb_{0.4}BiO_{3} and BaPb_{0.75}Bi_{0.25}O_{3} is partly due to the difference in the density of states near E_{F}.

Figure 6 shows normal-state susceptibility \chi values for x= 0.12, 0.28, and 0.36 as a function of temperature up to 250 K. The core diamagnetic-susceptibility \chi_{c} is estimated to be -2.23\times10^{-7} emu/g.[23] After correction for \chi_{c2}, we deduce the Pauli spin susceptibility \chi_{P}=0.73\times10^{-7} emu/g for x= 0.36 from the observed \chi value. Thus, the \chi measurements yield \gamma=2.1\pm 0.3 mJ mole^{-1} K^{-2}, which is in good agreement with the value estimated from H_{c}(0). The \gamma values for La_{1.85}Ba_{0.15}CuO_{4} (Ref. [24]) and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-x} (Ref. [25]) are reported to be 5 mJ mole^{-1}K^{-2}. It follows that the common feature of the Bi-based superconductors is the low density of states N(0) near E_{F}.

As shown in Fig. 6, there is a slight difference in \chi between x=0.12 and x=0.36. This indicates that the Rb substitution exerts little influence on N(0) near E_{F} in
