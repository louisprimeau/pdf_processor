###### Abstract

\alpha-FeSe with the PbO structure is a key member of the family of high-T_{c} iron pnictide and chalcogenide superconductors, as while it possesses the basic layered structural motif of edge-sharing distorted FeSe_{4} tetrahedra, it lacks interleaved ion spacers or charge-reservoir layers. We find that the application of hydrostatic pressure first rapidly increases T_{c} which attains a broad maximum of 37 K at \sim 7 GPa before decreasing to 6 K upon further compression to \sim14 GPa. Complementary synchrotron x-ray diffraction at 16 K was used to measure the low-temperature isothermal compressibility of \alpha-FeSe, revealing an extremely soft solid with a bulk modulus, K_{0}=30.7(1.1) GPa and strong bonding anisotropy between interlayer and intralayer directions that transforms to the more densely packed \beta polymorph above \sim9 GPa. The nonmonotonic T_{c}(P) behavior of FeSe coincides with drastic anomalies in the pressure evolution of the interlayer spacing, pointing to the key role of this structural feature in modulating the electronic properties.

## I Introduction

The \alpha polymorph of the simple binary FeSe phase has recently emerged as a superconductor with an ambient PT_{c} of \sim8-13 K.[1, 2] Its structure comprises stacks of edge-sharing FeSe_{4} tetrahedra with a packing motif essentially identical to that of the FeAs layers in the families of the FeAs-based high-T_{c} superconductors [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] but lacking any interleaved ion spacers or insulating layers. The structural analogy is reinforced by the observation that below 70 K the high-temperature crystal structure becomes orthorhombic (space group Cmma),[8] displaying an identical distortion of the FeSe layers to that observed in the iron oxyarsenide family.[9, 10] Theoretical calculations also find a very similar two-dimensional electronic structure to that of the FeAs-based superconductors with cylindrical electron sections at the Brillouin-zone corner and cylindrical hole surface sections.[11] Moreover, superconductivity in FeSe is very sensitive to defects and disorder and occurs over a limited range of FeSe_{1-\delta} nonstoichiometry.[12]

The effect of applied pressure on T_{c} provides crucial information to differentiate between competing models of superconductivity and in the FeSe binary, T_{c} is initially extremely sensitive to P and rises rapidly to 27 K at 1.48 GPa.[2] At the same time, antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations present above T_{c} are strongly enhanced by pressure.[13] In the FeAs-based superconductors, the response of T_{c} to pressure is complex and sensitively depends on the composition of the materials and their doping level. Both positive and negative initial pressure coefficients, dT_{c}/dP have been measured. Typically for the REFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} families, dT_{c}/dP is positive at low doping levels and switches over to a negative value as x increases.[14, 15, 16, 17, 18] Moreover, for systems where the initial dT_{c}/dP is positive, there is a critical value of P above which the trend is reversed and T_{c} decreases upon further pressurization.[14, 19]

Despite the importance of the evolution of T_{c} with P in understanding the superconducting properties of the Fe-based materials, there is currently little information on the detailed pressure dependence of their structural properties.[20, 21, 22] Here we report on the conducting properties of FeSe as a function of P up to \sim14 GPa; we find a very high initial pressure coefficient with T_{c} maximized at 37 K at \sim7 GPa. At higher P, dT_{c}/dP becomes negative and T_{c} is reduced to 6 K at \sim14 GPa. We also study the precise pressure evolution to 12.8 GPa of the FeSe structure at 16 K (i.e., well within the superconducting regime) by synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction. We find that the orthorhombic \alpha polymorph survives to \sim9 GPa whereupon the structure changes to that of the nonsuperconducting hexagonal \beta phase. T_{c} initially increases with P despite the decreasing SeFeSe thickness and the increasing distortion of the FeSe_{4} units while the subsequent decrease clearly correlates with changes in the FeSe interlayer spacing.

## II Experimental details

The FeSe polycrystalline sample used in this work was prepared, as reported elsewhere.[2] High resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction at ambient P is consistent with a stoichiometry Fe_{1.03}Se. Electrical resistivity measurements under high pressures were performed by a standard four-probe technique using a diamond-anvil cell (DAC). Powdered NaCl was used as pressure-transmitting medium. Pressure  was applied at room temperature and measured by the ruby fluorescence method. The measured values at low temperature are used to discuss the pressure dependence of T_{c}. The high-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction experiments at 16 K were performed at beamline BL10XU, SPring-8. The powder sample was loaded in a membrane DAC, which was placed inside a closed-cycle helium refrigerator. Daphne(tm) oil was used as a pressure medium. The applied pressure measured with the ruby fluorescence method was increased at 16 K without dismounting the cell from the cryostat. The diffraction patterns (\lambda = 0.41118 A) were collected using a flat image plate detector up to 12.8 GPa. Data analysis of the diffraction profiles was performed with the GSAS suite of Rietveld programs.

## III Results

Figure 1(a) shows the temperature dependence of the resistance of the FeSe sample at various pressures. Superconductivity was observed below 13.4 K with a fairly sharp onset (run 1). T_{c} is found to increase initially rapidly upon the application of pressure with an accompanying increase in width and reaches a broad maximum of 37 K at 6.6 GPa--for binary solids, this high T_{c} is only surpassed by Cs3C60 (38 K) (Ref. [23]) and MgB2 (39 K).[24] In a second experiment (run 2), P was increased first directly to 7.6 GPa and then to 13.9 GPa where the onset T_{c} is smaller at 6 K [Fig. 1(b)]. Pressure release to near ambient and subsequent pressurization to 9.7 GPa (run 3) resulted in smaller values of T_{c}--this may be related to the irreversibility of the \alpha \rightarrow \beta structural transformation (_vide infra_) [Fig. 3(d)].

Inspection of the diffraction profile at 16 K and 0.25 GPa [Fig. 2(a)] readily reveals the orthorhombic (O) unit cell (space group Cmma) established for \alpha-FeSe below 70 K at ambient P.[8] Additional peaks are also evident and these can be accounted for by the presence of a minority hexagonal NiAs-type \beta-FeSe phase [31.7(1)% fraction] (Table 1). The diffraction data sets collected with increasing P show no structural changes for \alpha-FeSe between 0.25 and 7.5 GPa with the \alpha/\beta-phase assemblage remaining unaltered [Fig. 2(b)]. The same structural model was therefore employed in the Rietveld refinements in this pressure range, revealing a monotonic decrease in the lattice constants and unit-cell volume with increasing P [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)]. However, the response of the lattice metrics to P is strongly anisotropic with the interlayer spacing showing a significantly larger contraction than the intralayer dimensions. As P increases, 2c/(a + b) smoothly decreases until at \sim4 GPa, it approaches 1. Further increase in P leads to an even higher compression of the FeSe interlayer spacing [Fig. 3(c)] with [2c/(a + b)] = 0.987(2) at 7.5 GPa. However, as the sample is pressed to 9.0 GPa [Fig. 2(c)], the \alpha-phase fraction begins to decrease and then it sharply collapses [inset of Fig. 2(b)]

The lower green solid lines show the difference profiles and the tick marks show the reflection positions of the \alpha-(upper) and \beta-(lower) phases, respectively. The diffraction profile collected at 12.1 GPa clearly shows the \alpha \rightarrow \beta phase transformation. The \beta phase undergoes a phase transition from hexagonal to orthorhombic at 6.0 GPa.

  with an almost complete a - b transformation taking place--at 12.1 GPa, the _a_-phase fraction is ~12% [Fig. 2(d)]. At the same time, while the basal plane lattice constants continue to contract, c begins to increase, resulting in saturation of the volume response to pressure and an increasing _2c_/(_a_ + _b_) ratio [Figs. 3(a)-3(c)]. Gradual depressurization to ~2 GPa does not lead to recovery of the orthorhombic a polymorph (its fraction remains at ~12%), implying that the a - b phase transformation is irreversible at these low temperatures. Recovery of _a_-FeSe (53% fraction) at this P necessitated heating of the sample inside the DAC to 300 K.25

The volume compressibility, \kappa=d ln V/dP=0.033(1) GPa^{-1} implies a soft highly compressible solid. A comparable value of the bulk modulus \sim33 GPa at 50 K has been proposed from neutron-diffraction measurements over a restricted 0-0.6 GPa range.[27] The anisotropy in bonding of the \alpha-FeSe structure [Fig. 4(d)] is clearly evident in Fig. 3(a) which displays the variation in the orthorhombic lattice constants with P. \alpha-FeSe is least compressible in the basal plane in which the covalent Fe-Se bonds lie (d ln a/dP =0.029(2) GPa^{-1}, d ln b/dP=0.026(3) GPa^{-1}) while the interlayer compressibility, d ln c/dP=0.065(4) GPa^{-1} is \sim2.5 times larger, implying very soft Se-Se interlayer interactions.

## IV Discussion

The immediate consequence of the structural simplicity of FeSe is that the \sim2.90 A-thick SeFeSe building blocks are in close proximity separated from each other by only \sim2.55 A [Fig. 4(d)].[8] This contrasts sharply with the enhanced interlayer separation in the FeAs analogs (e.g., inter-slab separation is \sim5.79 A in SmFeAsO which comprises interleaved SmO layers[28] and \sim3.45 and 3.34 A in SrFe_{2}As_{2} and LiFeAs which possess Sr^{2+} and Li^{+} spacers, respectively).[5, 6] As a result, the c axis in FeSe is only marginally larger (1.03 times) than the average basal plane dimensions. The electronic consequence of this structural size proximity should be to render the electronic structure of FeSe more three dimensional in nature than those of any of the related FeAs superconductors. Moreover, given the softness of the interlayer Se-Se interactions relative to the covalently bonded SeFeSe slabs, the application of pressure should have a profound influence on the structural and electronic dimensionalities, allowing their tuning at interlayer contact separations inaccessible in other currently known Fe-based superconductors. This is of key importance if we recall both the extreme sensitivity of T_{c} to P and its nonmonotonic response at high P. The distinct structural response to P of \alpha-FeSe is clearly apparent by considering the compressibility and its anisotropy [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)]. Firstly, the low-T bulk modulus, K_{0}=30.7(1.1) GPa is the smallest measured thus far in any of these systems--K_{0} is 57.3(6) GPa for LiFeAs,[22] 78(2) GPa for LaFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1}, and 102(2) GPa for NdFeAsO_{0.88}F_{0.12}.[20, 21] In addition, the compressibility of \alpha-FeSe along the interlayer direction is the largest among these systems--the c axis contracts by 7.3% at 7.5 GPa--while the basal plane compressibility (contraction by 3.3% at 7.5 GPa) is comparable to that in LiFeAs but considerably larger than those of the iron oxyarsenides.

This sets the scene to discuss the pressure response of T_{c} in \alpha-FeSe and its relationship to the structural evolution with P. Figures 4(a) and 4(c) show the pressure dependence at 16 K of the Fe-Se and Se-Se interatomic distances. The Fe-Se bonds contract smoothly with an overall decrease of 2.9% at 9.0 GPa. Similarly the intralayer Se-Se distances decrease monotonically with a somewhat larger contraction of 3.8%. However, the pressure response of the interlayer Se-Se contacts is much steeper with a 9.1% decrease reflecting the very large interlayer compressibility--the SeFeSe slabs approach each other rapidly up to 7.5 GPa but then their contact distance appears to saturate. As a result, there is a correlation between the pressure evolution of the unit-cell metrics and

  the superconducting T_{c} [Fig. 4(f)]. At low pressures, the rapid increase in (_a+b_)/2c is mirrored by the rapidly increasing T_{c} (\alpha-FeSe has the smallest bulk modulus and highest pressure coefficient of T_{c} among the Fe-based superconductors). Remarkably the pressure range at which the maximum T_{c} is found coincides with the onset of the structural anomalies. While the basal plane lattice constants continue to contract smoothly, the interlayer spacing begins to expand slightly leading to a decreasing (_a+b_)/2c ratio as P increases above 7.5 GPa. Thus it is tempting to ascribe the nonmonotonic T_{c}(P) behavior to the competition between the effects of the interlayer FeSe interactions (tuning the doping level) and the intralayer FeSe bonding and suggests that higher T_{c}'s are associated with smaller interlayer spacings (increased dimensionality).

Figures 4(b) and 4(c) show the pressure dependence at 16 K of the thickness of the FeSeSe slabs and the crystallographic bond angles of the FeSe_{4} tetrahedra [Fig. 4(e)]. It has been argued for the iron (oxy)arsenides that the geometry of the edge-sharing FeAs_{4} tetrahedral units sensitively controls the width of the electronic conduction band and therefore the magnitudes of the slab thickness and the As-Fe-As angles are important parameters in tuning the electronic properties of these systems and determining T_{c}.[29, 30, 31] Empirically T_{c} appears to be maximal when the FeAs_{4} units are close to regular with As-Fe-As angles of 109.47deg.[31] Along these lines, the observation of negative pressure coefficients of T_{c} has been rationalized in terms of increased tetrahedral distortion away from regular shape.[21, 22, 23]\alpha-FeSe has an identical distortion mode of the FeSe_{4} tetrahedra with a sizable distortion away from regularity [7.5deg angle difference, Fig. 4(e)]. However, while the distortion also increases significantly with increasing P and the SeFeSe slab thickness decreases [Figs. 4(b) and 4(c)], the pressure coefficient of T_{c} is positive in this range, implying that the empirical generalization which appears to hold well for the iron (oxy)arsenides is not applicable in the present system--apparently the dependence of the electronic structure on the interlayer separation dominates in determining the superconducting properties of \alpha-FeSe.

Finally, we discuss the high-P\alpha\rightarrow\beta transformation. First, pressurization leads to a rapid decrease in the \alpha-phase Se-Se interlayer contacts, which approach a value of 3.3 A at 7.5 GPa. As a result, the sign of the compressibility along c changes and the interlayer spacing begins to increase upon further increase in P. In addition, the three-dimensional \beta-FeSe is more densely packed than the quasi-two-dimensional \alpha polymorph. The large difference in packing density is retained at high P and at 9.0 GPa, the \alpha\rightarrow\beta transition is accompanied by a \sim15.1% decrease in volume as the Fe-Se coordination changes from tetrahedral to the more densely packed octahedral one. At the same time, the transition results in an increase in the Fe-Fe and Fe-Se distances by 7.4% and 4.9%, respectively. These observations point toward a scenario where the \alpha phase cannot sustain pressures above 9 GPa as the interlayer separation is now so small that it is energetically favorable to form the more efficiently packed \beta phase with a release of the bonding distances.

Recently, a paper appeared with partially overlapping results on the pressure dependence of T_{c} (which is found to reach a maximum of 36.7 K at 8.9 GPa) and the stability of the \alpha-FeSe phase (which transforms to the nonsuperconducting hexagonal NiAs-type phase above 7 GPa at ambient temperature) that are in excellent agreement to those presented here.[33]

## V Conclusion

In conclusion, we have found that the superconductivity onset in \alpha-FeSe attains a broad maximum of 37 K at \sim7 GPa. The orthorhombically distorted superconducting phase is extremely soft and the pressure response of the structure reveals an intimate link between the SeFeSe interlayer separations and the superconducting properties. Detailed band-structure calculations should be able to shed light on the accompanying evolution of the doping level of the SeFeSe layers and decipher the relative importance between the increased dimensionality and the FeSe slab geometry to superconductivity.

###### Abstract

\alpha-FeSe with the PbO structure is a key member of the family of high-T_{c} iron pnictide and chalcogenide superconductors, as while it possesses the basic layered structural motif of edge-sharing distorted FeSe_{4} tetrahedra, it lacks interleaved ion spacers or charge-reservoir layers. We find that the application of hydrostatic pressure first rapidly increases T_{c} which attains a broad maximum of 37 K at \sim 7 GPa before decreasing to 6 K upon further compression to \sim14 GPa. Complementary synchrotron x-ray diffraction at 16 K was used to measure the low-temperature isothermal compressibility of \alpha-FeSe, revealing an extremely soft solid with a bulk modulus, K_{0}=30.7(1.1) GPa and strong bonding anisotropy between interlayer and intralayer directions that transforms to the more densely packed \beta polymorph above \sim9 GPa. The nonmonotonic T_{c}(P) behavior of FeSe coincides with drastic anomalies in the pressure evolution of the interlayer spacing, pointing to the key role of this structural feature in modulating the electronic properties.

## I Introduction

The \alpha polymorph of the simple binary FeSe phase has recently emerged as a superconductor with an ambient PT_{c} of \sim8-13 K.[1, 2] Its structure comprises stacks of edge-sharing FeSe_{4} tetrahedra with a packing motif essentially identical to that of the FeAs layers in the families of the FeAs-based high-T_{c} superconductors [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] but lacking any interleaved ion spacers or insulating layers. The structural analogy is reinforced by the observation that below 70 K the high-temperature crystal structure becomes orthorhombic (space group Cmma),[8] displaying an identical distortion of the FeSe layers to that observed in the iron oxyarsenide family.[9, 10] Theoretical calculations also find a very similar two-dimensional electronic structure to that of the FeAs-based superconductors with cylindrical electron sections at the Brillouin-zone corner and cylindrical hole surface sections.[11] Moreover, superconductivity in FeSe is very sensitive to defects and disorder and occurs over a limited range of FeSe_{1-\delta} nonstoichiometry.[12]

The effect of applied pressure on T_{c} provides crucial information to differentiate between competing models of superconductivity and in the FeSe binary, T_{c} is initially extremely sensitive to P and rises rapidly to 27 K at 1.48 GPa.[2] At the same time, antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations present above T_{c} are strongly enhanced by pressure.[13] In the FeAs-based superconductors, the response of T_{c} to pressure is complex and sensitively depends on the composition of the materials and their doping level. Both positive and negative initial pressure coefficients, dT_{c}/dP have been measured. Typically for the REFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} families, dT_{c}/dP is positive at low doping levels and switches over to a negative value as x increases.[14, 15, 16, 17, 18] Moreover, for systems where the initial dT_{c}/dP is positive, there is a critical value of P above which the trend is reversed and T_{c} decreases upon further pressurization.[14, 19]

Despite the importance of the evolution of T_{c} with P in understanding the superconducting properties of the Fe-based materials, there is currently little information on the detailed pressure dependence of their structural properties.[20, 21, 22] Here we report on the conducting properties of FeSe as a function of P up to \sim14 GPa; we find a very high initial pressure coefficient with T_{c} maximized at 37 K at \sim7 GPa. At higher P, dT_{c}/dP becomes negative and T_{c} is reduced to 6 K at \sim14 GPa. We also study the precise pressure evolution to 12.8 GPa of the FeSe structure at 16 K (i.e., well within the superconducting regime) by synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction. We find that the orthorhombic \alpha polymorph survives to \sim9 GPa whereupon the structure changes to that of the nonsuperconducting hexagonal \beta phase. T_{c} initially increases with P despite the decreasing SeFeSe thickness and the increasing distortion of the FeSe_{4} units while the subsequent decrease clearly correlates with changes in the FeSe interlayer spacing.

## II Experimental details

The FeSe polycrystalline sample used in this work was prepared, as reported elsewhere.[2] High resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction at ambient P is consistent with a stoichiometry Fe_{1.03}Se. Electrical resistivity measurements under high pressures were performed by a standard four-probe technique using a diamond-anvil cell (DAC). Powdered NaCl was used as pressure-transmitting medium. Pressure  was applied at room temperature and measured by the ruby fluorescence method. The measured values at low temperature are used to discuss the pressure dependence of T_{c}. The high-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction experiments at 16 K were performed at beamline BL10XU, SPring-8. The powder sample was loaded in a membrane DAC, which was placed inside a closed-cycle helium refrigerator. Daphne(tm) oil was used as a pressure medium. The applied pressure measured with the ruby fluorescence method was increased at 16 K without dismounting the cell from the cryostat. The diffraction patterns (\lambda = 0.41118 A) were collected using a flat image plate detector up to 12.8 GPa. Data analysis of the diffraction profiles was performed with the GSAS suite of Rietveld programs.

## III Results

Figure 1(a) shows the temperature dependence of the resistance of the FeSe sample at various pressures. Superconductivity was observed below 13.4 K with a fairly sharp onset (run 1). T_{c} is found to increase initially rapidly upon the application of pressure with an accompanying increase in width and reaches a broad maximum of 37 K at 6.6 GPa--for binary solids, this high T_{c} is only surpassed by Cs3C60 (38 K) (Ref. [23]) and MgB2 (39 K).[24] In a second experiment (run 2), P was increased first directly to 7.6 GPa and then to 13.9 GPa where the onset T_{c} is smaller at 6 K [Fig. 1(b)]. Pressure release to near ambient and subsequent pressurization to 9.7 GPa (run 3) resulted in smaller values of T_{c}--this may be related to the irreversibility of the \alpha \rightarrow \beta structural transformation (_vide infra_) [Fig. 3(d)].

Inspection of the diffraction profile at 16 K and 0.25 GPa [Fig. 2(a)] readily reveals the orthorhombic (O) unit cell (space group Cmma) established for \alpha-FeSe below 70 K at ambient P.[8] Additional peaks are also evident and these can be accounted for by the presence of a minority hexagonal NiAs-type \beta-FeSe phase [31.7(1)% fraction] (Table 1). The diffraction data sets collected with increasing P show no structural changes for \alpha-FeSe between 0.25 and 7.5 GPa with the \alpha/\beta-phase assemblage remaining unaltered [Fig. 2(b)]. The same structural model was therefore employed in the Rietveld refinements in this pressure range, revealing a monotonic decrease in the lattice constants and unit-cell volume with increasing P [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)]. However, the response of the lattice metrics to P is strongly anisotropic with the interlayer spacing showing a significantly larger contraction than the intralayer dimensions. As P increases, 2c/(a + b) smoothly decreases until at \sim4 GPa, it approaches 1. Further increase in P leads to an even higher compression of the FeSe interlayer spacing [Fig. 3(c)] with [2c/(a + b)] = 0.987(2) at 7.5 GPa. However, as the sample is pressed to 9.0 GPa [Fig. 2(c)], the \alpha-phase fraction begins to decrease and then it sharply collapses [inset of Fig. 2(b)]

The lower green solid lines show the difference profiles and the tick marks show the reflection positions of the \alpha-(upper) and \beta-(lower) phases, respectively. The diffraction profile collected at 12.1 GPa clearly shows the \alpha \rightarrow \beta phase transformation. The \beta phase undergoes a phase transition from hexagonal to orthorhombic at 6.0 GPa.

  with an almost complete a - b transformation taking place--at 12.1 GPa, the _a_-phase fraction is ~12% [Fig. 2(d)]. At the same time, while the basal plane lattice constants continue to contract, c begins to increase, resulting in saturation of the volume response to pressure and an increasing _2c_/(_a_ + _b_) ratio [Figs. 3(a)-3(c)]. Gradual depressurization to ~2 GPa does not lead to recovery of the orthorhombic a polymorph (its fraction remains at ~12%), implying that the a - b phase transformation is irreversible at these low temperatures. Recovery of _a_-FeSe (53% fraction) at this P necessitated heating of the sample inside the DAC to 300 K.25

The volume compressibility, \kappa=d ln V/dP=0.033(1) GPa^{-1} implies a soft highly compressible solid. A comparable value of the bulk modulus \sim33 GPa at 50 K has been proposed from neutron-diffraction measurements over a restricted 0-0.6 GPa range.[27] The anisotropy in bonding of the \alpha-FeSe structure [Fig. 4(d)] is clearly evident in Fig. 3(a) which displays the variation in the orthorhombic lattice constants with P. \alpha-FeSe is least compressible in the basal plane in which the covalent Fe-Se bonds lie (d ln a/dP =0.029(2) GPa^{-1}, d ln b/dP=0.026(3) GPa^{-1}) while the interlayer compressibility, d ln c/dP=0.065(4) GPa^{-1} is \sim2.5 times larger, implying very soft Se-Se interlayer interactions.

## IV Discussion

The immediate consequence of the structural simplicity of FeSe is that the \sim2.90 A-thick SeFeSe building blocks are in close proximity separated from each other by only \sim2.55 A [Fig. 4(d)].[8] This contrasts sharply with the enhanced interlayer separation in the FeAs analogs (e.g., inter-slab separation is \sim5.79 A in SmFeAsO which comprises interleaved SmO layers[28] and \sim3.45 and 3.34 A in SrFe_{2}As_{2} and LiFeAs which possess Sr^{2+} and Li^{+} spacers, respectively).[5, 6] As a result, the c axis in FeSe is only marginally larger (1.03 times) than the average basal plane dimensions. The electronic consequence of this structural size proximity should be to render the electronic structure of FeSe more three dimensional in nature than those of any of the related FeAs superconductors. Moreover, given the softness of the interlayer Se-Se interactions relative to the covalently bonded SeFeSe slabs, the application of pressure should have a profound influence on the structural and electronic dimensionalities, allowing their tuning at interlayer contact separations inaccessible in other currently known Fe-based superconductors. This is of key importance if we recall both the extreme sensitivity of T_{c} to P and its nonmonotonic response at high P. The distinct structural response to P of \alpha-FeSe is clearly apparent by considering the compressibility and its anisotropy [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)]. Firstly, the low-T bulk modulus, K_{0}=30.7(1.1) GPa is the smallest measured thus far in any of these systems--K_{0} is 57.3(6) GPa for LiFeAs,[22] 78(2) GPa for LaFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1}, and 102(2) GPa for NdFeAsO_{0.88}F_{0.12}.[20, 21] In addition, the compressibility of \alpha-FeSe along the interlayer direction is the largest among these systems--the c axis contracts by 7.3% at 7.5 GPa--while the basal plane compressibility (contraction by 3.3% at 7.5 GPa) is comparable to that in LiFeAs but considerably larger than those of the iron oxyarsenides.

This sets the scene to discuss the pressure response of T_{c} in \alpha-FeSe and its relationship to the structural evolution with P. Figures 4(a) and 4(c) show the pressure dependence at 16 K of the Fe-Se and Se-Se interatomic distances. The Fe-Se bonds contract smoothly with an overall decrease of 2.9% at 9.0 GPa. Similarly the intralayer Se-Se distances decrease monotonically with a somewhat larger contraction of 3.8%. However, the pressure response of the interlayer Se-Se contacts is much steeper with a 9.1% decrease reflecting the very large interlayer compressibility--the SeFeSe slabs approach each other rapidly up to 7.5 GPa but then their contact distance appears to saturate. As a result, there is a correlation between the pressure evolution of the unit-cell metrics and

  the superconducting T_{c} [Fig. 4(f)]. At low pressures, the rapid increase in (_a+b_)/2c is mirrored by the rapidly increasing T_{c} (\alpha-FeSe has the smallest bulk modulus and highest pressure coefficient of T_{c} among the Fe-based superconductors). Remarkably the pressure range at which the maximum T_{c} is found coincides with the onset of the structural anomalies. While the basal plane lattice constants continue to contract smoothly, the interlayer spacing begins to expand slightly leading to a decreasing (_a+b_)/2c ratio as P increases above 7.5 GPa. Thus it is tempting to ascribe the nonmonotonic T_{c}(P) behavior to the competition between the effects of the interlayer FeSe interactions (tuning the doping level) and the intralayer FeSe bonding and suggests that higher T_{c}'s are associated with smaller interlayer spacings (increased dimensionality).

Figures 4(b) and 4(c) show the pressure dependence at 16 K of the thickness of the FeSeSe slabs and the crystallographic bond angles of the FeSe_{4} tetrahedra [Fig. 4(e)]. It has been argued for the iron (oxy)arsenides that the geometry of the edge-sharing FeAs_{4} tetrahedral units sensitively controls the width of the electronic conduction band and therefore the magnitudes of the slab thickness and the As-Fe-As angles are important parameters in tuning the electronic properties of these systems and determining T_{c}.[29, 30, 31] Empirically T_{c} appears to be maximal when the FeAs_{4} units are close to regular with As-Fe-As angles of 109.47deg.[31] Along these lines, the observation of negative pressure coefficients of T_{c} has been rationalized in terms of increased tetrahedral distortion away from regular shape.[21, 22, 23]\alpha-FeSe has an identical distortion mode of the FeSe_{4} tetrahedra with a sizable distortion away from regularity [7.5deg angle difference, Fig. 4(e)]. However, while the distortion also increases significantly with increasing P and the SeFeSe slab thickness decreases [Figs. 4(b) and 4(c)], the pressure coefficient of T_{c} is positive in this range, implying that the empirical generalization which appears to hold well for the iron (oxy)arsenides is not applicable in the present system--apparently the dependence of the electronic structure on the interlayer separation dominates in determining the superconducting properties of \alpha-FeSe.

Finally, we discuss the high-P\alpha\rightarrow\beta transformation. First, pressurization leads to a rapid decrease in the \alpha-phase Se-Se interlayer contacts, which approach a value of 3.3 A at 7.5 GPa. As a result, the sign of the compressibility along c changes and the interlayer spacing begins to increase upon further increase in P. In addition, the three-dimensional \beta-FeSe is more densely packed than the quasi-two-dimensional \alpha polymorph. The large difference in packing density is retained at high P and at 9.0 GPa, the \alpha\rightarrow\beta transition is accompanied by a \sim15.1% decrease in volume as the Fe-Se coordination changes from tetrahedral to the more densely packed octahedral one. At the same time, the transition results in an increase in the Fe-Fe and Fe-Se distances by 7.4% and 4.9%, respectively. These observations point toward a scenario where the \alpha phase cannot sustain pressures above 9 GPa as the interlayer separation is now so small that it is energetically favorable to form the more efficiently packed \beta phase with a release of the bonding distances.

Recently, a paper appeared with partially overlapping results on the pressure dependence of T_{c} (which is found to reach a maximum of 36.7 K at 8.9 GPa) and the stability of the \alpha-FeSe phase (which transforms to the nonsuperconducting hexagonal NiAs-type phase above 7 GPa at ambient temperature) that are in excellent agreement to those presented here.[33]

## V Conclusion

In conclusion, we have found that the superconductivity onset in \alpha-FeSe attains a broad maximum of 37 K at \sim7 GPa. The orthorhombically distorted superconducting phase is extremely soft and the pressure response of the structure reveals an intimate link between the SeFeSe interlayer separations and the superconducting properties. Detailed band-structure calculations should be able to shed light on the accompanying evolution of the doping level of the SeFeSe layers and decipher the relative importance between the increased dimensionality and the FeSe slab geometry to superconductivity.
