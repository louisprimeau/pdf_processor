###### Abstract

We present a detailed study of single crystalline K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} and analyze its thermodynamic and transport properties, anisotropic H_{c2}(T), and initial pressure dependence of T_{c}. In zero field, the temperature-dependent resistivity is metallic. Deviation from a linear temperature dependence is evident below 100 K and a T^{3} dependence is roughly followed from just above T_{c} (\sim10 K) to \sim40 K. Anisotropic H_{c2}(T) data were measured up to 140 kOe with field applied along and perpendicular to the rodlike crystals. For the applied field perpendicular to the rod, H_{c2}(T) is linear with a slope \sim-70 kOe/K. For field applied along the rod, the slope is about -120 kOe/K below 70 kOe. Above 70 kOe, the magnitude of the slope decreases to \sim\sim70 kOe/K. The electronic specific heat coefficient \gamma, just above T_{c}, is 73 mJ/mol K^{2}; the Debye temperature \Theta_{D} is 220 K. The specific heat jump at the superconducting transition \Delta C\sim 2.2\gamma T_{c}. Finally, for hydrostatic pressures up to \sim7 kbar, T_{c} decreases under pressure linearly at a rate of -0.034K/kbar.

## 1 Introduction

K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} has been recently discovered as a new superconducting material with a T_{c} of 6.1 K [1]. Having a structure that contains (Cr_{3}As_{3})^{2-} chains, it has quickly aroused interest as a potentially new quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) superconductor. Related compounds, Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} and Cs_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}, with T_{c} values of about 4.8 and 2.2 K, respectively, were reported soon after the discovery of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}[2, 3]. Band structure calculations were also conducted and compared with experimental results [4]. In the initial report [1], data were acquired primarily on polycrystalline samples of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}. For Q1D superconductors, it is believed that with a magnetic field applied along the chain, the upper critical field H_{c2} should be much higher than that when the field is along other directions due to minimized orbital pair breaking. Experimentally, this was observed for Q1D systems such as Li_{0.9}Mo_{0.0}O_{17} and (TMTSF)ClO_{4}[5, 6]. In this Rapid Communication, we present detailed anisotropic H_{c2}(T) data via resistance measurements on K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} single crystals. In addition, with the recent discovery of the isostructural compound Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}, with a larger unit cell and a lower T_{c} value, it is interesting to study the pressure dependence of T_{c} of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}. Results from low-field dc magnetization measurements with pressures up to 7 kbar will be presented.

K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} single crystals were grown using a high-temperature solution growth method [7]. A schematic drawing of the Matryoshka-like ampoule assembly for crystal synthesis is shown in Fig. 1(a). Elemental K, Cr, and As [in bulk(lump) form] were packed in an alumina crucible following the ratio listed in Ref. [1] (K:Cr:As = 6 : 1 : 7). The crucibles and starting material were then welded into a tantalum tube and sealed in a silica ampoule under a partial argon atmosphere. To avoid a possible explosion due to the high vapor pressure of the unreacted elements, the whole ampoule was slowly heated up to 1000 ^{\circ}C over 2 days. It was then cooled down over \sim100 h to 700 ^{\circ}C, at which temperature the single crystals and the remaining liquid were separated in a centrifuge by the alumina strainer that was placed in between the growth side crucible and an empty (catch) crucible. The crystals obtained are rodlike [Fig. 1(b)] and malleable. A rough powder x-ray diffraction pattern was collected on ground/deformed crystals using a Rigaku Miniflex unit located in a N_{2} glove box. The data, along with a fit to the crystallographic data given in Ref. [1], are shown in Fig. 1(d) and are consistent with the single crystals adopting the hexagonal, a = 9.983 A, c = 4.230 A unit cell. Given the unit cell dimensions and single crystal morphology, we identify the rod direction as being along the crystallographic c axis.

Resistance was measured using a standard four-probe technique. DuPont 4929N silver paint was used to attach platinum wires onto the sample in a N_{2} glove box. Electric current was applied along the rod for anisotropic H_{c2} measurements [Fig. 1(c)]. Long, straight samples were used and supported by flat plastic pads for all resistivity measurements to avoid potential torque that could deform the crystals and thus change their alignment. The resistivity was estimated assuming the sample has a cylindrical shape. The absolute value of the resistivity is therefore only accurate to within a factor of 3. The temperature- and field-dependent resistance was measured in a Quantum Design (QD) physical property measurement system, PPMS-14 (T = 1.8-305 K, H = 0-140 kOe). Specific heat data were measured using a QD PPMS via relaxation method. A ^{3}He option was utilized to obtain specific heat data down to 0.4 K. Specific heat data were measured on a "raft" assembled out of several single crystals. Despite the fact that the samples' shape and arrangement were not ideal for such measurements, the coupling constant was high, between 96% and 100%.

The pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} was determined via low-field (20 Oe), zero-field-cooled (ZFC), dc magnetization measurements in a QD magnetic property measurement system (MPMS) using a commercial (HMD) Be-Cu piston cylinder pressure cell [8]. Daphne oil 7373 was used as the pressure medium and Pb was used as the manometer [9]. Since the samples are very air sensitive, exposure to air was limited as much as possible to avoid oxidation.

The temperature dependence of the resistivity of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} is metallic, as shown in Fig. 2. The residual resistance ratio  (RRR) is about 50, a factor of 5 better than the RRR \sim 10 found for the polycrystalline data [1]. A clear, sharp transition at 6.1 K indicates the superconducting transition.

At room temperature, the resistivity is of the same order of magnitude as the reported value [1]. However, in contrast to the reported linear temperature dependence from 7 to 300 K in Ref. [1], we see a clear deviation from linearity below \sim100 K. For the four samples we have measured, we get slopes of 3.0, 2.8, 3.1, and 3.1 from a log(\rho-\rho_{0}) vs \log T plot between 10 and 40 K. Therefore, in the left inset of Fig. 2, we plot the resistance data from several samples normalized to their value at 40 K as a function of T^{3}. It is clear that a T^{3} power law describes these data well over the temperature region that is shown. The slight deviation below 10 K might due to the proximity to the superconducting transition. Although we did not see a temperature region where Fermi-liquid behavior is dominant, this could be due to the fact that the measurement temperature is not low enough as compared with its Debye temperature. As will be discussed below, due to the extremely large H_{c2} values associated with this compound, measuring normal state resistivity to low temperatures will require extremely high magnetic fields.

In the normal state, despite a relatively large RRR value, virtually no magnetoresistance was observed. The right inset of Fig. 2 shows the normalized resistance as a function of applied field for both transverse (H\perp I) and longitudinal (H\parallel I) directions of the applied field. Right above the T_{c}, the resistance stays close to constant up to 140 kOe. Given this null response, an upper limit of 2% (at 140 kOe) can be set on the low-temperature magnetoresistance.

Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the temperature-dependent resistance R(T) measured under different magnetic fields for H\parallel rod and H\perp rod, respectively. Figure 3(c) shows the anisotropic H_{c2}(T) data for K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} from several samples. The superconducting transition is very sharp in our resistivity measurements. The inset to Fig. 3(c) shows that, at over 125 kOe, the onsets and offsets of the transition differ by less than 0.25 K as opposed to an over 0.6 K width at 80 kOe for polycrystalline data [1]. An offset criterion [10] was used to determine T_{c} [see the inset of Fig. 3(c)]. For field applied perpendicular to the rod, the T_{c} decreases almost linearly with increasing magnetic field. The slope is \sim-70 kOe/K. For field applied along the rod, the initial slope is roughly -120 kOe/K, and above 70 kOe the slope is close to -70 kOe/K, which is similar to that when field is applied perpendicular to the rod. Different batches of samples as well as field-sweep data at fixed temperature give consistent results. In Fig. 3(c), data from Ref. [1] are plotted as blue solid diamonds. It is close to what we obtained for field perpendicular to the rod and the slope is consistent with our current results.

From one-band BCS theory, for an s-wave, isotropic material, in the clean limit, the orbital H_{c2}^{\text{orb}}=-0.73|dH_{c2}/dT|_{T}T_{c}[11]. In our case, for field perpendicular to the rod, H_{c2}^{\text{orb}}\sim 312 kOe. The Pauli limit for a simple BCS superconductor is H^{p}=1.84T_{c}=110 kOe. The H_{c2} of real systems will be influenced by both H_{c2}^{\text{orb}} and H^{p}. The Maki parameter [12] that describes the relative importance of the two critical field limits, \alpha=\sqrt{2}H_{c2}^{\text{orb}}/H^{p}, is equal to 4. This suggests that at low temperatures, the H_{c2} might be Pauli limited. With the current data up to 140 kOe that exceed the one-band BCS estimated Pauli limit, we see no clear sign of saturation of H_{c2}. Note

  that, with multiband as well as varying coupling strength, the Pauli limit can be different from a one-band BCS prediction. For example, in many Fe-based superconductors, H^{p} values are significantly enhanced [13].

The specific heat data from K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} are shown in Fig. 4. A clear jump in the specific heat at around 6 K corresponds to the superconducting transition. In the normal state, C=\gamma\,T+\beta\,T^{3} fits the data quite well. In the range of 7-10 K, we obtained a \gamma\sim 73 mJ/mol K^{2} and the Debye temperature \Theta_{D}, derived from \beta, is around 220 K. These data are consistent with recently reported values [1]. At the superconducting transition, the specific heat jump is roughly 2.2\gamma\,T_{c}. This is larger than the simple s-wave BCS prediction and comparable to the value obtained in Ref. [1]. Possibly, strong coupling is involved [14]. Below 1.5 K, we observe a clear upturn in C/T. Assuming that the normal state values of \gamma and \beta stay constant below T_{c}, this upturn exacerbates the difficulty of having entropy conserved, which was already hinted at in the previously reported data down to 2 K [1]. Additional, nonsuperconducting contributions, such as impurities or a nuclear Schottky anomaly, may be responsible for this low-temperature rise. But whatever its origin, it makes fitting of the data to specific models problematic.

At ambient pressure, the normal state dc magnetic susceptibility (\chi=M/H) is \sim0.9\times 10^{-3} emu/mol and decreases by more than 30% from 7 to 300 K (Fig. 5). If we fit these data to a Curie-Weiss law, we find a temperature-independent susceptibility \chi_{0}\sim 0.7\times 10^{-3} emu/mol, a small effective moment of 0.36\mu_{B}/R_{V}, for 0.21\mu_{B}/Cr), and a Curie-Weiss temperature \Theta\sim-40 K. At this point in time, it is not clear if such a local-moment fit is appropriate or intrinsic for this material. Given that \gamma=9 mJ/mol atom K^{2} is relatively high, it is appropriate to contrast it with the magnetic susceptibility. Assuming spin = 1/2, the estimated Wilson ratio [15]R_{W} is in a range of 0.9-1.1 by taking the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility value. If we consider the Curie tail as a result of an impurity contribution and thus take the value of temperature-independent \chi_{0}, R_{W} is about 0.7. These values

The inset shows a typical superconducting transition measured at 125 264 Oe, with red solid lines and the arrow indicating the criteria for determining the transition temperature (see more in text).

  are close to what one would expect for a Fermi-liquid system (R_{W}=1).

Zero-field-cooled dc magnetization data are shown in the right inset of Fig. 6. The superconducting transition appears sharply at 6.1 K, consistent with both resistance and specific heat measurements. To avoid oxidation, which could affect both sample mass and superconducting volume fraction, the sample mass was measured in a glove box and exposure to air was minimized.

At 2 K, the low-field M(H) data deviate from the linear field dependence at around 70 Oe (see the inset of Fig. 5). The minimum in magnetization appears at around 400 Oe. Taking H_{c1}=70 Oe and H_{c2}\sim H_{c2}^{\text{obs}}=312 kOe and using H_{c1}/H_{c2}=\ln(\kappa)/2\kappa^{2}, the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter \kappa is \sim100. From the specific heat jump at T_{c} using the Rutgers relation \Delta C/T_{c}=(1/8\pi\kappa^{2})(dH_{c2}/dT)^{2}|_{T_{c}}[16], we obtain a similar \kappa value of 116. This high value of \kappa suggests that K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} is deep in the type II regime.

The pressure dependence of T_{c} is plotted in Fig. 6. The superconducting transition of Pb was used to determine the pressure within the pressure cell [9]. As shown in the left inset of Fig. 6, both superconducting transitions from the Pb and the sample are clear. Up to 7 kbar, the T_{c} value for K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} decreases linearly with increasing pressure at a rate of -0.034 K/kbar. Given that the larger-unit-celled Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} undergoes a superconducting transition at a slightly lower temperature, 4.8 K, the effects of chemical and physical pressure are clearly not equivalent in this material.

In conclusion, we grew single crystals of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} using a high-temperature solution growth method. Being able to decant the molten solution at high temperature allows us to get relatively large, free-standing, high-quality single crystals, which also enables us to perform all of our measurements on single crystals or their arrays. In contrast to previously reported linear-temperature-dependent resistivity from 300 down to 7 K, the resistivity of a single crystal with a RRR of 50 (RRR \sim 10 for polycrystalline samples [1]) deviates from the linear temperature dependence below 100 K and roughly follows T^{3} over the range of 10-40 K. Whereas the differences between the single crystalline and polycrystalline sample transports are easily explained by grain-boundary scattering and potential resistive anisotropies, the rather clear T^{3} power law that we observe will require more experimental and theoretical investigations. Despite the fact that the temperature dependence is different, if the RRR values reflect the intrinsic quality of the samples, and are not due to grain-boundary scattering, the independence of T_{c} on the value of RRR, or impurity scattering, suggests a conventional mechanism of its superconductivity. Anisotropic H_{c2}(T) data up to 140 kOe were obtained from resistivity measurements. Up to 140 kOe, for field applied perpendicular to the rod, H_{c2}(T) is linear with a slope of -70 kOe/K. For field along the rod, dH_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}} is about -120 kOe/K. Above 70 kOe, the slope decreases to around -70 kOe/K. The T_{c} as well as the slope of H_{c2} is close to previously reported data [1]. The anisotropy in H_{c2} is not as large as one would generally expect for a Q1D superconductor. Virtually zero magnetoresistance was observed at temperatures right above the T_{c}. The electronic specific heat \gamma is 73 mJ/mol K^{2} or 9 mJ/mol atom K^{2}. Although this is a relatively large value, the equally enhanced magnetic susceptibility leads to a Wilson ratio that is close to 1 and suggests Fermi-liquid-like properties. At ambient pressure, H_{c1} is close to 70 Oe, which results in a GL parameter that is \sim100, taking 312 kOe as the estimated H_{c2}. For pressures up to 7 kbar, the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} decreases linearly with a rate of -0.034 K/kbar. Comparing to the newly discovered Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}, it seems to suggest that physical pressure and chemical pressure have different effects on the superconductivity in these compounds.

Despite the fact that K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} can be considered to be close to Q1D in a crystallographic sense, the "small" anisotropy in H_{c2} appears to suggest a rather three-dimensional nature. In addition, the exotic pairing symmetry requires more detailed study.

K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} has been recently discovered as a new superconducting material with a T_{c} of 6.1 K [1]. Having a structure that contains (Cr_{3}As_{3})^{2-} chains, it has quickly aroused interest as a potentially new quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) superconductor. Related compounds, Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} and Cs_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}, with T_{c} values of about 4.8 and 2.2 K, respectively, were reported soon after the discovery of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}[2, 3]. Band structure calculations were also conducted and compared with experimental results [4]. In the initial report [1], data were acquired primarily on polycrystalline samples of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}. For Q1D superconductors, it is believed that with a magnetic field applied along the chain, the upper critical field H_{c2} should be much higher than that when the field is along other directions due to minimized orbital pair breaking. Experimentally, this was observed for Q1D systems such as Li_{0.9}Mo_{0.0}O_{17} and (TMTSF)ClO_{4}[5, 6]. In this Rapid Communication, we present detailed anisotropic H_{c2}(T) data via resistance measurements on K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} single crystals. In addition, with the recent discovery of the isostructural compound Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}, with a larger unit cell and a lower T_{c} value, it is interesting to study the pressure dependence of T_{c} of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}. Results from low-field dc magnetization measurements with pressures up to 7 kbar will be presented.

K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} single crystals were grown using a high-temperature solution growth method [7]. A schematic drawing of the Matryoshka-like ampoule assembly for crystal synthesis is shown in Fig. 1(a). Elemental K, Cr, and As [in bulk(lump) form] were packed in an alumina crucible following the ratio listed in Ref. [1] (K:Cr:As = 6 : 1 : 7). The crucibles and starting material were then welded into a tantalum tube and sealed in a silica ampoule under a partial argon atmosphere. To avoid a possible explosion due to the high vapor pressure of the unreacted elements, the whole ampoule was slowly heated up to 1000 ^{\circ}C over 2 days. It was then cooled down over \sim100 h to 700 ^{\circ}C, at which temperature the single crystals and the remaining liquid were separated in a centrifuge by the alumina strainer that was placed in between the growth side crucible and an empty (catch) crucible. The crystals obtained are rodlike [Fig. 1(b)] and malleable. A rough powder x-ray diffraction pattern was collected on ground/deformed crystals using a Rigaku Miniflex unit located in a N_{2} glove box. The data, along with a fit to the crystallographic data given in Ref. [1], are shown in Fig. 1(d) and are consistent with the single crystals adopting the hexagonal, a = 9.983 A, c = 4.230 A unit cell. Given the unit cell dimensions and single crystal morphology, we identify the rod direction as being along the crystallographic c axis.

Resistance was measured using a standard four-probe technique. DuPont 4929N silver paint was used to attach platinum wires onto the sample in a N_{2} glove box. Electric current was applied along the rod for anisotropic H_{c2} measurements [Fig. 1(c)]. Long, straight samples were used and supported by flat plastic pads for all resistivity measurements to avoid potential torque that could deform the crystals and thus change their alignment. The resistivity was estimated assuming the sample has a cylindrical shape. The absolute value of the resistivity is therefore only accurate to within a factor of 3. The temperature- and field-dependent resistance was measured in a Quantum Design (QD) physical property measurement system, PPMS-14 (T = 1.8-305 K, H = 0-140 kOe). Specific heat data were measured using a QD PPMS via relaxation method. A ^{3}He option was utilized to obtain specific heat data down to 0.4 K. Specific heat data were measured on a "raft" assembled out of several single crystals. Despite the fact that the samples' shape and arrangement were not ideal for such measurements, the coupling constant was high, between 96% and 100%.

The pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} was determined via low-field (20 Oe), zero-field-cooled (ZFC), dc magnetization measurements in a QD magnetic property measurement system (MPMS) using a commercial (HMD) Be-Cu piston cylinder pressure cell [8]. Daphne oil 7373 was used as the pressure medium and Pb was used as the manometer [9]. Since the samples are very air sensitive, exposure to air was limited as much as possible to avoid oxidation.

The temperature dependence of the resistivity of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} is metallic, as shown in Fig. 2. The residual resistance ratio  (RRR) is about 50, a factor of 5 better than the RRR \sim 10 found for the polycrystalline data [1]. A clear, sharp transition at 6.1 K indicates the superconducting transition.

At room temperature, the resistivity is of the same order of magnitude as the reported value [1]. However, in contrast to the reported linear temperature dependence from 7 to 300 K in Ref. [1], we see a clear deviation from linearity below \sim100 K. For the four samples we have measured, we get slopes of 3.0, 2.8, 3.1, and 3.1 from a log(\rho-\rho_{0}) vs \log T plot between 10 and 40 K. Therefore, in the left inset of Fig. 2, we plot the resistance data from several samples normalized to their value at 40 K as a function of T^{3}. It is clear that a T^{3} power law describes these data well over the temperature region that is shown. The slight deviation below 10 K might due to the proximity to the superconducting transition. Although we did not see a temperature region where Fermi-liquid behavior is dominant, this could be due to the fact that the measurement temperature is not low enough as compared with its Debye temperature. As will be discussed below, due to the extremely large H_{c2} values associated with this compound, measuring normal state resistivity to low temperatures will require extremely high magnetic fields.

In the normal state, despite a relatively large RRR value, virtually no magnetoresistance was observed. The right inset of Fig. 2 shows the normalized resistance as a function of applied field for both transverse (H\perp I) and longitudinal (H\parallel I) directions of the applied field. Right above the T_{c}, the resistance stays close to constant up to 140 kOe. Given this null response, an upper limit of 2% (at 140 kOe) can be set on the low-temperature magnetoresistance.

Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the temperature-dependent resistance R(T) measured under different magnetic fields for H\parallel rod and H\perp rod, respectively. Figure 3(c) shows the anisotropic H_{c2}(T) data for K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} from several samples. The superconducting transition is very sharp in our resistivity measurements. The inset to Fig. 3(c) shows that, at over 125 kOe, the onsets and offsets of the transition differ by less than 0.25 K as opposed to an over 0.6 K width at 80 kOe for polycrystalline data [1]. An offset criterion [10] was used to determine T_{c} [see the inset of Fig. 3(c)]. For field applied perpendicular to the rod, the T_{c} decreases almost linearly with increasing magnetic field. The slope is \sim-70 kOe/K. For field applied along the rod, the initial slope is roughly -120 kOe/K, and above 70 kOe the slope is close to -70 kOe/K, which is similar to that when field is applied perpendicular to the rod. Different batches of samples as well as field-sweep data at fixed temperature give consistent results. In Fig. 3(c), data from Ref. [1] are plotted as blue solid diamonds. It is close to what we obtained for field perpendicular to the rod and the slope is consistent with our current results.

From one-band BCS theory, for an s-wave, isotropic material, in the clean limit, the orbital H_{c2}^{\text{orb}}=-0.73|dH_{c2}/dT|_{T}T_{c}[11]. In our case, for field perpendicular to the rod, H_{c2}^{\text{orb}}\sim 312 kOe. The Pauli limit for a simple BCS superconductor is H^{p}=1.84T_{c}=110 kOe. The H_{c2} of real systems will be influenced by both H_{c2}^{\text{orb}} and H^{p}. The Maki parameter [12] that describes the relative importance of the two critical field limits, \alpha=\sqrt{2}H_{c2}^{\text{orb}}/H^{p}, is equal to 4. This suggests that at low temperatures, the H_{c2} might be Pauli limited. With the current data up to 140 kOe that exceed the one-band BCS estimated Pauli limit, we see no clear sign of saturation of H_{c2}. Note

  that, with multiband as well as varying coupling strength, the Pauli limit can be different from a one-band BCS prediction. For example, in many Fe-based superconductors, H^{p} values are significantly enhanced [13].

The specific heat data from K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} are shown in Fig. 4. A clear jump in the specific heat at around 6 K corresponds to the superconducting transition. In the normal state, C=\gamma\,T+\beta\,T^{3} fits the data quite well. In the range of 7-10 K, we obtained a \gamma\sim 73 mJ/mol K^{2} and the Debye temperature \Theta_{D}, derived from \beta, is around 220 K. These data are consistent with recently reported values [1]. At the superconducting transition, the specific heat jump is roughly 2.2\gamma\,T_{c}. This is larger than the simple s-wave BCS prediction and comparable to the value obtained in Ref. [1]. Possibly, strong coupling is involved [14]. Below 1.5 K, we observe a clear upturn in C/T. Assuming that the normal state values of \gamma and \beta stay constant below T_{c}, this upturn exacerbates the difficulty of having entropy conserved, which was already hinted at in the previously reported data down to 2 K [1]. Additional, nonsuperconducting contributions, such as impurities or a nuclear Schottky anomaly, may be responsible for this low-temperature rise. But whatever its origin, it makes fitting of the data to specific models problematic.

At ambient pressure, the normal state dc magnetic susceptibility (\chi=M/H) is \sim0.9\times 10^{-3} emu/mol and decreases by more than 30% from 7 to 300 K (Fig. 5). If we fit these data to a Curie-Weiss law, we find a temperature-independent susceptibility \chi_{0}\sim 0.7\times 10^{-3} emu/mol, a small effective moment of 0.36\mu_{B}/R_{V}, for 0.21\mu_{B}/Cr), and a Curie-Weiss temperature \Theta\sim-40 K. At this point in time, it is not clear if such a local-moment fit is appropriate or intrinsic for this material. Given that \gamma=9 mJ/mol atom K^{2} is relatively high, it is appropriate to contrast it with the magnetic susceptibility. Assuming spin = 1/2, the estimated Wilson ratio [15]R_{W} is in a range of 0.9-1.1 by taking the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility value. If we consider the Curie tail as a result of an impurity contribution and thus take the value of temperature-independent \chi_{0}, R_{W} is about 0.7. These values

  are close to what one would expect for a Fermi-liquid system (R_{W}=1).

Zero-field-cooled dc magnetization data are shown in the right inset of Fig. 6. The superconducting transition appears sharply at 6.1 K, consistent with both resistance and specific heat measurements. To avoid oxidation, which could affect both sample mass and superconducting volume fraction, the sample mass was measured in a glove box and exposure to air was minimized.

At 2 K, the low-field M(H) data deviate from the linear field dependence at around 70 Oe (see the inset of Fig. 5). The minimum in magnetization appears at around 400 Oe. Taking H_{c1}=70 Oe and H_{c2}\sim H_{c2}^{\text{obs}}=312 kOe and using H_{c1}/H_{c2}=\ln(\kappa)/2\kappa^{2}, the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter \kappa is \sim100. From the specific heat jump at T_{c} using the Rutgers relation \Delta C/T_{c}=(1/8\pi\kappa^{2})(dH_{c2}/dT)^{2}|_{T_{c}}[16], we obtain a similar \kappa value of 116. This high value of \kappa suggests that K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} is deep in the type II regime.

The pressure dependence of T_{c} is plotted in Fig. 6. The superconducting transition of Pb was used to determine the pressure within the pressure cell [9]. As shown in the left inset of Fig. 6, both superconducting transitions from the Pb and the sample are clear. Up to 7 kbar, the T_{c} value for K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} decreases linearly with increasing pressure at a rate of -0.034 K/kbar. Given that the larger-unit-celled Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} undergoes a superconducting transition at a slightly lower temperature, 4.8 K, the effects of chemical and physical pressure are clearly not equivalent in this material.

In conclusion, we grew single crystals of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} using a high-temperature solution growth method. Being able to decant the molten solution at high temperature allows us to get relatively large, free-standing, high-quality single crystals, which also enables us to perform all of our measurements on single crystals or their arrays. In contrast to previously reported linear-temperature-dependent resistivity from 300 down to 7 K, the resistivity of a single crystal with a RRR of 50 (RRR \sim 10 for polycrystalline samples [1]) deviates from the linear temperature dependence below 100 K and roughly follows T^{3} over the range of 10-40 K. Whereas the differences between the single crystalline and polycrystalline sample transports are easily explained by grain-boundary scattering and potential resistive anisotropies, the rather clear T^{3} power law that we observe will require more experimental and theoretical investigations. Despite the fact that the temperature dependence is different, if the RRR values reflect the intrinsic quality of the samples, and are not due to grain-boundary scattering, the independence of T_{c} on the value of RRR, or impurity scattering, suggests a conventional mechanism of its superconductivity. Anisotropic H_{c2}(T) data up to 140 kOe were obtained from resistivity measurements. Up to 140 kOe, for field applied perpendicular to the rod, H_{c2}(T) is linear with a slope of -70 kOe/K. For field along the rod, dH_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}} is about -120 kOe/K. Above 70 kOe, the slope decreases to around -70 kOe/K. The T_{c} as well as the slope of H_{c2} is close to previously reported data [1]. The anisotropy in H_{c2} is not as large as one would generally expect for a Q1D superconductor. Virtually zero magnetoresistance was observed at temperatures right above the T_{c}. The electronic specific heat \gamma is 73 mJ/mol K^{2} or 9 mJ/mol atom K^{2}. Although this is a relatively large value, the equally enhanced magnetic susceptibility leads to a Wilson ratio that is close to 1 and suggests Fermi-liquid-like properties. At ambient pressure, H_{c1} is close to 70 Oe, which results in a GL parameter that is \sim100, taking 312 kOe as the estimated H_{c2}. For pressures up to 7 kbar, the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} decreases linearly with a rate of -0.034 K/kbar. Comparing to the newly discovered Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}, it seems to suggest that physical pressure and chemical pressure have different effects on the superconductivity in these compounds.

Despite the fact that K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} can be considered to be close to Q1D in a crystallographic sense, the "small" anisotropy in H_{c2} appears to suggest a rather three-dimensional nature. In addition, the exotic pairing symmetry requires more detailed study.
