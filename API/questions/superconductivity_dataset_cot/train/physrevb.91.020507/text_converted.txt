###### Abstract

We present a detailed study of single crystalline K₂Cr₃As₃ and analyze
its thermodynamic and transport properties, anisotropic H_(c2)(T), and
initial pressure dependence of T_(c). In zero field, the
temperature-dependent resistivity is metallic. Deviation from a linear
temperature dependence is evident below 100 K and a T³ dependence is
roughly followed from just above T_(c) (∼10 K) to ∼40 K. Anisotropic
H_(c2)(T) data were measured up to 140 kOe with field applied along and
perpendicular to the rodlike crystals. For the applied field
perpendicular to the rod, H_(c2)(T) is linear with a slope ∼−70 kOe/K.
For field applied along the rod, the slope is about −120 kOe/K below 70
kOe. Above 70 kOe, the magnitude of the slope decreases to ∼∼70 kOe/K.
The electronic specific heat coefficient γ, just above T_(c), is 73
mJ/mol K²; the Debye temperature Θ_(D) is 220 K. The specific heat jump
at the superconducting transition ΔC ∼ 2.2γT_(c). Finally, for
hydrostatic pressures up to ∼7 kbar, T_(c) decreases under pressure
linearly at a rate of −0.034K/kbar.

## 1 Introduction

K₂Cr₃As₃ has been recently discovered as a new superconducting material
with a T_(c) of 6.1 K [1]. Having a structure that contains (Cr₃As₃)²⁻
chains, it has quickly aroused interest as a potentially new
quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) superconductor. Related compounds, Rb₂Cr₃As₃
and Cs₂Cr₃As₃, with T_(c) values of about 4.8 and 2.2 K, respectively,
were reported soon after the discovery of K₂Cr₃As₃[2, 3]. Band structure
calculations were also conducted and compared with experimental results
[4]. In the initial report [1], data were acquired primarily on
polycrystalline samples of K₂Cr₃As₃. For Q1D superconductors, it is
believed that with a magnetic field applied along the chain, the upper
critical field H_(c2) should be much higher than that when the field is
along other directions due to minimized orbital pair breaking.
Experimentally, this was observed for Q1D systems such as
Li_(0.9)Mo_(0.0)O₁₇ and (TMTSF)ClO₄[5, 6]. In this Rapid Communication,
we present detailed anisotropic H_(c2)(T) data via resistance
measurements on K₂Cr₃As₃ single crystals. In addition, with the recent
discovery of the isostructural compound Rb₂Cr₃As₃, with a larger unit
cell and a lower T_(c) value, it is interesting to study the pressure
dependence of T_(c) of K₂Cr₃As₃. Results from low-field dc magnetization
measurements with pressures up to 7 kbar will be presented.

K₂Cr₃As₃ single crystals were grown using a high-temperature solution
growth method [7]. A schematic drawing of the Matryoshka-like ampoule
assembly for crystal synthesis is shown in Fig. 1(a). Elemental K, Cr,
and As [in bulk(lump) form] were packed in an alumina crucible following
the ratio listed in Ref. [1] (K:Cr:As = 6 : 1 : 7). The crucibles and
starting material were then welded into a tantalum tube and sealed in a
silica ampoule under a partial argon atmosphere. To avoid a possible
explosion due to the high vapor pressure of the unreacted elements, the
whole ampoule was slowly heated up to 1000 ^(∘)C over 2 days. It was
then cooled down over ∼100 h to 700 ^(∘)C, at which temperature the
single crystals and the remaining liquid were separated in a centrifuge
by the alumina strainer that was placed in between the growth side
crucible and an empty (catch) crucible. The crystals obtained are
rodlike [Fig. 1(b)] and malleable. A rough powder x-ray diffraction
pattern was collected on ground/deformed crystals using a Rigaku
Miniflex unit located in a N₂ glove box. The data, along with a fit to
the crystallographic data given in Ref. [1], are shown in Fig. 1(d) and
are consistent with the single crystals adopting the hexagonal, a =
9.983 A, c = 4.230 A unit cell. Given the unit cell dimensions and
single crystal morphology, we identify the rod direction as being along
the crystallographic c axis.

Resistance was measured using a standard four-probe technique. DuPont
4929N silver paint was used to attach platinum wires onto the sample in
a N₂ glove box. Electric current was applied along the rod for
anisotropic H_(c2) measurements [Fig. 1(c)]. Long, straight samples were
used and supported by flat plastic pads for all resistivity measurements
to avoid potential torque that could deform the crystals and thus change
their alignment. The resistivity was estimated assuming the sample has a
cylindrical shape. The absolute value of the resistivity is therefore
only accurate to within a factor of 3. The temperature- and
field-dependent resistance was measured in a Quantum Design (QD)
physical property measurement system, PPMS-14 (T = 1.8−305 K, H = 0−140
kOe). Specific heat data were measured using a QD PPMS via relaxation
method. A ³He option was utilized to obtain specific heat data down to
0.4 K. Specific heat data were measured on a "raft" assembled out of
several single crystals. Despite the fact that the samples’ shape and
arrangement were not ideal for such measurements, the coupling constant
was high, between 96

The pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature
T_(c) was determined via low-field (20 Oe), zero-field-cooled (ZFC), dc
magnetization measurements in a QD magnetic property measurement system
(MPMS) using a commercial (HMD) Be-Cu piston cylinder pressure cell [8].
Daphne oil 7373 was used as the pressure medium and Pb was used as the
manometer [9]. Since the samples are very air sensitive, exposure to air
was limited as much as possible to avoid oxidation.

The temperature dependence of the resistivity of K₂Cr₃As₃ is metallic,
as shown in Fig. 2. The residual resistance ratio (RRR) is about 50, a
factor of 5 better than the RRR ∼ 10 found for the polycrystalline data
[1]. A clear, sharp transition at 6.1 K indicates the superconducting
transition.

At room temperature, the resistivity is of the same order of magnitude
as the reported value [1]. However, in contrast to the reported linear
temperature dependence from 7 to 300 K in Ref. [1], we see a clear
deviation from linearity below ∼100 K. For the four samples we have
measured, we get slopes of 3.0, 2.8, 3.1, and 3.1 from a log(ρ − ρ₀) vs
log T plot between 10 and 40 K. Therefore, in the left inset of Fig. 2,
we plot the resistance data from several samples normalized to their
value at 40 K as a function of T³. It is clear that a T³ power law
describes these data well over the temperature region that is shown. The
slight deviation below 10 K might due to the proximity to the
superconducting transition. Although we did not see a temperature region
where Fermi-liquid behavior is dominant, this could be due to the fact
that the measurement temperature is not low enough as compared with its
Debye temperature. As will be discussed below, due to the extremely
large H_(c2) values associated with this compound, measuring normal
state resistivity to low temperatures will require extremely high
magnetic fields.

In the normal state, despite a relatively large RRR value, virtually no
magnetoresistance was observed. The right inset of Fig. 2 shows the
normalized resistance as a function of applied field for both transverse
(H ⊥ I) and longitudinal (H ∥ I) directions of the applied field. Right
above the T_(c), the resistance stays close to constant up to 140 kOe.
Given this null response, an upper limit of 2

Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the temperature-dependent resistance R(T)
measured under different magnetic fields for H∥ rod and H⊥ rod,
respectively. Figure 3(c) shows the anisotropic H_(c2)(T) data for
K₂Cr₃As₃ from several samples. The superconducting transition is very
sharp in our resistivity measurements. The inset to Fig. 3(c) shows
that, at over 125 kOe, the onsets and offsets of the transition differ
by less than 0.25 K as opposed to an over 0.6 K width at 80 kOe for
polycrystalline data [1]. An offset criterion [10] was used to determine
T_(c) [see the inset of Fig. 3(c)]. For field applied perpendicular to
the rod, the T_(c) decreases almost linearly with increasing magnetic
field. The slope is ∼−70 kOe/K. For field applied along the rod, the
initial slope is roughly −120 kOe/K, and above 70 kOe the slope is close
to −70 kOe/K, which is similar to that when field is applied
perpendicular to the rod. Different batches of samples as well as
field-sweep data at fixed temperature give consistent results. In Fig.
3(c), data from Ref. [1] are plotted as blue solid diamonds. It is close
to what we obtained for field perpendicular to the rod and the slope is
consistent with our current results.

From one-band BCS theory, for an s-wave, isotropic material, in the
clean limit, the orbital H_(c2)^(orb) = −0.73|dH_(c2)/dT|_(T)T_(c)[11].
In our case, for field perpendicular to the rod, H_(c2)^(orb) ∼ 312 kOe.
The Pauli limit for a simple BCS superconductor is
H^(p) = 1.84T_(c) = 110 kOe. The H_(c2) of real systems will be
influenced by both H_(c2)^(orb) and H^(p). The Maki parameter [12] that
describes the relative importance of the two critical field limits,
$\alpha=\sqrt{2}H_{c2}^{\text{orb}}/H^{p}$, is equal to 4. This suggests
that at low temperatures, the H_(c2) might be Pauli limited. With the
current data up to 140 kOe that exceed the one-band BCS estimated Pauli
limit, we see no clear sign of saturation of H_(c2). Note

that, with multiband as well as varying coupling strength, the Pauli
limit can be different from a one-band BCS prediction. For example, in
many Fe-based superconductors, H^(p) values are significantly enhanced
[13].

The specific heat data from K₂Cr₃As₃ are shown in Fig. 4. A clear jump
in the specific heat at around 6 K corresponds to the superconducting
transition. In the normal state, C = γ T + β T³ fits the data quite
well. In the range of 7-10 K, we obtained a γ ∼ 73 mJ/mol K² and the
Debye temperature Θ_(D), derived from β, is around 220 K. These data are
consistent with recently reported values [1]. At the superconducting
transition, the specific heat jump is roughly 2.2γ T_(c). This is larger
than the simple s-wave BCS prediction and comparable to the value
obtained in Ref. [1]. Possibly, strong coupling is involved [14]. Below
1.5 K, we observe a clear upturn in C/T. Assuming that the normal state
values of γ and β stay constant below T_(c), this upturn exacerbates the
difficulty of having entropy conserved, which was already hinted at in
the previously reported data down to 2 K [1]. Additional,
nonsuperconducting contributions, such as impurities or a nuclear
Schottky anomaly, may be responsible for this low-temperature rise. But
whatever its origin, it makes fitting of the data to specific models
problematic.

At ambient pressure, the normal state dc magnetic susceptibility
(χ = M/H) is ∼0.9 × 10⁻³ emu/mol and decreases by more than 30

are close to what one would expect for a Fermi-liquid system
(R_(W) = 1).

Zero-field-cooled dc magnetization data are shown in the right inset of
Fig. 6. The superconducting transition appears sharply at 6.1 K,
consistent with both resistance and specific heat measurements. To avoid
oxidation, which could affect both sample mass and superconducting
volume fraction, the sample mass was measured in a glove box and
exposure to air was minimized.

At 2 K, the low-field M(H) data deviate from the linear field dependence
at around 70 Oe (see the inset of Fig. 5). The minimum in magnetization
appears at around 400 Oe. Taking H_(c1) = 70 Oe and
H_(c2) ∼ H_(c2)^(obs) = 312 kOe and using H_(c1)/H_(c2) = ln (κ)/2κ²,
the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter κ is ∼100. From the specific heat
jump at T_(c) using the Rutgers relation
ΔC/T_(c) = (1/8πκ²)(dH_(c2)/dT)²|_(T_(c))[16], we obtain a similar κ
value of 116. This high value of κ suggests that K₂Cr₃As₃ is deep in the
type II regime.

The pressure dependence of T_(c) is plotted in Fig. 6. The
superconducting transition of Pb was used to determine the pressure
within the pressure cell [9]. As shown in the left inset of Fig. 6, both
superconducting transitions from the Pb and the sample are clear. Up to
7 kbar, the T_(c) value for K₂Cr₃As₃ decreases linearly with increasing
pressure at a rate of −0.034 K/kbar. Given that the larger-unit-celled
Rb₂Cr₃As₃ undergoes a superconducting transition at a slightly lower
temperature, 4.8 K, the effects of chemical and physical pressure are
clearly not equivalent in this material.

In conclusion, we grew single crystals of K₂Cr₃As₃ using a
high-temperature solution growth method. Being able to decant the molten
solution at high temperature allows us to get relatively large,
free-standing, high-quality single crystals, which also enables us to
perform all of our measurements on single crystals or their arrays. In
contrast to previously reported linear-temperature-dependent resistivity
from 300 down to 7 K, the resistivity of a single crystal with a RRR of
50 (RRR ∼ 10 for polycrystalline samples [1]) deviates from the linear
temperature dependence below 100 K and roughly follows T³ over the range
of 10-40 K. Whereas the differences between the single crystalline and
polycrystalline sample transports are easily explained by grain-boundary
scattering and potential resistive anisotropies, the rather clear T³
power law that we observe will require more experimental and theoretical
investigations. Despite the fact that the temperature dependence is
different, if the RRR values reflect the intrinsic quality of the
samples, and are not due to grain-boundary scattering, the independence
of T_(c) on the value of RRR, or impurity scattering, suggests a
conventional mechanism of its superconductivity. Anisotropic H_(c2)(T)
data up to 140 kOe were obtained from resistivity measurements. Up to
140 kOe, for field applied perpendicular to the rod, H_(c2)(T) is linear
with a slope of −70 kOe/K. For field along the rod, dH_(c2)/dT|_(T_(c))
is about −120 kOe/K. Above 70 kOe, the slope decreases to around −70
kOe/K. The T_(c) as well as the slope of H_(c2) is close to previously
reported data [1]. The anisotropy in H_(c2) is not as large as one would
generally expect for a Q1D superconductor. Virtually zero
magnetoresistance was observed at temperatures right above the T_(c).
The electronic specific heat γ is 73 mJ/mol K² or 9 mJ/mol atom K².
Although this is a relatively large value, the equally enhanced magnetic
susceptibility leads to a Wilson ratio that is close to 1 and suggests
Fermi-liquid-like properties. At ambient pressure, H_(c1) is close to 70
Oe, which results in a GL parameter that is ∼100, taking 312 kOe as the
estimated H_(c2). For pressures up to 7 kbar, the superconducting
transition temperature T_(c) decreases linearly with a rate of −0.034
K/kbar. Comparing to the newly discovered Rb₂Cr₃As₃, it seems to suggest
that physical pressure and chemical pressure have different effects on
the superconductivity in these compounds.

Despite the fact that K₂Cr₃As₃ can be considered to be close to Q1D in a
crystallographic sense, the "small" anisotropy in H_(c2) appears to
suggest a rather three-dimensional nature. In addition, the exotic
pairing symmetry requires more detailed study.
