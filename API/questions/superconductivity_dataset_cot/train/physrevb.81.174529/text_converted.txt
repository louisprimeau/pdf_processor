## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity above 50 K in iron pnictides has
posed a strong impact in the community of condensed matter physics.[1]
One of the key issues here is about the superconducting pairing
mechanism. Theoretically it was suggested that the pairing may be
established via interpocket scattering of electrons between the hole
pockets (around Γ point) and electron pockets (around M point), leading
to the pairing manner of an isotropic gap on each pocket but with
opposite signs between them (the so-called S^(±)).[2, 3, 4, 5] Meanwhile
other models adopt the S^(±) pairing gap but assume that the pairing
interaction is established via the local magnetic superexchange.[6, 7]
Besides, by varying the height of the pnictogen to the Fe planes, it was
argued that the pairing symmetry may be switched from S^(±) to d-wave
pairing,[8] as corroborated by the data in LaFePO where a nodal gap was
inferred from the penetration depth measurements.[9, 10] Similarly,
experimental results about the pairing symmetry remain highly
controversial leaving the perspectives ranging from S⁺ wave, to S^(±)
and to d wave.[9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] Further
comprehension to this essential topic is highly desired.

In a superconductor, the disorder induced impurity scattering and pair
breaking strongly depend on the very details of the pairing gap,
therefore it is informative to detect the disorder scattering effect in
the superconducting state. According to the Anderson’s theorem,[21] in a
conventional s-wave superconductor, nonmagnetic impurities will not lead
to apparent pair-breaking effect. However, a magnetic impurity, owing to
the effect of breaking the time reversal symmetry, can break Cooper
pairs easily. In sharp contrast, in a d-wave superconductor, nonmagnetic
impurities can significantly alter the pairing interaction and induce a
high density of states (DOS) due to the sign change of the gap on a
Fermi surface. This was indeed observed in cuprate superconductors where
Zn-doping induces T_(c) suppression as strong as other magnetic
disorders, such as Mn and Ni.[22] As for the pairing through exchanging
the AF spin fluctuations between different Fermi pockets with the S^(±)
pairing, it has been pointed out that nonmagnetic impurities could
severely suppress T_(c) and the gap.[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]
In this paper, we report the doping effect of Mn and Zn to the Fe sites
of superconductor Ba_(0.5)K_(0.5)Fe₂As₂. We found that the Mn doping
(leading to the magnetic impurities) depresses T_(c) drastically, while
the impurity scattering and suppression to T_(c) by Zn doping
(nonmagnetic scattering centers) is negligible. The contrasting impurity
scattering effects as revealed by our results need to be reconciled with
the theoretical expectations of the picture of interpocket scattering
via exchanging AF spin fluctuations.

## II Experimental

The Mn-doped and Zn-doped polycrystalline samples
Ba_(0.5)K_(0.5)(Fe_(1 − x)TM_(x))₂As₂ (TM=Mn and Zn) were fabricated by
solid state reaction method.[32] Powders K₃As, FeAs, BaAs, ZnAs, and
MnAs were prepared previously as precursors. The samples with different
doping concentrations were pressed into pellets under the same pressure,
wrapped in Ta foils and sintered under exactly the same conditions to
eliminate the possible errors in the sample-making process. The x-ray
diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed using an MXP18A-HF-type
diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The analysis of x-ray diffraction
data was done by using the softwares powder-x and fullprof, the obtained
results are consistent with each other. The compositions of the samples
were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4200) and
the energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX, Oxford-6566). The
susceptibility measurements were carried out through an Oxford cryogenic
system Maglab-EXA-12. The resistivity, magnetoresistance, and Hall
effect were measured with a Quantum Design instrument physical property
measurement system (PPMS), and the dc magnetization by a Quantum Design
instrument superconducting quantum interference device (MPMS-7).

## III Results

### Magnetic and resistive transitions

In Fig. 1(a), we show the temperature dependence of resistivity of the
Mn-doped samples Ba_(0.5)K_(0.5)(Fe_(1 − x)Mn_(x))₂As₂ One can see that
the superconducting transition temperature was suppressed quickly upon
the doping of Mn, and the superconductivity vanishes in the sample with
x = 0.08. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 1(b), the Zn-doped sample does
not exhibit a clear change of _Tc_ with the nominal doping concentration
as high as x = 0.10. The Zn-doping effect in the iron pnictide has been
under a heavy debate. It was found by Li _et al._[33] that the Zn doping
to the Fe sites in LaFeAsO does not change _Tc_ clearly. However, also
in the Zn doped but high pressure synthesized LaFeAsO samples, Guo _et
al._[34] found that the superconductivity can be destroyed completely at
a very low doping level of 2

### Structure and composition

In order to know whether the Zn impurities are really introduced into
the lattice, we have carried out detailed analysis on the compositions
of the grains in each sample using the EDX analysis. The undoped sample
Ba0.5K0.5Fe2As2 exhibits superconductivity at about _Tc_ = 35 K,
combining with the lattice constants,[32] we conclude that our sample is
slightly overdoped. The EDX data reveal that the actual doping levels of
Mn is very close to the nominal composition up to 8

of the Ba0.5K0.5(Fe1−,Mn)2As2 samples measured with _H_xe=0.1 Oe and f =
333 Hz. (b) Temperature dependence of ac susceptibility of the
Ba0.5K0.5(Fe1−,Zn)2As2 samples measured with the same conditions as the
Mn-doped sample.

Figure 1: (Color online) (a) Temperature dependence of resistivity of
the Ba0.5K0.5(Fe1−,Mn)2As2 samples under zero field. It is clear that
the superconducting transition is depressed drastically by doping Mn.
(b) Temperature dependence of resistivity of the Ba0.5K0.5(Fe1−,Zn)2As2
samples under zero field. The depression to the superconducting
transition by Zn doping is negligible. The inset in (b) shows the
enlarged part in the low temperature region. The dashed lines are
extrapolation of the normal state data to T = 0 K. It is remarkable that
the undoped sample has exactly a zero residual resistivity.

Above discussion can be corroborated by the characterization of the XRD
data. The XRD patterns for all samples were shown in Figs. 4(a) and
4(b). For Mn-doped ones, one can see that the phase is rather clean and
no impurities could be detected up to x = 0.08. The lattice constants of
a axis and the cell volume increase monotonically with doping of Mn [as
shown in Fig. 4(c)], which indicates that the Mn atoms were successfully
introduced into the lattice. Assuming that the Mn ionic state is "+2,"
since the ionic radius of Mn2+(0.8 A) is bigger than that of Fe2+(0.74
A), it is understandable that the in-plane lattice constant expands and
the unit cell volume increases about 1.6

### **C. Hall effect, magnetoresistance, and magnetizations**

It order to know what has been carried out microscopically through
doping Mn and Zn in our samples, we measured the Hall coefficient R_(H),
Magnetoresistance (MR) and dc magnetization. As shown in Fig. 5(a),
R_(H) is positive in the undoped sample, indicating hole dominant
conduction in Ba0.5K0.5Fe2As5. As we dope Mn into the sample and keep
increasing the doped content, the R_(H) reduces systematically. This can
be explained by introducing more holes into the system through Mn
doping, though complexity will be brought in understanding the Hall data
of the multiband system.[35] Actually doping Mn induces similar effect
as doping Cr.[36] The temperature dependence of R_(H) is also shown for
the Zn-doped sample (_x_ = 0.06, 0.08) in Fig. 5(a). One can see that
the data of Zn-doped sample overlap roughly with the undoped one in a
broad temperature region, indicating that the Zn2+ is almost identical
to Fe2+ in donating electrons. Figure 5(b) presents the MR of the
Mn-doped sample with x = 0.08, a clear negative MR effect was observed
at low temperatures. This negative MR can be easily understood as due to
the enhanced electron-spin scattering: doping Mn induces more and more
magnetic centers which have stronger magnetic moment compared to that of
Fe2+. This argument is supported by the enhanced magnetic susceptibility
in the Mn-doped samples. As shown in the inset of Fig. 5(b), the
temperature dependence of dc magnetization of the Mn-doped sample can be
described nicely by the Curie-Weiss law x = _kh_0+_C/(_T_ + T_(N)) with
C = m0_m_d_2/3_k__B_, yielding m_(J) = 0.482_m_d_2/(Fe) in the undoped
sample, 0.645_m_d_2/(Fe + Mn) in the Mn-doped (_x_ = 0.08) sample,
0.362_m_d_2/(Fe + Zn) in the

Zn-doped (_x_ = 0.04) sample. Assuming that each Fe site has also
0.482_m__B_ in the Mn-doped sample, then each Mn site contributes about
2.58_m__B_. Zn-doped sample naturally lowers down the paramagnetic
susceptibility, suggesting that nonmagnetic impurities have been formed.
Although it is still under debate whether the AF order is due to the
localized moment or itinerant electrons, it is qualitatively correct to
make an assessment that the increase of the value of constant "C" in the
Curie-Weiss law could be attributed to the enhancement of local magnetic
moments upon Mn doping, this argument is also consistent with the
negative magnetoresistivity data (Kondo-like scattering).

## IV Discussion

Finally we summarize the main results in Fig. 6. For Mn-doped samples,
as the doping concentration increases, T_(c) decreases quickly with a
rate of D_T__c_/Mn-1

One may argue that the weak suppression to T_(c) in the Zn-doped samples
is due to the weak impurity scattering effect (which is actually also
very intriguing), however, even taking this small change of r0 in the
Zn-doped samples and assuming the same suppression rate D_T__c_/D_r_0 of
the Mn-doped system, we should have a 3.4 K drop of T_(c) at the doping
level of 10

Figure 5: (Color online) (a) Temperature dependence of Hall coefficient
R_(H) = _ρ__xy_/_H_ measured at 9 T for the undoped, three Mn-doped, and
two Zn-doped samples. One can see that by doping more Mn into the system
the positive Hall coefficient R_(H) becomes smaller, indicating the
doping of holes into the system. While Zn doping does not change the
Hall coefficient too much. (b) MR of the Mn-doped samples, a negative MR
was observed here. Inset of (b) shows the temperature dependence of dc
magnetization of the undoped, Mn-doped and Zn-doped sample. The _M_(_t_)
relation can be described by the Curie-Weiss law (see text).

Figure 6: (Color online) Doping dependence of T_(c) and _ρ_0 in Mn- and
Zn-doped samples. The suppression to T_(c) in Mn-doped samples is
drastic, but that by Zn doping is negligible. The enhancement of _ρ_0 is
much weaker in the Zn-doped sample as compared with the Mn-doped one.
The blue dashed line indicates the T_(c) drop for the Zn-doped samples
if we adopt the simple relation

magnetic disorders in iron pnictide may suggest that these dopants all
act as impurity scatters with small momentum transfer. By changing the
doping level, once this scattering vector in the momentum space is as
large as the interpocket vector, we shall see a strong pair-breaking
effect, although it is nonmagnetic. It is very worthwhile to check this
interesting scenario.

Before concluding the paper, we should mention another interesting
discovery in our data. It is found that
[ρ(T, x) − ρ(0, x)]/[ρ(300  K, x) − ρ(0, x)] is doping independent in
all temperature regions and all data with different doping levels can be
nicely scaled (see Fig. 7). This indicates that, in the single band
approach, the [m^(*)(x)/τ(x, T)n(x, T)e²]/[m^(*)(0)/τ(0, T)n(0, T)e²] is
temperature independent. Regarding the similar temperature dependence of
all the curves, we would assume that 1/τ(x) ≈ 1/τ(0), therefore the
temperature independent scaling is due to the electron-boson coupling
strength λ in terms of the effective mass relation M^(*)(x) =
[1 + λM^(*)(0)]. Suppose that adding Zn has two effects: (1) adding
impurity scattering and (2) changing the coupling strength with spin
fluctuations (bosons here). The latter assumption is pretty logical in
view of the strong effect of Zn on the magnetic properties of the parent
compound. If this is true, Zn doping may enhance the superconducting
pairing, but unfortunately it is offset by its pair-breaking effect as
an impurity. It is very worthwhile to check whether this scaling holds
also in other systems.

## V V. Concluding remarks

We fabricated and measured the resistivity, Hall effect,
magnetoresistance, and dc magnetization in Mn- and Zn-doped
Ba_(0.5)K_(0.3)Fe₂As₂ samples. The Mn-doping enhances the residual
resistivity and suppresses the superconducting transition temperature
drastically. Further analysis indicates that the Mn doping induces
strong local magnetic moments (∼2.58μ_(B)) which play as pair breakers.
The impurity scattering measured by the residual resistivity ρ₀ in the
Zn-doped samples is very weak, accompanied by a negligible suppression
to T_(c). A possible explanation is that the impurity scattering by the
Zn impurities are mainly small angle scattering (or small momentum
transfer), therefore it cannot break the pairing given by the
interpocket scattering. Finally we found a scaling of the normal state
resistivity: [ρ(T, x) − ρ(0, x)]/[ρ(300  K, x) − ρ(0, x)]. This is
explained as the enhancement of the coupling strength between electrons
and the spin fluctuations induced by the Zn doping.
