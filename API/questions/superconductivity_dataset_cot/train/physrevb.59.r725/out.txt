###### Abstract

We have measured the static magnetic susceptibility and the resistivity of Zn (0 <= z <= 0.25) and Sr (0 <= x < 0.03) doped La2CuO4. Our data clearly show that Zn impurities lead to an increase of the Neel temperature T_{N} in weakly hole doped compounds. This increase of T_{N} correlates with an increase of the resistivity. The analysis of our data strongly suggests that the hole mobility is the most important source for the strong suppression of antiferromagnetic order in La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4. [S0163-1829(99)50102-1]

Doping of the parent compounds of high-temperature superconductors with charge carriers has a pronounced influence on both the antiferromagnetic (AF) order and the electronic transport properties. La2CuO4 for example is an insulator with AF order below a Neel temperature of T_{N}^{0}\sim 300 K.1 In La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 (LSCO) this long-range magnetic order is almost completely destroyed by doping the CuO2 planes with the small amount of ~2 % holes (_x_ ~ 0.02).2 In contrast, a much weaker influence on the magnetic order is observed when the Cu spin lattice is diluted by nonmagnetic Zn ions.3 In case an impurity content as large as 30-40% is required to destroy the AF order which is in fair agreement with the theoretical predictions by the site percolation theory for a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice.4 In contrast the situation is less clear in the case of doping with charge carriers. While it is well known that doped holes strongly disturb the antiferromagnetic bonds in the CuO2 planes5 and that there is a strong coupling between the hole motion and the AF correlations, the detailed mechanism of the rapid suppression of T_{N} upon hole doping is poorly understood. It has been argued that the strong suppression of AF order in lightly hole doped La2CuO4 is related to a segregation of the holes into quasi-one-dimensional, antiphase domain boundaries which lead to an in-plane anisotropy of the magnetic exchange.6,7 A similar scenario has been recently derived from a comparative study of Sr- and Li-doped La2CuO4.8 In particular, it was pointed out in this study that the magnetic properties do not correlate with the electrical transport properties.8 Based on this observation it is argued that the strong suppression of AF order is caused by the motion of AF domains which are surrounded by charged, antiphase boundaries, i.e., due to collective hole phenomena.8

We have investigated in more detail the relationship between hole mobility and antiferromagnetic order by measuring the magnetic and electronic transport properties of La2CuO4 doped by both Sr and Zn in the AF phase. Here, the Zn doping is used to reduce the mobility of the holes introduced by the Sr doping. Our data show a clear correlation between the degree of the hole localization and the magnetic ordering temperature T_{N}. In particular, we find that Zn doping increases T_{N} in lightly hole doped La2CuO4 due to the localization of the charge carriers.

Using a standard solid state reaction9 four series of polycrystalline La2-_x_Sr_xCu1-_z_Zn_O4 samples with different nominal compositions were prepared: one with a fixed Sr content (_x_ = 0.017) and various Zn doping (0 <= z <= 0.25), and another with a fixed Zn concentration (_z_ = 0.15) and various Sr doping (0 <= z <= 0.03). For comparison we show in addition results on La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 and La2Cu1-_z_Zn_O4, i.e., samples doped either with Sr (0 <= x <= 0.023) or with Zn (0 <= z <= 0.25). To reduce the excess oxygen all samples have been annealed for 72 h at 625 degC in pure N2 atmosphere. Within a series of samples with identical x (_z_) the differences of the Sr (Zn) content are smaller than \Delta x\sim +- 0.001 (\Delta z\sim +- 0.01). In order to obtain this necessary accuracy of the Sr content, a complete series of samples with different z was prepared from the same mixture of La2O3 and SrCO3. The error of x was checked by measuring T_{N} of different samples with identical compositions (e.g., for z = 0).

At low temperatures all investigated samples (_x_ <= 0.03) are insulators. It is well established that the electrical resistivity in this nonmetallic regime is described within the variable range hopping (VRH) model as \rho(T)\propto exp((_T_{0}/T)^{\alpha}), where T0 is a characteristic temperature controlled by the mobility of the holes and the exponent a depends on the dimensionality of the VRH process.10 As shown in Fig. 1 the resistivity r of La1.98Sr0.017Cu1-_z_Zn_O4 is well described assuming an exponent a = 1/3 which corresponds to a two

 -dimensional hopping at elevated temperatures [11]. The general trend of \rho(x,z) as a function of doping is an increase with decreasing x and increasing z, respectively. In the case of 2D VRH the characteristic temperature T_{0} is related to the localization radius r_{loc} of the holes via

\[T_{0}\!=\!\frac{13.8}{k_{B}N(\bm{\epsilon}_{F})r_{loc}^{2}},\] (1)

where N(\bm{\epsilon}_{F}) is the density of states at the Fermi energy [10]. Measurements of the electronic specific heat yield that N(\bm{\epsilon}_{F}) does not vary significantly in the doping regime of our experiments [12]. Therefore, we neglect a possible weak dependence of N(\bm{\epsilon}_{F}) on x and z in our qualitative discussion of the localization radius r_{loc}.

The values for T_{0}^{1/3} and the normalized localization radius r_{loc} are summarized in Fig. 2. Let us first focus on the data obtained for La_{1.985}Sr_{0.017}Cu_{1-\cdot}Zn_{0}O_{4} shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). A clear increase of T_{0}, i.e., an increasing localization, is observed with increasing Zn doping. The localization radius r_{loc} determined from T_{0} using Eq. (1) strongly decreases with increasing z and saturates for Zn doping z\approx 0.15.

The corresponding results for T_{0} and r_{loc} for the samples with fixed Zn content z\!=\!0.15 and variable Sr concentration x\!\approx\!0.03 are shown in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d) (full symbols). With increasing Sr content T_{0}^{1/3} (r_{loc}) decreases (increases), i.e., the holes become more mobile. However, we stress that for this high Zn content r_{loc} stays small even for the largest Sr doping (x\!=\!0.03). Indeed, our findings for z\!=\!0.15 markedly differ from the behavior in pure La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} , i.e., for z\!=\!0, which is also shown in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d) (open symbols). In the latter case there is a much stronger increase of the hole mobility (r_{loc}) with increasing x.

In the following we will show that this strong influence of the Zn doping on the hole mobility as revealed from our resistivity data clearly correlates with the magnetic properties. In Fig. 3 the magnetic susceptibility \chi is plotted for some representative La_{1.985}Sr_{0.017}Cu_{1-\cdot}Zn_{0}O_{4} samples with a fixed Sr content x\!=\!0.017 and different Zn concentrations (0\!\leq\!z\!\leq\!0.25). The susceptibilities are similar to that of the canted antiferromagnet La_{2}CuO_{4}[13]. The paramagnetic state at high temperatures is characterized by a Curie-Weiss-like increase of \chi with decreasing T, followed by a well defined peak which indicates the transition to AF order at T_{N}. At very low temperature a Curie-like upturn due to small amounts of paramagnetic moments (e.g., uncompensated Cu spins) is visible. Without Zn doping, T_{N}\!=\!125 K is observed which is significantly below T_{N} of pure La_{2}CuO_{4} due to the Sr doping (x\!=\!0.017). The remarkable feature of Fig. 3 is the fact that additional Zn doping initially does not lead to a further reduction of T_{N}. In contrast, T_{N} even increases up to T_{N}\!=\!144 K for z\!=\!0.05. Only for z\!>\!0.05, T_{N} starts to decrease again. Note that a large Zn concentration of z\!\approx\!0.1 is required to reach T_{N}\!=\!125 K measured for z\!=\!0.

A similar study of the influence of Zn doping on T_{N} has been performed for x\!=\!0, i.e., for samples without doped holes. A comparison of the T_{N} obtained for these two sets of samples is given in the phase diagram shown in Fig. 3(a). For x\!=\!0, the well-known linear decrease of T_{N}(z) with increasing z is observed. The distinction to our findings for the lightly hole doped compounds is apparent. However, note

The dotted line is a guide to the eye to emphasize the nonmonotonous dependence of T_{N} on Zn doping. The curves are displaced vertically by 1\!\times\!10^{-4} emu/mol for clarity.

The solid lines are guides to the eye. Values for La_{2}Cu_{0.98}Li_{0.02}O_{4} ( \Diamond ) are extracted from \rho(T) data in Ref. [14].

  that this difference reduces with increasing Zn content. Indeed, for large Zn contents z\geq0.15 the slope dT_{N}/dz is about the same for the two sets of samples. Thus, it is evident from the measured T_{N}(z) dependences that for the hole doped samples with x= 0.017 there is a kind of threshold value z\sim 0.15 for the Zn doping. Above this value T_{N} is consistent with a simple spin dilution, whereas for smaller Zn doping there is an apparently different mechanism controlling T_{N} for compounds with a finite hole content.

To obtain further insight into the effect of Zn and Sr doping on T_{N} in La_{2}CuO_{4} we have studied the susceptibility of samples with a fixed Zn content z= 0.15 and various Sr concentrations in the range 0<x< 0.03. The Neel temperatures of these samples monotonously decrease with increasing x as shown in Fig. 4(b) (full symbols). A quite remarkable result is obtained when comparing these findings to the well-known T_{N}(x) dependence of samples without Zn doping [open symbols in Fig. 4(b)]. In the absence of holes, i.e., for x= 0, T_{N} is much smaller in the Zn-doped compound as expected due to the dilution of the Cu spin system. However, the decrease of T_{N} with increasing Sr concentration is much weaker in the Zn-doped compounds and, finally, T_{N} of these samples is significantly larger than for the samples without Zn doping. The extrapolated critical Sr content for which T_{N}= 0 is as large as x_{c}\approx 0.033 for z= 0.15 and therefore clearly exceeds the corresponding value x_{c}= 0.02 of samples without Zn. A comparison of these experimental findings for T_{N} in Fig. 4(b) to the results of the resistivity measurements on the same samples shown in Fig. 2(d) indicates a relationship between T_{N} and r_{loc}; a strong decrease of T_{N} with increasing x seems to correlate with a strong increase of r_{loc} which is only present for z= 0.

In order to clarify this relationship between r_{loc} and T_{N} we consider again the series of Zn-doped samples with a fixed Sr content of x= 0.017. Both, the resistivity and the susceptibility data strongly suggest that one has to distinguish two regimes of Zn doping. There is a strong doping regime for z\geq 0.15 where the degree of localization does not change significantly as a function of the Zn content, i.e., the mobility of holes is already reduced to its minimum. In this doping regime T_{N} decreases linearly with the Zn content z which can be interpreted in terms of simple spin dilution. In contrast to that, the charge mobility is strongly affected by the Zn doping in the weak doping regime z\leq 0.15 as signaled by the strong decrease of r_{loc} in Fig. 2(b). In the same range of doping the unusual nonmonotonous change of T_{N} as a function of the Zn content is observed [see Fig. 4(a)]. Hence, in the low doping regime Zn doping plays a twofold role. On the one hand it reduces T_{N} due to the creation of static spin holes in the Cu spin lattice (spin dilution). However, on the other hand it causes a localization of the mobile holes thus reducing the effect of Sr doping on the AF order. The superconducting of these two effects causes the nonmonotonous change of T_{N} with increasing z.

Subtracting the effect of spin dilution which is known from the findings for La_{2}Cu_{1-x}.Zn_{x}O_{4} (as well as from the high Zn doping regime for x= 0.017) allows to determine the suppression of T_{N} due to the mobility of the holes. The result is plotted in Fig. 5 which shows T_{N}^{\rm Sr}=T_{N}(x,z)+[T_{N}^{0}-T_{N}(0,z)] as a function of the Zn content z for the samples with x= 0.017. Here, T_{N}^{0}= 292 K is the Neel temperature of pure La_{2}CuO_{4} and T_{N}^{\rm Sr} is the Neel temperature corrected for the influence of the dilution of the Cu spin lattice due to Zn doping. That is, T_{N}^{\rm Sr} represents the ordering temperature of "hypothetical" exclusively Sr-doped samples (x= 0.017) with different degree of hole mobility as measured by r_{loc}. From a comparison of T_{N}^{\rm Sr} and r_{loc} in Fig. 5 the crucial role of the hole mobility for suppression of AF order becomes apparent. The strong _reduction of r_{loc}_ at small z corresponds well with a respective steep _increase of T_{N}^{\rm Sr}_ by more than 100

Error bars show the scatter of T_{N} for different samples with identical nominal compositions.

Samples marked with (\Diamond) are additionally doped by Eu which is irrelevant in the context of this paper.

  K. In the limit of strong localization (large z) both T_{N}^{\rm Sr}(z) and r_{loc}(z) tend to saturate. However, note that T_{N}^{\rm Sr} is still by about 40-50 K less than T_{N}^{0} as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 5. According to our analysis this remaining difference has to be attributed to the decrease of T_{N} due to quasistatic holes. This suppression which amounts to about 40-50 K for x = 0.017 is still about three times stronger than that for a Zn content of z = 0.017 in La_{2}Cu_{1-z}Zn_{x}O_{4}. The reason for this stronger influence is obvious, since a doped hole on an oxygen site does not only dilute the spin lattice, but also causes a ferromagnetic exchange between the adjacent Cu spins.[5] Nevertheless, only a small part of the decrease of T_{N} in LSCO can be explained with the presence of quasistatic holes. For a Sr content x = 0.017 this fraction amounts to about 1/4 of the total suppression (see inset of Fig. 5). Therefore our data show that the charge mobility plays the most significant role in destruction of the AF order in LSCO with increasing x.

This main conclusion of our study seems to contradict the above-mentioned findings on Li-doped La_{2}CuO_{4}.[8] However, also for Li hole doping the resistivity decreases strongly for small concentrations.[14] From the resistivity data in Ref. 14 we have estimated T_{0} and r_{loc} for a Li content of 2%. The results are included in Fig. 2. As expected the holes are less mobile than in LSCO. However, the localization radius in the Li-doped compound is significantly larger than in the case of quasistatic holes for high Zn contents. Accordingly, La_{2}Cu_{1-y}Li_{y}O_{4} should be compared to La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-z}Zn_{x}O_{4} at intermediate Zn doping, where charge mobility is still the main source of the suppressed T_{N}. From the correlation between T_{N}^{\rm Sr} and r_{loc} for the 1.7% Sr-doped samples shown in Fig. 5 or r_{loc} of the 2% Li-doped compound we estimate a Neel temperature of T_{N}\simeq 175 K. This value is in fair agreement with the measurements revealing T_{N}\simeq 140 K.[14] if we take into account the slightly larger hole content in the Li-doped sample, i.e., 2% instead of 1.7%. This agreement strongly confirms our data analysis in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-z}Zn_{x}O_{4} and, moreover, gives further experimental evidence for a correlation between transport and magnetic properties in lightly hole doped La_{2}CuO_{4}. In this respect our findings do not support the conclusions in Ref. 8. According to our results there is no apparent contradiction to the assumption that the mobility of individual holes determines both the electrical resistivity and the suppression of the magnetic order.

In summary, the investigation of the static magnetic susceptibility and the electrical resistivity of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-z}Zn_{x}O_{4} has revealed a clear correlation between the antiferromagnetic ordering and the mobility of the holes in these compounds. Localizing the holes by Zn doping increases T_{N} and finally leads to a situation which is similar to that in La_{2}Cu_{1-z}Zn_{x}O_{4} where the AF order is only suppressed due to the dilution of the Cu spin lattice. From our data we conclude that the hole mobility is the most important source for the strong suppression of AF order in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}.

###### Abstract

We have measured the static magnetic susceptibility and the resistivity of Zn (0 <= z <= 0.25) and Sr (0 <= x < 0.03) doped La2CuO4. Our data clearly show that Zn impurities lead to an increase of the Neel temperature T_{N} in weakly hole doped compounds. This increase of T_{N} correlates with an increase of the resistivity. The analysis of our data strongly suggests that the hole mobility is the most important source for the strong suppression of antiferromagnetic order in La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4. [S0163-1829(99)50102-1]

Doping of the parent compounds of high-temperature superconductors with charge carriers has a pronounced influence on both the antiferromagnetic (AF) order and the electronic transport properties. La2CuO4 for example is an insulator with AF order below a Neel temperature of T_{N}^{0}\sim 300 K.1 In La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 (LSCO) this long-range magnetic order is almost completely destroyed by doping the CuO2 planes with the small amount of ~2 % holes (_x_ ~ 0.02).2 In contrast, a much weaker influence on the magnetic order is observed when the Cu spin lattice is diluted by nonmagnetic Zn ions.3 In case an impurity content as large as 30-40% is required to destroy the AF order which is in fair agreement with the theoretical predictions by the site percolation theory for a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice.4 In contrast the situation is less clear in the case of doping with charge carriers.

We have investigated in more detail the relationship between hole mobility and antiferromagnetic order by measuring the magnetic and electronic transport properties of La2CuO4 doped by both Sr and Zn in the AF phase. Here, the Zn doping is used to reduce the mobility of the holes introduced by the Sr doping. Our data show a clear correlation between the degree of the hole localization and the magnetic ordering temperature T_{N}. In particular, we find that Zn doping increases T_{N} in lightly hole doped La2CuO4 due to the localization of the charge carriers.

Using a standard solid state reaction9 four series of polycrystalline La2-_x_Sr_xCu1-_z_Zn_O4 samples with different nominal compositions were prepared: one with a fixed Sr content (_x_ = 0.017) and various Zn doping (0 <= z <= 0.25), and another with a fixed Zn concentration (_z_ = 0.15) and various Sr doping (0 <= z <= 0.03). For comparison we show in addition results on La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 and La2Cu1-_z_Zn_O4, i.e., samples doped either with Sr (0 <= x <= 0.023) or with Zn (0 <= z <= 0.25). To reduce the excess oxygen all samples have been annealed for 72 h at 625 degC in pure N2 atmosphere. Within a series of samples with identical x (_z_) the differences of the Sr (Zn) content are smaller than \Delta x\sim +- 0.001 (\Delta z\sim +- 0.01). In order to obtain this necessary accuracy of the Sr content, a complete series of samples with different z was prepared from the same mixture of La2O3 and SrCO3. The error of x was checked by measuring T_{N} of different samples with identical compositions (e.g., for z = 0).

At low temperatures all investigated samples (_x_ <= 0.03) are insulators. It is well established that the electrical resistivity in this nonmetallic regime is described within the variable range hopping (VRH) model as \rho(T)\propto exp((_T_{0}/T)^{\alpha}), where T0 is a characteristic temperature controlled by the mobility of the holes and the exponent a depends on the dimensionality of the VRH process.10 As shown in Fig. 1 the resistivity r of La1.98Sr0.017Cu1-_z_Zn_O4 is well described assuming an exponent a = 1/3 which corresponds to a two

 -dimensional hopping at elevated temperatures [11]. The general trend of \rho(x,z) as a function of doping is an increase with decreasing x and increasing z, respectively. In the case of 2D VRH the characteristic temperature T_{0} is related to the localization radius r_{loc} of the holes via

\[T_{0}\!=\!\frac{13.8}{k_{B}N(\bm{\epsilon}_{F})r_{loc}^{2}},\] (1)

where N(\bm{\epsilon}_{F}) is the density of states at the Fermi energy [10]. Measurements of the electronic specific heat yield that N(\bm{\epsilon}_{F}) does not vary significantly in the doping regime of our experiments [12]. Therefore, we neglect a possible weak dependence of N(\bm{\epsilon}_{F}) on x and z in our qualitative discussion of the localization radius r_{loc}.

The values for T_{0}^{1/3} and the normalized localization radius r_{loc} are summarized in Fig. 2. Let us first focus on the data obtained for La_{1.985}Sr_{0.017}Cu_{1-\cdot}Zn_{0}O_{4} shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). A clear increase of T_{0}, i.e., an increasing localization, is observed with increasing Zn doping. The localization radius r_{loc} determined from T_{0} using Eq. (1) strongly decreases with increasing z and saturates for Zn doping z\approx 0.15.

The corresponding results for T_{0} and r_{loc} for the samples with fixed Zn content z\!=\!0.15 and variable Sr concentration x\!\approx\!0.03 are shown in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d) (full symbols). With increasing Sr content T_{0}^{1/3} (r_{loc}) decreases (increases), i.e., the holes become more mobile. However, we stress that for this high Zn content r_{loc} stays small even for the largest Sr doping (x\!=\!0.03). Indeed, our findings for z\!=\!0.15 markedly differ from the behavior in pure La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} , i.e., for z\!=\!0, which is also shown in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d) (open symbols). In the latter case there is a much stronger increase of the hole mobility (r_{loc}) with increasing x.

In the following we will show that this strong influence of the Zn doping on the hole mobility as revealed from our resistivity data clearly correlates with the magnetic properties. In Fig. 3 the magnetic susceptibility \chi is plotted for some representative La_{1.985}Sr_{0.017}Cu_{1-\cdot}Zn_{0}O_{4} samples with a fixed Sr content x\!=\!0.017 and different Zn concentrations (0\!\leq\!z\!\leq\!0.25). The susceptibilities are similar to that of the canted antiferromagnet La_{2}CuO_{4}[13]. The paramagnetic state at high temperatures is characterized by a Curie-Weiss-like increase of \chi with decreasing T, followed by a well defined peak which indicates the transition to AF order at T_{N}. At very low temperature a Curie-like upturn due to small amounts of paramagnetic moments (e.g., uncompensated Cu spins) is visible. Without Zn doping, T_{N}\!=\!125 K is observed which is significantly below T_{N} of pure La_{2}CuO_{4} due to the Sr doping (x\!=\!0.017). The remarkable feature of Fig. 3 is the fact that additional Zn doping initially does not lead to a further reduction of T_{N}. In contrast, T_{N} even increases up to T_{N}\!=\!144 K for z\!=\!0.05. Only for z\!>\!0.05, T_{N} starts to decrease again. Note that a large Zn concentration of z\!\approx\!0.1 is required to reach T_{N}\!=\!125 K measured for z\!=\!0.

A similar study of the influence of Zn doping on T_{N} has been performed for x\!=\!0, i.e., for samples without doped holes. A comparison of the T_{N} obtained for these two sets of samples is given in the phase diagram shown in Fig. 3(a). For x\!=\!0, the well-known linear decrease of T_{N}(z) with increasing z is observed. The distinction to our findings for the lightly hole doped compounds is apparent. However, note

The dotted line is a guide to the eye to emphasize the nonmonotonous dependence of T_{N} on Zn doping. The curves are displaced vertically by 1\!\times\!10^{-4} emu/mol for clarity.

The solid lines are guides to the eye. Values for La_{2}Cu_{0.98}Li_{0.02}O_{4} ( \Diamond ) are extracted from \rho(T) data in Ref. [14].

  that this difference reduces with increasing Zn content. Indeed, for large Zn contents z\geq0.15 the slope dT_{N}/dz is about the same for the two sets of samples. Thus, it is evident from the measured T_{N}(z) dependences that for the hole doped samples with x= 0.017 there is a kind of threshold value z\sim 0.15 for the Zn doping. Above this value T_{N} is consistent with a simple spin dilution, whereas for smaller Zn doping there is an apparently different mechanism controlling T_{N} for compounds with a finite hole content.

To obtain further insight into the effect of Zn and Sr doping on T_{N} in La_{2}CuO_{4} we have studied the susceptibility of samples with a fixed Zn content z= 0.15 and various Sr concentrations in the range 0<x< 0.03. The Neel temperatures of these samples monotonously decrease with increasing x as shown in Fig. 4(b) (full symbols). A quite remarkable result is obtained when comparing these findings to the well-known T_{N}(x) dependence of samples without Zn doping [open symbols in Fig. 4(b)]. In the absence of holes, i.e., for x= 0, T_{N} is much smaller in the Zn-doped compound as expected due to the dilution of the Cu spin system. However, the decrease of T_{N} with increasing Sr concentration is much weaker in the Zn-doped compounds and, finally, T_{N} of these samples is significantly larger than for the samples without Zn doping. The extrapolated critical Sr content for which T_{N}= 0 is as large as x_{c}\approx 0.033 for z= 0.15 and therefore clearly exceeds the corresponding value x_{c}= 0.02 of samples without Zn. A comparison of these experimental findings for T_{N} in Fig. 4(b) to the results of the resistivity measurements on the same samples shown in Fig. 2(d) indicates a relationship between T_{N} and r_{loc}; a strong decrease of T_{N} with increasing x seems to correlate with a strong increase of r_{loc} which is only present for z= 0.

In order to clarify this relationship between r_{loc} and T_{N} we consider again the series of Zn-doped samples with a fixed Sr content of x= 0.017. Both, the resistivity and the susceptibility data strongly suggest that one has to distinguish two regimes of Zn doping. There is a strong doping regime for z\geq 0.15 where the degree of localization does not change significantly as a function of the Zn content, i.e., the mobility of holes is already reduced to its minimum. In this doping regime T_{N} decreases linearly with the Zn content z which can be interpreted in terms of simple spin dilution. In contrast to that, the charge mobility is strongly affected by the Zn doping in the weak doping regime z\leq 0.15 as signaled by the strong decrease of r_{loc} in Fig. 2(b). In the same range of doping the unusual nonmonotonous change of T_{N} as a function of the Zn content is observed [see Fig. 4(a)]. Hence, in the low doping regime Zn doping plays a twofold role. On the one hand it reduces T_{N} due to the creation of static spin holes in the Cu spin lattice (spin dilution). However, on the other hand it causes a localization of the mobile holes thus reducing the effect of Sr doping on the AF order. The superconducting of these two effects causes the nonmonotonous change of T_{N} with increasing z.

Subtracting the effect of spin dilution which is known from the findings for La_{2}Cu_{1-x}.Zn_{x}O_{4} (as well as from the high Zn doping regime for x= 0.017) allows to determine the suppression of T_{N} due to the mobility of the holes. The result is plotted in Fig. 5 which shows T_{N}^{\rm Sr}=T_{N}(x,z)+[T_{N}^{0}-T_{N}(0,z)] as a function of the Zn content z for the samples with x= 0.017. Here, T_{N}^{0}= 292 K is the Neel temperature of pure La_{2}CuO_{4} and T_{N}^{\rm Sr} is the Neel temperature corrected for the influence of the dilution of the Cu spin lattice due to Zn doping. That is, T_{N}^{\rm Sr} represents the ordering temperature of "hypothetical" exclusively Sr-doped samples (x= 0.017) with different degree of hole mobility as measured by r_{loc}. From a comparison of T_{N}^{\rm Sr} and r_{loc} in Fig. 5 the crucial role of the hole mobility for suppression of AF order becomes apparent. The strong _reduction of r_{loc}_ at small z corresponds well with a respective steep _increase of T_{N}^{\rm Sr}_ by more than 100

  K. In the limit of strong localization (large z) both T_{N}^{\rm Sr}(z) and r_{loc}(z) tend to saturate. However, note that T_{N}^{\rm Sr} is still by about 40-50 K less than T_{N}^{0} as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 5. According to our analysis this remaining difference has to be attributed to the decrease of T_{N} due to quasistatic holes. This suppression which amounts to about 40-50 K for x = 0.017 is still about three times stronger than that for a Zn content of z = 0.017 in La_{2}Cu_{1-z}Zn_{x}O_{4}. The reason for this stronger influence is obvious, since a doped hole on an oxygen site does not only dilute the spin lattice, but also causes a ferromagnetic exchange between the adjacent Cu spins.[5] Nevertheless, only a small part of the decrease of T_{N} in LSCO can be explained with the presence of quasistatic holes. For a Sr content x = 0.017 this fraction amounts to about 1/4 of the total suppression (see inset of Fig. 5). Therefore our data show that the charge mobility plays the most significant role in destruction of the AF order in LSCO with increasing x.

This main conclusion of our study seems to contradict the above-mentioned findings on Li-doped La_{2}CuO_{4}.[8] However, also for Li hole doping the resistivity decreases strongly for small concentrations.[14] From the resistivity data in Ref. 14 we have estimated T_{0} and r_{loc} for a Li content of 2%. The results are included in Fig. 2. As expected the holes are less mobile than in LSCO. However, the localization radius in the Li-doped compound is significantly larger than in the case of quasistatic holes for high Zn contents. Accordingly, La_{2}Cu_{1-y}Li_{y}O_{4} should be compared to La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-z}Zn_{x}O_{4} at intermediate Zn doping, where charge mobility is still the main source of the suppressed T_{N}. From the correlation between T_{N}^{\rm Sr} and r_{loc} for the 1.7% Sr-doped samples shown in Fig. 5 or r_{loc} of the 2% Li-doped compound we estimate a Neel temperature of T_{N}\simeq 175 K. This value is in fair agreement with the measurements revealing T_{N}\simeq 140 K.[14] if we take into account the slightly larger hole content in the Li-doped sample, i.e., 2% instead of 1.7%. This agreement strongly confirms our data analysis in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-z}Zn_{x}O_{4} and, moreover, gives further experimental evidence for a correlation between transport and magnetic properties in lightly hole doped La_{2}CuO_{4}. In this respect our findings do not support the conclusions in Ref. 8. According to our results there is no apparent contradiction to the assumption that the mobility of individual holes determines both the electrical resistivity and the suppression of the magnetic order.

In summary, the investigation of the static magnetic susceptibility and the electrical resistivity of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1-z}Zn_{x}O_{4} has revealed a clear correlation between the antiferromagnetic ordering and the mobility of the holes in these compounds. Localizing the holes by Zn doping increases T_{N} and finally leads to a situation which is similar to that in La_{2}Cu_{1-z}Zn_{x}O_{4} where the AF order is only suppressed due to the dilution of the Cu spin lattice. From our data we conclude that the hole mobility is the most important source for the strong suppression of AF order in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}.
