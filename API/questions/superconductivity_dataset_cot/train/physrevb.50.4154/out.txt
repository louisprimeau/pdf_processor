Y_{1-n}Eu_{n}Ba_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} powder samples, with x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0, were synthesized at ambient pressure using either an acetate-tartrate sol-gel method or a LiF flux process. The lattice parameters and purity of the samples were checked using x-ray diffraction. The superconducting transition was monitored by magnetic-susceptibility measurements. Replacing yttrium with europium increased the unit-cell volume, decreased the orthorhombicity (_b_/_a_) and the critical temperature. The hyperfine interactions at the europium site were studied by ^{151}Eu Mossbauer spectroscopy. The complete quadrupole Hamiltonian of the 21.5-keV \gamma transition of ^{151}Eu was successfully applied in the analyses of the Mossbauer spectra. The Mossbauer parameters obtained were found to resemble those measured for the EuBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (1:2:3) system. It was demonstrated that magnetic alignment of the crystallites could not be obtained with an 11.7-T field, contrary to the 1:2:3 and other high-T_{c} systems.

## I Introduction

The R_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{6+n}O_{14+n} system (R = rare earth element; n = 0,1,2) offers wide possibilities for studying high-T_{c} superconductivity. The YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} (1:2:4) phase[1] is the third (n = 2) member of this homologous series of compounds. In terms of applications the 1:2:4 phase has attracted much interest because of the high thermal stability of the oxygen content.[2] Its relatively low T_{c} of 80 K can be increased to 90 K by substituting yttrium partly by calcium.[3] From a theoretical point of view YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} provides an additional model system for testing the general trends in the properties of high-T_{c} superconducting cuprates. The 1:2:4 phase differs from YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (1:2:3) in having a double, instead of single, Cu-O chain running parallel to the b axis.

The YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} phase is thermodynamically favored at low temperatures and high oxygen pressures. Although it was first isolated under an oxygen pressure of 400 atm,[1] bulk synthesis in ambient conditions is possible as well.[4, 5, 6] Preparation of the 1:2:4 phase under normal pressure is, however, strongly limited by reaction kinetics. In the present study a sufficient reaction rate was achieved by using either homogeneous acetate-tartrate gels as precursors or LiF as a flux.[7, 8] The similar chemistry of rare earth elements generally enables various mutual replacements in compounds containing these elements. This is also the case in the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} phase, in which yttrium may be substituted by most of the other rare earth elements from lanthanum to ytterbium without destroying the structure. In the RBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} phase the range of the R ionic radii tolerated by the structure seems to be narrower, since only Eu, Gd, Dy, Ho, and Er bulk 1:2:4 samples have been successfully synthesized under 1 atm oxygen pressure.[9, 10, 11] However, application of the high-pressure synthesis technique extends the upper and lower limits for the R radii to Sm and Tm, respectively.[12] Furthermore, the dependence of T_{c} on the lattice parameters is different in the 1:2:3 and 1:2:4 phases. The critical temperature is slightly increased with increasing volume of the 1:2:3 unit cell,[13, 14] while in the 1:2:4 structure an opposite behavior has been observed.[9, 12, 15]

Room-temperature measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of several cuprate superconductors in single-crystal form have revealed a large anisotropy between the values obtained parallel to the c axis and perpendicular to it.[16, 17] A crystallite put in a strong magnetic field will, due to the anisotropy of the susceptibility, be subjected to a torque striving to align the crystalline c axis either parallel or perpendicular to the field.[18] By using various R atoms in the lattice the magnitude and direction of the anisotropy can be altered, thus changing the preferred alignment direction of the crystallites.[17] This effect has been utilized in studies of the Bi- and 1:2:3-based cuprate systems.[19, 20]

Several of the rare earth isotopes have \gamma transitions suitable for Mossbauer measurements. The most commonly used isotope for characterization of superconducting phases is ^{151}Eu.[19, 21, 22] Contrary to the 1:2:3 phase, only very few ^{151}Eu Mossbauer studies on the Y_{1-x}Eu_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} system have been published.[22] In the 1:2:3 system a substantial electric field gradient (efg), with a negative-valued main component (V_{xz}) and a nonzero asymmetry parameter (\eta=\frac{|V_{\mathbf{x}}|-|V_{\mathbf{x}}|}{|V_{xz}|}) has been found. In the present study the volume of the 1:2:4 cell has been controlled by increasing the europium substitution level x gradually from 0.0 to 1.0. Local chemical and electrical interactions around the R lattice site have been examined. The complete electric quadrupole Hamiltonian of the excited \frac{7}{2} and ground \frac{5}{2} spin states was used when analyzing the Mossbauer spectra.19 Along with Mossbauer spectroscopy the synthesis products have been characterized by x-ray diffraction for the phase purity, lattice constants, and texture effects in alignment experiments. Thermal analysis was used to study the oxygen stability and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements to check the superconducting properties.

## II Experimental Details

A series of Y1-zEuBa2Cu4O8 samples with _x_= 0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 were prepared by an acetate-tartrate sol-gel method described in more detail in Ref. 7. Appropriate mixtures of Y2O3 and Eu2O3 (0.003 125 mol) were first dissolved in 100 ml of 0.2 M CH3COOH. In each case a clear solution was obtained after stirring for 10 h at 55-60 degC in a beaker covered with a watch glass. Next, 50 ml of 0.5 M Cu(CH3COOH)2-H2O, 25 ml of 0.5 M Ba(CH3COOH)2, and 20 ml of 0.55 M aqueous tartaric acid solution were added to the rare earth acetate solutions with adequate intermediate stirrings. After concentrating for 8 h at 65 degC in an open beaker under stirring the above solutions turned into blue gels. The gels were first dried in air at 80 degC and then preheated (10 h) and sintered (30 h) at 780 degC in flowing oxygen. Additionally, in order to find out the possible effects of the synthesis technique on the material properties, another sample with x = 1.0 was prepared by a solid state reaction using stoichiometric amounts of EuBa2Cu3O7-d and CuO powders as starting materials and 2.5 wt. % of LiF as a reaction rate enhancer.8 The mixture was heated in flowing oxygen at 785 degC in powder form for 15 h and as pelletized for 75 h with several intermediate grindings and repressings.

The thermal decomposition of the gel powders was studied by means of thermogravimetric (TG) analyses up to 1000 degC in a dynamic oxygen atmosphere (heating rate 2 degC/min; sample size 50-70 mg) using a Perkin-Elmer System 7 thermobalance. Also, the oxygen stability of the final products under oxygen and argon atmospheres was confirmed by TG measurements (heating and cooling rates 5 degC/min; sample size 25-40 mg).

The phase purity and the crystallinity of the products were studied by x-ray diffraction analyses using a Philips MPD 1880 diffractometer equipped with a graphite secondary monochromator and a Cu tube. The lattice parameters of the samples were obtained from the diffraction spectra by fitting the peaks of identified reflections using free intensities and one common line width [full width at half maximum (FWHM)]. Lorentzian-shaped lines were used.

The reported critical temperatures of superconductivity are onset temperatures of the diamagnetic signal determined by a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS2).

For Mossbauer measurements powder-absorber thicknesses of 20 mg/cm2 were used. Some of the samples were mixed in epoxy resin and exposed to an 11.7-T magnetic field while the mixture was hardening. The aim was to orient the crystallites in the direction of the field. These texture effects were first checked by x-ray diffraction.

Room-temperature 151Eu Mossbauer spectra were recorded in transmission geometry. A standard 100-mCi 151Sm:_Sm_2O_3 source was used. The 21.5-keV \gamma quanta were detected with a scintillation detector equipped with a 3-mm-thick NaI crystal. The linear periodic Doppler modulation used in the measurements had a maximum velocity of 4 mm/s. A maximum velocity of 20 mm/s was applied to check for the presence of Eu ions in the 2+ oxidation state.

## III Results and Discussion

The 1:2:4 phase is formed in a flowing oxygen atmosphere above 750 degC as the annealing time is increased. The thermal decomposition of the (Y,Eu)-Ba-Cu acetate-tartrate precursor gels was followed up to 1000 degC by thermogravimetric measurements (Fig. 1). The weight loss below 200 degC is due to the evolvement of water and decomposition of the copper constituent part.7 The final decomposition of the gels above 200 degC proceeds in several steps via various unidentified intermediate species

  and BaCO3 (at around 750 degC). Essentially single-phase Y1-_x_Eu_Ba_2Cu_4O_8 samples were obtained after annealing the dried gel powders at 780 degC for 40 h, as well as by the LiF-enhanced solid state reaction of EuBa2Cu3O7-_d_ and CuO powders at 785 degC after a total heat treatment time of 90 h.

The x-ray diffraction spectra of the sol-gel-prepared YBa2Cu4O8 and EuBa2Cu4O8 are shown in Fig. 2. The reflections of the 1:2:4 phase are indicated; the unidentified peaks seen at the 2_th_ values of 29 deg and 31 deg are due to small amounts of BaCuO2 impurities,7 while the peak at 37.5 deg indicates the presence of CuO. The BaCuO2 peaks are not observed in the sample synthesized by the LiF flux method, in which mainly traces of CuO and Eu2BaCu7O15-_d_ (2:4:7) are found. Because of the structural similarities, the strongest peaks of the x-ray diffraction patterns of the 1:2:3 and 1:2:4 phases coincide, which makes it difficult to detect small amounts of 1:2:3 impurities. The single-phase character of all the Y1-_x_Eu_a_Ba_2Cu_4O_8 samples was therefore checked by TG measurements. The 1:2:4 phase should be stable up to 670-900 degC depending on the atmosphere,23 while the 1:2:3 phase starts to lose oxygen already around 330-400 degC. Figure 3 shows the TG curves of subsequent heating and cooling cycles under oxygen and argon atmospheres for the sol-gel-synthesized EuBa2Cu4O8 sample. Even in an argon atmosphere no weight loss is seen below 680 degC and in an oxygen atmosphere the oxygen content is stable up to 840 degC. Finally, the SQUID measurements showed no indication of the characteristic 90-K transition of the 1:2:3 phase.

Throughout the whole substitutional range the line positions of the x-ray peaks indicated an orthorhombic lattice with no signs of superlattice effects. The results from lattice parameter fits of the spectra are given in Table 1. As is seen the a and b parameters increase with increasing x, while the c parameter shows very little variation. The net effect is that the unit cell volume increases by 5.3(4) A3 as x is changed from 0.0 to 1.0. The increase is expected since europium has a larger ionic radius than yttrium. The orthorhombicity, here defined as _b_/_a_, decreases as the Eu portion is increased, which is, e.g., indicated by the decrease of the distance between the 020 and 200 reflections. In the fittings these two peaks were constrained to have equal intensities. The decrease in orthorhombicity is also expected since 1:2:4 samples based on R elements with larger ionic radii have smaller orthorhombicity according to Refs. 9 and 12.

The larger peak width for the x = 1.0 (LiF) sample could indicate the presence of a somewhat larger portion of the 2:4:7 phase, the peaks of which overlap with the 1:2:4 peaks. X-ray diffraction spectra measured from specimens subjected to the magnetic field merely repeated the patterns obtained for powder specimens. The magnetic field thus failed to change the random orientation of the crystallites.

The value for _T_c was seen to decrease with increasing Eu content. The _T_c value of 78 K was measured for the samples having 0% or 25% of yttrium replaced by europium. For the samples with x = 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0, _T_c's of 77, 75, and 74 K were obtained, respectively. The trend of decreasing critical temperature with increasing

  cell volume is consistent with the results observed for a series of 1:2:4 samples, having R atoms with ionic radii ranging from Tm to Sm.[9,12,16]

In Fig. 4 the ^{151}Eu Mossbauer spectrum measured for the EuBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} sample (sol-gel synthesis) is shown. Since no orientation effects could be observed in the x-ray spectra of samples exposed to a magnetic field, the Mossbauer spectra could be uniquely fitted with the following parameters: background level, total line intensity, line width \Gamma (in mm/s), center shift S (in mm/s), \eta, and the quadrupole coupling constant eQ_{g}V_{xz} (in mm/s). The latter two parameters fully determine the position and intensities of the 12 possible \gamma transitions. The values Q_{g}=1.14\times 10^{-28} m^{2} and Q_{e}=1.50\times 10^{-28} m^{2} for the quadrupole moments of the ground and excited states of ^{151}Eu were used.[24] The center shift gives a measure of the s electron density inside the nucleus and therefore also reflects the oxidation state of the atom. The values of the hyperfine parameters obtained for the R site resemble very much those observed for the 1:2:3 system. This is expected due to the similarity of the R sites in these two compounds. The value of |eQ_{g}V_{xz}| is, however, smaller than for the 1:2:3 system, in which |eQ_{g}V_{xz}|\simeq 5.5 mm/s was observed.[19] In Table II the parameters obtained by fitting the Mossbauer spectra are given.

All the Eu atoms are in a 3+ oxidation state since the relative line shift with respect to the Eu^{3+} atoms of the source is close to zero Doppler velocity. A tiny shift towards smaller Doppler velocities is, however, seen when the Eu portion is increased. This shift \Delta S=-0.02(1) mm/s can be explained by the expansion of the crystal lattice, which lowers the s electron density by easing the pressure on the electron orbitals. A similar effect has been reported for the 1:2:3 system, in which the lattice expansion is caused by removal of oxygen.[19] With the aid of formulas (1) and (2) from Ref. [19] we may calculate the expected \Delta S, taking the relative volume expansion \frac{\Delta V}{V}=0.006(1) between the samples x=0.25 and x=1.0, from the lattice parameter data (Table I). The result is \delta S=-0.012(2) mm/s, which agrees with the measured value.

The slight decrease of \eta probably reflects the decrease of orthorhombicity, which makes the difference between the potential derivatives V_{xz} and V_{yy} smaller. In fact for a tetragonal sample \eta should be zero.

The larger linewidth and statistical errors for the x=1.0 (LiF) sample could again indicate the presence of a somewhat larger amount of the 2:4:7 phase.

## IV Conclusions

Essentially single-phase Eu- and Y-based 1:2:4 samples can be synthesized under 1 atm oxygen pressure using sol gel and LiF flux methods. Magnetic-susceptibility measurements showed only the 80-K transition of the 1:2:4 phase, with no signs of the 90-K transition. Thermodynamic measurements also confirmed the purity of

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c} x & a (Å) & b (Å) & c (Å) & Volume (Å^{3}) & b/a & w (deg) \\
0.0 & 3.8538(6) & 3.8745(7) & 27.267(6) & 407.1(2) & 1.0054(3) & 0.195(4) \\
0.25 & 3.8648(8) & 3.886(1) & 27.290(8) & 409.8(3) & 1.0054(5) & 0.205(4) \\
0.5 & 3.8743(2) & 3  the samples. Replacing yttrium with increasing amounts of europium (0-100 %) decreases the orthorhombicity of the samples and lowers the T_{\varepsilon}. The larger ionic radius of Eu^{3+} as compared to Y^{3+} also causes the unit cell to expand. The samples exhibit no orientational effects in an 11.7-T magnetic field, contrary to the 1:2:3 and related systems which orient readily.

In the Mossbauer spectra the expansion of the crystal lattice was detected as a change in the center shift. The value of the hyperfine parameters obtained resembled closely those obtained from the EuBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} system. The quadrupole coupling constant was somewhat smaller.

Y_{1-n}Eu_{n}Ba_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} powder samples, with x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0, were synthesized at ambient pressure using either an acetate-tartrate sol-gel method or a LiF flux process. The lattice parameters and purity of the samples were checked using x-ray diffraction. The superconducting transition was monitored by magnetic-susceptibility measurements. Replacing yttrium with europium increased the unit-cell volume, decreased the orthorhombicity (_b_/_a_) and the critical temperature. The hyperfine interactions at the europium site were studied by ^{151}Eu Mossbauer spectroscopy. The complete quadrupole Hamiltonian of the 21.5-keV \gamma transition of ^{151}Eu was successfully applied in the analyses of the Mossbauer spectra. The Mossbauer parameters obtained were found to resemble those measured for the EuBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (1:2:3) system. It was demonstrated that magnetic alignment of the crystallites could not be obtained with an 11.7-T field, contrary to the 1:2:3 and other high-T_{c} systems.

## I Introduction

The R_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{6+n}O_{14+n} system (R = rare earth element; n = 0,1,2) offers wide possibilities for studying high-T_{c} superconductivity. The YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} (1:2:4) phase[1] is the third (n = 2) member of this homologous series of compounds. In terms of applications the 1:2:4 phase has attracted much interest because of the high thermal stability of the oxygen content.[2] Its relatively low T_{c} of 80 K can be increased to 90 K by substituting yttrium partly by calcium.[3] From a theoretical point of view YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} provides an additional model system for testing the general trends in the properties of high-T_{c} superconducting cuprates. The 1:2:4 phase differs from YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (1:2:3) in having a double, instead of single, Cu-O chain running parallel to the b axis.

The YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} phase is thermodynamically favored at low temperatures and high oxygen pressures. Although it was first isolated under an oxygen pressure of 400 atm,[1] bulk synthesis in ambient conditions is possible as well.[4, 5, 6] Preparation of the 1:2:4 phase under normal pressure is, however, strongly limited by reaction kinetics. In the present study a sufficient reaction rate was achieved by using either homogeneous acetate-tartrate gels as precursors or LiF as a flux.[7, 8] The similar chemistry of rare earth elements generally enables various mutual replacements in compounds containing these elements. This is also the case in the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} phase, in which yttrium may be substituted by most of the other rare earth elements from lanthanum to ytterbium without destroying the structure. In the RBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} phase the range of the R ionic radii tolerated by the structure seems to be narrower, since only Eu, Gd, Dy, Ho, and Er bulk 1:2:4 samples have been successfully synthesized under 1 atm oxygen pressure.[9, 10, 11] However, application of the high-pressure synthesis technique extends the upper and lower limits for the R radii to Sm and Tm, respectively.[12] Furthermore, the dependence of T_{c} on the lattice parameters is different in the 1:2:3 and 1:2:4 phases. The critical temperature is slightly increased with increasing volume of the 1:2:3 unit cell,[13, 14] while in the 1:2:4 structure an opposite behavior has been observed.[9, 12, 15]

Room-temperature measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of several cuprate superconductors in single-crystal form have revealed a large anisotropy between the values obtained parallel to the c axis and perpendicular to it.[16, 17] A crystallite put in a strong magnetic field will, due to the anisotropy of the susceptibility, be subjected to a torque striving to align the crystalline c axis either parallel or perpendicular to the field.[18] By using various R atoms in the lattice the magnitude and direction of the anisotropy can be altered, thus changing the preferred alignment direction of the crystallites.[17] This effect has been utilized in studies of the Bi- and 1:2:3-based cuprate systems.[19, 20]

Several of the rare earth isotopes have \gamma transitions suitable for Mossbauer measurements. The most commonly used isotope for characterization of superconducting phases is ^{151}Eu.[19, 21, 22] Contrary to the 1:2:3 phase, only very few ^{151}Eu Mossbauer studies on the Y_{1-x}Eu_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} system have been published.[22] In the 1:2:3 system a substantial electric field gradient (efg), with a negative-valued main component (V_{xz}) and a nonzero asymmetry parameter (\eta=\frac{|V_{\mathbf{x}}|-|V_{\mathbf{x}}|}{|V_{xz}|}) has been found. In the present study the volume of the 1:2:4 cell has been controlled by increasing the europium substitution level x gradually from 0.0 to 1.0. Local chemical and electrical interactions around the R lattice site have been examined. The complete electric quadrupole Hamiltonian of the excited \frac{7}{2} and ground \frac{5}{2} spin states was used when analyzing the Mossbauer spectra.19 Along with Mossbauer spectroscopy the synthesis products have been characterized by x-ray diffraction for the phase purity, lattice constants, and texture effects in alignment experiments. Thermal analysis was used to study the oxygen stability and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements to check the superconducting properties.

## II Experimental Details

A series of Y1-zEuBa2Cu4O8 samples with _x_= 0.0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 were prepared by an acetate-tartrate sol-gel method described in more detail in Ref. 7. Appropriate mixtures of Y2O3 and Eu2O3 (0.003 125 mol) were first dissolved in 100 ml of 0.2 M CH3COOH. In each case a clear solution was obtained after stirring for 10 h at 55-60 degC in a beaker covered with a watch glass. Next, 50 ml of 0.5 M Cu(CH3COOH)2-H2O, 25 ml of 0.5 M Ba(CH3COOH)2, and 20 ml of 0.55 M aqueous tartaric acid solution were added to the rare earth acetate solutions with adequate intermediate stirrings. After concentrating for 8 h at 65 degC in an open beaker under stirring the above solutions turned into blue gels. The gels were first dried in air at 80 degC and then preheated (10 h) and sintered (30 h) at 780 degC in flowing oxygen. Additionally, in order to find out the possible effects of the synthesis technique on the material properties, another sample with x = 1.0 was prepared by a solid state reaction using stoichiometric amounts of EuBa2Cu3O7-d and CuO powders as starting materials and 2.5 wt. % of LiF as a reaction rate enhancer.8 The mixture was heated in flowing oxygen at 785 degC in powder form for 15 h and as pelletized for 75 h with several intermediate grindings and repressings.

The thermal decomposition of the gel powders was studied by means of thermogravimetric (TG) analyses up to 1000 degC in a dynamic oxygen atmosphere (heating rate 2 degC/min; sample size 50-70 mg) using a Perkin-Elmer System 7 thermobalance. Also, the oxygen stability of the final products under oxygen and argon atmospheres was confirmed by TG measurements (heating and cooling rates 5 degC/min; sample size 25-40 mg).

The phase purity and the crystallinity of the products were studied by x-ray diffraction analyses using a Philips MPD 1880 diffractometer equipped with a graphite secondary monochromator and a Cu tube. The lattice parameters of the samples were obtained from the diffraction spectra by fitting the peaks of identified reflections using free intensities and one common line width [full width at half maximum (FWHM)]. Lorentzian-shaped lines were used.

The reported critical temperatures of superconductivity are onset temperatures of the diamagnetic signal determined by a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS2).

For Mossbauer measurements powder-absorber thicknesses of 20 mg/cm2 were used. Some of the samples were mixed in epoxy resin and exposed to an 11.7-T magnetic field while the mixture was hardening. The aim was to orient the crystallites in the direction of the field. These texture effects were first checked by x-ray diffraction.

Room-temperature 151Eu Mossbauer spectra were recorded in transmission geometry. A standard 100-mCi 151Sm:_Sm_2O_3 source was used. The 21.5-keV \gamma quanta were detected with a scintillation detector equipped with a 3-mm-thick NaI crystal. The linear periodic Doppler modulation used in the measurements had a maximum velocity of 4 mm/s. A maximum velocity of 20 mm/s was applied to check for the presence of Eu ions in the 2+ oxidation state.

## III Results and Discussion

The 1:2:4 phase is formed in a flowing oxygen atmosphere above 750 degC as the annealing time is increased. The thermal decomposition of the (Y,Eu)-Ba-Cu acetate-tartrate precursor gels was followed up to 1000 degC by thermogravimetric measurements (Fig. 1). The weight loss below 200 degC is due to the evolvement of water and decomposition of the copper constituent part.7 The final decomposition of the gels above 200 degC proceeds in several steps via various unidentified intermediate species

  and BaCO3 (at around 750 degC). Essentially single-phase Y1-_x_Eu_Ba_2Cu_4O_8 samples were obtained after annealing the dried gel powders at 780 degC for 40 h, as well as by the LiF-enhanced solid state reaction of EuBa2Cu3O7-_d_ and CuO powders at 785 degC after a total heat treatment time of 90 h.

The x-ray diffraction spectra of the sol-gel-prepared YBa2Cu4O8 and EuBa2Cu4O8 are shown in Fig. 2. The reflections of the 1:2:4 phase are indicated; the unidentified peaks seen at the 2_th_ values of 29 deg and 31 deg are due to small amounts of BaCuO2 impurities,7 while the peak at 37.5 deg indicates the presence of CuO. The BaCuO2 peaks are not observed in the sample synthesized by the LiF flux method, in which mainly traces of CuO and Eu2BaCu7O15-_d_ (2:4:7) are found. Because of the structural similarities, the strongest peaks of the x-ray diffraction patterns of the 1:2:3 and 1:2:4 phases coincide, which makes it difficult to detect small amounts of 1:2:3 impurities. The single-phase character of all the Y1-_x_Eu_a_Ba_2Cu_4O_8 samples was therefore checked by TG measurements. The 1:2:4 phase should be stable up to 670-900 degC depending on the atmosphere,23 while the 1:2:3 phase starts to lose oxygen already around 330-400 degC. Figure 3 shows the TG curves of subsequent heating and cooling cycles under oxygen and argon atmospheres for the sol-gel-synthesized EuBa2Cu4O8 sample. Even in an argon atmosphere no weight loss is seen below 680 degC and in an oxygen atmosphere the oxygen content is stable up to 840 degC. Finally, the SQUID measurements showed no indication of the characteristic 90-K transition of the 1:2:3 phase.

Throughout the whole substitutional range the line positions of the x-ray peaks indicated an orthorhombic lattice with no signs of superlattice effects. The results from lattice parameter fits of the spectra are given in Table 1. As is seen the a and b parameters increase with increasing x, while the c parameter shows very little variation. The net effect is that the unit cell volume increases by 5.3(4) A3 as x is changed from 0.0 to 1.0. The increase is expected since europium has a larger ionic radius than yttrium. The orthorhombicity, here defined as _b_/_a_, decreases as the Eu portion is increased, which is, e.g., indicated by the decrease of the distance between the 020 and 200 reflections. In the fittings these two peaks were constrained to have equal intensities. The decrease in orthorhombicity is also expected since 1:2:4 samples based on R elements with larger ionic radii have smaller orthorhombicity according to Refs. 9 and 12.

The larger peak width for the x = 1.0 (LiF) sample could indicate the presence of a somewhat larger portion of the 2:4:7 phase, the peaks of which overlap with the 1:2:4 peaks. X-ray diffraction spectra measured from specimens subjected to the magnetic field merely repeated the patterns obtained for powder specimens. The magnetic field thus failed to change the random orientation of the crystallites.

The value for _T_c was seen to decrease with increasing Eu content. The _T_c value of 78 K was measured for the samples having 0% or 25% of yttrium replaced by europium. For the samples with x = 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0, _T_c's of 77, 75, and 74 K were obtained, respectively. The trend of decreasing critical temperature with increasing

  cell volume is consistent with the results observed for a series of 1:2:4 samples, having R atoms with ionic radii ranging from Tm to Sm.[9,12,16]

In Fig. 4 the ^{151}Eu Mossbauer spectrum measured for the EuBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} sample (sol-gel synthesis) is shown. Since no orientation effects could be observed in the x-ray spectra of samples exposed to a magnetic field, the Mossbauer spectra could be uniquely fitted with the following parameters: background level, total line intensity, line width \Gamma (in mm/s), center shift S (in mm/s), \eta, and the quadrupole coupling constant eQ_{g}V_{xz} (in mm/s). The latter two parameters fully determine the position and intensities of the 12 possible \gamma transitions. The values Q_{g}=1.14\times 10^{-28} m^{2} and Q_{e}=1.50\times 10^{-28} m^{2} for the quadrupole moments of the ground and excited states of ^{151}Eu were used.[24] The center shift gives a measure of the s electron density inside the nucleus and therefore also reflects the oxidation state of the atom. The values of the hyperfine parameters obtained for the R site resemble very much those observed for the 1:2:3 system. This is expected due to the similarity of the R sites in these two compounds. The value of |eQ_{g}V_{xz}| is, however, smaller than for the 1:2:3 system, in which |eQ_{g}V_{xz}|\simeq 5.5 mm/s was observed.[19] In Table II the parameters obtained by fitting the Mossbauer spectra are given.

All the Eu atoms are in a 3+ oxidation state since the relative line shift with respect to the Eu^{3+} atoms of the source is close to zero Doppler velocity. A tiny shift towards smaller Doppler velocities is, however, seen when the Eu portion is increased. This shift \Delta S=-0.02(1) mm/s can be explained by the expansion of the crystal lattice, which lowers the s electron density by easing the pressure on the electron orbitals. A similar effect has been reported for the 1:2:3 system, in which the lattice expansion is caused by removal of oxygen.[19] With the aid of formulas (1) and (2) from Ref. [19] we may calculate the expected \Delta S, taking the relative volume expansion \frac{\Delta V}{V}=0.006(1) between the samples x=0.25 and x=1.0, from the lattice parameter data (Table I). The result is \delta S=-0.012(2) mm/s, which agrees with the measured value.

The slight decrease of \eta probably reflects the decrease of orthorhombicity, which makes the difference between the potential derivatives V_{xz} and V_{yy} smaller. In fact for a tetragonal sample \eta should be zero.

The larger linewidth and statistical errors for the x=1.0 (LiF) sample could again indicate the presence of a somewhat larger amount of the 2:4:7 phase.

## IV Conclusions

Essentially single-phase Eu- and Y-based 1:2:4 samples can be synthesized under 1 atm oxygen pressure using sol gel and LiF flux methods. Magnetic-susceptibility measurements showed only the 80-K transition of the 1:2:4 phase, with no signs of the 90-K transition. Thermodynamic measurements also confirmed the purity of

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c} x & a (Å) & b (Å) & c (Å) & Volume (Å^{3}) & b/a & w (deg) \\
0.0 & 3.8538(6) & 3.8745(7) & 27.267(6) & 407.1(2) & 1.0054(3) & 0.195(4) \\
0.25 & 3.8648(8) & 3.886(1) & 27.290(8) & 409.8(3) & 1.0054(5) & 0.205(4) \\
0.5 & 3.8743(2) & 3  the samples. Replacing yttrium with increasing amounts of europium (0-100 %) decreases the orthorhombicity of the samples and lowers the T_{\varepsilon}. The larger ionic radius of Eu^{3+} as compared to Y^{3+} also causes the unit cell to expand. The samples exhibit no orientational effects in an 11.7-T magnetic field, contrary to the 1:2:3 and related systems which orient readily.

In the Mossbauer spectra the expansion of the crystal lattice was detected as a change in the center shift. The value of the hyperfine parameters obtained resembled closely those obtained from the EuBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} system. The quadrupole coupling constant was somewhat smaller.
