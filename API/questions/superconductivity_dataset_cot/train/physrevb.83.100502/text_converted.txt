###### Abstract

The variations of in- and inter-plane London penetration depths, Δλ(T),
were measured using a tunnel diode resonator in single crystals of the
intrinsic pnictide superconductor LiFeAs. This compound appears to be in
the clean limit with a residual resistivity of 4 (T → 0) to 8 (T_(c)) μΩ
cm and a residual resistivity ratio of 65 to 35, respectively. The
superfluid density ρ_(s)(T) = λ²(0)/λ²(T) is well described by the
self-consistent two-gap γ model. Together with the previous data, our
results support the universal evolution of the superconducting gap from
nodeless to nodal upon departure from optimal doping even in clean
systems. We also conclude that pair-breaking scattering plays an
important role in the deviation of the low-temperature behavior of λ(T)
from the exponential in Fe-based compounds.

Studies of the superconducting gap structure play an important role in
the determination of the mechanism responsible for superconducting
pairing. In iron-based superconductors,¹ the situation regarding the gap
structure remains controversial. In the optimally doped "1111"
RFeAs(O,F) compounds (R = rare earth), tunneling² and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)³ experiments have found a full
superconducting gap. An exponential low-temperature variation of the
penetration depth λ(T) was reported in compounds with magnetic rare
earths Sm1111 (Ref. 4) and Pr1111, (Ref. 5) but the nonmagnetic La1111
has shown a power-law behavior close to T², incompatible with a clean,
full gap.⁶ A similar power-law behavior of λ(T) was found in optimally
electron-doped Ba(Fe_(1 − x)T_(x))₂As₂ ("BaT122," T = transition
metal)⁷ ⁻ ¹⁰ and hole-doped Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ ("BaK122").^(11, 12)
It was suggested that such a nonexponential behavior comes from a full
gap with pair-breaking scattering.^(10, 11, 13 − 18) On the other hand,
in clean (as suggested by observations of quantum oscillations)¹⁹ ⁻ ²¹
isoelectronic P-doped BaFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂ ("BaP122"),²² and
low-T_(c) stoichiometric LaFePO (Ref. 23) and KFe₂As₂ ("K122"),^(24, 25)
the gap appears to be nodal, which was suggested to be an intrinsic
behavior of clean Fe pnictides. However, nodal behavior was observed
also in dirty systems. Doping-dependent gap anisotropy^(26, 27) and
nodes^(9, 28) were reported for 122 crystals. It was suggested that a
full gap at optimal doping evolves into a three-dimensional nodal
structure when doped toward the edges of the superconducting "dome."
Hereafter, when we refer to a "full gap," we cannot exclude the
possibility of some angular variation (e.g., see Refs. 29, 30, 31, 32),
and only mean that such variation is smaller than the gap magnitude.

Since doping inevitably introduces scattering,³³ which is pair-breaking
in iron pnictides,^(10, 13, 14, 16 − 18) measurements of stoichiometric
intrinsic superconductors become of utmost importance. LiFeAs with
relatively high T_(c) ≈ 18 K (Refs. 34, 35, 36, 37) is among the very
few such compounds. It is one of the cleanest systems with a high
residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of about 50,³⁷ much higher than BaP122
(5 to 8 for different doping),³⁸ BaCo122 (3 to 4),³⁹ BaK122 (7 to 10),⁴⁰
and pure Ba122 (7 to 10 under pressure),⁴¹ though still below pure K122
(over 1000).²⁵ Since T_(c) of LiFeAs decreases with pressure,^(36, 42)
which is observed only in optimally and overdoped compounds,⁴³ we can
assign its "equivalent" doping level as slightly overdoped. This is
opposed to underdoped NaFeAs, in which T_(c) goes through a maximum with
pressure,⁴⁴ and heavily overdoped K122. This doping assignment is
consistent with the temperature-dependent resistivity, which is
discussed later. With the much-reduced effect of pair-breaking
scattering, the comparison of these stoichiometric compounds can provide
insight into the intrinsic evolution of the superconducting gap.

Due to high chemical reactivity of LiFeAs, only few studies exist. A
single, isotropic gap,⁴⁵ as well as two-gap pairing,⁴⁸ were reported
using ARPES. Two-gap superconductivity is also supported by
magnetization,^(99, 50) specific heat,⁵¹ and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR).⁵²

In this Rapid Communication, we report on the in-plane London
penetration depth λ(T) in single crystals of LiFeAs measured using a
tunnel diode resonator (TDR).⁵³ The superfluid density can be well
fitted with the self-consistent, clean, two-gap γ model.⁵⁴ Our results
imply that the ground state of pnictide superconductors in the clean
limit at optimal doping is given by two distinct full gaps,
Δ₁/k_(B)T_(c) ∼ 2 and Δ₂/k_(B)T_(c) ∼ 1.

Single crystals of LiFeAs were grown in a sealed tungsten crucible using
the Bridgeman method^(37, 50) and were transported in sealed ampoules.
Immediately after opening, [(0.5 − 1) × (0.5 − 1) × (0.1 − 0.3)] mm³
pieces of the same crystal (with all surfaces cleaved in Apiezon N
grease) were used for TDR, transport, and magnetization measurements.
Samples from two different batches were measured, and we found
compatible results in all measurements, with bulk superconducting
transition consistent with previous reports.^(37, 50) In what follows,
we present all results for samples from batch 1. Small resistance
contacts (∼0.1 mΩ) were tin-soldered⁵⁵ and in-plane resistivity was
measured using four-probe technique. The transition temperature T_(c)
was determined at the maximum of the derivative dΔλ(T)/dT (Table 1). The
London penetration depth was measured with the TDR technique (for
review, see Ref. 56). The sample was inserted into a 2-mm-inner-diameter
copper coil that produced an rf excitation field (at f ≈ 14 MHz) with
amplitude $H_{\rm ac}\sim 20$ mOe, which is much smaller than
$H_{\rm c1}$. Measurements of the in-plane penetration depth
$\Delta\lambda_{\rm ab}(T)$ were done with $H_{\rm ac}\parallel c$-axis,
while with $H_{\rm ac}.\perp c$, we measured
$\Delta\lambda_{c,\rm mix}(T)$ containing a linear combination of
$\lambda_{\rm ab}$ and λ_(c) (Ref. 9). The shift of the resonant
frequency (in cgs units) is ΔJ(T) = −G4π χ(T), where χ(T) is the
differential magnetic susceptibility, G = f₀V_(s)/2V_(e)(1 − N) is a
constant, N is the demagnetization factor, V_(s) is the sample volume,
and V_(c) is the coil volume. The constant G was determined from the
full frequency change by physically pulling the sample out of the coil.
With the characteristic sample size R, 4π χ = (λ/R)tanh (R/λ) − 1, from
which Δλ can be obtained.[56, 57]

The main panel in Fig. 1 shows the temperature-dependent resistivity
ρ(T) (left axis) and skin depth δ(T) (right axis). ρ(T) up to room
temperature is shown in the top inset. The residual resistivity ratio
${\rm RR}=\rho(300K)/\rho(20K)=35$, and it reaches the value of 65 when
extrapolated to T = 0 using a second-order polynomial. This behavior is
consistent with the T-dependent resistivity of BaCo122 in the overdoped
regime.[58] The calculated skin depth (in cgs units),
$\delta_{c}(T)=(c/2\pi)\sqrt{\rho/T}$, compares well with the TDR data
for T > T_(c), where Δf/f₀ = G[1 − ℜ[tanh (αR)/(αR)], α = (1 − i)/δ
(Ref. 59) when we use ρ(300K) = 250 μΩ cm, the lowest directly measured
value among our crystals. A very good quantitative match of two
independent measurements gives us a level of confidence in both the
resistivity data and the TDR calibration.

To check for degradation effects, a sample was intentionally exposed to
air for an hour and the measurements were repeated, as shown in the
lower inset in Fig. 1. After the exposure, the sample surface lost its
shiny metallic glass and the total frequency shift through the
transition (proportional to the sample surface area A) decreased. This
reduction without affecting the transition temperature and width
suggests that the degradation happens on the surface and the
superconductivity of our samples is bulk in nature.

$\Delta\lambda_{\rm ab}(T)$ in three LiFeAs crystals is shown up to
T_(c)/3 in Fig. 2 by solid dots. $\Delta\lambda_{\rm ab}(T)$ was
analyzed using (1) power-law, Δλ(T) = AT^(α) (with A and n being free
parameters), as expected for nodal superconductors, and (2) exponential
BCS form,
$\Delta\lambda(T)=\tilde{\lambda}_{0}\sqrt{\pi\,\Delta_{0}/2T}\exp{(-\Delta_{0} /T)}$
(with λ̃₀ and Δ₀ as free parameters). The best-fit results for sample 1
are shown with solid (power-law) and dashed (exponential) lines. The fit
residuals are shown in the inset. The quality of the exponential and of
the power-law fits are equally good, although Δ₀/T_(c) = 1.09 ± 0.02 is
smaller than the value of 1.76 expected for a conventional single gap
s-wave pairing, and λ̃₀ = 280 ± 15 nm is somewhat larger than the
experimental 200 nm.[45, 60] This is naturally explained by two-gap
superconductivity in LiFeAs. The superconducting T_(c) and best-fit
parameters (obtained from fitting up to T_(c)/3) for all samples are
summarized in Table 1. $T_{c}^{\rm onset}$ was defined at 90

for sample 2 (crosses). Analysis (shown for sample 1) was done assuming
both power-law (solid lines) and exponential (dashed line) 7
dependences. The data for samples 2 and 3 (shifted vertically for
clarity by 10 and 20 nm, respectively) were analyzed in a similar way
(see Table 1). Inset: comparison of the fit residuals for sample 1 for

n as a free parameter, while A was obtained with a fixed n = 3.1
(average of the three samples). Crosses in Fig. 2 show Δλ_(c, mix)(T)
for sample 2. A clear saturation of Δλ_(c, mix)(T) at low temperatures
suggests the exponential behavior of λ_(c). Thermal contraction is ruled
out, as it would only give a total change of about 1 nm from 0 to T_(c)
(Ref. [46]) and it could only lead to a nonexponential behavior.

Figure 3(a) shows Δλ(T) versus T^(a) with n = 3.1, which is the average
exponent for the three samples. The dependence of the parameters, n and
A, on the fitting temperature range is summarized in Figs. 3(b) and
3(c), respectively. As expected, the exponent n is more scattered for
the shortest fit interval, otherwise n and A do not depend much on the
fitting range from base temperature to 6 K and give n > 3 for all
samples, with the average value 3.13 ± 0.23. With n fixed at this
average value, we determined the prefactor A = 107.8 ± 2.1 pm/K^(3.1).

The superfluid density ρ_(s)(T) = [1 + Δλ(T)/λ(0)]⁻² is the quantity to
compare with the calculations for different gap structures. Figure 4
shows ρ_(s)(T) for sample 1 calculated with λ(0) = 200 nm [45, 60]. A
noticeable positive curvature above T_(c)/2 is similar to other Fe-based
superconductors [61] and MgB₂[62] suggesting multigap superconductivity.
We analyze ρ_(s)(T) in the framework of the self-consistent γ model
[54]. LiFeAs is a compensated metal with a two-dimensional cylindrical
hole and somewhat warped electron Fermi surface sheets [47, 48]. To
reduce the number of fitting parameters, yet capture the compensated
multiband structure, we consider the simplest model of two cylindrical
bands with the mass ratio μ = m₁/m₂, where the partial density of states
of the first band is n₁ = μ/(1 + μ). The total superfluid density is
ρ_(s) = γρ₁ + (1 − γ)ρ₂ with γ = 1/(1 + μ). We also use the Debye
temperature of 240 K (Ref. [51]) to calculate T_(c), which allows fixing
one of the in-band pairing potentials, λ₁₁. This leaves three free-fit
parameters: the second in-band potential λ₂₂, inter-band coupling λ₁₂,
and the mass ratio μ. Figure 4 shows that ρ_(s)(T) can be well described
in the entire temperature range by this clean-limit, weak-coupling BCS
model. In the fitting, the two gaps were calculated self-consistently
(which is the major difference between this model and the popular, but
not self-consistent, α model) [63], and the self-consistent Δ₁(T) and
Δ₂(T) are shown in the upper inset of Fig. 4, while the gap ratio is
shown in the lower inset indicating strong non-single-gap-BCS behavior
of the small gap. The best fit gives Δ₁(0)/T_(c) ∼ 1.885 and
Δ₂(0)/T_(c) ∼ 1.111. As expected, one of the gaps is larger, and the
other is smaller, than the single-gap value of 1.76, which is _always_
the case of a self-consistent two-gap solution. The best-fit parameters
are: λ₁₁ = 0.630, λ₂₂ = 0.642, λ₁₂ = 0.061, and μ = 1.384. The
determined mass ratio gives n₁ = 0.581 and γ = 0.419. This is consistent
with band structure calculations that yield n₁ = 0.57 and μ = 1.34,
(Ref. [64]) and ARPES experiments that find n ≈ 1.7 (Ref. [48]). The
effective coupling strength λ_(eff) = 0.374 is not far from 0.35
estimated for 122 (Ref. [65]) and 0.21 estimated for 1111 (Ref. [66])
pnictides. (The value of 0.21 is an upper limit for the total
electron-phonon interaction and the higher values would represent the
total strength of electron-boson coupling.) The electron band with a
smaller gap gives a contribution that is larger by a factor of about 1.5
to the total ρ_(s), resulting in a crossing of the partial densities at
low temperatures. A similar result was obtained from magnetization
measurements [49]. We stress that, while Δ₁(T), Δ₂(T), μ (hence, n₁, n₂,
and γ), and λ_(eff) are unique self-consistent solutions describing the
data, the coupling matrix λ_(ij) is not unique. There are other
combinations that could produce similar results and λ_(ij) has to be
calculated from first principles.

In conclusion, we find that in the clean limit, optimally doped Fe-based
superconductors are fully gapped, but most measurements are affected by
pair-breaking

scattering.[10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] This conclusion is in line
with studies of thermal conductivity (which is not as sensitive to
scattering) in BaCo122.[27, 28] On the other hand, intrinsic K122
reveals a nodal gap,[24, 25] which is also found in heavily overdoped
BaCo122.[28] Overall, this establishes a common trend for all Fe-based
superconductors to have a superconducting gap that evolves from full to
nodal when moving toward the edge of the superconducting dome.
