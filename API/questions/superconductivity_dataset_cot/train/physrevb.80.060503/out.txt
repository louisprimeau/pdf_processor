###### Abstract

We report ^{11}B NMR measurements in noncentrosymmetric superconductors Mg9_{3}Ir19_{16.7} (T_{c}=5.8 K) and Mg10_{10.5}Ir19_{17.1} (T_{c}=4.8 K). The spin-lattice relaxation rate and the Knight shift indicate that the Cooper pairs are predominantly in the spin-singlet state with an isotropic gap. However, Mg10_{10.5}Ir19_{17.1} is found to have more defects and the spin susceptibility remains finite even in the zero-temperature limit. We interpret this result as that the defects enhance the spin-orbit coupling and bring about more spin-triplet component.

## I Introduction

Superconductors without spatial inversion symmetry in the crystal structure have attracted much attention. In superconducting materials with an inversion center, the Cooper pairs are either in the spin-singlet state or in the spin-triplet state due to Pauli exclusion principle. However, when the inversion symmetry is broken, the spin-singlet and spin-triplet states can be mixed.[1, 2, 3] This was actually found in Li2Pt3B by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Ref. [4]) and other measurements.[5, 6] The extent of parity mixing depends on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) that is enhanced by the lack of inversion symmetry. In such materials, novel superconducting properties can be expected.[7, 8]

After the discovery of the noncentrosymmetric compound CePtSi,[9] many new superconductors of such kind have been discovered. They can be categorized into two types. Namely, the strong-correlated electron systems such as UIr,[10] CeRhSi3,[11] CeIrSi3,[12] and the weakly correlated electron systems that include Li2Pd3B and Li2Pt3B,[13, 14] Mg10Ir19B16,[15] Y(La)2-C3,[16, 17] Rh(Ir)2Ga9,[18, 19] and Ru3B,[20, 21] In the former class of materials, the electron correlations seem to play an important role in governing the superconducting properties. The latter class of materials is therefore more suitable for the study of the pure effects of inversion-symmetry breaking.

In this Rapid Communication, we present the results of NMR studies on the noncentrosymmetric superconductors Mg9_{3}Ir19_{16.7} (T_{c}=5.8 K) and Mg10_{10.5}Ir19_{19}B17_{1} (T_{c}=4.8 K). This material has a bcc crystal structure with the space group of \bar{4}3\bar{m}. There are two Mg sites, three Ir sites, and two B sites. Among them, Ir(3) site (24\pmg site), Mg(1) site (8\pmc site), and the two B sites do not have inversion center.[15, 22] In particular, Ir is a heavy element, which may lead to a large spin-orbit coupling. It has been reported that there is a wide range for stoichiometries; changing the stoichiometry only results in a small change in T_{c}-[15] Specific heat and photoemission measurements suggested s-wave gap.[23, 24, 25] but there are also indications of exotic pairing from tunneling spectroscopy and penetration depth measurements.[26, 27] Our results of spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T_{1}) and the Knight shift indicate that the Cooper pairs are predominantly in the spin-singlet state with an isotropic gap. However, Mg10_{10.5}Ir19_{17.1} is found to contain more defects and the Knight shift remains finite even in the zero-temperature limit. We interpret this result as that the defect enhances the spin-orbit coupling and brings about more spin-triplet component. Our result suggests that properly introducing defects could provide a new route to exotic superconducting state.

## II Experimental procedures and sample characterization

Two polycrystal samples with different nominal composition were prepared by the solid-state reaction method with starting materials of Mg (99.8% purity), Ir (99.99%), and B (99.7%).[24] The appropriate compositions of the starting materials powders were mixed and pressed into a pellet at a pressure of 1 GPa. Then the pellet was wrapped with Ta foil and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube, and sintered at 600 degC for 30 min and further at 950 degC for 3 h. The resultant pellet was well ground and pressed again, and finally was annealed at 950 degC for 12 h. The inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis shows that sample 1 has a formula of Mg9_{3}Ir19_{3}B16_{17} and sample 2 is Mg10_{3.5}Ir19_{3}B17_{1}. The uncertainty of the ICP analysis for the composition is about \pm0.1. The samples were also characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM) spectroscopy. The samples for TEM measurement were prepared by crushing the powders in ethanol, and the resultant suspensions were dispersed on a holey carbon-covered Cu grid. The TEM investigation was performed on a FEI Tecnai-F20 (200 kV) TEM.

For NMR measurements, the samples were crushed into powder. T_{c} at zero and a finite magnetic field (H) was determined by measuring the ac susceptibility using the _in situ_ NMR coil. Figure 1 shows the result for H=0. T_{c}(H=0) for Mg9_{3.1}Ir19_{16.7} is 5.8 K, which is a higher than the previous report by Klimczuk _et al._ for nominal composition Mg1_{2}Ir19_{3}B19 (T_{c}=5 K),[15] and T_{c}(H=0) for Mg10_{3.5}Ir19_{3}B17_{17.1} is 4.8 K. A standard phase-coherent pulsed NMR spectrometer was used to collect data. In order to minimize the reduction in T_{c} by H, the measurements were done at a low field of 0.44 T at which T_{c} was reduced to 4.11 and 3.45 K for the two samples, respectively. The ^{11}B NMR spectra were obtained by fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the spin echo and were found to have a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 4.6 kHz. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate, 1/T_{1}  was measured by using a single saturation pulse and by fitting the nuclear magnetization to a single exponential function since the quadrupole interaction is absent. Measurements below 1.4 K were carried out in a ^{3}He refrigerator. Efforts were made to avoid possible heating by the RF pulse, such as using a small-amplitude RF pulse.

## III Results and Discussions

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of 1/T_{1} for the two samples. As can be seen clearly in the figure, 1/T_{1} is enhanced just below T_{c} over its normal-state value, forming a so-called coherence peak (Hebel-Slichter peak), which is a hallmark of an isotropic superconducting gap. Figure 3 shows 1/T_{1} normalized by its value at T_{c} against the reduced temperature, which compares the height of Hebel-Slichter peak of the two samples. The 1/T_{15} in the superconducting state is expressed as \frac{T_{1/N}}{T_{15}}=\frac{2}{k_{B}T_{c}}\int(1+\frac{\Delta^{2}}{EE^{2}})N_{s}(E)N_{s}(E^{*})f(E)[1-f(E^{*})]\delta(E-E^{*})dEdE^{*} where 1/T_{1N} is the relaxation rate in the normal state, N_{s}(E) is the superconducting density of states (DOS), f(E) is the Fermi distribution function and C =1+\frac{\Delta^{2}}{E^{2}} is the "coherence factor." Following Hebel,[28] we convolute N_{s}(E) with a broadening function B(E), which is approximated with a rectangular function centered at E with a height of 1/2\delta. The solid curves below T_{c} shown in Figs. 2 and 3 are calculations with 2\Delta(0)=3.0k_{B}T_{c} and r=\Delta(0)/\delta =5 for Mg_{9.3}Ir_{9}B_{16.7}, and 2\Delta(0)=2.2k_{B}T_{c} and r=3 for Mg_{10.3}Ir_{9}B_{17.1}. The smaller \Delta(0) than the BCS value is probably too the applied field. In Li_{2}Pd_{3}B, a smaller 2\Delta(0)=2.2k_{B}T_{c} at a field of 1.46 T (Ref. [29]) recovers to 3.0 k_{B}T_{c} at a smaller field of 0.44 T.[30]

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the ^{11}B Knight shift. Above T_{c}, the shift is temperature independent,

The solid curve below T_{c} for Mg_{9.3}Ir_{9}B_{16.7} and the broken curve for Mg_{10.3}Ir_{9}B_{17.1} are calculations assuming purely singlet pairing. The solid curve for Mg_{10.3}Ir_{9}B_{17.1} is a fit assuming mixing triplet and singlet pairings (see text for detail).

The arrows indicate the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} under the magnetic field of 0.44 T. The curves below T_{c} are fits to the BCS theory with 2\Delta_{0}=3.0k_{B}T_{c} (high-T_{c} sample) and 2.2k_{B}T_{c} (low-T_{c} sample), respectively. The broken lines above T_{c} indicate the 1/T_{1}\approxT relation.

  while it changes below T_{c}. The observed Knight shift (K_{orb}) is composed of the spin part (K_{s}) and the orbital part (K_{orb}), K_{obs}=K_{s}+K_{orb}. K_{orb} is T independent, and K_{s} is proportional to X_{s}, K_{s}=A_{s/X}, where A_{s/i} is the hyperfine coupling between the nuclear and electron spins. In both samples, the shift increases below T_{c}. This indicates the decrease of \chi_{s} in the superconducting state since the hyperfine coupling constant is negative as seen in Li_{2}Pd_{3}B.[29] Thus the spin pairing in Mg-Ir-B systems is in the spin-singlet state. This is quite different from the case of Li_{2}Pt_{3}B.[4] although Ir and Pt are located next to each other in the periodic table. The difference is probably due to the fact that only 12/19 of Ir atoms sits in the noncentrosymmetric position. The solid curve below T_{c} for Mg_{10.3}Ir_{19}B_{16.7} and the broken curve for Mg_{10.3}Ir_{19}B_{17.1} in Fig. 4 are calculations assuming purely singlet pairing, \chi_{s}=-4\mu_{B}^{2}N_{s}(E)\frac{e^{\beta(\beta)}}{4E}dE, with the same gap parameter obtained from T_{1} taking. In performing the fitting, K_{orb}=0.010% is assumed. It is a reasonable assumption that K_{orb} does not depend on the composition. The experimental results thus indicate that there remains a finite spin susceptibility at T=0 for Mg_{10.3}Ir_{19}B_{17.1}.

What is the origin of the finite spin susceptibility at T =0? We argue that defect or disorder is responsible for the finite spin susceptibility. Given that Mg_{9.3}Ir_{19}B_{16.7} has a higher T_{c}, it can be assumed that this composition is close to the optimal stoichiometry. Then, the sample Mg_{10.5}Ir_{19}B_{17.1} can be viewed as Ir deficient. TEM image supports that Mg_{10.3}Ir_{19}B_{17.1} has more defects.

Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show, respectively, the electron-diffraction patterns taken along [110], [001] zone-axis directions of the Mg_{9.3}Ir_{19}B_{16.7} sample. All the diffraction spots in these patterns can be well indexed using the expected cubic unit cell with lattice parameters of a=10.57 A (space group of I\overline{4}3m). In contrast, the electron-diffraction patterns of Mg_{10.5}Ir_{19}B_{17.1} always contain additional weak reflection spots following each fundamental spot, suggesting that this sample contains a rich variety of defect structure. Further HRTEM (high-resolution TEM) study suggests that these additional reflection spots are caused by Moire fringes and occurrence of local structural distortion in the sample. Figure 5(c) gives a typical electron-diffraction pattern taken along [110] zone-axis direction of Mg_{10.5}Ir_{19}B_{17.1}. Figure 5(d) shows a corresponding HRTEM image. The inset of Fig. 5(d) is the Fourier spectrum obtained by FFT, in which one of the extra spots is indicated by the arrow. Further careful FFT analysis indicates that the extra spots arise from the area marked as "B," which contains defect structure.

Now, in the presence of defect/disorder, there are two mechanisms that can give rise to the finite spin susceptibility. One is spin-reversal scattering by the impurity/disorder as pointed out by Anderson.[31] The other is mixing of the spin-triplet component due to enhanced spin-orbit coupling caused by defects. For spin-triplet superconductivity, the spin susceptibility does not decrease below T_{c} or changes little, depending on the magnetic field configuration with respect to the d vector that characterizes the triplet pairing. In the former case, the isotropic scattering would reduce the gap anisotropy and would lead to an enhancement of the Hebel-Slichter peak, as was evidenced in Zn-doped Al.[32] However, this is not seen experimentally. In fact, as can be seen in Fig. 3, the peak height is smaller in the low-T_{c} sample Mg_{10.5}Ir_{19}B_{17.1}. Also, it seems hard to attribute a difference of 1 K in T_{c} to nonmagnetic impurity/defect in an s-wave superconductor.

We propose that the latter scenario, namely, the intrinsic effect of the defect that enhances SOC is more likely. The SOC is described by the Hamiltonian,

\[H_{SO}=\frac{\hbar^{2}}{4m^{2}c^{2}[\vec{\nabla}V(r)\times\vec{k}]\vec{ \sigma}},\] (1)

where \vec{k} and \vec{\sigma} are the electron momentum and Pauli-spin operator, respectively, and \vec{\nabla}V(r) is the electrical field. In addition to the broken inversion symmetry, a vacancy of Ir can also increase \vec{\nabla}V(r). In particular, vacancies occupying the original centrosymmetric Ir(1) and Ir(2) sites will result in inversion-symmetry breaking for these sites and enhance the SOC. The SOC lifts the twofold spin degeneracy of the electron bands. As a result, the spin-singlet and spin-triplet states are mixed.[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] The extent to which the triplet-state component is mixed depends on the strength of SOC.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] We propose that the finite spin susceptibility in Mg_{10.5}Ir_{19}B_{17.1} is due to such SOC that is enhanced by Ir vacancy. The solid curve in Fig. 4 for Mg_{10.5}Ir_{19}B_{17.1} is a fit assuming mixing triplet and singlet pairings, with finite K_{s}=0.005% due to triplet component, and the other K_{s} due to singlet component with 2\Delta(0)=2.2k_{B}T_{c}.

## IV Concluding remarks

In conclusion, we have presented the results of extensive NMR measurements on noncentrosymmetric superconductors Mg_{9.3}Ir_{19}B_{16.7} (T_{c}=5.8 K) and Mg_{10.5}Ir_{19}B_{17.1} (T_{c} =4.8 K). The spin-lattice relaxation rate shows a coherence

  peak just below T_{c} and follows an exponential T variation at low temperatures. The spin susceptibility measured by the Knight shift decreases below T_{c}. These results indicate that the Cooper pairs are predominantly in the spin-singlet state with an isotropic gap. This is likely due to the fact that only 12/19 of Ir atoms sits in the noncentrosymmetric position. However, Mg_{10.5}Ir_{10}B_{17.1} is found to have more defects and the spin susceptibility remains finite even in the zero-temperature limit. We propose that the defect enhances the spin-orbit coupling and brings about more spin-triplet component. We note that this mechanism may provide an alternative route to exotic superconducting state.

###### Abstract

We report ^{11}B NMR measurements in noncentrosymmetric superconductors Mg9_{3}Ir19_{16.7} (T_{c}=5.8 K) and Mg10_{10.5}Ir19_{17.1} (T_{c}=4.8 K).

## I Introduction

Superconductors without spatial inversion symmetry in the crystal structure have attracted much attention. In superconducting materials with an inversion center, the Cooper pairs are either in the spin-singlet state or in the spin-triplet state due to Pauli exclusion principle. However, when the inversion symmetry is broken, the spin-singlet and spin-triplet states can be mixed.[1, 2, 3] This was actually found in Li2Pt3B by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Ref. [4]) and other measurements.[5, 6] The extent of parity mixing depends on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) that is enhanced by the lack of inversion symmetry. In such materials, novel superconducting properties can be expected.[7, 8]

After the discovery of the noncentrosymmetric compound CePtSi,[9] many new superconductors of such kind have been discovered. They can be categorized into two types. Namely, the strong-correlated electron systems such as UIr,[10] CeRhSi3,[11] CeIrSi3,[12] and the weakly correlated electron systems that include Li2Pd3B and Li2Pt3B,[13, 14] Mg10Ir19B16,[15] Y(La)2-C3,[16, 17] Rh(Ir)2Ga9,[18, 19] and Ru3B,[20, 21] In the former class of materials, the electron correlations seem to play an important role in governing the superconducting properties. The latter class of materials is therefore more suitable for the study of the pure effects of inversion-symmetry breaking.

In this Rapid Communication, we present the results of NMR studies on the noncentrosymmetric superconductors Mg9_{3}Ir19_{16.7} (T_{c}=5.8 K) and Mg10_{10.5}Ir19_{19}B17_{1} (T_{c}=4.8 K). This material has a bcc crystal structure with the space group of \bar{4}3\bar{m}. There are two Mg sites, three Ir sites, and two B sites. Among them, Ir(3) site (24\pmg site), Mg(1) site (8\pmc site), and the two B sites do not have inversion center.[15, 22] In particular, Ir is a heavy element, which may lead to a large spin-orbit coupling. It has been reported that there is a wide range for stoichiometries; changing the stoichiometry only results in a small change in T_{c}-[15] Specific heat and photoemission measurements suggested s-wave gap.[23, 24, 25] but there are also indications of exotic pairing from tunneling spectroscopy and penetration depth measurements.[26, 27] Our results of spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T_{1}) and the Knight shift indicate that the Cooper pairs are predominantly in the spin-singlet state with an isotropic gap. However, Mg10_{10.5}Ir19_{17.1} is found to contain more defects and the Knight shift remains finite even in the zero-temperature limit. We interpret this result as that the defect enhances the spin-orbit coupling and brings about more spin-triplet component. Our result suggests that properly introducing defects could provide a new route to exotic superconducting state.

## II Experimental procedures and sample characterization

Two polycrystal samples with different nominal composition were prepared by the solid-state reaction method with starting materials of Mg (99.8% purity), Ir (99.99%), and B (99.7%).[24] The appropriate compositions of the starting materials powders were mixed and pressed into a pellet at a pressure of 1 GPa. Then the pellet was wrapped with Ta foil and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube, and sintered at 600 degC for 30 min and further at 950 degC for 3 h. The resultant pellet was well ground and pressed again, and finally was annealed at 950 degC for 12 h. The inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis shows that sample 1 has a formula of Mg9_{3}Ir19_{3}B16_{17} and sample 2 is Mg10_{3.5}Ir19_{3}B17_{1}. The uncertainty of the ICP analysis for the composition is about \pm0.1. The samples were also characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM) spectroscopy. The samples for TEM measurement were prepared by crushing the powders in ethanol, and the resultant suspensions were dispersed on a holey carbon-covered Cu grid. The TEM investigation was performed on a FEI Tecnai-F20 (200 kV) TEM.

For NMR measurements, the samples were crushed into powder. T_{c} at zero and a finite magnetic field (H) was determined by measuring the ac susceptibility using the _in situ_ NMR coil. Figure 1 shows the result for H=0. T_{c}(H=0) for Mg9_{3.1}Ir19_{16.7} is 5.8 K, which is a higher than the previous report by Klimczuk _et al._ for nominal composition Mg1_{2}Ir19_{3}B19 (T_{c}=5 K),[15] and T_{c}(H=0) for Mg10_{3.5}Ir19_{3}B17_{17.1} is 4.8 K. A standard phase-coherent pulsed NMR spectrometer was used to collect data. In order to minimize the reduction in T_{c} by H, the measurements were done at a low field of 0.44 T at which T_{c} was reduced to 4.11 and 3.45 K for the two samples, respectively. The ^{11}B NMR spectra were obtained by fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the spin echo and were found to have a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 4.6 kHz. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate, 1/T_{1}  was measured by using a single saturation pulse and by fitting the nuclear magnetization to a single exponential function since the quadrupole interaction is absent. Measurements below 1.4 K were carried out in a ^{3}He refrigerator. Efforts were made to avoid possible heating by the RF pulse, such as using a small-amplitude RF pulse.

## III Results and Discussions

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of 1/T_{1} for the two samples. As can be seen clearly in the figure, 1/T_{1} is enhanced just below T_{c} over its normal-state value, forming a so-called coherence peak (Hebel-Slichter peak), which is a hallmark of an isotropic superconducting gap. Figure 3 shows 1/T_{1} normalized by its value at T_{c} against the reduced temperature, which compares the height of Hebel-Slichter peak of the two samples. The 1/T_{15} in the superconducting state is expressed as \frac{T_{1/N}}{T_{15}}=\frac{2}{k_{B}T_{c}}\int(1+\frac{\Delta^{2}}{EE^{2}})N_{s}(E)N_{s}(E^{*})f(E)[1-f(E^{*})]\delta(E-E^{*})dEdE^{*} where 1/T_{1N} is the relaxation rate in the normal state, N_{s}(E) is the superconducting density of states (DOS), f(E) is the Fermi distribution function and C =1+\frac{\Delta^{2}}{E^{2}} is the "coherence factor." Following Hebel,[28] we convolute N_{s}(E) with a broadening function B(E), which is approximated with a rectangular function centered at E with a height of 1/2\delta. The solid curves below T_{c} shown in Figs. 2 and 3 are calculations with 2\Delta(0)=3.0k_{B}T_{c} and r=\Delta(0)/\delta =5 for Mg_{9.3}Ir_{9}B_{16.7}, and 2\Delta(0)=2.2k_{B}T_{c} and r=3 for Mg_{10.3}Ir_{9}B_{17.1}. The smaller \Delta(0) than the BCS value is probably too the applied field. In Li_{2}Pd_{3}B, a smaller 2\Delta(0)=2.2k_{B}T_{c} at a field of 1.46 T (Ref. [29]) recovers to 3.0 k_{B}T_{c} at a smaller field of 0.44 T.[30]

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the ^{11}B Knight shift. Above T_{c}, the shift is temperature independent,

The solid curve below T_{c} for Mg_{9.3}Ir_{9}B_{16.7} and the broken curve for Mg_{10.3}Ir_{9}B_{17.1} are calculations assuming purely singlet pairing. The solid curve for Mg_{10.3}Ir_{9}B_{17.1} is a fit assuming mixing triplet and singlet pairings (see text for detail).

The arrows indicate the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} under the magnetic field of 0.44 T. The curves below T_{c} are fits to the BCS theory with 2\Delta_{0}=3.0k_{B}T_{c} (high-T_{c} sample) and 2.2k_{B}T_{c} (low-T_{c} sample), respectively. The broken lines above T_{c} indicate the 1/T_{1}\approxT relation.

  while it changes below T_{c}. The observed Knight shift (K_{orb}) is composed of the spin part (K_{s}) and the orbital part (K_{orb}), K_{obs}=K_{s}+K_{orb}. K_{orb} is T independent, and K_{s} is proportional to X_{s}, K_{s}=A_{s/X}, where A_{s/i} is the hyperfine coupling between the nuclear and electron spins. In both samples, the shift increases below T_{c}. This indicates the decrease of \chi_{s} in the superconducting state since the hyperfine coupling constant is negative as seen in Li_{2}Pd_{3}B.[29] Thus the spin pairing in Mg-Ir-B systems is in the spin-singlet state. This is quite different from the case of Li_{2}Pt_{3}B.[4] although Ir and Pt are located next to each other in the periodic table. The difference is probably due to the fact that only 12/19 of Ir atoms sits in the noncentrosymmetric position. The solid curve below T_{c} for Mg_{10.3}Ir_{19}B_{16.7} and the broken curve for Mg_{10.3}Ir_{19}B_{17.1} in Fig. 4 are calculations assuming purely singlet pairing, \chi_{s}=-4\mu_{B}^{2}N_{s}(E)\frac{e^{\beta(\beta)}}{4E}dE, with the same gap parameter obtained from T_{1} taking. In performing the fitting, K_{orb}=0.010% is assumed. It is a reasonable assumption that K_{orb} does not depend on the composition. The experimental results thus indicate that there remains a finite spin susceptibility at T=0 for Mg_{10.3}Ir_{19}B_{17.1}.

What is the origin of the finite spin susceptibility at T =0? We argue that defect or disorder is responsible for the finite spin susceptibility. Given that Mg_{9.3}Ir_{19}B_{16.7} has a higher T_{c}, it can be assumed that this composition is close to the optimal stoichiometry. Then, the sample Mg_{10.5}Ir_{19}B_{17.1} can be viewed as Ir deficient. TEM image supports that Mg_{10.3}Ir_{19}B_{17.1} has more defects.

Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show, respectively, the electron-diffraction patterns taken along [110], [001] zone-axis directions of the Mg_{9.3}Ir_{19}B_{16.7} sample. All the diffraction spots in these patterns can be well indexed using the expected cubic unit cell with lattice parameters of a=10.57 A (space group of I\overline{4}3m). In contrast, the electron-diffraction patterns of Mg_{10.5}Ir_{19}B_{17.1} always contain additional weak reflection spots following each fundamental spot, suggesting that this sample contains a rich variety of defect structure. Further HRTEM (high-resolution TEM) study suggests that these additional reflection spots are caused by Moire fringes and occurrence of local structural distortion in the sample. Figure 5(c) gives a typical electron-diffraction pattern taken along [110] zone-axis direction of Mg_{10.5}Ir_{19}B_{17.1}. Figure 5(d) shows a corresponding HRTEM image. The inset of Fig. 5(d) is the Fourier spectrum obtained by FFT, in which one of the extra spots is indicated by the arrow. Further careful FFT analysis indicates that the extra spots arise from the area marked as "B," which contains defect structure.

Now, in the presence of defect/disorder, there are two mechanisms that can give rise to the finite spin susceptibility. One is spin-reversal scattering by the impurity/disorder as pointed out by Anderson.[31] The other is mixing of the spin-triplet component due to enhanced spin-orbit coupling caused by defects. For spin-triplet superconductivity, the spin susceptibility does not decrease below T_{c} or changes little, depending on the magnetic field configuration with respect to the d vector that characterizes the triplet pairing. In the former case, the isotropic scattering would reduce the gap anisotropy and would lead to an enhancement of the Hebel-Slichter peak, as was evidenced in Zn-doped Al.[32] However, this is not seen experimentally. In fact, as can be seen in Fig. 3, the peak height is smaller in the low-T_{c} sample Mg_{10.5}Ir_{19}B_{17.1}. Also, it seems hard to attribute a difference of 1 K in T_{c} to nonmagnetic impurity/defect in an s-wave superconductor.

We propose that the latter scenario, namely, the intrinsic effect of the defect that enhances SOC is more likely. The SOC is described by the Hamiltonian,

\[H_{SO}=\frac{\hbar^{2}}{4m^{2}c^{2}[\vec{\nabla}V(r)\times\vec{k}]\vec{ \sigma}},\] (1)

where \vec{k} and \vec{\sigma} are the electron momentum and Pauli-spin operator, respectively, and \vec{\nabla}V(r) is the electrical field. In addition to the broken inversion symmetry, a vacancy of Ir can also increase \vec{\nabla}V(r). In particular, vacancies occupying the original centrosymmetric Ir(1) and Ir(2) sites will result in inversion-symmetry breaking for these sites and enhance the SOC. The SOC lifts the twofold spin degeneracy of the electron bands. As a result, the spin-singlet and spin-triplet states are mixed.[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] The extent to which the triplet-state component is mixed depends on the strength of SOC.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] We propose that the finite spin susceptibility in Mg_{10.5}Ir_{19}B_{17.1} is due to such SOC that is enhanced by Ir vacancy. The solid curve in Fig. 4 for Mg_{10.5}Ir_{19}B_{17.1} is a fit assuming mixing triplet and singlet pairings, with finite K_{s}=0.005% due to triplet component, and the other K_{s} due to singlet component with 2\Delta(0)=2.2k_{B}T_{c}.

## IV Concluding remarks

In conclusion, we have presented the results of extensive NMR measurements on noncentrosymmetric superconductors Mg_{9.3}Ir_{19}B_{16.7} (T_{c}=5.8 K) and Mg_{10.5}Ir_{19}B_{17.1} (T_{c} =4.8 K). The spin-lattice relaxation rate shows a coherence

  peak just below T_{c} and follows an exponential T variation at low temperatures. The spin susceptibility measured by the Knight shift decreases below T_{c}. These results indicate that the Cooper pairs are predominantly in the spin-singlet state with an isotropic gap. This is likely due to the fact that only 12/19 of Ir atoms sits in the noncentrosymmetric position. However, Mg_{10.5}Ir_{10}B_{17.1} is found to have more defects and the spin susceptibility remains finite even in the zero-temperature limit. We propose that the defect enhances the spin-orbit coupling and brings about more spin-triplet component. We note that this mechanism may provide an alternative route to exotic superconducting state.
