###### Abstract

We compare magnetotransport of the three iron-arsenide-based compounds
ReFeAsO (Re=La, Sm, Nd) in very high DC and pulsed magnetic fields up to
45 and 54 T, respectively. Each sample studied exhibits a
superconducting transition temperature near the maximum reported to date
for that particular compound. While high magnetic fields do not suppress
the superconducting state appreciably, the resistivity, Hall
coefficient, and critical magnetic fields, taken together, suggest that
the phenomenology and superconducting parameters of the oxypnictide
superconductors bridges the gap between MgB₂ and YBCO.

The recently discovered layered superconducting oxypnictides with high
transition temperatures [1] are based on alternating structures of FeAs
and ReO layers. Similar to the high-temperature superconducting
cuprates, superconductivity in oxypnictides seem to emerge upon doping
of a parent antiferromagnetic state. As the ReO planes are doped, the
ionically bonded ReO donates an electron to the covalently bonded FeAs
plane [2], suppressing the global antiferromagnetism and resulting in
superconductivity. Different rare earths do, however, have an effect on
the superconducting transition temperature, T_(c), which increases from
a maximum of 28 K for La (Refs. [2] and [3]) to above 40 K for Ce (Ref.
[4]) and above 50 K for Nd, Pr, Sm, and Gd, respectively [5, 6, 7, 8].
Unlike the cuprates, the doping required for the onset of
superconductivity, as well as the doping at optimal T_(c), seems to
depend on the specific rare earth in the compound, perhaps for intrinsic
reasons such as a varying the magnetic moment or size of the rare-earth
atom, or a possible role of multiple bands.

To deduce common behaviors of the oxypnictide superconductors, we
studied three of the iron-arsenide-based compounds ReFeAsO (Re=La, Sm,
Nd) in very high magnetic fields. All samples measured were polycrystals
made by solid-state synthesis. Two were doped by partial F substitution
for O (La and Nd) and one (Sm) by forcing an O deficiency. The
SmFeAsO_(0.85) (Ref. [9]) and NdFeAsO_(0.94)F_(0.06)[5] exhibiting a 90

Phase diagrams for fluorine-doping [13, 14, 1] have been reported for
each compound: our LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) and SmFeAsO_(0.85) samples are
deemed optimally doped based upon the maximal value of T_(c) in the
published _F_-doped phase diagrams, which is consistent with the nominal
_F_-doping level for our samples [13, 14, 1]. It is important to note,
however, that the actual doping of polycrystalline samples can be
difficult to determine precisely. For example, the nominal doping of x=
0.06 in our NdFeAsO_(0.94)F_(0.06) sample is anomalously low in light of
the published phase diagram, for which an experimental value of
T_(c)=50.5 K corresponds to the maximum value of T_(c), which is
reported to occur at an F doping of around 11

The longitudinal resistivity ρ_(xx) and the Hall coefficient R_(H) in
high magnetic fields were measured using a lock-in technique in three
different high-field magnets at the National High Magnetic Field
Laboratory (NHMFL): 33 T DC resistive and 45 T hybrid magnets at Florida
State University, and 54 T pulsed magnets at Los Alamos National
Laboratory. For each experiment, the samples were nominally rectangular
prisms and the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the largest
face of the samples. Six electrical contacts (using either DuPont silver
paint or Epo-tek H20 E silver epoxy) were positioned around the
perimeter of the sample in a conventional Hall bar geometry.

Figure 1(a) shows ρ_(xx) as a function of temperature T at B = 0 for the
LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11), SmFeAsO_(0.85), and NdFeAsO_(0.94)F_(0.06)
samples. LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) exhibits a conventional superlinear T
dependence of ρ_(xx)(T). A magnetic field suppresses superconductivity
by shifting the resistive transition to lower T, reducing T_(c) by
roughly a factor of two with 30 T, as shown in Fig. 1(b).

SmFeAsO_(0.85) and NdFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.06) show strikingly different
behavior that is more reminiscent of the high-temperature
superconducting cuprates: a linear temperature dependence of ρ_(xx)(T),
from 225 K down to T_(c) and a substantial broadening of the resistive
transition in a magnetic field: applying 33 T has little effect on the
high-temperature superconductivity onset, while the foot of the
transition is shifted to substantially lower temperature as shown in
Figs. 1(c) and 1(d).

The field dependencies of the Hall resistivity ρ_(xy) are shown in Figs.
2(a)-2(c) for the La, Sm, and Nd compounds, respectively, over a wide
temperature range above T_(c). The low-temperature behavior of the La
compound at T< 100 K in Fig. 2(a) is rather conventional: ρ_(xy) is
linear in B and is temperature independent. If only one band contributes
to current transport, the Hall coefficient, R_(H)=ρ_(xy)/B = 1/_ne_,
yields a carrier density n of 0.07 electrons per unit formula in the La
compound at low temperatures. Here we used reported unit-cell parameters
[15] with two unit formulas per unit cell. This value is not far from
the nominal doping of x = 0.1 per unit formula.

At higher T all three compounds exhibit a strong temperature dependence
of ρ_(xy) as is evident in Figs. 2(a)-2(c). Note, however, that all
traces in Fig. 2 retain a linear dependence on B regardless of
temperatures. The observed strictly linear field dependence of ρ_(xy)
and no magnetoresistance at temperatures 70-200 K indicates that
ω_(c)τ≈1, where ω_(c) = eB/m^(*) is the cyclotron frequency and τ is the
scattering time. At the same time the observed temperature dependence of
R_(H) may indicate two-band effects.

A number of experimental [16; 17; 18] and theoretical [19; 20; 21]
papers have discussed the oxypnictides as a two-band system. In this
case, the primary effect of high magnetic fields is the lateral
separation of electronlike and holelike carriers. Often ρ_(xy) for a
semimetal is not a linear function of H due to the complexity of the
transport in the presence of two different carriers. The field
dependence of R_(H) for a two-band system [22]

$$R_{H}=\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}R_{1}+\sigma_{2}^{2}R_{2}+\sigma_{1}^{2}\sigma_{2}^ {2}R_{1}R_{2}(R_{1}+R_{2})B^{2}}{(\sigma_{1}+\sigma_{2})^{2}+\sigma_{1}^{2} \sigma_{2}^{2}(R_{1}+R_{2})^{2}B^{2}}$$

becomes noticeable as the parameter ω_(c)τ=B/B₀ becomes of the order of
unity provided that R₁∼R₂ and σ₁∼σ₂. Here B₀=ρ_(xx)/R_(H), the indices 1
and 2 correspond to bands 1 and 2, R_(1, 2) and σ_(1, 2)=1/ρ_(1, 2) are
intraband Hall coefficients and conductivities, respectively, and ρ_(xx)
is determined by the minimum value of ρ₁ and ρ₂ in the parallel band
connection. Taking the characteristic values of ρ_(xx)≈ 1 m Ω cm and
R_(H) = 5× 10⁻³ cm³/C from Figs. 1 and 2, we get B₀=2000 T, indicating
that ω_(c)τ≫1 only at inaccessible magnetic fields H>1000 T. The same
field B₀ sets the scale for the onset of magnetoresistance. Note that in
Fig. 1, there is no significant

temperatures which may result from eddy current heating in this
relatively big sample. (f) ρ_(xx)(B, T)/ρ_(n)(T) of Sm sample versus B

magnetoresistance above T_(c), where the zero-field data (black line)
superimpose data taken in magnetic fields. Thus, the observed
temperature dependence of R_(H) is consistent with a two-band system at
ω_(c)τ≪1 for both bands with no visible magnetoresistance and the Hall
resistivity ρ_(xy)=B(σ₁²R₁ + σ₂²R₂)/(σ₁ + σ₂)² linear in B.

Figure 2(d) shows the marked temperature dependencies of R_(H), which
exhibit pronounced infections at temperatures marked by the three
arrows. These arrows indicate the temperatures at which a structural
phase transition has been reported for the three _undoped_ parent
compounds. Neutron data on undoped LaFeAsO show a transition from
tetragonal to monoclinic lattice around 150 K, followed by
antiferromagnetic ordering below 134 K.[23] SmFeAsO shows a tetragonal
to orthorhombic transition at 129 K.[24] For NdFeAsO, sharp jumps in
heat-capacity signal structural transition at ≈150 K.[25] Unlike the
pseudogap in the cuprates, doping of the parent compound only slightly
reduces the temperature of these anomalies in the oxypnictides as the
doping approaches the range in which superconductivity is observed.[1,
13, 14] The Hall data in Fig. 2 suggest that a remnant of the structural
transitions in the undoped parent compounds manifest themselves at
optimum doping as well; however, it is also possible that this results
from the presence of undoped phase in the samples. At the same time, the
overall temperature dependence of R_(H)(T) is not understood.

Finally, the high-field longitudinal resistivity measurements shown in
Fig. 1 enable a characterization of the magnetic-field scales required
to suppress superconductivity in the oxypnictides. Figure 3 shows three
characteristic fields H₉₀(T), H₈₀(T), and H₁₀(T) at which ρ_(xx)(T)
reaches 90

temperature independent, consistent with a dominant single-carrier
conduction mechanism, while at higher T all compounds show marked
ρ_(xy)(T) dependencies. (d) Hall coefficient determined from linear fits
to ρ_(xy)(H) for −33 < B< 33 T or 11.5 < B< 45 T (solid squares) and at
B=9 T (open triangles Ref. [3]). No systematic departure from linearity
was found regardless of temperature. Arrows show apparent infections on
R_(H)(T) dependence around T≈ 150 K, which may result from structural
transitions.

Shown in Fig. 3(b) are the magnetic fields H₉₀(T), H₅₀(T), and H₁₀(T)
normalized to the respective values of T_(c)^(*) for each compound and
plotted as functions of the reduced temperature t = T/T_(c). All H₉₀(T)
and H₁₀(T) data nearly collapse onto single curves, while the H₉₀(T)
data do not. This behavior suggests the following qualitative
interpretation. The upper critical fields H_(c2)^(*) ∼ϕ₀/2πξ_(a)^(*)
along the c axis and perpendicular to the c axis, H_(c2)^(*)
∼ϕ₀/2πξ_(a)ξ_(c) are defined by the respective coherence lengths, ξ_(a)
and ξ_(c) ∼ξ_(a)Γ^(−1/2), where Γ = ρ_(c)/ρ_(ab) is the effective mass
or resistivity anisotropy parameter. Given the nanoscale ξ_(a) and ξ_(c)
in oxypnictides, [16] we can assume that these materials even in the
present polycrystalline form are likely in the clean limit, ξ_(a) < ξ,
where ξ is the mean-free path. In this case ξ_(a) ∝ξ_(a) ∝ 1/T_(c),
which yields H_(c2)∝T_(c)², consistent with the scaling of H₉₀(T) and
H₁₀(T) curves defined by H_(c2)^(⊥) in Fig. 3(b)) for all three
compounds. In turn, the lack of scaling for H₉₀(T) defined by
H_(c2)^(⊥)(T) in Fig. 3(b) may indicate that, in addition to the change
in T_(c), the mass anisotropy parameter Γ also changes, as will be
discussed below.

Our high-field data enable us to make several further conclusions
regarding trends in superconducting oxypnictides. From the measured
R_(H)=1/_ne_ and the London penetration depth λ₀²=m^(*)/μ₀μe² at T=0, we
estimate the effective mass of the carriers m^(*) = μ₀eλ₀²/R_(H), where
e is the electron charge. Taking R_(H)=6.2 x 10⁻³ cm³/C at T_(c) from
Figs. 1 and 2 and λ₀=215 nm from NMR data, [27] we obtain m^(*)=1.6m_(e)
for LaFeAs(O,F) (or a slightly higher m^(*)=2.23m_(e) for λ₀ =254 nm
taken from μSR data [28]). For SmFeAsO, we take R_(H)= 2 x 10⁻⁹ m³/C
from Fig. 2 and λ₀=184 nm from μSR data, [29] which yields m^(*)=
3.7m_(e). The increase of m^(*) as T_(c) increases from 28 K for
LaFeAs(O,F) to 53.5 K for SmFeAsO may reflect the effective-mass
renormalization by strong-coupling effects. [30] The above one band
estimate can also be applied qualitatively to two-band systems, in which
either the ratios m₁/n₁ and m₂/n₂ are not too different, or σ₁ ≫σ₂. In
the latter case m^(*) corresponds to band 1, which effectively
short-circuits band 2. In turn, the ratio σ₁/σ₂ can be controlled by
disorder, as has been shown for MgB₂. [31]

The relative effects of vortex fluctuations can be inferred from the
data of Fig. 1. As mentioned previously, the R(T) curve for LaFeAs(O,F)
mostly shifts to lower temperatures without much change in shape upon
increasing H. This behavior is characteristic of the resistive
transition in low-T_(c) superconductors with weak thermal fluctuations
of vortices. By contrast, the R(T) curves for the higher-T_(c)
oxypnictides in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d) broaden significantly as H
increases, similar to the behavior of the cuprates. This indicates that
thermal fluctuations of vortices in SmFeAsO and NdFeAs(O,F) appear to be
much stronger than in LaFeAs(O,F). The effect of thermal fluctuations is
quantified by the Ginzburg parameter, Gi = (2 πR_(B)T_(c)μ₀λ₀²/ϕ₀²)²/2,
ξ_(c) = ξ_(c)Γ^(−1/2) is the coherence length along the c axis, Γ =
m_(e)/m_(a) is the mass anisotropy parameter in a uniaxial crystal. [32]

For LaFeAs(O,F), ξ_(c) can be estimated from the zero-temperature
H_(c2)^(∥)(0) = ϕ₀/2πξ_(a)ξ_(c), which yields ξ_(c) =
[ϕ₀/2πH_(c2)^(⊥)(0)(Γ)^(1/2)= 1.2 nm for Γ=15(Ref. [33]) and
H_(c2)^(⊥)(0) = 60 T. [16] In this case Gi = 3.4 x 10⁻⁴ is only 50

The relatively small value of Gi in the La compound indicates that the
melting field of the vortex lattice, H_(m)(T) is not too different from
H_(c2). [16] However, for Sm and Nd compounds, the difference between
H_(m) and H_(c2)^(⊥) becomes more pronounced because of the much larger
Ginzburg numbers. In this case H_(m) ≪H_(c2), even for a moderately
anisotropic superconductor, for which

$$H_{m}=aH_{c2}(0)\frac{T_{c}^{2}}{T_{c}^{2}}\bigg{(}1-\frac{T}{T_{c}}\bigg{)}^{2}.$$
(2)

Here a = π²c_(L)⁴/Gi, and c_(L) = 0.17 is the Lindemann number for the
vortex lattice. [32] Taking the above-estimated value of Gi ∼ 1.3 x 10⁻²
for SmFeAsO, we obtain a ∼ 0.63. Here the melting field H_(m)(T)
exhibits an upward curvature near T_(c) where H_(m)(T) is significantly
smaller than H_(c2)(T) =
$H_{  unexplained behaviors of the high-\(T_{c}$ cuprates.
