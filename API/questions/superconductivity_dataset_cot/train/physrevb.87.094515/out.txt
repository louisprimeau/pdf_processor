###### Abstract

The in-plane magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{m}(T) was measured in a single crystal of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} superconductor in a dilution refrigerator down to T=60 mK and in magnetic fields up to H_{dc}=1 T by using a tunnel diode resonator. The London penetration depth \lambda saturates exponentially approaching T\to 0 indicating fully gapped superconductivity. The thermodynamic Rutgers formula was used to estimate \lambda(0)=426\pm 60 nm which was used to calculate the superfluid density, \rho_{s}(T)=\lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T). Analysis of \rho_{s}(T) in the full temperature range shows that it is best described by a single-gap behavior, perhaps with somewhat stronger coupling. In a magnetic field, the measured penetration depth is given by the Campbell penetration depth which was used to calculate the theoretical critical current density j_{c}. For H\leqslant 0.45 T, the strongest pinning is achieved not at the lowest, but at some intermediate temperature, probably due to matching effect between temperature-dependent coherence length and relevant pinning length scale. Finally, we find compelling evidence for surface superconductivity. Combining all measurements, the entire H-T phase diagram of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} is constructed with an estimated H_{c2}(0)=0.4817 T.

## 1 Introduction

Superconductivity in the tetragonal ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} was discovered first in polycrystalline samples [1] and later in single crystals [2] with the superconducting phase transition temperature (T_{c}) at 3.0 and 2.7 K, respectively. The upper critical field (H_{c2}) was estimated to be 4920 Oe at T=0 by using Helfand-Werthamer (HW) theory [3] based on the experimental data obtained only down to T=0.7T_{c}. [2] It has been found that T_{c} and H_{c2} can be slightly increased by chemical doping. [4] The London penetration depth and coherence length were reported to be \lambda(0)=566 nm and \xi(0)=21 nm (Ref. [5]) and \lambda(0)=345\pm 30 nm \xi(0)=25.6\pm 0.5 nm. [6] These values give the Ginzburg-Landau parameter of \kappa=27 (Ref. [5]) and \kappa=13.5 (Ref. [6]), which makes SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} a strong type-II superconductor. Furthermore, thermodynamic [2] and tunneling spectroscopy measurements are consistent with a strong-coupling s-wave Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductor with the zero-temperature value of the superconducting gap of \Delta_{0}\approx 2k_{B}T_{c}. [5, 6]--slightly higher but not far from the weak-coupling value of 1.76.

This superconductor is interesting particularly because of compositional similarity to the isostructural Fe-and Ni-pnictide superconductors with comparable T_{c} such as KFe_{2}As_{2}, BaNi_{2}As_{2}, and SrNi_{2}P_{2}. Although there is strong experimental evidence for nodal superconductivity in KFe_{2}As_{2} (Refs. [7] and [8]), the Ni-based compounds have been shown to be fully gapped by thermodynamic and thermal transport measurements. [9, 10] This naturally prompts the question: what is the structure of a superconducting gap in SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}? So far, not much work has been done on SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} in this direction. Tunneling spectroscopy between 0.17T_{c} and T_{c} is consistent with a single, isotropic gap superconductor. [5] However, the thermodynamic, thermal transport, and penetration depth measurements down to much lower temperatures are necessary to provide objective conclusions regarding the gap symmetry in SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}.

The magnetic penetration depth is among the most useful probes to explore the superconducting state. [11] In zero external magnetic field, this represents the London penetration depth. If measured with sufficient accuracy and down to low enough temperatures, it can be used to understand the angular variation of the superconducting gap on the Fermi surface. [11, 12] In the presence of vortices, the magnetic field penetration includes contribution of the Campbell penetration depth which depends on the elastic properties of vortex lattice and is linked directly to the critical current density. [13] There has been only limited work performed in the mixed state of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}[6, 14] and no studies of the critical current density over the full temperature and field range.

In this article we report precision tunnel diode resonator measurements of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{m}(T) in a single crystal of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} (T_{c}=2.7 K) performed in a dilution refrigerator with temperatures down to T\approx 0.02T_{c} and in magnetic fields up to 1 T \approx 2H_{c2}(0). The low-temperature variation of the London penetration depth, \Delta\lambda(T), clearly shows exponential saturation. The thermodynamic Rutgers formula was used to estimate \lambda(0)=426\pm 60 nm which was used to calculate the superfluid density, \rho_{s}(T)=\lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T). Analysis of \rho_{s}(T) in the full temperature range shows that it is best described by a single-gap behavior, perhaps with somewhat strong coupling. The upper critical field, H_{c2}(0)=0.4817 T was determined by the HW theory from the field sweeps at different temperatures down to 0.02T_{c}. In finite magnetic fields, H<H_{c2}(0), the Campbell penetration depth \lambda_{C}(T,H) shows a minimum at an intermediate temperature (rather than at the lowest temperature) which indicates nonmonotonic variation of the theoretical critical current (j_{c}) calculated from \lambda_{C}(T,H). Additional diamagnetic response detected above H_{c2}(T) is consistent with surface superconductivity with H_{c3}(T)=1.695H_{c2}(T). [15]

## 2 Experiment

Single crystals of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} were grown using a self-flux method as described in Ref. [2]. The magnetic penetration depth was measured in a dilution refrigerator by using a tunnel diode resonator (TDR) technique (for review, see Ref. [11]). The sample with dimensions (0.51 x 0.70 x 0.04) mm^{3} with the shortest direction being along the c axis was mounted on a sapphire rod and inserted into a 2-mm-inner-diameter copper coil that produces rf excitation field with empty-resonator frequency of 17 MHz with amplitude H_{ac}\sim 20 mOe, much smaller than H_{c1} of typical conventional superconductors. Measurements of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth were done with both H_{dc} and H_{ac}lc axis. The shift of the resonant frequency (in cgs units), \Delta f(T)=-G4\pi\chi(T), where \chi(T) is the differential magnetic susceptibility, G=f_{0}V_{s}/2V_{c}(1-N) is a constant, N is the demagnetization factor, V_{s} is the sample volume, and V_{c} is the coil volume. The constant G was determined from the full frequency change by physically pulling the sample out of the coil. With the characteristic sample size R, 4\pi\chi=(\lambda/R)\tanh(R/\lambda)-1, from which \Delta\lambda can be obtained.[11, 16]

## III Results and Discussion

### London penetration depth

Figure 1 shows temperature variation of the in-plane London penetration depth, \Delta\lambda(T), measured in a single crystal of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} superconductor which exhibits a very sharp superconducting phase transition at T_{c}=2.7 K as shown in the inset, indicating a high quality, homogeneous sample. In the main panel, \Delta\lambda(T) is shown with temperatures up to about 0.67T_{c}. The saturation in T\to 0 limit and almost flat temperature dependence, \Delta\lambda(T_{c}/\lambda)<10 nm, indicate fully gapped superconductivity. Experimental \Delta\lambda(T) is best fit to a power-law function, \Delta\lambda(T)=AT^{n}, with the exponent of n=2.7\pm 0.1 and prefactor of A=12.2\pm 0.4 nm/K.[27] The fitting curve is shown by the red solid line. A power-law function with such a high exponent has very weak variation at low temperatures, indistinguishable from the exponential behavior which is predicted for a full superconducting gap. In fact, the BCS low-temperature form, \Delta\lambda(T)=\lambda(0)\sqrt{\pi\,\Delta_{0}/2k_{B}T}\exp{(-\Delta_{0}/k_{ B}T)}, where \Delta_{0} is the maximum gap value at T=0, fits the data equally well for T<T_{c}/3 where it is expected to be valid. However, the best fitting is achieved with \lambda(0)=50 nm and \Delta_{0}=0.74k_{B}T_{c}. The latter is impossible in the single-gap clean limit where \Delta_{0}\approx 1.76k_{B}T_{c} is expected. The value of \lambda(0) is also much smaller than the reported value of 566 nm.[5] Similar low-temperature features can be seen in two-band superconductors such as MgB_{2},[17]2H-NbSe_{2},[18] Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5},[19] and more recently LiFeAs.[20] However, as we show below, analysis of the superfluid density in the full temperature range is inconsistent with a two-gap clean limit behavior. Instead, it is more likely that we are dealing with moderate pair-breaking scattering (maybe due to well-known magnetic impurities in Pd) which results in a finite density of states inside the gap. We also point out that total temperature variation of London penetration depth up to T_{c}/3 in SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} is much smaller than in a known nodal superconductor with similar T_{c}, KFe_{2}As_{2},[7] see Fig. 1. This difference indicates a difference in the density of quasi-particle excitations due to a difference in the nodal gap structure.

For a metallic sample, the measured penetration depth above T_{c} is determined either by the skin depth \delta or sample size. In the case of skin depth limiting, the value of \lambda(T>T_{c}) shown in the inset of Fig. 1 is one-half of the actual skin depth.[21] Therefore, we can estimate normal-state resistivity from the measurements using \rho=(2\pi\omega/c^{2})\delta[20]. For SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} with \omega/2\pi=f_{0}=17 MHz and \delta/2\approx 20\mum, the calculated resistivity is approximately 12 \mu\Omega cm which is much less than the experimental value of 68\mu\Omega cm.[2] Therefore, we conclude that our measurements are taken in a sample-size limited regime. Using the same equation, the estimated skin depth is 0.10 mm which means the rf field penetration is comparable to the dimensions of the sample.

Finally, we note that the data exhibit a smooth transition from superconducting penetration depth to the normal state between T=T_{c} and T^{*}\approx 3.0 K, which has also been seen in transport measurement.[2] Interestingly, T^{*}=3 K is the onset of superconductivity observed in polycrystalline samples.[1] A similar feature has also been observed in a related superconductor BaNi_{2}As_{2}.[22] Perhaps this feature requires further study.

### Superfluid density

While the low-temperature behavior is important for characterization of the gap minima, the superconducting gap can be probed at all energies by the analysis of the superfluid density, \rho_{s}(T)=\lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T), in the entire temperature range.[12] However, determination of \rho_{s} requires knowledge of the absolute value of \lambda(0) which does not come from our measurements. In SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}, \lambda(0)=40 nm was suggested from measured band structure parameters in the clean limit,[5] which leads to \lambda(0)=566 nm in the dirty limit. Also, \lambda(0)\approx 390 nm was estimated from the upper critical field measurements,[2] and \lambda(0)=345\pm 5 nm from first field penetration value.[6] The variation of the literature values is quite significant and

Solid and dashed lines show power-law and BCS (single-gap s-wave) low-temperature fits. Dotted line shows the data for KFe_{2}As_{2} taken from Ref. [7] for comparison. Inset: London penetration depth for temperatures between 1.5 K and 3.3 K demonstrating a sharp transition at T_{c}=2.7 K.

  below we use, thermodynamic approach based on the Rutgers formula,[23] relating various superconducting state parameters at T_{c}. This formula was adapted for the use with the superfluid density by Kogan[24] as briefly described here. In the Ginzburg-Landau regime, i.e. near T_{c}, it is straightforward to show that

\[\left|\frac{\partial\rho_{s}}{\partial t}\right|_{T_{c}}=\frac{16\pi^{2}\lambda ^{2}(0)}{\phi_{0}|\partial H_{c2}/\partial T|_{T_{c}}}\Delta C_{p},\] (1)

where \phi_{0}=2.07\times 10^{-7} G cm^{2} is a flux quantum and |\partial H_{c2}/\partial T|_{T_{c}}=0.26 T/K is determined experimentally (see Fig. 8 below). Specific-heat jump \Delta C_{p}=7381 erg/cm^{3} K is taken from Ref. [4]. Applying these thermodynamic values suggests |\partial\rho/\partial t|_{T_{c}}/\lambda^{2}(0)=21.7\mum^{-2} where t=T/T_{c} is the reduced temperature. This quantity can be compared with the actual slope of calculated \rho_{s}(t) with various \lambda(0) at T_{c} as shown in Fig. 2. In the main panel of Fig. 2, the open symbols represent the superfluid density calculated using \lambda(0)=300,400, and 700 nm for triangles, circles, and squares, respectively. The dashed lines are determined with the slope calculated by Eq. (1) for the three values of \lambda(0) quoted above. The line for \lambda(0)=400 nm shows very good agreement with calculated \rho_{s} while the line for \lambda(0)=300 nm significantly underestimates, and the one for \lambda(0)=700 nm overestimates \rho_{s}(T). This procedure can be repeated with various values of \lambda(0). The results are summarized in the inset where the solid triangles represent experimental slopes obtained by fitting experimental data near T_{c} to a linear function. The gray horizontal band represents the theoretical value of |\partial\rho/\partial t|_{T_{c}}/\lambda^{2}(0)=21.7\pm 2.2\mum^{-2} determined with a 5% hypothetical error in |\partial H_{c2}/\partial T|_{T_{c}} and \Delta C_{p}. In this way, \lambda(0) can be determined at the intersection of the theoretical line and experimental results, which provides that \lambda(0)=426\pm 60 nm that lies between the literature values. With this value, the slope of \rho_{s} at T_{c} is determined to be -3.9.

The superfluid density calculated with \lambda(0)=426 nm is shown in Fig. 3. The dash-dotted and dashed lines show the expectation for the clean and dirty limits of a single-gap BCS superconductor in the weak-coupling limit, respectively. An attempt to use a two-gap (clean) \gamma model[25] in the full-temperature range converges to a single-gap limit with \Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=2.2. Therefore, the superconducting gap of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} is best represented by a single-gap s-wave function, perhaps with somewhat enhanced coupling strength. It was noted previously that the shape of \rho_{s}(T) is close to a nonlocal-limiting case, expected in type-I superconductors such as aluminum and cadmium.[26] A similar argument was made in the work by Kim _et al._ in which SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} appeared to be type I according to the intrinsic electronic structure despite the fact that experimental \xi(0) and \lambda(0) values put it in a strong type-II regime.[5] In any case, our study confirms that simple analysis with an isotropic Fermi surface is not sufficient and, perhaps, the results could be explained by taking into account a realistic band structure. We can, however, conclude that the superconducting gap of SrPd_{2}As_{2} does not have nodes.

### Campbell penetration depth

Figure 4(a) shows magnetic penetration depth \Delta\lambda_{m}(T,H) as a function of temperature and magnetic field measured after cooling without magnetic field to target low temperature and then applying a dc magnetic field of indicated amplitude [zero-field cooled (ZFC): solid lines] and upon cooling in field (FC: dashed lines). Increasing dc magnetic field not only suppresses the superconducting phase transition and diamagnetic shielding, but also induces another diamagnetic phase between the normal state and apparent bulk superconductivity. This feature appears much clearer above H=0.2 T and persists at least up to H=0.6 T which is far greater than the upper critical field of the bulk superconductivity. This feature can hardly

The dash-dotted and dashed lines represent single-gap weak-coupling s-wave BCS superconductor in clean and dirty limit, respectively.

Figure 2: (Color online) Main panel: Calculated superfluid density \rho_{s} with various \lambda(0)’s. The slope of dashed lines was determined with \Delta C_{p} and |dH_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}} using the Rutgers formula as described in the text. Inset: Variation of |\partial\rho_{s}/\partial t|_{T_{c}}/\lambda^{2}(0) with varying \lambda(0). Here \rho_{s} was determined from the experimental data. The gray band is a theoretical estimate with 5% hypothetical error in \Delta C_{p} and |dH_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}}.

  be understood with sample inhomogeneity or second phases since they both should affect the measurements in zero field. Systematic tracking of this feature reveals its possible connection to surface superconductivity, which will be discussed later together with the general H-T phase diagram. In addition to temperature sweeps at fixed dc magnetic fields, magnetic field sweeps at different fixed temperatures were performed, and superconducting transitions are clearly detected as shown in Fig. 4(b). The determined bulk H_{c2}(T) is consistent with T_{c}(H) determined from the temperature scans. We note that the anomaly above H_{c2}(T) was not detected in the field sweep measurements.

Another unusual experimental observation is apparently the nonmonotonic temperature variation of \Delta\lambda_{m}(T,H) for 0.02 T \leqslant H\leqslant 0.4 T in both ZFC and FC data. The minima of \Delta\lambda_{m}(T,H) are marked by open circles for clarity in Fig. 4(a), and the locations of these minima are nearly the same for both ZFC and FC data. This feature is too shallow to be due to paramagnetic impurities (in which case it should be most pronounced at H=0).[27] We suggest that this behavior is caused by the size matching of the temperature-dependent coherence length and relevant pinning centers. Furthermore, we observed the inversion of diamagnetic screening between ZFC and FC runs at about H=0.2 T. The only way to obtain a difference between FC and ZFC experiments in ac response is to assume a nonparabolic pinning potential[28] and our results would indicate that the effective pinning potential shape is strongly field and temperature dependent. Conventional superconductors, like YbSb_{2} (Ref. [29]) do not exhibit such upturns in a magnetic field.

In the approximation of a linear elastic response of a vortex lattice to a small-amplitude ac perturbation (which is the case here), the total magnetic penetration depth can be expressed as a sum of Meissner and vortex contributions, which are represented by the London and Campbell penetration depths, respectively, \lambda_{m}^{2}=\lambda^{2}+\lambda_{C}^{2}.[13, 30, 31] Since we know \lambda from the measurements in zero field, we can readily calculate \lambda_{C}. At first glance, the field dependence of the Campbell penetration depth, shown in Fig. 5, appears sublinear, \sqrt{H}, as expected in conventional superconductors. However, nonmonotonic behavior is revealed upon closer inspection as shown in the inset. This nonmonotonic behavior at low fields originates from nonmonotonic temperature dependence of \lambda_{m} discussed above.

### Theoretical critical current

We distinguish theoretical critical current, which is a parameter entering the simple expression for the Campbell penetration depth, \frac{4\pi}{\alpha}j_{c}=r_{p}\phi_{0}/\lambda_{C}^{2} from the actual critical current that is affected by intervortex interactions and from the measured critical (persistent) current that is further affected by magnetic relaxation. Here r_{p} is a characteristic radius of the pinning potential. We assume the r_{p} to be equal to the coherence length \xi(T)=\sqrt{\phi_{0}/2\pi\,H_{c2}(T)}. Obtained theoretical critical current density is shown in Fig. 6(a) as function of temperature at different fields and in Fig. 6(b) as a function of applied fields at different temperatures. The critical current is nonmonotonic as a function of temperature, showing maximum at the intermediate temperatures. We attribute this to the matching between temperature-dependent coherence length and pinning landscape. This assertion is plausible given monotonic behavior of the critical current versus field where the variation of the coherence length is much weaker.[32] Comparison with the previous works also reaffirms that we are dealing with the upper theoretical estimate of the critical current, approximately four times larger than evaluated from the magnetic measurements.[14] On the other

  hand, direct comparison with our data, Fig. 8, shows that the line of the maximum current density found in this work is not an extension of the irreversibility line found in Ref. [14] and probably represents a crossover in the pinning mechanism reflected in the change of the effective pinning potential.

Unfortunately literature data are only available for higher temperatures, above T=2 K, and for weak fields less than H=0.1 T, so we do not know whether the nonmonotonic behavior of j_{c}(T) propagates to the relaxed persistent current density. Furthermore, our evaluation of the coherence length, \xi(T) (right axis in Fig. 7), allows experimental determination of the temperature-dependent Ginzburg-Landau parameter, \kappa(T)=\lambda(T)/\xi(T), shown in Fig. 7 (left axis). The result is compared with the Gor'kov theory [33] where temperature correction is introduced as A_{G}(T)=\kappa(T)/\kappa(T_{c}). The trend is correct, but the magnitude of the variation is smaller then the observed. If we attempt to rescale the Gor'kov's result, the best agreement at the intermediate temperatures is achieved with \kappa(T)=\kappa(T_{c})[2.6A_{G}(T)-1.6]. Perhaps a better agreement could be achieved with a realistic band structure.

### H-T phase diagram

Finally, a H-T phase diagram is established based on the measured \Delta\lambda_{m}(T,H) as shown in Fig. 8. Open and solid circles represent bulk superconducting phase transitions determined from temperature- and field-sweep measurements, respectively. The upper critical field was determined at the maximum of d\,\Delta\lambda/dT and d\,\Delta f/dH in temperature- and field-sweep experiments in Fig. 4, respectively. The red solid line through the symbols is the HW fit [3] with H_{c2}(0)=0.4817 T. This value was determined with the experimental data down to 0.02T_{c} in our study, and it is very close to the estimated value H_{c2}(0)=0.4920 T in Ref. [2] only with the the slope at T_{c} by using the same theory. This is a good indication that H_{c2}(T) of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} is orbital limited.

The additional diamagnetic phase between bulk T_{c} and normal state detected in temperature sweeps is marked by open squares. This phase transition is clearest in magnetic fields between 0.2 and 0.6 T. A linear fit through these squares

Figure 8: (Color online) H-T phase diagram of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}. Open and solid circles represent bulk superconducting transition, H_{c2}(T), determined by temperature and field sweeps, respectively. Red solid line is fitting over experimental H_{c2}(T) using the HW theory. Open squares indicate the temperatures where diamagnetic response was detected above bulk T_{c}. Red dashed line represents H_{c3}=1.695H_{c2}(T). Open triangles with black dash-dotted linear fit line show maximum of the pinning. For comparison, we include the data for H_{c2} (green stars) and a crossover from vortex liquid to vortex glass phase (violet solid line) from Ref. [14].

Figure 6: (Color online) Calculated theoretical critical current (a) as a function of temperature in different magnetic fields and (b) as a function of magnetic field at fixed temperatures. Inset in (b) displays \Delta j_{c}(T,H)=j_{c}(T,H)-j_{c}(0.06K,H) to show the maximum j_{c} being at a intermediate temperature.

Figure 7: (Color online) Calculated Ginzburg-Landau parameter, \kappa(T)=\lambda(T)/\xi(T) (symbols, left axis) compared to the Gor’kov prediction, \kappa(T)=\kappa\left(T_{c}\right)A_{G}(T) (solid line) and to modified to best fit the data expression, \kappa\left(T\right)=\kappa\left(T_{c}\right)(2.6A_{G}(T)-1.6) (dashed line). Right axis shows estimated coherence length.

  extrapolates down to almost H_{c2}(T_{c}) and up to 1 T where the diamagnetic phase was not seen. It is well known that surface superconductivity boundary is given by H_{c3}(T)=1.695H_{c2}(T).[15] This curve fits well the diamagnetic feature observed in our experiments, so it makes sense to assign it to surface superconductivity.

The region of the strongest pinning, where the theoretical critical current is maximum, is marked in Fig. 8 with solid triangles with linear fit dashed-dotted line. This region lies deep inside the superconducting state and is probably due to the matching effect. For comparison, we include the data for H_{c2} (green stars) and for a crossover from vortex liquid to vortex glass phase (violet solid line), both estimated from the magnetization measurements.[14] The upper critical field is in a good agreement with our data. The liquid-glass crossover line, on the other hand, does not extrapolate to the line of the strong pinning found in our measurements (although there is no overlapping temperature interval). This indicates that the maximum theoretical critical current line is not an extension of the irreversibility line and represents a different crossover in the pinning mechanism reflected in the nonmonotonic change in the shape of the pinning potential.

## IV Summary

Temperature- and magnetic-field-dependent penetration depth was measured in single crystals of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} superconductor by using a tunnel diode resonator technique. For H=0, the London penetration depth saturates at low temperatures indicating a fully gapped superconductivity in SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}. The calculated superfluid density is best described by a single-gap s-wave superconductor, perhaps slightly on the stronger coupling side. The H_{c2}(T) was measured down to 0.02T_{c} and could be well described by the HW theory with H_{c2}(0)=0.4817 T and is clearly limited by the orbital depairing. In the magnetic fields between 0.2 and 0.6 T, another diamagnetic phase different from bulk superconductivity is clearly seen, and this phase line is consistent with the surface superconductivity bound by the third critical field, H_{c3}=1.695H_{c2}. The Campbell penetration depth and the theoretical critical current density both exhibit nonmonotonic behavior with the strongest pinning at intermediate temperatures. We assign maximum pinning to matching effects between the temperature-dependent coherence length and the relevant pinning landscape length scale.

###### Abstract

The in-plane magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{m}(T) was measured in a single crystal of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} superconductor in a dilution refrigerator down to T=60 mK and in magnetic fields up to H_{dc}=1 T by using a tunnel diode resonator. The London penetration depth \lambda saturates exponentially approaching T\to 0 indicating fully gapped superconductivity. The thermodynamic Rutgers formula was used to estimate \lambda(0)=426\pm 60 nm which was used to calculate the superfluid density, \rho_{s}(T)=\lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T). Analysis of \rho_{s}(T) in the full temperature range shows that it is best described by a single-gap behavior, perhaps with somewhat stronger coupling. In a magnetic field, the measured penetration depth is given by the Campbell penetration depth which was used to calculate the theoretical critical current density j_{c}. For H\leqslant 0.45 T, the strongest pinning is achieved not at the lowest, but at some intermediate temperature, probably due to matching effect between temperature-dependent coherence length and relevant pinning length scale. Finally, we find compelling evidence for surface superconductivity. Combining all measurements, the entire H-T phase diagram of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} is constructed with an estimated H_{c2}(0)=0.4817 T.

## 1 Introduction

Superconductivity in the tetragonal ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} was discovered first in polycrystalline samples [1] and later in single crystals [2] with the superconducting phase transition temperature (T_{c}) at 3.0 and 2.7 K, respectively. The upper critical field (H_{c2}) was estimated to be 4920 Oe at T=0 by using Helfand-Werthamer (HW) theory [3] based on the experimental data obtained only down to T=0.7T_{c}. [2] It has been found that T_{c} and H_{c2} can be slightly increased by chemical doping. [4] The London penetration depth and coherence length were reported to be \lambda(0)=566 nm and \xi(0)=21 nm (Ref. [5]) and \lambda(0)=345\pm 30 nm \xi(0)=25.6\pm 0.5 nm. [6] These values give the Ginzburg-Landau parameter of \kappa=27 (Ref. [5]) and \kappa=13.5 (Ref. [6]), which makes SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} a strong type-II superconductor. Furthermore, thermodynamic [2] and tunneling spectroscopy measurements are consistent with a strong-coupling s-wave Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductor with the zero-temperature value of the superconducting gap of \Delta_{0}\approx 2k_{B}T_{c}. [5, 6]--slightly higher but not far from the weak-coupling value of 1.76.

This superconductor is interesting particularly because of compositional similarity to the isostructural Fe-and Ni-pnictide superconductors with comparable T_{c} such as KFe_{2}As_{2}, BaNi_{2}As_{2}, and SrNi_{2}P_{2}. Although there is strong experimental evidence for nodal superconductivity in KFe_{2}As_{2} (Refs. [7] and [8]), the Ni-based compounds have been shown to be fully gapped by thermodynamic and thermal transport measurements. [9, 10] This naturally prompts the question: what is the structure of a superconducting gap in SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}? So far, not much work has been done on SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} in this direction. Tunneling spectroscopy between 0.17T_{c} and T_{c} is consistent with a single, isotropic gap superconductor. [5] However, the thermodynamic, thermal transport, and penetration depth measurements down to much lower temperatures are necessary to provide objective conclusions regarding the gap symmetry in SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}.

The magnetic penetration depth is among the most useful probes to explore the superconducting state. [11] In zero external magnetic field, this represents the London penetration depth. If measured with sufficient accuracy and down to low enough temperatures, it can be used to understand the angular variation of the superconducting gap on the Fermi surface. [11, 12] In the presence of vortices, the magnetic field penetration includes contribution of the Campbell penetration depth which depends on the elastic properties of vortex lattice and is linked directly to the critical current density. [13] There has been only limited work performed in the mixed state of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}[6, 14] and no studies of the critical current density over the full temperature and field range.

In this article we report precision tunnel diode resonator measurements of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{m}(T) in a single crystal of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} (T_{c}=2.7 K) performed in a dilution refrigerator with temperatures down to T\approx 0.02T_{c} and in magnetic fields up to 1 T \approx 2H_{c2}(0). The low-temperature variation of the London penetration depth, \Delta\lambda(T), clearly shows exponential saturation. The thermodynamic Rutgers formula was used to estimate \lambda(0)=426\pm 60 nm which was used to calculate the superfluid density, \rho_{s}(T)=\lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T). Analysis of \rho_{s}(T) in the full temperature range shows that it is best described by a single-gap behavior, perhaps with somewhat strong coupling. The upper critical field, H_{c2}(0)=0.4817 T was determined by the HW theory from the field sweeps at different temperatures down to 0.02T_{c}. In finite magnetic fields, H<H_{c2}(0), the Campbell penetration depth \lambda_{C}(T,H) shows a minimum at an intermediate temperature (rather than at the lowest temperature) which indicates nonmonotonic variation of the theoretical critical current (j_{c}) calculated from \lambda_{C}(T,H). Additional diamagnetic response detected above H_{c2}(T) is consistent with surface superconductivity with H_{c3}(T)=1.695H_{c2}(T). [15]

## 2 Experiment

Single crystals of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} were grown using a self-flux method as described in Ref. [2]. The magnetic penetration depth was measured in a dilution refrigerator by using a tunnel diode resonator (TDR) technique (for review, see Ref. [11]). The sample with dimensions (0.51 x 0.70 x 0.04) mm^{3} with the shortest direction being along the c axis was mounted on a sapphire rod and inserted into a 2-mm-inner-diameter copper coil that produces rf excitation field with empty-resonator frequency of 17 MHz with amplitude H_{ac}\sim 20 mOe, much smaller than H_{c1} of typical conventional superconductors. Measurements of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth were done with both H_{dc} and H_{ac}lc axis. The shift of the resonant frequency (in cgs units), \Delta f(T)=-G4\pi\chi(T), where \chi(T) is the differential magnetic susceptibility, G=f_{0}V_{s}/2V_{c}(1-N) is a constant, N is the demagnetization factor, V_{s} is the sample volume, and V_{c} is the coil volume. The constant G was determined from the full frequency change by physically pulling the sample out of the coil. With the characteristic sample size R, 4\pi\chi=(\lambda/R)\tanh(R/\lambda)-1, from which \Delta\lambda can be obtained.[11, 16]

## III Results and Discussion

### London penetration depth

Figure 1 shows temperature variation of the in-plane London penetration depth, \Delta\lambda(T), measured in a single crystal of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} superconductor which exhibits a very sharp superconducting phase transition at T_{c}=2.7 K as shown in the inset, indicating a high quality, homogeneous sample. In the main panel, \Delta\lambda(T) is shown with temperatures up to about 0.67T_{c}. The saturation in T\to 0 limit and almost flat temperature dependence, \Delta\lambda(T_{c}/\lambda)<10 nm, indicate fully gapped superconductivity. Experimental \Delta\lambda(T) is best fit to a power-law function, \Delta\lambda(T)=AT^{n}, with the exponent of n=2.7\pm 0.1 and prefactor of A=12.2\pm 0.4 nm/K.[27] The fitting curve is shown by the red solid line. A power-law function with such a high exponent has very weak variation at low temperatures, indistinguishable from the exponential behavior which is predicted for a full superconducting gap. In fact, the BCS low-temperature form, \Delta\lambda(T)=\lambda(0)\sqrt{\pi\,\Delta_{0}/2k_{B}T}\exp{(-\Delta_{0}/k_{ B}T)}, where \Delta_{0} is the maximum gap value at T=0, fits the data equally well for T<T_{c}/3 where it is expected to be valid. However, the best fitting is achieved with \lambda(0)=50 nm and \Delta_{0}=0.74k_{B}T_{c}. The latter is impossible in the single-gap clean limit where \Delta_{0}\approx 1.76k_{B}T_{c} is expected. The value of \lambda(0) is also much smaller than the reported value of 566 nm.[5] Similar low-temperature features can be seen in two-band superconductors such as MgB_{2},[17]2H-NbSe_{2},[18] Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5},[19] and more recently LiFeAs.[20] However, as we show below, analysis of the superfluid density in the full temperature range is inconsistent with a two-gap clean limit behavior. Instead, it is more likely that we are dealing with moderate pair-breaking scattering (maybe due to well-known magnetic impurities in Pd) which results in a finite density of states inside the gap. We also point out that total temperature variation of London penetration depth up to T_{c}/3 in SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} is much smaller than in a known nodal superconductor with similar T_{c}, KFe_{2}As_{2},[7] see Fig. 1. This difference indicates a difference in the density of quasi-particle excitations due to a difference in the nodal gap structure.

For a metallic sample, the measured penetration depth above T_{c} is determined either by the skin depth \delta or sample size. In the case of skin depth limiting, the value of \lambda(T>T_{c}) shown in the inset of Fig. 1 is one-half of the actual skin depth.[21] Therefore, we can estimate normal-state resistivity from the measurements using \rho=(2\pi\omega/c^{2})\delta[20]. For SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} with \omega/2\pi=f_{0}=17 MHz and \delta/2\approx 20\mum, the calculated resistivity is approximately 12 \mu\Omega cm which is much less than the experimental value of 68\mu\Omega cm.[2] Therefore, we conclude that our measurements are taken in a sample-size limited regime. Using the same equation, the estimated skin depth is 0.10 mm which means the rf field penetration is comparable to the dimensions of the sample.

Finally, we note that the data exhibit a smooth transition from superconducting penetration depth to the normal state between T=T_{c} and T^{*}\approx 3.0 K, which has also been seen in transport measurement.[2] Interestingly, T^{*}=3 K is the onset of superconductivity observed in polycrystalline samples.[1] A similar feature has also been observed in a related superconductor BaNi_{2}As_{2}.[22] Perhaps this feature requires further study.

### Superfluid density

While the low-temperature behavior is important for characterization of the gap minima, the superconducting gap can be probed at all energies by the analysis of the superfluid density, \rho_{s}(T)=\lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T), in the entire temperature range.[12] However, determination of \rho_{s} requires knowledge of the absolute value of \lambda(0) which does not come from our measurements. In SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}, \lambda(0)=40 nm was suggested from measured band structure parameters in the clean limit,[5] which leads to \lambda(0)=566 nm in the dirty limit. Also, \lambda(0)\approx 390 nm was estimated from the upper critical field measurements,[2] and \lambda(0)=345\pm 5 nm from first field penetration value.[6] The variation of the literature values is quite significant and

Solid and dashed lines show power-law and BCS (single-gap s-wave) low-temperature fits. Dotted line shows the data for KFe_{2}As_{2} taken from Ref. [7] for comparison. Inset: London penetration depth for temperatures between 1.5 K and 3.3 K demonstrating a sharp transition at T_{c}=2.7 K.

  below we use, thermodynamic approach based on the Rutgers formula,[23] relating various superconducting state parameters at T_{c}. This formula was adapted for the use with the superfluid density by Kogan[24] as briefly described here. In the Ginzburg-Landau regime, i.e. near T_{c}, it is straightforward to show that

\[\left|\frac{\partial\rho_{s}}{\partial t}\right|_{T_{c}}=\frac{16\pi^{2}\lambda ^{2}(0)}{\phi_{0}|\partial H_{c2}/\partial T|_{T_{c}}}\Delta C_{p},\] (1)

where \phi_{0}=2.07\times 10^{-7} G cm^{2} is a flux quantum and |\partial H_{c2}/\partial T|_{T_{c}}=0.26 T/K is determined experimentally (see Fig. 8 below). Specific-heat jump \Delta C_{p}=7381 erg/cm^{3} K is taken from Ref. [4]. Applying these thermodynamic values suggests |\partial\rho/\partial t|_{T_{c}}/\lambda^{2}(0)=21.7\mum^{-2} where t=T/T_{c} is the reduced temperature. This quantity can be compared with the actual slope of calculated \rho_{s}(t) with various \lambda(0) at T_{c} as shown in Fig. 2. In the main panel of Fig. 2, the open symbols represent the superfluid density calculated using \lambda(0)=300,400, and 700 nm for triangles, circles, and squares, respectively. The dashed lines are determined with the slope calculated by Eq. (1) for the three values of \lambda(0) quoted above. The line for \lambda(0)=400 nm shows very good agreement with calculated \rho_{s} while the line for \lambda(0)=300 nm significantly underestimates, and the one for \lambda(0)=700 nm overestimates \rho_{s}(T). This procedure can be repeated with various values of \lambda(0). The results are summarized in the inset where the solid triangles represent experimental slopes obtained by fitting experimental data near T_{c} to a linear function. The gray horizontal band represents the theoretical value of |\partial\rho/\partial t|_{T_{c}}/\lambda^{2}(0)=21.7\pm 2.2\mum^{-2} determined with a 5% hypothetical error in |\partial H_{c2}/\partial T|_{T_{c}} and \Delta C_{p}. In this way, \lambda(0) can be determined at the intersection of the theoretical line and experimental results, which provides that \lambda(0)=426\pm 60 nm that lies between the literature values. With this value, the slope of \rho_{s} at T_{c} is determined to be -3.9.

The superfluid density calculated with \lambda(0)=426 nm is shown in Fig. 3. The dash-dotted and dashed lines show the expectation for the clean and dirty limits of a single-gap BCS superconductor in the weak-coupling limit, respectively. An attempt to use a two-gap (clean) \gamma model[25] in the full-temperature range converges to a single-gap limit with \Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=2.2. Therefore, the superconducting gap of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} is best represented by a single-gap s-wave function, perhaps with somewhat enhanced coupling strength. It was noted previously that the shape of \rho_{s}(T) is close to a nonlocal-limiting case, expected in type-I superconductors such as aluminum and cadmium.[26] A similar argument was made in the work by Kim _et al._ in which SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} appeared to be type I according to the intrinsic electronic structure despite the fact that experimental \xi(0) and \lambda(0) values put it in a strong type-II regime.[5] In any case, our study confirms that simple analysis with an isotropic Fermi surface is not sufficient and, perhaps, the results could be explained by taking into account a realistic band structure. We can, however, conclude that the superconducting gap of SrPd_{2}As_{2} does not have nodes.

### Campbell penetration depth

Figure 4(a) shows magnetic penetration depth \Delta\lambda_{m}(T,H) as a function of temperature and magnetic field measured after cooling without magnetic field to target low temperature and then applying a dc magnetic field of indicated amplitude [zero-field cooled (ZFC): solid lines] and upon cooling in field (FC: dashed lines). Increasing dc magnetic field not only suppresses the superconducting phase transition and diamagnetic shielding, but also induces another diamagnetic phase between the normal state and apparent bulk superconductivity. This feature appears much clearer above H=0.2 T and persists at least up to H=0.6 T which is far greater than the upper critical field of the bulk superconductivity. This feature can hardly

The dash-dotted and dashed lines represent single-gap weak-coupling s-wave BCS superconductor in clean and dirty limit, respectively.

Figure 2: (Color online) Main panel: Calculated superfluid density \rho_{s} with various \lambda(0)’s. The slope of dashed lines was determined with \Delta C_{p} and |dH_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}} using the Rutgers formula as described in the text. Inset: Variation of |\partial\rho_{s}/\partial t|_{T_{c}}/\lambda^{2}(0) with varying \lambda(0). Here \rho_{s} was determined from the experimental data. The gray band is a theoretical estimate with 5% hypothetical error in \Delta C_{p} and |dH_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}}.

  be understood with sample inhomogeneity or second phases since they both should affect the measurements in zero field. Systematic tracking of this feature reveals its possible connection to surface superconductivity, which will be discussed later together with the general H-T phase diagram. In addition to temperature sweeps at fixed dc magnetic fields, magnetic field sweeps at different fixed temperatures were performed, and superconducting transitions are clearly detected as shown in Fig. 4(b). The determined bulk H_{c2}(T) is consistent with T_{c}(H) determined from the temperature scans. We note that the anomaly above H_{c2}(T) was not detected in the field sweep measurements.

Another unusual experimental observation is apparently the nonmonotonic temperature variation of \Delta\lambda_{m}(T,H) for 0.02 T \leqslant H\leqslant 0.4 T in both ZFC and FC data. The minima of \Delta\lambda_{m}(T,H) are marked by open circles for clarity in Fig. 4(a), and the locations of these minima are nearly the same for both ZFC and FC data. This feature is too shallow to be due to paramagnetic impurities (in which case it should be most pronounced at H=0).[27] We suggest that this behavior is caused by the size matching of the temperature-dependent coherence length and relevant pinning centers. Furthermore, we observed the inversion of diamagnetic screening between ZFC and FC runs at about H=0.2 T. The only way to obtain a difference between FC and ZFC experiments in ac response is to assume a nonparabolic pinning potential[28] and our results would indicate that the effective pinning potential shape is strongly field and temperature dependent. Conventional superconductors, like YbSb_{2} (Ref. [29]) do not exhibit such upturns in a magnetic field.

In the approximation of a linear elastic response of a vortex lattice to a small-amplitude ac perturbation (which is the case here), the total magnetic penetration depth can be expressed as a sum of Meissner and vortex contributions, which are represented by the London and Campbell penetration depths, respectively, \lambda_{m}^{2}=\lambda^{2}+\lambda_{C}^{2}.[13, 30, 31] Since we know \lambda from the measurements in zero field, we can readily calculate \lambda_{C}. At first glance, the field dependence of the Campbell penetration depth, shown in Fig. 5, appears sublinear, \sqrt{H}, as expected in conventional superconductors. However, nonmonotonic behavior is revealed upon closer inspection as shown in the inset. This nonmonotonic behavior at low fields originates from nonmonotonic temperature dependence of \lambda_{m} discussed above.

### Theoretical critical current

We distinguish theoretical critical current, which is a parameter entering the simple expression for the Campbell penetration depth, \frac{4\pi}{\alpha}j_{c}=r_{p}\phi_{0}/\lambda_{C}^{2} from the actual critical current that is affected by intervortex interactions and from the measured critical (persistent) current that is further affected by magnetic relaxation. Here r_{p} is a characteristic radius of the pinning potential. We assume the r_{p} to be equal to the coherence length \xi(T)=\sqrt{\phi_{0}/2\pi\,H_{c2}(T)}. Obtained theoretical critical current density is shown in Fig. 6(a) as function of temperature at different fields and in Fig. 6(b) as a function of applied fields at different temperatures. The critical current is nonmonotonic as a function of temperature, showing maximum at the intermediate temperatures. We attribute this to the matching between temperature-dependent coherence length and pinning landscape. This assertion is plausible given monotonic behavior of the critical current versus field where the variation of the coherence length is much weaker.[32] Comparison with the previous works also reaffirms that we are dealing with the upper theoretical estimate of the critical current, approximately four times larger than evaluated from the magnetic measurements.[14] On the other

Open circles mark the minimum in \lambda_{m}(T) in each magnetic field. (b) Magnetic field sweeps at fixed temperatures.

  hand, direct comparison with our data, Fig. 8, shows that the line of the maximum current density found in this work is not an extension of the irreversibility line found in Ref. [14] and probably represents a crossover in the pinning mechanism reflected in the change of the effective pinning potential.

Unfortunately literature data are only available for higher temperatures, above T=2 K, and for weak fields less than H=0.1 T, so we do not know whether the nonmonotonic behavior of j_{c}(T) propagates to the relaxed persistent current density. Furthermore, our evaluation of the coherence length, \xi(T) (right axis in Fig. 7), allows experimental determination of the temperature-dependent Ginzburg-Landau parameter, \kappa(T)=\lambda(T)/\xi(T), shown in Fig. 7 (left axis). The result is compared with the Gor'kov theory [33] where temperature correction is introduced as A_{G}(T)=\kappa(T)/\kappa(T_{c}). The trend is correct, but the magnitude of the variation is smaller then the observed. If we attempt to rescale the Gor'kov's result, the best agreement at the intermediate temperatures is achieved with \kappa(T)=\kappa(T_{c})[2.6A_{G}(T)-1.6]. Perhaps a better agreement could be achieved with a realistic band structure.

### H-T phase diagram

Finally, a H-T phase diagram is established based on the measured \Delta\lambda_{m}(T,H) as shown in Fig. 8. Open and solid circles represent bulk superconducting phase transitions determined from temperature- and field-sweep measurements, respectively. The upper critical field was determined at the maximum of d\,\Delta\lambda/dT and d\,\Delta f/dH in temperature- and field-sweep experiments in Fig. 4, respectively. The red solid line through the symbols is the HW fit [3] with H_{c2}(0)=0.4817 T. This value was determined with the experimental data down to 0.02T_{c} in our study, and it is very close to the estimated value H_{c2}(0)=0.4920 T in Ref. [2] only with the the slope at T_{c} by using the same theory. This is a good indication that H_{c2}(T) of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} is orbital limited.

The additional diamagnetic phase between bulk T_{c} and normal state detected in temperature sweeps is marked by open squares. This phase transition is clearest in magnetic fields between 0.2 and 0.6 T. A linear fit through these squares

Red solid line is fitting over experimental H_{c2}(T) using the HW theory. Open squares indicate the temperatures where diamagnetic response was detected above bulk T_{c}. Red dashed line represents H_{c3}=1.695H_{c2}(T). Open triangles with black dash-dotted linear fit line show maximum of the pinning. For comparison, we include the data for H_{c2} (green stars) and a crossover from vortex liquid to vortex glass phase (violet solid line) from Ref. [14].

Inset in (b) displays \Delta j_{c}(T,H)=j_{c}(T,H)-j_{c}(0.06K,H) to show the maximum j_{c} being at a intermediate temperature.

Right axis shows estimated coherence length.

  extrapolates down to almost H_{c2}(T_{c}) and up to 1 T where the diamagnetic phase was not seen. It is well known that surface superconductivity boundary is given by H_{c3}(T)=1.695H_{c2}(T).[15] This curve fits well the diamagnetic feature observed in our experiments, so it makes sense to assign it to surface superconductivity.

The region of the strongest pinning, where the theoretical critical current is maximum, is marked in Fig. 8 with solid triangles with linear fit dashed-dotted line. This region lies deep inside the superconducting state and is probably due to the matching effect. For comparison, we include the data for H_{c2} (green stars) and for a crossover from vortex liquid to vortex glass phase (violet solid line), both estimated from the magnetization measurements.[14] The upper critical field is in a good agreement with our data. The liquid-glass crossover line, on the other hand, does not extrapolate to the line of the strong pinning found in our measurements (although there is no overlapping temperature interval). This indicates that the maximum theoretical critical current line is not an extension of the irreversibility line and represents a different crossover in the pinning mechanism reflected in the nonmonotonic change in the shape of the pinning potential.

## IV Summary

Temperature- and magnetic-field-dependent penetration depth was measured in single crystals of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} superconductor by using a tunnel diode resonator technique. For H=0, the London penetration depth saturates at low temperatures indicating a fully gapped superconductivity in SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}. The calculated superfluid density is best described by a single-gap s-wave superconductor, perhaps slightly on the stronger coupling side. The H_{c2}(T) was measured down to 0.02T_{c} and could be well described by the HW theory with H_{c2}(0)=0.4817 T and is clearly limited by the orbital depairing. In the magnetic fields between 0.2 and 0.6 T, another diamagnetic phase different from bulk superconductivity is clearly seen, and this phase line is consistent with the surface superconductivity bound by the third critical field, H_{c3}=1.695H_{c2}. The Campbell penetration depth and the theoretical critical current density both exhibit nonmonotonic behavior with the strongest pinning at intermediate temperatures. We assign maximum pinning to matching effects between the temperature-dependent coherence length and the relevant pinning landscape length scale.
