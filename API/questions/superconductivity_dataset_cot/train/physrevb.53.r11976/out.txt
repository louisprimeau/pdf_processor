###### Abstract

Measurements of the temperature dependencies of the thermopower \alpha(T) and the resistivity \rho(T) of polycrystalline YBa2Cu3O696 and YBa2Cu4O8 under different hydrostatic pressures are reported. They are interpreted to reveal an increase with pressure in the superconductive-condensate density n_{s} of the chains. A literature report of dT_{c}/dP=0.25 K/bax for optimally doped Y3O5Ca30.Ba2Cu4O8 is argued to be due to an increase in the elastic coupling between the CuO2 sheets of the double Cu-O chains as a result of the increase in chain n_{s}. A c-axis in-phase A_{g} vibration of the oxygen atoms of the CuO2 sheets is identified as a participant in the underlying physical mechanism responsible not only for high-T_{c} superconductivity, but also for the pressure dependencies of T_{c} and \alpha(T). [S0163-1829(96)51518-3]

The anisotropic conductivity of the fully oxidized copper oxide superconductors YBa2Cu3O7-\delta (Y-123) (Refs. 1 and 2) and naturally stoichiometric YBa2Cu4O8 (Y-124) (Ref. 3) have demonstrated that the Cu-O _chains_ running parallel to the orthorhombic b axis are metallic conductors having a normal-state conductivity competitive with the metallic conductivity of the CuO2 _sheets_. These observations have stimulated considerable interest in the role of the chains in these materials not only as charge reservoirs for the CuO2 sheets, but also as structural components exhibiting a superconductivity induced by proximity to the superconductive sheets. Optimal spectroscopy on single crystals [4] and muon-spin relaxation (\muSR) studies on polycrystals [5] have provided convincing evidence for involvement of the charge carriers of the chains in superconductive condensation. The \muSR data provide a measure of the ratio of the superconductive-condensate density to the charge-carrier effective mass n_{s}/m* through the muon-spin depolarization rate \sigma, which is proportional to the inverse square of the London penetration depth \lambda^{-2}= \mu_{0}e^{2}n_{s}/m*. Uemura _et al._[6] showed that the superconductive critical temperature T_{c} associated with underdoped superconductive CuO2 sheets follows a universal linear increase with the low-temperature depolarization rate \sigma(0). Tallon _et al._[5] showed that this linear relationship does not hold where the chains are also superconductive. The depolarization rate \sigma(0) is proportional to the sum of the sheet and chain contributions (n_{s}/m*)a+ (n_{s}/m*)_{\rm ch}.

The chain contribution to the temperature-dependent thermopower \alpha(T) is negative and competitive over all temperatures T_{c}<T<300 K with the positive contribution from the sheets in fully oxidized YBa2Cu3O7-\delta; moreover, the chain contribution exhibits the same anomalous low-temperature enhancement of the magnitude of the thermopower that is found to be a peculiar characteristic of the normal state of the superconductive CuO2 sheets. [7] This enhancement has a maximum at T_{\rm max}\sim140 K, which is too high to be associated with acoustic phonons; we have suggested it is associated with _vibronic_ coupling to an optical-mode site deformation [8] and hence that elastic coupling between the sheets and the chains may be responsible for inducing superconductivity in the chains. We have also established a relationship between dT_{c}/dP and d\,\alpha(T)/dP in the system La2-_{x}Sr_{x}CuO4, which contains only CuO2 sheets. [9] In this paper we report on the pressure dependence of both \alpha(T) and the temperature-dependent resistivity \rho(T) for fully oxidized YBa2Cu3O7-\delta and YBa2Cu4O8. These measurements (a) answer to what extent pressure-induced charge transfer between Cu-O chains and CuO2 sheets influences T_{c} in these compounds, (b) reveal an important enhancement with pressure of the superconductive-condensate density n_{s} of the chains, and (c) address the identification of an underlying physical mechanism that relates dT_{c}/dP to changes with pressure of the normal-state properties.

Polycrystalline samples of Y-124 and Y-123, which were single phase to x-ray powder diffraction after slow cooling in oxygen, were cut into a rectangular shape and loaded into a self-clamped pressure cell that will be described elsewhere. The cooling rate during measurement was well-controlled to around 0.2 K/min. The pressures inside the chamber were monitored with manganin wire over the whole temperature range for each run, which allowed correction to be made to a constant pressure in the cell for all temperatures. However, we plot raw data and show, for one pressure for each compound, how the data would be modified by such a correction. The Montgomery four-probe method was used to measure resistivity. The setup for thermopower measurements under pressure was thoroughly tested; it gives the correct thermopower of Cu and Pt metal. The data are highly reproducible. The contribution from the copper leads was subtracted from all our thermopower data. The subtraction was made possible by measurement of the thermopower below T_{c}=124 K of the Tl-2223 superconductor, which not only gave the copper-lead contribution at ambient pressure but also showed it to be essentially pressure independent. The temperature dependence of the copper-lead contribution above T_{c} was obtained from the literature. The systematic error to the true value of thermopower is within \pm0.4 \muV/K in our setup. The data obtained before the application of pressure were the same as those obtained after the pressure was released, which indicates that no chemical change occurred under high pressure.

Figures 1 and 2 display the \rho(T) and \alpha(T) data for several hydrostatic pressures for the fully oxidized Y-123 com pound (\delta\approx0.04). The temperature at which \rho(T) vanishes is T_{0}, and a dT_{0}/dP=-0.027 K/kbar for this slightly overdoped superconductor is consistent with data reported in the literature.[10] At atmospheric pressure, the \alpha(T) curve in Fig. 2 is also the same as previously reported; the negative value of \alpha(T) reflects a dominance of the chain contribution.[7] Hydrostatic pressure increases the magnitude of both the negative thermopower and the negative enhancement hump.

Figures 3 and 4 show \rho(T) and \alpha(T) data for several hydrostatic pressures for the underdoped Y-124 sample. The measured dT_{0}/dP=0.66 K/kbar is consistent with that reported by other workers.[11, 12, 13] We take the pressure in the calculation of dT_{0}/dP at T_{0}, which gives a slightly higher value of dT_{0}/dP than in the previously reported data. For this compound, \alpha(T) is positive as in the copper oxide superconductors where the thermopower is associated with the CuO_{2} sheets. However, its temperature dependence does not exhibit the positive enhancement found for the CuO_{2} sheets; rather it shows a temperature dependence to be expected where there is an important negative contribution from the chains as in Fig. 2. As for Y-123 of Fig. 2, pressure decreases \alpha(T), presumably by increasing the negative compo

  nent in \alpha(T) relative to the positive component. The line shown in Fig. 4 corresponds to the curve for 15 kbar at room temperature corrected to a uniform pressure for all temperatures; it shows a minimum near 140 K, the temperature where the magnitude of \alpha(T) has its maximum enhancement in other copper oxide superconductors.

The small value of dT_{0}/dP\!=\!-0.027 K/kbar in Fig. 1 shows that pressure induces little, if any, electron transfer from the CuO_{2} sheets to the Cu-O chains in slightly overdoped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} with \delta\approx0.04, which is in marked contrast to the underdoped composition; for \delta\approx0.3, a dT_{0}/dP\!=\!1.0 K/kbar was found.[9] It follows that, for \delta\approx0.04, the pressure dependence of the thermopower reflects changes occurring in the sheets and the chains at essentially fixed charge-carrier concentrations in each. Measurements of the pressure dependence of \alpha(T) in the system La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} have shown[9] that the overdoped x=0.22 composition exhibits no pressure dependence of either T_{c} or the thermopower of the CuO_{2} sheets. The absence of any significant pressure dependence of T_{0} in overdoped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} with \delta\approx0.04 is therefore consistent with an absence of charge transfer from or to the CuO_{2} sheets and a T_{c} determined by the hole concentration in the CuO_{2} sheets, as implied by the \muSR data of Tallon _et al.[5]_ Therefore little, if any, pressure dependence of the thermopower from the CuO_{2} sheets should be present as in overdoped La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}. It follows that the changes in \alpha(T) with pressure shown in Fig. 2 reflect primarily changes in the chain contribution to \alpha(T), which is negative. We have pointed out elsewhere[14] that the thermopower imparted by a partially filled band is a measure of the curvature of the \varepsilon({\bf k}) dispersion curve at the Fermi energy \varepsilon_{F}. The increase in the magnitude of the negative \alpha(T) with pressure shown in Fig. 2 indicates an increase in the curvature of the chain \varepsilon({\bf k}) at \varepsilon_{F}. A flattening of the \varepsilon({\bf k}) curve, i.e., a higher degeneracy at \varepsilon_{F}, allows stabilization of a greater superconductive-condensate density in the chains. The \muSR data of Tallon _et al.[5]_ have shown that an increase in the chain n_{s} does not change T_{c} in the overdoped compositional range, so our deduction of an increase in the chain n_{s} is consistent with a dT_{0}/dP\!\approx\!-0.027 K/kbar.

The temperature dependence of the thermopower \alpha(T) shown in Fig. 4 agrees, at ambient pressure, with that reported by Tallon _et al.[15]_ it differs from that found for other underdoped cuprate superconductors. Underdoped CuO_{2} sheets should exhibit a maximum positive enhancement at T_{\rm max}\approx140 K whereas Fig. 4 shows a minimum in \alpha(T) near 140 K as does \alpha(T) in Fig. 2. We conclude that the fully oxidized double chains of the Y-124 oxides make a negative contribution to the thermopower that is in opposition to a relatively large, positive thermopower from underdoped CuO_{2} sheets and that, as in fully oxidized Y-123, an enhancement of the magnitude of the negative contribution is responsible for the minimum in \alpha(T) at almost 140 K even though the negative contribution remains smaller than the positive contribution. Indeed, the minimum in \alpha(T) near 140 K is deepened with pressure. The existence of a chain enhancement factor in the normal state with a T_{\rm max}\approx140 K signals, according to other \alpha(T) data on the copper oxide superconductors, condensation in the double chains below T_{c} of superconductive pairs. This deduction finds independent confirmation in the \muSR data of Tallon _et al.[5]_, which show a deviation from the universal T_{c} versus \sigma(0) of Uemura _et al.[6]_ because of a contribution from (n_{s}/m^{*})_{\rm ch}.

In order to account for a negative contribution to the thermopower from the double chains, we note that the lower y^{2}-z^{2} Hubbard band of the chains is split in two by the translational symmetry since the double chains have two distinguishable Cu(1) atoms. Underdoped CuO_{2} sheets would have around p\!\approx0.125 holes per Cu(2) atom in the lower x^{2}-y^{2} Hubbard band of the CuO_{2} sheets. A formula YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} then gives 0.625 electrons per Cu(1) atom in the lower Hubbard y^{2}-z^{2} band of the double chains; and a splitting of this y^{2}-z^{2} band in two by the translational symmetry leaves the partially occupied band one-quarter filled, which accounts for a negative chain contribution to the thermopower.

The large dT_{0}/dP\!=\!0.66 K/kbar observed for Y-124 has been interpreted[11, 13] to be caused by electron transfer from the CuO_{2} sheets to the double chains in this underdoped material, and indeed a large electron transfer from the sheets to the chains has been confirmed for underdoped Y-123.[9] On the other hand, the optimally doped x=0.1 composition of the system Y_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} retains a large dT_{0}/dP\!=\!0.25 K/kbar.[16] (T_{c} increases from 82 K at x\!=\!0 to 90 K at x\!=\!0.1 in this system.) At optimal doping, transfer of electrons either from or to the CuO_{2} sheets can only reduce T_{c}, so the large dT_{0}/dP\!=\!0.25 K/kbar can only be due to some other factors. In optimally doped La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4}, a dT_{0}/dP\!=\!0.1 K/kbar is due to a straightening of the Cu-O-Cu bond angle in the CuO_{2} sheets,[17] but this mechanism is apparently not operative in slightly overdoped Y-123, Fig. 1. We proposed here an alternate mechanism for dT_{c}/dP\!>\!0: the increase with pressure in superconductive-condensate density n_{s} in the double chains, which we deduced above, is caused by the enhancement of the elastic coupling between the CuO_{2} sheets and the double chains along the c axis. An increase in the amplitude of the oxygen

  displacements of a vibronic coupling, through cooperative elastic interactions between the chains and sheets, increases T_{c} for the CuO_{2} sheets.

Indirect support for this proposal comes from the observation [18] that all the Raman modes for Y-124 increase linearly with pressure except the in-phase O(2)-O(3) A_{g} vibration of the oxygen atoms of a CuO_{2} sheet along the c axis--see arrows in Fig. 5(b), which saturates above 60 kbar. At the same pressure, T_{c} versus pressure saturates also. [11] Therefore, we tentatively associate this optical-mode oxygen motion with the formation of superconductive pairs. Moreover, a phonon-drag gives a low-temperature thermopower enhancement of \alpha(T) due to acoustic phonons that has a T_{\rm max}\approx0.2-0.3\theta_{D}, where \theta_{D} is the Debye temperature. [14] The O(2)-O(3) A_{g} in-phase optical mode has a characteristic temperature of 672 K; and 20% of this temperature would give a T_{\rm max}\approx134 K, which is close to the T_{\rm max}\approx140 K for the enhancement term found for the normal state of the copper oxides that become superconductive. Pressure increases the enhancement maximum as well as T_{c}, which is a further indication that the two are related to a common underlying physical mechanism such as the optical-mode oxygen vibration that we have identified.

In conclusion, measurement of \alpha(T) and \rho(T) under pressure have shown that (a) pressure induces little electron transfer between the sheets and the chains in nearly optimally doped Y-123 and that the electron transfer from sheets to chains in underdoped Y-124 cannot alone account for the magnitude of dT_{0}/dP = 0.66 K/kbar, (b) pressure increases significantly the superconductive-condensate density n_{s} of the chains in both Y-123 and Y-124 fully oxidized samples in a manner that is consistent with published \muSR data, (c) our results establish a relation between the enhancement factor in \alpha(T) and the superconductive condensate density n_{s}, and (d) a common underlying physical mechanism underlies T_{c} and both the nearly temperature-independent term \alpha_{0} and the enhancement term \delta\alpha(T) of the thermopower \alpha(T) = \alpha_{0}+\delta\alpha(T). We tentatively identify this mechanism as an optical-mode oxygen vibration that couples vibronically to the electrons of a CuO_{2} sheet and elastically along the c axis to the Cu-O chains of the Y-123 and Y-124 structures to induce a parasitic superconductivity in the chains.

Recently, several reports have appeared regarding superconductive condensation in the chains of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Refs. [19] and [20]) and interplane coupling in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{3}O_{15}. [21]

The small value of dT_{0}/dP\!=\!-0.027 K/kbar in Fig. 1 shows that pressure induces little, if any, electron transfer from the CuO_{2} sheets to the Cu-O chains in slightly overdoped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} with \delta\approx0.04, which is in marked contrast to the underdoped composition; for \delta\approx0.3, a dT_{0}/dP\!=\!1.0 K/kbar was found.[9] It follows that, for \delta\approx0.04, the pressure dependence of the thermopower reflects changes occurring in the sheets and the chains at essentially fixed charge-carrier concentrations in each. Measurements of the pressure dependence of \alpha(T) in the system La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} have shown[9] that the overdoped x=0.22 composition exhibits no pressure dependence of either T_{c} or the thermopower of the CuO_{2} sheets.

The increase in the magnitude of the negative \alpha(T) with pressure shown in Fig. 2 indicates an increase in the curvature of the chain \varepsilon({\bf k}) at \varepsilon_{F}. A flattening of the \varepsilon({\bf k}) curve, i.e., a higher degeneracy at \varepsilon_{F}, allows stabilization of a greater superconductive-condensate density in the chains. The \muSR data of Tallon _et al.[5]_ have shown that an increase in the chain n_{s} does not change T_{c} in the overdoped compositional range, so our deduction of an increase in the chain n_{s} is consistent with a dT_{0}/dP\!\approx\!-0.027 K/kbar.

The temperature dependence of the thermopower \alpha(T) shown in Fig. 4 agrees, at ambient pressure, with that reported by Tallon _et al.[15]_ it differs from that found for other underdoped cuprate superconductors. Underdoped CuO_{2} sheets should exhibit a maximum positive enhancement at T_{\rm max}\approx140 K whereas Fig. 4 shows a minimum in \alpha(T) near 140 K as does \alpha(T) in Fig. 2. We conclude that the fully oxidized double chains of the Y-124 oxides make a negative contribution to the thermopower that is in opposition to a relatively large, positive thermopower from underdoped CuO_{2} sheets and that, as in fully oxidized Y-123, an enhancement of the magnitude of the negative contribution is responsible for the minimum in \alpha(T) at almost 140 K even though the negative contribution remains smaller than the positive contribution. Indeed, the minimum in \alpha(T) near 140 K is deepened with pressure. The existence of a chain enhancement factor in the normal state with a T_{\rm max}\approx140 K signals, according to other \alpha(T) data on the copper oxide superconductors, condensation in the double chains below T_{c} of superconductive pairs. This deduction finds independent confirmation in the \muSR data of Tallon _et al.[5]_, which show a deviation from the universal T_{c} versus \sigma(0) of Uemura _et al.[6]_ because of a contribution from (n_{s}/m^{*})_{\rm ch}.

In order to account for a negative contribution to the thermopower from the double chains, we note that the lower y^{2}-z^{2} Hubbard band of the chains is split in two by the translational symmetry since the double chains have two distinguishable Cu(1) atoms. Underdoped CuO_{2} sheets would have around p\!\approx0.125 holes per Cu(2) atom in the lower x^{2}-y^{2} Hubbard band of the CuO_{2} sheets. A formula YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} then gives 0.625 electrons per Cu(1) atom in the lower Hubbard y^{2}-z^{2} band of the double chains; and a splitting of this y^{2}-z^{2} band in two by the translational symmetry leaves the partially occupied band one-quarter filled, which accounts for a negative chain contribution to the thermopower.

The large dT_{0}/dP\!=\!0.66 K/kbar observed for Y-124 has been interpreted[11, 13] to be caused by electron transfer from the CuO_{2} sheets to the double chains in this underdoped material, and indeed a large electron transfer from the sheets to the chains has been confirmed for underdoped Y-123.[9] On the other hand, the optimally doped x=0.1 composition of the system Y_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} retains a large dT_{0}/dP\!=\!0.25 K/kbar.[16] (T_{c} increases from 82 K at x\!=\!0 to 90 K at x\!=\!0.1 in this system.) At optimal doping, transfer of electrons either from or to the CuO_{2} sheets can only reduce T_{c}, so the large dT_{0}/dP\!=\!0.25 K/kbar can only be due to some other factors. In optimally doped La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4}, a dT_{0}/dP\!=\!0.1 K/kbar is due to a straightening of the Cu-O-Cu bond angle in the CuO_{2} sheets,[17] but this mechanism is apparently not operative in slightly overdoped Y-123, Fig. 1. We proposed here an alternate mechanism for dT_{c}/dP\!>\!0: the increase with pressure in superconductive-condensate density n_{s} in the double chains, which we deduced above, is caused by the enhancement of the elastic coupling between the CuO_{2} sheets and the double chains along the c axis. An increase in the amplitude of the oxygen

  displacements of a vibronic coupling, through cooperative elastic interactions between the chains and sheets, increases T_{c} for the CuO_{2} sheets.

Indirect support for this proposal comes from the observation [18] that all the Raman modes for Y-124 increase linearly with pressure except the in-phase O(2)-O(3) A_{g} vibration of the oxygen atoms of a CuO_{2} sheet along the c axis--see arrows in Fig. 5(b), which saturates above 60 kbar. At the same pressure, T_{c} versus pressure saturates also. [11] Therefore, we tentatively associate this optical-mode oxygen motion with the formation of superconductive pairs. Moreover, a phonon-drag gives a low-temperature thermopower enhancement of \alpha(T) due to acoustic phonons that has a T_{\rm max}\approx0.2-0.3\theta_{D}, where \theta_{D} is the Debye temperature. [14] The O(2)-O(3) A_{g} in-phase optical mode has a characteristic temperature of 672 K; and 20% of this temperature would give a T_{\rm max}\approx134 K, which is close to the T_{\rm max}\approx140 K for the enhancement term found for the normal state of the copper oxides that become superconductive. Pressure increases the enhancement maximum as well as T_{c}, which is a further indication that the two are related to a common underlying physical mechanism such as the optical-mode oxygen vibration that we have identified.

In conclusion, measurement of \alpha(T) and \rho(T) under pressure have shown that (a) pressure induces little electron transfer between the sheets and the chains in nearly optimally doped Y-123 and that the electron transfer from sheets to chains in underdoped Y-124 cannot alone account for the magnitude of dT_{0}/dP = 0.66 K/kbar, (b) pressure increases significantly the superconductive-condensate density n_{s} of the chains in both Y-123 and Y-124 fully oxidized samples in a manner that is consistent with published \muSR data, (c) our results establish a relation between the enhancement factor in \alpha(T) and the superconductive condensate density n_{s}, and (d) a common underlying physical mechanism underlies T_{c} and both the nearly temperature-independent term \alpha_{0} and the enhancement term \delta\alpha(T) of the thermopower \alpha(T) = \alpha_{0}+\delta\alpha(T). We tentatively identify this mechanism as an optical-mode oxygen vibration that couples vibronically to the electrons of a CuO_{2} sheet and elastically along the c axis to the Cu-O chains of the Y-123 and Y-124 structures to induce a parasitic superconductivity in the chains.

Recently, several reports have appeared regarding superconductive condensation in the chains of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Refs. [19] and [20]) and interplane coupling in Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{3}O_{15}. [21]
