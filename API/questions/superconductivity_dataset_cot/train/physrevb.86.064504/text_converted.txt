###### Abstract

We report resistivity ρ and thermal conductivity κ measurements on
Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃ single crystals, in which superconductivity with T_(c) ≈ 7 K
was claimed to coexist with ferromagnetic spin fluctuations. Among three
crystals, only one crystal shows a small hump in resistivity near 20 K,
which was previously attributed to the ferromagnetic spin fluctuations.
The other two crystals show the ρ ∼ T² Fermi-liquid behavior at low
temperature. For both single crystals with and without the resistivity
anomaly, the residual linear term κ₀/T is negligible in zero magnetic
field. In low fields, κ₀(H)/T shows a slow field dependence. These
results demonstrate that the superconducting gap of Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃ is
nodeless and thus rule out a nodal gap caused by ferromagnetic spin
fluctuations.

## I Introduction

The interplay between magnetism and superconductivity has been a central
issue in unconventional superconductors. While the static magnetism is
generally believed to compete with superconductivity, the dynamic
magnetism could be the source of electron pairing. [1] For example, the
antiferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuations are considered the pairing glue
in high-T_(c) cuprates, iron-based superconductors, and many
heavy-fermion superconductors. [1] However, the ferromagnetic (FM) spin
fluctuations could be the origin of the superconductivity in Sr₂RuO₄,
and in the heavy-fermion superconductors UGe₂ and URhGe. [1] These AF
and FM spin fluctuations usually result in superconducting gaps with
nodes, such as the d-wave gap in cuprates and CeCoIn₅, [2, 3] and the
p-wave gap in Sr₂RuO₄, [4] but in some cases, such as in multiband
iron-based superconductors, the AF spin fluctuations may give an
s_(±)-wave gap without nodes. [5]

Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃ is a cubic transition-metal compound in which
superconductivity with T_(c) ≈ 7 K was found 30 years ago. [6] Very few
studies have been done on this compound since its discovery. Until
recently, detailed resistivity, susceptibility, and specific heat
measurements suggested that the superconductivity coexists with FM spin
fluctuations in Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃. [7] A peaklike anomaly near 30 K in
resistivity was observed. Below the anomaly, the non-Fermi-liquid
behavior of resistivity in zero field has been attributed to the FM spin
fluctuations, and, upon applying magnetic field, Fermi liquid behavior
is recovered. [7]

Since the FM spin fluctuations may cause a nodal superconducting state
in Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃, it is interesting to probe its superconducting gap
structure. Ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity measurement is such
a bulk technique. [8] The existence of a finite residual linear term
κ₀/T in zero magnetic field is evidence for gap nodes. The field
dependence of κ₀/T may further give support for a nodal superconducting
state and provide information on the gap anisotropy, or multiple gaps.
[9]

In this paper, we measure the resistivity and thermal conductivity of
Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃ single crystals. We find that while one crystal shows a small
hump in resistivity near 20 K, the other two crystals show ρ ∼ T²
Fermi-liquid behavior in zero field. For both single crystals with and
without the resistivity anomaly, the absence of κ₀/T in zero field and
the slow field dependence of κ₀(H)/T in low fields clearly demonstrate
nodeless superconductivity in Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃.

## II Experiment

Single crystals of Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃ were grown by the flux method, as
previously described in Ref. [6]. The excessive Sn flux was etched in
concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl). The obtained single crystals have
typical size of a few cubic millimeters. We chose three single crystals
with a large flat surface, which was identified as the (110) plane by
x-ray diffraction measurements. Then the single crystals were polished
and cut to a rectangular shape of typical dimensions 2.5 × 1.0 mm² in
the (110) plane, and 0.2 mm in thickness. The dc magnetic susceptibility
was measured at H = 20 Oe both parallel and perpendicular to the (110)
plane, using a superconducting quantum interference device (MPMS,
Quantum Design). Four silver wires were attached to the sample with
silver paint, which were used for both resistivity and thermal
conductivity measurements, with electrical and heat currents in the
(110) plane. The contacts are metallic with typical resistance 50 mΩ at
2 K. The thermal conductivity was measured in a dilution refrigerator,
using a standard four-wire steady-state method with two RuO₂ chip
thermometers, calibrated _in situ_ against a reference RuO₂ thermometer.
Magnetic fields were applied perpendicular to the (110) plane. To ensure
a homogeneous field distribution in the sample, all fields were applied
at temperatures above T_(c).

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1(a) presents the typical dc magnetic susceptibility of
Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃ single crystals, measured in H = 20 Oe parallel and
perpendicular to the (110) plane, with zero field cooled. The transition
temperature T_(c) ≈ 6.9 K is determined from the onset of diamagnetic
transition. In the field perpendicular to the (110) plane, the shielding
volume fractions exceed −1 at 2 K, indicating bulk superconductivity of
the sample. Figure 1(b) plots the resistivities of samples S1, S2, and
S3 in zero magnetic field. For all three samples, the zero resistivity
T_(c) ≈ 7.25 K is slightly higher than that obtained from the

magnetization measurements in Fig. 1(a), and the 10-90

From Fig. 1(b), only the resistivity of S1 shows an anomaly at low
temperature, while S2 and S3 show good metallic behavior. Figure 1(c)
plots the resistivity data below 50 K. All data sets are offset for
clarity. One can see that the small hump near 20 K of S1 is much less
pronounced than the peak near 30 K in Ref. 7. Interestingly, for S2 and
S3, the low-temperature data obey the Fermi-liquid behavior ρ ∼ T², as
indicated by the solid lines. We note that the residual resistivity ρ₀
of S1 is the highest among all three samples. If lower ρ₀ indicates
higher sample quality, the resistivity anomaly may be not an intrinsic
property of Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃. However, we are not sure about this at the
current stage.

Nevertheless, it is necessary to check the superconducting gap structure
of both Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃ samples with and without the resistivity anomaly. The
upper critical field H_(c2) needs to be determined first. Figure 2(a)
shows the resistivity of the Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃ single crystal S1 in a magnetic
field up to H = 7 T. For H = 7 T, no superconducting transition is
observed down to 2 K. The normal-state ρ(7 T) curve is quite flat,
extrapolating to a residual resistivity ρ₀(7 T) = 114.0 μΩ cm. In Fig.
2(b), we plot the temperature dependence of the upper critical field
H_(c2), defined by ρ = 0 from the curves in Fig. 2(a). A rough
estimation gives H_(c2)(0) ≈ 7 T. Similar measurements on S2 give the
same H_(c2)(0), and ρ₀(7 T) = 79.6 μΩ cm.

Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity
for samples S1 and S2 in zero magnetic fields, plotted as κ/T vs T. The
measured thermal conductivity is the sum of two contributions, from
electrons and phonons, respectively, so that κ = κ_(e) + κ_(p). In order
to obtain the residual linear term κ₀/T contributed by electrons, we
extrapolate κ/T to T = 0. Usually, this can be done by fitting the data
to

quite flat, extrapolating to residual resistivity ρ₀(7 T) ≈ 114 μΩ cm.

temperature, as indicated by the solid lines.

κ/T = a + bT^(α − 1) at low temperature, where a ≡ κ₀/T.[10; 11] The
power α of the second term contributed by phonons is typically between 2
and 3, due to specular reflections of phonons at the boundary.[10; 11]
From Fig. 3(a), the curves below 250 mK can be well fitted by
κ/T = a + bT^(α − 1) with α = 2.41 and 2.27 for S1 and S2, respectively.
Previously α ≈ 2.2 has been observed in the s-wave superconductor
Cu_(0.06)TiSe₂,[12] and recently α ≈ 2 was found in some iron-based
superconductors such as BaFe_(1.9)Ni_(0.1)As₂ and KFe₂As₂.[13; 14] Below
we only focus on κ₀/T.

In zero field, the fittings give κ₀/T = −3 ± 3 and 8 ± 5μW K⁻² cm⁻¹ for
S1 and S2, respectively. Note that our experimental error bar is about 5
μW K⁻² cm⁻¹. For s-wave nodeless superconductors, there are no fermionic
quasiparticles to conduct heat as T → 0, since all electrons become
Cooper pairs. Therefore, there is no residual linear term of κ₀/T, as
seen in V₃Si.[10] However, for unconventional superconductors with nodes
in the superconducting gap, the nodal quasiparticles will contribute a
finite κ₀/T in zero field.[8] For example, κ₀/T = 1.41 mW K⁻² cm⁻¹ for
the overdoped cuprate Tl₂Ba₂CuO_(6 + δ) (Tl-2201), a d-wave
superconductor with T_(c) = 15 K.[15] For the p-wave superconductor
Sr₂RuO₄, κ₀/T = 17 mW K⁻² cm⁻¹.[16] Therefore, the negligible κ₀/T of
both S1 and S2 samples strongly suggests that the superconducting gap of
Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃ is nodeless.

Figure 3(b) plots the thermal conductivity of S1 in magnetic fields. All
the curves are also fitted by κ/T = a + bT^(α − 1). In H_(c2) = 7 T,
κ₀/T = 0.216 ± 0.003 mW K⁻² cm⁻¹ was obtained from the fitting. This
value meets the Wiedemann-Franz law expectation L₀/ρ₀(7 T) = 0.215 mW
K⁻² cm⁻¹ nicely, with L₀ the Lorenz number 2.45 × 10⁻⁸ W Ω K⁻² and ρ₀(7
T) = 114.0 μΩ cm. The verification of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the
normal state shows the reliability of our thermal conductivity
measurements.

As seen in Fig. 3(b), κ₀/T of S1 gradually increases with increasing
field. In Fig. 4, we plot the normalized κ₀(H)/T as a function of
H/H_(c2) for S1. The κ₀/T of S2 shows similar field dependence, which is
not shown here. For comparison, the data of the clean s-wave
superconductor Nb,[17] the dirty s-wave superconducting alloy InBi,[18]
the multiband s-wave superconductor NbSe₂,[19] and an overdoped sample
of the d-wave superconductor Tl-2201[15] are also plotted. For a clean
type II s-wave superconductor with a single gap, κ should grow
exponentially with field (above H_(c1)), as is indeed observed in
Nb.[17] For InBi, the curve is exponential at low H, crossing over to a
roughly linear behavior closer to H_(c2) as expected for s-wave
superconductors in the dirty limit.[20]

The normalized κ₀(H)/T of Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃ clearly mimics that of the dirty
s-wave superconductor InBi. However, previously Yang _et al._ estimated
the superconducting coherence length ξ₀ ∼ 79 A and the electronic mean
free path l ∼ 811 A, which implies that Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃ is an intrinsic
clean-limit superconductor (ξ₀ ≪ l).[7] Since the ρ₀ of our sample S1 is
about twice that of Yang _et al._, we estimate the mean free path
l ∼ 400 A for S1. The H_(c2)(0) of S1 is the same as in Ref. [7], which
gives the same ξ₀ ∼ 79 A through the relation H_(c2)(0) = Φ₀/2πξ₀.
Therefore, sample S1 is still a clean superconductor, and the relatively
fast increase of κ₀(H)/T

data are shown for the clean s-wave superconductor Nb,[17] the dirty
s-wave superconducting alloy InBi,[18] the multiband s-wave
superconductor NbSe₂,[19] and an overdoped sample of the d-wave
superconductor Tl-2201.[15]

near H_(c2) should have a different origin from the dirty s-wave
superconductor InBi.

Band structure calculation shows that there are six bands in Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃
which cross the Fermi level.[21] Each sheet of the Fermi surface was
found to be three-dimensional, with rather complex shape.[21] In this
context, we interpret that the κ₀(H)/T behavior of Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃ may result
from multiple gaps or gap anisotropy.

For the multiband s-wave superconductor NbSe₂, κ₀(H)/T increases rapidly
in both low field and near H_(c2).[19] Similar behavior has been
observed in LNi₂B₂C (L = Y, Lu) with multiple and anisotropic gaps.[22,
23] In both NbSe₂ and LNi₂B₂C, applying a field rapidly delocalizes
quasiparticle states confined within the vortices associated with the
smaller gap band, while those states associated with the larger gap band
delocalize more slowly. For NbSe₂, the ratio between larger and smaller
gaps is approximately 3,[24] and for YNi₂B₂C, the ratio is about
2.1.[23] Recently, Bang has calculated the field dependence of κ₀(H)/T
for different gap ratios to explain the thermal conductivity data of the
multigap iron-based superconductor Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂.[25] It is
possible that in Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃ the gaps in the six Fermi surfaces may have
different magnitudes, or in some Fermi surface the gap is anisotropic.
If this is the case, according to Bang’s calculation,[25] the gap ratio
in Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃ should be around 1.4 or so. This interpretation needs to
be checked by momentum-dependent measurements of the superconducting
gap, such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)
experiments.

## IV Summary

In summary, we report the resistivity and thermal conductivity
measurements of Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃ single crystals. Among three crystals, only
one sample shows a resistivity anomaly near 20 K, and the other two
samples display Fermi-liquid behavior ρ ∼ T² at low temperature. This
suggests that the resistivity anomaly may be not intrinsic in
Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃. Thermal conductivity results clearly demonstrate that the
superconducting gap is nodeless in both crystals with and without the
resistivity anomaly. This implies that the FM spin fluctuations, if they
exist, may be irrelevant to the superconductivity in Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃, and the
conventional electron-phonon interaction should be responsible for the
electron pairing. The κ₀(H)/T shows a relatively fast increase near
H_(c2). Since Ca₃Ir₄Sn₁₃ is not in the dirty limit, but rather has
multiple Fermi surfaces with complex shape, we interpret that the
behavior of κ₀(H)/T may result from gap anisotropy, or multiple
isotropic gaps with different magnitudes.
