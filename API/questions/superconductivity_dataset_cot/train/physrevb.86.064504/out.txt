###### Abstract

We report resistivity \rho and thermal conductivity \kappa measurements on Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} single crystals, in which superconductivity with T_{c}\approx 7 K was claimed to coexist with ferromagnetic spin fluctuations. Among three crystals, only one crystal shows a small hump in resistivity near 20 K, which was previously attributed to the ferromagnetic spin fluctuations. The other two crystals show the \rho\sim T^{2} Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperature. For both single crystals with and without the resistivity anomaly, the residual linear term \kappa_{0}/T is negligible in zero magnetic field. In low fields, \kappa_{0}(H)/T shows a slow field dependence. These results demonstrate that the superconducting gap of Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} is nodeless and thus rule out a nodal gap caused by ferromagnetic spin fluctuations.

## I Introduction

The interplay between magnetism and superconductivity has been a central issue in unconventional superconductors. While the static magnetism is generally believed to compete with superconductivity, the dynamic magnetism could be the source of electron pairing. [1] For example, the antiferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuations are considered the pairing glue in high-T_{c} cuprates, iron-based superconductors, and many heavy-fermion superconductors. [1] However, the ferromagnetic (FM) spin fluctuations could be the origin of the superconductivity in Sr_{2}RuO_{4}, and in the heavy-fermion superconductors UGe_{2} and URhGe. [1] These AF and FM spin fluctuations usually result in superconducting gaps with nodes, such as the d-wave gap in cuprates and CeCoIn_{5}, [2, 3] and the p-wave gap in Sr_{2}RuO_{4}, [4] but in some cases, such as in multiband iron-based superconductors, the AF spin fluctuations may give an s_{\pm}-wave gap without nodes. [5]

Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} is a cubic transition-metal compound in which superconductivity with T_{c}\approx 7 K was found 30 years ago. [6] Very few studies have been done on this compound since its discovery. Until recently, detailed resistivity, susceptibility, and specific heat measurements suggested that the superconductivity coexists with FM spin fluctuations in Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13}. [7] A peaklike anomaly near 30 K in resistivity was observed. Below the anomaly, the non-Fermi-liquid behavior of resistivity in zero field has been attributed to the FM spin fluctuations, and, upon applying magnetic field, Fermi liquid behavior is recovered. [7]

Since the FM spin fluctuations may cause a nodal superconducting state in Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13}, it is interesting to probe its superconducting gap structure. Ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity measurement is such a bulk technique. [8] The existence of a finite residual linear term \kappa_{0}/T in zero magnetic field is evidence for gap nodes. The field dependence of \kappa_{0}/T may further give support for a nodal superconducting state and provide information on the gap anisotropy, or multiple gaps. [9]

In this paper, we measure the resistivity and thermal conductivity of Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} single crystals. We find that while one crystal shows a small hump in resistivity near 20 K, the other two crystals show \rho\sim T^{2} Fermi-liquid behavior in zero field. For both single crystals with and without the resistivity anomaly, the absence of \kappa_{0}/T in zero field and the slow field dependence of \kappa_{0}(H)/T in low fields clearly demonstrate nodeless superconductivity in Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13}.

## II Experiment

Single crystals of Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} were grown by the flux method, as previously described in Ref. [6]. The excessive Sn flux was etched in concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl). The obtained single crystals have typical size of a few cubic millimeters. We chose three single crystals with a large flat surface, which was identified as the (110) plane by x-ray diffraction measurements. Then the single crystals were polished and cut to a rectangular shape of typical dimensions 2.5\times 1.0 mm^{2} in the (110) plane, and 0.2 mm in thickness. The dc magnetic susceptibility was measured at H=20 Oe both parallel and perpendicular to the (110) plane, using a superconducting quantum interference device (MPMS, Quantum Design). Four silver wires were attached to the sample with silver paint, which were used for both resistivity and thermal conductivity measurements, with electrical and heat currents in the (110) plane. The contacts are metallic with typical resistance 50 m\Omega at 2 K. The thermal conductivity was measured in a dilution refrigerator, using a standard four-wire steady-state method with two RuO_{2} chip thermometers, calibrated _in situ_ against a reference RuO_{2} thermometer. Magnetic fields were applied perpendicular to the (110) plane. To ensure a homogeneous field distribution in the sample, all fields were applied at temperatures above T_{c}.

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1(a) presents the typical dc magnetic susceptibility of Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} single crystals, measured in H=20 Oe parallel and perpendicular to the (110) plane, with zero field cooled. The transition temperature T_{c}\approx 6.9 K is determined from the onset of diamagnetic transition. In the field perpendicular to the (110) plane, the shielding volume fractions exceed -1 at 2 K, indicating bulk superconductivity of the sample. Figure 1(b) plots the resistivities of samples S1, S2, and S3 in zero magnetic field. For all three samples, the zero resistivity T_{c}\approx 7.25 K is slightly higher than that obtained from the

 magnetization measurements in Fig. 1(a), and the 10-90% resistive transition widths are less than 0.2 K.

From Fig. 1(b), only the resistivity of S1 shows an anomaly at low temperature, while S2 and S3 show good metallic behavior. Figure 1(c) plots the resistivity data below 50 K. All data sets are offset for clarity. One can see that the small hump near 20 K of S1 is much less pronounced than the peak near 30 K in Ref. 7. Interestingly, for S2 and S3, the low-temperature data obey the Fermi-liquid behavior \rho\sim T^{2}, as indicated by the solid lines. We note that the residual resistivity \rho_{0} of S1 is the highest among all three samples. If lower \rho_{0} indicates higher sample quality, the resistivity anomaly may be not an intrinsic property of Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13}. However, we are not sure about this at the current stage.

Nevertheless, it is necessary to check the superconducting gap structure of both Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} samples with and without the resistivity anomaly. The upper critical field H_{c2} needs to be determined first. Figure 2(a) shows the resistivity of the Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} single crystal S1 in a magnetic field up to H=7 T. For H=7 T, no superconducting transition is observed down to 2 K. The normal-state \rho(7 T) curve is quite flat, extrapolating to a residual resistivity \rho_{0}(7 T) = 114.0 \mu\Omega cm. In Fig. 2(b), we plot the temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_{c2}, defined by \rho=0 from the curves in Fig. 2(a). A rough estimation gives H_{c2}(0)\approx 7 T. Similar measurements on S2 give the same H_{c2}(0), and \rho_{0}(7 T) = 79.6 \mu\Omega cm.

Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity for samples S1 and S2 in zero magnetic fields, plotted as \kappa/T vs T. The measured thermal conductivity is the sum of two contributions, from electrons and phonons, respectively, so that \kappa=\kappa_{e}+\kappa_{p}. In order to obtain the residual linear term \kappa_{0}/T contributed by electrons, we extrapolate \kappa/T to T=0. Usually, this can be done by fitting the data to

The normal-state \rho(7 T) curve is quite flat, extrapolating to residual resistivity \rho_{0}(7 T) \approx 114 \mu\Omega cm. (b) Temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_{c2}, defined by \rho=0. The dashed line is a guide to the eye, which points to H_{c2}(0)\approx 7 T.

(b) Resistivity of three samples in zero magnetic field. (c) Low-temperature data of the resistivities in (b). The data sets are offset for clarity. Samples S2 and S3 both show \rho\sim T^{2} Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperature, as indicated by the solid lines.

  \kappa/T=a+bT^{\alpha-1} at low temperature, where a\equiv\kappa_{0}/T.[10; 11] The power \alpha of the second term contributed by phonons is typically between 2 and 3, due to specular reflections of phonons at the boundary.[10; 11] From Fig. 3(a), the curves below 250 mK can be well fitted by \kappa/T=a+bT^{\alpha-1} with \alpha=2.41 and 2.27 for S1 and S2, respectively. Previously \alpha\approx 2.2 has been observed in the s-wave superconductor Cu_{0.06}TiSe_{2},[12] and recently \alpha\approx 2 was found in some iron-based superconductors such as BaFe_{1.9}Ni_{0.1}As_{2} and KFe_{2}As_{2}.[13; 14] Below we only focus on \kappa_{0}/T.

In zero field, the fittings give \kappa_{0}/T=-3\pm 3 and 8\pm 5\muW K^{-2} cm^{-1} for S1 and S2, respectively. Note that our experimental error bar is about 5 \muW K^{-2} cm^{-1}. For s-wave nodeless superconductors, there are no fermionic quasiparticles to conduct heat as T\to 0, since all electrons become Cooper pairs. Therefore, there is no residual linear term of \kappa_{0}/T, as seen in V_{3}Si.[10] However, for unconventional superconductors with nodes in the superconducting gap, the nodal quasiparticles will contribute a finite \kappa_{0}/T in zero field.[8] For example, \kappa_{0}/T=1.41 mW K^{-2} cm^{-1} for the overdoped cuprate Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} (Tl-2201), a d-wave superconductor with T_{c}=15 K.[15] For the p-wave superconductor Sr_{2}RuO_{4}, \kappa_{0}/T=17 mW K^{-2} cm^{-1}.[16] Therefore, the negligible \kappa_{0}/T of both S1 and S2 samples strongly suggests that the superconducting gap of Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} is nodeless.

Figure 3(b) plots the thermal conductivity of S1 in magnetic fields. All the curves are also fitted by \kappa/T=a+bT^{\alpha-1}. In H_{c2}=7 T, \kappa_{0}/T=0.216\pm 0.003 mW K^{-2} cm^{-1} was obtained from the fitting. This value meets the Wiedemann-Franz law expectation L_{0}/\rho_{0}(7 T) = 0.215 mW K^{-2} cm^{-1} nicely, with L_{0} the Lorenz number 2.45 \times 10^{-8} W \Omega K^{-2} and \rho_{0}(7 T) = 114.0 \mu\Omega cm. The verification of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the normal state shows the reliability of our thermal conductivity measurements.

As seen in Fig. 3(b), \kappa_{0}/T of S1 gradually increases with increasing field. In Fig. 4, we plot the normalized \kappa_{0}(H)/T as a function of H/H_{c2} for S1. The \kappa_{0}/T of S2 shows similar field dependence, which is not shown here. For comparison, the data of the clean s-wave superconductor Nb,[17] the dirty s-wave superconducting alloy InBi,[18] the multiband s-wave superconductor NbSe_{2},[19] and an overdoped sample of the d-wave superconductor Tl-2201[15] are also plotted. For a clean type II s-wave superconductor with a single gap, \kappa should grow exponentially with field (above H_{c1}), as is indeed observed in Nb.[17] For InBi, the curve is exponential at low H, crossing over to a roughly linear behavior closer to H_{c2} as expected for s-wave superconductors in the dirty limit.[20]

The normalized \kappa_{0}(H)/T of Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} clearly mimics that of the dirty s-wave superconductor InBi. However, previously Yang _et al._ estimated the superconducting coherence length \xi_{0}\sim 79 A and the electronic mean free path l\sim 811 A, which implies that Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} is an intrinsic clean-limit superconductor (\xi_{0}\ll l).[7] Since the \rho_{0} of our sample S1 is about twice that of Yang _et al._, we estimate the mean free path l\sim 400 A for S1. The H_{c2}(0) of S1 is the same as in Ref. [7], which gives the same \xi_{0}\sim 79 A through the relation H_{c2}(0)=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi_{0}. Therefore, sample S1 is still a clean superconductor, and the relatively fast increase of \kappa_{0}(H)/T

Figure 4: (Color online) Normalized residual linear term \kappa_{0}/T of Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} plotted as a function of H/H_{c2}. For comparison, similar data are shown for the clean s-wave superconductor Nb,[17] the dirty s-wave superconducting alloy InBi,[18] the multiband s-wave superconductor NbSe_{2},[19] and an overdoped sample of the d-wave superconductor Tl-2201.[15]

Figure 3: (Color online) (a) Low-temperature thermal conductivity of Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} single crystals S1 and S2 in zero magnetic field. The solid lines are \kappa/T=a+bT^{\alpha-1} fits below 250 mK, respectively. (b) Thermal conductivity of S1 in magnetic fields. The dashed line is the normal-state Wiedemann-Franz law expectation L_{0}/\rho_{0}(7 T), with L_{0} the Lorenz number 2.45\times 10^{-8} W \Omega K^{-2} and \rho_{0}(7 T) = 114.0 \mu\Omega cm.

  near H_{c2} should have a different origin from the dirty s-wave superconductor InBi.

Band structure calculation shows that there are six bands in Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} which cross the Fermi level.[21] Each sheet of the Fermi surface was found to be three-dimensional, with rather complex shape.[21] In this context, we interpret that the \kappa_{0}(H)/T behavior of Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} may result from multiple gaps or gap anisotropy.

For the multiband s-wave superconductor NbSe_{2}, \kappa_{0}(H)/T increases rapidly in both low field and near H_{c2}.[19] Similar behavior has been observed in LNi_{2}B_{2}C (L = Y, Lu) with multiple and anisotropic gaps.[22, 23] In both NbSe_{2} and LNi_{2}B_{2}C, applying a field rapidly delocalizes quasiparticle states confined within the vortices associated with the smaller gap band, while those states associated with the larger gap band delocalize more slowly. For NbSe_{2}, the ratio between larger and smaller gaps is approximately 3,[24] and for YNi_{2}B_{2}C, the ratio is about 2.1.[23] Recently, Bang has calculated the field dependence of \kappa_{0}(H)/T for different gap ratios to explain the thermal conductivity data of the multigap iron-based superconductor Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2}.[25] It is possible that in Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} the gaps in the six Fermi surfaces may have different magnitudes, or in some Fermi surface the gap is anisotropic. If this is the case, according to Bang's calculation,[25] the gap ratio in Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} should be around 1.4 or so. This interpretation needs to be checked by momentum-dependent measurements of the superconducting gap, such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments.

## IV Summary

In summary, we report the resistivity and thermal conductivity measurements of Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} single crystals. Among three crystals, only one sample shows a resistivity anomaly near 20 K, and the other two samples display Fermi-liquid behavior \rho\sim T^{2} at low temperature. This suggests that the resistivity anomaly may be not intrinsic in Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13}. Thermal conductivity results clearly demonstrate that the superconducting gap is nodeless in both crystals with and without the resistivity anomaly. This implies that the FM spin fluctuations, if they exist, may be irrelevant to the superconductivity in Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13}, and the conventional electron-phonon interaction should be responsible for the electron pairing. The \kappa_{0}(H)/T shows a relatively fast increase near H_{c2}. Since Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} is not in the dirty limit, but rather has multiple Fermi surfaces with complex shape, we interpret that the behavior of \kappa_{0}(H)/T may result from gap anisotropy, or multiple isotropic gaps with different magnitudes.

The upper critical field H_{c2} needs to be determined first. Figure 2(a) shows the resistivity of the Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} single crystal S1 in a magnetic field up to H=7 T. For H=7 T, no superconducting transition is observed down to 2 K. The normal-state \rho(7 T) curve is quite flat, extrapolating to a residual resistivity \rho_{0}(7 T) = 114.0 \mu\Omega cm. In Fig. 2(b), we plot the temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_{c2}, defined by \rho=0 from the curves in Fig. 2(a). A rough estimation gives H_{c2}(0)\approx 7 T. Similar measurements on S2 give the same H_{c2}(0), and \rho_{0}(7 T) = 79.6 \mu\Omega cm.

Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity for samples S1 and S2 in zero magnetic fields, plotted as \kappa/T vs T. The measured thermal conductivity is the sum of two contributions, from electrons and phonons, respectively, so that \kappa=\kappa_{e}+\kappa_{p}. In order to obtain the residual linear term \kappa_{0}/T contributed by electrons, we extrapolate \kappa/T to T=0. Usually, this can be done by fitting the data to

  \kappa/T=a+bT^{\alpha-1} at low temperature, where a\equiv\kappa_{0}/T.[10; 11] The power \alpha of the second term contributed by phonons is typically between 2 and 3, due to specular reflections of phonons at the boundary.[10; 11] From Fig. 3(a), the curves below 250 mK can be well fitted by \kappa/T=a+bT^{\alpha-1} with \alpha=2.41 and 2.27 for S1 and S2, respectively. Previously \alpha\approx 2.2 has been observed in the s-wave superconductor Cu_{0.06}TiSe_{2},[12] and recently \alpha\approx 2 was found in some iron-based superconductors such as BaFe_{1.9}Ni_{0.1}As_{2} and KFe_{2}As_{2}.[13; 14] Below we only focus on \kappa_{0}/T.

In zero field, the fittings give \kappa_{0}/T=-3\pm 3 and 8\pm 5\muW K^{-2} cm^{-1} for S1 and S2, respectively. Note that our experimental error bar is about 5 \muW K^{-2} cm^{-1}. For s-wave nodeless superconductors, there are no fermionic quasiparticles to conduct heat as T\to 0, since all electrons become Cooper pairs. Therefore, there is no residual linear term of \kappa_{0}/T, as seen in V_{3}Si.[10] However, for unconventional superconductors with nodes in the superconducting gap, the nodal quasiparticles will contribute a finite \kappa_{0}/T in zero field.[8] For example, \kappa_{0}/T=1.41 mW K^{-2} cm^{-1} for the overdoped cuprate Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} (Tl-2201), a d-wave superconductor with T_{c}=15 K.[15] For the p-wave superconductor Sr_{2}RuO_{4}, \kappa_{0}/T=17 mW K^{-2} cm^{-1}.[16] Therefore, the negligible \kappa_{0}/T of both S1 and S2 samples strongly suggests that the superconducting gap of Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} is nodeless.

Figure 3(b) plots the thermal conductivity of S1 in magnetic fields. All the curves are also fitted by \kappa/T=a+bT^{\alpha-1}. In H_{c2}=7 T, \kappa_{0}/T=0.216\pm 0.003 mW K^{-2} cm^{-1} was obtained from the fitting. This value meets the Wiedemann-Franz law expectation L_{0}/\rho_{0}(7 T) = 0.215 mW K^{-2} cm^{-1} nicely, with L_{0} the Lorenz number 2.45 \times 10^{-8} W \Omega K^{-2} and \rho_{0}(7 T) = 114.0 \mu\Omega cm. The verification of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the normal state shows the reliability of our thermal conductivity measurements.

As seen in Fig. 3(b), \kappa_{0}/T of S1 gradually increases with increasing field. In Fig. 4, we plot the normalized \kappa_{0}(H)/T as a function of H/H_{c2} for S1. The \kappa_{0}/T of S2 shows similar field dependence, which is not shown here. For comparison, the data of the clean s-wave superconductor Nb,[17] the dirty s-wave superconducting alloy InBi,[18] the multiband s-wave superconductor NbSe_{2},[19] and an overdoped sample of the d-wave superconductor Tl-2201[15] are also plotted. For a clean type II s-wave superconductor with a single gap, \kappa should grow exponentially with field (above H_{c1}), as is indeed observed in Nb.[17] For InBi, the curve is exponential at low H, crossing over to a roughly linear behavior closer to H_{c2} as expected for s-wave superconductors in the dirty limit.[20]

The normalized \kappa_{0}(H)/T of Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} clearly mimics that of the dirty s-wave superconductor InBi. However, previously Yang _et al._ estimated the superconducting coherence length \xi_{0}\sim 79 A and the electronic mean free path l\sim 811 A, which implies that Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} is an intrinsic clean-limit superconductor (\xi_{0}\ll l).[7] Since the \rho_{0} of our sample S1 is about twice that of Yang _et al._, we estimate the mean free path l\sim 400 A for S1. The H_{c2}(0) of S1 is the same as in Ref. [7], which gives the same \xi_{0}\sim 79 A through the relation H_{c2}(0)=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi_{0}. Therefore, sample S1 is still a clean superconductor, and the relatively fast increase of \kappa_{0}(H)/T

For comparison, similar data are shown for the clean s-wave superconductor Nb,[17] the dirty s-wave superconducting alloy InBi,[18] the multiband s-wave superconductor NbSe_{2},[19] and an overdoped sample of the d-wave superconductor Tl-2201.[15]

The dashed line is the normal-state Wiedemann-Franz law expectation L_{0}/\rho_{0}(7 T), with L_{0} the Lorenz number 2.45\times 10^{-8} W \Omega K^{-2} and \rho_{0}(7 T) = 114.0 \mu\Omega cm.

  near H_{c2} should have a different origin from the dirty s-wave superconductor InBi.

Band structure calculation shows that there are six bands in Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} which cross the Fermi level.[21] Each sheet of the Fermi surface was found to be three-dimensional, with rather complex shape.[21] In this context, we interpret that the \kappa_{0}(H)/T behavior of Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} may result from multiple gaps or gap anisotropy.

For the multiband s-wave superconductor NbSe_{2}, \kappa_{0}(H)/T increases rapidly in both low field and near H_{c2}.[19] Similar behavior has been observed in LNi_{2}B_{2}C (L = Y, Lu) with multiple and anisotropic gaps.[22, 23] In both NbSe_{2} and LNi_{2}B_{2}C, applying a field rapidly delocalizes quasiparticle states confined within the vortices associated with the smaller gap band, while those states associated with the larger gap band delocalize more slowly. For NbSe_{2}, the ratio between larger and smaller gaps is approximately 3,[24] and for YNi_{2}B_{2}C, the ratio is about 2.1.[23] Recently, Bang has calculated the field dependence of \kappa_{0}(H)/T for different gap ratios to explain the thermal conductivity data of the multigap iron-based superconductor Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2}.[25] It is possible that in Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} the gaps in the six Fermi surfaces may have different magnitudes, or in some Fermi surface the gap is anisotropic. If this is the case, according to Bang's calculation,[25] the gap ratio in Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} should be around 1.4 or so. This interpretation needs to be checked by momentum-dependent measurements of the superconducting gap, such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments.

## IV Summary

In summary, we report the resistivity and thermal conductivity measurements of Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} single crystals. Among three crystals, only one sample shows a resistivity anomaly near 20 K, and the other two samples display Fermi-liquid behavior \rho\sim T^{2} at low temperature. This suggests that the resistivity anomaly may be not intrinsic in Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13}. Thermal conductivity results clearly demonstrate that the superconducting gap is nodeless in both crystals with and without the resistivity anomaly. This implies that the FM spin fluctuations, if they exist, may be irrelevant to the superconductivity in Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13}, and the conventional electron-phonon interaction should be responsible for the electron pairing. The \kappa_{0}(H)/T shows a relatively fast increase near H_{c2}. Since Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} is not in the dirty limit, but rather has multiple Fermi surfaces with complex shape, we interpret that the behavior of \kappa_{0}(H)/T may result from gap anisotropy, or multiple isotropic gaps with different magnitudes.
