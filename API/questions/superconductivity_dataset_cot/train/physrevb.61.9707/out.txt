###### Abstract

We report Cu-NMR studies of the multilayered high-T_{c} cuprate (Cu_{0.6}C_{0.4})Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4}O_{12+y} (Cu1234) with T_{c} = 117 K. In the normal state, the Knight shift (_K_) and the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T_{1}) of ^{63}Cu give evidence that the inner CuO_{2} planes (IP) are underdoped, whereas the outer ones (OP) are heavily overdoped. In the superconducting (SC) state, both K and 1/T_{1} decrease markedly below T_{c} = 117 K in the IP, whereas in the OP they decrease moderately below T_{c} = 117 K, but markedly below T_{c2} = 60 K. The unusual NMR results in the OP reveal that the SC gap does not fully develop down to T_{c2} = 60 K. From comparison with a conventional _d_-wave model, it is shown that the SC gap in the OP increases linearly below T_{c} and follows the mean-field type of T dependence below T_{c2}. We propose that these dissimilarities are caused by the large difference of doping levels between the IP and the OP. The bulk SC transition at T_{c} = 117 K is considered to be triggered by the underdoped IP in Cu1234.

Copper oxide high-T_{c} superconductors commonly include corner-sharing CuO_{2} planes forming a two-dimensional square lattice. Doping hole carriers into the plane is essential for the occurrence of high-T_{c} superconductivity. Various anomalies of physical properties in the normal state as well as the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} strongly depend on the in-plane carrier content N_{h}.

The carriers are homogeneously doped into the planes in mono- or bilayer high-T_{c} cuprates, since all the planes are crystallographically equivalent. This is not the case, however, in multilayered high-T_{c} cuprates, which include three or more CuO_{2} planes in a unit cell. In these compounds, there exist two inequivalent CuO_{2} planes, that is, the outer CuO_{2} planes (denoted as OP) with a pyramidal (five) oxygen coordination and the inner planes (IP) with a square (four) oxygen coordination. The NMR studies reported thus far on the multilayered cuprates Bi2223,[1] Hg1223,[2] and Hg1234 (Ref. [4]) reveal that the carrier content in the OP [N_{h}(OP)] is slightly larger than N_{h}(IP) in the IP. The difference between N_{h}(IP) and N_{h}(OP) is reported to increase in going from the under- to the optimally doped region; however, T_{c} is uniquely determined.[5]^{,}[6] Therefore, this raises the question of which planes can determine the bulk T_{c} of multilayer cuprates, if the doping levels are significantly different between the IP and the OP. Understanding of this issue will give valuable information for considering the role of interlayer coupling in high-T_{c} superconductivity, as well as provide a basis for investigating the superconducting (SC) characteristics of multilayer cuprates.

In this paper we report Cu-NMR studies in the multilayered high-T_{c} cuprate superconductor, (Cu_{1-x}C_{x})Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4}O_{12+y} (Cu1234) which comprises two IP's and the OP's.[7; 8; 9] From measurement of the Hall coefficient, it was inferred that the formal N_{h} average per one CuO_{2} plane in Cu1234 ranges from 0.35 to 0.60, which is significantly larger than those in other multilayered cuprates reported thus far, e.g., N_{h} \sim 0.21 in Hg1234.[10]

In the normal state, the Knight shift (_K_) and the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T_{1}) of ^{63}Cu have proved that the magnetic properties in the OP (IP) are typical of those in heavily overdoped (underdoped) compounds, indicative of a significant difference between N_{h}(OP) and N_{h}(IP). In the SC state, it has been revealed that the SC gap does not develop simultaneously in the IP and the OP. The SC gap in the IP fully develops below T_{c} , but that in the OP increases linearly down to T_{c2} = 60 K below T_{c} = 117 K. We propose that this dissimilarity is caused by the large difference between N_{h}(IP) and N_{h}(OP). Noting that N_{h}(OP) is compatible with those in the overdoped Tl1212 (T_{c} = 64 K) and Tl2201 (43 K), it is suggested that the inherent transition temperature in the OP is reduced to T_{c2} = 60 K due to its heavily overdoped level, and thus the bulk SC transition at T_{c} = 117 K is triggered by the underdoped IP in Cu1234.

A polycrystalline sample of (Cu_{0.6}C_{0.4})Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4}O_{12+y} was prepared by the high-pressure synthesis technique described elsewhere.[7] The superconducting transition tempera  ture T_{c} was determined as 117 K, below which a diamagnetic signal appears in the ac susceptibility, and N_{h} was estimated to be 0.5-0.6 from Hall coefficient measurements. A powder sample, confirmed to be almost a single phase by x-ray diffraction, was magnetically aligned along the c axis. K and 1/T_{1} of ^{63}Cu were measured in the range T = 4.2-300 K at 174.2 MHz and a magnetic field (H\sim 15.5 T) parallel (H\parallelc) and perpendicular (H\perpc) to the c axis. T_{1} was measured as a single component by the saturation-recovery method at the (1/2\leftrightarrow-1/2) central transition (CT).

The NMR spectrum for H\parallelc is shown in the inset of Fig. 1 where the two peaks corresponding to the IP and the OP are well resolved. The results for NMR intensity, K, and T_{1} reveal that the sharp peak at a higher field arises from the Cu(1) site in the IP, and the broad one at a lower field from the Cu(2) site in the OP. Figure 1 shows the ^{63}Cu-NMR spectrum for the CT at 130 K for H\perpc. The Cu(2)-NMR spectrum for H\perpc splits into two peaks, proving the presence of two Cu(2) sites in the OP with a different second-order quadrupole shift for H\perpc. A neutron-powder-diffraction experiment revealed that the CO_{3} unit introduced into the charge reservoir layers elongates the distance between the apical oxygen and the Cu(2) site in the OP, and suggested the appearance of two inequivalent Cu sites, Cu(2A) and Cu(2B), with the apical oxygens in the original and displaced positions, respectively.^{5} The NMR experiment is consistent with this neutron diffraction result. We note, however, that any difference in the K and T_{1} results is not appreciable between the Cu(2A) and Cu(2B) sites, which assures that the magnetic properties are uniform in the OP. The nuclear quadrupole frequency r_{Q} for the Cu(2A) and Cu(2B) sites are estimated to be \sim 14.7 and 30.0 MHz, respectively, and \nu_{Q}= 11.1 MHz for the Cu(1) site from the frequency (_f_) dependence of the total shift for H\perpc. Unfortunately, we have not succeeded in observing any Cu-NMR signal associated with the (Cu-C) charge reservoir layers. This suggests that some large crystal inhomogeneity may be introduced into these layers due to the partial substitution of CO_{3} units.

In general, K consists of a T-dependent spin part K_{s}(T) and a T-independent orbital part K_{orb}, K_{g}(T)= K_{s,o}(T)+K_{orb,a}(\alpha=ab,c). K_{orb,ab} is estimated to be 0.20% (0.25%) for the IP (OP) from the residual shift at 4.2 K. Figure 2(a) shows the T dependence of K_{s,ab}(T). K_{s,ab}(T) in the IP decreases gradually with decreasing T in the normal state, typical for underdoped high-T_{c} cuprates, whereas that in the OP is greatly enhanced with a nearly T-independent value, typical for overdoped cuprates. It is well established that K_{s,ab} , proportional to the uniform susceptibility \chi_{s} , increases progressively as N_{h} increases. The values of K_{s,ab} in the IP and OP in Cu1234 are compatible with those in the IP of the optimally doped Hg1223 (T_{c} = 133 K),^{3} and those in the heavily overdoped Tl1212 (T_{c} = 64 K)^{11} and Tl2201 (T_{c} = 42 K),^{12} respectively. This contrasting behavior in K_{s,ab}(T) evidences a significant difference between N_{h}(IP) and N_{h}(OP) in Cu1234.

Figure 2(b) shows the T dependence of 1/T_{1}T for H\perpc. In the normal state, 1/T_{1}T in the IP is larger than that in the OP. This is because the antiferromagnetic (AF) spin correlation in the underdoped IP is more pronounced than in the overdoped OP. 1/T_{1}T in the IP exhibits a broad maximum around T^{\ast}\sim 150 K, consistent with the spin-gap behavior observed in underdoped high-T_{c} cuprates. By contrast, 1/T_{1}T in the OP continues to increase down to T_{c} , typical of overdoped cuprates. Both the K and 1/T_{1}T results verify that the OP (IP) is overdoped (underdoped). This is in contrast with results in other multilayered high-T_{c} cuprates, Bi2223,^{1} Hg1223,^{2,3} Hg1234,^{4} and Tl2223.^{13,5} In these compounds, the difference between N_{h}(IP) and N_{h}(OP) does not alter the magnetic and SC properties in the OP and IP. In Cu1234, however, it is anticipated that the large difference between N_{h}(IP) and N_{h}(OP) will bring about a distinct difference not only in the magnetic properties but also in the SC characteristics.

We next focus on the T dependences of K_{s} and 1/T_{1} in the SC state, which reflect the T dependence of the SC gap \Delta(T) in the different planes. As shown in Fig. 2(a), K_{s}(T) in the underdoped IP undergoes a sharp drop below T_{c} = 117 K due to the opening of the SC gap. On the other hand, K_{s}(T) in the overdoped OP decreases gradually below T_{c} = 117 K, followed by a sharp decrease below T_{c}\sim 60 K. In order to unravel the detailed T dependence of K_{s} below T_{c} , its T-derivative value d(K_{s,ab})/dT is plotted against T in Fig. 3(a). It should be noted that d(K_{s,ab})/dT in the IP shows a clear peak just below T_{c} = 117 K, but that in the OP shows the peak not just below T_{c} = 117 K but just below T_{c2} = 60

  K. Likewise, the peak of d(1/T_{1}T)/dT in the IP, as seen in Fig.3(b), appears around T_{c} , whereas that in the OP appears around T_{c2}. In Fig. 4, the T dependences of 1/T_{1} in the IP and the OP are plotted on logarithmic scales. 1/T_{1} in the IP decreases sharply just below T_{c} , followed by a T^{3}-like dependence in the low-T regime. These relaxation behaviors share common features with those observed in other high-T_{c} cuprates, consistent with the d-wave model with a gapless line node. By contrast, 1/T_{1} for the OP decreases gradually below T_{c} = 117 K but sharply below T_{c2} \sim 60 K. In the inset of Fig. 4, (1/T_{1})/(1/T_{1})_{T-T_{c2}} vs T/T_{c2} is indicated for the OP together with (1/T_{1})/(1/T_{1})_{T-T_{c}} vs T/T_{c} for the IP. Here (1/T_{1})_{T-T_{c2}} is 1/T_{1} at T_{c2} = 60 K and (1/T_{1})_{T-T_{c}} at T_{c} = 117 K. The plot in the OP for 0.4<T/T_{c2}<1 is on almost the same line as that in the IP for 0.4<T/T_{c}<1, suggesting that the d-wave SC gap in the OP fully develops not below T_{c} but below T_{c2}.

In order to deduce the T dependence of the SC gap \Delta(T) in the OP, K_{s}(T)/K_{n} normalized by the value K_{n} at T_{c} = 117 K is plotted against T/T_{c} in Fig. 5, together with K_{s}(T)/K_{n} for the IP. It is clear that \Delta(T) in the OP does not fully develop down to T_{c2} in contrast to that in the IP. A two-dimensional d-wave model [14; 15; 16] has been applied to fit the data for the OP since K_{n} is independent of the temperature, but not to the data in the IP since K_{n}(T) decreases with decreasing T. A model with \Delta_{MF}(T) following a conventional mean-field (MF) pattern is not in accord with the slow decrease of K_{s}(T)/K_{n} in the OP between T_{c2} = 60 K and T_{c} = 117 K. Alternatively, as indicated by the solid line in the inset of Fig. 5, the agreement between the experiment and the calculation seems to be satisfactory when it is assumed that \Delta(T)/\Delta(0) increases linearly down to T_{c2} = 60 K and follows the MF type of behavior below T_{c2}. This result shows that the gap in the OP does not fully develop below T_{c} = 117 K but below T_{c2} = 60 K.

In the SC state, the appearance of bulk superconductivity indicates that the SC phase has a coherent character below T_{c} . However, the present NMR study reveals that the SC gap does not develop simultaneously in the IP and the OP. We propose that this dissimilarity is caused by the large difference between N_{h}({\rm IP}) and N_{h}({\rm OP}). Note that N_{h}({\rm OP}) is compatible to those in the overdoped Tl1212 (T_{c} = 64 K) [11] and Tl2201 (43 K). [12] This suggests that the inherent transition temperature in the OP is reduced to T_{c2} = 60 K due to its heavily overdoped level, although the bulk SC transition is triggered by the underdoped IP at T_{c} = 117 K. In this case, the unusual \Delta(T) behavior in the OP between T_{c} and T_{c2} may be interpreted as a kind of "proximity effect" induced by the superconductivity in the IP. This is because the coherent length along c axis is reported to be \xi_{c}\sim 10 A in Cu1234, which is much larger than the distance between the IP and the OP, i.e., \sim 3.2 A. [17]

We note that a further dissimilarity relevant to the large difference between N_{h}({\rm OP}) and N_{h}({\rm IP}) is seen in the normal state. As seen in Fig. 2(b), spin-gap behavior in the IP is extracted from the broad maximum of 1/T_{1}T around T^{*} = 150 K, but not in the OP. In the underdoped and optimally

Figure 5: K_{s}(T)/K_{n} vs T/T_{c} plot for the IP and the OP. K_{s}(T) and K_{n} are the Knight shifts in the superconducting state and at T_{c} , respectively. K_{s}(T)/K_{n} for the OP is reproduced by the d-wave model assuming a T-linear increase of \Delta(T) below T_{c} and follows the BCS form below T_{c2} as shown in the inset.

  doped Hg1223's (Refs. 2,3) and Hg1234,[4] the OP and the IP retain similar SC characteristics as well as magnetic properties, although N_{h}({\rm OP}) and N_{h}({\rm IP}) are different. In this context, we suppose that there is a threshold in the difference between N_{h}({\rm OP}) and N_{h}({\rm IP}) to bring about dissimilarities in the SC and magnetic properties.

In Cu1234, it has been reported that T_{c} keeps a rather high value above T_{c} = 117 K and stays nearly constant regardless of the variation of N_{h} in the overdoped region, N_{h} = 0.35-0.6, which is almost three times larger than N_{h}\sim 0.2 in the optimum region.[10] The fact that T_{c} does not depend on the carrier doping seems to be unique compared with other cuprates in which the T_{c} value decreases drastically on increasing N_{h} in the overdoped region. What the present NMR studies have suggested is that the doping level in the OP is heavily overdoped; however, the IP remains underdoped and sustains a high T_{c} value above 117 K in Cu1234.

In conclusion, the measurements of ^{63}Cu Knight shift and 1/T_{1}T in the overdoped multilayered cuprate Cu1234 reveal that the outer (inner) CuO_{2} planes are heavily overdoped (underdoped). In the normal state, spin-gap behavior is observed in the IP but not in the OP. In the SC state, it was found that the SC gap in the OP does not fully develop below T_{c} = 117 K but below T_{c2} = 60 K. We propose that these dissimilarities are caused by the large difference of doping level between the IP and the OP. Noting that the doping level in the OP is compatible with those in the overdoped Tl1212 (T_{c} = 64 K) and Tl2201 (43 K), it is suggested that the T_{c} inherent to the OP is reduced to T_{c2} = 60 K due to its heavily overdoped level, although the bulk SC transition is triggered by the underdoped IP at T_{c} = 117 K. We would remark that the low anisotropy of SC characteristics[17] in Cu1234 is associated with the heavily overdoped level in the OP and the bulk T_{c} is kept unchanged since the IP remains underdoped.

###### Abstract

We report Cu-NMR studies of the multilayered high-T_{c} cuprate (Cu_{0.6}C_{0.4})Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4}O_{12+y} (Cu1234) with T_{c} = 117 K. In the normal state, the Knight shift (_K_) and the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T_{1}) of ^{63}Cu give evidence that the inner CuO_{2} planes (IP) are underdoped, whereas the outer ones (OP) are heavily overdoped. In the superconducting (SC) state, both K and 1/T_{1} decrease markedly below T_{c} = 117 K in the IP, whereas in the OP they decrease moderately below T_{c} = 117 K, but markedly below T_{c2} = 60 K. The unusual NMR results in the OP reveal that the SC gap does not fully develop down to T_{c2} = 60 K. From comparison with a conventional _d_-wave model, it is shown that the SC gap in the OP increases linearly below T_{c} and follows the mean-field type of T dependence below T_{c2}. We propose that these dissimilarities are caused by the large difference of doping levels between the IP and the OP. The bulk SC transition at T_{c} = 117 K is considered to be triggered by the underdoped IP in Cu1234.

Copper oxide high-T_{c} superconductors commonly include corner-sharing CuO_{2} planes forming a two-dimensional square lattice. Doping hole carriers into the plane is essential for the occurrence of high-T_{c} superconductivity. Various anomalies of physical properties in the normal state as well as the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} strongly depend on the in-plane carrier content N_{h}.

The carriers are homogeneously doped into the planes in mono- or bilayer high-T_{c} cuprates, since all the planes are crystallographically equivalent. This is not the case, however, in multilayered high-T_{c} cuprates, which include three or more CuO_{2} planes in a unit cell. In these compounds, there exist two inequivalent CuO_{2} planes, that is, the outer CuO_{2} planes (denoted as OP) with a pyramidal (five) oxygen coordination and the inner planes (IP) with a square (four) oxygen coordination. The NMR studies reported thus far on the multilayered cuprates Bi2223,[1] Hg1223,[2] and Hg1234 (Ref. [4]) reveal that the carrier content in the OP [N_{h}(OP)] is slightly larger than N_{h}(IP) in the IP. The difference between N_{h}(IP) and N_{h}(OP) is reported to increase in going from the under- to the optimally doped region; however, T_{c} is uniquely determined.[5]^{,}[6] Therefore, this raises the question of which planes can determine the bulk T_{c} of multilayer cuprates, if the doping levels are significantly different between the IP and the OP. Understanding of this issue will give valuable information for considering the role of interlayer coupling in high-T_{c} superconductivity, as well as provide a basis for investigating the superconducting (SC) characteristics of multilayer cuprates.

In this paper we report Cu-NMR studies in the multilayered high-T_{c} cuprate superconductor, (Cu_{1-x}C_{x})Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4}O_{12+y} (Cu1234) which comprises two IP's and the OP's.[7; 8; 9] From measurement of the Hall coefficient, it was inferred that the formal N_{h} average per one CuO_{2} plane in Cu1234 ranges from 0.35 to 0.60, which is significantly larger than those in other multilayered cuprates reported thus far, e.g., N_{h} \sim 0.21 in Hg1234.[10]

In the normal state, the Knight shift (_K_) and the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T_{1}) of ^{63}Cu have proved that the magnetic properties in the OP (IP) are typical of those in heavily overdoped (underdoped) compounds, indicative of a significant difference between N_{h}(OP) and N_{h}(IP). In the SC state, it has been revealed that the SC gap does not develop simultaneously in the IP and the OP. The SC gap in the IP fully develops below T_{c} , but that in the OP increases linearly down to T_{c2} = 60 K below T_{c} = 117 K. We propose that this dissimilarity is caused by the large difference between N_{h}(IP) and N_{h}(OP). Noting that N_{h}(OP) is compatible with those in the overdoped Tl1212 (T_{c} = 64 K) and Tl2201 (43 K), it is suggested that the inherent transition temperature in the OP is reduced to T_{c2} = 60 K due to its heavily overdoped level, and thus the bulk SC transition at T_{c} = 117 K is triggered by the underdoped IP in Cu1234.

A polycrystalline sample of (Cu_{0.6}C_{0.4})Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4}O_{12+y} was prepared by the high-pressure synthesis technique described elsewhere.[7] The superconducting transition tempera  ture T_{c} was determined as 117 K, below which a diamagnetic signal appears in the ac susceptibility, and N_{h} was estimated to be 0.5-0.6 from Hall coefficient measurements. A powder sample, confirmed to be almost a single phase by x-ray diffraction, was magnetically aligned along the c axis. K and 1/T_{1} of ^{63}Cu were measured in the range T = 4.2-300 K at 174.2 MHz and a magnetic field (H\sim 15.5 T) parallel (H\parallelc) and perpendicular (H\perpc) to the c axis. T_{1} was measured as a single component by the saturation-recovery method at the (1/2\leftrightarrow-1/2) central transition (CT).

The NMR spectrum for H\parallelc is shown in the inset of Fig. 1 where the two peaks corresponding to the IP and the OP are well resolved. The results for NMR intensity, K, and T_{1} reveal that the sharp peak at a higher field arises from the Cu(1) site in the IP, and the broad one at a lower field from the Cu(2) site in the OP. Figure 1 shows the ^{63}Cu-NMR spectrum for the CT at 130 K for H\perpc. The Cu(2)-NMR spectrum for H\perpc splits into two peaks, proving the presence of two Cu(2) sites in the OP with a different second-order quadrupole shift for H\perpc. A neutron-powder-diffraction experiment revealed that the CO_{3} unit introduced into the charge reservoir layers elongates the distance between the apical oxygen and the Cu(2) site in the OP, and suggested the appearance of two inequivalent Cu sites, Cu(2A) and Cu(2B), with the apical oxygens in the original and displaced positions, respectively.^{5} The NMR experiment is consistent with this neutron diffraction result. We note, however, that any difference in the K and T_{1} results is not appreciable between the Cu(2A) and Cu(2B) sites, which assures that the magnetic properties are uniform in the OP. The nuclear quadrupole frequency r_{Q} for the Cu(2A) and Cu(2B) sites are estimated to be \sim 14.7 and 30.0 MHz, respectively, and \nu_{Q}= 11.1 MHz for the Cu(1) site from the frequency (_f_) dependence of the total shift for H\perpc. Unfortunately, we have not succeeded in observing any Cu-NMR signal associated with the (Cu-C) charge reservoir layers. This suggests that some large crystal inhomogeneity may be introduced into these layers due to the partial substitution of CO_{3} units.

In general, K consists of a T-dependent spin part K_{s}(T) and a T-independent orbital part K_{orb}, K_{g}(T)= K_{s,o}(T)+K_{orb,a}(\alpha=ab,c). K_{orb,ab} is estimated to be 0.20% (0.25%) for the IP (OP) from the residual shift at 4.2 K. Figure 2(a) shows the T dependence of K_{s,ab}(T). K_{s,ab}(T) in the IP decreases gradually with decreasing T in the normal state, typical for underdoped high-T_{c} cuprates, whereas that in the OP is greatly enhanced with a nearly T-independent value, typical for overdoped cuprates. It is well established that K_{s,ab} , proportional to the uniform susceptibility \chi_{s} , increases progressively as N_{h} increases. The values of K_{s,ab} in the IP and OP in Cu1234 are compatible with those in the IP of the optimally doped Hg1223 (T_{c} = 133 K),^{3} and those in the heavily overdoped Tl1212 (T_{c} = 64 K)^{11} and Tl2201 (T_{c} = 42 K),^{12} respectively. This contrasting behavior in K_{s,ab}(T) evidences a significant difference between N_{h}(IP) and N_{h}(OP) in Cu1234.

Figure 2(b) shows the T dependence of 1/T_{1}T for H\perpc. In the normal state, 1/T_{1}T in the IP is larger than that in the OP. This is because the antiferromagnetic (AF) spin correlation in the underdoped IP is more pronounced than in the overdoped OP. 1/T_{1}T in the IP exhibits a broad maximum around T^{\ast}\sim 150 K, consistent with the spin-gap behavior observed in underdoped high-T_{c} cuprates. By contrast, 1/T_{1}T in the OP continues to increase down to T_{c} , typical of overdoped cuprates. Both the K and 1/T_{1}T results verify that the OP (IP) is overdoped (underdoped). This is in contrast with results in other multilayered high-T_{c} cuprates, Bi2223,^{1} Hg1223,^{2,3} Hg1234,^{4} and Tl2223.^{13,5} In these compounds, the difference between N_{h}(IP) and N_{h}(OP) does not alter the magnetic and SC properties in the OP and IP. In Cu1234, however, it is anticipated that the large difference between N_{h}(IP) and N_{h}(OP) will bring about a distinct difference not only in the magnetic properties but also in the SC characteristics.

We next focus on the T dependences of K_{s} and 1/T_{1} in the SC state, which reflect the T dependence of the SC gap \Delta(T) in the different planes. As shown in Fig. 2(a), K_{s}(T) in the underdoped IP undergoes a sharp drop below T_{c} = 117 K due to the opening of the SC gap. On the other hand, K_{s}(T) in the overdoped OP decreases gradually below T_{c} = 117 K, followed by a sharp decrease below T_{c}\sim 60 K. In order to unravel the detailed T dependence of K_{s} below T_{c} , its T-derivative value d(K_{s,ab})/dT is plotted against T in Fig. 3(a). It should be noted that d(K_{s,ab})/dT in the IP shows a clear peak just below T_{c} = 117 K, but that in the OP shows the peak not just below T_{c} = 117 K but just below T_{c2} = 60

  K. Likewise, the peak of d(1/T_{1}T)/dT in the IP, as seen in Fig.3(b), appears around T_{c} , whereas that in the OP appears around T_{c2}. In Fig. 4, the T dependences of 1/T_{1} in the IP and the OP are plotted on logarithmic scales. 1/T_{1} in the IP decreases sharply just below T_{c} , followed by a T^{3}-like dependence in the low-T regime. These relaxation behaviors share common features with those observed in other high-T_{c} cuprates, consistent with the d-wave model with a gapless line node. By contrast, 1/T_{1} for the OP decreases gradually below T_{c} = 117 K but sharply below T_{c2} \sim 60 K. In the inset of Fig. 4, (1/T_{1})/(1/T_{1})_{T-T_{c2}} vs T/T_{c2} is indicated for the OP together with (1/T_{1})/(1/T_{1})_{T-T_{c}} vs T/T_{c} for the IP. Here (1/T_{1})_{T-T_{c2}} is 1/T_{1} at T_{c2} = 60 K and (1/T_{1})_{T-T_{c}} at T_{c} = 117 K. The plot in the OP for 0.4<T/T_{c2}<1 is on almost the same line as that in the IP for 0.4<T/T_{c}<1, suggesting that the d-wave SC gap in the OP fully develops not below T_{c} but below T_{c2}.

In order to deduce the T dependence of the SC gap \Delta(T) in the OP, K_{s}(T)/K_{n} normalized by the value K_{n} at T_{c} = 117 K is plotted against T/T_{c} in Fig. 5, together with K_{s}(T)/K_{n} for the IP. It is clear that \Delta(T) in the OP does not fully develop down to T_{c2} in contrast to that in the IP. A two-dimensional d-wave model [14; 15; 16] has been applied to fit the data for the OP since K_{n} is independent of the temperature, but not to the data in the IP since K_{n}(T) decreases with decreasing T. A model with \Delta_{MF}(T) following a conventional mean-field (MF) pattern is not in accord with the slow decrease of K_{s}(T)/K_{n} in the OP between T_{c2} = 60 K and T_{c} = 117 K. Alternatively, as indicated by the solid line in the inset of Fig. 5, the agreement between the experiment and the calculation seems to be satisfactory when it is assumed that \Delta(T)/\Delta(0) increases linearly down to T_{c2} = 60 K and follows the MF type of behavior below T_{c2}. This result shows that the gap in the OP does not fully develop below T_{c} = 117 K but below T_{c2} = 60 K.

In the SC state, the appearance of bulk superconductivity indicates that the SC phase has a coherent character below T_{c} . However, the present NMR study reveals that the SC gap does not develop simultaneously in the IP and the OP. We propose that this dissimilarity is caused by the large difference between N_{h}({\rm IP}) and N_{h}({\rm OP}). Note that N_{h}({\rm OP}) is compatible to those in the overdoped Tl1212 (T_{c} = 64 K) [11] and Tl2201 (43 K). [12] This suggests that the inherent transition temperature in the OP is reduced to T_{c2} = 60 K due to its heavily overdoped level, although the bulk SC transition is triggered by the underdoped IP at T_{c} = 117 K. In this case, the unusual \Delta(T) behavior in the OP between T_{c} and T_{c2} may be interpreted as a kind of "proximity effect" induced by the superconductivity in the IP. This is because the coherent length along c axis is reported to be \xi_{c}\sim 10 A in Cu1234, which is much larger than the distance between the IP and the OP, i.e., \sim 3.2 A. [17]

We note that a further dissimilarity relevant to the large difference between N_{h}({\rm OP}) and N_{h}({\rm IP}) is seen in the normal state. As seen in Fig. 2(b), spin-gap behavior in the IP is extracted from the broad maximum of 1/T_{1}T around T^{*} = 150 K, but not in the OP. In the underdoped and optimally

Figure 5: K_{s}(T)/K_{n} vs T/T_{c} plot for the IP and the OP. K_{s}(T) and K_{n} are the Knight shifts in the superconducting state and at T_{c} , respectively. K_{s}(T)/K_{n} for the OP is reproduced by the d-wave model assuming a T-linear increase of \Delta(T) below T_{c} and follows the BCS form below T_{c2} as shown in the inset.

  doped Hg1223's (Refs. 2,3) and Hg1234,[4] the OP and the IP retain similar SC characteristics as well as magnetic properties, although N_{h}({\rm OP}) and N_{h}({\rm IP}) are different. In this context, we suppose that there is a threshold in the difference between N_{h}({\rm OP}) and N_{h}({\rm IP}) to bring about dissimilarities in the SC and magnetic properties.

In Cu1234, it has been reported that T_{c} keeps a rather high value above T_{c} = 117 K and stays nearly constant regardless of the variation of N_{h} in the overdoped region, N_{h} = 0.35-0.6, which is almost three times larger than N_{h}\sim 0.2 in the optimum region.[10] The fact that T_{c} does not depend on the carrier doping seems to be unique compared with other cuprates in which the T_{c} value decreases drastically on increasing N_{h} in the overdoped region. What the present NMR studies have suggested is that the doping level in the OP is heavily overdoped; however, the IP remains underdoped and sustains a high T_{c} value above 117 K in Cu1234.

In conclusion, the measurements of ^{63}Cu Knight shift and 1/T_{1}T in the overdoped multilayered cuprate Cu1234 reveal that the outer (inner) CuO_{2} planes are heavily overdoped (underdoped). In the normal state, spin-gap behavior is observed in the IP but not in the OP. In the SC state, it was found that the SC gap in the OP does not fully develop below T_{c} = 117 K but below T_{c2} = 60 K. We propose that these dissimilarities are caused by the large difference of doping level between the IP and the OP. Noting that the doping level in the OP is compatible with those in the overdoped Tl1212 (T_{c} = 64 K) and Tl2201 (43 K), it is suggested that the T_{c} inherent to the OP is reduced to T_{c2} = 60 K due to its heavily overdoped level, although the bulk SC transition is triggered by the underdoped IP at T_{c} = 117 K. We would remark that the low anisotropy of SC characteristics[17] in Cu1234 is associated with the heavily overdoped level in the OP and the bulk T_{c} is kept unchanged since the IP remains underdoped.
