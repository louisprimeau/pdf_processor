###### Abstract

The roles of Se deficiency and Fe atoms, for the superconductivity of FeSe, have been, respectively, investigated in FeSe\({}_{1-\delta}\) and (Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Cu\({}_{x}\))Se\({}_{1-\delta}\) by our NMR experiments. The data, for nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (\(1/T_{1}\)), show that the spin fluctuations are weakened at a larger \(\delta\), and are correlated with the superconductivity in FeSe. The superconducting volume fraction, estimated by our ac susceptibility experiments, is found to vary inversely with \(\delta\). Our findings suggest that the Se-deficient FeSe has an inhomogeneous phase, where the superconductivity is associated with the regions having few or no Se vacancies. As for (Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Cu\({}_{x}\))Se\({}_{1-\delta}\)\(T_{\rm c}\) is rapidly suppressed by Cu doping and vanishes around \(x\)=0.03. The \({}^{77}\)Se and the \({}^{63}\)Cu NMR linewidths suggest that a local moment is induced at the Fe sites and not at the Cu sites. However, \(1/T_{1}\) shows no obvious change with the Cu doping. We suspect that other effects, such as disorder or change in the density of states, have more influence on \(T_{\rm c}\) suppression since a metal-insulator transition, induced by Cu substitution, occurs in the resistivity measurements.

Among the discovered iron-based superconductors, FeSe\({}_{1-\delta}\) was a binary compound to be found.[1] Though its superconducting temperature, \(T_{\rm c}\)\(\sim\) 8 K, is not as high as those in the class of iron-arsenic superconductors, FeSe\({}_{1-\delta}\) has quickly drawn considerable attention, due to its structural simplicity and easier material handling. Recent high-pressure experiments have even raised its \(T_{\rm c}\) up to 36.7 K, which is comparable to the FeAs-based superconductors.[2] This has made FeSe a potential paradigm for investigating the mechanism of superconductivity in the Fe-based superconductors. Indeed, FeSe has been found to share a number of features with the FeAs-based superconductors, including layered structures, electronic states, and lattice instability.[3, 4, 5] However, still unclear is whether or not FeSe is similar to the iron arsenides, with regard to spin-density-wave instability or magnetic order.[2, 6] Recent high-pressure NMR experiments, on the other hand, have demonstrated strong spin correlation with the superconductivity in FeSe, as also found in other iron arsenides.[7, 8] Further investigation must determine whether or not the spin-fluctuation-driven picture, of the Cooper-pairing mechanism, is applicable to the Fe-based superconductors. Here, we report our NMR studies on the Se-deficient and Cu-substituted FeSe.

Iron selenide has complex structural phases, as summarized in the original literature where the superconductivity was reported in the Se-deficient tetragonal \(\beta\)-FeSe, i.e., FeSe\({}_{0.82}\) and FeSe\({}_{0.88}\).[1] A similar finding soon followed, for a composition of FeSe\({}_{0.92}\),[9] However, McQueen _et al._ have recently claimed that the superconductivity actually exists only in the nearly stoichiometric FeSe and a small Se deficiency (\(\delta\)=0.03) is enough to destroy the Cooper pairing.[10] Though they attributed this discrepancy to the oxygen contamination in those Se-deficient samples, it is intriguing to ask why any oxygen contamination, in FeSe\({}_{0.88}\) and FeSe\({}_{0.92}\), would produce a similar \(T_{\rm c}\) as FeSe\({}_{0.99}\). Clarifying the role of Se deficiency, in FeSe, is crucial to any theoretical treatments of the pairing mechanism because it determines whether or not it is essential to introduce charge carriers in the two-dimensional (2D) FeSe layers, as compared to the cuprate superconductors.

The role of the Fe\({}^{2+}\) spin is another interesting issue, which has recently been investigated by chemically substituting Fe for Cu, i.e., (Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Cu\({}_{x}\))Se\({}_{1-\delta}\)[11, 12] The superconductivity is rapidly suppressed by the Cu doping and is followed by a metal-insulator transition. Cu\({}^{2+}\) and Fe\({}^{2+}\) have the same valence electrons but posses different spins and atomic radii. This chemical substitution is generally expected to alter the lattice and electronic structures, to introduce disorder and modify spin correlation. However, which one most dominates needs clarification.

We have conducted experiments for \({}^{77}\)Se NMR spectrum and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (\(1/T_{1}\)), on Se-deficient FeSe\({}_{0.88}\) and Cu-doped (Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Cu\({}_{x}\))Se\({}_{1-\delta}\) to investigate the role of Se deficiency and magnetic correlation in FeSe. Our findings suggest that spin fluctuations are closely related to the superconductivity in FeSe, as previously reported by Imai _et al.[7]_ Our \(1/T_{1}\) and superconducting volume fraction analysis indicate that the Se-deficient FeSe has an inhomogeneous electronic state, where the pairing occurs only in the regions having few or no Se vacancy, expanding upon similar results from previously reported NMR data. This is supported by the decrease in spin fluctuation and superconducting volume fraction at larger \(\delta\). As for (Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Cu\({}_{x}\))Se\({}_{1-\delta}\) we find that the NMR linewidth increases drastically upon Cu doping and then saturates. Whether or not this Cu-induced disorder is correlated with the rapid suppression of \(T_{\rm c}\) needs further investigation. Interestingly, the \(1/T_{1}\) is nearly unchanged upon Cu doping. We suspect that the electronic band structure is altered more significantly than the spin dynamics because a metal-insulator transition was shown in the resistivity measurements.[1]

Polycrystalline samples of the Se-deficient FeSe\({}_{0.88}\) and the Cu-substituted (Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Cu\({}_{x}\))Se\({}_{1-\delta}\) with \((x,\delta)\) = (0, 0.12), (0.01, 0.15), (0.02, 0.12), (0.03, 0.12), and (0.04, 0.12) were used in our NMR and ac magnetic-susceptibility experiments. Sample preparation was similar to that of (Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Cu\({}_{x}\))Se\({}_{0.85}\) in Ref. [11]. Figure 1 gives the powder x-ray diffraction patterns of these samples. Rietveld refinement was analyzed by using GSAS software, to confirm the sample stoichiometry and quality. Detailed structural analysis shows  similar features as for (Fe1-Cu3)Se0.85 in Ref. 11. Figure 2 shows the resistivity (normalized to 300 K) of different Cu contents. As in (Fe1-xCu3)Se0.85 and (Fe1-01-Cu3)Se, a metal-insulator transition is also observed in our (Fe1-xCu3)Se0.88 samples.[11, 12]

To our knowledge, there are only three NMR papers, to date, reporting on superconductivity in FeSe1-_b_ Imai _et al._ measured the nearly stoichiometric FeSe0.99 and FeSe0.97, with the samples claimed to be free of oxygen contamination.[7] Kotegawa _et al._[13] and Masaki _et al._[8] studied the Se-deficient FeSe0.92 but did not specify whether or not there was any oxygen contamination. In order to resolve the discrepancy, regarding the stoichiometry of the superconductivity in FeSe, the following discussions compare our FeSe0.88 data, with the data reproduced from the previous literature. Standard Hahn-echo pulse sequences and saturation pulses were, respectively, employed throughout our 77Se NMR spectra and 1/_T_1 experiments at 75 kG.

Figure 3 shows the 77Se NMR spectra of FeSe1-_b_ at 10 K. The linewidth increases with the Se deficiency, as expected because NMR linewidth generally reflects the amount of lattice disorder in the sample. This indirectly confirms the correct stoichiometry of these samples. Similar _T_e = 8 K, observed in the disordered FeSe0.88 and ordered FeSe0.99, suggests that the Cooper pairing is not vulnerable to the lattice disorder induced by the Se vacancy. We notice that the frequency shift (_K_) does not vary much with \(d\) (Fig. 3, inset), which means that the local spin susceptibility _kh_ does not change much either because \(K\)  _kh_. These results differ from those, in the report on bulk susceptibilities, by Williams _et al._, in which bulk susceptibility increases significantly with \(d\), due to the impurity phases from excess Fe or iron oxides. If these magnetic impurities were bonded to the FeSe samples, magnetic broadening of the linewidth would also be seen at low temperature. The linewidth for our FeSe0.88 is nearly temperature independent, from 70 K down to _T_c (not shown), as was the case for FeSe0.92 in Ref. 13. Therefore, our NMR frequency shift and linewidth data suggest that any impurity phases would not enter the FeSe1-_b_ stoichiometry but we cannot rule out the possibility of oxygen contamination in FeSe1-_b_ as McQueen _et al._[10] pointed out, for FeSe1-_b_Oy. We will leave this issue to a later discussion.

Figure 4 displays a typical nuclear spin-lattice relaxation curve [_M_(_t_): nuclear magnetization as a function of time] for FeSe0.88 at 16 K. Stretched exponential behavior [\(\epsilon^{-(t/T_{1})^{n}}\)] is observed, in contrast to the single exponential in FeSe0.99 and FeSe0.97. This means that \(T\)1 is distributed in FeSe0.88, due to Se-vacancy-induced disorder. We note that the single exponential, in the nearly stoichiometric FeSe polycrystal samples, implies a nearly isotropic \(T\)1, although it possesses a 2D layered structure. A stretched exponential, caused by anisotropic \(T\)1, is then ruled out. The inset shows the stretched exponent (_a_) obtained from a stretched exponential curve fitting. This temperature-dependent exponent implies that different Se sites have different temperature-dependent 1/_T_1. Similar behavior was also reported in FeSe0.92.[13]

The relaxation rate from the stretched fit is plotted in Fig. 5. The Korringa-type behavior (_T_1_T_=const), for temperatures between _T_c and 50 K, in FeSe0.88 and FeSe0.92, is actually misleading because both 1/_T_1 values are directly from the stretched exponential fit. These stretched data cannot reflect the true average behavior for 1/(_T_1_T_) since the stretched exponent is known to be temperature dependent. Masaki _et al._ have fit their FeSe0.92 relaxation curves, using a

  two-\(T_{1}\) function, and found that the short \(T_{1}\) component displays an enhanced \(1/T_{1}\) that is similar to FeSe\({}_{0.99}\).[8] The upward \(1/(T_{1}T)\), just above \(T_{c}\), has been considered as evidence for the connection of spin fluctuations to superconductivity in FeSe.[7] In order to catch the intrinsic feature from the distributed \(T_{1}\), we calculated the average \(1/T_{1}\), directly from the initial slope of the relaxation curve,[14] instead of the two-\(T_{1}\) fit. Figure 6 (filled circles) gives the average \(1/(T_{1}T)\) data for our FeSe\({}_{0.88}\). Indeed, similar uprising behavior, at low temperature, is seen in our sample, in contrast to the flat behavior in the nonsuperconducting FeSe\({}_{0.97}\). Note that the drop of \(1/(T_{1}T)\) below \(T_{c}\), expected from the opening of the superconducting gap, is smeared out due to the broad \(1/T_{1}\) distribution.

We can see that the size of the spin fluctuations seems to decrease with \(\delta\), for the superconducting samples, by looking at the \(1/(T_{1}T)\) value just above \(T_{c}\) (Fig. 5). If the magnetic fluctuations are strongly linked to the Cooper pairing in FeSe, why do FeSe\({}_{0.99}\), FeSe\({}_{0.92}\), and FeSe\({}_{0.88}\) show similar onset \(T_{c}\)? The superconducting volume fraction estimated from our ac susceptibility experiment may provide a clue. Figure 7 (open circles) shows our dynamical magnetic-susceptibility data for FeSe\({}_{0.88}\). It was measured by using the \(LC\) resonant circuit originally for NMR experiments.[7] This method utilizes the resonance frequency \(\omega\) (\(\sim\)\(1/\sqrt{LC}\)) of the \(LC\) circuit which changes with the inductance, which in turn depends on the sample susceptibility \(\chi\). That is, \(L\)=\(L_{0}\)[1 + 4\(\pi\chi(T)\)], \(L_{0}\): inductance of the NMR coil. The rising of the frequency-shift ratio [defined as \(\omega(T)/\omega(15)\)\(-\)1] in Fig. 7 represents the superconducting transition because \(\omega\) increases as it enters the superconducting state, \(\chi\)\(<\)0. The size of the frequency-shift ratio gives a rough estimate of the superconducting volume fraction.

We found that FeSe\({}_{0.88}\) has a superconducting volume fraction significantly smaller than FeSe\({}_{0.99}\) since FeSe\({}_{0.88}\) has a smaller frequency-shift ratio. The dc bulk susceptibilities, reported in Ref. [12], show the similar result of a weaker superconducting diamagnetic response in FeSe\({}_{0.82}\), if the background signal from impurities is subtracted. Note that the pressure experiment on FeSe\({}_{0.99}\) shows that \(T_{c}\) and superconducting volume fraction vary simultaneously with pressure,[7] unlike in the Se-deficient case, where only superconducting volume fraction varies with Se deficiency. We also did the two-\(T_{1}\) analysis for our FeSe\({}_{0.88}\) and found that the volume fraction, for the short \(T_{1}\) component, is about 50%, which is 10% less than that in FeSe\({}_{0.92}\).[8]

Combining the reduced superconducting volume fraction in the Se-deficient FeSe with the findings from the previous discussions, i.e., the different temperature-dependent \(1/T_{1}\) at different Se sites and the reduced spin fluctuations at a larger \(\delta\), we infer that the Se-deficient FeSe has an inhomogeneous phase, where the superconductivity comes from regions with few or no Se vacancies. The Se-vacancy-free region has much stronger magnetic fluctuations than the Se-vacant region. When greater vacancy is introduced in FeSe, both the overall spin fluctuations and superconducting volume fraction decrease. However, this picture cannot explain why the superconductivity disappears in FeSe\({}_{0.97}\).[10] Is this really due to the oxygen contamination in those Se-deficient samples so that the superconductivity is actually from FeSe\({}_{1-\delta}\)O\({}_{y}\), instead of FeSe\({}_{1-\delta}\)? An oxygen-free FeSe\({}_{0.82}\) has been reported by Williams _et al._, with magnetic susceptibility clearly showing a superconducting diamagnetic response, if the background signal from impurities is subtracted.[12] Therefore, we think it unlikely that occurrence of any oxygen contamination is the cause. While preparing this paper, we noticed that a different result was recently reported, where the superconductivity was claimed to exist in a narrow range of \(\delta\)=0.03, i.e., FeSe\({}_{0.974\pm 0.005}\).[15] These recent experiments, together with our own, indicate that the superconductivity emerges from the nearly stoichiometric FeSe.

Figure 8(a) shows the \({}^{77}\)Se NMR spectra in the normal state of (Fe\({}_{1-\delta}\)Cu\({}_{x}\))Se\({}_{1-\delta}\) at 15 K, where the linewidth increases rapidly upon Cu doping and then saturates. This implies that Cu substitution induces a magnetic moment so that the line broadening is dominated by magnetic disorder, rather

Data for FeSe\({}_{0.92}\) (reproduced from Ref. [13]) and FeSe\({}_{0.88}\) are stretched-\(T_{1}\) values (see text).

  than by structural disorder. Judging by the rapid increase in the \({}^{77}\)Se NMR linewidth, the disorder effects may or may not correlate with the rapid suppression of \(T_{\rm c}\) by the Cu doping. In contrast, the \({}^{63}\)Cu linewidth [Fig. 8(b)] gradually decreases with the Cu doping, which suggests that the induced moments are not at the Cu sites but at Fe sites.

So why do \({}^{63}\)Cu and \({}^{77}\)Se linewidths behave so differently? Normally the NMR spectrum becomes wider and more asymmetric when the increase in doping level is begun.[16, 17] But here, the \({}^{63}\)Cu linewidth can come from both the doping-induced magnetic shift distribution, and the powder patterns due to the anisotropic shifts and quadrupolar effects. The broad shoulders, on both sides of the central peak, are caused by the quadrupolar broadening. Because these broad shoulders stay nearly unchanged, unlike the central peak which sharpens at higher Cu doping, the quadrupolar effects probably do not cause the narrowing of the central peak. Note that the centroid of the spectrum moves closer to the unshifted reference line at higher Cu doping, which implies that the Cu nuclei do not much feel the hyperfine fields, from the neighboring Fe/Cu spins, at a higher doping levels. Since there is no direct chemical bonding between the Cu and Fe atoms, part of the \({}^{63}\)Cu frequency shift at low Cu doping comes from the transferred hyperfine coupling, mediated by the conduction electrons. For higher Cu doping, we suspect that the metal-insulator transition reduces the number of conduction electrons so that the transferred hyperfine coupling becomes weaker. Therefore, both the magnetic shift and linewidth decrease at higher Cu doping. This is different from the \({}^{77}\)Se spectra, where there is direct wave-function overlap between the Se \(4p\) and Fe \(3d\) electrons so that the \({}^{77}\)Se nucleus can always effectively probe the Fe spins, to show a broader linewidth at higher doping (Fig. 9).

As with Se-deficient FeSe, stretched exponential behavior is observed in the spin-lattice relaxation curves for all (Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Cu\({}_{x}\))Se\({}_{1-\phi}\). Their average (\(T_{1}T\))\({}^{-1}\) curves are plotted in Fig. 6. Within experimental error, all of our samples show similar average \(1/(T_{1}T)\) behavior, the values increasing at lower temperature. Interestingly, Cu substitution does not alter spin fluctuation in FeSe\({}_{0.88}\), though Cu\({}^{2+}\) possesses a spin different from Fe\({}^{2+}\). We note that both superconducting volume fraction and \(T_{\rm c}\) rapidly decreases, upon Cu doping. This is different from the Se-deficient samples, where only superconducting volume fraction reduces significantly. The similar superconducting volume fraction, found in (Fe\({}_{0.99}\)Cu\({}_{0.01}\))Se\({}_{0.85}\) and (Fe\({}_{0.98}\)Cu\({}_{0.02}\))Se\({}_{0.88}\), could be an effect of compensation, due to the different values of \(x\) and \(\delta\). Recent transport experiments, on (Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Cu\({}_{x}\))Se\({}_{1-\phi}\) have shown that increasing Cu doping migrates the metallic state to a Mott insulator.[11, 12] Therefore, we suspect that the suppression of \(T_{\rm c}\) is mainly due to the change in the electronic states rather than the spin dynamics.

In summary, we conducted comprehensive studies of the \({}^{77}\)Si NMR in the Se-deficient and Cu-substituted FeSe. By comparing our data with previous literature, we infer that FeSe\({}_{1-\delta}\) has an inhomogeneous phase, where the superconductivity emerges from regions with little or no Se vacancy. As for the \(T_{\rm c}\) suppression in (Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Cu\({}_{x}\))Se\({}_{1-\phi}\) magnetic fluctuations are not directly relevant. We suspect that it is the electronic states that change most with Cu substitution so that a metal-insulator transition arises after \(T_{\rm c}\) is suppressed.
