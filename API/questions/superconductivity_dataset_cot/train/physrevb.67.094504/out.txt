###### Abstract

The tunneling technique with a break junction has been applied to investigate the multiple superconducting gaps in MgB_{2}. The observed gap features can be explained by combining inherent and induced order parameters. The largest gap of \Delta = 9 - 10 meV corresponds to a very strong-coupling ratio 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c} = 5 - 6. Upon warming, this gap decreases in accordance with the BCS dependence, while the smaller gaps reduce faster than that but persist up to T_{c}. Therefore, the smallest gap of \Delta = 2 - 2.5 meV gives 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c} = 1.2 - 1.5. The magnetic field can distinguish the behavior of the gap. The extrapolated highest gap-closing field for the largest gap agrees with the upper-critical field, thereby indicating that this gap is predominant to MgB_{2}.

2003 14 March 2003 10.1103/PhysRevB.67.094504 2003 14 March 2 neling conductance with the predominant smaller gap \Delta_{2}. The calculated curves almost agree with the experimental data. This indicates that the outer humps and peaks are due to the gap-edge crossing consisting of \Delta_{1} and \Delta_{2} in the SIS junction. For (a) and (b), almost common values of \Delta_{1}^{0} = 6.9\pm 0.4 meV are obtained. The no leakage conductance bottom of (a) reflects a nonzero value of \Delta_{2}^{0}. On the other hand, no inherent pairing potential in the induced part is suggested in (b) by \Delta_{2}^{0} = 0. In spite of this difference, the values of \Delta_{2}^{0} + \Gamma_{2} = 2.8 meV in both (a) and (b) are consistent with each other, which yields the similar inner gap-peak positions.[13] Figure 1(c) shows a broadened large-gap structure, which can be fitted by the density of states for the larger gap (\Delta_{1}). The existence of \Delta_{2} nested in \Delta_{1} inevitably fits the data better, thereby indicating that the correlated two-gap (proximity tunneling) model is suitable even for this large gap. Significantly, the \Delta_{1}^{0}\sim 10 meV in (c) is much larger than that of (a) and (b). We have also observed a signature of the large gap in the predominant small gap (\Delta_{2}) spectrum, as shown in (d). In (c) and (d), the values \Delta_{2}^{0} + \Gamma_{2} = 6.3 \pm 0.7 meV are close to \Delta_{1}^{0} of (a) and (b), thereby demonstrating an inherent systematic feature of the induced order parameter.

The T evolution of the tunneling conductance for the largest gap like in Fig. 1(c) is shown in Fig. 2. T_{c}\approx 39 K can be determined by the T dependence of the zero-bias conductance (ZBC) (except for the ZB peak) (the right inset). The

  low-bias fine structures probably reflect the smaller gaps shown in Fig. 1. The increased broadening upon warming is due to the thermal transfer of the spectral weight accompanying the increasing quasiparticle scattering. The left inset shows the T evolution of a similar gap size from another junction with distinct gap features at higher T, which indicates the bulk nature of the largest gap. The T variations of the smaller gap are shown in Fig. 3 from two different break junctions, where outer humps are commonly observed at low T. The distinct gap feature exists up to near T_{c} for both (a) and (b). The humps are visible up to high T for (a), while those for (b) are rapidly obscured upon warming. The broken curves in Fig. 3 represent the fitting results using the above correlated two-gap model.[13] In particular, the calculated curves for (a) explain the observed spectral shapes almost perfectly at any temperatures up to T_{c}. The substantial deviation at low biases is seen in (b) [and (a) at low T]. The small deviations are also seen for the outer humps. These disagreements may be related to the complex tunneling process such as two-particle tunneling, because the biases of the subgap peaks or shoulders at low T are exactly half the value of biases of the main-gap peaks. It should be possible to reduce these disagreements by introducing additional intergap coupling parameters. Figure 3 demonstrates the reproducible outer humps and/or shoulders by calculations using the known correlated two-gap model even at high temperatures near T_{c}.[13] The fitted parameters at 4.2 K are \Delta_{1}^{0} = 7.5(6.4) meV, \Gamma_{1}= 3(1.2) meV, \Delta_{2}^{0}= 0.5(1.6) meV, and \Gamma_{2}= 3.2(0.9) meV for (a) [(b)]. \Delta_{1}^{0}= 6.4-7.5 meV is noted to be consistent with that of Figs. 1(a) and (b).

Figure 4 shows the T dependence of the gap parameter \Delta(T). For the middle [\approx6-7.5 meV (at 4 K)] gaps, \Delta(T) is obtained from the conductance fitting, while that of the largest (\approx9-10 meV) and smallest (2-2.5 meV) gaps is obtained by either the peak positions or the fittings. All the data converge at single T_{c}\approx 39 K, regardless of the gap size and its low-T behavior. For the largest gap, it almost agrees with the BCS \Delta (T). It is remarkable that the middle size (7.5 meV) gap starts to deviate form the BCS \Delta (T) at \approx20 K, while another middle gap (\approx6 meV) undergoes an almost linear T dependence that is extrapolated to the value close to 7.5 meV at 0 K. The latter feature, which is similar to the PES results,[4] resembles the proximity-induced gap found in the conventional superconductor.[17] The deviation from the BCS curve at high T can also be seen in the smallest 2-2.5 meV gap, but it never exhibits a linear decrease unlike the 6-meV gap. From these facts, at least the middle gap is suggested to arise from a proximity-induced origin.[17]

The largest gap ratio 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}= 5-6 for the \Delta\approx 9-10 meV gap is consistent with the tunneling data by Bugoslavsky _et al.[8]_ and the NMR data,[2] but inconsistent with the other tunneling and PES measurements having a BCS size or less.[3, 4, 5, 6, 7] By adopting the relationship 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c} = 3.5 \{1+12.5(k_{B}T_{c}/E_{\rm ln})^{2}\ln(E_{\rm ln}/2\ k_{B}T_{c})\} for the isotropic, single-band strong-coupling superconductor,[18] the ratio >5 implies the logarithmic average energy of E_{\rm ln}<10-15 meV. This is much lower than E_{\rm ln}\approx58 meV of the inelastic neutron experiment.[19] This discrepancy indicates the difference between the bare phonon density of states and electron-coupled phonon spectrum, which can be related to

The asterisks are taken from the other junction to demonstrate the reproducibility. The thin solid curve represents a normal BCS prediction with T_{c}= 39 K, while the broken curves are the scaled ones. The broken straight line gives a simple linear extrapolation.

  the anisotropic nature of the electron-phonon interaction.[11, 20] Since MgB_{2} possesses multiple Fermi surfaces consisting of boron p_{x,y} and p_{z} bands, different gaps could coexist in the clean limit.[11] Since the p_{x,y} band more strongly contributes to the Fermi-surface state density, a strong electron-phonon interaction and a large energy gap can be in fact realized. It should be noted that the gap ratio 5-6 obtained here coincides well with that of the layered nitride superconductor with T_{c}= 26 K.[21] The above gap ratio does not seems to be a marginal extension of the conventional strong-coupling feature because of no such a large ratio in the superconductors except for copper-oxides.[22]

Among the multiple gap features, the distinct small gap of \Delta = 2-2.5 meV with 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c} = 1.2-1.5 is in fact quite unusual for the reason that the gap ratio should not be less than 3.5 for the simple BCS theory. Nevertheless this feature can be explained by the induced order parameters. Since the tunneling density of states and the T dependence of the gaps are very similar between the two band model and the proximity effect, as already stated, it is difficult to distinguish between them from the spectral fittings.[12, 13] The key feature is the observation of more than two gaps with single T_{c} . This is incompatible with the simple isotropic two-band superconductivity. Assuming the proximity-induced gap, \Delta (T) would undergo a steplike change at the reduced T_{c} , or continue to persist up to bulk T_{c} , depending on the coupling between the surface and the bulk electronic states.[12, 13] In this case, the small \Delta (0) and non-BCS \Delta (T) in Fig. 4 could occur depending on the junction condition. The possible existence of pronounced extrema in the anisotropic gaps, as predicted by the band calculation of the extremely anisotropic Fermi surface, could also be the origin of more than two gaps with a small gap,[11] which, however, remain to be experimentally examined. Concerning the small gap, the PES revealed a small surface-derived band around \Gamma point in the Brillouin zone, which could be connected with the observed small gap.[23]

We further investigate the multi gaps observed here by applying the magnetic field (B), where the superconductivity is suppressed in a different way from the thermal effect.[24] Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show the tunneling conductance at various magnetic fields, which are applied perpendicular to the tunneling currents. The largest single gap is presented in (a), while the two-gap feature is shown in (b). Unfortunately, distinct gap features as in Fig. 1 are not stable when a magnetic field is applied. Therefore, the field dependence is examined with broader gaps, which are usually stable against magnetic fields. Further, we choose the data exhibiting no zero-bias peak [except for the inset of (b)], because such a leakage could cause the excessive local pair breaking owing to the current-induced field near the junction. The gap values in (b) under the fields are obtained by fitting procedures using the weighted sum of the broadened BCS density of states.[25] The apparent shift of the energies of the multigap in the field is demonstrated in the inset of (b). These apparent gap-peak positions are almost consistent with the gap energies determined by the fitting. Since MgB_{2} is a type-II superconductor with the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa\sim 26, the gap in the field probed by break-junction tunneling is assumed to be a specially averaged order parameter in the vortex states.[26] With an increasing field, the gap-edge peak shifts to lower bias accompanying the broadening. Since the Zeemann energy (\sim60 \mueV/T) is much smaller than the gap energy, the observed gap-closing feature is attributed to the

The broken curves represent the fitting results (see the text). Inset: apparent multigap feature under the field. (c) Magnetic-field dependence of the gap value. The broken curves represent \Delta(B) = \Delta(B = 0) [1-B/B_{c}]^{1/2}, (d) The gap-closing field B_{c} vs the zero-field gap value \Delta (B = 0). The broken curve represents B_{c}\approx\Delta^{2}.

  breaking up of cooper pairs in the condensate. In Fig. 5(c), the field dependence of the gap \Delta(B) is plotted up to 8 T with the expression \Delta(B) = \Delta(B = 0)\{1 - B/B_{c}\}^{1/2} for the type-II BCS superconductor (broken curves).[26]B_{c} represents the gap-closing field determined from the above expression. The extrapolations using this expression for the larger gap are done on the basis of the agreement between the experimental data and calculated \Delta(B) for the smaller gap. Therefore, ambiguity remains in determining B_{c} for the larger gap. Nevertheless, here we adopt extrapolated values because their widths apparently decrease as shown in (a), which can be fitted by the above expression of \Delta(B) by choosing the appropriate B_{c}. In Fig. 5(d), B_{c} vs \Delta is plotted from the fitting results in (c) and other data. The errors are mainly owing to different junctions showing the similar gap sizes. This is probably due to either the geometrical difference in the flux penetration or a possible manifestation of the gap anisotropy. The extrapolated value of B_{c}  18-20 T for the \Delta  9 meV gap is comparable to the upper-critical field 20-23 T along the _ab_ plane (parallel to the Mg-B sheets) from the magnetic measurements,[15] thereby indicating that this gap is predominant to MgB_{2}. B_{c} increases with increasing \Delta for \Delta > 5- 6 meV. We can compare the behavior in (d) with the relationship B_{c} = a\Delta(B = 0)^{2}\{a\ \approx 0.21 - 0.28\ \text{T}/(\text{meV})^{2}\} for \Delta > 5- 6 meV using the Ginzburg-Landau theory.[27] The approximate agreement between the above expression and the experimental data indicates that the B_{c} is determined by \Delta (0 K) rather than T_{c}, violating the simple relationship \Delta \proptoT_{c}. From the above coefficient a = 2\,\pi^{3}/\epsilon\,h\upsilon_{F}^{2}, the Fermi velocity is estimated to be v_{F}  2.4-2.8\times10^{5} m/s, which is smaller but roughly consistent with that from the calculation.[28] Further, B_{c} becomes almost independent of \Delta for \Delta < 4 meV. This can be explained by assuming the induced superconducting phase, in which the coherence length for \Delta < 4 meV does not become so large because of the induced small v_{F}. A tiny fraction of the nonsuperconducting phase distributed in the bulk MgB_{2} (Ref. [16]) is also a possible origin, which acts as the magnetic pinning center. It is noted that the value of \Delta \approx 5- 6 meV in the crossover region is close to the BCS value with T_{c} = 39 K. From the above extrapolating procedures, the magnetic field distinguishes the behavior of gaps with the larger \Delta before the larger \Delta above \approx5 meV. This is in contrast to the \Delta(T), where different gap sizes possess the _same_T_{c}. From Fig. 5, the physical properties should exhibit an anomaly at B_{c}\sim 7-13 T for the 2-meV gap. The upper critical field at 0 K along the c axis (perpendicular to the Mg-B sheets) (\sim4-8 T) determined by the magnetic measurements is indeed not so different from the above value, but there is a certain discrepancy between them. This suggests that the 2-meV gap perhaps does not directly reflect the c-axis properties. On the other hand, B_{c} \sim 7-10 T for the \sim5-meV gap is rather close to the above upper-critical field. These facts imply that the different gap values could be classified into larger groups. Apparently, single-crystal measurements in several magnetic-field directions are necessary to find out the exact correlations between the crystallographic direction and the gap size with its suppression field B_{c}.

In summary, break-junction tunneling measurements of MgB_{2} clarify the multigap structures distributing \Delta  2-10 meV with 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c} = 1.2-6. The conductance features agree with the correlated two-gap model. The observed small gap as well as the non-BCS \Delta(T) is consistent with the behavior of induced order parameters. The magnetic field reveals a higher extrapolated gap-closing field B_{c} for the larger gap for \Delta > 5 meV, but B_{c} becomes almost independent of \Delta below 5 meV. The B_{c} for the largest gap \Delta \approx 10 meV almost agrees with the upper-critical field along the Mg-B sheets. Therefore, this gap can be predominant to MgB_{2}. The largest ratio 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c} = 5-6 well exceeds the largest strong-coupling ratio (\sim4.3) for the conventional inter-metallic superconductors, which deserves to study further. After finishing this work, we have found a similar conductance fitting for the induced (smaller) gap \Delta_{2} at low temperature.[29]

###### Abstract

The tunneling technique with a break junction has been applied to investigate the multiple superconducting gaps in MgB_{2}. The observed gap features can be explained by combining inherent and induced order parameters. The largest gap of \Delta = 9 - 10 meV corresponds to a very strong-coupling ratio 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c} = 5 - 6. Upon warming, this gap decreases in accordance with the BCS dependence, while the smaller gaps reduce faster than that but persist up to T_{c}. Therefore, the smallest gap of \Delta = 2 - 2.5 meV gives 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c} = 1.2 - 1.5. The magnetic field can distinguish the behavior of the gap. The extrapolated highest gap-closing field for the largest gap agrees with the upper-critical field, thereby indicating that this gap is predominant to MgB_{2}.

2003 14 March 2003 10.1103/PhysRevB.67.094504 2003 14 March 2 neling conductance with the predominant smaller gap \Delta_{2}. The calculated curves almost agree with the experimental data. This indicates that the outer humps and peaks are due to the gap-edge crossing consisting of \Delta_{1} and \Delta_{2} in the SIS junction. For (a) and (b), almost common values of \Delta_{1}^{0} = 6.9\pm 0.4 meV are obtained. The no leakage conductance bottom of (a) reflects a nonzero value of \Delta_{2}^{0}. On the other hand, no inherent pairing potential in the induced part is suggested in (b) by \Delta_{2}^{0} = 0. In spite of this difference, the values of \Delta_{2}^{0} + \Gamma_{2} = 2.8 meV in both (a) and (b) are consistent with each other, which yields the similar inner gap-peak positions.[13] Figure 1(c) shows a broadened large-gap structure, which can be fitted by the density of states for the larger gap (\Delta_{1}). The existence of \Delta_{2} nested in \Delta_{1} inevitably fits the data better, thereby indicating that the correlated two-gap (proximity tunneling) model is suitable even for this large gap. Significantly, the \Delta_{1}^{0}\sim 10 meV in (c) is much larger than that of (a) and (b). We have also observed a signature of the large gap in the predominant small gap (\Delta_{2}) spectrum, as shown in (d). In (c) and (d), the values \Delta_{2}^{0} + \Gamma_{2} = 6.3 \pm 0.7 meV are close to \Delta_{1}^{0} of (a) and (b), thereby demonstrating an inherent systematic feature of the induced order parameter.

The T evolution of the tunneling conductance for the largest gap like in Fig. 1(c) is shown in Fig. 2. T_{c}\approx 39 K can be determined by the T dependence of the zero-bias conductance (ZBC) (except for the ZB peak) (the right inset). The

  low-bias fine structures probably reflect the smaller gaps shown in Fig. 1. The increased broadening upon warming is due to the thermal transfer of the spectral weight accompanying the increasing quasiparticle scattering. The left inset shows the T evolution of a similar gap size from another junction with distinct gap features at higher T, which indicates the bulk nature of the largest gap. The T variations of the smaller gap are shown in Fig. 3 from two different break junctions, where outer humps are commonly observed at low T. The distinct gap feature exists up to near T_{c} for both (a) and (b). The humps are visible up to high T for (a), while those for (b) are rapidly obscured upon warming. The broken curves in Fig. 3 represent the fitting results using the above correlated two-gap model.[13] In particular, the calculated curves for (a) explain the observed spectral shapes almost perfectly at any temperatures up to T_{c}. The substantial deviation at low biases is seen in (b) [and (a) at low T]. The small deviations are also seen for the outer humps. These disagreements may be related to the complex tunneling process such as two-particle tunneling, because the biases of the subgap peaks or shoulders at low T are exactly half the value of biases of the main-gap peaks. It should be possible to reduce these disagreements by introducing additional intergap coupling parameters. Figure 3 demonstrates the reproducible outer humps and/or shoulders by calculations using the known correlated two-gap model even at high temperatures near T_{c}.[13] The fitted parameters at 4.2 K are \Delta_{1}^{0} = 7.5(6.4) meV, \Gamma_{1}= 3(1.2) meV, \Delta_{2}^{0}= 0.5(1.6) meV, and \Gamma_{2}= 3.2(0.9) meV for (a) [(b)]. \Delta_{1}^{0}= 6.4-7.5 meV is noted to be consistent with that of Figs. 1(a) and (b).

Figure 4 shows the T dependence of the gap parameter \Delta(T). For the middle [\approx6-7.5 meV (at 4 K)] gaps, \Delta(T) is obtained from the conductance fitting, while that of the largest (\approx9-10 meV) and smallest (2-2.5 meV) gaps is obtained by either the peak positions or the fittings. All the data converge at single T_{c}\approx 39 K, regardless of the gap size and its low-T behavior. For the largest gap, it almost agrees with the BCS \Delta (T). It is remarkable that the middle size (7.5 meV) gap starts to deviate form the BCS \Delta (T) at \approx20 K, while another middle gap (\approx6 meV) undergoes an almost linear T dependence that is extrapolated to the value close to 7.5 meV at 0 K. The latter feature, which is similar to the PES results,[4] resembles the proximity-induced gap found in the conventional superconductor.[17] The deviation from the BCS curve at high T can also be seen in the smallest 2-2.5 meV gap, but it never exhibits a linear decrease unlike the 6-meV gap. From these facts, at least the middle gap is suggested to arise from a proximity-induced origin.[17]

The largest gap ratio 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}= 5-6 for the \Delta\approx 9-10 meV gap is consistent with the tunneling data by Bugoslavsky _et al.[8]_ and the NMR data,[2] but inconsistent with the other tunneling and PES measurements having a BCS size or less.[3, 4, 5, 6, 7] By adopting the relationship 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c} = 3.5 \{1+12.5(k_{B}T_{c}/E_{\rm ln})^{2}\ln(E_{\rm ln}/2\ k_{B}T_{c})\} for the isotropic, single-band strong-coupling superconductor,[18] the ratio >5 implies the logarithmic average energy of E_{\rm ln}<10-15 meV. This is much lower than E_{\rm ln}\approx58 meV of the inelastic neutron experiment.[19] This discrepancy indicates the difference between the bare phonon density of states and electron-coupled phonon spectrum, which can be related to

  the anisotropic nature of the electron-phonon interaction.[11, 20] Since MgB_{2} possesses multiple Fermi surfaces consisting of boron p_{x,y} and p_{z} bands, different gaps could coexist in the clean limit.[11] Since the p_{x,y} band more strongly contributes to the Fermi-surface state density, a strong electron-phonon interaction and a large energy gap can be in fact realized. It should be noted that the gap ratio 5-6 obtained here coincides well with that of the layered nitride superconductor with T_{c}= 26 K.[21] The above gap ratio does not seems to be a marginal extension of the conventional strong-coupling feature because of no such a large ratio in the superconductors except for copper-oxides.[22]

Among the multiple gap features, the distinct small gap of \Delta = 2-2.5 meV with 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c} = 1.2-1.5 is in fact quite unusual for the reason that the gap ratio should not be less than 3.5 for the simple BCS theory. Nevertheless this feature can be explained by the induced order parameters. Since the tunneling density of states and the T dependence of the gaps are very similar between the two band model and the proximity effect, as already stated, it is difficult to distinguish between them from the spectral fittings.[12, 13] The key feature is the observation of more than two gaps with single T_{c} . This is incompatible with the simple isotropic two-band superconductivity. Assuming the proximity-induced gap, \Delta (T) would undergo a steplike change at the reduced T_{c} , or continue to persist up to bulk T_{c} , depending on the coupling between the surface and the bulk electronic states.[12, 13] In this case, the small \Delta (0) and non-BCS \Delta (T) in Fig. 4 could occur depending on the junction condition. The possible existence of pronounced extrema in the anisotropic gaps, as predicted by the band calculation of the extremely anisotropic Fermi surface, could also be the origin of more than two gaps with a small gap,[11] which, however, remain to be experimentally examined. Concerning the small gap, the PES revealed a small surface-derived band around \Gamma point in the Brillouin zone, which could be connected with the observed small gap.[23]

We further investigate the multi gaps observed here by applying the magnetic field (B), where the superconductivity is suppressed in a different way from the thermal effect.[24] Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show the tunneling conductance at various magnetic fields, which are applied perpendicular to the tunneling currents. The largest single gap is presented in (a), while the two-gap feature is shown in (b). Unfortunately, distinct gap features as in Fig. 1 are not stable when a magnetic field is applied. Therefore, the field dependence is examined with broader gaps, which are usually stable against magnetic fields. Further, we choose the data exhibiting no zero-bias peak [except for the inset of (b)], because such a leakage could cause the excessive local pair breaking owing to the current-induced field near the junction. The gap values in (b) under the fields are obtained by fitting procedures using the weighted sum of the broadened BCS density of states.[25] The apparent shift of the energies of the multigap in the field is demonstrated in the inset of (b). These apparent gap-peak positions are almost consistent with the gap energies determined by the fitting. Since MgB_{2} is a type-II superconductor with the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa\sim 26, the gap in the field probed by break-junction tunneling is assumed to be a specially averaged order parameter in the vortex states.[26] With an increasing field, the gap-edge peak shifts to lower bias accompanying the broadening. Since the Zeemann energy (\sim60 \mueV/T) is much smaller than the gap energy, the observed gap-closing feature is attributed to the

The broken curves represent the fitting results (see the text). Inset: apparent multigap feature under the field. (c) Magnetic-field dependence of the gap value. The broken curves represent \Delta(B) = \Delta(B = 0) [1-B/B_{c}]^{1/2}, (d) The gap-closing field B_{c} vs the zero-field gap value \Delta (B = 0). The broken curve represents B_{c}\approx\Delta^{2}.

  breaking up of cooper pairs in the condensate. In Fig. 5(c), the field dependence of the gap \Delta(B) is plotted up to 8 T with the expression \Delta(B) = \Delta(B = 0)\{1 - B/B_{c}\}^{1/2} for the type-II BCS superconductor (broken curves).[26]B_{c} represents the gap-closing field determined from the above expression. The extrapolations using this expression for the larger gap are done on the basis of the agreement between the experimental data and calculated \Delta(B) for the smaller gap. Therefore, ambiguity remains in determining B_{c} for the larger gap. Nevertheless, here we adopt extrapolated values because their widths apparently decrease as shown in (a), which can be fitted by the above expression of \Delta(B) by choosing the appropriate B_{c}. In Fig. 5(d), B_{c} vs \Delta is plotted from the fitting results in (c) and other data. The errors are mainly owing to different junctions showing the similar gap sizes. This is probably due to either the geometrical difference in the flux penetration or a possible manifestation of the gap anisotropy. The extrapolated value of B_{c}  18-20 T for the \Delta  9 meV gap is comparable to the upper-critical field 20-23 T along the _ab_ plane (parallel to the Mg-B sheets) from the magnetic measurements,[15] thereby indicating that this gap is predominant to MgB_{2}. B_{c} increases with increasing \Delta for \Delta > 5- 6 meV. We can compare the behavior in (d) with the relationship B_{c} = a\Delta(B = 0)^{2}\{a\ \approx 0.21 - 0.28\ \text{T}/(\text{meV})^{2}\} for \Delta > 5- 6 meV using the Ginzburg-Landau theory.[27] The approximate agreement between the above expression and the experimental data indicates that the B_{c} is determined by \Delta (0 K) rather than T_{c}, violating the simple relationship \Delta \proptoT_{c}. From the above coefficient a = 2\,\pi^{3}/\epsilon\,h\upsilon_{F}^{2}, the Fermi velocity is estimated to be v_{F}  2.4-2.8\times10^{5} m/s, which is smaller but roughly consistent with that from the calculation.[28] Further, B_{c} becomes almost independent of \Delta for \Delta < 4 meV. This can be explained by assuming the induced superconducting phase, in which the coherence length for \Delta < 4 meV does not become so large because of the induced small v_{F}. A tiny fraction of the nonsuperconducting phase distributed in the bulk MgB_{2} (Ref. [16]) is also a possible origin, which acts as the magnetic pinning center. It is noted that the value of \Delta \approx 5- 6 meV in the crossover region is close to the BCS value with T_{c} = 39 K. From the above extrapolating procedures, the magnetic field distinguishes the behavior of gaps with the larger \Delta before the larger \Delta above \approx5 meV. This is in contrast to the \Delta(T), where different gap sizes possess the _same_T_{c}. From Fig. 5, the physical properties should exhibit an anomaly at B_{c}\sim 7-13 T for the 2-meV gap. The upper critical field at 0 K along the c axis (perpendicular to the Mg-B sheets) (\sim4-8 T) determined by the magnetic measurements is indeed not so different from the above value, but there is a certain discrepancy between them. This suggests that the 2-meV gap perhaps does not directly reflect the c-axis properties. On the other hand, B_{c} \sim 7-10 T for the \sim5-meV gap is rather close to the above upper-critical field. These facts imply that the different gap values could be classified into larger groups. Apparently, single-crystal measurements in several magnetic-field directions are necessary to find out the exact correlations between the crystallographic direction and the gap size with its suppression field B_{c}.

In summary, break-junction tunneling measurements of MgB_{2} clarify the multigap structures distributing \Delta  2-10 meV with 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c} = 1.2-6. The conductance features agree with the correlated two-gap model. The observed small gap as well as the non-BCS \Delta(T) is consistent with the behavior of induced order parameters. The magnetic field reveals a higher extrapolated gap-closing field B_{c} for the larger gap for \Delta > 5 meV, but B_{c} becomes almost independent of \Delta below 5 meV. The B_{c} for the largest gap \Delta \approx 10 meV almost agrees with the upper-critical field along the Mg-B sheets. Therefore, this gap can be predominant to MgB_{2}. The largest ratio 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c} = 5-6 well exceeds the largest strong-coupling ratio (\sim4.3) for the conventional inter-metallic superconductors, which deserves to study further. After finishing this work, we have found a similar conductance fitting for the induced (smaller) gap \Delta_{2} at low temperature.[29]
