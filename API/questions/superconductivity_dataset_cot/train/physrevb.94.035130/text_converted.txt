###### Abstract

Recent findings of possible topological superconductivity in YPtBi
motivated us to grow and investigate single crystals of this material.
The compound was studied by means of ac magnetic susceptibility,
electrical resistivity, Hall resistivity, and heat capacity
measurements, performed in wide ranges of temperature and magnetic
field. The superconductivity below the critical temperature T_(c) = 0.97
K was clearly reflected in the magnetic and electronic transport data.
The upper critical field B_(c2) was estimated at 1.84 T. However, no
obvious anomaly near T_(c) was found in the temperature dependence of
the heat capacity. In the normal state YPtBi appears semimetallic but
its electrical conductance can be described by two components
corresponding to parallel channels: metallic and semiconducting, with
the latter becoming negligible at temperatures below 40 K. Shubnikov-de
Haas oscillations were observed at temperatures below 10 K. Nontrivial
Berry phase together with weak antilocalization effect strongly support
the presence of Dirac fermions in YPtBi.

## I Introduction

The ternary bismuthide YPtBi belongs to the outstanding class of
intermetallic materials, crystallizing in MgAgAs-type structure, known
as half-Heusler phases [1]. Since the late 1990s half-Heusler compounds
gained profound interest as new multifunctional materials for spintronic
and thermoelectric applications [2]. In the course of time, new
properties and putative fields of applications appeared continuously.
Recent discoveries of topological properties revive the interest in the
half-Heusler phases containing heavy elements. Several research groups
have independently predicted theoretically a 3D topological insulator
state (TI) in some of these compounds [3, 4, 5, 6]. Furthermore, some
representatives of half-Heusler family are low-temperature
superconductors, YPtBi among them [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Due
to its noncentrosymmetric crystal structure YPtBi might be an
unconventional superconductor with mixed spin-singlet/spin-triplet
pairing. Based on the results of first principles calculations of the
electron-phonon coupling in YPtBi, it has recently been concluded that
the mechanism of pairing in YPtBi is indeed unconventional [16].
Besides, combination of nontrivial 3D topology and superconductivity
makes YPtBi one of the leading candidates for realizing topological
superconducting state.

TIs have gapless conducting surface states protected from backscattering
by time-reversal symmetry. Nevertheless, surface states of a
superconducting TI may host Majorana fermions [17], which spark
considerable interest because of their potential application in building
a fault-tolerant quantum computer [18]. Immediately after discovery of
superconductivity in copper doped Bi₂Se₃[19], Fu and Berg theoretically
predicted that Cu_(x)Bi₂Se₃ could be a topological superconductor (TSC)
[20]. The observation of topological order together with
superconductivity in that compound [21] has given a powerful impetus to
the intensive development in the field of TSCs. In addition to
Cu_(x)Bi₂Se₃ and a group of a half-Heusler phases, several other
compounds were proposed as putative TSCs, usually doped topological
crystalline insulators [22, 23] or doped-TI heterostructures [24, 25].

YPtBi has hitherto been investigated thoroughly in view of the
superconductivity, occurring below critical temperature, T_(c) = 0.77 K
[7, 8, 9], whereas a possible topological nontriviality of its
electronic state was studied to a much lesser degree [7, 26]. Therefore,
the main goal of the present work was to gather evidence in support of
nontrivial topology of the electronic structure in YPtBi. There are
several experimental methods for verification of topological
nontriviality, with the most straightforward being surface-sensitive
probes, such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning
tunneling spectroscopy, which in the case of half-Heusler phases are
hampered by strong difficulties with preparation of clean surface [27].
Recently, nuclear magnetic resonance has been suggested to be a simple
technique probing band inversion in half-Heusler bismuthides, among them
YPtBi, a necessary condition for realizing nontrivial topology [26, 28].
In this paper, we focused our attention on the magnetotransport
properties of single-crystalline YPtBi, expected to provide further
fingerprints of its nontrivial topological nature [29].

## II Experimental Details

Single crystals of YPtBi were grown from Bi flux with the starting
atomic composition Y:Pt:Bi of 1:1:9. First, binary equiatomic compound
YBi was prepared by arc melting. Then, it was crushed, mixed with small
pieces of Pt wires and Bi grains, put in an alumina crucible, and sealed
in an evacuated quartz ampule. The ampule was heated slowly to 1130 degC
and kept for 12 h, then slowly cooled down to 925 degC at 3 degC/h and
kept for 12 h. Afterwards, the cooling continued at 1 degC/h rate down
to 550 degC, and at that temperature the ampule was taken out from the
furnace. The excess of Bi flux was removed by etching with diluted
nitric acid. The obtained single crystals had shapes of truncated
pyramids with the dimensions up to 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.8 mm³.

Several single crystals were powdered and x-ray diffraction at room
temperature was used to verify the $F\bar{4}3m$ space group and to
determine the lattice parameter of 6.65 A, using an X’-pert Pro
PANanalytical diffractometer with Cu-_K_a radiation.

Chemical composition of the obtained YPtBi single crystals was studied
on a FEI scanning electron microscope equipped with an EDAX Genesis XM4
spectrometer. The crystals were found homogeneous with Y:Pt:Bi ratio of
28.3:38:33.7, within experimental error of ±3

ac magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed on a collection
of small YPtBi single crystals with the total mass of 167 mg. These
experiments were carried out in the temperature interval 0.45-2.0 K
using a Quantum Design MPMS-XL SQUID magnetometer with an iHelium3
refrigerator.

For electrical transport studies, specimens of bar and platelet shapes
were cut from two single crystals and then polished. Dimensions of
samples were 0.20×0.29×1.2 mm³ for resistivity measurements and
0.15×0.44×1.6 mm³ for Hall resistivity measurements. Standard ac
four-probe method was used for these two experiments with electrical
leads made of 50-_m_m-diameter silver wire spot-welded to the samples
and additionally fixed with silver paste. The experiments were conducted
in the temperature range 0.4-300 K and in applied magnetic fields up to
9 T using a Quantum Design PPMS platform with a ³He refrigerator. In
magnetoresistance measurements electric current was flowing along [1 0
0] and the field applied in [0 0 1] crystallographic direction, whereas
in the Hall resistivity measurements the current direction was [1 1 0]
and the field direction was [1 1 1].

Heat capacity measurements were carried out within the temperature range
0.4-20 K on a 46.5 mg collection of YPtBi single crystals using a
relaxation method implemented into the PPMS platform.

## III Results and Discussion

### Magnetic susceptibility

Low-temperature dependencies of the real, χ_(ac)^(′), and imaginary,
χ_(ac)^(′′), components of the ac magnetic susceptibility of YPtBi are
depicted in Fig. 1(a). Abrupt drop of χ_(ac)^(′′) clearly indicates a
superconducting phase transition at T_(c) = 0.86 K, which agrees with
the values reported in the literature [7, 8, 9]. The χ_(ac)^(′′)
component does not saturate down to the lowest available temperature of
0.45 K, at which only the 54

### Electrical transport

Figure 1(b) represents the temperature variation of the electrical
resistivity of single-crystalline YPtBi. The shape of ρ(T) reflects a
semiconducting character of our sample. On cooling below 300 K, the
resistivity gradually increases, indicating the presence of a band gap,
and levels off below 70 K. The value of ρ at 300 K is 0.52 mΩ cm, and at
2 K it is 0.88 mΩ cm. In general, as regards both the magnitude of the
resistivity and its temperature variation, our single crystals resemble
those studied by Butch _et al._[7]. In contrast, Bay _et al._ observed a
metallic behavior of their single crystals in the

entire temperature range covered [8], while the polycrystalline samples
investigated by Shekhar _et al._ showed ρ(T) with well pronounced broad
maximum near 120 K [30].

A sharp drop in the resistivity at low temperatures signals the onset of
the superconducting state. The critical temperature, defined as a point
in which resistivity drops to 50

The low-temperature resistivity of YPtBi, measured in various external
magnetic fields up to 2 T, is shown in the inset to Fig. 1(b). With
increasing the field strength, the superconducting transition shifts to
lower temperatures. The value of upper critical field, B_(c2) = 0.9 T,
at our lowest temperature of 0.4 K is slightly larger than 0.75 T
presented in Ref. [7]. Rough extrapolation of our data to T = 0 yielded
B_(c2)(0) ≈ 1.6 T.

The superconducting coherence length, ξ₀, in YPtBi can be calculated
from the formula $\xi_{0}=\sqrt{\Phi_{0}/2\pi}\,B_{\text{c2}}(0)$, where
Φ₀ is the flux quantum. The so-obtained value ξ₀ = 14 nm is very similar
to those reported in Refs. [7, 8]. Under assumption that Fermi surface
(FS) is spherical, the Fermi wave number, k_(F), can be determined as
k_(F) = (3π²n)^(1/3), where n is the carrier concentration. Setting
n = n_(H) = 5.6 × 10¹⁸ cm⁻³ from the Hall effect data (see below) one
obtains k_(F) = 5.5 × 10⁶ cm⁻¹. Then, with the residual resistivity
ρ₀ = 0.88 mΩ cm, one finds the mean free path l = ℏk_(F)/ρ₀ne² = 67 nm.
The latter value is significantly larger than ξ₀, which provides further
proof that the superconductivity in YPtBi occurs in the clean limit.
Pauli limiting field, B_(P), can be calculated from the expression
$B_{\text{P}}=\Delta/\sqrt{2}\mu_{B}$, where Δ = 1.76 k_(B)T_(c) is the
BCS energy gap. The so-derived B_(P) = 1.8 T is close to B_(c2), which
implies that the superconductivity in YPtBi is Pauli limited.

As shown in Fig. 1(c), the overall behavior of the electrical
conductivity, σ(T), of YPtBi can be well approximated by the two-channel
charge transport model, recently applied to describe the σ(T) dependence
in LuPdBi [14]. The conductivity is assumed to be a sum of contributions
from two independent channels: metallic- and semiconductinglike. For the
metallic channel it is described by σ_(m)(T) = 1/(ρ₀ + bT²), where ρ₀ is
the residual resistivity due to scattering on structural defects, while
the second term represents electron-electron scattering processes. In
turn, the semiconducting channel contributes with
σ_(s)(T) = 1/(a exp (−E_(g)/k_(B)T)), where E_(g) is an energy gap
between valence and conduction bands. Fitting σ(T) = σ_(m)(T) + σ_(s)(T)
to the experimental data of YPtBi, in the temperature range 2-300 K,
yielded the following parameters: a = 217 mΩ cm, E_(g) = 38.8 meV, and
b = 2.3 mΩ cm/K². The E_(g) value is about four times larger than 11.5
meV found for LuPdBi in Ref. [14], thus indicating that YPtBi is more
"bulk-insulating" material than LuPdBi. Furthermore, it is worth noting
that below 40 K, conductivity of the semiconductinglike channel becomes
negligible and the electric current essentially flows through the
metalliclike channel. For LuPdBi the analogous cutoff temperature was
twice lower [14].

### Hall effect and magnetoresistance

The results of Hall effect measurements are shown in Fig. 2(a). Positive
Hall resistivity in positive magnetic field confirms hole-type
conductivity, reported in Ref. [7]. However, ρ_(xy)(B) is not linear in
the whole range of magnetic field. At T = 2 K, a very weak change of its
slope occurs around magnetic field of 1 T, with temperature increasing
this characteristic magnetic field also grows to 4.5 and 6 T, at 100 and
300 K, respectively. Such behavior indicates multiband electronic
structure in YPtBi. We tried to fit the two-band

Figure 2: (a) Hall resistivity of single-crystalline YPtBi as a function
of magnetic field measured at several temperatures in the range 2–300 K.
In fields stronger than 5 T and temperatures below 10 K clear
oscillations of ρ_(xy) appear. b),c) Temperature dependence of the
carrier concentration and the Hall mobility, respectively. Solid lines
are guides for the eye. (d) Magnetoresistance of YPtBi as a function of
magnetic field, measured at T = 4 K. Lower inset: sheet conductance of
YPtBi at T = 4 K versus magnetic field. The red solid line represents

model to our data, but attempts were futile, since the fits yielded
parameters, which were very strongly dependent on each other. Most
likely it was due to relatively small difference in mobilities of holes
and electrons, which also brought almost linear behavior of ρ_(xy)(B).
Thus we used the single-carrier Drude model and from values of ρ_(xy)
taken at magnetic field 9 T calculated carrier concentrations, n_(H),
and mobilities, μ, for YPtBi. We keep in mind that obtained in such way
values of n_(H) should be interpreted with caution and provide only
lower limit of actual concentration, due to the multiband character of
the compound.

The temperature dependence of n_(H) in YPtBi is shown in Fig. 2(b). In
the temperature range from 2 to 50 K, n_(H) hardly changes and equals
≈5.6×10¹⁸ cm⁻³. Above 50 K, the carrier concentration begins to
increase, and attains 3.4×10²⁰ cm⁻³ at room temperature. This behavior
of n_(H)(T) resembles that described by Butch _et al._ with a difference
in the magnitudes, as they estimated n_(H) = 2 × 10¹⁸ cm⁻³ at 2 K and a
tenfold increased value at 300 K [7]. On the other hand, Ref. [30]
reported n_(H) = 6.8×10¹⁸ cm⁻³ at low temperatures, which only tripled
at 300 K. Such big differences in values of n_(H) seem to be caused by
sample- and temperature-dependent contributions of different bands in
total conductivity.

Remarkably, the carrier concentration in YPtBi at low temperatures is at
least three orders of magnitude smaller than its theoretically estimated
lower limit necessary for conventional pairing superconductivity in this
compound [16]. This finding is in line with the odd-parity character of
the superconducting state in YPtBi, suggested by Bay _et al._[8]. Figure
2(c) displays the temperature variation of the Hall mobility, μ, in
YPtBi. The value observed at 300 K is μ = 40 cm²V⁻¹s⁻¹, whilst those
below 50 K are ≈1100 cm²V⁻¹s⁻¹.

It is interesting to compare our results to Hall concentration and
mobility very recently reported for the heavy-lanthanides-bearing
_R_PtBi series (R= Gd, Dy, Tm, and Lu) and plotted against the lattice
parameter [31]. At 300 K our values n_(H) = 3.4 × 10²⁰ cm⁻³ and μ = 40
cm²V⁻¹s⁻¹, place YPtBi property between GdPtBi (n_(H) = 5.5×10¹⁹ cm⁻³,
μ ∼ 260 cm²V⁻¹s⁻¹) and TmPtBi (n_(H) ∼ 10²¹ cm⁻³, μ ∼ 3 cm²V⁻¹s⁻¹),
which corroborates the conclusion of Ref. [3] that "the trend along the
series is steric rather than magnetic in origin". Values of Hall
coefficient we measured at 300 K, ρ_(xy)/B ∼ 0.1 nΩ cm/Oe, resemble most
closely those of TmPtBi (cf. Fig. 9c of Ref. [31]).

Figure 2(d) depicts the results of magnetoresistance (_MR_) measurements
of YPtBi at temperatures 0.4 K and 4 K, in magnetic fields up to 9 T and
14 T, respectively. At T = 0.4 K a behavior typical for a
superconducting material is observed [see the upper inset to Fig. 2(d)].
At 4 K _MR_ first rapidly increases with increasing field, showing a
concave curvature, but then it becomes nearly linear up to the strongest
fields achievable [cf. the main panel of Fig. 2(d)]. _MR_ reaches 205

The shape of _MR_(_B_) in weak magnetic fields has already been
considered for YPtBi in terms of the weak antilocalization (WAL) effect
[7,30], evidenced also in several TIs [32,33,34]. Following that
approach we fitted magneto-conductance with the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka
[34] function,
$\frac{\eta^{2}}{2\pi^{2}}[\Psi\{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\hbar}{4\ell_{c}^{2}B}\}- \ln(\frac{\hbar}{4\ell_{c}^{2}B})]$,
where η is a prefactor depending on the strength of spin-orbit coupling
and on the type of localization, L_(φ) is a phase coherence length, and
ψ(x) is a digamma function. The fit, depicted in the lower inset to Fig.
2(d), was of good quality and yielded L_(φ) = 97 nm and η = −1.9×10⁵.
Comparable values of L_(φ) and η were found previously for YPtBi,
LuPdBi, and HoPdBi [7,14,15,30]. Similar magnitudes of the prefactor η,
several orders larger than expected for purely 2D TI states, were
already reported for YPtBi, LuPtBi, LuPdBi, and LuPtSb [7,12,30,35] and
rationalized by assuming bulk or sidewall channels of electron transport
[36].

### Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations

In addition to WAL and nonsaturating linear _MR_, we observed for our
single crystals of YPtBi another fingerprint of possible TI states,
namely Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations. At temperatures up to 10 K,
both the electrical resistivity and the Hall resistivity were found to
oscillate in high magnetic fields. Quantum oscillations of the
resistivity of single-crystalline YPtBi have already been observed by
Butch _et al._, who determined the effective cyclotron mass,
m^(*) = 0.15m_(e) (m_(e) is the free electron mass), the oscillation
frequency 46 T and estimated, within spherical FS approximation, the
carrier concentration of 1.7×10¹⁸ cm⁻³ (cf. Ref. [7]). Interestingly,
they have noticed also a node at 0.12 T⁻¹, due to beating, and
attributed this effect to spin-orbit splitting of the Fermi surface and
shifts in phase of the oscillations.

Figure 3(a) represents the SdH oscillations of the Hall resistivity of
YPtBi, visualized upon subtracting from the measured data a linear
component [cf. Fig. 2(a)]. No sign of FS splitting is seen. The
temperature dependence of the Hall resistivity oscillations amplitude
can be expressed as Δρ_(xy) ∝ λ(T)/sinh (λ(T)), where
λ(T) = 2π²k_(B)Tm^(*)/(ℏeB)[37]. Fitting this equation to the
experimental data of YPtBi [see Fig. 3(b)] yielded m^(*) = 0.22m_(e),
which is only slightly larger than the value reported before [7].

The oscillating component Δρ_(xy) was analyzed [see the upper inset to
Fig. 3(a)] in terms of the standard Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) expression:

$$\Delta\rho_{xy}\propto\exp^{-\lambda_{D}}\lambda_{T}\sqrt{1/B}\cos(2\pi(F/B+ \beta+1/2)),$$
(1)

where λ_(D) = 2π²k_(B)T_(D)m^(*)/(ℏeB), F stands for the oscillation
frequency, T_(D) is the Dingle temperature, β is the phase shift that
directly corresponds to the Berry phase, and
λ_(T) = λ(T)/sinh (λ(T))[37]. With m^(*) fixed at 0.22m_(e) the LK
formula was fit to the experimental data of YPtBi, which yielded
T_(D) = 5.1(2) K, F = 24.7(1) T, β = 0.35(1), and the Berry phase 0.7π
at 1.85 K. The oscillation frequency was found temperature independent.
Another way in which the Dingle temperature could be obtained is the
so-called Dingle analysis, depicted in the inset to Fig. 3(b). The value
of T_(D) derived from the slope of the linear fit amounts to 6.45 K,
being thus fairly similar to that obtained from the LK function fitting.
Knowing T_(D) allows estimating the surface scattering time
τ_(s) = ℏ/(2πk_(B)T_(D)) = 1.88 × 10⁻¹³ s. It is worth noting that the
transport scattering time evaluated from the Hall carrier concentration
τ_(r) = m^(*)/(e²n_(H)ρ) = 1.58 × 10⁻¹³ s is nearly identical to τ_(r).
The value of the scattering time derived for our single crystals is
almost twice larger than that reported by Butch _et al._[7]. Assuming
circular cross section of the Fermi surface one obtains from the
Onsager’s relation [37], the Fermi wave vector
$k_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{SdH}}=\sqrt{2\pi eF/\hbar}=2.74\times 10^{6}$
cm⁻¹, which corresponds to the 2D carrier density n_(2D) = 6 × 10¹¹
cm⁻². Other parameters which can be derived are the Fermi velocity
v_(F) = ℏk_(F)^(SdH)/m^(*) ≈ 1.4 × 10⁵ ms⁻¹, the Fermi energy
E_(F) = m^(*)v_(F)²/2 ≈ 12.8 meV, the mean-free path
I_(5dH) = v_(F)τ_(s) = 26.8 nm, and the carrier mobility
μ_(s) = eτ_(s)/m^(*) = eℓ/ℏk_(F)^(SdH) = 1486 cm²V⁻¹s⁻¹. Comparison of
the parameters obtained from the SdH oscillations analysis, especially
τ_(s) and μ_(s), and those derived from the Hall data at the lowest
temperatures, especially τ_(r) and μ, shows their very good agreement.

We examined also angular dependence of ρ_(xy)(B⁻¹) oscillations. When
the field was tilted from [111] towards [001] direction by an angle θ
the SdH frequency increased as ≈1/cosθ. At θ ≈ 55^(∘) (i.e., the field
along [001]) F reached maximum value of 42 T and started to decrease
upon further rotation. This maximum value is very close to 46 T reported
by Butch _et al._[7]. In turn, our analysis of the SdH oscillations in
the transverse _MR_ in field applied along [001] [see Fig. 2(d)] yielded
F = 49 T. The observed angle dependence of the SdH frequency may be
explained assuming the presence of strongly elongated electron FS
pockets of cigarlike shape located between Γ and L points of Brillouin
zone, with their axes along ⟨11 1⟩ directions. The cross section of such
FS pocket changes as ≈1/cosθ when the field is tilted from its axis by
θ[38], but when the field passes the [001] direction the SdH signal from
another pocket of the same type takes over and F starts decreasing.

Our experimental findings are consistent with the electronic structure
calculations performed by Meinert [16], while contradicting those
reported in Refs. [5, 6]. Nevertheless, Meinert’s results also show band
inversion and do not exclude topologically nontrivial states. Thus we
may hypothesize that at low temperatures the electrical current flows in
single-crystalline YPtBi almost only due to metallic surface states and
the bulk of material is nearly completely insulating. The observation of
two-channel conductivity in YPtBi [see Fig. 1(c)] strengthens this
conjecture, and expands its validity to higher temperatures, at least up
to 40 K.

Strong support for the nontrivial topology of YPtBi band structure,
arising directly from the analysis of the SdH oscillations, is nonzero
Berry phase. The Berry phase can be also determined employing a Landau
level (LL) index analysis. First, following the discussion on proper
construction of the LL index plot [29], the Hall conductance
G_(xy) = R_(xy)/(R_(xy)² + R_(xx)²) at T = 1.85 K was derived. Next,
positions of the extrema in G_(xy)(1/B) were identified by
differentiating this function. The maxima in dG_(xy)/d(1/B) were labeled
by integer numbers, while the minima by half-integer numbers,
appropriately for a system with dominant hole-charge carriers [39]. As
can be inferred from the lower inset to Fig. 3(a), a linear fit to the
LL index data yielded an intercept of 0.43, which corresponds to the
0.86π Berry phase. Though there is a little difference between the
latter value and 0.7π obtained from the LK analysis, both are nontrivial
being much closer to the theoretical value of π characteristic of Dirac
fermions than to zero expected for Schrodinger fermions. Slightly
reduced Berry phase with respect to the theoretical one may arise due to
Zeeman coupling and/or small deviation from the ideal linear dispersion
of Dirac fermions [40]. Analysis of weaker SdH oscillations of ρ_(xz) at
0.4 K [upper inset of Fig. 2(d)] also resulted in nontrivial Berry phase
of 0.96π [cf. lower inset to Fig. 3(a)].

### Heat capacity

Figure 4 shows the low-temperature dependence of specific heat capacity,
C, measured in zero magnetic field. Our results at higher temperatures
are fairly close to those published in literature: at 20 K we measured 6
J/mol K, while Ref. [41] reported 6.6 J/mol K (at 10 K: 1 J/mol K and
0.9 J/mol K, respectively). At lower temperatures we observed
discrepancies with Ref. [41], indicating again that the electronic
structure of YPtBi is strongly sample dependent.

Figure 3: (a) Shubnikov–de Haas (SdH) oscillations of ρ_(xy) measured at
1.85, 4, 6, and 10 K. Upper inset: SdH oscillations at T = 1.85 K. The
solid line represents the LK fit discussed in the text [Eq. (1)]. Lower

LL data (circles for ρ_(xy), squares for ρ_(xz)) have the intercepts
indicated by arrows. (b) Temperature dependence of the SdH amplitude
observed in a magnetic field of 8 T. The solid line is the LK fit (see
the text). Inset: Dingle plot for the oscillations measured at 1.85 K.
Solid line represents linear fit determining the Dingle temperature (see
the text).

Observed behavior of C(T) cannot be described by standard model for
nonmagnetic metal. As emphasized in the inset of Fig. 4, C/T shows a
distinct increase of C/T below 0.8 K. This effect can be attributed to
nuclear contribution. Here both bismuth and yttrium can be responsible
for this effect in YPtBi, due to rather big values of nuclear quadrupole
moment. Contribution of the nuclear Schottky effect may be approximated
as [42]C_(Sch) ∝ T⁻². We thus fitted our experimental data with equation

C(T) = γ T + β T³ + δT⁻²,
(2)

where γ is the Sommerfeld electronic heat capacity coefficient and β is
Debye lattice heat capacity coefficient. The fit is represented by the
solid blue lines in Fig. 4. Analyzing the experimental data in terms of
this formula we evaluated the following parameters: γ = 0.69 mJ/mol K²,
β = 0.53 mJ/mol K⁴, and δ = 0.052 mJ K/mol.

From the value of β one finds the Debye temperature,
Θ_(D) = (36R_(g)π⁴/5β)^(1/3) = 222 K, where R_(g) is the gas constant.
We note that the our γ is much bigger than 0.1 mJ/mol K² reported by
Pagliuso _et al._[41] but they analyzed data collected at a
significantly higher temperature range: 1.5-3.5 K. When we analyzed our
data in the same temperature interval we got γ = 0.4 mJ/mol K², which is
still bigger than that obtained in Ref. [41].

Similar to LuPtBi, LuPdBi, and several antiferromagnetically ordered,
superconducting half-Heusler phases, including HoPdBi (Refs. [14, 15,
43, 44]), no anomaly in specific heat capacity is visible at the
superconducting phase transition. Moreover, knowing the values of
effective mass and Fermi wave vector derived from SdH oscillations and
assuming that YPtBi has 3D spherical Fermi surface we calculated the
Sommerfeld coefficient: γ = k_(B)²Vm^(*)k_(F)/3ℏ² = 0.014 mJ/mol K², a
value nearly 50 times smaller than that derived from C(T) analysis.

## IV Conclusions

We confirmed the superconductivity of YPtBi single crystals with
characteristic values of T_(c) = 0.97 K and B_(c2) ≈ 1.6 T, being fairly
similar to previously reported [7, 8, 9]. Lack of anomaly near the onset
of superconductivity on the temperature dependence of specific heat
capacity is remarkable, because it might reflect the superconductivity
of surface states which occupy only the small fraction of the whole
sample volume.

Magnetoresistance of YPtBi has several features typical for
topologically nontrivial materials: (i) at low magnetic fields a sharp
increase consistent with WAL effect, (ii) linear and nonsaturating
behavior in high magnetic fields and wide range of temperatures, and
(iii) quantum oscillations in magnetic field.

The analysis of SdH oscillations brought us some insight into the Dirac
fermion nature of carriers in YPtBi. Small value of effective mass and
nonzero Berry phase are common features of Dirac systems with linear
energy dispersion. We determined the Berry phase in two different ways,
from the fitting Lifshitz-Kosevich formula to experimental data and with
the help of Landau index plot–in both cases Berry phase is nonzero and
very close to theoretical π value for Dirac fermion.

Comparison of Sommerfeld coefficients derived from specific heat and
quantum oscillation results suggests that SdH oscillations come from the
electrons that occupy the Fermi surface much smaller than the one which
brings out the observed specific heat capacity. Thus SdH oscillations
seem to originate from a 2D Fermi surface (formed by Dirac fermions) or
from small pockets of 3D Fermi surface (like those elongated electron
pockets predicted by Meinert’s calculations [16]). These two possible
sources of SdH oscillations do not exclude each other. Dirac cone always
forms around inverted 3D bands, and when topological gap is below or
above the Fermi level, a cross section of that Dirac cone consisting of
2D surface states envelops closely a pocket of 3D Fermi surface.
Frequencies and angular dependence of SdH oscillations corresponding to
these 2D and 3D states may be very similar, making it difficult to
distinguish 2D surface states from anisotropic 3D pockets. This obstacle
seems to be present also in the case of YPtBi; however, the Berry phase
points strongly in favor of Dirac states.

Our results on electronic properties revealed several characteristics of
nontrivial topology nature in YPtBi single crystals. But the final
confirmation of such unusual properties must be sought via additional
spectroscopic investigation. A report on photoemission study of YPtBi
has been posted [45].
