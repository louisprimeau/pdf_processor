###### Abstract

We have studied the mixed-state Hall effect of the high-T_{c} superconductors Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4} (NCCO), Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8} (Tl2212), and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (YBCO), and the isotropic low-T_{c} superconductor amorphous Mo_{3}Si (_a_-Mo_{3}Si). We demonstrate the pinning independence of the Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy} and its consequent scaling in terms of the anisotropy of NCCO, Tl2212, and YBCO. In YBCO and _a_-Mo_{3}Si the Hall angle is enhanced as we reduce the effective pinning, yet \sigma_{xy} is unchanged. For all of these materials there is a vortex contribution \sigma_{xy}\sim1/H at low fields while at high fields \sigma_{xy}\simH. These results provide evidence that beneath the effects of pinning and anisotropy a relatively simple and universal behavior of the mixed-state Hall effect exists.

The transport properties of superconductors in the vortex state, though widely studied, still present many puzzles. In particular, a wide range of both high-T_{c} and low-T_{c} materials show a sign change of the Hall effect below T_{c}.[1] In the mixed state, vortices moving with velocity **v** generate a spatially averaged electric field according to Josephson's relation \textbf{E}\!=\!-\textbf{v}\!\times\!\textbf{B}.[2] When the flux lines are pinned a transport current flows around the vortices with no energy loss (\textbf{E}\!=\!\textbf{0}). However, when the vortices move current passes through the vortex core, dissipating energy and generating a Hall voltage. In the simplest models this leads to a mixed-state Hall effect of the same sign as in the normal state.[34]

A difficulty in developing a model of the mixed-state Hall effect, in addition to predicting a sign change, is that a wide variety of temperature and field dependences have been reported,[1] at least partly due to the range of pinning strengths and anisotropy in these materials. In fact, recent models have suggested the sign change is related to the specific properties of flux pinning[5] or layered structures.[6, 7] In this report, we account for anisotropy and demonstrate that the Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy} is _independent of pinning_, strongly suggesting that neither pinning nor anisotropic structures are the origin of the sign anomaly. In addition, the Hall conductivity for a variety of superconductors, both anisotropic high T_{c} and isotropic low T_{c}, has a contribution \sigma_{xy}\!\sim\!1/H which is presumably intrinsic to vortex dynamics.[4, 8, 9]

We measure the longitudinal voltage V_{xx} and the Hall voltage V_{xy} with the transport current in the _ab_ plane perpendicular to the magnetic field (up to 9 T). The magnetic field is ramped from high to low fields at both polarities with the temperature fixed; V_{xy} is the component of the transverse voltage odd in applied field. The sample mount has a rotating stage for changing the field direction, a magnetic-field-insensitive Cernox metal film thermometer, and a carbon glass thermometer with a calibration in magnetic field. The Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8} (Tl2212) sample is a _c_-axis oriented 5000-A-thick film prepared by laser ablation from a single target followed by post-deposition heat processing with T_{c}\!\equiv104 K and j_{c}\!\approx\!10^{6}A/cm^{2} at 77 K. The Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4} (NCCO) measurements were made on a _c_-axis oriented 20-\mum-thick single crystal with T_{c}\!\equiv\!24 K (details of the preparation are given in Ref. [10]). The YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (YBCO) measurements were made on a _c_-axis oriented 1000-A-thick film grown by pulsed laser ablation with T_{c}\!\equiv\!92 K. The amorphous Mo_{3}Si (_a_-Mo_{3}Si) sample is an isotropic amorphous film of 250-A thickness with T_{c}\!\equiv\!7.5 K; details of the sample preparation and characterization are given in Refs. [11] and [12].

An interesting way to vary the transport properties of anisotropic materials is to change the magnetic field direction.[13] For our measurements we rotate the sample, varying the angle \theta between the c axis and the field, while keeping the current and field perpendicular to each other. In Fig. 1(a) we show the in-plane longitudinal resistivity, \rho_{xx} vs H, measured on our NCCO single crystal at T\!=\!16 K for \theta\!=\!0^{\circ}, 30^{\circ}, 50^{\circ}, and 70^{\circ}. As \theta increases the \rho_{xx} vs H transitions move out to higher fields, reflecting the increase in H_{c2} as the field is directed into the _ab_ plane. The effective mass anisotropy ratio is defined as \Gamma\!=\!m_{c}/m_{ab}\!=\!(H_{c2}^{\dagger}/H_{c2}^{\dagger})^{2}\!=\!\xi_{ab} ^{2}/\xi_{c2}^{2}\!\approx\!10^{3} for NCCO,[14] where H_{c2}^{\dagger} (\propto\!1/\xi_{ab}\xi_{c}) and H_{c2}^{\dagger} (\propto\!1/\xi_{ab}^{2}) correspond to H_{c2} with the field applied parallel and perpendicular to the _ab_ plane, respectively. In Fig. 1(b) we plot \rho_{xx} vs H\cos\theta. The data for all \theta collapse very nicely to a single curve, indicating that only the field component parallel to the c axis (H\cos\theta) is contributing to the dissipation. We have observed the scaling of \rho_{xx} with H\cos\theta from T\!=\!19 K down to T\!=\!4 K, which is the temperature range of our measurements. We have not pursued the high angle regime, \theta\!\to\!90^{\circ}, where various two-dimensional[15] (2D) and anisotropic 3D models[16, 17] are distinguishable, as done on Bi2212,[18] for example. Our primary interest is to point out that the field component along the c axis is dictating the vortex dynamics.

Also shown in Fig. 1(b) is the Hall resistivity \rho_{xy} vs H\cos\theta for T\!=\!16 K. The scaling with H\cos\theta indicates that the in-plane Hall effect, and in particular the sign anomaly, arises strictly from vortex segments aligned parallel to the c axis. In the normal state \rho_{xy} scales with H\cos\theta for all materials, whereas in the mixed state of a superconductor this simple scaling form is only expected to hold in the large anisotropy limit.[16, 17] In the limit of large anisotropy (and \theta not too near 90^{\circ}), 3D anisotropic-mass models predict F_{ij}(H,\theta)\!=\!F_{ij}(H\cos\theta), where F is a transport quantity such as resistivity \rho or conductivity \sigma and ij\!=\!xx or ij\!=\!xy.

As can be seen in Fig. 1, both \rho_{xx} and \rho_{xy} become imeasantly small below a minimum field \mu_{\rm o}H_{\rm min}\!\approx\!\frac{1}{2} T due to flux pinning. To observe free-flux flow at low currents it is necessary to go into a regime where the pinning potential is weak (H\!\!\approx\!\!H_{\rm min}). However, H_{\rm min}(T) is the same order of magnitude as H_{\rm c2}(T), even in relatively low-pinning materials. High-current densities can be used to suppress pinning,[12, 19] but it is difficult to increase the current density without heating in single crystals. An alternative is to measure a pinning-independent quantity, such as predicted for \sigma_{xy},[20, 21] which still elucidates the essential physics.

In Fig. 2(a) we report the data from Fig. 1 as \sigma_{xy} vs H_{\rm z} (\sigma_{xy} vs H\cos\theta), where \sigma_{xy}\!=\!\rho_{xy}/(\rho_{xx}^{2}\!+\!\rho_{xy}^{2}). The dashed curve is a fit to \sigma_{xy}\!=\!c_{1}/H_{z}\!+\!c_{2}H_{x}, yielding \sigma_{xy}\!=\!95 (T/\Omega cm)/\mu_{\rm o}H_{z}\!-\!40 (1/T \Omega cm)\mu_{\rm o}H_{z}. The linear contribution to \sigma_{xy} has the same sign and field dependence as the normal-state Hall conductivity. The coefficient of the 1/H term is opposite in sign to the normal state, thus this term leads to a sign reversal. Several models predict a vortex contribution to the Hall conductivity of the form \sigma_{xy}\!\sim\!1/B,[4, 8, 9] we note in our experiments B\!\cong\!\mu_{\rm o}H. Nozieres and Vinen[4] suggest this form, but with a coefficient of the same sign as in the normal state. Based on time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) theory, Dorsey[8] and Kopnin[9] argue that for H\!\!\!\ll\!\!H_{c2}\sigma_{xy}\!\!\sim\!\!1/B, as flux flow dominates the conductivity, and allow a sign change depending on electronic structure. They go on to argue that near H_{\rm c2} the conductivity is the normal-state conductivity plus a correction due to vortex motion which decreases as H_{c2}\!-\!B.[8, 9] A convenient way to interpolate between the low- and high-field regimes is to write \sigma_{xy}\!=\!c_{1}/B\!+\!c_{2}B, which models our data reasonably well, but we note that this additive form for \sigma_{xy} is not a consequence of TDGL theory.

We observe similar results for Tl2212 [\Gamma\!\!\sim\!\!10^{4} (Ref. [22]) both in the angular dependence as well as the field dependence of the Hall conductivity. Displayed in Fig. 2(b) is \sigma_{xy} vs H\cos\theta for Tl2212 at T\!=\!96 K and \theta\!=\!0^{\circ}, 30^{\circ}, 50^{\circ}, and 70^{\circ}. The dashed curve is given by \sigma_{xy}\!\!=\!-54 (T/\Omega cm)/\mu_{\rm o}H_{z}\!+\!2 (1/T \Omega cm)\mu_{\rm o}H_{z}. We have made similar measurements from T\!=\!98 to 70 K, and over this temperature range the form of the low field divergence in \sigma_{xy} varies from diverging slower than 1/H at high temperatures to diverging faster at our lowest temperatures. Samoilov _et al.[23]_ have also measured \sigma_{xy} in the mixed state of Tl2212, where they fit \sigma_{xy} to 1/H at low fields.

Based on the anisotropic-mass model of Ref. [16], the anisotropy has the same effect as reducing the field component

The angle \theta is measured with respect to the c axis. (b) \rho_{xx} and \rho_{xy} vs H\cos\theta (the field component along the c axis).

  in the superconducting planes. Thus in the limit of very large anisotropy, such as in NCCO and TI2212, scaling behavior with H_{z}\!=\!H\cos\theta is expected. YBCO, which is closer to being isotropic than NCCO or TI2212, has a less obvious scaling behavior. The more general result of Ref. [16] says that the field should be scaled to \tilde{H}\!=\!H\!\sqrt{\cos^{2}\!\theta\!+\!\Gamma^{-1}\!\sin^{2}\!\theta}, and that there is a scaling factor H_{z}/\tilde{H} for the Hall components of the conductivity and resistivity tensors, where again \Gamma is the effective mass anisotropy ratio. In Fig. 3(a) we plot \tan\tilde{\theta}_{H}\!=\!\tan\theta_{H}\tilde{H}/H_{z} vs \tilde{H} for \theta\!\!=\!\!0^{\circ}, 40^{\circ}, and 55^{\circ} at T\!=\!87 K, and \Gamma\!=\!39 for our YBCO film. From the figure it is clear that the Hall angle increases as the field is tilted away from the c axis, similar to the angular dependence of \rho_{xy} in YBCO.[6] The enhancement may be due to a weakening of pinning by defects, as it has been argued that \tan\theta_{H}, and similarly \rho_{xx} and \rho_{xy}, depend on pinning,[20; 21] and pinning by defects is anisotropic, being weaker when the field is directed into the ab plane.[16] The enhancement vanishes as H\!\!\rightarrow\!\!H_{c2}, presumably due to less flux pinning and a larger quasiparticle contribution to the Hall effect at high fields. In contrast, the enhancement is difficult to observe in NCCO and TI2212, where, as a result of their large anisotropies the extrinsic pinning will be noticeably weaker only when the field is directed nearly parallel to the plane (\theta\!\!\sim\!\!90^{\circ}). Unfortunately, within the field limit of our magnet (9 T) the signals are too small at these angles to observe this effect.

To understand how vortex motion is affected by pinning we consider the work of Vinokur, Geshkenbein, Feigel'man, and Blatter (VGFB),[20] who have argued that macroscopically the appropriate equation of motion for each vortex is

\[\eta\nu\!+\!\alpha\nu\!\times\!\hat{\bf n}\!=\!\phi_{\rm d}\!]\!\times\!\hat{ \bf n}\!+\!\langle F_{\rm piz}\rangle,\] (1)

where \eta is the viscous-drag coefficient associated with dissipation in the mixed state, {\bf j} is the transport current density, \hat{\bf n} is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetic field, {\bf v} is the average vortex velocity, \alpha determines the sign and the magnitude of the Hall angle in the absence of pinning by the relation \tan\!\theta_{H}\!=\!\alpha/\eta, \phi_{0}\!=\!h/2e is the flux quantum, and \langle F_{\rm piz}\rangle is the average pinning force. VGFB further argue that the average pinning force can be replaced by a term which, to leading order, is linear in the vortex velocity,

\[[\,\eta\!+\!\gamma(v)\,]\!\nu\!+\!\alpha\nu\!\times\!\hat{\bf n}\!=\!\phi_{\rm d }\!]\!\times\!\hat{\bf n},\] (2)

so that pinning has the effect of renormalizing the drag coefficient, \eta\!\rightarrow\!\eta\!+\!\gamma(v). Therefore, \tan\!\theta_{H}\!=\!\alpha/\eta\!\rightarrow\!\alpha/[\,\eta]+\!\gamma(v) will change as pinning is varied. The Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy}\!=\!\alpha/\phi_{0}B is predicted to be _independent of pinning_.

In Fig. 3(b) we plot the scaled Hall conductivity \tilde{\sigma}_{xy}\!=\!\sigma_{xy}\tilde{H}/H_{z} vs \tilde{H}. As can be seen from the figure the data for all \theta collapse to a single curve using one adjustable parameter \Gamma\!=\!39 (\xi_{ab}\!=\!6\xi_{c}, in agreement with other measurements[24]). Similar results have been previously reported by Harris _et al.[7]_ In light of the behavior of \tan\!\tilde{\theta}_{H} in Fig. 3(a), the scaling of the Hall conductivity is remarkable, and adds credence to the idea that \sigma_{xy} does not depend on disorder.[20; 21] The dashed curve is given by \tilde{\sigma}_{xy}\!=\!-14\,26 (T/\Omega cm)/\mu_{0}\tilde{H}\!+\!57 (1/\Gamma\Omega cm)/\mu_{0}\tilde{H}, similar to the behavior we observe in NCCO and TI2212. In all our thin-film YBCO samples we observe the deviation of the data from the low end of the dashed curve, i.e., deviation from 1/H. We observe similar results closer to T_{c}, as well as down to our

Figure 4: (a) Nonohmic tang\theta_{H} vs H in an a-Mo_{3}Si film at T\!=\!3.7 K (T_{c}\!\!=\!7.5 K) for current densities j\!=\!2.6 to 52 KA/cm^{2} all in excess of j_{c}.

  lowest temperatures, T = 83 K. At low fields the pinning is strongest, thus these results may signal that \sigma_{xy} has some disorder dependence in the strong-pinning limit.[25] More work is in progress to resolve this issue.

Next we consider our high-current measurements on low-pinning _a_-Mo_{3}Si as an alternative probe to test the disorder independence of \sigma_{xy}. The most direct way to verify the predictions for tan\theta_{H} and \sigma_{xy} within the theoretical framework of VGFB is with high currents. The increase of the transport-current density d gives the vortices to higher velocities **v** via the Lorentz force \phi_{0}**j**\times**\hat{\textbf{n}}**, thus reducing the pinning parameter \gamma(v) (\times 1/\sqrt{v}, for example[20]). _a_-Mo_{3}Si is ideal for this purpose because of its very small depinning current density (j_{c}\sim 1000 A/cm^{2} at T = 4.2 K and 1 T<\mu_{0}_H_< 4 T), which is easily exceeded with minimal sample heating (\leq15 mW/cm^{2}). At high fields where the sample resistance is significantly larger we use a pulsed (20 \mus) current technique to further avoid heating. In Fig. 4(a) we plot tan\theta_{H} vs H at T = 3.7 K for a range of current densities all in excess of j_{c} (in the nonohmic regime). We observe a large increase in the Hall angle with increasing current density, similar to that observed in YBCO as the field is rotated into the plane (Fig. 3). Another similarity between tan\theta_{H} in Figs. 3 and 4 is the vanishing of the enhancement as H \rightarrow_H__{c2}.

In Fig. 4(b) we show \sigma_{xy} vs H at the same current densities as in Fig. 4(a). Remarkably, \sigma_{xy} is independent of the current density, an excellent confirmation of the pinning independence of \sigma_{xy}. This result casts serious doubt on theories which invoke pinning to explain the sign anomaly.[5] (The deviation at j = 52 kA/cm^{2} is a result of j approaching the depairing critical current j_{0}, so T_{c} is slightly suppressed.) The log-log scale in the inset indicates that over more than a decade of our lowest fields \sigma_{xy}\sim 1/_H_ (the solid curve has slope - 1), and extends to fields nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than \mu_{0}\mu_{c2}\approx 7.5 T. Our measurements at both lower and higher temperatures (_T_ = 7 and 1.4 K) are consistent with these results.

In summary, we have shown that the angular dependence of the Hall conductivity for the anisotropic superconductors NCCO, TI2212, and YBCO can be scaled in terms of their anisotropy. This is possible, in particular for YBCO, because the effects of pinning drop out of \sigma_{xy} . We further demonstrated the pinning independence of \sigma_{xy} using high-current densities on _a_-Mo_{3}Si. The implications of this result are quite important as the Hall conductivity presents experiments with a measurable transport quantity which is not clouded by extrinsic pinning effects. This result, in particular, contradicts theories which explain the sign anomaly as a pinning effect.[5] Finally, our data provides evidence for a universal low-field behavior of \sigma_{xy}\sim 1/_H_, as predicted for vortex dynamics.[4, 8, 9]

###### Abstract

We have studied the mixed-state Hall effect of the high-T_{c} superconductors Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4} (NCCO), Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8} (Tl2212), and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (YBCO), and the isotropic low-T_{c} superconductor amorphous Mo_{3}Si (_a_-Mo_{3}Si). We demonstrate the pinning independence of the Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy} and its consequent scaling in terms of the anisotropy of NCCO, Tl2212, and YBCO. In YBCO and _a_-Mo_{3}Si the Hall angle is enhanced as we reduce the effective pinning, yet \sigma_{xy} is unchanged. For all of these materials there is a vortex contribution \sigma_{xy}\sim1/H at low fields while at high fields \sigma_{xy}\simH. These results provide evidence that beneath the effects of pinning and anisotropy a relatively simple and universal behavior of the mixed-state Hall effect exists.

The transport properties of superconductors in the vortex state, though widely studied, still present many puzzles. In particular, a wide range of both high-T_{c} and low-T_{c} materials show a sign change of the Hall effect below T_{c}.[1] In the mixed state, vortices moving with velocity **v** generate a spatially averaged electric field according to Josephson's relation \textbf{E}\!=\!-\textbf{v}\!\times\!\textbf{B}.[2] When the flux lines are pinned a transport current flows around the vortices with no energy loss (\textbf{E}\!=\!\textbf{0}). However, when the vortices move current passes through the vortex core, dissipating energy and generating a Hall voltage. In the simplest models this leads to a mixed-state Hall effect of the same sign as in the normal state.[34]

A difficulty in developing a model of the mixed-state Hall effect, in addition to predicting a sign change, is that a wide variety of temperature and field dependences have been reported,[1] at least partly due to the range of pinning strengths and anisotropy in these materials. In fact, recent models have suggested the sign change is related to the specific properties of flux pinning[5] or layered structures.[6, 7] In this report, we account for anisotropy and demonstrate that the Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy} is _independent of pinning_, strongly suggesting that neither pinning nor anisotropic structures are the origin of the sign anomaly. In addition, the Hall conductivity for a variety of superconductors, both anisotropic high T_{c} and isotropic low T_{c}, has a contribution \sigma_{xy}\!\sim\!1/H which is presumably intrinsic to vortex dynamics.[4, 8, 9]

We measure the longitudinal voltage V_{xx} and the Hall voltage V_{xy} with the transport current in the _ab_ plane perpendicular to the magnetic field (up to 9 T). The magnetic field is ramped from high to low fields at both polarities with the temperature fixed; V_{xy} is the component of the transverse voltage odd in applied field. The sample mount has a rotating stage for changing the field direction, a magnetic-field-insensitive Cernox metal film thermometer, and a carbon glass thermometer with a calibration in magnetic field. The Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8} (Tl2212) sample is a _c_-axis oriented 5000-A-thick film prepared by laser ablation from a single target followed by post-deposition heat processing with T_{c}\!\equiv104 K and j_{c}\!\approx\!10^{6}A/cm^{2} at 77 K. The Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4} (NCCO) measurements were made on a _c_-axis oriented 20-\mum-thick single crystal with T_{c}\!\equiv\!24 K (details of the preparation are given in Ref. [10]). The YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (YBCO) measurements were made on a _c_-axis oriented 1000-A-thick film grown by pulsed laser ablation with T_{c}\!\equiv\!92 K. The amorphous Mo_{3}Si (_a_-Mo_{3}Si) sample is an isotropic amorphous film of 250-A thickness with T_{c}\!\equiv\!7.5 K; details of the sample preparation and characterization are given in Refs. [11] and [12].

An interesting way to vary the transport properties of anisotropic materials is to change the magnetic field direction.[13] For our measurements we rotate the sample, varying the angle \theta between the c axis and the field, while keeping the current and field perpendicular to each other. In Fig. 1(a) we show the in-plane longitudinal resistivity, \rho_{xx} vs H, measured on our NCCO single crystal at T\!=\!16 K for \theta\!=\!0^{\circ}, 30^{\circ}, 50^{\circ}, and 70^{\circ}. As \theta increases the \rho_{xx} vs H transitions move out to higher fields, reflecting the increase in H_{c2} as the field is directed into the _ab_ plane. The effective mass anisotropy ratio is defined as \Gamma\!=\!m_{c}/m_{ab}\!=\!(H_{c2}^{\dagger}/H_{c2}^{\dagger})^{2}\!=\!\xi_{ab} ^{2}/\xi_{c2}^{2}\!\approx\!10^{3} for NCCO,[14] where H_{c2}^{\dagger} (\propto\!1/\xi_{ab}\xi_{c}) and H_{c2}^{\dagger} (\propto\!1/\xi_{ab}^{2}) correspond to H_{c2} with the field applied parallel and perpendicular to the _ab_ plane, respectively. In Fig. 1(b) we plot \rho_{xx} vs H\cos\theta. The data for all \theta collapse very nicely to a single curve, indicating that only the field component parallel to the c axis (H\cos\theta) is contributing to the dissipation. We have observed the scaling of \rho_{xx} with H\cos\theta from T\!=\!19 K down to T\!=\!4 K, which is the temperature range of our measurements. We have not pursued the high angle regime, \theta\!\to\!90^{\circ}, where various two-dimensional[15] (2D) and anisotropic 3D models[16, 17] are distinguishable, as done on Bi2212,[18] for example. Our primary interest is to point out that the field component along the c axis is dictating the vortex dynamics.

Also shown in Fig. 1(b) is the Hall resistivity \rho_{xy} vs H\cos\theta for T\!=\!16 K. The scaling with H\cos\theta indicates that the in-plane Hall effect, and in particular the sign anomaly, arises strictly from vortex segments aligned parallel to the c axis. In the normal state \rho_{xy} scales with H\cos\theta for all materials, whereas in the mixed state of a superconductor this simple scaling form is only expected to hold in the large anisotropy limit.[16, 17] In the limit of large anisotropy (and \theta not too near 90^{\circ}), 3D anisotropic-mass models predict F_{ij}(H,\theta)\!=\!F_{ij}(H\cos\theta), where F is a transport quantity such as resistivity \rho or conductivity \sigma and ij\!=\!xx or ij\!=\!xy.

As can be seen in Fig. 1, both \rho_{xx} and \rho_{xy} become imeasantly small below a minimum field \mu_{\rm o}H_{\rm min}\!\approx\!\frac{1}{2} T due to flux pinning. To observe free-flux flow at low currents it is necessary to go into a regime where the pinning potential is weak (H\!\!\approx\!\!H_{\rm min}). However, H_{\rm min}(T) is the same order of magnitude as H_{\rm c2}(T), even in relatively low-pinning materials. High-current densities can be used to suppress pinning,[12, 19] but it is difficult to increase the current density without heating in single crystals. An alternative is to measure a pinning-independent quantity, such as predicted for \sigma_{xy},[20, 21] which still elucidates the essential physics.

In Fig. 2(a) we report the data from Fig. 1 as \sigma_{xy} vs H_{\rm z} (\sigma_{xy} vs H\cos\theta), where \sigma_{xy}\!=\!\rho_{xy}/(\rho_{xx}^{2}\!+\!\rho_{xy}^{2}). The dashed curve is a fit to \sigma_{xy}\!=\!c_{1}/H_{z}\!+\!c_{2}H_{x}, yielding \sigma_{xy}\!=\!95 (T/\Omega cm)/\mu_{\rm o}H_{z}\!-\!40 (1/T \Omega cm)\mu_{\rm o}H_{z}. The linear contribution to \sigma_{xy} has the same sign and field dependence as the normal-state Hall conductivity. The coefficient of the 1/H term is opposite in sign to the normal state, thus this term leads to a sign reversal. Several models predict a vortex contribution to the Hall conductivity of the form \sigma_{xy}\!\sim\!1/B,[4, 8, 9] we note in our experiments B\!\cong\!\mu_{\rm o}H. Nozieres and Vinen[4] suggest this form, but with a coefficient of the same sign as in the normal state. Based on time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) theory, Dorsey[8] and Kopnin[9] argue that for H\!\!\!\ll\!\!H_{c2}\sigma_{xy}\!\!\sim\!\!1/B, as flux flow dominates the conductivity, and allow a sign change depending on electronic structure. They go on to argue that near H_{\rm c2} the conductivity is the normal-state conductivity plus a correction due to vortex motion which decreases as H_{c2}\!-\!B.[8, 9] A convenient way to interpolate between the low- and high-field regimes is to write \sigma_{xy}\!=\!c_{1}/B\!+\!c_{2}B, which models our data reasonably well, but we note that this additive form for \sigma_{xy} is not a consequence of TDGL theory.

We observe similar results for Tl2212 [\Gamma\!\!\sim\!\!10^{4} (Ref. [22]) both in the angular dependence as well as the field dependence of the Hall conductivity. Displayed in Fig. 2(b) is \sigma_{xy} vs H\cos\theta for Tl2212 at T\!=\!96 K and \theta\!=\!0^{\circ}, 30^{\circ}, 50^{\circ}, and 70^{\circ}. The dashed curve is given by \sigma_{xy}\!\!=\!-54 (T/\Omega cm)/\mu_{\rm o}H_{z}\!+\!2 (1/T \Omega cm)\mu_{\rm o}H_{z}. We have made similar measurements from T\!=\!98 to 70 K, and over this temperature range the form of the low field divergence in \sigma_{xy} varies from diverging slower than 1/H at high temperatures to diverging faster at our lowest temperatures. Samoilov _et al.[23]_ have also measured \sigma_{xy} in the mixed state of Tl2212, where they fit \sigma_{xy} to 1/H at low fields.

Based on the anisotropic-mass model of Ref. [16], the anisotropy has the same effect as reducing the field component

Figure 1: (a) Longitudinal resistivity \rho_{xx} vs H at T\!=\!16 K, for several tilts of the field in a single crystal of Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO (NCCO) with T_{c}\!=\!24 K. The angle \theta is measured with respect to the c axis. (b) \rho_{xx} and \rho_{xy} vs H\cos\theta (the field component along the c axis).

  in the superconducting planes. Thus in the limit of very large anisotropy, such as in NCCO and TI2212, scaling behavior with H_{z}\!=\!H\cos\theta is expected. YBCO, which is closer to being isotropic than NCCO or TI2212, has a less obvious scaling behavior. The more general result of Ref. [16] says that the field should be scaled to \tilde{H}\!=\!H\!\sqrt{\cos^{2}\!\theta\!+\!\Gamma^{-1}\!\sin^{2}\!\theta}, and that there is a scaling factor H_{z}/\tilde{H} for the Hall components of the conductivity and resistivity tensors, where again \Gamma is the effective mass anisotropy ratio. In Fig. 3(a) we plot \tan\tilde{\theta}_{H}\!=\!\tan\theta_{H}\tilde{H}/H_{z} vs \tilde{H} for \theta\!\!=\!\!0^{\circ}, 40^{\circ}, and 55^{\circ} at T\!=\!87 K, and \Gamma\!=\!39 for our YBCO film. From the figure it is clear that the Hall angle increases as the field is tilted away from the c axis, similar to the angular dependence of \rho_{xy} in YBCO.[6] The enhancement may be due to a weakening of pinning by defects, as it has been argued that \tan\theta_{H}, and similarly \rho_{xx} and \rho_{xy}, depend on pinning,[20; 21] and pinning by defects is anisotropic, being weaker when the field is directed into the ab plane.[16] The enhancement vanishes as H\!\!\rightarrow\!\!H_{c2}, presumably due to less flux pinning and a larger quasiparticle contribution to the Hall effect at high fields. In contrast, the enhancement is difficult to observe in NCCO and TI2212, where, as a result of their large anisotropies the extrinsic pinning will be noticeably weaker only when the field is directed nearly parallel to the plane (\theta\!\!\sim\!\!90^{\circ}). Unfortunately, within the field limit of our magnet (9 T) the signals are too small at these angles to observe this effect.

To understand how vortex motion is affected by pinning we consider the work of Vinokur, Geshkenbein, Feigel'man, and Blatter (VGFB),[20] who have argued that macroscopically the appropriate equation of motion for each vortex is

\[\eta\nu\!+\!\alpha\nu\!\times\!\hat{\bf n}\!=\!\phi_{\rm d}\!]\!\times\!\hat{ \bf n}\!+\!\langle F_{\rm piz}\rangle,\] (1)

where \eta is the viscous-drag coefficient associated with dissipation in the mixed state, {\bf j} is the transport current density, \hat{\bf n} is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetic field, {\bf v} is the average vortex velocity, \alpha determines the sign and the magnitude of the Hall angle in the absence of pinning by the relation \tan\!\theta_{H}\!=\!\alpha/\eta, \phi_{0}\!=\!h/2e is the flux quantum, and \langle F_{\rm piz}\rangle is the average pinning force. VGFB further argue that the average pinning force can be replaced by a term which, to leading order, is linear in the vortex velocity,

\[[\,\eta\!+\!\gamma(v)\,]\!\nu\!+\!\alpha\nu\!\times\!\hat{\bf n}\!=\!\phi_{\rm d }\!]\!\times\!\hat{\bf n},\] (2)

so that pinning has the effect of renormalizing the drag coefficient, \eta\!\rightarrow\!\eta\!+\!\gamma(v). Therefore, \tan\!\theta_{H}\!=\!\alpha/\eta\!\rightarrow\!\alpha/[\,\eta]+\!\gamma(v) will change as pinning is varied. The Hall conductivity \sigma_{xy}\!=\!\alpha/\phi_{0}B is predicted to be _independent of pinning_.

In Fig. 3(b) we plot the scaled Hall conductivity \tilde{\sigma}_{xy}\!=\!\sigma_{xy}\tilde{H}/H_{z} vs \tilde{H}. As can be seen from the figure the data for all \theta collapse to a single curve using one adjustable parameter \Gamma\!=\!39 (\xi_{ab}\!=\!6\xi_{c}, in agreement with other measurements[24]). Similar results have been previously reported by Harris _et al.[7]_ In light of the behavior of \tan\!\tilde{\theta}_{H} in Fig. 3(a), the scaling of the Hall conductivity is remarkable, and adds credence to the idea that \sigma_{xy} does not depend on disorder.[20; 21] The dashed curve is given by \tilde{\sigma}_{xy}\!=\!-14\,26 (T/\Omega cm)/\mu_{0}\tilde{H}\!+\!57 (1/\Gamma\Omega cm)/\mu_{0}\tilde{H}, similar to the behavior we observe in NCCO and TI2212. In all our thin-film YBCO samples we observe the deviation of the data from the low end of the dashed curve, i.e., deviation from 1/H. We observe similar results closer to T_{c}, as well as down to our

Figure 4: (a) Nonohmic tang\theta_{H} vs H in an a-Mo_{3}Si film at T\!=\!3.7 K (T_{c}\!\!=\!7.5 K) for current densities j\!=\!2.6 to 52 KA/cm^{2} all in excess of j_{c}. (b) Nonohmic \sigma_{xy} vs H_{z} over the same range of currents as above. (Inset) -\sigma_{xy} vs H on a log-log scale for the same range of currents. The solid curve has slope of -1.

  lowest temperatures, T = 83 K. At low fields the pinning is strongest, thus these results may signal that \sigma_{xy} has some disorder dependence in the strong-pinning limit.[25] More work is in progress to resolve this issue.

Next we consider our high-current measurements on low-pinning _a_-Mo_{3}Si as an alternative probe to test the disorder independence of \sigma_{xy}. The most direct way to verify the predictions for tan\theta_{H} and \sigma_{xy} within the theoretical framework of VGFB is with high currents. The increase of the transport-current density d gives the vortices to higher velocities **v** via the Lorentz force \phi_{0}**j**\times**\hat{\textbf{n}}**, thus reducing the pinning parameter \gamma(v) (\times 1/\sqrt{v}, for example[20]). _a_-Mo_{3}Si is ideal for this purpose because of its very small depinning current density (j_{c}\sim 1000 A/cm^{2} at T = 4.2 K and 1 T<\mu_{0}_H_< 4 T), which is easily exceeded with minimal sample heating (\leq15 mW/cm^{2}). At high fields where the sample resistance is significantly larger we use a pulsed (20 \mus) current technique to further avoid heating. In Fig. 4(a) we plot tan\theta_{H} vs H at T = 3.7 K for a range of current densities all in excess of j_{c} (in the nonohmic regime). We observe a large increase in the Hall angle with increasing current density, similar to that observed in YBCO as the field is rotated into the plane (Fig. 3). Another similarity between tan\theta_{H} in Figs. 3 and 4 is the vanishing of the enhancement as H \rightarrow_H__{c2}.

In Fig. 4(b) we show \sigma_{xy} vs H at the same current densities as in Fig. 4(a). Remarkably, \sigma_{xy} is independent of the current density, an excellent confirmation of the pinning independence of \sigma_{xy}. This result casts serious doubt on theories which invoke pinning to explain the sign anomaly.[5] (The deviation at j = 52 kA/cm^{2} is a result of j approaching the depairing critical current j_{0}, so T_{c} is slightly suppressed.) The log-log scale in the inset indicates that over more than a decade of our lowest fields \sigma_{xy}\sim 1/_H_ (the solid curve has slope - 1), and extends to fields nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than \mu_{0}\mu_{c2}\approx 7.5 T. Our measurements at both lower and higher temperatures (_T_ = 7 and 1.4 K) are consistent with these results.

In summary, we have shown that the angular dependence of the Hall conductivity for the anisotropic superconductors NCCO, TI2212, and YBCO can be scaled in terms of their anisotropy. This is possible, in particular for YBCO, because the effects of pinning drop out of \sigma_{xy} . We further demonstrated the pinning independence of \sigma_{xy} using high-current densities on _a_-Mo_{3}Si. The implications of this result are quite important as the Hall conductivity presents experiments with a measurable transport quantity which is not clouded by extrinsic pinning effects. This result, in particular, contradicts theories which explain the sign anomaly as a pinning effect.[5] Finally, our data provides evidence for a universal low-field behavior of \sigma_{xy}\sim 1/_H_, as predicted for vortex dynamics.[4, 8, 9]
