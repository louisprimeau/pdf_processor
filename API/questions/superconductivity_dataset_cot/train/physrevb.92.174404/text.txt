###### Abstract

We have systematically grown large single crystals of the layered compounds \(\beta\)-PdBi\({}_{2}\), and both the hole-doped PdBi\({}_{2-x}\)Pb\({}_{x}\) and the electron-doped Na\({}_{x}\)PdBi\({}_{2}\), and studied their magnetic and transport properties. Hall effect measurements on PdBi\({}_{2}\), PdBi\({}_{1.8}\)Pb\({}_{0.2}\), and Na\({}_{0.05}\)PdBi\({}_{2}\) show that the charge transport is dominated by electrons in all of the samples. The electron concentration is substantially reduced upon Pb doping in PdBi\({}_{2-x}\)Pb\({}_{x}\) and increased upon Na intercalation in Na\({}_{x}\)PdBi\({}_{2}\), indicating effective hole doping by Pb and electron doping by Na. We observed a monotonic decrease of the superconducting transition temperature (\(T_{c}\)) from 5.4 K in undoped PdBi\({}_{2}\) to less than 2 K for \(x>0.35\) in hole-doped PdBi\({}_{2-x}\)Pb\({}_{x}\). Meanwhile, a rapid decrease of \(T_{c}\) with Na intercalation is also observed in the electron-doped Na\({}_{x}\)PdBi\({}_{2}\), which is in disagreement with the theoretical expectation. In addition, both the magnetoresistance and Hall resistance further reveal evidence for a possible spin excitation associated with Fermi surface reconstruction at \(\sim\)50 K in the Na-intercalated PdBi\({}_{2}\) sample. The complete phase diagram is thus established from hole doping to electron doping. Meanwhile, a high-pressure study of the undoped PdBi\({}_{2}\) shows that the \(T_{c}\) is linearly suppressed under pressure with a \(dT_{c}/dP\) coefficient of \(-0.28\) K/GPa.

## I Introduction

Low-dimensional compounds, with simple structure building motifs and weak bonding force between layers, have generated much research interest within condensed matter physics over the past several decades. These low-dimensional materials have displayed a variety of unusual physical phenomena such as charge density waves in transition metal chalcogenides [1,2]; spin density waves in the parent Fe pnictide superconductors [3,4]; topological order in Bi\({}_{2}\)Se\({}_{3}\)[5,6]; and superconductivity in many compounds such as MgB\({}_{2}\)[7], doped ZrNCl [8], etc. In the binary Pd-Bi alloy family, several phases with different structures have been studied in the past [9]; in this family the PdBi\({}_{2}\) is found to crystallize in two different layered structures with a low-temperature \(\alpha\) phase below 380 degC and a high-temperature \(\beta\) phase between 380 and 490 degC [10]. The \(\alpha\)-PdBi\({}_{2}\) crystallizes in a layered monoclinic (\(c2/m\)) structure with a six-coordinated PdBi\({}_{6}\) building motif, while the \(\beta\)-PdBi\({}_{2}\) forms a layered tetragonal CuZr\({}_{2}\)-type structure (\(I4/mmm\)) with an eight-coordinated PdBi\({}_{8}\) building motif. Every four Bi atoms in \(\beta\)-PdBi\({}_{2}\) are face shared with the neighboring CsCl-type PdBi\({}_{8}\) motif and therefore form a PdBi\({}_{8/4}\) = PdBi\({}_{2}\) layer. The resulting PdBi\({}_{2}\) layers are packed alternately and form the body-centered tetragonal structure, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a). The interlayer spacing between the alternating PdBi\({}_{2}\) layers is rather large, with interlayer Bi-Bi distance of \(\sim\)3.8 A, indicating that there is no effective bonding between those layers. Various phases in the Pb-Bi system have been identified as superconductors [11], such as \(\alpha\)-PdBi with \(T_{c}\sim\) 3.8 K, \(\alpha\)-PdBi\({}_{2}\) with \(T_{c}\sim\) 1.73 K, \(\beta\)-PdBi\({}_{2}\) with \(T_{c}\sim\) 4.25 K, and Pd\({}_{2.5}\)Bi\({}_{1.5}\) with \(T_{c}\sim\) 3.7-4 K. Early studies showed that \(\beta\)-PdBi\({}_{2}\) had the highest \(T_{c}\) among these phases, 4.25 K [11], and it was recently shown that the \(T_{c}\) could be further raised to 5.4 K by improving the sample quality [12]. However, neither the details of the chemical doping nor the high-pressure effect are well known in \(\beta\)-PdBi\({}_{2}\). The prior specific heat and STM studies on \(\beta\)-PdBi\({}_{2}\) suggest that it is a multiband superconductor [12,13], which is in agreement with the results from first-principles calculations [14]. Theoretical calculation shows that the density of states (DOS) around the Fermi level is dominated by the Pd \(4d\) and Bi \(6\,\rho\) states, and that the Fermi level is located on a positive slope below a DOS peak. Therefore, hole doping is expected to shift the Fermi level away from the DOS peak, resulting in a decrease of the DOS at the Fermi level, while electron doping will increase it. Thus one would expect a decrease of \(T_{c}\) upon hole doping and an increase of \(T_{c}\) under electron doping. Under this motivation, we decided to carry out systematic hole doping (substitution of Bi with Pb) and electron doping (Na intercalation) studies on the \(\beta\)-PdBi\({}_{2}\) system. However, we found that the \(T_{c}\) was suppressed in both cases, the reasons for which will be discussed in this paper. Meanwhile, a high-pressure study was also carried out on the \(\beta\)-PdBi\({}_{2}\) single crystal, and we observed a suppression of \(T_{c}\) upon applying pressure with a \(dT_{c}/dP\) coefficient of \(-0.28\) K/GPa. The phase diagrams, both upon chemical doping and under high pressure, are presented.

## II Experimental details

The \(\beta\)-PdBi\({}_{2}\) single crystals were synthesized through a melt-growth method. Stoichiometric amounts of Pd and Bi grains were sealed in an evacuated quartz tube, which was heated up to 700 degC, kept for 10 h, and then slowly cooled to 450degC over 30 h. In order to retain the \(\beta\) phase, the tube was then quenched in iced water directly from 450 degC. Similarly, it was attempted to grow a series of PdBi\({}_{2-x}\)Pb\({}_{x}\) (\(x\) = 0.0, 0.08, 0.15, 0.20, 0.28, 0.35, 0.40 0.60, 0.80, and 1.0) crystals with stoichiometric amounts of Pd, Bi, and Pb. In addition, the Na\({}_{x}\)PdBi\({}_{2}\) compounds were grown by mixing Na and the previously obtained PdBi\({}_{2}\) precursor, followed by the same synthetic conditions but using a carbon-coated quartz tube to prevent the possible reaction of sodium with the quartz tube at high temperature. The carbon coating of the quartz tube was found to be intact after the synthesis, indicating the success of the growth. X-ray powder diffraction was performed on the powdered Pb-doped single crystals at room temperature from 10\({}^{\circ}\) to 90\({}^{\circ}\) using a Panalytical X'pert diffractometer. The actual chemical compositions were determined by wavelength-dispersive spectrometry (WDS) on a JEOL JXA-8600 electron microprobe analyzer. At least six well-separated points across the crystal were measured to confirm the homogeneity of the dopants. The dc magnetic susceptibility was measured as a function of temperature, \(\chi(T)\), using a Quantum Design magnetic property measurement system (MPMS) down to 2 K. Electrical resistivity as a function of temperature, \(\rho(T)\), and field, \(\rho(H)\), was measured by employing a standard four-probe method using a Linear Research LR400 ac bridge operated at 15.9 Hz in a Quantum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS) up to 7 T and down to 1.9 K. High-pressure resistivity measurements with a four-lead technique using the LR-400 resistance bridge were made in a Be-Cu pressure cell using Fluorinert FC77 as the pressure medium. A lead manometer was used to measure the pressure \(\mu\, sin\) with the LR400 inductance bridge [15]. The Hall resistivity measurements were performed in the PPMS system with fields up to 5 T using the five-lead technique, which balanced the longitudinal resistance at close to zero.

## III Results and discussion

\(\beta\)-PdBi\({}_{2}\) single crystals with shining metallic luster, typical size of 5 mm, and preferred orientation along the \(c\) axis after cleavage, could be obtained through the melt-growth technique, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The calculated lattice parameter \(c\) [12.963(3) A] is consistent with previous reports [12]. A representative SEM image of the undoped \(\beta\)-PdBi\({}_{2}\) single crystal is also shown as the inset of Fig. 1(a). Both resistivity and magnetization measurements have shown that the superconducting transition temperature of the as-grown \(\beta\)-PdBi\({}_{2}\) crystal is 5.4 K, indicating the improved quality of the grown crystals as also pointed out by previous reports [12]. The resistivity curve exhibits a hump below 150 K and a minor downturn around 50 K, as shown in Fig. 1(b), suggesting possible strong electron/spin correlation in this compound.

Figure 2 shows the powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns with Miller indices of the crushed crystals for the Pb-doped PdBi\({}_{2-x}\)Pb\({}_{x}\) (\(x=0.08,\ 0.15,\ 0.20,\ 0.28\ 0.35\), and 0.40) samples. Except for a few minor peaks of the \(\alpha\) phase present at low doping level, namely, \(x=0.08\), all of the peaks are well indexed into the \(\beta\)-PdBi\({}_{2}\)-type body-centered tetragonal structures in all of the samples with different doping levels. These crystals are quite stable outside the glovebox for several months. Due to the close radius sizes between Pb and Bi, the change of lattice parameter upon Pb doping is very small, and a gradual decrease of the lattice parameter from 12.963(3) A for \(x=0\) to 12.940(2) A for \(x=0.4\) is observed, but the

  overall lattice parameter change is less than 0.2%. To further confirm the homogeneity of the doped samples and establish the actual doping levels, we performed chemical analyses through WDS measurements on the single crystals. The Pb concentration is homogeneous throughout the whole sample in all cases, indicating the formation of solid solutions for these Pb-doped samples. The actual Pb-doping levels are \(x=\) 0.08(2), 0.14(2), 0.19(2), 0.27(2), 0.34(1), and 0.39(1), for the nominal compositions of \(x=\) 0.08, 0.15, 0.20, 0.28, 0.35, and 0.40 in PdBi\({}_{2-x}\)Pb\({}_{x}\), respectively. The results show that the actual doping levels are very close to the nominal compositions. Some extra impurity peaks belonging to the \(\alpha\)-PdBi\({}_{2}\) monoclinic phase emerge at the doping level \(x=0.60\) from x-ray powder diffraction measurements and become more dominant with further Pb doping. At the doping level of \(x=\) 1.00, the XRD pattern shows a nearly pure phase of the \(\alpha\)-PdBi\({}_{2}\)-type structure with no detectable \(\beta\) phase, implying the solubility limit of the tetragonal \(\beta\)-PdBi\({}_{2-x}\)Pb\({}_{x}\) phase at this high doping level.

Systematic resistivity and magnetization measurements were carried out for all samples with different doping levels. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) of PdBi\({}_{2-x}\)Pb\({}_{x}\) continuously decreases upon Pb substitution, from 5.4 K for \(x=\) 0, to 4.9 K for \(x=\) 0.08, 4.4 K for \(x=\) 0.15, 3.8 K for \(x=\) 0.20, 2.5 K for \(x=\) 0.28, and 2.2 K for \(x=\) 0.35. The sample eventually becomes nonsuperconducting above 2 K when the doping level reaches \(x=\) 0.40. The superconducting transition width (10%-90% resistivity drop) is rather narrow (less than 0.3 K) in all samples, indicating the good quality of the doped samples.

Similar consistent results were obtained through magnetic susceptibility measurements as shown in Fig. 3(b). The magnetization was measured under an applied magnetic field of 2 Oe on randomly oriented small crystals with typical mass \(\sim\)20 mg packed in gelatin capsules. All of the samples with doping level 0 \(<\)\(x<\) 0.35 exhibit substantial diamagnetic shifts at the lowest temperature. The shielding fractions 4\(\pi\)\(\chi\) are close to or exceed 1 without the demagnetization factor correction, which implies the bulk superconducting nature of these samples. Consistent with the resistivity data, the superconducting transition temperature systematically moves downward with doping from 5.2 K for \(x=\) 0 to 2 K for \(x=\) 0.40.

To confirm the effective hole doping by Pb substitution, Hall effect measurements have been carried out to evaluate the charge carrier concentration for the parent compound PdBi\({}_{2}\) and a representative Pb-doped PdBi\({}_{1.8}\)Pb\({}_{0.2}\) sample (Fig. 4). The raw Hall resistivity values \(\rho_{\rm H}\) are linear with the field, with negative slopes for both samples. To further eliminate the effect of possible misalignment of the Hall electrodes, the Hall coefficient \(R_{\rm H}\) was taken as \(R_{\rm H}=[R_{\rm H}(5\ {\rm T})+R_{\rm H}(-5\ {\rm T})]/2\) at each temperature. The inset of Fig. 4 shows the Hall coefficient of PdBi\({}_{2}\) from 6 to 300 K. The Hall coefficient is negative over the whole temperature range and only weakly depends on temperature, suggesting that electron-type charge carriers dominate the charge transport. The value of the Hall coefficient changes by \(<\)30% from 2 to 300 K, implying relatively minor multiband effects, and therefore it is reasonable to evaluate the carrier concentration using the Hall coefficient \(R_{\rm H}\).

The Hall resistivities of the parent compound and the Pb-doped sample under different magnetic fields at 10 K are shown in Fig. 4, where one can see that the contribution

  from magnetoresistance is rather small. The Hall coefficients \(R_{\rm H}\), determined by the slopes of the curves, are \(R_{\rm H}=-4.24\times 10^{-4}\) cm\({}^{3}\)/C and \(R_{\rm H}=-1.12\times 10^{-3}\) cm\({}^{3}\)/C for PdBi\({}_{2}\) and PdBi\({}_{1.8}\)Pb\({}_{0.2}\), respectively. The negative Hall coefficient of the Pb-doped sample indicates that the charge carriers are still dominated by electrons. By simply using the single-band expression \(n=1/R_{\rm H}q\), we can calculate the electron concentrations: \(n=1.47\times 10^{22}\) cm\({}^{-3}\) for PdBi\({}_{2}\) and \(n=5.56\times 10^{21}\) cm\({}^{-3}\) for PdBi\({}_{1.8}\)Pb\({}_{0.2}\). The substantial decrease of electron concentration suggests effective hole doping in the PdBi\({}_{2}\) system through Pb substitution at the Bi site. This effective hole doping might shift the Fermi level, resulting in a lower electronic density of states. Therefore, the lower DOS might contribute to the decrease of \(T_{c}\) if a rigid-band model is adopted.

Since the hole doping by Pb substitution caused decrease of \(T_{c}\), we also attempted to carry out Na intercalation, which would introduce electrons into the system. Several trials with nominal Na concentration ranging from \(x=0.1\) to \(x=0.4\) on Na\({}_{2}\)PdBi\({}_{2}\) were made. X-ray powder diffraction analysis on the resulting bulk materials reveals that some small impurities (less than 10% total) of NaBi and Pd exist in the sample in addition to the formation of the \(\beta\) tetragonal phase. We were able to isolate smaller pure crystals from the bulk samples and carried out detailed chemical analyses and physical measurements. The isolated crystals are homogeneous from WDS analysis and have all of the three elements present. However, the actual Na content is much lower than the nominal composition. Taking the nominal \(x=0.1\) as an example, the actual composition we found from the chemical analysis was Na:Pd:Bi = 0.044(3):1:2.000(5). The highest Na doping level is \(\sim\)0.057(2) determined from the chemical analysis, indicating the relatively low limit of Na intercalation into this compound compared with the Pb doping. The Na-doped crystals were moderately sensitive to air/moisture as they slowly decayed when kept outside the glovebox for one day. This also implies sucessful Na intercalation into the system. The superconducting \(T_{c}\), on the other hand, is rapidly suppressed at such a low Na-doping level, changing from 5.4 K in PdBi\({}_{2}\) down to 4.1 K in Na\({}_{0.044}\)PdBi\({}_{2}\), and further down to 3.9 K in Na\({}_{0.057}\)PdBi\({}_{2}\), as shown in the inset of Fig. 5(a). However, this is in great conflict with the theoretical expectation [13], which suggests that such electronlike doping should shift the Fermi level toward the DOS peak, increasing the DOS at the Fermi level and thus the \(T_{c}\).

To verify whether the DOS does increase through Na intercalation, a Hall measurement was carried out on the Na\({}_{0.057}\)PdBi\({}_{2}\) sample to probe the change of charge carrier concentration. As for PdBi\({}_{2}\), the Hall coefficient \(R_{\rm H}\) above 50 K is \(T\) insensitive for the Na-intercalated sample, as shown in Fig. 5(a). Therefore, the electron concentrations for PdBi\({}_{2}\) and Na\({}_{0.057}\)PdBi\({}_{2}\) are calculated based on the \(R_{\rm H}\) at 50 K as 1.58 \(\times\) 10\({}^{22}\) cm\({}^{-3}\) and 3.09 \(\times\) 10\({}^{22}\) cm\({}^{-3}\), respectively. There is apparently a significant increase of the carrier concentration, which is also in line with the decrease of the room-temperature resistivity observed in Fig. 5(b). The deduced \(d\rho/dT\) at 300 K decreases from 0.37 \(\mu\Omega\) cm/K for PdBi\({}_{2}\) to 0.20 \(\mu\Omega\) cm/K for Na\({}_{0.057}\)PdBi\({}_{2}\). The Na intercalation, therefore, does introduce electrons and enhance the DOS as expected. The suppression of \(T_{c}\) has to be attributed to other mechanisms.

It is well known that both the competing excitations and the impurity scattering (especially pair-broken scattering) may suppress superconductivity. To explore the issue, both the magnetoresistance and the \(R_{\rm H}\) are investigated (Fig. 5). The Hall coefficient \(R_{\rm H}\) is enhanced almost by a factor of 3 on cooling below 50 K [Fig. 5(a)]. As demonstrated previously (Fig. 4 inset), the multiband effect has trivial interference effects on the \(R_{\rm H}\) for the undoped PbBi\({}_{2}\). The unexpected enhancement of the \(R_{\rm H}\) in the Na-intercalated sample can hardly be attributed to the multiband effect, but is more likely caused by certain spin-related scattering/excitations. For example, Han _et al._ have observed that the \(R_{\rm H}\) of SrFeAsF significantly increased with cooling below 150-160 K with the spin-density-wave transition around 173 K [16]. Such an interpretation seems to be supported by both the resistivity and the magnetoresistivity [Fig. 5(b)] data. However, it should be noted that these are rather general characteristics of all spin ordering/excitations. For instance, an anomalous Hall effect and colossal magnetoresistance are observed in the manganites such as La\({}_{1-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)MnO\({}_{3}\)[17, 18]. To explore the situation in Na\({}_{0.057}\)PdBi\({}_{2}\), the \(R(T)\) above 70 K is fitted as a quadratic function of \(T\) [the solid red line in Fig. 5(b)], where the \(R\) drop

(b) Magnetoresistivity of Na\({}_{0.057}\)PdBi\({}_{2}\) from 2 to 300 K (solid black squares, zero field; green crosses, 7 T); The solid red line is only a guide for the eyes. The inset is the ratio of the change in the magnetoresistance \([\rho(7\) T\()-\rho(0\) T\()]/\rho(0\) T\()\) to the magnetic field.

  below 50 K is evident. The \(R(T)\) under a magnetic field of 7 T, in particular, is much higher than that under 0 T [Fig. 5(b) inset] with the deduced \(\partial\ln\,R/\partial\,H\approx 0.05/T\) at 10 K. The enhanced hump feature, the large magnetoresistance, and the increased amplitude of the Hall coefficient below 50 K suggest a Fermi surface reconstruction and excitation/ordering in the spin section around 50 K induced by Na doping. Thus the suppressed superconductivity in Na-intercalated PdBi\({}_{2}\) could be attributed to the competing spin excitation associated with the Fermi surface reconstruction, although the exact nature of this spin excitation needs further investigation.

Based on the above data, we were able to construct the phase diagram of \(T_{c}\) as a function of doping level (both hole and electron doping) as shown in Fig. 6. At the right side of the phase diagram (hole doping), the \(T_{c}\) decreases continuously with Pb doping. The suppression of \(T_{c}\) can be understood as a decrease of the DOS at the Fermi level caused by hole doping. At the left side of the figure, we demonstrate that the \(T_{c}\) is also quickly suppressed by a small amount of Na intercalation. The cause of this \(T_{c}\) suppression might be attributed to the emergence of possible spin exciation, which may compete for the ground state and be counterproductive in stabilizing the superconducting state.

To further examine the above conjectures based on doping, we investigated the pressure effect on the undoped PbBi\({}_{2}\) with the highest \(T_{c}\) of this series by measuring the temperature dependence of resistivity under pressures up to 16.63 kbar, as shown in Fig. 7. As the applied pressure increases, the normal-state resistivity considerably decreases. A closer look at the low temperature part, as shown in Fig. 7(b), reveals that the superconducting transition becomes slightly sharper, and is gradually suppressed, upon applying pressure at a linear suppression rate of \(dT_{c}/dP=-0.28\) K/GPa. At 16.63 kbar, the \(T_{c}\) is reduced to 4.9 K. To verify the stability of the sample, the pressure cell was unloaded to lower pressure and ambient pressure. The corresponding data are denoted as (u) in Fig. 7(b). We observed that superconducting transition \(T_{c}\) values measured upon loading and unloading the pressure cell fell along the same line, proving the stability of the sample in the pressure cycle. The corresponding phase diagram of \(T_{c}\) versus pressure is shown in the inset of Fig. 7(b). The suppression of \(T_{c}\) by pressure appears to be consistent with the doping experiment.

## IV Conclusions

In summary, we have systematically grown large single crystals of the layered compounds \(\beta\)-PdBi\({}_{2}\), the hole-doped PdBi\({}_{2-x}\)Pb\({}_{x}\), and the electron-doped Na\({}_{x}\)PdBi\({}_{2}\), and studied their magnetic and transport properties. Hall measurements on PdBi\({}_{2}\), PdBi\({}_{1.8}\)Pb\({}_{0.2}\), and Na\({}_{0.057}\)PdBi\({}_{2}\) show that the charge transport is dominated by electrons in all of the samples. The electron concentration is substantially reduced upon Pb doping in PdBi\({}_{2-x}\)Pb\({}_{x}\) and increased upon Na intercalation in Na\({}_{x}\)PdBi\({}_{2}\), indicating effective hole doping by Pb and electron doping by Na. In Pb-doped PdBi\({}_{2}\), we observed a monotonic decrease of \(T_{c}\) from 5.4 K in undoped PdBi\({}_{2}\) to

  less than 2 K for \(x>0.35\). The monotonic decrease of the \(T_{c}\) upon doping can be explained by the reduced DOS at the Fermi level. In Na-intercalated samples, a rapid decrease of \(T_{c}\) with a slight Na-intercalation level is also observed, which is in contradiction with the theoretical expectation. Both the magnetoresistance and Hall measurements further reveal evidence for a possible competing spin excitation at \(\sim\)50 K, which could contribute to the suppression of the \(T_{c}\) in Na-intercalated samples. Meanwhile, application of external pressure up to 16.63 kbar on the undoped PdBi\({}_{2}\) also suppresses the superconducting transition linearly with a \(dT_{c}/dP\) coefficient of \(-0.28\) K/GPa, consistent with the doping experiments.
