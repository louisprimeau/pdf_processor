###### Abstract

Two superconducting phases of Re_{3}W have been found with different physical properties. One phase crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric cubic (\alpha-Mn) structure and has a superconducting transition temperature T_{c} of 7.8 K. The other phase has a hexagonal centrosymmetric structure and is superconducting with a T_{c} of 9.4 K. Switching between the two phases is possible by annealing the sample or remelting it. The properties of both phases of Re_{3}W have been characterized by powder neutron diffraction, magnetization, and resistivity measurements. The temperature dependences of the lower and upper critical fields have been measured for both phases. These are used to determine the penetration depths and the coherence lengths for these systems.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) heavy fermion CePt_{3}Si (Ref. [1]) has resulted in a period of intense theoretical and experimental investigation into the physics of noncentrosymmetric superconducting materials. The lack of inversion symmetry in the crystal structure of this type of material along with strong spin-orbit (SO) coupling can lead to a mixing of spin-singlet and spin-triplet pair states.[2] These NCS materials exhibit unusual magnetic properties including suppressed paramagnetic limiting or high upper critical fields [3, 4] as seen in CePt_{3}Si,[1] CeRhSi_{3},[5] and CeIrSi_{3},[6] the appearance of superconductivity with antiferromagnet order in CePt_{3}Si,[7] and superconductivity at the border of ferromagnetism in UIr.[8]

One recent focus of the work on noncentrosymmetric superconductors has been to investigate the properties of transition-metal compounds that have a significant spin-orbit coupling. Here, the complications of the f-electron heavy fermions, such as the strong electron correlations and the possibility of magnetically mediated superconductivity, are expected to be absent. The intermetallic Re_{3}W belongs in this category since it contains heavy atoms with atomic numbers 75 and 74 for Re and W, respectively. Superconductivity in Re_{3}W was first reported in the 1960's. The material was shown to have a cubic \alpha-Mn structure,[9, 10] although it is worth noting that the authors of this early work did not comment on the fact that the \alpha-Mn structure is noncentrosymmetric. Since then, very little experimental work has been done on Re_{3}W. Recent penetration depth measurements carried out on the NCS phase of Re_{3}W by rf tunnel diode resonator and point-contact spectroscopy suggested that Re_{3}W is a weakly coupled isotropic s-wave superconductor.[11, 12, 13]

In this paper, we report on the synthesis of two different superconducting phases of Re_{3}W. One phase has a centrosymmetric (CS) crystal structure, whereas the other has a noncentrosymmetric structure. Switching from the CS to the NCS phase is achieved by annealing the sample, while remelting the NCS sample in an arc furnace returns the sample to the CS structure. The ease with which one can switch between the two phases of Re_{3}W has allowed us to investigate and compare the properties of a CS and a NCS superconducting system using a single material without changes in stoichiometry. We characterize the properties of both phases of Re_{3}W using neutron diffraction, magnetization M, and resistivity \rho measurements. We present the temperature dependence of the lower critical field, H_{c1}, and the upper critical field, H_{c2}, of both materials and also calculate the penetration depths and coherence lengths for these systems.

## II Sample preparation

Samples of the centrosymmetric phase of Re_{3}W were prepared by melting together a stoichiometric mixture of Re lumps (99.99%) and W pieces (99.999%) in an arc furnace on a water-cooled copper hearth using tungsten electrodes in a high-purity Ar atmosphere. After the initial melt, the buttons were turned and remelted several times to ensure homogeneity. Samples of the noncentrosymmetric phase were made by annealing the as-grown samples for 5 days at 1500^{\circ}C in a high-purity Ar atmosphere. The unannealed samples of Re_{3}W are hard but malleable. The samples become brittle after annealing.

## III Results and discussion

### Powder neutron diffraction studies

Time-of-flight powder neutron diffraction data were collected on the General Materials Diffractometer (GEM) at the ISIS facility in the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK.[14] The data were normalized to the incident neutron flux distribution and corrected for detector efficiencies and detector solid angle coverage, with the diffraction patterns collected in the highest resolution backscattering detector bank (average 2\theta = 154^{\circ}) used for structure refinement. Crystal structures were refined by the Rietveld method using the expgui graphical interface for the gsas package.[15, 16] Figure 1 shows the diffraction patterns collected at 295 K from the annealed and unannealed samples of Re_{3}W. The Rietveld refinement shows that the annealed sample has a cubic NCS (\alpha-Mn) structure (space group I\bar{4}3m) with a lattice parameter a = 9.5987(7) A [see Fig. 1(a)]. The diffraction pattern of the unannealed sample shows that this sample has a hexagonal structure with the CS space group P6_{3}/mmc and lattice parameters a = 2.770(3) A and c = 4.5207(6) A [see Fig. 1(b)]. The diffraction patterns of both phases of Re_{3}W contain some peaks (denoted by asterisks) that cannot be indexed, and these regions were excluded during the final stages of structure refinement. Insets of Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) show the crystal structures of the NCS and the CS phases of Re_{3}W. For the CS phase of Re_{3}W, both the Re and the W atoms share the same site, leading to a random distribution of Re and W within the material. For the NCS phase, the refinement indicates that Re and the W atoms occupy preferred crystallographic sites and are therefore distributed in a more orderly fashion within the material. The refined composition of the NCS phase is not stoichiometric indicating there is still some uncertainty in the site occupation. Crystallographic parameters of the two phases of Re_{3}W are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

### Magnetization and resistivity measurements

Magnetization measurements were made as a function temperature in an applied magnetic field of 20 Oe using a Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS) magnetometer. The temperature dependence of the dc magnetic susceptibility, \chi_{\rm dc}(T), shows that the NCS Re_{3}W sample has a superconducting transition temperature, T_{c}^{\rm onset}, of 7.8 K (see Fig. 2) with a transition width \Delta T_{c}=0.21 K. For CS Re_{3}W, the onset of the transition is around 9.4 K with a much broader transition of \Delta T_{c}=0.50 K. Comparable transition widths are observed in the resistivity measurements (see below). This suggests, as expected, that the annealed NCS phase of Re_{3}W is more ordered than the unannealed CS phase. At 2 K, the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) dc susceptibility approaches a value of -1 (\sim100% shielding effect) for both the samples, while the field-cooled (FC) signal shows a flux exclusion (Meissner effect) of \sim5% for the NCS phase and \sim7% for the CS phase.

The ac electrical resistivity was measured as a function of temperature, \rho(T), for both phases of Re_{3}W via a standard four-probe method using a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) (see Fig. 3). The NCS Re_{3}W shows a superconducting transition (onset) at 7.85 K (\Delta T_{c}=0.05 K) while the CS Re_{3}W has a transition at 9.45 K (\Delta T_{c}=0.32 K). The zero-field onset transition temperatures determined from the resistivity measurements are slightly higher than those obtained from the magnetization measurements performed in 20 Oe.

  between 2 and 295 K show metallic behavior for the CS phase of Re_{3}W, whereas it is almost temperature independent above T_{c} in the NCS phase of Re_{3}W (see the inset of Fig. 3). The relative resistance ratio \rho(295K)/\rho(10K) and the room temperature resistivity are 1.15(1) and 1.7\mu\Omega m for the NCS phase and 1.52(1) and 2.1\mu\Omega m for the CS phase, indicating that both samples are poor metals. The NCS phase is the more brittle of the two materials and any extrinsic factors such as microscopic cracks in the sample are more likely to play a role in this material. Given that the room temperature resistivity of the NCS sample is lower than the CS phase we suggest that cracks are not the reason for the high normal-state resistivity. The poor conductivity is more likely to result from a combination of strong electronic scattering and a large temperature-independent residual resistivity due to structural disorder (while the NCS annealed phase is structurally more ordered than the CS phase, the NCS phase still retains a degree of Re/W disorder). We have calculated the mean free path, l_{\text{tr}}, based on the BCS approach [17] using the room temperature resistivity data. The calculations yield l_{\text{tr}}^{\text{NCS}} = 0.277 nm and l_{\text{tr}}^{\text{CS}} = 0.224 nm. These values are comparable with the size of the crystallographic unit cells and given the coherence lengths \xi, derived below, indicate that both phases of Re_{3}W are in the dirty limit.

Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the low-field virgin magnetization data for the NCS and CS phases of Re_{3}W at 1.8 K and Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) show the full magnetization versus applied magnetic field loops collected in the superconducting state at 1.8 K. For the NCS sample the raw M(H) data contain a significant paramagnetic contribution. This contribution

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c} NCS & Re_{3}W & & & & & \\ Atom & Site & x & y & z & Occ. & U_{\text{iso}} (Å^{2}) \\ Re & 2a & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.99(4) & 0.070(5) \\ W & 8c & 0.3192(3) & 0.3192(3) & 0.3192(3) & 1.00 & 0.0068(7) \\ W & 24g & 0.3605(1) & 0.3605(1) & 0.0455(1) & 0.21(2) & 0.0090(3) \\ Re & 24g & 0.3605(1) & 0.3  has been removed from the data shown in Fig. 5(a) by measuring an M(H) curve above T_{c} at 10 K [see inset of Fig. 5(a)]. The signal for the CS sample contains a small linear susceptibility \chi_{\rm dc}=3.53\times 10^{-3} emu/mol [see inset of Fig. 5(b)] that has been subtracted from the data shown in figure 5(b). For the NCS sample, the value of H_{\rm P} (complete penetration of the magnetic field) is 152 Oe, while in the CS sample, H_{\rm P}>2500 Oe. For the NCS phase of Re_{3}W the magnetization is reversible all the way from 70 kOe, the highest field that we can apply in our magnetometer, down to 10 kOe. We presume that the magnetization will remain reversible up to the upper critical field, estimated from the resistance measurements presented below to be 113 kOe at T=1.8 K. In contrast, the magnetization of the CS sample only becomes reversible in magnetic fields above 40 kOe [with H_{c2}(T=1.8K)\approx 130 kOe]. For lower fields the hysteresis loops of the CS sample contain a number of large magnetic-flux jumps, while no jumps are observed for the annealed samples. These flux jumps occur at lower temperatures (T\lesssim 4 K) and at applied fields below \sim20 kOe. The number and magnitude of the flux jumps vary from loop to loop and become less frequent as the field sweeping rate, dH/dt, is decreased (data not shown). At 5 K with (dH/dt\leqslant 10 Oe/s) no flux jumps are observed and at higher temperatures (5 K <T<T_{c}) the flux jumps disappear.

The M(H) curves show that both Re_{3}W phases exhibit reversible behavior below T_{c} over a large region of the H-T phase diagram. These data indicate that the bulk pinning is stronger in the CS phase of Re_{3}W than in the NCS phase, and that the flux jumps are due to thermomagnetic instabilities induced by the motion of vortices into the superconductor combined with the sudden redistribution of the vortices within the sample.[18] The symmetry of the loops suggests that surface barriers do not play an important role in determining the form of the magnetization loops in this material. Further studies are underway to investigate the different pinning mechanisms in the two different phases of Re_{3}W.

The value of the lower critical field, H_{c1}, was determined by measuring the field of first deviation from the initial slope of the magnetization curve. To this end, a linear fit to the data between 0 and 10 Oe was made. The deviation from linearity, \Delta M, was then calculated by subtracting this fit from the magnetization curves and plotted as a function of applied field [see Figs. 6(a) and 6(b)]. The temperature dependence of H_{c1} for the two phases of Re_{3}W are obtained by using the criterion \Delta M=10^{-4} emu/mol and plotted in Figs. 6(c) and 6(d). Demagnetizing effects are taken into account in estimating the H_{c1} values. The values determined for both samples are fitted using the expression H_{c1}(T)=H_{c1}(0)\{1-(T/T_{c})^{2}\}, where H_{c1}(0) is the lower critical field at zero temperature. The quadratic equation fits the data well for the NCS phase, whereas the model provides a poor fit to the data of the CS phase. The fits yield H_{c1}(0) of 97(1) and 279(11) Oe for the NCS and the CS samples, respectively.

  Resistivity measurements as a function of temperature were made in magnetic fields up to 90 kOe on both the NCS and the CS samples of Re_{3}W [see Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)]. In the normal state just above T_{c}, both phases exhibit a small (\sim0.6%) positive magnetoresistance in a magnetic field of 90 kOe. The temperature dependence of the upper critical field, H_{c2}(T), of the NCS and the CS samples, determined from the onset of the resistive transitions (defined by a 1% drop of the resistivity), are shown in Figs. 7(c) and 7(d). For the NCS sample, the temperature dependence of H_{c2} is nearly linear close to T_{c} with dH_{c2}^{\text{NCS}}/dT=-23.0(2) kOe/K and can be described using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) model.[19, 20] In fitting the data to the WHH relations we calculated the Maki parameter, \alpha=1.41, compared with a value of 1.22 estimated from the gradient dH_{c2}^{\text{NCS}}/dT near T_{c}. The WHH fit yields H_{c2}^{\text{NCS}}=125(1) kOe at T=0 K. The temperature dependence of H_{c2} for the CS sample clearly shows a difference in behavior compared to the NCS sample with deviations from the conventional WHH dependence. The data have a positive curvature with temperature near T_{c} and are linear thereafter. A similar behavior is observed in polycrystalline borocarbides,[21] MgB_{2},[22, 23] and Nb_{0.18}Re_{0.82}.[24] A reasonable fit to the data for the CS sample can be obtained using the expression H_{c2}(T)=H_{c2}(0)[1-(T/T_{c})^{3/2}]^{3/2} giving H_{c2}^{\text{CS}}(0)=147(3) kOe.[25] A simple linear extrapolation of the lower temperature data for T=0 K gives H_{c2}^{\text{CS}}(0)=178(5) kOe with dH_{c2}^{\text{CS}}/dT=-21(1) kOe/K. A similar analysis of the data for the NCS sample gives H_{c2}^{\text{NCS}}(0)=153(1) kOe. While the temperature dependence of H_{c2} for the two phases is clearly different, the values of H_{c2} at T=0 K are comparable. The analysis presented above shows that H_{c2}(0) appears to be slightly higher in the CS phase. Measurements at higher fields and lower temperatures are required to reveal to what extent Pauli limiting plays a role in determining H_{c2}(0) in these materials.

The coherence length \xi can be calculated using the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) relation \xi=(\Phi_{\circ}/2\pi\,H_{c2})^{1/2}, where \Phi_{\circ}=2.068\times 10^{-15} Wb is the flux quantum.[26] With H_{c2}^{\text{NCS}}(0)=125(1) kOe for NCS Re_{3}W, the estimated \xi^{\text{NCS}}(0) is 5.13(2) nm. For CS Re_{3}W, the value of \xi^{\text{CS}}(0) is deduced to be 4.73(5) nm from H_{c2}^{\text{CS}}(0)=147(3) kOe. Combining \xi and the standard expression H_{c1}=\frac{\Phi_{\circ}}{4\pi\lambda^{2}}(\ln\frac{\lambda}{\xi}+0.12),[27] we estimate the magnetic penetration depth, \lambda^{\text{NCS}}(0)=257(1) nm and \lambda^{\text{CS}}(0)=141(11) nm for the NCS and CS phases of Re_{3}W, respectively. The value of \lambda^{\text{NCS}}(0) is in good agreement with the value of 300(10) nm reported by Zuev _et al._.[11] We used the values of \lambda(0) and \xi(0) to calculate the GL parameter \kappa=\lambda/\xi. They yield \kappa^{\text{NCS}}(0)=50(1) for the NCS phase and \kappa^{\text{CS}}=30(3) for the CS phase of Re_{3}W. The measured and derived superconducting and transport parameters of the NCS and the CS phases of Re_{3}W are listed in Table 3.

## IV Summary

In summary, we have shown that there are two different phases of Re_{3}W. One phase is noncentrosymmetric with an \alpha-Mn structure and is superconducting with a T_{c} of 7.8 K. The other phase is centrosymmetric with a hexagonal structure and is also superconducting with a T_{c} of 9.4 K. Switching between the two phases is made possible by annealing (CS to NCS) or remelting (NCS to CS) the samples. The full hysteresis loops of the CS sample of Re_{3}W show giant flux jumps, while no jumps are observed for the NCS sample. The temperature dependence of H_{c2} of the NCS phase for Re_{3}W can be fitted using the WHH model which yields H_{c2}^{\text{NCS}}(0)=125(1) kOe. In contrast, H_{c2}(T) of the CS phase of Re_{3}W is linear at lower temperature and has a positive curvature nearer to T_{c}. A fit to the data gives H_{c2}^{\text{CS}}(0)=147(3) kOe. Using GL relations, the penetration depths are estimated to be \lambda^{\text{NCS}}=257(1) nm and \lambda^{\text{CS}}=141(11) nm and the coherence lengths are calculated to be \xi^{\text{NCS}}=5.13(1) nm and \xi^{\text{CS}}=4.73(1) nm at T=0 K. Our results compare well with unpublished work[12] on the NCS phase of Re_{3}W. To the best of our knowledge, Re_{3}W is the first system of its kind to be found to exist as either a centrosymmetric or a noncentrosymmetric superconducting material. This, and similar systems if they exist, offer a good opportunity to study the interplay between the structure, spin-orbit coupling, and superconducting properties of intermetallic systems.

###### Abstract

Two superconducting phases of Re_{3}W have been found with different physical properties. One phase crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric cubic (\alpha-Mn) structure and has a superconducting transition temperature T_{c} of 7.8 K. The other phase has a hexagonal centrosymmetric structure and is superconducting with a T_{c} of 9.4 K. Switching between the two phases is possible by annealing the sample or remelting it. The properties of both phases of Re_{3}W have been characterized by powder neutron diffraction, magnetization, and resistivity measurements. The temperature dependences of the lower and upper critical fields have been measured for both phases. These are used to determine the penetration depths and the coherence lengths for these systems.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) heavy fermion CePt_{3}Si (Ref. [1]) has resulted in a period of intense theoretical and experimental investigation into the physics of noncentrosymmetric superconducting materials. The lack of inversion symmetry in the crystal structure of this type of material along with strong spin-orbit (SO) coupling can lead to a mixing of spin-singlet and spin-triplet pair states.[2] These NCS materials exhibit unusual magnetic properties including suppressed paramagnetic limiting or high upper critical fields [3, 4] as seen in CePt_{3}Si,[1] CeRhSi_{3},[5] and CeIrSi_{3},[6] the appearance of superconductivity with antiferromagnet order in CePt_{3}Si,[7] and superconductivity at the border of ferromagnetism in UIr.[8]

One recent focus of the work on noncentrosymmetric superconductors has been to investigate the properties of transition-metal compounds that have a significant spin-orbit coupling. Here, the complications of the f-electron heavy fermions, such as the strong electron correlations and the possibility of magnetically mediated superconductivity, are expected to be absent. The intermetallic Re_{3}W belongs in this category since it contains heavy atoms with atomic numbers 75 and 74 for Re and W, respectively. Superconductivity in Re_{3}W was first reported in the 1960's. The material was shown to have a cubic \alpha-Mn structure,[9, 10] although it is worth noting that the authors of this early work did not comment on the fact that the \alpha-Mn structure is noncentrosymmetric. Since then, very little experimental work has been done on Re_{3}W. Recent penetration depth measurements carried out on the NCS phase of Re_{3}W by rf tunnel diode resonator and point-contact spectroscopy suggested that Re_{3}W is a weakly coupled isotropic s-wave superconductor.[11, 12, 13]

In this paper, we report on the synthesis of two different superconducting phases of Re_{3}W. One phase has a centrosymmetric (CS) crystal structure, whereas the other has a noncentrosymmetric structure. Switching from the CS to the NCS phase is achieved by annealing the sample, while remelting the NCS sample in an arc furnace returns the sample to the CS structure. The ease with which one can switch between the two phases of Re_{3}W has allowed us to investigate and compare the properties of a CS and a NCS superconducting system using a single material without changes in stoichiometry. We characterize the properties of both phases of Re_{3}W using neutron diffraction, magnetization M, and resistivity \rho measurements. We present the temperature dependence of the lower critical field, H_{c1}, and the upper critical field, H_{c2}, of both materials and also calculate the penetration depths and coherence lengths for these systems.

## II Sample preparation

Samples of the centrosymmetric phase of Re_{3}W were prepared by melting together a stoichiometric mixture of Re lumps (99.99%) and W pieces (99.999%) in an arc furnace on a water-cooled copper hearth using tungsten electrodes in a high-purity Ar atmosphere. After the initial melt, the buttons were turned and remelted several times to ensure homogeneity. Samples of the noncentrosymmetric phase were made by annealing the as-grown samples for 5 days at 1500^{\circ}C in a high-purity Ar atmosphere. The unannealed samples of Re_{3}W are hard but malleable. The samples become brittle after annealing.

## III Results and discussion

### Powder neutron diffraction studies

Time-of-flight powder neutron diffraction data were collected on the General Materials Diffractometer (GEM) at the ISIS facility in the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK.[14] The data were normalized to the incident neutron flux distribution and corrected for detector efficiencies and detector solid angle coverage, with the diffraction patterns collected in the highest resolution backscattering detector bank (average 2\theta = 154^{\circ}) used for structure refinement. Crystal structures were refined by the Rietveld method using the expgui graphical interface for the gsas package.[15, 16] Figure 1 shows the diffraction patterns collected at 295 K from the annealed and unannealed samples of Re_{3}W. The Rietveld refinement shows that the annealed sample has a cubic NCS (\alpha-Mn) structure (space group I\bar{4}3m) with a lattice parameter a = 9.5987(7) A [see Fig. 1(a)]. The diffraction pattern of the unannealed sample shows that this sample has a hexagonal structure with the CS space group P6_{3}/mmc and lattice parameters a = 2.770(3) A and c = 4.5207(6) A [see Fig. 1(b)]. The diffraction patterns of both phases of Re_{3}W contain some peaks (denoted by asterisks) that cannot be indexed, and these regions were excluded during the final stages of structure refinement. Insets of Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) show the crystal structures of the NCS and the CS phases of Re_{3}W. For the CS phase of Re_{3}W, both the Re and the W atoms share the same site, leading to a random distribution of Re and W within the material. For the NCS phase, the refinement indicates that Re and the W atoms occupy preferred crystallographic sites and are therefore distributed in a more orderly fashion within the material. The refined composition of the NCS phase is not stoichiometric indicating there is still some uncertainty in the site occupation. Crystallographic parameters of the two phases of Re_{3}W are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

### Magnetization and resistivity measurements

Magnetization measurements were made as a function temperature in an applied magnetic field of 20 Oe using a Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS) magnetometer. The temperature dependence of the dc magnetic susceptibility, \chi_{\rm dc}(T), shows that the NCS Re_{3}W sample has a superconducting transition temperature, T_{c}^{\rm onset}, of 7.8 K (see Fig. 2) with a transition width \Delta T_{c}=0.21 K. For CS Re_{3}W, the onset of the transition is around 9.4 K with a much broader transition of \Delta T_{c}=0.50 K. Comparable transition widths are observed in the resistivity measurements (see below). This suggests, as expected, that the annealed NCS phase of Re_{3}W is more ordered than the unannealed CS phase. At 2 K, the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) dc susceptibility approaches a value of -1 (\sim100% shielding effect) for both the samples, while the field-cooled (FC) signal shows a flux exclusion (Meissner effect) of \sim5% for the NCS phase and \sim7% for the CS phase.

The ac electrical resistivity was measured as a function of temperature, \rho(T), for both phases of Re_{3}W via a standard four-probe method using a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) (see Fig. 3). The NCS Re_{3}W shows a superconducting transition (onset) at 7.85 K (\Delta T_{c}=0.05 K) while the CS Re_{3}W has a transition at 9.45 K (\Delta T_{c}=0.32 K). The zero-field onset transition temperatures determined from the resistivity measurements are slightly higher than those obtained from the magnetization measurements performed in 20 Oe.

  between 2 and 295 K show metallic behavior for the CS phase of Re_{3}W, whereas it is almost temperature independent above T_{c} in the NCS phase of Re_{3}W (see the inset of Fig. 3). The relative resistance ratio \rho(295K)/\rho(10K) and the room temperature resistivity are 1.15(1) and 1.7\mu\Omega m for the NCS phase and 1.52(1) and 2.1\mu\Omega m for the CS phase, indicating that both samples are poor metals. The NCS phase is the more brittle of the two materials and any extrinsic factors such as microscopic cracks in the sample are more likely to play a role in this material. Given that the room temperature resistivity of the NCS sample is lower than the CS phase we suggest that cracks are not the reason for the high normal-state resistivity. The poor conductivity is more likely to result from a combination of strong electronic scattering and a large temperature-independent residual resistivity due to structural disorder (while the NCS annealed phase is structurally more ordered than the CS phase, the NCS phase still retains a degree of Re/W disorder). We have calculated the mean free path, l_{\text{tr}}, based on the BCS approach [17] using the room temperature resistivity data. The calculations yield l_{\text{tr}}^{\text{NCS}} = 0.277 nm and l_{\text{tr}}^{\text{CS}} = 0.224 nm. These values are comparable with the size of the crystallographic unit cells and given the coherence lengths \xi, derived below, indicate that both phases of Re_{3}W are in the dirty limit.

Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the low-field virgin magnetization data for the NCS and CS phases of Re_{3}W at 1.8 K and Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) show the full magnetization versus applied magnetic field loops collected in the superconducting state at 1.8 K. For the NCS sample the raw M(H) data contain a significant paramagnetic contribution. This contribution

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c} NCS & Re_{3}W & & & & & \\ Atom & Site & x & y & z & Occ. & U_{\text{iso}} (Å^{2}) \\ Re & 2a & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.99(4) & 0.070(5) \\ W & 8c & 0.3192(3) & 0.3192(3) & 0.3192(3) & 1.00 & 0.0068(7) \\ W & 24g & 0.3605(1) & 0.3605(1) & 0.0455(1) & 0.21(2) & 0.0090(3) \\ Re & 24g & 0.3605(1) & 0.3  has been removed from the data shown in Fig. 5(a) by measuring an M(H) curve above T_{c} at 10 K [see inset of Fig. 5(a)]. The signal for the CS sample contains a small linear susceptibility \chi_{\rm dc}=3.53\times 10^{-3} emu/mol [see inset of Fig. 5(b)] that has been subtracted from the data shown in figure 5(b). For the NCS sample, the value of H_{\rm P} (complete penetration of the magnetic field) is 152 Oe, while in the CS sample, H_{\rm P}>2500 Oe. For the NCS phase of Re_{3}W the magnetization is reversible all the way from 70 kOe, the highest field that we can apply in our magnetometer, down to 10 kOe. We presume that the magnetization will remain reversible up to the upper critical field, estimated from the resistance measurements presented below to be 113 kOe at T=1.8 K. In contrast, the magnetization of the CS sample only becomes reversible in magnetic fields above 40 kOe [with H_{c2}(T=1.8K)\approx 130 kOe]. For lower fields the hysteresis loops of the CS sample contain a number of large magnetic-flux jumps, while no jumps are observed for the annealed samples. These flux jumps occur at lower temperatures (T\lesssim 4 K) and at applied fields below \sim20 kOe. The number and magnitude of the flux jumps vary from loop to loop and become less frequent as the field sweeping rate, dH/dt, is decreased (data not shown). At 5 K with (dH/dt\leqslant 10 Oe/s) no flux jumps are observed and at higher temperatures (5 K <T<T_{c}) the flux jumps disappear.

The M(H) curves show that both Re_{3}W phases exhibit reversible behavior below T_{c} over a large region of the H-T phase diagram. These data indicate that the bulk pinning is stronger in the CS phase of Re_{3}W than in the NCS phase, and that the flux jumps are due to thermomagnetic instabilities induced by the motion of vortices into the superconductor combined with the sudden redistribution of the vortices within the sample.[18] The symmetry of the loops suggests that surface barriers do not play an important role in determining the form of the magnetization loops in this material. Further studies are underway to investigate the different pinning mechanisms in the two different phases of Re_{3}W.

The value of the lower critical field, H_{c1}, was determined by measuring the field of first deviation from the initial slope of the magnetization curve. To this end, a linear fit to the data between 0 and 10 Oe was made. The deviation from linearity, \Delta M, was then calculated by subtracting this fit from the magnetization curves and plotted as a function of applied field [see Figs. 6(a) and 6(b)]. The temperature dependence of H_{c1} for the two phases of Re_{3}W are obtained by using the criterion \Delta M=10^{-4} emu/mol and plotted in Figs. 6(c) and 6(d). Demagnetizing effects are taken into account in estimating the H_{c1} values. The values determined for both samples are fitted using the expression H_{c1}(T)=H_{c1}(0)\{1-(T/T_{c})^{2}\}, where H_{c1}(0) is the lower critical field at zero temperature. The quadratic equation fits the data well for the NCS phase, whereas the model provides a poor fit to the data of the CS phase. The fits yield H_{c1}(0) of 97(1) and 279(11) Oe for the NCS and the CS samples, respectively.

  Resistivity measurements as a function of temperature were made in magnetic fields up to 90 kOe on both the NCS and the CS samples of Re_{3}W [see Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)]. In the normal state just above T_{c}, both phases exhibit a small (\sim0.6%) positive magnetoresistance in a magnetic field of 90 kOe. The temperature dependence of the upper critical field, H_{c2}(T), of the NCS and the CS samples, determined from the onset of the resistive transitions (defined by a 1% drop of the resistivity), are shown in Figs. 7(c) and 7(d). For the NCS sample, the temperature dependence of H_{c2} is nearly linear close to T_{c} with dH_{c2}^{\text{NCS}}/dT=-23.0(2) kOe/K and can be described using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) model.[19, 20] In fitting the data to the WHH relations we calculated the Maki parameter, \alpha=1.41, compared with a value of 1.22 estimated from the gradient dH_{c2}^{\text{NCS}}/dT near T_{c}. The WHH fit yields H_{c2}^{\text{NCS}}=125(1) kOe at T=0 K. The temperature dependence of H_{c2} for the CS sample clearly shows a difference in behavior compared to the NCS sample with deviations from the conventional WHH dependence. The data have a positive curvature with temperature near T_{c} and are linear thereafter. A similar behavior is observed in polycrystalline borocarbides,[21] MgB_{2},[22, 23] and Nb_{0.18}Re_{0.82}.[24] A reasonable fit to the data for the CS sample can be obtained using the expression H_{c2}(T)=H_{c2}(0)[1-(T/T_{c})^{3/2}]^{3/2} giving H_{c2}^{\text{CS}}(0)=147(3) kOe.[25] A simple linear extrapolation of the lower temperature data for T=0 K gives H_{c2}^{\text{CS}}(0)=178(5) kOe with dH_{c2}^{\text{CS}}/dT=-21(1) kOe/K. A similar analysis of the data for the NCS sample gives H_{c2}^{\text{NCS}}(0)=153(1) kOe. While the temperature dependence of H_{c2} for the two phases is clearly different, the values of H_{c2} at T=0 K are comparable. The analysis presented above shows that H_{c2}(0) appears to be slightly higher in the CS phase. Measurements at higher fields and lower temperatures are required to reveal to what extent Pauli limiting plays a role in determining H_{c2}(0) in these materials.

The coherence length \xi can be calculated using the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) relation \xi=(\Phi_{\circ}/2\pi\,H_{c2})^{1/2}, where \Phi_{\circ}=2.068\times 10^{-15} Wb is the flux quantum.[26] With H_{c2}^{\text{NCS}}(0)=125(1) kOe for NCS Re_{3}W, the estimated \xi^{\text{NCS}}(0) is 5.13(2) nm. For CS Re_{3}W, the value of \xi^{\text{CS}}(0) is deduced to be 4.73(5) nm from H_{c2}^{\text{CS}}(0)=147(3) kOe. Combining \xi and the standard expression H_{c1}=\frac{\Phi_{\circ}}{4\pi\lambda^{2}}(\ln\frac{\lambda}{\xi}+0.12),[27] we estimate the magnetic penetration depth, \lambda^{\text{NCS}}(0)=257(1) nm and \lambda^{\text{CS}}(0)=141(11) nm for the NCS and CS phases of Re_{3}W, respectively. The value of \lambda^{\text{NCS}}(0) is in good agreement with the value of 300(10) nm reported by Zuev _et al._.[11] We used the values of \lambda(0) and \xi(0) to calculate the GL parameter \kappa=\lambda/\xi. They yield \kappa^{\text{NCS}}(0)=50(1) for the NCS phase and \kappa^{\text{CS}}=30(3) for the CS phase of Re_{3}W. The measured and derived superconducting and transport parameters of the NCS and the CS phases of Re_{3}W are listed in Table 3.

## IV Summary

In summary, we have shown that there are two different phases of Re_{3}W. One phase is noncentrosymmetric with an \alpha-Mn structure and is superconducting with a T_{c} of 7.8 K. The other phase is centrosymmetric with a hexagonal structure and is also superconducting with a T_{c} of 9.4 K. Switching between the two phases is made possible by annealing (CS to NCS) or remelting (NCS to CS) the samples. The full hysteresis loops of the CS sample of Re_{3}W show giant flux jumps, while no jumps are observed for the NCS sample. The temperature dependence of H_{c2} of the NCS phase for Re_{3}W can be fitted using the WHH model which yields H_{c2}^{\text{NCS}}(0)=125(1) kOe. In contrast, H_{c2}(T) of the CS phase of Re_{3}W is linear at lower temperature and has a positive curvature nearer to T_{c}. A fit to the data gives H_{c2}^{\text{CS}}(0)=147(3) kOe. Using GL relations, the penetration depths are estimated to be \lambda^{\text{NCS}}=257(1) nm and \lambda^{\text{CS}}=141(11) nm and the coherence lengths are calculated to be \xi^{\text{NCS}}=5.13(1) nm and \xi^{\text{CS}}=4.73(1) nm at T=0 K. Our results compare well with unpublished work[12] on the NCS phase of Re_{3}W. To the best of our knowledge, Re_{3}W is the first system of its kind to be found to exist as either a centrosymmetric or a noncentrosymmetric superconducting material. This, and similar systems if they exist, offer a good opportunity to study the interplay between the structure, spin-orbit coupling, and superconducting properties of intermetallic systems.
