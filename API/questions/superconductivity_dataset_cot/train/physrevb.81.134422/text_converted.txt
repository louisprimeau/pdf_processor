###### Abstract

We performed a systematic study on the properties of CeFeAs1-xPxO (0 <=
x <= 1) by electrical resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat
measurements. The _c_-axis lattice constant decreases significantly with
increasing P content, suggesting a remarkable chemical pressure. The
_c_-3d electrons show the enhanced metallic behavior upon P doping and
undergo a magnetic quantum phase transition around x   0.4. Meanwhile,
the Ce 4f electrons develop a ferromagnetic order near the same doping
level. The ferromagnetic order is vanishingly small around x = 0.9. The
data suggest a heavy-fermionlike behavior as x = 0.95. No
superconductivity is observed down to 2 K. Our results show the
ferromagnetic ordered state as an intermediate phase intruding between
the antiferromagnetic bad metal and the nonmagnetic heavy-fermion metal
and support the cerium-containing iron pnictides as a unique layered
Kondo lattice system.

## I Introduction

The homologous quaternary iron pnictides, R Fe XO, (_R_: rare earths,
_X_: As or P) show a diversity of physical properties although they have
the same ZrCuSiAs-type crystal structure with a unique Fe X layer
sandwiched by the _R_O layer.[1] Typically, LaFeAsO is an
antiferromagnetic (AFM) metal below 140 K and is a superconductor (SC)
with maximal _T_c = 26 K upon F doping.[2]T_(c) can be surprisingly
increased up to 41 K when La is replaced by Ce (Ref. [3]) or even higher
if replaced by other rare earths.[4, 5, 6] Meanwhile, the parent
compounds (denoted as Ln-1111) of these SC’s, such as CeFeAsO, are still
Fe 3d itinerant AFM’s similar to LaFeAsO. However, a noticeable
_f_-electron AFM ordering of Ce3+ is also observed at a much lower
temperature ( 4 K).[3] On the other hand, the stoichiometric LaFePO is a
low-_T_c SC without any trace of the AFM ordering.[7, 8] By contrast,
CeFePO is a heavy-fermion (HF) metal with Kondo temperature _T_K   10
K.[9]

These discoveries put the rare-earth iron pnictides on the boundary
between the high-_T_c superconductors[10] and the heavy-fermion
metals,[11] and open an avenue for searching the complicated interplay
of various _d_- and _f_-electron correlations. Within the iron-pnictogen
layer, the d electrons are expected to be more itinerant in the
phosphides than in the arsenides,[12, 13] with the former being recently
identified as a moderately correlated metal.[14] In contrast to the
cuprates, the interlayer distance between the transition metals and the
rare earths in the iron pnictides is critically significant so that the
coupling between them may play an important role even in the parent
compounds of the high-_T_c Fe-based SC’s.[15] Recent neutron-scattering
and muon-spin-relaxation experiments indeed provide evidence for a
sizable interlayer coupling in CeFeAsO.[16, 17] So far it is still
unclear whether this coupling is due to some kind of polarization effect
raised by the ordered moment of Fe2+ ions[17] or more microscopically
the effective hybridization between the 3d and 4f orbitals bridged by
the pnictogens.[15] A first-principle local-density approximation (LDA)
plus dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) study[18] suggested that
applying a physical pressure will enhance the _d_-_f_ hybridization,
leading to the Kondo screening of the Ce moments. However a sufficiently
high pressure is required in order to observe this effect. It turns out
that CeFeAs1-xPxO, i.e., P doping at As sites in CeFeAsO, may provide,
among others, a unique layered Kondo lattice system to probe the
intriguing 3_d_-4f electron interplay under ambient pressure.[15]
Chemical-pressure-induced superconductivity has been observed in P-doped
LaFeAsO.[19]

We report a systematic study on the doping evolution of the physical
properties of CeFeAs1-xPxO using electrical resistivity ρ(_T_), magnetic
susceptibility χ(_T_), isothermal magnetization M(_H_), and specific
heat C(_T_) measurements. A series of 21 different P-doped
polycrystalline samples were synthesized. Our results reveal a rich
phase diagram consisting of an AFM quantum critical point (QCP) of the
Fe 3d electrons and a possible ferromagnetic (FM) QCP of the Ce 4f
electrons. An intermediate FM phase emerges in between the AFM bad metal
and the nonmagnetic HF metal. Because P doping does not introduce extra
electrons but shortens the c axis significantly, these findings provide
a rare example of chemical-pressure-induced HF metals with strong FM
fluctuations.

## II Experimental

We synthesized a series of CeFeAs1-xPxO (0 <= x <= 1) polycrystalline
samples by solid-state reaction, during which, Ce, Fe, As, P, and CeO2
of high purity (>=99.95

Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed at room temperature using a
D/Max-rA diffractometer with Cu _K_a radiation and a graphite
monochromator. Lattice parameters were refined by a least-squares fit
using at least 30 XRD peaks and the structural refinements were
performed using the program rietan 2000. The dc magnetization
measurement was carried out in a Quantum Design magnetic property
measurement system (MPMS-5). Physical property measurement system
(PPMS-9) was used to take the resistivity measurement, as well as
specific heat.

## III. Results and Discussion

The room-temperature powder XRD patterns of CeFeAs_(1 − x)P_(x)O are
shown in Fig. 1. All the XRD peaks can be well indexed based on the
tetragonal ZrCuSiAs-type structure with the space group P4/_nmm_ (No.
129), and no obvious impurity phases can be detected, suggesting high
quality of the samples. As shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), the XRD peaks
shift toward right hand, especially for the high angle reflections. The
(003) peaks shift much faster than the (110) peaks so that they merge
into one peak in the high-doping case, indicating that the c axis
shrinks more severely than the a axis. This observation is consistent
with the lattice-parameter calculation results shown in Fig. 1(c).
Figures 1(d) and 1(e) present the Rietveld refinement profiles for the
two end members CeFeAsO and CeFePO, which give details of the crystal
structure. The remarkable differences in structure lie in the positions
of Ce and As/P. For CeFePO, the thickness of FeP layers is much smaller,
meanwhile, Ce atomic layers are much closer to the FeP layers. This
structural feature supports the strong coupling between Fe 3d and Ce 4f
electrons.

The temperature-dependent resistivity is shown in Fig. 2, where four
prominent features can be identified. (i) The overall suppression of the
room-temperature resistivity with increasing doping. The resistivity at
_T_=300 K decreases gradually from 300 _m_d_O m for _x_=0 to 12 _m_d_O m
for _x_=1, indicating that P doping enhances the metallic behavior
significantly. (ii) The resistivity anomaly, mostly pronounced for
_x_=0. This anomaly was ascribed to the structure distortion and the
accompanied Fe-AFM transition.[20, 21] Upon doping, the anomaly is
suppressed monotonically and soon becomes an unremarkable kink at lower
temperatures. No clear kink can be identified for x > 0.3. The
suppression of this anomaly with P doping is consistent with the
suppression of AFM order of Fe ions, which is confirmed by a recent
neutron study.[22] We mark arrows in Fig. 2(a) to show the Fe-AFM
transition (_T__N_1, data from Ref. 22). (iii) The resistivity upturn at
low temperatures for x ≤ 0.4. The upturn behavior is suppressed by
doping or magnetic field, see the inset of Fig. 2(b). (iv) The metallic
behavior in the entire measured temperature range for x > 0.4. In
particular, the resistivity drops rapidly at low temperatures for larger
x. Such a drop in resistivity has already been observed in the HF metal
CeFePO in the previous report.[9] However, no SC is observed down to T =
2 K for the entire P-doping range.

It should be noted that the value of resistivity itself may not reflect
the polycrystalline sample’s quality. Actually the most likely impurity
phases in the Ln-1111 pnictides could be FeAs or Fe₂As, and Ln₂O₃. Both
FeAs and Fe₂As are highly metallic, more metallic than CeFeAsO itself at
low temperatures. The metallic impurity phase such as FeAs

and CeFePO. The refined atomic coordinates (_x_, y, _z_) are: Ce (0.25,

0.6547) for CeFeAsO; and Ce (0.25, 0.25, 0.1508), O (0.75, 0.25, 0), Fe
(0.75, 0.25, 0.5), P (0.25, 0.25, 0.6384) for CeFePO.

could distribute most likely in the grain boundaries and thus result in
a lower resistivity if the main phase is a bad metal. The intrinsic
resistivity behavior of Ln-1111 parent pnictides below the Fe-AFM order
is still ambiguous. For example, the resistivity of single crystal of
LaFeAsO shows an upturn at low temperatures,[23] meanwhile the
resistivity of both polycrystalline and single-crystalline CeFeAsO
samples shows clear metallic behavior.[34] However, our more than 20
CeFeAs_(1 − x)P_(x)O samples with different P content were prepared
under same conditions and the XRD patterns show that they all are of
same high purity, the systematic decrease in resistivity indeed suggests
the increasing metallicity with increasing P content.

The temperature dependence of dc magnetic susceptibility is shown in
Fig. 3. In the high-temperature range, χ(T) increases with decreasing
temperature down to 150 K following a Curie-Weiss law for all 0 ≤ x≤ 1.
The derived effective moment μ_(eff) is 2.54μ_(B) for x = 0, and
2.56μ_(B) for x = 1 [insets of Fig. 3], very close to that of a free
Ce³⁺ ion, 2.54μ_(B). By lowering temperatures, a clear peak was observed
at 4.16 K for x = 0, related to the formation of the Ce³⁺ AFM order.
With increasing x, χ(T) increases and the peak becomes round (or
shoulderlike); meanwhile the corresponding AFM ordering temperature does
not change too much. For x≥ 0.4, an obvious divergence between
zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) is seen at lower
temperatures [see Fig. 3(b)], manifesting the FM ordered ground state of
the Ce 4f electrons. The suppression of AFM and development of FM are
consistent with the enhanced metallic transport behavior in the course
of P doping. The FM ordered state persists until x ∼ 0.9 where the
divergency of χ(T) vanishes.

The evolution of Ce³⁺ magnetism can be further demonstrated by
isothermal field-dependent magnetization measurements, which are shown
in Fig. 4. The temperatures are fixed at 2 K and 10 K, respectively. For
x = 0 and T = 2 K, a kink in the magnetization curve is clearly seen,
indicating a possible spin flop in the AFM state of Ce³⁺. When x
increases the kink becomes weaker. As x ≥ 0.4, M(H) starts to increase
rapidly for small fields and tends to saturate at higher fields, i.e.,
it exhibits a nonlinear field dependence, see Fig. 4(d) for x = 0.4. For
0.5 ≤ x < 0.9, a clear hysteresis loop can be observed and the saturated
M value reaches the maximum around x = 0.6 [see Fig. 4(e)]. Therefore,
the long-range FM order exists in a wide doping range in between x∼ 0.4
and x ∼ 0.9. The largest saturated magnetic moment is about 0.95μ_(B),
close to 1μ_(B) expected for a Ce³⁺ doublet ground state.[9, 16] For 0.9
≤ x< 0.95 the hysteresis loop is hardly observable down to the lowest
measured temperature while the saturation tendency persists. This may be
due to strong FM fluctuations at the quantum critical point associated
with the 4f electrons. On the other hand, both the susceptibility and
magnetization show a nonmagnetic HF-like phase for x ≥ 0.95 [see Figs.
3(b), 4(g), and 4(h)], consistent with the resistivity measurement.

The metallic HF-like behavior can be further manifested by the specific
heat measurement as shown in Fig. 5. For x =0.95, 0.97, and 1, the
specific heat coefficient γ(T) = C(T)/T shows −log T behavior at low
temperatures down to 2 K, see the inset of Fig. 5. We define a
characteristic temperature T_(γ) (below which HF-like behavior appears)
as the intersection of two extrapolate lines of the specific heat data.
For the x = 1 sample, T_(γ)∼ 8.6 K. The saturated γ should be about
700−800 mJ/mol K² or larger, in agreement with the result of Ref. [9],
where γ increases in proportion to −log T before it gets saturated below
1 K. As a comparison, γ(T) shows a λ peak maximized around 4.2 K and

6.8 K in the AFM and FM ordered phases, for x = 0 and 0.8, respectively,
in agreement with the magnetization measurement. A sudden increase in
the saturated g close to x   0.9 can be inferred by the values of
_g_(_T_ = 2 K), accompanied by a decrease in the saturated magnetization
under _m_d_H = 5 T. This implies the enhancement of the Kondo screening
near the FM instability. It should be noted that a very tiny kink was
observed around 6 K on the _C_/_T_-_T_ curve of x = 0.95. We ascribe
this additional peak to the contribution from some impurities with lower
P content. Roughly estimated from the intensity of the kink, the amount
of the impurity phase should be less than 2

We summarize the experimental results by suggesting an electronic phase
diagram shown in Fig. 6. At low temperatures, both the Fe 3d and Ce 4f
electrons show the long-range AFM ordering for x <= 0.37. The d
electrons are Pauli paramagnetic (PM) for x >= 0.4 while the f electrons
are FM ordered until x   0.9. For x >= 0.95, the f moments are
completely quenched and the whole system becomes a nonmagnetic HF-like
metal. The HF-like region is roughly depicted by _T_g. Therefore, in
addition to the first magnetic QCP (denoted by _x_c_1) associated with
the AFM-PM transitions of the d electrons, there could be another QCP
associated with the FM-HF transition of f electrons around x of 0.92
(denoted by _x_c_2). _x_c_1 has been known to be 0.4 by the study of
neutron scattering. [22] A turning point (denoted by _x_c_2) associated
with the AFM-FM transition of the f electrons at _x_c_3 0.37 is quite
close to _x_c_1. Meanwhile the strong FM fluctuations show up in the
vicinity of _x_c_2.

It should be noticed that the transition temperatures of the Fe-AFM
ordering and the structure distortion can be ap

proximately determined from the resistivity anomaly as shown in Fig. 2
and neutron studies.[22] They are undistinguishable in resistivity when
x>0.2. The neutron study[22] revealed that both of them are suppressed
at x_(_(c₁))∼0.4, confirming an early theoretical prediction for the
existence of a unique magnetic QCP driven by P doping.[25] Moreover, the
d-electron QCP seems to be very close to the turning point (x_(_(c₃)))
of the f electrons. This fact may indicate that the d-electron magnetic
transition is of weak first order accompanied by a reconstruction of the
electronic states across x_(_(c₁)). It is not certain if the coincidence
implies the AFM ordering in Ce subsystem being supported by the AFM
order in the Fe plane because the ordering patterns of the two
subsystems are different and the f-electron AFM order can coexist with
the d-electron SC order in the F-doping case.[3, 20] Besides this
puzzling feature, other implications of our experimental results should
be addressed as follows.

First, as the suppression of the a axis is only a fraction of that of
the c axis upon P doping, the electronic states within the Ce-O layer
should not change significantly. This is also supported by the
nonmagnetic LDA calculation from which the different Fermi surfaces of
CeFeAsO and CeFePO can be mainly ascribed to the pnictogen height.[18,
26] Therefore the HF behavior in the end compound, CeFePO, is originated
unambiguously from the interlayer coupling between the Fe 3d and Ce 4f
electrons. Second, the f-electron AFM-FM transition could be explained
by assuming the existence of a bare d-f Kondo coupling (J_(K)) in the
ordered phases, as it can mediate the indirect
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction ($J_{\rm RKKY}$)
between the Ce 4f local moments. Intuitively, the exchange interaction
between the local f spins, J_(f), is given by
J_(f)=J⃗_(f)⁽⁰⁾+$J_{\rm RKKY}$, with J_(f)⁽⁰⁾ being the exchange
interaction in the absence of J_(K) and $|J_{\rm RKKY}|$ ∼ J_(K)²N_(F),
with N_(F) being the density of states (DOS) at Fermi level (of mainly
d-electron characteristic). $J_{\rm RKKY}$ is negative if N_(F) is
small, as it should be since the parent compound CeFeAsO is a bad
metal.[12, 13] Upon P doping, both J_(K) and N_(F) should increase,
leading to a sign change in J_(f). Third, the negative J_(f) is also the
driving force for the strong FM fluctuations in the vicinity of the
critical point x_(_(c₂)), where the Kondo scale T_(K) (which increases
exponentially with J_(K)N_(F)) starts to dominate over the magnetic
ordering energy scale, T_(f)= |J_(f)|.

It is well established that the RKKY interaction between the local
moments is mediated by the Kondo coupling between the itinerant charge
carries and local moments.[27, 28] The Kondo coupling can lead to both
the Kondo effect and the RKKY interaction with the latter being
responsible to the magnetic ordering of the local moments. The crucial
point is that the dependences on the Kondo coupling (together with the
DOS of the charge carries) of the Kondo energy scale (describing the
Kondo effect) and of the RKKY interaction (characterizing the ordering
temperature of the local moments) are different, as described by the
intuitive formulas in the inset of Fig. 6. Based on the similar
intuitive formulas, Doniach first suggested that a quantum phase
transition from magnetic ordering phase to the paramagnetic HF phase
could exist in a Kondo lattice.[27] Here, we suggest that the AFM-FM-HF
evolution of the f electrons in CeFeAs_(1 − x)P_(x)O is due to the
competition between T_(K) and J_(f) (instead of $J_{\rm RKKY}$ in the
conventional Kondo lattice[11]), see the inset of Fig. 6. Notice that
J_(f)⁽⁰⁾ is positive and relatively small in the absence of
$J_{\rm RKKY}$. Thus in the AFM phase T_(K) is mainly suppressed by the
AFM ordering gap of the d electrons.[15] This picture provides a natural
explanation for the strong FM fluctuations in a class of homologous HF
compounds including CeFePO (Ref. [9]) and CeRuPO.[29, 30] Therefore the
observed f-electron phase diagram of CeFeAs_(1 − x)P_(x)O system is
consistent with the Doniach picture.[27] In addition, it also predicts a
possible weak Kondo phase in a narrow doping region enclosing the
turning point x_(_(c₃)) (at very low temperatures). As x_(_(c₃)) is very
close to x_(_(c₁)), it may account for the observed suppression of the
SC near the AFM QCP. The existence of this peculiar phase and its
possible connection with the transport and magnetic properties still
need to be clarified.

## IV Conclusion

In summary, our experimental study on CeFeAs_(1 − x)P_(x)O (0≤x≤1)
reveals a rich phase diagram which consists of an AFM quantum phase
transition of the Fe 3d electrons and an AFM-FM-HF evolution of the Ce
4f electrons. The AFM QCP of the d electrons is very close to the
turning point of the AFM-FM transition of the f electrons while the d-f
hybridized HF state is separated by an f-electron FM instability. In
contrast to the F-doping case where the high-T_(c) SC is induced, no SC
is observed down to 2 K in the present case, signaling the unique role
of P doping in suppressing the d-electron correlation.[13, 25] These
results highlight the importance of the interlayer Kondo physics[15, 31]
and the interplay of the d- and f-electron correlations in the
rare-earth iron pnictides.
