###### Abstract

Electronic structure of newly synthesized single crystals of calcium
iron arsenide doped with sodium with $T_{\rm c}$ ranging from 33 to 14 K
has been determined by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES). The measured band dispersion is in general agreement with
theoretical calculations, nonetheless implies absence of Fermi-surface
nesting at an antiferromagnetic vector. A clearly developing below
$T_{\rm c}$ strongly band-dependant superconducting gap has been
revealed for samples with various doping levels. The BCS ratio for
optimal doping, $2\Delta/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=5.5$, is substantially
smaller than the numbers observed for related compounds.

Figure 2 shows temperature-dependent measurements, revealing the opening
of the superconducting gap in the photoemission spectra. The
energy-momentum cut, shown in Fig. 2(a), captures Fermi crossings of the
inner and outer Γ barrels. The bending of the band dispersion is seen
for both outer and inner Γ barrels with a stronger effect for the
latter. Figure 2(b) shows the temperature dependence of the partial
density of states, exhibiting growth of the coherence peak below
$T_{\rm c}$. Partial density of states for the inner band measured at 1
K is shown in the Fig. 2(c) with a fit to the Dynes function.[7, 19]
Fitting yields a gap value of 7.8 meV. Corresponding analysis for the
outer band yields a gap magnitude of 2.3 meV (d). A noticeable
nonsuperconducting component is present in the photoemission spectra,
similar to the case of the hole-doped BaFe₂As₂.[4, 7, 8]

Figure 2(e) shows energy-momentum cuts recorded at hv = 25 eV along ΓX
and ΓΓ directions. While there is virtually no difference between these
directions for the gap on the inner Γ barrel, the back-bending
dispersion, which is a signature of a gap, at the outer Γ barrel is
substantially more pronounced for the ΓΓ direction. Further analysis of
$k_{\rm F}$ energy distribution curves (EDCs) [see Figs. 2(f) and 2(g)]
shows that the spectrum for the ΓΓ direction is shifted further from the
Fermi level, as compared to ΓX, suggesting that the superconducting gap
at the outer Γ barrel is anisotropic with minima along the
Brillouin-zone diagonal, ΓX line. Though this anisotropy is rather weak
and generally is within error bars of experiment, several data sets
indicate that it is as described

above: for the outer Γ FS sheet the gap is smaller along Γ X and the
modulation magnitude is comparable to the gap size, as opposed to the
inner Γ FS sheet, for which the modulation is much smaller than the gap
size itself.

Figure 2(h) shows the temperature dependence of the electronlike X
pocket. Flattening of the spectrum top below $T_{\rm c}$ indicates
opening of the superconducting gap here. Figure 2(i) shows a
high-temperature spectrum of the X pocket divided by the Fermi function,
clearly confirming the electronlike nature of these FS sheets. Even
better the onset of superconductivity is seen in Fig. 2(j), where the
partial DOS for the X pocket is presented: the peak grows below
$T_{\rm c}$ and the leading edge shifts towards higher binding energies.
Spectra, taken from the inner Γ barrel and propeller blades at the same
conditions, indicate a uniform gap for the entire propeller structure
[see Fig. 2(k)]. Additionally the electronic states of the
above-mentioned 3z² − 1 band at (k_(x) = 0, k_(y) = 0) exhibit a clearly
noticeable response to the superconducting transition with a gap
comparable to the one found for the outer Γ barrel. The in-plane
momentum dependence of the superconducting gap is summarized in Fig.
2(l). The found in CNFA momentum distribution of the superconducting gap
is

very similar to the one that has been observed in BKFA,[7; 8] except for
the suggested large relative variation of the gap function for the outer
Γ barrel. The dependence of the gap on the out-of-plane electron
momentum has been also measured, and is generally similar to those
previously reported for BKFA[8] and BaFe₂As_(2 − 2x)P_(2z).[20] sharp
minima in the gap as a function of k_(z) occur at the Z point, where the
d_(3z² − 1) band interacts with d_(z²/z) bands of Γ barrels. The
gap-to-$T_{\rm c}$ ratio, found here for CNFA,
$2\Delta_{\rm max}/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=5.5$, clearly exceeds the
universal BCS value, however is substantially smaller than the values of
$T_{\rm c}$.

found for other iron-based superconductors. For example, for the related
compound BKFA, gap-to-$T_{\rm c}$ ratios of 6.3, [8], 7.8, [4] and even
9.5 (Ref. [21]) were reported. For Sm-1111 with $T_{\rm c}$ of 52 K,
close to the record among iron-based superconductors,
$2\Delta_{\rm max}/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}$ was found to be 9. [22]

Additionally we have succeeded to measure the superconducting gap
opening for a Ca_(1 − x)Na_(x)Fe₂As₂ phase with $T_{\rm c}$ of 14 K. The
temperature dependence of the energy-momentum cut passing through the BZ
center is shown in Fig. 3(a). Figures 3(b) and 3(c) present a
temperature dependence of the partial density of states for inner and
outer Γ barrels respectively. Figures 3(d) and 3(e) show 1-K densities
of states fitted with a Dynes function. The derived values for the
superconducting gap are equal to 3.5 and 1.9 meV for the inner and outer
Γ barrel, respectively.

In Fig. 4 we summarize the relation between the gap magnitude for
different hole-doped 122 iron arsenides. All available compounds,
Ba_(1 − x)As_(x)Fe₂As₂ (BKFA), Ba_(1 − x)Na_(x)Fe₂As₂ (BNFA), and
Ca_(1 − x)Na_(x)Fe₂As₂ (CNFA), exhibit similar momentum dependence of
the superconducting gap with a drastic difference between the large gap
(at the inner Γ barrel and propeller) and the small gap (at the outer Γ
barrel), inherent also to many other iron arsenides. [24] One can
clearly observe some common features for the behavior of these large and
small gaps: $2\Delta/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}$ for the large gap is always
more than the universal BCS value of 3.52, while for the smaller gap it
is less; the deviation of the large gap upward from the universal value
is roughly proportional to the deviation of the small gap downwards.
Generally there is a well defined trend: samples with a higher value of
$T_{\rm c}$ exhibit higher $2\Delta/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}$, similarly to
the tendency, noted for a broad class of unconventional superconductors
by Inosov _et al._[25] However, it is rather difficult to argue that Δ
as a function of $T_{\rm c}$ can be approximated by a single smooth
curve for all compounds, in particular there are Ca_(1 − x)Na_(x)Fe₂As₂
and Ba_(1 − x)Na_(x)Fe₂As₂ samples having virtually the same $T_{\rm c}$
(33 and 34 K) and substantially different gaps (7.8 and 10.5 meV).
Merging of gap magnitudes to the BCS value for samples with low critical
temperatures, also observed in specific-heat studies of
BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂, [26] is consistent with decrease of
electron-mediator coupling strength. [27] The absence of strong
universality in the $\Delta(T_{\rm c})$ curve can stem from differences
of electron pairing due to moderately varying Fermi-surface geometry of
the considered compounds. Alternatively the universality of the gap
magnitude can be disturbed by the obviously present here interplay of
superconducting and magnetic orders. [28]

In conclusion, we have presented investigation of the electronic band
dispersion and superconducting gap distribution in a new 122-iron
arsenide, Ca_(1 − x)Na_(x)Fe₂As₂. The Fermi surface consists of holelike
sheets at Γ and a propellerlike structure at the X point, therefore
excluding the possibility of good nesting. On the other hand, two inner
Γ barrels and propeller are of comparable sizes, are separated by the
(π,π) vector, and all are predominantly composed of iron 3d_(xz, yz)
orbitals, indicating that there are channels for enhanced electron
scattering at the antiferromagnetic vector. The superconducting gap is
large (∼7.8 meV) for the inner Γ barrels and propeller, and small (∼2.3
meV) for the outer Γ barrel. Though the gap is mostly uniform within
each FS sheet and no indication for gap nodes have been found, there is
evidence for in-plane gap minima along the ΓX direction for the outer Γ
barrel, and for a k_(z)-dependent gap with a minimum at the Z point for
inner Γ barrels. A rather complicated Fermi surface with clear
departures from the theoretical calculations is established as a
characteristic property of the hole-doped 122-iron arsenides with
highest $T_{\rm c}$s. Momentum dependence of the superconducting gap
appears very similar for all studied compounds too, suggesting
universality of the pairing mechanism.
