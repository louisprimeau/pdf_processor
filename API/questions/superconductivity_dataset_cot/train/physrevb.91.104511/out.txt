###### Abstract

Here we report a further investigation on the thermodynamic and transport properties, and an assessment of theoretical calculations, for the BiS_{2}-layered Bi_{3}O_{2}S_{3} superconductor. The polycrystalline sample is synthesized with a superconducting transition temperature of T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset}=5.75 K and T_{\rm c}^{\rm core}=4.03 K (\approxT_{\rm c}^{\rm max}) that drops to 3.3 K by applying a hydrostatic pressure of 6 kbar. Density-of-states (DOS) calculations give substantial hybridization between Bi, O, and S, with Bi the largest component of DOS, which supports the idea that the BiS_{2} layer is relevant for producing electron-phonon coupling. An analysis of previously published specific heat data for Bi_{3}O_{2}S_{3} is additionally suggestive of a strong electron-phonon interaction in the Bi-O-S system. The analysis of the Seebeck coefficient results strongly suggests that Bi_{3}O_{2}S_{3} is a semimetal. In fact, the semimetallic or narrow band gap behavior may occur in certain other materials in the BiS_{2}-layered class of materials, such as Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}.

## I Introduction

Understanding the reasons for superconductivity in Bi-O-S systems is important, especially since high-temperature superconductivity is seen in other Bi-based materials, such as Ba_{1-x}K_{x}BiO_{3} and Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{10+x}[1]. The superconducting members of Bi-O-S systems are based on BiS_{2} layers with large unit cells composed of various spacer layers. The members include Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} with T_{\rm c}=4.4 K, H_{\rm c2(0)}\sim 3 T, and a dominant-electron concentration of \sim2\times 10^{19} cm^{-3} at 300 K [2, 3, 4]. The enhanced density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level from Bi 6p_{x} and 6p_{y}, and the strong Fermi surface nesting of quasi-one-dimensional bands are predicted to play a role in Cooper pairing [2]. Theoretical tight-binding calculations on a similar BiS_{2}-layer-based system of LaOBiS_{2} (F doping; T_{\rm c}=10.6 K) [5] shows that the dominating bands for electron conduction and superconductivity are those derived from four Bi 6p-S3\,p orbitals that give nearly half-filled, electron-hole symmetric, quasi-one-dimensional bands [6] that give nesting of the Fermi surface. Other members of Bi-O-S systems include Bi_{6}O_{8}S_{5}[7] and Bi_{3}O_{2}S_{3}[8, 9]. Most recently, a critical temperature at T_{\rm c}=4.5 K was discovered in Bi_{3}O_{2}S_{3}[8] that appeared, based on that work, to be a typical type-II superconductor with T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset}=5.8 K, an upper critical field of H_{\rm c2}=4.8 T, and low electron-dominant carriers of \sim10^{19} cm^{-3}[9]. This paper focuses on Bi_{3}O_{2}S_{3} by advancing investigations into the reasons for superconductivity through theoretical calculations and bulk thermodynamic and transport property results. A schematic image of the unit cell is shown in the right inset of Fig. 1(a), depicting layers of (BiS_{2})_{2} (rocksalt type), Bi_{2}O_{2} (fluorite type), and S_{2}. We find that T_{\rm c} decreases by an application of 6 kbar, similar to Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}[10]. From Seebeck coefficient results and calculations, we find that Bi_{3}O_{2}S_{3} is in fact a semimetal and the band overlap is most likely in the range of 27-41 meV. From a study of previously published specific heat data for Bi_{3}O_{2}S_{3}, demonstrating low Fermi-level DOS, we also find evidence of a strong electron-phonon interaction in Bi-O-S systems.

## II Experiment

A polycrystalline sample of Bi_{3}O_{2}S_{3} was prepared by a conventional solid state reaction method according to Refs. [8, 9]. The Bi_{2}O_{3} powders and S pieces were weighed by targeting "Bi_{12}O_{18}S_{13}," fully mixed, ground, and then pressed into pellets. The pellets were sealed in an evacuated silica tube and placed in a prewarmed furnace at 430 ^{\circ}C. After 4 h, the sample was quenched in ice water. The sample was removed from the tube, reground and repressed, and then sealed in another quartz tube. The tube was placed back in the preheated furnace at 430 ^{\circ}C. After 14 h, the sample was quenched down to 0 ^{\circ}C with ice water. After another reginding and pelletizing, the pellets were sealed in an evacuated silica tube and placed in a preheated furnace at 520 ^{\circ}C for 17 h, and then quenched again. The resultant sample appeared black and dense. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was collected by a PANalytical X'Pert PRO MPD x-ray powder diffractometer with CuK\alpha radiation. The Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns was done with the fullprof software suite, using the reported Wyckoff positions [8] and the I4/mmm space group. The electrical and thermal transport measurements were performed in a Quantum Design (QD) physical property measurement system (PPMS), using a standard four-probe method. Magnetization measurements were performed in a QD magnetic property measurement system (MPMS). The application of pressure was performed in an Mcell 10 pressure cell (easyLab Technologies) inside the MPMS; the applied pressure was estimated from the T_{\rm c} of the Pb manometer. First-principles calculations were performed using the linearized augmented plane-wave code wien2k [11], employing the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof [12]. RK_{\rm max} was set to 9.0, where R is the smallest muffin-tin radius and K_{\rm max} the largest plane-wave wave vector. Muffin-tin radii for all calculations, in units of the Bohr radius a_{0}, were as follows: Bi, 2.31; O, 1.89; S, 2.08, except for the dimerized S, which was taken as 1.8. All internal coordinates were optimized until forces were less than 2 mRy/bohr, while lattice parameters were taken from experiment. Here, 1000 or more k points in the full Brillouin zone were used for all calculations. Spin-orbit coupling was included for all calculations, except for the optimization. We also performed Boltzmann transport calculations of the thermopower using the bolzttrap code [13]. For these calculations as many as 40 000 k points in the full Brillouin zone were used.

## III Results and discussion

Figure 1(a) shows the XRD pattern for polycrystalline Bi3O2S3, which looks very similar to that reported in Ref. [8]. Only tiny impurity amounts of Bi2OS2 [8], Bi2S3, and Bi are present, which have also been taken into account for a refinement that improved the fitting. The refined lattice constants are a = 3.9645(5) A and c = 41.3165(4) A. Impurity phases were estimated using the Hill and Howard method [14], and their total contents were less than 8% by mass.

The temperature dependence of resistivity is shown in Fig. 1(b). In zero field, T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} = 5.75 K and T_{\text{c}}^{\text{zero}} = 4.03 K. Upon application of a 1 T magnetic field it can be seen that the T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} shifts to lower temperature and the sample does not reach zero resistivity down to 2 K. The inset of Fig. 1(b) shows resistivity up to room temperature. It displays a typical metallic behavior, similar to that of Bi4O4S3 [2]. The temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility is shown in Fig. 1(c). The sharp transition in \chi(T) indicates that the sample is rather homogeneous. The value of T_{\text{c}}, defined by the divergence of zero-field-cooled and field-cooled results, is about 4.1 K. The shielding volume fraction at 1.8 K is \sim93%. Higher field measurements [the inset of Fig. 1(c)] reveal that Bi3O2S3 exhibits a diamagnetic behavior without any abrupt drop or anomaly, indicating there is no magnetic ordering in this system. Compressing the structural lattice parameters by applying external pressure is believed to be an effective method for exploring the optimized condition for superconductivity. To this end, we have performed a pressure study of the temperature dependence of susceptibility for Bi3O2S3 below 5 K. The hydrostatic pressure does not improve the superconductivity of the sample, while, on the contrary, the transition temperature T_{\text{c}}^{\text{mag}}\sim 4 K at ambient pressure decreases to 3.3 K at 6 kbar, as shown in Fig. 1(d). Although a similar T_{\text{c}} suppression was seen in Bi4O4S3 [10], further theoretical work on the DOS and a structural analysis at high pressure could be useful for a better understanding of this effect.

The band structure calculation of Bi3O2S3 is shown in Fig. 2(a); it suggests that this material is a semiconductor with a very small band gap (approximately 25 meV) and substantial

  band degeneracy, particularly in the conduction bands, where a second band minimum occurs less than 50 meV above the primary band minimum, with all these extrema at or very near the N point. The calculated density of states for this material is shown in Fig. 2(b). The plot shows a comparatively heavy band just below the valence band maximum, and a somewhat lighter band in the conduction band. This band shows substantial hybridization between the Bi, O, and S. Previous papers have argued for the importance of the BiS_{2} layers in generating electron-phonon coupling [2], and this hybridization is supportive of this idea.

One natural interpretation of our experimental data in light of these plots is that Bi_{3}O_{2}S_{3} is indeed a narrow band semiconductor, with an extrinsic n-type doping level of approximately 1.5\times 10^{19} cm^{-3}, as suggested by the Hall data within a single-sign conduction model. However, one immediately finds two problems with this explanation. First, this inferred carrier concentration is the same as found in the prior work (see Ref. [9]), and were this simply a semiconductor, such a coincidence in extrinsic doping levels would seem rather unlikely. Second, and more compellingly, the thermopower data presented in Fig. 3 shows strong evidence of semimetallic, rather than semiconducting, behavior. In Fig. 3 we plot the experimental Seebeck data, along with two theoretical fits to the data. These fits were generated using the first-principles calculated band structure, with the thermopower calculated via the Boltzmann transport code bolz/trap[13], using the constant scattering time approximation, which has shown considerable success in describing doped semiconductors. Note that the thermopower was calculated from the transport results as the conductivity-weighted thermopower [i.e., S=(\sigma_{xx}S_{x}+\sigma_{yy}S_{y}+\sigma_{zz}S_{z})/(\sigma_{xx}+\sigma_{ yy}+\sigma_{zz})], which is appropriate for a polycrystalline sample; please see Ref. [15] for details of this procedure.

The first fit (dashed line) was plotted using the first-principles calculated band gap of 30 meV for a chemical carrier concentration of n=1.2\times 10^{19} cm^{-3}, comparatively near the value that would be obtained from the Hall number assuming single-sign conduction (note that these two need not be exactly equal). This fit shows a low-temperature thermopower slope S/T (T<50 K), approximately _ten_ times the measured value, and then rapidly enters the bipolar regime soon thereafter. Neither of these behaviors resembles the gently increasing curve in the experimental data (we suspect this data would show a maximum at T\sim 350 K). We have also tried fitting the data with a much heavier chemical doping (n=1.5\times 10^{20} cm^{-3}, not shown). While one can fit the initial slope of S(T) in this way, the thermopower magnitude at temperatures above 50 K continues to increase linearly, reaching magnitudes much larger than the experimental value. This is not surprising considering that E_{F}(T=0) in this case is approximately 150 meV above the conduction band minimum, and nearly 180 meV above the valence band maximum, so that bipolar effects are minimal in this temperature range at this

  doping. The second curve (black solid line) was generated using the first-principles calculated band structure with a "scissor shift" employed. In this "scissor shift" the conduction and valence band structures are taken as unchanged, but the band gap is adjusted. The plot indicates that a band overlap of 0.003\text{ Ry}=41\text{ meV} (i.e., a -41\text{ meV band gap}) produces a good fit to the experimental data. We take this as strong evidence that Bi_{3}O_{2}S_{3} is in fact a semimetal, not a semiconductor. Note that we are also able to fit the data with a somewhat smaller band overlap of 27 meV, so we can say that the actual band overlap is most likely in the range of 27-41 meV. This also implies that the actual carrier concentration likely differs significantly from the value the Hall number would indicate, if a single-sign conduction model were assumed.

We note that this apparent overstatement of the band gap in the electronic structure calculations is unusual, given that the GGA usually understates band gaps due to a self-interaction error and other issues. However, it is currently an outstanding electronic structure problem to compute band gaps sufficiently accurately to accurately predict room temperature transport properties, and the problem is only exacerbated at temperatures below room temperature. While progress has been made [16] in calculating band gaps, one sometimes is simply forced to resort to so-called "scissor shifts," as implemented here and in Ref. [17] to attain quantitative agreement with experiment. We do not have a definite explanation for the band gap overstatement, but note that band gap understatement is not a necessary consequence of all such first-principles calculations. For example, in Ref. [18] the band gap of FeSi is calculated as approximately 0.1 eV while transport measurements (in this case, resistivity) indicate a gap of approximately 0.05 eV. In that work it is asserted that FeSi is strongly correlated, and there have been similar suggestions in the literature [19] regarding possible correlation effects in the oxybismuth sulfides. We think it possible that the neglect of correlation effects in our density-functional theory calculations accounts for the apparent overstatement of the band gap.

With the electronic structure established, let us consider the superconductivity itself in more detail. Let us now make an approximate estimate of the strength of the electron-phonon interaction that is presumed responsible for the superconductivity, using present and previous data. In Ref. [9] a value of the T-linear specific heat constant \gamma=1.65\text{ mJ}/\text{mol K}^{2} was reported. On a density-of-states basis this is 0.7/\text{eV} formula unit, or 0.23/\text{eV} BiS unit, noting that previous works [6] have argued the BiS_{2} layers to be the relevant component producing electron-phonon coupling, the presumed pairing source. Assuming a modified BCS expression T_{\text{c}}\sim\omega_{\text{D}}\exp[-(1+\lambda)/\lambda], including the Eliashberg mass renormalization, and neglecting the Coulomb pseudopotential \mu^{*}, a 5 K T_{\text{c}} with the 188 K Debye temperature estimated in Ref. [9] corresponds to an electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda=N_{0}V of 0.38. This yields a modified electron-phonon interaction potential V of 1.5 eV per BiS unit. This rough calculation suggests a particularly strong interaction and one that could presumably be strengthened significantly via charge doping to increase N_{0}, if feasible, leading to larger T_{\text{c}}.

We note that the same features suggestive of semimetallic behavior in Bi_{3}O_{2}S_{3}--the increasing thermal conductivity above the Debye temperature and likely saturation and turning over of the temperature dependent thermopower--appear to be present in the related material Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}[20]. In this case we cannot easily distinguish between a semimetal and narrow band gap semiconductor, but note that both cases are strongly at odds with the band structure calculations for this material published in Ref. [2], which depict a band edge some 0.6 eV above E_{F}, i.e., metallic behavior. Hence the observance of semimetallic or narrow band gap behavior may be more common in this class of materials than previously thought.

## IV Conclusions

In summary, we have synthesized and confirmed the bulk superconductivity by both resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements in the BiS_{2}-layer-based superconductor Bi_{3}O_{2}S_{3}. Hall results find the same Hall number as in previous work, and this, combined with a theoretical analysis of our Seebeck coefficient data, lead to the conclusion that Bi_{3}O_{2}S_{3} is in fact a semimetal with a band overlap in the range of 27-41 meV. An analysis of previous data showing a low Fermi-level density of states [9] suggests that the electron-phonon interaction in this material is quite strong and that T_{\text{c}} could be increased by appropriate charge doping.

Here, 1000 or more k points in the full Brillouin zone were used for all calculations. Spin-orbit coupling was included for all calculations, except for the optimization. We also performed Boltzmann transport calculations of the thermopower using the bolzttrap code [13]. For these calculations as many as 40 000 k points in the full Brillouin zone were used.

## III Results and discussion

Figure 1(a) shows the XRD pattern for polycrystalline Bi3O2S3, which looks very similar to that reported in Ref. [8]. Only tiny impurity amounts of Bi2OS2 [8], Bi2S3, and Bi are present, which have also been taken into account for a refinement that improved the fitting. The refined lattice constants are a = 3.9645(5) A and c = 41.3165(4) A. Impurity phases were estimated using the Hill and Howard method [14], and their total contents were less than 8% by mass.

The temperature dependence of resistivity is shown in Fig. 1(b). In zero field, T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} = 5.75 K and T_{\text{c}}^{\text{zero}} = 4.03 K. Upon application of a 1 T magnetic field it can be seen that the T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} shifts to lower temperature and the sample does not reach zero resistivity down to 2 K. The inset of Fig. 1(b) shows resistivity up to room temperature. It displays a typical metallic behavior, similar to that of Bi4O4S3 [2]. The temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility is shown in Fig. 1(c). The sharp transition in \chi(T) indicates that the sample is rather homogeneous. The value of T_{\text{c}}, defined by the divergence of zero-field-cooled and field-cooled results, is about 4.1 K. The shielding volume fraction at 1.8 K is \sim93%. Higher field measurements [the inset of Fig. 1(c)] reveal that Bi3O2S3 exhibits a diamagnetic behavior without any abrupt drop or anomaly, indicating there is no magnetic ordering in this system. Compressing the structural lattice parameters by applying external pressure is believed to be an effective method for exploring the optimized condition for superconductivity. To this end, we have performed a pressure study of the temperature dependence of susceptibility for Bi3O2S3 below 5 K. The hydrostatic pressure does not improve the superconductivity of the sample, while, on the contrary, the transition temperature T_{\text{c}}^{\text{mag}}\sim 4 K at ambient pressure decreases to 3.3 K at 6 kbar, as shown in Fig. 1(d). Although a similar T_{\text{c}} suppression was seen in Bi4O4S3 [10], further theoretical work on the DOS and a structural analysis at high pressure could be useful for a better understanding of this effect.

The band structure calculation of Bi3O2S3 is shown in Fig. 2(a); it suggests that this material is a semiconductor with a very small band gap (approximately 25 meV) and substantial

  band degeneracy, particularly in the conduction bands, where a second band minimum occurs less than 50 meV above the primary band minimum, with all these extrema at or very near the N point. The calculated density of states for this material is shown in Fig. 2(b). The plot shows a comparatively heavy band just below the valence band maximum, and a somewhat lighter band in the conduction band. This band shows substantial hybridization between the Bi, O, and S. Previous papers have argued for the importance of the BiS_{2} layers in generating electron-phonon coupling [2], and this hybridization is supportive of this idea.

One natural interpretation of our experimental data in light of these plots is that Bi_{3}O_{2}S_{3} is indeed a narrow band semiconductor, with an extrinsic n-type doping level of approximately 1.5\times 10^{19} cm^{-3}, as suggested by the Hall data within a single-sign conduction model. However, one immediately finds two problems with this explanation. First, this inferred carrier concentration is the same as found in the prior work (see Ref. [9]), and were this simply a semiconductor, such a coincidence in extrinsic doping levels would seem rather unlikely. Second, and more compellingly, the thermopower data presented in Fig. 3 shows strong evidence of semimetallic, rather than semiconducting, behavior. In Fig. 3 we plot the experimental Seebeck data, along with two theoretical fits to the data. These fits were generated using the first-principles calculated band structure, with the thermopower calculated via the Boltzmann transport code bolz/trap[13], using the constant scattering time approximation, which has shown considerable success in describing doped semiconductors. Note that the thermopower was calculated from the transport results as the conductivity-weighted thermopower [i.e., S=(\sigma_{xx}S_{x}+\sigma_{yy}S_{y}+\sigma_{zz}S_{z})/(\sigma_{xx}+\sigma_{ yy}+\sigma_{zz})], which is appropriate for a polycrystalline sample; please see Ref. [15] for details of this procedure.

The first fit (dashed line) was plotted using the first-principles calculated band gap of 30 meV for a chemical carrier concentration of n=1.2\times 10^{19} cm^{-3}, comparatively near the value that would be obtained from the Hall number assuming single-sign conduction (note that these two need not be exactly equal). This fit shows a low-temperature thermopower slope S/T (T<50 K), approximately _ten_ times the measured value, and then rapidly enters the bipolar regime soon thereafter. Neither of these behaviors resembles the gently increasing curve in the experimental data (we suspect this data would show a maximum at T\sim 350 K). We have also tried fitting the data with a much heavier chemical doping (n=1.5\times 10^{20} cm^{-3}, not shown). While one can fit the initial slope of S(T) in this way, the thermopower magnitude at temperatures above 50 K continues to increase linearly, reaching magnitudes much larger than the experimental value. This is not surprising considering that E_{F}(T=0) in this case is approximately 150 meV above the conduction band minimum, and nearly 180 meV above the valence band maximum, so that bipolar effects are minimal in this temperature range at this

  doping. The second curve (black solid line) was generated using the first-principles calculated band structure with a "scissor shift" employed. In this "scissor shift" the conduction and valence band structures are taken as unchanged, but the band gap is adjusted. The plot indicates that a band overlap of 0.003\text{ Ry}=41\text{ meV} (i.e., a -41\text{ meV band gap}) produces a good fit to the experimental data. We take this as strong evidence that Bi_{3}O_{2}S_{3} is in fact a semimetal, not a semiconductor. Note that we are also able to fit the data with a somewhat smaller band overlap of 27 meV, so we can say that the actual band overlap is most likely in the range of 27-41 meV. This also implies that the actual carrier concentration likely differs significantly from the value the Hall number would indicate, if a single-sign conduction model were assumed.

We note that this apparent overstatement of the band gap in the electronic structure calculations is unusual, given that the GGA usually understates band gaps due to a self-interaction error and other issues. However, it is currently an outstanding electronic structure problem to compute band gaps sufficiently accurately to accurately predict room temperature transport properties, and the problem is only exacerbated at temperatures below room temperature. While progress has been made [16] in calculating band gaps, one sometimes is simply forced to resort to so-called "scissor shifts," as implemented here and in Ref. [17] to attain quantitative agreement with experiment. We do not have a definite explanation for the band gap overstatement, but note that band gap understatement is not a necessary consequence of all such first-principles calculations. For example, in Ref. [18] the band gap of FeSi is calculated as approximately 0.1 eV while transport measurements (in this case, resistivity) indicate a gap of approximately 0.05 eV. In that work it is asserted that FeSi is strongly correlated, and there have been similar suggestions in the literature [19] regarding possible correlation effects in the oxybismuth sulfides. We think it possible that the neglect of correlation effects in our density-functional theory calculations accounts for the apparent overstatement of the band gap.

With the electronic structure established, let us consider the superconductivity itself in more detail. Let us now make an approximate estimate of the strength of the electron-phonon interaction that is presumed responsible for the superconductivity, using present and previous data. In Ref. [9] a value of the T-linear specific heat constant \gamma=1.65\text{ mJ}/\text{mol K}^{2} was reported. On a density-of-states basis this is 0.7/\text{eV} formula unit, or 0.23/\text{eV} BiS unit, noting that previous works [6] have argued the BiS_{2} layers to be the relevant component producing electron-phonon coupling, the presumed pairing source. Assuming a modified BCS expression T_{\text{c}}\sim\omega_{\text{D}}\exp[-(1+\lambda)/\lambda], including the Eliashberg mass renormalization, and neglecting the Coulomb pseudopotential \mu^{*}, a 5 K T_{\text{c}} with the 188 K Debye temperature estimated in Ref. [9] corresponds to an electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda=N_{0}V of 0.38. This yields a modified electron-phonon interaction potential V of 1.5 eV per BiS unit. This rough calculation suggests a particularly strong interaction and one that could presumably be strengthened significantly via charge doping to increase N_{0}, if feasible, leading to larger T_{\text{c}}.

We note that the same features suggestive of semimetallic behavior in Bi_{3}O_{2}S_{3}--the increasing thermal conductivity above the Debye temperature and likely saturation and turning over of the temperature dependent thermopower--appear to be present in the related material Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}[20]. In this case we cannot easily distinguish between a semimetal and narrow band gap semiconductor, but note that both cases are strongly at odds with the band structure calculations for this material published in Ref. [2], which depict a band edge some 0.6 eV above E_{F}, i.e., metallic behavior. Hence the observance of semimetallic or narrow band gap behavior may be more common in this class of materials than previously thought.

## IV Conclusions

In summary, we have synthesized and confirmed the bulk superconductivity by both resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements in the BiS_{2}-layer-based superconductor Bi_{3}O_{2}S_{3}. Hall results find the same Hall number as in previous work, and this, combined with a theoretical analysis of our Seebeck coefficient data, lead to the conclusion that Bi_{3}O_{2}S_{3} is in fact a semimetal with a band overlap in the range of 27-41 meV. An analysis of previous data showing a low Fermi-level density of states [9] suggests that the electron-phonon interaction in this material is quite strong and that T_{\text{c}} could be increased by appropriate charge doping.
