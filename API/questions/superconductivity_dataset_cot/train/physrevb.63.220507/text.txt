###### Abstract

We report \({}^{115}\)In nuclear-quadrupole-resonance (NQR) measurements of the pressure(_P_)-induced superconductor CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) in the antiferromagnetic (AF) and superconducting (SC) states. In the AF region, the internal field \(H_{int}\) at the In site is substantially reduced from \(H_{int}\)=1.75 kOe at _P_= 0 to 0.39 kOe at _P_= 1.23 GPa, while the Neel temperature slightly changes with increasing \(P\). This suggests that either the size in the ordered moment \(M_{Q}(P)\) or the angle \(\theta(P)\) between the direction of \(M_{Q}(P)\) and the tetragonal \(c\) axis is extrapolated to zero at _P_* = 1.6 +- 0.1 GPa at which a bulk SC transition is no longer emergent. In the SC state at \(P\) = 2.1 GPa, the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate \({}^{115}\)(1/_T_1) has revealed a \(T\)3 dependence without the coherence peak just below _T_\({}_{c}\), giving evidence for the unconventional superconductivity. The dimensionality of the magnetic fluctuations in the normal state is also discussed.

pacs: DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.63.220507 PACS number(s): 74.25.Nf, 74.62.Fj, 74.70.Tx, 75.30.Kz There is increasing evidence that a superconducting (SC) order in cerium (Ce)-based heavy-fermion (HF) compounds takes place nearby the border where an antiferromagnetic (AF) order is suppressed by applying pressure (_P_) to the HF-AF compounds CeCu\({}_{2}\)Ge\({}_{2}\),\({}^{1}\) CePd\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\),\({}^{2}\) and CeIn\({}_{3}\).\({}^{3}\) When a magnetic medium is near an AF phase, AF waves of electron-spin density tend to propagate over a long distance with a low characteristic energy. Thereby, it was argued that the binding of the Cooper pairs could be described in terms of the emission and absorption of fluctuating AF waves.\({}^{3}\) The interplay between the AF and SC states in the Ce-based HF systems may share some common aspects with other strongly-correlated-electron systems, and the understanding of mechanisms for superconductivity different from the conventional electron-phonon mediated one is still an important and unresolved issue.

Quite recently, it was discovered that a new HF-AF CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) (the Neel temperature, \(T_{N}\) = 3.8 K) becomes a bulk HF superconductor at pressures exceeding _P_\({}_{c}\)\(\sim\) 1.63 GPa.\({}^{4}\) It was suggested that a first-order-like transition from an AF state to a SC state occurs with a SC transition temperature _T_\({}_{c}\)\(\sim\) 2.2 K that is nearly 10 times larger than the maximum values for CePd\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\) and CeIn\({}_{3}\). Apparently, the evolution from the AF to SC states differs from all previous examples. \(T_{N}\) was reported to increase weakly with the pressure for \(P\) \(\leq\) 1.45 GPa, above which there is no resistive signature for \(T_{N}\). In order to shed light on a _P_-induced exotic evolution from the AF to SC states in CeRhIn\({}_{5}\), one needs to uncover magnetic and SC characteristics through extensive experiments under \(P\).

Here we report extensive \({}^{115}\)In-NQR measurements of CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) in the AF and SC states. The temperature (_T_) and \(P\) dependences of the \({}^{115}\)In-NQR spectrum and the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate \({}^{115}\)(1/_T_1) were measured in a \(P\) range of 0 - 2.1 GPa and a \(T\) range of 0.15-50 K. The salient results are as follows: (1) \(T_{N}\) slightly increases up to \(P\) = 1.00 GPa, but decreases at \(P\) = 1.23 GPa; (2) by contrast, the internal field \(H_{int}\) at the In site due to the magnetic ordering is substantially reduced with \(P\). This _P_-induced reduction in \(H_{int}\) might be attributed to either an ordered moment \(M_{Q}(P)\)\(\rightarrow\) 0 or the angle \(\theta\)\(\rightarrow\) 0 at _P_* = 1.6 +- 0.1 GPa, where \(\theta\) is the angle between the direction of \(M_{Q}(P)\) and the tetragonal \(c\) axis; (3) the \({}^{115}\)(1/_T_1) in the SC state at \(P\) = 2.1 GPa obeys a \(T\)3 dependence without the coherence peak just below _T_\({}_{c}\) consistent with a line-node gap model as reported in all previous HF-SC compounds,\({}^{5}\) and (4) in the normal state at \(P\) = 2.1 GPa, the \(T\) dependence of \({}^{115}\)(1/_T_1) is consistent with the three dimensional (3D) self-consistent renormalization (SCR) theory for a nearly AF Fermi-liquid state.\({}^{6-8}\)

The single crystal of CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) was grown by the self-flux method.\({}^{4}\) Powder x-ray diffraction measurements indicated that the compound consists of a single phase that is formed in the primitive tetragonal HoCoGa\({}_{3}\) structure. The single crystal was moderately crushed into grains in order to make rf pulses penetrate into samples easily. The hydrostatic pressure was applied by utilizing a NiCrAl/BeCu piston-cylinder cell, filled with a Si-based organic liquid as a pressure-transmitting medium. The high-frequency ac-susceptibility (ac-_x_) was measured at \(P\) = 1.5, 1.65, 1.8, and 2.15 GPa by using the _in situ_ NQR coil. The ac-_x_ data show a sharp SC transition at _T_\({}_{c}\) = 2.1 and 2.2 K at \(P\) = 1.8 and 2.15 GPa, respectively [see Fig. 4(b)]. The \({}^{115}\)In-NQR spectrum was obtained by plotting the intensity of spin-echo signal as a function of frequency in \(T\) = 1.4 - 10 K and \(P\) = 0 - 2.1 GPa. \(T\)1 was measured by the conventional saturation-recovery method in \(T\) = 0.15 - 50 K at \(P\) = 0, 1.23, and 2.1 GPa.

CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) consists of alternating layers of CeIn\({}_{3}\) and RhIn\({}_{2}\) and hence has two inequivalent In sites per a unit cell. The In(1) site, analogous to the single In site in a cubic CeIn\({}_{3}\), is located on the top and bottom faces of the tetragonal unit cell. By considering the symmetry of the In(1) site, this site was characterized by \(v_{Q}\) = 6.78 +- 0.01 MHz and an asymme  try parameter \(\eta\) = 0 in the previous NQR study. [9] Here \(\nu_{Q}\) and \(\eta\) are defined by the NQR Hamiltonian: \(H_{Q}\) = (\(\,n\,\nu_{Q}\)/6)[\(\,3\,I_{z}^{2}\) - \(I^{2}\) + \(\eta(I_{x}^{2}\) - \(I_{y}^{2}\))]. The In(1)-NQR spectrum in the paramagnetic state at 4.2 K and \(P\) = 0 is shown in the bottom of Fig. 1 where four transitions are found at the different frequencies \(\nu\) = \(\,n\,\nu_{Q}\) with \(\,n\,\)= 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

In order to deduce the \(T\) dependence of the internal field \(H_{int}(T)\) at the In(1) site in the AF state, we focus on the splitting of the 2 \(\nu_{Q}\) (\(\,\pm\,3/2\omega\,\pm\,1/2\)) transition and the shift of resonance frequency of the 3 \(\nu_{Q}\) (\(\,\pm\,5/2\omega\,\pm\,3/2\)) transition in the In(1) spectrum below \(T_{N}\). This is because \(H_{int}\) lies perpendicular to the tetragonal \(c\) axis as reported in the previous study. [9] Including the Zeeman term \(H_{Z}\)= - \(\gamma\)\(h\)\(I_{x}\) - \(H_{int}\) where \(\gamma\) is the gyromagnetic ratio, we diagonalize the full Hamiltonian \(H_{acc}\) = \(H_{Q}\) + \(H_{Z}\) and determine the \(H_{int}(T)\) for different values of \(P\). The 2 \(\nu_{Q}\) transition at \(P\) = 0 shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1 is asymmetrically split into two resonances by \(H_{int}\), consistently with the previous result. [9] By contrast, the resonance frequency \(\nu_{p}\) of the 3 \(\nu_{Q}\) transition is decreased by \(H_{int}\) as seen in Fig. 1. The \(T\) dependence of \(\nu_{p}\) at \(P\) = 0, 0.46, 1.00, and 1.23 GPa is shown in Fig. 2(a). \(T_{N}\) is marked by arrows in Fig. 2(a) and is precisely determined as the temperature below which \(\nu_{p}\) decreases. It is notable that \(T_{N}\) slightly increases from 3.8 K at \(P\) = 0 to \(\sim\) 4 K at \(P\) = 1.00 GPa, but decreases to \(\sim\) 3.6 K at \(P\) = 1.23 GPa. The occurrence of the magnetic ordering at \(P\) = 1.23 GPa is clearly corroborated by a distinct peak in 1/\(T_{1}\)\(T\) at \(T_{N}\) = 3.6 K that probes critical magnetic fluctuations toward the magnetic ordering as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a).

\(H_{int}\) = 1.75 kOe at \(P\) = 0 and \(T\) = 1.4 K is estimated from the size of \(\nu_{p}\) reduction of the 3 \(\nu_{Q}\) transition as well as the splitting of the 2 \(\nu_{Q}\) transition. This is consistent with the previous result. [9] Note that \(\nu_{p}\) is only sensitive to the magnitude of \(H_{int}\). \(H_{int}(P)\) is plotted against a reduced temperature \(t\) = \(T\)/\(T_{N}\) in Fig. 2(b). Unexpectedly, the saturated value of \(H_{int}\)\(\sim\) 0.39 kOe at \(P\) = 1.23 GPa is about five times smaller than \(H_{int}\)\(\sim\) 1.75 kOe at \(P\) = 0, although \(T_{N}\) changes moderately. This slight pressure dependence of \(T_{N}\) contrasts with the strong reduction of \(H_{int}\). A recent neutron experiment reported that Ce-ordered moments [\(M_{Q}\) = 0.264(4) \(\mu_{B}\) at 1.4 K and \(P\) = 0] that lie in the basal plane are antiferromagnetically aligned, but they spiral transversely along the

The inset shows the temperature dependence of \(115(1/T_{1}T)\) at \(P\) = 1.23 GPa. (b) Temperature dependence of the internal field \(H_{int}\) is plotted against \(t\) = \(T\)/\(T_{N}\) at \(P\) = 0, 0.46, 1.00, and 1.23 GPa. The inset indicates \(H_{int}(t)\)/\(H_{int}(0)\) vs \(t\) plots. Here \(H_{int}(0)\) is a saturated value at low temperature.

The lower panel indicates the \({}^{115}\)In-NQR spectrum at ambient pressure (\(P\) = 0) above \(T_{N}\). In the absence of internal field, the In(1) spectrum consists of four transitions given by \(\nu\) = \(\,n\,\nu_{Q}\), where \(\,n\,\)= 1, 2, 3, and 4 (see text). Below \(T_{N}\), the 2 \(\nu_{Q}\) and 3 \(\nu_{Q}\) transition splits asymmetrically and shifts, respectively.

  axis with an incommensurate wave vector \(\mathbf{q}_{\mathrm{M}}\)\(=\)(1/2, 1/2, 0.297). [10]\(H_{int}(P)\) is then extrapolated to zero at \(P\)\(\approx\) = 1.6 \(\pm\) 0.1 GPa [see Fig. 4(a)]. If \(M_{Q}(P)\) is directed in the basal plane, the \(M_{Q}\) would be scaled to \(H_{int}\) and substantially reduced to \(\sim\)0.05\(\mu_{B}\) at \(P\)\(=\) 1.23 GPa. On the other hand, if \(M_{Q}(P)\) is rotated with \(P\) from the \(ab\) plane to the \(c\) axis, the angle \(\theta\) between the direction of \(M_{Q}\) and the \(c\) axis would be progressively smaller, extrapolated to zero at \(P\)\(\approx\) 1.6 \(\pm\) 0.1 GPa [see Fig. 4(a)]. This is because \(H_{int}\) at the In(1) site is canceled out at \(\theta\)\(=\) 0. \(H_{int}\) originates from the direct dipolar field from the Ce ordered moments that reaches 30% of the total and from the indirect "pseudo-" dipolar (anisotropic) field via the supertransferred hyperfine interaction. The latter internal field acts on the In site through the hybridization between In 5\(p\)- and Ce 4\(f\)-orbits. Note that the isotopic hyperfine field originating from Ce ordered moments is canceled out at the In(1) site. In order to see which \(P\)-induced change is more likely in the AF state, we need to consider the \(T\) dependence of \(H_{int}(t)/H_{int}(0)\) displayed in the inset of Fig. 2(b), where \(H_{int}(0)\) is the low-\(T\) saturated value. A rapid growing of \(H_{int}(T)\) is evident even at \(P\)\(=\) 1.23 GPa. It would be therefore unlikely that some itinerant magnetic ordering takes place with a _reduced moment_ and rather likely that the ordered moments rotate toward the \(c\) axis. As a result, it might be expected that the spiral order evolves into some commensurate AF fluctuation regime at \(P\)\(\approx\) 1.6 \(\pm\) 0.1 GPa. Note that \(P\)\({}^{*}\) is close in value to a critical pressure \(P_{c}\)\(\sim\)1.63 GPa which was suggested from the resistivity measurement. [4] To resolve this issue, further neutron experiment under pressure is highly desired.

We next deal with the SC region. The \(T_{1}\) in the SC and normal state at \(P\)\(=\) 2.1 GPa was measured at the 1 \(\nu_{Q}\) and 2 \(\nu_{Q}\) transitions in order to avoid heating effect due to \(rf\)-excitation pulses. \(T_{1}\) was determined by a single component. Figure 3 shows the \(T\) dependence of \({}^{115}\)(1/\(T_{1}\)) at \(P\) =0 and 2.1 GPa. \({}^{115}\)(1/\(T_{1}\)) exhibits no coherence peak just below \(T_{c}\)\(=\) 2.2 K, followed by a \(T^{3}\) dependence down to \(\sim\)0.3 K. This is a convincing experimental evidence for the unconventional nature of the \(P\)-induced superconductivity in CeRhIn\({}_{5}\). Likewise all previous examples, a line-node gap

Figure 4: (a) The pressure dependences of \(T_{N}\) (open triangles), \(T_{c}\) (open circles), and \(H_{int}\) (open diamonds) determined from the present work are shown together with the previous data (Ref. [4]). The \(H_{int}(P)\) is extrapolated to zero at \(P\)\({}^{*}\)\(=\) 1.6\(\pm\) 0.1 GPa as indicated by the dotted line. If the reduction of \(H_{int}(P)\) is attributed to the rotation of \(M_{Q}(P)\), \(H_{int}(P)\) is proportional to \(\sin\theta\) (see text). The SC transition width was marked by bars: \(T_{c}^{\mathrm{onset}}\)\(-T_{c}^{\mathrm{offset}}\) defined in Fig. 4(b). The solid lines are guides to the eye. (b) Temperature dependence of the high-frequency ac susceptibility (ac-\(\chi\)) measured using an _in situ_ NQR coil at various values of pressure. \(T_{c}\) is defined as the temperature at which the ac-\(\chi\) decreases to 10% of the total Meissner signal at each pressure. \(T_{c}^{\mathrm{onset}}\) and \(T_{c}^{\mathrm{offset}}\) are defined as the respective temperature at which the SC diamagnetism starts to emerge and the ac-\(\chi\) reaches to 90% of the total Meissner signal.

The solid line is a fit assuming a line-node gap \(\Delta(\phi)\)\(=\) \(\Delta_{0}\) cos \(\phi\) with 2\(\Delta_{0}\)\(=\) 5\(k_{\mathrm{B}}\)\(T_{c}\) . Inset: (\(T_{1}T\))\({}^{2}\) vs \(T\) plot at \(P\)\(=\) 2.1 GPa. The solid line is a fit based on the 3D-SCR theory.

Note that \(\chi_{Q}\)\({}^{\alpha}\)(\(T\)\(+\) \(\theta\))\({}^{-1}\) follows a Curie-Weiss law for the nearly AF Fermi-liquid regime.

  model is applicable to the SC state in CeRhIn\({}_{5}\). Assuming an anisotropic energy gap model with \(\Delta\!=\!\Delta_{0}\cos\theta\), a solid line in Fig. 3 is a fit for the \({}^{115}\)(1/\(T_{1}\)) data with \(2\Delta_{0}\!=\!5k_{\rm B}T_{c}\) .

We argue magnetic characters in the normal state at \(P\) = 2.1 GPa. According to the SCR theory for nearly-AF metals by Moriya _et al._, [6]\(1/T_{1}T^{\alpha}\chi_{Q}(T)^{n}\). Here a power-law dependence of the staggered susceptibility \(\chi_{Q}(T)\) is obtained as \(n\!=\!1\) and 1/2 for two (2D) and three dimensional (3D) electronic systems, respectively. By noting that \(\chi_{Q}(T)\) follows a Curie-Weiss law of 1/(\(T\!+\!\theta\)), a behavior of \((T_{1}T)^{2\alpha}\)(\(T\) + \(\theta\)) is expected for the 3D nearly AF regime. As a matter of fact, as indicated in the inset of Fig. 3, a fit of \((T_{1}T)^{2\alpha}\)(\(T\) + \(\theta\)) with \(\theta\!=\!1.5\) K is consistent with the present result in a relatively wide \(T\) range of \(T_{c}\!=\!2.2\)-\(30\) K. This shows that 3D AF fluctuations are dominant in the normal state at \(P\) = 2.1 GPa. [6, 7, 8]

Hegger _et al._ speculated that the maximum at \(T_{xm}\) = 7.5 K and \(P\!=\!0\) in the susceptibility is associated with the development of 2D AF correlations in the CeIn\({}_{3}\) layers, [4] since a 2D-like magnetic character is expected from its quasi-2D crystal structure in the lower \(P\) region. With increasing \(P\), \(T_{xm}\) decreases approximately linearly and it would be extrapolated to \(T\!=\!0\) at \(P_{m}\!=\!1.3\!\pm\!0.4\) GPa. It is noteworthy that \(P_{m}\) is comparable to \(P_{c}\!\sim\!1.63\) GPa and \(P\!*\!=\!1.6\!\pm\!0.1\) GPa. It is therefore reasonable to consider that, at \(P\!=\!2.1\) GPa exceeding either \(P_{m}\) or \(P\!*\), the 3D AF fluctuations character becomes dominant through a gradual crossover under pressure from the 2D regime to the 3D one. However, further works are needed to elucidate the role of critical AF fluctuations in the onset of the unconventional \(P\)-induced superconductivity in CeRhIn\({}_{5}\).

Figure 4(a) presents a phase diagram of the AF and SC phases along with the previous results. [4] According to the Ref. [4], at \(P_{c}\!\sim\!1.63\) GPa, the SC transition in the resistivity measurement begins around 2 K and reaches a zero-resistance state with a broad transition width. [4] In agreement, as shown in Fig. 4(b), we found that the onset temperature in ac-\(\chi\) is in accord with this zero resistance \(T_{c}\) . However, the size of the SC diamagnetism at 1.4 K in ac-\(\chi\) is substantially reduced. At \(P\!=\!1.5\) GPa, no change in ac-\(\chi\) is observable at all, supporting a critical pressure \(P_{c}\!\sim\!1.63\) GPa as suggested in the previous work. [4] Therefore it was ensured from the present ac-\(\chi\) measurement that the bulk SC transition takes place down to \(P\!=\!1.8\) GPa, but probably not at pressures lower than \(P\!=\!1.65\) GPa. The present NQR study confirms that \(T_{N}\) slightly increases up to \(T_{N}\!\sim\!4\) K at \(P\!=\!1.00\) GPa, but decreases to 3.6 K at \(P\!=\!1.23\) GPa. The internal field \(H_{int}\) is extrapolated to zero at \(P^{*}\!=\!1.6\!\pm\!0.1\) GPa which is close to \(P_{c}\!\sim\!1.63\) GPa. Either the reduction in the ordered moment \(M_{Q}\) or its rotation from the \(ab\) plane to the \(c\) axis may occur as \(P\) increases. From the rapid growing of \(H_{int}(P)\) upon cooling below \(T_{N}\) , we believe that the rotation of \(M_{Q}(P)\) occurs with \(P\), but its marked reduction does not. In this context, we suggest that the spiral order is presumably suppressed across a critical pressure \(P\!*\!=\!1.6\!\pm\!0.1\) GPa. Eventually, the SC transition emerges in CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) at pressures exceeding \(P\!*\). It is highly desired to elucidate whether AF or SC fluctuations prevent the onset of any type of long-range orders in the vicinity of \(P\!*\!=\!1.6\!\pm\!0.1\) GPa.

In conclusion, we have reported that unconventional magnetic and superconducting states are induced by applying \(P\) to the HF-AF CeRhIn\({}_{5}\). In the magnetic region, \(T_{N}\) exhibits a moderate variation. By contrast, \(H_{int}\), whose presence is due to the magnetic ordering is unexpectedly reduced at \(P\!=\!1.23\) GPa, extrapolated to zero at \(P*\!=\!1.6\!\pm\!0.1\) GPa. The spiral order might be suppressed presumably due to the rotation of the ordered moments toward the \(c\) axis. This \(P\!*\) is comparable to \(P_{c}\!\sim\!1.63\) GPa at which the bulk SC transition is not emergent as suggested from the previous resistivity [4] and corroborated by the present ac-\(\chi\) measurements. In the SC state at \(P\!=\!2.1\) GPa, we found \(1/T_{1}\!\approx\!T^{3}\) that shows the existence of line nodes in the gap function. In the normal state, the remarkable behavior of \((1/T_{1}T)\!\approx\!1/\sqrt{T+1.5}\), which is consistent with the 3D nearly AF fluctuation regime, suggests that the magnetic nature possesses a 3D-like character at pressures where the bulk SC sets in.
