###### Abstract

An extensive study of electrical resistivity, ac magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, specific heat, and NMR has been made on high purity samples of the spinel compounds CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. The superconducting transitions occur at 4.70 K in CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 3.48 K in CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. The magnetic susceptibilities show perfect diamagnetism in both compounds. Upper critical fields at T = 0 are estimated to be 20.0 and 4.40 kOe, the lower critical fields at T = 0 are 70 and 95 Oe, respectively. The thermodynamic critical fields at T = 0 are 704 Oe (CuRh_{2}S_{4}) and 445 Oe (CuRh_{2}Se_{4}). These values are obtained from the temperature dependence of the free energy. These compounds are type-II superconductors with Ginzburg-Landau parameters \kappa = 21 (CuRh_{2}S_{4}) and \kappa = 6.6 (CuRh_{2}Se_{4}) at T = 0. The electron-phonon coupling constants, \lambda_{\rm ep} = 0.68 (CuRh_{2}S_{4}) and \lambda_{\rm ep} = 0.64 (CuRh_{2}Se_{4}), are obtained using the McMillan formula. The copper nuclear-spin-relaxation rate as a function of temperature shows a pronounced coherence peak just below T_{c} for CuRh_{2}S_{4}. Experimental results are analyzed on the basis of the BCS theory. These compounds exist between weak- and intermediate-coupling superconductors which are driven by electron-phonon interaction. The Debye temperatures \Theta of these materials are 230 K (CuRh_{2}S_{4}) and 211 K (CuRh_{2}Se_{4}).

## I Introduction

The ternary sulpho- and selenospinels CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4} have the cubic spinel structure (Fig. 1) at room temperature and have lattice constants of a = 9.787 and 10.269 A, respectively. They have the normal spinel structure where the Cu ions occupy the A (tetrahedral) sites and the Rh ions occupy the B (octahedral) sites. The trivalent Rh ions at B sites are in the low-spin state (4d6:1d_6, e6) with no magnetic moment in a strong crystalline field. The valence of Cu has been the subject of controversy.[1, 2]

The ternary sulpho- and selenospinels CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4} show metallic conduction and nearly temperature-independent susceptibility. The electrical and magnetic properties of these compounds at high temperatures have been discussed by Lotgering and Van Staple.[3]

On the other hand, it has been reported that these compounds CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4} reveal superconducting transitions between 3 and 4 K. Only brief reports have been given by earlier workers,[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and no detailed study and analysis associated with the superconductivity have been made so far to our knowledge.

In this paper, we report experiments designed to explore in greater detail the superconducting characteristics of these spinel compounds. In order to elucidate these characteristics with an emphasis on the low-temperature region, we have carried out the following measurements: the temperature dependences of (1) electrical resistivity \rho, (2) diamagnetic ac and dc susceptibilities \chi, (3) magnetization M, (4) specific heat, and (5) copper NMR. These experimental results are discussed in terms of the BCS theory.

In addition, the normal-state electrical, magnetic, and thermal properties are also examined. In particular, the electrical resistivities of these materials in the normal state have similar characteristics to _A_-15 compounds such as Nb_{3}Sn.

 

## II Experimental Methods

### Sample preparation

Mixtures of high-purity fine powders of Cu, Rh, S, or Se with nominal stoichiometry were heated in sealed quartz tubes at 850 degC for periods of 10 days. Subsequently, the specimens were reground and sintered in pressed parallelepiped form at 850 degC for 48 h. X-ray diffraction data confirm the spinel phase in these powder specimens. Samples with dimensions of about 2.0\times 2.0\times 10 mm^{3} were used for the measurements of \rho and ac susceptibility \chi. For the magnetization (M-H curves), the sample dimensions were 1.0\times 1.0\times 8.0 mm^{3} with the fields applied parallel to the longest dimension. The filling densities of a sintered bar sample are 70% (CuRh_{2}S_{4}) and 87% (CuRh_{2}Se_{4}) in comparison with the values of single crystals (theoretical density).

### Electrical resistivity measurements

The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity was measured over the temperature region between 1.5 and 285 K. The resistivity was measured by a standard four-probe method. Silver paste was used to fabricate the electrodes.

### ac magnetic susceptibility measurements

ac complex magnetic susceptibility, \chi=\chi^{\prime}-i\chi^{\prime\prime}, was measured by using a Hartshorn bridge and a two-phase lock-in amplifier in the temperature range between 1.6 and 285 K. The operating frequency was 80 Hz and the amplitude of the ac magnetic field was 1.0 Oe. A parallelepiped-shaped sample was used with the longest dimension parallel to the magnetic field. Demagnetizing-field corrections were made for the sample, assuming completely homogeneous sintering in the whole specimen. The magnitude of the corrections in \chi was evaluated to be less than 12%.

### Specific-heat measurements

The specific-heat measurements were done using a conventional ^{3}He cryostat. For specific heat, a standard heat-pulse technique was employed. The addenda included the thermometer, heater, glue, etc. The corrections due to the addenda were made. The specific-heat measurements were performed in the temperature ranges between 1.69 and 16.3 K for CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 0.60 and 15.2 K for CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. Several sintered samples with total masses of 0.828 g (CuRh_{2}S_{4}) and 1.262 g (CuRh_{2}Se_{4}) were used for these measurements.

### dc magnetization

The dc magnetization curves at constant temperatures and the temperature dependences of the magnetization at a constant applied magnetic field of 10 kOe were performed with a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). The values of upper critical field H_{c2} were obtained by the magnetization curves up to only 10 kOe because of the limits of our apparatus.

### Cu NMR in CuRh_{2}S_{4}

A conventional phase-coherent pulsed NMR apparatus was used for measurements of the spectra of Cu nuclei and the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time T_{1}.[12, 13] The samples were crushed into a fine powder for these measurements. The copper NMR spectrum was obtained by (a) sweeping the magnetic field while maintaining a constant frequency of 12.5 MHz and (b) maintaining a constant field of 11 kOe. The Knight shift was determined by the gyromagnetic ratio for ^{63}Cu and the reference value of metallic Cu. The T_{1} measurements were made down to 1.4 K. Detailed NMR experimental results will be published elsewhere.[14]

## III Results and Discussion

### X-ray powder diffraction

Figures 2 and 3 present the x-ray diffraction patterns at room temperature for the samples CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. As can be seen in Figs. 2 and 3, all the diffraction peaks have been indexed to the cubic unit cell. These indexed peaks have (h,k,l) values that are either all even or all odd, which is consistent with a fcc unit cell. Both samples are single phase.

### Electrical resistivity

Figures 4 and 5 show the resistivity as a function of temperature. With decreasing temperature, the resistivities \rho decrease monotonically with shallow upturned curvatures and abrupt superconducting transitions at 4.70

Figure 1: The cubic unit cell of the spinel structure with lattice parameter a. Shaded circles A (Cu ions) lie on the corner and in the center of an octant. Black circles B (Rh ions) and white circles (S or Se ions) lie on the body diagonals of the octants at \frac{1}{4} of their lengths.

 and 3.48 K (midpoints) for the samples CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4}, respectively.

In CuRh_{2}S_{4}, the resistivity was measured with a current density of 0.47A/cm^{2}. The resistivity at 300 K is about 8 x 10^{-3}\Omega cm and the residual value of \rho_{0} is estimated to be 4.1 x 10^{-4}\Omega cm in the sintered specimen.

In the CuRh_{2}Se_{4} sample, the resistivity at 300 K is about 4.6 x 10^{-4}\Omega cm and just above T_{c} the resistivity \rho_{0} is about 2.3 x 10^{-6}\Omega cm. The data for CuRh_{2}Se_{4} are scattered at low temperatures because the resistivity becomes extremely small. Because of this low resistivity, a current density of 2.63 A/cm^{2} was used. It should be noted that such a high current density might suppress T_{c} slightly.

CuRh_{2}S_{4} has a 17 times larger resistivity than CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. The sample filling density is larger for CuRh_{2}Se_{4} than that of CuRh_{2}S_{4}. Furthermore, in the CuRh_{2}Se_{4} sample, the selenium anion has a larger ionic radius than that of sulfur and thus overlappings of the wave function between anions and cations are larger. Consequently, stronger covalent bonds and lower resistivity are expected for CuRh_{2}Se_{4}.

In the low-temperature range from T_{c} to 20 K, the \rho(T) of CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4} can be expressed well as a power law:  \[\rho(T) = \rho_{0} + \, A\, T^{n}\,\,,\] (1)

where A and n are constants. From the slope of the straight line in plots of \log_{10}[\rho(T) - \rho_{0}\rbrack vs \log_{10}T (Figs. 6 and 7), the value of n has been determined to be 3.1 and 2.8 for CuRh2S4 and CuRh2Se4. The temperature dependence of \rho(T) becomes weaker above 20 K. At high temperatures, \rho(T) tends to a linear function of T. The same behavior of the normal-state resistivity has been reported in the superconductor Th3Ni3Sn4.[15] The power law and the values of n close to 3.0 suggest that there exists a state density of d electrons at the Fermi energy, which is consistent with the spin fluctuation expected from the enhanced susceptibility. A _T_^{3} dependence follows from the Wilson _s-d_ scattering model.[16]

While carrying out the resistivity measurements over a wider temperature range, we also noticed that the temperature dependence of _r_(_T_) appears to be similar to that of _A_-15 materials. It should be noted that in _A_-15 structure intermetallic compounds, such as Nb3Sn and Nb3Al, the resistivity can be fitted to the simple form expressed as[17]

\[\rho(T) = \rho_{0} + \rho_{1} T + \rho_{2}\exp[ - T_{0}/T]\,\,,\] (2)

where \rho_{0}, \rho_{1}, \rho_{2}, and T_{0} are constants independent of temperature T. Several mechanisms have been presented that lead to departures from the temperature dependence predicted by the simple theory of metals. Several theoretical models were considered in order to explain Eq. (2) but none was found to be satisfactory.[17] If one considers the possibility of scattering into the high-density band from the low-mass band, there is an additional contribution to the resistivity. Wilson has accounted for the fact that at high temperatures the resistivity is linear in T and at low temperatures there is an exponential dropoff, reflecting the absence of high-temperature phonons.[18]

Our experimental results of the resistivity of CuRh2S4 and CuRh2Se4 can also be described by Eq. (2) over the entire temperature ranges T_{c} < T < 300 K. We obtain \rho_{0} = 4.10 \times 10^{- 4}\Omega cm, \rho_{1} = 9.24 \times 10^{- 6}\Omega cm/K, \rho_{2} = 6.45 \times 10^{- 6}\Omega cm, and T_{0} = 81.49 K for CuRh2S4; \rho_{0} = 2.30 \times 10^{- 6}\Omega cm, \rho_{1} = 6.81 \times 10^{- 7}\Omega cm/K, \rho_{2} = 3.84 \times 10^{- 4}\Omega cm, and T_{0} = 115.6 K for CuRh2Se4. These resistivity coefficients are obtained by use of the least-squares fitting method. Our data indicate that the values of \rho_{0}, \rho_{1}, and \rho_{2} are much larger than those of _A_-15 materials because of the sintered samples for our measurements, while the values of T_{0} give the inherent values of these compounds.

### ac magnetic susceptibility and dc magnetic susceptibility

Figures 8 and 9 show the real part of the ac-magnetic susceptibility, \chi^{\prime}, as a function of temperature for the sintered bulk samples of CuRh2S4 and CuRh2Se4. The superconducting transitions are rather sharp as was observed in the resistivity data. This indicates high homogeneity of the samples. The magnitude of the diamagnetic susceptibilities indicates almost perfect diamagnetism after the demagnetizing-field corrections.

The demagnetizing-field corrections have been made as follows. The bulk susceptibility \chi was measured on a sintered sample with the form of a long rod with the applied magnetic field parallel to the long axis of the rod. We then use the following formulas:[19]

Figure 8: Real part of the ac magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature (1.6 < T < 10 K) for the sintered bulk sample CuRh2S4.

Figure 6: Log10[\rho(T) - \rho_{0}\rbrack vs \log_{10}T plot for CuRh2S4. The straight line is a fit of Eq. (1) to the data points using n = 3.1.

  \[\chi = \frac{\chi_{a}}{1 + N\chi_{a}}\;\;,\] (3) \[N = \frac{4\pi}{2(2m/\sqrt{\pi}) + 1}\;\;\;\;(\rm in\;\;cgs\;units)\;,\] (4) \[m = 3.893\;\;\;(\rm CuRh_{2}S_{4})\;,\] \[m = 3.647\;\;\;(\rm CuRh_{2}Se_{4})\;.\]

Here, \chi_{a} is defined as M = \chi_{a}H_{a}, where H_{a} is the applied field and M is the magnetization. The form of the demagnetization factor N in Eq. (3) is based on the theory of Sato and Ishii.[19] An approximate expression for the demagnetizing factor for a rectangular plate is used, where m is the dimensional ratio of the sample (see Ref. [19]).

The imaginary parts of the ac magnetic susceptibilities, \chi^{\prime\prime}, exhibit sharp maxima at the temperatures of the inflection in \chi^{\prime}. The transition temperatures in the susceptibilities are higher than those observed in the resistivity and the specific heat. The errors of temperature measurements in the ac susceptibilities presumably come from poor thermal contact between the sample and the thermometer.

dc magnetic susceptibilities, which refer to the magnetization M divided by a constant applied field of 10 kOe, M/H, were measured with the SQUID and are presented in Fig. 10. These results of the susceptibility are in fairly good agreement with those of former workers.[3] The gaps in data near 50 K indicate no good result. The experimental results showed a small and broad peak around 50 K associated with the paramagnetic-antiferromagnetic transition of a condensed film of oxygen[20] in the SQUID sample chamber, thus we omitted the unreliable data. At the lowest temperatures, M/H increased rapidly; this may arise from a small Curie contribution due to paramagnetic impurities. The data cannot be well fitted to any reasonable form over a wide temperature range. As a simple assumption, if we take the values of the temperature-independent molar susceptibilities, \chi_{0} at 300 K, the magnitudes of \chi_{0} are obtained as \chi_{0}(\rm CuRh_{2}Se_{4}) \sim 1.51\times 10^{-4} and \chi_{0}(\rm CuRh_{2}Se_{4}) \sim 9.9\times 10^{-5} emu/mol f.u. These susceptibilities include a diamagnetic term, \chi_{\rm core}, which has been evaluated to be -6.3\times 10^{-5} emu/mol f.u. for the similar normal-spinel compound CuIr_{2}S_{4}.[21]^{-}[24] The susceptibility \chi_{\rm core} is the orbital diamagnetism contribution due to ion cores and the value is well within reasonable limits.[25]

After the correction for the diamagnetic contribution, we can estimate the density of states at the Fermi energy N(\varepsilon_{F})^{\bullet} (for both spin directions) by using the relation

\[\chi_{m} = \mu_{B}^{2}N(\varepsilon_{F})^{\bullet}\;\;.\] (5)

The densities of states N(\varepsilon_{F})^{\bullet} are estimated to be 0.95 states/eV atom for CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 0.72 states/eV atom for CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. These values of N(\varepsilon_{F})^{\bullet} are about two times smaller than those estimated from the \gamma values of the specific heat, which will be described below.

### Specific heats

The temperature dependences of the specific heats of CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4} are shown in Figs. 11 and 12. Superconducting transitions take place at 4.64 and 3.37 K, respectively. It is noted that, unfortunately, some experimental errors are included in the result for CuRh_{2}Se_{4} just above T_{c}. Specific-heat results for these two samples are also displayed as C/T vs T^{2}. The dashed lines represent the extrapolations from the normal-state specific heats to T = 0 K. The C/T vs T^{2} plots yield fairly straight lines at low temperature. Here, the undulation around T \sim 5 K for CuRh_{2}Se_{4} in Fig. 12 comes from the experimental errors. The specific heats are well fitted by

\[C = \gamma T + \beta T^{3}\;\;.\]

Figure 10: (a) dc magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature for CuRh_{2}S_{4}, where M is the dc magnetization measured with the SQUID. (b) dc magnetic susceptibility of CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. The gaps in data near 50 K indicate no good result due to an oxygen contamination problem (see text).

Figure 9: Real part of the ac magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature (1.6<T<10 K) for the sintered bulk sample CuRh_{2}Se_{4}.

  The values of \gamma are extracted from the T\!=\!0 K intercept of the extrapolated lines. The magnitudes of \gamma are rather large, and give high densities of states at the Fermi surface.

From the value of \beta, we estimate the Debye temperature \Theta by using the relation

\[\beta\!=\!\frac{12\pi^{4}rN_{0}k_{B}}{5\Theta^{3}}\;\;,\] (7)

with r being the number of atoms per formula unit (r\!=\!7 for these materials), N_{0} Avogadro's number, and k_{B} Boltzmann's constant. Equation (7) yields \Theta\!=\!230 and 211 K for CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4}, respectively. The Debye temperatures of these compounds are rather small in comparison with the value of \Theta for an oxide spinel compound such as LiTi_{2}O_{4}.[26, 27] LiTi_{2}O_{4} has \beta\!=\!0.043 mJ/K^{4} mol f.u., giving \Theta\!=\!685 K.

The origin of this lower value of the Debye temperature in these compounds might be attributed to a rattling of the cations within a correspondingly large space between the sulfur anions.[28] In sulfides such as CuV_{2}S_{4},[29] CuRh_{2}S_{4}, and CuRh_{2}Se_{4}, the cations have a large space for moving in the sulfur anion network. Consequently, lattice vibrations can easily be excited in the crystal. The difference in the Debye temperature between the oxides and sulfides could come from this enhanced excitation of the cations in the sulfides. The magnitude of T_{c} increases in proportion to the Debye temperature on the basis of the BCS theory.

Figures 13 and 14 display the electronic specific heats after subtracting the lattice contributions C_{L}. The measurement was not extended below 1.6 K for CuRh_{2}S_{4} in Fig. 13. The small dots represent the extrapolated values from higher temperatures.

  

### Entropy and energy gap

Entropies S(T) = \int_{0}^{T}[(C - C_{L})/T\,]dT are obtained by measuring the area under the curve of (C - C_{L})/T vs T for CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4} in the normal and superconducting states as functions of temperature. The entropies decrease markedly on cooling below the superconducting transition temperatures.

The specific heat has the form

\[C = C_{L} + C_{es}\ ,\]

where C_{L} is the lattice contribution and is assumed to be identical to C_{L}( = \beta T^{3}). The electronic parts, C_{es}, of the specific heats in the superconducting state is plotted on a log scale vs T_{c}/T in Figs. 15 and 16. The electronic contribution C_{es} may be approximated according to the BCS theory,[30] for T < 0.5\,T_{c}, by

\[C_{es} = (a\gamma T_{c})\exp[ - bT_{c}/T]\ ,\]

where a and b are constants. They are listed in Table 1.

We extract a value for the electron-phonon interaction parameter \lambda_{ep} from the Coulomb repulsion parameter \mu^{\bullet} and the experimentally determined transition temperature T_{c} and the Debye temperature \Theta:[31]

\[\lambda_{ep} = \frac{1.04 + \mu^{\bullet}\ln(\Theta/1.45T_{c})}{(1 - 0.62\mu^{\bullet})\ln(\Theta/1.45T_{c}) - 1.04}\ .\]

Here we assume empirically \mu^{\bullet} = 0.13,[31] since T_{c} is less sensitive to \mu^{\bullet} than to \lambda_{ep}. Using Eq. (9), we obtain \lambda_{ep} = 0.683 (CuRh_{2}S_{4}) and \lambda_{ep} = 0.635 (CuRh_{2}Se_{4}). These results indicate that these two compounds can be classified as intermediate-coupled superconductors.

The enhancement of \gamma by the electron-phonon interaction is given by the relation[31]

\[\gamma = \frac{1}{3}k_{B}^{2}\pi^{2}N(\epsilon_{F})^{\bullet}\] (11) \[= \frac{1}{3}k_{B}^{2}\pi^{2}N(\epsilon_{F})(1 + \lambda_{ep})\ ,\]

where N(\epsilon_{F}) is the band-structure density of states at the Fermi level (for both spin directions). The value of N(\epsilon_{F}) is found to be N(\epsilon_{F}) = 0.901 states/eV atom for CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 0.964 states/eV atom for CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. The values of N(\epsilon_{F})^{\bullet} are 1.52 and 1.58 states/eV atom for CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4}, respectively. These values of N(\epsilon_{F})^{\bullet} are larger than those from the Pauli susceptibilities obtained from Eq. (5).

The specific-heat jump \Delta C from the normal to the superconducting states at T_{c} gives the normalized value \Delta C/(\gamma T_{c}). These values of the two compounds are listed in Table 1. The value of \Delta C/(\gamma T_{c}) for CuRh_{2}S_{4} is considerably larger than the BCS prediction of 1.43, and the value is slightly smaller than the BCS prediction for CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. These facts suggest that these compounds are not simple weak-coupled superconductors but are intermediate-coupled superconductors.

The thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(T) can be determined by the relationship[32, 33]

\[G_{N}(T) - G_{S}(T) = \int_{T}^{T_{c}}[S_{N}(T) - S_{S}(T)\,]dT\] (12) \[= [V_{m}/8\pi][H_{c}(T)]^{2}\ .\]

Using the value of the entropy difference, Eq. (12) was integrated graphically and the H_{c}(T) values were obtained by using the molar volume V_{m} given in Table 1. The critical fields at T = 0 K are found to be 704 Oe in CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 445 Oe in CuRh_{2}Se_{4}.

Figure 16: Reduced superconducting electronic specific heat C_{es}/\gamma T_{c} = (C - C_{L})/\gamma T_{c} of CuRh_{2}Se_{4} on a log scale vs T_{c}/T. The logarithms are to base 10.

Figure 15: Reduced superconducting electronic specific heat C_{es}/\gamma T_{c} \equiv (C - C_{L})/\gamma T_{c} of CuRh_{2}S_{4} on a log scale vs T_{c}/T. The logarithms are to base 10.

 On the other hand, the BCS theory predicts the magnitude of H_{c}(0) by the relation

\[H_{c}(0) = [\gamma T_{c}^{2}/(0.170V_{m})]^{1/2}\ .\] (13)

Taking the experimental values for both compounds into consideration Eq. (13) gives 680 Oe for CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 470 Oe for CuRh_{2}Se_{4}, which are close to the values from Eq. (12).

According to Goodman,[34] the value of the energy gap at T\!=\!0 can be obtained from the relation

\[\frac{2\Delta(0)}{k_{B}T_{c}} = \frac{4\pi}{\sqrt{3}}\left[\frac{H_{c}(0)^{2}V_{m}}{8\pi\gamma T_{ c}^{2}}\right]^{1/2}\ .\] (14)

Values of 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} are calculated by using this relation and are found to be 3.511 in CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 3.512 in CuRh_{2}Se_{4}, which are in very good agreement with the BCS prediction of 3.53.

### Upper critical field H_{c2}

Figure 17 shows the magnetization as a function of magnetic field at 4.5 K for CuRh_{2}S_{4} which is not far below the transition temperature (T_{c}\!=\!4.70 K). The initial magnetization curve for CuRh_{2}Se_{4} at 2.0 K is given in Fig. 18. The upper critical field H_{c2} can be extracted from the magnetization curve. The temperature dependence of H_{c2} is plotted in Fig. 19. Unfortunately, we have only obtained H_{c2} up to 10 kOe and 2.0 K because of instrumental limitations. In Fig. 19(b), the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic critical fields H_{c}(T) is also shown.

According to the theory of type-II superconductors, the upper critical field at T\!=\!0 can be estimated from the relation[35]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} Property & Units & CuRh_{2}S_{4} & CuRh_{2}Se_{4} \\ Lattice const. a & Å & 9.787 & 10.269 \\ u parameter & & 0.384 & 0.384 \\ V_{m} & cm^{3}/mol & 70.58 & 81.54 \\ T_{c} & K & 4.70 & 3.48 \\ \gamma & mJ/K^{2} mol f.u. & 25 & 26 \\ \partial & K & 230 & 211 \\ N(\varepsilon_{F}) & states/eV atom & 0.90 & 0.96 \\ (from \gamma) & & & 0.68 & 0.64 \\ \lambda_{op} & 10^{-4} emu/mol f.u. & 3.4 & 3.2 \\ S & \muV/K & + 25 & + 7.3 \\ (Seebeck) & & & 1.82 & 1.31 \\ \Delta C/(\gamma T_{c}) & & & 20.0 & 4.40 \\ C_{m-}(a\gamma T_{c})\exp[-bT_{c}/T] & & a\!=\!8.73 & a\!=\!3.00 \\ (T\!<\!0.5T_{c}) & & b\!=\!1.50 & b\!=\!1.02 \\ H_{c}(0) & Oe & 704 &  \[H_{c2}(0) = 0.693T_{c}(-dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}}\ ,\] (15)

assuming the dirty limit. Using this Eq. (15) the values of H_{c2} are found to be 20.0 and 4.40 kOe for CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4}, respectively. These values of H_{c2} are slightly smaller than those found by former workers,[9] where simple extrapolated values have been reported. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence length \xi_{\rm GL} can be estimated to be \xi_{\rm GL} = 128 A in CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 274 A in CuRh_{2}Se_{4} at T = 0 K from the relation[39]

\[H_{c2} = \frac{\phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi_{\rm GL}^{2}}\ ,\] (16)

where \phi_{0} = ch/2e = 2.07 \times 10^{-7} G cm^{2} is the quantum of flux. This is the highest field at which superconductivity can nucleate in the interior of bulk samples. The penetration depth \lambda can be determined from the relation

\[H(0) = \frac{\phi_{0}}{2\sqrt{2}\pi\lambda\xi_{\rm GL}}\ .\] (17)

The penetration depths \lambda at T = 0 K calculated from Eq. (17) are 2670 A in CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 1810 A in CuRh_{2}Se_{4}, respectively. The Ginzburg-Landau parameters \kappa = \lambda/\xi_{\rm GL} are found to be \kappa = 21 in CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 6.6 in CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. This indicates that both compounds are typical type-II superconductors.

The lower critical field at which magnetic flux first penetrates can be expressed as

\[H_{c1} = \frac{\phi_{0}{\rm ln}\kappa}{4\pi\lambda^{2}}\ .\] (18)

Estimated values are H_{c1} = 70 Oe in CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 95 Oe in CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. It is difficult to measure the values of H_{c1} accurately from the low-temperature magnetization curves.

### Deviation function of thermodynamic critical field

The deviations of the reduced thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(t)/H_{c}(0) from the parabola 1 - t^{2} are examined in order to check "coupling strength" (here t is the reduced temperature T/T_{c}). Figure 20 shows the analyzed results for CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4} with the theoretical value of 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} = 3.90, which was obtained by assuming \Delta(T)/\Delta^{\rm BCS}(T) = const. The only adjustable parameter in the model is this constant value, which provides a means of "scaling" the BCS gap.[40; 41] These results suggest that neither CuRh_{2}S_{4} nor CuRh_{2}Se_{4} is a strong-coupling superconductor but indicate that they are locat

### Coherence peak of 1/_T_1 for Cu NMR in CuRh_{2}S_{4}

The measured values of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time T1 of copper nuclei in CuRh_{2}S_{4} as a function of inverse temperature are shown in Fig. 21. The plot of 1/_T_1 as a function of temperature is also shown in Fig. 22. The transition temperature _T_e is reduced in the presence of the applied magnetic field of 11 kOe.

In the energy gap there are no available states at all, and the missing states are piled up on either side. At temperatures just below _T_e, the energy gap is still very narrow and <_k__B_T, so that the piled-up states on either side result in an appreciable increase of relaxation rate 1/_T_1 over that in the normal state. Then T1 decreases rapidly just below _T_e and then rapidly increases again further below _T_e. As can be seen in Fig. 22, we clearly find an enhancement effect in 1/_T_1. At lower temperatures, the gap becomes wider than _k__B_T, and the relaxation rate 1/_T_1 eventually exponentially approaches zero. The energy gap can also be estimated from this temperature dependence. The best fit of the data gives 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}_T_e = 3.60. This result is in reasonable agreement with the value obtained from Eq. (14) using the specific-heat results.[42]^{-}[43]

Below 100 K, in the normal state, the temperature dependence of 1/_T_1 follows a Korringa law with T1 = 0.44 s K. The value of the Knight shift has a weak temperature dependence. The magnitude of the Knight shift at Cu nuclei, which is extrapolated to T = 0 K, is estimated to be -0.088% due to the _d_-wave spin-polarization effect in Cu atoms. These results confirm CuRh_{2}S_{4} to be a simple Pauli paramagnet without appreciable electron-electron correlation.[14]

### Comparison with some other normal-spinel compounds

The magnetic properties of CuRh_{2}O_{4} can be adequately discussed on the basis of the ionic point of view. The valence of copper is Cu^{2+} and the rhodium Rh^{3+} is non-magnetic with a low-spin state in the filled t2g level. The Neel temperature of CuRh_{2}O_{4} is 24.0 K, below which the magnetic moments due to localized-spin Cu^{2+} (_s_ = \frac{1}{2}) become ordered.[45] CuCo_{2}S_{4} does not show superconductivity but stays metallic down to 0.05 K.[4]

Recently, a temperature-induced metal-insulator transition has been observed in CuIr_{2}S_{4} at 230 K.[21]^{-}[24] At around 230 K, CuIr_{2}S_{4} exhibits a structural phase transition from a low-temperature tetragonal phase (insulating) to a high-temperature cubic phase (metallic). There is no localized magnetic moment in either the insulating or metallic phase. On the other hand, CuIr_{2}Se_{4} stays metallic down to 0.5 K without any phase transition.[23]

The conducting and magnetic properties of CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4} have been explained using models for the electronic structure of thiospinels given by Lotgering and Van Stapele[3] and Goodenough.[1] The _p_-type metallic conduction is attributed to hole conduction in the valence band. The observation of a small and temperature-independent susceptibility can be explained by the absence of magnetic ions. Lotgering and co-workers[2, 3, 46] suggested that the valencies can be represented by the formula Cu^{+}Rh_{2}^{3+}S_{3}^{2-}S^{-} where S^{-} denotes a hole in the valence band. The lack of a cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion has been explained by the presence of Cu^{+} instead of Cu^{2+} on the A sites.[2, 3]

An alternative model presented by Goodenough[1, 47] assumed an ionic Cu^{2+}Rh_{2}^{3+}S_{4}^{2-} with a delocalization of the T2g orbitals of Cu^{2+} caused by the formation of a partially filled \sigma^{\star} band. For the thiospinels, cation-anion covalence can occur with both octahedral and tetrahedral ions. Because the sulfide ions have four nearest-neighbor cations, \sigma bonding is much stronger than \pi bonding and the partially filled band is composed of antibonding \sigma^{\star} states. It appears that the metallic conductivity in the thiospinels may be due to partially filled band states. If molecular orbitals are formed between the metal ions and the anions, the _T__R_e levels of the Cu^{2+} ions are no longer localized. Since these levels are responsible for any distortion produced at the Cu^{2+} on tetrahedral sites, delocalizing them would remove the driving force for the distortion.

Although our studies in this paper have focused on the

  characteristics of the superconductivity, it is our hope that our measurements presented here will also lead to fruitful discussion on the electronic structure of these compounds.

## IV Summary

In the normal state, this work gives \rho(300 K) = 8.0 x 10-3 O cm, \gamma = 25 mJ/mol K2, and \Theta = 230 K for CuRh_{2}S_{4}, and \rho(300 K) = 4.6 x 10-4 O cm, \gamma = 26 mJ/mol K2, and \Theta = 211 K for CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. In the superconducting state, our experimental study has shown that these spinel compounds are type-II superconductors with GL parameters of \kappa = 21 (CuRh_{2}S_{4}) and 6.6 (CuRh_{2}Se_{4}). For both compounds, the value of the gap ratio 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} gives values between 3.1 and 3.9 for various measurements. The copper nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate exhibits distinctly a coherence peak. These spinel compounds are not strong-coupling superconductors but are located between weak- and intermediate-coupling superconductors. The lower T_{c} of both these rhodium spinels, as compared to LiTi_{2}O_{4}, is probably due to the lower Debye temperatures \Theta we observe. The superconducting transition temperature T_{c} vs the electronic specific-heat constant \gamma is plotted for various specimens in Fig. 23. The solid circles indicate CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. This figure indicates that these sulfo- and selenospinels are most closest related to the molybdenum sulfide cheverl-phase materials.

###### Abstract

An extensive study of electrical resistivity, ac magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, specific heat, and NMR has been made on high purity samples of the spinel compounds CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. The superconducting transitions occur at 4.70 K in CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 3.48 K in CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. The magnetic susceptibilities show perfect diamagnetism in both compounds. Upper critical fields at T = 0 are estimated to be 20.0 and 4.40 kOe, the lower critical fields at T = 0 are 70 and 95 Oe, respectively. The thermodynamic critical fields at T = 0 are 704 Oe (CuRh_{2}S_{4}) and 445 Oe (CuRh_{2}Se_{4}). These values are obtained from the temperature dependence of the free energy. These compounds are type-II superconductors with Ginzburg-Landau parameters \kappa = 21 (CuRh_{2}S_{4}) and \kappa = 6.6 (CuRh_{2}Se_{4}) at T = 0. The electron-phonon coupling constants, \lambda_{\rm ep} = 0.68 (CuRh_{2}S_{4}) and \lambda_{\rm ep} = 0.64 (CuRh_{2}Se_{4}), are obtained using the McMillan formula. The copper nuclear-spin-relaxation rate as a function of temperature shows a pronounced coherence peak just below T_{c} for CuRh_{2}S_{4}. Experimental results are analyzed on the basis of the BCS theory. These compounds exist between weak- and intermediate-coupling superconductors which are driven by electron-phonon interaction. The Debye temperatures \Theta of these materials are 230 K (CuRh_{2}S_{4}) and 211 K (CuRh_{2}Se_{4}).

## I Introduction

The ternary sulpho- and selenospinels CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4} have the cubic spinel structure (Fig. 1) at room temperature and have lattice constants of a = 9.787 and 10.269 A, respectively. They have the normal spinel structure where the Cu ions occupy the A (tetrahedral) sites and the Rh ions occupy the B (octahedral) sites. The trivalent Rh ions at B sites are in the low-spin state (4d6:1d_6, e6) with no magnetic moment in a strong crystalline field. The valence of Cu has been the subject of controversy.[1, 2]

The ternary sulpho- and selenospinels CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4} show metallic conduction and nearly temperature-independent susceptibility. The electrical and magnetic properties of these compounds at high temperatures have been discussed by Lotgering and Van Staple.[3]

On the other hand, it has been reported that these compounds CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4} reveal superconducting transitions between 3 and 4 K. Only brief reports have been given by earlier workers,[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and no detailed study and analysis associated with the superconductivity have been made so far to our knowledge.

In this paper, we report experiments designed to explore in greater detail the superconducting characteristics of these spinel compounds. In order to elucidate these characteristics with an emphasis on the low-temperature region, we have carried out the following measurements: the temperature dependences of (1) electrical resistivity \rho, (2) diamagnetic ac and dc susceptibilities \chi, (3) magnetization M, (4) specific heat, and (5) copper NMR. These experimental results are discussed in terms of the BCS theory.

In addition, the normal-state electrical, magnetic, and thermal properties are also examined. In particular, the electrical resistivities of these materials in the normal state have similar characteristics to _A_-15 compounds such as Nb_{3}Sn.

 

## II Experimental Methods

### Sample preparation

Mixtures of high-purity fine powders of Cu, Rh, S, or Se with nominal stoichiometry were heated in sealed quartz tubes at 850 degC for periods of 10 days. Subsequently, the specimens were reground and sintered in pressed parallelepiped form at 850 degC for 48 h. X-ray diffraction data confirm the spinel phase in these powder specimens. Samples with dimensions of about 2.0\times 2.0\times 10 mm^{3} were used for the measurements of \rho and ac susceptibility \chi. For the magnetization (M-H curves), the sample dimensions were 1.0\times 1.0\times 8.0 mm^{3} with the fields applied parallel to the longest dimension. The filling densities of a sintered bar sample are 70% (CuRh_{2}S_{4}) and 87% (CuRh_{2}Se_{4}) in comparison with the values of single crystals (theoretical density).

### Electrical resistivity measurements

The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity was measured over the temperature region between 1.5 and 285 K. The resistivity was measured by a standard four-probe method. Silver paste was used to fabricate the electrodes.

### ac magnetic susceptibility measurements

ac complex magnetic susceptibility, \chi=\chi^{\prime}-i\chi^{\prime\prime}, was measured by using a Hartshorn bridge and a two-phase lock-in amplifier in the temperature range between 1.6 and 285 K. The operating frequency was 80 Hz and the amplitude of the ac magnetic field was 1.0 Oe. A parallelepiped-shaped sample was used with the longest dimension parallel to the magnetic field. Demagnetizing-field corrections were made for the sample, assuming completely homogeneous sintering in the whole specimen. The magnitude of the corrections in \chi was evaluated to be less than 12%.

### Specific-heat measurements

The specific-heat measurements were done using a conventional ^{3}He cryostat. For specific heat, a standard heat-pulse technique was employed. The addenda included the thermometer, heater, glue, etc. The corrections due to the addenda were made. The specific-heat measurements were performed in the temperature ranges between 1.69 and 16.3 K for CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 0.60 and 15.2 K for CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. Several sintered samples with total masses of 0.828 g (CuRh_{2}S_{4}) and 1.262 g (CuRh_{2}Se_{4}) were used for these measurements.

### dc magnetization

The dc magnetization curves at constant temperatures and the temperature dependences of the magnetization at a constant applied magnetic field of 10 kOe were performed with a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). The values of upper critical field H_{c2} were obtained by the magnetization curves up to only 10 kOe because of the limits of our apparatus.

### Cu NMR in CuRh_{2}S_{4}

A conventional phase-coherent pulsed NMR apparatus was used for measurements of the spectra of Cu nuclei and the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time T_{1}.[12, 13] The samples were crushed into a fine powder for these measurements. The copper NMR spectrum was obtained by (a) sweeping the magnetic field while maintaining a constant frequency of 12.5 MHz and (b) maintaining a constant field of 11 kOe. The Knight shift was determined by the gyromagnetic ratio for ^{63}Cu and the reference value of metallic Cu. The T_{1} measurements were made down to 1.4 K. Detailed NMR experimental results will be published elsewhere.[14]

## III Results and Discussion

### X-ray powder diffraction

Figures 2 and 3 present the x-ray diffraction patterns at room temperature for the samples CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. As can be seen in Figs. 2 and 3, all the diffraction peaks have been indexed to the cubic unit cell. These indexed peaks have (h,k,l) values that are either all even or all odd, which is consistent with a fcc unit cell. Both samples are single phase.

### Electrical resistivity

Figures 4 and 5 show the resistivity as a function of temperature. With decreasing temperature, the resistivities \rho decrease monotonically with shallow upturned curvatures and abrupt superconducting transitions at 4.70

 and 3.48 K (midpoints) for the samples CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4}, respectively.

In CuRh_{2}S_{4}, the resistivity was measured with a current density of 0.47A/cm^{2}. The resistivity at 300 K is about 8 x 10^{-3}\Omega cm and the residual value of \rho_{0} is estimated to be 4.1 x 10^{-4}\Omega cm in the sintered specimen.

In the CuRh_{2}Se_{4} sample, the resistivity at 300 K is about 4.6 x 10^{-4}\Omega cm and just above T_{c} the resistivity \rho_{0} is about 2.3 x 10^{-6}\Omega cm. The data for CuRh_{2}Se_{4} are scattered at low temperatures because the resistivity becomes extremely small. Because of this low resistivity, a current density of 2.63 A/cm^{2} was used. It should be noted that such a high current density might suppress T_{c} slightly.

CuRh_{2}S_{4} has a 17 times larger resistivity than CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. The sample filling density is larger for CuRh_{2}Se_{4} than that of CuRh_{2}S_{4}. Furthermore, in the CuRh_{2}Se_{4} sample, the selenium anion has a larger ionic radius than that of sulfur and thus overlappings of the wave function between anions and cations are larger. Consequently, stronger covalent bonds and lower resistivity are expected for CuRh_{2}Se_{4}.

In the low-temperature range from T_{c} to 20 K, the \rho(T) of CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4} can be expressed well as a power law:  \[\rho(T) = \rho_{0} + \, A\, T^{n}\,\,,\] (1)

where A and n are constants. From the slope of the straight line in plots of \log_{10}[\rho(T) - \rho_{0}\rbrack vs \log_{10}T (Figs. 6 and 7), the value of n has been determined to be 3.1 and 2.8 for CuRh2S4 and CuRh2Se4. The temperature dependence of \rho(T) becomes weaker above 20 K. At high temperatures, \rho(T) tends to a linear function of T. The same behavior of the normal-state resistivity has been reported in the superconductor Th3Ni3Sn4.[15] The power law and the values of n close to 3.0 suggest that there exists a state density of d electrons at the Fermi energy, which is consistent with the spin fluctuation expected from the enhanced susceptibility. A _T_^{3} dependence follows from the Wilson _s-d_ scattering model.[16]

While carrying out the resistivity measurements over a wider temperature range, we also noticed that the temperature dependence of _r_(_T_) appears to be similar to that of _A_-15 materials. It should be noted that in _A_-15 structure intermetallic compounds, such as Nb3Sn and Nb3Al, the resistivity can be fitted to the simple form expressed as[17]

\[\rho(T) = \rho_{0} + \rho_{1} T + \rho_{2}\exp[ - T_{0}/T]\,\,,\] (2)

where \rho_{0}, \rho_{1}, \rho_{2}, and T_{0} are constants independent of temperature T. Several mechanisms have been presented that lead to departures from the temperature dependence predicted by the simple theory of metals. Several theoretical models were considered in order to explain Eq. (2) but none was found to be satisfactory.[17] If one considers the possibility of scattering into the high-density band from the low-mass band, there is an additional contribution to the resistivity. Wilson has accounted for the fact that at high temperatures the resistivity is linear in T and at low temperatures there is an exponential dropoff, reflecting the absence of high-temperature phonons.[18]

Our experimental results of the resistivity of CuRh2S4 and CuRh2Se4 can also be described by Eq. (2) over the entire temperature ranges T_{c} < T < 300 K. We obtain \rho_{0} = 4.10 \times 10^{- 4}\Omega cm, \rho_{1} = 9.24 \times 10^{- 6}\Omega cm/K, \rho_{2} = 6.45 \times 10^{- 6}\Omega cm, and T_{0} = 81.49 K for CuRh2S4; \rho_{0} = 2.30 \times 10^{- 6}\Omega cm, \rho_{1} = 6.81 \times 10^{- 7}\Omega cm/K, \rho_{2} = 3.84 \times 10^{- 4}\Omega cm, and T_{0} = 115.6 K for CuRh2Se4. These resistivity coefficients are obtained by use of the least-squares fitting method. Our data indicate that the values of \rho_{0}, \rho_{1}, and \rho_{2} are much larger than those of _A_-15 materials because of the sintered samples for our measurements, while the values of T_{0} give the inherent values of these compounds.

### ac magnetic susceptibility and dc magnetic susceptibility

Figures 8 and 9 show the real part of the ac-magnetic susceptibility, \chi^{\prime}, as a function of temperature for the sintered bulk samples of CuRh2S4 and CuRh2Se4. The superconducting transitions are rather sharp as was observed in the resistivity data. This indicates high homogeneity of the samples. The magnitude of the diamagnetic susceptibilities indicates almost perfect diamagnetism after the demagnetizing-field corrections.

The demagnetizing-field corrections have been made as follows. The bulk susceptibility \chi was measured on a sintered sample with the form of a long rod with the applied magnetic field parallel to the long axis of the rod. We then use the following formulas:[19]

Figure 8: Real part of the ac magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature (1.6 < T < 10 K) for the sintered bulk sample CuRh2S4.

Figure 6: Log10[\rho(T) - \rho_{0}\rbrack vs \log_{10}T plot for CuRh2S4. The straight line is a fit of Eq. (1) to the data points using n = 3.1.

  \[\chi = \frac{\chi_{a}}{1 + N\chi_{a}}\;\;,\] (3) \[N = \frac{4\pi}{2(2m/\sqrt{\pi}) + 1}\;\;\;\;(\rm in\;\;cgs\;units)\;,\] (4) \[m = 3.893\;\;\;(\rm CuRh_{2}S_{4})\;,\] \[m = 3.647\;\;\;(\rm CuRh_{2}Se_{4})\;.\]

Here, \chi_{a} is defined as M = \chi_{a}H_{a}, where H_{a} is the applied field and M is the magnetization. The form of the demagnetization factor N in Eq. (3) is based on the theory of Sato and Ishii.[19] An approximate expression for the demagnetizing factor for a rectangular plate is used, where m is the dimensional ratio of the sample (see Ref. [19]).

The imaginary parts of the ac magnetic susceptibilities, \chi^{\prime\prime}, exhibit sharp maxima at the temperatures of the inflection in \chi^{\prime}. The transition temperatures in the susceptibilities are higher than those observed in the resistivity and the specific heat. The errors of temperature measurements in the ac susceptibilities presumably come from poor thermal contact between the sample and the thermometer.

dc magnetic susceptibilities, which refer to the magnetization M divided by a constant applied field of 10 kOe, M/H, were measured with the SQUID and are presented in Fig. 10. These results of the susceptibility are in fairly good agreement with those of former workers.[3] The gaps in data near 50 K indicate no good result. The experimental results showed a small and broad peak around 50 K associated with the paramagnetic-antiferromagnetic transition of a condensed film of oxygen[20] in the SQUID sample chamber, thus we omitted the unreliable data. At the lowest temperatures, M/H increased rapidly; this may arise from a small Curie contribution due to paramagnetic impurities. The data cannot be well fitted to any reasonable form over a wide temperature range. As a simple assumption, if we take the values of the temperature-independent molar susceptibilities, \chi_{0} at 300 K, the magnitudes of \chi_{0} are obtained as \chi_{0}(\rm CuRh_{2}Se_{4}) \sim 1.51\times 10^{-4} and \chi_{0}(\rm CuRh_{2}Se_{4}) \sim 9.9\times 10^{-5} emu/mol f.u. These susceptibilities include a diamagnetic term, \chi_{\rm core}, which has been evaluated to be -6.3\times 10^{-5} emu/mol f.u. for the similar normal-spinel compound CuIr_{2}S_{4}.[21]^{-}[24] The susceptibility \chi_{\rm core} is the orbital diamagnetism contribution due to ion cores and the value is well within reasonable limits.[25]

After the correction for the diamagnetic contribution, we can estimate the density of states at the Fermi energy N(\varepsilon_{F})^{\bullet} (for both spin directions) by using the relation

\[\chi_{m} = \mu_{B}^{2}N(\varepsilon_{F})^{\bullet}\;\;.\] (5)

The densities of states N(\varepsilon_{F})^{\bullet} are estimated to be 0.95 states/eV atom for CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 0.72 states/eV atom for CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. These values of N(\varepsilon_{F})^{\bullet} are about two times smaller than those estimated from the \gamma values of the specific heat, which will be described below.

### Specific heats

The temperature dependences of the specific heats of CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4} are shown in Figs. 11 and 12. Superconducting transitions take place at 4.64 and 3.37 K, respectively. It is noted that, unfortunately, some experimental errors are included in the result for CuRh_{2}Se_{4} just above T_{c}. Specific-heat results for these two samples are also displayed as C/T vs T^{2}. The dashed lines represent the extrapolations from the normal-state specific heats to T = 0 K. The C/T vs T^{2} plots yield fairly straight lines at low temperature. Here, the undulation around T \sim 5 K for CuRh_{2}Se_{4} in Fig. 12 comes from the experimental errors. The specific heats are well fitted by

\[C = \gamma T + \beta T^{3}\;\;.\]

Figure 10: (a) dc magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature for CuRh_{2}S_{4}, where M is the dc magnetization measured with the SQUID. (b) dc magnetic susceptibility of CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. The gaps in data near 50 K indicate no good result due to an oxygen contamination problem (see text).

Figure 9: Real part of the ac magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature (1.6<T<10 K) for the sintered bulk sample CuRh_{2}Se_{4}.

  The values of \gamma are extracted from the T\!=\!0 K intercept of the extrapolated lines. The magnitudes of \gamma are rather large, and give high densities of states at the Fermi surface.

From the value of \beta, we estimate the Debye temperature \Theta by using the relation

\[\beta\!=\!\frac{12\pi^{4}rN_{0}k_{B}}{5\Theta^{3}}\;\;,\] (7)

with r being the number of atoms per formula unit (r\!=\!7 for these materials), N_{0} Avogadro's number, and k_{B} Boltzmann's constant. Equation (7) yields \Theta\!=\!230 and 211 K for CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4}, respectively. The Debye temperatures of these compounds are rather small in comparison with the value of \Theta for an oxide spinel compound such as LiTi_{2}O_{4}.[26, 27] LiTi_{2}O_{4} has \beta\!=\!0.043 mJ/K^{4} mol f.u., giving \Theta\!=\!685 K.

The origin of this lower value of the Debye temperature in these compounds might be attributed to a rattling of the cations within a correspondingly large space between the sulfur anions.[28] In sulfides such as CuV_{2}S_{4},[29] CuRh_{2}S_{4}, and CuRh_{2}Se_{4}, the cations have a large space for moving in the sulfur anion network. Consequently, lattice vibrations can easily be excited in the crystal. The difference in the Debye temperature between the oxides and sulfides could come from this enhanced excitation of the cations in the sulfides. The magnitude of T_{c} increases in proportion to the Debye temperature on the basis of the BCS theory.

Figures 13 and 14 display the electronic specific heats after subtracting the lattice contributions C_{L}. The measurement was not extended below 1.6 K for CuRh_{2}S_{4} in Fig. 13. The small dots represent the extrapolated values from higher temperatures.

  

### Entropy and energy gap

Entropies S(T) = \int_{0}^{T}[(C - C_{L})/T\,]dT are obtained by measuring the area under the curve of (C - C_{L})/T vs T for CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4} in the normal and superconducting states as functions of temperature. The entropies decrease markedly on cooling below the superconducting transition temperatures.

The specific heat has the form

\[C = C_{L} + C_{es}\ ,\]

where C_{L} is the lattice contribution and is assumed to be identical to C_{L}( = \beta T^{3}). The electronic parts, C_{es}, of the specific heats in the superconducting state is plotted on a log scale vs T_{c}/T in Figs. 15 and 16. The electronic contribution C_{es} may be approximated according to the BCS theory,[30] for T < 0.5\,T_{c}, by

\[C_{es} = (a\gamma T_{c})\exp[ - bT_{c}/T]\ ,\]

where a and b are constants. They are listed in Table 1.

We extract a value for the electron-phonon interaction parameter \lambda_{ep} from the Coulomb repulsion parameter \mu^{\bullet} and the experimentally determined transition temperature T_{c} and the Debye temperature \Theta:[31]

\[\lambda_{ep} = \frac{1.04 + \mu^{\bullet}\ln(\Theta/1.45T_{c})}{(1 - 0.62\mu^{\bullet})\ln(\Theta/1.45T_{c}) - 1.04}\ .\]

Here we assume empirically \mu^{\bullet} = 0.13,[31] since T_{c} is less sensitive to \mu^{\bullet} than to \lambda_{ep}. Using Eq. (9), we obtain \lambda_{ep} = 0.683 (CuRh_{2}S_{4}) and \lambda_{ep} = 0.635 (CuRh_{2}Se_{4}). These results indicate that these two compounds can be classified as intermediate-coupled superconductors.

The enhancement of \gamma by the electron-phonon interaction is given by the relation[31]

\[\gamma = \frac{1}{3}k_{B}^{2}\pi^{2}N(\epsilon_{F})^{\bullet}\] (11) \[= \frac{1}{3}k_{B}^{2}\pi^{2}N(\epsilon_{F})(1 + \lambda_{ep})\ ,\]

where N(\epsilon_{F}) is the band-structure density of states at the Fermi level (for both spin directions). The value of N(\epsilon_{F}) is found to be N(\epsilon_{F}) = 0.901 states/eV atom for CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 0.964 states/eV atom for CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. The values of N(\epsilon_{F})^{\bullet} are 1.52 and 1.58 states/eV atom for CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4}, respectively. These values of N(\epsilon_{F})^{\bullet} are larger than those from the Pauli susceptibilities obtained from Eq. (5).

The specific-heat jump \Delta C from the normal to the superconducting states at T_{c} gives the normalized value \Delta C/(\gamma T_{c}). These values of the two compounds are listed in Table 1. The value of \Delta C/(\gamma T_{c}) for CuRh_{2}S_{4} is considerably larger than the BCS prediction of 1.43, and the value is slightly smaller than the BCS prediction for CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. These facts suggest that these compounds are not simple weak-coupled superconductors but are intermediate-coupled superconductors.

The thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(T) can be determined by the relationship[32, 33]

\[G_{N}(T) - G_{S}(T) = \int_{T}^{T_{c}}[S_{N}(T) - S_{S}(T)\,]dT\] (12) \[= [V_{m}/8\pi][H_{c}(T)]^{2}\ .\]

Using the value of the entropy difference, Eq. (12) was integrated graphically and the H_{c}(T) values were obtained by using the molar volume V_{m} given in Table 1. The critical fields at T = 0 K are found to be 704 Oe in CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 445 Oe in CuRh_{2}Se_{4}.

Figure 16: Reduced superconducting electronic specific heat C_{es}/\gamma T_{c} = (C - C_{L})/\gamma T_{c} of CuRh_{2}Se_{4} on a log scale vs T_{c}/T. The logarithms are to base 10.

Figure 15: Reduced superconducting electronic specific heat C_{es}/\gamma T_{c} \equiv (C - C_{L})/\gamma T_{c} of CuRh_{2}S_{4} on a log scale vs T_{c}/T. The logarithms are to base 10.

 On the other hand, the BCS theory predicts the magnitude of H_{c}(0) by the relation

\[H_{c}(0) = [\gamma T_{c}^{2}/(0.170V_{m})]^{1/2}\ .\] (13)

Taking the experimental values for both compounds into consideration Eq. (13) gives 680 Oe for CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 470 Oe for CuRh_{2}Se_{4}, which are close to the values from Eq. (12).

According to Goodman,[34] the value of the energy gap at T\!=\!0 can be obtained from the relation

\[\frac{2\Delta(0)}{k_{B}T_{c}} = \frac{4\pi}{\sqrt{3}}\left[\frac{H_{c}(0)^{2}V_{m}}{8\pi\gamma T_{ c}^{2}}\right]^{1/2}\ .\] (14)

Values of 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} are calculated by using this relation and are found to be 3.511 in CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 3.512 in CuRh_{2}Se_{4}, which are in very good agreement with the BCS prediction of 3.53.

### Upper critical field H_{c2}

Figure 17 shows the magnetization as a function of magnetic field at 4.5 K for CuRh_{2}S_{4} which is not far below the transition temperature (T_{c}\!=\!4.70 K). The initial magnetization curve for CuRh_{2}Se_{4} at 2.0 K is given in Fig. 18. The upper critical field H_{c2} can be extracted from the magnetization curve. The temperature dependence of H_{c2} is plotted in Fig. 19. Unfortunately, we have only obtained H_{c2} up to 10 kOe and 2.0 K because of instrumental limitations. In Fig. 19(b), the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic critical fields H_{c}(T) is also shown.

According to the theory of type-II superconductors, the upper critical field at T\!=\!0 can be estimated from the relation[35]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} Property & Units & CuRh_{2}S_{4} & CuRh_{2}Se_{4} \\ Lattice const. a & Å & 9.787 & 10.269 \\ u parameter & & 0.384 & 0.384 \\ V_{m} & cm^{3}/mol & 70.58 & 81.54 \\ T_{c} & K & 4.70 & 3.48 \\ \gamma & mJ/K^{2} mol f.u. & 25 & 26 \\ \partial & K & 230 & 211 \\ N(\varepsilon_{F}) & states/eV atom & 0.90 & 0.96 \\ (from \gamma) & & & 0.68 & 0.64 \\ \lambda_{op} & 10^{-4} emu/mol f.u. & 3.4 & 3.2 \\ S & \muV/K & + 25 & + 7.3 \\ (Seebeck) & & & 1.82 & 1.31 \\ \Delta C/(\gamma T_{c}) & & & 20.0 & 4.40 \\ C_{m-}(a\gamma T_{c})\exp[-bT_{c}/T] & & a\!=\!8.73 & a\!=\!3.00 \\ (T\!<\!0.5T_{c}) & & b\!=\!1.50 & b\!=\!1.02 \\ H_{c}(0) & Oe & 704 &  \[H_{c2}(0) = 0.693T_{c}(-dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}}\ ,\] (15)

assuming the dirty limit. Using this Eq. (15) the values of H_{c2} are found to be 20.0 and 4.40 kOe for CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4}, respectively. These values of H_{c2} are slightly smaller than those found by former workers,[9] where simple extrapolated values have been reported. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence length \xi_{\rm GL} can be estimated to be \xi_{\rm GL} = 128 A in CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 274 A in CuRh_{2}Se_{4} at T = 0 K from the relation[39]

\[H_{c2} = \frac{\phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi_{\rm GL}^{2}}\ ,\] (16)

where \phi_{0} = ch/2e = 2.07 \times 10^{-7} G cm^{2} is the quantum of flux. This is the highest field at which superconductivity can nucleate in the interior of bulk samples. The penetration depth \lambda can be determined from the relation

\[H(0) = \frac{\phi_{0}}{2\sqrt{2}\pi\lambda\xi_{\rm GL}}\ .\] (17)

The penetration depths \lambda at T = 0 K calculated from Eq. (17) are 2670 A in CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 1810 A in CuRh_{2}Se_{4}, respectively. The Ginzburg-Landau parameters \kappa = \lambda/\xi_{\rm GL} are found to be \kappa = 21 in CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 6.6 in CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. This indicates that both compounds are typical type-II superconductors.

The lower critical field at which magnetic flux first penetrates can be expressed as

\[H_{c1} = \frac{\phi_{0}{\rm ln}\kappa}{4\pi\lambda^{2}}\ .\] (18)

Estimated values are H_{c1} = 70 Oe in CuRh_{2}S_{4} and 95 Oe in CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. It is difficult to measure the values of H_{c1} accurately from the low-temperature magnetization curves.

### Deviation function of thermodynamic critical field

The deviations of the reduced thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(t)/H_{c}(0) from the parabola 1 - t^{2} are examined in order to check "coupling strength" (here t is the reduced temperature T/T_{c}). Figure 20 shows the analyzed results for CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4} with the theoretical value of 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} = 3.90, which was obtained by assuming \Delta(T)/\Delta^{\rm BCS}(T) = const. The only adjustable parameter in the model is this constant value, which provides a means of "scaling" the BCS gap.[40; 41] These results suggest that neither CuRh_{2}S_{4} nor CuRh_{2}Se_{4} is a strong-coupling superconductor but indicate that they are locat

  ed between weak- and intermediate-coupling superconductors.

### Coherence peak of 1/_T_1 for Cu NMR in CuRh_{2}S_{4}

The measured values of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time T1 of copper nuclei in CuRh_{2}S_{4} as a function of inverse temperature are shown in Fig. 21. The plot of 1/_T_1 as a function of temperature is also shown in Fig. 22. The transition temperature _T_e is reduced in the presence of the applied magnetic field of 11 kOe.

In the energy gap there are no available states at all, and the missing states are piled up on either side. At temperatures just below _T_e, the energy gap is still very narrow and <_k__B_T, so that the piled-up states on either side result in an appreciable increase of relaxation rate 1/_T_1 over that in the normal state. Then T1 decreases rapidly just below _T_e and then rapidly increases again further below _T_e. As can be seen in Fig. 22, we clearly find an enhancement effect in 1/_T_1. At lower temperatures, the gap becomes wider than _k__B_T, and the relaxation rate 1/_T_1 eventually exponentially approaches zero. The energy gap can also be estimated from this temperature dependence. The best fit of the data gives 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}_T_e = 3.60. This result is in reasonable agreement with the value obtained from Eq. (14) using the specific-heat results.[42]^{-}[43]

Below 100 K, in the normal state, the temperature dependence of 1/_T_1 follows a Korringa law with T1 = 0.44 s K. The value of the Knight shift has a weak temperature dependence. The magnitude of the Knight shift at Cu nuclei, which is extrapolated to T = 0 K, is estimated to be -0.088% due to the _d_-wave spin-polarization effect in Cu atoms. These results confirm CuRh_{2}S_{4} to be a simple Pauli paramagnet without appreciable electron-electron correlation.[14]

### Comparison with some other normal-spinel compounds

The magnetic properties of CuRh_{2}O_{4} can be adequately discussed on the basis of the ionic point of view. The valence of copper is Cu^{2+} and the rhodium Rh^{3+} is non-magnetic with a low-spin state in the filled t2g level. The Neel temperature of CuRh_{2}O_{4} is 24.0 K, below which the magnetic moments due to localized-spin Cu^{2+} (_s_ = \frac{1}{2}) become ordered.[45] CuCo_{2}S_{4} does not show superconductivity but stays metallic down to 0.05 K.[4]

Recently, a temperature-induced metal-insulator transition has been observed in CuIr_{2}S_{4} at 230 K.[21]^{-}[24] At around 230 K, CuIr_{2}S_{4} exhibits a structural phase transition from a low-temperature tetragonal phase (insulating) to a high-temperature cubic phase (metallic). There is no localized magnetic moment in either the insulating or metallic phase. On the other hand, CuIr_{2}Se_{4} stays metallic down to 0.5 K without any phase transition.[23]

The conducting and magnetic properties of CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4} have been explained using models for the electronic structure of thiospinels given by Lotgering and Van Stapele[3] and Goodenough.[1] The _p_-type metallic conduction is attributed to hole conduction in the valence band. The observation of a small and temperature-independent susceptibility can be explained by the absence of magnetic ions. Lotgering and co-workers[2, 3, 46] suggested that the valencies can be represented by the formula Cu^{+}Rh_{2}^{3+}S_{3}^{2-}S^{-} where S^{-} denotes a hole in the valence band. The lack of a cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion has been explained by the presence of Cu^{+} instead of Cu^{2+} on the A sites.[2, 3]

An alternative model presented by Goodenough[1, 47] assumed an ionic Cu^{2+}Rh_{2}^{3+}S_{4}^{2-} with a delocalization of the T2g orbitals of Cu^{2+} caused by the formation of a partially filled \sigma^{\star} band. For the thiospinels, cation-anion covalence can occur with both octahedral and tetrahedral ions. Because the sulfide ions have four nearest-neighbor cations, \sigma bonding is much stronger than \pi bonding and the partially filled band is composed of antibonding \sigma^{\star} states. It appears that the metallic conductivity in the thiospinels may be due to partially filled band states. If molecular orbitals are formed between the metal ions and the anions, the _T__R_e levels of the Cu^{2+} ions are no longer localized. Since these levels are responsible for any distortion produced at the Cu^{2+} on tetrahedral sites, delocalizing them would remove the driving force for the distortion.

Although our studies in this paper have focused on the

  characteristics of the superconductivity, it is our hope that our measurements presented here will also lead to fruitful discussion on the electronic structure of these compounds.

## IV Summary

In the normal state, this work gives \rho(300 K) = 8.0 x 10-3 O cm, \gamma = 25 mJ/mol K2, and \Theta = 230 K for CuRh_{2}S_{4}, and \rho(300 K) = 4.6 x 10-4 O cm, \gamma = 26 mJ/mol K2, and \Theta = 211 K for CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. In the superconducting state, our experimental study has shown that these spinel compounds are type-II superconductors with GL parameters of \kappa = 21 (CuRh_{2}S_{4}) and 6.6 (CuRh_{2}Se_{4}). For both compounds, the value of the gap ratio 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} gives values between 3.1 and 3.9 for various measurements. The copper nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate exhibits distinctly a coherence peak. These spinel compounds are not strong-coupling superconductors but are located between weak- and intermediate-coupling superconductors. The lower T_{c} of both these rhodium spinels, as compared to LiTi_{2}O_{4}, is probably due to the lower Debye temperatures \Theta we observe. The superconducting transition temperature T_{c} vs the electronic specific-heat constant \gamma is plotted for various specimens in Fig. 23. The solid circles indicate CuRh_{2}S_{4} and CuRh_{2}Se_{4}. This figure indicates that these sulfo- and selenospinels are most closest related to the molybdenum sulfide cheverl-phase materials.
