###### Abstract

We report on the London penetration depth l_ab_(0), measurements, and second peak H determination in Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_YiCu2O8+_d_ (Bi-2212) crystals with different doping levels. By combining cationic substitutions and oxygen pressure annealing, crystals with a doping state going from the underdoped to overdoped regime have been obtained. The corresponding l_ab_(0) values, deduced from reversible magnetization measurements have allowed us to evidence a "boomerang" shape for the _T_c[1/l_ab_(0)] curve in the 0.8*_T_c/_T_cmax0<=1 region. Moreover, other _T_c[1/l_ab_(0)] values for superconducting crystals of Hg- and Tl-based cuprates are found to fit well with this boomerang path, demonstrating its universal nature. The overdoped side of the boomerang for the Bi-2212 crystals clearly shows that 1/l_ab_(0) decreases as the doping level is increased. Since by the same time the characteristic field of the fishtail H monotonously increases, we have thus established that H increases with 1/l_ab_(0) decreasing. Consequently, the linear relation H = _Ph_0/_l_ab_(0) predicted by the electromagnetic model cannot account alone for the present experimental results in the overdoped regime.

## I Introduction

In recent years, the large number of studies devoted to the superconducting cuprate Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+_d_ (Bi-2212) have enlightened the peculiar behavior of its magnetic phase diagram for the geometry **H**\left| \mathbf{c} \right.. One of the most intriguing features is the magnetic hysteresis anomaly, whose signature is a second peak on the magnetic hysteresis loop, that has also been observed in other many type-II high-temperature superconducting (HTSC) cuprates (see Ref. 1, and references therein), as well as in Ge/Pb superlattices [2] and organic superconductors. [3] The corresponding enhancement of the persistent current density in a field parallel to the c axis has been interpreted with models based on increased pinning by oxygen deficient sites, [4] effect of surface barriers, [5] vortex and defect matching, [6] and dimensional crossover. [7] In a highly anisotropic material such as Bi-2212, the mixed state can be described in terms of two-dimensional (2D) vortices (pancake vortices) which are confined to the CuO2 planes and are coupled from one layer to another by Josephson [8] and electromagnetic [9] coupling. When the coupling is strong enough, the concept of vortex line can then be meaningful. In Bi-2212, both muon-spin rotation (_m_SR) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments reveal a transition from a lattice of flux lines to a lattice of pancake vortices in a region of the (_H_,_T_) diagram which coincides with that where the magnetization second peak appears (see Ref. 10, and references therein). However, although such a dimensional crossover explanation for the fishtail feature is backed up by further experimental studies, [10] less is known about the underlying parameters which govern this transition. It is expected that for highly anisotropic compounds electromagnetic (em) coupling is the dominant coupling mechanism between pancake vortices. [9] In this case, a crossover behavior is expected for _B_cr values around _B_cr=_B_emem=Ph_0/l_ab_(0), where l_ab_ is the London magnetic penetration depth and Ph0 is the flux quantum. As the anisotropy g decreases, the tunneling Josephson current effect increases and it becomes predominant when _g_s<=l_ab_(0); a transition is therefore expected to occur at _B_cr=_B_j=Ph_0/(g_s_)2, where s describes a length scale in the c direction and is associated with the repeat distance between superconducting planes or group of planes (in Bi-2212, _s=c/2~15 A). [11]

As far as it is known, the vortex state in Bi-2212 is in the limit where electromagnetic coupling is dominant over the Josephson coupling. [9] Corroboration of this statement is given by both a recent magnetic relaxation measurement in Bi-2212 (Ref. 12) which predicted a transition at _B_cr = Ph_0/l_ab_2(0), and a _m_SR study [11] which also found such a linear relation between _B_cr and 1/l_ab_(0).

Nevertheless, this picture has to be compared to the "boomerang" path foreshadowed by Uemura _et al._, [13] and then completed through additional _m_SR experiments. [14; 15] In this case, starting from the most underdoped state, the zero temperature _m_SR relaxation rate \sigma(0)\propto n_{s}/m_{ab}^{\ast}\propto 1\Lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) (where n_{s} is the superconducting carrier pair density and m_{ab}^{\ast} is the in-plane effective mass) first increases as the doping state increases, then reaches a maximum value in the slightly overdoped region, and finally decreases as the doping level increases in the overdoped region. In other words, this _s_(0) turnback means that the curve _T_c[1/l_ab_(0)] exhibits a boomerang path. However, since the second peak field position regularly increases from the slightly underdoped to the strongly overdoped state (as shown, for instance by Kishio _et al._[16] for Bi-2212 crystals), one must clarify this discrepancy between the proposed linear _B_cr \approx 1\Lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) relation, the observed proportionality of this characteristic field with the doping state and the existence of a boomerang path for the _T_c[1/l_ab_(0)] curve.

  The growth of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Y_{x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta} (Bi[Y]-2212) crystals has allowed us to vary the doping state from underdoped to overdoped through the controlled substitution of Y^{3+} for Ca^{2+}. [17, 18] We have thus investigated the behavior of \lambda_{ab}(0), as obtained from magnetization measurements, with respect to the doping state for our series of Y-substituted Bi[Y]-2212 crystals. In this paper, we report on the evidence of a boomerang effect for the T_{c}[1\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0)] relation for Bi[Y]-2212 crystals whose doping state is controlled by both the Ca^{2+}/Y^{3+} substitution and also by oxygen pressure annealings. Our results suggest that for the most overdoped crystals, the second peak magnetic fields can no longer be explained with the electromagnetic model. However, comparison with more isotropic superconductors, such as Tl_{0.5}Pb_{0.5}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{7+\delta} (T[Pb]-1212), [19] Hg_{0.8}Cu_{0.2}Ba_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} (Hg[Cu]-1201), [20] and Hg_{0.8}V_{0.2}Ba_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} (Hg[V]-1201), [21] show that even the most overdoped Bi[Y]-2212 crystals remain strongly anisotropic superconductors in contrast with the thallium-based and mercury-based materials.

## II Experimental

The Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Y_{x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta} crystals used in this study were grown by a self-flux method which has been described elsewhere. [18] This earlier paper also described the structural investigations undertaken to check the quality of our crystals and to analyze their cationic compositions. In the following, the different compositions (x) of our Y-substituted single crystals will be referred to as the final analyzed crystal composition (x = 0.21, 0.28, 0.36, and 0.43). In summary, composition analyses were determined from energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) with a Kevex analyzer mounted on a 200 kV electron microscope. For each batch, a representative as-grown crystal exhibiting a typical T_{c} was crushed to prepare the grid for electron microscopy. The compositions were established by averaging the values obtained from EDS on at least twelve fragments. For each crystal, a slight scatter in the data for the Y/Ca ratio was observed. In particular, one must emphazise that this effect is maximum for the highest yttrium concentration (x = 0.43), and is estimated to 10%. This observation for x = 0.43 is consistent with its broad superconducting transition (\Delta\,T_{c}^{10-90\,\%}\sim 15 K) in comparison with the transition of all other crystals (0 \leqx\leq 0.36) that exhibit \Delta\,T_{c}^{10-90\,\%} values in the range 3-5 K. [18] Consequently, the result obtained for the x = 0.43 crystals precludes further extensive study on these composition. The resistivity along the c axis, denoted \rho_{c}, is determined by using a dc technique. Crystals were contacted by using a direct configuration. The contacts were made by attaching gold wires with a silver paint on evaporated silver stripes (two on each ab face of the crystal). The current is then applied along the c axis between two facing contacts and the voltage drop is measured parallel to it. This simple contacts configuration results in good estimate of \rho_{c}, as discussed in Ref. [22] for Bi-2212 crystals. The magnetic properties were investigated using a dc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer with magnetic fields up to 5.5 T along the c axis. For the experimental details of the reversible and irreversible measurements, see Ref. [18]. The \lambda_{ab}(T) values of our crystals are deduced in the framework of the London model [23] from measurements of the isothermal magnetization versus field M_{T}(H). A fit of these \lambda_{ab}(T) data in the BCS clean limit approximation [24] leads to the extrapolated \lambda_{ab}(0) values.

Concerning the irreversible measurements, the hysteresis loops of our crystals exhibit, at certain characteristic temperatures, the anomaly referred to as the fishtail effect. In the field-ascending branch, the peak of complete penetration at H_{p} is followed by an unexpected second peak at H_{\rm max}. A mirror image of this second peak is also observed on the reverse leg of the loop at H^{\prime}_{\rm max}\simH_{\rm max}. In previous studies, the H^{\prime}_{\rm max} value was found to characterize the fishtail effect (see Ref. [1], and references therein) and referred as H_{\rm SP} (SP: second peak). This latter was usually considered to be less temperature dependent in Bi-2212 with regard to the strong dependence of its value in less anisotropic compound such as YBaCuO. [4] Nevertheless it slightly increases as T decreases. On the opposite, the \bar{H} value corresponding to the dM/dH peak is found to saturate towards low temperature as reported previously. [25] Moreover the authors of Ref. [25] observed that this low temperature value of \bar{H} coincides with the \muSR crossover field B*(5 K). In the following we will thus refer to \bar{H} as the characteristic field of fishtail effect.

## III Results

Doping state in the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Y_{x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta} crystals

We have recently demonstrated [17, 18] that substitutions of low concentrations of Y^{3+} on the Ca^{2+} site lead to a set of samples with different T_{c} values. The final EDS determined Y contents x and their corresponding T_{c} values [18] are shown in Fig. 1. We have added the data of Y-rich crystals (x = 0.43) and those corresponding to crystals with x = 0, 0.21, 0.28, and 0.36 which have been strongly overdoped by annealing under oxygen pressure (P_{\rm O_{2}}= 100 bar, T = 540 ^{\circ}C, time= 12 h). We interpret this development of T_{c} around an optimum value of 91.5 K for the as-grown crystals (see Fig. 1) in terms of a competition between two distinct phenomena. As shown previously for ceramics, [26] the increase of x is accompanied by a continuous increase of the

Figure 1: T_{c} versus Y content x (deduced from EDS analysis) for crystals of the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Y_{x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta} series, as-grown (AG), and after annealing under oxygen pressure (P_{\rm O_{2}}).

  oxygen content. This oxygen uptake is too small to exactly compensate the Y3+/Ca2+ valence substitution, resulting in a regular decrease in the number of holes in the CuO2 planes as the Y content x increases. This mechanism of partial compensation tends to become less and less efficient as x increases. The initially, slightly overdoped Y-free Bi-2212 (_T_ = 82 K) can thus be driven to an optimum doping state, corresponding to x = 0.28 (_T_c = 91.5 K), and also to the underdoped regime for higher Y contents (_x_ = 0.43, _T_c = 86 K). This hypothesis of increasing oxygen content with increasing x in our crystals has been confirmed from both the study of the incommensurate modulation as reflected in the value of the q2 vector, and from transport measurements. The decrease of q2 with increasing x (_x_ = 0.21, q2 = 4.75 to x = 0.43, q2 = 4.53) [18] is comparable to the order of magnitude decrease observed in the x = 0 crystal with annealing (from q2 = 4.84 without annealing to q2 = 4.64 after annealing under oxygen pressure) (see Table 1). The similar decrease of q2 for both Y-substituted and Y-free Bi-2212 crystals supports the hypothesis of an increased oxygen uptake with increased Y concentrations and is consistent with results reported for ceramics.27 Moreover, previous studies in Y-free Bi-2212 crystals, report a systematic decrease of the out-of-plane resistivity _r_c (_T_ = 300 K) with increasing oxygen content.28,29 This has been ascribed to the improved metallicity of the [BiO]_x_ layers (_r_c decrease) as the oxygen content increases.30 We indeed observed a _r_c decrease from _r_c = 6 +- 2 O cm to _r_c ~ 0.9 O cm after heavily doping a x = 0 crystal, in agreement with results of Refs. 28 and 29. In this respect, although the doping level decreases as x increases, the monotonous _r_c decrease observed in the Bi[Y]-2212 crystals, (_x_ = 0, _r_c = 6 +- 2 O cm; x = 0.36, _r_c = 0.4 +- 0.1 O cm) (see Table 1) confirms that the oxygen content increases with x. As a result, the as-grown, heavily Y-substituted crystals (_x_ = 0.36 and x = 0.43) must already be strongly oxygenated, explaining why it is not possible to modify their _T_c by annealing under oxygen pressure (see Fig. 1).

So, the Y for Ca substitution, as well as oxygen doping, provide a good way to span the whole range of doping, from the heavily overdoped to the underdoped regime. Since the HTSC's are characterized by an approximately parabolic de

Here the curve corresponds to Eq. (1) assuming _T_c_c_th = 92 K. The p values of the different compositions x of the Bi[Y]-2212 crystals are thus deduced from the knowledge of their _T_c and doping state (UD:_p_ < 0.16, OD:_p_ > 0.16).

  pendence of T_{c} on the doping level, i.e., the hole concentration p, the above results on our Bi[Y]-2212 crystals can be summarized on a T_{c}(p) curve. Presland _et al._[31] showed that the relationship of T_{c}/T_{c}^{\rm max} to p is described by the parabola

\[T_{c}/T_{c}^{\rm max} = 1 - 82.6(p - 0.16)^{2},\]

which was first demonstrated for La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4 + \delta} data, but also describes other systems as well such as Bi_{1.9}Pb_{0.25}Sr_{2}Ca_{0.9}Cu_{2}O_{8 + \delta}[32] Although Kato _et al._[33] founded that in the Bi-2212 system the value of p_{\rm max}\sim0.05, at which T_{c} is maximum, is smaller than the 0.16 value of Eq. (1), the shape of the T_{c}(p) curve was found to be similar to that described by Eq. (1). Since we do not have direct information on the p values of our crystals, we have supposed that the relationship between T_{c} and the doping state in the Bi-2212 system, controlled through Y^{3+} for Ca^{2+} substitution and PO_{2} annealing, is also conveniently approximated by Eq. (1). Then, knowing that for x<0.28 our crystals are overdoped (see Fig. 1 and discussion above) and assuming T_{c}^{\rm max} to be 92 K, the corresponding p values are deduced from Eq. (1) for each kind of crystal. This allows us to draw qualitatively the T_{c}(p) curve for our crystals (see Fig. 2). Nevertheless, there remains an uncertainty concerning the nearly optimized x = 0.28 composition. The hypothesis that it is slightly underdoped (Fig. 2) will be confirmed in the following.

### T_{c}[1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0)]: "Boomerang"

The resulting \lambda_{ab}(0) data for the x = 0, 0.21, and 0.28 crystals annealed under oxygen pressure and for the x = 0, 0.21, 0.28, and 0.36 as-grown crystals of Ref. [18] are reported in Fig. 3 in the form T_{c}[1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0)] so that a direct comparison is possible with the \muSR data, i.e., T_{c}[\sigma(0)] with \sigma(0) \approx 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0). Nevertheless, since the absolute \lambda_{ab}(0) values are known to strongly depend on the way they have been determined, the comparison with \muSR data will remain qualitative. However, in order to validate the general trend of the observed T_{c}[1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0)] behavior, we also added on the plot of Fig. 3 data obtained from the same type of measurements, on different crystals with well-known doping states: optimized Hg_{0.8}Cu_{0.2}Ba_{2}CuO_{4 + \delta} (Hg[Cu]_{1201}, T_{c} = 96 K), [20] slightly overdoped Bi_{0.8}V_{0.8}Ba_{2}CuO_{4 + \delta} (Hg[V]_{1201}, T_{c} = 88 K), [21] and overdoped Tl_{0.5}Pb_{0.5}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{7 + \delta} (Tl[Pb]-1212, T_{c} = 80 K). [19] This T_{c} versus 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) curve clearly mimics the "boomerang path" observed by \muSR measurements. In the underdoped regime, 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) increases with T_{c} , and thus with the number of charge carriers p, which is consistent with the 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) \approxn_{s}/m* relation. In the optimally doped, as well as in the slightly overdoped region, 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) still increases with the carrier concentration; 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) reaches a maximum corresponding to \lambda_{ab}(0) = 1900 \pm 15 A, and then starts to decline with T_{c} whereas p continues to increase. Thus, in the overdoped region, although the normal state carrier concentration p increases, n_{s}/m* decreases. This was previously ascribed to the progressive reduction of pair lifetime arising from pair breaking. [14, 34]

Although an increase of 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) with increasing p is observed in the underdoped region for our crystals (see Fig. 3) as expected from previous studies, [13, 14, 15] the lack of data in this region precludes us from drawing any comparison concerning the evolution of 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) with T_{c} to the 'Uemura plot". [13] Nevertheless, in the overdoped region, 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) decreases quasilinearly with T_{c} as has been previously reported on overdoped ceramics of Tl-2201 (Ref. [14]) from \muSR measurements. The general shape of our boomerang curve suggests moreover that the nearly optimized x = 0.28 crystal is slightly underdoped, justifying its position in Fig. 2. Finally, the rather good fit of the data for Hg and Tl-based crystals with the Bi[Y]-2212 curve, agrees well with the expected universal behavior for HTCS's. [13, 14, 15, 34]

### Fishtail effect in Bi[Y]-2212, importance of the T_{c}[1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0)] boomerang

Although it is not well understood, a common trend tends to emerge for the relationship between the fishtail position and the doping level in the superconducting cuprates. For instance, it was shown that the carriers content increase by oxygen doping or by nonisovalent cationic substitution, shifts this line to higher fields for materials in the overdoped (OD) regime of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8 + \delta}, [16, 35, 36, 37, 35, 36, 37] Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6 + \delta}

Data corresponding to P_{0_{2}} annealed crystals (x = 0 and x = 0.21 P_{0_{2}}) are also added. The dotted lines are just guide for the eyes.

  (Tl-2201),[38] and (La1-_x_Sr_x_)2CuO4 (La-214).[39] But the effect of increasing hole concentrations through anionic or cationic doping must be studied over the whole range of doping in a single system to draw out any general conclusion. A similar enhancement of the fishtail line as a response to an oxygen content increase is observed in the optimum region from the underdoped (UD) to the overdoped regime of YBa2Cu3O7-_d_[40] Another investigation of Sr doping in La-214 ranging from the UD to the OD regime supports the expected increase of the second peak field going from UD to OD regime although it did not reveal any regular behavior.[41] In the Bi-2212 system, the experimental difficulty in attaining materials in the UD regime limits this kind of study. Moreover, when this impediment has been overcome, although a transition line is still observed in _m_SR, no fishtail effect was observed in the UD region of Bi-2212,[25, 24] except near the optimum doping.[16] This emphasizes another interesting aspect of the Y substitution which is that hysteresis loops for our crystals exhibit a well-marked second peak around 20-30 K from UD to OD. The optimum composition (_x_ = 0.28) being the only exception [see Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)], the lack of a fishtail in this case has been previously related to high J_{c} values.[17] Figure 4(a) illustrates the temperature dependence of the _H_SP (H_{\max}^{\prime}) field, to be compared to the low-temperature saturation of the \widetilde{H} (_dM_/_dH_ peak) [see Fig. 4(b)], thus justifying the choice of this latter as the characteristic field for the fishtail effect as discussed in the experimental section.

It is evident from Fig. 4(b) that the value of \widetilde{H} is strongly composition dependent. This is emphasized in Fig. 5 where the low-temperature value of \widetilde{H} is plotted against the assumed p values of the crystals. One has to bear in mind here that the p values are only qualitative. Nevertheless, two main points emerge from this figure. First of all, the Y-free (_x_ = 0) crystal seems to stand apart from the behavior of the Y-substituted ones. Even though the fishtail values of the most overdoped crystals (_x_ = 0 _P_O2 and x = 0.21 _P_O2) tend to join each other for almost similar doping state, the \widetilde{H} values of the as-grown Y-free x = 0 and Y-substituted crystals corresponding to smaller doping levels, do not fall on the same \widetilde{H}(p) curve. The possibility to get two Bi-2212 crystals exhibiting different \widetilde{H} values though their hole carrier content p is the same emphasizes the difference between the Ca2+/Y3+ substituted crystals and the pure Ca Bi-2212 ones. Such an effect on the second peak suggests that p is not the only important parameter but that their different l_{b}(0) values (Fig. 3) may act on the pinning properties through the vortex-vortex interactions which is l_{b} dependent as previously reported from _m_SR study of Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_GdCu2O8+_d_ ceramics.[45] Secondly, in each series (Y-free and Y-substituted crystals), \widetilde{H} is found to regularly increase with p. On one hand, as x decreases in the Y-substituted series from x = 0.43 to x = 0.21, \widetilde{H} is found to increase from \widetilde{H} = 210 +- 20 G to \widetilde{H} = 380 +- 20 G. Furthermore, by oxygen pressure annealing, the obtained value for the most overdoped crystal of the series (_x_ = 0.21) keeps increasing and continues the \widetilde{H}(p) curve. On the other hand, the same trend, that is to say an \widetilde{H} increase with p is observed for the most overdoped Y-free crystal (_x_ = 0 _P_O2), a larger \widetilde{H} (\widetilde{H} = 500 +- 30 G) value is obtained, to be compared to \widetilde{H} = 240 +- 10 G for the as-grown crystal.

At this stage of the study it commands attention that the continuous increase of \widetilde{H} with p, from the UD regime (_x_ = 0.43, x = 0.36) to the OD one (_x_ = 0.21, x = 0.21 _P_O2), together with the existence of a boomerang behavior of 1/_l__ab_(0) with p, when going from UD to OD regime through the optimum, clearly invalidate models solely invoking a 1/_l__ab_(0) dependence of \widetilde{H}. In particular, the boomerang existence leads to two different kinds of problems. The first one is that two crystals with a same London penetration depth value l_{b}(0) may be, respectively, UD and OD and thus have very different \widetilde{H} values. The second one is shown on Fig. 5 for x = 0 and x = 0.21 crystals. By oxygen pressure annealing, their overdoped character can be increased, leading to higher \widetilde{H} values, although 1/_l__ab_(0) decreases. Consequently, it is not surprising that our \widetilde{H}[1/_l__ab_(0)] data do not obey the \widetilde{H} = \Phi_{0}/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) relation which stands in the electromagnetic decoupling scenario (see Table 1). Clearly, the \widetilde{H}[1/_l__ab_(0)] variation for x = 0 and x = 0.21 (as-grown, _P_O2) indicated by arrows on Fig. 6 is totally opposite to that predicted by \widetilde{H} = \Phi_{0}/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0). Nevertheless, in this figure one can remark that less anisotropic superconducting cuprates (Hg[Cu]-1201, Hg[V]-1201, and Tl[Pb]-1212) exhibit larger \widetilde{H} values than that of Bi[Y]-2212 crystals. This suggests that for the most overdoped Bi cuprate exhibiting the highest \widetilde{H} value of this system, \widetilde{H} is not only driven by l__ab_(0) as suggested in the em model, but the anisotropy may be also important since it is probably decreased as the doping level is increased via oxygen pressure annealing. This result is consistent with the enhanced metallization of the insulating layers observed from resistivity measurements, which is a consequence of the introduction of oxygen in the BiO planes. Nevertheless, whatever its doping state, the values of the

  Bi-2212 system lie far from those of the more isotropic systems with similar number of [CuO_{2}]_{\kappa} layers but with thinner interlayers such as Tl[Pb]-1212 (see Fig. 6). Thus it clearly appears that the behavior of the Bi-2212 system, although its anisotropy is affected by Y substitution or P_{\rm O_{2}} annealing, remains far from those of more isotropic cuprates. This may explain why the anisotropy does not play the same role in the Bi-2212 system as for those systems as discussed in Ref. [9].

## IV Conclusion

The Y^{3+} for Ca^{2+} substitutions as well as P_{\rm O_{2}} annealing have allowed us to explore the doping state of the Bi-2212 crystals from the underdoped regime to the overdoped one through an optimum at T_{c}\sim91.5 K. A boomerang path T_{c}[1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0)] has been shown for these crystals. In particular, the overdoped region of the boomerang is characterized by a 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) decrease with doping level increase as already observed on many superconducting cuprates through \muSR measurements. However, for the corresponding overdoped crystals (x = 0 and x = 0.21) an increase of the fishtail characteristic field \vec{H} with the doping level is observed. Consequently, this \vec{H} increase as 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) decreases is totally opposite to the expected \vec{H} = \Phi_{0}/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) linear relation of the em model. Thus, the existence of the boomerang shape in Bi-2212 invalidates models which only involve \lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) as the underlying parameter determining the \vec{H} position [and its corresponding transition line in the (_H,T_) plane]. Finally, from these experimental results it clearly appears that other parameters must be also considered in order to interpret the fishtail of Bi-2212 such as the anisotropy and disorder as proposed in Refs. [43] and [44].

###### Abstract

We report on the London penetration depth l_ab_(0), measurements, and second peak H determination in Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_YiCu2O8+_d_ (Bi-2212) crystals with different doping levels. By combining cationic substitutions and oxygen pressure annealing, crystals with a doping state going from the underdoped to overdoped regime have been obtained. The corresponding l_ab_(0) values, deduced from reversible magnetization measurements have allowed us to evidence a "boomerang" shape for the _T_c[1/l_ab_(0)] curve in the 0.8*_T_c/_T_cmax0<=1 region. Moreover, other _T_c[1/l_ab_(0)] values for superconducting crystals of Hg- and Tl-based cuprates are found to fit well with this boomerang path, demonstrating its universal nature. The overdoped side of the boomerang for the Bi-2212 crystals clearly shows that 1/l_ab_(0) decreases as the doping level is increased. Since by the same time the characteristic field of the fishtail H monotonously increases, we have thus established that H increases with 1/l_ab_(0) decreasing. Consequently, the linear relation H = _Ph_0/_l_ab_(0) predicted by the electromagnetic model cannot account alone for the present experimental results in the overdoped regime.

## I Introduction

In recent years, the large number of studies devoted to the superconducting cuprate Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+_d_ (Bi-2212) have enlightened the peculiar behavior of its magnetic phase diagram for the geometry **H**\left| \mathbf{c} \right.. One of the most intriguing features is the magnetic hysteresis anomaly, whose signature is a second peak on the magnetic hysteresis loop, that has also been observed in other many type-II high-temperature superconducting (HTSC) cuprates (see Ref. 1, and references therein), as well as in Ge/Pb superlattices [2] and organic superconductors. [3] The corresponding enhancement of the persistent current density in a field parallel to the c axis has been interpreted with models based on increased pinning by oxygen deficient sites, [4] effect of surface barriers, [5] vortex and defect matching, [6] and dimensional crossover. [7] In a highly anisotropic material such as Bi-2212, the mixed state can be described in terms of two-dimensional (2D) vortices (pancake vortices) which are confined to the CuO2 planes and are coupled from one layer to another by Josephson [8] and electromagnetic [9] coupling. When the coupling is strong enough, the concept of vortex line can then be meaningful. In Bi-2212, both muon-spin rotation (_m_SR) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments reveal a transition from a lattice of flux lines to a lattice of pancake vortices in a region of the (_H_,_T_) diagram which coincides with that where the magnetization second peak appears (see Ref. 10, and references therein). However, although such a dimensional crossover explanation for the fishtail feature is backed up by further experimental studies, [10] less is known about the underlying parameters which govern this transition. It is expected that for highly anisotropic compounds electromagnetic (em) coupling is the dominant coupling mechanism between pancake vortices. [9] In this case, a crossover behavior is expected for _B_cr values around _B_cr=_B_emem=Ph_0/l_ab_(0), where l_ab_ is the London magnetic penetration depth and Ph0 is the flux quantum. As the anisotropy g decreases, the tunneling Josephson current effect increases and it becomes predominant when _g_s<=l_ab_(0); a transition is therefore expected to occur at _B_cr=_B_j=Ph_0/(g_s_)2, where s describes a length scale in the c direction and is associated with the repeat distance between superconducting planes or group of planes (in Bi-2212, _s=c/2~15 A). [11]

As far as it is known, the vortex state in Bi-2212 is in the limit where electromagnetic coupling is dominant over the Josephson coupling. [9] Corroboration of this statement is given by both a recent magnetic relaxation measurement in Bi-2212 (Ref. 12) which predicted a transition at _B_cr = Ph_0/l_ab_2(0), and a _m_SR study [11] which also found such a linear relation between _B_cr and 1/l_ab_(0).

Nevertheless, this picture has to be compared to the "boomerang" path foreshadowed by Uemura _et al._, [13] and then completed through additional _m_SR experiments. [14; 15] In this case, starting from the most underdoped state, the zero temperature _m_SR relaxation rate \sigma(0)\propto n_{s}/m_{ab}^{\ast}\propto 1\Lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) (where n_{s} is the superconducting carrier pair density and m_{ab}^{\ast} is the in-plane effective mass) first increases as the doping state increases, then reaches a maximum value in the slightly overdoped region, and finally decreases as the doping level increases in the overdoped region. In other words, this _s_(0) turnback means that the curve _T_c[1/l_ab_(0)] exhibits a boomerang path. However, since the second peak field position regularly increases from the slightly underdoped to the strongly overdoped state (as shown, for instance by Kishio _et al._[16] for Bi-2212 crystals), one must clarify this discrepancy between the proposed linear _B_cr \approx 1\Lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) relation, the observed proportionality of this characteristic field with the doping state and the existence of a boomerang path for the _T_c[1/l_ab_(0)] curve.

  The growth of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Y_{x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta} (Bi[Y]-2212) crystals has allowed us to vary the doping state from underdoped to overdoped through the controlled substitution of Y^{3+} for Ca^{2+}. [17, 18] We have thus investigated the behavior of \lambda_{ab}(0), as obtained from magnetization measurements, with respect to the doping state for our series of Y-substituted Bi[Y]-2212 crystals. In this paper, we report on the evidence of a boomerang effect for the T_{c}[1\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0)] relation for Bi[Y]-2212 crystals whose doping state is controlled by both the Ca^{2+}/Y^{3+} substitution and also by oxygen pressure annealings. Our results suggest that for the most overdoped crystals, the second peak magnetic fields can no longer be explained with the electromagnetic model. However, comparison with more isotropic superconductors, such as Tl_{0.5}Pb_{0.5}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{7+\delta} (T[Pb]-1212), [19] Hg_{0.8}Cu_{0.2}Ba_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} (Hg[Cu]-1201), [20] and Hg_{0.8}V_{0.2}Ba_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} (Hg[V]-1201), [21] show that even the most overdoped Bi[Y]-2212 crystals remain strongly anisotropic superconductors in contrast with the thallium-based and mercury-based materials.

## II Experimental

The Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Y_{x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta} crystals used in this study were grown by a self-flux method which has been described elsewhere. [18] This earlier paper also described the structural investigations undertaken to check the quality of our crystals and to analyze their cationic compositions. In the following, the different compositions (x) of our Y-substituted single crystals will be referred to as the final analyzed crystal composition (x = 0.21, 0.28, 0.36, and 0.43). In summary, composition analyses were determined from energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) with a Kevex analyzer mounted on a 200 kV electron microscope. For each batch, a representative as-grown crystal exhibiting a typical T_{c} was crushed to prepare the grid for electron microscopy. The compositions were established by averaging the values obtained from EDS on at least twelve fragments. For each crystal, a slight scatter in the data for the Y/Ca ratio was observed. In particular, one must emphazise that this effect is maximum for the highest yttrium concentration (x = 0.43), and is estimated to 10%. This observation for x = 0.43 is consistent with its broad superconducting transition (\Delta\,T_{c}^{10-90\,\%}\sim 15 K) in comparison with the transition of all other crystals (0 \leqx\leq 0.36) that exhibit \Delta\,T_{c}^{10-90\,\%} values in the range 3-5 K. [18] Consequently, the result obtained for the x = 0.43 crystals precludes further extensive study on these composition. The resistivity along the c axis, denoted \rho_{c}, is determined by using a dc technique. Crystals were contacted by using a direct configuration. The contacts were made by attaching gold wires with a silver paint on evaporated silver stripes (two on each ab face of the crystal). The current is then applied along the c axis between two facing contacts and the voltage drop is measured parallel to it. This simple contacts configuration results in good estimate of \rho_{c}, as discussed in Ref. [22] for Bi-2212 crystals. The magnetic properties were investigated using a dc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer with magnetic fields up to 5.5 T along the c axis. For the experimental details of the reversible and irreversible measurements, see Ref. [18]. The \lambda_{ab}(T) values of our crystals are deduced in the framework of the London model [23] from measurements of the isothermal magnetization versus field M_{T}(H). A fit of these \lambda_{ab}(T) data in the BCS clean limit approximation [24] leads to the extrapolated \lambda_{ab}(0) values.

Concerning the irreversible measurements, the hysteresis loops of our crystals exhibit, at certain characteristic temperatures, the anomaly referred to as the fishtail effect. In the field-ascending branch, the peak of complete penetration at H_{p} is followed by an unexpected second peak at H_{\rm max}. A mirror image of this second peak is also observed on the reverse leg of the loop at H^{\prime}_{\rm max}\simH_{\rm max}. In previous studies, the H^{\prime}_{\rm max} value was found to characterize the fishtail effect (see Ref. [1], and references therein) and referred as H_{\rm SP} (SP: second peak). This latter was usually considered to be less temperature dependent in Bi-2212 with regard to the strong dependence of its value in less anisotropic compound such as YBaCuO. [4] Nevertheless it slightly increases as T decreases. On the opposite, the \bar{H} value corresponding to the dM/dH peak is found to saturate towards low temperature as reported previously. [25] Moreover the authors of Ref. [25] observed that this low temperature value of \bar{H} coincides with the \muSR crossover field B*(5 K). In the following we will thus refer to \bar{H} as the characteristic field of fishtail effect.

## III Results

Doping state in the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Y_{x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta} crystals

We have recently demonstrated [17, 18] that substitutions of low concentrations of Y^{3+} on the Ca^{2+} site lead to a set of samples with different T_{c} values. The final EDS determined Y contents x and their corresponding T_{c} values [18] are shown in Fig. 1. We have added the data of Y-rich crystals (x = 0.43) and those corresponding to crystals with x = 0, 0.21, 0.28, and 0.36 which have been strongly overdoped by annealing under oxygen pressure (P_{\rm O_{2}}= 100 bar, T = 540 ^{\circ}C, time= 12 h). We interpret this development of T_{c} around an optimum value of 91.5 K for the as-grown crystals (see Fig. 1) in terms of a competition between two distinct phenomena. As shown previously for ceramics, [26] the increase of x is accompanied by a continuous increase of the

Figure 1: T_{c} versus Y content x (deduced from EDS analysis) for crystals of the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Y_{x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta} series, as-grown (AG), and after annealing under oxygen pressure (P_{\rm O_{2}}).

  oxygen content. This oxygen uptake is too small to exactly compensate the Y3+/Ca2+ valence substitution, resulting in a regular decrease in the number of holes in the CuO2 planes as the Y content x increases. This mechanism of partial compensation tends to become less and less efficient as x increases. The initially, slightly overdoped Y-free Bi-2212 (_T_ = 82 K) can thus be driven to an optimum doping state, corresponding to x = 0.28 (_T_c = 91.5 K), and also to the underdoped regime for higher Y contents (_x_ = 0.43, _T_c = 86 K). This hypothesis of increasing oxygen content with increasing x in our crystals has been confirmed from both the study of the incommensurate modulation as reflected in the value of the q2 vector, and from transport measurements. The decrease of q2 with increasing x (_x_ = 0.21, q2 = 4.75 to x = 0.43, q2 = 4.53) [18] is comparable to the order of magnitude decrease observed in the x = 0 crystal with annealing (from q2 = 4.84 without annealing to q2 = 4.64 after annealing under oxygen pressure) (see Table 1). The similar decrease of q2 for both Y-substituted and Y-free Bi-2212 crystals supports the hypothesis of an increased oxygen uptake with increased Y concentrations and is consistent with results reported for ceramics.27 Moreover, previous studies in Y-free Bi-2212 crystals, report a systematic decrease of the out-of-plane resistivity _r_c (_T_ = 300 K) with increasing oxygen content.28,29 This has been ascribed to the improved metallicity of the [BiO]_x_ layers (_r_c decrease) as the oxygen content increases.30 We indeed observed a _r_c decrease from _r_c = 6 +- 2 O cm to _r_c ~ 0.9 O cm after heavily doping a x = 0 crystal, in agreement with results of Refs. 28 and 29. In this respect, although the doping level decreases as x increases, the monotonous _r_c decrease observed in the Bi[Y]-2212 crystals, (_x_ = 0, _r_c = 6 +- 2 O cm; x = 0.36, _r_c = 0.4 +- 0.1 O cm) (see Table 1) confirms that the oxygen content increases with x. As a result, the as-grown, heavily Y-substituted crystals (_x_ = 0.36 and x = 0.43) must already be strongly oxygenated, explaining why it is not possible to modify their _T_c by annealing under oxygen pressure (see Fig. 1).

So, the Y for Ca substitution, as well as oxygen doping, provide a good way to span the whole range of doping, from the heavily overdoped to the underdoped regime. Since the HTSC's are characterized by an approximately parabolic de

Figure 2: _T_c /_T_c_ versus hole doping p for different as-grown Bi[Y]-2212 crystals with x = 0, 0.21, 0.28, 0.36, and 0.43, and for _P_O_2 annealed ones denoted _0_P_O_2, 0.21_P_O_3, and 0.28_P_O_2. Here the curve corresponds to Eq. (1) assuming _T_c_c_th = 92 K. The p values of the different compositions x of the Bi[Y]-2212 crystals are thus deduced from the knowledge of their _T_c and doping state (UD:_p_ < 0.16, OD:_p_ > 0.16).

  pendence of T_{c} on the doping level, i.e., the hole concentration p, the above results on our Bi[Y]-2212 crystals can be summarized on a T_{c}(p) curve. Presland _et al._[31] showed that the relationship of T_{c}/T_{c}^{\rm max} to p is described by the parabola

\[T_{c}/T_{c}^{\rm max} = 1 - 82.6(p - 0.16)^{2},\]

which was first demonstrated for La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4 + \delta} data, but also describes other systems as well such as Bi_{1.9}Pb_{0.25}Sr_{2}Ca_{0.9}Cu_{2}O_{8 + \delta}[32] Although Kato _et al._[33] founded that in the Bi-2212 system the value of p_{\rm max}\sim0.05, at which T_{c} is maximum, is smaller than the 0.16 value of Eq. (1), the shape of the T_{c}(p) curve was found to be similar to that described by Eq. (1). Since we do not have direct information on the p values of our crystals, we have supposed that the relationship between T_{c} and the doping state in the Bi-2212 system, controlled through Y^{3+} for Ca^{2+} substitution and PO_{2} annealing, is also conveniently approximated by Eq. (1). Then, knowing that for x<0.28 our crystals are overdoped (see Fig. 1 and discussion above) and assuming T_{c}^{\rm max} to be 92 K, the corresponding p values are deduced from Eq. (1) for each kind of crystal. This allows us to draw qualitatively the T_{c}(p) curve for our crystals (see Fig. 2). Nevertheless, there remains an uncertainty concerning the nearly optimized x = 0.28 composition. The hypothesis that it is slightly underdoped (Fig. 2) will be confirmed in the following.

### T_{c}[1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0)]: "Boomerang"

The resulting \lambda_{ab}(0) data for the x = 0, 0.21, and 0.28 crystals annealed under oxygen pressure and for the x = 0, 0.21, 0.28, and 0.36 as-grown crystals of Ref. [18] are reported in Fig. 3 in the form T_{c}[1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0)] so that a direct comparison is possible with the \muSR data, i.e., T_{c}[\sigma(0)] with \sigma(0) \approx 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0). Nevertheless, since the absolute \lambda_{ab}(0) values are known to strongly depend on the way they have been determined, the comparison with \muSR data will remain qualitative. However, in order to validate the general trend of the observed T_{c}[1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0)] behavior, we also added on the plot of Fig. 3 data obtained from the same type of measurements, on different crystals with well-known doping states: optimized Hg_{0.8}Cu_{0.2}Ba_{2}CuO_{4 + \delta} (Hg[Cu]_{1201}, T_{c} = 96 K), [20] slightly overdoped Bi_{0.8}V_{0.8}Ba_{2}CuO_{4 + \delta} (Hg[V]_{1201}, T_{c} = 88 K), [21] and overdoped Tl_{0.5}Pb_{0.5}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{7 + \delta} (Tl[Pb]-1212, T_{c} = 80 K). [19] This T_{c} versus 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) curve clearly mimics the "boomerang path" observed by \muSR measurements. In the underdoped regime, 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) increases with T_{c} , and thus with the number of charge carriers p, which is consistent with the 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) \approxn_{s}/m* relation. In the optimally doped, as well as in the slightly overdoped region, 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) still increases with the carrier concentration; 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) reaches a maximum corresponding to \lambda_{ab}(0) = 1900 \pm 15 A, and then starts to decline with T_{c} whereas p continues to increase. Thus, in the overdoped region, although the normal state carrier concentration p increases, n_{s}/m* decreases. This was previously ascribed to the progressive reduction of pair lifetime arising from pair breaking. [14, 34]

Although an increase of 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) with increasing p is observed in the underdoped region for our crystals (see Fig. 3) as expected from previous studies, [13, 14, 15] the lack of data in this region precludes us from drawing any comparison concerning the evolution of 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) with T_{c} to the 'Uemura plot". [13] Nevertheless, in the overdoped region, 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) decreases quasilinearly with T_{c} as has been previously reported on overdoped ceramics of Tl-2201 (Ref. [14]) from \muSR measurements. The general shape of our boomerang curve suggests moreover that the nearly optimized x = 0.28 crystal is slightly underdoped, justifying its position in Fig. 2. Finally, the rather good fit of the data for Hg and Tl-based crystals with the Bi[Y]-2212 curve, agrees well with the expected universal behavior for HTCS's. [13, 14, 15, 34]

### Fishtail effect in Bi[Y]-2212, importance of the T_{c}[1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0)] boomerang

Although it is not well understood, a common trend tends to emerge for the relationship between the fishtail position and the doping level in the superconducting cuprates. For instance, it was shown that the carriers content increase by oxygen doping or by nonisovalent cationic substitution, shifts this line to higher fields for materials in the overdoped (OD) regime of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8 + \delta}, [16, 35, 36, 37, 35, 36, 37] Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6 + \delta}

  (Tl-2201),[38] and (La1-_x_Sr_x_)2CuO4 (La-214).[39] But the effect of increasing hole concentrations through anionic or cationic doping must be studied over the whole range of doping in a single system to draw out any general conclusion. A similar enhancement of the fishtail line as a response to an oxygen content increase is observed in the optimum region from the underdoped (UD) to the overdoped regime of YBa2Cu3O7-_d_[40] Another investigation of Sr doping in La-214 ranging from the UD to the OD regime supports the expected increase of the second peak field going from UD to OD regime although it did not reveal any regular behavior.[41] In the Bi-2212 system, the experimental difficulty in attaining materials in the UD regime limits this kind of study. Moreover, when this impediment has been overcome, although a transition line is still observed in _m_SR, no fishtail effect was observed in the UD region of Bi-2212,[25, 24] except near the optimum doping.[16] This emphasizes another interesting aspect of the Y substitution which is that hysteresis loops for our crystals exhibit a well-marked second peak around 20-30 K from UD to OD. The optimum composition (_x_ = 0.28) being the only exception [see Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)], the lack of a fishtail in this case has been previously related to high J_{c} values.[17] Figure 4(a) illustrates the temperature dependence of the _H_SP (H_{\max}^{\prime}) field, to be compared to the low-temperature saturation of the \widetilde{H} (_dM_/_dH_ peak) [see Fig. 4(b)], thus justifying the choice of this latter as the characteristic field for the fishtail effect as discussed in the experimental section.

It is evident from Fig. 4(b) that the value of \widetilde{H} is strongly composition dependent. This is emphasized in Fig. 5 where the low-temperature value of \widetilde{H} is plotted against the assumed p values of the crystals. One has to bear in mind here that the p values are only qualitative. Nevertheless, two main points emerge from this figure. First of all, the Y-free (_x_ = 0) crystal seems to stand apart from the behavior of the Y-substituted ones. Even though the fishtail values of the most overdoped crystals (_x_ = 0 _P_O2 and x = 0.21 _P_O2) tend to join each other for almost similar doping state, the \widetilde{H} values of the as-grown Y-free x = 0 and Y-substituted crystals corresponding to smaller doping levels, do not fall on the same \widetilde{H}(p) curve. The possibility to get two Bi-2212 crystals exhibiting different \widetilde{H} values though their hole carrier content p is the same emphasizes the difference between the Ca2+/Y3+ substituted crystals and the pure Ca Bi-2212 ones. Such an effect on the second peak suggests that p is not the only important parameter but that their different l_{b}(0) values (Fig. 3) may act on the pinning properties through the vortex-vortex interactions which is l_{b} dependent as previously reported from _m_SR study of Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_GdCu2O8+_d_ ceramics.[45] Secondly, in each series (Y-free and Y-substituted crystals), \widetilde{H} is found to regularly increase with p. On one hand, as x decreases in the Y-substituted series from x = 0.43 to x = 0.21, \widetilde{H} is found to increase from \widetilde{H} = 210 +- 20 G to \widetilde{H} = 380 +- 20 G. Furthermore, by oxygen pressure annealing, the obtained value for the most overdoped crystal of the series (_x_ = 0.21) keeps increasing and continues the \widetilde{H}(p) curve. On the other hand, the same trend, that is to say an \widetilde{H} increase with p is observed for the most overdoped Y-free crystal (_x_ = 0 _P_O2), a larger \widetilde{H} (\widetilde{H} = 500 +- 30 G) value is obtained, to be compared to \widetilde{H} = 240 +- 10 G for the as-grown crystal.

At this stage of the study it commands attention that the continuous increase of \widetilde{H} with p, from the UD regime (_x_ = 0.43, x = 0.36) to the OD one (_x_ = 0.21, x = 0.21 _P_O2), together with the existence of a boomerang behavior of 1/_l__ab_(0) with p, when going from UD to OD regime through the optimum, clearly invalidate models solely invoking a 1/_l__ab_(0) dependence of \widetilde{H}. In particular, the boomerang existence leads to two different kinds of problems. The first one is that two crystals with a same London penetration depth value l_{b}(0) may be, respectively, UD and OD and thus have very different \widetilde{H} values. The second one is shown on Fig. 5 for x = 0 and x = 0.21 crystals. By oxygen pressure annealing, their overdoped character can be increased, leading to higher \widetilde{H} values, although 1/_l__ab_(0) decreases. Consequently, it is not surprising that our \widetilde{H}[1/_l__ab_(0)] data do not obey the \widetilde{H} = \Phi_{0}/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) relation which stands in the electromagnetic decoupling scenario (see Table 1). Clearly, the \widetilde{H}[1/_l__ab_(0)] variation for x = 0 and x = 0.21 (as-grown, _P_O2) indicated by arrows on Fig. 6 is totally opposite to that predicted by \widetilde{H} = \Phi_{0}/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0). Nevertheless, in this figure one can remark that less anisotropic superconducting cuprates (Hg[Cu]-1201, Hg[V]-1201, and Tl[Pb]-1212) exhibit larger \widetilde{H} values than that of Bi[Y]-2212 crystals. This suggests that for the most overdoped Bi cuprate exhibiting the highest \widetilde{H} value of this system, \widetilde{H} is not only driven by l__ab_(0) as suggested in the em model, but the anisotropy may be also important since it is probably decreased as the doping level is increased via oxygen pressure annealing. This result is consistent with the enhanced metallization of the insulating layers observed from resistivity measurements, which is a consequence of the introduction of oxygen in the BiO planes. Nevertheless, whatever its doping state, the values of the

  Bi-2212 system lie far from those of the more isotropic systems with similar number of [CuO_{2}]_{\kappa} layers but with thinner interlayers such as Tl[Pb]-1212 (see Fig. 6). Thus it clearly appears that the behavior of the Bi-2212 system, although its anisotropy is affected by Y substitution or P_{\rm O_{2}} annealing, remains far from those of more isotropic cuprates. This may explain why the anisotropy does not play the same role in the Bi-2212 system as for those systems as discussed in Ref. [9].

## IV Conclusion

The Y^{3+} for Ca^{2+} substitutions as well as P_{\rm O_{2}} annealing have allowed us to explore the doping state of the Bi-2212 crystals from the underdoped regime to the overdoped one through an optimum at T_{c}\sim91.5 K. A boomerang path T_{c}[1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0)] has been shown for these crystals. In particular, the overdoped region of the boomerang is characterized by a 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) decrease with doping level increase as already observed on many superconducting cuprates through \muSR measurements. However, for the corresponding overdoped crystals (x = 0 and x = 0.21) an increase of the fishtail characteristic field \vec{H} with the doping level is observed. Consequently, this \vec{H} increase as 1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) decreases is totally opposite to the expected \vec{H} = \Phi_{0}/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) linear relation of the em model. Thus, the existence of the boomerang shape in Bi-2212 invalidates models which only involve \lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) as the underlying parameter determining the \vec{H} position [and its corresponding transition line in the (_H,T_) plane]. Finally, from these experimental results it clearly appears that other parameters must be also considered in order to interpret the fishtail of Bi-2212 such as the anisotropy and disorder as proposed in Refs. [43] and [44].
