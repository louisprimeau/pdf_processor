## I Introduction

A hundred years ago, Friedrich Heusler found ferromagnetism in MnCu_{2}Al,1 a compound that does not contain any ferromagnetic elements. This compound is the prototype of the so-called Heusler materials, which crystallize in the cubic L2_{1} structure and have the general formula AT_{2}M. In the formula, A is generally a transition metal such as Sc, Ti, Y, Zr, Nb, and Hf but some of the smallest rare-earth elements and Mn also form the Heusler phase. T is a transition metal from groups VIIIB or IB of the periodic table, and M is typically an sp metal or the metalloids Sb and Bi. More than 100 ternary intermetallic compounds are known to form in the Heusler structure type, and due to the richness of their physical properties, they are one of the most interesting intermetallic families known. In this class of materials a wide variety of magnetic and electrical transport properties2-3 including magnetic ordering,4,5 heavy fermion behavior,6-10, shape memory effect,11 half-metallic ferromagnetism,12 and semimetallic4,5 behavior have been found. Moreover, several Heusler phases have been discovered to have a superconducting ground state (see Refs. [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]).

In general, the recipe for finding conventional intermetallic superconductors appears to be simple. One should correctly choose three different metals or metalloids, including a transition metal to ensure a high density of electronic states, to form a new compound. Correctly choosing metals means that one should generally avoid ferromagnetic elements and, according to the Matthias rule,21,22 the ratio of valence electrons/atom should be close to 5 or 7. The Heusler superconductors satisfy this recipe although their superconducting transition temperatures are relatively low. To date, to our knowledge, there are 28 compounds in the Heusler family known to be superconducting. A full list can be found in Table 1. Surprisingly, the coexistence of superconductivity and long-range magnetic ordering has also been found in ErPd_{2}Sn (Ref. [15]) and YbPd_{2}Sn.20 In general, despite significant experimental effort, it is still unclear what factor is the most important for superconductivity in Heusler phases. Here, by looking at the common trends of several characteristics such as lattice parameter, Debye temperature, density of states at the Fermi level, and electron-phonon coupling in the Heusler phases, we shed more light on this issue. We summarize and compare several physical properties of the superconducting Heusler compounds in the APd_{2}M family, focusing on two systems (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn and APd_{2}M, where A = Hf, Zr and M = Al, In. The analysis of the data shows the importance of the electron-phonon coupling for superconductivity in this family. Moreover, the superconducting parameters of the T_{c} record holder among the Heusler superconductors, YPd_{2}Sn, are also reported; these support some previous reports13 and add further information about the phase.

## II Experiment

Polycrystalline samples were prepared by arc-melting mixtures of the pure elements in an ultrapure argon atmosphere. Special care was taken to avoid oxygen contamination and therefore a large piece of Zr was used as a getter. The (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn and APd_{2}In (A = Zr, Hf) samples were annealed afterward in evacuated quartz tubes at 750 degC and 840 degC, respectively. The annealing temperature was held for two weeks before the tubes were quenched in -13 degC brine. Both resistivity and magnetization tests indicate that while for APd_{2}In (A = Zr, Hf) the annealing process improves the superconducting properties, for APd_{2}Al (A = Zr, Hf) the annealing treatment results in a lower, double superconducting transition. Therefore we present the physical properties of unannealed APd_{2}Al and annealed APd_{2}In.

ac magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and ac electrical resistivity were measured in a Quantum Design physical property measurement system. For the heat-capacity measurements, a standard relaxation calorimetry method was used. For the resistivity measurements we used a standard four-probe technique, with four platinum wires spot welded to the surface of each, previously polished, sample. dc magnetic measurements of the YPd_{2}Sn sample were performed using a commercial quantum interference device magnetometer (Quantum Design).

## III Results

The APd_{2}M (A = Zr, Hf; M = Al, In) and (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn samples were characterized before and after annealing by powder x-ray diffraction, carried out on a Scintag XDS 2000 diffractometer with Cu_K_a_ radiation (_l_ = 0.15460 nm). The Heusler compounds crystallize in the cubic L21 crystal structure (_Fm_3m, space group) and the A atom occupies site _4a_ (0,0,0), Pd occupies site _8c_ (\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4}), and M occupies site _4b_ (\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}). All atomic positions are fixed by symmetry. We used the fullprof package [23] to refine the x-ray-diffraction (XRD) patterns and the cubic lattice parameters a obtained are summarized in Table 2. These lattice parameters are very close to those reported in the literature. The XRD analysis confirms the good quality of the samples, although the broad diffraction peaks for HfPd2Al and ZrPd2Al may suggest either chemical inhomogeneity or difficulty in diffraction sample preparation.

The unit-cell size in the (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd2Sn family depends on the covalent radius of elemental Y, Lu, and Sc and is the largest for YPd2Sn and the smallest for ScPd2Sn. The relative covalent radii of Al and In account for the relative unit-cell sizes for HfPd2M and ZrPd2M (_M_ = Al, In). The unit cells of the HfPd2M compounds are smaller than those of the compounds containing Zr (ZrPd2_M_), likely caused by the slightly smaller covalent radius of the 5d metal Hf when compared to the 4d metal Zr.

The superconducting transition for YPd2Sn was first characterized via measurements of dc magnetic susceptibility in the field-cooling and zero-field-cooling modes (1 mT), and are shown in the main panel of Fig. 1. In order to estimate the demagnetization factor (_d_), low-field magnetization measurements as a function of field _M_(_H_) were performed at temperatures 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5 K as shown in the inset of Fig. 1. At low magnetic fields, the experimental data can be fit with the linear formula _M_fit = - a _H_. Assuming that the initial linear response to a magnetic field is perfectly diamagnetic (_d_ _M_/_dH_ = -1/4_p_), we obtained a demagnetization factor that is consistent with the sample shape.

In order to estimate lower critical field we followed the procedure used before for La3Ni4P4O2.[24] The _M_(_H_)-_M_fit data is plotted vs applied magnetic field (_H_) in the inset of Fig. 2. H^{*} is the field where M deviates by 2.5% above the fitted line (_M_fit). Taking into account the demagnetization factor, the lower critical field at temperature T, _m__{0}H_{c1}(T), can be calculated from the formula _m__{0}H_{c1}(T) = _m__{0}H^{*}(T)/(1-_d_). The main panel of Fig. 2 presents _m__{0}H_{c1} as a function of temperature. The estimation of _m__{0}H_{c1}(0) is possible by fitting experimental data to the formula _m__{0}H_{c1}(T) = _m__{0}H_{c1}(0)[1-(_T_/_T_c_)2], which is represented by the red solid line. The estimated zero-temperature lower critical field _m__{0}H_{c1}(0) = 10 mT, implies a Ginzburg-Landau superconducting penetration depth of approximately _l__{\text{GL}} = 196 nm. To the best of our knowledge, these superconducting parameters for YPd2Sn have not been previously reported.

  The superconducting transitions for all four APd_{2}M (A = Zr, Hf; M = Al, In) samples were characterized by measurements of ac susceptibility and electrical resistivity. Figure 3 presents the ac susceptibility versus temperature, measured with an applied \mu_{0}H_{\text{dc}} field of 0.5 mT and an applied \mu_{0}H_{\text{ac}} field of 0.3 mT. The left panel (a) presents the superconducting transition for ZrPd_{2}Al and HfPd_{2}Al. The highest T_{c} is observed for HfPd_{2}Al, although the double transition suggests inhomogeneity in this sample. Slightly lower T_{c} is observed for the samples containing In, HfPd_{2}In, and ZrPd_{2}In, which will be discussed later.

The superconducting transition was further examined through temperature-dependent measurements of the electrical resistivity [\rho(T)]. The whole temperature range of \rho(T) for YPd_{2}Sn is shown in the main panel of Fig. 4. The normal-state resistivity for YPd_{2}Sn reveals a metalliclike character (d\rho/dT>0), although the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) is rather low, \sim2.5. Such a low RRR is typical for the Heusler compounds, for example, the reported value of RRR for ZrNi_{2}Ga is about 2.25 The inset (a) of Fig. 4 shows the low-temperature resistivity \rho(T) under zero field and applied magnetic fields. A very sharp superconducting transition is observed for 0 and 0.1 T with the superconducting transition width \Delta T_{c} = 0.2 K. Knowing the values of T_{c} for different magnetic fields,26 we plot the upper critical field values, \mu_{0}H_{c2} vs temperature [see the inset (b) of Fig. 4]. The blue solid line through the data shows the best linear fit with the initial slope dH_{c2}/dT=-0.273 T/K. By using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH)27 expression for a dirty type-II superconductor,28 we estimate

\begin{table}

This value is comparable with the extracted H_{c2}(0) from Fig. 5 in Ref. [29] and is slightly lower than the 1.1 T reported in Ref. [13]. With this information, the coherence length can be calculated by using the Ginzburg-Landau formula \xi_{\rm GL}(0)=[\phi_{0}/2\pi\,H_{c2}(0)]^{1/2}, where \phi_{0}=h/2e. The obtained value of \xi_{\rm GL}(0)=19 nm, and hence the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa=10, which indicates that YPd_{2}Sn is a type-II superconductor. Using this parameter, and the relation H_{c1}H_{c2}=H_{c2}^{2}\ln{(\kappa)}, we determined the thermodynamic critical field \mu_{0}H_{c}(0)=62 mT.

Figure 5 shows the electrical resistivity in the vicinity of the superconducting transition for APd_{2}M (A= Hf, Zr; M= Al, In). The highest T_{c} and a very sharp onset of superconductivity (\Delta T_{c}<0.2 K) are observed for both ZrPd_{2}Al and HfPd_{2}Al. Through comparing the T_{c}'s in the group one can infer that Hf and Al promote superconductivity, while Zr and In cause lower T_{c}'s. A double superconducting transition is visible for ZrPd_{2}In. The inset of Fig. 5 presents the HfPd_{2}Al low-temperature resistivity [\rho(T)] for magnetic fields from 0 to 1.1 T, with a step of 0.1 T. The same procedure as described above for YPd_{2}Sn was employed in order to calculate the upper critical field (\mu_{0}H_{c2}) for all tested samples. We find the highest upper critical field for ZrPd_{2}Al and the lowest for ZrPd_{2}In, with the values of 2.82 and 0.63 T, respectively. The calculated coherence lengths, \xi_{\rm GL}(0), are 11 and 23 nm for ZrPd_{2}Al and ZrPd_{2}In, respectively; these values are comparable to those obtained in the (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn family.

The heat capacities measured through the superconducting transitions are shown in the main panel of Fig. 6 for YPd_{2}Sn and in Fig. 7(a) for both Al-containing compounds ZrPd_{2}Al and HfPd_{2}Al. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by sharp, large anomalies at temperatures that are consistent with the T_{c}'s determined by the dc or ac magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements. From the temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat (C_{\rm el}) below T_{c} we can extract a value for the superconducting gap by fitting the data to the expected BCS expectation:

\[C_{\rm BCS} = t\frac{d}{dT}\int_{0}^{\infty}dy\left(\frac{-6\gamma\,\Delta_{0} }{k_{B}\pi}\right)[f\,\ln{f}\] \[+(1-f)\ln(1-f)],\]

  where t=T/T_{c}, f is the Fermi function f=1/(\epsilon^{E/k_{B}T}+1), E=\sqrt{\epsilon^{2}+\Delta^{2}}y=\varepsilon/\Delta(0), and \Delta(T)/\Delta(0) is taken from the tabulated values by Muhlschlegel.[30] The results for YPd_{2}Sn and HfPd_{2}Al are shown in inset (a) of Fig. 6. The gap values are 0.83, 0.59, and 0.51 meV for YPd_{2}Sn, HfPd_{2}Al, and ZrPd_{2}Al (fit not shown here), respectively. This yields ratios of \Delta/k_{B}T_{c} = 2.05, 1.87, and 1.74, respectively, compared with the weak-coupling BCS expectation of 1.76, again indicating that YPd_{2}Sn is the strongest coupling superconductor in the family. This observation is in agreement with what is concluded in Ref. [13], where the ratio of \Delta/k_{B}T_{c} for YPd_{2}Sn was calculated to be between 2 and 2.25. The lower than expected value for ZrPd_{2}Al suggests that the sample is inhomogeneous and does not possess complete superconductivity.

Inset (b) of Fig. 6 and the panels (b) and (c) of Fig. 7 show the heat-capacity measurements, under applied magnetic field, for YPd_{2}Sn, APd_{2}Al, and APd_{2}In, respectively. The applied magnetic field of \mu_{0}H = 3 T was chosen to be above the upper critical field values. The experimental data can be fitted using the formula C_{p}=\gamma T+\beta T^{3}+\delta T^{5}. In this formula the first and two last parameters are the electronic and lattice contributions to the specific heat, respectively. The extracted Sommerfeld coefficients \gamma are between 6.4 and 10.9 mJ mol^{-1}K^{-2} and are in the range typical of the Heusler materials. Surprisingly, in the APd_{2}M (A = Hf, Zr; M = Al, In) family, the highest \gamma value is obtained for ZrPd_{2}In, the compound with the lowest T_{c}; equally surprising, the lowest \gamma was found for the best superconductor in the series, HfPd_{2}Al, contrary to the naive BCS expectations.

Using the Sommerfeld coefficient (\gamma), and the specific-heat jump value at the superconducting transition temperature (\Delta C), another important superconducting parameter \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} can be calculated. Due to low superconducting transition temperature, this calculation was not possible for ScPd_{2}Sn and ZrPd_{2}In. With one exception, for all other studied compounds \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} exceeds the BCS predicted 1.426 value, and reaches 1.73 for YPd_{2}Sn suggesting moderate or strong-coupling superconductivity in YPd_{2}Sn. The reason why \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} = 1.02 for the ZrPd_{2}Al compound is unknown, and might be caused by possible inhomogeneity of the superconducting phase as suggested by the broad superconducting transition visible in the ac magnetization measurement [see Fig. 3(a)], and lower than expected \Delta/k_{B}T_{c}.

A simple Debye model for the phonon contribution to the specific heat dictates that \beta is related to the Debye temperature through \Theta_{D}=[(12\pi^{4}/5\beta)n\,R]^{1/3}, where R = 8.314 J mol^{-1} K^{-1} and n = 4 is the number of atoms per formula unit. Using the observed values of \beta, we find that the Debye temperatures are 182 and 189 K for HfPd_{2}Al and ZrPd_{2}Al, respectively. Higher values of the Debye temperature were obtained for HfPd_{2}In and ZrPd_{2}In, where \Theta_{D} = 240 and 235 K, respectively. The similar Debye temperature for the compounds containing either Al (APd_{2}Al) or In (APd_{2}In), are likely due to similar unit-cell sizes. The observed trend of \Theta_{D} deviates from a simple mass relationship--the significantly heavier mass of In should lower \Theta_{D}. A similar surprising behavior is observed in the (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn series, in which the Debye temperature for LuPd_{2}Sn (\Theta_{D} = 246 K) is higher than that for YPd_{2}Sn (\Theta_{D} = 210 K). This suggests the presence of unexpectedly stiff In-Pd and Lu-Pd bonds in APd_{2}In (A = Zr, Hf) and LuPd_{2}Sn. An even lower value of Debye temperature (\Theta_{D} = 165 K) for YPd_{2}Sn was reported in Ref. [13].

With these results, assuming \mu^{*} = 0.13,[31] the electron-phonon coupling constant (\lambda_{\rm ep}) can be calculated from the inverted McMillan's formula:[32]

\[\lambda_{\rm ep}=\frac{1.04+\mu^{*}\ln\left(\frac{\theta_{0}}{1.45T_{c}} \right)}{(1-0.62\mu^{*})\ln\left(\frac{\theta_{D}}{1.45T_{c}}\right)-1.04}.\]

The inset (a) shows electronic specific heat C_{\rm el} (in a logarithmic scale) vs T_{c}/T for YPd_{2}Sn (green open circles) and HfPd_{2}Al (blue open squares). The lines represent the BCS fit as explained in the text, which allows us to estimate the superconducting gap value. The inset (b) presents C_{p}/T as a function of temperature, under applied magnetic field, for YPd_{2}Sn. The green line is the C_{p}/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4} fit at low-temperature range.

Right panel: specific heat divided by temperature (C_{p}/T) vs T^{2}, measured under magnetic field \mu_{0}H = 3 T, for (b) APd_{2}Al and (c) APd_{2}In, where A = Zr, Hf. The solid line is the C_{p}/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4} fit in the low-temperature range.

  The observed trend of \lambda_{\rm ep} in the APd_{2}M (A = Zr, Hf; M = Al, In) series is in agreement with the BCS theory; that is, a stronger electron-phonon coupling causes an increase of T_{c}. Similar behavior is observed for the (Y,Lu,Sc)Pd_{2}Sn system, which evolves from weak-coupling to moderate-coupling superconductivity as \lambda_{\rm ep} increases from 0.52 to 0.70. (Using a value of \mu^{*} of 0.15 causes an increase of \lambda_{\rm ep} to 0.75, which is very close to the reported increase of 0.79.[13] Having the Sommerfeld parameter and the electron-phonon coupling, the noninteracting density of states at the Fermi energy can be calculated from N(E_{F})=3\gamma/[\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}(1+\lambda_{\rm ep})]. The values obtained for all the APd_{2}M (A = Zr, Hf; M = Al, In) compounds varies from N(E_{F}) = 2.0 states eV^{-1} per f.u. (formula unit) to N(E_{F}) = 3.0 states eV^{-1} per f.u, for HfPd_{2}Al and ZrPd_{2}In, respectively. Samples containing Zr (ZrPd_{2}M) have greater N(E_{F}), an observation that may be worth investigating by band-structure calculations. In the (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn family, the lowest [N(E_{F}) = 1.79 states eV^{-1} per f.u.] and the largest [N(E_{F}) = 2.23 states eV^{-1} per f.u.] values were obtained for ScPd_{2}Sn and YPd_{2}Sn, respectively.

## IV Discussion

With the large number of Heusler superconductors known, it is possible to determine the influence of important materials parameters (i.e., the lattice constant, Debye temperature, Sommerfeld parameter, and electron-phonon coupling constant) on the superconducting critical temperature, T_{c}. Using available data, this can be done for seven superconductors in the APd_{2}M (A = Zr, Hf; M = Al, In) and (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn families.

Figure 8(a) shows T_{c} vs lattice constant a for the Heusler superconductors. For (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn a larger unit cell causes an increase of T_{c}. This has been discussed previously,[33] where it was used to introduce partial atomic disorder in YPd_{2}Sn in order to increase the lattice parameter, and as a result a higher T_{c} = 5.5 K was observed for Y_{0.96}Pd_{2.08}Sn_{0.96}. The same trend, but in the opposite direction, has also been discussed,[14] where a negative effect on T_{c} with applied hydrostatic pressure was reported. The authors of Ref. [14] suggest that the depression of T_{c} in RPd_{2}Z (R = Sc, Y, Tm, Yb, Lu, and Z = Sn, Pb) is due to a stiffening of the Pd sublattice with increasing pressure. The lattice parameter for the APd_{2}M (A = Zr, Hf; M = Al, In) system is smaller compared to (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn. ZrPd_{2}In has the largest lattice parameter in the first system, comparable to the one for ScPd_{2}Sn, which has the smallest a in the latter system. Interestingly, T_{c} vs a in the APd_{2}M (A = Zr, Hf; M = Al, In) system shows the opposite trend: decreasing the size of the unit cell causes an increase of T_{c}. Although such conflicting trends may reflect the presence of a sharp feature in the electronic density of states that results in an unexpected lattice size dependence of T_{c}, further experimental effort, such as studying the transition temperature under applied pressure for HfPd_{2}Al and ZrPd_{2}Al would be of interest, as would further theoretical consideration of this family.

The Debye temperature influences T_{c} in the same, although unexpected, fashion in the whole series. The BCS theory predicts that T_{c} should increase with increasing frequency of the lattice vibrations. For the Heusler phases, however, as is shown in Fig. 8(b), T_{c} decreases with the Debye temperature.

The next figure [Fig. 8(c)] presents the superconducting transition temperature versus the density of states at the Fermi energy, N(E_{f}). For the (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn subsystem (data represented by closed triangles) increasing N(E_{f}) rapidly increases T_{c}. Again the opposite trend is visible for APd_{2}M (data represented by closed circles). We conclude that T_{c} changes in a different way depending on the subsystem, similar to what is observed in Fig. 8(a).

The electron-phonon parameter, \lambda_{\rm ep}, is expected to increase T_{c} as well within the BCS explanation of intermetallic superconductors. This parameter is the one that unifies all the observations in the Heusler family of superconductors. The relationship ln T_{c} vs -1/\lambda_{\rm ep}, expected by the McMillian formula,[32] is shown in Fig. 9 for all seven studied compounds in this family. In the inset of Fig. 9, additional data points (open triangles) are shown. In particular, the low T_{c} (and low

  \lambda_{\rm ep}) points are for the Ni-based Heusler compounds for which \lambda_{\rm ep} values have been reported.[19, 25] These points fall on the McMillian relation drawn in the main panel of Fig. 9. It is worth noting that although the electron-phonon coupling has been calculated from the McMillian formula, and therefore T_{c} depends on \lambda_{\rm ep}, there is another variable (Debye temperature) in the formula, which is different for all compounds. Several strong-coupling superconductors with much higher T_{c}'s follow the same trend (Cu_{1.86}Mo_{6}S_{6} and Nb_{3}Sn).

## 5 Conclusions

A full list of 28 superconductors in the Heusler family, divided into groups with the same number of valence electrons (N), is presented in Table 1. Figure 10 presents the superconducting critical temperatures vs N per atom. Most of the compounds (19 members) belong to the group with 27 valence electrons per formula unit, which is equal to 6.75 electrons/atom. The record holder is YPd_{2}Sn, with T_{c} = 4.7 K (although one group reports a T_{c} with the highest value of 5.5 K for nonstoichiometric Y_{0.96}Pd_{2.08}Sn_{0.96}).[33] The blue solid line in Fig. 10 shows the trend in the YAu_{2-x}Pd_{x}In system, in which Au atoms can be fully replaced by Pd atoms, resulting in a continuous change of the valence electrons from 26 to 28.[18] Seven different compositions were studied and their T_{c}'s are shown as the stars in the figure. Fifty years ago, Matthias proposed that the superconducting critical temperature of pure elements has a maximum for the ratio of valence electrons/atom slightly below 5.[21] In a subsequent paper, he proposed the existence of two maxima, close to 5 and 7 valence electrons/atom.[22] Figure 10 suggests that the Heusler superconductors follow this empirical rule, with the most superconductors found at 6.75 electrons/atom, though the fact that superconductors are found for a range of electron counts indicates that electron count is not a hard parameter for determining T_{c} in this family. Surprisingly, there is only one data point for 6.5 electrons/atom in Fig. 6; thus that part of the family is not well characterized. The low T_{c} of the 6.5 electrons/atom compound suggests that this would not be a fruitful electron count to check for higher T_{c} Heusler superconductors, but before such a conclusion can be firmly drawn more compounds should be synthesized and tested. If the Heusler phase can be made stable at lower electron counts, then it would be of interest to check those materials for superconductivity to determine whether this family fully follows Matthias' empirical two-peak rule for intermetallic superconductors. Further, given the simplicity of the Heusler crystal structure, the large number of superconductors it hosts at different electron counts, and the clarity of the relationship between T_{c} and \lambda presented in Fig. 9, detailed theoretical modeling of this family of superconductors may be of significant interest.

## I Introduction

A hundred years ago, Friedrich Heusler found ferromagnetism in MnCu_{2}Al,1 a compound that does not contain any ferromagnetic elements. This compound is the prototype of the so-called Heusler materials, which crystallize in the cubic L2_{1} structure and have the general formula AT_{2}M. In the formula, A is generally a transition metal such as Sc, Ti, Y, Zr, Nb, and Hf but some of the smallest rare-earth elements and Mn also form the Heusler phase. T is a transition metal from groups VIIIB or IB of the periodic table, and M is typically an sp metal or the metalloids Sb and Bi. More than 100 ternary intermetallic compounds are known to form in the Heusler structure type, and due to the richness of their physical properties, they are one of the most interesting intermetallic families known. In this class of materials a wide variety of magnetic and electrical transport properties2-3 including magnetic ordering,4,5 heavy fermion behavior,6-10, shape memory effect,11 half-metallic ferromagnetism,12 and semimetallic4,5 behavior have been found. Moreover, several Heusler phases have been discovered to have a superconducting ground state (see Refs. [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]).

In general, the recipe for finding conventional intermetallic superconductors appears to be simple. One should correctly choose three different metals or metalloids, including a transition metal to ensure a high density of electronic states, to form a new compound. Correctly choosing metals means that one should generally avoid ferromagnetic elements and, according to the Matthias rule,21,22 the ratio of valence electrons/atom should be close to 5 or 7. The Heusler superconductors satisfy this recipe although their superconducting transition temperatures are relatively low. To date, to our knowledge, there are 28 compounds in the Heusler family known to be superconducting. A full list can be found in Table 1. Surprisingly, the coexistence of superconductivity and long-range magnetic ordering has also been found in ErPd_{2}Sn (Ref. [15]) and YbPd_{2}Sn.20 In general, despite significant experimental effort, it is still unclear what factor is the most important for superconductivity in Heusler phases. Here, by looking at the common trends of several characteristics such as lattice parameter, Debye temperature, density of states at the Fermi level, and electron-phonon coupling in the Heusler phases, we shed more light on this issue. We summarize and compare several physical properties of the superconducting Heusler compounds in the APd_{2}M family, focusing on two systems (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn and APd_{2}M, where A = Hf, Zr and M = Al, In. The analysis of the data shows the importance of the electron-phonon coupling for superconductivity in this family. Moreover, the superconducting parameters of the T_{c} record holder among the Heusler superconductors, YPd_{2}Sn, are also reported; these support some previous reports13 and add further information about the phase.

## II Experiment

Polycrystalline samples were prepared by arc-melting mixtures of the pure elements in an ultrapure argon atmosphere. Special care was taken to avoid oxygen contamination and therefore a large piece of Zr was used as a getter. The (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn and APd_{2}In (A = Zr, Hf) samples were annealed afterward in evacuated quartz tubes at 750 degC and 840 degC, respectively. The annealing temperature was held for two weeks before the tubes were quenched in -13 degC brine. Both resistivity and magnetization tests indicate that while for APd_{2}In (A = Zr, Hf) the annealing process improves the superconducting properties, for APd_{2}Al (A = Zr, Hf) the annealing treatment results in a lower, double superconducting transition. Therefore we present the physical properties of unannealed APd_{2}Al and annealed APd_{2}In.

ac magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and ac electrical resistivity were measured in a Quantum Design physical property measurement system. For the heat-capacity measurements, a standard relaxation calorimetry method was used. For the resistivity measurements we used a standard four-probe technique, with four platinum wires spot welded to the surface of each, previously polished, sample. dc magnetic measurements of the YPd_{2}Sn sample were performed using a commercial quantum interference device magnetometer (Quantum Design).

## III Results

The APd_{2}M (A = Zr, Hf; M = Al, In) and (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn samples were characterized before and after annealing by powder x-ray diffraction, carried out on a Scintag XDS 2000 diffractometer with Cu_K_a_ radiation (_l_ = 0.15460 nm). The Heusler compounds crystallize in the cubic L21 crystal structure (_Fm_3m, space group) and the A atom occupies site _4a_ (0,0,0), Pd occupies site _8c_ (\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4}), and M occupies site _4b_ (\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}). All atomic positions are fixed by symmetry. We used the fullprof package [23] to refine the x-ray-diffraction (XRD) patterns and the cubic lattice parameters a obtained are summarized in Table 2. These lattice parameters are very close to those reported in the literature. The XRD analysis confirms the good quality of the samples, although the broad diffraction peaks for HfPd2Al and ZrPd2Al may suggest either chemical inhomogeneity or difficulty in diffraction sample preparation.

The unit-cell size in the (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd2Sn family depends on the covalent radius of elemental Y, Lu, and Sc and is the largest for YPd2Sn and the smallest for ScPd2Sn. The relative covalent radii of Al and In account for the relative unit-cell sizes for HfPd2M and ZrPd2M (_M_ = Al, In). The unit cells of the HfPd2M compounds are smaller than those of the compounds containing Zr (ZrPd2_M_), likely caused by the slightly smaller covalent radius of the 5d metal Hf when compared to the 4d metal Zr.

The superconducting transition for YPd2Sn was first characterized via measurements of dc magnetic susceptibility in the field-cooling and zero-field-cooling modes (1 mT), and are shown in the main panel of Fig. 1. In order to estimate the demagnetization factor (_d_), low-field magnetization measurements as a function of field _M_(_H_) were performed at temperatures 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5 K as shown in the inset of Fig. 1. At low magnetic fields, the experimental data can be fit with the linear formula _M_fit = - a _H_. Assuming that the initial linear response to a magnetic field is perfectly diamagnetic (_d_ _M_/_dH_ = -1/4_p_), we obtained a demagnetization factor that is consistent with the sample shape.

In order to estimate lower critical field we followed the procedure used before for La3Ni4P4O2.[24] The _M_(_H_)-_M_fit data is plotted vs applied magnetic field (_H_) in the inset of Fig. 2. H^{*} is the field where M deviates by 2.5% above the fitted line (_M_fit). Taking into account the demagnetization factor, the lower critical field at temperature T, _m__{0}H_{c1}(T), can be calculated from the formula _m__{0}H_{c1}(T) = _m__{0}H^{*}(T)/(1-_d_). The main panel of Fig. 2 presents _m__{0}H_{c1} as a function of temperature. The estimation of _m__{0}H_{c1}(0) is possible by fitting experimental data to the formula _m__{0}H_{c1}(T) = _m__{0}H_{c1}(0)[1-(_T_/_T_c_)2], which is represented by the red solid line. The estimated zero-temperature lower critical field _m__{0}H_{c1}(0) = 10 mT, implies a Ginzburg-Landau superconducting penetration depth of approximately _l__{\text{GL}} = 196 nm. To the best of our knowledge, these superconducting parameters for YPd2Sn have not been previously reported.

  The superconducting transitions for all four APd_{2}M (A = Zr, Hf; M = Al, In) samples were characterized by measurements of ac susceptibility and electrical resistivity. Figure 3 presents the ac susceptibility versus temperature, measured with an applied \mu_{0}H_{\text{dc}} field of 0.5 mT and an applied \mu_{0}H_{\text{ac}} field of 0.3 mT. The left panel (a) presents the superconducting transition for ZrPd_{2}Al and HfPd_{2}Al. The highest T_{c} is observed for HfPd_{2}Al, although the double transition suggests inhomogeneity in this sample. Slightly lower T_{c} is observed for the samples containing In, HfPd_{2}In, and ZrPd_{2}In, which will be discussed later.

The superconducting transition was further examined through temperature-dependent measurements of the electrical resistivity [\rho(T)]. The whole temperature range of \rho(T) for YPd_{2}Sn is shown in the main panel of Fig. 4. The normal-state resistivity for YPd_{2}Sn reveals a metalliclike character (d\rho/dT>0), although the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) is rather low, \sim2.5. Such a low RRR is typical for the Heusler compounds, for example, the reported value of RRR for ZrNi_{2}Ga is about 2.25 The inset (a) of Fig. 4 shows the low-temperature resistivity \rho(T) under zero field and applied magnetic fields. A very sharp superconducting transition is observed for 0 and 0.1 T with the superconducting transition width \Delta T_{c} = 0.2 K. Knowing the values of T_{c} for different magnetic fields,26 we plot the upper critical field values, \mu_{0}H_{c2} vs temperature [see the inset (b) of Fig. 4]. The blue solid line through the data shows the best linear fit with the initial slope dH_{c2}/dT=-0.273 T/K. By using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH)27 expression for a dirty type-II superconductor,28 we estimate

This value is comparable with the extracted H_{c2}(0) from Fig. 5 in Ref. [29] and is slightly lower than the 1.1 T reported in Ref. [13]. With this information, the coherence length can be calculated by using the Ginzburg-Landau formula \xi_{\rm GL}(0)=[\phi_{0}/2\pi\,H_{c2}(0)]^{1/2}, where \phi_{0}=h/2e. The obtained value of \xi_{\rm GL}(0)=19 nm, and hence the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa=10, which indicates that YPd_{2}Sn is a type-II superconductor. Using this parameter, and the relation H_{c1}H_{c2}=H_{c2}^{2}\ln{(\kappa)}, we determined the thermodynamic critical field \mu_{0}H_{c}(0)=62 mT.

Figure 5 shows the electrical resistivity in the vicinity of the superconducting transition for APd_{2}M (A= Hf, Zr; M= Al, In). The highest T_{c} and a very sharp onset of superconductivity (\Delta T_{c}<0.2 K) are observed for both ZrPd_{2}Al and HfPd_{2}Al. Through comparing the T_{c}'s in the group one can infer that Hf and Al promote superconductivity, while Zr and In cause lower T_{c}'s. A double superconducting transition is visible for ZrPd_{2}In. The inset of Fig. 5 presents the HfPd_{2}Al low-temperature resistivity [\rho(T)] for magnetic fields from 0 to 1.1 T, with a step of 0.1 T. The same procedure as described above for YPd_{2}Sn was employed in order to calculate the upper critical field (\mu_{0}H_{c2}) for all tested samples. We find the highest upper critical field for ZrPd_{2}Al and the lowest for ZrPd_{2}In, with the values of 2.82 and 0.63 T, respectively. The calculated coherence lengths, \xi_{\rm GL}(0), are 11 and 23 nm for ZrPd_{2}Al and ZrPd_{2}In, respectively; these values are comparable to those obtained in the (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn family.

The heat capacities measured through the superconducting transitions are shown in the main panel of Fig. 6 for YPd_{2}Sn and in Fig. 7(a) for both Al-containing compounds ZrPd_{2}Al and HfPd_{2}Al. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by sharp, large anomalies at temperatures that are consistent with the T_{c}'s determined by the dc or ac magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements. From the temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat (C_{\rm el}) below T_{c} we can extract a value for the superconducting gap by fitting the data to the expected BCS expectation:

\[C_{\rm BCS} = t\frac{d}{dT}\int_{0}^{\infty}dy\left(\frac{-6\gamma\,\Delta_{0} }{k_{B}\pi}\right)[f\,\ln{f}\] \[+(1-f)\ln(1-f)],\]

  where t=T/T_{c}, f is the Fermi function f=1/(\epsilon^{E/k_{B}T}+1), E=\sqrt{\epsilon^{2}+\Delta^{2}}y=\varepsilon/\Delta(0), and \Delta(T)/\Delta(0) is taken from the tabulated values by Muhlschlegel.[30] The results for YPd_{2}Sn and HfPd_{2}Al are shown in inset (a) of Fig. 6. The gap values are 0.83, 0.59, and 0.51 meV for YPd_{2}Sn, HfPd_{2}Al, and ZrPd_{2}Al (fit not shown here), respectively. This yields ratios of \Delta/k_{B}T_{c} = 2.05, 1.87, and 1.74, respectively, compared with the weak-coupling BCS expectation of 1.76, again indicating that YPd_{2}Sn is the strongest coupling superconductor in the family. This observation is in agreement with what is concluded in Ref. [13], where the ratio of \Delta/k_{B}T_{c} for YPd_{2}Sn was calculated to be between 2 and 2.25. The lower than expected value for ZrPd_{2}Al suggests that the sample is inhomogeneous and does not possess complete superconductivity.

Inset (b) of Fig. 6 and the panels (b) and (c) of Fig. 7 show the heat-capacity measurements, under applied magnetic field, for YPd_{2}Sn, APd_{2}Al, and APd_{2}In, respectively. The applied magnetic field of \mu_{0}H = 3 T was chosen to be above the upper critical field values. The experimental data can be fitted using the formula C_{p}=\gamma T+\beta T^{3}+\delta T^{5}. In this formula the first and two last parameters are the electronic and lattice contributions to the specific heat, respectively. The extracted Sommerfeld coefficients \gamma are between 6.4 and 10.9 mJ mol^{-1}K^{-2} and are in the range typical of the Heusler materials. Surprisingly, in the APd_{2}M (A = Hf, Zr; M = Al, In) family, the highest \gamma value is obtained for ZrPd_{2}In, the compound with the lowest T_{c}; equally surprising, the lowest \gamma was found for the best superconductor in the series, HfPd_{2}Al, contrary to the naive BCS expectations.

Using the Sommerfeld coefficient (\gamma), and the specific-heat jump value at the superconducting transition temperature (\Delta C), another important superconducting parameter \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} can be calculated. Due to low superconducting transition temperature, this calculation was not possible for ScPd_{2}Sn and ZrPd_{2}In. With one exception, for all other studied compounds \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} exceeds the BCS predicted 1.426 value, and reaches 1.73 for YPd_{2}Sn suggesting moderate or strong-coupling superconductivity in YPd_{2}Sn. The reason why \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} = 1.02 for the ZrPd_{2}Al compound is unknown, and might be caused by possible inhomogeneity of the superconducting phase as suggested by the broad superconducting transition visible in the ac magnetization measurement [see Fig. 3(a)], and lower than expected \Delta/k_{B}T_{c}.

A simple Debye model for the phonon contribution to the specific heat dictates that \beta is related to the Debye temperature through \Theta_{D}=[(12\pi^{4}/5\beta)n\,R]^{1/3}, where R = 8.314 J mol^{-1} K^{-1} and n = 4 is the number of atoms per formula unit. Using the observed values of \beta, we find that the Debye temperatures are 182 and 189 K for HfPd_{2}Al and ZrPd_{2}Al, respectively. Higher values of the Debye temperature were obtained for HfPd_{2}In and ZrPd_{2}In, where \Theta_{D} = 240 and 235 K, respectively. The similar Debye temperature for the compounds containing either Al (APd_{2}Al) or In (APd_{2}In), are likely due to similar unit-cell sizes. The observed trend of \Theta_{D} deviates from a simple mass relationship--the significantly heavier mass of In should lower \Theta_{D}. A similar surprising behavior is observed in the (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn series, in which the Debye temperature for LuPd_{2}Sn (\Theta_{D} = 246 K) is higher than that for YPd_{2}Sn (\Theta_{D} = 210 K). This suggests the presence of unexpectedly stiff In-Pd and Lu-Pd bonds in APd_{2}In (A = Zr, Hf) and LuPd_{2}Sn. An even lower value of Debye temperature (\Theta_{D} = 165 K) for YPd_{2}Sn was reported in Ref. [13].

With these results, assuming \mu^{*} = 0.13,[31] the electron-phonon coupling constant (\lambda_{\rm ep}) can be calculated from the inverted McMillan's formula:[32]

\[\lambda_{\rm ep}=\frac{1.04+\mu^{*}\ln\left(\frac{\theta_{0}}{1.45T_{c}} \right)}{(1-0.62\mu^{*})\ln\left(\frac{\theta_{D}}{1.45T_{c}}\right)-1.04}.\]

The inset (a) shows electronic specific heat C_{\rm el} (in a logarithmic scale) vs T_{c}/T for YPd_{2}Sn (green open circles) and HfPd_{2}Al (blue open squares). The lines represent the BCS fit as explained in the text, which allows us to estimate the superconducting gap value. The inset (b) presents C_{p}/T as a function of temperature, under applied magnetic field, for YPd_{2}Sn. The green line is the C_{p}/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4} fit at low-temperature range.

Right panel: specific heat divided by temperature (C_{p}/T) vs T^{2}, measured under magnetic field \mu_{0}H = 3 T, for (b) APd_{2}Al and (c) APd_{2}In, where A = Zr, Hf. The solid line is the C_{p}/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4} fit in the low-temperature range.

  The observed trend of \lambda_{\rm ep} in the APd_{2}M (A = Zr, Hf; M = Al, In) series is in agreement with the BCS theory; that is, a stronger electron-phonon coupling causes an increase of T_{c}. Similar behavior is observed for the (Y,Lu,Sc)Pd_{2}Sn system, which evolves from weak-coupling to moderate-coupling superconductivity as \lambda_{\rm ep} increases from 0.52 to 0.70. (Using a value of \mu^{*} of 0.15 causes an increase of \lambda_{\rm ep} to 0.75, which is very close to the reported increase of 0.79.[13] Having the Sommerfeld parameter and the electron-phonon coupling, the noninteracting density of states at the Fermi energy can be calculated from N(E_{F})=3\gamma/[\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}(1+\lambda_{\rm ep})]. The values obtained for all the APd_{2}M (A = Zr, Hf; M = Al, In) compounds varies from N(E_{F}) = 2.0 states eV^{-1} per f.u. (formula unit) to N(E_{F}) = 3.0 states eV^{-1} per f.u, for HfPd_{2}Al and ZrPd_{2}In, respectively. Samples containing Zr (ZrPd_{2}M) have greater N(E_{F}), an observation that may be worth investigating by band-structure calculations. In the (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn family, the lowest [N(E_{F}) = 1.79 states eV^{-1} per f.u.] and the largest [N(E_{F}) = 2.23 states eV^{-1} per f.u.] values were obtained for ScPd_{2}Sn and YPd_{2}Sn, respectively.

## IV Discussion

With the large number of Heusler superconductors known, it is possible to determine the influence of important materials parameters (i.e., the lattice constant, Debye temperature, Sommerfeld parameter, and electron-phonon coupling constant) on the superconducting critical temperature, T_{c}. Using available data, this can be done for seven superconductors in the APd_{2}M (A = Zr, Hf; M = Al, In) and (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn families.

Figure 8(a) shows T_{c} vs lattice constant a for the Heusler superconductors. For (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn a larger unit cell causes an increase of T_{c}. This has been discussed previously,[33] where it was used to introduce partial atomic disorder in YPd_{2}Sn in order to increase the lattice parameter, and as a result a higher T_{c} = 5.5 K was observed for Y_{0.96}Pd_{2.08}Sn_{0.96}. The same trend, but in the opposite direction, has also been discussed,[14] where a negative effect on T_{c} with applied hydrostatic pressure was reported. The authors of Ref. [14] suggest that the depression of T_{c} in RPd_{2}Z (R = Sc, Y, Tm, Yb, Lu, and Z = Sn, Pb) is due to a stiffening of the Pd sublattice with increasing pressure. The lattice parameter for the APd_{2}M (A = Zr, Hf; M = Al, In) system is smaller compared to (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn. ZrPd_{2}In has the largest lattice parameter in the first system, comparable to the one for ScPd_{2}Sn, which has the smallest a in the latter system. Interestingly, T_{c} vs a in the APd_{2}M (A = Zr, Hf; M = Al, In) system shows the opposite trend: decreasing the size of the unit cell causes an increase of T_{c}. Although such conflicting trends may reflect the presence of a sharp feature in the electronic density of states that results in an unexpected lattice size dependence of T_{c}, further experimental effort, such as studying the transition temperature under applied pressure for HfPd_{2}Al and ZrPd_{2}Al would be of interest, as would further theoretical consideration of this family.

The Debye temperature influences T_{c} in the same, although unexpected, fashion in the whole series. The BCS theory predicts that T_{c} should increase with increasing frequency of the lattice vibrations. For the Heusler phases, however, as is shown in Fig. 8(b), T_{c} decreases with the Debye temperature.

The next figure [Fig. 8(c)] presents the superconducting transition temperature versus the density of states at the Fermi energy, N(E_{f}). For the (Sc, Y, Lu)Pd_{2}Sn subsystem (data represented by closed triangles) increasing N(E_{f}) rapidly increases T_{c}. Again the opposite trend is visible for APd_{2}M (data represented by closed circles). We conclude that T_{c} changes in a different way depending on the subsystem, similar to what is observed in Fig. 8(a).

The electron-phonon parameter, \lambda_{\rm ep}, is expected to increase T_{c} as well within the BCS explanation of intermetallic superconductors. This parameter is the one that unifies all the observations in the Heusler family of superconductors. The relationship ln T_{c} vs -1/\lambda_{\rm ep}, expected by the McMillian formula,[32] is shown in Fig. 9 for all seven studied compounds in this family. In the inset of Fig. 9, additional data points (open triangles) are shown. In particular, the low T_{c} (and low

The dotted and solid lines show the trend for the APd_{2}Sn (A = Y, Lu, Sc) and APd_{2}M (A = Zr, Hf; M = Al, In) systems, respectively.

The dashed line emphasizes the observed trend. In the inset, additional data points for selected intermetallic superconductors (open triangles) are shown. The low T_{c} (and low \lambda_{\rm ep}) points inside a square are for the Ni-based Heusler compounds (Refs. [19] and [25]).

  \lambda_{\rm ep}) points are for the Ni-based Heusler compounds for which \lambda_{\rm ep} values have been reported.[19, 25] These points fall on the McMillian relation drawn in the main panel of Fig. 9. It is worth noting that although the electron-phonon coupling has been calculated from the McMillian formula, and therefore T_{c} depends on \lambda_{\rm ep}, there is another variable (Debye temperature) in the formula, which is different for all compounds. Several strong-coupling superconductors with much higher T_{c}'s follow the same trend (Cu_{1.86}Mo_{6}S_{6} and Nb_{3}Sn).

## 5 Conclusions

A full list of 28 superconductors in the Heusler family, divided into groups with the same number of valence electrons (N), is presented in Table 1. Figure 10 presents the superconducting critical temperatures vs N per atom. Most of the compounds (19 members) belong to the group with 27 valence electrons per formula unit, which is equal to 6.75 electrons/atom. The record holder is YPd_{2}Sn, with T_{c} = 4.7 K (although one group reports a T_{c} with the highest value of 5.5 K for nonstoichiometric Y_{0.96}Pd_{2.08}Sn_{0.96}).[33] The blue solid line in Fig. 10 shows the trend in the YAu_{2-x}Pd_{x}In system, in which Au atoms can be fully replaced by Pd atoms, resulting in a continuous change of the valence electrons from 26 to 28.[18] Seven different compositions were studied and their T_{c}'s are shown as the stars in the figure. Fifty years ago, Matthias proposed that the superconducting critical temperature of pure elements has a maximum for the ratio of valence electrons/atom slightly below 5.[21] In a subsequent paper, he proposed the existence of two maxima, close to 5 and 7 valence electrons/atom.[22] Figure 10 suggests that the Heusler superconductors follow this empirical rule, with the most superconductors found at 6.75 electrons/atom, though the fact that superconductors are found for a range of electron counts indicates that electron count is not a hard parameter for determining T_{c} in this family. Surprisingly, there is only one data point for 6.5 electrons/atom in Fig. 6; thus that part of the family is not well characterized. The low T_{c} of the 6.5 electrons/atom compound suggests that this would not be a fruitful electron count to check for higher T_{c} Heusler superconductors, but before such a conclusion can be firmly drawn more compounds should be synthesized and tested. If the Heusler phase can be made stable at lower electron counts, then it would be of interest to check those materials for superconductivity to determine whether this family fully follows Matthias' empirical two-peak rule for intermetallic superconductors. Further, given the simplicity of the Heusler crystal structure, the large number of superconductors it hosts at different electron counts, and the clarity of the relationship between T_{c} and \lambda presented in Fig. 9, detailed theoretical modeling of this family of superconductors may be of significant interest.
