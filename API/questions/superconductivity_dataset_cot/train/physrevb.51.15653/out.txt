###### Abstract

We report the results of transport measurements on single-crystal YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin films grown by laser ablation. Matthiessen's rule is obeyed as a function of x at optimum doping (\delta\!-\!0.05), but is violated in underdoped samples, where there is evidence from the resistivity that zinc fills in the pseudogap that is observed for samples with x\!=\!0, \delta\!>\!\!0.2. As x and \delta are increased, T_{c} drops rapidly, and a superconductor-insulator transition is observed at a sheet resistance of approximately h/(2e)^{2} per copper-oxygen bilayer, for various different combinations of x and \delta.

The effects of oxygen depletion on YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} are well documented.[1] As the material is underdoped by oxygen removal, the resistivity (\rho) develops significant downward curvature below a temperature T* which is dependent on the doping level. The values of T* correspond closely to those obtained by other measurements[2, 3, 4, 5] which are thought to probe the opening of a pseudogap in the spin excitation spectrum. Since it is unlikely that the number of carriers increases below T*, it appears that this "spin gap" reduces the in-plane scattering rate. Extension of this type of study to Zn-doped cuprate superconductors is of interest because Zn substitutes for the in-plane copper atoms, leading to an enhancement of the in-plane scattering rate and a rapid drop of T_{c}[6, 7, 8, 9] So far, most transport studies of the effects of Zn doping have concentrated on fully oxygenated material, in which T_{c} is reduced by approximately 10 K per at. % of Zn. Recently, there have been several reports based on measurements of the specific heat,[10] inelastic neutron scattering,[11] NMR,[12] ESR,[4] and the thermoelectric power[13] that the substitution of Zn into oxygen depleted YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} restores some of the low-energy excitations, and so fills in the spin gap.

In this paper we summarize a study of the transport properties of YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin films with 0<x<0.07 and 0.05<\delta\!<0.67. Matthiessen's rule is followed quite well as a function of x in the fully oxygenated material, and for 0<x<0.03 and 0.23<\delta\!<0.32, there is evidence that Zn substitution fills the spin gap. As x and \delta are increased above these values, there is a superconductor to insulator transition at a sheet resistance of approximately h/(2e)^{2} per CuO_{2} bilayer.

The films were grown on SrTiO_{3} substrates by laser ablation from sintered targets of YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{7-\delta}, using deposition conditions and deoxygenation procedures outlined in Refs. [1] and [14]. They were patterned photolithographically into Hall bars with two pairs of contacts for measuring either the resistivity or Hall effect. Film stoichiometry was determined by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Low accelerating voltages (<6.5 KeV) were used to ensure that the electrons were confined to the films.[15] All elements were studied, using single-crystal YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} and pure Zn as calibration standards, and the Cu L\,\alpha and Zn L\,\alpha x-ray lines were resolved by using wavelength dispersive x-ray spectrometers.

Film thickness determination is important for a study of this kind, and we also used the electron probe for this. The accelerating voltage was raised until there was significant penetration to the substrate, and the thickness was calculated from the relative emission intensity of the Y L\,\alpha and Sr L\,\alpha x-ray lines from the film and substrate, respectively. We estimate the absolute thickness error as 10-15 %, but the precision for film to film changes is better than 1%. This precision is considerably better than we could achieve using profilometry. The transport measurements were made using standard ac methods.

 the s channel gives a sheet resistance of 143 \Omega/at. % Zn for a large Fermi surface (k_{F}\sim 0.7 A^{-1} or a hole concentration, n\sim 1.15/Cu) and 1100 \Omega/at. % Zn for a small one (k_{F}\sim 0.25 A^{-1} or n\sim 0.15/Cu). In 2D, \pi/2 phase shifts in higher-order channels (e.g. p_{z}, f, etc.) give sheet resistances which are a factor of 2 larger.[7] Thus for \delta= 0.05 the residual resistivity observed experimentally corresponds approximately to that expected for a large Fermi surface and strong scattering (near the unitarity limit) in the d channel. In contrast, for a small Fermi surface the scattering would be well below the unitarity limit.

For higher-\delta values the residual resistivity values are much larger (e.g., \sim 80 \mu\Omega cm/at. % Zn for \delta= 0.3). This will be discussed in a more detailed paper, as will Hall data for the same samples. For \delta= 0.05 the behavior of the inverse Hall angle (cot\Theta_{H}) is in close agreement with Ref. [8], but the temperature dependence of R_{H} is somewhat different. In our work R_{H} is essentially independent of x (for 0<x< 0.03) above 200 K.

The results of a series of deoxygenations of films with x= 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 are shown in Fig. 2. Deoxygenation of pure YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} leads to a depression of T_{c} with very little increase in \rho_{\rm res},[1] but the addition of Zn leads to qualitatively different behavior. As x is increased, T_{c} drops rapidly as a function of \delta, and for T_{c} below 50 K \rho_{\rm res} rises rapidly. Also, the anomalous curvature in the resistivity of the high-\delta samples which has been associated with the opening of the spin gap is suppressed as x is increased. For x= 0 (Ref. [1]) and 0.01 [Fig. 2(a)] d\rho/dT increases with \delta even at high temperatures, where \rho is linear in T, so Matthiessen's rule is not obeyed. Surprisingly, there is a greater tendency to follow Matthiessen's rule with increasing \delta in the x= 0.03 [Fig. 2(c)] and 0.07 [Fig. 4(c)] samples.

The effects of Zn doping on the "pseudogap" feature in \rho at intermediate \delta are more clearly seen in Fig. 3(a), in which \rho is shown as a function of x at \delta= 0.23. Clearly, Matthiessen's rule is not obeyed in this underdoped sample, in contrast to the optimally doped case (\delta= 0.05, Fig. 1 and Refs. [7] and [8]). In common with previous studies on samples with x= 0,[1] we associate a drop in \rho below the extrapolation of its high-temperature linear T dependence with a reduction in scattering due to the opening of the pseudogap. The temperature T^{*} at which the pseudogap opens is defined as the highest temperature at which the deviation from linearity occurs, and is seen to be essentially independent of x, in agreement with Refs. [4] and [10]-[13]. For temperatures below T^{*}, however, the deviation from the linear extrapolation decreases as x increases, suggesting that the additional conductivity contribution from the opening of the pseudogap also decreases with increasing x. This is shown more explicitly in Fig. 3(b), in which \rho res has been subtracted, and the data have been divided by \alpha T, where \alpha is the slope of the linear region.

The rise of \rho_{\rm res} with \delta in Fig. 2 and the apparent localization in the x= 0.03 sample in Fig. 3(a) could, in principle, be due to changes in the quality of the grain boundaries as the deoxygenation is performed. Any changes that occur are certainly reversible, as the films could be cycled to and from optimum doping without a significant change in the resistivity. The data shown in Fig. 4 give further evidence that the rise in \rho_{\rm res} is intrinsic. If oxygen depletion is continued until superconductivity is destroyed, all the films make a superconductor to insulator transition at approximately the same resistivity. This low-temperature behavior has been carefully studied in ultrathin Bi films,[18] in which it occurs as a sheet resistance of approximately h/(2e)^{2}. This observation has been accounted for in terms of pair localization in all two-dimensional superconductors.[19] We see the transition at a value which is independent of the combination of x and \delta that is used, giving confidence that we are observing a universal phenomenon, but the sheet resistance is close to h/(2e)^{2} per formula unit, or per CuO_{2}_bilayer_. A similar observation was made by Mandrus _et al._,[20] who studied Bi_{2}Sr_{2}(Ca_{1-x}Y_{x})Cu_{2}O_{8} single crystals, which also have two CuO_{2} planes per formula unit. In single-layer materials such as Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CuO_{6} (Ref. [21]) or La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4},[22] the value appears to be close to h/(2e)^{2} per CuO_{2} plane.

The coupling between the constituent planes of the bilayers in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} is difficult to estimate experimentally, as most measures of the anisotropy are sensitive to the larger separation between the bilayers. So it is unclear whether the observation of the transition at h/(2e)^{2} per bilayer is simply due to a much stronger coupling between the constituent

  planes, or whether it is connected with a fundamental property of pairing in the bilayer cuprates.

Another question concerns the mechanism of the localization. Weak localization has been identified in Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CuO_{6} by Jing _et al._ on the basis of negative transverse magnetoresistance (MR) in the localization regime.[23] We observe only a positive transverse MR in fields up to 7 T for a fully localized x\!=\!0.03, \delta\!=\!0.56 sample down to temperatures as low as 3.5 K, even though \rho increases as -\lnT below 12 K, so our data are not really consistent with weak localization. In Ref. [23] weak localization occurs for a nonsuperconducting sample whose sheet resistance is less than 1.5 k\Omega per CuO_{2} layer, so the mechanism may well be different from that responsible for the localization here and in Refs. [20]-[22], where the sheet resistance is much higher.

In conclusion, we have studied the resistivity of YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{7-\delta} over a wide range of x and \delta, and have shown that Matthiessen's rule is obeyed well at \delta\!\sim\!0, but is violated at other values of \delta. There is also evidence that Zn substitution fills in the pseudogap that occurs in underdoped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. As T_{c} is lowered by a combination of Zn doping and oxygen depletion, superconductivity is destroyed at a universal value of the sheet resistance for various combinations of x and \delta, but this corresponds to h/(2e)^{2} per CuO_{2} bilayer, for reasons which are not yet entirely understood.
