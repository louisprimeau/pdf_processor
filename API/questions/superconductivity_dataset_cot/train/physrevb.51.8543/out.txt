###### Abstract

Polycrystalline samples of Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} (0 \leq x \leq 1) with tetragonal perovskite-like structure were synthesized and investigated by powder x-ray-diffraction, electrical-resistivity, magnetic-susceptibility, and specific-heat measurements. It is found that the _T_{c}_ decreases monotonically with Pr concentration x from _T_{c}_ \sim 33 K for x = 0 to _T_{c}_ \sim 12 K for x = 0.7. The critical concentration _x_{cr}_ required to suppress the _T_{c}_ to zero is estimated to be around 0.85. Even though the PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} exhibits a semiconducting behavior, the normal-state resistivity at T \geq 100 K remains nearly the same order of magnitude as that of superconducting YSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta}. An effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff}\sim 3\mu_{B} is obtained from the simple Curie-Weiss law and a huge linear term coefficient of specific heat g \sim 440 mJ/mol K^{2} is determined for PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta}. No magnetic transition is observed for PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} down to 0.6 K. However, a superconducting transition with _T_{c}_ \sim 17 K is seen by partially substituting Ca for Pr in Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta}. The similarities and differences in superconductivity and magnetism between Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} and Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} are compared and discussed.

## I Introduction

It is widely known that all but three rare-earth ions, Ce, Pm, and Tb, can substitute Y forming an R Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (1237) structure with _T_{c}_ near 90 K (Ref. [1]) except for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, which is a semiconductor.[2] Meanwhile, an antiferromagnetic order in PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} was observed below _T_{N}_ = 17 K by magnetic-susceptibility and heat-capacity measurements.[3, 4] This magnetic-ordering temperature 17 K of PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than expected if one scales the _T_{N}_ for GdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (_T_{N}_ = 2.2 K) assuming either purely dipolar interactions or Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange. The absence of superconductivity and the unusual magnetic order for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} have been a puzzle since this compound was first synthesized. In order to shed light on the basic mechanisms of oxide high-_T_{c}_ superconductivity, therefore, the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} system has become one of the most studied subpoices in the field of high-_T_{c}_ superconductivity. Plenty of experiments and interpretations focused on the depression of _T_{c}_ with increasing x in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} and the magnetic coupling interactions for high _T_{N}_ in PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} have been conducted and proposed.[5, 6, 7] Nevertheless, to date there are still many unsolved questions to be further clarified.

On the other hand, despite the chemical similarity between Sr and Ba, however, the tetragonal Sr-based 1237 structure can be stabilized only by substituting Mo-O, Fe-O, or Ga-O partially or completely for the Cu-O chain.[8] This is because the shortening of the Sr-O bond will ensure a greater tolerance to the length of other planar Sr-O bonds, and thus will enhance the lattice match among constituent elements and the affinity of the deplacement O(1) atoms to their surroundings.[9] Recently, single-phase _R_Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} has been successfully synthesized, in which R represents all rare-earth elements except Ce and Lu.[10] These compounds were reported to have a _T_{c}_ centering around 30 K, except for La, Pr, and Nd which are not superconducting.[9] Thus, this provides another chance to examine the effect of Pr on _T_{c}_ and the unusual magnetic ordering in the YPr-1237 system. In this paper, we present structural, electrical, magnetic, and specific-heat results for Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta}, and compare with those for Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}.

## II Experimental Methods

All polycrystalline samples Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} (0 \leq x \leq 1) and Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} (0 \leq x \leq 0.15) were prepared by the solid-state-reaction method under identical conditions. High-purity powders of Y_{2}O_{3}, Pr_{6}O_{11}, SrCO_{3}, CaCO_{3}, CuO, and MoO_{3} were mixed in appropriate proportions. The mixed powder was compacted and fired for 3 h at 1020 degC in an oxygen atmosphere. It was then slowly cooled to room temperature at flowing oxygen. The above process was repeated twice. The oxygen content is considered to be in the range 6.9-7.0 using this heat treatment for samples.[9] The structural analysis was  carried out by powder x-ray diffraction using Cu _K_a radiation. Lattice parameters were calculated from the diffraction peak positions by the method of least squares. Electrical resistivity _r_(_T_) measurements were performed on rectangular specimens cut from sintered pellets employing the standard four-probe method with silver paint contacts attached to electrical leads. The magnetic susceptibility was measured using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design) over the temperature range 5-300 K at a field of 5 kOe. The specific heat of pieces (~2 mg) cut from the samples was measured in the range 0.6-40 K with a 3He relaxation calorimeter using the heat pulse technique.11 The samples were attached to a sapphire chip, which has two separated silicon films deposited on it to serve as the heater and the thermometer. The Si-film thermometer was calibrated against a calibrated germanium thermometer. For each point of the specific-heat measurements, a small heat power was introduced to the chip and the thermal relaxation was measured and analyzed to obtain the specific heat of the samples.

## III Results and Discussion

X-ray-diffraction patterns (not shown) reveal that all samples Y1-_x_Pr_x_Sr_2Cu_2,_Mo_0,_3O7-_b_ (0 <= x <= 1) display a tetragonal symmetry, instead of the orthorhombic structure of Ba-based 1237. This suggests that Mo is doped into Cu(1) sites. Calculated results listed in Table I and plotted in Fig. 1 show that lattice parameters increase linearly with the Pr concentration. This indicates that the Pr substitutes for Y readily. Temperature dependence of normalized resistivity for Y1-_x_Pr_x_Sr_2Cu_2,_Mo_0,3O7-_b_ with various x is shown in Fig. 2. At x = 0, the _r_-_T_ curve and _T_c (midpoint) ~33 K are consistent with those reported previously.9 For low x (_x_ <= 0.2), the resistivity shows a metalliclike behavior; however, it begins to develop a broad maximum just above _T_c for x >= 0.3. The upturn of resistivity observed at higher x (_x_ >= 0.3) in this system is similar to that observed in Y1-_x_Pr_x_Ba_2Cu_3O_7-_b_. It is found that the _T_c decreases monotonically with Pr concentration x from _T_c ~33 K for x = 0 to _T_c ~12 K for x = 0.7. The critical concentration _x_cr required to suppress the _T_c to zero is estimated to be around 0.85. These digital values of _T_c versus x are also listed in Table I. The Abrikosov and Gor'kov12 (AG) pair-breaking theory predicts that the reduced transition temperature _T_c(_x_)/_T_c(0) is a universal function of reduced concentration _x_/_x_cr:

\[\ln[\, T_{c}(x)/T_{c}(0)\,] = \psi(1.2) - \psi[\,{\frac{1}{2}} + 0.14\, x T_{c}(0)/x_{\rm cr}T_{c}(x)\,]\,\,,\]

where _ps_ is the digamma function. Curve (1) of Fig. 3 shows the AG fit of _T_c(_x_)/_T_c(0) versus x for Y1-_x_Pr_x_Sr_2Cu_2,_3M0,3O7-_b_ using _x_cr = 0.85. Obviously, curve (1) is far below the data points. A plausible conclusion for the failure of curve (1) to fit the data is that the AG pair-breaking theory simply does not agree with the data. It is noted that the disagreement can be improved just by assuming _T_c(0)~1.2_T_c(0) as seen in curve (2). The physical meaning of _T_c'(0) here is similar to that of _T_c0(0), the maximum obtainable value of _T_c(0) described in Ref. 13 or that of _T_c'(0), the linearly extrapolated _T_c(_x_) as x ~0 described in Ref. 14. This suggests that our sample YSr2Cu2,?Mo0,3O7-_b_ may be in the over-hole-doping state as same as YBa2Cu2O7-_b_. This also reveals complicated mechanisms on the depression of _T_c at the low Pr doping level x <= 0.2. On the other hand, the AG pair-breaking theory does not predict that a metal-insulator (MI) transition will accompany the suppression of superconductivity with the introduction of magnetic impurities. The fact that a MI transition is observed in this and other 1237 systems indicates a reduction in the mobile le carrier density with Pr substitution. Therefore, a mechanism other than AG theory on the suppression of _T_c in Y1-_x_Pr_x_Sr_2Cu_2,_?Mo0,3O7-_b_ should be considered and taken into account. For comparison, the _T_c versus x (curve 3) for Y1-_x_Pr_x_Ba_2Cu_3O_7-_b_ (reproduced from Fig. 55 of Ref. 5) is also included in Fig. 3. It is clear that the suppression  of T_{c} with x is much weaker in the former than that in the latter. Figure 4 shows the normal-state resistivity at 100 K (\rho_{100\;\rm K}) as a function of x for Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta}. The \rho_{100\;\rm K} keeps nearly the same order of magnitude through the whole range of x. In addition, the value of \rho_{100\;\rm K} for PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} is about 4 orders of magnitude smaller than that for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}.[15, 16] From these results, it is clear that Pr substitution has less effect on both T_{c} and resistivity in the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} system than in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. This correlation of T_{c} and resistivity is consistent with the hole-filling-localization model.

The normal paramagnetic behavior of magnetic susceptibility and the inverse magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature for PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} is shown in Fig. 5. A best fit to Curie-Weiss law

  \chi = \chi_{0} + C/(T \sim \Theta ) in the range 20 <= T <= 300 K yields the sum of temperature-independent terms \chi_{0} = 2.03 \times 10^{-5} emu/g, the paramagnetic Curie-Weiss temperature \Theta = - 11 K, and the effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff} = 3.05\mu_{B}. The derived value of \mu_{\rm eff} is close to that for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta} and falls between the free-ion values expected for Pr^{4 + }(3.58\mu_{B}) and Pr^{4 + }(2.54\mu_{B}). However, it is well known that Curie-Weiss moments can be reduced from expected free-ion values by the presence of crystal-field effects. Soderholm and Goodman [17] also argued that this type of analysis for the determination of a valence state is too simple for these complicated materials. Besides, Soderholm _et al._[18] and Hilscher _et al._[19] have shown that the experimental magnetic-susceptibility [18, 19] and specific-heat [19] data for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta} can be interpreted consistently in terms of standard crystal-field (CF) theory of Pr^{3 + } based on the CF parameters extracted from the neutron-diffraction data [20]. The low-temperature magnetic susceptibility of PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} shown in the inset of Fig. 5 shows no indication of magnetic anomaly down to 5 K in contrast to a slope change observed at 17 K in magnetic susceptibility of PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta}[3, 21]. In our previous studies [21, 22], the antiferromagnetic transition temperature T_{N} in PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta} is depressed as the transition metal and Ca substitute partially for Cu(1) and Ba, respectively, such as in the PrBa_{2}(Cu_{1 - x}Ga_{x})_{3}O_{7 - \delta} and Pr(Ba_{1 - x}Ca_{x})_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta} systems. Thus no observation of magnetic ordering transition for PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} in this temperature region is expected.

Low-temperature (0.6 <= T <= 40 K) specific heat C and _C_/_T_ for YSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} and PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} are shown in Fig. 6. The superconducting transition at T_{c} \sim 33 K for polycrystalline YSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} cannot be discerned within our calorimeter resolution. No anomaly is observed in PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} indicating no magnetic-ordering transition down to 0.6 K in contrast to a clear anomaly at T_{N} \sim 17 K for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta}[3, 4]. This is consistent with the magnetic susceptibility result as mentioned above. The Pr-related magnetic contributions to specific heat DC in PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} is calculated by

\[\Delta C = C({\rm PrSr}_{2}{\rm Cu}_{2.7}{\rm Mo}_{0.3}{\rm O}_{7 - \delta})\] \[-C({\rm YSr}_{2}{\rm Cu}_{2.7}{\rm Mo}_{0.3}{\rm O}_{7 - \delta})\ ,\]

where the lattice contribution to specific heat for these two compounds is assumed to be identical. Figure 7 shows the \Delta C and the \Delta C/T as functions of temperature for PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} in the range 0.6 <= T <= 20 K. The features of these two curves are quite similar to those observed in Y_{0.4}Pr_{0.6}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta}[4, 23]. Ghamaty _et al._[23] gave a good description for those data with a combination of nuclear Schottky anomaly, linear term, and Kondo anomaly contributions. This suggests that the magnetic coupling strength in PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} is much weaker than that in Y_{1 - x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta} at x = 1 and may be about the same level as that at x = 0.4 - 0.6. This also means that PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} may be just in the ambiguous region for the superconductivity in competition with magnetic order. The analysis for a linear term coefficient of specific heat g in Y_{1 - x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta} has been discussed by many groups [3, 4, 23, 24]. Generally, the low-temperature specific heat C can be combined with magnetic, electronic, and lattice contributions. In the PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} case, the magnetic part may include several terms, such as nuclear Schottky anomaly, linear term, Kondo anomaly, and/or magnetic ordering contributions as described for Y_{0.4}Pr_{0.6}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta}[23]. Nevertheless, to limit and simplify the preliminary analysis, the linear term coefficient or specific heat g was just calculated by the usual procedure of extrapolating  the nearly linear C/T value to T\!=\!0. C/T versus T^{2} for YSr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} and PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} in the range 6\!\leq\!T\!\leq\!14 K is shown in Fig. 8. Huge values of \gamma\!\sim\!120 and 440 mJ/mol K^{2} were obtained for these two compounds, respectively, indicative of a characteristic of heavy-fermion-like behavior. These \gamma values are larger than those from corresponding Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} system [3, 4, 23, 24] but are comparable to those when Cu is replaced by Fe. [4] It has been pointed out that this \gamma value can be substantially reduced by considering magnetic contributions. [24]

Because the \rho_{100\ \rm K} for Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} keeps nearly the same order of magnitude through the whole range of x and the \rho_{100\ \rm K} of PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} is much smaller than that of PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, it suggests that the PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} may be in the vicinity of the borderline of metal-insulator transition. Also, the magnetic coupling strength in PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} is about the same as in Y_{0.},P_{0.},Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} suggesting that the ground state of PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} is close to a competitive region of superconductivity and magnetic order. In order to elucidate these points, the Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} system was synthesized and studied. X-ray-diffraction patterns for Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} (0\!\leq\!x\!\leq\!0.15) is shown in Fig. 9. It is found that the Sr-based-1237 structure basically persists but with visible impurity peaks indicated by arrows. Clearly, the solid-solution limit in Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} is smaller than that in Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, in which x can exceed 0.3. This indicates that the Sr-based 1237 fits better the larger cation in the rare-earth sites than the Ba-based 1237 does. This is consistent with the fact that LaSr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} and LuBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} are stable, but LuSr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} and LaBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} are difficult to synthesize. [10, 25] The resistivity as a function of temperature for Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} with various x is shown in Fig. 10. A superconducting transition is observed as x\!\geq\!0.05 and reach a maximum T_{c} at x\!\sim\!0.1. The resistivity and magnetic shielding effect with an expanded temperature scale for Pr_{0.},Ca_{0.},Sr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} is shown in the inset of Fig. 10. The onset of superconductivity occurs at \sim\!22 K and reaches the zero resistance at 14 K. This demonstrates a bulk nature of superconductivity in the bulk Ca-doped Pr-1237 samples. Norton _et al._[26, 27] have reported superconductivity with T_{c}\!\sim\!40 K in Pr_{0.},Ca_{0.},Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin film but not in the bulk target. In fact, why the superconductivity only seen in the Pr_{0.},Ca_{0.},Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin film but not in the bulk sample is not yet clear. Norton _et al._[26, 27] also concluded that their result is consistent with the view that the hole

  localization, due to hybridization of Pr 4f electronic levels with the O 2p orbitals, contributes substantially to the suppression of superconductivity by Pr in Y1-_x_PrxBa2Cu3O7-_d_ and this suppression can be partially compensated by appropriate hole doping with Ca. It is believed that the similar argument would be applicable to the Pr1-_x_Ca_Sr2Cu2,M00.3O7-_d_ system. The occurrence of superconductivity in the Pr0,_s_Ca0.1_Sr2Cu2,M00.3O7-_d_ bulk sample can be attributed to a much weaker hybridization in PrSr2Cu2.M00.3O7-_d_ than in PrBa2Cu3O7-_d_. It is emphasized that the T_{c} for Pr0.5Ca0.1_Sr2Cu2,M00.3O7-_d_ (_T__c_~17 K) and Pr0.5Ca0.5Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ (_T__c_~40 K) are much higher than that for Pr0.9Y0.1_Sr2Cu2,M00.3O7-_d_ (_T__c_~0 K) and Pr0.5Y_0.5Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ (_T__c_~0 K), respectively. This illustrates that the divalent Ca must do something different from the trivalent Y in the occurrence of superconductivity. Even though the hybridization of Pr 4f electrons with the CuO2 valence band could lead to a magnetic pair-breaking effect,[16, 28] the hole localization or filling mechanism should play a more important role in the suppression of superconductivity in the Pr-doped 1237 systems.

It is interesting to study the correlation among the absence of superconductivity, anomalously high T_{N}, reduced effective magnetic moment _m_eff, and huge linear term coefficient of specific heat g in these Pr-based cuprates. These parameters for four selected Pr-based compounds including PrBa2Cu3O7, Pr2CuO4, PrBa2Cu2NbO9, and PrSr2Cr2.7MoO3O7 are listed in Table II for comparisons. Where the Pr2CuO4 formed _T_'-type structure consists of only the square-planar CuO4 arrangement with no apical oxygen atoms and the PrBa2Cu2NbO8 has a similar structure to PrBa2Cu3O7 but with NbO2 planes replacing the CuO chains. There are several features which can be pointed out from this table.

(1) All four Pr-based compounds before doping are semiconductors even though some of its isostructural compounds are superconducting at high temperatures. In fact, the Pr2CuO4 seems to have very different structural and physical properties from the other three compounds. For example no indication of any magnetic ordering transition, _m_eff ~ 3.51_m_b_ close to 3.58_m_b_ an expected value for a free Pr3+ ion, and a metal-like g value suggest that the ground state of Pr2CuO4 is clearly nonmagnetic.[29] Whereas the anomalous properties for the other three compounds may be attributed to the unique magnetic and electronic characteristic of Pr ions.

(2) Superconductivity is not observed with or without doping if the compound exhibits a high T_{N} (~10 K), such as bulk PrBa2Cu3O7 and PrBa2Cu2NbO8. However, superconductivity can be achieved by an appropriate doping if the compound exhibits low T_{N} (~ 0 K), such as Pr2CuO4 and PrSr2Cu2.7MoO3O7. Thus the magnetic coupling mechanism between Pr-Pr interactions may be a key factor for the suppression of T_{c} in these Pr-based cuprates.

(3) The high T_{N} and a reduced _m_eff accompanied with a small g for PrBa2Cu2NbO8 are interesting. If the reduction of _m_eff for Pr ion were ascribed to a large crystal-field effect (CFE) and the strong magnetic correlations (high T_{N}) of the Pr magnetic moments were caused by an enhanced hybridization of Pr 4f electrons with holes in the CuO2 planes, the large CFE seems to act independently of this strong hybridization in these materials. In other words, the reduction of _m_eff resulted from the large CFE may not be so relevant to the suppression of T_{c}. This is also evidenced by that a superconductivity was observed in Y1-_x_PrxBa2Cu3O7-_d_,[33]Y1-_x_PrxSr2Cu2,M00.3O7-_d_, and Pr1-_x_Ca_Sr2Cu2.7MoO3O7-_d_ systems with a reduced _m_eff even in superconducting samples.

(4) It is difficult to relate the huge g to other parameters from the information listed in Table II. In fact, the origin of the huge g for some Pr-based compounds is not yet clear. The change in g value does not depend on whether samples are superconducting or insulating in Y1-_x_PrxBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (Ref. 24). This suggests that the huge g is not closely responsible for the suppression of T_{c}. In addition, a high T_{N} (~12 K) with a small g in PrBa2Cu2NbO8 and a low T_{N} (~0 K) with a huge g in PrSr2Cu2.7MoO3O7 also suggest that the huge g is not primarily due to the strong coupling between Pr ions.

The observation for the rare-earth ionic-radius effect on the suppression of T_{c} (Refs. 14, 15, and 34) and of T_{N} (Ref. 35) in the R1-_x_PrxBa2Cu3O7-_d_ system strongly suggests that the hybridization of Pr 4f electrons with the holes in the CuO2 planes must play an important role in these anomalous physical properties. Moreover, the hybridization of Pr 4f electrons with holes in Cu-O2 planes has been proposed by Torrance and Metzger[36] as a mechanism that causes a localization of the conducting

  holes in the Cu-O_{2} planes. The enhanced hybridization can yield both the unexpected high magnetic ordering temperature and the suppression of superconductivity.[37]

## IV IV. Conclusion

The suppression of T_{c} in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} has been studied and compared to that in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. The x dependence of T_{c} cannot be simply described by the AG pair-breaking model, though the disagreement can be improved with the use of the optimal T_{c}(0). The large value of x_{\rm cr} and the low normal-state resistivity indicate that the localization of the conduction holes induced by Pr substitution is rather weaker in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} than in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. This correlation of T_{c} and resistivity is consistent with the hole-filling-localization model. The observations of a reduced \mu_{\rm eff} and a huge \gamma are similar in both systems. In contrast to a T_{N} \sim 17 K seen in PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, no indication of any magnetic ordering transition down to 0.6 K is observed in PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta}. In addition, a superconducting transition with T_{c} \sim 17 K is observed resistively and inductively in Pr_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta}. Basically these results are discussed and explained within a framework that a strong magnetic correlation (high T_{N}) of the Pr magnetic moments is caused or mediated by an enhanced hybridization of Pr 4f electrons with holes in the CuO_{2} planes. As a consequence, this is thought to be the primary origin for the suppression of T_{c} in these Pr-based cuprates.

###### Abstract

Polycrystalline samples of Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} (0 \leq x \leq 1) with tetragonal perovskite-like structure were synthesized and investigated by powder x-ray-diffraction, electrical-resistivity, magnetic-susceptibility, and specific-heat measurements. It is found that the _T_{c}_ decreases monotonically with Pr concentration x from _T_{c}_ \sim 33 K for x = 0 to _T_{c}_ \sim 12 K for x = 0.7. The critical concentration _x_{cr}_ required to suppress the _T_{c}_ to zero is estimated to be around 0.85. Even though the PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} exhibits a semiconducting behavior, the normal-state resistivity at T \geq 100 K remains nearly the same order of magnitude as that of superconducting YSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta}. An effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff}\sim 3\mu_{B} is obtained from the simple Curie-Weiss law and a huge linear term coefficient of specific heat g \sim 440 mJ/mol K^{2} is determined for PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta}. No magnetic transition is observed for PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} down to 0.6 K. However, a superconducting transition with _T_{c}_ \sim 17 K is seen by partially substituting Ca for Pr in Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta}. The similarities and differences in superconductivity and magnetism between Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} and Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} are compared and discussed.

## I Introduction

It is widely known that all but three rare-earth ions, Ce, Pm, and Tb, can substitute Y forming an R Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (1237) structure with _T_{c}_ near 90 K (Ref. [1]) except for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, which is a semiconductor.[2] Meanwhile, an antiferromagnetic order in PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} was observed below _T_{N}_ = 17 K by magnetic-susceptibility and heat-capacity measurements.[3, 4] This magnetic-ordering temperature 17 K of PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than expected if one scales the _T_{N}_ for GdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (_T_{N}_ = 2.2 K) assuming either purely dipolar interactions or Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange. The absence of superconductivity and the unusual magnetic order for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} have been a puzzle since this compound was first synthesized. In order to shed light on the basic mechanisms of oxide high-_T_{c}_ superconductivity, therefore, the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} system has become one of the most studied subpoices in the field of high-_T_{c}_ superconductivity. Plenty of experiments and interpretations focused on the depression of _T_{c}_ with increasing x in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} and the magnetic coupling interactions for high _T_{N}_ in PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} have been conducted and proposed.[5, 6, 7] Nevertheless, to date there are still many unsolved questions to be further clarified.

On the other hand, despite the chemical similarity between Sr and Ba, however, the tetragonal Sr-based 1237 structure can be stabilized only by substituting Mo-O, Fe-O, or Ga-O partially or completely for the Cu-O chain.[8] This is because the shortening of the Sr-O bond will ensure a greater tolerance to the length of other planar Sr-O bonds, and thus will enhance the lattice match among constituent elements and the affinity of the deplacement O(1) atoms to their surroundings.[9] Recently, single-phase _R_Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} has been successfully synthesized, in which R represents all rare-earth elements except Ce and Lu.[10] These compounds were reported to have a _T_{c}_ centering around 30 K, except for La, Pr, and Nd which are not superconducting.[9] Thus, this provides another chance to examine the effect of Pr on _T_{c}_ and the unusual magnetic ordering in the YPr-1237 system. In this paper, we present structural, electrical, magnetic, and specific-heat results for Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta}, and compare with those for Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}.

## II Experimental Methods

All polycrystalline samples Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} (0 \leq x \leq 1) and Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} (0 \leq x \leq 0.15) were prepared by the solid-state-reaction method under identical conditions. High-purity powders of Y_{2}O_{3}, Pr_{6}O_{11}, SrCO_{3}, CaCO_{3}, CuO, and MoO_{3} were mixed in appropriate proportions. The mixed powder was compacted and fired for 3 h at 1020 degC in an oxygen atmosphere. It was then slowly cooled to room temperature at flowing oxygen. The above process was repeated twice. The oxygen content is considered to be in the range 6.9-7.0 using this heat treatment for samples.[9] The structural analysis was  carried out by powder x-ray diffraction using Cu _K_a radiation. Lattice parameters were calculated from the diffraction peak positions by the method of least squares. Electrical resistivity _r_(_T_) measurements were performed on rectangular specimens cut from sintered pellets employing the standard four-probe method with silver paint contacts attached to electrical leads. The magnetic susceptibility was measured using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design) over the temperature range 5-300 K at a field of 5 kOe. The specific heat of pieces (~2 mg) cut from the samples was measured in the range 0.6-40 K with a 3He relaxation calorimeter using the heat pulse technique.11 The samples were attached to a sapphire chip, which has two separated silicon films deposited on it to serve as the heater and the thermometer. The Si-film thermometer was calibrated against a calibrated germanium thermometer. For each point of the specific-heat measurements, a small heat power was introduced to the chip and the thermal relaxation was measured and analyzed to obtain the specific heat of the samples.

## III Results and Discussion

X-ray-diffraction patterns (not shown) reveal that all samples Y1-_x_Pr_x_Sr_2Cu_2,_Mo_0,_3O7-_b_ (0 <= x <= 1) display a tetragonal symmetry, instead of the orthorhombic structure of Ba-based 1237. This suggests that Mo is doped into Cu(1) sites. Calculated results listed in Table I and plotted in Fig. 1 show that lattice parameters increase linearly with the Pr concentration. This indicates that the Pr substitutes for Y readily. Temperature dependence of normalized resistivity for Y1-_x_Pr_x_Sr_2Cu_2,_Mo_0,3O7-_b_ with various x is shown in Fig. 2. At x = 0, the _r_-_T_ curve and _T_c (midpoint) ~33 K are consistent with those reported previously.9 For low x (_x_ <= 0.2), the resistivity shows a metalliclike behavior; however, it begins to develop a broad maximum just above _T_c for x >= 0.3. The upturn of resistivity observed at higher x (_x_ >= 0.3) in this system is similar to that observed in Y1-_x_Pr_x_Ba_2Cu_3O_7-_b_. It is found that the _T_c decreases monotonically with Pr concentration x from _T_c ~33 K for x = 0 to _T_c ~12 K for x = 0.7. The critical concentration _x_cr required to suppress the _T_c to zero is estimated to be around 0.85. These digital values of _T_c versus x are also listed in Table I. The Abrikosov and Gor'kov12 (AG) pair-breaking theory predicts that the reduced transition temperature _T_c(_x_)/_T_c(0) is a universal function of reduced concentration _x_/_x_cr:

\[\ln[\, T_{c}(x)/T_{c}(0)\,] = \psi(1.2) - \psi[\,{\frac{1}{2}} + 0.14\, x T_{c}(0)/x_{\rm cr}T_{c}(x)\,]\,\,,\]

where _ps_ is the digamma function. Curve (1) of Fig. 3 shows the AG fit of _T_c(_x_)/_T_c(0) versus x for Y1-_x_Pr_x_Sr_2Cu_2,_3M0,3O7-_b_ using _x_cr = 0.85. Obviously, curve (1) is far below the data points. A plausible conclusion for the failure of curve (1) to fit the data is that the AG pair-breaking theory simply does not agree with the data. It is noted that the disagreement can be improved just by assuming _T_c(0)~1.2_T_c(0) as seen in curve (2). The physical meaning of _T_c'(0) here is similar to that of _T_c0(0), the maximum obtainable value of _T_c(0) described in Ref. 13 or that of _T_c'(0), the linearly extrapolated _T_c(_x_) as x ~0 described in Ref. 14. This suggests that our sample YSr2Cu2,?Mo0,3O7-_b_ may be in the over-hole-doping state as same as YBa2Cu2O7-_b_. This also reveals complicated mechanisms on the depression of _T_c at the low Pr doping level x <= 0.2. On the other hand, the AG pair-breaking theory does not predict that a metal-insulator (MI) transition will accompany the suppression of superconductivity with the introduction of magnetic impurities. The fact that a MI transition is observed in this and other 1237 systems indicates a reduction in the mobile le carrier density with Pr substitution. Therefore, a mechanism other than AG theory on the suppression of _T_c in Y1-_x_Pr_x_Sr_2Cu_2,_?Mo0,3O7-_b_ should be considered and taken into account. For comparison, the _T_c versus x (curve 3) for Y1-_x_Pr_x_Ba_2Cu_3O_7-_b_ (reproduced from Fig. 55 of Ref. 5) is also included in Fig. 3. It is clear that the suppression  of T_{c} with x is much weaker in the former than that in the latter. Figure 4 shows the normal-state resistivity at 100 K (\rho_{100\;\rm K}) as a function of x for Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta}. The \rho_{100\;\rm K} keeps nearly the same order of magnitude through the whole range of x. In addition, the value of \rho_{100\;\rm K} for PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} is about 4 orders of magnitude smaller than that for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}.[15, 16] From these results, it is clear that Pr substitution has less effect on both T_{c} and resistivity in the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} system than in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. This correlation of T_{c} and resistivity is consistent with the hole-filling-localization model.

The normal paramagnetic behavior of magnetic susceptibility and the inverse magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature for PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} is shown in Fig. 5. A best fit to Curie-Weiss law

  \chi = \chi_{0} + C/(T \sim \Theta ) in the range 20 <= T <= 300 K yields the sum of temperature-independent terms \chi_{0} = 2.03 \times 10^{-5} emu/g, the paramagnetic Curie-Weiss temperature \Theta = - 11 K, and the effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff} = 3.05\mu_{B}. The derived value of \mu_{\rm eff} is close to that for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta} and falls between the free-ion values expected for Pr^{4 + }(3.58\mu_{B}) and Pr^{4 + }(2.54\mu_{B}). However, it is well known that Curie-Weiss moments can be reduced from expected free-ion values by the presence of crystal-field effects. Soderholm and Goodman [17] also argued that this type of analysis for the determination of a valence state is too simple for these complicated materials. Besides, Soderholm _et al._[18] and Hilscher _et al._[19] have shown that the experimental magnetic-susceptibility [18, 19] and specific-heat [19] data for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta} can be interpreted consistently in terms of standard crystal-field (CF) theory of Pr^{3 + } based on the CF parameters extracted from the neutron-diffraction data [20]. The low-temperature magnetic susceptibility of PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} shown in the inset of Fig. 5 shows no indication of magnetic anomaly down to 5 K in contrast to a slope change observed at 17 K in magnetic susceptibility of PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta}[3, 21]. In our previous studies [21, 22], the antiferromagnetic transition temperature T_{N} in PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta} is depressed as the transition metal and Ca substitute partially for Cu(1) and Ba, respectively, such as in the PrBa_{2}(Cu_{1 - x}Ga_{x})_{3}O_{7 - \delta} and Pr(Ba_{1 - x}Ca_{x})_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta} systems. Thus no observation of magnetic ordering transition for PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} in this temperature region is expected.

Low-temperature (0.6 <= T <= 40 K) specific heat C and _C_/_T_ for YSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} and PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} are shown in Fig. 6. The superconducting transition at T_{c} \sim 33 K for polycrystalline YSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} cannot be discerned within our calorimeter resolution. No anomaly is observed in PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} indicating no magnetic-ordering transition down to 0.6 K in contrast to a clear anomaly at T_{N} \sim 17 K for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta}[3, 4]. This is consistent with the magnetic susceptibility result as mentioned above. The Pr-related magnetic contributions to specific heat DC in PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} is calculated by

\[\Delta C = C({\rm PrSr}_{2}{\rm Cu}_{2.7}{\rm Mo}_{0.3}{\rm O}_{7 - \delta})\] \[-C({\rm YSr}_{2}{\rm Cu}_{2.7}{\rm Mo}_{0.3}{\rm O}_{7 - \delta})\ ,\]

where the lattice contribution to specific heat for these two compounds is assumed to be identical. Figure 7 shows the \Delta C and the \Delta C/T as functions of temperature for PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} in the range 0.6 <= T <= 20 K. The features of these two curves are quite similar to those observed in Y_{0.4}Pr_{0.6}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta}[4, 23]. Ghamaty _et al._[23] gave a good description for those data with a combination of nuclear Schottky anomaly, linear term, and Kondo anomaly contributions. This suggests that the magnetic coupling strength in PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} is much weaker than that in Y_{1 - x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta} at x = 1 and may be about the same level as that at x = 0.4 - 0.6. This also means that PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} may be just in the ambiguous region for the superconductivity in competition with magnetic order. The analysis for a linear term coefficient of specific heat g in Y_{1 - x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta} has been discussed by many groups [3, 4, 23, 24]. Generally, the low-temperature specific heat C can be combined with magnetic, electronic, and lattice contributions. In the PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7 - \delta} case, the magnetic part may include several terms, such as nuclear Schottky anomaly, linear term, Kondo anomaly, and/or magnetic ordering contributions as described for Y_{0.4}Pr_{0.6}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \delta}[23]. Nevertheless, to limit and simplify the preliminary analysis, the linear term coefficient or specific heat g was just calculated by the usual procedure of extrapolating  the nearly linear C/T value to T\!=\!0. C/T versus T^{2} for YSr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} and PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} in the range 6\!\leq\!T\!\leq\!14 K is shown in Fig. 8. Huge values of \gamma\!\sim\!120 and 440 mJ/mol K^{2} were obtained for these two compounds, respectively, indicative of a characteristic of heavy-fermion-like behavior. These \gamma values are larger than those from corresponding Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} system [3, 4, 23, 24] but are comparable to those when Cu is replaced by Fe. [4] It has been pointed out that this \gamma value can be substantially reduced by considering magnetic contributions. [24]

Because the \rho_{100\ \rm K} for Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} keeps nearly the same order of magnitude through the whole range of x and the \rho_{100\ \rm K} of PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} is much smaller than that of PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, it suggests that the PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} may be in the vicinity of the borderline of metal-insulator transition. Also, the magnetic coupling strength in PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} is about the same as in Y_{0.},P_{0.},Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} suggesting that the ground state of PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} is close to a competitive region of superconductivity and magnetic order. In order to elucidate these points, the Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} system was synthesized and studied. X-ray-diffraction patterns for Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} (0\!\leq\!x\!\leq\!0.15) is shown in Fig. 9. It is found that the Sr-based-1237 structure basically persists but with visible impurity peaks indicated by arrows. Clearly, the solid-solution limit in Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} is smaller than that in Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, in which x can exceed 0.3. This indicates that the Sr-based 1237 fits better the larger cation in the rare-earth sites than the Ba-based 1237 does. This is consistent with the fact that LaSr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} and LuBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} are stable, but LuSr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} and LaBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} are difficult to synthesize. [10, 25] The resistivity as a function of temperature for Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} with various x is shown in Fig. 10. A superconducting transition is observed as x\!\geq\!0.05 and reach a maximum T_{c} at x\!\sim\!0.1. The resistivity and magnetic shielding effect with an expanded temperature scale for Pr_{0.},Ca_{0.},Sr_{2}Cu_{2.},M0_{0.},O_{7-\delta} is shown in the inset of Fig. 10. The onset of superconductivity occurs at \sim\!22 K and reaches the zero resistance at 14 K. This demonstrates a bulk nature of superconductivity in the bulk Ca-doped Pr-1237 samples. Norton _et al._[26, 27] have reported superconductivity with T_{c}\!\sim\!40 K in Pr_{0.},Ca_{0.},Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin film but not in the bulk target. In fact, why the superconductivity only seen in the Pr_{0.},Ca_{0.},Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin film but not in the bulk sample is not yet clear. Norton _et al._[26, 27] also concluded that their result is consistent with the view that the hole

  localization, due to hybridization of Pr 4f electronic levels with the O 2p orbitals, contributes substantially to the suppression of superconductivity by Pr in Y1-_x_PrxBa2Cu3O7-_d_ and this suppression can be partially compensated by appropriate hole doping with Ca. It is believed that the similar argument would be applicable to the Pr1-_x_Ca_Sr2Cu2,M00.3O7-_d_ system. The occurrence of superconductivity in the Pr0,_s_Ca0.1_Sr2Cu2,M00.3O7-_d_ bulk sample can be attributed to a much weaker hybridization in PrSr2Cu2.M00.3O7-_d_ than in PrBa2Cu3O7-_d_. It is emphasized that the T_{c} for Pr0.5Ca0.1_Sr2Cu2,M00.3O7-_d_ (_T__c_~17 K) and Pr0.5Ca0.5Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ (_T__c_~40 K) are much higher than that for Pr0.9Y0.1_Sr2Cu2,M00.3O7-_d_ (_T__c_~0 K) and Pr0.5Y_0.5Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ (_T__c_~0 K), respectively. This illustrates that the divalent Ca must do something different from the trivalent Y in the occurrence of superconductivity. Even though the hybridization of Pr 4f electrons with the CuO2 valence band could lead to a magnetic pair-breaking effect,[16, 28] the hole localization or filling mechanism should play a more important role in the suppression of superconductivity in the Pr-doped 1237 systems.

It is interesting to study the correlation among the absence of superconductivity, anomalously high T_{N}, reduced effective magnetic moment _m_eff, and huge linear term coefficient of specific heat g in these Pr-based cuprates. These parameters for four selected Pr-based compounds including PrBa2Cu3O7, Pr2CuO4, PrBa2Cu2NbO9, and PrSr2Cr2.7MoO3O7 are listed in Table II for comparisons. Where the Pr2CuO4 formed _T_'-type structure consists of only the square-planar CuO4 arrangement with no apical oxygen atoms and the PrBa2Cu2NbO8 has a similar structure to PrBa2Cu3O7 but with NbO2 planes replacing the CuO chains. There are several features which can be pointed out from this table.

(1) All four Pr-based compounds before doping are semiconductors even though some of its isostructural compounds are superconducting at high temperatures. In fact, the Pr2CuO4 seems to have very different structural and physical properties from the other three compounds. For example no indication of any magnetic ordering transition, _m_eff ~ 3.51_m_b_ close to 3.58_m_b_ an expected value for a free Pr3+ ion, and a metal-like g value suggest that the ground state of Pr2CuO4 is clearly nonmagnetic.[29] Whereas the anomalous properties for the other three compounds may be attributed to the unique magnetic and electronic characteristic of Pr ions.

(2) Superconductivity is not observed with or without doping if the compound exhibits a high T_{N} (~10 K), such as bulk PrBa2Cu3O7 and PrBa2Cu2NbO8. However, superconductivity can be achieved by an appropriate doping if the compound exhibits low T_{N} (~ 0 K), such as Pr2CuO4 and PrSr2Cu2.7MoO3O7. Thus the magnetic coupling mechanism between Pr-Pr interactions may be a key factor for the suppression of T_{c} in these Pr-based cuprates.

(3) The high T_{N} and a reduced _m_eff accompanied with a small g for PrBa2Cu2NbO8 are interesting. If the reduction of _m_eff for Pr ion were ascribed to a large crystal-field effect (CFE) and the strong magnetic correlations (high T_{N}) of the Pr magnetic moments were caused by an enhanced hybridization of Pr 4f electrons with holes in the CuO2 planes, the large CFE seems to act independently of this strong hybridization in these materials. In other words, the reduction of _m_eff resulted from the large CFE may not be so relevant to the suppression of T_{c}. This is also evidenced by that a superconductivity was observed in Y1-_x_PrxBa2Cu3O7-_d_,[33]Y1-_x_PrxSr2Cu2,M00.3O7-_d_, and Pr1-_x_Ca_Sr2Cu2.7MoO3O7-_d_ systems with a reduced _m_eff even in superconducting samples.

(4) It is difficult to relate the huge g to other parameters from the information listed in Table II. In fact, the origin of the huge g for some Pr-based compounds is not yet clear. The change in g value does not depend on whether samples are superconducting or insulating in Y1-_x_PrxBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (Ref. 24). This suggests that the huge g is not closely responsible for the suppression of T_{c}. In addition, a high T_{N} (~12 K) with a small g in PrBa2Cu2NbO8 and a low T_{N} (~0 K) with a huge g in PrSr2Cu2.7MoO3O7 also suggest that the huge g is not primarily due to the strong coupling between Pr ions.

The observation for the rare-earth ionic-radius effect on the suppression of T_{c} (Refs. 14, 15, and 34) and of T_{N} (Ref. 35) in the R1-_x_PrxBa2Cu3O7-_d_ system strongly suggests that the hybridization of Pr 4f electrons with the holes in the CuO2 planes must play an important role in these anomalous physical properties. Moreover, the hybridization of Pr 4f electrons with holes in Cu-O2 planes has been proposed by Torrance and Metzger[36] as a mechanism that causes a localization of the conducting

  holes in the Cu-O_{2} planes. The enhanced hybridization can yield both the unexpected high magnetic ordering temperature and the suppression of superconductivity.[37]

## IV IV. Conclusion

The suppression of T_{c} in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} has been studied and compared to that in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. The x dependence of T_{c} cannot be simply described by the AG pair-breaking model, though the disagreement can be improved with the use of the optimal T_{c}(0). The large value of x_{\rm cr} and the low normal-state resistivity indicate that the localization of the conduction holes induced by Pr substitution is rather weaker in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta} than in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. This correlation of T_{c} and resistivity is consistent with the hole-filling-localization model. The observations of a reduced \mu_{\rm eff} and a huge \gamma are similar in both systems. In contrast to a T_{N} \sim 17 K seen in PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, no indication of any magnetic ordering transition down to 0.6 K is observed in PrSr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta}. In addition, a superconducting transition with T_{c} \sim 17 K is observed resistively and inductively in Pr_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Sr_{2}Cu_{2.7}Mo_{0.3}O_{7-\delta}. Basically these results are discussed and explained within a framework that a strong magnetic correlation (high T_{N}) of the Pr magnetic moments is caused or mediated by an enhanced hybridization of Pr 4f electrons with holes in the CuO_{2} planes. As a consequence, this is thought to be the primary origin for the suppression of T_{c} in these Pr-based cuprates.
