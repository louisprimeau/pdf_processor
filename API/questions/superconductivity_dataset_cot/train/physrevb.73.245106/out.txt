###### Abstract

We report the structural, magnetic, electrical transport, and specific heat properties of polycrystalline GaCNi_{3} sample. The T^{2} temperature dependence of resistivity and the large values of the Kadowaki-woods ratio A/\gamma^{2} (7.2 \mum cm/K^{2}) and the Wilson ratio (9.2) suggest a highly correlated Fermi liquid behavior in GaCNi_{3}. Such a large electron-electron correlation is due to the proximity of ferromagnetic order from the side of exchange-enhanced Pauli paramagnet, accompanied by remarkable enhancements in the electronic specific heat coefficient \gamma and the temperature independent magnetic susceptibility \chi_{0}.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity (the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}=8 K) in antiperovskite compound MgCNi_{3} has drawn lots of attentions owing to the high nickel content which may complicate the origin of superconductivity and being a possible link between the traditional intermetallic superconductors and the high T_{c} oxide ones.[1] It has been theoretically suggested to be an unconventional superconductor and near the instability to the ferromagnetism.[2] Experimentally, the pairing mechanism of MgCNi_{3} is quite controversial. The London penetration depth,[3] critical current behavior,[4] and the earlier tunneling spectra[5] suggested an unconventional pairing state. While the NMR relaxation rate,[6] specific heat data,[7] and the latter tunneling spectra[8] support a conventional s-wave BCS type behavior. Though no long-range magnetic order has been observed, the FM spin fluctuation has been confirmed to be vigorous in both pristine[6, 7] and doped[9] MgCNi_{3}. So far there are many investigations on the doping effects in MgCNi_{3}. Except for Ni-site doping with Fe, which causes an increase in T_{c} followed by a decrease with further doping, other doping experiments at either Ni-site,[9, 10, 11, 12] or Mg-site,[13] or[14] C-site are found to suppress the superconductivity in various ways. In addition, the properties of MgC_{x}Ni_{3} are very sensitive to the carbon concentration x. The superconductivity disappears when x\leq 0.88.[15] The band structure calculation[16] indicates that as x decreases in MgC_{x}Ni_{3}, the proximity to ferromagnetism increases, and the increasing spin fluctuations may be responsible for the reduction of T_{c}. However the specific heat studies suggest that a lowering of x can reduce the strength of both electron-phonon (e-p) coupling and spin fluctuations and the weakening of e-p coupling would lead to a decrease in T_{c}.[17, 18] Anyhow the physics of MgCNi_{3} is far away from being thoroughly understood at present, therefore more efforts are needed.

Alternatively, the study on the closely related compounds is of interest for pursuing new phenomenon, e.g., superconductivity, as well as for understanding the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in MgCNi_{3}. Recently several related nickel-based compounds, i.e., ZnCNi_{3},[19] SeB_{0.5}Ni_{3},[20] and[21] AlCNi_{3} have been synthesized. No superconductivity has been found in either of them. The Zn and Sc based compounds exhibit Pauli paramagnetic (PM) metallic behavior, while a PM into weak FM transition takes place at near 300 K in AlCNi_{3}. In this paper we report the synthesis and physical properties of another antiperovskite compound GaCNi_{3}, A strong electron-electron correlation in this system has been detected through the Kadowaki-Woods ratio and the Wilson ratio. It can be attributable to being on the threshold of ferromagnetism.

## II Experimental details

The initial ingots of Ga (5N) and powders of Graphite (3N) and Ni (4N) with nominal composition GaCNi_{3} were mixed and placed in a molybdenum boat, which was put into a tube furnace and treated at 400^{\circ}C for 5 h under flowing mixed gas of 95% Ar and 5% H_{2}. After furnace cooling, the initial mixture became a loose bulk, which was then ground thoroughly and pressed into pellets. Then the pellets were annealed for 10 h at different temperatures varying from 750^{\circ}C to 850^{\circ}C to 950^{\circ}C, respectively under the same atmosphere mentioned above. In order to improve the sample quality, the latter heat treatments were repeated for two more times. No appreciable changes in weight were observed during the heat treatments. With the help of x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) we found that single antiperovskite phase can only be obtained in 950^{\circ}C sintered pellets. The sample with the size of 1 mm\times3 mm\times5 mm was cut off from a pellet sintered at 950^{\circ}C for the resistivity measurement, after which the sample was cut into two parts. One was cut into a column shape for magnetic measurements and another into a slice of 0.5 mm\times2.5 mm\times2.5 mm for the specific heat measurement. Our reported data is representative of GaCNi_{3} compound annealed at 950^{\circ}C. X-ray powder diffraction pattern was collected using a Philips X' part PRO x-ray diffractometer with Cu K\alpha radiation at room temperature. The magnetic, dc resistivity, and specific heat measurements were carried out with a quantum design physical property measurement system (PPMS) (2 K \leq T\leq 400 K, 0 \leq H\leq 90 kOe).

## III Result and discussion

Figure 1 shows the x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of GaCNi_{3} annealed at 950^{\circ}C. As a result of structural refine ment using the standard Rietveld technique, it has single cubic perovskite phase with the space group _Pm3m_, as is found in MgCNi3.1 The refined lattice parameter a is 0.3604(5) nm, which is 5% lower than that of MgCNi3.1 A distinct feature of its crystal structure is the three dimensional network of CNi6 octahedron with carbon atoms in the interstitial positions, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1.

Footnote 1: The _Pm3m_ is the _  effective mass of quasiparticles. According to the analyses of specific heat data in the following text, the value of m^{*}/m_{0} for GaCNi_{3} is as large as about 3.3 due to the strong correlated electrons, thus the contribution of Landau diamagnetic susceptibility to \chi_{0} is negligible, i.e., \chi_{0}\sim\chi_{P}. The parameter A reflects the shape of the density of state (DOS) at the Fermi energy E_{\rm F}.[22, 23]

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity for GaCNi_{3}. It exhibits a metallic behavior in the whole temperature range measured and no superconductivity was found down to 2 K. As can be seen in the inset of Fig. 4, below 70 K the resistivity is satisfied with the equation

\[\rho(T)-\rho_{0}=AT^{2},\] (2)

which is suggestive of a Fermi liquid behavior in the ground state. The residual resistivity \rho_{0} and parameter A are found to be 158.5(3) \mu\Omega cm and 0.0046(2) \mu\Omega cm/K^{2}, respectively. It is known that the residual resistivity can be written as \rho_{0}\proptom^{*}/n\tau_{0}, where m^{*}, n, and \hbar/\tau_{0} represent the effective mass of carriers, mobile carrier concentration, and scattering rate associated with the random potential.[25] Since the effective mass m^{*} for GaCNi_{3} is largely enhanced, the large residual resistivity seems to be reasonable. The large residual resistivity of GaCNi_{3} is similar to that of polycrystalline SrRhO_{3} (142 \mu\Omega cm), which is a strongly enhanced paramagnet close to a magnetic instability with a Wilson ratio of 8.6.[26]

Figure 5 shows the specific heat for GaCNi_{3} measured between 5 and 50 K using a thermal relaxation technique. As shown in the inset of Fig. 5, the data below 18 K, plotted as C(T)/T vs T^{2}, can be well fitted using the following formula:

\[C(T)/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4},\] (3)

where the linear term is the electronic contribution, \gamma, i.e., the Sommerfeld constant, the second term is the phonon contribution according to the Debye approximation, the last term reflects deviations from the linear dispersion of the acoustic modes in extended temperature range. The fitted values of \gamma, \beta, and \delta are equal to 25.3(9) mJ/mol K^{2}, 0.108(1) mJ/mol K^{4} and 1.3(9) x 10^{-4} mJ/mol K^{6}, respectively. By the formula, \Theta_{D}=\frac{(\frac{\pi\times 1.944\times 10^{6}}{\beta})}{\beta}[13], where n is the number of atoms in a unit cell, the Debye temperature \Theta_{D} is 448 K, close to that of ZnCNi_{3} (421 K), but much larger than that of MgCNi_{3} (255.9 K).[19] Comparing the available values of Debye temperature for Ni-based antiperovskite compounds, we can find that the Debye temperature increases with decreasing the lattice parameter a. Namely, the Debye temperature is 255.9, 421, and 448 K for MgCNi_{3}, ZnCNi_{3}, and GaCNi_{3}, corresponding to the lattice parameter a:0.381, 0.366, and 0.3604 nm, respectively. This behavior may be roughly interpreted as follows: the lattice contract leads to a phonon hardening, correspondingly an increase of Debye temperature.[19] The value of \gamma for GaCNi_{3} is comparable to that of MgCNi_{3}, 30 mJ/mol K^{2},[1] but almost 4 times as large as that of ZnCNi_{3} (6.77 mJ/mol K^{2}).[19] In MgCNi_{3}, the large electronic specific heat coefficient is suggested to mainly result from the strong e-p coupling,[17] which supports a superconducting ground state. As will be shown in the following text, the large electronic specific heat coefficient in GaCNi_{3} can be ascribed to the strong electron-electron (e-e) coupling. As to ZnCNi_{3}, the electronic specific heat coefficient is only 6.77(mJ/mol K^{2}), indicating that both the e-e and e-p couplings are weak, in agreement with the Pauli PM ground state.

The Kadowaki-Woods ratio A/\gamma^{2} and the Wilson ratio R_{W}=\frac{\nu\pi\kappa_{B}}{\nu_{B}}\frac{(\frac{n}{2})}{\gamma} are the well-known measures of electron-electron correlation. Here \mu_{B} and \kappa_{B} stands for the Bohr magnon and the Boltzmann constant, respectively. Using the values for the coefficient of T^{2} in low temperature resistivity, A, the electronic specific heat coefficient (i.e., Sommerfeld constant) \gamma, and the temperature independent magnetic susceptibility \chi_{0}, the Kadowaki-Woods ratio A/\gamma^{2} and the Wilson ratio R_{W} are calculated as 7.2 \mu\Omega cm/K^{2} and 9.2, respectively. The value of A/\gamma^{2} here is on the verge of the universal value of about 10 \mu\Omega cm/K^{2} in the heavy fermion systems,[27] suggesting a strongly correlated Fermi liquid behavior in the ground state of GaCNi_{3}. More markedly, the value of R_{W} is much larger than unity, which is expected in free electron gas, and well exceeds the strong correlation limit of 2 according to the Anderson model.[28] Very large values of R_{W} have usually been found in the nearly FM ma

  terials due to the Stoner enhancement, such as Sr3Ru2O7,[24]Pd,[29] and [30] TiBe2 with the value of 10, 6, and 12, respectively.

In order to comprehend the observed behavior, we will refer to the Stoner band theory for itinerant ferromagnetism. Unfortunately, however, as far as we know, no band structure calculation has been performed for GaCNi3. Now we attempt to evaluate the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level (_E_F), _N_(_E_F) for GaCNi3 as follows: The electronic structures of Ni3Ga and Ni3Al have been extensively explored as the reference systems for the studies of the itinerant ferromagnetism and exchange-enhanced paramagnetism.[31] Both of them have the same space group with that of antiperovskite GaCNi3 and AlCNi3, i.e., _Pm3m_, while no interstitial C atoms in the body-centered positions. The total _N_(_E_F) for AlCNi3, 2.61 states/(eV unit),[32] is reduced by 53% when compared with that of Ni3Al, 5.52 states/(eV unit),[33] due to the hybridization between C-2p and Ni-3d states. Assuming the same ratio is also available for Ga-based compounds because of the resemblance of these two systems, _N_(_E_F) of GaCNi3 is estimated to be 1.6 states/(eV spin unit) with the value of 3.4 states/(eV spin unit) for Ni3Ga.[31] The feature in the electronic structure of ACNi3 (A=Mg, Zn, Al, Ga, _et al._) is that there exists a DOS peak below the Fermi level, _E_F. With increasing the lattice parameter a, regardless of the kind of element A, this peak moves to _E_F from the low energy side.[34] Correspondingly _N_(_E_F) increases. In this scenario, the _N_(_E_F) of GaCNi3 should lie between the values of AlCNi3 and ZnCNi3, since its lattice parameter a is larger than AlCNi3 but less than ZnCNi3. So, for GaCNi3,[35] 2.61 <_N_(_E_F) < 4.049 with the unit of states/(eV unit). The above estimated value locates well in this range.

For free electron system without consideration of the correlation between electrons, the Sommerfeld constant g and Pauli PM susceptibility _kh__p_ can be expected as \gamma^{th} =\frac{2}{3}\pi^{2}\kappa_{B}^{2}N(E_{\rm F}) and \chi_{p}^{th}=2 _m__B_2_N_(_E_F). Using 1.6 states/(eV spin unit) as the _N_(_E_F) of GaCNi3, g_{h} and _kh__p__h_ can be estimated as 7.6 mJ/mol K2 and 1.03 x 10-4 cm/mol, respectively. The comparison of the experimental _kh_0 with the theoretical \chi_{p}^{th} leads to a very large Stoner enhancement factor _S_(_S_ = _kh_0/_kh__p__h_ = [1-_IN_(_E_F)]-1) of 30.2, where I is the exchange integral that reflects the exchange splitting of the energy bands. The product of _IN_(_E_F), 0.97, is very close to the Stoner criterion _IN_(_E_F) > 1 for emergence of long range FM order, implying that GaCNi3 is in the proximity of the FM order from the exchange-enhanced Pauli PM side. On the other hand, the enhancement of the effective mass for quasiparticles, _m_+/_m_0 is 3.3, i.e., the ratio of the observed electronic specific heat coefficient g to that of the expected one \gamma^{th}. This effect is related to either _e-p_ coupling or _e-e_ coupling or both. The _e-p_ coupling constant can be estimated by the McMillan's formula,[19]

\[\lambda_{ph} = \left[ \frac{N(E_{F})/\langle F^{2}\rangle}{M(\omega)^{2}} \right\rbrack,\]

where \langle I^{2}\rangle is the averaged electron-ion matrix element squared, M is an atomic mass, and \langle\omega^{2}\rangle the averaged phonon frequency proportional to Debye temperature \Theta_{D}. For GaCNi3, given that \langle I^{2}\rangle and M are the same as in MgCNi3, l_{h} is evaluated to be 0.24, much less than that of MgCNi3, 0.77.[1] Therefore the _e-e_ correlation is the dominant contribution to the observed enhancement in the Sommerfeld constant g. This result corresponds to the large Stoner enhancement of the temperature independent magnetic susceptibility _kh_0. Moreover, such a strong _e-e_ correlation against a weak _e-p_ correlation, together with the low value of _N_(_E_F), may account for the absence of superconductivity in GaCNi3. Now we turn to the relative large value of Wilson ratio in GaCNi3. In the self-consistent renormalization (SCR) theory for nearly and weakly itinerant magnets, the Sommerfeld constant g is suggested to be proportional to \ln[ 1 - IN(E_{F})\rbrack.[36] The increase in \ln[ 1 - IN(E_{F})\rbrack is very modest compared with S when _IN_(_E_F) is approaching unity. Consequently, the value of _R_V is capable of being larger than 2. Using _IN_(_E_F) =0.97, the ratio (absolute value) of the enhancement in _kh_0 to that in g is about 8.8, which is well consistent with the observed _R_W.

To the best of our knowledge, it is possibly the first time to observe such a strong electron-electron correlation in the so-called antiperovskite compounds. Here we note that the electron-electron scattering in GaCNi3 may be as strong as in the two-layered perovskite Sr3Ru2O7 since they have similar _A_/_g_2 and _R_W values.[24] Along with the superconductor MgCNi3, strongly correlated GaCNi3 and other related compounds, it is reminiscent of the Ruddleden-Popper (R-P) type ruthenates (Sr,Ca)_{n+1}Ru_{n}O_{3n+1}, which have been extensively explored in recent years due to their abundant physical properties. Among them, for instance, Sr2RuO4 is a triplet superconductor (for single crystal,[37]T_{\rm C}=1.4 K) connected tightly with the spin fluctuations, i.e., electronic correlation, which has also been discovered in other neighboring compounds, such as FM SrRuO3,[38] nearly FM CaRuO3,[39] and Sr3Ru2O7.[24] The ruthenate perovskites and related layered compounds seem to share some similarities with the nickel based antiperovskites ACNi3 (A=Mg, Zn, Al, Ga, _et al._). First, the characteristic structural unit of RuO6 octahedron, though distorted for some cases can be viewed as the counterpart of CNi6 octahedron in nickel-based antiperovskites. Second, according to theoretical calculations there exists large hybridization between d and p states in both ruthenate perovskites[40] and ACNi3,[2, 33] which would account for the itinerant electronic character and heavily influence the low temperature properties.[41] Last, the emergence of vigorous FM correlation in both families probably has some correlations with the superconductivity, i.e., coexistence or competition. In this context, it suggests that studies as to the differences and analogies between these two families would be beneficial to reveal the relationships if it exists between antiperovskites and oxide perovskites, as well as to shed a light on the nature of superconductivity in MgCNi3.

## IV Conclusion

In summary, the structural, magnetic, electronic transport, and specific heat properties of antiperovskite GaCNi3 have been investigated. The resistivity exhibits quadratic tempera  ture dependence below 70 K. The large values of the Kadowaki-woods ratio A/\gamma^{2} and the Wilson ratio R_{W} indicate a strong electron-electron correlation, being attributed to the instability to FM order. The similarity between the nickel-based antiperovskites, e.g., GaCNi_{3} and MgCNi_{3} and the R-P type ruthenates, e.g., p-wave superconductor Sr_{2}RuO_{4} and strongly correlated Sr_{3}Ru_{2}O_{7} has also been discussed in brief.

###### Abstract

We report the structural, magnetic, electrical transport, and specific heat properties of polycrystalline GaCNi_{3} sample. The T^{2} temperature dependence of resistivity and the large values of the Kadowaki-woods ratio A/\gamma^{2} (7.2 \mum cm/K^{2}) and the Wilson ratio (9.2) suggest a highly correlated Fermi liquid behavior in GaCNi_{3}. Such a large electron-electron correlation is due to the proximity of ferromagnetic order from the side of exchange-enhanced Pauli paramagnet, accompanied by remarkable enhancements in the electronic specific heat coefficient \gamma and the temperature independent magnetic susceptibility \chi_{0}.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity (the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}=8 K) in antiperovskite compound MgCNi_{3} has drawn lots of attentions owing to the high nickel content which may complicate the origin of superconductivity and being a possible link between the traditional intermetallic superconductors and the high T_{c} oxide ones.[1] It has been theoretically suggested to be an unconventional superconductor and near the instability to the ferromagnetism.[2] Experimentally, the pairing mechanism of MgCNi_{3} is quite controversial. The London penetration depth,[3] critical current behavior,[4] and the earlier tunneling spectra[5] suggested an unconventional pairing state. While the NMR relaxation rate,[6] specific heat data,[7] and the latter tunneling spectra[8] support a conventional s-wave BCS type behavior. Though no long-range magnetic order has been observed, the FM spin fluctuation has been confirmed to be vigorous in both pristine[6, 7] and doped[9] MgCNi_{3}. So far there are many investigations on the doping effects in MgCNi_{3}. Except for Ni-site doping with Fe, which causes an increase in T_{c} followed by a decrease with further doping, other doping experiments at either Ni-site,[9, 10, 11, 12] or Mg-site,[13] or[14] C-site are found to suppress the superconductivity in various ways. In addition, the properties of MgC_{x}Ni_{3} are very sensitive to the carbon concentration x. The superconductivity disappears when x\leq 0.88.[15] The band structure calculation[16] indicates that as x decreases in MgC_{x}Ni_{3}, the proximity to ferromagnetism increases, and the increasing spin fluctuations may be responsible for the reduction of T_{c}. However the specific heat studies suggest that a lowering of x can reduce the strength of both electron-phonon (e-p) coupling and spin fluctuations and the weakening of e-p coupling would lead to a decrease in T_{c}.[17, 18] Anyhow the physics of MgCNi_{3} is far away from being thoroughly understood at present, therefore more efforts are needed.

Alternatively, the study on the closely related compounds is of interest for pursuing new phenomenon, e.g., superconductivity, as well as for understanding the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in MgCNi_{3}. Recently several related nickel-based compounds, i.e., ZnCNi_{3},[19] SeB_{0.5}Ni_{3},[20] and[21] AlCNi_{3} have been synthesized. No superconductivity has been found in either of them. The Zn and Sc based compounds exhibit Pauli paramagnetic (PM) metallic behavior, while a PM into weak FM transition takes place at near 300 K in AlCNi_{3}. In this paper we report the synthesis and physical properties of another antiperovskite compound GaCNi_{3}, A strong electron-electron correlation in this system has been detected through the Kadowaki-Woods ratio and the Wilson ratio. It can be attributable to being on the threshold of ferromagnetism.

## II Experimental details

The initial ingots of Ga (5N) and powders of Graphite (3N) and Ni (4N) with nominal composition GaCNi_{3} were mixed and placed in a molybdenum boat, which was put into a tube furnace and treated at 400^{\circ}C for 5 h under flowing mixed gas of 95% Ar and 5% H_{2}. After furnace cooling, the initial mixture became a loose bulk, which was then ground thoroughly and pressed into pellets. Then the pellets were annealed for 10 h at different temperatures varying from 750^{\circ}C to 850^{\circ}C to 950^{\circ}C, respectively under the same atmosphere mentioned above. In order to improve the sample quality, the latter heat treatments were repeated for two more times. No appreciable changes in weight were observed during the heat treatments. With the help of x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) we found that single antiperovskite phase can only be obtained in 950^{\circ}C sintered pellets. The sample with the size of 1 mm\times3 mm\times5 mm was cut off from a pellet sintered at 950^{\circ}C for the resistivity measurement, after which the sample was cut into two parts. One was cut into a column shape for magnetic measurements and another into a slice of 0.5 mm\times2.5 mm\times2.5 mm for the specific heat measurement. Our reported data is representative of GaCNi_{3} compound annealed at 950^{\circ}C. X-ray powder diffraction pattern was collected using a Philips X' part PRO x-ray diffractometer with Cu K\alpha radiation at room temperature. The magnetic, dc resistivity, and specific heat measurements were carried out with a quantum design physical property measurement system (PPMS) (2 K \leq T\leq 400 K, 0 \leq H\leq 90 kOe).

## III Result and discussion

Figure 1 shows the x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of GaCNi_{3} annealed at 950^{\circ}C. As a result of structural refine ment using the standard Rietveld technique, it has single cubic perovskite phase with the space group _Pm3m_, as is found in MgCNi3.1 The refined lattice parameter a is 0.3604(5) nm, which is 5% lower than that of MgCNi3.1 A distinct feature of its crystal structure is the three dimensional network of CNi6 octahedron with carbon atoms in the interstitial positions, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1.

Footnote 1: The _Pm3m_ is the _  effective mass of quasiparticles. According to the analyses of specific heat data in the following text, the value of m^{*}/m_{0} for GaCNi_{3} is as large as about 3.3 due to the strong correlated electrons, thus the contribution of Landau diamagnetic susceptibility to \chi_{0} is negligible, i.e., \chi_{0}\sim\chi_{P}. The parameter A reflects the shape of the density of state (DOS) at the Fermi energy E_{\rm F}.[22, 23]

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity for GaCNi_{3}. It exhibits a metallic behavior in the whole temperature range measured and no superconductivity was found down to 2 K. As can be seen in the inset of Fig. 4, below 70 K the resistivity is satisfied with the equation

\[\rho(T)-\rho_{0}=AT^{2},\] (2)

which is suggestive of a Fermi liquid behavior in the ground state. The residual resistivity \rho_{0} and parameter A are found to be 158.5(3) \mu\Omega cm and 0.0046(2) \mu\Omega cm/K^{2}, respectively. It is known that the residual resistivity can be written as \rho_{0}\proptom^{*}/n\tau_{0}, where m^{*}, n, and \hbar/\tau_{0} represent the effective mass of carriers, mobile carrier concentration, and scattering rate associated with the random potential.[25] Since the effective mass m^{*} for GaCNi_{3} is largely enhanced, the large residual resistivity seems to be reasonable. The large residual resistivity of GaCNi_{3} is similar to that of polycrystalline SrRhO_{3} (142 \mu\Omega cm), which is a strongly enhanced paramagnet close to a magnetic instability with a Wilson ratio of 8.6.[26]

Figure 5 shows the specific heat for GaCNi_{3} measured between 5 and 50 K using a thermal relaxation technique. As shown in the inset of Fig. 5, the data below 18 K, plotted as C(T)/T vs T^{2}, can be well fitted using the following formula:

\[C(T)/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4},\] (3)

where the linear term is the electronic contribution, \gamma, i.e., the Sommerfeld constant, the second term is the phonon contribution according to the Debye approximation, the last term reflects deviations from the linear dispersion of the acoustic modes in extended temperature range. The fitted values of \gamma, \beta, and \delta are equal to 25.3(9) mJ/mol K^{2}, 0.108(1) mJ/mol K^{4} and 1.3(9) x 10^{-4} mJ/mol K^{6}, respectively. By the formula, \Theta_{D}=\frac{(\frac{\pi\times 1.944\times 10^{6}}{\beta})}{\beta}[13], where n is the number of atoms in a unit cell, the Debye temperature \Theta_{D} is 448 K, close to that of ZnCNi_{3} (421 K), but much larger than that of MgCNi_{3} (255.9 K).[19] Comparing the available values of Debye temperature for Ni-based antiperovskite compounds, we can find that the Debye temperature increases with decreasing the lattice parameter a. Namely, the Debye temperature is 255.9, 421, and 448 K for MgCNi_{3}, ZnCNi_{3}, and GaCNi_{3}, corresponding to the lattice parameter a:0.381, 0.366, and 0.3604 nm, respectively. This behavior may be roughly interpreted as follows: the lattice contract leads to a phonon hardening, correspondingly an increase of Debye temperature.[19] The value of \gamma for GaCNi_{3} is comparable to that of MgCNi_{3}, 30 mJ/mol K^{2},[1] but almost 4 times as large as that of ZnCNi_{3} (6.77 mJ/mol K^{2}).[19] In MgCNi_{3}, the large electronic specific heat coefficient is suggested to mainly result from the strong e-p coupling,[17] which supports a superconducting ground state. As will be shown in the following text, the large electronic specific heat coefficient in GaCNi_{3} can be ascribed to the strong electron-electron (e-e) coupling. As to ZnCNi_{3}, the electronic specific heat coefficient is only 6.77(mJ/mol K^{2}), indicating that both the e-e and e-p couplings are weak, in agreement with the Pauli PM ground state.

The Kadowaki-Woods ratio A/\gamma^{2} and the Wilson ratio R_{W}=\frac{\nu\pi\kappa_{B}}{\nu_{B}}\frac{(\frac{n}{2})}{\gamma} are the well-known measures of electron-electron correlation. Here \mu_{B} and \kappa_{B} stands for the Bohr magnon and the Boltzmann constant, respectively. Using the values for the coefficient of T^{2} in low temperature resistivity, A, the electronic specific heat coefficient (i.e., Sommerfeld constant) \gamma, and the temperature independent magnetic susceptibility \chi_{0}, the Kadowaki-Woods ratio A/\gamma^{2} and the Wilson ratio R_{W} are calculated as 7.2 \mu\Omega cm/K^{2} and 9.2, respectively. The value of A/\gamma^{2} here is on the verge of the universal value of about 10 \mu\Omega cm/K^{2} in the heavy fermion systems,[27] suggesting a strongly correlated Fermi liquid behavior in the ground state of GaCNi_{3}. More markedly, the value of R_{W} is much larger than unity, which is expected in free electron gas, and well exceeds the strong correlation limit of 2 according to the Anderson model.[28] Very large values of R_{W} have usually been found in the nearly FM ma

  terials due to the Stoner enhancement, such as Sr3Ru2O7,[24]Pd,[29] and [30] TiBe2 with the value of 10, 6, and 12, respectively.

In order to comprehend the observed behavior, we will refer to the Stoner band theory for itinerant ferromagnetism. Unfortunately, however, as far as we know, no band structure calculation has been performed for GaCNi3. Now we attempt to evaluate the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level (_E_F), _N_(_E_F) for GaCNi3 as follows: The electronic structures of Ni3Ga and Ni3Al have been extensively explored as the reference systems for the studies of the itinerant ferromagnetism and exchange-enhanced paramagnetism.[31] Both of them have the same space group with that of antiperovskite GaCNi3 and AlCNi3, i.e., _Pm3m_, while no interstitial C atoms in the body-centered positions. The total _N_(_E_F) for AlCNi3, 2.61 states/(eV unit),[32] is reduced by 53% when compared with that of Ni3Al, 5.52 states/(eV unit),[33] due to the hybridization between C-2p and Ni-3d states. Assuming the same ratio is also available for Ga-based compounds because of the resemblance of these two systems, _N_(_E_F) of GaCNi3 is estimated to be 1.6 states/(eV spin unit) with the value of 3.4 states/(eV spin unit) for Ni3Ga.[31] The feature in the electronic structure of ACNi3 (A=Mg, Zn, Al, Ga, _et al._) is that there exists a DOS peak below the Fermi level, _E_F. With increasing the lattice parameter a, regardless of the kind of element A, this peak moves to _E_F from the low energy side.[34] Correspondingly _N_(_E_F) increases. In this scenario, the _N_(_E_F) of GaCNi3 should lie between the values of AlCNi3 and ZnCNi3, since its lattice parameter a is larger than AlCNi3 but less than ZnCNi3. So, for GaCNi3,[35] 2.61 <_N_(_E_F) < 4.049 with the unit of states/(eV unit). The above estimated value locates well in this range.

For free electron system without consideration of the correlation between electrons, the Sommerfeld constant g and Pauli PM susceptibility _kh__p_ can be expected as \gamma^{th} =\frac{2}{3}\pi^{2}\kappa_{B}^{2}N(E_{\rm F}) and \chi_{p}^{th}=2 _m__B_2_N_(_E_F). Using 1.6 states/(eV spin unit) as the _N_(_E_F) of GaCNi3, g_{h} and _kh__p__h_ can be estimated as 7.6 mJ/mol K2 and 1.03 x 10-4 cm/mol, respectively. The comparison of the experimental _kh_0 with the theoretical \chi_{p}^{th} leads to a very large Stoner enhancement factor _S_(_S_ = _kh_0/_kh__p__h_ = [1-_IN_(_E_F)]-1) of 30.2, where I is the exchange integral that reflects the exchange splitting of the energy bands. The product of _IN_(_E_F), 0.97, is very close to the Stoner criterion _IN_(_E_F) > 1 for emergence of long range FM order, implying that GaCNi3 is in the proximity of the FM order from the exchange-enhanced Pauli PM side. On the other hand, the enhancement of the effective mass for quasiparticles, _m_+/_m_0 is 3.3, i.e., the ratio of the observed electronic specific heat coefficient g to that of the expected one \gamma^{th}. This effect is related to either _e-p_ coupling or _e-e_ coupling or both. The _e-p_ coupling constant can be estimated by the McMillan's formula,[19]

\[\lambda_{ph} = \left[ \frac{N(E_{F})/\langle F^{2}\rangle}{M(\omega)^{2}} \right\rbrack,\]

where \langle I^{2}\rangle is the averaged electron-ion matrix element squared, M is an atomic mass, and \langle\omega^{2}\rangle the averaged phonon frequency proportional to Debye temperature \Theta_{D}. For GaCNi3, given that \langle I^{2}\rangle and M are the same as in MgCNi3, l_{h} is evaluated to be 0.24, much less than that of MgCNi3, 0.77.[1] Therefore the _e-e_ correlation is the dominant contribution to the observed enhancement in the Sommerfeld constant g. This result corresponds to the large Stoner enhancement of the temperature independent magnetic susceptibility _kh_0. Moreover, such a strong _e-e_ correlation against a weak _e-p_ correlation, together with the low value of _N_(_E_F), may account for the absence of superconductivity in GaCNi3. Now we turn to the relative large value of Wilson ratio in GaCNi3. In the self-consistent renormalization (SCR) theory for nearly and weakly itinerant magnets, the Sommerfeld constant g is suggested to be proportional to \ln[ 1 - IN(E_{F})\rbrack.[36] The increase in \ln[ 1 - IN(E_{F})\rbrack is very modest compared with S when _IN_(_E_F) is approaching unity. Consequently, the value of _R_V is capable of being larger than 2. Using _IN_(_E_F) =0.97, the ratio (absolute value) of the enhancement in _kh_0 to that in g is about 8.8, which is well consistent with the observed _R_W.

To the best of our knowledge, it is possibly the first time to observe such a strong electron-electron correlation in the so-called antiperovskite compounds. Here we note that the electron-electron scattering in GaCNi3 may be as strong as in the two-layered perovskite Sr3Ru2O7 since they have similar _A_/_g_2 and _R_W values.[24] Along with the superconductor MgCNi3, strongly correlated GaCNi3 and other related compounds, it is reminiscent of the Ruddleden-Popper (R-P) type ruthenates (Sr,Ca)_{n+1}Ru_{n}O_{3n+1}, which have been extensively explored in recent years due to their abundant physical properties. Among them, for instance, Sr2RuO4 is a triplet superconductor (for single crystal,[37]T_{\rm C}=1.4 K) connected tightly with the spin fluctuations, i.e., electronic correlation, which has also been discovered in other neighboring compounds, such as FM SrRuO3,[38] nearly FM CaRuO3,[39] and Sr3Ru2O7.[24] The ruthenate perovskites and related layered compounds seem to share some similarities with the nickel based antiperovskites ACNi3 (A=Mg, Zn, Al, Ga, _et al._). First, the characteristic structural unit of RuO6 octahedron, though distorted for some cases can be viewed as the counterpart of CNi6 octahedron in nickel-based antiperovskites. Second, according to theoretical calculations there exists large hybridization between d and p states in both ruthenate perovskites[40] and ACNi3,[2, 33] which would account for the itinerant electronic character and heavily influence the low temperature properties.[41] Last, the emergence of vigorous FM correlation in both families probably has some correlations with the superconductivity, i.e., coexistence or competition. In this context, it suggests that studies as to the differences and analogies between these two families would be beneficial to reveal the relationships if it exists between antiperovskites and oxide perovskites, as well as to shed a light on the nature of superconductivity in MgCNi3.

## IV Conclusion

In summary, the structural, magnetic, electronic transport, and specific heat properties of antiperovskite GaCNi3 have been investigated. The resistivity exhibits quadratic tempera  ture dependence below 70 K. The large values of the Kadowaki-woods ratio A/\gamma^{2} and the Wilson ratio R_{W} indicate a strong electron-electron correlation, being attributed to the instability to FM order. The similarity between the nickel-based antiperovskites, e.g., GaCNi_{3} and MgCNi_{3} and the R-P type ruthenates, e.g., p-wave superconductor Sr_{2}RuO_{4} and strongly correlated Sr_{3}Ru_{2}O_{7} has also been discussed in brief.
