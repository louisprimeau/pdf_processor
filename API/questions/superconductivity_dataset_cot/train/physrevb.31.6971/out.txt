###### Abstract

Magnetic susceptibility and 119Sn Mossbauer studies have been carried out on a new series of rare-earth-containing Heusler alloys having the formula Pd2_R_Sn (_R_ = Tb-Yb). The Tm and Yb compounds in this series along with Lu, Sc, and Y compounds are superconducting. The magnetic susceptibility of Pd2TmSn and Pd3YbSn deviates from the Curie-Weiss behavior at low temperatures indicating that crystalline electric field effects are appreciable. Analysis of the magnetic susceptibility data in terms of crystalline electric fields shows that the ground state of the Tm3+ ion is nonmagnetic which, therefore, does not affect the superconducting state. The susceptibility of Yb3+ ions at low temperatures is also reduced from the free-ion value due to the crystalline electric field interaction. The Tb- and Dy-containing compounds order antiferromagnetically with Neel temperatures of 9 and 15 K, respectively, while Er- and Ho-containing compounds are paramagnetic down to 1.4 K. The hyperfine field at the Sn site in Pd2TbSn is about 50 kOe but is only about 10 kOe in Pd2DySn at 4.2 K.

## I Introduction

Heusler alloys are intermetallic compounds having the general formula X2_YZ_. In the traditional Heusler alloys, X is generally one of the d transition elements such as Cu, Co, Ni, Pd, etc. Y is another d element e.g., Mn, Co; and Z is an _sp_ element such as Al, In, Sn, etc.1 These alloys have the cubic L 2_1 structure and have been extensively studied for their magnetic properties. Recently, alloys of the Heusler composition have been synthesized which contain rare earths (_R_) as one of the constituent elements. These include Pd2_R_Sn,2Ag2_R_In,3 Au2YIn,4 etc. The Pd2_R_Sn compounds form only for heavier rare earths starting from Tb up to Lu (and for Sc and Y), possibly because of the respective sizes of the rare-earth atoms.

In the Pd2_R_Sn series, the lattice parameters indicate that the rare-earth ions are in a trivalent state. It is interesting to note that, in this series, the compounds with R = Tm, Yb, Lu, Y, and Sc exhibit superconductivity. In these compounds the distance between rare-earth atoms is about 4.7 A which is much smaller than the corresponding distance of 6.5 A in the well-known superconducting _R_Mo6S8 compounds.5 Moreover, the exchange interaction between the rare-earth spins and the conduction-electron spins is estimated2 to be about 5 times larger in Pd2_R_Sn (obtained from suppression of _T_c in the presence of magnetic rare-earth impurities in Pd2YSn) than that in _R_Mo6S8 compounds. Therefore, it is somewhat striking that the compounds Pd2TmSn and Pd2YbSn are superconducting in spite of these adverse conditions. In order to understand the magnetism of rare-earth ions in the superconducting Pd2_R_Sn compounds, we have carried out magnetic susceptibility and 119Sn Mossbauer measurements on these compounds. We find that due to the presence of crystalline electric fields, the degeneracy of the ground J multiplet of Tm3+ is lifted, resulting in a nonmagnetic ground state at low temperatures which does not lead to appreciable pair breaking and hence does not suppress superconductivity. The susceptibility of Yb3+ ions is also considerably reduced from the free-ion value due to lifting of the degeneracy of the ground J manifold by crystalline electric fields (CEF). This coupled with the fact that the Lande g factor for Yb3+ is small considerably reduces the pair-breaking effect due to Yb3+ ions, enabling the superconducting state to persist. However, Yb3+, being a Kramer's ion, cannot have zero magnetic moment, and this leads2,6 to magnetic ordering and to the coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetic order in this compound at still lower temperatures. Magnetic susceptibility and 119Sn Mossbauer measurements on the non-superconducting members of Pd2_R_Sn series are also presented.

## II Experimental

The Pd2_R_Sn (_R_ = Tb-Yb) alloys were prepared by arc melting of the stoichiometric amounts of the constituent elements in a purified argon-gas atmosphere. The alloy ingots were turned over and repeatedly melted to obtain homogeneous samples. The ingots were wrapped in tantalum foils, sealed in vacuum and annealed at 800 degC for 7d. Powder x-ray diffraction patterns were obtained using Cu _K_a_ radiation on a Rigaku diffractometer equipped with a monochromator. Susceptibility measurements were carried out in the temperature range 5-300 K using a SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) magnetometer. The superconducting and magnetic ordering temperatures were determined by the use of an ac bridge technique. 119Sn Mossbauer measurements were carried out at various temperatures using a conventional transmission Mossbauer spectrometer with a CaSnO3 source held at room temperature. The absorbers of Heusler compounds were cooled down to 1.5 K in a liquid-helium cryostat.

 

## III Results and Discussion

Room-temperature powder x-ray diffraction studies showed that all the Pd2_R_Sn (_R_ = Tb-Yb) compounds were single-phase materials having the cubic L 21 structure, which is shown in Fig. 1. The lattice constants determined by the least-squares fit of observed d values are given in Table **I**. The results of magnetic susceptibility (both ac and dc) and 119Sn Mossbauer measurements for each of the compounds are discussed below and also summarized in Table **I**.

### Pd2TmSn

ac susceptibility measurements showed that this compound becomes superconducting with a transition temperature of 2.82 K. The dc magnetization at 5 K is observed to vary linearly with the applied field consistent with the paramagnetic nature of the compound. Therefore, the temperature dependence of magnetization was investigated in a fixed field of 5 kOe. Figure 2 shows the plot of inverse molar susceptibility versus temperature for Pd2TmSn. Above about 50 K the susceptibility follows a Curie-type (_C/T_) behavior, where C is the Curie constant, with an effective paramagnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff}= 7.4\mu_{B} which is close to the value for the free ion. However, below about 50 K, deviation from the Curie-type behavior is observed, although it is not very pronounced. The deviation is seen more clearly by plotting effective moment \mu_{\rm eff}= (3_kTX__M_/_N_m_^2)1/2 versus temperature. If X_{M} varies as _C/T_, then \mu_{\rm eff}(_T_) should be independent of temperature. However, the observed \mu_{\rm eff}(_T_) deviates from a constant value at low temperatures. The deviation from the Curie-type behavior is ascribed to CEF effects.

In the Heusler L 21 cubic structure of Pd2_R_Sn alloys, the R ion occupies a site of local cubic symmetry. Thus, it is subject to a cubic CEF, the Hamiltonian for which can be written as

\[{\cal K} = B_{4}^{0}(O_{4}^{0} + 5O_{4}^{4} ) + B_{6}^{0}(O_{6}^{0} - 21O_{6}^{4} )\ ,\]

where O_{n}^{m} are the Steven's operators in terms of the angular-momentum operators and are given in Ref. 7. B_{4}^{0} and B_{6}^{0} are, respectively, the strength of fourth- and sixth-degree terms in the CEF Hamiltonian. It is con

\[{\cal K}_{\rm CEF} = W[ \, x \, (O_4^0 + 5O_4^4)/F(4) + (1 - | \, x \, |\, \,  tures of Pd_{2}RSn compounds do not follow the de Gennes rule.[11] The magnetic susceptibilities of Pd_{2}HoSn and Pd_{2}ErSn are independent of the applied field and follow Curie-Weiss behavior with some deviations at very low temperatures (Fig. 4). Again, the deviations are presumably due to CEF effects. The effective paramagnetic moments (obtained from susceptibility data above 50 K) are close to the free-ion values for the corresponding trivalent rare-earth ions. The susceptibility has not been analyzed in terms of CEF splitting. ^{119}Sn Mossbauer measurements show a single line throughout the temperature range of 1.4 to 300 K in both these compounds.

### Pd_{2}TbSn and Pd_{2}DySn

ac susceptibility measurements indicate that these compounds are magnetically ordered at low temperature. This is also borne out by the dc magnetic susceptibility measurements (Figs. 5 and 6) in 5 kOe applied field. A peak in the susceptibility is observed at 9 K in Pd_{2}TbSn and at 15 K in Pd_{2}DySn indicative of the antiferromagnetic ordering of the rare-earth sublattice in these compounds. In the paramagnetic state the susceptibilities of both these compounds follow Curie-Weiss behavior with effective paramagnetic moments close to those of the respective free trivalent rare-earth ions.

It should be mentioned that both these compounds undergo a low-temperature crystallographic transformation to a low symmetry phase.[12] Hence, the CEF experienced by the rare earth (Tb and Dy) will have a major axial term (B_{2}^{0}). This can indeed generate the nearly-free-ion moment in the ground state depending on the sign of the B_{2}^{0} term.

  ^{119}Sn Mossbauer measurements yield a single line in both compounds at 300 K and at 77 K with a width of 0.95 mm/sec. On lowering the temperature below the Neel temperature, the ^{119}Sn Mossbauer in Pd_{2}TbSn gives rise to a hyperfine split pattern from which the field at the Sn site is estimated to be about 50 kOe. However, in Pd_{2}DySn, only line broadening in the Mossbauer patterns is observed in the magnetically ordered state (see Figs. 7 and 8). Thus, the transferred hyperfine field at the Sn site in Pd_{2}DySn is small and is estimated to be about 10 kOe. The difference in the field at the Sn site in Tb and Dy compounds may be because of the different types of antiferromagnetic ordering of the rare-earth moments in the two compounds. Neutron-diffraction measurements are needed to obtain the magnetic structure in the ordered state.

## IV Conclusions

In conclusion, magnetic and ^{119}Sn Mossbauer studies have been carried out on a new series of rare-earth containing Heusler alloys of the type Pd_{2}_R_Sn (R\!=\!Tb-Yb). Some of these exhibit superconductivity while others in this series are magnetically ordered. The CEF's are found to be appreciable in the Tm and Yb compounds, which become superconducting at low temperatures. The ground state of Tm^{3+} in Pd_{2}TmSn is a nonmagnetic doublet \Gamma_{3}. The low-temperature susceptibility of Yb^{3+} in Pd_{2}YbSn is also reduced from the free-ion value and the resulting ground state is either \Gamma_{6} or \Gamma_{7}. The Tb- and Dy-containing compounds order antiferromagnetically while Er- and Ho-containing compounds are paramagnets down to 1.4 K. The hyperfine field at the Sn site is very different in antiferromagnetically ordered Pd_{2}TbSn than that in Pd_{2}DySn.
