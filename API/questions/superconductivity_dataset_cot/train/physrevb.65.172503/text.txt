###### Abstract

We prepared MgB\({}_{2-x}\)Be\({}_{x}\) (\(x\!=\!0\), 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.6) samples where B is substituted with Be. MgB\({}_{2}\) structure is maintained up to \(x\!=\!0.6\). In-plane and interplane lattice constants were found to decrease and increase, respectively. The superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) decreases with \(x\). We found that the \(T_{c}\) decrease is correlated with in-plane contraction but is insensitive to carrier doping, which is consistent with other substitution studies such as Mg\({}_{1-x}\)Al\({}_{x}\)B\({}_{2}\) and MgB\({}_{2-x}\)Ca . Implication of this work is discussed in terms of the two-dimensional nature of the \(\sigma\) band.

## I Introduction

The recent discovery of superconductivity in MgB\({}_{2}\) at \(T_{c}\!=\!39\) K has drawn enormous attention to its structural and electrical properties.[1] The borons form the graphitic planes and magnesiums supply charges in the planes. The resulting carriers are holes in the \(\sigma\)-band.[2] Most theoretical works suggest that coupling of the \(\sigma\) hole with a B-plane phonon is the key ingredient of the superconductivity in this compound.[3, 4, 5] This phonon-mediated BCS mechanism is consistent with the boron isotope effect.[6]

There have been many attempts to change \(T_{c}\) through chemical substitution in Mg or B sites. For example, Al substitution on a Mg site[7] and C substitution on the boron plane are reported.[8] Such chemical substitutions change the physical quantities of the system such as hole density, lattice constants, etc. However, there is no detailed understanding of the effect of substitution on the observed \(T_{c}\) change even within the BCS frame.

In this paper, we prepared a series of MgB\({}_{2-x}\)Be\({}_{x}\), where B is substituted with Be in the plane.[9] With this substitution, the in-plane B-B distance decreases while the interplane distance increases. Our thermopower measurement showed that the \(\sigma\) hole increases with Be, as reported in an independent paper.[10] We compare our result with other substituted compounds and find that the \(T_{c}\) change is insensitive to the carrier doping. Instead, we show that the in-plane B-B distance is closely correlated with the \(T_{c}\) change in the low-doping region. This result is consistent with the two-dimensional (2D) nature of the \(\sigma\) band.[4]

## II Experiment

Polycrystalline samples were synthesized with the powder metallurgical technique under high pressure. Starting materials were fine powders of Mg (99.8%, Alfa Aesar), amorphous B (99.99%, Alfa Aesar), and Be (99. + %, Alfa Aesar). Stoichiometric amounts of powders were mixed and pelletized. The pellets were placed in a tungsten vessel with a close-fitting cap, then reacted for 2 h at 850 degC under 20 atm of high-purity argon atmosphere.

An x-ray diffraction (XRD) \(\theta\)-2 \(\theta\) scan measurement was performed using a Rigaku RINT d-max. Figure 1(a) shows the results for \(x\!=\!0\), 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 1.0. Most of the reflections correspond to AlB\({}_{2+}\)-type patterns. Also, minor impurity phases such as MgO and BeO are found as indicated by \(\bigtriangledown\) and *, respectively. Note that the MgB\({}_{2}\) structure is maintained up to \(x\!=\!0.6\). At higher compositions (\(x\!=\!1.4\) and 2.0, not shown here), we find that Be\({}_{13}\)Mg becomes the main phase. In Fig. 1(b), the shifts of the (002) and (110) reflections are shown in expanded scales. As \(x\) increases, the (002)

 reflection shifts to a lower angle while the (110) reflection moves to the opposite direction. This indicates that the in-plane lattice constant \(a\) decreases and the interplane distance \(c\) increases with \(x\).[11] To obtain the lattice parameters, we performed refinement analysis using the reitan-2000 program [12] and used MgO and BeO as internal standards.

In order to study superconducting property, dc magnetization was measured using a dc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design). Figure 2 shows the magnetization \(M(T)\) of MgB\({}_{2-x}\)Be\({}_{x}\). In this measurement, samples were first zero-field cooled (ZFC) and data were measured with increasing temperature under \(H\) = 10 Oe. Note that the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) decreases with \(x\). In the figure, the magnetization is normalized with the saturated value at \(T\) =5 K. The transition width \(\Delta T_{c}\) was determined from 10%\(-\)90% the transition.

## III III. Result and Discussion

In Fig. 3, we summarize the XRD and \(T_{c}\) results. The upper panel shows the lattice constants \(a\) and \(c\). \(T_{c}\) and \(\Delta T_{c}\) are shown in the lower panel. With Be doping, \(a\) decreases while \(c\) increases. Note that the change in \(c\) (\(\sim\)3.3%) is much larger than that in \(a\) (\(\sim\)0.7%). The transition temperature \(T_{c}\) decreases but \(\Delta T_{c}\) shows a maximum near \(x\) = 0.3. This is an interesting result, because normally the superconducting transition becomes broader with random substitutions. We associate this anomalous behavior of \(\Delta T_{c}\) with the structural data: we note that the (002) reflection is the most broad at \(x\) = 0.3 in Fig. 1(b), which indicates considerable distribution in the \(c\) value, possibly due to the two stable phases at \(x\) = 0 and \(x\) = 0.6. This effect may increase \(\Delta T_{c}\) at intermediate \(x\) values. Considering the drastic change of \(T_{c}\), the transition width will be more meaningful when it is nor

(b) \(T_{c}\) vs in-plane lattice contraction \(-\Delta a/a_{0}\). (c) shows an expanded view of the low-doping region of (b). Experimental data are shown with symbols: MgB\({}_{2-x}\)Be\({}_{x}\) (\(\bullet\)), MgI\({}_{1-x}\)Al\({}_{x}\)B\({}_{2}\) (\(\square\)), and MgB\({}_{2-x}\)C\({}_{x}\) (\(\Diamond\)). Results of high-pressure measurement for pristine MgB\({}_{2}\) are shown for comparison (dashed lines), based on the experimental results below 1 GPa (Ref. 13). Solid and dash-dotted lines are guides for the eye.

  malized with \(T_{c}\). As shown with open squares, the ratio \(\Delta T_{c}/T_{c}\) increases with \(x\).

Now let us consider the \(T_{c}\) change. To see a possible correlation of \(T_{c}\) with lattice parameters, we first plot \(T_{c}\) vs \(c\) in Fig. 4(a). Our results for MgB\({}_{2-x}\)Be\({}_{x}\) are shown as solid circles. For comparison, the results for Mg\({}_{1-x}\)Al\({}_{x}\)B\({}_{2}\) (open squares) (Ref. 7) and MgB\({}_{2-x}\)C\({}_{x}\) (open circles) (Ref. 8) are also shown. In MgB\({}_{2-x}\)Be\({}_{x}\), \(c\) expands with the substitution while it contracts in Mg\({}_{1-x}\)Al\({}_{x}\)B\({}_{2}\). For MgB\({}_{2-x}\)C\({}_{x}\), \(c\) remains almost unchanged. For all these three different cases, \(T_{c}\) decreases and there is no correlation between \(T_{c}\) and \(c\). This indicates that the inter layer distance is not directly related to \(T_{c}\).

Next, we examine the \(T_{c}\) vs \(a\) relation in Fig. 4(b). For all samples, \(a\) shrinks with the substitutions. Along with the \(a\) decrease, \(T_{c}\) decreases linearly. With further contraction, sudden drops are found for MgB\({}_{2-x}\)Be\({}_{x}\) and Mg\({}_{1-x}\)Al\({}_{x}\)B\({}_{2}\). This indicates some abrupt changes in the samples, for example structural instability like buckling or ordering in the plane. It is useful to compare the linear \(T_{c}\) decrease with the result of high-pressure experiments on pristine MgB\({}_{2}\) (dashed line): As external pressure is applied, the lattice is compressed and \(T_{c}\) is found to decrease.[13] [The dashed line in Fig. 4(a) represents the pressure result for \(c\) compression.] Note that the \(T_{c}\) decrease in substituted compounds is similar to the pressure line when the contraction (\(-\,\Delta a/a_{0}\)) is small.

In Fig. 4(c), we examine the low-contraction region more closely. Note that the data of the two compounds (Be, and Al substituted) fall nearly on the same line (see the solid guide line). It is interesting that the \(T_{c}\) change occurs in the same direction (decrease) for both electron [Al (Ref. 16)] and hole [Be (Ref. 10)] doping. In fact, such a behavior is predicted theoretically by An and Pickett[4]: their band calculation for MgB\({}_{2}\) shows that the in-plane \(\sigma\) band is highly 2D like and the DOS is nearly constant with energy. In this case, the Fermi level shift due to carrier doping will not affect \(T_{c}\). Our observation is consistent with this prediction.

Our results suggest that the \(a\) contraction plays the key role in the observed \(T_{c}\) decrease. According to the BCS analysis of MgB\({}_{2}\),[17] the shrinkage in \(a\) leads to a decrease in the density of states (DOS), an increase in the phonon frequency, and a decrease in the electron-phonon coupling. As a result, \(T_{c}\) decreases.[14; 15; 18] Note that for Al- and Be-substituted samples, \(T_{c}\) decreases somewhat faster than the pressure line, suggesting that some additional effects such as, for example, structural randomness arise by the substitution. It is interesting that in MgB\({}_{2-x}\)C\({}_{x}\), the slope is close to the pressure line, suggesting that the additional effects are minimal.[19] Our observation points to a possible \(T_{c}\) increase if \(a\) could be expanded.[20] In fact, Medvedeva _et al._ predicted that higher \(T_{c}\) may be obtained in lattice-expanded cases such as the hypothetical CaB\({}_{2}\).[21]

It is interesting to compare our results with the theoretical prediction on MgB\({}_{2-x}\)Be\({}_{x}\) by Mehl _et al.[11]_ According to their calculation, the lattice constant \(a\) increases with \(x\), opposite to our observation. At this point, it is not clear where the discrepancy arises from. As one possibility, we speculate that Be substituted in the B plane may actually exist in a partially ionic state rather than in a perfect covalent state. In this case, the Be radius is smaller than its covalent radius, which can result in the in-plane contraction.[22]

## IV Conclusion

In this work, we studied the structural and superconducting properties of MgB\({}_{2-x}\)Be\({}_{x}\) (\(x\!=\!0\), 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.6). In-plane and interplane lattice constants were found to decrease and increase respectively with Be substitution. While \(T_{c}\) decreases with \(x\) monotonically, \(\Delta T_{c}\) shows a maximum at \(x\!=\!0.3\). From our results and other substitution studies (Al and C substitution), we found that the \(T_{c}\) change is correlated with the in-plane contraction and is independent of the carrier doping. This is consistent with the 2D nature of the \(\sigma\) band.
