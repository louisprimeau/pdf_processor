###### Abstract

The superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) in nonmagnetic Lu1-xLaNi2B2C (_x_  0.1) linearly decreases with the structural parameter _c_'/_a_ as _dT__c_/_d_(_c_'/_a_)=210(20) K. The same decrease of _dT__c_/_d_(_c_'/_a_) has been observed for the other nonmagnetic series Lu1-xYNi2B2C (_x_  0.1) [J. Freudenberger, S. L. Drechsler, G. Fuchs, A. Kreyssig, K. Nenkov, S. V. Shulga, K.-H. Muller, and L. Schultz, Physica C **306**, 1 (1998); J. Freudenberger, Paarbrecheng in Seltened-Ubergangsmetall-Borkarbiden, Thesis, TU, Dresden, 2000]. The decrease in \(T_{c}\) for the antiferromagnetically (AF) ordered compounds RNi2B2C (_R_ = Dy,Ho,Er,Tm) and for nonmagnetic LuNiBC again scales as [_dT__c_/_d_(_c_'/_a_)]=200(10)K. This is a strong indication that in nonmagnetic and AF ordered _R_Ni2B2C as well as _R_NiBC compounds \(T_{c}\) is determined by _c_'/_a_ which is a measure for the deviation of the NiB4 tetrahedra from ideal tetrahedral symmetry.

## I Introduction

Since the discovery of superconductivity in the quaternary rare earth (_R_) nickel borocarbides _R_Ni2B2C in 1994 (Refs. 1 and 2) the main interest in the study of these compounds was to understand the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism occurring in this class of materials. In order to understand the variation of the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) within the series of _R_Ni2B2C compounds, for example, attempts have been made to correlate \(T_{c}\) with the de Gennes scaling parameter \(G\) = (\(g_{J}\) - 1)2_J_(_J_ + 1) (\(g_{J}\) and \(J\) being the Lande \(g\) factor and total angular momentum of the \(R\)3+ ion, respectively).3-5 We will not discuss this point any further for the moment but will come back to it at the end of this paper.

The variation of \(T_{c}\) for _non_-magnetic _R_Ni2B2C compounds, on the other hand, e.g., the fact that LuNi2B2C has the highest \(T_{c}\) of all superconducting _R_Ni2B2C compounds while LuNi2B2C is not superconducting at all or the change of \(T_{c}\) within the series Y1-xLa,Ni2B2C (Ref. 6) or Lu1-xYNi2B2C (Ref. 7), definitely has other reasons. Band structure calculations by Mattheiss _et al.8_ explain why LuNi2B2C has such a high \(T_{c}\) and LuNi2B2C is not superconducting: in LuNi2B2C the Fermi energy has its position at a relatively high density of states (DOS), while it is at a low value of the DOS for LuNi2B2C. As it was further pointed out in this paper, high DOS at the Fermi energy happens to coincide with ideal tetrahedral symmetry of the Ni2B4 tetrahedra forming the Ni2-B2 layers which are responsible for the superconductivity. Recent calculations by Divis _et al.9_ essentially come to the same conclusion about the DOS. In order to confirm the idea that deviations from the ideal tetrahedral symmetry of the NiB4 tetrahedra are responsible for the variation of \(T_{c}\) in _non_-magnetic _R_Ni2B2C compounds more experimental data for \(T_{c}\) in such compounds are needed. It is for this reason that we have studied the system Lu1-xLa,Ni2B2C. Furthermore, such studies offer the possibility to compare this system with the series Lu1-xY,Ni2B2C (Ref. 7) that we have already studied. Preliminary results already have been published elsewhere.10

## II Sample preparation and characterization

Polycrystalline Lu1-xLa,Ni2B2C samples were prepared by conventional arc melting of stoichiometric amounts of pure elements in an Ar atmosphere.6 The room temperature x-ray diffraction measurements were performed on powdered samples with a Rigaku Miniflex diffractometer using Cu K\(\alpha\) radiation. Rietveld analysis was used to obtain the lattice parameters of the samples. Alternating current (ac) susceptibility measurements were done in a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer in the temperature range between 4.2 and 30 K. Four probe resistance measurements were made using a Linear Research ac bridge (model LR700) in the temperature range 2\(K\)  \(T\)  300 K.

The x-ray analysis of Lu1-xLa,Ni2B2C was done in a similar way as previously made for the Y1-xLa,Ni2B2C system.6 Single phase (less than 3% impurity phase) with good crystallinity only was found for samples with compositions close to the Lu and La ends (Fig. 1). For La concentrations between 0.02 and 0.9 (miscibility gap) two phases with LuNi2B2C type of structure were found which we assign to a Lu-rich and a La-rich phase, respectively. A similar miscibility gap has been reported for other La diluted _R_Ni2B2C compounds.6,11 Figure 1 shows the results of the Rietveld analysis assuming the presence of the earlier-mentioned two phases for the samples with \(x\) = 0.02, 0.07, and 0.9, which correspond to nominal concentrations of 0.1, 0.6, and 0.9, respectively (see later, and Table I). As expected, the analysis shows that the La-rich phase increases with increasing lanthanum concentration.

The reduction of the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) with La substitution can be seen in Fig. 2. Taking into account that LaNi2B2C is not superconducting, it is natural to suppose that \(T_{c}\) of LuNi2B2C is reduced by substitution of Lu by La. Therefore, we attribute the superconducting transition observed by ac susceptibility and ac resistance measurements (see Fig. 2) to the Lu-rich phase. An apparent nonsystematic change of \(T_{c}\) with increasing nominal La concentration would be seen if the mismatch between nominal and real concentration is not taken into account. In fact, _real_  concentration in the Lu-rich phase does not correspond to the nominal La concentration due to the presence of the earlier-mentioned two phases in the sample. The real La concentration \(x\) in the Lu-rich phase has been calculated (see Table 1) by making the assumption that the lattice parameters linearly vary, going from pure LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C to pure LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (see Ref. 6). It is important to mention that the calculated values of the real concentration are not relevant for the main conclusion of this paper drawn from the data in Fig. 5. The room-temperature normal-state resistivities are between \(\sim\)100 and 200 \(\mu\)D cm, somewhat higher than what is observed in single crystal [12] but agree with that for polycrystalline samples. [2]

## III Experimental results and discussion

The parameter _c\({}^{\prime}\)/a_ (_c\({}^{\prime}\)_ is the distance of the two _R_-C layers between which the NiB\({}_{4}\) tetrahedra are sandwiched and \(a\) is the lattice parameter in the basal plane) has been found to be the relevant parameter determining the tetrahe

This finding results from \({}^{57}\)Fe Mossbauer effect studies of various _R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (_R_ = Y, Er, Ho, Dy, Tb, Gd, Nd, Pr) and _R_NiBC (_R_ = Y, Er, Ho, Dy, Tb, Gd) compounds.\({}^{13}\) The quadrupole splitting \(|\Delta E_{Q}|\) at the \({}^{57}\)Fe (Ni) site linearly scales with \(c^{\prime}/a\) for _all_ compounds studied. Since \(|\Delta E_{Q}|\) is a measure for the deviation from ideal tetrahedral symmetry (\(\Delta E_{Q}\)=0 for ideal tetrahedral symmetry) this linear correlation between \(|\Delta E_{Q}|\) and \(c^{\prime}/a\) clearly proofs that it is indeed the (\(c^{\prime}/a\)) parameter which determines the deviation from ideal tetrahedral symmetry. In Fig. 3(a) we have plotted \(c^{\prime}/a\) for Lu\({}_{1-x}\)La\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C as a function of the real La concentration \(x\) obtained from the lattice parameters (see earlier) together with \(c^{\prime}/a\) for Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Y\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C given in Ref. 7. As can be seen from this figure the change of \(c^{\prime}/a\) with \(x\) is a factor of about 4.5 larger for La doping compared to that for Y doping [\(d(c^{\prime}/a)/dx\) = -0.20 and -0.045 for La and Y doping, respectively]. This is what one would expect, since the difference in the ionic radii between Lu and La is \(\Delta r\)(Lu\(-\)La) = -0.0223 nm which is about a factor of 4 larger than the corresponding \(\Delta r\) for Y doping [\(\Delta r\)(Lu\(-\)Y) = -0.0057 nm].

Figure 3(b) shows the \(T_{c}\) values as obtained from resistance (_R_) as well as susceptibility (\(\chi^{\prime}\)) measurements as a function of \(x\) for Lu\({}_{1-x}\)La\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. As can be seen from this figure, the agreement between the results of the two measuring methods is quite good. In addition we have plotted in Fig. 3(b) the \(T_{c}\) values as given for Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Y\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C in Ref. 7. It shows that the influence of La doping on \(T_{c}\) again is a factor of about 4.5 larger than that for Y doping (\(dT_{c}\)/dx = -42 K and -8.5 K for La and Y doping, respectively).

If we now plot \(T_{c}\) vs \(c^{\prime}/a\), we find that the \(T_{c}\) reduction \(\Delta T_{c}\) in _both_ systems Lu\({}_{1-x}\)La\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Y\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C scales with \(c^{\prime}/a\) in exactly the same way (see Fig. 4). The straight line drawn through the data points in Fig. 4 is a least-square fit with the slope [\(dT_{c}/d(c^{\prime}/a)\)]=210(20)K.

This is quite a remarkable result since it shows that the \(T_{c}\) reduction just scales with \(c^{\prime}/a\) or with the deviation from ideal tetrahedral symmetry of the NiB\({}_{4}\) tetrahedra, independent of the size of the doping atom. Usually it is assumed\({}^{14}\) that the \(T_{c}\) reduction is caused by local lattice distortions due to the different sizes of the host and doping rare earth ion. Since this effect usually scales as \(\alpha\Delta r^{2}\) (Refs. 14-16) one would expect that the \(T_{c}\) reduction for a given \(x\) should be a factor of about 20 larger for La doping than in the case of Y doping. This, however, is not observed: the experiments clearly show that \(\Delta T_{c}\) scales approximately with \(\Delta r\) and \(not\) with \(\Delta r^{2}\). We should mention at this point that magnetic dilution of _antiferromagnetically ordered_ (AF) DyNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C with La and Y, respectively, indeed reduces \(T_{c}\) by a factor which scales with \(\Delta r^{2}\) (Refs. 14-16). This reduction, however, is due to a _magnetic pair-breaking_ effect\({}^{17}\) which is not relevant in the nonmagnetic systems we are discussing here.

In the following we want to bring another argument why the \(T_{c}\) reduction in Lu\({}_{1-x}\)La\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Y\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, respectively, is not caused by local lattice distortions due to different ionic radii but rather due to the deviation of the NiB\({}_{4}\) tetrahedra from ideal tetrahedral symmetry. Fuchs _et al.\({}^{18}\)_ analyzing all existing experimental data for the series Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Y\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, suggest that the local lattice distortions due to different sizes of the Y and Lu ions mainly reduces the electron-phonon coupling constant \(\lambda_{c\text{-ph}}\). The change in the DOS at the Fermi level, on the other hand, is too small to explain the measured change in the Sommerfeld constant. Whereas it is not quite clear how local lattice distortions will

  reduce \(\uplambda_{c\text{-ph}}\), our finding, namely, that the \(T_{c}\) reduction scales with \(c^{\prime}/a\) can explain the reduction of \(\uplambda_{c\text{-ph}}\); as it has been pointed out by Mattheiss _et al._,[8] the NiB\({}_{4}\) tetrahedra in LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C have almost ideal tetrahedral symmetry. This fact also is "ideal" for superconductivity since in this case an \(s\text{-}p\) band, which exhibits strong electron-phonon coupling, happens to coincide with the Fermi level. Changing \(c^{\prime}/a\), i.e., changing the B-Ni-B bonding angles in the NiB\({}_{4}\) tetrahedra, therefore, will shift this \(s\text{-}p\) band and reduces the electron-phonon interaction.

Having discussed in detail the reason for the variation of \(T_{c}\) in nonmagnetic \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C superconductors, we now will switch to the nonmagnetic superconductor LuNiBC and to the AF ordered superconductors \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C with \(R\) = Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm. We will ask the question, how much of the \(T_{c}\) reduction in these systems is caused by the deviation of the NiB\({}_{4}\) tetrahedra from ideal tetrahedral symmetry. For that reason we have plotted in Fig. 5 the \(T_{c}\) values of all these compounds as a function of the (\(c^{\prime}/a\)) parameter together with the data points of the nonmagnetic \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compounds already displayed in Fig. 4. Most surprisingly _all_ data points fall on the same line, i.e., for _all_ of these compounds the relation between \(T_{c}\) and \(c^{\prime}/a\) is the same. The straight line through the data points of nonmagnetic LuNiBC and the AF ordered \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compounds in Fig. 5 is a least-squares fit with [\(dT_{c}/d\)(\(c^{\prime}/a\))]=220(10)K. This value is within the experimental errors of the same as that found for the nonmagnetic Lu\({}_{1-x}R_{x}^{\prime}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (\(R^{\prime}\) = La, Y) compounds (see Fig. 4). For that reason we can make the following two conclusions:

(i) the difference in \(T_{c}\) between nonmagnetic LuNiBC and LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C is due to the change of \(c^{\prime}/a\) or the deviation of the NiB\({}_{4}\) tetrahedra in LuNiBC from the ideal tetrahedral symmetry and

(ii) \(T_{c}\) in AF ordered \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compounds (\(R\) = Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm) essentially is determined by \(c^{\prime}/a\) or by the deviation of the NiB\({}_{4}\) tetrahedra from ideal tetrahedral symmetry; the influence of the \(R\) magnetic moments on \(T_{c}\) seems to be very small. An exception is Tm where there is a reduction in \(T_{c}\) (see Fig. 5) caused by the fact that only for Tm we have \(T_{c}\) \(\gg\)\(T_{N}\), i.e., superconductivity occurs in the paramagnetic state.

Conclusion (i) gives a natural explanation for the missing superconductivity in all the other \(R\)NiBC compounds: \(c^{\prime}/a\) in all other \(R\)NiBC compounds is smaller than in LuNiBC and smaller than (\(c^{\prime}/a\))\({}_{\text{crit}}\) = 1.457 (see Fig. 5). We are aware of the fact that conclusion (ii) is in clear contradiction with the generally accepted opinion that de Gennes scaling is the reason for the decrease of \(T_{c}\) with increasing \(R\) magnetic moment in these compounds. Nevertheless, the striking agreement in the correlation between \(T_{c}\) and \(c^{\prime}/a\) for the nonmagnetic and AF ordered \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C superconductors should be taken as an experimental fact which cannot be overlooked.

One of the strongest arguments against the plot shown in Fig. 5 is the fact that the data point for YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C is far above the line drawn in Fig. 5, i.e., the \(T_{c}\) value for this compound is much higher than expected from its (\(c^{\prime}/a\)) parameter. Even if we have no really satisfactory explanation for this fact, we want to bring up two points: (i) in another family of magnetic superconductors, namely, the Chevrel phases \(R\)Mo\({}_{6}\)S\({}_{8}\), \(T_{c}\) essentially scales with the volume \(V\); again Y is _not_ fitting in the \(T_{c}\) vs \(V\) relation obtained for all rare earth atoms;[21] (ii) the change of \(T_{c}\) in the nonmagnetic series Y\({}_{1-x}\)La\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C is [\(dT_{c}/d\)(\(c^{\prime}/a\))]=293 K (Ref. 6); this value is even somewhat larger than that found for the other nonmagnetic \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compounds, again indicating that \(T_{c}\) in YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C is too high if compared with the other \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compounds.

As a final conclusion, we have clear experimental evidence that \(T_{c}\) in nonmagnetic, superconducting Lu\({}_{1-x}\)La\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Y\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (Ref. 7) is determined by the structural parameter \(c^{\prime}/a\). This indicates that it is the deviation from the ideal tetrahedral symmetry of the NiB\({}_{4}\) tetrahedra which reduces \(T_{c}\) in Lu\({}_{1-x}R_{x}^{\prime}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (\(R^{\prime}\) = La, Y) relative to LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. There seems to be additional experimental evidence that the \(T_{c}\) reduction in AF ordered \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compounds is _not_ due to the \(R\) magnetic moments but rather caused by deviations of the NiB\({}_{4}\) tetrahedra from ideal tetrahedral symmetry. This last finding is rather controversial, but we hope that it will trigger more theoretical work on the subject of \(T_{c}\) in nonmagnetic and AF ordered superconducting \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compounds.
