###### Abstract

The synthesis and properties of LiFeAs, a high-_T_{c}_ Fe-based superconducting stoichiometric compound, are reported. Single crystal x-ray studies reveal that it crystallizes in the tetragonal PbFCl type (P4/nmm) with a = 3.7914(7) A  and c = 6.364(2) A. Unlike the known isoelectronic undoped intrinsic FeAs compounds, LiFeAs does not show any spin-density wave behavior but exhibits superconductivity at ambient pressures without chemical doping. It exhibits a respectable transition temperature of _T_{c}_ = 18 K with electronlike carriers and a very high critical field, H_{c}2(0) > 80 T. LiFeAs appears to be the chemical equivalent of the infinite layered compound of the high-_T_{c}_ cuprates.

Until recently the chemical realm of high-_T_{c}_ superconductivity had been limited mainly to copper oxide-based layered perovskites. The latest search for noncuprate superconductors in strongly correlated electron layered systems has led to the discovery of high-_T_{c}_ superconductivity in doped quaternary rare-earth iron oxypnictides, _R_OFePn (_R_ = rare-earth metal and Ph=pnciogen).[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 5 equipped with a charge coupled device (CCD) area detector. A crystal with dimensions of 0.28 x 0.14 x 0.02 mm^{3} was mounted in glass fiber under a stream of cold nitrogen gas at -58 ^{\circ}C. Monochromatic Mo Ka1 radiation (=0.71073 A) was used to collect a full hemisphere of data with the narrow-frame method. The data were integrated using the Siemens SAINT program, and the intensities were corrected for Lorentz factor, polarization, air absorption, and absorption due to variation in the path length. Empirical absorption correction was applied using a lamina-shaped model and redundant reflections were averaged. Final unit-cell parameters were refined using 512 reflections having I>10\sigma(I).

Results of the single-crystal refinement also confirm the conclusions from the chemical analyses. LiFeAs crystallizes in a tetragonal unit cell (P4/nmm) with a=3.7914(7) A and c=6.364(2) A. The major structural parameters are summarized in Table 1. The crystal structure of LiFeAs, as shown in Fig. 1, is isostructural with the PbFCl type, different from previous reports [10]. It is also different from the superconducting alkali and alkaline-earth metal iron arsenides, (A/Ae)Fe_{2}As_{2} (A= K, Rb, and Cs; Ae=Sr and Ba), which crystallize in the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} type. However, it is closely related to the "empty" version of LaOFeAs (ZrCuSiAs type). As in LaOFeAs, LiFeAs features Fe_{2}As_{2} layers based on edge-shared tetrahedral FeAs_{4} units. The Fe_{2}As_{2} layers can also be derived from the alternate As capping of the Fe square nets, above and below each center of the Fe squares. The Fe-As bond distance within the layers is 2.4204(4) A; the nearest Fe-Fe distance is 2.6809(4) A. The Fe_{2}As_{2} layers are alternately stacked along the c axis with nominal double layers of Li atoms. The parallel stacking of the FeAs layers in LiFeAs inhibits close interlayer contacts between As atoms. This is different from the "slipped" stacking in (A, Ae)Fe_{2}As_{2} wherein adjacent Fe_{2}As_{2} layers are oriented by a mirror plane perpendicular to c passing through z =1/2, which allows closer, yet nonbonding, As-As interlayer distances. Although the interlayer distances in LiFeAs [3.182(2) A] are shorter than the ROFeAs phases, the nearest interlayer As-As distances are long [4.2929(7) A]. More importantly, unlike LaOFeAs, the nominal tetrahedral sites within the nominal Li-double layers [Li-Li distances of 3.3218(4) A, as shown in Fig. 1] do not have any notable electron densities and thus are unoccupied.

The results of our structure determination are different from the conclusions of Wang _et al._, [11] which do not agree with the results of our work in terms of the important aspects of chemical composition of the superconducting phase and the crystal structure. Furthermore, we observed superconductivity in the stoichiometric compound with an elemental ratio Li:Fe:As of 1:1:1 in contrast to the conclusion of Ref. [11], suggesting that a substantial deficiency of Li is needed to induce superconductivity. It is therefore important to verify the real composition that may deviate from the nominal composition if impurity phases form during the synthesis process. The x-ray spectra shown in Fig. 2 do not indicate any impurity phase within the resolution of the measurement.

  Furthermore, the ICPMS measurements prove the stoichiometric composition of our sample and its uniformity within the high resolution of the methods used. Our conclusions derived from powder and single-crystal x-ray diffraction experiments are consistent with recent neutron powder-diffraction studies.[12] The slightly lower superconducting T_{c} of the latter work (T_{c}=16 K) is possibly due to the off-stoichiometry (slightly Fe-richer) composition of their samples.

Magnetic susceptibility and transport measurements were performed on single phase polycrystalline samples. The powder-diffraction pattern of the sample, as shown in Fig. 2, reveals at least 22 reflections that can be indexed to the P4/n mm space group. No impurity phase can be resolved. Electrical resistivity as a function of temperature \varrho(T) was measured using a standard four-probe method. The magnetic-field effect on \rho was determined using a quantum design physical property measurements system for temperatures down to 1.8 K and magnetic fields up to 7 T. The temperature dependence of the dc-magnetic susceptibility \chi(T) was measured using a quantum design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer at fields up to 5 T. Thermoelectric power was measured using a low-frequency (0.1 Hz) ac technique with a resolution of 0.02 \muV/K. During the measurements, the amplitude of the sinusoidal temperature modulation was kept constant at 0.25 K.

As shown in Fig. 3, LiFeAs exhibits bulk superconductivity as evidenced by a complete diamagnetic shielding signal with a superconductive transition at T_{c}=18 K. Resistivity measurements \varrho(T in Fig. 4 also show that LiFeAs is metallic with \varrho decreasing with temperature and features a markedly negative curvature. This negative curvature can be a consequence of strong electron-electron correlation, as in KFe_{2}As_{2}, or from strong electron-phonon interaction. The \varrho dramatically drops to almost zero below 18 K. A residual resistance observed below T_{c} is due to grain-boundary contributions.

The superconducting transition indicated by the \varrho(T) and \chi(T) plots are consistent with the thermoelectric power S(T) data in Fig. 5. The thermoelectric power, less sensitive to grain boundaries of polycrystalline samples, is zero below T_{c} within the resolution of the measurement. Also, the large negative thermoelectric power of LiFeAs indicates that its major carriers are electronlike (n-type), similar to the R(O/F)FeAs superconductors, and are in contrast to the holelike carriers in KFe_{2}As_{2} and (K/Sr)Fe_{2}As_{2}.[9] Furthermore, applied magnetic field was observed suppressing the transitions, as expected for superconducting compounds (inset of Fig. 4). The critical-field H vs T_{c} is shown in the inset of Fig. 3 with T_{c} defined at resistivity values corresponding to changes of 5%, 10%, 30%, and 50% in the total drop across T_{c}. Using the Ginzburg-Landau formula for the critical field, H_{c}(t)=H_{c}(0)\ast(1-t^{2})/(1+t^{2}) with t=T/T_{c}, a high zero-temperature critical field (H_{c2})>80 T can be extrapolated from the data derived from the 5% resistivity drop (Fig. 3).

LiFeAs is isoelectronic with AeFe_{2}As_{2} and LnOFeAs in that all have formal (Fe_{2}As_{2})^{2-} layers. In these three compounds, elemental Li-double layers, Sr or Ba layers, or (R_{2}O_{2}) slabs separate the charge carrying (Fe_{2}As_{2}) layers. This arrangement is similar to the Ae- or R-based layers that separate current carrying (CuO_{2}) layers in high-T_{c} cuprates.

  Furthermore, undoped parent phases of previously reported iron arsenides are not superconducting at ambient pressures but exhibit magnetic ordering. Spin-density wave transitions are observed in AeFe_{2}As_{2} (Ae=Sr and Ba) (Ref. [7]) and LaOFeAs.[1] It is therefore surprising that intrinsic LiFeAs does not appear to show a SDW but exhibits superconductivity with a respectable T_{c}=18 K. The superconducting behavior of LiFeAs can be roughly explained by assuming incomplete charge transfer from the strongly polarizing Li atoms to the electron-rich (Fe_{2}As_{2})^{2-} layers. However, this would lead to holelike behavior of the carriers, in conflict with the thermoelectric power data. The inconsistency may arise from changes in the conduction bands of the FeAs layers due to variations in interlayer distances. Detailed band-structure calculations as recently reported[13] could help in deepening the insight into the electronic structure and the Fermi surface to understand the complex properties of this class of compounds. High-pressure experiments and varying the electron counts on the (Fe_{2}As_{2})^{(2\cdot 2\cdot i)-} layers on the superconducting properties of LiFeAs by chemical doping may help unravel the puzzle. One may also infer that the character of charge carriers (electrons or holes) is related to the stacking arrangement of the (Fe_{2}As_{2}) layers. Proper explanation of the puzzling behavior of LiFeAs would significantly help elucidate the mechanism of high-T_{c} superconductivity in the layered iron pnictides, as well as the layered cuprates. The similarities between the layered FeAs superconductors and the layered cuprate superconductors have been pointed out previously by us and others. Thus, LiFeAs may be equivalent to the infinite layered member of the high-T_{c} cuprates.

In conclusion, a high-T_{c} Fe-based superconductor, LiFeAs, with a T_{c} of 18 K and a very high H_{c2} has been reported, and its structure unambiguously determined. Addition of LiFeAs to the list of structurally different yet isoelectronic FeAs superconductors provides further evidence to the important role of FeAs layers in this class of high-T_{c} materials. The electron nature of the carriers and superconductivity in undoped LiFeAs raise interesting questions that warrant detailed band-structure calculations and further experiments.

  Furthermore, the ICPMS measurements prove the stoichiometric composition of our sample and its uniformity within the high resolution of the methods used. Our conclusions derived from powder and single-crystal x-ray diffraction experiments are consistent with recent neutron powder-diffraction studies.[12] The slightly lower superconducting T_{c} of the latter work (T_{c}=16 K) is possibly due to the off-stoichiometry (slightly Fe-richer) composition of their samples.

Magnetic susceptibility and transport measurements were performed on single phase polycrystalline samples. The powder-diffraction pattern of the sample, as shown in Fig. 2, reveals at least 22 reflections that can be indexed to the P4/n mm space group. No impurity phase can be resolved. Electrical resistivity as a function of temperature \varrho(T) was measured using a standard four-probe method. The magnetic-field effect on \rho was determined using a quantum design physical property measurements system for temperatures down to 1.8 K and magnetic fields up to 7 T. The temperature dependence of the dc-magnetic susceptibility \chi(T) was measured using a quantum design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer at fields up to 5 T. Thermoelectric power was measured using a low-frequency (0.1 Hz) ac technique with a resolution of 0.02 \muV/K. During the measurements, the amplitude of the sinusoidal temperature modulation was kept constant at 0.25 K.

As shown in Fig. 3, LiFeAs exhibits bulk superconductivity as evidenced by a complete diamagnetic shielding signal with a superconductive transition at T_{c}=18 K. Resistivity measurements \varrho(T in Fig. 4 also show that LiFeAs is metallic with \varrho decreasing with temperature and features a markedly negative curvature. This negative curvature can be a consequence of strong electron-electron correlation, as in KFe_{2}As_{2}, or from strong electron-phonon interaction. The \varrho dramatically drops to almost zero below 18 K. A residual resistance observed below T_{c} is due to grain-boundary contributions.

The superconducting transition indicated by the \varrho(T) and \chi(T) plots are consistent with the thermoelectric power S(T) data in Fig. 5. The thermoelectric power, less sensitive to grain boundaries of polycrystalline samples, is zero below T_{c} within the resolution of the measurement. Also, the large negative thermoelectric power of LiFeAs indicates that its major carriers are electronlike (n-type), similar to the R(O/F)FeAs superconductors, and are in contrast to the holelike carriers in KFe_{2}As_{2} and (K/Sr)Fe_{2}As_{2}.[9] Furthermore, applied magnetic field was observed suppressing the transitions, as expected for superconducting compounds (inset of Fig. 4). The critical-field H vs T_{c} is shown in the inset of Fig. 3 with T_{c} defined at resistivity values corresponding to changes of 5%, 10%, 30%, and 50% in the total drop across T_{c}. Using the Ginzburg-Landau formula for the critical field, H_{c}(t)=H_{c}(0)\ast(1-t^{2})/(1+t^{2}) with t=T/T_{c}, a high zero-temperature critical field (H_{c2})>80 T can be extrapolated from the data derived from the 5% resistivity drop (Fig. 3).

LiFeAs is isoelectronic with AeFe_{2}As_{2} and LnOFeAs in that all have formal (Fe_{2}As_{2})^{2-} layers. In these three compounds, elemental Li-double layers, Sr or Ba layers, or (R_{2}O_{2}) slabs separate the charge carrying (Fe_{2}As_{2}) layers. This arrangement is similar to the Ae- or R-based layers that separate current carrying (CuO_{2}) layers in high-T_{c} cuprates.

  Furthermore, undoped parent phases of previously reported iron arsenides are not superconducting at ambient pressures but exhibit magnetic ordering. Spin-density wave transitions are observed in AeFe_{2}As_{2} (Ae=Sr and Ba) (Ref. [7]) and LaOFeAs.[1] It is therefore surprising that intrinsic LiFeAs does not appear to show a SDW but exhibits superconductivity with a respectable T_{c}=18 K. The superconducting behavior of LiFeAs can be roughly explained by assuming incomplete charge transfer from the strongly polarizing Li atoms to the electron-rich (Fe_{2}As_{2})^{2-} layers. However, this would lead to holelike behavior of the carriers, in conflict with the thermoelectric power data. The inconsistency may arise from changes in the conduction bands of the FeAs layers due to variations in interlayer distances. Detailed band-structure calculations as recently reported[13] could help in deepening the insight into the electronic structure and the Fermi surface to understand the complex properties of this class of compounds. High-pressure experiments and varying the electron counts on the (Fe_{2}As_{2})^{(2\cdot 2\cdot i)-} layers on the superconducting properties of LiFeAs by chemical doping may help unravel the puzzle. One may also infer that the character of charge carriers (electrons or holes) is related to the stacking arrangement of the (Fe_{2}As_{2}) layers. Proper explanation of the puzzling behavior of LiFeAs would significantly help elucidate the mechanism of high-T_{c} superconductivity in the layered iron pnictides, as well as the layered cuprates. The similarities between the layered FeAs superconductors and the layered cuprate superconductors have been pointed out previously by us and others. Thus, LiFeAs may be equivalent to the infinite layered member of the high-T_{c} cuprates.

In conclusion, a high-T_{c} Fe-based superconductor, LiFeAs, with a T_{c} of 18 K and a very high H_{c2} has been reported, and its structure unambiguously determined. Addition of LiFeAs to the list of structurally different yet isoelectronic FeAs superconductors provides further evidence to the important role of FeAs layers in this class of high-T_{c} materials. The electron nature of the carriers and superconductivity in undoped LiFeAs raise interesting questions that warrant detailed band-structure calculations and further experiments.
