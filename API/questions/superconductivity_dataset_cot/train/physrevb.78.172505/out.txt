###### Abstract

We present the microscopic properties of superconducting state in Mo_{3}Sb_{7} (T_{e}=2.2 K) using muon-spin rotation measurements. The zero-field-cooled and field-cooled (FC) data with an applied transverse field of 40 mT reveal an irreversibility in the muon relaxation rates and precessional frequencies below 2 K. We have also found an anomaly around 0.5 K, which may be related to a process of the vortex melting or some change in vortex-lattice symmetry. The temperature dependence of FC muon relaxation rate can be analyzed using a phenomenological double-gap s-wave model. The observation of a nonlinear field dependence of the muon relaxation rate is consistent with the occurrence of two superconducting gaps. Moreover, the magnetic penetration depth \lambda, coherence length \xi, superconducting carrier density n_{s}, and effective-mass enhancement m^{*} have been found to be \lambda\approx665 nm, \xi\approx12.5 nm, n_{s}\approx1.2\times10^{27} carriers/m^{3}, and m^{*}\approx18.7m_{e}, respectively.

The superconductivity in Mo_{3}Sb_{7} was discovered several years ago,^{1} but pairing mechanism in this compound is still under discussion. The conventional BCS-type mechanism was first proposed based on the magnetization data.^{1} On the other hand Dmitriev _et al._,^{2} using point-contact (PC) Andreev-reflection data, have suggested either a (s+g) wave or another unconventional mechanism. Furthermore, Candolfi _et al.^{3}_ have reported magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and electrical resistivity down to 0.6 K and have interpreted their data within the framework of the spin-fluctuation theory. Thus the mechanism of superconductivity and nature of pairing wave function in Mo_{3}Sb_{7} is an open debate. Therefore, recently we have also measured specific heat down to 0.4 K and in magnetic fields up to 2.5 T. Interestingly, our data hint the presence of two BCS-type gaps with 2\Delta(0)_{1}=4.0k_{B}T_{e} and 2\Delta(0)_{2}=2.5k_{B}T_{e}.^{4} The multigap scenario seems to be supported by field dependence of the Sommerfeld ratio C_{p}/T at 0.4 K, where one recognizes a nonlinear C_{p}(H)/T dependence. Since, the PC Andreev reflection and specific-heat measurements have not given pairing mechanism unambiguously, the precise technique, such as muon-spin rotation (\muSR) would be helpful in this matter. The muon-spin depolarization function which, in the case of a type-II superconductor, results from the distribution of local fields in the vortex state. This depolarization, or more precisely the Fourier transform, can provide unique and detailed insights into flux distribution and hence into the nature of the flux-line lattice, flux lattice melting, and flux pinning. The second moment of the internal field distribution in a type-II superconductor is a function of the penetration depth \lambda, the coherence length \xi, and the temperature dependence is a measure of the superconducting gap. Indeed, \muSR has been used to show the existence of multiple gaps in MgB_{2},^{5} La_{1.85}Sr_{0.17}CuO_{4}.^{6} La_{2}C_{3}, and Y_{2}C_{3}.^{7}

In this paper, we report on measurements of the muon-spin rotation for Mo_{3}Sb_{7} in the superconducting state. As we show below, different dynamics of motion of flux-line lattice in Mo_{3}Sb_{7} is clearly visible in the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) measurements. In addition to the irreversibility temperature (about 2 K for \mu_{0}H=40 mT), the temperature dependency of the muon depolarization rate and muon-spin precessional frequency exhibits an anomaly near 0.5 K, which can be interpreted due to a process of the vortex melting or some change in vortex-lattice symmetry. The most important result of our studies is also the observation of characteristic temperature dependence of the muon relaxation rate and its field dependence, being described by a phenomenological double-gap s-wave model. We also derive the superconducting carrier density 1.2\times10^{27} carriers/m^{3} and effective-mass enhancement of 18.7m_{e}. The obtained parameters, accompanied with high-temperature transition found at 50 K,^{8} could make Mo_{3}Sb_{7} to be a unique example of the bridge between two classes of multiple-transition superconductors: HTc and heavy-fermion ones.

Mo_{3}Sb_{7} was prepared from Mo and Sb powders (purity 99.95% from Alfa Aesar) by solid-state reaction. The procedure of the sample synthesis was described in detail in Ref. 9. Characterization by a scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry, and powder x-ray diffraction indicated that the investigated sample is high-quality single phase of correct stoichiometry. For \muSR measurements, pulverized sample of Mo_{3}Sb_{7} (5 g) was mixed with GE-7031 varnish and glued onto a high-purity silver (>4 N) holder of 30 mm diameter and 1 mm thick.

The \muSR measurements were carried out using MuSR spectrometer installed at ISIS facility of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (Chilton, U.K.). The measurements were performed in transverse field (TF) geometry with applied magnetic fields up to 50 mT and over the temperature range 0.1-2.5 K using ^{3}He-^{4}He dilution refrigerator. Each detector is normalized for the muon decay and rotated into real and imaginary components. These two spectra were simultaneously fitted with a sinusoidal oscillating function with the relaxation Gaussian component G_{z}(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{2}A_{i} exp(-\frac{\sigma_{i}^{2}t}{2})cos(2\pi\nu_{i}+\varphi_{i,\rm real,imag}), where the i-th component denotes the contribution from the superconducting and background phases, respectively, A_{i} is the initial asymmetry, \sigma_{i} is the Gaussian relaxation rate, \nu_{i} is the muon-spin precessional frequency, and \varphi_{i} is the phase offset. The background term comes from those muons which were implanted into the silver sample holder and therefore this oscillating term has no depolarization, i.e., \sigma_{2}=0.0\mus^{-1}. Typical TF \muSR spin precession signals in the superconducting state at applied field of 40 mT are shown in Fig. 1. One notices that \muSR measurements were also performed in longitudinal geometry. It appears that there was no change in the relaxations above and below the superconducting transition, thus, this may rule out triplet pairing.

Figure 2(a) shows the muon Gaussian depolarization rate \sigma(T) measured in a transverse field of 40 mT through two different modes: zero-field-cooled and sample field cooled from 2.5 K. The overall behavior of ZFC and FC \sigma(T) of Mo_{3}Sb_{7} resembles very much those of multigap superconductors La_{2}C_{3} and Y_{2}C_{3}, respectively.[7] For Mo_{3}Sb_{7}\sigma(T) above T_{c} is essentially independent of temperature and at 2.5 K amounts to 0.117 \mus^{-1}. The temperature independent \sigma(T) in the normal state is usually attributed the relaxation of static, on the time scale of the muon, nuclear moments. Below \sim2.2 K, significant increase in \sigma(T) in both FC and ZFC modes is observed. This temperature dependence of \sigma(T) shows the establishment of a flux-line lattice and indeed indicates a decrease of the magnetic penetration depth with decreasing temperature. Comparing of the ZFC and FC data reveals a substantial difference between these data. In the ZFC mode \sigma(T) increases with decreasing temperature faster than that of FC, thus points to difference in the numbers of the pinning sites and trapping energies, altered by magnetic fields and sample history. We may estimate the difference of the width of the local magnetic-field distribution at the muon sites \Delta W_{H} via the calculation of the difference \Delta W_{H}=(\sigma_{\rm ZFC}-\sigma_{\rm FC})/\gamma_{\mu}, where \gamma_{\mu}=135.5 MHz T^{-1}. The resulting \Delta W_{H} displayed in the inset of Fig. 2(a) suggests an unusual behavior of motion of flux vortices with changing temperature. From the \Delta W_{H}(T) dependence one detects the irreversibility temperature T_{it} of about 2 K, which is smaller than T_{c}. Interesting feature of the \Delta W_{H} data is the appearance of an upturn in \Delta W_{H} below T_{\rm vm}= 0.5 K. The behavior reflects a sudden rearrangement of flux vortices. Such enhanced \Delta W_{H} could be related to the presence of new trapping energy. A similar two-stage transition of the vortex in superconducting Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} had been observed by Blasius _et al.[10]_ The authors interpreted it as the intraplanar melting of the vortex structure into a liquid phase of flux lines.

The temperature dependence of the muon-spin precessional frequency \nu of Mo_{3}Sb_{7} at 40 mT is displayed in Fig. 2(b). In the normal state the value of the muon frequency is about 5.41 MHz, corresponding to a local field of 39.9 mT, practically the same value of the applied field strength. With decreasing temperature below T_{c} the frequency decreases as a result of the presence of flux lines. At 0.1 K, the \nu value in the ZFC mode amounts to 5.34 MHz, i.e., \sim39.4 mT. This means that only a small change in the internal field was experienced by muons, which may indicate a minor change

  in flux-line lattice. Inspection of Fig. 2(b) indicates a distinct effect of irreversibility as observed in the case of \sigma(T) data. We calculated the difference of the fields in the ZFC and FC measurements through the relation \Delta\mu_{0}H_{\rm loc}(n) (r_{\rm FC} - \nu_{\rm ZFC})/\gamma_{n} and have shown the temperature dependence of \Delta\mu_{0}H_{\rm loc}(T) in the inset of Fig. 2(b). The obtained \Delta\mu_{0}H_{\rm loc}(T) curve implies different dynamics of the flux vortices motions in the ZFC and FC modes. Again, we observe a steplike enhancement of \Delta\mu_{0}H below T_{\rm vm}\sim 0.5 K, indicative of the development of a sudden inhomogeneity of the local fields in the ZFC modes. The irreversibility temperature of 2 K is found also in \Delta\mu_{0}H_{\rm loc}(T) curve.

In order to study the mechanism of electron pairing in Mo_{3}Sb_{7} one must first estimate the relaxation rate associated with nonuniform field distribution of superconducting phase \sigma_{s}. We evaluated \sigma_{s} from the relation \sigma_{s} = \sqrt{\sigma^{2}-\sigma_{n}^{2}} (Fig. 3), where \sigma and \sigma_{n} are the relaxation rates obtained in the superconducting and normal states, respectively. To minimize flux pinning we used the relaxation rates in the FC measurements. In the flux-line lattice (FLL) state, \sigma_{s} in a conventional superconductor is expected to increase with decreasing temperature according to the empirical relation \sigma_{s}(T) = \sigma_{s}(0)[1 - (T/T_{c})^{\alpha}]. In the two-fluid model, the exponent n would take value of 4, [11] but in model of the ideal charged Bose gas n would amount to 3/2. [12] Using a value of \sigma_{s}(0) = 0.193 \mum^{-1}, we have calculated \sigma_{s}(T) and plotted as dotted and dashed-dotted lines in Fig. 3, respectively, for the two-fluid and Bose gas models. Clearly, the reproducibility of the data cannot be accepted.

Next, we have analyzed the \sigma(T) dependence using the approach [5]\sigma_{s}(T) = \sigma_{s}(0) - \delta\sigma(\Delta, T), where

\[\delta\sigma(\Delta,T) = \int_{0}^{\infty}f(\epsilon,T)[1 - f(\epsilon,T)]d\epsilon,\]

\[f(\epsilon,T) = \{1 + \exp\{\sqrt{\epsilon^{2} + \Delta(T)^{2}}/k_{B}T\}\}^{- 1},\]

k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant, and \Delta(T) is temperature dependence of the gap. Following Carrington and Manzano, [13] we used approximated formula \Delta(T) = \Delta(0)tanh[1.82*\{1.018*(T_{c}/T-1)\}] [51] with \Delta(0) being the isotropic superconducting gap at 0 T. In Fig. 3 we show theoretical curve (dashed line) obtained with 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} = 3.53. Apparently, the large difference between experimental and theoretical data provides no support to a conventional single gap s-wave BCS scenario. Finally, a satisfactory fit of the experimental data would be achieved in the fitting to a phenomenological two-gap model \sigma_{s}(T)=\sigma_{s}(0) - w\delta\sigma(\Delta_{1},T) - (1 - w) \delta\sigma(\Delta_{2},T). In fact, the model was proposed by Wang _et al._[14] and by Bouquet _et al._[15] some years ago for MgB_{2} and was applied for the specific-heat data of Mo_{3}Sb_{7}. [4] Following Bouquet _et al._, [15] the penetration gap below T_{c} can be considered as the sum of the contributions of two bands characterized by respective gap widths \Delta_{1}(T) and \Delta_{2}(T) and by relative weight w. The fitting result is shown in Fig. 3 as the solid line with 2\Delta(0)_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}=4.54, \Delta(0)_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}=2.73, and the weight w= 0.7. The obtained parameters are quite comparable with the specific-heat data. [4]

From the field dependence of muon relaxation rate we evaluated magnetic penetration depth \lambda, coherence length \xi, and upper critical field using the modified London equation [16]

\[\sigma_{s}(H) = \left(\frac{\gamma_{\mu}}{\sqrt{2}}\right)H\sum_{h,k}\left[\frac{ \exp(-\xi^{2}q_{h,k}^{2})}{\left[1+q_{h,k}^{2}\lambda^{2}/(1-H/H_{c2})^{2} \right]^{2}}\right]^{1/2},\]

where q_{h,k} is the lattice sum over the hexagonal FLL. We have fitted the values of \sigma_{s}(H) at 0.1 and 1 K as shown in the inset of Fig. 3. The best fit (see solid lines) gave \lambda =665(1) nm, \xi=12.5(9), and \mu_{0}H_{c2}=2.1 T for the data at 0.1 K, in good agreement with those from the specific-heat measurements of 660 nm, 12 nm, and 2.24 T. Assuming that the London penetration depth and coefficient of the electronic specific heat are related to the effective carrier mass m^{*} and the superconducting carrier density n_{s} as \lambda_{L}= (\varepsilon_{0}m^{<}c^{2}/n_{s}d^{2})^{1/2} and \gamma_{\pi}=\frac{\pi^{(3}\pi n_{s})^{1/3}k_{B}^{2}}{3\hbar^{2}}, and taking \lambda =665 nm and \gamma(0.4 K, 2 T)=42 mJ mol_{\rm fit}^{-1} K^{-2} one evaluates m^{*}= 18.7m_{e} and n_{s}= 1.19\times 10^{27} m^{-3}. It is necessary to caution that the magnetic penetration depth would be strongly modified by the presence of impurities and then the estimated m^{*} and n_{s} may include some large errors. For example, if 25% overestimation of \lambda_{L}, the effective mass and density of charge carriers could change to 16.2m_{e} and 1.84 \times 10^{27} m^{-3}, respectively. On the other hand, if taking the extrapolated to 0 K electronic heat coefficient \gamma_{0} = 34.5 mJ mol_{\rm fit}^{-1} K^{-2} ones gets m^{*}= 16.1m_{e} and n_{s}= 1.03 \times 10^{27} m^{-3}. In any case, the values of m^{*} and n_{s} observed in Mo_{3}Sb_{7} are comparable to those found in the filled skutterudite PrRu4Sb12 (m^{*}\sim10m_{e} and n_{s}\sim 4\times 10^{27} carriers/m^{3}). [17] The \sigma(H) data at 1 K show similar field dependence to those at 0.1 K, and the fit yields \lambda=704 nm, \xi=14 nm, and \mu_{0}H_{c2}=2.1 T. It is of interest to compare the nonlinear field dependence of \sigma_{s}, which was observed for numbers of superconductors, for instance, PrRu4Sb12, [17] NbSe2, YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.95}, and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C. [18] It may recall that NbSe_{2} is a double-gap superconductor. Thus, our experimental data of C_{p} and \muSR indicate that Mo_{3}Sb_{7} may belong to the family of multigapped compounds such as MgB_{2}, La_{1.83}Sr_{0.17}CuO_{4}, La_{2}C_{3}, and Y_{2}C_{3}. The recent calculation of electronic band

  structure[8] had suggested the Fermi surface to consist of four main bands, in which one distinguishes the heavier band formed by the 4d electrons of the Mo atoms and the lighter band composed by s or p electrons of the Sb atoms. Such large difference in the density of states and resulting in different Fermi velocities between these two bands probably leads to the formation of two superconducting gaps in these two parts of the Fermi surface.

In summary, we have carried out a transverse field muon-spin rotation experiment on the superconductor Mo_{3}Sb_{7} and have determined the muon depolarization rate and precession frequency in ZFC and FC modes. We found a large irreversible effect below irreversibility temperature, which results from the pinning of magnetic-flux vortices. We observed a sudden change in \sigma(T) and \nu(T) at about 0.5 K, probably due to a process of the vortex melting or to some change in the vortex-lattice symmetry. Further work on small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) would help in further understanding the nature of the phase transition near 0.5 K. From the temperature dependence of the muon-spin relaxation we estimated the magnetic penetration depth and coherence length. The \sigma_{s}(7) dependence is more consistent with the scenario of two distinct BCS-type superconducting gaps with 2\Delta(0)_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}=4.54 and \Delta(0)_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}=2.73. The field dependence of \sigma_{s}(H) provides strong support for this interpretation. The values of 2\Delta(0)_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}, \Delta(0)_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}, \lambda = 665 nm, and \xi=12.5 nm are in well agreement with those deduced from the specific-heat data. We also derived superconducting density and effective-mass enhancement to be 1.2\times 10^{27} carriers/m^{3} and 18.7m_{e}, respectively. The enhanced effective mass m^{*} and the reduced superconducting carrier n_{s}, together with the dimer spin gap transition reported previously,[8] could make Mo_{3}Sb_{7} to be an unique candidate of the bridge between two classes of the multiple-transition superconductors: HTc (m^{*}\sim 3m_{e} and n_{s}\sim 1\times 10^{28} carriers/m^{3}) and heavy-fermion (m^{*}\sim 100m_{e} and n_{s}\sim 1\times 10^{26} carriers/m^{3}) superconductors.

###### Abstract

We present the microscopic properties of superconducting state in Mo_{3}Sb_{7} (T_{e}=2.2 K) using muon-spin rotation measurements. The zero-field-cooled and field-cooled (FC) data with an applied transverse field of 40 mT reveal an irreversibility in the muon relaxation rates and precessional frequencies below 2 K. We have also found an anomaly around 0.5 K, which may be related to a process of the vortex melting or some change in vortex-lattice symmetry. The temperature dependence of FC muon relaxation rate can be analyzed using a phenomenological double-gap s-wave model. The observation of a nonlinear field dependence of the muon relaxation rate is consistent with the occurrence of two superconducting gaps. Moreover, the magnetic penetration depth \lambda, coherence length \xi, superconducting carrier density n_{s}, and effective-mass enhancement m^{*} have been found to be \lambda\approx665 nm, \xi\approx12.5 nm, n_{s}\approx1.2\times10^{27} carriers/m^{3}, and m^{*}\approx18.7m_{e}, respectively.

Therefore, recently we have also measured specific heat down to 0.4 K and in magnetic fields up to 2.5 T. Interestingly, our data hint the presence of two BCS-type gaps with 2\Delta(0)_{1}=4.0k_{B}T_{e} and 2\Delta(0)_{2}=2.5k_{B}T_{e}.^{4} The multigap scenario seems to be supported by field dependence of the Sommerfeld ratio C_{p}/T at 0.4 K, where one recognizes a nonlinear C_{p}(H)/T dependence. Since, the PC Andreev reflection and specific-heat measurements have not given pairing mechanism unambiguously, the precise technique, such as muon-spin rotation (\muSR) would be helpful in this matter. The muon-spin depolarization function which, in the case of a type-II superconductor, results from the distribution of local fields in the vortex state. This depolarization, or more precisely the Fourier transform, can provide unique and detailed insights into flux distribution and hence into the nature of the flux-line lattice, flux lattice melting, and flux pinning. The second moment of the internal field distribution in a type-II superconductor is a function of the penetration depth \lambda, the coherence length \xi, and the temperature dependence is a measure of the superconducting gap. Indeed, \muSR has been used to show the existence of multiple gaps in MgB_{2},^{5} La_{1.85}Sr_{0.17}CuO_{4}.^{6} La_{2}C_{3}, and Y_{2}C_{3}.^{7}

In this paper, we report on measurements of the muon-spin rotation for Mo_{3}Sb_{7} in the superconducting state. As we show below, different dynamics of motion of flux-line lattice in Mo_{3}Sb_{7} is clearly visible in the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) measurements. In addition to the irreversibility temperature (about 2 K for \mu_{0}H=40 mT), the temperature dependency of the muon depolarization rate and muon-spin precessional frequency exhibits an anomaly near 0.5 K, which can be interpreted due to a process of the vortex melting or some change in vortex-lattice symmetry. The most important result of our studies is also the observation of characteristic temperature dependence of the muon relaxation rate and its field dependence, being described by a phenomenological double-gap s-wave model. We also derive the superconducting carrier density 1.2\times10^{27} carriers/m^{3} and effective-mass enhancement of 18.7m_{e}. The obtained parameters, accompanied with high-temperature transition found at 50 K,^{8} could make Mo_{3}Sb_{7} to be a unique example of the bridge between two classes of multiple-transition superconductors: HTc and heavy-fermion ones.

Mo_{3}Sb_{7} was prepared from Mo and Sb powders (purity 99.95% from Alfa Aesar) by solid-state reaction. The procedure of the sample synthesis was described in detail in Ref. 9. Characterization by a scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry, and powder x-ray diffraction indicated that the investigated sample is high-quality single phase of correct stoichiometry. For \muSR measurements, pulverized sample of Mo_{3}Sb_{7} (5 g) was mixed with GE-7031 varnish and glued onto a high-purity silver (>4 N) holder of 30 mm diameter and 1 mm thick.

The \muSR measurements were carried out using MuSR spectrometer installed at ISIS facility of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (Chilton, U.K.). The measurements were performed in transverse field (TF) geometry with applied magnetic fields up to 50 mT and over the temperature range 0.1-2.5 K using ^{3}He-^{4}He dilution refrigerator. Each detector is normalized for the muon decay and rotated into real and imaginary components. These two spectra were simultaneously fitted with a sinusoidal oscillating function with the relaxation Gaussian component G_{z}(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{2}A_{i} exp(-\frac{\sigma_{i}^{2}t}{2})cos(2\pi\nu_{i}+\varphi_{i,\rm real,imag}), where the i-th component denotes the contribution from the superconducting and background phases, respectively, A_{i} is the initial asymmetry, \sigma_{i} is the Gaussian relaxation rate, \nu_{i} is the muon-spin precessional frequency, and \varphi_{i} is the phase offset. The background term comes from those muons which were implanted into the silver sample holder and therefore this oscillating term has no depolarization, i.e., \sigma_{2}=0.0\mus^{-1}. Typical TF \muSR spin precession signals in the superconducting state at applied field of 40 mT are shown in Fig. 1. One notices that \muSR measurements were also performed in longitudinal geometry. It appears that there was no change in the relaxations above and below the superconducting transition, thus, this may rule out triplet pairing.

Figure 2(a) shows the muon Gaussian depolarization rate \sigma(T) measured in a transverse field of 40 mT through two different modes: zero-field-cooled and sample field cooled from 2.5 K. The overall behavior of ZFC and FC \sigma(T) of Mo_{3}Sb_{7} resembles very much those of multigap superconductors La_{2}C_{3} and Y_{2}C_{3}, respectively.[7] For Mo_{3}Sb_{7}\sigma(T) above T_{c} is essentially independent of temperature and at 2.5 K amounts to 0.117 \mus^{-1}. The temperature independent \sigma(T) in the normal state is usually attributed the relaxation of static, on the time scale of the muon, nuclear moments. Below \sim2.2 K, significant increase in \sigma(T) in both FC and ZFC modes is observed. This temperature dependence of \sigma(T) shows the establishment of a flux-line lattice and indeed indicates a decrease of the magnetic penetration depth with decreasing temperature. Comparing of the ZFC and FC data reveals a substantial difference between these data. In the ZFC mode \sigma(T) increases with decreasing temperature faster than that of FC, thus points to difference in the numbers of the pinning sites and trapping energies, altered by magnetic fields and sample history. We may estimate the difference of the width of the local magnetic-field distribution at the muon sites \Delta W_{H} via the calculation of the difference \Delta W_{H}=(\sigma_{\rm ZFC}-\sigma_{\rm FC})/\gamma_{\mu}, where \gamma_{\mu}=135.5 MHz T^{-1}. The resulting \Delta W_{H} displayed in the inset of Fig. 2(a) suggests an unusual behavior of motion of flux vortices with changing temperature. From the \Delta W_{H}(T) dependence one detects the irreversibility temperature T_{it} of about 2 K, which is smaller than T_{c}. Interesting feature of the \Delta W_{H} data is the appearance of an upturn in \Delta W_{H} below T_{\rm vm}= 0.5 K. The behavior reflects a sudden rearrangement of flux vortices. Such enhanced \Delta W_{H} could be related to the presence of new trapping energy. A similar two-stage transition of the vortex in superconducting Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} had been observed by Blasius _et al.[10]_ The authors interpreted it as the intraplanar melting of the vortex structure into a liquid phase of flux lines.

The temperature dependence of the muon-spin precessional frequency \nu of Mo_{3}Sb_{7} at 40 mT is displayed in Fig. 2(b). In the normal state the value of the muon frequency is about 5.41 MHz, corresponding to a local field of 39.9 mT, practically the same value of the applied field strength. With decreasing temperature below T_{c} the frequency decreases as a result of the presence of flux lines. At 0.1 K, the \nu value in the ZFC mode amounts to 5.34 MHz, i.e., \sim39.4 mT. This means that only a small change in the internal field was experienced by muons, which may indicate a minor change

  in flux-line lattice. Inspection of Fig. 2(b) indicates a distinct effect of irreversibility as observed in the case of \sigma(T) data. We calculated the difference of the fields in the ZFC and FC measurements through the relation \Delta\mu_{0}H_{\rm loc}(n) (r_{\rm FC} - \nu_{\rm ZFC})/\gamma_{n} and have shown the temperature dependence of \Delta\mu_{0}H_{\rm loc}(T) in the inset of Fig. 2(b). The obtained \Delta\mu_{0}H_{\rm loc}(T) curve implies different dynamics of the flux vortices motions in the ZFC and FC modes. Again, we observe a steplike enhancement of \Delta\mu_{0}H below T_{\rm vm}\sim 0.5 K, indicative of the development of a sudden inhomogeneity of the local fields in the ZFC modes. The irreversibility temperature of 2 K is found also in \Delta\mu_{0}H_{\rm loc}(T) curve.

In order to study the mechanism of electron pairing in Mo_{3}Sb_{7} one must first estimate the relaxation rate associated with nonuniform field distribution of superconducting phase \sigma_{s}. We evaluated \sigma_{s} from the relation \sigma_{s} = \sqrt{\sigma^{2}-\sigma_{n}^{2}} (Fig. 3), where \sigma and \sigma_{n} are the relaxation rates obtained in the superconducting and normal states, respectively. To minimize flux pinning we used the relaxation rates in the FC measurements. In the flux-line lattice (FLL) state, \sigma_{s} in a conventional superconductor is expected to increase with decreasing temperature according to the empirical relation \sigma_{s}(T) = \sigma_{s}(0)[1 - (T/T_{c})^{\alpha}]. In the two-fluid model, the exponent n would take value of 4, [11] but in model of the ideal charged Bose gas n would amount to 3/2. [12] Using a value of \sigma_{s}(0) = 0.193 \mum^{-1}, we have calculated \sigma_{s}(T) and plotted as dotted and dashed-dotted lines in Fig. 3, respectively, for the two-fluid and Bose gas models. Clearly, the reproducibility of the data cannot be accepted.

Next, we have analyzed the \sigma(T) dependence using the approach [5]\sigma_{s}(T) = \sigma_{s}(0) - \delta\sigma(\Delta, T), where

\[\delta\sigma(\Delta,T) = \int_{0}^{\infty}f(\epsilon,T)[1 - f(\epsilon,T)]d\epsilon,\]

\[f(\epsilon,T) = \{1 + \exp\{\sqrt{\epsilon^{2} + \Delta(T)^{2}}/k_{B}T\}\}^{- 1},\]

k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant, and \Delta(T) is temperature dependence of the gap. Following Carrington and Manzano, [13] we used approximated formula \Delta(T) = \Delta(0)tanh[1.82*\{1.018*(T_{c}/T-1)\}] [51] with \Delta(0) being the isotropic superconducting gap at 0 T. In Fig. 3 we show theoretical curve (dashed line) obtained with 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} = 3.53. Apparently, the large difference between experimental and theoretical data provides no support to a conventional single gap s-wave BCS scenario. Finally, a satisfactory fit of the experimental data would be achieved in the fitting to a phenomenological two-gap model \sigma_{s}(T)=\sigma_{s}(0) - w\delta\sigma(\Delta_{1},T) - (1 - w) \delta\sigma(\Delta_{2},T). In fact, the model was proposed by Wang _et al._[14] and by Bouquet _et al._[15] some years ago for MgB_{2} and was applied for the specific-heat data of Mo_{3}Sb_{7}. [4] Following Bouquet _et al._, [15] the penetration gap below T_{c} can be considered as the sum of the contributions of two bands characterized by respective gap widths \Delta_{1}(T) and \Delta_{2}(T) and by relative weight w. The fitting result is shown in Fig. 3 as the solid line with 2\Delta(0)_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}=4.54, \Delta(0)_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}=2.73, and the weight w= 0.7. The obtained parameters are quite comparable with the specific-heat data. [4]

From the field dependence of muon relaxation rate we evaluated magnetic penetration depth \lambda, coherence length \xi, and upper critical field using the modified London equation [16]

\[\sigma_{s}(H) = \left(\frac{\gamma_{\mu}}{\sqrt{2}}\right)H\sum_{h,k}\left[\frac{ \exp(-\xi^{2}q_{h,k}^{2})}{\left[1+q_{h,k}^{2}\lambda^{2}/(1-H/H_{c2})^{2} \right]^{2}}\right]^{1/2},\]

where q_{h,k} is the lattice sum over the hexagonal FLL. We have fitted the values of \sigma_{s}(H) at 0.1 and 1 K as shown in the inset of Fig. 3. The best fit (see solid lines) gave \lambda =665(1) nm, \xi=12.5(9), and \mu_{0}H_{c2}=2.1 T for the data at 0.1 K, in good agreement with those from the specific-heat measurements of 660 nm, 12 nm, and 2.24 T. Assuming that the London penetration depth and coefficient of the electronic specific heat are related to the effective carrier mass m^{*} and the superconducting carrier density n_{s} as \lambda_{L}= (\varepsilon_{0}m^{<}c^{2}/n_{s}d^{2})^{1/2} and \gamma_{\pi}=\frac{\pi^{(3}\pi n_{s})^{1/3}k_{B}^{2}}{3\hbar^{2}}, and taking \lambda =665 nm and \gamma(0.4 K, 2 T)=42 mJ mol_{\rm fit}^{-1} K^{-2} one evaluates m^{*}= 18.7m_{e} and n_{s}= 1.19\times 10^{27} m^{-3}. It is necessary to caution that the magnetic penetration depth would be strongly modified by the presence of impurities and then the estimated m^{*} and n_{s} may include some large errors. For example, if 25% overestimation of \lambda_{L}, the effective mass and density of charge carriers could change to 16.2m_{e} and 1.84 \times 10^{27} m^{-3}, respectively. On the other hand, if taking the extrapolated to 0 K electronic heat coefficient \gamma_{0} = 34.5 mJ mol_{\rm fit}^{-1} K^{-2} ones gets m^{*}= 16.1m_{e} and n_{s}= 1.03 \times 10^{27} m^{-3}. In any case, the values of m^{*} and n_{s} observed in Mo_{3}Sb_{7} are comparable to those found in the filled skutterudite PrRu4Sb12 (m^{*}\sim10m_{e} and n_{s}\sim 4\times 10^{27} carriers/m^{3}). [17] The \sigma(H) data at 1 K show similar field dependence to those at 0.1 K, and the fit yields \lambda=704 nm, \xi=14 nm, and \mu_{0}H_{c2}=2.1 T. It is of interest to compare the nonlinear field dependence of \sigma_{s}, which was observed for numbers of superconductors, for instance, PrRu4Sb12, [17] NbSe2, YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.95}, and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C. [18] It may recall that NbSe_{2} is a double-gap superconductor. Thus, our experimental data of C_{p} and \muSR indicate that Mo_{3}Sb_{7} may belong to the family of multigapped compounds such as MgB_{2}, La_{1.83}Sr_{0.17}CuO_{4}, La_{2}C_{3}, and Y_{2}C_{3}. The recent calculation of electronic band

  structure[8] had suggested the Fermi surface to consist of four main bands, in which one distinguishes the heavier band formed by the 4d electrons of the Mo atoms and the lighter band composed by s or p electrons of the Sb atoms. Such large difference in the density of states and resulting in different Fermi velocities between these two bands probably leads to the formation of two superconducting gaps in these two parts of the Fermi surface.

In summary, we have carried out a transverse field muon-spin rotation experiment on the superconductor Mo_{3}Sb_{7} and have determined the muon depolarization rate and precession frequency in ZFC and FC modes. We found a large irreversible effect below irreversibility temperature, which results from the pinning of magnetic-flux vortices. We observed a sudden change in \sigma(T) and \nu(T) at about 0.5 K, probably due to a process of the vortex melting or to some change in the vortex-lattice symmetry. Further work on small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) would help in further understanding the nature of the phase transition near 0.5 K. From the temperature dependence of the muon-spin relaxation we estimated the magnetic penetration depth and coherence length. The \sigma_{s}(7) dependence is more consistent with the scenario of two distinct BCS-type superconducting gaps with 2\Delta(0)_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}=4.54 and \Delta(0)_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}=2.73. The field dependence of \sigma_{s}(H) provides strong support for this interpretation. The values of 2\Delta(0)_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}, \Delta(0)_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}, \lambda = 665 nm, and \xi=12.5 nm are in well agreement with those deduced from the specific-heat data. We also derived superconducting density and effective-mass enhancement to be 1.2\times 10^{27} carriers/m^{3} and 18.7m_{e}, respectively. The enhanced effective mass m^{*} and the reduced superconducting carrier n_{s}, together with the dimer spin gap transition reported previously,[8] could make Mo_{3}Sb_{7} to be an unique candidate of the bridge between two classes of the multiple-transition superconductors: HTc (m^{*}\sim 3m_{e} and n_{s}\sim 1\times 10^{28} carriers/m^{3}) and heavy-fermion (m^{*}\sim 100m_{e} and n_{s}\sim 1\times 10^{26} carriers/m^{3}) superconductors.
