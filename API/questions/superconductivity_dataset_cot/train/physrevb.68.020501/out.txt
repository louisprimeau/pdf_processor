###### Abstract

We report the magnetotransport properties of thin polycrystalline films of the recently discovered nonoxide perovskite superconductor MgCNi3. CNi3 precursor films were deposited onto sapphire substrates and subsequently exposed to Mg vapor at 700 degC. We report transition temperatures (_Tc_) and critical field values (H2) of MgCNi3 films ranging in thickness from 7.5 nm to 100 nm. Films thicker than ~40 nm have a _Tc_~8 K, and an upper critical field _H_c2(_T_ = 0) = 14 T, which are both comparable to that of polycrystalline powders. Hall measurements in the normal state give a carrier density, n = -4.2x102 cm-3, that is approximately 4 times that reported for bulk samples.

Over the last decade a broad and significant research effort has emerged aimed at identifying and characterizing relatively low-_Tc_ superconductors that are exotic in their normal state properties and/or order parameter symmetries. Examples include the ternary borocarbides LnNi2B2C, where Ln is a lanthanide element,1 the noncopper layered perovskite Sr2RuO4.2 and the superconducting titrate ferromagnets UGe2 (Ref. [3]) and ZrZn2.4 The recently discovered intermetallic MgCNi3 (Ref. [5]) falls into this class in that its major constituent Ni is ferromagnetic, generating speculation that the system may be near a ferromagnetic ground state.6 In addition, MgCNi3 is the only known nonoxide perovskite that superconductors, and is thus a compelling analog to the high-_Tc_ perovskites. Notwithstanding the widespread interest in MgCNi3, its status as a non-BCS superconductor remains controversial.7,8 Electron tunneling studies of the density of states in polycrystalline powders have yielded conflicting results as to whether or not MgCNi3 exhibits a BCS density of states.9,10 Tunneling into sintered powders is technically difficult, and indeed, a detailed quantitative characterization of MgCNi3 has, in part, been hampered by the fact that only polycrystalline powder samples have been available. Obviously, single crystal samples and/or polycrystalline films would be a welcome development both in terms of fundamental research and possible applications. In the present paper we present magnetotransport studies of thin MgCNi3 films. We show that the transition temperature of the films is only weakly dependent upon film thickness for thicknesses greater than 10 nm, and that both the transition temperature and critical field values of films with thicknesses greater than 40 nm are comparable to that of powder samples synthesized via standard solid state reaction processes.

The MgCNi3 films were grown by first depositing thin films of the metastable intermetallic CNi3 onto sapphire substrates by electron-beam evaporation of CNi3 targets. Typical deposition rates were ~0.1 nm/s in a 2 \muTorr vacuum. All of the evaporations were made at room temperature, and the resulting films were handled in air. The targets consisted of arcmelted buttons of high purity graphite (Johnson Matthey, 99.9999%) and nickel (Johnson Matthey, 99.9999%). The buttons were made with a starting stoichiometry of CNi3.25 to compensate for some loss of nickel during the melting process. The CNi3 structure of the pristine films was verified by x-ray diffraction.11 Scanning electron microscopy showed the CNi3 films to be very smooth with no discernible morphological features in 10 \mum\times10 \mum micrographs. The films were also quite adherent, and could not be pulled off with Scotch tape.

Footnote 11: The material is a material of the form (100) \mum, which is a material of the form (100) \mum, which is a material of the form (100) \mum.

MgCNi3 was synthesized by first sealing pristine CNi3 films in a quartz tube under vacuum with approximately 0.1 g of magnesium metal (Alfa Aesar, 99.98%). The tube was then placed in a furnace at 700 degC for 20 min, after which the entire tube was quenched-cooled to room temperature. X-ray powder diffraction analysis of the magnesiated films verified that MgCNi3 was formed. Intensity data were collected using a Bruker Advance D8 powder diffractometer at ambient temperature in the 2 \theta range between 20^{\circ} and 60^{\circ} at step width of 0.02^{\circ} and a 6 s count time. The inset of Fig. 1 shows the x-ray diffraction data for a 90 nm film on a sapphire substrate. The powder pattern shows that the film has good crystallinity and that it can be indexed according to the _Pm_ \overline{3}_m_ space group, with a = 0.38070(2) nm. The pattern also indicates that the films grew preferentially along the (_h_00) reflections. Electrical resistivity measurements were made by the standard four-probe ac technique at 27 Hz with an excitation current of 0.01 mA. Two-mil platinum wires were attached to the films with silver epoxy, and the measurements were performed in a 9-T Quantum Design PPMS system from 1.8-300 K.

In the main panel of Fig. 1 we plot the resistivity of a 7.5 and a 60 nm film as function of temperature in zero magnetic field. The thickness values refer to that of the CNi3 layers as determined by a quartz crystal deposition monitor. Subsequent profilometer measurements of the magnetised films did not show any significant increase in film thickness. We note that the resistance ratio, r290 k/_r_10 k~m~3 of the 60 nm film, is slightly better than that reported for pressed pellet samples.5,12 Indeed, the overall shape of the 60 nm curve is very similar to that of MgCNi3 powders, but the normal state resistivity \rho_{10\text{ K}}\approx20 \mu\Omegacm, is a factor of 2-6 _lower_ than polycrystalline powder values. The midpoint of the resistive transitions in Fig. 1 are 8.2 and 3.9 K for the 60 and 7.5 nm films, respectively. In Fig. 2 we plot the resistive transitions for a variety of film thicknesses d. Note that the transition temperature T_{c} is relatively insensitive to d down to about d= 15 nm, below which T_{c} is suppressed and broadened.

The perpendicular critical field behavior of a 60 nm film is shown in Fig. 3. As is the case with pressed pellets of MgCNi_{3} powder, the resistive critical field transition width is only weakly temperature dependent.[12] We defined the critical field, H_{c2}, as the midpoint of the transitions in Fig. 3, and in Fig. 4 we plot critical values as a function of temperature. The solid symbols represent a 60 nm film, and the open symbols are for a polycrystalline sample from Ref. [12]. Clearly the 60 nm critical field behavior is comparable to that of sintered MgCNi_{3} powders, which are known to have an anomalously high critical field and excellent flux pinning properties.[13] The zero temperature critical field can be estimated using the relation[14]H_{c2}(0)=-0.693(dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}}T_{c}. From the data in Fig. 4 we obtain (dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}}=-2.3 T/K, H_{c2}(0)= 12.8 T and a zero temperature coherence length \xi(0)\approx 5 nm.

We have also made Hall measurements of the films in the normal state between 10 K and room temperature. In the inset of Fig. 4 we show the Hall voltage as a function of

Figure 1: Resistivity of a 60 nm and a 7.5 nm MgCNi_{3} film as a function of temperature in zero magnetic field. The midpoint transition temperatures of the 60 nm and 7.5 nm films were T_{c}= 8.2 K and T_{c}= 3.9 K, respectively. Inset: X-ray powder diffraction pattern of a 90 nm MgCNi_{3} film on sapphire.

  magnetic field at 10 and 200 K. The solid lines are linear fits to the data. The slopes of the lines are proportional to the Hall coefficient R_{H}= 1/en, where n is the effective carrier density. Clearly the MgCNi_{3} films have electronlike carriers as is the case in the bulk material. However, the calculated carrier density at 10 K, n = -4.2\times10^{22} cm^{-3}, is about 4 times larger than that reported in Ref. [12] for sintered powder samples. It is somewhat surprising that the superconducting properties of the films are so similar to that of the bulk systems given the large enhancement in the density of states suggested by the Hall data.

Interestingly, recent studies of Ni-site substitution with Co, which in principle hole dopes the system, show a rapid quenching of the superconducting phase with increasing Co concentration,[15] even for concentrations as little as a few percent. Two possible explanations for this sensitivity to Co doping immediately come to mind. One is that Co behaves as a localized magnetic impurity and consequently produces pair breaking.[16] However, susceptibility measurements of MgCNi_{3-x}Co_{x} powders are not consistent with what would be expected for free Co moments. Furthermore, even at doping levels up to x=0.75 no long range magnetic order is seen.[15] A second possibility is that superconductivity in MgCNi_{3} is very sensitive to a narrow spectral feature in the electronic structure,[17] and that at even small Co doping levels the optimum band filling is compromised. Our Hall data, however, would suggest that this is not case and that T_{c} is not extraordinarily sensitive to the density of states. Presumably, the enhancement we observe in the Hall carrier density reflects a significant modification of bands near the Fermi surface that is a result of disorder or perhaps substrate-induced strain.

In conclusion, we report the first synthesis of MgCNi_{3} films and find that their transition temperatures and critical field behavior are very similar to that of bulk powder samples. The films are smooth, adherent, and show no significant air sensitivity. A thin film geometry lends itself quite well to planar counter-electrode tunnelling measurements of the electronic density states, thus providing a compelling alternative to scanning electron microscopy tunneling. Such a study in MgCNi_{3} films should prove invaluable in resolving the nature of the superconducting condensate. The film geometry will also allow access to the spin paramagnetic limit in parallel magnetic field studies, as well as possible electric field modulation of the carrier density via gating and critical current studies.
