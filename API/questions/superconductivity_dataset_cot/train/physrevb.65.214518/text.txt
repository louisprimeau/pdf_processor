###### Abstract

The magnetic properties and nanostructure of polycrystalline MgCNi3, prepared from a batch with overall composition MgC1.3Ni3, were studied by vibrating sample magnetometry and electron microscopy. Very high critical current density, e.g., 1.8 MA/cm\({}^{2}\) at 1 T and 4.2 K, is deduced from the magnetic hysteresis and evident subdivision of the sample into 10 \(\mu\)m clusters of MgCNi3 grains by excess graphite. The bulk pinning force \(F_{p}(H)\) is comparable to that of other strong flux-pinning superconductors, such as NbN, Nb-Ti, and Nb3Sn, all of which have higher critical temperatures. While \(F_{p}(H)\) indicates the expected grain-boundary pinning mechanism just below \(T_{c}\)  7.2 K, a systematic change to a core-pinning mechanism is indicated by a shift of the \(F_{p}(H)\) curve peak to higher (reduced) field with decreasing temperature. The lack of temperature scaling of \(F_{p}(H)\) suggests the presence of pinning sites at a nanometer scale inside the grains, which are smaller than the diameter of fluxon cores 2\(\xi(T)\) at high temperature and become effective when the coherence length \(\xi(T)\) approaches the nanostructural scale with decreasing temperature. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging and electron diffraction revealed a substantial volume fraction of cubic and graphite nanoprecipitates comparable to \(\xi(0)\)  5 nm in size, consistent with the hypothesis above. Dirty-limit behavior seen in previous studies may thus be tied to electron scattering by the precipitates. To our knowledge, no other fine-grained bulk intermetallic superconductor exhibits a similar change from grain boundary to core pinning with decreasing temperature, suggesting that the arrangement of pinning sites in MgCNi3 is unique. These results also indicate that strong flux pinning might be combined with a technologically useful upper critical field if variants of MgCNi3 with higher \(T_{c}\) can be found.

## I Introduction

The recent discovery[1] of superconductivity above 7 K in MgCNi3 suggests the possibility of a new family of nickel-carbide superconductors. MgCNi3 is related both structurally and chemically to the layered \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compounds (\(R\) =rare earth or Y), which exhibit superconductivity up to 17 K for LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C.[2] In particular, the three-dimensional cubic arrangement of Ni atoms in MgCNi3 is related to the two-dimensional square-planar arrangement of Ni in the \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C family. It has been proposed that, in analogy to copper and bismuth-oxide perovskites, the conduction in MgCNi3 involves holes in the Ni \(d\) states.[1] Such holes are usually responsible for magnetism rather than superconductivity. The possibility, therefore, of unconventional superconductivity has attracted great interest in the band structure and the physics of the pairing mechanism.[3, 4, 5, 6] From an application point of view, it is interesting that MgCNi3 behaves like a dirty-limit intermetallic superconductor, with a high resistivity and a steep slope of the upper critical field \(H_{c2}\) at the critical temperature \(T_{c}\).[7] This produces \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)\) values of 15 T,[7] comparable to the reported 8\(-\)15 T values for the layered, clean-limit borocarbide compounds[8] that have 2\(-\)3 times higher \(T_{c}\).

In this article, we present evidence for nanometer-scale precipitation in MgCNi3, which may explain why dirty-limit behavior is observed. Bulk pinning-force curves \(F_{p}(H)\) derived from magnetization data show a systematic change with decreasing temperature, from behavior characteristic of grain-boundary pinning near \(T_{c}\)  7.2 K to behavior characteristic of core pinning at 1.8 K. This implies the existence of intragranular pinning sites that are invisible to flux lines at high temperature, when the flux-line diameter 2\(\xi\) is large, but become effective at low temperature, when \(\xi(T)\) is slightly larger than \(\xi(0)\)  5 nm. Evidence for both graphite precipitates and an unidentified phase with cubic symmetry is provided by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both precipitates have 5 nm size, as deduced from moire fringe patterns. These nanoprecipitates probably result from the processing of MgCNi3, since excess carbon is needed to get the highest values of \(T_{c}\).[1] We are drawn to the interesting conclusion that MgCNi3 may be unique among high-field intermetallic superconductors, since it can be made with intragranular core-pinning sites that are necessary for strong pinning at high fields, a feature not found in, e.g., Nb3Sn, Nb3Ge, or NbN. Ni-based intermetallic superconductors might therefore be interesting for high-field magnet applications if new compounds with higher \(T_{c}\) can be found.

## II Experiment

A MgCNi3 pellet from a batch reported in Ref. [1] was studied, with nominal formula MgC1.5Ni3. Light microscopy of polished pieces cut from the pellet showed a dense, shiny phase with \(<\)5% porosity. Small regions of pure carbon (as graphite) were visible and indicated by x-ray analyses. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy, Fig. 1, show that the samples consist of random polycrystal colonies of MgCNi\({}_{3}\) ranging from 1 to 10 \(\mu\)m in size. Thin regions of carbon in the boundaries between colonies were common. TEM analyses at higher magnification reveal a finer grain structure inside each polycrystal colony, with size 100-300 nm. This grain size is typical of a polycrystalline intermetallic compound. Grain-boundary dislocations were evident along many grain boundaries, suggesting that a substantial number of grains have low angles of misorientation to each other within each colony.

Electromagnetic characterization was performed on a 3 mm\(\times\)3 mm\(\times\)0.5 mm prism, which was later thinned for the TEM analyses described above and in more detail later. A vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) was used to measure the sample moment \(m(H,T)\) from 1.8 to 330 K and in a field \(H\) from 0 to 14 T. In the superconducting state, raw hysteresis loops for 1.8 to 7.0 K, shown in Fig. 2(a), generally were symmetric around a weakly ferromagnetic background measured at 10 K, shown in Fig. 2(b). A slight bulge is evident at high field for the 1.8 K curve, whereas curves taken at higher temperatures do not have this feature. The hysteresis loops actually close slightly below the field at which the background magnetization of the normal state is reached, at the irreversibility field \(H\)*(\(T\)), as shown in Fig. 2(c). A small, reversible diamagnetic magnetic moment (relative to the 10 K background) was visible above \(H\)*, which changed slope to overlap the 10 K curve at the upper critical field \(H_{c2}(T)\). The uncertainty in \(\mu_{0}H\)*(\(T\)) is about 0.1 T, while that in \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(T)\) is about 0.3 T.

The saturation magnetization \(M_{sat}\) at 10 K is equivalent to the presence of 0.5% by volume of pure Ni impurities. By

(b) Transmission electron micrograph shows that the MgCNi\({}_{3}\) colonies are separated by a graphite layer. (c) Within each colony, MgCNi\({}_{3}\) grains are 100–300 nm in size.

(c) Magnified view of the magnetization loop closure at 4.2 K, showing how values for \(H\)* and \(H_{c2}\) were determined.

  measuring \(M_{t}\)(_T_) at ~50 K intervals, a magnetic transition temperature \(T_{m}\) of 390 K and a scaling of \(M_{t}\)(_T_) \(\propto\)(\(T_{m}\) - _T_)0.078 were determined. However, these values are significantly different from established values for pure nickel, \(T_{m}\) = 627.4 K and an exponent of 0.378.9 Since such a low level of Ni is difficult to quantify determine by x-ray diffraction (XRD) or microscopy, further study is needed to understand the ferromagnetic behavior.

The critical-field-temperature results, shown in Fig. 3, are similar to the recent results of Li _et al._7 Based on a linear fit of the 4.2-7 K data, we find a slope \(m\)0_dH_c_2/_dT_ of -2.3 T/K at \(T_{c}\) , which yields an extrapolated upper critical field at zero temperature, \(m\)0_H_c_2(0) = 0.697_c_dH_c_2/_dT_, of about 11.4 T using the \(T_{c}\) reported in Ref. [1] (7.2 K). Due to the fact that the inductive transitions were not sharp,1 a better estimate of \(m\)0_H_c_2(0) is 12.8 T, which includes our measured 11.4 T value at 1.8 K. This value for \(m\)0_H_c_2(0) is close to that reported in Ref. [7], 15 T. Based on our extrapolated _H_c_2(0) value, the coherence length at 0 K, _x_(0) = (2_p_m_0_H_c_2)1/2, is 5.0 nm. The difference between the irreversibility field, also shown in Fig. 3, and the upper critical field at 4.2 K is about 1 T, which is similar to that found in Nb 48 wt % Ti and less than that of Nb3Sn at 4.2 K.10

The critical current density \(J_{c}\)(_H_,_T_) was determined by applying standard critical-state expressions to the magnetization data.11 Assuming the current flows around the entire sample, the critical state of a thin square prism in perpendicular field applies, giving \(J_{c}\) = 3 D_M_/_d_, where D_M_ is the full width of the magnetization hysteresis and \(d\) = 3 mm is the width of the sample (SI units). From this evaluation, \(J_{c}\) is about 103-104 A/cm2 at 4.2 K. However, since the microstructural analyses (Fig. 1) show carbon between grain colonies, a more appropriate expression is the critical state of a sphere with diameter 2\(a\)  10 _m_m, giving \(J_{c}\) = 16D_M_/3_p_a_ = 1.8x106 A/cm2 at 1 T, 4.2 K. \(J_{c}\)(_H_) data are shown in Fig. 4. The bulk pinning force \(F_{p}\)(_H_) = \(m\)0_H_x_J_c_(_H_,_T_) derived from the \(J_{c}\)(_H_) data, shown in Fig. 5, reaches very high values under the latter assumption. For instance, the peak value at 4.2 K, 23.5 GN/m-3, is higher than that of optimized Nb 48 wt % Ti (Ref. [12]) at 4.2 K even though Nb 48 wt % Ti has a slightly higher irreversibility field at that temperature (_m_0_H_* \(\approx\) 10 T).

## III Discussion

In conventional superconductors, the flux-pinning mechanism associated with microstructural defects is often assessed by analyzing the shape of \(F_{p}(H)\) as a function of temperature. Reduced curves \(F_{p}(h,T)/F_{p\max}(h,T)\) plotted against a normalized field \(h\)=\(H\)/\(H\)*(\(T\)) typically overlap when a single pinning mechanism and pinning center is dominant,[13] and this behavior would be expected if, e.g., grain boundaries alone were the pinning centers. Such scaling behavior is commonly observed in intermetallic low-temperature superconductors such as Nb\({}_{3}\)Sn.[14, 15, 16] By contrast, a constant shape of the bulk pinning-force curve is not obeyed as a function of temperature in the present experiment, as shown in Fig. 6. Instead, a systematic shift of the reduced pinning-force curve peak toward higher field occurs as the temperature is reduced. This behavior strongly suggests that different pinning mechanisms and pinning centers are at work for temperatures near to and far below \(T_{c}\), respectively.

The nanostructural analyses in Fig. 1 suggest that grain boundaries within each polycrystalline colony and the carbon layers that separate colonies are two possible pinning centers. However, due to the large size of the colonies compared to the flux-line separation at high field, the carbon layers probably act as a surface barrier and contribute little to the overall pinning force above about 0.5 T.[17] It is also very unlikely that pinning by grain boundaries is the dominant pinning mechanism at 1.8 K, because the observed grain size of 100\(-\)300 nm is comparable to that seen in widely studied Nb\({}_{3}\)Sn composites, for which the peak of \(F_{p}(H)\) is rarely higher than \(h\) = 0.25.[15] Instead, the 1.8 K curve has the shape expected for core pinning by voids or precipitates at scales smaller than the resolution of Fig. 1.[12, 18] On the other hand, a grain-boundary pinning mechanism is consistent with the 6.5 K curve in Fig. 6.

The presence of a nanoscale system of pinning centers is revealed by high-resolution TEM imaging. Moire fringes dominate high-resolution images taken from the thinnest regions of the TEM sample, as shown in Fig. 7. Since moire fringes result when an electron beam transmitted through the main MgCNi\({}_{3}\) phase passes through another lattice with different atomic spacing,[19] the high-resolution images suggest that either impurities are present on the sample surface or small precipitates are embedded within the MgCNi\({}_{3}\) matrix. However, the ion-milling process used to prepare the TEM specimens makes the first possibility unlikely, so we are lead to conclude that moire fringes are caused by precipitates.

Further, since domains in the fringe patterns correspond to the projected cross section of individual precipitates, the precipitate quantity and dimensions can be inferred from the high-resolution images. For instance, many domains appear in Fig. 7 taken along the [301] MgCNi\({}_{3}\) zone axis, indicating a substantial volume fraction of precipitates. A large number of these domains have fringes that run generally from the upper left to the lower right of the main image, indicating that many precipitates share a common orientation with the selected MgCNi\({}_{3}\) zone axis (as discussed further later). Several of these domains appear to overlap, making it difficult to estimate the precipitate size. However, a few domains, indicated by arrows, show fringe patterns that run along the image vertical, due to larger misalignment of some precipitates with the zone axis. The size of the domains, about 5 nm, gives the approximate dimensions of the precipitates.

Selected-area diffraction patterns were acquired to iden

Arcs centered around the central electron beam (solid lines in the sketches below) are due to primary diffraction of graphite. Arcs centered around MgCNi\({}_{3}\) diffraction spots (dashed lines in the sketches) are due to double diffraction.

Arrows indicate moiré fringe domains caused by precipitates that are not aligned with the zone axis.

 tify the precipitate structure. Figure 8 shows selected-area diffraction patterns indicating graphite nanoprecipitates. The rectangular array of spots is produced by the MgCNi\({}_{3}\) for the indicated zone axes. Graphite is indicated by the weak arcs centered around the incident electron beam, where the arcs from the (101) and (015) planes (spacings of 0.208 nm and 0.146 nm, respectively) are brightest. Double diffraction produces arcs centered around the parent MgCNi\({}_{3}\) diffraction spots. The appearance of arcs rather than complete rings indicates that the graphite has some texture with respect to the MgCNi\({}_{3}\) lattice.

In addition to graphite nanoprecipitates, a second precipitate with cubic symmetry was identified. Diffraction patterns taken from various zone axes of the MgCNi\({}_{3}\) phase, shown in Fig. 9, have weaker secondary spots in addition to the primary spots from MgCNi\({}_{3}\). Some of the secondary spots can be indexed as primary diffraction from a cubic phase with larger lattice parameter, while the others can be attributed to double diffraction. For example, the diffraction pattern along the MgCNi\({}_{3}\)[100] zone axis and its corresponding indexing are shown in Fig. 9. In view of the diffraction pattern in Fig. 9 and those taken from several other zone axes, a lattice parameter of 0.47 nm can be determined for the cubic precipitate if the lattice parameter of MgCNi\({}_{3}\), \(d_{0}\) = 0.381 nm,1 is used as the reference. As a cross-check, it is interesting that the moire fringe spacing along the [100] zone axis \(d_{\text{mf}}\) is 1.96 nm, as indicated in Fig. 7, inset. From this spacing, a lattice parameter \(d_{1}\) = 0.47 nm can be obtained using the reciprocal relationship \(d_{\text{mf}}\) = \(d_{0}d_{1}(d_{1}-d_{0})^{-1}\). This lattice parameter agrees with the value obtained from diffraction above. When considered together, the diffraction patterns and the high-resolution images further suggest that the cubic nanoprecipitates have cube-on-cube texture with the MgCNi\({}_{3}\) matrix. The absence of any mismatch strain fields in the high-resolution images and the fact that the precipitate lattice parameter is 25% larger than that of the matrix also indicates there is close to a five-on-four commensuration between the two phases. This explains why the cubic precipitates are not prominent in lower-magnification images.

To explain the unusual flux-pinning behavior, we note that the plot in Fig. 6 is strikingly similar to the behavior of optimized Nb 48 wt % Ti strands.12 In that system, strong pinning is produced by a very fine two-phase nanostructure of 1 - 4 nm-thick \(\alpha\)-Ti precipitates separated by 5 - 10 nm in a matrix of superconducting Nb-Ti. Since the (nonsuperconducting) precipitate thickness is a bit smaller than the flux-line core diameter 2 \(\xi\)_m_ = 10 nm at 4.2 K and since there is a higher number of precipitates than flux lines, individual core-pinning interactions can be summed up directly to give a pinning-force curve with a peak at \(h\) \(\approx\) 0.5. However, since just below \(T_{c}\) = 9.1 K the fluxon core becomes much larger due to the divergence of \(\xi(T)\) \(\propto\) (1 - \(T/T_{c}\))\({}^{- 1/2}\), the individual nanometer-scale \(\alpha\)-Ti precipitates them become invisible to the flux lines and larger-scale precipitate clusters then become the pinning sites. This produces a pinning-force curve with a peak below \(h\) = 0.25 at 8.5 K. The lack of temperature scaling of \(F_{p}(H)\) for Nb-Ti thus results from the combination of having nonsuperconducting regions distributed on a scale less than \(\xi(0)\) and the diverging temperature dependence of \(\xi\) as \(T\) \(\rightarrow\) \(T_{c}\) .

In the present experiment, a similar distribution of precipitates that can act as pinning sites at length scales comparable to \(\xi(0)\) \(\sim\) 5 nm is present. Graphite is not a superconductor, which would give the necessary local suppression of superconductivity needed for flux pinning. Although we cannot identify the composition and exact structure of the cubic precipitates, band structure calculations3-5 suggest a strong sensitivity of superconductivity to the nickel atom bonds, including the possibility of ferromagnetic transitions. It is likely, therefore, that the cubic precipitates are also not superconducting. Moreover, while we cannot rule out a small level of excess pure nickel as the source of the ferromagnetic background, as discussed earlier, it is also possible that the cubic precipitates are ferromagnetic. As such, these would be especially potent pinning centers. We surmise, therefore, that the shift of the pinning force curve in Fig. 6 is the result of flux pinning by the nanoprecipitates at low temperature and its absence at \(T\) near \(T_{c}\) .

We do not believe collective pinning can account for this strong flux-pinning behavior. A clear signature of collective pinning in intergranular superconductors is the appearance of a peak effect near the irreversibility field, as described by Kes and Tsuei.21 This occurs when the critical current density is quite low. Adding pinning sites, e.g., by irradiation,22 results a crossover from this regime to the strong-pinning limit and the disappearance of the peak effect. Modern, optimized Nb\({}_{3}\)Sn conductors never display a peak effect and have critical current densities well beyond this limit and in excess of 105 A/mm2 at 12 T, 4.2 K.27 The magnetization current density of 106 A/cm2 is similar to the very high current densities found in Nb-Ti superconductors, which have \(T_{c}\) = 9 K

Figure 9: Selected area diffraction patterns from the [2T1], [301], and [100] MgCNi\({}_{3}\) zone axes. The sketch indicates primary diffraction spots from MgCNi\({}_{3}\) (○) and the cubic precipitate (•) , such as the (100) spots identified by arrows. Double-diffraction spots are also indicated (▴), for which primary diffraction beams from MgCNi\({}_{3}\) serves as incident beams for the precipitate. These double-diffraction spots are blurred by the overlapping primary spots.

  and \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)\)  16 T and obey direct summation.12 Based on the resistivity at \(T_{c}\)  [\(\rho\) = 120 \(\mu\Omega\) cm (Ref. 7)], the Sommerfeld coefficient of specific heat  [\(\gamma\) = 10 mJ (mol Ni)\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\)  (Ref. 1)] and the slope of \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(T)\) at the critical temperature given earlier, we estimate the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \(\kappa\) = 66 using the formalism of Ref. 20. This suggests that the pinning force per flux line \(J_{c}\) x \(\delta_{0}\) is of order 2 x 10\({}^{-5}\)   N/m, or about 10% of the flux-line tension \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{2}\)  \(\pi\xi^{2}/2\)  \(\kappa^{2}\xi^{\rho\omega}\) 1.5 x 10\({}^{-4}\)   N/m, where \(\phi_{0}\) = 2 x 10\({}^{-15}\) Wb is the flux quantum. This very strong pinning value lies well within the single-vortex pinning regime, where the flux-line lattice is plastically deformed.18,24
