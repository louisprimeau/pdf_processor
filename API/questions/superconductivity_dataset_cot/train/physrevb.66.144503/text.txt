###### Abstract

We performed measurements of magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and magnetoresistance in magnetic fields of up to 18 T in the magnetic superconductor RuGd1.4Ce0.6Sr2Cu2O10- \(d\) synthesized in oxygen pressures up to 95 atm. The magnetic-susceptibility data show the occurrence of an antiferromagnetic state below _T__N_~175 K, followed by the development of a weak ferromagnetic state near _T__M_~100 K, and followed further by the onset of superconductivity (SC) at _T__c_~42 K. The electrical resistivity as a function of temperature shows an evolution from nonmetal-to-SC behavior in samples prepared in a flux of O2 to a well defined metal-like behavior in samples prepared under 95 atm pressure of O2. The electron-phonon coupling constant was calculated from transport data to be _n__t_~0.17, a value comparable with other cuprates, indicating weak electron-phonon coupling in these methanes. The values of the upper critical field _H__c_2 for the O2 high-pressure treated samples were obtained from the magnetoresistivity data yielding _H__c_2(0)~39 T, and the out-of-plane superconducting coherence length _x_(0)~28 A. Based on the similarities between these ruthenates and the superconductor YBa2Cu3O7- \(d\), we estimated _H__c_2(0)~8 T and \(k_{s}\)(0)~140 A. We used these parameters to discuss the coexistence of long-range magnetic order and superconductivity on a microscopic scale on these materials.

D: 10.1103/PhysRevB.66.144503 144503 orientation domains, results of scanning tunneling spectroscopy in RuEu\({}_{1.5}\)Ce\({}_{0.5}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{10-\delta}\), combined with macroscopic measurements of magnetization and electrical resistivity, suggest that the SC and wFM are both bulk effects intrinsic to the phase.[3] A similar conclusion was also found for the Ru-1212 compounds from specific-heat[8] and magnetization data.[9] However, the magnetization data of the Ru-1222 phase reveal that the Ru sublattice generates an internal field of a few hundreds oersteds in the material below the magnetic ordering temperature \(T_{M}\).[3] Such an internal field, higher than the lower thermodynamic critical field \(H_{c1}\), was suggested to be responsible for the appearance of a spontaneous vortex phase in the compound.[10] Indeed, it has also been observed that such vortex configuration is preserved even under an external field as high as 50 Oe. This observation suggests that full Meissner response is difficult to be observed in these materials and that granularity effects, resulting from a mixture of SC and wFM phases, should be absent.[3]

In this work we describe our investigation of the superconducting RuGd\({}_{1.4}\)Ce\({}_{0.6}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{10-\delta}\) compound synthesized through a sol-gel route and annealed in oxygen pressures as high as 95 atm. Our measurements of magnetization, electrical resistance, and magnetoresistance in applied magnetic fields of 18 T enabled us to determine several parameters of this compound including the temperature dependence of \(H_{c2}\), \(H_{c2}(0)\), and estimates of the anisotropic superconducting coherence lengths of these ruthenates.

## II Experimental Procedure

Polycrystalline samples with nominal composition RuGd\({}_{1.4}\)Ce\({}_{0.6}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{10-\delta}\) (Ru-1222) were prepared by the sol-gel method.[11] The stoichiometric cationic nitrates and in the case of ruthenium, the chloride, were dissolved in distilled water using a magnetic stirrer. Upon complete dissolution, citric acid in twice the number of total cation moles was added to the solution followed by the same number of moles of ethylene glycol. The solution was then carefully concentrated to ~30% of its original volume, transferred to a ceramic crucible, and evaporated to dryness near 80 \({}^{\circ}\)C, after which the crucible was heated stepwise to 800 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The solid black powder residue was then ground, transferred to a ceramic boat, and subjected to two heat treatments in O\({}_{2}\) flow: (1) at 1000 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 12 h, followed by pelletizing; and (2) at 1050 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 20 h. Samples subjected to these heat treatments are termed the as-prepared ASP samples. A few pieces of the ASP sample were subjected to an additional heat treatment at 800 \({}^{\circ}\)C under O\({}_{2}\) pressure of 95 atm for 24 h. These samples are referred to as 95-atm samples. Finally, some parallelepiped bars of the 95-atm samples were subjected to the same heat treatment performed at 800 \({}^{\circ}\)C and under O\({}_{2}\) pressure of 95 atm for an additional 24 h. These samples are referred to as 95-atm-2\(X\). Further details of the apparatus used for preparing samples under high O\({}_{2}\) pressure can be found elsewhere.[12] The phases were identified by means of powder x-ray diffractometry (XRD) using Cu \(K\alpha\) radiation on a Bruker D8 advanced diffractometer. The lattice parameters were obtained from the corrected peak positions, using MgO as an internal standard. The XRD spectra for all samples could be indexed according to a tetragonal structure with space group \(I4/mmm\) and lattice parameters \(a\) = 3.835 \(\pm\) 0.005 A and \(c\) = 28.56 \(\pm\) 0.04 A, in agreement with previous data.[12] Magnetic-susceptibility measurements were made utilizing a quantum design squid magnetometer. Zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) curves were obtained from 5 to 300 K in applied magnetic fields of 7 T. Four-wire electrical resistance measurements, in the temperature range 2 \(\leq\) \(T\)\(\leq\) 300 K, at 18 T, were performed at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory--Los Alamos Facility utilizing a commercial Linear Research (Model LR-700) ac resistance bridge operating at a frequency of 16 Hz. For these measurements, copper electrical leads were attached to Ag film contact pads on parallelepiped-shaped samples using Ag epoxy.

## III Results and Discussion

The ZFC and FC magnetic-susceptibility (\(\chi\)) data at \(H\) = 50 Oe as a function of temperature, for the as-prepared and high O\({}_{2}\) pressure treated samples are shown in Fig. 1. These specimens were all derived from the same original batch of the material. The \(\chi\) vs \(T\) data show both the onset of wFM near \(T_{M}\)\(\sim\) 100 K and the onset of SC at \(T_{c}\)\(\sim\) 30 K. The value of \(T_{M}\) is \(\sim\) 7 K higher for the ASP specimen, while \(\chi\) vs \(T\) curves for the 95-atm and 95-atm-2\(X\) samples are similar down to about 70 K. Below this temperature, the ZFC and FC branches for the three samples split. The ZFC \(\chi\) vs \(T\) data below 30 K show a diamagnetic contribution due to SC, which is absent in the FC data. It is worth mentioning that the diamagnetic signal in the ZFC data is offset by the positive contribution of the wFM to \(\chi\). The ZFC and the FC data between \(T_{c}\) and \(T_{M}\) are quite different, and a detailed study of this region is in progress. The shape of the curves below \(T_{c}\) is similar for the three samples. The values of \(\chi\) for the ASP sample are slightly higher than the values for the high O\({}_{2}\) pressure treated samples by about 70 emu/g Oe, which is

Both ZFC and FC data were taken. The inset shows the anomalies at \(\sim\)175 K, which can be associated with the onset of antiferromagnetic ordering within the RuO\({}_{2}\) planes.

  essentially the value of the difference in _kh_ of the FC values. The wFM phase originates from an ordered antiferromagnetic state, which develops below _T__N_~175 K.3 The onset of the AF order is accompanied by subtle changes in _kh_ vs \(T\), as indicated in the inset of Fig. 1.

In order to explore further the features observed in the magnetic-susceptibility data, we performed measurements of electrical resistivity as a function of temperature in the same samples of Fig. 1. The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity _r_(_T_) for the specimens with the three different treatments is shown in Fig. 2. The _r_(_T_) data indicate two important features as the sample is heat treated under high pressure of O2: (1) an evolution from nonmetallic to metallic behavior; and (2) an appreciable decrease in the magnitude of _r_(_T_). The changes driven by oxygen treatment are mirrored in the magnitude of _r_(_T_ = 300 K), which decreases from ~600 mO mm cm for the ASP sample to ~130 mO mm cm for the 95-atm specimen. Ultimately, _r_(_T_ = 300 K) reaches a value as low as ~7 mO cm for the 95-atm-2\(X\) sample. The value of _r_(_T_) at 80 K of ca. 3.5 mO cm for the latter is nearly twice as small as that by Chen and co-authors,13 namely, ca. 6 mO mm found in compounds with the same stoichiometry but subjected to heat treatments under 50 atm of O2.

Changes in the onset of superconductivity are also observed in our samples with \(T_{c}\) assuming values near 18 K, 42 K, and 42 K for ASP, 95 atm, and 95-atm-2\(X\), respectively. It is clearly seen that the transitions take place over a wide temperature range. Such a broad superconducting transition width, as large as 15 K, is frequently observed not only in these Ru-based compounds but also in both Nb and Ta isomorphic materials.1,2 It has been argued that broad transition widths would be mainly associated with cation disorder.1 This is an important point because one could speculate that larger transition widths could be related to the competition between SC and wFM. However, larger transition widths have been also observed in Nb- and Ta-based compounds which are not magnetic, supporting the conjecture that the broad transitions are intrinsic to compounds with cation disorder.

The evolution of nonmetallic to metallic behavior as the samples are treated in higher O2 pressure for a longer time is accompanied by: (1) a progressive increase of the slope _d_r_(_T_)/_dT_; and 2) a sharper transitions to the SC state, both of which can be associated with a reduction of the cation disorder upon oxygenation. The oxygenation process ultimately produces a metal-like material in which _r_(_T_) = \(r\)0 + _AT_, as for example in the sample 95-atm-2\(X\) above \(T_{c}\), where \(r\)0 = 2.2 mO cm and \(A\) = 1.72x10-5 O cm K-1. Assuming that the linear dependence on \(T\) is caused by electron-phonon (_e_-_p_) scattering, the _e_-_p_ coupling constant \(l_{r}\) can be estimated from the slope \(A\) by utilizing the expression14

\[\lambda_{tr} = \frac{\hbar\,\omega_{p}^{2}}{8\,\pi^{2}k_{B}}\frac{\rho(T) - \rho_{0}}{T} = \frac{\hbar\,\omega_{p}^{2}}{8\,\pi^{2}k_{B}}A,\]

where \(k_{B}\) is the Boltzmann constant, \(\hbar\,\omega_{p}\) is the plasma energy expressed in eV, and \(A\) is expressed in _mO_ cm K-1.

Assuming that the London penetration depth \(l_{L}\) of our samples is ca. 1 _m_m,9,15 similar to that obtained for Ru-1212 compounds, the plasma frequency can then be calculated from \(o_{p}\) = _c_/_l__L_, where \(c\) is the speed of light, yielding \(\hbar\,\omega_{p}\)~0.2 eV, in excellent agreement with values of \(\hbar\,\omega_{p}\) found in several cuprates.14 We are now ready to determine \(l_{r}\) from the linearity of our _r_(_T_) data for the 95-atm-2\(X\) sample by using Eq. (1). The result is _l__tr_~0.17. This value of \(l_{r}\) is close to the values 0.1 and 0.3 calculated for La1.85F0.15CuO4-_d_  (LSCO) and YBa2Cu3O7-_d_, respectively,14 and it suggests that the electron-phonon coupling in the Ru-based compounds is weak. The value of \(l_{r}\) should be similar for the samples with the other two heat treatments as well. However, our analysis cannot be extended to the samples that do not show a linear behavior of \(r\) vs \(T\).

Back to the 95-atm-2\(X\) sample, the _r_(_T_) data do not exhibit any sign of saturation up to 300 K, as shown in Fig. 2, suggesting that the mean free path \(l\) is much longer than the interatomic spacing within the unit cell below this temperature. An estimate of the lower limit of the mean free path \(l\) at temperatures in which _r_(_T_) is linear in temperature can be obtained from the expression [Ref. 14]

\[l = \frac{4.95\times 10^{- 4}\upsilon_{F}}{(\hbar\,\omega_{p})^{2}\rho},\]

where \(v_{F}\) is the Fermi velocity, assumed here to be 2.5 x107 cm/s,16,17 and \(r\) is given in _mO_ cm. The value of \(l\) at 300 K from Eq. (2) was found to be ~58 A, which is over 30 times larger then the typical Cu-O bond length of ~1.9 A in these materials. This estimate of \(l\) (300 K) is also similar to the one of ~56 A found in LSCO and comparable to other high-_T__c_ cuprates.14 In light of the evolution of \(r\) vs \(T\), from being almost temperature independent above \(T_{M}\) for the 95-atm sample, to developing a metal-like slope for the 95-atm-2\(X\) sample, we have also estimated \(l\) at 300 K by using Eq. (2) for the sample at 95 atm. Our estimate of \(l\) ~3 A strongly suggests that the mean free path at high temperatures is comparable to either the typical Cu-O bond

  length (~1.9 A) or the in-plane lattice parameter \(a\) ~3.8 A. This result has indicated that the saturation of \(r\) vs \(T\) occurs when \(l\)  \(a\), a feature observed in the 95-atm sample, as shown in Fig. 2. Thus, combining the resulting estimates of \(l\) from the linearity of \(r\) vs \(T\) curves, we infer that increasing O2 pressure results in a significant increase of \(l\) in this series. This is consistent with a systematic decrease of the cation disorder upon oxygenation, but also with an increasing volume fraction of the metallic phase. Finally, a careful inspection of the data in Fig. 2 for both high-pressure annealed samples also indicates a slight drop in _r_(_T_) just below \(T_{M}\) (~100 K), which is probably due to the suppression of the spin-flip scattering below the onset of wFM ordering.

In order to probe the effect of the magnetic field on the superconducting properties of these Ru compounds, we carried out magnetoresistivity measurements in fields up to 18 T. We shall start this discussion by describing the behavior of the curves of _r_(_T_) in magnetic fields taken in the 95-atm-2\(X\) sample, as shown in Fig. 3. It is important to notice that the foot that develops as \(r\) approaches zero, when \(H\) = 0 T, can be due to the remnant field of the superconducting magnet, which is not homogeneous and of the order of 0.01 T in our instrumentation. This kind of behavior is frequently observed in granular superconductors and can account for the broadening of the SC transition at low \(H\) and close to the zero-resistance state.[18] In addition, as shown by Tokunaga and co-authors,[5] it is possible that the broadening of the SC transition could be due to the presence and motion of self-induced vortices. They found that a broad resistive transition in RuSr\({}_{2}\)YCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\), a material with no magnetic rare-earth ions, was correlated with the occurrence of the development of a spontaneous moment within RuO2 planes.

Increasing field results in appreciable changes in the shape of the _r_(_T_) curves in the superconducting state. As the magnetic field increases, the superconducting transition becomes broader near the onset of SC, and sharper near the zero resistance state, as observed in other granular cuprates.[19] It is important to notice that the zero-resistance state is preserved below 6 K even for the highest magnetic field of 18 T used in this experiment, which attests for the high quality of the high O2 pressure material obtained.

As an approach to determine the _H_c2 vs \(T\) phase diagram, electrical resistivity measurements at constant applied magnetic fields were performed. In Fig. 3, a collection of such data is presented. We fully understand that due to the wide fluctuation regime below \(T_{c}\), this approach only represents the upper limit in determining _H_c2 values. With this in consideration, we assumed the same onset of SC for all fields (~42 K) and extracted (_H_c2,_T_) pairs from the 50% drops in electrical resistance. The results are displayed in Fig. 4 for the 95-atm-2\(X\) sample. At high magnetic fields, the upper-critical-field phase diagram of Fig. 4 shows a linear increase of _H_c2. This behavior can be attributed to the progressive narrowing of the resistive transition (see data of Fig. 3), which tends to increase _T_c(_H_). The slope of the upper critical field at high fields was found to be - 1.13 T/K. At lower fields, the resistive data exhibit an upward curvature developing from a linear slope of - 0.38 T/K near _T_c~36 K. This positive curvature is reminiscent of other cuprates (Ref. [20]), albeit inconsistent with the linear behavior of _H_c2 expected for both Ginzburg-Landau and BCS theories close to \(T_{c}\). The orbital critical field extrapolated to \(T\) = 0 K from the linear slope at high fields can be estimated by using the Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg[21] (WHH) formula _H_c2(0) = - 0.7(_dH_c2/_dT_)\(T_{c}\), with _dH_c2/_dT_ = - 1.13 and \(T_{c}\) = 39 K, yielding _H_c2(0)~31 T. The same procedure applied to the slope at low fields yields to _H_c2(0)~9.6 T. However, previous analysis in several cuprates have not shown the concave downward behavior that is expected in _H_c2 on the basis of the WHH formalism. Therefore, an extrapolation from the fitting procedure of the _H_c2 vs \(T\) data to the phenomenological relation _H_c2(_T_) = _H_c2(0)[ - (_T_/_T__c_)2]a is more appropriate and consistent with the Ginzburg-Landau theory.[22] By doing this, we have obtained _T_c~39 K, \(a\) = 1.8 +- 0.2, and _H_c2(0)~39 T. Values of \(a\), in the 1.5-2.0 range, are frequently observed in other high-_T__c_ materials.[22] Also, this magnitude of _H_c2(0)~39 T is slightly higher than that obtained via the WHH formalism but in line with the values for other high-_T__c_ materials with similar _T__c_'s.[22] According to the relation _H_c2(0) = Ph0/2 _p_%02, where Ph0 is the quantum of magnetic flux and _H_c2(0)~39 T, this corresponds to a superconducting coherence length \(x\)0

The dashed line corresponds to a fit to the phenomenological relation _H_c2(_T_) = _H_c2(0)[ 1 - (_T_/_T__c_)2]a. The high- and low-field slopes _dH_c2/_dT_ are also shown in solid lines.

  \(\sim\)28 A, which is one order of magnitude larger than the typical Cu-O bond length and comparable to the \(c\)-axis lattice parameter of these Ru compounds.

In light of the anisotropic nature of this magnetic superconductor and the high-field procedure to estimate \(\xi_{0}\), it is reasonable to expect that the value of \(H_{c2}\) reflects the upper critical field parallel to the \(a\)-\(b\) plane. By assuming the relationship between \(H_{c2}\) and \(\xi\) for anisotropic superconductors \(H_{c2}^{ab}(T) = \Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi_{c}^{2}(T)\), we find \(\xi_{c}(0) \sim 28\) A, which reflects mainly the CuO\({}_{2}\) out-of-plane superconducting coherence length. Such a superconducting coherence length along the \(c\) direction is found to be four times the value of \(\xi_{c}(0) \sim 7\) A for La\({}_{1.85}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)CuO\({}_{4 - \delta}\) with a \(T_{c}\) of \(\sim 38\) K (Ref. [22]) and about eight times larger than that of \(\xi_{c}(0) \sim 3.4\) A for the electron-doped compound Nd\({}_{1.85}\)Ce\({}_{0.15}\)CuO\({}_{4 - \delta}\) with \(T_{c}\)\(\sim 25\) K. [23] Once we have obtained \(\xi_{c}(0) \sim 28\) A for the RuGd\({}_{1.4}\)Ce\({}_{0.6}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{10 - \delta}\) compound, it is tempting to estimate the in-plane coherence length \(\xi_{ab}(0)\). Let us assume that the anisotropy factor \(\gamma\) (\(=H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^{c} = \xi_{ab}/\xi_{c}\)) of Ru-based compounds has an upper limit given by ca. 5 of the YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7 - \delta}\) compound. In fact, it is expected that the RuGd\({}_{1.4}\)Ce\({}_{0.6}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{10 - \delta}\) compound would have anisotropy slightly smaller than 5, as suggested elsewhere. [1, 2] Thus, assuming \(\gamma\)\(=H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^{c} \sim 5\), one finds \(H_{c2}^{c}(0) \sim 8\) T and \(\xi_{ab}(0) \sim 140\) A. The estimated value of \(H_{c2}^{c}(0)\) is comparable to the \(\sim 9.6\)-T value found from the slope of the (\(dH_{c2}/dT\)) behavior at lower magnetic fields, thus lending credence to the assumptions made in our analysis. The estimated in-plane coherence length of \(\xi_{ab}(0) \sim 140\) A corresponds to over 30 times the spacing between adjacent conducting CuO\({}_{2}\) planes.

The value of \(\xi_{ab}(0) \sim 140\) A is important for the discussion involving the microscopic scale in which the SC and the wFM can coexist in these ruthenates. [7, 15, 24] The results of HRTEM in Ru-1212 of Ref. [7] indicated two different regions or domains with typical dimensions 50\(\leq\)\(a\)\(\leq\) 200 A in which different orientations of the RuO\({}_{6}\) octahedra are observed. In principle, these two regions may be related to two different phases within grains: one superconducting and another one nonsuperconducting and magnetic, suggesting an intimate mixture of both phases. Thus, assuming that our estimate of \(\xi_{ab}(0) \sim 140\) A is related to the superconducting phase, this result indicates that superconductivity is limited spatially in a length scale similar to \(d\). Such a coexistence of SC and wFM phases in a submicron length scale resembles the behavior of granular superconductors, and is consistent with several experimental results of these Ru-based compounds. [6, 24, 25] On the other hand, recent magnetization measurements in Ru-1222 indicated that at least two magnetic phases coexist within grains of polycrystalline samples, suggesting a phase separation in these compounds. [24] Indeed, it was argued that both phases manifest themselves in a submicron length scale, and would coexist with a superconducting phase. Again, our estimate of \(\xi_{ab}(0) \sim 140\) A provides a natural length scale for such a coexistence.

Concluding, we have prepared high-quality samples of the magnetic superconductor RuGd\({}_{1.4}\)Ce\({}_{0.6}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{10 - \delta}\) through a sol-gel precursor route. The samples with best superconducting and normal-state properties were heat treated under O\({}_{2}\) pressure of 95 atm. The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility showed the development of an antiferromagnetic ordering of the Ru sublattice at \(T_{N}\sim 175\) K, which is followed by the onset of weak ferromagnetism near \(T_{M}\sim 100\) K. Further decrease in temperature revealed the onset of superconductivity at \(T_{c}\sim 42\) K. Measurements of the electrical resistivity as a function of temperature demonstrate the importance of the heat treatment in high pressure of O\({}_{2}\) upon the macroscopic properties of these compounds. From the temperature dependence of magnetoresistivity data, we have estimated the upper limit of the upper critical field along the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes \(H_{c2}^{ab}(0) \sim 39\) T and the out-of-plane coherence length \(\xi_{c}(0) \sim 28\) A. Based on the crystallographic similarities between these Ru-based compounds and the superconductor YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7 - \delta}\), we estimated \(H_{c2}^{c}(0)\sim 8\) T and \(\xi_{ab}(0) \sim 140\) A. From these values we were able to discuss the length scale over which superconductivity and magnetism can coexist in these Ru-based compounds.
