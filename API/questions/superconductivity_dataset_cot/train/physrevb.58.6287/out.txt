###### Abstract

We have synthesized and characterized YbFe4Sb12, a member of the class of filled skutterudite (LaFe4P12+type) compounds. Measurements of the lattice parameter, magnetization, electrical resistivity, and specific heat suggest that the Yb ions have an intermediate valence and that the effective mass of the conduction electrons is moderately enhanced at low temperatures. The coefficient of the electronic specific heat is estimated to be \gamma(0) = 140 mJ mol-1 K-2, and we observe a characteristic temperature for the Yb ion valence fluctuations of T^{*} \sim 50 K. No superconductivity was detected down to T = 0.40 K. [S0163-1829(98)03733-3]

## 1 Introduction

The family of compounds known as the filled skutterudites [1] (space group _In_3), with the general structural formula MT_{4}X_{12} (_M_ = alkaline earth, rare earth, actinide; T = Fe, Ru, Os; X = pnictogen: P, As, Sb) exhibits a striking variety of physical properties that are associated in large part with the unusual behavior of the M atoms. Insulating behavior can arise due to an energy gap formed by hybridization of the M atom f level with a broad band of the T4_X_12 sublattice. [2] Superconductivity, [3, 4, 5] ferromagnetism, [2] and a metal-insulator transition [6] have also been observed among various members of the filled skutterudites. Recent work has shown that CeFe4Sb12 exhibits heavy-fermion behavior with moderately high electron effective masses, [7, 8, 9] which motivated us to search for similar correlated electron effects in other filled skutterudite compounds. Elements that are known to exhibit such physics in intermetallic compounds include Ce, Pr, Sm, Eu, Tm, Yb, and U, i.e., those which are generally close to an _f_-electron valence instability. There are many models for this subtle electronic state that are neither localized nor truly itinerant, but a common feature is the existence of a characteristic energy scale _k_B_T_* that delineates high-temperature magnetic (Curie law) behavior from low-temperature nonmagnetic (Pauli-like) behavior of the f electrons.

There have been no reports of successful synthesis of any filled skutterudites containing heavier rare earths, M = Gd-Lu, and it was conjectured [1] within the context of the _M_Fe4P12 series that the smaller radii of the heavier M3+ ions prevent adequate bonding to the lattice. However, Tm and Yb are known to be divalent in some compounds, and the radii of divalent Tm and Yb ions are comparable to those of the trivalent light lanthanides (La-Eu). Hence, we hypothesized that divalent Tm and Yb might stabilize the filled skutterudite structure. Ytterbium is especially interesting as it is the 4 _f_-hole analog to Ce, and Yb compounds exhibit many of the same Kondo-like properties seen in Ce intermetallics. [10]

In addition to relatively long-standing interest in the correlated electron physics of filled skutterudite compounds, the recent attention these materials have received is largely due to their potential for thermoelectric applications. [11]-[3] Future measurements of the thermal and transport properties of YbFe4Sb12 will therefore be of great interest in the continuing search for better thermoelectric materials.

## 2 Experimental details

Bulk dc magnetization measurements were made using a commercial Quantum Design MPMS magnetometer over the temperature range 2 < T < 300 K and for values of applied magnetic field H up to 70 kOe. For low-temperature measurements, we employed a Faraday magnetometer equipped with a 3He cryostat with a base temperature of 0.40 K and maximum field of 50 kOe. Transport properties were measured in a commercial Quantum Design PPMS cryostat using a standard four-lead arrangement and an ac resistance bridge operating at 16 Hz with a 1-mA excitation current. The low-temperature specific heat was measured down to 0.55 K in a 3He semiadiabatic calorimeter with a standard heat-pulse technique. The crystal structure and phase purity of the samples were measured using a 9-kW Rigaku powder diffractometer with a rotating copper anode (\lambda_{Cu\ K\alpha} = 1.541 78 A). For more accurate determination of the lattice parameter, a silicon standard was used.

Polycrystalline samples of YbFe4Sb12 were prepared from elemental constituents of purity 99.99% or better that were placed in a vacuum-baked graphite crucible in the stoichiometry Yb1.05Fe4Sb12. The crucible was sealed in a fused quartz ampoule under 150 torr of ultrahigh purity argon, and heated in an induction furnace to a maximum temperature of ~950 degC, verified using an optical pyrometer. Powder x-ray diffractrometry performed on the as-cast induction-melted samples revealed that they were mixed phase and similar to as-cast CeFe4Sb12, [8] being comprised of Sb, FeSb2, and YbSb2, among other unidentified phases. Annealing the sample at 600 degC under argon for 20 h, however, produced a nearly single-phase skutterudite structure. Weak impurity peaks seen in the powder-diffraction pattern were attributed to trace amounts of YbSb2, FeSb2, and Sb. The annealing temperature of 600 degC was determined to be near optimal, as the sample remained in the as-cast mixed phase for annealing temperatures less than 500 degC, and decomposed to FeSb and other phases upon annealing at 750 degC.

 

## III Results and Discussion

The cubic lattice parameter of YbFe_{4}Sb_{12} was determined from x-ray powder diffractometry to be a\!=\!9.158\!\pm\!0.001 A. In Fig. 1 the lattice parameter of MFe_{4}Sb_{12} is plotted versus M, the alkaline-earth or rare-earth atom. The first observation is that the divalent alkaline earths (M\!=\! Ca, Sr, Ba) yield larger values of the lattice parameter than the generally trivalent rare earths. Starting with La, one observes the typical reduction of the lattice parameter due to the contraction of the ionic radii of the rare earths with increasing atomic number. However, the cases of M\!=\! Eu and Yb are clearly anomalous, reflecting their tendency toward divvalence or intermediate valence in contrast to the other rare earths in this series that all appear to be trivalent. It is possible that this larger ionic radius stabilizes Yb and Eu in the skutterudite structure, while all other trivalent rare earths in the range M\!=\! Gd-Tm are too small to be accommodated in the atomic "cages" that are formed by the transition metal-pnicogen sublattice. Note that Tm is also divalent in some compounds, yet our attempts to synthesize TmFe_{4}Sb_{12} by this same technique were unsuccessful. Synthesis of YbFe_{4}P_{12} by a molten metal flux growth technique [1] was also unsuccessful. This is in accord with an earlier observation [14] that the valence of the M ion is strongly influenced by the electronegativity of the pnictogen atom, in that the M valence is higher in the phosphides than in the corresponding antimonides. This could make YbFe_{4}P_{12} unstable as the Yb would be trivalent and thus too small to be accommodated in the structure.

Measurements of the magnetic properties of YbFe_{4}Sb_{12} are also suggestive of intermediate valence of the Yb ions and did not reveal any evidence of superconductivity down to T\!=\!0.40 K. Figure 2 shows isothermal magnetization curves M(H) measured at temperatures 0.4\!<\!T\!<\!100 K that indicate that the magnetic response of YbFe_{4}Sb_{12} may be decomposed into (1) a saturable portion indicative of localized magnetic moments and (2) a susceptibility \chi_{0} evident at high fields and low temperatures that reflects the Pauli paramagnetism of the conduction electrons. The dashed line in Fig. 2 is an estimate of this latter contribution at T\!=\!0.4 K, yielding \chi_{0}\!=\!3.45\!\times\!10^{-2} cm^{3} mol^{-1}. Magnetization data M(H) taken in applied fields up to H\!=\!70 kOe (not shown) allowed us to estimate this high-field susceptibility, indicated by solid circles in Fig. 3, at temperatures up to T\!=\!10 K. We were unable to model the saturable portion of the magnetization M(H) as some function f(H/(T\!-\!\Theta)), where \Theta is a constant, suggesting that this material may exhibit some type of magnetic order at low temperatures. The saturation magnetization as estimated from the y-axis intercept of the dashed line in Fig. 2 corresponds to M_{\rm sat}\!=\!0.2\mu_{B}/f.u. Inverse magnetic susceptibility \chi^{-1}\!=\!H/M vs T data, taken in an applied field H\!=\!55 kOe, are shown in the inset of Fig. 3. The susceptibility can be described by a Curie-Weiss law \chi\!=\!N_{A}\mu_{\rm eff}^{2}/3k_{B}(T\!-\!\Theta_{\rm CW}) in the temperature range 120<\!T\!<\!300 K, and yields an effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff}\!=\!3.09\mu_{B}/f.u. and a Curie-Weiss temperature \Theta_{\rm CW}\!=\!40 K. The effective moment is intermediate between

The dashed line is the conjectured behavior of \chi_{0}(T). Inset: inverse magnetic susceptibility \chi^{-1}\!=\!H/M vs T. The line shows a fit to a Curie-Weiss law for \chi 120\!\!<\!T\!\!<\!300 K.

 the values for Yb^{3+} (\mu_{\rm eff}=4.5\mu_{B}/f.u. for the free ion) and the nonmagnetic Yb^{2+} (\mu_{\rm eff}=0) configurations. In Fig. 3, a comparison of \chi = M/H (open circles) with the high-field susceptibility \chi_{0} (filled circles) is shown. The dashed line is our conjecture for the behavior of \chi_{0}(T) as it merges with the \chi = M/H vs T curve near T = 50 K. Alternatively, our observations of a positive Curie-Weiss temperature, a rounding of the susceptibility near that temperature, and magnetization curves M(H) that do not scale as H/(T - \Theta) could be evidence of ferromagnetic ordering near T = 50 K. The absence of magnetic hysteresis in low-temperature M(H) measurements (Fig. 2) may be explained by a very low coercive field in the ordered state. A more detailed magnetization study as well as neutron-scattering experiments will shed more light on this unusual magnetic behavior at low temperatures. Nonetheless, the high value of \chi_{0} at low temperatures points to a large effective mass of the conduction electrons, a finding that is corroborated by electrical-resistivity and specific-heat measurements.

The electrical resistivity of YbFe_{4}Sb_{12} increases monotonically with temperature up to 300 K, as shown in Fig. 4. We estimate a residual resistivity \rho_{0} \approx 9\mu\Omega cm based on infrared reflectivity measurements.[15] A broad shoulder near T \sim 50 - 70 K was observed in measurements on four separate samples. This shape of the \rho(T) curve is similar to that expected for conduction electrons that scatter into a large narrow feature in the electronic density of states near the Fermi level, which is presumably of f character.[16] The rapid drop in resistivity near 70 K could be a measure of the effective degeneracy of this narrow feature, which may itself be the analogue of an Abrikosov-Suhl resonance for a Kondo lattice of f electrons.

Low-temperature specific-heat data, plotted as C/T vs T^{2}, for YbFe_{4}Sb_{12} shown in Fig. 5 indicate a slightly enhanced electronic specific-heat coefficient \gamma \approx 75 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} in the temperature range 5 < T < 15 K, obtained from a fit of the data to the C(T) = \gamma T + \beta T^{3}, where the latter term is the low-temperature expression for phonons within the Debye model. We estimate the Debye temperature \Theta_{D} = (12\pi^{4}N_{i}R/S\beta)^{1/3} to be 190 K; here N_{i} = 17 is the number of ions per formula unit and R is the universal gas constant. Below T \approx 5 K, \gamma(T) = C/T - \beta T^{2} shows a nearly linear increase with decreasing temperatures to 140 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}, as shown in the lower inset of Fig. 5. A sharp upturn occurs below T \approx 1 K, and while no accompanying feature in the magnetization indicative of magnetic ordering was seen down to 0.4 K, the feature was modeled as the high-temperature tail of a Schottky anomaly that varies as T^{-2}. We were able to fit the specific heat in the temperature range T = 0.6 - 1.0 K to the form C(T) = \gamma T + D T^{- 2} with \gamma and D as adjustable parameters, obtaining \gamma = 140 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}. The Schottky anomaly is possibly due to trace amounts of magnetic impurities in the sample.

The moderate enhancement of the electronic specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility is very similar to other heavy-fermion Yb compounds such as YbCu_{4}Ag (Ref. [10]) and YbCuAl.[17] In order to determine whether the large values of \chi_{0}(0) and \gamma(0) are associated with itinerant f electrons, we estimated the Wilson-Sommerfeld ratio for YbFe_{4}Sb_{12}:

\[R = \left\langle \frac{\chi_{0}(0)}{\gamma(0)} \right\rangle\frac{\pi^{2}k_{\rm B}^{2}}{\mu_{\rm eff}^{2}}.\]

Using \mu_{\rm eff}=4.5\mu_{B} appropriate for Yb^{3+} free ions, \chi_{0}(0) = 3.45\times 10^{-2} cm^{3} mol^{-1}, and \gamma(0) = 140 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}, we obtain R = 2.62. This value is in good agreement with R = 2 expected for a spin \downarrow Kondo effect, indicating that the enhancements of \chi_{0} and \gamma are due to heavy electrons attributable to either intermediate valent Yb ions or a Kondo lattice of screened Yb^{3+} moments.

In conclusion, we have synthesized the filled skutterudite compound YbFe_{4}Sb_{12} and have found the cubic lattice parameter to be anomalous with respect to the other predominantly trivalent rare earths M in MFe_{4}Sb_{12}, which is indicative of an Yb valence intermediate between 2 + and 3 +. The magnetic, electrical transport, and thermal properties measured to low temperatures are consistent with heavy-fermion or intermediate-valence behavior associated with the Yb ions. Based on these measurements, we estimate an effective

  degeneracy temperature T^{*}\!\sim\!50 K for a narrow f-electron feature in the density of states near the Fermi level. Below T\!\sim\!5 K, the coefficient of the electronic specific heat increases to \gamma\!=\!140 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and the linear magnetic susceptibility saturates to \chi_{0}\!=\!3.45\!\times\!10^{-2} cm^{3} mol^{-1}, pointing to a moderately enhanced effective mass of the conduction electrons. Neutron-scattering and high-temperature specific-heat measurements are planned to address the issue of magnetic ordering and assess the thermal parameters of the Yb ion, while Seebeck-coefficient and thermal-conductivity measurements will be performed to determine the thermoelectric figure of merit _ZT_. Clearly, this compound as well as many other members of the filled skutterudites continue to be fascinating subjects of both applied and basic research.

The dashed line is our conjecture for the behavior of \chi_{0}(T) as it merges with the \chi = M/H vs T curve near T = 50 K. Alternatively, our observations of a positive Curie-Weiss temperature, a rounding of the susceptibility near that temperature, and magnetization curves M(H) that do not scale as H/(T - \Theta) could be evidence of ferromagnetic ordering near T = 50 K. The absence of magnetic hysteresis in low-temperature M(H) measurements (Fig. 2) may be explained by a very low coercive field in the ordered state. A more detailed magnetization study as well as neutron-scattering experiments will shed more light on this unusual magnetic behavior at low temperatures. Nonetheless, the high value of \chi_{0} at low temperatures points to a large effective mass of the conduction electrons, a finding that is corroborated by electrical-resistivity and specific-heat measurements.

The electrical resistivity of YbFe_{4}Sb_{12} increases monotonically with temperature up to 300 K, as shown in Fig. 4. We estimate a residual resistivity \rho_{0} \approx 9\mu\Omega cm based on infrared reflectivity measurements.[15] A broad shoulder near T \sim 50 - 70 K was observed in measurements on four separate samples. This shape of the \rho(T) curve is similar to that expected for conduction electrons that scatter into a large narrow feature in the electronic density of states near the Fermi level, which is presumably of f character.[16] The rapid drop in resistivity near 70 K could be a measure of the effective degeneracy of this narrow feature, which may itself be the analogue of an Abrikosov-Suhl resonance for a Kondo lattice of f electrons.

Low-temperature specific-heat data, plotted as C/T vs T^{2}, for YbFe_{4}Sb_{12} shown in Fig. 5 indicate a slightly enhanced electronic specific-heat coefficient \gamma \approx 75 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} in the temperature range 5 < T < 15 K, obtained from a fit of the data to the C(T) = \gamma T + \beta T^{3}, where the latter term is the low-temperature expression for phonons within the Debye model. We estimate the Debye temperature \Theta_{D} = (12\pi^{4}N_{i}R/S\beta)^{1/3} to be 190 K; here N_{i} = 17 is the number of ions per formula unit and R is the universal gas constant. Below T \approx 5 K, \gamma(T) = C/T - \beta T^{2} shows a nearly linear increase with decreasing temperatures to 140 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}, as shown in the lower inset of Fig. 5. A sharp upturn occurs below T \approx 1 K, and while no accompanying feature in the magnetization indicative of magnetic ordering was seen down to 0.4 K, the feature was modeled as the high-temperature tail of a Schottky anomaly that varies as T^{-2}. We were able to fit the specific heat in the temperature range T = 0.6 - 1.0 K to the form C(T) = \gamma T + D T^{- 2} with \gamma and D as adjustable parameters, obtaining \gamma = 140 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}. The Schottky anomaly is possibly due to trace amounts of magnetic impurities in the sample.

The moderate enhancement of the electronic specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility is very similar to other heavy-fermion Yb compounds such as YbCu_{4}Ag (Ref. [10]) and YbCuAl.[17] In order to determine whether the large values of \chi_{0}(0) and \gamma(0) are associated with itinerant f electrons, we estimated the Wilson-Sommerfeld ratio for YbFe_{4}Sb_{12}:

\[R = \left\langle \frac{\chi_{0}(0)}{\gamma(0)} \right\rangle\frac{\pi^{2}k_{\rm B}^{2}}{\mu_{\rm eff}^{2}}.\]

Using \mu_{\rm eff}=4.5\mu_{B} appropriate for Yb^{3+} free ions, \chi_{0}(0) = 3.45\times 10^{-2} cm^{3} mol^{-1}, and \gamma(0) = 140 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}, we obtain R = 2.62. This value is in good agreement with R = 2 expected for a spin \downarrow Kondo effect, indicating that the enhancements of \chi_{0} and \gamma are due to heavy electrons attributable to either intermediate valent Yb ions or a Kondo lattice of screened Yb^{3+} moments.

In conclusion, we have synthesized the filled skutterudite compound YbFe_{4}Sb_{12} and have found the cubic lattice parameter to be anomalous with respect to the other predominantly trivalent rare earths M in MFe_{4}Sb_{12}, which is indicative of an Yb valence intermediate between 2 + and 3 +. The magnetic, electrical transport, and thermal properties measured to low temperatures are consistent with heavy-fermion or intermediate-valence behavior associated with the Yb ions. Based on these measurements, we estimate an effective

Below T = 4 K, C/T approaches a value of 140 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}, and an upturn in C/T below T = 1 K is likely due to a Schottky anomaly.

Below T\!\sim\!5 K, the coefficient of the electronic specific heat increases to \gamma\!=\!140 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and the linear magnetic susceptibility saturates to \chi_{0}\!=\!3.45\!\times\!10^{-2} cm^{3} mol^{-1}, pointing to a moderately enhanced effective mass of the conduction electrons. Neutron-scattering and high-temperature specific-heat measurements are planned to address the issue of magnetic ordering and assess the thermal parameters of the Yb ion, while Seebeck-coefficient and thermal-conductivity measurements will be performed to determine the thermoelectric figure of merit _ZT_. Clearly, this compound as well as many other members of the filled skutterudites continue to be fascinating subjects of both applied and basic research.
