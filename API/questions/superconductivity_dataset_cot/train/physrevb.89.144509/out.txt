###### Abstract

Superconducting phases of (NH_{3})_{y}M_{x}FeSe_{1-x}Te_{z} have been synthesized by the intercalation of metal atoms (M: Li, Na, Ca) into FeSe and FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} using a low-temperature liquid NH_{3} technique. The superconducting transition temperature (T_{\rm c}) is 31.5 K for Na-doped FeSe, and for Li-, Na-, and Ca-doped FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} it is 26, 22, and 17 K, respectively. The 31.5 K superconducting is the superconducting phase in ammoniated Na-doped FeSe. The T_{\rm c} is lower than that (onset T_{\rm c} = 46 K) of the superconducting phase reported previously. The reason why the T_{\rm c} of this phase is lower is discussed based on the structure. The pressure dependences of T_{\rm c} in the (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{0.5}FeSe and (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{0.4}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} samples have been measured and a negative pressure dependence is observed; i.e., a decrease in lattice constant c leads to a decrease in T_{\rm c}, consistent with the behavior of (NH_{3})_{0.5}FeSe reported previously by our group. Furthermore, the magnetic behavior of (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{0.4}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} has been fully investigated at different applied magnetic fields (H) to determine the critical magnetic field. This is a successful metal intercalation into FeSe_{1-x}Te_{z} (z \neq 0) and an observation of superconductivity.

The dc magnetic susceptibilities, _M_/_H_'s, of the prepared samples were measured and compared with previous reports [9, 10] to ensure sample quality. The _M_/_H_ was measured with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS2). The M refers to magnetization. The T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} values of the prepared samples [9 K for _b_-FeSe and 14.2 K for _b_-FeSe0.5Te0.5; see Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)] are consistent with those in Refs. [9, 10] (T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} = 8 K for z = 0 and T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} = 14 K for z = 0.5 in _b_-FeSe1-_T_c2). The shielding fraction was ~100% for both samples at 3 K. For the precise identification of the _b_-FeSe0.5Te0.5 sample, the XRD pattern was measured and analyzed using Le Bail fitting with the space group P4/_mmn_ (No. 129). The XRD pattern was measured with wavelength l = 0.710 73 A using a Mo _K_a_ source (Rigaku R-AXIS RAPID-NR). The lattice constants for the _b_-FeSe0.5Te0.5 sample [_a_ = 3.8420(2) A and c = 6.0969(3) A] as determined from the XRD pattern are much larger than those of _b_-FeSe [_a_ = 3.7747(1) A and c = 5.5229(1)] [9], while the a and c were close to those reported previously for _b_-FeSe0.5Te0.5 [_a_ = 3.7909(5) A and c = 5.957(1) A] [11], establishing that this sample was _b_-FeSe0.5Te0.5.

Samples of (NH3)3M4FeSe1-_T_c2: (_M_ = Li, Na, and Ca) were synthesized using the liquid NH3 technique described in Ref. [6]. Experimental details of the synthesis are described in the Supplemental Material [12]. The experimental nominal value, x, of Na is 0.5 in _b_-FeSe (_z_ = 0) for the low-_T_c phase (T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} = 36 K), and the x is increased to 1.0 in making high-_T_c phase (T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} = 46 K). The x value is 0.4 for Na and Ca, and 0.5 for Li in _b_-FeSe0.5Te0.5 (or z = 0.5). Throughout this paper, the chemical composition of samples is represented by the experimental nominal value. The y value, or amount of NH3, was not determined in this study. The XRD patterns for two phases in (NH3)3NaFeSe and for (NH3)3Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5 were recorded at 300 K and analyzed using Le Bail fitting with the space group _14/mmm_ (No. 139). The same x-ray diffractometer (Mo _K_a source) was used in the XRD measurements.

The _M_/_H_ curves for the (NH3)3NaFeSe (_x_ = 0.5 and 1.0), (NH3)3Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5, (NH3)3,Te0.5Fe0.5Te0.5, and (NH3)3,Ca0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5 samples were measured using the SQUID magnetometer described above. The _M_/_H_ curves for the (NH3)3,Na0.5FeSe and (NH3)3Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5 samples were measured under high pressure with a Be-Cu piston cylinder cell using the same SQUID magnetometer. All samples were introduced into cells (glass capillary for XRD, quartz cell for _M_/_H_ measurement under ambient pressure, and Be-Cu piston cylinder cell for _M_/_H_ measurement under high pressure) without any exposure to air in an Ar-filled glove box.

Figure 2(a) shows the _M_/_H_ curves of (NH3)3Na0.5FeSe measured in the zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) modes as a function of temperature, and the _T_c and T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} were determined to be 31.5 and 36 K from the _M_/_H_ curves under ZFC, and _T_c = 32 K and T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} = 32.5 K under FC. The determination of _T_c is shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a). No superconducting phase of pure _b_-FeSe was found from the _M_/_H_ curves in Fig. 2(a). This superconducting phase is distinctly different from that reported previously for (NH3)3Na0.5FeSe [3], in which the T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} was 46 K. Neither _M_/_H_ curve in the ZFC nor FC mode indicated the presence of such a high-_T_c phase. We made six (NH3)3Ne0.5FeSe samples. Five samples showed a single T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} of ~34 K, while only one sample showed two T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}}'s (or two superconducting phases) of ~44 and ~36 K. The average T_{\text{c}} ((T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}})) and the average T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} ((T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}})), determined from the _M_/_H_ curves in the ZFC mode for five samples (low-_T_c phase), are 31(2) K and 34(2) K, respectively. Thus, the (NH3)3,Na0.5FeSe sample sample prepared with our synthetic method mainly produces the low-_T_c phase. The main difference between our synthesis and the previous one [3] is the temperature during synthesis. The former was -50 degC, while the latter was room temperature. Furthermore, we made five (NH3)3,Li0.5FeSe samples that showed almost the same T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} (=42 K) as the previous one, for which T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} = 44 K [3]. Therefore, it is not clear whether the finding of the low-_T_c phase in (NH3)3Na0.5FeSe may be due to the low synthesis temperature.

Very recently, we preliminarily tried to vary the nominal x value in making the (NH3)3NaFeSe samples, and some high-_T_c phases (T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}}\sim46 K) were successfully prepared in large nominal x value (_x_ ~1.0), indicating the different Na amount between low-_T_c and high-_T_c phases [13]. The XRD patterns of both phases in (NH3)3NaFeSe samples are shown in Figs. S1 and S2 in the Supplemental Material [12], and the XRD patterns were analyzed with Le Bail fitting to determine the lattice constants. The analyses for both XRD patterns were successfully achieved with the same space group (_14/mmn_: No. 139), indicating that both phases

  take the same crystal symmetry. The lattice constants are a = 3.891(2) A and c = 14.269(4) A for the low-_T_c phase, while they are a = 3.8275(6) A and c = 17.579(5) A for the high-_T_c phase; the c [17.579(5) A] of the high-_T_c phase is consistent with that [_c_ = 17.432(1) A] reported previously [3]. The experimental nominal x values in the (NH3)3Na6 FeSe samples used for the above XRD measurements were 0.4 for the low-_T_c phase and 1.0 for the high-_T_c phase. The x value of 0.4 [(NH3)3/Na0.4 FeSe] predominantly provided the low-_T_c phase (_T_c onset~36 K) in the same manner as x = 0.5 [(NH3)3/Na0.5 FeSe]. Here it should be noticed that the x of 1.0 exceeds the feasible x value (=0.5) in the case of the full occupancy of Na at the 2a site of the _14/mmm_ structure, which means that the experimental nominal value deviates from the real x. We previously determined 0.255(5) as the real x in the (NH3)3/Cs0.4 FeSe sample [6], suggesting that the real x value is approximately 50% of the experimental nominal value [6]. To sum up, it can be concluded from the results of XRD that the _T_c can be unambiguously scaled by the c, or plane spacing between FeSe layers, as suggested in our previous paper [6]; i.e., the larger c produces the higher _T_c. The difference of c in the low-_T_c and high-_T_c phases may be due to that in the amount of Na (or _x_). This study is now in progress.

Figure 2(b) shows the _M_/_H_ curves of (NH3)3Na0.5 FeSe at different pressures, and the pressure dependence of _T_c was determined from the curves. The plot of _T_c vs p is shown in Fig. 2(c). The _T_c of (NH3)3/Na0.5 FeSe decreases almost linearly with increasing pressure up to 1 GPa, and the _T_c's determined while reducing the pressure from 1 GPa are shown on the _T_c-_p_ plot made under increasing pressure. The _dT_c/_dp_ was determined to be -7.7(4) K GPa-1 from the plot in the range from 0 to 1 GPa. In Fig. 2(c), we plotted the _T_c of (NH3)3/Cs0.4 FeSe as a function of pressure for comparison, based on data from Ref. [6]. The _T_c-_p_ plot for (NH3)3/Cs0.4 FeSe shows a positive deviation at 0-1 GPa, i.e., the plot deviates positively from a straight line, but the _T_c-_p_ plot for (NH3)3/Na0.5 FeSe does not show such a deviation. Consequently, the behavior of _T_c in (NH3)3/Na0.5 FeSe shows a simple negative pressure dependence.

We have already investigated the pressure dependence of plane spacing between FeSe layers in (NH3)3/Cs0.4 FeSe at 0-40 GPa [14], showing a monotonic decrease with increasing pressure over this wide pressure range. In this pressure range (0-11 GPa) the _T_c decreased with increasing pressure despite a small positive deviation at 0-1 GPa [6,14], i.e., the decrease in _T_c can be closely related to the decrease in plane spacing. This is exactly consistent with the chemical pressure effect observed for (NH3)3/_M_x FeSe [3,6], in which the _T_c becomes lower when the plane spacing is smaller. Although data on the pressure dependence of plane spacing in (NH3)3/Na0.5 FeSe have not yet been reported, the simple negative pressure dependence observed for _T_c suggests a simple correlation with plane spacing without any structural phase transition at 0-1 GPa.

Here, we discuss briefly why such a simple negative pressure dependence is observed in the low-_T_c phase in (NH3)3/Na0.5 FeSe. It is well known that the _T_c in FeSe rapidly increases with an increase in pressure up to 4 GPa. The behavior is explained by the scenario that the anion height of FeSe reaches the ideal value (1.39 A) when applying pressure [10]. Very recently, we investigated the relationship of _T_c and anion height in (NH3)3/Cs0.4 FeSe based on the pressure dependences of _T_c and anion height [14], showing that the _T_c decreases regardless of approaching the ideal value of anion height (1.39 A) by applying pressure. This means that (NH3)3/_M_x FeSe cannot be understood in the analogy with FeSe. Although we cannot clearly answer the origin of difference in pressure dependence between FeSe and (NH3)3/_M_x FeSe, the _T_c of (NH3)3/_M_x FeSe may decrease owing to the shrinkage of c caused by applying pressure. Actually, the simple shrinkage of c by applying pressure is found in (NH3)3/Cs0.4 FeSe [14]. The difference in pressure dependence

  between nondoped and doped FeSe materials is still one of the most important problems to be solved in this research.

Figure 3(a) shows the M/H curves of (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}Na_{0.4}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} measured in the ZFC and FC modes as a function of temperature; the T_{\rm{c}} and T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} were determined to be 22 and 24 K from the M/H curves in the ZFC mode, respectively, and T_{\rm{c}} = 21 K and T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 23 K in the FC mode. The shielding fraction of (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}Na_{0.4}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} was evaluated to be 100% at 5 K from the M/H curve in the ZFC mode. In the M/H plots, no superconducting phases of pure \beta-FeSe and \beta-FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} are observed. We made four (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{n}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} samples, and the \langle T_{\rm{c}}\rangle and \langle T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}}\rangle were determined to be 22(1) K and 23.5(6) K, respectively, from the M/H curves in the ZFC mode for the four samples. The \langle T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}}\rangle of (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{n}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} at 23.5 K, is lower than the T_{\rm{c}}'s of (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{n}}_{\rm{0.5}}FeSe (T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 46 K in Ref. [3] and T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 36 K in the low-T_{\rm{c}} phase found in this study). The lower T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} and T_{\rm{c}} observed in (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{n}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} does not support the prediction that a higher T_{\rm{c}} may be observed because of the higher T_{\rm{c}} (\sim14 K) seen in pure \beta-FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} compared to that (\sim8 K) in pure \beta-FeSe [9, 10]. Furthermore, the observation of higher T_{\rm{c}} may be expected because the c of \beta-FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5}, 5.957(1) A [11], is larger than that of \beta-FeSe [5.5229(1) or 5.5234(1) A] [6, 9]. Therefore, it may not be easily explainable that the T_{\rm{c}} in (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{n}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} is lower than the T_{\rm{c}}'s in (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{n}}_{\rm{0.5}}FeSe.

Furthermore, we measured the XRD pattern of (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{n}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} in order to determine the lattice constants and compare them with those of the high-T_{\rm{c}} and low-T_{\rm{c}} phases of (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{0.5}}FeSe. The XRD pattern is shown in Fig. S3 in the Supplemental Material [12]. The Le Bail analysis was performed with the space group (_14/mmm_, No. 139). The lattice constants are a = 3.9822(6) A and c = 17.798(7) A for (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5}. Although the c is slightly larger than that [17.578(5) A] of the high-T_{\rm{c}} phase of (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{a}}FeSe, the T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} (23.5 K) of (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} is much lower than that (T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 46 K) of the high-T_{\rm{c}} phase, indicating that the T_{\rm{c}} cannot be universally scaled by c for all metal-doped FeSe_{1-z}Te_{z} materials, i.e., the T_{\rm{c}} in (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} may be universally scaled by the plane spacing of FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} layers. To explain the low T_{\rm{c}}, we may need to consider additional factors such as structural disorder accompanied by the partial replacement of Se by Te, which may lead to the suppression of a superconducting phase.

Figures 3(b) and 3(c) show the M/H curves of (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{10.5}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} and (NH_{3})_{\rm{C}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} measured in the ZFC and FC modes as a function of temperature. The T_{\rm{c}} and T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} for (NH_{3})_{\rm{C}}_{\rm{0.5}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} were, respectively, determined to be 26 and 29 K in the ZFC mode, while T_{\rm{c}} = 26 K and T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 27 K in the FC mode. The T_{\rm{c}} and T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} for (NH_{3})_{\rm{C}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} were, respectively, determined to be 17 and 18 K in the ZFC mode, and T_{\rm{c}} = 17 K and T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 18 K in the FC mode. Consequently, the T_{\rm{c}} of Li-doped FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} is the highest among Na-, Li-, and Ca-doped samples (T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 24 K for Na, T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 29 K for Li, and T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 18 K for Ca), in contrast to metal-doped FeSe solids, among which Na-doped FeSe is the highest (T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 46 K for Na, T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 44 K for Li, and T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}}\sim40 K for Ca) [3]. The shielding fractions for (NH_{3})_{\rm{10.5}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} and (NH_{3})_{\rm{C}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} are 80% and 92%, respectively, at 2.5 K. In the M/H curves [Figs. 3(b) and 3(c)], no superconducting phases of \beta-FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} and \beta-FeSe are found. For (NH_{3})_{\rm{Li0.5}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5}, we made only one sample, while for (NH_{3})_{\rm{C}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} four samples were made, and the \langle T_{\rm{c}}\rangle and \langle T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}}\rangle were determined to be 16(1) and 17

 which is close to the _H_c2 of 16.3 T for FeSe polycrystals [15]. However, the _H_c2 of 17 T is much smaller than the 36.5 T of (NH3),Ba0.4FeSe [3]. The _M_-_H_ plot measured at 5 K is shown in Fig. 4(c), and the _H_c1 at 5 K was determined to be 100 Oe from the expanded plot [inset of Fig. 4(c)]. In this study, we could not evaluate the _H_c1 at 0 K from the _M_-_T_ plots [Fig. 4(a)].

The _M_/_H_-_T_ plots at different pressures are shown in Fig. 5(a), and the drop in the _M_/_H_ plot gradually goes to the left as pressure is applied. The pressure dependence of _T_c for (NH3),Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5 is shown in Fig. 5(b). The _T_c decreases with increasing pressure. As a reference, in Fig. 5(b) the _T_c-_p_ plot of (NH3),Cs0.4FeSe is shown in the graph, as in Fig. 2(c). The _T_c-_p_ plots in both phases show a negative pressure dependence, but the fall of the _T_c-_p_ plot in (NH3),Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5 is more rapid than that of (NH3),Cs0.4FeSe [6]. Saturation is observed in the _T_c-_p_ plot for (NH3),Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5 above 0.6 GPa, in contrast to (NH3),Cs0.4FeSe [6]. When a linear approximation is applied to the _T_c-_P_ plots (0-0.6 GPa) of (NH3),Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5, the _dT_c/_dp_ is approximately -11.7(5) K GPa-1 for (NH3),Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5, while the _dT_c/_dp_ is -4.33(8) K GPa-1 for (NH3),Cs0.4FeSe [6], and -7.7(4) K GPa-1 for (NH3),Na0.5FeSe (in this study). Thus, the _dT_c/_dp_ values, -7.7(4) K GPa-1 and -11.7(5) K GPa-1, for (NH3),Na0.5FeSe and (NH3),Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5 are larger than that that [-4.33(8) K GPa-1] for (NH3),Cs0.4FeSe. Furthermore, it is not clear why saturation is observed in the high-pressure range (0.6 GPa <= p <= 1.0 GPa) of (NH3),Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5, contrary to (NH3),Cs0.4FeSe and (NH3),Na0.5FeSe. The pressure dependence of _T_c in (NH3),Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5 in the pressure range above 1 GPa is of interest to clarify the origin of the saturation, and that work is now in progress.

In conclusion, we have succeeded in multiple syntheses of superconducting phases through the intercalation of alkali and alkali-earth metal atoms into FeSe and FeSe0.5Te0.5. A superconducting phase was found in (NH3),Na0.5FeSe, which is a lower _T_c phase than was previously reported [3], indicating the presence of multiple superconducting phases. Furthermore, it has been found that the high-_T_c phase possesses a larger c than that of the low-_T_c phase in (NH3),NaFeSe, consistent with the scaling of _T_c by c in (NH3),_M_x FeSe materials.

###### Abstract

Superconducting phases of (NH_{3})_{y}M_{x}FeSe_{1-x}Te_{z} have been synthesized by the intercalation of metal atoms (M: Li, Na, Ca) into FeSe and FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} using a low-temperature liquid NH_{3} technique. The superconducting transition temperature (T_{\rm c}) is 31.5 K for Na-doped FeSe, and for Li-, Na-, and Ca-doped FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} it is 26, 22, and 17 K, respectively. The 31.5 K superconducting is the superconducting phase in ammoniated Na-doped FeSe. The T_{\rm c} is lower than that (onset T_{\rm c} = 46 K) of the superconducting phase reported previously. The reason why the T_{\rm c} of this phase is lower is discussed based on the structure. The pressure dependences of T_{\rm c} in the (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{0.5}FeSe and (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{0.4}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} samples have been measured and a negative pressure dependence is observed; i.e., a decrease in lattice constant c leads to a decrease in T_{\rm c}, consistent with the behavior of (NH_{3})_{0.5}FeSe reported previously by our group. Furthermore, the magnetic behavior of (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{0.4}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} has been fully investigated at different applied magnetic fields (H) to determine the critical magnetic field. This is a successful metal intercalation into FeSe_{1-x}Te_{z} (z \neq 0) and an observation of superconductivity.

The dc magnetic susceptibilities, _M_/_H_'s, of the prepared samples were measured and compared with previous reports [9, 10] to ensure sample quality. The _M_/_H_ was measured with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS2). The M refers to magnetization. The T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} values of the prepared samples [9 K for _b_-FeSe and 14.2 K for _b_-FeSe0.5Te0.5; see Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)] are consistent with those in Refs. [9, 10] (T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} = 8 K for z = 0 and T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} = 14 K for z = 0.5 in _b_-FeSe1-_T_c2). The shielding fraction was ~100% for both samples at 3 K. For the precise identification of the _b_-FeSe0.5Te0.5 sample, the XRD pattern was measured and analyzed using Le Bail fitting with the space group P4/_mmn_ (No. 129). The XRD pattern was measured with wavelength l = 0.710 73 A using a Mo _K_a_ source (Rigaku R-AXIS RAPID-NR). The lattice constants for the _b_-FeSe0.5Te0.5 sample [_a_ = 3.8420(2) A and c = 6.0969(3) A] as determined from the XRD pattern are much larger than those of _b_-FeSe [_a_ = 3.7747(1) A and c = 5.5229(1)] [9], while the a and c were close to those reported previously for _b_-FeSe0.5Te0.5 [_a_ = 3.7909(5) A and c = 5.957(1) A] [11], establishing that this sample was _b_-FeSe0.5Te0.5.

Samples of (NH3)3M4FeSe1-_T_c2: (_M_ = Li, Na, and Ca) were synthesized using the liquid NH3 technique described in Ref. [6]. Experimental details of the synthesis are described in the Supplemental Material [12]. The experimental nominal value, x, of Na is 0.5 in _b_-FeSe (_z_ = 0) for the low-_T_c phase (T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} = 36 K), and the x is increased to 1.0 in making high-_T_c phase (T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} = 46 K). The x value is 0.4 for Na and Ca, and 0.5 for Li in _b_-FeSe0.5Te0.5 (or z = 0.5). Throughout this paper, the chemical composition of samples is represented by the experimental nominal value. The y value, or amount of NH3, was not determined in this study. The XRD patterns for two phases in (NH3)3NaFeSe and for (NH3)3Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5 were recorded at 300 K and analyzed using Le Bail fitting with the space group _14/mmm_ (No. 139). The same x-ray diffractometer (Mo _K_a source) was used in the XRD measurements.

The _M_/_H_ curves for the (NH3)3NaFeSe (_x_ = 0.5 and 1.0), (NH3)3Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5, (NH3)3,Te0.5Fe0.5Te0.5, and (NH3)3,Ca0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5 samples were measured using the SQUID magnetometer described above. The _M_/_H_ curves for the (NH3)3,Na0.5FeSe and (NH3)3Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5 samples were measured under high pressure with a Be-Cu piston cylinder cell using the same SQUID magnetometer. All samples were introduced into cells (glass capillary for XRD, quartz cell for _M_/_H_ measurement under ambient pressure, and Be-Cu piston cylinder cell for _M_/_H_ measurement under high pressure) without any exposure to air in an Ar-filled glove box.

Figure 2(a) shows the _M_/_H_ curves of (NH3)3Na0.5FeSe measured in the zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) modes as a function of temperature, and the _T_c and T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} were determined to be 31.5 and 36 K from the _M_/_H_ curves under ZFC, and _T_c = 32 K and T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} = 32.5 K under FC. The determination of _T_c is shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a). No superconducting phase of pure _b_-FeSe was found from the _M_/_H_ curves in Fig. 2(a). This superconducting phase is distinctly different from that reported previously for (NH3)3Na0.5FeSe [3], in which the T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} was 46 K. Neither _M_/_H_ curve in the ZFC nor FC mode indicated the presence of such a high-_T_c phase. We made six (NH3)3Ne0.5FeSe samples. Five samples showed a single T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} of ~34 K, while only one sample showed two T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}}'s (or two superconducting phases) of ~44 and ~36 K. The average T_{\text{c}} ((T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}})) and the average T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} ((T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}})), determined from the _M_/_H_ curves in the ZFC mode for five samples (low-_T_c phase), are 31(2) K and 34(2) K, respectively. Thus, the (NH3)3,Na0.5FeSe sample sample prepared with our synthetic method mainly produces the low-_T_c phase. The main difference between our synthesis and the previous one [3] is the temperature during synthesis. The former was -50 degC, while the latter was room temperature. Furthermore, we made five (NH3)3,Li0.5FeSe samples that showed almost the same T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} (=42 K) as the previous one, for which T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} = 44 K [3]. Therefore, it is not clear whether the finding of the low-_T_c phase in (NH3)3Na0.5FeSe may be due to the low synthesis temperature.

Very recently, we preliminarily tried to vary the nominal x value in making the (NH3)3NaFeSe samples, and some high-_T_c phases (T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}}\sim46 K) were successfully prepared in large nominal x value (_x_ ~1.0), indicating the different Na amount between low-_T_c and high-_T_c phases [13]. The XRD patterns of both phases in (NH3)3NaFeSe samples are shown in Figs. S1 and S2 in the Supplemental Material [12], and the XRD patterns were analyzed with Le Bail fitting to determine the lattice constants. The analyses for both XRD patterns were successfully achieved with the same space group (_14/mmn_: No. 139), indicating that both phases

  take the same crystal symmetry. The lattice constants are a = 3.891(2) A and c = 14.269(4) A for the low-_T_c phase, while they are a = 3.8275(6) A and c = 17.579(5) A for the high-_T_c phase; the c [17.579(5) A] of the high-_T_c phase is consistent with that [_c_ = 17.432(1) A] reported previously [3]. The experimental nominal x values in the (NH3)3Na6 FeSe samples used for the above XRD measurements were 0.4 for the low-_T_c phase and 1.0 for the high-_T_c phase. The x value of 0.4 [(NH3)3/Na0.4 FeSe] predominantly provided the low-_T_c phase (_T_c onset~36 K) in the same manner as x = 0.5 [(NH3)3/Na0.5 FeSe]. Here it should be noticed that the x of 1.0 exceeds the feasible x value (=0.5) in the case of the full occupancy of Na at the 2a site of the _14/mmm_ structure, which means that the experimental nominal value deviates from the real x. We previously determined 0.255(5) as the real x in the (NH3)3/Cs0.4 FeSe sample [6], suggesting that the real x value is approximately 50% of the experimental nominal value [6]. To sum up, it can be concluded from the results of XRD that the _T_c can be unambiguously scaled by the c, or plane spacing between FeSe layers, as suggested in our previous paper [6]; i.e., the larger c produces the higher _T_c. The difference of c in the low-_T_c and high-_T_c phases may be due to that in the amount of Na (or _x_). This study is now in progress.

Figure 2(b) shows the _M_/_H_ curves of (NH3)3Na0.5 FeSe at different pressures, and the pressure dependence of _T_c was determined from the curves. The plot of _T_c vs p is shown in Fig. 2(c). The _T_c of (NH3)3/Na0.5 FeSe decreases almost linearly with increasing pressure up to 1 GPa, and the _T_c's determined while reducing the pressure from 1 GPa are shown on the _T_c-_p_ plot made under increasing pressure. The _dT_c/_dp_ was determined to be -7.7(4) K GPa-1 from the plot in the range from 0 to 1 GPa. In Fig. 2(c), we plotted the _T_c of (NH3)3/Cs0.4 FeSe as a function of pressure for comparison, based on data from Ref. [6]. The _T_c-_p_ plot for (NH3)3/Cs0.4 FeSe shows a positive deviation at 0-1 GPa, i.e., the plot deviates positively from a straight line, but the _T_c-_p_ plot for (NH3)3/Na0.5 FeSe does not show such a deviation. Consequently, the behavior of _T_c in (NH3)3/Na0.5 FeSe shows a simple negative pressure dependence.

We have already investigated the pressure dependence of plane spacing between FeSe layers in (NH3)3/Cs0.4 FeSe at 0-40 GPa [14], showing a monotonic decrease with increasing pressure over this wide pressure range. In this pressure range (0-11 GPa) the _T_c decreased with increasing pressure despite a small positive deviation at 0-1 GPa [6,14], i.e., the decrease in _T_c can be closely related to the decrease in plane spacing. This is exactly consistent with the chemical pressure effect observed for (NH3)3/_M_x FeSe [3,6], in which the _T_c becomes lower when the plane spacing is smaller. Although data on the pressure dependence of plane spacing in (NH3)3/Na0.5 FeSe have not yet been reported, the simple negative pressure dependence observed for _T_c suggests a simple correlation with plane spacing without any structural phase transition at 0-1 GPa.

Here, we discuss briefly why such a simple negative pressure dependence is observed in the low-_T_c phase in (NH3)3/Na0.5 FeSe. It is well known that the _T_c in FeSe rapidly increases with an increase in pressure up to 4 GPa. The behavior is explained by the scenario that the anion height of FeSe reaches the ideal value (1.39 A) when applying pressure [10]. Very recently, we investigated the relationship of _T_c and anion height in (NH3)3/Cs0.4 FeSe based on the pressure dependences of _T_c and anion height [14], showing that the _T_c decreases regardless of approaching the ideal value of anion height (1.39 A) by applying pressure. This means that (NH3)3/_M_x FeSe cannot be understood in the analogy with FeSe. Although we cannot clearly answer the origin of difference in pressure dependence between FeSe and (NH3)3/_M_x FeSe, the _T_c of (NH3)3/_M_x FeSe may decrease owing to the shrinkage of c caused by applying pressure. Actually, the simple shrinkage of c by applying pressure is found in (NH3)3/Cs0.4 FeSe [14]. The difference in pressure dependence

  between nondoped and doped FeSe materials is still one of the most important problems to be solved in this research.

Figure 3(a) shows the M/H curves of (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}Na_{0.4}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} measured in the ZFC and FC modes as a function of temperature; the T_{\rm{c}} and T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} were determined to be 22 and 24 K from the M/H curves in the ZFC mode, respectively, and T_{\rm{c}} = 21 K and T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 23 K in the FC mode. The shielding fraction of (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}Na_{0.4}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} was evaluated to be 100% at 5 K from the M/H curve in the ZFC mode. In the M/H plots, no superconducting phases of pure \beta-FeSe and \beta-FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} are observed. We made four (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{n}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} samples, and the \langle T_{\rm{c}}\rangle and \langle T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}}\rangle were determined to be 22(1) K and 23.5(6) K, respectively, from the M/H curves in the ZFC mode for the four samples. The \langle T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}}\rangle of (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{n}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} at 23.5 K, is lower than the T_{\rm{c}}'s of (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{n}}_{\rm{0.5}}FeSe (T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 46 K in Ref. [3] and T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 36 K in the low-T_{\rm{c}} phase found in this study). The lower T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} and T_{\rm{c}} observed in (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{n}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} does not support the prediction that a higher T_{\rm{c}} may be observed because of the higher T_{\rm{c}} (\sim14 K) seen in pure \beta-FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} compared to that (\sim8 K) in pure \beta-FeSe [9, 10]. Furthermore, the observation of higher T_{\rm{c}} may be expected because the c of \beta-FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5}, 5.957(1) A [11], is larger than that of \beta-FeSe [5.5229(1) or 5.5234(1) A] [6, 9]. Therefore, it may not be easily explainable that the T_{\rm{c}} in (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{n}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} is lower than the T_{\rm{c}}'s in (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{n}}_{\rm{0.5}}FeSe.

Furthermore, we measured the XRD pattern of (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{n}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} in order to determine the lattice constants and compare them with those of the high-T_{\rm{c}} and low-T_{\rm{c}} phases of (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{0.5}}FeSe. The XRD pattern is shown in Fig. S3 in the Supplemental Material [12]. The Le Bail analysis was performed with the space group (_14/mmm_, No. 139). The lattice constants are a = 3.9822(6) A and c = 17.798(7) A for (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5}. Although the c is slightly larger than that [17.578(5) A] of the high-T_{\rm{c}} phase of (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{a}}FeSe, the T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} (23.5 K) of (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} is much lower than that (T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 46 K) of the high-T_{\rm{c}} phase, indicating that the T_{\rm{c}} cannot be universally scaled by c for all metal-doped FeSe_{1-z}Te_{z} materials, i.e., the T_{\rm{c}} in (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} may be universally scaled by the plane spacing of FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} layers. To explain the low T_{\rm{c}}, we may need to consider additional factors such as structural disorder accompanied by the partial replacement of Se by Te, which may lead to the suppression of a superconducting phase.

Figures 3(b) and 3(c) show the M/H curves of (NH_{3})_{\rm{N}}_{\rm{10.5}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} and (NH_{3})_{\rm{C}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} measured in the ZFC and FC modes as a function of temperature. The T_{\rm{c}} and T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} for (NH_{3})_{\rm{C}}_{\rm{0.5}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} were, respectively, determined to be 26 and 29 K in the ZFC mode, while T_{\rm{c}} = 26 K and T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 27 K in the FC mode. The T_{\rm{c}} and T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} for (NH_{3})_{\rm{C}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} were, respectively, determined to be 17 and 18 K in the ZFC mode, and T_{\rm{c}} = 17 K and T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 18 K in the FC mode. Consequently, the T_{\rm{c}} of Li-doped FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} is the highest among Na-, Li-, and Ca-doped samples (T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 24 K for Na, T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 29 K for Li, and T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 18 K for Ca), in contrast to metal-doped FeSe solids, among which Na-doped FeSe is the highest (T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 46 K for Na, T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}} = 44 K for Li, and T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}}\sim40 K for Ca) [3]. The shielding fractions for (NH_{3})_{\rm{10.5}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} and (NH_{3})_{\rm{C}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} are 80% and 92%, respectively, at 2.5 K. In the M/H curves [Figs. 3(b) and 3(c)], no superconducting phases of \beta-FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} and \beta-FeSe are found. For (NH_{3})_{\rm{Li0.5}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5}, we made only one sample, while for (NH_{3})_{\rm{C}}_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5} four samples were made, and the \langle T_{\rm{c}}\rangle and \langle T_{\rm{c}}^{\rm{onset}}\rangle were determined to be 16(1) and 17

 which is close to the _H_c2 of 16.3 T for FeSe polycrystals [15]. However, the _H_c2 of 17 T is much smaller than the 36.5 T of (NH3),Ba0.4FeSe [3]. The _M_-_H_ plot measured at 5 K is shown in Fig. 4(c), and the _H_c1 at 5 K was determined to be 100 Oe from the expanded plot [inset of Fig. 4(c)]. In this study, we could not evaluate the _H_c1 at 0 K from the _M_-_T_ plots [Fig. 4(a)].

The _M_/_H_-_T_ plots at different pressures are shown in Fig. 5(a), and the drop in the _M_/_H_ plot gradually goes to the left as pressure is applied. The pressure dependence of _T_c for (NH3),Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5 is shown in Fig. 5(b). The _T_c decreases with increasing pressure. As a reference, in Fig. 5(b) the _T_c-_p_ plot of (NH3),Cs0.4FeSe is shown in the graph, as in Fig. 2(c). The _T_c-_p_ plots in both phases show a negative pressure dependence, but the fall of the _T_c-_p_ plot in (NH3),Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5 is more rapid than that of (NH3),Cs0.4FeSe [6]. Saturation is observed in the _T_c-_p_ plot for (NH3),Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5 above 0.6 GPa, in contrast to (NH3),Cs0.4FeSe [6]. When a linear approximation is applied to the _T_c-_P_ plots (0-0.6 GPa) of (NH3),Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5, the _dT_c/_dp_ is approximately -11.7(5) K GPa-1 for (NH3),Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5, while the _dT_c/_dp_ is -4.33(8) K GPa-1 for (NH3),Cs0.4FeSe [6], and -7.7(4) K GPa-1 for (NH3),Na0.5FeSe (in this study). Thus, the _dT_c/_dp_ values, -7.7(4) K GPa-1 and -11.7(5) K GPa-1, for (NH3),Na0.5FeSe and (NH3),Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5 are larger than that that [-4.33(8) K GPa-1] for (NH3),Cs0.4FeSe. Furthermore, it is not clear why saturation is observed in the high-pressure range (0.6 GPa <= p <= 1.0 GPa) of (NH3),Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5, contrary to (NH3),Cs0.4FeSe and (NH3),Na0.5FeSe. The pressure dependence of _T_c in (NH3),Na0.4FeSe0.5Te0.5 in the pressure range above 1 GPa is of interest to clarify the origin of the saturation, and that work is now in progress.

In conclusion, we have succeeded in multiple syntheses of superconducting phases through the intercalation of alkali and alkali-earth metal atoms into FeSe and FeSe0.5Te0.5. A superconducting phase was found in (NH3),Na0.5FeSe, which is a lower _T_c phase than was previously reported [3], indicating the presence of multiple superconducting phases. Furthermore, it has been found that the high-_T_c phase possesses a larger c than that of the low-_T_c phase in (NH3),NaFeSe, consistent with the scaling of _T_c by c in (NH3),_M_x FeSe materials.

  The present report details a successful intercalation of metal atoms into FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5}. The highest T_{\text{c}} found in this study in metal-intercalated FeSe_{1-x}Te_{c}, (z \approx 0) is 26 K (T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} = 29 K) in (NH_{3})_{x}Li_{0.5}FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5}.
