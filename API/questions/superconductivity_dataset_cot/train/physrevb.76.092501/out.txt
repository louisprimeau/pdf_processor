###### Abstract

To shed light on the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in Na_{x}CoO_{2}\cdotyH_{2}O, the Mn doping effects are studied. X-ray absorption spectroscopy verifies that the doped Mn impurities occupy the Co sites and are with a valance close to +4. Impurity scattering by Mn is in the unitary limit that, however, does not lead to strong T_{c} suppression. This absence of the strong impurity effects on T_{c} is inconsistent with the simple picture of a sign-changing order parameter. Coexistence of the s-wave superconducting order parameter and the nodal one is proposed to reconcile all the existing experiments and has been implied by the specific heat experiments.

Na_{x}CoO_{2}\cdotyH_{2}O has stimulated researchers due to its exotic superconductivity, the electronic frustration on the triangular Co lattice, and the characters of the strongly correlated electron systems.[1, 2, 3] There is no doubt that Na_{x}CoO_{2}\cdotyH_{2}O has been recognized as one of the most interesting superconductors since the high-T_{c} superconductor era. Compared with MgB_{2} in which the two-gap feature was concluded within one year of its discovery,[4] Na_{x}CoO_{2}\cdotyH_{2}O appears to be more exotic judged by, for example, the proposed models of its superconductivity (Refs. [5, 6, 7, 8] and references therein). The superconducting order parameter of Na_{x}CoO_{2}\cdotyH_{2}O has remained elusive. On the one hand, almost all the relevant experiments agree on the existence of the nodal lines in the order parameter favoring p- or f-wave pairing, if the crystal and time reversal symmetries are further considered.[9, 10, 11, 12, 13] On the other hand, the decrease in the Knight shift below T_{c} is a strong advocate of s- or d-wave pairing.[12, 13] To gain more insights into the nature of the superconductivity in Na_{x}CoO_{2}\cdotyH_{2}O, the impurity scattering effects could provide one useful venue. Impurity effects on T_{c} have revealed indispensable information about superconductivity in many novel superconductors such as cuprates[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] and Sr_{x}RuO_{4}.[22] The general idea is that impurity potential scattering breaks Cooper pairs in the superconductors with a sign-changing order parameter, while it rarely affects T_{c} of those with a fully gapped s-wave order parameter if the impurity doping does not change the carrier density significantly. To shed light on the crucial issue of the order parameter symmetry, Na_{0.7}Co_{1-x}Mn_{x}O_{2}\cdotyH_{2}O samples were prepared. For the first time, x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) shows that the doped Mn ions indeed occupy the Co sites. However, the unitary impurity scattering by Mn does not lead to strong T_{c} suppression. To reconcile the weak T_{c} suppression by impurities with other experiments, coexistence of s-wave and the unconventional pairings is proposed. This model is further supported by the direct observation from the specific heat C(T) experiments.

Polycrystalline parent compounds of sodium cobalt oxides \gamma-Na_{0.7}Co_{1-x}Mn_{x}O_{2}\cdotyH_{2}O together with rapid heat-up procedure. High purity powders of Na_{2}CO_{3}, Mn_{2}O_{3}, and CoO were _thoroughly_ mixed, ground, and calcined. The resulting powders were immersed in the 3M Br_{2}/CH_{3}CN solution for five days, followed by filtering and thorough washing with CH_{3}CN and de-ionized water. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicated that all parent and hydrated samples were of single phase. To further characterize the samples, XAS [including x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)] was carried out for Mn K and L edges as well as Co K edge. Details of XAS experiments can be found in Refs. [23] and [24]. To ensure the accurate results, T_{c} measurements were carried out, respectively, in two systems (MPMS and PPMS of Quantum Design). Results from two measurement systems and two different batches of samples were all consistent. Resistivity \rho was measured by the standard four-probe method.[25]C(T) was further measured to explore the phase transition at very low temperatures. A detailed description of the C(T) measurements can be found in Ref. [15].

Indeed, there was at least one report on the Ir and Ga impurity effects in Na_{x}CoO_{2}\cdotyH_{2}O.[26] However, whether Ir or Ga impurities occupied the Co sites was not carefully examined. To explore the impurity effects in cobaltates, Na_{x}Co_{1-x}Mn_{x}O_{2}\cdotyH_{2}O seems a natural choice. Layered Alk_{x}MnO_{2}\cdotyH_{2}O (Alk=Li,Na,K) with the triangular MnO_{2} planes was successfully synthesized more than a decade ago.[27, 28] This indicates that the doped Mn ions would favor the Co sites in Na_{x}CoO_{2}\cdotyH_{2}O and do not alter the crystal symmetry, as suggested by XRD. For further characterizations of the doped Mn ions, Fig. 1(a) shows Mn L-edge XANES spectra of Na_{x}Co_{1-x}Mn_{x}O_{2}\cdotyH_{2}O together with those of MnO_{2}, Mn_{2}O_{3}, and MnO. It is clear that all the Mn-doped samples have similar spectra distinct from those of the starting material Mn_{2}O_{3} and two other common manganese oxides. Moreover, judged by the edge energy around 6550 eV in Fig. 1(b), Mn ions in all the doped samples, hydrated or not, have a valence close to +4. The Mn^{4+} state is consistent with the previous suggestion that the valence of Mn in nominal Alk_{x}MnO_{2}\cdotyH_{2}O is close to +4 by the extraction reactions.[27] The first spectroscopic evidence of Mn is provided here for Mn ions on the triangular lattice. Figure 1(c) shows the Fourier transform (FT) amplitudes and profiles of EXAFS data at Co and Mn K edges for Na_{4}Co_{0.99}Mn_{0.01}O_{2}\cdot^{  The results in Fig. 3 are surprising. Previously, the nodal order parameter was detected in Na_{x}CoO_{2}\cdot yH_{2}O_{7}[9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Therefore, T_{c} should have been strongly suppressed by impurity scattering as in the cases of cuprates and Sr_{2}RuO_{4}. For example, dT_{c}/dz=12 K/1% in YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{2})3O_{6.93}[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58,  that two superconducting regimes are separated by a magnetic ordering phase with respect to the Co NQR frequency.[35, 36, 37] These two superconducting phases are suggested to have distinct order parameters.[38] Unless with the well-specified conditions during the process as in Ref. [35], most Na_{x}CoO_{2}\cdot yH_{2}O samples could have two superconducting phases mixed together, manifested by the experiments of the present work. Recently, there have been more theoretical works discussing the multiorder parameters and the related subjects.[38, 39]

Finally, C(T) experiments reveal persuasive evidence supporting the coexistence model. In Fig. 5(a), C(T)/T of Na_{x}CoO_{2}\cdot yH_{2}O is similar to that of Ref. [11] and the anomaly manifests the superconducting phase transition around 4.5 K. In Fig. 5(b), C(T)/T of the doped sample Na_{x}CoO_{0.958}Mn_{0.005}O_{2}\cdot yH_{2}O has a well defined anomaly consistent with T_{c} measured by the M measurements. More strikingly, there occurs another anomaly at lower T (indicated by the arrow) which can be attributed to the second transition due to the nodal order parameter. It is noted that the transition temperature of this anomaly below 2 K is in quantitative agreement with the potential pair-breaking model, as denoted by the dashed line in Fig. 3.

To summarize, Mn impurities have been successfully doped into CoO_{2} planes in Na_{x}CoO_{1-x}Mn_{x}O_{2}\cdot yH_{2}O. Spectroscopy evidence indicates that the doped Mn ions are located on the Co sites. The absence of the strong impurity effects on T_{c} is _inconsistent_ with the simple picture of a sign-changing order parameter. The model of coexistence of s-wave superconducting order parameter and the nodal one is proposed as one of the possible scenarios to reconcile the observed T_{c} suppression rate and the results from other experiments. Cautions should be taken due to the reduction of the superconducting volume in Mn-doped samples.

Figure 5: C(T)/T of (a) Na_{x}CoO_{2}\cdot yH_{2}O and Na_{x}CoO_{0.958}Mn_{0.005}O_{2}\cdot yH_{2}O. The arrow indicates the lower temperature phase transition in addition to that associated with T_{c} by the M measurements.
