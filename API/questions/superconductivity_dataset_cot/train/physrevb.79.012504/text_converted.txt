###### Abstract

We report on anisotropic dc magnetic susceptibility χ(7), electrical
resistivity ρ(7), and heat-capacity C(7) measurements on the single
crystals of CaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂ for x =0 and 0.06. Large-sized single
crystals were grown by the high-temperature solution method with ω as
the solvent. The spin-density wave (SDW)/structural transition observed
at 170 K in the pure CaFe₂As₂ compound is suppressed for the Co-doped
sample CaFe_(1.94)Co_(0.06)As₂ and superconductivity is observed at =17
K. The superconducting transition has been confirmed from the
magnetization and electrical resistivity studies. The ⁵⁷Fe Mossbauer
spectrum in CaFe₂As₂ indicates that the SDW ordering is incommensurate
with the crystal lattice. In the Co-doped sample, a prominent
paramagnetic line at 4.2 K is observed indicating a weakening of the SDW
state.

The discovery of superconductivity at a high transition temperature
T_(c) 26 K in iron-based LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) (Ref. [1]) has created a
torrent of research activities in the field of magnetism and
superconductivity. T_(c) is significantly enhanced in these oxypnictides
both by the application of external hydrostatic pressure [2] (T_(c) 43 K
at 4 GPa) and replacing La with smaller-sized rare-earth ions [T_(c) 43
K in the isostructural compound SmFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) (Ref. [3])]. The
crystal structure of these compounds is characterized by an alternative
stacking of LaO and FeAs layers such as LaO-FeAs-LaO-FeAs, where the Fe
and As atoms are strongly coupled by covalent bond. [2] Although the
oxypnictides possess high superconducting transition temperature,
crystal growth of a sizable amount has not been achieved until recently
to understand the anisotropic physical properties and the nature of
superconductivity. More recently, another class of FeAs-based compounds
AFe₂As₂ (A = Ba, Ca, Sr, and Eu) [4, 5, 6, 7] has been identified in
which superconductivity can be induced either by doping or by applying
hydrostatic pressure. For example, K (hole)-doped
Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ shows a T_(c) as high as 38 K (Ref. [8]) while
Co (electron)-doped BaFe_(1.8)Co_(0.2)As₂ exhibits a superconducting
transition at 22 K. [9] The crystal structure of AFe₂As₂ contains FeAs
layers, similar to oxypnictides, which are separated by the layers of A
atoms. Unlike the oxypnictides, the AFe₂As₂ compounds can be grown in
single crystalline form by high-temperature solution growth method using
either a Fe-As self-flux taking advantage of the Fe-As binary eutectic
or with Sn as flux.

While new results are being reported at a fast pace, to our knowledge,
the results of Co-doped single crystalline CaFe₂As₂ have not been
reported until recently. In this Brief Report, we present our results on
the anisotropic properties of pure and Co-doped single crystals of
CaFe₂As₂. Single crystals of CaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂ (x = 0 and 0.06) were
grown by high-temperature solution growth using Sn as flux. The starting
materials were high-purity metals of Ca, (Fe,Co), As, and Sn taken in
the ratio of 1:2:2:19 for pure compound; for the Co-substituted sample
our starting composition was 1:1.8:0.2:2:19. The contents were placed in
a high-quality recrystallized alumina crucible and subsequently sealed
in an evacuated quartz ampoule. The furnace was slowly heated to 1050
^(∘)C and held at that temperature for 24 h to ensure homogenization. It
was gradually cooled down to 450 ^(∘)C over a period of 3 weeks and then
rapidly brought down to room temperature. The flux was removed by means
of centrifuging. Very-large-sized single crystals with typical
dimensions of 20 x 12 x 0.4 mm³ were obtained. Laue patterns showed that
the c axis is normal to the flat plane of the crystal. The crystals were
silvery white and malleable. Electron probe microanalysis showed that
the composition of the Co-doped single crystal is
CaFe_(1.94)Co_(0.06)As₂.

The phase purity of the single crystalline sample was confirmed by
performing powder x-ray diffraction by grinding a few pieces of the
single crystals. The x-ray pattern can be indexed to the ThCr₂Si₂-type
body-centered tetragonal structure with the space group I4/mmm. The
estimated lattice parameters are a = 3.894 2(8) A and c = 11.746(7) A
for CaFe₂As₂ and a = 3.887 5(1) A and c = 11.687(1) A for
CaFe_(1.94)Co_(0.06)As₂. The lattice parameter of the pure sample is in
agreement with the previously reported values. [7, 8] The Co doping
compresses the c axis by 0.5

Figure 1(a) shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic
susceptibility of CaFe_(1.94)Co_(0.06)As₂ measured in a field of 0.5 T.
For the sake of comparison the corresponding data of CaFe₂As₂ in an
applied field of 5 T are shown in Fig. 1(b). A sharp drop [Fig. 1(b)] in
the magnetic susceptibility at 170 K is a signature of a spin-density
wave (SDW) magnetic ordering associated with the iron moments and a
lattice structural transition in CaFe₂As₂. In this regard our data are
in agreement with earlier reports in the literature. [7, 10, 11] In
particular the magnitude of χ for H∥[001] is nearly the same as of Ni
_et al._[10] The 170 K anomaly has vanished for the Co-doped sample
indicating a suppression of the SDW ordering. However, the
susceptibility of CaFe_(1.94)Co_(0.06)As₂ along [100] shows an anomaly
near 90 K which may arise due to an antiferromagneticlike ordering of
the residual Fe moments. Incidentally we see a similar feature along
[100] around the same temperature in CaFe₂As₂, but not observed by
others, [7, 10, 11] which may imply a reorientation of the Fe

moments. At lower temperatures a sharp drop in the susceptibility near
17 K in CaFe_(1.94)Co_(0.06)As₂, attaining diamagnetic values with the
decrease in temperature, is a signature of a superconducting transition.
The inset of Fig. 1(a) shows the diamagnetic susceptibility, corrected
for the demagnetization factor N for H∥[[001]],[12] along both the
principal directions measured in a field of 0.005 T. The superconducting
volume fraction is found to be (55-60)

The temperature dependence of dc electrical resistivity from 1.8 to 300
K for both pure and Co-doped CaFe₂As₂ single crystals for current
parallel to [100] direction is shown in Fig. 2(a). The magnitude and the
thermal variation in the electrical resistivity of the pure compound are
in agreement with the earlier reports.[7, 10] The sharp increase near
170 K is due to the SDW/structural transition. The upper inset of Fig.
2(a) shows the electrical resistivity measured in 5 and 8 T for the pure
CaFe₂As₂. It is evident that the magnetic field has virtually no effect
on the electrical resistivity and that the SDW ordering is insensitive
to the fields as high as 8 T. Our observation is in conformity with a
similar conclusion arrived earlier by Ni _et al.[10]_ who found the
first-order phase transition at 170 K unaffected by fields as high as 14
T. On the other hand, the electrical resistivity of
CaFe_(1.94)Co_(0.06)As₂ does not show any anomaly at 170 K in accordance
with the susceptibility data presented above. It appears to vary
smoothly across 90 K where the susceptibility along [100] shows an
anomaly as discussed above. At 17 K the electrical resistivity drops
rapidly and becomes zero at lower temperatures. The lower inset of Fig.
2(a) shows the onset of superconducting transition on an expanded scale.
Figure 2(b) shows the temperature dependence of the electrical
resistivity below 50 K of CaFe_(1.94)Co_(0.06)As₂ for the current
parallel to [100] in various applied magnetic fields (H∥[001]). Data
with current and field both parallel to [100] were also recorded and
showed a similar trend. As the field is increased the transition becomes
broader and T_(c) shifts to lower temperature which is a characteristic
feature of a type-II superconductor. It may be noticed that we obtained
a zero resistance state even in an applied field of 8 T, which indicates
a high critical field H_(c2). There is only a marginal change in the
normal state resistivity with applied field.

Using the procedure depicted in the lower inset of Fig.

and 8 T and the lower inset shows the low-temperature part of the

2(a) we can determine the temperature dependence of the upper critical
field H_(c2) which is plotted in Fig. 3. The variation in H_(c2) with
temperature is nearly linear with a negative slope and it does not show
any kind of saturation for fields as high as 14 T. However one can
estimate H_(c2)(0) by using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) (Ref.
13) equation H_(c2)(0) = −0.7T_(c)(dH_(c2)/dT_(c)). The slope
dH_(c2)/dT_(c) is estimated to be −1.82 T/K for H[[100] and −1.43 T/K
for H[[001]. For a T_(c) of 17 K, the upper critical field H_(c2)(0) is
found to be 22 and 17 T for H[[100] and [001] directions, respectively,
as shown by the dotted line in Fig. 3. According to Ginzburg-Landau (GL)
theory, H_(c2) can also be determined by using the formula
H_(c2)=H_(c2)(0)(1−t²)/(1 + t²), where t=T/T_(c) is the reduced
temperature. The solid line in Fig. 3 gives a good fit to the above
equation and H_(c2)(0) value thus determined amounts to 27 and 20 T for
H[[100] and [001] directions, respectively.

These values are slightly larger than that obtained from WHH theory.
Using the expression ξ =Φ₀/2 πH_(c2) for the coherence length, where
Φ₀=2.07 × 10⁻⁷ Oe cm², we infer a coherence length of 40 A.

Figure 4 shows the heat capacity from 1.8 to 300 K of CaFe₂As₂ and
CaFe_(1.94)Co_(0.06)As₂. A sharp peak at 170 K indicates a
first-order-like transition for CaFe₂As₂ similar to the previous
reports. [7, 10] However, in the Co-doped sample the peak at 170 K has
vanished, which is in correspondence with the susceptibility and the
resistivity data. The heat-capacity data vary smoothly across 90 K but
at slightly higher temperatures one can imagine that some kind of
anomaly is present near 110 K. The top inset of Fig. 4 shows the heat
capacity of CaFe_(1.94)Co_(0.06)As₂ below 25 K. The jump at T_(c) is not
discernible from the heat-capacity data. Keeping in view the relatively
broad superconducting transition as seen in both the susceptibility and
resistivity, we believe that the anomaly in the heat capacity at T_(c)
is broadened and submerged in the background phonon contribution. We may
mention here that in Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂, where the superconducting
transition is sharp, the anomaly in the heat capacity at T_(c) is barely
discernible. [14] It may also be noted that the

is absent in the Co-doped sample. The lower inset shows the heat
capacity of CaFe₂As₂ in 0 and 12 T fields. The upper inset shows the
temperature dependence of the heat capacity of CaFe_(1.94)Co_(0.06)As₂
below 25 K.

subspectra at 4.2 K are shown (see text).

value of μ₀H_(c2) estimated by WHH theory and the solid line is
according to Ginzburg-Landau theory (see text for details).

heat capacity of pure and Co-doped samples (main panel) is almost
similar. We infer that the Co doping at x=0.06 level leave the phonon
spectrum virtually unchanged.

We have also measured the heat capacity of CaFe₂As₂ in a field of 12 T
with the field direction parallel to both the crystallographic
directions, namely, [100] and [001] (lower inset of Fig. 4). The
magnetic field has virtually no effect on the SDW transition. It has
been pointed out that in a magnetic field the spin-density wave couples
with bands of opposite spin leaving the nesting unaffected.[15]

The magnetic state of Fe in CaFe₂As₂ and CaFe_(1.94)Co_(0.06)As₂ was
further investigated by recording ⁵⁷Fe Mossbauer spectra at selected
temperatures (Fig. 5). The room-temperature spectra for both samples
were quadrupole split (eqQ/2=0.25 mm/s) paramagnetic lines. In the pure
compound the spectra are hyperfine field split below the SDW transition;
the spectrum at 170 and 4.2 K is fitted to a Hamiltonian consisting of
magnetic and quadrupolar terms. The best fit to the experimental
spectrum was obtained by a superposition of three subspectra with
negligible quadrupole splitting (<0.1 mm/s) corresponding to hyperfine
fields of 10, 7.4, and 2.5 T with weightages of 60

The occurrence of multiple subspectra with widely different hyperfine
fields in the pure compound appears strange as there is only one Fe site
in the crystal structure. One reason could be the possible modulation of
the magnetic structure incommensurate with the crystalline lattice,
giving rise to a hyperfine field distribution as reported in EuPdSb.[16]
An incommensurate spin-density wave order has been proposed as the cause
of inhomogeneous broadening of the ⁷⁵As NMR line in single crystal of
BaFe₂As₂ grown from Sn flux, although the neutron scattering results
find a commensurate order.[17] On the other hand a commensurate SDW
ordering has been reported on a self-flux-grown single crystal of
BaFe₂As₂ from ⁷⁵As NMR measurements.[18] It has been claimed that the
presence of even small amount of Sn in the single crystal can have a
large effect on NMR spectra. While our results indicate an
incommensurate magnetic ordering, neutron diffraction on a single
crystal of CaFe₂As₂ grown using Sn flux reveals a commensurate
ordering.[8] We feel that the nature of SDW ordering needs further
investigation.

Turning our attention to the Co-doped sample, the purely quadrupolar
split, paramagnetic Mossbauer spectrum at room temperature persists down
to about 100 K. At 90 K an additional feature characterized by a
broadening in the wings is observed which progressively increases down
to 4.2 K. Although it can arise due to relaxation effects, the anomaly
at 90 K in the magnetization data suggests a magnetic origin of the
broadening. The spectrum at 4.2 K can be simulated by a superposition of
four subspectra corresponding to magnetic hyperfine fields of 9.5, 7.1,
and 2.7 T with weightages of nearly 20

To conclude, we have grown large-sized single crystals of CaFe₂As₂ and
CaFe_(1.94)Co_(0.06)As₂ by flux method using Sn as flux. Our ⁵⁷Fe
Mossbauer results indicate that the SDW ordering in CaFe₂As₂ is
incommensurate. Co doping at the Fe site reduces the unit-cell volume
marginally and it weakens the SDW ordering and induces superconductivity
at a relatively high temperature of 17 K. The upper critical field is
estimated to be 20 T.
