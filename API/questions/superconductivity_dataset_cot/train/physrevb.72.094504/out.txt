###### Abstract

A study of the pressure effect on the magnetic penetration depth \lambda in polycrystalline MgB_{2} was performed by measuring the temperature dependence of the magnetization under an applied pressure of 0.15 and 1.13 GPa. We found that \lambda^{-2} at low temperature is only slightly affected by pressure [\Delta\lambda^{-2}/\lambda^{-2}=3.1(9) % ], in contrast to cuprate superconductors, where, in the same range of pressure, a very large effect on \lambda^{-2} was found. Theoretical estimates indicate that most of the pressure effect on \lambda^{-2} in MgB_{2} arises from the electron-phonon interaction.

 The sample was first ground and then sieved in order to obtain a small grain size, needed for the determination of \lambda from magnetization measurements. The grain size distribution was measured and shown in the inset of Fig. 2. The hydrostatic pressure was produced in a copper-beryllium piston cylinder clamp, especially designed for magnetization measurements under pressure (see Ref. [20]). The sample was put in a Teflon cylinder and the pressure cell was then filled with fluorinert FC77 as pressure transmitting medium. The sample-to-liquid ratio in the pressure cell is about 1/8, small enough to consider each grain isolated by the other. The low field magnetization measurements (field cooling) were performed with a commercial superconducting quantum interference device.

For fine powders with known grain sizes the magnetic penetration depth can be calculated from the measured magnetization by using the Shoenberg formula,[21] modified for the known grain-size distribution N(R)[22]

\[\chi(T) = - \frac{3}{2}{\int_{0}^{\infty}{\left( {1 - \frac{3\lambda(T)}{R}\coth\frac{R}{\lambda(T)} + \frac{3\lambda^{2}(T)}{R^{2}}} \right)g(R)dR}/}\]

\[{\int_{0}^{\infty}{g(R)dR}},\]

where R is the grain radius and _g_(_R_) = _N_(_R_)_R_3. Any change in _kh_(_T_) due to pressure can be attributed mainly to a change of _l_(_T_), and much less to a change of R. The reducing of R with pressure is taken into account in calculating _l_(_T_), by using the bulk modulus reported in Ref. [6]. The sample was measured at low pressure p_{L} = 0.15 GPa and at the highest pressure available p_{H} = 1.13 GPa. The pressure values were determined from a preliminary calibration measurement, where part of the same sample was measured in the pressure cell together with a small piece of lead.[23] The pressure was detected by measuring the T_{c} shift of lead (T_{c}(0 GPa) = 7.2 K).[24] We found _dT__c_/_dp_ = -1.24(5) K/GPa, in good agreement with previous results.[4] The real zero-pressure measurement could not be performed in the pressure cell, since, in order to seal the cell, at least a small pressure had to be applied.

In Fig. 1 the temperature dependence of the normalized magnetization of MgB2 at p_{L} and p_{H} is shown in the vicinity of T_{c}, together with the zero pressure p_{Z} measurement performed on the same sample in a quartz tube. The _T__c_'s were obtained from the intercept of the linear extrapolations (see Fig. 1): T_{c}(_p__L_) = 38.73(3) K, T_{c}(_p__L_) = 38.66(3) K, and T_{c}(_p__H_) = 37.43(3) K. The magnetization curves shift systematically with increasing pressure toward lower temperature. In the inset of Fig. 1 we show the normalized magnetization as a function of the reduced temperature t = _T_/_T__c_ for p_{L} and p_{H}. The identical temperature dependences for both pressure values indicate the absence of stresses in the sample due to pressure.

From the magnetization the susceptibility was calculated. Because of the unknown mass of the sample in the pressure cell, the susceptibility for the lowest pressure (p_{L} = 0.15 GPa) was normalized at low temperature with the value obtained by measuring the same sample in a quartz tube at zero pressure p_{Z}. To calculate the susceptibility for the high pressure data, we took into account the volume contraction of the sample due to the pressure, by using the bulk modulus estimated in Ref. [6]. The values of \lambda^{- 2} were then calculated using the modified Shoenberg formula [Eq. (1)].

We define the shift of \lambda^{- 2} between two different pressures p_{L} (lower) and p_{H} (higher) at a temperature T as

\[\frac{\Delta\lambda^{- 2}}{\lambda^{- 2}} = \frac{\lambda^{- 2}(p_{H}T) - \lambda^{- 2}(p_{L}T)}{\lambda^{- 2}(p_{L}T)}.\]

Figure 2: (a) \lambda^{- 2} as a function of temperature for p_{Z} = 0 GPa (open circles), p_{L} = 0.15 GPa (filled circles), and p_{H} = 1.13 GPa (open squares). (b) Low temperature region on a larger scale. The error bars for the p_{Z} data are not shown for clarity. The dashed and solid lines are fits to the p_{L} and p_{H} data, respectively, using Eq. (4). Note that the data points are much more dense than what is shown in this figure, since part of them were dropped for clarity.

Figure 1: Field cooled (0.5 mT) normalized magnetization of MgB2 as a function of temperature in the vicinity of T_{c} for p_{Z} (open circles), p_{L} (filled circles), and p_{H} (open squares). The inset shows the full normalized magnetization data for p_{L} and p_{H} as a function of the reduced temperature t = _T_/_T__c_. Note that some of the data points were dropped for clarity.

  The temperature dependences of \lambda^{-2} for p_{L} and p_{H}, are shown in Fig. 2, together with the p_{Z} data measured in the quartz tube. Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain reliable data below 7 K because of a background signal due to lead impurities in the composition of the pressure cell. This background signal is negligible above 7 K. This is demonstrated by the fact that the \lambda^{-2}(T) curves for p_{Z} and p_{L} overlap perfectly for temperatures not too close to T_{c}, where a small pressure shift is present. Therefore, while for the p_{Z} measurement in the quartz tube we show the data down to 2 K, for the p_{L} and the p_{H} measurements we show the data only down to \simeq7 K (see lower panel of Fig. 2). Due to the pressure effect on T_{c}, the curves for p_{L} and p_{H} are clearly distinct at high temperature, but they tend to merge at low temperature. The error bars on \lambda^{-2} [shown in Fig. 2(b)] were determined considering that magnetization measurements are reproducible within \simeq0.5%. The value of \lambda^{-2} for the p_{Z} measurement at the lowest temperature (2.5 K) is in good agreement with that one measured with the muon spin rotation technique on the same sample at zero pressure.[25]

The shift of \lambda^{-2} at the lowest temperature available T\approx 7 K between p_{L}=0.15 GPa and p_{H}=1.13 GPa [see Eq. (2)] is

\[\Delta\lambda^{-2}\lambda^{-2}=2.8(1.1)\%.\] (3)

This result shows that a small pressure effect on \lambda^{-2} is present. The pressure results are summarized in Table 1.

To obtain an estimation of the pressure effect on the zero temperature \lambda^{-2}(0), a fit to the experimental data is needed. It was well established that MgB_{2} is a two band superconductor with two superconducting gaps of different size, the larger one originating from the two-dimensional (2D) \sigma band and the smaller one from the 3D \pi band.[26, 27, 28, 29, 32] Taking this into account, the temperature dependence of \lambda, in the low temperature range, can be written in the form[30]

\[\lambda^{-2}(T)=\lambda^{-2}(0)\Bigg{[}1-w\Bigg{(}\frac{2\pi \Delta_{1}(0)}{k_{B}T}\Bigg{)}^{1/2}\exp\Bigg{(}-\frac{\Delta_{1}(0)}{k_{B}T} \Bigg{)}\] \[-(1-w)\Bigg{(}\frac{2\pi\Delta_{2}(0)}{k_{B}T}\Bigg{)}^{1/2}\exp \Bigg{(}-\frac{\Delta_{2}(0)}{k_{B}T}\Bigg{)}\Bigg{]}.\] (4)

Here, \Delta_{1} and \Delta_{2} are the zero temperature small and large gap associated to the \pi and \sigma bands, respectively, and w =\lambda_{1}^{-2}(0)/\lambda^{-2}(0).

The zero pressure data were then fitted to Eq. (4) up to 22 K. The fit gave the following results: \lambda^{-2}(0) =91.1(2) \mum^{-2}, w=0.23(3); \Delta_{1}=2.3(2) meV, and \Delta_{2} =7.2(4) meV. The estimated gaps are in good agreement with previous results from penetration depth measurements.[30, 31]

Because of the lack of data below 7 K for p_{L} and p_{H}, these data were analyzed with fixed w obtained from the fit to the zero-pressure data. Here it is assumed that w is not affected by pressure up to 1.13 GPa. This assumption will be shown below to be correct by our model calculations [see Eq. (9)]. The other fitting parameters [\lambda^{-2}(0) and the gaps] were left free. As shown by the solid and dashed lines in panel (b) of Fig. 2, the data are well described by Eq. (4). In particular the fitted curve of the p_{L} data (dashed line) follows very well the p_{Z} data below 7 K. This indicates that, although the data for the sample under pressure are limited down to 7 K, that is, above the region where \lambda^{-2}(T) becomes flat, however it is highly reliable that the fitting curve well reproduces the missing data below this temperature. The fit yields for \lambda^{-2}(0): \lambda^{-2}(0)_{p_{L}}=90.9(5) \mum^{-2} and \lambda^{-2}(0)_{p_{H}} =93.7(6) \mum^{-2} (see Table 2). So that the relative shift of \lambda^{-2} at T=0 between p_{L}=0.15 GPa and p_{H}=1.13 GPa is [see Eq. (2)]

\[\frac{\Delta\lambda^{-2}}{\lambda^{-2}}=3.1(9)\%,\] (5)

a value in agreement with the experimental one obtained directly form the data at 7 K [Eq. (3)]. This result indicates

Table 1: Summary of the experimental and theoretical estimations of the pressure shift of \lambda^{-2}.

  that there is a small, but not zero, pressure effect on the magnetic penetration depth in the range p = 0.15-1.13 GPa. Although not zero, this effect found in the MgB_{2} system is much smaller than that one found in the Y124 cuprate superconductor, confirming the different character of electron-phonon coupling in these two systems. A summary of the pressure results are reported in Table I. All the fitting parameters are summarized in Table II. The two gaps show a small decrease with increasing pressure, in agreement with the corresponding decrease of _T__{c}. In Table II we added also the ratio 2D/_k_B_T__{c} calculated for D1 and D2 at each pressure. This ratio appears to be pressure independent within errors.

Now let us turn to discuss how the experimental result (5) may be interpreted in terms of a theoretical model of MgB_{2}. Considering that p_{H} - p_{L}  1 GPa, Eq. (5) indicates that the logarithmic derivative of l ~2(0), d ln l ~2(0)/_dp_, must be positive and of the order of few %/GPa. Since l ~2(0)  \omega_{p}^{2}, where o_{p} is the plasma frequency, then a free electron gas estimate would give only d ln l ~2(0)/_dp_ = 1/_B_  0.65% / GPa, where B = - _dp_/_d_ ln l ~155 GPa is the bulk modulus of MgB_{2},6 and O the volume of the unit cell. Although being positive, the free electron estimate is however about five times smaller than that measured. Let us try then to improve the calculations by considering the band structure effects of MgB_{2}. To this end, let us consider the zero temperature expression of the penetration depth [33]

\[\lambda^{-2}(0) = \frac{e^{2}}{3h\,\pi^{2}c^{2}}{\sum\limits_{n}{\oint_{S_{F}^{n}}{ ds|\mathbf{v}_{n}(s)|}}},\]

where the integral runs over the Fermi surface S_{F}^{n} of the _n_th band (_n_ = s, _p_) and \mathbf{v}_{n}(s) is the corresponding surface bare electron velocity vector. In the following, we use the model of Ref. [34] where the p bands are modeled by a half-torus Fermi surface of area _S__{1} and Fermi velocity _n__{1}, while the s bands are approximated by a cylindrical Fermi surface of area _S__{2} and Fermi velocity _v__{2}. Equation (6) then reduces simply to l ~2(0) = l_{1}^{- 2}(0) + l_{2}^{- 2}(0), where l_{i}^{- 2}(0) \times S_{i}_n__{i} = 1, 2, and

\[\frac{d\,\ln\,\lambda^{- 2}(0)}{dp} = w\frac{d\,\ln\,\lambda_{1}^{- 2}(0)}{dp} + (1 - w)\frac{d\,\ln\,\lambda_{2}^{- 2}(0)}{dp},\]

where w = l_{1}^{- 2}(0)/l ~2(0) = S1_n__{1}/(_S_1_n__{1} + S2_n__{2}) is the parameter introduced in Eq. (4). Within the same approximations, the electron density of states at the Fermi level reads N_{F} = _N__{1} + _N__{2}, where N_{i}  \propto S1_s_/_n__{i} is the partial density of states for the band i = 1, 2. Therefore, since l_{i}^{- 2}(0) \times S_{i}_n__{i} \propto _l__{i} \propto _l__{i} \propto _l__{i} /N_{i}, and considering that _S__{1} and _S__{2} scale as O ~2/23, Eq. (7) reduces to

\[\frac{d\,\ln\,\lambda^{- 2}(0)}{dp} = \frac{1}{3B} - \left[\frac{1 - w + \eta v}{\eta + (1 - \eta)N_{2}/N_{F}}\right]\frac{d\,\ln\,N_{F}}{dp},\]

where we have introduced the parameter e = (_d_ ln _N__{1}/_dp_)/(_d_ ln _N__{2}/_dp_) whose calculated value ranges between e = 1, [35] and e = 0. [36] Hence, by setting d ln _N__F_/_dp__{\simeq} \sim -0.31 % / GPa, [7]w = 0.22, and _N__2_/_N__F__{\simeq} = 0. [47], from Eq. (8) we obtain d ln l ~2(0)/_dp_  0.8 % / GPa or 0.5 % / GPa according to whether e = 0 or e = 1, respectively. By the same token, it can be shown that

\[\frac{dw}{dp} = \frac{w(1 - w)(1 - \eta)}{\eta + (1 - \eta)N_{2}/N_{F}}\frac{d\,\ln\,N_{F}}{dp} \simeq (0 - 0.1)\,\%\,\text{/GPa},\]

confirming that the assumption _dw_/_dp_ = 0 used in obtaining Eq. (5) is sufficiently accurate.

The fact that our estimate Dl ~2/l ~2(0.5-0.8)% does not deviate from the free electron gas result suggests that factors other than band structure should be considered in order to get closer to the measured value reported in Eq. (5). It is then natural to consider the electron-phonon interaction _l__el__  * [9]Email address: dicastro@physik.unizh.ch

###### Abstract

A study of the pressure effect on the magnetic penetration depth \lambda in polycrystalline MgB_{2} was performed by measuring the temperature dependence of the magnetization under an applied pressure of 0.15 and 1.13 GPa. We found that \lambda^{-2} at low temperature is only slightly affected by pressure [\Delta\lambda^{-2}/\lambda^{-2}=3.1(9) % ], in contrast to cuprate superconductors, where, in the same range of pressure, a very large effect on \lambda^{-2} was found. Theoretical estimates indicate that most of the pressure effect on \lambda^{-2} in MgB_{2} arises from the electron-phonon interaction.

 The sample was first ground and then sieved in order to obtain a small grain size, needed for the determination of \lambda from magnetization measurements. The grain size distribution was measured and shown in the inset of Fig. 2. The hydrostatic pressure was produced in a copper-beryllium piston cylinder clamp, especially designed for magnetization measurements under pressure (see Ref. [20]). The sample was put in a Teflon cylinder and the pressure cell was then filled with fluorinert FC77 as pressure transmitting medium. The sample-to-liquid ratio in the pressure cell is about 1/8, small enough to consider each grain isolated by the other. The low field magnetization measurements (field cooling) were performed with a commercial superconducting quantum interference device.

For fine powders with known grain sizes the magnetic penetration depth can be calculated from the measured magnetization by using the Shoenberg formula,[21] modified for the known grain-size distribution N(R)[22]

\[\chi(T) = - \frac{3}{2}{\int_{0}^{\infty}{\left( {1 - \frac{3\lambda(T)}{R}\coth\frac{R}{\lambda(T)} + \frac{3\lambda^{2}(T)}{R^{2}}} \right)g(R)dR}/}\]

\[{\int_{0}^{\infty}{g(R)dR}},\]

where R is the grain radius and _g_(_R_) = _N_(_R_)_R_3. Any change in _kh_(_T_) due to pressure can be attributed mainly to a change of _l_(_T_), and much less to a change of R. The reducing of R with pressure is taken into account in calculating _l_(_T_), by using the bulk modulus reported in Ref. [6]. The sample was measured at low pressure p_{L} = 0.15 GPa and at the highest pressure available p_{H} = 1.13 GPa. The pressure values were determined from a preliminary calibration measurement, where part of the same sample was measured in the pressure cell together with a small piece of lead.[23] The pressure was detected by measuring the T_{c} shift of lead (T_{c}(0 GPa) = 7.2 K).[24] We found _dT__c_/_dp_ = -1.24(5) K/GPa, in good agreement with previous results.[4] The real zero-pressure measurement could not be performed in the pressure cell, since, in order to seal the cell, at least a small pressure had to be applied.

In Fig. 1 the temperature dependence of the normalized magnetization of MgB2 at p_{L} and p_{H} is shown in the vicinity of T_{c}, together with the zero pressure p_{Z} measurement performed on the same sample in a quartz tube. The _T__c_'s were obtained from the intercept of the linear extrapolations (see Fig. 1): T_{c}(_p__L_) = 38.73(3) K, T_{c}(_p__L_) = 38.66(3) K, and T_{c}(_p__H_) = 37.43(3) K. The magnetization curves shift systematically with increasing pressure toward lower temperature. In the inset of Fig. 1 we show the normalized magnetization as a function of the reduced temperature t = _T_/_T__c_ for p_{L} and p_{H}. The identical temperature dependences for both pressure values indicate the absence of stresses in the sample due to pressure.

From the magnetization the susceptibility was calculated. Because of the unknown mass of the sample in the pressure cell, the susceptibility for the lowest pressure (p_{L} = 0.15 GPa) was normalized at low temperature with the value obtained by measuring the same sample in a quartz tube at zero pressure p_{Z}. To calculate the susceptibility for the high pressure data, we took into account the volume contraction of the sample due to the pressure, by using the bulk modulus estimated in Ref. [6]. The values of \lambda^{- 2} were then calculated using the modified Shoenberg formula [Eq. (1)].

We define the shift of \lambda^{- 2} between two different pressures p_{L} (lower) and p_{H} (higher) at a temperature T as

\[\frac{\Delta\lambda^{- 2}}{\lambda^{- 2}} = \frac{\lambda^{- 2}(p_{H}T) - \lambda^{- 2}(p_{L}T)}{\lambda^{- 2}(p_{L}T)}.\]

Figure 2: (a) \lambda^{- 2} as a function of temperature for p_{Z} = 0 GPa (open circles), p_{L} = 0.15 GPa (filled circles), and p_{H} = 1.13 GPa (open squares). (b) Low temperature region on a larger scale. The error bars for the p_{Z} data are not shown for clarity. The dashed and solid lines are fits to the p_{L} and p_{H} data, respectively, using Eq. (4). Note that the data points are much more dense than what is shown in this figure, since part of them were dropped for clarity.

Figure 1: Field cooled (0.5 mT) normalized magnetization of MgB2 as a function of temperature in the vicinity of T_{c} for p_{Z} (open circles), p_{L} (filled circles), and p_{H} (open squares). The inset shows the full normalized magnetization data for p_{L} and p_{H} as a function of the reduced temperature t = _T_/_T__c_. Note that some of the data points were dropped for clarity.

  The temperature dependences of \lambda^{-2} for p_{L} and p_{H}, are shown in Fig. 2, together with the p_{Z} data measured in the quartz tube. Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain reliable data below 7 K because of a background signal due to lead impurities in the composition of the pressure cell. This background signal is negligible above 7 K. This is demonstrated by the fact that the \lambda^{-2}(T) curves for p_{Z} and p_{L} overlap perfectly for temperatures not too close to T_{c}, where a small pressure shift is present. Therefore, while for the p_{Z} measurement in the quartz tube we show the data down to 2 K, for the p_{L} and the p_{H} measurements we show the data only down to \simeq7 K (see lower panel of Fig. 2). Due to the pressure effect on T_{c}, the curves for p_{L} and p_{H} are clearly distinct at high temperature, but they tend to merge at low temperature. The error bars on \lambda^{-2} [shown in Fig. 2(b)] were determined considering that magnetization measurements are reproducible within \simeq0.5%. The value of \lambda^{-2} for the p_{Z} measurement at the lowest temperature (2.5 K) is in good agreement with that one measured with the muon spin rotation technique on the same sample at zero pressure.[25]

The shift of \lambda^{-2} at the lowest temperature available T\approx 7 K between p_{L}=0.15 GPa and p_{H}=1.13 GPa [see Eq. (2)] is

\[\Delta\lambda^{-2}\lambda^{-2}=2.8(1.1)\%.\] (3)

This result shows that a small pressure effect on \lambda^{-2} is present. The pressure results are summarized in Table 1.

To obtain an estimation of the pressure effect on the zero temperature \lambda^{-2}(0), a fit to the experimental data is needed. It was well established that MgB_{2} is a two band superconductor with two superconducting gaps of different size, the larger one originating from the two-dimensional (2D) \sigma band and the smaller one from the 3D \pi band.[26, 27, 28, 29, 32] Taking this into account, the temperature dependence of \lambda, in the low temperature range, can be written in the form[30]

\[\lambda^{-2}(T)=\lambda^{-2}(0)\Bigg{[}1-w\Bigg{(}\frac{2\pi \Delta_{1}(0)}{k_{B}T}\Bigg{)}^{1/2}\exp\Bigg{(}-\frac{\Delta_{1}(0)}{k_{B}T} \Bigg{)}\] \[-(1-w)\Bigg{(}\frac{2\pi\Delta_{2}(0)}{k_{B}T}\Bigg{)}^{1/2}\exp \Bigg{(}-\frac{\Delta_{2}(0)}{k_{B}T}\Bigg{)}\Bigg{]}.\] (4)

Here, \Delta_{1} and \Delta_{2} are the zero temperature small and large gap associated to the \pi and \sigma bands, respectively, and w =\lambda_{1}^{-2}(0)/\lambda^{-2}(0).

The zero pressure data were then fitted to Eq. (4) up to 22 K. The fit gave the following results: \lambda^{-2}(0) =91.1(2) \mum^{-2}, w=0.23(3); \Delta_{1}=2.3(2) meV, and \Delta_{2} =7.2(4) meV. The estimated gaps are in good agreement with previous results from penetration depth measurements.[30, 31]

Because of the lack of data below 7 K for p_{L} and p_{H}, these data were analyzed with fixed w obtained from the fit to the zero-pressure data. Here it is assumed that w is not affected by pressure up to 1.13 GPa. This assumption will be shown below to be correct by our model calculations [see Eq. (9)]. The other fitting parameters [\lambda^{-2}(0) and the gaps] were left free. As shown by the solid and dashed lines in panel (b) of Fig. 2, the data are well described by Eq. (4). In particular the fitted curve of the p_{L} data (dashed line) follows very well the p_{Z} data below 7 K. This indicates that, although the data for the sample under pressure are limited down to 7 K, that is, above the region where \lambda^{-2}(T) becomes flat, however it is highly reliable that the fitting curve well reproduces the missing data below this temperature. The fit yields for \lambda^{-2}(0): \lambda^{-2}(0)_{p_{L}}=90.9(5) \mum^{-2} and \lambda^{-2}(0)_{p_{H}} =93.7(6) \mum^{-2} (see Table 2). So that the relative shift of \lambda^{-2} at T=0 between p_{L}=0.15 GPa and p_{H}=1.13 GPa is [see Eq. (2)]

\[\frac{\Delta\lambda^{-2}}{\lambda^{-2}}=3.1(9)\%,\] (5)

a value in agreement with the experimental one obtained directly form the data at 7 K [Eq. (3)]. This result indicates

Table 1: Summary of the experimental and theoretical estimations of the pressure shift of \lambda^{-2}.

  that there is a small, but not zero, pressure effect on the magnetic penetration depth in the range p = 0.15-1.13 GPa. Although not zero, this effect found in the MgB_{2} system is much smaller than that one found in the Y124 cuprate superconductor, confirming the different character of electron-phonon coupling in these two systems. A summary of the pressure results are reported in Table I. All the fitting parameters are summarized in Table II. The two gaps show a small decrease with increasing pressure, in agreement with the corresponding decrease of _T__{c}. In Table II we added also the ratio 2D/_k_B_T__{c} calculated for D1 and D2 at each pressure. This ratio appears to be pressure independent within errors.

Now let us turn to discuss how the experimental result (5) may be interpreted in terms of a theoretical model of MgB_{2}. Considering that p_{H} - p_{L}  1 GPa, Eq. (5) indicates that the logarithmic derivative of l ~2(0), d ln l ~2(0)/_dp_, must be positive and of the order of few %/GPa. Since l ~2(0)  \omega_{p}^{2}, where o_{p} is the plasma frequency, then a free electron gas estimate would give only d ln l ~2(0)/_dp_ = 1/_B_  0.65% / GPa, where B = - _dp_/_d_ ln l ~155 GPa is the bulk modulus of MgB_{2},6 and O the volume of the unit cell. Although being positive, the free electron estimate is however about five times smaller than that measured. Let us try then to improve the calculations by considering the band structure effects of MgB_{2}. To this end, let us consider the zero temperature expression of the penetration depth [33]

\[\lambda^{-2}(0) = \frac{e^{2}}{3h\,\pi^{2}c^{2}}{\sum\limits_{n}{\oint_{S_{F}^{n}}{ ds|\mathbf{v}_{n}(s)|}}},\]

where the integral runs over the Fermi surface S_{F}^{n} of the _n_th band (_n_ = s, _p_) and \mathbf{v}_{n}(s) is the corresponding surface bare electron velocity vector. In the following, we use the model of Ref. [34] where the p bands are modeled by a half-torus Fermi surface of area _S__{1} and Fermi velocity _n__{1}, while the s bands are approximated by a cylindrical Fermi surface of area _S__{2} and Fermi velocity _v__{2}. Equation (6) then reduces simply to l ~2(0) = l_{1}^{- 2}(0) + l_{2}^{- 2}(0), where l_{i}^{- 2}(0) \times S_{i}_n__{i} = 1, 2, and

\[\frac{d\,\ln\,\lambda^{- 2}(0)}{dp} = w\frac{d\,\ln\,\lambda_{1}^{- 2}(0)}{dp} + (1 - w)\frac{d\,\ln\,\lambda_{2}^{- 2}(0)}{dp},\]

where w = l_{1}^{- 2}(0)/l ~2(0) = S1_n__{1}/(_S_1_n__{1} + S2_n__{2}) is the parameter introduced in Eq. (4). Within the same approximations, the electron density of states at the Fermi level reads N_{F} = _N__{1} + _N__{2}, where N_{i}  \propto S1_s_/_n__{i} is the partial density of states for the band i = 1, 2. Therefore, since l_{i}^{- 2}(0) \times S_{i}_n__{i} \propto _l__{i} \propto _l__{i} \propto _l__{i} /N_{i}, and considering that _S__{1} and _S__{2} scale as O ~2/23, Eq. (7) reduces to

\[\frac{d\,\ln\,\lambda^{- 2}(0)}{dp} = \frac{1}{3B} - \left[\frac{1 - w + \eta v}{\eta + (1 - \eta)N_{2}/N_{F}}\right]\frac{d\,\ln\,N_{F}}{dp},\]

where we have introduced the parameter e = (_d_ ln _N__{1}/_dp_)/(_d_ ln _N__{2}/_dp_) whose calculated value ranges between e = 1, [35] and e = 0. [36] Hence, by setting d ln _N__F_/_dp__{\simeq} \sim -0.31 % / GPa, [7]w = 0.22, and _N__2_/_N__F__{\simeq} = 0. [47], from Eq. (8) we obtain d ln l ~2(0)/_dp_  0.8 % / GPa or 0.5 % / GPa according to whether e = 0 or e = 1, respectively. By the same token, it can be shown that

\[\frac{dw}{dp} = \frac{w(1 - w)(1 - \eta)}{\eta + (1 - \eta)N_{2}/N_{F}}\frac{d\,\ln\,N_{F}}{dp} \simeq (0 - 0.1)\,\%\,\text{/GPa},\]

confirming that the assumption _dw_/_dp_ = 0 used in obtaining Eq. (5) is sufficiently accurate.

The fact that our estimate Dl ~2/l ~2(0.5-0.8)% does not deviate from the free electron gas result suggests that factors other than band structure should be considered in order to get closer to the measured value reported in Eq. (5). It is then natural to consider the electron-phonon interaction _l__el__  * [9]Email address: dicastro@physik.unizh.ch
