###### Abstract

In tetragonal SrCo_{2}As_{2} single crystals, inelastic neutron scattering measurements demonstrated that strong stripe-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations occur at a temperature T = 5 K [Jayasekara _et al._, arXiv:1306.5174] that are the same as in the isostructural AFe_{2}As_{2} (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) parent compounds of high-T_{\rm c} superconductors. This surprising discovery suggests that SrCo_{2}As_{2} may also be a good parent compound for high-T_{\rm c} superconductivity. Here structural and thermal expansion, electrical resistivity \rho, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), heat capacity C_{\rm p}, magnetic susceptibility \chi, ^{75}As NMR, and neutron diffraction measurements of SrCo_{2}As_{2} crystals are reported together with LDA band structure calculations that shed further light on this fascinating material. The c-axis thermal expansion coefficient \alpha_{c} is _negative_ from 7 to 300 K, whereas \alpha_{c} (the a-axis thermal expansion coefficient) is positive over this T range. The \rho(T) shows metallic character. The ARPES measurements and band theory confirm the metallic character and in addition show the presence of a flat band near the Fermi energy E_{F}. The band calculations exhibit an extremely sharp peak in the density of states \mathcal{D}(E\approx E_{F}) arising from a flat d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} band, where the x and y axes are along the a and b axes of the Co square lattice, respectively. A comparison of the Sommerfeld coefficient of the electronic specific heat with \chi(T\to 0) suggests the presence of strong ferromagnetic itinerant spin correlations, which on the basis of the Stoner criterion predicts that SrCo_{2}As_{2} should be an itinerant ferromagnet, in conflict with the magnetization data. The \chi(T) does have a large magnitude, but also exhibits a broad maximum at \approx 115 K suggestive of dynamic short-range AFM spin correlations, in agreement with the neutron scattering data. The measurements show no evidence for any type of phase transition between 1.3 and 300 K and we suggest that metallic SrCo_{2}As_{2} has a gapless quantum spin-liquid ground state.

## 1 Introduction

After the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) below T_{\rm c} = 26 K in tetragonal LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} (1111-type) in 2008,^{1} a worldwide effort began to understand the mechanism for the SC and to discover other Fe-based superconductors. This effort quickly led to the enhancement of T_{\rm c} to its current record among bulk Fe-based superconductors of T_{\rm c} = 56.3 K for the 1111-type compound Gd_{0.8}Th_{0.2}FeAsO.^{2} Additional families of Fe-based high-T_{\rm c} superconductors were soon discovered including the 122-type arsenides where the parent compounds have composition AFe_{2}As_{2} (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu) with the tetragonal ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure (space group 14/mmm).^{3,\ast}^{-}^{5} All families of Fe-based high-T_{\rm c} superconductors contain stacked square lattices of Fe atoms that are identical to the stacked square lattices of Cu atoms in the layered high-T_{\rm c} cuprates.^{3,\ast,\ast,\ast}^{-}^{8}

The 122-type family of iron arsenide-based superconductors is the most studied because large, high-quality single crystals can be grown,^{9} and the parent compounds offer enormous flexibility for chemical substitutions on the A, Fe, and As sites. Crystals with masses \sim1 g can be grown, which allows a broad range of measurements including inelastic neutron scattering measurements to be performed to characterize and understand the properties. It has been demonstrated that the parent compounds at ambient pressure exhibit a lattice distortion to an orthorhombic structure at a system-dependent T_{\rm S}\lesssim 200 K together with long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at the same or somewhat lower Neel temperature T_{\rm N}.^{3,10} The ordering propagation vector is the same as the nesting wave vector between the hole and electron pockets of the semimetallic band structure. This and the low ordered moments^{3,10}\mu\lesssim 1\mu_{\rm B}/Fe indicate an itinerant origin of the AFM^{11,12} rather than arising from interactions between local Fe magnetic moments.

The AFM structure within the ab plane of the Fe square lattice is a so-called "stripe" structure in which ferromagnetically aligned stripes of Fe magnetic moments along the orthorhombic b axis are AFM aligned along the a axis.^{5,10} These orthorhombic axes have the same directions as the respective Fe square lattice a and b axes, which are in turn rotated by 45^{\circ} with respect to the a and b axes of the body-centered tetragonal ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type crystal structure. Furthermore, in order for high-T_{\rm c} SC to occur, this long-range AFM ordering must be largely suppressed by chemical substitutions or pressure, but strong dynamic short-range AFM correlations must still be preserved. These AFM fluctuations/correlations are widely considered to be the glue for the SC Cooper pairs.^{3,11,13,14} A similar phenomenology and temperature-doping phase diagram are found for the high-T_{\rm c} cuprates.^{6,\ast,\ast,\ast,\ast}^{-}^{15}

Among the substituted 122-type materials,^{3} the best studied are Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} with T_{\rm c}\leqslant 38 K,^{16} Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As  with T_{\rm c}\leqslant 25 K [17, 18, 19], and BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} with T_{\rm c}\leqslant 30 K [20]. The detailed temperature-composition phase diagram for Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} with 0\leqslant x\leqslant 0.12 shows, as T\to 0, an AFM region at 0\leqslant x\lesssim 0.03, a region of coexisting AFM and SC for 0.03\lesssim x\lesssim 0.06 and a region of only SC order (the remaining part of the superconducting dome) for 0.06\lesssim x\lesssim 0.12, where T_{\rm c}\to 0 at x\approx 0.12[19]. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements demonstrated that the AFM correlations/fluctuations that are present in the paramagnetic (PM) state of BaFe_{2}As_{2} above T_{\rm N}=136 K (Ref. [21]) are absent in the nonsuperconducting PM composition x=0.14 at 10 K [22], consistent with the hypothesis that AFM spin fluctuations are required as the SC pairing glue in these materials [3, 10].

As might be expected from the latter result, neither magnetic susceptibility [18]\chi(T) nor neutron diffraction [23] measurements on SrCo_{2}As_{2} showed any evidence for long-range magnetic ordering above 1.8 and 4 K, respectively. This is the same result as found for isostructural BaCo_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [24]) but is in contrast to the magnetic behavior of CaCo_{2}As_{2}, which shows A-type AFM ordering below a sample-dependent T_{\rm N} of 53 to 76 K [25, 26, 27]. The ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type crystal structure of SrCo_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [28]) is shown in Fig. 1(a).

The As-As interlayer distance d_{\rm As-As} [see Fig. 1(a)] is correlated with the magnetic ground state [29], where a "layer" is defined as an As-M-As layer and M is the transition metal, as shown in Fig. 1(b). CaCo_{2}As_{2} with an AFM ground state has a collapsed tetragonal (cT) structure reflecting approach to interlayer As-As dimerization, where the As-As single-covalent-bond distance [30] is indicated in Fig. 1(b), whereas BaCo_{2}As_{2} with a PM ground state has an uncollapsed tetragonal (T) structure without such dimerization. SrCo_{2}As_{2} also has a PM ground state and is in an intermediate regime [29], as seen in Fig. 1(b). This correlation between the magnetic behavior and the crystal structure contrasts with that of the 122-type AF_{2}As_{2} compounds where the cT structure of CaFe_{2}As_{2} has a nonmagnetic ground state and the T structures of the Ca, Sr, and Ba compounds all have AFM ground states [3, 29, 31, 32, 33]. Interlayer As-As dimerization in the cT phase results in a valence of As^{-2}, i.e., [As-As^{-4}, instead of the usual As^{-3} valence in the 122-type (Ca, Sr, Ba)M_{2}As_{2} compounds, corresponding to a formal M oxidation state of M^{+1} instead of the usual M^{+2}. From Fig. 1(b), SrCo_{2}As_{2} may be in a regime with intermediate Co oxidation state between Co^{+1} in CaCo_{2}As_{2} and Co^{+2} in BaCo_{2}As_{2}. This intermediate valence state, in turn, might be expected to result in strong dynamic Co spin fluctuations in SrCo_{2}As_{2}.

In view of the disappearance of dynamic AFM correlations in the PM state of the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} system as x increases from x=0 to 0.14 [21, 22], it is amazing that strong AFM stripe-type correlations are present in the x=1 end-member SrCo_{2}As_{2} of the similar series Sr(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} (Refs. [34, 35, 36]) as established from inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single crystals [23]. The above-noted intermediate valence of the Co in SrCo_{2}As_{2} may be responsible for the lack of long-range AFM order, at least in part. The presence of these AFM correlations in SrCo_{2}As_{2} raises key questions about how they come about in this compound, why this compound is not superconducting, and whether it could be made superconducting by some type of chemical substitution or by application of pressure.

Here we report the investigation of undoped SrCo_{2}As_{2} single crystals using x-ray and neutron diffractions, in-plane (ab-plane) electrical resistivity \rho, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), heat capacity C_{\rm p}, magnetization M, \chi, and ^{75}As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, complemented by LDA band structure calculations. Experimental and theoretical details are given in Sec. II. The x-ray diffraction investigations of crushed crystals in Sec. III yield a structure in agreement with previous work. The \rho(T) measurements in Sec. IV demonstrate metallic character, consistent with the ARPES measurements in Sec. V, which also indicate that there is no obvious significant Fermi surface

  nesting. The band theory calculations in Sec. VI reveal a sharp and high peak in the density of states near the Fermi energy \mathcal{D}(E\approx E_{\rm F}). The C_{\rm p} measurements in Sec. VII further confirm the metallic character and confirm the presence of a large \mathcal{D}(E\approx E_{\rm F}). The M and \chi measurements in Sec. VIII show clear evidence for dynamic short-range AFM spin correlations in a quasi-low-dimensional spin lattice, consistent with the inelastic neutron scattering results.[23] The NMR measurements are presented in Sec. IX, which indicate the presence of stripe-type and/or FM correlations. The x-ray diffraction, \rho, C_{\rm p}, \chi, and NMR measurements reveal no obvious phase transitions between 1.3 and 300 K, in agreement with the previous[23] and present neutron diffraction measurements in Sec. X. In Sec. XI, we discuss the ground state of metallic SrCo_{2}As_{2} and suggest that this compound has a gapless quantum spin-liquid ground state. A summary and our conclusions are given in Sec. XII.

## II Experimental and theoretical details

Single crystals of SrCo_{2}As_{2} were grown from solution using Sn flux. In the Fe-based high-T_{\rm c} superconductivity field, Sn flux was first used by Ni _et al._ to grow crystals of BaFe_{2}As_{2} and Ba_{0.55}K_{0.45}Fe_{2}As_{2}.[37] High-purity elements Sr (99.95%) from Sigma-Aldrich, and Co (99.998%), As (99.9999%), and Sn (99.999%) from Alfa Aesar, were taken in 1:2:2:45 ratio and placed in an alumina crucible that was sealed in an evacuated silica tube. After prereacting the elements at 610 degC for 5 h, the assembly was heated to 1150 degC, left here for 8 h and then slowly cooled to 700 degC in 160 h. At this temperature, the flux was decanted using a centrifuge. The typical size of the crystals obtained was 2\times 2\times 0.3 mm^{3}. However, by increasing the size of the crucible to a 10 mL capacity, large crystals of SrCo_{2}As_{2} with masses up to \approx 1 g with dimensions up to 15\times 10\times 1 mm^{3} can be grown out of Sn flux.[23]

The chemical compositions of the crystals were determined by energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX) using a JEOL-JSM-5910LV scanning electron microscope and found to be in agreement with the expected stoichiometric composition SrCo_{2}As_{2}. These EDX measurements showed no visible peaks at the expected positions of the Sn x-ray emission lines, and the amount of Sn incorporated into the crystals from the Sn flux was given by the software as 0.22(16) at%, which is consistent with zero to within 1.3\sigma. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that a very small amount of Sn was incorporated into the crystals, which might have had some influence on the results of our physical property measurements. For comparison, BaFe_{2}As_{2} crystals grown in Sn flux contain \sim1 at% Sn as determined using wavelength-dispersive x-ray analysis,[37] which results in large changes in the physical properties such as in a reduction of the tetragonal to orthorhombic structural transition temperature from 136 K in pure crystals grown out of FeAs self-flux as discovered by Wang _et al.[38]_ to the value of 85 K in the crystals grown out of Sn flux by Ni _et al.[37]_

Structural characterization was performed using room-temperature powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) data obtained on crushed crystals using a Rigaku Geigerflex powder diffractometer and Cu-K_{\alpha} radiation. Rietveld refinement of the XRD data was carried out using the fullprof package.[39] The M(H), \chi, C_{\rm p}, and four-probe \rho measurements were performed using instruments from Quantum Design, Inc. In the M(H), \chi, and C_{\rm p} measurements, the contribution of the sample holder was measured separately and corrected for in each case.

A high-resolution x-ray powder diffraction pattern was collected at ambient temperature at the beamline X16C at the National Synchrotron Light Source. The sample was ground with an agate mortar and pestle in a glovebox having a water vapor concentration of a few parts per million, loaded into a glass Lindemann capillary of 0.3-mm nominal diameter, and flame-sealed without exposure to the atmosphere. The x-ray wavelength, 0.6995 A, was chosen using a Si(111) double monochromator. The powder diffraction pattern was collected in the 5-45^{\circ}2\theta range with a constant step size of 0.005^{\circ}, and a linearly varying counting time of 1-3 s/point. The incident beam intensity was monitored with an ion chamber and the diffracted radiation was measured with a NaI(Tl) scintillation detector. The axial and in-plane resolution of the diffractometer were set by slits and a Ge(111) analyzer crystal, respectively. Rietveld refinement of the x-ray diffraction pattern was done using the gsas[40] package.

High-resolution single-crystal x-ray diffraction measurements were performed on a four-circle diffractometer using Cu-K_{\alpha 1} radiation from a rotating anode x-ray source, selected by a Ge(111) monochromator. For measurements of the temperature dependence of the lattice parameters, a platelike single crystal, with the tetragonal c axis perpendicular to the plate, was attached to a flat copper sample holder on the cold finger of a He closed-cycle displex refrigerator. The sample was oriented such that the (h0\ell) plane or the (hh\ell) plane of the reciprocal lattice was coincident with the scattering plane of the diffractometer.

Single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements were done on the TRIAX triple-axis spectrometer at the University of Missouri Research Reactor employing an incident neutron energy of 14.7 meV. A platelike crystal of mass 302.4 mg was mounted on the cold finger of a closed-cycle displex refrigerator with the (h0\ell) plane of the reciprocal lattice coincident with the scattering plane of the diffractometer, allowing us to search for magnetic scattering at the reciprocal lattice positions for the A-type AFM structure [(h0\ell) with h+\ell=2n+1], as found previously for CaCo_{2}As_{2},[27] and the G-type AFM structure [(h0\ell) with h and \ell odd], as found for the related compound BaMn_{2}As_{2}.[41]

High-resolution ARPES experiments were carried out using a Scienta R4000 electron analyzer and 140-eV photon energy at beamline 7.0.1 of the Advanced Light Source (ALS), Berkeley, California. The crystals were cleaved _in situ_ along the ab plane and measured at a pressure of \approx 4\times 10^{-11} mbar. The energy and momentum resolution were set to \sim 20 meV and \sim 0.3^{\circ}, respectively. The Fermi energy (E_{\rm F}) of the sample was referenced to that of a gold sample deposited _in situ_ on the sample holder. In our notation, the Brillouin zone (BZ) of SrCo_{2}As_{2} is that of the body-centered-tetragonal (I4/mmm) direct lattice and not that of the Co square lattice, and the (k_{x},k_{y},k_{z}) axes of the Brillouin zone are, as conventionally defined in the literature, in the directions of the direct lattice translation vectors (**a**,**b**,**c**), respectively.[3]

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements were carried out on ^{75}As (l=3/2, \gamma_{\rm N}/2\pi=7.2919 MHz/T) using a homemade phase-coherent spin-echo pulse spectrometer.

  ^{75}As-NMR spectra were obtained by sweeping the magnetic field H at a fixed frequency f=51.1 MHz. The magnetic field was applied parallel to either the crystal c axis or the ab plane. The origin of the NMR shift K=0 of the ^{75}As nucleus was determined by ^{75}As NMR measurements of GaAs. The ^{75}As nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T_{1}) was measured with a saturation recovery method.

For electronic structure calculations, we used the full-potential linear augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) [42] method with the local density approximation (LDA). [43] To obtain self-consistent charge and wave functions, we employed R_{\rm MT}\times k_{\rm max}=9.0 with muffin-tin radii R_{\rm MT}=2.3, 2.1, and 2.1 a.u. for Sr, Co, and As, respectively. 828 **k** points were selected in the irreducible Brillouin zone and calculations were iterated to reach the total energy convergence criterion, which was 0.01 mRy/cell, where a "cell" is a primitive cell containing one formula unit of five atoms. Our experimental lattice parameters in Table 1 for the I4/mmm structure of SrCo_{2}As_{2} (a=3.9471 A, c=11.801 A) were used in the calculations. To obtain the theoretical c-axis position z_{\rm As} of the As atom, its position was relaxed until the force on the As atom was smaller than 1 mRy/a.u., which gave z_{\rm As}=0.35146. This value is somewhat smaller than our experimental value z_{\rm As}=0.3588(1) in Table 1.

## III Crystallography and thermal expansion

### Powder x-ray diffraction: crystal structure

The laboratory-based powder XRD data for SrCo_{2}As_{2} are shown in Fig. 2(a), along with the two-phase Rietveld refinement fit including a fit to the adventitious Sn from the flux on the surface of the crystals prior to crushing them, the difference profile and Bragg positions for the main phase as well as for Sn. The parameters fitted during the refinement were the lattice parameters, As c-axis position parameter z_{\rm As}, isotropic thermal parameters, scale factor, zero shift, three resolution parameters, profile shape parameter, and asymmetry parameters. The Sn impurity phase fraction was found to be 4.9 wt%. The site occupancies of Sr, Co, and As were kept fixed at 100% during the final refinement cycle because allowing the occupancies to vary from this value did not improve the fit significantly. The lattice parameters and z_{\rm As} are listed in Table 1 along with the corresponding literature data for CaCo_{2}As_{2}

Figure 2: (Color online) Room-temperature powder XRD data for SrCo_{2}As_{2} along with the Rietveld refinement fit, Bragg peak positions, and difference profile from (a) a laboratory-based diffractometer with x-ray wavelength \lambda=1.5418 Å and (b) a synchrotron-based diffractometer with x-ray wavelength \lambda=0.6995 Å. A two-phase Rietveld refinement was performed to account for the peaks from a minor amount of Sn flux on the surfaces of each of the two crushed-crystal samples.

Table 1: Crystal data for ACo_{2}As_{2} (A= Ca, Sr, Ba) compounds that crystallize in the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure with I4/mmm space group symmetry and Z=2 formula units/unit cell. The A atoms are at the 2a (0 0 0) sites, the Co atoms at the 4d (0 \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) sites, and the As atoms at the 4e (0 0 z_{\rm As}) sites. For the laboratory-based measurements, the goodness of fit parameters are \chi^{2}=1.19, R_{\rm p}=7.08%, and R_{\rm np}=9.34%, whereas for the synchrotron-based measurements, they are \chi^{2}=1.08, R_{\rm p}=12.47%, and R_{\rm np}=16.67%. The designations “T” and “C” refer to the uncollapsed tetragonal and collapsed tetragonal structures, respectively. SrCo_{2}As_{2} has c/a and d_{\rm As-As} values intermediate between those of T-type BaCo_{2}As_{2} and cT-type CaCo_{2}As_{2}.

  SrCo_{2}As_{2}, and BaCo_{2}As_{2}.[27, 28, 29] Our data for SrCo_{2}As_{2} are in reasonable agreement with those of Ref. [28].

The synchrotron x-ray diffraction pattern for SrCo_{2}As_{2}, the Rietveld profile refinement fit and residuals are displayed in Fig. 2(b). Here again, an impurity phase of adventitious Sn flux, comprising in this sample approximately 1% of the sample by weight, was included in the refinement of the powder diffraction pattern. A small section of low-angle data was removed from the refinement due to poor statistics. Several very low-intensity peaks could not be identified conclusively with other impurity phases. Table 1 gives a summary of the results of the refinement of the powder XRD data for the SrCo_{2}As_{2} phase. These data are in good agreement with those found above from the laboratory-based x-ray diffraction measurements.

Single-crystal x-ray diffraction: thermal expansion and search for a temperature-induced orthorhombic distortion

The T dependencies of the a and c lattice parameters were extracted from the positions of the (2 0 8) and (0 0 8) Bragg peaks measured by single-crystal x-ray diffraction as described in Sec. II. Figure 3(a) shows a striking _decrease_ in the c lattice parameter by approximately 0.3% as T_increases_ from our base temperature of 7.4 to 300 K, corresponding to a negative thermal expansion coefficient along the c axis over the full T range of the measurement. In contrast, the a lattice parameter _increases_ by \approx 0.35% with increasing T over the same T interval, which corresponds to the usual positive thermal expansion coefficient. The volume thermal expansion in Fig. 3(b) initially decreases on heating above 8 K and then increases from \approx 80 K to room temperature.

Negative thermal expansion coefficients in the paramagnetic states of materials are unusual. Indeed, the anisotropic thermal expansion coefficients above the coupled structural and magnetic transitions in crystals of the AFe_{2}As_{2} high-T_{\rm c} parent compounds [44] and in Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} crystals with x= 0.038 and 0.074 (Ref. [45]) are all positive. On the other hand, Ca_{1-x}La_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} crystals with x= 0.15, 0.20, and 0.25 all show temperature regions where the a- and/or c-axis and volume expansion coefficients are negative.[46] These latter behaviors are suggested by the authors to originate from proximity to a structural phase transition.

Our thermal expansion data in Fig. 3 reveal no obvious evidence for a temperature-induced lattice distortion in SrCo_{2}As_{2}. We therefore specifically searched for an orthorhombic lattice distortion, using high-resolution single-crystal x-ray diffraction, that might be associated with the observed negative c-axis and volume thermal expansion coefficients. However, no splitting or changes of peak shape were observed in the temperature range 10-300 K for the (2 0 8) or (1 1 8) reflections measured in the (h 0 \ell) and (h h \ell) scattering planes, respectively, demonstrating that no tetragonal to orthorhombic lattice distortion occurs over this T range to within an estimated upper limit for a potential distortion of (a-b)/(a+b) \leqslant 2.5 \times 10^{-4}.

## IV Electrical resistivity

Figure 4 shows the ab-plane \rho(T) of SrCo_{2}As_{2}. The data exhibit metallic behavior with a high residual resistivity ratio RRR \equiv\rho(300 K)/\rho(3 K) = 15.3, indicating good crystal quality. At low temperatures (3.5 K \leqslantT\leqslant 38 K), we find that \rho(T) follows \rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{2} (inset of Fig. 4) as expected for a Fermi liquid.[47] A fit by this equation gives \rho_{0}=12.0\mu\Omega cm and A= 8.21(4) \times 10^{-3}\mu\Omega cm/K^{2}.

The data over the entire T range could not be fitted well solely by the sum of a T-independent term \rho_{0} and the Bloch-Gruneisen prediction for carrier scattering by longitudinal lattice vibrations in the absence of umklapp scattering given by [48, 49]

\[\rho_{\rm{BG}}(T)=4{\cal R}\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{\rm{R}}}\right)^{5}\int_{0} ^{\Theta_{\rm{R}}/T}\frac{x^{5}}{(e^{x}-1)(1-e^{-x})}\,dx,\] (1a) where \[\Theta_{\rm{R}}\] is the Debye temperature obtained from fitting resistivity measurements and \[{\cal R}\] is a material-dependent scale

  factor that is independent of T. Equation (1a) yields

\[\rho(T=\Theta_{\rm R})\approx 0.946\,464\,{\cal R}.\] (1b)

At high temperatures T\gtrsim\Theta_{\rm R}, the BG model yields a \rho_{\rm BG}(T) that is proportional to T, whereas the experimental data in Fig. 4 show negative curvature at high T. Therefore we also used a Mott interband sd scattering term -DT^{3} (Refs. [50, 51]) to fit the data according to

\[\rho(T)=\rho_{0}+\rho_{\rm BG}(T)-DT^{3}.\] (1c)

This fit function is not accurate at low T because the data below 38 K follow a T^{2} dependence as shown in the inset of Fig. 4 and discussed above, whereas \rho_{\rm BG}(T) has a T^{5} dependence at low T. Furthermore, we used the high-accuracy analytic dimensionless Pade approximant \rho_{\rm n}(T/\Theta_{\rm R}) in Ref. [48] in place of Eq. (1a) to facilitate the least-squares fit to the data, where

\[\rho_{\rm BG}(T)=\rho(\Theta_{\rm R})\rho_{\rm n}(T/\Theta_{\rm R}).\] (1d)

A good fit of the experimental \rho(T) data in Fig. 4 by Eq. (1) was obtained (black curve in Fig. 4), where the fitted parameters are \rho_{0}=13.3(1)\mu\Omega cm, \rho(\Theta_{\rm R})=104(1)\mu\Omega cm, \Theta_{\rm R}=167(1) K, and D=9.1(1)\times 10^{-7}\mu\Omega cm K^{-3}. From the value of \rho(\Theta_{\rm R}) and Eq. (1b), we obtain {\cal R}=110\mu\Omega cm. A significant contribution from the Mott sd interband scattering is expected in materials where narrow d bands appear at the Fermi level, for example in elemental Pd metal. [50] Since the ARPES data and the band structure calculations presented below show that an extremely narrow d band is present at E_{\rm F} in SrCo_{2}As_{2}, a substantial contribution from Mott sd interband scattering is not surprising.

## V Arpes

We studied the electronic properties of a SrCo_{2}As_{2} single crystal using high-resolution ARPES, which can directly probe the low-energy electronic excitations as a function of binding energy and momentum. Figure 5(a) shows the photoemission intensity map, which is obtained by integrating over an energy window of \pm 10 meV with respect to the Fermi energy E_{\rm F}, measured with a photon energy of 140 eV and sample temperature of 90 K. We clearly see four patches of intensity arranged around the center (\Gamma point) of the Brillouin zone (BZ), which are located at \pm\pi/a along the k_{x} and k_{y} directions. More interesting is the observation of a large {\bf k}-independent intensity near E_{\rm F} along the [\pm 1,\pm 1] directions passing through the corners (X points) of the BZ. This indicates the presence of a flat band near E_{\rm F} that extends over a large fraction of the second BZ. Our LDA band structure calculations in Fig. 8(c) below confirm the presence of a flat d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} band situated at or very close to E_{\rm F} that passes through the X points in the [\pm 1,\pm 1] directions, where here the x and y axes are along the a and b axes of the Co square lattice, respectively. A wide flat band just above E_{\rm F} with an associated very sharp peak in the density of states was also present in previous LDA band calculations for KCo_{2}As_{2}. [52]

Energy distribution curves (EDCs) for fixed momenta moving along the white line at the top of Fig. 5(c) are shown in Fig. 6(a), and an enlargement of the EDC in bold blue in Fig. 6(a) is plotted in Fig. 6(b). This shows in more detail a large and sharp peak in the quasiparticle density of states at E_{\rm F} as expected from the flat band near E_{\rm F} and associated sharp peak in the density of states identified in the band structure calculations. We speculate that the anomalous c-axis thermal expansion behavior and perhaps some of the magnetic properties we observe for SrCo_{2}As_{2} are driven by the presence of this flat band at or near E_{\rm F}.

In general, this Fermi surface (FS) is very different from those of other related parent compounds of the 122 family like BaFe_{2}As_{2} and SrFe_{2}As_{2}, where the hole FSs at \Gamma and the electron FSs at X are roughly circular in shape and similar in size. [53] To gain more insight about the character of the FS pockets, in Figs. 5(b) and 5(c) we show the energy-momentum ARPES intensity maps along two different cuts, marked by the white [across the \Gamma (0,0) point] and black [across the X (\pi/a,-\pi/a) point] bars in Fig. 5(a). In Fig. 5(b), one can

Figure 5: (Color online) (a) The Fermi surfaces of SrCo_{2}As_{2} measured with 140 eV photon energy and at 90 K sample temperature. The photoemission intensity maps are obtained by integrating over an energy window of \pm 10 meV with respect to the Fermi level. The outline of the first Brillouin zone (BZ) is shown by the white dashed square. (b) Band dispersion data plotted through the center [\Gamma point, horizontal white line in (a)] of the BZ from {\bf k}=(\sim-\pi/a,0) to (\sim\pi/a,0) and (c) through the corner [X point (\pi/a,-\pi/a), black line in (a)] of the BZ described by {\bf k}=(\frac{\pi}{a},-\frac{\pi}{a})+{\bf k}_{a}, where {\bf k}_{a}=(k_{x},k_{x}) and k_{a} ranges from zero to \approx\pm 1.2\pi/a. The black vertical arrows at the tops of (b) and (c) denote the Fermi wave vector positions for the electron Fermi surface pockets centered at \Gamma and X, respectively.

  observe a rather weak but discernible electron-like FS pocket at the \Gamma point and two additional small electron pockets at \pm\pi/a. A general observation in Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} is that with increasing x (electron doping), the central hole pockets at \Gamma become electron-like, while the X pockets remain electron-like and keep expanding on the overdoped side of the phase diagram (see, e.g., the ARPES data for the x=0.42 sample in Ref. [54]). An electron pocket at the center of the BZ [Fig. 5(b)] for SrCo_{2}As_{2} is expected and is in overall agreement with our previous study of Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2}.[54] The pocket at the X point is also electron-like, but much larger in size [Fig. 5(c)], so there is no obvious Fermi surface nesting in SrCo_{2}As_{2}.

We extracted the Fermi momenta of the electron pockets from the peaks in the momentum distribution curves at E_{\rm F} (not shown), and were found to be about +0.2 A^{-1} [vertical black arrows at the top of Fig. 5(b)] and \pm 0.7 A^{-1} [vertical black arrows at the top of Fig. 5(c)] centered at the \Gamma and X points, respectively. Figure 5(b) also shows that the top of the hole band at the \Gamma point has moved from above E_{\rm F} for the AFe_{2}As_{2} compounds to about 400 meV below E_{\rm F} due to Co contributing one conduction electron more than Fe. This leads to the disappearance of the hole-like Fermi surface around the \Gamma point as discussed above[54] and is consistent with our recent ARPES study of BaCo_{2}As_{2}.[55] In particular, the energies of the top and bottom of the valence band at the \Gamma and X points, the size of the electron pockets surrounding the \Gamma point, and the location and extent of the flat band at the X point are very similar for both materials.

## VI Band structure calculations

The top and bottom panels of Fig. 7 are atom- and orbital-decomposed densities of states (DOS), which were calculated with 1631 **k** points in the irreducible BZ. The top panel shows strongly hybridized bonding states between Co and As atoms in the energy range from 3 to 6 eV below E_{\rm F}. There are also antibonding empty states but they are located outside of the energy range shown. It also shows, near E_{\rm F}, a strong peak,

Figure 6: (Color online) (a) Energy distribution curves (EDCs) at fixed wave vector as the wave vector is scanned through the \Gamma point along the white bar at the top of Fig. 5(c), which is from k_{u}=0.52\,\pi/a to 1.19\,\pi/a. The EDC highlighted in bold blue is at k_{u}=0.85\,\pi/a. The Fermi energy E_{\rm F} is at the zero of energy on the horizontal scale. (b) Enlargement of the EDC at k_{u}=0.85\,\pi/a that is plotted in bold blue in (a). The sharp quasiparticle peak near E_{\rm F} arises from a flat electron band with a sharp peak in the density of states near E_{\rm F}.

Figure 7: (Color online) (Top panel) Total and atom-decomposed density of states (DOS) of SrCo_{2}As_{2} versus energy E. (Bottom panel) Orbital-decomposed contributions of the Co 3d atoms to the DOS. The peak in the total DOS near E_{\rm F}=0 is mostly contributed by the Co atoms. The DOS shows three peaks in the energy range shown. The peak near E_{\rm F} is mainly from the d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} flat-band component, and the second peak near 1.2 eV below E_{\rm F} is from the d_{xz}, d_{yz} components, which are degenerate in tetragonal symmetry. The third peak near 1.5 eV below E_{\rm F} is from the d_{xy} and d_{z^{2}} components. The ordinate scales of the DOS are different in the two panels because the top panel is for all atoms whereas the bottom panel is for the Co atoms separately.

  which is mostly of Co d character. It is well known that a system that has a high DOS or peak at E_{\rm F} is unstable and has a tendency to split the peak (lower the total energy) via physical transformations such as magnetic or structural transitions.[56] Therefore it might be expected that SrCo_{2}As_{2} also shows peculiar temperature- or pressure-dependent properties, which depend on the precise peak position.

The bottom panel of Fig. 7 shows the orbital-decomposed Co atom DOS in a small energy range (from 2 eV below to 1 eV above E_{\rm F}) to emphasize the orbital contributions to the peak near E_{\rm F}. The d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} orbital points towards neighboring Co atoms in the xy plane and is a dominant contributor, where the x and y axes are defined here to be along the a and b axes of the Co square lattice, respectively. It suggests a possibility to control the peak size or position by Co-Co distance modification.

Thus the very sharp peak in the DOS near E_{\rm F} in Fig. 7(a) arises from a Co d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} flat band extending over a large fraction of the second BZ. The band structure density of states at E_{\rm F} is

\[\mathcal{D}^{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})=11.04\;{\rm states/(eV\;f.u.)}\;{\rm both\; spins}.\] (2)

Figure 8 shows a Fermi surface (FS) plot and band structures for three different cuts in **k** space. For the Fermi surface calculation, we divided the -2\pi/a<k_{x}, k_{y}<2\pi/a range of k_{x},k_{y} planes with different k_{z} values into a 200\times 200 mesh that gives 40401 **k** points. Figure 8(a) shows the result with k_{z}=1.88(\pi/c) and also shows three cutting lines for band structure calculations. The cutting line #1 is from (-2\pi/a,0,z) to (2\pi/a,0,z), #2 is from (0,-2\pi/a,z) to (2\pi/a,0,z), and cutting line #3 is from (-2\pi/a,2\pi/a,z) to (2\pi/a,2\pi/a,z), with z=1.88(\pi/c). These cutting lines #1-#3 correspond to the band structure plots Figs. 8(b)-8(d), respectively. Figure 8(c) shows the d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} flat band that is largely responsible for the sharp high peak in the DOS near E_{\rm F}.

## VII Heat capacity

The C_{\rm p} of SrCo_{2}As_{2} is plotted versus T in Fig. 9. The value of C_{\rm p} at 240 K is 124 J/mol K, which is close to the Dulong-Petit high-T limit of the lattice heat capacity at constant volume given by C_{\rm V}=15R\approx 124.7\;{\rm J/mol\;K}, where R is the molar gas constant. The inset in Fig. 9 shows a conventional C_{\rm p}/T versus T^{2} plot for T\leqslant 10 K where the data are fitted by the expression

\[C_{\rm p}/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4},\] (3)

which is the sum of electronic (\gamma T) and low-T lattice (\beta T^{3}+\delta T^{5}) heat capacity contributions. The fitted values of

Figure 8: (Color online) Plots of (a) the Fermi surface and (b)–(d) the band structure of SrCo_{2}As_{2} calculated at k_{z}=1.88(\pi/c). The lines (#1-#3) in (a) are cutting lines for band structure plot directions and correspond to panels (b)–(d), respectively. The lattice parameters a and c are those of the body-centered tetragonal unit cell of SrCo_{2}As_{2} given in Sec. II.

  the Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma and the lattice coefficients \beta and \delta are listed in Table 2. The value of \gamma = 37.8(1) mJ/mol K2 is very large compared to those of the parent iron arsenide compounds AFe_{2}As_{2} (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) in the stripe AFM state.[57, 58, 59] Additional C_{\rm p}(T) data at H = 3 T down to 1.3 K revealed no new features (not shown).

The density of states at the Fermi energy for both spin directions \mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F}), including many-body enhancement effects due to the electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions, is calculated from

\[\gamma=\frac{\pi^{2}k_{\rm B}^{2}}{3}\mathcal{D}^{\gamma}(E_{\rm F}).\] (4)

Using the above value of \gamma yields

\[\mathcal{D}^{\gamma}(E_{\rm F})=16.0(3)\;{\rm states}/{\rm eV}\,{\rm f}.{\rm u}.\] (5)

for both spin directions. This value is 1.45 times the band theory value of 11.04 states/(eV f.u.) (see Table 2). Writing \gamma=\nu_{\rm band}(1+\lambda_{\rm el-ph})m^{*}/m_{\rm band}, where \gamma_{\rm band} and m_{\rm band} are the band theory values of \gamma and the current carrier effective mass, \lambda_{\rm el-ph} is the electron-phonon coupling constant and m^{*}/m_{\rm band} is the electronic many-body conduction carrier mass enhancement over the band theory value, gives

\[(1+\lambda_{\rm el-ph})m^{*}/m_{\rm band}\approx 1.45.\] (6)

A similar analysis of \gamma obtained at low T has been done for paramagnetic BaCo_{2}As_{2}, where the authors find[24]

\[\gamma = 41.0\;{\rm mJ/mol\,K^{2}},\] (7a) \[\mathcal{D}^{\gamma}(E_{\rm F})=17.4\;{\rm states/eV}\,{\rm f}.{ \rm u}.,\] (7b) \[(1+\lambda_{\rm el-ph})m^{*}/m_{\rm band}\approx 2.0.\] (7c)

The \gamma and \mathcal{D}^{\gamma}(E_{\rm F}) values of SrCo_{2}As_{2} and BaCo_{2}As_{2}, respectively, are seen to be nearly the same. The difference between the combined electron-phonon and electronic mass enhancements in Eqs. (6) and (7c) arises mainly from the difference in the band structure densities of states of the two compounds.

The Debye temperature \Theta_{\rm D} is obtained from the value of \beta according to

\[\Theta_{\rm D}=\left(\frac{12\pi^{4}Rn}{5\beta}\right)^{1/3},\] (8)

where \beta is normalized to a mole of formula units (f.u.) and n = 5 is the number of atoms per f.u. Thus we obtain \Theta_{\rm D} = 251(1) K. This value is much larger than the value \Theta_{\rm R} = 167(1) K obtained above in Sec. IV from the Bloch-Gruneisen fit to \rho(T). This discrepancy may be associated with the unusual negative thermal expansion characteristics discussed in Sec. III.2 above and/or with T-dependent spin fluctuation effects discussed in Sec. IX below and associated magnetoelastic coupling effects.

The Kadowaki-Woods (KW) ratio is R_{\rm KW} = A/\gamma^{2} = 5.7 x 10^{-3} m\Omega cm mol^{2} J^{-2} K^{2}, similar to those observed in strongly-correlated electron metals and heavy fermion compounds,[60] thus suggesting the presence of strong electron correlations in SrCo_{2}As_{2}.

The C_{\rm p}(T) data in the entire T range of measurement were fitted by

\[C_{\rm p}(T)=\gamma\,T+n\,C_{\rm V\,Debye}(T),\] (9a) where \gamma was fixed at the above-determined value 37.8 mJ/mol K2 and n = 5 is the number of atoms/f.u. The function C_{\rm V\,Debye}(T) is the Debye lattice heat capacity at constant volume per mole of atoms due to acoustic phonons given by[61]

\[C_{\rm V\,Debye}(T)=9\,R\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{\rm D}}\right)^{3}\int_{0}^{ \Theta_{\rm D}/T}\frac{x^{4}e^{x}}{(e^{x}-1)^{2}}\,dx,\] (9b)

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c}  & SrCo_{2}As_{2} & BaCo_{2}As_{2} \\ Parameter & (This work) & (Refs. [24] and [63]) \\ \hline \gamma (ml/mol K2) & 37.8(1) & 41.0 \\ \beta (ml/mol K4) & 0.611(7) & 0.47 \\ \delta (\muJ/mol K6) & 1.01(9) & \\ \mathcal{D}^{\gamma}(E_{\rm F})^{\alpha} & 16.0(3) & 17.4 \\ \mathcal{D}^{\gamma}(E_{\rm F})^{\alpha} & 54 & 90 \\ R  where \Theta_{\rm D} is the Debye temperature. A high-accuracy analytic Pade approximant[48] for the Debye function in Eq. (9b) was used for fitting the C_{\rm p}(T) data, which greatly facilitates the fit. The \Theta_{\rm D} derived from the least-squares fit of the data over the full T range in Fig. 9 by Eq. (9a) is 304(3) K as listed in Table 2. This value of \Theta_{\rm D} is significantly larger than the value of 251(1) K determined above from fitting the C_{\rm p} data at low T<10 K by Eq. (3). Furthermore, the goodness of fit obtained is poor, evident from the large systematic deviations of the fit from the data in Fig. 9 compared to the much better fits we recently obtained for other 122-type compounds.[27, 48] This unusually large deviation between the two \Theta_{\rm D} values might be related to the negative thermal expansion reported in Sec. III.2 and/or magnetoelastic coupling effects arising from strongly T-dependent spin fluctuations. The parameters of the above fits and derived quantities are summarized in Table 2.

## VIII Magnetization and Magnetic Susceptibility

The isothermal magnetization M of a SrCo_{2}As_{2} single crystal versus H for H\parallel c and H\parallel ab plane are shown in Figs. 10(a) and 10(b), respectively. The M is proportional to H for the entire T and H ranges of the measurements for both field directions, showing that the crystal does not contain detectable ferromagnetic (FM) or saturable PM impurities. Therefore the susceptibility can be defined at arbitrary field H as \chi=M(H)/H.

The anisotropic magnetic susceptibilities \chi_{ab} and \chi_{c} of SrCo_{2}As_{2} in H=3 T are plotted versus T in Fig. 11, where \chi_{c}\equiv\chi(H\parallel c) and \chi_{ab}\equiv\chi(H\parallel ab plane). The \chi(T) data for both field directions exhibit broad maxima at \approx 115 K followed by shallow minima at \approx 20 K and smooth low-T upturns below 20 K, with no evidence for long-range magnetic ordering. A very similar broad maximum in \chi at about the same temperature was observed for isostructural KFe_{2}As_{2}.[62] The maximum in \chi(T) for that compound was attributed to a crossover from a coherent to an incoherent Fermi liquid state with increasing T.[62]

The T dependences of the ^{75}As NMR Knight shift K(T) data in Fig. 16(a) below are in overall agreement with the \chi(T) data in Fig. 11, except that the K(T) data do not show the upturns seen in the \chi(T) data below \approx 20 K. This difference indicates that these upturns in \chi(T) are not intrinsic and therefore likely arise from paramagnetic impurities or defects that are not saturable in our field range (see Fig. 10). The Knight shift data from Fig. 16(a) are therefore scaled onto the respective low-T\chi(T) data in Fig. 11 as shown by the solid curves, which represent the intrinsic \chi(T) at low T. The intrinsic values for SrCo_{2}As_{2} at 4.3 K are found to be

\[\chi_{c}(0) = 1.61\times 10^{-3}\;\rm cm^{3}/mol,\] (10a) \[\chi_{ab}(0) = 1.82\times 10^{-3}\;\rm cm^{3}/mol,\] (10b) \[\chi_{\rm P}(0) = 1.75\times 10^{-3}\;\rm cm^{3}/mol,\] (10c)

where the powder-averaged susceptibility \chi_{\rm P} is

\[\chi_{\rm P}=\tfrac{1}{3}\chi_{c}+\tfrac{2}{3}\chi_{ab}.\] (10d)

Figure 11: (Color online) Anisotropic magnetic susceptibility \chi=M/H versus temperature T (where M is magnetization and H is applied magnetic field) of SrCo_{2}As_{2} measured at H=3 T. From our NMR Knight shift measurements in Fig. 16(a) below, the upturns in \chi(T) below about 20 K are not intrinsic. The solid curves are these Knight shift data scaled onto the low-T\chi(T) data, allowing estimates of the intrinsic \chi(T\to 0) values to be obtained as given in Eq. (10). Inset: Fit of the powder-averaged susceptibility \chi_{P} versus T for 200 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K by the Curie-Weiss law in Eq. (20) with \chi_{0}=0 (Fit 1 in Table 2). Fits 1 and 2 are indistinguishable on the scale of the inset.

Figure 10: (Color online) Isothermal magnetization M of SrCo_{2}As_{2} versus applied magnetic field H at the indicated temperatures for H parallel to (a) the c axis and (b) the ab plane.

  The effective density of states at E_{\rm F} for both spin directions {\cal D}^{x}(E_{\rm F}) obtained from magnetic susceptibility measurements is calculated from \chi_{\rm P}(0) for g=2 using the expression

\[\chi_{\rm P}(0)=\mu_{\rm B}^{2}{\cal D}^{x}(E_{\rm F}),\] (11)

yielding a large density of states

\[{\cal D}^{x}(E_{\rm F})=54\;{\rm states}/({\rm eV}\;{\rm f.u.}).\] (12)

The anisotropy in \chi is small with \chi_{ab}(0) slightly larger than \chi_{c}(0). The sign of the anisotropy is opposite to that in the PM state of CaCo_{2}As_{2} (Refs. [25] and [26]) and in BaCo_{2}As_{2}.[24, 63]

For comparison, from the high-field slopes from 2 to 6.5 T of the M(H) data for BaCo_{2}As_{2} at T=1.8 K in the inset of Fig. 1 of Ref. [24], we obtain [63]

\[\chi_{c}(0) = 3.28\times 10^{-3}\;{\rm cm}^{3}/{\rm mol},\] (13a) \[\chi_{ab}(0) = 2.72\times 10^{-3}\;{\rm cm}^{3}/{\rm mol}\;({\rm BaCo}_{2}{ \rm As}_{2}),\] (13b) \[\chi_{\rm P}(0) = 2.91\times 10^{-3}\;{\rm cm}^{3}/{\rm mol}.\] (13c)

These values are \sim 70\% larger than our respective values at 4.3 K for SrCo_{2}As_{2} in Eq. (10). The density of states calculated from \chi_{\rm P}(0) for BaCo_{2}As_{2} using Eq. (11) is

\[{\cal D}^{x}(E_{\rm F})=90\;{\rm states}/({\rm eV}\;{\rm f.u.})\quad({\rm BaCo }_{2}{\rm As}_{2}).\] (14)

### Stoner enhancement and the Wilson ratio: a conundrum

In an itinerant picture, the Stoner-enhanced susceptibility at {\bf q}=0 and T=0 is [64]

\[\chi=\frac{\chi_{0}}{1-{\cal D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})I/4}\equiv\frac{\chi_{0}} {1-F},\] (15)

where \chi_{0} is the conduction carrier spin susceptibility calculated from the band-structure density of states at E_{\rm F} as in Eq. (11), I\sim 0.8 eV is the Stoner factor for Co (Ref. [24]) and the factor of 1/4 arises due to the presence of two Co atoms per f.u. and from the two spin directions counted in {\cal D}(E_{\rm F}). Using {\cal D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})=11.04\;{\rm states}/({\rm eV}\;{\rm f.u.}) from Eq. (2) and I=0.8 eV gives

\[F=2.2>1,\] (16)

which from comparison with Eq. (15) indicates that SrCo_{2}As_{2} should have a FM ground state. This inference is wrong because it strongly disagrees with our M(H) and \chi(T) data in Figs. 10 and 11, respectively.

The Wilson ratio R_{\rm W} is defined as

\[R_{\rm W}\equiv\frac{{\cal D}^{x}(E_{\rm F})}{{\cal D}^{\gamma}(E_{\rm F})}.\] (17)

Within an itinerant picture, if R_{\rm W}\sim 1-2, \chi and \gamma are approximately equally enhanced above the band structure prediction, indicating that any enhancement of \chi and \gamma is due to a many-body enhancement of {\cal D}(E_{\rm F}). On the other hand, if R_{\rm W}\gg 1 or R_{\rm W}\ll 1, one would infer that strong FM or AFM conduction spin correlations are present, respectively, which change \chi but not \gamma.[65] Using the values of {\cal D}^{x}(E_{\rm F}) and {\cal D}^{\gamma}(E_{\rm F}) in Eqs. (12) and (5), respectively, Eq. (17) gives

\[R_{\rm W}=3.5\quad{\rm for}\quad{\rm SrCo}_{2}{\rm As}_{2}.\] (18)

As discussed above, this large value of R_{\rm W} indicates a significant FM enhancement of \chi, qualitatively consistent with the large value of the factor F derived above.

These indications of dominant FM correlations between the itinerant current carriers in SrCo_{2}As_{2} are at odds with the broad maximum in \chi(T) at about 115 K in Fig. 11, which instead suggests the dominance of low-dimensional AFM correlations, [7] and with the linear M(H) behaviors in Fig. 10 that show no tendency towards saturation. Indeed, inelastic neutron scattering measurements on this compound showed strong AFM fluctuations at the stripe AFM wave vector,[23] but preliminary searches for FM spin fluctuations in the first BZ yielded no detectable signal. On the other hand, electronic structure calculations of the static \chi({\bf q}) showed enhancements at both the FM and stripe AFM wave vectors.[23] Interestingly, enhancements of \chi({\bf q}) at the same two wave vectors are found from electronic structure calculations and \chi measurements of the FeAs-based materials.[3, 31]

A similar analysis of \chi and C_{\rm p} data for isostructural BaCo_{2}As_{2} yielded a similar conclusion about the importance of FM itinerant spin correlations in this compound.[24] Using the densities of states for BaCo_{2}As_{2} in Eqs. (7b) and (14), one obtains the value of the Wilson ratio from Eq. (17) as

\[R_{\rm W}=5.2\quad{\rm for}\quad{\rm BaCo}_{2}{\rm As}_{2}.\] (19)

This value is larger than for SrCo_{2}As_{2} in Eq. (18), suggesting stronger FM correlations in this compound. The authors of Ref. [24] suggested that the suppression of long-range FM order in BaCo_{2}As_{2} results from strong spin fluctuations associated with a nearby quantum critical point.

### Curie-Weiss model

Above \approx 200 K, the \chi(T) of SrCo_{2}As_{2} resembles a Curie-Weiss-like (CW) behavior

\[\chi=\chi_{0}+\frac{C}{T-\theta_{\rm p}}.\] (20)

The values of the Curie constant C and Weiss temperature \theta_{\rm p} obtained by fitting \chi_{\rm P}(T) between 200 and 300 K, assuming \chi_{0}=0 (Fit 1), are listed in Table 3. In a second fit, the \chi_{0} value was allowed to vary, yielding a different set of fit parameters (Fit 2) in Table 3. Fit 1 is shown as the red curve in the inset of Fig. 11; both fits to the data are equally good and cannot be distinguished on the scale of the inset. In a local-moment

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c} Parameter & Fit 1 & Fit 2 \\ \chi_{0} (10^{-4}cm^{3}/mol) & \equiv 0 & -4(2) \\ C (cm^{3} K/mol) & 0.65(1) & 1.0(2) \\ g & 1.86(2) & 2.3(2) \\ \mu_{\rm eff}(\mu_{\rm B}/Co) & 1.61(2) & 2.0(2)  model, the Curie constant per mole of spins is given by

\[C = \frac{N_{\rm A}g^{2}S(S + 1)\mu_{\rm B}^{2}}{3k_{\rm B}},\]

where _N_A is Avogadro's number, g is the spectroscopic splitting factor (_g_ factor), S is the spin quantum number, _m_B is the Bohr magneton, and _k_B is Boltzmann's constant. The corresponding effective magnetic moment is computed from

\[\mu_{\rm eff} = g\sqrt{S(S + 1)}\,\mu_{\rm B}/{\rm Co}.\]

The calculated values of g and _m_eff for the two fits taking S = 1/2 are given in Table 3.

For an interacting local moment Heisenberg model \mathcal{H} = \sum_{\left\langle ij \right\rangle}J_{i}\mathbf{S}_{i} \cdot \mathbf{S}_{j} for identical crystallographically equivalent spins, one has [66]

\[\theta_{\rm p} = - \frac{S(S + 1)}{3k_{\rm B}}\sum_{j}J_{ij},\]

where the sum is over all interacting neighbors j of a given spin i. Within the J1-_J_2 model for the square Co lattice where J1 and J2 are the four nearest- and four next-nearest-neighbor exchange interactions, respectively, and using S = 1/2, one obtains

\[\theta_{\rm p} = - \frac{J_{1} + J_{2}}{k_{\rm B}}.\]

Our _th_p values then give

\[\frac{J_{1} + J_{2}}{k_{\rm B}} = 102(7)\,\,\,{\rm K}\quad({\rm Fit}\,\,1),\]

\[\frac{J_{1} + J_{2}}{k_{\rm B}} = 180(50)\,\,\,{\rm K}\quad({\rm Fit}\,\,2),\]

which are strongly antiferromagnetic. We emphasize that the values of C, _m_eff, _th_p, and J1 + J2 may be in error because the CW fit to the _kh_(_T_) data may not have been done at sufficiently high temperatures for the CW law to accurately describe the data, and/or because SrCo2As2 may be an itinerant magnetic system instead of a local-moment one.

The results of _kh_(_T_) measurements on a polycrystalline SrCo2As2 sample were reported earlier by Leithe-Jasper _et al._[18] The authors found that SrCo2As2 is a CW paramagnet showing no magnetic ordering above 1.8 K with C = 0.53 cm3 K/mol and _th_p = -29 K. These C and |_th_p| values are both significantly smaller than our values in Table 3 for a single crystal, and these authors did not report observing the maximum in _kh_(_T_) that we observe at 115 K in Fig. 11 for both field orientations and therefore which also occurs for the polycrystalline average.

### Interconfigurational fluctuation (ICF) model

As discussed above, in an itinerant picture one expects SrCo2As2 and BaCo2As2 to be ferromagnetic. The observed absence of ferromagnetism in these compounds suggests that strong spin fluctuation effects prevent the occurrence of long-range FM ordering, perhaps due to proximity to a quantum critical point.[24] The observed broad maximum in _kh_(_T_) in Fig. 11 and the large magnitude of _th_p in Table 3 can then be analyzed within a phenomenological interconfigurational fluctuation (ICF) model where the average fluctuating valence of the magnetic ions in a material is _T_-dependent.[67, 68] For this model, at high T we find a CW-like _kh_(_T_) with a negative (AFM-like) Weiss temperature, as observed, which conflicts with the positive (FM-like) Weiss temperature expected if SrCo2As2 were near a FM instability. A many-body theory of intermediate-valence and interconfigurational fluctuation effects [69] has been applied to understand the _T_-dependent local moment [70] and associated anomalous T dependence of _kh_ (Ref. [3]) in the PM states of the iron arsenides.

The ICF model is derived from the _kh_ of an isolated two-level local-moment magnetic system. Here we apply it to local-moment _d_-electron systems with quenched orbital angular momentum (_L_z = 0). Spin-orbit coupling generally causes a deviation of g from the free-electron value g = 2 and the introduction of a paramagnetic Van Vleck orbital susceptibility. The ground state has energy E0 = 0, spin S0, and Zeeman degeneracy 2S0 + 1, and the excited state has energy E1, spin S1, and degeneracy 2S1 + 1. The spin susceptibility of this two-level system is then

\[\chi_{\rm two\mbox{-}level}(T) = P_{0}\chi_{0}(T) + P_{1}\chi_{1}(T),\]

where the probabilities of occupying state 0 or 1 are given by the Boltzmann distribution as

\[P_{i} = \frac{(2S_{i} + 1)e^{- E_{i}/k_{\rm B}T}}{(2S_{0} + 1) + (2S_{1} + 1)e^{- E_{i}/k_{\rm B}T}}\quad(i = 0,1).\]

The susceptibilities of the two levels are given by Curie laws as

\[\chi_{i}(T) = \frac{C_{i}}{T}\quad(i = 0,1)\]

with Curie constants

\[C_{i} = \frac{N_{\rm A}g_{i}^{2}S_{i}(S_{i} + 1)\mu_{\rm B}^{2}}{3k_{\rm B}}\quad(i = 0,1).\]

The phenomenological ICF susceptibility _kh_CF is derived from the above results for an isolated two-level system by making the replacement

\[T \to T^{\star}\]

in Eqs. (26), where [68]

\[T^{\star} = \sqrt{T^{2} + T_{\rm sf}^{2}}\quad({\rm model}\,\,1)\]

or [67]

\[T^{\star} = T + T_{\rm sf}\quad({\rm model}\,\,2)\]

and _T_sf is an effective spin fluctuation temperature that reflects the frequency of fluctuations in the spin state of the magnetic ion between S0 and S1.

We fitted our experimental _kh_(_T_) by

\[\chi(T) = \chi_{0} + \chi_{\rm ICF}(T),\]

where _kh_0 is the _T_-independent orbital susceptibility and _kh_ICF is the ICF spin susceptibility. We tried the combinations (_S_0,S1) = (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2,1), and (1, 2), but only the combination (_S_0,S1) = (0, 1) gave a satisfactory fit to the experimental data, for which Eqs. (26) and (27) yield

\[P_{1}(T) = \frac{3}{3 + e^{E_{1}/k_{\rm B}T}}\quad(S_{0} = 0,\,S_{1} = 1)\]  and, using \chi_{0}(T)=0 because S_{0}=0,

\[\chi_{\rm ICF}(T)=\frac{3C_{1}}{(3+e^{E_{1}/k_{\rm B}T})T^{*}}\quad(S_{0}=0,\,S_{ 1}=1).\] (29b)

Using the expression for T^{*} for model 1 in Eqs. (27), a high-T series expansion of Eq. (29b) gives

\[\chi_{\rm ICF}(T) = \frac{C_{\rm ICF}}{T}\bigg{[}1-\frac{E_{1}/k_{\rm B}}{4T}\] (29c) \[-\frac{(E_{1}/k_{\rm B})^{2}+8T_{\rm sf}^{2}}{16T^{2}}+{\cal O} \bigg{(}\frac{1}{T^{3}}\bigg{)}\bigg{]},\]

where

\[C_{\rm ICF}=\frac{3C_{1}}{4}\] (29d)

and T_{\rm sf} first appears in the third term. The factor of 3/4 arises because in the limit of high T the probability of occupying the triplet excited state is 3/4. In this limit, Eq. (29c) yields a Curie law

\[\chi_{\rm ICF}(T)=\frac{C_{\rm ICF}}{T},\] (29e)

where C_{\rm ICF} is the Curie constant of the two-level system at high T. Expanding the first two terms in Eq. (29c) in a Taylor series according to 1+x\approx 1/(1-x) gives a Curie-Weiss-like behavior

\[\chi_{\rm ICF}(T)=\frac{C_{\rm ICF}}{T-\theta_{\rm ICF}}\quad(T\gg\theta_{\rm ICF }),\] (29f)

where the Weiss temperature is

\[\theta_{\rm ICF}=-\frac{E_{1}}{4k_{\rm B}}\quad(\rm model\ 1)\] (30a) with a negative sign (AFM-like). It is interesting that this expression for \[\theta_{\rm ICF} in model 1 does not contain the ICF parameter \[T_{\rm sf}\] . Carrying out the same steps for model 2 gives a Curie-Weiss law ( 29f) with the same Curie constant but a different Weiss temperature \[\theta_{\rm ICF}=-\bigg{(}\frac{E_{1}}{4k_{\rm B}}+T_{\rm sf}\bigg{)}\quad( \rm model\ 2),\] (30b)

which for this model does contain T_{\rm sf}.

The values of the fitted parameters \chi_{0}, E_{1}, T_{\rm sf}, and g_{1} for models 1 and 2 using (S_{0},S_{1})=(0,1) are listed in Table 4 and the fits by the two models are shown in Fig. 12. Also listed in Table 4 are the values of C_{1}, C_{\rm ICF}, and \theta_{\rm ICF} derived from these parameters using Eqs. (26d), (29d), and (30), respectively. Although good fits are obtained using both models, the \chi_{0} value for the fit by model 2 is unphysically large and negative and even the value for model 1 is unusually negative. Furthermore, the values of C_{\rm ICF} and \theta_{\rm ICF} are much closer to the Curie-Weiss fit values in Table 3 for model 1 compared to model 2. However, we only expect the fitting parameters to be semiquantitative because the ICF model is phenomenological.

  for model 1 and the parameters in Table 4. Our thermal expansion measurements in Fig. 3(a) show that SrCo_{2}As_{2} exhibits anomalous negative thermal expansion along the c direction and positive thermal expansion in the basal plane, which results in a a/c ratio that is T dependent and increases with increasing T with a dependence similar to that in Fig. 13 [see Fig. 3(c)]. Thus the T dependence of a/c and the population P_{1}(T) are correlated within this model.

### J_{1}-J_{2} Heisenberg model with S=1/2

#### iii.4.1 Introduction

It is well known that low-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnets exhibit a \chi(T) that has a broad maximum due to the increasing dynamic short-range AFM correlations on cooling below the temperature of the maximum, in conjunction with the suppression of long-range AFM order due to quantum fluctuations associated with the low spin-lattice dimensionality.[7] In view of the inelastic neutron scattering results that demonstrated the occurrence of dynamic stripe-type AFM correlations in SrCo_{2}As_{2},[23] we consider in this section a description of our \chi(T) data in Fig. 11, which show a broad maximum, in terms of the J_{1}-J_{2} Heisenberg model for the two-dimensional (2D) spin-1/2 square lattice. Due to the Mermin-Wagner theorem,[71] a 2D Heisenberg spin lattice cannot exhibit static long-range AFM order at finite T. This result is due to fluctuation affects associated with the low dimensionality of the spin lattice. However, even weak interlayer coupling can induce long-range AFM order, but usually at a temperature significantly below the temperature of the broad peak in \chi(T).[72]

The J_{1}-J_{2} Heisenberg model with spins S=1/2 on a square lattice is well studied. The Hamiltonian in zero field is

\[{\cal H}=\sum_{\langle ij\rangle}J_{1}{\bf S}_{i}\cdot{\bf S}_{j}+\sum_{\langle ik \rangle}J_{2}{\bf S}_{i}\cdot{\bf S}_{j},\] (31)

where the first sum is over nearest-neighbor spin pairs along the legs of the square lattice and the second sum is over next-nearest-neighbor spin pairs along the diagonals of the squares, where positive J_{1} and J_{2} correspond to AFM interactions and negative ones to FM interactions. A stripe-type AFM phase as observed in the LaFeAsO and AFe_{2}As_{2} compounds occurs classically for J_{2}>0 and J_{2}/|J_{1}|>1/2, where J_{1} can be either positive (AFM) or negative (FM).[3] Early in the Fe-based high-T_{c} superconductivity field, this (effective) frustration model was used to explain the stripe-type AFM ordering observed in the 1111-type and 122-type iron arsenides in both the itinerant[73] and local moment[74] descriptions of the magnetism. The same stripe-type AFM ordering is predicted from band theory without reference to exchange interactions.[11, 12]

Our recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements on SrCo_{2}As_{2} indicate the presence of stripe-type AFM correlations with J_{1}<0 and J_{2}/J_{1}\approx-1,[23] which is consistent with the above classical constraints for stripe-type AFM correlations, and further indicated that the correlations are quasi-two-dimensional. We therefore proceed to analyze our \chi(T) data for SrCo_{2}As_{2} in terms of the frustrated 2D J_{1}-J_{2} spin-1/2 Heisenberg square lattice model.

#### iii.4.2 Determining J_{1} and J_{2} from \chi(T) data

In order to estimate the values of the exchange constants J_{1} and J_{2}, one can fit \chi(T) by the high-T series expansion (HTSE) for the spin susceptibility of this model which is given for J_{1}<0 and J_{2}>0 by[75]

\[\frac{\chi|J_{1}|}{Ng^{2}\mu_{\rm B}^{2}}=\frac{|J_{1}|}{k_{\rm B}T}\sum_{n=0 }^{9}\left(\frac{-|J_{1}|}{k_{\rm B}T}\right)^{n}\sum_{m=0}^{n}c_{m,n}\left( \frac{J_{2}}{J_{1}}\right)^{m},\] (32)

where N is the number of spins and a table of the c_{m,n} values is given in Ref. [75]. For a given value of J_{2}/J_{1}, we converted the sum over n into a Pade approximant {\cal P}[p,q] with [p,q]=[4,4], which is a ratio of two fourth-order polynomials in |J_{1}|/k_{\rm B}T (p=q=4), where the coefficients of the two polynomials are solved for exactly in terms of the original HTSE coefficients, which in turn results in an expression \chi_{\rm Pade}(T) for the susceptibility. The Pade approximant reformulation of the HTSE prediction for \chi decreases the minimum temperature at which the HTSE can be used to fit experimental data.

We fitted our \chi(T) data by

\[\chi(T)=\chi_{0}+\chi_{\rm Pade}(T,|J_{1}|,J_{2}/J_{1}).\] (33)

A fit of the experimental \chi_{ab}(T) data in Fig. 11 by Eq. (33) for J_{1}<0 and J_{2}/J_{1}=-1 was obtained, as dictated by the inelastic neutron scattering measurements,[25] and we also fixed g=2. The fit is shown in Fig. 14, where the fitting parameters \chi_{0} and J_{1} are given in the figure. The high-temperature series and Pade approximant derived from it are not expected to be valid to temperatures much below the temperature of the broad maximum, so we cut off the fit as shown. The value of \chi_{0} is perhaps too negative to be physical, which suggests that the model may not include all relevant exchange couplings.

#### iii.4.3 Extended 3D J_{1}-J_{2}-J_{c} spin S=1/2 Heisenberg model

The above fit of \chi(T) by the J_{1}-J_{2} model ignores the magnetic coupling between adjacent stacked Co square lattice layers along the c axis. To include this coupling, we utilize the above intralayer \chi_{\rm Pade}(T) in Eq. (33) as determined

Figure 14: (Color online) A fit of the ab-plane susceptibility \chi_{ab}(T) data for SrCo_{2}As_{2} from Fig. 11 (filled red circles) by the J_{1}-J_{2} spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on a square lattice according to Eq. (33) (blue curve). The fitting parameters are given in the figure where g=2 was assumed.

  from Eq. (32), but augment the J_{1}-J_{2} Heisenberg square lattice model by adding a nearest-neighbor c-axis Heisenberg coupling between the stacked square lattices using molecular field theory (MFT) as follows, where we utilize the fact that all Co spins are identical and crystallographically equivalent in SrCo_{2}As_{2}.

The time- and space-average magnetic moment component \mu_{i} in the direction of the applied field \mathbf{H} is

\[\mu_{i}=\frac{\chi_{\text{Padc}}}{N}(H+H_{\text{exch}\,c\,i}),\] (34a) where \[H_{\text{exch}\,c\,i}\] is the exchange field seen by \[\vec{\mu}_{i}\] due to the two moments in the two adjacent layers along the \[c\] axis. In MFT, one writes \[H_{\text{exch}\,c\,i}=\lambda_{c}\mu_{i},\] (34b) where \[\lambda_{c}\] is the MFT coupling constant of \[\vec{\mu}_{i}\] to the two moments in adjacent layers along the \[c\] axis. Substituting Eq. ( 34b ) into ( 34a ) and solving for \[\mu_{i}\] gives \[\mu_{i}=\frac{\chi_{\text{Padc}}H}{N}\frac{H}{1-\frac{2J_{\text{Padc}}}{N} \lambda_{c}},\] (34c) so the spin susceptibility per spin is \[\chi_{i}^{\text{spin}}=\frac{\mu_{i}}{H}=\frac{\chi_{\text{Padc}}/N}{1-\frac{ \chi_{\text{Padc}}}{N}\lambda_{c}},\] (34d) and for \[N\] spins one then obtains \[\chi^{\text{spin}}=\frac{\chi_{\text{Padc}}}{1-\frac{\chi_{\text{Padc}}}{N} \lambda_{c}}.\] (34e) Taking the reciprocal of each side of this equation gives \[\frac{1}{\chi^{\text{spin}}}=\frac{1}{\chi_{\text{Padc}}}-\frac{\lambda_{c}}{N}.\] (34f) Thus the MFT coupling parameter \[\lambda_{c}\] just shifts the entire inverse susceptibility versus \[T\] curve vertically by an amount \[-\lambda_{c}/N\] , and therefore does not change the temperature of the maximum in \[\chi(T)\] at about 115 K in Fig. 14 .

Now we express \[\lambda_{c}\] in terms of an exchange constant \[J_{c}\] between a spin and a nearest-neighbor spin in an adjacent layer. The part of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian associated with the interaction of spin \[\mathbf{S}_{i}\] with the two nearest-neighbor spins \[\mathbf{S}_{j}\] in adjacent layers is \[\mathcal{H}_{i}=\frac{1}{2}J_{c}\mathbf{S}_{i}\cdot\sum_{j=1}^{2}\mathbf{S}_{ j}=\frac{J_{c}}{2g^{2}\mu_{\text{B}}^{2}}\vec{\mu}_{i}\cdot\sum_{j=1}^{2}\vec{\mu}_{j},\] (35) where the factor of \[1/2\] arises because the exchange energy is equally shared by each spin within a pair of interacting spins. The magnetic moment \[\vec{\mu}\] and spin \[\mathbf{S}\] vectors are related by \[\vec{\mu}=-g\mathbf{S}\mu_{\text{B}}\] , where the minus sign arises from the negative sign of the charge on the electron. In MFT, one writes the time- and space-average of the energy per spin \[E_{i}\] in the PM state as \[E_{i}=\frac{J_{c}}{g^{2}\mu_{\text{B}}^{2}}\mu_{i}\mu_{j}\equiv-\frac{1}{2} \mu_{i}H_{\text{exch}\,c\,i},\] (36) where the factor of \[1/2\] on the right-hand side arises because when calculating the exchange field, all of the interaction energy \[E_{i}\] between moments \[\vec{\mu}_{i}\] and \[\vec{\mu}_{j}\] is assigned to the neighbor \[\vec{\mu}_{j}\] of \[\vec{\mu}_{i}\] . Then, recognizing that the average moments satisfy \[\mu_{i}=\mu_{j}\] in the PM state, the exchange field associated with the \[c\] -axis interactions is found from Eq. ( 36 ) to be \[H_{\text{exch}\,c\,i}=-\frac{2J_{c}}{g^{2}\mu_{\text{B}}^{2}}\mu_{i}.\] (37) Comparing Eqs. ( 37 ) and ( 34b ) gives \[\lambda_{c}=\frac{2J_{c}}{g^{2}\mu_{\text{B}}^{2}}.\] (38) Substituting Eq. ( 38 ) into ( 34e ) gives \[\chi^{\text{spin}}(T)=\frac{\chi_{\text{Padc}}(T)}{1+\frac{2J_{\text{Padc}}(T )}{Ng^{2}\mu_{\text{B}}^{2}}}.\] (39) From Eq. ( 39 ), an AFM (positive) J_{c} suppresses the susceptibility, whereas a FM (negative) J_{c} enhances it, as expected. Our inelastic neutron scattering results indicated an AFM Co-Co interlayer interaction in SrCo_{2}As_{2}.[23] Therefore the anomalously negative value of \chi_{0} derived in the previous section that suppresses \chi probably arises at least in part from the presence of the c-axis AFM Co-Co interactions that are neglected in the J_{1}-J_{2} model. Using Eq. (39 ), in order to produce the same effect on \chi(T) at its maximum as \chi_{0}=-5.8\times 10^{-4} cm^{3}/mol (Fig. 14 ) would require J_{c}/k_{\text{B}}=460 K, which according to our inelastic neutron scattering data (Ref. [23]) is much too large compared to |J_{1}|, J_{2}=138 K and should therefore be considered an upper limit. We conclude that within the present model, a significant diamagnetic \chi_{0} value as well as a significant AFM c-axis coupling are present.

Finally, we add a caveat that our analyses of the magnetic properties of AFM CaCo_{2}As_{2} indicate that the magnetism is itinerant,[27] whereas the above analyses of \chi(T) for SrCo_{2}As_{2} were carried out within a local-moment picture.

## IX NMR spectroscopy

Figure 15 shows field-swept ^{75}As-NMR spectra of SrCo_{2}As_{2} at T=4.2 K for two magnetic field directions of H\parallel c axis and H\parallel ab plane. The spectra exhibit features

Figure 15: (Color online) Field-swept ^{75}As-NMR spectra of SrCo_{2}As_{2} at temperature T=4.2 K for magnetic fields H perpendicular and parallel to the c axis. The vertical dashed blue line corresponds to the zero-shift (K=0) position. Inset: ^{75}As nuclear quadruple frequency v_{0} versus T.

  typical of a nuclear spin I=3/2 with Zeeman and quadrupolar interactions, which result in a sharp central transition and two satellite peaks split by the quadrupolar interaction of the ^{75}As nucleus with the local electric field gradient (EFG). The principle axis of the EFG at the As site in tetragonal SrCo_{2}As_{2} is found to be along the crystal c axis as for members of the AFe_{2}As_{2} family that have tetragonal symmetry,[76, 77, 78, 79, 80] since in our CoAs-based compound and in the tetragonal FeAs-based materials the As site has a local fourfold rotational symmetry about the c axis. The spectra for SrCo_{2}As_{2} for both H directions did not show any obvious magnetic broadenings at any temperature between 1.6 and 275 K, which indicates that static magnetic ordering does not occur in this compound above 1.6 K.

The inset of Fig. 15 shows the temperature dependence of the nuclear quadrupole frequency v_{\rm Q}=e\,QV_{ZZ}/2h, where Q is the electric quadrupole moment of the ^{75}As nucleus, V_{ZZ} is the principal-axis EFG at the As site and h is Planck's constant. V_{ZZ} arises from hybridization between the As-4 p and Co-3d orbitals with an additional contribution from the noncubic part of the spatial distribution of surrounding ions. The v_{\rm Q} decreases by about 15% on cooling, from 10 MHz at 250 K to 8.45 MHz at 1.6 K. A decrease of v_{\rm Q} by \sim 15% on lowering T from 280 to 140 K was also observed in BaFe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [76]) where v_{\rm Q} is much smaller in BaFe_{2}As_{2} than in SrCo_{2}As_{2}. These behaviors sharply contrast with that observed for SrFe_{2}As_{2} where v_{\rm Q}_increases_ from 2.0 MHz at 300 K to 2.6 MHz at \sim 210 K.[76]

Figure 16(a) shows the T dependences of the NMR shifts K_{ab} and K_{c} for H parallel to the ab plane and parallel to the c axis, respectively, where the second-order quadrupole shift was corrected for in K_{ab}(T). As T decreases below room temperature, both K_{ab} and K_{c} increase and show broad maxima at the about the same temperature of \approx 115 K, similar to the \chi(T) behavior in Fig. 11, and then decrease monotonically at lower T without showing upturns. The small upturns in \chi(T) observed at low T in Fig. 11 are therefore not intrinsic and evidently arise from a small amount of a PM impurity that is not saturable in fields up to 5.5 T (see Fig. 10).

Figure 16(b) shows K_{ab} and K_{c} from Fig. 16(a) versus \chi_{ab} and \chi_{c} from Fig. 11, respectively, with T as an implicit parameter, for T\

 below 38 K in the inset of Fig. 4 above is another indication of Fermi liquid behavior.

Next, we discuss the relationship between the anisotropy of our 1/T_{1} data and the anisotropy of the Co spin fluctuations. Here we follow the same procedure previously performed on Fe pnictides. [76, 81, 82] In general, 1/T_{1} can be described in terms of the fluctuating hyperfine field perpendicular to the applied magnetic field at the NMR angular frequency \omega_{\rm N} according to

\[\left(\frac{1}{T_{1}}\right)_{z} = \frac{\gamma_{\rm N}^{2}}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}[(H_{{\rm hf}, x}(t),H_{{\rm hf},x}(0))\] (40) \[+(H_{{\rm hf},y}(t),H_{{\rm hf},y}(0))]\exp(i\omega_{\rm N}t)\,dt\] \[= \gamma_{\rm N}^{2}\sum_{\bf q}[|H_{{\rm hf},x}({\bf q},\omega_{\rm N })|^{2}+|H_{{\rm hf},y}({\bf q},\omega_{\rm N})|^{2}],\]

where the z direction corresponds to the external field direction and |X({\bf q},\omega_{\rm N})|^{2} denotes the {\bf q}-dependent power spectral density at \omega_{\rm N} of a time-dependent random variable X(t).

Defining the hyperfine coupling tensor as \tilde{A}, the hyperfine fields at the As site can be described as the sum of contributions from the four nearest-neighbor Co spins as [77, 82]

\[{\bf H}_{\rm hf}({\bf q},\omega_{\rm N})=\sum_{i=1}^{4}\tilde{A}_{i}\mathcal{S }_{i}({\bf q},\omega_{\rm N})=\tilde{A}\mathcal{S}_{i}({\bf q},\omega_{\rm N}),\] (41)

where

\[\tilde{A}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}A_{a}&D&B_{1}\\ D&A_{b}&B_{2}\\ B_{1}&B_{2}&A_{c}\end{array}\right).\] (42)

Here, \tilde{A} is described in orthorhombic axis (stacked Co square-lattice) notation for consistency with the previous discussion on Fe pnictides. [77] We consider the cases where A_{a} (\alpha=a,\,b,\,c), B_{i} (i=1,2) and D in \tilde{A} are, respectively, the diagonal components along the \alpha direction with {\bf q}=(0,0), the off-diagonal components related to stripe AFM correlations with {\bf q}=(\pi,0) or (0,\pi), and the off-diagonal components associated with Neel-type spin correlations with {\bf q}=(\pi,\pi). [81] Defining the amplitude of the spin fluctuation spectral density as \mathcal{S}_{a}\equiv\sqrt{|S_{a}({\bf q},\omega_{\rm N})|^{2}} (\alpha=a,\,b,\,c), using the above equations and writing A_{ab}\equiv A_{a}=A_{b} and \mathcal{S}_{ab}\equiv\mathcal{S}_{a}=\mathcal{S}_{b} appropriate to the tetragonal symmetry of SrCo_{2}As_{2}, the ratio

\[r\equiv\frac{T_{1,c}}{T_{1,ab}}\] (43)

is obtained as [82]

\[r=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}0.5+0.5\left(\frac{A_{c}\mathcal{S}_{a}}{\mathcal{ S}_{a}}\right)^{2}&{\rm for}\ {\bf q}=(0,0),\\ 0.5+\left(\frac{\mathcal{S}_{a}}{\mathcal{S}_{r}}\right)^{2}&{\rm for}\ { \bf q}=(\pi,0)\ {\rm or}\ (0,\pi),\\ 0.5&{\rm for}\ {\bf q}=(\pi,\pi).\end{array}\right.\] (44b)

As plotted in Fig. 17(c), r is almost constant versus T with a value r\approx 1. From our inelastic neutron scattering measurements, the dominant AFM fluctuations/correlations are stripe-type with {\bf q}=(\pi,0) or (0,\pi) in Co square-lattice notation. [23] According to Eq. (44b), the value r\approx 1 observed in Fig. 17(c) then arises from anisotropic spin fluctuations with \mathcal{S}_{ab}\approx 0.71\,\mathcal{S}_{c}. This means that stripe-type AFM Co spin fluctuations along the c-axis are stronger than in the ab plane. An anisotropy in spin fluctuations is also observed in various Fe-based superconductors in the paramagnetic state near T_{\rm N}, but \mathcal{S}_{ab} is always larger than \mathcal{S}_{c}, [76, 63] in contrast to our result for SrCo_{2}As_{2}. Neel-type AFM spin fluctuations with {\bf q}=(\pi,\pi) can be ruled out because according to Eq. (44c), that would require r=0.5 in conflict with our measurements in Fig. 17(c) that give r\approx 1.

Our 1/T_{1} data can also be analyzed with Eq. (44a) solely in terms of FM spin fluctuations with {\bf q}=(0,0). Using the ratio of the hyperfine fields A_{c}/A_{ab}=45.0/65.9=0.653 determined from the K-\chi plot in Fig. 16(b), r\approx 1 can be reproduced with anisotropic spin fluctuations with \mathcal{S}_{ab}=0.65\,\mathcal{S}_{c}. Interestingly, this analysis also gives the same nature of the anisotropy of the spin fluctuations as discussed above for stripe-type AFM fluctuations. Therefore one cannot uniquely determine the nature of the spin fluctuations utilizing NMR data alone. The {\bf q}-dependent static susceptibility \chi({\bf q}) obtained from electronic structure calculations showed a peak at {\bf q}=(0,0) as well as at {\bf q}=(\pi,0) and (0,\pi), [23] so spin fluctuations may well occur with peaks at both the FM and stripe-type AFM wave vectors.

From our NMR data on SrCo_{2}As_{2} crystals we conclude that the conduction carriers form a Fermi liquid that exhibits significant FM and/or AFM spin fluctuations. The presence of strong AFM spin fluctuations at low temperatures has been specifically demonstrated from our inelastic neutron scattering measurements of single crystals, [23] and FM correlations from the strongly enhanced \chi discussed above in Sec. VIII.1.

## X Single-crystal neutron diffraction

The above thermal expansion, \rho(T), C_{\rm p}(T), \chi(T), and NMR measurements showed no evidence for any phase transitions from 1.3 to 300 K in SrCo_{2}As_{2}. This result is consistent with the neutron scattering measurements on SrCo_{2}As_{2} crystals [23] that showed no evidence for long-range AFM order at the propagation vector of the stripe-type AFM order found [3] in the 122-type iron arsenides. However, the

Figure 17: (Color online) (a) Temperature dependence of 1/T_{1} for SrCo_{2}As_{2} for both magnetic field directions, H\parallel c axis and H\parallel ab plane. The straight line shows the metallic Korringa dependence 1/T_{1}\propto T. (b) T dependence of T_{1}T\kappa^{2}. The symbol designations are the same as in (a). (c) T dependence of the ratio r=T_{1,c}/T_{1,ab}.

  inelastic neutron scattering measurements did show strong dynamic AFM correlations in SrCo_{2}As_{2} at this propagation vector.[23] On the other hand, neutron diffraction measurements on CaCo_{2}As_{2} confirmed the presence of A-type long-range AFM order characterized by magnetic Bragg peaks at reciprocal lattice points (h 0 \ell) with h+\ell=2n+1 [e.g., (2 0 1) and (2 0 3)] with an upper limit of 0.6 \mu_{\text{B}}/Co for the ordered moment.[27]

To complement the above null result for the occurrence of long-range stripe-type AFM ordering in SrCo_{2}As_{2}, here we searched for evidence of A-type[27] or G-type[41] long-range AFM order in a SrCo_{2}As_{2} crystal using single-crystal neutron diffraction at the base temperature of T\approx 3 K and did not find any such evidence. Figure 18 shows scans through both nuclear [Figs. 18(a) and 18(b)] and A-type AFM [Figs. 18(c) and 18(d)] Bragg peak positions. There is no evidence of scattering above background at the latter positions. Note the factor of \sim15,000 finer scale of the ordinates for the potential AFM peak positions in Figs. 18(c) and 18(d) compared to those of the nuclear reflections in Figs. 18(a) and 18(b). The small increase in scattering with decreasing angle in Fig. 18(c) is likely due to some degree of preferred orientation in the Al sample can since the scattering angle is close to that for the Al (2 0 0) powder line. Measurements to check for G-type long-range AFM order are complicated by the fact that the AFM Bragg reflections are coincident with nuclear Bragg peaks. However, we found no evidence of enhanced scattering at the (1 0 1) position of the strongest G-type AFM reflection (not shown).

## XI Ground state of SrCo_{2}As_{2}

Our x-ray and neutron diffraction, \rho(T), M(H,T), \chi(T), C_{\text{p}}(T), and NMR measurements reveal no evidence for any phase transitions in SrCo_{2}As_{2} from 300 K down to 1.3 K. On the other hand, the temperature T_{\text{max}}\approx 115 K at which the broad maximum in \chi(T) occurs, the Weiss temperature \theta_{\text{p}}\sim-150 K in the Curie-Weiss law fits from 200 to 300 K in Table 3, the large values of |J_{1}|=J_{2}=138 K in Fig. 14 obtained by fitting the \chi(T) data by the J_{1}-J_{2} model, and the observation of strong stripe-type AFM spin correlations in neutron scattering measurements[23] demonstrate that AFM spin correlations are present and are strong. However, long-range AFM order is not observed above 1.3 K. A measure of the ratio of the energy scale of the AFM spin correlations to the long-range AFM transition temperature T_{\text{N}}<1.3 K is therefore

\[f=\frac{|\theta_{\text{p}}|}{T_{\text{N}}}\gtrsim 100.\] (45)

In insulating local-moment systems, f is called the frustration parameter.[84] In such systems in which frustration prevents long-range AFM ordering, a ratio f\gtrsim 100 and the absence of static magnetic ordering of any kind occurring in the accessible temperature range point towards a quantum spin-liquid (QSL) ground state in which quantum fluctuations prevent static long-range magnetic ordering from occurring. Thus to establish a probable quantum spin-liquid ground state,[85] one needs to demonstrate (1) the presence of spin interactions and have a measure of its strength such as \theta_{\text{p}}, which establishes the presence of a spin liquid instead of a spin gas, (2) that static magnetic ordering does not occur in the accessible temperature range, (3) that a relation such as Eq. (45) is satisfied, and (4) that the lattice symmetry is not broken by the putative QSL ground state. An extensively studied example of an insulator containing Cu^{+2} spins-1/2 that satisfies these conditions is ZnCu_{3}(OH)_{6}Cl_{2} (or with deuterium replacing H), which is called herbertsmithite.[86, 87, 88, 89, 90]

The concept of a QSL ground state has been applied in the past to insulating spin S=1/2 local-moment systems.[85] However, some itinerant spin systems such as the iron pnictides and chalcogenides and related materials are moderately correlated electron systems and sometimes have both itinerant and local-moment characteristics.[3, 91, 92, 93, 94] In such cases, we suggest that one may be able to apply the same four criteria above with respect to a possible QSL ground state. In particular, since we have demonstrated that the above four conditions are satisfied for metallic SrCo_{2}As_{2}, we suggest that this compound has a quantum spin-liquid ground state. An alternative and very rare ground state for metallic strongly-correlated frustrated d-electron systems is a heavy-fermion ground state as observed in the cubic spinel-structure metallic compound LiV_{2}O_{4}.[95, 96, 97] This compound shows local-moment Curie-Weiss behavior at high T and crosses over to the heavy-fermion ground state below about 10 K.

## XII Summary and conclusions

A comprehensive study of the crystallographic, electronic, magnetic, and thermal properties of SrCo_{2}As_{2} single crystals

Figure 18: (Color online) Single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements at T=3 K searching for A-type AFM order in SrCo_{2}As_{2}. The (0 0 8) and (2 0 0) nuclear Bragg peaks are shown in panels (a) and (b), respectively. The neutron intensity measured as the sample is rocked through the (2 0 1) and (2 0 3) positions at which magnetic Bragg peaks would be observed for A-type AFM ordering is shown in panels (c) and (d), respectively. The calculated values of \theta_{\text{sample}} of this potential type of AFM ordering are 40.4^{\circ} in (c) and 62.2^{\circ} in (d), respectively, which are near the middle of the respective scans.

  is reported. The room-temperature crystal structure was confirmed to be the body-centered tetragonal ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type (I4/mmm) structure with an As-As interlayer distance intermediate between the uncollapsed- and collapsed-tetragonal values in BaCo_{2}As_{2} and CaCo_{2}As_{2}, respectively. No phase transitions of any kind were detected between 1.3 and 300 K in any of our measurements, in spite of the strong negative thermal expansion of the c axis from 7.4 to 300 K and the negative volume expansion from 7.4 to \approx 80 K. The a-axis thermal expansion is normal (positive) from 7.4 to 300 K. Furthermore, we determined from neutron diffraction measurements on a single crystal that long-range AFM order is not present at 3 K for either A-type or G-type ordering, which complements our previous determination that such ordering also does not occur at the propagation vector for stripe-type AFM ordering.[23]

The \rho(T) and ARPES measurements and the LDA band structure calculations consistently demonstrate that SrCo_{2}As_{2} is metallic with electron Fermi surfaces centered at \Gamma (0,0) and on the edges of the first Brillouin zone (BZ) at \mathbf{k}=(\pm\pi,0) and \mathbf{k}=(0,\,\pm\pi). An anomalous flat band with d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} character is also present in the second BZ that extends over a large fraction of the zone and results in a sharp and high peak in the electronic density of states \mathcal{D}(E\approx E_{\mathrm{F}}). This feature may be responsible for some of the anomalous properties we observe such as the negative thermal expansion and perhaps some of the T-dependent magnetic properties. The C_{\mathrm{p}}(T) and \frac{1}{T_{1}}(T) NMR data also exhibit metallic Fermi liquid character via the presence of a Sommerfeld electronic contribution \gamma\,T and a Korringa contribution, respectively. A comparison of the measured and band structure values of \gamma indicates a value of the combined many-body electron-phonon and electron-electron density of states enhancements of \approx 45%.

The \chi(T) data show a Curie-Weiss-like T dependence above 200 K with a large negative (AFM) Weiss temperature \theta_{\mathrm{p}}\sim-150 K indicative of dominant AFM correlations in the system, consistent with our inelastic neutron scattering measurements that demonstrated the presence of strong stripe-type AFM fluctuations[23] that occur at the same wave vector as in the AFe_{2}As_{2} high-T_{\mathrm{c}} parent compounds.[3, 10] However, our ARPES measurements and band structure calculations for SrCo_{2}As_{2} show no obvious Fermi surface nesting occurring at this wave vector, in contrast to the clear nesting at this wave vector in the semimetallic AFe_{2}As_{2} compounds.[3] The anisotropy of I/T_{1} determined from our NMR measurements is consistent with either stripe-type AFM spin correlations or FM spin correlations or a combination of these. At low temperatures, the \chi(T) data for the two field directions show an upturn, but our NMR Knight shift measurements of the spin susceptibility show that these upturns are not intrinsic.

We modeled our \chi(T) data at high T by a Curie-Weiss law and obtained values for the Curie constant and for the Weiss temperature \theta_{\mathrm{p}}\sim-150 K, which is strongly antiferromagnetic. We also modeled the data, including the broad maximum at \approx 115 K, using a local-moment interconfigurational fluctuation model between a ground state level with spin S=0 and an excited triplet state with S=1, and obtained good fits to the powder-averaged \chi(T) data. We further modeled the data in terms of the J_{1}-J_{2} frustrated local-moment spin-1/2 square lattice Heisenberg model. For the latter model, a good fit to the \chi_{ab}(T) data was obtained for a FM (negative) J_{1}, AFM J_{2} and J_{2}/J_{1}=-1, as suggested by the inelastic neutron scattering results,[23] with |J_{1}|/K_{\mathrm{B}}=J_{2}/K_{\mathrm{B}}=138 K.

The \chi for SrCo_{2}As_{2} has a large magnitude, roughly a factor of 3-5 larger than those of the AFe_{2}As_{2} compounds in the paramagnetic state.[3] Within an itinerant magnetism picture, this suggests an even larger Stoner enhancement than in the FeAs-based compounds.[3] Moreover, the Wilson ratio for SrCo_{2}As_{2} is \approx 3.5 and the Stoner criterion indicates that this compound should be an itinerant ferromagnet. A similar situation occurs in BaCo_{2}As_{2}, where it was suggested that strong quantum fluctuations occur due to proximity to a quantum critical point that suppress long-range FM order.[24]

Thus, in SrCo_{2}As_{2}, both FM and stripe-type AFM fluctuations/correlations appear to coexist, as also indicated by static \chi(\mathbf{q}) calculations that show peaks at both wave vectors.[23] This competition, the formal intermediate valence of the Co ions and the resultant quantum fluctuations may suppress the occurrence of any type of static long-range magnetic order in this compound. As discussed in Sec. XI, we suggest that metallic SrCo_{2}As_{2} has a gapless quantum spin-liquid (QSL) ground state. It will be very interesting to study in detail the spin excitation spectrum of this compound and compare it with those of insulating local-moment systems that are the traditional candidates for QSL ground states.

The FeAs-based and cuprate high-T_{\mathrm{c}} superconductors have a common phenomenology in which long-range AFM order of the parent compounds must be largely suppressed before superconductivity appears, but where strong AFM fluctuations must still be present to act as the superconducting glue. Even though we have demonstrated that these two conditions are met in undoped SrCo_{2}As_{2}, this compound is not superconducting above 1.8 K. Key open questions are therefore why superconductivity does not occur in SrCo_{2}As_{2}, what the role of the FM correlations is, and whether chemical substitutions of some type or applied pressure can induce superconductivity, perhaps even at high temperatures.

* [63] The values of \chi(1.8 K) quoted for a BaCo_{2}As_{2} crystal in the text of Ref. [24] and plotted in Fig. 1 of Ref.

(13). These errors in the quoted values of \chi_{c} and \chi_{ab} in Ref. [24] are due to the presence of a small amount of ferromagnetic impurity in the crystal that was not accounted for, combined with the small field H=0.1 T that was used to obtain the \chi\equiv M/H data in their Fig. 1. Furthermore, the anisotropy obtained from their high-field measurements may be reversed compared that shown in their Fig. 1 obtained at H=0.1 T and in the inset to their Fig. 1 (A. S. Sefat, private communication). In very recent measurements on single crystals [V. K. Anand, _et al._ (unpublished)], our group finds that the \chi anisotropy of BaCo_{2}As_{2} is reversed from that in Fig. 1 of Ref. [24] and from that in our Eqs. (13) derived from their data. For a discussion of the effects of ferromagnetic impurities on the measured M and \chi\equiv M/H values of materials see Sec. 3.5.2 of Ref. [3]. We thank A. S.

###### Abstract

In tetragonal SrCo_{2}As_{2} single crystals, inelastic neutron scattering measurements demonstrated that strong stripe-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations occur at a temperature T = 5 K [Jayasekara _et al._, arXiv:1306.5174] that are the same as in the isostructural AFe_{2}As_{2} (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) parent compounds of high-T_{\rm c} superconductors. This surprising discovery suggests that SrCo_{2}As_{2} may also be a good parent compound for high-T_{\rm c} superconductivity. Here structural and thermal expansion, electrical resistivity \rho, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), heat capacity C_{\rm p}, magnetic susceptibility \chi, ^{75}As NMR, and neutron diffraction measurements of SrCo_{2}As_{2} crystals are reported together with LDA band structure calculations that shed further light on this fascinating material. The c-axis thermal expansion coefficient \alpha_{c} is _negative_ from 7 to 300 K, whereas \alpha_{c} (the a-axis thermal expansion coefficient) is positive over this T range. The \rho(T) shows metallic character. The ARPES measurements and band theory confirm the metallic character and in addition show the presence of a flat band near the Fermi energy E_{F}. The band calculations exhibit an extremely sharp peak in the density of states \mathcal{D}(E\approx E_{F}) arising from a flat d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} band, where the x and y axes are along the a and b axes of the Co square lattice, respectively. A comparison of the Sommerfeld coefficient of the electronic specific heat with \chi(T\to 0) suggests the presence of strong ferromagnetic itinerant spin correlations, which on the basis of the Stoner criterion predicts that SrCo_{2}As_{2} should be an itinerant ferromagnet, in conflict with the magnetization data. The \chi(T) does have a large magnitude, but also exhibits a broad maximum at \approx 115 K suggestive of dynamic short-range AFM spin correlations, in agreement with the neutron scattering data. The measurements show no evidence for any type of phase transition between 1.3 and 300 K and we suggest that metallic SrCo_{2}As_{2} has a gapless quantum spin-liquid ground state.

## 1 Introduction

After the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) below T_{\rm c} = 26 K in tetragonal LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} (1111-type) in 2008,^{1} a worldwide effort began to understand the mechanism for the SC and to discover other Fe-based superconductors. This effort quickly led to the enhancement of T_{\rm c} to its current record among bulk Fe-based superconductors of T_{\rm c} = 56.3 K for the 1111-type compound Gd_{0.8}Th_{0.2}FeAsO.^{2} Additional families of Fe-based high-T_{\rm c} superconductors were soon discovered including the 122-type arsenides where the parent compounds have composition AFe_{2}As_{2} (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu) with the tetragonal ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure (space group 14/mmm).^{3,\ast}^{-}^{5} All families of Fe-based high-T_{\rm c} superconductors contain stacked square lattices of Fe atoms that are identical to the stacked square lattices of Cu atoms in the layered high-T_{\rm c} cuprates.^{3,\ast,\ast,\ast}^{-}^{8}

The 122-type family of iron arsenide-based superconductors is the most studied because large, high-quality single crystals can be grown,^{9} and the parent compounds offer enormous flexibility for chemical substitutions on the A, Fe, and As sites. Crystals with masses \sim1 g can be grown, which allows a broad range of measurements including inelastic neutron scattering measurements to be performed to characterize and understand the properties. It has been demonstrated that the parent compounds at ambient pressure exhibit a lattice distortion to an orthorhombic structure at a system-dependent T_{\rm S}\lesssim 200 K together with long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at the same or somewhat lower Neel temperature T_{\rm N}.^{3,10} The ordering propagation vector is the same as the nesting wave vector between the hole and electron pockets of the semimetallic band structure. This and the low ordered moments^{3,10}\mu\lesssim 1\mu_{\rm B}/Fe indicate an itinerant origin of the AFM^{11,12} rather than arising from interactions between local Fe magnetic moments.

The AFM structure within the ab plane of the Fe square lattice is a so-called "stripe" structure in which ferromagnetically aligned stripes of Fe magnetic moments along the orthorhombic b axis are AFM aligned along the a axis.^{5,10} These orthorhombic axes have the same directions as the respective Fe square lattice a and b axes, which are in turn rotated by 45^{\circ} with respect to the a and b axes of the body-centered tetragonal ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type crystal structure. Furthermore, in order for high-T_{\rm c} SC to occur, this long-range AFM ordering must be largely suppressed by chemical substitutions or pressure, but strong dynamic short-range AFM correlations must still be preserved. These AFM fluctuations/correlations are widely considered to be the glue for the SC Cooper pairs.^{3,11,13,14} A similar phenomenology and temperature-doping phase diagram are found for the high-T_{\rm c} cuprates.^{6,\ast,\ast,\ast,\ast}^{-}^{15}

Among the substituted 122-type materials,^{3} the best studied are Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} with T_{\rm c}\leqslant 38 K,^{16} Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As  with T_{\rm c}\leqslant 25 K [17, 18, 19], and BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} with T_{\rm c}\leqslant 30 K [20]. The detailed temperature-composition phase diagram for Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} with 0\leqslant x\leqslant 0.12 shows, as T\to 0, an AFM region at 0\leqslant x\lesssim 0.03, a region of coexisting AFM and SC for 0.03\lesssim x\lesssim 0.06 and a region of only SC order (the remaining part of the superconducting dome) for 0.06\lesssim x\lesssim 0.12, where T_{\rm c}\to 0 at x\approx 0.12[19]. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements demonstrated that the AFM correlations/fluctuations that are present in the paramagnetic (PM) state of BaFe_{2}As_{2} above T_{\rm N}=136 K (Ref. [21]) are absent in the nonsuperconducting PM composition x=0.14 at 10 K [22], consistent with the hypothesis that AFM spin fluctuations are required as the SC pairing glue in these materials [3, 10].

As might be expected from the latter result, neither magnetic susceptibility [18]\chi(T) nor neutron diffraction [23] measurements on SrCo_{2}As_{2} showed any evidence for long-range magnetic ordering above 1.8 and 4 K, respectively. This is the same result as found for isostructural BaCo_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [24]) but is in contrast to the magnetic behavior of CaCo_{2}As_{2}, which shows A-type AFM ordering below a sample-dependent T_{\rm N} of 53 to 76 K [25, 26, 27]. The ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type crystal structure of SrCo_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [28]) is shown in Fig. 1(a).

The As-As interlayer distance d_{\rm As-As} [see Fig. 1(a)] is correlated with the magnetic ground state [29], where a "layer" is defined as an As-M-As layer and M is the transition metal, as shown in Fig. 1(b). CaCo_{2}As_{2} with an AFM ground state has a collapsed tetragonal (cT) structure reflecting approach to interlayer As-As dimerization, where the As-As single-covalent-bond distance [30] is indicated in Fig. 1(b), whereas BaCo_{2}As_{2} with a PM ground state has an uncollapsed tetragonal (T) structure without such dimerization. SrCo_{2}As_{2} also has a PM ground state and is in an intermediate regime [29], as seen in Fig. 1(b). This correlation between the magnetic behavior and the crystal structure contrasts with that of the 122-type AF_{2}As_{2} compounds where the cT structure of CaFe_{2}As_{2} has a nonmagnetic ground state and the T structures of the Ca, Sr, and Ba compounds all have AFM ground states [3, 29, 31, 32, 33]. Interlayer As-As dimerization in the cT phase results in a valence of As^{-2}, i.e., [As-As^{-4}, instead of the usual As^{-3} valence in the 122-type (Ca, Sr, Ba)M_{2}As_{2} compounds, corresponding to a formal M oxidation state of M^{+1} instead of the usual M^{+2}. From Fig. 1(b), SrCo_{2}As_{2} may be in a regime with intermediate Co oxidation state between Co^{+1} in CaCo_{2}As_{2} and Co^{+2} in BaCo_{2}As_{2}. This intermediate valence state, in turn, might be expected to result in strong dynamic Co spin fluctuations in SrCo_{2}As_{2}.

In view of the disappearance of dynamic AFM correlations in the PM state of the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} system as x increases from x=0 to 0.14 [21, 22], it is amazing that strong AFM stripe-type correlations are present in the x=1 end-member SrCo_{2}As_{2} of the similar series Sr(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} (Refs. [34, 35, 36]) as established from inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single crystals [23]. The above-noted intermediate valence of the Co in SrCo_{2}As_{2} may be responsible for the lack of long-range AFM order, at least in part. The presence of these AFM correlations in SrCo_{2}As_{2} raises key questions about how they come about in this compound, why this compound is not superconducting, and whether it could be made superconducting by some type of chemical substitution or by application of pressure.

Here we report the investigation of undoped SrCo_{2}As_{2} single crystals using x-ray and neutron diffractions, in-plane (ab-plane) electrical resistivity \rho, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), heat capacity C_{\rm p}, magnetization M, \chi, and ^{75}As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, complemented by LDA band structure calculations. Experimental and theoretical details are given in Sec. II. The x-ray diffraction investigations of crushed crystals in Sec. III yield a structure in agreement with previous work. The \rho(T) measurements in Sec. IV demonstrate metallic character, consistent with the ARPES measurements in Sec. V, which also indicate that there is no obvious significant Fermi surface

  nesting. The band theory calculations in Sec. VI reveal a sharp and high peak in the density of states near the Fermi energy \mathcal{D}(E\approx E_{\rm F}). The C_{\rm p} measurements in Sec. VII further confirm the metallic character and confirm the presence of a large \mathcal{D}(E\approx E_{\rm F}). The M and \chi measurements in Sec. VIII show clear evidence for dynamic short-range AFM spin correlations in a quasi-low-dimensional spin lattice, consistent with the inelastic neutron scattering results.[23] The NMR measurements are presented in Sec. IX, which indicate the presence of stripe-type and/or FM correlations. The x-ray diffraction, \rho, C_{\rm p}, \chi, and NMR measurements reveal no obvious phase transitions between 1.3 and 300 K, in agreement with the previous[23] and present neutron diffraction measurements in Sec. X. In Sec. XI, we discuss the ground state of metallic SrCo_{2}As_{2} and suggest that this compound has a gapless quantum spin-liquid ground state. A summary and our conclusions are given in Sec. XII.

## II Experimental and theoretical details

Single crystals of SrCo_{2}As_{2} were grown from solution using Sn flux. In the Fe-based high-T_{\rm c} superconductivity field, Sn flux was first used by Ni _et al._ to grow crystals of BaFe_{2}As_{2} and Ba_{0.55}K_{0.45}Fe_{2}As_{2}.[37] High-purity elements Sr (99.95%) from Sigma-Aldrich, and Co (99.998%), As (99.9999%), and Sn (99.999%) from Alfa Aesar, were taken in 1:2:2:45 ratio and placed in an alumina crucible that was sealed in an evacuated silica tube. After prereacting the elements at 610 degC for 5 h, the assembly was heated to 1150 degC, left here for 8 h and then slowly cooled to 700 degC in 160 h. At this temperature, the flux was decanted using a centrifuge. The typical size of the crystals obtained was 2\times 2\times 0.3 mm^{3}. However, by increasing the size of the crucible to a 10 mL capacity, large crystals of SrCo_{2}As_{2} with masses up to \approx 1 g with dimensions up to 15\times 10\times 1 mm^{3} can be grown out of Sn flux.[23]

The chemical compositions of the crystals were determined by energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX) using a JEOL-JSM-5910LV scanning electron microscope and found to be in agreement with the expected stoichiometric composition SrCo_{2}As_{2}. These EDX measurements showed no visible peaks at the expected positions of the Sn x-ray emission lines, and the amount of Sn incorporated into the crystals from the Sn flux was given by the software as 0.22(16) at%, which is consistent with zero to within 1.3\sigma. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that a very small amount of Sn was incorporated into the crystals, which might have had some influence on the results of our physical property measurements. For comparison, BaFe_{2}As_{2} crystals grown in Sn flux contain \sim1 at% Sn as determined using wavelength-dispersive x-ray analysis,[37] which results in large changes in the physical properties such as in a reduction of the tetragonal to orthorhombic structural transition temperature from 136 K in pure crystals grown out of FeAs self-flux as discovered by Wang _et al.[38]_ to the value of 85 K in the crystals grown out of Sn flux by Ni _et al.[37]_

Structural characterization was performed using room-temperature powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) data obtained on crushed crystals using a Rigaku Geigerflex powder diffractometer and Cu-K_{\alpha} radiation. Rietveld refinement of the XRD data was carried out using the fullprof package.[39] The M(H), \chi, C_{\rm p}, and four-probe \rho measurements were performed using instruments from Quantum Design, Inc. In the M(H), \chi, and C_{\rm p} measurements, the contribution of the sample holder was measured separately and corrected for in each case.

A high-resolution x-ray powder diffraction pattern was collected at ambient temperature at the beamline X16C at the National Synchrotron Light Source. The sample was ground with an agate mortar and pestle in a glovebox having a water vapor concentration of a few parts per million, loaded into a glass Lindemann capillary of 0.3-mm nominal diameter, and flame-sealed without exposure to the atmosphere. The x-ray wavelength, 0.6995 A, was chosen using a Si(111) double monochromator. The powder diffraction pattern was collected in the 5-45^{\circ}2\theta range with a constant step size of 0.005^{\circ}, and a linearly varying counting time of 1-3 s/point. The incident beam intensity was monitored with an ion chamber and the diffracted radiation was measured with a NaI(Tl) scintillation detector. The axial and in-plane resolution of the diffractometer were set by slits and a Ge(111) analyzer crystal, respectively. Rietveld refinement of the x-ray diffraction pattern was done using the gsas[40] package.

High-resolution single-crystal x-ray diffraction measurements were performed on a four-circle diffractometer using Cu-K_{\alpha 1} radiation from a rotating anode x-ray source, selected by a Ge(111) monochromator. For measurements of the temperature dependence of the lattice parameters, a platelike single crystal, with the tetragonal c axis perpendicular to the plate, was attached to a flat copper sample holder on the cold finger of a He closed-cycle displex refrigerator. The sample was oriented such that the (h0\ell) plane or the (hh\ell) plane of the reciprocal lattice was coincident with the scattering plane of the diffractometer.

Single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements were done on the TRIAX triple-axis spectrometer at the University of Missouri Research Reactor employing an incident neutron energy of 14.7 meV. A platelike crystal of mass 302.4 mg was mounted on the cold finger of a closed-cycle displex refrigerator with the (h0\ell) plane of the reciprocal lattice coincident with the scattering plane of the diffractometer, allowing us to search for magnetic scattering at the reciprocal lattice positions for the A-type AFM structure [(h0\ell) with h+\ell=2n+1], as found previously for CaCo_{2}As_{2},[27] and the G-type AFM structure [(h0\ell) with h and \ell odd], as found for the related compound BaMn_{2}As_{2}.[41]

High-resolution ARPES experiments were carried out using a Scienta R4000 electron analyzer and 140-eV photon energy at beamline 7.0.1 of the Advanced Light Source (ALS), Berkeley, California. The crystals were cleaved _in situ_ along the ab plane and measured at a pressure of \approx 4\times 10^{-11} mbar. The energy and momentum resolution were set to \sim 20 meV and \sim 0.3^{\circ}, respectively. The Fermi energy (E_{\rm F}) of the sample was referenced to that of a gold sample deposited _in situ_ on the sample holder. In our notation, the Brillouin zone (BZ) of SrCo_{2}As_{2} is that of the body-centered-tetragonal (I4/mmm) direct lattice and not that of the Co square lattice, and the (k_{x},k_{y},k_{z}) axes of the Brillouin zone are, as conventionally defined in the literature, in the directions of the direct lattice translation vectors (**a**,**b**,**c**), respectively.[3]

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements were carried out on ^{75}As (l=3/2, \gamma_{\rm N}/2\pi=7.2919 MHz/T) using a homemade phase-coherent spin-echo pulse spectrometer.

  ^{75}As-NMR spectra were obtained by sweeping the magnetic field H at a fixed frequency f=51.1 MHz. The magnetic field was applied parallel to either the crystal c axis or the ab plane. The origin of the NMR shift K=0 of the ^{75}As nucleus was determined by ^{75}As NMR measurements of GaAs. The ^{75}As nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T_{1}) was measured with a saturation recovery method.

For electronic structure calculations, we used the full-potential linear augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) [42] method with the local density approximation (LDA). [43] To obtain self-consistent charge and wave functions, we employed R_{\rm MT}\times k_{\rm max}=9.0 with muffin-tin radii R_{\rm MT}=2.3, 2.1, and 2.1 a.u. for Sr, Co, and As, respectively. 828 **k** points were selected in the irreducible Brillouin zone and calculations were iterated to reach the total energy convergence criterion, which was 0.01 mRy/cell, where a "cell" is a primitive cell containing one formula unit of five atoms. Our experimental lattice parameters in Table 1 for the I4/mmm structure of SrCo_{2}As_{2} (a=3.9471 A, c=11.801 A) were used in the calculations. To obtain the theoretical c-axis position z_{\rm As} of the As atom, its position was relaxed until the force on the As atom was smaller than 1 mRy/a.u., which gave z_{\rm As}=0.35146. This value is somewhat smaller than our experimental value z_{\rm As}=0.3588(1) in Table 1.

## III Crystallography and thermal expansion

### Powder x-ray diffraction: crystal structure

The laboratory-based powder XRD data for SrCo_{2}As_{2} are shown in Fig. 2(a), along with the two-phase Rietveld refinement fit including a fit to the adventitious Sn from the flux on the surface of the crystals prior to crushing them, the difference profile and Bragg positions for the main phase as well as for Sn. The parameters fitted during the refinement were the lattice parameters, As c-axis position parameter z_{\rm As}, isotropic thermal parameters, scale factor, zero shift, three resolution parameters, profile shape parameter, and asymmetry parameters. The Sn impurity phase fraction was found to be 4.9 wt%. The site occupancies of Sr, Co, and As were kept fixed at 100% during the final refinement cycle because allowing the occupancies to vary from this value did not improve the fit significantly. The lattice parameters and z_{\rm As} are listed in Table 1 along with the corresponding literature data for CaCo_{2}As_{2}

Figure 2: (Color online) Room-temperature powder XRD data for SrCo_{2}As_{2} along with the Rietveld refinement fit, Bragg peak positions, and difference profile from (a) a laboratory-based diffractometer with x-ray wavelength \lambda=1.5418 Å and (b) a synchrotron-based diffractometer with x-ray wavelength \lambda=0.6995 Å. A two-phase Rietveld refinement was performed to account for the peaks from a minor amount of Sn flux on the surfaces of each of the two crushed-crystal samples.

The designations “T” and “C” refer to the uncollapsed tetragonal and collapsed tetragonal structures, respectively. SrCo_{2}As_{2} has c/a and d_{\rm As-As} values intermediate between those of T-type BaCo_{2}As_{2} and cT-type CaCo_{2}As_{2}.

  SrCo_{2}As_{2}, and BaCo_{2}As_{2}.[27, 28, 29] Our data for SrCo_{2}As_{2} are in reasonable agreement with those of Ref. [28].

The synchrotron x-ray diffraction pattern for SrCo_{2}As_{2}, the Rietveld profile refinement fit and residuals are displayed in Fig. 2(b). Here again, an impurity phase of adventitious Sn flux, comprising in this sample approximately 1% of the sample by weight, was included in the refinement of the powder diffraction pattern. A small section of low-angle data was removed from the refinement due to poor statistics. Several very low-intensity peaks could not be identified conclusively with other impurity phases. Table 1 gives a summary of the results of the refinement of the powder XRD data for the SrCo_{2}As_{2} phase. These data are in good agreement with those found above from the laboratory-based x-ray diffraction measurements.

Single-crystal x-ray diffraction: thermal expansion and search for a temperature-induced orthorhombic distortion

The T dependencies of the a and c lattice parameters were extracted from the positions of the (2 0 8) and (0 0 8) Bragg peaks measured by single-crystal x-ray diffraction as described in Sec. II. Figure 3(a) shows a striking _decrease_ in the c lattice parameter by approximately 0.3% as T_increases_ from our base temperature of 7.4 to 300 K, corresponding to a negative thermal expansion coefficient along the c axis over the full T range of the measurement. In contrast, the a lattice parameter _increases_ by \approx 0.35% with increasing T over the same T interval, which corresponds to the usual positive thermal expansion coefficient. The volume thermal expansion in Fig. 3(b) initially decreases on heating above 8 K and then increases from \approx 80 K to room temperature.

Negative thermal expansion coefficients in the paramagnetic states of materials are unusual. Indeed, the anisotropic thermal expansion coefficients above the coupled structural and magnetic transitions in crystals of the AFe_{2}As_{2} high-T_{\rm c} parent compounds [44] and in Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} crystals with x= 0.038 and 0.074 (Ref. [45]) are all positive. On the other hand, Ca_{1-x}La_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} crystals with x= 0.15, 0.20, and 0.25 all show temperature regions where the a- and/or c-axis and volume expansion coefficients are negative.[46] These latter behaviors are suggested by the authors to originate from proximity to a structural phase transition.

Our thermal expansion data in Fig. 3 reveal no obvious evidence for a temperature-induced lattice distortion in SrCo_{2}As_{2}. We therefore specifically searched for an orthorhombic lattice distortion, using high-resolution single-crystal x-ray diffraction, that might be associated with the observed negative c-axis and volume thermal expansion coefficients. However, no splitting or changes of peak shape were observed in the temperature range 10-300 K for the (2 0 8) or (1 1 8) reflections measured in the (h 0 \ell) and (h h \ell) scattering planes, respectively, demonstrating that no tetragonal to orthorhombic lattice distortion occurs over this T range to within an estimated upper limit for a potential distortion of (a-b)/(a+b) \leqslant 2.5 \times 10^{-4}.

## IV Electrical resistivity

Figure 4 shows the ab-plane \rho(T) of SrCo_{2}As_{2}. The data exhibit metallic behavior with a high residual resistivity ratio RRR \equiv\rho(300 K)/\rho(3 K) = 15.3, indicating good crystal quality. At low temperatures (3.5 K \leqslantT\leqslant 38 K), we find that \rho(T) follows \rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{2} (inset of Fig. 4) as expected for a Fermi liquid.[47] A fit by this equation gives \rho_{0}=12.0\mu\Omega cm and A= 8.21(4) \times 10^{-3}\mu\Omega cm/K^{2}.

The data over the entire T range could not be fitted well solely by the sum of a T-independent term \rho_{0} and the Bloch-Gruneisen prediction for carrier scattering by longitudinal lattice vibrations in the absence of umklapp scattering given by [48, 49]

\[\rho_{\rm{BG}}(T)=4{\cal R}\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{\rm{R}}}\right)^{5}\int_{0} ^{\Theta_{\rm{R}}/T}\frac{x^{5}}{(e^{x}-1)(1-e^{-x})}\,dx,\] (1a) where \[\Theta_{\rm{R}}\] is the Debye temperature obtained from fitting resistivity measurements and \[{\cal R}\] is a material-dependent scale

Figure 3: (Color online) Temperature dependence of (a) the a and c lattice parameters (right- and left-hand ordinates, respectively), (b) unit cell volume \[V_{\rm{cell}}=a^{2}c\] and (c) \[c/a\] ratio of SrCo_{2}As_{2} from single-crystal x-ray diffraction measurements.

  factor that is independent of T. Equation (1a) yields

\[\rho(T=\Theta_{\rm R})\approx 0.946\,464\,{\cal R}.\] (1b)

At high temperatures T\gtrsim\Theta_{\rm R}, the BG model yields a \rho_{\rm BG}(T) that is proportional to T, whereas the experimental data in Fig. 4 show negative curvature at high T. Therefore we also used a Mott interband sd scattering term -DT^{3} (Refs. [50, 51]) to fit the data according to

\[\rho(T)=\rho_{0}+\rho_{\rm BG}(T)-DT^{3}.\] (1c)

This fit function is not accurate at low T because the data below 38 K follow a T^{2} dependence as shown in the inset of Fig. 4 and discussed above, whereas \rho_{\rm BG}(T) has a T^{5} dependence at low T. Furthermore, we used the high-accuracy analytic dimensionless Pade approximant \rho_{\rm n}(T/\Theta_{\rm R}) in Ref. [48] in place of Eq. (1a) to facilitate the least-squares fit to the data, where

\[\rho_{\rm BG}(T)=\rho(\Theta_{\rm R})\rho_{\rm n}(T/\Theta_{\rm R}).\] (1d)

A good fit of the experimental \rho(T) data in Fig. 4 by Eq. (1) was obtained (black curve in Fig. 4), where the fitted parameters are \rho_{0}=13.3(1)\mu\Omega cm, \rho(\Theta_{\rm R})=104(1)\mu\Omega cm, \Theta_{\rm R}=167(1) K, and D=9.1(1)\times 10^{-7}\mu\Omega cm K^{-3}. From the value of \rho(\Theta_{\rm R}) and Eq. (1b), we obtain {\cal R}=110\mu\Omega cm. A significant contribution from the Mott sd interband scattering is expected in materials where narrow d bands appear at the Fermi level, for example in elemental Pd metal. [50] Since the ARPES data and the band structure calculations presented below show that an extremely narrow d band is present at E_{\rm F} in SrCo_{2}As_{2}, a substantial contribution from Mott sd interband scattering is not surprising.

## V Arpes

We studied the electronic properties of a SrCo_{2}As_{2} single crystal using high-resolution ARPES, which can directly probe the low-energy electronic excitations as a function of binding energy and momentum. Figure 5(a) shows the photoemission intensity map, which is obtained by integrating over an energy window of \pm 10 meV with respect to the Fermi energy E_{\rm F}, measured with a photon energy of 140 eV and sample temperature of 90 K. We clearly see four patches of intensity arranged around the center (\Gamma point) of the Brillouin zone (BZ), which are located at \pm\pi/a along the k_{x} and k_{y} directions. More interesting is the observation of a large {\bf k}-independent intensity near E_{\rm F} along the [\pm 1,\pm 1] directions passing through the corners (X points) of the BZ. This indicates the presence of a flat band near E_{\rm F} that extends over a large fraction of the second BZ. Our LDA band structure calculations in Fig. 8(c) below confirm the presence of a flat d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} band situated at or very close to E_{\rm F} that passes through the X points in the [\pm 1,\pm 1] directions, where here the x and y axes are along the a and b axes of the Co square lattice, respectively. A wide flat band just above E_{\rm F} with an associated very sharp peak in the density of states was also present in previous LDA band calculations for KCo_{2}As_{2}. [52]

Energy distribution curves (EDCs) for fixed momenta moving along the white line at the top of Fig. 5(c) are shown in Fig. 6(a), and an enlargement of the EDC in bold blue in Fig. 6(a) is plotted in Fig. 6(b). This shows in more detail a large and sharp peak in the quasiparticle density of states at E_{\rm F} as expected from the flat band near E_{\rm F} and associated sharp peak in the density of states identified in the band structure calculations. We speculate that the anomalous c-axis thermal expansion behavior and perhaps some of the magnetic properties we observe for SrCo_{2}As_{2} are driven by the presence of this flat band at or near E_{\rm F}.

In general, this Fermi surface (FS) is very different from those of other related parent compounds of the 122 family like BaFe_{2}As_{2} and SrFe_{2}As_{2}, where the hole FSs at \Gamma and the electron FSs at X are roughly circular in shape and similar in size. [53] To gain more insight about the character of the FS pockets, in Figs. 5(b) and 5(c) we show the energy-momentum ARPES intensity maps along two different cuts, marked by the white [across the \Gamma (0,0) point] and black [across the X (\pi/a,-\pi/a) point] bars in Fig. 5(a). In Fig. 5(b), one can

Figure 5: (Color online) (a) The Fermi surfaces of SrCo_{2}As_{2} measured with 140 eV photon energy and at 90 K sample temperature. The photoemission intensity maps are obtained by integrating over an energy window of \pm 10 meV with respect to the Fermi level. The outline of the first Brillouin zone (BZ) is shown by the white dashed square. (b) Band dispersion data plotted through the center [\Gamma point, horizontal white line in (a)] of the BZ from {\bf k}=(\sim-\pi/a,0) to (\sim\pi/a,0) and (c) through the corner [X point (\pi/a,-\pi/a), black line in (a)] of the BZ described by {\bf k}=(\frac{\pi}{a},-\frac{\pi}{a})+{\bf k}_{a}, where {\bf k}_{a}=(k_{x},k_{x}) and k_{a} ranges from zero to \approx\pm 1.2\pi/a. The black vertical arrows at the tops of (b) and (c) denote the Fermi wave vector positions for the electron Fermi surface pockets centered at \Gamma and X, respectively.

  observe a rather weak but discernible electron-like FS pocket at the \Gamma point and two additional small electron pockets at \pm\pi/a. A general observation in Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} is that with increasing x (electron doping), the central hole pockets at \Gamma become electron-like, while the X pockets remain electron-like and keep expanding on the overdoped side of the phase diagram (see, e.g., the ARPES data for the x=0.42 sample in Ref. [54]). An electron pocket at the center of the BZ [Fig. 5(b)] for SrCo_{2}As_{2} is expected and is in overall agreement with our previous study of Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2}.[54] The pocket at the X point is also electron-like, but much larger in size [Fig. 5(c)], so there is no obvious Fermi surface nesting in SrCo_{2}As_{2}.

We extracted the Fermi momenta of the electron pockets from the peaks in the momentum distribution curves at E_{\rm F} (not shown), and were found to be about +0.2 A^{-1} [vertical black arrows at the top of Fig. 5(b)] and \pm 0.7 A^{-1} [vertical black arrows at the top of Fig. 5(c)] centered at the \Gamma and X points, respectively. Figure 5(b) also shows that the top of the hole band at the \Gamma point has moved from above E_{\rm F} for the AFe_{2}As_{2} compounds to about 400 meV below E_{\rm F} due to Co contributing one conduction electron more than Fe. This leads to the disappearance of the hole-like Fermi surface around the \Gamma point as discussed above[54] and is consistent with our recent ARPES study of BaCo_{2}As_{2}.[55] In particular, the energies of the top and bottom of the valence band at the \Gamma and X points, the size of the electron pockets surrounding the \Gamma point, and the location and extent of the flat band at the X point are very similar for both materials.

## VI Band structure calculations

The top and bottom panels of Fig. 7 are atom- and orbital-decomposed densities of states (DOS), which were calculated with 1631 **k** points in the irreducible BZ. The top panel shows strongly hybridized bonding states between Co and As atoms in the energy range from 3 to 6 eV below E_{\rm F}. There are also antibonding empty states but they are located outside of the energy range shown. It also shows, near E_{\rm F}, a strong peak,

Figure 6: (Color online) (a) Energy distribution curves (EDCs) at fixed wave vector as the wave vector is scanned through the \Gamma point along the white bar at the top of Fig. 5(c), which is from k_{u}=0.52\,\pi/a to 1.19\,\pi/a. The EDC highlighted in bold blue is at k_{u}=0.85\,\pi/a. The Fermi energy E_{\rm F} is at the zero of energy on the horizontal scale. (b) Enlargement of the EDC at k_{u}=0.85\,\pi/a that is plotted in bold blue in (a). The sharp quasiparticle peak near E_{\rm F} arises from a flat electron band with a sharp peak in the density of states near E_{\rm F}.

Figure 7: (Color online) (Top panel) Total and atom-decomposed density of states (DOS) of SrCo_{2}As_{2} versus energy E. (Bottom panel) Orbital-decomposed contributions of the Co 3d atoms to the DOS. The peak in the total DOS near E_{\rm F}=0 is mostly contributed by the Co atoms. The DOS shows three peaks in the energy range shown. The peak near E_{\rm F} is mainly from the d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} flat-band component, and the second peak near 1.2 eV below E_{\rm F} is from the d_{xz}, d_{yz} components, which are degenerate in tetragonal symmetry. The third peak near 1.5 eV below E_{\rm F} is from the d_{xy} and d_{z^{2}} components. The ordinate scales of the DOS are different in the two panels because the top panel is for all atoms whereas the bottom panel is for the Co atoms separately.

  which is mostly of Co d character. It is well known that a system that has a high DOS or peak at E_{\rm F} is unstable and has a tendency to split the peak (lower the total energy) via physical transformations such as magnetic or structural transitions.[56] Therefore it might be expected that SrCo_{2}As_{2} also shows peculiar temperature- or pressure-dependent properties, which depend on the precise peak position.

The bottom panel of Fig. 7 shows the orbital-decomposed Co atom DOS in a small energy range (from 2 eV below to 1 eV above E_{\rm F}) to emphasize the orbital contributions to the peak near E_{\rm F}. The d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} orbital points towards neighboring Co atoms in the xy plane and is a dominant contributor, where the x and y axes are defined here to be along the a and b axes of the Co square lattice, respectively. It suggests a possibility to control the peak size or position by Co-Co distance modification.

Thus the very sharp peak in the DOS near E_{\rm F} in Fig. 7(a) arises from a Co d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} flat band extending over a large fraction of the second BZ. The band structure density of states at E_{\rm F} is

\[\mathcal{D}^{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})=11.04\;{\rm states/(eV\;f.u.)}\;{\rm both\; spins}.\] (2)

Figure 8 shows a Fermi surface (FS) plot and band structures for three different cuts in **k** space. For the Fermi surface calculation, we divided the -2\pi/a<k_{x}, k_{y}<2\pi/a range of k_{x},k_{y} planes with different k_{z} values into a 200\times 200 mesh that gives 40401 **k** points. Figure 8(a) shows the result with k_{z}=1.88(\pi/c) and also shows three cutting lines for band structure calculations. The cutting line #1 is from (-2\pi/a,0,z) to (2\pi/a,0,z), #2 is from (0,-2\pi/a,z) to (2\pi/a,0,z), and cutting line #3 is from (-2\pi/a,2\pi/a,z) to (2\pi/a,2\pi/a,z), with z=1.88(\pi/c). These cutting lines #1-#3 correspond to the band structure plots Figs. 8(b)-8(d), respectively. Figure 8(c) shows the d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} flat band that is largely responsible for the sharp high peak in the DOS near E_{\rm F}.

## VII Heat capacity

The C_{\rm p} of SrCo_{2}As_{2} is plotted versus T in Fig. 9. The value of C_{\rm p} at 240 K is 124 J/mol K, which is close to the Dulong-Petit high-T limit of the lattice heat capacity at constant volume given by C_{\rm V}=15R\approx 124.7\;{\rm J/mol\;K}, where R is the molar gas constant. The inset in Fig. 9 shows a conventional C_{\rm p}/T versus T^{2} plot for T\leqslant 10 K where the data are fitted by the expression

\[C_{\rm p}/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4},\] (3)

which is the sum of electronic (\gamma T) and low-T lattice (\beta T^{3}+\delta T^{5}) heat capacity contributions. The fitted values of

Figure 8: (Color online) Plots of (a) the Fermi surface and (b)–(d) the band structure of SrCo_{2}As_{2} calculated at k_{z}=1.88(\pi/c). The lines (#1-#3) in (a) are cutting lines for band structure plot directions and correspond to panels (b)–(d), respectively. The lattice parameters a and c are those of the body-centered tetragonal unit cell of SrCo_{2}As_{2} given in Sec. II.

  the Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma and the lattice coefficients \beta and \delta are listed in Table 2. The value of \gamma = 37.8(1) mJ/mol K2 is very large compared to those of the parent iron arsenide compounds AFe_{2}As_{2} (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) in the stripe AFM state.[57, 58, 59] Additional C_{\rm p}(T) data at H = 3 T down to 1.3 K revealed no new features (not shown).

The density of states at the Fermi energy for both spin directions \mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F}), including many-body enhancement effects due to the electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions, is calculated from

\[\gamma=\frac{\pi^{2}k_{\rm B}^{2}}{3}\mathcal{D}^{\gamma}(E_{\rm F}).\] (4)

Using the above value of \gamma yields

\[\mathcal{D}^{\gamma}(E_{\rm F})=16.0(3)\;{\rm states}/{\rm eV}\,{\rm f}.{\rm u}.\] (5)

for both spin directions. This value is 1.45 times the band theory value of 11.04 states/(eV f.u.) (see Table 2). Writing \gamma=\nu_{\rm band}(1+\lambda_{\rm el-ph})m^{*}/m_{\rm band}, where \gamma_{\rm band} and m_{\rm band} are the band theory values of \gamma and the current carrier effective mass, \lambda_{\rm el-ph} is the electron-phonon coupling constant and m^{*}/m_{\rm band} is the electronic many-body conduction carrier mass enhancement over the band theory value, gives

\[(1+\lambda_{\rm el-ph})m^{*}/m_{\rm band}\approx 1.45.\] (6)

A similar analysis of \gamma obtained at low T has been done for paramagnetic BaCo_{2}As_{2}, where the authors find[24]

\[\gamma = 41.0\;{\rm mJ/mol\,K^{2}},\] (7a) \[\mathcal{D}^{\gamma}(E_{\rm F})=17.4\;{\rm states/eV}\,{\rm f}.{ \rm u}.,\] (7b) \[(1+\lambda_{\rm el-ph})m^{*}/m_{\rm band}\approx 2.0.\] (7c)

The \gamma and \mathcal{D}^{\gamma}(E_{\rm F}) values of SrCo_{2}As_{2} and BaCo_{2}As_{2}, respectively, are seen to be nearly the same. The difference between the combined electron-phonon and electronic mass enhancements in Eqs. (6) and (7c) arises mainly from the difference in the band structure densities of states of the two compounds.

The Debye temperature \Theta_{\rm D} is obtained from the value of \beta according to

\[\Theta_{\rm D}=\left(\frac{12\pi^{4}Rn}{5\beta}\right)^{1/3},\] (8)

where \beta is normalized to a mole of formula units (f.u.) and n = 5 is the number of atoms per f.u. Thus we obtain \Theta_{\rm D} = 251(1) K. This value is much larger than the value \Theta_{\rm R} = 167(1) K obtained above in Sec. IV from the Bloch-Gruneisen fit to \rho(T). This discrepancy may be associated with the unusual negative thermal expansion characteristics discussed in Sec. III.2 above and/or with T-dependent spin fluctuation effects discussed in Sec. IX below and associated magnetoelastic coupling effects.

The Kadowaki-Woods (KW) ratio is R_{\rm KW} = A/\gamma^{2} = 5.7 x 10^{-3} m\Omega cm mol^{2} J^{-2} K^{2}, similar to those observed in strongly-correlated electron metals and heavy fermion compounds,[60] thus suggesting the presence of strong electron correlations in SrCo_{2}As_{2}.

The C_{\rm p}(T) data in the entire T range of measurement were fitted by

\[C_{\rm p}(T)=\gamma\,T+n\,C_{\rm V\,Debye}(T),\] (9a) where \gamma was fixed at the above-determined value 37.8 mJ/mol K2 and n = 5 is the number of atoms/f.u. The function C_{\rm V\,Debye}(T) is the Debye lattice heat capacity at constant volume per mole of atoms due to acoustic phonons given by[61]

\[C_{\rm V\,Debye}(T)=9\,R\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{\rm D}}\right)^{3}\int_{0}^{ \Theta_{\rm D}/T}\frac{x^{4}e^{x}}{(e^{x}-1)^{2}}\,dx,\] (9b)

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c}  & SrCo_{2}As_{2} & BaCo_{2}As_{2} \\ Parameter & (This work) & (Refs. [24] and [63]) \\ \hline \gamma (ml/mol K2) & 37.8(1) & 41.0 \\ \beta (ml/mol K4) & 0.611(7) & 0.47 \\ \delta (\muJ/mol K6) & 1.01(9) & \\ \mathcal{D}^{\gamma}(E_{\rm F})^{\alpha} & 16.0(3) & 17.4 \\ \mathcal{D}^{\gamma}(E_{\rm F})^{\alpha} & 54 & 90 \\ R  where \Theta_{\rm D} is the Debye temperature. A high-accuracy analytic Pade approximant[48] for the Debye function in Eq. (9b) was used for fitting the C_{\rm p}(T) data, which greatly facilitates the fit. The \Theta_{\rm D} derived from the least-squares fit of the data over the full T range in Fig. 9 by Eq. (9a) is 304(3) K as listed in Table 2. This value of \Theta_{\rm D} is significantly larger than the value of 251(1) K determined above from fitting the C_{\rm p} data at low T<10 K by Eq. (3). Furthermore, the goodness of fit obtained is poor, evident from the large systematic deviations of the fit from the data in Fig. 9 compared to the much better fits we recently obtained for other 122-type compounds.[27, 48] This unusually large deviation between the two \Theta_{\rm D} values might be related to the negative thermal expansion reported in Sec. III.2 and/or magnetoelastic coupling effects arising from strongly T-dependent spin fluctuations. The parameters of the above fits and derived quantities are summarized in Table 2.

## VIII Magnetization and Magnetic Susceptibility

The isothermal magnetization M of a SrCo_{2}As_{2} single crystal versus H for H\parallel c and H\parallel ab plane are shown in Figs. 10(a) and 10(b), respectively. The M is proportional to H for the entire T and H ranges of the measurements for both field directions, showing that the crystal does not contain detectable ferromagnetic (FM) or saturable PM impurities. Therefore the susceptibility can be defined at arbitrary field H as \chi=M(H)/H.

The anisotropic magnetic susceptibilities \chi_{ab} and \chi_{c} of SrCo_{2}As_{2} in H=3 T are plotted versus T in Fig. 11, where \chi_{c}\equiv\chi(H\parallel c) and \chi_{ab}\equiv\chi(H\parallel ab plane). The \chi(T) data for both field directions exhibit broad maxima at \approx 115 K followed by shallow minima at \approx 20 K and smooth low-T upturns below 20 K, with no evidence for long-range magnetic ordering. A very similar broad maximum in \chi at about the same temperature was observed for isostructural KFe_{2}As_{2}.[62] The maximum in \chi(T) for that compound was attributed to a crossover from a coherent to an incoherent Fermi liquid state with increasing T.[62]

The T dependences of the ^{75}As NMR Knight shift K(T) data in Fig. 16(a) below are in overall agreement with the \chi(T) data in Fig. 11, except that the K(T) data do not show the upturns seen in the \chi(T) data below \approx 20 K. This difference indicates that these upturns in \chi(T) are not intrinsic and therefore likely arise from paramagnetic impurities or defects that are not saturable in our field range (see Fig. 10). The Knight shift data from Fig. 16(a) are therefore scaled onto the respective low-T\chi(T) data in Fig. 11 as shown by the solid curves, which represent the intrinsic \chi(T) at low T. The intrinsic values for SrCo_{2}As_{2} at 4.3 K are found to be

\[\chi_{c}(0) = 1.61\times 10^{-3}\;\rm cm^{3}/mol,\] (10a) \[\chi_{ab}(0) = 1.82\times 10^{-3}\;\rm cm^{3}/mol,\] (10b) \[\chi_{\rm P}(0) = 1.75\times 10^{-3}\;\rm cm^{3}/mol,\] (10c)

where the powder-averaged susceptibility \chi_{\rm P} is

\[\chi_{\rm P}=\tfrac{1}{3}\chi_{c}+\tfrac{2}{3}\chi_{ab}.\] (10d)

Figure 11: (Color online) Anisotropic magnetic susceptibility \chi=M/H versus temperature T (where M is magnetization and H is applied magnetic field) of SrCo_{2}As_{2} measured at H=3 T. From our NMR Knight shift measurements in Fig. 16(a) below, the upturns in \chi(T) below about 20 K are not intrinsic. The solid curves are these Knight shift data scaled onto the low-T\chi(T) data, allowing estimates of the intrinsic \chi(T\to 0) values to be obtained as given in Eq. (10). Inset: Fit of the powder-averaged susceptibility \chi_{P} versus T for 200 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K by the Curie-Weiss law in Eq. (20) with \chi_{0}=0 (Fit 1 in Table 2). Fits 1 and 2 are indistinguishable on the scale of the inset.

Figure 10: (Color online) Isothermal magnetization M of SrCo_{2}As_{2} versus applied magnetic field H at the indicated temperatures for H parallel to (a) the c axis and (b) the ab plane.

  The effective density of states at E_{\rm F} for both spin directions {\cal D}^{x}(E_{\rm F}) obtained from magnetic susceptibility measurements is calculated from \chi_{\rm P}(0) for g=2 using the expression

\[\chi_{\rm P}(0)=\mu_{\rm B}^{2}{\cal D}^{x}(E_{\rm F}),\] (11)

yielding a large density of states

\[{\cal D}^{x}(E_{\rm F})=54\;{\rm states}/({\rm eV}\;{\rm f.u.}).\] (12)

The anisotropy in \chi is small with \chi_{ab}(0) slightly larger than \chi_{c}(0). The sign of the anisotropy is opposite to that in the PM state of CaCo_{2}As_{2} (Refs. [25] and [26]) and in BaCo_{2}As_{2}.[24, 63]

For comparison, from the high-field slopes from 2 to 6.5 T of the M(H) data for BaCo_{2}As_{2} at T=1.8 K in the inset of Fig. 1 of Ref. [24], we obtain [63]

\[\chi_{c}(0) = 3.28\times 10^{-3}\;{\rm cm}^{3}/{\rm mol},\] (13a) \[\chi_{ab}(0) = 2.72\times 10^{-3}\;{\rm cm}^{3}/{\rm mol}\;({\rm BaCo}_{2}{ \rm As}_{2}),\] (13b) \[\chi_{\rm P}(0) = 2.91\times 10^{-3}\;{\rm cm}^{3}/{\rm mol}.\] (13c)

These values are \sim 70\% larger than our respective values at 4.3 K for SrCo_{2}As_{2} in Eq. (10). The density of states calculated from \chi_{\rm P}(0) for BaCo_{2}As_{2} using Eq. (11) is

\[{\cal D}^{x}(E_{\rm F})=90\;{\rm states}/({\rm eV}\;{\rm f.u.})\quad({\rm BaCo }_{2}{\rm As}_{2}).\] (14)

### Stoner enhancement and the Wilson ratio: a conundrum

In an itinerant picture, the Stoner-enhanced susceptibility at {\bf q}=0 and T=0 is [64]

\[\chi=\frac{\chi_{0}}{1-{\cal D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})I/4}\equiv\frac{\chi_{0}} {1-F},\] (15)

where \chi_{0} is the conduction carrier spin susceptibility calculated from the band-structure density of states at E_{\rm F} as in Eq. (11), I\sim 0.8 eV is the Stoner factor for Co (Ref. [24]) and the factor of 1/4 arises due to the presence of two Co atoms per f.u. and from the two spin directions counted in {\cal D}(E_{\rm F}). Using {\cal D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})=11.04\;{\rm states}/({\rm eV}\;{\rm f.u.}) from Eq. (2) and I=0.8 eV gives

\[F=2.2>1,\] (16)

which from comparison with Eq. (15) indicates that SrCo_{2}As_{2} should have a FM ground state. This inference is wrong because it strongly disagrees with our M(H) and \chi(T) data in Figs. 10 and 11, respectively.

The Wilson ratio R_{\rm W} is defined as

\[R_{\rm W}\equiv\frac{{\cal D}^{x}(E_{\rm F})}{{\cal D}^{\gamma}(E_{\rm F})}.\] (17)

Within an itinerant picture, if R_{\rm W}\sim 1-2, \chi and \gamma are approximately equally enhanced above the band structure prediction, indicating that any enhancement of \chi and \gamma is due to a many-body enhancement of {\cal D}(E_{\rm F}). On the other hand, if R_{\rm W}\gg 1 or R_{\rm W}\ll 1, one would infer that strong FM or AFM conduction spin correlations are present, respectively, which change \chi but not \gamma.[65] Using the values of {\cal D}^{x}(E_{\rm F}) and {\cal D}^{\gamma}(E_{\rm F}) in Eqs. (12) and (5), respectively, Eq. (17) gives

\[R_{\rm W}=3.5\quad{\rm for}\quad{\rm SrCo}_{2}{\rm As}_{2}.\] (18)

As discussed above, this large value of R_{\rm W} indicates a significant FM enhancement of \chi, qualitatively consistent with the large value of the factor F derived above.

These indications of dominant FM correlations between the itinerant current carriers in SrCo_{2}As_{2} are at odds with the broad maximum in \chi(T) at about 115 K in Fig. 11, which instead suggests the dominance of low-dimensional AFM correlations, [7] and with the linear M(H) behaviors in Fig. 10 that show no tendency towards saturation. Indeed, inelastic neutron scattering measurements on this compound showed strong AFM fluctuations at the stripe AFM wave vector,[23] but preliminary searches for FM spin fluctuations in the first BZ yielded no detectable signal. On the other hand, electronic structure calculations of the static \chi({\bf q}) showed enhancements at both the FM and stripe AFM wave vectors.[23] Interestingly, enhancements of \chi({\bf q}) at the same two wave vectors are found from electronic structure calculations and \chi measurements of the FeAs-based materials.[3, 31]

A similar analysis of \chi and C_{\rm p} data for isostructural BaCo_{2}As_{2} yielded a similar conclusion about the importance of FM itinerant spin correlations in this compound.[24] Using the densities of states for BaCo_{2}As_{2} in Eqs. (7b) and (14), one obtains the value of the Wilson ratio from Eq. (17) as

\[R_{\rm W}=5.2\quad{\rm for}\quad{\rm BaCo}_{2}{\rm As}_{2}.\] (19)

This value is larger than for SrCo_{2}As_{2} in Eq. (18), suggesting stronger FM correlations in this compound. The authors of Ref. [24] suggested that the suppression of long-range FM order in BaCo_{2}As_{2} results from strong spin fluctuations associated with a nearby quantum critical point.

### Curie-Weiss model

Above \approx 200 K, the \chi(T) of SrCo_{2}As_{2} resembles a Curie-Weiss-like (CW) behavior

\[\chi=\chi_{0}+\frac{C}{T-\theta_{\rm p}}.\] (20)

The values of the Curie constant C and Weiss temperature \theta_{\rm p} obtained by fitting \chi_{\rm P}(T) between 200 and 300 K, assuming \chi_{0}=0 (Fit 1), are listed in Table 3. In a second fit, the \chi_{0} value was allowed to vary, yielding a different set of fit parameters (Fit 2) in Table 3. Fit 1 is shown as the red curve in the inset of Fig. 11; both fits to the data are equally good and cannot be distinguished on the scale of the inset. In a local-moment

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c} Parameter & Fit 1 & Fit 2 \\ \chi_{0} (10^{-4}cm^{3}/mol) & \equiv 0 & -4(2) \\ C (cm^{3} K/mol) & 0.65(1) & 1.0(2) \\ g & 1.86(2) & 2.3(2) \\ \mu_{\rm eff}(\mu_{\rm B}/Co) & 1.61(2) & 2.0(2)  model, the Curie constant per mole of spins is given by

\[C = \frac{N_{\rm A}g^{2}S(S + 1)\mu_{\rm B}^{2}}{3k_{\rm B}},\]

where _N_A is Avogadro's number, g is the spectroscopic splitting factor (_g_ factor), S is the spin quantum number, _m_B is the Bohr magneton, and _k_B is Boltzmann's constant. The corresponding effective magnetic moment is computed from

\[\mu_{\rm eff} = g\sqrt{S(S + 1)}\,\mu_{\rm B}/{\rm Co}.\]

The calculated values of g and _m_eff for the two fits taking S = 1/2 are given in Table 3.

For an interacting local moment Heisenberg model \mathcal{H} = \sum_{\left\langle ij \right\rangle}J_{i}\mathbf{S}_{i} \cdot \mathbf{S}_{j} for identical crystallographically equivalent spins, one has [66]

\[\theta_{\rm p} = - \frac{S(S + 1)}{3k_{\rm B}}\sum_{j}J_{ij},\]

where the sum is over all interacting neighbors j of a given spin i. Within the J1-_J_2 model for the square Co lattice where J1 and J2 are the four nearest- and four next-nearest-neighbor exchange interactions, respectively, and using S = 1/2, one obtains

\[\theta_{\rm p} = - \frac{J_{1} + J_{2}}{k_{\rm B}}.\]

Our _th_p values then give

\[\frac{J_{1} + J_{2}}{k_{\rm B}} = 102(7)\,\,\,{\rm K}\quad({\rm Fit}\,\,1),\]

\[\frac{J_{1} + J_{2}}{k_{\rm B}} = 180(50)\,\,\,{\rm K}\quad({\rm Fit}\,\,2),\]

which are strongly antiferromagnetic. We emphasize that the values of C, _m_eff, _th_p, and J1 + J2 may be in error because the CW fit to the _kh_(_T_) data may not have been done at sufficiently high temperatures for the CW law to accurately describe the data, and/or because SrCo2As2 may be an itinerant magnetic system instead of a local-moment one.

The results of _kh_(_T_) measurements on a polycrystalline SrCo2As2 sample were reported earlier by Leithe-Jasper _et al._[18] The authors found that SrCo2As2 is a CW paramagnet showing no magnetic ordering above 1.8 K with C = 0.53 cm3 K/mol and _th_p = -29 K. These C and |_th_p| values are both significantly smaller than our values in Table 3 for a single crystal, and these authors did not report observing the maximum in _kh_(_T_) that we observe at 115 K in Fig. 11 for both field orientations and therefore which also occurs for the polycrystalline average.

### Interconfigurational fluctuation (ICF) model

As discussed above, in an itinerant picture one expects SrCo2As2 and BaCo2As2 to be ferromagnetic. The observed absence of ferromagnetism in these compounds suggests that strong spin fluctuation effects prevent the occurrence of long-range FM ordering, perhaps due to proximity to a quantum critical point.[24] The observed broad maximum in _kh_(_T_) in Fig. 11 and the large magnitude of _th_p in Table 3 can then be analyzed within a phenomenological interconfigurational fluctuation (ICF) model where the average fluctuating valence of the magnetic ions in a material is _T_-dependent.[67, 68] For this model, at high T we find a CW-like _kh_(_T_) with a negative (AFM-like) Weiss temperature, as observed, which conflicts with the positive (FM-like) Weiss temperature expected if SrCo2As2 were near a FM instability. A many-body theory of intermediate-valence and interconfigurational fluctuation effects [69] has been applied to understand the _T_-dependent local moment [70] and associated anomalous T dependence of _kh_ (Ref. [3]) in the PM states of the iron arsenides.

The ICF model is derived from the _kh_ of an isolated two-level local-moment magnetic system. Here we apply it to local-moment _d_-electron systems with quenched orbital angular momentum (_L_z = 0). Spin-orbit coupling generally causes a deviation of g from the free-electron value g = 2 and the introduction of a paramagnetic Van Vleck orbital susceptibility. The ground state has energy E0 = 0, spin S0, and Zeeman degeneracy 2S0 + 1, and the excited state has energy E1, spin S1, and degeneracy 2S1 + 1. The spin susceptibility of this two-level system is then

\[\chi_{\rm two\mbox{-}level}(T) = P_{0}\chi_{0}(T) + P_{1}\chi_{1}(T),\]

where the probabilities of occupying state 0 or 1 are given by the Boltzmann distribution as

\[P_{i} = \frac{(2S_{i} + 1)e^{- E_{i}/k_{\rm B}T}}{(2S_{0} + 1) + (2S_{1} + 1)e^{- E_{i}/k_{\rm B}T}}\quad(i = 0,1).\]

The susceptibilities of the two levels are given by Curie laws as

\[\chi_{i}(T) = \frac{C_{i}}{T}\quad(i = 0,1)\]

with Curie constants

\[C_{i} = \frac{N_{\rm A}g_{i}^{2}S_{i}(S_{i} + 1)\mu_{\rm B}^{2}}{3k_{\rm B}}\quad(i = 0,1).\]

The phenomenological ICF susceptibility _kh_CF is derived from the above results for an isolated two-level system by making the replacement

\[T \to T^{\star}\]

in Eqs. (26), where [68]

\[T^{\star} = \sqrt{T^{2} + T_{\rm sf}^{2}}\quad({\rm model}\,\,1)\]

or [67]

\[T^{\star} = T + T_{\rm sf}\quad({\rm model}\,\,2)\]

and _T_sf is an effective spin fluctuation temperature that reflects the frequency of fluctuations in the spin state of the magnetic ion between S0 and S1.

We fitted our experimental _kh_(_T_) by

\[\chi(T) = \chi_{0} + \chi_{\rm ICF}(T),\]

where _kh_0 is the _T_-independent orbital susceptibility and _kh_ICF is the ICF spin susceptibility. We tried the combinations (_S_0,S1) = (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2,1), and (1, 2), but only the combination (_S_0,S1) = (0, 1) gave a satisfactory fit to the experimental data, for which Eqs. (26) and (27) yield

\[P_{1}(T) = \frac{3}{3 + e^{E_{1}/k_{\rm B}T}}\quad(S_{0} = 0,\,S_{1} = 1)\]  and, using \chi_{0}(T)=0 because S_{0}=0,

\[\chi_{\rm ICF}(T)=\frac{3C_{1}}{(3+e^{E_{1}/k_{\rm B}T})T^{*}}\quad(S_{0}=0,\,S_{ 1}=1).\] (29b)

Using the expression for T^{*} for model 1 in Eqs. (27), a high-T series expansion of Eq. (29b) gives

\[\chi_{\rm ICF}(T) = \frac{C_{\rm ICF}}{T}\bigg{[}1-\frac{E_{1}/k_{\rm B}}{4T}\] (29c) \[-\frac{(E_{1}/k_{\rm B})^{2}+8T_{\rm sf}^{2}}{16T^{2}}+{\cal O} \bigg{(}\frac{1}{T^{3}}\bigg{)}\bigg{]},\]

where

\[C_{\rm ICF}=\frac{3C_{1}}{4}\] (29d)

and T_{\rm sf} first appears in the third term. The factor of 3/4 arises because in the limit of high T the probability of occupying the triplet excited state is 3/4. In this limit, Eq. (29c) yields a Curie law

\[\chi_{\rm ICF}(T)=\frac{C_{\rm ICF}}{T},\] (29e)

where C_{\rm ICF} is the Curie constant of the two-level system at high T. Expanding the first two terms in Eq. (29c) in a Taylor series according to 1+x\approx 1/(1-x) gives a Curie-Weiss-like behavior

\[\chi_{\rm ICF}(T)=\frac{C_{\rm ICF}}{T-\theta_{\rm ICF}}\quad(T\gg\theta_{\rm ICF }),\] (29f)

where the Weiss temperature is

\[\theta_{\rm ICF}=-\frac{E_{1}}{4k_{\rm B}}\quad(\rm model\ 1)\] (30a) with a negative sign (AFM-like). It is interesting that this expression for \[\theta_{\rm ICF} in model 1 does not contain the ICF parameter \[T_{\rm sf}\] . Carrying out the same steps for model 2 gives a Curie-Weiss law ( 29f) with the same Curie constant but a different Weiss temperature \[\theta_{\rm ICF}=-\bigg{(}\frac{E_{1}}{4k_{\rm B}}+T_{\rm sf}\bigg{)}\quad( \rm model\ 2),\] (30b)

which for this model does contain T_{\rm sf}.

The values of the fitted parameters \chi_{0}, E_{1}, T_{\rm sf}, and g_{1} for models 1 and 2 using (S_{0},S_{1})=(0,1) are listed in Table 4 and the fits by the two models are shown in Fig. 12. Also listed in Table 4 are the values of C_{1}, C_{\rm ICF}, and \theta_{\rm ICF} derived from these parameters using Eqs. (26d), (29d), and (30), respectively. Although good fits are obtained using both models, the \chi_{0} value for the fit by model 2 is unphysically large and negative and even the value for model 1 is unusually negative. Furthermore, the values of C_{\rm ICF} and \theta_{\rm ICF} are much closer to the Curie-Weiss fit values in Table 3 for model 1 compared to model 2. However, we only expect the fitting parameters to be semiquantitative because the ICF model is phenomenological.

  for model 1 and the parameters in Table 4. Our thermal expansion measurements in Fig. 3(a) show that SrCo_{2}As_{2} exhibits anomalous negative thermal expansion along the c direction and positive thermal expansion in the basal plane, which results in a a/c ratio that is T dependent and increases with increasing T with a dependence similar to that in Fig. 13 [see Fig. 3(c)]. Thus the T dependence of a/c and the population P_{1}(T) are correlated within this model.

### J_{1}-J_{2} Heisenberg model with S=1/2

#### iii.4.1 Introduction

It is well known that low-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnets exhibit a \chi(T) that has a broad maximum due to the increasing dynamic short-range AFM correlations on cooling below the temperature of the maximum, in conjunction with the suppression of long-range AFM order due to quantum fluctuations associated with the low spin-lattice dimensionality.[7] In view of the inelastic neutron scattering results that demonstrated the occurrence of dynamic stripe-type AFM correlations in SrCo_{2}As_{2},[23] we consider in this section a description of our \chi(T) data in Fig. 11, which show a broad maximum, in terms of the J_{1}-J_{2} Heisenberg model for the two-dimensional (2D) spin-1/2 square lattice. Due to the Mermin-Wagner theorem,[71] a 2D Heisenberg spin lattice cannot exhibit static long-range AFM order at finite T. This result is due to fluctuation affects associated with the low dimensionality of the spin lattice. However, even weak interlayer coupling can induce long-range AFM order, but usually at a temperature significantly below the temperature of the broad peak in \chi(T).[72]

The J_{1}-J_{2} Heisenberg model with spins S=1/2 on a square lattice is well studied. The Hamiltonian in zero field is

\[{\cal H}=\sum_{\langle ij\rangle}J_{1}{\bf S}_{i}\cdot{\bf S}_{j}+\sum_{\langle ik \rangle}J_{2}{\bf S}_{i}\cdot{\bf S}_{j},\] (31)

where the first sum is over nearest-neighbor spin pairs along the legs of the square lattice and the second sum is over next-nearest-neighbor spin pairs along the diagonals of the squares, where positive J_{1} and J_{2} correspond to AFM interactions and negative ones to FM interactions. A stripe-type AFM phase as observed in the LaFeAsO and AFe_{2}As_{2} compounds occurs classically for J_{2}>0 and J_{2}/|J_{1}|>1/2, where J_{1} can be either positive (AFM) or negative (FM).[3] Early in the Fe-based high-T_{c} superconductivity field, this (effective) frustration model was used to explain the stripe-type AFM ordering observed in the 1111-type and 122-type iron arsenides in both the itinerant[73] and local moment[74] descriptions of the magnetism. The same stripe-type AFM ordering is predicted from band theory without reference to exchange interactions.[11, 12]

Our recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements on SrCo_{2}As_{2} indicate the presence of stripe-type AFM correlations with J_{1}<0 and J_{2}/J_{1}\approx-1,[23] which is consistent with the above classical constraints for stripe-type AFM correlations, and further indicated that the correlations are quasi-two-dimensional. We therefore proceed to analyze our \chi(T) data for SrCo_{2}As_{2} in terms of the frustrated 2D J_{1}-J_{2} spin-1/2 Heisenberg square lattice model.

#### iii.4.2 Determining J_{1} and J_{2} from \chi(T) data

In order to estimate the values of the exchange constants J_{1} and J_{2}, one can fit \chi(T) by the high-T series expansion (HTSE) for the spin susceptibility of this model which is given for J_{1}<0 and J_{2}>0 by[75]

\[\frac{\chi|J_{1}|}{Ng^{2}\mu_{\rm B}^{2}}=\frac{|J_{1}|}{k_{\rm B}T}\sum_{n=0 }^{9}\left(\frac{-|J_{1}|}{k_{\rm B}T}\right)^{n}\sum_{m=0}^{n}c_{m,n}\left( \frac{J_{2}}{J_{1}}\right)^{m},\] (32)

where N is the number of spins and a table of the c_{m,n} values is given in Ref. [75]. For a given value of J_{2}/J_{1}, we converted the sum over n into a Pade approximant {\cal P}[p,q] with [p,q]=[4,4], which is a ratio of two fourth-order polynomials in |J_{1}|/k_{\rm B}T (p=q=4), where the coefficients of the two polynomials are solved for exactly in terms of the original HTSE coefficients, which in turn results in an expression \chi_{\rm Pade}(T) for the susceptibility. The Pade approximant reformulation of the HTSE prediction for \chi decreases the minimum temperature at which the HTSE can be used to fit experimental data.

We fitted our \chi(T) data by

\[\chi(T)=\chi_{0}+\chi_{\rm Pade}(T,|J_{1}|,J_{2}/J_{1}).\] (33)

A fit of the experimental \chi_{ab}(T) data in Fig. 11 by Eq. (33) for J_{1}<0 and J_{2}/J_{1}=-1 was obtained, as dictated by the inelastic neutron scattering measurements,[25] and we also fixed g=2. The fit is shown in Fig. 14, where the fitting parameters \chi_{0} and J_{1} are given in the figure. The high-temperature series and Pade approximant derived from it are not expected to be valid to temperatures much below the temperature of the broad maximum, so we cut off the fit as shown. The value of \chi_{0} is perhaps too negative to be physical, which suggests that the model may not include all relevant exchange couplings.

#### iii.4.3 Extended 3D J_{1}-J_{2}-J_{c} spin S=1/2 Heisenberg model

The above fit of \chi(T) by the J_{1}-J_{2} model ignores the magnetic coupling between adjacent stacked Co square lattice layers along the c axis. To include this coupling, we utilize the above intralayer \chi_{\rm Pade}(T) in Eq. (33) as determined

Figure 14: (Color online) A fit of the ab-plane susceptibility \chi_{ab}(T) data for SrCo_{2}As_{2} from Fig. 11 (filled red circles) by the J_{1}-J_{2} spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on a square lattice according to Eq. (33) (blue curve). The fitting parameters are given in the figure where g=2 was assumed.

  from Eq. (32), but augment the J_{1}-J_{2} Heisenberg square lattice model by adding a nearest-neighbor c-axis Heisenberg coupling between the stacked square lattices using molecular field theory (MFT) as follows, where we utilize the fact that all Co spins are identical and crystallographically equivalent in SrCo_{2}As_{2}.

The time- and space-average magnetic moment component \mu_{i} in the direction of the applied field \mathbf{H} is

\[\mu_{i}=\frac{\chi_{\text{Padc}}}{N}(H+H_{\text{exch}\,c\,i}),\] (34a) where \[H_{\text{exch}\,c\,i}\] is the exchange field seen by \[\vec{\mu}_{i}\] due to the two moments in the two adjacent layers along the \[c\] axis. In MFT, one writes \[H_{\text{exch}\,c\,i}=\lambda_{c}\mu_{i},\] (34b) where \[\lambda_{c}\] is the MFT coupling constant of \[\vec{\mu}_{i}\] to the two moments in adjacent layers along the \[c\] axis. Substituting Eq. ( 34b ) into ( 34a ) and solving for \[\mu_{i}\] gives \[\mu_{i}=\frac{\chi_{\text{Padc}}H}{N}\frac{H}{1-\frac{2J_{\text{Padc}}}{N} \lambda_{c}},\] (34c) so the spin susceptibility per spin is \[\chi_{i}^{\text{spin}}=\frac{\mu_{i}}{H}=\frac{\chi_{\text{Padc}}/N}{1-\frac{ \chi_{\text{Padc}}}{N}\lambda_{c}},\] (34d) and for \[N\] spins one then obtains \[\chi^{\text{spin}}=\frac{\chi_{\text{Padc}}}{1-\frac{\chi_{\text{Padc}}}{N} \lambda_{c}}.\] (34e) Taking the reciprocal of each side of this equation gives \[\frac{1}{\chi^{\text{spin}}}=\frac{1}{\chi_{\text{Padc}}}-\frac{\lambda_{c}}{N}.\] (34f) Thus the MFT coupling parameter \[\lambda_{c}\] just shifts the entire inverse susceptibility versus \[T\] curve vertically by an amount \[-\lambda_{c}/N\] , and therefore does not change the temperature of the maximum in \[\chi(T)\] at about 115 K in Fig. 14 .

Now we express \[\lambda_{c}\] in terms of an exchange constant \[J_{c}\] between a spin and a nearest-neighbor spin in an adjacent layer. The part of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian associated with the interaction of spin \[\mathbf{S}_{i}\] with the two nearest-neighbor spins \[\mathbf{S}_{j}\] in adjacent layers is \[\mathcal{H}_{i}=\frac{1}{2}J_{c}\mathbf{S}_{i}\cdot\sum_{j=1}^{2}\mathbf{S}_{ j}=\frac{J_{c}}{2g^{2}\mu_{\text{B}}^{2}}\vec{\mu}_{i}\cdot\sum_{j=1}^{2}\vec{\mu}_{j},\] (35) where the factor of \[1/2\] arises because the exchange energy is equally shared by each spin within a pair of interacting spins. The magnetic moment \[\vec{\mu}\] and spin \[\mathbf{S}\] vectors are related by \[\vec{\mu}=-g\mathbf{S}\mu_{\text{B}}\] , where the minus sign arises from the negative sign of the charge on the electron. In MFT, one writes the time- and space-average of the energy per spin \[E_{i}\] in the PM state as \[E_{i}=\frac{J_{c}}{g^{2}\mu_{\text{B}}^{2}}\mu_{i}\mu_{j}\equiv-\frac{1}{2} \mu_{i}H_{\text{exch}\,c\,i},\] (36) where the factor of \[1/2\] on the right-hand side arises because when calculating the exchange field, all of the interaction energy \[E_{i}\] between moments \[\vec{\mu}_{i}\] and \[\vec{\mu}_{j}\] is assigned to the neighbor \[\vec{\mu}_{j}\] of \[\vec{\mu}_{i}\] . Then, recognizing that the average moments satisfy \[\mu_{i}=\mu_{j}\] in the PM state, the exchange field associated with the \[c\] -axis interactions is found from Eq. ( 36 ) to be \[H_{\text{exch}\,c\,i}=-\frac{2J_{c}}{g^{2}\mu_{\text{B}}^{2}}\mu_{i}.\] (37) Comparing Eqs. ( 37 ) and ( 34b ) gives \[\lambda_{c}=\frac{2J_{c}}{g^{2}\mu_{\text{B}}^{2}}.\] (38) Substituting Eq. ( 38 ) into ( 34e ) gives \[\chi^{\text{spin}}(T)=\frac{\chi_{\text{Padc}}(T)}{1+\frac{2J_{\text{Padc}}(T )}{Ng^{2}\mu_{\text{B}}^{2}}}.\] (39) From Eq. ( 39 ), an AFM (positive) J_{c} suppresses the susceptibility, whereas a FM (negative) J_{c} enhances it, as expected. Our inelastic neutron scattering results indicated an AFM Co-Co interlayer interaction in SrCo_{2}As_{2}.[23] Therefore the anomalously negative value of \chi_{0} derived in the previous section that suppresses \chi probably arises at least in part from the presence of the c-axis AFM Co-Co interactions that are neglected in the J_{1}-J_{2} model. Using Eq. (39 ), in order to produce the same effect on \chi(T) at its maximum as \chi_{0}=-5.8\times 10^{-4} cm^{3}/mol (Fig. 14 ) would require J_{c}/k_{\text{B}}=460 K, which according to our inelastic neutron scattering data (Ref. [23]) is much too large compared to |J_{1}|, J_{2}=138 K and should therefore be considered an upper limit. We conclude that within the present model, a significant diamagnetic \chi_{0} value as well as a significant AFM c-axis coupling are present.

Finally, we add a caveat that our analyses of the magnetic properties of AFM CaCo_{2}As_{2} indicate that the magnetism is itinerant,[27] whereas the above analyses of \chi(T) for SrCo_{2}As_{2} were carried out within a local-moment picture.

The principle axis of the EFG at the As site in tetragonal SrCo_{2}As_{2} is found to be along the crystal c axis as for members of the AFe_{2}As_{2} family that have tetragonal symmetry,[76, 77, 78, 79, 80] since in our CoAs-based compound and in the tetragonal FeAs-based materials the As site has a local fourfold rotational symmetry about the c axis. The spectra for SrCo_{2}As_{2} for both H directions did not show any obvious magnetic broadenings at any temperature between 1.6 and 275 K, which indicates that static magnetic ordering does not occur in this compound above 1.6 K.

The inset of Fig. 15 shows the temperature dependence of the nuclear quadrupole frequency v_{\rm Q}=e\,QV_{ZZ}/2h, where Q is the electric quadrupole moment of the ^{75}As nucleus, V_{ZZ} is the principal-axis EFG at the As site and h is Planck's constant. V_{ZZ} arises from hybridization between the As-4 p and Co-3d orbitals with an additional contribution from the noncubic part of the spatial distribution of surrounding ions. The v_{\rm Q} decreases by about 15% on cooling, from 10 MHz at 250 K to 8.45 MHz at 1.6 K. A decrease of v_{\rm Q} by \sim 15% on lowering T from 280 to 140 K was also observed in BaFe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [76]) where v_{\rm Q} is much smaller in BaFe_{2}As_{2} than in SrCo_{2}As_{2}. These behaviors sharply contrast with that observed for SrFe_{2}As_{2} where v_{\rm Q}_increases_ from 2.0 MHz at 300 K to 2.6 MHz at \sim 210 K.[76]

Figure 16(a) shows the T dependences of the NMR shifts K_{ab} and K_{c} for H parallel to the ab plane and parallel to the c axis, respectively, where the second-order quadrupole shift was corrected for in K_{ab}(T). As T decreases below room temperature, both K_{ab} and K_{c} increase and show broad maxima at the about the same temperature of \approx 115 K, similar to the \chi(T) behavior in Fig. 11, and then decrease monotonically at lower T without showing upturns. The small upturns in \chi(T) observed at low T in Fig. 11 are therefore not intrinsic and evidently arise from a small amount of a PM impurity that is not saturable in fields up to 5.5 T (see Fig. 10).

Figure 16(b) shows K_{ab} and K_{c} from Fig. 16(a) versus \chi_{ab} and \chi_{c} from Fig. 11, respectively, with T as an implicit parameter, for T\

 below 38 K in the inset of Fig. 4 above is another indication of Fermi liquid behavior.

Next, we discuss the relationship between the anisotropy of our 1/T_{1} data and the anisotropy of the Co spin fluctuations. Here we follow the same procedure previously performed on Fe pnictides. [76, 81, 82] In general, 1/T_{1} can be described in terms of the fluctuating hyperfine field perpendicular to the applied magnetic field at the NMR angular frequency \omega_{\rm N} according to

\[\left(\frac{1}{T_{1}}\right)_{z} = \frac{\gamma_{\rm N}^{2}}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}[(H_{{\rm hf}, x}(t),H_{{\rm hf},x}(0))\] (40) \[+(H_{{\rm hf},y}(t),H_{{\rm hf},y}(0))]\exp(i\omega_{\rm N}t)\,dt\] \[= \gamma_{\rm N}^{2}\sum_{\bf q}[|H_{{\rm hf},x}({\bf q},\omega_{\rm N })|^{2}+|H_{{\rm hf},y}({\bf q},\omega_{\rm N})|^{2}],\]

where the z direction corresponds to the external field direction and |X({\bf q},\omega_{\rm N})|^{2} denotes the {\bf q}-dependent power spectral density at \omega_{\rm N} of a time-dependent random variable X(t).

Defining the hyperfine coupling tensor as \tilde{A}, the hyperfine fields at the As site can be described as the sum of contributions from the four nearest-neighbor Co spins as [77, 82]

\[{\bf H}_{\rm hf}({\bf q},\omega_{\rm N})=\sum_{i=1}^{4}\tilde{A}_{i}\mathcal{S }_{i}({\bf q},\omega_{\rm N})=\tilde{A}\mathcal{S}_{i}({\bf q},\omega_{\rm N}),\] (41)

where

\[\tilde{A}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}A_{a}&D&B_{1}\\ D&A_{b}&B_{2}\\ B_{1}&B_{2}&A_{c}\end{array}\right).\] (42)

Here, \tilde{A} is described in orthorhombic axis (stacked Co square-lattice) notation for consistency with the previous discussion on Fe pnictides. [77] We consider the cases where A_{a} (\alpha=a,\,b,\,c), B_{i} (i=1,2) and D in \tilde{A} are, respectively, the diagonal components along the \alpha direction with {\bf q}=(0,0), the off-diagonal components related to stripe AFM correlations with {\bf q}=(\pi,0) or (0,\pi), and the off-diagonal components associated with Neel-type spin correlations with {\bf q}=(\pi,\pi). [81] Defining the amplitude of the spin fluctuation spectral density as \mathcal{S}_{a}\equiv\sqrt{|S_{a}({\bf q},\omega_{\rm N})|^{2}} (\alpha=a,\,b,\,c), using the above equations and writing A_{ab}\equiv A_{a}=A_{b} and \mathcal{S}_{ab}\equiv\mathcal{S}_{a}=\mathcal{S}_{b} appropriate to the tetragonal symmetry of SrCo_{2}As_{2}, the ratio

\[r\equiv\frac{T_{1,c}}{T_{1,ab}}\] (43)

is obtained as [82]

\[r=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}0.5+0.5\left(\frac{A_{c}\mathcal{S}_{a}}{\mathcal{ S}_{a}}\right)^{2}&{\rm for}\ {\bf q}=(0,0),\\ 0.5+\left(\frac{\mathcal{S}_{a}}{\mathcal{S}_{r}}\right)^{2}&{\rm for}\ { \bf q}=(\pi,0)\ {\rm or}\ (0,\pi),\\ 0.5&{\rm for}\ {\bf q}=(\pi,\pi).\end{array}\right.\] (44b)

As plotted in Fig. 17(c), r is almost constant versus T with a value r\approx 1. From our inelastic neutron scattering measurements, the dominant AFM fluctuations/correlations are stripe-type with {\bf q}=(\pi,0) or (0,\pi) in Co square-lattice notation. [23] According to Eq. (44b), the value r\approx 1 observed in Fig. 17(c) then arises from anisotropic spin fluctuations with \mathcal{S}_{ab}\approx 0.71\,\mathcal{S}_{c}. This means that stripe-type AFM Co spin fluctuations along the c-axis are stronger than in the ab plane. An anisotropy in spin fluctuations is also observed in various Fe-based superconductors in the paramagnetic state near T_{\rm N}, but \mathcal{S}_{ab} is always larger than \mathcal{S}_{c}, [76, 63] in contrast to our result for SrCo_{2}As_{2}. Neel-type AFM spin fluctuations with {\bf q}=(\pi,\pi) can be ruled out because according to Eq. (44c), that would require r=0.5 in conflict with our measurements in Fig. 17(c) that give r\approx 1.

Our 1/T_{1} data can also be analyzed with Eq. (44a) solely in terms of FM spin fluctuations with {\bf q}=(0,0). Using the ratio of the hyperfine fields A_{c}/A_{ab}=45.0/65.9=0.653 determined from the K-\chi plot in Fig. 16(b), r\approx 1 can be reproduced with anisotropic spin fluctuations with \mathcal{S}_{ab}=0.65\,\mathcal{S}_{c}. Interestingly, this analysis also gives the same nature of the anisotropy of the spin fluctuations as discussed above for stripe-type AFM fluctuations. Therefore one cannot uniquely determine the nature of the spin fluctuations utilizing NMR data alone. The {\bf q}-dependent static susceptibility \chi({\bf q}) obtained from electronic structure calculations showed a peak at {\bf q}=(0,0) as well as at {\bf q}=(\pi,0) and (0,\pi), [23] so spin fluctuations may well occur with peaks at both the FM and stripe-type AFM wave vectors.

From our NMR data on SrCo_{2}As_{2} crystals we conclude that the conduction carriers form a Fermi liquid that exhibits significant FM and/or AFM spin fluctuations. The presence of strong AFM spin fluctuations at low temperatures has been specifically demonstrated from our inelastic neutron scattering measurements of single crystals, [23] and FM correlations from the strongly enhanced \chi discussed above in Sec. VIII.1.

## X Single-crystal neutron diffraction

The above thermal expansion, \rho(T), C_{\rm p}(T), \chi(T), and NMR measurements showed no evidence for any phase transitions from 1.3 to 300 K in SrCo_{2}As_{2}. This result is consistent with the neutron scattering measurements on SrCo_{2}As_{2} crystals [23] that showed no evidence for long-range AFM order at the propagation vector of the stripe-type AFM order found [3] in the 122-type iron arsenides. However, the

Figure 17: (Color online) (a) Temperature dependence of 1/T_{1} for SrCo_{2}As_{2} for both magnetic field directions, H\parallel c axis and H\parallel ab plane. The straight line shows the metallic Korringa dependence 1/T_{1}\propto T. (b) T dependence of T_{1}T\kappa^{2}. The symbol designations are the same as in (a). (c) T dependence of the ratio r=T_{1,c}/T_{1,ab}.

  inelastic neutron scattering measurements did show strong dynamic AFM correlations in SrCo_{2}As_{2} at this propagation vector.[23] On the other hand, neutron diffraction measurements on CaCo_{2}As_{2} confirmed the presence of A-type long-range AFM order characterized by magnetic Bragg peaks at reciprocal lattice points (h 0 \ell) with h+\ell=2n+1 [e.g., (2 0 1) and (2 0 3)] with an upper limit of 0.6 \mu_{\text{B}}/Co for the ordered moment.[27]

To complement the above null result for the occurrence of long-range stripe-type AFM ordering in SrCo_{2}As_{2}, here we searched for evidence of A-type[27] or G-type[41] long-range AFM order in a SrCo_{2}As_{2} crystal using single-crystal neutron diffraction at the base temperature of T\approx 3 K and did not find any such evidence. Figure 18 shows scans through both nuclear [Figs. 18(a) and 18(b)] and A-type AFM [Figs. 18(c) and 18(d)] Bragg peak positions. There is no evidence of scattering above background at the latter positions. Note the factor of \sim15,000 finer scale of the ordinates for the potential AFM peak positions in Figs. 18(c) and 18(d) compared to those of the nuclear reflections in Figs. 18(a) and 18(b). The small increase in scattering with decreasing angle in Fig. 18(c) is likely due to some degree of preferred orientation in the Al sample can since the scattering angle is close to that for the Al (2 0 0) powder line. Measurements to check for G-type long-range AFM order are complicated by the fact that the AFM Bragg reflections are coincident with nuclear Bragg peaks. However, we found no evidence of enhanced scattering at the (1 0 1) position of the strongest G-type AFM reflection (not shown).

## XI Ground state of SrCo_{2}As_{2}

Our x-ray and neutron diffraction, \rho(T), M(H,T), \chi(T), C_{\text{p}}(T), and NMR measurements reveal no evidence for any phase transitions in SrCo_{2}As_{2} from 300 K down to 1.3 K. On the other hand, the temperature T_{\text{max}}\approx 115 K at which the broad maximum in \chi(T) occurs, the Weiss temperature \theta_{\text{p}}\sim-150 K in the Curie-Weiss law fits from 200 to 300 K in Table 3, the large values of |J_{1}|=J_{2}=138 K in Fig. 14 obtained by fitting the \chi(T) data by the J_{1}-J_{2} model, and the observation of strong stripe-type AFM spin correlations in neutron scattering measurements[23] demonstrate that AFM spin correlations are present and are strong. However, long-range AFM order is not observed above 1.3 K. A measure of the ratio of the energy scale of the AFM spin correlations to the long-range AFM transition temperature T_{\text{N}}<1.3 K is therefore

\[f=\frac{|\theta_{\text{p}}|}{T_{\text{N}}}\gtrsim 100.\] (45)

In insulating local-moment systems, f is called the frustration parameter.[84] In such systems in which frustration prevents long-range AFM ordering, a ratio f\gtrsim 100 and the absence of static magnetic ordering of any kind occurring in the accessible temperature range point towards a quantum spin-liquid (QSL) ground state in which quantum fluctuations prevent static long-range magnetic ordering from occurring. Thus to establish a probable quantum spin-liquid ground state,[85] one needs to demonstrate (1) the presence of spin interactions and have a measure of its strength such as \theta_{\text{p}}, which establishes the presence of a spin liquid instead of a spin gas, (2) that static magnetic ordering does not occur in the accessible temperature range, (3) that a relation such as Eq. (45) is satisfied, and (4) that the lattice symmetry is not broken by the putative QSL ground state. An extensively studied example of an insulator containing Cu^{+2} spins-1/2 that satisfies these conditions is ZnCu_{3}(OH)_{6}Cl_{2} (or with deuterium replacing H), which is called herbertsmithite.[86, 87, 88, 89, 90]

The concept of a QSL ground state has been applied in the past to insulating spin S=1/2 local-moment systems.[85] However, some itinerant spin systems such as the iron pnictides and chalcogenides and related materials are moderately correlated electron systems and sometimes have both itinerant and local-moment characteristics.[3, 91, 92, 93, 94] In such cases, we suggest that one may be able to apply the same four criteria above with respect to a possible QSL ground state. In particular, since we have demonstrated that the above four conditions are satisfied for metallic SrCo_{2}As_{2}, we suggest that this compound has a quantum spin-liquid ground state. An alternative and very rare ground state for metallic strongly-correlated frustrated d-electron systems is a heavy-fermion ground state as observed in the cubic spinel-structure metallic compound LiV_{2}O_{4}.[95, 96, 97] This compound shows local-moment Curie-Weiss behavior at high T and crosses over to the heavy-fermion ground state below about 10 K.

## XII Summary and conclusions

A comprehensive study of the crystallographic, electronic, magnetic, and thermal properties of SrCo_{2}As_{2} single crystals

Figure 18: (Color online) Single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements at T=3 K searching for A-type AFM order in SrCo_{2}As_{2}. The (0 0 8) and (2 0 0) nuclear Bragg peaks are shown in panels (a) and (b), respectively. The neutron intensity measured as the sample is rocked through the (2 0 1) and (2 0 3) positions at which magnetic Bragg peaks would be observed for A-type AFM ordering is shown in panels (c) and (d), respectively. The calculated values of \theta_{\text{sample}} of this potential type of AFM ordering are 40.4^{\circ} in (c) and 62.2^{\circ} in (d), respectively, which are near the middle of the respective scans.

  is reported. The room-temperature crystal structure was confirmed to be the body-centered tetragonal ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type (I4/mmm) structure with an As-As interlayer distance intermediate between the uncollapsed- and collapsed-tetragonal values in BaCo_{2}As_{2} and CaCo_{2}As_{2}, respectively. No phase transitions of any kind were detected between 1.3 and 300 K in any of our measurements, in spite of the strong negative thermal expansion of the c axis from 7.4 to 300 K and the negative volume expansion from 7.4 to \approx 80 K. The a-axis thermal expansion is normal (positive) from 7.4 to 300 K. Furthermore, we determined from neutron diffraction measurements on a single crystal that long-range AFM order is not present at 3 K for either A-type or G-type ordering, which complements our previous determination that such ordering also does not occur at the propagation vector for stripe-type AFM ordering.[23]

The \rho(T) and ARPES measurements and the LDA band structure calculations consistently demonstrate that SrCo_{2}As_{2} is metallic with electron Fermi surfaces centered at \Gamma (0,0) and on the edges of the first Brillouin zone (BZ) at \mathbf{k}=(\pm\pi,0) and \mathbf{k}=(0,\,\pm\pi). An anomalous flat band with d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} character is also present in the second BZ that extends over a large fraction of the zone and results in a sharp and high peak in the electronic density of states \mathcal{D}(E\approx E_{\mathrm{F}}). This feature may be responsible for some of the anomalous properties we observe such as the negative thermal expansion and perhaps some of the T-dependent magnetic properties. The C_{\mathrm{p}}(T) and \frac{1}{T_{1}}(T) NMR data also exhibit metallic Fermi liquid character via the presence of a Sommerfeld electronic contribution \gamma\,T and a Korringa contribution, respectively. A comparison of the measured and band structure values of \gamma indicates a value of the combined many-body electron-phonon and electron-electron density of states enhancements of \approx 45%.

The \chi(T) data show a Curie-Weiss-like T dependence above 200 K with a large negative (AFM) Weiss temperature \theta_{\mathrm{p}}\sim-150 K indicative of dominant AFM correlations in the system, consistent with our inelastic neutron scattering measurements that demonstrated the presence of strong stripe-type AFM fluctuations[23] that occur at the same wave vector as in the AFe_{2}As_{2} high-T_{\mathrm{c}} parent compounds.[3, 10] However, our ARPES measurements and band structure calculations for SrCo_{2}As_{2} show no obvious Fermi surface nesting occurring at this wave vector, in contrast to the clear nesting at this wave vector in the semimetallic AFe_{2}As_{2} compounds.[3] The anisotropy of I/T_{1} determined from our NMR measurements is consistent with either stripe-type AFM spin correlations or FM spin correlations or a combination of these. At low temperatures, the \chi(T) data for the two field directions show an upturn, but our NMR Knight shift measurements of the spin susceptibility show that these upturns are not intrinsic.

We modeled our \chi(T) data at high T by a Curie-Weiss law and obtained values for the Curie constant and for the Weiss temperature \theta_{\mathrm{p}}\sim-150 K, which is strongly antiferromagnetic. We also modeled the data, including the broad maximum at \approx 115 K, using a local-moment interconfigurational fluctuation model between a ground state level with spin S=0 and an excited triplet state with S=1, and obtained good fits to the powder-averaged \chi(T) data. We further modeled the data in terms of the J_{1}-J_{2} frustrated local-moment spin-1/2 square lattice Heisenberg model. For the latter model, a good fit to the \chi_{ab}(T) data was obtained for a FM (negative) J_{1}, AFM J_{2} and J_{2}/J_{1}=-1, as suggested by the inelastic neutron scattering results,[23] with |J_{1}|/K_{\mathrm{B}}=J_{2}/K_{\mathrm{B}}=138 K.

The \chi for SrCo_{2}As_{2} has a large magnitude, roughly a factor of 3-5 larger than those of the AFe_{2}As_{2} compounds in the paramagnetic state.[3] Within an itinerant magnetism picture, this suggests an even larger Stoner enhancement than in the FeAs-based compounds.[3] Moreover, the Wilson ratio for SrCo_{2}As_{2} is \approx 3.5 and the Stoner criterion indicates that this compound should be an itinerant ferromagnet. A similar situation occurs in BaCo_{2}As_{2}, where it was suggested that strong quantum fluctuations occur due to proximity to a quantum critical point that suppress long-range FM order.[24]

Thus, in SrCo_{2}As_{2}, both FM and stripe-type AFM fluctuations/correlations appear to coexist, as also indicated by static \chi(\mathbf{q}) calculations that show peaks at both wave vectors.[23] This competition, the formal intermediate valence of the Co ions and the resultant quantum fluctuations may suppress the occurrence of any type of static long-range magnetic order in this compound. As discussed in Sec. XI, we suggest that metallic SrCo_{2}As_{2} has a gapless quantum spin-liquid (QSL) ground state. It will be very interesting to study in detail the spin excitation spectrum of this compound and compare it with those of insulating local-moment systems that are the traditional candidates for QSL ground states.

The FeAs-based and cuprate high-T_{\mathrm{c}} superconductors have a common phenomenology in which long-range AFM order of the parent compounds must be largely suppressed before superconductivity appears, but where strong AFM fluctuations must still be present to act as the superconducting glue. Even though we have demonstrated that these two conditions are met in undoped SrCo_{2}As_{2}, this compound is not superconducting above 1.8 K. Key open questions are therefore why superconductivity does not occur in SrCo_{2}As_{2}, what the role of the FM correlations is, and whether chemical substitutions of some type or applied pressure can induce superconductivity, perhaps even at high temperatures.

* [63] The values of \chi(1.8 K) quoted for a BaCo_{2}As_{2} crystal in the text of Ref. [24] and plotted in Fig. 1 of Ref. [24] were \chi_{c}=5.4\times 10^{-3} and \chi_{ab}=3.8\times 10^{-3}cm^{3}/mol, which are 65% and 40% larger than the values that we obtained from the high-field slopes of the M(H) data at 1.8 K in the inset of their Fig. 1, respectively, as quoted in our Eq. (13). These errors in the quoted values of \chi_{c} and \chi_{ab} in Ref. [24] are due to the presence of a small amount of ferromagnetic impurity in the crystal that was not accounted for, combined with the small field H=0.1 T that was used to obtain the \chi\equiv M/H data in their Fig. 1. Furthermore, the anisotropy obtained from their high-field measurements may be reversed compared that shown in their Fig. 1 obtained at H=0.1 T and in the inset to their Fig. 1 (A. S. Sefat, private communication). In very recent measurements on single crystals [V. K. Anand, _et al._ (unpublished)], our group finds that the \chi anisotropy of BaCo_{2}As_{2} is reversed from that in Fig. 1 of Ref. [24] and from that in our Eqs. (13) derived from their data. For a discussion of the effects of ferromagnetic impurities on the measured M and \chi\equiv M/H values of materials see Sec. 3.5.2 of Ref. [3]. We thank A. S. Sefat for sending us a listing of the M(H) data in the inset of Fig. 1 of Ref. [24].
