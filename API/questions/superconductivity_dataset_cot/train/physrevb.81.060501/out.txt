###### Abstract

We report on the determination of the electronic heat capacity of a slightly overdoped (_x_ = 0.075) Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} single crystal with a T_{c} of 21.4 K. Our analysis of the temperature dependence of the superconducting-state specific heat provides strong evidence for a two-band _s_-wave order parameter with gap amplitudes 2A_{1}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=1.9 and 2A_{2}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=4.4.

The recently discovered iron arsenide family (FeAs) offers new possibilities for studying the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism.[1, 2, 3] As for many other materials, e.g., heavy fermions and cuprates, superconductivity emerges in the vicinity of a magnetic instability. The origin of the pairing interaction, as well as the gap symmetry, remains unidentified in the pnictides. Theoretically, the particular topology of the Fermi surface with strong nesting features favor a multiband order parameter having either an _s_{\star\star}_-wave or a _d_-wave symmetry.[4, 5, 6, 7] In either case, a \pi-shift of the order-parameter phase is expected between different sheets of the Fermi surface. The identification of the gap symmetry is crucial, because it will shed light on the mechanism responsible for the condensation of Cooper pairs. Experimentally, solid evidence for a particular pairing state remains elusive, because several experimental probes point to different conclusions. For instance, in the electron-doped 122 compound, Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2}, photoemission data (ARPES),[8] and point-contact spectroscopy[9] show two distinct nodeless gaps with large amplitudes, while penetration-depth measurements[10] exhibit a power-law behavior reflecting the possible existence of nodes. Similar discrepancies are observed for hole-doped (Ba_{1-x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} and the 1111 series.[11, 12] Some of these apparent contradictions may arise from the influence of the magnetic instability, which is expected to strongly alter the gap topology,[13] from impurity effects, or from experimental difficulties like sample inhomogeneities or surface off-stoichiometry. Specific-heat measurements can provide an important measure of the bulk superconducting properties; specifically, they can give valuable information about the possible existence of nodes in the energy gap and, as previously shown for MgB_{2},[14, 15] to the number of bands that contribute to the superconducting condensate. Several specific-heat measurements have been reported for the Fe pnictides, but the interpretation of the results has been impaired by substantial contributions from paramagnetic centers and/or an incorrect evaluation of the large phonon background.[11, 16, 17, 18]

In this Rapid Communication, we present a detailed analysis of the electronic specific heat of a slightly overdoped Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} single crystal with x = 0.075, i.e., at a doping level where the static spin-density wave (SDW) is no longer observed. The problem of the phonon background determination is overcome by measuring a strongly overdoped crystal with x = 0.153, in which superconductivity is suppressed. Our analysis for the superconducting sample (_x_ = 0.075) gives strong evidence for two energy gaps, which implies that several sheets of the Fermi surface contribute to the formation of Cooper pairs. Additionally, we provide reliable values of the normal-state Sommerfeld coefficients \gamma_{\mu}=C_{c}/T for several Co concentrations.

Co-doped Ba122 single crystals were grown from self-flux in glassy carbon crucibles. Prereacted FeAs and CoAs powders were mixed with Ba, placed into the crucible, which then was sealed in an evacuated SiO_{2} ampoule. After heating to 650 degC and then to \approx1200 degC with holding times of 5 h, crystal growth took place during cooling at a rate of = 1 degC/h. At 1000 degC, the ampoule was tilted to decant the remaining liquid flux from the crystals and subsequently removed from the furnace. The composition of these samples was determined by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy to be x = 0.075(+-0.005-0.01) and x = 0.153(+-0.005-0.01), respectively. The specific heat was measured with the ^{3}He operation in a PPMS from Quantum Design.

Figure 1 shows the specific heat of both samples. No traces of a long-range SDW were detected for either sample in the entire temperature range, in agreement with previous

  reports.[18, 19, 20] For x = 0.075, a small anomaly at 21.4 K indicates the onset of bulk superconductivity. The second sample, with x = 0.153, remains in the normal state down to 0.5 K, but its heat capacity exhibits an upturn below 2 K. Further measurements in magnetic fields have shown that this upturn is related to a Schottky-like contribution, probably due to paramagnetic centers which increase in number as the sample deteriorates in air. The specific heat of both samples is dominated by the lattice contribution; the electronic part is only about =15% of the total signal at _T__{c}, for x = 0.075. Therefore, it is impossible to obtain an unequivocal lattice background by fitting the specific heat of the superconducting sample to an odd-power polynomial above _T__{c}. Instead, a more reliable phonon term can be inferred from the data of the x = 0.153 sample, whose low-temperature specific heat follows precisely the Debye law between 2 and 6 K, with \gamma_{n} = 15.8 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and _B__{3}=0.404 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-4} (full line, inset of Fig. 1). Thus, an accurate lattice contribution _C__{lat} is derived by combining the experimental data above 2 K with the fit extrapolation for _T_< 2 K (dashed line in Fig. 1), after subtraction of the electronic term.

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the electron specific heat _C__{e} (_x_ = 0.075) = _C_(_x_ = 0.075) - _f__{s}_C__{lat}(_x_ = 0.153), with a scaling factor _f__{s} of 1.01. The magnitude of _f__{s} is determined by enforcing entropy conservation, i.e., \int_{0}^{T}\gamma_{s}dT = \int_{0}^{T}C_{e}/TdT (inset of Fig. 2). The small deviation of _f__{s} from unity, plausibly related to experimental uncertainites, demonstrates that the above procedure represents a very good method to determine the phonon background. Physically, this indicates that the substitution of Fe by Co does not substantially affect the lattice properties, as shown by recent inelastic x-ray scattering measurements and _ab initio_ calculations.[21]

The superconducting transition at _T__{c}=21.4 K is remarkably sharp, indicating little inhomogeneity in the crystal. The normal-state electron contribution for x = 0.075 is \gamma_{n} = 24 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}, which is in excellent agreement with LDA+DMFT calculations, which require \gamma_{n} to be enhanced to 20-30 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} in order to explain mass renormalization by Hund coupling.[23] Our values for several Co concentrations, summarized in Table 1, show that the disappearance of the SDW with Co doping is accompanied by an increase of the electronic density of states (EDOS), compatible with a progressive closure of the SDW gap. In the overdoped region, on the other hand, \gamma_{n} and _T__{c} both decrease. Interestingly, \gamma_{n} of our superconducting sample is only about half as large as the value reported for K-doped 122 single crystals[11] (=63 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}).

Figure 2 illustrates that _C__{e}/_T_ does not extrapolate to zero at _T_=0 but to a residual normal-state-like contribution \gamma_{n}=5.8 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}. Taken at face value, this would indicate that the sample has a superconducting fraction of _C__{es}. Finite values of \gamma_{r} are a generic feature of specific-heat measurements of electron-doped 122 iron arsenides.[11, 24] For the cuprates,[25, 26] they have been attributed to an incomplete transition to the superconducting-state and volume fractions of normal and superconducting material \gamma_{r}/\gamma_{n} and 1 - \gamma_{r}/\gamma_{n}, respectively. On this basis, the specific heat is the sum of separate contributions of the superconducting and normal phases and consequently, the electronic specific heat can be normalized to one mole of superconducting material, defined by:

\[C_{es}=(C_{e}-\gamma_{r}T)\frac{\gamma_{n}}{\gamma_{n}-\gamma_{r}}.\] (1)

However, recent specific-heat[24] and heat-transport[27] measurements suggest that \gamma_{r}T is a consequence of pair breaking in electron-doped 122 pnictides, and not due to the presence of normal material. In that case, the specific heat is, in principle, not the sum of contributions of broken pairs and the superconducting condensate. Nevertheless, in analogy with the Na cobaltates,[28]C_{es} (given by Eq. (1)) can be expected to be a reasonable and useful approximation to the specific heat of one mole of superconducting material, and is used, in Fig. 3, for the purpose of comparison with several possible order parameters. Figure 3(a) demonstrates that _C__{ex} cannot be described by the specific heat of a single-band BCS _s_-wave superconductor, calculated in the weak-coupling limit (blue line). The agreement is very poor. As for MgB_{2},[14] the positive curvature of _C__{es} for _T_/_T__{c}> 0.6, where the BCS curve shows negative curvature, is indicative of strong-coupling effects, but the observed discontinuity at _T__{c}, \Delta C_{es}/\gamma_{n}T_{c}, which would be greater than the BCS value for a strong

  coupled single-band superconductor, is close to weak-coupling value. In addition, C_{ss} is significantly larger than the BCS curve, for T/T_{c}\!<\!0.4, again arguing against strong-coupling effects. Figure 3(a) also shows the specific heat of a single-band d-wave superconductor in the weak-coupling limit (green line).[41] It is obvious that such a k-dependent gap, even in a strong coupling or a two-band scenario, cannot describe the observed low-temperature exponential behavior that can be inferred from the data.

We therefore focus our discussion on the possibility of two energy gaps, using the phenomenological two-band \alpha-model, introduced by Bouquet _et al._[15, 29] It allows a fit of the specific heat from low temperatures up to T_{c} and, as a result, gives reliable gap amplitudes that were shown to agree quantitatively with band calculations on MgB_{2} in particular,[15, 30] and with Eliashberg equations in general.[31] In this fit, the specific heat is taken as the sum of contributions from two bands, which are calculated independently assuming a BCS temperature dependence of the superconducting gaps. Two gap magnitudes, at T\!=\!0, are introduced as adjustable parameters, \alpha_{1}\!\!=\!\!\Delta_{1}(0)/k_{B}T_{c} and \alpha_{2}\!\!=\!\!\Delta_{2}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}, together with a third quantity, \gamma_{l}/\gamma_{h}(i\!=\!1,2), which measures the fraction of the total normal EDOS that the i-th band contributes to the superconducting condensate.[42] As shown in Fig. 3(b), the two-band fit (with \alpha_{1}\!\!=\!\!0.95, \alpha_{2}\!\!=\!\!2.2, and \gamma_{1}/\gamma_{n}\!\!=\!\!0.33) accurately reproduces the specific heat over the entire temperature range. These gap values conform to the theoretical constraints that one gap must be larger than the BCS gap and one smaller in a weakly coupled two-band superconductor.[32] Moreover, they are comparable with those derived from recent NMR (Ref. [33]) and \muSR-penetration-depth measurements[34] (see Table 2), but differ appreciably, by at least a factor 1.5, from ARPES data.[8]

Ba(Fe_{0.925}Co_{0.075})_{2}As_{2} also shares similar properties with NbSe_{2}, another candidate for multiband superconductivity, as illustrated by thermodynamic measurements[35, 36] and ARPES spectra.[37] The specific heat of both NbSe_{2} and Ba(Fe_{0.925}Co_{0.075})_{2}As_{2} show no sign of an incipient steep increase of C(T) below T_{c}, which is the conspicuous signature of the small gap in MgB_{2}.[14] This increase is particularly pronounced in MgB_{2} because (i) \Delta_{2}/\Delta_{1} is about twice as large as in Ba(Fe_{0.925}Co_{0.075})_{2}As_{2} and NbSe_{2}, (ii) each gap gives an equal contribution, \gamma_{2}/\gamma_{1}\!\!\approx\!1, to the specific heat of MgB_{2}. In contrast, in both NbSe_{2} and Ba(Fe_{0.925}Co_{0.075})_{2}As_{2} the major-gap contributions strongly dominate, with \gamma_{2}/\gamma_{1} roughly equal to 4 and 2.3, respectively.

We now discuss to what extent our results are consistent with the predicted s_{\pm}- order parameter.[4, 5, 6, 7] In Ba(Fe_{0.925}Co_{0.075})_{2}As_{2}, the major gap develops around the Fermi-surface sheet that shows the largest EDOS, while it is theoretically expected that \Delta_{1}/\Delta_{2}\!\propto\!\!\sqrt{N_{2}/N_{1}}, in the limit of pure interband pairing.[38] Our result is not incompatible with the s_{\pm}-state, and could indicate that either intraband interactions are significant (as pointed out in Ref. [38]), or that more than two bands are involved in the pairing mechanism.[39] The large residual EDOS observed in the superconducting state, in the present data, actually favors the s_{\pm}-state, since non-magnetic scattering centers (e.g., Co dopant) are expected to be pair breaking for this particular state in the Born limit.[6, 40]

In summary, a detailed analysis of the electronic specific heat of Ba(Fe_{0.925}Co_{0.075})_{2}As_{2} provides strong evidence of a multigap order parameter. Our data are fit very well by a two-band s-wave model. Further, we derive a reliable phonon contribution that permits to extract accurate values of the normal-state Sommerfeld coefficient.

###### Abstract

We report on the determination of the electronic heat capacity of a slightly overdoped (_x_ = 0.075) Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} single crystal with a T_{c} of 21.4 K. Our analysis of the temperature dependence of the superconducting-state specific heat provides strong evidence for a two-band _s_-wave order parameter with gap amplitudes 2A_{1}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=1.9 and 2A_{2}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=4.4.

The recently discovered iron arsenide family (FeAs) offers new possibilities for studying the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism.[1, 2, 3] As for many other materials, e.g., heavy fermions and cuprates, superconductivity emerges in the vicinity of a magnetic instability. The origin of the pairing interaction, as well as the gap symmetry, remains unidentified in the pnictides. Theoretically, the particular topology of the Fermi surface with strong nesting features favor a multiband order parameter having either an _s_{\star\star}_-wave or a _d_-wave symmetry.[4, 5, 6, 7] In either case, a \pi-shift of the order-parameter phase is expected between different sheets of the Fermi surface. The identification of the gap symmetry is crucial, because it will shed light on the mechanism responsible for the condensation of Cooper pairs. Experimentally, solid evidence for a particular pairing state remains elusive, because several experimental probes point to different conclusions. For instance, in the electron-doped 122 compound, Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2}, photoemission data (ARPES),[8] and point-contact spectroscopy[9] show two distinct nodeless gaps with large amplitudes, while penetration-depth measurements[10] exhibit a power-law behavior reflecting the possible existence of nodes. Similar discrepancies are observed for hole-doped (Ba_{1-x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} and the 1111 series.[11, 12] Some of these apparent contradictions may arise from the influence of the magnetic instability, which is expected to strongly alter the gap topology,[13] from impurity effects, or from experimental difficulties like sample inhomogeneities or surface off-stoichiometry. Specific-heat measurements can provide an important measure of the bulk superconducting properties; specifically, they can give valuable information about the possible existence of nodes in the energy gap and, as previously shown for MgB_{2},[14, 15] to the number of bands that contribute to the superconducting condensate. Several specific-heat measurements have been reported for the Fe pnictides, but the interpretation of the results has been impaired by substantial contributions from paramagnetic centers and/or an incorrect evaluation of the large phonon background.[11, 16, 17, 18]

In this Rapid Communication, we present a detailed analysis of the electronic specific heat of a slightly overdoped Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} single crystal with x = 0.075, i.e., at a doping level where the static spin-density wave (SDW) is no longer observed. The problem of the phonon background determination is overcome by measuring a strongly overdoped crystal with x = 0.153, in which superconductivity is suppressed. Our analysis for the superconducting sample (_x_ = 0.075) gives strong evidence for two energy gaps, which implies that several sheets of the Fermi surface contribute to the formation of Cooper pairs. Additionally, we provide reliable values of the normal-state Sommerfeld coefficients \gamma_{\mu}=C_{c}/T for several Co concentrations.

Co-doped Ba122 single crystals were grown from self-flux in glassy carbon crucibles. Prereacted FeAs and CoAs powders were mixed with Ba, placed into the crucible, which then was sealed in an evacuated SiO_{2} ampoule. After heating to 650 degC and then to \approx1200 degC with holding times of 5 h, crystal growth took place during cooling at a rate of = 1 degC/h. At 1000 degC, the ampoule was tilted to decant the remaining liquid flux from the crystals and subsequently removed from the furnace. The composition of these samples was determined by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy to be x = 0.075(+-0.005-0.01) and x = 0.153(+-0.005-0.01), respectively. The specific heat was measured with the ^{3}He operation in a PPMS from Quantum Design.

Figure 1 shows the specific heat of both samples. No traces of a long-range SDW were detected for either sample in the entire temperature range, in agreement with previous

  reports.[18, 19, 20] For x = 0.075, a small anomaly at 21.4 K indicates the onset of bulk superconductivity. The second sample, with x = 0.153, remains in the normal state down to 0.5 K, but its heat capacity exhibits an upturn below 2 K. Further measurements in magnetic fields have shown that this upturn is related to a Schottky-like contribution, probably due to paramagnetic centers which increase in number as the sample deteriorates in air. The specific heat of both samples is dominated by the lattice contribution; the electronic part is only about =15% of the total signal at _T__{c}, for x = 0.075. Therefore, it is impossible to obtain an unequivocal lattice background by fitting the specific heat of the superconducting sample to an odd-power polynomial above _T__{c}. Instead, a more reliable phonon term can be inferred from the data of the x = 0.153 sample, whose low-temperature specific heat follows precisely the Debye law between 2 and 6 K, with \gamma_{n} = 15.8 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and _B__{3}=0.404 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-4} (full line, inset of Fig. 1). Thus, an accurate lattice contribution _C__{lat} is derived by combining the experimental data above 2 K with the fit extrapolation for _T_< 2 K (dashed line in Fig. 1), after subtraction of the electronic term.

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the electron specific heat _C__{e} (_x_ = 0.075) = _C_(_x_ = 0.075) - _f__{s}_C__{lat}(_x_ = 0.153), with a scaling factor _f__{s} of 1.01. The magnitude of _f__{s} is determined by enforcing entropy conservation, i.e., \int_{0}^{T}\gamma_{s}dT = \int_{0}^{T}C_{e}/TdT (inset of Fig. 2). The small deviation of _f__{s} from unity, plausibly related to experimental uncertainites, demonstrates that the above procedure represents a very good method to determine the phonon background. Physically, this indicates that the substitution of Fe by Co does not substantially affect the lattice properties, as shown by recent inelastic x-ray scattering measurements and _ab initio_ calculations.[21]

The superconducting transition at _T__{c}=21.4 K is remarkably sharp, indicating little inhomogeneity in the crystal. The normal-state electron contribution for x = 0.075 is \gamma_{n} = 24 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}, which is in excellent agreement with LDA+DMFT calculations, which require \gamma_{n} to be enhanced to 20-30 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} in order to explain mass renormalization by Hund coupling.[23] Our values for several Co concentrations, summarized in Table 1, show that the disappearance of the SDW with Co doping is accompanied by an increase of the electronic density of states (EDOS), compatible with a progressive closure of the SDW gap. In the overdoped region, on the other hand, \gamma_{n} and _T__{c} both decrease. Interestingly, \gamma_{n} of our superconducting sample is only about half as large as the value reported for K-doped 122 single crystals[11] (=63 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}).

Figure 2 illustrates that _C__{e}/_T_ does not extrapolate to zero at _T_=0 but to a residual normal-state-like contribution \gamma_{n}=5.8 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}. Taken at face value, this would indicate that the sample has a superconducting fraction of _C__{es}. Finite values of \gamma_{r} are a generic feature of specific-heat measurements of electron-doped 122 iron arsenides.[11, 24] For the cuprates,[25, 26] they have been attributed to an incomplete transition to the superconducting-state and volume fractions of normal and superconducting material \gamma_{r}/\gamma_{n} and 1 - \gamma_{r}/\gamma_{n}, respectively. On this basis, the specific heat is the sum of separate contributions of the superconducting and normal phases and consequently, the electronic specific heat can be normalized to one mole of superconducting material, defined by:

\[C_{es}=(C_{e}-\gamma_{r}T)\frac{\gamma_{n}}{\gamma_{n}-\gamma_{r}}.\] (1)

However, recent specific-heat[24] and heat-transport[27] measurements suggest that \gamma_{r}T is a consequence of pair breaking in electron-doped 122 pnictides, and not due to the presence of normal material. In that case, the specific heat is, in principle, not the sum of contributions of broken pairs and the superconducting condensate. Nevertheless, in analogy with the Na cobaltates,[28]C_{es} (given by Eq. (1)) can be expected to be a reasonable and useful approximation to the specific heat of one mole of superconducting material, and is used, in Fig. 3, for the purpose of comparison with several possible order parameters. Figure 3(a) demonstrates that _C__{ex} cannot be described by the specific heat of a single-band BCS _s_-wave superconductor, calculated in the weak-coupling limit (blue line). The agreement is very poor. As for MgB_{2},[14] the positive curvature of _C__{es} for _T_/_T__{c}> 0.6, where the BCS curve shows negative curvature, is indicative of strong-coupling effects, but the observed discontinuity at _T__{c}, \Delta C_{es}/\gamma_{n}T_{c}, which would be greater than the BCS value for a strong

  coupled single-band superconductor, is close to weak-coupling value. In addition, C_{ss} is significantly larger than the BCS curve, for T/T_{c}\!<\!0.4, again arguing against strong-coupling effects. Figure 3(a) also shows the specific heat of a single-band d-wave superconductor in the weak-coupling limit (green line).[41] It is obvious that such a k-dependent gap, even in a strong coupling or a two-band scenario, cannot describe the observed low-temperature exponential behavior that can be inferred from the data.

We therefore focus our discussion on the possibility of two energy gaps, using the phenomenological two-band \alpha-model, introduced by Bouquet _et al._[15, 29] It allows a fit of the specific heat from low temperatures up to T_{c} and, as a result, gives reliable gap amplitudes that were shown to agree quantitatively with band calculations on MgB_{2} in particular,[15, 30] and with Eliashberg equations in general.[31] In this fit, the specific heat is taken as the sum of contributions from two bands, which are calculated independently assuming a BCS temperature dependence of the superconducting gaps. Two gap magnitudes, at T\!=\!0, are introduced as adjustable parameters, \alpha_{1}\!\!=\!\!\Delta_{1}(0)/k_{B}T_{c} and \alpha_{2}\!\!=\!\!\Delta_{2}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}, together with a third quantity, \gamma_{l}/\gamma_{h}(i\!=\!1,2), which measures the fraction of the total normal EDOS that the i-th band contributes to the superconducting condensate.[42] As shown in Fig. 3(b), the two-band fit (with \alpha_{1}\!\!=\!\!0.95, \alpha_{2}\!\!=\!\!2.2, and \gamma_{1}/\gamma_{n}\!\!=\!\!0.33) accurately reproduces the specific heat over the entire temperature range. These gap values conform to the theoretical constraints that one gap must be larger than the BCS gap and one smaller in a weakly coupled two-band superconductor.[32] Moreover, they are comparable with those derived from recent NMR (Ref. [33]) and \muSR-penetration-depth measurements[34] (see Table 2), but differ appreciably, by at least a factor 1.5, from ARPES data.[8]

Ba(Fe_{0.925}Co_{0.075})_{2}As_{2} also shares similar properties with NbSe_{2}, another candidate for multiband superconductivity, as illustrated by thermodynamic measurements[35, 36] and ARPES spectra.[37] The specific heat of both NbSe_{2} and Ba(Fe_{0.925}Co_{0.075})_{2}As_{2} show no sign of an incipient steep increase of C(T) below T_{c}, which is the conspicuous signature of the small gap in MgB_{2}.[14] This increase is particularly pronounced in MgB_{2} because (i) \Delta_{2}/\Delta_{1} is about twice as large as in Ba(Fe_{0.925}Co_{0.075})_{2}As_{2} and NbSe_{2}, (ii) each gap gives an equal contribution, \gamma_{2}/\gamma_{1}\!\!\approx\!1, to the specific heat of MgB_{2}. In contrast, in both NbSe_{2} and Ba(Fe_{0.925}Co_{0.075})_{2}As_{2} the major-gap contributions strongly dominate, with \gamma_{2}/\gamma_{1} roughly equal to 4 and 2.3, respectively.

We now discuss to what extent our results are consistent with the predicted s_{\pm}- order parameter.[4, 5, 6, 7] In Ba(Fe_{0.925}Co_{0.075})_{2}As_{2}, the major gap develops around the Fermi-surface sheet that shows the largest EDOS, while it is theoretically expected that \Delta_{1}/\Delta_{2}\!\propto\!\!\sqrt{N_{2}/N_{1}}, in the limit of pure interband pairing.[38] Our result is not incompatible with the s_{\pm}-state, and could indicate that either intraband interactions are significant (as pointed out in Ref. [38]), or that more than two bands are involved in the pairing mechanism.[39] The large residual EDOS observed in the superconducting state, in the present data, actually favors the s_{\pm}-state, since non-magnetic scattering centers (e.g., Co dopant) are expected to be pair breaking for this particular state in the Born limit.[6, 40]

In summary, a detailed analysis of the electronic specific heat of Ba(Fe_{0.925}Co_{0.075})_{2}As_{2} provides strong evidence of a multigap order parameter. Our data are fit very well by a two-band s-wave model. Further, we derive a reliable phonon contribution that permits to extract accurate values of the normal-state Sommerfeld coefficient.
