###### Abstract

Low-temperature specific heat (SH) has been measured in
K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ single crystals with T_(c) = 32 K. The SH anomaly
associated with the superconducting transition is moderate and sharp,
yielding a value of $\Delta C/T\mid_{\rm{rf}}=11.6\pm 1.0$ mJ/mol K².
The residual SH coefficient γ(0) in the superconducting state at T → 0
is very small with a value of about 0.39 mJ/mol K². The
magnetic-field-induced enhancement of the low-T SH exhibits a rough
linear feature indicating a nodeless gap. This is further supported by
the scaling based on the nodeless-gap approach of the low-T data at
different magnetic fields. A rough estimate indicates that the
normal-state SH coefficient $\gamma_{\rm{ss}}$ is about 6 ± 0.5 mJ/mol
K², leading to $\Delta C/\gamma_{\rm{ss}}T\mid_{\rm{rf}}=1.93$ and
placing this superconductor in the strong coupling region.

## I Introduction

The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in iron pnictides
has opened an era in the investigation of this superconducting
mechanism.[1] One of the key issues here is about the superconducting
pairing mechanism. Experimentally, it was found that the
superconductivity is at the vicinity of a long-range antiferromagnetic
(AF) order,[2] the superconducting transition temperature gets higher
when this AF order is suppressed. It was also further proven that the AF
spin fluctuation[3] and the multiband effect[4] are two key factors for
driving the system into superconductivity. Theoretically, several
different pairing symmetries are anticipated. It was suggested that the
pairing may be established via interpocket scattering of electrons
between the hole pockets (around the Γ point) and electron pockets
(around the M point), leading to the pairing manner of an isotropic gap
on each pocket but with opposite signs between them (the so-called
S^(±)).[5, 6, 7, 8] The pairing picture based on the superexchange of
local moments was also proposed, which in principle could also lead to
S^(±),[9, 10] leaving the others (d-wave or full-gapped S⁺⁺) as
perspectives with low possibility. However, the S⁺⁺ pairing manner is,
in particular, winning the vote when the orbital fluctuation plays the
important role, as argued by Onari and Kontani[11] Clearly multiorbits,
or the naturally formed multipockets are highly desirable for the
superconductivity of all these pairing models.

Recently, an Fe-based superconducting system A_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ (A =
alkaline metals, x ≤ 1, y ≤ 0.5) was discovered with a transition
temperature above 30 K.[12] The interest in this fascinating system was
immediate because of the two major reasons: (1) Both the band-structure
calculations[13, 14] and the preliminary angle resolved photoemission
spectrum (ARPES) measurements[15, 16, 17] indicate that the band near
the Γ point seems to dive far below the Fermi energy, leading to the
absence of hole pockets which are widely expected for the FeAs-based
systems. A consequence of these results is to question the importance of
the inter-hole-electron-pocket scattering for the superconducting
pairing. (2) The superconducting state seems to occur via a
transmutation from an insulating ordered state of Fe vacancies.[18] The
question raised here is whether this insulating state originates from
the Mottness, like in the cuprate,[19] or from the band gap due to the
reconstruction of the electronic structure when the Fe vacancies are
present. Many different kinds of pairing symmetries are proposed, such
as nodeless d-wave,[20]S⁺⁺, or S^(±), and all are satisfying with the
basic structures. To date, experimental evidence about the
superconducting gaps is quite rare. The ARPES measurements indicate
isotropic gaps on the four-electron pockets with a rather large gap
value (∼8-15 meV). The conclusions drawn from nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) measurements seem controversial.[21, 22] In this paper, we present
data of low-temperature specific-heat (SH) measurements. Our detailed
analysis indicates a nodeless gap with a strong coupling strength in
this superconducting system.

## II Sample preparation and experimental techniques

The K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ single crystals were synthesized by the
flux-growth method.[23] The typical dimension of the samples for
specific-heat measurements was 2 × 2 × 0.5 mm³. The SH measurements were
done with the thermal relaxation method on a Quantum Design instrument
physical property measurement system (PPMS) with the temperature down to
2 K and magnetic field up to 9 T. The magnetic field effect on the bare
SH measuring chip (including the four thermal conducting wires) of PPMS
from Quantum Design was calibrated prior to the measurements on the
samples in order to remove the pseudomorphism. This becomes very
essential since the contribution of the electronic SH is quite small
compared to the phonon part in this particular system. The details about
the correction will be presented later in combination with the
discussion of experimental data and shown in Figs. 4 and 5. In all the
measurements, the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the FeSe
planes. The dc magnetization measurements were done with a
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) from Quantum Design.

## III Results and discussion

In Fig. 1, we show the temperature dependence of specific heat and dc
magnetization for the sample. The sharp transition in the magnetization
and the large magnetic screening signal indicate the good quality of the
sample. In the SH data at zero field, one can see a small feature of
heat capacity anomaly at T_(c). We will show that this SH anomaly is
actually rather sharp with a reasonable magnitude.

The SH data for the sample in the low-temperature region are plotted as
C/T vs. T² in the inset of Fig. 2. No Schottky anomaly was detected. The
data below about 8 K can be fit by

C(T, H) = γ(H)T + βT³ + ηT⁵,
(1)

where γ(H)T is the residual SH coefficient in the magnetic field H and
βT³ + ηT⁵ is the phonon part of heat capacity. Normally it is
unnecessary to consider the last term ηT⁵ in the low-temperature region,
but this seems not to be the case for the present sample. One can see a
slight upturn curvature in the low-T SH data C/T vs. T². This is
understood because of the relatively low Debye temperature of the
sample, as discussed below.

For the heat capacity of the sample, the phonon contribution should be
identical in zero and nonzero magnetic field. Hence, the parameters β
and η should be the same for 0 and 9 T. This is a constraint in the
fitting process of the data. By fitting the SH data at 0 and 9 T using
Eq. (1), we obtained γ(0) ≈ 0.394 mJ/mol K², γ(9 T) ≈ 1.4 mJ/mol K²,
β ≈ 1.018 mJ/mol K⁴, and η ≈ 0.003 mJ/mol K⁶. Using the obtained value
of β and the relation Θ_(D) = [12π⁴k_(B)N_(A)Z/(5β)]^(1/3), where
N_(A) = 6.02 × 10²³ mol⁻¹ is the Avogadro constant and Z = 5 is the
number of atoms in one unit cell, we get the Debye temperature
Θ_(D) ≈ 212 K, which is relatively small compared to other FeAs-based
superconductors.[24, 25]

Figure 3(a) shows an enlarged view of the SH data near the transition
temperature plotted as C/T vs. T. One can see a clear SH anomaly at
T_(c) at 0 T and, when a magnetic field is applied, the SH anomaly was
weakened and shifted to lower temperatures. Figure 3(b) shows the
difference of the SH data between 0 and 9 T. The SH anomaly at T_(c) is
more obvious. We can evaluate the height of the SH anomaly

Figure 3: (Color online) Upper panel shows an enlarged view of the SH
data near the transition temperature plotted as C/T vs. T. The lower
panel shows the difference in the SH data between 0 and 9 T. The blue
solid lines here are just guides to the eye to show how we determine the
height of the SH anomaly.

Figure 2: (Color online) Main panel shows the SH data plotted as C/T vs.
T². The inset shows an enlarged view of the data together with the fit
(see text) in the low-temperature region. No Schottky anomaly was
detected.

ΔC/T|_(Tc) near T_(c) from the difference of C/T at 0 and 9 T. The
estimated anomaly ΔC/T|_(Tc) is about 11.6 ± 1 mJ/mol K². For the
optimally doped (Ba,K)Fe₂As₂ and Ba(Fe,Co)₂As₂, the SH anomaly
ΔC/T|_(Tc) is about 98 and 28.6 mJ/mol K², respectively.[25, 26, 27, 28,
29] The SH anomaly for K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ is also smaller than other
FeAs-based superconductors. It is also found that the empirical relation
ΔC/T|_(Tc) ∝ T_(c)² observed in K-doped or Co (Ni)-doped FeAs-122[26]
does not apply here. This may be induced by the possible missing of the
hole pocket, which leads to smaller ΔC/T_(c) in A_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂. The
SH anomaly looks rather sharp (it starts at about 32.9 K and ends at
30.9 K). We must emphasize that using the data measured at 9 T as the
background to deduce the SH anomaly is reasonable. As we discuss below,
a magnetic field of 9 T should have lowered the transition temperature
by about 5-6 K (with the upper critical field H_(c2)^(c)(0) ≈ 48 T),
being much larger than the width of the SH anomaly. The rather sharp SH
anomaly is very different from that in the underdoped cuprates in which
a long tail of electronic SH was observed far into the normal state.[30]
This was interpreted as fluctuating superconductivity. This may suggest
that, although having a low superfluid density and relatively higher
anisotropy,[31] the superconducting transition in A_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂
superconductors can still be described quite well by the critical
mean-field theory without the necessity of categorizing it into the
strong critical fluctuation.

Before proceeding with further analysis of the SH data, we shall
illustrate the process of SH measurement and data processing. As
mentioned above, the SH measurement was carried out on a Quantum Design
PPMS, using the heat capacity (HC) option. In this instrument, the
sample is put on a small chip on the back of which are attached two
resistors that function as a thermometer and a heater. The sample SH is
obtained by subtracting the total SH of the chip and sample from the SH
of a bare chip. We use this procedure in different magnetic fields to
figure out the behavior of the sample in magnetic fields. But the
magnetic fields have little influence on the resistance of the
thermometer on the chip (the field dependence of the SH of the chip can
be ignored, see the HC manual of PPMS). Theoretically, if we calibrate
the resistance of the thermometer in a magnetic field, we could get an
accurate value of SH. But in practice, according to our experience, this
method cannot fully remove the influence of the magnetic field (we have
measured several samples, such as Nb and Au, to test this method). Thus,
we take another approach. We do not take the calibration, but measure
the SH of the bare chip in the magnetic field directly. As revealed in
the data, the SH of the chip, which was supposed to be
field-independent, seems field-dependent. This field dependence of the
SH of the chip is actually given by the field dependence of the
thermometer, and this could be treated as the magnetic field background,
as shown in Fig. 4(a). This is a background with systematics and is
enlarged proportionally when the sample is mounted on the chip.
Therefore, we get the final SH of the sample as
C(H) = C_(meas)^(H) − C_(bkg)(C_(total)⁰/C_(chip)⁰), where C_(meas)^(H)
is the measured SH of the sample at a field H, C_(bkg) is the background
shown in Fig. 4(a), C_(total)⁰ is the total SH of the sample and the
chip at zero field, and C_(chip)⁰ is the SH data of the chip measured at
zero field. By removing this background, we obtain the SH of the sample
in a magnetic field. In our experience, this method works better, and it
is also tested by measuring Nb and Au. Here we notice that, although the
background is larger in higher temperature, as shown in Fig. 4(a), it
actually has little influence on the high-T region of SH data, because
the heat capacity increases more rapidly. Even if we only consider the
phonon SH, it is a T³ law with increasing temperature. Usually, the
magnetic effect can be ignored above 20 K. In Fig. 4(b), we show the 9-T
SH data of the sample in the low-T region before and after subtracting
the background. One can see that there is a small correction to the raw
data. Although this method works better, there would be still little
residual background, which has a lager effect when the electronic SH is
small and in high magnetic field, as shown below.

Figure 5 shows the SH data plotted as C/T vs. T² in the low-temperature
region under various magnetic fields. One can see that the magnetic
field enhances the SH coefficient progressively, indicating the
generation of the quasiparticle density of sates. Panel (a) of Fig. 5
presents the difference in the SH data between a typical magnetic field
and zero field and the dashed lines are the linear fit of the difference
in the temperature region of 2.4 to 4 K. The slight bending down of the
data here below about 2.4 K at fields of 5, 7, and

Figure 4: (Color online) (a) Magnetic field background measured for the
bare chip, C_(bkg)(H) = C(H) − C(0), raw data are plotted as C vs. T.

T, before and after subtracting the background.

9 T was recognized as due to the unsuccessful removal of the magnetic
field effect on the SH measuring chip. This would have a more obvious
effect on high-magnetic-field data, and especially in the low-T region.
As shown in panel (a) of Fig. 5, the difference in SH data for 9 and 0 T
is a little tilted, rather than a rough constant, so we extracted the
data at T = 3 K as the field-induced term of SH. Using the linear fit
(between 2.4 and 4 K) in panel (a), we can obtain the
magnetic-field-induced enhancement of the low-T SH, and the extracted
data at T = 3 K are shown in Fig. 5(b). It is clear that the
field-induced term exhibits a roughly linear field dependence. This is
very different from the cuprates, in which a square-root relation
$\Delta\gamma\propto\sqrt{H}$ was observed widely in many kinds of
materials.[32; 33; 34; 35; 36; 37] In combination with the fact that a
very small residual SH term was observed in the superconducting state of
K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ as T → 0, we are tempted to conclude a nodeless gap.

In order to further confirm this point, we analyzed the SH data in the
finite-temperature region in the mixed state. It is known that the
quasiparticle excitations in superconductors with different gap
symmetries can be obviously distinct. In s-wave superconductors, the
inner-core states dominate the quasiparticle excitations and,
consequently, a simple scaling law
$C_{\rm QP}/T^{3}\approx C_{\rm core}/T^{3}=\gamma_{n}/H_{c2}(0)\times(T/\sqrt {H})^{-2}$
for the fully gapped superconductors is expected, where $C_{\rm QP}$ and
$C_{\rm core}$ are the specific heat of the quasiparticles induced by
field and that from the vortex cores in the mixed state, respectively.
This scaling was proposed by Liu _et al.[38]_ for the possible s-wave
gap in electron-doped cuprate superconductor Sr_(0.9)La_(0.1)CuO₄. Here
we use the $T/\sqrt{H}$ as the variable in order to have a comparison
with the d-wave. Although for the nodeless d-wave and S⁺⁺ we do not have
the available theoretical formula, for the low-energy density of states
(DOS) under a field we would assume that they behave more like the case
of a full gap; here, we generally call it a nodeless gap. Therefore, we
will adopt this scaling of a nodeless gap to check our present sample.
For a gap with line nodes, the excitation spectrum is dominated by the
extended quasiparticles outside the vortex cores and the so-called
Simon-Lee scaling
law[39]$C_{\rm QP}/(T/\sqrt{H})\approx C_{\rm Vol}/(T/\sqrt{H})=f(T/\sqrt{H})$
should be obeyed, where $C_{\rm Vol}$ is the specific heat of the
extended states outside the vortex cores predicted by Volovik.[40] The
scaling result of the field-induced term in the mixed state with the
nodeless condition is presented in Fig. 6(a) and the d-wave scaling is
shown in Fig. 6(b). One can see that the nodeless scaling is better than
the d-wave scaling; all the data at different magnetic fields can be
roughly scaled to the straight blue line in Fig. 6(a), which reflects
the theoretical curve $C_{\rm cal-\it s}=0.12(T/\sqrt{H})^{-2}$.
Generally, this prefactor γ_(n)/H_(c2)(0) = 0.12 mJ/(mol K² T) is
consistent with the magnitude of the slope of the line in Fig. 5(b).
Using the value of H_(c2)^(c)(0) ≈ 48 T,[23] we estimate the value of
normal-state electron SH coefficient γ_(n) to be 5.8 mJ/mol K², which is
a small value compared to other FeAs-based superconductors.[25; 26; 27;
28; 29]

As far as we know, reliable calculated values for the normal-state DOS
and thus the SH coefficient of this superconductor are still lacking
because of the uncertainties in the structure of these Fe vacancies. The
value γ_(n) ≈ 6 mJ/mol K² found here will give some hint about the
band-structure calculations

the linear fit of this difference between 2.4 and 4 K. The slight
bending down of the data at 5, 7, and 9 T was recognized as due to the
unsuccessful removal of the magnetic field effect on the SH measuring
chip. Inset (b): Field dependence of the field-induced term

as well as help in understanding the ARPES data. The value
ΔC/γ_(π)T∣_(τ) = 1.93 clearly places the system in the strong coupling
camp, since the weak coupling BCS theory gives 1.43. Furthermore, the
very small residual SH coefficient γ^(′)(0) ≈ 0.39 mJ/mol K² together
with the nodeless-gap scaling excludes nodal gaps in this system. This
is consistent with the ARPES data to date and in contradiction with the
NMR data.[22] The small γ(0) detected here excludes also the chemical
phase separation picture, since otherwise a much more significant value,
arising from the nonsuperconducting normal metallic regions, should be
observed. However, if the system is chemically separated into the
superconducting regions and the insulating regions which are fully
gapped (for example, the Fe vacancies are ordered), this is of course
acceptable. Our results here are also probably against the
nodeless-d-wave picture since that kind of pairing may be sensitive to
impurity scattering, as for S^(±) pairing,[41] which would give rise to
a large quasiparticle DOS provided the appropriate scattering potentials
are present, and this large DOS should be detectable by specific heat.
The sharp SH anomaly found here indicates that the present system does
not have the strong critical fluctuation which appears in the underdoped
cuprates.

## IV Summary

In summary, we measured the low-temperature SH of single-crystal
K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ in various magnetic fields. The SH anomaly is
observed at T_(c) = 32 K and the height ΔC/T∣_(T_(c)) is about 11.6
mJ/mol K². From the low-temperature part of the SH data, we obtained the
field-induced enhancement of the low-T SH, which exhibits a roughly
linear field dependence, indicating a nodeless gap. We also analyzed the
data with the s-wave scaling law, and found that the data roughly obey
this law, indicating again a nodeless gap. These approaches are
self-consistent with each other. The Debye temperature and the
normal-state electronic SH coefficient were also estimated; both are
smaller than that found in other FeAs-based superconductors.
