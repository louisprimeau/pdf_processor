###### Abstract

Single crystals of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir) are synthesized by a Sn-flux method. Superconducting transition temperatures T_{c} are determined on the basis of magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity measurements. For La_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13}, T_{c} = 3.1 and 2.5 K when T = Rh and Ir, respectively; similarly, for Sr_{1}T_{4}Sn_{13}, T_{c} = 4.2 and 5.0 K. Specific heat measurements indicate that superconducting gaps of these compounds are isotropic and that these superconductors can be categorized as strong-coupling superconductors on the basis of the values of \Delta C_{c}/\gamma T_{c} and 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}. The upper critical field shows a clear enhancement with respect to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg prediction; this enhancement is consistent with the presence of a strong electron-phonon coupling. We summarized the normal and superconducting parameters of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir) in Table 1.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in the ternary stannide compounds R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (cubic, so-called phase I) and R_{5}T_{6}Sn_{18} (distorted cubic, so-called phase II) has attracted considerable attention as it facilitates a better understanding of the relationship between superconductivity and magnetism.[1] Magnetic transition is observed in the case of R_{5}Rh_{6}Sn_{18} (R = Tb, Dy, Ho), and reentrant superconductivity is observed in the case of R_{5}Rh_{6}Sn_{18} (R = Er, Tm); it is also observed that magnetic ordering destroys superconductivity in the region of superconducting transition temperature T_{c}> magnetic transition temperature T_{M}.[2, 3, 4]

The ternary stannides Ca_{3}Rh_{6}Sn_{13} and Yb_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13}, which have a phase-I structure,[5] exhibit superconductivity at T_{c}\sim8.0 K. The M-H curves of these compounds exhibit a peak effect[6, 7] around H_{c2}(T). While the phase-I structure of Yb_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13} exhibits slight structural modifications owing to a disorder between the Sn and Yb sites, Ca_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13} does not experience any such disorder, always adopting the phase-I structure.[8] This phase-I structure is closely related to the cage-type structure observed in filled skutterudites.[9]

Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh and Ir) shows superconductivity at T_{c}\sim 5 = K.[1] Although a previous study had reported on the occurrence of superconductivity in Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13}, there has been no study that provides detailed information on the superconducting parameters of these materials. La_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh and Ir) shows superconductivity at T_{c}\sim 3 K.[1] The Rh-based superconductor La_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13} is known to possess several critical temperatures in the range of 2.07-3.2 K.[10, 11] The compound having T_{c} = 2.07 K is a strong-coupling superconductor as obtained from the expression \Delta C_{p}/\gamma T_{c}\approx 2.[10] Although several experiments have been performed on poly = single-crystalline samples in the Rh compound,[10, 11] there has been no detailed investigation of the superconducting state of the Ir compound.

We successfully synthesized the single crystals of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = Sr, La; T = Rh, Ir) in order to analyze its superconducting state. In this study, superconducting states of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = Sr, La; T = Rh, Ir) were analyzed by measuring its magnetic susceptibility \chi(T), magnetization M(H), electrical resistivity \rho(T), and specific heat C(T) using the single crystals.

## II Experimental

Single crystals of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = Sr, La; T = Rh, Ir) were synthesized by a Sn-flux method. The starting materials were La powder (99.9%), Sr bulk (99.9%), Rh powder (99.9%), Ir powder (99.9%), and Sn shot (99.999%). All the starting materials, having an off-stoichiometric composition of La or Sr : Rh or Ir : Sn = 1 : 1.33 : 10 were placed in an alumina crucible encapsulated in a quartz tube. The quartz tube was heated up to 1050, maintained at this temperature for approximately 3 h, and then cooled down to 200 at the rate of 5/h; this entire process takes 7 days. The Sn flux was removed by spinning the materials in a centrifuge; the centrifugation process removed most of the flux contamination from the surfaces of the single crystals; the remaining topical flux, if any, was etched using concentrated HCl. Many single crystals of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} have typical dimensions of 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 mm3.

The single-crystalline nature of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = Sr, La; T = Rh, Ir) was verified using a backscattering x-ray technique. The presence of well-defined Laue diffraction spots on the surface indicated the superior quality of the single crystals. As shown in Fig. 1, the crystal structure of the obtained polycrystalline sample was examined by the powder x-ray diffraction technique using a conventional x-ray spectrometer equipped with a graphite monochromator (RINT-1100 RIGAKU). Single crystal samples were crushed into a very fine powder and analyzed by powder x-ray diffraction by using Cu K\alpha radiation. The intensity data were collected by applying Cu K\alpha radiation to the sample over a 2th range of 5deg-80deg with a step width of 0.02deg and a counting time of 4deg/minute. The jade software is used to index all the peaks and to determine the lattice constants. The obtained powder x-ray diffraction patterns were indexed as the R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir) phase with the space group Pm\bar{3}n. The lattice parameters were reported to be a = 0.97457(1) and 0.97550(3) nm where T = Rh and Ir, respectively; similarly, for Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13}, these constants were determined to be a = 0.98048(3) and 0.98159(5) nm. These values are in good agreement with  previously reported data; the lattice parameters were reported to be a=0.9745, 0.9751 nm for La_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir)^{1} and a=0.9801, 0.9807 nm for Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir),^{1} respectively.

The crystal compositions were determined by averaging the compositions of ten different regions of each crystal using an electron-probe microanalyzer equipped with wavelength dispersive spectrometers (EPMA-WDS; JEOL JXA8200S). The chemical composition of the samples was determined to be La_{3.1(2)}Rh_{4.0(1)}Sn_{13.2(2)}, La_{3.1(1)}Ir_{4.0(1)}Sn_{13.6(2)}, Sr_{3.0(2)}Rh_{4.0(1)}Sn_{13.3(2)}, and Sr_{3.1(2)}Ir_{4.0(2)}Sn_{13.6(2)}, respectively. These values are similar to the stoichiometric compositions of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13}, although the ratio of Sn is slightly large.

Magnetic susceptibility and other magnetization parameters were measured using a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS) in a temperature range of 1.8-6.0 K under various applied magnetic fields. Electrical resistivity was measured by a conventional DC four-probe method in a temperature range of 0.4-7.0 K under zero magnetic field and various applied magnetic fields. Specific heat measurements were conducted using a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) equipped with a ^{3}He refrigerator in a temperature range of 0.4-6.0 K.

## III Crystal Structure

R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir) crystallizes to form a Yb_{2}Rh_{4}Sn_{13}-type structure [12] in the Pm\bar{3}n space group (No. 223), as shown in Fig. 2. The lattice parameters were reported to be a=0.9745 and 0.9751 nm for La_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir),^{1} and a=0.9801 and 0.9807 nm for Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir),^{1} respectively. The Sn_{13} atoms occupy the origin of the unit cell and form edge-sharing Sn_{1}(Sn_{2})_{12} icosahedra which pack in a CsCl arrangement. The faces of each Sn_{1} icosahedron in the network make contact with TSn_{6} trigonal prisms and 12R-centered cuboctahedra-like. This feature is similar to the BO_{6} octahedra in AA_{3}B_{4}O_{12}-type compounds [13, 14] and also to the TPn_{6} (Pn1/4 pnictogen) octahedra found in the structures of skutterudites such as LaFe_{4}P_{12}. [15]

## IV Magnetic Properties

R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir) was found to exhibit superconductivity as it shows magnetic susceptibility \chi(T) in a magnetic field of 10 Oe, as shown in Fig. 3. A large Meissner signal was clearly observed in the \chi(T) curve below T_{c} = 4.2, 5.0 K for Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir) and T_{c} = 3.1, 2.5 K for La_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir), respectively. While shielding by supercurrents comprises the whole sample volume (zero-field-cooled curves, considering demagnetizing factor and the high porosity of the samples) the field-cooling Meissner effect is less than unity. This incomplete Meissner effect is well known to be due to strong pinning.

The magnetic field dependence of magnetization M(H) of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir) was observed at several temperatures; this dependence is shown in Fig. 4.

Figure 2: (Color online) Crystal structure of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir). Sn1 is surrounded by the 12 × Sn2 cluster. The structure highlights the arrangement of the Sn1(Sn2)_{12} icosahedra (light blue), with T atoms (red circles) bonding to Sn2 atoms to form trigonal prisms. For simplicity, the R atoms (green circles) are represented as isolated atoms. (The program VESTA is used. [32])

 These compounds exhibited the butterfly curve, which is representative of the typical type-II superconducting behavior. We attempted to estimate the lower critical field H_{\rm c1}(0) at various temperatures using the M-H curve. However, because the temperature region is very narrow (above 1.8 K) for La compounds, we believe that the estimation of the lower critical field from the M-H curve will not provide accurate results. Hence, we estimated the lower critical field H_{\rm c1}(0) from the thermodynamic field using specific heat measurements.

## V Specific heat

The inset of Fig. 5 shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat C_{p} for La materials in the temperature range of 0.4-4.0 K under a zero and 3 T magnetic field and the same for Sr materials in the temperature range of 0.4-6.0 K under a zero and 5 T magnetic field. The bulk nature of the superconductivity and superior quality of the samples are confirmed by a sharp anomaly at T_{c} = 2.5 and 3.1 K for La_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} and La_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13}, respectively, and at T_{c} = 4.15 and 4.95 K for Sr_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13} and Sr_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13}, respectively; these values are in good agreement with the values of T_{c} determined using \chi(T).

A standard analysis is conducted under magnetic fields whose values exceed those of the upper critical fields; this analysis yields Sommerfeld constant \gamma and the Debye temperature \Theta_{D}, which is calculated from \beta=N(12/5)\pi^{4}R\Theta_{D}^{-3}, where R = 8.314 J/(K mol) and N = 20. To analyze the specific heat data, we use the expression C_{n}(T) = \gamma T + \beta T^{3} + \delta T^{5}, where \gamma T is the electronic contribution (= C_{e}), \gamma is the electronic specific heat coefficient (Sommerfeld constant), and \beta T^{3} + \delta T^{5} (= C_{p}) is contributed by phonons. However, the specific heat of Sr compounds under a magnetic field shows a fractional drop at a low-temperature region. Although the reason behind the anomaly is not clear (one of the reasons is the existence of rattling), the T^{5} correlation term is certainly inadequate for a system containing an anomaly of phonons such as KOs_{2}O_{6}.[16] To fit the specific heat data, we use an equation with a correction term; this equation is given as C_{n}(T) = \gamma_T_ + \beta T^{3} + \sum_{n=2}^{4}\delta_{2n+1}T^{2n+1}, where the third term is the correction term.[7] The obtained values of \gamma (mJ/K^{2} mol) and \Theta_{D} (K) are 22.2 and 284 for La_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13}, 19.2 and 296 for La_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13}, 31.0 and 252 for Sr_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13}, and 39.3 and 184 for Sr_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13}, respectively.

The solid curve of Fig. 5 represents the fitting result obtained by using the specific heat expression for a conventional superconductor (C_{e}\sim\exp[-\Delta(0)/k_{B}T], where \Delta(0) is the energy gap) below 0.8T_{c}. Under a zero magnetic field, C_{e}(T) behaves as an exponential dependence on temperature at low temperatures. From the exponential dependence curve, the superconducting energy gap \Delta(0) (meV) at T = 0 can be estimated to be 0.505, 0.389 for La_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir) and 0.692, 0.870 for Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir), respectively.

By using these values, we estimated \Delta C_{e}/\gamma T_{c} to be approximately 1.84, 1.64 for La_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir), 1.78, 2.09 for Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir), respectively. These values are relatively larger than those expected from the BCS theory (\Delta C_{e}/\gamma T_{c} = 1.43). Moreover, 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} is calculated to

  be approximately 3.78, 3.61 for La_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir), and 3.87, 4.08 for Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir), respectively. These values are also larger than those expected from the BCS theory [2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} = 3.54]. From these results, we concluded that all the materials can be categorized as strong-coupling superconductors.

The thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(T) is one of the most important parameters for characterizing the nature of the superconducting ground state, because it is directly related to the condensation energy by the expression \Delta F = \mu_{0}H_{c}^{2}/8\pi. H_{c}(T) is deduced from the specific heat data obtained at H = 0 using the relation

\[\Delta F(T)=F_{n}-F_{s}=\frac{\mu_{0}H_{c}^{2}(T)}{8\pi}=\int_{T_{c}}^{T}dT^{ \prime}\int_{T_{c}}^{T^{\prime}}\frac{C_{e}}{T^{\prime\prime}}dT^{\prime\prime}.\] (1)

The temperature dependence of H_{c}(T) is shown in Fig. 6. As shown in the inset of Fig. 6, H_{c} follows the parabolic form H_{c} =   to T = 0 using the fifth power of the polynomial function of T. For Sr3T4Sn13, the _H_c2(0) value was calculated to be approximately 2.50 and 3.54 T, where T = Rh and Ir, respectively. The _H_c2(0) value was calculated to be 1.02 for La3T4Sn13, where T = Rh, Ir.

Such an enhancement of _H_c2(_T_) on the basis of the WHH prediction has been attributed to several different origins such as the localization effects in highly disordered superconductors,[20] anisotropy of the Fermi surface,[21] and strong electron-phonon coupling.[22,23] When the _e_-ph coupling is in the strong-coupling regime, _H_c2(_T_) starts to deviate from the WHH curve, remains linear as it moves toward lower temperatures, and finally has an upward curvature for a higher _e_-ph coupling. The present heat capacity measurements suggest that the R3_T_4Sn13 (_R_ = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir) belongs to a strong-coupling BCS superconductor with an isotropic _s_-wave pairing symmetry. It is inferred from these results that _H_c2 enhancement cannot be because of the Fermi surface properties, but because of strong coupling. In addition, because these measurements were performed using pure single crystals, the localization effect due to impurity does not enhance the upper critical field.

On the basis of the _H_c2(0) and _H_c(0) values, we estimated the superconducting parameters for R3_T_4Sn13 (_R_ = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir). According to the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory, the GL coherence length \xi(0) and the GL parameter \kappa(0) = \lambda(0)/\xi(0) can be obtained from the upper critical field _H_c2(0), the lower critical field _H_c1(0), and the thermodynamic critical field _H_c(0) using the following equations:

\[H_{c2}(0) = \frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi(0)},\]

\[H_{c1}(0) = \frac{H_{c}^{2}}{H_{c2}(0)}[\ln\kappa(0) + 0.08],\]

\[H_{c}(0) = \frac{H_{c2}(  

## VII Discussion

In the case of _e_-ph coupled superconductors, Carbotte [24] has proposed that the characteristic thermodynamic quantities are computed using empirical formulas that can be described by one adjustable parameter, x = _o_in/_T_c; _o_in is the logarithmic averaged phonon frequency. These formulas are

\[\frac{\Delta C_{e}(T_{c})}{\gamma\,T_{c}} = 1.43\left[ {1 + 53x^{- 2}\ln\frac{x}{3}} \right\rbrack,\] (5) \[\frac{2\Delta(0)}{k_{B}T_{c}} = 3.54\left[ {1 + 12.5x^{- 2}\ln\frac{x}{2}} \right\rbrack,\] (6) \[\frac{\gamma\,T_{c}^{2}}{H_{c}^{2}(0)} = 0.168\left[ {1 - 12.2x^{- 2}\ln\frac{x}{3}} \right\rbrack.\] (7)

This analysis has been successfully applied to various metal-alloy superconductors; [24] to other recently discovered carbon-containing superconductors such as borocarbides, [25, 26] MgCNi_{3}, [27] and La_{2}C_{3}; [28] and to rattling-induced superconductors. [16, 29]

The thermodynamic quantities were estimated by varying x = _o_in/_T_c in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7); they were estimated to be approximately 18.3, 20.2, and 24.7 for La_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13}; 26.3, 40.8, and 19.0 for La_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13}; 19.6, 16.5, and 11.8 for Sr_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13}; and 12.9, 11.9, and 19.0 for Sr_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13}, respectively. From the three values of x and _T_c, we obtain mean value of _o_in = 65.3 \pm 5.9, 71.8 \pm 28 K for La_{3}Ta_{3}Ta_{3} (_T_ = Rh, Ir) and _o_in = 66.3 \pm 9.4, 73.0 \pm 11 K for Sr_{3}Ta_{3}Sn_{13} (_T_ = Rh, Ir), respectively. This _o_in value is only 20%\sim40% of the Debye temperature _o_D (200\sim300 K). The Debye frequency is determined only from the phonon DOS profile _F_(_o_), while _o_in results are obtained on the basis of a weighting using the _e_-ph coupling function a2(_o_). Such a reduced values of _o_in as compared to that of _o_D indicates the importance of the low-energy phonon modes for the superconductivity.

The electron-phonon coupling constant (_l_ph) can be estimated using the well-known McMillan formula refined by Allen and Dynes: [24, 30, 31]

\[\lambda_{\rm ph} = \frac{1.04 + \mu^{*}\ln(\omega_{\rm ln}/1.2T_{c})}{(1 - 0.62\mu^{*})\ln(\omega_{\rm ln}/1.2T_{c})-1.04},\] (8)

where \mu^{*} is the Coulomb pseudopotential and is fixed to be 0.10. The obtained values are estimated to be 0.805, 0.647 for La_{3}Ta_{3}Sn_{13} (_T_ = Rh, Ir) and 0.936, 0.983 for Sr_{3}Ta_{3}Sn_{13} (_T_ = Rh, Ir), respectively. Because of the calculated l \sim 1, Sr_{3}Ta_{3}Sn_{13} (_T_ = Rh, Ir) can be categorized as a strong-coupling superconductor; this categorization is in good agreement with the results of specific heat measurements. In the case of La_{3}Ta_{3}Sn_{13}, the calculated values of l are slightly lesser than 1.0, which is indicative of a moderate-coupling

 superconductor. These results are almost consistent with those of specific heat measurements.

The electronic density of states at the Fermi level, N(E_{F}), is expressed by the following relationship:

\[N(E_{F})=\frac{3\gamma}{\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}(1+\lambda_{\rm ph})}.\] (9)

As shown in the above equation, N(E_{F}) can be derived from the given \gamma and \lambda_{\rm ph}. Using this relationship, we estimated N(E_{F}) [states/(eV f.u.); f.u. denotes formula units] to be approximately 5.22, 4.95 for La_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir) and 6.80, 8.41 for Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir), respectively. As shown in Fig. 9(a), both N(E_{F}) and \lambda_{\rm ph} increase with the transition temperature. The \gamma is increasing with increasing transition temperature, as shown in Fig. 9(b). Therefore, we assume that the difference in both N(E_{F}) and \lambda_{\rm ph} [\gamma_{\rm observed} = (1+\lambda)\gamma_{\rm theoretical}] results in a difference in superconducting transition temperatures.

In the previous report, the N(E_{F}) of La_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13} was obtained from band calculation with the LAPW method.[10] The calculated N(E_{F}) is 5.58 states/(eV f.u.), which is in good agreement with that obtained from the above method. Thus, both the obtained N(E_{F}) and \lambda_{\rm ph} of La_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13} are relatively reliable values.

In conclusion, we succeeded in synthesizing single crystals of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir) and analyzed the physical properties of these compounds by measuring their magnetic susceptibility \chi(T), electrical resistivity \rho(T), and magnetization M(H). Specific heat measurements indicated that R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} could be described as a conventional BCS superconductor in the strong-coupling regime. On the basis of the temperature dependence of C_{e} below T_{e}, we conclude that the symmetry of superconductivity of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} corresponds to an isotropic s-wave symmetry.

###### Abstract

Single crystals of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir) are synthesized by a Sn-flux method. Superconducting transition temperatures T_{c} are determined on the basis of magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity measurements. For La_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13}, T_{c} = 3.1 and 2.5 K when T = Rh and Ir, respectively; similarly, for Sr_{1}T_{4}Sn_{13}, T_{c} = 4.2 and 5.0 K. Specific heat measurements indicate that superconducting gaps of these compounds are isotropic and that these superconductors can be categorized as strong-coupling superconductors on the basis of the values of \Delta C_{c}/\gamma T_{c} and 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}. The upper critical field shows a clear enhancement with respect to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg prediction; this enhancement is consistent with the presence of a strong electron-phonon coupling. We summarized the normal and superconducting parameters of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir) in Table 1.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in the ternary stannide compounds R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (cubic, so-called phase I) and R_{5}T_{6}Sn_{18} (distorted cubic, so-called phase II) has attracted considerable attention as it facilitates a better understanding of the relationship between superconductivity and magnetism.[1] Magnetic transition is observed in the case of R_{5}Rh_{6}Sn_{18} (R = Tb, Dy, Ho), and reentrant superconductivity is observed in the case of R_{5}Rh_{6}Sn_{18} (R = Er, Tm); it is also observed that magnetic ordering destroys superconductivity in the region of superconducting transition temperature T_{c}> magnetic transition temperature T_{M}.[2, 3, 4]

The ternary stannides Ca_{3}Rh_{6}Sn_{13} and Yb_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13}, which have a phase-I structure,[5] exhibit superconductivity at T_{c}\sim8.0 K. The M-H curves of these compounds exhibit a peak effect[6, 7] around H_{c2}(T). While the phase-I structure of Yb_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13} exhibits slight structural modifications owing to a disorder between the Sn and Yb sites, Ca_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13} does not experience any such disorder, always adopting the phase-I structure.[8] This phase-I structure is closely related to the cage-type structure observed in filled skutterudites.[9]

Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh and Ir) shows superconductivity at T_{c}\sim 5 = K.[1] Although a previous study had reported on the occurrence of superconductivity in Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13}, there has been no study that provides detailed information on the superconducting parameters of these materials. La_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh and Ir) shows superconductivity at T_{c}\sim 3 K.[1] The Rh-based superconductor La_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13} is known to possess several critical temperatures in the range of 2.07-3.2 K.[10, 11] The compound having T_{c} = 2.07 K is a strong-coupling superconductor as obtained from the expression \Delta C_{p}/\gamma T_{c}\approx 2.[10] Although several experiments have been performed on poly = single-crystalline samples in the Rh compound,[10, 11] there has been no detailed investigation of the superconducting state of the Ir compound.

We successfully synthesized the single crystals of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = Sr, La; T = Rh, Ir) in order to analyze its superconducting state. In this study, superconducting states of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = Sr, La; T = Rh, Ir) were analyzed by measuring its magnetic susceptibility \chi(T), magnetization M(H), electrical resistivity \rho(T), and specific heat C(T) using the single crystals.

## II Experimental

Single crystals of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = Sr, La; T = Rh, Ir) were synthesized by a Sn-flux method. The starting materials were La powder (99.9%), Sr bulk (99.9%), Rh powder (99.9%), Ir powder (99.9%), and Sn shot (99.999%). All the starting materials, having an off-stoichiometric composition of La or Sr : Rh or Ir : Sn = 1 : 1.33 : 10 were placed in an alumina crucible encapsulated in a quartz tube. The quartz tube was heated up to 1050, maintained at this temperature for approximately 3 h, and then cooled down to 200 at the rate of 5/h; this entire process takes 7 days. The Sn flux was removed by spinning the materials in a centrifuge; the centrifugation process removed most of the flux contamination from the surfaces of the single crystals; the remaining topical flux, if any, was etched using concentrated HCl. Many single crystals of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} have typical dimensions of 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 mm3.

The single-crystalline nature of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = Sr, La; T = Rh, Ir) was verified using a backscattering x-ray technique. The presence of well-defined Laue diffraction spots on the surface indicated the superior quality of the single crystals. As shown in Fig. 1, the crystal structure of the obtained polycrystalline sample was examined by the powder x-ray diffraction technique using a conventional x-ray spectrometer equipped with a graphite monochromator (RINT-1100 RIGAKU). Single crystal samples were crushed into a very fine powder and analyzed by powder x-ray diffraction by using Cu K\alpha radiation. The intensity data were collected by applying Cu K\alpha radiation to the sample over a 2th range of 5deg-80deg with a step width of 0.02deg and a counting time of 4deg/minute. The jade software is used to index all the peaks and to determine the lattice constants. The obtained powder x-ray diffraction patterns were indexed as the R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir) phase with the space group Pm\bar{3}n. The lattice parameters were reported to be a = 0.97457(1) and 0.97550(3) nm where T = Rh and Ir, respectively; similarly, for Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13}, these constants were determined to be a = 0.98048(3) and 0.98159(5) nm. These values are in good agreement with  previously reported data; the lattice parameters were reported to be a=0.9745, 0.9751 nm for La_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir)^{1} and a=0.9801, 0.9807 nm for Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir),^{1} respectively.

The crystal compositions were determined by averaging the compositions of ten different regions of each crystal using an electron-probe microanalyzer equipped with wavelength dispersive spectrometers (EPMA-WDS; JEOL JXA8200S). The chemical composition of the samples was determined to be La_{3.1(2)}Rh_{4.0(1)}Sn_{13.2(2)}, La_{3.1(1)}Ir_{4.0(1)}Sn_{13.6(2)}, Sr_{3.0(2)}Rh_{4.0(1)}Sn_{13.3(2)}, and Sr_{3.1(2)}Ir_{4.0(2)}Sn_{13.6(2)}, respectively. These values are similar to the stoichiometric compositions of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13}, although the ratio of Sn is slightly large.

Magnetic susceptibility and other magnetization parameters were measured using a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS) in a temperature range of 1.8-6.0 K under various applied magnetic fields. Electrical resistivity was measured by a conventional DC four-probe method in a temperature range of 0.4-7.0 K under zero magnetic field and various applied magnetic fields. Specific heat measurements were conducted using a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) equipped with a ^{3}He refrigerator in a temperature range of 0.4-6.0 K.

## III Crystal Structure

R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir) crystallizes to form a Yb_{2}Rh_{4}Sn_{13}-type structure [12] in the Pm\bar{3}n space group (No. 223), as shown in Fig. 2. The lattice parameters were reported to be a=0.9745 and 0.9751 nm for La_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir),^{1} and a=0.9801 and 0.9807 nm for Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir),^{1} respectively. The Sn_{13} atoms occupy the origin of the unit cell and form edge-sharing Sn_{1}(Sn_{2})_{12} icosahedra which pack in a CsCl arrangement. The faces of each Sn_{1} icosahedron in the network make contact with TSn_{6} trigonal prisms and 12R-centered cuboctahedra-like. This feature is similar to the BO_{6} octahedra in AA_{3}B_{4}O_{12}-type compounds [13, 14] and also to the TPn_{6} (Pn1/4 pnictogen) octahedra found in the structures of skutterudites such as LaFe_{4}P_{12}. [15]

## IV Magnetic Properties

R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir) was found to exhibit superconductivity as it shows magnetic susceptibility \chi(T) in a magnetic field of 10 Oe, as shown in Fig. 3. A large Meissner signal was clearly observed in the \chi(T) curve below T_{c} = 4.2, 5.0 K for Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir) and T_{c} = 3.1, 2.5 K for La_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir), respectively. While shielding by supercurrents comprises the whole sample volume (zero-field-cooled curves, considering demagnetizing factor and the high porosity of the samples) the field-cooling Meissner effect is less than unity. This incomplete Meissner effect is well known to be due to strong pinning.

The magnetic field dependence of magnetization M(H) of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir) was observed at several temperatures; this dependence is shown in Fig. 4.

Figure 2: (Color online) Crystal structure of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir). Sn1 is surrounded by the 12 × Sn2 cluster. The structure highlights the arrangement of the Sn1(Sn2)_{12} icosahedra (light blue), with T atoms (red circles) bonding to Sn2 atoms to form trigonal prisms. For simplicity, the R atoms (green circles) are represented as isolated atoms. (The program VESTA is used. [32])

 These compounds exhibited the butterfly curve, which is representative of the typical type-II superconducting behavior. We attempted to estimate the lower critical field H_{\rm c1}(0) at various temperatures using the M-H curve. However, because the temperature region is very narrow (above 1.8 K) for La compounds, we believe that the estimation of the lower critical field from the M-H curve will not provide accurate results. Hence, we estimated the lower critical field H_{\rm c1}(0) from the thermodynamic field using specific heat measurements.

## V Specific heat

The inset of Fig. 5 shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat C_{p} for La materials in the temperature range of 0.4-4.0 K under a zero and 3 T magnetic field and the same for Sr materials in the temperature range of 0.4-6.0 K under a zero and 5 T magnetic field. The bulk nature of the superconductivity and superior quality of the samples are confirmed by a sharp anomaly at T_{c} = 2.5 and 3.1 K for La_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13} and La_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13}, respectively, and at T_{c} = 4.15 and 4.95 K for Sr_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13} and Sr_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13}, respectively; these values are in good agreement with the values of T_{c} determined using \chi(T).

A standard analysis is conducted under magnetic fields whose values exceed those of the upper critical fields; this analysis yields Sommerfeld constant \gamma and the Debye temperature \Theta_{D}, which is calculated from \beta=N(12/5)\pi^{4}R\Theta_{D}^{-3}, where R = 8.314 J/(K mol) and N = 20. To analyze the specific heat data, we use the expression C_{n}(T) = \gamma T + \beta T^{3} + \delta T^{5}, where \gamma T is the electronic contribution (= C_{e}), \gamma is the electronic specific heat coefficient (Sommerfeld constant), and \beta T^{3} + \delta T^{5} (= C_{p}) is contributed by phonons. However, the specific heat of Sr compounds under a magnetic field shows a fractional drop at a low-temperature region. Although the reason behind the anomaly is not clear (one of the reasons is the existence of rattling), the T^{5} correlation term is certainly inadequate for a system containing an anomaly of phonons such as KOs_{2}O_{6}.[16] To fit the specific heat data, we use an equation with a correction term; this equation is given as C_{n}(T) = \gamma_T_ + \beta T^{3} + \sum_{n=2}^{4}\delta_{2n+1}T^{2n+1}, where the third term is the correction term.[7] The obtained values of \gamma (mJ/K^{2} mol) and \Theta_{D} (K) are 22.2 and 284 for La_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13}, 19.2 and 296 for La_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13}, 31.0 and 252 for Sr_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13}, and 39.3 and 184 for Sr_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13}, respectively.

The solid curve of Fig. 5 represents the fitting result obtained by using the specific heat expression for a conventional superconductor (C_{e}\sim\exp[-\Delta(0)/k_{B}T], where \Delta(0) is the energy gap) below 0.8T_{c}. Under a zero magnetic field, C_{e}(T) behaves as an exponential dependence on temperature at low temperatures. From the exponential dependence curve, the superconducting energy gap \Delta(0) (meV) at T = 0 can be estimated to be 0.505, 0.389 for La_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir) and 0.692, 0.870 for Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir), respectively.

By using these values, we estimated \Delta C_{e}/\gamma T_{c} to be approximately 1.84, 1.64 for La_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir), 1.78, 2.09 for Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir), respectively. These values are relatively larger than those expected from the BCS theory (\Delta C_{e}/\gamma T_{c} = 1.43). Moreover, 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} is calculated to

Figure 3: (Color online) Temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility \chi(T) at 10 Oe in R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir) normalized by the value at 2 K.

  be approximately 3.78, 3.61 for La_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir), and 3.87, 4.08 for Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir), respectively. These values are also larger than those expected from the BCS theory [2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} = 3.54]. From these results, we concluded that all the materials can be categorized as strong-coupling superconductors.

The thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(T) is one of the most important parameters for characterizing the nature of the superconducting ground state, because it is directly related to the condensation energy by the expression \Delta F = \mu_{0}H_{c}^{2}/8\pi. H_{c}(T) is deduced from the specific heat data obtained at H = 0 using the relation

\[\Delta F(T)=F_{n}-F_{s}=\frac{\mu_{0}H_{c}^{2}(T)}{8\pi}=\int_{T_{c}}^{T}dT^{ \prime}\int_{T_{c}}^{T^{\prime}}\frac{C_{e}}{T^{\prime\prime}}dT^{\prime\prime}.\] (1)

The temperature dependence of H_{c}(T) is shown in Fig. 6. As shown in the inset of Fig. 6, H_{c} follows the parabolic form H_{c} =   to T = 0 using the fifth power of the polynomial function of T. For Sr3T4Sn13, the _H_c2(0) value was calculated to be approximately 2.50 and 3.54 T, where T = Rh and Ir, respectively. The _H_c2(0) value was calculated to be 1.02 for La3T4Sn13, where T = Rh, Ir.

Such an enhancement of _H_c2(_T_) on the basis of the WHH prediction has been attributed to several different origins such as the localization effects in highly disordered superconductors,[20] anisotropy of the Fermi surface,[21] and strong electron-phonon coupling.[22,23] When the _e_-ph coupling is in the strong-coupling regime, _H_c2(_T_) starts to deviate from the WHH curve, remains linear as it moves toward lower temperatures, and finally has an upward curvature for a higher _e_-ph coupling. The present heat capacity measurements suggest that the R3_T_4Sn13 (_R_ = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir) belongs to a strong-coupling BCS superconductor with an isotropic _s_-wave pairing symmetry. It is inferred from these results that _H_c2 enhancement cannot be because of the Fermi surface properties, but because of strong coupling. In addition, because these measurements were performed using pure single crystals, the localization effect due to impurity does not enhance the upper critical field.

On the basis of the _H_c2(0) and _H_c(0) values, we estimated the superconducting parameters for R3_T_4Sn13 (_R_ = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir). According to the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory, the GL coherence length \xi(0) and the GL parameter \kappa(0) = \lambda(0)/\xi(0) can be obtained from the upper critical field _H_c2(0), the lower critical field _H_c1(0), and the thermodynamic critical field _H_c(0) using the following equations:

\[H_{c2}(0) = \frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi(0)},\]

\[H_{c1}(0) = \frac{H_{c}^{2}}{H_{c2}(0)}[\ln\kappa(0) + 0.08],\]

\[H_{c}(0) = \frac{H_{c2}(  

## VII Discussion

In the case of _e_-ph coupled superconductors, Carbotte [24] has proposed that the characteristic thermodynamic quantities are computed using empirical formulas that can be described by one adjustable parameter, x = _o_in/_T_c; _o_in is the logarithmic averaged phonon frequency. These formulas are

\[\frac{\Delta C_{e}(T_{c})}{\gamma\,T_{c}} = 1.43\left[ {1 + 53x^{- 2}\ln\frac{x}{3}} \right\rbrack,\] (5) \[\frac{2\Delta(0)}{k_{B}T_{c}} = 3.54\left[ {1 + 12.5x^{- 2}\ln\frac{x}{2}} \right\rbrack,\] (6) \[\frac{\gamma\,T_{c}^{2}}{H_{c}^{2}(0)} = 0.168\left[ {1 - 12.2x^{- 2}\ln\frac{x}{3}} \right\rbrack.\] (7)

This analysis has been successfully applied to various metal-alloy superconductors; [24] to other recently discovered carbon-containing superconductors such as borocarbides, [25, 26] MgCNi_{3}, [27] and La_{2}C_{3}; [28] and to rattling-induced superconductors. [16, 29]

The thermodynamic quantities were estimated by varying x = _o_in/_T_c in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7); they were estimated to be approximately 18.3, 20.2, and 24.7 for La_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13}; 26.3, 40.8, and 19.0 for La_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13}; 19.6, 16.5, and 11.8 for Sr_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13}; and 12.9, 11.9, and 19.0 for Sr_{3}Ir_{4}Sn_{13}, respectively. From the three values of x and _T_c, we obtain mean value of _o_in = 65.3 \pm 5.9, 71.8 \pm 28 K for La_{3}Ta_{3}Ta_{3} (_T_ = Rh, Ir) and _o_in = 66.3 \pm 9.4, 73.0 \pm 11 K for Sr_{3}Ta_{3}Sn_{13} (_T_ = Rh, Ir), respectively. This _o_in value is only 20%\sim40% of the Debye temperature _o_D (200\sim300 K). The Debye frequency is determined only from the phonon DOS profile _F_(_o_), while _o_in results are obtained on the basis of a weighting using the _e_-ph coupling function a2(_o_). Such a reduced values of _o_in as compared to that of _o_D indicates the importance of the low-energy phonon modes for the superconductivity.

The electron-phonon coupling constant (_l_ph) can be estimated using the well-known McMillan formula refined by Allen and Dynes: [24, 30, 31]

\[\lambda_{\rm ph} = \frac{1.04 + \mu^{*}\ln(\omega_{\rm ln}/1.2T_{c})}{(1 - 0.62\mu^{*})\ln(\omega_{\rm ln}/1.2T_{c})-1.04},\] (8)

where \mu^{*} is the Coulomb pseudopotential and is fixed to be 0.10. The obtained values are estimated to be 0.805, 0.647 for La_{3}Ta_{3}Sn_{13} (_T_ = Rh, Ir) and 0.936, 0.983 for Sr_{3}Ta_{3}Sn_{13} (_T_ = Rh, Ir), respectively. Because of the calculated l \sim 1, Sr_{3}Ta_{3}Sn_{13} (_T_ = Rh, Ir) can be categorized as a strong-coupling superconductor; this categorization is in good agreement with the results of specific heat measurements. In the case of La_{3}Ta_{3}Sn_{13}, the calculated values of l are slightly lesser than 1.0, which is indicative of a moderate-coupling

The electronic density of states at the Fermi level, N(E_{F}), is expressed by the following relationship:

\[N(E_{F})=\frac{3\gamma}{\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}(1+\lambda_{\rm ph})}.\] (9)

As shown in the above equation, N(E_{F}) can be derived from the given \gamma and \lambda_{\rm ph}. Using this relationship, we estimated N(E_{F}) [states/(eV f.u.); f.u. denotes formula units] to be approximately 5.22, 4.95 for La_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir) and 6.80, 8.41 for Sr_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (T = Rh, Ir), respectively. As shown in Fig. 9(a), both N(E_{F}) and \lambda_{\rm ph} increase with the transition temperature. The \gamma is increasing with increasing transition temperature, as shown in Fig. 9(b). Therefore, we assume that the difference in both N(E_{F}) and \lambda_{\rm ph} [\gamma_{\rm observed} = (1+\lambda)\gamma_{\rm theoretical}] results in a difference in superconducting transition temperatures.

In the previous report, the N(E_{F}) of La_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13} was obtained from band calculation with the LAPW method.[10] The calculated N(E_{F}) is 5.58 states/(eV f.u.), which is in good agreement with that obtained from the above method. Thus, both the obtained N(E_{F}) and \lambda_{\rm ph} of La_{3}Rh_{4}Sn_{13} are relatively reliable values.

In conclusion, we succeeded in synthesizing single crystals of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} (R = La, Sr; T = Rh, Ir) and analyzed the physical properties of these compounds by measuring their magnetic susceptibility \chi(T), electrical resistivity \rho(T), and magnetization M(H). Specific heat measurements indicated that R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} could be described as a conventional BCS superconductor in the strong-coupling regime. On the basis of the temperature dependence of C_{e} below T_{e}, we conclude that the symmetry of superconductivity of R_{3}T_{4}Sn_{13} corresponds to an isotropic s-wave symmetry.
