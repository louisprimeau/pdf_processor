###### Abstract

We report the ^{121/123}Sb-NMR/nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements on the superconductor BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O with a two-dimensional Ti_{2}O square-net layer formed with Ti^{+} (3d^{1}). NQR measurements revealed that the in-plane four-fold symmetry is broken at the Sb site below T_{\rm A}\sim 40 K, without an internal field appearing at the Sb site. These exclude a spin-density wave (SDW)/charge density wave (CDW) ordering with incommensurate correlations, but can be understood with the commensurate CDW ordering at T_{\rm A}. The spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T_{\rm c}, measured at the four-fold symmetry breaking site, decreases below superconducting (SC) transition temperature T_{\rm c}, indicative of the microscopic coexistence of superconductivity and the CDW/SDW phase below T_{\rm A}. Furthermore, 1/T_{\rm 1} of ^{121}Sb-NQR shows a coherence peak just below T_{\rm c} and decreases exponentially at low temperatures. These results are in sharp contrast with those in cuprate and iron-based superconductors, and strongly suggest that its SC symmetry is classified to an ordinary s-wave state.

## I Introduction

After the discovery of high-T_{\rm c} cuprate superconductors, many efforts have been made to synthesize new high-T_{\rm c} superconductors. These activities have brought us the discovery of various unconventional superconductors, [e.g., Sr_{2}RuO_{4}, [1, 2, 3] NaCoO_{2}:1.5H_{2}O, [4] and LaFeAs(O_{1-x}F_{x}) [5, 6] so far. It is quite interesting that all these superconductors possess a two-dimensional layered structure and are located near the magnetic instability, both of which are regarded as essential ingredients of high-T_{\rm c} superconductors. Actually T_{\rm c} in a quasi-two-dimensional system is theoretically shown to be higher than in a three-dimensional system, since magnetic fluctuation is generally enhanced by low dimensionality. [7]

Quite recently, it was reported that two-dimensional oxyantimonide BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O shows a superconducting (SC) transition at T_{\rm c}\sim 1 K. [8, 9] BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O possesses a similar crystal structure to cuprate La_{2}CuO_{4} and has a Ti_{2}O square net, which is an anticofiguration to the CuO_{2} square net, as shown in Fig. 1. The edge-shared TiO_{2}Sb_{2} octahedra form the square lattice, and the electronic state of Ti^{3+} is in the 3d^{1} state, which is regarded as an electron-hole symmetric state of 3d^{9} state in Cu^{2+}. [8] Thus, BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O is an interesting reference compound of cuprate superconductors although BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O is metallic. From the measurements of magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity, an anomaly was found at 50 K, and the occurrence of a charge density wave (CDW) or spin density wave (SDW) transition was suggested. [8, 9] A similar anomaly was observed in AT_{2}P_{n}_{2}O [A = Na_{2}, Ba, (SrF)_{2}, (SmO)_{2}; Pn = As, Sb] which have almost the same structure as BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O and show no superconductivity, [10, 11, 12] however details of this anomaly have not been investigated. Thus, the understanding of this anomaly, the electronic state of the Ti^{3+} (3d^{1}) and the SC symmetry are important for seeking another way for high-T_{\rm c} superconductivity in the strong correlated 3d electron systems. In order to address the above underlying issues, we performed ^{121/123}Sb-NMR/nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements on BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O.

## II Experimental

BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O was synthesized by the conventional solid state reaction method. [8] NMR measurements are performed in the same batch as magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements. [8] To prevent sample degradation by air and/or moisture, the polycrystalline sample was mixed with stycast 1266, and the mixture was solidified with random crystal orientation. All procedures were done in a glove box filled with N_{2}. T_{\rm c}\simeq 0.95 K of the sample was determined from the diamagnetic shielding signal, which is consistent with the previous report. [8] No reaction was recognized between the sample and stycast, since T_{\rm c} and T_{\rm A} are unchanged during our measurements.

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 2 shows the ^{121/123}Sb-NQR spectra, which were obtained by frequency-swept method at 45 K (>T_{\rm A}) and 4.2 K (<T_{\rm A}). There are two isotopes of Sb nuclei, properties of which are summarized in Table I. When I\geqslant 1, a nucleus has an electric quadrupole moment Q as well as a magnetic dipole moment, and thus the degeneracy of nuclear-energy levels is lifted even at zero magnetic field due to the interaction between Q and the electric field gradient (EFG). This interaction is described as

\[{\cal H}_{Q}=\frac{v_{zz}}{6}\left\{\left(3I_{z}^{2}-I^{2}\right)+\frac{1}{2} \eta(I_{+}^{2}+I_{-}^{2})\right\}\,,\] (1)

where v_{zz} is the quadrupole frequency along the principal axis (c axis) of the EFG, and is defined as v_{zz}\equiv 3e^{2}q\,Q/2I(2I-1) with eq=V_{zz}, and \eta is an asymmetry parameter of the EFG expressed as (V_{xx}-V_{yy})/V_{zz}, with V_{aa}, which is the EFG along the \alpha direction (\alpha=x,y,z,). When ^{121}Sb (^{223}Sb) is in the presence of the EFG, the degenerate six (eight) nuclear-spin states are split three (four) energy levels, yielding two (three) resonance frequencies as shown in Fig. 2. The quadrupole parameters v_{zz} and \eta for each Sb nuclei are estimated from the comparison between the observed  ^{121/125}Sb-NQR spectra and calculated resonance frequencies obtained from the diagonalization of Eq. (1) as shown in Fig. 2. Field-swept NMR spectra can be consistently fit by the simulation calculated with the same quadrupole parameters as shown in Fig. 4, indicative of the validity of the NQR analysis.

Reflecting the four-fold symmetry of the crystal structure, \eta is zero at 45 K, while the NQR spectrum is gradually shifted below 40 K. T dependence of the resonance frequencies arising from the \pm 1/2\leftrightarrow\pm 3/2 (v_{1}) and \pm 3/2\leftrightarrow\pm 5/2 (v_{2}) transition of ^{123}Sb is shown in Fig. 3(a). In the case of I=7/2, NQR frequencies from each transition can be described as

\[v_{1}=v_{zz}\left(1+\frac{109}{30}\eta^{2}\right),\quad\text{and}\quad v_{2}= 2v_{zz}\left(1-\frac{17}{30}\eta^{2}\right)\]

within the second-order perturbation of \eta in \mathcal{H}_{Q}. Above 40 K, the experimental result shows the relation v_{2}/v_{1}\simeq 2(1-\frac{21}{3}\eta^{2})\simeq 2 within the experimental error, but at 4.2 K, the result shows v_{2}/v_{1}\simeq 1.9, which is evidence of finite \eta. From the above resonance frequencies, we derived T variation of \eta and v_{zz}, which is shown in Fig. 3(b) and the inset, respectively. The T dependence of v_{zz} is consistent with that in the lattice parameters,[8] indicative of the validity of the estimation. The spectra below T_{\text{A}} can be interpreted by the change of v_{zz} and the finite \eta without an internal field appearing at the Sb site. This indicates the breaking of the in-plane four-fold symmetry at the Sb site at low temperatures. The \eta changes continuously below 40 K and no clear hysteresis is observed, showing the transition at T_{\text{A}} to be second order.

Next, we focus on the T dependence of low-energy spin dynamics probed with 1/T_{1} measurements at the Sb site. Figure 5 shows the T dependence of 1/T_{1}T of ^{121/125}Sb-NQR in BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O. Values of T_{1} were derived by fitting the recovery data of R(t)=1-m(t)/m(\infty) to the theoretical NQR recovery curves of I=5/2 and 7/2. Here m(t) is the time dependence of spin-echo intensity at the peak of the NQR spectrum after saturation of nuclear magnetization, and R(t) in the whole measurement range could be fit with a single component of T_{1}. 1/T_{1}T= const. (so-called "Korringa") behavior was observed above \sim50 K, suggestive of the Fermi liquid (FL) state. Upon cooling, 1/T_{1}T starts to increase at 50 K, where the resistivity shows a kink, and exhibits a peak at around 40 K, followed by the FL state again upon further cooling. The constant value of 1/T_{1}T in a T range between 1.5 K and 10 K is \sim1.1 \pm 0.03, which is \sim83% of 1/T_{1}T value above 50 K, indicative of the decrease of N(E_{F}) by 9% below T_{\text{A}}, since 1/T_{1}T in the FL state is proportional to the square of the density of states (DOS) around the Fermi energy N(E_{F}).

To investigate the origin of the phase transition, we measured 1/T_{1}T at two Sb isotopes and estimate 1/T_{1} ratio between the ^{121/123}Sb isotopes (^{121}T_{1}^{-1}/^{123}T_{1}^{-1}) as shown in the

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}  & \gamma_{\mu}/2\pi (MHz/T) & Q (10^{-24} cm^{2}) & N.A. (\%) & I \\ ^{121}Sb & 10.189 & -0.2\sim-1.8 & 57.3 & 5/2 \\ ^{125}Sb & 5.5175 & -0.2\sim-0.7 & 42.7 & 7/2 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}

From the observed ^{121/125}Sb-NQR spectra, the quadrupole parameters for the Sb nuclei were evaluated as shown in the figure. The broken curves are the simulation of NQR spectra using the estimated quadrupole parameters. The asymmetry parameter \eta becomes finite at 4.2 K, indicative of the in-plane four-fold symmetry breaking at the Sb site. Linewidths of NQR spectra can be explained by only the electric field gradient distribution, indicative of the absence of internal magnetic field at the Sb site.

  inset of Fig. 5. In general, an NMR/NQR spin lattice relaxation occurs through magnetic and/or electric-quadrupole channels. In the case of magnetic channel, fluctuations of local magnetic fields at a nuclear site cause magnetic relaxations between the nuclear spin levels of \Delta m=\pm 1. The magnetic relaxation rate is related to the gyromagnetic ratio \gamma_{n} by T_{1M}^{-1}\propto\gamma_{n}^{2}. Therefore,

\[\frac{^{121}T_{1M}^{-1}}{^{123}T_{1M}^{-1}}=\left(\frac{10.189}{5.5175} \right)^{2}=3.41\]

is estimated from Table 1.

On the other hand, fluctuations of EFG cause electric quadrupole relaxation between the nuclear spin levels of \Delta m=\pm 1 and \Delta m=\pm 2. In this case, the electric-quadrupole relaxation rate is related to the quadrupole moment Q by T_{1Q}^{-1}\propto 3(2I+3)Q^{2}/[10(2I-1)I^{2}].[13] From obtained v_{zz}\equiv 3e^{2}q\,Q/2I(2I-1), the ratio of ^{121}Q/^{123}Q can be estimated as

\[\frac{^{121}Q}{^{123}Q}=\frac{\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{7}{2}}(2\cdot\frac{5}{2}- 1)\cdot^{121}v_{xz}\simeq 0.80.\]

Then,

\[\frac{^{121}T_{1Q}^{-1}}{^{123}T_{1Q}^{-1}}

  the ^{121/123}Sb-NMR/NQR spectra at low temperatures revealed that the in-plane four-fold symmetry is broken at the Sb site below T_{\rm A}\sim 40 K without the internal field appearing at the Sb site. The absence of an internal field excludes the SDW ordering with an incommensurate correlation, since otherwise internal fields should appear at the Sb site, resulting in resonance peaks, particularly those arising from the transition between m=\pm 1/2 and \pm 3/2, that are split or broadened.

Alternatively, the change of the NQR spectra below T_{\rm A} can be understood by the occurrence of the commensurate CDW ordering. When a CDW transition occurs, there appear several Ti sites with different charge densities in most cases. However, the shift of the ^{121/123}Sb NQR peak without splitting nor appreciable broadening below T_{\rm A} gives a strong constraint and indicates that charge densities at the Ti sites should have a commensurate correlation, since there would be several Sb sites induced below T_{\rm A} if a CDW ordering possesses an incommensurate correlation. The different charge densities at the Ti sites, e.g., the Ti configuration shown in Fig. 3(b), break the in-plane four-fold symmetry at the Sb site although a tetragonality is maintained below T_{\rm A}. The charge difference at the Ti site is considered to be small since the change of the DOS probed with 1/T_{1}T and the kink of the resistivity are very small below T_{\rm A}. However, the possibility of the magnetic ordering together with the CDW ordering at T_{\rm A} would not be ruled out, since we cannot exclude commensurate magnetic ordering with a specific relationship between magnetic correlations and ordered moment direction [e.g., internal fields are canceled out at the Sb site when magnetic correlations are checkerboard (\pi,\pi) and ordered moments direct to the c axis, even if the off-diagonal hyperfine fields are taken into account [15; 16]. To exclude the possibility of magnetic ordering, NMR/NQR measurements at the Ti site and/or neutron scattering measurements are crucial. It should be noted that magnetic fluctuations are enhanced toward T_{\rm A}. In a well-known 2H-NbSe_{2}, where superconductivity (T_{\rm c}\sim 7 K) occurs below the CDW transition at T_{\rm CDW}\sim 35 K, no anomaly was observed in 1/T_{1} at T_{\rm CDW}, [17] however the similar anomaly of 1/T_{1} as in BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O was observed in Lu_{3}Ir_{3}Si_{10} at T_{\rm CDW}. [18] Since the relationship between charge and magnetic degree of freedom has not been well understood, BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O might be one of the suitable systems to investigate a correlation between charge and spin dynamics.

Next, we discuss the 1/T_{1} in the SC state. 1/T_{1} of ^{121}Sb-NQR slightly decreases below 1.5 K, where a small Meissner signal appears, but 1/T_{1} shows a tiny coherence peak just below T_{\rm c}\simeq 0.95 K, where the sharp Meissner signal is observed, and then rapidly decreases at low temperatures as shown in Fig. 6. T dependence of 1/T_{1} far below T_{\rm c} is much steeper than T^{3} dependence, but T_{1} follows an exponential T dependence down to 0.3 K, as shown by an Arrhenius plot in the inset of (b). These are in sharp contrast with T dependence in cuprate [19] and iron-based superconductors. [6] From the slope of the plot, the magnitude of the SC gap is estimated to be 2\Delta/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=4.4, and actually the observed 1/T_{1} in the SC state can be fit consistently by an s-wave full gap model with 2\Delta/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=4.4 and \delta/\Delta=0.5, where \delta is the broadening parameter of the singularity in the SC DOS. Absence of the residual DOS in the SC state is also consistent with an s-wave model, since residual DOS suggested by the Korringa behavior far below T_{\rm c} is easily introduced by disorder and/or a tiny amount of impurities in unconventional superconductors. [20; 21] Since the present NQR measurements were done in an "early-stage" polycrystalline sample, the full-gap s-wave state would be the most possible SC gap state in BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O.

## IV Summary

In summary, the NQR asymmetric parameter \eta becomes finite below T_{\rm A}\simeq 40 K, indicative of the breaking of the in-plane four-fold symmetry at the Sb site without an internal field appearing at the Sb site. The variation of the NQR spectra below T_{\rm A} can be understood by the occurrence of the commensurate CDW transition. 1/T_{1} below T_{\rm A} shows a further anomaly below T_{\rm c} due to the opening of the SC gap, indicative of the coexistence of superconductivity and the anomaly occurring at T_{\rm A}. In the SC state, 1/T_{1} shows a coherence peak just below T_{\rm c} and exponentially decreases at low temperatures, which strongly suggests that the SC symmetry of BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O is an s wave with finite SC gap.

###### Abstract

We report the ^{121/123}Sb-NMR/nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements on the superconductor BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O with a two-dimensional Ti_{2}O square-net layer formed with Ti^{+} (3d^{1}). NQR measurements revealed that the in-plane four-fold symmetry is broken at the Sb site below T_{\rm A}\sim 40 K, without an internal field appearing at the Sb site. These exclude a spin-density wave (SDW)/charge density wave (CDW) ordering with incommensurate correlations, but can be understood with the commensurate CDW ordering at T_{\rm A}. The spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T_{\rm c}, measured at the four-fold symmetry breaking site, decreases below superconducting (SC) transition temperature T_{\rm c}, indicative of the microscopic coexistence of superconductivity and the CDW/SDW phase below T_{\rm A}. Furthermore, 1/T_{\rm 1} of ^{121}Sb-NQR shows a coherence peak just below T_{\rm c} and decreases exponentially at low temperatures. These results are in sharp contrast with those in cuprate and iron-based superconductors, and strongly suggest that its SC symmetry is classified to an ordinary s-wave state.

## I Introduction

After the discovery of high-T_{\rm c} cuprate superconductors, many efforts have been made to synthesize new high-T_{\rm c} superconductors. These activities have brought us the discovery of various unconventional superconductors, [e.g., Sr_{2}RuO_{4}, [1, 2, 3] NaCoO_{2}:1.5H_{2}O, [4] and LaFeAs(O_{1-x}F_{x}) [5, 6] so far. It is quite interesting that all these superconductors possess a two-dimensional layered structure and are located near the magnetic instability, both of which are regarded as essential ingredients of high-T_{\rm c} superconductors. Actually T_{\rm c} in a quasi-two-dimensional system is theoretically shown to be higher than in a three-dimensional system, since magnetic fluctuation is generally enhanced by low dimensionality. [7]

Quite recently, it was reported that two-dimensional oxyantimonide BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O shows a superconducting (SC) transition at T_{\rm c}\sim 1 K. [8, 9] BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O possesses a similar crystal structure to cuprate La_{2}CuO_{4} and has a Ti_{2}O square net, which is an anticofiguration to the CuO_{2} square net, as shown in Fig. 1. The edge-shared TiO_{2}Sb_{2} octahedra form the square lattice, and the electronic state of Ti^{3+} is in the 3d^{1} state, which is regarded as an electron-hole symmetric state of 3d^{9} state in Cu^{2+}. [8] Thus, BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O is an interesting reference compound of cuprate superconductors although BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O is metallic. From the measurements of magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity, an anomaly was found at 50 K, and the occurrence of a charge density wave (CDW) or spin density wave (SDW) transition was suggested. [8, 9] A similar anomaly was observed in AT_{2}P_{n}_{2}O [A = Na_{2}, Ba, (SrF)_{2}, (SmO)_{2}; Pn = As, Sb] which have almost the same structure as BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O and show no superconductivity, [10, 11, 12] however details of this anomaly have not been investigated. Thus, the understanding of this anomaly, the electronic state of the Ti^{3+} (3d^{1}) and the SC symmetry are important for seeking another way for high-T_{\rm c} superconductivity in the strong correlated 3d electron systems. In order to address the above underlying issues, we performed ^{121/123}Sb-NMR/nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements on BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O.

## II Experimental

BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O was synthesized by the conventional solid state reaction method. [8] NMR measurements are performed in the same batch as magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements. [8] To prevent sample degradation by air and/or moisture, the polycrystalline sample was mixed with stycast 1266, and the mixture was solidified with random crystal orientation. All procedures were done in a glove box filled with N_{2}. T_{\rm c}\simeq 0.95 K of the sample was determined from the diamagnetic shielding signal, which is consistent with the previous report. [8] No reaction was recognized between the sample and stycast, since T_{\rm c} and T_{\rm A} are unchanged during our measurements.

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 2 shows the ^{121/123}Sb-NQR spectra, which were obtained by frequency-swept method at 45 K (>T_{\rm A}) and 4.2 K (<T_{\rm A}). There are two isotopes of Sb nuclei, properties of which are summarized in Table I. When I\geqslant 1, a nucleus has an electric quadrupole moment Q as well as a magnetic dipole moment, and thus the degeneracy of nuclear-energy levels is lifted even at zero magnetic field due to the interaction between Q and the electric field gradient (EFG). This interaction is described as

\[{\cal H}_{Q}=\frac{v_{zz}}{6}\left\{\left(3I_{z}^{2}-I^{2}\right)+\frac{1}{2} \eta(I_{+}^{2}+I_{-}^{2})\right\}\,,\] (1)

where v_{zz} is the quadrupole frequency along the principal axis (c axis) of the EFG, and is defined as v_{zz}\equiv 3e^{2}q\,Q/2I(2I-1) with eq=V_{zz}, and \eta is an asymmetry parameter of the EFG expressed as (V_{xx}-V_{yy})/V_{zz}, with V_{aa}, which is the EFG along the \alpha direction (\alpha=x,y,z,). When ^{121}Sb (^{223}Sb) is in the presence of the EFG, the degenerate six (eight) nuclear-spin states are split three (four) energy levels, yielding two (three) resonance frequencies as shown in Fig. 2. The quadrupole parameters v_{zz} and \eta for each Sb nuclei are estimated from the comparison between the observed  ^{121/125}Sb-NQR spectra and calculated resonance frequencies obtained from the diagonalization of Eq. (1) as shown in Fig. 2. Field-swept NMR spectra can be consistently fit by the simulation calculated with the same quadrupole parameters as shown in Fig. 4, indicative of the validity of the NQR analysis.

Reflecting the four-fold symmetry of the crystal structure, \eta is zero at 45 K, while the NQR spectrum is gradually shifted below 40 K. T dependence of the resonance frequencies arising from the \pm 1/2\leftrightarrow\pm 3/2 (v_{1}) and \pm 3/2\leftrightarrow\pm 5/2 (v_{2}) transition of ^{123}Sb is shown in Fig. 3(a). In the case of I=7/2, NQR frequencies from each transition can be described as

\[v_{1}=v_{zz}\left(1+\frac{109}{30}\eta^{2}\right),\quad\text{and}\quad v_{2}= 2v_{zz}\left(1-\frac{17}{30}\eta^{2}\right)\]

within the second-order perturbation of \eta in \mathcal{H}_{Q}. Above 40 K, the experimental result shows the relation v_{2}/v_{1}\simeq 2(1-\frac{21}{3}\eta^{2})\simeq 2 within the experimental error, but at 4.2 K, the result shows v_{2}/v_{1}\simeq 1.9, which is evidence of finite \eta. From the above resonance frequencies, we derived T variation of \eta and v_{zz}, which is shown in Fig. 3(b) and the inset, respectively. The T dependence of v_{zz} is consistent with that in the lattice parameters,[8] indicative of the validity of the estimation. The spectra below T_{\text{A}} can be interpreted by the change of v_{zz} and the finite \eta without an internal field appearing at the Sb site. This indicates the breaking of the in-plane four-fold symmetry at the Sb site at low temperatures. The \eta changes continuously below 40 K and no clear hysteresis is observed, showing the transition at T_{\text{A}} to be second order.

Next, we focus on the T dependence of low-energy spin dynamics probed with 1/T_{1} measurements at the Sb site. Figure 5 shows the T dependence of 1/T_{1}T of ^{121/125}Sb-NQR in BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O. Values of T_{1} were derived by fitting the recovery data of R(t)=1-m(t)/m(\infty) to the theoretical NQR recovery curves of I=5/2 and 7/2. Here m(t) is the time dependence of spin-echo intensity at the peak of the NQR spectrum after saturation of nuclear magnetization, and R(t) in the whole measurement range could be fit with a single component of T_{1}. 1/T_{1}T= const. (so-called "Korringa") behavior was observed above \sim50 K, suggestive of the Fermi liquid (FL) state. Upon cooling, 1/T_{1}T starts to increase at 50 K, where the resistivity shows a kink, and exhibits a peak at around 40 K, followed by the FL state again upon further cooling. The constant value of 1/T_{1}T in a T range between 1.5 K and 10 K is \sim1.1 \pm 0.03, which is \sim83% of 1/T_{1}T value above 50 K, indicative of the decrease of N(E_{F}) by 9% below T_{\text{A}}, since 1/T_{1}T in the FL state is proportional to the square of the density of states (DOS) around the Fermi energy N(E_{F}).

To investigate the origin of the phase transition, we measured 1/T_{1}T at two Sb isotopes and estimate 1/T_{1} ratio between the ^{121/123}Sb isotopes (^{121}T_{1}^{-1}/^{123}T_{1}^{-1}) as shown in the

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}  & \gamma_{\mu}/2\pi (MHz/T) & Q (10^{-24} cm^{2}) & N.A. (\%) & I \\ ^{121}Sb & 10.189 & -0.2\sim-1.8 & 57.3 & 5/2 \\ ^{125}Sb & 5.5175 & -0.2\sim-0.7 & 42.7 & 7/2 \\ \end{tabular}

From the observed ^{121/125}Sb-NQR spectra, the quadrupole parameters for the Sb nuclei were evaluated as shown in the figure. The broken curves are the simulation of NQR spectra using the estimated quadrupole parameters. The asymmetry parameter \eta becomes finite at 4.2 K, indicative of the in-plane four-fold symmetry breaking at the Sb site. Linewidths of NQR spectra can be explained by only the electric field gradient distribution, indicative of the absence of internal magnetic field at the Sb site.

  inset of Fig. 5. In general, an NMR/NQR spin lattice relaxation occurs through magnetic and/or electric-quadrupole channels. In the case of magnetic channel, fluctuations of local magnetic fields at a nuclear site cause magnetic relaxations between the nuclear spin levels of \Delta m=\pm 1. The magnetic relaxation rate is related to the gyromagnetic ratio \gamma_{n} by T_{1M}^{-1}\propto\gamma_{n}^{2}. Therefore,

\[\frac{^{121}T_{1M}^{-1}}{^{123}T_{1M}^{-1}}=\left(\frac{10.189}{5.5175} \right)^{2}=3.41\]

is estimated from Table 1.

On the other hand, fluctuations of EFG cause electric quadrupole relaxation between the nuclear spin levels of \Delta m=\pm 1 and \Delta m=\pm 2. In this case, the electric-quadrupole relaxation rate is related to the quadrupole moment Q by T_{1Q}^{-1}\propto 3(2I+3)Q^{2}/[10(2I-1)I^{2}].[13] From obtained v_{zz}\equiv 3e^{2}q\,Q/2I(2I-1), the ratio of ^{121}Q/^{123}Q can be estimated as

\[\frac{^{121}Q}{^{123}Q}=\frac{\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{7}{2}}(2\cdot\frac{5}{2}- 1)\cdot^{121}v_{xz}\simeq 0.80.\]

Then,

\[\frac{^{121}T_{1Q}^{-1}}{^{123}T_{1Q}^{-1}}

  the ^{121/123}Sb-NMR/NQR spectra at low temperatures revealed that the in-plane four-fold symmetry is broken at the Sb site below T_{\rm A}\sim 40 K without the internal field appearing at the Sb site. The absence of an internal field excludes the SDW ordering with an incommensurate correlation, since otherwise internal fields should appear at the Sb site, resulting in resonance peaks, particularly those arising from the transition between m=\pm 1/2 and \pm 3/2, that are split or broadened.

Alternatively, the change of the NQR spectra below T_{\rm A} can be understood by the occurrence of the commensurate CDW ordering. When a CDW transition occurs, there appear several Ti sites with different charge densities in most cases. However, the shift of the ^{121/123}Sb NQR peak without splitting nor appreciable broadening below T_{\rm A} gives a strong constraint and indicates that charge densities at the Ti sites should have a commensurate correlation, since there would be several Sb sites induced below T_{\rm A} if a CDW ordering possesses an incommensurate correlation. The different charge densities at the Ti sites, e.g., the Ti configuration shown in Fig. 3(b), break the in-plane four-fold symmetry at the Sb site although a tetragonality is maintained below T_{\rm A}. The charge difference at the Ti site is considered to be small since the change of the DOS probed with 1/T_{1}T and the kink of the resistivity are very small below T_{\rm A}. However, the possibility of the magnetic ordering together with the CDW ordering at T_{\rm A} would not be ruled out, since we cannot exclude commensurate magnetic ordering with a specific relationship between magnetic correlations and ordered moment direction [e.g., internal fields are canceled out at the Sb site when magnetic correlations are checkerboard (\pi,\pi) and ordered moments direct to the c axis, even if the off-diagonal hyperfine fields are taken into account [15; 16]. To exclude the possibility of magnetic ordering, NMR/NQR measurements at the Ti site and/or neutron scattering measurements are crucial. It should be noted that magnetic fluctuations are enhanced toward T_{\rm A}. In a well-known 2H-NbSe_{2}, where superconductivity (T_{\rm c}\sim 7 K) occurs below the CDW transition at T_{\rm CDW}\sim 35 K, no anomaly was observed in 1/T_{1} at T_{\rm CDW}, [17] however the similar anomaly of 1/T_{1} as in BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O was observed in Lu_{3}Ir_{3}Si_{10} at T_{\rm CDW}. [18] Since the relationship between charge and magnetic degree of freedom has not been well understood, BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O might be one of the suitable systems to investigate a correlation between charge and spin dynamics.

Next, we discuss the 1/T_{1} in the SC state. 1/T_{1} of ^{121}Sb-NQR slightly decreases below 1.5 K, where a small Meissner signal appears, but 1/T_{1} shows a tiny coherence peak just below T_{\rm c}\simeq 0.95 K, where the sharp Meissner signal is observed, and then rapidly decreases at low temperatures as shown in Fig. 6. T dependence of 1/T_{1} far below T_{\rm c} is much steeper than T^{3} dependence, but T_{1} follows an exponential T dependence down to 0.3 K, as shown by an Arrhenius plot in the inset of (b). These are in sharp contrast with T dependence in cuprate [19] and iron-based superconductors. [6] From the slope of the plot, the magnitude of the SC gap is estimated to be 2\Delta/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=4.4, and actually the observed 1/T_{1} in the SC state can be fit consistently by an s-wave full gap model with 2\Delta/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=4.4 and \delta/\Delta=0.5, where \delta is the broadening parameter of the singularity in the SC DOS. Absence of the residual DOS in the SC state is also consistent with an s-wave model, since residual DOS suggested by the Korringa behavior far below T_{\rm c} is easily introduced by disorder and/or a tiny amount of impurities in unconventional superconductors. [20; 21] Since the present NQR measurements were done in an "early-stage" polycrystalline sample, the full-gap s-wave state would be the most possible SC gap state in BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O.

## IV Summary

In summary, the NQR asymmetric parameter \eta becomes finite below T_{\rm A}\simeq 40 K, indicative of the breaking of the in-plane four-fold symmetry at the Sb site without an internal field appearing at the Sb site. The variation of the NQR spectra below T_{\rm A} can be understood by the occurrence of the commensurate CDW transition. 1/T_{1} below T_{\rm A} shows a further anomaly below T_{\rm c} due to the opening of the SC gap, indicative of the coexistence of superconductivity and the anomaly occurring at T_{\rm A}. In the SC state, 1/T_{1} shows a coherence peak just below T_{\rm c} and exponentially decreases at low temperatures, which strongly suggests that the SC symmetry of BaTi_{2}Sb_{2}O is an s wave with finite SC gap.

Figure 6: (Color online) T dependence of 1/T_{1} measured at 8.0 MHz. The inset of (a) shows the T dependence of 1/T_{1}T and a diamagnetic shielding signal measured by an NMR coil around T_{\rm c}, and the inset of (b) shows the Arrhenius plot of T_{\rm A}. As seen in the insets of (a) and (b), 1/T_{1} shows a coherence peak just below T_{\rm c}\simeq 0.95 K and rapidly decreases at low temperatures. The red curves are a calculation of T dependence of 1/T_{1} based on an s-wave model with a finite gap. In the s-wave model, 2\Delta/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=4.4 and \delta/\Delta=0.5 are adopted, where \delta/\Delta are the broadening parameter of the SC gap. 1/T_{1} results in the SC state are consistently reproduced with the s-wave model.
