###### Abstract

We have investigated uniaxial pressure effect on superconductivity of _pure_ Sr2RuO4, whose intrinsic superconducting transition temperature _T_c is 1.5 K. It is revealed that a very low uniaxial pressure along the \(c\) axis, only 0.2 GPa, induces superconductivity with the onset _T_c above 3 K. The present results indicate that pure Sr2RuO4 has two superconducting phases with _T_c=1.5 K and with varying _T_c up to 3.2 K. The latter phase exhibits unusual features and is attributable to anisotropic crystal distortions beyond the elastic limit.

The application of uniaxial pressure (UP) can be a powerful tool to control superconductivity (SC) as well as the electronic structure through anisotropic distortions in the crystal lattice. [1, 2, 3, 4] The layered perovskite ruthenate Sr2RuO4, for which convincing evidence has been accumulated in favor of spin-triplet SC, [5, 6] has an undistorted tetragonal structure. It has been experimentally and theoretically revealed that the electronic states of Sr2RuO4 and its related materials are expected to drastically change with an anisotropic distortion. [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] Thus, Sr2RuO4 is one of the materials expected to have a prominent UP effect on its SC.

The intrinsic superconducting transition temperature _T_c of Sr2RuO4 was revealed to be 1.5 K for crystals with the best quality. [6] Hydrostatic pressure, [14, 15] as well as a small amount of impurities or defects, [16, 17] is known to suppress _T_c. In contrast, the enhancement of _T_c was reported in the Sr2RuO4-Ru eutectic system (the onset _T_c ~ 3 - 3.5 K) (Refs. [18, 19, 20]) and a submicron Sr2RuO4 single crystal (the onset _T_c ~ 1.8 K). [21] At present, the mechanisms of the enhancement of _T_c remain unresolved. In the eutectic system, lamellae of Ru metal (_T_c = 0.49 K) with approximate dimensions of 10 x 10 x 1 \(\times\) 1 \(\mu\)m\({}^{3}\) are embedded with a stripe pattern. It has been established that the 3-K SC with a tiny volume fraction occurs in the Sr2RuO4 region in the vicinity of the Sr2RuO4-Ru interface. [22, 23] One possible scenario is that anisotropic distortions in Sr2RuO4, e.g., induced by the presence of Ru, enhance its _T_c significantly. [19]

Although UP experiments on Sr2RuO4 have not been reported, the change in _T_c with UP along the interlayer \(c\) and in-plane \(a\) axis, _P_ik and _P_ik, in the elastic limit was predicted from the ultrasonic experiments combined with the Ehrenf relations. [24]\((1/T_{c})(dT_{c}/dP_{\text{ik}}) = (0 \cdot \pm 0.2)\) GPa\({}^{- 1}\) and \((1/T_{c})(dT_{c}/dP_{\text{ik}}) = - (0 \cdot 85 \cdot 0.05)\) GPa\({}^{- 1}\). Qualitatively the same UP effects were theoretically predicted based on the change in the density of states at the Fermi level in the band mainly responsible for the SC. [25] On the basis of these predictions, _T_c is expected to increase under _P_ik.

Recently, the UP effects on interfacial 3-K SC in the eutectic system have been investigated. [26, 27] It was revealed that the volume fraction of the 3-K SC drastically increases by the application of UP in _any_ directions while its onset _T_c is almost invariant. These findings urge the UP effect on _pure_ Sr2RuO4 to be investigated as well.

In this Rapid Communication, we report the effect of _P_ik on pure Sr2RuO4. We reveal that the onset _T_c of pure Sr2RuO4 is immediately enhanced to 3.2 K by _P_ik of only 0.2 GPa. By comparing the effects of _P_ik between pure Sr2RuO4 and Sr2RuO4-Ru eutectic crystals, it is revealed that the higher-_T_c SC in the pure Sr2RuO4 sample is not induced by the development of interfacial 3-K SC originating from a tiny amount of Ru inclusions but is indeed an intrinsic property of pure Sr2RuO4.

Single crystals used in this study were grown by a floating zone method with Ru self-flux. [28] Because RuO2 evaporates from the surface of melt during the growth, excess Ru tends to be left in the center of the melt. Therefore, most of single crystalline rods with the best _T_c (no defect at the Ru site) contain Sr2RuO4-Ru eutectic solidification in its core region and pure Sr2RuO4 only around the thin surface part. [19] This feature, as well as the tendency to cleave easily, makes it difficult to obtain a large crystal which only contains Sr2RuO4. In particular, it is extremely difficult to prepare a pure sample suitable for the application of _P_ik. For the application of _P_ik, we have succeeded in preparing one large sample of practically pure Sr2RuO4 with almost no Ru inclusions (sample 1) from a crystalline rod with relatively lower _T_c (small amount of defects at the Ru site). The dimensions of sample 1 are 1.5 x 1.4 mm\({}^{2}\) in the _ab_ plane and 0.22 mm along the \(c\) axis. In order to reduce the amount of lattice defects and oxygen deficiencies as well as the number of Ru inclusions, sample 1 was annealed in oxygen at 1 atm and 1050 \({}^{\circ}\)C for a week. Then, sample 1 exhibits a very sharp transition at 1.34 K, as determined from the ac susceptibility.

In addition to sample 1, two Sr2RuO4 samples containing a small amount of Ru inclusions and five Sr2RuO4-Ru eutectic samples have been used to investigate the _P_ik effect. Repeating those samples samples, magnetic susceptibility results for a Sr2RuO4 sample with a small amount of Ru inclusions (sample 2) and a Sr2RuO4-Ru eutectic sample (sample 3) are compared with the results for sample 1 in this Rapid Communication. The approximate dimensions of samples 2 and 3 were 1.5 x 1.5 mm\({}^{2}\) in the _ab_ plane and 0.3 mm along the \(c\) axis. The amount of Ru inclusions was identified from the polarized-light optical microscope images of the _ab_ surfaces, as exemplified in Figs. 1(a)-1(c). The number density of Ru inclusions on the _ab_ surfaces for sample 1 is less than 3 mm\({}^{- 2}\) and about 40 mm\({}^{- 2}\) after and before annealing, respectively while the number densities are about 200 mm\({}^{- 2}\) for sample 2 and about 4000 mm\({}^{- 2}\) for sample 3.

UP was applied parallel to the shortest dimension along the \(c\) axis using a piston-cylinder-type pressure cell made of Cu-Be alloy with a cylindrical outer body made of hard plastic (polybenzimidazole). The room-temperature pressure value was confirmed to be in a reasonable agreement with low-temperature pressure value determined by superconducting transitions of tin and lead.[29] The side surfaces of the samples were covered with thin epoxy (Emerson-Cuming, Stycast 1266) to prevent a breakdown of the sample, as described in Ref. [26]. The magnetization was measured down to 1.8 K with an applied dc magnetic field \(\mu_{0}H_{\text{dc}}\) of 2 mT using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (Quantum Design, model MPMS). The background magnetization of the pressure cell was subtracted. The ac susceptibility \(\chi_{\text{ac}}\)=\(X^{\prime}-iX^{\prime\prime}\) was measured down to 0.3 K by a mutual-inductance technique using a lock-in amplifier (LIA) with a \({}^{3}\)He cryostat (Oxford Instruments, model Heliox V). All \(\chi_{\text{ac}}\) data presented here were taken at 293 Hz. The values of \(\chi_{\text{ac}}\) were obtained from the relation \(\chi_{\text{ac}}\)=\(iC_{1}V_{\text{LIA}}/H_{\text{ac}}\) + \(C_{2}\), where \(V_{\text{LIA}}\)=(\(V_{+}iV_{y}\)) is the read-out voltage of LIA and \(H_{\text{ac}}\) is the magnitude of the applied ac magnetic field. The values of \(C_{1}\) and \(C_{2}\) were chosen so that \(\chi^{\prime}\)(4 K) = 0 and \(\chi^{\prime}\)(0.3 K) = 1 at 0 GPa for each sample; thus \(|\chi^{\prime}|\) corresponds to the ac shielding fraction. For the \(\chi_{\text{ac}}\) curves under \(P_{\text{lc}}\), \(C_{1}\) and \(C_{2}\) determined at 0 GPa were used.

Figure 2(a) represents the temperature dependence of the superconducting dc susceptibility \(\Delta\chi_{\text{dc}}\)=\(\Delta m/\mu_{0}H_{\text{dc}}\) for each sample at 0 GPa, where \(\Delta m\) is the observed magnetization change associated with the superconducting transition divided by the sample volume. Here, the ideal value for the full Meissner state without the demagnetization correction corresponds to \(\Delta\chi_{\text{dc}}\)=\(-\)1; thus \(|\Delta\chi_{\text{dc}}|\) is equal to the dc shielding fraction. At 0 GPa, there is no sign of a dc shielding signal for sample 1 above 1.8 K, confirming that it does not contain any eutectic part. A weak shielding signal with the onset \(T_{c}\) slightly above 3 K was observed in samples 2 and 3, consistent with the recent study.[20] At 0 GPa, the dc shielding fraction at 1.8 K is clearly larger in sample 3, containing more Ru inclusions.

Surprisingly, even at relatively low \(P_{\text{lc}}\) of 0.2 GPa, SC with the onset \(T_{c}\) of 3.2 K, at which \(\Delta\chi_{\text{dc}}\) deviates from zero [see Fig. 2(c)], is induced in sample 1. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the shielding fraction in the field-cooling (FC) process is nearly half of that in the zero-field-cooling (ZFC) process at \(P_{\text{lc}}\)=0.3 GPa. The relatively large FC shielding fraction indicates that the screening area does not contain normal-state regions largely. Figure 2(d) demonstrates the variation in the dc shielding fraction at 1.8 K, \(|\Delta\chi_{\text{dc}}\)(1.8 K)|, under \(P_{\text{lc}}\) for each sample. Unexpectedly, as the amount of Ru inclusions is _larger_, the enhancement of the shielding fraction by \(P_{\text{lc}}\) becomes _smaller_; the order of increasing shielding fractions among different samples is reversed between Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). Below 0.3 GPa, the slope of \(|\Delta\chi_{\text{dc}}\)(1.8 K)| versus \(P_{\text{lc}}\) for sample 1 is much greater than those for samples 2 and 3. These results strongly indicate that the presence of Ru inclusions does not play a positive role in the rapid enhancement of the shielding fraction under \(P_{\text{lc}}\). Moreover, it should be noted that the slope for samples 2 and 3 abruptly changes at a critical pressure, which we designate as \(P_{\text{lc}}^{*}\), of around 0.4 GPa. Interestingly, the steep slope above \(P_{\text{lc}}^{*}\) for samples 2 and 3 is almost the same as the slope for sample 1.

We have also measured the temperature dependence of \(\chi_{\text{ac}}\) using the identical samples under \(P_{\text{lc}}\) with \(\mu_{0}H_{\text{ac}}\) of 2 \(\mu\)T-rms. These \(\chi_{\text{ac}}\) measurements cover low temperatures down to 0.3 K and enable us to observe the full Meissner state. As presented in Fig. 3(a), sample 1 exhibits a very sharp transition and no dissipation \(\chi^{\prime}\) above 1.5 K at 0 GPa. This sharp transition again supports that sample 1 can be treated as a pure Sr\({}_{2}\)RuO\({}_{4}\). By contrast, as shown in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c), broad transitions, typical of the eutectic system,[20] were observed above 1.5 K for samples 2 and 3 at 0 GPa.

By the application of \(P_{\text{lc}}\), a broad signal of ac shielding with the onset \(T_{c}\) of up to 3.2 K grows in all samples; the enhancement of the ac shielding fraction was clearly observed above 1.5 K even for pure Sr\({}_{2}\)RuO\({}_{4}\). These results are both qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the results of the dc magnetization measurements in Fig. 2. By contrast, at low temperatures, the ac shielding signal is reduced in magnitude and becomes broader with increasing

  \(P_{\rm lc}\). It should also be noted that the primary 1.5-K SC part in samples 1 and 2 is sustained with little change of its \(T_{c}\) under \(P_{\rm lc}\). These features imply that a region with widely distributed \(T_{c}\) from zero up to above 3 K emerges, replacing some parts of the 1.5-K SC (i.e., two superconducting phases coexist). Although the shielding signal near the onset \(T_{c}\) becomes somewhat smaller after removing uniaxial pressure [e.g., Fig. 4(a) of Ref. [26]], the recovery was not complete. Such irreversibility suggests that the enhancement of \(T_{c}\) is accompanied by distortions exceeding the elastic limit.

As evident in Fig. 3(c), the reduction in the shielding fraction and the broadening of the transition below 1.5 K become particularly significant for \(P_{\rm lc}\!\geq\!P_{\rm lc}^{\rm t}\) [Fig. 2(d)]. Above \(P_{\rm lc}^{\rm t}\), the interfacial 3-K SC around Ru inclusions also seems suppressed because the screening signal of the superconducting transition of Ru (\(T_{c}\!=\!0.49\) K) becomes substantially strong. Such screening signal of Ru SC was reproducibly observed in all the eutectic samples at higher \(P_{\rm lc}\).

Another important feature of the UP-induced higher-\(T_{c}\) SC is that the screening is insensitive to \(H_{\rm ac}\). As shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), the ac shielding fraction in pure Sr\({}_{2}\)RuO\({}_{4}\) was not affected by \(H_{\rm ac}\) at any \(P_{\rm lc}\) investigated. In contrast, the ac shielding fraction in sample 3 was sensitively suppressed by \(H_{\rm ac}\) of as small as 10 \(\mu\)T-ms below \(P_{\rm lc}^{\rm t}\) \(\sim\!0.4\) GPa [Figs. 4(c) and 4(d)]. This "weak" SC in the eutectic system is attributed to the formation of a Josephson network.[20] interfacial 3-K SC occurring near the Sr\({}_{2}\)RuO\({}_{4}\)-Ru interface penetrates into the normal-state Sr\({}_{2}\)RuO\({}_{4}\) region due to the proximity effect and forms Josephson-type weak links among the Ru lamellae. In this case, because of the small critical current in the Josephson network area, the ac field penetration is expected to become significantly deeper with increasing \(H_{\rm ac}\). Therefore the spatial distribution of superconducting regions is different between the two systems.

Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 4(e), the \(H_{\rm ac}\) dependence almost disappears in sample 3 above \(P_{\rm lc}^{\rm t}\). This disappearance, in conjunction with the observation in Figs. 2(d) and 3(c), can be consistently understood if the nature of the higher-\(T_{c}\) SC induced by UP in pure Sr\({}_{2}\)RuO\({}_{4}\) and that of SC in the eutectic crystal _above_\(P_{\rm lc}^{\rm t}\) is qualitatively the same.

From the present study, it is most likely that UP-induced higher-\(T_{c}\) SC is an intrinsic property of Sr\({}_{2}\)RuO\({}_{4}\) because the enhancement of the higher-\(T_{c}\) SC by \(P_{\rm lc}\) is more striking in samples with smaller amount of Ru inclusions. Let us here discuss possible mechanisms of the occurrence of the higher-\(T_{c}\) SC. While hydrostatic pressure destroys SC of Sr\({}_{2}\)RuO\({}_{4}\),[14, 15] UP induces SC with \(T_{c}\) above 3 K. These facts indicate that anisotropic distortions caused by UP in the crystal structure play essential roles in enhancing \(T_{c}\). Nevertheless, the present results are essentially different from the UP effect predicted from the ultrasonic experiments, \(dT_{c}/dP_{\rm lc}\)\(\sim\!1\) K/GPa. The observed onset \(T_{c}\) increases up to 3.2 K even at \(P_{\rm lc}\) of as small as 0.2 GPa but does not exceed 3.2 K at higher \(P_{\rm lc}\) [see Fig. 2(c)].

This disagreement with the hydrostatic pressure effect and the elastic-limit expectation suggests that a qualitative change in the electronic structure of Sr\({}_{2}\)RuO\({}_{4}\) arises at relatively low \(P_{\rm lc}\) and generates SC with enhanced \(T_{c}\). It is known that the electronic states of Sr\({}_{n+1}\)RuO\({}_{3n+1}\) series are significantly affected by the rotation, tilting, and flattening of the RuO\({}_{6}\) octahedra.[8, 9, 10] For example, \(P_{\rm lc}\) of about 0.4 GPa changes the electronic state of the bilayer system Sr\({}_{2}\)RuO\({}_{7}\) from a metamagnetic metal to a ferromagnetic metal.[13] In the case of Sr\({}_{2}\)RuO\({}_{4}\), its crystal structure is close to an instability

  against the in-plane RuO\({}_{6}\) rotation, as evidenced by the softening of the rotational phonon mode observed in inelastic neutron-scattering experiments. [7] Theoretically, it was predicted that the RuO\({}_{6}\) rotation leads to the decrease in the band widths and to the increase in \(T_{c}\) through the enhancement of the density of states associated with the van Hove singularity of one of the bands. [8, 30] Also, the tilting and flattening of the RuO\({}_{6}\) octahedra are expected to make the band widths narrower. [9]

The observed distribution of \(T_{c}\) in UP-induced higher-\(T_{c}\) SC may be explained by lattice imperfection. If \(T_{c}\) depends on the magnitude of local anisotropic distortion, \(T_{c}\) would be distributed because of experimentally unavoidable inhomogeneity of the distortion. In addition, \(T_{c}\) should be suppressed by the pair-breaking scatterings due to lattice imperfection, e.g., the dislocations or rapid spatial variation in the distortion, leading to the reduction in the mean-free path. Note that SC is completely destroyed in pure Sr\({}_{2}\)RuO\({}_{4}\) if the mean-free path is less than about 50 nm. [16] Therefore, the higher \(T_{c}\) is expected only in the Sr\({}_{2}\)RuO\({}_{4}\) region with a coherent distortion. This scenario is consistent with the recent report on the eutectic system [31] suggesting that the enhancement of \(T_{c}\) occurs in the Sr\({}_{2}\)RuO\({}_{4}\) region at least 18 nm away from the interface rather than at the immediate vicinity of the interface with a lot of dislocations.

To summarize, we present a report on the UP effect on Sr\({}_{2}\)RuO\({}_{4}\). We have found a remarkable increase in the onset \(T_{c}\) from 1.5 to 3.2 K induced by \(P_{|ic}\) below 0.2 GPa. This strong enhancement of \(T_{c}\) cannot be explained by the effect of \(P_{|ic}\) in the elastic limit deduced from the Ehrenfest relation for Sr\({}_{2}\)RuO\({}_{4}\). We have revealed that the dc shielding fraction associated with the UP-induced higher-\(T_{c}\) SC and the amount of Ru inclusions are anticorrelated. This fact clearly indicates that the higher-\(T_{c}\) SC is not associated with the presence of Ru inclusions.

There remain some important issues to be clarified. Although the spatial distribution of superconducting regions is revealed to be different between the UP-induced higher-\(T_{c}\) SC and the eutectic 3-K SC, the values of their \(T_{c}\)'s are surprisingly similar. It should be clarified whether or not the origin of the enhanced \(T_{c}\) is similar between UP-induced SC and the eutectic SC. Another important issue is to resolve the discrepancy between the results of previous hydrostatic-pressure study and of the present UP experiments. Additional experiments under in-plane UP and the crystal-structure analysis under UP may provide important clues although it is technically difficult at present to perform such experiments.
