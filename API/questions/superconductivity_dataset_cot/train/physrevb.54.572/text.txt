###### Abstract

The compound La2CuO4+_d_ is known to phase separate for 0.011 <= \(d\) <= 0.06 below a temperature _T_ps ~ 300 K into the nearly stoichiometric antiferromagnet compound La2CuO4 01-4.02 with Neel temperature _T_N ~ 250 K, and a metallic oxygen-rich phase La2CuO4 04 06 with superconducting transition temperature _T_c ~ 34 K. We report studies of the superconducting and normal-state static magnetic susceptibility _kh_ of La2CuO4 4+_d_ samples with 0 <= \(d\) <= 0.11 prepared by electrochemical oxidation or reduction of conventionally synthesized ceramic La2CuO4 4+_d_ The upper limit to the miscibility gap at low \(T\) is found be \(d\) <= 0.065, in agreement with the previous work. The interstitial oxygen diffusion during the phase-separation process was studied using thermal- and magnetic-field history-dependent _kh_(_kh_,_t_) measurements versus temperature \(T\) and time \(t\) as a probe. Phase separation is found to be suppressed by quenching at <=100 K/s and favored by slow cooling at ~ 0.5 K/min. A large thermal hysteresis of both the normal and superconducting state _kh_(_T_) was observed between data obtained after quenching to 5 K and then warming, and data obtained while or after slowly cooling from 300 K, for samples of La2CuO4 4+_d_ (_d_ = 0.030, 0.044) within the miscibility gap. Quenching reduces _T_c by ~ 5 K relative to the value (34 K) obtained after slow cooling. A similar decrease is found for La2CuO4 0.065 which does not phase separate, indicating the importance of oxygen-ordering effects within this single phase. A model for the excess oxygen diffusion is presented, from which the data yield a nearly _T_-independent activation energy for excess oxygen diffusion of (0.24 +- 0.03) eV from 150 to 220 K apart from a possible anomaly near 210 K.

## 1 Introduction

Phase separation has been found to occur in oxygen-doped La3CuO4 4+_d_,1-3 as proved by Jorgensen _et al._ from a neutron-diffraction study of a polycrystalline sample of La2CuO4 4+_d_ (_d_ ~ 0.03) synthesized under high oxygen pressure.4 A reversible macroscopic phase separation was observed below a temperature _T_ps ~ 320 K into two nearly identical orthorhombic phases with excess oxygen contents estimated5 to be \(d\) ~ 0.01 and \(d\) ~ 0.08 at 200 K, respectively. The oxygen-rich metallic \(d\) phase becomes superconducting below _T_c ~ 34-38 K,4 whereas the oxygen-poor \(d\)1 phase exhibits long-range antiferromagnetic (AF) order below the Neel temperature _T_N ~ 250 K.3 Thermopower,6-9 electrical resistivity,6-10 magnetic susceptibility _kh_,7,9,11 specific-heat,9,11 and nuclear magnetic resonance/nuclear quadrupole resonance12-15 (NMR/NQR) measurements have been found to show anomalies at _T_ps. From neutron-diffraction measurements on a single crystal with \(d\) ~ 0.03, the excess oxygen was found to be located in interstitial sites between adjacent LaO layers, tetrahedrally coordinated by four La atoms.16,17 In Ref. 17, the authors concluded that the miscibility gap boundaries at 15 K were \(d\)1 ~ 0 and \(d\)2 ~ 0.048. NMR/NQR studies of single crystals produced under high oxygen pressure indicate that the miscibility gap boundaries below ~ 200 K are \(d\)1 ~ 0.01 and \(d\)2 ~ 0.06.15,18 Ryder _et al._ have presented dark-field transmission-electron microscope images which revealed an anisotropic herringbone-type domain structure of the oxygen-rich and -poor phases of characteristic minimum dimension 300-1500 A.9

It has recently become possible to synthesize homogeneous polycrystalline19-26 and single crystal26,27,29 La2CuO4 4+_d_ samples with controlled variable composition d <= 0.12 by electrochemically oxidizing La2CuO4 in aqueous base at ambient temperature. This synthesis technique has allowed a detailed study of the phase diagram in the (_T_-_d_) plane. Neutron-diffraction measurements of the miscibility gap limits using such samples30 were in agreement with the above values found from NQR/NMR and the maximum _T_ps was found to be about 415 K for \(d\) ~ 0.03, as shown in the phase diagram for \(d\) <= 0.07 in Fig. 1.6,30-34 Samples with \(d\) = 0.08 to 0.12 showed no phase separation down to 10-16 K demonstrating that these compositions are beyond the upper miscibility gap limit d ~ 0.06.35

In order for macroscopic phase separation to occur below _T_ps in the La2CuO4 +_d_ system for compositions \(d\) within the miscibility gap, the excess oxygen ions (and their doped holes) must obviously diffuse distances large compared to the unit cell dimensions. On the other hand, the excess oxygen ions should also become frozen in place at sufficiently low temperatures. On the basis of 139La spin-lattice relaxation rate data, Hammel _et al._ concluded that the mobility of the excess oxygen becomes insufficient below ~ 190-200 K to allow macroscopic phase separation to proceed.15,18 In contrast, Ryder _et al._9 have also explained their observed hysteresis in the resistivity between 150 and 280 K, obtained on slowly cooling and warming (0.2 K/min), as due to phase separation, and they concluded that diffusion of the excess oxygen is significant down to \(\sim\)150 K.

The superconducting and normal-state properties below \(T_{\rm ps}\) of phase-separated compositions of La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) are expected, and found,[3, 6, 7, 9, 15, 18, 23, 28, 29, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 7  

### Magnetic susceptibility measurements and quenching procedures

Temperature- (_T_) dependent dc magnetic susceptibilities _kh_(_T_) and superconducting transition temperatures \(T_{c}\) were measured using a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. The scan length was 4 cm for all measurements. Samples of La2CuO4+_d_ were quenched from ~300 K directly into liquid nitrogen at 77 K and quickly transferred to the precooled SQUID magnetometer at 5 K in zero applied magnetic field \(H\). Alternatively, samples were inserted directly into the precooled magnetometer at 5 K from ambient temperature. The average quenching rate is estimated to be >=100 K/min. No significant differences were found for either the superconducting or normal-state magnetic properties between these two quenching procedures. The susceptibilities after quenching, _kh_Q(_T_), were measured upon warming. The susceptibility data measured while slowly cooling, _kh_SL(_T_), were obtained upon cooling from ~300 K in temperature steps of 5 or 10 K. There was a momentary undercool of about 5 to 15 K below the set temperature for data taken on cooling. The average cooling rate for the discrete slow cooling process was 0.4-0.7 K/min. The time for the sample chamber temperature to stabilize at a new temperature for warming and cooling experiments is estimated to be about 4 and 10 min, respectively. The measuring time to obtain each \(M\) value was <30 sec. Ferromagnetic impurity contributions of ~(8.4 to 10.8)x10-5 G cm2/g, equivalent to the magnetization of ~3 at. ppm of Fe metal impurities with respect to Cu, were determined by extrapolating linear fits to the _M_(_H_) isotherm data to \(H\) = 0 from \(H\) > 1.5 T at 300 K; these contributions were corrected for in the _kh_(_T_) data presented below. Superconducting properties were measured at low field (_H_ = 10 Oe) on warming, either after quenching or slow cooling; to minimize the remanant field of the magnet, the magnet was quenched before each such measurement.

To measure the \(t\) dependence of _kh_ at a fixed \(T\), a sample was first quenched to 5 K in zero applied field as described above. The \(T\) was then quickly raised to the minimum measurement \(T\) and _kh_(_t_) measured for about 1 h. After measurements at the initial minimum \(T\), subsequent measurements at higher \(T\) in increments of 5 or 10 K were made after heating from the last measurement \(T\).

## III Experimental results

### Miscibility gap

According to proposed _T_-_d_ phase diagrams for La2CuO4+_d_[13, 18, 23, 22, 30] our samples with _d_d_=0.030 and 0.044 are expected to be separated below _T_ps into two phases with compositions at the miscibility gap boundaries _d_i_  0.01 and _d_i_  0.06, respectively. On the basis of previous work cited above, the \(d\)1 phase is antiferromagnetic with _T__N_~250 K, whereas the \(d\)2 phase is superconducting with \(T_{c}\) = 32-34 K. Our samples with \(d\)  0.065 and 0.110 do not phase separate according to the previous neutron-diffraction results on these samples, [35] whereas _T_ps~270 K for the \(d\)  0.044 sample. [30]

Figure 2 shows _kh_(_T_) data for four samples of La2CuO4+_d_ with \(d\)  0.02, 0.030, 0.044, and 0.065. The data for \(d\)  0.030 and 0.044 were obtained upon warming, after slowly cooling in order to maximize phase separation, whereas the data for the other two samples were measured upon warming after quenching to 5 K.

The normal-state _kh_(_T_) data are shown in Fig. 2(a). The pronounced peaks in _kh_(_T_) at \(T_{N}\)  250 K, associated with AF ordering of the \(d\)1 phase and plotted in Fig. 1, are seen to decrease in magnitude with increasing \(d\) and to essentially disappear by \(d\)  0.065. This indicates that the upper miscibility gap composition at _T_~250 K is \(d\)  0.065, consistent with the structural data in Fig. 1. From Fig. 2(a), the peak in _kh_(_T_) due to the AF \(d\)1 phase becomes rounded with increasing \(d\), particularly for the _d_=0.044 sample; a very similar _kh_(_T_) behavior was observed [11] for a single crystal with [48]\(T_{\rm ps}\)=(260 +- 5) K and \(T_{N}\) = (245 +- 3) K. This evolution makes it difficult to separate the effects on _kh_(_T_) due to phase separation and AF ordering of the \(d\)1 phase for the more heavily doped samples. The evolution in the shape of the anomaly with increasing \(d\) suggests a reduction in the domain size of the \(d\)1 phase with increasing \(d\) within the miscibility gap region.

According to Fig. 1, the minimum \(T_{N}\) observed for the La2CuO4+_d_ system should be ~250 K. However, from magnetization (\(T_{N}\) = 0-300 K), [33] (\(T_{N}\) = 130 K), [49] (\(T_{N}\) = 135-305 K), [50] (\(T_{N}\) = 32-310 K), [51] muon spin rotation (\(T_{N}\) = 10-300 K), [52] and neutron diffraction (\(T_{N}\) = 45-295 K) (Ref. [53]) measurements, \(T_{N}\) values less than 50 K have been observed. [54] These low values are presumably associated with the presence of cation vacancies, impurities and/or nonequilibrium excess oxygen contents or distributions in particular samples.

Figure 2: (a) Normal-state magnetic susceptibilities _kh__c_ versus temperature \(T\) for La2CuO4+_d_ samples with \(d\)  0.02, 0.030, 0.044, and 0.065, measured in an applied magnetic field \(H\) = 0.5 T. (b) Magnetic susceptibility _kh__c_ versus temperature \(T\) for the La2CuO4+_d_ samples with \(d\)  0.030, 0.044, and 0.065. The data were measured at \(H\) = 10 Oe upon warming after field cooling.

 Information about the miscibility gap was also obtained from superconducting state \(\chi(T)\) data. Shown in Fig. 2(b) are \(\chi_{g}(T)\) data for the La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) samples with \(\delta\)=0.030, 0.044, and 0.065. These data were obtained on warming after slowly field cooling the samples in \(H\)=10 Oe from \(\approx\)295 K. The measured field-cooled \(\chi\) values are good indicators of change of the superconducting volume fraction, when demagnetization factor, density of pinning center, and penetration depth are assumed to be the same in these samples. The measured \(\chi\)(5 K) values of the superconducting \(\delta_{2}\) phase increase monotonically with increasing \(\delta\), whereas the \(T_{c}\) of this phase, plotted in Fig. 1, is nearly constant at 32\(-\)34 K. These data are consistent with the miscibility gap boundaries \(\delta_{1}\)\(\approx\)0.01\(-\)0.02 and \(\delta_{2}\)\(\approx\)0.06 in Fig. 1.

### Thermal and magnetic-field history dependence of \(T_{c}\) and of the superconducting fraction

The superconducting state magnetic susceptibilities \(\chi_{g}(T)\) measured with \(H\)=10 Oe for La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) samples with \(\delta\)\(\approx\)0.030, 0.065, and 0.11 are shown in Fig. 3. For each sample, data are presented both after quenching and slow cooling from 295 K. For \(\delta\)\(\approx\)0.030, which is within the miscibility gap, the field-cooled data in Fig. 3(a) show that the slowly cooled sample has both a larger \(T_{c}\) (by \(\approx\)5 K) and diamagnetic susceptibilities than the quenched sample. On the other hand, for \(\delta\)\(\approx\)0.065, which shows no phase separation according to neutron-diffraction analysis,[35] the sample obtained after slowly cooling has a higher \(T_{c}\) (by \(\approx\)2 K) but almost no superconducting fraction change, compared with the quenched sample. The data in Fig. 3(b) for \(\delta\)\(\approx\)0.110, which also does not exhibit phase separation,[35] show no difference in the superconducting properties between quenching and slow cooling. Similar thermal history dependences of \(T_{c}\) have been observed previously for samples of La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) with \(\delta\) within the miscibility gap.[3, 9, 13, 18, 15, 28, 30, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43] We conclude that this thermal hysteresis effect on \(T_{c}\) observed in phase-separated samples arises at least in part from the hysteretic effect in the pure La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4.065}\) phase in those samples. The latter behavior may in turn reflect thermal history-dependent oxygen ordering effects, consistent with the neutron-diffraction data for the La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4.065}\) sample which showed superlattice reflections presumably associated with spatial ordering of the excess oxygen atoms.[35]

We have carried out several experiments on La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4.044}\) to study whether the superconducting properties depend on the magnetic-field history.[36, 39] The superconducting state \(\chi_{g}(T)\) data in Fig. 4 were obtained after quenching to 5 K in a 10 Oe field and also after annealing at 190 K [Fig. 4(a)] or 210 K [Fig. 4(b)] for 1 h in fields of 0.5 or 5 T, and then field cooling to 5 K in a field of 10 Oe. The superconducting state data in Fig. 4 show no observable dependence on the field at which the annealing at 190 or 210 K was carried out. Thus, these measurements do not confirm the field dependences of the superconducting properties reported for \(\delta\)\(\approx\)0.02 in Refs. 36 and 39.

### Time dependence of the normal-state magnetic susceptibility at fixed temperature

The time \(t\) evolution at fixed temperature \(T\) of the magnetic susceptibility \(\chi\) for La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4.044}\) was measured after ini

Figure 4: Magnetic susceptibility \(\chi_{g}\) of La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4.044}\) in an applied field \(H\)=10 Oe versus temperature \(T\). The samples was first quenched from 300 to 5 K in \(H\)=10 Oe and \(\chi(T)\) measured on warming (open squares). Then the sample was annealed for 1 h in \(H\)=0.5 T (diamonds) or 5 T (filled squares) at a temperature \(T_{\rm ann}\) of 190 K (a) or 210 K (b), quenched again to 5 K in \(H\)=10 Oe, and \(\chi(T)\) remeasured on warming.

The samples were either quenched (open symbols) or slowly cooled (filled symbols) from 295 to 5 K in \(H\)=10 Oe prior to measurement on warming.

  tially quenching the sample to 5 K and then rapidly heating the sample to the first (lowest) measurement \(T\). _kh_(_T_,_t_) data were measured at this \(T\) for about 1 h. The sample was then repeatedly heated to the next higher measurement \(T\), which was either 5 or 10 K above the previous one, and the measurement repeated. A typical complete measuring cycle for \(H\) = 5 T is shown in Fig. 5(b). Note that at a given measurement \(T\), this sequence preserves the previous time evolutions in the sample at lower measurement temperatures.

For an ideal quench, one would expect _kh__Q_(_T_) in Fig. 5(a) to be due to the supersaturated system containing a homogeneous distribution of excess oxygen. However, the anomalies between 150 and 260 K observed in the _kh__Q_(_T_) data in Fig. 5(a), reflecting long-range AF order, indicate that phase separation has occurred in the quenched sample. The most probable explanation is that our quenching rate is not fast enough to completely prevent phase separation; evidence for this is the slight positive curvature in _M_(_H_) for \(H\) > 0.3 T for the quenched sample of La2CuO4.044 (not shown). The distinct positive curvature in _M_(_H_) for \(H\) >= 3 T for the slowly cooled sample signals the transition into the weak ferromagnetic (WFM) state with increasing \(H\), consistent with the occurrence of phase separation in this sample. On the other hand, the quenched sample shows a more nearly linear _M_(_H_) behavior, suggesting that the phase-separation transition is suppressed in this sample. A second major contributing factor is that even if the quench to 5 K is ideal, phase separation occurs during the _kh__Q_(_T_) measurement upon heating due to unfreezing of the excess oxygen above ~150 K (see below), resulting in the formation of an AF phase which then shows a _kh_(_T_) anomaly at \(T_{N}\) ~250 K.

The measured \(t\) dependences of _kh_ at \(H\) = 5 T for La2CuO4.044 at each fixed \(T\) from 150 to 290 K are shown in Fig. 6. For 150 K <= \(T\) <= 260 K, _kh_(_T_,_t_) increases with \(t\), but the 1 h measurement time at each \(T\) is not long enough for _kh_ to grow to the equilibrium _kh__S_L_LC(_T_) values (see Fig. 5). The slight decrease in _kh_(_T_,_t_) with \(t\) for \(T\) > 270 K <= _T_ps (not shown) indicates that a significant time is required for the sample to reach internal thermal equilibrium even for \(T\) > _T_ps.

## IV Analysis and discussion

### The approach of the susceptibility of quenched La2CuO4.044 towards equilibrium

To provide initial insight into the kinetics leading to the time dependence of _kh_(_t_) for La2CuO4.044 after quenching and increasing \(T\) to the measurement temperatures in Fig. 6, it is useful to consider the approach of _kh_(_t_) to equilibrium normalized by the difference between _kh_ at the start of the measurement at a particular \(T\) and the equilibrium value. Thus, let us define the fractional approach to equilibrium for \(H\) = 5 T by

\[f(t) = \frac{\chi(t) - \chi(t = 0)}{\chi^{\rm SLC} - \chi(t = 0)},\]

Figure 5: (a) Normal-state magnetic susceptibility _kh__g_ vs temperature \(T\) for La2CuO4.044. The sample was zero-field quenched from ∼295 to 5 K first and then measured at \(H\) = 0.5 or 5 T upon warming, yielding _kh__Q_(_T_) data. After the _kh__Q_(_T_) data were obtained at a given field up to 300 K, data were obtained upon slowly cooling in \(T\) increments of 5 K, as indicated, denoted by _kh__S_L_SC(_T_). (b) Magnetic susceptibility _kh__g_ of La2CuO4.044 versus temperature \(T\), at an applied field \(H\) = 5 T measured upon warming after quenching to 5 K (open circles), or while slowly cooling from 295 K (filled circles). The multiple data points for constant \(T\) ≥ 150 K reflect the time dependence of _kh__g_ measured over a period of about 11 h. Data for La190K50.04CuO4 from Ref. 57 (lowest solid curve), _kh__X_(_T_) in Eqs. (11)–(13), represent the behavior expected for La2CuO4.044 in the absence of phase separation.

Figure 6: The time \(t\) evolution of the magnetic susceptibility _kh_(_t_)/_kh_(0) of La2CuO4.044 after quenching from ∼300 to 5 K and heating to successive constant temperatures (a) \(T\) = 150–200 K, (b) \(T\) = 210–260 K. For clarity, only a representative fraction of the data is shown.

  where \(\chi^{\rm SLC}\) is the equilibrium value at a particular temperature as determined upon slowly cooling the sample (see Fig. 5). The function \(f(t)\) is plotted in Fig. 7, where it is seen that the normalized rate of approach to equilibrium increases monotonically with increasing \(T\) from 150 up to 220 K. This implies that the diffusion rate of the excess oxygen also increases monotonically with \(T\) over this \(T\) range.

Oxygen diffusion during phase separation in La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\beta}\) A model for the time dependence of the magnetic susceptibility at fixed temperature

In this section, we derive a phenomenological model for analyzing the above time (\(t\))-dependent susceptibility data, from which we derive the temperature-dependent diffusion coefficient of the excess oxygen and the diffusion coefficient activation energy. One expects the linear size \(S\) of the oxygen-rich domains to initially increase during phase separation as a power law in \(t\), \(S\)\(\sim\)\(t^{x}\), where the exponent is \(x\)\(\sim\)1/3 to 1/2 for a system such as ours with a conserved order parameter.[55] Therefore, if the diffusion resulting in phase separation is effectively one dimensional (1D), the number \(N_{2}\) of excess oxygen atoms in the oxygen-rich phase should initially scale as \(N_{2}\)\(\sim\)\(t^{x}\), whereas if the diffusion is two dimensional (2D), \(N_{2}\)\(\sim\)\(t^{2x}\). Thus, including both 1D and 2D cases, we expect that \(N_{2}\) should initially grow as \(N_{2}\)\(\sim\)\(t^{1/3}\) to \(N_{2}\)\(\sim\)\(t\). We wish to synthesize a model which contains the initial power-law time dependence, allows consideration of both 1D and 2D diffusion, and which explicitly contains the diffusion coefficient.

We begin by closely following the treatment of Shewmon.[56] One may describe the oxygen drift flux \(J_{\rm df}\) driven by the phase separation as \(J_{\rm df}\)\(=\)\(c\)\({\bf v}_{\rm df}\)\(=\)\(c\)\(\mu\)\(F\), where \(c\) is the excess oxygen concentration, \(\mu\) and \({\bf v}_{\rm df}\) are, respectively, the mobility and drift velocity of the excess oxygen, and \(F\)\(=\)\(-\)\(\nabla\)\(V\) is a generalized force driving the phase separation and which is associated with the potential \(V\). The Einstein relation relates \(\mu\) to the diffusion constant \(D\) of a random walk as \(\mu\)\(=\)\(D/k_{B}T\). Thus, one obtains

\[J_{\rm df}\)\(=\)\(c\)\({\bf v}_{\rm df}\)\(=\)\(\frac{-Dc\)\(\nabla\)\(V}{k_{B}T}\).

Since the phase-separation process causes an accumulation of oxygen, an opposing diffusion flux, \(J_{\rm diff}\)\(=\)\(-\)\(D\)\({\bf\nabla}\)\(c\), is induced according to Fick's first law. The total flux of excess oxygen is the sum of the drift flux and the diffusion flux,

\[J\)\(=\)\(J_{\rm diff}\)\(+\)\(J_{\rm df}\)\(=\)\(-\)\(D\)\(\nabla\)\(c\)\(c\)\(\nabla\)\(V/k_{B}T\)).

Inserting Eq. (2) into the continuity equation \(\partial c/\partial t\)\(=\)\(-\)\(\nabla\)\(\cdot\)\({\bf J}\) yields a differential equation for \(c\)(**r**,\(t\)):[56]

\[\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}\)\(=\)\(D\)\(\nabla\)\((\nabla\)\(c\)\(+\)\(c\)\(\nabla\)\(V/k_{B}T)\).

One can obtain a closed-form expression for \(c\)(**r**,\(t\)) if we neglect the influence of \(\nabla\)\(c\).[55] This assumption appears to be justified because the phase-separation process in La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) is diffusion limited.[9] Then Eq. (3) becomes

\[\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}\)\(=\)\(c\)\(D\)\(\frac{\nabla^{2}V}{k_{B}T}\).

The solution is

\[c\)\(({\bf r},t)\)\(=\)\(c\)\({\rm exp}\)\(\left[\)\(Dt\)\(\frac{\nabla^{2}V}{k_{B}T}\)\(\right]\),

where \(c\)\({}_{\rm o}\) is the (uniform) excess oxygen concentration prior to phase separation.

Knowledge of \(V\)(**r**) is necessary to obtain a solution for \(c\)(**r**,\(t\)) in Eq. (5). In an analysis of 3D stress-assisted precipitation, Shewmon has shown that the concentration of precipitated regions has a \(t^{\prime 2/3}\) time dependence for \(V\)(**r**)\(=\)\(-\)\(\beta\)/\(r\) in the short time limit where \(\nabla\)\(V\) is dominant and \({\bf\nabla}\)\(c\)\(\sim\)0.[56] Here, we extend this calculation to 1D and 2D segregation. For 1D diffusion, we assume the general form

\[\frac{dV({\bf r})}{dr}\)\(=\)\(\frac{\epsilon}{x_{\rm o}}\)\(\left[\)\(\frac{x_{\rm o}}{r}\)\(\right]^{\alpha}\), in 1D,

where \(x_{\rm o}\) is an arbitrary scale length and \(r\) is the distance from the potential core line. In 2D, we assume that

\[V(r)\)\(=\)\(\frac{-\)\(\gamma}{r^{2\alpha}}\), in 2D,

where \(\gamma\)\(>\)0 is a constant and \(r\) is the radial distance of an excess oxygen atom from the potential core. In Eqs. (6), the power \(\alpha\) determines the initial time dependence of the number of excess oxygen atoms in the oxygen-rich phase during phase separation (see below), and these postulated forms for \(V\)(**r**) were chosen in order to obtain the same [see Eq. (9) below] time dependences for a given \(\alpha\) in the 1D and 2D cases. We now assume that the area \(A\) from which the excess oxygen diffuses to a potential core is finite in extent, as would occur if there is a regular array of identical potential cores. This assumption is consistent with the herringbone pattern of phase-separated regions in La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) observed in Ref. 9; these micrographs also suggest that the 1D diffusion model may be more appropriate than the 2D one. In 1D, let \(A\)\(=\)\(L\)\(r_{\rm o}\), where \(L\) is the length of the potential core line and \(r_{\rm o}\) is the transverse dimension of the area \(A\). In 2D, let \(A\)\(=\)\(\pi\)\(r_{\rm o}^{2}\), where \(r_{\rm o}\) is now the radius of the area \(A\). For the 1D and 2D potentials suggested above in Eqs. (6), one obtains

Figure 7: The function \(f(t)\)\(=\)\([\chi(t)-\chi(t=0)]\)\(\chi^{\rm SLC}\)\(-\chi(t=0)]\) versus time \(t\), showing the fractional approach of the susceptibility \(\chi(t)\) towards equilibrium. For clarity, only a representative fraction of the data is shown.

  \[c(r,t) = \frac{N_{2}(t)}{A}\delta(r) + c_{\rm o}\exp\left[ \frac{-CDtr_{\rm o}^{(\alpha +1)}}{k_{B}Tr^{2(\alpha +1)}} \right],\quad\text{in 1D}\]

\[c(r,t) = \frac{N_{2}(t)}{A}\delta(r) + c_{\rm o}\exp\left[ \frac{-CDtr_{\rm o}^{2(\alpha +1)}}{k_{B}Tr^{2(\alpha +1)}} \right],\quad\text{in 2D},\]

where \(N_{2}(t)\) is the number of excess oxygen atoms in the oxygen-rich \(\delta_{2}\) phase at time \(t\), i.e., in the potential core, \(\delta(r)\) is the Dirac delta function and \(C = \epsilon\alpha/r_{\rm o}^{1 + \alpha}x_{\rm o}^{1 - \alpha}\) for the 1D case and \(C = 4\gamma\alpha^{2}/r_{\rm o}^{2 (\alpha + 1)}\) for the 2D case. From Eqs. (7), phase separation proceeds by the unphysical accumulation of excess oxygen on a potential core line (in 1D) or a potential core point (in 2D) at \(r = 0\), which would correspond to infinite density. Physically, one reinterprets \(N_{2}\) to be the number of phase separated atoms present at the physically realized density of the \(\delta_{2}\) phase.[56] This accumulation depletes the region around the potential core of excess oxygen atoms until, at long times, there are no excess oxygen atoms outside of the potential core. Examples of the concentration profiles outside of the potential core versus \(r\) for various \(t\) for the 1D case with \(\alpha = 1\) from Eq. (7a) are shown in Fig. 8. Thus, in this model the equilibrium (\(t = \propto 0\)) concentration of excess oxygen atoms in the oxygen-poor \(\delta_{1}\) phase is zero. Were it not for the freezing of the excess oxygen atoms below \(\sim\)150 K, the left edge of the miscibility gap in the equilibrium phase diagram might approach \(\delta_{1} = 0\), in contrast to the presumably nonequilibrium behavior seen below \(\sim\)150 K in Fig. 1.

Since the total number \(N\) of excess oxygen atoms associated with each potential core is constant (\(N = c_{\rm o}A\)), one can obtain \(N_{2}(t)\) by integrating the exponential term in Eqs. (7) as in Fig. 8 out to the edge of the region containing the potential core (i.e., to \(r = r_{\rm o}\)), and subtracting this result from the total number \(N\) of excess oxygen atoms:

\[N_{2}(t) = Lc_{\rm o}\int_{0}^{r_{\rm o}}\left[ 1 - \exp\left( \frac{-CDtr_{\rm o}^{(\alpha + 1)}}{k_{B}Tr^{2(\alpha + 1)}} \right) \right]dr,\quad\text{in 1D}\]

and

\[N_{2}(t) = \pi c_{\rm o}\int_{0}^{r_{\rm o}^{2}}\left[ 1 - \exp\left( \frac{-CDtr_{\rm o}^{2(\alpha + 1)}}{k_{B}Tr^{2(\alpha + 1)}} \right) \right]dr^{2},\quad\text{in 2D}.\]

After changing variables to \(u = [CDtr^{(\alpha + 1)}/k_{B}Tr^{(\alpha + 1)}]^{1/2}\) in the 1D case and \(u = [CDtr_{\rm o}^{2(\alpha + 1)}/k_{B}Tr^{2(\alpha + 1)}]^{1/2}\) in the 2D case, and normalizing to the equilibrium number, \(N_{2}(t = \propto ) = N = c_{\rm o}Lr_{\rm o}\) in 1D and \(N = c_{\rm o}\pi r_{\rm o}^{2}\) in 2D, of excess oxygen atoms in the oxygen-rich phase, one obtains for both the 1D and 2D cases

\[\frac{N_{2}(t)}{N_{2}(\infty)} = \frac{2}{\alpha + 1}\left(CDt/k_{B}T\right)^{1(\alpha + 1)}\] (9) \[\times \int_{(CDt/k_{B}T)^{1/2}}^{\infty}\frac{1 - \exp(- u^{2})}{u^{(\alpha + 3)(\alpha + 1)}}\ du.\]

For \(CDt/k_{B}T \ll 1\), Eq. (9) predicts an initial time dependence \(N_{2}(t)/N_{2}(\infty) \sim (CDt/k_{B}T)^{1/(\alpha + 1)}\), whereas for \(CDt/k_{B}T \gg 1\), \(N_{2}(t)/N_{2}(\infty) \to 1\). From the introduction to this section, we wish to examine values of \(\alpha\) such that the initial \(N_{2}(t) \sim t^{\gamma}\) with \(y = 1/(\alpha + 1) = 1/3 to 1, corresponding to \(\alpha = 2\) to 0. Note that the time parameter \(t\) at a particular temperature \(T\) is the time since phase segregation started for an ideally quenched sample, as determined at that \(T\). However, our quenched sample is already partially phase separated (see below), and the degree of phase separation at the beginning of a \(\chi(t)\) measurement at fixed \(T\) increases with \(T\) because of the sequential order of the measurements. Therefore, to fit to our experiments, we replace \(t\) in Eq. (9) by \(t_{\rm o} + t\), where the latter \(t\) is the measured time elapsed at a particular \(T\):

\[\frac{N_{2}(t)}{N_{2}(\infty)} = \frac{2}{\alpha + 1}\left[CD(t_{\rm o} + t)/k_{B}T\right]^{1/(\alpha + 1)}\] (10) \[\times \int_{\{CD(t_{\rm o}

  \[\chi = \frac{N_{1}}{N}\chi_{1} + \frac{N_{2}}{N}\chi_{2} + \left\lfloor 1 - \frac{N_{1} +N_{2}}{N} \right\rfloor\chi_{x}\,,\]

where _kh_1, _kh_2, and _kh__x_ are the molar susceptibilities of the respective pure phases at temperature \(T\). Equation (11) implicitly assumes that the susceptibilities of the \(d\)1, \(d\)2, and untransformed \(d\) phases are independent of particle size, shape, and edge width, which are not necessarily good approximations in view of the data for La2CuO4.044 in Fig. 2(a). However, we have no information on these particle properties below _T_ps or the dependences of the susceptibilities on them with which to refine the model. By combining Eq. (11) with the oxygen atom conservation expression \(N_{1}\delta_{1} + N_{2}\delta_{2} = \left(N_{1} + N_{2} \right)\delta\), one obtains

\[\chi - \chi_{x} = \frac{N_{2}}{N}\left[ \left\langle \frac{\delta_{2} - \delta}{\delta - \delta_{1}} \right\rangle\left(\chi_{1} - \chi_{x} \right) + \chi_{2} - \chi_{x} \right]\]

and, at the time of \(t\) = \(t\)0 + \(t\) and \(t\) = \(o\) from Eq. (12), the desired form

\[\frac{\chi \left(t_{\text{o}} + t \right) - \chi_{x}}{\chi^{\text{SLC}} - \chi_{x}} = \frac{N_{2}\left(t_{\text{o}} + t \right)}{N\left( \infty \right)}\,,\]

where _kh_L_C_ is(_t_ = _o_) is the equilibrium susceptibility in Fig. 5 obtained upon slowly cooling the sample.

The ideal quenched susceptibility _kh__x_ in Eq. (13) for La2CuO4.044 is estimated to be that of an equivalently hole-doped sample of La2-_x_Sr_CuO4. In the low doping regime (_d_ <= 0.08) of La2CuO4.04 + \(o\) each excess oxygen appears to donate about one hole to the CuO2 planes,27,35,34 in contrast to two holes/excess oxygen atom expected for O-2. Consistent with the former hole-doping assignment, _kh__x_(_T_) for La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 with \(x\) = 0.04,57 is in close agreement with _kh__(_T_) for La2CuO4.044 above _T_ps/270 K, as shown by the lower solid curve in Fig. 5(a). Further, comparison of the data at ~100 K for La2CuO4.044 with those for La196Sr0.04CuO4 in Fig. 5(b) shows that our quenching procedure does not result in an ideal quench for La2CuO4.044.

We illustrate our data fitting procedure for the value \(a\) = 1. Using Eq. (13), the _kh__L_C_(_T_) data and the _kh__x_(_T_) for \(x\) = 0.04 in Fig. 5(b), we determined the constant _t_o and the product _CD_ in Eq. (10) at each \(T\) which allowed the data for \(H\) = 5 T at each fixed \(T\) in Figs. 5-7 to be scaled onto the solid curve in Fig. 9. The scaled data are plotted in Fig. 9, and the fitting parameters _CD_ and _t_o are plotted versus 1/_T_ and \(T\) in Figs. 10(a) and 10(b), respectively. In Fig. 10(b), the value of _t_o is seen to increase with decreasing \(T\), which is expected since the oxygen mobility decreases with decreasing \(T\). From Fig. 10(a), the diffusion constant \(D\) of the excess oxygen atoms shows an activated temperature dependence with a nearly temperature-independent activation energy \(E_{a}\) = (2810 +- 20) K = 0.234 eV. Similar analyses with \(a\) = 0, 0.5, and 2 yielded \(E_{a}\) = 2457, 2582, and 3155 K, respectively. Since the actual effective dimensionality of the oxygen diffusion during phase separation in La2CuO4+_d_ is unclear, we conclude that within our model, the activation energy is \(E_{a}\) = (2800 +- 350) K = (0.24 +- 0.03) eV. Analysis of 0.5 T data as in Figs. 5-7 as above gave good agreement with the model, with the same value of \(E_{a}\) to within the given error bar and similar _t_o(_T_) values as in Fig. 10(b). Our value for \(E_{a}\) is comparable with the rough estimate between 200 and 250 K (0.25 eV) obtained in a 139 La NQR study of high-pressure-oxygenated La2CuO4+_d_ with \(d\) = 0.03,18 which together with our result suggests a similar activation energy for diffusion from 150 K up to at least 250 K. We note, however, that the data in Figs.

Figure 10: (a) Product of the constant \(C\) and the diffusion constant \(D\) for the excess oxygen in La2CuO4.044, versus inverse temperature (1/_T_), and (b) the parameter _t_o versus \(T\). The parameters _CD_ and _t_o were obtained by fitting the data in Figs. 5–7 to the model calculation in Eqs. (10) and (13) (solid curve in Fig. 9).

An ideal quench is assumed at time \(t\) + _t_o = 0 The solid curve is the prediction of our model in Eq. (10) with _α_ = 1, and the data points are fits of the data in Figs. 5–7 to the curve using Eq. (13); for clarity, only a few representative data points are plotted.

  10(a) and 10(b) suggest a possible anomaly at \(\sim\)210 K in the temperature-dependent diffusion coefficient and _t_o values.

Comparison of the above oxygen diffusion properties in La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) with those inferred from other probes

The above \(\chi(t,T)\) results in Figs. 5-7 indicate that after quenching to 5 K, phase separation in La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4,044}\) is first observable with increasing \(T\) at 140-150 K. This result is consistent with the structural data in the phase diagram in Fig. 1, where the sides of the miscibility gap first begin to deviate from the vertical above \(\sim\)150 K. Our result is also consistent with the high precision resistivity data of Ryder _et al._,[9] which first exhibit resolved hysteresis between slowly cooled and heated samples above \(\sim\)150 K, and with the detailed studies of Kremer and co-workers for \(\delta\)\(\approx\)0.02,[39; 40; 41] in which the first increase in the apparent superconducting volume fraction of quenched samples occurred above \(\sim\)150 K.

From Fig. 7, the normalized phase-separation rate increases monotonically with increasing \(T\) from 150 to 220 K. From our modeling of these data in Fig. 9 using Eqs. (10) and (13), we confirmed that the diffusion constant for the diffusing species giving rise to the phase separation increases with \(T\), and obtained a nearly temperature-independent diffusion coefficient activation energy \(E_{a}\) = (0.24 +- 0.03) eV from 150 to 220 K, with the exception of a possible anomaly near 210 K. We conclude that the same species (excess oxygen atoms) is responsible for phase separation and its influence on the physical properties throughout this \(T\) range. This conclusion is in agreement with that of Ref. [9], but is in contrast to a previous suggestion (see Introduction) that diffusion of ferrons _without_ concurrent oxygen diffusion occurs below \(\sim\)200 K in initially quenched samples with \(\delta\)\(\approx\)0.02.[39; 40; 41]

In \({}^{139}\)La and \({}^{63}\)Cu NMR/NQR studies of lightly doped La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\), an enhanced nuclear relaxation rate due to motion of the excess oxygen is observed only above \(\sim\)200 K.[43; 58; 59; 60; 61; 62; 63] Since we have concluded that the rate of excess oxygen diffusion increases continuously above 150 K, the observation of relaxation in the NMR/NQR measurements due to oxygen motion only above \(\sim\) 200 K is evidently due to the fact that the time scale of our \(\chi(t,T)\) measurements is \(\sim\)10\({}^{9}\) times longer than that of NMR/NQR. To illustrate, the oxygen-induced \({}^{139}\)La NQR/NMR relaxation above 200 K for samples with \(\delta\)\(\approx\)0.01 has been quantitatively explained using a two-dimensional (2D) oxygen self-diffusion and random-walk model.[60; 61] These measurements indicate a 2D self-diffusion constant which follows the relation \(D\) = (0.067 cm\({}^{2}\)/s)exp(\(-\)5000 K/\(T\)).[61] On a \(t\) = 1 h time scale, the calculated diffusion length \(\sqrt{Dt}\) is 60 \(\mu\)m at 200 K and 90 A at 150 K. The value at 150 K is clearly large enough to influence the superconducting and magnetic properties even though the NMR/NQR measurements are not sensitive to oxygen diffusion at this \(T\).

One should bear in mind that many previous studies of the thermal history dependence of the physical properties were carried out on La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) samples with \(\delta\)\(\approx\)0.02, whereas most of our data are for \(\delta\)=0.044. From Fig. 1, the latter composition has a different ambient temperature structure than the former one, and may have a different excess oxygen diffusion behavior during phase separation. Consistent with this possibility, the activation energy of 5000 K for 2D excess oxygen self-diffusion cited above for \(\delta\)\(\approx\)0.01 (Ref. [61]) is \(\approx\)70% larger than we find for \(\delta\)=0.044. Oxygen diffusion studies to lower doping levels would be of interest in this regard.

Thermal history dependence of the superconducting properties of phase-separated La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\)

Previous interpretations of the thermal history dependence of the superconducting properties invariably implicitly assumed that they were related to the phase separation process. However, in Fig. 3, we demonstrated that a suppression of \(T_{c}\) of the pure superconducting \(\delta_{2}\)=0.065 phase by \(\approx\)2 K occurs upon quenching compared to slowly cooling, even though this is a single phase to 10 K. This thermal history dependence is presumably associated with variations in the nature and degree of crystallographic ordering of the excess oxygen atoms, as reflected by the occurrence of superstructure reflections in neutron-diffraction[35] and transmission-electron microscopy[23; 64] measurements. Consistent with this scenario, the pressure dependence of \(T_{c}\) for the \(\delta_{2}\) phase depends on the temperature at which the pressure is changed.[44] Thus, a significant fraction of the reduction in \(T_{c}\) of phase-separated La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) samples due to quenching appears to arise from behavior intrinsic to the pure \(\delta_{2}\) phase.

Several workers have found that following a quench, \(T_{c}\) for \(\delta\)\(\approx\)0.03 shows a maximum for annealing temperatures \(T_{\rm ann}\) around 200 K,[13; 18; 42; 43; 13] which is significantly below the phase-separation temperature \(T_{\rm ps}\) (see Fig. 1). Again, this behavior may be in part associated with thermal history-dependent oxygen ordering effects within the \(\delta_{2}\) phase. An additional factor may be the spatial variation in the excess oxygen content in phase-separated samples. The above analysis indicated that the drift rate of the excess oxygen and the rate of phase separation decrease rapidly with decreasing \(T\) below \(T_{\rm ps}\). On the other hand, the opposing diffusion flux [the first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (2), which was neglected in the above analysis] tends to restore the system to a uniform oxygen concentration. This diffusion flux would tend to make the oxygen concentration within the oxygen-rich \(\delta_{2}\) domains inhomogeneous, particularly near the domain boundaries, and decrease the domain size. These effects of the diffusion flux would decrease with decreasing \(T\). Below \(\sim\)150\(-\)200 K, however, oxygen diffusion becomes limited and the phase-separation process is arrested. The optimum \(T_{c}\) obtained for \(T_{\rm ann}\)\(\approx\)200 K is probably associated with both enhanced oxygen ordering in, and optimized size and homogeneity of, the oxygen-rich superconducting \(\delta_{2}\) domains.[65; 66]

Our quenching procedures appear to be very similar to those by Kremer and co-workers in Refs. [39; 40; 41]; however, our samples show a much smaller influence of the thermal treatment on the Meissner effect than those with \(\delta\)\(\approx\)0.02 studied by Kremer _et al._, suggesting that oxygen diffusion at a given \(T\) is faster in our samples with \(\delta\)=0.030 and 0.044 than in theirs with \(\delta\)\(\approx\)0.02 (see above), and/or that flux pinning is weaker for \(\delta\)=0.044. Similar to our results in Fig. 3(a), the Meissner fraction of high-pressure-oxygenated La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) crystals with \(\delta\)\(\approx\)0.03 is relatively large and is insensitive to \(T_{\rm ann}\) following a quench.[13; 18; 42]  

### Mechanism for phase separation

Based on a _t-J_ model calculation, chargeless doped holes in a CuO\({}_{2}\) plane of the high superconducting transition temperature (\(T_{c}\)) cuprates do not have a uniform density. Rather, they are predicted to separate into a hole-rich metallic phase and a hole-deficient insulating phase below a certain critical doping concentration, thereby minimizing the antiferromagnetic (AF) bond-breaking energy.[67, 68] For macroscopic phase separation to occur and not to be frustrated by the long-range Coulomb interaction between the doped holes, the dopant ions must phase separate along with the doped holes in order to compensate the holes' charge.[69] From Fig. 6, we inferred that \(T_{\rm ps}\)\(>\)\(T_{N}\) in La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4,044}\), as was also found from NMR and neutron-diffraction results on high-pressure-oxygenated La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) single crystals.[13, 48] This inequality is further confirmed by the large difference between the maximum \(T_{\rm ps}\)\(\sim\)415 K (Ref. [30]) and maximum \(T_{N}\)=325-328 K (Refs. [6, 31, 32, 47]) reported for the La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) system. The apparent observation that \(T_{\rm ps}\)\(<\)\(T_{N}\) (Refs. [8] and [10]) for some samples with compositions apparently just to the right of the left miscibility gap boundary (see Fig. 1) is the exception rather than the rule. Thus, long-range AF ordering cannot be a significant driving force for phase separation below \(T_{\rm ps}\), since in that case one would always expect \(T_{\rm ps}\)\(<\)\(T_{N}\). Indeed, the magnetic (electronic) mechanism for phase separation[67, 68, 69] only requires the presence of dynamic two-dimensional short-range AF order, rather than three-dimensional long-range AF order. Elastic forces may also be important to phase separation in La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) as in other cases of spinodal decomposition.[9, 70]

Although macroscopic phase separation is prevented in the Sr-doped La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) system because the Sr\({}^{+2}\) ions are immobile and cannot phase separate along with the doped holes, dynamic nanoscopic inhomogeneities in the doped-hole concentration are still expected from the electronic scenario for phase separation.[69] Indeed, recent \({}^{139}\)La NQR and \(\chi(T)\) measurements provided evidence for an inhomogeneous doped-hole distribution in lightly doped La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) (x\(\approx\)0.08), where the doped holes were concluded to segregate into walls separating weakly coupled hole-poor AF domains; the domain size \(L\)\(\sim\)10-100 A was inferred to decrease with increasing \(x\).[34, 57, 71, 72, 73] Similar conclusions have been made for the \(R\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) materials.[1, 2] These observations provide indirect support for an electronic contribution to the mechanism for phase separation in the La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) system. Experimental studies of the thermal history dependence of the physical properties such as the present work and the works cited above are now sufficiently detailed to warrant quantitative theoretical predictions of these properties for the various mechanisms proposed for phase separation. Such quantitative study is necessary to definitively establish whether the phase separation is driven primarily by an electronic or elastic mechanism.
