###### Abstract

We report synthesis and detailed characterization of the
noncentrosymmetric superconductor Re₆Hf using powder x-ray diffraction
(XRD), magnetization, transport, and thermodynamic measurements. XRD
confirmed the noncentrosymmetric, α-Mn cubic structure in Re₆Hf with the
cubic cell parameter a = 9.6850(3) A. Resistivity, DC, and AC
magnetization measurements confirmed the type-II superconductivity in
Re₆Hf with the transition temperature $T_{c}^{\rm onset}\sim 5.96$ K,
having the lower critical field H_(c1)(0) 5.6 mT and upper critical
field H_(c2)(0) 12.2 T. The electronic specific heat data fits well with
the single-gap BCS model. The Sommerfeld coefficient (γ) also shows
linear relation with the magnetic field. All above results suggest
s-wave superconductivity in Re₆Hf.

## I Introduction

In 1957, Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS) explained the origin of
superconductivity using the concept of Cooper pairs [1]. Cooper pairs
are formed from electrons that have equal and opposite crystal momenta
and spin. Since electrons are fermions, the wave function must be
antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of two electrons. The two
electron wave function can be made asymmetric by considering the spatial
and spin components. If the spatial wave function is
symmetric/antisymmetric, then the spin wave function must be
antisymmetric/symmetric. This is termed as spin-singlet
state/spin-triplet state. This scenario is only possible if inversion
symmetry is present in crystal structure [2,3].

There have been intense theoretical and experimental studies on
superconducting systems lacking spatial inversion symmetry, following
the discovery of unconventional superconductivity in the
noncentrosymmetric (NSC) heavy fermion compound CePt₃Si [4]. In a NCS
superconductor (SC), the absence of the center of inversion induces
Rashba-type antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling (ASOC) due to an
asymmetric potential gradient along the crystal axis. This momentum
dependent spin structure in consequence lifts the degeneracy of the
conduction band electrons at the Fermi surface resulting into the
possible mixing of spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing states. The
magnitude of ASOC splitting actually dictates the extent of mixing of
spin-singlet and spin-triplet components [5-10]. The possible mixing of
pair states in NCS superconductors may lead to various superconducting
properties such as the upper critical field exceeding Pauli limit, point
or line nodes in the superconducting gap parameter resulting into nodal
excitations in penetration depth, heat capacity and other thermodynamic
measurements, and time reversal symmetry breaking in the superconducting
condensate [11].

Apart from CePt₃Si several other Ce- and U-based heavy fermionic NCS
SCs, e.g., CeRhSi₃[12,13], CeIrSi₃[14,15], CeCoGe₃[16], and UIr [17]
were discovered with applied pressure, however this does not resolve the
problem as strong electron correlations in the f-electron systems with
superconductivity at the vicinity of the magnetic quantum critical point
hinder the pursuit to realize the effects of ASOC and the absence of an
inversion center on superconductivity. Superconductivity in these
systems is expected to be due to the unconventional pairing mechanism,
most likely driven by magnetic fluctuations. Hence, several weakly
correlated and nonmagnetic NCS superconducting systems, e.g.,
Li₂(Pd,Pt)₃B [18-22], LaNiC₂[23,24], Y₂C₃[25], L₂C₃[26] Re₃W [27],
Mg₁₀Ir₁₉B₁₆[28], LaMP(M=Ir, Rh and P=P, As) [29], Mo₃Al₂C [30,31],
Rh₂Ga₉[32,33], Ir₂Ga₉[32,33], Ru₇B₃[34-36], Nb_(0.18)Re_(0.82)[37-39],
La₇Ir₃[40], and Re₂Zr [41,42] were investigated to understand the
primary mechanism for unconventional superconductivity in NCS SCs. It
was found that only a few of them exhibited unconventional
superconducting behavior including triplet pairing [10,22,40,41,43] and
upper critical field close to the Pauli limit [25,31]. Others exhibited
only dominant s-wave character.

Theoretical results suggest that ASOC play an important role in
controlling the mixing of spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing channel.
In NCS superconductor Li₂(Pd,Pt)₃B [10,18-22,44], it was shown that the
pairing state can be tuned from spin-singlet to spin-triplet by changing
the strength of ASOC. Here substitution of the Pt element with strong
spin-orbital coupling to the site of the Pd element changes the overall
mixing of pairing states leading to unconventional superconductivity.

Recently, noncentrosymmetric superconductor Re₆Zr shows an
unconventional superconducting ground state having the signature of time
reversal symmetry breaking with dominant s-wave pairing by muon
spectroscopy [41]. As spin-orbital coupling varies as Z⁴, by
substituting Zr by Hf, the strength of the spin-orbit coupling can be
enhanced by a factor of 10 in Re₆Hf compared to Re₆Zr. This in turn may
increase the contribution of the spin-triplet component in the
superconducting ground state. In this paper, we present the results of
measured superconducting properties of intermetallic binary compound
Re₆Hf exhibiting bulk superconductivity at $T_{c}^{\rm onset}\sim 5.96$
K. Superconducting properties were determined by resistivity,
magnetization, and specific heat measurements in Re₆Hf and results were
compared to Re₆Zr to elucidate the effects of enhanced ASOC.

## II Experimental details

A polycrystalline sample of Re₆Hf (3g) was synthesized using the
standard arc-melting technique where the stoichiometric amounts of
Hf(4N) and Re(4N) were taken in a nominal ratio of 6:1 on a water cooled
copper hearth under the flow of high purity argon gas. Both the elements
were melted together to make a single button of Re₆Hf, then flipped and
remelted several times for the sample homogeneity. The sample formed was
hard and silvery gray in color with negligible mass loss.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a PANalytical diffractometer
equipped with CuK_(α) radiation (λ = 1.54056 A) for the characterization
of crystal structure and phase purity. Magnetization and AC
susceptibility measurements were performed using a Quantum Design
superconducting quantum interference device (MPMS 3, Quantum Design). In
magnetization measurement, the sample was cooled down to 1.8 K in zero
field and then a field of 10 mT was applied. The data were recorded
while warming it to 10 K called ZFCW mode, whereas in the FCC mode, the
sample was cooled down to 1.8 K in a 10 mT field with data taken
simultaneously. Magnetization and AC susceptibility measurements were
also done under different applied fields in a temperature range of 1.8 K
to 8.0 K in magnetic fields up to 7.0 T. Specific heat measurements were
performed by the two tau time-relaxation method using the physical
property measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design, Inc.) in zero field
and under applied magnetic fields up to 7.0 T. The electrical
resistivity measurement was performed on the PPMS by using a
conventional four-probe ac technique at frequency 157 Hz and excitation
current 10 mA. The measurement was done in zero field from 1.85 K to 300
K to know the residual resistivity ρ₀ and residual resistivity ratio
(RRR).

## III Results and discussion

### Sample characterization

Polycrystalline sample of Re₆Hf was crushed into a very fine powder for
XRD analysis. The powder XRD data was collected at room temperature as
shown in Fig. 1. Rietveld refinement was performed using High Score Plus
Software. The refinement shows that the sample is in single phase with
no impurity. Re₆Hf crystallizes into a cubic, noncentrosymmetric α_-Mn_
structure with lattice cell parameter a = 9.6850(3) A. The primitive
Bravais lattice adopts the space group $I\bar{4}3m$ (space group no.
217). There are around eight formula units per unit cell. The material
is intrinsically disordered, which is reflected in the low value of the
residual resistivity ratio and high residual resistivity seen in the
section below. Refined cell parameters and atomic positions are shown in
Table 1.

### Normal and superconducting state properties

#### iii.2.1 Electrical resistivity

The temperature dependence of the resistivity for Re₆Hf between 1.85 K
and 300 K in zero magnetic field is shown in Fig. 2(a). Resistivity
increases leisurely with temperature showing poor metallic behavior. The
residual resistivity ratio is found to be ρ(300)/ρ(10) = 1.47, which is
very small, suggesting that resistivity has either little temperature
dependence or is dominated by disorder. This behavior is similar to
other Re based α_-Mn_ compounds Nb_(0.18)Re_(0.82) (RRR ∼ 1.3) [37],
Re₂₄Ti₅ (RRR ∼ 1.3) [45], and Re₆Zr (RRR ∼ 1.10) [41,42]. An expanded
plot of the zero-field resistivity data ρ(T) is shown in the inset of
Fig. 2(a), which shows a superconducting transition at the onset
temperature T_(c)^(onset) = 5.96 K, with the transition width of
ΔT = 0.41 K.

The low temperature resistivity data have been fitted to a power law

ρ = ρ₀ + AT²
(1)

from 10 K  ≤ T≤ 50 K, as shown in Fig. 2(b) by the solid red line. First
term ρ₀ is the residual resistivity due to crystallographic defects and
the second term is the electronic contribution to resistivity due to
electron-electron scattering at low temperatures in the Fermi-liquid
picture. Here A is taken as a measure of the degree of electron-electron
correlation.

By fitting Eq. (1), we obtained ρ₀ = 106.12 ± 0.02μΩ cm and
A = (2.79 ± 0.01) × 10⁻³μΩ cm K⁻². The higher value of ρ₀ is most likely
due to the polycrystalline nature of the sample. The value of A is low,
indicating a weakly correlated system. Resistivity doesn’t increase
significantly

from its residual resistivity ρ₀ value in the fitted temperature range
due to dominance by disorder but shows a quadratic temperature
dependence as shown in Fig. 2(b), which can be described by Fermi-liquid
behavior [31,37,42,45,46].

#### ii.2.2 Magnetization

The superconductivity in Re${}_{\rm e}$Hf was confirmed by the
magnetization data taken in ZFCW and FCC mode as shown in Fig. 3. The
data were taken in low applied field of 10 mT, showing the onset of
strong diamagnetic signal due to superconducting transition at
$T_{c}^{\rm onset}=5.94$ K. Superconducting transition was further
confirmed by AC susceptibility (Fig. 4) measurement.

Figure 5(a) shows the low field (0-30 mT) magnetization curves M(H) for
Re${}_{\rm e}$Hf taken at different temperatures. Lower critical field
H_(c1)(T) is defined as the field deviating from the linear line for
initial slope in magnetization curve. The H_(c1) is 5.2 mT at T = 1.8 K
and decreases monotonically with increase in temperature to 1.0 mT at
T = 5.5 K. The temperature variation of H_(c1)(T) is shown in Fig. 5(b).
As expected H_(c1)(T) varies as a function of T² in accordance with
Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory

$$H_{c1}(T)=H_{c1}(0)\left(1-\left(\frac{T}{T_{c}}\right)^{2}\right).$$

Lower critical field H_(c1)(0) was estimated to be 5.6 ± 0.5 mT by
fitting the relation given in Eq. (2) in the data given in Fig. 5(b).

A magnetization curve at 1.8 K in high applied magnetic field range (±7
T) is shown in Fig. 6. As evident from the graph, Re₆Hf exhibits a
conventional type-II superconductivity. H_(Irr) estimated from
magnetization curve is 1.80 T at 1.8 K, here for fields H > H_(Irr)
unpinning of vortices starts taking place.

#### iii.2.3 Specific heat

Specific heat C(T) measurement for Re₆Hf in zero field in the
temperature range 1.85 K  ≤ T≤ 10 K is shown in Fig. 7(a). The
superconducting transition in specific heat data is manifested by a
sharp jump in C(T) at T_(c) = 5.96 K, confirming bulk superconductivity
in Re₆Hf. The field dependence of the specific heat is shown in Fig.
7(b), where a jump near T_(c) moves to lower temperature and the size of
the jump ΔC becomes smaller with increasing magnetic field. The low
temperature normal state specific heat can be extracted easily with the
relation

$$\frac{C}{T}=\gamma_{n}+\beta_{3}T^{2}+\beta_{5}T^{4},$$
(3)

where the extrapolation of normal state behavior below T_(c), to the T→
0 limit, allows the determination of normal state Sommerfeld coefficient
γ_(n), Debye constant β₃, and the anharmonic contribution β₅ to the
specific heat. By fitting Eq. (3) between 36 K  ≤ T²≤ 100 K, as shown by
the solid

Figure 5: (a) Low-field magnetization curves for Re₆Hf at various
temperatures (b) Temperature dependence of the lower critical field

mT.

dependence of the specific heat data, showing the suppression of T_(c)

red line in Fig. 8, we obtained γ_(n) = 27.2 ± 0.1 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻², β₃ =
0.28 ± 0.05 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻⁴, and β₅ = 0.0014 ± 0.0003 μJ mol⁻¹ K⁻⁶.

The Debye temperature θ_(D) is related to the β₃ coefficient through the
formula

$$\theta_{D}=\left(\frac{12\pi^{4}RN}{5\beta}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}$$
(4)

where R is the molar gas constant (=8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹). Using N (=7) the
number of atoms per formula unit, it gives θ_(D) = 364 K. For
noninteracting particles, the Sommerfeld coefficient is proportional to
the density of states D_(C)(E_(F)) at the Fermi level which is
calculated to be 11.53 $\frac{\text{states}}{c^{3}V/\mu}$ from the
relation given by

$$\gamma_{n}=\left(\frac{\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}}{3}\right)D_{C}(E_{f})$$
(5)

where k_(B)≈ 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J K⁻¹.

This calculated density of states D_(C)(E_(f)), and the effective mass
m^(*) of quasiparticles, contains the influence of the many body
electron-phonon interaction and is related to the bare band-structure
density of states D_(band)(E_(f)) and m_(band)^(*) according to relation

D_(C)(E_(f)) = D_(band)(E_(f))(1 + λ_(e, ph))
(6)

m^(*) = m_(band)^(*)(1 + λ_(e, ph))
(7)

where λ_(e, ph) is the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling constant.
The electron-phonon coupling constant which gives the strength of
attractive interaction between electron and phonon can be calculated
using θ_(D) and T_(c) given in McMillan theory McMillan (1963) by

$$\lambda_{e-ph}=\frac{1.04+\mu^{*}ln(\theta_{D}/1.45T_{c})}{(1-0.62\mu^{*})ln( \theta_{D}/1.45T_{c})-1.04}$$
(8)

where μ^(*) is the repulsive screened coulomb parameter, typically given
by μ^(*) = 0.13 for many intermetallic superconductors. Using
T_(c) = 5.96 K (from our specific heat measurement) we obtained
λ_(e − ph) = 0.63. This value is comparable to other fully gapped
noncentrosymmetric superconductors such as 0.6 for Re₂₄Ti₅Kimura _et
al._ (2015), 0.5 for Nb_(0.18)Re_(0.82)Miyazaki _et al._ (2015), Re₆Zr
K₂Kimura _et al._ (2015), and SrAuSi₃Kimura _et al._ (2015) suggesting
that Re₆Hf is a moderately coupled superconductor. Using the value of
λ_(e − ph), we calculated D_(band)(E_(f)) equal to 7.04
$\frac{\text{states}}{c^{3}V/\mu}$. Also by taking m_(band)^(*) = m_(e)
the effective mass for the quasiparticles comes out to be 1.63 m_(e).

The electronic contribution to the specific heat in the superconducting
state C_(el)(T) can be calculated by subtracting the phononic
contribution from the measured data C(T)

C_(el)(T) = C(T) − β₃T³ + β₅T⁵.
(9)

The magnitude of the specific heat jump $\frac{\Delta C_{el}}{T_{c}}$ at
T_(c) is 41.55 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻². This gives the normalized specific heat
jump $\frac{\Delta C_{el}}{\gamma_{n}T_{c}}=1.53$ for γ_(n) = 27.2 mJ
mol⁻¹ K⁻², which is slightly higher than the BCS value of
$\frac{\Delta C_{el}}{\gamma_{n}T_{c}}=1.43$ in the weak coupling limit.

The temperature dependence of the specific heat data in the
superconducting state can best be described by the single-gap BCS
expression for normalized entropy S

$$\frac{S}{\gamma_{n}T_{c}}=-\frac{6}{\pi^{2}}\left(\frac{\Delta(0)}{k_{B}T_{c} }\right)\int_{0}^{\infty}[f\ln(f)+(1-f)\ln(1-f)]dy$$
(10)

where f(ξ) = [exp (E(ξ)/k_(B)T) + 1]⁻¹ is the Fermi function,
$E(\xi)=\sqrt{\xi^{2}+\Delta^{2}(t)}$, where ξ is the energy of normal
electrons measured relative to the Fermi energy, y = ξ/Δ(0),
t = T/T_(c), and Δ(t) = tanh [1.82(1.018((I/t) − 1))^(0.51)] is the BCS
approximation for the temperature dependence of the energy gap. The
normalized electronic specific heat is related to the normalized entropy
by

$$\frac{C_{el}}{\gamma_{n}T_{c}}=t\frac{d(S/\gamma_{n}T_{c})}{dt}$$
(11)

where C_(el) below T_(c) is described by Eq. (11), whereas above T_(c)
it is equal to γ_(n)T_(c). Figure 9 shows the fitting of specific heat
data to Eq. (11) which yields α = Δ(0)/k_(B)T_(c) = 1.82 ± 0.03, which
is slightly larger than the BCS value α_(BCS) = 1.764 in the weak
coupling limit, suggesting a moderately coupled superconductivity in
Re₆Hf as concluded from the value of λ_(e, ph) obtained earlier.

Figure 9: Solid green curve in C_(el)/γ_(n)T versus T/T_(c) data show
the single-gap BCS model fitting for α = Δ(0)/k_(B)T_(c) = 1.82.

In the α model BCS parameter α_(BCS) is replaced by α which can be
determined from the jump ΔC_(el) at T_(c) according to the formula
ΔC_(el)/γ_(n)T_(c) = 1.426(α/α_(BCS))². Substituting the value of
normalized specific heat jump ΔC_(el)/γ_(n)T_(c) = 1.53 for our sample,
we get α = 1.82 which is in good agreement with the fitted value
obtained above showing the consistency of the method.

The fully gapped s-wave superconductivity in Re₆Hf can also be confirmed
by the magnetic field dependence of the Sommerfeld coefficient γ(H). The
Sommerfeld coefficient is proportional to the vortex density in a
conventional fully gapped type-II superconductor. Therefore, as we apply
more field the vortex density increases due to an increase in the number
of field induced vortices which in turn enhances the quasiparticle
density of states. This gives rise to a linear relation between γ and H,
i.e., γ(H) ∝ H for a nodeless and isotropic s-wave superconductor [48;
49; 50]. For a superconductor with nodes in the gap, Volovik predicted a
nonlinear relation given by $\gamma(H)\propto H^{\frac{1}{2}}$[51].

The Sommerfeld coefficient γ was calculated by fitting Eq. (12) in
C_(el)/T versus T data for various fields and extrapolating it to T = 0
K [48]

$$\frac{C_{el}}{T}=\gamma+\frac{A}{T}\text{exp}\bigg{(}\frac{-bT_{c}}{T}\bigg{)}.$$
(12)

Field dependence of γ is shown in Fig. 10 where we can clearly observe a
linear relation between γ(H) and H confirming the s-wave
superconductivity in Re₆Hf which we have already seen by the single-gap
BCS fitting in low temperature specific heat measurement.

The condensation energy U (0) can be calculated using γ and
α( = Δ(0)/k_(B)T_(c)) from the relation

$$U(0)=\frac{1}{2}\Delta^{2}(0)D_{\text{band}}(E_{f})=\frac{3\gamma_{n}\Delta^{ 2}(0)}{4\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}}$$
(13)

which gives U(0) = 246.1 mJ mol⁻¹. The magnitude of electron-electron
correlation can be given by Kadowaki-Woods ratio, which is given by
K${}_{w}=\frac{A}{\gamma_{n}^{2}}$, where A is the coefficient of the
quadratic temperature dependent resistivity term, whereas γ_(n) is the
normal state Sommerfeld coefficient. In heavy fermionic systems where
electron-electron correlation is significant the Kadowaki-Woods ratio
K_(w) approaches 1 × 10⁻⁵μΩ cm mJ⁻²mole² K²[52; 53; 54]. For
A = 0.00279μΩ cm K⁻² and γ_(n) = 27.2 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻², we found
K_(w) = 0.37 × 10⁻⁵μΩ cm mJ⁻² mole² K² which is smaller than strongly
correlated systems indicating that Re₆Hf is a weakly correlated system.

Isothermal magnetization measurement was done in magnetic fields up to
7.0 T to calculate the upper critical field H_(c2)(0) as shown in the
inset of Fig. 11. The transition temperature T_(c) was taken as the
onset of the diamagnetic signal in magnetization measurement. As the
field increases, T_(c) shifts to lower temperature with the
superconducting transition becoming broader. H_(c2)(T) was seen to be
varying linearly when plotted against reduced temperature (T/T_(c)) as
displayed in Fig. 11, and can be fitted using the Ginzburg-Landau (GL)
formula to calculate H_(c2)(0)

$$H_{c2}(T)=H_{c2}(0)\frac{(1-t^{2})}{(1+t^{2})}$$
(14)

where t = T/T_(c). Our experimental data fits fairly well with Eq. (14)
yielding the upper critical field H_(c2)(0) to be around 12.2 ± 0.1 T.
The similar linear behavior of H_(c2)(T) was noted when calculated from
specific heat measurements C(T) as shown by blue data points in Fig. 11;
when fitted with GL formula it gives H_(c2)(0) ≈ 12.2 T.

H_(c2)(0) can be used to estimate the Ginzburg Landau coherence length
ξ_(GL) from the relation [55]

$$H_{c2}(0)=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi_{GL}^{2}}$$
(15)

where Φ₀( = 2.07 × 10⁻¹⁵ Tm²) is the magnetic flux quantum. Using
H_(c2)(0) = 12.2 T we calculated ξ_(GL)(0) ≈ 52 A.

In a type-II superconductor, Cooper pair breaking due to the applied
magnetic field is attributed to two types of mechanisms: orbital and
Pauli paramagnetic limiting field

magnetization and heat capacity measurements. The solid lines are
Ginzburg-Landau [Eq. (14)] fits. The inset shows the M(T) curves for
various applied magnetic fields.

s-wave superconductivity in Re₆Hf.

effect. In orbital pair breaking, the field-induced kinetic energy of a
Cooper pair exceeds the superconducting condensation energy, whereas in
Pauli paramagnetic limiting it is energetically favorable for the
electron spins to align with the magnetic field, thus breaking the
Cooper pairs. For BCS superconductors, the orbital limit of the upper
critical field H_(c2)^(orbital)(0) was given by the
Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) expression [56,57]

$$H_{c2}^{\text{orbital}}(0)=-\alpha T_{c}\frac{dH_{c2}(T)}{dT}\bigg{|}_{T=T_{c}}$$
(16)

where α is the purity factor given by 0.693 for dirty limit
superconductors and 0.73 for clean limit superconductors. Initial slope
$\frac{-dT_{c2}(T)}{dT}\big{|}_{T=T_{c}}$ calculated from the H_(c2)-T
phase diagram is 2.36 T K⁻¹, which gives the orbital limiting upper
critical field H_(c2)^(orbital)(0) ≈ 9.77 T in the dirty limit. The
Pauli limiting field within the BCS theory is given by
H_(c2)^(P)(0) = 1.86T_(c)[58,59], which for T_(c) = 5.96 K gives
H_(c2)^(P)(0) ≈ 11.10 T. The Maki parameter [60]α_(M) is the measure of
relative strengths of the orbital and Pauli limiting values of H_(c2)
and is given by

$$\alpha_{M}=\sqrt{2}H_{c2}^{orb}(0)/H_{c2}^{P}(0).$$
(17)

From this relation we obtain α_(M) = 1.24. The sizable value of Maki
parameter obtained from this expression is an indication that the effect
of Pauli limiting field is non-negligible [37]. Since upper critical
field H_(c2)(0) calculated above is close to both the orbital limiting
field and Pauli limiting field, it is highly desirable to do the
detailed investigations of the upper critical field in high quality
single crystals of Re₆Hf. If H_(c2)(0) actually exceeds Pauli limit in
clean single crystals of Re₆Hf, it confirms the contribution of
spin-triplet component in superconducting pairing state. Anisotropic
measurements of upper critical field H_(c2)(0) also aspires since the
paramagnetic pair breaking effect depends on the spin structure of the
paired electrons in momentum space which can give more information on
effects of the ASOC and broken inversion symmetry on the superconducting
state.

The Ginzburg Landau penetration depth λ_(GL)(0) can be obtained from
H_(c1)(0) and ξ_(GL)(0) using the relation [28]

$$H_{c1}(0)=\bigg{(}\frac{\Phi_{0}}{4\pi\lambda_{GL}^{2}(0)}\bigg{)}ln\bigg{(} \frac{\lambda_{GL}(0)}{\xi_{GL}(0)}\bigg{)}.$$
(18)

For H_(c1)(0)≈ 5.6 mT and ξ_(GL)(0) = 52 A, we obtained λ_(GL)(0)≈ 3538
A.

The Ginzburg Landau (GL) parameter is given by the relation

$$k_{GL}=\frac{\lambda_{GL}(0)}{\xi_{GL}(0)}.$$
(19)

For ξ_(GL)(0) = 52 A and λ_(GL)(0) = 3538 A, we get k_(GL)≈ 68. GL
parameter $k_{GL}\gg\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, indicating that Re₆Hf is a
strong type-II superconductor. Thermodynamic critical field H_(c) is
obtained from k_(GL), H_(c1)(0), and H_(c2)(0) using the relation [28]

H_(c1)(0)H_(c2)(0) = H_(c)²lnk_(GL)
(20)

yielding H_(c) around 126.7 mT.

Ginzburg number G_(i) is the ratio of thermal energy k_(B)T (where the
upper limit of T is T_(c)) to condensation energy associated with
coherence volume, which measures the sensitivity of the vortex system
against thermal fluctuations [61,62]

$$G_{i}=\frac{1}{2}\bigg{(}\frac{k_{B}\mu_{0}\tau T_{c}}{4\pi\xi^{3}(0)H_{c}^{2 }(0)}\bigg{)}^{2}$$
(21)

where r is the anisotropy parameter which is 1 for cubic Re₆Hf. For ξ₀ =
52 A, H_(c)(0) = 126.7 mT, and T_(c) = 5.96 K, we got G_(i) = 6.65 ×
10⁻². It was already noticed from the magnetization curve that melting
of vortices starts at field H > H_(fr)( = 1.8 T) which is much smaller
than the upper critical field. This behavior is usually found in high
temperature superconductors where melting of vortices is attributed to
thermal fluctuations and very rarely in low T_(c) superconductors.
G_(i), which is found to be of the same order as high T_(c)
superconductors, suggests that thermal fluctuations may be playing a
role in unpinning of vortices. This is intriguing since most of the low
T_(c) superconductors do not show vortex unpinning due to thermal
fluctuations. This seems to be the case here also, since estimation of
critical fields was quite straightforward with no significant broadening
of thermodynamic measurements with the magnetic field, indicating an
unconventional vortex state. Some theoretical and experimental work also
suggested that noncentrosymmetric superconductors have an unconventional
vortex state [63, 64, 65, 66]. Hence, a detailed study on the vortex
dynamics of the good quality single crystal of Re₆Hf is needed to
interpret these transverse results.

## IV. Conclusion

A single phase polycrystalline sample of Re₆Hf was prepared by
arc-melting technique, which crystallizes into cubic, noncentrosymmetric
α-Mn (217) structure with lattice cell parameter a = 9.6850(3) A.
Transport, magnetization, and thermodynamic measurements reveal that
Re₆Hf is a weakly correlated, type-II superconductor with the bulk
transition temperature at T_(c)≈ 5.96 K. Above transition temperature
T_(c), resistivity measurement showed the poor metallic behavior whereas
magnetization measurement showed weak paramagnetism. The computed value
of the upper critical field H_(c2)(0)(≈ 12.2 T) is close to the Pauli
limiting field, hence further investigations need to be done to explore
the

possible mixture of singlet and triplet pairing states. Low temperature
specific heat measurement indicates that Re₆Hf is a moderately coupled
superconductor and it was further confirmed by the field dependence of
Sommerfeld coefficient γ(H) where it varies linearly with H suggesting
that electronic states near the Fermi surface are fully gapped. A
similar type of behavior was observed in Re₆Zr in its initial
measurements. Experimentally estimated values of all the parameters for
our sample and Re₆Zr are summarized in Table 2. From Table 2 it is very
clear that Re₆Zr and Re₆Hf parameters are almost the same despite Re₆Hf
having much stronger spin-orbital coupling strength compared to Re₆Zr.
These results suggest that along with spin-orbital coupling strength
some other mechanism/phenomena is playing a role in determining the
strength of spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing channel. In order to
fully understand the role of spin-orbital coupling, further experimental
work on high-quality single crystals is required.

_Note._ Recently, we became aware that superconductivity was reported on
the same compound by another group [67].
