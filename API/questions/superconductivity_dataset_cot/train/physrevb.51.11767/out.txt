# Abstract

The upper critical field H_{c2} and other equilibrium properties of a magnetically aligned HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+8} superconductor have been investigated. Experimental results for the reversible magnetization, both with **H**\parallel_c_ and **H**\parallel_ab_, are analyzed using the theoretical formalism of Hao _et al._ [Phys. Rev. B **43**, 2844 (1991)] for type-II superconductors. Near T_{c}, the slopes dH_{c2}/dT of the upper critical field are -1.6 T/K and -12.1 T/K for fields parallel and perpendicular to the c axis, respectively. These correspond to coherence lengths (extrapolated to T\!=\!0) of \xi_{ab}(0)\!=\!15 A and \xi_{c}\!=\!1.9 A. This gives a lower bound on the superconductive anisotropy parameter \gamma\!=\!(m_{c}/m_{ab})^{1/2}\!\geq\!8.

## Introduction

The equilibrium properties of high-T_{c} superconductors, such as the upper critical fields H_{c2} and the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}, are important, because they give relatively direct information about the microscopic parameters. These include the superconducting coherence length \xi and the magnetic penetration depth \lambda, particularly for the interesting case in which the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the CuO layers in the superconductors. Studies of aligned materials also can provide lower bound estimates for the degree of superconducting anisotropy.

In earlier analyses of dc magnetization measurements, Welp _et al._[1] obtained values for H_{c2} for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-8} by determining a nucleation temperature T_{c}(H). This temperature was constructed by linearly extrapolating the temperature-dependent reversible magnetization M in the superconducting state (with H\!=\!fixed) to the normal-state base line. Hao _et al._[2] pointed out, however, that much of the experimental magnetization data corresponded to fields H far below H_{c2}(T). Under these conditions, the usual linear relation between M and H near H_{c2}(T) [which follows from Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory[3]] does not adequately describe their functional relationship. Indeed, the experiments showed that the slopes dM/dT changed with field, confirming that simple linear relationships between M and H are not correct. As described below, Hao and Clem developed a more sophisticated theory that enables one to determine many fundamental properties of a superconductor from studies of the reversible magnetization in the intermediate-field region.[4] This formalism is most useful well below T_{c}, where fluctuation effects are relatively insignificant. Near T_{c}, fluctuations play a particularly pronounced role in high-T_{c} superconductors. For this regime, Bulaevskii, Ledvij, and Kogan[5] and Kogan _et al._[6] have developed a theory incorporating such effects, which can complement other analyses in favorable cases.

In this study, we analyze the reversible magnetization of HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+8}, for both field orientations **H**\parallel_c_ and **H**\parallel_ab_, using the formalism of Hao-Clem. We evaluate the characteristic fields H_{c2}(T) and H_{c}(T) to obtain values (extrapolated to T\!=\!0) for the microscopic parameters \lambda(0) and \xi(0) using standard Ginzburg-Landau expressions. Finally, we corroborate some of these results by analyzing the equilibrium magnetization near T_{c} using two-dimensional (2D) scaling theory.[7]

## EXPERIMENTAL aspects

Bulk samples of HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+8} were prepared by a solid-state reaction from stoichiometric mixtures of 99.998% HgO, 99.997% BaO, 99.97% CaO, and 99.999% CuO as described previously.[8] X-ray diffraction indicates that >\!90% of the material comprise the desired three-layer Hg-cuprate phase. From these materials, an aligned composite sample was produced from monocrystallites of 7 \mum average size that were dispersed in "45 min" liquid epoxy and aligned in a 5 T field. The volume  fraction of superconductor in the epoxy matrix was about 9%. X-ray diffraction with the scattering vector parallel to the alignment field direction revealed strong (0_0l_) reflections, but no (_hkl_) reflections with nonzero indices h or k. The width of the rocking curve full width at half maximum was 2.6deg for the (006) line.

The magnetic properties were measured with a Quantum Design model MPMS-7 superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer. Scan lengths of 3 cm were used to maintain a field uniformity of < 0.005% in the 7 T magnet during measurement. Before application of the magnetic field, the temperature was stabilized to within +-0.05 K of the target temperature. Measurements of the isothermal magnetization _M_(_H_) were made for a set of temperature T between 5 and 140 K, with fields **H**\parallel_c_ and _H_\parallel_ab_ orientation. Before each new T setting, the sample was brought to a temperature well above _T_c and then cooled under zero applied field. Once the temperature was stabilized, the magnetic moment was measured at various applied magnetic fields H, increasing from 0.01 to 6.5 T and decreasing back to 0.01 T. After each field increment, the system paused for 10 sec to allow rapid instrumental transients to decay. In order to correct for magnetic background signals and obtain reliable information for the Hao-Clem analysis, the normal-state magnetic susceptibility was measured for temperature up to 250 K. A Curie-like behavior was found. After subtracting the background signal, the equilibrium (reversible) magnetic moment was determined as the mean value between field-increasing and -decreasing measurements. In most of the experimental range, however, both signals coincided since the (_T_,_H_) settings were mostly in the reversible region above the irreversibility line of the magnetic phase diagram.

The equilibrium magnetization _M_(_T_,_H_) of the sample was calculated as the reversible magnetic moment per unit of volume of superconductor. The superconducting volume was obtained by dividing the total mass of the sample by the x-ray density (in our case, 6.3 g/cm3). The process assumes that all of the HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} powder superconducts; the following results for the low-field susceptibility justify this assumption.

## EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Figure 1 shows the low-field dc susceptibility 4_p__X_, using a static measuring field of 4.0 Oe. Prior to these measurements, the magnet in the magnetometer was "reset" by heating it above its T_{c}, so that trapped magnetic flux in the windings was released. The data in Fig. 1 exhibit no significant structure, such as an additional signal near 95 K arising from a Hg-1201 impurity phase. The transition (10-90 %) is narrow for **H**\parallel_c_, which give a qualitative measure of the sample homogeneity. The conventional superconductive transition temperature T_{c}, defined by the low-field diamagnetic onset, is 133.5 K.

At low temperature, the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) susceptibility for **H**\parallel_c_ is 4_p__X_ = -0.94, corresponding to nearly complete screening of the grains interior; for **H**\parallel_ab_, the corresponding ZFC value is -0.26. In each case, the values have been corrected for demagnetizing effects using an effective demagnetizing factor D  1/3, as appropriate for a dilute array of roughly equiaxed particles.

When cooling from above T_{c} in the same 4 Oe applied field, we observed a large Meissner flux expulsion, with a field-cooled (FC) susceptibility 4_p__X_ = -0.76 for **H**\parallel_c_. This value, 76%, is a lower bound estimate for the true superconducting volume fraction. In this field configuration, the near surface of a grain is penetrated by the field to a depth ~_l__ab_, the London penetration depth for screening by supercurrent flow in the _ab_ direction. Considering the small particle size, which reduces the magnitude of the susceptibility, the observed 4_p__X_ implies that most (if not all) of the powder sample is superconducting, as assumed earlier. At 5 K, the corresponding FC value with **H**\parallel_ab_ was -0.17. Thus the ratio of susceptibilities at low temperature for different field directions, _kh_(_H_\parallel_c_)/_kh_(_H_\parallel_ab_), is 4.5 for the FC case and 3.6 for the ZFC case, respectively. Comparing the FC with the ZFC responses gives susceptibility r ratios _kh_(FC)/_kh_(ZFC) of 0.82 for **H**\parallel_c_ and 0.64 for **H**\parallel_ab_. Thus flux was trapped more strongly at low field with **H**\parallel_ab_.

Figure 2 shows experimental results for the magnetization M versus T near T_{c}, in various applied magnetic fields for both **H**\parallel_c_ and **H**\parallel_ab_. In a field of 1 T, the magnetization is reversible for temperatures above approximately 62 K for **H**\parallel_c_ and 95 K for **H**\parallel_ab_, respectively. We first analyze the data with **H**\parallel_c_, using the theory of Hao _et al_.2 This formalism relates H to B by accounting for the kinetic energy and the condensation energy terms arising from a suppression of the order parameter in vortex cores, which is neglected in the usual London model. Operationally, the diamagnetism _M_(_T_,_H_) is calculated numerically and fitted to the experimental data. The fitting procedure yields two important properties, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter _k_(_T_) = _l_/_g_ and the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(_T_). The product of these two gives H_{c2}(T) = \sqrt {2}\kappa(T)H_{c}(T), and _l_(_T_) and _g_(_T_) can be obtained, also.

The fitting procedure is as follows. For a fixed value of T within the reversible regime, the experimental values -4_p__M__i_/_H__i_ have to be compared with the theoretical ra

(20) and (21) of Ref. 2; here B^{\prime}\!=\!H^{\prime}\!+\!4\pi M^{\prime} and \kappa as adjustable parameters. Primes denote dimensionless units in which fields are measured in units of \sqrt[7]{2}H_{c}(T). The subindex i denotes values in different fields with T fixed. For each value of \kappa, there will be one solution B^{\prime}. From this, M^{\prime} and H^{\prime} are derived. The unit of magnetic field is determined from \sqrt[7]{2}H_{el}(T)\!=\!H_{i}/H^{\prime}\!=\!M_{i}/M^{\prime}. This has to be done for each data point i. If the value chosen for \kappa is not right, the resulting values for H_{ei} will not be constant (as they should be, since T is fixed). The best choice for \kappa gives the minimum variance in the set of values for H_{ei}(T). The resulting values for \kappa(T) at each temperature are shown in Fig. 3, for both field orientations.

In this analysis, the temperature range should extend not too far below T_{c} (since the system must be reversible), but not too close to T_{c} either, where the Ginzburg-Landau mean-field theory becomes invalid and superconducting fluctuations play an increasingly important role. In principle, \kappa should be almost constant, particularly near T_{c}; in practice, the best \kappa values increase with temperature and, for \mathbf{H}\|c, reach apparent values \kappa_{c}\!\approx\!400\!-\!600 near T_{c}, due to the fact that fluctuation effects are not included in the theoretical formalism. Fortunately, this material in its "as prepared" form has relatively weak vortex pinning and is reversible well below T_{c}, so we can work in a wide temperature range; see Fig. 3. The Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa_{c}\!=\!\lambda_{ab}/\xi_{ab} is nearly temperature independent, with average value 102 (H\|c), in the temperature range 84-112 K.

To illustrate the underlying theory, Fig. 4 shows the reduced (dimensionless) quantities M^{\prime} versus H^{\prime}, for HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} with \mathbf{H}\|c. The figure includes magnetization data (symbols) for a range of temperatures, all computed using the average value of the parameter \kappa_{c}. The theoretical model of Hao _et al._ (solid line) describes the experimental results well.

The other key information provided by the Hao-Clem analysis is the temperature-dependent thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(T), as shown in Fig. 5. We extrapolate these results to obtain the value H_{c}(0) at T\!=\!0 by fitting the BCS temperature dependence[9] for H_{c}(T),

\[\frac{H_{c}(T)}{H_{c}(0)}\!=\!1.7367\left[1\!-\!\frac{T}{T_{c}} \right]\left[1\!-\!0.2730\left[1\!-\!\frac{T}{T_{c}}\right]\right.\] \[\left.-0.0949\left[1\!-\!\frac{T}{T_{c}}\right]^{2}\right]\ .\] (1)

  The expression is valid for T/T_{c}\!>\!0.7, i.e., for T\!>\!\sim\!93 K, which is interval used. From this procedure, we obtain the result H_{c}(0)\!=\!9.3 kOe. The solid line in Fig. 5 is a plot of Eq. (1), fitted to the data (symbols). From H_{c}, we obtain the condensation energy density F_{c}\!=\!H_{c}^{2}/8\pi. This gives F_{c}(0)\!=\!0.34 J/cm^{3} at T\!=\!0, which is smaller than the value (0.45 J/cm^{3}) found [4] for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.

Let us now consider the field orientation {\bf H}\|ab. Again, the Hao-Clem analysis can be used, as described above. In this case, we impose the additional constraint that the condensation energy F_{c}\!=\!H_{c}^{2}/8\pi must be the same as with H\|c; certainly this thermodynamic quantity should be independent of orientation and field magnitude. The detailed values are shown in Fig. 3. Once again, \kappa is nearly independent of temperature up to \sim\!120 K, with an average value \kappa(H\|ab)\!\sim\!784.

From \kappa and H_{c}, one can obtain much useful information. For example, we construct the H_{c2}(T) lines near T_{c}, as shown in Fig. 6. An extrapolation to zero field intersects the horizontal axis at the respective values T_{c,H_{c2}} of 134.7 K for {\bf H}\|c and 133.9 K for {\bf H}\|ab. These values are (slightly) higher than the T_{c} onset of 133.5 K determined from the low-field susceptibility. In earlier studies on Tl-2223 and Hg-1201 superconductors, [10] similar effects were observed, but with a larger depression from the mean-field value as estimated from T_{c,H_{c2}}. These experimental results are consistent with the theoretical idea [11] that the mean-field T_{c} can be slightly higher than the experimentally observable T_{c} onset measured in small magnetic fields. Continuing then, Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg [12] have shown that the upper critical field H_{c2}(0) extrapolated to T\!=\!0 is proportional to the slope dH_{c2}/dT near T_{c} and is given by

\[H_{c2}(0)\!=\!-0.7T_{c}[dH_{c2}/dT]_{=T_{c}}\ .\] (2)

Thus we obtain the values H_{c2}^{H\|ab}(0)\!=\!149 T and H_{c2}^{H\|ab}(0)\!=\!1150 T, respectively. To estimate the coherence length at zero temperature, we use the GL expression H_{c2}(0)\!=\!\phi_{0}/2\pi\xi_{\rm eff}^{2}; here \xi_{\rm eff}^{2} is \xi_{ab}^{2} for {\bf H}\|c (ignoring ab plane anisotropy) and \xi_{ab}\xi_{c} for {\bf H}\|ab. The corresponding lengths are \xi_{ab}\!=\!15 A and \xi_{c}\!=\!1.9 A. In the latter case, the length is much smaller than the spacing "s" between trilayer sets, implying that the system should have substantial 2D character.

The derived quantities \xi(0), \lambda(0), and H_{c1}(0)\!=\!H_{c}\,{\rm ln}\kappa/(\sqrt{2}\kappa), as readily calculated from \kappa(0), H_{c}(0), and H_{c2}(0), are tabulated in Table 1. In the effective-mass approximation, [13] one has \lambda_{ab} and \lambda_{c} incorporated in an effective penetration depth for {\bf H}\|c and {\bf H}\|ab according to the following relations:

\[\lambda_{\rm eff}(H\|c)\!=\!\lambda_{ab},\ \ \lambda_{\rm eff}(H\|ab)\!=\! \sqrt{\lambda_{ab}\lambda_{c}}\ .\] (3)

We obtain the results \lambda_{ab}(0)\!=\!1700 A and \lambda_{\rm eff}(0)\!=\!4670 A with {\bf H}\|ab. Combining these gives the value \lambda_{c}(0)\!=\!13\,000 A.

Given the small values of \xi_{c}, it is reasonable to expect that the superconductive system is substantially two dimensional. For a 2D superconductor, theory predicts that the temperature and field dependence of physical quantities near T_{c} should scale in the variable t_{G}\!=\!g\!\{T\!-\!T_{c}(H)\}/(TH)^{1/2}, where g is a field- and temperature-independent function. [7, 14] Consequently, when M/(TH)^{1/2} is plotted versus t_{G}, then the mixed

  state data should collapse onto a single curve, independent of H. (In the 3D case, the functional model is similar except that the exponent \frac{1}{2} in the above expression is replaced by \frac{3}{2}.) The transition temperature T_{c}(H) can be taken as a linear function, with slope dH_{c2}/dT and intercept T_{c0} on the T axis. Adjusting the two parameters provides the 2D scaling shown in Fig. 7(a) (for {\bf H}\|c) and 7(b) (for {\bf H}\|ab). It is evident that the 2D model provides good scaling of the data. The resulting values for the slope dH_{c2}/dT are -1.8 T/K for {\bf H}\|c and -12.2 T/K for {\bf H}\|ab. These independent results compare well with the values from the Hao-Clem analysis given in Table 1.

## Discussion

The superconducting material HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} has a range of magnetic reversibility extending well below T_{c}. Consequently, it is relatively straightforward to apply thermodynamics to its magnetization, in the form of the Hao-Clem formulation. In this way, we have obtained useful information regarding this superconductor. We now consider some features and limitations of this study.

An interesting aspect of the magnetization data in Fig. 2 is that the mixed-state magnetization persists to temperature above the low-field diamagnetic onset T_{c}. This is due to vortex fluctuations, which give an entropic correction to the superconductive free energy that is particularly significant near T_{c}. As shown earlier by Tesanovic _et al._[14] and later by Bulaevskii, Ledvij, and Kogan _et al._,[6] the equilibrium magnetization M(T) exhibits a "crossing point" at which M is independent of field. In fact, the various curves in Fig. 2 cross at a characteristic temperature T^{*}\!=\!129.5 K. Unfortunately, we are not able in this case to make a reliable analysis using the fluctuation formalism. For example, the value of the crossing point magnetization M^{*} (for H\|c) is small. Theoretically, one has M^{*}\!=\!k_{B}T^{*}/\phi_{0}s, where "s"=16 A is the spacing between sets of CuO trilayers. Using this relation gives a calculated magnetization that is larger than the experimental value in Fig. 2 by a factor of 3. Previously, such an effect has been interpreted in terms of a superconducting volume fraction;[6] in fact, we found this interpretation to be consistent with the measured Meissner signal and the crystallographic phase abundance in Hg-1201 and Tl-2223 materials.[10] A parallel analysis here would imply that the superconducting volume fraction is only \sim\!30\%. However, this value is unphysical, being much smaller than either the low-field shielding signal or the Meissner signal. This discrepancy may originate from background effects near T_{c} where the overall signals are small and the corrections are significant. Alternatively, the effect may arise from some more fundamental (but as yet unidentified) limitation. Much further from T_{c} where we have applied the Hao-Clem formalism, the background signals are relatively smaller and more easily removed.

With data for the two orthogonal field orientations, one can establish some bounds on the superconductive anisotropy parameter \gamma\!=\!1/\epsilon. In an anisotropic London model,[13] this quantity is related to the components of the normalized mass tensor m_{i} (with i\!=\!1,3) as follows: \gamma^{2}\!=\!m_{3}/m_{1}\!=\!m_{1}^{-3}\!=\!m_{3}^{\,3/2} with m_{1}^{\,2}m_{3}\!=\!1. In terms of fundamental lengths, one has \gamma\!=\!\xi_{ab}/\xi_{c}\!=\!\lambda_{c}/\lambda_{ab}. From the data in Table 1, we obtain \gamma\!\geq\!7.7, which is larger than that observed (\gamma\!=\!5.5) in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, for example.[1, 15] We regard the present value as only a lower bound, since it directly depends on measurements with the field {\bf H}\|ab. For this approximate orientation, M changes very rapidly with angle, making the measurement quite sensitive to any macroscopic sample misalignment. Also, the angular spread in the alignment of crystallites, 2.6^{\circ} in this case, can be very significant when \gamma is large. Note, however, that M is _much_ less sensitive to angular deviations when the orientation is nearly {\bf H}\|c. Consequently, the results for the latter case are unaffected. An alternative estimate of the anisotropy parameter, \gamma\!\sim\!16, was obtained from an analysis of ac response studies[16] on random polycrystals of Hg-1223. From a study[17] of the irreversible properties of magnetically aligned Hg-1223, we obtained the estimate that \gamma\!\approx\!35\!-\!70, as based on a 2D to 3D crossover in the magnetic response with {\bf H}\|c. The crossover field is H_{\rm cr}\!\sim\!2 kOe, well below the fields used for the scaling analysis in Fig. 7. Consequently, it is internally consistent that the scaling follows the 2D model.

Finally, we note that the present value for \lambda_{ab}, as shown in Table 1, agrees well with the result of Bae

  _et al._[18] for grain-aligned Hg-1223 and is quite comparable with the value of 1500 A obtained by Huang _et al._[19] for polycrystalline Hg-1212. In both cases, the authors analyzed the equilibrium magnetization using the fluctuation formalism discussed above. These studies obtained \kappa values (H\|_c_) of \sim 60 and (77\pm13), respectively, which lie between the value \kappa \approx 50 for Hg-1201 (Ref. [10]) and our value of 100 for Hg-1223.

## Conclusions

Using the Hao-Clem theory, we have analyzed the equilibrium magnetization of a grain-aligned sample of the high-\kappa type-II superconductor HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+8}. With the magnetic field applied parallel to the c axis, we deduce that the slope of the upper critical field is - 1.6 T/K, the value of \kappa is 100, and the associated coherence length is \xi_{ab}(0) = 15 A. Comparison with the values for the case with H\|ab gives a lower bound estimate for the anisotropy parameter \gamma \geq 8. Two-dimensional scaling theory describes the measured M(H,T) well and yields slopes dH_{c2}/dT that coincide with those deduced from the Hao-Clem analysis.

# Abstract

The upper critical field H_{c2} and other equilibrium properties of a magnetically aligned HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+8} superconductor have been investigated. Experimental results for the reversible magnetization, both with **H**\parallel_c_ and **H**\parallel_ab_, are analyzed using the theoretical formalism of Hao _et al._ [Phys. Rev. B **43**, 2844 (1991)] for type-II superconductors. Near T_{c}, the slopes dH_{c2}/dT of the upper critical field are -1.6 T/K and -12.1 T/K for fields parallel and perpendicular to the c axis, respectively. These correspond to coherence lengths (extrapolated to T\!=\!0) of \xi_{ab}(0)\!=\!15 A and \xi_{c}\!=\!1.9 A. This gives a lower bound on the superconductive anisotropy parameter \gamma\!=\!(m_{c}/m_{ab})^{1/2}\!\geq\!8.

## Introduction

The equilibrium properties of high-T_{c} superconductors, such as the upper critical fields H_{c2} and the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}, are important, because they give relatively direct information about the microscopic parameters. These include the superconducting coherence length \xi and the magnetic penetration depth \lambda, particularly for the interesting case in which the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the CuO layers in the superconductors. Studies of aligned materials also can provide lower bound estimates for the degree of superconducting anisotropy.

In earlier analyses of dc magnetization measurements, Welp _et al._[1] obtained values for H_{c2} for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-8} by determining a nucleation temperature T_{c}(H). This temperature was constructed by linearly extrapolating the temperature-dependent reversible magnetization M in the superconducting state (with H\!=\!fixed) to the normal-state base line. Hao _et al._[2] pointed out, however, that much of the experimental magnetization data corresponded to fields H far below H_{c2}(T). Under these conditions, the usual linear relation between M and H near H_{c2}(T) [which follows from Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory[3]] does not adequately describe their functional relationship. Indeed, the experiments showed that the slopes dM/dT changed with field, confirming that simple linear relationships between M and H are not correct. As described below, Hao and Clem developed a more sophisticated theory that enables one to determine many fundamental properties of a superconductor from studies of the reversible magnetization in the intermediate-field region.[4] This formalism is most useful well below T_{c}, where fluctuation effects are relatively insignificant. Near T_{c}, fluctuations play a particularly pronounced role in high-T_{c} superconductors. For this regime, Bulaevskii, Ledvij, and Kogan[5] and Kogan _et al._[6] have developed a theory incorporating such effects, which can complement other analyses in favorable cases.

In this study, we analyze the reversible magnetization of HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+8}, for both field orientations **H**\parallel_c_ and **H**\parallel_ab_, using the formalism of Hao-Clem. We evaluate the characteristic fields H_{c2}(T) and H_{c}(T) to obtain values (extrapolated to T\!=\!0) for the microscopic parameters \lambda(0) and \xi(0) using standard Ginzburg-Landau expressions. Finally, we corroborate some of these results by analyzing the equilibrium magnetization near T_{c} using two-dimensional (2D) scaling theory.[7]

## EXPERIMENTAL aspects

Bulk samples of HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+8} were prepared by a solid-state reaction from stoichiometric mixtures of 99.998% HgO, 99.997% BaO, 99.97% CaO, and 99.999% CuO as described previously.[8] X-ray diffraction indicates that >\!90% of the material comprise the desired three-layer Hg-cuprate phase. From these materials, an aligned composite sample was produced from monocrystallites of 7 \mum average size that were dispersed in "45 min" liquid epoxy and aligned in a 5 T field. The volume  fraction of superconductor in the epoxy matrix was about 9%. X-ray diffraction with the scattering vector parallel to the alignment field direction revealed strong (0_0l_) reflections, but no (_hkl_) reflections with nonzero indices h or k. The width of the rocking curve full width at half maximum was 2.6deg for the (006) line.

The magnetic properties were measured with a Quantum Design model MPMS-7 superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer. Scan lengths of 3 cm were used to maintain a field uniformity of < 0.005% in the 7 T magnet during measurement. Before application of the magnetic field, the temperature was stabilized to within +-0.05 K of the target temperature. Measurements of the isothermal magnetization _M_(_H_) were made for a set of temperature T between 5 and 140 K, with fields **H**\parallel_c_ and _H_\parallel_ab_ orientation. Before each new T setting, the sample was brought to a temperature well above _T_c and then cooled under zero applied field. Once the temperature was stabilized, the magnetic moment was measured at various applied magnetic fields H, increasing from 0.01 to 6.5 T and decreasing back to 0.01 T. After each field increment, the system paused for 10 sec to allow rapid instrumental transients to decay. In order to correct for magnetic background signals and obtain reliable information for the Hao-Clem analysis, the normal-state magnetic susceptibility was measured for temperature up to 250 K. A Curie-like behavior was found. After subtracting the background signal, the equilibrium (reversible) magnetic moment was determined as the mean value between field-increasing and -decreasing measurements. In most of the experimental range, however, both signals coincided since the (_T_,_H_) settings were mostly in the reversible region above the irreversibility line of the magnetic phase diagram.

The equilibrium magnetization _M_(_T_,_H_) of the sample was calculated as the reversible magnetic moment per unit of volume of superconductor. The superconducting volume was obtained by dividing the total mass of the sample by the x-ray density (in our case, 6.3 g/cm3). The process assumes that all of the HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} powder superconducts; the following results for the low-field susceptibility justify this assumption.

## EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Figure 1 shows the low-field dc susceptibility 4_p__X_, using a static measuring field of 4.0 Oe. Prior to these measurements, the magnet in the magnetometer was "reset" by heating it above its T_{c}, so that trapped magnetic flux in the windings was released. The data in Fig. 1 exhibit no significant structure, such as an additional signal near 95 K arising from a Hg-1201 impurity phase. The transition (10-90 %) is narrow for **H**\parallel_c_, which give a qualitative measure of the sample homogeneity. The conventional superconductive transition temperature T_{c}, defined by the low-field diamagnetic onset, is 133.5 K.

At low temperature, the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) susceptibility for **H**\parallel_c_ is 4_p__X_ = -0.94, corresponding to nearly complete screening of the grains interior; for **H**\parallel_ab_, the corresponding ZFC value is -0.26. In each case, the values have been corrected for demagnetizing effects using an effective demagnetizing factor D  1/3, as appropriate for a dilute array of roughly equiaxed particles.

When cooling from above T_{c} in the same 4 Oe applied field, we observed a large Meissner flux expulsion, with a field-cooled (FC) susceptibility 4_p__X_ = -0.76 for **H**\parallel_c_. This value, 76%, is a lower bound estimate for the true superconducting volume fraction. In this field configuration, the near surface of a grain is penetrated by the field to a depth ~_l__ab_, the London penetration depth for screening by supercurrent flow in the _ab_ direction. Considering the small particle size, which reduces the magnitude of the susceptibility, the observed 4_p__X_ implies that most (if not all) of the powder sample is superconducting, as assumed earlier. At 5 K, the corresponding FC value with **H**\parallel_ab_ was -0.17. Thus the ratio of susceptibilities at low temperature for different field directions, _kh_(_H_\parallel_c_)/_kh_(_H_\parallel_ab_), is 4.5 for the FC case and 3.6 for the ZFC case, respectively. Comparing the FC with the ZFC responses gives susceptibility r ratios _kh_(FC)/_kh_(ZFC) of 0.82 for **H**\parallel_c_ and 0.64 for **H**\parallel_ab_. Thus flux was trapped more strongly at low field with **H**\parallel_ab_.

Figure 2 shows experimental results for the magnetization M versus T near T_{c}, in various applied magnetic fields for both **H**\parallel_c_ and **H**\parallel_ab_. In a field of 1 T, the magnetization is reversible for temperatures above approximately 62 K for **H**\parallel_c_ and 95 K for **H**\parallel_ab_, respectively. We first analyze the data with **H**\parallel_c_, using the theory of Hao _et al_.2 This formalism relates H to B by accounting for the kinetic energy and the condensation energy terms arising from a suppression of the order parameter in vortex cores, which is neglected in the usual London model. Operationally, the diamagnetism _M_(_T_,_H_) is calculated numerically and fitted to the experimental data. The fitting procedure yields two important properties, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter _k_(_T_) = _l_/_g_ and the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(_T_). The product of these two gives H_{c2}(T) = \sqrt {2}\kappa(T)H_{c}(T), and _l_(_T_) and _g_(_T_) can be obtained, also.

The fitting procedure is as follows. For a fixed value of T within the reversible regime, the experimental values -4_p__M__i_/_H__i_ have to be compared with the theoretical ra

(20) and (21) of Ref. 2; here B^{\prime}\!=\!H^{\prime}\!+\!4\pi M^{\prime} and \kappa as adjustable parameters. Primes denote dimensionless units in which fields are measured in units of \sqrt[7]{2}H_{c}(T). The subindex i denotes values in different fields with T fixed. For each value of \kappa, there will be one solution B^{\prime}. From this, M^{\prime} and H^{\prime} are derived. The unit of magnetic field is determined from \sqrt[7]{2}H_{el}(T)\!=\!H_{i}/H^{\prime}\!=\!M_{i}/M^{\prime}. This has to be done for each data point i. If the value chosen for \kappa is not right, the resulting values for H_{ei} will not be constant (as they should be, since T is fixed). The best choice for \kappa gives the minimum variance in the set of values for H_{ei}(T). The resulting values for \kappa(T) at each temperature are shown in Fig. 3, for both field orientations.

In this analysis, the temperature range should extend not too far below T_{c} (since the system must be reversible), but not too close to T_{c} either, where the Ginzburg-Landau mean-field theory becomes invalid and superconducting fluctuations play an increasingly important role. In principle, \kappa should be almost constant, particularly near T_{c}; in practice, the best \kappa values increase with temperature and, for \mathbf{H}\|c, reach apparent values \kappa_{c}\!\approx\!400\!-\!600 near T_{c}, due to the fact that fluctuation effects are not included in the theoretical formalism. Fortunately, this material in its "as prepared" form has relatively weak vortex pinning and is reversible well below T_{c}, so we can work in a wide temperature range; see Fig. 3. The Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa_{c}\!=\!\lambda_{ab}/\xi_{ab} is nearly temperature independent, with average value 102 (H\|c), in the temperature range 84-112 K.

To illustrate the underlying theory, Fig. 4 shows the reduced (dimensionless) quantities M^{\prime} versus H^{\prime}, for HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} with \mathbf{H}\|c. The figure includes magnetization data (symbols) for a range of temperatures, all computed using the average value of the parameter \kappa_{c}. The theoretical model of Hao _et al._ (solid line) describes the experimental results well.

The other key information provided by the Hao-Clem analysis is the temperature-dependent thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(T), as shown in Fig. 5. We extrapolate these results to obtain the value H_{c}(0) at T\!=\!0 by fitting the BCS temperature dependence[9] for H_{c}(T),

\[\frac{H_{c}(T)}{H_{c}(0)}\!=\!1.7367\left[1\!-\!\frac{T}{T_{c}} \right]\left[1\!-\!0.2730\left[1\!-\!\frac{T}{T_{c}}\right]\right.\] \[\left.-0.0949\left[1\!-\!\frac{T}{T_{c}}\right]^{2}\right]\ .\] (1)

Figure 3: GL parameter \kappa_{c}(H\|c) and \kappa_{el}(\mathbf{H}\|ab) as a function of temperature from Hao-Clem analysis.

  The expression is valid for T/T_{c}\!>\!0.7, i.e., for T\!>\!\sim\!93 K, which is interval used. From this procedure, we obtain the result H_{c}(0)\!=\!9.3 kOe. The solid line in Fig. 5 is a plot of Eq. (1), fitted to the data (symbols). From H_{c}, we obtain the condensation energy density F_{c}\!=\!H_{c}^{2}/8\pi. This gives F_{c}(0)\!=\!0.34 J/cm^{3} at T\!=\!0, which is smaller than the value (0.45 J/cm^{3}) found [4] for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.

Let us now consider the field orientation {\bf H}\|ab. Again, the Hao-Clem analysis can be used, as described above. In this case, we impose the additional constraint that the condensation energy F_{c}\!=\!H_{c}^{2}/8\pi must be the same as with H\|c; certainly this thermodynamic quantity should be independent of orientation and field magnitude. The detailed values are shown in Fig. 3. Once again, \kappa is nearly independent of temperature up to \sim\!120 K, with an average value \kappa(H\|ab)\!\sim\!784.

From \kappa and H_{c}, one can obtain much useful information. For example, we construct the H_{c2}(T) lines near T_{c}, as shown in Fig. 6. An extrapolation to zero field intersects the horizontal axis at the respective values T_{c,H_{c2}} of 134.7 K for {\bf H}\|c and 133.9 K for {\bf H}\|ab. These values are (slightly) higher than the T_{c} onset of 133.5 K determined from the low-field susceptibility. In earlier studies on Tl-2223 and Hg-1201 superconductors, [10] similar effects were observed, but with a larger depression from the mean-field value as estimated from T_{c,H_{c2}}. These experimental results are consistent with the theoretical idea [11] that the mean-field T_{c} can be slightly higher than the experimentally observable T_{c} onset measured in small magnetic fields. Continuing then, Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg [12] have shown that the upper critical field H_{c2}(0) extrapolated to T\!=\!0 is proportional to the slope dH_{c2}/dT near T_{c} and is given by

\[H_{c2}(0)\!=\!-0.7T_{c}[dH_{c2}/dT]_{=T_{c}}\ .\] (2)

Thus we obtain the values H_{c2}^{H\|ab}(0)\!=\!149 T and H_{c2}^{H\|ab}(0)\!=\!1150 T, respectively. To estimate the coherence length at zero temperature, we use the GL expression H_{c2}(0)\!=\!\phi_{0}/2\pi\xi_{\rm eff}^{2}; here \xi_{\rm eff}^{2} is \xi_{ab}^{2} for {\bf H}\|c (ignoring ab plane anisotropy) and \xi_{ab}\xi_{c} for {\bf H}\|ab. The corresponding lengths are \xi_{ab}\!=\!15 A and \xi_{c}\!=\!1.9 A. In the latter case, the length is much smaller than the spacing "s" between trilayer sets, implying that the system should have substantial 2D character.

The derived quantities \xi(0), \lambda(0), and H_{c1}(0)\!=\!H_{c}\,{\rm ln}\kappa/(\sqrt{2}\kappa), as readily calculated from \kappa(0), H_{c}(0), and H_{c2}(0), are tabulated in Table 1. In the effective-mass approximation, [13] one has \lambda_{ab} and \lambda_{c} incorporated in an effective penetration depth for {\bf H}\|c and {\bf H}\|ab according to the following relations:

\[\lambda_{\rm eff}(H\|c)\!=\!\lambda_{ab},\ \ \lambda_{\rm eff}(H\|ab)\!=\! \sqrt{\lambda_{ab}\lambda_{c}}\ .\] (3)

We obtain the results \lambda_{ab}(0)\!=\!1700 A and \lambda_{\rm eff}(0)\!=\!4670 A with {\bf H}\|ab. Combining these gives the value \lambda_{c}(0)\!=\!13\,000 A.

Given the small values of \xi_{c}, it is reasonable to expect that the superconductive system is substantially two dimensional. For a 2D superconductor, theory predicts that the temperature and field dependence of physical quantities near T_{c} should scale in the variable t_{G}\!=\!g\!\{T\!-\!T_{c}(H)\}/(TH)^{1/2}, where g is a field- and temperature-independent function. [7, 14] Consequently, when M/(TH)^{1/2} is plotted versus t_{G}, then the mixed

  state data should collapse onto a single curve, independent of H. (In the 3D case, the functional model is similar except that the exponent \frac{1}{2} in the above expression is replaced by \frac{3}{2}.) The transition temperature T_{c}(H) can be taken as a linear function, with slope dH_{c2}/dT and intercept T_{c0} on the T axis. Adjusting the two parameters provides the 2D scaling shown in Fig. 7(a) (for {\bf H}\|c) and 7(b) (for {\bf H}\|ab). It is evident that the 2D model provides good scaling of the data. The resulting values for the slope dH_{c2}/dT are -1.8 T/K for {\bf H}\|c and -12.2 T/K for {\bf H}\|ab. These independent results compare well with the values from the Hao-Clem analysis given in Table 1.

## Discussion

The superconducting material HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} has a range of magnetic reversibility extending well below T_{c}. Consequently, it is relatively straightforward to apply thermodynamics to its magnetization, in the form of the Hao-Clem formulation. In this way, we have obtained useful information regarding this superconductor. We now consider some features and limitations of this study.

An interesting aspect of the magnetization data in Fig. 2 is that the mixed-state magnetization persists to temperature above the low-field diamagnetic onset T_{c}. This is due to vortex fluctuations, which give an entropic correction to the superconductive free energy that is particularly significant near T_{c}. As shown earlier by Tesanovic _et al._[14] and later by Bulaevskii, Ledvij, and Kogan _et al._,[6] the equilibrium magnetization M(T) exhibits a "crossing point" at which M is independent of field. In fact, the various curves in Fig. 2 cross at a characteristic temperature T^{*}\!=\!129.5 K. Unfortunately, we are not able in this case to make a reliable analysis using the fluctuation formalism. For example, the value of the crossing point magnetization M^{*} (for H\|c) is small. Theoretically, one has M^{*}\!=\!k_{B}T^{*}/\phi_{0}s, where "s"=16 A is the spacing between sets of CuO trilayers. Using this relation gives a calculated magnetization that is larger than the experimental value in Fig. 2 by a factor of 3. Previously, such an effect has been interpreted in terms of a superconducting volume fraction;[6] in fact, we found this interpretation to be consistent with the measured Meissner signal and the crystallographic phase abundance in Hg-1201 and Tl-2223 materials.[10] A parallel analysis here would imply that the superconducting volume fraction is only \sim\!30\%. However, this value is unphysical, being much smaller than either the low-field shielding signal or the Meissner signal. This discrepancy may originate from background effects near T_{c} where the overall signals are small and the corrections are significant. Alternatively, the effect may arise from some more fundamental (but as yet unidentified) limitation. Much further from T_{c} where we have applied the Hao-Clem formalism, the background signals are relatively smaller and more easily removed.

With data for the two orthogonal field orientations, one can establish some bounds on the superconductive anisotropy parameter \gamma\!=\!1/\epsilon. In an anisotropic London model,[13] this quantity is related to the components of the normalized mass tensor m_{i} (with i\!=\!1,3) as follows: \gamma^{2}\!=\!m_{3}/m_{1}\!=\!m_{1}^{-3}\!=\!m_{3}^{\,3/2} with m_{1}^{\,2}m_{3}\!=\!1. In terms of fundamental lengths, one has \gamma\!=\!\xi_{ab}/\xi_{c}\!=\!\lambda_{c}/\lambda_{ab}. From the data in Table 1, we obtain \gamma\!\geq\!7.7, which is larger than that observed (\gamma\!=\!5.5) in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, for example.[1, 15] We regard the present value as only a lower bound, since it directly depends on measurements with the field {\bf H}\|ab. For this approximate orientation, M changes very rapidly with angle, making the measurement quite sensitive to any macroscopic sample misalignment. Also, the angular spread in the alignment of crystallites, 2.6^{\circ} in this case, can be very significant when \gamma is large. Note, however, that M is _much_ less sensitive to angular deviations when the orientation is nearly {\bf H}\|c. Consequently, the results for the latter case are unaffected. An alternative estimate of the anisotropy parameter, \gamma\!\sim\!16, was obtained from an analysis of ac response studies[16] on random polycrystals of Hg-1223. From a study[17] of the irreversible properties of magnetically aligned Hg-1223, we obtained the estimate that \gamma\!\approx\!35\!-\!70, as based on a 2D to 3D crossover in the magnetic response with {\bf H}\|c. The crossover field is H_{\rm cr}\!\sim\!2 kOe, well below the fields used for the scaling analysis in Fig. 7. Consequently, it is internally consistent that the scaling follows the 2D model.

Finally, we note that the present value for \lambda_{ab}, as shown in Table 1, agrees well with the result of Bae

  _et al._[18] for grain-aligned Hg-1223 and is quite comparable with the value of 1500 A obtained by Huang _et al._[19] for polycrystalline Hg-1212. In both cases, the authors analyzed the equilibrium magnetization using the fluctuation formalism discussed above. These studies obtained \kappa values (H\|_c_) of \sim 60 and (77\pm13), respectively, which lie between the value \kappa \approx 50 for Hg-1201 (Ref. [10]) and our value of 100 for Hg-1223.

## Conclusions

Using the Hao-Clem theory, we have analyzed the equilibrium magnetization of a grain-aligned sample of the high-\kappa type-II superconductor HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+8}. With the magnetic field applied parallel to the c axis, we deduce that the slope of the upper critical field is - 1.6 T/K, the value of \kappa is 100, and the associated coherence length is \xi_{ab}(0) = 15 A. Comparison with the values for the case with H\|ab gives a lower bound estimate for the anisotropy parameter \gamma \geq 8. Two-dimensional scaling theory describes the measured M(H,T) well and yields slopes dH_{c2}/dT that coincide with those deduced from the Hao-Clem analysis.
