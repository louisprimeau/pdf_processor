###### Abstract

The synthesis and structural and physical properties of iron lanthanide oxypnictide superconductors, L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Pr, Sm, Gd), with transition temperature at \sim25 K are reported. Single crystals have been grown at high pressure using the cubic anvil technique. The crystal structure consists of layers of L_{2}O_{2} tetrahedra separated by alternating layers of chains of Te and of Fe_{2}As_{2} tetrahedra: L_{2}O_{2}-Te-L_{2}O_{2}-Fe_{2}As_{2}-L_{2}O_{2}-Te-L_{2}O_{2}- (space group: _1A/mmm_, a\sim 4.0,c\sim 29.6 A). Substitution of oxygen by fluorine increases the critical temperature, e.g., in Gd_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y} up to 45 K. Magnetic torque measurements reveal an anisotropy of the penetration depths of \sim31.

## I Introduction

The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x}[1] has spiraled up an investigation of a variety of compounds consisting of M_{2}As_{2} (M is a transition metal) layers alternating with L_{2}O_{2} (L is a lanthanide metal) layers or metal layers (e.g., Ba, Li, or other). In view of the fact that all of these compounds were reported already before discovery of superconductivity in La1111 [2,3], and their synthesis procedure as well as structure details were well investigated, great progress in finding several new iron-based superconductors was achieved by doping of known layered pnictides and oxypnictides in less than one year. Superconductivity was also found in FeSe or "11" (T_{c} = 8 K) [4,5], Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} or "122" (T_{c} = 38 K) [6,7], LiFeAs or "111" (T_{c} = 18 K) [8,9], and La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2} or "3442" (T_{c} = 2.2 K) [10,11].

In this paper, we present the systematic study of superconducting compounds L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Pr, Sm, Gd) with a hitherto unknown structure. Our recent work [12], where crystal growth, structure, and physical properties of an oxypnictide superconductor Pr_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} with a critical temperature (T_{c}) close to 25 K were reported, triggered this study with the intention of increasing T_{c} of this compound.

The structure of Pr_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (also called 42214) reveals the same structural blocks as the PrFeAsO (1111) oxypnictide superconductor [3]: fluorite-type Pr_{2}O_{2} layers alternating with anti-fluorite-type Fe_{2}As_{2} layers with a difference in the presence of intercalated Te atoms [Fig. 1(a)-1(c)]. Both structures are tetragonal with the space group _1A/mmm_ for the former and P4/mmm_ for the latter.

For the 1111 phase, two parameters are known to increase T_{c} by modifying the structure or composition. One of them is pnictogen height h_{P} (half of the thickness of the Fe_{2}As_{2} or S_{2}, [Fig. 1(a)-1(c)], which, as an indicator for highest possible T_{c}, should be close to 1.38 A [13,14]. The LFeAsO for L = Sm and Gd have h_{P} values close to the "optimal" one.

The other factor is doping. The pure stoichiometric, undoped 1111 phase does not reveal superconductivity [1]. The most effective doping that results in T_{c} above 50 K is at the oxygen sites, either by fluorine, hydrogen, or by oxygen vacancies [1,15,16]. Substitution of Sm by Th also leads to T_{c} above 50 K [17,18].

According to our recent investigations [12,19], the lattice constants a and b, Fe_{2}As_{2} layer thickness S_{2}, and Fe_{2}As_{2}-L_{2}O_{2} interlayer distance S_{3} are almost equal for both PrFeAsO and for Pr_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (Fig. 1(a)-1(c)). In analogy to 1111, one can expect that "optimal" h_{P} and proper doping should lead to high T_{c} in 42214 compounds. L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Sm and Gd) doped with fluorine, as one of the options, was assumed to be the ideal candidate for increasing T_{c} at 42214 because h_{P} of LFeAsO (L = Sm, Gd) corresponds to the maximal T_{c}. To prove this suggestion, a detailed structural study of undoped L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Pr, Sm, Gd) was performed, and the influence of fluorine substitution for oxygen on T_{c} in L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Sm, Gd) was studied.

Here, we report on the high-pressure crystal growth, structure, and doping of L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y} (L = Pr, Sm, Gd) single crystals. The critical temperature of Gd42214 single crystals increased after F doping from 25 K up to 45 K.

## II Experimental details

The crystals of Pr_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4}, Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y}, and Gd_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y} were grown at high pressure from precursors (presitened mixture of 0.9PrAs + 0.1PrTe + FeO, 0.9SmAs + 0.1TeO_{2} + 0.5FeO + 0.15FeF_{2} + 0.35Fe + 0.1Sm and Fe + 0.9GdAs + 0.1GdTe + 0.8FeO + 0.1FeF_{2}, respectively) in NaCl/KCl flux. The procedure is described by Katrych _et al._[12]. The same procedure was used for the growth of L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Sm, Gd) crystals from stoichiometric mixture of high-purity (\geqslant99.95%) L, LAs, FeO, and TeO_{2}.

The single crystals were studied on a three-circle x-ray diffractometer equipped with a CCD detector (Bruker AXS Inc.). Data reduction and multiscan absorption correction were performed using the APEx2[20] and SAINT[21] software. The crystal structure was solved by a direct method, and the full  data set was refined on F^{2}, employing the programs shellXS-97 [22] and shellxl-97 [23].

The magnetization as a function of temperature has been measured for individual single crystals of L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{7}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Pr, Gd) and L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-x}F_{y} (L = Sm, Gd) doped with fluorine. These experiments have been done with a magnetic property measurement system (MPMS) with enhanced sensitivity (MPMS-XL).

Because individual Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} single crystals were too small, the magnetic susceptibility \chi_{\rho} measurement was performed on a powdered sample using an MPMS (Quantum Design) under zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) conditions.

The electrical resistivity (\rho) of a Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-x}F_{y} single crystal was measured as a function of temperature using a standard four-probe method. Gold wires of 12 \mum diameter were glued with silver paint on a 150-\mum-long sample in a van der Pauw geometry. The contact resistance was less than 200 \Omega. A sensing current of 100 \muA was generated using a Keithley 220 programmable current source, and the resulting signal was measured by a Keithley 2182 nanovoltmeter. The sample was cooled in a liquid helium bath cryostat from room temperature at a rate of 0.5 K/min.

The magnetic anisotropy measurements were carried out with a homemade magnetic torque sensor [24]. A tiny Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-x}F_{y} single crystal (\sim100 \times 100 \times 10 \mum^{3}) was fixed on a platform hanging on piezoresistive legs. When a static magnetic field was applied to this anisotropic superconductor, a torque proportional to the vector product of magnetization and field appears and bends the piezoresistive legs. The resulting change in resistance can be read out electronically, yielding a signal proportional to the torque [24].

  

## III Results and Discussion

### Structure analysis

The crystals of Pr_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} with plate-like shape reveal nice quality with a mosaic spread of \sim1.1^{\circ} (Fig. 2).

Structure of 42214 (Fig. 1(a)) was determined and refined on the base of 670 independent reflections. Since the displacement parameter of Te was larger than that of other atoms, the occupation parameter for it was set as a free variable. Finally, the Te site reveals about 10% of vacancies [12]. The same Te deficiency was found in L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L= Sm, Gd), which was refined using the Pr_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} structural model. Table 1 and Table 2 provide the results of structure determination and refinement.

Despite the entirely different stoichiometric composition or formula type, the determined structure has some resemblance to that of La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}[10], or another representative of its structure type, superconducting La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}[344] [11]. The number of atoms in the unit cells as well as the space group are the same (Pearson symbol: t/26, space-group:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c} Atom & Site & x & y & z & L= Pr/Sm/Gd & U_{iso} & U_{11}=U_{22} & U_{33} \\ \hline L_{1} & 4e & \nu_{2} & \nu_{2} & 0.0684(1)/0.0690(1)/0.0693(1) & 9(1)/7(1)/8(1) & 8(1)/6(1)/6(1) & 11(1)/8(1)/1(1) \\ L_{2} & 4e & 0 & 0 & 0.1480(1)/0 _14/mmm_). Like in 3442, the structure of 42214 consists of stacked fluorite-type L_{2}O_{2} and anti-fluorite-type M_{2}Pn_{2} layers. However, the sequence and numbers of the two types of layers are dissimilar for the two structures; furthermore, the atom in the center of the unit cell has a positive charge L^{k+} for 3442 and negative charge Te^{\delta-} for 42214. The two structures are isoconfigurational and have interchanged corresponding structure motifs: (L_{2}O_{2})_{2}(M_{2}Pn_{2})Te vs (L_{2}O_{2})(M_{2}Pn_{2})_{2}_{2}

  (Fig. 1(a)-1(c)), where L = Pr, Sm, Gd, and M = Fe, and Pn = As for the former and L = La, Ce, Nd, and M = Cu, Ni, and Pn = P for the latter. Regarding the definition from Lima-de-Faria _et al._[25], the 42214 structure could be considered as an _anti_-La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{2}O_{2}-crystal structure.

The 3442 phase is considered as an ordered mixture of L_M_PnO and L_M_2Pn_{2}[11] (Fig. 2(c)-2(d)). The 42214 could be described as stacking of the 1111 structure with L_{2}O_{2}Te [26] (Fig. 1(a)-1(c)).

Across the lanthanide series, with increasing atomic number in the periodic table and decreasing covalent radius lattice constants, the thickness of the Pr_{2}O_{2} layer, S_{1}, decreases while the thickness of the Fe_{2}As_{2} layer, S_{2} (2 \timesh_{P}), increases (Fig. 3). The corresponding S_{2} and S_{3} layers are very close for both 1111 and 42214 structures [19] (Table I; Fig. 1(a)-1(c)), while the L_{2}O_{2} (S_{1}) layer is thicker in 1111 by 0.1 A. The h_{P} parameter increases monotonically from 1.332 to 1.366 A and is getting, as was expected, close to the "optimal" value for Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O and Gd_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O (1.352(3) and 1.366(3) A, respectively.

The fluorine-doped crystals of Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y} and Gd_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y} were also studied by single-crystal x-ray diffraction. The results are shown in Tables 3 and 4. In both cases, the lattice parameter c is smaller than for samples without fluorine. For Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y}, c is much smaller, which could be caused by a high concentration of tellurium deficiency (about 28 at%). The lattice constants a and b for Gd_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y} remain almost the same as for the sample without fluorine. For Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y}, a and b are slightly smaller in comparison to Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4}. It is rather difficult to find any correlation or exact influence of fluorine doping with the lattice geometry because of different concentrations of vacancies in the Te site for each sample, as well as because of difficulties with estimation of the real fluorine content.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c} Atom & Site & x & y & zL = Sm/Gd & U_{iso} & U_{11} = U_{22} & U_{33} \\ \hline L_{1} & 4e & \% & \% & 0.0683(1)/0.0692(1) & 10(1)/8(1) & 8(1)/6(1) & 13(1)/11(1) \\ L_{2} & 4e & 0 & 0 & 0.1479(1)/0.1476(1) & 10(1)  for two small individual single crystals of L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Pr, Gd) is shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. The m/H(T) measurements for single crystals have been performed in various magnetic fields parallel to the c axis, for the ZFC and FC states. The observed signal reveals bulk superconductivity [12]. Magnetic measurements performed on the Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} powdered sample at an applied field of 0.5 mT showed the onset of superconducting transition at \sim25 K, with a relatively small superconducting shielding fraction (9.4%; see the ZFC curve in Fig. 4, where the density of the compound was calculated to be 7.48 g/cm^{3}). The powdered sample was not single phase.

The onset of the superconducting transition for the Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} sample as well as for both single crystals of L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Pr, Gd) is estimated to be nearly the same, T_{c}\sim 25 K (Figs. 4-5). The omnipresent Te deficiency could be assumed as a doping causing superconductivity. The application of small magnetic fields above 1 mT already leads to a drastic broadening of the transition width, indicative of a very small lower critical field, H_{c1}.

#### iii.3.2 Samples with Te deficiency and doped with fluorine

In Figure 6, the result of fluorine doping can be seen. Figure 6(a) shows m(T) for the ZFC and FC states of a single crystal of Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{0.72(1)}O_{4-x}F_{y}. After substituting nominally 30% of oxygen by fluorine, T_{c} increased from 25 K to 40 K. Figure 6(b) shows m(T) for a Gd_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{0.92(1)}O_{4-y}F_{y} single crystal. Here, substitution of nominally 20% of oxygen by fluorine increased T_{c} up to 45 K. It is not clear if maximum T_{c} has been obtained. Doping dependence on T_{c} should be investigated in a broader range of compositions.

### Transport measurement

The onset superconducting critical temperature is 36 K for Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y} (Fig. 7). The \rho-T curve suggests that the sample is not optimally doped and that some inhomogeneity is present in the structure. This might explain the small upturn in \rho just above the superconducting transition.

### Magnetic torque studies

Figure 8 shows the torque as a function of the angle \theta between the applied magnetic field H and the crystallographic c axis. When the field direction is swept clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW), a hysteresis between the CW and CCW torque curves appears. This is due to the pinning of the vortices on crystal defects [27]. The data shown here are the average of the CW and CCW curves.

The angular torque data are analyzed with the Kogan model [28], which allows the anisotropy \gamma of the material to be extracted. The anisotropy parameter \gamma is defined as \lambda_{c}/\lambda_{ab}, where \lambda_{i} is the magnetic field penetration depth for a field along the crystallographic i axis. The fit is done assuming a Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg [29] dependence of the upper critical field, with a slope at T_{c} given in Ref. [12].

The fit results in a rather high anisotropy of 31, measured at 25 K. This anisotropy is one of the highest among the iron-based superconductor family, consistent with the large distance between the superconducting Fe_{2}As_{2} layers in this material.

## IV Conclusion

Single crystals of layered superconductors L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Pr, Sm, Gd; x\sim 0.1) were grown using the high-pressure cubic anvil technique. The structure reveals the stacking of anti-fluorite-type M_{2}Pn_{2} and fluorite-type L_{2}O_{2} layers, alternating with the chain of tellurium atoms, and it could be considered as an anti-La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}-crystal structure. The critical temperature T_{c} is about 25 K and does not show any dependence on the kind of lanthanide atom.

The solid line denotes a fit according to the Kogan model from which the anisotropy parameter \gamma = 31 was extracted.

Doping with fluorine increases T_{c} of \mathrm{Sm}_{4}\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{1-x}\mathrm{O}_{4-y} \mathrm{F}_{y} up to 40 K and that of \mathrm{Gd}_{4}\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{1-x}\mathrm{O}_{4-y} \mathrm{F}_{y} up to 45 K. For determination of maximum T_{c} of 42214, more detailed studies of T_{c} dependence on doping are necessary.

###### Abstract

The synthesis and structural and physical properties of iron lanthanide oxypnictide superconductors, L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Pr, Sm, Gd), with transition temperature at \sim25 K are reported. Single crystals have been grown at high pressure using the cubic anvil technique. The crystal structure consists of layers of L_{2}O_{2} tetrahedra separated by alternating layers of chains of Te and of Fe_{2}As_{2} tetrahedra: L_{2}O_{2}-Te-L_{2}O_{2}-Fe_{2}As_{2}-L_{2}O_{2}-Te-L_{2}O_{2}- (space group: _1A/mmm_, a\sim 4.0,c\sim 29.6 A). Substitution of oxygen by fluorine increases the critical temperature, e.g., in Gd_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y} up to 45 K. Magnetic torque measurements reveal an anisotropy of the penetration depths of \sim31.

## I Introduction

The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x}[1] has spiraled up an investigation of a variety of compounds consisting of M_{2}As_{2} (M is a transition metal) layers alternating with L_{2}O_{2} (L is a lanthanide metal) layers or metal layers (e.g., Ba, Li, or other). In view of the fact that all of these compounds were reported already before discovery of superconductivity in La1111 [2,3], and their synthesis procedure as well as structure details were well investigated, great progress in finding several new iron-based superconductors was achieved by doping of known layered pnictides and oxypnictides in less than one year. Superconductivity was also found in FeSe or "11" (T_{c} = 8 K) [4,5], Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} or "122" (T_{c} = 38 K) [6,7], LiFeAs or "111" (T_{c} = 18 K) [8,9], and La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2} or "3442" (T_{c} = 2.2 K) [10,11].

In this paper, we present the systematic study of superconducting compounds L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Pr, Sm, Gd) with a hitherto unknown structure. Our recent work [12], where crystal growth, structure, and physical properties of an oxypnictide superconductor Pr_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} with a critical temperature (T_{c}) close to 25 K were reported, triggered this study with the intention of increasing T_{c} of this compound.

The structure of Pr_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (also called 42214) reveals the same structural blocks as the PrFeAsO (1111) oxypnictide superconductor [3]: fluorite-type Pr_{2}O_{2} layers alternating with anti-fluorite-type Fe_{2}As_{2} layers with a difference in the presence of intercalated Te atoms [Fig. 1(a)-1(c)]. Both structures are tetragonal with the space group _1A/mmm_ for the former and P4/mmm_ for the latter.

For the 1111 phase, two parameters are known to increase T_{c} by modifying the structure or composition. One of them is pnictogen height h_{P} (half of the thickness of the Fe_{2}As_{2} or S_{2}, [Fig. 1(a)-1(c)], which, as an indicator for highest possible T_{c}, should be close to 1.38 A [13,14]. The LFeAsO for L = Sm and Gd have h_{P} values close to the "optimal" one.

The other factor is doping. The pure stoichiometric, undoped 1111 phase does not reveal superconductivity [1]. The most effective doping that results in T_{c} above 50 K is at the oxygen sites, either by fluorine, hydrogen, or by oxygen vacancies [1,15,16]. Substitution of Sm by Th also leads to T_{c} above 50 K [17,18].

According to our recent investigations [12,19], the lattice constants a and b, Fe_{2}As_{2} layer thickness S_{2}, and Fe_{2}As_{2}-L_{2}O_{2} interlayer distance S_{3} are almost equal for both PrFeAsO and for Pr_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (Fig. 1(a)-1(c)). In analogy to 1111, one can expect that "optimal" h_{P} and proper doping should lead to high T_{c} in 42214 compounds. L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Sm and Gd) doped with fluorine, as one of the options, was assumed to be the ideal candidate for increasing T_{c} at 42214 because h_{P} of LFeAsO (L = Sm, Gd) corresponds to the maximal T_{c}. To prove this suggestion, a detailed structural study of undoped L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Pr, Sm, Gd) was performed, and the influence of fluorine substitution for oxygen on T_{c} in L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Sm, Gd) was studied.

Here, we report on the high-pressure crystal growth, structure, and doping of L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y} (L = Pr, Sm, Gd) single crystals. The critical temperature of Gd42214 single crystals increased after F doping from 25 K up to 45 K.

## II Experimental details

The crystals of Pr_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4}, Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y}, and Gd_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y} were grown at high pressure from precursors (presitened mixture of 0.9PrAs + 0.1PrTe + FeO, 0.9SmAs + 0.1TeO_{2} + 0.5FeO + 0.15FeF_{2} + 0.35Fe + 0.1Sm and Fe + 0.9GdAs + 0.1GdTe + 0.8FeO + 0.1FeF_{2}, respectively) in NaCl/KCl flux. The procedure is described by Katrych _et al._[12]. The same procedure was used for the growth of L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Sm, Gd) crystals from stoichiometric mixture of high-purity (\geqslant99.95%) L, LAs, FeO, and TeO_{2}.

The single crystals were studied on a three-circle x-ray diffractometer equipped with a CCD detector (Bruker AXS Inc.). Data reduction and multiscan absorption correction were performed using the APEx2[20] and SAINT[21] software. The crystal structure was solved by a direct method, and the full  data set was refined on F^{2}, employing the programs shellXS-97 [22] and shellxl-97 [23].

The magnetization as a function of temperature has been measured for individual single crystals of L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{7}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Pr, Gd) and L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-x}F_{y} (L = Sm, Gd) doped with fluorine. These experiments have been done with a magnetic property measurement system (MPMS) with enhanced sensitivity (MPMS-XL).

Because individual Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} single crystals were too small, the magnetic susceptibility \chi_{\rho} measurement was performed on a powdered sample using an MPMS (Quantum Design) under zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) conditions.

The electrical resistivity (\rho) of a Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-x}F_{y} single crystal was measured as a function of temperature using a standard four-probe method. Gold wires of 12 \mum diameter were glued with silver paint on a 150-\mum-long sample in a van der Pauw geometry. The contact resistance was less than 200 \Omega. A sensing current of 100 \muA was generated using a Keithley 220 programmable current source, and the resulting signal was measured by a Keithley 2182 nanovoltmeter. The sample was cooled in a liquid helium bath cryostat from room temperature at a rate of 0.5 K/min.

The magnetic anisotropy measurements were carried out with a homemade magnetic torque sensor [24]. A tiny Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-x}F_{y} single crystal (\sim100 \times 100 \times 10 \mum^{3}) was fixed on a platform hanging on piezoresistive legs. When a static magnetic field was applied to this anisotropic superconductor, a torque proportional to the vector product of magnetization and field appears and bends the piezoresistive legs. The resulting change in resistance can be read out electronically, yielding a signal proportional to the torque [24].

  

## III Results and Discussion

### Structure analysis

The crystals of Pr_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} with plate-like shape reveal nice quality with a mosaic spread of \sim1.1^{\circ} (Fig. 2).

Structure of 42214 (Fig. 1(a)) was determined and refined on the base of 670 independent reflections. Since the displacement parameter of Te was larger than that of other atoms, the occupation parameter for it was set as a free variable. Finally, the Te site reveals about 10% of vacancies [12]. The same Te deficiency was found in L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L= Sm, Gd), which was refined using the Pr_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} structural model. Table 1 and Table 2 provide the results of structure determination and refinement.

Despite the entirely different stoichiometric composition or formula type, the determined structure has some resemblance to that of La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}[10], or another representative of its structure type, superconducting La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}[344] [11]. The number of atoms in the unit cells as well as the space group are the same (Pearson symbol: t/26, space-group:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c} Atom & Site & x & y & z & L= Pr/Sm/Gd & U_{iso} & U_{11}=U_{22} & U_{33} \\ \hline L_{1} & 4e & \nu_{2} & \nu_{2} & 0.0684(1)/0.0690(1)/0.0693(1) & 9(1)/7(1)/8(1) & 8(1)/6(1)/6(1) & 11(1)/8(1)/1(1) \\ L_{2} & 4e & 0 & 0 & 0.1480(1)/0 _14/mmm_). Like in 3442, the structure of 42214 consists of stacked fluorite-type L_{2}O_{2} and anti-fluorite-type M_{2}Pn_{2} layers. However, the sequence and numbers of the two types of layers are dissimilar for the two structures; furthermore, the atom in the center of the unit cell has a positive charge L^{k+} for 3442 and negative charge Te^{\delta-} for 42214. The two structures are isoconfigurational and have interchanged corresponding structure motifs: (L_{2}O_{2})_{2}(M_{2}Pn_{2})Te vs (L_{2}O_{2})(M_{2}Pn_{2})_{2}_{2}

  (Fig. 1(a)-1(c)), where L = Pr, Sm, Gd, and M = Fe, and Pn = As for the former and L = La, Ce, Nd, and M = Cu, Ni, and Pn = P for the latter. Regarding the definition from Lima-de-Faria _et al._[25], the 42214 structure could be considered as an _anti_-La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{2}O_{2}-crystal structure.

The 3442 phase is considered as an ordered mixture of L_M_PnO and L_M_2Pn_{2}[11] (Fig. 2(c)-2(d)). The 42214 could be described as stacking of the 1111 structure with L_{2}O_{2}Te [26] (Fig. 1(a)-1(c)).

Across the lanthanide series, with increasing atomic number in the periodic table and decreasing covalent radius lattice constants, the thickness of the Pr_{2}O_{2} layer, S_{1}, decreases while the thickness of the Fe_{2}As_{2} layer, S_{2} (2 \timesh_{P}), increases (Fig. 3). The corresponding S_{2} and S_{3} layers are very close for both 1111 and 42214 structures [19] (Table I; Fig. 1(a)-1(c)), while the L_{2}O_{2} (S_{1}) layer is thicker in 1111 by 0.1 A. The h_{P} parameter increases monotonically from 1.332 to 1.366 A and is getting, as was expected, close to the "optimal" value for Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O and Gd_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O (1.352(3) and 1.366(3) A, respectively.

The fluorine-doped crystals of Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y} and Gd_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y} were also studied by single-crystal x-ray diffraction. The results are shown in Tables 3 and 4. In both cases, the lattice parameter c is smaller than for samples without fluorine. For Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y}, c is much smaller, which could be caused by a high concentration of tellurium deficiency (about 28 at%). The lattice constants a and b for Gd_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y} remain almost the same as for the sample without fluorine. For Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y}, a and b are slightly smaller in comparison to Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4}. It is rather difficult to find any correlation or exact influence of fluorine doping with the lattice geometry because of different concentrations of vacancies in the Te site for each sample, as well as because of difficulties with estimation of the real fluorine content.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c} Atom & Site & x & y & zL = Sm/Gd & U_{iso} & U_{11} = U_{22} & U_{33} \\ \hline L_{1} & 4e & \% & \% & 0.0683(1)/0.0692(1) & 10(1)/8(1) & 8(1)/6(1) & 13(1)/11(1) \\ L_{2} & 4e & 0 & 0 & 0.1479(1)/0.1476(1) & 10(1)  for two small individual single crystals of L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Pr, Gd) is shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. The m/H(T) measurements for single crystals have been performed in various magnetic fields parallel to the c axis, for the ZFC and FC states. The observed signal reveals bulk superconductivity [12]. Magnetic measurements performed on the Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} powdered sample at an applied field of 0.5 mT showed the onset of superconducting transition at \sim25 K, with a relatively small superconducting shielding fraction (9.4%; see the ZFC curve in Fig. 4, where the density of the compound was calculated to be 7.48 g/cm^{3}). The powdered sample was not single phase.

The onset of the superconducting transition for the Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} sample as well as for both single crystals of L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Pr, Gd) is estimated to be nearly the same, T_{c}\sim 25 K (Figs. 4-5). The omnipresent Te deficiency could be assumed as a doping causing superconductivity. The application of small magnetic fields above 1 mT already leads to a drastic broadening of the transition width, indicative of a very small lower critical field, H_{c1}.

#### iii.3.2 Samples with Te deficiency and doped with fluorine

In Figure 6, the result of fluorine doping can be seen. Figure 6(a) shows m(T) for the ZFC and FC states of a single crystal of Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{0.72(1)}O_{4-x}F_{y}. After substituting nominally 30% of oxygen by fluorine, T_{c} increased from 25 K to 40 K. Figure 6(b) shows m(T) for a Gd_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{0.92(1)}O_{4-y}F_{y} single crystal. Here, substitution of nominally 20% of oxygen by fluorine increased T_{c} up to 45 K. It is not clear if maximum T_{c} has been obtained. Doping dependence on T_{c} should be investigated in a broader range of compositions.

### Transport measurement

The onset superconducting critical temperature is 36 K for Sm_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4-y}F_{y} (Fig. 7). The \rho-T curve suggests that the sample is not optimally doped and that some inhomogeneity is present in the structure. This might explain the small upturn in \rho just above the superconducting transition.

### Magnetic torque studies

Figure 8 shows the torque as a function of the angle \theta between the applied magnetic field H and the crystallographic c axis. When the field direction is swept clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW), a hysteresis between the CW and CCW torque curves appears. This is due to the pinning of the vortices on crystal defects [27]. The data shown here are the average of the CW and CCW curves.

The angular torque data are analyzed with the Kogan model [28], which allows the anisotropy \gamma of the material to be extracted. The anisotropy parameter \gamma is defined as \lambda_{c}/\lambda_{ab}, where \lambda_{i} is the magnetic field penetration depth for a field along the crystallographic i axis. The fit is done assuming a Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg [29] dependence of the upper critical field, with a slope at T_{c} given in Ref. [12].

The fit results in a rather high anisotropy of 31, measured at 25 K. This anisotropy is one of the highest among the iron-based superconductor family, consistent with the large distance between the superconducting Fe_{2}As_{2} layers in this material.

## IV Conclusion

Single crystals of layered superconductors L_{4}Fe_{2}As_{2}Te_{1-x}O_{4} (L = Pr, Sm, Gd; x\sim 0.1) were grown using the high-pressure cubic anvil technique. The structure reveals the stacking of anti-fluorite-type M_{2}Pn_{2} and fluorite-type L_{2}O_{2} layers, alternating with the chain of tellurium atoms, and it could be considered as an anti-La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}-crystal structure. The critical temperature T_{c} is about 25 K and does not show any dependence on the kind of lanthanide atom.

The solid line denotes a fit according to the Kogan model from which the anisotropy parameter \gamma = 31 was extracted.

Doping with fluorine increases T_{c} of \mathrm{Sm}_{4}\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{1-x}\mathrm{O}_{4-y} \mathrm{F}_{y} up to 40 K and that of \mathrm{Gd}_{4}\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{1-x}\mathrm{O}_{4-y} \mathrm{F}_{y} up to 45 K. For determination of maximum T_{c} of 42214, more detailed studies of T_{c} dependence on doping are necessary.
