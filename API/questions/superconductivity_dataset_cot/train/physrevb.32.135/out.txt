###### Abstract

The magnetic and superconducting properties of the Heusler alloy Pd2YbSn have been investigated with heat-capacity, resistivity, and magnetic-susceptibility measurements. The material undergoes a superconducting transition at 2.46 K and a magnetic transition at 0.23 K. The absence of reentrant behavior shows that the magnetically ordered state is coexistent with the superconductivity. A combined analysis of all the data gives the cubic crystalline electric-field parameters W\!=\!-12 K and x\!=\!-0.65, implying that the ground state of the Yb^{3+} ion in Pd2YbSn is a \Gamma_{7} magnetic doublet.

## I Introduction

Heusler alloys of the general formula A_{2}BZ crystallizing in the cubic L\!\!\!2_{1} structure can be formed with d transition elements.[1] Recently, rare earth-containing Heusler alloys of the general form Pd2_{2}RSn (R\!=\!heavy rare earth) have been reported in the literature.[2] Some of these have been found to exhibit superconductivity or magnetic ordering.[2, 3] In particular, the compounds investigated by ourselves[3] with R\!=\!Tb and Dy show antiferromagnetic ordering with T_{N} of 9 and 15 K, respectively, and no superconductivity down to 1.4 K, the compounds with R\!=\!Ho and Er show neither superconductivity nor magnetic ordering in the same temperature range, and the compounds with R\!=\!Tm and Yb are found to be superconducting with superconducting transition temperatures T_{e}\!=\!2.82 and 2.42 K, respectively. Although previous work[2] had indicated a magnetic transition in Pd2YbSn at low temperatures, the data were not obtained at sufficiently low temperatures to verify the result. Until now, the nature of the transition was not known, and therefore the question of the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in Pd2YbSn has needed more detailed investigation. Analysis of magnetic susceptibility for the Tm compound has revealed[3] the presence of crystalline electric field (CEF) interactions which result in the Tm ion having a nonmagnetic doublet ground state. As a result, the depression of the superconducting transition temperature by magnetic pair-breaking is suppressed, and the sample has a relatively high T_{e}. In the case of the Yb compound also, the susceptibility data indicate the presence of CEF interactions,[3] but those data alone were not able to fully specify the ground state.

We present here the results of low-temperature heat capacity and resistivity measurements which serve to clarify many of the above questions. A magnetic transition is verified with T_{M}\!=\!0.23 K, coexistent with the superconducting state. This is the first Heusler alloy containing rare earth that shows coexistence behavior. This phenomena had been observed earlier only in some ternary borides and Chevrel phase compounds.[4] In conjunction with the susceptibility data, a detailed analysis has been carried out which fully specifies the CEF ground state.

## II Experimental

The sample was prepared from pure elements by arc melting in Ar gas followed by annealing _in vacuo_ for eight days at 900^{\circ} C. The superconducting transition temperature was determined from ac susceptibility (X_{\rm ac}), resistivity, and heat-capacity measurements. X_{\rm ac} was measured using an ac mutual inductance bridge operating at a frequency of 900 Hz. Resistivities were measured on a thin section cut from the arc-melted pellet used for heat-capacity measurements. Current and potential leads were attached with silver paste. Resistances were measured with a Linear Research LR-400 4-wire ac resistance bridge using a current of 300 \mu a. Susceptibility (dc) measurements were carried out in the temperature range 5-300 K using a superconducting quantum-interference device (SQUID) magnetometer.

Heat capacities were measured in an isothermal calorimeter connected to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator by a mechanical heat switch. Temperatures were measured with calibrated germanium-resistance thermometers obtained from Lake Shore Cryotronics, Inc., using the above-mentioned 4-wire bridge. Heater currents were obtained from a Cryocal CS1000B constant-current source. Voltages were measured on a Keithley model-191 digital voltmeter. Temperature increments were about 10% of the absolute temperature, except near the magnetic and superconducting transition temperatures, where smaller increments were used to enhance the resolution. Curvature corrections were applied, but in most cases they were less than 1%.

## III Results and Discussions

Resistivity, ac susceptibility, and heat-capacity data obtained in the temperature range from 1.5 to 3.0 K are shown in Fig. 1. The susceptibility and heat capacity show a broad superconducting transition centered at T_{e}\!=\!2.36 K. The resistivity drops rapidly at somewhat higher temperatures, indicating that some regions of the sample become superconducting at 2.7 K, while the susceptibility shows that some of the material is still normal down to 2.0 K. Reentrant behavior, which would be marked by a return to normal state resistivity, is not seen down to the lowest temperatures measured (0.16 K), showing that no ferromagnetic transitions occur in this region.

Heat-capacity data have been obtained in the temperature range of 0.10 to 20.9 K. Results for temperatures up to 0.4 K are shown in Fig. 2. A clear anomaly corresponding to a magnetic transition is seen with a peak at 0.23 K. In view of the persistence of the superconducting state below 0.23 K as observed from the resistivity data, we conclude that this transition is not to a long-range ferromagnetic state.

For the cubic point symmetry of the Yb ions in the Heusler structure, the CEF interactions are commonly described by the parametrization of Lea, Leask, and Wolf:[5]

\[H_{\rm CEF} = B_{4}(O_{4}^{0} + 5O_{4}^{4}) + B_{6}(O_{6}^{0} - 21O_{6}^{4})\] (1) \[= \frac{W_{X}}{F_{4}}(O_{4}^{0} + 5O_{4}^{4}) + \frac{W(1 - |\,x\,|\,)}{F_{6}}(O_{6}^{0} - 21O_{6}^{4})\;,\]

where the O_{n}^{m} are Stevens operators, B_{4} and B_{6} are empirical CEF parameters, and F_{4} and F_{6} have the values 60 and 1260, respectively, for Yb^{3+}. In this case, the CEF ground state can be either a quartet (\Gamma_{8}) or one of two doublets (\Gamma_{6} or \Gamma_{7}).

The upper solid line in Fig. 2 shows the result of a mean-field calculation of the magnetic heat capacity assuming values of the parameters (W = - 6.38 K, x = - 0.5) appropriate for a \Gamma_{8} (quartet) ground state. Similarly, the lower solid line shows the results of the same calculation for a doublet ground state (in this case W = - 10.27 K, x = - 0.7, giving a \Gamma_{7} level). The above crystal-field parameters were chosen based on the susceptibility fit[3] from 5 K to 300 K. It is clear that the data are best described by a doublet ground state, although there is an apparent smearing of the magnetic transition which causes the peak height of the heat capacity to be less than that calculated. Integration of the heat capacity up to 2 K gives a magnetic entropy of S/R = 0.632, very close to the value expected for a doublet ground state of S/R = \ln 2 = 0.693, again indicating a broadened magnetic transition in a doublet ground state. This is consistent with the previous analysis of paramagnetic susceptibility for this material[3] which showed that the ground state was a doublet, but could not distinguish between \Gamma_{6} or \Gamma_{7}.

In order to further specify the nature of the CEF splittings, we have carried out a combined analysis of the heat capacity and the magnetic susceptibility above the magnetic transition. Figure 3 shows the heat capacity in the temperature range of approximately 3 to 20 K. This has been analyzed according to

Figure 3: Heat capacity of Pd_{2}YbSn in the region above the superconducting transition temperature. The solid curve is a fit to the data including contributions from the electronic heat capacity, the lattice heat capacity, and the electronic Schottky effect from crystalline electric field levels.

Figure 2: Heat capacity of Pd_{2}YbSn showing the magnetic transition at 0.23 K. The upper solid curve shows the mean-field heat capacity for a quartet crystal-field ground state, and the lower solid curve for a doublet ground state.

  \[C = \gamma T + \alpha T^{3} + C_{\rm Schottky}\ ,\] (2)

where the three terms correspond to the electronic heat capacity, the lattice heat capacity, and the electronic Schottky effect due to CEF splittings. A least-squares-fit procedure has been used which varied \alpha, \gamma, and the W and x of Eq. (1), with the latter two parameters falling in the range specified by previous analysis of the susceptibilities.3 The solid line in Fig. 3 shows the best fit to the data, corresponding to the values

\[\alpha = 1.80 \pm 0.03\ \rm mJ\cdot mole^{-1}\,K^{-4}\ ,\] \[\gamma = 0.1\ \rm mJ\cdot mole^{-1}\,K^{-2}\ ,\] \[W = - 12 \pm 2\ \rm K,\ \rm and\  been obtained. It is shown that this material undergoes a superconducting transition with T_{c} = 2.36 K. At T_{M} = 0.23 K, a transition occurs to an ordered magnetic state, which is coexistent with the superconducting state. Detailed analysis of all the data provides crystalline electric field parameters W = - 12 K and x = - 0.65, implying that the ground state of Yb^{3+} ion in Pd_{2}YbSn is the magnetic doublet, \Gamma_{\gamma}.
