###### Abstract

We report on a comprehensive study of the transport, specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and optical spectroscopy on single crystal of Fe1.05Te, which undergoes a first-order phase transition near 65 K. We show that its physical properties are considerably different from other parent compounds of FeAs-based systems, presumably attributed to the presence of excess Fe ions. The charge transport is rather incoherent above the transition, and no clear signature of the gap is observed below the transition temperature. Strong impurity scattering effect exists also in Se-doped superconducting sample Fe1.03Se0.30Te0.70, leading to a relatively low \(T_{c}\) but a rather high upper critical field.

The recent discovery of superconductivity in Fe- and Ni-based transition metal oxypnictides has triggered tremendous interest in searching for new Fe-based superconductors with similar PbO-type tetrahedral layers.[1] FeSe(Te) belongs to this tetragonal family with the simplest crystal structure. It comprises only a continuous stacking of tetrahedral FeSe(Te) layers along the \(c\) axis. Superconductivity with transition temperature \(T_{c}\) up to 15 K was obtained on Fe1.04(Se,Te) system at ambient pressure.[2, 3, 4] The \(T_{c}\) can go up to 27 K at a pressure of 1.48 GPa.[5] First-principles calculations[6] on stoichiometric FeSe indicate that the electron-phonon coupling cannot explain the superconductivity at such a high transition temperature, and FeSe is in the category of unconventional superconductivity. The calculated Fermi surface (FS) structures of FeS, FeSe, and FeTe are very similar to that of FeAs-based superconductors, with cylindrical hole sections at the zone center and electron sections at the zone corner. Those Fermi surfaces are separated by a two-dimensional nesting wave vector at \((\pi,\pi)\). Spin-density-wave (SDW) ground state is obtained due to the substantial FS nesting effect. In particular, in going from FeSe to FeTe, the strength of the SDW instability is strongly enhanced.

Experimentally, it is difficult to synthesize the stoichiometric FeSe(Te), and excess Fe is always present in synthesized compounds.[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56 a physical property measurement system (PPMS) of Quantum Design Co. The optical reflectance measurements were performed on Bruker IFS 66 v/s spectrometer on newly cleaved surfaces (_ab_ plane) of those crystals up to 25 000 cm\({}^{-1}\). An _in situ_ gold and aluminum overcoating technique was used to get the reflectivity \(R(\omega)\).[12] The real part of conductivity \(\sigma_{1}(\omega)\) is obtained by the Kramers-Kronig transformation of \(R(\omega)\).

Figure 1(a) shows the temperature dependence of in-plane resistivity \(\rho_{ab}\) of Fe\({}_{1.05}\)Te in zero field and 14 T (magnetic field along the \(c\) axis). At high temperature, the resistivity shows a semiconductorlike behavior; i.e., \(\rho_{ab}\) increases slowly with decreasing temperature, whereas \(\rho_{ab}\) drops steeply below 65 K and then behaves quite metallic. This discontinuous change in the resistivity at 65 K is due to a structural phase transition, accompanied by magnetic transition.[8, 9] A thermal hysteresis of 2 K is clearly seen in the inset of Fig. 1(a). The resistivity data were measured at a slow heating and cooling rate of 3 K/min. This is consistent with the recent neutron-diffraction measurements on Fe\({}_{1.05}\)Te polycrystalline samples, which indicated that the \(P4/nmm\) tetragonal structure distorts to a \(Pmmn\) orthorhombic[9] or a \(P2_{1}/m\) monoclinic structure[9] and Fe\({}_{1.05}\)Te orders into an incommensurate magnetic state when the temperature is lowered below \(\sim\)65 K. We have also attempted to probe the influence of magnetic fields on the \(\rho(T)\) behavior. We find that the magnetic transition temperature is insensitive to the applied field and the magnetoresistance is negligibly small in the AF state (less than 0.5% near 2 K at the maximum applied field of 14 T). This behavior is different from that observed in SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), \([\rho_{ab}(\overline{N})\cdot\rho_{ab}(\overline{O}T)]/\rho_{ab}(\overline{O}T)\) reaching as high as 20% at 10 K.[13] This indicates that the magnetic coupling is much stronger in FeTe compared to other FeAs-based systems.

In Fig. 1(b), we present the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility \(\chi\) in a field of 1 T with \(H\)\(\parallel\)_ab_ and \(H\)\(\parallel\)_c_ axis, respectively. Near 65 K, \(\chi\) decreases abruptly by a factor of 2, indicative of the presence of the first-order phase transition. Above this temperature, \(\chi\) shows a Curie-Weiss-type behavior: \(\chi\) decreases with increasing \(T\). This is in contrast to those observed in \(R\)FeAsO (\(R\)=La and rare-earth elements) and \(A\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (\(A\)=Sr,Ba) parent compounds above \(T_{\rm SDW}\).[13, 14] The behavior could thus be attributed to the excess Fe with local moment formation. Nevertheless, a simple Curie-Weiss law could not reproduce the experimental data well, which could be ascribed to the short-range antiferromagnetic correlation or spin fluctuation of FeTe layers.

To get more information about the magnetic and structural phase transition, we performed specific-heat measurement for Fe\({}_{1.05}\)Te. Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of specific heat \(C_{p}\) from 2 to 90 K. We can see clearly a sharp \(\delta\)-function shape peak at about 65 K with \(\Delta C\)\(\sim\) 0.8 J/mol K. This is a characteristic feature of a first-order phase transition; even though the relaxation method employed in PPMS to measure heat capacity suppresses sharp features due to first-order transitions. The transition temperature agrees well with that observed in resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements. It is worth noting that only one peak at around 65 K is observed in Fe\({}_{1.05}\)Te. This suggests that the structural transition and magnetic order occur at the same temperature. A number of studies suggested that the structural phase transition is driven by the magnetic transition. Depending on the strength of coupling along the \(c\) axis, the structural and magnetic transitions could occur simultaneously or separately.[15] On this basis, the FeTe compound may have a strong interlayer coupling. At low temperatures, a good linear \(T^{2}\) dependence of \(C_{p}/T\) is observed, indicating that the specific heat \(C_{p}\) is mainly contributed by electrons and phonons [see inset of Fig. 2(a)]. The fit yields the electronic coefficient \(\gamma\)=34 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) and the Debye temperature \(\theta_{\rm\it 0}\)=141 K. The electronic coefficient is significantly larger than the values obtained from the band structure calculations.[16] Note that, for the parent compound of LaFeAsO and SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), the electronic coefficients are significantly smaller than the values obtained from the band structure calculations for nonmagnetic state. It was explained as due to a partial energy gap opening below SDW transition which removes parts of the density of states.[13, 17] Thus, the higher value here suggests an absence of gap opening below the transition.

Figure 2(b) shows the Hall coefficient data between 10 and 300 K for Fe\({}_{1.05}\)Te. The inset shows the verification of the Hall voltage driven by magnetic field where a linear dependence of the transverse voltage on the applied magnetic field is observed up to 3 T at 100 K. Two sets of data were presented in the main panel. The empty squares are Hall coefficient data measured by scanning magnetic field at fixed temperature, while the solid black curve is \(R_{H}\) determined from two separate temperature scans under fixed applied

  magnetic field at 3 T, respectively. They show a rather good match. In Fig. 2(b), we find that there is an abrupt sign change in \(R_{H}\) at 65 K, but the absolute values are almost unchanged. Furthermore, \(R_{H}\) in Fe\({}_{1.05}\)Te is nearly temperature independent even below 65 K. Those behaviors are considerably different from the FeAs-based parent compounds. For example, in the case of SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), \(R_{H}\) drops quickly below _T_SDW and continuously decreases to a very large negative value with decreasing temperature. The absolute value of \(R_{H}\) at 2 K is about 35 times larger than that above _T_SDW.1 The huge increase in the \(R_{H}\) value is naturally explained by the gaping/reconstruction of the FS in the magnetic ordered phase. This was indeed confirmed by the optical spectroscopy measurement.[18] Here, \(R_{H}\) only shows an abrupt sign change but keeps almost the same absolute value. This may again indicate that the FS is not gapped. The change might be caused only by a sudden reconstruction of band structure. Further effort on this issue is still needed.

To further probe the carrier dynamics, we measured the optical response of the Fe\({}_{1.05}\)Te crystal. Figure 3 shows the reflectance _R_(_o_) and conductivity \(s\)1(_o_) spectra at different temperatures. In accord with the nonmetallic dc resistivity above _T_SDW, we find that the low-frequency reflectance decreases slightly with decreasing temperature from 300 to 70 K, leading to a reduction in low-_o_ conductivity. It is important to note that the conductivity spectra above _T_SDW are rather flat. Clearly, it is not a semiconductor as \(s\)1(_o_) does not indicate the presence of a semiconductrolife gap, but it is not a usual metal as well because of the absence of a Drude-type peak. As is well known, the width of Drude peak is linked with the scattering rate (or inverse of the transport lifetime) of the quasiparticle; the measurement result indicates that there is no well-defined quasiparticle with sufficiently long transport lifetime above _T_SDW. This means that the charge transport is rather incoherent. Below _T_SDW, the low-_o_ _R_(_o_) increases fast. Correspondingly, a Drude component in \(s\)1(_o_) develops at low frequency, reflecting a dramatic reduction of the carrier scattering rate in the magnetic ordered state. However, unlike the parent compounds of LaFeAsO and AF\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (_A_ = Ba, Sr), there is no partial gap formation in optical spectra below _T_SDW, which is consistent with the specific-heat and Hall coefficient data mentioned above.

All above experiment results indicate that the Fe\({}_{1.05}\)Te compound is very different from the LaFeAsO and AF\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (_A_ = Ba, Sr) parent compounds. In LaFeAsO and AF\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (_A_ = Ba, Sr), the charge carriers are itinerant and the SDW order is driven by the nesting of FS, which also leads to a partial energy gap formation and a removal of a large part of conducting carriers. However, in Fe\({}_{1.05}\)Te, no well-defined quasiparticles with sufficiently long lifetime exist above _T_SDW, very likely due to strong magnetic scattering from the excess Fe ions, and furthermore, no clear gap formation is seen below _T_SDW. Those behaviors might be understood from a local moment picture with complex frustrations.[16, 19] but recent density-functional calculations based on itinerant framework indicate that the doping effect and the large magnetic moment induced by excess Fe could cause a size mismatch between the electron and hole Fermi surfaces and a disappearance of commensurate SDW order.[11] The cooperative effect of excess Fe and the electrons in the FeTe layers may give such complicated behavior.

Finally we present the physical properties of a superconducting single crystal Fe\({}_{1.03}\)Se\({}_{0.30}\)Te\({}_{0.70}\). In such Se-doped sample, the magnetism/structure instability is suppressed and superconductivity appears instead. Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependence of resistivity _ph__ab_ on the single crystal Fe\({}_{1.03}\)Se\({}_{0.30}\)Te\({}_{0.70}\) with _I_\(\mid\)_ab_ at zero field. _ph__ab_ increases with decreasing \(T\) and shows a sharp drop to zero at about 11 K, indicating a superconducting transition. The Hall coefficient \(R_{H}\), as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(a), is positive, suggesting dominantly hole-type conducting carriers. Figures 4(b) and 4(c) show _ph__ab_(_T_) for Fe\({}_{1.03}\)Se\({}_{0.30}\)Te\({}_{0.70}\) in external magnetic fields up to 14 T within _ab_ plane and along \(c\) axis, respectively. We can see that the superconducting transition is broadened slightly in magnetic fields up to 14 T. The behavior is rather different from polycrystalline LaOFeAs where the superconducting transition is broadened strongly in magnetic fields.[20] Fig. 4(d) shows _H_\({}_{c2}\)-_T_c curves for both _H_\(\mid\)_ab_ and _H_\(\mid\)_c_, respectively, where \(T_{c}\) is defined by a criterion of 50% of normal state resistivity. The curves _H_\({}_{c2}\)(_T_) are very steep with slopes \(dH_{c2}^{\text{ob}}/dT\big{|}_{T}\) = 5.96 T/ K for _H_\(\mid\)_ab_ and \(dH_{c2}^{\text{c}}/dT\big{|}_{T}\) = 3.69 T/ K for _H_\(\mid\)_c_. Using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg formula[21]\(H_{c2}(0)\) = -0.69(\(dH_{c2}/dt)T_{c}\) and taking \(T_{c}\) = 12.4 K, the upper critical fields are estimated as \(H_{c2}^{\text{ob}}\)= 51 T and \(H_{c2}^{\text{c}}\)= 31 T, respectively. It is important to note that those values are very large, comparable to the values found for _F_-doped LaFeAsO with \(T_{c}\) higher than 20 K.[20]

It has been well known that, for the two-gap superconductivity in the dirty limit, the impurity scattering could strongly enhance the upper critical field _H__c2.[22]_ Such a trend is clearly observed for MgB\({}_{2}\), a dirty two-gap superconductor, where the \(H_{c}\) increases remarkably with the increase in resistivity by alloying MgB\({}_{2}\) with nonmagnetic impurities.[22] Then, the very high \(H_{c}\),2 observed in Fe\({}_{1.03}\)Se\({}_{0.30}\)Te\({}_{0.70}\) could be reasonably attributed to the strong impurity scattering effect from the randomly distributed excess Fe in such a new multiple band superconductor. The impurity scattering, particularly in the case of Fe\({}^{+}\) with a magnetic moment, would also suppress \(T_{c}\). This could be the reason why \(T_{c}\) is not so high, although density-functional calculations indicated a higher strength of SDW order in stoichiometric FeTe, and therefore expected a higher \(T_{c}\) after the suppression of SDW order.[6, 11]

To conclude, the electronic properties of single-crystalline Fe\({}_{1.05}\)Te and Fe\({}_{1.03}\)Se\({}_{0.30}\)Te\({}_{0.70}\) were studied. The excess Fe

  ions in those compounds dramatically modify their properties. For Fe\({}_{1.03}\)Te above \(T_{\rm SDW}\), we could not identify well-defined quasiparticles with sufficiently long lifetime. Below \(T_{\rm SDW}\), a small Drude component develops at low frequency due to the dramatic reduction in carrier scattering rate. But unlike LaFeAsO and SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), there is no clear sign of gap opening from optical, Hall coefficient and low-\(T\) specific-heat measurement results. Strong impurity scattering effect seems to exist also in Se-doped superconducting sample, which leads to a relatively low \(T_{c}\) but a rather high upper critical field in such a new multiple band superconductor.
