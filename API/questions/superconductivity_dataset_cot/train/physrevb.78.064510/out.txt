###### Abstract

We report ^{123}Sb nuclear-quadrupole-resonance (NQR) measurements of the filled skutterudite heavy-fermion superconductor PrOs4Sb12 under high pressure. The temperature dependence of NQR frequency and the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T_{1} indicate that the crystal-electric-field splitting \Delta_{\rm CEF} between the ground-state \Gamma_{1} singlet and the first-excited-state \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} triplet decreases with increasing pressure. ac-susceptibility measurements indicate that the superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) also decreases with increasing pressure. However, above P\sim 2 GPa, both \Delta_{\rm CEF} and T_{c} do not depend on external pressure up to P = 3.82 GPa. These pressure dependences of \Delta_{\rm CEF} and T_{c} suggest an intimate relationship between quadrupole excitations associated with the \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} level and unconventional superconductivity in PrOs4Sb12. In the superconducting state, 1/T_{1} below T_{c}=1.55 and 1.57 K at P=1.91 and 2.63 GPa shows a power-law temperature variations and is proportional to T^{5} at temperatures considerably below T_{c}. These data can be well fitted by the gap model \Delta(\theta)=\Delta_{0} sin \theta, with \Delta_{0}=3.08k_{B}T_{c} and 3.04k_{B}T_{c} for P=1.91 and 2.63 GPa, respectively. The results indicate that there exist point nodes in the gap function.

  medium, respectively.[39, 40] The pressure at low temperatures was determined from the pressure dependence of the T_{c} values of Sn and/or Pb metals measured by a conventional four-terminal method. Temperature dependence of ac susceptibility is measured by a four-terminal method using NQR coil. Data below 1.4 K were collected using a ^{3}He/^{4}He dilution refrigerator at P=0 and a ^{3}He refrigerator under P=1.91 and 2.63 GPa, respectively.

The Sb nuclei have two isotopes of ^{121}Sb and ^{123}Sb with natural abundances of 57.3% and 42.7%, respectively. Since ^{121}Sb and ^{122}Sb have the nuclear spin I= 5/2 and 7/2, respectively, five Sb-NQR transitions are observed.[14] It has been confirmed that relaxation process at the Sb site is magnetic in origin.[14] In the present experiment, all measurements were done at the \pm3/2 \leftrightarrow +-5/2 transition (hereafter, 2\nu_{Q} transition for short) of the ^{123}Sb nucleus.

Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show a typical data set of ^{123}Sb-NQR recovery curves of 2\nu_{Q} transition to obtain relaxation time T_{1} which are measured at T=1.54 K just below T_{c}(P)= 1.57 K [Fig. 1(a)] and T=0.59 K well below T_{c}(P) [Fig. 1(b)] at P=2.63 GPa, respectively. Since there is an asymmetry parameter \eta at the position of Sb nucleus, T_{1} is determined by the theoretical curve of nuclear magnetization where the value of \eta is incorporated.[41] As seen in Fig. 1(b), to avoid possible heating due to the rf pulses, we used small amplitude rf pulses in the T_{1} measurements at very low temperatures. We confirmed the lack of a heating effect to T_{1} process by ensuring that the spin-echo intensity is not affected by an rf pulse with a slightly off-resonance frequency, which was applied before the \pi/2-\pi pulse sequence.

## III III. Uncommon superconductivity in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} at ambient pressure

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependences of 1/T_{1} at ambient pressure (solid circles). The ambient-pressure data are in excellent agreement with those reported previously (open circles).[14] At high temperatures, 100 K >T>T_{0}\sim 10 K, 1/T_{1} increase slightly and become temperature independent with decreasing temperature. In this case, the relaxation rate is dominated by the Pr 4/^{2}-derived localized magnetic moments on the \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} triplet state. With decreasing temperature below T_{0}\sim 10 K, 1/T_{1} starts to decrease because a depopulation of 4f electron at \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} triplet state occurs below T\leq\Delta_{\rm{CEF}}/k_{B}. Such a phenomenon is also confirmed in temperature dependence of 2\nu_{Q} resonance frequency as will be discussed later. Remarkably, just below T_{c}, the Hebel

Dotted lines indicate a relation of 1/T_{1}=const. Solid and dotted arrows indicate T_{c} and T_{0}, respectively. The inset shows temperature dependence of NQR frequency for 2\nu_{Q} transition at ambient pressure (solid circle) along with previous report (open circle) cited from literature (Ref. [14]).

The solid curves are theoretical fitting curve (see text).

  Slichter (coherence) peak is absent, indicating a non-s-wave superconductivity. At further low temperatures 1/T_{1} decreases exponentially.[14] Below T=0.4 K, 1/T_{1} become a constant, which is likely due to impurities. The present sample reproduces the previous results but shows smaller contribution of 1/T_{1}=const behavior at the lowest-temperature region than previous report,[14] which suggests that now samples have better quality.[24] The most likely cause for such T-independent 1/T_{1} is the presence of a small amount of magnetic impurity, which is pressure independent.

The inset of Fig. 2 shows the temperature dependence of the 2\nu_{Q} transition at P=0. T_{0} is the temperature at which the 2\nu_{Q} resonance frequency increases abruptly. Since the electrical field gradient (EFG) is predominantly determined by the on-site charge distribution, the NQR frequency is a powerful probe of the population of the ground/excited state. Indeed, in both PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} (Ref. [14]) and PrRu_{4}Sb_{12},[42]T_{0} is in good agreement with \Delta_{\rm CEF}/k_{B}. More recently, it has been suggested that the temperature dependence of NQR frequency can be accounted for by the EFG associated with the hexadecapole moment of the \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} state.[43] Therefore, it is concluded that the increase in the NQR frequency below T_{0} is due to the depopulation of f electron in the \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} state below this temperature. Here, we determined T_{0}=12 K at ambient pressure, below which 1/T_{1} and d\nu_{Q}/dT starts to decrease.

## IV Pressure dependence of \Delta_{\rm CEF} in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}

As discussed in Sec. III, we can estimate a value of \Delta_{\rm CEF} from the temperature dependence of NQR frequency. Figure 3 shows typical data set of temperature dependence of ^{123}Sb-NQR spectra measured at 2\nu_{Q} transition at P =2.63 GPa. As seen in Fig. 3, at P=2.63 GPa, ^{123}Sb-NQR spectrum has a symmetrical shape and the center of spectrum clearly shifts to higher frequency due to the depopulation of f electron in the \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} state below T_{0} (\propto\Delta_{\rm CEF}/k_{B}). Thus, we can determine the peak position of NQR spectra precisely even under high pressure. Figure 4 summarizes the temperature dependence of 2\nu_{Q} resonance frequency under various pressures. The temperature dependence of 2\nu_{Q} resonance frequency shifts to lower temperature under pressure indicating the decrease in \Delta_{\rm CEF} with increasing pressure but it does not change between P=2.63 and 3.82 GPa. As seen in the inset of Fig. 4, we define T_{0} at which df/dT starts to decrease steeply. Here, f denotes 2\nu_{Q} resonance frequency. We determined T_{0}(P)\sim 10, 7, and 7 K at P=0.84, 2.63, and 3.82 GPa, respectively. The pressure dependence of T_{0} is summarized in Fig. 6(a). Notably, it is found that T_{0} decreases with increasing pressure up to P\sim 2 GPa (Ref. [36]) but becomes pressure independent above P\sim 2 GPa.

## V Pressure dependence of T_{c} in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}

Next  the superconductivity in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}. To clarify their relationship more quantitatively, further experimental studies under high pressure are highly deserved.

On the theoretical side, it has been proposed that the superconductivity is mediated by the excitons due to the \Gamma_{4}^{(2)}-\Gamma_{1} quasiquartet [12]. In such case, T_{c}(P) would increase due to the enhancement of such interaction when \Delta_{\rm CEF} is reduced. However, clearly, our results indicate T_{c} decreases with increasing pressure and do not lend a straightforward support to the theory. Notably, recent Eliashberg theory revealed the \Delta_{\rm CEF} dependence of T_{c} in La_{1-x}Pr_{x}Os_{4}Sb_{12} system [34]. They indicate, in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, the reduction in \Delta_{\rm CEF} results a suppression of T_{c} due to the magnetic scattering. It is good agreement with present results. However, they also suggest that PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} is s-wave singlet superconductor [34] and is not compatible with present results. Further theories are called for.

## VI VI. Evolution of normal state electric properties in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} under pressure

Next, we discuss the pressure and temperature dependences of ^{123}Sb-NQR relaxation rate 1/T_{1}, which gives information on the dynamical electric and on superconducting properties. Figure 7 shows the temperature dependence of 1/T_{1}T at P=0, 1.91, 2.34, and 2.63 GPa. In Sec. IV, we concluded that \Delta_{\rm CEF} decreases with increasing pressure and it saturates above 2 GPa. Such a conclusion is also supported by the temperature dependence of 1/T_{1}T under pressure. The pressure effect appears below 4 K. At P=0, the reduction in 1/T_{1}T results in a peak structure in the plot of 1/T_{1}T versus T, which is due to the depopulation of the \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} state below T_{0}[14]. At high pressures, 1/T_{1}T continues to increase and the decreases in 1/T_{1}T occur at lower temperature, indicating the decrease in \Delta_{\rm CEF}. Since \Delta_{\rm CEF} decreases with increasing pressure, this may induce the increase in quadrupole fluctuations due to the f electron at the \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} state. These results are consistent with the conclusion inferred from the magnetization measurement [37]. At P=2.34 and 2.63 GPa, 1/T_{1}T in the whole temperature regions has almost the same value. Thus, the peak position and T_{c} found in the temperature dependence of 1/T_{1}T are unchanged above P\sim 2 GPa, and these are consistent with the pressure dependence of T_{0} and T_{c} determined by the temperature dependences of 2\nu_{Q} transition and ac susceptibility as discussed in Secs. I-V.

## VII VII. Superconducting properties under pressure

Next, we discuss the superconducting property in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} under pressure. Figure 8 shows the temperature dependence of 1/T_{1} at P=0, 1.91, and 2.63 GPa. As discussed in Sec. III, the 1/T_{1} is T independent above T_{0}, indicating that the relaxation in the high-temperature region is dominated by the Pr 4/^{2}-derived localized magnetic moments [36]. With decreasing temperature below T_{0}, 1/T_{1}

  starts to decrease. At P = 1.91 and 2.63 GPa, the reduction in 1/_T_1 below T0 to _T__{c} becomes smaller compared to ambient-pressure data since the contribution of the excitation gap \Delta_{\rm CEF} in 1/_T_1 becomes smaller under pressure. Notably, just below _T__{c}(_P_), no coherence peak is observed at high pressures, even though _T__{c} differs in each pressures. This indicates that the lack of coherence peak in PrOs4Sb12 is intrinsic property.

The temperature dependences of 1/_T_1 below _T__{c}(_P_) at high pressures are markedly different from that at ambient pressure. As seen in solid line in Fig. 8, 1/_T_1 at P = 1.91 and 2.63 GPa decreases in a power law like temperature dependence below _T__{c}(_P_). However, at ambient pressure, 1/_T_1 decreases exponentially as indicated by dotted line in Fig. 8. What is the origin of these different temperature dependences of 1/_T_1 below _T__{c} at ambient and under pressures? One possible scenario is provided below. At ambient pressure, the larger excitation gap \Delta_{\rm CEF} contributes to the reduction in 1/_T_1 below _T__{c}, which make the temperature dependence of 1/_T_1 exponential like across _T__{c}. Actually, at P = 1.91, 2.34, and 2.63 GPa, the anomaly at _T__{c}(_P_) in temperature dependence of 1/_T_1 becomes clearer compared to ambient-pressure data since the \Delta_{\rm CEF} decreases under pressure and its contribution to 1/_T_1 under pressure becomes smaller. So, we can determine _T__{c}(_P_) from the temperature dependence of 1/_T_1 as seen in Figs. 8 and 9. Such a scenario is also supported by our previous NQR studies in the substitution systems Pr(Os1-Ru)4Sb12351 was confirmed that \Delta_{\rm CEF} becomes larger when Ru is substituted for Os site.[22, 35] As a result, in Pr(Os1-Ru)4Sb12, it becomes more difficult to determine _T__{c} in the temperature dependence of 1/_T_1 compared to PrOs4Sb12 due to the increase in the contribution of excitation gap \Delta_{\rm CEF} in 1/_T_1 across _T__{c}.[35] Thus, it is suggested that the excitation gap \Delta_{\rm CEF}/k_{B} >= 10 K may make temperature dependence of 1/_T_1 look unusual.

Notably, at P = 1.91 and 2.63 GPa, 1/_T_1 become proportional to _T_^{5} below T ~ 0.6 K. We find that a point-node

[14] (open circles). The straight line is a guide for the eyes. The dotted curve depicts the relation 1/_T_1 × exp(−Δ_0/_kB_T_c) with Δ_0/_kB_T_c= 3.45, proposed by Yogi _et al._ (Ref. [42]).

The solid and dotted lines indicate the relation of 1/_T_1 × constant at high-temperature region and 1/_T_1 × T5 well below _T__{c}, respectively.

  model, with a low-energy (E) superconducting DOS proportional to E^{2}, can explain well these temperature dependences of 1/T_{1} below T_{c}(P). As plotted in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b) by solid curves, we obtained excellent agreement with experimental results below T_{c}(P). Here, we employed Anderson-Brinkmann-Morel (ABM) p-wave model [44, 45] to represent temperature dependence of 1/T_{1} below T_{c}(P) as

\[\frac{T_{1}(T_{c})}{T_{1}}=\frac{2}{k_{B}T}\!\int\left(\frac{N_{S}(E)}{N_{0}} \right)^{2}\!\!\!f(E)[1-f(E)]dE,\]

where N_{S}(E)/N_{0}\!=\!E/\sqrt{E^{2}\!-\!\Delta^{2}} with \Delta(\theta)\!=\!\Delta_{0} sin \theta. From fitting results, we obtained \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}\!=\!3.08 and 3.04 for P = 1.91 and 2.63 GPa, respectively. Since the superconducting transition temperatures at P\!=\!1.91 and 2.63 GPa are almost same, the values of \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c} are very close in both pressures. Recently, the p\!+\!h model [27] proposed to explain the results of thermal conductivity would give a T^{2}-like dependence since the DOS at low E is linear in E and is therefore not compatible with our results of 1/T_{1}\!\propto\!T^{5}.

## VIII Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented extensive ^{123}Sb-NQR studies on the normal and superconducting states in filled skutterudite heavy-fermion superconductor PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} under high pressure up to 3.82 GPa. From the temperature dependences of ^{123}Sb-NQR frequency and the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T_{1} under pressure, it is indicated that the crystal-electric-field splitting \Delta_{\rm CEF} between the ground-state \Gamma_{1} singlet and the first-excited-state \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} triplet decreases with increasing pressure. However, further application of pressure above P=3 GPa reveals that \Delta_{\rm CEF} does not change in 2 GPa<\!P\!<\!4 GPa. Concomitantly, similar pressure dependence is confirmed in the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}(P). Although the origin of these pressure dependences of \Delta_{\rm CEF} and T_{c} is still unknown, it suggests that superconductivity in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} is closely related to the \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} state. In the superconducting state at P\!=\!1.91 and 2.63 GPa, 1/T_{1} shows no coherence peak just below T_{c}(P), shows power-law temperature variations, and is proportional to at temperatures considerably below T_{c}(P). These data can be well represented by the gap model \Delta(\theta)\!=\!\Delta_{0} sin \theta with \Delta_{0} = 3.08k_{B}T_{c} and 3.04k_{B}T_{c} for P\!=\!1.91 and 2.63 GPa, respectively. This evidences that superconductivity in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} has point nodes in the gap function.

These results indicate that quadrupole/magnetic fluctuations induced by \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} triplet state may play a vital role for the occurrence of unconventional superconductivity in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}. We believe that present results shed further light on the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity in this compound and will stimulate further theoretical works.

###### Abstract

We report ^{123}Sb nuclear-quadrupole-resonance (NQR) measurements of the filled skutterudite heavy-fermion superconductor PrOs4Sb12 under high pressure. The temperature dependence of NQR frequency and the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T_{1} indicate that the crystal-electric-field splitting \Delta_{\rm CEF} between the ground-state \Gamma_{1} singlet and the first-excited-state \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} triplet decreases with increasing pressure. ac-susceptibility measurements indicate that the superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) also decreases with increasing pressure. However, above P\sim 2 GPa, both \Delta_{\rm CEF} and T_{c} do not depend on external pressure up to P = 3.82 GPa. These pressure dependences of \Delta_{\rm CEF} and T_{c} suggest an intimate relationship between quadrupole excitations associated with the \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} level and unconventional superconductivity in PrOs4Sb12. In the superconducting state, 1/T_{1} below T_{c}=1.55 and 1.57 K at P=1.91 and 2.63 GPa shows a power-law temperature variations and is proportional to T^{5} at temperatures considerably below T_{c}. These data can be well fitted by the gap model \Delta(\theta)=\Delta_{0} sin \theta, with \Delta_{0}=3.08k_{B}T_{c} and 3.04k_{B}T_{c} for P=1.91 and 2.63 GPa, respectively. The results indicate that there exist point nodes in the gap function.

  medium, respectively.[39, 40] The pressure at low temperatures was determined from the pressure dependence of the T_{c} values of Sn and/or Pb metals measured by a conventional four-terminal method. Temperature dependence of ac susceptibility is measured by a four-terminal method using NQR coil. Data below 1.4 K were collected using a ^{3}He/^{4}He dilution refrigerator at P=0 and a ^{3}He refrigerator under P=1.91 and 2.63 GPa, respectively.

The Sb nuclei have two isotopes of ^{121}Sb and ^{123}Sb with natural abundances of 57.3% and 42.7%, respectively. Since ^{121}Sb and ^{122}Sb have the nuclear spin I= 5/2 and 7/2, respectively, five Sb-NQR transitions are observed.[14] It has been confirmed that relaxation process at the Sb site is magnetic in origin.[14] In the present experiment, all measurements were done at the \pm3/2 \leftrightarrow +-5/2 transition (hereafter, 2\nu_{Q} transition for short) of the ^{123}Sb nucleus.

Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show a typical data set of ^{123}Sb-NQR recovery curves of 2\nu_{Q} transition to obtain relaxation time T_{1} which are measured at T=1.54 K just below T_{c}(P)= 1.57 K [Fig. 1(a)] and T=0.59 K well below T_{c}(P) [Fig. 1(b)] at P=2.63 GPa, respectively. Since there is an asymmetry parameter \eta at the position of Sb nucleus, T_{1} is determined by the theoretical curve of nuclear magnetization where the value of \eta is incorporated.[41] As seen in Fig. 1(b), to avoid possible heating due to the rf pulses, we used small amplitude rf pulses in the T_{1} measurements at very low temperatures. We confirmed the lack of a heating effect to T_{1} process by ensuring that the spin-echo intensity is not affected by an rf pulse with a slightly off-resonance frequency, which was applied before the \pi/2-\pi pulse sequence.

## III III. Uncommon superconductivity in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} at ambient pressure

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependences of 1/T_{1} at ambient pressure (solid circles). The ambient-pressure data are in excellent agreement with those reported previously (open circles).[14] At high temperatures, 100 K >T>T_{0}\sim 10 K, 1/T_{1} increase slightly and become temperature independent with decreasing temperature. In this case, the relaxation rate is dominated by the Pr 4/^{2}-derived localized magnetic moments on the \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} triplet state. With decreasing temperature below T_{0}\sim 10 K, 1/T_{1} starts to decrease because a depopulation of 4f electron at \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} triplet state occurs below T\leq\Delta_{\rm{CEF}}/k_{B}. Such a phenomenon is also confirmed in temperature dependence of 2\nu_{Q} resonance frequency as will be discussed later. Remarkably, just below T_{c}, the Hebel

Dotted lines indicate a relation of 1/T_{1}=const. Solid and dotted arrows indicate T_{c} and T_{0}, respectively. The inset shows temperature dependence of NQR frequency for 2\nu_{Q} transition at ambient pressure (solid circle) along with previous report (open circle) cited from literature (Ref. [14]).

The solid curves are theoretical fitting curve (see text).

  Slichter (coherence) peak is absent, indicating a non-s-wave superconductivity. At further low temperatures 1/T_{1} decreases exponentially.[14] Below T=0.4 K, 1/T_{1} become a constant, which is likely due to impurities. The present sample reproduces the previous results but shows smaller contribution of 1/T_{1}=const behavior at the lowest-temperature region than previous report,[14] which suggests that now samples have better quality.[24] The most likely cause for such T-independent 1/T_{1} is the presence of a small amount of magnetic impurity, which is pressure independent.

The inset of Fig. 2 shows the temperature dependence of the 2\nu_{Q} transition at P=0. T_{0} is the temperature at which the 2\nu_{Q} resonance frequency increases abruptly. Since the electrical field gradient (EFG) is predominantly determined by the on-site charge distribution, the NQR frequency is a powerful probe of the population of the ground/excited state. Indeed, in both PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} (Ref. [14]) and PrRu_{4}Sb_{12},[42]T_{0} is in good agreement with \Delta_{\rm CEF}/k_{B}. More recently, it has been suggested that the temperature dependence of NQR frequency can be accounted for by the EFG associated with the hexadecapole moment of the \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} state.[43] Therefore, it is concluded that the increase in the NQR frequency below T_{0} is due to the depopulation of f electron in the \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} state below this temperature. Here, we determined T_{0}=12 K at ambient pressure, below which 1/T_{1} and d\nu_{Q}/dT starts to decrease.

## IV Pressure dependence of \Delta_{\rm CEF} in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}

As discussed in Sec. III, we can estimate a value of \Delta_{\rm CEF} from the temperature dependence of NQR frequency. Figure 3 shows typical data set of temperature dependence of ^{123}Sb-NQR spectra measured at 2\nu_{Q} transition at P =2.63 GPa. As seen in Fig. 3, at P=2.63 GPa, ^{123}Sb-NQR spectrum has a symmetrical shape and the center of spectrum clearly shifts to higher frequency due to the depopulation of f electron in the \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} state below T_{0} (\propto\Delta_{\rm CEF}/k_{B}). Thus, we can determine the peak position of NQR spectra precisely even under high pressure. Figure 4 summarizes the temperature dependence of 2\nu_{Q} resonance frequency under various pressures. The temperature dependence of 2\nu_{Q} resonance frequency shifts to lower temperature under pressure indicating the decrease in \Delta_{\rm CEF} with increasing pressure but it does not change between P=2.63 and 3.82 GPa. As seen in the inset of Fig. 4, we define T_{0} at which df/dT starts to decrease steeply. Here, f denotes 2\nu_{Q} resonance frequency. We determined T_{0}(P)\sim 10, 7, and 7 K at P=0.84, 2.63, and 3.82 GPa, respectively. The pressure dependence of T_{0} is summarized in Fig. 6(a). Notably, it is found that T_{0} decreases with increasing pressure up to P\sim 2 GPa (Ref. [36]) but becomes pressure independent above P\sim 2 GPa.

## V Pressure dependence of T_{c} in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}

Next  the superconductivity in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}. To clarify their relationship more quantitatively, further experimental studies under high pressure are highly deserved.

On the theoretical side, it has been proposed that the superconductivity is mediated by the excitons due to the \Gamma_{4}^{(2)}-\Gamma_{1} quasiquartet [12]. In such case, T_{c}(P) would increase due to the enhancement of such interaction when \Delta_{\rm CEF} is reduced. However, clearly, our results indicate T_{c} decreases with increasing pressure and do not lend a straightforward support to the theory. Notably, recent Eliashberg theory revealed the \Delta_{\rm CEF} dependence of T_{c} in La_{1-x}Pr_{x}Os_{4}Sb_{12} system [34]. They indicate, in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, the reduction in \Delta_{\rm CEF} results a suppression of T_{c} due to the magnetic scattering. It is good agreement with present results. However, they also suggest that PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} is s-wave singlet superconductor [34] and is not compatible with present results. Further theories are called for.

## VI VI. Evolution of normal state electric properties in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} under pressure

Next, we discuss the pressure and temperature dependences of ^{123}Sb-NQR relaxation rate 1/T_{1}, which gives information on the dynamical electric and on superconducting properties. Figure 7 shows the temperature dependence of 1/T_{1}T at P=0, 1.91, 2.34, and 2.63 GPa. In Sec. IV, we concluded that \Delta_{\rm CEF} decreases with increasing pressure and it saturates above 2 GPa. Such a conclusion is also supported by the temperature dependence of 1/T_{1}T under pressure. The pressure effect appears below 4 K. At P=0, the reduction in 1/T_{1}T results in a peak structure in the plot of 1/T_{1}T versus T, which is due to the depopulation of the \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} state below T_{0}[14]. At high pressures, 1/T_{1}T continues to increase and the decreases in 1/T_{1}T occur at lower temperature, indicating the decrease in \Delta_{\rm CEF}. Since \Delta_{\rm CEF} decreases with increasing pressure, this may induce the increase in quadrupole fluctuations due to the f electron at the \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} state. These results are consistent with the conclusion inferred from the magnetization measurement [37]. At P=2.34 and 2.63 GPa, 1/T_{1}T in the whole temperature regions has almost the same value. Thus, the peak position and T_{c} found in the temperature dependence of 1/T_{1}T are unchanged above P\sim 2 GPa, and these are consistent with the pressure dependence of T_{0} and T_{c} determined by the temperature dependences of 2\nu_{Q} transition and ac susceptibility as discussed in Secs. I-V.

## VII VII. Superconducting properties under pressure

Next, we discuss the superconducting property in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} under pressure. Figure 8 shows the temperature dependence of 1/T_{1} at P=0, 1.91, and 2.63 GPa. As discussed in Sec. III, the 1/T_{1} is T independent above T_{0}, indicating that the relaxation in the high-temperature region is dominated by the Pr 4/^{2}-derived localized magnetic moments [36]. With decreasing temperature below T_{0}, 1/T_{1}

  starts to decrease. At P = 1.91 and 2.63 GPa, the reduction in 1/_T_1 below T0 to _T__{c} becomes smaller compared to ambient-pressure data since the contribution of the excitation gap \Delta_{\rm CEF} in 1/_T_1 becomes smaller under pressure. Notably, just below _T__{c}(_P_), no coherence peak is observed at high pressures, even though _T__{c} differs in each pressures. This indicates that the lack of coherence peak in PrOs4Sb12 is intrinsic property.

The temperature dependences of 1/_T_1 below _T__{c}(_P_) at high pressures are markedly different from that at ambient pressure. As seen in solid line in Fig. 8, 1/_T_1 at P = 1.91 and 2.63 GPa decreases in a power law like temperature dependence below _T__{c}(_P_). However, at ambient pressure, 1/_T_1 decreases exponentially as indicated by dotted line in Fig. 8. What is the origin of these different temperature dependences of 1/_T_1 below _T__{c} at ambient and under pressures? One possible scenario is provided below. At ambient pressure, the larger excitation gap \Delta_{\rm CEF} contributes to the reduction in 1/_T_1 below _T__{c}, which make the temperature dependence of 1/_T_1 exponential like across _T__{c}. Actually, at P = 1.91, 2.34, and 2.63 GPa, the anomaly at _T__{c}(_P_) in temperature dependence of 1/_T_1 becomes clearer compared to ambient-pressure data since the \Delta_{\rm CEF} decreases under pressure and its contribution to 1/_T_1 under pressure becomes smaller. So, we can determine _T__{c}(_P_) from the temperature dependence of 1/_T_1 as seen in Figs. 8 and 9. Such a scenario is also supported by our previous NQR studies in the substitution systems Pr(Os1-Ru)4Sb12351 was confirmed that \Delta_{\rm CEF} becomes larger when Ru is substituted for Os site.[22, 35] As a result, in Pr(Os1-Ru)4Sb12, it becomes more difficult to determine _T__{c} in the temperature dependence of 1/_T_1 compared to PrOs4Sb12 due to the increase in the contribution of excitation gap \Delta_{\rm CEF} in 1/_T_1 across _T__{c}.[35] Thus, it is suggested that the excitation gap \Delta_{\rm CEF}/k_{B} >= 10 K may make temperature dependence of 1/_T_1 look unusual.

Notably, at P = 1.91 and 2.63 GPa, 1/_T_1 become proportional to _T_^{5} below T ~ 0.6 K. We find that a point-node

[14] (open circles). The straight line is a guide for the eyes. The dotted curve depicts the relation 1/_T_1 × exp(−Δ_0/_kB_T_c) with Δ_0/_kB_T_c= 3.45, proposed by Yogi _et al._ (Ref. [42]).

[14] (open circles). Solid arrows indicate _T__{c}(_P_).

The solid and dotted lines indicate the relation of 1/_T_1 × constant at high-temperature region and 1/_T_1 × T5 well below _T__{c}, respectively.

  model, with a low-energy (E) superconducting DOS proportional to E^{2}, can explain well these temperature dependences of 1/T_{1} below T_{c}(P). As plotted in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b) by solid curves, we obtained excellent agreement with experimental results below T_{c}(P). Here, we employed Anderson-Brinkmann-Morel (ABM) p-wave model [44, 45] to represent temperature dependence of 1/T_{1} below T_{c}(P) as

\[\frac{T_{1}(T_{c})}{T_{1}}=\frac{2}{k_{B}T}\!\int\left(\frac{N_{S}(E)}{N_{0}} \right)^{2}\!\!\!f(E)[1-f(E)]dE,\]

where N_{S}(E)/N_{0}\!=\!E/\sqrt{E^{2}\!-\!\Delta^{2}} with \Delta(\theta)\!=\!\Delta_{0} sin \theta. From fitting results, we obtained \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}\!=\!3.08 and 3.04 for P = 1.91 and 2.63 GPa, respectively. Since the superconducting transition temperatures at P\!=\!1.91 and 2.63 GPa are almost same, the values of \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c} are very close in both pressures. Recently, the p\!+\!h model [27] proposed to explain the results of thermal conductivity would give a T^{2}-like dependence since the DOS at low E is linear in E and is therefore not compatible with our results of 1/T_{1}\!\propto\!T^{5}.

## VIII Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented extensive ^{123}Sb-NQR studies on the normal and superconducting states in filled skutterudite heavy-fermion superconductor PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} under high pressure up to 3.82 GPa. From the temperature dependences of ^{123}Sb-NQR frequency and the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T_{1} under pressure, it is indicated that the crystal-electric-field splitting \Delta_{\rm CEF} between the ground-state \Gamma_{1} singlet and the first-excited-state \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} triplet decreases with increasing pressure. However, further application of pressure above P=3 GPa reveals that \Delta_{\rm CEF} does not change in 2 GPa<\!P\!<\!4 GPa. Concomitantly, similar pressure dependence is confirmed in the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}(P). Although the origin of these pressure dependences of \Delta_{\rm CEF} and T_{c} is still unknown, it suggests that superconductivity in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} is closely related to the \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} state. In the superconducting state at P\!=\!1.91 and 2.63 GPa, 1/T_{1} shows no coherence peak just below T_{c}(P), shows power-law temperature variations, and is proportional to at temperatures considerably below T_{c}(P). These data can be well represented by the gap model \Delta(\theta)\!=\!\Delta_{0} sin \theta with \Delta_{0} = 3.08k_{B}T_{c} and 3.04k_{B}T_{c} for P\!=\!1.91 and 2.63 GPa, respectively. This evidences that superconductivity in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} has point nodes in the gap function.

These results indicate that quadrupole/magnetic fluctuations induced by \Gamma_{4}^{(2)} triplet state may play a vital role for the occurrence of unconventional superconductivity in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}. We believe that present results shed further light on the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity in this compound and will stimulate further theoretical works.
