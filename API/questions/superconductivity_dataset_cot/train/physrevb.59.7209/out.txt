###### Abstract

The results of a neutron-diffraction study of the HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} structure at ambient pressure and under external pressure at different extra oxygen concentrations are presented. The results have been analyzed together with the data of previous investigations. It is shown that in the cation-stoichiometric samples the O_{\delta} oxygen is only present in the center of the mercury layer, T_{c} is parabolically dependent on \delta, and T_{c,\max} is obtained at \delta_{\rm opt}= 0.13\pm 0.01. The influence of pressure on the structure strongly depends on the doping level. At low oxygen content (\delta\approx 0.06), the compression of the structure is practically uniform. An increase of the extra oxygen content to 0.19 (overdoped state) results in the larger compression of the apical Cu-O(2) and Ba-O_{\delta} distances, while the HgO_{2} dumb-bell as well as the distance between Ba and O belonging to the (CuO_{2}) layer become practically pressure independent. These results are in agreement with models, in which the effect of the charge transfer from the reservoir to the (CuO_{2}) layers does not play a dominant role in the T_{c} increase with pressure at low and optimal \delta values, while in the overdoped state the charge transfer is enhanced under pressure, thus inducing the T_{c} decrease.

## I Introduction

The HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} phase (Hg-1201) is at the moment one of the most thoroughly studied high-temperature superconductors (HTSC's) from the point of view of the relationship between atomic structure and physical properties. Its structure, presented in Fig. 1, can be described in terms of four layers,1 (HgO_{\delta})(BaO)(CuO_{2})(BaO), stacked along the c axis of the tetragonal unit cell. The (HgO_{\delta}) and (CuO_{2}) layers are flat, while the Ba and O atoms in the (BaO) layer are displaced \sim 0.9 A from each other along the c axis due to the interaction of these atoms with the neighboring layers. Owing to the high crystallographic symmetry and the small number of atoms, the structure has only a few variable parameters, which can be determined with a high degree of reliability from structural refinements based on diffraction data. Unlike the majority of the other HTSC compounds, such peculiarities as stacking faults, structure modulations, large static displacements of atoms, etc., are practically absent in Hg -1201.

It is generally assumed that the (HgO_{\delta}) layer acts as charge reservoir for the (CuO_{2}) planes. The insertion of O_{\delta} oxygen into it leads to the appearance of charge carriers (holes) in the (CuO_{2}) layer. By adjusting the oxygen content in the (HgO_{\delta}) layer, the doping level of Hg-1201 can be easily varied over a wide range, from strongly underdoped to highly overdoped states of which some are nonsuperconducting.

Both functional and quantitative relationships between T_{c} and \delta are still controversial. The data published (see, for example, Refs. 2 and 3) do not contradict the universal parabolic dependence of Presland _et al._:4

\[T_{c} = T_{c,\max}[1-q(\delta-\delta_{\rm opt})^{2}\},\]

although recent results5 are not in agreement with the above equation. The quantitative disagreements are mostly due to the uncertainty in the \delta_{\rm opt}, the value at which the maximum superconducting transition temperature, T_{c,\max} is observed. The Hg-1201 structural refinements based on powder neutron-diffraction data, gave \delta_{\rm opt} values comprised between 0.06 (Ref. 6) and 0.18.2

 Another question about Hg-1201 still remaining without a clear answer, is the reason for the variation of T_{c} with increasing external pressure. Cao _et al._7 and more recently Qiu _et al._8 have measured T_{c} in a wide \delta range and shown that dT_{c}/dP strongly depends on the doping level. The underdoped and optimally doped Hg-1201 samples exhibit initially an increase of T_{c} with pressure up to 6-8 GPa with dT_{c}/dP = 2 K/GPa, while the latter rate is smaller and becomes even negative for overdoped samples. These authors concluded that the superconducting region seems to shrink significantly with P, and, the T_{c} vs \delta dependence changes from inverse parabolic at ambient pressure to truncated trianglelike above 10 GPa. The T_{c,\max} under pressure was found to be nearly \delta independent around the optimal doping level, which supports the idea put forward in Ref. 8 that the pressure-induced charge transfer only plays a minor role in the pressure effect on T_{c}.

The experimental T_{c}(P) dependence was analyzed in several theoretical articles. In Ref. 9, the electronic band-structure calculations were carried out and the correct sign for the lattice anisotropic compressibility was obtained. The value of T_{c} is related to the position of van Hove singularity, depending on the carrier concentration as well as on the external pressure. In Ref. 10 the authors supposed that pressure-induced changes in T_{c} are related to two effects: the charge transfer from the reservoir to the (CuO_{2}) layer and the dependence on P of the energy-gap value. The detailed analysis of the experimental data on the influence of pressure and doping level was carried out in Ref. 11. These authors showed that in terms of the indirect-exchange model the observed T_{c}(P,\delta) dependence cannot be explained without considering that the oxygen [in the (CuO_{2}) layer and those close to it] has the role of an intermediary in the process of the electron coupling. From this follows the necessity of considering the structural reorganization close to the (CuO_{2}) layer while analyzing the T_{c}(P,\delta) dependence. Thus, the importance of determining the Hg-1201 structure with different doping levels (under, optimally and overdoped) as a function of pressure is obvious.

Until now the data on the influence of external pressure on the Hg-1201 structure were only obtained for the optimally doped composition (\delta_{\rm opt}(\approx 0.12), up to 0.6 GPa (Ref. 12) and up to 5.1 GPa, [13] and partly for the composition with \delta_{\rm opt}(\approx 0.19 (overdoped state). [13] The analysis of the results showed that the main effect of pressure is the shortening of the apical Cu-O(2) bond length, while the Hg-O distance in the HgO_{2} dumb-bell is practically pressure independent. For example, the relative variations of these distances are 3.7 \pm 0.8% and 0.4 \pm 0.8%, respectively. [13] These results were not unexpected because at ambient pressure the apical Cu-O bond length is unusually large with respect to those found in other Cu-based high-T_{c} oxides (for example, almost 0.5 A larger than in the Y123 compound). Consequently, this bond is weak. On the contrary, the chemical bonds in the HgO_{2} dumb-bell are strongly covalent, and this is the main reason for its small variation under pressure.

In this article the results of powder neutron-diffraction structural experiments are presented. They have been carried out on Hg-1201 samples with \delta(\approx 0.06 (underdoped state) and \delta(\approx 0.19 (overdoped state) under external pressures up to about 0.8 GPa. The results are compared with our earlier data [13] for the optimal and overdoped compositions. The structure of Hg-1201 at ambient pressure has also been re-termined and compared to previous work. [14] The analysis of all these structural data has led us to comprehension of the T_{c} vs \delta dependence.

## II Experiment

Three samples of HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} were prepared according to the procedure described in Ref. 15. The syntheses were performed in sealed silica tubes in a furnace with controlled temperature gradient. The sample in the underdoped state (sample A, T_{c}(\approx 75 K) in the final stage of the preparation process was annealed in argon flow at 350 ^{\circ}C. Sample B which is optimally doped (T_{c}(\approx 97 K), was annealed at 250 ^{\circ}C in 1 bar oxygen atmosphere. The third sample (C, overdoped, T_{c}(\approx 70 K) was annealed at 270 ^{\circ}C under an oxygen pressure of 90 bar. The preparation method, the superconducting properties, and the unit-cell parameters of these samples were similar to the Hg-1201 samples, previously studied with the HRFD diffractometer in Dubna at ambient pressure. [14]

Neutron-diffraction patterns of A and C samples were measured at the D2B diffractometer at the ILL (Grenoble) at several values of the external pressure, while sample B was measured only at ambient pressure. A high-pressure cell of the "cylinder-piston" type with Fluor Inert liquid as the pressure-transmitting medium was used to generate the desired pressures on the sample. The diffraction patterns in the range 20^{\circ}<2 \theta<150^{\circ} were obtained at 0, 0.5, and 0.85 GPa for sample A and at 0, 0.5, and 0.7 GPa for sample C. No peaks from impurity phases were found in any of the diffraction patterns. The total number of the Bragg reflections used in the refinement, exceeded 100 in each case. A typical diffraction pattern measured in the high-pressure cell is shown in Fig. 2. Additionally, the diffraction patterns from samples B and C were taken at normal conditions without the cell. A diffraction pattern of sample A at normal conditions was also obtained with the HRFD diffractometer at Dubna in the range of d spacing 0.77-2.12 A in order to make a comparison with the previously obtained data, which would reveal possible systematic errors.

Figure 2: The diffraction pattern of sample C, measured at D2B at a pressure P = 0.5 GPa and analyzed with the Rietveld method.

  The Rietveld refinements were carried out with the use of the gsas and mria programs. The measured intensity of scattered neutrons was corrected for the relatively strong absorption of neutrons in Hg-1201 due mainly to the Hg atoms. The neutron absorption cross sections from Ref. 16 were used. Several hypotheses for the structural model were checked during the refinements for all compositions. They were: a deficiency in the occupation of the Hg site, the possibility of splitting of the Ba site along the c axis, the presence of static displacements of Hg in the basal plane and of O(2) in a plane parallel to the basal plane, the disordering of O(3) in the basal plane along the diagonal of the unit cell, and the possibility of the existence of additional oxygen in the (0,0.5,0) or (_x_,0.5,0) positions. None of these hypotheses were found to be statistically significant. This is in very good agreement with the conclusions drawn recently in Ref. 17. These authors reported the detailed x-ray-diffraction study of 15 Hg-1201 samples synthesized in sealed quartz tubes with different nominal Hg and Cu concentrations.

Therefore, the refinements were carried out using the standard structural model (see, for example, Ref. 14). The occupancy of the mercury position was fixed at 1 and the oxygen O(3) thermal parameter was fixed as isotropic at the value of 0.8 A.2 The thermal parameters of the other atoms were refined in the anisotropic model according to the respective site symmetry. Since the precise determination of the thermal parameters was not the scope of the present study, the refined values of the thermal parameters are presented in the Table 1 only for the optimally doped compound. No significant changes for these parameters were observed in the other refinements. The results for the other compositions and at different values of the external pressure are presented in Tables 2 and 3.

  mation of two holes in the (CuO_{2}) layer per oxygen atom inserted into the Hg layer, the standard valences of the atoms are: V_{\rm Ba}=V_{\rm Hg}=+2, V_{\rm O}=-2, and the optimal number of holes in the (CuO_{2}) layer is n_{\rm opt}=0.16. The study of the effect of doping by fluorine, instead of oxygen, in Hg-1201, carried out by Abakumov _et al._[19] showed that the same T_{c} values in the oxygen- and fluorine-doped compounds (HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} and HgBa_{2}CuF_{\gamma}) are obtained for 2\,\delta\approx\gamma. As the charge of F is hardly different from -1, the charge of the extra oxygen is equal to -2. In order to explain the difference between the \delta_{\rm opt} and n_{\rm opt} Abakumov _et al._[19] made the speculation that the holes induced by the insertion of oxygen are distributed over the (CuO_{2}) layers and other parts of the Hg-1201 structure, e.g., the HgO_{2} dumb-bell.

The obtained absolute values of the interatomic distances and the range of their variations for increasing \delta are in good agreement with the values published in previous neutron-diffraction studies.

### Pressure dependence of the structural parameters

The variations of the a and c unit-cell parameters and the main interatomic distances in Hg-1201 as the function of pressure are shown in Figs. 4-6. For the optimally doped sample the points corresponding to ambient pressure (measured at D2B) are shown and the line slopes correspond to the compressibilities derived from Ref. [13]. The compressibilities of the unit-cell parameters and the main interatomic distances in Hg-1201, defined as \kappa_{q}= -(1/q)\,\Delta q/\Delta P (10^{-3}/{\rm GPa}), where q is the specific parameter, are presented in Table 4 and in Fig. 7. In order to calculate \Delta q/\Delta P, the linear least-squares fits of the experimental points were used. The fits are shown in Figs. 4-6. For comparison, the compressibilities calculated from the data of Ref. [12], corresponding to the optimally doped Hg -1201 sample, are also presented in Table 4.

The pressure dependence of the Hg-1201 unit-cell parameters show that the occupation of the O(3) position does not

The value of \kappa_{c} in sample A is higher than those in B and C samples. This can be attributed to the comparatively higher compressibility of the Hg-O(2) bond length in the reduced structure of sample A. The compressibility along the c axis in samples B and C is almost fully determined by the \kappa_{\text{Cu-O(2)}}. For all three levels of doping the compressibility anisotropy is quite high, reaching \kappa_{c}/\kappa_{a}\approx 1.47 for sample A. The compressibility becomes less anisotropic when extra oxygen content \delta increases: \kappa_{c}/\kappa_{a} decreases from sample A (1.47\pm 0.02) to C

  (1.36 +- 0.03). This behavior is due to the fact that the Hg-1201 structure becomes more isotropic when the O(3) site occupancy increases.

It is remarkable that the compressibilities of the in-plane Cu-O(1) and Hg-O(3) bonds are practically d independent, while the compressibility of the apical bond distances, Cu-O(2) and Hg-O(2), are strongly dependent upon the doping level. The compressibility of the apical Hg-O(2) bond is close to k_{c} for sample A, but with increasing doping level (samples B and C), it becomes practically incompressible. This was observed in the pressure range up to 5.07 and 2.37 GPa for the optimally and overdoped compositions, respectively.[13] The HgO2 dumb-bell is a very rigid element of the structure. The results presented here show that the length of the Hg-O(2) bond depends on the extra oxygen content in the Hg plane: an increase of the coordination number of the Hg atoms results in an increase of the apical Hg-O(2) bond distance. This bond becomes incompressible with the presence of the significantly large amount of O(3) in the Hg layer. This behavior may seem unusual, however, bond lengths increase when the coordination number of the cation increases and this is exactly what happens to the coordination number of Hg for increasing d. It is possible that some bending of the HgO2 dumb-bell occurs. The departure of the Hg atom from the (0,0,0) position may lead to an apparent shortening of the bond length. Another explanation can be found by analyzing the behavior of the other bond distances in the structure. It is obvious that the compressibility of the Hg-O(2) bond should depend on the compressibilities of the other bonds, such as Cu-O(2) and Ba-O(3) [O(2)], which become more compressible for increasing of the O(3) content.

The compressibility of the apical Cu-O(2) bond length increases when the O(3) content increases despite the shortening of this bond for larger d values. This bond length shortens in these samples proportionally to the decrease of the c axis length, i.e., the pressure dependence of the apical Cu-O(2) bond length for all three types of samples reproduces the pressure dependence of the c unit-cell parameter. The value _k_Cu-O(2) is greater than k_{c} which in part is due to the low value of _k_H2-O(2). If _k_H2-O(2)= 0, then we should have _k_Cu-O(2)= k_{c}(_c_/2_Cu-O(2)), where _I_Cu-O(2) is the length of the Cu-O2 bond.

The compressibilities of the Ba-O distances strongly depend on the doping level. The compressibility of the Ba-O(3) distance becomes larger when the doping level increases. For the A and B samples the compressibility of this distance corresponds approximately to k_{c} , while for the C sample it is almost 2.5 times larger than k_{c} , i.e., for increasing pressure the Ba atom in the overdoped sample is rapidly moving toward the basal plane. The compressibility of the Ba-O(2) bond length becomes also larger for increases of the extra oxygen content. The unexpected result is that the Ba-O(1) distance [between Ba and O of the (CuO2) layers] becomes incompressible in the overdoped state. This distance does not change under pressure, and the compressibility has even a small negative value, while in the underdoped and optimally doped samples this bond decreases for increasing pressure.

Figures 7 and 1 summarize the variations of selected bond compressibilities with the change of the doping level. An increase of the O(3) content results in larger compressibilities of the Ba-O(3) and Cu-O(2) distances, while the Hg-O(2) and Ba-O(1) ones become practically incompressible. Therefore, pressure induces anisotropic effects (which depend on the doping level) on the structure of Hg-1201 compound and, in particular, on the local arrangement of the (CuO2) layers which are responsible for superconductivity. In the overdoped state the separation between these layers and neighboring Ba cations does not decrease under pressure, while the apical O(2) anions shift highly toward the Cu

  cations. In the under- and optimally doped structures pressure causes the shortening of the Ba-O(1) separation and a smaller compression of the Cu-O(2) bond. Such variation of the atomic interactions due to the change of extra oxygen content can be one of the reasons for the enhancement of the charge transfer from the reservoir block to the conducting (CuO2) layers in the overdoped state in comparison with under and optimally-doped superconductors.

One of the most discussed questions in the literature is why T_{c}(P) for the Hg-1201 phases varies differently with the different doping level. This subject is discussed in a few theoretical articles.[70, 11, 18] Even though each is based on various models, all conclude that there are two main reasons the T_{c} change: the increase of T_{c,\max} in Eq. (1) and the variation of the charge-carrier density in the (CuO2) layer due to the charge transfer from the reservoir. From the experimental data on the T_{c} vs P and \delta dependence presented in Ref. [7] it follows that dT_{c}/dP\approx\,const\approx\,2 K/GPa for \delta\approx\,\delta_{\rm opt} at least up to 1.5 GPa pressures. The analysis of Eq. (1) shows that in this case the pressure-induced charge transfer, dn/dP, would have to decrease for increasing \delta, vanishing at \delta = \delta_{\rm opt}. The absolute value of the charge transfer is very small, not higher than 0.002 holes/GPa for the underdoped state.[10, 20] From the homogeneous character of the structure compression revealed in the present study one can conclude that the effect of the charge transfer from the reservoir to the (CuO2) layers does not play the dominant role in the Hg-1201 structure under pressure at \delta\approx\,\delta_{\rm opt}. At the same time, the strong shift of the Ba atoms in the overdoped state toward the (HgO_{\delta}) layer under applied pressure may be considered as the signature of a significant charge transfer into the (CuO2) layer, leading to a stronger overdoping, thus decreasing T_{c}.

## IV Conclusions

In the present article we have presented a neutron-diffraction study of Hg-1201 under high pressure at low and high extra oxygen concentrations in the Hg layer (under- and overdoped states). The results are analyzed together with previous data.[13, 14] The main conclusions are as follows:

The superconductor HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta}, prepared according to the procedure described in Ref. [15] is a cation-stoichiometric compound exhibiting the highest T_{c} at the oxygen concentration in the Hg layer \delta_{\rm opt}=\,0.13\pm 0.01. This oxygen is only situated in the center of the Hg layer. The value of \delta_{\rm opt} was determined by the measurements of seven Hg-1201 at three diffractometers, two of which (D2B and 3T2) are of the classical type with \lambda=\,const, while the third (HRFD) utilizes the time-of-flight technique. All the measured points of the T_{c}(\delta) dependence lie on one curve which strongly indicates that the \delta_{\rm opt} value is realistic.

At low O_{\delta} concentration the Hg-1201 structure compresses uniformly, i.e., the compressibilities of the main interatomic distances correspond to the unit-cell compressibility. However, at higher O_{\delta} concentrations the Hg-O(2) and Ba-O(1) bonds become practically incompressible, while the Cu-O(2) and Ba-O(3) undergo a strong compression. The analysis of the interatomic distances variations allows us to propose that in the under and optimally doped states the charge transfer from the reservoir to the (CuO2) layers plays a minor role. The enhancement of T_{c} under pressure is due to an increase of the T_{c,\max} value. The decrease of T_{c} under applied pressure for the overdoped Hg-1201 superconductor may be explained by charge-transfer enhancing overdoping.

###### Abstract

The results of a neutron-diffraction study of the HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} structure at ambient pressure and under external pressure at different extra oxygen concentrations are presented. The results have been analyzed together with the data of previous investigations. It is shown that in the cation-stoichiometric samples the O_{\delta} oxygen is only present in the center of the mercury layer, T_{c} is parabolically dependent on \delta, and T_{c,\max} is obtained at \delta_{\rm opt}= 0.13\pm 0.01. The influence of pressure on the structure strongly depends on the doping level. At low oxygen content (\delta\approx 0.06), the compression of the structure is practically uniform. An increase of the extra oxygen content to 0.19 (overdoped state) results in the larger compression of the apical Cu-O(2) and Ba-O_{\delta} distances, while the HgO_{2} dumb-bell as well as the distance between Ba and O belonging to the (CuO_{2}) layer become practically pressure independent. These results are in agreement with models, in which the effect of the charge transfer from the reservoir to the (CuO_{2}) layers does not play a dominant role in the T_{c} increase with pressure at low and optimal \delta values, while in the overdoped state the charge transfer is enhanced under pressure, thus inducing the T_{c} decrease.

## I Introduction

The HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} phase (Hg-1201) is at the moment one of the most thoroughly studied high-temperature superconductors (HTSC's) from the point of view of the relationship between atomic structure and physical properties. Its structure, presented in Fig. 1, can be described in terms of four layers,1 (HgO_{\delta})(BaO)(CuO_{2})(BaO), stacked along the c axis of the tetragonal unit cell. The (HgO_{\delta}) and (CuO_{2}) layers are flat, while the Ba and O atoms in the (BaO) layer are displaced \sim 0.9 A from each other along the c axis due to the interaction of these atoms with the neighboring layers. Owing to the high crystallographic symmetry and the small number of atoms, the structure has only a few variable parameters, which can be determined with a high degree of reliability from structural refinements based on diffraction data. Unlike the majority of the other HTSC compounds, such peculiarities as stacking faults, structure modulations, large static displacements of atoms, etc., are practically absent in Hg -1201.

Footnote 1: The \delta-\delta ratio is 0.0163-1829/99/59(10)/7209(7)/515.00

It is generally assumed that the (HgO_{\delta}) layer acts as charge reservoir for the (CuO_{2}) planes. The insertion of O_{\delta} oxygen into it leads to the appearance of charge carriers (holes) in the (CuO_{2}) layer. By adjusting the oxygen content in the (HgO_{\delta}) layer, the doping level of Hg-1201 can be easily varied over a wide range, from strongly underdoped to highly overdoped states of which some are nonsuperconducting.

Both functional and quantitative relationships between T_{c} and \delta are still controversial. The data published (see, for example, Refs. 2 and 3) do not contradict the universal parabolic dependence of Presland _et al._:4

\[T_{c} = T_{c,\max}[1-q(\delta-\delta_{\rm opt})^{2}\},\]

although recent results5 are not in agreement with the above equation. The quantitative disagreements are mostly due to the uncertainty in the \delta_{\rm opt}, the value at which the maximum superconducting transition temperature, T_{c,\max} is observed. The Hg-1201 structural refinements based on powder neutron-diffraction data, gave \delta_{\rm opt} values comprised between 0.06 (Ref. 6) and 0.18.2

Figure 1: Schematic representation of the Hg-1201 structure (a half of the unit cell). The values of the compressibilities obtained in the present paper (see Sec. III.2) of the selected bond distances are written on the left for the underdoped sample, and on the right for the overdoped sample.

 Another question about Hg-1201 still remaining without a clear answer, is the reason for the variation of T_{c} with increasing external pressure. Cao _et al._7 and more recently Qiu _et al._8 have measured T_{c} in a wide \delta range and shown that dT_{c}/dP strongly depends on the doping level. The underdoped and optimally doped Hg-1201 samples exhibit initially an increase of T_{c} with pressure up to 6-8 GPa with dT_{c}/dP = 2 K/GPa, while the latter rate is smaller and becomes even negative for overdoped samples. These authors concluded that the superconducting region seems to shrink significantly with P, and, the T_{c} vs \delta dependence changes from inverse parabolic at ambient pressure to truncated trianglelike above 10 GPa. The T_{c,\max} under pressure was found to be nearly \delta independent around the optimal doping level, which supports the idea put forward in Ref. 8 that the pressure-induced charge transfer only plays a minor role in the pressure effect on T_{c}.

The experimental T_{c}(P) dependence was analyzed in several theoretical articles. In Ref. 9, the electronic band-structure calculations were carried out and the correct sign for the lattice anisotropic compressibility was obtained. The value of T_{c} is related to the position of van Hove singularity, depending on the carrier concentration as well as on the external pressure. In Ref. 10 the authors supposed that pressure-induced changes in T_{c} are related to two effects: the charge transfer from the reservoir to the (CuO_{2}) layer and the dependence on P of the energy-gap value. The detailed analysis of the experimental data on the influence of pressure and doping level was carried out in Ref. 11. These authors showed that in terms of the indirect-exchange model the observed T_{c}(P,\delta) dependence cannot be explained without considering that the oxygen [in the (CuO_{2}) layer and those close to it] has the role of an intermediary in the process of the electron coupling. From this follows the necessity of considering the structural reorganization close to the (CuO_{2}) layer while analyzing the T_{c}(P,\delta) dependence. Thus, the importance of determining the Hg-1201 structure with different doping levels (under, optimally and overdoped) as a function of pressure is obvious.

Until now the data on the influence of external pressure on the Hg-1201 structure were only obtained for the optimally doped composition (\delta_{\rm opt}(\approx 0.12), up to 0.6 GPa (Ref. 12) and up to 5.1 GPa, [13] and partly for the composition with \delta_{\rm opt}(\approx 0.19 (overdoped state). [13] The analysis of the results showed that the main effect of pressure is the shortening of the apical Cu-O(2) bond length, while the Hg-O distance in the HgO_{2} dumb-bell is practically pressure independent. For example, the relative variations of these distances are 3.7 \pm 0.8% and 0.4 \pm 0.8%, respectively. [13] These results were not unexpected because at ambient pressure the apical Cu-O bond length is unusually large with respect to those found in other Cu-based high-T_{c} oxides (for example, almost 0.5 A larger than in the Y123 compound). Consequently, this bond is weak. On the contrary, the chemical bonds in the HgO_{2} dumb-bell are strongly covalent, and this is the main reason for its small variation under pressure.

In this article the results of powder neutron-diffraction structural experiments are presented. They have been carried out on Hg-1201 samples with \delta(\approx 0.06 (underdoped state) and \delta(\approx 0.19 (overdoped state) under external pressures up to about 0.8 GPa. The results are compared with our earlier data [13] for the optimal and overdoped compositions. The structure of Hg-1201 at ambient pressure has also been re-termined and compared to previous work. [14] The analysis of all these structural data has led us to comprehension of the T_{c} vs \delta dependence.

## II Experiment

Three samples of HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} were prepared according to the procedure described in Ref. 15. The syntheses were performed in sealed silica tubes in a furnace with controlled temperature gradient. The sample in the underdoped state (sample A, T_{c}(\approx 75 K) in the final stage of the preparation process was annealed in argon flow at 350 ^{\circ}C. Sample B which is optimally doped (T_{c}(\approx 97 K), was annealed at 250 ^{\circ}C in 1 bar oxygen atmosphere. The third sample (C, overdoped, T_{c}(\approx 70 K) was annealed at 270 ^{\circ}C under an oxygen pressure of 90 bar. The preparation method, the superconducting properties, and the unit-cell parameters of these samples were similar to the Hg-1201 samples, previously studied with the HRFD diffractometer in Dubna at ambient pressure. [14]

Neutron-diffraction patterns of A and C samples were measured at the D2B diffractometer at the ILL (Grenoble) at several values of the external pressure, while sample B was measured only at ambient pressure. A high-pressure cell of the "cylinder-piston" type with Fluor Inert liquid as the pressure-transmitting medium was used to generate the desired pressures on the sample. The diffraction patterns in the range 20^{\circ}<2 \theta<150^{\circ} were obtained at 0, 0.5, and 0.85 GPa for sample A and at 0, 0.5, and 0.7 GPa for sample C. No peaks from impurity phases were found in any of the diffraction patterns. The total number of the Bragg reflections used in the refinement, exceeded 100 in each case. A typical diffraction pattern measured in the high-pressure cell is shown in Fig. 2. Additionally, the diffraction patterns from samples B and C were taken at normal conditions without the cell. A diffraction pattern of sample A at normal conditions was also obtained with the HRFD diffractometer at Dubna in the range of d spacing 0.77-2.12 A in order to make a comparison with the previously obtained data, which would reveal possible systematic errors.

Figure 2: The diffraction pattern of sample C, measured at D2B at a pressure P = 0.5 GPa and analyzed with the Rietveld method.

  The Rietveld refinements were carried out with the use of the gsas and mria programs. The measured intensity of scattered neutrons was corrected for the relatively strong absorption of neutrons in Hg-1201 due mainly to the Hg atoms. The neutron absorption cross sections from Ref. 16 were used. Several hypotheses for the structural model were checked during the refinements for all compositions. They were: a deficiency in the occupation of the Hg site, the possibility of splitting of the Ba site along the c axis, the presence of static displacements of Hg in the basal plane and of O(2) in a plane parallel to the basal plane, the disordering of O(3) in the basal plane along the diagonal of the unit cell, and the possibility of the existence of additional oxygen in the (0,0.5,0) or (_x_,0.5,0) positions. None of these hypotheses were found to be statistically significant. This is in very good agreement with the conclusions drawn recently in Ref. 17. These authors reported the detailed x-ray-diffraction study of 15 Hg-1201 samples synthesized in sealed quartz tubes with different nominal Hg and Cu concentrations.

Therefore, the refinements were carried out using the standard structural model (see, for example, Ref. 14). The occupancy of the mercury position was fixed at 1 and the oxygen O(3) thermal parameter was fixed as isotropic at the value of 0.8 A.2 The thermal parameters of the other atoms were refined in the anisotropic model according to the respective site symmetry. Since the precise determination of the thermal parameters was not the scope of the present study, the refined values of the thermal parameters are presented in the Table 1 only for the optimally doped compound. No significant changes for these parameters were observed in the other refinements. The results for the other compositions and at different values of the external pressure are presented in Tables 2 and 3.

  mation of two holes in the (CuO_{2}) layer per oxygen atom inserted into the Hg layer, the standard valences of the atoms are: V_{\rm Ba}=V_{\rm Hg}=+2, V_{\rm O}=-2, and the optimal number of holes in the (CuO_{2}) layer is n_{\rm opt}=0.16. The study of the effect of doping by fluorine, instead of oxygen, in Hg-1201, carried out by Abakumov _et al._[19] showed that the same T_{c} values in the oxygen- and fluorine-doped compounds (HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} and HgBa_{2}CuF_{\gamma}) are obtained for 2\,\delta\approx\gamma. As the charge of F is hardly different from -1, the charge of the extra oxygen is equal to -2. In order to explain the difference between the \delta_{\rm opt} and n_{\rm opt} Abakumov _et al._[19] made the speculation that the holes induced by the insertion of oxygen are distributed over the (CuO_{2}) layers and other parts of the Hg-1201 structure, e.g., the HgO_{2} dumb-bell.

The obtained absolute values of the interatomic distances and the range of their variations for increasing \delta are in good agreement with the values published in previous neutron-diffraction studies.

### Pressure dependence of the structural parameters

The variations of the a and c unit-cell parameters and the main interatomic distances in Hg-1201 as the function of pressure are shown in Figs. 4-6. For the optimally doped sample the points corresponding to ambient pressure (measured at D2B) are shown and the line slopes correspond to the compressibilities derived from Ref. [13]. The compressibilities of the unit-cell parameters and the main interatomic distances in Hg-1201, defined as \kappa_{q}= -(1/q)\,\Delta q/\Delta P (10^{-3}/{\rm GPa}), where q is the specific parameter, are presented in Table 4 and in Fig. 7. In order to calculate \Delta q/\Delta P, the linear least-squares fits of the experimental points were used. The fits are shown in Figs. 4-6. For comparison, the compressibilities calculated from the data of Ref. [12], corresponding to the optimally doped Hg -1201 sample, are also presented in Table 4.

The pressure dependence of the Hg-1201 unit-cell parameters show that the occupation of the O(3) position does not

The value of \kappa_{c} in sample A is higher than those in B and C samples. This can be attributed to the comparatively higher compressibility of the Hg-O(2) bond length in the reduced structure of sample A. The compressibility along the c axis in samples B and C is almost fully determined by the \kappa_{\text{Cu-O(2)}}. For all three levels of doping the compressibility anisotropy is quite high, reaching \kappa_{c}/\kappa_{a}\approx 1.47 for sample A. The compressibility becomes less anisotropic when extra oxygen content \delta increases: \kappa_{c}/\kappa_{a} decreases from sample A (1.47\pm 0.02) to C

  (1.36 +- 0.03). This behavior is due to the fact that the Hg-1201 structure becomes more isotropic when the O(3) site occupancy increases.

It is remarkable that the compressibilities of the in-plane Cu-O(1) and Hg-O(3) bonds are practically d independent, while the compressibility of the apical bond distances, Cu-O(2) and Hg-O(2), are strongly dependent upon the doping level. The compressibility of the apical Hg-O(2) bond is close to k_{c} for sample A, but with increasing doping level (samples B and C), it becomes practically incompressible. This was observed in the pressure range up to 5.07 and 2.37 GPa for the optimally and overdoped compositions, respectively.[13] The HgO2 dumb-bell is a very rigid element of the structure. The results presented here show that the length of the Hg-O(2) bond depends on the extra oxygen content in the Hg plane: an increase of the coordination number of the Hg atoms results in an increase of the apical Hg-O(2) bond distance. This bond becomes incompressible with the presence of the significantly large amount of O(3) in the Hg layer. This behavior may seem unusual, however, bond lengths increase when the coordination number of the cation increases and this is exactly what happens to the coordination number of Hg for increasing d. It is possible that some bending of the HgO2 dumb-bell occurs. The departure of the Hg atom from the (0,0,0) position may lead to an apparent shortening of the bond length. Another explanation can be found by analyzing the behavior of the other bond distances in the structure. It is obvious that the compressibility of the Hg-O(2) bond should depend on the compressibilities of the other bonds, such as Cu-O(2) and Ba-O(3) [O(2)], which become more compressible for increasing of the O(3) content.

The compressibility of the apical Cu-O(2) bond length increases when the O(3) content increases despite the shortening of this bond for larger d values. This bond length shortens in these samples proportionally to the decrease of the c axis length, i.e., the pressure dependence of the apical Cu-O(2) bond length for all three types of samples reproduces the pressure dependence of the c unit-cell parameter. The value _k_Cu-O(2) is greater than k_{c} which in part is due to the low value of _k_H2-O(2). If _k_H2-O(2)= 0, then we should have _k_Cu-O(2)= k_{c}(_c_/2_Cu-O(2)), where _I_Cu-O(2) is the length of the Cu-O2 bond.

The compressibilities of the Ba-O distances strongly depend on the doping level. The compressibility of the Ba-O(3) distance becomes larger when the doping level increases. For the A and B samples the compressibility of this distance corresponds approximately to k_{c} , while for the C sample it is almost 2.5 times larger than k_{c} , i.e., for increasing pressure the Ba atom in the overdoped sample is rapidly moving toward the basal plane. The compressibility of the Ba-O(2) bond length becomes also larger for increases of the extra oxygen content. The unexpected result is that the Ba-O(1) distance [between Ba and O of the (CuO2) layers] becomes incompressible in the overdoped state. This distance does not change under pressure, and the compressibility has even a small negative value, while in the underdoped and optimally doped samples this bond decreases for increasing pressure.

Figures 7 and 1 summarize the variations of selected bond compressibilities with the change of the doping level. An increase of the O(3) content results in larger compressibilities of the Ba-O(3) and Cu-O(2) distances, while the Hg-O(2) and Ba-O(1) ones become practically incompressible. Therefore, pressure induces anisotropic effects (which depend on the doping level) on the structure of Hg-1201 compound and, in particular, on the local arrangement of the (CuO2) layers which are responsible for superconductivity. In the overdoped state the separation between these layers and neighboring Ba cations does not decrease under pressure, while the apical O(2) anions shift highly toward the Cu

  cations. In the under- and optimally doped structures pressure causes the shortening of the Ba-O(1) separation and a smaller compression of the Cu-O(2) bond. Such variation of the atomic interactions due to the change of extra oxygen content can be one of the reasons for the enhancement of the charge transfer from the reservoir block to the conducting (CuO2) layers in the overdoped state in comparison with under and optimally-doped superconductors.

One of the most discussed questions in the literature is why T_{c}(P) for the Hg-1201 phases varies differently with the different doping level. This subject is discussed in a few theoretical articles.[70, 11, 18] Even though each is based on various models, all conclude that there are two main reasons the T_{c} change: the increase of T_{c,\max} in Eq. (1) and the variation of the charge-carrier density in the (CuO2) layer due to the charge transfer from the reservoir. From the experimental data on the T_{c} vs P and \delta dependence presented in Ref. [7] it follows that dT_{c}/dP\approx\,const\approx\,2 K/GPa for \delta\approx\,\delta_{\rm opt} at least up to 1.5 GPa pressures. The analysis of Eq. (1) shows that in this case the pressure-induced charge transfer, dn/dP, would have to decrease for increasing \delta, vanishing at \delta = \delta_{\rm opt}. The absolute value of the charge transfer is very small, not higher than 0.002 holes/GPa for the underdoped state.[10, 20] From the homogeneous character of the structure compression revealed in the present study one can conclude that the effect of the charge transfer from the reservoir to the (CuO2) layers does not play the dominant role in the Hg-1201 structure under pressure at \delta\approx\,\delta_{\rm opt}. At the same time, the strong shift of the Ba atoms in the overdoped state toward the (HgO_{\delta}) layer under applied pressure may be considered as the signature of a significant charge transfer into the (CuO2) layer, leading to a stronger overdoping, thus decreasing T_{c}.

## IV Conclusions

In the present article we have presented a neutron-diffraction study of Hg-1201 under high pressure at low and high extra oxygen concentrations in the Hg layer (under- and overdoped states). The results are analyzed together with previous data.[13, 14] The main conclusions are as follows:

The superconductor HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta}, prepared according to the procedure described in Ref. [15] is a cation-stoichiometric compound exhibiting the highest T_{c} at the oxygen concentration in the Hg layer \delta_{\rm opt}=\,0.13\pm 0.01. This oxygen is only situated in the center of the Hg layer. The value of \delta_{\rm opt} was determined by the measurements of seven Hg-1201 at three diffractometers, two of which (D2B and 3T2) are of the classical type with \lambda=\,const, while the third (HRFD) utilizes the time-of-flight technique. All the measured points of the T_{c}(\delta) dependence lie on one curve which strongly indicates that the \delta_{\rm opt} value is realistic.

At low O_{\delta} concentration the Hg-1201 structure compresses uniformly, i.e., the compressibilities of the main interatomic distances correspond to the unit-cell compressibility. However, at higher O_{\delta} concentrations the Hg-O(2) and Ba-O(1) bonds become practically incompressible, while the Cu-O(2) and Ba-O(3) undergo a strong compression. The analysis of the interatomic distances variations allows us to propose that in the under and optimally doped states the charge transfer from the reservoir to the (CuO2) layers plays a minor role. The enhancement of T_{c} under pressure is due to an increase of the T_{c,\max} value. The decrease of T_{c} under applied pressure for the overdoped Hg-1201 superconductor may be explained by charge-transfer enhancing overdoping.
