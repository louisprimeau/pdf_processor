###### Abstract

We report superconductivity in the ternary half-Heusler compound LuPtBi,
with T_(c) = 1.0 K and H_(c2) = 1.6 T. The crystal structure of LuPtBi
lacks inversion symmetry, hence the material is a noncentrosymmetric
superconductor. Magnetotransport data show semimetallic behavior in the
normal state, which is evidence for the importance of spin-orbit
interaction. The combination of strong spin-orbit coupling and
noncentrosymmetric crystal structure make LuPtBi a strong candidate for
3D topological superconductivity.

## I Introduction

Half-Heusler ternary compounds attract increasingly more attention as
new multifunctional materials with spintronic and thermoelectric
applications.[1, 2, 3] Their simple stoichiometric composition,
formulated as XYZ, provides remarkable electronic tunability. Chemical
substitution with different elements from the periodic table tunes the
electronic structure of the final product to semiconducting,[4]
semimetallic,[5] heavy fermion,[6, 7] or superconducting[8, 9] behavior.
Recent theoretical work presents these highly tunable compounds as new
platforms for topological quantum phenomena due to the presence of
strong spin-orbit interactions.[10, 11, 12]

The original theoretical prediction of the 2D topological insulators was
based on the Γ₆/Γ₈ band inversion in the bulk of (Cd,Hg)Te quantum well
due to strong spin-orbit coupling which gives rise to the conducting
surface states.[13, 14] The same theoretical framework is readily
extended to the half-Heusler compounds based on the similarity of their
crystal structure to the zinc-blend structure of the (Cd,Hg)Te
system.[15] Half-Heusler compounds crystallize in the space group
$F\bar{4}3m$ composed of three FCC sublattices placed at X(0,0,0),
Y(1/(4,1/4,1/4), and Z(3/4,3/4) along the cubic diagonal (Fig. 1). The
choice of XYZ elements determines the strength of spin-orbit coupling
which is proportional to the atomic number z. Band structure
calculations[10] have established a linear correlation between the total
atomic number z_(tot) = z_(X) + z_(Y) + z_(Z) in the XYZ composition of
the half-Heuslers and the band inversion amplitude |E_(Γ₈) − E_(Γ₈)|.

A choice of YZ = PtBi in particular favors strong spin orbit coupling
due to the heavy masses of the atomic constituents. Amongst the XPtBi
family, superconductivity is reported in LaPtBi and YPtBi and the
possibility of topological superconductivity is proposed.[8, 9, 16] Lu
is the heaviest lanthanide, hence LuPtBi is the most promising candidate
for 3D topological superconductivity amongst the half-Heusler compounds
due to the maximal strength of spin-orbit coupling. We report the
discovery of superconductivity at T_(c) = 1.0 K in this promising
material.

LuPtBi is interesting for a second reason. Its noncentrosymmetric (NCS)
crystal structure, in which inversion symmetry is violated, implies that
parity is no longer a conserved quantum number and mixed singlet-triplet
pairing is possible.[17] As a result, novel properties may follow, such
as large Pauli-limiting fields and helical vortex states.[18, 19] The
helical vortex state is equivalent to the
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state in centrosymmetric
superconductors, where Cooper pairs have finite center-of-mass momentum
and the order parameter is spatially modulated along the field. The
helical vortex state occurs within Ginzburg-Landau theory by including
strong spin-orbit coupling,[20] a condition pertinent to LuPtBi.

## II Methods

Single crystals of LuPtBi were grown in Bi flux. X-ray diffraction
patterns along the [100] and [111] directions, presented in Fig. 1, show
no evidence of impurity phases. The lattice constant of the cubic
structure a = 6.578 A is consistent with previous reports.[6] Energy
dispersive x-ray spectrometry gives atomic percentages (32.3 : 34.6 :
33.1) ± 3.0

Four-probe resistivity measurements were performed from 300 to 0.3 K in
a Cambridge Magnetic Refrigerator (CMR). The current was applied along
the high-symmetry [100] direction, and the magnetic field in the [010]
direction. The Hall effect was measured by reversing the field and
antisymmetrizing the data at H = ±10 T. AC susceptibility was measured
with the mutual inductance method using a system of four coils and a
lock-in detector. We used a drive field of amplitude 0.03 Oe and
frequency 1 kHz.

## III Results

Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity
in LuPtBi from 300 to 0.3 K. The resistivity gradually decreases from
ρ = 137μΩ cm at room temperature to a residual value ρ₀ = 74μΩ cm at
T → 0. The inset of Fig. 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of the
Hall coefficient R_(H) measured from T = 20 to 2 K. At low temperatures,
it saturates to a large positive value, R_(H)(0) = +256 mm³/C,
corresponding to a hole concentration n_(H) = 1/eR_(H) = 2.44×10¹⁹ cm⁻³,
in a simple one-band model. Our resistivity and Hall data are comparable
to a previous study of LuPtBi which reports ρ₀ = 105μΩ cm and
$R_{\rm H}(0)=+143$ mm³/C hence
$n_{\rm H}=1/eR_{\rm H}=4.3\times 10^{19}$ cm⁻³.[21] This study stops at
T = 2 K hence superconductivity was not revealed. Using the result of
the one-band Drude model σ₀ = ne²τ/m and assuming a spherical Fermi
surface where $k_{\rm F}=(3\pi^{2}n)^{1/3}$, we obtain a large mean free
path l = 1.3μm, confirming high sample quality.

Figure 2(b) shows the field dependence of the resistivity at T = 0.5 K
from H = 0 to 13 T. A strong positive magnetoresistance (MR) is
observed, whereby ρ increases by a factor 5 in 13 T. Our observation of
a large mean free path is consistent with a large orbital MR. Such high
MR values and low carrier concentrations are typical characteristics of
semimetals.[22]

Our use of a one-band Drude model to determine n_(H) and l is clearly
naive, considering that semimetals are typically multiband systems,
nevertheless, we use these simple calculations for a first estimate of
the physical parameters of the material. We use the same model to
calculate similar physical properties of the other two superconducting
members of the half-Heusler series, namely YPtBi and LaPtBi, and compare
them to LuPtBi in Table 1. The three compounds have comparable T_(c)
values and small concentration of carriers, comparable to degenerate
semiconductors.[23]

Figure 3 shows the superconducting transition at T_(c) = 1.0 ± 0.1 K.
The transition is observed as a drop in both electrical resistivity and
magnetic susceptibility, confirming bulk superconductivity in LuPtBi.
The peculiar nonsaturating, linear drop of susceptibility is a common
observation amongst the candidates of topological superconductivity such
as YPtBi and Cu_(x)Bi₂Se₃.[9; 24]

We have determined the upper critical field H_(c2) of LuPtBi by studying
the field dependence of the resistivity at different temperatures.
Figure 4(a) shows resistivity curves as a function of field from T = 0.2
K to 0.8 K. H_(c2)(T) at each temperature is defined as the full
recovery of the normal-state resistivity. Figure 4(b) shows the
temperature dependence of H_(c2)(T) extracted from the data in Fig.
4(a). We evaluate the zero temperature limit of the upper critical field
to be H_(c2)(0) = 1.6 ± 0.1 T by fitting our data to the generalized
Ginzburg-Landau model:

$$H_{c2}(T)=H_{c2}(0)\frac{1-t^{2}}{1+t^{2}},$$

noncentrosymmetric structure, common to all the XYZ half-Heusler family,
belongs to the $F\bar{4}3m$ space group. By taking out the X atom (Lu in
this case), we obtain the zinc-blend structure of the HgTe.

Comparing the coherence length with the mean free path, we find our
sample satisfying the clean limit condition l ≫ ξ₀.

## IV Discussion

According to transport experiments, the XPtBi compounds may be either
semiconducting or semimetallic, depending on the choice of the rare
earth element X.[6] The former is favored by the lighter rare earth
atoms while the latter is favored by the heavier ones. Band structure
calculations show that in the absence of spin-orbit interaction, XPtBi
is a semiconductor. Semimetallic properties appear only when the
spin-orbit interaction is included.[25] Our observations of the weak
temperature dependence of resistivity, the small concentration of
carriers, and the large magnetoresistance in LuPtBi indicate that the
normal state is a semimetal, hence spin-orbit interaction must play a
significant role. A large spin-orbit coupling is also expected from
atomic physics considerations since Lu has the largest atomic number
amongst the lanthanides.

LuPtBi is an unconventional superconductor in two respects. First, it is
a noncentrosymmetric superconductor, because its crystal structure lacks
inversion symmetry. Secondly, superconductivity in the bulk of the
material emerges from a band structure which is likely to be
topologically nontrivial. Below, we discuss both aspects in turn.

### Noncentrosymmetic superconductivity

Superconductivity in a NCS system was first observed in the
heavy-fermion metal CePt₃Si.[26] Soon after, similar f-electron systems
were discovered such as CeIrSi₃ and CeRhSi₃, both superconducting under
pressure.[27, 28] NCS superconductivity has also been discovered in
non-f systems such as Li₂Pd₃B and Li₂Pt₃B.[29, 30]

In the absence of a center of inversion, an asymmetric crystal field
potential creates an electric field Ẽ = −∇Φ which can generate a Rashba
spin-orbit interaction (Ẽ × p⃗) ⋅S̃. This interaction splits the Fermi
surface and introduces a certain helicity to the electrons on each
surface, hence pure spin-singlet or spin-triplet pairings can no longer
be valid descriptions of the pairing state. Mixed singlet-triplet
pairing is one intriguing possibility.[31]

We evaluate H_(c2) = 1.6 T in LuPtBi from a generalized Ginzburg-Landau
analysis [Fig. 4(a)]. Using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg formula in
the clean limit $H_{\rm orb}=0.72T_{c}\left[-dH_{c2}/dT\right]_{T_{c}}$,
we evaluate the orbital limiting field $H_{\rm orb}=1.24$ T. Using
$H_{\rm P}=\Delta/\sqrt{2}\mu_{\rm B}$ and $\Delta=1.76k_{\rm B}T_{c}$,
we evaluate the Pauli limiting field H_(P) = 1.85 T. Since
$H_{\rm orb}<H_{\rm C2}<H_{\rm P}$, superconductivity in LuPtBi is Pauli
limited. The Maki parameter $\alpha=\sqrt{2}H_{\rm orb}/H_{\rm P}$ is
less than one hence the FFLO state is not favorable.[32]

Table 2 summarizes T_(c), H_(c2), $H_{\rm orb}$, and $H_{\rm P}$ for a
number of NCS superconductors, including the heavy fermion systems which
contain free f electrons and the ones with no f electrons. H_(c2) of the
heavy-fermion NCS superconductors clearly exceeds the Pauli limiting
field $H_{\rm P}$, suggestive of triplet pairing. In the non-f NCS
superconductors $H_{c2}<H_{\rm P}$, hence spin triplet pairing is not an
obvious possibility. A recent careful study of YPtBi shows that the
temperature dependence of H_(c2) at different pressures collapses onto a
single universal curve different from the standard curve expected from
spin-singlet superconductors, hence triplet pairing is not entirely
ruled out.[16] Our data shows that similar to YPtBi and

LuPtBi, at different temperatures. A selected number of isotherms are
shown as indicated. H_(c2)(T) is taken as the full recovery of the
normal-state resistivity, as marked by arrows for T = 0.2 K and 0.6 K.
(b) H_(c2) as a function of temperature. The dotted line is a fit to the
Ginzburg-Landau expression [Eq. (1)], which yields H_(c2)(0) = 1.6 T.

resistivity (blue curve, right axis) and the magnetic susceptibility
(red curve, left axis).

the other non-f systems, $H_{c2}<H_{\rm P}$ in LuPtBi. This similarity
between LuPtBi and the non-f systems is not surprising, since the f¹⁴
shell of Lu³⁺ is full and does not contribute to the electric
conduction. The fact that $H_{c2}>H_{\rm P}$ only for heavy-fermion NCS
superconductors raises the question: What is the effect of strong
correlations in determining the magnitude of H_(c2) and the pairing
symmetry in the NCS superconductors? Further theoretical work is needed
to answer that question.

### Topological superconductivity

LuPtBi is the most promising candidate for 3D topological
superconductivity amongst the half-Heusler series due to its maximal
spin-orbit coupling.[10, 15, 33] Strong spin-orbit coupling gives rise
to the band inversion required for topological insulator and semimetal
phases. In this context, LuPtBi provides a topological background for
superconductivity. However, band inversion is not a sufficient condition
for topological superconductivity. It remains for further theoretical
calculations, beyond single band models, to probe the topological nature
of superconducting members of the half-Heusler series. The other two
superconducting compounds in this series, YPtBi and LaPtBi, include
rare-earth ions with much smaller atomic numbers and no f electrons.
Lu³⁺, contrary to the Y³⁺ and La³⁺, has a full f shell and a much larger
z number. Our finding in LuPtBi shows that superconductivity is a common
trend in the half-Heusler systems where f electrons do not contribute to
the conduction band.

The inherent particle-hole symmetry of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes
Hamiltonian allows for a unified classification of topological
superconductors and insulators based on the time reversal and the
particle-hole symmetries.[34, 35] Both topological insulators and
superconductors are characterized by the existence of a bulk gap (band
gap in the former and superconducting gap in the latter) and
topologically protected gapless surface modes. One interesting
possibility is that the nonsaturating linear drop of susceptibility at
T_(c) (Fig. 3) which is commonly observed in all candidates of
topological superconductivity, e.g., Cu_(x)Bi₂Se₃, YPtBi, and LuPtBi is
due to gapless superconductivity on the surface of the material. The in
gap states which are the hallmark of topological superconductors (and
insulators) could steal from the superfluid density and result in this
particular shape of the transition. Recent theoretical works show that
topological superconductivity of class DIII can be realized in NCS
superconductors with time reversal symmetry,[36] a condition pertinent
to LuPtBi. At the surface of a topological superconductor, the
conventional electrons which form the helical edge states in the
topological insulator are replaced by Majorana fermions.[37, 38, 39] One
intriguing possibility is to search for a zero-bias conductance peak on
the surface of LuPtBi via soft point contact spectroscopy, similar to
the experimental observations on Cu_(x)Bi₂Se₃.[40]

## V Conclusion

LDA calculations show that LuPtBi is electronically tuned to a semimetal
state from a parent topological-insulator state[11] and our transport
data reveal semimetallic behavior in LuPtBi. Our finding of
superconductivity in a noncentrosymmetric material that satisfies the
requirements of a topologically nontrivial band structure offers the
exciting possibility of a 3D topological superconductor.
