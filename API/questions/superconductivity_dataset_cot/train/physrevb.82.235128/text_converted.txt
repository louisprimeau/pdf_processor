###### Abstract

We present electronic-structure calculations, electrical resistivity
data, and the first specific-heat measurements in the normal and
superconducting states of quasi-one-dimensional M₂Mo₆Se₆ (M=Tl, In, Rb).
Rb₂Mo₆Se₆ undergoes a metal-insulator transition at ∼170 K:
electronic-structure calculations indicate that this is likely to be
driven by the formation of a dynamical charge-density wave. However,
Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and In₂Mo₆Se₆ remain metallic down to low temperature, with
superconducting transitions at T_(c)=4.2 K and 2.85 K, respectively. The
absence of any metal-insulator transition in these materials is due to a
larger in-plane bandwidth, leading to increased interchain hopping which
suppresses the density wave instability. Electronic heat-capacity data
for the superconducting compounds reveal an exceptionally low density of
states D_(E_(F)) =0.055 states eV⁻¹ atom⁻¹, with BCS fits showing
2Δ/k_(B)T_(c) ≤ 5 for Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and 3.5 for In₂Mo₆Se₆. Modeling the
lattice specific heat with a set of Einstein modes, we obtain the
approximate phonon density of states F(ω). Deconvolving the resistivity
for the two superconductors then yields their electron-phonon transport
coupling function α_(F)²F(ω). In Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and In₂Mo₆Se₆, F(ω) is
dominated by an optical "guest ion" mode at ∼5 meV and a set of acoustic
modes from ∼10 to 30 meV. Rb₂Mo₆Se₆ exhibits a similar spectrum;
however, the optical phonon has a lower intensity and is shifted to ∼8
meV. Electrons in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ couple strongly to both sets of modes,
whereas In₂Mo₆Se₆ only displays significant coupling in the 10-18 meV
range. Although pairing is clearly not mediated by the guest ion phonon,
we believe it has a beneficial effect on superconductivity in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆,
given its extraordinarily large coupling strength and higher T_(c)
compared to In₂Mo₆Se₆.

## I Introduction

The M₂Mo₆Se₆ (M=Tl, In, Rb, Li, Na, K, Cs) system was first discovered
in 1980 (Refs. [1] and [2]) and is closely related to the well-known
quasi-three-dimensional (quasi-3D) Chevrel Phase compounds. Rather than
comprising individual "zero-dimensional" Mo₆X₈ (X=S, Se, Te) octahedral
clusters coupled by a metallic cation, these materials are composed of
quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) (Mo₆Se₆)_(α) chains oriented along the
z axis, weakly coupled by M ions. Only Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and In₂Mo₆Se₆ are
superconducting, with T_(c) =3−6.5 K (varying between samples) and ∼2.9
K, respectively. In contrast, Rb₂Mo₆Se₆ undergoes a broad
metal-insulator transition between 100 and 200 K.[3] Little data
currently exist in the literature for the remaining members of the
family, although it is known that they exhibit similar metal-insulator
transitions and do not become superconducting under ambient pressure at
low temperature.[4, 5]

Reduced dimensionality and its effect on superconductivity remains one
of the central issues in contemporary condensed matter physics research.
Since the late 1970s, numerous unconventional superconductors displaying
highly anisotropic properties in both the normal and superconducting
states have been discovered. Among these, notable examples include the
quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) high-temperature cuprate
superconductors (HTS) and the quasi-1D organic Bechgaard salts. However,
the most strongly 1D superconductors synthesized to date have attracted
remarkably little attention over the years. Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and In₂Mo₆Se₆
boast anisotropy ratios ϵ=H_(c2)^(†)/H_(c2)^(†) ≥ 12.0 and 17.2,
respectively.[6, 7, 8] significantly greater than ϵ=8.5 in
(TMTSF)₂ClO₄.[9] Furthermore, these materials do not possess any
intrinsic magnetism, thus rendering them an ideal uncomplicated system
for the study of low-dimensional superconductivity.

In comparison with the HTS, the number of publications existing for
M₂Mo₆Se₆ is around three orders of magnitude smaller. Early work
concentrated on the electrical transport[7, 10] and magnetic
properties,[11] immediately revealing large anisotropies in both the
normal-state resistivity and superconducting coherence length for
Tl₂Mo₆Se₆. Two distinct classes of Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ were identified[7] by the
behavior of their longitudinal resistivity: A-type samples with
conventional metallic behavior down to low-temperature or B-type samples
displaying a broad minimum for T< ∼ 80 K followed by an upturn
reminiscent of charge-density-wave (CDW) formation. More recent
measurements [6] have shown that the coherence length perpendicular to
the chain axis ξ_(⊥) is at most 75 A, a value not significantly larger
than that found in some HTS. In an important parallel with organic
quasi-1D superconductors, [12] the upper critical field perpendicular to
the chain axis z, H₂^(⊥), does not saturate down to 50 mK. [13] Hall
effect measurements by the same authors display a regime crossover at T≈
80 K which they attribute to the onset of a CDW or spin-density wave
(SDW). However, there is no support for the formation of a CDW in
normal-state resistivity curves for the A-type samples, which
nonetheless display a Hall effect crossover. Furthermore, the weak
temperature-invariant diamagnetism in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ revealed by ac
susceptibility measurements [3] does not encourage a SDW interpretation.

The discovery that the application of uniaxial stress along the z axis
in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ suppresses superconductivity and induces a metal-insulator
transition increased the evidence for this system being close to a CDW
instability, in particular due to the nonlinear I-V curves and broadband
noise characteristic of density wave motion observed. [14] Conversely,
hydrostatic pressure increases the conductivity of Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ in the
normal state but still suppresses superconductivity. [15]

At first glance, the quasi-one-dimensional nature of the M₂Mo₆Se₆ family
renders them strong candidates to undergo a Peierls transition, so it
was initially a mystery as to why Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and In₂Mo₆Se₆ remained
metallic down to low temperature. Early attempts to resolve this
question focused on the calculated band structure [16; 17] which
displayed three contributions to the Fermi surface: a broad singly
degenerate quasi-1D Mo d "helix" band and two doubly degenerate 3D
"octahedral" electron pockets at the zone boundary. The occupancy of
these 3D pockets was believed to stabilize the structure against a
Peierls transition and the authors of all ensuing publications attempted
to interpret their results within this multiband framework. However,
band-structure calculation techniques have significantly advanced since
the nonself-consistent approaches of the early 1980s. It is therefore
instructive to recalculate the band structure of M₂Mo₆Se₆ using a fully
self-consistent method and compare our results with the existing
calculations for Tl₂Mo₆Se₆.

The nature of the superconducting state in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and In₂Mo₆Se₆ also
remains very unclear, particularly since recent scanning tunneling
microscopy experiments [18; 19] on the related quasi-3D Chevrel phase
superconductor PbMo₆Se₈ have provided strong evidence for a highly
anisotropic multiband gap function. Inelastic neutron-scattering
measurements of the phonon density of states (PDoS) (Ref. [20]) revealed
a strong low-energy Einstein-type optical mode attributed to vibrations
of the M "guest" ions between the Mo₆Se₆ chains, as well as higher
energy intrachain modes similar to those seen in the 3D Chevrel phases.
[21] This finding is supported by early normal-state specific-heat data
[22] which unfortunately lacked sufficient resolution to provide any
information on the superconducting state. However, no studies of the
electron-phonon coupling were performed nor have any tunneling
experiments been carried out on the M₂Mo₆Se₆ system.

Motivated by recent discoveries in boride [23; 24] and β-pyrochlore [25]
systems where superconductivity is mediated by a low-energy rattling
phonon, we therefore decided to measure the PDoS and electron-phonon
coupling for Tl₂Mo₆Se₆, In₂Mo₆Se₆, and Rb₂Mo₆Se₆ by deconvolving
normal-state specific-heat and resistivity data. These measurements are
analyzed in parallel with our specific-heat and resistivity data below
T_(c) for M=Tl, In and in the insulating phase for M=Rb. In addition, we
have performed a complete theoretical analysis of the electronic
structure and parameters governing the metal-insulator transition in
M₂Mo₆Se₆. By combining our experimental data with the trends indicated
by our new band structures, we hope to remove some of the confusion
surrounding the mechanism for superconductivity and the effects of low
dimensionality in this fascinating system on the borderline between
superconducting and insulating instabilities.

## II Theory

### Crystal structure

The crystal structure of the compounds with chemical formula M₂Mo₆Se₆ is
shown in Fig. 1, viewed both parallel and perpendicular to the z axis.
Mo and Se atoms form quasi-1D

Figure 1: (Color online) Crystal structure of M₂Mo₆Se₆ compounds in the
001 plane (above) and side view (below) of the (Mo₆Se₆)_(xz) chains.
Darker (lighter) symbols indicate atoms sitting on even (odd) planes,
respectively. The local coordinate system used to plot the partial Mo
and Se characters in Fig. 2 is also shown.

(Mo6Se6)_(x) chains oriented along the z axis, separated by M ions in a
zigzag formation. The chains consist of inner Mo and outer Se triangles,
stacked with a c/2 separation along the z axis and rotated 180^(∘) with
respect to each other. The axes of the Mo-Se triangles are aligned with
each other but rotated by 10^(∘) from the lattice vectors in the x-y
plane. We may consider the chains to be a linear condensation of Mo6S8
clusters via face sharing of the Mo6 octahedra. These clusters are the
building blocks of the related quasi-3D Chevrel phases.

The conventional unit cell is hexagonal (space group PG₃/m), and
contains two formula units; M atoms occupy 2d positions while Mo and Se
atoms occupy 6h positions. The hexagonal lattice parameters (determined
by x-ray diffraction) are a_(H)=8.854, 8.934, 9.257 A and c_(H)=4.493,
4.494, and 4.487 A, respectively, for In, Tl, and Rb-based crystals. It
can immediately be seen that the interchain distance correlates with the
atomic radius of the M atom, whereas c_(H) (and hence the intrachain
atomic separation) remains roughly constant regardless of M.
Furthermore, the intrachain atomic separations are much smaller than the
interchain distances. For example, in Tl the shortest Mo-Mo distance
(for two Mo atoms in the same triangle) is 2.66 A; the shortest Mo-Se
distance is 2.695 A and the Se-Se separation is 3.767 A. In contrast,
the Mo-Mo interchain separation is 6.34 A.

The crystal structure thus provides an immediate indication of the
strong anisotropy present in this family of materials. In the following,
we will show that a large anisotropy is also found in the electronic
structure and discuss its consequences for the physical properties of
M₂Mo6Se6 compounds.

### Electronic structure

We have performed _ab initio_ density-functional theory calculations of
the electronic properties of M₂Mo6Se6 for M=Tl, In, and Rb, employing
the full-potential linear augmented plane-wave method.[26, 27] For all
systems, we used the experimental lattice parameters and optimized the
internal coordinates: these optimized values are given in Table 1.

For Tl2Mo6Se6, where the experimental Wyckoff positions are known,[28]
the optimized coordinates agree with the experimental ones to better
than 1

Since the major features of the electronic structure of M₂Mo6Se6 are the
same for M=Tl, In, and Rb, we will first present the electronic
structure of Tl2Mo6Se6 and then discuss the differences with In and Rb.
Our calculated electronic structure reproduces the main features of the
earlier non-self-consistent calculations,[16, 17] except for one crucial
difference in the position of the Fermi level. The electronic bands and
partial DoSs are shown in Fig. 2, with all energies measured relative to
the Fermi level. Se s and Tl d states form weakly dispersing bands,
located 15 eV and 12 eV below the Fermi level, respectively. The Tl 6s
states lie approximately 7 eV below the Fermi level; Tl is therefore in
a nominal +1 valence state, effectively behaving like an alkali metal.
The bands lying between −5 and +5 eV are mainly of Mo d and Se p
characters, although there is a significant hybridization with Tl p
states as can be seen in Fig. 2. The Mo sp bands are displaced to higher
energies by covalent hybridization with Se p bands and hence lie above
+5 eV.

The 18 Se p bands are centered around −4 eV and overlap with the lower
portion of the 30 Mo d bands, which extend over ±5 eV around the Fermi
level. These are divided into 12 bonding and 16 antibonding states,
separated by a pseudogap ∼1 eV wide around the Fermi level. Two highly
1D bands cross the gap: they derive from the zone folding of a single
helix band. The Fermi level cuts the band structure at k_(z)=π/c,
exactly at half filling. The corresponding Fermi surface is shown in
Fig. 3. In contrast with earlier calculations, we do not find the
additional small 3D pockets at the Fermi level which were previously
alleged to be responsible for the stability of the chains against any
Peierls distortion and ensuing density wave transition.[16] The
octahedron band (of Mo d3z²−r² and x²−y² characters) responsible for
these pockets in fact lies ∼0.1 eV above E_(F). Figure 4 shows that
In2Mo6Se6 and Rb2Mo6Se6 have a very similar band structure to Tl2Mo6Se6,
i.e., there are no other bands at E_(F) except for the helix band. Small
variations in the dispersion of this band must therefore control the
stability of the M₂Mo6Se6 family.

Let us now consider the relative anisotropy of the M₂Mo6Se6 series, in
terms of details of the dispersion of the helix band, using a simplified
tight-binding model with large out-of-plane (W) and small in-plane (w)
bandwidths. In the three rightmost panels of Fig. 2, we highlight the
partial orbital characters which give the largest contribution to the
helix band: the dominant contribution is from Mo d_(zx) states. (The
labels of the orbitals refer to the local coordinate systems centered on
the Mo atoms, shown in Fig. 1.)

In fact, the Bloch states that form this band are built from the
in-phase linear combination of the three equivalent Mo xz orbitals which
sit on each Mo3 triangle. Due to the presence of a twofold screw axis
along the center of the chain, they form right- and left-handed helices
which wind up along the chain axis. (For a definition of the axes, see
Fig. 1.) The out-of-plane bandwidth W is thus given by the hopping of
one Mo d_(zx) to another Mo d_(zx) orbital on the next plane; the
in-plane bandwidth is given by the hopping between the chains, mediated
by Se p_(x) and Tl(In)p_(z) or Rb s orbitals (illustrated by yellow and
green lines, respectively, in Fig. 2).

Due to symmetry, hopping via Tl(In)p_(z) orbitals is more effective than
via Rb s orbitals. In Fig. 4 we show a closeup

  M     x_(Mo)   y_(Mo)   x_(5e)   y_(5e)
  ---- -------- -------- -------- --------
  In    0.189    0.156    0.068    0.369
  Tl    0.187    0.154    0.067    0.366
  Rb    0.181    0.149    0.064    0.355

Se in the three M₂Mo6Se6 compounds considered in this work (M=Tl, In,

of the band structures of M₂Mo₆Se₆, decorated with the partial
characters associated with the M atoms. Here, we observe that the
contribution of Tl and In p_(z) states to the helix band is much
stronger than that of the Rb s states. This agrees well with the
significant In p orbital contribution to the conduction band in
In₂Mo₆Se₆ suggested by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.[29]
Correspondingly, the in-plane bandwidth is reduced by a factor of ∼10 in
Rb₂Mo₆Se₆. From a fit of these three band structures, we extract the
values of W and w reported in Table 2.

### Mechanisms for metal-insulator transitions

The first possibility for the metal-insulator transition is a CDW
instability due to the interaction of the helix band with phonons (i.e.,
a Peierls transition). In M₂Mo₆Se₆, there are two Peierls-type modes
which could lead to dimerization of the chains and open a gap at E_(F):
the eigenvectors are such that the Mo triangular units on subsequent
planes move out of phase with respect to each other and the surrounding
Se triangles can then be displaced either in or out of phase.

Examining these two modes, we use local-density approximations (LDA) to
determine two bare frequencies ω_(0, 1) and ω_(0, 2) which we have found
to be independent of the nature of the M guest ion. Our calculated
values are ω_(0, 1) =22 meV and ω_(0, 2)=27 meV. These frequencies
include the response of the whole electronic band structure to the
phonon perturbations, with the exception of the helix band, which we
calculate analytically below. This procedure is more accurate than a
direct LDA calculation of the phonon frequency, which becomes extremely
inaccurate as the in-plane bandwidth w of the helix band tends to zero.

The effect of both modes on the band structure is the same: a frozen
displacement eu of the atoms along the renormalized eigenvector opens a
gap 2δ=2Du at the Fermi wave vector k_(z)= π/c. This defines the
deformation potential D which [together with the bare phonon frequencies
ω_(0, i) and the DoS at the Fermi level N(0)=1/W] determines the bare
electron phonon coupling constants λ(ω_(0, i)) through the relation,[30]

$$\lambda(\omega_{0,i})=\frac{D^{2}}{WM\omega_{0,i}^{2}}.$$
(1)

Due to the finite in-plane bandwidth of the helix band, a Peierls
transition can take place only if this bare electron-phonon coupling
constant λ(ω_(0, i)) exceeds a critical value λ_(c),

$$\lambda_{c}=\frac{1}{2[\ln(W/w)+1]}.$$
(2)

Figure 3: (Color online) Fermi surface of Tl₂Mo₆Se₆, in a vertical plane
cutting through the center of the hexagonal Brillouin zone, shown in
Fig. 1.

Figure 2: (Color online) Band structure and partial DoSs of Tl₂Mo₆Se₆;
energies are in electron volt and measured with respect to the Fermi
level, DoS are in states/(eV cell). Colors indicate different l
characters (green=s, orange=p, and red=d). Shaded areas, delimited by
dashed lines, refer to the partial characters (Tl p_(z), Mo d_(xz), and
Se p_(x)) which provide the largest contribution at E_(F). For a
definition of the axes and atoms, see Fig. 1. An enlargement of the DoS
around the Fermi level is also shown; the numbers indicate the
enlargement factor.

If λ(ω_(0, i)) < λ_(c), there is no Peierls transition but the bare
phonon frequency is renormalized,

$$\omega_{i} = \omega_{0,1}\sqrt{\left[ 1 - \frac{\lambda(\omega_{0,i})}{\lambda_{c}} \right\rbrack}.$$

If λ(ω_(0, i)) > λ_(c), there is a Peierls transition, with a gap
2δ₀ = 2Dω₀,

$$2\delta_{0} = 2W\exp\left[ - \frac{1}{2\lambda(\omega_{0,i})} \right\rbrack.$$

The frequency of the ith phonon in the off-center position is then given
by

$$\omega_{i} = \omega_{0,i}\sqrt{2\lambda(\omega_{0,i})}.$$

Table II lists the relevant LDA parameters for M = Tl, In, and Rb. It
may readily be seen that all M2Mo5Se6 compounds are close to the CDW
instability since the values of the critical interaction parameters
λ_(c) are very low compared to the bare electron-phonon coupling
parameters λ_(0, i).

For Tl2Mo5Se6 and In2Mo5Se6, the bare electron-phonon coupling constants
for both the lower and the higher Peierls modes are slightly below
λ_(c); for Rb2Mo5Se6 λ(ω_(0, 1)) is well above the critical value, thus
indicating that a Peierls transition is likely to occur with a gap
2δ = 0.34 eV. However, due to the small value of λ(ω_(0, 1)), the
off-center minimum of the phonon potential is very shallow, implying
that the transition is of dynamical rather than static character. This
means that the density wave formation may not be characterized by a
static structural modulation, as is the case for "classical" CDW systems
such as NbSe2.

An alternative explanation for the observed metal-insulator transition
in M2Mo6Se6 compounds could be a SDW instability. A staggered
antiferromagnetic (AFM) order of Mo3 units is the spin analog of the
Peierls distortion. The SDW transition is regulated by the magnetic
coupling constant $\lambda_{J} = \frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{3}W$, where the
Stoner parameter I can be estimated from the atomic value for Mo: 0.6
eV. λ_(J) is one order of magnitude smaller than λ_(c) in Tl, In, and
Rb; we therefore do not find a stable AFM solution by LDA for any of the
M2Mo6Se6 compounds.

However, AFM ordering is also favored by the Coulomb repulsion U, which
is much larger than Hund’s coupling I.

Tl2Mo6Se6 and In2Mo6Se6.

temperature features of the PDoS are accurately reproduced by F̄(ω) but
it does not give a high-precision representation of the PDoS at high
temperature. We model F(ω) as a series of logarithmically spaced
Einstein modes with fixed energies and adjustable weights,

F(ω) = ∑_(k)F_(k)δ(ω − ω_(k)).
(7)

Using this representation, the lattice specific heat is then given by

$$C(T)=3R\sum_{k}F_{k}\frac{x_{k}^{2}e^{\chi_{k}}}{\left(e^{\chi_{k}}-1\right)^{2 }},$$
(8)

where x_(k)= ω_(k)/T and ω_(k + 1)/ω_(k)=1.75 to limit the number of
modes and provide a stable solution. A least-squares fit of the measured
specific heat for each compound was performed and the decomposition into
Einstein modes shown for In₂Mo₆Se₆ as an example in Fig. 9. The fitting
technique for Ti₂Mo₆Se₆ and Rb₂Mo₆Se₆ is identical and the results of a
similarly high quality, accurately reproducing our experimental data
over the entire temperature range.

The fitted PDoS are shown for each compound in Fig. 10 and the results
obtained compare very favorably with previous neutron-scattering
data.[20] All three compounds clearly display the two key features
already identified in the C/T plots: a strong narrow peak below ∼10 meV
and a broader distribution of phonons from ∼10 to 30 meV. The low-energy
peak corresponds to an optical mode–the guest ion phonon–which is
mediated by the M ions vibrating in the tubes formed between the Mo₆Se₆
chains. The broader maximum at higher energy is mainly due to acoustic
intrachain phonons, including the two Peierls modes discussed earlier.

Comparing the PDoS of each compound measured, the two superconductors
are very similar with a slight spectral weight shift to higher energy in
the optical cation mode for In₂Mo₆Se₆. This can be explained by
considering the smaller atomic mass of In compared to Tl. However, the
intensity of the optical mode in Rb₂Mo₆Se₆ is significantly reduced and
its frequency has been shifted to ∼8 meV, compared with

Figure 10: (Color online) Measured phonon density of states for
Tl₂Mo₆Se₆, In₂Mo₆Se₆, and Rb₂Mo₆Se₆ (histograms) plotted simultaneously
with PDoS data from neutron scattering (crosses).

∼4−6 meV in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and In₂Mo₆Se₆. Neutron-scattering data also showed
extensive hybridization of the cation mode with the chain modes in
Rb₂Mo₆Se₆, thus inducing a deformation in the PDoS from 10 to 30 meV
which can also be seen in our data.

### Normal-state resistivity and electron-phonon coupling

The resistivity curves from 0.35 to 300 K for each compound are shown in
Fig. 11. Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and In₂Mo₆Se₆ both show linear metallic behavior in
the normal state. There is no evidence for any negative curvature
resulting from strong correlation effects or the existence of a
Luttinger liquid ground state at high temperature.[36] A saturation in
the resistivity is observed for T<15 K in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and In₂Mo₆Se₆, with
residual resistivity ratios of 10.1 and 8.8, respectively. Conversely,
Rb₂Mo₆Se₆ undergoes a broad metal-insulator transition with a minimum at
T_(c)=170 K and an activation energy E_(A)=173 K.

Using the same phonon frequency bins as those used to calculate the
PDoS, we may now evaluate the electron-phonon coupling from the
normal-state resistivity data for Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and In₂Mo₆Se₆ (it is not
possible to perform this analysis on Rb₂Mo₆Se₆ due to the
metal-insulator transition). This procedure has been successfully used
to obtain the electron-phonon coupling in the superconducting borides
ZrB₁₂,[23] YB₆.[24] and LuB₁₂ (Ref. [37]) as well as the clathrate
superconductors Ba₈Si₄₆ and Ba₂₄Si₁₀₀;[38] a more detailed account of
the method can be found in the references. Our departure point is the
generalized Bloch-Gruneisen formula,[39]

$$\rho_{BG}(T)=\rho(0)+\frac{4\pi m^{*}}{ne^{2}}\int_{0}^{u_{max}}\alpha_{\nu}^ {2}F_{\omega}\frac{xe^{x}}{(e^{x}-1)^{2}d\omega},$$
(9)

where x= ω/T and α_(ν)²F_(ω) is the electron-phonon "transport coupling
function" which can be decomposed into Einstein modes to give

$$\alpha_{\nu}^{2}F_{\omega}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k}\lambda_{\nu,k}\omega_{k} \partial(\omega-\omega_{k}).$$
(10)

Substituting this back into Eq. (9) yields the discrete version of the
Bloch-Gruneisen equation,

$$\rho_{BG}(T)=\rho(0)+\frac{2\pi}{\epsilon_{0}\Omega_{p}^{2}}\sum_{k}\lambda_{ \nu,k}\omega_{k}\frac{x_{k}e^{x_{k}}}{(e^{x_{k}}-1)^{2}},$$
(11)

where the mode weighting parameters are the dimensionless constants
λ_(ν, k). The residual resistivity ρ(0) is determined separately from
the raw data, equaling 39.5 μΩ cm for Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and 37.2 μΩ cm for
In₂Mo₆Se₆.

Our fits are shown in Fig. 12 and display a clear difference between
Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and In₂Mo₆Se₆. The initial slope of (R − R₀)/T is much steeper
in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ due to a large contribution from a mode with energy 59 K.
In contrast, the lowest energy mode contributing to the resistivity in
In₂Mo₆Se₆ is centered at 103 K, with the first significant contribution
only arriving at 180 K. In the absence of any data in the literature for
the carrier density n, we decompose the unscreened plasma frequency
Ω_(p)²=ne²/ϵ₀m^(*) and express our fitted values for α_(ν)²F_(ω)
normalized by ne²/m^(*). These are displayed in Fig. 13), superimposed
on the PDoS.

The principal electron-phonon coupling for each compound occurs in the
10-18 meV frequency window. However, Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ also exhibits a major
coupling in the 3.5-6 meV region, in direct contrast with In₂Mo₆Se₆,
which shows no coupling at all below 6 meV. α_(ν)²F_(ω) is intimately
related to α²F_(ω), the electron-phonon coupling function governing
superconductivity,[40] implying an additional electronic coupling to the
low-energy guest ion phonon in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆.

## IV Discussion

### Superconducting transitions

Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and In₂Mo₆Se₆ both display an anomalous broadening of their
resistive superconducting transitions,

whose amplitude and variation under applied field is not compatible with
conventional 3D thermal fluctuation models. This suggests that the
quasi-1D nature of these compounds has a significant influence on the
size of the critical region around T_(c). In 3D systems, the broadening
of a superconducting transition under applied magnetic field is due to a
finite-size effect:[41] the vortex-vortex separation limits the
divergence of the correlation length at T_(c), hence reducing the
coherence volume and increasing the importance of thermal fluctuations.
In contrast, a perfect 1D system cannot undergo a phase transition due
to insufficient degrees of freedom. Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and In₂Mo₆Se₆ lie in the
crossover regime between these two extremes.

Developing a theoretical model for this transition region is a difficult
task; however, we may consider the Peierls transition as an analogous
crossover from a quasi-1D system to a quasi-3D ordered state. Theory
predicts a suppression of T_(c) by a factor of up to 4, together with a
light smearing of the transition[42] and certain Peierls systems indeed
exhibit significantly broadened "jumps" in their resistivity as a result
of quasi-1D fluctuations.[43] It therefore seems reasonable to attribute
the broadening seen in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and In₂Mo₆Se₆ to the extreme
low-dimensional nature of the compound.

Explaining why the effect is so much more noticeable in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ than
In₂Mo₆Se₆, particularly in the specific-heat jump, is rather harder
especially given that In₂Mo₆Se₆ is more anisotropic. The calculated 3D
Ginzburg number $G_{3\rm{D}}$ for Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ is only 10

The evolution of $G_{1\rm{D}}$ with applied magnetic field has not yet
been calculated for a superconducting nanowire and we were hence unable
to track the broadening of the resistive transition using a
low-dimensional model. However, we expect that a field-induced
finite-size effect similar to that seen in 3D systems should control the
transition widths. The crucial factor here is the difference in
coherence volumes ξ_(⊥)²ξ_(∥) between the two superconductors: 5290 nm³
for Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and 11 400 nm³ for In₂Mo₆Se₆. It is well known that
low-dimensional fluctuations play an increasingly important role upon
the reduction in coherence length in a material; the smaller coherence
volume in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ must therefore outweigh its lower anisotropy
relative to In₂Mo₆Se₆.

It is clear that our understanding of low-dimensional fluctuations at a
superconducting transition would greatly benefit from a detailed
theoretical analysis. In particular, the reproducible deformation of the
specific-heat jump in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ (which presumably results from a
displacement of states from above T_(c) to the back of the jump) is a
remarkable phenomenon and merits further attention. The shape of the
jump is reminiscent of that seen in superconducting carbon nanotube
matrices,[44] suggesting that such behavior may be intrinsic to weakly
coupled superconducting filamentary networks. A
Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition is also thought to occur in
such materials.[45] Within this model, the superconducting transition is
broadened due to the appearance of a phase-incoherent intermediate state
(consisting of Josephson-coupled quasi-1D superconducting fibers)
separating the globally coherent superconducting ground state at low
temperature from the metallic normal state above T_(c). Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and
In₂Mo₆Se₆ would be prime candidates to undergo a similar transition.

We note that despite the strong evidence for quasi-1D fluctuations
around the superconducting transitions in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and In₂Mo₆Se₆ (as
well as the broad resistivity minimum corresponding to the
metal-insulator transition in Rb₂Mo₆Se₆), there is no indication of a
high-temperature Luttinger liquid ground state in bulk M₂Mo₆Se₆.
Transport experiments on Mo₆Se₆ nanowires have revealed Luttinger
behavior in their conductance, which vanishes as the wire diameter
increases above several tens of nanometer.[46] However, since we are
measuring M₂Mo₆Se₆ crystals with diameters of the order of several
hundred microns (and hence an increase in the number of conduction
channels by a factor of 10⁸), the absence of Luttinger effects is to be
expected.

### Electron-phonon coupling

Our BCS s wave fits of the specific heat below T_(c) display
conventional weak coupling (2Δ₀/k_(B)T_(c)=3.5) for In₂Mo₆Se₆ and
extremely strong coupling (2Δ₀/k_(B)T_(c) ≃ 5) for Tl₂Mo₆Se₆. In fact,
Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ may well have usurped the throne of the β-pyrochlore KOs₂O₆
(2Δ₀/k_(B)T_(c) ≃ 5) as the strongest-coupling phonon-mediated
superconductor currently known. It should be noted that abnormally
strong coupling (ranging up to 2Δ₀/k_(B)T_(c) ≃ 25) is a characteristic
of several quasi-1D CDW systems such as NbSe₃ and (TaSe₄)₂I (Refs. [47]
and [48]) due to the transition temperature being suppressed below its
mean-field value. However, given that In₂Mo₆Se₆ is more anisotropic than
Tl₂Mo₆Se₆, we do not believe that the strong coupling in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆
originates from its low dimensionality.

Deconvolving the normal-state resistivity shows that the predominant
common electron-phonon coupling for

Figure 13: (Color online) Phonon density of states (histogram) and
normalized electron-phonon transport coupling function α_(n)²F_(u)
(line) for Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and In₂Mo₆Se₆.

Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and In₂Mo₆Se₆ lies in the 10-18 meV range, implying that
superconductivity is mediated by the intrachain modes which (according
to neutron-diffraction experiments [20]) range from 12 to 40 meV and
peak strongly at 17 meV. This interpretation is supported by a tentative
report of superconductivity under pressure in Mo₆Se₆.[5] The additional
coupling to the low-energy optical mode in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ moves this
superconductor into the extreme strong-coupling regime, increases T_(c)
by nearly 2 K and reduces the coherence volume ξ_(⊥)²ξ_(∥), rendering
the superconducting transition more susceptible to broadening through
quasi-1D fluctuations.

Our observation immediately begs the question why In₂Mo₆Se₆ does not
enjoy a similar coupling to its optical In⁺ mode. There are two reasons
for this: first, consider the variation in the hexagonal lattice
parameter a and the Pauling radii R_(p) of the Tl⁺, In⁺, and Rb⁺
monovalent cations. Values for a measured by x-ray diffraction [1, 49]
in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆, In₂Mo₆Se₆, and Rb₂Mo₆Se₆ are given in Table 4, together
with standard R_(p) values from the literature. Each cation is located
at $a/\sqrt{3}$ from three equidistant Mo₆Se₆ chains and, since the
chain radius is invariant with respect to the cation, the ratio
$\sqrt{3}R_{p}/a$ gives a good measure of the freedom of the respective
cations to vibrate in their interchain tunnels.

It can clearly be seen that the In⁺ ion is less geometrically
constrained than Tl⁺ and that Rb⁺ is at considerably less liberty to
vibrate than either of its "superconducting" counterparts. This is
evident in the neutron-scattering data: as pointed out by Brusetti _et
al._, Rb₂Mo₆Se₆ displays significant hybridization of the low-energy
Einstein phonon, with the higher energy internal chain modes
corresponding to a ∼40

Second, the intrinsic electron-phonon coupling strength λ is
proportional to 1/ω², where ω is the characteristic phonon
frequency.[39] Due to its smaller mass, the In⁺ mode is shifted to
higher energy as can be seen both in our PDoS histograms and the neutron
data from Brusetti in Fig. 10. Using the Tl⁺=5.2 meV and In⁺=6.3 meV
mode energies from Brusetti _et al._,[20] we calculate
$\omega_{\rm ln}^{2}/\omega_{\rm Tl}^{2}$=1.47; i.e., the coupling to
the Tl⁺ mode should be nearly 50

Naively, we might expect an enormous electron-phonon coupling and
ultrastrongly coupled superconductivity in Rb₂Mo₆Se₆ due to its narrow
effective tunnel diameter. However, our electronic-structure
calculations indicate that it is not the geometric constraints on the M
ion in M₂Mo₆Se₆ which determine its anisotropy but rather the degree of
warping in its Fermi sheets. This is controlled by the in-plane
bandwidth w, as detailed in Table 2. The electropositivity of the M
ion–its willingness to donate electrons–is a useful quantity for
characterizing the behavior of M₂Mo₆Se₆ since it is inversely
proportional to w. Group IA metals are much more electropositive than
group III and hence Rb₂Mo₆Se₆ falls victim to a high-temperature
insulating instability rather than becoming superconducting at low
temperature. (It should nevertheless be noted that high-pressure
measurements have succeeded in partially suppressing the metal-insulator
transition in Rb₂Mo₆Se₆ and simultaneously inducing superconductivity
with a maximum T_(c)∼ 4 K.[5]) In a similar fashion, In is more
electropositive than Tl, thus explaining the increased anisotropy seen
in the superconducting state of In₂Mo₆Se₆ compared to that of Tl₂Mo₆Se₆.

### Metal-insulator transitions in M₂Mo₆Se₆

Our LDA calculations have indicated two possible mechanisms for the
metal-insulator transition in M₂Mo₆Se₆: a Peierls transition resulting
in the formation of a dynamical CDW or a SDW driven by strong Coulomb
repulsion. Let us initially consider the SDW scenario.

SDWs and their associated low-temperature antiferromagnetic order are
typically imaged using neutron-scattering techniques. Unfortunately, no
such data exist in the literature for any of the M₂Mo₆Se₆ family.
However, a SDW may also be detected by the temperature dependence of its
magnetic susceptibility χ(T). In a SDW, χ(T) generally exhibits
paramagnetic behavior above the transition but then displays a
characteristic maximum at the critical temperature T_(MI) before
falling, hence signaling the onset of antiferromagnetism. Any SDW
transition should therefore be clearly visible in our ac susceptibility
data (Fig. 5). Examining this closely, no evidence can be seen for any
departure from temperature-invariant weakly diamagnetic behavior above
the noise threshold of our susceptometer (10⁻⁸ emu). In particular, the
ac susceptibility of Rb₂Mo₆Se₆ does not display any anomaly as it passes
through T_(MI). We therefore find no experimental evidence for SDW
formation in M₂Mo₆Se₆.

Note that our calculated magnetic coupling constants λ_(U) are greater
than the critical couplings λ_(c) for all M₂Mo₆Se₆, not just Rb₂Mo₆Se₆.
This implies that any SDW transition should be present in all three
compounds. However, no T_(MI) may be identified in our resistivity data
for Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and In₂Mo₆Se₆. Furthermore, it is not realistic to suggest
that quasi-1D fluctuations suppress SDW formation in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆

and In2Mo6Se6 but not Rb2Mo6Se6: from our electronic-structure
calculations, Rb2Mo6Se6 is much more anisotropic than Tl2Mo6Se6 and
In2Mo6Se6 and should hence be more susceptible to such fluctuations. A
far more probable scenario is that low-dimensional fluctuations prevent
the SDW transition from taking place in all three compounds, with the
metal-insulator transition in Rb2Mo6Se6 driven by a separate mechanism.
Our LDA calculations for the electron-phonon coupling point toward this
being a dynamical CDW and we will continue our discussion from this
perspective.

The transition seen in the electrical resistivity of Rb2Mo6Se6 is very
broad and continuous compared with the distinct steps seen in other CDW
materials such as NbSe3 or TaS2.[43, 50] Such "blurring" can be
explained by a combination of the influence of low-dimensional phase
fluctuations and the dynamical nature of an underlying CDW whose order
parameter may vary in both time and space. Tarascon[3] and Hor[4] have
also performed transport measurements on Rb2Mo6Se6, obtaining similar
broad transitions with _TMI_  125 K, 104 K and E_(A) = 87 K, 145 K,
respectively, which are rather smaller than our values _TMI_  170 K and
E_(A) = 173 K. We attribute the differences between _TMI_ to variations
in sample anisotropy, resulting from slight differences in the
stoichiometries. It is well known that Tl2Mo6Se6 is not a perfectly
stoichiometric compound,[13] with the highest _TMI_ occurring in
Tl1.95Mo6Se6. Similar nonstoichiometric behavior occurs in the rest of
the M2Mo6Se6 family, for example, producing occasional batches of
In2Mo6Se6 which are nonsuperconducting.[10, 49]

No clear evidence has been seen for the metal-insulator transition by
any other experimental technique, although we observe a small anomaly in
the heat capacity of Rb2Mo6Se6 between 170 and 185 K (see Fig. 8), just
above _TMI_. However, the height of the peak scarcely exceeds the noise
threshold of our data and higher resolution measurements will be
required to verify and quantify this feature. Given the limited evidence
for a thermodynamic phase transition at _TMI_, it is tempting to hold
intrachain defects responsible for the insulating behavior observed at
low temperature, relying on thermally activated interchain hopping to
enable metallic conductivity at high temperature. However, this simple
model cannot be applicable to M2Mo6Se6 since it is unable to explain the
broadband conductance noise indicative of sliding density wave
motion.[14] Furthermore, without a phase transition to deplete the DoS
at the Fermi level Rb2Mo6Se6 would become superconducting at low
temperature (unless the defect density is sufficiently high to enable
weak localization). No trace of superconductivity in Rb2Mo6Se6 has been
seen by any experimental technique at ambient pressure.

An examination of the behavioral trends in the remaining (group IA)
members of the M2Mo6Se6 family lends further support to the CDW
argument. Since the electronic anisotropy is proportional to the
electropositivity of the M atom, we would expect to see metal-insulator
transition temperatures fall as we move up group IA (i.e., Cs   Na).
Although no systematic study of the family has been carried out by a
single author, Tarascon _et al.[3]_ found that Cs2Mo6Se6 has a higher
_TMI_ than Rb2Mo6Se6, which is in line with this hypothesis. Hor _et
al.[4]_ have shown that hydrostatic pressure (leading to an enhanced
interchain coupling and reduced anisotropy) suppresses _TMI_ to lower
temperatures, implying that _TMI_ simply scales with the area of the
Fermi surface available for nesting (as would be expected for a CDW).
Nevertheless, a comprehensive study of all group IA members of the
M2Mo6Se6 family will clearly be required to validate our proposed
dynamical CDW scenario. It is interesting to note that scanning
tunneling spectroscopy (STS) on small bundles of Mo6Se6 chains has
revealed metallic behavior down to 5 K.[51] however the reduced
electronic filling in Mo6Se6 results in a different electronic structure
at the Fermi level with up to three bands occupied.[52] A simple density
wave model is hence unlikely to be applicable in this compound.

In addition to the obvious metal-insulator transition in Rb2Mo6Se6, it
is important to address the possibility of superconductivity in
Tl2Mo6Se6 arising from a hidden CDW ground state, as suggested by the
Hall effect results from Brusetti _et al.[13]_ Our results confirm that
there is no discontinuity in the resistivity or jump in the specific
heat of either Tl2Mo6Se6 or In2Mo6Se6 to support this conjecture. Local
stoichiometric heterogeneity in the samples measured could produce a
continuous series of local transitions, further blurred by quasi-1D
fluctuations. However, this would produce a positive curvature in _P(T)_
for T < 80 K, which is not seen. Alternatively, if we assume that the
interchain coupling in Tl2Mo6Se6 is sufficiently strong for such
low-dimensional fluctuations to be negligible, a theoretical model[53]
may be invoked which defines two separate transition temperatures: T_(x)
at which the CDW distortion occurs and T_(l) at which an energy gap
opens over the entire Fermi surface and a metal-insulator transition
occurs. Despite the presence of a structural modulation, metallic
behavior persists in the intermediate temperature range T_(l) < T <
T_(x) whose width is acutely dependent on the anisotropy. Using this
model and the Brusetti Hall coefficient data, we could identify T   80 K
as T_(x) in Tl2Mo6Se6 and assume that the superconducting transition
takes place at T_(c) > T_(l). However, we cannot justify disregarding
quasi-1D fluctuations (as required by the model) when they are
manifested so clearly in the deformation of the specific-heat jump below
T_(c) in Tl2Mo6Se6.

A more attractive explanation envisages a partial CDW gradually
depleting the Fermi surface in Tl2Mo6Se6 as the temperature decreases.
This model agrees perfectly with the observed crossover from
electronlike to holelike carriers, yet a corresponding increase in
carrier mobility below 80 K is still required to explain the linear
metallic resistivity. It is not clear what type of physical mechanism
could be responsible for such a rise in mobility and hence the reported
Hall coefficient data in Tl2Mo6Se6 remains mysterious. In contrast, the
situation in Rb2Mo6Se6 is less complex: the observed transition to
insulating behavior implies that a gap opens across the entire Fermi
surface. However, with the present data set it is unfortunately
impossible to judge whether a similar "partial CDW" might be present for
T > 170 K in this material.

Recent work[54] on (TaSe4)2I has suggested the existence of so-called
unconventional CDWs (UCDWs) in quasi-1D systems, with a _k_-dependent
gap which averages to zero at the Fermi surface. This results in the
formation of a pseudogap prior to a density wave transition and is
supported by photoemission data in K_(0.3)MoO₃ and (TaSe₄)₂[15].[56]
Within the pseudogap phase, the UCDW competes with low-dimensional
quantum fluctuations as described by the Lee-Rice-Anderson model:[42]
these act to suppress the Peierls transition temperature T_(P) well
below its mean-field value T_(MF), with the CDW energy gap (the order
parameter) fluctuating in time and space between these temperatures. It
seems likely that M₂MoO₆Se₆ displays a nontrivial combination of
low-dimensional fluctuation effects and a dynamical CDW with possible
momentum dependence. STS or angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) would be ideal tools to verify the existence of an UCDW,
fluctuating order parameter or dynamical CDW since although a pseudogap
should open in the density of states, no static modulation of the
structure or charge density is expected.

## V Conclusions

We have calculated the electronic structures and studied the resistivity
and specific heat in both superconducting and normal states for the
quasi-1D M₂Mo₆Se₆ family of cluster condensates (M = Tl, In,Rb). These
materials lie on the border between superconducting and insulating
instabilities.

Superconductivity in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and In₂Mo₆Se₆ is principally mediated by
an internal phonon from the Mo₆Se₆ chains with an energy in the 12-18
meV range. It is hoped that theoretical calculations will soon identify
the precise energy and nature of this phonon. Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ exhibits a
further coupling to an optical mode at ∼5 meV, which we identify with
interchain vibrations of the Tl⁺ ion. This extra coupling is not present
in In₂Mo₆Se₆ due to the higher In⁺ phonon energy and the reduced
geometrical constraints on the In⁺ ion between the Mo₆Se₆ chains. The
low-temperature specific heat of In₂Mo₆Se₆ is well fitted by a standard
single-gap isotropic s-wave BCS model with 2Δ₀/k_(B)T_(c) = 3.5 ± 0.1.
However, the additional interaction with the low-energy mode in
Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ pushes it into the strong-coupling regime with 2Δ₀/k_(B)T_(c)
≡ 5. The specific-heat jump at T_(c) also exhibits a significant
deformation with a shift in states to low temperature, which we
attribute to strong low-dimensional fluctuations accentuated by the
small coherence volume. STS or similar tunneling experiments would
provide conclusive proof of the gap symmetry, as well as displaying the
coupling to the low-energy phonon.

Our LDA calculations show that in all members of the M₂Mo₆Se₆ family, a
single 1D helix band crosses the Fermi level. Its in-plane dispersion w
is reduced by a factor of 10 in Rb₂Mo₆Se₆ compared with Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ and
In₂Mo₆Se₆ while the out-of-plane dispersion is practically unchanged.
Using an analytical model, we have shown that this reduction in w is
sufficient to explain the trend from metallic conductivity followed by
strongly coupled superconductivity in Tl₂Mo₆Se₆ to a high-temperature
metal-insulator transition in Rb₂Mo₆Se₆. This insulating ground state is
a consequence of either a dynamical Peierls (CDW) instability or a SDW
transition driven by strong electronic correlations. The
temperature-invariant magnetic susceptibility seen in all three
compounds favors a CDW interpretation. M₂Mo₆Se₆ are therefore an ideal
target for future ARPES experiments since a dynamical CDW should
generate a pseudogap at the Fermi level.
