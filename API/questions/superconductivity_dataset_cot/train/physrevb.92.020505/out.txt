###### Abstract

The introduction of impurities in superconducting materials is a well known approach to test their stability for future technological applications as well as to unravel their intrinsic microscopic properties. In the cuprates the study of the staggered spin configuration around isolated spinless impurities, as Zn, has allowed one to determine how the electronic correlations evolve throughout the phase diagram [1]. When a sizable amount of impurities is introduced they can no longer be treated as independent local perturbations; the correlation among the impurities themselves has to be considered and quantum transitions to new phases may arise [2].

In iron-based superconductors several studies on the effect of impurities have been carried out and it has soon emerged that the behavior may vary a lot depending on the family considered. If one concentrates on the LnFeAsO_{1-x}F_{z} (Ln1111) family, with Ln a lanthanide ion, one notices that spinless impurities introduced by substituting Fe by Ru, cause a very weak effect both on the magnetic (z=0) [3, 4, 5, 6] and on the superconducting (z=0.11) [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] ground state. One has to introduce almost 60% of Ru to quench either one of the two phases. On the other hand, if one considers the effect of paramagnetic impurities such as Mn [12] a much stronger effect is observed. In fact, in optimally doped (z\simeq 0.11) Sm1111 the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} vanishes for a Mn content around 8% (see Fig. 1). Remarkably in optimally electron-doped LaFe_{1-x}Mn_{x}AsO_{0.89}F_{0.11} superconductors T_{c} drops to zero for x as low as 0.2% [13], more than an order of magnitude less than for Sm1111, and a quantum phase transition to a magnetic ground state is observed [14]. The different behavior of Sm1111 and La111 against Mn impurities shows that by decreasing the lanthanide ion size T_{c} decreases more slowly with x and the system is driven away from a quantum critical point (QCP).

The nature of the magnetic ground state development at high Mn contents is still controversial [15]. In Ba_{0.5}K_{0.5}(Fe_{1-x}Mn_{x}As)_{2} superconductors neutron scattering results suggested that Mn could modify the magnetic wave vector from (\pi/a,0) to (\pi/a,\pi/a) (square lattice unit cell with Fe ions at the vertices) [16], leading to a weakening of s_{x^{-}}wave pairing [17]. However, the absence of single crystals with a size appropriate for neutron scattering experiments makes the determination of the magnetic correlations developing upon Mn doping rather difficult for Ln1111 superconductors.

Since in Fe-based superconductors one of the most likely pairing mechanisms involves magnetic excitations [18], it is of major importance to investigate how the spin excitations evolve in optimally doped LaFe_{1-x}Mn_{x}AsO_{0.89}F_{0.11} superconductors as the QCP is approached. From ^{75}As nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T_{1} measurements it was observed [14] that when T_{c} vanishes for x_{c}\simeq 0.002 the spin correlations follow the behavior predicted for strongly correlated electron systems close to a two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic QCP [19]. In this Rapid Communication it is shown that upon increasing the chemical pressure, by partially substituting Y for La, T_{c} decreases more slowly with x (Fig. 1), mimicking the effect observed for Sm1111. This indicates that the different behavior of Sm1111 and La1111 against Mn impurities has to be associated with the larger chemical pressure induced by the lanthanide ions on the FeAs planes in the former case. From ^{19}F NMR 1/T_{1} measurements it is shown that besides the high frequency (10^{12}-10^{13} s^{-1}) dynamics probed by ^{75}As nuclei, an additional very low-frequency (megahertz range) dynamics develops upon Mn doping and becomes progressively enhanced as the QCP is approached. Furthermore, it is evidenced that if the system is driven away from the QCP by partially substituting La with Y the low-frequency dynamics becomes significantly enhanced only at high Mn contents where T_{c}\to 0. These results evidence that the disruption of the superconducting phase coincides with the enhancement of low-frequency fluctuations possibly competing with the ones driving the pairing.

NMR experiments were performed on (La,Y) Fe_{1-x}Mn_{x}AsO_{0.89}F_{0.11} polycrystalline samples. Y for La substitution allows one to vary the chemical pressure without introducing paramagnetic lanthanide ions which would significantly affect ^{19}F NMR 1/T_{1}[20]. Two series of samples were studied: the first one with no Y and with Mn contents of x=0\%, 0.025\%, 0.075\%, 0.1\%, and 0.2\% (referred to as LaYO), while the second one was studied with 20\% of yttrium (LaY20 hereafter) and Mn content x=0\%, 0.3\%, 0.5\%, 10\%, and 20\%. LaY0 and LaY20 samples were prepared as described in Refs. [13] and [21], respectively. All the samples were optimally electron doped with fluorine content around 11\%[22]. T_{c} was determined by means of superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) zero-field-cooled magnetization measurements in a 10 Oe magnetic field [21]. The diagram of the superconducting phase, for both series of samples, as a function of Mn content is shown in Fig. 1. It is evident that the introduction of 20\% of yttrium stabilizes the superconducting phase, leading to an increase of T_{c} for x=0[23] as well as to a marked increase of x_{c} from 0.2\% to about 4.5\%.

^{19}F NMR measurements were performed at low magnetic fields, H\leqslant 1.5 T, by using standard radio-frequency pulse sequences. The spin-lattice relaxation rate was estimated by following the recovery of nuclear magnetization M_{z}(\tau) after a saturation recovery sequence. The recovery was fit according to

\[M_{z}(\tau)=M_{0}[1-f\,e^{-(\tau/T_{1})t^{\prime}}]\] (1)

with M_{0} the magnetization at equilibrium. The factor f\simeq 1 is introduced to account for incomplete saturation and \theta is a stretching exponent which indicates a distribution of 1/T_{1}. The stretching exponent \beta was found to be 1 for T>80 K and decreased to about 0.5 at low T. The distribution of relaxation rates originates from the presence of different inequivalent Mn impurity configurations around ^{19}F nuclei.

The T dependence of 1/T_{1} for both sample series is shown in Fig. 2. Below 70 K ^{19}F NMR 1/T_{1} is characterized by a progressive increase upon decreasing T, by a pronounced maximum around 20 K, which can be either below or above T_{c} depending on the Y and Mn content (see Fig. 1) and eventually by a decrease at low T. Since, in all samples, the increase starts well above T_{c} those peaks should not be associated with dynamics which develop in the superconducting phase (e.g., vortex motions) [24] but to normal state low-energy excitations. It should be remarked that in the normal phase of Ln111 superconductors without impurities no marked peak in 1/T_{1} has ever been reported. Only peaks in 1/T_{1}T have been observed [25], corresponding to small bumps in 1/T_{1}. Here it

In the inset the temperature (T) dependence is reported also for x=10\% and x=20\% nonsuperconducting samples. The dashed lines are fits of the data according to Eq. (3) in the text, while the arrows indicate the T_{c} of the different samples (decreasing with increasing x).

  is noticed that those peaks are significantly enhanced by the presence of impurities suggesting that Mn tends to strengthen those low-frequency dynamics which might already be present in pure compounds (see Fig. 2).

By performing 1/T_{1} measurements at different magnetic fields one observes that while the high T behavior is only weakly field dependent the magnitude of the peak around 20 K grows by lowering the magnetic field (Fig. 3). This is exactly the behavior expected in the presence of dynamics approaching the nuclear Larmor frequency \omega_{0}, namely, in the megahertz range. If one assumes an exponential decay for the correlation function describing the fluctuations with a characteristic time \tau_{c}, then one has [26]

\[\frac{1}{T_{1}}=\gamma^{2}\langle h_{\perp}^{2}\rangle\frac{\tau_{c}}{1+\omega _{0}^{2}\tau_{c}^{2}},\] (2)

where \gamma is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio and \langle h_{\perp}^{2}\rangle the mean square amplitude of the local field fluctuations perpendicular to \hat{H}. In several disordered systems, including cuprates [27], the T dependence of the correlation time is well accounted for by an Arrhenius law \tau_{c}(T)=\tau_{0}\exp(E_{a}/k_{B}T) with E_{a} an energy barrier and \tau_{0} the characteristic attempt time. Nevertheless, a monodisperse behavior cannot suitably describe the broad peaks in 1/T_{1} and one rather has to consider a distribution of correlation times associated with the nonuniform distribution of Mn impurities. This corresponds to a distribution of energy barriers which, for simplicity, was taken as squared with a width \Delta centered around \langle E_{a}\rangle[28]. In order to account for the high T behavior of 1/T_{1} a linear Korringa term \sigma[29], characteristic of metallic systems, was introduced (see Fig. 2). Then 1/T_{1} can be described by the expression [28]

\[\frac{1}{T_{1}} = \frac{\gamma^{2}\langle h_{\perp}^{2}\rangle T}{2\omega_{0}\Delta} \big{[}a\tan\big{(}\omega_{0}\tau_{0}e^{\langle E_{a}\rangle+\Delta\rangle/T} \big{)}\] (3) \[-a\tan\big{(}\omega_{0}\tau_{0}e^{\langle E_{a}\rangle-\Delta \rangle/T}\big{)}\big{]}+\alpha T.\]

By fitting the data of the superconducting samples (x<0.2% for LaVO and x\leqslant 0.5% for LaY20) one notices that for LaY20 spin correlations yield a significant increase in the width of the distribution on approaching the crossover between the superconducting and magnetic phases (Fig. 4). On the other hand, for the LaY20, within the uncertainty of the fit parameters, there is no evidence for a net increase of \Delta in the same doping range (Fig. 4). In other terms, in the LaY20 family the dynamics does not vary significantly upon increasing the Mn content up to x=0.5%, suggesting that the collective coupling is still weak.

Moreover, one may notice (Fig. 2) that for x\leqslant 0.5%, in the LaVO series the peak in 1/T_{1} grows significantly with Mn doping, while in the LaY20 series it remains practically unchanged. This evidences that 1/T_{1} increases progressively as T_{c}\to 0, namely, the strength of the local spin susceptibility in the FeAs plane becomes enhanced due to the proximity to the QCP. In other terms, for similar Mn contents the spin correlations get weaker as the chemical pressure is increased by Y doping. Further support in this respect is provided by the T dependence of ^{19}F NMR linewidth \Delta v which is directly related to the amplitude of the staggered magnetization developing around the impurity [12]. As shown in Fig. 5 for similar Mn doping ^{19}F NMR linewidth is unambiguously larger in the sample without Y. The data in Fig. 5 can be fitted with a Curie-Weiss law \Delta v=(\Delta v)_{0}+C/(T+\Theta). (\Delta v)_{0}\simeq 13 kHz is the T-independent linewidth due to nuclear dipole-dipole interaction which is assumed similar for both samples, since it is determined by nuclear dipolar coupling which remains practically unchanged (the F content and the lattice parameters do not vary significantly between the two samples [30]). This value is quite close to 14 kHz, the one estimated from dipolar lattice sums [31]. The fit of the data shows that C increases by a factor of 3 and that \Theta increases from about 3 K to 11 K between the x=0.3% LaY20 and x=0.2% LaY0 samples.

The observation that the magnetic correlations become depressed when La is substituted by a smaller lanthanide ion can in principle be associated with a decrease of the ratio U/t between Coulomb repulsion and hopping integral due to the increase in the chemical pressure. However, for stripe collinear order [\tilde{Q}=(\pi/a,0) or (0,\pi/a)] theoretical works [32,33]

  suggest that in Ln1111 the magnetic order parameter should become enhanced on decreasing the Ln size or equivalently increasing the As z/c coordinate, exactly the opposite of what is found here. It should also be remarked that the behavior found upon Mn doping is contrary to that observed in Ru-substituted Fe-based superconductors where the magnetic order is stabilized by decreasing the size of the lanthanide [11]. Hence, it is likely that upon increasing x magnetic correlations different from the stripe ones develop. Giovannetti _et al._[33] showed, through Landau free energy calculations, that around optimal electron doping the energy difference between the stripe and orthomagnetic phases becomes reduced. Hence, it might be possible that the introduction of Mn impurities could stabilize the latter type of order.

More recently Gastiasoro and Andersen [34] have considered the cooperative behavior of paramagnetic impurities coupled via Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction in the Fe-based superconductors. They pointed out that upon increasing the Kondo-like coupling between the localized impurity and the itinerant electrons, Neel [\tilde{Q}=(\pi/a,\pi/a)] correlations would arise and the amplitude of collinear stripe modes decrease. However, even when the coupling becomes significant and Neel fluctuations enhanced, stripe spin correlations would still survive. In a real space description their results imply the development of Neel-type correlations in small islands around the impurity and stripe spin arrangement at larger distances from the impurity. Even if from ^{19}F NMR spectra we cannot check the validity of this model, this theoretical approach is able to explain both the weakening of the superconductivity [17] and the onset of a novel magnetic phase upon Mn doping [14]. In such a scenario the peaks in 1/T_{1} should be associated with the freezing of the spin fluctuations around Mn impurities which get more and more correlated as the QCP is approached. The theoretical model by Gastiasoro and Andersen [34] also allows one to make an analogy between heavy fermion physics and that achieved by doping Fe-based superconductor impurities. In this respect we recall that, similarly to heavy fermions, at the QCP there is a charge localization [13] suggesting a divergence of the electron effective mass. Hence, one should actually consider two possible concomitant effects which depress superconductivity: loss of spin excitations causing the pairing and/or charge localization. Once more, we remark that the behavior achieved by Mn doping is quite different from that observed in Ln1111 superconductors doped with Ru spinless impurities, where even at very high doping levels (\simeq50%) the system remains metallic [35].

An alternative explanation for the growth of low-frequency spin fluctuations in Mn-doped Ln1111 relies on the presence of nematic fluctuations. In this respect it is interesting to observe that even nominally pure samples do show a small bump in 1/T_{1}[25,36,37] in the same T range where the peak in ^{19}F NMR 1/T_{1} arises. The same low-frequency dynamics was found to affect the NMR transverse relaxation rate in Ba(Fe_{1-x}Rh_{x})_{2}As_{2} and was tentatively associated with nematic fluctuations [37], possibly involving charge stripes [36]. Although there is no neat evidence for the type of dynamics here, one may be tempted to relate the energy barrier probed by 1/T_{1} to the one separating the degenerate nematic phases [38]. In this framework the enhancement of the low-frequency dynamics could be associated with the pinning of those fluctuations by impurities.

In conclusion, the increase in the chemical pressure driven by Y for La substitution in La_{1-y}Y_{y}Fe_{1+x}Mn_{x}AsO_{0.89}F_{0.11} is found to lead to a less effective suppression of the superconducting ground state by Mn doping. ^{19}F NMR 1/T_{1} measurements exhibit a low-T peak which indicates the onset of very low-frequency dynamics with an amplitude directly related to the proximity of the compound to the QCP between superconducting and magnetic phases. Based on recent theoretical works, this behavior could be ascribed to the enhancement of spin correlations different from stripe ones, suggesting that T_{c} is depressed by the decrease in the spin fluctuations around (\pi/a,0), which are widely believed to mediate the pairing, or by the localization effect in the region close to the metal-insulator boundary.

###### Abstract

The introduction of impurities in superconducting materials is a well known approach to test their stability for future technological applications as well as to unravel their intrinsic microscopic properties. In the cuprates the study of the staggered spin configuration around isolated spinless impurities, as Zn, has allowed one to determine how the electronic correlations evolve throughout the phase diagram [1]. When a sizable amount of impurities is introduced they can no longer be treated as independent local perturbations; the correlation among the impurities themselves has to be considered and quantum transitions to new phases may arise [2].

In iron-based superconductors several studies on the effect of impurities have been carried out and it has soon emerged that the behavior may vary a lot depending on the family considered. If one concentrates on the LnFeAsO_{1-x}F_{z} (Ln1111) family, with Ln a lanthanide ion, one notices that spinless impurities introduced by substituting Fe by Ru, cause a very weak effect both on the magnetic (z=0) [3, 4, 5, 6] and on the superconducting (z=0.11) [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] ground state. One has to introduce almost 60% of Ru to quench either one of the two phases. On the other hand, if one considers the effect of paramagnetic impurities such as Mn [12] a much stronger effect is observed. In fact, in optimally doped (z\simeq 0.11) Sm1111 the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} vanishes for a Mn content around 8% (see Fig. 1). Remarkably in optimally electron-doped LaFe_{1-x}Mn_{x}AsO_{0.89}F_{0.11} superconductors T_{c} drops to zero for x as low as 0.2% [13], more than an order of magnitude less than for Sm1111, and a quantum phase transition to a magnetic ground state is observed [14]. The different behavior of Sm1111 and La111 against Mn impurities shows that by decreasing the lanthanide ion size T_{c} decreases more slowly with x and the system is driven away from a quantum critical point (QCP).

The nature of the magnetic ground state development at high Mn contents is still controversial [15]. In Ba_{0.5}K_{0.5}(Fe_{1-x}Mn_{x}As)_{2} superconductors neutron scattering results suggested that Mn could modify the magnetic wave vector from (\pi/a,0) to (\pi/a,\pi/a) (square lattice unit cell with Fe ions at the vertices) [16], leading to a weakening of s_{x^{-}}wave pairing [17]. However, the absence of single crystals with a size appropriate for neutron scattering experiments makes the determination of the magnetic correlations developing upon Mn doping rather difficult for Ln1111 superconductors.

Since in Fe-based superconductors one of the most likely pairing mechanisms involves magnetic excitations [18], it is of major importance to investigate how the spin excitations evolve in optimally doped LaFe_{1-x}Mn_{x}AsO_{0.89}F_{0.11} superconductors as the QCP is approached. From ^{75}As nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T_{1} measurements it was observed [14] that when T_{c} vanishes for x_{c}\simeq 0.002 the spin correlations follow the behavior predicted for strongly correlated electron systems close to a two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic QCP [19]. In this Rapid Communication it is shown that upon increasing the chemical pressure, by partially substituting Y for La, T_{c} decreases more slowly with x (Fig. 1), mimicking the effect observed for Sm1111. This indicates that the different behavior of Sm1111 and La1111 against Mn impurities has to be associated with the larger chemical pressure induced by the lanthanide ions on the FeAs planes in the former case. From ^{19}F NMR 1/T_{1} measurements it is shown that besides the high frequency (10^{12}-10^{13} s^{-1}) dynamics probed by ^{75}As nuclei, an additional very low-frequency (megahertz range) dynamics develops upon Mn doping and becomes progressively enhanced as the QCP is approached. Furthermore, it is evidenced that if the system is driven away from the QCP by partially substituting La with Y the low-frequency dynamics becomes significantly enhanced only at high Mn contents where T_{c}\to 0. These results evidence that the disruption of the superconducting phase coincides with the enhancement of low-frequency fluctuations possibly competing with the ones driving the pairing.

NMR experiments were performed on (La,Y) Fe_{1-x}Mn_{x}AsO_{0.89}F_{0.11} polycrystalline samples. Y for La substitution allows one to vary the chemical pressure without introducing paramagnetic lanthanide ions which would significantly affect ^{19}F NMR 1/T_{1}[20]. Two series of samples were studied: the first one with no Y and with Mn contents of x=0\%, 0.025\%, 0.075\%, 0.1\%, and 0.2\% (referred to as LaYO), while the second one was studied with 20\% of yttrium (LaY20 hereafter) and Mn content x=0\%, 0.3\%, 0.5\%, 10\%, and 20\%. LaY0 and LaY20 samples were prepared as described in Refs. [13] and [21], respectively. All the samples were optimally electron doped with fluorine content around 11\%[22]. T_{c} was determined by means of superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) zero-field-cooled magnetization measurements in a 10 Oe magnetic field [21]. The diagram of the superconducting phase, for both series of samples, as a function of Mn content is shown in Fig. 1. It is evident that the introduction of 20\% of yttrium stabilizes the superconducting phase, leading to an increase of T_{c} for x=0[23] as well as to a marked increase of x_{c} from 0.2\% to about 4.5\%.

^{19}F NMR measurements were performed at low magnetic fields, H\leqslant 1.5 T, by using standard radio-frequency pulse sequences. The spin-lattice relaxation rate was estimated by following the recovery of nuclear magnetization M_{z}(\tau) after a saturation recovery sequence. The recovery was fit according to

\[M_{z}(\tau)=M_{0}[1-f\,e^{-(\tau/T_{1})t^{\prime}}]\] (1)

with M_{0} the magnetization at equilibrium. The factor f\simeq 1 is introduced to account for incomplete saturation and \theta is a stretching exponent which indicates a distribution of 1/T_{1}. The stretching exponent \beta was found to be 1 for T>80 K and decreased to about 0.5 at low T. The distribution of relaxation rates originates from the presence of different inequivalent Mn impurity configurations around ^{19}F nuclei.

The T dependence of 1/T_{1} for both sample series is shown in Fig. 2. Below 70 K ^{19}F NMR 1/T_{1} is characterized by a progressive increase upon decreasing T, by a pronounced maximum around 20 K, which can be either below or above T_{c} depending on the Y and Mn content (see Fig. 1) and eventually by a decrease at low T. Since, in all samples, the increase starts well above T_{c} those peaks should not be associated with dynamics which develop in the superconducting phase (e.g., vortex motions) [24] but to normal state low-energy excitations. It should be remarked that in the normal phase of Ln111 superconductors without impurities no marked peak in 1/T_{1} has ever been reported. Only peaks in 1/T_{1}T have been observed [25], corresponding to small bumps in 1/T_{1}. Here it

In the inset the temperature (T) dependence is reported also for x=10\% and x=20\% nonsuperconducting samples. The dashed lines are fits of the data according to Eq. (3) in the text, while the arrows indicate the T_{c} of the different samples (decreasing with increasing x).

  is noticed that those peaks are significantly enhanced by the presence of impurities suggesting that Mn tends to strengthen those low-frequency dynamics which might already be present in pure compounds (see Fig. 2).

By performing 1/T_{1} measurements at different magnetic fields one observes that while the high T behavior is only weakly field dependent the magnitude of the peak around 20 K grows by lowering the magnetic field (Fig. 3). This is exactly the behavior expected in the presence of dynamics approaching the nuclear Larmor frequency \omega_{0}, namely, in the megahertz range. If one assumes an exponential decay for the correlation function describing the fluctuations with a characteristic time \tau_{c}, then one has [26]

\[\frac{1}{T_{1}}=\gamma^{2}\langle h_{\perp}^{2}\rangle\frac{\tau_{c}}{1+\omega _{0}^{2}\tau_{c}^{2}},\] (2)

where \gamma is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio and \langle h_{\perp}^{2}\rangle the mean square amplitude of the local field fluctuations perpendicular to \hat{H}. In several disordered systems, including cuprates [27], the T dependence of the correlation time is well accounted for by an Arrhenius law \tau_{c}(T)=\tau_{0}\exp(E_{a}/k_{B}T) with E_{a} an energy barrier and \tau_{0} the characteristic attempt time. Nevertheless, a monodisperse behavior cannot suitably describe the broad peaks in 1/T_{1} and one rather has to consider a distribution of correlation times associated with the nonuniform distribution of Mn impurities. This corresponds to a distribution of energy barriers which, for simplicity, was taken as squared with a width \Delta centered around \langle E_{a}\rangle[28]. In order to account for the high T behavior of 1/T_{1} a linear Korringa term \sigma[29], characteristic of metallic systems, was introduced (see Fig. 2). Then 1/T_{1} can be described by the expression [28]

\[\frac{1}{T_{1}} = \frac{\gamma^{2}\langle h_{\perp}^{2}\rangle T}{2\omega_{0}\Delta} \big{[}a\tan\big{(}\omega_{0}\tau_{0}e^{\langle E_{a}\rangle+\Delta\rangle/T} \big{)}\] (3) \[-a\tan\big{(}\omega_{0}\tau_{0}e^{\langle E_{a}\rangle-\Delta \rangle/T}\big{)}\big{]}+\alpha T.\]

By fitting the data of the superconducting samples (x<0.2% for LaVO and x\leqslant 0.5% for LaY20) one notices that for LaY20 spin correlations yield a significant increase in the width of the distribution on approaching the crossover between the superconducting and magnetic phases (Fig. 4). On the other hand, for the LaY20, within the uncertainty of the fit parameters, there is no evidence for a net increase of \Delta in the same doping range (Fig. 4). In other terms, in the LaY20 family the dynamics does not vary significantly upon increasing the Mn content up to x=0.5%, suggesting that the collective coupling is still weak.

Moreover, one may notice (Fig. 2) that for x\leqslant 0.5%, in the LaVO series the peak in 1/T_{1} grows significantly with Mn doping, while in the LaY20 series it remains practically unchanged. This evidences that 1/T_{1} increases progressively as T_{c}\to 0, namely, the strength of the local spin susceptibility in the FeAs plane becomes enhanced due to the proximity to the QCP. In other terms, for similar Mn contents the spin correlations get weaker as the chemical pressure is increased by Y doping. Further support in this respect is provided by the T dependence of ^{19}F NMR linewidth \Delta v which is directly related to the amplitude of the staggered magnetization developing around the impurity [12]. As shown in Fig. 5 for similar Mn doping ^{19}F NMR linewidth is unambiguously larger in the sample without Y. The data in Fig. 5 can be fitted with a Curie-Weiss law \Delta v=(\Delta v)_{0}+C/(T+\Theta). (\Delta v)_{0}\simeq 13 kHz is the T-independent linewidth due to nuclear dipole-dipole interaction which is assumed similar for both samples, since it is determined by nuclear dipolar coupling which remains practically unchanged (the F content and the lattice parameters do not vary significantly between the two samples [30]). This value is quite close to 14 kHz, the one estimated from dipolar lattice sums [31]. The fit of the data shows that C increases by a factor of 3 and that \Theta increases from about 3 K to 11 K between the x=0.3% LaY20 and x=0.2% LaY0 samples.

The observation that the magnetic correlations become depressed when La is substituted by a smaller lanthanide ion can in principle be associated with a decrease of the ratio U/t between Coulomb repulsion and hopping integral due to the increase in the chemical pressure. However, for stripe collinear order [\tilde{Q}=(\pi/a,0) or (0,\pi/a)] theoretical works [32,33]

Figure 3: (Color online) ^{19}F NMR 1/T_{1} in the x=0.1% LaY0 sample at two different magnetic fields: 0.7 and 1.5 T. Dashed lines are fits according to Eq. (3).

  suggest that in Ln1111 the magnetic order parameter should become enhanced on decreasing the Ln size or equivalently increasing the As z/c coordinate, exactly the opposite of what is found here. It should also be remarked that the behavior found upon Mn doping is contrary to that observed in Ru-substituted Fe-based superconductors where the magnetic order is stabilized by decreasing the size of the lanthanide [11]. Hence, it is likely that upon increasing x magnetic correlations different from the stripe ones develop. Giovannetti _et al._[33] showed, through Landau free energy calculations, that around optimal electron doping the energy difference between the stripe and orthomagnetic phases becomes reduced. Hence, it might be possible that the introduction of Mn impurities could stabilize the latter type of order.

More recently Gastiasoro and Andersen [34] have considered the cooperative behavior of paramagnetic impurities coupled via Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction in the Fe-based superconductors. They pointed out that upon increasing the Kondo-like coupling between the localized impurity and the itinerant electrons, Neel [\tilde{Q}=(\pi/a,\pi/a)] correlations would arise and the amplitude of collinear stripe modes decrease. However, even when the coupling becomes significant and Neel fluctuations enhanced, stripe spin correlations would still survive. In a real space description their results imply the development of Neel-type correlations in small islands around the impurity and stripe spin arrangement at larger distances from the impurity. Even if from ^{19}F NMR spectra we cannot check the validity of this model, this theoretical approach is able to explain both the weakening of the superconductivity [17] and the onset of a novel magnetic phase upon Mn doping [14]. In such a scenario the peaks in 1/T_{1} should be associated with the freezing of the spin fluctuations around Mn impurities which get more and more correlated as the QCP is approached. The theoretical model by Gastiasoro and Andersen [34] also allows one to make an analogy between heavy fermion physics and that achieved by doping Fe-based superconductor impurities. In this respect we recall that, similarly to heavy fermions, at the QCP there is a charge localization [13] suggesting a divergence of the electron effective mass. Hence, one should actually consider two possible concomitant effects which depress superconductivity: loss of spin excitations causing the pairing and/or charge localization. Once more, we remark that the behavior achieved by Mn doping is quite different from that observed in Ln1111 superconductors doped with Ru spinless impurities, where even at very high doping levels (\simeq50%) the system remains metallic [35].

An alternative explanation for the growth of low-frequency spin fluctuations in Mn-doped Ln1111 relies on the presence of nematic fluctuations. In this respect it is interesting to observe that even nominally pure samples do show a small bump in 1/T_{1}[25,36,37] in the same T range where the peak in ^{19}F NMR 1/T_{1} arises. The same low-frequency dynamics was found to affect the NMR transverse relaxation rate in Ba(Fe_{1-x}Rh_{x})_{2}As_{2} and was tentatively associated with nematic fluctuations [37], possibly involving charge stripes [36]. Although there is no neat evidence for the type of dynamics here, one may be tempted to relate the energy barrier probed by 1/T_{1} to the one separating the degenerate nematic phases [38]. In this framework the enhancement of the low-frequency dynamics could be associated with the pinning of those fluctuations by impurities.

In conclusion, the increase in the chemical pressure driven by Y for La substitution in La_{1-y}Y_{y}Fe_{1+x}Mn_{x}AsO_{0.89}F_{0.11} is found to lead to a less effective suppression of the superconducting ground state by Mn doping. ^{19}F NMR 1/T_{1} measurements exhibit a low-T peak which indicates the onset of very low-frequency dynamics with an amplitude directly related to the proximity of the compound to the QCP between superconducting and magnetic phases. Based on recent theoretical works, this behavior could be ascribed to the enhancement of spin correlations different from stripe ones, suggesting that T_{c} is depressed by the decrease in the spin fluctuations around (\pi/a,0), which are widely believed to mediate the pairing, or by the localization effect in the region close to the metal-insulator boundary.
