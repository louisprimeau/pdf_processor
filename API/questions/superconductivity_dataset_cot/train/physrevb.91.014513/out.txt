###### Abstract

The crystal structure, superconducting properties, and electronic structure of the novel superconducting 122-type antimonide BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} have been studied by measurements of powder x-ray diffraction patterns, electrical resistivity, a magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and by _ab initio_ calculations. The material crystallizes in a new monoclinic variant of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure, in which Pt_{2}Sb_{2} layers that consist of PtSb_{4} tetrahedra, and Sb_{2}Pt_{2} layers that consist of SbPt_{4} tetrahedra, are stacked alternatively, with Ba atoms located between them. Measurements of electrical resistivity, ac magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat revealed that BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is a superconducting material with a critical temperature of 1.8 K. The electronic heat capacity coefficient and the Debye temperature were 8.6 (2) mJ/mol K^{2} and 146(4) K, respectively. The upper critical field and the Ginzburg-Landau coherent length were determined to be 0.27 T and 35 nm, respectively. The calculations showed that the material has two three-dimensional Fermi surfaces (FSs) and two two-dimensional FSs, leading to anisotropic transport properties. The d states of the Pt atoms in the Pt_{2}Sb_{2} layers are the main contributors to the density of states at the Fermi level. A comparison between experimental and calculated results indicates that BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is a superconducting material with moderate coupling.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity with a critical temperature T_{\text{C}} of 26 K in LaFeAs(O,F) [1] has stimulated studies on superconducting iron pnictides, and various systems such as 1111, 122, and 11 have been discovered [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. AFe_{2}As_{2} (_A_ = Ba, Sr, Ca, or Eu) is the parent material for the superconducting 122 iron pnictides. Partial substitution of A, Fe, or As, or pressurization induces superconductivity with a relatively high T_{\text{C}}. For example, (Ba, K)Fe_{2}As_{2} and (Ca, La)Fe_{2}(As, P_{2}) have a T_{\text{C}} of 38 and 45 K, respectively [10, 11]. AFe_{2}As_{2} crystallizes with a ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure, in which A atoms are located between Fe_{2}As_{2} layers. Each Fe_{2}As_{2} layer comprises a square lattice of Fe atoms, each of which is surrounded by four As atoms in a tetrahedral coordination.

Superconductivity has also been observed in iron-free pnictides with a ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type or related structure, although their T_{\text{C}} values were relatively low [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. SrPt_{2}As_{2} is a superconductor with a T_{\text{C}} of 5.4 K [20]. It crystallizes in a modulated orthorhombic variant of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure, which is a derivative of the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure [21]. In CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type SrPt_{2}As_{2}, Sr atoms are sandwiched between two kinds of layers. One is a Pt_{2}As_{2} layer, which is a similar structure to the Fe_{2}As_{2} layer in _A_Fe_{2}As_{2}. The other is an As_{2}Pt_{2} layer, in which As atoms form a square lattice, with each being surrounded by four Pt atoms in a tetrahedral coordination. The electronic structure has been calculated for ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type SrPt_{2}As_{2}, which is a hypothetical material, and CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type SrPt_{2}As_{2}[22]. The results indicated that in the latter material, the Fermi surfaces (FSs) had characteristics that were intermediate between those for AFe_{2}As_{2} and ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-phase iron-free pnictides. AFe_{2}As_{2} has two-dimensional (2D) FSS [2, 3, 5, 6, 23, 24], while ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type iron-free pnictides have three-dimensional (3D) FS [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type SrPt_{2}As_{2} has two 2D FSs and two 3D FSs. The coexistence of 2D and 3D FSs has also been reported for CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type BaPd_{2}Sb_{2}[29]. Thus, some CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type iron-free pnictides are positioned between ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type iron pnictides and ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type iron-free pnictides from the viewpoint of ferrimology. Furthermore, the coexistence of 2D and 3D FSs is expected to cause multigap superconductivity, as in the case of MgB_{2}[30, 31], and this is an area of considerable interest in the field of superconductivity. Therefore, searching for superconducting CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type pnictides and studying their superconducting properties are important with regard to forming a systematic understanding of superconductivity in 122 pnictides.

However, superconducting materials that are structurally related to iron-based superconductors are limited to phosphides and arsenides. Recently, the 122 antimonide SrPt_{2}Sb_{2} has been reported to be a superconductor with a T_{\text{C}} of 2.1 K [32]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a superconducting 122 antimonide that is related to superconducting iron pnictides. As previously reported, the crystal structure of SrPt_{2}Sb_{2} is different to that of CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}[21]. Although a precise analysis of the crystal structure needs to be performed, it is possibly related to the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure. Since SrPt_{2}Sb_{2} isovalent to SrPt_{2}As_{2} and deduced to have a crystal structure related to that of CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}, SrPt_{2}Sb is expected to have both 3D and 2D FSs, and to exhibit physical properties that reflect this.

In this paper, we report on the successful synthesis of BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}, its crystal and electronic structures, and the appearance of superconductivity. To the best of our knowledge, BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is a novel material that has not so far been reported. A powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicates that it crystallizes in a monoclinic variant of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure. Measurements of electrical resistivity, ac magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat reveal that BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is a superconducting material with a T_{\rm C} of 1.82 K. _Ab initio_ calculations demonstrate that it has 3D and 2D FSs, and that the main contribution to the density of states at the Fermi level N(E_{\rm F}), which is responsible for its superconductivity, is from the d states of Pt.

## II Experimental Methods

The starting materials were Ba (purity 99.9%), Pt (purity 99.95%), and Sb (purity 99.999%). Samples were synthesized by Ar-arc melting of a 1.05:2:2 molar mixture of Ba, Pt, and Sb. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) revealed that the samples consisted of a matrix with a chemical composition of 20.2 at.% Ba, 40.6 at.% Pt, 39.3 at.% Sb, together with a small amount of Pt_{x}Sb precipitates.

The crystal structure was examined by powder XRD using a Bragg-Brentano diffractometer (RINT-TTR III, Rigaku) with Cu K\alpha radiation (40 kV, 300 mA), and a step size of 0.02^{\circ} in the 2\theta range of 15.0^{\circ}-120.0^{\circ} at room temperature. A fine powder sample was mounted on a glass plate holder with a depth of 0.3 mm. The XRD pattern was analyzed by the direct-space method with a simulated annealing algorithm, and subsequently refined by the Rietveld method [33] using the software "Fullprof" [34]. The background was modeled using a six-coefficient polynomial function.

The electrical resistivity \rho at temperatures ranging from 1.8 to 300.0 K was measured by a four-probe method using a physical properties measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design Co.). The magnetic field dependence of \rho was determined using a standard ac technique at a frequency (f) of \sim15 Hz.

The ac susceptibility \chi_{\rm ac}=\chi^{\prime}-i\,\chi^{\prime\prime} was evaluated by a mutual-inductance method with an ac modulation field of \mu_{0}\,H_{\rm ac}\sim 0.037\,mT and f\sim67 Hz using the same sample used for the ac resistivity measurements. The sample was cooled using a dilution fridge that was equipped with a superconducting magnet for applying an external field. The specific heat was measured by a relaxation method using the PPMS.

In order to investigate the electronic structure of BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}, _ab initio_ band calculations were performed for this compound. The full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave (FLAPW) scheme was used and the exchange-correlation potential was constructed within the local-density approximation. These were implemented using the kansai-94 and tspace[35] computer codes. The space group was C2/m (No. 12), and the lattice constants and atomic parameters were set to experimentally observed values (this work). The muffin-tin radii used in this calculation were 2.6 bohrs for Ba, 2.4 bohrs for Pt, and 2.3 bohrs for Sb. For the plane-wave basis functions, about 1000 LAPWs were used. Since this compound contains the heavy atoms Pt and Sb, the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) was included using a second-variational approach [36]. In this scheme, a scalar-relativistic calculation was first performed, and the SOI was then included iteratively.

## III Results and Discussion

### Crystal structure

Figure 1 shows a powder XRD pattern for BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} together with the results of a Rietveld analysis. The observed pattern can be reproduced well by assuming that BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} has a monoclinic structure with the parameters shown in Table 1, and that a small amount (0.8 mol%) of a PtSb impurity phase is present. Figure 2 illustrates the crystal structure of BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}. The blue solid lines represent a unit cell. This is a new monoclinic variant of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure. In this structure, the Pt1 and Sb2 atoms form Pt_{2}Sb_{2} layers that consist of PtSb_{4} tetrahedra, while the Pt2 and Sb1 atoms form Sb_{2}Pt_{2}

The difference between the two intensities is indicated by the blue line shifted by -7000 counts. Peak positions for BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} and the PtSb impurity are labeled by green and purple vertical bars located at -2000 and -4000 counts, respectively.

  layers that consist of SbPt_{4} tetrahedra. These layers are stacked alternatively along the [001] direction, with Ba atoms between them. This crystal structure is similar to that for CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}, but some differences exist. First, the angle between the c axis and the a-b plane, \beta_{\rm{uc}}, is 91.227^{\circ}, whereas the three angles \alpha_{\rm{uc}}, \beta_{\rm{uc}}, and \gamma_{\rm{uc}}, are 90^{\circ} in the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure [Fig. 2(d)]. Second, the Pt1 (or Sb1) atoms form a deformed square lattice in the Pt_{2}Sb_{2} (or Sb_{2}Pt_{2}) layers in the proposed structure, whereas Pt (or Sb) atoms form a square lattice in the Pt_{2}Sb_{2} (or Sb_{2}Pt_{2}) layers in CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} (hypothetical) as shown in Figs. 2(e) and 2(f). The shape of the lattice formed by Pt1 (or Sb1) atoms is isosceles trapezoid, and the degree of deformation in the Pt1 lattice is larger than that for Sb1 atoms. The Pt1 (or Sb1) atoms are aligned along the b-axis direction, whereas they form a zigzag pattern along the a-axis direction. Third, the Pt1 (or Sb1) deformed square lattice in the proposed structure is almost parallel to the a and b axes, whereas the square lattice in the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure is rotated 45^{\circ} relative to the a and b axes [Figs. 2(e) and 2(f)].

A monoclinic variant of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure has been reported in materials such as LnPt_{2}Ge_{2} (Ln = La - Dy) [37] and a high-pressure phase of SrPt_{2}As_{2}[21], and this variant is known as the LaPt_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure. The LaPt_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure can be obtained from the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure by changing the b-axis length and increasing the unit-cell angle \beta from 90^{\circ} by several tenths of a degree. The relation between the unit-cell axis and the square Pt lattice is different for the LaPt_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure and the proposed crystal structure of BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}. In the LaPt_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure, the square lattice is rotated by 45^{\circ} relative to the a and b axes, as in the case of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure, whereas the square lattice is almost parallel to the a and b axes in BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed structure is a completely different one.

Table 2 lists interatomic distances. The intralayer interatomic distance has two values of 2.681(3) and 2.734(3) A, which are both similar to the interlayer interatomic distance of 2.708(7) A. This indicates that the crystal structure is three dimensional. The T_{\rm{C}} for iron-based superconductors has often been discussed in terms of two structural parameters, the Pn-Fe-Pn angle in FePn_{4} tetrahedra, and the Pn elevation above the Fe square lattice, where Pn represents pnictogen [38, 39, 40]. The Sb-Pt-Sb angles in the PtSb_{4} tetrahedra and the Pt-Sb-Pt angles in the SbPt_{4} tetrahedra are far from the ideal regular tetrahedron angle of 109.5^{\circ} that is thought to be favorable for a high T_{\rm{C}} in the iron pnictides. The Sb elevation above the distorted Pt square lattice is similar to the Pn elevation for iron pnictides with a high T_{\rm{C}}.

The crystal structure of SrPt_{2}Sb_{2} was reported to be different from the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type [32], but has not been determined yet. This structure proposed in this paper may help to clarify the crystal structure of SrPt_{2}Sb_{2}.

### Electrical resistivity, ac magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and magnetic phase diagram

Based on the results of electrical resistivity, ac magnetic susceptibility, and specific-heat measurements, it was found that BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} undergoes a superconducting transition.

Figure 3(a) shows the electrical resistivity \rho as a function of temperature, where the inset is an expanded view at low temperatures. It can be seen that \rho decreases with decreasing temperature, undergoes an abrupt drop at 1.85 K, and becomes negligibly small at 1.82 K, which suggests that BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} undergoes a normal-to-superconducting transition. The residual resistivity ratio \rho (300 K) / \rho (2 K) is 4.04. Figure 3(b) shows \rho measured at constant temperatures as a function of the magnetic field strength. Under an applied magnetic field, the sample underwent a superconducting-to-normal transition. The symbols H_{\text{C}2}\rho^{,0n}, H_{\text{C}2}\rho^{,\text{mid}}, and H_{\text{C}2}\rho^{,\text{comp}} represent the magnetic field strength at which \rho starts to increase from zero, that where \rho is half the normal resistivity value, and that where an extrapolation of the \rho-T curve at the transition reaches the normal resistivity value, respectively. The critical field increases with decreasing temperature, as will be discussed in more detail later.

Figure 4 shows the real and imaginary parts of the ac magnetic susceptibility \chi^{\prime} and \chi^{\prime\prime}, respectively, measured at constant temperatures below 1.44 K as a function of magnetic field amplitude \mu_{0}H. The inset is an expanded view of \chi^{\prime} measured at 0.03 K. The \chi^{\prime} curves reflect a diamagnetic signal at low \mu_{0}H, and this disappears at the point \mu_{0}H_{\text{C}2}\chi^{\prime}. The \chi^{\prime\prime} curves exhibit a peak at a magnetic field amplitude almost corresponding to the inflection point in the \chi^{\prime} curves. The shoulder observed at low \mu_{0}H in the \chi^{\prime\prime} curves is due to a background signal associated with the apparatus. This behavior of \chi^{\prime} and \chi^{\prime\prime} suggests that BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} becomes superconducting in this temperature range [41], and that the abrupt decrease in \rho at 1.85 K corresponds to a superconducting transition. The magnitude of the diamagnetic signal for BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} was investigated by comparing it with that for a Pb sample with the same shape and size. At 1.6 K, the two signals had almost the same magnitude, and since Pb is a perfect diamagnetic at this temperature, the superconducting volume fraction in BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} was almost 100%.

Figure 5(a) shows the specific heat divided by the temperature C/T as a function of T^{2}, measured for different magnetic field strengths. At 0 T, an anomaly appears around 1.7 K, and this shifts to lower temperature and becomes smaller with increasing magnetic field, until it finally disappears at 0.2 T. This large specific-heat anomaly and the large diamagnetic signal in \chi^{\prime} indicate that the observed superconductivity is bulk superconductivity. These results reveal that BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is a superconducting material with a T_{\text{C}} of 1.8 K.

The electronic specific-heat coefficient \gamma_{\text{a}}, and the coefficients \beta and \delta were determined to be 8.6 (2) mJ/mol K^{2}, 2.32 (6) mJ/mol K^{4}, and 0.111 (5) mJ/mol K^{6}, respectively, by fitting the equation C/T=\gamma_{\text{a}}+\beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4} to the data obtained at 0.2 T. The Debye temperature \theta_{\text{D}} was calculated to be 146(4) K from the value of \beta. In order to confirm the validity of the fit, the difference in the entropy S between the normal and superconducting states S_{\text{es}}-S_{\text{en}} was calculated

Figure 4: (Color online) Real and imaginary parts of ac magnetic susceptibility \chi^{\prime} and \chi^{\prime\prime}, respectively, measured at constant temperatures below 1.44 K as a function of magnetic field amplitude \mu_{0}H. The inset shows an expanded view of \chi^{\prime} measured at 0.03 K. H_{\text{C}2}\chi^{\prime} indicates the magnetic field amplitude where the diamagnetic signal disappears.

Figure 3: (Color online) (a) Electrical resistivity as a function of temperature, (b) electrical resistivity at fixed temperatures as a function of magnetic field strength. The inset in Fig. 3(a) is an expanded view of the resistivity at low temperatures ranging from 1.8 to 2.1 K. The symbols H_{\text{C}2}\rho^{,\text{on}}, H_{\text{C}2}\rho^{,\text{mid}}, and H_{\text{C}2}\rho^{,\text{comp}} represent the magnetic field strength at which \rho starts to increase from zero, that at which \rho is half the normal resistivity value, and that at which an extrapolation of the \rho-T curve during the transition reaches the normal resistivity value, respectively.

 by integrating \left(C_{\text{es}}-\gamma_{\text{n}}\right)/T between 0 and 2 K, where C_{\text{es}} is the electronic specific heat for the superconducting state. C_{\text{es}} is obtained by subtracting the phonon specific heat C_{\text{ph}}=\beta T^{3}+\delta T^{5} from C (0 T) and extrapolating C_{\text{es}} (0 T) to 0 K. The entropy difference goes to zero when the temperature reaches 1.8 K, as shown in the inset, which confirms the thermodynamic consistency of the fit.

In Fig. 5(b), the difference in C/T between 0 and 0.2 T, \left[C\left(0\text{T}\right)-C\left(0.2\text{T}\right)\right]/T, is shown as a function of the temperature. The dashed line represents an entropy-conserving construction. The transition to the superconducting state with the entropy-conserving construction gives \Delta C\left(T_{\text{C}}\right)/T_{\text{C}}=11.8(2) mJ/mol K^{2} and T_{\text{C}}=1.66 K. The ratio of the specific-heat jump at T_{\text{C}} to \gamma_{\text{n}}, \Delta C\left(T_{\text{C}}\right)/\gamma_{\text{n}}T_{\text{C}}, is calculated to be 1.37, which is almost the same as that predicted by BCS theory (1.43) [42].

The anomaly in the C/T-T curve has a shoulder at 1.76 K. A detailed investigation of the shoulder region is currently underway. However, it is possibly the result of multigap superconductivity or spatial inhomogeneity in the chemical composition of the samples.

Figure 6(a) is a magnetic field-temperature phase diagram deduced from the measurements of electrical resistivity, ac magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat. The empty triangles, circles, and rhombus represent T_{\text{C}}^{\text{-con}}, T_{\text{C}}^{\text{-mid}}, and T_{\text{C}}^{\text{-con}}app shown in Fig. 3(b). The solid squares represent H_{\text{C}}^{\text{-mid}}, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4. The solid triangles represent the superconducting critical temperature T_{\text{C}}^{\text{SH}} determined from the specific-heat data using the entropy-conserving construction.

Figure 6(b) shows the reduced magnetic field h^{\ast} as a function of the reduced temperature t^{\ast}, where h^{\ast}\!=\!H/(-dH/dT)T_{\text{C}} and t^{\ast}\!=\!T/T_{\text{C}}. The dashed-dotted dotted lines show h^{\ast} calculated using the pair-breaking model proposed by Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenber (WHH), in the clean and dirty limits [43, 44, 45], respectively. The h^{\ast}-t^{\ast} curve obtained from the resistivity data agrees with those obtained from the ac magnetic susceptibility and specific-heat data. The t^{\ast} dependence of h^{\ast} deviates from the calculated curve. The value of H_{\text{C}}^{\text{-2}} (0) was therefore determined to be 0.27 T from \mu_{0}H_{\text{C}}^{\text{-2-con}}. This value is approximately one-tenth of the Pauli limiting field \mu_{0}H_{\text{p}} (3.31 T), defined as

The inset in Fig. 5(a) shows the difference in entropy S between the normal and superconducting states S_{\text{es}}-S_{\text{m}} as a function of temperature.

Figure 6: (Color online) (a) Magnetic field-temperature phase diagram deduced from measurements of electrical resistivity, ac magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat. The empty triangles, circles, and rhombus indicate T_{\text{C}}^{\text{-con}}, T_{\text{C}}^{\text{-2-mid}}, and T_{\text{C}}^{\text{-2-con}}app, shown in Fig. 3(b). The solid squares and triangles represent H_{\text{C}} determined from \gamma^{\prime}, and T_{\text{C}} determined from the specific-heat data, respectively. (b) Reduced magnetic field h^{\ast} as a function of reduced temperature t^{\ast}, where h^{\ast}\!=\!H/(-dH/dT)T_{\text{C}} and t^{\ast}\!=\!T/T_{\text{C}}. The dashed-dotted and dotted lines show h^{\ast} calculated using a pair-breaking model in the clean and dirty limits, respectively.

  H_{\rm p}=18.4T_{\rm C} (kOe) [46, 47], which indicates the absence of Pauli limiting in BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherent length \xi (0) was determined to be 35 nm using the formula H_{\rm C2}(0)=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi(0)^{2}, where \Phi_{0} is the flux quantum [42].

As described above, the t^{*} dependence of h^{*} deviates from the calculated curve based on the pair-breaking model proposed by WHH, assuming that the superconductor has a single superconducting gap. A similar deviation has been observed for iron pnictides such as LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x}[48], Co-doped SrFe_{2}As_{2}[49], and Co-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}[50], and was interpreted within the framework of a two-gap model. A theory for two-gap superconductors indicated that the T-H_{\rm C2} (T) curve can differ from that predicted by single-gap theory, and that H_{\rm C2} (0) can considerably exceed the value determined based on the one-gap model in the dirty limit, 0.7T_{\rm C}d\,H_{\rm C2}/dT_{\rm C}[51]. In the case of MgB_{2}, two superconducting gaps are formed as a result of a 2D cylindrical FS and a 3D tubular-network FS [31, 32]. BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} has four FS sheets with different dimensionality and carrier type. Two are 2D electronlike FSs and two are 3D holelike FSs, as later calculations will show. Therefore, these FSs are expected to form multiple superconducting gaps in BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}, as in the case of MgB_{2}. Therefore, the observed deviation in the t^{*}-h^{*} curve might be due to such multigap superconductivity. Further study using single-crystalline samples is necessary in order to confirm whether the presence of multiple gaps plays an important role in the superconductivity of BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}.

### Electronic structure

Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the band structure and the total and partial density of states (DOS) for BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}. The bands in the energy range from -0.2 to 0.0 Ry mainly consists of Sb s-states. The bands in the energy range from 0.1 to 0.7 Ry mainly consist of Sb p and Pt d states. Above 0.7 Ry, the bands originate from the Ba d and Pt d states. Since the bands associated with Pt and Sb are broad, the correlation is deduced to be weak in BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}. Four bands cross the Fermi level E_{\rm F}, as can be seen clearly on the \Gamma-Y line. N(E_{\rm F}) is 29.8 states/Ry/chemical formula unit, or 2.58 states/eV/chemical formula unit. Figure 8(b) shows an expanded view of the partial DOS near E_{\rm F}. N(E_{\rm F}) mainly consists of Sb p and Pt d states, and the contribution from the Pt d states is larger, particularly for Pt1 atoms (Pt atoms at 4g site in Table 1). The contributions of the Pt2\,d, Sb2\,p, and Sb1\,p states are approximately one half, one third, and one fifth of that of the Pt1 d states, respectively. It is worth noting that the Pt1 atoms are in PtSb_{4} tetrahedra in the Pt_{2}Sb_{2} layers. These results suggest that carrier conduction mainly occurs in these layers.

The four bands that cross E_{\rm F} on the \Gamma-Y line from the \Gamma to Y points are the 37th, 38th, 39th, and 40th bands from the bottom, respectively, which results in four FS sheets, as illustrated in Fig. 9. The sheets formed by the 37th and 38th bands are holelike, whereas the other two are electronlike. The 37th and 38th bands form 3D FSs around the \Gamma point. The 39th and 40th bands form 2D FSs with a cylindrical shape along the k_{x} direction at the corners near the M point.

The shape of the FSs in BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is similar to that observed in BaPd_{2}Sb_{2}[29] and SrPt_{2}As_{2}[22] in that there are two 3D FSs and two 2D FSs. However, the carrier types are different. SrPt_{2}As_{2} has one holelike FS and three electronlike FSs, whereas BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} has two holelike FSs and two electronlike FSs, as in the case of BaPd_{2}Sb_{2}.

The anisotropic shape of the FSs is expected to be reflected in anisotropic transport properties. To investigate this, the Fermi velocity components v_{\rm F}^{\rm x} and v_{\rm F}^{\rm z} were calculated

  assuming the angle \beta_{\rm ac} in the unit cell to be 90^{\circ} because the first two digits in the Fermi velocities are the same for crystal structures with \beta_{\rm ac} values of 90^{\circ} and 91.227^{\circ}. Table 3 lists the average values of v_{\rm F}^{x} and v_{\rm F}^{z}, and the ratio v_{\rm F}^{x}/v_{\rm F}^{z} for BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} together with the two polymorphs BaPd_{2}Sb_{2} and SrPt_{2}As_{2}. The v_{\rm F}^{z}/v_{\rm F}^{z} values are clearly greater than unity for BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} and the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type materials, which suggests that these materials have anisotropic transport properties. On the other hand, those for the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type materials are close to unity, suggesting isotropic transport properties. Thus, the existence of 2D FSs in BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} and the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type materials is reflected in anisotropic transport properties.

Table 4 lists T_{\rm C}, \gamma_{\rm a}, \theta_{\rm D}, N(E_{\rm F}), and the electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda for BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}, SrPt_{2}Sb_{2}[32], LaPd_{2}Sb_{2}[52], and SrPt_{2}As_{2}[20, 22]. LaPd_{2}Sb_{2} is a recently reported superconducting material (T_{\rm C} = 1.4 K) with the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure. \gamma_{\rm a}^{\rm ext} is \gamma_{\rm a} obtained from specific-heat measurements and \gamma_{\rm a}^{\rm calc} is \gamma_{\rm a} calculated using the equation \gamma_{\rm a}^{\rm calc} = (\pi^{2}/3)N(E_{F})k_{B}^{2}.\lambda was estimated to be 0.67 for BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} using the relation \gamma_{\rm a}^{\rm expt} = (1 + \lambda)_{\rm f}^{\rm calc}. BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is a superconducting material with moderate coupling. The value of \gamma_{\rm a}^{\rm expt} for BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is comparable to those for SrPt_{2}Sb_{2} and SrPt_{2}Sb_{2}, and is slightly larger than that for LaPd_{2}Sb_{2}. \theta_{\rm D} for BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is the smallest among the four compounds. The value of \lambda is comparable to that for SrPt_{2}As_{2}.

## IV Conclusion

This study clearly demonstrated that the 122-type antimonide, BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}, which is structurally related to the iron-based superconductors, shows superconductivity with a T_{\rm C} of 1.8 K. BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} crystallizes in a new monoclinic variant of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure. Calculations showed that it has two 3D FSs and two 2D FSs, which results in anisotropic transport properties. The d states of Pt atoms in PbSb_{4} tetrahedra in the Pt_{2}Sb_{2} layers make the main contribution to N(E_{\rm F}). A comparison between experimental and calculation results indicated that BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is a superconducting material with moderate coupling.

This study also demonstrated that unknown variants of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure may exist in 122-type pnictides. It is therefore worthwhile to search for superconducting 122 antimonides with a CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure or variant since this can lead to the discovery of new superconducting materials. Since the calculated electronic structure for CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type iron-free pnictides indicates that they have characteristics intermediate between those for ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type iron and iron-free pnictides, this will also aid in forming a systematic understanding of superconductivity in 122 pnictides.

###### Abstract

The crystal structure, superconducting properties, and electronic structure of the novel superconducting 122-type antimonide BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} have been studied by measurements of powder x-ray diffraction patterns, electrical resistivity, a magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and by _ab initio_ calculations. The material crystallizes in a new monoclinic variant of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure, in which Pt_{2}Sb_{2} layers that consist of PtSb_{4} tetrahedra, and Sb_{2}Pt_{2} layers that consist of SbPt_{4} tetrahedra, are stacked alternatively, with Ba atoms located between them. Measurements of electrical resistivity, ac magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat revealed that BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is a superconducting material with a critical temperature of 1.8 K. The electronic heat capacity coefficient and the Debye temperature were 8.6 (2) mJ/mol K^{2} and 146(4) K, respectively. The upper critical field and the Ginzburg-Landau coherent length were determined to be 0.27 T and 35 nm, respectively. The calculations showed that the material has two three-dimensional Fermi surfaces (FSs) and two two-dimensional FSs, leading to anisotropic transport properties. The d states of the Pt atoms in the Pt_{2}Sb_{2} layers are the main contributors to the density of states at the Fermi level. A comparison between experimental and calculated results indicates that BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is a superconducting material with moderate coupling.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity with a critical temperature T_{\text{C}} of 26 K in LaFeAs(O,F) [1] has stimulated studies on superconducting iron pnictides, and various systems such as 1111, 122, and 11 have been discovered [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. AFe_{2}As_{2} (_A_ = Ba, Sr, Ca, or Eu) is the parent material for the superconducting 122 iron pnictides. Partial substitution of A, Fe, or As, or pressurization induces superconductivity with a relatively high T_{\text{C}}. For example, (Ba, K)Fe_{2}As_{2} and (Ca, La)Fe_{2}(As, P_{2}) have a T_{\text{C}} of 38 and 45 K, respectively [10, 11]. AFe_{2}As_{2} crystallizes with a ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure, in which A atoms are located between Fe_{2}As_{2} layers. Each Fe_{2}As_{2} layer comprises a square lattice of Fe atoms, each of which is surrounded by four As atoms in a tetrahedral coordination.

Superconductivity has also been observed in iron-free pnictides with a ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type or related structure, although their T_{\text{C}} values were relatively low [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. SrPt_{2}As_{2} is a superconductor with a T_{\text{C}} of 5.4 K [20]. It crystallizes in a modulated orthorhombic variant of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure, which is a derivative of the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure [21]. In CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type SrPt_{2}As_{2}, Sr atoms are sandwiched between two kinds of layers. One is a Pt_{2}As_{2} layer, which is a similar structure to the Fe_{2}As_{2} layer in _A_Fe_{2}As_{2}. The other is an As_{2}Pt_{2} layer, in which As atoms form a square lattice, with each being surrounded by four Pt atoms in a tetrahedral coordination. The electronic structure has been calculated for ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type SrPt_{2}As_{2}, which is a hypothetical material, and CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type SrPt_{2}As_{2}[22]. The results indicated that in the latter material, the Fermi surfaces (FSs) had characteristics that were intermediate between those for AFe_{2}As_{2} and ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-phase iron-free pnictides. AFe_{2}As_{2} has two-dimensional (2D) FSS [2, 3, 5, 6, 23, 24], while ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type iron-free pnictides have three-dimensional (3D) FS [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type SrPt_{2}As_{2} has two 2D FSs and two 3D FSs. The coexistence of 2D and 3D FSs has also been reported for CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type BaPd_{2}Sb_{2}[29]. Thus, some CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type iron-free pnictides are positioned between ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type iron pnictides and ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type iron-free pnictides from the viewpoint of ferrimology. Furthermore, the coexistence of 2D and 3D FSs is expected to cause multigap superconductivity, as in the case of MgB_{2}[30, 31], and this is an area of considerable interest in the field of superconductivity. Therefore, searching for superconducting CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type pnictides and studying their superconducting properties are important with regard to forming a systematic understanding of superconductivity in 122 pnictides.

However, superconducting materials that are structurally related to iron-based superconductors are limited to phosphides and arsenides. Recently, the 122 antimonide SrPt_{2}Sb_{2} has been reported to be a superconductor with a T_{\text{C}} of 2.1 K [32]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a superconducting 122 antimonide that is related to superconducting iron pnictides. As previously reported, the crystal structure of SrPt_{2}Sb_{2} is different to that of CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}[21]. Although a precise analysis of the crystal structure needs to be performed, it is possibly related to the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure. Since SrPt_{2}Sb_{2} isovalent to SrPt_{2}As_{2} and deduced to have a crystal structure related to that of CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}, SrPt_{2}Sb is expected to have both 3D and 2D FSs, and to exhibit physical properties that reflect this.

In this paper, we report on the successful synthesis of BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}, its crystal and electronic structures, and the appearance of superconductivity. To the best of our knowledge, BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is a novel material that has not so far been reported. A powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicates that it crystallizes in a monoclinic variant of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure. Measurements of electrical resistivity, ac magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat reveal that BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is a superconducting material with a T_{\rm C} of 1.82 K. _Ab initio_ calculations demonstrate that it has 3D and 2D FSs, and that the main contribution to the density of states at the Fermi level N(E_{\rm F}), which is responsible for its superconductivity, is from the d states of Pt.

## II Experimental Methods

The starting materials were Ba (purity 99.9%), Pt (purity 99.95%), and Sb (purity 99.999%). Samples were synthesized by Ar-arc melting of a 1.05:2:2 molar mixture of Ba, Pt, and Sb. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) revealed that the samples consisted of a matrix with a chemical composition of 20.2 at.% Ba, 40.6 at.% Pt, 39.3 at.% Sb, together with a small amount of Pt_{x}Sb precipitates.

The crystal structure was examined by powder XRD using a Bragg-Brentano diffractometer (RINT-TTR III, Rigaku) with Cu K\alpha radiation (40 kV, 300 mA), and a step size of 0.02^{\circ} in the 2\theta range of 15.0^{\circ}-120.0^{\circ} at room temperature. A fine powder sample was mounted on a glass plate holder with a depth of 0.3 mm. The XRD pattern was analyzed by the direct-space method with a simulated annealing algorithm, and subsequently refined by the Rietveld method [33] using the software "Fullprof" [34]. The background was modeled using a six-coefficient polynomial function.

The electrical resistivity \rho at temperatures ranging from 1.8 to 300.0 K was measured by a four-probe method using a physical properties measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design Co.). The magnetic field dependence of \rho was determined using a standard ac technique at a frequency (f) of \sim15 Hz.

The ac susceptibility \chi_{\rm ac}=\chi^{\prime}-i\,\chi^{\prime\prime} was evaluated by a mutual-inductance method with an ac modulation field of \mu_{0}\,H_{\rm ac}\sim 0.037\,mT and f\sim67 Hz using the same sample used for the ac resistivity measurements. The sample was cooled using a dilution fridge that was equipped with a superconducting magnet for applying an external field. The specific heat was measured by a relaxation method using the PPMS.

In order to investigate the electronic structure of BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}, _ab initio_ band calculations were performed for this compound. The full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave (FLAPW) scheme was used and the exchange-correlation potential was constructed within the local-density approximation. These were implemented using the kansai-94 and tspace[35] computer codes. The space group was C2/m (No. 12), and the lattice constants and atomic parameters were set to experimentally observed values (this work). The muffin-tin radii used in this calculation were 2.6 bohrs for Ba, 2.4 bohrs for Pt, and 2.3 bohrs for Sb. For the plane-wave basis functions, about 1000 LAPWs were used. Since this compound contains the heavy atoms Pt and Sb, the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) was included using a second-variational approach [36]. In this scheme, a scalar-relativistic calculation was first performed, and the SOI was then included iteratively.

## III Results and Discussion

### Crystal structure

Figure 1 shows a powder XRD pattern for BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} together with the results of a Rietveld analysis. The observed pattern can be reproduced well by assuming that BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} has a monoclinic structure with the parameters shown in Table 1, and that a small amount (0.8 mol%) of a PtSb impurity phase is present. Figure 2 illustrates the crystal structure of BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}. The blue solid lines represent a unit cell. This is a new monoclinic variant of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure. In this structure, the Pt1 and Sb2 atoms form Pt_{2}Sb_{2} layers that consist of PtSb_{4} tetrahedra, while the Pt2 and Sb1 atoms form Sb_{2}Pt_{2}

The difference between the two intensities is indicated by the blue line shifted by -7000 counts.

This crystal structure is similar to that for CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}, but some differences exist. First, the angle between the c axis and the a-b plane, \beta_{\rm{uc}}, is 91.227^{\circ}, whereas the three angles \alpha_{\rm{uc}}, \beta_{\rm{uc}}, and \gamma_{\rm{uc}}, are 90^{\circ} in the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure [Fig. 2(d)]. Second, the Pt1 (or Sb1) atoms form a deformed square lattice in the Pt_{2}Sb_{2} (or Sb_{2}Pt_{2}) layers in the proposed structure, whereas Pt (or Sb) atoms form a square lattice in the Pt_{2}Sb_{2} (or Sb_{2}Pt_{2}) layers in CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} (hypothetical) as shown in Figs. 2(e) and 2(f). The shape of the lattice formed by Pt1 (or Sb1) atoms is isosceles trapezoid, and the degree of deformation in the Pt1 lattice is larger than that for Sb1 atoms. The Pt1 (or Sb1) atoms are aligned along the b-axis direction, whereas they form a zigzag pattern along the a-axis direction. Third, the Pt1 (or Sb1) deformed square lattice in the proposed structure is almost parallel to the a and b axes, whereas the square lattice in the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure is rotated 45^{\circ} relative to the a and b axes [Figs. 2(e) and 2(f)].

A monoclinic variant of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure has been reported in materials such as LnPt_{2}Ge_{2} (Ln = La - Dy) [37] and a high-pressure phase of SrPt_{2}As_{2}[21], and this variant is known as the LaPt_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure. The LaPt_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure can be obtained from the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure by changing the b-axis length and increasing the unit-cell angle \beta from 90^{\circ} by several tenths of a degree. The relation between the unit-cell axis and the square Pt lattice is different for the LaPt_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure and the proposed crystal structure of BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}. In the LaPt_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure, the square lattice is rotated by 45^{\circ} relative to the a and b axes, as in the case of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure, whereas the square lattice is almost parallel to the a and b axes in BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed structure is a completely different one.

Table 2 lists interatomic distances. The intralayer interatomic distance has two values of 2.681(3) and 2.734(3) A, which are both similar to the interlayer interatomic distance of 2.708(7) A. This indicates that the crystal structure is three dimensional. The T_{\rm{C}} for iron-based superconductors has often been discussed in terms of two structural parameters, the Pn-Fe-Pn angle in FePn_{4} tetrahedra, and the Pn elevation above the Fe square lattice, where Pn represents pnictogen [38, 39, 40]. The Sb-Pt-Sb angles in the PtSb_{4} tetrahedra and the Pt-Sb-Pt angles in the SbPt_{4} tetrahedra are far from the ideal regular tetrahedron angle of 109.5^{\circ} that is thought to be favorable for a high T_{\rm{C}} in the iron pnictides. The Sb elevation above the distorted Pt square lattice is similar to the Pn elevation for iron pnictides with a high T_{\rm{C}}.

The crystal structure of SrPt_{2}Sb_{2} was reported to be different from the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type [32], but has not been determined yet. This structure proposed in this paper may help to clarify the crystal structure of SrPt_{2}Sb_{2}.

### Electrical resistivity, ac magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and magnetic phase diagram

Based on the results of electrical resistivity, ac magnetic susceptibility, and specific-heat measurements, it was found that BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} undergoes a superconducting transition.

Figure 3(a) shows the electrical resistivity \rho as a function of temperature, where the inset is an expanded view at low temperatures. It can be seen that \rho decreases with decreasing temperature, undergoes an abrupt drop at 1.85 K, and becomes negligibly small at 1.82 K, which suggests that BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} undergoes a normal-to-superconducting transition. The residual resistivity ratio \rho (300 K) / \rho (2 K) is 4.04. Figure 3(b) shows \rho measured at constant temperatures as a function of the magnetic field strength. Under an applied magnetic field, the sample underwent a superconducting-to-normal transition. The symbols H_{\text{C}2}\rho^{,0n}, H_{\text{C}2}\rho^{,\text{mid}}, and H_{\text{C}2}\rho^{,\text{comp}} represent the magnetic field strength at which \rho starts to increase from zero, that where \rho is half the normal resistivity value, and that where an extrapolation of the \rho-T curve at the transition reaches the normal resistivity value, respectively. The critical field increases with decreasing temperature, as will be discussed in more detail later.

Figure 4 shows the real and imaginary parts of the ac magnetic susceptibility \chi^{\prime} and \chi^{\prime\prime}, respectively, measured at constant temperatures below 1.44 K as a function of magnetic field amplitude \mu_{0}H. The inset is an expanded view of \chi^{\prime} measured at 0.03 K. The \chi^{\prime} curves reflect a diamagnetic signal at low \mu_{0}H, and this disappears at the point \mu_{0}H_{\text{C}2}\chi^{\prime}. The \chi^{\prime\prime} curves exhibit a peak at a magnetic field amplitude almost corresponding to the inflection point in the \chi^{\prime} curves. The shoulder observed at low \mu_{0}H in the \chi^{\prime\prime} curves is due to a background signal associated with the apparatus. This behavior of \chi^{\prime} and \chi^{\prime\prime} suggests that BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} becomes superconducting in this temperature range [41], and that the abrupt decrease in \rho at 1.85 K corresponds to a superconducting transition. The magnitude of the diamagnetic signal for BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} was investigated by comparing it with that for a Pb sample with the same shape and size. At 1.6 K, the two signals had almost the same magnitude, and since Pb is a perfect diamagnetic at this temperature, the superconducting volume fraction in BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} was almost 100%.

Figure 5(a) shows the specific heat divided by the temperature C/T as a function of T^{2}, measured for different magnetic field strengths. At 0 T, an anomaly appears around 1.7 K, and this shifts to lower temperature and becomes smaller with increasing magnetic field, until it finally disappears at 0.2 T. This large specific-heat anomaly and the large diamagnetic signal in \chi^{\prime} indicate that the observed superconductivity is bulk superconductivity. These results reveal that BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is a superconducting material with a T_{\text{C}} of 1.8 K.

The electronic specific-heat coefficient \gamma_{\text{a}}, and the coefficients \beta and \delta were determined to be 8.6 (2) mJ/mol K^{2}, 2.32 (6) mJ/mol K^{4}, and 0.111 (5) mJ/mol K^{6}, respectively, by fitting the equation C/T=\gamma_{\text{a}}+\beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4} to the data obtained at 0.2 T. The Debye temperature \theta_{\text{D}} was calculated to be 146(4) K from the value of \beta. In order to confirm the validity of the fit, the difference in the entropy S between the normal and superconducting states S_{\text{es}}-S_{\text{en}} was calculated

Figure 4: (Color online) Real and imaginary parts of ac magnetic susceptibility \chi^{\prime} and \chi^{\prime\prime}, respectively, measured at constant temperatures below 1.44 K as a function of magnetic field amplitude \mu_{0}H. The inset shows an expanded view of \chi^{\prime} measured at 0.03 K. H_{\text{C}2}\chi^{\prime} indicates the magnetic field amplitude where the diamagnetic signal disappears.

Figure 3: (Color online) (a) Electrical resistivity as a function of temperature, (b) electrical resistivity at fixed temperatures as a function of magnetic field strength. The inset in Fig. 3(a) is an expanded view of the resistivity at low temperatures ranging from 1.8 to 2.1 K. The symbols H_{\text{C}2}\rho^{,\text{on}}, H_{\text{C}2}\rho^{,\text{mid}}, and H_{\text{C}2}\rho^{,\text{comp}} represent the magnetic field strength at which \rho starts to increase from zero, that at which \rho is half the normal resistivity value, and that at which an extrapolation of the \rho-T curve during the transition reaches the normal resistivity value, respectively.

 by integrating \left(C_{\text{es}}-\gamma_{\text{n}}\right)/T between 0 and 2 K, where C_{\text{es}} is the electronic specific heat for the superconducting state. C_{\text{es}} is obtained by subtracting the phonon specific heat C_{\text{ph}}=\beta T^{3}+\delta T^{5} from C (0 T) and extrapolating C_{\text{es}} (0 T) to 0 K. The entropy difference goes to zero when the temperature reaches 1.8 K, as shown in the inset, which confirms the thermodynamic consistency of the fit.

In Fig. 5(b), the difference in C/T between 0 and 0.2 T, \left[C\left(0\text{T}\right)-C\left(0.2\text{T}\right)\right]/T, is shown as a function of the temperature. The dashed line represents an entropy-conserving construction. The transition to the superconducting state with the entropy-conserving construction gives \Delta C\left(T_{\text{C}}\right)/T_{\text{C}}=11.8(2) mJ/mol K^{2} and T_{\text{C}}=1.66 K. The ratio of the specific-heat jump at T_{\text{C}} to \gamma_{\text{n}}, \Delta C\left(T_{\text{C}}\right)/\gamma_{\text{n}}T_{\text{C}}, is calculated to be 1.37, which is almost the same as that predicted by BCS theory (1.43) [42].

The anomaly in the C/T-T curve has a shoulder at 1.76 K. A detailed investigation of the shoulder region is currently underway. However, it is possibly the result of multigap superconductivity or spatial inhomogeneity in the chemical composition of the samples.

Figure 6(a) is a magnetic field-temperature phase diagram deduced from the measurements of electrical resistivity, ac magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat. The empty triangles, circles, and rhombus represent T_{\text{C}}^{\text{-con}}, T_{\text{C}}^{\text{-mid}}, and T_{\text{C}}^{\text{-con}}app shown in Fig. 3(b). The solid squares represent H_{\text{C}}^{\text{-mid}}, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4. The solid triangles represent the superconducting critical temperature T_{\text{C}}^{\text{SH}} determined from the specific-heat data using the entropy-conserving construction.

Figure 6(b) shows the reduced magnetic field h^{\ast} as a function of the reduced temperature t^{\ast}, where h^{\ast}\!=\!H/(-dH/dT)T_{\text{C}} and t^{\ast}\!=\!T/T_{\text{C}}. The dashed-dotted dotted lines show h^{\ast} calculated using the pair-breaking model proposed by Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenber (WHH), in the clean and dirty limits [43, 44, 45], respectively. The h^{\ast}-t^{\ast} curve obtained from the resistivity data agrees with those obtained from the ac magnetic susceptibility and specific-heat data. The t^{\ast} dependence of h^{\ast} deviates from the calculated curve. The value of H_{\text{C}}^{\text{-2}} (0) was therefore determined to be 0.27 T from \mu_{0}H_{\text{C}}^{\text{-2-con}}. This value is approximately one-tenth of the Pauli limiting field \mu_{0}H_{\text{p}} (3.31 T), defined as

Figure 6: (Color online) (a) Magnetic field-temperature phase diagram deduced from measurements of electrical resistivity, ac magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat. The empty triangles, circles, and rhombus indicate T_{\text{C}}^{\text{-con}}, T_{\text{C}}^{\text{-2-mid}}, and T_{\text{C}}^{\text{-2-con}}app, shown in Fig. 3(b). The solid squares and triangles represent H_{\text{C}} determined from \gamma^{\prime}, and T_{\text{C}} determined from the specific-heat data, respectively. (b) Reduced magnetic field h^{\ast} as a function of reduced temperature t^{\ast}, where h^{\ast}\!=\!H/(-dH/dT)T_{\text{C}} and t^{\ast}\!=\!T/T_{\text{C}}. The dashed-dotted and dotted lines show h^{\ast} calculated using a pair-breaking model in the clean and dirty limits, respectively.

  H_{\rm p}=18.4T_{\rm C} (kOe) [46, 47], which indicates the absence of Pauli limiting in BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherent length \xi (0) was determined to be 35 nm using the formula H_{\rm C2}(0)=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi(0)^{2}, where \Phi_{0} is the flux quantum [42].

As described above, the t^{*} dependence of h^{*} deviates from the calculated curve based on the pair-breaking model proposed by WHH, assuming that the superconductor has a single superconducting gap. A similar deviation has been observed for iron pnictides such as LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x}[48], Co-doped SrFe_{2}As_{2}[49], and Co-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}[50], and was interpreted within the framework of a two-gap model. A theory for two-gap superconductors indicated that the T-H_{\rm C2} (T) curve can differ from that predicted by single-gap theory, and that H_{\rm C2} (0) can considerably exceed the value determined based on the one-gap model in the dirty limit, 0.7T_{\rm C}d\,H_{\rm C2}/dT_{\rm C}[51]. In the case of MgB_{2}, two superconducting gaps are formed as a result of a 2D cylindrical FS and a 3D tubular-network FS [31, 32]. BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} has four FS sheets with different dimensionality and carrier type. Two are 2D electronlike FSs and two are 3D holelike FSs, as later calculations will show. Therefore, these FSs are expected to form multiple superconducting gaps in BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}, as in the case of MgB_{2}. Therefore, the observed deviation in the t^{*}-h^{*} curve might be due to such multigap superconductivity. Further study using single-crystalline samples is necessary in order to confirm whether the presence of multiple gaps plays an important role in the superconductivity of BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}.

### Electronic structure

Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the band structure and the total and partial density of states (DOS) for BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}. The bands in the energy range from -0.2 to 0.0 Ry mainly consists of Sb s-states. The bands in the energy range from 0.1 to 0.7 Ry mainly consist of Sb p and Pt d states. Above 0.7 Ry, the bands originate from the Ba d and Pt d states. Since the bands associated with Pt and Sb are broad, the correlation is deduced to be weak in BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}. Four bands cross the Fermi level E_{\rm F}, as can be seen clearly on the \Gamma-Y line. N(E_{\rm F}) is 29.8 states/Ry/chemical formula unit, or 2.58 states/eV/chemical formula unit. Figure 8(b) shows an expanded view of the partial DOS near E_{\rm F}. N(E_{\rm F}) mainly consists of Sb p and Pt d states, and the contribution from the Pt d states is larger, particularly for Pt1 atoms (Pt atoms at 4g site in Table 1). The contributions of the Pt2\,d, Sb2\,p, and Sb1\,p states are approximately one half, one third, and one fifth of that of the Pt1 d states, respectively. It is worth noting that the Pt1 atoms are in PtSb_{4} tetrahedra in the Pt_{2}Sb_{2} layers. These results suggest that carrier conduction mainly occurs in these layers.

The four bands that cross E_{\rm F} on the \Gamma-Y line from the \Gamma to Y points are the 37th, 38th, 39th, and 40th bands from the bottom, respectively, which results in four FS sheets, as illustrated in Fig. 9. The sheets formed by the 37th and 38th bands are holelike, whereas the other two are electronlike. The 37th and 38th bands form 3D FSs around the \Gamma point. The 39th and 40th bands form 2D FSs with a cylindrical shape along the k_{x} direction at the corners near the M point.

The shape of the FSs in BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is similar to that observed in BaPd_{2}Sb_{2}[29] and SrPt_{2}As_{2}[22] in that there are two 3D FSs and two 2D FSs. However, the carrier types are different. SrPt_{2}As_{2} has one holelike FS and three electronlike FSs, whereas BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} has two holelike FSs and two electronlike FSs, as in the case of BaPd_{2}Sb_{2}.

The anisotropic shape of the FSs is expected to be reflected in anisotropic transport properties. To investigate this, the Fermi velocity components v_{\rm F}^{\rm x} and v_{\rm F}^{\rm z} were calculated

Figure 7: Band structure of BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}.

  assuming the angle \beta_{\rm ac} in the unit cell to be 90^{\circ} because the first two digits in the Fermi velocities are the same for crystal structures with \beta_{\rm ac} values of 90^{\circ} and 91.227^{\circ}. Table 3 lists the average values of v_{\rm F}^{x} and v_{\rm F}^{z}, and the ratio v_{\rm F}^{x}/v_{\rm F}^{z} for BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} together with the two polymorphs BaPd_{2}Sb_{2} and SrPt_{2}As_{2}. The v_{\rm F}^{z}/v_{\rm F}^{z} values are clearly greater than unity for BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} and the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type materials, which suggests that these materials have anisotropic transport properties. On the other hand, those for the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type materials are close to unity, suggesting isotropic transport properties. Thus, the existence of 2D FSs in BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} and the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type materials is reflected in anisotropic transport properties.

Table 4 lists T_{\rm C}, \gamma_{\rm a}, \theta_{\rm D}, N(E_{\rm F}), and the electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda for BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}, SrPt_{2}Sb_{2}[32], LaPd_{2}Sb_{2}[52], and SrPt_{2}As_{2}[20, 22]. LaPd_{2}Sb_{2} is a recently reported superconducting material (T_{\rm C} = 1.4 K) with the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure. \gamma_{\rm a}^{\rm ext} is \gamma_{\rm a} obtained from specific-heat measurements and \gamma_{\rm a}^{\rm calc} is \gamma_{\rm a} calculated using the equation \gamma_{\rm a}^{\rm calc} = (\pi^{2}/3)N(E_{F})k_{B}^{2}.\lambda was estimated to be 0.67 for BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} using the relation \gamma_{\rm a}^{\rm expt} = (1 + \lambda)_{\rm f}^{\rm calc}. BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is a superconducting material with moderate coupling. The value of \gamma_{\rm a}^{\rm expt} for BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is comparable to those for SrPt_{2}Sb_{2} and SrPt_{2}Sb_{2}, and is slightly larger than that for LaPd_{2}Sb_{2}. \theta_{\rm D} for BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is the smallest among the four compounds. The value of \lambda is comparable to that for SrPt_{2}As_{2}.

## IV Conclusion

This study clearly demonstrated that the 122-type antimonide, BaPt_{2}Sb_{2}, which is structurally related to the iron-based superconductors, shows superconductivity with a T_{\rm C} of 1.8 K. BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} crystallizes in a new monoclinic variant of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure. Calculations showed that it has two 3D FSs and two 2D FSs, which results in anisotropic transport properties. The d states of Pt atoms in PbSb_{4} tetrahedra in the Pt_{2}Sb_{2} layers make the main contribution to N(E_{\rm F}). A comparison between experimental and calculation results indicated that BaPt_{2}Sb_{2} is a superconducting material with moderate coupling.

This study also demonstrated that unknown variants of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure may exist in 122-type pnictides. It is therefore worthwhile to search for superconducting 122 antimonides with a CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure or variant since this can lead to the discovery of new superconducting materials. Since the calculated electronic structure for CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type iron-free pnictides indicates that they have characteristics intermediate between those for ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type iron and iron-free pnictides, this will also aid in forming a systematic understanding of superconductivity in 122 pnictides.
