###### Abstract

Superconductivity at 33 K in Sr2VO3FeAs is completely suppressed by
small amounts of V doping in Sr2VO3(Fe4.03(c:0.01)V0.07(c:0.01))As. The
crystal structures and exact stoichiometries are determined by combined
neutron powder diffraction and x-ray powder diffraction. Sr2VO3FeAs is
shown to be very sensitive to Fe/V mixing, which interferes with or even
suppresses superconductivity. This inhomogeneity may be intrinsic and
explains scattered reports regarding T_(c) and reduced superconducting
phase fractions in Sr2VO3FeAs. Neutron-diffraction data collected at 4 K
indicate incommensurate magnetic ordering of the V sublattice with a
propagation vector **q** (0, 0.0, 0.306). This suggests strongly
correlated vanadium, which does not contribute significantly to the
Fermi surface of Sr2VO3FeAs.

The discovery of iron pnictide superconductors[1; 2; 3] has opened a new
chapter in superconductor research. Enormous progress has already been
made with respect to the physics of these materials and it becomes
increasingly accepted that the weak magnetism inside the iron layers
plays a decisive role in superconductivity,[4] even though the specific
relationship to the pairing mechanism is still unclear. This weak
magnetism appears as a spin-density wave (SDW) in all iron-based
materials with simple PbFCl- (Refs. [5] and [6]) and TbCr2Si2-related
structures[7] and is intimately connected with nesting of
cylinder-shaped Fermi surfaces by a wave vector **q** = (_p_, _m_).[8]
However, no SDW of that or similar kind has been observed in the more
complex arsenides Sr2_M_O3FeAs (_M_ = Sc, Cr, V) (Refs. [9; 10; 11])
where the isoelectronic (FeAs)1- layers are separated by larger
perovskitelielike (Sr2_M_O3)1+ blocks. Among them, only the V compound
Sr2VO3FeAs is superconducting up to 37 K (Ref. [11]) and it has been
controversially argued whether in this case the V atoms significantly
contribute to the Fermi surface[12] or not.[13] If this is not the case,
the topology of the Fermi surface turns out to have the same essential
features as in the other FeAs superconductors, otherwise one has to
assume another mechanism in the case of Sr2VO3FeAs. The latter seems to
be improbable with respect to the T_(c), which is strikingly similar to
other iron arsenide superconductors.

If we assume for the moment that the superconducting mechanism in
Sr2VO3FeAs is the same as in the other iron arsenides, the absence of
any SDW anomaly may suggest that the FeAs layer is intrinsically doped.
Vanadium can easily adopt oxidation states between V1+ and V4+ and would
thus be able to supply or to accept electrons from the FeAs layers.
Indeed, a recent x-ray absorption study indicates the presence of V3+
and V4+ in a Sr2VO3FeAs sample.[14] But even in this case, it remains
confusing that also Sr2ScO3FeAs, where the scandium valence is fixed to
Sc3+, shows neither a SDW nor any other magnetic effect.[9]

However, thorough investigations of Sr2VO3FeAs are hampered by the poor
quality of the samples, which always contain significant amounts of the
ternary vanadium oxides Sr2VO4 and/or Sr3VO2O3-_b_[11; 14; 15] However,
quantitative phase fractions are not specified by the authors. This
might be dangerous in the present case because these impurities contain
V4+ and exhibit at least weak paramagnetism.

Another fact that is hardly noticed so far concerns the true
stoichiometry and homogeneity of the Sr2_M_O3FeAs compounds. The ionic
radii of Fe2+, V2+/3+, and Cr3+ are similar and in face of synthesis
temperatures above 1000 degC, their mixing is easily conceivable.
Indeed, we have recently found by neutron diffraction that the chromium
compound Sr2CrO3FeAs is not stoichiometric but intrinsically Cr doped in
the iron layer.[16] We suggest that this mixing probably poisons
superconductivity. Such mixing of iron and vanadium can also occur in
Sr2VO3FeAs and already small amounts of V in the Fe layer may seriously
affect the electronic and magnetic properties.

In order to shed some light on this puzzling material, we have optimized
the synthesis of Sr2VO3FeAs in order to minimize the amounts of impurity
phases, which allowed us to perform combined x-ray and neutron-powder
scattering investigations. In this Rapid Communication, we report on the
exact stoichiometry, magnetism, and superconductivity of differently
prepared Sr2VO3FeAs samples. We show that the superconducting phase is
almost ideally stoichiometric, whereas small V doping, which can easily
be achieved in the Fe layer, suppresses superconductivity. We present
susceptibility data and discuss hints to magnetic ordering of the V
sublattice from neutron-scattering data.

Sr2VO3FeAs was synthesized by heating mixtures of strontium, vanadium,
iron (III) oxide, and arsenic oxide in a molar ratio of 20:11:5:5. Two
separate batches of 1 g were prepared in alumina crucibles sealed in
silica ampoules under an atmosphere of purified argon. Each mixture was
heated to 1323 K at a rate of 60 K/h, kept at this temperature for 60 h
and cooled down to room temperature. The products were homogenized in an
agate mortar, pressed into pellets, and sintered at 1323 K for 60 h. The
latter step was performed twice. The batches were then united, reground,
pressed into pellets of 6 mm in diameter, and sintered together at 1323
K for 68 h. The obtained black crystalline product Sr2VO3FeAs is stable
in air. Sr2VO3(Fe0.93V0.09)As was synthesized by heating mixtures of
strontium, vanadium, iron (III) oxide, arsenic oxide, and vanadium (V)
oxide in a ratio of 100:54:20:25:3 in two separate batches accordingly.

program and the according parameters were allowed to refine freely.
Preferred orientations of the crystallites were described using March
Dollase or spherical harmonics functions. The Fe:V ratio at both the
iron and the vanadium site was determined by refining the occupancy of
the neutron and/or x-ray powder data, oxygen deficiency was ruled out by
refining the occupancy of all oxygen sites.

The crystallographic data of Sr2VO3FeAs and Sr2VO3(Fe0.93V0.07)As are
compiled in Table 1, the powder patterns and Rietveld fits are depicted
in Fig. 3. The amounts of impurity phases were determined by
quantitative Rietveld analysis. The undoped sample consists of
Sr2VO3FeAs (89.0 wt

The neutron-powder pattern of undoped, superconducting Sr₂VO₃FeAs at 4 K
shows weak additional peaks at the Q values 0.525, 1.49, and possibly
0.28 $\mathrm{\AA}^{-1}$, marked by arrows in Fig. 4. These can be
indexed as satellites of the (00ℓ) reflections according to Q₍₀₀₁₎+ΔQ,
Q₍₀₀₄₎−ΔQ, and Q₍₀₀₁₎−ΔQ with ΔQ≈ 0.123 $\mathrm{\AA}^{-1}$,
respectively. This suggests incommensurate, possibly helical magnetic
ordering along the c axis with a propagation vector q=(0, 0, 0, 306) in
reciprocal lattice units. Since low-temperature ⁵⁷Fe-Mossbauer data show
no signal splitting,[14] we expect ordering of the V sublattice. This
supports the idea of highly correlated vanadium in Sr₂VO₃FeAs, where
vanadium d states are removed from the Fermi level by the magnetic
exchange splitting. Recent angle-resolved photoemission experiments[19]
are in agreement with this model likewise. Even though our data strongly
suggest the existence magnetic ordering, we consider them as
preliminary. Further experiments in the low-Q region by polarization
analysis are required for a precise determination of the magnetic
structure and of the temperature dependence of the magnetic order
parameter.

In summary, we have shown that Sr₂VO₃FeAs is sensitive to Fe/V mixing in
the FeAs layer, which is detrimental to superconductivity. Small V
