###### Abstract

Both Ba_{24}Si_{100} and Ba_{24}Ge_{100} with crystallographically identical structure are found to be superconducting at 1.4 and 0.27 K, respectively. Physical properties of this superconductor Ba_{24}Si_{100} are studied by electric transport, specific heat capacity, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The density of states at the Fermi level N_{Eg}=0.148 states eV^{-1} (Si atom)^{-1} and a distinct jump of C_{p} at the superconducting transition temperature \Delta C_{p}=0.272 J K^{-1} mol^{-1} are obtained. An exponential fit of C_{p} below the superconducting states gives an energy gap 2\Delta=0.423 meV and shows that this is a superconductor having s-wave character or isotropic energy gap. On the basis of our experimental data other important physical parameters are also derived.

## I Introduction

Among a variety of clathrates so far reported, [1] the three types as shown in Fig. 1 have intensively been studied. The superconducting silicon network solid was discovered for Na_{2}Ba_{6}Si_{46} by Yamanaka's group in 1995, [2] where Na and Ba atoms are accommodated as endohedral elements inside the silicon polyhedra of Si_{20} and Si_{24} in the type I clathrates. Subsequently, a binary system Ba_{8}Si_{46} was successfully synthesized by the same group using high pressure syntheses. [3] Although the attempts to synthesize Ge_{46} compounds with the crystallographically identical structure have been made, no apparent such success has so far been reported. [4] In contrast to Si_{46} network system (type I clathrate), the superconductivity in the type III clathrates was found in Ba_{24}Ge_{100} (Ref. [5]) by the group from the MaxPlanck Institute at Dresden. [6] Although the superconducting transition temperature of T_{c} at 270 mK found in Ba_{24}Ge_{100} was very low, T_{c} rises up to 3.8 K by applying pressure. This is categorized to one that can be very unique like a certain group of high T_{c} copper oxide superconductors. Ba_{24}Si_{100} with the identical crystal structure to that of Ba_{24}Ge_{100} (Refs. [5] and [7]) was synthesized under high pressure, [8] but superconductivity was not reported at that time. However, our recent soft x-ray studies on Ba_{24}Si_{100} showed that the density of states at the Fermi level is sufficiently large and the superconductivity has been searched for a high quality sample.

In the present paper, we have shown that the both silicon and germanium clathrates of Ba_{24}V_{100} (IV=Si and Ge) with

Figure 1: (Color online) Three types of clathrates classified from type I to III. The type I consists of IV_{20} dodecahedra and IV_{24}, tetrakaidecahedra and the type II consists of IV_{20} and IV_{28} hexa-kaidecahedra. The type III contains closed IV_{20} with helical geometry, pseudocubic cases and open cages. The three kinds of cages are also shown using a ball and stick model.

  identical crystal structure are superconductors. Because this a situation that superconductivity occurs both in the Si and Ge polyhedral network solids with crystallographically identical structure after the discovery of superconductivity for these families in 1995, the direct comparison on the fundamental physical parameters between these two superconductors shall give many important insights into the mechanism of superconductivity.[9, 10, 11]

We will exemplify that many physical properties are very much differentiated between Si and Ge polyhedral network solids even if their crystal structures are identical. Especially, it will be highlighted that T_{c} changes toward a reverse direction between Ba_{24}Si_{100} and Ba_{24}Ge_{100} upon high pressure. We will discuss the physical properties using the experimental data obtained from specific heat capacity C_{p} and magnetic susceptibility \chi measurements. The evolution of C_{p} and \chi as a function of temperature unambiguously shows that the system can be featured by a large electron-phonon coupling parameter.

## II Experiment

Ba_{24}Si_{100} was synthesized under high pressure according to the previous method.[8] It is noted that to improve the quality, precise control of both temperature and pressure was needed. Otherwise, superconducting Ba_{8}Si_{46} and BaSi_{2} were also produced as contaminants. To obtain x-ray powder diffraction data of good counting statistics with high angular resolution, measurements were carried out at the SPring-8 BL02B2 beam line.[12] For specific heat capacity measurements PPMS (Quantum Design), with a ^{3}He dilution cryo-generator and a heat capacity cell, was used. The ingot Ba_{24}Si_{100} sample weighted by 2.7 mg was put on a platform with four straight wires to measure C_{p}. In order to figure out the rattling motion, the same measurements were repeated three times at low temperatures below 20 K. Magnetic susceptibilities were measured by a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) (Quantum Design MPMS7) system. Ba_{24}Si_{100} generally of 7.0 mg was wrapped by a thin plastic film for measurements. Magnetic susceptibilities of the conduction electrons were obtained by subtracting the magnetic moment values measured under 4 T from those under 6 T with a correction of the temperature dependent Curie term.

## III Results and Discussion

### Electric transport

The four-probe transport measurement using a ^{3}He cryostat system showed that Ba_{24}Si_{100} enters into a superconducting state at 1.4 K as shown in Fig. 2. No electronic phase transitions were observed until the superconductivity occurs, being different from that of Ba_{24}Ge_{100} where a large resistivity upturn is reported at 200 K.[13] The resistivity at room temperature reduces to one fifth with decreasing temperature. It is very important to emphasize that superconductivity occurs both in Si and Ge networks with the identical crystal structure, like diamond Si and Ge, and this is such an example.

We have employed ac susceptibility experiments on this sample in order to confirm whether the observed superconductivity is bulk superconductivity as shown in the inset of Fig. 2. The volume of Ba_{24}Si_{100} was estimated to be 1.44 mm^{3} using the lattice parameter of a_{0}=1.407 nm obtained from x-ray analyses. Although the absolute quantitative analyses need the diamagnetic corrections, the ac susceptibilities calibrated by In (0.73 mm^{3}) and Sn (0.49 mm^{3}) as internal standards indicates that Ba_{24}Si_{100} is a real bulk superconductor.

It is reported that the T_{c} observed in Ba_{24}Ge_{100} at \sim270 mK was eventually elevated until 3.8 K by applying pressure of 2.7 GPa.[6] which is generally very unusual in the conventional superconductors. Therefore, we have repeated the experiments. As shown in Fig. 3 (right), the T_{c} actually rises to 3.2 K under 1.5 GPa. We have also examined how the T_{c} of Ba_{24}Si_{100} changes upon pressure until 1.15 GPa and found that, in contrast to the situation encountered for Ba_{24}Ge_{100}, the T_{c} decreases a little as shown in Fig. 3 (left). No structural change has been confirmed in Ba_{24}Si_{100} by x-ray diffraction studies under high pressure up to 3 GPa and this is also consistent with the recent high pressure Raman studies.[14]

The temperature dependence of the resistivity was not perfectly linear, and small deformation was observed. Since the lattice parameter of the network does not significantly change, such deformation will not be due to the change in the polyhedral framework. The rattling motion of Ba atoms inside the cluster cages may be related to this phenomenon. Actually, as reported in the crystallographically identical Ba_{24}Ge_{100} with a larger accommodation space inside the cluster cage, resistivity drastically changes at 200 K from

Figure 2: dc resistivity and ac susceptibility (inset) of Ba_{24}Si_{100}. The observed values of the ac susceptibilities depend on the geometry of samples and are generally expressed by \chi_{obs}=-(1/4\pi) \times{1/(1-(N/4\pi))}, where N is the geometry factor. The shape of Sn was spherical (N=4\pi/3) while that of Ba_{24}Si_{100} and In was spheroidal like. Considering the geometrical correction for such shapes of the measured samples gave almost 100% superconducting fraction.

  a high metallic state to a low metallic one.[13] It should be noted that the resistivity at 300 K of Ba_{24}Si_{100} is 50 m\Omega cm and this is larger by 50 times than 1 m\Omega cm of Ba_{24}Ge_{100} at 300 K.

### Magnetic susceptibilities

The magnetic susceptibility of Ba_{24}Si_{100}, measured under high magnetic fields using SQUID, was nearly temperature independent and indicates Pauli magnetism. The isolated spin number giving the Curie term appearing at low temperatures was estimated to be 0.063 spins (Si_{100})^{-1} (in the present case, per lattice) and was apparently ascribed to the defects in the crystal. The temperature evolutions of the magnetic susceptibilities after the correction of Curie terms are shown in Fig. 4. The temperature-independent value \chi_{cant} was -1.54\pm 0.12\times 10^{-3} emu (Si_{100} mol)^{-1} considering the scattering error of the present data. In the same figure, \chi_{cant} of Ba_{24}Ge_{100} is also displayed at low temperatures and high temperatures straddling the electronic phase transition at 200 K. For extracting the intrinsic Pauli magnetic terms from these data, core diamagnetic susceptibilities were calculated using the values in the literature: -24\times 10^{-6} for Ba^{2+}, -3.1\times 10^{-6} for Si, and -7.7\times 10^{-6} emu mol^{-1} for Ge, giving \chi_{core} values of -0.888\times 10^{-3} for Ba_{24}Si_{100} and -1.35\times 10^{-3} emu mol^{-1} for Ba_{24}Ge_{100}.

Although the concept of diamagnetic susceptibilities produced from the ring current \chi_{ring} in the polyhedral cluster solids has not fully been established, such corrections are known to be needed.[4] Using the modified Pauling's formula for handling the Larmor diamagnetic susceptibility, \chi_{ring} = [2N_{a}e^{2}/(6mc^{2})](r^{2}) emu mol^{-1},[15]\chi_{ring} is evaluated to be -3.28\times 10^{-3} for Ba_{24}Si_{100} and -3.59\times 10^{-3}emu mol^{-1} for Ba_{24}Ge_{100}. In the formula, Z denotes the number of electrons involved in the cyclic ring current formation, N_{A} is Avogadro's number, e is the Coulomb charge of an electron, m is the mass of an electron, and c is the speed of light. We used the number of elements constructing polyhedral IV_{20} in the Bravais lattice as Z. These corrections gave the \chi_{Pauli} values to be 2.63\times 10^{-3} for Ba_{24}Si_{100} as well as 2.79 \times 10^{-3} for high-T and 2.10\times 10^{-3}emu mol^{-1} for low-T phases of Ba_{24}Ge_{100}.

Another method of estimation for \chi_{Pauli} has been made. Knowing that the ratio of N_{E_{F}} values in high-T phase to that in low-T phase of Ba_{24}Ge_{100}, achieved from soft x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),[16] the \chi_{Pauli} values can be directly extracted. We have studied the electronic states in the vicinity at the Fermi level using XPS at a high energy radiation facility. As shown in Fig. 5, the density of states at the Fermi level N_{E_{F}} of Ba_{24}Ge_{100} measured at 300 K reduced at 20 K to a very low value. The change in N_{E_{F}} observed at 20 K is due to the electronic phase transition, being consistent with the idea of the rattling motion of the endohedral Ba atoms.[6] These situations are consistent with maximum entropy method (MEM) analyses described later in the present paper.

By optimizing the value of \chi_{dia} as an off-set parameter so that the N_{E_{F}} observed by XPS can be explained, the

  \chi_{Pauli}=\chi_{const}-\chi_{dia} can be evaluated. This method gives more reliable experimental diamagnetic susceptibility \chi_{dia} of Ba_{24}Ge_{100} to be -3.11\times 10^{-3} emu mol^{-1}. When the value of Ba_{24}Ge_{100} is scaled to that of Ba_{24}Si_{100} using the ratio in \chi_{ring} described earlier, \chi_{dia} of Ba_{24}Si_{100} is estimated to be -2.50\times 10^{-3} emu mol^{-1}. As a result, the \chi_{Pauli} values can be obtained to be 9.59\times 10^{-6} emu (Si mol^{-1}) for Ba_{24}Si_{100}, 9.65\times 10^{-6} emu (Ge mol^{-1}) for the high-T phase, and 2.75\times 10^{-6} emu (Ge mol^{-1}) for the low-T phase of Ba_{24}Ge_{100}. From the relationship \chi_{Pauli}=2\mu_{B}^{2}N_{E_{F}}, the N_{E_{F}} values are determined to be 0.148 states eV^{-1} (Si atom)^{-1} for Ba_{24}Si_{100}, 0.149 states eV^{-1} (Ge atom)^{-1} for the high-T phase, and 0.0427 states eV^{-1} (Ge atom)^{-1} for the low-T phase of Ba_{24}Ge_{100}.

There are three kinds of Ba atoms in Ba_{24}_IV_{100}_ (_IV_=Si and Ge) from the crystallographical viewpoint as is seen in Fig. 1. In order to see the differences in the rattling motion of Ba between Ba_{24}Si_{100} and Ba_{24}Ge_{100}, a MEM/Rietveld method [17] has been performed. The MEM analysis was carried out with a program ENIGMA [18]. Figure 6 showed the equi-charge-density surfaces of these three kinds of Ba atoms at 80 K. Immediately we can recognize that the Ba(3) accommodated in the open cage structure rattles in a very anisotropic fashion, while Ba(1) and Ba(2) atoms do isotropically in the case of the Ge_{100} network. When similar analyses were adopted to the Si_{100} network, such anisotropic electron distributions were not observed even at 80 K. The Ba(3) atoms showing large thermal vibrations at high temperatures will eventually move to a specific trapping site and the equi-charge-density surface will statically become very anisotropic. The reason that such motion was not observed, even in the Ba(3) position in the case of Ba_{24}Si_{100}, is not apparent at the present stage. It is, however, conceivable that the hybridization of Ba 5d and 6s orbitals and the 3d orbitals of the Ge polyhedra may play an important role in controlling such a rattling motion other than a larger space in the Ge_{100} network than that in Si_{100} one.

### Specific heat capacity

Specific heat capacity C_{p} of Ba_{24}Si_{100} is shown in Fig. 7. The specific heat jump at T_{c}=1.4 K corresponds to the superconducting phase transition observed in electric transport. The evolution of C_{p} as a function of temperature under the superconducting state can be fitted well using an exponential function of C_{p}\simexp[-\Delta/k_{B}T] better than T^{\alpha} function as shown in Fig. 7. This indicates that the superconductivity can be categorized as an s-wave superconductor or a superconductor having an isotropic energy gap. The superconducting energy gap can be estimated to be 2\Delta=0.423 meV. It is noted here that the C_{p} data below 8 K scatters to a small extent. Considering the fact that C_{p} greatly changes at 200 K in Ba_{24}Ge_{100} due to the influences of the Ba rattling in the open cage structure [13], this phenomenon will be most likely due to the rattled Ba atoms. Although we do not have any exact explanations on this unconventional feature, this was gradually suppressed while the temperature scans were repeated. Therefore, nevertheless of the C_{p} fluctuations, the Sommerfeld parameter \gamma was able to be estimated as 0.182 J K^{-2} mol^{-1}, from the C_{p} by applying a standard method of the C_{p}/T vs T^{2} relationship. When \DeltaC_{p}/\gammaT_{c} =1.43 derived in the weak coupling BCS regime is applied, the \gamma value was determined to be 0.136 J K^{-2} mol^{-1} as another estimation of \gamma. These \gamma values in turn give N_{E_{F}} to be 0.386 and 0.288 states eV^{-1} (Si atom)^{-1}, respectively.

Owing to the rattling phonons existing at low temperatures, Debye \Theta_{D} and Einstein \Theta_{E} terms may not be obtained with good accuracy directly from the experimental data. Therefore, the \Theta_{D} value was empirically estimated using the \Theta_{D} and \Theta_{E} values of Ba_{24}Ge_{100}. For this purpose, the following equation can be applied:

\[\Theta_{D}(\mathrm{Ba}_{24}Si_{100})\sim [a_{0}(Ba_{24}Ge_{100})/a_{0}(Ba_{24}Si_{100})]\] \[\times [v(\mathit{diamond}\ \mathit{Si})/v(\mathit{diamond}\ \mathit{Ge})]\] \[\times \Theta_{D}(\mathrm{Ba}_{24}Ge_{100}),\]

where v is the sound velocity. Because the Ba rattling occurs

  at a relatively high temperature of 200 K, hence, it will give little influence on the analyses. From this equation Th_D_ =411 K was estimated for Ba24Si100 when _v_(_diamond_ Si) =5.88 x 103 m s-1, _v_(_diamond_ Ge) =3.55 x 103 m s-1 and Th_D_p_=240 K for Ba24Ge100 (Ref. [13]) were used. The Einstein Th_E_ term was also been empirically scaled by the lattice parameters a0 between Ba24Si100 and Ba24Ge100. The correlation between Th_E_ values and lattice parameters can be seen for skutterudite and pyrochlore compounds.[19] When the Th_E_ values of 44 and 104 K of Ba24Ge100 were employed,[13] th_E_=46 and 108 K were obtained using Th_E_(Ba24Si100) =[_a_0(Ba24Ge100)/_a_0(Ba24Si100)] x _th_E_(Ba24Ge100).

Another estimate for the Debye Th_D_ and the Einstein Th_E_ values could also be possible using the phonon frequency o data using Th_D_,_E_(Ba24Si100) =[_a_0(Ba24Si100)/_a_0(Ba24Ge100)] x _th_D_,_E_(Ba24Ge100). In order to evaluate the o values, Raman spectra have been measured and are shown in Fig. 8. Considering the frequency shift observed between 520 cm-1 for 28Si and 300 cm-1 for 74Ge, the observed shift of 395 cm-1 for Ba24Si100 and 235 cm-1 for Ba24Ge100 can be assigned to the vibrational frequencies of the polyhedral networks. The modes having frequencies below 200 cm-1 observed simultaneously both for Ba24Si100 and Ba24Ge100 may be assigned to the Ba modes, but the assignment is very much uncertain at the moment. The frequencies with a less shift ranging from 200 to 300 cm-1 will be ascribed to the Si-Ba and the Ge-Ba vibrational modes. These data are consistent with the recent report.[13] Using the frequencies of 395 and 235 cm-1 together with Th_D_p_=240 K of Ba24Ge100,[6, 13] Th_D_ of Ba24Si100 was estimated to be 403 K. This is in fairly good agreement with the value estimated using the sound velocity. Due to the experimental inaccuracy in the vibrational modes of the endohedral Ba, Th_E_ values were not estimated in the present study.

The Debye and Einstein temperature parameters and the g estimated earlier from D_C_p_ can satisfactorily explain the experimental _C_p_ data of Ba24Si100, although the influences of the Ba rattling phonons still may scatter the observation for the data.

### Superconducting parameters of Ba24Si100

In the concept of the Zintl phase[20] for (Ba2+)24([3_b_]Ge1+)32([4_b_]Ge06)68(16_e_-),[13] 16 electrons per Bravais lattice will be considered. Using the lattice constant of 1.407 nm for Ba24Si100, the electron carrier concentration is 5.75 x 1021 cm-3. This is roughly consistent with the carrier concentration n of 2.60 x 1021 cm-3 obtained by measurements of the Seebeck coefficient. Applying a three-dimensional electron model to Ba24Si100 supposing the carrier concentration of 2.60 x 1021 cm-3, Fermi wave number k_{F} of 4.25 x 107 cm-1 is obtained. Using the equations of _kh__F_n_n_=2_k__B__B__T_n_/(2 2 2 2 2 2)] k_{F} and _g_=[_k__B__T_n_/(3 2 2 2)] k_{F}, _kh__F__n_/ and _g__n_calc_ can be estimated to be 5.09 x 10-4 emu mol-1 and 0.0371 J K-2 mol-1. Although the Ba rattling influences on the specific heat capacity as is pointed out earlier, it is indeed meaningful to have a large enhancement in the experimental g value ranging from 0.136 to 0.182 J K-2 mol-1. Actually, the Wilson factor _k__W_=( p2_k__B__T_n_/2 2)(_kh__F_n_/ _g_), calculated from the experimental _kh__F_n_/ and g_{n}, is from 0.38 to 0.51 and significantly small. This fact indicates that the system is controlled greatly by electron-phonon interactions rather than electron-electron ones.

In order to explain the T_{c} of 1.4 K using the McMillan equation, \begin{equation*}T_{c}=[({\Theta}_{D})/1.45]{\mathrm{exp}}[-[1.04(1+\lambda)]/[ \lambda-\mu^{*}(1+0.62\lambda)]\lambda,{\mathrm{=}}0.399\end{equation*} is needed for Th_D_p_=411 K if one can suppose _m_' = 0.1 (the general value of _m_' ranges from 0.1 to 0.2). Here k =_N__E__F__V_, V is the electron-phonon coupling parameter, and _m_' is the electron-electron repulsive screening parameter to the Cooper pairing attractive force. If this is the case, a large electron-phonon coupling strength must be constrained in this system considering that the _N__E__F_ is small.

From the evolution of specific heat as a function of magnetic field, [_d__t__c_2/ _d__T_] can be estimated as a linear plot of _H__c_2 vs T_{c}. Using the WHH equation of 0.69 x [_d__t__c_2/ _d__T_] =_g_T__c_, the upper critical field of _H__c_2(_T_ =0) was extrapolated to be 0.24 T. This leads to a Ginzburg-Landau coherence length x to be 372 A using _g_=[{{\Phi}_{0}/[2\pi H_{c}(2T{\mathrm{=}}0)]}] 1/2. The mean free path t of conduction electrons can be estimated to be 0.67 A using _t_=_mv__F_/(_n_e_2). Here the resistivity r = 10 mJ cm and Fermi velocity _v__F_=_h__k__F_/_m_ of 4.92 x 107 cm s-1 were employed, and k_{F} for the carrier concentration was estimated by the Seebeck coefficient. This concludes that Ba24Si100 is a superconductor classified as a dirty limit of t  x.

## IV Conclusion

Ba24Si100 was reported to superconduct like Ba24Ge100. Physical parameters were obtained for the Ba24Si100 superconductor from resistivity, specific heat capacity, and ac and dc magnetic susceptibility measurements. The physical parameters derived by these experiments implied that this system can be featured by the extremely strong electron-phonon coupling strength and is a superconductor in the dirty limit. The endohedral Ba atom rattling motion seems to be closely associated with this strong _e_-ph coupling parameter from the experimental viewpoint and this may open a route for searching exotic materials in the future.

###### Abstract

Both Ba_{24}Si_{100} and Ba_{24}Ge_{100} with crystallographically identical structure are found to be superconducting at 1.4 and 0.27 K, respectively. Physical properties of this superconductor Ba_{24}Si_{100} are studied by electric transport, specific heat capacity, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The density of states at the Fermi level N_{Eg}=0.148 states eV^{-1} (Si atom)^{-1} and a distinct jump of C_{p} at the superconducting transition temperature \Delta C_{p}=0.272 J K^{-1} mol^{-1} are obtained. An exponential fit of C_{p} below the superconducting states gives an energy gap 2\Delta=0.423 meV and shows that this is a superconductor having s-wave character or isotropic energy gap. On the basis of our experimental data other important physical parameters are also derived.

## I Introduction

Among a variety of clathrates so far reported, [1] the three types as shown in Fig. 1 have intensively been studied. The superconducting silicon network solid was discovered for Na_{2}Ba_{6}Si_{46} by Yamanaka's group in 1995, [2] where Na and Ba atoms are accommodated as endohedral elements inside the silicon polyhedra of Si_{20} and Si_{24} in the type I clathrates. Subsequently, a binary system Ba_{8}Si_{46} was successfully synthesized by the same group using high pressure syntheses. [3] Although the attempts to synthesize Ge_{46} compounds with the crystallographically identical structure have been made, no apparent such success has so far been reported. [4] In contrast to Si_{46} network system (type I clathrate), the superconductivity in the type III clathrates was found in Ba_{24}Ge_{100} (Ref. [5]) by the group from the MaxPlanck Institute at Dresden. [6] Although the superconducting transition temperature of T_{c} at 270 mK found in Ba_{24}Ge_{100} was very low, T_{c} rises up to 3.8 K by applying pressure. This is categorized to one that can be very unique like a certain group of high T_{c} copper oxide superconductors. Ba_{24}Si_{100} with the identical crystal structure to that of Ba_{24}Ge_{100} (Refs. [5] and [7]) was synthesized under high pressure, [8] but superconductivity was not reported at that time. However, our recent soft x-ray studies on Ba_{24}Si_{100} showed that the density of states at the Fermi level is sufficiently large and the superconductivity has been searched for a high quality sample.

In the present paper, we have shown that the both silicon and germanium clathrates of Ba_{24}V_{100} (IV=Si and Ge) with

Figure 1: (Color online) Three types of clathrates classified from type I to III. The type I consists of IV_{20} dodecahedra and IV_{24}, tetrakaidecahedra and the type II consists of IV_{20} and IV_{28} hexa-kaidecahedra. The type III contains closed IV_{20} with helical geometry, pseudocubic cases and open cages. The three kinds of cages are also shown using a ball and stick model.

  identical crystal structure are superconductors. Because this a situation that superconductivity occurs both in the Si and Ge polyhedral network solids with crystallographically identical structure after the discovery of superconductivity for these families in 1995, the direct comparison on the fundamental physical parameters between these two superconductors shall give many important insights into the mechanism of superconductivity.[9, 10, 11]

We will exemplify that many physical properties are very much differentiated between Si and Ge polyhedral network solids even if their crystal structures are identical. Especially, it will be highlighted that T_{c} changes toward a reverse direction between Ba_{24}Si_{100} and Ba_{24}Ge_{100} upon high pressure. We will discuss the physical properties using the experimental data obtained from specific heat capacity C_{p} and magnetic susceptibility \chi measurements. The evolution of C_{p} and \chi as a function of temperature unambiguously shows that the system can be featured by a large electron-phonon coupling parameter.

## II Experiment

Ba_{24}Si_{100} was synthesized under high pressure according to the previous method.[8] It is noted that to improve the quality, precise control of both temperature and pressure was needed. Otherwise, superconducting Ba_{8}Si_{46} and BaSi_{2} were also produced as contaminants. To obtain x-ray powder diffraction data of good counting statistics with high angular resolution, measurements were carried out at the SPring-8 BL02B2 beam line.[12] For specific heat capacity measurements PPMS (Quantum Design), with a ^{3}He dilution cryo-generator and a heat capacity cell, was used. The ingot Ba_{24}Si_{100} sample weighted by 2.7 mg was put on a platform with four straight wires to measure C_{p}. In order to figure out the rattling motion, the same measurements were repeated three times at low temperatures below 20 K. Magnetic susceptibilities were measured by a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) (Quantum Design MPMS7) system. Ba_{24}Si_{100} generally of 7.0 mg was wrapped by a thin plastic film for measurements. Magnetic susceptibilities of the conduction electrons were obtained by subtracting the magnetic moment values measured under 4 T from those under 6 T with a correction of the temperature dependent Curie term.

## III Results and Discussion

### Electric transport

The four-probe transport measurement using a ^{3}He cryostat system showed that Ba_{24}Si_{100} enters into a superconducting state at 1.4 K as shown in Fig. 2. No electronic phase transitions were observed until the superconductivity occurs, being different from that of Ba_{24}Ge_{100} where a large resistivity upturn is reported at 200 K.[13] The resistivity at room temperature reduces to one fifth with decreasing temperature. It is very important to emphasize that superconductivity occurs both in Si and Ge networks with the identical crystal structure, like diamond Si and Ge, and this is such an example.

We have employed ac susceptibility experiments on this sample in order to confirm whether the observed superconductivity is bulk superconductivity as shown in the inset of Fig. 2. The volume of Ba_{24}Si_{100} was estimated to be 1.44 mm^{3} using the lattice parameter of a_{0}=1.407 nm obtained from x-ray analyses. Although the absolute quantitative analyses need the diamagnetic corrections, the ac susceptibilities calibrated by In (0.73 mm^{3}) and Sn (0.49 mm^{3}) as internal standards indicates that Ba_{24}Si_{100} is a real bulk superconductor.

It is reported that the T_{c} observed in Ba_{24}Ge_{100} at \sim270 mK was eventually elevated until 3.8 K by applying pressure of 2.7 GPa.[6] which is generally very unusual in the conventional superconductors. Therefore, we have repeated the experiments. As shown in Fig. 3 (right), the T_{c} actually rises to 3.2 K under 1.5 GPa. We have also examined how the T_{c} of Ba_{24}Si_{100} changes upon pressure until 1.15 GPa and found that, in contrast to the situation encountered for Ba_{24}Ge_{100}, the T_{c} decreases a little as shown in Fig. 3 (left). No structural change has been confirmed in Ba_{24}Si_{100} by x-ray diffraction studies under high pressure up to 3 GPa and this is also consistent with the recent high pressure Raman studies.[14]

The temperature dependence of the resistivity was not perfectly linear, and small deformation was observed. Since the lattice parameter of the network does not significantly change, such deformation will not be due to the change in the polyhedral framework. The rattling motion of Ba atoms inside the cluster cages may be related to this phenomenon. Actually, as reported in the crystallographically identical Ba_{24}Ge_{100} with a larger accommodation space inside the cluster cage, resistivity drastically changes at 200 K from

Figure 2: dc resistivity and ac susceptibility (inset) of Ba_{24}Si_{100}. The observed values of the ac susceptibilities depend on the geometry of samples and are generally expressed by \chi_{obs}=-(1/4\pi) \times{1/(1-(N/4\pi))}, where N is the geometry factor. The shape of Sn was spherical (N=4\pi/3) while that of Ba_{24}Si_{100} and In was spheroidal like. Considering the geometrical correction for such shapes of the measured samples gave almost 100% superconducting fraction.

  a high metallic state to a low metallic one.[13] It should be noted that the resistivity at 300 K of Ba_{24}Si_{100} is 50 m\Omega cm and this is larger by 50 times than 1 m\Omega cm of Ba_{24}Ge_{100} at 300 K.

### Magnetic susceptibilities

The magnetic susceptibility of Ba_{24}Si_{100}, measured under high magnetic fields using SQUID, was nearly temperature independent and indicates Pauli magnetism. The isolated spin number giving the Curie term appearing at low temperatures was estimated to be 0.063 spins (Si_{100})^{-1} (in the present case, per lattice) and was apparently ascribed to the defects in the crystal. The temperature evolutions of the magnetic susceptibilities after the correction of Curie terms are shown in Fig. 4. The temperature-independent value \chi_{cant} was -1.54\pm 0.12\times 10^{-3} emu (Si_{100} mol)^{-1} considering the scattering error of the present data. In the same figure, \chi_{cant} of Ba_{24}Ge_{100} is also displayed at low temperatures and high temperatures straddling the electronic phase transition at 200 K. For extracting the intrinsic Pauli magnetic terms from these data, core diamagnetic susceptibilities were calculated using the values in the literature: -24\times 10^{-6} for Ba^{2+}, -3.1\times 10^{-6} for Si, and -7.7\times 10^{-6} emu mol^{-1} for Ge, giving \chi_{core} values of -0.888\times 10^{-3} for Ba_{24}Si_{100} and -1.35\times 10^{-3} emu mol^{-1} for Ba_{24}Ge_{100}.

Although the concept of diamagnetic susceptibilities produced from the ring current \chi_{ring} in the polyhedral cluster solids has not fully been established, such corrections are known to be needed.[4] Using the modified Pauling's formula for handling the Larmor diamagnetic susceptibility, \chi_{ring} = [2N_{a}e^{2}/(6mc^{2})](r^{2}) emu mol^{-1},[15]\chi_{ring} is evaluated to be -3.28\times 10^{-3} for Ba_{24}Si_{100} and -3.59\times 10^{-3}emu mol^{-1} for Ba_{24}Ge_{100}. In the formula, Z denotes the number of electrons involved in the cyclic ring current formation, N_{A} is Avogadro's number, e is the Coulomb charge of an electron, m is the mass of an electron, and c is the speed of light. We used the number of elements constructing polyhedral IV_{20} in the Bravais lattice as Z. These corrections gave the \chi_{Pauli} values to be 2.63\times 10^{-3} for Ba_{24}Si_{100} as well as 2.79 \times 10^{-3} for high-T and 2.10\times 10^{-3}emu mol^{-1} for low-T phases of Ba_{24}Ge_{100}.

Another method of estimation for \chi_{Pauli} has been made. Knowing that the ratio of N_{E_{F}} values in high-T phase to that in low-T phase of Ba_{24}Ge_{100}, achieved from soft x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),[16] the \chi_{Pauli} values can be directly extracted. We have studied the electronic states in the vicinity at the Fermi level using XPS at a high energy radiation facility. As shown in Fig. 5, the density of states at the Fermi level N_{E_{F}} of Ba_{24}Ge_{100} measured at 300 K reduced at 20 K to a very low value. The change in N_{E_{F}} observed at 20 K is due to the electronic phase transition, being consistent with the idea of the rattling motion of the endohedral Ba atoms.[6] These situations are consistent with maximum entropy method (MEM) analyses described later in the present paper.

By optimizing the value of \chi_{dia} as an off-set parameter so that the N_{E_{F}} observed by XPS can be explained, the

  \chi_{Pauli}=\chi_{const}-\chi_{dia} can be evaluated. This method gives more reliable experimental diamagnetic susceptibility \chi_{dia} of Ba_{24}Ge_{100} to be -3.11\times 10^{-3} emu mol^{-1}. When the value of Ba_{24}Ge_{100} is scaled to that of Ba_{24}Si_{100} using the ratio in \chi_{ring} described earlier, \chi_{dia} of Ba_{24}Si_{100} is estimated to be -2.50\times 10^{-3} emu mol^{-1}. As a result, the \chi_{Pauli} values can be obtained to be 9.59\times 10^{-6} emu (Si mol^{-1}) for Ba_{24}Si_{100}, 9.65\times 10^{-6} emu (Ge mol^{-1}) for the high-T phase, and 2.75\times 10^{-6} emu (Ge mol^{-1}) for the low-T phase of Ba_{24}Ge_{100}. From the relationship \chi_{Pauli}=2\mu_{B}^{2}N_{E_{F}}, the N_{E_{F}} values are determined to be 0.148 states eV^{-1} (Si atom)^{-1} for Ba_{24}Si_{100}, 0.149 states eV^{-1} (Ge atom)^{-1} for the high-T phase, and 0.0427 states eV^{-1} (Ge atom)^{-1} for the low-T phase of Ba_{24}Ge_{100}.

There are three kinds of Ba atoms in Ba_{24}_IV_{100}_ (_IV_=Si and Ge) from the crystallographical viewpoint as is seen in Fig. 1. In order to see the differences in the rattling motion of Ba between Ba_{24}Si_{100} and Ba_{24}Ge_{100}, a MEM/Rietveld method [17] has been performed. The MEM analysis was carried out with a program ENIGMA [18]. Figure 6 showed the equi-charge-density surfaces of these three kinds of Ba atoms at 80 K. Immediately we can recognize that the Ba(3) accommodated in the open cage structure rattles in a very anisotropic fashion, while Ba(1) and Ba(2) atoms do isotropically in the case of the Ge_{100} network. When similar analyses were adopted to the Si_{100} network, such anisotropic electron distributions were not observed even at 80 K. The Ba(3) atoms showing large thermal vibrations at high temperatures will eventually move to a specific trapping site and the equi-charge-density surface will statically become very anisotropic. The reason that such motion was not observed, even in the Ba(3) position in the case of Ba_{24}Si_{100}, is not apparent at the present stage. It is, however, conceivable that the hybridization of Ba 5d and 6s orbitals and the 3d orbitals of the Ge polyhedra may play an important role in controlling such a rattling motion other than a larger space in the Ge_{100} network than that in Si_{100} one.

### Specific heat capacity

Specific heat capacity C_{p} of Ba_{24}Si_{100} is shown in Fig. 7. The specific heat jump at T_{c}=1.4 K corresponds to the superconducting phase transition observed in electric transport. The evolution of C_{p} as a function of temperature under the superconducting state can be fitted well using an exponential function of C_{p}\simexp[-\Delta/k_{B}T] better than T^{\alpha} function as shown in Fig. 7. This indicates that the superconductivity can be categorized as an s-wave superconductor or a superconductor having an isotropic energy gap. The superconducting energy gap can be estimated to be 2\Delta=0.423 meV. It is noted here that the C_{p} data below 8 K scatters to a small extent. Considering the fact that C_{p} greatly changes at 200 K in Ba_{24}Ge_{100} due to the influences of the Ba rattling in the open cage structure [13], this phenomenon will be most likely due to the rattled Ba atoms. Although we do not have any exact explanations on this unconventional feature, this was gradually suppressed while the temperature scans were repeated. Therefore, nevertheless of the C_{p} fluctuations, the Sommerfeld parameter \gamma was able to be estimated as 0.182 J K^{-2} mol^{-1}, from the C_{p} by applying a standard method of the C_{p}/T vs T^{2} relationship. When \DeltaC_{p}/\gammaT_{c} =1.43 derived in the weak coupling BCS regime is applied, the \gamma value was determined to be 0.136 J K^{-2} mol^{-1} as another estimation of \gamma. These \gamma values in turn give N_{E_{F}} to be 0.386 and 0.288 states eV^{-1} (Si atom)^{-1}, respectively.

Owing to the rattling phonons existing at low temperatures, Debye \Theta_{D} and Einstein \Theta_{E} terms may not be obtained with good accuracy directly from the experimental data. Therefore, the \Theta_{D} value was empirically estimated using the \Theta_{D} and \Theta_{E} values of Ba_{24}Ge_{100}. For this purpose, the following equation can be applied:

\[\Theta_{D}(\mathrm{Ba}_{24}Si_{100})\sim [a_{0}(Ba_{24}Ge_{100})/a_{0}(Ba_{24}Si_{100})]\] \[\times [v(\mathit{diamond}\ \mathit{Si})/v(\mathit{diamond}\ \mathit{Ge})]\] \[\times \Theta_{D}(\mathrm{Ba}_{24}Ge_{100}),\]

where v is the sound velocity. Because the Ba rattling occurs

Figure 7: (Color online) Specific heat capacity C_{p} of Ba_{24}Si_{100}. The grey solid lines display fitting curves as explained in the text using \gamma=0.182 J K^{-2} mol^{-1}, \Theta_{D}=411 K, and \Theta_{E}=46 and 108 K.

  at a relatively high temperature of 200 K, hence, it will give little influence on the analyses. From this equation Th_D_ =411 K was estimated for Ba24Si100 when _v_(_diamond_ Si) =5.88 x 103 m s-1, _v_(_diamond_ Ge) =3.55 x 103 m s-1 and Th_D_p_=240 K for Ba24Ge100 (Ref. [13]) were used. The Einstein Th_E_ term was also been empirically scaled by the lattice parameters a0 between Ba24Si100 and Ba24Ge100. The correlation between Th_E_ values and lattice parameters can be seen for skutterudite and pyrochlore compounds.[19] When the Th_E_ values of 44 and 104 K of Ba24Ge100 were employed,[13] th_E_=46 and 108 K were obtained using Th_E_(Ba24Si100) =[_a_0(Ba24Ge100)/_a_0(Ba24Si100)] x _th_E_(Ba24Ge100).

Another estimate for the Debye Th_D_ and the Einstein Th_E_ values could also be possible using the phonon frequency o data using Th_D_,_E_(Ba24Si100) =[_a_0(Ba24Si100)/_a_0(Ba24Ge100)] x _th_D_,_E_(Ba24Ge100). In order to evaluate the o values, Raman spectra have been measured and are shown in Fig. 8. Considering the frequency shift observed between 520 cm-1 for 28Si and 300 cm-1 for 74Ge, the observed shift of 395 cm-1 for Ba24Si100 and 235 cm-1 for Ba24Ge100 can be assigned to the vibrational frequencies of the polyhedral networks. The modes having frequencies below 200 cm-1 observed simultaneously both for Ba24Si100 and Ba24Ge100 may be assigned to the Ba modes, but the assignment is very much uncertain at the moment. The frequencies with a less shift ranging from 200 to 300 cm-1 will be ascribed to the Si-Ba and the Ge-Ba vibrational modes. These data are consistent with the recent report.[13] Using the frequencies of 395 and 235 cm-1 together with Th_D_p_=240 K of Ba24Ge100,[6, 13] Th_D_ of Ba24Si100 was estimated to be 403 K. This is in fairly good agreement with the value estimated using the sound velocity. Due to the experimental inaccuracy in the vibrational modes of the endohedral Ba, Th_E_ values were not estimated in the present study.

The Debye and Einstein temperature parameters and the g estimated earlier from D_C_p_ can satisfactorily explain the experimental _C_p_ data of Ba24Si100, although the influences of the Ba rattling phonons still may scatter the observation for the data.

### Superconducting parameters of Ba24Si100

In the concept of the Zintl phase[20] for (Ba2+)24([3_b_]Ge1+)32([4_b_]Ge06)68(16_e_-),[13] 16 electrons per Bravais lattice will be considered. Using the lattice constant of 1.407 nm for Ba24Si100, the electron carrier concentration is 5.75 x 1021 cm-3. This is roughly consistent with the carrier concentration n of 2.60 x 1021 cm-3 obtained by measurements of the Seebeck coefficient. Applying a three-dimensional electron model to Ba24Si100 supposing the carrier concentration of 2.60 x 1021 cm-3, Fermi wave number k_{F} of 4.25 x 107 cm-1 is obtained. Using the equations of _kh__F_n_n_=2_k__B__B__T_n_/(2 2 2 2 2 2)] k_{F} and _g_=[_k__B__T_n_/(3 2 2 2)] k_{F}, _kh__F__n_/ and _g__n_calc_ can be estimated to be 5.09 x 10-4 emu mol-1 and 0.0371 J K-2 mol-1. Although the Ba rattling influences on the specific heat capacity as is pointed out earlier, it is indeed meaningful to have a large enhancement in the experimental g value ranging from 0.136 to 0.182 J K-2 mol-1. Actually, the Wilson factor _k__W_=( p2_k__B__T_n_/2 2)(_kh__F_n_/ _g_), calculated from the experimental _kh__F_n_/ and g_{n}, is from 0.38 to 0.51 and significantly small. This fact indicates that the system is controlled greatly by electron-phonon interactions rather than electron-electron ones.

In order to explain the T_{c} of 1.4 K using the McMillan equation, \begin{equation*}T_{c}=[({\Theta}_{D})/1.45]{\mathrm{exp}}[-[1.04(1+\lambda)]/[ \lambda-\mu^{*}(1+0.62\lambda)]\lambda,{\mathrm{=}}0.399\end{equation*} is needed for Th_D_p_=411 K if one can suppose _m_' = 0.1 (the general value of _m_' ranges from 0.1 to 0.2). Here k =_N__E__F__V_, V is the electron-phonon coupling parameter, and _m_' is the electron-electron repulsive screening parameter to the Cooper pairing attractive force. If this is the case, a large electron-phonon coupling strength must be constrained in this system considering that the _N__E__F_ is small.

From the evolution of specific heat as a function of magnetic field, [_d__t__c_2/ _d__T_] can be estimated as a linear plot of _H__c_2 vs T_{c}. Using the WHH equation of 0.69 x [_d__t__c_2/ _d__T_] =_g_T__c_, the upper critical field of _H__c_2(_T_ =0) was extrapolated to be 0.24 T. This leads to a Ginzburg-Landau coherence length x to be 372 A using _g_=[{{\Phi}_{0}/[2\pi H_{c}(2T{\mathrm{=}}0)]}] 1/2. The mean free path t of conduction electrons can be estimated to be 0.67 A using _t_=_mv__F_/(_n_e_2). Here the resistivity r = 10 mJ cm and Fermi velocity _v__F_=_h__k__F_/_m_ of 4.92 x 107 cm s-1 were employed, and k_{F} for the carrier concentration was estimated by the Seebeck coefficient. This concludes that Ba24Si100 is a superconductor classified as a dirty limit of t  x.

## IV Conclusion

Ba24Si100 was reported to superconduct like Ba24Ge100. Physical parameters were obtained for the Ba24Si100 superconductor from resistivity, specific heat capacity, and ac and dc magnetic susceptibility measurements. The physical parameters derived by these experiments implied that this system can be featured by the extremely strong electron-phonon coupling strength and is a superconductor in the dirty limit. The endohedral Ba atom rattling motion seems to be closely associated with this strong _e_-ph coupling parameter from the experimental viewpoint and this may open a route for searching exotic materials in the future.

Figure 8: Raman spectra measured for Ba24Si100 and Ba24Ge100 at 300 K. For comparison, the spectra of BaSi2, Si, and Ge in the diamond type are displayed. The arrows indicate the corresponding shifts between Si and Ge as described in the text.

  _Note Added in Proof._ Recently, the superconductivity of Ba_{24}**Si_{100}** was also confirmed [21].
