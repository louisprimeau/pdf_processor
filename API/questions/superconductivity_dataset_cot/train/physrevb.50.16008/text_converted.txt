###### Abstract

The crystal structure of the newly discovered 117-K superconductor,
(Cu,C)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11+8, has been refined from time-of-flight
neutron-powder-diffraction data. The structure has "average" tetragonal
symmetry and is similar to that of Tl(for Hg]Ba2Ca3Cu4O7. C atoms in CO3
groups substitute at the Cu site in the (Cu,C)O1+8 layer leading to a
chemical composition of (Cu0.64C0.3)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11.06. This compound has
two inequivalent kinds of CuO2 layers with pyramidal and square
coordination of Cu to oxygen. The inner CuO2 layers with Cu in four
coordination are less corrugated than the outer ones with Cu in five
coordination, and exhibit a structure very similar to those of
infinite-layer compounds.

## I Introduction

Several authors have recently reported the synthesis at high pressure of
superconducting compounds with the general formula _A_Ba2Ca3Cu4O7 and
with superconducting transition temperatures (T_(c)) of 117 K.1-4
Because of the difficulties of obtaining single-phase materials and of
performing detailed structural analysis on the small samples obtained
from high-pressure synthesis techniques, it is not yet clear whether
these workers have obtained the same compound or whether compounds with
the same T_(c) but with different chemical compositions actually exist.

Ihara _et al._1 reported the synthesis of AgBa2Ca_(n − 1)Cu_(n)O_(y) in
a series of experiments in which they attempted to replace Tl(or Hg) in
Tl(or Hg)Ba2Ca_(n − 1)Cu_(n)O_(y) with Ag. Although their sample was
mixed phase, they observed bulk superconductivity with a T_(c) of 117 K
and a large diamagnetic signal. They concluded that the crystal
structure of the 117-K superconducting phase was isostructural with that
of Tl(or Hg)Ba2Ca3Cu4O7 [Tl(or Hg)-1234] from x-ray-diffraction data and
that the chemical composition was (Ag0.25Cu0.75)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11 from
electron-probe microanalysis. They also observed a 2a ×_b ×_2c_
superstructure in an electron-diffraction pattern, and speculated that
this resulted from an ordered arrangement of Ag and Cu atoms in the site
shared by these atoms.

Kawashima, Matsui, and Takayama-Muromachi [2] isolated a superconducting
phase with T_(c) = 117 K during studies of various phases in the
Ag-Ba-Ca-Cu-O system. Electron-probe microanalysis of their sample
revealed that the 117-K superconducting phase, which was isostructural
with Tl(or Hg)-1234, contained no silver, but that it did contain
carbon. They also observed a superstructure of 2a ×_b ×_2c_ by electron
diffraction. They concluded that the chemical composition of their
material was (Cu0.5C0.5)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11+8 and that the superstructure
resulted from ordering of Cu and C atoms. The replacement of Cu atoms by
C atoms, in the form of CO3 units, has been observed in other
superconducting materials, such as
(Y1-_x_Ca_x_0.95Sr2.05Cu2.4(CO3)0.6O9, 5 where C atoms in CO3 groups
partially substitute for Cu atoms on the "chain" site in the YBa2Cu3O7.8
(Y-123) structure. Thus, the structure proposed by Kawashima, Matsui,
and Takayama-Muromachi,2 (Cu0.5C0.5)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11+8 with C occurring as
CO3 units substituted on a Cu site, is consistent with what is known
about the crystal chemistry of these materials.

Jin _et al._3 and Wu _et al._4 also prepared a new superconducting
compound in the Ba-Ca-Cu-O system with T_(c) of 117 K using
high-pressure synthesis techniques. They speculated that one of a new
homologous series of compounds, CuBa2Ca_(n − 1)Cu_(n)O_(y),
isostructural to the single-layer Tl- or Hg-based compounds Tl(or
Hg)Ba2Ca_(n − 1)Cu_(n)O_(y), was responsible for the observed
superconductivity. X-ray- and electron-diffraction patterns showed the
presence of a tetragonal phase with a = 3.88 A and c = 18.3 A in
mixed-phase samples, leading them to conclude that the superconducting
material was the n = 4 member of the series. Interestingly, they made
their samples from oxides rather than carbonates, and did not observe
the presence of carbon in their n = 4 samples, nor was any
superstructure observed.6 They also tried to synthesize AgBa2Ca2Cu4O7
but observed no silver in the resulting perovskite-related compound.7

Footnote 1: 1994 The American Physical Society Kawashima, Matsui, and
Takayama-Muromachi [2] observed _c_-axis lattice constants near 17.9 A
for their compound while Jin _et al._[3] and Wu _et al._[4] observed
18.3 A for their compound that contained no carbon. If this explanation
is correct, however, it is puzzling that the _T_c does not change with
carbon content.

In this paper, we report the results of a structural refinement using
neutron-powder-diffraction data for a 117-K superconducting
(Cu,C)Ba₂Ca₃Cu₄O_(11 + δ) compound, (Cu,C)-1234, synthesized at high
pressure. Other compounds with four CuO₂ layers, such as Tl(or
Hg)Ba₂Ca₃Cu₄O_(y) and Tl₂Ba₂Ca₃Cu₄O_(y), often contain considerable
amounts of intergrowths, which hinder precise structure refinement. The
present (Cu,C)-1234 sample, in contrast, shows sharp diffraction peaks
suggesting the absence of such intergrowths. Thus, from this refinement,
we are able to learn important characteristic structural parameters such
as the Cu-Cu distance between the two square (inner) CuO₂ sheets and the
O-Cu-O bond angles in these sheets.

## II Sample synthesis and neutron diffraction

A 190-mg sintered powder sample of (Cu,C)Ba₂Ca₃Cu₄O_(11 + δ) was
synthesized at high pressure in the same manner as previously
reported.[2] A mixture having a composition of
C_(0.5)Ba₂Ca₃Cu₄,C_(011.1) was prepared from BaCuO₂, Ca₂CuO₃, CuO, and
CaCO₃. The BaCuO₂ compound, which had been prepared from BaCO₃ and CuO
at 900 degC, contained about 0.95 mass

Time-of-flight neutron-powder-diffraction data of the sample were
collected for 20 h at room temperature on the Special Environment Powder
Diffractometer (SEPD) at Argonne’s Intense Pulsed Neutron Source
(IPNS).[8] The sample was suspended in the neutron beam on an amorphous
boron fiber to minimize background. The crystal structure was refined by
the Rietveld technique[9] using the high-resolution data from the
backscattering (2_th_ = 145deg) detector banks.

## III Structural refinement

Bragg peaks from small amounts (less than 5

In an initial stage of the refinement, occupation of the (Cu1,C) site at
a 1a (0,0,0) position was assumed to be (Cu_(0.5)C_(0.5)) as suggested
by previous chemical analyses of samples prepared in the same way,[2]
and O1 oxygen site was located at a 2_f_(0.5,0,0) position with a 50

We then refined the structure with a model that allowed the partial
substitution of C as a unit of CO₃ at the Cu1 site (see Fig. 2). Since
the CO₃ unit is inherently inconsistent with tetragonal symmetry, the
refinement based on such a model requires some assumptions about the
structure to be imposed in the form of constraints. We assumed that the
C atom occupies the same site as the Cu1 atom (i.e., no displacements
off the ideal Cu1 site were allowed – see Fig. 2) and that Cu1 and C
each have their own distinct oxygen coordination. The planar anion
CO₃[2] is a fairly rigid structural unit owing to the covalency of the
C-O bonds. We therefore constrained the CO₃ unit to be planar and to be
perfectly triangular.

Figure 1: Temperature dependence of the ac susceptibility for
(Cu,C)Ba₂Ca₃Cu₄O_(11 + δ).

Two of the oxygen atoms bonded to each C atom, O2B shown in Fig. 2, are
apical oxygen atoms for CuO₃ pyramids in the neighboring planes. The
third oxygen atom, O1B, is on the plane of the Cu1 and C atoms. The Cu1
atoms in the (Cu1,C)O plane were assumed to be coordinated to four
oxygen atoms as in the chainlike coordination in the YBa₂Cu₃O_(7 − δ)
compound. Two of the four possible oxygen sites O1A around each Cu1 site
are occupied to achieve this configuration. The CuO₄ and CO₃ units were
assumed to be oriented along the [100] or the equivalent [010]
direction. Refinement of the average structure using tetragonal symmetry
cannot yield any information about possible ordering involving the
orientations or positions of the CuO₄ and CO₃ units. However, one might
expect ordering over some length scale from a crystal-chemistry point of
view. If the length scale were short, this could explain the observation
of a superstructure by electron diffraction, but not neutron
diffraction.

This structural model with CO₃ groups and a chainlike oxygen
configuration around Cu1 resulted in a significant improvement in the
fit. The thermal parameters for the relevant sites decreased
considerably. The somewhat large thermal parameter for the (Cu1,C) site
(2.6 A [2]) suggests that our assumption that C substitutes exactly on
the Cu1 site may not be perfectly correct. However, this constraint is
the best choice for modeling the average structure. The refined C-O bond
length in the CO₃ cluster is 1.23 A, which is very close to the observed
bond length of C-O in CO₃ groups in other compounds containing carbonate
ions.[11][13] This internally consistent result implies that our choice
of constraints for the average structure is appropriate.

Figure 3: Neutron-powder-diffraction data and the Rietveld refinement
profile for (Cu_(x)C)Ba₂Ca₃Cu₄O_(11 + δ). The raw time-of-flight
diffraction data are shown as plus marks; the calculated profile is
shown as a solid line. Tick marks below the profile mark the positions
of allowed reflections. The differences between the observed and the
calculated intensities are shown at the bottom. The sample also contains
a small amount of Ag (intermediate marks) and a high-pressure form of
Ag₂O (lower marks).

Figure 2: Structure of (Cu_(x)C)Ba₂Ca₃Cu₄O_(11 + δ). Cu1 and C are
located in the shared site. Cu1 has chainlike oxygen coordination (O1A
and O2A). C is bonded to three oxygen atoms (O1B and O2B) forming a CO₃
group. Two oxygen atoms in the CO₃ group occupy the apical positions of
CuO₃ pyramids, but they are displaced from the ideal (0,0,z) position.
Cu2 and O3 are in the outer CuO₂ plane. Cu3 and O4 are in the inner CuO₂
plane. Although the present analysis of the average tetragonal structure
cannot yield any information about possible ordering and orientation of
the chainlike CuO₄ and CO₃ units, the structure is drawn to be
consistent with the 2a × b × 2c superstructure which is seen in electron
diffraction. Cu1 and C are the origin of the average tetragonal unit
cell in the refinement (Table 1).

In the final stage of the refinements, site occupancies of Cu1 and C in
the shared site were refined, with the total occupancy of the site being
constrained to be 1. Site occupancies of the oxygen sites, O1B, O2A, and
O2B, were constrained to be consistent with the Cu1:C ratio, and that of
the O1A site was refined without any constraint. Although the Cu1:C
ratio in the (Cu1,C) site was expected to be 1:1 according to the
previous chemical analysis for the samples synthesized in the same
way,[2] our refinement gave a significant decrease in the R factor (from
11.43 to 10.68) when this ratio converged to 0.68:0.32. The refined
occupation number of O1A is 0.74, which is very close to the refined
occupation number of Cu1, 0.68. This result is consistent with our
assumption of a chainlike oxygen configuration around the Cu1 atom.
However, it is impossible to conclude whether the possible chain oxygen
sites are fully occupied or whether oxygen sites between chains are
partially occupied without knowing the orientation of the CO3 units
(which cannot be learned from the present refinements). It is most
logical from the point of view of oxygen-oxygen repulsion that the CO3
units are oriented perpendicular to the chains. If this assumption is
correct, the occupation of 0.74 for the O1A site implies that
0.26(=1.0-0.74) possible chain sites remain vacant. If the CO3 groups
are oriented parallel to the chains, 0.06(=0.74-0.68) oxygen atoms per
formula unit are required to be located between chains.

Since we have imposed a number of constraints on the atomic
configuration in the (Cu1,ClO1+8 layer, our refined values for the
carbon and oxygen contents may not be accurate. However, in light of the
results of Jin _et al._[3] and Wu _et al._,[4] who reported the
synthesis of a sample with T_(c) = 117 K containing no carbon, it seems
reasonable that the Cu:C ratio in this layer is variable and depends on
synthesis conditions. Further experiments are required to confirm this
issue and to determine whether the oxygen content (related to the
occupancy of the O1A site) is also variable, allowing a means for
changing the superconducting properties.

Partial substitution of Ca for Ba was also suggested by chemical
analysis of the previous samples.[2] However, refinements in which the
occupancy of the Ba site was allowed to vary gave no evidence for such a
substitution in the present sample.

The neutron-powder-diffraction data and Rietveld refinement profile
based on the final model are shown in Fig. 3. The refined values of the
structural parameters are listed in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and
bond angles are listed in Table 2.

Table 3: Comparison of the interatomic distances and bond angles in the
structural unit of CuO₂-Ca-CuO₂ for the (Cu,C)-1234 and infinite-layer
compounds. The values for the hypothetical compound CaCuO₂ were obtained
by Takano _et al._ (see Ref. [15]).

whether this resulted from the structural distortions associated with
the displaced apical oxygen sites or from a change in the number of
charge carriers. One explanation for the present result is that, even
though the presence of distorted apical oxygen sites degrades
superconductivity for the two outer CuO₂ layers, the two inner layers
support superconductivity with a high T_(c). The recently discovered
HgBa₂CaCu₂O_(6 + δ) compound exhibits a T_(c) of 128 K, the highest
value observed for a two-layer compound,[24] supporting the idea that a
T_(c) of 117 K should be possible for the present compound even if only
the two inner CuO₂ layers were contributing.

If such a hypothesis were true, one would expect that insertion of CO₃
units would lower T_(c) more for compounds with a smaller number of CuO₂
layers. The available data cannot provide a definitive test of this idea
because T_(c) may not have been optimized after the incorporation of CO₃
units in individual studies. In addition, the chemistry is not identical
(e.g., no Ba is present in some compounds). However, it is instructive
to consider the properties of several CO₃-containing cuprates that have
been found so far. The single-layer compound Sr₂CuO₂CO₃, which has a
structure with CuO₆ octahedra, is not superconducting.[11] This material
can be made superconducting by appropriate hole doping, such as
(Ba_(x)Sr_(1 − x))₂Cu_(y)O_(xy + δ)(CO₃)_(1 − y) (Ref. [25]) and
Sr₂CuO₂(CO₃)_(1 − x)(BO₃)_(x),[26] with T_(c)’s of 46 and 32 K,
respectively. Thus, it is immediately clear that the partial
incorporation of CO₃ units into the charge reservoir, giving rise to
distortions in the apical oxygen positions, does not preclude
superconductivity. Two-layer compounds where C atoms in CO₃ groups
substitute for Cu atoms on the chain site in the YBa₂Cu₃O_(7 − δ)
structure include the nonsuperconductor
(C_(0.4)Cu_(0.6))Sr₂(Y_(0.86)Sr_(0.14))Cu₂O₇,[12] and the superconductor

$$(Y_{1-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)\({}_{0.95}\)Sr\({}_{2.05}\)Cu\({}_{2.4}\)(CO\({}_{3}\))\({}_{0.6}\)O\({}_{y}$$

with T_(c) of 63 K.[5] For the (Cu,C)-12(n − 1)n series, Kawashima,
Matsui, and Takayama-Muromachi[2] reported T_(c) = 67 K for the n = 3
member and T_(c) = 117 K for the n = 4 member (present compound).
Therefore a series of compounds from n = 1 to 4 in (Cu,C)-12(n − 1)n
exists and shows superconductivity. The n = 4 compound shows the highest
T_(c) among the series of the compounds. Empirically, in Tl- and
Hg-based superconductors, n = 3 compounds show the highest T_(c)’s and
T_(c)’s go down as n increases further.[16, 22] Although the data are
admittedly not complete, the (Cu,C)-12(n − 1)n series seems to violate
this empirical rule.

This unusual superconducting behavior suggests at least two additional
experiments. If one accepts the argument that the inner CuO₂ layers are
mostly responsible for the T_(c) as high as 117 K, the present
(Cu,C)-1234 compound is effectively a two-layer compound. It then
becomes important to attempt the synthesis of the n = 5 member of the
series (which may be possible at high pressure) in hopes of obtaining a
T_(c) higher than 117 K. On the other hand, optimization of the T_(c)
for the n = 3 compound is interesting in connection with the empirical
rule that the n = 3 compounds show the highest T_(c)’s in one series of
compounds. It may exhibit a T_(c) higher than 117 K.

Figure 2: Structure of (Cu,C)Ba₂Ca₃Cu₄O_(11 + δ). Cu1 and C are located
in the shared site. Cu1 has chainlike oxygen coordination (O1A and O2A).
C is bonded to three oxygen atoms (O1B and O2B) forming a CO₃ group. Two
oxygen atoms in the CO₃ group occupy the apical positions of CuO₅
pyramids, but they are displaced from the ideal (0,0,z) position. Cu2
and O3 are in the outer CuO₂ plane. Cu3 and O4 are in the inner CuO₂
plane. Although the present analysis of the average tetragonal structure
cannot yield any information about possible ordering and orientation of
the chainlike CuO₄ and CO₃ units, the structure is drawn to be
consistent with the 2a × b × 2c superstructure which is seen in electron
diffraction. Cu1 and C are the origin of the average tetragonal unit
cell in the refinement (Table 1).
