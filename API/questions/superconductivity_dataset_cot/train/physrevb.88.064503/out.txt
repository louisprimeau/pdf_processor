###### Abstract

Electrical resistivity measurements as a function of temperature between 1 and 300 K were performed at various pressures up to 3 GPa on the superconducting layered compounds _Ln_O_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 (_Ln_ = La, Ce). At atmospheric pressure, LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 have superconducting critical temperatures _T_c of 3.3 and 2.3 K, respectively. For both compounds, the superconducting critical temperature _T_c initially increases, reaches a maximum value of 10.1 K for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 and 6.7 K for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2, and then gradually decreases with increasing pressure. Both samples also exhibit transient behavior in the region between the lower _T_c phase near atmospheric pressure and the higher _T_c phase at higher pressures. This region is characterized by a broadening of the superconducting transition, in which _T_c and the transition width \Delta_T_c are reversible with increasing and decreasing pressure. There is also an appreciable pressure-induced and hysteretic suppression of semiconducting behavior up to the pressure at which the maximum value of _T_c is found. At pressures above the value at which the maximum in _T_c occurs, there is a gradual decrease of _T_c and further suppression of the semiconducting behavior with pressure, both of which are reversible.

## I Introduction

Superconductivity with a superconducting critical temperature _T_c = 8.6 K has recently been reported in the layered compound Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}.^{1,2} Following this report, other BiS2-based superconductors including _Ln_O_{1-x}F_{x}BiS2 (_Ln_ = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb) with a _T_c as high as 10.6 K have been synthesized and studied.^{3,4-12} More recent work demonstrates that chemical substitution of the tetravalent ions Th^{+4}, Hf^{+4}, Zr^{+4}, and Ti^{+4} for trivalent lanthanum, La^{+3}, in LaOBiS2 increases the charge-carrier density and induces superconductivity.^{13} Most of the research on the layered BiS2 compounds has heretofore centered on the effect of chemical substitution on superconductivity. Application of an external pressure may also be employed as a method for reducing the unit cell volume of these compounds and studying the resultant effect on superconductivity. In this paper, we report measurements of the pressure dependence of the normal state electrical resistivity between 1 and 300 K and _T_c at various pressures up to \sim3 GPa for the compounds LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2. We compare our results to recently reported studies of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 samples synthesized under high pressure by Kotegawa _et al.^{7}_

The qualitative evolution of _T_c with pressure is markedly similar for both LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2, which have _T_c values (at atmospheric pressure) of 3.3 and 2.2 K, respectively. For both compounds, _T_c initially increases, reaches a maximum value of 10.1 K at \sim1 GPa for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 and 6.7 K at \sim2 GPa for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2, and then gradually decreases with increasing pressure. Both compounds also exhibit striking transient behavior in the region between the lower _T_c phase near atmospheric pressure and the higher _T_c phase at higher pressures. This transient region is characterized by a rapid increase of _T_c and an increase of the superconducting transition width \Delta_T_c, in which both _T_c and \Delta_T_c are reversible with increasing and decreasing pressure cycles. This occurs over a range in pressure from \sim0.5 to 1.1 GPa for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 and from \sim0.5 to 1.5 GPa for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2. In both materials, there is a sizable pressure-induced suppression of semiconducting behavior exhibiting hysteresis up to the pressure at which the maximum value of _T_c is found. The rapid increase of the charge carrier density inferred from the suppression of the semiconducting behavior correlates with the rapid increase of _T_c in this region. At pressures above the value at which the maximum in _T_c occurs, there is a gradual decrease of _T_c and further suppression of the semiconducting behavior with pressure, both of which are reversible.

## II Experimental Details

Polycrystalline samples of _Ln_O_{1-x}F_{x}BiS2 (_Ln_ = La, Ce) with x = 0.5 were prepared by solid-state reaction using powders of La_{2}O_{3} (99.9%), LaF_{3} (99.9%), La_{2}S_{3} (99.9%) and Bi_{2}S_{3} (99.9%) for LaO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS2, and powders of CeF_{3} (99.9%) and CeO_{2} (99.9%) for CeO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS2. Bi_{2}S3 precursor powder was prepared in an evacuated quartz tube by reacting Bi (99.99%) and S (99.9%) at 500 degC for 10 hours. The _Ln_2S_{3} (_Ln_ = La, Ce) precursor powders were prepared in an evacuated quartz tube by reacting chunks of La and Ce with S grains at 800 degC for 12 hours. The starting materials with nominal composition _Ln_O_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 (_Ln_ = La, Ce) were weighed, thoroughly mixed, pressed into pellets, sealed in evacuated quartz tubes, and annealed at 800 degC for 10 hours. The products were then ground, mixed for homogenization, pressed into pellets, and annealed again in evacuated quartz tubes at 800 degC for 10 hours. X-ray powder diffraction measurements were made using an x-ray diffractometer with a Cu K_{\alpha} source to assess phase purity and to determine the crystal structure of the _Ln_O_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 (_Ln_ = La, Ce) compounds. Lattice parameters for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 are a = 4.0613 A and c = 13.3157 A, while for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 the lattice parameters are a = 4.0398 A and c = 13.4513 A.^{12}  Measurements of \rho(T) under applied pressure were performed up to \sim3 GPa in a clamped piston cylinder pressure cell between \sim1 and 300 K in a pumped ^{4}He dewar. A 1:1 by volume mixture of n-pentane and isoamyl alcohol was used to provide a quasihydrostatic pressure transmitting medium. A second set of electrical resistivity measurements were performed by releasing pressure from the pressurized cell down to atmospheric pressure. Annealed Pt leads were affixed to gold-sputtered contact surfaces on each sample with silver epoxy in a standard four-wire configuration. The pressure dependent superconducting T_{c} of high purity Sn, measured inductively, was used as a manometer and calibrated against data from Ref. [14].

## III Results and discussion

The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity \rho below 300 K for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} at various pressures is displayed in Fig. 1. Figure 1(a) shows \rho(T) upon increasing pressure to 3.1 GPa, while Fig. 1(b) gives \rho(T) upon decreasing pressure back down to 0.31 GPa. The temperature dependence of \rho(T) at lower pressures exhibits semiconducting behavior. The semiconducting behavior is suppressed with increasing pressure as seen from the nearly constant \rho(T) curves above 2 GPa. A comparison of Fig. 1(a) with Fig. 1(b) shows that the suppression of \rho(T) is continuous and reversible over the full range 0.3-3.1 GPa. At pressures above 2 GPa where suppression is greatest, the values of \rho(T) are comparable in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) and reversible with pressure. However, whereas the suppression of \rho(T) is reversible with pressure, the magnitude of \rho(T) exhibits hysteretic behavior with pressure. At lower pressures, measurements of \rho(T) made during release of pressure yield higher values than \rho(T) measurements performed upon increasing pressure. The difference between \rho(T) measurements made during increasing pressure and those made during decreasing pressure

  are largest at lower pressures where the rate of suppression of semiconducting behavior is largest. After a release in pressure to the lowest value of 0.31 GPa, the maximum value of \rho is nearly 14 m\Omega cm. This is a factor of 2 larger than the corresponding value along the increasing pressure path at 0.34 GPa.

Superconducting transitions at low temperature were measured upon increasing and then releasing pressure as shown in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d), respectively. There is a striking similarity in the qualitative behavior and evolution of the transitions in both plots. For pressures in the range 0.5 to 1.0 GPa, the superconducting transitions broaden significantly. For higher pressures above 1.0 GPa, the transition curves begin to sharpen again at approximately 10 K. It is in this higher pressure region where T_{c} passes through a maximum of 10.1 K at \sim1 GPa and then gradually decreases as pressure increases. The evolution of both the value of the superconducting critical temperature T_{c} and the superconducting transition \Delta T_{c} defined by the procedure described in the text, were reversible with respect to both increasing and decreasing pressure. T_{c} was defined as the temperature at which \rho falls to 50% of its value at the temperature of the onset of superconductivity T_{c}^{\rm onset} with T_{c}^{\rm onset} determined as illustrated in Fig. 1(c). The temperature where the resistivity vanishes T_{0} was determined in a similar fashion as T_{c}^{\rm onset} using a linear extrapolation of the resistive superconducting curve to \rho = 0. In determining T_{c} for the broader transitions, we used the same criteria as for the sharper transitions; however, we make note of the less definitive T_{c} for these broader transitions.

Measurements performed on CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} reveal remarkably similar behavior to the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} results. As shown in Fig. 2, the qualitative behavior of the results are reversible upon application and release of pressure. Measurements of \rho(T) show semiconducting behavior which is suppressed at higher pressures. As pressure is released, the semiconducting behavior is recovered. The measured values of \rho(T) are higher along the reversed path during a release of pressure. The discrepancy between \rho(T) measurements made

At lower pressures, the compound exhibits semiconducting behavior. The semiconducting behavior is suppressed at higher pressure as seen from the flattening of the curves. (c), (d) Resistive superconducting transition curves for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} at various pressures upon (c) increasing and (d) decreasing pressure. T_{c} increases from 2.3 K to a maximum of 6.7 K and then gradually decreases.

  during increasing pressure and those made during decreasing pressure are largest at lower pressures where the rate of suppression of the semiconducting behavior is largest. After releasing the pressure to the lowest value of 0.31 GPa, \rho is nearly 130 m\Omega cm; this is a factor of 1.5 larger than the corresponding value along the increasing pressure path at 0.34 GPa.

Superconducting transitions at low temperature were measured for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} while increasing and then decreasing pressure. The trend and character of the transitions are reversible upon application and subsequent release of pressure as seen from a comparison of Figs. 2(c) and 2(d). Similar to the evolution of T_{c} in LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, sharp superconducting transitions are observed at low pressures up to approximately 0.5 GPa before they begin to broaden. From both the increasing and decreasing pressure plots [Figs. 2(c) and 2(d), respectively], the transitions begin to broaden significantly up to pressures of approximately 1.5 GPa. At pressures above 1.5 GPa, the superconducting transitions become sharp again. It is in this pressure region where T_{c} passes through a maximum of 6.7 K at \sim2 GPa and then decreases gradually at higher pressures.

Figure 3 summarizes the results for the superconducting phase diagram T_{c}(P) for both the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compounds. The measurements were performed first by increasing the pressure monotonically in six steps (filled symbols) up to 3.1 GPa, followed by a monotonic decrease in pressure in nine steps (open symbols) back down to 0.31 GPa. The phase diagram indicates T_{c}(P) is highly reversible for both compounds; negligible pressure hysteresis is observed even in the regions where the resistive transition broadens significantly.

The phase diagram in Fig. 3 shows T_{c} maxima for both the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compounds. In the case of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, T_{c} initially increases with pressure up to a maximum of 10.1 K at 1.1 GPa. T_{c} then gradually decreases with a slope of -0.30 K GPa^{-1}. This T_{c} maximum is also preceded by a reversible broadening of the superconducting transition in the pressure range 0.5-1.0 GPa, represented as elongated vertical bars in Fig. 3. In the normal state [above the T_{c}(P) curve], the semiconducting behavior of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} is continuously suppressed with pressure as manifested in an energy gap \Delta_{1} that decreases with pressure, the values of which are indicated in the legend. The determination of the energy gaps \Delta_{1} and \Delta_{2} from the \rho(T,P) data are discussed below. This maximum in T_{c}(P) at 1.1 GPa occurs in the vicinity of a change of slope in the normal state log(\rho) vs P relation, measured at 11 K, as shown in Fig. 4.

In the case of CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, T_{c} initially increases to a maximum of 6.7 K at \sim2 GPa and then decreases slowly with a slope of -0.30 K GPa^{-1} at higher pressures. Leading up to this maximum is a reversible broadening of the superconducting transition in the region 0.5-1.5 GPa depicted by the lengthened vertical bars in Fig. 3. In the normal state [above the T_{c}(P) curve], the semiconducting behavior of CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} is also continuously suppressed with pressure as manifested in an energy gap \Delta_{1} that decreases with pressure, the values of which are indicated in the legend. The maximum in T_{c}(P) at 2 GPa also occurs in the vicinity of a slope change in log(\rho) vs P, measured at 7.6 K, as shown in Fig. 4.

The width of the superconducting transitions in the broadening region, represented by the length of the vertical bars in Fig. 3, is \Delta T_{c}\sim4-6 K. Pressure gradients in the piston-cylinder cell were estimated from the error in pressure to be of the order \Delta P\sim\pm 0.05 GPa where the error in pressure was determined from the width of the superconducting transition of the Sn manometer. It is possible to relate \Delta T_{c} and \Delta P through the slope of T_{c}(P) in Fig. 3 so that \Delta T_{c}\simeq(dT_{c}(P)/dP)\Delta P. Even though \Delta P is small

T_{c} was defined as the temperature at which the electrical resistivity \rho falls to 50% of its value at the temperature of the onset of superconductivity T_{c}^{\rm onset}. The length of the vertical bars indicate the superconducting transition width \Delta T_{c} and vertical bar caps indicate T_{c}^{\rm onset} (upper) and T_{0} (lower). Filled symbols denote measurements performed upon increasing pressure, while open symbols represent measurements made upon decreasing pressure. The solid black curves are guides to the eye. The change in color in the semiconducting normal state region represents the suppression of the semiconducting behavior with pressure as manifested in the decrease of the energy gap \Delta_{1} whose values are indicated in the legend.

  and constant for pressures measured as part of this study, \Delta T_{c} can be large when dT_{c}(P)/dP is large (i.e., in the pressure region where broadened transitions are observed). Rough estimates of \Delta T_{c} were made using \Delta P = 0.1 GPa and slopes of 18 and 11 K/GPa for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, respectively. These calculations yield values of \Delta T_{c} = 1.8 and 1.1 K for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, respectively, which are of the correct order of magnitude. The size of the vertical bars characterizing \Delta T_{c} also appear to qualitatively track with the local slope of T_{c}(P) for most pressures in Fig. 3.

Kotegawa _et al._[7] previously reported the pressure dependence of T_{c} for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} samples synthesized under high pressure, which apparently exhibit only the high T_{c} phase uncovered in the present study. In their experiments, it was found that T_{c} exhibits a maximum of 10.6 K at \sim1 GPa and then gradually decreases with a slope of -0.40 K/GPa (compared to -0.30 K/GPa in this study) at pressures above 1 GPa. The low T_{c} phase and broadened superconducting transitions bridging the low T_{c} and high T_{c} phases, however, are not present in their T_{c}(P) phase diagram. The presence of only the high T_{c} phase at ambient pressure in the study by Kotegawa _et al._[7] suggests that synthesis of the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} samples under high pressure has already induced the high T_{c} superconducting phase.

From the plot of log(\rho) vs P at low temperature displayed in Fig. 4, there is a noticeable change in the magnitude of the suppression rate dlog(\rho)/dP for both the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compounds. In the case of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, there is a strong suppression of resistivity up to \sim1.2 GPa, followed by a weaker suppression at higher pressures. In the case of CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, there is a strong suppression of resistivity up to \sim1.8 GPa, followed by a weaker suppression at higher pressures. The \rho(P) data for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} were taken in the normal state at 11 and 7.6 K, respectively. These temperatures occur just above the onset of the superconducting transition at T_{c}^{\rm onset}. The dotted lines in Fig. 4 are guides to the eye for the rates of suppression of log(\rho) with pressure.

There is a correlation between the pressure at which the maximum T_{c} occurs in the T_{c}(P) phase diagram of Fig. 3 and the pressure where the suppression rate changes in the plot of log(\rho) vs P in Fig. 4. For LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, this "critical pressure" occurs at \sim1.2 GPa, while for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} it is located at \sim1.8 GPa. In both compounds, there is also an apparent pressure hysteresis as seen from the separation between the increasing pressure data (open symbols) and the decreasing pressure data (filled symbols). This pressure hysteresis becomes more pronounced where the suppression rate is higher, i.e., below the previously mentioned critical pressures.

The semiconducting behavior of the \rho(T) data and its rapid suppression with pressure was noted in the work of Kotegawa _et al._[7] on the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compound synthesized under high pressure. They observed that the resistivity could be described over two distinct regions by the relation

\[\rho(T)=\rho_{0}e^{\Delta/2k_{B}T},\] (1)

where \rho_{0} is a constant and \Delta is an energy gap. Analysis of the \rho(T) data at atmospheric pressure in these two regions, 200-300 K and T_{c}-20 K, yielded energy gaps \Delta_{1}/k_{B}\approx 140 and \Delta_{2}/k_{B}\approx 1.86 K, respectively. Both energy gaps \Delta_{1} and \Delta_{2} were found to decrease with pressure. In this study, we have also determined values of the energy gaps \Delta_{1} and \Delta_{2} from linear fits of \rho(T) data on a plot of log(\rho) vs 1/T, as illustrated in Fig. 5, which displays our \rho(T) data for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} upon increasing pressure. From similar plots for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} upon decreasing pressure as well as for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} upon increasing and decreasing pressure, the

Electrical resistivity values for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} were taken at T = 7.6 K, while \rho values for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} were taken at T = 11 K. Filled (open) symbols represent measurements upon increasing (decreasing) pressure. Dotted lines reflect the slopes (suppression rates), and arrows point to changing slopes at \sim1.2 GPa and \sim1.8 GPa in LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, respectively. The break in slope occurs at a pressure near that at which T_{c} reaches a maximum for both LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}.

  two energy gaps \Delta_{1} and \Delta_{2}, corresponding to the high and low temperature regions, respectively, could also be extracted.

The behavior of energy gaps \Delta_{1} and \Delta_{2} as a function of pressure for both LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} are shown in Fig. 6. The energy gaps decrease rapidly with pressure, similar to the behavior observed by Kotegawa _et al._[7] However, it is interesting to note that the values of the energy gaps for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} at atmospheric pressure shown in Fig. 6 are considerably larger than the values obtained by Kotegawa _et al._[7] The energy gaps \Delta_{1} and \Delta_{2} both exhibit hysteretic behavior below a critical pressure of \sim1.3 GPa for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and \sim2 GPa for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}; these critical pressures correlate with the pressures where the slope dlog(\rho)/d P changes (at temperatures in the normal state right above T_{c}) in the log(\rho) vs P plots [Fig. 4]) and also correlate with the transition pressures into the high T_{c} phase for both LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} [Fig. 3].

Specific heat C(T) measurements at ambient pressure have recently been made on both the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compounds.[12] The samples in Ref. [12] and in the present study were from the same batch. In the case of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, these C(T) measurements suggest that the superconductivity observed at \sim3 K for pressures less than \sim0.5 GPa is a bulk phenomenon. In Fig. 5 of Ref. [12], there is a clear jump in C(T)/T at T_{c} = 2.93 K. This value of T_{c} is close to the temperature where \rho vanishes in LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}. We expect, therefore, that the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} sample in this study exhibits bulk superconductivity at lower pressures.

It is still unclear whether or not the higher T_{c} superconducting transitions at pressures above 0.5 GPa are associated with bulk superconductivity. The narrow widths of the superconducting transitions would seem to suggest that the superconductivity in this pressure range is a bulk phenomenon. However, the sharpness of the resistive transitions is also consistent with a filamentary zero resistance path through the sample with a narrow distribution of T_{c} values that could be due to small amounts of a superconducting phase, rather than bulk superconductivity. High pressure magnetization

Energy gaps were fitted with Eq. (1) using the data shown in Fig. 5. Filled (open) symbols were obtained upon increasing (decreasing) pressure cycles.

  measurements in a SQUID magnetometer were performed on several pieces of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} to determine the character of the 10 K superconducting phase by Taufour, Bud'ko, and Canfield.[15] It was difficult to observe a diamagnetic signal against the large background from the pressure cell. This suggests possible inhomogeneity in the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} sample.

In the case of CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, however, there is no indication in the ambient pressure C(T) measurements of bulk superconductivity.[12] The lack of a discernible jump in specific heat, however, could be due to sample inhomogeneity and/or the proximity of T_{c} = 1.9 K to the base temperature T = 1.8 K of the specific heat measurements and needs to be investigated further.

The rapid increase of T_{c} and broadening of the superconducting transition with pressure, as well as its reversibility with pressure for both compounds, suggest the existence of a gradual, pressure-induced transition between superconducting phases with a lower T_{c} at lower pressure and a higher T_{c} at higher pressure. The broadening of the superconducting transition feature in the transition region, \sim1 GPa wide for both compounds, could be a consequence of the large slope of T_{c}(P) in that pressure range [i.e., \Delta T_{c}\simeq(dT_{c}(P)/dP)\Delta P]. It might also be due to a spatial distribution of the two phases in the transition region. In this latter scenario, as the applied pressure is increased in the transition region, the amount of the high pressure phase grows at the expense of the low pressure phase, until the sample is completely transformed into the high pressure phase at the end of the transition region. The markedly similar features in the T_{c} versus pressure diagrams shown in Fig. 3 for the two compounds LnO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} (Ln = La, Ce) suggests that this behavior could be characteristic in general of the entire class of LnO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} materials.

One possible explanation for this behavior is that there is a distribution of pressures at which the transformation between the two phases takes place within the transition region. This distribution could be associated with some type of inhomogeneity (either electronic or atomic) in the samples. Experiments are currently in progress to search for a possible pressure-induced structural transition in these materials and to see whether the pressure-induced transition can be sharpened by improving the synthesis methods. The synthesis of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} under pressure with a T_{c} of 10.6 K suggests the possibility that the transformation pressure between the low and high pressure phases can be reduced to zero pressure by using a different synthesis route.[10]

## IV Summary

We have observed a striking enhancement of superconductivity accompanying the suppression of semiconducting behavior with pressure in the LnO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compounds (Ln = La, Ce) at critical pressures of \sim1.1 GPa and \sim2.0 GPa for Ln = La and Ce, respectively. There is markedly similar behavior in the electrical resistivity measurements under applied pressure for these two BiS_{2}-based superconductors LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}. Electrical resistivity measurements reveal that for both compounds, the suppression of their semiconducting behavior is hysteretic upon application of pressure. The semiconducting behavior of the electrical resistivity is consistent with two energy gaps that are suppressed with pressure in a similar way. The pressure dependence of the electrical resistivity exhibits hysteresis below a critical pressure where there is a change in slope of log(\rho) vs P and where the maximum value of T_{c} is observed. Furthermore, for both compounds, we have discovered a continuous and reversible transient region between regions of low and high T_{c}, which is characterized by a broadening of the superconducting transition; however, the mechanism behind the broadening of the superconducting transitions between the lower and higher T_{c} regions is unclear. The broadening could be a simple consequence of the sensitive pressure dependence of T_{c} in this region, which, when coupled with even a modest pressure gradient, could result in broader measured superconducting transitions. Sample inhomogeneity might also be responsible for the distribution of transition pressures seen in the broadening region, and the possibility of pressure-induced structural phase transitions is currently being investigated with x-ray diffraction measurements under pressure. Given the striking similarity in behavior for these two BiS_{2}-based superconductors, further electrical resistivity measurements under pressure on other compounds could point to characteristic behavior of BiS_{2}-based superconductors in general.

In experiments currently underway we have observed the same qualitative behavior for the NdO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and PrO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compounds as were observed in the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compounds suggesting this is indeed a general phenomenon in the class of LnO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compounds. Our results on the NdO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compound may be compared to the recently reported study of NdO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} specimens prepared in a solid state reaction by Selvan _et al.[16]_ For the compounds with Ln = La, Ce, and Pr, there is a dramatic decrease in the electrical resistivity with pressure that reflects a continuous suppression of semiconducting behavior. Although the temperature coefficient of the electrical resistivity d\rho/dT at the highest pressures is small for these Ln = La, Ce, and Pr compounds, the coefficient nevertheless remains negative (d\rho/dT<0), so that we cannot definitely conclude that the metallic state has been achieved. We have, however, been able to reach a metallic state for Ln = Nd, indicated by a positive temperature coefficient of resistivity (d\rho/dT>0), consistent with a semiconductor-metal transition. Experiments to pressures in excess of 3 GPa are currently underway to see if definitive metallic states (i.e., d\rho/dT>0) can be attained for the Ln = La, Ce, and Pr compounds.

###### Abstract

Electrical resistivity measurements as a function of temperature between 1 and 300 K were performed at various pressures up to 3 GPa on the superconducting layered compounds _Ln_O_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 (_Ln_ = La, Ce). At atmospheric pressure, LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 have superconducting critical temperatures _T_c of 3.3 and 2.3 K, respectively. For both compounds, the superconducting critical temperature _T_c initially increases, reaches a maximum value of 10.1 K for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 and 6.7 K for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2, and then gradually decreases with increasing pressure. Both samples also exhibit transient behavior in the region between the lower _T_c phase near atmospheric pressure and the higher _T_c phase at higher pressures. This region is characterized by a broadening of the superconducting transition, in which _T_c and the transition width \Delta_T_c are reversible with increasing and decreasing pressure. There is also an appreciable pressure-induced and hysteretic suppression of semiconducting behavior up to the pressure at which the maximum value of _T_c is found. At pressures above the value at which the maximum in _T_c occurs, there is a gradual decrease of _T_c and further suppression of the semiconducting behavior with pressure, both of which are reversible.

## I Introduction

Superconductivity with a superconducting critical temperature _T_c = 8.6 K has recently been reported in the layered compound Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}.^{1,2} Following this report, other BiS2-based superconductors including _Ln_O_{1-x}F_{x}BiS2 (_Ln_ = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb) with a _T_c as high as 10.6 K have been synthesized and studied.^{3,4-12} More recent work demonstrates that chemical substitution of the tetravalent ions Th^{+4}, Hf^{+4}, Zr^{+4}, and Ti^{+4} for trivalent lanthanum, La^{+3}, in LaOBiS2 increases the charge-carrier density and induces superconductivity.^{13} Most of the research on the layered BiS2 compounds has heretofore centered on the effect of chemical substitution on superconductivity. Application of an external pressure may also be employed as a method for reducing the unit cell volume of these compounds and studying the resultant effect on superconductivity. In this paper, we report measurements of the pressure dependence of the normal state electrical resistivity between 1 and 300 K and _T_c at various pressures up to \sim3 GPa for the compounds LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2. We compare our results to recently reported studies of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 samples synthesized under high pressure by Kotegawa _et al.^{7}_

The qualitative evolution of _T_c with pressure is markedly similar for both LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2, which have _T_c values (at atmospheric pressure) of 3.3 and 2.2 K, respectively. For both compounds, _T_c initially increases, reaches a maximum value of 10.1 K at \sim1 GPa for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 and 6.7 K at \sim2 GPa for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2, and then gradually decreases with increasing pressure. Both compounds also exhibit striking transient behavior in the region between the lower _T_c phase near atmospheric pressure and the higher _T_c phase at higher pressures. This transient region is characterized by a rapid increase of _T_c and an increase of the superconducting transition width \Delta_T_c, in which both _T_c and \Delta_T_c are reversible with increasing and decreasing pressure cycles. This occurs over a range in pressure from \sim0.5 to 1.1 GPa for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 and from \sim0.5 to 1.5 GPa for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2. In both materials, there is a sizable pressure-induced suppression of semiconducting behavior exhibiting hysteresis up to the pressure at which the maximum value of _T_c is found. The rapid increase of the charge carrier density inferred from the suppression of the semiconducting behavior correlates with the rapid increase of _T_c in this region. At pressures above the value at which the maximum in _T_c occurs, there is a gradual decrease of _T_c and further suppression of the semiconducting behavior with pressure, both of which are reversible.

## II Experimental Details

Polycrystalline samples of _Ln_O_{1-x}F_{x}BiS2 (_Ln_ = La, Ce) with x = 0.5 were prepared by solid-state reaction using powders of La_{2}O_{3} (99.9%), LaF_{3} (99.9%), La_{2}S_{3} (99.9%) and Bi_{2}S_{3} (99.9%) for LaO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS2, and powders of CeF_{3} (99.9%) and CeO_{2} (99.9%) for CeO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS2. Bi_{2}S3 precursor powder was prepared in an evacuated quartz tube by reacting Bi (99.99%) and S (99.9%) at 500 degC for 10 hours. The _Ln_2S_{3} (_Ln_ = La, Ce) precursor powders were prepared in an evacuated quartz tube by reacting chunks of La and Ce with S grains at 800 degC for 12 hours. The starting materials with nominal composition _Ln_O_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 (_Ln_ = La, Ce) were weighed, thoroughly mixed, pressed into pellets, sealed in evacuated quartz tubes, and annealed at 800 degC for 10 hours. The products were then ground, mixed for homogenization, pressed into pellets, and annealed again in evacuated quartz tubes at 800 degC for 10 hours. X-ray powder diffraction measurements were made using an x-ray diffractometer with a Cu K_{\alpha} source to assess phase purity and to determine the crystal structure of the _Ln_O_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 (_Ln_ = La, Ce) compounds. Lattice parameters for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 are a = 4.0613 A and c = 13.3157 A, while for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS2 the lattice parameters are a = 4.0398 A and c = 13.4513 A.^{12}  Measurements of \rho(T) under applied pressure were performed up to \sim3 GPa in a clamped piston cylinder pressure cell between \sim1 and 300 K in a pumped ^{4}He dewar. A 1:1 by volume mixture of n-pentane and isoamyl alcohol was used to provide a quasihydrostatic pressure transmitting medium. A second set of electrical resistivity measurements were performed by releasing pressure from the pressurized cell down to atmospheric pressure. Annealed Pt leads were affixed to gold-sputtered contact surfaces on each sample with silver epoxy in a standard four-wire configuration. The pressure dependent superconducting T_{c} of high purity Sn, measured inductively, was used as a manometer and calibrated against data from Ref. [14].

## III Results and discussion

The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity \rho below 300 K for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} at various pressures is displayed in Fig. 1. Figure 1(a) shows \rho(T) upon increasing pressure to 3.1 GPa, while Fig. 1(b) gives \rho(T) upon decreasing pressure back down to 0.31 GPa. The temperature dependence of \rho(T) at lower pressures exhibits semiconducting behavior. The semiconducting behavior is suppressed with increasing pressure as seen from the nearly constant \rho(T) curves above 2 GPa. A comparison of Fig. 1(a) with Fig. 1(b) shows that the suppression of \rho(T) is continuous and reversible over the full range 0.3-3.1 GPa. At pressures above 2 GPa where suppression is greatest, the values of \rho(T) are comparable in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) and reversible with pressure. However, whereas the suppression of \rho(T) is reversible with pressure, the magnitude of \rho(T) exhibits hysteretic behavior with pressure. At lower pressures, measurements of \rho(T) made during release of pressure yield higher values than \rho(T) measurements performed upon increasing pressure. The difference between \rho(T) measurements made during increasing pressure and those made during decreasing pressure

  are largest at lower pressures where the rate of suppression of semiconducting behavior is largest. After a release in pressure to the lowest value of 0.31 GPa, the maximum value of \rho is nearly 14 m\Omega cm. This is a factor of 2 larger than the corresponding value along the increasing pressure path at 0.34 GPa.

Superconducting transitions at low temperature were measured upon increasing and then releasing pressure as shown in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d), respectively. There is a striking similarity in the qualitative behavior and evolution of the transitions in both plots. For pressures in the range 0.5 to 1.0 GPa, the superconducting transitions broaden significantly. For higher pressures above 1.0 GPa, the transition curves begin to sharpen again at approximately 10 K. It is in this higher pressure region where T_{c} passes through a maximum of 10.1 K at \sim1 GPa and then gradually decreases as pressure increases. The evolution of both the value of the superconducting critical temperature T_{c} and the superconducting transition \Delta T_{c} defined by the procedure described in the text, were reversible with respect to both increasing and decreasing pressure. T_{c} was defined as the temperature at which \rho falls to 50% of its value at the temperature of the onset of superconductivity T_{c}^{\rm onset} with T_{c}^{\rm onset} determined as illustrated in Fig. 1(c). The temperature where the resistivity vanishes T_{0} was determined in a similar fashion as T_{c}^{\rm onset} using a linear extrapolation of the resistive superconducting curve to \rho = 0. In determining T_{c} for the broader transitions, we used the same criteria as for the sharper transitions; however, we make note of the less definitive T_{c} for these broader transitions.

Measurements performed on CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} reveal remarkably similar behavior to the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} results. As shown in Fig. 2, the qualitative behavior of the results are reversible upon application and release of pressure. Measurements of \rho(T) show semiconducting behavior which is suppressed at higher pressures. As pressure is released, the semiconducting behavior is recovered. The measured values of \rho(T) are higher along the reversed path during a release of pressure. The discrepancy between \rho(T) measurements made

At lower pressures, the compound exhibits semiconducting behavior. The semiconducting behavior is suppressed at higher pressure as seen from the flattening of the curves. (c), (d) Resistive superconducting transition curves for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} at various pressures upon (c) increasing and (d) decreasing pressure. T_{c} increases from 2.3 K to a maximum of 6.7 K and then gradually decreases.

  during increasing pressure and those made during decreasing pressure are largest at lower pressures where the rate of suppression of the semiconducting behavior is largest. After releasing the pressure to the lowest value of 0.31 GPa, \rho is nearly 130 m\Omega cm; this is a factor of 1.5 larger than the corresponding value along the increasing pressure path at 0.34 GPa.

Superconducting transitions at low temperature were measured for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} while increasing and then decreasing pressure. The trend and character of the transitions are reversible upon application and subsequent release of pressure as seen from a comparison of Figs. 2(c) and 2(d). Similar to the evolution of T_{c} in LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, sharp superconducting transitions are observed at low pressures up to approximately 0.5 GPa before they begin to broaden. From both the increasing and decreasing pressure plots [Figs. 2(c) and 2(d), respectively], the transitions begin to broaden significantly up to pressures of approximately 1.5 GPa. At pressures above 1.5 GPa, the superconducting transitions become sharp again. It is in this pressure region where T_{c} passes through a maximum of 6.7 K at \sim2 GPa and then decreases gradually at higher pressures.

Figure 3 summarizes the results for the superconducting phase diagram T_{c}(P) for both the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compounds. The measurements were performed first by increasing the pressure monotonically in six steps (filled symbols) up to 3.1 GPa, followed by a monotonic decrease in pressure in nine steps (open symbols) back down to 0.31 GPa. The phase diagram indicates T_{c}(P) is highly reversible for both compounds; negligible pressure hysteresis is observed even in the regions where the resistive transition broadens significantly.

The phase diagram in Fig. 3 shows T_{c} maxima for both the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compounds. In the case of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, T_{c} initially increases with pressure up to a maximum of 10.1 K at 1.1 GPa. T_{c} then gradually decreases with a slope of -0.30 K GPa^{-1}. This T_{c} maximum is also preceded by a reversible broadening of the superconducting transition in the pressure range 0.5-1.0 GPa, represented as elongated vertical bars in Fig. 3. In the normal state [above the T_{c}(P) curve], the semiconducting behavior of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} is continuously suppressed with pressure as manifested in an energy gap \Delta_{1} that decreases with pressure, the values of which are indicated in the legend. The determination of the energy gaps \Delta_{1} and \Delta_{2} from the \rho(T,P) data are discussed below. This maximum in T_{c}(P) at 1.1 GPa occurs in the vicinity of a change of slope in the normal state log(\rho) vs P relation, measured at 11 K, as shown in Fig. 4.

In the case of CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, T_{c} initially increases to a maximum of 6.7 K at \sim2 GPa and then decreases slowly with a slope of -0.30 K GPa^{-1} at higher pressures. Leading up to this maximum is a reversible broadening of the superconducting transition in the region 0.5-1.5 GPa depicted by the lengthened vertical bars in Fig. 3. In the normal state [above the T_{c}(P) curve], the semiconducting behavior of CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} is also continuously suppressed with pressure as manifested in an energy gap \Delta_{1} that decreases with pressure, the values of which are indicated in the legend. The maximum in T_{c}(P) at 2 GPa also occurs in the vicinity of a slope change in log(\rho) vs P, measured at 7.6 K, as shown in Fig. 4.

The width of the superconducting transitions in the broadening region, represented by the length of the vertical bars in Fig. 3, is \Delta T_{c}\sim4-6 K. Pressure gradients in the piston-cylinder cell were estimated from the error in pressure to be of the order \Delta P\sim\pm 0.05 GPa where the error in pressure was determined from the width of the superconducting transition of the Sn manometer. It is possible to relate \Delta T_{c} and \Delta P through the slope of T_{c}(P) in Fig. 3 so that \Delta T_{c}\simeq(dT_{c}(P)/dP)\Delta P. Even though \Delta P is small

Figure 3: (Color online) Phase diagrams for (a) LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and (b) CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} under pressure. T_{c} was defined as the temperature at which the electrical resistivity \rho falls to 50% of its value at the temperature of the onset of superconductivity T_{c}^{\rm onset}. The length of the vertical bars indicate the superconducting transition width \Delta T_{c} and vertical bar caps indicate T_{c}^{\rm onset} (upper) and T_{0} (lower). Filled symbols denote measurements performed upon increasing pressure, while open symbols represent measurements made upon decreasing pressure. The solid black curves are guides to the eye. The change in color in the semiconducting normal state region represents the suppression of the semiconducting behavior with pressure as manifested in the decrease of the energy gap \Delta_{1} whose values are indicated in the legend.

  and constant for pressures measured as part of this study, \Delta T_{c} can be large when dT_{c}(P)/dP is large (i.e., in the pressure region where broadened transitions are observed). Rough estimates of \Delta T_{c} were made using \Delta P = 0.1 GPa and slopes of 18 and 11 K/GPa for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, respectively. These calculations yield values of \Delta T_{c} = 1.8 and 1.1 K for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, respectively, which are of the correct order of magnitude. The size of the vertical bars characterizing \Delta T_{c} also appear to qualitatively track with the local slope of T_{c}(P) for most pressures in Fig. 3.

Kotegawa _et al._[7] previously reported the pressure dependence of T_{c} for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} samples synthesized under high pressure, which apparently exhibit only the high T_{c} phase uncovered in the present study. In their experiments, it was found that T_{c} exhibits a maximum of 10.6 K at \sim1 GPa and then gradually decreases with a slope of -0.40 K/GPa (compared to -0.30 K/GPa in this study) at pressures above 1 GPa. The low T_{c} phase and broadened superconducting transitions bridging the low T_{c} and high T_{c} phases, however, are not present in their T_{c}(P) phase diagram. The presence of only the high T_{c} phase at ambient pressure in the study by Kotegawa _et al._[7] suggests that synthesis of the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} samples under high pressure has already induced the high T_{c} superconducting phase.

From the plot of log(\rho) vs P at low temperature displayed in Fig. 4, there is a noticeable change in the magnitude of the suppression rate dlog(\rho)/dP for both the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compounds. In the case of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, there is a strong suppression of resistivity up to \sim1.2 GPa, followed by a weaker suppression at higher pressures. In the case of CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, there is a strong suppression of resistivity up to \sim1.8 GPa, followed by a weaker suppression at higher pressures. The \rho(P) data for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} were taken in the normal state at 11 and 7.6 K, respectively. These temperatures occur just above the onset of the superconducting transition at T_{c}^{\rm onset}. The dotted lines in Fig. 4 are guides to the eye for the rates of suppression of log(\rho) with pressure.

There is a correlation between the pressure at which the maximum T_{c} occurs in the T_{c}(P) phase diagram of Fig. 3 and the pressure where the suppression rate changes in the plot of log(\rho) vs P in Fig. 4. For LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, this "critical pressure" occurs at \sim1.2 GPa, while for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} it is located at \sim1.8 GPa. In both compounds, there is also an apparent pressure hysteresis as seen from the separation between the increasing pressure data (open symbols) and the decreasing pressure data (filled symbols). This pressure hysteresis becomes more pronounced where the suppression rate is higher, i.e., below the previously mentioned critical pressures.

The semiconducting behavior of the \rho(T) data and its rapid suppression with pressure was noted in the work of Kotegawa _et al._[7] on the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compound synthesized under high pressure. They observed that the resistivity could be described over two distinct regions by the relation

\[\rho(T)=\rho_{0}e^{\Delta/2k_{B}T},\] (1)

where \rho_{0} is a constant and \Delta is an energy gap. Analysis of the \rho(T) data at atmospheric pressure in these two regions, 200-300 K and T_{c}-20 K, yielded energy gaps \Delta_{1}/k_{B}\approx 140 and \Delta_{2}/k_{B}\approx 1.86 K, respectively. Both energy gaps \Delta_{1} and \Delta_{2} were found to decrease with pressure. In this study, we have also determined values of the energy gaps \Delta_{1} and \Delta_{2} from linear fits of \rho(T) data on a plot of log(\rho) vs 1/T, as illustrated in Fig. 5, which displays our \rho(T) data for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} upon increasing pressure. From similar plots for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} upon decreasing pressure as well as for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} upon increasing and decreasing pressure, the

Electrical resistivity values for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} were taken at T = 7.6 K, while \rho values for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} were taken at T = 11 K.

The break in slope occurs at a pressure near that at which T_{c} reaches a maximum for both LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}.

  two energy gaps \Delta_{1} and \Delta_{2}, corresponding to the high and low temperature regions, respectively, could also be extracted.

The behavior of energy gaps \Delta_{1} and \Delta_{2} as a function of pressure for both LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} are shown in Fig. 6. The energy gaps decrease rapidly with pressure, similar to the behavior observed by Kotegawa _et al._[7] However, it is interesting to note that the values of the energy gaps for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} at atmospheric pressure shown in Fig. 6 are considerably larger than the values obtained by Kotegawa _et al._[7] The energy gaps \Delta_{1} and \Delta_{2} both exhibit hysteretic behavior below a critical pressure of \sim1.3 GPa for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and \sim2 GPa for CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}; these critical pressures correlate with the pressures where the slope dlog(\rho)/d P changes (at temperatures in the normal state right above T_{c}) in the log(\rho) vs P plots [Fig. 4]) and also correlate with the transition pressures into the high T_{c} phase for both LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} [Fig. 3].

Specific heat C(T) measurements at ambient pressure have recently been made on both the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compounds.[12] The samples in Ref. [12] and in the present study were from the same batch. In the case of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, these C(T) measurements suggest that the superconductivity observed at \sim3 K for pressures less than \sim0.5 GPa is a bulk phenomenon. In Fig. 5 of Ref. [12], there is a clear jump in C(T)/T at T_{c} = 2.93 K. This value of T_{c} is close to the temperature where \rho vanishes in LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}. We expect, therefore, that the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} sample in this study exhibits bulk superconductivity at lower pressures.

It is still unclear whether or not the higher T_{c} superconducting transitions at pressures above 0.5 GPa are associated with bulk superconductivity. The narrow widths of the superconducting transitions would seem to suggest that the superconductivity in this pressure range is a bulk phenomenon. However, the sharpness of the resistive transitions is also consistent with a filamentary zero resistance path through the sample with a narrow distribution of T_{c} values that could be due to small amounts of a superconducting phase, rather than bulk superconductivity. High pressure magnetization

Energy gaps were fitted with Eq. (1) using the data shown in Fig. 5. Filled (open) symbols were obtained upon increasing (decreasing) pressure cycles.

  measurements in a SQUID magnetometer were performed on several pieces of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} to determine the character of the 10 K superconducting phase by Taufour, Bud'ko, and Canfield.[15] It was difficult to observe a diamagnetic signal against the large background from the pressure cell. This suggests possible inhomogeneity in the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} sample.

In the case of CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, however, there is no indication in the ambient pressure C(T) measurements of bulk superconductivity.[12] The lack of a discernible jump in specific heat, however, could be due to sample inhomogeneity and/or the proximity of T_{c} = 1.9 K to the base temperature T = 1.8 K of the specific heat measurements and needs to be investigated further.

The rapid increase of T_{c} and broadening of the superconducting transition with pressure, as well as its reversibility with pressure for both compounds, suggest the existence of a gradual, pressure-induced transition between superconducting phases with a lower T_{c} at lower pressure and a higher T_{c} at higher pressure. The broadening of the superconducting transition feature in the transition region, \sim1 GPa wide for both compounds, could be a consequence of the large slope of T_{c}(P) in that pressure range [i.e., \Delta T_{c}\simeq(dT_{c}(P)/dP)\Delta P]. It might also be due to a spatial distribution of the two phases in the transition region. In this latter scenario, as the applied pressure is increased in the transition region, the amount of the high pressure phase grows at the expense of the low pressure phase, until the sample is completely transformed into the high pressure phase at the end of the transition region. The markedly similar features in the T_{c} versus pressure diagrams shown in Fig. 3 for the two compounds LnO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} (Ln = La, Ce) suggests that this behavior could be characteristic in general of the entire class of LnO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} materials.

One possible explanation for this behavior is that there is a distribution of pressures at which the transformation between the two phases takes place within the transition region. This distribution could be associated with some type of inhomogeneity (either electronic or atomic) in the samples. Experiments are currently in progress to search for a possible pressure-induced structural transition in these materials and to see whether the pressure-induced transition can be sharpened by improving the synthesis methods. The synthesis of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} under pressure with a T_{c} of 10.6 K suggests the possibility that the transformation pressure between the low and high pressure phases can be reduced to zero pressure by using a different synthesis route.[10]

## IV Summary

We have observed a striking enhancement of superconductivity accompanying the suppression of semiconducting behavior with pressure in the LnO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compounds (Ln = La, Ce) at critical pressures of \sim1.1 GPa and \sim2.0 GPa for Ln = La and Ce, respectively. There is markedly similar behavior in the electrical resistivity measurements under applied pressure for these two BiS_{2}-based superconductors LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}. Electrical resistivity measurements reveal that for both compounds, the suppression of their semiconducting behavior is hysteretic upon application of pressure. The semiconducting behavior of the electrical resistivity is consistent with two energy gaps that are suppressed with pressure in a similar way. The pressure dependence of the electrical resistivity exhibits hysteresis below a critical pressure where there is a change in slope of log(\rho) vs P and where the maximum value of T_{c} is observed. Furthermore, for both compounds, we have discovered a continuous and reversible transient region between regions of low and high T_{c}, which is characterized by a broadening of the superconducting transition; however, the mechanism behind the broadening of the superconducting transitions between the lower and higher T_{c} regions is unclear. The broadening could be a simple consequence of the sensitive pressure dependence of T_{c} in this region, which, when coupled with even a modest pressure gradient, could result in broader measured superconducting transitions. Sample inhomogeneity might also be responsible for the distribution of transition pressures seen in the broadening region, and the possibility of pressure-induced structural phase transitions is currently being investigated with x-ray diffraction measurements under pressure. Given the striking similarity in behavior for these two BiS_{2}-based superconductors, further electrical resistivity measurements under pressure on other compounds could point to characteristic behavior of BiS_{2}-based superconductors in general.

In experiments currently underway we have observed the same qualitative behavior for the NdO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and PrO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compounds as were observed in the LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and CeO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compounds suggesting this is indeed a general phenomenon in the class of LnO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compounds. Our results on the NdO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} compound may be compared to the recently reported study of NdO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} specimens prepared in a solid state reaction by Selvan _et al.[16]_ For the compounds with Ln = La, Ce, and Pr, there is a dramatic decrease in the electrical resistivity with pressure that reflects a continuous suppression of semiconducting behavior. Although the temperature coefficient of the electrical resistivity d\rho/dT at the highest pressures is small for these Ln = La, Ce, and Pr compounds, the coefficient nevertheless remains negative (d\rho/dT<0), so that we cannot definitely conclude that the metallic state has been achieved. We have, however, been able to reach a metallic state for Ln = Nd, indicated by a positive temperature coefficient of resistivity (d\rho/dT>0), consistent with a semiconductor-metal transition. Experiments to pressures in excess of 3 GPa are currently underway to see if definitive metallic states (i.e., d\rho/dT>0) can be attained for the Ln = La, Ce, and Pr compounds.
