###### Abstract

The superconducting state of the filled skutterudite alloy series Pr1-_x_La,Pt_{4}Ge_{12} has been systematically studied by specific heat and zero-field muon spin relaxation (\muSR), while the critical fields have been determined by magnetization measurements. An additional inhomogeneous local magnetic field, indicative of broken time-reversal symmetry, is observed in the superconducting states of the alloys. For x\lesssim 0.5, the broken-TRS phase sets in below a temperature T_{m}, distinctly lower than the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}. For x\gtrsim 0.5, T_{m}\approx T_{c}. The local field strength decreases as x\to 1, where LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is characterized by conventional pairing. The lower critical field H_{c1}(T) of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} shows the onset of a second quadratic temperature region below T_{q}\sim T_{m}. Upper critical field H_{c2}(T) measurements suggest multiband superconductivity, and point gap nodes are consistent with the specific heat data. In Pr1-_x_La,Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, only a single specific-heat discontinuity is observed at T_{c}, in contrast to the second jump seen in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} below T_{c}. These results suggest that superconductivity in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} is characterized by a complex order parameter.

## I Introduction

The study of novel superconductors with intrinsic multiple superconducting phases has broadened the understanding of the microscopic origin of unconventional superconductivity (SC) [1,2]. A particular challenge is to clearly identify multiple SC phases in unconventional superconductors and to interpret their SC order parameter(s) (OP).

Gauge symmetry is always broken in the superconducting state. A key indication of multiphase SC is the observation of additional broken symmetry [time-reversal symmetry (TRS), inversion symmetry] at a distinct temperature T_{m} below the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}. However, superconductors with intrinsic multiple SC phases are extremely rare. T_{c}\sim T_{m} for many superconductors with broken TRS, such as Sr_{2}RuO_{4}[3], LaNiC_{2}[4], SrPtAs [5], and Re{\rm\acute{e}}Zr [6]. Empirically, superconductors with 4f or 5f electron elements are likely to have complex SC OPs [1,7] that can possibly lead to the emergence of multiple SC phases. For example, superconducting U_{1-x}Th_{x}Be_{13}[8] and UPt_{3}[9] were found to exhibit broken TRS at T_{m}<T_{c}, which suggests the existence of a second SC phase below T_{m}. The unusual properties of these heavy fermion (HF) superconductors have led to theories that invoke odd-parity (spin-triplet) Cooper pairing [2].

Of particular interest in the small family of multiphase superconductors is the puzzling SC OP of the filled-skutterudite f-electron compound PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}[10], which exhibits broken TRS [11]. Several thermodynamic experiments show evidence for two SC transitions [12,13] in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, although T_{m} is not clearly below the upper T_{c}=1.85 K in muon spin relaxation (\muSR) experiments [11] and it has been argued [14] that the double T_{c} nature is not intrinsic. The SC OP of PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} is a consequence of crystalline-electric-field and strong spin-orbital coupling (SOC) effects [10], and is complicated by the low T_{c} and HF behavior.

The isostructural compound PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, with a smaller electron effective mass m^{*}, is considered to share great similarity with PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} in the pairing state [15,16], although no multiple SC phases have been reported. The much higher T_{c}\sim 7.8 K and non-HF state makes PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} a simpler playground to study SC in Pr-based filled skutterudites. Then the key question is whether the OP in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} is complex, including the possibility of a spin-triplet state and broken TRS [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].

The pairing symmetry of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} remains controversial. The observed broken TRS suggests an OP with either spin or orbital moments [17]. Thermodynamic studies reported the presence of pointlike nodes in the SC energy gap [15]. Superfluid density measurements by transverse-field \muSR [16] suggest a nonunitary chiral p-wave state with gap function \Delta_{0}|k_{x}\pm ik_{y}|, where \Delta_{0} is the magnitude of the gap. These experimental observations motivated theoretical predictions of spin-nondegenerate nodal quasiparticle excitations due to strong SOC [22]. On the other hand, the T_{c}s of the La-doped series compounds are quite close and they vary continuously, with both end compounds being two-band superconductor candidates [21]. This indicates that the OPs of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} could be compatible. The observation of a Hebel-Slichter coherence peak [23] below T_{c} in the ^{73}Ge NMR relaxation rate in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[18] is evidence of weakly coupled conventional pairing. The situation is clearly quite fluid.

In this paper, we argue that unconventional SC with a complex OP in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} is favored by our doping study of Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9, using measurements of specific heats, superconducting critical fields determined by magnetization measurements, and muon spin relaxation (\muSR) in zero and longitudinal [24] fields (ZF- and LF-\muSR, respectively) [25, 26, 27]. Broken TRS in superconductors often results in an inhomogeneous local magnetic field **B**loc below T_{c}, which can be readily detected by ZF-\muSR experiments. The width \delta B_{s} of this field distribution is roughly \Delta_{e}/\gamma_{\mu}, where \Delta_{e} is the contribution of the field distribution to the static Gaussian muon spin relaxation rate \Delta and \gamma_{\mu}/2\pi = 135.53 MHz/T is the muon gyromagnetic ratio [3, 11]. We find broken TRS in all samples, with a continuous decrease of \delta B_{s} with increasing La doping. LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is a conventional superconductor [21, 28]. Intriguingly, T_{m} is clearly lower than T_{c} for x\lesssim 0.5, and T_{c}-T_{m} is significant in Pr-rich alloys (\sim1 K in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}). The temperature dependence of the lower critical field H_{c1}(T) shows an anomaly at a temperature T_{q}\sim T_{m} in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}: H_{c1}\propto T^{2} both above and below T_{q}, but with an increased coefficient below this temperature. The upper critical field H_{c2}(T) of Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.7, is well described by a two-band SC model. We find evidence for point gap nodes in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} from specific heat data, but no second SC jump in the specific heat at \simT_{m} in any of the measured alloys. Our results indicate a multicomponent SC OP in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, which results in intrinsic multiple SC phases.

## II Sample characterization and experimental methods

### Sample preparation

Synthesis procedures for our polycrystalline Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} samples (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9) were similar to those described in Refs. [15, 29]. The body-centered-cubic structure (point group T_{h}, space group Im\bar{3}) was confirmed by Rietveld refinements of powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. The observed isostructural linear expansion of lattice constant a with La concentration x (Fig. 1) is consistent with Vegard's law. No obvious Pr/La occupation defect is found.

### Specific heat

Measurements of the specific heat C_{p} of the samples were performed using a standard thermal relaxation technique in a commercial PPMS EverCool-II device (Quantum Design). Measurements on the x = 0.3 and 0.7 samples were also carried out in a dilution refrigerator. The sample surfaces were polished flat to make good thermal contact. The Debye-Sommerfeld approximation C_{p}=C_{e}+C_{\rm ph}=\gamma_{e}T+\beta_{\rm ph}T^{3} was fit to the normal-state specific heat, measured in a magnetic field of 3 T over the temperature range 2-10 K. The Debye temperature was obtained from the relation \theta_{D}=(12\pi^{4}N_{\rm a}nk_{B}/5\beta_{\rm ph})^{1/3}, where N_{\rm a} is Avogadro's number, n is the number of atoms per formula unit, and k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant.

For Pr_{0.7}La_{0.3}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, an upturn in the temperature dependence of C_{p} below \sim0.5 K was observed, due to a Schottky contribution [30]C_{\rm Sch}\propto T^{-2} from quadrupole-split ^{14}Pr nuclei (data not shown). The fit gives C_{\rm Sch}(T)/\gamma_{e}=0.0015(3)\ T^{-2} K, which was subtracted to obtain C_{e} of Pr_{0.7}La_{0.3}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. A Schottky anomaly was also reported in the parent compound PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[16], but is not observed in Pr_{0.3}La_{0.7}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} down to 0.1 K. It is possible that there is Schottky contribution in the low-temperature C_{p}, but it is small due to diluted ^{141}Pr nuclei and thus hard to fit and be subtracted from C_{p}.

### Magnetic susceptibility

Susceptibility measurements were carried out using a commercial vibrating sample magnetometer (Quantum Design) down to 2 K. Upper critical fields H_{c2} were taken as the onset of the superconducting magnetization M_{s}(H,T) in field-cooled experiments. Lower critical fields H_{c1} were determined from the field dependence of M_{s}(H,T) measured after cooling in "zero" field (less than \sim0.3 mT). H_{c1} was defined typically as the field value where the magnetization deviates from the field shielding initial slope. Figure 2 shows the determination of H_{c1} at several representative temperatures. Results are discussed in Sec. III.2.

### \muSr

In time-differential \muSR [25, 26, 27], spin-polarized muons are implanted into the sample and decay via the weak interaction: \mu^{\pm}\to e^{\pm}+\bar{\nu}_{\mu}(\nu_{\mu})+\nu_{e}(\bar{\nu}_{e}). The decay positron (electron) count rate asymmetry A_{\mu}(t) in a given direction is proportional to the muon ensemble spin polarization P_{\mu}(t) in that direction, and yields information on static and dynamic local fields at the muon sites. Positive muons (\mu^{+}), which stop at interstitial sites in solids, are generally used because they sample local magnetism better than negative muons, which are tightly bound to nuclei.

\muSR experiments were carried out on samples with x = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 using the MUSR spectrometer at the ISIS Neutron and Muon Facility, Rutherford Appleton

  Laboratory, Chilton, United Kingdom, over the temperature range 0.3-12 K. The ambient magnetic field was actively compensated to better than 1 \muT. The ZF-\muSR data for the parent compound PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} discussed in this paper are from Ref. [20].

The observed ZF and LF asymmetry time spectra A_{\mu}(t)=a_{0}P_{\mu}(t), where a_{0} is the initial asymmetry, are well described by the exponentially damped Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe polarization function [31] plus a background signal from the silver sample holder with a weighing factor f_{\mu}1.

Footnote 1: Data from Ref. [15].

\[P_{\mu}(t)=f_{\mu}e^{-\lambda t}G_{F}^{\rm{KT}}(\Delta,t)+(1-f_{\mu})P_{\rm{Ag}},\] (1)

where F= ZF or LF, \Delta/\gamma_{\mu} is the rms width of a Gaussian distribution of static local fields, and the damping rate \lambda is often interpreted as a dynamic relaxation rate due to thermal fluctuations of the muon local field [32]. Here

\[G_{\rm{ZF}}^{\rm{KT}}(\Delta,t)=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{3}(1-\Delta^{2}t^{2})\exp \big{(}-\frac{1}{2}\Delta^{2}t^{2}\big{)}\] (2)

and

\[G_{\rm{LF}}^{\rm{KT}}(\Delta_{\rm{LF}},t) = 1-\frac{2\Delta_{\rm{LF}}^{2}}{\omega_{L}^{2}}\big{[}1-\exp\big{(} -\frac{1}{2}\Delta_{\rm{LF}}^{2}t^{2}\big{)}\cos(\omega_{L}t)\big{]}\] \[+\frac{2\Delta_{\rm{LF}}^{4}}{\omega_{L}^{3}}\int_{0}^{t}\exp \big{(}-\frac{1}{2}\Delta_{\rm{LF}}^{2}t^{2}\big{)}\sin(\omega_{L}\tau)\,d\tau,\]

where \omega_{L}=\gamma_{\mu}H_{L} is the muon Zeeman frequency in the longitudinal field H_{L}. Equations (1)-(3) have previously been used to analyze data from PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} and PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and their alloys [11, 17, 20, 33].

The last term P_{\rm{Ag}}=e^{-\lambda_{\rm{Ag}}t} in Eq. (1) is due to muons that miss the sample and stop in the silver sample holder. Measured silver relaxation rates \lambda_{\rm{Ag}} are sample dependent but very small (\sim0.1-10 ms^{-1}), with weak temperature and initial muon energy dependencies [34, 35]. This background signal is often considered as nonrelaxing (P_{\rm{Ag}}\sim 1) when sample relaxation is much larger. We here apply P_{\rm{Ag}}=1. Its fraction (1-f_{\mu}) is well determined using low-temperature \muSR asymmetry spectra, where the silver signal dominates the late-time data. Using a nonzero silver relaxation rate (10 ms^{-1}) does not change the fit results appreciably.

## III Results

The lattice constant a, superconducting transition temperatures T_{c}^{C_{\rho}} from the specific heat, Sommerfeld coefficients \gamma_{e}, Debye temperatures \theta_{D}, and the relative specific heat discontinuity \Delta C_{\rho}/\gamma_{e}T_{c} at T_{c} are summarized in Table 1, including data for the two end compounds (x=0 and 1) from Refs. [15, 16]. The quantity b is the coefficient in Eq. (8) of Sec. III.3.1, where \muSR relaxation data are analyzed assuming the contribution \Delta_{e}(T) to the static relaxation rate due to broken TRS exhibits a BCS gaplike temperature dependence.

\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c} x & a (Å) & T_{c} (K) & \gamma_{e} (mJ/mol K^{2}) & \Delta C_{\rho}/\gamma_{e}T_{c} & \theta_{D} (K) & b \\ \hline
0.01  & 8.6111(6) & 7.91 & 87.1 & 1.56 & 198 & 1.2(1) \\

0.5 & 8.6198(5  and 0.9, are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. There is only one obvious SC specific heat jump for all La concentrations, so that macroscopic separation of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} SC phases due to sample inhomogeneity is unlikely. The nonlinearity of the T_{c}/T dependence of \ln(C_{e}/\gamma_{e}T_{c}) for all measured samples [Fig. 3(a)] suggests structure in the superconducting gap [1, 29]. A simple power-law fit to C_{e} vs T (C_{e}\propto T^{n}) can give heuristic estimation of the gap symmetry, The values of the power n are displayed in Fig. 3(b). A \simT^{3}-dependent C_{e} suggests point gap nodes in x\neq 1 alloys. Also, the values of \Delta C_{p}/\gamma_{e}T_{c} for all measured samples are slightly larger than the BCS value of 1.43 [Fig. 3(c)], indicating unconventional SC.

The temperature dependencies of the specific heats for x=0.3 and 0.7 alloys down to T/T_{c}\approx 0.02 are displayed in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). For T<T_{c}, C_{e}(T) can be best described by the two-component "\alpha model" [37] with a weighting factor f:

\[C_{e}=fC_{e1}+(1-f)C_{e2}\,.\] (4)

This phenomenological model has been used to describe multiband superconductors such as MgB_{2}[38], and Eq. (4) with both C_{e1} and C_{e2} based on the BCS theory with different gaps was used to characterize LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}[21]. In Pr_{0.7}La_{0.3}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} and Pr_{0.3}La_{0.2}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, however, C_{e}(T) can be best fit using C_{e1}\propto e^{-\Delta_{1}/k_{B}T} and C_{e2}\propto T^{n}, which are empirical expressions for a full gap and a gap with nodes, respectively [1]. This parametrization results in f=0.17, n=2.91, and \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.33 for Pr_{0.7}La_{0.3}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}; and f=0.26, n=3.1, and \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.13 for Pr_{0.3}La_{0.7}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. The increase in f with increasing x suggests the gradual disappearance of the point-node gap as x increases, and for x=1, where TRS is fully restored, there is no power-law term (f=1) [28]. Other forms for C_{e1} and C_{e2} result in worse fit quality. Since specific heat of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} can be well fit by a two isotropic band model [21], fit of C_{e}(T) using two isotropic BCS gap functions could be used for comparison. For x=0.3, \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.05 and \Delta_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}=3.51, with f=0.31. For x=0.7, \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}=4.19 and \Delta_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.21, with f=0.77.

At low temperatures, a single fully gapped scenario does not yield the measured C_{e}(T) of either Pr_{0.7}La_{0.3}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} or Pr_{0.3}La_{0.7}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}; neither the asymptotic form [36]

\[\lim_{T\to 0}\frac{C_{e}}{\gamma_{e}T}=3.15\bigg{(}\frac{\Delta_{0}}{1.76k_{B}T }\bigg{)}^{5/2}\exp\bigg{(}-\frac{\Delta_{0}}{k_{B}T}\bigg{)}\] (5)

nor a simple exponential fit the data. The best fits to the data at low temperatures (0.1\,\mathrm{K}<T<0.3T_{c}) are to Eq. (4) with the low-temperature asymptotic form for C_{e1}(T) and a power law for C_{e2}(T) with n=3. Fits to weighted sums of T^{2} and T^{3} result in f\to 0 for T^{2}, precluding the possibility of line nodes in the gap. The goodness of fit for single power-law T^{3} fits is worse than for multicomponent fits.

We have summarized the fit results in Table 2. Our results suggest that Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} alloys are multiband superconductors, with one of the gap functions favoring pointlike nodes. But we cannot rule out the possibility of multiple isotropic gaps in x=0.3 and 0.7 alloys due to the close fit quality.

Our specific heat measurements in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} are in good agreement with previous work [15, 21, 16], except that reported values of the Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma_{e} for x=0 and 1 (Table 1) are somewhat higher than extrapolations from the alloys. Differences between reported values have been noted previously, and may be due to measurements at different fields and temperatures [29]. There is no evidence for sample differences based on comparison with published results [15, 29]; in particular, we do not observe the dramatic decrease in \gamma_{e} found in Pr_{0.5}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}[39] and attributed to Pr vacancies.

For all x, the values of \Delta C_{p}/\gamma_{e}T_{c} are slightly larger than the BCS value of 1.43.

  

### Critical fields

The origin of the difference between T_{m} and T_{c} has been further investigated by lower and upper critical field measurements. Results are shown in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5(a), we observe the possible existence of a second quadratic temperature dependence region below T_{q}\sim 6 K in H_{c1}(T) of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}. Within errors, T_{q} is close to the onset of broken TRS T_{m} (results shown later in Sec. III.3), but is slightly higher in a similar H_{c1}(T) study [40]. In contrast, H_{c2}(T) does not exhibit enhancement below T_{m}, but rather a smooth increase with decreasing temperature for all the measured Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} as shown in Figs. 5(b)-5(e).

The origins of H_{c1}(T) and H_{c2}(T) are different. H_{c1}(T) might provide a heuristic description of the gap symmetry, since in the London limit (coherence length \xi much smaller than the penetration depth \Lambda) [41]H_{c1}(T)/H_{c1}(0) is proportional to the superfluid density \rho_{s}\propto n_{s}/m^{*}[42]. For a fully gapped conventional superconductor such as pure niobium, H_{c1}(T)/H_{c1}(0)=1-(T/T_{c})^{2}[43]. The occurrence of the second quadratic temperature region thus indicates gap structure, possibly multiband structure or gap anisotropy.

Considering the onset of broken TRS at T_{m}, the extra enhancement of H_{c1}(T) below T_{q} could imply the occurrence of a distinct magnetic phase below T_{c} as in U_{1-x}Th_{x}Be_{13}[8]. Intriguingly, Ref. [16] showed that \rho_{s}/\rho_{0}(T/T_{c}) measured at 35 mT slightly deviates from other field results at T/T_{c}\sim 0.75 (close to T_{q}). This deviation was attributed to larger vortex disorder at fields close to H_{c1}), but an anomaly in \rho_{s}/\rho_{0}(T/T_{c}) (35 mT) might be relevant. It should be mentioned, however, that \muSR experiments found no obvious anomaly at T_{m} in this quantity, measured at various fields between 75 mT and 640 mT [16]. The upturn in H_{c1}(T) could also be due to a flux pinning effect, which can play a significant role in determining H_{c1}(T) on decreasing temperature. A similar situation occurs in isostructural PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, where enhancement of H_{c1}(T) below 0.6 K was found [44] but there is no anomaly at this temperature in specific heat or \muSR results [45].

We now analyze the temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_{c2} of Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. Results are shown in Figs. 5(b)-5(e). In a one-band superconductor, the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory [46] predicts an orbital limiting field H_{c2}^{\rm orb}(0)=0.73|dH_{c2}/dT|_{T}T_{c} in the clean limit, and H_{c2}^{\rm orb}(0)=0.69|dH_{c2}/dT|_{T}T_{c} in the dirty limit. A linear fit to H_{c2}(T) data near T_{c} (from T_{c} to 0.8 K below) gives initial slopes |dH_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}}=1.80(11) T K^{-1}, 1.74(17) T K^{-1}, 2.15(24) T K^{-1}, and 1.64(17) T K^{-1} for x=0,0.1,0.3 and 0.7, respectively. In either case of clean limit or dirty limit, H_{c2}^{\rm orb}(0) is smaller than the expected weak coupling Pauli limit field H_{c2}^{\rm P}(0)=1.84T_{c}=14.6 T, assuming a spin singlet state. However, both H_{c2}^{\rm orb}(0) and H_{c2}^{\rm P}(0) are much larger than H_{c2}(0). We thus speculate that the single-band Ginzburg-Landau theory does not describe SC well in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}; the SC OP is more complex.

The linear fit of H_{c2}(T) vs T/T_{c}, i.e., H_{c2}(T)/H_{c2}(0)=1-T/T_{c}, falls on most of the data. It gives \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)=2.07(2)T, 2.20 (0.04) T, 2.13 (2) T, and 2.04 (3) T for x=0,0.1,0.3 and 0.7, respectively. A quasilinear T dependence is often attributed to the dirty two-gap quasiclassical Usadel equations [47]. For example, a linear T-dependent H_{c2}(T) is observed in the multiband superconductor MgB_{2}, [48]. This suggests that SC in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} could be described by the Ginzburg-Landau theory in the dirty limit with nonmagnetic intraband and interband impurity scattering. Indeed, in polycrystalline PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, the mean-free path l_{\rm mfp} is estimated to be close to \xi(0) using the free electron theory, and l_{\rm mfp} is much smaller than the Pippard coherence length \xi_{p}\sim 360 nm [39].

 However, it should be noted that results on single-crystalline PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} gives the mean-free path l_{\rm mfp}=103 nm using \gamma_{e} from specific heat and \rho from resistivity measurements [19]. This is much larger than the coherence length \xi(0), and suggests that PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} is in the local and clean limit [19]. It is therefore evidence that the linearity of H_{c2}(T) is not of dirty-limit two-band origin. We conclude that more work is required to understand this situation. But still, the most important indication of H_{c2}(T) is that Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} are multiband superconductors. We further find that the empirical anisotropic two-band model [49] can well describe H_{c2}(T):

\[H_{c2}(T)/H_{c2}(0)=\frac{1-(T/T_{c})^{2}}{1+(T/T_{c})^{2}}.\] (6)

Fit parameters \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)=1.75(1) T, 1.87(3) T, 1.80(3) T, and 1.73(3) T are derived for x=0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.7, respectively.

### Muon spin relaxation

#### 1.2.1 Zero-field \muSr

Figure 6 shows representative \muSR asymmetry spectra measured in ZF for Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, x=0.3 and 0.7, above and below T_{c}. A nonrelaxing background signal originating from muons that miss the sample and stop in the silver sample holder has been subtracted from the data. As in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[17, 20], no early-time oscillations or fast relaxation is observed, indicating the absence of strong static magnetism (with or without long-range order). The small additional relaxation below T_{c} indicates the emergence of a distribution of weak spontaneous local fields [31].

Figure 7 gives the temperature dependence of the Gaussian relaxation rate \Delta in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, x=0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9, obtained from fits of Eqs. (1) and (2) to the data. In the normal state, \Delta is temperature independent, as expected for muon depolarization by dipolar fields from quasistatic nuclear moments [31]. The enhancement of \Delta(T) with decreasing temperature below T_{c} is due to the onset of static local fields, and is strong evidence for broken TRS [1, 50]. With increasing La content the enhancement decreases, and disappears at x=1 where TRS is fully restored [17]. Our results for x=0 agree with those of Ref. [17].

This increase is of electronic origin, so the electronic and random nuclear contributions (\Delta_{e} and \Delta_{n}, respectively) are uncorrelated and add in quadrature [11]:

\[\Delta(T)=\left[\Delta_{n}^{2}+\Delta_{e}^{2}(T)\right]^{1/2}.\] (7)

The curves in Fig. 7 are fits of Eq. (7) to the data using the approximate empirical expression [51],

\[\Delta_{e}(T)=\Delta_{e}(0)\tanh\left(b\sqrt{\frac{T_{m}}{T}-1}\right)\quad(T \,<T_{m}),\] (8)

assuming that \Delta_{e} has the temperature dependence of a BCS-like OP but the transition temperature is T_{m} rather than T_{c}. In Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, the coefficient b (Table 1) is somewhat smaller than the isotropic BCS value of 1.74 in the weak coupling limit.

The dip followed by an increase in \Delta(T) below T_{c} (Fig. 7) was also noted in Ref. [17], and its reproducibility suggests that it is not an instrumental effect. Screening of magnetic impurity dipolar fields was proposed as its origin [17]. Later work [20] indicated that this mechanism is too weak to produce the effect, however, and its origin is not understood.

Figure 8(a) gives the T-x phase diagram for the Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} alloy system. Intriguingly, T_{m}<T_{c} for x\lesssim 0.5, as previously reported in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[17] where it is particularly obvious. The zero-temperature width \Delta_{e}(0)/\gamma_{\mu} of the broken-TRS field distribution [52] is shown in Fig. 8(b). It is interesting to note that \Delta_{e}(0)/\gamma_{\mu} and the pointlike node gap fraction from specific heat results [Fig. 8(b)] have the same x dependence, which is highly nonlinear compared to that in the Pr(Os_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{4}Sb_{12}, Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Os_{4}Sb_{12}, or Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} alloy systems [20, 33]. We thus speculate that the origin of the

Curves: Fits of Eqs. (7) and (8) assuming a BCS-like temperature dependence. Arrows: T_{c} from specific heat, T_{m} from onset of broken TRS.

  broken TRS in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is strongly correlated with the anisotropic gap structure. Noting that T_{m}<T_{c} for x\lesssim 0.5, we also speculate that interaction between neighboring Pr^{3+} ions contributes to the difference between T_{m} and T_{c}.

Figure 9 shows the ZF exponential damping rate \lambda(T) in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, x=0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9. In PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and Pr-rich alloys, there is a distinct maximum in \lambda(T) below T_{c}, followed by a decrease to a nonzero value as T\to 0. In the normal state above T_{c}, \lambda(T) increases with increasing temperature. The temperature-dependent features become smaller with increasing x, and for x=0.7 the rate is essentially temperature independent. For x=0.8, \lambda(T) increases with decreasing temperature below \sim5 K \approx 0.6T_{c}, and for x=0.9 there are not enough normal-state data to determine a temperature dependence. The La concentration dependence of the zero-field \lambda(T) in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (Fig. 9) is similar to that observed in Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, which is discussed in some detail by Zhang _et al._[20].

The maximum in \lambda(T) is accompanied by a dip in \Delta(T) at \simT_{c} (Fig. 7). The fit quality, denoted by \chi^{2}, is good for all the fits. This might be an effect of statistical correlation between the two parameters, but the dip in \Delta is still present when \lambda(T) is fixed in (poorer-quality) fits of Eqs. (1) and (2) to P_{\mu}(t).

Mechanisms for \lambda(T) are discussed further in Sec. III.3.3.

#### iii.3.2 Longitudinal-field \muSR

In ZF, the dynamic and static field contributions to the muon spin relaxation rate are hard to disentangle experimentally. The usual procedure for doping this is measurement of A_{\mu}(t) in a longitudinal field {\bf H}_{L} parallel to the initial muon spin polarization {\bf P}_{\mu}(0). For H_{L} much greater than static local fields at muon sites (\omega_{L}\gg\Delta), the resultant static field is nearly parallel to {\bf P}_{\mu}(0), so there is little static muon relaxation (precession and dephasing). Then {\bf P}_{\mu}(t) is said to be "decoupled" from the static local fields, and any remaining relaxation for high H_{L} is dynamic in origin, due to thermal fluctuation of the local fields.

A field dependence of the dynamic relaxation rate is also expected, due to the proportionality of \lambda to the fluctuation noise power at \omega_{L}; in general, this is reduced at high frequencies. If the fluctuations are characterized by a correlation time \tau_{c},\ \lambda(H_{L}) is given by the Redfield equation [53],

\[\lambda_{\rm LF}(H_{L})=\frac{\delta\omega_{\rm rms}^{2}\tau_{c}}{1+(\omega_{L }\tau_{c})^{2}},\] (9)

in the motionally narrowed limit \delta\omega_{\rm rms}\tau_{c}\ll 1, where \delta\omega_{\rm rms}=\gamma_{\mu}\langle\delta B_{\rm loc}^{2}(t)\rangle^{1/2} is the rms fluctuating local field amplitude in frequency units. Thus \lambda_{\rm LF}(H_{L}) decreases with increasing H_{L} for \omega_{L}\tau_{c}\gtrsim 1. This field dependence can be distinguished from decoupling if 1/\tau_{c} is sufficiently larger than the static rate \Delta.

LF\muSR experiments were carried out in the normal state (T=10 K) of Pr_{0.3}La_{0.7}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. Muon spin-polarization time spectra P_{\mu}(t), obtained from the asymmetry A_{\mu}(t) by subtracting the signal from the cold finger and normalizing, are shown in Fig. 10. The field dependence of P_{\mu}(t) shows characteristics of both decoupling and field-dependent dynamic relaxation: the small-amplitude oscillation with frequency \omega_{L} at intermediate fields is a feature of decoupling [31], but decoupling alone would not account for the nonzero field dependence of the overall relaxation rate at intermediate fields.

These data have been fit using Eqs. (1) and (3). The field dependence of \lambda_{\rm LF} for Pr_{0.3}La_{0.7}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} at 10 K is shown in Fig. 11. For \mu_{0}H_{L}\geqslant 0.5 mT, a good fit to Eq. (9) is obtained, which yields \tau_{c}=1.0(1)\,\mus and \delta B_{\rm rms}=0.29(1) mT. The motional-narrowing criterion \delta\omega_{\rm rms}\tau_{c}\ll 1 is more or less satisfied [\delta\omega_{\rm rms}\tau_{c}=0.25(3)], but the local field fluctuations

  are close to "adiabatic." The same behavior is observed in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}[11], with similar parameter values.

Values of the static rate \Delta and the ZF damping rate \lambda_{\rm ZF} are also shown in Fig. 11. The relation \Delta\tau_{c}\ll 1, necessary to separate decoupling and dynamic-rate field dependencies, is also more or less satisfied [\Delta\tau_{c}=0.14(1)]. The fit value \lambda_{\rm LF}(H_{L}\!\to\!0)=0.062(2)\,\mus^{-1} is less than \lambda_{\rm ZF}, suggesting a static contribution to the latter. This would indicate a so-called Voigtian static field distribution, i.e., the convolution of Gaussian and Lorentzian distributions [54]. An early report of a Voigtian distribution in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[17] was not reproduced in later studies [20].

#### iii.2.3 Mechanism for dynamic muon relaxation?

There are two candidate sources of fluctuating \mu^{+} local fields in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}; Pr^{3+}4f fluctuations and nuclear magnetism. There is no Pr^{3+} local moment, since the Pr^{3+} non-Kramers crystal-field ground state is nonmagnetic. Although 4f/conduction-band mixing is likely in these alloys, the \mu^{+} contact interaction with conduction or 4f electrons is normally weak and relaxation rates are too slow to be observed in the \muSR time window. This can be seen from an estimation of the conduction-electron hyperfine coupling constant \omega_{\rm hf} (or hyperfine field H_{\rm hf}=\omega_{\rm hf}/\gamma_{\mu}) needed to yield the observed \mu^{+} relaxation rate, since \lambda\approx\omega_{\rm hf}^{2}\tau_{c}, and for conduction-electron relaxation \tau_{c} is at the most of the order of \hbar/k_{B}T_{\rm F}\sim 10^{-13}\,s, where T_{\rm F}\sim 100\,K is the "Fermi temperature" from the specific heat of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[29] and associated with a putative 4f band. With the observed \lambda\sim 0.1\,\mus^{-1}, this yields \mu_{0}H_{\rm hf}\sim 1\,T, which is is an order of magnitude larger than typical muon/conduction-electron or muon/4f hyperfine fields in metals [55].

In Pr-rich alloys, ^{141}Pr nuclei are dominant. In PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, as in Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}[20], the \mu^{+}\,\lambda(T) resembles the ^{73}Ge NMR relaxation rate [18], and is similarly reminiscent of Hebel-Slichter relaxation [23] in fully gapped superconductors. This suggests ^{141}Pr spin fluctuations with correlation times \tau_{c} slower than the motionally narrowed limit, in which case \lambda\sim 1/\tau_{c}.

The Hebel-Slichter rate vanishes exponentially as T\to 0, whereas in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and its alloys the muon spin relaxation remains nonzero at low temperatures. We note, however, that mechanisms for fluctuating nuclear magnetism are of two kinds: spin-lattice (T_{1}) relaxation, due to interactions with the electronic environment, and spin-spin (T_{2}) relaxation, due to interactions between nuclei [56]. The latter are not expected to be temperature dependent at ordinary temperatures. Contributions of both mechanisms to nuclear spin fluctuations would be consistent with the observed behavior.

There is a problem with this scenario in Pr-rich alloys, however: The ^{141}Pr dipolar fields should be fluctuating fully (i.e., have no static component), in which case the "dynamic" K-T relaxation function [31] is appropriate. But as in Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}[20], fits to this function are not as good as fits using Eqs. (1) and (2). This is perhaps less of a difficulty for La-rich alloys, where ^{139}La nuclear spin fluctuations are expected to be much slower and could account for the static relaxation. The reduction with increasing x of the temperature dependence of \lambda (which is nearly T independent in Pr_{0.3}La_{0.7}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}) is consistent with this possibility, but the increased \lambda(T) below T_{c} for x=0.8 is not understood. The situation remains unclear, and more work needs to be done.

## IV Discussion

### Multiband superconductivity

We have shown that in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, upper critical fields H_{c2}(T) are consistent with two SC gaps. The two-band \alpha model is capable of describing the specific-heat results. We found that the larger-gap band has point nodes and the smaller-gap band is weakly coupled. The small fraction f of the BCS gap for x=0.3 and 0.7 suggests that SC of Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is dominated by the larger band with point nodes. Values of \Delta C_{p}/\gamma_{e}T_{c} for Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} are all slightly larger than the BCS value of 1.43, indicating that PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} is an unconventional superconductor. Pr-based filled skutterudites, including PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}[57, 58, 59], PrRu_{4}As_{12}

  [60], and PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}[59, 61], might all be multiband superconductors.

Transverse field \muSR results [16] concluded that in polycrystalline PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} the gap functions |\Delta_{0}sin\theta| and \Delta_{0}(1-sin^{4}\thetacos^{4}\theta), both with point nodes, can best describe the gap symmetry. These are also candidate gap functions for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}[62, 63]. However, a study of single-crystalline PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[19] reports two isotropic BCS gaps. While our H_{c2}(T) and C_{e}(T) results suggest multiband SC, point gap nodes in one band are favored by C_{e}(T) results, corresponding well to the \muSR study [16]. Still, we cannot rule out the possibility of multiple isotropic bands in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, since the fit quality is only delicately worse.

The discrepancy in C_{e}(T) between polycrystalline and single-crystalline PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} was previously attributed to the inaccurate subtraction of the nuclear Schottky anomaly at low temperature [19]. Although accurate subtraction is difficult, this only affects the analysis of C_{e}(T) at low temperatures, and fits over the entire temperature range <T_{c} yield evidence for point gap nodes. Furthermore, the Schottky anomaly is reduced and not observed in x> 0.5 alloys, whereas C_{e}(T)\proptoT^{3.1} is still found in Pr_{0.3}La_{0.7}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. High-quality single crystalline Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} samples will be required to clarify the origin of this discrepancy.

It should be mentioned that we did not observe any obvious specific heat jump around T_{m} in both x = 0 and x = 0.3 with a C_{e}(T) measurement T step \Delta T = 0.025 K. Moreover, C_{e}(T) anomaly at T_{m} was not reported in several previous works, including the single crystal study by Zhang _et al_. [19]. While our ZF-\muSR results provide strong indication of T_{m}<T_{c} in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}(see also discussion Sec. IV.2), the absence of multiple C_{e}(T) jumps put constraints on taking T_{m} as a second SC transition temperature. If there are multiple components in the SC OP of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, it is possible that one of the components that breaks TRS is not sufficient to generate an obvious C_{e} discontinuity at T_{m}. Further study on the nature of TRSB below T_{m} is desired.

### Broken time-reversal symmetry

In general, the violation of TRS naturally occurs in bulk superconductors with nonunitary states [1, 64]. Broken TRS can emerge at temperatures differing from T_{c}, such as in the E_{2n} odd-parity triplet state candidate UPt_{3}[9]. The appealing claim of spin-triplet chiral p wave states in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} was first anticipated from superfluid density results [16]. To date, other experimental confirmations of other implications are still lacking.

A singlet pairing state cannot be ruled out, due to the continuous variation of \delta B_{s}(x) as well as the smooth and small change of T_{c}(x) in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. These results suggest a continuous variation of OP symmetry between LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[17, 21], where LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is characterized by a spin-singlet state.

Broken TRS tends to be stabilized by the forming of a subdominant gap [64]. Thus, if a spin-singlet state is present in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, a straightforward explanation of broken TRS, point gap nodes together with a BCS gap, and T_{m}<T_{c} might be chirality in a superconducting state with an s-wave component [22], e.g., the d+is state [64]. Then supercurrents form around non-magnetic imperfections, resulting in local fields and the enhancement of \Delta(T) below T_{m}[17, 65]. A subdominant s-wave component in the SC OP of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} results in the two-consecutive SC phase feature [64, 66].

It was observed [40] that in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} the critical current density I_{c} decreases exponentially with increasing applied field and decreases linearly with increasing temperature. The absence of an anomaly in I_{c}(H) around T_{m} indicates no macroscopic separation of multiple SC phases [39], but is not evidence against the claim of multiple components in the SC OP.

The model of Koga, Matsumoto, and Shiba (KMS) [67], which proposed several T_{h} symmetric irreducible representations for isostructural PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, suggests that in this compound SC with broken TRS is driven by crystal-field excitonic Cooper-pairing [33]. With increasing La concentration, the weakened Pr-Pr intersite interaction results in a crossover between SC ground states with broken and preserved TRS due to less excitonic dispersion, resulting in a monotonic decrease in \delta B_{s}(x) in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Os_{4}Sb_{12}[33].

To some extent, Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} resembles Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Os_{4}Sb_{12}, since both end compounds are superconductors and they both exhibit a continuous decrease in \delta B_{s} on increasing x. Considering the small variation of T_{c} and the smooth evolution of \delta B_{s}(x) in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, the KMS model might be applicable to describe the SC OP in this alloy series. Sergienko and Curne [68] also proposed a singlet-state model for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, based on the assumptions of point gap nodes as well as equivalent OP between the TRS breaking SC phase and the TRS-preserved one. These assumptions are compatible with our results in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}. In this case, the absence of multiple SC specific heat jumps in tetrahedral Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is a reflection of orbital components in the OP, and the broken TRS originates from a complex orbitally degenerate OP in the spin-singlet state within the strong SOC limit [17, 68].

It should be mentioned that orbital degrees of freedom further complicate the origin of the SC excitation gap. It was found that even-parity superconductors with broken TRS have multiband OP [1, 69]. These superconductors are characteristic of two-dimensional Fermi surfaces, with nodes in the gap replaced by Bogoliubov quasiparticles. PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} could be such a candidate material, considering the broken TRS state with multiband feature. Moreover, it was recently proposed that three-dimensional chiral superconductors with strong SOC and odd-parity states can be the host of gapless Majorana fermions [22]. PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} was proposed as a candidate for such a system, due to the existence of point gap nodes, broken TRS, and a possible spin-triplet state. Isostructural PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} was also proposed to be a candidate material. The two-band feature is not evidence against a nonunitary state [22]. We thus note here that the origin of the multiband feature with nodal gap structure and broken TRS in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} remains an unsolved problem.

## V Concluding remarks

We report specific heat, critical field, ZF-, and LF-\muSR studies of well-characterized polycrystalline superconducting Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, to investigate the SC OP of the parent  compound PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}. There is no obvious SC pair breaking effect in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, since T_{c}(x) varies only slightly. We find that Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} alloys exhibit broken TRS, with a signature local field distribution width \delta B_{s} below T_{c} that continuously decreases with increasing x, disappearing for x\sim 1. This behavior is a reflection of a crossover between broken and preserved TRS SC across the alloy series, similar to Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. The most intriguing feature is that the onset temperatures T_{m} for broken TRS in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (x\lesssim 0.5) are below T_{c}, as is most obvious in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}. Furthermore, H_{c1}(T) exhibits a second quadratic temperature region below T_{q}\approx T_{m}\sim 6 K. These results are likely due to the intrinsic two-consecutive-SC-phase nature of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}. Critical fields H_{c2}(T) and the specific heat C_{e}(T) in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} can be well described by a two-band model, with C_{e}(T) suggesting a dominant point-node gap structure in the pairing symmetry. However, there are no obvious multiple SC specific-heat jumps at T_{m}. Based on these results, we conclude that PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} is likely to be a multiband superconductor characterized by a complex multicomponent SC OP with orbitally degenerate representations. Our results motivate further studies of SC excitation gap symmetry in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and isostructural compounds, including PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}. Transverse-field \muSR experiments in the vortex-lattice state, which yield the superfluid density, will help to determine the gap symmetry and are planned for the future. We conclude that Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is a unique candidate for further study of unconventional SC with intrinsic multiple phases.

###### Abstract

The superconducting state of the filled skutterudite alloy series Pr1-_x_La,Pt_{4}Ge_{12} has been systematically studied by specific heat and zero-field muon spin relaxation (\muSR), while the critical fields have been determined by magnetization measurements. An additional inhomogeneous local magnetic field, indicative of broken time-reversal symmetry, is observed in the superconducting states of the alloys. For x\lesssim 0.5, the broken-TRS phase sets in below a temperature T_{m}, distinctly lower than the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}. For x\gtrsim 0.5, T_{m}\approx T_{c}. The local field strength decreases as x\to 1, where LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is characterized by conventional pairing. The lower critical field H_{c1}(T) of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} shows the onset of a second quadratic temperature region below T_{q}\sim T_{m}. Upper critical field H_{c2}(T) measurements suggest multiband superconductivity, and point gap nodes are consistent with the specific heat data. In Pr1-_x_La,Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, only a single specific-heat discontinuity is observed at T_{c}, in contrast to the second jump seen in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} below T_{c}. These results suggest that superconductivity in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} is characterized by a complex order parameter.

## I Introduction

The study of novel superconductors with intrinsic multiple superconducting phases has broadened the understanding of the microscopic origin of unconventional superconductivity (SC) [1,2]. A particular challenge is to clearly identify multiple SC phases in unconventional superconductors and to interpret their SC order parameter(s) (OP).

Gauge symmetry is always broken in the superconducting state. A key indication of multiphase SC is the observation of additional broken symmetry [time-reversal symmetry (TRS), inversion symmetry] at a distinct temperature T_{m} below the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}. However, superconductors with intrinsic multiple SC phases are extremely rare. T_{c}\sim T_{m} for many superconductors with broken TRS, such as Sr_{2}RuO_{4}[3], LaNiC_{2}[4], SrPtAs [5], and Re{\rm\acute{e}}Zr [6]. Empirically, superconductors with 4f or 5f electron elements are likely to have complex SC OPs [1,7] that can possibly lead to the emergence of multiple SC phases. For example, superconducting U_{1-x}Th_{x}Be_{13}[8] and UPt_{3}[9] were found to exhibit broken TRS at T_{m}<T_{c}, which suggests the existence of a second SC phase below T_{m}. The unusual properties of these heavy fermion (HF) superconductors have led to theories that invoke odd-parity (spin-triplet) Cooper pairing [2].

Of particular interest in the small family of multiphase superconductors is the puzzling SC OP of the filled-skutterudite f-electron compound PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}[10], which exhibits broken TRS [11]. Several thermodynamic experiments show evidence for two SC transitions [12,13] in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, although T_{m} is not clearly below the upper T_{c}=1.85 K in muon spin relaxation (\muSR) experiments [11] and it has been argued [14] that the double T_{c} nature is not intrinsic. The SC OP of PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} is a consequence of crystalline-electric-field and strong spin-orbital coupling (SOC) effects [10], and is complicated by the low T_{c} and HF behavior.

The isostructural compound PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, with a smaller electron effective mass m^{*}, is considered to share great similarity with PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} in the pairing state [15,16], although no multiple SC phases have been reported. The much higher T_{c}\sim 7.8 K and non-HF state makes PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} a simpler playground to study SC in Pr-based filled skutterudites. Then the key question is whether the OP in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} is complex, including the possibility of a spin-triplet state and broken TRS [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].

The pairing symmetry of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} remains controversial. The observed broken TRS suggests an OP with either spin or orbital moments [17]. Thermodynamic studies reported the presence of pointlike nodes in the SC energy gap [15]. Superfluid density measurements by transverse-field \muSR [16] suggest a nonunitary chiral p-wave state with gap function \Delta_{0}|k_{x}\pm ik_{y}|, where \Delta_{0} is the magnitude of the gap. These experimental observations motivated theoretical predictions of spin-nondegenerate nodal quasiparticle excitations due to strong SOC [22]. On the other hand, the T_{c}s of the La-doped series compounds are quite close and they vary continuously, with both end compounds being two-band superconductor candidates [21]. This indicates that the OPs of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} could be compatible. The observation of a Hebel-Slichter coherence peak [23] below T_{c} in the ^{73}Ge NMR relaxation rate in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[18] is evidence of weakly coupled conventional pairing. The situation is clearly quite fluid.

In this paper, we argue that unconventional SC with a complex OP in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} is favored by our doping study of Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9, using measurements of specific heats, superconducting critical fields determined by magnetization measurements, and muon spin relaxation (\muSR) in zero and longitudinal [24] fields (ZF- and LF-\muSR, respectively) [25, 26, 27]. Broken TRS in superconductors often results in an inhomogeneous local magnetic field **B**loc below T_{c}, which can be readily detected by ZF-\muSR experiments. The width \delta B_{s} of this field distribution is roughly \Delta_{e}/\gamma_{\mu}, where \Delta_{e} is the contribution of the field distribution to the static Gaussian muon spin relaxation rate \Delta and \gamma_{\mu}/2\pi = 135.53 MHz/T is the muon gyromagnetic ratio [3, 11]. We find broken TRS in all samples, with a continuous decrease of \delta B_{s} with increasing La doping. LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is a conventional superconductor [21, 28]. Intriguingly, T_{m} is clearly lower than T_{c} for x\lesssim 0.5, and T_{c}-T_{m} is significant in Pr-rich alloys (\sim1 K in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}). The temperature dependence of the lower critical field H_{c1}(T) shows an anomaly at a temperature T_{q}\sim T_{m} in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}: H_{c1}\propto T^{2} both above and below T_{q}, but with an increased coefficient below this temperature. The upper critical field H_{c2}(T) of Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.7, is well described by a two-band SC model. We find evidence for point gap nodes in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} from specific heat data, but no second SC jump in the specific heat at \simT_{m} in any of the measured alloys. Our results indicate a multicomponent SC OP in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, which results in intrinsic multiple SC phases.

## II Sample characterization and experimental methods

### Sample preparation

Synthesis procedures for our polycrystalline Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} samples (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9) were similar to those described in Refs. [15, 29]. The body-centered-cubic structure (point group T_{h}, space group Im\bar{3}) was confirmed by Rietveld refinements of powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. The observed isostructural linear expansion of lattice constant a with La concentration x (Fig. 1) is consistent with Vegard's law. No obvious Pr/La occupation defect is found.

### Specific heat

Measurements of the specific heat C_{p} of the samples were performed using a standard thermal relaxation technique in a commercial PPMS EverCool-II device (Quantum Design). Measurements on the x = 0.3 and 0.7 samples were also carried out in a dilution refrigerator. The sample surfaces were polished flat to make good thermal contact. The Debye-Sommerfeld approximation C_{p}=C_{e}+C_{\rm ph}=\gamma_{e}T+\beta_{\rm ph}T^{3} was fit to the normal-state specific heat, measured in a magnetic field of 3 T over the temperature range 2-10 K. The Debye temperature was obtained from the relation \theta_{D}=(12\pi^{4}N_{\rm a}nk_{B}/5\beta_{\rm ph})^{1/3}, where N_{\rm a} is Avogadro's number, n is the number of atoms per formula unit, and k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant.

For Pr_{0.7}La_{0.3}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, an upturn in the temperature dependence of C_{p} below \sim0.5 K was observed, due to a Schottky contribution [30]C_{\rm Sch}\propto T^{-2} from quadrupole-split ^{14}Pr nuclei (data not shown). The fit gives C_{\rm Sch}(T)/\gamma_{e}=0.0015(3)\ T^{-2} K, which was subtracted to obtain C_{e} of Pr_{0.7}La_{0.3}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. A Schottky anomaly was also reported in the parent compound PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[16], but is not observed in Pr_{0.3}La_{0.7}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} down to 0.1 K. It is possible that there is Schottky contribution in the low-temperature C_{p}, but it is small due to diluted ^{141}Pr nuclei and thus hard to fit and be subtracted from C_{p}.

### Magnetic susceptibility

Susceptibility measurements were carried out using a commercial vibrating sample magnetometer (Quantum Design) down to 2 K. Upper critical fields H_{c2} were taken as the onset of the superconducting magnetization M_{s}(H,T) in field-cooled experiments. Lower critical fields H_{c1} were determined from the field dependence of M_{s}(H,T) measured after cooling in "zero" field (less than \sim0.3 mT). H_{c1} was defined typically as the field value where the magnetization deviates from the field shielding initial slope. Figure 2 shows the determination of H_{c1} at several representative temperatures. Results are discussed in Sec. III.2.

### \muSr

In time-differential \muSR [25, 26, 27], spin-polarized muons are implanted into the sample and decay via the weak interaction: \mu^{\pm}\to e^{\pm}+\bar{\nu}_{\mu}(\nu_{\mu})+\nu_{e}(\bar{\nu}_{e}). The decay positron (electron) count rate asymmetry A_{\mu}(t) in a given direction is proportional to the muon ensemble spin polarization P_{\mu}(t) in that direction, and yields information on static and dynamic local fields at the muon sites. Positive muons (\mu^{+}), which stop at interstitial sites in solids, are generally used because they sample local magnetism better than negative muons, which are tightly bound to nuclei.

\muSR experiments were carried out on samples with x = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 using the MUSR spectrometer at the ISIS Neutron and Muon Facility, Rutherford Appleton

The observed ZF and LF asymmetry time spectra A_{\mu}(t)=a_{0}P_{\mu}(t), where a_{0} is the initial asymmetry, are well described by the exponentially damped Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe polarization function [31] plus a background signal from the silver sample holder with a weighing factor f_{\mu}1.

Footnote 1: Data from Ref. [15].

\[P_{\mu}(t)=f_{\mu}e^{-\lambda t}G_{F}^{\rm{KT}}(\Delta,t)+(1-f_{\mu})P_{\rm{Ag}},\] (1)

where F= ZF or LF, \Delta/\gamma_{\mu} is the rms width of a Gaussian distribution of static local fields, and the damping rate \lambda is often interpreted as a dynamic relaxation rate due to thermal fluctuations of the muon local field [32]. Here

\[G_{\rm{ZF}}^{\rm{KT}}(\Delta,t)=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{3}(1-\Delta^{2}t^{2})\exp \big{(}-\frac{1}{2}\Delta^{2}t^{2}\big{)}\] (2)

and

\[G_{\rm{LF}}^{\rm{KT}}(\Delta_{\rm{LF}},t) = 1-\frac{2\Delta_{\rm{LF}}^{2}}{\omega_{L}^{2}}\big{[}1-\exp\big{(} -\frac{1}{2}\Delta_{\rm{LF}}^{2}t^{2}\big{)}\cos(\omega_{L}t)\big{]}\] \[+\frac{2\Delta_{\rm{LF}}^{4}}{\omega_{L}^{3}}\int_{0}^{t}\exp \big{(}-\frac{1}{2}\Delta_{\rm{LF}}^{2}t^{2}\big{)}\sin(\omega_{L}\tau)\,d\tau,\]

where \omega_{L}=\gamma_{\mu}H_{L} is the muon Zeeman frequency in the longitudinal field H_{L}. Equations (1)-(3) have previously been used to analyze data from PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} and PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and their alloys [11, 17, 20, 33].

The last term P_{\rm{Ag}}=e^{-\lambda_{\rm{Ag}}t} in Eq. (1) is due to muons that miss the sample and stop in the silver sample holder. Measured silver relaxation rates \lambda_{\rm{Ag}} are sample dependent but very small (\sim0.1-10 ms^{-1}), with weak temperature and initial muon energy dependencies [34, 35]. This background signal is often considered as nonrelaxing (P_{\rm{Ag}}\sim 1) when sample relaxation is much larger. We here apply P_{\rm{Ag}}=1. Its fraction (1-f_{\mu}) is well determined using low-temperature \muSR asymmetry spectra, where the silver signal dominates the late-time data. Using a nonzero silver relaxation rate (10 ms^{-1}) does not change the fit results appreciably.

## III Results

The lattice constant a, superconducting transition temperatures T_{c}^{C_{\rho}} from the specific heat, Sommerfeld coefficients \gamma_{e}, Debye temperatures \theta_{D}, and the relative specific heat discontinuity \Delta C_{\rho}/\gamma_{e}T_{c} at T_{c} are summarized in Table 1, including data for the two end compounds (x=0 and 1) from Refs. [15, 16]. The quantity b is the coefficient in Eq. (8) of Sec. III.3.1, where \muSR relaxation data are analyzed assuming the contribution \Delta_{e}(T) to the static relaxation rate due to broken TRS exhibits a BCS gaplike temperature dependence.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c} x & a (Å) & T_{c} (K) & \gamma_{e} (mJ/mol K^{2}) & \Delta C_{\rho}/\gamma_{e}T_{c} & \theta_{D} (K) & b \\ \hline
0.01  & 8.6111(6) & 7.91 & 87.1 & 1.56 & 198 & 1.2(1) \\
0.1 & 8.6134(1) & 7.85 (5) & 76.3 (6) & 1.56 (3) & 201.3 (2) & – \\
0.3 & 8.6150(2) & 7.87 (5) & 67.9 (5) & 1.67 (4) & 203.7 (1) & 1.2(2) \\
0.5 & 8.6198(5  and 0.9, are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. There is only one obvious SC specific heat jump for all La concentrations, so that macroscopic separation of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} SC phases due to sample inhomogeneity is unlikely. The nonlinearity of the T_{c}/T dependence of \ln(C_{e}/\gamma_{e}T_{c}) for all measured samples [Fig. 3(a)] suggests structure in the superconducting gap [1, 29]. A simple power-law fit to C_{e} vs T (C_{e}\propto T^{n}) can give heuristic estimation of the gap symmetry, The values of the power n are displayed in Fig. 3(b). A \simT^{3}-dependent C_{e} suggests point gap nodes in x\neq 1 alloys. Also, the values of \Delta C_{p}/\gamma_{e}T_{c} for all measured samples are slightly larger than the BCS value of 1.43 [Fig. 3(c)], indicating unconventional SC.

The temperature dependencies of the specific heats for x=0.3 and 0.7 alloys down to T/T_{c}\approx 0.02 are displayed in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). For T<T_{c}, C_{e}(T) can be best described by the two-component "\alpha model" [37] with a weighting factor f:

\[C_{e}=fC_{e1}+(1-f)C_{e2}\,.\] (4)

This phenomenological model has been used to describe multiband superconductors such as MgB_{2}[38], and Eq. (4) with both C_{e1} and C_{e2} based on the BCS theory with different gaps was used to characterize LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}[21]. In Pr_{0.7}La_{0.3}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} and Pr_{0.3}La_{0.2}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, however, C_{e}(T) can be best fit using C_{e1}\propto e^{-\Delta_{1}/k_{B}T} and C_{e2}\propto T^{n}, which are empirical expressions for a full gap and a gap with nodes, respectively [1]. This parametrization results in f=0.17, n=2.91, and \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.33 for Pr_{0.7}La_{0.3}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}; and f=0.26, n=3.1, and \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.13 for Pr_{0.3}La_{0.7}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. The increase in f with increasing x suggests the gradual disappearance of the point-node gap as x increases, and for x=1, where TRS is fully restored, there is no power-law term (f=1) [28]. Other forms for C_{e1} and C_{e2} result in worse fit quality. Since specific heat of LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} can be well fit by a two isotropic band model [21], fit of C_{e}(T) using two isotropic BCS gap functions could be used for comparison. For x=0.3, \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.05 and \Delta_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}=3.51, with f=0.31. For x=0.7, \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}=4.19 and \Delta_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.21, with f=0.77.

At low temperatures, a single fully gapped scenario does not yield the measured C_{e}(T) of either Pr_{0.7}La_{0.3}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} or Pr_{0.3}La_{0.7}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}; neither the asymptotic form [36]

\[\lim_{T\to 0}\frac{C_{e}}{\gamma_{e}T}=3.15\bigg{(}\frac{\Delta_{0}}{1.76k_{B}T }\bigg{)}^{5/2}\exp\bigg{(}-\frac{\Delta_{0}}{k_{B}T}\bigg{)}\] (5)

nor a simple exponential fit the data. The best fits to the data at low temperatures (0.1\,\mathrm{K}<T<0.3T_{c}) are to Eq. (4) with the low-temperature asymptotic form for C_{e1}(T) and a power law for C_{e2}(T) with n=3. Fits to weighted sums of T^{2} and T^{3} result in f\to 0 for T^{2}, precluding the possibility of line nodes in the gap. The goodness of fit for single power-law T^{3} fits is worse than for multicomponent fits.

We have summarized the fit results in Table 2. Our results suggest that Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} alloys are multiband superconductors, with one of the gap functions favoring pointlike nodes. But we cannot rule out the possibility of multiple isotropic gaps in x=0.3 and 0.7 alloys due to the close fit quality.

Our specific heat measurements in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} are in good agreement with previous work [15, 21, 16], except that reported values of the Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma_{e} for x=0 and 1 (Table 1) are somewhat higher than extrapolations from the alloys. Differences between reported values have been noted previously, and may be due to measurements at different fields and temperatures [29]. There is no evidence for sample differences based on comparison with published results [15, 29]; in particular, we do not observe the dramatic decrease in \gamma_{e} found in Pr_{0.5}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}[39] and attributed to Pr vacancies.

For all x, the values of \Delta C_{p}/\gamma_{e}T_{c} are slightly larger than the BCS value of 1.43.

  

### Critical fields

The origin of the difference between T_{m} and T_{c} has been further investigated by lower and upper critical field measurements. Results are shown in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5(a), we observe the possible existence of a second quadratic temperature dependence region below T_{q}\sim 6 K in H_{c1}(T) of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}. Within errors, T_{q} is close to the onset of broken TRS T_{m} (results shown later in Sec. III.3), but is slightly higher in a similar H_{c1}(T) study [40]. In contrast, H_{c2}(T) does not exhibit enhancement below T_{m}, but rather a smooth increase with decreasing temperature for all the measured Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} as shown in Figs. 5(b)-5(e).

The origins of H_{c1}(T) and H_{c2}(T) are different. H_{c1}(T) might provide a heuristic description of the gap symmetry, since in the London limit (coherence length \xi much smaller than the penetration depth \Lambda) [41]H_{c1}(T)/H_{c1}(0) is proportional to the superfluid density \rho_{s}\propto n_{s}/m^{*}[42]. For a fully gapped conventional superconductor such as pure niobium, H_{c1}(T)/H_{c1}(0)=1-(T/T_{c})^{2}[43]. The occurrence of the second quadratic temperature region thus indicates gap structure, possibly multiband structure or gap anisotropy.

Considering the onset of broken TRS at T_{m}, the extra enhancement of H_{c1}(T) below T_{q} could imply the occurrence of a distinct magnetic phase below T_{c} as in U_{1-x}Th_{x}Be_{13}[8]. Intriguingly, Ref. [16] showed that \rho_{s}/\rho_{0}(T/T_{c}) measured at 35 mT slightly deviates from other field results at T/T_{c}\sim 0.75 (close to T_{q}). This deviation was attributed to larger vortex disorder at fields close to H_{c1}), but an anomaly in \rho_{s}/\rho_{0}(T/T_{c}) (35 mT) might be relevant. It should be mentioned, however, that \muSR experiments found no obvious anomaly at T_{m} in this quantity, measured at various fields between 75 mT and 640 mT [16]. The upturn in H_{c1}(T) could also be due to a flux pinning effect, which can play a significant role in determining H_{c1}(T) on decreasing temperature. A similar situation occurs in isostructural PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, where enhancement of H_{c1}(T) below 0.6 K was found [44] but there is no anomaly at this temperature in specific heat or \muSR results [45].

We now analyze the temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_{c2} of Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. Results are shown in Figs. 5(b)-5(e). In a one-band superconductor, the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory [46] predicts an orbital limiting field H_{c2}^{\rm orb}(0)=0.73|dH_{c2}/dT|_{T}T_{c} in the clean limit, and H_{c2}^{\rm orb}(0)=0.69|dH_{c2}/dT|_{T}T_{c} in the dirty limit. A linear fit to H_{c2}(T) data near T_{c} (from T_{c} to 0.8 K below) gives initial slopes |dH_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}}=1.80(11) T K^{-1}, 1.74(17) T K^{-1}, 2.15(24) T K^{-1}, and 1.64(17) T K^{-1} for x=0,0.1,0.3 and 0.7, respectively. In either case of clean limit or dirty limit, H_{c2}^{\rm orb}(0) is smaller than the expected weak coupling Pauli limit field H_{c2}^{\rm P}(0)=1.84T_{c}=14.6 T, assuming a spin singlet state. However, both H_{c2}^{\rm orb}(0) and H_{c2}^{\rm P}(0) are much larger than H_{c2}(0). We thus speculate that the single-band Ginzburg-Landau theory does not describe SC well in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}; the SC OP is more complex.

The linear fit of H_{c2}(T) vs T/T_{c}, i.e., H_{c2}(T)/H_{c2}(0)=1-T/T_{c}, falls on most of the data. It gives \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)=2.07(2)T, 2.20 (0.04) T, 2.13 (2) T, and 2.04 (3) T for x=0,0.1,0.3 and 0.7, respectively. A quasilinear T dependence is often attributed to the dirty two-gap quasiclassical Usadel equations [47]. For example, a linear T-dependent H_{c2}(T) is observed in the multiband superconductor MgB_{2}, [48]. This suggests that SC in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} could be described by the Ginzburg-Landau theory in the dirty limit with nonmagnetic intraband and interband impurity scattering. Indeed, in polycrystalline PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, the mean-free path l_{\rm mfp} is estimated to be close to \xi(0) using the free electron theory, and l_{\rm mfp} is much smaller than the Pippard coherence length \xi_{p}\sim 360 nm [39].

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline  & Fit range & Model & Adj. R^{2} (x=0.3) & Adj. R^{2} (x=0.7) \\ \hline i & & asymptotic BCS + power-law & 0.98410 & 0.99207 \\ ii & base ^{*} to 0.3T_{c} & asymptotic BCS & 0.79138 & 0.89589 \\ iii & & T^{2}+T^{3} & 0.97762 & 0.99299 \\ iv & & power-law + BCS & 0.99932 & 0.99974 \\ v & base to T_{c} & BCS & 0.98163 & 0.97940 \\ vi & & two BCS terms & 0.99908 & 0.99948 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular} ^{\rm a}As mentioned in main text, base T is about 0.02T_{c}.

\end{table}

 However, it should be noted that results on single-crystalline PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} gives the mean-free path l_{\rm mfp}=103 nm using \gamma_{e} from specific heat and \rho from resistivity measurements [19]. This is much larger than the coherence length \xi(0), and suggests that PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} is in the local and clean limit [19]. It is therefore evidence that the linearity of H_{c2}(T) is not of dirty-limit two-band origin. We conclude that more work is required to understand this situation. But still, the most important indication of H_{c2}(T) is that Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} are multiband superconductors. We further find that the empirical anisotropic two-band model [49] can well describe H_{c2}(T):

\[H_{c2}(T)/H_{c2}(0)=\frac{1-(T/T_{c})^{2}}{1+(T/T_{c})^{2}}.\] (6)

Fit parameters \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)=1.75(1) T, 1.87(3) T, 1.80(3) T, and 1.73(3) T are derived for x=0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.7, respectively.

### Muon spin relaxation

#### 1.2.1 Zero-field \muSr

Figure 6 shows representative \muSR asymmetry spectra measured in ZF for Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, x=0.3 and 0.7, above and below T_{c}. A nonrelaxing background signal originating from muons that miss the sample and stop in the silver sample holder has been subtracted from the data. As in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[17, 20], no early-time oscillations or fast relaxation is observed, indicating the absence of strong static magnetism (with or without long-range order). The small additional relaxation below T_{c} indicates the emergence of a distribution of weak spontaneous local fields [31].

Figure 7 gives the temperature dependence of the Gaussian relaxation rate \Delta in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, x=0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9, obtained from fits of Eqs. (1) and (2) to the data. In the normal state, \Delta is temperature independent, as expected for muon depolarization by dipolar fields from quasistatic nuclear moments [31]. The enhancement of \Delta(T) with decreasing temperature below T_{c} is due to the onset of static local fields, and is strong evidence for broken TRS [1, 50]. With increasing La content the enhancement decreases, and disappears at x=1 where TRS is fully restored [17]. Our results for x=0 agree with those of Ref. [17].

This increase is of electronic origin, so the electronic and random nuclear contributions (\Delta_{e} and \Delta_{n}, respectively) are uncorrelated and add in quadrature [11]:

\[\Delta(T)=\left[\Delta_{n}^{2}+\Delta_{e}^{2}(T)\right]^{1/2}.\] (7)

The curves in Fig. 7 are fits of Eq. (7) to the data using the approximate empirical expression [51],

\[\Delta_{e}(T)=\Delta_{e}(0)\tanh\left(b\sqrt{\frac{T_{m}}{T}-1}\right)\quad(T \,<T_{m}),\] (8)

assuming that \Delta_{e} has the temperature dependence of a BCS-like OP but the transition temperature is T_{m} rather than T_{c}. In Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, the coefficient b (Table 1) is somewhat smaller than the isotropic BCS value of 1.74 in the weak coupling limit.

The dip followed by an increase in \Delta(T) below T_{c} (Fig. 7) was also noted in Ref. [17], and its reproducibility suggests that it is not an instrumental effect. Screening of magnetic impurity dipolar fields was proposed as its origin [17]. Later work [20] indicated that this mechanism is too weak to produce the effect, however, and its origin is not understood.

Figure 8(a) gives the T-x phase diagram for the Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} alloy system. Intriguingly, T_{m}<T_{c} for x\lesssim 0.5, as previously reported in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[17] where it is particularly obvious. The zero-temperature width \Delta_{e}(0)/\gamma_{\mu} of the broken-TRS field distribution [52] is shown in Fig. 8(b). It is interesting to note that \Delta_{e}(0)/\gamma_{\mu} and the pointlike node gap fraction from specific heat results [Fig. 8(b)] have the same x dependence, which is highly nonlinear compared to that in the Pr(Os_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{4}Sb_{12}, Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Os_{4}Sb_{12}, or Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} alloy systems [20, 33]. We thus speculate that the origin of the

Curves: Fits of Eqs. (7) and (8) assuming a BCS-like temperature dependence. Arrows: T_{c} from specific heat, T_{m} from onset of broken TRS.

  broken TRS in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is strongly correlated with the anisotropic gap structure. Noting that T_{m}<T_{c} for x\lesssim 0.5, we also speculate that interaction between neighboring Pr^{3+} ions contributes to the difference between T_{m} and T_{c}.

Figure 9 shows the ZF exponential damping rate \lambda(T) in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, x=0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9. In PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and Pr-rich alloys, there is a distinct maximum in \lambda(T) below T_{c}, followed by a decrease to a nonzero value as T\to 0. In the normal state above T_{c}, \lambda(T) increases with increasing temperature. The temperature-dependent features become smaller with increasing x, and for x=0.7 the rate is essentially temperature independent. For x=0.8, \lambda(T) increases with decreasing temperature below \sim5 K \approx 0.6T_{c}, and for x=0.9 there are not enough normal-state data to determine a temperature dependence. The La concentration dependence of the zero-field \lambda(T) in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (Fig. 9) is similar to that observed in Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, which is discussed in some detail by Zhang _et al._[20].

The maximum in \lambda(T) is accompanied by a dip in \Delta(T) at \simT_{c} (Fig. 7). The fit quality, denoted by \chi^{2}, is good for all the fits. This might be an effect of statistical correlation between the two parameters, but the dip in \Delta is still present when \lambda(T) is fixed in (poorer-quality) fits of Eqs. (1) and (2) to P_{\mu}(t).

Mechanisms for \lambda(T) are discussed further in Sec. III.3.3.

#### iii.3.2 Longitudinal-field \muSR

In ZF, the dynamic and static field contributions to the muon spin relaxation rate are hard to disentangle experimentally. The usual procedure for doping this is measurement of A_{\mu}(t) in a longitudinal field {\bf H}_{L} parallel to the initial muon spin polarization {\bf P}_{\mu}(0). For H_{L} much greater than static local fields at muon sites (\omega_{L}\gg\Delta), the resultant static field is nearly parallel to {\bf P}_{\mu}(0), so there is little static muon relaxation (precession and dephasing). Then {\bf P}_{\mu}(t) is said to be "decoupled" from the static local fields, and any remaining relaxation for high H_{L} is dynamic in origin, due to thermal fluctuation of the local fields.

A field dependence of the dynamic relaxation rate is also expected, due to the proportionality of \lambda to the fluctuation noise power at \omega_{L}; in general, this is reduced at high frequencies. If the fluctuations are characterized by a correlation time \tau_{c},\ \lambda(H_{L}) is given by the Redfield equation [53],

\[\lambda_{\rm LF}(H_{L})=\frac{\delta\omega_{\rm rms}^{2}\tau_{c}}{1+(\omega_{L }\tau_{c})^{2}},\] (9)

in the motionally narrowed limit \delta\omega_{\rm rms}\tau_{c}\ll 1, where \delta\omega_{\rm rms}=\gamma_{\mu}\langle\delta B_{\rm loc}^{2}(t)\rangle^{1/2} is the rms fluctuating local field amplitude in frequency units. Thus \lambda_{\rm LF}(H_{L}) decreases with increasing H_{L} for \omega_{L}\tau_{c}\gtrsim 1. This field dependence can be distinguished from decoupling if 1/\tau_{c} is sufficiently larger than the static rate \Delta.

LF\muSR experiments were carried out in the normal state (T=10 K) of Pr_{0.3}La_{0.7}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. Muon spin-polarization time spectra P_{\mu}(t), obtained from the asymmetry A_{\mu}(t) by subtracting the signal from the cold finger and normalizing, are shown in Fig. 10. The field dependence of P_{\mu}(t) shows characteristics of both decoupling and field-dependent dynamic relaxation: the small-amplitude oscillation with frequency \omega_{L} at intermediate fields is a feature of decoupling [31], but decoupling alone would not account for the nonzero field dependence of the overall relaxation rate at intermediate fields.

These data have been fit using Eqs. (1) and (3). The field dependence of \lambda_{\rm LF} for Pr_{0.3}La_{0.7}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} at 10 K is shown in Fig. 11. For \mu_{0}H_{L}\geqslant 0.5 mT, a good fit to Eq. (9) is obtained, which yields \tau_{c}=1.0(1)\,\mus and \delta B_{\rm rms}=0.29(1) mT. The motional-narrowing criterion \delta\omega_{\rm rms}\tau_{c}\ll 1 is more or less satisfied [\delta\omega_{\rm rms}\tau_{c}=0.25(3)], but the local field fluctuations

  are close to "adiabatic." The same behavior is observed in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}[11], with similar parameter values.

Values of the static rate \Delta and the ZF damping rate \lambda_{\rm ZF} are also shown in Fig. 11. The relation \Delta\tau_{c}\ll 1, necessary to separate decoupling and dynamic-rate field dependencies, is also more or less satisfied [\Delta\tau_{c}=0.14(1)]. The fit value \lambda_{\rm LF}(H_{L}\!\to\!0)=0.062(2)\,\mus^{-1} is less than \lambda_{\rm ZF}, suggesting a static contribution to the latter. This would indicate a so-called Voigtian static field distribution, i.e., the convolution of Gaussian and Lorentzian distributions [54]. An early report of a Voigtian distribution in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[17] was not reproduced in later studies [20].

#### iii.2.3 Mechanism for dynamic muon relaxation?

There are two candidate sources of fluctuating \mu^{+} local fields in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}; Pr^{3+}4f fluctuations and nuclear magnetism. There is no Pr^{3+} local moment, since the Pr^{3+} non-Kramers crystal-field ground state is nonmagnetic. Although 4f/conduction-band mixing is likely in these alloys, the \mu^{+} contact interaction with conduction or 4f electrons is normally weak and relaxation rates are too slow to be observed in the \muSR time window. This can be seen from an estimation of the conduction-electron hyperfine coupling constant \omega_{\rm hf} (or hyperfine field H_{\rm hf}=\omega_{\rm hf}/\gamma_{\mu}) needed to yield the observed \mu^{+} relaxation rate, since \lambda\approx\omega_{\rm hf}^{2}\tau_{c}, and for conduction-electron relaxation \tau_{c} is at the most of the order of \hbar/k_{B}T_{\rm F}\sim 10^{-13}\,s, where T_{\rm F}\sim 100\,K is the "Fermi temperature" from the specific heat of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[29] and associated with a putative 4f band. With the observed \lambda\sim 0.1\,\mus^{-1}, this yields \mu_{0}H_{\rm hf}\sim 1\,T, which is is an order of magnitude larger than typical muon/conduction-electron or muon/4f hyperfine fields in metals [55].

In Pr-rich alloys, ^{141}Pr nuclei are dominant. In PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, as in Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}[20], the \mu^{+}\,\lambda(T) resembles the ^{73}Ge NMR relaxation rate [18], and is similarly reminiscent of Hebel-Slichter relaxation [23] in fully gapped superconductors. This suggests ^{141}Pr spin fluctuations with correlation times \tau_{c} slower than the motionally narrowed limit, in which case \lambda\sim 1/\tau_{c}.

The Hebel-Slichter rate vanishes exponentially as T\to 0, whereas in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and its alloys the muon spin relaxation remains nonzero at low temperatures. We note, however, that mechanisms for fluctuating nuclear magnetism are of two kinds: spin-lattice (T_{1}) relaxation, due to interactions with the electronic environment, and spin-spin (T_{2}) relaxation, due to interactions between nuclei [56]. The latter are not expected to be temperature dependent at ordinary temperatures. Contributions of both mechanisms to nuclear spin fluctuations would be consistent with the observed behavior.

There is a problem with this scenario in Pr-rich alloys, however: The ^{141}Pr dipolar fields should be fluctuating fully (i.e., have no static component), in which case the "dynamic" K-T relaxation function [31] is appropriate. But as in Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}[20], fits to this function are not as good as fits using Eqs. (1) and (2). This is perhaps less of a difficulty for La-rich alloys, where ^{139}La nuclear spin fluctuations are expected to be much slower and could account for the static relaxation. The reduction with increasing x of the temperature dependence of \lambda (which is nearly T independent in Pr_{0.3}La_{0.7}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}) is consistent with this possibility, but the increased \lambda(T) below T_{c} for x=0.8 is not understood. The situation remains unclear, and more work needs to be done.

## IV Discussion

### Multiband superconductivity

We have shown that in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, upper critical fields H_{c2}(T) are consistent with two SC gaps. The two-band \alpha model is capable of describing the specific-heat results. We found that the larger-gap band has point nodes and the smaller-gap band is weakly coupled. The small fraction f of the BCS gap for x=0.3 and 0.7 suggests that SC of Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is dominated by the larger band with point nodes. Values of \Delta C_{p}/\gamma_{e}T_{c} for Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} are all slightly larger than the BCS value of 1.43, indicating that PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} is an unconventional superconductor. Pr-based filled skutterudites, including PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}[57, 58, 59], PrRu_{4}As_{12}

  [60], and PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}[59, 61], might all be multiband superconductors.

Transverse field \muSR results [16] concluded that in polycrystalline PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} the gap functions |\Delta_{0}sin\theta| and \Delta_{0}(1-sin^{4}\thetacos^{4}\theta), both with point nodes, can best describe the gap symmetry. These are also candidate gap functions for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}[62, 63]. However, a study of single-crystalline PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[19] reports two isotropic BCS gaps. While our H_{c2}(T) and C_{e}(T) results suggest multiband SC, point gap nodes in one band are favored by C_{e}(T) results, corresponding well to the \muSR study [16]. Still, we cannot rule out the possibility of multiple isotropic bands in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, since the fit quality is only delicately worse.

The discrepancy in C_{e}(T) between polycrystalline and single-crystalline PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} was previously attributed to the inaccurate subtraction of the nuclear Schottky anomaly at low temperature [19]. Although accurate subtraction is difficult, this only affects the analysis of C_{e}(T) at low temperatures, and fits over the entire temperature range <T_{c} yield evidence for point gap nodes. Furthermore, the Schottky anomaly is reduced and not observed in x> 0.5 alloys, whereas C_{e}(T)\proptoT^{3.1} is still found in Pr_{0.3}La_{0.7}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. High-quality single crystalline Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} samples will be required to clarify the origin of this discrepancy.

It should be mentioned that we did not observe any obvious specific heat jump around T_{m} in both x = 0 and x = 0.3 with a C_{e}(T) measurement T step \Delta T = 0.025 K. Moreover, C_{e}(T) anomaly at T_{m} was not reported in several previous works, including the single crystal study by Zhang _et al_. [19]. While our ZF-\muSR results provide strong indication of T_{m}<T_{c} in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}(see also discussion Sec. IV.2), the absence of multiple C_{e}(T) jumps put constraints on taking T_{m} as a second SC transition temperature. If there are multiple components in the SC OP of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, it is possible that one of the components that breaks TRS is not sufficient to generate an obvious C_{e} discontinuity at T_{m}. Further study on the nature of TRSB below T_{m} is desired.

### Broken time-reversal symmetry

In general, the violation of TRS naturally occurs in bulk superconductors with nonunitary states [1, 64]. Broken TRS can emerge at temperatures differing from T_{c}, such as in the E_{2n} odd-parity triplet state candidate UPt_{3}[9]. The appealing claim of spin-triplet chiral p wave states in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} was first anticipated from superfluid density results [16]. To date, other experimental confirmations of other implications are still lacking.

A singlet pairing state cannot be ruled out, due to the continuous variation of \delta B_{s}(x) as well as the smooth and small change of T_{c}(x) in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. These results suggest a continuous variation of OP symmetry between LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[17, 21], where LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is characterized by a spin-singlet state.

Broken TRS tends to be stabilized by the forming of a subdominant gap [64]. Thus, if a spin-singlet state is present in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, a straightforward explanation of broken TRS, point gap nodes together with a BCS gap, and T_{m}<T_{c} might be chirality in a superconducting state with an s-wave component [22], e.g., the d+is state [64]. Then supercurrents form around non-magnetic imperfections, resulting in local fields and the enhancement of \Delta(T) below T_{m}[17, 65]. A subdominant s-wave component in the SC OP of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} results in the two-consecutive SC phase feature [64, 66].

It was observed [40] that in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} the critical current density I_{c} decreases exponentially with increasing applied field and decreases linearly with increasing temperature. The absence of an anomaly in I_{c}(H) around T_{m} indicates no macroscopic separation of multiple SC phases [39], but is not evidence against the claim of multiple components in the SC OP.

The model of Koga, Matsumoto, and Shiba (KMS) [67], which proposed several T_{h} symmetric irreducible representations for isostructural PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, suggests that in this compound SC with broken TRS is driven by crystal-field excitonic Cooper-pairing [33]. With increasing La concentration, the weakened Pr-Pr intersite interaction results in a crossover between SC ground states with broken and preserved TRS due to less excitonic dispersion, resulting in a monotonic decrease in \delta B_{s}(x) in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Os_{4}Sb_{12}[33].

To some extent, Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} resembles Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Os_{4}Sb_{12}, since both end compounds are superconductors and they both exhibit a continuous decrease in \delta B_{s} on increasing x. Considering the small variation of T_{c} and the smooth evolution of \delta B_{s}(x) in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, the KMS model might be applicable to describe the SC OP in this alloy series. Sergienko and Curne [68] also proposed a singlet-state model for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, based on the assumptions of point gap nodes as well as equivalent OP between the TRS breaking SC phase and the TRS-preserved one. These assumptions are compatible with our results in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}. In this case, the absence of multiple SC specific heat jumps in tetrahedral Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is a reflection of orbital components in the OP, and the broken TRS originates from a complex orbitally degenerate OP in the spin-singlet state within the strong SOC limit [17, 68].

It should be mentioned that orbital degrees of freedom further complicate the origin of the SC excitation gap. It was found that even-parity superconductors with broken TRS have multiband OP [1, 69]. These superconductors are characteristic of two-dimensional Fermi surfaces, with nodes in the gap replaced by Bogoliubov quasiparticles. PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} could be such a candidate material, considering the broken TRS state with multiband feature. Moreover, it was recently proposed that three-dimensional chiral superconductors with strong SOC and odd-parity states can be the host of gapless Majorana fermions [22]. PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} was proposed as a candidate for such a system, due to the existence of point gap nodes, broken TRS, and a possible spin-triplet state. Isostructural PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} was also proposed to be a candidate material. The two-band feature is not evidence against a nonunitary state [22]. We thus note here that the origin of the multiband feature with nodal gap structure and broken TRS in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} remains an unsolved problem.

## V Concluding remarks

We report specific heat, critical field, ZF-, and LF-\muSR studies of well-characterized polycrystalline superconducting Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, to investigate the SC OP of the parent  compound PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}. There is no obvious SC pair breaking effect in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, since T_{c}(x) varies only slightly. We find that Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} alloys exhibit broken TRS, with a signature local field distribution width \delta B_{s} below T_{c} that continuously decreases with increasing x, disappearing for x\sim 1. This behavior is a reflection of a crossover between broken and preserved TRS SC across the alloy series, similar to Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. The most intriguing feature is that the onset temperatures T_{m} for broken TRS in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (x\lesssim 0.5) are below T_{c}, as is most obvious in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}. Furthermore, H_{c1}(T) exhibits a second quadratic temperature region below T_{q}\approx T_{m}\sim 6 K. These results are likely due to the intrinsic two-consecutive-SC-phase nature of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}. Critical fields H_{c2}(T) and the specific heat C_{e}(T) in Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} can be well described by a two-band model, with C_{e}(T) suggesting a dominant point-node gap structure in the pairing symmetry. However, there are no obvious multiple SC specific-heat jumps at T_{m}. Based on these results, we conclude that PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} is likely to be a multiband superconductor characterized by a complex multicomponent SC OP with orbitally degenerate representations. Our results motivate further studies of SC excitation gap symmetry in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and isostructural compounds, including PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}. Transverse-field \muSR experiments in the vortex-lattice state, which yield the superfluid density, will help to determine the gap symmetry and are planned for the future. We conclude that Pr_{1-x}La_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is a unique candidate for further study of unconventional SC with intrinsic multiple phases.
