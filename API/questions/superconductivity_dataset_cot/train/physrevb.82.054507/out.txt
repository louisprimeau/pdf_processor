###### Abstract

The zero-temperature value of the in-plane London penetration depth, \lambda_{ab}(0), has been measured in single crystals of Ba(Fe1-_x_Co_x_)2As2 as a function of the Co concentration, x, across both the underdoped and overdoped superconducting regions of the phase diagram. For x \leq 0.047, \lambda_{ab}(0) has been found to have values between 120 \pm 50 and 300 \pm 50 nm. A pronounced increase in \lambda_{ab}(0), to a value as high as 950 \pm 50 nm, has been observed for x \leq 0.047, corresponding to the region of the phase diagram where the itinerant antiferromagnetic and superconducting phases coexist and compete. Direct determination of the doping-dependent \lambda_{ab}(0) has allowed us to track the evolution of the temperature-dependent superfluid density, from which we infer the development of a pronounced superconducting gap anisotropy at the edges of the superconducting dome.

## II Experimental

### London penetration depth

The experimental apparatus used for obtaining all of the penetration depth measurements in this work was a TDR.[20] The essential components of the TDR are a tank circuit formed by an inductor and a capacitor, which has a resonance frequency f_{0}=1/2\pi\sqrt{LC}\approx14 MHz, and a tunnel diode. While the diode is biased appropriately it serves as an ac power source for the tank circuit. To perform penetration depth measurements, the sample is mounted on a sapphire stage and inserted into the inductor coil. The magnetic field of the coil, which is =10 mOe, is screened by the sample and thus changes the inductance, L, and therefore also the resonance frequency by an amount \Delta f. By utilizing \Delta f(T) =-G4\pi\chi(T)=G{1-[\lambda(T)/R]tanh[R/\lambda(T)]}, the TDR is capable of measuring the variation in the penetration depth in a superconductor, \Delta\lambda(T)=\lambda(T)-\lambda(0), with a resolution of nearly 1 A, where G is a geometry-dependent calibration factor depending on the coil volume, sample volume, demagnetization, and empty coil resonance frequency. This calibration factor is measured directly by extracting the sample from the inductor coil at its base temperature.

The TDR technique, as described above, provides very precise measurements of the variation in the penetration depth, \Delta\lambda(T), but not the absolute value due to reasons described in detail in Ref. 21. However, as proposed in the same reference, the TDR technique can be extended to obtain the absolute value of the penetration depth, \lambda(T). The key to obtaining \lambda(0) from TDR measurements is to coat the entire surface of the superconductor under study with a thin film of a conventional superconductor having a lower critical temperature and a known value of \lambda(0), which in this work was aluminum. For this study, the aluminum films that were used to coat the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} samples had T_{c}^{\rm Al}\approx 1.2 K and thicknesses of 100 nm, as shown in Fig. 1.

While the Al film is superconducting it participates with the coated superconductor to screen the magnetic field generated by the TDR coil. However, when it becomes normal it does effectively no screening because its thickness, t, is much less than the normal-state skin depth at the TDR operating frequency of 14 MHz, where \delta_{\rm Al}\approx 75 \mum for \rho_{0}^{\rm Al} =10 \mu\Omega cm.[22] By measuring the frequency shift upon warming from T_{\rm min}, which is the base temperature of the sample, to T>T_{c}^{\rm Al} we obtain the quantity L=\lambda_{\it eff}(T_{\rm c}^{\rm Al}) -\lambda_{\it eff}(T_{\rm min}), shown in Fig. 2. This quantity can be used to calculate \lambda(0) along with the previously determined power-law relation for iron-based superconductors,[23]\Delta\lambda(T)=\beta T^{\rm n}, and by using the formula for the effective magnetic penetration depth into both the Al film and the coated superconductor for T<T_{c}^{\rm Al}, which is given by

\[\lambda_{\it eff}(T)=\lambda_{\rm Al}(T)\frac{\lambda(T)+\lambda_{\rm Al}(T){ \rm tanh}\frac{t}{\lambda_{\rm Al}(T)}}{\lambda_{\rm Al}(T)+\lambda(T){\rm tanh} \frac{t}{\lambda_{\rm Al}(T)}},\] (1)

where \lambda(T) is the penetration depth of the coated superconductor and \lambda_{\rm Al}(T) is the penetration depth of the Al film. As usual with the TDR technique, the variation in the penetration depth with temperature, \Delta\lambda_{\it eff}(T)=\lambda_{\it eff}(T)-\lambda_{\it eff}(T_{\rm min}), is measured. This method has been successfully demonstrated on several cuprate superconductors[21] and has shown agreement with measurements of \lambda(0) in Fe_{1+y}(Te_{1-x}Se_{x}) crystals obtained by different techniques.[24] Here we use an extended analysis obtained by solving the appropriate boundary value problem.

The aluminum film was deposited onto each sample while it was suspended from a rotating stage by a fine wire in an argon atmosphere of a magnetron sputtering system. The formation of nonuniform regions in the film was avoided by bonding the wire to only a portion of the narrowest edge of each sample. Each film thickness was checked using a scanning electron microscope in two ways, both of which are shown in Fig. 1. The first method involved breaking a coated

Inset: zoomed in low-temperature region, T_{\rm min}\approxT\approxT_{c}^{\rm Al}, before (green triangles) and after (red circles) the Al coating on the same sample. The overall frequency shift through the Al transition, denoted as L, is used for the calculation of \lambda_{\rm afl}(0).

 sample after all measurements had been performed to expose its cross section. After this, it was mounted on a scanning electron microscope (SEM) sample holder using silver paste, shown in Fig. 1(a). The images of the broken edge are shown for two different zoom levels in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c). The second method used a focused-ion beam (FIB) to make a trench on the surface of a coated sample, with the trench depth being much greater than the Al coating thickness, shown in Fig. 1(d). The sample was then tilted and imaged by the SEM that is built into the FIB system, shown in Fig. 1(e).

### Samples

The samples used for this study were members of the Ba(Fe1-xC0)2As2 series and were obtained from the same source as in Ref. [3] using the same growth procedure. The samples from these batches were characterized by magnetization and resistivity measurements, which showed a robust superconducting response with sharp transitions. In addition, magneto-optical imaging was used to probe the mesoscopic (in)homogeneity of the samples, at least down to a length scale of 1 \mum. [25]

The Co concentrations were determined by electron-probe x-ray microanalysis using wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS). The absolute uncertainty of the Co concentration, _x_WBCs, within each batch can be as high as +-0.0015. At the edges of the superconducting dome where _T_c changes quickly with x, this uncertainty is not negligible and brings about sizable variations in _T_c, as can be seen in Table 1, for concentrations that are nominally the same. On the other hand, the distribution of doping within each sample would broaden the transition and we have selected the samples in which the transition widths were sharp and comparable across the superconducting dome. Therefore, the transition temperature is the better criterion of the actual doping level and even if we do not know it precisely, we can use _T_c to differentiate between the samples. For highly overdoped samples, the superconducting transitions are quite broad and we could not find samples with widths comparable to the optimally doped ones. This is the reason why highly overdoped samples were not included in this study. Table 1 summarizes the properties of the samples used in this study.

## III Results and Discussion

The values of _位ab_(0) that were obtained using the procedure described above for the Ba(Fe1-xC0)2As2 system are shown in the top panel of Fig. 3 for doping levels, x, across the superconducting region of the phase diagram, shown schematically in the bottom panel of Fig. 3. The size of the error bars for the _位ab_(0) points was determined by considering the film thickness to be t = 100 +- 10 nm and _位Al_(0) = 50 +- 10 nm. The discrepancy in _位ab_(0) for the two samples having x = 0.038 is clearly beyond these error bars and may possibly arise from cracks or inhomogeneities in the Al film, even though great care was taken to eliminate them during the coating process. Thus, the error bars represent the uncertainty of the known parameters and the scatter in the data may arise from uncontrolled effects such as cracks or inhomogeneities in the aluminum films. The discrepancy for the two x = 0.038 samples could also arise from the uncertainty in knowing the actual Co concentrations, which is supported by the sizable variation in _T_c, shown in Table 1. The scatter in the _位ab_(0) values shown in the upper panel of Fig. 3 has an approximately constant value of +-0.075 \mum for all values of x, which probably indicates that the source of the scatter is the same for all samples. For comparison, Fig. 3 also shows

[18]) and optical reflectivity (purple stars),[19] all in the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{3})_{2}As_{2} system, most of which are consistent with our results within the scatter. It may also be important to note that the \lambda_{ab}(0) values from other experiments are all on the high side of the scatter that exists within the TDR \lambda_{ab}(0) data set. This is because any cracks or voids in the Al film will lead to underestimated values of \lambda_{ab}(0). We note that we did not observe an increase in \lambda_{ab}(0) toward the overdoped regime as reported from \muSR measurements,[17] although our values at the optimal doping do agree well.

Specifically, an increase in \lambda_{ab}(0) on the underdoped side below x = 0.047 has been observed, which is in the region where the itinerant antiferromagnetic and superconducting phases coexist, as is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 3. The dependence of \lambda_{ab}(0) on carrier concentration is \lambda_{ab}(0)\propto 1/\sqrt{n_{s}(0)}, where n_{s} is the superfluid density, which is equal to the normal-state carrier concentration in the clean case. The proportionality between \lambda_{ab}(0) and n_{s}(0) still holds if scattering is included but n_{s} is reduced due to a residual density of states within the gap. Overall, an increase in \lambda_{ab}(0) is consistent with a decrease in the superfluid carrier concentration. There is compelling evidence suggesting that the itinerant antiferromagnetic spin-density wave state in these materials acts to gap a portion of the Fermi surface,[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] which would remove mobile charge carriers and this qualitative idea is consistent with our experimental observations of the doping dependence of \lambda_{ab}(0). Changes in the Hall coefficient for these materials, moving from the pure superconducting region to the coexistence region, have also been interpreted as being due to the interaction between these phases.[26, 27] It has been shown that the opening of a superconducting gap in the antiferromagnetic state transfers optical spectral weight from a mid-infrared peak to a Drude peak, even when the reconstructed Fermi surface would be fully gapped.[28] As a result, the coexistence state has a finite n_{s}, although smaller than in the pure superconducting state.

In order to provide a more quantitative explanation for the observed increase in \lambda_{ab}(0) as x decreases in the underdoped region, we have considered the case of s^{\pm} superconductivity coexisting with itinerant antiferromagnetism.[9] For the case of particle-hole symmetry (nested bands), the zero-temperature value of the in-plane penetration depth in the region where the two phases coexist is

\[\lambda_{ab}^{SC+SDW}(0)=\lambda_{ab}^{0}(0)\sqrt{1+\frac{\Delta_{AF}^{2}}{ \Delta_{0}^{2}}},\] (2)

where \lambda_{ab}^{0}(0) is the value for a pure superconducting system with no magnetism present, and \Delta_{AF} and \Delta_{0} are the zero-temperature values of the antiferromagnetic and superconducting gaps, respectively. Deviations from particle-hole symmetry lead to a smaller increase in \lambda_{ab}^{SC+SDW}(0), making the result in Eq. (2) an upper estimate. For more information on the details of the calculation and the values of \Delta_{AF} and \Delta_{0} used, see Refs. [9] and [28].

The three blue dashed lines shown in the top panel of Fig. 3, which were produced using Eq. (2), show the expected increase in \lambda_{ab}(0) in the region of coexisting phases below x = 0.047 by normalizing to three different values of \lambda_{ab}(0) in the pure superconducting state, with those being 120, 180, and 270 nm. This theory does not take into account changes in the pure superconducting state, so for x > 0.047 the dashed blue lines are horizontal. These theoretical curves were produced using parameters that agree with the phase diagram in the bottom panel of Fig. 3,[9], which includes a shift of the coexistence region to lower values of x by an amount of 0.012, and given the simplifications of the model, the agreement with the experimental observations is quite reasonable. A possible reason for the required shift of 0.012 in the theoretical curves could be that the scatter in the measured values of \lambda_{ab}(0) is too large.

While the exact functional form was not provided by any physical motivation and merely serves as a guide to the eye, the solid gray line in Fig. 3 is a fit of the TDR \lambda_{ab}(0) data to a function of the form A+B/x^{2}, which does indeed show a dramatic increase in \lambda_{ab}(0) in the coexistence region and also a relatively slight change in the pure superconducting phase. It should be noted that a dramatic increase in \lambda_{ab}(0) below x \approx 0.047 cannot be explained by impurity scattering, which would only lead to relatively small corrections in \lambda(T).

Values of \lambda_{ab}(0) obtained here can be used to calculate the actual penetration depth, \lambda_{ab}(T) = \Delta\lambda_{ab}(T) + \lambda_{ab}(0), where \Delta\lambda_{ab}(T) has been measured for each Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} crystal used in this study before Al coating.[30, 31] In the top panel of Fig. 4, we examine \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) \propto n_{s}(T)/m^{*} as a function of temperature in underdoped, optimally doped, and overdoped samples, where the values of \lambda_{ab}(0) used are the corresponding values shown in Fig. 3 and Table I. Shown in the top panel of Fig. 4 are an underdoped sample with T_{c}=7.4 K (x=0.038, sample no. 1), a sample close to optimal doping with T_{c}=22.8 K (x=0.074, sample no. 10), and an overdoped sample with T_{c}=17.2 K (x=0.1, sample no. 13). There is a clear evolution toward higher superfluid density approaching optimal doping. Now we can construct the normalized superfluid density to analyze the superconducting gap.

Using the same penetration depth data that was used in the top panel of Fig. 4, we construct the normalized superfluid density (phase stiffness), \rho_{s}(T) = [\lambda(0)/\lambda(T)]^{2}, which is commonly used to analyze penetration depth data and a quantity which is fairly easy to calculate for an arbitrary gap structure. The bottom panel in Fig. 4 shows \rho_{s}(T) for the same samples shown in the top panel. Also shown for comparison are the \rho_{s}(T) curves for a single-band s-wave superconductor (dotted blue line) and a d-wave superconductor (dotted gray line), both in the clean limit. From Fig. 4, \rho_{s}(T\rightarrow 0) and \rho_{s}(T\rightarrow T_{c}) behave quite differently for the members of the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} series compared to the standard, single-gap s-wave and d-wave clean limit cases. Impurity scattering would turn the d-wave curve quadratic at low temperatures while leaving s-wave almost intact.

The data for all doping levels show an overall similar trend of the evolution of \rho_{s}(T) across the phase diagram. A special feature of these curves is the upward concavity just below T_{c}. This behavior suggests that below T_{c} the superconducting gap develops slower than it does in the case of a  single gap, which implies two-gap superconductivity.[32] Furthermore, the normalized \rho_{s}(T) for the optimally doped sample over the entire temperature range stays above the curves for both heavily underdoped and overdoped samples, though in the latter case the difference is on the order of the statistical error in the measured values of \lambda_{ab}(0) (see Fig. 3). This distinction between the different Co-doping compositions suggests that the gap anisotropy, which is generally considered as being either the actual angular variation in k space and/or the development of an imbalance between the gaps on different sheets of the Fermi surface, increases when we depart either way from the optimal doping. Although our measurements do not go into the far overdoped regime, these results are consistent with the measurements of the specific-heat jump[33] and the residual density of states.[34] as well as with measurements of thermal conductivity,[35, 36] In particular, thermal-conductivity measurements with heat flow along the c-axis actually suggest that nodal regions develop in the superconducting gap in heavily underdoped and overdoped compositions. This, in turn, is consistent with measurements of \lambda_{c} in a closely related Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ni_{x})_{2}As_{2}, where c-axis nodes were suggested.[37]

## IV Conclusion

In conclusion, the zero-temperature value of the in-plane London penetration depth, \lambda_{ab}(0), has been measured for the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} series across the superconducting "dome" of the phase diagram using an Al coating technique along with TDR measurements. There is a clear increase in \lambda_{ab}(0) below x\approx 0.047, which is consistent with a reduction in the superfluid density due to the competition between itinerant antiferromagnetism and superconductivity for the same electrons. The measured values of \lambda_{ab}(0) were used to construct the normalized superfluid density (phase stiffness), \rho_{s}(T), and study its evolution with doping. The upward concavity of \rho_{s}(T) just below T_{c} for samples across the superconducting dome of the phase diagram implies the importance of two-gap effects for all doping levels. A notable suppression of \rho_{s} for heavily underdoped and some suppression for slightly overdoped samples with respect to samples with optimal doping suggests a developing anisotropy of the superconducting gap toward the edges of the superconducting dome, consistent with the behavior found in specific-heat and thermal-conductivity studies.

###### Abstract

The zero-temperature value of the in-plane London penetration depth, \lambda_{ab}(0), has been measured in single crystals of Ba(Fe1-_x_Co_x_)2As2 as a function of the Co concentration, x, across both the underdoped and overdoped superconducting regions of the phase diagram. For x \leq 0.047, \lambda_{ab}(0) has been found to have values between 120 \pm 50 and 300 \pm 50 nm. A pronounced increase in \lambda_{ab}(0), to a value as high as 950 \pm 50 nm, has been observed for x \leq 0.047, corresponding to the region of the phase diagram where the itinerant antiferromagnetic and superconducting phases coexist and compete. Direct determination of the doping-dependent \lambda_{ab}(0) has allowed us to track the evolution of the temperature-dependent superfluid density, from which we infer the development of a pronounced superconducting gap anisotropy at the edges of the superconducting dome.

## II Experimental

### London penetration depth

The experimental apparatus used for obtaining all of the penetration depth measurements in this work was a TDR.[20] The essential components of the TDR are a tank circuit formed by an inductor and a capacitor, which has a resonance frequency f_{0}=1/2\pi\sqrt{LC}\approx14 MHz, and a tunnel diode. While the diode is biased appropriately it serves as an ac power source for the tank circuit. To perform penetration depth measurements, the sample is mounted on a sapphire stage and inserted into the inductor coil. The magnetic field of the coil, which is =10 mOe, is screened by the sample and thus changes the inductance, L, and therefore also the resonance frequency by an amount \Delta f. By utilizing \Delta f(T) =-G4\pi\chi(T)=G{1-[\lambda(T)/R]tanh[R/\lambda(T)]}, the TDR is capable of measuring the variation in the penetration depth in a superconductor, \Delta\lambda(T)=\lambda(T)-\lambda(0), with a resolution of nearly 1 A, where G is a geometry-dependent calibration factor depending on the coil volume, sample volume, demagnetization, and empty coil resonance frequency. This calibration factor is measured directly by extracting the sample from the inductor coil at its base temperature.

The TDR technique, as described above, provides very precise measurements of the variation in the penetration depth, \Delta\lambda(T), but not the absolute value due to reasons described in detail in Ref. 21. However, as proposed in the same reference, the TDR technique can be extended to obtain the absolute value of the penetration depth, \lambda(T). The key to obtaining \lambda(0) from TDR measurements is to coat the entire surface of the superconductor under study with a thin film of a conventional superconductor having a lower critical temperature and a known value of \lambda(0), which in this work was aluminum. For this study, the aluminum films that were used to coat the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} samples had T_{c}^{\rm Al}\approx 1.2 K and thicknesses of 100 nm, as shown in Fig. 1.

While the Al film is superconducting it participates with the coated superconductor to screen the magnetic field generated by the TDR coil. However, when it becomes normal it does effectively no screening because its thickness, t, is much less than the normal-state skin depth at the TDR operating frequency of 14 MHz, where \delta_{\rm Al}\approx 75 \mum for \rho_{0}^{\rm Al} =10 \mu\Omega cm.[22] By measuring the frequency shift upon warming from T_{\rm min}, which is the base temperature of the sample, to T>T_{c}^{\rm Al} we obtain the quantity L=\lambda_{\it eff}(T_{\rm c}^{\rm Al}) -\lambda_{\it eff}(T_{\rm min}), shown in Fig. 2. This quantity can be used to calculate \lambda(0) along with the previously determined power-law relation for iron-based superconductors,[23]\Delta\lambda(T)=\beta T^{\rm n}, and by using the formula for the effective magnetic penetration depth into both the Al film and the coated superconductor for T<T_{c}^{\rm Al}, which is given by

\[\lambda_{\it eff}(T)=\lambda_{\rm Al}(T)\frac{\lambda(T)+\lambda_{\rm Al}(T){ \rm tanh}\frac{t}{\lambda_{\rm Al}(T)}}{\lambda_{\rm Al}(T)+\lambda(T){\rm tanh} \frac{t}{\lambda_{\rm Al}(T)}},\] (1)

where \lambda(T) is the penetration depth of the coated superconductor and \lambda_{\rm Al}(T) is the penetration depth of the Al film. As usual with the TDR technique, the variation in the penetration depth with temperature, \Delta\lambda_{\it eff}(T)=\lambda_{\it eff}(T)-\lambda_{\it eff}(T_{\rm min}), is measured. This method has been successfully demonstrated on several cuprate superconductors[21] and has shown agreement with measurements of \lambda(0) in Fe_{1+y}(Te_{1-x}Se_{x}) crystals obtained by different techniques.[24] Here we use an extended analysis obtained by solving the appropriate boundary value problem.

The aluminum film was deposited onto each sample while it was suspended from a rotating stage by a fine wire in an argon atmosphere of a magnetron sputtering system. The formation of nonuniform regions in the film was avoided by bonding the wire to only a portion of the narrowest edge of each sample. Each film thickness was checked using a scanning electron microscope in two ways, both of which are shown in Fig. 1. The first method involved breaking a coated

Inset: zoomed in low-temperature region, T_{\rm min}\approxT\approxT_{c}^{\rm Al}, before (green triangles) and after (red circles) the Al coating on the same sample. The overall frequency shift through the Al transition, denoted as L, is used for the calculation of \lambda_{\rm afl}(0).

 sample after all measurements had been performed to expose its cross section. After this, it was mounted on a scanning electron microscope (SEM) sample holder using silver paste, shown in Fig. 1(a). The images of the broken edge are shown for two different zoom levels in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c). The second method used a focused-ion beam (FIB) to make a trench on the surface of a coated sample, with the trench depth being much greater than the Al coating thickness, shown in Fig. 1(d). The sample was then tilted and imaged by the SEM that is built into the FIB system, shown in Fig. 1(e).

### Samples

The samples used for this study were members of the Ba(Fe1-xC0)2As2 series and were obtained from the same source as in Ref. [3] using the same growth procedure. The samples from these batches were characterized by magnetization and resistivity measurements, which showed a robust superconducting response with sharp transitions. In addition, magneto-optical imaging was used to probe the mesoscopic (in)homogeneity of the samples, at least down to a length scale of 1 \mum. [25]

The Co concentrations were determined by electron-probe x-ray microanalysis using wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS). The absolute uncertainty of the Co concentration, _x_WBCs, within each batch can be as high as +-0.0015. At the edges of the superconducting dome where _T_c changes quickly with x, this uncertainty is not negligible and brings about sizable variations in _T_c, as can be seen in Table 1, for concentrations that are nominally the same. On the other hand, the distribution of doping within each sample would broaden the transition and we have selected the samples in which the transition widths were sharp and comparable across the superconducting dome. Therefore, the transition temperature is the better criterion of the actual doping level and even if we do not know it precisely, we can use _T_c to differentiate between the samples. For highly overdoped samples, the superconducting transitions are quite broad and we could not find samples with widths comparable to the optimally doped ones. This is the reason why highly overdoped samples were not included in this study. Table 1 summarizes the properties of the samples used in this study.

## III Results and Discussion

The values of _位ab_(0) that were obtained using the procedure described above for the Ba(Fe1-xC0)2As2 system are shown in the top panel of Fig. 3 for doping levels, x, across the superconducting region of the phase diagram, shown schematically in the bottom panel of Fig. 3. The size of the error bars for the _位ab_(0) points was determined by considering the film thickness to be t = 100 +- 10 nm and _位Al_(0) = 50 +- 10 nm. The discrepancy in _位ab_(0) for the two samples having x = 0.038 is clearly beyond these error bars and may possibly arise from cracks or inhomogeneities in the Al film, even though great care was taken to eliminate them during the coating process. Thus, the error bars represent the uncertainty of the known parameters and the scatter in the data may arise from uncontrolled effects such as cracks or inhomogeneities in the aluminum films. The discrepancy for the two x = 0.038 samples could also arise from the uncertainty in knowing the actual Co concentrations, which is supported by the sizable variation in _T_c, shown in Table 1. The scatter in the _位ab_(0) values shown in the upper panel of Fig. 3 has an approximately constant value of +-0.075 \mum for all values of x, which probably indicates that the source of the scatter is the same for all samples. For comparison, Fig. 3 also shows

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} Sample & _x_WBCs & _T_c (K) & _位_(0) \\

3 & 0.042 & 15.5 & 935 \\

[18]) and optical reflectivity (purple stars),[19] all in the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{3})_{2}As_{2} system, most of which are consistent with our results within the scatter. It may also be important to note that the \lambda_{ab}(0) values from other experiments are all on the high side of the scatter that exists within the TDR \lambda_{ab}(0) data set. This is because any cracks or voids in the Al film will lead to underestimated values of \lambda_{ab}(0). We note that we did not observe an increase in \lambda_{ab}(0) toward the overdoped regime as reported from \muSR measurements,[17] although our values at the optimal doping do agree well.

Specifically, an increase in \lambda_{ab}(0) on the underdoped side below x = 0.047 has been observed, which is in the region where the itinerant antiferromagnetic and superconducting phases coexist, as is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 3. The dependence of \lambda_{ab}(0) on carrier concentration is \lambda_{ab}(0)\propto 1/\sqrt{n_{s}(0)}, where n_{s} is the superfluid density, which is equal to the normal-state carrier concentration in the clean case. The proportionality between \lambda_{ab}(0) and n_{s}(0) still holds if scattering is included but n_{s} is reduced due to a residual density of states within the gap. Overall, an increase in \lambda_{ab}(0) is consistent with a decrease in the superfluid carrier concentration. There is compelling evidence suggesting that the itinerant antiferromagnetic spin-density wave state in these materials acts to gap a portion of the Fermi surface,[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] which would remove mobile charge carriers and this qualitative idea is consistent with our experimental observations of the doping dependence of \lambda_{ab}(0). Changes in the Hall coefficient for these materials, moving from the pure superconducting region to the coexistence region, have also been interpreted as being due to the interaction between these phases.[26, 27] It has been shown that the opening of a superconducting gap in the antiferromagnetic state transfers optical spectral weight from a mid-infrared peak to a Drude peak, even when the reconstructed Fermi surface would be fully gapped.[28] As a result, the coexistence state has a finite n_{s}, although smaller than in the pure superconducting state.

In order to provide a more quantitative explanation for the observed increase in \lambda_{ab}(0) as x decreases in the underdoped region, we have considered the case of s^{\pm} superconductivity coexisting with itinerant antiferromagnetism.[9] For the case of particle-hole symmetry (nested bands), the zero-temperature value of the in-plane penetration depth in the region where the two phases coexist is

\[\lambda_{ab}^{SC+SDW}(0)=\lambda_{ab}^{0}(0)\sqrt{1+\frac{\Delta_{AF}^{2}}{ \Delta_{0}^{2}}},\] (2)

where \lambda_{ab}^{0}(0) is the value for a pure superconducting system with no magnetism present, and \Delta_{AF} and \Delta_{0} are the zero-temperature values of the antiferromagnetic and superconducting gaps, respectively. Deviations from particle-hole symmetry lead to a smaller increase in \lambda_{ab}^{SC+SDW}(0), making the result in Eq. (2) an upper estimate. For more information on the details of the calculation and the values of \Delta_{AF} and \Delta_{0} used, see Refs. [9] and [28].

The three blue dashed lines shown in the top panel of Fig. 3, which were produced using Eq. (2), show the expected increase in \lambda_{ab}(0) in the region of coexisting phases below x = 0.047 by normalizing to three different values of \lambda_{ab}(0) in the pure superconducting state, with those being 120, 180, and 270 nm. This theory does not take into account changes in the pure superconducting state, so for x > 0.047 the dashed blue lines are horizontal. These theoretical curves were produced using parameters that agree with the phase diagram in the bottom panel of Fig. 3,[9], which includes a shift of the coexistence region to lower values of x by an amount of 0.012, and given the simplifications of the model, the agreement with the experimental observations is quite reasonable. A possible reason for the required shift of 0.012 in the theoretical curves could be that the scatter in the measured values of \lambda_{ab}(0) is too large.

While the exact functional form was not provided by any physical motivation and merely serves as a guide to the eye, the solid gray line in Fig. 3 is a fit of the TDR \lambda_{ab}(0) data to a function of the form A+B/x^{2}, which does indeed show a dramatic increase in \lambda_{ab}(0) in the coexistence region and also a relatively slight change in the pure superconducting phase. It should be noted that a dramatic increase in \lambda_{ab}(0) below x \approx 0.047 cannot be explained by impurity scattering, which would only lead to relatively small corrections in \lambda(T).

Values of \lambda_{ab}(0) obtained here can be used to calculate the actual penetration depth, \lambda_{ab}(T) = \Delta\lambda_{ab}(T) + \lambda_{ab}(0), where \Delta\lambda_{ab}(T) has been measured for each Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} crystal used in this study before Al coating.[30, 31] In the top panel of Fig. 4, we examine \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) \propto n_{s}(T)/m^{*} as a function of temperature in underdoped, optimally doped, and overdoped samples, where the values of \lambda_{ab}(0) used are the corresponding values shown in Fig. 3 and Table I. Shown in the top panel of Fig. 4 are an underdoped sample with T_{c}=7.4 K (x=0.038, sample no. 1), a sample close to optimal doping with T_{c}=22.8 K (x=0.074, sample no. 10), and an overdoped sample with T_{c}=17.2 K (x=0.1, sample no. 13). There is a clear evolution toward higher superfluid density approaching optimal doping. Now we can construct the normalized superfluid density to analyze the superconducting gap.

Using the same penetration depth data that was used in the top panel of Fig. 4, we construct the normalized superfluid density (phase stiffness), \rho_{s}(T) = [\lambda(0)/\lambda(T)]^{2}, which is commonly used to analyze penetration depth data and a quantity which is fairly easy to calculate for an arbitrary gap structure. The bottom panel in Fig. 4 shows \rho_{s}(T) for the same samples shown in the top panel. Also shown for comparison are the \rho_{s}(T) curves for a single-band s-wave superconductor (dotted blue line) and a d-wave superconductor (dotted gray line), both in the clean limit. From Fig. 4, \rho_{s}(T\rightarrow 0) and \rho_{s}(T\rightarrow T_{c}) behave quite differently for the members of the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} series compared to the standard, single-gap s-wave and d-wave clean limit cases. Impurity scattering would turn the d-wave curve quadratic at low temperatures while leaving s-wave almost intact.

The data for all doping levels show an overall similar trend of the evolution of \rho_{s}(T) across the phase diagram. A special feature of these curves is the upward concavity just below T_{c}. This behavior suggests that below T_{c} the superconducting gap develops slower than it does in the case of a  single gap, which implies two-gap superconductivity.[32] Furthermore, the normalized \rho_{s}(T) for the optimally doped sample over the entire temperature range stays above the curves for both heavily underdoped and overdoped samples, though in the latter case the difference is on the order of the statistical error in the measured values of \lambda_{ab}(0) (see Fig. 3). This distinction between the different Co-doping compositions suggests that the gap anisotropy, which is generally considered as being either the actual angular variation in k space and/or the development of an imbalance between the gaps on different sheets of the Fermi surface, increases when we depart either way from the optimal doping. Although our measurements do not go into the far overdoped regime, these results are consistent with the measurements of the specific-heat jump[33] and the residual density of states.[34] as well as with measurements of thermal conductivity,[35, 36] In particular, thermal-conductivity measurements with heat flow along the c-axis actually suggest that nodal regions develop in the superconducting gap in heavily underdoped and overdoped compositions. This, in turn, is consistent with measurements of \lambda_{c} in a closely related Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ni_{x})_{2}As_{2}, where c-axis nodes were suggested.[37]

## IV Conclusion

In conclusion, the zero-temperature value of the in-plane London penetration depth, \lambda_{ab}(0), has been measured for the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} series across the superconducting "dome" of the phase diagram using an Al coating technique along with TDR measurements. There is a clear increase in \lambda_{ab}(0) below x\approx 0.047, which is consistent with a reduction in the superfluid density due to the competition between itinerant antiferromagnetism and superconductivity for the same electrons. The measured values of \lambda_{ab}(0) were used to construct the normalized superfluid density (phase stiffness), \rho_{s}(T), and study its evolution with doping. The upward concavity of \rho_{s}(T) just below T_{c} for samples across the superconducting dome of the phase diagram implies the importance of two-gap effects for all doping levels. A notable suppression of \rho_{s} for heavily underdoped and some suppression for slightly overdoped samples with respect to samples with optimal doping suggests a developing anisotropy of the superconducting gap toward the edges of the superconducting dome, consistent with the behavior found in specific-heat and thermal-conductivity studies.
