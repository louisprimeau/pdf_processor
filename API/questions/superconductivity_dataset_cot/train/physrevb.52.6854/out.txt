###### Abstract

The superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) of HgBa2CuO4+-8 (Hg 1:2:0:1) has been determined under pressures up to 1.7 GPa over a wide d range. We found that the linear pressure effect on T_{c} (_dT_c/_dP_) is constant at +2.0 +- 0.1 K/GPa for d < 0.3, but displays a drastic change around d ~ 0.3, coinciding with the onset of a quadratic pressure effect on T_{c} and the "boomerang path" previously reported. Comparison of the present observations for d < 0.3 with the inverse parabolic carrier density (_n_) dependence of T_{c} suggests that the inverse parabolic T_{c}(n) relation is less universal than originally envisioned, and that the observed large dT_{c}/dP of optimally doped Hg 1:2:0:1 and other members of the homologous series is a result of the change of electron bands induced by pressure.

## I Introduction

In an attempt to understand the occurrence of superconductivity in high-temperature superconductors (HTSs), many experiments have been carried out to find possible correlations between the superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) and some physical parameters. One of these correlations is the so-called universal inverse parabolic dependence of T_{c} on the number of carriers per CuO2(_n_) in HTS, i.e., T_{c}(n) = T_{c}^{\max}\{1 - a\ (n - n_{\rm op})^{2}\} with a = 82.6 and n_{\rm op} = 0.16, observed for a wide variety of HTS compounds.1 According to this T_{c}-_n_ correlation, superconductivity occurs mainly in the CuO2 sheets over a limited region of n between (0.16 - 1/\sqrt{a}) and (0.16 + 1/\sqrt{a}). T_{c} peaks at T_{c}^{\max} when the compound is optimally doped with n = n_{\rm op} = 0.16. The HTS is known as underdoped when n < n_{\rm op}, and overdoped when n > n_{\rm op}. Several phenomenological models2-4 have subsequently been advanced to account for the observed pressure effect on T_{c}(dT_{c}/dP) based on the above universal T_{c}-_n_ rather successfully. dT_{c}/dP has therefore been attributed to two sources: the pressure-induced charge transfer (_dn/dP_) and the _n_-independent pressure-induced constant shift in T_{c}^{\max} (dT_{c}^{\max}/dP). However, most of the reported high-pressure experiments have been restricted to the optimally doped samples. This is particularly true for HgBa2Ca_{m - 1}Cu_{m}O_{2m + 2 + 8} with m = 1, 2, and 3.5,6 Unusually high T_{c} has been achieved under pressure.6,7 and universal T_{c}(P)-behavior was observed for the compounds with different _m_'s.5,6 Although several studies were made on La2-_x_A_xCuO4 (La 2:1:4) with A = {\rm Sr} and Ba,6 Tl2Ba2CuO6+-8 (Tl 2:2:0:1),2,9 and Ca/La doped YBa2Cu3O7-8 (Y 1:2:3)3,4 over a relatively wide T_{c} variation, the T_{c} range was achieved either through combined anion- and cation doping for La 2:1:4 and Y 1:2:3 or only in the overdoped region for Tl 2:2:0:1. Cation doping is known to induce local strain10 that may complicate the interpretation of the results. Adding to the complication are the structural instabilities at temperatures above T_{c} associated with the La 2:1:4 compound system8 and the effect associated with the linear CuO chain in the Y 1:2:3 compounds.3 The newly discovered HTS compound HgBa2CuO4+-8 (Hg 1:2:0:1) has been found11 to display a wide cation-doping range by varying d, covering almost the whole superconducting region. Its T_{c} can be varied from below 1 K through a T_{c}^{\max} = 97 K and finally T \sim 20 K as d increases continuously, representing the largest T_{c} variation ever achieved by only a single ion doping. We have therefore systematically investigated the dT_{c}/dP of Hg 1:2:0:1 with different doping to test the universality of the T_{c}(n)-correlation proposed. In this paper, we report results of the dT_{c}/dP of the T_{c} of single-phase samples of Hg 1:2:0:1 with 0.07 <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d < d above 500 degC in vacuum resulted in a partial decomposition of the compound. In this work, 6 was determined based on the T_{c}(d)-curve recently reported [11] after the T_{c} was measured.

The structure and the phase purity were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD). The T_{c} at ambient was measured both resistively by the four-lead method using a Linear Research LR-400 bridge and magnetically using a Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer. Under pressure, the T_{c} was determined resistively and, for a few samples, by the ac magnetic susceptibility technique. The high-pressure environment was generated inside a Teflon cup in a Be-Cu high-pressure clamp, [14] using 3M fluorinert as the pressure medium. The pressure was measured with a superconducting Pb manometer which was situated next to the sample inside the Teflon cup and the temperature by a chromel-alumel thermocouple above 30 K and a Ge-thermometer below 30 K.

## III Results and Discussion

The 11 samples studied here are single-phase Hg 1:2:0:1 without any impurities within the resolution of our XRD analysis of \sim\pm4%. The superconducting transition width (\Delta T_{c}) of these samples ranges from \sim1 to 6 K (the narrowest for the optimally doped sample), and the resistively and magnetically determined mid-point T_{c}'s of the samples (to be defined below) differ not more than 2 K, suggesting a relatively high quality for these samples. The doping level deduced from T_{c} is shown in Fig. 1 for the used samples. The value of d was estimated based on the published T_{c}(d) relation, [11] which shows that T_{c} varies with d parabolically and exhibits a T_{c}^{\max} of 97 K at the optimal d_{\rm op}=0.22. Among the 11 samples examined, three were underdoped with a minimum T_{c}=45 K and seven were overdoped with a minimum T_{c}=26 K, in addition to the optimally doped one.

Two typical sets of resistivity curves \rho(T) are presented in Figs. 2 and 3 representing two samples under different pressures: one optimally doped and the other extremely overdoped, where the onset (T_{CO}), mid-point (T_{c}), and offset (T_{cf}) of the T_{c}'s are defined. For the optimally doped (and also the underdoped) sample, the T_{c} is shifted upward linearly by pressure, and \Delta T_{c} is also increased from \sim1 to 3 K as the pressure increases from 0 to 1.5 GPa. However, for the extremely overdoped sample with d\geq0.3, the T_{c} is shifted nonmonotonically by pressure, but the transition width remains the same (Fig. 3). The T_{c} of three samples under pressure, two of them underdoped and one extremely overdoped, was measured magnetically. The dT_{c}/dP in one of the samples with d=0.12 was verified by simultaneously measuring the T_{c} magnetically and resistively. No difference in the T_{c}(P)-T_{c}(0) was noted within our experimental resolution. The T_{c} of the 11 samples under various pressures are summarized in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), where Fig. 4(a) shows the underdoped (Nos. 1-3) and the optimally doped (Nos. 4) samples and Fig. 4(b) shows the overdoped ones (Nos. 5-11). The numbers in the figures represent the sequential order of increasing O content (d) in the samples.

  They are, respectively, 0.07, 0.12, 0.19, 0.22, 0.27, 0.30, 0.31, 0.34, 0.36, 0.37, and 0.39.

According to the universal inverse quadratic relation T_{c}(n) = T_{c}^{\max }[1 - a(n - n_{\rm op})^{2}\rbrack, one obtains

\[dT_{c}/dP = [1 - a(n - n_{\rm op})^{2}\rbrack(dT_{c}^{\max }/dP)\] (1) \[- T_{c}^{\max }(n - n_{\rm op})^{2}(da/dP)\] \[- 2aT_{c}^{\max }(n - n_{\rm op})(dn/dP)\] \[+ 2aT_{c}^{\max }(n - n_{\rm op})(dn_{\rm op}/dP)\ .\]

Therefore, dT_{c}/dP = dT_{c}^{\max }/dP for n = n_{\rm op}, which can be nonzero for reasons unknown. The pressure effects for samples with n \neq n_{\rm op} enable us to examine the relationship between some parameters in Eq. (1). Especially,

\[d(dT_{c}/dP)/dn = 2(n - n_{\rm op})[ - a(dT_{c}^{\max }/dP)\] \[- T_{c}^{\max }(da/dP)]\] \[- 2aT_{c}^{\max }[(dn/dP) - (dn_{\rm op}/dP)]\ .\]

(dT_{c}^{\max }/dP) represents the change in T_{c}^{\max }(da/dP) the change in the range for HTS to occur, (dn/dP) the charge transfer, and (dn_{\rm op}/dP) the change in the optimal doping, all induced by pressure. The original phenomenological model [2] follows by retaining only the pressure-induced charge-transfer term on the basis of a rigid band model, i.e., dT_{c}/dP = - 2aT_{c}^{\max }(n - n_{\rm op})(dn/dP). This model predicts a linear n-dependent (dT_{c}/dP), which is positive for samples in the underdoped region (i.e., n < n_{\rm op}), negative in the overdoped region (i.e., n > n_{\rm op}), and zero for the optimally doped sample (i.e., n = n_{\rm op}). A modified model [4] was advanced by retaining the (dn/dP) and part of the (dT_{c}^{\max }/dP) terms, i.e., dT_{c}/dP = (dT_{c}^{\max }/dP) - 2aT_{c}^{\max }(n - n_{\rm op})(dn/dP). This model accounts for the nonzero dT_{c}/dP for the optimally doped Y 1:2:3 in addition to the linear n-dependent dT_{c}/dP in the original phenomenological model. [2] Unfortunately, neither of the above models can explain the \delta or n dependence of dT_{c}/dP of Hg 1:2:0:1 observed here.

For the Hg 1:2:0:1 compound system, T_{c} depends on 8 inverse parabolically as T_{c} = 97[1 - 26(\delta - \delta_{\rm op})^{2}\rbrack with \delta_{\rm op} = 0.22 over the whole \delta range investigated. [1] However, T_{c} was found [11] to vary with n inverse parabolically as T_{c} = 97[1 - 50(n - n_{\rm op})^{2}\rbrack only for n < 0.2 which corresponds to \delta < 0.3, where n was determined by thermopower measurements. For \delta < 0.3, n is proportional to 8 but each O atom contributes only 0.72 holes to each Cu instead of 2, as predicted by the ionic model, due to strong covalent bonding between O and Hg in the HgO_{6} layer of the compound. [11, 15] A "boomerang path" appears in T_{c}(n) together with a violation of the scaling between \delta and n for n > 0.2 (\delta > 0.3). The drastic change in the scaling and the deviation of the inverse parabolic T_{c}(n) relation near \delta \sim 0.3 have been ascribed to the possible change in the O sites for \delta > 0.3, the defect scattering or the contribution of HgO layer to S(290 K). [11] Therefore, the n deduced form of the thermopower should be taken with caution for \delta > 0.3, and we will use \delta to represent the doping level in the following discussion.

The dT_{c}/dP of Hg 1:2:0:1 is analyzed in terms of a fit of T_{c}(P) = T_{c}(0) + \alpha P + \beta P^{2}. The \delta dependences of the linear pressure term \alpha and the quadratic pressure term \beta are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. A drastic change in both \alpha and \beta near \delta \sim 0.3 is evident, i.e., \alpha is a constant of 2.0\pm 0.2 K/GPa for \delta \leq 0.25, decreases rapidly to 0 near \delta = 0.3, and returns to 1.0\pm 0.2 K/GPa at \delta \sim 0.33 before it falls off again for \delta > 0.33 and \beta is 0\pm 0.02 K/GPa [2] for \delta \leq 0.30, starts to drop rapidly near 0.31, and decreases to \sim - 1.7\pm 0.5 K/GPa [2] at \delta = 0.33 before it rises again for greater \delta.

In the discussion that follows, we shall first discuss the dT_{c}/dP of Hg 1:2:0:1 samples with \delta < 0.3 assuming that the inverse parabolic T_{c}(n) relation is valid at both ambient and high pressure. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, dT_{c}/dP is independent of both n and \delta for Hg 1:2:0:1

Figure 4: Mid-point T_{c}(P) of samples with different \delta’s: (a)—underdoped and optimally doped, with \delta = 0.22, 0.19, 0.12, and 0.07 from top to bottom; (b)—overdoped with \delta = 0.27, 0.30, 0.31, 0.34, 0.36, 0.37, and 0.39 from top to bottom.

  with \delta\!\leq\!0.25 which spans the underdoped and slightly overdoped regions. For n\!=\!n_{\rm op} and d\!\ (dT_{e}/dP)/dn\!=\!0, Eq. (2) gives (dn/dP)\!\!=\!(dn_{\rm op}/dP). This shows that the optimal concentration n_{\rm op} should shift with pressure if the pressure induces a non-negligible charge transfer. Similar result has been suggested before.[16] In such a case, the observed large T_{e} enhancement for the optimal-by doped Hg 1:2:0:1 [4] is a very natural result. The pressure-induced shift in n_{\rm op} implies that the electronic bands of Hg 1:2:0:1 and other members of the Hg-12(m-1)m (and possibly other cuprate HTS's) are not rigid, so the inverse parabolic T_{e}-n or -\delta relation would vary accordingly. Even the inverse parabolic relation itself may only be valid under a set of more restrictive conditions than were originally envisioned.

The sudden appearance of nonzero \beta values for Hg 1:2:0:1 with \delta\!\geq\!0.3 (or n\!>\!0.22) under pressure below 1.5 GPa as shown in Fig. 6 coincides with the onset of the "boomerang path" in T_{e}(n) previously observed[11]\rm Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} is a similarly overdoped compound. However, its T_{e} varies parabolically with n determined from the thermopower measurements without the boomerang behavior and displays only the linear pressure effect. We therefore propose that the drastic change of dT_{e}/dP near \delta\!\sim\!0.3 as shown in Figs. 5 and 6 may be associated with the scattering effect due to the presence of extra O sites in heavily overdoped Hg 1:2:0:1 as previously suggested.[11] Details of the process are currently under study.

## IV Conclusion

We have determined systematically the dT_{e}/dP for Hg 1:2:0:1 with 0.07\!\leq\!\delta\!\leq\!0.39. Both the linear and quadratic effects on T_{e}, i.e., \alpha and \beta in T_{e}(P) = T_{e}(0)\!+\!\alpha P\!+\!\beta P^{2}, were observed. \alpha was found to be positive and almost constant at +2.0\!\pm\!0.2 K/GPa for \delta up to 0.24 and drops drastically to \sim\!0 K/GPa at \delta\!=\!0.3 and returns to 1.0\!\pm\!0.2 K/GPa before it falls off slowly, while \beta is 0 for \delta\!<\!0.3, and drops to -1.5 K/GPa[2] at \sim\!0.34 before it increases again. The results for \delta\!<\!0.3 were compared with predictions of the inverse parabolic T_{e}(n) relation and previous phenomenological models on T_{e}(P). We conclude that the inverse parabolic T_{e}(n) relation and its universal parameters are valid only under conditions more restrictive than originally envisioned and that the unusually large dT_{e}/dP observed in optimally doped Hg 1:2:0:1 and other homologous members of the series Hg-12(m-1)m can be understood in terms of a pressure-induced shift in n_{\rm op}, the doping level for maximum T_{e}. The drastic change in dT_{e}/dP with \delta\!>\!0.3 is attributed to the possible scattering effect associated with the oxygen in the heavily overdoped samples, where the boomerang path occurs in T_{e}(n). Detailed process responsible for the observation remains unknown.

###### Abstract

The superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) of HgBa2CuO4+-8 (Hg 1:2:0:1) has been determined under pressures up to 1.7 GPa over a wide d range. We found that the linear pressure effect on T_{c} (_dT_c/_dP_) is constant at +2.0 +- 0.1 K/GPa for d < 0.3, but displays a drastic change around d ~ 0.3, coinciding with the onset of a quadratic pressure effect on T_{c} and the "boomerang path" previously reported. Comparison of the present observations for d < 0.3 with the inverse parabolic carrier density (_n_) dependence of T_{c} suggests that the inverse parabolic T_{c}(n) relation is less universal than originally envisioned, and that the observed large dT_{c}/dP of optimally doped Hg 1:2:0:1 and other members of the homologous series is a result of the change of electron bands induced by pressure.

T_{c} peaks at T_{c}^{\max} when the compound is optimally doped with n = n_{\rm op} = 0.16. The HTS is known as underdoped when n < n_{\rm op}, and overdoped when n > n_{\rm op}.

However, most of the reported high-pressure experiments have been restricted to the optimally doped samples. This is particularly true for HgBa2Ca_{m - 1}Cu_{m}O_{2m + 2 + 8} with m = 1, 2, and 3.5,6 Unusually high T_{c} has been achieved under pressure.6,7 and universal T_{c}(P)-behavior was observed for the compounds with different _m_'s.5,6 Although several studies were made on La2-_x_A_xCuO4 (La 2:1:4) with A = {\rm Sr} and Ba,6 Tl2Ba2CuO6+-8 (Tl 2:2:0:1),2,9 and Ca/La doped YBa2Cu3O7-8 (Y 1:2:3)3,4 over a relatively wide T_{c} variation, the T_{c} range was achieved either through combined anion- and cation doping for La 2:1:4 and Y 1:2:3 or only in the overdoped region for Tl 2:2:0:1. Cation doping is known to induce local strain10 that may complicate the interpretation of the results. Adding to the complication are the structural instabilities at temperatures above T_{c} associated with the La 2:1:4 compound system8 and the effect associated with the linear CuO chain in the Y 1:2:3 compounds.3 The newly discovered HTS compound HgBa2CuO4+-8 (Hg 1:2:0:1) has been found11 to display a wide cation-doping range by varying d, covering almost the whole superconducting region.

In this paper, we report results of the dT_{c}/dP of the T_{c} of single-phase samples of Hg 1:2:0:1 with 0.07 <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d <= d < d above 500 degC in vacuum resulted in a partial decomposition of the compound. In this work, 6 was determined based on the T_{c}(d)-curve recently reported [11] after the T_{c} was measured.

The structure and the phase purity were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD). The T_{c} at ambient was measured both resistively by the four-lead method using a Linear Research LR-400 bridge and magnetically using a Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer.

The pressure was measured with a superconducting Pb manometer which was situated next to the sample inside the Teflon cup and the temperature by a chromel-alumel thermocouple above 30 K and a Ge-thermometer below 30 K.

## III Results and Discussion

The 11 samples studied here are single-phase Hg 1:2:0:1 without any impurities within the resolution of our XRD analysis of \sim\pm4%. The superconducting transition width (\Delta T_{c}) of these samples ranges from \sim1 to 6 K (the narrowest for the optimally doped sample), and the resistively and magnetically determined mid-point T_{c}'s of the samples (to be defined below) differ not more than 2 K, suggesting a relatively high quality for these samples. The doping level deduced from T_{c} is shown in Fig. 1 for the used samples. The value of d was estimated based on the published T_{c}(d) relation, [11] which shows that T_{c} varies with d parabolically and exhibits a T_{c}^{\max} of 97 K at the optimal d_{\rm op}=0.22. Among the 11 samples examined, three were underdoped with a minimum T_{c}=45 K and seven were overdoped with a minimum T_{c}=26 K, in addition to the optimally doped one.

Two typical sets of resistivity curves \rho(T) are presented in Figs. 2 and 3 representing two samples under different pressures: one optimally doped and the other extremely overdoped, where the onset (T_{CO}), mid-point (T_{c}), and offset (T_{cf}) of the T_{c}'s are defined. For the optimally doped (and also the underdoped) sample, the T_{c} is shifted upward linearly by pressure, and \Delta T_{c} is also increased from \sim1 to 3 K as the pressure increases from 0 to 1.5 GPa. However, for the extremely overdoped sample with d\geq0.3, the T_{c} is shifted nonmonotonically by pressure, but the transition width remains the same (Fig. 3). The T_{c} of three samples under pressure, two of them underdoped and one extremely overdoped, was measured magnetically. The dT_{c}/dP in one of the samples with d=0.12 was verified by simultaneously measuring the T_{c} magnetically and resistively. No difference in the T_{c}(P)-T_{c}(0) was noted within our experimental resolution. The T_{c} of the 11 samples under various pressures are summarized in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), where Fig. 4(a) shows the underdoped (Nos. 1-3) and the optimally doped (Nos. 4) samples and Fig. 4(b) shows the overdoped ones (Nos. 5-11). The numbers in the figures represent the sequential order of increasing O content (d) in the samples.

  They are, respectively, 0.07, 0.12, 0.19, 0.22, 0.27, 0.30, 0.31, 0.34, 0.36, 0.37, and 0.39.

According to the universal inverse quadratic relation T_{c}(n) = T_{c}^{\max }[1 - a(n - n_{\rm op})^{2}\rbrack, one obtains

\[dT_{c}/dP = [1 - a(n - n_{\rm op})^{2}\rbrack(dT_{c}^{\max }/dP)\] (1) \[- T_{c}^{\max }(n - n_{\rm op})^{2}(da/dP)\] \[- 2aT_{c}^{\max }(n - n_{\rm op})(dn/dP)\] \[+ 2aT_{c}^{\max }(n - n_{\rm op})(dn_{\rm op}/dP)\ .\]

Therefore, dT_{c}/dP = dT_{c}^{\max }/dP for n = n_{\rm op}, which can be nonzero for reasons unknown. The pressure effects for samples with n \neq n_{\rm op} enable us to examine the relationship between some parameters in Eq. (1). Especially,

\[d(dT_{c}/dP)/dn = 2(n - n_{\rm op})[ - a(dT_{c}^{\max }/dP)\] \[- T_{c}^{\max }(da/dP)]\] \[- 2aT_{c}^{\max }[(dn/dP) - (dn_{\rm op}/dP)]\ .\]

(dT_{c}^{\max }/dP) represents the change in T_{c}^{\max }(da/dP) the change in the range for HTS to occur, (dn/dP) the charge transfer, and (dn_{\rm op}/dP) the change in the optimal doping, all induced by pressure. The original phenomenological model [2] follows by retaining only the pressure-induced charge-transfer term on the basis of a rigid band model, i.e., dT_{c}/dP = - 2aT_{c}^{\max }(n - n_{\rm op})(dn/dP). This model predicts a linear n-dependent (dT_{c}/dP), which is positive for samples in the underdoped region (i.e., n < n_{\rm op}), negative in the overdoped region (i.e., n > n_{\rm op}), and zero for the optimally doped sample (i.e., n = n_{\rm op}). A modified model [4] was advanced by retaining the (dn/dP) and part of the (dT_{c}^{\max }/dP) terms, i.e., dT_{c}/dP = (dT_{c}^{\max }/dP) - 2aT_{c}^{\max }(n - n_{\rm op})(dn/dP). This model accounts for the nonzero dT_{c}/dP for the optimally doped Y 1:2:3 in addition to the linear n-dependent dT_{c}/dP in the original phenomenological model. [2] Unfortunately, neither of the above models can explain the \delta or n dependence of dT_{c}/dP of Hg 1:2:0:1 observed here.

For the Hg 1:2:0:1 compound system, T_{c} depends on 8 inverse parabolically as T_{c} = 97[1 - 26(\delta - \delta_{\rm op})^{2}\rbrack with \delta_{\rm op} = 0.22 over the whole \delta range investigated. [1] However, T_{c} was found [11] to vary with n inverse parabolically as T_{c} = 97[1 - 50(n - n_{\rm op})^{2}\rbrack only for n < 0.2 which corresponds to \delta < 0.3, where n was determined by thermopower measurements. For \delta < 0.3, n is proportional to 8 but each O atom contributes only 0.72 holes to each Cu instead of 2, as predicted by the ionic model, due to strong covalent bonding between O and Hg in the HgO_{6} layer of the compound. [11, 15] A "boomerang path" appears in T_{c}(n) together with a violation of the scaling between \delta and n for n > 0.2 (\delta > 0.3). The drastic change in the scaling and the deviation of the inverse parabolic T_{c}(n) relation near \delta \sim 0.3 have been ascribed to the possible change in the O sites for \delta > 0.3, the defect scattering or the contribution of HgO layer to S(290 K). [11] Therefore, the n deduced form of the thermopower should be taken with caution for \delta > 0.3, and we will use \delta to represent the doping level in the following discussion.

The dT_{c}/dP of Hg 1:2:0:1 is analyzed in terms of a fit of T_{c}(P) = T_{c}(0) + \alpha P + \beta P^{2}. The \delta dependences of the linear pressure term \alpha and the quadratic pressure term \beta are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. A drastic change in both \alpha and \beta near \delta \sim 0.3 is evident, i.e., \alpha is a constant of 2.0\pm 0.2 K/GPa for \delta \leq 0.25, decreases rapidly to 0 near \delta = 0.3, and returns to 1.0\pm 0.2 K/GPa at \delta \sim 0.33 before it falls off again for \delta > 0.33 and \beta is 0\pm 0.02 K/GPa [2] for \delta \leq 0.30, starts to drop rapidly near 0.31, and decreases to \sim - 1.7\pm 0.5 K/GPa [2] at \delta = 0.33 before it rises again for greater \delta.

In the discussion that follows, we shall first discuss the dT_{c}/dP of Hg 1:2:0:1 samples with \delta < 0.3 assuming that the inverse parabolic T_{c}(n) relation is valid at both ambient and high pressure. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, dT_{c}/dP is independent of both n and \delta for Hg 1:2:0:1

Figure 4: Mid-point T_{c}(P) of samples with different \delta’s: (a)—underdoped and optimally doped, with \delta = 0.22, 0.19, 0.12, and 0.07 from top to bottom; (b)—overdoped with \delta = 0.27, 0.30, 0.31, 0.34, 0.36, 0.37, and 0.39 from top to bottom.

  with \delta\!\leq\!0.25 which spans the underdoped and slightly overdoped regions. For n\!=\!n_{\rm op} and d\!\ (dT_{e}/dP)/dn\!=\!0, Eq. (2) gives (dn/dP)\!\!=\!(dn_{\rm op}/dP). This shows that the optimal concentration n_{\rm op} should shift with pressure if the pressure induces a non-negligible charge transfer. Similar result has been suggested before.[16] In such a case, the observed large T_{e} enhancement for the optimal-by doped Hg 1:2:0:1 [4] is a very natural result. The pressure-induced shift in n_{\rm op} implies that the electronic bands of Hg 1:2:0:1 and other members of the Hg-12(m-1)m (and possibly other cuprate HTS's) are not rigid, so the inverse parabolic T_{e}-n or -\delta relation would vary accordingly. Even the inverse parabolic relation itself may only be valid under a set of more restrictive conditions than were originally envisioned.

The sudden appearance of nonzero \beta values for Hg 1:2:0:1 with \delta\!\geq\!0.3 (or n\!>\!0.22) under pressure below 1.5 GPa as shown in Fig. 6 coincides with the onset of the "boomerang path" in T_{e}(n) previously observed[11]\rm Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} is a similarly overdoped compound. However, its T_{e} varies parabolically with n determined from the thermopower measurements without the boomerang behavior and displays only the linear pressure effect. We therefore propose that the drastic change of dT_{e}/dP near \delta\!\sim\!0.3 as shown in Figs. 5 and 6 may be associated with the scattering effect due to the presence of extra O sites in heavily overdoped Hg 1:2:0:1 as previously suggested.[11] Details of the process are currently under study.

## IV Conclusion

We have determined systematically the dT_{e}/dP for Hg 1:2:0:1 with 0.07\!\leq\!\delta\!\leq\!0.39. Both the linear and quadratic effects on T_{e}, i.e., \alpha and \beta in T_{e}(P) = T_{e}(0)\!+\!\alpha P\!+\!\beta P^{2}, were observed. \alpha was found to be positive and almost constant at +2.0\!\pm\!0.2 K/GPa for \delta up to 0.24 and drops drastically to \sim\!0 K/GPa at \delta\!=\!0.3 and returns to 1.0\!\pm\!0.2 K/GPa before it falls off slowly, while \beta is 0 for \delta\!<\!0.3, and drops to -1.5 K/GPa[2] at \sim\!0.34 before it increases again. The results for \delta\!<\!0.3 were compared with predictions of the inverse parabolic T_{e}(n) relation and previous phenomenological models on T_{e}(P). We conclude that the inverse parabolic T_{e}(n) relation and its universal parameters are valid only under conditions more restrictive than originally envisioned and that the unusually large dT_{e}/dP observed in optimally doped Hg 1:2:0:1 and other homologous members of the series Hg-12(m-1)m can be understood in terms of a pressure-induced shift in n_{\rm op}, the doping level for maximum T_{e}. The drastic change in dT_{e}/dP with \delta\!>\!0.3 is attributed to the possible scattering effect associated with the oxygen in the heavily overdoped samples, where the boomerang path occurs in T_{e}(n). Detailed process responsible for the observation remains unknown.
