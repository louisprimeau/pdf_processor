22 September 20052224509 2245 piston cylinder clamp especially designed for magnetization measurements under pressure.[16] The sample was mixed with Fluorient FC77 (pressure transmitting medium) with a sample-to-liquid volume ratio of approximately 1/6. The pressure dependence of T_{c} was taken from a separate set of magnetization experiments where a small piece of indium [_T__c_(_p_=0) = 3.4 K] with known T_{c}(_p_) dependence was added to the sample and both _T__c_'s of indium and ZrB12 were recorded. The field-cooled (FC) magnetization measurements were performed with a SQUID magnetometer in a field of 0.5 mT at temperatures between 1.75 K and 10 K. The absence of weak links between grains was confirmed by the linear magnetic field dependence of the FC magnetization, measured at 0.25 mT, 0.5 mT, and 1.0 mT for the highest and the lowest pressures at _T_=1.75 K.

## III Experimental results and discussion

Figure 1 shows the pressure dependence of the transition temperature T_{c} of ZrB12 obtained from magnetization measurements. T_{c} was taken from the linearly extrapolated _M_(_T_) curves in the vicinity of T_{c} with M = 0 line (see inset in Fig. 1). The linear fit yields _dT__c_/_dp_ = -0.0225(3) K/kbar. Note that this value is in good agreement with _dT__c_/_dp_ = -0.024 K/kbar obtained indirectly by Lortz _et al._[4] from thermal expansion measurements.

The logarithmic volume derivative of T_{c} in the case of a strong coupled BCS superconductor can be described by the following equation:[17]

\[\frac{d\ln T_{c}}{d\ln V} = - B\frac{d\ln T_{c}}{dp} = (2A - 1)\gamma + A\frac{d\ln\eta}{d\ln V},\]

where A = 1.04\lambda_{\text{el-ph}}(1 + 0.38\mu^{\ast})\lbrack\lambda_{\text{el-ph}} - \mu^{\ast}(1 + 0.62\lambda_{\text{el-ph}})\rbrack^{ - 2} is a function of the electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{\text{el-ph}} and the Coulomb pseudopotential \mu^{\ast},[17]B denotes the bulk modulus, \gamma = - d\ln(\omega)/d\ln V is the Gruneisen parameter, \left\langle \omega \right\rangle is an average phonon frequency, \eta \equiv N(E_{f})\left\langle I^{2} \right\rangle is the Hopfeld parameter.[19]N(E_{f}) is the density of states at the Fermi level, and \left\langle I^{2} \right\rangle is the average squared electronic matrix element. Let us now apply Eq. (1) to an analysis of _dT__c_/_dp_ data for ZrB12 superconductor. One should note, however, that not all the quantities needed for such analysis have been measured for ZrB12. Thus we must account for "typical" values or values measured in similar compounds. The Hopfeld parameter \eta generally increases under pressure with d ln \eta/d\ln V = - 1 for _s_-, and _p_-metal superconductors[18] and - 3 to - 4 for transition-metal (_d_-electron) superconductors.[19] Since the band structure of zirconium dodecaboride near E_{f} (Ref. [20]) as well as the pressure effect on T_{c} look like those of a simple metal, for the Hopfeld parameter we choose d ln \eta/d\ln V = - 1. In all conventional superconductors with low critical temperatures the values of \mu^{\ast} range from 0.1 to 0.15 with most concentrated around 0.1 (see, e.g., Ref. [7]). Assuming now \mu^{\ast} = 0.1, and taking \lambda_{\text{el-ph}} = 0.67 (Ref. [3]) and B = 2490 kbar in analogy with UB12,[21] for the Gruneisen parameter we get the value \gamma \approx 2.83. This value is in reasonable agreement with \gamma = 3.3 obtained at a temperature slightly above T_{c} by Lortz _et al._[4] based on thermal expansion measurements. Such an agreement also indicates that the chosen values for the volume derivative of the Hopfeld parameter and the chemical potential are reliable.

PE on the electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{\text{el-ph}} can be determined by using the well-known McMillan equation,[22]

\[\lambda_{\text{el-ph}} \propto \frac{N(E_{f})\left\langle I^{2} \right\rangle}{\left\langle a^{2} \right\rangle},\]

which leads to

\[\frac{d\ln\lambda_{\text{el-ph}}}{dp} = - \frac{1}{B}\frac{d\ln\eta}{d\ln V} - \frac{2\gamma}{B}.\]

Substitution of \gamma = 2.83 and d\ln\eta/d\ln V = - 1 gives d\ln\lambda_{\text{el-ph}}/dp = - 0.19 %/kbar. A slightly larger value d\ln\lambda_{\text{el-ph}}/dp = - 0.22 %/kbar is obtained with \gamma = 3.3 from Ref. [4].

As a next step we studied the pressure effect on the magnetic field penetration depth \lambda. The temperature dependence of \lambda was calculated from the measured FC magnetization by using the Shoenberg formula,[23] modified for the known grain size distribution N(R),[24]

\[\chi = - \frac{3}{2}{\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(1 - \frac{3\lambda}{R}\coth\frac{R}{\lambda} + \frac{3\lambda^{2}}{R^{2}} \right)}g(R)dR\left/ {\int_{0}^{\infty}g(R)dR} \right.\]

where \chi = M/HV is the volume susceptibility, V is the volume of the sample, R is the grain radius, and _g_(_R_) is the analytical function describing the N(R)R^{3} dependence (see inset in Fig. 2). The resulting temperature dependence \lambda^{ - 2}(T) at ambient pressure is shown in Fig. 2. The reconstructed data were fitted with the empirical power-law \lambda^{ - 2}(T)/\lambda^{ - 2}(0) = 1 - (TT/_{c})[25]. The fit yields \lambda^{ - 2}(0) = 48.4(2)\mum^{ - 2}, T_{c} = 6.078(5) K, and n = 3.65(4). Note that the value of the power exponent n is close to "4", which corresponds to a strong-coupled BCS superconductor.[26]

  In order to obtain the value of the superconducting gap \Delta, the data have also been analyzed by means of the BCS model. For clean superconductor the temperature dependence of \lambda^{-2} can be described in the following way:[26]

\[\frac{\lambda^{-2}(T)}{\lambda^{-2}(0)}=1+2\int_{\Delta(T)}^{\infty}\frac{\partial F}{\partial E}\frac{E}{\langle\overline{E^{2}-\Delta(T)^{2}}\rangle}dE,\] (5)

where F=[1+exp(E/k_{B}T)]^{-1} is the Fermi function, \Delta(T) = \Delta_{0}.\overline{\Delta}(T/T_{c}) represents the temperature dependence of the energy gap, and \Delta_{0} is the zero temperature value of the superconducting gap. \overline{\Delta}(T/T_{c}) is the normalized gap taken from Ref. [27]. The best fit to the data using Eq. (5) gives T_{c}= 6.09(2) K, \lambda^{-2}(0)=47.4(2) nm, and \Delta_{0}= 1.251(9) meV. The ratio 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}= 4.77(4) is found, suggesting that ZrB_{12} is a strong coupled BCS superconductor. Note that a rather close value 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}= 4.8 has been obtained in point-contact spectroscopy[3] and tunnelling[6] experiments. On the other hand, a smaller value =3.7 has been reported by Lortz _et al.[4]_ using the heat-capacitance technique, thus suggesting a weak coupling strength. This difference has been already pointed out by Tsindlekht _et al.[6]_ It was explained by enhanced surface characteristics of the ZrB_{12} leading to rather different superconducting properties of bulk[4, 28, 6] and surface.[3, 6, 29, 30] Our measurements were performed in the Meissner state, with the field penetrating on a distance \lambda from the surface and, therefore, give a value of the superconducting gap consistent with those reported in the surface sensitive experiments.[3, 6] To estimate the uncertainty in the absolute value of \lambda(0) we used a procedure similar to that one described in Refs. [9] and [12]. The temperature dependence of \lambda(T) was calculated for N(R)+\langle\overline{N(R)}\rangle and N(R)-\langle\overline{N(R)}\rangle distributions. The fit of the resulting \lambda(T) curves with the power law as well as with the BCS model gives \lambda(0) in the range from 110 to 170 nm. Note that the values of the power exponent n (zero temperature superconducting gap \Delta_{0}) were found to be well within error bars for each series of \lambda(T) curves.

Figure 3(a) shows the pressure dependence of \lambda^{-2}(0) obtained by fitting the reconstructed \lambda(T) data at different pressures with the BCS model [Eq. (5)]. In these experiments we studied relative effects measured on the same sample in the same pressure cell. The main systematic error of these measurements comes from misalignments of the experimental setup occurring when the cell is removed from the SQUID magnetometer, to change the pressure, and put back again. This procedure was checked with a set of measurements at constant pressure. The systematic scattering of the magnetization data is about 0.3%, giving a relative error in \lambda^{-2}(T) of about 3%. The reducing of the grain size with pressure was taken into account in \lambda(T) calculation [Eq. (4)], by using the bulk modulus reported above. The linear fit yields \lambda^{-2}(0) =48.4(7)+0.29(11)p, implying that \lambda^{-2} increases under pressure with d\ln\lambda^{-2}(0)/dp= 0.60(23)% /kbar [see Fig. 3(a)].

To analyze the observed effect we used a procedure similar to the one described by Di Castro _et al.[10]_ There it was suggested that \lambda^{-2} increases under pressure because of two reasons, (i) band structure effects and (ii) renormalization of the electron-phonon coupling.[10] Under the assumption of ellipsoidal or cylindrical Fermi surface the first one can be obtained as[10]

\[\frac{d\ln\lambda^{-2}(0)}{dp}=\frac{1}{3B}-\frac{d\ln N(E_{f})}{dp}\simeq \frac{1}{3B}-\frac{1}{B}\frac{d\ln\eta}{d\ln V}.\] (6)

Here we used the fact that the pressure dependence of the electronic matrix element \langle I^{2}\rangle entering the Hopfeld parameter \eta can usually be neglected.[31] Hence, by setting d\ln\eta/d\ln V= -1, and B= 2490 kbar (see above) we obtain d\ln\lambda^{-2}(0)/dp= 0.05% /kbar.

Lines represent fits with the BCS model (dashed line), and with a power law (solid line). See text for an explanation. The inset shows the volume fraction distribution N(R)R^{3} of the ZrB_{12} powder determined from SEM photographs. The errors are statistical. The solid line represents the analytical g(R) function used in Eq. (4).

  The electron-phonon renormalized penetration depth reduces to \lambda^{*-2}(0)=\lambda^{-2}(0)/(1+\lambda_{\rm el-ph}),^{7} where \lambda(0) is the bare quantity we have considered before. We have then

\[\frac{d\ln\lambda^{*-2}(0)}{dp}=-\frac{\lambda_{\rm el-ph}}{1+\lambda_{\rm el- ph}}\frac{d\ln\lambda_{\rm el-ph}}{dp}.\] (7)

By substituting \lambda_{\rm el-ph}= 0.67 (Ref. [3]) and d\ln\lambda_{\rm el-ph}/dp\approx-0.2% /kbar obtained above we get d\ln\lambda^{*-2}(0)/dp\approx 0.08% /kbar.^{32} Thus the total pressure shift of \lambda^{-2}(0) expected assuming conventional (adiabatic) coupling of the charge carriers to the lattice in ZrB_{12} is of the order of 0.13% /kbar. This value is more than three times smaller than the experimentally observed one 0.60(23)% /kbar. This implies that in addition to band structure effects and renormalization of the electron-phonon coupling there are other effects responsible for the increasing of \lambda^{-2}(0) under pressure. Bearing in mind that \lambda measurements have been performed in a Meissner state, the observed dependence of \lambda on p can be explained suggesting that in ZrB_{12} close to the surface the coupling of the charge carriers to the lattice has a nonadiabatic character. Note that similar effects have been observed in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} that appears to be a highly nonadiabatic superconductor.^{12}

The results on the zero temperature superconducting gap \Delta_{0} are summarized in Fig. 3(b), where the ratio 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c} is plotted as a function of the pressure p. \Delta_{0} and T_{c} were obtained from the fit of \lambda^{-2}(T,p) data by using Eq. (5). The solid line represents a fit by the relation 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=const to the data. Bearing in mind that T_{c} scales linearly with pressure (see Fig. 1) the constant ratio can be understood in the frame of the BCS theory, which predicts 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=3.52. In the present study this ratio was found to be pressure independent within experimental errors, with mean value 4.79(1).

## IV Conclusions

In conclusion, we performed magnetization measurements in ZrB_{12} under hydrostatic pressure. A negative pressure effect on T_{c} with dT_{c}/dp= -0.0225(3) K/kbar is observed. The electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{\rm el-ph} decreases with pressure with d\ln\lambda_{\rm el-ph}/dp\approx-0.20% /kbar. The magnetic field penetration depth \lambda measured in the Meissner state is largely determined by the surface characteristics.^{33}\lambda was found to increase with pressure, with the pressure effect coefficient d\ln\lambda^{-2}(0)/dp=0.60(23)% /kbar. This coefficient is much larger than that one estimated theoretically within the adiabatic approximation. This can be explained suggesting that in ZrB_{12}, close to the surface, the coupling of the charge carriers to the lattice has a nonadiabatic character. The ratio 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=4.79(1) is found to be pressure independent and close to the strong coupling BCS value 4.8(1) reported in Refs. [3] and [6]. The value of \lambda extrapolated to zero temperature and at p=0 was estimated to be 140(30) nm.

That is why we consider the properties within the depth of 140 nm as superconducting surface ones.

22 September 20052224509 2245 piston cylinder clamp especially designed for magnetization measurements under pressure.[16] The sample was mixed with Fluorient FC77 (pressure transmitting medium) with a sample-to-liquid volume ratio of approximately 1/6. The pressure dependence of T_{c} was taken from a separate set of magnetization experiments where a small piece of indium [_T__c_(_p_=0) = 3.4 K] with known T_{c}(_p_) dependence was added to the sample and both _T__c_'s of indium and ZrB12 were recorded. The field-cooled (FC) magnetization measurements were performed with a SQUID magnetometer in a field of 0.5 mT at temperatures between 1.75 K and 10 K. The absence of weak links between grains was confirmed by the linear magnetic field dependence of the FC magnetization, measured at 0.25 mT, 0.5 mT, and 1.0 mT for the highest and the lowest pressures at _T_=1.75 K.

## III Experimental results and discussion

Figure 1 shows the pressure dependence of the transition temperature T_{c} of ZrB12 obtained from magnetization measurements. T_{c} was taken from the linearly extrapolated _M_(_T_) curves in the vicinity of T_{c} with M = 0 line (see inset in Fig. 1). The linear fit yields _dT__c_/_dp_ = -0.0225(3) K/kbar. Note that this value is in good agreement with _dT__c_/_dp_ = -0.024 K/kbar obtained indirectly by Lortz _et al._[4] from thermal expansion measurements.

The logarithmic volume derivative of T_{c} in the case of a strong coupled BCS superconductor can be described by the following equation:[17]

\[\frac{d\ln T_{c}}{d\ln V} = - B\frac{d\ln T_{c}}{dp} = (2A - 1)\gamma + A\frac{d\ln\eta}{d\ln V},\]

where A = 1.04\lambda_{\text{el-ph}}(1 + 0.38\mu^{\ast})\lbrack\lambda_{\text{el-ph}} - \mu^{\ast}(1 + 0.62\lambda_{\text{el-ph}})\rbrack^{ - 2} is a function of the electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{\text{el-ph}} and the Coulomb pseudopotential \mu^{\ast},[17]B denotes the bulk modulus, \gamma = - d\ln(\omega)/d\ln V is the Gruneisen parameter, \left\langle \omega \right\rangle is an average phonon frequency, \eta \equiv N(E_{f})\left\langle I^{2} \right\rangle is the Hopfeld parameter.[19]N(E_{f}) is the density of states at the Fermi level, and \left\langle I^{2} \right\rangle is the average squared electronic matrix element. Let us now apply Eq. (1) to an analysis of _dT__c_/_dp_ data for ZrB12 superconductor. One should note, however, that not all the quantities needed for such analysis have been measured for ZrB12. Thus we must account for "typical" values or values measured in similar compounds. The Hopfeld parameter \eta generally increases under pressure with d ln \eta/d\ln V = - 1 for _s_-, and _p_-metal superconductors[18] and - 3 to - 4 for transition-metal (_d_-electron) superconductors.[19] Since the band structure of zirconium dodecaboride near E_{f} (Ref. [20]) as well as the pressure effect on T_{c} look like those of a simple metal, for the Hopfeld parameter we choose d ln \eta/d\ln V = - 1. In all conventional superconductors with low critical temperatures the values of \mu^{\ast} range from 0.1 to 0.15 with most concentrated around 0.1 (see, e.g., Ref. [7]). Assuming now \mu^{\ast} = 0.1, and taking \lambda_{\text{el-ph}} = 0.67 (Ref. [3]) and B = 2490 kbar in analogy with UB12,[21] for the Gruneisen parameter we get the value \gamma \approx 2.83. This value is in reasonable agreement with \gamma = 3.3 obtained at a temperature slightly above T_{c} by Lortz _et al._[4] based on thermal expansion measurements. Such an agreement also indicates that the chosen values for the volume derivative of the Hopfeld parameter and the chemical potential are reliable.

PE on the electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{\text{el-ph}} can be determined by using the well-known McMillan equation,[22]

\[\lambda_{\text{el-ph}} \propto \frac{N(E_{f})\left\langle I^{2} \right\rangle}{\left\langle a^{2} \right\rangle},\]

which leads to

\[\frac{d\ln\lambda_{\text{el-ph}}}{dp} = - \frac{1}{B}\frac{d\ln\eta}{d\ln V} - \frac{2\gamma}{B}.\]

Substitution of \gamma = 2.83 and d\ln\eta/d\ln V = - 1 gives d\ln\lambda_{\text{el-ph}}/dp = - 0.19 %/kbar. A slightly larger value d\ln\lambda_{\text{el-ph}}/dp = - 0.22 %/kbar is obtained with \gamma = 3.3 from Ref. [4].

As a next step we studied the pressure effect on the magnetic field penetration depth \lambda. The temperature dependence of \lambda was calculated from the measured FC magnetization by using the Shoenberg formula,[23] modified for the known grain size distribution N(R),[24]

\[\chi = - \frac{3}{2}{\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(1 - \frac{3\lambda}{R}\coth\frac{R}{\lambda} + \frac{3\lambda^{2}}{R^{2}} \right)}g(R)dR\left/ {\int_{0}^{\infty}g(R)dR} \right.\]

where \chi = M/HV is the volume susceptibility, V is the volume of the sample, R is the grain radius, and _g_(_R_) is the analytical function describing the N(R)R^{3} dependence (see inset in Fig. 2). The resulting temperature dependence \lambda^{ - 2}(T) at ambient pressure is shown in Fig. 2. The reconstructed data were fitted with the empirical power-law \lambda^{ - 2}(T)/\lambda^{ - 2}(0) = 1 - (TT/_{c})[25]. The fit yields \lambda^{ - 2}(0) = 48.4(2)\mum^{ - 2}, T_{c} = 6.078(5) K, and n = 3.65(4). Note that the value of the power exponent n is close to "4", which corresponds to a strong-coupled BCS superconductor.[26]

  In order to obtain the value of the superconducting gap \Delta, the data have also been analyzed by means of the BCS model. For clean superconductor the temperature dependence of \lambda^{-2} can be described in the following way:[26]

\[\frac{\lambda^{-2}(T)}{\lambda^{-2}(0)}=1+2\int_{\Delta(T)}^{\infty}\frac{\partial F}{\partial E}\frac{E}{\langle\overline{E^{2}-\Delta(T)^{2}}\rangle}dE,\] (5)

where F=[1+exp(E/k_{B}T)]^{-1} is the Fermi function, \Delta(T) = \Delta_{0}.\overline{\Delta}(T/T_{c}) represents the temperature dependence of the energy gap, and \Delta_{0} is the zero temperature value of the superconducting gap. \overline{\Delta}(T/T_{c}) is the normalized gap taken from Ref. [27]. The best fit to the data using Eq. (5) gives T_{c}= 6.09(2) K, \lambda^{-2}(0)=47.4(2) nm, and \Delta_{0}= 1.251(9) meV. The ratio 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}= 4.77(4) is found, suggesting that ZrB_{12} is a strong coupled BCS superconductor. Note that a rather close value 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}= 4.8 has been obtained in point-contact spectroscopy[3] and tunnelling[6] experiments. On the other hand, a smaller value =3.7 has been reported by Lortz _et al.[4]_ using the heat-capacitance technique, thus suggesting a weak coupling strength. This difference has been already pointed out by Tsindlekht _et al.[6]_ It was explained by enhanced surface characteristics of the ZrB_{12} leading to rather different superconducting properties of bulk[4, 28, 6] and surface.[3, 6, 29, 30] Our measurements were performed in the Meissner state, with the field penetrating on a distance \lambda from the surface and, therefore, give a value of the superconducting gap consistent with those reported in the surface sensitive experiments.[3, 6] To estimate the uncertainty in the absolute value of \lambda(0) we used a procedure similar to that one described in Refs. [9] and [12]. The temperature dependence of \lambda(T) was calculated for N(R)+\langle\overline{N(R)}\rangle and N(R)-\langle\overline{N(R)}\rangle distributions. The fit of the resulting \lambda(T) curves with the power law as well as with the BCS model gives \lambda(0) in the range from 110 to 170 nm. Note that the values of the power exponent n (zero temperature superconducting gap \Delta_{0}) were found to be well within error bars for each series of \lambda(T) curves.

Figure 3(a) shows the pressure dependence of \lambda^{-2}(0) obtained by fitting the reconstructed \lambda(T) data at different pressures with the BCS model [Eq. (5)]. In these experiments we studied relative effects measured on the same sample in the same pressure cell. The main systematic error of these measurements comes from misalignments of the experimental setup occurring when the cell is removed from the SQUID magnetometer, to change the pressure, and put back again. This procedure was checked with a set of measurements at constant pressure. The systematic scattering of the magnetization data is about 0.3%, giving a relative error in \lambda^{-2}(T) of about 3%. The reducing of the grain size with pressure was taken into account in \lambda(T) calculation [Eq. (4)], by using the bulk modulus reported above. The linear fit yields \lambda^{-2}(0) =48.4(7)+0.29(11)p, implying that \lambda^{-2} increases under pressure with d\ln\lambda^{-2}(0)/dp= 0.60(23)% /kbar [see Fig. 3(a)].

To analyze the observed effect we used a procedure similar to the one described by Di Castro _et al.[10]_ There it was suggested that \lambda^{-2} increases under pressure because of two reasons, (i) band structure effects and (ii) renormalization of the electron-phonon coupling.[10] Under the assumption of ellipsoidal or cylindrical Fermi surface the first one can be obtained as[10]

\[\frac{d\ln\lambda^{-2}(0)}{dp}=\frac{1}{3B}-\frac{d\ln N(E_{f})}{dp}\simeq \frac{1}{3B}-\frac{1}{B}\frac{d\ln\eta}{d\ln V}.\] (6)

Here we used the fact that the pressure dependence of the electronic matrix element \langle I^{2}\rangle entering the Hopfeld parameter \eta can usually be neglected.[31] Hence, by setting d\ln\eta/d\ln V= -1, and B= 2490 kbar (see above) we obtain d\ln\lambda^{-2}(0)/dp= 0.05% /kbar.

Lines represent fits with the BCS model (dashed line), and with a power law (solid line). See text for an explanation. The inset shows the volume fraction distribution N(R)R^{3} of the ZrB_{12} powder determined from SEM photographs. The errors are statistical. The solid line represents the analytical g(R) function used in Eq. (4).

  The electron-phonon renormalized penetration depth reduces to \lambda^{*-2}(0)=\lambda^{-2}(0)/(1+\lambda_{\rm el-ph}),^{7} where \lambda(0) is the bare quantity we have considered before. We have then

\[\frac{d\ln\lambda^{*-2}(0)}{dp}=-\frac{\lambda_{\rm el-ph}}{1+\lambda_{\rm el- ph}}\frac{d\ln\lambda_{\rm el-ph}}{dp}.\] (7)

By substituting \lambda_{\rm el-ph}= 0.67 (Ref. [3]) and d\ln\lambda_{\rm el-ph}/dp\approx-0.2% /kbar obtained above we get d\ln\lambda^{*-2}(0)/dp\approx 0.08% /kbar.^{32} Thus the total pressure shift of \lambda^{-2}(0) expected assuming conventional (adiabatic) coupling of the charge carriers to the lattice in ZrB_{12} is of the order of 0.13% /kbar. This value is more than three times smaller than the experimentally observed one 0.60(23)% /kbar. This implies that in addition to band structure effects and renormalization of the electron-phonon coupling there are other effects responsible for the increasing of \lambda^{-2}(0) under pressure. Bearing in mind that \lambda measurements have been performed in a Meissner state, the observed dependence of \lambda on p can be explained suggesting that in ZrB_{12} close to the surface the coupling of the charge carriers to the lattice has a nonadiabatic character. Note that similar effects have been observed in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} that appears to be a highly nonadiabatic superconductor.^{12}

The results on the zero temperature superconducting gap \Delta_{0} are summarized in Fig. 3(b), where the ratio 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c} is plotted as a function of the pressure p. \Delta_{0} and T_{c} were obtained from the fit of \lambda^{-2}(T,p) data by using Eq. (5). The solid line represents a fit by the relation 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=const to the data. Bearing in mind that T_{c} scales linearly with pressure (see Fig. 1) the constant ratio can be understood in the frame of the BCS theory, which predicts 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=3.52. In the present study this ratio was found to be pressure independent within experimental errors, with mean value 4.79(1).

## IV Conclusions

In conclusion, we performed magnetization measurements in ZrB_{12} under hydrostatic pressure. A negative pressure effect on T_{c} with dT_{c}/dp= -0.0225(3) K/kbar is observed. The electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{\rm el-ph} decreases with pressure with d\ln\lambda_{\rm el-ph}/dp\approx-0.20% /kbar. The magnetic field penetration depth \lambda measured in the Meissner state is largely determined by the surface characteristics.^{33}\lambda was found to increase with pressure, with the pressure effect coefficient d\ln\lambda^{-2}(0)/dp=0.60(23)% /kbar. This coefficient is much larger than that one estimated theoretically within the adiabatic approximation. This can be explained suggesting that in ZrB_{12}, close to the surface, the coupling of the charge carriers to the lattice has a nonadiabatic character. The ratio 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=4.79(1) is found to be pressure independent and close to the strong coupling BCS value 4.8(1) reported in Refs. [3] and [6]. The value of \lambda extrapolated to zero temperature and at p=0 was estimated to be 140(30) nm.

* [33] Generally properties within 140 nm from the surface are assumed to be bulk. However, difference between "bulk" and "surface" notations depends strongly on the physical phenomenon studied. The length where superconducting properties are changed is the coherence length. It follows from direct magnetization measurements by Tsindlekht _et al._ (Ref. [6]) and Wang _et al._ (Ref. [28]) that in the case of Z{\rm B_{12}} the coherence length is of the order of the magnetic penetration depth. That is why we consider the properties within the depth of 140 nm as superconducting surface ones.
