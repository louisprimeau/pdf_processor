###### Abstract

Superconductivity (SC) and charge-density wave (CDW) are two contrasting
yet relevant collective electronic states, which have received sustained
interest for decades. Here, we report that, in a layered europium
bismuth sulfofluoride, EuBiS₂F, a CDW-like transition occurs at 280 K,
below which SC emerges at 0.3 K, without any extrinsic doping. The Eu
ions were found to exhibit an anomalously temperature-independent mixed
valence of about +2.2, associated with the formation of a possible
dynamic CDW. The mixed valence of Eu gives rise to self electron doping
into the conduction bands mainly consisting of the in-plane Bi6p states,
which in turn brings about the CDW and SC. In particular, the electronic
specific-heat coefficient is enhanced by ∼50 times, owing to the
significant hybridizations between Eu4f and Bi6p electrons, as verified
by band-structure calculations. Thus EuBiS₂F manifests itself as an
unprecedented material that simultaneously accommodates SC, CDW, and
f-electron valence instability.

## I Introduction

Charge-density wave (CDW) and superconductivity (SC) are different
collective electronic orders, although both are associated with Fermi
surface instabilities owing dynamically to electron-phonon interactions
(for conventional BCS superconductors). CDW, usually occurring in
low-dimensional materials, generally shows periodic modulations of
conduction electron density and crystalline lattice in real space. In
contrast, SC, appearing in materials not limiting to low dimensionality,
exhibits an intriguing electronic ordering in momentum space due to
condensation of Cooper pairs, without any static lattice deformation.
Basically, they are competing orders, nevertheless, coexistence of SC
and CDW is frequently observed in low-dimensional systems by various
experiments [1, 2, 3]. In recent years, the relationship between CDW and
SC has become a hot topic in cuprate high-temperature superconductors
[1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] as well as "conventional" superconductors that bear
CDW instability [1, 2, 9]. Currently, accumulating evidences seem to
indicate that CDW serves as an intertwined electronic orders, not simply
competing with SC [10].

Recently, SC was discovered in a quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) bismuth
chalcogenide, LaO_(1 − x)F_(x)BiS₂[11] (the chemical formula is
preferably written as LaBiS₂O_(1 − x)F_(x) according to standard
nomenclature [12]). This new class of materials consists of BiS₂
bilayers that are believed to be responsible for SC. Band structure
calculations [13, 16, 17, 18] reveal that the undoped parent compound
LaBiS₂O belongs to a band insulator with an energy gap of ∼0.8 eV [16,
17, 18]. The conduction bands near Fermi level consist mainly of
in-plane Bi6p orbitals. Upon electron doping, these conduction bands are
partially filled, which leads to Q2D Fermi surface (FS) sheets. A
minimal electronic model including Bi 6_p_x_ and 6_p_y_ orbitals was
thus constructed and investigated [13, 14, 15]. Interestingly, the
resultant two bands have a Q1D character with a double minimum
dispersion, making FS nesting possible. Possible CDW phases due to Q1D
distortions of the Bi and/or S atoms were proposed for x ∼ 0.5[16, 18].
Nevertheless, except for an inflection point in the temperature
dependence of resistivity in La_(0.9)_M__(0.1)BiS₂O (M = Th, Ti, Zr, and
Hf), which was speculated to be related to a CDW effect [19], no more
signatures in physical properties for a CDW transition have been
observed so far.

Here, we report a series of evidences for a CDW-like transition at
T^(*) ∼ 280 K in an isostructural compound, EuBiS₂F, synthesized for the
first time. Unlike other parent compounds such as LaBiS₂O [20] and
SrBiS₂F [21] that are undoped insulators, surprisingly, EuBiS₂F itself
is metallic, and moreover it exhibits SC below 0.3 K. By various
experimental approaches, we demonstrate that EuBiS₂F is actually
self-doped due to partial electron transfer from the Eu ions to the BiS₂
bilayers. The Eu ions exhibit an anomalously temperature-independent
mixed valence of about +2.2. The electronic specific-heat coefficient
extracted from the experimental data is as large as 73 mJ K⁻² mol⁻¹, ∼50
times larger than those of its analogues, suggesting significant
hybridizations between Eu4f and Bi6p electrons, which is reproduced by
first-principles calculations. Therefore, to our knowledge, EuBiS₂F
represents the first material that simultaneously bears SC, CDW, and
f-electron valence instability.

## II Experimental Methods

### Sample’s synthesis

The EuBiS₂F polycrystalline sample was synthesized by a solid-state
reaction in sealed evacuated quartz tubes. All the starting materials
were bought from Alfa Aesar. The stoichiometric mixtures of EuS
[presynthesized by reacting Eu (99.9

### X-ray diffractions and crystal structure

Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out at room temperature (RT)
and at low temperatures down to 13 K on a PANalytical x-ray
diffractometer (Model EMPYREAN) with a monochromatic CuK_(α1) radiation.
The lattice parameters were precisely determined using Si powders as the
internal standard reference material. The crystal structure was refined
based on the CeBiS₂O-type structure model [22] by a Rietveld analysis
using the code RIETAN-2000 [23]. With the exact lattice parameters, all
the structural refinements were easily convergent. The resultant
weighted reliable factor $R_{\rm wp}$ is 7.1

### Physical property measurements

The electrical resistivity was measured with a standard four-electrode
method on a Quantum Design physical property measurement system
(PPMS-9). The as-prepared EuBiS₂F pellet was cut into a thin bar with a
dimension of 2.0 × 1.6× 0.6 mm³, and gold wires (ϕ = 30 μm) were
attached onto the sample’s surface with silver paint. The size of the
contact pads produces a total uncertainty in the absolute values of
resistivity of ±15

### Mossbauer spectroscopy

Mossbauer studies on ¹⁵¹Eu at various temperature (up to 388 K), were
performed by using a conventional constant acceleration drive and ∼50
mCi ¹⁵¹Sm₂O₃ source. All spectra obtained were analyzed in terms of
least square fit procedures to theoretical expected spectra. The
experimental spectra were analyzed by two Lorentzian lines from which
values for the isomer shift (δ) and the spectral area of the resonance
absorption lines were derived. The analysis considered also the exact
shape of the source emission line [25]. The velocity calibration was
performed with an α-iron foil at RT and the reported δ values are
relative to Eu₂O₃ at RT.

### Electronic structure calculations

We carried out electronic structure calculations using the Vienna _ab
initio_ simulation package (vasp) [26]. The experimental crystal
structure parameters at 15 K were employed for the calculations. The
strong Coulomb repulsion of the Eu4f electrons was included using local
spin density approximation plus a U parameter (LSDA+U). The plane-wave
basis energy cutoff was set at 540 eV.

## III Results and discussion

### Crystal structure and bond valence sum of Eu

EuBiS₂F crystallizes in the tetragonal CeBiS₂O-type structure [22] with
space group P4/mmm (No. 129). The crystal structure, shown in the top
inset of Fig. 1(a), can be viewed as an intergrowth of fluorite-like
Eu₂F₂ block layers and NaCl-like BiS₂ bilayers along the
crystallographic c axis. The XRD patterns for the EuBiS₂F sample were
well reproduced using the crystal structure model by Rietveld refinement
[23]. No obvious extra reflections appear, indicating monophasic EuBiS₂F
within the XRD detecting limit (∼2 wt.

The refined structural data were tabulated in Table S1 Ref. [27]. The
room-temperature lattice parameters a [= 4.0508(1) A] and c [=13.5338(3)
A] are 0.7

In order to detect the possible superstructured CDW phase predicted
[16,18], we performed low-temperature XRD measurements down to 13 K. No
splitting for the (200) or (220) peak was detectable, as seen in the
bottom inset of Fig. 1(a). Also, the structural fittings using the
superstructures of $\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{2}\times 1$[16] (with space
group Cmma) or $\sqrt{2}\times 2\sqrt{2}\times 1$[18] (with space group
P22;2) could not give a better refinement. Although static long-range
CDW order cannot be detected by the conventional XRD technique,
considering the strong signals for a CDW-like transition at 280 K (see
the following sections), we suppose that a dynamic and/or short-range
CDW ordering is still likely. Indeed, theoretical calculations [16]
indicate shallowness of the double-well potential with respect to the
in-plane S(1) displacement, which leads to absence of static CDW order.
Further experimental investigations with other techniques such as
synchrotron XRD and electron diffractions at low temperatures are
expected to be helpful to clarify this issue.

Figure 1(b) show temperature dependence of the crystal structural
parameters and the Eu-BVS. The lattice parameters a and c decrease
monotonically with decreasing temperature. A subtle anomaly around 280 K
can be detected, and it is more evident in _c_/_a_ ratio. As stated
above, the decrease in _c_/_a_ means more electron doping on the BiS2
bilayers. Thus the small decrease in _c_/_a_ below 280 K suggests
further electron transfer from the Eu atoms to the BiS2 bilayers with
decreasing temperature. Indeed, the Eu-BVS value exhibits a detectable
variations. At low temperatures, both _c_/_a_ and Eu-BVS saturate,
indicating a stable mixed-valence state for Eu.

### Electrical transport properties

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of resistivity, _r_(_T_), for
the EuBiS2F polycrystalline sample. Unlike the parent compound SrBiS2F
that shows semiconducting behaviour [21,32], EuBiS2F is virtually
metallic, due to the self-doping effect. More surprisingly, the _r_(_T_)
curve exhibits a broad hump below  280 K, resembling the CDW transitions
in Q2D systems like Cu_T_BiSe2 [9]. The resistivity anomaly cannot be
ascribed to the increase of the Eu valence, because the latter would
generate more electron carriers in the conducting BiS2 bilayers, which
would lower (rather than raise) the resistivity. Moreover, the hump is
not even related to the Eu 4f electrons, because we observed a similar
hump, due to the CDW instability, in an Eu-free sample
(Sr0.7Ca0.3)0.75La0.25BiS2F (see Fig. S1 in Ref. [27]). Therefore this
_r_(_T_) hump is interpreted by a gap (probably a pseudogap) opening at
Fermi level (_E_F) because of the formation of dynamic/short-range CDW
below 280 K. Here we note that no obvious nonlinear _IV_ relations
associated with the sliding of CDW was observed down to 2 K.

At low temperatures, a superconducting transition takes place with a
zero-resistance temperature of 0.3 K at zero field [see the inset of
Fig. 2(a)]. The superconducting transition temperature _T_c is reduced
by a factor of 10, compared with the BiS2-based superconductors
synthesized under ambient pressure [28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. This could be
due to the formation of CDW which loses partial FSs, relatively low
electron doping, and/or pair breaking by the Eu magnetic moment. The
superconducting transition was also demonstrated by the
magnetoresistivity measurement at fixed temperatures, as shown in Fig.
2(b). The upper critical fields (_H_c2) were determined using the
criteria of 90

To further understand the anomaly around 280 K in _r_(_T_), we measured
the temperature dependence of Hall coefficient (_R_H). As shown in Fig.
2(c), at room temperature, _R_H is negative, indicating dominant
electron transport. If we assume a single-band scenario, the carrier
density is estimated to be n = 1/e|R_(H)| = (2.1 ± 0.3) × 10²⁷ m-3,
equivalent to a Hall number of V_(cell)/(2e|R_(H)|) = 0.24 ± 0.03
electrons per formula unit (fu). This electron density corresponds to an
Eu valence of +2.24(3), if assuming that all the electron carriers in
the conduction band (CB) come from Eu4f orbitals [see the schematic
energy-band diagrams in Fig. 2(c)]. Below 280 K, _R_H increases steeply,
and then it changes the sign at lower temperatures. This peculiar
_R_H(_T_) behavior strongly suggests FS reconstructions owing to a CDW
transition. In the

(200) and (220) reflections. (b) Temperature dependence of lattice
parameters a, c, _c_/_a_, and the bond valence sum of Eu (Eu-BVS). The

Sr_(1 − x)La_(x)BiS₂F system, as a comparison, the $R_{\rm H}(T)$ is
either positive (for x ≤ 0.45) or negative (for x ≥ 0.5) [32,37,38]. We
speculate that a pseudogap opens below T^(*), which could lower the
$E_{\rm F}$ a little, as shown in the left diagram in Fig. 2(c). As a
result, more transferred electrons are expected, accounting for the
small increase of Eu valence below 280 K.

### Magnetic properties

The magnetic properties Eu²⁺ and Eu³⁺ ions are very different because of
different electron filling on the 4f orbitals (4f⁷ and 4f⁶,
respectively). The ground state of the former is ⁸S_(7/2) with an
effective local-moment of $g\sqrt{S(S+1)}$$\mu_{\rm B}$ = 7.94
$\mu_{\rm B}$ (S = 7/2). In contrast, the ground state of the latter is
⁷F₀, which has zero magnetic moment. Nevertheless, the excited states
⁷F_(J) (J = 1, 2, …, 6), due to the spin-orbit interaction λL **.** S,
give rise to appreciable van Vleck paramagnetic susceptibility
($\chi_{\rm vv}$) [39]. Here the coupling constant λ also measures the
energy of the first excited state. The λ value is 480 K for free Eu³⁺
ions [39], and it has a small change in solids, e.g., λ = 471 K for
EuBO₃ and λ = 490 K for EuF₃[40]. Consequently, the $\chi_{\rm vv}(T)$
is featured by a temperature-independent plateau in the low-temperature
regime (say, T ≤ 100 K), and Curie-like paramagnetism with an effective
magneton number of 3.4 per Eu³⁺ for the high-temperature region (T > 200
K) [40]. In the EuBiS₂F system, therefore, we can correctly analyze the
temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility, χ(T), with an
extended Curie-Weiss law,

$$\chi\,=\,\chi_{0}+C/(T+\theta_{\rm N}).$$
(1)

In the low-temperature limit, the first term χ₀ includes
$\chi_{\rm vv}$, in addition to Pauli paramagnetism (and Landau
diamagnetism) of conduction electrons and Langevin diamagnetism from the
core-shell electrons of all the constituent elements. At the
high-temperature side, $\chi_{\rm vv}$ is included to the second term,
where C denotes Curie constant and $\theta_{\rm N}$ is termed as
paramagnetic Neel temperature. One may obtain the effective moment by
the formulas $\mu_{\rm eff}=\sqrt{3k_{\rm B}C/N_{\rm A}}$, where
$k_{\rm B}$ and $N_{\rm A}$ denote Boltzmann and Avogadro constants,
respectively.

Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility,
χ(T), for the EuBiS₂F sample at T ≤ 100 K. No magnetic transition is
evident down to 2 K. The χ(T) data can be well fitted by Eq. (1), except
for minor deviations below 10 K. The fitted effective paramagnetic
moment is 7.2 $\mu_{\rm B}$ fu⁻¹, which means that the concentration of
Eu²⁺ is 83

Figure 3(b) shows the high-temperature range of χ(T), which was also
fitted with Eq. (1). The fitting gives smaller χ₀ but larger C values,
because $\chi_{\rm vv}$ is now included in the second term of Eq. (1).
By subtraction of the fitted curve from the experimental data, the
residual susceptibility Δχ

criteria of 90

shows a humplike anomaly where the magnetic susceptibility tends to drop
[by (5 +- 2) x 10-5 emu mol-1] at around 280 K. At first sight, it seems
to be related to the change in Eu valence. However, a similar hump in kh
was also observed in an Eu-free analogous sample,
(Sr0.7Ca0.3)0.75La0.25BiS2F (see Fig. S2 in Ref. [27]). Thus we
speculate that the "drop" of kh at 280 K mainly results from the loss of
Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility when a (pseudo)gap opens at the CDW
transition. Here, we note that the decrease of $N(E_{\rm F})$ in the CDW
phase for LaBiS2O0.5,F0.5 calculated [18] is just equivalent to the loss
of Pauli magnetic susceptibility.

The possible variation in Eu valence can be analyzed as follows. If P₃₊
denotes the concentration of Eu3+ [so that the fraction of Eu2+ is
(1-P₃₊)], and assuming that kh0 were temperature independent, one may
calculate P₃₊ by the relation

$$\chi=\chi_{0}+P_{3+}\frac{C_{3+}}{T}+(1-P_{3+})\frac{C_{2+}}{T+\theta_{\rm N}}.$$
(2)

With C₂₊ = 7.875 emu mol-1 K-1 and C₃₊ = 1.45 emu mol-1 K-1 (equivalent
to 3.40 $\mu_{\rm B}$ fu-1) [40], the Eu valence was obtained as plotted
in Fig. 3(d). The subtle anomaly around 280 K should be predominately
due to the actual change in kh0, as discussed above. However, the Eu
valence does tend to increase below 220 K, which is quantitatively
consistent with the Eu-BVS values shown in Fig. 1(b).

One may also obtain the information of Eu valence from the
field-dependent magnetization at 2 K [Fig. 3(c)], which shows a
saturation at high magnetic fields. The saturation magnetization is
significantly smaller than the expected value (gS = 7.0$\mu_{\rm B}$
fu-1) for Eu2+ions only. By fitting the M(H) data using a Brillouin
function with consideration of Weiss molecular field $B_{\rm mf}=\xi M$,
the saturation magnetization is determined to be 5.58 $\mu_{\rm B}$
fu-1, corresponding to the Eu valence of +2.20, consistent with the
conclusion from the Curie-Weiss fitting above. The fitted parameter ξ is
a negative value (−0.40), reflecting dominant antiferromagnetic
interactions among the Eu localized moments, also agreeing with the
positive value of $\theta_{\rm N}$ fitted with Eq. (1).

### Mossbauer spectroscopy

Mossbauer spectroscopy (MS) is a powerful technique to study the Eu
valence. The isomer shift δ of the nuclei of Eu2+ and Eu3+ ions falls in
two nonoverlapping ranges: δ₂₊ = −7.7 ∼ −13.5 mm/s and
δ₃₊ = −0.01 ∼ +2.6 mm/s (relative to ¹⁵¹Eu₂O₃). Thus MS easily
identifies the valence state of Eu and, in the case of inhomogeneous
mixed valence, the concentration of each Eu species can be determined by
the relative absorption intensity. For the fast valence fluctuation (VF)
scenario, the mean Eu valence can also be quantitatively evaluated by
the shift in δ[42]. MS may also supply information on quadrupole and
magnetic interactions.

Figure 4(a) shows the ¹⁵¹Eu Mossbauer spectra at some typical
temperatures of 90, 200, 297, and 388 K. At low temperatures (90 and 200
K), two absorption lines (or peaks) appear at −13.5 and −0.5 mm/s, which
are obviously identified to the Mossbauer resonance absorptions of Eu2+
and Eu3+ nuclei, respectively. Since there is only one equivalent site
in the crystal structure even at low temperatures, the two separate
lines indicate slow Eu VFs (or even static charge ordering of Eu2+ and
Eu3+) with the time scale of $\tau_{\rm rf}>10^{-8}$ s (note that the
probing time of MS is about 10⁻⁹ s). The intensity of the minor line is
about 1/3 of the major one, therefore, the mean Eu valence is  ∼ +2.25,
basically consistent with the above conclusion drawn from the crystal
structure and magnetic data. As the temperature is increased

field of 1 kOe [(a) T ≤ 100 K and (b) T ≥ 220 K]. The solid lines are

experimental data and the fitted ones is shown in the lower part of (b).

susceptibility. See details in the text.

to 297 K, the intensity of the Eu³⁺ line decreases remarkably.
Simultaneously, the two absorption lines get closer, and the linewidth
is abnormally large (up to 5 mm/s). This fact suggests Eu VFs with the
characteristic τ_(vf) close to 10⁻⁹ s, associated with the electron
hopping between Eu²⁺ and Eu³⁺. At 388 K, the Eu³⁺ line almost vanishes
because the VFs are much faster. The residual tiny Eu³⁺ peak could be
due to traces of EuF₃ and/or Eu₂O₃ (originated from unavoidable oxygen
contamination during the sample preparation) impurities [43]. In the
fast VF limit, the isomer shift is then formulated by
δ_(vf) = (1 − P₃₊)δ₂₊ + P₃₊δ₃₊. With δ_(vf) = −11.6 mm/s, δ₂₊ = −13.5
mm/s, and δ₃₊ = 0 mm/s, the Eu valence at 388 K can be estimated to be
+2.14(2).

By data fitting using the exact shape of the emission spectrum of
¹⁵¹Sm₂O₃ and considering quadrupole interactions, we were able to obtain
the refined δ, the full linewidth at half maximum (Γ) and the peak
intensities (I), which are plotted respectively in Fig. 4(b). All these
MS parameters point to a transition at 280 K. The most prominent feature
is that the Γ value is peaked at 280 K. The sharp decrease in Γ below
280 K suggests slowing down of the Eu VFs, probably in connection with
the dynamic CDW. One may estimate the percentages of fast (τ_(vf) < 10⁻⁹
s) and slow (τ_(vf) > 10⁻⁹ s) VFs by the changes in the isomer shifts
and in the relative intensity of Eu³⁺, respectively. At 273 K, for
example, the percentage of fast-VF Eu³⁺ is 5(1)

### Specific heat

The heat capacity of a solid may supply important information not only
for phase transitions but also for electronic and magnetic states.
Figure 5(a) shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat C(T)
for the EuBiS₂F sample. The C(T) data tend to saturate to 120 J K⁻¹
mol⁻¹ at RT, consistent with the high-T limit for the lattice specific
heat (i.e., the Dulong-Petit value 3N R = 15R = 124.7 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹, where
N counts the number of elements per fu, R is the gas constant). One sees
an anomaly around 280 K, a signal of second-order transition, further
supporting a CDW-like transition.

In EuBiS₂F, the specific heat is due to several different origins
including crystalline lattice (C_(lat)), conduction electron (C_(el)),
and Eu magnetism (C_(m)). One may correctly separate them out by
considering different contribution weights in different temperature
regions. Since no magnetic ordering takes place above 2 K, and the
magnetic susceptibility follows well the Curie-Weiss law above 10 K,
C_(m) is then expected to be very small above 10 K at zero magnetic
field. Therefore we make use of a conventional approach, in which the
low-T lattice contribution is taken as βT³, to extract C_(el). The plot
of C/T versus T² in the inset of Fig. 5(a) gives γ = 73.3 mJ K⁻² mol⁻¹
and β = 1.19 mJ K⁻⁴ mol⁻¹. The resultant Debye temperature,
θ_(D) = [(12/5)NRπ⁴/β]^(1/3) = 201 K, is reasonably in between those of
LaBiS₂O_(0.5)F_(0.5) (221 K) and YbBiS₂O_(0.5)F_(0.5) (186 K) [19],
which vice versa guarantee the reliability of the Sommerfeld parameter.
Notably, the fitted γ value is over 50 times of that of
Sr_(0.5)La_(0.5)BiS₂F (1.42 mJ K⁻² mol⁻¹) [32]. Its corresponding
N(E_(F)) [ = 3γ/(πR_(B))²] is as large as 30 eV⁻¹ fu⁻¹, which is about
25 times of the bare density of states of LaBiS₂O_(0.5)F_(0.5) (1.22
eV⁻¹ fu⁻¹) [17]. The greatly enhanced γ is related to the unusually
large Pauli magnetic susceptibility above, mainly originating from the
hybridization between conduction electrons and the Eu 4f electrons (see
band-structure calculations in Sec. III.6).

Figure 5(b) zooms in the C(T) data below 20 K. At zero magnetic field, a
peak appears at 1.6 K with a high maximum up to 10.41 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹. Under
a magnetic field of 5 T, the peak is suppressed, forming a broad hump
centered at about 3.5 K. Since the ground state of Eu²⁺ has zero orbital
angular momentum, Schottky-like contribution is not expected. Hence the
peak should be of magnetic origin. It is noted that, on the right side
of the peak, there is no discontinuous jump (or divergence) in specific
heat, as opposed to an ordinary long-range magnetic ordering. This lets
us consider that the specific anomaly comes from freezing of nonordered
Eu²⁺ spins, i.e., a spin glass transition. Similar observation was
reported in (Eu,Sr)S [44] and EuCu₂Si₂[45]. To extract C_(m) below 10 K
more accurately, the C(T) data from 10 to 20 K were fitted by a
polynomial with odd-power terms, C≈

$C_{\rm el}+C_{\rm lat}=A_{1}T+A_{3}T^{3}+A_{5}T^{5}+A_{7}T^{7}$ (the
resultant A₁ and A₃ agree well with the above γ and β values). Then, the
magnetic contribution $C_{\rm m}$ below 10 K was obtained by removing
the contributions of $C_{\rm lat}$ and $C_{\rm el}$. Consequently, the
magnetic entropy can be calculated by
$S_{\rm m}=\int_{0}^{T}(C_{\rm m}/T)dT$, as shown in Fig. 5(c), which is
12.4 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹ at 20 K under zero field. Furthermore, nearly the same
$S_{\rm m}$ value can be achieved under 5 T for integrating up to 60 K.
The released magnetic entropy equals to 72

### Band-structure calculations

To interpret the above experimental results, we performed a
first-principles calculation using local spin density approximation with
consideration of on-site Coulomb interaction (LSDA+_U_), particularly
paying attention to the Eu 4f electronic states (the issue of CDW
instability was well documented by Yildirim [18]). We first investigated
the influence of the parameter U. Figure 6(a) shows the variations of Eu
4f bands of EuBiS2F with U = 0, 1, ..., 6 eV. In all cases, there is a
large gap between occupied and unoccupied levels, as shown in the inset.
Another prominent feature is that the highest occupied band (HOB) is
located around $E_{\rm F}$, regardless of the different U values. This
fact suggests that the Eu 4f frontier occupied level in the HOB is
pinned by the chemical potential of the conduction bands. The filled
states in HOB actually represent Eu²⁺, whilst the empty states in HOB,
i.e., the 4f holes, correspond to Eu³⁺.

Figure 6(b) shows the calculated band structure of EuBiS2F with a
realistic value of U = 3 eV. There are seven flat bands near
$E_{\rm F}$, all coming from the Eu 4f orbitals. The HOB crosses
$E_{\rm F}$, and hybridizes with the Bi 6p bands (see the zoom-in plot
at the bottom). Furthermore, this HOB donates electrons to the Bi 6p
bands, and leaves hole pockets around the **M** point [see also the FS
in Fig. 6(d)]. Consequently, although undoped, the CB of EuBiS2F is
filled with the transferred electrons. Due to the Q2D structure,
cylindriclike FSs are present [Fig. 6(d)]. Except for the 4_f_-hole
pockets, two electron-type FS sheets appear around the **X** point,
similar to the case of LaBiS2O1-xF${}_{\rm x}$ with x = 0.25[13]. This
2D-like FS sheets have considerable nesting areas for developing CDW
instability.

Figure 6(c) shows the calculated electronic DOS of EuBiS2F. Obviously,
the sharp peaks come from the Eu 4f orbitals. They are basically divided
into two groups, which are about 7 eV apart (corresponding to an
effective Hubbard U ∼ 7 eV). The frontier HOB nearby $E_{\rm F}$ has
mainly contributions from the f_(x2)’ wave function. The DOS at
$E_{\rm F}$, $N(E_{\rm F})$, mainly comprises of Bi6p (0.75 x 2 eV⁻¹
fu⁻¹) and Eu4f (21.6 eV⁻¹ fu⁻¹). The total $N(E_{\rm F})$ is about 20
times of that of LaBiS2O0.5F0.5[17], well accounting for the enhancement
of electronic specific-heat coefficient as well as Pauli susceptibility.

## IV Concluding remarks

We have demonstrated a series of signatures for a CDW-like transition in
EuBiS2F, albeit no static long-range superlattice order was detected by
XRD. They include a clear kink in the c/a ratio, a resistivity hump, a
kink in the Hall coefficient, a subtle magnetic susceptibility change,
and a specific-heat hump, all at T^(*) ∼ 280 K. The slowing down of Eu
VFs below T^(*) suggests a dynamic CDW scenario. Such a dynamic CDW is
supported by the theoretical calculations,

which indicate dynamic in-plane displacements of S(1) owing to the
shallowness of the double-well potential [16]. Very recently,
"checkerboard stripe" electronic state was observed on the cleaved
surface of NdO_(0.7)F_(0.3)BiS₂ single crystals [46]. Although the
nanoscale electronic inhomogeneity was considered to be due to the
atomic defects on the cleaved surface, it could be in some relation to
the CDW instability.

As is known, CDW instability mostly originates from the FS nesting
[1,2]. Since the shape and the size of the FS sheets are predominantly
decided by the electron filling in the CB of BiS₂-based materials [13],
the electron doping level should be crucial for the occurrence of CDW.
Our finding in EuBiS₂F implies that the CDW instability is optimized at
around x ∼ 0.2. To verify this point, we synthesized samples of
(Sr,Ca)_(0.75)La_(0.25)BiS₂F, in which the electron doping was fixed to
x = 0.25. We indeed observed a similar CDW anomaly in this designed
system (see Figs. S1 and S2 in Ref. [27]).

It is due to the mixed valence of Eu that considerable amount of
electron carriers are transferred into the CB, which induces SC as well
as CDW instability. Table 1 summarizes the Eu valence in EuBiS₂F
determined via various methods at different temperature ranges.
Basically, the Eu valence is about +2.2, nearly independent of
temperature down to 2 K. This result is very unusual, since the Eu
valence mostly increases remarkably with decreasing temperature, e.g.,
in the systems of EuM₂Si₂ (M= Cu [42], Pd [47], Ir [48,49]) and
EuNi₂P₂[49,50] where Eu VFs were present. As for the crystal structure
of EuBiS₂F, there is only one crystallographic site for the Eu ions.
Therefore the mixed valence of Eu means existence of VFs. Indeed,
according to the Mossbauer results above, VFs are dominant above
T^(*) = 280 K. Around T^(*), however, the VF frequency decreases
rapidly. At temperatures far below T^(*), the VFs of Eu²⁺ and Eu³⁺ are
slower than 10⁸ Hz. These observations suggest that Eu should have
unequivalent Eu sites in a short-time scale, which could be realized in
the proposed CDW phase with distortions of BiS(1) layers [18]. Thus the
Eu valence is "pinned" by the CDW-like transition [see the schematic
energy-band diagrams for the T < T^(*) scenario in Fig. 2(c)], resulting
in the unique temperature-independent mixed valence. In turn, the Eu VFs
(no matter how slow they are) should be in favor of an unusual dynamic
CDW state.

The emergence of SC under the CDW-like transition suggests that EuBiS₂F
is also a CDW superconductor, like the well known NbSe₂[1, 2, 3]. The
formation of CDW generally loses a portion of FSs, which leads to a
decrease of $T_{\rm c}$. In this sense, CDW competes with SC, as usual.
However, an anharmonic model calculation [16] shows that the CDW
instability is also essential for the SC, suggesting a more profound
relationship between SC and CDW.

Finally, we would like to emphasize that the occurrence of SC at the
(self) electron doping level corresponding to x ∼ 0.2 is also
surprising. Previous reports [37,38] indicate that, in an analogous
system of Sr_(1 − x)La_(x)BiS₂F, SC appears for x > 0.3, below which the
samples show _insulating_ behavior, and the optimal doping is at
x ∼ 0.5. According to the band structure calculations [13,16, 17, 18],
the FSs undergo a Lifshitz transition, characterized by a change in FS
topology, with electron doping. The two doping levels, x ∼ 0.2 and
x ∼ 0.5, have very different FS topologies. Therefore the
superconducting state in EuBiS₂F might be different from those of other
BiS₂-based materials. It was predicted that [15], below the Lifshitz
filling level (like the case of EuBiS₂F), the superconducting state is
weak topological due to strong spin-orbit coupling. Further
investigations are called for to verify this prediction.
