The normal-state electrical-transport properties of various cuprates have been studied to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity.1,2 The Seebeck effect is one of the transport properties complementary to the Hall effect and electrical conductivity. For most of the superconducting cuprates, around room temperature the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient (_d_) for sintered samples decreases with increasing temperature.2 This behavior of d is contrary to that known for uncorrelated electrons in conventional metals.

For (_L_2/5Ce1/3)4(La1/3Ba1/3Sr1/3)4Cu6O where L is a rare-earth element and located in the fluorite-type block in the crystal structure that is it has a (Eu,Ce)4(Ba, Eu)4Cu6O7-type phase3 or a 4:4:6 phase], Wada _et al._4 reported that the magnitude of _Tc_ strongly depended on the radius of the L3+ ion. This contrasts to the case of _L_Ba2Cu3O7 (1:2:3 phase) where the magnitude of _Tc_ depends little on the radius of the L3+ ion. The samples 4:4:6-phase compounds with L = Eu, Dy, Y, and Ho had nearly identical oxygen contents4 and Hall coefficients when the temperature was between room temperature and 150 K.5 Therefore, _Tc_ of (_L_2/5Ce1/3)4(La1/3Ba1/3Sr1/3)4Cu6O7 must be controlled by some unknown factors (other than the hole concentration) which may be related to the radius of the L3+ ion. In this work, we measured the Seebeck coefficients for ceramic samples of the 4:4:6 phase and the _T_* phase to investigate the unknown factors.

Two sets of samples were prepared. Each of the sets consisted of two samples having nearly the same carrier concentration, one being superconducting (_Tc_ > 20 K) and the other nonsuperconducting (_Tc_ < 2 K). The superconducting transition temperature _Tc_ was defined by the onset of the diamagnetic signal in dc magnetic susceptibility. The first set consisted of (_L_2/5Ce1/3)4(La1/3Ba1/3Sr1/3)4Cu6O7 with L = Eu (Eu 4:4:6) and L = Y (Y 4:4:6). The samples were prepared by the same procedure as that given in Refs. 4 and 5. _Tc_ for Eu 4:4:6 was 28.5 K. For Y 4:4:6 no superconducting transition was observed down to 2 K. This corresponds to the fact that _Tc_ decreases as the size of the L3+ ion decreases.4

The samples of the second set were Nd1.4Ce0.2Sr0.4-Cu1-_x_Zn_x_O4-_d_ with x = (D*S) and x = 0.015 (T*N), which were prepared6 by a standard solid-state reaction method. Both samples were sintered at 1150degC for 10 h followed by annealing at 500 degC for 10 h in O2-gas flow and confirmed to be of single phase of the _T_*-type by x-ray powder diffraction. As the Zn content x increased, _Tc_ decreased monotonically.6 The _Tc_'s for the samples with x = 0 and 0.015 were 23.1 K and less than 2 K, respectively. For comparison, parallel measurements were made for a sintered sample 6 of La1.85Sr0.15CuO4-_d_ (_T_ phase: _Tc_ = 38.3 K).

The Seebeck coefficients were measured by a dc differential method at temperatures between 20 and 310 K. The temperature and temperature gradient across the sample were measured using a calibrated Si-diode sensor and two pairs of copper-Constantan thermocouples, respectively. The Cu wires of 50-_m_m diameter were used as the reference metal. The sample dimension was 7 x 2.5 x 1 mm3. The Hall-effect and resistivity measurements were simultaneously made under the same conditions as those employed in Ref. 5.

The Seebeck coefficient d for La1.85Sr0.15CuO4-_d_ is plotted in Fig. 1 with open circles. The _d_-_vs_-_T_ curve has a maximum around 90 K, as previously reported.2,7 Figure 1 also includes the data for the temperature dependence of d and resistivity (_r_) for the 4:4:6 samples. The _d_-_vs_-_T_ curve for Eu 4:4:6 (crosses in Fig. 1) has a peak (at T_{q}) around 170 K and is nearly identical with that for La1.85Sr0.15CuO4-_d_ at temperatures above 200 K. Throughout the measured temperature range, d for Y 4:4:6 (solid triangles in Fig. 1) is larger than that for Eu 4:4:6. T_{q} for Y 4:4:6 is 190 K, which is slightly higher than that for Eu 4:4:6. The resistivity of Y 4:4:6 is larger than that for Eu 4:4:6, especially at temperatures below 100 K. Each of the _r_-_vs_-_T_ curves possesses a minimum between 120-130 K. The Hall coefficients (R_{H}) of the  two samples were identical, within an uncertainty of +- 4%, at temperatures higher than 150 K (see Fig. 2 of Ref. [5]). R_{H} of these samples exhibited a broad peak with respect to temperature located around 110-130 K. [5]

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of d and r for the _T_* samples. The _d_-vs-_T_ curve for T*S (solid circles in Fig. 2) shows a maximum at _Tq_ = 160 K. When the Cu sites are substituted by Zn, the magnitude of d is raised throughout the measured temperature range, and _Tq_ shifts from 160 K to 210 K. At the same time, the magnitude of r is increased especially at temperatures lower than 150 K. Each of the _r_-vs-_T_ curves has a minimum at 110-130 K. The Hall coefficients for the T*N at temperatures higher than 150 K are nearly the same as those of the T*S as shown in Fig. 3. The temperature dependence of R_{H} for each of these samples exhibits a peak in the temperature range of 130-150 K, and, at temperatures lower than the peak temperature, the slope of the _R__H_-vs-_T_ curves decreases with decreasing T_{c}, as previously observed for the 4:4:6 samples. [5]

The _d_-vs-_T_ curves for the 4:4:6 (Fig. 1) and _T_* phases (Fig. 2) are slightly different from that for La1.85-Sr0.15CuO4-_δ_ (Fig. 1). The superconducting samples of both the 4:4:6 and _T_* phases, i.e., Eu 4:4:6 and T*S, show nearly identical _d_-vs-_T_ curves. For each of the two phases, the difference in d of the nonsuperconducting and superconducting samples (D_δ_) is plotted with respect to temperature in Fig. 4. The temperature dependence of D_δ_ for the 4:4:6 samples is similar to that for the _T_* samples. At low temperatures (below 150 K for the 4:4:6 phase and below 130 K for the _T_* phase), D_δ_ is independent of temperature. At high temperatures, D_δ_ increases with increasing temperature, although the data for temperatures above 260 K are rather scattered probably because of poor temperature control. Thus, the differences in _δ_, R_{H}, and r of the nonsuperconducting and superconducting samples seem to be qualitatively different in the high- and low-temperature ranges, being separated around 110-150 K. The experimental results for both the 4:4:6 and _T_* samples are summarized as follows: (1) In the high-temperature range--higher than 150 K--_R__H_ of the nonsuperconducting compound is nearly identical with that of the superconducting compound, and also the _r_'s of

Figure 1: Temperature dependence of Seebeck coefficients and resistivity for Nd1.4Ce0.2Sr0.4Cu1−2 Zn0.4Cu−8 with x = 0 (T*S, T_{c} = 23.1 K) and x = 0.015 (T*N, T_{c} < 2 K). The curves in the lower portion show fits to Eq. (1).

  the two compounds are not very different; (2) in the same temperature range, however, \delta of the nonsuperconducting compound is larger than that of the superconducting compound; (3) in the low-temperature range lower than 150 K, the nonsuperconducting compound has larger \delta, R_{H}, and \rho than those of the superconducting compound.

It was reported [7] for (La, Ba)_{2}CuO_{4} and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} that, when the density of doped holes decreased, both \delta and R_{H} increased in the temperature range between T_{c} and 300 K. In the present work, result (2) may not be caused by a difference in the hole density but by a difference in the carrier-scattering contribution, because of result (1). On the other hand, in the low-temperature range, result (3) implies that the mobile-carrier concentrations of the nonsuperconducting and superconducting compounds are different. [5] Nonetheless, the relation between the high- and low-temperature transport properties is not clear.

So far it has been demonstrated that the difference in the transport properties between Y 4:4:6 and Eu 4:4:6 appears to be parallel to that between T*N and T*S, in spite of the fact that the nature of Eu(Y) atomic site in the 4:4:6 phase is different from that of Cu(Zn) atomic site in the _T*_ phase. Therefore, the dependence of T_{c} on the size of the L^{3+} ion in the 4:4:6 phase and the decrease in T_{c} by Zn doping in the _T*_ phase are suspected to have the same origin. The substitution of Zn for Cu in the _T*_ phase is expected to cause a deterioration in the antiferromagnetic correlations between Cu^{2+} spins [6] and a disorder (in the potential energy) in the CuO_{2} planes. These effects may bring about additional carrier scattering and/or a change in the energy dependence of the carrier mean free path, and consequently an increase in \delta. In the 4:4:6 phase, a similar disorder may be caused in the CuO_{2} planes by the change in the radius of the L^{3+} ion. Such a disorder may be induced by oxygen defects in the fluorite-type block in the crystal, and the mismatch in the lattice dimension between the CuO_{2} plane and the underlying fluorite-type block.

Recently, using a gauge-field theory for a uniform resonating-valence-band (RVB) state, Nagaosa and Lee [8] proposed that, for the superconducting cuprates, \delta = \delta_{F}, +\delta_{B} (NL model), where \delta_{F} and \delta_{B} were estimated -- using the Fermi statistics and Maxwellian statistics, respectively--to be -(k_{B}/e)k_{B}T/E_{F} and (k_{B}/e)11 -\ln(2\pi p_{\rm sh}/mk_{B}T). The p_{\rm sh} denotes concentration of holes on CuO_{2} sheets per [Cu-O]. In order to fit the present experimental data to this equation, m and E_{F} were regarded as fitting parameters. However, thus-fitted curves were not in reasonable agreement with the experimental data. An additional parameter F may be introduced as follows:

\[\delta(T)=(k_{B}/e)[1-F\ln(2\pi p_{\rm sh}G/T)-T/H]\ ,\] (1)

where F, G, and H are fitting parameters. Assuming p_{\rm sh} = 0.14 for all the samples and using a least-squares method, these three parameters were determined for each sample, as listed in Table 1. In the NL model, [8] the values for parameters G (\simm^{-1}) and H (\simE_{F}) are expected to be of the order of the exchange energy J \sim 1000 K. The values for G and H given in Table 1 are roughly of the same order as those anticipated by the NL model. The solid and dashed curves in the lower portion of Figs. 1 and 2 are the fitted curves using Eq. (1). These fitted curves, especially for Eu 4:4:6, T*S, and T samples, are in good agreement with the experimental curves. Therefore, if the temperature dependence of \delta is given by the relation: \delta = \delta_{F} + \delta_{B}, the logarithmic term in \delta_{B} is required to be modified by parameter F. This suggests that the chemical potential of the boson system is smaller (by a factor F \sim 0.3) than that of the Maxwell distribution in the two-dimensional system employed in the NL model. Equation (1) can explain the decrease in \delta with increasing temperature at room temperature and the maximum of \delta at 100-250 K that have been often observed for superconducting cuprates. [2] It should be noted, however, that the present \delta-vs-T curves at temperatures below 100 K show a linear behavior rather than the logarithmic behavior of Eq. (1). Alternative explanations for the discrepancy between the experimental results and the NL model can be made based on certain carrier-dragging effects by phonons, spins, and/or gauge field (photons).

In summary, the Seebeck coefficients for (L_{2/3}Ce_{1/3})_{4}(La_{1/3}Ba_{1/3}Sr_{1/3})_{4}CuO_{2} (L = Eu and Y) and Nd_{1/4}Ce_{0.2}Sr_{0.4}Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x}O_{4-\delta} (x = 0 and 0.015) were positive and had maxima around 160-210 K. For each of the 4:4:6 phase and the _T*_ phase in the high-temperature range (T > 150 K), R_{H} of the nonsuperconducting compound (i.e., Y 4:4:6 or T*S) was nearly the same as that of the superconducting compound, but \delta of the nonsuper

This suggests that the contribution from carrier scattering to d is different between the nonsuperconducting and superconducting compounds. In the low-temperature range (_T_ < 150 K), the nonsuperconducting compound had larger values not only for d but also for R_{H} and r than those of the superconducting compound. Further studies are required to determine the relation between the high-temperature (_T_ > 150 K) and low-temperature (_T_ < 150 K) transport properties.

 The normal-state electrical-transport properties of various cuprates have been studied to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity.1,2 The Seebeck effect is one of the transport properties complementary to the Hall effect and electrical conductivity. For most of the superconducting cuprates, around room temperature the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient (_d_) for sintered samples decreases with increasing temperature.2 This behavior of d is contrary to that known for uncorrelated electrons in conventional metals.

For (_L_2/5Ce1/3)4(La1/3Ba1/3Sr1/3)4Cu6O where L is a rare-earth element and located in the fluorite-type block in the crystal structure that is it has a (Eu,Ce)4(Ba, Eu)4Cu6O7-type phase3 or a 4:4:6 phase], Wada _et al._4 reported that the magnitude of _Tc_ strongly depended on the radius of the L3+ ion. This contrasts to the case of _L_Ba2Cu3O7 (1:2:3 phase) where the magnitude of _Tc_ depends little on the radius of the L3+ ion. The samples 4:4:6-phase compounds with L = Eu, Dy, Y, and Ho had nearly identical oxygen contents4 and Hall coefficients when the temperature was between room temperature and 150 K.5 Therefore, _Tc_ of (_L_2/5Ce1/3)4(La1/3Ba1/3Sr1/3)4Cu6O7 must be controlled by some unknown factors (other than the hole concentration) which may be related to the radius of the L3+ ion. In this work, we measured the Seebeck coefficients for ceramic samples of the 4:4:6 phase and the _T_* phase to investigate the unknown factors.

Two sets of samples were prepared. Each of the sets consisted of two samples having nearly the same carrier concentration, one being superconducting (_Tc_ > 20 K) and the other nonsuperconducting (_Tc_ < 2 K). The superconducting transition temperature _Tc_ was defined by the onset of the diamagnetic signal in dc magnetic susceptibility. The first set consisted of (_L_2/5Ce1/3)4(La1/3Ba1/3Sr1/3)4Cu6O7 with L = Eu (Eu 4:4:6) and L = Y (Y 4:4:6). The samples were prepared by the same procedure as that given in Refs. 4 and 5. _Tc_ for Eu 4:4:6 was 28.5 K. For Y 4:4:6 no superconducting transition was observed down to 2 K. This corresponds to the fact that _Tc_ decreases as the size of the L3+ ion decreases.4

The samples of the second set were Nd1.4Ce0.2Sr0.4-Cu1-_x_Zn_x_O4-_d_ with x = (D*S) and x = 0.015 (T*N), which were prepared6 by a standard solid-state reaction method. Both samples were sintered at 1150degC for 10 h followed by annealing at 500 degC for 10 h in O2-gas flow and confirmed to be of single phase of the _T_*-type by x-ray powder diffraction. As the Zn content x increased, _Tc_ decreased monotonically.6 The _Tc_'s for the samples with x = 0 and 0.015 were 23.1 K and less than 2 K, respectively. For comparison, parallel measurements were made for a sintered sample 6 of La1.85Sr0.15CuO4-_d_ (_T_ phase: _Tc_ = 38.3 K).

The Seebeck coefficients were measured by a dc differential method at temperatures between 20 and 310 K. The temperature and temperature gradient across the sample were measured using a calibrated Si-diode sensor and two pairs of copper-Constantan thermocouples, respectively. The Cu wires of 50-_m_m diameter were used as the reference metal. The sample dimension was 7 x 2.5 x 1 mm3. The Hall-effect and resistivity measurements were simultaneously made under the same conditions as those employed in Ref. 5.

The Seebeck coefficient d for La1.85Sr0.15CuO4-_d_ is plotted in Fig. 1 with open circles. The _d_-_vs_-_T_ curve has a maximum around 90 K, as previously reported.2,7 Figure 1 also includes the data for the temperature dependence of d and resistivity (_r_) for the 4:4:6 samples. The _d_-_vs_-_T_ curve for Eu 4:4:6 (crosses in Fig. 1) has a peak (at T_{q}) around 170 K and is nearly identical with that for La1.85Sr0.15CuO4-_d_ at temperatures above 200 K. Throughout the measured temperature range, d for Y 4:4:6 (solid triangles in Fig. 1) is larger than that for Eu 4:4:6. T_{q} for Y 4:4:6 is 190 K, which is slightly higher than that for Eu 4:4:6. The resistivity of Y 4:4:6 is larger than that for Eu 4:4:6, especially at temperatures below 100 K. Each of the _r_-_vs_-_T_ curves possesses a minimum between 120-130 K. The Hall coefficients (R_{H}) of the  two samples were identical, within an uncertainty of +- 4%, at temperatures higher than 150 K (see Fig. 2 of Ref. [5]). R_{H} of these samples exhibited a broad peak with respect to temperature located around 110-130 K. [5]

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of d and r for the _T_* samples. The _d_-vs-_T_ curve for T*S (solid circles in Fig. 2) shows a maximum at _Tq_ = 160 K. When the Cu sites are substituted by Zn, the magnitude of d is raised throughout the measured temperature range, and _Tq_ shifts from 160 K to 210 K. At the same time, the magnitude of r is increased especially at temperatures lower than 150 K. Each of the _r_-vs-_T_ curves has a minimum at 110-130 K. The Hall coefficients for the T*N at temperatures higher than 150 K are nearly the same as those of the T*S as shown in Fig. 3. The temperature dependence of R_{H} for each of these samples exhibits a peak in the temperature range of 130-150 K, and, at temperatures lower than the peak temperature, the slope of the _R__H_-vs-_T_ curves decreases with decreasing T_{c}, as previously observed for the 4:4:6 samples. [5]

The _d_-vs-_T_ curves for the 4:4:6 (Fig. 1) and _T_* phases (Fig. 2) are slightly different from that for La1.85-Sr0.15CuO4-_δ_ (Fig. 1). The superconducting samples of both the 4:4:6 and _T_* phases, i.e., Eu 4:4:6 and T*S, show nearly identical _d_-vs-_T_ curves. For each of the two phases, the difference in d of the nonsuperconducting and superconducting samples (D_δ_) is plotted with respect to temperature in Fig. 4. The temperature dependence of D_δ_ for the 4:4:6 samples is similar to that for the _T_* samples. At low temperatures (below 150 K for the 4:4:6 phase and below 130 K for the _T_* phase), D_δ_ is independent of temperature. At high temperatures, D_δ_ increases with increasing temperature, although the data for temperatures above 260 K are rather scattered probably because of poor temperature control. Thus, the differences in _δ_, R_{H}, and r of the nonsuperconducting and superconducting samples seem to be qualitatively different in the high- and low-temperature ranges, being separated around 110-150 K. The experimental results for both the 4:4:6 and _T_* samples are summarized as follows: (1) In the high-temperature range--higher than 150 K--_R__H_ of the nonsuperconducting compound is nearly identical with that of the superconducting compound, and also the _r_'s of

  the two compounds are not very different; (2) in the same temperature range, however, \delta of the nonsuperconducting compound is larger than that of the superconducting compound; (3) in the low-temperature range lower than 150 K, the nonsuperconducting compound has larger \delta, R_{H}, and \rho than those of the superconducting compound.

It was reported [7] for (La, Ba)_{2}CuO_{4} and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} that, when the density of doped holes decreased, both \delta and R_{H} increased in the temperature range between T_{c} and 300 K. In the present work, result (2) may not be caused by a difference in the hole density but by a difference in the carrier-scattering contribution, because of result (1). On the other hand, in the low-temperature range, result (3) implies that the mobile-carrier concentrations of the nonsuperconducting and superconducting compounds are different. [5] Nonetheless, the relation between the high- and low-temperature transport properties is not clear.

So far it has been demonstrated that the difference in the transport properties between Y 4:4:6 and Eu 4:4:6 appears to be parallel to that between T*N and T*S, in spite of the fact that the nature of Eu(Y) atomic site in the 4:4:6 phase is different from that of Cu(Zn) atomic site in the _T*_ phase. Therefore, the dependence of T_{c} on the size of the L^{3+} ion in the 4:4:6 phase and the decrease in T_{c} by Zn doping in the _T*_ phase are suspected to have the same origin. The substitution of Zn for Cu in the _T*_ phase is expected to cause a deterioration in the antiferromagnetic correlations between Cu^{2+} spins [6] and a disorder (in the potential energy) in the CuO_{2} planes. These effects may bring about additional carrier scattering and/or a change in the energy dependence of the carrier mean free path, and consequently an increase in \delta. In the 4:4:6 phase, a similar disorder may be caused in the CuO_{2} planes by the change in the radius of the L^{3+} ion. Such a disorder may be induced by oxygen defects in the fluorite-type block in the crystal, and the mismatch in the lattice dimension between the CuO_{2} plane and the underlying fluorite-type block.

Recently, using a gauge-field theory for a uniform resonating-valence-band (RVB) state, Nagaosa and Lee [8] proposed that, for the superconducting cuprates, \delta = \delta_{F}, +\delta_{B} (NL model), where \delta_{F} and \delta_{B} were estimated -- using the Fermi statistics and Maxwellian statistics, respectively--to be -(k_{B}/e)k_{B}T/E_{F} and (k_{B}/e)11 -\ln(2\pi p_{\rm sh}/mk_{B}T). The p_{\rm sh} denotes concentration of holes on CuO_{2} sheets per [Cu-O]. In order to fit the present experimental data to this equation, m and E_{F} were regarded as fitting parameters. However, thus-fitted curves were not in reasonable agreement with the experimental data. An additional parameter F may be introduced as follows:

\[\delta(T)=(k_{B}/e)[1-F\ln(2\pi p_{\rm sh}G/T)-T/H]\ ,\] (1)

where F, G, and H are fitting parameters. Assuming p_{\rm sh} = 0.14 for all the samples and using a least-squares method, these three parameters were determined for each sample, as listed in Table 1. In the NL model, [8] the values for parameters G (\simm^{-1}) and H (\simE_{F}) are expected to be of the order of the exchange energy J \sim 1000 K. The values for G and H given in Table 1 are roughly of the same order as those anticipated by the NL model. The solid and dashed curves in the lower portion of Figs. 1 and 2 are the fitted curves using Eq. (1). These fitted curves, especially for Eu 4:4:6, T*S, and T samples, are in good agreement with the experimental curves. Therefore, if the temperature dependence of \delta is given by the relation: \delta = \delta_{F} + \delta_{B}, the logarithmic term in \delta_{B} is required to be modified by parameter F. This suggests that the chemical potential of the boson system is smaller (by a factor F \sim 0.3) than that of the Maxwell distribution in the two-dimensional system employed in the NL model. Equation (1) can explain the decrease in \delta with increasing temperature at room temperature and the maximum of \delta at 100-250 K that have been often observed for superconducting cuprates. [2] It should be noted, however, that the present \delta-vs-T curves at temperatures below 100 K show a linear behavior rather than the logarithmic behavior of Eq. (1). Alternative explanations for the discrepancy between the experimental results and the NL model can be made based on certain carrier-dragging effects by phonons, spins, and/or gauge field (photons).

In summary, the Seebeck coefficients for (L_{2/3}Ce_{1/3})_{4}(La_{1/3}Ba_{1/3}Sr_{1/3})_{4}CuO_{2} (L = Eu and Y) and Nd_{1/4}Ce_{0.2}Sr_{0.4}Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x}O_{4-\delta} (x = 0 and 0.015) were positive and had maxima around 160-210 K. For each of the 4:4:6 phase and the _T*_ phase in the high-temperature range (T > 150 K), R_{H} of the nonsuperconducting compound (i.e., Y 4:4:6 or T*S) was nearly the same as that of the superconducting compound, but \delta of the nonsuper

\begin{tabular}{c c c c} Sample & F & G (K) & H (K) \\ Eu 4:4:6 & 0.408\pm 0.011 & 352\pm 16 & 414\pm 11 \\ Y 4:4:6 & 0.333\pm 0.017 & 426\pm 43 & 575\pm 35 \\ T*S & 0.339\pm 0.017 & 529\pm 58 & 515\pm 28 \\ T*N & 0.307\pm 0.018 & 596\pm 79 & 798\pm 70 \\ T phase & 0.2422\pm 0.0013 & 58  conducting compound was larger than that of the superconducting compound. This suggests that the contribution from carrier scattering to d is different between the nonsuperconducting and superconducting compounds. In the low-temperature range (_T_ < 150 K), the nonsuperconducting compound had larger values not only for d but also for R_{H} and r than those of the superconducting compound. Further studies are required to determine the relation between the high-temperature (_T_ > 150 K) and low-temperature (_T_ < 150 K) transport properties.
