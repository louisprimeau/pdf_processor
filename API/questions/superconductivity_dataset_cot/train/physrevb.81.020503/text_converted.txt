###### Abstract

The symmetry of the superconducting (SC) order parameter is one of the
most important issues in iron pnictide superconductors.[1] NMR studies
on _R_FeAsO ("1111," R is a rare-earth element)[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14] and AFe₂As₂ superconductors ("122," A is an
alkaline-earth element)[10, 11, 12, 13, 14] have consistently found the
absence of a coherence peak, but T dependences of the spin-lattice
relaxation rate T₁⁻¹ below _T__(c) remain controversial. Although these
various behaviors of T₁⁻¹ below _T__(c) may reflect that T₁⁻¹ in iron
pnictides is sensitive to doping levels and/or sample quality, these NMR
results[15, 16, 17, 18, 19] show no evidence of a residual density of
states (DOS) at zero energy in the SC state.[15] This is in sharp
contrast to the case of high-_T__(c) cuprates, where dilute impurities
and crystalline defects easily induce a residual DOS at the Fermi level.

Recently, the penetration-depth study on the iron phosphide LaFePO
(_T__(c) 6 K) suggested nodal superconductivity,[16] which is
inconsistent with the prevailing theory of fully gapped _s__(±)
states.[17, 18, 19] This different SC state is shown to be explained by
changes in pnictogen height acting as a switch between high-_T__(c)
nodeless and low-_T__(c) nodal pairing.[20] In this regard, the
isovalent P-substituted BaFe2(As1_(s1−)P_(x))2 where P substitution is
expected to reduce the pnictogen height is interesting in order to
investigate the nature of the SC gap function. Isovalent P substitution
for As can tune the ground state of BaFe2As2 from antiferromagnetism to
superconductivity with a comparable maximum _T__(c) value of 30 K,
similar Fermi surfaces, and a similar phase diagram to
(Ba1_(s1−)K_(s))Fe2As2 (see Fig. 1).[21, 22] It is believed that P
substitution in BaFe2(As1_(s1−)P_(x))2 does not introduce charge
carriers, unlike the hole-doped (Ba1_(s1−)K_(s))Fe2As2 and
electron-doped Ba(Fe1_(s1−)Co_(s))2As2. Here, we present NMR evidence
for a residual DOS at zero energy in BaFe2(As0_(s0−)P_(s0−)33), which is
fundamentally different from other iron arsenide superconductors. Our
findings suggest that different SC pairing states are realized in iron
pnictides despite comparable high-_T__(c) values, analogous phase
diagrams, and similar Fermi surfaces.

Polycrystalline samples of BaFe2(As0.67P0.33)2, consisting of single
crystals with average dimensions of 100 x 100 x 50 μm3, were prepared
from mixtures of FeAs, Fe, P, and Ba.[22] The P substitution x was
determined by an energy dispersive x ray. ac-susceptibility measurements
with an NMR coil show that _T__(c)(_H_=0) is 30.0 K with a narrow
transition width, indicating an excellent sample quality (see Fig. 1).

The inset in Fig. 2 shows 31P NMR spectra obtained by sweeping frequency
at a fixed magnetic field (4.12 T). The Knight shift K was determined
with respect to a resonance line in H2PO4 (_K_=0 in Fig. 2). K is T
independent [_K_ = 0.131 +- 0.001]

The 31P (75As) nuclear-spin-lattice relaxation rate T₁⁻¹ was determined
by fitting the time dependence of the spin-echo intensity to a
theoretical _I_=1/2 (3/2) curve after a saturation pulse. Good fits are
obtained throughout the temperature range 100 mK-270 K (see Fig. 4),
indicating a homogeneous electronic state in BaFe2(As0.67P0.33)2. In
contrast to the _T_-independent Knight shift, (_T_1_)_T_⁻¹ for 31P and
75As increases significantly on cooling down to _T__(c) (see Fig. 3).
Since (_T_1_)_T_⁻¹ is related to the sum of _q_-averaged dynamic-cal
spin susceptibility χ(_q_ = 0), this (_T_1_)_T_⁻¹ result clearly shows
the development of low-lying spin fluctuations at finite wave vectors Q
away from zero.

Next, we compare spin dynamics in BaFe2(As0.67P0.33)2 with those in
(Ba0.6K0.4)Fe2As2, Ba(Fe0.92C00.08)2As2, LaFeAs(O0.89F0.11), and
LaFeAs0.6 superconductors, which are all near optimum doping. As in
BaFe2(As0.67P0.33)2, the development of low-energy AFM fluctuations is
inferred from an increase in (_T_1_)_T_⁻¹ in (Ba1_(s1−)K_(s))Fe2As2
(Refs. [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]) and Ba(Fe1_(s1−)Co_(s))2As2.[14, 24]
suggesting the importance of AFM fluctuations for superconductivity (see
Fig. 3). In contrast, low-lying AFM fluctuations are suppressed above
_T__(c) in optimally doped LaFeAs(O0.89F0.11) (Refs. [2] and [3]) and
LaFeAsO_(0.6)[5, 6] implying different nature of low-lying AFM
fluctuations in 122 and 111 superconductors. Interestingly, the T
dependences of (T₁T)⁻¹ differ even among the Ba122 superconductors;
(T₁T)⁻¹ in (Ba_(0.6)K_(0.4))Fe₂As₂ exhibits the most significant T
dependence, there is only a slight enhancement below about 50 K in
Ba(Fe_(0.92)Co_(0.08))₂As₂, and an intermediate T dependence of (T₁T)⁻¹
is observed in BaFe₂(As_(0.65)P_(0.33))₂. These variations indicate that
low-lying AFM fluctuations are sensitive to composition, and this is
attributable to different nesting conditions in their Fermi surfaces
[22, 25]. Although these materials have similar Fermi surfaces with
three hole sheets and two electron sheets, band calculations suggest
that P and K substitutions would modify their Fermi surfaces in
different ways [22, 25]; P substitution makes the hole sheets having
stronger c-axis warping, and thus nesting is only possible in restricted
regions along the c direction, while K doping makes the hole sheets
larger and the electron sheets smaller, resulting in only one electron
and hole sheet among five contributing to the nesting.

Figure 3 highlights systematic variations in (T₁T)⁻¹ from hole- to
electron-doped arsenides. The large values of (T₁T)⁻¹ in the hole-doped
(Ba_(0.6)K_(0.4))Fe₂As₂ at high temperatures most likely originate from
the enhanced DOS at the Fermi level inferred from band calculations
[25]. In contrast, in the electron-doped Ba(Fe_(0.92)Co_(0.08))₂As₂,
LaFeAs(O_(0.85)P_(0.11)), and LaFeAsO_(0.6), (T₁T)⁻¹ is smaller and
decreases on cooling at high temperatures. This is attributable to a
hole Fermi surface with a high DOS just below the Fermi level [26].
Thus, the variations in T dependences of (T₁T)⁻¹ suggest that spin
dynamics probed by NMR are strongly related to the nature of the Fermi
surfaces.

In the SC state of BaFe₂(As_(0.65)P_(0.33))₂, we observed a marked T₁⁻¹
behavior distinctly different from other iron arsenides. Figure 4(c)
shows that ³¹P T₁⁻¹ decreases sharply just below T_(c) and there is no
evidence for a coherence peak. We find T₁⁻¹≪T below ∼∼4 K down to 100
mK, showing the existence of a residual DOS at zero energy. Below about
10 K (∼0.3T_(c)), T₁⁻¹ depends on the magnetic field [see Fig. 4(c)]. By
extrapolating to zero field, we still find T₁T =const behavior below ∼4
K, excluding the possibility that the T₁T=const behavior is attributable
to applied fields. The existence of a residual DOS in H→0 inferred from
NMR is consistent with thermal-conductivity results on
BaFe₂(As_(0.65)P_(0.33))₂ that reveal a finite thermal conductivity
divided by temperature κ₀/T at T→0 under zero field [25]. Our findings
may also be related to the recent specific-heat results on
Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂[27].

There are two possible contributions to the field dependence of T₁⁻¹
arising from quasiparticle excitations in the mixed state: localized
quasiparticles inside vortex cores and

-delocalized quasiparticles originating from nodes in the SC gap. Since
the applied fields are much smaller than H_(c2) = 52 T,[25] localized
quasiparticles inside vortex cores are unlikely to contribute to the
relaxation at these fields (H/H_(c2)≈ 0.22). In fact, the
thermal-conductivity measurements also show a sizable field dependence
of κ₀(H)/T at low fields, attaining nearly 70

The existence of a residual DOS in the SC state of
BaFe₂(As_(0.67)P_(0.33))₂ differs strikingly from other iron arsenides,
including 1111 (Refs. 2-9) and 122 superconductors,[10; 11; 28; 12]
instead resembling the cuprates and heavy fermion superconductors, which
have nodes in their SC gap. As shown in Fig. 5, ⁵⁷Fe T₁⁻¹ in
(Ba_(0.6)K_(0.4))Fe₂As₂ near optimal doping exhibits a T⁵-like
dependence well below T_(c).[12] The fairly large exponent of ∼5 in T₁⁻¹
implies a fully gapped state in (Ba_(0.6)K_(0.4))Fe₂As₂, and was
analyzed in terms of s_(z)-wave superconductivity with two gaps.[12] In
the s_(z) models with unitary scatterings,[29; 30] in-gap states at zero
energy can be induced without severely reducing T_(c) and can in
principle account for the T₁⁻¹∝T behavior. However, the penetration
depth Δ(T)∝T at low temperatures observed in BaFe₂(As_(0.67)P_(0.33))₂
is incompatible with these models,[31; 32] but is consistent with line
nodes in the gap.[25] In a symmetry-imposed nodal superconductor such as
described by a line-node model Δ=Δ₀sin (2ϕ), T₁⁻¹∝T³ in the clean limit,
but impurity scattering induced near gap nodes gives rise to an enhanced
T₁⁻¹ that is proportional to temperature at low temperatures.[133] P
dopants in BaFe₂(As_(0.67)P_(0.33))₂ can provide a source for
nonmagnetic scatterers, consistent with the existence of Fermi-level
DOS. In fact, the T₁⁻¹ data of BaFe₂(As_(0.67)P_(0.33))₂ are well fit by
the line-node model with Δ₀/T_(c)=6 and $N_{\rm res}$/N₀=0.34, where
$N_{\rm res}$/N₀ is the ratio of a residual DOS in the SC state to that
in the normal state (see Fig. 5). Therefore, NMR, penetration-depth, and
thermal-conductivity results on BaFe₂(As_(0.67)P_(0.33))₂ are consistent
with the existence of line nodes in the SC gap.

In the case of nodes imposed by symmetry, a residual DOS at zero energy
is a natural consequence of the impurity scattering that broadens the
nodes. However, this is not clear for the case of "accidental" nodes not
imposed by symmetry, as in the extended s-wave case because impurity
scattering will lift the nodes and produce a more isotropic gap.[34] Our
experimental findings impose significant constraints on candidate
theoretical descriptions of iron pnictide superconductivity.

The strikingly different behavior of T₁⁻¹ in the SC state between
BaFe₂(As_(0.67)P_(0.33))₂ and (Ba_(0.6)K_(0.4))Fe₂As₂ is surprising
because they have comparable T_(c) values and similar Fermi surfaces.
This implies that high-T_(c) superconductivities with and without nodes
are nearly degenerate and that subtle differences can significantly
modify the nature of superconductivity.[18; 23; 34; 35; 36] Changes in
the pnictogen height may lead to nodal superconductivity, but its T_(c)
should be much lower than that of fully gapped s_(z) states.[20]
However, this is not the case in BaFe₂(As_(0.67)P_(0.33))₂. One notable
difference inferred from band calculations[22; 25] is that

Figure 4: (Color online) (a) and (b) show ³¹P nuclear-spin relaxation
curves for 175 and 1.5 K in 4.12 T, exhibiting clear single exponential
behavior. (c) ³¹P T₁⁻¹ under 2.1, 4.12, and 6.0 T. Inset in (c) shows
³¹P T₁⁻¹ vs magnetic field at 2 K; a linear fit is used to extrapolate
T₁⁻¹ for H→ 0 T.

BaFe₂(As_(0.65)P_(0.33))₂ may be more three dimensional than
(Ba_(0.65)K_(0.4))Fe₂As₂, suggesting that a three-dimensional model is
required. Reconciling their comparable T_(c) values and fundamentally
different SC gap functions needs further theoretical and experimental
works. To clarify this problem, identifying the nodes’ location on Fermi
surfaces will be crucial.

In conclusion, our NMR results show the existence of a residual DOS at
zero energy in BaFe₂(As_(0.65)P_(0.33))₂. This is consistent with the
presence of nodes in the SC gap inferred from a field dependence of T₁⁻¹
and from thermal-conductivity and penetration-depth results. Our results
suggest that strikingly different SC gaps appear in iron pnictides
despite comparable high-T_(c) values, analogous phase diagrams, and
similar Fermi surfaces.
