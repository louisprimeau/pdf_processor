###### Abstract

Muon spin rotation (μSR) and ¹⁹F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
measurements were performed to investigate the effect of Mn for Fe
substitutions in La_(1 − y)Y_(y)Fe_(1 − x)Mn_(x)AsO_(0.89)F_(0.11)
superconductors. While for y = 0 a very low critical concentration of Mn
(x = 0.2%) is needed to quench superconductivity, as y increases the
negative chemical pressure introduced by Y for L substitution stabilizes
superconductivity and for y = 20% it is suppressed at Mn contents an
order of magnitude larger. A magnetic phase arises once
superconductivity is suppressed both for y = 0 and for y = 20%.
Low-energy spin fluctuations give rise to a peak in ¹⁹F NMR 1/T₁ with an
onset well above the superconducting transition temperature and whose
magnitude increases with x. Also the static magnetic correlations probed
by ¹⁹F NMR linewidth measurements show a marked increase with Mn
content. The disruption of superconductivity and the onset of the
magnetic ground state are discussed in the light of the proximity of
LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) to a quantum critical point.

## I Introduction

The introduction of impurities in superconductors is a well known
approach to probe the local response function and to unravel their
intrinsic microscopic properties [1]. Both spinless and paramagnetic
impurities perturb the local electronic environment and cause a
significant change in the spin polarization around them. When the spin
correlations are particularly enhanced, as is the case the proximity of
a quantum critical point (QCP) [2, 3], or when the amount of impurities
starts to be significant, cooperative effects become relevant and marked
changes in the superconducting transition temperature are observed,
eventually leading to the appearance of a magnetic order [4]. In the
pnictides extensive studies on the effect of impurities on the
superconducting ground state have been reported [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and
the most dramatic and yet not fully understood effect is induced by Mn
for Fe substitution in the optimally electron-doped
LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11)[11]. In this material it is sufficient to
introduce a tiny amount of paramagnetic Mn impurities, as low as 0.2

In this paper we present a study of the effect of Mn doping in
LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) where La is partially substituted by Y, for
doping levels up to 20

## II Experimental methods and results

Two series of polycrystalline
La_(1 − y)Y_(y)Fe_(1 − x)Mn_(x)AsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) samples have been
studied: the first one with fixed y = 20% yttrium content (LaY20
hereafter) and nominal Mn contents ranging from x = 0% to 20

The intensity of the ¹⁹F NMR signal was measured at room temperature in
order to check the effective fluorine content both for the LaY20 and for
the LaYMn05 series. The results, reported in Fig. 1 show that the
absolute fluorine stoichiometry is constant in each sample series within
±0.5%.

### Muon spin relaxation results

In a muon spin relaxation (μSR) experiment 100

In order to probe the local magnetic properties of
La_(1 − y)Y_(y)Fe_(1 − x)Mn_(x)AsO_(0.89)F_(0.11), zero field (ZF) and
longitudinal field (LF) measurements were carried out at the Paul
Sherrer Institut (PSI) with the Dolly instrument of SμS facility. ZF
measurements are extremely sensitive to spontaneous magnetism since in
this configuration the local field at the muon site originates from the
internal magnetic order only. On the other hand, LF measurements
represent a useful tool to study the spin dynamics and can conveniently
be used to distinguish between static and dynamic magnetism [20,21].

Figure 2 shows the typical time dependence of the ZF μSR asymmetry at
different temperatures for the samples that display a magnetic order
below T_(m). The time evolution of the muon asymmetry could be fit with
the following standard function:

A(t) = A₀[f₁e^(−λ₁t) + f_(⊥)G(t, B_(μ))],
(1)

where A₀ is the initial μSR asymmetry, while f₁ and f_(⊥) are the
longitudinal (B_(μ) ∥ S_(μ)) and transverse (B_(μ) ⊥ S_(μ)) fractions of
the asymmetry, respectively. The function G(t, B_(μ)) = exp (−λ_(⊥)t)
determines the time dependence of the transverse component, whereas the
longitudinal one decays exponentially with a decay rate λ_(∥).

At high temperature (T > 30 K) the samples of the LaY20 and LaYMn05
series are in the paramagnetic regime and the muon asymmetry can be fit
by setting f_(⊥) = 0, with decay rates λ_(∥) ∼ 0.09μs⁻¹. Upon decreasing
the temperature a fast decaying component f_(⊥) emerges in the LaY20
samples with x ≥ 10%, evidencing the presence of overdamped oscillations
in the muon asymmetry. A similar behavior is observed for samples close
to the magnetic superconducting boundary [22,23] and reflects the
presence of a significant distribution of local magnetic fields,
typically observed when a short range AF magnetic order develops [22].
The size of the internal fields is of the order of the field
distribution ΔB_(μ), which can be roughly estimated as
Δ B_(μ) = λ_(⊥)/γ_(μ). The values of Δ B_(μ) obtained from the fit of
the data with Eq. (1), of the order of 10 mT, are shown in Fig. 3(a).
The static character of the magnetism developing at T < T_(m) has been
confirmed by LF μSR experiment which have shown that a field of about
100 mT is enough to completely recover the initial muon asymmetry at 2
K. At variance, all LaY20 samples with x < 6% and all the samples of the
LYaMnO5 series do not display a spontaneous magnetic order down to 2 K.

mass, at room temperature for selected LaY20 and LaYMn05 samples (see
legend).

Figure 2: (a) Zero field μSR signal for the
La_(0.89)Y_(0.25)F_(1 − x)Mn_(x)AsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) sample with x = 20%,
measured at different temperatures. (b) ZF μSR signal for LaY20 samples
with x = 6%, 10

The sample magnetic volume fraction V_(m), namely the fraction of the
sample volume where the muons sense the magnetic order, can be derived
from f_(∥). From simple geometric arguments [20,21] it can be shown that
in a polycrystalline sample with 100

$$V_{m}(T)=\frac{1}{2}\bigg{(}1-\text{erf}\bigg{(}\frac{T-T_{m}}{\sqrt{2}\Delta T _{m}}\bigg{)}\bigg{)}$$
(2)

which assumes the presence of a Gaussian distribution of local
transition temperatures centered around the average value T_(m). The
results are reported in the phase diagram in Fig. 7.

### Nuclear magnetic resonance results

¹⁹F NMR experiments were performed on LaY20 samples in order to complete
the study reported in Ref. [18]. The Y for La substitution results in a
system with higher chemical pressure with respect to La1111 (La³⁺ and
Y³⁺ ionic radii are 103 pm and 90 pm, respectively), without introducing
paramagnetic lanthanide ions, such as Sm³⁺, which would significantly
affect the ¹⁹F spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T₁) [24].

The polycrystalline samples were milled to fine powders in order to
improve the radiofrequency penetration. All the measurements were
performed in a magnetic field of 1.36 T, in the temperature range
between 4 K and 100 K. For a few selected samples the temperature range
was extended up to 200 K to precisely estimate the high temperature ¹⁹F
1/T₁ trend.

The ¹⁹F spin lattice relaxation rate was estimated by fitting the
recovery of the longitudinal magnetization M_(z)(τ) after a saturation
recovery pulse sequence
($\frac{\pi}{2}-\tau-\frac{\pi}{2}-\tau_{\text{echo}}-\pi$). For all the
samples the recovery could be nicely fit to a stretched exponential (see
Fig. 4):

M_(z)(τ) = M₀[1 − e^(−(τ/T₁)^(d))],
(3)

with M₀ the nuclear magnetization at thermal equilibrium and β the
stretching exponent.

The stretching exponent progressively decreased on cooling below 100 K,
and it was found in the range 0.5 ≤ β ≤ 1 for all samples (see the inset
to Fig. 4). This behavior indicates the presence of a distribution of
spin lattice relaxation times which is a common feature of disordered
systems, and in our case it is probably due to the different
inequivalent impurity configurations resulting from Y and Mn doping. In
fact, the low temperature values of β get smaller on increasing the Mn
content, namely the number of impurities.

Measurements in a lower field of 0.75 T revealed that while at high
temperature 1/T₁ is only weakly field dependent, the magnitude of the
peak at 25 K is significantly enhanced [18], which is exactly the
behavior expected for slow dynamics with a characteristic frequency in
the MHz range, close to the Larmor frequency ω₀.

The behavior of 1/T₁ below 25 K depends on the Mn doping level: In
samples with Mn doping below 10

Further insights on the effects of Mn doping can be gained from the
study of the temperature dependence of the ¹⁹F NMR linewidth Δv,
directly related to the amplitude of the staggered magnetization
developing around the Mn impurity [10a]. Δv was derived from the fast
Fourier transform of half of the echo signal after a Hahn spin-echo
pulse sequence. As can be seen in Fig. 6, by increasing the Mn content a
marked increase of Δv is observed. The data reported were fitted with a
Curie-Weiss law Δv = (Δv)₀ + C/(T + Θ) (see solid lines in Fig. 6). The
temperature independent term Δv₀ ∼ 14 kHz estimated from the fit of the
data up to T = 300 K is in very good agreement with the value 13.5 kHz
estimated for the nuclear dipole-dipole interaction derived from lattice
sums. About 80

## III Discussion

The phase diagram of LaY20, and for comparison that of LaY0 [11],
derived from SQUID magnetization and μSR measurements, are shown in Fig.

Figure 6: ¹⁹F NMR full width at half intensity for three representative
samples of the LaY20 series. Solid lines are best fits according to a
Curie-Weiss law while the arrows indicate T_(c) of the x = 1

content. These data show that the substitution of La with Y causes a
sizable increase of the critical Mn threshold x_(c) required to suppress
superconductivity, with an increase from 0.2

When superconductivity is fully suppressed a magnetic order arises both
in the LaY0 and in the LaY20 series, as shown in Fig. 7. This behavior
suggests that the two orders are competing and that for LaY0 a quantum
critical point is separating the superconducting and magnetic phases, as
supported by the previous [11] analysis of the temperature dependence of
the magnetic correlation length. On the other hand, it should be pointed
out that for LaY20 a crossover region where both T_(c) and T_(m) are
zero is observed for 4

The onset of a magnetic order for just 0.2

The chemical pressure induced by Y doping causes an increase in the
metallic character since the hopping integral t is enhanced by shrinking
the cell. It is clear that when the system becomes more metallic an
increased screening of the Coulomb potential is expected and hence also
U should be effectively reduced resulting in a decrease in U/t with
increasing Y content. Accordingly, the spin polarization around the Mn
impurity is reduced and larger Mn contents are needed to induce a
magnetic order which, in any case, appears to be characterized by an
order parameter which is weaker than that observed in the LaY0 system
(Fig. 7). However, the behavior of the LaY0 and LaY20 series becomes
similar (see the inset of Fig. 8) once the phase diagram is rescaled by
the critical Mn content x_(c) and the superconducting transition
temperature for T_(c)(x = 0). Namely the Mn doping level x_(c) yielding
the quantum critical point is renormalized by the decrease in U/t.

Further insights on the effect of Mn in LaY0 and LaY20 can be derived
from the analysis of the ¹⁹F NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate. As it is
shown in Fig. 5 a broad peak in 1/T₁, which is increasing with the Mn
content, is detected around 25 K. That peak, observed both in the LaY0
and in the LaY20 series, is a very general feature of these systems
since it is present both in superconducting and magnetic samples and
also in the sample without Mn doping [18, 27], although slightly shifted
to lower temperatures. The introduction of increasing Mn contents gives
rise to a progressive enhancement of the peak magnitude, suggesting that
the presence of paramagnetic impurities strengthens the low-frequency
dynamics already present in the pure compound. Its dependence on the
magnetic field intensity [18] indicates that it has to be associated
with low-frequency fluctuations (MHz range). This peak should not be
ascribed to the slowing down of the critical fluctuations on approaching
T_(m), which are present only in the magnetic samples and give rise to a
steeper increase in 1/T₁ only at lower temperatures (Fig. 5).

The approach devised by Bloembergen-Purcell-Pound [28] (BPP model) is
often suited to describe 1/T₁ in the presence of hyperfine field h⃗(t)
fluctuations approaching the Larmor frequency ω₀, namely in the MHz
range. The model assumes that the autocorrelation function for the field
fluctuations decays exponentially:

⟨h_(⊥)(t + τ)h_(⊥)(t)⟩ = ⟨h_(⊥)²⟩e^(−t/x_(c)),
(4)

Figure 8: Critical temperatures for the LaYMnO5 samples studied in this
paper. The dashed line is a guide to the eye. Inset:
T_(c)(x)/T_(c)(x = 0) versus the Mn content normalized by the critical
content causing the vanishing of T_(c) for LaY20 and LaY0 (Ref. [11])
series (see text).

where τ_(c) is the characteristic time of the fluctuations and h_(⊥) is
the component of the local fluctuating hyperfine field perpendicular to
H⃗₀, with ⟨h_(⊥)²⟩ its mean square amplitude. The spin lattice relaxation
rate, which probes the spectral density at ω₀, then takes the form:

$$\frac{1}{T_{1}}=\gamma^{2}\langle h_{\perp}^{2}\rangle\frac{\tau_{c}(T)}{1+ \omega_{0}^{2}\tau_{c}(T)^{2}},$$
(5)

where γ is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio. In many disordered systems,
including cuprates [29], τ_(c)(T) is described by a thermally activated
law τ_(c)(T) = τ₀exp (E_(a)/T), where E_(a) is the energy barrier and τ₀
the correlation time at infinite temperature. However, monodisperse
fluctuations cannot explain the broad peaks observed in Mn doped
compounds. A much better result can be obtained by considering a
distribution of energy barriers, and thus of correlation times,
associated with the irregular distribution of Mn impurities.

For simplicity, the energy barrier distribution was taken as squared,
centered around E_(a) and with a width Δ. Accordingly Eq. (5) takes the
form [30]:

$$\frac{1}{T_{1}} = \frac{\gamma^{2}\langle h_{\perp}^{2}\rangle T}{2\omega_{0}\Delta} \Gamma[\arctan(\omega_{0}\tau_{0}e^{i(E_{a})+\Delta)/T})$$
(6)
−arctan (ω₀τ₀e^(i(E_(a)) − Δ)/T))] + cT,

where a linear Korringa-like term cT was added to account for the high
temperature behavior. Equation (6) was used to fit the 1/T₁ data for all
samples with Mn contents lower than 8

The fit parameters shown in Fig. 9 evidence that the mean value of the
energy barrier E_(a) is nearly constant as a function of Mn and that the
variation of the correlation time τ₀ of the spin fluctuations is small,
in the range of 0.1-0.4 ns. In the LaY0 series Δ increases with x
suggesting that the Mn leads to a distribution of activation energies
which reflects a strong inhomogeneous electronic environment, even at
very small Mn doping levels. For the LaY20 system this distribution is
nearly constant and affected by the disorder induced by the large amount
of Y introduced in the system. The most significant change is the
increase in the amplitude of the local fluctuating field
(⟨h_(⊥)²⟩)^(1/2) with x, which indicates that the strength of the local
spin susceptibility in the FeAs plane becomes progressively enhanced by
Mn doping. The enhancement of the local spin susceptibility is further
supported by the analysis of the temperature dependence of the ¹⁹F NMR
linewidth (Fig. 6), which is directly related to the amplitude of the
staggered magnetization developing around the impurity. The results,
summarized in Table. 1, show that both the Curie constant and the
Curie-Weiss temperature increase as a function of Mn, indicating that
the insertion of Mn strengthens the spin correlations.

The origin of the low-energy fluctuations giving rise to the peak in ¹⁹F
NMR 1/T₁ is not yet clear. They seem to be intrinsic to the system since
they are detected also for the LaY20 compound without manganese.
Furthermore the related activation energies E_(a) and correlation time
τ₀ are almost insensitive to the Mn content indicating that the
low-frequency dynamics is nearly unaltered when approaching the
disruption of superconductivity. Bumps in the 1/T₁ vs T behavior have
also been detected in other optimally electron-doped iron-based
superconductors [27; 33; 34; 35] in the same T range where the peak in
¹⁹F NMR 1/T₁ arises in Fig. 5. They have been tentatively associated
with nematic fluctuations [34] or with the motion of domain walls
separating nematic phases [35]. In this scenario the energy barrier
E_(a) may be related to the one separating the degenerate nematic phases
[36], and the enhancement of the low-frequency dynamics could be
associated with the pinning of those fluctuations by impurities. These
dynamics do not seem to be involved in the superconducting mechanism
since they survive well above the critical threshold x_(c) for the
suppression of T_(c).

axes). Top panel: mean value of the local fluctuating magnetic field

## IV Conclusions

We have shown that Y for La substitution in the optimally electron doped
LaFe_(1 − x)Mn_(x)AsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) superconductor leads to a shift in
the QCP driven by Mn to doping levels much higher than the ones detected
in the series without Y. This shift is associated with an increase in
the chemical pressure which causes a decrease in the electronic
correlations by Y doping, namely in the ratio U/t. Both in the LaY0 and
LaY20 series Mn is observed to enhance low-frequency fluctuations in the
MHz range which are already present in the normal phase of the Mn and Y
free superconductor. These low energy fluctuations are signaled by a
peak in 1/T₁ which is observed in different families of iron-based
superconductors and whose origin still has to be clarified.
