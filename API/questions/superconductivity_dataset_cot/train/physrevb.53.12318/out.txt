###### Abstract

The effects of doping and pressure on the superconducting transition temperature (_T_{c}_) of Lu(Ni_{1-x}_A_{x}_)BC with A = Cu and V have been investigated. _T_{c}_ was found to increase with Cu doping, but decrease with V doping, and pressure was observed to suppress all samples, doped or undoped, examined at a constant rate of \sim\!-0.17\!\pm\!0.3 K/GPa. The observations are not consistent with the predicted Fermi surface of LuNiBC residing at a density-of-states peak, and the pressure effect on _T_{c}_ cannot be understood in terms of shift in the Fermi surface alone. [SO163-1829(96)02118-2]

The discovery of superconductivity in a new family of boro-carbide intermetallic compounds, _L_-Ni-B-C, has generated considerable interests recently,[1] where L is Y or lanthanide elements (Ho, Er, Tm, Tb, and Lu). _T_{c}_ was found to be 16.6 K for the quaternary compound LuNi_{2}B_{2}C,[1] which may be viewed as a stacking of Ni_{2}B_{2} and LuC layers.[2] A closely related compound LuNiBC, which can be derived form LuNi_{2}B_{2}C by inserting another LuC layer between two adjacent Ni_{2}B_{2} blocks, is also a superconductor.[3] However, its _T_{c}_ is only 2.9 K (Ref. 3) despite the fact that the corresponding bond distances and bond angles are almost the same in these two compounds. The difference in _T_{c}_ has been interpreted based on the different densities of states _N_(_E_) at the Fermi level _E_{F}_ for the two compounds.[4; 5; 6] According to band-structure calculations,[4; 5; 6] these two compounds have a similar general feature in _N_(_E_): most states located a few eV below or above the Fermi level (_E_{F}_), except a few bands within 0.5 eV around _E_{F}_, resulting in an _N_(_E_) minimum just below an _N_(_E_) peak in this energy region. However, the subtle structural difference between the two compounds causes the _E_{F}_ of LuNi_{2}B_{2}C to reside at the _N_(_E_) peak whereas the _E_{F}_ of LuNiBC to situate at the _N_(_E_) minimum just below the corresponding LuNi_{2}B_{2}C peak. In the framework of BCS theory, the higher _T_{c}_ of LuNi_{2}B_{2}C can therefore be understood in terms of its higher _N_(_E_) ~4.8 states/(eV cell). The low _T_{c}_ of LuNiBC is then ascribed to the low _N_(_E_) of the compound. It was suggested that the _T_{c}_ of LuNiBC could be substantially enhanced by raising _E_{F}_ (by about 1 electron/cell) through substitutional doping, assuming that _N_(_E_{F}_) is the dominant change during the substitution.

In order to test these propositions, we measured the effects of both doping and pressure on the _T_{c}_ of LuNiBC. Cu(3d104s1) and V(3d3_d_3s2), which are on opposite sides of Ni (3d3_d_3s2) in the periodic table, were used to increase and decrease the conduction electrons of LuNiBC in our doping study. According to the band calculations, _T_{c}_ should increase in both cases if the Fermi level of LuNiBC lies at an _N_(_E_) minimum, in the rigid-band approximation. For the same reason, pressure is expected to suppress the _T_{c}_ of V-doped LuNiBC and enhance the _T_{c}_ of Cu-doped samples, provided that the pressure effect is dominated by the rise of conduction electron density as in most cases. As to the undoped LuNiBC, _T_{c}_ should increase with pressure due to a pressure-induced _N_(_E_{F}_) increase associated with either a band broadening or an _E_{F}_ shift. Unfortunately, contrary to above predictions, we observed that the _T_{c}_ of LuNiBCincreases with Cu doping, but decreases with V doping, and that pressure reduces the _T_{c}_ at a rate of \sim\!-0.17\!\pm\!0.3 K/GPa for all doped and undoped samples investigated. The observations suggest that the Fermi level may situate away from the _N_(_E_) minimum, instead of at the _N_(_E_) minimum as predicted. The negative pressure effect on _T_{c}_ observed in all samples examined shows that pressure influences not just the electron concentration, but also other factors, such as the electron-phonon coupling.

All samples in this investigation were prepared from high-purity elements (Lu 99.9%, Ni 99.8%, B 99.999%, C 99.9%, and V 99.5%) by arc-melting stoichiometric mixtures in a water-cooled Cu sheath under an argon atmosphere. The buttons were turned over at least 4 times between melts to promote homogeneity. The total weight loss due to arc melting was less than 1%. X-ray powder diffraction was performed by a Rigaku D-MAX III diffractometer. The _T_{c}_ was measured using the standard four-lead method on bar-shaped samples cut from arc-melted buttons. The hydrostatic pressure environment for the electrical measurements was generated by a modified self-clamp technique,[7] using 3M Fluorinert as the pressure medium. The applied pressure was changed at room temperature after each run. A Pb manometer situated next to the sample was used to determine the pressure and a Ge thermometer the temperature.

The phase purity of the samples was checked by x-ray powder diffraction. Layered LuNiBC was the major phase (>95%) in the undoped samples [Fig. 1(a)]. Both the Lu(Ni_{1-x}Cu_{x})BC and Lu(Ni_{1-x}V_{x})BC samples were nearly single phase with _x_<0.25 [Fig. 1(b)]. With _x_\approx0.25, excessive impurities appeared, suggesting the solubility limit of Cu/V in LuNiBC was \sim0.25.

Typical temperature dependences of the resistivity \rho are shown in Fig. 2 for Lu-Ni-B-C, Lu(Ni_{0.8}V_{0.2})BC, and Lu(Ni_{0.8}Cu_{0.2})BC, displaying a superconducting transition with a width varying between 0.2 and 0.4 K. The corresponding onset transition temperatures (_T_{c}_) are 2.96, 2.60, and 3.38 K, respectively. Cu doping results in an enhancement of _T_{c}_ at a relative rate of _d_ln _T_{c}_/_dx_\sim0.5, while V doping leads to a _T_{c}_ decrease at a rate of d ln _T_{c}_/_dx_\sim_-0.5, as shown in Fig. 3. Since the substitutional replacement of Ni by Cu increases the conducting electron concentration and upshifts E_{F} toward the N(E) peak, the enhanced T_{c} of LuNiBC by Cu doping is consistent with the band calculations within the framework of the rigid-band model. Unfortunately, V doping, which is supposed to down shift E_{F} away from the N(E) minimum and suppress the T_{c}, is in contrast to predictions. The results imply that the E_{F} of LuNiBC may be located between the N(E) minimum and the N(E) peak with a dN(E)/dE>0.

To gain further insight into the above observations, the normal-state \rho(T)'s of these samples were compared (Fig. 2, inset). The resistivity of all our samples depends on T linearly between 120 and 300 K with the similar relative slope (d\rho/dT)/\rho(300 K)\sim0.0018\pm0.0002/K, independent of doping. Therefore, one might tentatively attribute the doping effect of \rho to the change of N(E), by assuming \rho\approx 1/N(E_{F}). The observed \rho nearly doubled with either 0.1 Cu or 0.1 V doping (Fig. 2, inset). The drastic increase of \rho with both Cu and V doping combined with the observed T_{c} decreases with V doping cannot simply reconcile with either the prediction that the E_{F} of LuNiBC locates at a local N(E) valley by band calculations or even the conjecture that E_{F} may reside on the side of the N(E) valley with dN(E)/dE>0 implied by the doping effect. However, it should be noted that \rho is rather sensitive to various scattering processes and the assumption of \rho\approx 1/N(E_{F}) should be taken with caution.

The pressure effects on T_{c} and \rho of the undoped and doped samples have been measured up to 1.5 GPa. The resistive superconducting transition shifted parallel downward under pressure for all the samples as exemplified by Lu(Ni_{0.8}Cu_{0.2})BC in Fig. 4. dT_{c}/dP's are negative and have roughly the same value of -0.17\pm0.3 K/GPa for all the undoped, Cu-doped, and V-doped LuNiBC, as summarized in Fig. 5. Pressure usually can be regarded as either to

  shift the E_{F} upward or broaden the bands slightly in the rigid-band model. In either case, dT_{c}/dP should be positive for undoped LuNiBC if the E_{F} lies at a local N(E) minimum and T_{c} is dominated by N(E_{F}). The observed negative dT_{c}/dP of LuNiBC was not what was expected. Similarly, the dT_{c}/dP of Lu(Ni_{1-x}V_{x})BC and that of Lu(Ni_{1-x}Cu_{x})BC should either have different signs, if the E_{F} shift dominates the pressure effect, or be smaller than the dT_{c}/dP of LuNiBC, if band broadening is the main factor. The observed nearly constant negative pressure effect suggests that the real situation may be rather complicated and the change of T_{c} under pressure may not be interpreted in terms of an N(E_{F}) change alone.

Figure 6 shows that the normal-state resistivity decreases with pressure for the undoped LuNiBC, but is essentially unaffected by pressure for all the doped samples. This again demonstrates the complication of the pressure effect.

In conclusion, T_{c} and \rho(T) have been measured in undoped, Cu-doped, and V-doped LuNiBC at ambient and hydrostatic pressures. T_{c} increases with Cu doping, but decreases with V doping. Under pressure, a nearly constant dT_{c}/dP was observed for all examined compounds. Our results are not consistent with the prediction that the E_{F} of LuNiBC lies at a local N(E) minimum and suggests that the pressure effect cannot be interpreted in terms of the pressure-induced N(E_{F}) change alone in these compounds.
