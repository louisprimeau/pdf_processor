###### Abstract

Here, we report a combined study of transport and thermodynamic measurements on the layered pnictide material SrAg4As2. Upon cooling, a drop in electrical and Hall resistivity, a jump in heat capacity, and an increase in susceptibility and magnetoresistance are observed around 110 K. All suggest nonmagnetic phase transitions emerge at around 110 K, likely associated with structural distortions. In sharp contrast with the first-principles calculations based on the crystal structure at room temperature, quantum oscillations reveal small Fermi pockets with light effective masses, suggesting significant change in the Fermi surface topology caused by the low-temperature structural distortion. No superconductivity emerges in SrAg4As2 down to 2 K under pressures up to 2.13 GPa; instead, the low-temperature structural distortion moves up linearly to high temperature at a rate of \approx13 K/GPa above 0.89 GPa.

## I Introduction

Quasi-low-dimensional materials have attracted immense research interest because they often host exotic ground states due to strong quantum and thermal fluctuations. Layered pnictide materials have provided a rich platform to explore these ground states and the competitions among them. For example, the Fermi surface nesting leads to electronic/magnetic instabilities, resulting in spin-density-wave (SDW) state in Fe pnictide superconductors [1,2] and the charge-density wave (CDW) in RAgSb2 family [3,4]. For the former, the SDW order competes with the superconductivity and quantum critical behavior was argued in P-doped BaFe2As2 family [5]. For the latter, the CDW opens a gap at the Dirac point, leading to the exotic properties [6]. Among the layered pnictide, the ones containing AgAs have shown rich structural varieties, such as BaAg2As2 [7] as well the derivatives of the HfCuSi2 structure [8]. In this paper, we focus on the layered ternary pnictide SrAg4As2, which crystallizes in the centrosymmetric trigonal space group R\bar{3}m[9], as shown in the right inset of Fig. 1(a). It can be taken as ordered SrAg2As2 mixed with itinerant Ag layers, where Ag atoms (light blue balls) in the itinerant Ag layers partially occupy three different sites. As a charge-balanced Zintl phase, first-principles calculations suggest that it is a gapless system [9]. We have performed a systematic study of SrAg4As2 through transport and thermodynamic measurements. We show that at least one nonmagnetic phase transition exists in this material and affects the electronic states in the system and results in various anomalies across the transition in its physical properties. In sharp contrast with the first-principles calculations which were performed on the room-temperature crystal structure, by examining the quantum oscillations in this material, we reveal a few much smaller Fermi pockets with light masses, pointing to the change of Fermi surface topology caused by the low-temperature structural distortion.

## II Single-crystal growth and experimental methods

The single crystals of SrAg4As2 were grown via the self-flux method. The starting materials Sr and Ag2As were mixed according to the molar ratio Sr : Ag2As = 1 : 4. They were loaded into a 2-ml alumina crucible and sealed inside an evacuated quartz tube. The growth ampoule was heated to 1100 degC and slowly cooled to 650 degC at a rate of 5 degC/h, at which temperature the single crystals were separated by decanting the flux in a centrifuge. Sizable platelike single crystals were harvested, as shown in the left inset of Fig. 1(a). The typical size of the crystals can be up to 3 x 3 x 0.5 mm3 and the as-grown surface is the _ab_ plane.

Electrical resistivity, Hall coefficient, and heat capacity data up to 300 K were collected using a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (QD PPMS Dyna-cool). Seebeck coefficient was measured by a homemade probe inserted in the PPMS sample chamber [10]. The resistivity above 300 K was measured using a homemade probe in a tube furnace, where the tube chamber was connected to a vacuum pump to keep the pressure inside below 20 mTorr. The standard four-probe configuration was used in the electrical resistivity (\rho_{xx}) and Hall resistivity (\rho_{yx}) measurements. Four Pt wires were attached to the resistivity bar using Dupont silver paste 7713. During the transport measurements, the magnetic field was swept from -9 to 9 T. The data were then processed to get \rho_{xx} using \rho_{xx}(B)=[\rho_{xx}(B)+\rho_{xx}-(B)]/2 and \rho_{yx} using \rho_{yx}(B)=[\rho_{yx}(B))-\rho_{yx}-(B)]/2. The susceptibility was measured with a QD Magnetic Properties Measurement System (QD MPMS). The high-field \rho_{xx} data up to 35 T were collected at the High Field Magnet Laboratory (HFML) in Nijmegen.

Pressures up to \approx2.13 GPa were applied using a Be-Cu piston pressure cell made by C&T Factory Co. Silicone oil [viscosity 5 cSt (25^{\circ}C), Sigma-Aldrich] was used as the pressure medium. The hydrostaticity of silicone oil of a wide range of viscosities has been studied and was found to be an excellent pressure medium even up to extremely high pressures [11,12]. The feedthrough was sealed using Stycast 2850 FT. We determined the pressure inside the sample space through the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition of Pb.

First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were carried out to study the electronic structure. The full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method and the generalized gradient approximation of the exchange-correlation potential as implemented in the wien2k package were used [13].

## III III. Experimental results and discussion

### A. Physical properties of SrAg_{4}As_{2}

The temperature-dependent resistivity, heat capacity, and susceptibility of SrAg_{4}As_{2} up to 300 K are presented in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). It is a diamagnetic metal with \rho_{0} around 3\mu\Omega cm. Upon cooling, between T_{1}\sim 102 K and T_{2}\sim 117 K, aside from subsequent slope changes in resistivity as shown in Fig. 1(a) and subsequent slope changes in susceptibility as shown in the inset of Fig. 1(b), two broad peaks in heat capacity [Fig. 1(a)], which are distinct from the heat capacity with a first-order phase transition [14], are observed, featuring second-order phase transitions. The Debye temperature inferred from the low-temperature heat capacity is 140 K. The diamagnetic susceptibility is mainly due to the core diamagnetism of the heavy silver atoms and Landau diamagnetism, suggesting that the phase transitions lack a magnetic nature. Hereafter, we will call these transitions as the low-temperature phase transitions. The left inset of Fig. 1(a) shows the temperature-dependent resistivity data up to 750 K. Upon warming, aside from the slope changes between 102 and 117 K, an additional resistivity slope change was observed at T_{h}\sim 715 K, suggesting an additional high-temperature nonmagnetic phase transition in this compound.

The temperature-dependent Hall resistivity \rho_{yx} and magnetoresistance (MR) taken at 9 T are shown in Fig. 1(c). While the nonlinear field dependence of \rho_{yx} shown in the inset of Fig. 1(c) suggests multiband transport, the positive sign of \rho_{yx} suggests that holes dominate the transport. Anomalies appear in both \rho_{yx}(T) and MR(T). Upon cooling, \rho_{yx} first slightly increases by 8\% from 300 K to the transition temperature, where it exhibits a sudden drop back to the room-temperature value; it then roughly remains constant at lower temperatures. In contrast to the roughly temperature independent \rho_{yx}, upon cooling, the magnitude of the MR first increases by 50\% across the transition; then it monotonically grows by seven times down to 2 K. A sharp increase of the MR in the low-temperature region was observed in various nonmagnetic multiband systems, such as the type-II Weyl semimetal WTe_{2}, the weak topological insulator NbAs_{2}, the Weyl semimetal TaAs, etc. [15, 16, 17, 18], where the compensation of holes and electrons can induce the resistivity upturn (so called turn-on

  effect) at low temperatures [19]. For SrAg_{4}As_{2}, the 50% increase in MR likely arises due to the phase transition while the further growth of the MR at lower temperatures may originate from the turn-on effect.

Nonmagnetic phase transitions can be electron driven or lattice driven. Electron-driven Mott phase transition is unlikely here since strong Coulomb interaction is unexpected for Ag^{1+} ions. Lattice-driven structural phase transition is a probable candidate. Meanwhile, considering that Fermi surface nesting may show up in materials with layered structure, electron-driven charge-density-wave (CDW) formation is a possible candidate too. The chance of hosting a CDW transition may not be high since the resistivity anomaly in SrAg_{4}As_{2} does not show the hump feature of a typical CDW phase transition. However, because the CDW may only gap a small portion of the Fermi surface and the formation of CDW can significantly increase the scattering rate, we still can not exclude the possibility. Further investigation using scanning tunneling microscope is needed to check if electron density modulation exists so that the two scenarios can be distinguished. Nevertheless, in both cases, structural distortions will take place. Therefore, hereafter, we will call the transitions around 110 K as low-temperature structural distortions.

### Magnetotransport properties of SrAg_{4}As_{2}

Angle-dependent transverse MR (AMR) measured with the field B perpendicular to the current is a powerful tool to probe the Fermi surface topology since the AMR is sensitive to the mobility tensor \hat{\mu}=\tau\hat{m}^{-1}, where \tau is the relaxation time and \hat{m} is the mass tensor closely related to the Fermi surface topology [20]. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the AMR taken at 9 T at various temperatures with B rotating in the planes perpendicular to the c axis and a axis, respectively. The AMR in Fig. 2(a) with B\perp c shows the threefold angular oscillations with very little anisotropy at all temperatures, consistent with the threefold rotational symmetry of the ab plane and suggesting small in-plane anisotropy. In sharp contrast, the AMR in Fig. 2(b) with B\perp a shows a twofold rotational symmetry, where strong anisotropy with a ratio between the maxima and minima of about 3.5 exists, suggesting a quasi-two-dimensional electronic structure in this compound. The AMR reaches its minimum value when B\parallel ab plane (0^{\circ}) and gradually increases when the field rotates toward the c axis (90^{\circ}) with the maxima somewhere around 45^{\circ}. This morphology suggests a more complex Fermi surface than a simple two-dimensional one. We noticed that at temperatures higher than 100 K, the feature at 45^{\circ} in Fig. 2(b) is gone. It raises the question of whether the appearance of this feature is related to a significant Fermi surface reconstruction caused by the low-temperature structural distortion. To clarify this, we measured AMR at 2 K with B\perp a under various fields, as shown in Fig. 2(c). The solid line is the simulated curve based on a cylindrical Fermi surface assumption. At lower field, the AMR agrees well with the simulated curve and the maximum AMR appears at B\parallel c. With increasing field, deviations appear and the direction where the maximum AMR occurs move further and further away from the c axis. Therefore, the deviation from the two-dimensional Fermi surface observed in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c) is more likely to be due to the fact that the mobility tensor of carriers associated with each Fermi pocket have different temperature and field dependencies.

Figure 2(d) shows the temperature-dependent geometric mean of the mobilities \bar{\mu} while the inset shows the field-dependent electrical conductivity \sigma_{xy} at 2 K which was calculated using \sigma_{xy}=\rho_{yx}/\rho_{xx}^{2}+\rho_{yx}^{2}. According to the standard Bloch-Boltzmann transport theory [21], we inferred the geometric mean of the mobilities \bar{\mu}\equiv\sqrt{\mu_{1}\mu_{2}} using the formula \bar{\mu}=1/B_{\rm max}, where B_{\rm max} is the field at which \sigma_{xy}(B) peaks at \bar{\mu} increases with decreasing temperature with the value of 0.5 m^{2} V^{-1} s^{-1} at 2 K. This value is larger than that in the nodal line semimetal candidate CaAgAs [22] but smaller than those in WTe_{2}, Cd_{3}As_{2}, etc. [15, 21].

Figure 2(e) shows the field-dependent MR up to 9 T with the current along the a axis. With B\parallel a, MR shows convex behavior with field. Instead of the quadratic field dependence, MR is roughly proportional to B^{1.2} [the bottom inset of Fig. 2(e)]. With B\parallel c, MR shows concave behavior with field, which may be a trend of saturation. However, even with fields up to 35 T along the c axis, no saturation is realized up to 25 K, the highest temperature we measured. MR is roughly proportional to B^{0.75} in an extended field range from

  2 to 35 T and reaches 600% at 0.35 K [the top inset of Fig. 2(e)]. This field dependence holds from 3 to 35 T at 25 K. Nonquadratic field dependence of MR is nontrivial and has been observed in many materials such as the Dirac semimetal Cd_{3}As_{2}, the Weyl semimetal TaAs, etc. [17, 18, 21]. The origin of this nonquadratic field dependence can arise from distinct mechanisms. Magnetism can be excluded since SrAg_{4}As_{2} is nonmagnetic [9]. In the classical region, an open Fermi surface can lead to linear MR and a saturating Hall coefficient. This is not the case here either [23]. In the quantum limit, MR will be linear when only the lowest Landau band participates in the conductivity [24, 25]. However, the nonquadratic response in SrAg_{4}As_{2} appears at very low-field region, which is away from the quantum region. Disordered systems with high mobilities, such as Ag_{2}Se, Dirac semimetal Cd_{3}As_{2}, and few-layer black phosphorus [21, 26, 27, 28] also show linear MR. This has been investigated using the classical disorder model [27], where Monte Carlo simulation shows that the linear MR in disordered materials with high mobility can come from the spatial fluctuation of local current density. As we will show later, indeed, the charge carriers in SrAg_{4}As_{2} have high mobilities and small effective masses. Therefore, the linear MR in SrAg_{4}As_{2} may suggest that local current density fluctuation plays a key role here.

### Quantum oscillations of SrAg_{4}As_{2}

Quantum oscillations are observed in both resistivity and magnetization measurements above 1 T at low temperatures, as shown in Fig. 3(a). To shed light on the Fermi surface topology in the low-temperature structure, we performed a systematic study of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) quantum oscillations (QO) and de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) QO for SrAg_{4}As_{2}. According to the Onsager relation, the area S of the extreme cross section of the Fermi surface which is perpendicular to the applied field are related to the oscillation frequency f by the equation f=\frac{\hbar}{2\pi}S[29]. Figure 3(b) presents the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) spectra of the oscillating \rho_{xx_{\rm osc}} and M_{\rm osc}, where \rho_{xx_{\rm osc}} and M_{\rm osc} are obtained by subtracting a polynomial background from \rho_{xx} and M, respectively. Different oscillation frequencies are detected. Combining all three sets of data measured on different samples (see Supplemental Material [30]), we were able to assign the oscillations to four fundamental frequencies (F_{1}=38 T, F_{2}=125 T, F_{3}=173 T, F_{4}=760 T) and the harmonics of F_{2}, as labeled in Fig. 3(b).

Quantum oscillations are a function of both B and T. For the dHvA oscillations which occur in the magnetization, M_{\rm osc}(B,T) can be described by the Lifshits-Kosevich (LK) formula [29]

\[M_{\rm osc}(B,T)\propto(B)^{\lambda}R_{T}R_{D}{\rm sin}[2\pi(F/B+\gamma- \delta)],\] (1)

\[A(B,T)\propto(B)^{\lambda}R_{T}R_{D},\] (2)

\[R_{T}=\frac{\alpha Tm^{*}/Bm_{e}}{{\rm sinh}(\alpha Tm^{*}/Bm_{e})},\] (3)

\[R_{D}={\rm exp}(-\alpha T_{D}m^{*}/Bm_{e}),\] (4)

where A(B,T) is the amplitude of the QO, R_{T} is the thermal damping term which dominates the temperature dependence of the oscillations, R_{D} is the Dingle damping factor which dominates the field dependence of the oscillations, F is the oscillation frequency, T is the temperature, m_{e} is the free-electron mass, \alpha=2\pi^{2}k_{B}m_{e}/e\hbar=14.69 T/K, m^{*} is the cyclotron effective mass, and T_{D}=\frac{\hbar}{2\pi k_{B}} is the Dingle temperature which is a measure of the single-particle scattering rate \tau_{s}. \lambda is a dimensional factor, which is \frac{1}{2} for the three-dimensional (3D) case and 0 for the two-dimensional (2D) case. The phase factor \gamma-\delta and the Berry phase \phi_{B} are related by the equation \phi_{B}=\pi-2\pi\gamma and the phase shift \delta is 0 or \pm\frac{1}{8} for 2D or 3D Fermi surfaces, respectively.

Let us take the dHvA oscillation as an example to explain how data analysis of QO is performed. The experimental QO of a material are a summation of individual oscillations associated with each oscillation frequency. If only one quantum oscillation frequency exists, the data analysis to infer m^{*} and T_{D} is straightforward and is described as follows [22] (method 1). First, by subtracting a smooth background of M(B), we can obtain the oscillation part M_{\rm osc}(B). Then, at each temperature, we extract the amplitude of the M_{\rm osc}(B) at a fixed B_{1} so that a plot of the temperature-dependent oscillation amplitude A(T) can be made. By fitting A(T) using Eq. (1) with B=B_{1}, the m^{*} can be obtained without approximation. Then, at a fixed temperature T_{1}, we can make a plot of the field-dependent oscillation amplitude A(B). By fitting A(B) using Eq. (1) with T=T_{1} and m^{*}, the Dingle temperature T_{D} can be determined. Finally, using m^{*} and T_{D}, and by fitting the M_{\rm osc}(B) at the fixed temperature T_{1}, the Berry phase can be obtained.

However, in most cases, more than one oscillation frequency exists. If we do a fast Fourier transformation (FFT) of M_{\rm osc}(B) and these frequencies are well separated, we can filter out the individual oscillations associated with each frequency [16]. A sanity check can be made to see if the summation of these individual oscillations agrees with the total experimental oscillation. Then, for each individual oscillatory pattern, method 1 can be used to infer m^{*} and T_{D} for that frequency/Fermi pocket without approximation. With the known m^{*}'s and T_{D}'s, a multiband LK fitting of M_{\rm osc}(B) at a fixed temperature T_{1} can be made using Eq. (1) to determine the Berry phase associated with each frequency.

For the above two situations, no approximation of the LK formula is needed during the data analysis. Now, let us move to the most complicated situation where those frequencies are not well separated but overlap with each other and, as a result, individual oscillations cannot be obtained without beats. In this situation, standard FFT data analysis method with an "average" B has to be used (method 2). This is the case for SrAg_{4}As_{2}. First, we performed FFT on M_{\rm osc}(B) in the FFT window of B_{1} and B_{2} at various temperatures. Second, we collected the amplitude of the FFT, A^{\rm FFT}, for each QO FFT peak at various temperatures to get A^{\rm FFT}(B,T). We then fit the data with Eq. (1) to obtain m^{*} where an "average" B of 2/(1/B_{1}+1/B_{2}) is used.

For SrAg_{4}As_{2}, we found that F_{2} in the dHvA oscillations can be relatively nicely band-pass filtered into oscillations with only weak beats, as shown in Fig. 3(c). We then used method 1 to analyze the pattern in Fig. 3(c) to get m^{*}. Six different values were chosen for B_{1}, and the resulted m^{*} are shown as red spheres in Fig. 3(d). They show very  small variation, with m^{*}/m_{e}=0.093(2). Using this value for m^{*},~T_{D} was found to be 2.43(6) K, suggesting a long quantum lifetime of \tau_{s}=0.50(1) ps. This value is a few times longer than that of Cd_{3}As_{2} but similar to the one of ZrTe_{5}[27, 31]. Since SrAg_{4}As_{2} shows partial occupancy which is a necessary condition for the chemical bonding rules to be satisfied [9], it is surprising to see the charge carriers can have such a long quantum lifetime.

We then obtained m^{*} of F_{2} using method 2 by varying B_{1} from 0.5 to 7 T, as shown in Fig. 3(e). We found that m^{*} varies much with the choice of B_{1}. In Fig. 3(e), we also plotted m^{*} of F_{2} obtained using method 1 with 99% of confidence level (2.58 of standard error) as shown in the orange rectangle. We can see that as we increase B_{1} from 0.5 to 7 T, the m^{*} first increases sharply and then starts saturating when B_{1}> 4 T. The saturated value is close to the m^{*} we obtained using method 1. This observation suggests that if a large FFT window is chosen, the effect of the R_{D} term may lead to an unreal effective mass using method 2. Therefore, based on the above observation and considering the fact that a sufficient number of oscillations are necessary for a good FFT analysis, we chose B_{1} as 5 T and B_{2} as 9 T to determine the m^{*} for all other frequencies. The LK fit of the temperature-dependent FFT amplitude gives a fitting error around 1% for all frequencies. Thus, to be more conservative, we used a standard error of 2% for all cyclotron masses, which is the one obtained for F_{2} using method 1. The resulting effective masses are 0.120(2) for F_{1}, 0.093(2) for F_{2}, 0.170(3) for F_{3}, and 0.330(7) for F_{4}.

To further investigate the Fermi surface topology, we studied the angle-dependent SdH oscillations and compared them with the first-principles calculations. The measurement geometry is shown in the inset of Fig. 4(a). B was rotated from the a axis to the c axis and then to the -a axis. The angle-dependent FFT spectra of \rho_{x_{\mathrm{exc}}} obtained using data C are presented in Fig. 4(a). Both F_{2} and F_{3} have minima at B\parallel c and increase with the field B rotating away from the c axis, suggesting that the associated Fermi pockets have the minimum extreme cross sections in the plane perpendicular to c.

To understand the observed SdH, DFT band structure calculations were performed using the crystal structure in Ref. [9] obtained at 300 K. The referenced crystal structure shows that there are four Ag sites. Two of them have very low occupancies [0.051(3) and 0.036(4)], one has a higher occupancy of 0.789(8) and another is set to be fully occupied. To simplify the calculation, the Ag sites with low partial occupancies are ignored while the Ag site with larger partial occupancy is fully occupied. Figure 4(c) shows the density of states (DOS) plot. It suggests a semimetallic character for

(b) The FFT spectra obtained from M_{\mathrm{osc}} (data A), HFML \rho_{x_{\mathrm{exc}}} (data B), and PPMS \rho_{x_{\mathrm{exc}}} (data C). Polynomial fitting is used to remove the smooth background from M(B) and \rho_{x_{\mathrm{exc}}} to get M_{\mathrm{osc}} and \rho_{x_{\mathrm{exc}}}. The FFT was performed from 0.5 to 7 T on M_{\mathrm{osc}} (data A), from 4 to 35 T on HFML \rho_{x_{\mathrm{exc}}} (data B), and from 0.8 to 9 T on PPMS \rho_{x_{\mathrm{exc}}} (data C).

Fits by Lifshits-Kosevich formula are denoted by solid lines.

  SrAg_{4}As_{2}, consistent with experiments. The DOS at the Fermi level is dominated by arsenic p orbitals while the Ag d orbital weights small. Therefore, although our DFT calculation employed simplified crystal structure ignoring the Ag sites with low occupancies, it should keep the main features of the Fermi surface. Figure 4(b) shows the DFT band structure. The feature of the band structure near the Fermi level is not affected by spin-orbit coupling. Two types of Fermi pockets exist, as shown in Fig. 4(d). The hole pocket centered at the \Gamma point is two dimensional along the \Gamma-Z direction with the effective mass of 0.4m_{e} when B\parallel c while the electron pocket centered at the F point is a three-dimensional oblate ellipsoid with the effective mass of 0.5m_{e} when B\parallel c, consistent with the electron-hole compensation suggested by the observed turn-on effect. However, the inferred frequencies from the minimum extreme cross section of the two Fermi pockets are around 1000 T, much larger than F_{1} to F_{3} (7, 125, and 173 T) we observed experimentally but reasonably close to the F_{4}\sim 780 T.

Considering the small SdH Fermi pockets with extremely small effective masses and the dramatic discrepancy between QO and DFT calculations, the Fermi surface topology must have changed significantly due to the low-temperature structural distortion. Unexpected small Fermi pockets have been discovered in cuprates, as the result of the band-folding effect due to the formation of CDW [32, 33], while band folding has been observed in Fe-based superconductors due to the structural and magnetic phase transitions [34]. At low temperatures, the structural modulation expands the unit cell and lowers the symmetry of the crystal. As a consequence, the Brillouin zone is folded and small Fermi pockets can appear. Further investigation is needed to clarify the origin of this low-temperature structural distortion and thus to explain if the small Fermi pockets observed are from a simple band-folding effect.

### Effect of external pressure on SrAg_{4}As_{2}

Tuning the phase transitions using either chemical doping/intercalation or external pressure may result in unusual ground states. For example, suppressing the CDW order in TiSe_{2} using Cu intercalation has led to the appearance of superconductivity [35]. The suppression of SDW in LaFeAsO by F doping on the O sites has made the discovery of the second high-temperature superconducting family [2]. To tune the ground state of SrAg_{4}As_{2}, we applied external pressure

  using silicone oil [viscosity 5 cSt (25 degC), Sigma-Aldrich] as the pressure medium on a piece of SrAgAgAs2 whose residual resistivity ratio (RRR) is \approx18 at ambient pressure. Figure 5(a) shows the evolution of \rho(T) under the application of external pressure up to 2.13 GPa. No superconductivity is observed. Figure 5(b) shows the first derivative of the \rho(T) at various pressures. Below 0.89 GPa, the transition temperature is slightly suppressed with pressure at a rate of 3.2 K/GPa and then starts to increase linearly at a rate of \approx13 K/GPa up to 2.13 GPa, the highest pressure we applied. The T-P phase diagram is summarized in Fig. 5(c) where the nonmagnetic transition temperature T_{s} is determined by the criterion shown in Fig. 5(b). The T-P phase diagram shows a v-shaped pressure dependence of the transition temperature. It is worth noting that silicone oil solidifies at around 1 GPa at room temperature, above which the hydrostaticity is lost. This is evidenced by the peak broadening above 0.89 GPa in Fig. 5(b). However, we believe the enhancement of the T_{s} above 0.89 GPa is intrinsic since the T_{s} increased by \sim20 K from 0.89 to 2.2 GPa and shows no sign of slowing down. The drop in resistivity across the transition \Delta\rho_{xx} was determined using the criterion shown in the inset of Fig. 5(a). \Delta\rho_{xx} first decreases and then increases with pressure, in a similar manner as T_{s}, as shown in Fig. 5(c). Both pressure-dependent transition temperature and \Delta\rho_{xx} that we observe here are reminiscent of the evolution of the CDW transition in SmNiC2 under pressure [36, 37].

## IV Conclusion

In conclusion, SrAg_{4}As_{2} shows electronic changes across the low-temperature structural distortion around 110 K. In addition, a high-temperature structural distortion around 715 K was evidenced by a slope change in resistivity. Angle-dependent MR measurements show small in-plane anisotropy but large out-of-plane anisotropy, suggesting a two-dimensional electronic structure. Multiband transport is observed; large nonsaturating MR was observed with high mobility, consistent with the semimetallic nature revealed by the DFT calculation. MR shows nontrivial field dependence, which may be due to charge fluctuation in this highly disordered material. Both dHvA and SdH oscillation reveal small Fermi pockets with light effective masses. An unusually long quantum lifetime of 0.50(1) ps was determined for the Fermi pocket associated with frequency F_{2}. However, the DFT calculation based on the room-temperature crystal structure leads to Fermi pockets with much larger size and heavier masses. We attribute this discrepancy to the significant change in the Fermi surface topology caused by the low-temperature structural distortion. The application of external hydrostatic pressure first suppresses the transition below 0.89 GPa and then enhances the phase transition linearly at a rate of \approx13 K/GPa up to 2.13 GPa without inducing superconductivity.

###### Abstract

Here, we report a combined study of transport and thermodynamic measurements on the layered pnictide material SrAg4As2. Upon cooling, a drop in electrical and Hall resistivity, a jump in heat capacity, and an increase in susceptibility and magnetoresistance are observed around 110 K. All suggest nonmagnetic phase transitions emerge at around 110 K, likely associated with structural distortions. In sharp contrast with the first-principles calculations based on the crystal structure at room temperature, quantum oscillations reveal small Fermi pockets with light effective masses, suggesting significant change in the Fermi surface topology caused by the low-temperature structural distortion. No superconductivity emerges in SrAg4As2 down to 2 K under pressures up to 2.13 GPa; instead, the low-temperature structural distortion moves up linearly to high temperature at a rate of \approx13 K/GPa above 0.89 GPa.

## I Introduction

Quasi-low-dimensional materials have attracted immense research interest because they often host exotic ground states due to strong quantum and thermal fluctuations. Layered pnictide materials have provided a rich platform to explore these ground states and the competitions among them. For example, the Fermi surface nesting leads to electronic/magnetic instabilities, resulting in spin-density-wave (SDW) state in Fe pnictide superconductors [1,2] and the charge-density wave (CDW) in RAgSb2 family [3,4]. For the former, the SDW order competes with the superconductivity and quantum critical behavior was argued in P-doped BaFe2As2 family [5]. For the latter, the CDW opens a gap at the Dirac point, leading to the exotic properties [6]. Among the layered pnictide, the ones containing AgAs have shown rich structural varieties, such as BaAg2As2 [7] as well the derivatives of the HfCuSi2 structure [8]. In this paper, we focus on the layered ternary pnictide SrAg4As2, which crystallizes in the centrosymmetric trigonal space group R\bar{3}m[9], as shown in the right inset of Fig. 1(a). It can be taken as ordered SrAg2As2 mixed with itinerant Ag layers, where Ag atoms (light blue balls) in the itinerant Ag layers partially occupy three different sites. As a charge-balanced Zintl phase, first-principles calculations suggest that it is a gapless system [9]. We have performed a systematic study of SrAg4As2 through transport and thermodynamic measurements. We show that at least one nonmagnetic phase transition exists in this material and affects the electronic states in the system and results in various anomalies across the transition in its physical properties. In sharp contrast with the first-principles calculations which were performed on the room-temperature crystal structure, by examining the quantum oscillations in this material, we reveal a few much smaller Fermi pockets with light masses, pointing to the change of Fermi surface topology caused by the low-temperature structural distortion.

## II Single-crystal growth and experimental methods

The single crystals of SrAg4As2 were grown via the self-flux method. The starting materials Sr and Ag2As were mixed according to the molar ratio Sr : Ag2As = 1 : 4. They were loaded into a 2-ml alumina crucible and sealed inside an evacuated quartz tube. The growth ampoule was heated to 1100 degC and slowly cooled to 650 degC at a rate of 5 degC/h, at which temperature the single crystals were separated by decanting the flux in a centrifuge. Sizable platelike single crystals were harvested, as shown in the left inset of Fig. 1(a). The typical size of the crystals can be up to 3 x 3 x 0.5 mm3 and the as-grown surface is the _ab_ plane.

Electrical resistivity, Hall coefficient, and heat capacity data up to 300 K were collected using a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (QD PPMS Dyna-cool). Seebeck coefficient was measured by a homemade probe inserted in the PPMS sample chamber [10]. The resistivity above 300 K was measured using a homemade probe in a tube furnace, where the tube chamber was connected to a vacuum pump to keep the pressure inside below 20 mTorr. The standard four-probe configuration was used in the electrical resistivity (\rho_{xx}) and Hall resistivity (\rho_{yx}) measurements. Four Pt wires were attached to the resistivity bar using Dupont silver paste 7713. During the transport measurements, the magnetic field was swept from -9 to 9 T. The data were then processed to get \rho_{xx} using \rho_{xx}(B)=[\rho_{xx}(B)+\rho_{xx}-(B)]/2 and \rho_{yx} using \rho_{yx}(B)=[\rho_{yx}(B))-\rho_{yx}-(B)]/2. The susceptibility was measured with a QD Magnetic Properties Measurement System (QD MPMS). The high-field \rho_{xx} data up to 35 T were collected at the High Field Magnet Laboratory (HFML) in Nijmegen.

Pressures up to \approx2.13 GPa were applied using a Be-Cu piston pressure cell made by C&T Factory Co. Silicone oil [viscosity 5 cSt (25^{\circ}C), Sigma-Aldrich] was used as the pressure medium. The hydrostaticity of silicone oil of a wide range of viscosities has been studied and was found to be an excellent pressure medium even up to extremely high pressures [11,12]. The feedthrough was sealed using Stycast 2850 FT. We determined the pressure inside the sample space through the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition of Pb.

First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were carried out to study the electronic structure. The full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method and the generalized gradient approximation of the exchange-correlation potential as implemented in the wien2k package were used [13].

## III III. Experimental results and discussion

### A. Physical properties of SrAg_{4}As_{2}

The temperature-dependent resistivity, heat capacity, and susceptibility of SrAg_{4}As_{2} up to 300 K are presented in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). It is a diamagnetic metal with \rho_{0} around 3\mu\Omega cm. Upon cooling, between T_{1}\sim 102 K and T_{2}\sim 117 K, aside from subsequent slope changes in resistivity as shown in Fig. 1(a) and subsequent slope changes in susceptibility as shown in the inset of Fig. 1(b), two broad peaks in heat capacity [Fig. 1(a)], which are distinct from the heat capacity with a first-order phase transition [14], are observed, featuring second-order phase transitions. The Debye temperature inferred from the low-temperature heat capacity is 140 K. The diamagnetic susceptibility is mainly due to the core diamagnetism of the heavy silver atoms and Landau diamagnetism, suggesting that the phase transitions lack a magnetic nature. Hereafter, we will call these transitions as the low-temperature phase transitions. The left inset of Fig. 1(a) shows the temperature-dependent resistivity data up to 750 K. Upon warming, aside from the slope changes between 102 and 117 K, an additional resistivity slope change was observed at T_{h}\sim 715 K, suggesting an additional high-temperature nonmagnetic phase transition in this compound.

The temperature-dependent Hall resistivity \rho_{yx} and magnetoresistance (MR) taken at 9 T are shown in Fig. 1(c). While the nonlinear field dependence of \rho_{yx} shown in the inset of Fig. 1(c) suggests multiband transport, the positive sign of \rho_{yx} suggests that holes dominate the transport. Anomalies appear in both \rho_{yx}(T) and MR(T). Upon cooling, \rho_{yx} first slightly increases by 8\% from 300 K to the transition temperature, where it exhibits a sudden drop back to the room-temperature value; it then roughly remains constant at lower temperatures. In contrast to the roughly temperature independent \rho_{yx}, upon cooling, the magnitude of the MR first increases by 50\% across the transition; then it monotonically grows by seven times down to 2 K. A sharp increase of the MR in the low-temperature region was observed in various nonmagnetic multiband systems, such as the type-II Weyl semimetal WTe_{2}, the weak topological insulator NbAs_{2}, the Weyl semimetal TaAs, etc. [15, 16, 17, 18], where the compensation of holes and electrons can induce the resistivity upturn (so called turn-on

  effect) at low temperatures [19]. For SrAg_{4}As_{2}, the 50% increase in MR likely arises due to the phase transition while the further growth of the MR at lower temperatures may originate from the turn-on effect.

Nonmagnetic phase transitions can be electron driven or lattice driven. Electron-driven Mott phase transition is unlikely here since strong Coulomb interaction is unexpected for Ag^{1+} ions. Lattice-driven structural phase transition is a probable candidate. Meanwhile, considering that Fermi surface nesting may show up in materials with layered structure, electron-driven charge-density-wave (CDW) formation is a possible candidate too. The chance of hosting a CDW transition may not be high since the resistivity anomaly in SrAg_{4}As_{2} does not show the hump feature of a typical CDW phase transition. However, because the CDW may only gap a small portion of the Fermi surface and the formation of CDW can significantly increase the scattering rate, we still can not exclude the possibility. Further investigation using scanning tunneling microscope is needed to check if electron density modulation exists so that the two scenarios can be distinguished. Nevertheless, in both cases, structural distortions will take place. Therefore, hereafter, we will call the transitions around 110 K as low-temperature structural distortions.

### Magnetotransport properties of SrAg_{4}As_{2}

Angle-dependent transverse MR (AMR) measured with the field B perpendicular to the current is a powerful tool to probe the Fermi surface topology since the AMR is sensitive to the mobility tensor \hat{\mu}=\tau\hat{m}^{-1}, where \tau is the relaxation time and \hat{m} is the mass tensor closely related to the Fermi surface topology [20]. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the AMR taken at 9 T at various temperatures with B rotating in the planes perpendicular to the c axis and a axis, respectively. The AMR in Fig. 2(a) with B\perp c shows the threefold angular oscillations with very little anisotropy at all temperatures, consistent with the threefold rotational symmetry of the ab plane and suggesting small in-plane anisotropy. In sharp contrast, the AMR in Fig. 2(b) with B\perp a shows a twofold rotational symmetry, where strong anisotropy with a ratio between the maxima and minima of about 3.5 exists, suggesting a quasi-two-dimensional electronic structure in this compound. The AMR reaches its minimum value when B\parallel ab plane (0^{\circ}) and gradually increases when the field rotates toward the c axis (90^{\circ}) with the maxima somewhere around 45^{\circ}. This morphology suggests a more complex Fermi surface than a simple two-dimensional one. We noticed that at temperatures higher than 100 K, the feature at 45^{\circ} in Fig. 2(b) is gone. It raises the question of whether the appearance of this feature is related to a significant Fermi surface reconstruction caused by the low-temperature structural distortion. To clarify this, we measured AMR at 2 K with B\perp a under various fields, as shown in Fig. 2(c). The solid line is the simulated curve based on a cylindrical Fermi surface assumption. At lower field, the AMR agrees well with the simulated curve and the maximum AMR appears at B\parallel c. With increasing field, deviations appear and the direction where the maximum AMR occurs move further and further away from the c axis. Therefore, the deviation from the two-dimensional Fermi surface observed in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c) is more likely to be due to the fact that the mobility tensor of carriers associated with each Fermi pocket have different temperature and field dependencies.

Figure 2(d) shows the temperature-dependent geometric mean of the mobilities \bar{\mu} while the inset shows the field-dependent electrical conductivity \sigma_{xy} at 2 K which was calculated using \sigma_{xy}=\rho_{yx}/\rho_{xx}^{2}+\rho_{yx}^{2}. According to the standard Bloch-Boltzmann transport theory [21], we inferred the geometric mean of the mobilities \bar{\mu}\equiv\sqrt{\mu_{1}\mu_{2}} using the formula \bar{\mu}=1/B_{\rm max}, where B_{\rm max} is the field at which \sigma_{xy}(B) peaks at \bar{\mu} increases with decreasing temperature with the value of 0.5 m^{2} V^{-1} s^{-1} at 2 K. This value is larger than that in the nodal line semimetal candidate CaAgAs [22] but smaller than those in WTe_{2}, Cd_{3}As_{2}, etc. [15, 21].

Figure 2(e) shows the field-dependent MR up to 9 T with the current along the a axis. With B\parallel a, MR shows convex behavior with field. Instead of the quadratic field dependence, MR is roughly proportional to B^{1.2} [the bottom inset of Fig. 2(e)]. With B\parallel c, MR shows concave behavior with field, which may be a trend of saturation. However, even with fields up to 35 T along the c axis, no saturation is realized up to 25 K, the highest temperature we measured. MR is roughly proportional to B^{0.75} in an extended field range from

  2 to 35 T and reaches 600% at 0.35 K [the top inset of Fig. 2(e)]. This field dependence holds from 3 to 35 T at 25 K. Nonquadratic field dependence of MR is nontrivial and has been observed in many materials such as the Dirac semimetal Cd_{3}As_{2}, the Weyl semimetal TaAs, etc. [17, 18, 21]. The origin of this nonquadratic field dependence can arise from distinct mechanisms. Magnetism can be excluded since SrAg_{4}As_{2} is nonmagnetic [9]. In the classical region, an open Fermi surface can lead to linear MR and a saturating Hall coefficient. This is not the case here either [23]. In the quantum limit, MR will be linear when only the lowest Landau band participates in the conductivity [24, 25]. However, the nonquadratic response in SrAg_{4}As_{2} appears at very low-field region, which is away from the quantum region. Disordered systems with high mobilities, such as Ag_{2}Se, Dirac semimetal Cd_{3}As_{2}, and few-layer black phosphorus [21, 26, 27, 28] also show linear MR. This has been investigated using the classical disorder model [27], where Monte Carlo simulation shows that the linear MR in disordered materials with high mobility can come from the spatial fluctuation of local current density. As we will show later, indeed, the charge carriers in SrAg_{4}As_{2} have high mobilities and small effective masses. Therefore, the linear MR in SrAg_{4}As_{2} may suggest that local current density fluctuation plays a key role here.

### Quantum oscillations of SrAg_{4}As_{2}

Quantum oscillations are observed in both resistivity and magnetization measurements above 1 T at low temperatures, as shown in Fig. 3(a). To shed light on the Fermi surface topology in the low-temperature structure, we performed a systematic study of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) quantum oscillations (QO) and de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) QO for SrAg_{4}As_{2}. According to the Onsager relation, the area S of the extreme cross section of the Fermi surface which is perpendicular to the applied field are related to the oscillation frequency f by the equation f=\frac{\hbar}{2\pi}S[29]. Figure 3(b) presents the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) spectra of the oscillating \rho_{xx_{\rm osc}} and M_{\rm osc}, where \rho_{xx_{\rm osc}} and M_{\rm osc} are obtained by subtracting a polynomial background from \rho_{xx} and M, respectively. Different oscillation frequencies are detected. Combining all three sets of data measured on different samples (see Supplemental Material [30]), we were able to assign the oscillations to four fundamental frequencies (F_{1}=38 T, F_{2}=125 T, F_{3}=173 T, F_{4}=760 T) and the harmonics of F_{2}, as labeled in Fig. 3(b).

Quantum oscillations are a function of both B and T. For the dHvA oscillations which occur in the magnetization, M_{\rm osc}(B,T) can be described by the Lifshits-Kosevich (LK) formula [29]

\[M_{\rm osc}(B,T)\propto(B)^{\lambda}R_{T}R_{D}{\rm sin}[2\pi(F/B+\gamma- \delta)],\] (1)

\[A(B,T)\propto(B)^{\lambda}R_{T}R_{D},\] (2)

\[R_{T}=\frac{\alpha Tm^{*}/Bm_{e}}{{\rm sinh}(\alpha Tm^{*}/Bm_{e})},\] (3)

\[R_{D}={\rm exp}(-\alpha T_{D}m^{*}/Bm_{e}),\] (4)

where A(B,T) is the amplitude of the QO, R_{T} is the thermal damping term which dominates the temperature dependence of the oscillations, R_{D} is the Dingle damping factor which dominates the field dependence of the oscillations, F is the oscillation frequency, T is the temperature, m_{e} is the free-electron mass, \alpha=2\pi^{2}k_{B}m_{e}/e\hbar=14.69 T/K, m^{*} is the cyclotron effective mass, and T_{D}=\frac{\hbar}{2\pi k_{B}} is the Dingle temperature which is a measure of the single-particle scattering rate \tau_{s}. \lambda is a dimensional factor, which is \frac{1}{2} for the three-dimensional (3D) case and 0 for the two-dimensional (2D) case. The phase factor \gamma-\delta and the Berry phase \phi_{B} are related by the equation \phi_{B}=\pi-2\pi\gamma and the phase shift \delta is 0 or \pm\frac{1}{8} for 2D or 3D Fermi surfaces, respectively.

Let us take the dHvA oscillation as an example to explain how data analysis of QO is performed. The experimental QO of a material are a summation of individual oscillations associated with each oscillation frequency. If only one quantum oscillation frequency exists, the data analysis to infer m^{*} and T_{D} is straightforward and is described as follows [22] (method 1). First, by subtracting a smooth background of M(B), we can obtain the oscillation part M_{\rm osc}(B). Then, at each temperature, we extract the amplitude of the M_{\rm osc}(B) at a fixed B_{1} so that a plot of the temperature-dependent oscillation amplitude A(T) can be made. By fitting A(T) using Eq. (1) with B=B_{1}, the m^{*} can be obtained without approximation. Then, at a fixed temperature T_{1}, we can make a plot of the field-dependent oscillation amplitude A(B). By fitting A(B) using Eq. (1) with T=T_{1} and m^{*}, the Dingle temperature T_{D} can be determined. Finally, using m^{*} and T_{D}, and by fitting the M_{\rm osc}(B) at the fixed temperature T_{1}, the Berry phase can be obtained.

However, in most cases, more than one oscillation frequency exists. If we do a fast Fourier transformation (FFT) of M_{\rm osc}(B) and these frequencies are well separated, we can filter out the individual oscillations associated with each frequency [16]. A sanity check can be made to see if the summation of these individual oscillations agrees with the total experimental oscillation. Then, for each individual oscillatory pattern, method 1 can be used to infer m^{*} and T_{D} for that frequency/Fermi pocket without approximation. With the known m^{*}'s and T_{D}'s, a multiband LK fitting of M_{\rm osc}(B) at a fixed temperature T_{1} can be made using Eq. (1) to determine the Berry phase associated with each frequency.

For the above two situations, no approximation of the LK formula is needed during the data analysis. Now, let us move to the most complicated situation where those frequencies are not well separated but overlap with each other and, as a result, individual oscillations cannot be obtained without beats. In this situation, standard FFT data analysis method with an "average" B has to be used (method 2). This is the case for SrAg_{4}As_{2}. First, we performed FFT on M_{\rm osc}(B) in the FFT window of B_{1} and B_{2} at various temperatures. Second, we collected the amplitude of the FFT, A^{\rm FFT}, for each QO FFT peak at various temperatures to get A^{\rm FFT}(B,T). We then fit the data with Eq. (1) to obtain m^{*} where an "average" B of 2/(1/B_{1}+1/B_{2}) is used.

For SrAg_{4}As_{2}, we found that F_{2} in the dHvA oscillations can be relatively nicely band-pass filtered into oscillations with only weak beats, as shown in Fig. 3(c). We then used method 1 to analyze the pattern in Fig. 3(c) to get m^{*}. Six different values were chosen for B_{1}, and the resulted m^{*} are shown as red spheres in Fig. 3(d). They show very  small variation, with m^{*}/m_{e}=0.093(2). Using this value for m^{*},~T_{D} was found to be 2.43(6) K, suggesting a long quantum lifetime of \tau_{s}=0.50(1) ps. This value is a few times longer than that of Cd_{3}As_{2} but similar to the one of ZrTe_{5}[27, 31]. Since SrAg_{4}As_{2} shows partial occupancy which is a necessary condition for the chemical bonding rules to be satisfied [9], it is surprising to see the charge carriers can have such a long quantum lifetime.

We then obtained m^{*} of F_{2} using method 2 by varying B_{1} from 0.5 to 7 T, as shown in Fig. 3(e). We found that m^{*} varies much with the choice of B_{1}. In Fig. 3(e), we also plotted m^{*} of F_{2} obtained using method 1 with 99% of confidence level (2.58 of standard error) as shown in the orange rectangle. We can see that as we increase B_{1} from 0.5 to 7 T, the m^{*} first increases sharply and then starts saturating when B_{1}> 4 T. The saturated value is close to the m^{*} we obtained using method 1. This observation suggests that if a large FFT window is chosen, the effect of the R_{D} term may lead to an unreal effective mass using method 2. Therefore, based on the above observation and considering the fact that a sufficient number of oscillations are necessary for a good FFT analysis, we chose B_{1} as 5 T and B_{2} as 9 T to determine the m^{*} for all other frequencies. The LK fit of the temperature-dependent FFT amplitude gives a fitting error around 1% for all frequencies. Thus, to be more conservative, we used a standard error of 2% for all cyclotron masses, which is the one obtained for F_{2} using method 1. The resulting effective masses are 0.120(2) for F_{1}, 0.093(2) for F_{2}, 0.170(3) for F_{3}, and 0.330(7) for F_{4}.

To further investigate the Fermi surface topology, we studied the angle-dependent SdH oscillations and compared them with the first-principles calculations. The measurement geometry is shown in the inset of Fig. 4(a). B was rotated from the a axis to the c axis and then to the -a axis. The angle-dependent FFT spectra of \rho_{x_{\mathrm{exc}}} obtained using data C are presented in Fig. 4(a). Both F_{2} and F_{3} have minima at B\parallel c and increase with the field B rotating away from the c axis, suggesting that the associated Fermi pockets have the minimum extreme cross sections in the plane perpendicular to c.

To understand the observed SdH, DFT band structure calculations were performed using the crystal structure in Ref. [9] obtained at 300 K. The referenced crystal structure shows that there are four Ag sites. Two of them have very low occupancies [0.051(3) and 0.036(4)], one has a higher occupancy of 0.789(8) and another is set to be fully occupied. To simplify the calculation, the Ag sites with low partial occupancies are ignored while the Ag site with larger partial occupancy is fully occupied. Figure 4(c) shows the density of states (DOS) plot. It suggests a semimetallic character for

The FFT was performed from 0.5 to 7 T on M_{\mathrm{osc}} (data A), from 4 to 35 T on HFML \rho_{x_{\mathrm{exc}}} (data B), and from 0.8 to 9 T on PPMS \rho_{x_{\mathrm{exc}}} (data C).

  SrAg_{4}As_{2}, consistent with experiments. The DOS at the Fermi level is dominated by arsenic p orbitals while the Ag d orbital weights small. Therefore, although our DFT calculation employed simplified crystal structure ignoring the Ag sites with low occupancies, it should keep the main features of the Fermi surface. Figure 4(b) shows the DFT band structure. The feature of the band structure near the Fermi level is not affected by spin-orbit coupling. Two types of Fermi pockets exist, as shown in Fig. 4(d). The hole pocket centered at the \Gamma point is two dimensional along the \Gamma-Z direction with the effective mass of 0.4m_{e} when B\parallel c while the electron pocket centered at the F point is a three-dimensional oblate ellipsoid with the effective mass of 0.5m_{e} when B\parallel c, consistent with the electron-hole compensation suggested by the observed turn-on effect. However, the inferred frequencies from the minimum extreme cross section of the two Fermi pockets are around 1000 T, much larger than F_{1} to F_{3} (7, 125, and 173 T) we observed experimentally but reasonably close to the F_{4}\sim 780 T.

Considering the small SdH Fermi pockets with extremely small effective masses and the dramatic discrepancy between QO and DFT calculations, the Fermi surface topology must have changed significantly due to the low-temperature structural distortion. Unexpected small Fermi pockets have been discovered in cuprates, as the result of the band-folding effect due to the formation of CDW [32, 33], while band folding has been observed in Fe-based superconductors due to the structural and magnetic phase transitions [34]. At low temperatures, the structural modulation expands the unit cell and lowers the symmetry of the crystal. As a consequence, the Brillouin zone is folded and small Fermi pockets can appear. Further investigation is needed to clarify the origin of this low-temperature structural distortion and thus to explain if the small Fermi pockets observed are from a simple band-folding effect.

### Effect of external pressure on SrAg_{4}As_{2}

Tuning the phase transitions using either chemical doping/intercalation or external pressure may result in unusual ground states. For example, suppressing the CDW order in TiSe_{2} using Cu intercalation has led to the appearance of superconductivity [35]. The suppression of SDW in LaFeAsO by F doping on the O sites has made the discovery of the second high-temperature superconducting family [2]. To tune the ground state of SrAg_{4}As_{2}, we applied external pressure

The criterion to determine T_{s} is shown. (c) The temperature-pressure (T-P) phase diagram and the drop in resistivity \Delta\rho_{xx} across the transition as a function of pressure. The error bars correspond to the standard deviation of an average of six calculations.

  using silicone oil [viscosity 5 cSt (25 degC), Sigma-Aldrich] as the pressure medium on a piece of SrAgAgAs2 whose residual resistivity ratio (RRR) is \approx18 at ambient pressure. Figure 5(a) shows the evolution of \rho(T) under the application of external pressure up to 2.13 GPa. No superconductivity is observed. Figure 5(b) shows the first derivative of the \rho(T) at various pressures. Below 0.89 GPa, the transition temperature is slightly suppressed with pressure at a rate of 3.2 K/GPa and then starts to increase linearly at a rate of \approx13 K/GPa up to 2.13 GPa, the highest pressure we applied. The T-P phase diagram is summarized in Fig. 5(c) where the nonmagnetic transition temperature T_{s} is determined by the criterion shown in Fig. 5(b). The T-P phase diagram shows a v-shaped pressure dependence of the transition temperature. It is worth noting that silicone oil solidifies at around 1 GPa at room temperature, above which the hydrostaticity is lost. This is evidenced by the peak broadening above 0.89 GPa in Fig. 5(b). However, we believe the enhancement of the T_{s} above 0.89 GPa is intrinsic since the T_{s} increased by \sim20 K from 0.89 to 2.2 GPa and shows no sign of slowing down. The drop in resistivity across the transition \Delta\rho_{xx} was determined using the criterion shown in the inset of Fig. 5(a). \Delta\rho_{xx} first decreases and then increases with pressure, in a similar manner as T_{s}, as shown in Fig. 5(c). Both pressure-dependent transition temperature and \Delta\rho_{xx} that we observe here are reminiscent of the evolution of the CDW transition in SmNiC2 under pressure [36, 37].

## IV Conclusion

In conclusion, SrAg_{4}As_{2} shows electronic changes across the low-temperature structural distortion around 110 K. In addition, a high-temperature structural distortion around 715 K was evidenced by a slope change in resistivity. Angle-dependent MR measurements show small in-plane anisotropy but large out-of-plane anisotropy, suggesting a two-dimensional electronic structure. Multiband transport is observed; large nonsaturating MR was observed with high mobility, consistent with the semimetallic nature revealed by the DFT calculation. MR shows nontrivial field dependence, which may be due to charge fluctuation in this highly disordered material. Both dHvA and SdH oscillation reveal small Fermi pockets with light effective masses. An unusually long quantum lifetime of 0.50(1) ps was determined for the Fermi pocket associated with frequency F_{2}. However, the DFT calculation based on the room-temperature crystal structure leads to Fermi pockets with much larger size and heavier masses. We attribute this discrepancy to the significant change in the Fermi surface topology caused by the low-temperature structural distortion. The application of external hydrostatic pressure first suppresses the transition below 0.89 GPa and then enhances the phase transition linearly at a rate of \approx13 K/GPa up to 2.13 GPa without inducing superconductivity.
