We have synthesized the fulleride system Sm2C60 (_x_ < 3). It is found that Sm can be intercalated into interstitial sites of C60 to form a solid solution. For the nominal composition \(x\) = 3, the sample shows superconductivity at _T_c = 8 K. X-ray diffraction reveals an orthorhombic structure with \(a\) = 28.17(5) A, \(b\) = 28.07(3) A, and \(c\) = 28.27(3) A, derived from the face-centered cubic cell of \(A\)3C60 by doubling in each direction and analogous to that of Yb2.75C60. The lattice parameters of Sm-doped C60 are significantly larger than those of Yb-doped C60 and the superconducting transition temperature of Sm3C60 is 2 K higher than that of Yb2.75C60.

Since the discovery of C60 and higher fullerenes there has been considerable interest in the chemistry and physical properties of these molecular forms of carbon. Many fullerene-derived solid phases have been synthesized. Particularly, intercalation compounds of C60 have attracted a great deal of interest, due primarily to the existence of superconductivity in some members of the family but also to the richness of the binary phase equilibria vs metal concentration \(x\), temperature \(T\), and hydrostatic pressure \(p\). Superconductivity in potassium-doped C60 was first reported by Hebard _et al._1 Following this observation, the structure and properties of several alkali-metal- (_A_) doped _A_xC60 furtherles have been investigated.2-4 It has been demonstrated that _A_xC60 can give metallic or insulating compounds, depending on the dopant concentration. The \(A\)3C60 fcc phases exhibit superconductivity with a transition temperature that increases with the cubic lattice parameter.5 More recent success in making alkaline-earth metal doped C60 fullerides revealed that superconductivity can also occur in simple-cubic Ca5C60 (Ref. 6) and bcc Ba6C60.7 Ruoff and Tomanek _et al._ have carried out theoretical calculations for the formation enthalpy D_H_ and studied the stability of lanthanide-doped C60.8-9 They found that the early lanthanides could form stable intercalation compounds. However, if Eu and Yb were considered as divalent, Eu- and Yb-intercalated compounds dramatically also became stable. Very recently superconductivity in Yb3C60 has been reported by Ozdas _et al._10 Its structure and stoichiometry were not clear until Ozdas _et al._ recently reported that Yb2.75C60 is responsible for superconductivity and has an orthorhombic superstructure with space group _Pcab_ due to cation-vacancy ordering.11

The synthesis and investigation of more such C60-based superconducting materials are a key to a better understanding of the structures and properties of fullerides. In this context, we report that the lanthanide samarium can be intercalated into the interstices of the C60 structure to form a solid solution Sm2C60 (_x_ < 3). The magnetization measurement shows that samples of nominal composition Sm3C60 are superconducting at _T_c = 8 K.

The pure C60 (99.9%) used in this work was purchased from Hoechst Company, Frankfurt. High-purity samarium metal was broken into powder, weighted, and mixed with C60. The powder mixtures of C60 and samarium were pressed into pellets, which were placed in a high-purity tantalum holder to avoid contaminating the samples with unwanted reaction products. Samples of Sm2C60 with \(x\) = 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were prepared and loaded into quartz glass tubes. All sample preparation was done in a controlled-atmosphere glove box where the oxygen and water vapor levels are maintained below a few parts per million. The quartz glass tubes were sealed under a vacuum of 10-5 Torr. Heat treatments were done between 550 and 600 degC with a duration of several hours. We have found that the optimum reaction temperatures are different for different concentrations of samarium. Higher concentrations of samarium require lower temperatures and shorter reaction time. Otherwise, there is a strong amorphous background in x-ray-diffraction patterns. Supposedly, the optimum preparation conditions represent a compromise between the formation of the desired phase and a competing gradual degradation of the fullerene molecule. For high temperatures and long durations, the products are almost completely amorphous. Following heat treatment, samples were removed from the tantalum holders inside the glove box and loaded into 0.5-mm quartz capillaries for x-ray-diffraction measurements. It was found that although samarium is fairly stable in air, the intercalation compounds Sm2C60 are sensitive to air as is the case for alkali- and alkaline-earth metal doped C60.

X-ray-diffraction measurements were carried out with Cu K_a_1 radiation. Figure 1 shows x-ray powder diffraction patterns for four different nominal compositions. Most of the strong peaks could be indexed by using a fcc structure with \(a\) = 14.08(1) A, but some other peaks (especially in the 2_Th_ range 10deg-20deg) could not be indexed. The powder pattern of Sm2C60 (_x_ = 3) is, however, amazingly similar to that of the very recently published compound Yb2.75C60.11 This suggests that Sm2C60 has a structure very similar to that of Yb2.75C60 and that it shows the same cation vacancy ordering leading to a superstructure. Since one out of very eight \(T\) sites in the subcell is vacant, the Sm cations occupying the \(O\) sites and \(T\) sites also experience off-center displacements as the case of Yb-doped C60.11 The four Sm cations occupying the \(O\) sites move from the center of the \(O\) sites towards the neighboring vacancy, while the Sm cations occupying the _T_ sites experience off-center displacements towards the middle of two neighboring C60 molecules. For the sample of nominal composition Sm3C60 , the orthorhombic lattice parameters at ambient temperature are \(a\) = 28.17(5) A, \(b\) = 28.07(3) A, and \(c\) = 28.27(3) A and the systematic extinctions are consistent with space group _Pcab_. [11] As an alternative, lattice parameter refinement with practically the same quality of the fit on sample Sm3C60 with a primitive cubic cell (space group _Pa_3) yields \(a\) = 28.174(9) A. The fit to x-ray-diffraction data of the sample Sm3C60 is represented in Fig. 1(e). Dots are experimental data and the solid curve is a fit based on cubic symmetry _Pa_3 and 38deg rotation of C60's as the case of Yb-doped C60 . We would like to state that the refinements were only done on the lattice constants. Due mainly to limited resolution and intense Sm fluorescence, the quality of the data is not sufficient to do a meaningful Rietveld refinement, in particular, the number of resolved x-ray lines is much smaller than the number of parameters which have to be refined for the structure proposed in Ref. [11]. Due to these problems, we also have to leave the open question of the exact stoichiometry of the new phase. A detailed study of the Sm-C60 phase diagram would be beneficial in this context.

From the series of diffractograms depicted in Fig. 1, it is obvious that in the dilute regime (_x_ = 1.0) a set of new peaks begins to develop mainly in the 2 Th between 10deg and 20deg. As the samarium content increases, the intensities of the new peaks continuously increase and characteristic intensity changes occur for pairs of neighboring peaks like (222)/(004) or (622)/(444). Calculation of simulated powder patterns shows that this is the joint effect of the lattice parameter change and a progressive occupation of the tetrahedral and octahedral voids. For \(x\) < 3, the all peaks can be indexed by the orthorhombic structure with double lattice parameters in each direction with respect to the fcc \(A\)3C60 , and no new peaks can be contributed to the samarium metal. This suggests that Sm-intercalated C60 is behaving like a solid solution in this range of Sm content, the Sm-vacancy ordering takes place as soon as Sm is intercalated into the interstitial sites of C60. For \(x\) > 3, weak peaks corresponding to Sm metal were also observed in the powder patterns, and for the samples with higher concentration, the peak intensities of Sm metal increase and no phase transition is observed.

It is well known that the ionic radius of the intercalants determines the lattice parameters in the intercalated C60 compounds. The lattice parameters for nominal composition Sm3C60 are significantly larger than those of Yb2.75C60 (_a_ = 27.874 A, \(b\) = 27.980 A, and \(c\) = 27.873 A). [11] In the paper of Ozdas _et al._, it is proposed that the oxidation state of Yb is +2, which is supported by near-edge and extended x-ray-absorption fine-structure measurements. [11] The ionic radius of Sm2+ is larger than that Yb2+ , while the ionic radius of Sm3+ is smaller with respect to ionic radius of Yb2+ . The large lattice parameter of Sm3C60 therefore suggests Sm2+. In addition, the theoretical calculation of Ruoff _et al._ indicates that the \(R\)3C60 (_R_ = rare-earth metals) with \(R\)2+ are more stable than with \(R\)3+. [8] It is therefore quite probable that Sm is also divalent. Further research on the electronic structure of Sm-doped C60 is necessary to confirm this.

The temperature dependence of the dc magnetization of samples was measured by using a SQUID magnetometer. Figure 2 shows these measurements for the sample (_x_ = 3) (pattern _d_) shown in Fig. 1. The sample was first cooled to 5 K in zero field and then gradually warmed in a magnetic field of 100 G. The applied field was excluded to about 8 K. At \(T\) = 5 K, a diamagnetic state with 10% shielding was measured. Magnetic flux expulsion in the superconducting state (Meissner effect) was observed when the sample was cooled in a field of 20 G. These measurements yield a Meissner

  fraction of 3%. This lower bound for the volume fraction of the superconducting phase is almost the same as that of alkaline earth metal doped C\({}_{60}\).[7] Although superconductivity was observed in the sample with nominal composition Sm\({}_{3}\)C\({}_{60}\), the superconducting phase could well be Sm\({}_{2.75}\)C\({}_{60}\). The superconducting transition temperature of the sample with nominal composition Sm\({}_{3}\)C\({}_{60}\) is about 2 K higher than that of Yb\({}_{2.75}\)C\({}_{60}\) and the lattice parameters of Sm\({}_{3}\)C\({}_{60}\) are also larger than those of Yb\({}_{2.75}\)C\({}_{60}\). This case is similar to that of \(A_{3}\)C\({}_{60}\) (\(A\) = alkali metals), where \(T_{c}\) also increases as the lattice parameters increase.[3] It is believed that the increase in lattice parameter leads to an increase of the density of states at the Fermi level, \(N(E_{f})\). There is substantial evidence that the electron-phonon coupling plays an important role in C\({}_{60}\) compounds.[1, 12] Within the context of the BCS theory of superconductivity, \(T_{c}\) will depend exponentially on \(N(E_{f})\) and on the effective electron coupling, \(V_{0}\). The fact that \(T_{c}\) of Sm-doped C\({}_{60}\) with the larger lattice parameters is higher than that of Yb-doped C\({}_{60}\) indicates that the increase in \(N(E_{f})\) is the dominant factor in Sm\({}_{x}\)C\({}_{60}\).

In conclusion, we have synthesized new fullerides Sm\({}_{x}\)C\({}_{60}\) (\(x\)\(<\)3), whose structure is similar to that of Yb\({}_{2.75}\)C\({}_{60}\). The sample with the nominal composition Sm\({}_{3}\)C\({}_{60}\) shows a superconducting transition at 8 K, which is 2 K higher than that of Yb\({}_{2.75}\)C\({}_{60}\). Very similar to alkali-metal doped \(A_{3}\)C\({}_{60}\), \(T_{c}\) of rare-earth metal doped C\({}_{60}\) increases with increasing lattice parameter. Further work in this field would have to concentrate on the determination of the rare-earth C\({}_{60}\) phase diagrams, the Sm valency, and on the determination of the electronic structure of the superconducting phase.
