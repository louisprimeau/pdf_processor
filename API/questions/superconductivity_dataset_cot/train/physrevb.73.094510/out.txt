###### Abstract

We report the measurements of the temperature dependence of the resistivity, \rho(_T_), magnetic penetration depth, \lambda(_T_), the lower, H_{c1}(_T_), and upper, H_{c2}(_T_), critical magnetic fields, for single crystals of dodecaboride ZrB_{12}, diboride ZrB_{2}, and thin films of diboride MgB_{2}. We observe a number of deviations from conventional behavior in these materials. Although ZrB_{12} behaves like a simple metal in the normal state, the resistive Debye temperature, 300 K, is three times smaller relative to that (800-1200 K) calculated from the specific heat, C(_T_), data. We observe predominantly quadratic temperature behavior of resistivity in ZrB_{12} below 25 K and in ZrB_{2} below 100 K, indicating the possible importance of the electron-electron interaction in these borides. Superfluid density of ZrB_{12} displays unconventional temperature dependence with pronounced shoulder at _T_/_T__{c} equal to 0.65. Contrary to conventional theories we found a linear temperature dependence of H_{c2}(_T_) for ZrB_{12} from _T__{c} down to 0.35 K. We suggest that both \lambda(_T_) and H_{c2}(_T_) dependencies in ZrB_{12} can be explained by a two band BCS model with different superconducting gap and T_{c}.

## I Introduction

The recent discovery of superconductivity in magnesium diboride [1] has initiated a substantial interest in potential high temperature superconducting transition in other borides. [2] Yet, only nonstoichiometric boride compounds (MoB_{2.5}, NbB_{2.5}, Mo_{2}B, W_{2}B, BeB_{2.75}) demonstrate such transition. [3, 4, 5, 6] The absence of superconducting transition in stoichiometric borides is clearly not in line with the old idea about superconductivity in metallic hydrogen [7] recently applied by Kortus _et al._[8] to explain superconductivity in MgB_{2}. A potential clue to this contradiction my lay not in the small mass of the boron atoms but rather in crystal structure of these boron compounds, in particular in their cluster structure. Crystal structure clearly plays an important role in superconductivity. Although it is widely accepted that the layered structure is crucial for high-_T__{c} superconductivity, one can argue that clusters of light atoms are important for high-_T__{c} as well. In particular, there are a number of rather high-_T__{c} superconductors among three-dimensional (3D) cluster compounds. Those are alkali metal doped C_{60} compounds (fulerides) _Me__{5}C_{60} (_Me_= K, Na, Rb, Cs) with the highest _T__{c} up to 33 K for RbCs_{2}C_{60}. [9, 10] It is also known that boron atoms form clusters. These are octahedral B_{6} clusters in \beta-richmondehedral boron, and cubocathadral B_{12} clusters in \alphaFeB_{12}.

The quest for superconductivity in these cluster compounds has a long history. Several superconducting cubic hexaborides, _Me_B_{6}, and dodecaborides, _Me_B_{12}, have been discovered by Matthias _et al._ back in late 1960's [11] (_Me_=Sc, Y, Zr, La, Lu, Th). Many other cluster borides (_Me_=Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm) were found to be ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. [11, 12] It was suggested [3] that the superconductivity in YB_{6} and ZrB_{12} (_T__{c} of 6.5-7.1 and 6.03 K, respectively [3]) is exactly due to the effect of a cluster of light boron atoms. At the same time, a much smaller isotope effect on T_{c} for boron in comparison with Zr isotopic substitution suggests that the boron in ZrB_{12} serves as inert background for the Zr-driven superconductivity. [13, 14] Clearly a systematic study of ZrB_{12} is needed to address the question of superconductivity in this compound.

Superconductivity in ZrB_{12}-based compounds was discovered a while ago, [11] however, there has been little and controversial effort devoted to the study of basic superconducting and the electron transport properties of these compounds. In our recent study of the electron transport and superconducting properties of polycrystalline ZrB_{12}, [15, 16, 17, 18] we demonstrated that this compound behaves like a normal metal with the usual Bloch-Gruneisen dependence of \rho(_T_) but with rather low resistive Debye temperature (_T__{R}=280 K). The latter is almost three times smaller than Debye temperature obtained from specific heat C(_T_) data. [19] We observed linear temperature dependence of \lambda(_T_) below T_{c}/2 which could be evidence of _d_-wave pairing in this compound. Furthermore, contrary to conventional theories, we found a linear temperature dependence of _H__{c2}(_T_). Recently the band structure calculations of ZrB_{12} (Ref. [20]) have been also reported. It was concluded that the band structure of ZrB_{12} is composed of one open and two closed Fermi surface sheets.

Our data contradict the report of Daghero _et al._[21] dealing with the point-contact spectroscopy (PCS) of single crystals of ZrB_{12} at temperatures close to _T__{c}. In Daghero's report it was concluded that ZrB_{12} is a strong coupling _s_-wave superconductor, with 2D(0)/_kBTc_=4.7. Tsindlekht _et al._[22] came to a similar conclusion from tunneling and magnetic characterization of ZrB_{12} single crystals at the temperatures also very close to _T__{c} (4.5-6 K). Lortz _et al._[19] and Wang _et al._[23] reported C(_T_), \rho(_T_), magnetic susceptibility, and thermal expansion measurements of ZrB_{12} samples prepared by one of us (V.A.G.) and concluded that it is a single gap marginal BCS superconductor which undergoes transition from a type-I superconductor near _T__{c} to a type-II superconductor below 4.6 K with 2D(0)/_kBTc_=3.7, the value that is lower  than that obtained from PCS (4.7) [21] and scanning tunneling microscopy data. [22] A large difference in H_{c2} characteristics reported in the above-mentioned papers was discussed in terms of surface superconductivity. Most of the features of MgB_{2} discovered so far can be explained by a two band superconductivity model. [24] We believe that a test of the predictions of this model for ZrB_{12} may explain observed controversy of published data. Knowledge of the electron transport and superconducting properties in this cluster compound is crucial for understanding these conflicting results.

This has been the motivation for current systematic study of the temperature dependencies of \rho(T), \lambda(T), lower H_{c1}(T), and upper H_{c2}(T), critical magnetic fields in single crystals of ZrB_{12}. In this paper, we confirm unusual superconducting properties of ZrB_{12} observed in Refs. [15, 16, 17, 18] and argue that the published results can be reconciled by two-band superconductivity. Comparative data from ZrB_{2} single crystals and thin films of MgB_{2} are also presented.

The structure of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II we report on the samples details and experimental techniques. Section III describes the electron transport in these compounds and Sec. IV describes the temperature dependence of \lambda(T) in ZrB_{12} samples and MgB_{2} thin films. The data on H_{c1}(T) and H_{c2}(T) are presented in Sec. V. Section VI contains our conclusions.

## II Experimental setup

Under ambient conditions, dodecaboride ZrB_{12} crystallizes in the fcc structure of the UB_{12} type (space group Fm3m, a = 0.74075 nm, [25, 26] see Fig. 1). In this structure, the Zr atoms are located at interstitial openings among the close-packed B_{12} clusters. In contrast, ZrB_{2} shows a phase consisting of a two-dimensional graphitelike monolayer of boron atoms with a honeycomb lattice structure and the lattice parameters a = 0.30815 nm and c = 0.35191 nm (space group P6/mmm), intercalated with a Zr monolayer. [2]

Our ZrB_{12} and ZrB_{2} single crystals were grown using a floating-zone method [17, 18, 25] similar to Ref. [26]. The obtained single crystal ingots had a typical diameter of about 5 to 6 mm and a length of 40 mm. Measured specific weight of the ZrB_{12} rod was 3.60 g/cm^{3}, in a good agreement with the theoretical density. The cell parameter of ZrB_{12}, a = 0.74072\pm 0.00005 nm, is very close to the published values. [26] To assure good quality of our samples we performed the metallographic and x-ray investigations of as-grown ingots. We discovered that most parts of the ZrB_{12} ingot contained a needlelike phase of nonsuperconducting ZrB_{2} (see Fig. 2). We believe that ZrB_{2} needles are due to preparation of ZrB_{12} single crystals from a mixture of a certain amount of ZrB_{2} and an excess of boron. [18, 25] Therefore special care has been taken to cut the samples from ZrB_{2} phase-free parts.

For this study, two highly crystalline, superconducting films of MgB_{2} were grown on an r-plane sapphire substrate in a two-step process. [27] Deposition of boron precursor films via electron-beam evaporation was followed by _ex situ_ post-annealing at 890 ^{\circ}C in the presence of bulk MgB_{2} and Mg vapor. We investigated films of 500 and 700 nm thickness, with corresponding T_{c0}'s of 38 and 39.2 K, respectively. The details of the preparation technique are described elsewhere. [27]

We used the spark erosion technique to cut the single crystal ingots into rectangular \langle 100\rangle oriented bars of about 0.5\times 0.5\times 8 mm^{3}. The samples were lapped with diamond paste and etched in boiled nitrogen acid to remove any damage induced by lapping deteriorated surface layers. A standard four-probe ac (9 Hz) technique was used for resistance measurements. We used _Epotek H20E_ silver epoxy for electrical contacts. Because the sample has a shape of a long rectangular bar its demagnetization factor is nearly zero. A well-defined geometry of the samples provided for the precise \rho(T) and superconducting properties measurements. Temperature was measured with platinum (PT-103) and carbon glass (CGR-1-500) sensors. The measurements were performed in the liquid helium variable temperature cryostat in the temperature range between 1.3 and 350 K. Magnetic measurements of \rho(T,H) and \lambda(T,H) were carried out using a superconducting coil in applied fields of up to 6 T down to 1.3 K. Additional dc and ac \rho(H) measurements were performed in the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida (NHMFL) at temperatures down to 0.35 K. The dc magnetic field was applied in the direction of the current flow. The critical temperature of the ZrB_{12} samples, measured by ac susceptibility and \rho(T), was found to be T_{c0}=6.0 K.

  We used the radio frequency LC technique [28] to measure \lambda(T) of ZrB_{12} samples. This technique employs a rectangular solenoid coil into which the sample is placed. The coil is a part of the LC circuit driven by a marginal oscillator operating at 2-10 MHz, or by the impedance meter (VM-508 TESLA 2-50 MHz). Changes in \lambda(T) of the sample lead to the change of the coil's inductance that in turn results in the change of the resonance frequency of the LC circuit. The connection between parameters of the circuit and \lambda(T) is described by following equation:

\[\lambda(T)-\lambda(0)=\delta\frac{f^{-2}(T)-f^{-2}(0)}{f^{-2}(T_{c})-f^{-2}(0)}.\] (1)

Here \delta=0.5(c^{2}\rho/2\,\pi\omega)^{1/2} is the imaginary part of the skin depth above T_{c}, [29] which was determined from the \rho(T) measurements close to T_{c}, f(T) is the resonance frequency of the circuit at arbitrary temperature T, and f(T_{c}) and f(0) are the resonance frequency of the circuit at the superconducting transition and at zero temperature, respectively.

The \lambda(T) dependence in thin MgB_{2} films was investigated employing a single coil mutual inductance technique. This technique, originally proposed in Ref. [30] and improved in Ref. [31], takes advantage of the well-known two-coil geometry. It was successfully used for the observation of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless vortex-antivortex unbinding transition in ultrathin YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-x} films [32] as well as for study of the \lambda(T) dependence on MgB_{2} films. [33] In this radio-frequency technique one measures the temperature dependence of the complex impedance of the LC circuit formed with a one-layer pancake coil located in the proximity (\approx0.1 mm) of the film. Both sample and coil are in a vacuum, but the coil holder is thermally connected with helium bath, while the sample holder is isolated and may be heated. During the experiment the coil was kept at 2.5 K, whereas the sample temperature has been varied from 2.5 up to 100 K. Such design allows us to eliminate possible effects in temperature changes in L and C on the measurements.

The complex mutual inductance M between the coil and the film can be obtained through

\[\mathrm{Re}\;M(T)=L_{0}\Bigg{(}\frac{f_{0}^{2}}{f^{2}(T)}-1\Bigg{)},\] (2)

\[\mathrm{Im}\;M(T)=\frac{1}{[2\,\pi f(T)]^{3}C^{2}}\Bigg{[}\frac{1}{Z(T)}-\frac {1}{Z_{0}(T)}\cdot\frac{f_{0}^{2}(T)}{f_{0}^{2}}\Bigg{]}.\] (3)

Here L, Z(T), f(T), L_{0}, Z(0), and f_{0} are the inductance, the real part of impedance, and the resonant frequency of the circuit with and without the sample, respectively. In the London regime, where the high frequency losses are negligible, one can introduce \Delta\;\mathrm{Re}\;M(T)--the difference between temperature dependant real part of M of the coil with the sample, \mathrm{Re}\;M(T), and that of the coil at T_{0}, \mathrm{Re}\;M(T_{0}). This difference is a function of the London penetration depth \lambda(T):

\[\Delta\;\mathrm{Re}\;M(T)=\pi\mu_{0}\Bigg{\uparrow}_{0}^{\infty}\frac{M(q)dq} {1+2q\lambda\;\mathrm{coth}\Bigg{(}\frac{d}{\lambda}\Bigg{)}},\] (4)

where M(q) plays the role of mutual inductance at a given wave number q in the film plane and depends on the sample-coil distance, d is the sample thickness (additional details can be found in Ref. [31]). A change in \Delta\;\mathrm{Re}\;M(T) is detected as a change of resonant frequency f(T) of the oscillating signal through Eq. (2). This change when put into Eq. (4) yields temperature dependent London penetration depth \lambda(T). Thanks to Eq. (4), we can measure the \lambda(T) of superconducting film by measuring the variation \Delta\;\mathrm{Re}\;M(T) of coil impedance and convert them into \lambda(T).

## III Electron Transport

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of \rho(T) of ZrB_{12} and ZrB_{2} single crystal samples. To emphasize the variation of \rho(T) in a superconductive state, we plot these data in the inset. The transition temperature (T_{c0}=6.0 K) is consistent with the previously reported values for ZrB_{12} (6.03 K) [11, 13] and is larger than that of ZrB_{2} polycrystalline samples (5.5 K). [2] The ZrB_{12} samples demonstrate a remarkably narrow transition with \Delta T=0.04 K. We believe that such a narrow transition is an indicator of the good quality of our samples.

Figure 3 does not show any hints of the superconducting transition in ZrB_{2} single crystals down to 1.3 K, [18] even though superconductivity was observed before at 5.5 K in polycrystalline samples. [2] It was recently suggested [34] that this apparent contradiction could be associated with nonstoichiometry in the zirconium sublattice. Based on the electron structure calculation it was suggested that the Fermi level in ZrB_{2} is located in the pseudogap. [34] The presence of Zr defects in Zr_{0.75}B_{2} leads to the appearance of a very intense peak in the density of states in the vicinity of the pseudogap and subsequent superconductivity. We strongly believe that

  observation of superconductivity at 5.5 K in polycrystalline samples of ZrB_{2} was due to nonstoichiometry of our samples. It is likely that recent observations of superconductivity in nonstoichiometric Nb_{1-x}B_{2} compounds [4, 5] as well as in other nonstoichiometric borides [3, 6] have the same origin.

As we can see from Fig. 3, despite the fact that ZrB_{12} contains mostly boron, its room temperature \rho(T) is only twice as large as that of single crystal samples of ZrB_{2}. The \rho(T) of ZrB_{12} is linear above 90 K with the slope markedly steeper than in ZrB_{2}, with rather low residual resistivity ratio \rho_{300~\rm K}/\rho_{6~\rm K}\approx 10. One can predict a nearly isotropic \rho(T) dependence for fcc ZrB_{12}, which can be described by the Bloch-Gruneisen (BG) equation of the electron-phonon (_e-p_) scattering rate: [35]

\[\rho(t)-\rho(0)=4\rho_{1}t^{5}\!\!\int_{0}^{1t}\frac{x^{5}e^{*}dx}{(e^{*}-1)^{ 2}}=4\rho_{1}t^{5}J_{5}(1/t).\] (5)

Here, \rho(0) is the residual resistivity, \rho_{1}=d\rho(T)/dt is the slope of \rho(T) at high T\!\!>\!\!T_{R}, t\!\!=\!\!T/T_{R}, T_{R} is the resistive Debye temperature, and J_{5}(1/t) is the Debye integral.

It is clear from Fig. 3 that the BG model nicely describes the \rho(T) dependence of both borides, indicating the importance of _e-p_ interaction. It is remarkable that this description works well with constant T_{R}=300 K, which is very close to T_{R}=280 K observed on polycrystalline samples. [16] Clearly, ZrB_{2} (T_{R}=700 K) and ZrB_{12} have very different \rho(T) dependence due to different T_{R}. At the same time the phonon Debye temperature, T_{D}, for ZrB_{12} calculated from C(T) on rather large samples (4.7 x 4.8 x 2.9 mm^{3}) prepared by one of us (V.A.G.) (without metallographic study), [19, 23] is three times higher. Furthermore, T_{D} increases from 800 to 1200 K as temperature rises from T_{c} up to room temperature. We believe that this inconsistency of T_{R} and T_{D} can be explained by limitation of T_{R} by a cutoff phonon wave vector q\!=\!\!k_{B}T/\hbar s. The latter is limited by the Fermi surface (FS) diameter 2k_{F} (Ref. [36]) rather than the highest phonon frequency in the phonon spectrum. [18] Besides some problems may arise in Refs. [19] and [23] due to use of ZrB_{2} phase rich samples as in Fig. 2 (see below).

Actually, \rho(T) of ZrB_{12} and ZrB_{2}, samples deviates from the BG model at low temperatures. [18] We have reported for ZrB_{12}, ZrB_{2}, and MgB_{2} that such deviation is consistent with a sum of electron-electron (_e-e_), aT^{2}, and _e-p_, bT^{5}, contributions to the low-T\rho(T) data. The coefficient b\!=\!\!497.6\rho_{1}/T_{R}^{5} in this plot gives another measure of T_{R} from low-T\rho(T) data. We found this T_{R} in a good agreement with that extracted from full-T BG fit for both ZrB_{2} and ZrB_{12} samples. Therefore the data extracted from this two-term fit are self-consistent with the full Eq. (5) fit. We would like to stress that this observation is only possible in the approximation of constant T_{R}, which is in contradiction with specific heat data. [19] Notice also that the _e-p_ contribution to resistivity \rho(T) can be described through [37]

\[\rho_{cp}(T)\sim\int_{0}^{1t}\alpha^{2}(k,\omega)F(\omega)\Phi(\varepsilon, \omega)d\omega,\] (6)

where \alpha^{2}(k,\omega)F(\omega) is the effective Eliashberg density of states of the phonons, that is _e-p_ coupling function \alpha^{2}(k,\omega) multiplied by the phonon density of states F(\omega) with energy \hbar\omega. [37] The \alpha^{2}(k,\omega) is proportional to the matrix element of _e-p_ coupling averaged over phonon polarization, but only longitudinal phonons are responsible for _e-p_ scattering for spherical FS. At the same time, the phonon specific heat, C(T), can be expressed as

\[C_{ph}\!=\!3\!R\!\int_{0}^{1t/t}F(\omega)\Phi_{1}(\omega)d\omega.\] (7)

Here \Phi(\varepsilon,\omega) and \Phi(\omega) are the occupation factors for _e-p_ and phonon systems, respectively. [37] This means that different phonons are responsible for _e-p_\rho(T) and C(T). In particular, the transverse phonons are much less important for _e-p_ scattering whereas both transverse and longitudinal phonons equally contribute to C(T).

Bordes have rather high T_{D} that depresses the _e-p_ scattering term may be much more pronounced. Indeed, we find very similar values of _a_-coefficient for ZrB_{12} and ZrB_{2} samples in the basal plane (a\!=\!22 and 15 p\Omega cm K^{-2}, respectively). [18] It is interesting to note, however that these values are five times larger than the _e-e_ term for transition metals [a_{\rm Mo}=2.5 p\Omega cm K^{-2} and a_{\rm W} =1.54 p\Omega cm K^{-2} (Ref. [18])]. In general, there are many scattering processes responsible for the T^{2} term in \rho(T) of metals. This term could be due to electron-impurity, electron-dislocation scattering, etc., induced deviation from Mattiessen rule. It is difficult to separate the contributions of these effects, thus it is presently not clear where exactly this T^{2} term comes from. [18] Therefore additional experiments on more pure samples must be performed before a final conclusion about the origin of the T^{3} term in borides can be drawn.

As we mentioned in the Introduction of this paper, there is a contradiction between our description of the \rho(T) and that of Refs. [19] and [21]. Daghero _et al._ suggested BG fit with t^{5} dependence rather than t^{5} on the similar single crystals at low T\!\!<\!\!170 K. [21] The fit assumed model \omega^{2} dependence for the \alpha^{2}(k,\omega)F(\omega) in Eq. (6). Such assumption yielded a good fit to their data at T\!\!<\!\!170 K with the T_{R}=283 K similar to our value of 300 K. We would like to stress, however, that there are strong objections to this modified t^{3} BG model. [18] The main problem of this approach is that it completely ignores intrasheet small angle _e-p_ scattering responsible for T^{5} law and takes into account only intersect scattering events. No evidence of this model was observed in transition and non-transition metals. To check the approach of Daghero's group we used it for our data. Figure 3 displays the BG fit with \rho(T)\!-\!\rho(0)\!\propto\!\!r^{3}J_{3}(1/t) in Eq. (5) at T\!\!<\!\!170 K (dashed line). It is clear that this fit is far from consistency at higher T. We believe this is an indication that \rho(T) cannot be fitted by a modified BG t^{3} equation in the whole temperature range. We suggest that a sum of T^{3} and T^{5} contributions to the low-T\rho(T) may be easily confused with a T^{3} law. [18] Notice that our observation of BG T^{5} intraband \rho(T) dependence rather then intersheet T^{5} law is very important for the given below two-T_{c} model of two-gap superconductivity for ZrB_{12}. In fact, this model is right in the limit of zero interband coupling. The two bands coupling converge two T_{c} to a single one.

  Lortz _et al._[19] report temperature dependence of \rho(T) obtained on the samples cut from ones provided by our group. The \rho(T) is nearly identical to our data, however, interpretation is different. Lorts _et al._ fitted \rho(T) with the generalized Bloch-Gruneisen formula using a decomposition into Einstein modes of \alpha^{2}(k,\omega)F(\omega). The same approach was applied to C(T) data and it was concluded that there are similarities between F(\omega) determined from C(T) and \alpha^{2}(k,\omega)F(\omega) from \rho(T). However the fit to \rho(T) data was obtained using six fitting parameters for \alpha_{F}^{2}F_{k} and \rho(0). We believe such fit is not better than a simple Debye Eq. (5) fit with just two parameters: T_{R} and \rho(0). Furthermore, it is not clear whether the Einstein model is applicable to ZrB_{12}. Finally, we note also that only phonons with a phonon wave vector q=k_{B}T/\hbar s<2k_{F} can participate in \rho(T).[36] Thus T_{R} is limited by the FS diameter 2k_{F} rather than the highest phonon frequency in the phonon spectrum, which in turn is important for T_{D}. Notice also that unconventional T_{D}(T) dependence observed from C(T) data in Refs. [19] and [23] may be due to the sample problems (see Fig. 2).

## IV IV. Penetration depth

In the BCS theory the London penetration depth is identical with \lambda(T) for specular and diffuse surface scattering and for negligible nonlocal effects. For a BCS-type superconductor with the conventional s-wave pairing form, the \lambda(T) has an exponentially vanishing temperature dependence below T_{c}/2 (where \Delta(T) is almost constant):[38]

\[\lambda(T)=\lambda(0)\left[1+\sqrt{\frac{\pi\Delta(0)}{2k_{B}T}}\exp\!\left( -\frac{\Delta(0)}{k_{B}T}\right)\right]\] (8)

for clean limit: l>\xi and

\[\lambda(T)=\lambda(0)\sqrt{\frac{1}{\tanh\!\left(\frac{\Delta(0)}{2k_{B}T} \right)}}\] (9)

for dirty limit: l<\xi.[39] Here \Delta(0) is the energy gap and \lambda(0) is the penetration depth at zero temperature. Close to T_{c}\lambda(T) dependence has a BCS form:[29]

\[\lambda(T)=\frac{\lambda(0)}{\sqrt{2\!\left(1-\frac{T}{T_{c}}\right)}}.\] (10)

Important problems for \lambda(T) measurements are (i) determination of basic superconducting parameter \lambda(0) and (ii) temperature dependence law, to see whether s-wave or d-wave pairing forms exist. Both these problems can be addressed from low-T\lambda(T) dependence according to Eqs. (8) and (9). We used Eq. (1) to extrapolate the resonance frequency f(T) of our LC circuit down to zero temperature. The inset to Fig. 4 shows f^{-2}(T)\propto\lambda(T)-\lambda(0) used for determination f(0). We would like to stress that one can use linear dependence of f^{-2}(T) and hence \lambda(T)-\lambda(0) below 3 K,[15, 16, 17] due to uncertainty with f(0).

The unconventional d-wave pairing symmetry causes the energy gap to be suppressed along nodal directions on the FS. This type of pairing should manifest itself through the linear temperature dependence of \lambda(T)-\lambda(0)\approxT at low T. Such a linear T dependence of \lambda(T) has been used as an fingerprint of d-wave pairing in cuprates.[40, 41] At the same time the microwave \lambda(T) data in fully oxygenated YBCO films show a picture which is consistent with the two-band s-wave superconductivity.[42] Recently, it was suggested[43] that a strictly linear T dependence of \lambda(T) at low temperatures violates the third law of thermodynamics because it results in nonvanished entropy in the zero temperature limit. One can argue that a deviation of the linear T dependence of \lambda(T) should be observed at low-T. Indeed, recent experiments on \lambda(T) in cuprates indicate deviations from linearity at low-T from current carrying zero energy surface Andreev bound states.[44] We believe that the question about linear dependence of \lambda(T) is still open therefore we use BCS Eqs. (8) and (9) to fit our data.

The dashed curve in the inset to Fig. 4 is a result of the fit by aid of BCS Eq. (9) for \lambda(T) with f(0) and \Delta(0) as free parameters. Equation (1) defines the difference between extrapolated \lambda(0) at zero temperature and that at the arbitrary temperature T, \lambda(T)-\lambda(0). We would like to stress that \lambda(T)-\lambda(0) data are robust relative to the change of the oscillator frequency. We observed no change in data when oscillator frequency has been increased from 2 to 10 MHz. Figure 4 shows how \lambda(T)-\lambda(0) changes with reduced temperature, T/T_{c}, at low T for both MgB_{2} (squares) and ZrB_{12} (circles). Our ZrB_{12} data do not extend to as low reduced temperatures as our data for MgB_{2}. This could lead to somewhat larger uncertainty in the estimates for the zero temperature resonance frequency f(0), and hence \lambda(0)=66 nm and \Delta(0) from low-T data for ZrB_{12}.

To address the problem with \lambda(0) we plot \lambda(T)-\lambda(0) data versus BCS reduced temperature: 1/\sqrt{2(1-T/T_{c})} in the region close to T_{c} (see inset to Fig. 5). The advantage of this procedure is the insensitivity of such analysis to the choice

Solid curves represent the single gap dirty limit fit [Eq. (9)] and the dashed line represent the clean limit fit [Eq. (8)] for MgB_{2} and ZrB_{12}. Inset shows f^{-2}(T) and a result of fit by Eqs. (1) and (9).

  of f(0) on this temperature scale. The value of T_{c}=5.992 K used in this data analysis is obtained by getting best linear fit of the \uplambda(T)=\uplambda(0) vs [2(1-T/T_{c})]^{-1/2} plot. Remarkably there is only a few millidegrees difference between T_{c} obtained from the fit and actual T_{c0}. We use the slope of \uplambda(T)=\uplambda(0) vs 1/\sqrt{2(1-T/T_{c})} and Eq. (10) to obtain the value of \uplambda(0) =143 nm. To assure that this \uplambda(0) is in agreement with low-T data, we fit the f^{-2} vs T data with Eqs. (1) and (9) using fixed \uplambda(0)=143 nm and free \Delta(0) at low T. This fit is shown in the inset to Fig. 4 by the solid curve. It is clear from this inset that high-T\uplambda(0) is in agreement with low-T experimental data.

After completion of the analysis of the residual penetration depth we attempt to estimate the residual mean free path l. In particular we employ Drude formula [\rho(0) =3/N_{0}l\nu_{F}e^{2}] where we use measured \rho(0)=1.8\mu\Omega cm, the electron density of states determined from C(T) data, N_{0}=1.83\times 10^{22} st/eV cm, [32, 33] and the electron Fermi velocity of \nu_{F}=1.9\times 10^{8} cm/s [determined from E(k) data [20]], to obtain l=33 nm. This value is smaller than a coherence length [\xi(0)=45 nm, see below] indicating that our samples are in dirty limit. This is confirmed in Fig. 4 by slightly better fits of the \uplambda(T)=\uplambda(0) with Eq. (9) up to T/T_{c}=0.5 (solid curve) relative to the clean limit [Eq. (8)] (dashed curve). In order to investigate the temperature dependence of \uplambda(T) in the whole temperature region, in Fig. 6 we plot the superfluid density \uplambda^{2}(0)\uplambda^{2}(T) versus the reduced T/T_{c} for the ZrB_{12} sample using the \uplambda(0)=143 nm determined from one gap fit close to T_{c} [Eq. (10)] and \uplambda(0)=66 nm as determined from low-T fit [Eq. (9)], for comparison.

One can easily notice from Fig. 6 an unconventional behavior of ZrB_{12} superfluid density with pronounced shoulder at T/T_{c} equal to 0.65 for both \uplambda(0). This feature can be explained by a model of two independent BCS superconducting bands with different plasma frequencies, gaps, and T_{c}'s. [24] We label these two bands as p- and d-bands according to electron structure of ZrB_{12}. [20] Assuming parallel currents through alternating subsystems, the conductivity is a sum of partial bands conductivities. The imaginary part of the conductivity is proportional to 1/\uplambda^{2}, thus we can write in dirty limit: [45]

\[\frac{1}{\uplambda^{2}(T)}=\frac{\Delta_{p}(T)\text{tanh}\bigg{(}\frac{\Delta _{e}}{2k_{B}T}\bigg{)}}{\uplambda_{p}^{2}(0)\Delta_{p}(0)}+\frac{\Delta_{d}(T )\text{tanh}\bigg{(}\frac{\Delta_{d}}{2k_{B}T}\bigg{)}}{\uplambda_{d}^{2}(0) \Delta_{d}(0)}.\] (11)

Here \Delta_{i} is the superconducting energy gap and \uplambda_{i}(0) is residual penetration depth in the p- or d-band. Using this two gap \uplambda(T) BCS-like dependence and interpolation formula \Delta(T)=\uplambda(0)tanh(1.88\sqrt{T_{c}/T}=1) we fit the experimental data with six fitting parameters: \uplambda_{i}, \Delta_{i}, and T_{c}^{\prime}. From this fit we obtain T_{c}^{\prime}=6.0 K, T_{c}^{\prime}=4.35 K, \Delta_{p}(0)=0.73 meV, \Delta_{d}(0)=2.1 meV, \uplambda_{p}(0)=172 nm, and \uplambda_{d}(0)=260 nm, for p- and d-bands, respectively. Dashed and dotted lines in Fig. 6 show the contributions of each p- and d-band, respectively. Clearly low temperature dependence of \uplambda^{2}(0)/\uplambda^{2}(T) is dominated by the d-band with the smallest T_{c}, whereas the high temperature behavior results from the p-band with the larger T_{c}. Notice that this analysis was applied for more reliable \uplambda(0)=143 nm data. The reduced energy gap for p-band, 2\Delta_{p}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}^{\prime}=2.81, is rather small relative to the BCS value 3.52, while d-band value, 2\Delta_{d}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}^{\prime}=6.44, is twice as big. Thus we suggest that ZrB_{12} may have two superconducting bands with different T_{c} and order parameters. Notice that this unusual conclusion may be right for two bands in the limit of zero interband coupling in agreement with resistivity data. Also, the \uplambda(0) of ZrB_{12} may not be constant over the Fermi surface. Here we just tried to fit a data assuming two gap distinct values.

We based our conclusion on the two-gap model for dirty-limit superconductors, suggested by Gurevich. [45] In this model, we can write

\[\frac{1}{\uplambda^{2}(0)}=\frac{4\pi^{2}e^{2}}{\hbar c^{2}}(N_{p}\Delta_{p}D _{p}+N_{d}\Delta_{d}D_{d})=\frac{1}{\uplambda_{p}^{2}(0)}+\frac{1}{\uplambda_ {d}^{2}(0)},\] (12)

where N_{i}, \Delta_{i}, and D_{i} are the density of states, the energy gap, and the diffusivity in p- and d-bands, respectively.

Figure 5: (Color online) Temperature variations of \uplambda(T) for ZrB_{12} sample. The inset shows \uplambda(T)\rightarrow\uplambda(0) vs BCS reduced temperature.

  The calculated band structure of ZrB_{12} is composed of three Fermi surface sheets: an open sheet along the \Gamma L direction with k_{\Gamma X}=0.47 A^{-1}, a quasispherical sheet at point X (k_{\rm{Xt}}=0.37 A^{-1}), and a small sheet at point K (k_{\rm{KT}}=0.14 A^{-1}).[20] It is not clear from Ref. [20] whether the wave functions of carriers on these sheets are due to predominantly p- or d-states. However, it follows that the dominant contribution to the density of states N(E_{g}) is made by the Zr_{kd} and B_{2p}, states, with N_{d}=7.3\times10^{21} st/eV cm^{3} and N_{p}=8.7\times10^{21} st/eV cm^{3}, respectively.[20] The B_{2p} bonding states are responsible for the formation of B_{12} intracluster covalent bonds. In turn, Zr_{kd} bands are due to Zr sublattice. A much smaller boron isotope effect on T_{c} in comparison with Zr isotopic substitution[13, 14] may be an indication of the existence of two separate subsystems with different gaps and T_{c} values. We use this two band approach [Eq. (12)] to obtain p-band diffusivity of D_{p}=57 cm^{2}/s and d-band diffusivity of D_{d}=10 cm^{2}/s. Note that there is almost a six times difference between the p- and d-band diffusivity. We use this result for our discussion of H_{c2}(T) data in the following paragraph.

The important goal of this paper is comparison of ZrB_{12} and MgB_{2} data. For comparison, in Fig. 4 we show the temperature variation of \lambda(T) and in Fig. 6 a \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) versus reduced temperature T/T_{c} for the best MgB_{2} film as determined from the one-coil technique [Eq. (2)] and inversion procedure from Eq. (4) with \lambda(0)=114 nm. The solid line represents BCS single gap calculations by the aid of a single term of Eq. (11) and using finite energy gap [\Delta(0)=1.93 meV] as the fit parameter. According to Fig. 6, there is a very good agreement between experimental data and the single band BCS curve over the full temperature range. Simple conventional s-wave dirty case fit by Eq. (9) agrees remarkably well with the low-T data at T<T_{c}/2 too. The reduced energy gap 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} is evaluated to be 1.2. It is actually within the range of values for 3D \pi bands obtained by PCS on MgB_{2} single crystals [\Delta(0)=2.9 meV],[46] and it agrees with \lambda(T) data obtained from similar radio-frequency experiments on single crystals (1.42 meV[47]), thin films (2.3 meV[33]), and with the theoretical prediction of the two-band model.[24] Rather small 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} observed correspond to the smallest energy gap in the two-gap model for the 3D \pi band. Notice that we studied here the penetration depth in the ab plane due to the samples being c-axis oriented thin films. This feature predicts that our \lambda_{ab}(T) is determined by the small energy gap for the \pi-band. Both \lambda(0) and \Delta(0) are consistent with microwave measurements on similar c-axis oriented thin films (107 nm and 3.2 meV, respectively).[48]

## V V. Upper and lower critical magnetic field

We now turn to the electronic transport data acquired in magnetic field. We measured the dependence of \rho on magnetic field H in the temperature range between 0.35 and 6 K in two different magnets at NHMFL, Tallahassee, FL as well as in our superconducting coil. The first magnet was resistive coil Bitter magnet, and second one was superconducting magnet. Figure 7 displays the resistive magnetic field transitions at various temperatures down to 0.35 K in the field oriented along the sample bar. Two features are clearly seen: (i) as temperature decreases the resistive transition continuously moves to higher fields without any saturation, and (ii) longitudinal magnetoresistivity in the normal state is very small. We used several different approaches to extract H_{c2}(T) from our data. Initially, we extended the maximal derivative d\rho/dH line (dashed line in Fig. 7) up to the normal state \rho(T) level. The crossing point of this line and the normal state \rho(T) gave us the estimate for H_{c2}^{*} at various temperatures, as is indicated by the arrow. Despite a clear broadening at the higher fields, the onset of the resistive transition remains well-defined even at rather low temperatures. To obtain an alternative estimate for H_{c2}, we fitted the field dependence of \rho(H) by a cubic polynomial and calculated the derivative d\rho/dH. We defined H_{c2} as the field where d\rho/dH just starts to deviate from zero (see Fig. 7). It is important to mention that even in single crystalline samples the resistance can be affected by the defects and surface superconductivity. To get even better fill for H_{c2} we used our \lambda(H) data. Figure 8 shows a plot of the \lambda versus the longitudinal magnetic field H measured at various temperatures. [We use the same rectangular coil LC technique as for zero field \lambda(T) measurements.] To avoid demagnetization effects like in Refs. [19] and [21]-[23] we oriented our bar-shape sample with its longer side parallel to the external dc field. Changes in the magnetic dependence of \lambda(H) are directly proportional to the radio-frequency susceptibility of the sample and reflect the bulk properties of it. To deduce the H_{c2} from \lambda(H), we used approaches similar to those applied to \rho(T) data, i.e., a straight-line fit representing the maximum of derivative d\lambda/dH (dashed line in Fig. 8) was extended up to the normal state. H_{c2}^{*} was defined as a crossing point of this line with normal state skin depth \delta. Figure 8 clearly demonstrates a well-defined onset of \lambda(H) transition. We used this onset to estimate H_{c2}.

Figure 9 shows the magnetic field \lambda(H) behavior at very small fields. The \lambda(H)-\lambda(0) curves display clear linear de

The dotted line and the arrows describe how the H_{c2} has been established.

  pendence at low fields caused by the Meissner effect. We determined the value of H_{c1} from the crossing point of two linear dependencies below and above the break point on \lambda(H) (see Fig. 9).

Figure 10 presents the H_{c2}^{*}(T) dependence obtained from extrapolation of the maximum of slopes of both \rho(H) and \lambda(H), as well as those defined at the onsets of the finite \rho(H) and \lambda(H). In the same figure we also plot the H_{c1}(T), acquired by using the break point of \lambda(H) criteria as the definition of the lower critical magnetic field. A remarkable feature of this plot is an identical linear increase of H_{c2} with decreasing temperature for each of the methods of defining H_{c2}. As we can see from this figure, the H_{c2} data obtained at three different magnets agree remarkably well and are aligned along corresponding straight lines indicating linear H_{c2}(T) dependence down to 0.35 K.

To see whether one gap BCS model may work for ZrB_{12}, we extrapolate H_{c2}(T) to zero temperature by use of the derivative of dH_{c2}(T)/dT close to T_{c} and the assumption that the zero temperature H_{c2}(0) = 0.697_{c}dH_{c2}/dT\mid_{T_{c}}.[39] The resulting H_{c2}(0) = 114 mT is substantially lower than the low temperature onset data below 3 K (see Fig. 10). Linear extrapolation of H_{c2}(T) to T = 0 gives H_{c2}(0) = 162 mT. This value is almost the same as that obtained in the polycrystalline ZrB_{12} samples (150 mT).[16] We used this value to obtain the coherence length \xi(0) by employing the relations H_{c2}(0) = \phi_{0}/2\pi\xi^{2}(0). The latter yields \xi(0) = 45 nm, which is substantially larger than a few angstroms coherence length of high-T_{c} superconductors.

In contrast to Refs. [19, 22, and 23] our estimations agree well with the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa = \lambda/\xi. Using our values of \lambda_{p} and \lambda_{d} data we obtain \kappa_{p} = 3.8 and \kappa_{d} = 5.8. Both values of \kappa are larger then 1/\sqrt{2} that implies that ZrB_{12} is clearly a type II superconductor at all T. Using the GL expression for H_{c1}(T) = \phi_{0}\ln\kappa/4\pi\lambda^{2} we obtain H_{c2}/H_{c1} = 2\kappa^{2}/\ln\kappa. From the value H_{c2}(0) obtained above and the H_{c1} data from Fig. 9, we find \kappa = 6.3 and \lambda(0) = 280 nm which is in good agreement with the value \lambda(0) = 260 nm obtained from the two gap BCS fit for d-band. One could argue that the H_{c1}(T) obtained from our magnetic field measurements of \lambda(H) may reflect the flux entry field because of the Bean-Livingston surface barrier, rather then true H_{c1}. However, the entry field H_{BL}=H_{c1}\kappa/\ln\kappa (Ref. [49]) is three times larger than H_{c1} even when one uses \kappa = 6.3, so if we assume \kappa = 23 given by a ratio of H_{c2}/H_{c1} we obtain zero temperature \lambda(0) = 1030 nm, which is unreasonably large compared to one obtained from a BCS fit. This result is another confirmation of our suggestions.

In contrast to the conventional BCS theory,[50]H_{c2}(T) dependence is linear over an extended temperature range with no evidence of saturation down to 0.35 K. Similar linear

  H_{c2}(T) dependence has been observed in MgB_{2} (Refs. [51] and [52]) and BaNbO_{x} (Ref. [53]) compounds. One can describe this behavior of upper critical field using the two gap approach. According to Gurevich,[45] the zero-temperature value of the H_{c2}(0) is significantly enhanced in the two gap dirty limit superconductor model:

\[H_{c2}(0)=\frac{\phi_{b}k_{B}T_{c}}{1.12\hbar\,\sqrt{D_{1}D_{2}}}\exp\left(\frac {g}{2}\right),\] (13)

as compared to the one-gap dirty limit approximation H_{c2}(0)\!=\!\phi_{b}k_{B}T_{c}/1.12\hbar D. Here g is a rather complicated function of the matrix of the BCS superconducting coupling constants.

In the limit of D_{2}\!\ll\!D_{1} we can simply approximate g\!=\!\left|\ln(D_{2}/D_{1})\right|. The large ratio of D_{2}/D_{1} leads to the enhancement of H_{c2}(0) and results in the upward curvature of the H_{c2}(T) close to T\!\!=\!0.[45] According to our \lambda(T) data (see above), we found very different diffusivities for p- and d-bands: D_{p}/D_{d}\!=\!3. Thus we can speculate that the limiting value of H_{c2}(0) is dominated by d-band with lower diffusivity D_{d}\!=\!17 cm^{2}/s, while the derivative dH_{c2}/dT close to T_{c} is due to larger diffusivity band (D_{p}\!=\!56 cm^{2}/s). Indeed, simple estimation of D_{p}\!=\!4\phi_{b}k_{B}/\pi^{2}\hbar(dH_{c2}/dT)\!=\!40 cm^{2}/s from a derivative dH_{c2}/dT\!=\!0.027T/K close to T_{c} gives almost the same diffusivity relative to one estimated from \lambda(T) for the p-band. Thus we believe that the two gap theoretical model of Gurevich qualitatively explains the unconventional linear H_{c2}(T) dependence, which supports our conclusion about the two gap nature of superconductivity in ZrB_{12}.

The possibility of the multigap nature of the superconducting state was predicted for a multiband superconductor with large difference of the e-p interaction at different FS sheets (see Ref. [24] and references therein). To date MgB_{2} has been the only compound with the behavior consistent with the idea of two distinct gaps with the same T_{c}. We believe that our data can add ZrB_{12} as another unconventional example of multigap and multi-T_{c} superconductor. This conclusion contradicts several existing publications, however, we believe we can successfully defend our idea.

The H_{c2}(T) dependence of ZrB_{12} single crystals from the same Kiev group has been measured by three different groups mentioned above and are plotted in Fig. 10. Clearly, our H_{c2}(T) data are very similar to those obtained by Daghero _et al.[21]_ (straight crosses). The agreement is nearly perfect except the last data point at 1.8 K. The disagreement is in the interpretation. The authors of Ref. [21] concluded that ZrB_{12} is a conventional one gap s-wave superconductor with \Delta(0)\!=\!1.22 meV. Thus a strong coupling scenario with reduced energy gap of 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\!=\!4.8 was proposed. One should note, however, that the gap signature in PCS data has been observed in a temperature range close to T_{c}(4.2\!-\!6 K), although the second gap signature feature should have been seen below T_{c}^{\rm q}\!=\!4.35 K, and could have been simply missed by the authors of Ref. [21] because of the limited temperature range of their measurements.

There is nearly a two times difference between H_{c2}(T) obtained from tunneling and magnetic characterization data of Tsindlekht _et al.[22]_ The same can be said about H_{c2}(T) obtained from C(H) and \rho(H) data of Lortz _et al.[19]_ and Wang _et al.[23]_ Tsindlekht _et al._ concluded that ZrB_{12} is a type-II superconductor with the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa slightly above the marginal value of 1/\sqrt{2}. At the same time Wang _et al.[23]_ observed a crossover between type-I and type-II behavior of C(H) at 4.7 K in contrast to our data. In all those approximations, the validity of the one gap BCS picture is implicitly assumed. Large contradiction between the \rho(H) and C(H) data (see Fig. 10) was attributed to surface superconductivity. One can mention another possible reason for this contradiction. In particular, data of Ref. [23] have been measured on the samples cut by a diamond saw without chemical etching of the surface damaged layer. This procedure may create a strong concentration gradient of boron in a surface layer and a substantial manifestation of the surface barriers for the flux lines resulting in this contradiction. One can also note that the discrepancies in H_{c2}(T) can be due to potentially large nonhomogeneity of the ZrB_{12} samples. Indeed, the Fig. 7 inset clearly demonstrates different transitions for our sample with no inclusions of ZrB_{2} and the sample cut from ZrB_{2} reaches part of an ingot (left line).

We believe that this inconsistency of our data and the data of Refs. [19] and [21]-[23] can be (i) due to the two gap nature of superconductivity in ZrB_{12}, (ii) due to large uncertainty in determining of the zero temperature gap from very narrow temperature range of the measurements, and (iii) last but not least due to potentially large nonhomogeneity of the ZrB_{12} samples that could have been used by those authors (see Fig. 2). Although observed two gap behavior of \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) in ZrB_{12} is similar to that in high-T_{c} superconductors, observation of two different T_{c} in these bands is unconventional. This also relates to the linear H_{c2}(T) dependence in the wide temperature range up to T_{c}. Striking two-gap BCS behavior observed calls certainly for a new study of low-T energy gap and H_{c}(T) of ZrB_{12} for understanding the nature of superconductivity in this cluster compound.

## VI Conclusions

We performed systematic study of the temperature and magnetic field dependencies of the resistivity, magnetic penetration depth, lower, H_{c1}(T), and upper, H_{c2}(T), critical magnetic fields of the single crystals dodecaboride ZrB_{12} and resistivity of diboride ZrB_{2}, as well as the magnetic penetration depth in thin films of MgB_{2}. While the temperature dependence of \lambda(T) in thin film MgB_{2} is well described by an isotropic single gap s-type order parameter, we find unconventional behavior of ZrB_{12} superfluid density with pronounced shoulder at T/T_{c} equal to 0.65. The H_{c2}(T) dependencies have been deduced from the \rho(H) and \lambda(H) data. Both techniques reveal an unconventional linear temperature dependence of H_{c2}(T), with a considerably low value of H_{c2}(0)\!=\!0.16 T. We conclude therefore that ZrB_{12} presents a evidence of the unconventional two-gap superconductivity with different \Delta and T_{c} in the different bands.

###### Abstract

We report the measurements of the temperature dependence of the resistivity, \rho(_T_), magnetic penetration depth, \lambda(_T_), the lower, H_{c1}(_T_), and upper, H_{c2}(_T_), critical magnetic fields, for single crystals of dodecaboride ZrB_{12}, diboride ZrB_{2}, and thin films of diboride MgB_{2}. We observe a number of deviations from conventional behavior in these materials. Although ZrB_{12} behaves like a simple metal in the normal state, the resistive Debye temperature, 300 K, is three times smaller relative to that (800-1200 K) calculated from the specific heat, C(_T_), data. We observe predominantly quadratic temperature behavior of resistivity in ZrB_{12} below 25 K and in ZrB_{2} below 100 K, indicating the possible importance of the electron-electron interaction in these borides. Superfluid density of ZrB_{12} displays unconventional temperature dependence with pronounced shoulder at _T_/_T__{c} equal to 0.65. Contrary to conventional theories we found a linear temperature dependence of H_{c2}(_T_) for ZrB_{12} from _T__{c} down to 0.35 K. We suggest that both \lambda(_T_) and H_{c2}(_T_) dependencies in ZrB_{12} can be explained by a two band BCS model with different superconducting gap and T_{c}.

## I Introduction

The recent discovery of superconductivity in magnesium diboride [1] has initiated a substantial interest in potential high temperature superconducting transition in other borides. [2] Yet, only nonstoichiometric boride compounds (MoB_{2.5}, NbB_{2.5}, Mo_{2}B, W_{2}B, BeB_{2.75}) demonstrate such transition. [3, 4, 5, 6] The absence of superconducting transition in stoichiometric borides is clearly not in line with the old idea about superconductivity in metallic hydrogen [7] recently applied by Kortus _et al._[8] to explain superconductivity in MgB_{2}. A potential clue to this contradiction my lay not in the small mass of the boron atoms but rather in crystal structure of these boron compounds, in particular in their cluster structure. Crystal structure clearly plays an important role in superconductivity. Although it is widely accepted that the layered structure is crucial for high-_T__{c} superconductivity, one can argue that clusters of light atoms are important for high-_T__{c} as well. In particular, there are a number of rather high-_T__{c} superconductors among three-dimensional (3D) cluster compounds. Those are alkali metal doped C_{60} compounds (fulerides) _Me__{5}C_{60} (_Me_= K, Na, Rb, Cs) with the highest _T__{c} up to 33 K for RbCs_{2}C_{60}. [9, 10] It is also known that boron atoms form clusters. These are octahedral B_{6} clusters in \beta-richmondehedral boron, and cubocathadral B_{12} clusters in \alphaFeB_{12}.

The quest for superconductivity in these cluster compounds has a long history. Several superconducting cubic hexaborides, _Me_B_{6}, and dodecaborides, _Me_B_{12}, have been discovered by Matthias _et al._ back in late 1960's [11] (_Me_=Sc, Y, Zr, La, Lu, Th). Many other cluster borides (_Me_=Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm) were found to be ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. [11, 12] It was suggested [3] that the superconductivity in YB_{6} and ZrB_{12} (_T__{c} of 6.5-7.1 and 6.03 K, respectively [3]) is exactly due to the effect of a cluster of light boron atoms. At the same time, a much smaller isotope effect on T_{c} for boron in comparison with Zr isotopic substitution suggests that the boron in ZrB_{12} serves as inert background for the Zr-driven superconductivity. [13, 14] Clearly a systematic study of ZrB_{12} is needed to address the question of superconductivity in this compound.

Superconductivity in ZrB_{12}-based compounds was discovered a while ago, [11] however, there has been little and controversial effort devoted to the study of basic superconducting and the electron transport properties of these compounds. In our recent study of the electron transport and superconducting properties of polycrystalline ZrB_{12}, [15, 16, 17, 18] we demonstrated that this compound behaves like a normal metal with the usual Bloch-Gruneisen dependence of \rho(_T_) but with rather low resistive Debye temperature (_T__{R}=280 K). The latter is almost three times smaller than Debye temperature obtained from specific heat C(_T_) data. [19] We observed linear temperature dependence of \lambda(_T_) below T_{c}/2 which could be evidence of _d_-wave pairing in this compound. Furthermore, contrary to conventional theories, we found a linear temperature dependence of _H__{c2}(_T_). Recently the band structure calculations of ZrB_{12} (Ref. [20]) have been also reported. It was concluded that the band structure of ZrB_{12} is composed of one open and two closed Fermi surface sheets.

Our data contradict the report of Daghero _et al._[21] dealing with the point-contact spectroscopy (PCS) of single crystals of ZrB_{12} at temperatures close to _T__{c}. In Daghero's report it was concluded that ZrB_{12} is a strong coupling _s_-wave superconductor, with 2D(0)/_kBTc_=4.7. Tsindlekht _et al._[22] came to a similar conclusion from tunneling and magnetic characterization of ZrB_{12} single crystals at the temperatures also very close to _T__{c} (4.5-6 K). Lortz _et al._[19] and Wang _et al._[23] reported C(_T_), \rho(_T_), magnetic susceptibility, and thermal expansion measurements of ZrB_{12} samples prepared by one of us (V.A.G.) and concluded that it is a single gap marginal BCS superconductor which undergoes transition from a type-I superconductor near _T__{c} to a type-II superconductor below 4.6 K with 2D(0)/_kBTc_=3.7, the value that is lower  than that obtained from PCS (4.7) [21] and scanning tunneling microscopy data. [22] A large difference in H_{c2} characteristics reported in the above-mentioned papers was discussed in terms of surface superconductivity. Most of the features of MgB_{2} discovered so far can be explained by a two band superconductivity model. [24] We believe that a test of the predictions of this model for ZrB_{12} may explain observed controversy of published data. Knowledge of the electron transport and superconducting properties in this cluster compound is crucial for understanding these conflicting results.

This has been the motivation for current systematic study of the temperature dependencies of \rho(T), \lambda(T), lower H_{c1}(T), and upper H_{c2}(T), critical magnetic fields in single crystals of ZrB_{12}. In this paper, we confirm unusual superconducting properties of ZrB_{12} observed in Refs. [15, 16, 17, 18] and argue that the published results can be reconciled by two-band superconductivity. Comparative data from ZrB_{2} single crystals and thin films of MgB_{2} are also presented.

The structure of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II we report on the samples details and experimental techniques. Section III describes the electron transport in these compounds and Sec. IV describes the temperature dependence of \lambda(T) in ZrB_{12} samples and MgB_{2} thin films. The data on H_{c1}(T) and H_{c2}(T) are presented in Sec. V. Section VI contains our conclusions.

## II Experimental setup

Under ambient conditions, dodecaboride ZrB_{12} crystallizes in the fcc structure of the UB_{12} type (space group Fm3m, a = 0.74075 nm, [25, 26] see Fig. 1). In this structure, the Zr atoms are located at interstitial openings among the close-packed B_{12} clusters. In contrast, ZrB_{2} shows a phase consisting of a two-dimensional graphitelike monolayer of boron atoms with a honeycomb lattice structure and the lattice parameters a = 0.30815 nm and c = 0.35191 nm (space group P6/mmm), intercalated with a Zr monolayer. [2]

Our ZrB_{12} and ZrB_{2} single crystals were grown using a floating-zone method [17, 18, 25] similar to Ref. [26]. The obtained single crystal ingots had a typical diameter of about 5 to 6 mm and a length of 40 mm. Measured specific weight of the ZrB_{12} rod was 3.60 g/cm^{3}, in a good agreement with the theoretical density. The cell parameter of ZrB_{12}, a = 0.74072\pm 0.00005 nm, is very close to the published values. [26] To assure good quality of our samples we performed the metallographic and x-ray investigations of as-grown ingots. We discovered that most parts of the ZrB_{12} ingot contained a needlelike phase of nonsuperconducting ZrB_{2} (see Fig. 2). We believe that ZrB_{2} needles are due to preparation of ZrB_{12} single crystals from a mixture of a certain amount of ZrB_{2} and an excess of boron. [18, 25] Therefore special care has been taken to cut the samples from ZrB_{2} phase-free parts.

For this study, two highly crystalline, superconducting films of MgB_{2} were grown on an r-plane sapphire substrate in a two-step process. [27] Deposition of boron precursor films via electron-beam evaporation was followed by _ex situ_ post-annealing at 890 ^{\circ}C in the presence of bulk MgB_{2} and Mg vapor. We investigated films of 500 and 700 nm thickness, with corresponding T_{c0}'s of 38 and 39.2 K, respectively. The details of the preparation technique are described elsewhere. [27]

We used the spark erosion technique to cut the single crystal ingots into rectangular \langle 100\rangle oriented bars of about 0.5\times 0.5\times 8 mm^{3}. The samples were lapped with diamond paste and etched in boiled nitrogen acid to remove any damage induced by lapping deteriorated surface layers. A standard four-probe ac (9 Hz) technique was used for resistance measurements. We used _Epotek H20E_ silver epoxy for electrical contacts. Because the sample has a shape of a long rectangular bar its demagnetization factor is nearly zero. A well-defined geometry of the samples provided for the precise \rho(T) and superconducting properties measurements. Temperature was measured with platinum (PT-103) and carbon glass (CGR-1-500) sensors. The measurements were performed in the liquid helium variable temperature cryostat in the temperature range between 1.3 and 350 K. Magnetic measurements of \rho(T,H) and \lambda(T,H) were carried out using a superconducting coil in applied fields of up to 6 T down to 1.3 K. Additional dc and ac \rho(H) measurements were performed in the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida (NHMFL) at temperatures down to 0.35 K. The dc magnetic field was applied in the direction of the current flow. The critical temperature of the ZrB_{12} samples, measured by ac susceptibility and \rho(T), was found to be T_{c0}=6.0 K.

Figure 2: Etching pattern of a ZrB_{12} single crystal cross section in the (100) plane from the same parts of ingot as in Refs. [19] and [21, 22]. The needlelike long grains are ZrB_{2} phase, while the small black lines correspond to etching pits from small angle boundaries.

Figure 1: Lattice structure of dodecaboride ZrB_{12}. For clarity B_{12} clusters are shown only on the upper face of the lattice.

  We used the radio frequency LC technique [28] to measure \lambda(T) of ZrB_{12} samples. This technique employs a rectangular solenoid coil into which the sample is placed. The coil is a part of the LC circuit driven by a marginal oscillator operating at 2-10 MHz, or by the impedance meter (VM-508 TESLA 2-50 MHz). Changes in \lambda(T) of the sample lead to the change of the coil's inductance that in turn results in the change of the resonance frequency of the LC circuit. The connection between parameters of the circuit and \lambda(T) is described by following equation:

\[\lambda(T)-\lambda(0)=\delta\frac{f^{-2}(T)-f^{-2}(0)}{f^{-2}(T_{c})-f^{-2}(0)}.\] (1)

Here \delta=0.5(c^{2}\rho/2\,\pi\omega)^{1/2} is the imaginary part of the skin depth above T_{c}, [29] which was determined from the \rho(T) measurements close to T_{c}, f(T) is the resonance frequency of the circuit at arbitrary temperature T, and f(T_{c}) and f(0) are the resonance frequency of the circuit at the superconducting transition and at zero temperature, respectively.

The \lambda(T) dependence in thin MgB_{2} films was investigated employing a single coil mutual inductance technique. This technique, originally proposed in Ref. [30] and improved in Ref. [31], takes advantage of the well-known two-coil geometry. It was successfully used for the observation of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless vortex-antivortex unbinding transition in ultrathin YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-x} films [32] as well as for study of the \lambda(T) dependence on MgB_{2} films. [33] In this radio-frequency technique one measures the temperature dependence of the complex impedance of the LC circuit formed with a one-layer pancake coil located in the proximity (\approx0.1 mm) of the film. Both sample and coil are in a vacuum, but the coil holder is thermally connected with helium bath, while the sample holder is isolated and may be heated. During the experiment the coil was kept at 2.5 K, whereas the sample temperature has been varied from 2.5 up to 100 K. Such design allows us to eliminate possible effects in temperature changes in L and C on the measurements.

The complex mutual inductance M between the coil and the film can be obtained through

\[\mathrm{Re}\;M(T)=L_{0}\Bigg{(}\frac{f_{0}^{2}}{f^{2}(T)}-1\Bigg{)},\] (2)

\[\mathrm{Im}\;M(T)=\frac{1}{[2\,\pi f(T)]^{3}C^{2}}\Bigg{[}\frac{1}{Z(T)}-\frac {1}{Z_{0}(T)}\cdot\frac{f_{0}^{2}(T)}{f_{0}^{2}}\Bigg{]}.\] (3)

Here L, Z(T), f(T), L_{0}, Z(0), and f_{0} are the inductance, the real part of impedance, and the resonant frequency of the circuit with and without the sample, respectively. In the London regime, where the high frequency losses are negligible, one can introduce \Delta\;\mathrm{Re}\;M(T)--the difference between temperature dependant real part of M of the coil with the sample, \mathrm{Re}\;M(T), and that of the coil at T_{0}, \mathrm{Re}\;M(T_{0}). This difference is a function of the London penetration depth \lambda(T):

\[\Delta\;\mathrm{Re}\;M(T)=\pi\mu_{0}\Bigg{\uparrow}_{0}^{\infty}\frac{M(q)dq} {1+2q\lambda\;\mathrm{coth}\Bigg{(}\frac{d}{\lambda}\Bigg{)}},\] (4)

where M(q) plays the role of mutual inductance at a given wave number q in the film plane and depends on the sample-coil distance, d is the sample thickness (additional details can be found in Ref. [31]). A change in \Delta\;\mathrm{Re}\;M(T) is detected as a change of resonant frequency f(T) of the oscillating signal through Eq. (2). This change when put into Eq. (4) yields temperature dependent London penetration depth \lambda(T). Thanks to Eq. (4), we can measure the \lambda(T) of superconducting film by measuring the variation \Delta\;\mathrm{Re}\;M(T) of coil impedance and convert them into \lambda(T).

## III Electron Transport

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of \rho(T) of ZrB_{12} and ZrB_{2} single crystal samples. To emphasize the variation of \rho(T) in a superconductive state, we plot these data in the inset. The transition temperature (T_{c0}=6.0 K) is consistent with the previously reported values for ZrB_{12} (6.03 K) [11, 13] and is larger than that of ZrB_{2} polycrystalline samples (5.5 K). [2] The ZrB_{12} samples demonstrate a remarkably narrow transition with \Delta T=0.04 K. We believe that such a narrow transition is an indicator of the good quality of our samples.

Figure 3 does not show any hints of the superconducting transition in ZrB_{2} single crystals down to 1.3 K, [18] even though superconductivity was observed before at 5.5 K in polycrystalline samples. [2] It was recently suggested [34] that this apparent contradiction could be associated with nonstoichiometry in the zirconium sublattice. Based on the electron structure calculation it was suggested that the Fermi level in ZrB_{2} is located in the pseudogap. [34] The presence of Zr defects in Zr_{0.75}B_{2} leads to the appearance of a very intense peak in the density of states in the vicinity of the pseudogap and subsequent superconductivity. We strongly believe that

  observation of superconductivity at 5.5 K in polycrystalline samples of ZrB_{2} was due to nonstoichiometry of our samples. It is likely that recent observations of superconductivity in nonstoichiometric Nb_{1-x}B_{2} compounds [4, 5] as well as in other nonstoichiometric borides [3, 6] have the same origin.

As we can see from Fig. 3, despite the fact that ZrB_{12} contains mostly boron, its room temperature \rho(T) is only twice as large as that of single crystal samples of ZrB_{2}. The \rho(T) of ZrB_{12} is linear above 90 K with the slope markedly steeper than in ZrB_{2}, with rather low residual resistivity ratio \rho_{300~\rm K}/\rho_{6~\rm K}\approx 10. One can predict a nearly isotropic \rho(T) dependence for fcc ZrB_{12}, which can be described by the Bloch-Gruneisen (BG) equation of the electron-phonon (_e-p_) scattering rate: [35]

\[\rho(t)-\rho(0)=4\rho_{1}t^{5}\!\!\int_{0}^{1t}\frac{x^{5}e^{*}dx}{(e^{*}-1)^{ 2}}=4\rho_{1}t^{5}J_{5}(1/t).\] (5)

Here, \rho(0) is the residual resistivity, \rho_{1}=d\rho(T)/dt is the slope of \rho(T) at high T\!\!>\!\!T_{R}, t\!\!=\!\!T/T_{R}, T_{R} is the resistive Debye temperature, and J_{5}(1/t) is the Debye integral.

It is clear from Fig. 3 that the BG model nicely describes the \rho(T) dependence of both borides, indicating the importance of _e-p_ interaction. It is remarkable that this description works well with constant T_{R}=300 K, which is very close to T_{R}=280 K observed on polycrystalline samples. [16] Clearly, ZrB_{2} (T_{R}=700 K) and ZrB_{12} have very different \rho(T) dependence due to different T_{R}. At the same time the phonon Debye temperature, T_{D}, for ZrB_{12} calculated from C(T) on rather large samples (4.7 x 4.8 x 2.9 mm^{3}) prepared by one of us (V.A.G.) (without metallographic study), [19, 23] is three times higher. Furthermore, T_{D} increases from 800 to 1200 K as temperature rises from T_{c} up to room temperature. We believe that this inconsistency of T_{R} and T_{D} can be explained by limitation of T_{R} by a cutoff phonon wave vector q\!=\!\!k_{B}T/\hbar s. The latter is limited by the Fermi surface (FS) diameter 2k_{F} (Ref. [36]) rather than the highest phonon frequency in the phonon spectrum. [18] Besides some problems may arise in Refs. [19] and [23] due to use of ZrB_{2} phase rich samples as in Fig. 2 (see below).

Actually, \rho(T) of ZrB_{12} and ZrB_{2}, samples deviates from the BG model at low temperatures. [18] We have reported for ZrB_{12}, ZrB_{2}, and MgB_{2} that such deviation is consistent with a sum of electron-electron (_e-e_), aT^{2}, and _e-p_, bT^{5}, contributions to the low-T\rho(T) data. The coefficient b\!=\!\!497.6\rho_{1}/T_{R}^{5} in this plot gives another measure of T_{R} from low-T\rho(T) data. We found this T_{R} in a good agreement with that extracted from full-T BG fit for both ZrB_{2} and ZrB_{12} samples. Therefore the data extracted from this two-term fit are self-consistent with the full Eq. (5) fit. We would like to stress that this observation is only possible in the approximation of constant T_{R}, which is in contradiction with specific heat data. [19] Notice also that the _e-p_ contribution to resistivity \rho(T) can be described through [37]

\[\rho_{cp}(T)\sim\int_{0}^{1t}\alpha^{2}(k,\omega)F(\omega)\Phi(\varepsilon, \omega)d\omega,\] (6)

where \alpha^{2}(k,\omega)F(\omega) is the effective Eliashberg density of states of the phonons, that is _e-p_ coupling function \alpha^{2}(k,\omega) multiplied by the phonon density of states F(\omega) with energy \hbar\omega. [37] The \alpha^{2}(k,\omega) is proportional to the matrix element of _e-p_ coupling averaged over phonon polarization, but only longitudinal phonons are responsible for _e-p_ scattering for spherical FS. At the same time, the phonon specific heat, C(T), can be expressed as

\[C_{ph}\!=\!3\!R\!\int_{0}^{1t/t}F(\omega)\Phi_{1}(\omega)d\omega.\] (7)

Here \Phi(\varepsilon,\omega) and \Phi(\omega) are the occupation factors for _e-p_ and phonon systems, respectively. [37] This means that different phonons are responsible for _e-p_\rho(T) and C(T). In particular, the transverse phonons are much less important for _e-p_ scattering whereas both transverse and longitudinal phonons equally contribute to C(T).

Bordes have rather high T_{D} that depresses the _e-p_ scattering term may be much more pronounced. Indeed, we find very similar values of _a_-coefficient for ZrB_{12} and ZrB_{2} samples in the basal plane (a\!=\!22 and 15 p\Omega cm K^{-2}, respectively). [18] It is interesting to note, however that these values are five times larger than the _e-e_ term for transition metals [a_{\rm Mo}=2.5 p\Omega cm K^{-2} and a_{\rm W} =1.54 p\Omega cm K^{-2} (Ref. [18])]. In general, there are many scattering processes responsible for the T^{2} term in \rho(T) of metals. This term could be due to electron-impurity, electron-dislocation scattering, etc., induced deviation from Mattiessen rule. It is difficult to separate the contributions of these effects, thus it is presently not clear where exactly this T^{2} term comes from. [18] Therefore additional experiments on more pure samples must be performed before a final conclusion about the origin of the T^{3} term in borides can be drawn.

As we mentioned in the Introduction of this paper, there is a contradiction between our description of the \rho(T) and that of Refs. [19] and [21]. Daghero _et al._ suggested BG fit with t^{5} dependence rather than t^{5} on the similar single crystals at low T\!\!<\!\!170 K. [21] The fit assumed model \omega^{2} dependence for the \alpha^{2}(k,\omega)F(\omega) in Eq. (6). Such assumption yielded a good fit to their data at T\!\!<\!\!170 K with the T_{R}=283 K similar to our value of 300 K. We would like to stress, however, that there are strong objections to this modified t^{3} BG model. [18] The main problem of this approach is that it completely ignores intrasheet small angle _e-p_ scattering responsible for T^{5} law and takes into account only intersect scattering events. No evidence of this model was observed in transition and non-transition metals. To check the approach of Daghero's group we used it for our data. Figure 3 displays the BG fit with \rho(T)\!-\!\rho(0)\!\propto\!\!r^{3}J_{3}(1/t) in Eq. (5) at T\!\!<\!\!170 K (dashed line). It is clear that this fit is far from consistency at higher T. We believe this is an indication that \rho(T) cannot be fitted by a modified BG t^{3} equation in the whole temperature range. We suggest that a sum of T^{3} and T^{5} contributions to the low-T\rho(T) may be easily confused with a T^{3} law. [18] Notice that our observation of BG T^{5} intraband \rho(T) dependence rather then intersheet T^{5} law is very important for the given below two-T_{c} model of two-gap superconductivity for ZrB_{12}. In fact, this model is right in the limit of zero interband coupling. The two bands coupling converge two T_{c} to a single one.

  Lortz _et al._[19] report temperature dependence of \rho(T) obtained on the samples cut from ones provided by our group. The \rho(T) is nearly identical to our data, however, interpretation is different. Lorts _et al._ fitted \rho(T) with the generalized Bloch-Gruneisen formula using a decomposition into Einstein modes of \alpha^{2}(k,\omega)F(\omega). The same approach was applied to C(T) data and it was concluded that there are similarities between F(\omega) determined from C(T) and \alpha^{2}(k,\omega)F(\omega) from \rho(T). However the fit to \rho(T) data was obtained using six fitting parameters for \alpha_{F}^{2}F_{k} and \rho(0). We believe such fit is not better than a simple Debye Eq. (5) fit with just two parameters: T_{R} and \rho(0). Furthermore, it is not clear whether the Einstein model is applicable to ZrB_{12}. Finally, we note also that only phonons with a phonon wave vector q=k_{B}T/\hbar s<2k_{F} can participate in \rho(T).[36] Thus T_{R} is limited by the FS diameter 2k_{F} rather than the highest phonon frequency in the phonon spectrum, which in turn is important for T_{D}. Notice also that unconventional T_{D}(T) dependence observed from C(T) data in Refs. [19] and [23] may be due to the sample problems (see Fig. 2).

## IV IV. Penetration depth

In the BCS theory the London penetration depth is identical with \lambda(T) for specular and diffuse surface scattering and for negligible nonlocal effects. For a BCS-type superconductor with the conventional s-wave pairing form, the \lambda(T) has an exponentially vanishing temperature dependence below T_{c}/2 (where \Delta(T) is almost constant):[38]

\[\lambda(T)=\lambda(0)\left[1+\sqrt{\frac{\pi\Delta(0)}{2k_{B}T}}\exp\!\left( -\frac{\Delta(0)}{k_{B}T}\right)\right]\] (8)

for clean limit: l>\xi and

\[\lambda(T)=\lambda(0)\sqrt{\frac{1}{\tanh\!\left(\frac{\Delta(0)}{2k_{B}T} \right)}}\] (9)

for dirty limit: l<\xi.[39] Here \Delta(0) is the energy gap and \lambda(0) is the penetration depth at zero temperature. Close to T_{c}\lambda(T) dependence has a BCS form:[29]

\[\lambda(T)=\frac{\lambda(0)}{\sqrt{2\!\left(1-\frac{T}{T_{c}}\right)}}.\] (10)

Important problems for \lambda(T) measurements are (i) determination of basic superconducting parameter \lambda(0) and (ii) temperature dependence law, to see whether s-wave or d-wave pairing forms exist. Both these problems can be addressed from low-T\lambda(T) dependence according to Eqs. (8) and (9). We used Eq. (1) to extrapolate the resonance frequency f(T) of our LC circuit down to zero temperature. The inset to Fig. 4 shows f^{-2}(T)\propto\lambda(T)-\lambda(0) used for determination f(0). We would like to stress that one can use linear dependence of f^{-2}(T) and hence \lambda(T)-\lambda(0) below 3 K,[15, 16, 17] due to uncertainty with f(0).

The unconventional d-wave pairing symmetry causes the energy gap to be suppressed along nodal directions on the FS. This type of pairing should manifest itself through the linear temperature dependence of \lambda(T)-\lambda(0)\approxT at low T. Such a linear T dependence of \lambda(T) has been used as an fingerprint of d-wave pairing in cuprates.[40, 41] At the same time the microwave \lambda(T) data in fully oxygenated YBCO films show a picture which is consistent with the two-band s-wave superconductivity.[42] Recently, it was suggested[43] that a strictly linear T dependence of \lambda(T) at low temperatures violates the third law of thermodynamics because it results in nonvanished entropy in the zero temperature limit. One can argue that a deviation of the linear T dependence of \lambda(T) should be observed at low-T. Indeed, recent experiments on \lambda(T) in cuprates indicate deviations from linearity at low-T from current carrying zero energy surface Andreev bound states.[44] We believe that the question about linear dependence of \lambda(T) is still open therefore we use BCS Eqs. (8) and (9) to fit our data.

The dashed curve in the inset to Fig. 4 is a result of the fit by aid of BCS Eq. (9) for \lambda(T) with f(0) and \Delta(0) as free parameters. Equation (1) defines the difference between extrapolated \lambda(0) at zero temperature and that at the arbitrary temperature T, \lambda(T)-\lambda(0). We would like to stress that \lambda(T)-\lambda(0) data are robust relative to the change of the oscillator frequency. We observed no change in data when oscillator frequency has been increased from 2 to 10 MHz. Figure 4 shows how \lambda(T)-\lambda(0) changes with reduced temperature, T/T_{c}, at low T for both MgB_{2} (squares) and ZrB_{12} (circles). Our ZrB_{12} data do not extend to as low reduced temperatures as our data for MgB_{2}. This could lead to somewhat larger uncertainty in the estimates for the zero temperature resonance frequency f(0), and hence \lambda(0)=66 nm and \Delta(0) from low-T data for ZrB_{12}.

To address the problem with \lambda(0) we plot \lambda(T)-\lambda(0) data versus BCS reduced temperature: 1/\sqrt{2(1-T/T_{c})} in the region close to T_{c} (see inset to Fig. 5). The advantage of this procedure is the insensitivity of such analysis to the choice

Figure 4: (Color online) Temperature variation of the \lambda(T) vs T/T_{c} for ZrB_{12} single crystal (circles) and MgB_{2} thin film (squares) below 0.55T_{c}. Solid curves represent the single gap dirty limit fit [Eq. (9)] and the dashed line represent the clean limit fit [Eq. (8)] for MgB_{2} and ZrB_{12}. Inset shows f^{-2}(T) and a result of fit by Eqs. (1) and (9).

  of f(0) on this temperature scale. The value of T_{c}=5.992 K used in this data analysis is obtained by getting best linear fit of the \uplambda(T)=\uplambda(0) vs [2(1-T/T_{c})]^{-1/2} plot. Remarkably there is only a few millidegrees difference between T_{c} obtained from the fit and actual T_{c0}. We use the slope of \uplambda(T)=\uplambda(0) vs 1/\sqrt{2(1-T/T_{c})} and Eq. (10) to obtain the value of \uplambda(0) =143 nm. To assure that this \uplambda(0) is in agreement with low-T data, we fit the f^{-2} vs T data with Eqs. (1) and (9) using fixed \uplambda(0)=143 nm and free \Delta(0) at low T. This fit is shown in the inset to Fig. 4 by the solid curve. It is clear from this inset that high-T\uplambda(0) is in agreement with low-T experimental data.

After completion of the analysis of the residual penetration depth we attempt to estimate the residual mean free path l. In particular we employ Drude formula [\rho(0) =3/N_{0}l\nu_{F}e^{2}] where we use measured \rho(0)=1.8\mu\Omega cm, the electron density of states determined from C(T) data, N_{0}=1.83\times 10^{22} st/eV cm, [32, 33] and the electron Fermi velocity of \nu_{F}=1.9\times 10^{8} cm/s [determined from E(k) data [20]], to obtain l=33 nm. This value is smaller than a coherence length [\xi(0)=45 nm, see below] indicating that our samples are in dirty limit. This is confirmed in Fig. 4 by slightly better fits of the \uplambda(T)=\uplambda(0) with Eq. (9) up to T/T_{c}=0.5 (solid curve) relative to the clean limit [Eq. (8)] (dashed curve). In order to investigate the temperature dependence of \uplambda(T) in the whole temperature region, in Fig. 6 we plot the superfluid density \uplambda^{2}(0)\uplambda^{2}(T) versus the reduced T/T_{c} for the ZrB_{12} sample using the \uplambda(0)=143 nm determined from one gap fit close to T_{c} [Eq. (10)] and \uplambda(0)=66 nm as determined from low-T fit [Eq. (9)], for comparison.

One can easily notice from Fig. 6 an unconventional behavior of ZrB_{12} superfluid density with pronounced shoulder at T/T_{c} equal to 0.65 for both \uplambda(0). This feature can be explained by a model of two independent BCS superconducting bands with different plasma frequencies, gaps, and T_{c}'s. [24] We label these two bands as p- and d-bands according to electron structure of ZrB_{12}. [20] Assuming parallel currents through alternating subsystems, the conductivity is a sum of partial bands conductivities. The imaginary part of the conductivity is proportional to 1/\uplambda^{2}, thus we can write in dirty limit: [45]

\[\frac{1}{\uplambda^{2}(T)}=\frac{\Delta_{p}(T)\text{tanh}\bigg{(}\frac{\Delta _{e}}{2k_{B}T}\bigg{)}}{\uplambda_{p}^{2}(0)\Delta_{p}(0)}+\frac{\Delta_{d}(T )\text{tanh}\bigg{(}\frac{\Delta_{d}}{2k_{B}T}\bigg{)}}{\uplambda_{d}^{2}(0) \Delta_{d}(0)}.\] (11)

Here \Delta_{i} is the superconducting energy gap and \uplambda_{i}(0) is residual penetration depth in the p- or d-band. Using this two gap \uplambda(T) BCS-like dependence and interpolation formula \Delta(T)=\uplambda(0)tanh(1.88\sqrt{T_{c}/T}=1) we fit the experimental data with six fitting parameters: \uplambda_{i}, \Delta_{i}, and T_{c}^{\prime}. From this fit we obtain T_{c}^{\prime}=6.0 K, T_{c}^{\prime}=4.35 K, \Delta_{p}(0)=0.73 meV, \Delta_{d}(0)=2.1 meV, \uplambda_{p}(0)=172 nm, and \uplambda_{d}(0)=260 nm, for p- and d-bands, respectively. Dashed and dotted lines in Fig. 6 show the contributions of each p- and d-band, respectively. Clearly low temperature dependence of \uplambda^{2}(0)/\uplambda^{2}(T) is dominated by the d-band with the smallest T_{c}, whereas the high temperature behavior results from the p-band with the larger T_{c}. Notice that this analysis was applied for more reliable \uplambda(0)=143 nm data. The reduced energy gap for p-band, 2\Delta_{p}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}^{\prime}=2.81, is rather small relative to the BCS value 3.52, while d-band value, 2\Delta_{d}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}^{\prime}=6.44, is twice as big. Thus we suggest that ZrB_{12} may have two superconducting bands with different T_{c} and order parameters. Notice that this unusual conclusion may be right for two bands in the limit of zero interband coupling in agreement with resistivity data. Also, the \uplambda(0) of ZrB_{12} may not be constant over the Fermi surface. Here we just tried to fit a data assuming two gap distinct values.

We based our conclusion on the two-gap model for dirty-limit superconductors, suggested by Gurevich. [45] In this model, we can write

\[\frac{1}{\uplambda^{2}(0)}=\frac{4\pi^{2}e^{2}}{\hbar c^{2}}(N_{p}\Delta_{p}D _{p}+N_{d}\Delta_{d}D_{d})=\frac{1}{\uplambda_{p}^{2}(0)}+\frac{1}{\uplambda_ {d}^{2}(0)},\] (12)

where N_{i}, \Delta_{i}, and D_{i} are the density of states, the energy gap, and the diffusivity in p- and d-bands, respectively.

Figure 5: (Color online) Temperature variations of \uplambda(T) for ZrB_{12} sample. The inset shows \uplambda(T)\rightarrow\uplambda(0) vs BCS reduced temperature.

  The calculated band structure of ZrB_{12} is composed of three Fermi surface sheets: an open sheet along the \Gamma L direction with k_{\Gamma X}=0.47 A^{-1}, a quasispherical sheet at point X (k_{\rm{Xt}}=0.37 A^{-1}), and a small sheet at point K (k_{\rm{KT}}=0.14 A^{-1}).[20] It is not clear from Ref. [20] whether the wave functions of carriers on these sheets are due to predominantly p- or d-states. However, it follows that the dominant contribution to the density of states N(E_{g}) is made by the Zr_{kd} and B_{2p}, states, with N_{d}=7.3\times10^{21} st/eV cm^{3} and N_{p}=8.7\times10^{21} st/eV cm^{3}, respectively.[20] The B_{2p} bonding states are responsible for the formation of B_{12} intracluster covalent bonds. In turn, Zr_{kd} bands are due to Zr sublattice. A much smaller boron isotope effect on T_{c} in comparison with Zr isotopic substitution[13, 14] may be an indication of the existence of two separate subsystems with different gaps and T_{c} values. We use this two band approach [Eq. (12)] to obtain p-band diffusivity of D_{p}=57 cm^{2}/s and d-band diffusivity of D_{d}=10 cm^{2}/s. Note that there is almost a six times difference between the p- and d-band diffusivity. We use this result for our discussion of H_{c2}(T) data in the following paragraph.

The important goal of this paper is comparison of ZrB_{12} and MgB_{2} data. For comparison, in Fig. 4 we show the temperature variation of \lambda(T) and in Fig. 6 a \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) versus reduced temperature T/T_{c} for the best MgB_{2} film as determined from the one-coil technique [Eq. (2)] and inversion procedure from Eq. (4) with \lambda(0)=114 nm. The solid line represents BCS single gap calculations by the aid of a single term of Eq. (11) and using finite energy gap [\Delta(0)=1.93 meV] as the fit parameter. According to Fig. 6, there is a very good agreement between experimental data and the single band BCS curve over the full temperature range. Simple conventional s-wave dirty case fit by Eq. (9) agrees remarkably well with the low-T data at T<T_{c}/2 too. The reduced energy gap 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} is evaluated to be 1.2. It is actually within the range of values for 3D \pi bands obtained by PCS on MgB_{2} single crystals [\Delta(0)=2.9 meV],[46] and it agrees with \lambda(T) data obtained from similar radio-frequency experiments on single crystals (1.42 meV[47]), thin films (2.3 meV[33]), and with the theoretical prediction of the two-band model.[24] Rather small 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} observed correspond to the smallest energy gap in the two-gap model for the 3D \pi band. Notice that we studied here the penetration depth in the ab plane due to the samples being c-axis oriented thin films. This feature predicts that our \lambda_{ab}(T) is determined by the small energy gap for the \pi-band. Both \lambda(0) and \Delta(0) are consistent with microwave measurements on similar c-axis oriented thin films (107 nm and 3.2 meV, respectively).[48]

## V V. Upper and lower critical magnetic field

We now turn to the electronic transport data acquired in magnetic field. We measured the dependence of \rho on magnetic field H in the temperature range between 0.35 and 6 K in two different magnets at NHMFL, Tallahassee, FL as well as in our superconducting coil. The first magnet was resistive coil Bitter magnet, and second one was superconducting magnet. Figure 7 displays the resistive magnetic field transitions at various temperatures down to 0.35 K in the field oriented along the sample bar. Two features are clearly seen: (i) as temperature decreases the resistive transition continuously moves to higher fields without any saturation, and (ii) longitudinal magnetoresistivity in the normal state is very small. We used several different approaches to extract H_{c2}(T) from our data. Initially, we extended the maximal derivative d\rho/dH line (dashed line in Fig. 7) up to the normal state \rho(T) level. The crossing point of this line and the normal state \rho(T) gave us the estimate for H_{c2}^{*} at various temperatures, as is indicated by the arrow. Despite a clear broadening at the higher fields, the onset of the resistive transition remains well-defined even at rather low temperatures. To obtain an alternative estimate for H_{c2}, we fitted the field dependence of \rho(H) by a cubic polynomial and calculated the derivative d\rho/dH. We defined H_{c2} as the field where d\rho/dH just starts to deviate from zero (see Fig. 7). It is important to mention that even in single crystalline samples the resistance can be affected by the defects and surface superconductivity. To get even better fill for H_{c2} we used our \lambda(H) data. Figure 8 shows a plot of the \lambda versus the longitudinal magnetic field H measured at various temperatures. [We use the same rectangular coil LC technique as for zero field \lambda(T) measurements.] To avoid demagnetization effects like in Refs. [19] and [21]-[23] we oriented our bar-shape sample with its longer side parallel to the external dc field. Changes in the magnetic dependence of \lambda(H) are directly proportional to the radio-frequency susceptibility of the sample and reflect the bulk properties of it. To deduce the H_{c2} from \lambda(H), we used approaches similar to those applied to \rho(T) data, i.e., a straight-line fit representing the maximum of derivative d\lambda/dH (dashed line in Fig. 8) was extended up to the normal state. H_{c2}^{*} was defined as a crossing point of this line with normal state skin depth \delta. Figure 8 clearly demonstrates a well-defined onset of \lambda(H) transition. We used this onset to estimate H_{c2}.

Figure 9 shows the magnetic field \lambda(H) behavior at very small fields. The \lambda(H)-\lambda(0) curves display clear linear de

The dotted line and the arrows describe how the H_{c2} has been established. The inset shows the R(H)/R_{n} near the transition at T=2.3 K for the same sample (right line) and a sample cut from the ZrB_{2} rich part of an ingot (left curve).

  pendence at low fields caused by the Meissner effect. We determined the value of H_{c1} from the crossing point of two linear dependencies below and above the break point on \lambda(H) (see Fig. 9).

Figure 10 presents the H_{c2}^{*}(T) dependence obtained from extrapolation of the maximum of slopes of both \rho(H) and \lambda(H), as well as those defined at the onsets of the finite \rho(H) and \lambda(H). In the same figure we also plot the H_{c1}(T), acquired by using the break point of \lambda(H) criteria as the definition of the lower critical magnetic field. A remarkable feature of this plot is an identical linear increase of H_{c2} with decreasing temperature for each of the methods of defining H_{c2}. As we can see from this figure, the H_{c2} data obtained at three different magnets agree remarkably well and are aligned along corresponding straight lines indicating linear H_{c2}(T) dependence down to 0.35 K.

To see whether one gap BCS model may work for ZrB_{12}, we extrapolate H_{c2}(T) to zero temperature by use of the derivative of dH_{c2}(T)/dT close to T_{c} and the assumption that the zero temperature H_{c2}(0) = 0.697_{c}dH_{c2}/dT\mid_{T_{c}}.[39] The resulting H_{c2}(0) = 114 mT is substantially lower than the low temperature onset data below 3 K (see Fig. 10). Linear extrapolation of H_{c2}(T) to T = 0 gives H_{c2}(0) = 162 mT. This value is almost the same as that obtained in the polycrystalline ZrB_{12} samples (150 mT).[16] We used this value to obtain the coherence length \xi(0) by employing the relations H_{c2}(0) = \phi_{0}/2\pi\xi^{2}(0). The latter yields \xi(0) = 45 nm, which is substantially larger than a few angstroms coherence length of high-T_{c} superconductors.

In contrast to Refs. [19, 22, and 23] our estimations agree well with the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa = \lambda/\xi. Using our values of \lambda_{p} and \lambda_{d} data we obtain \kappa_{p} = 3.8 and \kappa_{d} = 5.8. Both values of \kappa are larger then 1/\sqrt{2} that implies that ZrB_{12} is clearly a type II superconductor at all T. Using the GL expression for H_{c1}(T) = \phi_{0}\ln\kappa/4\pi\lambda^{2} we obtain H_{c2}/H_{c1} = 2\kappa^{2}/\ln\kappa. From the value H_{c2}(0) obtained above and the H_{c1} data from Fig. 9, we find \kappa = 6.3 and \lambda(0) = 280 nm which is in good agreement with the value \lambda(0) = 260 nm obtained from the two gap BCS fit for d-band. One could argue that the H_{c1}(T) obtained from our magnetic field measurements of \lambda(H) may reflect the flux entry field because of the Bean-Livingston surface barrier, rather then true H_{c1}. However, the entry field H_{BL}=H_{c1}\kappa/\ln\kappa (Ref. [49]) is three times larger than H_{c1} even when one uses \kappa = 6.3, so if we assume \kappa = 23 given by a ratio of H_{c2}/H_{c1} we obtain zero temperature \lambda(0) = 1030 nm, which is unreasonably large compared to one obtained from a BCS fit. This result is another confirmation of our suggestions.

In contrast to the conventional BCS theory,[50]H_{c2}(T) dependence is linear over an extended temperature range with no evidence of saturation down to 0.35 K. Similar linear

  H_{c2}(T) dependence has been observed in MgB_{2} (Refs. [51] and [52]) and BaNbO_{x} (Ref. [53]) compounds. One can describe this behavior of upper critical field using the two gap approach. According to Gurevich,[45] the zero-temperature value of the H_{c2}(0) is significantly enhanced in the two gap dirty limit superconductor model:

\[H_{c2}(0)=\frac{\phi_{b}k_{B}T_{c}}{1.12\hbar\,\sqrt{D_{1}D_{2}}}\exp\left(\frac {g}{2}\right),\] (13)

as compared to the one-gap dirty limit approximation H_{c2}(0)\!=\!\phi_{b}k_{B}T_{c}/1.12\hbar D. Here g is a rather complicated function of the matrix of the BCS superconducting coupling constants.

In the limit of D_{2}\!\ll\!D_{1} we can simply approximate g\!=\!\left|\ln(D_{2}/D_{1})\right|. The large ratio of D_{2}/D_{1} leads to the enhancement of H_{c2}(0) and results in the upward curvature of the H_{c2}(T) close to T\!\!=\!0.[45] According to our \lambda(T) data (see above), we found very different diffusivities for p- and d-bands: D_{p}/D_{d}\!=\!3. Thus we can speculate that the limiting value of H_{c2}(0) is dominated by d-band with lower diffusivity D_{d}\!=\!17 cm^{2}/s, while the derivative dH_{c2}/dT close to T_{c} is due to larger diffusivity band (D_{p}\!=\!56 cm^{2}/s). Indeed, simple estimation of D_{p}\!=\!4\phi_{b}k_{B}/\pi^{2}\hbar(dH_{c2}/dT)\!=\!40 cm^{2}/s from a derivative dH_{c2}/dT\!=\!0.027T/K close to T_{c} gives almost the same diffusivity relative to one estimated from \lambda(T) for the p-band. Thus we believe that the two gap theoretical model of Gurevich qualitatively explains the unconventional linear H_{c2}(T) dependence, which supports our conclusion about the two gap nature of superconductivity in ZrB_{12}.

The possibility of the multigap nature of the superconducting state was predicted for a multiband superconductor with large difference of the e-p interaction at different FS sheets (see Ref. [24] and references therein). To date MgB_{2} has been the only compound with the behavior consistent with the idea of two distinct gaps with the same T_{c}. We believe that our data can add ZrB_{12} as another unconventional example of multigap and multi-T_{c} superconductor. This conclusion contradicts several existing publications, however, we believe we can successfully defend our idea.

The H_{c2}(T) dependence of ZrB_{12} single crystals from the same Kiev group has been measured by three different groups mentioned above and are plotted in Fig. 10. Clearly, our H_{c2}(T) data are very similar to those obtained by Daghero _et al.[21]_ (straight crosses). The agreement is nearly perfect except the last data point at 1.8 K. The disagreement is in the interpretation. The authors of Ref. [21] concluded that ZrB_{12} is a conventional one gap s-wave superconductor with \Delta(0)\!=\!1.22 meV. Thus a strong coupling scenario with reduced energy gap of 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\!=\!4.8 was proposed. One should note, however, that the gap signature in PCS data has been observed in a temperature range close to T_{c}(4.2\!-\!6 K), although the second gap signature feature should have been seen below T_{c}^{\rm q}\!=\!4.35 K, and could have been simply missed by the authors of Ref. [21] because of the limited temperature range of their measurements.

There is nearly a two times difference between H_{c2}(T) obtained from tunneling and magnetic characterization data of Tsindlekht _et al.[22]_ The same can be said about H_{c2}(T) obtained from C(H) and \rho(H) data of Lortz _et al.[19]_ and Wang _et al.[23]_ Tsindlekht _et al._ concluded that ZrB_{12} is a type-II superconductor with the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa slightly above the marginal value of 1/\sqrt{2}. At the same time Wang _et al.[23]_ observed a crossover between type-I and type-II behavior of C(H) at 4.7 K in contrast to our data. In all those approximations, the validity of the one gap BCS picture is implicitly assumed. Large contradiction between the \rho(H) and C(H) data (see Fig. 10) was attributed to surface superconductivity. One can mention another possible reason for this contradiction. In particular, data of Ref. [23] have been measured on the samples cut by a diamond saw without chemical etching of the surface damaged layer. This procedure may create a strong concentration gradient of boron in a surface layer and a substantial manifestation of the surface barriers for the flux lines resulting in this contradiction. One can also note that the discrepancies in H_{c2}(T) can be due to potentially large nonhomogeneity of the ZrB_{12} samples. Indeed, the Fig. 7 inset clearly demonstrates different transitions for our sample with no inclusions of ZrB_{2} and the sample cut from ZrB_{2} reaches part of an ingot (left line).

We believe that this inconsistency of our data and the data of Refs. [19] and [21]-[23] can be (i) due to the two gap nature of superconductivity in ZrB_{12}, (ii) due to large uncertainty in determining of the zero temperature gap from very narrow temperature range of the measurements, and (iii) last but not least due to potentially large nonhomogeneity of the ZrB_{12} samples that could have been used by those authors (see Fig. 2). Although observed two gap behavior of \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) in ZrB_{12} is similar to that in high-T_{c} superconductors, observation of two different T_{c} in these bands is unconventional. This also relates to the linear H_{c2}(T) dependence in the wide temperature range up to T_{c}. Striking two-gap BCS behavior observed calls certainly for a new study of low-T energy gap and H_{c}(T) of ZrB_{12} for understanding the nature of superconductivity in this cluster compound.

## VI Conclusions

We performed systematic study of the temperature and magnetic field dependencies of the resistivity, magnetic penetration depth, lower, H_{c1}(T), and upper, H_{c2}(T), critical magnetic fields of the single crystals dodecaboride ZrB_{12} and resistivity of diboride ZrB_{2}, as well as the magnetic penetration depth in thin films of MgB_{2}. While the temperature dependence of \lambda(T) in thin film MgB_{2} is well described by an isotropic single gap s-type order parameter, we find unconventional behavior of ZrB_{12} superfluid density with pronounced shoulder at T/T_{c} equal to 0.65. The H_{c2}(T) dependencies have been deduced from the \rho(H) and \lambda(H) data. Both techniques reveal an unconventional linear temperature dependence of H_{c2}(T), with a considerably low value of H_{c2}(0)\!=\!0.16 T. We conclude therefore that ZrB_{12} presents a evidence of the unconventional two-gap superconductivity with different \Delta and T_{c} in the different bands.
