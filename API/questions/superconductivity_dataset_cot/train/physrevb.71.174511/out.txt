###### Abstract

Magnetization measurements in the low-field region have been carefully performed on a well-shaped cylindrical and an ellipsoidal sample of superconductor MgCNi_{3}. Data from both samples show almost the same results. The lower critical field H_{c1} and the London penetration depth \lambda are thus derived. It is found that the result of normalized superfluid density \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) of MgCNi_{3} can be well described by BCS prediction with the expectation for an isotropic s-wave superconductivity.

## I Introduction

The pairing symmetry is very essential for uncovering the mechanism both for conventional and high-T_{c} superconductivity. The recently discovered intermetallic perovskite MgCNi_{3} superconductor [1] is regarded as a bridge between conventional superconductors and high-T_{c} cuprates, and the issue concerning its symmetry of order parameter has attracted considerable attention. However, pairing symmetry about MgCNi_{3} remains highly controversial in the literature. NMR, [2] specific heat, [3] scanning tunneling measurements, [4] point contact tunneling spectra [5] and density functional calculations [6, 7] favor the s-wave pairing in MgCNi_{3}. On the other hand, the theoretical calculation, [8] some tunneling spectra [9] and the penetration depth measurement [10] support non-s-wave superconductivity. Recently a two-band s-wave model has been proposed by Walte _et al._[11] who try to explain the complex behavior observed in MgCNi_{3}.

In this paper, we derive the thermodynamic parameters H_{c1} and \lambda of two MgCNi_{3} samples by careful magnetization measurement. It is found that the normalized superfluid density \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) can be described by BCS prediction for a s-wave pairing symmetry. Therefore, our magnetization data support the conventional single band s-wave superconductivity in MgCNi_{3}.

This paper is organized as follows. The samples and experimental details are presented in Sec. II. The data and discussions are given in Sec. III. Section IV gives the summary.

## II Samples and experimental details

The polycrystalline MgCNi_{3} sample investigated here has been prepared by powder metallurgy method, and the details of preparation can be found elsewhere. [12] The superconducting transition temperature is 6.9 K measured by both magnetization [ac susceptibility (f=333 Hz,H_{ac}=1 Oe) and dc diamagnetization shown in Fig. 1(a)] and resistivity measurement. The M(T) curves show a sharp transition with the transition width less than 0.5 K. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis presented in Fig. 1(b) shows that all diffraction peaks are from the MgCNi_{3} phase, which indicates that the sample is nearly of single phase.

In order to minimize the demagnetization factor, one sample (denoted as S-c) has been carefully cut and ground to a cylinder with a diameter of 1.1 mm and length of 7.0 mm. The demagnetization factor in this situation is almost negligible since the field has been applied along the axis of the cylinder. Another sample (denoted as S-e) has been polished to an ellipsoid with semimajor axis a=3.74 mm and semiminor axis b=1.5 mm. The demagnetization factor for the ellipsoidal sample is n=(1-1/e^{2})\{1-1/2e ln[(1+e)/(1-e)]\approx 0.136, with e=\sqrt{1-b^{2}/a^{2}}. The magnetic fields have been applied parallel to the longitudinal axis of the samples.

The magnetic measurements are mainly carried out on an Oxford cryogenic MagLab system (MagLab12Exa, with temperature down to 1.5 K) and checked by a quantum design superconducting interference device (SQUID, MPMS 5.5 T). After zero-field cooled (ZFC) from 25 K to a desired temperature, the magnetization curve M(H) is measured with the applied magnetic field swept slowly up to 1000 Oe

 (\gg_H_{c1}_). It is important to note that the magnet has been degaussed at T = 25 K in order to eliminate the remanent field before each measurement. It is essential to do degaussing since otherwise even 5 Oe residual field may cause significant effect on the result of magnetization.

## III Experimental data and discussions

In this section, the processes to obtain the superconducting parameters by magnetization measurement have been reported in detail for two MgCNi_{3} samples, one is a cylinder and another is an ellipsoid.

### The cylindrical sample (S-c)

The curves of dc magnetization are shown in Fig. 2. The temperature varies between 1.57 and 6.88 K with steps 0.2 K (some 0.4 K). All curves clearly show the common linear dependence of the magnetization on field caused by Meissner effect at low fields, and this extrapolated common line is the so-called "Meissner line" (ML). The optimal ML (solid line in Fig. 2) is achieved by doing linear fit M(H) of the lowest temperature (1.57 K) at low fields, which represents the magnetization curve of Meissner state. The value of _H_{c1}_ is determined by examining the point of departure from linearity on the initial slope of the magnetization curve (ML) with a certain criterion. The results of subtracting this ML from magnetization curves are plotted in Fig. 3 and the \Delta M between 7.0\times 10^{-4} and 1.4\times 10^{-3} emu are shown in the inset with an enlarged view. All curves show a fast drop to the resolution of device when the real _H_{c1}_ is approached, so the value of _H_{c1}_ is easily obtained by choosing a proper criterion of \Delta M. The _H_{c1}(T)_ acquired by using criteria of \Delta M = 7.0 \times 10^{-4} and 1.1\times 10^{-3} emu are shown in Fig. 4. Then the penetration depth \lambda(T) can be achieved from _H_{c1}(T)_ by

\[H_{c1}=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{4\pi\lambda^{2}}\ln\kappa\] (1)

and they are displayed in the inset of Fig. 4. Here \Phi_{0} = _hc_/2e = 2 \times 10^{-7} G cm^{2} is the flux quantum and \kappa is the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. We take \kappa as constant since it is a weakly temperature-dependent parameter.

The values of nominal _H_{c1}_ and \lambda seem to be criterion dependent in this method, however, temperature dependence of _H_{c1}_ and \lambda(T) are found to be weakly criterion dependent if the data are normalized by the zero temperature values [see \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) in Fig. 5]. In addition, \Delta M drops sharply with decreasing magnetic field, the use of lower \Delta M value in our criterion will not result in a much different _H_{c1}(T)_ curve. If not specially mentioned, the discussion is based on the data using the criterion of 7.0\times 10^{-4} emu hereinafter. At the temperatures below 2.8 K (<0.4 _T_{c}_), the values of _H_{c1}(T)_ and \lambda(T) are almost constant despite the lack of the data below 1.5 K. This may imply the conventional s-wave nature in MgCNi_{3}, because the finite energy gap manifests itself with an exponentially activated temperature dependence of thermodynamic parameters. This can be further confirmed in the following discussion on superfluid density. It is worth noting that it is very difficult to distinguish a slight difference of _H_{c1}_ (or 1/\lambda^{2}) in the low-temperature region between different pairing symmetries, for example, for an ideal s-wave, an exponential dependence is anticipated, for a dirty d wave, a quadratic form \rho_{s}(T) = \rho_{s}(0) - \alpha T^{2} is expected. Here we use

Error bars are given for determining the nominal _H_{c1}_ and \lambda. Lines are guides to the eyes.

  an alternative way, i.e., to fit the data in intermediate and high-temperature region to extract useful message for pairing symmetry.

As we know, the total superfluid density \rho_{s} is proportional to \lambda^{-2}(T), and \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) represents the normalized superfluid density. In Fig. 5, we display the temperature dependence of \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) of MgCNi_{3} with \lambda(0) as a fit parameter. The predictions of BCS s-wave (dashed) and two-fluid model (dotted) are also shown. According to the BCS theory for clean superconductors,[13, 14] the normalized superfluid density \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) is expressed as follows:

\[\frac{\lambda^{2}(0)}{\lambda^{2}(T)}=1-2\int_{\Delta(T)}^{\infty}\left(-\frac {\partial f(E)}{\partial E}\right)D(E)dE,\] (2)

where \Delta(T) is the BCS superconducting energy gap, f(E)=1/[\exp(-E/k_{B}T)+1] is the Fermi distribution function, and D(E)=E/[E^{2}-\Delta^{2}(T)]^{1/2} is the quasiparticle density of states. The most appropriate superconducting gap \Delta(0)=1.86k_{B}T_{c} is chosen in our BCS calculation with T_{c}=6.9 K, and this value is reasonable for MgCNi_{3} because the generally reported results are larger than the conventional BCS value (1.76k_{B}T_{c}). It is found that \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) of MgCNi_{3} can be well described by the s-wave BCS theory with a single gap, but the two-fluid model shows a substantial deviation. This suggests the s-wave nature of superconductivity in MgCNi_{3}, which is consistent with our previous conclusion reached by point-contact tunneling.[5] Later on we will show that our results are not compatible with any other pairing symmetry with nodes on the gap function which normally contributes a power law dependence to the temperature dependence \rho_{s}.

For the sake of comparison, the temperature dependence of the normalized superfluid density in MgB_{2} obtained by exactly the same magnetization method[15] is also shown in Fig. 5, with \lambda(0) as a fit parameter. Clearly the data cannot be understood in isotropic s-wave BCS theory or two-fluid model because of the two-gap characteristic of MgB_{2}.[16, 17] The data obtained from this simple magnetization method on MgB_{2} were found to be close to that determined by more elegant microwave method[18] and radio frequency technique,[19] which can be seen from Fig. 5. This indicates that the same magnetization method used in MgCNi_{3} to get H_{c1} and \lambda is reliable, and the corresponding results are plausible.

One may argue whether the H_{c1} obtained here is the lower critical field of grains because of the polycrystalline nature of our sample. In our magnetization experiment, the nominal H_{c1}(0) of our sample is about 145.1 Oe. Combined with H_{c2}(0) (1.18\times 10^{5} Oe) determined from our previous measurement of specific heat,[20] we can reach that the value of \kappa is 39 and H_{c}(0) equals to 2165 Oe by Eqs. (3) and (4). The value of coherence length is 5.3 nm obtained by Eq. (5).

\[H_{c1}(T)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}H_{c}(T)\frac{1}{\kappa}\ln\kappa,\] (3)

\[H_{c2}(T)=\sqrt{2}H_{c}(T)\kappa,\] (4)

\[\xi(0)=\sqrt{\Phi_{0}/2\pi H_{c2}(0)}.\] (5)

The value of \lambda(0) is about 200.1 nm. All these values of parameters are in the range of the reported results of MgCNi_{3} by other techniques  

### The ellipsoidal sample (S-e)

The curves of dc magnetization are shown in Fig. 6 and the temperature varies between 1.59 and 6.90 K with steps about 0.1 K. The optimal "Meissner line" (solid line in Fig. 6) has been determined in the same way as for the cylindrical sample. Subtracting this ML from the magnetization data yields the \Delta M curves plotted in Fig. 7. The H_{c1}(T) acquired by using criteria of \Delta M = 3.2 \times 10^{-4} and 1.0 \times 10^{-3} emu are shown in Fig. 8, and the demagnetization factor n (\approx0.136) has been taken into account. Then the penetration depth \lambda(T) can be achieved from Eq. (1) and they are displayed in the inset of Fig. 8. The normalized temperature dependence of \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) of MgCNi_{3} is shown in Fig. 9. One can clearly see that the data from the ellipsoidal sample are almost identical to that for the cylindrical sample, showing a trivial influence of either the geometrical or surface barrier in our present samples.

In addition, we have calculated the superfluid density assuming a nodal gap with d-wave symmetry. Under the frame of the BCS theory, if the gap has a d-wave-like node, the normalized superfluid density \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) is written as

\[\frac{\lambda^{2}(0)}{\lambda^{2}(T)}=1-\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{ \Delta(T,\theta)}^{\infty}-\frac{\partial f(E)}{\partial E}D(E)dEd\theta\] (6)

with f(E) = 1/[\exp(-E/k_{B}T) + 1], \Delta(T,\theta) = \Delta_{0}(T)\cos 2\theta and D(E) = E\{E^{2} - \lambda^{2}(T,\theta)\}[12]. The calculated d-wave results are shown in Fig. 9 with dashed line. For p_{x}-wave symmetry with \Delta(T,\theta) = \Delta_{0}(T)\sin\theta, we found that the calculated temperature dependence of \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) is close to that of a d-wave, and far from our experiment data. The predictions of s-wave BCS (solid) and two-fluid model (dotted) are also shown in Fig. 9. It is found that our data can only be well described by the s-wave model. Together with the results for the cylindrical sample, we conclude that MgCNi_{3} is most likely an isotropic s-wave superconductor.

## IV Summary

To summarize, we have measured the M-H curves of two MgCNi_{3} samples with cylindrical and ellipsoidal shapes and obtained their lower critical field H_{c1}(T) and \lambda(T). The temperature dependence of normalized superfluid density is consistent with the s-wave BCS theory. All these indicate that MgCNi_{3} may possess an isotropic s-wave gap, which is in sharp contrast to MgB_{2}.

_Note added._ The recent report of carbon isotope effect in MgCNi_{3} by T. Klimczuk and R. J. Cava indicates that carbon-based phonons play an essential role in the superconducting mechanism.[21]

## I Introduction

The pairing symmetry is very essential for uncovering the mechanism both for conventional and high-T_{c} superconductivity. The recently discovered intermetallic perovskite MgCNi_{3} superconductor [1] is regarded as a bridge between conventional superconductors and high-T_{c} cuprates, and the issue concerning its symmetry of order parameter has attracted considerable attention. However, pairing symmetry about MgCNi_{3} remains highly controversial in the literature. NMR, [2] specific heat, [3] scanning tunneling measurements, [4] point contact tunneling spectra [5] and density functional calculations [6, 7] favor the s-wave pairing in MgCNi_{3}. On the other hand, the theoretical calculation, [8] some tunneling spectra [9] and the penetration depth measurement [10] support non-s-wave superconductivity. Recently a two-band s-wave model has been proposed by Walte _et al._[11] who try to explain the complex behavior observed in MgCNi_{3}.

In this paper, we derive the thermodynamic parameters H_{c1} and \lambda of two MgCNi_{3} samples by careful magnetization measurement. It is found that the normalized superfluid density \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) can be described by BCS prediction for a s-wave pairing symmetry. Therefore, our magnetization data support the conventional single band s-wave superconductivity in MgCNi_{3}.

This paper is organized as follows. The samples and experimental details are presented in Sec. II. The data and discussions are given in Sec. III. Section IV gives the summary.

## II Samples and experimental details

The polycrystalline MgCNi_{3} sample investigated here has been prepared by powder metallurgy method, and the details of preparation can be found elsewhere. [12] The superconducting transition temperature is 6.9 K measured by both magnetization [ac susceptibility (f=333 Hz,H_{ac}=1 Oe) and dc diamagnetization shown in Fig. 1(a)] and resistivity measurement. The M(T) curves show a sharp transition with the transition width less than 0.5 K. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis presented in Fig. 1(b) shows that all diffraction peaks are from the MgCNi_{3} phase, which indicates that the sample is nearly of single phase.

In order to minimize the demagnetization factor, one sample (denoted as S-c) has been carefully cut and ground to a cylinder with a diameter of 1.1 mm and length of 7.0 mm. The demagnetization factor in this situation is almost negligible since the field has been applied along the axis of the cylinder. Another sample (denoted as S-e) has been polished to an ellipsoid with semimajor axis a=3.74 mm and semiminor axis b=1.5 mm. The demagnetization factor for the ellipsoidal sample is n=(1-1/e^{2})\{1-1/2e ln[(1+e)/(1-e)]\approx 0.136, with e=\sqrt{1-b^{2}/a^{2}}. The magnetic fields have been applied parallel to the longitudinal axis of the samples.

The magnetic measurements are mainly carried out on an Oxford cryogenic MagLab system (MagLab12Exa, with temperature down to 1.5 K) and checked by a quantum design superconducting interference device (SQUID, MPMS 5.5 T). After zero-field cooled (ZFC) from 25 K to a desired temperature, the magnetization curve M(H) is measured with the applied magnetic field swept slowly up to 1000 Oe

 (\gg_H_{c1}_). It is important to note that the magnet has been degaussed at T = 25 K in order to eliminate the remanent field before each measurement. It is essential to do degaussing since otherwise even 5 Oe residual field may cause significant effect on the result of magnetization.

## III Experimental data and discussions

In this section, the processes to obtain the superconducting parameters by magnetization measurement have been reported in detail for two MgCNi_{3} samples, one is a cylinder and another is an ellipsoid.

### The cylindrical sample (S-c)

The curves of dc magnetization are shown in Fig. 2. The temperature varies between 1.57 and 6.88 K with steps 0.2 K (some 0.4 K). All curves clearly show the common linear dependence of the magnetization on field caused by Meissner effect at low fields, and this extrapolated common line is the so-called "Meissner line" (ML). The optimal ML (solid line in Fig. 2) is achieved by doing linear fit M(H) of the lowest temperature (1.57 K) at low fields, which represents the magnetization curve of Meissner state. The value of _H_{c1}_ is determined by examining the point of departure from linearity on the initial slope of the magnetization curve (ML) with a certain criterion. The results of subtracting this ML from magnetization curves are plotted in Fig. 3 and the \Delta M between 7.0\times 10^{-4} and 1.4\times 10^{-3} emu are shown in the inset with an enlarged view. All curves show a fast drop to the resolution of device when the real _H_{c1}_ is approached, so the value of _H_{c1}_ is easily obtained by choosing a proper criterion of \Delta M. The _H_{c1}(T)_ acquired by using criteria of \Delta M = 7.0 \times 10^{-4} and 1.1\times 10^{-3} emu are shown in Fig. 4. Then the penetration depth \lambda(T) can be achieved from _H_{c1}(T)_ by

\[H_{c1}=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{4\pi\lambda^{2}}\ln\kappa\] (1)

and they are displayed in the inset of Fig. 4. Here \Phi_{0} = _hc_/2e = 2 \times 10^{-7} G cm^{2} is the flux quantum and \kappa is the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. We take \kappa as constant since it is a weakly temperature-dependent parameter.

The values of nominal _H_{c1}_ and \lambda seem to be criterion dependent in this method, however, temperature dependence of _H_{c1}_ and \lambda(T) are found to be weakly criterion dependent if the data are normalized by the zero temperature values [see \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) in Fig. 5]. In addition, \Delta M drops sharply with decreasing magnetic field, the use of lower \Delta M value in our criterion will not result in a much different _H_{c1}(T)_ curve. If not specially mentioned, the discussion is based on the data using the criterion of 7.0\times 10^{-4} emu hereinafter. At the temperatures below 2.8 K (<0.4 _T_{c}_), the values of _H_{c1}(T)_ and \lambda(T) are almost constant despite the lack of the data below 1.5 K. This may imply the conventional s-wave nature in MgCNi_{3}, because the finite energy gap manifests itself with an exponentially activated temperature dependence of thermodynamic parameters. This can be further confirmed in the following discussion on superfluid density. It is worth noting that it is very difficult to distinguish a slight difference of _H_{c1}_ (or 1/\lambda^{2}) in the low-temperature region between different pairing symmetries, for example, for an ideal s-wave, an exponential dependence is anticipated, for a dirty d wave, a quadratic form \rho_{s}(T) = \rho_{s}(0) - \alpha T^{2} is expected. Here we use

  an alternative way, i.e., to fit the data in intermediate and high-temperature region to extract useful message for pairing symmetry.

As we know, the total superfluid density \rho_{s} is proportional to \lambda^{-2}(T), and \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) represents the normalized superfluid density. In Fig. 5, we display the temperature dependence of \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) of MgCNi_{3} with \lambda(0) as a fit parameter. The predictions of BCS s-wave (dashed) and two-fluid model (dotted) are also shown. According to the BCS theory for clean superconductors,[13, 14] the normalized superfluid density \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) is expressed as follows:

\[\frac{\lambda^{2}(0)}{\lambda^{2}(T)}=1-2\int_{\Delta(T)}^{\infty}\left(-\frac {\partial f(E)}{\partial E}\right)D(E)dE,\] (2)

where \Delta(T) is the BCS superconducting energy gap, f(E)=1/[\exp(-E/k_{B}T)+1] is the Fermi distribution function, and D(E)=E/[E^{2}-\Delta^{2}(T)]^{1/2} is the quasiparticle density of states. The most appropriate superconducting gap \Delta(0)=1.86k_{B}T_{c} is chosen in our BCS calculation with T_{c}=6.9 K, and this value is reasonable for MgCNi_{3} because the generally reported results are larger than the conventional BCS value (1.76k_{B}T_{c}). It is found that \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) of MgCNi_{3} can be well described by the s-wave BCS theory with a single gap, but the two-fluid model shows a substantial deviation. This suggests the s-wave nature of superconductivity in MgCNi_{3}, which is consistent with our previous conclusion reached by point-contact tunneling.[5] Later on we will show that our results are not compatible with any other pairing symmetry with nodes on the gap function which normally contributes a power law dependence to the temperature dependence \rho_{s}.

For the sake of comparison, the temperature dependence of the normalized superfluid density in MgB_{2} obtained by exactly the same magnetization method[15] is also shown in Fig. 5, with \lambda(0) as a fit parameter. Clearly the data cannot be understood in isotropic s-wave BCS theory or two-fluid model because of the two-gap characteristic of MgB_{2}.[16, 17] The data obtained from this simple magnetization method on MgB_{2} were found to be close to that determined by more elegant microwave method[18] and radio frequency technique,[19] which can be seen from Fig. 5. This indicates that the same magnetization method used in MgCNi_{3} to get H_{c1} and \lambda is reliable, and the corresponding results are plausible.

One may argue whether the H_{c1} obtained here is the lower critical field of grains because of the polycrystalline nature of our sample. In our magnetization experiment, the nominal H_{c1}(0) of our sample is about 145.1 Oe. Combined with H_{c2}(0) (1.18\times 10^{5} Oe) determined from our previous measurement of specific heat,[20] we can reach that the value of \kappa is 39 and H_{c}(0) equals to 2165 Oe by Eqs. (3) and (4). The value of coherence length is 5.3 nm obtained by Eq. (5).

\[H_{c1}(T)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}H_{c}(T)\frac{1}{\kappa}\ln\kappa,\] (3)

\[H_{c2}(T)=\sqrt{2}H_{c}(T)\kappa,\] (4)

\[\xi(0)=\sqrt{\Phi_{0}/2\pi H_{c2}(0)}.\] (5)

The value of \lambda(0) is about 200.1 nm. All these values of parameters are in the range of the reported results of MgCNi_{3} by other techniques  

### The ellipsoidal sample (S-e)

The curves of dc magnetization are shown in Fig. 6 and the temperature varies between 1.59 and 6.90 K with steps about 0.1 K. The optimal "Meissner line" (solid line in Fig. 6) has been determined in the same way as for the cylindrical sample. Subtracting this ML from the magnetization data yields the \Delta M curves plotted in Fig. 7. The H_{c1}(T) acquired by using criteria of \Delta M = 3.2 \times 10^{-4} and 1.0 \times 10^{-3} emu are shown in Fig. 8, and the demagnetization factor n (\approx0.136) has been taken into account. Then the penetration depth \lambda(T) can be achieved from Eq. (1) and they are displayed in the inset of Fig. 8. The normalized temperature dependence of \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) of MgCNi_{3} is shown in Fig. 9. One can clearly see that the data from the ellipsoidal sample are almost identical to that for the cylindrical sample, showing a trivial influence of either the geometrical or surface barrier in our present samples.

In addition, we have calculated the superfluid density assuming a nodal gap with d-wave symmetry. Under the frame of the BCS theory, if the gap has a d-wave-like node, the normalized superfluid density \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) is written as

\[\frac{\lambda^{2}(0)}{\lambda^{2}(T)}=1-\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{ \Delta(T,\theta)}^{\infty}-\frac{\partial f(E)}{\partial E}D(E)dEd\theta\] (6)

with f(E) = 1/[\exp(-E/k_{B}T) + 1], \Delta(T,\theta) = \Delta_{0}(T)\cos 2\theta and D(E) = E\{E^{2} - \lambda^{2}(T,\theta)\}[12]. The calculated d-wave results are shown in Fig. 9 with dashed line. For p_{x}-wave symmetry with \Delta(T,\theta) = \Delta_{0}(T)\sin\theta, we found that the calculated temperature dependence of \lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T) is close to that of a d-wave, and far from our experiment data. The predictions of s-wave BCS (solid) and two-fluid model (dotted) are also shown in Fig. 9. It is found that our data can only be well described by the s-wave model. Together with the results for the cylindrical sample, we conclude that MgCNi_{3} is most likely an isotropic s-wave superconductor.

## IV Summary

To summarize, we have measured the M-H curves of two MgCNi_{3} samples with cylindrical and ellipsoidal shapes and obtained their lower critical field H_{c1}(T) and \lambda(T). The temperature dependence of normalized superfluid density is consistent with the s-wave BCS theory. All these indicate that MgCNi_{3} may possess an isotropic s-wave gap, which is in sharp contrast to MgB_{2}.

_Note added._ The recent report of carbon isotope effect in MgCNi_{3} by T. Klimczuk and R. J. Cava indicates that carbon-based phonons play an essential role in the superconducting mechanism.[21]
