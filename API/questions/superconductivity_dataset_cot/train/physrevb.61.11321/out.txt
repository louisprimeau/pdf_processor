Many high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors (HTSC's) display an approximately parabolic dependence of T_{c} upon the hole concentration p with the maximum T_{c} at p \approx 0.16.1,2 (p is defined as the hole concentration per Cu atom in CuO2 planes.) This behavior was observed first in La2-3SrCuO4.1 Then other HTSC's, such as YBa2Cu3O7-,2 Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+_d_,3 and TlSr2CaCu2O7+_d_,1 were also found to show approximately the same relation between T_{c} and p which scales only with the maximum T_{c} , T_{c,max}. Though not studied for the full range of p, several other HTSC's are also known to have T_{c,\ max} at p \approx 0.14\sim 0.15.4,5 Therefore one might expect that there possibly exists a universal relation between T_{c} and p which all HTSC's satisfy.2

Footnote 1: T_{c}/T_{c,max} against p is plotted in Fig. 1(a).

Existence of a universal parabolic relation between T_{c} and p for all HTSC's, despite the different combinations of constituent atoms, the presence of various charge-carrier reservoir layers, and a variety of interplane coupling strengths, cannot be common but is believed to be related to a noble nature of high-temperature superconductivity. It is therefore not strange that the recent observations in Zn-doped HTSC's of departure from the universal relation have drawn particular interest.6-9 Much attention has focused on the function of Zn. Within a HTSC, Zn substitutes for Cu in the CuO2 plane and behaves as a nonmagnetic impurity without altering the carrier concentration. In this paper, we show that a similar nonuniversal T_{c}-p relation holds also for the La-doped Bi-2201 system, Bi2Sr2-LaCuO6+_d_, which contains strong disorders in CuO2 planes differing from impurities.

We have obtained the hole concentration p of the samples from the thermopower (S) measurements. The room-temperature thermopower S(290 K) of HTSC's was found to be a universal function of p over the whole range of doping,1,3 which has since been used widely to determine the p of HTSC's. The superconducting-transition temperature T_{c} was determined at half the normal-state resistivity. The conventional solid-state reaction of stoichiometric oxides and carbonates was adopted in preparing polycrystalline samples of Bi2Sr2-_{x}La2CuO6+_d_. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows all the samples to be single phase to the threshold of detection. The oxygen content in the sample of x = 0.1 could be varied by annealing the same sample in vacuum for 6 h at different temperatures (400 degC, 500 degC, and then 600 degC). S was measured by employing the dc method described in Ref. [10]. The resistivity \rho was measured through the conventional low-frequency ac four-probe method.

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependences of S and \rho of Bi2Sr2-_{x}La2CuO6+_d_ (BSLCO) with 0.1 \leqx \leq 0.8. The temperature and doping dependences of S in Fig. 1(a) are typical of HTSC's. S (290 K) increases with doping x from - 15.5 to 60 \muV/K. Corresponding p determined from the relations between S (290 K) and p in Ref. [3] varies from 0.286 to 0.073 with doping. The \rho measurements in Fig. 1(b) display that the T_{c} of BSLCO has its maximum at x \sim 0.5 or p \sim 0.22. The appearance of T_{c,max} at x \sim 0.5 agrees with the previous measurements.11T_{c}/T_{c,max} against p is plotted in

Figure 1: (a) The thermopower S and (b) the resistivity \rho of Bi2Sr2−_La2CuO6+_d_ as functions of temperature. The numbers next to the curves denote the La content x in the materials.

  Fig. 2. The T_{c} (=21.5 K) of x = 0.5 is used as T_{c,max} for solid circles. The dotted curve is of the "universal" relation, T_{c}/T_{c,max} = 1 - 82.6 (p - 0.16)2, in Ref. [1]. The relation has not yet been fully tested in the overdoped region of p > 0.25. Figure 2 clearly displays that BSLCO does not follow the systematics. Superconductivity in the underdoped region is deeply suppressed and the T_{c,max} appears at an overdoped hole concentration p \sim 0.22 rather than 0.16. Besides, the T_{c,max} of \sim 21.5 K is also unusually low, which is only \frac{1}{4} the T_{c} of Ti_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6+\delta}, isostructural of BSLCO.[12] Taking the maximum T_{c} of Ti_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} as T_{c,max}, BSLCO has much lower T_{c}/T_{c,max}'s, as represented by open circles in Fig. 2.

Unusual T_{c} variation with p is exposed more dramatically in the vacuum-annealed sample of x = 0.1 which superconducts at T \ll 10 K without being vacuum annealed. Vacuum annealing reduces the content of oxygen atoms interstitial between Bi-O planes and consequently p in CuO_{2} planes.[13, 14, 15] Figure 3(a) shows that successive vacuum annealings at 400 ^{\circ}C, 500 ^{\circ}C, and then 600 ^{\circ}C enhance S of Bi_{2}Sr_{1.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{6+\delta} from - 15.5 to - 9.3 \muV/K. The corresponding variation of p is from 0.286 to 0.240. We expect from the observed T_{c}-p relation of BSLCO in Fig. 2 that T_{c} of the sample of x = 0.1 rises with annealing from 10 to 20 K. The \rho measurements in Fig. 3(b), however, show that the superconductivity observed in the as-grown sample disappears with annealing in vacuum. We observed similar behaviors also in Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} which had been prepared from the nominal composition of Bi:Sr:Cu=2.2:1.5. The semiconducting as-grown sample of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} having p = 0.282 exhibited a superconducting-transition onset at 11.5 K when vacuum annealed at 400 ^{\circ}C. And yet subsequent vacuum annealings at 500 and 600 ^{\circ}C put the sample back in the semiconducting states. The p's of the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} sample annealed at 400, 500, and 600 ^{\circ}C were 0.256, 0.250, and 0.216, respectively, all of which are located in the superconducting region of Fig. 2.

The T_{c} vs p characteristics of as-grown samples represented by the open circles in Fig. 2 resemble those of Zn-doped HTSC's in Refs. [6] and [7]. It has been suggested that the primary effect of Zn impurities is to produce a large residual resistivity as a nonmagnetic potential scatterer in the unitary limit and that the more rapid depression of T_{c} in the underdoped region is related to the large residual resistivity reaching the universal two-dimensional resistance h/4e^{2}\approx 6.5 k\Omega/\square per CuO_{2} plane at the edge of the underdoped superconducting region.[8] Unlike most HTSC's, the Bi-2201 superconductor is found to have an exceptionally large residual resistivity.[16, 17] The corresponding two-dimensional residual resistance per CuO_{2} plane ranges from 0.3 k\Omega/\square at an overdoped hole concentration to 10 k\Omega/\square at an underdoped concentration with 50% uncertainties.[18] The large residual resistivity indicates that BSLCO contains strong scatterers of charge carriers in the planes. The strong scatterer in BSLCO is, however, not an impurity but most likely a vacancy in the Cu site, since any of Bi, Sr, and La can hardly substitute for Cu and disorders in the noncopper sites have little effect on superconducting properties but changing the hole concentration. Nevertheless, a vacancy in the CuO_{2} plane is expected to act as a nonmagnetic potential scatterer, just like the Zn impurity in the planes. Vacuum annealing may cause extra vacancies in CuO_{2} planes as well as expelling interstitial oxygen atoms. Thus the same argument in terms of disorder in the CuO_{2} plane can be adopted for an explanation of the deeper suppression of T_{c} in vacuum-annealed samples.

Although the above discussion does not provide a full account for the origin of the nonuniversal T_{c} vs p characteristics, it may be concluded that similarity between the Bi

Figure 2: T_{c} of Bi_{2.3}Sr_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{6+\delta}, normalized to T_{c,max} , plotted as a function of the hole concentration p determined from the S data in Fig. 1 and the S-p relations in Ref. [1]. T_{c,max} = 21.5 K for closed circles and 85 K for open circles. The error bars show the upper limit of T_{c} for the sample of x = 0.8 with p = 0.098. The dotted curve is a plot of the “universal” relation in Ref. [1].

  2201 HTSC with disorders differing from impurities and other HTSC's with Zn impurities seem to strengthen the argument that a strong potential scattering in the planes and a large residual resistivity at an underdoped hole concentration are closely related to the strong suppression of high-temperature superconductivity and the more rapid T_{c} depression in the underdoped region.
