###### Abstract

ZrB₂ is a nonsuperconducting Pauli paramagnetic crystallizing in the
AlB₂ structure. V substitution for Zr in Zr_(1 − x)V,B₂ (0.01  ≤ x≤ 0.1)
at the few percentage level induces superconductivity with critical
temperature reaching a maximum of 8.7 K for Zr_(0.96)V_(0.04)B₂ near the
solid solubility limit. Specific-heat and lower critical field
temperature dependence results suggest the possibility of unconventional
superconductivity possibly arising from multiband effects.

## I Introduction

The first superconductors found in the AlB₂ structure were
off-stoichiometry NbB₂ and MoB₂ with a respective T_(c) of 3.87 and 7.45
K.¹ NbB₂ has a wide boron stoichiometry range, its excess B
stoichiometry presumably arising from a defect structure. A recent
systematic study of Nunes _et al._ of the B-solubility in NbB₂, where
the homogeneity of the phases obtained was determined by neutron
diffraction, confirmed the maximum critical temperature of 3.9 K.² This
study raises again the question of the nature of defects in these
compounds. NbB₂ spans a wide range of composition as shown in the
diagram in Fig. 1.³

It appears that the Nb-B interatomic distance in NbB₂ across its
stoichiometric range remains constant at 2.43 A. A superstructure of
vacancy defects in the crystal lattice has been proposed to explain the
wide stability range of NbB₂.⁴ This defect structure is based on a
balance of the cohesive forces in the B layers and the expansive forces
in the Nb layers. Certainly this defect structure strongly influences
the electronic structure, making it highly dependent on stoichiometry.

The discovery of superconductivity in MgB₂ with superconducting critical
temperature close to 40 K⁵ has renewed interest in AlB₂ structure
materials, particularly as candidates for multiband superconductivity.
MoB₂ was reviewed by Muzzy _et al_. who reported a systematic study of
the substitution of Mo by Zr in the (Mo_(0.96)Zr_(0.04))_(0.88)B₂ where
the AlB₂ structure is stabilized and superconductivity can exist with
critical temperature between 5.9 and 8.2 K.⁶ These authors claim that
the superconductivity is strongly dependent on a specific defect
structure similar to the one that occurs in NbB₂. Another interesting
case is CaSi₂, which at 15 GPa undergoes an allotropic transformation
into the AlB₂ structure with a superconducting critical temperature
close to 14.0 K.⁷ Although many metal diborides can crystallize in the
AlB₂-type structure, superconductivity in this class of material is
relatively rare. Theoretical studies suggest that some member compounds
are good candidates to exhibit a high superconducting critical
temperature. Among these suggested compounds are AuB₂, AgB₂, LiB₂, ZnB₂,
and CaB₂.⁸ ⁻ ¹² However, these theoretical predictions have not been
confirmed, and some of the suggested compounds do not exist in the
equilibrium phase diagram, for example, ZnB₂, which does not exist on
the Zn-B thermodynamic equilibrium binary system. In the binary Zn-B
system no solubility exists between Zn and B atoms, and no intermetallic
phase is observed. In our opinion the most important criterion for
superconductivity in the AlB₂-type structure is defect creation such as
occurs in NbB₂. Superconductivity was reported in ZrB₂ with
superconducting critical temperature close to 5.5 K.¹⁵ However, this
surprising result was not confirmed by other groups. In fact, single
crystals of this compound (ZrB₂) are not superconducting.¹⁴ The Zr-B
phase diagram suggests that contamination with ZrB₁₂, a known
superconductor with critical temperature 5.94 K.¹⁵ ZrB₂, also was
studied to high pressure (50 GPa) and no superconductivity was
observed.¹⁶

In this work we present a systematic study of substitution of Zr for V
in Zr_(1 − x)V_(x)B₂ (0  ≤ x≤ 1.0) and find that superconductivity
emerge in the nonsuperconductor ZrB₂ matrix for a small content of V, an
example where an extremely stressed lattice of the AlB₂ prototype yields
superconductivity while the matrix compound is nonsuperconducting. The
specific-heat results reveal unambiguously that the Zr_(0.96)V_(0.04)B₂
composition is a bulk superconductor with critical temperature close to
8.7 K. Our results suggest that at the limit of stability of the V-doped
ZrB₂ the superconducting critical temperature is optimized.

## II Experimental

Polycrystalline Zr_(1 − x)V_(x)B₂ samples were prepared from high-purity
elements with x values of 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.1,
and 0.2. The constituent elements were melted in an arc furnace on a
water-cooled Cu hearth with Ti getter under high-purity argon. The
samples were flipped and remelted five times to ensure good homogeneity.
Due to low vapor pressures of the constituent elements at their melting
temperatures, the weight losses during arc melting were negligible (≤
0.5

Magnetic, electric, and thermal initial characterizations were made
using a Quantum Design PPMS Evercool II. Magnetization (_M_)
measurements were obtained with a vibrating sample measurement system in
a DC external field at 50 Oe with both zero field cooling and field
cooling regimes, in the temperature (_T_) range from 2 to 20 K. The
hysteresis loops of the M versus applied magnetic field (_H_) curves
were obtained at 2 K in the range −500 ≤ μ₀H ≤ 500 Oe. Electrical
transport measurements were done using the conventional four-point
method, with a probe current of 1000 μA. The superconducting critical
temperature (_T_c) was defined as the transition midpoint. The
electrical resistivity (ρ) versus T curve was obtained in the
temperature range from 2.0 to 300 K. The magnetoresistance was obtained
for an applied magnetic field in the range 0 ≤ μ₀H ≤ 11.5 T. The
specific heat of a piece of material cut from the sample was measured in
the range 2.0-10.0 K with a calorimeter in PPMS Evercool II (Quantum
Design) using the relaxation method.

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 2 shows the diffractometry pattern sequence of arc-melted
ZrI_(1 − x)V_(x)B₂ samples with x from 0.01 to 0.1. All reflections can
be indexed as an AlB₂ structure (see inset of Fig. 2), space group
_P6/mmm_, where the Zr atoms occupy the _la_ (0,0,0) positions and B
atoms the 2d (1/3,2/3,1/2). Indeed, the lattice parameters as a function
of V content reveal a small but consistent variation, indicating that
the c̄ lattice parameter systematically decreases with the substitution
of Zr for V as shown in Fig. 3. However, the ā lattice parameter is
essentially constant as a function of V content. These results are
consistent with the metallic radius of V relative to Zr and indicates
that V occupies the positions (0,0,0). A careful analysis of the
behavior of the c̄ lattice parameters suggests that the solubility limit
is low, lower than x = 0.05. In the XRD measurements of the samples with
composition x >= 0.7, a very small segregation of a secondary phase (VB)
was observed.

The substitution of Zr by V yields a contraction in the Zr layers in the
AlB₂ prototype structure. This is expected since ā and c̄ parameters are
approximately 5

range of the NbB₂ phase. Adapted from Ref. 3.

polycrystalline samples ZrI_(1 − x)V_(x)B₂ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.1). In the inset a
AlB₂ structure unit cell is shown, where the blue spheres represent Zr
atoms and yellow the B atoms.

These differences explain the larger variation observed for the c̃
lattice parameter compared to that of the ã lattice parameter. The
contraction in the lattice parameters occurs until x ∼ 0.05 in
composition, indicating a very limited solubility.

The temperature dependence of the magnetization is shown in Fig. 4. One
observes that a superconducting transition emerges even at very low
substitution of Zr by V at 6.4 K (x = 0.01). In the inset, the M vs H
curve at 2 K, characteristic type II superconducting behavior is seen.

These results are especially interesting because they suggest that the V
can radically affects the electronic structure of ZrB₂, inducing
superconductivity in the nonsuperconducting matrix. Indeed for x = 0.04
the superconducting critical temperature reaches the maximum value close
to 8.7 K as shown in Fig. 5. The dependence of magnetization with the
applied magnetic field at 2.0 K is shown as typical type II behavior in
the inset of this figure. For compositions higher than x = 0.04 the
critical temperature decreases slightly, consistent with the solubility
limit. For example, the composition Zr_(0.95)V_(0.05)B₂ sample, T_(c) is
close to 8.2 K. Figure 6 shows the dependence of the critical
temperature on the function of V content up to the solubility limit. In
samples beyond x = 0.05 the critical temperature remains at 8.2 K. M(T)
measurements show that the critical temperature does not change with
higher V content, but the normalized magnetic moment value (emu/g) at 2
K is reduced, suggesting a decrease of the superconducting fraction and
consistent with the appearance of a secondary phase. Thus, these results
find the optimal level for superconductivity for Zr_(0.96)V_(0.04)B₂.

Figure 7 shows a SEM micrograph for compositions x = 0.04 (a) and 0.05
(b), obtained using the same magnification (300×). It is observed that
the microstructure of the x = 0.04 sample is uniform and is constituted
of a single phase. Indeed, the EDS analysis reveals that the x = 0.04
nominal composition is preserved in all grains. However, at x = 0.05 a
very small segregation can be observed in the grain boundary; this is
consistent with the lattice parameter analysis. The difference of grain
size in the x = 0.04 (a) and 0.05 (b) samples can be explained by Zener
pinning effects, where the small segregation acts as a barrier in the
grain

boundary motion. Since the Zr_(0.96)V_(0.04)B₂ sample presents the
highest superconducting temperature, we will discuss in more detail this
composition. The temperature dependence of the resistivity for the
Zr_(0.96)V_(0.04)B₂ sample is shown in Fig. 8. A sharp resistivity
transition close to 8.7 K (onset temperature) is clearly observed in
Fig. 8(a), indicative of the good quality of the sample. This result is
consistent with magnetization results displayed in Fig. 5. The
temperature dependence of the normalized resistivity obtained for an
applied magnetic field in the range 0 ≤ μ₀H ≤ 11.5 T is shown in Fig.
8(b). These results suggest that the upper critical field is quite high
since even in an applied magnetic field of μ₀H = 11.5 T the material is
still superconducting with critical temperature close to 4.5 K. A
estimate of the upper critical field in 0 K [μ₀H_(c2)(0)] can be made
through the Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg (WHH) formula,[18] in the
limit of a short electronic mean-free path (dirty limit) given by

μ₀ H_(c2)(0) = −0.693T_(c) (dH_(c2)/dT)_(T = Tc)
(1)

The temperature dependence of the upper critical field [μ₀H_(c2)(T)] is
shown in Fig. 9 where the red line represents the conventional fitting
with μ₀H_(c2)(0) obtained using the WHH formula [Eq. (1)]. The
μ₀H_(c2)(0) is estimated to be ∼16.3 T, a surprisingly high upper
critical field for this class of the material.[19] The fitting in Fig. 9
data allows an estimation of the coherence length through of the
Ginzburg-Landau formula:

μ₀H_(c2)(0) = ϕ₀/2πξ₀²,
(2)

where ϕ₀ is a quantum flux equal 2.068 × 10⁻¹⁵ T m⁻², which yields
ξ₀ ∼ 4.49 nm at 0 K. All these results are consistent with bulk
superconductivity in Zr_(0.96)V_(0.04)B₂.

The lower critical field (H_(c1)) can be estimated from the applied
magnetic field dependence of the magnetization at several temperatures
shown in Fig. 10(a), which gives μ₀H_(c1)(0) ∼ 2.5 mT. The values of
H_(c1) were determined by examining the point of departure from
linearity on the slope of the magnetization curve, using the criterion
of ΔM = 10⁻³ emu for the difference between the Meissner line and
magnetization signal,[20] as is shown in Fig. 10(b). However, the
dependence of the H_(c1) with the reduced temperature (t = T/T_(c))
reveals a negative curvature suggesting unconventional behavior (see
Fig. 11).

This kind of the unconventional behavior in H_(c1)(t) can be observed in
materials which are considered multiband compounds.[18; 20; 21] The
deviation is also observed in MgB₂, which is a superconductor with two
bands arising from the holelike boron σ band and the π band.[9; 22]
Hence, the two-band Eliashberg theory is generally taken as the
appropriate description rather than the isotropic single band model.[23;
24]

conventional fitting: μ₀H_(c2)(T) = μ₀H_(c2)(0)[1 − (T/T_(c))²].

The TB Eliashberg model was applied for determining the behavior of
H_(c2) in YNi₂B₂C and LuNi₂B₂C, and MgB₂.[23, 25] The temperature
dependence of the upper critical field present an upward curvature,
provided by electrons at distinctly bands. This can be explained by (i)
significantly different Fermi velocities (V_(F)) at the two bands and
(ii) strong coupling in the small-V_(F) and and sizable coupling between
the small-V_(F) and large-V_(F) bands, where V_(F) is the Fermi
velocity. This upward curvature will increase as the ratio of the Fermi
velocities increases.[26] In contrast, when the strongest coupling is in
the large-V_(F) band the curvature of H_(c2)(T) near T_(c) is
negative.[27, 28] Thus the result presented in Fig. 9 can be interpreted
as the average of the contribution of two coupled superconductors, one
with a small H_(c)(0) and high T_(c) and the other with large H_(c2)(T)
and small T_(c). This scenario would explain the apparent contradiction
between the temperature dependence of H_(c1)(T) and H_(c2)(T) seen in
Figs. 11 and 9, respectively. To really clarify this point measurements
in single crystals are needed. Borrowing this reasoning we speculate
that Zr_(0.96)V_(0.04)B₂ could be a further example of a multiband in
the same MgB₂ prototype structure.

In order to further confirm the bulk superconductivity of
polycrystalline Zr_(0.96)V_(0.04)B₂ sample we measured the zero applied
magnetic field temperature dependence of the specific-heat (C_(P)). An
anomaly (jump) at 8.7 K is clearly observed in the C_(P)/T vs T²
measurement as shown in Fig. 12. This result is totally consistent with
the M vs T and ρ vs T measurements where the same superconducting
critical temperature is seen. The normal state can be fitted to the
expression C_(P) = γ T + βT³ by a least-square analysis, which yields
the value γ = 3.8 (mJ/molK²) and β = 0.034 (mJ/molK⁴). The β value
corresponding to Debye temperature Θ_(D) ∼ 555.6 K, and the electronic
coefficient (γ is the Sommerfeld constant) measures the density of the
states at the Fermi level. The subtraction of the phonon contribution
allows us to isolate the electronic contribution to the specific heat,
which can be plotted as C_(s)/T vs T as shown in the inset of this
figure. These results show that Zr_(0.96)V_(0.04)B₂ is unambiguously a
bulk superconducting material. However, the size of the jump
(ΔC/γ T_(c)) is about 0.42, which is considerably smaller than the weak
coupling BCS prediction (1.43). This value suggests that the
superconductivity in this material could be unconventional in its
origin. In fact, the ln(C_(s)/γ T_(c)) against T_(c)/T displays a strong
divergence from BCS theory already close to T_(c) (see Fig. 13), which
is consistent with the unconventional behavior,[29] as observed in the
jump shown in the inset of the Fig. 12.

The origin of the unconventional behavior observed in H_(c1) and in
specific heat is not obvious but could be related to the multiband
characteristic of this kind of the structure (σ and π bands), which
seems to be typical of the AlB₂ prototype structure.

## IV Conclusions

In this paper we have presented a systematic study of Zr_(1 − x)V_(x)B₂
polycrystalline samples. Our results show

that vanadium is able to induce superconductivity in the
nonsuperconductor material ZrB₂. The excellent agreement of transition
temperature as characterized by the magnetic, resistivity, and
specific-heat data unambiguously indicates that the Zr_(0.96)V_(0.04)B₂
compound exhibits a bulk superconducting transition temperature ∼8.7 K.
Unconventional superconductivity related to multiple bands at the Fermi
surface is suggested as a possibility for our findings.
