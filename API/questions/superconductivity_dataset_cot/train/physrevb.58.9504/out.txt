###### Abstract

Synthesis of CuBa_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4}O_{12-y} (Cu-1234) with Mg doping at the Ca sites, hitherto unexplored, is attempted and reported here. Different samples with 5%, 10%, 20%, and 33% Mg (in nominal stoichiometry) have been prepared in gold capsules under 3.5 GPa pressure and at about 1000 degC temperature using a cubic anvil-type high-pressure machine. The samples were characterized through x-ray diffractometry, resistivity, dc susceptibility, and Hall effect measurements. The samples were then aligned along their c axis under 10 T field at room temperature. Magnetization (both in H\parallel_ab_ and H\parallel_c_) was measured between 120 and 5 K in different field values up to 5 T. The superconducting anisotropy (defined as \xi_{ab}/\xi_{c}\!=\!H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^{*}), estimated in the reversible magnetization regime, comes out to be about 1.4, and is lower than that of the pristine sample. Improvement in the anisotropy factor obtained has been discussed in light of the observed changes in the lattice parameters and the hole concentration, emanating from Mg doping in the Cu-site vacancies in charge reservoir blocks of the 1234 structure.

## I Introduction

The emergence of the Hg-based 136 K high-temperature cuprate superconductor (HTSC) and its T_{c} enhancement of 156 K has sparked off hectic activity in this area. Since then many other systems like TlBaCaCuO, (Cu-Tl)BaCaCuO having a cationic stoichiometry of 1223 and 1234, have been generated [1, 2, 3] to yield a T_{c} of around 120 K. Most notably among them is the n = 4 member of the CuBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{12-y} family. Besides possessing high critical temperature T_{c} , high critical current density J_{c} , and high irreversibility field H_{ir} , this happens to be the only HTSC material without any toxic components like Hg or Tl. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] CuBa_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4}O_{12-y} (Cu-1234) is a high-pressure-high-temperature phase exhibiting superconductivity at 118 K at ambient pressure. Superconducting anisotropy for this compound is also the least among such HTSC families. Such low anisotropy has its root in the crystal structure of this compound itself. Here the superconducting blocks of Ca_{3}Cu_{4}O_{8} are separated by the conducting CuBa_{2}O_{4-y} charge reservoir blocks instead of the nonconducting TlBa_{2}O_{3} blocks in the analogous Tl-1234 superconductor. [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60 Figure 2: (a)–(d) Resistivity behavior with temperature.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c c c c} Sample & T_{c} & a & c & 1/eR_{H} & n_{H} & H_{c_{2}}^{ab}(0) & H_{c_{2}}^{c}(0) & \xi_{ab} & \xi_{c} & \xi_{c} \\  & (K) & (Å) & (Å) & (10^{21}/cm^{3  for powder homogeneity. The precursors were mixed with small amounts of AgO (0.4 mol fraction) as oxidizer and AgCO3 (0.2 mol fraction) for Cu-1234 phase stabilization. The final reaction to realize the 1234 material was carried out at 1000 degC in a gold capsule at 3.5 GPa pressure in a cubic anvil-type high-pressure machine (Riken CAP-07). The sample was subsequently quenched to ambient temperature before the pressure was released.12 It is worth pointing out here that even though a very small amount of AgCO3 has been added to the precursor before the high-pressure treatment, the final 1234 material realized is not devoid of the oxycarbonate content, however small its fraction may be.

Footnote 12: The 1234 material was deposited at 1000 degC in the 1234 material.

Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the samples was carried out using a Rigaku RINT 1000 diffractometer with monochromatized Cu K_{a} radiation. These samples were further characterized for their superconductivity through resistivity (four-probe technique) and dc susceptibility measurements (Quantum Design MPMS SQUID magnetometer). Finely ground powders of these materials were mixed with an epoxy resin (Cemedine EP-007) in a teflon tube and aligned along the c axis in a field of 10 T for 10 h at room temperature using the anisotropic normal-state magnetic susceptibility. The degree of _c_-axis alignment is checked through the intensities of the tetragonal (00/_l_) peaks of the diffractograms. Hall coefficient measurements on the unaligned samples have also been carried out in 2 T field in the temperature range 300-120 K, to check for the possible variation in the hole concentration resulting from Mg doping.

## III Results and Discussion

Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show the XRD patterns of both the as-prepared randomly oriented and _c_-axis aligned samples with different Mg contents. All the characteristic peaks corresponding to an average tetragonal 1234 structure with P4/_mmm_ symmetry could be identified with some unidentified minor impurity peaks. A small peak (marked ) corresponding to MgO was also seen in the highest doped

Figure 4: (a)–(d) Magnetization-temperature behavior for different field values in _H//c_ configuration.

  (33% Mg) sample. While there is not much change in the _a_-axis parameter with increasing Mg content (0.02 A), a noticeable reduction in the c parameter (0.07 A) has been observed till x = 0.10 (10% Mg), beyond which it remains nearly constant. The degree of _c_-axis alignment of the doped samples was checked through the equation P(006) = 1 - \beta, where

\[\beta = (I_{105}/I_{006})^{\text{aligned}}/(I_{105}/I_{006})^{\text{unaligned}}\]

and I105 and I006 are the relative intensities of the (105) and (006) reflections.13 The _c_-axis alignment was seen to be better than 98% in all the Mg-doped samples.

The resistivity-temperature behavior of the various Mg-containing samples is provided in the Figs. 2(a)-2(d). All the samples exhibit good metallicity with resistivity zero temperature around 116 K, closely matching with _T_c(_R_ = 0) = 117.5 K of the undoped Cu-1234 material. The diamagnetic susceptibility measurements with 10 Oe field also corroborate these transition temperatures and are shown in the insets of their respective figures. Phase purity of the materials is also indicated by the well-defined single diamagnetic transition.

The superconducting anisotropy of the cuprate superconductors is seen to be related to the anisotropy in their upper and lower critical fields _H_c2 and _H_c1, coherence length x, and the field penetration depth l. The anisotropy parameter g has been defined as14\gamma = H_{c2}^{ab}H_{c2}^{c} = \xi_{ab}/\xi_{c}. dc magnetization on the _c_-axis aligned samples was measured from 120 to 5 K under several field values ranging from 0.1 to 5 T. Figs. 3(a)-3(d) and Figs. 4(a)-4(d) depict the magnetization data for the _H_//_ab_ and _H_//_c_ configurations, respectively, for the various Mg-doped samples. A linear extrapolation of the magnetization in reversible regime to the normal-state phase line gives the relationship between _T_c and _H_c2. Figures 5(a) and 5(b) give the temperature dependence of H_{c2}^{ab} and H_{c2}^{c} for samples with 5%, 10% Mg (_x_ = 0.05 and 0.10) and for 20%, 33% Mg (_x_ = 0.20 and 0.33) dopings, respectively. The upper critical fields are estimated through an extrapolation to T = 0 using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) relation15H_{c2}(0) = - 0.69(dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}}T_{c}. Table I lists the values of H_{c2}^{ab}(0) and H_{c2}^{c}(0) for the different samples and are compared with those of the pristine sample. The superconducting anisotropy factor g as determined through the ratio of H_{c2}^{ab}(0)/H_{c2}^{c}(0) comes out to be of the order of 1.4, indicating a clear improvement over that of the undoped sample.

Recently, Iyo _et al._10 have reported that the c parameter decreased with increase of the carbon content in the (Cu,C1 - _x_)-1234 from 18.02 A for x = 1 to 17.90 A for the x = 0.5. Akimoto _et al._11 have carried out further investigations on the crystal chemistry of small crystals of the compounds belonging to the Cu,Ba2Ca - 1Cu,O3 and Cu2 - Ba2Ca - 1Cu,O7 families with n = 4,5,6. It was concluded that with increasing x in the carbonless case, the c parameter decreases. And in the Cu-C case, the Cu content x decreases together with decrease in the c parameter. More significantly, the thickness of the charge reservoir block (CRB) decreases with increasing Cu-site occupancy in the carbonless case and with increasing C content in the (Cu-C) case, while the superconducting layer block (SLB) thickness remained unchanged in both the families with n = 4 and the higher homologues of n = 5 and 6. The decrease in the c parameter leading to a shrinkage of the CRB is the general scenario where no substitution in SLB is attempted. The present case of Mg incorporation is seemingly such an extension. The c parameter would be expected to reduce in both situations of Mg occupying defect sites (Cu-site vacancies) in the charge reservoir layer and at the perovskite Ca sites in the superconducting block. Even though Mg substitution at the perovskite Y or Ca sites16,17 has been reported in the case of YBa2Cu3O - s and Bi3Sr3CaCu3O , the observed decrease in the hole density with increase in Mg

Figure 5: (a) Temperature dependence of _H_c2 for 5% and 10% Mg (_x_ = 0.05 and 0.10) doped samples in _H_//_ab_ and _H_//_c_ configurations. (b) Temperature dependence of _H_c2 for 20% and 33% Mg (_x_ = 0.20 and 0.33) doped samples in _H_//_ab_ and _H_//_c_ configurations.

  content in the present case (Fig. 6 and Table 1) is the obvious signature of Mg at the defect sites of CRB and is the most likely situation. The intersuperconducting block coupling, therefore, is expected to be modified favorably as a result of the decrease in the CRB thickness in spite of the fact that such a blocking layer has been rendered less conducting. CRB seemingly resembles the proximity type of a superconductor-normal-metal-superconductor junction (SNS) with the reduction of its size overcompensating the decrease in carrier density. In such a situation, superconducting wave functions of the adjoining SLB would have a better overlap, leading eventually to a less superconducting anisotropy as observed presently.

It is interesting to note from Fig. 6 that the hole concentration in the various Mg-doped samples lies in the limits of that of 0% and 30% carbon content 1234 samples, with the oxygenated 5% Mg sample having a high hole density as that of the 30% carbon case, while 0% carbon, 33% Mg cases correspond to nearly the same lower hole density. Apparently, Mg ions seem to have a stronger affinity to occupy the vacancies in the charge reservoir layer than carbon, at least in the present heat treatment schedule, making the CRB less conducting. The observed increase in the normal-state resistivity (Fig. 2) with increasing dopant content is a clear manifestation of such an effect. The exact mechanism of how the hole density increases with oxygenation (5% Mg), however, is far from clear. It would therefore be worthwhile to determine the hole concentration of the different Mg-doped oxygenated samples and the ensuing effect on the superconducting anisotropy to generate a possible relationship between them.

## IV Conclusions

Samples with 5% to 33% Mg (_x_ = 0.05 to 0.33) at Ca in the nominal composition of CuBa2(Ca1_{1-x}Mgx)3Cu_{0}O12_{2-y} HTSC material have been synthesized in Au capsules by a high-pressure (3.5 GPa)-high-temperature (1000 degC) reaction process using a cubic anvil-type high-pressure machine. Both _a_- and _c_-axis lattice parameters are seen to decrease with Mg incorporation. Hole concentration n_{H} (as determined through Hall measurements) also decreases from 0.5 to 0.34 per CuO2 layer for the highest doped sample. The superconducting anisotropy _x__ab_/_x__c_ of 1.4 as determined by the ratio of upper critical field measurements (through magnetization in _H__H__l_/_ab_ and _H__l_/_c_) in the _c_-axis aligned samples shows an improvement over that (1.6) of the pristine Cu-1234 material and happens to be the least among such families of HTSC's. Such a situation is understood in terms of Mg doping in the charge reservoir blocks (making n_{H} lower and reducing the c parameter). The reduction in the intersuperconducting Ca3Cu4O8 block spacing (shrinkage of the charge reservoir block thickness) perhaps leads to an enhanced superconducting coupling among them, eventually reducing the anisotropy in these materials.
