###### Abstract

We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of the effects of pressure on \(T_{c}\) of the hexagonal layered superconductors _nH_-CaAlSi (_n_ = 1, 5, and 6), where _nH_ denotes the different stacking variants that were recently discovered. Experimentally, the pressure dependence of \(T_{c}\) has been investigated by measuring the magnetic susceptibility of single crystals up to 10 kbars. In contrast to previous results on polycrystalline samples, single crystals with different stacking sequences display different pressure dependences of \(T_{c}\). 1_H_-CaAlSi shows a decrease in \(T_{c}\) with pressure, whereas 5_H_- and 6_H_-CaAlSi exhibit an increase in \(T_{c}\) with pressure. _Ab initio_ calculations for 1_H_-, 5_H_-, and 6_H_-CaAlSi reveal that an ultrasound phonon branch associated with out-of-plane vibrations of the Al-Si layers softens with pressure, leading to a structural instability at high pressures. For 1_H_-CaAlSi, the softening is not sufficient to cause an increase in \(T_{c}\), which is consistent with the present experiments but adverse to previous reports. For 5\(H\) and 6\(H\), the softening provides the mechanism to understand the observed increase in \(T_{c}\) with pressure. Calculations for hypothetical 2\(H\) and 3\(H\) stacking variants reveal qualitative and quantitative differences.

Superconductivity in hexagonal layered compounds has attracted a lot of interest since the discovery of "high-\(T_{c}\)" superconductivity in MgB\({}_{2}\) (Ref. [1]) and other structurally related compounds such as (Ca,Sr)AlSi,\({}^{2}\) CaSi\({}_{2}\),\({}^{3}\) and, very recently, alkaline-earth intercalated graphites.\({}^{4-6}\) In all of these compounds, the light elements are arranged in honeycomb layers that are intercalated by alkaline-earth atoms. Depending on the elements forming the honeycomb layer, the electron and phonon states involved in the superconducting pairing are quite different. In MgB\({}_{2}\), the holes in the \(\sigma\) bands of the \(B\) layer strongly couple to \(B\) bond-stretching phonon modes. In CaSi\({}_{2}\), which can be considered as the "antibonding analog" to MgB\({}_{2}\), the \(\sigma^{*}\) bands are strongly coupled to the bond-stretching phonons of the Si layer. In CaC\({}_{6}\) and CaAlSi, the so-called interlayer bands are filled and experience significant electron-phonon (_e_-ph) interaction to the out-of-plane buckling vibrations of the honeycomb layers.\({}^{7-11}\)

CaAlSi is of particular interest because it exhibits an ultrasoft phonon mode and crystallizes with several stacking variants.\({}^{12,13}\) The interplay of these two ingredients gives rise to intriguing effects on both normal and superconducting properties. The presence of an ultrasoft phonon mode at ~7 meV was initially evidenced by first-principles calculations\({}^{10,11,14-16}\) and recently confirmed by neutron-scattering experiments.\({}^{16}\) The ultrasoft phonon modes are believed to induce a strong _e_-ph coupling and to lead to an enhanced specific heat anomaly at \(T_{c}\) as well as to a _positive_ pressure dependence of \(T_{c}\) in CaAlSi. These effects have not been observed in the isoelectronic and isostructural SrAlSi, which does not display any signature of soft phonon modes.\({}^{17}\)

Recent x-ray diffraction experiments on _nH_-CaAlSi single crystals revealed several stacking variations of two different types of Al-Si layers, denoted as \(A\) and \(B\) in the following (see Fig. 1). The \(A\) and \(B\) layers differ by a 60\({}^{\circ}\) rotation around the \(c\) axis.\({}^{12,13}\) Besides the simple 1\(H\) structure characterized by an \(|A|A|\)... stacking, two more stacking variants were found: 5\(H\) with an \(AABBB\) and 6\(H\) with an \(AABBB\) sequence. Stacking of the \(A\) and \(B\) layers induces an internal stress on the structure, causing a buckling of _boundary layers_, i.e., layers with a different neighboring layer. Subsequent investigations show that the superconducting properties strongly depend on the kind of stacking of \(A\) and \(B\) layers.\({}^{13,18-20}\) However, all _ab initio_ calculations, and analyses of the experimental data based thereon, so far have assumed that the stacking of Al-Si planes along the \(c\) axis is either uniform or completely disordered. To clarify the complex interplay of stacking variants, buckling, soft modes, and

Flat and buckled Al-Si layers are indicated with and without an asterisk, respectively.

 superconductivity, further investigation of the _e_-ph properties of different stacking variants of CaAlSi is highly desirable.

In this paper, we investigate the effects of pressure on the superconducting properties of _nH_-CaAlSi by experiments on single crystals and _ab initio_ calculations of the _e_-ph properties. Previous experiments on polycrystalline samples of CaAlSi and SrAlSi showed that \(T_{c}\) of CaAlSi increases under pressure, while \(T_{c}\) of SrAlSi decreases.17 In an _ab initio_ study, Huang _et al._15 proposed that in 1_H_-CaAlSi, an enhancement of the _e_-ph coupling associated with the ultrasoft phonon modes can overcome the negative contribution of the other phonon branches and lead to an increase in \(T_{c}\) under pressure. Such an ultrasoft phonon mode was not obtained for SrAlSi.

However, recent experimental and theoretical results question these findings. First, until now, the pressure dependence of \(T_{c}\) in polycrystalline samples has been interpreted assuming a 1\(H\) stacking variant. However, here we will demonstrate that the pressure dependence of \(T_{c}\) for 1_H_-CaAlSi single crystals is markedly different from that of polycrystalline samples. Second, in these calculations,15 the soft phonon branch in CaAlSi is unstable in some parts of the Brillouin zone, already at ambient pressure. This instability was not confirmed by recent _ab initio_ calculations and neutron-scattering experiments.11,16 Finally, Huang _et al._ assumed a uniform compressibility, which is very unlikely to occur in layered materials.

The aim of our analysis is twofold: on the one hand, we wish to investigate the interplay between soft modes and superconductivity in 1_H_-CaAlSi based on _ab initio_ calculations and experiments on single crystals. On the other hand, we wish to understand how stacking variants affect the pressure dependence of the superconducting properties of CaAlSi.

Single crystals of CaAlSi were grown by using the floating zone method. Details of the crystal growth and characterization are described elsewhere.13 The superconducting transition temperature (\(T_{c}\)) under pressure was determined by measuring the magnetic susceptibility in a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (Quantum Design). A Cu-Be piston-anvil-type pressure cell was used to apply quasid hydrostatic pressures up to _P_~10 kbars, with silicon oil or Fluorinert as a pressure transmitting medium. To monitor the pressure inside the pressure cell, we performed _in situ_ measurements of the \(T_{c}\) of Sn (purity 99.999%) or Pb (purity 99.9999%).21

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility [_kh_(_T_)] of single crystals of _nH_-CaAlSi under pressures up to ~10 kbars. At ambient pressure, the _T__c_s of 1_H_-, 5_H_-, and 6_H_-CaAlSi are 6.50, 5.95, and 7.89 K, respectively, which are consistent with previous reports.13 The superconducting transitions are relatively sharp for 1_H_- and 6_H_-CaAlSi with a transition width of \(\Delta T_{c}\) ~ 0.1 K at 80% of the diamagnetic shielding, indicating a good sample quality. For 5_H_-CaAlSi, the transition is broader (D_T__c_ ~ 0.4 K) but still sharp enough to follow its pressure dependence. With increasing pressure, the superconducting transition for 1_H_-CaAlSi clearly shifts to lower temperatures without a significant broadening of the transition. In contrast, the \(T_{c}\) in 5_H_- and 6_H_-CaAlSi increases with pressure. For all samples, the _T__c_'s and the shape of the _kh_(_T_) trace, taken after gradually releasing the pressure again, did agree with the data collected with increasing pressure.

Our measurements reveal that the pressure variation of \(T_{c}\) of _nH_-CaAlSi strongly depends on the stacking sequence. For a detailed comparison, \(T_{c}\) was identified as the temperature where the extrapolation of the steepest slope of _kh_(_T_) intersects the normal-state susceptibility extrapolated to lower temperatures. Using different criteria to determine \(T_{c}\), e.g., the midpoint of the transition, changes the absolute value of \(T_{c}\), but does not alter the relative variation of \(T_{c}\). Surprisingly, for 1_H_-CaAlSi, \(T_{c}\) linearly decreases with a rate of D_T__c_/_T__c_ = -0.03 K/kbars, in contrast to a previous report on polycrystalline samples.17 For 5_H_-CaAlSi, the pressure dependence is slightly nonlinear with an initial slope of +0.013 K/kbars, while 6_H_-CaAlSi exhibits a more pronounced nonlinear behavior and saturation at _T__c_~7.95 K already at ~10 kbars.

In order to understand the effects of pressure and stacking variants on the superconducting properties of CaAlSi, we performed _ab initio_ density-functional perturbation theory calculations23-25 of the electronic and vibrational properties of _nH_-CaAlSi as a function of pressure. The computational details are given in Appendix B. Besides the identified 1\(H\), 5\(H\), and 6\(H\) stacking variants, we also considered hypothetical 2_H_- and 3_H_-CaAlSi, characterized by \(\left| \right.AB\left| \right.AB\left| \right.AB\left| \right.\) stackings of the Al-Si planes, respectively.

In the investigated pressure range of up to 100 kbars, we

The extrapolation method to determine \(T_{c}\) is demonstrated with solid lines. Right: Pressure dependence of \(T_{c}\) for (a) 1_H_-, (b) 5_H_-, and (c) 6_H_-CaAlSi single crystals.

  relaxed the internal parameters of all structures at intervals of 20 kbars. The details of the optimization, together with the detailed band structures and phonon dispersion relations, will be published elsewhere. We subsequently fitted the \(E\) vs \(V\) curves to a Birch-Murnaghan equation of state to obtain the equilibrium volume \(V\)0 and the bulk modulus \(B\)0 for each system. All equilibrium volumes and bulk moduli are close to each other (68.6 <= \(V\)0 <= 69.0 A3, 49.6 <= \(B\)0 <= 51.8 GPa). In sign and magnitude, our calculations correctly reproduce the corrugation ("buckling") of the Al-Si planes in the 5\(H\) and 6\(H\) structures. A corrugation is also obtained for 3_H_-CaAlSi. In contrast to previous suggestions,[12] the corrugation in the Al-Si layers of the 5\(H\) and 6\(H\) phases is not reduced by applying pressure. Rather, it remains unchanged for 6\(H\), or becomes even more pronounced for 5_H_-CaAlSi. The compressibility is anisotropic, _k_c/_k__a_ = 3.8, as expected for a layered material. At all pressures, the total energy of 2_H_-CaAlSi and 3_H_-CaAlSi is higher than that of 1_H_-, 5_H_-, and 6_H_-CaAlSi, with the latter being almost degenerate in energy.[26]

By using the relaxed structures, we calculated by linear response the phonon frequencies _o_**q**_,\(v\) and the _e_-ph line-widths, from which we obtained the Eliashberg spectral functions and the total electron-phonon coupling l. In Fig. 3, we display the phonon density of states (phDOS) of _nH_-CaAlSi, calculated at the theoretical equilibrium pressure (_P_ = 0) and at the highest pressure considered (100 kbars). At \(P\) = 0, the 1\(H\), 5\(H\), and 6\(H\) stacking variants all show a peak at ~7 meV, which is associated with the out-of-plane vibrations of the Al-Si planes. Under pressure, roughly one-half of the corresponding phonon states soften and drive the system to a structural instability at \(P\) ~ 80 kbars.[27] The corresponding phonon dispersions are shown in Appendix A. The hypothetical 2_H_-CaAlSi and 3_H_-CaAlSi, on the other hand, do not display the ultrasoft phonon peak at \(P\) = 0, and all phonon modes harden with increasing pressure.

At present, we cannot conclusively explain the different phonon softening behavior of the systems. However, by comparing the (partial) phDOS's, which we obtained for different _nH_ stacking variants with those of previous virtual crystal approximation calculations,[11, 16] we observe that phonon softening mainly involves Al out-of-plane vibrations. Phonon softening appears if a block of three or more like planes are found in the sequence. This probably reflects the tendency of Al to form bonds with other Al atoms in the neighboring layers rather than _sp_2 bonds with Si in the same layer, if the \(c\) lattice constant is small enough.

Our results strongly differ from those of Ref. [15] for 1_H_-CaAlSi. At \(P\) = 0, our phonon frequencies are all real, and even at higher pressures, only a few become imaginary, while in Ref. [15], the whole out-of-plane branch becomes unstable. The most likely reason for this discrepancy is that we optimized the structural parameters, while the previous work assumed an isotropic compressibility. Also, a careful convergence of phonon frequencies with respect to **k** sampling and basis set size is crucial to obtain the correct behavior of the ultrasoft phonon modes.

If the coupling to the electrons is strong enough to overcome the opposing effect of the hardening of the other phonons and of the decrease in the electronic density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level, a soft phonon mode can lead to an increase in _T_c with pressure. In Fig. 4, we show the calculated pressure dependences of the electronic DOS at the Fermi level, _N_(\(E_{F}\)), and of the lowest lying phonon frequency at the \(H\) point (\(o_{H}\)) for 1_H_-, 5_H_-, and 6_H_-CaAlSi. We estimate the pressure evolution of the partial _e_-ph coupling constant associated with the soft phonon mode by using the Hopfield formula: \(\lambda = N(E_{F})I^{2}/o_{H}^{2}\), where \(I\) is the _e_-ph matrix element. By assuming that \(I\) is independent of pressure, we estimate that the partial l increases by ~60% for 1\(H\) and 6\(H\), and by ~50% for 5\(H\). For 2_H_- and 3_H_-CaAlSi (not shown), _N_(\(E_{F}\)) decreases and \(o_{H}\) increases, resulting in a net decrease in l. From this argument, one could expect a very similar (increasing) behavior of _T_c with pressure for \(n\) = 1, 5, and 6. This is, however, not observed experimentally.

Figure 5 shows the evolution of the Eliashberg function \(\alpha^{2}F(\omega)\) of 1_H_-CaAlSi for which we ran a full _e_-ph calculation as a function of pressure. In agreement with previous calculations,[11, 16] at \(P\) = 0 there is a large peak at \(o\) ~7 meV, which is associated with the Al-Si out-of-plane vibrations in the _k_z = \(\pi/c\) plane, implying that the corresponding phonon states have a considerable coupling to electrons. At higher pressures, following the behavior of the phDOS, this peak splits into two peaks, one of them softening,

  the other hardening with increasing pressure. The pressure-induced transfer of the spectral weight from the hard to the soft part of the low-lying peak affects both the total _e_-ph coupling parameter \(\lambda = 2f_{0}^{\infty}\alpha^{2}F(\omega)\omega^{-1}d\omega\) and the logarithmic-averaged phonon frequency \(\langle\omega_{\text{ln}}\rangle\). By using the following Allen-Dynes equation:[30]

\[T_{c} = \frac{\langle\omega_{\text{ln}}\rangle}{1.2}\text{exp}\left[ \frac{- 1.04(1 + \lambda)}{\lambda - (1 + 0.62\lambda)\mu^{\ast}} \right],\]

where \(\mu^{\ast}\) is the Coulomb pseudopotential, fixed to \(\mu^{\ast} = 0.1\) in the following (see Table 1), we obtain a _decrease_ in \(T_{c}\) with pressure for 1_H_-CaAlSi, which is in agreement with our experiments. A slight variation of \(\mu^{\ast}\) does not alter this general behavior.

In stark contrast to the previous report for 1_H_-CaAlSi,[15] the effect of softening of the ultrasoft phonon modes is apparently not sufficient to overcome the opposing contributions from the other phonon branches. For further model calculations, we used a decomposition of \(\alpha^{2}F(\omega)\) of 1_H_-CaAlSi into Gaussians, as shown in Fig. 5. Using this decomposition reveals that the behavior of \(T_{c}\) with pressure follows that of the spectral weight of the ultrasoft phonon mode, which decreases with pressure in 1_H_-CaAlSi. The change of the spectral weight of the ultrasoft phonon mode determines the behavior of \(T_{c}\) under pressure, more importantly than the decrease in its phonon frequency.

For 5_H_- and 6_H_-CaAlSi, due to their very large unit cells (15 and 18 atoms, respectively) and the extreme sensitivity of the results to computational parameters, we did not perform a full _e_-ph calculation. Although there are some subtle differences in the electron and phonon dispersions, the results shown in Figs. 3 and 4 imply that the pressure dependence is qualitatively very close to that of 1_H_-CaAlSi [i.e., the _N_(\(E_{F}\))'s and \(\omega_{H}\) decrease with the same rate and a structural instability happens at elevated pressures]. For this reason, we assume that their \(\alpha^{2}F(\omega)\)'s have very similar characteristics to that of 1_H_-CaAlSi. The different pressure dependence of \(T_{c}\) for 5\(H\) and 6\(H\) therefore has to be attributed to a different (increasing) behavior of the spectral weight for the ultrasoft phonon mode under pressure. This behavior could reflect either small differences in _e_-ph matrix elements due to the buckling of some planes or a different number of phonon modes that soften under pressure.

Another aspect, which we cannot rule out completely, is that in 5_H_- or 6_H_-CaAlSi, multiband effects become relevant. Recently, Lupi _et al.[20]_ reported an anisotropy of the optical response in the superconducting and normal states for a crystal with mixed 5\(H\) and 6\(H\) phases. The superconducting gap, determined by penetration depth measurements, also shows a sizable anisotropy, depending on the stacking sequences.[18] Further studies are needed to clarify this point. In particular, understanding the effect of buckling of the Al-Si layers on the anisotropy of the _e_-ph coupling appears to be the crucial issue.

We would like to emphasize once more that the hypothetical systems 2_H_- and 3_H_-CaAlSi show a completely different behavior. First, they are energetically disfavored with respect to existing stacking variants because of a nonoptimized energy balance between the formation of _AB_ interfaces and buckling. Second, they do not display any soft phonon modes, which only appear if three or more Al atoms are arranged in a sequence along the \(c\) axis.

All phonon modes harden with pressure, leading to an increase in \(\langle\omega_{\text{ln}}\rangle\), a fast decrease in \(\lambda\), and a net decrease in \(T_{c}\) with pressure with a rate of \(dT_{c}/dP\sim-0.05\) K/kbars. For comparison, the results for 2_H_-CaAlSi are also listed in Table 1. Therefore, 2_H_- and 3_H_-CaAlSi do not represent proper models for other stacking variants.

In summary, we demonstrate that for single crystals of _nH_-CaAlSi, the behavior of \(T_{c}\) under pressure crucially depends on the particular stacking sequence and the buckling of the Al-Si layers. \(T_{c}\)_decreases_ for 1\(H\) and _increases_ with pressure in 5_H_- and 6_H_-CaAlSi. Previous experiments on polycrystalline samples gave results that are closer to the behavior of 6_H_-CaAlSi but adverse to the behavior of 1_H_-CaAlSi. One may speculate that the polycrystalline sample consisted mainly of phases with stacking variants other than 1_H_-CaAlSi. Based on our _ab initio_ calculations, we find a gradual softening of an out-of-plane phonon mode under pressure for _nH_-CaAlSi (_n_=1, 5, and 6), which leads to a structural instability at higher pressures. In 1_H_-CaAlSi, the softening is not strong enough to lead to an increase in \(T_{c}\), which is in contrast to previous calculations, while it is

## Appendix A Electron and Phonon dispersions

In this appendix, we briefly describe the main features of the electronic and phononic dispersion relations of 1_H_-, 5_H_-, and 6_H_-CaAlSi. A detailed discussion will be published elsewhere.[31]

Figure 6 shows the electronic structures at ambient pressure, which is in very good agreement with previous results.[11, 29] The essential features are best discussed for 1_H_-CaAlSi. The band structures (and the Fermi surfaces) of 5_H_- and 6_H_-CaAlSi have features very similar to those of 1_H_-CaAlSi. The main difference is that, due to the additional _AB_ interfaces and buckling of Al-Si layers, small gaps appear between the folded-in sheets of the interlayer hole Fermi surface along the \(\Gamma\)-_M_ line.

At the \(\Gamma\) point, the top of the bonding \(\sigma\) bands is situated \(\sim\)2 eV below \(E_{F}\), crossed by the bonding \(\pi\) band. The band at \(\sim\)0.2 eV below \(E_{F}\) has a significant Ca character, and it can be traced back to the interlayer band of graphite. It forms a small electron pocket in the Fermi surface around the \(\Gamma\) point and a larger hole pocket around the \(M\) point. The remaining tubular part of the Fermi surface, shown in Ref. [11], is due to the \(\pi^{*}\) band.

The phonon dispersion relations for the three stacking variants are shown in Fig. 7. In all cases, in-plane modes of the Al-Si layers are found at \(\sim\)50 meV, and mixed Ca-Al-Si modes at \(\sim\)20 meV. An ultrasoft optical mode with \(\omega\sim\)7 meV is found along the _A_-_L_-_H_ line in 1_H_-CaAlSi. In 5_H_- and 6_H_-CaAlSi, due to zone folding, this single mode gives rise to an extremely flat branch along the _L_-_H_-_K_-_M_ face of the Brillouin zone, marked by small arrows in the figure. An inspection of the eigenvector shows that this branch corresponds to an out-of-plane vibration of the Al-Si atoms. At the \(H\) point, this mode is almost purely Al like.

Figure 8 shows how electronic and phononic structures are modified by pressure. For simplicity, we only present results for 1_H_-CaAlSi. 5_H_- and 6_H_-CaAlSi show a very similar behavior. The left panel displays the evolution of the electronic structure with pressure. The electronic dispersion varies smoothly between \(P\) = 0 and \(P\) = 100  kbars, where the most significant difference is the disappearance of the small lenticular portion of the Fermi surface centered at the \(\Gamma\) point around \(P\) = 80  kbars. Since this portion gives a minor contribution to the total DOS, the variation of the DOS with pressure is also rather smooth (see Fig. 4). The shape of the outer part of the Fermi surface is not affected by pressure.

On the other hand, the effect of pressure on the phonon dispersions is dramatic, as demonstrated in the right panel of Fig. 8. Here, we focus on the low-energy part of the spectrum (\(\omega\)\(<\)20 meV), which clearly shows that the optical branch at \(\sim\)7 meV, indicated by small arrows in Fig. 7, considerably softens along the _A_-_L_-_H_ line, until it finally

  becomes unstable. The softening is continuous with pressure, which is in contrast to the results reported in Ref. [15]. Other phonon branches (not shown) harden with pressure. 5_H_- and 6_H_-CaAlSi show a very similar behavior, with the modes marked by arrows softening under pressure and becoming unstable at \(P\) ~ 80  kbars.

## Appendix B Computational details

The electronic, structural, and vibrational properties of all our crystals were calculated in the framework of the density-functional theory and of the density-functional perturbation theory,[23] with Kohn-Sham wave functions expanded on a plane-wave basis that is limited by a 40 Ryd cutoff energy.[24; 25] We used Troullier-Martins[32] norm-conserving pseudopotentials generated by the fhipspp package[33] and consistently employed the generalized gradient approximation Perdew-Burke-Emzerhof functional[34] to approximate the exchange-correlation energy functional. The **k**-space integration (electrons) was approximated with a 12 x 12 x 12 x 12 Monkhorst-Pack grid[35] for the self-consistent cycles, with the more accurate tetrahedron method[36] and a 20 x 20 x 20 mesh for the electronic DOS, and with an 18 x 18 x 18 Monkhorst-Pack grid for the electron-phonon coupling. The smearing parameter[37] was set to 0.03 Ryd, which gave a convergence of the total energies within 0.1 mRyd, and 5 cm-1 for the phonon frequencies.

Dynamical matrices and electron-phonon linewidths \(\gamma_{\mathbf{q},\mathbf{r}}\) were evaluated on regular grids in **q** space (phonons). The phonon dispersions and the phDOS were then obtained by Fourier interpolation of the dynamical matrices, while the Eliashberg spectral functions \(\alpha^{2}F(\omega)\) and the total _e_-ph coupling \(\lambda\)s were calculated by summing over individual linewidths and frequencies.

In the present paper, we devoted special care to the convergence of the _e_-ph coupling functions with pressure, which turned out to critically depend on the **q**-space integration, particularly along the \(c\) direction. For the higher pressures, a 6 x 6 x 12 **q** grid was found necessary to ensure convergence.

These **k** and **q** grids refer to the 1\(H\) case, and have been scaled according to the cell size for all other \(n\). For 5_H_- and 6_H_-CaAlSi, as explained in the text, we did not perform a full electron-phonon coupling calculation, but we calculated the dynamical matrices on a 442 grid in **q** space and obtained the full dispersions by Fourier interpolation.

* (22) In Fig. 2(a), to obtain the theoretical \(T_{c}\), we used the Allen-Dynes formula with \(\mu^{*}\)=0.072 in order to match the experimental \(T_{c}\) at _P_=0. The other parameters are listed in Table I. In Fig. 2(c), the \(T_{c}\) vs \(P\) curve for polycrystalline samples is obtained from the raw susceptibility data of Ref. [17], using the same criteria for determining \(T_{c}\) that we used for single crystals.

* (26) Experimentally realized (_n_ = 1, 5, and 6) stacking variants are those for which the energy cost of creating _AB_ interfaces is  compensated by the energy gain due to the buckling of _boundary layers_.
* [27] Preliminary x-ray diffraction experiments confirm a structural instability for 1_H_-CaAlSi at ~9 GPa [J. S. Kim, X. Wang, K. Syassen, R. K. Kremer, and M. Hanfland (unpublished)].
* [28] For consistency, we used the theoretical lattice constants at all pressures. At _P_=0, the deviation between the theoretical and experimental lattice constants is less than 1%, which has no effect on the calculated phonon frequencies for all systems and on the electronic DOS for 1\(H\) and 6\(H\). For 5\(H\), by using the experimental lattice constant at _P_=0, we obtain a much lower value for _N_(\(E_{F}\))=1.1 st/eV f.u., which is in perfect agreement with other calculations (Ref. [29]), and much closer to that of 1\(H\) and 6\(H\).
