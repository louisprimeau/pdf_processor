###### Abstract

Using a cryogenic diamond anvil cell the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} of Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_xCu2O7 for x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.35 has been measured resistively up to ~20 GPa. In high-_T__c_ superconductors there are two contributions to the pressure dependence of T_{c} : one related to pressure-induced charge transfer and one due to intrinsic effects. In the present experiment these contributions could be separated using a simple phenomenological model which incorporates the effect of changes in both the yttrium content x and the applied pressure p on T_{c} . In this system it is found that there hardly is any charge transfer by pressure so that the intrinsic pressure effect is the main contribution to _T__c_/_d_p_. The maximum T_{c} which can be reached in this system is 112 K. [S0163-1829(97)07517-6]

## I Introduction

Since the discovery of superconductivity in the Tl-Sr-Ca-Cu-O system[1, 2] it has taken some effort to improve the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}. The parent compound TlSr2CaCu2O7 (Tl-1212 phase) is a metal, showing no signs of superconductivity at all down to liquid helium temperatures. At room temperature (300 K) TlSr2CaCu2O7 has a resistivity of 7.2 m\Omega cm which gradually decreases as temperature is lowered. Extrapolation of the resistivity curve to 0 K gives a residual resistance of 2.8 m\Omega cm. Moreover, the nominal copper valency in this compound is + 2.5. All of this indicates an excess of holes on the CuO2 layers giving rise to a so-called overdoped state. The number of holes on these layers can effectively be reduced by either substituting Pb4+ for Tl3+ or Y3+ for Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 1, the structure of the resulting compound ideally is built up of alternating CuO2 layers and (Tl,Pb)-O layers. The CuO2 layers are essential for superconductivity to occur in these materials and are doped by the (Tl,Pb)-O layers which behave as charge reservoir as suggested by Hybertsen and Mattheiss[3] on the basis of band structure calculations. By now it seems well established that the superconducting and normal state properties of these and other related ceramic compounds depend strongly on the charge carrier density n_{h} of the CuO2 layers. [4, 5] The charge carrier density is defined as the number of holes per CuO2 layer and copper atom.

A systematic investigation of Tl1-_y_Pb0.5Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_xCu2O7 was carried out by Liu _et al.[6, 7]_ By optimizing the oxygen content for a number of compounds with different y and x, they were able to establish that at ambient pressure the highest T_{c} of ~110 K is found for y = 0.5 and x = 0.2. Since many related compounds show an increase of T_{c} with pressure [8, 9, 10, 11] it is tempting to also try to further increase the T_{c} of this system by applying pressure. Since the hole concentration is influenced both by the lead content y and the yttrium content x, one of the two may be kept fixed and for the present study Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_xCu2O7 was chosen.

This system with the Tl-1212 structure exhibits superconductivity over the entire range 0.0<=_x_ < 0.6. For x = 0.0, T_{c} has a value of 78 K. With increasing yttrium content x, T_{c} increases to a maximum value of 108 K at x = 0.2, and then decreases to 44 K at x = 0.5. For x >= 0.6, the system becomes semiconducting.

Apart from searching for the highest T_{c} , studying this

 system may give important information on the pressure dependence of high-_T__c_ superconductors. As is well known,12-19the application of pressure not only changes the hole concentration on the CuO2 layers, but also changes their maximum _T__c_max as a function of hole concentration. By studying the pressure dependence of samples with different hole concentrations (i.e., different yttrium content _x_) these two effects can be discerned experimentally. This was done previously at _ambient pressure_ by, for instance, Neumeier and Zimmermann14 and by Garcia-Munoz _et al._19

In this paper, the pressure dependence of T_{c} of various Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_Cu2O7 samples is studied up to ~20 GPa. In Sec. II a phenomenological model is presented, which describes T_{c}(_x_,_p_) in a single simple formula. After a description of the sample preparation and the experimental details in Secs. III and IV, it will be shown in Sec. V that the experimentally observed behavior of T_{c} with pressure for the different samples can be used together with the model of Sec. II to find both the intrinsic pressure dependence of T_{c} and the amount of pressure-induced charge transfer.

## II Phenomenological Model

It is generally accepted that the superconducting critical temperature T_{c} in high-_T__c_ superconductors varies approximately as an inverted parabola with the hole concentration n_{h}.20-23 Below a certain minimum hole concentration the compounds are not superconducting and in this region they show nonmetallic behavior. As the hole concentration on the CuO2 layers is increased, T_{c} increases reaching a maximum value _T__c_max at an optimal hole concentration _n__h_max. For still higher values of the hole concentration, T_{c} starts to decrease and eventually goes to zero. In this region the compounds behave as normal metals. In most high-_T__c_ cuprates it appears that optimal doping occurs at22,23n_{h} = 0.16. Compounds with a lower hole concentration are said to be _underdoped_ while compounds with a higher hole concentration are said to be _overdoped_. This behavior can be expressed24-26 by the following simple equation:

\[T_{c}(n_{h}) = T_{c}{\max}[ 1 - \beta(n_{h} - n_{h}{\max})^{2}\rbrack.\]

Considerable effort has been devoted in recent years to elucidate the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature of high-_T__c_ superconductors. High-pressure experiments on these compounds are done in the hope that they provide some answers as to why superconductivity occurs at such high temperatures. They may also provide important clues in order to synthesize other superconducting compounds with even higher _T__c_'s at _ambient pressure_.27 The important information on the mechanism of superconductivity is contained in the pressure dependence of _T__c_max [see Eq. (1)]. Unfortunately, due to the strong pressure dependence of n_{h}, the pressure dependence of _T__c_max is generally very difficult to find. As will be shown below, the present study of a series of compounds with, at ambient pressure, different values of n_{h}, allows one to derive _T__c_max(_p_). This is possible even if the pressure dependence of b and _n__h_max is taken into account.

The pressure dependence of n_{h} is due to charge transfer from the (Tl,Pb)-O layers in Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_Cu2O7 to the CuO2 layers as a result of the contraction of the Cu-(apical) O bondlength28 which favors removal of antibonding electrons. Thus, pressure raises the hole concentration on the CuO2 layers which explains the similarity between pressure and doping experiments. The following relation, therefore, is able to describe the T_{c} vs p behavior observed in many high-_T__c_ compounds5,8,9

\[T_{c}(p) = T_{c}{\max}[ 1 - \alpha(p - p_{\max})^{2}\rbrack.\]

In Sec. V it will be shown that even in Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_Cu2O7, where there is hardly any charge transfer by pressure, the experimental data can be reasonably described by this parabola.

## III Sample Preparation and Characterization

Samples with nominal composition Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_Cu2O7 (0 <= x <= 1) were prepared by a solid state reaction as described in detail by Liu _et al_.6,7 and Liang _et al_.29 High purity CaCO3, Y2O3, SrCO3, and CuO powders from Aldrich Chemical Co. are thoroughly mixed in the appropriate stoichiometric amounts using a mortar and a pestle and subsequently calcined at 970 degC for 12 h in air to form a precursor. This precursor is then mixed with Tl2O3 and PbO, ground, and finally pressed into a pellet (10 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness) under a pressure of 0.2 GPa. In order to prevent loss of thallium and lead during sintering in a furnace at 950 degC for 3 h in flowing oxygen, the pellets are wrapped in gold foil. After sintering, the furnace is cooled down to room temperature at a rate of 5 degC/min. As determined by powder x-ray diffraction measurements30 all the members of the solid solution Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_Cu2O7 (0 <= x <= 1) have the layered structure of TlBa2CaCu2O7 (Tl-1212) belonging to the tetragonal P4\backslash_mmm_ space group (see Fig. 1). More importantly, these measurements confirmed that the sintered samples are homogeneous both in structure and composition.7

By now it has been established that substitution of Pb in the Tl sites,31-33 or Y in the Ca sites,34,35 not only stabilizes the crystal structure of the phase responsible for high temperature superconductivity but in addition also increases the volume fraction of superconducting material in the Tl-1212 phase. As mentioned in the Introduction and as previously proposed,6 substitution of Y3+ for Ca2+ in the system Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_Cu2O7 effectively reduces the hole concentration on the CuO2 layers. Several experimental findings seem to corroborate this. With increasing concentration of Y3+ in the Ca2+ sites, the following effects have been observed:6,7 (1) an increase in the a lattice parameter as determined from Rietveld refinement of neutron powder diffraction data, which generally is attributed to a decrease in the average copper oxidation state, leading to longer Cu-O distances within the CuO2 layers, (2) an increase in the room temperature resistivity, (3) a decrease in the effective number of holes determined from Hall coefficient measurements, and (4) an increase in the absolute value of the thermoelectric power. Contrary to the increase in the a lattice parameter, the c lattice parameter decreases. This is probably due to the fact that in an eightfold coordination the radius of the Y3+ ion (1.019 A) is slightly smaller than that of the Ca2+ ion (1.12 A).36  Several Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca0.3Y0.2Cu2O7 samples were subjected to annealing treatments7 which included slow cooling to 350 degC in oxygen and annealing at 500 degC and 600 degC in 2, 0.2, 0.009, and 0.0 % of oxygen in nitrogen at 1 bar. Following each of these annealings no significant shift in the diamagnetic onset temperature of 108 K was observed. Liu _et al._7 hence conclude that this compound with the highest T_{c} is very stable and does not exhibit any deviation of the oxygen stoichiometry. In all compositions the oxygen stoichiometry determined from neutron diffraction experiments was found to be very close to 7 and independent of the yttrium content x. As at ambient pressure, the sample with nominal composition x\!=\!0.4 showed a higher T_{c} value (extrapolated from the T_{c} vs p curve) compared to the one reported by Liu _et al._7 it is not inconceivable that the small piece used in the high-pressure experiment had a slightly lower yttrium content with as result a higher hole concentration and hence a higher T_{c} value. Using T_{c} as a calibration, x should have a value of \sim0.35 (see Ref. [7]) instead of 0.4. Throughout the rest of this paper this value will be used in the calculations and the sample is consequently labeled x\!=\!0.35.

## IV Experimental details

Pressure is generated and applied to the samples using a cryogenic diamond anvil cell37 (DAC). Its principle of operation is described in detail by Scholtz _et al._37 and by Tristan Jover _et al._10.38 The applied pressure is determined _in situ_, close to the superconducting transition of the samples, with the ruby fluorescence method. After correction for the temperature-induced shift of the ruby R_{1} fluorescence line,39 the calibration of Mao _et al._40 is used. All experiments are made with the same pressure cell. The pressure is always changed at \sim\!185 K and the data points are taken with increasing pressure only.

The temperature of the sample is measured using a standard platinum resistor placed in a copper block in which one of the diamonds is mounted. Since at low temperatures diamond has an even higher thermal conductivity than copper, there is good thermal contact between sample and thermometer. To check for possible thermal gradients in the body of the high-pressure cell, two other platinum resistors are mounted approximately 1 cm above and below the diamond anvils. The temperature difference is found to be 0.6 K. Interpolated linearly, this corresponds to a temperature difference across the sample of 3 mK.

The superconducting transition temperature T_{c} of the sample is determined resistively using the standard four-probe technique. The electrical leads are placed on top of one of the diamonds. These leads consist of flattened gold wires with a diameter of 25 \mum which are pressed onto the sample for electrical contact. The four-point resistance R(T) of the sample as a function of temperature is then measured with a Keithley 2001 multimeter using a current of 1 mA.

## V Experimental results and discussion

In Fig. 2 the T_{c} values at ambient pressure (extrapolated values from the T_{c} vs p curves) of the investigated samples are plotted as a function of the yttrium content x. While the x\!=\!0.0 and x\!=\!0.1 samples are overdoped, the x\!=\!0.35 sample is clearly underdoped. The x\!=\!0.2 sample is only slightly overdoped.

The T_{c} vs x behavior reflects the parabolic dependence of T_{c} vs n_{h} as described by Eq. (1), since the chemical doping x leads to a change in doping n_{h}; in fact n_{h}\!\propto\!-\,x. Therefore the quadratic function T_{c}(x)\!=\!a_{0}\!+\!a_{1}\!\times\!a_{2}\,x^{2} was used to fit the experimental data in Fig. 2 (solid line). With T_{c} in units of K, the fitting parameters are a_{0}\!=\!77.9, a_{1}\!=\!266.7, and a_{2}\!=\!-\,639.3. From this fit the optimum value of x at ambient pressure is found to be x_{\rm max}\!=\!0.21 with T_{\rm cmax}\!=\!105.7 K, i.e., slightly lower than the maximum value reported previously.6,7

Figure 3 shows typical superconducting transitions for the x\!=\!0.2 sample at two different pressures. The resistance curves are normalized with respect to their values measured at 80 K. As indicated on the 2.5 GPa curve in Fig. 3, the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} is defined as the intersection of the tangent through the inflection point of the resistive transition with a straight line fit of the normal state just above the transition. A clear shift of T_{c} towards higher values is observed in going from 2.5 GPa to 10.8 GPa.

Above T_{c} the resistance increases with decreasing temperature. This is attributed to the presence of intergrain boundaries in these samples, which have a measured density of the order of 55-65 % of the theoretical density, and hence is not related to superconductivity at all. From scanning electron microscopy the grain sizes are found to be approximately 1 \mum for all the compositions investigated in this

  work. This background fortunately has only a very limited effect upon the determination of T_{c}.

The T_{c} values obtained for all four samples are plotted as a function of pressure in Fig. 4. A parabolic pressure dependence of T_{c} is found for all samples except for the one with x\!=\!0.0. This sample shows an approximate linear T_{c} vs p dependence. For the nearly optimal doped sample (x\!=\!0.2) T_{c} reaches a maximum value of 112 K at \sim\!8 GPa. A further increase in pressure only leads to a decrease in T_{c} . A similar behavior is also seen in the x\!=\!0.1 and x\!=\!0.35 samples.

In agreement with Eq. (2), the quadratic function

\[T_{c}(p)\!=\!b_{0}\!+\!b_{1}p+b_{2}p^{2}\] (3)

was used to fit the experimental data for each compound with different yttrium content x in Fig. 4 where T_{c} is expressed in K and p in GPa. The fit parameters b_{i} are given in Table 1, the corresponding curves are the solid lines shown in Fig. 4. These fits will now be used to construct a single function T_{c}(x,p) which describes all the data of Fig. 4. As a first step parabolas such as the one shown in Fig. 2, which holds for ambient pressure, are constructed at various pressures; i.e., the relation

\[T_{c}(x)\!=\!a_{0}\!+\!a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}\] (4)

is constructed for p\!=\!0.2, ...,20 GPa. Since in general the increment in pressure in the experiment is not constant, at each given pressure for all four x values the corresponding T_{c} values are obtained by the interpolation of Eq. (3) of which the appropriate coefficients are given in Table 1.

As a result the fit parameters a_{i} are obtained at all pressure values considered. To obtain a single function T_{c}(x,p), a smooth function can be fitted to the parameters T_{\rm{cmax}}, \beta^{\rm{n}}, and x_{\rm{max}} as a function of pressure after rewriting Eq. (4) as follows:

\[T_{c}(x,p) = \!\left(\!a_{0}\!-\!\frac{a_{1}^{2}}{4\,a_{2}}\!\right)\!\left[1 \!-\!\left(\frac{-a_{2}}{a_{0}\!-\!(a_{1}^{2}\!/\!4a_{2})}\!\right)\!\left(x \!+\!\frac{a_{1}}{2\,a_{2}}\!\right)^{2}\right]\] (5) \[= T_{\rm{cmax}}(p)\{1\!-\!\beta^{\rm  while the sharp dropoff at the upper right corner in Fig. 6 is reduced: the position of the 75 K isotherm as shown would then represent a 90 K isotherm.

Now Fig. 5 will be discussed in more detail. The pressure dependence of T_{c\max}, which represents the intrinsic pressure dependence of T_{c}, shows a maximum around 8 GPa, consistent with Fig. 4. In general, a maximum for T_{c\max} as a function of pressure would be expected: due to the stronger coupling between CuO_{2} layers T_{c} increases until the layers are too close and deformation or other detrimental effects take over. The parameter \beta^{*} defines the width of the parabola shown in Fig. 2, and corresponding ones at higher pressures. The increase of \beta^{*} with pressure implies a slight narrowing of the parabola, which means that T_{c} is more sensitively dependent upon doping, but also that the compound is superconducting in a narrower range of doping. In principle the parameter x_{\max} contains two contributions due to (i) the effect of doping by Y^{\,3+}, Pb^{\,4+} and oxygen deficiency and (ii) the fact that the ambient pressure maximum of T_{c} vs n_{h} is not at n_{h} = 0 but at n_{h} = n_{h\max} \approx 0.16. Incidentally, as explained above there is practically no oxygen deficiency in these compounds and doping due to it can be ignored. The pressure dependence of x_{\max} also contains these two contributions: the pressure-induced shift in n_{h\max} and in doping by Y^{\,3+} and Pb^{\,4+}. Regrettably these two contributions cannot be separated in the present experiment.

It is of course interesting to try and relate x to n_{h} ; first the zero-pressure case is considered. As the high-T_{c} superconductors are usually considered to be _ionic_,[4] charges can be assigned to each of the constituent cations (metal ions) and anions (oxygen ions) which are represented as point charges. Assigning the nominal vacancies to the _ionic_ constituents of Tl_{0.5}Pb_{0.5}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Y_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7}, i.e., Tl^{\,3+}, Pb^{\,4+}, Sr^{\,2+}, Ca^{\,2+}, Y^{\,3+}, Cu^{\,2+}, and O^{\,2-}, the number of holes per CuO_{2} layer per copper atom would be given by

\[n_{h} = 0.25 - \frac{x}{2}.\]

The validity of this relation can be easily checked. The parabola given by Eq. (1) yields precisely T_{c} = 0 for n_{h} = n_{h\max} \pm\sqrt{1/\beta}. The width of the parabola at its base is thus given by \Delta n_{h} = 2 \sqrt{1/\beta}; it is well known [20] that \Delta n_{h} \approx 0.22. Using the fit to the experimental data in Fig. 2 it is found that \Delta x = 0.8, where \Delta x is defined analogously to \Delta n_{h}. As a first approximation n_{h} = const+ (\Delta n_{h}/\Delta x)x or after substituting the values for \Delta n_{h} and \Delta x given above:

\[n_{h} = \mathrm{const} - \frac{x}{3.6}.\]

Comparing this relation to Eq. (6), it becomes clear that the CuO_{2} layers in this particular system benefit only from about half of the chemical doping. Possibly some charge is trapped elsewhere, or not all Y^{\,3+} replaces Ca^{\,2+}.

Now the magnitude of \partial n_{h}/\partial p close to zero pressure is discussed. If the initial slope \partial x_{\max}/\partial p is entirely attributed to a change in the hole concentration n_{h} (to obtain an upper bound) then it is found that \partial n_{h}/\partial p \approx 3.9 \times10^{\,-\,4} GPa^{\,-\,1}, close to the value of 5\times10^{\,-\,4} GPa^{\,-\,1} found [42, 43, 44, 45, 46] for CaLaBaCuO_{7}. Both CaLaBaCu_{3}O_{7} and

Figure 6: Contour plot of T_{c}(x,p). The maximum T_{c} which can be reached in this particular system is 112 K. This value can be reached only under pressure and at optimal yttrium content (x = 0.21).

  {\rm Tl}_{0.5}{\rm Pb}_{0.5}{\rm Sr}_{2}{\rm Ca}_{1-x}{\rm Y}_{x}{\rm Cu}_{2}{\rm O}_{7} have a special crystal structure. In CaLaBaCu_{3}O_{7} the doping of the CuO_{2} layers is provided by the CuO chains, which are very short due to the formation of very small crystallites which make CaLaBaCu_{3}O_{7} macroscopically tetragonal.[42] Gupta and Gupta[47] have calculated that this severely hinders the transfer of charge and hence \delta n_{h}/\partial p is expected to have a small value. In {\rm Tl}_{0.5}{\rm Pb}_{0.5}{\rm Sr}_{2}{\rm Ca}_{1-x}{\rm Y}_{x}{\rm Cu}_{2}{ \rm O}_{7} the doping is provided by the (Tl,Pb)-O layers, which are also known to be of irregular nature. Due to this, charge transfer from the (Tl,Pb)-O layers to the CuO_{2} layers is frustrated. Hence it is considered likely that in {\rm Tl}_{0.5}{\rm Pb}_{0.5}{\rm Sr}_{2}{\rm Ca}_{1-x}{\rm Y}_{x}{\rm Cu}_{2}{ \rm O}_{7} pressure-induced doping of the CuO_{2} layers is very small, although it cannot be ruled out that the change in doping from the (Tl,Pb)-O layers and the pressure-induced shift in n_{h\max} accidentally cancel. A small value for \delta n_{h}/\partial p implies that pressure-induced charge transfer would have a small effect on T_{c} . Hence the extrinsic value of \delta T_{c}/\partial p is small in this particular system.

###### Abstract

Using a cryogenic diamond anvil cell the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} of Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_xCu2O7 for x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.35 has been measured resistively up to ~20 GPa. In high-_T__c_ superconductors there are two contributions to the pressure dependence of T_{c} : one related to pressure-induced charge transfer and one due to intrinsic effects. In the present experiment these contributions could be separated using a simple phenomenological model which incorporates the effect of changes in both the yttrium content x and the applied pressure p on T_{c} . In this system it is found that there hardly is any charge transfer by pressure so that the intrinsic pressure effect is the main contribution to _T__c_/_d_p_. The maximum T_{c} which can be reached in this system is 112 K. [S0163-1829(97)07517-6]

## I Introduction

Since the discovery of superconductivity in the Tl-Sr-Ca-Cu-O system[1, 2] it has taken some effort to improve the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}. The parent compound TlSr2CaCu2O7 (Tl-1212 phase) is a metal, showing no signs of superconductivity at all down to liquid helium temperatures. At room temperature (300 K) TlSr2CaCu2O7 has a resistivity of 7.2 m\Omega cm which gradually decreases as temperature is lowered. Extrapolation of the resistivity curve to 0 K gives a residual resistance of 2.8 m\Omega cm. Moreover, the nominal copper valency in this compound is + 2.5. All of this indicates an excess of holes on the CuO2 layers giving rise to a so-called overdoped state. The number of holes on these layers can effectively be reduced by either substituting Pb4+ for Tl3+ or Y3+ for Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 1, the structure of the resulting compound ideally is built up of alternating CuO2 layers and (Tl,Pb)-O layers. The CuO2 layers are essential for superconductivity to occur in these materials and are doped by the (Tl,Pb)-O layers which behave as charge reservoir as suggested by Hybertsen and Mattheiss[3] on the basis of band structure calculations. By now it seems well established that the superconducting and normal state properties of these and other related ceramic compounds depend strongly on the charge carrier density n_{h} of the CuO2 layers. [4, 5] The charge carrier density is defined as the number of holes per CuO2 layer and copper atom.

A systematic investigation of Tl1-_y_Pb0.5Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_xCu2O7 was carried out by Liu _et al.[6, 7]_ By optimizing the oxygen content for a number of compounds with different y and x, they were able to establish that at ambient pressure the highest T_{c} of ~110 K is found for y = 0.5 and x = 0.2. Since many related compounds show an increase of T_{c} with pressure [8, 9, 10, 11] it is tempting to also try to further increase the T_{c} of this system by applying pressure. Since the hole concentration is influenced both by the lead content y and the yttrium content x, one of the two may be kept fixed and for the present study Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_xCu2O7 was chosen.

This system with the Tl-1212 structure exhibits superconductivity over the entire range 0.0<=_x_ < 0.6. For x = 0.0, T_{c} has a value of 78 K. With increasing yttrium content x, T_{c} increases to a maximum value of 108 K at x = 0.2, and then decreases to 44 K at x = 0.5. For x >= 0.6, the system becomes semiconducting.

Apart from searching for the highest T_{c} , studying this

 system may give important information on the pressure dependence of high-_T__c_ superconductors. As is well known,12-19the application of pressure not only changes the hole concentration on the CuO2 layers, but also changes their maximum _T__c_max as a function of hole concentration. By studying the pressure dependence of samples with different hole concentrations (i.e., different yttrium content _x_) these two effects can be discerned experimentally. This was done previously at _ambient pressure_ by, for instance, Neumeier and Zimmermann14 and by Garcia-Munoz _et al._19

In this paper, the pressure dependence of T_{c} of various Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_Cu2O7 samples is studied up to ~20 GPa. In Sec. II a phenomenological model is presented, which describes T_{c}(_x_,_p_) in a single simple formula. After a description of the sample preparation and the experimental details in Secs. III and IV, it will be shown in Sec. V that the experimentally observed behavior of T_{c} with pressure for the different samples can be used together with the model of Sec. II to find both the intrinsic pressure dependence of T_{c} and the amount of pressure-induced charge transfer.

## II Phenomenological Model

It is generally accepted that the superconducting critical temperature T_{c} in high-_T__c_ superconductors varies approximately as an inverted parabola with the hole concentration n_{h}.20-23 Below a certain minimum hole concentration the compounds are not superconducting and in this region they show nonmetallic behavior. As the hole concentration on the CuO2 layers is increased, T_{c} increases reaching a maximum value _T__c_max at an optimal hole concentration _n__h_max. For still higher values of the hole concentration, T_{c} starts to decrease and eventually goes to zero. In this region the compounds behave as normal metals. In most high-_T__c_ cuprates it appears that optimal doping occurs at22,23n_{h} = 0.16. Compounds with a lower hole concentration are said to be _underdoped_ while compounds with a higher hole concentration are said to be _overdoped_. This behavior can be expressed24-26 by the following simple equation:

\[T_{c}(n_{h}) = T_{c}{\max}[ 1 - \beta(n_{h} - n_{h}{\max})^{2}\rbrack.\]

Considerable effort has been devoted in recent years to elucidate the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature of high-_T__c_ superconductors. High-pressure experiments on these compounds are done in the hope that they provide some answers as to why superconductivity occurs at such high temperatures. They may also provide important clues in order to synthesize other superconducting compounds with even higher _T__c_'s at _ambient pressure_.27 The important information on the mechanism of superconductivity is contained in the pressure dependence of _T__c_max [see Eq. (1)]. Unfortunately, due to the strong pressure dependence of n_{h}, the pressure dependence of _T__c_max is generally very difficult to find. As will be shown below, the present study of a series of compounds with, at ambient pressure, different values of n_{h}, allows one to derive _T__c_max(_p_). This is possible even if the pressure dependence of b and _n__h_max is taken into account.

The pressure dependence of n_{h} is due to charge transfer from the (Tl,Pb)-O layers in Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_Cu2O7 to the CuO2 layers as a result of the contraction of the Cu-(apical) O bondlength28 which favors removal of antibonding electrons. Thus, pressure raises the hole concentration on the CuO2 layers which explains the similarity between pressure and doping experiments. The following relation, therefore, is able to describe the T_{c} vs p behavior observed in many high-_T__c_ compounds5,8,9

\[T_{c}(p) = T_{c}{\max}[ 1 - \alpha(p - p_{\max})^{2}\rbrack.\]

In Sec. V it will be shown that even in Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_Cu2O7, where there is hardly any charge transfer by pressure, the experimental data can be reasonably described by this parabola.

## III Sample Preparation and Characterization

Samples with nominal composition Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_Cu2O7 (0 <= x <= 1) were prepared by a solid state reaction as described in detail by Liu _et al_.6,7 and Liang _et al_.29 High purity CaCO3, Y2O3, SrCO3, and CuO powders from Aldrich Chemical Co. are thoroughly mixed in the appropriate stoichiometric amounts using a mortar and a pestle and subsequently calcined at 970 degC for 12 h in air to form a precursor. This precursor is then mixed with Tl2O3 and PbO, ground, and finally pressed into a pellet (10 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness) under a pressure of 0.2 GPa. In order to prevent loss of thallium and lead during sintering in a furnace at 950 degC for 3 h in flowing oxygen, the pellets are wrapped in gold foil. After sintering, the furnace is cooled down to room temperature at a rate of 5 degC/min. As determined by powder x-ray diffraction measurements30 all the members of the solid solution Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_Cu2O7 (0 <= x <= 1) have the layered structure of TlBa2CaCu2O7 (Tl-1212) belonging to the tetragonal P4\backslash_mmm_ space group (see Fig. 1). More importantly, these measurements confirmed that the sintered samples are homogeneous both in structure and composition.7

By now it has been established that substitution of Pb in the Tl sites,31-33 or Y in the Ca sites,34,35 not only stabilizes the crystal structure of the phase responsible for high temperature superconductivity but in addition also increases the volume fraction of superconducting material in the Tl-1212 phase. As mentioned in the Introduction and as previously proposed,6 substitution of Y3+ for Ca2+ in the system Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_Cu2O7 effectively reduces the hole concentration on the CuO2 layers. Several experimental findings seem to corroborate this. With increasing concentration of Y3+ in the Ca2+ sites, the following effects have been observed:6,7 (1) an increase in the a lattice parameter as determined from Rietveld refinement of neutron powder diffraction data, which generally is attributed to a decrease in the average copper oxidation state, leading to longer Cu-O distances within the CuO2 layers, (2) an increase in the room temperature resistivity, (3) a decrease in the effective number of holes determined from Hall coefficient measurements, and (4) an increase in the absolute value of the thermoelectric power. Contrary to the increase in the a lattice parameter, the c lattice parameter decreases. This is probably due to the fact that in an eightfold coordination the radius of the Y3+ ion (1.019 A) is slightly smaller than that of the Ca2+ ion (1.12 A).36  Several Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca0.3Y0.2Cu2O7 samples were subjected to annealing treatments7 which included slow cooling to 350 degC in oxygen and annealing at 500 degC and 600 degC in 2, 0.2, 0.009, and 0.0 % of oxygen in nitrogen at 1 bar. Following each of these annealings no significant shift in the diamagnetic onset temperature of 108 K was observed. Liu _et al._7 hence conclude that this compound with the highest T_{c} is very stable and does not exhibit any deviation of the oxygen stoichiometry. In all compositions the oxygen stoichiometry determined from neutron diffraction experiments was found to be very close to 7 and independent of the yttrium content x. As at ambient pressure, the sample with nominal composition x\!=\!0.4 showed a higher T_{c} value (extrapolated from the T_{c} vs p curve) compared to the one reported by Liu _et al._7 it is not inconceivable that the small piece used in the high-pressure experiment had a slightly lower yttrium content with as result a higher hole concentration and hence a higher T_{c} value. Using T_{c} as a calibration, x should have a value of \sim0.35 (see Ref. [7]) instead of 0.4. Throughout the rest of this paper this value will be used in the calculations and the sample is consequently labeled x\!=\!0.35.

## IV Experimental details

Pressure is generated and applied to the samples using a cryogenic diamond anvil cell37 (DAC). Its principle of operation is described in detail by Scholtz _et al._37 and by Tristan Jover _et al._10.38 The applied pressure is determined _in situ_, close to the superconducting transition of the samples, with the ruby fluorescence method. After correction for the temperature-induced shift of the ruby R_{1} fluorescence line,39 the calibration of Mao _et al._40 is used. All experiments are made with the same pressure cell. The pressure is always changed at \sim\!185 K and the data points are taken with increasing pressure only.

The temperature of the sample is measured using a standard platinum resistor placed in a copper block in which one of the diamonds is mounted. Since at low temperatures diamond has an even higher thermal conductivity than copper, there is good thermal contact between sample and thermometer. To check for possible thermal gradients in the body of the high-pressure cell, two other platinum resistors are mounted approximately 1 cm above and below the diamond anvils. The temperature difference is found to be 0.6 K. Interpolated linearly, this corresponds to a temperature difference across the sample of 3 mK.

The superconducting transition temperature T_{c} of the sample is determined resistively using the standard four-probe technique. The electrical leads are placed on top of one of the diamonds. These leads consist of flattened gold wires with a diameter of 25 \mum which are pressed onto the sample for electrical contact. The four-point resistance R(T) of the sample as a function of temperature is then measured with a Keithley 2001 multimeter using a current of 1 mA.

## V Experimental results and discussion

In Fig. 2 the T_{c} values at ambient pressure (extrapolated values from the T_{c} vs p curves) of the investigated samples are plotted as a function of the yttrium content x. While the x\!=\!0.0 and x\!=\!0.1 samples are overdoped, the x\!=\!0.35 sample is clearly underdoped. The x\!=\!0.2 sample is only slightly overdoped.

The T_{c} vs x behavior reflects the parabolic dependence of T_{c} vs n_{h} as described by Eq. (1), since the chemical doping x leads to a change in doping n_{h}; in fact n_{h}\!\propto\!-\,x. Therefore the quadratic function T_{c}(x)\!=\!a_{0}\!+\!a_{1}\!\times\!a_{2}\,x^{2} was used to fit the experimental data in Fig. 2 (solid line). With T_{c} in units of K, the fitting parameters are a_{0}\!=\!77.9, a_{1}\!=\!266.7, and a_{2}\!=\!-\,639.3. From this fit the optimum value of x at ambient pressure is found to be x_{\rm max}\!=\!0.21 with T_{\rm cmax}\!=\!105.7 K, i.e., slightly lower than the maximum value reported previously.6,7

Figure 3 shows typical superconducting transitions for the x\!=\!0.2 sample at two different pressures. The resistance curves are normalized with respect to their values measured at 80 K. As indicated on the 2.5 GPa curve in Fig. 3, the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} is defined as the intersection of the tangent through the inflection point of the resistive transition with a straight line fit of the normal state just above the transition. A clear shift of T_{c} towards higher values is observed in going from 2.5 GPa to 10.8 GPa.

Above T_{c} the resistance increases with decreasing temperature. This is attributed to the presence of intergrain boundaries in these samples, which have a measured density of the order of 55-65 % of the theoretical density, and hence is not related to superconductivity at all. From scanning electron microscopy the grain sizes are found to be approximately 1 \mum for all the compositions investigated in this

Figure 2: The superconducting transition temperature T_{c} of Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca1-x,Y4Cu2O7 vs yttrium content x at ambient pressure.

The solid line is a parabolic fit (see text) to the experimental data.

  work. This background fortunately has only a very limited effect upon the determination of T_{c}.

The T_{c} values obtained for all four samples are plotted as a function of pressure in Fig. 4. A parabolic pressure dependence of T_{c} is found for all samples except for the one with x\!=\!0.0. This sample shows an approximate linear T_{c} vs p dependence. For the nearly optimal doped sample (x\!=\!0.2) T_{c} reaches a maximum value of 112 K at \sim\!8 GPa. A further increase in pressure only leads to a decrease in T_{c} . A similar behavior is also seen in the x\!=\!0.1 and x\!=\!0.35 samples.

In agreement with Eq. (2), the quadratic function

\[T_{c}(p)\!=\!b_{0}\!+\!b_{1}p+b_{2}p^{2}\] (3)

was used to fit the experimental data for each compound with different yttrium content x in Fig. 4 where T_{c} is expressed in K and p in GPa. The fit parameters b_{i} are given in Table 1, the corresponding curves are the solid lines shown in Fig. 4. These fits will now be used to construct a single function T_{c}(x,p) which describes all the data of Fig. 4. As a first step parabolas such as the one shown in Fig. 2, which holds for ambient pressure, are constructed at various pressures; i.e., the relation

\[T_{c}(x)\!=\!a_{0}\!+\!a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}\] (4)

is constructed for p\!=\!0.2, ...,20 GPa. Since in general the increment in pressure in the experiment is not constant, at each given pressure for all four x values the corresponding T_{c} values are obtained by the interpolation of Eq. (3) of which the appropriate coefficients are given in Table 1.

As a result the fit parameters a_{i} are obtained at all pressure values considered. To obtain a single function T_{c}(x,p), a smooth function can be fitted to the parameters T_{\rm{cmax}}, \beta^{\rm{n}}, and x_{\rm{max}} as a function of pressure after rewriting Eq. (4) as follows:

\[T_{c}(x,p) = \!\left(\!a_{0}\!-\!\frac{a_{1}^{2}}{4\,a_{2}}\!\right)\!\left[1 \!-\!\left(\frac{-a_{2}}{a_{0}\!-\!(a_{1}^{2}\!/\!4a_{2})}\!\right)\!\left(x \!+\!\frac{a_{1}}{2\,a_{2}}\!\right)^{2}\right]\] (5) \[= T_{\rm{cmax}}(p)\{1\!-\!\beta^{\rm  while the sharp dropoff at the upper right corner in Fig. 6 is reduced: the position of the 75 K isotherm as shown would then represent a 90 K isotherm.

Now Fig. 5 will be discussed in more detail. The pressure dependence of T_{c\max}, which represents the intrinsic pressure dependence of T_{c}, shows a maximum around 8 GPa, consistent with Fig. 4. In general, a maximum for T_{c\max} as a function of pressure would be expected: due to the stronger coupling between CuO_{2} layers T_{c} increases until the layers are too close and deformation or other detrimental effects take over. The parameter \beta^{*} defines the width of the parabola shown in Fig. 2, and corresponding ones at higher pressures. The increase of \beta^{*} with pressure implies a slight narrowing of the parabola, which means that T_{c} is more sensitively dependent upon doping, but also that the compound is superconducting in a narrower range of doping. In principle the parameter x_{\max} contains two contributions due to (i) the effect of doping by Y^{\,3+}, Pb^{\,4+} and oxygen deficiency and (ii) the fact that the ambient pressure maximum of T_{c} vs n_{h} is not at n_{h} = 0 but at n_{h} = n_{h\max} \approx 0.16. Incidentally, as explained above there is practically no oxygen deficiency in these compounds and doping due to it can be ignored. The pressure dependence of x_{\max} also contains these two contributions: the pressure-induced shift in n_{h\max} and in doping by Y^{\,3+} and Pb^{\,4+}. Regrettably these two contributions cannot be separated in the present experiment.

It is of course interesting to try and relate x to n_{h} ; first the zero-pressure case is considered. As the high-T_{c} superconductors are usually considered to be _ionic_,[4] charges can be assigned to each of the constituent cations (metal ions) and anions (oxygen ions) which are represented as point charges. Assigning the nominal vacancies to the _ionic_ constituents of Tl_{0.5}Pb_{0.5}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Y_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7}, i.e., Tl^{\,3+}, Pb^{\,4+}, Sr^{\,2+}, Ca^{\,2+}, Y^{\,3+}, Cu^{\,2+}, and O^{\,2-}, the number of holes per CuO_{2} layer per copper atom would be given by

\[n_{h} = 0.25 - \frac{x}{2}.\]

The validity of this relation can be easily checked. The parabola given by Eq. (1) yields precisely T_{c} = 0 for n_{h} = n_{h\max} \pm\sqrt{1/\beta}. The width of the parabola at its base is thus given by \Delta n_{h} = 2 \sqrt{1/\beta}; it is well known [20] that \Delta n_{h} \approx 0.22. Using the fit to the experimental data in Fig. 2 it is found that \Delta x = 0.8, where \Delta x is defined analogously to \Delta n_{h}. As a first approximation n_{h} = const+ (\Delta n_{h}/\Delta x)x or after substituting the values for \Delta n_{h} and \Delta x given above:

\[n_{h} = \mathrm{const} - \frac{x}{3.6}.\]

Comparing this relation to Eq. (6), it becomes clear that the CuO_{2} layers in this particular system benefit only from about half of the chemical doping. Possibly some charge is trapped elsewhere, or not all Y^{\,3+} replaces Ca^{\,2+}.

Now the magnitude of \partial n_{h}/\partial p close to zero pressure is discussed. If the initial slope \partial x_{\max}/\partial p is entirely attributed to a change in the hole concentration n_{h} (to obtain an upper bound) then it is found that \partial n_{h}/\partial p \approx 3.9 \times10^{\,-\,4} GPa^{\,-\,1}, close to the value of 5\times10^{\,-\,4} GPa^{\,-\,1} found [42, 43, 44, 45, 46] for CaLaBaCuO_{7}. Both CaLaBaCu_{3}O_{7} and

Figure 6: Contour plot of T_{c}(x,p). The maximum T_{c} which can be reached in this particular system is 112 K. This value can be reached only under pressure and at optimal yttrium content (x = 0.21).

  {\rm Tl}_{0.5}{\rm Pb}_{0.5}{\rm Sr}_{2}{\rm Ca}_{1-x}{\rm Y}_{x}{\rm Cu}_{2}{\rm O}_{7} have a special crystal structure. In CaLaBaCu_{3}O_{7} the doping of the CuO_{2} layers is provided by the CuO chains, which are very short due to the formation of very small crystallites which make CaLaBaCu_{3}O_{7} macroscopically tetragonal.[42] Gupta and Gupta[47] have calculated that this severely hinders the transfer of charge and hence \delta n_{h}/\partial p is expected to have a small value. In {\rm Tl}_{0.5}{\rm Pb}_{0.5}{\rm Sr}_{2}{\rm Ca}_{1-x}{\rm Y}_{x}{\rm Cu}_{2}{ \rm O}_{7} the doping is provided by the (Tl,Pb)-O layers, which are also known to be of irregular nature. Due to this, charge transfer from the (Tl,Pb)-O layers to the CuO_{2} layers is frustrated. Hence it is considered likely that in {\rm Tl}_{0.5}{\rm Pb}_{0.5}{\rm Sr}_{2}{\rm Ca}_{1-x}{\rm Y}_{x}{\rm Cu}_{2}{ \rm O}_{7} pressure-induced doping of the CuO_{2} layers is very small, although it cannot be ruled out that the change in doping from the (Tl,Pb)-O layers and the pressure-induced shift in n_{h\max} accidentally cancel. A small value for \delta n_{h}/\partial p implies that pressure-induced charge transfer would have a small effect on T_{c} . Hence the extrinsic value of \delta T_{c}/\partial p is small in this particular system.
