###### Abstract

We carried out high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements on the electronic structure and superconducting gap of K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} (T_{c} = 32 K) and (Tl_{0.45}K_{0.43})Fe_{1.84}Se_{2} (T_{c} = 28 K) superconductors. In addition to the electron-like Fermi surface near \Omega/\pi,\pi,\pi by electron-like Fermi pockets are revealed around the zone center \Gamma(0,0) in K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2}. This observation makes the Fermi surface topology of K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} consistent with that of (Tl, Rb),Fe_{2.7}Se_{2} and (Tl, K),Fe_{2.7}Se_{2} compounds. A nearly isotropic superconducting gap \Delta is observed along the electron-like Fermi pocket near the M point in K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} (\Delta\sim 9 meV) and (Tl_{0.45}K_{0.34})Fe_{1.84}Se_{2} (\Delta\sim 8 meV). The establishment of a universal picture on the Fermi surface topology and superconducting gap in the A_{x}Fe_{2.7}Se_{2} (A = K, Tl, Cs, Rb, etc.) superconductors will provide important information for understanding the superconductivity of iron-based superconductors.

The latest discovery of superconductivity with a T_{c} above 30 K in a A_{x}Fe_{2.7}-,Se_{2} (A = K, Tl, Cs, Rb, etc.) system [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 5  to the sample. The K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} and (Tl_{0.45}K_{0.34})Fe_{1.84}Se_{2} single crystals were grown by the Bridgeman method.[5] The composition of the crystals were analyzed by the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. Electrical resistivity and dc magnetic susceptibility measurements show that the crystals exhibit a sharp superconducting transition at T_{c}\sim 32 K (transition width of \sim1 K) for K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} and T_{c}\sim 28 K (transition width of \sim1 K) for (Tl_{0.45}K_{0.34})Fe_{1.84}Se_{2}. The crystal was cleaved _in situ_ and measured in vacuum with a base pressure better than 5\times 10^{-11} Torr.

Figure 1 shows the Fermi surface mapping of the K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} [Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)] and (Tl_{0.45}K_{0.34})Fe_{1.84}Se_{2} [Figs. 1(c)] superconductors. The band structure of K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} along two typical high-symmetry cuts are shown in Fig. 2. An electron-like Fermi surface is clearly observed and M(\pi,\pi) similar to previous ARPES results on K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2},[22, 23] (Tl, Rb)_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2},[24] and (Tl, K)_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}.[25] Near the \Gamma point, a tiny Fermi pocket (denoted as \alpha) is obvious which is possibly formed by an electron-like band with its bottom nearly touching the Fermi level. In addition, one can observe a rather weak but discernible electron-like Fermi surface sheet (denoted as \beta) near \Gamma in both K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} [Figs. 1(a), 1(b), and 1(d)] and (Tl_{0.45}K_{0.34})Fe_{1.84}Se_{2} [Figs. 1(c) and 1(e)], with its size being

(c) Fermi surface mapping of (Tl_{0.45}K_{0.34})Fe_{1.84}Se_{2} superconductor with the electric vector of the incident light along the diagonal direction. In all cases, the data around \Gamma are mirror-symmetric with respect to the (0,0)-(\pi,\pi) line while the data around four equivalent M points (for the sake of clarity, we refer to the four equivalent M points in the first Brillouin zone as M1, M2, M3, and M4) are obtained by symmetrizing one original datum at one particular M point. Near the M point, one Fermi surface sheet is clearly observed [marked as \gamma in (a)]. Near the \Gamma(0,0) point, in addition to a tiny Fermi pocket observed and which is marked as \alpha, a weak large Fermi surface sheet (marked as \beta) is also discernible. (d) Zoomed region around \Gamma point in (a) shown in gray scale to show the weak \beta band more clearly. (e) Zoomed region around \Gamma point in (c) shown in gray scale to show the weak \beta band. In both cases, the weak \beta bands can be better observed.

(b) Corresponding EDC second-derivative image of Fig. 2(a). The two Fermi crossings of the \beta band (\beta_{\rm{R}} and \beta_{\rm{R}}) are marked.

The photoemission spectra (EDCs) corresponding to Cut 1, Cut 2, and Cut 3 are shown in (g), (h), and (i), respectively.

  similar to that of the electron-like pocket near M. We also notice that the spectral weight distribution of the observed Fermi surface sheets is sensitive to the electric vector of the incident light, as seen by comparing Fig. 1(a) with Fig. 1(b).

The existence of the \beta Fermi pocket near the \Gamma point in K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} can also be identified from the measured band structure [Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)]. We note that the feature of the \beta band [Fig. 2(a)] and its associated Fermi surface [Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)] near \Gamma are rather weak in K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2}; much weaker than in (Tl, Rb)_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}[24]. This is probably why it was not revealed before.[22, 23] We also notice that the band structure of K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} near the \Gamma point [Figs. 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), and 2(d)] presents some interesting features. As shown in Fig. 2(b), in addition to the electron-like \alpha band and the electron-like \beta band, at least two more bands are clearly present within the measured energy window. The observation of the hole-like GB band is consistent with other measurements on K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}[22, 23] and is also commonly observed in (Tl, Rb)_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}[24] and (Tl, K)_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}[25]. However, the presence of a GA band is very clear in our measurement [Figs. 2(b) and 2(d)], and was not observed in the previous measurements.[22, 23] This GA band is important when comparing the experimental results with the band-structure calculations and considering electron scatterings between various bands.

The observation of two electron-like Fermi pockets, \alpha and \beta, around \Gamma in K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} is interesting. It is distinct from other Fe-based compounds where hole-like Fermi surface sheets are expected around the \Gamma point.[19, 27] It is also different from band-structure calculations[16, 17, 18, 22, 23] and previous ARPES measurements[22, 23] on K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} that only suggest the disappearance of hole-like Fermi surface sheets near the \Gamma point. It is now consistent with the ARPES measurements on (Tl, Rb)_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}[24] and (Tl, K)_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}[25].

Panels (e)–(h) show, respectively, the high-resolution Fermi surface mapping near M2, EDCs along the Fermi surface, their corresponding symmetrized EDCs, and the obtained momentum-dependent superconducting gap for the (Tl_{0.45}K_{0.34})Fe_{1.84}Se_{2} superconductor.

(f) Photoemission spectra measured at different temperatures at the Fermi crossing \mathrm{k_{F}} of the \gamma band, as marked in (a). (g) Corresponding symmetrized EDCs of (f).

  to provide a general picture on the Fermi surface topology in the A_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} (A = K, Tl, Cs, Rb, etc.) superconductors.

Now we turn to investigate the superconducting gap in the K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} and (Tb_{1.045}K_{0.34})Fe_{1.84}Se_{2} superconductors. Since the \beta feature near \Gamma is too weak to give reasonable information on the superconducting gap, we will focus in this paper on the superconducting gap along the \gamma Fermi surface near M. Figures 3(a)- 3(e) show the photoemission images measured on K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} along a cut near M [its location is shown in the bottom-left inset of Fig. 3(h)] at different temperatures. The photoemission spectra (energy distribution curves; EDCs) on the Fermi momentum at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 3(f). To visually inspect a possible gap opening and remove the effect of the Fermi distribution function near the Fermi level, these original EDCs are symmetrized to get spectra in Fig. 3(g), by following the procedure that is commonly used in high-temperature cuprate superconductors.[28] As seen from Fig. 3(g), there is a clear superconducting gap opening below T_{c}\sim 32 K which is closed above T_{c}. The superconducting gap size is extracted from the peak position of the symmetrized EDCs in this paper[28] [Fig. 3(g)]; it is \sim9 meV at 12 K and its temperature dependence roughly follows the BCS-type form [Fig. 3(h)].

In order to measure the momentum dependence of the superconducting gap, we took high-resolution Fermi surface mapping of the \gamma Fermi pocket at M for K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} [Fig. 4(a)] and (Tb_{0.45}K_{0.34})Fe_{1.84}Se_{2} [Fig. 4(e)] superconductors. Figure 4(b) shows photoemission spectra around the \gamma Fermi pocket [Fig. 4(a)] measured in the superconducting state (T = 15 K); the corresponding symmetrized photoemission spectra are shown in Fig. 4(c). The superconducting gap [Fig. 4(d)], extracted by picking up the peak position of the symmetrized EDCs [Fig. 4(c)], is nearly isotropic with a size of (9\pm 2) meV. By the same procedure, the superconducting gap around the \gamma Fermi pocket near M for the (Tb_{0.45}K_{0.34})Fe_{1.84}Se_{2} superconductor [Fig. 4(h)] is also nearly isotropic with a size of (8\pm 2) meV.

In summary, we have identified two electron-like Fermi pockets near the \Gamma point in the K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} and (Tb_{1.045}K_{0.34})Fe_{1.84}Se_{2} superconductors. This has established a consistent picture on the Fermi surface topology in the A_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} (A = K, Tl, Cs, Rb, etc.) superconductors. The distinct Fermi surface topology in the A_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} superconductors definitely asks for reevaluation of the pairing mechanisms, based on electron scatterings between the bands near \Gamma and the bands near M, that were proposed before for other Fe-based superconductors.[19, 20] We have observed a nearly isotropic superconducting gap around the \gamma Fermi pocket near the M point in K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} (\Delta\sim 9 meV) and (Tb_{1.045}K_{0.34})Fe_{1.84}Se_{2} (\Delta\sim 8 meV). These are consistent with other ARPES measurements[23, 24, 25] and build a general picture of an isotropic superconducting gap along the \gamma Fermi surface near M. These results, together with the observation of a nearly isotropic superconducting gap along the \beta pocket near \Gamma,[24, 25] indicate that the A_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} superconductors are nodeless in their gap structure, a fact that appears to favor an s-wave symmetry or a nodeless d-wave symmetry.[14, 15] This rich information on the Fermi surface topology and the associated superconducting gap will provide crucial information and constraints on understanding the superconductivity mechanism in the Fe-based superconductors.

In all cases, the data around \Gamma are mirror-symmetric with respect to the (0,0)-(\pi,\pi) line while the data around four equivalent M points (for the sake of clarity, we refer to the four equivalent M points in the first Brillouin zone as M1, M2, M3, and M4) are obtained by symmetrizing one original datum at one particular M point. Near the M point, one Fermi surface sheet is clearly observed [marked as \gamma in (a)]. Near the \Gamma(0,0) point, in addition to a tiny Fermi pocket observed and which is marked as \alpha, a weak large Fermi surface sheet (marked as \beta) is also discernible. (d) Zoomed region around \Gamma point in (a) shown in gray scale to show the weak \beta band more clearly. (e) Zoomed region around \Gamma point in (c) shown in gray scale to show the weak \beta band. In both cases, the weak \beta bands can be better observed.

  similar to that of the electron-like pocket near M. We also notice that the spectral weight distribution of the observed Fermi surface sheets is sensitive to the electric vector of the incident light, as seen by comparing Fig. 1(a) with Fig. 1(b).

The existence of the \beta Fermi pocket near the \Gamma point in K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} can also be identified from the measured band structure [Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)]. We note that the feature of the \beta band [Fig. 2(a)] and its associated Fermi surface [Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)] near \Gamma are rather weak in K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2}; much weaker than in (Tl, Rb)_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}[24]. This is probably why it was not revealed before.[22, 23] We also notice that the band structure of K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} near the \Gamma point [Figs. 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), and 2(d)] presents some interesting features. As shown in Fig. 2(b), in addition to the electron-like \alpha band and the electron-like \beta band, at least two more bands are clearly present within the measured energy window. The observation of the hole-like GB band is consistent with other measurements on K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}[22, 23] and is also commonly observed in (Tl, Rb)_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}[24] and (Tl, K)_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}[25]. However, the presence of a GA band is very clear in our measurement [Figs. 2(b) and 2(d)], and was not observed in the previous measurements.[22, 23] This GA band is important when comparing the experimental results with the band-structure calculations and considering electron scatterings between various bands.

The observation of two electron-like Fermi pockets, \alpha and \beta, around \Gamma in K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} is interesting. It is distinct from other Fe-based compounds where hole-like Fermi surface sheets are expected around the \Gamma point.[19, 27] It is also different from band-structure calculations[16, 17, 18, 22, 23] and previous ARPES measurements[22, 23] on K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} that only suggest the disappearance of hole-like Fermi surface sheets near the \Gamma point. It is now consistent with the ARPES measurements on (Tl, Rb)_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}[24] and (Tl, K)_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}[25].

Now we turn to investigate the superconducting gap in the K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} and (Tb_{1.045}K_{0.34})Fe_{1.84}Se_{2} superconductors. Since the \beta feature near \Gamma is too weak to give reasonable information on the superconducting gap, we will focus in this paper on the superconducting gap along the \gamma Fermi surface near M. Figures 3(a)- 3(e) show the photoemission images measured on K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} along a cut near M [its location is shown in the bottom-left inset of Fig. 3(h)] at different temperatures. The photoemission spectra (energy distribution curves; EDCs) on the Fermi momentum at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 3(f). To visually inspect a possible gap opening and remove the effect of the Fermi distribution function near the Fermi level, these original EDCs are symmetrized to get spectra in Fig. 3(g), by following the procedure that is commonly used in high-temperature cuprate superconductors.[28] As seen from Fig. 3(g), there is a clear superconducting gap opening below T_{c}\sim 32 K which is closed above T_{c}. The superconducting gap size is extracted from the peak position of the symmetrized EDCs in this paper[28] [Fig. 3(g)]; it is \sim9 meV at 12 K and its temperature dependence roughly follows the BCS-type form [Fig. 3(h)].

In order to measure the momentum dependence of the superconducting gap, we took high-resolution Fermi surface mapping of the \gamma Fermi pocket at M for K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} [Fig. 4(a)] and (Tb_{0.45}K_{0.34})Fe_{1.84}Se_{2} [Fig. 4(e)] superconductors. Figure 4(b) shows photoemission spectra around the \gamma Fermi pocket [Fig. 4(a)] measured in the superconducting state (T = 15 K); the corresponding symmetrized photoemission spectra are shown in Fig. 4(c). The superconducting gap [Fig. 4(d)], extracted by picking up the peak position of the symmetrized EDCs [Fig. 4(c)], is nearly isotropic with a size of (9\pm 2) meV. By the same procedure, the superconducting gap around the \gamma Fermi pocket near M for the (Tb_{0.45}K_{0.34})Fe_{1.84}Se_{2} superconductor [Fig. 4(h)] is also nearly isotropic with a size of (8\pm 2) meV.

In summary, we have identified two electron-like Fermi pockets near the \Gamma point in the K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} and (Tb_{1.045}K_{0.34})Fe_{1.84}Se_{2} superconductors. This has established a consistent picture on the Fermi surface topology in the A_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} (A = K, Tl, Cs, Rb, etc.) superconductors. The distinct Fermi surface topology in the A_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} superconductors definitely asks for reevaluation of the pairing mechanisms, based on electron scatterings between the bands near \Gamma and the bands near M, that were proposed before for other Fe-based superconductors.[19, 20] We have observed a nearly isotropic superconducting gap around the \gamma Fermi pocket near the M point in K_{0.68}Fe_{1.79}Se_{2} (\Delta\sim 9 meV) and (Tb_{1.045}K_{0.34})Fe_{1.84}Se_{2} (\Delta\sim 8 meV). These are consistent with other ARPES measurements[23, 24, 25] and build a general picture of an isotropic superconducting gap along the \gamma Fermi surface near M. These results, together with the observation of a nearly isotropic superconducting gap along the \beta pocket near \Gamma,[24, 25] indicate that the A_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} superconductors are nodeless in their gap structure, a fact that appears to favor an s-wave symmetry or a nodeless d-wave symmetry.[14, 15] This rich information on the Fermi surface topology and the associated superconducting gap will provide crucial information and constraints on understanding the superconductivity mechanism in the Fe-based superconductors.
