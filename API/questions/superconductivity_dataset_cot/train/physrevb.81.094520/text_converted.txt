###### Abstract

The in-plane thermal conductivity κ of overdoped FeAs-based
superconductor BaFe_(1.73)Co_(0.27)As₂ (T_(c) = 8.1 K) single crystal
was measured down to 80 mK. In zero field, the residual linear term κ₀/T
is negligible, suggesting a nodeless superconducting gap in the ab
plane. In magnetic field, κ₀/T increases rapidly, very different from
that of conventional s-wave superconductors. This anomalous κ₀/T(H) may
reveal an exotic superconducting gap structure in overdoped
BaFe_(1.73)Co_(0.27)As₂: the vanishing hole (β) pocket has a much larger
gap than the electron (γ and δ) pockets which contain most of the
carriers. Such an exotic gap structure is an evidence for
superconducting state induced by interband interactions, in which the
band with the _smaller_ density of states has a _larger_ gap.

## I Introduction

For the recently discovered FeAs-based high-T_(c) superconductors,[1, 2,
3, 4, 5] the pairing symmetry of its superconducting gap remains the
most important issue to resolve. Although extensive experimental and
theoretical work have been done, there is still no consensus.[6, 7]
While angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments
clearly demonstrated nearly isotropic multigaps,[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
the Andreev spectroscopy,[14, 15, 16] NMR,[17, 18, 19, 20] and
penetration depth experiments[21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] gave conflicting
claims on whether there are nodes in the superconducting gaps.

Low-temperature thermal conductivity measurement is a powerful bulk tool
to probe the superconducting gap structure.[27] The residual linear term
κ₀/T is very sensitive to the existence of gap nodes and the field
dependence of κ₀/T can give useful information on multigaps. Very
recently, several heat transport studies have been done on this new
family of FeAs-based and related superconductors. For the hole-doped
Ba_(1.73)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ (T_(c)= 30 K) (Ref. [28]) and electron-doped
BaFe_(1.9)Ni_(0.13)As₂ (T_(c)= 20.3 K),[29] a negligible κ₀/T was found
in zero field, indicating a full superconducting gap. By contrast, a
large κ₀/T was observed in BaFe_(1.86)Co_(0.14)As₂.[30] For the
prototype FeSe_(x) (T_(c)= 8.8 K) superconductor, the thermal
conductivity shows clear behavior of multiple nodeless superconducting
gaps.[31] In two superconductors with lower T_(c), κ₀/T of BaNi₂As₂
(T_(c)= 0.7 K) is consistent with a dirty fully gapped
superconductivity,[32] while LaFePO (T_(c)= 7.4 K) appears to have a
finite κ₀/T, suggesting the gap on some band may have nodes.[33]

For the most interested hole- and electron-doped BaFe₂As₂
superconductors, all samples studied by heat transport so far are near
optimal doping.[28, 29, 30] It will be very interesting to study highly
underdoped and overdoped samples to demonstrate its superconducting gap
structure over the whole doping range. Furthermore, due to the high
T_(c) and H_(c2) of optimally doped samples, magnetic field can only be
applied up to about 30

In this paper, we measure the thermal conductivity κ of a highly
overdoped BaFe_(1.73)Co_(0.27)As₂ single crystal with T_(c)= 8.1 K down
to 80 mK. In zero field, the residual linear term κ₀/T is negligible,
suggesting a nodeless superconducting gap, at least in ab plane. In
magnetic field, κ₀/T(H) increases sharply, very different from the
Ba_(1.73)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ and BaFe_(1.9)Ni_(0.13)As₂ samples near optimal
doping. Such an anomalous κ₀/T(H) likely results from an exotic
superconducting gap structure in overdoped BaFe_(1.73)Co_(0.27)As₂: the
vanishing hole (β) pocket has a much larger gap than the electron (γ and
δ) pockets which contain most of the carriers. Our finding of this
exotic gap structure supports the s_(±)-wave superconducting state
induced by interband interactions in FeAs-based superconductors.

## II Experimental

Single crystals with nominal formula BaFe_(1.7)Co_(0.3)As₂ were prepared
by self-flux method.[34] The diamagnetic superconducting transition was
measured by a vibrating sample magnetometer based on a physical property
measurement system (PPMS of Quantum Design) with the magnetic field
perpendicular to the ab plane of the crystals. Energy-dispersive of
x-ray microanalysis (Hitach S-4800) show that the actual Co content is
0.27. The sample was cleaved to a rectangular shape of dimensions 2.1×
1.4 mm² in the ab plane with 25 μm thickness along the c axis. Contacts
were made directly on the fresh sample surfaces with silver paint, which
were used for both resistivity and thermal conductivity measurements.
The contacts are metallic with typical resistance 150 mΩ at 1.5 K.
In-plane thermal conductivity was measured in a dilution refrigerator
down to 80 mK, using a standard four-wire steady-state method with two
RuO₂ chip thermometers, calibrated _in situ_ against a reference RuO₂
thermometer. Magnetic fields were applied along the c axis and
perpendicular to the heat current. To ensure a homogeneous field
distribution in the sample, all fields were applied at temperature above
T_(c).

## III Results and discussion

Figure 1 shows the in-plane resistivity of our BaFe_(1.73)Co_(0.27)As₂
single crystal in H=0 and 14.5 T. The zero-resistance point of the
resistive transition is at T_(c) =8.1 K in zero field, which is
consistent with the diamagnetic superconducting transition shown in the
inset of Fig. 1. The residual resistivity ρ₀=64.8 μΩ cm is extrapolated
from the H=14.5 T data between 10 and 30 K by using the Fermi-liquid
form ρ=ρ₀+AT².

To estimate the upper critical field H_(c2)(0) which completely
suppresses the resistive transition, we define T_(c)(onset) at the
temperature where ρ(T) deviates from the T² dependence, and get
T_(c)(onset)=13.0 and 5.0 K for H=0 and 14.5 T, respectively. Using the
relationship H_(c2)/H_(c2)(0)=1−[T/T_(c)(0)]², H_(c2)(0)=17.0 T is
obtained.

In Fig. 2, the temperature dependence of the in-plane thermal
conductivity for BaFe_(1.73)Co_(0.27)As₂ in H=0, 1, 2, 4, 9, and 14.5 T
magnetic fields are plotted as κ/T vs T. All the curves are roughly
linear, therefore we fit the data to κ/T=a+bT^(α − 1) (Refs. 35 and 36)
with α fixed to 2. The two terms aT and bT^(α) represent electronic and
phonon contributions, respectively. In the phonon term, the value of α
is usually between 2 and 3, due to specular reflection of phonons at the
smooth crystal surfaces in the boundary scattering limit at low
temperature. [35, 36] Previously, α=2.22 and 2.02 were observed in
BaFe₂As₂ (Ref. 37) and BaFe_(1.9)Ni_(0.1)As₂ (Ref. 29) single crystals,
respectively. Here we only focus on the electronic term.

In zero field, the fitting gives residual linear term κ₀/T=−3 ± 9 μW K⁻²
cm⁻¹. This value of κ₀/T is within the experimental error bar ±5 μW K⁻²
cm⁻¹, [36] although the fitting error bar is a little high due to the
slight noise of the data. Even after considering these error bars, the
κ₀/T is still less than 3

In H=9 and 14.5 T magnetic fields, κ₀/T=0.365 ± 0.009 mW K⁻² cm⁻¹ and
0.366 ± 0.009 mW K⁻² cm⁻¹ were obtained from the fittings, respectively.
For both values, one gets the Lorenz ratio L=ρ₀κ₀/T=0.97 ± 0.03L₀, which
shows that Wiedemann-Franz law is roughly satisfied within the
experimental error bar. Note that in the nonsuperconducting parent
BaFe₂As₂ single crystal, the Wiedemann-Franz law was found to be
satisfied as T→. [37]

The saturation of thermal conductivity in H>9 T suggests that the bulk
H_(c2) has been reached at H=9 T, although the resistive transition is
not completely suppressed until H_(c2)=17 T. Similar situation happened
in overdoped cuprate superconductor Tl-2201 with T_(c)=15 K, in which
H_(c2)=13 T was obtained from the resistivity data, while bulk H_(c2)=7
T was determined from the thermal conductivity data. [39] Here we take
bulk H_(c2)=9 T for overdoped BaFe_(1.73)Co_(0.27)As₂. To choose a
slightly different bulk H_(c2) does not affect our discussions below.

In Fig. 3, the normalized κ₀/T of BaFe_(1.73)Co_(0.27)As₂ is plotted as
a function of H/H_(c2), together with the clean s-wave superconductor
Nb, [40] the dirty s-wave superconduct

ing alloy InBi,[41] the multiband s-wave superconductor NbSe₂,[42] an
overdoped sample of the d-wave superconductor Tl-2201,[39] and
BaFe_(1.9)Ni_(0.1)As₂.[29] As seen in Fig. 3, the rapid increase in κ₀/T
at low field for overdoped BaFe_(1.75)Co_(0.27)As₂ is clearly different
from the optimally doped BaFe_(1.9)Ni_(0.1)As₂. In fact, it looks more
like the typical behavior of d-wave superconductors, due to the Volovik
effect.[43] However, the negligible κ₀/T in zero field, which means
nodeless superconducting gap, has excluded d-wave gap in
BaFe_(1.75)Co_(0.27)As₂.

For s-wave superconductor NbSe₂, κ₀/T is zero in H=0, but it also
increases rapidly at low field, unlike Nb and InBi. This has be
explained by its multigap structure: the gap on the Γ band is
approximately one third of the gap on the other two Fermi surfaces and
magnetic field first suppresses the superconductivity on the Fermi
surface with smaller gap [given that H_(c2)(0) × Δ₀²].[42] Therefore,
the even sharper increase in κ₀/T(H) in BaFe_(1.75)Co_(0.27)As₂ may
result from an extreme case of multigap structure, in which the gap of
one band is much smaller than others (e.g., 1/4 or 1/5). However, there
is an apparent difference between NbSe₂ and BaFe_(1.75)Co_(0.27)As₂. For
NbSe₂, after the smaller gap was suppressed, κ₀/T(H) shows a slight
downward curvature at high field due to the larger gap. Similar
curvature of κ₀/T(H) was found in MgB₂.[44] In Fig. 3, κ₀/T(H) of
BaFe_(1.75)Co_(0.27)As₂ increases so rapidly and it does not show
downward curvature at high field. Such an anomalous κ₀/T(H) has never
been seen before. If it indeed results from multiple nodeless gaps, the
bands with smaller gaps must contain most of the carriers so that
κ₀/T(H) can increase so rapidly all the way to high field.

To investigate this possibility, we have examined the band structure and
superconducting gaps in doped BaFe₂As₂ system, revealed by ARPES
experiments.[8, 12, 3, 45] From the hole-doped side, in
Ba_(0.6)K_(0.8)Fe₂As₂ (T_(c)=37 K), the average gap values Δ(0) for the
two hole (α and β) pockets at the Γ point are 12.5 meV and 5.5 meV,
respectively, while for the electron (γ and δ) pockets at the M point,
the gap value is about 12.5 meV.[8, 12] For electron-doped
BaFe_(1.85)Co_(0.15)As₂ (T_(c)=25.5 K) at optimal doping, the inner hole
(α) pocket disappears, and the average gap values Δ(0) of hole (β) and
electron (γ and δ) pockets are 6.6 meV and 5.0 meV, respectively.[13]
Such nearly isotropic multigps with similar size has been used to
explain the slow field dependence of κ₀/T up to 30

In the BCS theory, larger density of states (DOS) usually leads to a
larger superconducting gap Δ(0). Therefore it is counterintuitive that
the vanishing β pocket with much smaller DOS ends up with a much larger
gap. However, in the theory of interband superconductivity,[47] this is
exactly the result of the interband-only pairing, since the pairing
amplitude on one band is generated by the DOS on the other.

Right after the discovery of T_(c)=26 K superconductivity in
LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x)[1] the importance of interband pairing interaction
has been emphasized due to the multiband fermiology.[48, 49] The
interaction, possibly via antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, connects
the well-separated Fermi-surface pockets located around Γ and around M,
and gives extended s-wave pairing symmetry whose order parameter has
opposite sign on the electron and hole pockets.[48, 49, 50] Although the
relative strength of interband and intraband pairing interactions is
still under debate,[47, 48, 49, 50] the experimentally observed
different 2Δ/k_(B)T_(c) values on different Fermi-surface pocket in
Ba_(0.6)K_(0.4)Fe₂As₂ and BaFe_(1.85)Co_(0.15)As₂ prefer the interband
pairing mechanism.[13]

Quantitatively, in the interband-only pairing model, the gap ratio
$\Delta_{2}/\Delta_{1}\!=\!\sqrt{N_{1}/N_{2}}$, with N₁ and N₂ the
Fermi-level density of states.[47] In this sense, our overdoped
BaFe_(1.75)Co_(0.27)As₂ sample has provided the best testing ground for
the theory of interband superconductivity, due to its biggest difference
of DOS between the hole and electron pockets in doped BaFe₂As₂
superconductors so far. Indeed, the results of our current work have
given strong support for the interband superconductivity in FeAs-based
superconductors. It will be very interesting to directly measure the
superconducting gaps in our overdoped BaFe_(1.75)Co_(0.27)As₂ sample
with ARPES, which needs to be done at temperature below the T_(c)=8.1 K.

## IV Summary

In summary, we have used low-temperature thermal conductivity to clearly
demonstrate nodeless superconducting

clean s-wave superconductor Nb (Ref. [40]), the dirty s-wave
superconducting alloy InBi (Ref. [41]), the multiband s-wave
superconductor NbSe₂ (Ref. [42]), an overdoped sample of the d-wave
superconductor Tl-2201 (Ref. [39]), and BaFe_(1.9)Ni_(0.1)As₂ (Ref.
[29]) are also shown for comparison.

gap in overdoped iron-arsenide superconductor BaFe_(1.75)Co_(0.22)As₂.
Furthermore, the κ₀/T(H) increases sharply at low field, very different
from Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ and BaFe_(1.9)Ni_(0.1)As₂ near optimal
doping. It may reveal an exotic superconducting gap structure in
overdoped BaFe_(1.75)Co_(0.27)As₂; the vanishing hole (β) pocket has a
much larger gap than the electron (γ and δ) pockets, although the
electron pockets have much larger density of states. Such an exotic gap
structure is an evidence for the theory of interband superconductivity,
thus of great importance to understand the superconducting state in
FeAs-based superconductors.

_Note added._ During preparation of this manuscript (arXiv:0908.2209), a
similar work on BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂ was post online.[52] In Ref. [52],
the results of overdoped BaFe_(1.772)Co_(0.228)As₂ (T_(c)=10.1 K) are
consistent with ours, but the anomalous increase in κ₀/T(H) at low field
was explained by highly anisotropic superconducting gap with deep
minima. While this debate needs to be resolved by low-temperature ARPES
experiments, we note a very recent calculation of κ₀/T(H) with unequal
size of isotropic s_(x)-wave gaps has successfully fit the experimental
data,[53] thus supports our interpretation.
