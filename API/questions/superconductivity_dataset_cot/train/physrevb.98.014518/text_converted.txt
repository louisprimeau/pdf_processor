###### Abstract

The recently discovered (Rb,Cs)EuFe₄As₄ compounds exhibit an unusual
combination of superconductivity (T_(c) ∼ 35 K) and ferromagnetism
(T_(m) ∼ 15 K). We have performed a series of x-ray diffraction, ac
magnetic susceptibility, dc magnetization, and electrical resistivity
measurements on both RbEuFe₄As₄ and CsEuFe₄As₄ to pressures as high as
 ∼ 30 GPa. We find that the superconductivity onset is suppressed
monotonically by pressure while the magnetic transition is enhanced at
initial rates of dT_(m)/dP ∼ 1.7 K/GPa and 1.5 K/GPa for RbEuFe₄As₄ and
CsEuFe₄As₄, respectively. Near 7 GPa, T_(c) onset and T_(m) become
comparable. At higher pressures, signatures of bulk superconductivity
gradually disappear. Room-temperature x-ray diffraction measurements
suggest the onset of a transition from tetragonal (T) to a
half-collapsed-tetragonal (hcT) phase at  ∼ 10 GPa (RbEuFe₄As₄) and
 ∼ 12 GPa (CsEuFe₄As₄). The ability to tune T_(c) and T_(m) into
coincidence with relatively modest pressures highlights (Rb,Cs)EuFe₄As₄
compounds as ideal systems to study the interplay of superconductivity
and ferromagnetism.

## 1 Introduction

The iron-based superconductors crystallize in several closely related
crystal structures. The most recently discovered of these is the
so-called "1144" structure type, which was reported for compounds with
the formula AeAFe₄As₄, where Ae = Ca or Sr and A = K, Rb, or Cs [1].
These structures can be viewed as an ordered stacking of Fe₂As₂ layers
sandwiched between alternating layers of Ae and A. Unlike the closely
related "122" compounds such as BaFe₂As₂, which require doping or
pressure to exhibit high T_(c) values, the stoichiometric 1144 compounds
exhibit T_(c) ∼ 35 K at ambient pressure. Subsequently, it was found
that the same structure type forms when the alkaline earth element is
replaced by the rare earth element Eu, resulting in RbEuFe₄As₄ and
CsEuFe₄As₄[2, 3, 4].

The Eu variants of the 1144 structure exhibit an unusual coexistence of
superconductivity (T_(c) ∼ 35 K) and what is nominally ferromagnetism
(T_(m) ∼ 15 K). The large ordered moment of  ∼ 6.5μ_(B) per formula unit
is consistent with magnetism deriving from Eu²⁺ ions [3]. Mossbauer
spectroscopy measurements confirm that the magnetism derives from Eu²⁺
moments (which orient perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis), and
indicate that there is no magnetic order of Fe moments down to at least
2 K [5, 6]. A recent preprint concluded that the Eu magnetism is
quasi-2D in nature with strong magnetic fluctuation effects [7].
However, there are as yet no reports of, e.g., neutron scattering
measurements to establish the magnetic structure, so it is possible that
the order is a more complicated modulated structure, rather than simple
ferromagnetism [8, 9].

It is thought that superconductivity and magnetism are able to coexist
in these compounds because of a weak coupling between the Eu planes and
the FeAs planes. Weak coupling between superconductivity and the Eu
magnetism is confirmed by the fact that nonmagnetic CaRbFe₄As₄[1]
exhibits nearly the same T_(c) as RbEuFe₄As₄ and CsEuFe₄As₄.
Furthermore, a study of the (Eu_(1 − x)Ca_(x))RbFe₄As₄ series found that
while T_(m) vanishes with increasing Ca concentration, T_(c) remains
essentially constant [10]. The observations described above place the
(Rb,Cs)EuFe₄As₄ compounds in the class of local moment ferromagnetic
superconductors such as ErRh₄B₄[11] and Ho_(x)Mo₆S₈[12]. However, these
materials exhibit a destruction of the superconducting state at the
onset of ferromagnetism, unlike in (Rb,Cs)EuFe₄As₄. In contrast, the
uranium-based superconducting ferromagnets such as URhGe [13], UGe₂
(under pressure) [14], and UCoGe [15] show the onset of weak itinerant
ferromagnetism at temperatures above the superconducting T_(c). We use
the terminology ferromagnetic superconductor (FMS) to indicate
T_(c) > T_(m) and superconducting ferromagnet (SFM) to indicate
T_(m) > T_(c).

Experiments aimed at tuning the superconducting and magnetic transitions
via pressure, chemical substitution, and applied magnetic fields have
played a central role in our understanding of magnetic superconductors
[16, 17]. To date, there appear to be only two reports of chemical
substitution experiments on (Rb,Cs)EuFe₄As₄ compounds. In addition to
the Eu → Ca substitution study described above [10], Liu _et al._
explored the effect of Ni substitution on the Fe site [18]. Increasing
Ni concentration has little impact on the Eu magnetism, but produces the
emergence of possible spin density wave order at 5

High pressure experiments have the potential to tune T_(c) and T_(m)
without introducing intrinsic disorder. In this paper we report a series
of high pressure measurements on polycrystalline samples of both
RbEuFe₄As₄ and CsEuFe₄As₄. Using a combination of x-ray diffraction, dc
magnetization, ac magnetic susceptibility, and electrical resistivity
measurements, we have mapped the phase diagrams of both compounds to
pressures as high as ∼ 30 GPa.

## II Experimental Methods

Polycrystalline samples of RbEuFe₄As₄ and CsEuFe₄As₄ were synthesized as
previously reported [3, 4]. These samples were subjected to a variety of
high pressure measurements, each using different diamond anvil cells
(DACs). Pressure was determined via the fluorescence spectrum of small
pieces of ruby located inside the sample chamber, near the sample [19].
For measurements at low temperature, the pressure was measured _in situ_
at low temperature, thus avoiding potential errors in pressure
determination due to the changes in pressure that typically occur on
cooling from room to low temperature.

Angle-dispersive x-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments on RbEuFe₄As₄ and
CsEuFe₄As₄ powder samples were carried out at beamline 13BM-C (PX^(′)2),
Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory [20]. The
x-ray beam was monochromated with silicon (311) to 28.6 keV (0.434 A)
with 1 eV bandwidth. A Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror system was used to focus
the beam to 20 μm (vertical) × 15 μm (horizontal) (FWHM) at the sample
position. The MAR165 charge-coupled device (CCD) detector (Rayonix) was
used to collect diffraction patterns. Powdered LaB₆ was used to
calibrate the distance and tilting of the detector.

For the diffraction measurements, high pressure was achieved in Mao-type
symmetric DACs with c-BN seats to allow access to high diffraction
angles. Two experimental runs were performed on CsEuFe₄As₄. In the first
run, a pair of diamond anvils with a 600 μm cutlet were used up to 11.1
GPa. A Re gasket was pre-indented from 250 μm initial thickness to 85
μm. During the second run, a pair of 500 μm diamond anvils with Re
gasket thickness of 80 μm were used to achieve pressures up to 28.1 GPa.
A single experimental run was performed on the RbEuFe₄As₄ sample, using
diamond anvils of 500 μm cublets up to 29.7 GPa. The Re gasket was
pre-indented to 78 μm and a hole of 260 μm was EDM drilled. All XRD
experiments were carried out at room temperature. The pressure is
cross-checked with solid Ne diffraction peaks above 5 GPa using the
equation of state from Ref. [21]. A gas membrane pressure controller was
used to adjust the pressure. In all the experiments, Ne was used as the
pressure medium. The typical exposure time was 60 seconds per image. The
2-D diffraction images were integrated using the DIOPTAS software [22].
LeBail refinements on the high pressure XRD data were performed in
GSAS-II [23].

High-pressure dc magnetization measurements were performed in a Quantum
Design MPMS using a miniaturized Tozer-type turnbuckle DAC [24, 25]. The
diamonds had culets of 1 mm. A Berylco25 gasket was pre-indented from
250 to 100 μm. The pressure medium was 1:1 n-pentane:isoamyl alcohol,
which is known to be nearly hydrostatic to 7.4 GPa at room temperature
[26]. The ruby manometer signal was collected via fiber optic access
through a custom sample rod. Pressure was applied at room temperature
for these measurements.

The ac magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed using a
balanced primary/secondary coil system that has been described elsewhere
[27]. The diamond anvil cell is an Almax-Easylab "Chicago DAC" [28],
which is designed to fit inside the bore of a Quantum Design PPMS.
Samples with approximate dimensions of 200 μm × 200 μm × 50 μm were
extracted from a larger chunk of polycrystalline material and loaded
into the sample chamber. The diamonds had culets of 800 μm and a
Berylco25 gasket was indented from 250 to 80 μm. Daphne oil was used as
a pressure medium. Two SR830 lock-in amplifiers are used in order to
simultaneously measure the first and third harmonic of the ac magnetic
susceptibility [29]. The primary provides an excitation field of 3 Oe
rms at 1023 Hz. The detection coil is connected through a Stanford
Research SR554 transformer/preamplifier. For these measurements, the
signal is dominated by a large, temperature-dependent background signal
deriving from the gasket and nearby parts of the DAC. In order to
eliminate this contribution, we have measured the temperature-dependent
background susceptibility and subtracted it from the data. The ruby
manometer signal was collected via optical fiber and a lens system which
is mounted to the diamond anvil cell. Pressure changes were carried out
at room temperature.

For the resistivity measurements, small sample pieces with dimensions of
about 70 μm × 70 μm × 10 μm were cut from a larger piece of polycrystal
for each of the measurements. The measurements were carried out in a
OmniDAC gas-membrane-driven diamond anvil cell from Almax-Easylab. The
cell was placed inside a custom, continuous-flow cryostat built by
Oxford Instruments. Optical access to the cell for visual observation
and measurement of the ruby manometer is provided through windows at the
bottom of the cryostat and an optical fiber entering via a feed-through
at the top. One of the diamonds used was a designer-diamond anvil
containing eight symmetrically arranged, deposited-tungsten microprobes
encapsulated in high-quality-homoepitaxial diamond [30]. This diamond
had a culet diameter of ∼ 180 μm, and the opposing anvil had a culet
diameter of ∼ 500 μm. Resistance was measured in the van der Pauw
geometry with currents of ∼ 1 mA. Gaskets were pre-indented from 150 μm
to ∼ 30 μm thickness and were made of 316 stainless steel.
Quasihydrostatic soft, solid steatite was used as the
pressure-transmitting medium. The temperature at which pressure was
applied varied in different experimental runs as specified in the text
and figures.

## III Crystal structure

Representative XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 1. At ∼ 5 GPa additional
peaks from the solid No pressure medium (marked by asterisks) appear in
the diffraction pattern. The lattice parameters a and c obtained from
LeBail refinements with space group P4/mmm are shown in Fig. 2. Both a
and c decrease smoothly with pressure up to 12 GPa (CsEuFe₄As₄) and 10
GPa (RbEuFe₄As₄). The volume as a function of pressure in the low
pressure structure for both compounds is fitted with the third-order
Birch-Murnaghan equation [31]. For CsEuFe₄As₄, we find B₀ = 46.3(2) GPa
and B₀^(′) = 5.59(6). For RbEuFe₄As₄, we find B₀ = 50.7(7) GPa and
B₀^(′) = 4.1(3). Due to the absorption of the c-BN seat and spotty
nature of the data, Rietveld refinement was not successful.

With further increase of pressure, anomalous compression is evidenced by
the negative compressibility of a and a gradual collapse of the c
lattice constant evidenced by a change in the slope of c vs P. These
features are also visible in the c/a ratio plotted in the lower panels
of Fig. 2. Such tetragonal to collapsed-tetragonal structural
transitions are common in 122 compounds [32, 33, 34, 35]. Similar
anomalous compression has been observed in CaKFe₄As₄ near 4 GPa [36] and
in the 122 analog EuFe₂As₂ around 8-12 GPa [34, 37]. The relatively
small changes in the lattice parameters at the structural transition for
CaKFe₄As₄, combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations,
led the authors of Ref. [36] to propose that the transition is to a
"half-collapsed" tetragonal phase. In this phase, As-As bonds form
across the Ca layer, but not across the K layer. At still higher
pressures, one might thus expect another collapse transition as As-As
bonds form across the K layer. In the present results on RbEuFe₄As₄ and
CsEuFe₄As₄ we find changes in the a and c lattice constants that are
consistent with the half-collapse scenario since they are comparable to
those found for CaKFe₄As₄ and substantially smaller than those found for
KFe₂As₂[38] and CaFe₂As₂[32].

In the case of the RbEuFe₄As₄ data, we see two anomalies in the lattice
constant vs pressure data. This is most clearly visible in the a vs P
data, where a begins to increase at ∼10 GPa, passes through a maximum,
and then again begins to increase with pressure near 20 GPa. These two
features may be connected with a sequence of transitions from tetragonal
(T) to half-collapsed (hcT) starting at 10 GPa, followed by a transition
from hcT to fully collapsed tetragonal (cT) starting at 20 GPa. In the
case of CsEuFe₄As₄, the data suggest that the transition to the hcT
phase begins at 12 GPa, while an eventual cT phase likely appears at a
pressure somewhere above 30 GPa.

## IV Magnetic measurements

Figure 3 presents the results of dc magnetization measurements on
RbEuFe₄As₄ at several values of the applied pressure. The data were
collected with an applied field of 10 Oe. The zero field cooled (ZFC)
and field cooled (FC) measurements are plotted in separate panels and
the data have been offset for clarity. The measurement marked 0.0 GPa
was collected with the sample loaded inside the pressure cell sample
chamber. At zero pressure, both the superconducting transition
(T_(c) ∼ 36 K) and the magnetic transition (T_(m) ∼ 15 K) are clearly
visible. The data have been plotted using the estimated volume of the
sample such that a full Meissner effect would generate a change in the
signal of −1. The measurements indicate a shielding fraction of  ∼ 45%,
which is consistent with the relatively large size of the ferromagnetic
anomaly compared to the superconducting drop. We note that the exact
volume of the tiny, irregularly shaped sample is difficult to estimate
precisely and the error in this calibration could be as large as  ∼ 50%.
The substantially smaller magnitude of the diamagnetic drop in χ for the
FC measurements compared to the ZFC measurements is likely due to
pinning.

As pressure increases, the magnetic transition moves to higher
temperature and the diamagnetic signal at T_(c) moves to

lower temperature and becomes smaller. Somewhere between 4.0 and 4.7 GPa
clear signatures of the superconducting transition vanish. Extrapolation
of the two transition temperatures suggests that they do not meet until
 ∼ 7 GPa. The disappearance of the superconducting signal at a somewhat
lower pressure might be due to substantial flux pinning on cooling
through the superconducting transition when T_(m) is just below T_(c).
Alternatively, inhomogeneity or strain in the sample could cause the
magnetism to weaken or destroy superconductivity in certain regions of
the sample.

Figure 4 shows a comparison of the real parts of the first (χ^(′)) and
third harmonic (χ₃^(′)) of the ac susceptibility for CsEuFe₄As₄. Results
are shown for both a large piece of sample at ambient pressure and for a
small piece of sample loaded in the diamond cell at the lowest applied
pressure, 0.5 GPa. The data have been plotted in units such that
4πχ = −1 corresponds to full shielding, by using estimates of the sample
volume. Both the ambient pressure sample and the sample loaded in the
diamond cell show diamagnetic signals that are consistent with full
shielding.

While the interpretation of χ^(′) is simple, the interpretation of
χ₃^(′) is less straightforward. It is known that the shape of the χ₃^(′)
transition can have a complicated dependence on measurement conditions.
Analysis of the frequency dependence of χ₃^(′) can provide insight into
the flux dynamics of the material [39, 40]. From a practical standpoint,
χ₃^(′) provides a complementary way to track the transition temperatures
as a function of pressure. Figure 4 demonstrates that the
superconducting onset temperature in χ^(′) occurs at approximately the
same temperature as the onset in χ₃^(′). In addition, the minimum in
χ₃^(′) just below 30 K is in good agreement with the midpoint of the
superconducting transition measured via χ^(′). As we will see later, the
minimum in χ₃^(′) also corresponds very closely with the midpoint of the
resistive transition. Though the feature at T_(m) is visible in the high
pressure data, it is substantially smaller in relative magnitude than
the corresponding feature in the large, ambient pressure sample.

Having established the approximate shielding fraction and relationship
between first and third harmonic signals, we now turn to the
high-pressure ac susceptibility results. Figure 5 shows a selection of
ac magnetic susceptibility measurements for CsEuFe₄As₄. The trends are
very similar to those observed in the dc measurements on RbEuFe₄As₄,
though the measurements extend to higher pressures. Increasing pressure
causes an increase in T_(m) and a decrease in T_(c). When the
superconducting and magnetic transition are very close in temperature
(5.9 GPa and 6.9 GPa) it becomes difficult to distinguish the location
of T_(c). However at higher pressure (8.9 GPa) there appears to be a
diamagnetic superconducting signal just below 20 K, which is lower than
T_(m) ∼ 28 K.

temperature for a large piece of CsEuFe₄As₄ at ambient pressure (left)
and a small piece inside the diamond anvil cell (right). The vertical
dashed lines are guides to the eye showing the correspondence between
features in the first and third harmonic. The minimum in χ₃^(′) occurs
near the midpoint of the superconducting transition in χ^(′).

superconducting transition is visible as a drop in the signal and the
magnetic transition corresponds to the peak. (b) Real part of the third
harmonic (χ₃^(′)).

temperature for several different pressures. The left and right show the
zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) data. The data have been
offset for clarity.

This suggests that a significant fraction of the sample remains
superconducting when T_(m) > T_(c). However, the proximity of T_(m) and
T_(c), together with the broadness of the superconducting transitions,
makes it impossible to obtain an unambiguous estimate of the
superconducting volume fraction at the higher pressures. Nonetheless, by
12 GPa, which is above the structural transition, there is clearly no
trace of a superconducting transition–though the signal at T_(m)
remains.

Figure 5(b) shows the corresponding measurements of χ₃^(′), which were
measured simultaneously with the first harmonic at each pressure. An
onset in the χ₃^(′) signal is still visible up to 8.9 GPa, but is
suppressed to below 5 K by 12 GPa. The minimum in χ₃^(′), which
corresponds approximately to the midpoint of the superconducting
transition, can be tracked to 5.9 GPa. Both onset and midpoint indicate
a monotonic suppression of T_(c) with pressure.

## V. Electrical resistivity measurements

Figure 6 shows resistivity versus temperature curves for CsEuFe₄As₄ and
RbEuFe₄As₄ at selected pressures spanning the entire pressure range
studied. In order to present the data clearly and avoid excessive
overlapping of the curves, we have plotted the data corresponding to
superconducting transitions in the upper panel and those corresponding
to magnetic transitions in the lower panel. At ambient pressure, samples
of both materials exhibit complete drops to zero resistance [dashed
curves in panels (a) and (c) of Fig. 6]. However, under pressure, the
resistivity does not drop completely to zero for either compound. At the
lowest temperatures, roughly 20

Figure 6: Resistivity as a function of temperature at various pressures
for CsEuFe₄As₄ [panels (a) and (b)] and RbEuFe₄As₄ [panels (c) and (d)].
The dashed curves indicate data taken at ambient pressure that have been
normalized to facilitate comparison with the high pressure data. For
clarity, the curves corresponding to superconducting transitions are
plotted in the top panels and those corresponding to magnetic
transitions are plotted in the bottom panels. The superconducting
transition is suppressed by pressure, while the magnetic transition is
enhanced.

Figure 7: Derivative of the resistivity as a function of temperature for
several different pressures while unloading in the regime where
T_(m) > T_(c). Data for two different pressure runs are shown for both
CsEuFe₄As₄ (left) and RbEuFe₄As₄ (right).

Despite the issues described above, the resistivity data show clear
trends that allow us to track both T_(c) and T_(m) as a function of
pressure. For both compounds T_(c) decreases smoothly with pressure. The
drop in the resistance above T_(c) becomes smaller at higher pressures
and eventually vanishes. Once the signatures of superconductivity
vanish, another weaker anomaly appears in the resistivity. This feature
moves to higher temperature and becomes more pronounced with increasing
pressure. At lower pressures in particular, the weaker anomaly is
difficult to see in the raw resistivity data [Figs. 6(b), 6(d)], but is
clearly visible in the derivative of this data. Derivative (dρ/dT) data
are presented for several different experimental runs in Fig. 7. The
high pressure anomaly in the resistivity is clearly due to the magnetic
ordering transition, since it shows the same pressure dependence as
T_(m) (see Fig. 8).

## VI Phase diagrams

Combining the data from six different pressure runs, consisting of
magnetic or resistivity measurements at more than 90 different
pressures, together with the room-temperature x-ray diffraction data, we
arrive at the phase diagrams presented in Fig. 8. The dashed vertical
lines indicate the critical pressures for the onset of the structural
transitions, which have been determined at room temperature from the
pressure at which the a lattice constant begins to increase. While it is
possible that these transition pressures have some temperature
dependence, in the case of CaKFe₄As₄, it was found that the T → hcT
transition pressure was not strongly dependent on temperature [36]. Both
CsEuFe₄As₄ and RbEuFe₄As₄ exhibit quite similar phase diagrams. The
similarity in the phase diagrams for both compounds is not surprising
given that, at P = 0, the values of T_(m), T_(c), and the
compressibility of the two compounds are nearly identical.

Under pressure, T_(m) increases to a maximum value near  ∼ 40-50 K at
 ∼ 25-30 GPa. The initial (P ∼ 0) values of the slope dT_(m)/dP are
 ∼ 1.7 K/GPa for RbEuFe₄As₄ and  ∼ 1.5 K/GPa for CsEuFe₄As₄. We do not
detect any significant anomaly or change in slope of the T_(m) vs
pressure curve at the onset of the T → hcT transition. With increasing
pressure, T_(c) is suppressed monotonically. Assembling data from
multiple measurements suggests that the onset of the superconducting
transition falls below T_(m) at P_(c) ∼ 7 GPa for both compounds. In the
case of the Cs compound, we have evidence from a single temperature
sweep that a substantial fraction of the sample remains superconducting
when T_(c) > T_(m) (see χ^(′) and χ₃^(′) data for 8.9 GPa in Fig. 5).

The criteria for the superconducting onset temperature are given by the
intersection of linear fits to the data just above and just below the
onset of the transition. Magnetic ordering temperatures, T_(m), are
determined using the peak in χ (Figs. 3 and 5), or the the midpoint of
the feature in dρ/dT (Fig. 7). The open symbols in the phase diagrams
correspond to the midpoint of the superconducting transition. The
midpoint values are estimated by taking either the temperature where the
resistivity has dropped to 50

For some of the measurements, the sample was annealed at room
temperature at high pressure, while for other measurements pressure
application occurred at low temperature and the sample was maintained at
 ∼ 60-70 K throughout the course

Figure 8: Superconducting and magnetic phase diagram of CsEuFe₄As₄
(left) and RbEuFe₄As₄ (right). The open symbols correspond to the
midpoints of the superconducting transition, as described in the text.
Superconducting transition temperatures (solid circles) correspond to
the onset of the transition measured via resistivity or magnetic
susceptibility. Magnetic transition temperatures (solid triangles) are
determined from the peak in magnetic susceptibility or midpoint of the
feature in dρ/dT. The dashed, vertical lines indicate onset pressures
for the structural transitions.

of the experiment (see key to Fig. 8). For the superconducting
transition, the data are in good agreement for both types of pressure
application. The data may suggest that samples compressed at low
temperatures tend to present the magnetic transition at a lower
temperature than samples subjected to high pressure at room temperature.
This can be seen by comparing the black and red triangles in the high
pressure part of the phase diagram. The effect is most pronounced for
the RbEuFe₄As₄ sample, though a small effect with the same trend appears
to exist in the CsEuFe₄As₄ data as well. One possibility is that T_(m)
is sensitive to the hydrostaticity of the pressure conditions. Annealing
the sample at room temperature under pressure may tend to relieve strain
in the sample. The phase diagrams of several 122-type iron-based
superconductors are well known to be sensitive to the degree of
hydrostaticity [44, 45]. Another possibility is that kinetic effects due
to low temperature compression alter the pressures ranges for which
different crystal structures are present in the sample [42, 46]. There
are not yet low-temperature/high-pressure x-ray diffraction studies on
AEuFe₄As₄ compounds to test whether this might be the case.

## VII Discussion

Among 1144 materials, to date, only CaKFe₄As₄ appears to have been the
subject of a study under applied pressure [36]. For CaKFe₄As₄, pressure
causes a similar decrease in critical temperature with pressure, though
at a slightly higher rate than we find for RbEuFe₄As₄ and CsEuFe₄As₄. At
4 GPa the structure collapses to an hC phase, and bulk superconductivity
vanishes (though traces of filamentary superconductivity remain) [36].
The disappearance of bulk superconductivity upon the development of
As-As (or P-P) bonding in the collapsed phase appears to be a common
feature of several 122 materials [47, 48, 49]. For (Rb,Cs)EuFe₄As₄, an
important question is whether bulk superconductivity begins to vanish at
the onset of the structural transition or, perhaps, at P_(c), where
T_(c) dips below T_(m). The former possibility seems probable since we
see substantial signatures of superconductivity in the susceptibility
for CsEuFe₄As₄ at pressures above P_(c). In the case of RbEuFe₄As₄,
partial superconducting transitions extend to pressures above the
critical pressure for the T → hcT transition (right panel of Fig. 8).
This may be due to to pressure gradients associated with the steatite
pressure medium, and the most likely scenario is that the hcT phase is
not a bulk superconductor.

Another interesting question is whether the initial T → hcT transition
corresponds to As-As bonds developing across the Eu layer or,
alternatively, across the Rb/Cs layer. Analysis of our x-ray data has
not allowed us to unambiguously choose between these possibilities.
Comparison with the behavior of other 122 compounds at high pressure
[43, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55] gives some insight. Several Eu-based 122
compounds are known to exhibit pressure-induced T → cT transitions that
are connected to a valence change from Eu²⁺ to nonmagnetic Eu³⁺[34, 50,
56]. For comparison with CsEuFe₄As₄ and RbEuFe₄As₄, we first look to
EuFe₂As₂.

At ambient pressure, EuFe₂As₂ exhibits antiferromagnetic order
(T_(N) ∼ 20 K) deriving from Eu²⁺ ions. EuFe₂As₂ exhibits pressure
induced superconductivity (coexisting with antiferromagnetic order) over
a narrow range of pressures near 2 GPa [57]. Under pressure T_(N)
eventually begins to increase and then transforms to ferromagnetism at
 ∼ 6 GPa [52]. A T → cT transition commences at  ∼ 10 GPa (at low
temperature) [37]. At roughly the same pressure, the ferromagnetic
ordering temperature passes through a maximum and begins to decrease.
The magnetic order and moment of the Eu ion appear to be completely
suppressed by 20 GPa [52]. These observations are consistent with a
valence transition from Eu²⁺ to nonmagnetic Eu³⁺ that commences near the
structural transition, but is not complete until significantly higher
pressures. Examination of the phase diagrams in Fig. 8 shows that the
pressure dependence of the magnetic ordering temperature does not
exhibit any clear anomaly at the onset of the T → hcT transitions. On
the other hand, it does appear that T_(m) begins to saturate within the
hcT phases. Therefore, from our T_(m) versus P data alone, it is not
possible to categorically select which layer (Eu or alkali metal)
initially collapses. However, as discussed below, consideration of
structural trends in iron-based 122 compounds strongly suggests that the
initial collapse occurs in the Eu layer.

Yu _et al._[37] examined the critical pressure for the T → cT transition
pressure in AFe₂As₂ compounds (A= Ca, Sr, Ba, and Eu). They noted that
the critical pressure showed a trend of increasing with increasing
cation radius. This trend is consistent with the findings of DFT
calculations on CaKFe₄As₄[36], which indicate that the Ca layer
collapses first (r_(Ca³⁺) = 1.0 A) while the K layer only collapses at
higher pressures (r_(K⁺) = 1.4 A) [58]. The ionic radius of Eu²⁺ (1.2 A)
is smaller than that of both Rb⁺ (1.5 A) and Cs⁺ (1.7 A) [58].
Consequently, in CsEuFe₄As₄ and RbEuFe₄As₄, the collapse of the Eu layer
should occur first, with the alkali metal layer collapsing at higher
pressure. This picture is also consistent with our observation that the
sample containing the smaller Rb⁺ ion exhibits a second collapse
transition beginning at  ∼ 20 GPa, while for the sample containing the
larger Cs⁺ ion, the second collapse does not occur below 30 GPa.
Comparison with the trend of the T → cT pressure versus ionic radius
presented in Ref. [37] suggests that the Cs layer in CsEuFe₄As₄ should
collapse at a pressure of  ∼ 30 GPa, which is just at the limit of the
range of our measurements. The transition sequence described above is
consistent with the results of recent DFT calculations [59].

## VIII Conclusion

In summary, we find that both RbEuFe₄As₄ and CsEuFe₄As₄ exhibit very
similar phase diagrams under pressure. X-ray diffraction measurements
suggest a transition to a half-collapsed tetragonal phase at pressures
of 10 GPa and 12 GPa for RbEuFe₄As₄ and CsEuFe₄As₄, respectively. For
RbEuFe₄As₄, an additional structural transition to a fully collapsed
tetragonal phase may occur at 20 GPa. For both materials, the magnetic
transition temperature, T_(m), increases with pressure while the
superconducting transition temperature T_(c) decreases. The two
transitions coincide near a critical pressure P_(c) ∼ 7 GPa, indicating
that a crossover from FMS to SFM occurs prior to the onset of the
tetragonal → half-collapsed-tetragonal transition. The relatively modest
pressures required to tune this crossover make AEuFe₄As₄ compounds a
very interesting system for further exploring the interplay of
superconductivity and (local moment) magnetism in a clean,
stoichiometric material.

The present measurements have been performed using polycrystalline
samples which show somewhat broad transitions. Recently,
single-crystalline specimens [60] have been grown which show
substantially sharper transitions. It would be particularly interesting
to further examine the narrow pressure range around P_(c) in such
crystals in order to explore, e.g., the influence of the FMS to SFM
crossover on the upper critical field curve.
