###### Abstract

The interplay and coexistence of superconducting, magnetic, and
structural order parameters in NaFe_(1 − x)Co_(x)As have been studied
using superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry, muon
spin rotation, and synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction. Substituting Fe
by Co weakens the ordered magnetic state through both a suppression of
$T_{\rm N}$ and a reduction in the size of the ordered moment. Upon
further substitution of Fe by Co the high sensitivity of the muon as a
local magnetic probe reveals a magnetically disordered phase, in which
the size of the moment continues to decrease and falls to zero around
the same point at which the magnetically driven structural distortion is
no longer resolvable. Both magnetism and the structural distortion are
weakened as the robust superconducting state is established.

## 1 Introduction

The phase diagrams of iron-based superconductors demonstrate that, as
for the cuprates, the superconducting state generally emerges from a
magnetic parent compound under chemical substitution.[1, 2, 3] However,
in contrast to the cuprates, where the magnetic state is due to
electrons localized in a Mott insulator, in iron-based superconductors
it arises from an instability of the delocalized Fe d-band electrons.[4]
It is important to understand how this magnetic state evolves into the
superconducting one and how the two states compete, coexist, or mutually
exclude one another.

In this paper we study the "111" arsenide compound NaFe_(1 − x)Co_(x)As
using superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry,
muon spin rotation (μSR), and synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction
(XRPD) experiments. Our results allow us to follow in detail how the
magnetic state collapses as Fe is substituted by Co, first by weakening
the magnetic long-range order (LRO) and structural distortion and then
by suppressing magnetic fluctuations. Our data demonstrate the decisive
influence of the magnetism on the system and show how its disappearance
correlates with the strengthening of the superconducting phase. A
summary of our findings is shown in the phase diagram in Fig. 1 (which
includes some data points from Ref. [5]). It is notable that, in
comparison with other pnictides, very small amounts of Co on the Fe site
result in a complete suppression of the magnetic state. For example, the
optimal $T_{\rm c}$ is obtained with a substitution of ∼1.5

For this study, a series of NaFe_(1 − x)Co_(x)As compounds were
synthesized according to the methods described in Ref. [5], and details
of structural characterization and purity checks can be found there.

## 2 Squid magnetometry

Magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out on a Quantum
Design MPMS-XL SQUID magnetometer under zero-field (ZF) cooled and field
cooled conditions in a measuring field of 5 mT. The evolution of
zero-field susceptibility with temperature for a representative set of
samples is shown in Fig. 2 (a more complete data set can be found in
Ref. [5], and the superconducting $T_{\rm c}$ values for all studied
samples are indicated in Fig. 1). Also shown is the evolution of the
estimated superconducting volume fraction with doping [Fig. 2 (inset),
shown also by the shading of the superconducting phase in Fig. 1], which
suggests that samples with x > 0.0125 are fully superconducting. No
traces of magnetic impurities, such as Fe, were identified by these
measurements in any of our samples.

## 3 Zero-field μSr

To probe the magnetic order parameter in NaFe_(1 − x)Co_(x)As, ZF μSR
measurements were made on samples with 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.02 using the General
Purpose Surface-Muon Instrument spectrometer at the Swiss Muon Source
and the MuSR spectrometer at the ISIS facility. Figure 3 shows example
spectra measured at T = 1.5 K. For small x, we observe oscillations in
the time dependence of the muon spin polarization (via the positron
decay asymmetry), which are strongly indicative of magnetic long-range
order. These become less distinct with increasing x and are not
discernible for x > 0.0125. The frequencies of the oscillations are
proportional to the local magnetic field at the muon site(s) and scale
with the ordered moment, so any one of them may be considered an
effective magnetic order parameter for the system.

To extract the order parameter as a function of temperature and locate
$T_{\rm N}$, the oscillating asymmetry functions for the materials with
x ≤ 0.0125 were fitted to the expression
$A(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}A_{i}\cos(2\pi\,v_{i}t)\exp(-\lambda_{i}t)$, with
the frequencies held in fixed proportion. For all samples, except
stoichiometric NaFeAs, it was found that two frequencies were required
to fit the data (i.e., n = 2), with one around 20 times larger than the
other. In the undoped compound the addition of a third component, with a
frequency very similar in value to the other low-frequency component,
slightly improved the fit.[5] As the damping rates, λ_(i), of all
oscillations increase with x, suggesting a rising level of magnetic
disorder, we suggest that the third frequency is not resolvable in the
doped compounds. For all samples with 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.0125, it was found that
the amplitude of the high-frequency component, A₁, made up between 55
and 65

For the remaining samples (0.015 ≤ x ≤ 0.02) a fast relaxing component
is observed at early times that disappears as x increases. These data
are best fitted to a relaxation function
$A(t)=A_{\rm slow}\exp(-\sigma^{2}t^{2})+A_{\rm fast}\exp(-\lambda_{i}t)$,
which combines a slowly relaxing Gaussian function, attributable to the
magnetism of static and disordered moments probably of nuclear origin (a
Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe function with the same magnetic-field distribution
fits just as well in this regime), added to a fast exponential
relaxation. This fast relaxing component is most likely attributable to
magnetic fluctuations of electron spins which quickly dephase muons. The
fact that these two contributions are summed suggests that only a
fraction of the muons are dephased by the electronic fluctuations. This
implies that, for x > 0.0125, samples show some degree of inhomogeneous
magnetism (IM). For the materials in this region we observed a decrease
in the relative amplitude of the fast component, $A_{\rm fast}$,
indicating that the extent of the magnetically fluctuating regions
decreases as

x increases. Our muon data show no sign of signals from the most common
impurities in iron arsenide compounds.[10]

The low values of the ZF muon precession frequencies in NaFeAs, compared
to those seen in other iron-based superconductors (see Table 1),
indicate that the moment is correspondingly low. Neutron-scattering
measurements indeed indicate a low moment, 0.09(4) $\mu_{\rm B}$, on the
Fe site in pure[11] NaFeAs. Our ZF μSR data can be used to make an
independent estimate of this moment, along with its variation with x. We
can obtain the probability $P(\mu_{\rm Fe}[\{v_{i}\}]$ [shown in the
inset of Fig. 4(a)], that is the probability of $\mu_{\rm Fe}$ taking a
particular value given that we observe a set of precession frequencies,
{v_(i)}, using Bayes’s theorem to invert the probability of observing a
set of precession frequencies given a particular Fe moment (which is
easily calculable from dipole-field simulations). This method (see Refs.
[12; 13]) allows us to provide a quantitative estimate of
$\mu_{\rm Fe}=0.10(3)\mu_{\rm B}$, assuming the magnetic structure to be
as determined in Ref. [11], ignoring any hyperfine coupling and
constraining the muon location to be at least 1 A from an atom site.
This estimate is in good agreement with the value from neutron
scattering.[11] The dependence of v₁(0) as a function of $T_{\rm N}$ is
shown by the solid circles in Fig. 4(a), and hence the dependence of
$\mu_{\rm Fe}$ as a function of x is shown in Fig. 4(b). It is
noticeable that v₁(0) (and hence $\mu_{\rm Fe}$) tends to zero more
quickly than $T_{\rm N}$. This suggests it is the collapse of the moment
that destroys the magnetic state.

## IV X-ray powder diffraction

To probe the structural distortion in NaFe_(1 − x)Co_(x)As we performed
XRPD studies of samples with 0 < x < 0.025 on the ID31 beamline at the
European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). In Ref. [5] the
distortion was characterized as a transition from a high-temperature
tetragonal (P4/nmm) phase to a low-temperature orthorhombic (Cmma)
phase, with $d_{\rm orth}=\sqrt{2}a_{\rm tet}$. In order to analyze the
variation in the size of this distortion with temperature and doping, we
fitted data at all temperatures to a Cmma phase. In the TOPAS Academic
software,[15] the lattice parameters were defined as
$a=\sqrt{2}a_{\rm tet}+\delta/2$ and $b=\sqrt{2}a_{\rm tet}-\delta/2$,
with both $a_{\rm tet}$ and δ allowed to vary. The data were then fitted
to this model using a structure-independent Pawley refinement,[14] and a
typical refinement is shown in Fig. 5. At high temperatures and/or
dopings, where δ was sufficiently low as to only cause peaks to broaden
rather than split, a set of refinements with δ fixed at zero (i.e.,
using a tetragonal model) was carried out. Comparing the statistics of
the two models allowed us to confirm the temperatures at which the
structural distortion was no longer resolvable. Plots of δ versus T for
all samples with a resolvable distortion are shown in Fig. 6(a). These
data sets have been fitted to the function
$\delta=[1-(T/T_{\rm s})^{\alpha}]^{\beta}$ to locate $T_{\rm s}$, with
α allowed to vary and β fixed around the mean-field value of 1/2.

Combining $T_{\rm N}$ from μSR, $T_{\rm s}$ from XRPD and measurements
of superconducting $T_{\rm c}$, and the volume fraction from SQUID
magnetometry allows us to produce the phase diagram in Fig. 1, showing
that the superconductivity, magnetism, and structural distortion coexist
for x ≤ 0.0125, with the superconducting volume fraction increasing with
increasing x. The results of our ZF μSR experiments indicate that the
magnetism weakens as x is increased, with the system unable to sustain
magnetic LRO for x > 0.0125. However, IM and the structural distortion
coexist with bulk superconductivity in the region 0.015 ≤ x ≤ 0.020.

Further insight into the effect of the reduction in the strength of the
magnetism may be obtained by comparing the magnetic and structural order
parameters, v₁(T) and δ(T), respectively, as shown in Fig. 6. A
reduction in both v₁(0) and δ(0) is apparent as x is increased, along
with a marked suppression of these order parameters with decreasing T in
the more highly doped samples (indicated by arrows in Fig. 6). The
suppression of the structural distortion is evident in Fig. 5 (inset).

orthorhombic 022 and 202 reflections (into which the tetragonal 122 peak
splits) falls on cooling from 10 to

be the temperature at which this contribution sets in (see Fig. 7).

that Δ, the splitting in the 2θ values of the two peaks, is smaller at 5
than at 10 K, suggesting a suppression of the structural distortion at
low temperatures. This is in agreement with the behavior of δ(T) as
obtained from fitting the full pattern.

5 K (having increased on cooling from $T_{\rm s}$ to 10 K). We note that
the suppression of both δ and v at low T is observed in those samples
with a full superconducting volume fraction, in agreement with what is
seen in other pnictide families.[3, 16]

## V Transverse field μSr

To further probe the region above x = 0.015 we have used transverse
field μSR, which also provides a method of probing the superconducting
state of type-II superconductors.[17] A magnetic field is applied
perpendicular to the initial muon spin direction, which also produces a
vortex lattice in the material’s superconducting phase. This results in
a distribution in the local field across the sample, whose rms width
$B_{\rm rms}$ can be extracted from the muon precession. Contributions
to $B_{\rm rms}$ arise from superconductivity, static electronic
magnetism, and nuclear moments (the latter being small and temperature
independent) and add in quadrature. The measured temperature dependence
of $B_{\rm rms}$ is plotted in Fig. 7, and for each sample studied we
find that $B_{\rm rms}$ rises sharply on cooling through the
superconducting $T_{\rm c}$ (found independently from SQUID
magnetometry), consistent with a contribution to the broadening from the
vortex lattice. In addition, we observe a contribution to $B_{\rm rms}$
from magnetism which decreases steadily as x increases from 0.015. For
x = 0.025 the magnetic contribution is negligible and the temperature
dependence of $B_{\rm rms}$ is consistent with that expected for
conventional superconducting order [solid line in Fig. 7(d)]. It is
likely that in the materials for 0.015 ≤ x < 0.025 the IM is associated
with a nonzero moment on the Fe site, but the moment is insufficient to
stabilize a fully ordered magnetic state. We then associate the increase
of $B_{\rm rms}$ just above the superconducting $T_{\rm c}$ with the
onset of the IM state. We also observe a peak in $B_{\rm rms}$ at around
17 K (most noticeable in the sample with x = 0.015 but weakened and
broadened for higher x) which may be due to increased correlation
between the static moments (but which stops short of LRO, as we do not
observe a precession signal in ZF μSR). This peak is also observed in
the ZF amplitude of the fast relaxing component for the x = 0.015 sample
[Fig. 7(a)], lending further weight to this interpretation.

We can extract an estimate of the magnetic contribution to $B_{\rm rms}$
in the IM regime by assuming that a magnetic contribution and a
nonmagnetic contribution (the latter assumed to be that of the x = 0.025
sample) add in quadrature. This rms field width can then be used to
provide an estimate of the precession frequency
$[(\gamma_{\mu}/2\pi)\,B_{\rm rms}]$ that would have been observed if
the moments in the IM state ordered, and we plot these as open circles
in Fig. 4(a). By assuming the same scaling between frequency and
$\mu_{\rm Fe}$ as for the AF-ordered region, we can use these values to
estimate $\mu_{\rm Fe}$, which is plotted in Fig. 4(b) using open
circles. These data show that as x increases the moment on the Fe site
undergoes a process of steady suppression, initially resulting in a loss
of AF order as the order loses long-range coherence but then collapsing
further in the IM state.

magnetic order parameters with T and x. δ is defined as the difference
between the a and b lattice parameters in the low-temperature Cmma
phase, and v₁ is the largest observed muon precession frequency in the
zero field. The blue line sections show where the sample superconducts,
and the shade of blue indicates the volume fraction obtained from SQUID
magnetometry. The arrows indicate the suppression of δ and v₁ in the
more highly substituted samples.

$B_{\rm rms}$ matches one observed in the zero-field fast relaxation
amplitude $A_{\rm fast}$. The gray line indicates $T_{\rm c}$ from SQUID
magnetometry (see Fig. 1). The black line in (d) is a fit to a
conventional SC order-parameter temperature dependence.

## VI Discussion

It has recently been suggested that the structural transition in the
iron pnictides is driven by magnetic fluctuations,[18] rather than by
magnetic order. The fluctuations could be of different types:
spin-nematic fluctuations,[18, 19] ferro-orbital fluctuations,[20, 21]
or critical fluctuations.[22, 23] Our discussion will focus on the
spin-nematic model of Ref. [18], which we believe explains the main
features of our data. The theoretical picture is motivated by the
magnetic structure found in these materials, where Fe spins are coupled
antiferromagnetically for Fe-Fe bonds along one diagonal of the two-Fe
tetragonal unit cell and ferromagnetically along the other diagonal.
This results in two coupled antiferromagnetic sublattices with coplanar
staggered magnetization. The sublattice coupling is related to a Z₂
symmetry, which allows two possible orientations of stripes in the
magnetic structure. This symmetry is broken by _nematic order_, which
can be present with zero sublattice magnetization and whose onset may
therefore occur at temperatures above any magnetic ordering temperature.
The result of this nematic order is to bias the magnetic fluctuations
along a particular stripe orientation. Crucially, the nematic order
parameter couples to the lattice, causing bonds between neighboring
(anti)parallel spins to (expand) contract, and this leads to the
observed structural distortion. The prerequisite for nematic order is a
large, but finite, magnetic correlation length, whose occurrence at
elevated temperatures is probable for materials in both the magnetically
ordered and IM region of the phase diagram of NaFe_(1 − x)Co_(x)As.

From this point of view it is magnetic fluctuations, biased by nematic
order, that not only lead to magnetic order but also drive the
structural distortion. Substituting Fe by Co causes a reduction in the
strength of these magnetic fluctuations, and this suppresses both the
magnetic order and the structural distortion. Our measurements show that
on increasing x the structural and magnetic order parameters weaken
until the fluctuations can no longer sustain magnetic order above
x ≳ 0.0125. Further substitution of Fe by Co continues to weaken the
fluctuations, and this coincides with the weakening of the structural
distortion order parameter until fluctuations can no longer sustain the
structural order parameter for x > 0.0225. This weakening of the
magnetic fluctuations is coincident with a strengthening of
superconductivity in NaFe_(1 − x)Co_(x)As. This is also consistent with
the nematic order picture, which predicts a competition between
superconductivity and magnetism. Specifically, the onset of
superconductivity is predicted to lead to a reduction in the static part
of the magnetic susceptibility[18] which weakens the magnetic order and
spin correlations. This is seen in our data, where we observe the low-T
suppression of (i) the magnetic order parameter in the x = 0.0125
material (where long-range magnetic order is only just sustained) and
(ii) the structural order parameter for x > 0.15 (where the structural
order parameter has been weakened). We note that these samples have
close to full superconducting volume fractions and the dip in the order
parameter is only observed for $T\ll T_{\rm c}$, where the
superconducting order parameter has become sufficiently strong.

It is interesting to compare these results with those obtained on
another "111" superconductor, LiFeAs.[24, 25, 26] A result of
accommodating the smaller Li⁺ ion (rather than Na⁺) between the FeAs
layers is that the edge-staring FeAs₄ tetrahedra in LiFeAs are very
compressed in the basal plane. Superconductivity occurs in the
stoichiometric material LiFeAs, in contrast to other iron arsenide
superconductors for which doping away from the formal oxidation state of
Fe²⁺ or the application of hydrostatic pressure is required to induce
superconductivity. Furthermore, stoichiometric LiFeAs does not appear to
show static magnetism[27] (in contrast to NaFeAs). The present study
demonstrates that substituting a small amount of Co on the Fe site
strengthens the superconducting state in NaFeAs, but in LiFeAs
substitution of Fe by small amounts of Co or Ni results in a steady
lowering of the superconducting transition temperature.[28] For LiFeAs,
$T_{\rm c}$ is lowered monotonically at a rate of 10 K per 0.1 electrons
added per formula unit irrespective of whether the dopant is Co or Ni,
and at higher substitution levels superconductivity is completely
suppressed. (Co and Ni have a similar _structural_ effect as a function
of the level of doping, but Ni adds twice as many electrons as Co.) The
number of electrons added per formula unit is also the determinative
quantity for NaFeAs, but here the superconducting state is first
strengthened (as the magnetic state is destroyed) and then weakened (see
Fig. 1).

Finally, the behavior of the superfluid stiffness as a function of
$T_{\rm c}$ in LiFeAs derivatives is markedly different from that of
other pnictides,[29] including the isostructural NaFeAs-derivatives
considered here and the "1111" and "122" classes.[28] Most of the
pnictides exhibit behavior more similar to the hole-doped cuprates, but
LiFeAs derivatives resemble much more closely the electron-doped
cuprates. The differing behavior of LiFeAs may result from the
underlying structural difference introduced by the small Li⁺ ion,
resulting in a band structure which does not favor Fermi-surface
nesting,[30] so that the magnetic instability found in the other
isoelectronic (i.e., undoped) iron arsenides does not compete
successfully against superconductivity in LiFeAs.

## VII Conclusion

In conclusion, we have presented a picture of NaFe_(1 − x)Co_(x)As in
which a magnetic interaction drives both magnetic LRO and a structural
distortion and weakens with the substitution of Fe by Co, causing a
decrease in the size of the ordered magnetic moment. Magnetic LRO
becomes unsustainable above x = 0.0125, but the structural distortion
persists until the moment in the IM state is no longer strong enough to
sustain it. The IM state may be characterized by a long but finite
magnetic correlation length and nematic order, which biases the magnetic
fluctuations along stripes. Competing directly with magnetism is
superconductivity, which, on reaching full volume fraction, weakens the
magnetism dramatically and is seen directly to depress the magnetic and
structural order parameters at low temperature.
