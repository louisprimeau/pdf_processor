###### Abstract

We have studied the transport and structural properties of Pr1-_x_Ca_x Ba2Cu3O7-_b_ thin films grown by pulsed-laser deposition, focusing on Ca substitution levels x >= 0.3 for which the bulk material is metastable. Films with 0.4 <= x <= 0.5 exhibit a superconducting transition due to divalent cation doping on the rare-earth site. Pr0.5Ca0.5Ba2Cu3O7-_b_ epitaxial thin films exhibit a superconducting onset temperature as high as 47 K with _T_c(_R_ = 0) = 35 K. X-ray-diffraction and electrical-transport data suggest that Ca doping levels greater than x = 0.5 are possible, although disorder is introduced as the divalent to trivalent cation ratio becomes large. This work demonstrates that 1:2:3-phase superconductivity can be achieved by substituting Ca for Pr, without the presence in the alloy of Y or any other rare-earth element, R, for which _R_Ba2Cu3O7-_b_ is superconducting. This result supports the view that hole localization, due to hybridization of the Pr 4f electronic levels with the O 2p orbitals, contributes substantially to the suppression of superconductivity by Pr in PrBa2Cu3O7-_b_, and demonstrates that this suppression can be partially compensated by appropriate hole doping with Ca.

## I Introduction

The superconducting properties of the materials R Ba2Cu3O7-_b_ are nearly independent of the rare-earth element R.[1,2] This is surprising as many of the lanthanide elements possess magnetic moments, normally a condition detrimental to superconductivity, and indicates that the CuO2 planes and the rare-earth ions are electronically isolated. The exceptions to this behavior are Ce, Tb, and Pr, which do not form superconductors, with only Pr forming a single-phase "1:2:3" structure. PrBa2Cu3O7-_b_ is a semiconductor,[3, 4, 5] but it is quite similar to the superconducting 1:2:3 compounds in structure and oxygen chemistry, undergoing the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition at values of temperature and oxygen content close to those for YBa2Cu3O7-_b_.[6] However, substitution of Pr on the rare-earth site, R, in R1-_x_ Pr,Ba2Cu3O7-_b_ suppresses _T_c with superconductivity disappearing at x > 0.5.[3, 4, 5]

Much of the discussion concerning the suppression of 1:2:3-phase superconductivity by Pr has centered around its valence. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that the Pr valence is nearly + 4.[5,17] Neutron-diffraction investigations of the separation of the CuO2 planes in PrBa2Cu3O7-_b_ lead to the conclusion that Pr has a mixed valence greater than 3.[18,19] X-ray-absorption spectroscopy studies comparing Pr, Gd and Ho in 1:2:3-phase compounds revealed features attributable to both Pr+3 and Pr+4, again suggesting a mixed-valence system.[20] A formal valence greater than + 3 for Pr in PrBa2Cu3O7-_b_ would explain both the lack of superconductivity and the semiconducting behavior, since Pr could contribute electrons to the CuO2 planes, filling the mobile holes responsible for conduction.[21] However, some resonant valence-band photoemission, x-ray absorption, and structural studies suggest that Pr is trivalent in PrBa2Cu3O7-_b_.[22,23] Obviously, there is some confusion over the valence of Pr in PrBa2Cu3O7-_b_.

Lopez-Morales _et al._ suggest that the value obtained for the valence of Pr in PrBa2Cu3O7-_b_ depends on whether an experiment measures properties associated with the Pr--O bond (that would yield Pr+4) or the charge near the Pr site (that would indicate Pr+3).[6] They consider the formal valence of Pr to be + 3, but with significant hybridization of the Pr 4f states with the CuO2 valence bands leading to mixed-valence character as well.[6, 24, 25, 26] A large body of experimental evidence and band-structure calculations suggest that significant hybridization of the Pr 4f states with the CuO2 valence bands occurs due to the larger radial extent of the Pr ion.[27, 28, 29, 30, 9] Within this model, most, if not all, of the experimental data on PrBa2Cu3O7-_b_ can be interpreted consistently.

Two mechanisms have been proposed for the suppression of _T_c by Pr in the 1:2:3 phase. The first involves superconducting pair breaking by local moments, due to spin-dependent exchange scattering of the holes in the CuO2 planes.[7, 8, 24] The reduction of _T_c with increasing x in Y1-_x_Pr_Ba2Cu3O7-_b_ appears to follow the Abrikosov-Gorkov pair-breaking model. However, the Abrikosov-Gorkov model does not predict the occurrence of a metal-to-insulator transition to accompany this suppression of superconductivity, although this is observed experimentally as x is increased. In addition, other rare-earth elements, such as Gd, possess a much larger spin magnetic moment, with no apparent effect on _T_c. However, hybridization of the Pr 4f electrons with the CuO2 valence band could lead to magnetic pair breaking.[8, 9, 24] The second mechanism for suppression of _T_c by Pr involves the filling and/or localization of holes available for conduction in the CuO2 planes. If the valence of Pr is nearly + 4, the additional electron contributed by  the Pr ion (relative to Y) is expected to fill mobile holes in the CuO2 planes, effectively leaving the holes localized on the Pr, reducing conduction and eliminating superconductivity. This view appears to be too simplistic as recent evidence from electron energy loss and soft- x-ray-absorption spectroscopy suggest that the _total_ hole concentration is unaffected by Pr content in Y1-_x_Pr_x_Ba_Cu_3O7-_d_.[31, 32] An alternative view is that strong hybridization of the Pr 4f with O 2p states leads to localization of the holes without requiring a Pr formal valence greater than +3 or significant changes in the _total_ hole (mobile and trapped) concentration, although the mobile hole concentration does decrease as indicated by Hall,[33, 34] Cu NMR,[35] mid-ir ellipsometric,[36] and muon-spin relaxation measurement.[6, 37, 31] As with magnetic pair breaking, the mechanism for hole localization is intimately related to the strongly hybridized mixed valency of the Pr.[38]

Some rather convincing evidence that Pr produces hole localization that suppresses superconductivity has been presented in studies of the superconducting behavior of Y1-_x_-_y_Ca_p_Pr_x_Ba_Cu_3O7-_d_ alloys.[39-41] The substitution of Ca for Y should add holes to the CuO2 planes. If Pr reduces the _mobile_ hole concentration available for conduction in the CuO2 planes, then the addition of holes by Ca should compensate the effect of Pr in suppressing _T_e. This behavior has indeed been observed. However, the presence of Y in all the samples considered (0 <= x <= 0.2, 0 <= y <= 0.2) somewhat complicates the interpretation of their results because of the possibility that phase separation yields Y-rich regions, which could form a percolative path.[42] Ideally, one would like to investigate hole doping by Ca in the absence of Y or any other element R for which R Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ is superconducting. Previously, we reported that metastable Pr0.5Ca0.5Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ films, which are fully superconducting with _T_e(_R_ = 0)~35 K, can be grown by pulsed-laser deposition.[43] The superconducting transition obviously cannot be the result of phase segregation of a stable superconducting phase as there are no such phases known involving only Pr or Ca. This result supports the view that hole localization is at least partially responsible for the suppression of superconductivity by Pr in 1:2:3-phase compounds.

In this paper, we report on the transport and structural properties of Pr1-_x_Ca_x_Ba_Cu_3O7-_d_ thin films grown by pulsed-laser deposition, focusing on Ca substitution levels x >= 0.3 for which the bulk material is metastable. Films with 0.4 <= x <= 0.5 exhibit a superconducting transition due to divalent cation doping on the rare-earth site. Although superconductivity is induced due to the addition of holes through Ca substitution, x-ray-diffraction data suggest that disorder also is introduced, particularly for x > 0.5. Pr0.5Ca0.5Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ epitaxial thin films exhibit a superconducting onset temperature as high as 47 K, with _T_e(_R_ = 0)= 35 K. Critical current densities as high as 105 A/cm2 at 4.2 K have been measured as well. Apparently, 1:2:3-phase superconductivity can be achieved by substituting Ca for Pr, without the presence of the alloy of Y or any other rare-earth element R for which R Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ is superconducting. This result is consistent with the view that hole localization, due to hybridization of the Pr 4f electronic levels with the O 2p orbitals, contributes substantially to the suppression of superconductivity by Pr in PrBa2Cu3O7-_d_, and demonstrates that this suppression can be partially compensated by appropriate hole doping with Ca.

## II Results and discussion

Pr1-_x_Ca_Ba_Cu_3O7-_d_ epitaxial thin films were grown by pulsed-laser ablation as has been described elsewhere.[44]

Pressed and fired ceramic targets of Pr1-_x_Ca_Ba_Cu_3O7-_d_ were prepared from stoichiometric quantities of high-purity Pr6O11, CaCO3, BaCO3, and CuO in a manner similar to that used to produce superconducting _R_-1:2:3 pellets. Powder x-ray diffraction indicated that the resulting ceramic targets were composed of material with the tetragonal 1:2:3 structure along with a small amount of BaCuO2. (001) SrTiO3 substrates were utilized for most of these experiments, although LaAlO3, MgO, yttria-stabilized zirconia and KTaO3 substrates sometimes were included. Film growth was carried out in an oxygen pressure of 200 mTorr. After deposition, the films were cooled in 400 Torr of oxygen at 10 degC/min. Throughout this paper, the growth temperature refers to the heater temperature as measured by an attached thermocouple. The film composition was assumed to be the same as the target composition which is typically the case for pulsed-laser deposition.

Figure 1(a) shows the resistivity for three thin-film

  samples with Ca contents of x=0.3,0.4,0.5. Resistivity was measured using a standard four-point method with the current density less than 10 A/cm^{2}. As seen in the figure, the resistivity decreases as the Ca concentration increases, consistent with the view that substituting a divalent into a rare-earth site hole dopes the material. A superconducting transition was observed for both the Pr_{0.6}Ca_{0.4}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} [T_{c} (onset)] ~ 25 K, T_{c}(R=0)\sim 10 K] and the Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} [T_{c}(onset) ~ 47 K, T_{c}(R=0)\sim 35 K] samples, with no transition observed for the Pr_{0.7}Ca_{0.3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} film. ac magnetic susceptibility measurements on the Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin films also indicated a superconducting transition. For Pr_{0.4}Ca_{0.6}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin films, no R=0 superconducting state was observed, although the resistivity demonstrated a reentrant behavior, as seen in Fig. 1(b). This reentrant behavior suggests that a small volume fraction of superconducting material with T_{c}(onset) ~ 47 K, is present in the material. Although this behavior is reminiscent of a mixed-phase material, this does not appear to be the case here as no impurity peaks were observed in the x-ray-diffraction pattern for this film. However, significant broadening of the 1:2:3 x-ray-diffraction peaks was evident. In addition, the (00_l_) peaks for the Pr_{0.4}Ca_{0.6}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} film are not located at exactly integral _d_-spacing positions, which indicates significant disorder in the material. Note that a Ca content x>0.5 creates a 1:2:3-alloy material in which the majority of the rare earth sites contain a divalent, instead of trivalent, cation in addition to the totally divalent cation occupation of the Ba site. This substitution should prove to be quite disruptive to the electronic properties of the CuO_{2} planes, leading to a material with characteristics of both the 1:2:3 structure, with trivalent and divalent cation site ordering, and of the so-called "infinite layer" tetragonal structure, which contains equivalent divalent sites between all the copper oxide layers.[45, 46, 47] Note, however, that the ideal infinite layer structure contains no copper oxide chains and no oxygen atoms in the plane of the divalent cations.

It is interesting to compare the properties of Ca-doped PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} films with films that are doped with other cations. Figure 2 shows the resistivity for three films of nominal composition Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, Pr_{0.5}Y_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, and Pr_{0.5}Sr_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. All of these films were grown at 680 degC. The Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin film has a resistivity that is slightly metallic, and a superconducting transition with T_{c}(onset) = 47 K and T_{c}(R=0)=35 K. We also have studied the magnetic field dependence of the superconducting transition, and find that T_{c}(mid) decreases by approximately 4 K in a magnetic field of 8 T. The room temperature resistivity is approximately 1 m\Omega cm. The Pr_{0.5}Y_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} film, in which trivalent Y is substituted for Pr, is initially semiconducting with a room temperature resistivity of 2.5 m\Omega cm. A superconducting onset is observed at \sim22 K, although no R=0 state is achieved. Thus, we see that Ca doping of PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} for x\leq 0.5, leads to films with a lower resistivity and a higher value of T_{c} than for Y-doped PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} of comparable doping levels. Note that a Pr_{0.5}Y_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} film, grown by single-target pulsed-laser deposition, displays somewhat different properties than an alloy film of the same composition that was grown by alternating between YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} and PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} targets, as we previously reported.[43] In that case, the Pr_{0.5}Y_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} film showed only semiconductorlike resistive behavior down to 4.2 K, with no evidence for a superconducting transition. Figure 2 also shows the resistivity for a Pr_{0.5}Sr_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin film. In this case, the divalent Sr cation, which is somewhat larger than Ca, is substituted onto the rare earth site. X-ray-diffraction data show that these Sr-doped films have expanded lattice constants relative to the undoped or Ca-doped films, which is consistent which the assumption that the larger Sr cation substitutes onto the rare-earth site. Note that while Ca substitution on the rare-earth site leads to hole-doping and superconductivity, Sr-doping does not, even though Sr is also a divalent cation. This illustrates the importance of cation size in determining effective dopant candidates. This result is consistent with the observation that, for a given Pr concentration, T_{c} decreases as the rare earth-site ion size increases in R_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}.[14, 15, 48]

It is significant that the superconducting properties of Pr_{1-x}Ca_{1-x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} films depend quite strongly on growth temperature. The Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} film with the highest T_{c} was grown at 680 degC. Figure 3 shows resistance vs temperature for Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} films grown on SrTiO_{3} at various temperatures. In contrast, a film grown at 780 degC exhibits an onset temperature of only \sim12 K with T_{c}(R=0) less than 4.2 K. The 680 degC growth temperature at which we obtained Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} films with the highest T_{c} is significantly lower than the 780 degC optimum temperature for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} growth. This reflects the fact that Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} with x>0.3 is a metastable phase, which necessitates the use of lower growth temperatures.

Furthermore, we have not detected a superconducting transition in any bulk Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} samples. This inability to make the bulk material superconducting,  while thin films are, appears to be related to an inability to properly incorporate large amounts of Ca into the bulk compound. Other examples of metastable copper oxide formation by means of epitaxial film growth include Ce substitution into YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Ref. [49]) and growth of the tetragonal phase of (Sr, Ca)CuO_{2} (Ref. [47]).

In addition to studying the resistivity of these thin films, we also have measured their transport critical current density J_{c}. The J_{c} values were somewhat smaller than for epitaxial YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin films, although the values are respectable considering that the films are a mixture of a- and c-axis perpendicular grains. Figure 4 shows J_{c}(T) in zero magnetic field for a Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin film. J_{c} at 4.2 K is 105 A/cm^{2}. Also shown is the magnetic field dependence of J_{c} (4.2 K). This fairly high value for J_{c} confirms that we are observing bulk superconductivity in Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, although it is lower than J_{c} for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} epitaxial thin films by more than an order of magnitude. This may be due to disorder, as we have evidence from x-ray diffraction that some disorder is introduced by Ca doping at these high (metastable) levels. This disorder may occur because significant Ca substitution on the Pr site essentially converts a material with well-ordered trivalent and divalent cation sites (R Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, where R is a rare-earth element) into one in which half of the rare-earth sites are occupied by divalent cations, and blurs the distinction between the rare-earth and Ba sites. Even though this high level of substitution introduces disorder, we see that Ca doping at x\geq 0.4 provides sufficient hole carrier density to induce bulk superconductivity.

In addition to the transport properties, we also have studied the structural properties of Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin films utilizing four-circle x-ray diffraction. Inam and co-workers have shown that PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} epitaxial thin films tend to grow with the a axis instead of the c axis perpendicular to the substrate at reduced substrate temperatures. [50, 51] We find this to be even more strongly the case for Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. X-ray-diffraction data show a greater percentage of material growing with the a axis perpendicular to the substrate, as the growth temperature is reduced from 730 to 640degC. Somewhat surprisingly, all of the Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} samples grown in this temperature range contain both a-axis and c-axis perpendicular material, even films grown under conditions (T=730degC) for which only c-axis perpendicular YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} films are obtained.

Within each sample, an interesting difference between the a-axis and c-axis perpendicular material is observed in that both the lattice parameters and crystal structure depend on grain orientation. [43] The c-axis perpendicular material is nearly tetragonal for all of the Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin films that we studied. \theta-2\theta scans through the (205)c  and _b_-axis lattice constants remain relatively constant with a = b  3.87 A for the _c_-axis perpendicular grains and a = 3.835 A, b  3.89 A for the _a_-axis perpendicular material.

We also have measured the lattice parameters as a function of Ca content, as shown in Fig. 6. All of these films were grown at 680 degC. As the Ca content is increased, the _a_- and _b_-axes decrease, while the _c_-axis increases. If one only considers the substitution of Ca for Pr, then significant changes in the lattice parameters are not expected, based upon the bond-length-predicting radii for eightfold coordinated Pr+3 (0.1126 nm) and Ca+2 (0.112 nm). However, disorder, as evidenced by an increase in the mosaic spread of the diffraction peaks, also increases with the Ca content. This second point is not difficult to understand, since increasing the Ca content increases the fraction of rare-earth sites that are occupied by divalent cations. This makes the chemical distinction between Ba sites and rare-earth sites (a significant fraction of which are occupied by divalent Ca) less clear, leading to disorder that possibly involves a change in coordination of either the rare-earth or Ba site. The increase in the _c_-axis lattice parameter as the Ca content is increased is more difficult to explain, and may involve differences in oxygen content as the Ca content is increased.

It is interesting to consider the properties of Pr0,Ca0,Ba2Cu3O7-8 thin films grown on substrates other than (100) SrTiO3. It is conceivable that the observed superconducting transition is due to a thin substrate/film interaction layer. If this were the case, then a superconducting transition would be observed for films grown on a specific substrate material, while not on others. Figure 7 shows the normalized resistance for Pr0,Ca0,Ba2Cu3O7-8 thin films grown at 655 degC on SrTiO3 (100), LaAlO3 (100), MgO (100), and polycrystalline yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). A superconducting transition is observed for all of these films, thus ruling out a film/substrate interaction layer as the origin of the superconducting behavior. Earlier, we pointed out that _T_c increased as the growth temperature decreased (Fig. 3), and that the volume fraction of _a_-axis perpendicular material also increased, suggesting a correlation between _T_c and the fraction of _a_-axis oriented material. Since a superconducting transition is observed for Pr0,Ca0,Ba2Cu3O7-8 films grown on MgO (100) (film predominantly _c_-axis oriented) and on polycrystalline YSZ (polycrystalline film), it does not appear that a high

  ly _a_-axis-oriented film is necessary for superconductivity. However, it is clear that the superconducting properties of this material are strongly enhanced [higher T_{c}(R = 0)] when a strong epitaxial relationship does exist between the film and substrate. More importantly, Pr0.5Ca0.5Ba2Cu3O7-8 is essentially a metastable phase, as these films exceed the bulk solubility limit of x <= 0.3 that has been observed for bulk samples. The incorporation of Ca above the apparent bulk solubility limit can be attributed to the low-temperature growth conditions utilized, and to the strong epitaxial relationship between the film and substrate. This is similar to what has been observed in the growth of the tetragonal infinite layer phase of (Sr,Ca)CuO2.47

These experiments strongly support the idea that Pr suppresses T_{c} in PrBa2Cu3O7-8 in part by reducing the mobile hole concentration. The fact that replacing Y by Pr in YBa2Cu3O7-8 transforms a metal into a semiconductor suggests this argument. The demonstration in this work that PrBa2Cu3O7-8 can be made superconducting by Ca substitution on the Pr site also supports this view. The primary result of Ca doping is to introduce additional holes into the CuO2 planes to compensate the hole localization due to the hybridization of the Pr 4f states with the CuO2 valence bands. If magnetic pair-breaking were the only cause of the suppression of T_{c}, it would be difficult to explain how Ca doping could compensate for it. In fact, Ca doping produces superconductivity in Pr0.6Ca0.4Ba2Cu3O7-8 with T_{c}(onset) = 25 K, while Pr0.6Y0.4Ba2Cu3O7-8 does not superconduct, so hole localization must be a primary cause of the suppression of T_{c}.

As was pointed out earlier, Neumeier _et al._ reported similar results for the (Y1-_x_-_y_Ca)PrBa2Cu3O7-8 system.39 Based upon their results for 0 <= x <= 0.2 and 0 <= y <= 0.2, they derived an empirical expression for the dependence of T_{c} on the Y, Pr, and Ca content,

\[T_{c}(x_{s}y) = 97\text{ K} - (425\text{ K})(0.1-0.95x_{s}+y)^{2}\]

\[- (96.5\text{ K})x\text{ }.\]

This equation predicts T_{c} = 42.2\text{ K} for Pr0.5Ca0.5Ba2Cu3O7-8, which is somewhat less than the 47-K superconducting onset temperature that we observe. However, this equation predicts that the maximum value for T_{c} will occur at x ~= 0.5, which is quite consistent with our results.

It must be noted that, as Ca doping apparently cannot fully compensate the suppression of T_{c} by Pr, a mechanism in addition to hole localization must be involved. An interesting result showing that the suppression of T_{c} with Pr doping is not entirely due to hole localization has been presented by Takita and Oshima.53 They measured the Hall coefficient for Ca-doped and Nd-doped PrBa2Cu3O7-8 bulk samples, and showed that samples of these two alloys could be prepared with very similar values of the inverse Hall coefficient 1/_R__H_ but with very different transport properties. In particular, they found that the magnitude and temperature dependence of 1/_R__H_ for (Pr0.1Nd0.9)(Ba1.9Nd0.1)Cu3O7-8 and Pr0.7Ca0.3Ba2Cu3O7-8 were nearly the same, with the former a superconductor with T_{c} = 64\text{ K}, and the latter an insulator, even though the Hall data suggest comparable mobile carrier densities. In addition, Iwasaki, Sugawara, and Kobayashi showed that, while T_{c} and conductivity systematically decrease with Pr doping in Nd1-_x_Pr_AsBa2Cu3O7-8, the inverse Hall coefficient becomes almost constant for x > 0.2 suggesting carrier scattering and localization.54 This suggests that another mechanism besides simply hole localization plays a role in the suppression of superconductivity in Pr-doped 1:2:3 compounds. As was pointed out earlier, strong hybridization of Pr 4f electrons with the CuO2 valence band appears to occur, and could lead to both magnetic pair breaking and hole localization from the same mechanism.

In conclusion, we have studied the structural and transport properties of Pr1-_x_Ca,Ba2Cu3O7-8 epitaxial thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition. We show that bulk superconductivity is induced in PrBa2Cu3O7-8 by hole-doping with Ca substitution. The main significance of superconductivity in this material is in showing that hole doping by Ca substitution partially compensates the suppression of superconductivity by Pr, without the confusing possibility that a percolative path of YBa2Cu3O7-8 exists to give the superconducting behavior. This result cannot be explained within the context of magnetic pair breaking alone, and provides convincing evidence that hole localization is partially responsible for the suppression of superconductivity by Pr in R Ba2Cu3O7-8. This result also demonstrates the utility of epitaxial thin film growth in the formation of metastable materials.

###### Abstract

We have studied the transport and structural properties of Pr1-_x_Ca_x Ba2Cu3O7-_b_ thin films grown by pulsed-laser deposition, focusing on Ca substitution levels x >= 0.3 for which the bulk material is metastable. Films with 0.4 <= x <= 0.5 exhibit a superconducting transition due to divalent cation doping on the rare-earth site. Pr0.5Ca0.5Ba2Cu3O7-_b_ epitaxial thin films exhibit a superconducting onset temperature as high as 47 K with _T_c(_R_ = 0) = 35 K. X-ray-diffraction and electrical-transport data suggest that Ca doping levels greater than x = 0.5 are possible, although disorder is introduced as the divalent to trivalent cation ratio becomes large. This work demonstrates that 1:2:3-phase superconductivity can be achieved by substituting Ca for Pr, without the presence in the alloy of Y or any other rare-earth element, R, for which _R_Ba2Cu3O7-_b_ is superconducting. This result supports the view that hole localization, due to hybridization of the Pr 4f electronic levels with the O 2p orbitals, contributes substantially to the suppression of superconductivity by Pr in PrBa2Cu3O7-_b_, and demonstrates that this suppression can be partially compensated by appropriate hole doping with Ca.

## I Introduction

The superconducting properties of the materials R Ba2Cu3O7-_b_ are nearly independent of the rare-earth element R.[1,2] This is surprising as many of the lanthanide elements possess magnetic moments, normally a condition detrimental to superconductivity, and indicates that the CuO2 planes and the rare-earth ions are electronically isolated. The exceptions to this behavior are Ce, Tb, and Pr, which do not form superconductors, with only Pr forming a single-phase "1:2:3" structure. PrBa2Cu3O7-_b_ is a semiconductor,[3, 4, 5] but it is quite similar to the superconducting 1:2:3 compounds in structure and oxygen chemistry, undergoing the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition at values of temperature and oxygen content close to those for YBa2Cu3O7-_b_.[6] However, substitution of Pr on the rare-earth site, R, in R1-_x_ Pr,Ba2Cu3O7-_b_ suppresses _T_c with superconductivity disappearing at x > 0.5.[3, 4, 5]

Much of the discussion concerning the suppression of 1:2:3-phase superconductivity by Pr has centered around its valence. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that the Pr valence is nearly + 4.[5,17] Neutron-diffraction investigations of the separation of the CuO2 planes in PrBa2Cu3O7-_b_ lead to the conclusion that Pr has a mixed valence greater than 3.[18,19] X-ray-absorption spectroscopy studies comparing Pr, Gd and Ho in 1:2:3-phase compounds revealed features attributable to both Pr+3 and Pr+4, again suggesting a mixed-valence system.[20] A formal valence greater than + 3 for Pr in PrBa2Cu3O7-_b_ would explain both the lack of superconductivity and the semiconducting behavior, since Pr could contribute electrons to the CuO2 planes, filling the mobile holes responsible for conduction.[21] However, some resonant valence-band photoemission, x-ray absorption, and structural studies suggest that Pr is trivalent in PrBa2Cu3O7-_b_.[22,23] Obviously, there is some confusion over the valence of Pr in PrBa2Cu3O7-_b_.

Lopez-Morales _et al._ suggest that the value obtained for the valence of Pr in PrBa2Cu3O7-_b_ depends on whether an experiment measures properties associated with the Pr--O bond (that would yield Pr+4) or the charge near the Pr site (that would indicate Pr+3).[6] They consider the formal valence of Pr to be + 3, but with significant hybridization of the Pr 4f states with the CuO2 valence bands leading to mixed-valence character as well.[6, 24, 25, 26] A large body of experimental evidence and band-structure calculations suggest that significant hybridization of the Pr 4f states with the CuO2 valence bands occurs due to the larger radial extent of the Pr ion.[27, 28, 29, 30, 9] Within this model, most, if not all, of the experimental data on PrBa2Cu3O7-_b_ can be interpreted consistently.

Two mechanisms have been proposed for the suppression of _T_c by Pr in the 1:2:3 phase. The first involves superconducting pair breaking by local moments, due to spin-dependent exchange scattering of the holes in the CuO2 planes.[7, 8, 24] The reduction of _T_c with increasing x in Y1-_x_Pr_Ba2Cu3O7-_b_ appears to follow the Abrikosov-Gorkov pair-breaking model. However, the Abrikosov-Gorkov model does not predict the occurrence of a metal-to-insulator transition to accompany this suppression of superconductivity, although this is observed experimentally as x is increased. In addition, other rare-earth elements, such as Gd, possess a much larger spin magnetic moment, with no apparent effect on _T_c. However, hybridization of the Pr 4f electrons with the CuO2 valence band could lead to magnetic pair breaking.[8, 9, 24] The second mechanism for suppression of _T_c by Pr involves the filling and/or localization of holes available for conduction in the CuO2 planes. If the valence of Pr is nearly + 4, the additional electron contributed by  the Pr ion (relative to Y) is expected to fill mobile holes in the CuO2 planes, effectively leaving the holes localized on the Pr, reducing conduction and eliminating superconductivity. This view appears to be too simplistic as recent evidence from electron energy loss and soft- x-ray-absorption spectroscopy suggest that the _total_ hole concentration is unaffected by Pr content in Y1-_x_Pr_x_Ba_Cu_3O7-_d_.[31, 32] An alternative view is that strong hybridization of the Pr 4f with O 2p states leads to localization of the holes without requiring a Pr formal valence greater than +3 or significant changes in the _total_ hole (mobile and trapped) concentration, although the mobile hole concentration does decrease as indicated by Hall,[33, 34] Cu NMR,[35] mid-ir ellipsometric,[36] and muon-spin relaxation measurement.[6, 37, 31] As with magnetic pair breaking, the mechanism for hole localization is intimately related to the strongly hybridized mixed valency of the Pr.[38]

Some rather convincing evidence that Pr produces hole localization that suppresses superconductivity has been presented in studies of the superconducting behavior of Y1-_x_-_y_Ca_p_Pr_x_Ba_Cu_3O7-_d_ alloys.[39-41] The substitution of Ca for Y should add holes to the CuO2 planes. If Pr reduces the _mobile_ hole concentration available for conduction in the CuO2 planes, then the addition of holes by Ca should compensate the effect of Pr in suppressing _T_e. This behavior has indeed been observed. However, the presence of Y in all the samples considered (0 <= x <= 0.2, 0 <= y <= 0.2) somewhat complicates the interpretation of their results because of the possibility that phase separation yields Y-rich regions, which could form a percolative path.[42] Ideally, one would like to investigate hole doping by Ca in the absence of Y or any other element R for which R Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ is superconducting. Previously, we reported that metastable Pr0.5Ca0.5Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ films, which are fully superconducting with _T_e(_R_ = 0)~35 K, can be grown by pulsed-laser deposition.[43] The superconducting transition obviously cannot be the result of phase segregation of a stable superconducting phase as there are no such phases known involving only Pr or Ca. This result supports the view that hole localization is at least partially responsible for the suppression of superconductivity by Pr in 1:2:3-phase compounds.

In this paper, we report on the transport and structural properties of Pr1-_x_Ca_x_Ba_Cu_3O7-_d_ thin films grown by pulsed-laser deposition, focusing on Ca substitution levels x >= 0.3 for which the bulk material is metastable. Films with 0.4 <= x <= 0.5 exhibit a superconducting transition due to divalent cation doping on the rare-earth site. Although superconductivity is induced due to the addition of holes through Ca substitution, x-ray-diffraction data suggest that disorder also is introduced, particularly for x > 0.5. Pr0.5Ca0.5Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ epitaxial thin films exhibit a superconducting onset temperature as high as 47 K, with _T_e(_R_ = 0)= 35 K. Critical current densities as high as 105 A/cm2 at 4.2 K have been measured as well. Apparently, 1:2:3-phase superconductivity can be achieved by substituting Ca for Pr, without the presence of the alloy of Y or any other rare-earth element R for which R Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ is superconducting. This result is consistent with the view that hole localization, due to hybridization of the Pr 4f electronic levels with the O 2p orbitals, contributes substantially to the suppression of superconductivity by Pr in PrBa2Cu3O7-_d_, and demonstrates that this suppression can be partially compensated by appropriate hole doping with Ca.

## II Results and discussion

Pr1-_x_Ca_Ba_Cu_3O7-_d_ epitaxial thin films were grown by pulsed-laser ablation as has been described elsewhere.[44]

Pressed and fired ceramic targets of Pr1-_x_Ca_Ba_Cu_3O7-_d_ were prepared from stoichiometric quantities of high-purity Pr6O11, CaCO3, BaCO3, and CuO in a manner similar to that used to produce superconducting _R_-1:2:3 pellets. Powder x-ray diffraction indicated that the resulting ceramic targets were composed of material with the tetragonal 1:2:3 structure along with a small amount of BaCuO2. (001) SrTiO3 substrates were utilized for most of these experiments, although LaAlO3, MgO, yttria-stabilized zirconia and KTaO3 substrates sometimes were included. Film growth was carried out in an oxygen pressure of 200 mTorr. After deposition, the films were cooled in 400 Torr of oxygen at 10 degC/min. Throughout this paper, the growth temperature refers to the heater temperature as measured by an attached thermocouple. The film composition was assumed to be the same as the target composition which is typically the case for pulsed-laser deposition.

Figure 1(a) shows the resistivity for three thin-film

Figure 1: Resistivity as a function of temperature for Pr1-_x_Ca_Ba_Cu_3O7-_d_ thin films with (a) x = 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and (b) x = 0.6. Films were grown at 680 °C on (100) SrTiO3.

  samples with Ca contents of x=0.3,0.4,0.5. Resistivity was measured using a standard four-point method with the current density less than 10 A/cm^{2}. As seen in the figure, the resistivity decreases as the Ca concentration increases, consistent with the view that substituting a divalent into a rare-earth site hole dopes the material. A superconducting transition was observed for both the Pr_{0.6}Ca_{0.4}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} [T_{c} (onset)] ~ 25 K, T_{c}(R=0)\sim 10 K] and the Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} [T_{c}(onset) ~ 47 K, T_{c}(R=0)\sim 35 K] samples, with no transition observed for the Pr_{0.7}Ca_{0.3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} film. ac magnetic susceptibility measurements on the Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin films also indicated a superconducting transition. For Pr_{0.4}Ca_{0.6}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin films, no R=0 superconducting state was observed, although the resistivity demonstrated a reentrant behavior, as seen in Fig. 1(b). This reentrant behavior suggests that a small volume fraction of superconducting material with T_{c}(onset) ~ 47 K, is present in the material. Although this behavior is reminiscent of a mixed-phase material, this does not appear to be the case here as no impurity peaks were observed in the x-ray-diffraction pattern for this film. However, significant broadening of the 1:2:3 x-ray-diffraction peaks was evident. In addition, the (00_l_) peaks for the Pr_{0.4}Ca_{0.6}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} film are not located at exactly integral _d_-spacing positions, which indicates significant disorder in the material. Note that a Ca content x>0.5 creates a 1:2:3-alloy material in which the majority of the rare earth sites contain a divalent, instead of trivalent, cation in addition to the totally divalent cation occupation of the Ba site. This substitution should prove to be quite disruptive to the electronic properties of the CuO_{2} planes, leading to a material with characteristics of both the 1:2:3 structure, with trivalent and divalent cation site ordering, and of the so-called "infinite layer" tetragonal structure, which contains equivalent divalent sites between all the copper oxide layers.[45, 46, 47] Note, however, that the ideal infinite layer structure contains no copper oxide chains and no oxygen atoms in the plane of the divalent cations.

It is interesting to compare the properties of Ca-doped PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} films with films that are doped with other cations. Figure 2 shows the resistivity for three films of nominal composition Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, Pr_{0.5}Y_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, and Pr_{0.5}Sr_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. All of these films were grown at 680 degC. The Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin film has a resistivity that is slightly metallic, and a superconducting transition with T_{c}(onset) = 47 K and T_{c}(R=0)=35 K. We also have studied the magnetic field dependence of the superconducting transition, and find that T_{c}(mid) decreases by approximately 4 K in a magnetic field of 8 T. The room temperature resistivity is approximately 1 m\Omega cm. The Pr_{0.5}Y_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} film, in which trivalent Y is substituted for Pr, is initially semiconducting with a room temperature resistivity of 2.5 m\Omega cm. A superconducting onset is observed at \sim22 K, although no R=0 state is achieved. Thus, we see that Ca doping of PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} for x\leq 0.5, leads to films with a lower resistivity and a higher value of T_{c} than for Y-doped PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} of comparable doping levels. Note that a Pr_{0.5}Y_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} film, grown by single-target pulsed-laser deposition, displays somewhat different properties than an alloy film of the same composition that was grown by alternating between YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} and PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} targets, as we previously reported.[43] In that case, the Pr_{0.5}Y_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} film showed only semiconductorlike resistive behavior down to 4.2 K, with no evidence for a superconducting transition. Figure 2 also shows the resistivity for a Pr_{0.5}Sr_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin film. In this case, the divalent Sr cation, which is somewhat larger than Ca, is substituted onto the rare earth site. X-ray-diffraction data show that these Sr-doped films have expanded lattice constants relative to the undoped or Ca-doped films, which is consistent which the assumption that the larger Sr cation substitutes onto the rare-earth site. Note that while Ca substitution on the rare-earth site leads to hole-doping and superconductivity, Sr-doping does not, even though Sr is also a divalent cation. This illustrates the importance of cation size in determining effective dopant candidates. This result is consistent with the observation that, for a given Pr concentration, T_{c} decreases as the rare earth-site ion size increases in R_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}.[14, 15, 48]

It is significant that the superconducting properties of Pr_{1-x}Ca_{1-x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} films depend quite strongly on growth temperature. The Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} film with the highest T_{c} was grown at 680 degC. Figure 3 shows resistance vs temperature for Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} films grown on SrTiO_{3} at various temperatures. In contrast, a film grown at 780 degC exhibits an onset temperature of only \sim12 K with T_{c}(R=0) less than 4.2 K. The 680 degC growth temperature at which we obtained Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} films with the highest T_{c} is significantly lower than the 780 degC optimum temperature for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} growth. This reflects the fact that Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} with x>0.3 is a metastable phase, which necessitates the use of lower growth temperatures.

Furthermore, we have not detected a superconducting transition in any bulk Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} samples. This inability to make the bulk material superconducting,  while thin films are, appears to be related to an inability to properly incorporate large amounts of Ca into the bulk compound. Other examples of metastable copper oxide formation by means of epitaxial film growth include Ce substitution into YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Ref. [49]) and growth of the tetragonal phase of (Sr, Ca)CuO_{2} (Ref. [47]).

In addition to studying the resistivity of these thin films, we also have measured their transport critical current density J_{c}. The J_{c} values were somewhat smaller than for epitaxial YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin films, although the values are respectable considering that the films are a mixture of a- and c-axis perpendicular grains. Figure 4 shows J_{c}(T) in zero magnetic field for a Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin film. J_{c} at 4.2 K is 105 A/cm^{2}. Also shown is the magnetic field dependence of J_{c} (4.2 K). This fairly high value for J_{c} confirms that we are observing bulk superconductivity in Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, although it is lower than J_{c} for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} epitaxial thin films by more than an order of magnitude. This may be due to disorder, as we have evidence from x-ray diffraction that some disorder is introduced by Ca doping at these high (metastable) levels. This disorder may occur because significant Ca substitution on the Pr site essentially converts a material with well-ordered trivalent and divalent cation sites (R Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, where R is a rare-earth element) into one in which half of the rare-earth sites are occupied by divalent cations, and blurs the distinction between the rare-earth and Ba sites. Even though this high level of substitution introduces disorder, we see that Ca doping at x\geq 0.4 provides sufficient hole carrier density to induce bulk superconductivity.

In addition to the transport properties, we also have studied the structural properties of Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin films utilizing four-circle x-ray diffraction. Inam and co-workers have shown that PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} epitaxial thin films tend to grow with the a axis instead of the c axis perpendicular to the substrate at reduced substrate temperatures. [50, 51] We find this to be even more strongly the case for Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. X-ray-diffraction data show a greater percentage of material growing with the a axis perpendicular to the substrate, as the growth temperature is reduced from 730 to 640degC. Somewhat surprisingly, all of the Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} samples grown in this temperature range contain both a-axis and c-axis perpendicular material, even films grown under conditions (T=730degC) for which only c-axis perpendicular YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} films are obtained.

Within each sample, an interesting difference between the a-axis and c-axis perpendicular material is observed in that both the lattice parameters and crystal structure depend on grain orientation. [43] The c-axis perpendicular material is nearly tetragonal for all of the Pr_{1-x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} thin films that we studied. \theta-2\theta scans through the (205)c  and _b_-axis lattice constants remain relatively constant with a = b  3.87 A for the _c_-axis perpendicular grains and a = 3.835 A, b  3.89 A for the _a_-axis perpendicular material.

We also have measured the lattice parameters as a function of Ca content, as shown in Fig. 6. All of these films were grown at 680 degC. As the Ca content is increased, the _a_- and _b_-axes decrease, while the _c_-axis increases. If one only considers the substitution of Ca for Pr, then significant changes in the lattice parameters are not expected, based upon the bond-length-predicting radii for eightfold coordinated Pr+3 (0.1126 nm) and Ca+2 (0.112 nm). However, disorder, as evidenced by an increase in the mosaic spread of the diffraction peaks, also increases with the Ca content. This second point is not difficult to understand, since increasing the Ca content increases the fraction of rare-earth sites that are occupied by divalent cations. This makes the chemical distinction between Ba sites and rare-earth sites (a significant fraction of which are occupied by divalent Ca) less clear, leading to disorder that possibly involves a change in coordination of either the rare-earth or Ba site. The increase in the _c_-axis lattice parameter as the Ca content is increased is more difficult to explain, and may involve differences in oxygen content as the Ca content is increased.

It is interesting to consider the properties of Pr0,Ca0,Ba2Cu3O7-8 thin films grown on substrates other than (100) SrTiO3. It is conceivable that the observed superconducting transition is due to a thin substrate/film interaction layer. If this were the case, then a superconducting transition would be observed for films grown on a specific substrate material, while not on others. Figure 7 shows the normalized resistance for Pr0,Ca0,Ba2Cu3O7-8 thin films grown at 655 degC on SrTiO3 (100), LaAlO3 (100), MgO (100), and polycrystalline yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). A superconducting transition is observed for all of these films, thus ruling out a film/substrate interaction layer as the origin of the superconducting behavior. Earlier, we pointed out that _T_c increased as the growth temperature decreased (Fig. 3), and that the volume fraction of _a_-axis perpendicular material also increased, suggesting a correlation between _T_c and the fraction of _a_-axis oriented material. Since a superconducting transition is observed for Pr0,Ca0,Ba2Cu3O7-8 films grown on MgO (100) (film predominantly _c_-axis oriented) and on polycrystalline YSZ (polycrystalline film), it does not appear that a high

  ly _a_-axis-oriented film is necessary for superconductivity. However, it is clear that the superconducting properties of this material are strongly enhanced [higher T_{c}(R = 0)] when a strong epitaxial relationship does exist between the film and substrate. More importantly, Pr0.5Ca0.5Ba2Cu3O7-8 is essentially a metastable phase, as these films exceed the bulk solubility limit of x <= 0.3 that has been observed for bulk samples. The incorporation of Ca above the apparent bulk solubility limit can be attributed to the low-temperature growth conditions utilized, and to the strong epitaxial relationship between the film and substrate. This is similar to what has been observed in the growth of the tetragonal infinite layer phase of (Sr,Ca)CuO2.47

These experiments strongly support the idea that Pr suppresses T_{c} in PrBa2Cu3O7-8 in part by reducing the mobile hole concentration. The fact that replacing Y by Pr in YBa2Cu3O7-8 transforms a metal into a semiconductor suggests this argument. The demonstration in this work that PrBa2Cu3O7-8 can be made superconducting by Ca substitution on the Pr site also supports this view. The primary result of Ca doping is to introduce additional holes into the CuO2 planes to compensate the hole localization due to the hybridization of the Pr 4f states with the CuO2 valence bands. If magnetic pair-breaking were the only cause of the suppression of T_{c}, it would be difficult to explain how Ca doping could compensate for it. In fact, Ca doping produces superconductivity in Pr0.6Ca0.4Ba2Cu3O7-8 with T_{c}(onset) = 25 K, while Pr0.6Y0.4Ba2Cu3O7-8 does not superconduct, so hole localization must be a primary cause of the suppression of T_{c}.

As was pointed out earlier, Neumeier _et al._ reported similar results for the (Y1-_x_-_y_Ca)PrBa2Cu3O7-8 system.39 Based upon their results for 0 <= x <= 0.2 and 0 <= y <= 0.2, they derived an empirical expression for the dependence of T_{c} on the Y, Pr, and Ca content,

\[T_{c}(x_{s}y) = 97\text{ K} - (425\text{ K})(0.1-0.95x_{s}+y)^{2}\]

\[- (96.5\text{ K})x\text{ }.\]

This equation predicts T_{c} = 42.2\text{ K} for Pr0.5Ca0.5Ba2Cu3O7-8, which is somewhat less than the 47-K superconducting onset temperature that we observe. However, this equation predicts that the maximum value for T_{c} will occur at x ~= 0.5, which is quite consistent with our results.

It must be noted that, as Ca doping apparently cannot fully compensate the suppression of T_{c} by Pr, a mechanism in addition to hole localization must be involved. An interesting result showing that the suppression of T_{c} with Pr doping is not entirely due to hole localization has been presented by Takita and Oshima.53 They measured the Hall coefficient for Ca-doped and Nd-doped PrBa2Cu3O7-8 bulk samples, and showed that samples of these two alloys could be prepared with very similar values of the inverse Hall coefficient 1/_R__H_ but with very different transport properties. In particular, they found that the magnitude and temperature dependence of 1/_R__H_ for (Pr0.1Nd0.9)(Ba1.9Nd0.1)Cu3O7-8 and Pr0.7Ca0.3Ba2Cu3O7-8 were nearly the same, with the former a superconductor with T_{c} = 64\text{ K}, and the latter an insulator, even though the Hall data suggest comparable mobile carrier densities. In addition, Iwasaki, Sugawara, and Kobayashi showed that, while T_{c} and conductivity systematically decrease with Pr doping in Nd1-_x_Pr_AsBa2Cu3O7-8, the inverse Hall coefficient becomes almost constant for x > 0.2 suggesting carrier scattering and localization.54 This suggests that another mechanism besides simply hole localization plays a role in the suppression of superconductivity in Pr-doped 1:2:3 compounds. As was pointed out earlier, strong hybridization of Pr 4f electrons with the CuO2 valence band appears to occur, and could lead to both magnetic pair breaking and hole localization from the same mechanism.

In conclusion, we have studied the structural and transport properties of Pr1-_x_Ca,Ba2Cu3O7-8 epitaxial thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition. We show that bulk superconductivity is induced in PrBa2Cu3O7-8 by hole-doping with Ca substitution. The main significance of superconductivity in this material is in showing that hole doping by Ca substitution partially compensates the suppression of superconductivity by Pr, without the confusing possibility that a percolative path of YBa2Cu3O7-8 exists to give the superconducting behavior. This result cannot be explained within the context of magnetic pair breaking alone, and provides convincing evidence that hole localization is partially responsible for the suppression of superconductivity by Pr in R Ba2Cu3O7-8. This result also demonstrates the utility of epitaxial thin film growth in the formation of metastable materials.
