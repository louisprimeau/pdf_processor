Y. Liu (\lambda)\backslash\ superconductivity with maximum T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset} of 2.5 K was observed near CDW. The superconducting volume is very small inside the CDW phase and becomes very large instantly when the CDW phase is fully suppressed. Our observations can be clearly understood based on the PLD mechanism. The volume variation of superconductivity implies the emergence of domain walls when the CDW phase is suppressed.

## II Experiment and Calculation Details

Single crystals were grown by the chemical vapor transport (CVT) method with iodine as a transport agent. The high-purity elements Ta (4N), Se (4N), and Te (4N) were mixed in chemical stoichiometry, and heated at 900 degC for 4 days in an evacuated quartz tube. The harvested TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x} powders and iodine (5 mg/cm^{3}) were then heated for 15 days in a two-zone furnace, where the temperatures of the source and growth zones were fixed at 950 degC and 850 degC, respectively.

The x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Philips X'pert PRO diffractometer with Cu K_{\alpha} radiation (\lambda = 1.5418 A). Structural refinements were performed by using the Rietveld method with the x'pert highscore plus software. Electron diffraction and high-angle annular dark-field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) experiments were performed in the JEOL ARM200F equipped with double aberration correctors and a cold field emission gun operated at 200 kV. For the STEM images, the convergence angle is 28 mrad and the collection angle of the HAADF detector is between 90 and 370 mrad. Under this condition, the spatial resolution is about 0.08 nm. The resistivity was measured by the standard four-probe ac technique using the Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). Measurement of the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility and the isothermal hysteresis loop were carried out in the Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS) equipped with a ^{3}He cryostat.

  The first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were carried out using the quantum espresso package [34] with ultrasoft pseudopotentials. The exchange-correlation interaction was treated with the local density approximation (LDA) according to Perdew and Zunger [35]. The energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set was 35 Ry. Brillouin-zone sampling is performed on the Monkhorst-Pack (MP) mesh [36] of 32 x 32 x 8. The Vanderbilt-Marzari Fermi smearing method with a smearing parameter of \sigma=0.02 Ry was used for the calculations of the total energy and electron charge density. Phonon dispersions were calculated using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) [37] with an 8 x 8 x 4 mesh of \bm{q} points. In order to investigate the distribution of CDW instability around the \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}}, 16 x 16 x 1 \bm{q} points were used. Denser 64 x 64 x 8 \bm{k} points are used for electron-phonon coupling.

## III Results and Discussion

### Superconducting dome near CDWs

The x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x} (_x_ = 0, 1, and 2) single crystals are shown in Fig. 1(d), in which only (00l) reflections were observed, suggesting the c axis is perpendicular to the surface of the crystal. With increasing x, the diffraction peaks distinctly shift to lower angles, reflecting the crystal expansion induced by Te doping. Figure 1(e) shows the powder XRD patterns and the structural refinement results of Rietveld analysis for the selected samples with x = 0, 1, and 2. Figure 1(f) shows the enlargement of the (011) peak for x = 1, 1.5, and 2. The undistorted CdI_{2}-type 1T structure for x = 1 leads to a single (011) peak, while there are double peaks resulting from the monoclinic distorted-1T structure for x = 2. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the (011) peak starts to split when x = 1.5, indicating the emergence of a distorted-1T structure, i.e., the critical point between the 1_T_-structure and monoclinic structure is close to x = 1.5. The evolution of the lattice parameters (_a_, _c_) and unit-cell volume (_V_) of 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x} is depicted in Fig. 1(g). Indeed, the values of a, c, and V monotonously increase with x, in accordance with the larger ion radius of Te than that of Se.

Figures 1(h) and 1(i) demonstrate two typical diffraction patterns taken along the [001] zone-axis direction of 1_T_-TaSe_{2} and 1_T_-TaSeTe, respectively. The superstructure reflections corresponding to the commensurate phase with \bm{q}_{\text{CCDW}}=\frac{3}{13}\bm{a}^{*}+\frac{1}{13}\bm{b}^{*} can be clearly observed in Fig. 1(h), which is evidently different from the diffuse superlattice spots with the incommensurated in-plane \bm{q} vector in 1_T_-TaSeTe [Fig. 1(i)]. A similar result was previously reported by Luo _et al._[38] and a possible chemical-origin, short-range Se/Te ordering was proposed. However, the detailed analysis based on the HAADF-STEM images seen from both [001] [Fig. 1(j)] and [100] [Fig. 1(k)] zone-axis directions suggests the disordered Se/Te distribution in the 1_T_-TaSeTe, which is significantly different from the ordered S/Se distribution in 1_T_-TaSSe [33].

Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the temperature dependence of the in-plane resistivity ratio (\rho/\rho_{250\,\text{K}}) of 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x} single crystals. The Te doping largely decreases the residual resistivity ratio (RRR = \rho_{300\,\text{K}}/\rho_{3\,\text{K}}). For 1_T_-TaSe_{2}, RRR = 17.4. For 1_T_-TaSeTe, RRR = 0.85, reflecting the substantial doping-induced disorder, which is corresponding to our HAADF-STEM observation. The signature of superconductivity emerges as x >= 0.3, and finally disappears for x >= 1.3, while the zero resistances are observed when 0.5 < x < 1.3 [Fig. 2(a)]. The maximum of superconducting onset temperature (T_{c}^{\text{onset}}) of 2.5 K and the maximum of zero-resistance temperature (T_{c}^{\text{zero}}) of 1.6 K are found when the CDW phase is completely suppressed (_x_ = 0.6). Figures 2(c) and 2(d) show the magnetic properties with both the zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) modes of 1_T_-TaSe_{1.4}Te_{0.6} (optimal sample) and 1_T_-TaSe_{1.5}Te_{0.5} at H = 10 Oe with the magnetic field parallel to the c axis, respectively. The results indicate very small superconducting volume (4p _kh_ = 2.7 x 10-3 at 0.5 K in ZFC) in 1_T_-TaSe_{1.5}Te_{0.5} (in which the CDW phase still exists) and large superconducting volume (4p _kh_ = 0.35 at 0.5 K in ZFC) in 1_T_-TaSe_{1.4}Te_{0.6} (in which the CDW phase is just completely suppressed). The inset of Fig. 2(c) shows the magnetization hysteresis loop _M_(_H_) obtained at T = 0.5 K, indicating it is a typical type-II superconductor. Figure 2(e) summarizes the overall phase diagram in 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x}. The domelike superconducting phase is near the CDW phase, which is similar to that in 1_T_-TaS_{2-x}Se_{x}[14]. In the phase diagram, the CDW phase is gradually suppressed by Te doping and disappears as x > 0.5, which is quite different from the situation in 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Se_{x}[14]. With higher Te content x > 1.5, the crystal structure gradually distorts to a monoclinic one with the C2/_m_ space group, which could also be considered as a single-\bm{q} CDW-type distortion [6,30].

### Mechanisms of CDWs and superconductivity

The low-symmetry CDW structure is usually considered as the high-symmetry phase with distortion introduced by some instability. Since our prepared 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x} samples for x < 1.5 are all in the pure 1T phase according to the structure characterization, we performed the first-principles calculations using the 1T structure to explain our observation (Fig. 3). We first calculated the two end members of 1_T_-TaSe_{2} and hypothetical 1_T_-TaTe_{2}, respectively. The fully optimized structural parameters, listed in Table I, are close to those from the previous LDA calculation [32]. The underestimation of lattice parameters is expected for LDA [32].

Previous research has shown that the phonon calculation is an effective method to simulate the CDW instability [29, 30, 31, 32, 39, 40, 41]. Figures 3(a) and 3(j) show the phonon dispersions of 1_T_-TaSe_{2} and 1_T_-TaTe_{2}. For 1_T_-TaSe_{2}, the calculation is in good agreement with the previous calculation by Ge _et al._[32]. From Fig. 3(f), one can notice the calculated instability is just around the reported CCDW vector (\bm{q}_{\text{CCDW}}=\frac{1}{13}\bm{a}^{*}+\frac{1}{13}\bm{b}^{*}) [26]. For 1_T_-TaTe_{2}, the area of instability is centered near \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}}\approx\frac{1}{3}\bm{a}^{*} [Fig. 3(o)], which is corresponding to the reported (3 × 1) single-\bm{q} CDW-type superlattice [29]. The high coincidence of the calculated and experimentally reported instabilities strongly proves the reliability and accuracy of the phonon calculation. Moreover, different from 1_T_-TaSe_{2}, 1_T_-TaTe_{2} shows a much larger area of instability, which expands to the \Gamma\,K line [see Fig. 3(j)]. That might be the reason why 1_T_-TaSe_{2} only shows the small atomic displacement in the CDW phase, which can be suppressed at high temperatures,  while the single-\bm{q} CDW-type distortion in TaTe_{2} is very stable and the ideal-1T structure has never been observed.

Figures 3(b) and 3(k) show the band structures and Fermi surfaces of 17-TaSe_{2} and 17-TaTe_{2}, respectively. For 17-TaSe_{2}, early calculations show there is only one band crossing Fermi energy (E_{\rm F}), which does not cross E_{\rm F} in the vicinity of the \Gamma point [27, 42]. Moreover, there is a gap (about 0.1 \sim 0.2 eV) below the band crossing E_{\rm F}[27, 42]. However, the recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiment clearly shows a hybridization of bands at \Gamma close to E_{\rm F}, where small hole-type pockets are observed [43]. Obviously, our LDA calculations accurately simulated the band structure of 17-TaSe_{2} [Fig. 3(b)]. Three bands cross E_{\rm F}: The lower two bands [colored in blue and orange in Fig. 3(b)]

  form small cylindrical hole-type pockets close to \Gamma [Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)]. The Fermi surface introduced from the higher band crossing E_{F} [colored in red in Fig. 3(b)] is shown in Fig. 3(e). For 17-TaTe_{2}, one can notice that the band structure and Fermi surfaces [Figs. 3(k)-3(n)] are highly similar to those of 17-TaSe_{2}.

The Fermi-surface nesting can be reflected in generated electron susceptibility [24]. The real part of the electron susceptibility is defined as

\[\chi^{\prime}(\bm{q})=\sum_{\bm{k}}\frac{f(\varepsilon_{\bm{k}})-f(\varepsilon_ {\bm{k+q}})}{\varepsilon_{\bm{k}}-\varepsilon_{\bm{k+q}}},\] (1)

where f(\varepsilon_{\bm{k}}) is the Fermi-Dirac function. The imaginary part is [24]

\[\chi^{\prime\prime}(\bm{q})=\sum_{\bm{k}}\delta(\varepsilon_{\bm{k}}- \varepsilon_{\bm{F}})\delta(\varepsilon_{\bm{k+q}}-\varepsilon_{\bm{F}}).\] (2)

We used a mesh of approximately 40 000 \bm{k} points in the full reciprocal unit cell to calculate the energy eigenvalues derived for the electron susceptibilities. Figures 3(g), 3(h), 3(p), and 3(q) show the cross section of the real part (\chi^{\prime}) and imaginary part (\chi^{\prime}) of the electron susceptibility with \bm{q}_{z}=0 for 17-TaSe_{2} and 17-TaTe_{2}. We found that all of the maxima of \chi and \chi^{\prime} locate between the \Gamma and M points. For 17-TaSe_{2}, both the maxima of \chi^{\prime} and \chi^{\prime} locate at \bm{q}\approx\frac{1}{2}\bm{q}^{*}. The earlier calculation by Myron _et al._[28] showed a peak of \chi^{\prime} at \bm{q}\approx 0.28\bm{q}^{*}, while the recent calculation by Yu _et al._[44] reported a maximum of \chi^{\prime} at \bm{q}\approx 0.295\bm{q}^{*}. Clearly, the maxima of \chi and \chi^{\prime} locate far away from \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}}=\frac{3}{13}\bm{q}^{*}+\frac{1}{13}\bm{b}^{*}. Therefore, Fermi-surface nesting cannot account for the origin of CDWs in 17-TaSe_{2}.

We also calculated the electron-phonon coupling in the \bm{q}_{z}=0 plane for 17-TaSe_{2} and 17-TaTe_{2}. Figures 3(i) and 3(r) show the calculated phonon linewidth \gamma of the lowest

(j)–(r) The bottom panel shows those of 17-TaTe_{2}. The bands crossing E_{F} are colored in (b) and (k). In (f) and (o), the pink solid circles denote the \bm{q} points at which the frequency of the lowest mode is imaginary. The red solid circles and the black arrows in (f) and (o) denote the reported \bm{q}_{\text{CCDW}}=\frac{3}{13}\bm{q}^{*}+\frac{1}{13}\bm{b}^{*} and \bm{q}\approx\frac{1}{3}\bm{q}^{*} for 17-TaSe_{2} and 17-TaTe_{2}, respectively. The high-symmetry K points are shown in (f).

  phonon modes in the \bm{q}_{z}=0 plane. The phonon linewidth \gamma is defined by

\[\gamma_{\bm{q}\nu} = 2\pi\omega_{\bm{q}\nu}\sum_{ij}\int\frac{d^{3}k}{\Omega_{BZ}}|g_{ \bm{q}\nu}(\bm{k},i,j)|^{2}\] (3) \[\times\delta(\varepsilon_{\bm{q},i}-\varepsilon_{F})\delta( \varepsilon_{\bm{k}+\bm{q},j}-\varepsilon_{F}),\]

where the electron-phonon coefficients g_{\bm{q}\nu}(\bm{k},i,j) are defined as

\[g_{\bm{q}\nu}(\bm{k},i,j)=\left(\frac{\hbar}{2M\omega_{\bm{q}\nu}}\right)^{1/2 }\langle\psi_{i,\bm{k}}|\frac{dV_{\text{SCF}}}{d\hat{\bm{u}}_{\bm{q}\nu}}\cdot \hat{\varepsilon}_{\bm{q}\nu}|\psi_{j,\bm{k}+\bm{q}}\rangle,\] (4)

where V_{\text{SCF}} is the Kohn-Sham potential, \hat{u} is the atomic displacement, \hat{\varepsilon} is the phonon eigenvector, and \psi is the related wave function. According to this definition, \gamma, which reflects the electron-phonon coupling contribution, is a quantity that does not depend on the real or imaginary nature of the phonon frequency. Although the calculation with 16\times16\times1 \bm{q} points is not enough to deduce the accurate vector with maximum \gamma, it can still qualitatively reflect the role of electron-phonon coupling. In the instability area, the \gamma of the lowest mode is hundreds of times larger than those of higher modes, proving the connection between electron-phonon coupling and CDWs. For 1_T_-TaSe_{2}, the biggest \gamma (\sim23.11 GHz) is found near the place where \chi' shows the maximum, which is understandable since Fermi-surface nesting can enhance \gamma according to Eqs. (3) and (4). The second largest \gamma (\sim22.18 GHz) is found in the place very near the reported \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}}=\frac{3}{13}\bm{a}^{*}+\frac{1}{13}\bm{b}^{*}. Therefore, if we neglect the enhancement of nesting, one can find that the area of \bm{q} points with large \gamma is centered at the reported \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}}. For 1_T_-TaTe_{2}, the large \gamma area is strongly broadened and expands to \Gamma K, which is coinciding with the phonon instability area shown in Fig. 3. Meanwhile, \chi and \chi" show a small value in the place between \Gamma and K. Therefore, we can conclude that the \bm{q}-dependent electron-phonon coupling-induced PLD, instead of Fermi-surface nesting, is responsible for CDWs in 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x}.

In order to explain the suppression of CDWs upon Te doping, we calculated the simplest hypothetical sample 1_T_-TaSeTe with an ordered stacking of Se/Ta/Te, which is represented as 1_T_-TaSeTe(O). For comparison, we calculated the isostructural 1_T_-TaSe(O), in which the ordered stacking of S/Ta/Se is experimentally demonstrated [33]. Both the phonon dispersions of 1_T_-TaSeTe(O) and 1_T_-TaSeSe(O) show the CDW instability (Fig. 4), which means if the S/Se or Se/Te are orderly distributed, CDW could not be suppressed. Therefore, our observed suppression of CDW is due to the doping-induced disorder. From Table 1, one can notice that the optimized z coordinates of X atoms in pristine 1_T_-TaX_{2} (X = Se, Te) are about \pm0.27. However, for 1_T_-TaSeTe(O), the z coordinates of X atoms change to z_{\text{Se}}=0.249 and z_{\text{Te}}=-0.296, which indicates that the TaX_{6} octahedra are largely distorted. When the Se and Te atoms are randomly mixed, random distortions of TaX_{6} octahedra can be expected in reality, leading to the puckered Ta-Ta layers. This is not compatible with pure two-dimensional PLD. The above scenario can account for the fact that the disorder completely suppresses CDWs in the 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x} system.

We also try to understand the superconductivity near CDWs based on the PLD mechanism. The electron-phonon coupling strength for each mode (\lambda_{\bm{q}\nu}) is defined as

\[\lambda_{\bm{q}\nu}=\frac{\gamma_{\bm{q}\nu}}{\pi\,\hbar N(\varepsilon_{F}) \omega_{\bm{q}\nu}^{2}}.\] (5)

An imaginary frequency \omega of the phonon mode indicates the dynamical instability (in our cases, it indicates the CDW distortion). When the CDW phase is suppressed, the stabilizing of the 1T structure will make the imaginary frequency \omega around \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}} become a small real value [31,32]. The large \gamma and small \omega in Eq. (5) can cause a large electron-phonon coupling constant, leading to the superconductivity. However, it is still hard to understand the part of the superconducting phase locating inside the CDW area of the phase diagram.

### Universal schematic phase diagrams

1_T_-TaS_{2} and 1_T_-TaSe_{2} have the same CCDW ground state, but the CDW transitions in them are different. For 1_T_-TaSe_{2}, just like most TMDs, ICCDW seems to emerge only when CCDW is fully suppressed. On the contrary, in 1_T_-TaS_{2}, when CCDW is suppressed, domain walls instantly emerge and cut the previous long-range CCDW into CCDW domains, leading to the NCCDW state. The CCDW domains gradually shrink, while ICCDW grows in interdomain areas. When the CCDW domains disappear, the system transforms to the ICCDW state. That characteristic makes 1_T_-TaS_{2} very unique among the TMDs with CDWs in a long time [6].

In CCDW states of 1_T_-TaS_{2} and 1_T_-TaSe_{2}, the 5d band of Ta opens a Mott gap, which should prohibit the superconductivity inside the CCDW phase. In the NCCDW state of 1_T_-TaS_{2}, the CCDW domains remain Mott insulating, and superconductivity can only emerge in the metallic interdomain area [8]. In our present 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x}, considering the observed very small superconducting volume inside the CDW phase, one can expect that the domain walls emerge when the CDW phase is suppressed, just like the case demonstrated in 1_T_-TiSe_{2} under pressure [20]. Very recently, the coexistence of CCDW and ICCDW phases was observed during the photoinduced suppression of CDW in 1_T_-TaSe_{2}[45], which supports our concluded scenario. Since domelike superconductivity is usually found in TMDs with CDWs, the domain walls should

Figure 4: Phonon dispersions of 1_T_-TaSeTe(O) and 1_T_-TaSSe(O).

  be universal, although they are hard to reflect in the routine measurements.

Thus we can illustrate the universal natures of CDWs and related superconductivity in some TMDs such as 1_T_-TaS_{2}, 1_T_-TaSe_{2}, and 1_T_-TiSe_{2}. At \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}}, the strong electron-phonon coupling largely softens the phonon modes. Below T_{\text{CDW}}, the phonon energy at \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}} becomes imaginary, meaning there is a new lattice structure. Since the CDW phase originates from the strong \bm{q}-dependent electron-phonon coupling-induced PLD instead of the Fermi-surface nesting, the CDW gap does not need to be opened exactly at E_{\text{F}} when the CDW transition happens. Therefore, there is no reason to have a metal-insulator transition associated with the CDW transition [46].

We drew the schematic phase diagrams to show the tuning process of CDWs in those systems (Fig. 5). The tuning factor such as doping or pressure can harden the phonon mode at \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}}. When the phonon energy at \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}} becomes real, the CDW phase is suppressed. The suppression probably first happens in a small area, leading to the emergence of domain walls. In 1_T_-TaS_{2}, the interdomain areas grow and the domains shrink upon tuning. When the domains disappear, the CDW is fully suppressed [Fig. 5(a)]. For 1_T_-TaSe_{2} and 1_T_-TiSe_{2}, in CDW order, the domain walls are strongly pinned. In that case, the volumes of filamentlike interdomain areas are very small, so that the routine phase diagram [Fig. 2(e)] based on the transport measurements cannot reflect the situation. A more accurate phase diagram obtained by some measurements with high resolution should follow the schematic diagram presented in Fig. 5(b). The mechanism of different pinning of domain walls in 1_T_-TaSe_{2} and other systems needs to be further investigated.

The superconductivity near CDWs is not due to QCP, but to the emergence of domain walls. In the interdomain areas, as the CDW phase is just suppressed, the phonon frequency at \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}} has a small real value, leading to a large total electron-phonon coupling constant. Once the interdomain areas percolated, superconductivity emerges (Fig. 5). When the system is far away from CDWs, the phonon frequency at \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}} become larger, and thus the total electron-phonon coupling constant decreases. Therefore, a domelike superconducting phase can be obtained.

## IV Conclusion

In conclusion, we prepared a series of 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x} (0\leqslant x\leqslant 2) single crystals and summarized an overall electronic phase diagram through the transport measurements. The CDW phase in 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x} (0\leqslant x\leqslant 2) is gradually suppressed by Te doping-induced Se/Te disorder and finally disappears when x>0.5. A domelike superconducting phase with the maximum T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} of 2.5 K is observed near CDWs. The superconducting volume is very small inside the CDW phase and becomes very large instantly when the CDW phase is fully suppressed. Based on the first-principles calculations, we found that the origin of CDWs in the system should be the strong \bm{q}-dependent electron-phonon coupling-induced PLD, instead of Fermi-surface nesting. In this framework, the nature of CDWs and superconductivity can be well understood. The volume variation of superconductivity implies the emergence of domain walls in the suppressing process of CDWs. Our concluded scenario makes a fundamental understanding about CDWs and related superconductivity in TMDs.

# Nature of charge density waves and superconductivity in 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x}

Y. Liu (\lambda)\backslash\ superconductivity with maximum T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset} of 2.5 K was observed near CDW. The superconducting volume is very small inside the CDW phase and becomes very large instantly when the CDW phase is fully suppressed. Our observations can be clearly understood based on the PLD mechanism. The volume variation of superconductivity implies the emergence of domain walls when the CDW phase is suppressed.

## II Experiment and Calculation Details

Single crystals were grown by the chemical vapor transport (CVT) method with iodine as a transport agent. The high-purity elements Ta (4N), Se (4N), and Te (4N) were mixed in chemical stoichiometry, and heated at 900 degC for 4 days in an evacuated quartz tube. The harvested TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x} powders and iodine (5 mg/cm^{3}) were then heated for 15 days in a two-zone furnace, where the temperatures of the source and growth zones were fixed at 950 degC and 850 degC, respectively.

The x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Philips X'pert PRO diffractometer with Cu K_{\alpha} radiation (\lambda = 1.5418 A). Structural refinements were performed by using the Rietveld method with the x'pert highscore plus software. Electron diffraction and high-angle annular dark-field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) experiments were performed in the JEOL ARM200F equipped with double aberration correctors and a cold field emission gun operated at 200 kV. For the STEM images, the convergence angle is 28 mrad and the collection angle of the HAADF detector is between 90 and 370 mrad. Under this condition, the spatial resolution is about 0.08 nm. The resistivity was measured by the standard four-probe ac technique using the Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). Measurement of the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility and the isothermal hysteresis loop were carried out in the Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS) equipped with a ^{3}He cryostat.

At low temperatures, Ta atoms displace to make “star of David” clusters, leading to 13.9′ rotated \sqrt{13}\times\sqrt{13} CCDWs with \theta_{\rm CCDW}=\frac{3}{2}\sigma^{\rm{z}}+\frac{1}{13}\bm{b}^{\ast}[6]. (c) Top view of the Ta plane in TaTe_{2}. The monoclinic distorted-1T structure of TaTe_{2} can be seen as a 3×1 single-_σ_ CDW-type distorted structure of hypothetical 1_T_-TaTe_{2}[6,29,30].

  The first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were carried out using the quantum espresso package [34] with ultrasoft pseudopotentials. The exchange-correlation interaction was treated with the local density approximation (LDA) according to Perdew and Zunger [35]. The energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set was 35 Ry. Brillouin-zone sampling is performed on the Monkhorst-Pack (MP) mesh [36] of 32 x 32 x 8. The Vanderbilt-Marzari Fermi smearing method with a smearing parameter of \sigma=0.02 Ry was used for the calculations of the total energy and electron charge density. Phonon dispersions were calculated using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) [37] with an 8 x 8 x 4 mesh of \bm{q} points. In order to investigate the distribution of CDW instability around the \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}}, 16 x 16 x 1 \bm{q} points were used. Denser 64 x 64 x 8 \bm{k} points are used for electron-phonon coupling.

## III Results and Discussion

### Superconducting dome near CDWs

The x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x} (_x_ = 0, 1, and 2) single crystals are shown in Fig. 1(d), in which only (00l) reflections were observed, suggesting the c axis is perpendicular to the surface of the crystal. With increasing x, the diffraction peaks distinctly shift to lower angles, reflecting the crystal expansion induced by Te doping. Figure 1(e) shows the powder XRD patterns and the structural refinement results of Rietveld analysis for the selected samples with x = 0, 1, and 2. Figure 1(f) shows the enlargement of the (011) peak for x = 1, 1.5, and 2. The undistorted CdI_{2}-type 1T structure for x = 1 leads to a single (011) peak, while there are double peaks resulting from the monoclinic distorted-1T structure for x = 2. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the (011) peak starts to split when x = 1.5, indicating the emergence of a distorted-1T structure, i.e., the critical point between the 1_T_-structure and monoclinic structure is close to x = 1.5. The evolution of the lattice parameters (_a_, _c_) and unit-cell volume (_V_) of 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x} is depicted in Fig. 1(g). Indeed, the values of a, c, and V monotonously increase with x, in accordance with the larger ion radius of Te than that of Se.

Figures 1(h) and 1(i) demonstrate two typical diffraction patterns taken along the [001] zone-axis direction of 1_T_-TaSe_{2} and 1_T_-TaSeTe, respectively. The superstructure reflections corresponding to the commensurate phase with \bm{q}_{\text{CCDW}}=\frac{3}{13}\bm{a}^{*}+\frac{1}{13}\bm{b}^{*} can be clearly observed in Fig. 1(h), which is evidently different from the diffuse superlattice spots with the incommensurated in-plane \bm{q} vector in 1_T_-TaSeTe [Fig. 1(i)]. A similar result was previously reported by Luo _et al._[38] and a possible chemical-origin, short-range Se/Te ordering was proposed. However, the detailed analysis based on the HAADF-STEM images seen from both [001] [Fig. 1(j)] and [100] [Fig. 1(k)] zone-axis directions suggests the disordered Se/Te distribution in the 1_T_-TaSeTe, which is significantly different from the ordered S/Se distribution in 1_T_-TaSSe [33].

Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the temperature dependence of the in-plane resistivity ratio (\rho/\rho_{250\,\text{K}}) of 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x} single crystals. The Te doping largely decreases the residual resistivity ratio (RRR = \rho_{300\,\text{K}}/\rho_{3\,\text{K}}). For 1_T_-TaSe_{2}, RRR = 17.4. For 1_T_-TaSeTe, RRR = 0.85, reflecting the substantial doping-induced disorder, which is corresponding to our HAADF-STEM observation. The signature of superconductivity emerges as x >= 0.3, and finally disappears for x >= 1.3, while the zero resistances are observed when 0.5 < x < 1.3 [Fig. 2(a)]. The maximum of superconducting onset temperature (T_{c}^{\text{onset}}) of 2.5 K and the maximum of zero-resistance temperature (T_{c}^{\text{zero}}) of 1.6 K are found when the CDW phase is completely suppressed (_x_ = 0.6). Figures 2(c) and 2(d) show the magnetic properties with both the zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) modes of 1_T_-TaSe_{1.4}Te_{0.6} (optimal sample) and 1_T_-TaSe_{1.5}Te_{0.5} at H = 10 Oe with the magnetic field parallel to the c axis, respectively. The results indicate very small superconducting volume (4p _kh_ = 2.7 x 10-3 at 0.5 K in ZFC) in 1_T_-TaSe_{1.5}Te_{0.5} (in which the CDW phase still exists) and large superconducting volume (4p _kh_ = 0.35 at 0.5 K in ZFC) in 1_T_-TaSe_{1.4}Te_{0.6} (in which the CDW phase is just completely suppressed). The inset of Fig. 2(c) shows the magnetization hysteresis loop _M_(_H_) obtained at T = 0.5 K, indicating it is a typical type-II superconductor. Figure 2(e) summarizes the overall phase diagram in 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x}. The domelike superconducting phase is near the CDW phase, which is similar to that in 1_T_-TaS_{2-x}Se_{x}[14]. In the phase diagram, the CDW phase is gradually suppressed by Te doping and disappears as x > 0.5, which is quite different from the situation in 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Se_{x}[14]. With higher Te content x > 1.5, the crystal structure gradually distorts to a monoclinic one with the C2/_m_ space group, which could also be considered as a single-\bm{q} CDW-type distortion [6,30].

### Mechanisms of CDWs and superconductivity

The low-symmetry CDW structure is usually considered as the high-symmetry phase with distortion introduced by some instability. Since our prepared 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x} samples for x < 1.5 are all in the pure 1T phase according to the structure characterization, we performed the first-principles calculations using the 1T structure to explain our observation (Fig. 3). We first calculated the two end members of 1_T_-TaSe_{2} and hypothetical 1_T_-TaTe_{2}, respectively. The fully optimized structural parameters, listed in Table I, are close to those from the previous LDA calculation [32]. The underestimation of lattice parameters is expected for LDA [32].

Previous research has shown that the phonon calculation is an effective method to simulate the CDW instability [29, 30, 31, 32, 39, 40, 41]. Figures 3(a) and 3(j) show the phonon dispersions of 1_T_-TaSe_{2} and 1_T_-TaTe_{2}. For 1_T_-TaSe_{2}, the calculation is in good agreement with the previous calculation by Ge _et al._[32]. From Fig. 3(f), one can notice the calculated instability is just around the reported CCDW vector (\bm{q}_{\text{CCDW}}=\frac{1}{13}\bm{a}^{*}+\frac{1}{13}\bm{b}^{*}) [26]. For 1_T_-TaTe_{2}, the area of instability is centered near \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}}\approx\frac{1}{3}\bm{a}^{*} [Fig. 3(o)], which is corresponding to the reported (3 × 1) single-\bm{q} CDW-type superlattice [29]. The high coincidence of the calculated and experimentally reported instabilities strongly proves the reliability and accuracy of the phonon calculation. Moreover, different from 1_T_-TaSe_{2}, 1_T_-TaTe_{2} shows a much larger area of instability, which expands to the \Gamma\,K line [see Fig. 3(j)]. That might be the reason why 1_T_-TaSe_{2} only shows the small atomic displacement in the CDW phase, which can be suppressed at high temperatures,  while the single-\bm{q} CDW-type distortion in TaTe_{2} is very stable and the ideal-1T structure has never been observed.

Figures 3(b) and 3(k) show the band structures and Fermi surfaces of 17-TaSe_{2} and 17-TaTe_{2}, respectively. For 17-TaSe_{2}, early calculations show there is only one band crossing Fermi energy (E_{\rm F}), which does not cross E_{\rm F} in the vicinity of the \Gamma point [27, 42]. Moreover, there is a gap (about 0.1 \sim 0.2 eV) below the band crossing E_{\rm F}[27, 42]. However, the recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiment clearly shows a hybridization of bands at \Gamma close to E_{\rm F}, where small hole-type pockets are observed [43]. Obviously, our LDA calculations accurately simulated the band structure of 17-TaSe_{2} [Fig. 3(b)]. Three bands cross E_{\rm F}: The lower two bands [colored in blue and orange in Fig. 3(b)]

Figure 2: Temperature dependence of in-plane resistivity ratio (\rho/\rho_{250\rm K}) of 17-TaSe_{2-\gamma}Te_{x} (a) below T = 250 K and (b) above T = 250 K.

  form small cylindrical hole-type pockets close to \Gamma [Figs. 3(c) and 3(d)]. The Fermi surface introduced from the higher band crossing E_{F} [colored in red in Fig. 3(b)] is shown in Fig. 3(e). For 17-TaTe_{2}, one can notice that the band structure and Fermi surfaces [Figs. 3(k)-3(n)] are highly similar to those of 17-TaSe_{2}.

The Fermi-surface nesting can be reflected in generated electron susceptibility [24]. The real part of the electron susceptibility is defined as

\[\chi^{\prime}(\bm{q})=\sum_{\bm{k}}\frac{f(\varepsilon_{\bm{k}})-f(\varepsilon_ {\bm{k+q}})}{\varepsilon_{\bm{k}}-\varepsilon_{\bm{k+q}}},\] (1)

where f(\varepsilon_{\bm{k}}) is the Fermi-Dirac function. The imaginary part is [24]

\[\chi^{\prime\prime}(\bm{q})=\sum_{\bm{k}}\delta(\varepsilon_{\bm{k}}- \varepsilon_{\bm{F}})\delta(\varepsilon_{\bm{k+q}}-\varepsilon_{\bm{F}}).\] (2)

We used a mesh of approximately 40 000 \bm{k} points in the full reciprocal unit cell to calculate the energy eigenvalues derived for the electron susceptibilities. Figures 3(g), 3(h), 3(p), and 3(q) show the cross section of the real part (\chi^{\prime}) and imaginary part (\chi^{\prime}) of the electron susceptibility with \bm{q}_{z}=0 for 17-TaSe_{2} and 17-TaTe_{2}. We found that all of the maxima of \chi and \chi^{\prime} locate between the \Gamma and M points. For 17-TaSe_{2}, both the maxima of \chi^{\prime} and \chi^{\prime} locate at \bm{q}\approx\frac{1}{2}\bm{q}^{*}. The earlier calculation by Myron _et al._[28] showed a peak of \chi^{\prime} at \bm{q}\approx 0.28\bm{q}^{*}, while the recent calculation by Yu _et al._[44] reported a maximum of \chi^{\prime} at \bm{q}\approx 0.295\bm{q}^{*}. Clearly, the maxima of \chi and \chi^{\prime} locate far away from \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}}=\frac{3}{13}\bm{q}^{*}+\frac{1}{13}\bm{b}^{*}. Therefore, Fermi-surface nesting cannot account for the origin of CDWs in 17-TaSe_{2}.

We also calculated the electron-phonon coupling in the \bm{q}_{z}=0 plane for 17-TaSe_{2} and 17-TaTe_{2}. Figures 3(i) and 3(r) show the calculated phonon linewidth \gamma of the lowest

The top panel shows the (a) phonon dispersions, (b) band dispersions, (c)–(e) Fermi surfaces, (f) distribution of instability in the \bm{q}_{z}=0 plane, cross section of (g) real and (h) imaginary parts of the generated electron susceptibility with \bm{q}_{z}=0, and (i) contour map of the phonon linewidth \gamma of the lowest phonon modes in the \bm{q}_{z}=0 of 17-TaSe_{2}. (j)–(r) The bottom panel shows those of 17-TaTe_{2}. The bands crossing E_{F} are colored in (b) and (k). In (f) and (o), the pink solid circles denote the \bm{q} points at which the frequency of the lowest mode is imaginary. The red solid circles and the black arrows in (f) and (o) denote the reported \bm{q}_{\text{CCDW}}=\frac{3}{13}\bm{q}^{*}+\frac{1}{13}\bm{b}^{*} and \bm{q}\approx\frac{1}{3}\bm{q}^{*} for 17-TaSe_{2} and 17-TaTe_{2}, respectively. The high-symmetry K points are shown in (f).

  phonon modes in the \bm{q}_{z}=0 plane. The phonon linewidth \gamma is defined by

\[\gamma_{\bm{q}\nu} = 2\pi\omega_{\bm{q}\nu}\sum_{ij}\int\frac{d^{3}k}{\Omega_{BZ}}|g_{ \bm{q}\nu}(\bm{k},i,j)|^{2}\] (3) \[\times\delta(\varepsilon_{\bm{q},i}-\varepsilon_{F})\delta( \varepsilon_{\bm{k}+\bm{q},j}-\varepsilon_{F}),\]

where the electron-phonon coefficients g_{\bm{q}\nu}(\bm{k},i,j) are defined as

\[g_{\bm{q}\nu}(\bm{k},i,j)=\left(\frac{\hbar}{2M\omega_{\bm{q}\nu}}\right)^{1/2 }\langle\psi_{i,\bm{k}}|\frac{dV_{\text{SCF}}}{d\hat{\bm{u}}_{\bm{q}\nu}}\cdot \hat{\varepsilon}_{\bm{q}\nu}|\psi_{j,\bm{k}+\bm{q}}\rangle,\] (4)

where V_{\text{SCF}} is the Kohn-Sham potential, \hat{u} is the atomic displacement, \hat{\varepsilon} is the phonon eigenvector, and \psi is the related wave function. According to this definition, \gamma, which reflects the electron-phonon coupling contribution, is a quantity that does not depend on the real or imaginary nature of the phonon frequency. Although the calculation with 16\times16\times1 \bm{q} points is not enough to deduce the accurate vector with maximum \gamma, it can still qualitatively reflect the role of electron-phonon coupling. In the instability area, the \gamma of the lowest mode is hundreds of times larger than those of higher modes, proving the connection between electron-phonon coupling and CDWs. For 1_T_-TaSe_{2}, the biggest \gamma (\sim23.11 GHz) is found near the place where \chi' shows the maximum, which is understandable since Fermi-surface nesting can enhance \gamma according to Eqs. (3) and (4). The second largest \gamma (\sim22.18 GHz) is found in the place very near the reported \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}}=\frac{3}{13}\bm{a}^{*}+\frac{1}{13}\bm{b}^{*}. Therefore, if we neglect the enhancement of nesting, one can find that the area of \bm{q} points with large \gamma is centered at the reported \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}}. For 1_T_-TaTe_{2}, the large \gamma area is strongly broadened and expands to \Gamma K, which is coinciding with the phonon instability area shown in Fig. 3. Meanwhile, \chi and \chi" show a small value in the place between \Gamma and K. Therefore, we can conclude that the \bm{q}-dependent electron-phonon coupling-induced PLD, instead of Fermi-surface nesting, is responsible for CDWs in 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x}.

In order to explain the suppression of CDWs upon Te doping, we calculated the simplest hypothetical sample 1_T_-TaSeTe with an ordered stacking of Se/Ta/Te, which is represented as 1_T_-TaSeTe(O). For comparison, we calculated the isostructural 1_T_-TaSe(O), in which the ordered stacking of S/Ta/Se is experimentally demonstrated [33]. Both the phonon dispersions of 1_T_-TaSeTe(O) and 1_T_-TaSeSe(O) show the CDW instability (Fig. 4), which means if the S/Se or Se/Te are orderly distributed, CDW could not be suppressed. Therefore, our observed suppression of CDW is due to the doping-induced disorder. From Table 1, one can notice that the optimized z coordinates of X atoms in pristine 1_T_-TaX_{2} (X = Se, Te) are about \pm0.27. However, for 1_T_-TaSeTe(O), the z coordinates of X atoms change to z_{\text{Se}}=0.249 and z_{\text{Te}}=-0.296, which indicates that the TaX_{6} octahedra are largely distorted. When the Se and Te atoms are randomly mixed, random distortions of TaX_{6} octahedra can be expected in reality, leading to the puckered Ta-Ta layers. This is not compatible with pure two-dimensional PLD. The above scenario can account for the fact that the disorder completely suppresses CDWs in the 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x} system.

We also try to understand the superconductivity near CDWs based on the PLD mechanism. The electron-phonon coupling strength for each mode (\lambda_{\bm{q}\nu}) is defined as

\[\lambda_{\bm{q}\nu}=\frac{\gamma_{\bm{q}\nu}}{\pi\,\hbar N(\varepsilon_{F}) \omega_{\bm{q}\nu}^{2}}.\] (5)

An imaginary frequency \omega of the phonon mode indicates the dynamical instability (in our cases, it indicates the CDW distortion). When the CDW phase is suppressed, the stabilizing of the 1T structure will make the imaginary frequency \omega around \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}} become a small real value [31,32]. The large \gamma and small \omega in Eq. (5) can cause a large electron-phonon coupling constant, leading to the superconductivity. However, it is still hard to understand the part of the superconducting phase locating inside the CDW area of the phase diagram.

### Universal schematic phase diagrams

1_T_-TaS_{2} and 1_T_-TaSe_{2} have the same CCDW ground state, but the CDW transitions in them are different. For 1_T_-TaSe_{2}, just like most TMDs, ICCDW seems to emerge only when CCDW is fully suppressed. On the contrary, in 1_T_-TaS_{2}, when CCDW is suppressed, domain walls instantly emerge and cut the previous long-range CCDW into CCDW domains, leading to the NCCDW state. The CCDW domains gradually shrink, while ICCDW grows in interdomain areas. When the CCDW domains disappear, the system transforms to the ICCDW state. That characteristic makes 1_T_-TaS_{2} very unique among the TMDs with CDWs in a long time [6].

In CCDW states of 1_T_-TaS_{2} and 1_T_-TaSe_{2}, the 5d band of Ta opens a Mott gap, which should prohibit the superconductivity inside the CCDW phase. In the NCCDW state of 1_T_-TaS_{2}, the CCDW domains remain Mott insulating, and superconductivity can only emerge in the metallic interdomain area [8]. In our present 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x}, considering the observed very small superconducting volume inside the CDW phase, one can expect that the domain walls emerge when the CDW phase is suppressed, just like the case demonstrated in 1_T_-TiSe_{2} under pressure [20]. Very recently, the coexistence of CCDW and ICCDW phases was observed during the photoinduced suppression of CDW in 1_T_-TaSe_{2}[45], which supports our concluded scenario. Since domelike superconductivity is usually found in TMDs with CDWs, the domain walls should

  be universal, although they are hard to reflect in the routine measurements.

Thus we can illustrate the universal natures of CDWs and related superconductivity in some TMDs such as 1_T_-TaS_{2}, 1_T_-TaSe_{2}, and 1_T_-TiSe_{2}. At \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}}, the strong electron-phonon coupling largely softens the phonon modes. Below T_{\text{CDW}}, the phonon energy at \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}} becomes imaginary, meaning there is a new lattice structure. Since the CDW phase originates from the strong \bm{q}-dependent electron-phonon coupling-induced PLD instead of the Fermi-surface nesting, the CDW gap does not need to be opened exactly at E_{\text{F}} when the CDW transition happens. Therefore, there is no reason to have a metal-insulator transition associated with the CDW transition [46].

We drew the schematic phase diagrams to show the tuning process of CDWs in those systems (Fig. 5). The tuning factor such as doping or pressure can harden the phonon mode at \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}}. When the phonon energy at \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}} becomes real, the CDW phase is suppressed. The suppression probably first happens in a small area, leading to the emergence of domain walls. In 1_T_-TaS_{2}, the interdomain areas grow and the domains shrink upon tuning. When the domains disappear, the CDW is fully suppressed [Fig. 5(a)]. For 1_T_-TaSe_{2} and 1_T_-TiSe_{2}, in CDW order, the domain walls are strongly pinned. In that case, the volumes of filamentlike interdomain areas are very small, so that the routine phase diagram [Fig. 2(e)] based on the transport measurements cannot reflect the situation. A more accurate phase diagram obtained by some measurements with high resolution should follow the schematic diagram presented in Fig. 5(b). The mechanism of different pinning of domain walls in 1_T_-TaSe_{2} and other systems needs to be further investigated.

The superconductivity near CDWs is not due to QCP, but to the emergence of domain walls. In the interdomain areas, as the CDW phase is just suppressed, the phonon frequency at \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}} has a small real value, leading to a large total electron-phonon coupling constant. Once the interdomain areas percolated, superconductivity emerges (Fig. 5). When the system is far away from CDWs, the phonon frequency at \bm{q}_{\text{CDW}} become larger, and thus the total electron-phonon coupling constant decreases. Therefore, a domelike superconducting phase can be obtained.

## IV Conclusion

In conclusion, we prepared a series of 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x} (0\leqslant x\leqslant 2) single crystals and summarized an overall electronic phase diagram through the transport measurements. The CDW phase in 1_T_-TaSe_{2-x}Te_{x} (0\leqslant x\leqslant 2) is gradually suppressed by Te doping-induced Se/Te disorder and finally disappears when x>0.5. A domelike superconducting phase with the maximum T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}} of 2.5 K is observed near CDWs. The superconducting volume is very small inside the CDW phase and becomes very large instantly when the CDW phase is fully suppressed. Based on the first-principles calculations, we found that the origin of CDWs in the system should be the strong \bm{q}-dependent electron-phonon coupling-induced PLD, instead of Fermi-surface nesting. In this framework, the nature of CDWs and superconductivity can be well understood. The volume variation of superconductivity implies the emergence of domain walls in the suppressing process of CDWs. Our concluded scenario makes a fundamental understanding about CDWs and related superconductivity in TMDs.
