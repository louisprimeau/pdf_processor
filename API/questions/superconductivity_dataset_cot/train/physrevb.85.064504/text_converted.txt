###### Abstract

The as-grown single crystal Fe_(1.08)Te_(0.55)Se_(0.45) with the
tetragonal PbO-type structure is nonsuperconducting owing to the excess
Fe. Superconductivity is induced after oxygen annealing with an onset
and zero resistance transition temperature around 14.5 K and 11.5 K,
respectively. The oxygen doping is evidenced by electron energy loss
spectroscopy and accompanied by improved homogeneity in the remaining
PbO-type phase, as well as an increase in the L₃/L₂ intensity ratio of
the Fe-L² ⁻ ³ edge, indicating an increase in Fe valence. Local phase
transformation from the tetragonal PbO-type phase to the hexagonal
NiAs-type phase is also observed after oxygen annealing.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x)[1] has
attracted significant interest in iron-based superconductors. The family
of FeTe_(1 − x)Se_(x) materials, which are composed of only Fe(Se/Te)
layers, received special attraction due to its simple crystal structure.
It has been found that isovalent substitution of Te with Se in the
parent compound FeTe induces superconductivity in FeTe_(1 − x)Se_(x),[2]
reaching T_(c) ∼ 15 K at the optimized doping of 50

Here, we report a structural investigation of oxygen-annealed
nonsuperconducting single crystal Fe_(1.08)Te_(0.55)Se_(0.45) with the
PbO-type structure. The Fe_(1.08)Te_(0.55)Se_(0.45) was selected for
study because FeTe_(0.55)Se_(0.45) without the excess Fe is an optimum
doped superconductor, and the study of oxidation in samples with
superconductivity suppressed by the excess Fe gives insight to the roles
of both oxygen and the excess Fe. The use of bulk single crystals also
eliminates the effect of substrate and its strain in thin films. For
Fe_(1.08)Te_(0.55)Se_(0.45), the crystal exhibits superconductivity
after being annealed in oxygen atmosphere. Dark field (DF) images in
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-angle annual dark-field
(HAADF) images in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)
demonstrate that the hexagonal NiAs-type phases of Fe(Te/Se) are formed
in local areas. STEM-HAADF imaging shows that the sample homogeneity is
also improved in the remaining PbO-type phase after oxygen annealing.
Oxygen was detected by using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS);
the fine structure of the O-K edge shows a prepeak resulting from p-d
hybridization of O 2p and Fe 3d valence states. The average L₃/L₂
intensity ratio of the Fe-L_(2, 3) edge increases from 5.27 in the
as-grown sample to 5.85 in the oxygen-annealed sample, indicating an
increase in the Fe valence towards 3+.

## II Experiment

Single crystals of Fe_(1.08)Te_(0.55)Se_(0.45) were grown by a
unidirectional solidification method and under a slow cool down
procedure.[11] High resolution synchrotron powder diffraction data were
collected at room temperature using beam-line 11-BM with an incident
x-ray beam of 0.4134 A wavelength at the Advanced Photon Source (APS),
Argonne National Laboratory, STEM and EELS were performed using the
JEOL2200FS, while electron nanodiffraction was carried using JEOL2010F.
Both microscopes are installed at the University of Illinois. The
JEOL2200FS is equipped with a CEOS probe corrector and an in-column
Ω-energy filter, which is used for EELS. Both microscopes were operated
at 200 kV. The TEM samples were prepared using the procedure reported in
Ref. [12].

## III Results and Discussion

The as-grown sample of Fe_(1.08)Te_(0.55)Se_(0.45) was annealed at 120
degC in 500 mTorr O₂ atmosphere for 90 minutes. The overall measured
composition of the sample, Fe_(1.10)Te_(0.54)Se_(0.46), as detected by
inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectroscopy, remains the same
before and after annealing. The amount of excess Fe detected by ICP is
slightly higher than the nominal composition, and the concentration of
Te and Se varies a little. Synchrotron powder diffractions of as-grown
and annealed samples revealed very little change in the crystal lattice
constants. Changes in the powder diffraction intensity were observed, as
shown in Fig. 1. Refinement of the powder diffraction data suggests that
the excess Fe move away from the Fe-Te(Se) layer after annealing, but
the result is not conclusive. A large increase in the peak width of
reflection (110) was also observed after annealing. The four-probe
resistivity measurements were performed on the as-grown and oxygen
annealed samples, respectively. The temperature dependence of
resistivity for the as-grown sample is shown as the dashed curve in the
Fig. 2. No zero resistivity was observed, but trace of superconductivity
is suggested by the large drop in resistivity. The temperature
dependence of the resistivity for the oxygen annealed sample is plotted
as the solid curve in the Fig. 2, which demonstrates superconducting
transition around 14.5 K and zero resistivity around 11.5 K. The inset
of Fig. 2 shows the enlargement of the resistivity-temperature curves.

We noticed that exposure to air at room temperature also makes the
as-grown sample superconducting, although both the T_(c) is not as high
as, and the transition width is not as sharp as, that after oxygen
annealing. For the as-grown sample, we cleaved and took a piece from the
middle of a thick crystal to ensure that it did not expose to air
directly. The edges of the cleaved sample were also cut off to minimize
oxidization effect for the R(T) curve measurement. The drop in
resistance observed in the as-grown sample, nonetheless in some part,
could be still due to the residual diffused in oxygen. We also annealed
the as-grown sample in vacuum at 140 degC for 180 minutes, and no
significant change in the R(T) curve was seen, which indicates oxygen
plays an important role in improvement of superconductivity.

TEM samples with uniform thickness in a relative large area (∼100 nm)
were prepared from the as-grown crystals using a tape method described
elsewhere.[12] The above oxygen annealing procedure was carried out for
the TEM sample. Figure 3(a) shows an electron diffraction pattern along
the [001] zone axis of the oxygen-annealed Fe_(1.08)Te_(0.55)Se_(0.45)
sample, recorded on the Fuji image plate by using JEOL 2010F (JEOL,
USA). In addition to the reflections arranged in the square pattern
belonging to the tetragonal PbO-type phase (P4/nmm), extra reflections
appear in the diffraction pattern. The reflection (200) of the
tetragonal phase is labeled with a subscript T as (200). Some of these
additional reflections are identified as two sets of diffraction
patterns of the hexagonal NiAs-type Fe(Te/Se) phase (P63/mmc) along
[001] direction, with difference in orientation by 30^(∘). The
reflections (100), (010), and (110) of the hexagonal phase are labeled
with a subscript of H.a and H.b for these two sets of diffraction
patterns, respectively. The inset in Fig. 3(a) shows the enlarged

Fe_(1.08)Te_(0.55)Se_(0.43) along [001] direction, demonstrating mixed
phases. Reflections of the tetragonal PbO-type phase are labeled with
subscript T. Two sets of diffraction patterns of the hexagonal NiAs-type
phase are indexed with subscript H.a and H.b, respectively. The inset
shows the enlarged pattern from the boxed region. Two DF images, formed
from the reflections of (110)_(h, a) and (110)_(h, b), are shown in (b)
and (c), respectively, which show the needle-like contrast aligning with
a and b axis of the tetragonal phase, respectively. A combined DF image
by adding (b) and (c) is shown in (d) showing the meshlike contrast.

annealing.

pattern from the boxed region. For the tetragonal PbO-type phase,
reflections h + k = odd are seen [reflection (100)T is labeled]. These
reflections are expected to be extinct in the terminal phases of FeSe
and FeTe with the tetragonal symmetry of P4/_mm_ or when Se and Te are
randomly mixed. In the as-grown sample, those reflections were also
noticed, which was interpreted by a small separation in the occupancy,
or preference, of the two Te/Se sites inside the tetragonal unit cell by
Se and Te atoms, respectively, leading to a net scattering for the h + k
= odd reflections. In the insert of Fig. 3(a) there are two other broad
reflections that are not identified yet.

Two DF images, shown in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c), were formed by selecting
the reflections of (110)h,a and (110)h,b in Fig. 3(a), respectively. The
contrast in the DF images has the appearance of being needlelike, which
aligns with a and b axis of the tetragonal phase, respectively,
indicating that the hexagonal phases are coherent with the tetragonal
phase. Figure 3(d) demonstrates a combined DF image by adding Figs. 3(b)
and 3(c) together, showing a meshlike contrast. Based on the powder
diffraction file (PDF) database, lattice constant a of tetragonal and
hexagonal phases are close with a mismatch of at most about 3

The STEM and EELS experiments were performed on a JEOL 2200FS (JEOL,
USA) microscope equipped with a CEOS spherical aberration corrector
(CEOS GmbH). The microscope was operated at 200 keV.[13] Figure 4(a)
shows a HAADF image at low magnification. The image shows the similar
meshlike contrast, as seen in Fig. 3(d), which suggests the hexagonal
phases mainly exist in the brighter regions in the HAADF image. In STEM,
incoherently scattered intensities, collected by the HAADF detector with
a large inner-cutoff angle, are proportional to thickness and power of
atomic numbers. The tetragonal phase has 22 Te/Se atoms per nm[3], while
there are 28 Te/Se atoms per nm[3] in the hexagonal phase. The density
difference explains the contrast seen in the HAADF image. Low-loss EELS
analysis shows that the plasmon loss in the hexagonal phases shifts to
higher energy by about 0.7 eV compared to the remaining tetragonal
phase, which suggests the difference in the density of free carriers in
the two phases. Figure 4(b) shows an enlarged HAADF image, which
exhibits no contrast of spinodal decomposition that was observed in the
as-grown sample [see Fig. 3(c)].[12] Similar phase separation in the
as-grown FeTe0.55Se0.45 was also reported by X. He _et al._ via scanning
tunneling microscopy.[14] Although the image intensity variation in the
oxygen-annealed sample was still observable, the extent of the variation
is much smaller than that in the as-grown sample. This observation
indicates sample homogeneity was improved after oxygen annealing in the
tetragonal phase.

The hexagonal NiAs-type FeSe phase was often detected as impurity in the
tetragonal PbO-type FeSe superconductor.[5, 15, 16, 17] It has been
reported that this tetragonal phase slowly converts to the hexagonal
phase below 300 degC.[5] The hexagonal NiAs-type FeTe phase, normally
with Fe deficiency, has also been reported.[18] However, we found no
evidence of hexagonal phases in as-grown Fe1+YFe1-xSe2 single
crystals.[12] Thus, the observed hexagonal phase is the result of oxygen
annealing. Neither hexagonal NiAs-type FeSe or FeTe phase exhibits
superconductivity.[5, 19] This structure consists of Fe in a hexagonal
lattice with Se/Te atoms occupying the alternating sites of the Fe
lattice. The structure lacks the two-dimensional FeSe/Te layer
structure, which is believed to be the active layer that is critical in
iron-based superconductors.

In what follows, we focus on the STEM-EELS characterization of the
superconducting tetragonal phase. Figure 5(a) shows a typical EELS
spectrum with O-K, Te-M4,5, and Fe-L2,3 edges labeled. The
background-subtracted experimental O-K edge is shown in Fig. 5(b) by
open symbols; the solid curve, obtained by smoothing the experimental
data, is for the guidance of eyes, which demonstrates three peaks
labeled (a)-(c). The prepeak (a) around 530 eV indicates hybridizing of
Fe 3d and oxygen 2p orbitals.[20] C. Colliex _et al._ systematically
investigated O-K edges in FeO, Fe3O4, _a_-Fe2O3, and _y_-Fe2O3.[20] They
demonstrated that both Fe3O4 and _y_-Fe2O3 show a small distinct peak in
between (b) and (c), which is absent in the fine structure of the O-K
edge we observed. The prepeak (a) we observed, thus, appears as a
mixture of the prepeaks in FeO and _a_-Fe2O3 in terms of the relative
prepeak intensity. The fine structure of O-K edges in FeO and _a_-Fe2O3
are reproduced from Ref. [20] and plotted in Fig. 5(c) for comparison.
Next, the fine structure of the Fe-L2,3 edge was analyzed. In the
as-grown sample, our previous work shows that the L3/L2 intensity ratio
fluctuates between 4.3 and 5.8 observed in Te-rich and Te-poor phases,
respectively.[12] The averaged L3/L2 intensity ratio of the as-grown
sample measured here was calculated by averaging spectra acquired at
different sample positions and was found to be 5.27 ± 0.09. The details
of the calculation method for the L3/L2 intensity ratio were reported
elsewhere.[12] A separate EELS experiment for the as-grown sample in the
TEM mode did

not detect oxygen in the thicker sample regions, while very small
amounts of oxygen signals were seen in the thinner sample regions,
indicating oxygen only diffuses into surface layers in as-grown samples.
For the annealed sample, the same procedure gives 5.85 ± 0.14 for the
L₃/L₂ intensity ratio of the Fe-L_(2, 3) edge in the superconducting,
tetragonal phase, which represents an increase of 0.58 over the as-grown
sample.

Improvement of bulk superconductivity has been previously reported in
the Fe_(1 + y)Te_(1 − x)Se_(x) with smaller amount of excess Fe after
annealing in air at 270 ^(∘)C; the improvement was attributed to partial
removal of excess Fe.[6] In our study the as-grown single crystal of
Fe_(1.08)Te_(0.55)Se_(0.45) with large amount of excess Fe exhibits no
superconductivity due to excess Fe but becomes superconducting after
annealed in oxygen atmosphere at low temperatures. Analysis revealed no
overall change in sample composition. Fe deficiency is often found in
the hexagonal NiAs-type FeSe[21] and FeTe,[18] respectively, which
suggests that the excess Fe likely to remain in the tetragonal phase if
not removed. The role of oxygen annealing has been studied
theoretically. Y. Nie _et al._ performed the density functional
calculations with the projector augmented wave method as implemented in
VASP code.[10, 22] A 2 × 2 × 1 supercell of FeTe was built with
interstitial oxygen partially located at symmetric sites of Te. The
projected density of state was calculated for a different number of
interstitial oxygen varying from 1 to 4 in the supercell corresponding
to FeTeO_(x) with x = 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, and 0.5. They found that Fe d
states and O p states have the strongest hybridization in FeTeO_(0.5)
corresponding to nominal Fe valence of 3+, and the Fermi surface is also
strongly affected. The density functional calculation performed by L.
Zhang _et al._ shows that the excess Fe is strongly magnetic and acts as
an electron donor to the Fe layers,[23] which is responsible for the
suppression of superconductivity and induction of weakly localized
electronic states.[24] C. Dong _et al.[6]_ suggested that excess Fe
could be partially removed as implied by energy-dispersive x-ray
spectroscopy as well as color change from black to red-brown, indicating
the existence of iron oxide. However, we did not see evidences of iron
oxide. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images in Fig. 6 also show largely
smooth surface in our as-grown and oxygen-annealed samples, except spots
separated by hundreds of nm in distances. Density of such white spots
increased slightly after oxygen annealing.

The Fe valence can be measured experimentally as previous systematic
investigations of the L_(2, 3) edges of 3d transition-metal oxides,
which reveals a strong correlation between the L₃/L₂ intensity ratio and
the d-state occupancy.[25, 26] According to these studies, the L₃/L₂
intensity ratio of Fe-L_(2, 3) increases as Fe valence increases from 2+
to 3+. Our EELS result shows an increase in the L₃/L₂ intensity ratio of
the oxygen-annealed sample by 0.58 compared to the ratio of 5.27 in the
as-grown sample, indicating an increase in the oxidation state. This is
consistent with the previous report in the oxygen-annealed FeTe thin
film measured by x-ray absorption spectroscopy.[7, 9] Improvement of
superconductivity was also observed in the FeTe_(1 − x)S_(x) annealed in
oxygen at 200 ^(∘)C by Y. Mizuguchi _et al._,[27, 28] who also attribute
the evolution of superconductivity to suppression of local moment of
excess Fe by oxygen annealing. They also found the induced
superconductivity by oxygen incorporation is suppressed when the
oxygen-annealed sample is annealed again in vacuum, suggesting that the
excess Fe remained in the sample. A similar effect of oxygen annealing
on FeTe_(1 − x)S_(x) was also reported by V.P.S. Awana _et al.[29]_
Although no Fe-valence measurement has been reported in the sulfur-doped
system yet, one may also expect an increase in Fe valence in the
oxygen-annealed FeTe_(1 − x)S_(x). Improvement of superconductivity
induced by oxidation of Fe

data of the O-K edge are shown as the open symbols. The solid curve,

in iron chalcogenide suggests superconductivity is favorable to higher
Fe valence with suppression of the effect of excess Fe.

Hexagonal phases are normally associated with Fe deficiency, as reported
earlier.[21, 30] Oxygen, in the same column of Te/Se, has a stronger
electronegativity. We speculate that oxygen atoms bond with Fe making
the Fe-Te/Se bonding weaker or even broken, resulting in Fe deficiency
in local areas. This and the fact that the hexagonal phase as a more
stable phase at low temperatures, as shown in Ref. [5], provide the
driving force and the pathway for the formation of the hexagonal phases.
In our experiment with annealing in vacuum, the hexagonal phase did not
form during the short period of annealing, although the hexagonal phase
is expected based on the phase diagram consideration. This observation
supports the previous suggestion that the oxygen plays a role in
speeding up the phase transformation.

## IV Conclusions

In summary, we investigated the effect of oxygen annealing in the
nonsuperconducting single crystal Fe_(1.08)Te_(0.55)Se_(0.45). Although
the as-grown sample shows no superconductivity, the oxygen-annealed
sample was found to show an onset T_(c) around 14.5 K, which is close to
that in the optimally doped superconductor. Phase transformation from
the tetragonal PbO-type phase to the hexagonal NiAs-type phase in the
oxygen-annealed sample was found in local areas forming meshlike
contrast, observed by using DF imaging and STEM-HAADF imaging. Such
precipitates of the hexagonal phases formed in the matrix of the
tetragonal phases could be significant for improvement on the critical
current density J_(c) and its isotropy. Improvement of homogeneity in
the tetragonal phase was observed by STEM-HAADF imaging. There is an
increase in the Fe valence in the oxygen-annealed sample, which is
consistent with oxygen doping as evidenced by EELS.
