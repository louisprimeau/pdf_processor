###### Abstract

The intercalated graphite superconductor CaC_{6} with T_{c}\sim 11.5 K has been characterized with angular dependent magnetoresistance measurements. Above T_{c}, the interplane resistivity can be fitted to the Bloch-Gruneisen model providing a Debye temperature of \theta_{D}=175 K. From these parameters, the McMillan formula yields an electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda\sim 1.1, placing this material in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime. For 1.4 K<T<T_{c}, the upper critical field B_{c2} is found to be anisotropic and linear in temperature.

Superconductivity in graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) has been known for decades, but progress to increase the transition temperature T_{c} (from 0.14 to 5 K) has been slow.[1, 2, 3, 4] However, the recent discovery of relatively high T_{c} in materials such as YbC_{6} and CaC_{6} (8 and 11.5 K, respectively)[5, 6] provides new inputs for the understanding of superconductivity in low-dimensional structures, and, recently, pressure has been used to raise the T_{c} of CaC_{6} to 12.3 K at 16 kbar.[7] Current theory[8] supports a model in which T_{c} increases with increased charge transfer from the intercalant to the graphene layers. However, some members of this series seem to contradict this view. For example, in LiC_{6}, the charge transfer is larger than that of KC_{8} (T_{c} =0.15 K), but there is no evidence of superconductivity in LiC_{6}.[9] Superconductivity in GICs presents interesting questions since the constituent elements alone are not superconducting, and recent theoretical efforts have attacked this problem from the view of band structure.[10, 11, 12] The present consensus is that finely tuned electron-phonon interactions give rise to BCS-like superconductivity in GICs, limiting the maximum value of T_{c}.

In this Brief Report, systematic angular and temperature dependent upper critical field magnetoresistivity measurements on the new stage-I GIC superconductor CaC_{6} are presented. A lithium-calcium alloy (of the ratio 3:1) was prepared in an argon glove box at 220 ^{\circ}C, and thin sheets of pristine highly oriented pyrolytic graphite were inserted. The entire sample mixture was sealed in a stainless-steel reaction container, and then placed on a hot plate at 350 ^{\circ}C for 10 days. The samples were extracted from the molten solution inside the glove box, and only very thin samples which exhibited shiny metallic surfaces were used. Air exposure was limited to about 1 h during mounting for magnetic or transport studies. Typical sample sizes were 1.5\times 1 mm^{2} in area and thickness of 0.2 mm. Resistivity was measured using a conventional four-probe method with a current of 1 mA applied along the c axis.[13] Measurements were carried out with a rotation probe in a He-flow cryostat with an 8 T superconducting magnet.

The interplane (c-axis) resistivity and the dc susceptibility vs temperature are shown in Fig. 1. dc susceptibility measurements (lower inset of Fig. 1) yield a superconducting transition temperature T_{c}=11.5 K in a field of 50 G applied parallel to the ab plane. From the saturation of the diamagnetic signal, the samples used were estimated to have a superconducting volume fraction of about 90%.

We first consider the temperature dependence of the interplane (c-axis) resistance in CaC_{6} shown in Fig. 1. Below about 250 K, the resistance decreases monotonically and exhibits an approximate T^{2} dependence between about 50 K and T_{c}. A similar behavior for the temperature dependent resistivity is seen in the compound YbC_{6}, where the cross-over to T^{2} occurs below 30 K.[5] (As will be discussed below, there is a constant nonzero background resistance below T_{c}.) Several models have been used to describe c-axis transport in acceptor-type GICs. These include variable-range hopping in parallel with band conduction[14] and impurity and phonon-assisted hopping.[15, 16] However, in donor compounds where the conductivity is considerably higher, band conduction should become important,[15] and in the CaC_{6} sample studied here, we estimate the interplane conductivity at room temperature to be 8.7\times 10^{3}\Omega^{-1} cm^{-1}, which is a typical value for donor GICs.[17] In light of the above, we have considered both a low temperature Fermi liquid dependence

\[\rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{2}\] (1)

(where A is the T^{2} Fermi liquid prefactor) and, at higher temperatures, a phonon-assisted conduction model[18]

Figure 1: Interplane resistivity of CaC_{6} vs temperature normalized to 297 K (RT). Above 50 K, the data are fitted to Eq. (2). Upper inset: resistivity vs T^{2} fitted to Eq. (1) below 50 K. Lower inset: dc susceptibility for field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) conditions for a 50 Oe field applied in the ab plane. Details of the resistive transition near T_{c} are also shown for comparison.

 \[\rho(T)=\rho_{0}+aT^{2}+BT^{5}\int_{0}^{\theta_{D}/T}\frac{x^{S}}{(e^{x}-1)(1-e^{-x} )}dx\] (2)

to describe the data. [In Eqs. (1) and (2), \rho_{0} is temperature independent.] In Eq. (2), the second term aT^{2} is related to phonon-assisted hopping,[15, 16] and the last term is related to the electron-phonon scattering, also known as the Bloch-Gruneisen formula. (Here, we note that x=\hbar\Omega/kT, where \Omega is the phonon frequency and \theta_{D} is the Debye temperature.) Referring first to the upper inset of Fig. 1, between T_{c} and 50 K, Eq. (1) fits the data very well, with \chi^{2}=0.001, yielding A=7.4(0.02) x 10^{-9}\Omega cm/K^{2}. For the temperature range[19]\deltaT\  Fig. 3, was used to account for the small change of slope that occurs above _B__cero_ near _B__linkayer_.

A comparison of the data in Fig. 3 can be made with two models to determine the dimensionality. The first is the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory, which is valid when the interlayer spacing is much smaller than the _c_-direction coherence length. In this case, the upper critical field depends on the angle between the normal to the layers and the applied field through [31]

\[\left[\frac{B_{c2}(\theta)\text{cos}(\theta)}{B_{c2,1}}\right]^{2}+\left[\frac{ B_{c2}(\theta)\text{sin}(\theta)}{B_{c2,1}}\right]^{2}=1,\] (5)

where the upper critical fields for directions parallel and perpendicular to the _ab_ plane are _B__c2i and _B__c2i. The second is based on the Tinkham model, which describes noncoupled superconducting films thinner than the coherence length. In this case, the angular dependence of the layers is found to be [32]

\[\left|\frac{B_{c2}(\theta)\text{cos}(\theta)}{B_{c2,1}}\right|+\left[\frac{B_ {c2}(\theta)\text{sin}(\theta)}{B_{c2,1}}\right]^{2}=1.\] (6)

This model describes the angular dependence of the magnetoresistivity for thin films and for two-dimensional superconductors in general. [33] The applicability of the models can be determined near 90^{\circ}, where the GL model and the Tinkham model produce a rounded and a cusplike feature, respectively. This comparison is shown in Fig. 3 for the B_{2} data for different criteria. (The GL model with fixed experimental values of _B__c2_i_=1.5 T and _B__c2_i_=0.3 T is also shown for the _B__inflection_ data.) Here, the Tinkham model appears to best describe the data.

We now summarize our experimental findings for CaC6 by discussing the B_{2} anisotropy, the linear B_{2} temperature dependence, and the Fermi liquid character, in turn.

The estimated _c_-axis coherence length x1(0), from Fig. 2, is in the range 4.7-13 nm (using the _B__normal_ and _B__gero_ criteria). Even with the smallest estimate for x1(0), the unit cell spacing is still about 3.5 times smaller (even ten times smaller for the graphene layer spacing), [30] and it is surprising that the Tinkham model describes so well the cusp-like behavior for B_{2} in Fig. 3. (Compare, for instance, with the clear GL behavior seen in NbSe2. [31]) It is possible that the nonzero background resistance in the superconducting state may play a role since it indicates that some layers are not stoichiometrically intercalated and that these normal layers, in series with the superconducting layers, contribute to the resistance. However, all other indications are that the samples are bulk superconductors with optimum T_{c} and B_{2} values, so it is not clear that a small number of nonsuperconducting layers would induce the Tinkham-like behavior near _B__c2i.

The critical fields follow a linear dependence on temperature. A theory to understand the mechanism of superconductivity in GICs has been proposed by Al-Jishi, [10] where superconductivity arises from a coupling between the graphene \pi bands and the intercalant layer s band. This model predicts a linear dependence of the critical field on temperature, [8] but is valid only in the weak-coupling regime (\uplambda\!<\!0.4). However, our results indicate that CaC6 is in the intermediate coupling regime. Although other models have recently been proposed to explain the origin of superconductivity in CaC6, [12, 23, 34] there is no quantitative explanation [other than the simple GL expression in Eq. (4)] for the linear dependence of the upper critical field. The linear H_{2} behavior to very low temperatures is not expected from the standard BCS theory. [35] However, this behavior has been seen in other compounds such as K3C60, [36] which has a very anisotropic Fermi surface. Fermiology experiments in CaC6 can clarify this possibility.

The low temperature _T_^{3} Fermi-liquid-type dependence of the resistivity is consistent with the description of CaC6 as a BCS-like superconductor. Penetration depth measurements [37] and heat capacity experiments [7] have shown that the superconductivity is s wave and BCS-like, respectively. It is surprising that such a large T_{c} of 11.5 K is observed, but given the large coupling parameter deduced from our measurements (and, recently, through specific heat experiments [7]), it is likely that the origin of the superconductivity is through finely tuned electron-phonon interactions. We have calculated the Kadowaki-Woods ratio for CaC6 based on the _T_^{2} coefficient (_A_ = 7.4 x 10^{-9}\Omega cm/K^{2} from the inset of Fig. 1) divided by the square of the linear heat capacity coefficient from recent measurements (\gamma=5.91 mJ^{2}/mol^{2} K^{2}) [7] to yield r_{W} = 1.6 x 10^{-4}\mu\Omega cm(mol K/mJ)^{2}. r_{W}, which is a measure of the electron-electron scattering, is over ten times the value found in heavy fermion compounds [_a_0 = 10^{-5}\mu\Omega cm(mol K/mJ)^{2}]. [38] The only other value which is larger than this in the literature is for Na0.7CoO2, where r_{W} = 50\upalpha_{0}. [39] Since heat capacity is isotropic, in-plane and interplane conduction measurements are needed in CaC6 for a complete comparison. [39]

In this Brief Report, systematic angular and temperature dependent upper critical field magnetoresistivity measurements on the new stage-I GIC superconductor CaC_{6} are presented. A lithium-calcium alloy (of the ratio 3:1) was prepared in an argon glove box at 220 ^{\circ}C, and thin sheets of pristine highly oriented pyrolytic graphite were inserted. The entire sample mixture was sealed in a stainless-steel reaction container, and then placed on a hot plate at 350 ^{\circ}C for 10 days.

Resistivity was measured using a conventional four-probe method with a current of 1 mA applied along the c axis.[13] Measurements were carried out with a rotation probe in a He-flow cryostat with an 8 T superconducting magnet.

The interplane (c-axis) resistivity and the dc susceptibility vs temperature are shown in Fig. 1. dc susceptibility measurements (lower inset of Fig. 1) yield a superconducting transition temperature T_{c}=11.5 K in a field of 50 G applied parallel to the ab plane. From the saturation of the diamagnetic signal, the samples used were estimated to have a superconducting volume fraction of about 90%.

We first consider the temperature dependence of the interplane (c-axis) resistance in CaC_{6} shown in Fig. 1. Below about 250 K, the resistance decreases monotonically and exhibits an approximate T^{2} dependence between about 50 K and T_{c}. A similar behavior for the temperature dependent resistivity is seen in the compound YbC_{6}, where the cross-over to T^{2} occurs below 30 K.[5] (As will be discussed below, there is a constant nonzero background resistance below T_{c}.)

to describe the data. [In Eqs. (1) and (2), \rho_{0} is temperature independent.] In Eq. (2), the second term aT^{2} is related to phonon-assisted hopping,[15, 16] and the last term is related to the electron-phonon scattering, also known as the Bloch-Gruneisen formula. (Here, we note that x=\hbar\Omega/kT, where \Omega is the phonon frequency and \theta_{D} is the Debye temperature.) Referring first to the upper inset of Fig. 1, between T_{c} and 50 K, Eq. (1) fits the data very well, with \chi^{2}=0.001, yielding A=7.4(0.02) x 10^{-9}\Omega cm/K^{2}. For the temperature range[19]\deltaT\  Fig. 3, was used to account for the small change of slope that occurs above _B__cero_ near _B__linkayer_.

A comparison of the data in Fig. 3 can be made with two models to determine the dimensionality. The first is the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory, which is valid when the interlayer spacing is much smaller than the _c_-direction coherence length. In this case, the upper critical field depends on the angle between the normal to the layers and the applied field through [31]

\[\left[\frac{B_{c2}(\theta)\text{cos}(\theta)}{B_{c2,1}}\right]^{2}+\left[\frac{ B_{c2}(\theta)\text{sin}(\theta)}{B_{c2,1}}\right]^{2}=1,\] (5)

where the upper critical fields for directions parallel and perpendicular to the _ab_ plane are _B__c2i and _B__c2i. The second is based on the Tinkham model, which describes noncoupled superconducting films thinner than the coherence length. In this case, the angular dependence of the layers is found to be [32]

\[\left|\frac{B_{c2}(\theta)\text{cos}(\theta)}{B_{c2,1}}\right|+\left[\frac{B_ {c2}(\theta)\text{sin}(\theta)}{B_{c2,1}}\right]^{2}=1.\] (6)

This model describes the angular dependence of the magnetoresistivity for thin films and for two-dimensional superconductors in general. [33] The applicability of the models can be determined near 90^{\circ}, where the GL model and the Tinkham model produce a rounded and a cusplike feature, respectively. This comparison is shown in Fig. 3 for the B_{2} data for different criteria. (The GL model with fixed experimental values of _B__c2_i_=1.5 T and _B__c2_i_=0.3 T is also shown for the _B__inflection_ data.) Here, the Tinkham model appears to best describe the data.

We now summarize our experimental findings for CaC6 by discussing the B_{2} anisotropy, the linear B_{2} temperature dependence, and the Fermi liquid character, in turn.

The estimated _c_-axis coherence length x1(0), from Fig. 2, is in the range 4.7-13 nm (using the _B__normal_ and _B__gero_ criteria). Even with the smallest estimate for x1(0), the unit cell spacing is still about 3.5 times smaller (even ten times smaller for the graphene layer spacing), [30] and it is surprising that the Tinkham model describes so well the cusp-like behavior for B_{2} in Fig. 3. (Compare, for instance, with the clear GL behavior seen in NbSe2. [31]) It is possible that the nonzero background resistance in the superconducting state may play a role since it indicates that some layers are not stoichiometrically intercalated and that these normal layers, in series with the superconducting layers, contribute to the resistance. However, all other indications are that the samples are bulk superconductors with optimum T_{c} and B_{2} values, so it is not clear that a small number of nonsuperconducting layers would induce the Tinkham-like behavior near _B__c2i.

The critical fields follow a linear dependence on temperature. A theory to understand the mechanism of superconductivity in GICs has been proposed by Al-Jishi, [10] where superconductivity arises from a coupling between the graphene \pi bands and the intercalant layer s band. This model predicts a linear dependence of the critical field on temperature, [8] but is valid only in the weak-coupling regime (\uplambda\!<\!0.4). However, our results indicate that CaC6 is in the intermediate coupling regime. Although other models have recently been proposed to explain the origin of superconductivity in CaC6, [12, 23, 34] there is no quantitative explanation [other than the simple GL expression in Eq. (4)] for the linear dependence of the upper critical field. The linear H_{2} behavior to very low temperatures is not expected from the standard BCS theory. [35] However, this behavior has been seen in other compounds such as K3C60, [36] which has a very anisotropic Fermi surface. Fermiology experiments in CaC6 can clarify this possibility.

The low temperature _T_^{3} Fermi-liquid-type dependence of the resistivity is consistent with the description of CaC6 as a BCS-like superconductor. Penetration depth measurements [37] and heat capacity experiments [7] have shown that the superconductivity is s wave and BCS-like, respectively. It is surprising that such a large T_{c} of 11.5 K is observed, but given the large coupling parameter deduced from our measurements (and, recently, through specific heat experiments [7]), it is likely that the origin of the superconductivity is through finely tuned electron-phonon interactions. We have calculated the Kadowaki-Woods ratio for CaC6 based on the _T_^{2} coefficient (_A_ = 7.4 x 10^{-9}\Omega cm/K^{2} from the inset of Fig. 1) divided by the square of the linear heat capacity coefficient from recent measurements (\gamma=5.91 mJ^{2}/mol^{2} K^{2}) [7] to yield r_{W} = 1.6 x 10^{-4}\mu\Omega cm(mol K/mJ)^{2}. r_{W}, which is a measure of the electron-electron scattering, is over ten times the value found in heavy fermion compounds [_a_0 = 10^{-5}\mu\Omega cm(mol K/mJ)^{2}]. [38] The only other value which is larger than this in the literature is for Na0.7CoO2, where r_{W} = 50\upalpha_{0}. [39] Since heat capacity is isotropic, in-plane and interplane conduction measurements are needed in CaC6 for a complete comparison. [39]

Figure 3: Angular dependence of B_{2} for CaC6 at 1.4 K derived from the magnetoresistance data (inset). B_{2} was determined for three different criteria (see text and Ref. [26]). The dashed and solid lines are fits to Eqs. (5) and (6), respectively; the dotted line is for Eq. (5) with _B__c2i and _B__c2i. fixed.

* [19] Remarkably, in Fig. 1, we found that Eq. (2) fitted the data very well (\chi^{2}=0.017) over the entire temperature range between T_{c} and room temperature, yielding \theta_{D}=155 (0.5) K. Nevertheless, a description of the resistivity where the Fermi liquid behavior at low temperatures [Eq. (1)] crosses over near 50 K to phonon-assisted behavior at higher temperatures [Eq. (2)] is more physical.

* [26] The B_{c2} criteria involve systematic features characteristic of the behavior of the MR in the critical field region where, with the exception of B_{normal} the resistance was less than the normal state value. The uncertainties in B_{inflection} (obtained analytically) are of the order \pm0.01 T, but for the other criteria (determined graphically), uncertainties ten times larger are possible.
