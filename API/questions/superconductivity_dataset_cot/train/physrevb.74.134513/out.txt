###### Abstract

The full substitution of Ni by Co and Pt enclosed in the same crystalline structure (_I_4/_mmm_) of Pr-based compounds have been investigated. The structural characteristics, magnetic properties, and magnetoresistance of PrCo2B2C, PrNi2B2C, and PrPt2B2C single crystals were studied to determine the reason for the absence or presence of superconductivity in those compounds. An antiferromagnetic transition was found for PrCo2B2C at about 8.5 K, where the easy magnetization axis is along the _c_-crystallographic direction whereas in PrNi2B2C the easy magnetization was at the _ab_ plane. In PrNi2B2C a small magnetization without traces of saturation is found when it is measured up to 18 Tesla of applied magnetic field. This behavior suggests a screening effect as a result of a moderate hybridization between the conduction band and Pr ions. Superconductivity occurs in PrPt2B2C at about 6 K. The Pt-Pt distance and internal bonding angles are similar to those observed in the superconducting Ni-based compounds. Magnetoresistance measurements show positive and quadratic behavior (D_r_0 - _aH_2) suggesting a spin fluctuation system. In the PrPt2B2C compound the electronic mean free path is smaller than the BCS coherence length (_t_ * _e_) suggesting a dirty type II superconductor.

## I Introduction

Quaternary borocarbides form a family of intermetallic compounds with a wide variety of collective phenomena at low temperatures that have generated a great deal of experimental and theoretical work.[1, 2] The general LuNi2B2C-type structure permits the incorporation of rare earth elements (except Eu), and transition metals such as Ni, Ir, Pt, Co, Pd, and Ru.[1, 2, 3, 4] An interesting aspect of these materials is that they are prototypical systems suitable for the study of the coexistence and/or competition between magnetism and superconductivity.[5, 6, 7] Both phenomena are related to different types of interactions; Ruderman, Kittel, Kasuya, Yosida (RKKY), crystalline electric field (CEF) effects, and electron-phonon coupling. The main effects come from the RKKY interaction and CEF due to the coupling between _f_-electrons and _d_-electron band, responsible for a wide variety of magnetic phenomena.[1, 5, 6, 7]

Experimental studies in these compounds show that the de-Gennes factor roughly decreases with the superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}), indicating a weak magnetic interaction between rare earth ions and conduction electrons. These results could imply that the superconductivity is expected not only for the heavy rare earth ions, but also for the light ones.[8] Band structure calculations for LuNi2B2C and YNi2B2C (Lu, Y/Ni221) superconductors show a peak at the Fermi level with a large contribution to the density of states (DOS) from the 3d nickel band, whereas in light rare earth compounds, the DOS is drastically reduced showing a valley at the Fermi level, a fact that accounts for the absence of superconductivity in these compounds.[1, 9, 10] On the other hand, the complete substitution of Ni by Pt in La and Pr borocarbides leads to superconductivity at 10 and 6 K, respectively.[11] The singular electronic behavior of these compounds has attracted attention because they are the first superconducting systems with light rare earth elements in the modified ThCr2Si structure. In this family, the compounds formed with Pr(Ni,Co)2B2C show long range magnetic ordering and superconducting behavior for the case of PrPt2B2C compound.[11, 12, 13] It is worth mentioning that there are only a few praseodymium based compounds that present superconductivity; that is, among the high T_{c} ceramic superconductors, only those with partial substitutions of praseodymium in the T_{c} phase (_R_2CuO4) have been found superconducting while in the PrBa2Cu3O7-x compound the possibility of superconductivity is still questioned and is under discussion.[14, 15] However, superconductivity has been found in the following intermetallic systems; PrMo6(S,Se)8 compounds (T_{c} ~ 4, and 9 K),[16] borocarbide PrPt2B2C (T_{c} ~ 6 K),[16] and recently in the PrOs4Sb12 which is a heavy fermion skutterudite with T_{c} ~ 1.8 K.[17]

Under this scenario a systematic study of the changes observed in structural and electronic properties for Pr_T_2B2C (_T_ = Ni, Co, and Pt) single crystals is presented. The exchange of Ni by Co or Pt increases the c parameter with an anomalous contraction of the _ab_ plane. In PrCo2B2C a strong anisotropy is observed in the magnetic properties, with the easy spin orientation in the [001] direction, instead of the [110] direction found by neutron diffraction experiments in the PrNi2B2C compound. The complete substitution of Ni by Pt causes significant changes in the electronic properties, which lead to one of these uncommon superconducting ma terials (_T_c ~ 6 K) where nonmagnetic ordering has been found down to 1 K. The electronic mean free path is smaller than the BCS coherence length leading to dirty type II superconductor (_t_ <= e0). The Ginzburg-Landau parameters are discussed and compared with homologue quasiclean Ni-superconductor systems.

## II Experimental Details

Single crystals were grown using a water cooled copper crucible in a radio frequency induction furnace.18 The purity of the starting materials was Pr 99.9%, Ni 99.9%, Co 99.99%, Pt 99.9%, B 99.8%, and C 99.9998%. As-grown single crystals were used for this study (degradation processes in samples annealed for long periods of time have been observed). The samples were studied by x-ray diffraction, using a Bruker P4 diffractometer at room temperature with monochromatized Mo-_Ka_ radiation (l = 0.710 73 A, 50 KV, 30 mA). Cell parameters were refined using a large set of centered reflections. A complete diffraction sphere (eight octants merged in the I4/_mmm_ space group) was measured19 for each crystal, up to the highest resolution achievable, namely 0.50 A for PrCo2B2C and 0.58 A for PrPt2B2C. Raw data were corrected for absorption effects on the basis of _ps_ scans, considering the crystals as laminar. The structures were refined by full matrix least squares, using atomic scattering factors provided by the program package SHELXL-97 (Ref. 20). In the last cycles, extinction effects were corrected through a semiempirical formula21 and convenient weighting schemes were applied to the structure factors. In the case of PrPt2B2C, B and C atoms were refined isotropically, to avoid nonpositive thermal ellipsoids for these atoms. Very large residuals are observed in the final difference Fourier maps, particularly for the PrPt2B2C refinement, which should be attributed to somewhat inaccurate absorption corrections rather than to actual residual electronic density. Complete data, including structure factors, are available on request as CIF files.

The magnetization data presented here were obtained using a quantum design SQUID magnetometer with the magnetic field applied along the _a-b_ and c directions of the plate-like single crystals with typical dimension of about 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 mm. The _M_(_H_, _T_) data were taken under zero field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) modes. Magnetization vs applied magnetic field measurements was extended up to 18 Tesla at the CNRS-Max Planck High Magnetic Fields Laboratory, at Grenoble, France.

Resistivity measurements were performed from 2-300 K using four 25 _m_m gold wires attached with silver paint to the crystal and the applied ac flowing in the _ab_ plane. Magnetoresistance measurements were performed with a 7.8 Tesla superconducting magnet using 20 _m_m gold wires with an injected current of 10 mA using a standard four-probe technique. The samples were carefully aligned and fixed with glue, and the magnetic field perpendicularly applied to the _ab_ plane at constant temperature.

## III Results and Discussion

### X-ray single crystal analysis of Pr_T_2B2C with T = Ni, Co, and Pt

As expected, the I4/_mmm_ space group was confirmed from the intensity measurements of symmetry-related reflections for PrCo2B2C and PrPt2B2C crystals. In the first case, no extra spots were detected on the photographic plates, revealing the single crystal nature; in contrast, the PrPt2B2C crystal displays some diffuse spots, suggesting a different mosaic structure. The difference is clearly seen by the lowest diffraction intensity in PrPt2B2C compared to Pr(Ni, Co)2B2C crystal. However, it was possible to obtain an accurate structural analysis. The atomic coordinates and the thermal parameters (_U_eq) from the refinement cycling are included in Table I. Lattice parameters, metal-metal bond lengths and motion of the internal bonding of _T_B4 framework parameters are listed in Table II, for isomorphic Pr_T_2B2C [_T_ = Ni,22 Co, and Pt] single crystals.

The main structural characteristics observed in PrPt2B2C when Ni is substituted by Co, or Pt can be summarized in the following manner: Co and Pt have ionic radii of 0.72 and 0.80 A as compared to 0.69 A for Ni, and hence one would expect a lattice expansion by complete Co or Pt substitution. However, the structural analysis shows that the Co based compound presents a cell volume slightly contracted as compared to the Ni compound. This is an inconsistent behavior from the viewpoint of a chemical-pressure effect. For the Pt-based compound, the cell volume is increased by about 14%, consistent with the larger ionic radius of this metal.

The anomalous contraction observed in PrCo2B2C is reflected in the structural parameters, mainly at the Co-Co bond length in the _ab_ planes. The Co-Co distance is the shortest observed in these three compounds. However, we noted that the Ni-Ni and Co-Co distances in PrNi2B2C and PrCo2B2C are both still slightly larger than the corresponding _T_-_T_ distances observed in the superconducting (_Y_,_R_)Ni-based compounds 3,18 The short Co-Co bond length gives raise to a reduction of the B-Co distance within the CoB4 tetrahedra, which in turn, decreases the a parameter by about 2.2% of the unit cell. The simultaneous increase of

  3.4% for the c parameter yields a distortion of the tetrahedral _T_B4 framework, with bond angles B-_T_-B of 104.4(1)deg in PrCo2B2C, instead of 103.33(7)deg as found for PrNi2B4C; in other words, when compared with the Co-based phase, the Ni-based phase presents a smoothing of the T2B2 layers normal to the c axis, which is directly related to the thickness of this layer (see Fig. 1 and Table 1). On the other hand, the full isostructural substitution of Ni by Pt significantly modifies the c and a parameters, as expected from the large Pt ionic radius. In PrPt2B2C, the Pt-Pt distance of 2.7134(1) A in the _ab_ plane is shorter than the atomic distance expected from the metallic Pt-Pt fcc distance (2.77 A), suggesting not only strong metal-metal bonding, but also a decrease in the stability of the _R_Pt2B2C compounds with other smaller R lanthanide ions.3 Furthermore, it is noted that the distance between the Pt2B2 and the Pr-C layer, _d_B-C=1.478(9) A, is quite close to the distance between the Ni2B2 and the Pr-C layer, _d_B-C=1.484(3) A, but slightly larger in Pr/Co compound, _d_B-C=1.546(6) A. This rigid bond has been observed without appreciable change in the whole series of _R_/Ni borocarbides.3,23 In the internal _T_B4 framework it is observed that the layer thickness increases about 2.76% and 19.4% when Ni is substituted by Co and Pt, respectively. This behavior suggests a significant weakness of the covalent bonds of the 5d Pt orbitals with 2_p_-B nearest neighbor. The increase of 7.7% in the c parameter for PrPt2B2C respect to the Ni-based compound is reflected not only by the large B-_T_ -B bond angle of the tetrahedral _T_B4 framework, from 103.33(7) for Ni-based to 104.43(12) for Co-based compounds, to 106.6(3)deg for the Pt-based (_a_ in Fig. 1), but also by the Pt2B2 layer thickness, contrary to the Co-based compound, where the c parameter is influenced by a slight increase of both, B-C distance and the B-_T_-B bond angle.

From the point of view of electronic structure calculations,9,10 the lack of superconductivity in the large lanthanide ions in the Ni-based borocarbides has been attributed to the decrease in the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level, caused by changes in the internal structural features. From this picture, the changes in B-_T_-B angles observed in PrNi2B2C and PrCo2B2C might explain the disappearance of superconductivity via reduction of the DOS. In contrast, the structural changes in PrPt2B2C favor the increase of the DOS at _N_(_E_F_), as well as an increase of the electron-phonon coupling. This is in agreement with the fact that the structural parameters observed in the DyNi2B2C superconductor, where the Ni-B-Ni=107.03(6)deg angle and the Ni-Ni=2.5017(1) A length are similar. In both systems superconductivity appears at about 6 K.24,25

Another significant feature which should be noted from the single-crystal diffraction patterns is the characteristic sharp peak profiles observed for PrPt2B2C, compared to the Pr-Ni and Pr-Co samples. A qualitative explanation may be related to a low defect concentration in the Pt-based compound.

### Resistivity and magnetization measurements in PrCo3B2C

The temperature dependence of the susceptibility in the ZFC mode under an applied field of 100 Oe along with the resistivity measured from 50 to 2 K for a PrCo2B2C single crystal are shown in Fig. 2. A slight resistivity drop is observed at ~20 K with a tendency to saturation below that temperature. A minimum value of about 1.7 _m_U_O cm was found at 2 K. The transition temperature is made evident as a peak at ~8.5 K of the susceptibility versus temperature plot. The continuous decrease of the resistivity and the peak in the susceptibility data are clear evidence of antiferromagnetic order (AFM). This AFM transition becomes broader and quite similar to that found in PrNi2B2C and other rare earth compounds of this family.22,26 The residual resistivity ratio (RRR) measured in the _ab_ plane is about 32 which is larger than that of PrNi2B2C single crystals22 even to reach similar values of RRR to that produced by flux growth in _R_Ni2B2C parent single crystals compounds (see Table 3).

 tion given in Ref. 27, yields a value of 183 A, almost twice as large as that for PrNi_{2}B_{2}C (l=97 A).

Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of the susceptibility \chi(T) in a 100 Oe applied magnetic field parallel to the ab plane and to the c axis for a PrCo_{2}B_{2}C crystal. The inset shows an expanded plot below 30 K. In the studied temperature range, the susceptibility data does not obey Curie-Weiss law even when the temperature-independent susceptibility term, \chi_{0}, is included. The reason for this behavior is that, at about 155 K, there is a change in the susceptibility data in both directions. The jump in the susceptibility at 155 K, in the ab plane is smaller (0.18 emu/mol) than in the c direction (0.37 emu/mol). It is important to mention that this anomaly is quite similar in shape to the jump observed in magnetization measurements at 15 K in PrNi_{2}B_{2}C crystals, although the temperature is one order of magnitude higher. In that case [22] the possibility that the anomaly at 15 K could be explained under a spin canted scenario in Pr ion and/or as a ferrimagnetic transition due to the two magnetic sublattices was discussed, and this fact was related to the absence of superconductivity. At low temperature, the AFM transition takes place at about 8.5 K and it is manifested as a broad peak in the susceptibility measurements [see inset in Fig. 3(a)]. Indeed, a large magnetic anisotropy is observed when the magnetic field is applied along the ab plane and the c axis. This anisotropic behavior is similar to other RT_{2}B_{2}C (R= rare earth, and T=Ni, Co) single crystals where the strong anisotropy was attributed to CEF interactions [7, 26]. A rather surprising result of this work is that the total substitution of Ni by Co changes the direction of the ordered Pr magnetic moments. While for (Pr, Ho, Tb)Ni_{2}B_{2}C single crystals [24, 22, 28], the susceptibility data has larger values when the field is applied parallel to the ab plane (H\parallelab plane); for PrCo_{2}B_{2}C single crystal, the larger values of susceptibility data in the c direction suggest that the alignment of the Pr moments are confined in this direction implying different magnetic structure. However, for deeper insight of the spin sublattice involved, neutron diffraction studies will be necessary to corroborate both, the magnetic transition type and the magnetic structure of this compound.

Figure 3(b) shows the M vs T data at several magnetic fields along the c axis. At low magnetic fields, the two magnetic anomalies are clearly seen at 8.5 and 155 K. In order to analyze this behavior, the inset in Fig. 3(b) shows a graph of dM/dT vs T. The intensity of the applied magnetic field influences the magnetic peak at low temperatures. At low field, the peak is at 8.5 K and is shifted to 18 K as the magnetic field is increased. This behavior is similar to that of the PrNi_{2}B_{2}C crystal [22]. The effect of the external magnetic field on the anomaly at 155 K is quite different since it tends to

However, the possibility that this magnetic anomaly arise from another source, such as a small amount of magnetic impurities, is not discarded; literature does not report any combination of quaternary elements giving raise to this type of anomaly at this temperature. For instance, impurities phases such as PrCo_{4}B (_T_curie\sim 459 K), PrCo_{2}B_{2} (_T_curie\sim 36 K), PrCo_{4}B_{4} (_T_curie\sim 171 K), PrCo_{12}B_{6} (_T_curie\sim 157 K), and PrB_{2}C_{2} (van Vleck paramagnet) have not been observed in our samples unless this magnetic signal arise from another unknown Co-B-C phases as was pointed out by Mazumdar _et al._[29, 30, 31] However, as mentioned before, the analysis in the complete diffraction sphere shows no extra spots in the photographic plates. Hence, the possibility that microscopic polycrystalline aggregates were the origin of the secondary magnetic component can be excluded. Accordingly, it can be assumed that the magnetic component is an intrinsic feature of the PrCo_{2}B_{2}C phase. To explain such experimental observation it is hypothesized that the occurrence of this magnetic transition arises from the distortion of the tetrahedral _T_B_{4} environment as a result of the short Co-Co bond length and the decrease of the B-Co distance, which is related to the anomalous _ab_-plane contraction (see Table 1). Such distorted structure can alter the antisymmetric exchange in the Co site causing the effect of a weak ferromagnetic order leading to spins canted in the CoB_{4} sublattice as has been argued in other borocarbides,[28] although it was generally admitted that the transition metals in the superconducting borocarbide systems are not magnetic. On the other hand, recent studies in Ru/Co-based tronucleuprates have shown a delicate balance between weak ferromagnetic signal and the change of the Ru/Co environment in the crystalline structure.[32]

### Magnetoresistance measurements in PrPt_{2}B_{2}C

Figure 4 shows the in-plane resistivity for PrPt_{2}B_{2}C as a function of temperature from 300 to 4 K. The room temperature resistivity is about 144 \mu\Omega cm, whereas the resistivity just above the onset temperature, _T_onset is 26 \mu\Omega cm. This gives a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of 5.5, which is higher than the values previously reported in polycrystalline samples (\sim1.75).[33] Inset (a) shows the superconducting transition at about 6 K, with a width of 0.35 K, measured between 10% and 90% of the resistivity drop. The ZFC and FC susceptibility measurements corroborate the bulk superconducting state, as seen in the lower right inset (b). A striking feature can be observed in the normal state resistivity as a smooth hump extended over a fairly broad temperature range just above _T_c. This feature is not observed in other superconducting materials, we believe that this behavior arises from crystalline electric field effects. Recently, magnetic and heat capacity measurements performed by Dhar _et al.[33]_ indicated that the absence of magnetic ordering may be due to splitting of the Pr^{+3} (_J_=4) ground state as a consequence of CEF, giving raise to a nonmagnetic singlet ground state.

To further explore this anomalous behavior the resistance has been measured without magnetic field, and as a function

  of the applied magnetic field for several temperatures. In panel (a) of Fig. 5, the in-plane resistance _R_(_T_) is shown from 30 down to 4.2 K without applied magnetic field. Panel (b) shows the transverse magnetoresistance (MR) at different temperatures (28, 20, 14, 10, 7, and 4.2 K) with the applied field parallel to the c axis. There, the real resistance behavior at selected fix temperatures (dotted line) is measured when the applied magnetic field is swept up (_H_+) and down (_H_+) to 8 Tesla. The results show positive magnetoresistance behavior for all selected temperatures.

Two regions are found in which the resistance does not change when the magnetic field is applied. One region is above 20 K, where no substantial resistance change is evident between _R_(_H_ = 0) and _R_(_H_ = 7.9 T). However, below 14 K a discernible change is observed when the magnetic field is increased. The arrows mark the resistance region where the magnetic field intensity increases the scattering rate, modifying the resistance value. This resistance increase becomes more pronounced at low temperatures. These features can be seen in Fig. 6, where the normalized magnetoresistance, D_r_(_H_)/_r_(0) = [_r_(_H_,_T_)-_r_(0,_T_)]/_r_(0,_T_), is plotted at several temperatures. At 28 and 20 K, the D_r_(_H_)/_r_(0) is small, positive, and proportional to the applied magnetic field, reminiscent of the nonmagnetic analog (Lu,Y)Ni2B2C compounds. This behavior was explained by the formation of open orbits at the Fermi surface as were used by Rathnayaka _et al._ and Narozhnyi _et al._27,34 to explain the linear behavior and the relative high values of MR in the Lu/YNi2B2C compound. They suggest, based on the electronic band structure, that there are open orbits along the c axis which lead to positive and relatively high values of MR; on the contrary, closed orbits at the Fermi surface in this direction could lead to saturation of MR as was observed by Martin _et al._35 in polycrystalline copper. In accordance with this behavior, we also speculate that PrPt2B2C may present open orbits in this direction and subsequent linear dependence of the MR on the field; however to corroborate this conclusion it will be necessary to perform an electronic band analysis and subsequent MR measurements in the _I_ll_c and _H_|_ab_ plane and c configuration. Another remarkable feature in this compound is the magnitude of the MR, which is lower than that obtained for (Y,Lu)Ni2B2C. This result could be due to the different topology of the Fermi surface with respect to the Y/Lu221 superconducting compounds.

In the inset of Fig. 6, the percent change of the MR as a function of temperature is plotted at three different magnetic fields; 7.9, 5, and 2 T. There is a continuous increase of MR when the temperature decreases, with a maximum at about 25% at 7.9 T and 4.2 K. The MR is positive and varies quadratically with H (MR _n_+_H_, n ~ 2). This behavior is an indication of a typical spin-fluctuation system. The quadratic behavior changes depending on the temperature. For instance, just above _T_c (7 K), the quadratic behavior is observed in the overall range of the applied field while at 10 K, MR varies as _n_~ 2.5 from 0 to 7.9 T. The positive and quadratic behavior of the MR is observed, in general, in systems with AFM ordering,36 e.g., in the HoNi2B2C (T_{N} = 5 K) and HoNiBC (T_{N} = 9.4 K) parent compounds, the MR curves above and below T_{N} are negative with roughly an H2 field dependence.37,38 The negative MR was not expected but it can be attributed to the polarization of the _d_-band (via RKKY indirect exchange) which induces a small magnetic moment in the Ni layer around this temperature. However, despite the fact that the PrPt2B2C in single or polycrystalline form does not present any magnetic order. MR reveals its dependence on the magnetization in the range of studied temperature. This dependence is consistent with the formation of the spin fluctuation, surely from Pt ions since, as already pointed out, it was recently confirmed that the Pr ions in the crystal field split lead to singlet ground state at low temperatures, therefore inducing nonmagnetic

  moment.[33] In this case the positive and quadratic behavior suggests that the 4d electrons are not totally quenched, and they are both spatially and temporally correlated playing an important role in the MR behavior and quite likely to the superconducting state.

### Superconducting characteristics of PrPt_{2}B_{2}C

Figure 7 presents the plot of the upper critical field (H_{c2}) as a function of temperature from T_{c} down to 1.2 K. The H_{c2}(T) is almost linear from 5.6 to 2 K in both directions. Below 2 K the data slightly departs from linearity. This fact indicates that neither a magnetic transition, nor intermetallic impurities are present in the Pr/Pt matrix. Furthermore, a small anisotropy was observed with a larger increase of H_{c2}(T) in the _ab_ plane becoming larger at low temperatures. This behavior is very similar to that found in other nonmagnetic borocarbides such as, LuNi_{2}B_{2}C, YNi_{2}B_{2}C.[27] The resulting upper critical field, H_{c2}(0) is about 14.5 and \sim 13.0 kOe for H\mid_ab_ and H\mid_c_, respectively. The electronic mean free path was estimated from the formula, l = 3/2(0)e^{2}v_{F}p_{0}, and the BCS coherence length by \xi_{0} = \hbarv_{F}/T_{c}. The experimental value of the residual resistivity was \rho_{0}=24 \mu\Omega cm, measured just above T_{c}. The values of N(0)=4.8 states/eV cell and v_{F}=3.6\times 10^{5} cm/seg, taken from the band structure calculation for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [39]) were used. The estimated electronic mean free path was l \sim 18 A, a smaller value than the BCS coherence length, which was estimated to be about \xi_{0}\sim 860 A; according to these two values this is a dirty type II superconductor (\iota\ll\xi_{0}). Once this limit is determined, the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence length \xi(0), upper critical field H_{c2}(0), and penetration depth \lambda(0), were extracted from the experimental slope data for each direction (2.986 kOe/K and -2.698 kOe/K for H\mid_ab_ and H\mid_c_, respectively) in Fig. 7 as well as the value of the lower critical field H_{c1}. In this last case, it was obtained from the isothermal magnetization measurements M(H) at different temperatures; 1.8, 3, and 4 K, in a polycrystalline sample as shown in the inset of Fig. 7. The lower critical field is about 60 Oe at 1.8 K. The Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa(0), was determined using 2H_{c1}/H_{c2} = In(\kappa) + 0.5/\kappa^{2}, and is about 16.5\pm 1. A good agreement was found for the values of H_{c2}(0) and H_{c1}(0) calculated from the G-L relationships: H_{c2}(0)=0.693T_{c}[-4H_{c2}/dT] H_{c1} = (\phi_{0}/4\pi\lambda2)(In \kappa + 0.5), and the experimental extrapolation values H_{c2}(0) and H_{c1}(0) derived from magnetoresistance and magnetization measurements. The values for the H_{c2}(0), \xi(0), and \lambda(0) parameters are listed in Table 3 and are compared with those values of RNi_{2}B_{2}C-related intermetallic compounds. The estimated parameters for (La,Pr,)Pt_{2}B_{2}C along with those reported in the literature for RNi_{2}B_{2}C are shown in Fig. 8. Both end compounds show the highest T_{c} and the highest H_{c2}(0). We note that the empty _f_-electrons belonging to the latter half and the filling earlier half of the rare earth series decrease the T_{c} and H_{c2}(0) while the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length, \xi(0) and the magnetic

  field penetration depth l(0) is increased in _R_Pt2B2C and _R_Ni2B2C series. The decrease of _H__c_2 and T_{c} with the rare earth local moment suggests that the superconducting electrons are affected by the R local moment via indirect exchange coupling. The larger decrease of _H__c_2(0) and T_{c} suggest that superconductivity is strongly affected by the presence of R local moments via indirect exchange coupling. However, at this moment it is difficult to explain the large reduction of these parameters (_H__c_2 and T_{c}) in PrPt2B2C in terms of the picture of the indirect exchange coupling because of the singlet ground state of the PrPt2B2C compound (nonmagnetic). In accordance with this thermodynamic behavior, one could expect superconducting behavior at lower temperatures in the NdPt2B2C compound. Recently, this prediction was confirmed by Paulose _et al._[40] where a superconducting transition at about 2.8 K was found in this compound.

## IV Conclusions

We have performed a detailed study of the crystalline structure, magnetization, and magnetotransport properties for Pr_T_2B2C (_T_=Ni, Co, and Pt) single crystals. The structural parameters show an anomalous contraction in the _ab_ plane and volume in PrCo2B2C, which do not correspond to the ionic radii size and/or chemical pressure effects. Susceptibility data measured in PrCo2B2C show a broad peak at about 8.5 K at low magnetic field, which has been interpreted as an AFM transition. The axis of easy magnetization occurs in the c direction instead of along the _ab_ plane as seen in the PrNi2B2C compound. The only superconducting system found in this study is the PrPt2B2C crystal with an onset transition temperature at 6 K. Here, the Pt-Pt distance is shorter than in the Pt metallic (fcc structure) suggesting a decrease of the crystal stability for smaller lanthanide ions in the _R_Pt2B2C series. A positive MR with quadratic field dependence between 4.2 and 7 K is found implying that the 4d electrons of Pt ions are not totally quenched. This behavior suggests a spin-fluctuation superconductor system. Finally, the superconducting parameters for the PrPt2B2C compound were determined. The upper critical field, _H__c_2(_T_), is anisotropic, similar to other nonmagnetic borocarbides. From the values of the electronic mean free path and the coherence length, PrPt2B2C can be classified as a dirty type II superconductor (_t_ <= x0) with Ginzburg-Landau parameter k = 17 +- 1.

###### Abstract

The full substitution of Ni by Co and Pt enclosed in the same crystalline structure (_I_4/_mmm_) of Pr-based compounds have been investigated. The structural characteristics, magnetic properties, and magnetoresistance of PrCo2B2C, PrNi2B2C, and PrPt2B2C single crystals were studied to determine the reason for the absence or presence of superconductivity in those compounds. An antiferromagnetic transition was found for PrCo2B2C at about 8.5 K, where the easy magnetization axis is along the _c_-crystallographic direction whereas in PrNi2B2C the easy magnetization was at the _ab_ plane. In PrNi2B2C a small magnetization without traces of saturation is found when it is measured up to 18 Tesla of applied magnetic field. This behavior suggests a screening effect as a result of a moderate hybridization between the conduction band and Pr ions. Superconductivity occurs in PrPt2B2C at about 6 K. The Pt-Pt distance and internal bonding angles are similar to those observed in the superconducting Ni-based compounds. Magnetoresistance measurements show positive and quadratic behavior (D_r_0 - _aH_2) suggesting a spin fluctuation system. In the PrPt2B2C compound the electronic mean free path is smaller than the BCS coherence length (_t_ * _e_) suggesting a dirty type II superconductor.

## I Introduction

Quaternary borocarbides form a family of intermetallic compounds with a wide variety of collective phenomena at low temperatures that have generated a great deal of experimental and theoretical work.[1, 2] The general LuNi2B2C-type structure permits the incorporation of rare earth elements (except Eu), and transition metals such as Ni, Ir, Pt, Co, Pd, and Ru.[1, 2, 3, 4] An interesting aspect of these materials is that they are prototypical systems suitable for the study of the coexistence and/or competition between magnetism and superconductivity.[5, 6, 7] Both phenomena are related to different types of interactions; Ruderman, Kittel, Kasuya, Yosida (RKKY), crystalline electric field (CEF) effects, and electron-phonon coupling. The main effects come from the RKKY interaction and CEF due to the coupling between _f_-electrons and _d_-electron band, responsible for a wide variety of magnetic phenomena.[1, 5, 6, 7]

Experimental studies in these compounds show that the de-Gennes factor roughly decreases with the superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}), indicating a weak magnetic interaction between rare earth ions and conduction electrons. These results could imply that the superconductivity is expected not only for the heavy rare earth ions, but also for the light ones.[8] Band structure calculations for LuNi2B2C and YNi2B2C (Lu, Y/Ni221) superconductors show a peak at the Fermi level with a large contribution to the density of states (DOS) from the 3d nickel band, whereas in light rare earth compounds, the DOS is drastically reduced showing a valley at the Fermi level, a fact that accounts for the absence of superconductivity in these compounds.[1, 9, 10] On the other hand, the complete substitution of Ni by Pt in La and Pr borocarbides leads to superconductivity at 10 and 6 K, respectively.[11] The singular electronic behavior of these compounds has attracted attention because they are the first superconducting systems with light rare earth elements in the modified ThCr2Si structure. In this family, the compounds formed with Pr(Ni,Co)2B2C show long range magnetic ordering and superconducting behavior for the case of PrPt2B2C compound.[11, 12, 13] It is worth mentioning that there are only a few praseodymium based compounds that present superconductivity; that is, among the high T_{c} ceramic superconductors, only those with partial substitutions of praseodymium in the T_{c} phase (_R_2CuO4) have been found superconducting while in the PrBa2Cu3O7-x compound the possibility of superconductivity is still questioned and is under discussion.[14, 15] However, superconductivity has been found in the following intermetallic systems; PrMo6(S,Se)8 compounds (T_{c} ~ 4, and 9 K),[16] borocarbide PrPt2B2C (T_{c} ~ 6 K),[16] and recently in the PrOs4Sb12 which is a heavy fermion skutterudite with T_{c} ~ 1.8 K.[17]

Under this scenario a systematic study of the changes observed in structural and electronic properties for Pr_T_2B2C (_T_ = Ni, Co, and Pt) single crystals is presented. The exchange of Ni by Co or Pt increases the c parameter with an anomalous contraction of the _ab_ plane. In PrCo2B2C a strong anisotropy is observed in the magnetic properties, with the easy spin orientation in the [001] direction, instead of the [110] direction found by neutron diffraction experiments in the PrNi2B2C compound. The complete substitution of Ni by Pt causes significant changes in the electronic properties, which lead to one of these uncommon superconducting ma terials (_T_c ~ 6 K) where nonmagnetic ordering has been found down to 1 K. The electronic mean free path is smaller than the BCS coherence length leading to dirty type II superconductor (_t_ <= e0). The Ginzburg-Landau parameters are discussed and compared with homologue quasiclean Ni-superconductor systems.

## II Experimental Details

Single crystals were grown using a water cooled copper crucible in a radio frequency induction furnace.18 The purity of the starting materials was Pr 99.9%, Ni 99.9%, Co 99.99%, Pt 99.9%, B 99.8%, and C 99.9998%. As-grown single crystals were used for this study (degradation processes in samples annealed for long periods of time have been observed). The samples were studied by x-ray diffraction, using a Bruker P4 diffractometer at room temperature with monochromatized Mo-_Ka_ radiation (l = 0.710 73 A, 50 KV, 30 mA). Cell parameters were refined using a large set of centered reflections. A complete diffraction sphere (eight octants merged in the I4/_mmm_ space group) was measured19 for each crystal, up to the highest resolution achievable, namely 0.50 A for PrCo2B2C and 0.58 A for PrPt2B2C. Raw data were corrected for absorption effects on the basis of _ps_ scans, considering the crystals as laminar. The structures were refined by full matrix least squares, using atomic scattering factors provided by the program package SHELXL-97 (Ref. 20). In the last cycles, extinction effects were corrected through a semiempirical formula21 and convenient weighting schemes were applied to the structure factors. In the case of PrPt2B2C, B and C atoms were refined isotropically, to avoid nonpositive thermal ellipsoids for these atoms. Very large residuals are observed in the final difference Fourier maps, particularly for the PrPt2B2C refinement, which should be attributed to somewhat inaccurate absorption corrections rather than to actual residual electronic density. Complete data, including structure factors, are available on request as CIF files.

The magnetization data presented here were obtained using a quantum design SQUID magnetometer with the magnetic field applied along the _a-b_ and c directions of the plate-like single crystals with typical dimension of about 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 mm. The _M_(_H_, _T_) data were taken under zero field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) modes. Magnetization vs applied magnetic field measurements was extended up to 18 Tesla at the CNRS-Max Planck High Magnetic Fields Laboratory, at Grenoble, France.

Resistivity measurements were performed from 2-300 K using four 25 _m_m gold wires attached with silver paint to the crystal and the applied ac flowing in the _ab_ plane. Magnetoresistance measurements were performed with a 7.8 Tesla superconducting magnet using 20 _m_m gold wires with an injected current of 10 mA using a standard four-probe technique. The samples were carefully aligned and fixed with glue, and the magnetic field perpendicularly applied to the _ab_ plane at constant temperature.

## III Results and Discussion

### X-ray single crystal analysis of Pr_T_2B2C with T = Ni, Co, and Pt

As expected, the I4/_mmm_ space group was confirmed from the intensity measurements of symmetry-related reflections for PrCo2B2C and PrPt2B2C crystals. In the first case, no extra spots were detected on the photographic plates, revealing the single crystal nature; in contrast, the PrPt2B2C crystal displays some diffuse spots, suggesting a different mosaic structure. The difference is clearly seen by the lowest diffraction intensity in PrPt2B2C compared to Pr(Ni, Co)2B2C crystal. However, it was possible to obtain an accurate structural analysis. The atomic coordinates and the thermal parameters (_U_eq) from the refinement cycling are included in Table I. Lattice parameters, metal-metal bond lengths and motion of the internal bonding of _T_B4 framework parameters are listed in Table II, for isomorphic Pr_T_2B2C [_T_ = Ni,22 Co, and Pt] single crystals.

The main structural characteristics observed in PrPt2B2C when Ni is substituted by Co, or Pt can be summarized in the following manner: Co and Pt have ionic radii of 0.72 and 0.80 A as compared to 0.69 A for Ni, and hence one would expect a lattice expansion by complete Co or Pt substitution. However, the structural analysis shows that the Co based compound presents a cell volume slightly contracted as compared to the Ni compound. This is an inconsistent behavior from the viewpoint of a chemical-pressure effect. For the Pt-based compound, the cell volume is increased by about 14%, consistent with the larger ionic radius of this metal.

The anomalous contraction observed in PrCo2B2C is reflected in the structural parameters, mainly at the Co-Co bond length in the _ab_ planes. The Co-Co distance is the shortest observed in these three compounds. However, we noted that the Ni-Ni and Co-Co distances in PrNi2B2C and PrCo2B2C are both still slightly larger than the corresponding _T_-_T_ distances observed in the superconducting (_Y_,_R_)Ni-based compounds 3,18 The short Co-Co bond length gives raise to a reduction of the B-Co distance within the CoB4 tetrahedra, which in turn, decreases the a parameter by about 2.2% of the unit cell.

  3.4% for the c parameter yields a distortion of the tetrahedral _T_B4 framework, with bond angles B-_T_-B of 104.4(1)deg in PrCo2B2C, instead of 103.33(7)deg as found for PrNi2B4C; in other words, when compared with the Co-based phase, the Ni-based phase presents a smoothing of the T2B2 layers normal to the c axis, which is directly related to the thickness of this layer (see Fig. 1 and Table 1). On the other hand, the full isostructural substitution of Ni by Pt significantly modifies the c and a parameters, as expected from the large Pt ionic radius. In PrPt2B2C, the Pt-Pt distance of 2.7134(1) A in the _ab_ plane is shorter than the atomic distance expected from the metallic Pt-Pt fcc distance (2.77 A), suggesting not only strong metal-metal bonding, but also a decrease in the stability of the _R_Pt2B2C compounds with other smaller R lanthanide ions.3 Furthermore, it is noted that the distance between the Pt2B2 and the Pr-C layer, _d_B-C=1.478(9) A, is quite close to the distance between the Ni2B2 and the Pr-C layer, _d_B-C=1.484(3) A, but slightly larger in Pr/Co compound, _d_B-C=1.546(6) A. This rigid bond has been observed without appreciable change in the whole series of _R_/Ni borocarbides.3,23 In the internal _T_B4 framework it is observed that the layer thickness increases about 2.76% and 19.4% when Ni is substituted by Co and Pt, respectively. This behavior suggests a significant weakness of the covalent bonds of the 5d Pt orbitals with 2_p_-B nearest neighbor. The increase of 7.7% in the c parameter for PrPt2B2C respect to the Ni-based compound is reflected not only by the large B-_T_ -B bond angle of the tetrahedral _T_B4 framework, from 103.33(7) for Ni-based to 104.43(12) for Co-based compounds, to 106.6(3)deg for the Pt-based (_a_ in Fig. 1), but also by the Pt2B2 layer thickness, contrary to the Co-based compound, where the c parameter is influenced by a slight increase of both, B-C distance and the B-_T_-B bond angle.

From the point of view of electronic structure calculations,9,10 the lack of superconductivity in the large lanthanide ions in the Ni-based borocarbides has been attributed to the decrease in the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level, caused by changes in the internal structural features. From this picture, the changes in B-_T_-B angles observed in PrNi2B2C and PrCo2B2C might explain the disappearance of superconductivity via reduction of the DOS. In contrast, the structural changes in PrPt2B2C favor the increase of the DOS at _N_(_E_F_), as well as an increase of the electron-phonon coupling. This is in agreement with the fact that the structural parameters observed in the DyNi2B2C superconductor, where the Ni-B-Ni=107.03(6)deg angle and the Ni-Ni=2.5017(1) A length are similar. In both systems superconductivity appears at about 6 K.24,25

Another significant feature which should be noted from the single-crystal diffraction patterns is the characteristic sharp peak profiles observed for PrPt2B2C, compared to the Pr-Ni and Pr-Co samples. A qualitative explanation may be related to a low defect concentration in the Pt-based compound.

### Resistivity and magnetization measurements in PrCo3B2C

The temperature dependence of the susceptibility in the ZFC mode under an applied field of 100 Oe along with the resistivity measured from 50 to 2 K for a PrCo2B2C single crystal are shown in Fig. 2. A slight resistivity drop is observed at ~20 K with a tendency to saturation below that temperature. A minimum value of about 1.7 _m_U_O cm was found at 2 K. The transition temperature is made evident as a peak at ~8.5 K of the susceptibility versus temperature plot. The continuous decrease of the resistivity and the peak in the susceptibility data are clear evidence of antiferromagnetic order (AFM). This AFM transition becomes broader and quite similar to that found in PrNi2B2C and other rare earth compounds of this family.22,26 The residual resistivity ratio (RRR) measured in the _ab_ plane is about 32 which is larger than that of PrNi2B2C single crystals22 even to reach similar values of RRR to that produced by flux growth in _R_Ni2B2C parent single crystals compounds (see Table 3).

 tion given in Ref. 27, yields a value of 183 A, almost twice as large as that for PrNi_{2}B_{2}C (l=97 A).

Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of the susceptibility \chi(T) in a 100 Oe applied magnetic field parallel to the ab plane and to the c axis for a PrCo_{2}B_{2}C crystal. The inset shows an expanded plot below 30 K. In the studied temperature range, the susceptibility data does not obey Curie-Weiss law even when the temperature-independent susceptibility term, \chi_{0}, is included. The reason for this behavior is that, at about 155 K, there is a change in the susceptibility data in both directions. The jump in the susceptibility at 155 K, in the ab plane is smaller (0.18 emu/mol) than in the c direction (0.37 emu/mol). It is important to mention that this anomaly is quite similar in shape to the jump observed in magnetization measurements at 15 K in PrNi_{2}B_{2}C crystals, although the temperature is one order of magnitude higher. In that case [22] the possibility that the anomaly at 15 K could be explained under a spin canted scenario in Pr ion and/or as a ferrimagnetic transition due to the two magnetic sublattices was discussed, and this fact was related to the absence of superconductivity. At low temperature, the AFM transition takes place at about 8.5 K and it is manifested as a broad peak in the susceptibility measurements [see inset in Fig. 3(a)]. Indeed, a large magnetic anisotropy is observed when the magnetic field is applied along the ab plane and the c axis. This anisotropic behavior is similar to other RT_{2}B_{2}C (R= rare earth, and T=Ni, Co) single crystals where the strong anisotropy was attributed to CEF interactions [7, 26]. A rather surprising result of this work is that the total substitution of Ni by Co changes the direction of the ordered Pr magnetic moments. While for (Pr, Ho, Tb)Ni_{2}B_{2}C single crystals [24, 22, 28], the susceptibility data has larger values when the field is applied parallel to the ab plane (H\parallelab plane); for PrCo_{2}B_{2}C single crystal, the larger values of susceptibility data in the c direction suggest that the alignment of the Pr moments are confined in this direction implying different magnetic structure. However, for deeper insight of the spin sublattice involved, neutron diffraction studies will be necessary to corroborate both, the magnetic transition type and the magnetic structure of this compound.

Figure 3(b) shows the M vs T data at several magnetic fields along the c axis. At low magnetic fields, the two magnetic anomalies are clearly seen at 8.5 and 155 K. In order to analyze this behavior, the inset in Fig. 3(b) shows a graph of dM/dT vs T. The intensity of the applied magnetic field influences the magnetic peak at low temperatures. At low field, the peak is at 8.5 K and is shifted to 18 K as the magnetic field is increased. This behavior is similar to that of the PrNi_{2}B_{2}C crystal [22]. The effect of the external magnetic field on the anomaly at 155 K is quite different since it tends to

However, the possibility that this magnetic anomaly arise from another source, such as a small amount of magnetic impurities, is not discarded; literature does not report any combination of quaternary elements giving raise to this type of anomaly at this temperature. For instance, impurities phases such as PrCo_{4}B (_T_curie\sim 459 K), PrCo_{2}B_{2} (_T_curie\sim 36 K), PrCo_{4}B_{4} (_T_curie\sim 171 K), PrCo_{12}B_{6} (_T_curie\sim 157 K), and PrB_{2}C_{2} (van Vleck paramagnet) have not been observed in our samples unless this magnetic signal arise from another unknown Co-B-C phases as was pointed out by Mazumdar _et al._[29, 30, 31] However, as mentioned before, the analysis in the complete diffraction sphere shows no extra spots in the photographic plates. Hence, the possibility that microscopic polycrystalline aggregates were the origin of the secondary magnetic component can be excluded. Accordingly, it can be assumed that the magnetic component is an intrinsic feature of the PrCo_{2}B_{2}C phase. To explain such experimental observation it is hypothesized that the occurrence of this magnetic transition arises from the distortion of the tetrahedral _T_B_{4} environment as a result of the short Co-Co bond length and the decrease of the B-Co distance, which is related to the anomalous _ab_-plane contraction (see Table 1). Such distorted structure can alter the antisymmetric exchange in the Co site causing the effect of a weak ferromagnetic order leading to spins canted in the CoB_{4} sublattice as has been argued in other borocarbides,[28] although it was generally admitted that the transition metals in the superconducting borocarbide systems are not magnetic. On the other hand, recent studies in Ru/Co-based tronucleuprates have shown a delicate balance between weak ferromagnetic signal and the change of the Ru/Co environment in the crystalline structure.[32]

### Magnetoresistance measurements in PrPt_{2}B_{2}C

Figure 4 shows the in-plane resistivity for PrPt_{2}B_{2}C as a function of temperature from 300 to 4 K. The room temperature resistivity is about 144 \mu\Omega cm, whereas the resistivity just above the onset temperature, _T_onset is 26 \mu\Omega cm. This gives a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of 5.5, which is higher than the values previously reported in polycrystalline samples (\sim1.75).[33] Inset (a) shows the superconducting transition at about 6 K, with a width of 0.35 K, measured between 10% and 90% of the resistivity drop. The ZFC and FC susceptibility measurements corroborate the bulk superconducting state, as seen in the lower right inset (b). A striking feature can be observed in the normal state resistivity as a smooth hump extended over a fairly broad temperature range just above _T_c. This feature is not observed in other superconducting materials, we believe that this behavior arises from crystalline electric field effects. Recently, magnetic and heat capacity measurements performed by Dhar _et al.[33]_ indicated that the absence of magnetic ordering may be due to splitting of the Pr^{+3} (_J_=4) ground state as a consequence of CEF, giving raise to a nonmagnetic singlet ground state.

To further explore this anomalous behavior the resistance has been measured without magnetic field, and as a function

  of the applied magnetic field for several temperatures. In panel (a) of Fig. 5, the in-plane resistance _R_(_T_) is shown from 30 down to 4.2 K without applied magnetic field. Panel (b) shows the transverse magnetoresistance (MR) at different temperatures (28, 20, 14, 10, 7, and 4.2 K) with the applied field parallel to the c axis. There, the real resistance behavior at selected fix temperatures (dotted line) is measured when the applied magnetic field is swept up (_H_+) and down (_H_+) to 8 Tesla. The results show positive magnetoresistance behavior for all selected temperatures.

Two regions are found in which the resistance does not change when the magnetic field is applied. One region is above 20 K, where no substantial resistance change is evident between _R_(_H_ = 0) and _R_(_H_ = 7.9 T). However, below 14 K a discernible change is observed when the magnetic field is increased. The arrows mark the resistance region where the magnetic field intensity increases the scattering rate, modifying the resistance value. This resistance increase becomes more pronounced at low temperatures. These features can be seen in Fig. 6, where the normalized magnetoresistance, D_r_(_H_)/_r_(0) = [_r_(_H_,_T_)-_r_(0,_T_)]/_r_(0,_T_), is plotted at several temperatures. At 28 and 20 K, the D_r_(_H_)/_r_(0) is small, positive, and proportional to the applied magnetic field, reminiscent of the nonmagnetic analog (Lu,Y)Ni2B2C compounds. This behavior was explained by the formation of open orbits at the Fermi surface as were used by Rathnayaka _et al._ and Narozhnyi _et al._27,34 to explain the linear behavior and the relative high values of MR in the Lu/YNi2B2C compound. They suggest, based on the electronic band structure, that there are open orbits along the c axis which lead to positive and relatively high values of MR; on the contrary, closed orbits at the Fermi surface in this direction could lead to saturation of MR as was observed by Martin _et al._35 in polycrystalline copper. In accordance with this behavior, we also speculate that PrPt2B2C may present open orbits in this direction and subsequent linear dependence of the MR on the field; however to corroborate this conclusion it will be necessary to perform an electronic band analysis and subsequent MR measurements in the _I_ll_c and _H_|_ab_ plane and c configuration. Another remarkable feature in this compound is the magnitude of the MR, which is lower than that obtained for (Y,Lu)Ni2B2C. This result could be due to the different topology of the Fermi surface with respect to the Y/Lu221 superconducting compounds.

In the inset of Fig. 6, the percent change of the MR as a function of temperature is plotted at three different magnetic fields; 7.9, 5, and 2 T. There is a continuous increase of MR when the temperature decreases, with a maximum at about 25% at 7.9 T and 4.2 K. The MR is positive and varies quadratically with H (MR _n_+_H_, n ~ 2). This behavior is an indication of a typical spin-fluctuation system. The quadratic behavior changes depending on the temperature. For instance, just above _T_c (7 K), the quadratic behavior is observed in the overall range of the applied field while at 10 K, MR varies as _n_~ 2.5 from 0 to 7.9 T. The positive and quadratic behavior of the MR is observed, in general, in systems with AFM ordering,36 e.g., in the HoNi2B2C (T_{N} = 5 K) and HoNiBC (T_{N} = 9.4 K) parent compounds, the MR curves above and below T_{N} are negative with roughly an H2 field dependence.37,38 The negative MR was not expected but it can be attributed to the polarization of the _d_-band (via RKKY indirect exchange) which induces a small magnetic moment in the Ni layer around this temperature. However, despite the fact that the PrPt2B2C in single or polycrystalline form does not present any magnetic order. MR reveals its dependence on the magnetization in the range of studied temperature. This dependence is consistent with the formation of the spin fluctuation, surely from Pt ions since, as already pointed out, it was recently confirmed that the Pr ions in the crystal field split lead to singlet ground state at low temperatures, therefore inducing nonmagnetic

  moment.[33] In this case the positive and quadratic behavior suggests that the 4d electrons are not totally quenched, and they are both spatially and temporally correlated playing an important role in the MR behavior and quite likely to the superconducting state.

### Superconducting characteristics of PrPt_{2}B_{2}C

Figure 7 presents the plot of the upper critical field (H_{c2}) as a function of temperature from T_{c} down to 1.2 K. The H_{c2}(T) is almost linear from 5.6 to 2 K in both directions. Below 2 K the data slightly departs from linearity. This fact indicates that neither a magnetic transition, nor intermetallic impurities are present in the Pr/Pt matrix. Furthermore, a small anisotropy was observed with a larger increase of H_{c2}(T) in the _ab_ plane becoming larger at low temperatures. This behavior is very similar to that found in other nonmagnetic borocarbides such as, LuNi_{2}B_{2}C, YNi_{2}B_{2}C.[27] The resulting upper critical field, H_{c2}(0) is about 14.5 and \sim 13.0 kOe for H\mid_ab_ and H\mid_c_, respectively. The electronic mean free path was estimated from the formula, l = 3/2(0)e^{2}v_{F}p_{0}, and the BCS coherence length by \xi_{0} = \hbarv_{F}/T_{c}. The experimental value of the residual resistivity was \rho_{0}=24 \mu\Omega cm, measured just above T_{c}. The values of N(0)=4.8 states/eV cell and v_{F}=3.6\times 10^{5} cm/seg, taken from the band structure calculation for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [39]) were used. The estimated electronic mean free path was l \sim 18 A, a smaller value than the BCS coherence length, which was estimated to be about \xi_{0}\sim 860 A; according to these two values this is a dirty type II superconductor (\iota\ll\xi_{0}). Once this limit is determined, the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence length \xi(0), upper critical field H_{c2}(0), and penetration depth \lambda(0), were extracted from the experimental slope data for each direction (2.986 kOe/K and -2.698 kOe/K for H\mid_ab_ and H\mid_c_, respectively) in Fig. 7 as well as the value of the lower critical field H_{c1}. In this last case, it was obtained from the isothermal magnetization measurements M(H) at different temperatures; 1.8, 3, and 4 K, in a polycrystalline sample as shown in the inset of Fig. 7. The lower critical field is about 60 Oe at 1.8 K. The Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa(0), was determined using 2H_{c1}/H_{c2} = In(\kappa) + 0.5/\kappa^{2}, and is about 16.5\pm 1. A good agreement was found for the values of H_{c2}(0) and H_{c1}(0) calculated from the G-L relationships: H_{c2}(0)=0.693T_{c}[-4H_{c2}/dT] H_{c1} = (\phi_{0}/4\pi\lambda2)(In \kappa + 0.5), and the experimental extrapolation values H_{c2}(0) and H_{c1}(0) derived from magnetoresistance and magnetization measurements. The values for the H_{c2}(0), \xi(0), and \lambda(0) parameters are listed in Table 3 and are compared with those values of RNi_{2}B_{2}C-related intermetallic compounds. The estimated parameters for (La,Pr,)Pt_{2}B_{2}C along with those reported in the literature for RNi_{2}B_{2}C are shown in Fig. 8. Both end compounds show the highest T_{c} and the highest H_{c2}(0). We note that the empty _f_-electrons belonging to the latter half and the filling earlier half of the rare earth series decrease the T_{c} and H_{c2}(0) while the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length, \xi(0) and the magnetic

  field penetration depth l(0) is increased in _R_Pt2B2C and _R_Ni2B2C series. The decrease of _H__c_2 and T_{c} with the rare earth local moment suggests that the superconducting electrons are affected by the R local moment via indirect exchange coupling. The larger decrease of _H__c_2(0) and T_{c} suggest that superconductivity is strongly affected by the presence of R local moments via indirect exchange coupling. However, at this moment it is difficult to explain the large reduction of these parameters (_H__c_2 and T_{c}) in PrPt2B2C in terms of the picture of the indirect exchange coupling because of the singlet ground state of the PrPt2B2C compound (nonmagnetic). In accordance with this thermodynamic behavior, one could expect superconducting behavior at lower temperatures in the NdPt2B2C compound. Recently, this prediction was confirmed by Paulose _et al._[40] where a superconducting transition at about 2.8 K was found in this compound.

## IV Conclusions

We have performed a detailed study of the crystalline structure, magnetization, and magnetotransport properties for Pr_T_2B2C (_T_=Ni, Co, and Pt) single crystals. The structural parameters show an anomalous contraction in the _ab_ plane and volume in PrCo2B2C, which do not correspond to the ionic radii size and/or chemical pressure effects. Susceptibility data measured in PrCo2B2C show a broad peak at about 8.5 K at low magnetic field, which has been interpreted as an AFM transition. The axis of easy magnetization occurs in the c direction instead of along the _ab_ plane as seen in the PrNi2B2C compound. The only superconducting system found in this study is the PrPt2B2C crystal with an onset transition temperature at 6 K. Here, the Pt-Pt distance is shorter than in the Pt metallic (fcc structure) suggesting a decrease of the crystal stability for smaller lanthanide ions in the _R_Pt2B2C series. A positive MR with quadratic field dependence between 4.2 and 7 K is found implying that the 4d electrons of Pt ions are not totally quenched. This behavior suggests a spin-fluctuation superconductor system. Finally, the superconducting parameters for the PrPt2B2C compound were determined. The upper critical field, _H__c_2(_T_), is anisotropic, similar to other nonmagnetic borocarbides. From the values of the electronic mean free path and the coherence length, PrPt2B2C can be classified as a dirty type II superconductor (_t_ <= x0) with Ginzburg-Landau parameter k = 17 +- 1.
