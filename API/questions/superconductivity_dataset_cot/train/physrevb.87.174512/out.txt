###### Abstract

We report a strategy to induce superconductivity in the BiS_{2}-based compound LaOBiS_{2}. Instead of substituting F for O, we increase the charge-carrier density (electron dope) via substitution of tetravalent Th^{+4}, Hf^{+4}, Zr^{+4}, and Ti^{+4} for trivalent La^{+3}. It is found that both the LaOBiS_{2} and ThOBiS_{2} parent compounds are bad metals and that superconductivity is induced by electron doping with T_{c} values of up to 2.85 K. The superconducting and normal states were characterized by electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity measurements. We also demonstrate that reducing the charge-carrier density (hole doping) via substitution of divalent Sr^{+2} for La^{+3} does not induce superconductivity.

## I Introduction

Superconductivity with T_{c} = 8.6 K has recently been reported in the layered compound Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}.[1, 2] Following this report, several other BiS_{2}-based superconductors, including LnO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2} (Ln = La_{4}, Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb) with T_{c} as high as 10 K, have been synthesized and studied.[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] These materials have a layered crystal structure composed of superconducting BiS_{2} layers and blocking layers of Bi_{4}O_{4}(SO_{4})_{1-x} for Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} and LnO for LnO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2} (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Yb). This structural configuration is similar to the situation encountered in the high-T_{c} layered cuprate and Fe-pnictide superconductors in which superconductivity primarily resides in CuO_{2} planes and Fe-pnictide layers, respectively.[13, 14, 15, 16, 17] Even though BiS_{2}-based superconductors share a similar crystal structure with Fe-pnictide superconductors, they exhibit some important differences. The undoped parent compounds, LnFeAsO, display a spin density wave (SDW) or a structural instability near 150 K.[15, 16, 17] Superconductivity emerges when the SDW is suppressed towards zero temperature either through charge carrier doping or application of pressure.[18]T_{c} is raised as high as 55 K by replacement of La by other rare-earth elements such as Sm.[15, 16] In contrast, the phosphorus-based analogues LnFePO do not show a SDW transition or structural instability but still exhibit superconductivity.[19, 20] For LaFePO, values of T_{c} that range from 3 to 7 K,[20, 21] without charge carrier doping, have been reported. Both LnFeAsO and LnFePO remain metallic to low temperatures, while the undoped parent compounds LnOBiS_{2} are bad metals. It has been suggested that superconductivity emerges in close proximity to an insulating normal state for the optimal superconducting sample.[11]

Several distinct examples of chemical substitution have been found to induce superconductivity in LnFeAsO compounds including substituting F for O,[12, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27] Co for Fe,[28] Sr for La,[29] Th for Gd,[30] and also the introduction of oxygen vacancies.[31, 32] Substituting F for O induces superconductivity in BiS_{2}-based superconductors.[33, 34, 35, 36, 34, 36, 34, 33] To determine whether superconductivity might emerge under other conditions, we chose to dope electrons via chemical substitution on the La site in LaOBiS_{2}. In this study, we demonstrate that substitution of tetravalent Th^{+4}, Hf^{+4}, Zr^{+4}, and Ti^{+4} for trivalent La^{+3} in LaOBiS_{2} induces superconductivity. We also observed that substitution of divalent Sr^{+2} for La^{+3} (hole doping) does not induce superconductivity.

## II Experimental Methods

Polycrystalline samples of La_{1-x}Th_{x}OBiS_{2}(0 \leqslant x \leqslant 1), La_{1-x}Hf_{x}OBiS_{2}(0 \leqslant x \leqslant 0.4), La_{1-x}Zr_{x}OBiS_{2}(0 \leqslant x \leqslant 0.3), and La_{1-x}Sr_{x}OBiS_{2}(0 \leqslant x \leqslant 0.3), (0 \leqslant x \leqslant 0.3) were prepared by a two-step solid state reaction method using high-purity starting materials. Initially, the Bi_{2}S_{3} precursor powders were prepared by reacting Bi and S grains together at 500 degC in an evacuated quartz tube for 10 hours. Starting materials of La, La_{2}O_{3}, S, and Bi_{2}S_{3} powders and either M = Th or Ti chunks, Hf granules, or Zr foil, were weighed in stoichiometric ratios based on nominal concentrations La_{1-x}M_{x}BiS_{2} (M = Th, Hf, Zr, Ti). Next, they were thoroughly mixed, pressed into pellets, sealed in evacuated quartz tubes, and annealed at 865^{<}C for 72 hours. Additional regrinding and sintering at 700^{<}C for 3 days was performed to promote phase homogeneity. The crystal structure was verified by means of x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 Discover x-ray diffractometer with Cu-K_{\alpha} radiation. The resulting XRD patterns were fitted via Rietveld refinement[37] using the gsas+expgui software package.[38, 39] The chemical composition was investigated by means of energy dispersive x rays (EDX) using a FEI Quanta 600 scanning electron microscope equipped with an INCA EDX detector from Oxford instruments. Electrical resistivity measurements were performed using a home-built probe in a liquid ^{4}He Dewar for temperatures 1 K \leqslantT\leqslant 300 K by means of a standard four-wire technique using a Linear Research LR700 ac resistance bridge. Magnetization measurements were made for 2 K \leqslantT\leqslant 300 K and in magnetic fields H = 5 Oe using a Quantum Design MPMS. Alternating current magnetic susceptibility was measured down to \sim1 K in a liquid ^{4}He Dewar. Specific heat measurements and electrical resistivity measurements under applied magnetic  field for La_{0.85}Th_{0.15}OBiS_{2} and La_{0.8}Hf_{0.2}OBiS_{2} samples were performed for 0.36 K \leqslantT\leqslant 30 K in a Quantum Design PPMS DynaCool with a ^{3}He insert using a thermal relaxation technique.

## III Results

### Crystal structure and sample quality

Figure 1 shows the powder XRD patterns of LaOBiS_{2} and ThOBiS_{2} samples. Overall, the main diffraction peaks of these two samples can be well indexed to a tetragonal structure with space group P4/mmn. The crystal structure has previously been designated as having the ZrCuSiAs type structure,[3, 4, 5, 5] however, the CeOBiS_{2} type structure may be a more appropriate structure assignment.[11] While the crystal structure of LaOBiS_{2} and ThOBiS_{2} has a different Wyckoff sequence than that of ZrCuSiAs, it has the same Wyckoff sequence and positions, and similar unit cell parameter ratios (c/a) as the crystal structure for CeOBiS_{2}.[40] The crystallographic data for ThOBiS_{2} obtained from Reitveld refinement of the powder XRD pattern given in Fig. 1 are tabulated in Table 1. The inset of Fig. 2(a), displays the crystal structure of LaOBiS_{2}. The structure is composed of stacked La_{2}O_{2} layers and two BiS_{2} layers in each unit cell. To dope electrons into the BiS_{2} conduction layers, we substituted tetravalent Th^{+4}, Hf^{+4}, Zr^{+4}, and Ti^{+4} for La^{+3} and to dope holes into the BiS_{2} conduction layers, we substituted divalent Sr^{+2} for trivalent La^{+3}. We find that samples for the entire range of Th substitutions below the solubility limit, Hf substitutions in the range 0.1 \leqslantx\leqslant 0.4, and Zr, Ti, and Sr substitutions in the range 0.1 \leqslantx\leqslant 0.3 can be described by the same space group. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the lattice parameters a and c for La_{1-x}Th_{x}OBiS_{2}(0 \leqslantx\leqslant 1) decrease with increasing Th concentration, although the relative decrease of a is much smaller than that of c. With Th doping, the positions of Bragg reflections shift systematically. For example, the (004) reflections shift to higher angles, consistent with a decrease of c. This result indicates that Th is really incorporated into the lattice; although, some amounts of elemental Bi and/or Bi_{2}S_{3} separate from the lattice, indicated by arrows in Figs. 1

  and 2(a). We could not always distinguish between whether the impurity phase was Bi or Bi_{2}S_{3}, since their Bragg reflections occur at very similar positions. If the impurity is assumed to be Bi, the amount is between 3% to 15% by mass and if the impurity is assumed to be Bi_{2}S_{3}, the amount is between 5% to 18% by mass. In either case, the ratio increases with increasing Th concentration. If the impurity is Bi, there should be other La-S-O based impurities, but we could not detect any elemental S or La impurities or binary compounds made from La-S-O. The impurity is therefore likely Bi_{2}S_{3}, which should be balanced with a La_{2}O_{3} impurity. Unfortunately, the Bragg reflections of La_{2}O_{3} overlap with the main phase peak positions, which makes it difficult to estimate the impurity ratio of La_{2}O_{3} using Rietveld refinement. For 0.5\leqslant x\leqslant 0.9, the lattice parameters (not shown) are close to the lattice parameters of ThOBiS_{2} and do not change appreciably with x. The impurity amount increases with x and other impurity peaks begin to appear in this region, indicating the probable existence of a solubility limit of La/Th near x=0.45.

More direct evidence of Th incorporation into the lattice comes from chemical composition measurements by energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) microanalysis. The EDX spectrum was collected from a single grain. Quantitative analysis for selected samples gives La:Th ratios of 0.08, 0.12, 0.18, and 0.24 for the samples with nominal ratios 0.1, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.25, respectively. This result demonstrates that most of the Th was successfully doped into the samples.

For the Hf, Zr, and Ti substitutions, the powder XRD patterns and lattice parameters a and c are given for La_{1-x}M_{x}OBiS_{2} with M= Hf, Zr, Ti, Sr and x=0.2 in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. The lattice parameters a and c exhibit behavior similar to Th substitution, wherein the c lattice parameter decreases with increasing Hf, Zr, and Ti concentration and the a lattice parameter does not show an appreciable concentration dependence. For Sr substitution, the a lattice parameter increases slightly, while c decreases with increasing Sr concentration. Even though the ionic size of Th is bigger than the others (Hf, Zr, and Ti), the c lattice parameters are very close to each other. The decrease of the c axis may be attributed to a strengthening of the interlayer bonding as a consequence of doping.

### Electrical resistivity

Electrical resistivity \rho(T) data, normalized by the value of \rho at 290 K, are shown in Fig. 4 for the pure LaOBiS_{2} and ThOBiS_{2} samples. For both compounds, \rho initially decreases with decreasing temperature, exhibits a minimum at T=220 and 206 K, respectively, and then shows semiconductor-like behavior down to the lowest temperatures measured. For the La_{1-x}Th_{x}OBiS_{2} system, the minimum in \rho is suppressed for x=0.1, and \rho(T) exhibits relatively strong temperature dependence and an inflection point (indicated by an arrow) as shown in Fig. 4(b). For x=0.15, this feature disappears and \rho drops to zero below T_{c}=2.85 K. \rho(T) becomes less temperature dependent for 0.15\leqslant x\leqslant 0.45 and increases with decreasing temperature until the onset of superconductivity. First-principles calculations have suggested that there may be a charge density wave instability or enhanced correlations in the LaO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2} system.[33] We are unable to unambiguously observe such an instability from the electrical resistivity measurements in this study. However, the inflection point could be related to such an effect.

Electrical resistivity measurements for La_{1-x}Hf_{x}OBiS_{2}, La_{1-x}Zr_{x}OBiS_{2}, and La_{1-x}Ti_{x}OBiS_{2} samples are shown in Figs. 5-7, respectively. Resistive superconducting transition curves for these systems are indicated in the right inset

(b) \rho, normalized by its value at 290 K, vs T for La_{1-x}Th_{x}OBiS_{2}(0\leqslant x\leqslant 1). (c) \rho, normalized to its value in the normal state at 5 K, vs T emphasizing the transition into the superconducting state.

  of Figs. 5-6 and in Fig. 7(c). All of these doping studies show similar characteristics such as an inflection point anomaly in the normal state with low concentration and induced superconductivity for concentrations starting with x=0.15 for La_{1-x}Th_{x}OBiS_{2} and x=0.2 for La_{1-x}Hf_{x}OBiS_{2}, La_{1-x}Zr_{x}OBiS_{2}, and La_{1-x}Ti_{x}OBiS_{2}. Furthermore, all of these systems show semiconductor-like behavior in the normal state. The inflection point in \rho of samples with low concentration is emphasized in the left inset of Figs. 5 and 6, and in Fig. 7(b) where the anomaly is indicated by an arrow. These anomalies all appear to be present at a common temperature of roughly 120 K in concentrations x just below those where superconductivity is induced. To compare the superconducting transition temperatures (T_{c}), we consider data for 20% substitution of La by Th, Hf, Zr, and Ti in Fig. 8(a). The superconducting transition temperatures, as shown in Fig. 8(b), are characterized by the temperatures where the electrical resistivity drops to 50% of the normal state resistivity, and the width of the transition is determined by the temperatures where the resistivity drops to 90% and 10% of the normal state resistivity. Electron doping clearly induces superconductivity in LaOBiS_{2}. The T_{c}'s are quite similar to one another, but the transition width is sharper for La_{0.8}Hf_{0.2}OBiS_{2} and La_{0.8}Ti_{0.2}OBiS_{2} than for La_{0.8}Zr_{0.2}OBiS_{2} and La_{0.8}Th_{0.2}OBiS_{2}. The lowest T_{c} is seen in La_{0.8}Zr_{0.2}OBiS_{2}. There does not appear to be a clear correlation between T_{c} and the lattice parameters. Meanwhile, Fig. 9 shows \rho(T) measurements for La_{1-x}Sr_{x}OBiS_{2} wherein no evidence of a superconducting transition is observed down to \sim1 K in the range 0.1\leq x\leq 0.3. This result suggests that hole doping is not sufficient to induce superconductivity. It is, however, interesting to note that the magnitude of \rho at low temperatures increases with increasing Sr concentration, which is similar to the behavior observed with Th, Hf, Zr, and Ti doping.

  The temperature dependence of \rho, normalized by its value at 5 K for La0.85Tb0.15OBiS2 and La0.8Hf0.2OBiS2 samples, is shown in Figs. 10(a) and 10(b), respectively, under several applied magnetic fields (H = 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1, and 9 T) down to 0.36 K. Both samples undergo relatively sharp superconducting transitions at T_{c} = 2.85 and 2.40 K for La0.8Tb0.2OBiS2 and La0.8Hf0.2OBiS2, respectively. With increasing magnetic field, the transition width broadens and the onset of superconductivity gradually shifts to lower temperatures. Similar broadening of the transition was observed in the high-T_{c} layered cuprate and Fe-pnictide superconductors and attributed to the vortex-liquid state.[34, 41] Figures 10(c) and 10(d) show the upper critical field H_{c} versus T for La0.85Tb0.15OBiS2 and La0.8Hf0.2OBiS2 samples, corresponding to the temperatures where the resistivity drops to 90% of the normal state resistivity \rho_{\rm{t}}(T,H) (T_{c,{\rm{onset}}}), 50% of \rho_{\rm{t}}(T,H) (T_{c}), and 10% of \rho_{\rm{t}}(T,H) (T_{c,{\rm{zero}}}) in applied magnetic fields. Using the conventional one-band Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory,[42] the orbital critical fields H_{c2}(0) for La0.85Tb0.15OBiS2 and La0.8Hf0.2OBiS2 compounds were inferred from their initial slopes of H_{c} with respect to T, yielding values of 1.09 and 1.12 T, respectively. These values of H_{c2}(0) are very close to the values seen in Sr1-1.2La_{x}FBiS2 (1.04 T)[43] and La0.85Tb0.5BiS2 (1.9 T),[8] suggesting that the superconducting state in BiS2-based superconductors probably shares a common character.

### Magnetization

To determine whether superconductivity is a bulk phenomenon in La1-xM_{\rm{x}}OBiS2, zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) measurements of the magnetic susceptibility \chi_{\rm{dc}}(T) were made in a magnetic field of 5 Oe for the La0.85Tb0.15OBiS2 and La0.8Hf0.2OBiS2 samples. These measurements are plotted in Figs. 11(a) and 11(c). ZFC measurements yield diamagnetic screening signals with T_{c} onset values that are lower than values obtained from \rho(T) data, while FC measurements reveal evidence for strong vortex pinning. Alternating current magnetic susceptibility measurements for La0.85Tb0.15OBiS2 and La0.8Hf0.2OBiS2 samples are shown in Figs. 11(b) and 11(d), respectively. These data exhibit signatures of SC with slightly lower T_{c}'s than those observed in \rho and \chi_{\rm{dc}} measurements. It is clear that, even though the superconducting transition is incomplete at 1.3 K, the volume fractions are \sim67% and \sim16% for La0.85Tb0.15OBiS2 and La0.8Hf0.2OBiS2 samples, respectively, according to the ac magnetic susceptibility measurements.

The temperature corresponding to the 50% normal state \rho is also shown.

  

### Specific heat

Specific heat data for La_{0.85}Th_{0.15}OBiS_{2} and La_{0.8}Hf_{0.2}OBiS_{2} samples are displayed in Figs. 12 and 13, respectively. The data for La_{0.85}Th_{0.15}OBiS_{2} cover the temperature range 0.36 to 30 K. A fit of the expression C(T)=\gamma\,T+\beta T^{3} to the data in the normal state, where \gamma is the electronic specific heat coefficient and \beta is the coefficient of the lattice contribution, is plotted as a function of T^{2} in the inset in the upper left-hand side of Fig. 12. From the best fit, which is explicitly indicated by a line in the inset, we obtain values of \gamma=0.58 mJ/mol f.u. K^{2} and \beta=0.91 mJ/mol f.u. K^{4}; the value of \beta corresponds to a Debye temperature of \Theta_{D}=220 K. In the inset in the lower right-hand side of Fig. 12, C_{c}/T versus T is plotted. A clear feature is observed between 1 and 3 K. If this feature is related to the transition into the superconducting state, we can estimate T_{c}=2.5 K from an idealized entropy conserving construction. This value of T_{c} is close to the temperature obtained from the electrical resistivity (T_{c}=2.85 K). The presence of the feature may suggest that superconductivity is a bulk phenomenon in this compound. The ratio of the specific heat jump to \gamma\,T_{c}, \Delta C/\gamma\,T_{c}=0.91, was calculated using a jump in C_{c}/T of 0.53 mJ/mol f.u. K^{2}, extracted from the entropy conserving construction as seen in the inset in the lower right-hand side of the figure. This value is less than the value of 1.43 predicted by the BCS theory, but is similar to that seen in LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}.[12]

The specific heat data for La_{0.8}Hf_{0.2}OBiS_{2} are displayed between 0.36 and 30 K in Fig. 13. The upper inset of Fig. 13 highlights the linear fit to the C/T data plotted versus T^{2}, from which we extracted \gamma=2.12 mJ/mol f.u. K^{2} and \beta=0.82 mJ/mol f.u. K^{4} and calculated \Theta_{D}=228 K. In the inset in the lower right-hand side of the figure, the electronic contribution to the specific heat C_{c}/T versus T is shown, which has been obtained by subtracting the lattice contribution \beta T^{3} from C(T). Absent from these data is any clear evidence for a jump at the T_{c} obtained from either the electrical resistivity or dc and ac magnetic susceptibility (T_{c}=2.36, 2.81, and 1.42 K, respectively) measurements. However, there

Figure 14: (Color online) (a) Superconducting transition temperature T_{c} vs Th concentration x phase diagram for the La_{1-x}Th_{x}OBiS_{2} system. The phase diagram is constructed from electrical resistivity \rho (filled triangles), dc magnetic susceptibility Y_{dc} (filled diamonds), and ac magnetic susceptibility X_{ac} (filled circles) measurements. The T_{c}-x phase boundary (dark gray area) separates the superconducting phase (SC) from the normal phase. The value of T_{c} from \rho(T) was defined by the temperature where \rho drops to 50% of its normal state value and vertical bars indicate the temperatures where the electrical resistivity drops to 90% and 10% of its normal state value. Values of T_{c} from Y_{dc} and Y_{dc} were defined by the onset of the superconducting transition. The dashed line indicates another possible upper bound for the SC region.

Figure 12: (Color online) Specific heat C divided by temperature T, C/T, vs T for La_{0.85}Th_{0.15}OBiS_{2}. C/T vs T^{2} is shown in the inset in the upper left hand part of the figure. The red line is a fit of the expression C(T)=\gamma\,T+\beta T^{3} to the data that yields \gamma=0.58 mJ/mol f.u. K^{2} and \Theta_{D}=220 K. The inset in the lower right part of the figure shows a plot of C_{c}/T vs T, where C_{c}/T is the electronic contribution to the specific heat, in the vicinity of the superconducting transition. An idealized entropy conserving construction yields T_{c}=2.5 K and \Delta C/\gamma\,T_{c}=0.91.

 is a small feature around the T_{c} obtained from the electrical resistivity (T_{c} = 2.36 K) as indicated by an arrow in the lower right-hand side of the figure. The absence of a well-defined superconducting jump at T_{c} is probably a consequence of the superconducting transition being spread out in temperature due to sample inhomogeneity.

There is an upturn in specific heat below roughly 1.2 and 0.9 K for the La_{0.8}Hf_{0.2}OBiS_{2} and La_{0.85}Ta_{0.15}OBiS_{2} samples, respectively. The same kind of upturn is also seen in Sr_{0.5}La_{0.5}FBiS_{2} at a similar temperature.[45] This upturn may be a contribution to specific heat from a Schottky anomaly or may be indicative of a second superconducting phase in this compound. However, measurements must be made at temperatures below 0.36 K to unambiguously clarify the nature of this feature.

## IV Discussion

The results from \rho(T), \chi_{\rm dc}, and \chi_{\rm ac} measurements are summarized in a phase diagram of T_{c} vs. Th concentration x shown in Fig. 14. T_{c}(x) decreases with x from 2.85 K at x = 0.15 to 2.05 K at x = 0.20 and exhibits roughly concentration-independent behavior at higher concentration. The superconducting region may be defined by the dark gray region in Fig. 14, and apparently lacks a domelike character typically seen for both the high-T_{c} layered cuprate and Fe-pnictide superconductors. Domelike superconductor regions are also seen in LaO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2} and NdO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2}.[69] At concentrations below the SC domes in these compounds, electrical resistivity measurements reveal bad metal or semiconducting-like behavior. These results are in agreement with first-principles calculations,[33] which suggest that the density of states at the Fermi level increases with increasing electron doping, such that the insulating parent compound becomes metallic. This effect is expected to be maximal at half-filling (x = 0.5). The LaO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2} system[6] shows a maximum T_{c} for x = 0.5, while the NdO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2}[9] system exhibits its highest T_{c} at x = 0.3. Other scenarios may be possible depending on how we define the SC region because of the broadness of the superconducting transitions. For example, a dashed line is also shown in Fig. 14 that mostly resides within the ranges characterized by the transition. In order to better define the phase boundary, studies on samples with sharper transitions would be beneficial.

A similar result can be seen in Fig. 15 where the highest T_{c}(x) is observed at x = 0.2 for Hf, Zr, and Ti doping. T_{c}(x) decreases initially with increasing x and then becomes concentration independent. The character of T_{c}(x) observed for La_{1-x}M_{x}OBiS_{2} and displayed in the phase diagram suggests that the superconducting state is similar for these systems. Considering other examples of inducing superconductivity by electron doping such as in LaO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2}.[4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] and Sr_{1-x}La_{x}FBiS_{2},[43] our results suggest that electron doping is a viable approach to induce superconductivity in BiS_{2}-based compounds.

## V Concluding Remarks

In summary, we have synthesized polycrystalline samples of La_{1-x}M_{x}OBiS_{2} (M = Th, Hf, Zr, Ti, and Sr) with the CeOBiS_{2} crystal structure. Electrical resistivity, dc and ac magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat measurements were performed on selected samples. Electron doping via substitution of tetravalent Th^{+4}, Hf^{+4}, Zr^{+4}, Ti^{+4} for trivalent La^{+3} induces superconductivity while hole doping via substitution of divalent Sr^{+2} for La^{+3} does not. These results strongly suggest that electron doping by almost any means may be sufficient to induce superconductivity in BiS_{2}-based compounds.

###### Abstract

We report a strategy to induce superconductivity in the BiS_{2}-based compound LaOBiS_{2}. Instead of substituting F for O, we increase the charge-carrier density (electron dope) via substitution of tetravalent Th^{+4}, Hf^{+4}, Zr^{+4}, and Ti^{+4} for trivalent La^{+3}. It is found that both the LaOBiS_{2} and ThOBiS_{2} parent compounds are bad metals and that superconductivity is induced by electron doping with T_{c} values of up to 2.85 K. The superconducting and normal states were characterized by electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity measurements. We also demonstrate that reducing the charge-carrier density (hole doping) via substitution of divalent Sr^{+2} for La^{+3} does not induce superconductivity.

## I Introduction

Superconductivity with T_{c} = 8.6 K has recently been reported in the layered compound Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}.[1, 2] Following this report, several other BiS_{2}-based superconductors, including LnO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2} (Ln = La_{4}, Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb) with T_{c} as high as 10 K, have been synthesized and studied.[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] These materials have a layered crystal structure composed of superconducting BiS_{2} layers and blocking layers of Bi_{4}O_{4}(SO_{4})_{1-x} for Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} and LnO for LnO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2} (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Yb). This structural configuration is similar to the situation encountered in the high-T_{c} layered cuprate and Fe-pnictide superconductors in which superconductivity primarily resides in CuO_{2} planes and Fe-pnictide layers, respectively.[13, 14, 15, 16, 17] Even though BiS_{2}-based superconductors share a similar crystal structure with Fe-pnictide superconductors, they exhibit some important differences. The undoped parent compounds, LnFeAsO, display a spin density wave (SDW) or a structural instability near 150 K.[15, 16, 17] Superconductivity emerges when the SDW is suppressed towards zero temperature either through charge carrier doping or application of pressure.[18]T_{c} is raised as high as 55 K by replacement of La by other rare-earth elements such as Sm.[15, 16] In contrast, the phosphorus-based analogues LnFePO do not show a SDW transition or structural instability but still exhibit superconductivity.[19, 20] For LaFePO, values of T_{c} that range from 3 to 7 K,[20, 21] without charge carrier doping, have been reported. Both LnFeAsO and LnFePO remain metallic to low temperatures, while the undoped parent compounds LnOBiS_{2} are bad metals. It has been suggested that superconductivity emerges in close proximity to an insulating normal state for the optimal superconducting sample.[11]

Several distinct examples of chemical substitution have been found to induce superconductivity in LnFeAsO compounds including substituting F for O,[12, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27] Co for Fe,[28] Sr for La,[29] Th for Gd,[30] and also the introduction of oxygen vacancies.[31, 32] Substituting F for O induces superconductivity in BiS_{2}-based superconductors.[33, 34, 35, 36, 34, 36, 34, 33] To determine whether superconductivity might emerge under other conditions, we chose to dope electrons via chemical substitution on the La site in LaOBiS_{2}. In this study, we demonstrate that substitution of tetravalent Th^{+4}, Hf^{+4}, Zr^{+4}, and Ti^{+4} for trivalent La^{+3} in LaOBiS_{2} induces superconductivity. We also observed that substitution of divalent Sr^{+2} for La^{+3} (hole doping) does not induce superconductivity.

## II Experimental Methods

Polycrystalline samples of La_{1-x}Th_{x}OBiS_{2}(0 \leqslant x \leqslant 1), La_{1-x}Hf_{x}OBiS_{2}(0 \leqslant x \leqslant 0.4), La_{1-x}Zr_{x}OBiS_{2}(0 \leqslant x \leqslant 0.3), and La_{1-x}Sr_{x}OBiS_{2}(0 \leqslant x \leqslant 0.3), (0 \leqslant x \leqslant 0.3) were prepared by a two-step solid state reaction method using high-purity starting materials. Initially, the Bi_{2}S_{3} precursor powders were prepared by reacting Bi and S grains together at 500 degC in an evacuated quartz tube for 10 hours. Starting materials of La, La_{2}O_{3}, S, and Bi_{2}S_{3} powders and either M = Th or Ti chunks, Hf granules, or Zr foil, were weighed in stoichiometric ratios based on nominal concentrations La_{1-x}M_{x}BiS_{2} (M = Th, Hf, Zr, Ti). Next, they were thoroughly mixed, pressed into pellets, sealed in evacuated quartz tubes, and annealed at 865^{<}C for 72 hours. Additional regrinding and sintering at 700^{<}C for 3 days was performed to promote phase homogeneity. The crystal structure was verified by means of x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 Discover x-ray diffractometer with Cu-K_{\alpha} radiation. The resulting XRD patterns were fitted via Rietveld refinement[37] using the gsas+expgui software package.[38, 39] The chemical composition was investigated by means of energy dispersive x rays (EDX) using a FEI Quanta 600 scanning electron microscope equipped with an INCA EDX detector from Oxford instruments. Electrical resistivity measurements were performed using a home-built probe in a liquid ^{4}He Dewar for temperatures 1 K \leqslantT\leqslant 300 K by means of a standard four-wire technique using a Linear Research LR700 ac resistance bridge. Magnetization measurements were made for 2 K \leqslantT\leqslant 300 K and in magnetic fields H = 5 Oe using a Quantum Design MPMS. Alternating current magnetic susceptibility was measured down to \sim1 K in a liquid ^{4}He Dewar. Specific heat measurements and electrical resistivity measurements under applied magnetic  field for La_{0.85}Th_{0.15}OBiS_{2} and La_{0.8}Hf_{0.2}OBiS_{2} samples were performed for 0.36 K \leqslantT\leqslant 30 K in a Quantum Design PPMS DynaCool with a ^{3}He insert using a thermal relaxation technique.

## III Results

### Crystal structure and sample quality

Figure 1 shows the powder XRD patterns of LaOBiS_{2} and ThOBiS_{2} samples. Overall, the main diffraction peaks of these two samples can be well indexed to a tetragonal structure with space group P4/mmn. The crystal structure has previously been designated as having the ZrCuSiAs type structure,[3, 4, 5, 5] however, the CeOBiS_{2} type structure may be a more appropriate structure assignment.[11] While the crystal structure of LaOBiS_{2} and ThOBiS_{2} has a different Wyckoff sequence than that of ZrCuSiAs, it has the same Wyckoff sequence and positions, and similar unit cell parameter ratios (c/a) as the crystal structure for CeOBiS_{2}.[40] The crystallographic data for ThOBiS_{2} obtained from Reitveld refinement of the powder XRD pattern given in Fig. 1 are tabulated in Table 1. The inset of Fig. 2(a), displays the crystal structure of LaOBiS_{2}. The structure is composed of stacked La_{2}O_{2} layers and two BiS_{2} layers in each unit cell. To dope electrons into the BiS_{2} conduction layers, we substituted tetravalent Th^{+4}, Hf^{+4}, Zr^{+4}, and Ti^{+4} for La^{+3} and to dope holes into the BiS_{2} conduction layers, we substituted divalent Sr^{+2} for trivalent La^{+3}. We find that samples for the entire range of Th substitutions below the solubility limit, Hf substitutions in the range 0.1 \leqslantx\leqslant 0.4, and Zr, Ti, and Sr substitutions in the range 0.1 \leqslantx\leqslant 0.3 can be described by the same space group. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the lattice parameters a and c for La_{1-x}Th_{x}OBiS_{2}(0 \leqslantx\leqslant 1) decrease with increasing Th concentration, although the relative decrease of a is much smaller than that of c. With Th doping, the positions of Bragg reflections shift systematically. For example, the (004) reflections shift to higher angles, consistent with a decrease of c. This result indicates that Th is really incorporated into the lattice; although, some amounts of elemental Bi and/or Bi_{2}S_{3} separate from the lattice, indicated by arrows in Figs. 1

  and 2(a). We could not always distinguish between whether the impurity phase was Bi or Bi_{2}S_{3}, since their Bragg reflections occur at very similar positions. If the impurity is assumed to be Bi, the amount is between 3% to 15% by mass and if the impurity is assumed to be Bi_{2}S_{3}, the amount is between 5% to 18% by mass. In either case, the ratio increases with increasing Th concentration. If the impurity is Bi, there should be other La-S-O based impurities, but we could not detect any elemental S or La impurities or binary compounds made from La-S-O. The impurity is therefore likely Bi_{2}S_{3}, which should be balanced with a La_{2}O_{3} impurity. Unfortunately, the Bragg reflections of La_{2}O_{3} overlap with the main phase peak positions, which makes it difficult to estimate the impurity ratio of La_{2}O_{3} using Rietveld refinement. For 0.5\leqslant x\leqslant 0.9, the lattice parameters (not shown) are close to the lattice parameters of ThOBiS_{2} and do not change appreciably with x. The impurity amount increases with x and other impurity peaks begin to appear in this region, indicating the probable existence of a solubility limit of La/Th near x=0.45.

More direct evidence of Th incorporation into the lattice comes from chemical composition measurements by energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) microanalysis. The EDX spectrum was collected from a single grain. Quantitative analysis for selected samples gives La:Th ratios of 0.08, 0.12, 0.18, and 0.24 for the samples with nominal ratios 0.1, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.25, respectively. This result demonstrates that most of the Th was successfully doped into the samples.

For the Hf, Zr, and Ti substitutions, the powder XRD patterns and lattice parameters a and c are given for La_{1-x}M_{x}OBiS_{2} with M= Hf, Zr, Ti, Sr and x=0.2 in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. The lattice parameters a and c exhibit behavior similar to Th substitution, wherein the c lattice parameter decreases with increasing Hf, Zr, and Ti concentration and the a lattice parameter does not show an appreciable concentration dependence. For Sr substitution, the a lattice parameter increases slightly, while c decreases with increasing Sr concentration. Even though the ionic size of Th is bigger than the others (Hf, Zr, and Ti), the c lattice parameters are very close to each other. The decrease of the c axis may be attributed to a strengthening of the interlayer bonding as a consequence of doping.

### Electrical resistivity

Electrical resistivity \rho(T) data, normalized by the value of \rho at 290 K, are shown in Fig. 4 for the pure LaOBiS_{2} and ThOBiS_{2} samples. For both compounds, \rho initially decreases with decreasing temperature, exhibits a minimum at T=220 and 206 K, respectively, and then shows semiconductor-like behavior down to the lowest temperatures measured. For the La_{1-x}Th_{x}OBiS_{2} system, the minimum in \rho is suppressed for x=0.1, and \rho(T) exhibits relatively strong temperature dependence and an inflection point (indicated by an arrow) as shown in Fig. 4(b). For x=0.15, this feature disappears and \rho drops to zero below T_{c}=2.85 K. \rho(T) becomes less temperature dependent for 0.15\leqslant x\leqslant 0.45 and increases with decreasing temperature until the onset of superconductivity. First-principles calculations have suggested that there may be a charge density wave instability or enhanced correlations in the LaO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2} system.[33] We are unable to unambiguously observe such an instability from the electrical resistivity measurements in this study. However, the inflection point could be related to such an effect.

Electrical resistivity measurements for La_{1-x}Hf_{x}OBiS_{2}, La_{1-x}Zr_{x}OBiS_{2}, and La_{1-x}Ti_{x}OBiS_{2} samples are shown in Figs. 5-7, respectively. Resistive superconducting transition curves for these systems are indicated in the right inset

(b) \rho, normalized by its value at 290 K, vs T for La_{1-x}Th_{x}OBiS_{2}(0\leqslant x\leqslant 1). (c) \rho, normalized to its value in the normal state at 5 K, vs T emphasizing the transition into the superconducting state.

  of Figs. 5-6 and in Fig. 7(c). All of these doping studies show similar characteristics such as an inflection point anomaly in the normal state with low concentration and induced superconductivity for concentrations starting with x=0.15 for La_{1-x}Th_{x}OBiS_{2} and x=0.2 for La_{1-x}Hf_{x}OBiS_{2}, La_{1-x}Zr_{x}OBiS_{2}, and La_{1-x}Ti_{x}OBiS_{2}. Furthermore, all of these systems show semiconductor-like behavior in the normal state. The inflection point in \rho of samples with low concentration is emphasized in the left inset of Figs. 5 and 6, and in Fig. 7(b) where the anomaly is indicated by an arrow. These anomalies all appear to be present at a common temperature of roughly 120 K in concentrations x just below those where superconductivity is induced. To compare the superconducting transition temperatures (T_{c}), we consider data for 20% substitution of La by Th, Hf, Zr, and Ti in Fig. 8(a). The superconducting transition temperatures, as shown in Fig. 8(b), are characterized by the temperatures where the electrical resistivity drops to 50% of the normal state resistivity, and the width of the transition is determined by the temperatures where the resistivity drops to 90% and 10% of the normal state resistivity. Electron doping clearly induces superconductivity in LaOBiS_{2}. The T_{c}'s are quite similar to one another, but the transition width is sharper for La_{0.8}Hf_{0.2}OBiS_{2} and La_{0.8}Ti_{0.2}OBiS_{2} than for La_{0.8}Zr_{0.2}OBiS_{2} and La_{0.8}Th_{0.2}OBiS_{2}. The lowest T_{c} is seen in La_{0.8}Zr_{0.2}OBiS_{2}. There does not appear to be a clear correlation between T_{c} and the lattice parameters. Meanwhile, Fig. 9 shows \rho(T) measurements for La_{1-x}Sr_{x}OBiS_{2} wherein no evidence of a superconducting transition is observed down to \sim1 K in the range 0.1\leq x\leq 0.3. This result suggests that hole doping is not sufficient to induce superconductivity. It is, however, interesting to note that the magnitude of \rho at low temperatures increases with increasing Sr concentration, which is similar to the behavior observed with Th, Hf, Zr, and Ti doping.

  The temperature dependence of \rho, normalized by its value at 5 K for La0.85Tb0.15OBiS2 and La0.8Hf0.2OBiS2 samples, is shown in Figs. 10(a) and 10(b), respectively, under several applied magnetic fields (H = 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1, and 9 T) down to 0.36 K. Both samples undergo relatively sharp superconducting transitions at T_{c} = 2.85 and 2.40 K for La0.8Tb0.2OBiS2 and La0.8Hf0.2OBiS2, respectively. With increasing magnetic field, the transition width broadens and the onset of superconductivity gradually shifts to lower temperatures. Similar broadening of the transition was observed in the high-T_{c} layered cuprate and Fe-pnictide superconductors and attributed to the vortex-liquid state.[34, 41] Figures 10(c) and 10(d) show the upper critical field H_{c} versus T for La0.85Tb0.15OBiS2 and La0.8Hf0.2OBiS2 samples, corresponding to the temperatures where the resistivity drops to 90% of the normal state resistivity \rho_{\rm{t}}(T,H) (T_{c,{\rm{onset}}}), 50% of \rho_{\rm{t}}(T,H) (T_{c}), and 10% of \rho_{\rm{t}}(T,H) (T_{c,{\rm{zero}}}) in applied magnetic fields. Using the conventional one-band Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory,[42] the orbital critical fields H_{c2}(0) for La0.85Tb0.15OBiS2 and La0.8Hf0.2OBiS2 compounds were inferred from their initial slopes of H_{c} with respect to T, yielding values of 1.09 and 1.12 T, respectively. These values of H_{c2}(0) are very close to the values seen in Sr1-1.2La_{x}FBiS2 (1.04 T)[43] and La0.85Tb0.5BiS2 (1.9 T),[8] suggesting that the superconducting state in BiS2-based superconductors probably shares a common character.

### Magnetization

To determine whether superconductivity is a bulk phenomenon in La1-xM_{\rm{x}}OBiS2, zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) measurements of the magnetic susceptibility \chi_{\rm{dc}}(T) were made in a magnetic field of 5 Oe for the La0.85Tb0.15OBiS2 and La0.8Hf0.2OBiS2 samples. These measurements are plotted in Figs. 11(a) and 11(c). ZFC measurements yield diamagnetic screening signals with T_{c} onset values that are lower than values obtained from \rho(T) data, while FC measurements reveal evidence for strong vortex pinning. Alternating current magnetic susceptibility measurements for La0.85Tb0.15OBiS2 and La0.8Hf0.2OBiS2 samples are shown in Figs. 11(b) and 11(d), respectively. These data exhibit signatures of SC with slightly lower T_{c}'s than those observed in \rho and \chi_{\rm{dc}} measurements. It is clear that, even though the superconducting transition is incomplete at 1.3 K, the volume fractions are \sim67% and \sim16% for La0.85Tb0.15OBiS2 and La0.8Hf0.2OBiS2 samples, respectively, according to the ac magnetic susceptibility measurements.

The temperature corresponding to the 50% normal state \rho is also shown.

  

### Specific heat

Specific heat data for La_{0.85}Th_{0.15}OBiS_{2} and La_{0.8}Hf_{0.2}OBiS_{2} samples are displayed in Figs. 12 and 13, respectively. The data for La_{0.85}Th_{0.15}OBiS_{2} cover the temperature range 0.36 to 30 K. A fit of the expression C(T)=\gamma\,T+\beta T^{3} to the data in the normal state, where \gamma is the electronic specific heat coefficient and \beta is the coefficient of the lattice contribution, is plotted as a function of T^{2} in the inset in the upper left-hand side of Fig. 12. From the best fit, which is explicitly indicated by a line in the inset, we obtain values of \gamma=0.58 mJ/mol f.u. K^{2} and \beta=0.91 mJ/mol f.u. K^{4}; the value of \beta corresponds to a Debye temperature of \Theta_{D}=220 K. In the inset in the lower right-hand side of Fig. 12, C_{c}/T versus T is plotted. A clear feature is observed between 1 and 3 K. If this feature is related to the transition into the superconducting state, we can estimate T_{c}=2.5 K from an idealized entropy conserving construction. This value of T_{c} is close to the temperature obtained from the electrical resistivity (T_{c}=2.85 K). The presence of the feature may suggest that superconductivity is a bulk phenomenon in this compound. The ratio of the specific heat jump to \gamma\,T_{c}, \Delta C/\gamma\,T_{c}=0.91, was calculated using a jump in C_{c}/T of 0.53 mJ/mol f.u. K^{2}, extracted from the entropy conserving construction as seen in the inset in the lower right-hand side of the figure. This value is less than the value of 1.43 predicted by the BCS theory, but is similar to that seen in LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}.[12]

The specific heat data for La_{0.8}Hf_{0.2}OBiS_{2} are displayed between 0.36 and 30 K in Fig. 13. The upper inset of Fig. 13 highlights the linear fit to the C/T data plotted versus T^{2}, from which we extracted \gamma=2.12 mJ/mol f.u. K^{2} and \beta=0.82 mJ/mol f.u. K^{4} and calculated \Theta_{D}=228 K. In the inset in the lower right-hand side of the figure, the electronic contribution to the specific heat C_{c}/T versus T is shown, which has been obtained by subtracting the lattice contribution \beta T^{3} from C(T). Absent from these data is any clear evidence for a jump at the T_{c} obtained from either the electrical resistivity or dc and ac magnetic susceptibility (T_{c}=2.36, 2.81, and 1.42 K, respectively) measurements. However, there

Figure 14: (Color online) (a) Superconducting transition temperature T_{c} vs Th concentration x phase diagram for the La_{1-x}Th_{x}OBiS_{2} system. The phase diagram is constructed from electrical resistivity \rho (filled triangles), dc magnetic susceptibility Y_{dc} (filled diamonds), and ac magnetic susceptibility X_{ac} (filled circles) measurements. The T_{c}-x phase boundary (dark gray area) separates the superconducting phase (SC) from the normal phase. The value of T_{c} from \rho(T) was defined by the temperature where \rho drops to 50% of its normal state value and vertical bars indicate the temperatures where the electrical resistivity drops to 90% and 10% of its normal state value. Values of T_{c} from Y_{dc} and Y_{dc} were defined by the onset of the superconducting transition. The dashed line indicates another possible upper bound for the SC region.

Figure 12: (Color online) Specific heat C divided by temperature T, C/T, vs T for La_{0.85}Th_{0.15}OBiS_{2}. C/T vs T^{2} is shown in the inset in the upper left hand part of the figure. The red line is a fit of the expression C(T)=\gamma\,T+\beta T^{3} to the data that yields \gamma=0.58 mJ/mol f.u. K^{2} and \Theta_{D}=220 K. The inset in the lower right part of the figure shows a plot of C_{c}/T vs T, where C_{c}/T is the electronic contribution to the specific heat, in the vicinity of the superconducting transition. An idealized entropy conserving construction yields T_{c}=2.5 K and \Delta C/\gamma\,T_{c}=0.91.

 is a small feature around the T_{c} obtained from the electrical resistivity (T_{c} = 2.36 K) as indicated by an arrow in the lower right-hand side of the figure. The absence of a well-defined superconducting jump at T_{c} is probably a consequence of the superconducting transition being spread out in temperature due to sample inhomogeneity.

There is an upturn in specific heat below roughly 1.2 and 0.9 K for the La_{0.8}Hf_{0.2}OBiS_{2} and La_{0.85}Ta_{0.15}OBiS_{2} samples, respectively. The same kind of upturn is also seen in Sr_{0.5}La_{0.5}FBiS_{2} at a similar temperature.[45] This upturn may be a contribution to specific heat from a Schottky anomaly or may be indicative of a second superconducting phase in this compound. However, measurements must be made at temperatures below 0.36 K to unambiguously clarify the nature of this feature.

## IV Discussion

The results from \rho(T), \chi_{\rm dc}, and \chi_{\rm ac} measurements are summarized in a phase diagram of T_{c} vs. Th concentration x shown in Fig. 14. T_{c}(x) decreases with x from 2.85 K at x = 0.15 to 2.05 K at x = 0.20 and exhibits roughly concentration-independent behavior at higher concentration. The superconducting region may be defined by the dark gray region in Fig. 14, and apparently lacks a domelike character typically seen for both the high-T_{c} layered cuprate and Fe-pnictide superconductors. Domelike superconductor regions are also seen in LaO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2} and NdO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2}.[69] At concentrations below the SC domes in these compounds, electrical resistivity measurements reveal bad metal or semiconducting-like behavior. These results are in agreement with first-principles calculations,[33] which suggest that the density of states at the Fermi level increases with increasing electron doping, such that the insulating parent compound becomes metallic. This effect is expected to be maximal at half-filling (x = 0.5). The LaO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2} system[6] shows a maximum T_{c} for x = 0.5, while the NdO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2}[9] system exhibits its highest T_{c} at x = 0.3. Other scenarios may be possible depending on how we define the SC region because of the broadness of the superconducting transitions. For example, a dashed line is also shown in Fig. 14 that mostly resides within the ranges characterized by the transition. In order to better define the phase boundary, studies on samples with sharper transitions would be beneficial.

A similar result can be seen in Fig. 15 where the highest T_{c}(x) is observed at x = 0.2 for Hf, Zr, and Ti doping. T_{c}(x) decreases initially with increasing x and then becomes concentration independent. The character of T_{c}(x) observed for La_{1-x}M_{x}OBiS_{2} and displayed in the phase diagram suggests that the superconducting state is similar for these systems. Considering other examples of inducing superconductivity by electron doping such as in LaO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2}.[4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] and Sr_{1-x}La_{x}FBiS_{2},[43] our results suggest that electron doping is a viable approach to induce superconductivity in BiS_{2}-based compounds.

## V Concluding Remarks

In summary, we have synthesized polycrystalline samples of La_{1-x}M_{x}OBiS_{2} (M = Th, Hf, Zr, Ti, and Sr) with the CeOBiS_{2} crystal structure. Electrical resistivity, dc and ac magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat measurements were performed on selected samples. Electron doping via substitution of tetravalent Th^{+4}, Hf^{+4}, Zr^{+4}, Ti^{+4} for trivalent La^{+3} induces superconductivity while hole doping via substitution of divalent Sr^{+2} for La^{+3} does not. These results strongly suggest that electron doping by almost any means may be sufficient to induce superconductivity in BiS_{2}-based compounds.
