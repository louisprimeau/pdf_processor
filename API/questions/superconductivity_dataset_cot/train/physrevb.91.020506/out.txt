###### Abstract

Following the discovery of superconductivity in quasi-one-dimensional K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} containing [(Cr_{3}As_{3})^{2}]-\infty chains (J. K. Bao _et al._, arXiv:1412.0067), we succeeded in synthesizing an analogous compound, Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}, which also crystallizes in a hexagonal lattice. The replacement of K by Rb results in an expansion of the a axis by 3%, indicating a weaker interchain coupling in Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}. Bulk superconductivity emerges at 4.8 K, above which the normal-state resistivity shows a linear temperature dependence up to 35 K. The estimated upper critical field at zero temperature exceeds the Pauli paramagnetic limit by a factor of 2. Furthermore, the electronic specific-heat coefficient extrapolated to zero temperature in the mixed state increases with \sqrt{H}, suggesting the existence of nodes in the superconducting energy gap. Hence Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} manifests itself as another example of an unconventional superconductor in the Cr_{3}As_{3}-chain based system.

## I Introduction

Superconductivity (SC) infrequently appears in quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) crystalline materials primarily because of the Peierls instability towards a state of the charge-density wave [1, 2]. An additional disadvantage of Q1D systems for SC may come from the possible realization of a Luttinger liquid, as well as the reduced density of states when the Fermi level (E_{\rm F}) does not incidentally locate at the van Hove singularities. Nevertheless, 1D systems have long been studied theoretically [3] owing to their inherent simplicity and, the discovery of SC in Q1D Bechgaard salts [4] has attracted sustained research interest [5]. Examples of inorganic Q1D superconductors include Li_{0.9}Mo_{6}O_{7}[6] and Tl_{2}Mo_{6}Se_{6}[7], in which the Mo 4d electrons bear relatively weak electron correlations. Nevertheless, peculiar properties were revealed in Li_{0.9}Mo_{6}O_{17}[8, 9, 10], and a possible triplet SC was proposed [11].

Very recently, we discovered bulk SC at 6.1 K in a Q1D pnictide K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} in which correlated Cr 3d electrons are involved [12]. The crystal structure is characterized by [Cr_{3}As_{3}^{2}]-\infty double-walled subnanotubes in which Cr_{6/2}(As_{6/2}) face-sharing octahedron chains constitute the inner (outer) wall. The intrachain Cr-Cr bond distances (2.6-2.7 A) are close to those in Cr metal, indicating a dominant metallic bonding along the chain direction. In comparison, the shortest interchain Cr-Cr distance is as large as 7.3 A, and a much weaker (if not negligible) interchain overlap of Cr 3d orbitals is expected. Thus, the material is really Q1D, at least in the sense of chemical bonding as well as crystal structure. This material hosts a series of peculiar physical properties including a large Sommerfeld coefficient of 70-75 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1}, a linear temperature dependence of resistivity from 7 to 300 K, and high upper critical fields exceeding the Pauli limit by a factor over 3. The first-principles calculations [13] indicate that the electrons around E_{\rm F} are dominated by the Cr 3d states, which form two Q1D Fermi surface (FS) sheets and one three-dimensional (3D) FS pocket. The calculated "bare" density of state (DOS) at E_{\rm F} is less than 1/3 of the experimental value from the specific-heat measurement, confirming the electron correlation effect. In addition, ferromagnetic instability and/or ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are revealed, which favor spin-triplet Cooper pairing. These experimental and theoretical-calculation results suggest unconventional SC in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}.

In Q1D systems, the interchain coupling plays a crucial role in the competition between SC and the charge- or spin-density wave. For example, unlike Tl_{2}Mo_{6}Se_{6}, which remains metallic and superconducts at 4.2 K [14], Rb_{2}Mo_{6}Se_{6} undergoes a metal-insulator transition at \sim170 K, which is explained in terms of a dynamical charge-density wave owing to the reduced interchain hopping [14]. Thus, the appearance of SC in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} suggests a significant interchain coupling, as revealed by the existence of 3D FSs. Therefore, it is of considerable interest to investigate the effect of interchain coupling by the elemental replacement (e.g., Rb for K) in the spacer columns. Furthermore, it is important to check whether the unconventional SC is a common feature in Q1D Cr-based pnictides.

In this Rapid Communication, we report the synthesis, structural characterization, and physical property measurement of an analogous material, Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}. Indeed, a weaker interchain coupling is signatured by the obviously expanded interchain distance. Nevertheless, bulk superconductivity at a little lowered temperature of 4.8 K was observed, accompanied with a mildly reduced Sommerfeld coefficient of 55 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1}. Remarkably, unconventional SC is evidenced by the electrical transport and the thermodynamic properties.

The Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} polycrystalline sample was synthesized by solid-state reactions in a sealed vacuum. First, the starting materials (Rb piece, Cr powder, and As piece), all of high purity (\geqslant 99.9%, Alfa Aesar), were weighed in a nearly stoichiometric ratio (with 3% excess of Rb in order to compensate for the loss of Rb in the process of the solid-state reaction), and the mixture was loaded in a quartz ampoule. The quartz ampoule was evacuated (<10^{-2} Pa) and sealed, followed by slowly heating in a muffle furnace to 523 K for 15 h. After the first stage reaction, the mixture was homogenized by grinding, pressed into pellets, and put into an alumina tube which was then sealed by arc welding in argon atmosphere in a Ta tube. The sealed Ta tube, jacketed by an evacuated quartz ampoule, was then sintered at 973 K for 24 h. This procedure was repeated to allow a full solid-state reaction. The obtained sample was sensitive to air, and it should not be exposed to air as much as possible. Note that all the operations of weighing, mixing, grinding, pelletizing, etc., were carried out in an argon-filled glove box with a water and oxygen contents of less than 0.1 ppm.

Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out at room temperature on a PANalytical x-ray diffractometer (Model EMPYREAN) with monochromatic CuK\alpha_{1} radiation. To avoid exposure to air, the sample powder was mixed with a small amount of Apiezon N grease before putting on the sample holder, and the sample was in vacuum during the XRD data collection. The crystal structure parameters were refined based on the K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5}-type structure [12] by a Rietveld analysis with the code rietan-fp[15]. Note that the XRD data of 2\theta = 8^{\circ}-25^{\circ} were not included for the refinement to avoid the extrinsic influence from the N grease.

We conducted the electrical, magnetic, and heat capacity measurements on a physical property measurement system (Quantum Design, PPMS-9) and a magnetic property measurement system (Quantum Design, MPMS-5). The electrical resistivity was measured using a standard four-electrode method. The as-prepared Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5} pellet was cut into a thin rectangular bar, and gold wires were attached onto the sample's surface with silver paint. The heat capacity was measured by a thermal relaxation method using a square-shaped sample plate (9.0 mg). The temperature dependence of dc magnetic susceptibility was measured in the protocols of zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) under a field of 10 Oe. The dc magnetization was also measured as a function of magnetic field at 2 K.

Figure 1 shows the XRD profile of the Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5} sample. The reflections can be well indexed by a hexagonal unit cell whose size is slightly larger than that of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5}, and no obvious impurity phase can be identified. The Rietveld refinement was successful, and the resulting structural parameters are listed in Table 1. Compared with K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5}, the a axis is 3.0% larger, while the c axis is expanded by only 0.28%. Since the a axis just measures the interchain distance [see the inset of Fig. 1(b)], one may expect a weaker interchain interaction in Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5}. This is further revealed by the enlargement of the hretarchian Cr-Cr distance (from 7.30 A in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5} to 7.63 A in Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5}), while the average Cr-Cr bond distance remains almost unchanged. Also, the [(Cr_{3}As_{5})^{2-}]_{\infty} column itself suffers significant modifications. The Cr2-Cr2 bond distance of the Cr2 triangle in the z=0 plane _decreases_ by 4.5%, and the Cr1-Cr1 bond distance in the z=0.5 plane _expands_ by 1.5%, as compared with those in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5}. Consequently, the geometry of the Cr octahedron becomes inverse.

Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of resistivity \rho(T) for the Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} polycrystalline sample. The \rho(T) shows metallic conduction and, similar to that in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}, a T-linear resistivity can also be seen, albeit in a narrow temperature range from 5 to 35 K. This indicates a non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior, if it is not an accidental phenomenon due to a "polycrystal effect" [16]. The origin of the NFL behavior could be related to a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid state [17], which is characteristic of a 1D fermion system [3, 18]. Nonetheless, superconductivity emerges below 4.8 K with a transition width \Delta T_{\rm c}=0.44 K [\Delta T_{\rm c}=T(90\%\rho_{\rm n})-T(10\%\rho_{\rm n}), where \rho_{\rm n} refers to the extrapolated normal-state resistivity at the superconducting transition midpoint]. This \Delta T_{\rm c} value is obviously larger than that (0.24 K) of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5}, which seems to be related to the relatively weak interchain coupling in Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5}. Other explanations of the broadening of superconducting transition include less inhomogeneity and/or larger stresses in the present polycrystalline sample.

Upon applying magnetic field, T_{\rm c} decreases monotonically, as shown in Fig. 2(b), from which the upper critical field H_{\rm c2} can be determined using the conventional criteria of 90%\rho_{\rm n}. The resulting H_{\rm c2} is plotted as a function of temperature in

  Fig. 2(c). The initial slope \mu_{0}(dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{\rm c}} is -5.08 T/K. If using the empirical Ginzburg-Landau relation [19], H_{c2}(T)=H_{c2}(0)(1-t^{2})/(1+t^{2}), where t denotes a reduced temperature T/T_{\rm c}, the upper critical field at zero temperature [\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)] is estimated to be \sim 20 T. Alternatively, the orbital limited upper critical field \mu_{0}H_{c0}^{\rm orb}(0) can be estimated by the Werthammer-Helfand-Hohenberg model [20, 21], which yields \mu_{0}H_{c0}^{\rm orb}(0)=-0.693T_{\rm c}(d\mu_{0}H_{c2}/dT)_{T_{\rm c}}\approx 17 T for an isotropic full superconducting gap in the dirty limit and without spin-orbit coupling. Both the \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) values exceed the Pauli paramagnetic limited upper critical field of \mu_{0}H_{\rm P}=1.84T_{\rm c}\approx 9.0 T (also for an isotropic full superconducting gap without spin-orbit coupling) [22, 23]. Note that the H_{c2}(T) data were measured on the polycrystalline sample, and one may expect a higher H_{c2}(0) for \bf H\bf|. A similar phenomenon of large H_{c2}(0) beyond the Pauli limit was reported in Q1D Li_{0.9}Mo_{6}O_{17}[10], which was regarded as evidence of spin-triplet SC [11]. For the Q1D superconductor Tl_{2}Mo_{6}Se_{6} (T_{\rm c}=4.2 K), in comparison, the measured \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) values are 5.8 and 0.47 T, respectively, for magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the c axis [14], both of which are less than the Pauli-limited upper critical field.

In order to verify whether the observed SC is of a bulk nature, we performed dc magnetic susceptibility measurements in both ZFC and FC modes under a 10 Oe magnetic field. Indeed, a superconducting diamagnetic transition can be seen at T_{\rm c}=4.8 K in Fig. 3(a). The volume fraction of magnetic shielding scaled by 4\pi\chi_{\rm ZFC} is 91% at 2 K after the correction of the demagnetization effect, suggesting bulk SC. In contrast, the volume fraction of magnetic repulsion (4\pi\chi_{\rm FC}) is merely 1.6%. This could be due to the magnetic flux pinning in the process of cooling down under magnetic fields. It is also noted that the diamagnetic transition width is significantly broadened, compared with K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}[12], consistent with the above resistivity measurement result. Figure 3(b) shows the field dependence of magnetization at 2 K, indicating an extreme type-II SC with a very small lower critical field (below 40 Oe). The magnetic flux pinning effect is evident from the magnetic hysteresis loop.

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of specific heat [C(T)] in the low-T regime, plotted in a C/T vs T^{2} scale. In a short temperature range from 4.8 to 6 K, the C/T vs T^{2} is essentially linear, and the linear fit with a formula C/T=\gamma_{\rm h}+\beta T^{2} yields an intersect of \gamma_{\rm h}=55.1 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} and a slope of \beta=2.9 mJ K^{-4} mol^{-1}. The \gamma_{\rm h} value refers to the normal-state Sommerfeld coefficient, which is lower but comparable to that of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} (70-75 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1}) [12]. With the fitted \beta value, and using the formula \delta_{\rm D}=[(12/5)N\,R\pi^{4}/g]^{1/3}, the Debye temperature can be calculated to be 175 K, which is reasonably smaller than that in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} (215-218 K).

Bulk SC is further confirmed by the characteristic specific-heat jump [\Delta(C)] below 4.8 K. In general, the phonon contribution to the specific heat in the superconducting state

\begin{tabular}{l c c}  & K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} [Å = K [12] and Rb (present work)]. The atomic coordinates are as follows: As1 (x, -x,0); As2 (x, -x,0.5); Cr1 (x, -x,0.5); Cr2 (x, -x,0); A1 (x, -x,0.5); A2 (1/3,2/3,0). T_{\rm c}, \Delta T_{\rm c}, H_{c2}, \gamma_{\rm h}, \delta_{\rm D}, and \Delta C denote the superconducting critical temperature, transition width, upper critical field, electronic specific-heat coefficient, Debye temperature, and dimensionless specific-heat jump, respectively.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c}  & T_{\rm c} & T_{\rm c} & T_{\rm c} \\  & &  follows the relation fitted from the normal-state C(T) data. Hence the electronic specific heat [C_{\rm e}(T)] can be obtained by the deduction of \beta T^{3} from the total C(T)[24]. The inset of Fig. 4(a) shows the obtained C_{\rm e}(T) (normalized by \gamma_{\rm u}T) as a function of temperature. By the entropy conserving construction, the thermodynamic transition temperature is determined to be 4.4 K. The dimensionless specific-heat jump at T_{\rm c} [\Delta C/(\gamma_{\rm u}T_{\rm c})] is about 1.8, substantially lower than that (2.0-2.4) in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}, which seems to be related to the reduced interchain coupling. Here we are unable to make a reasonable fit for the C_{\rm e}(T) dependence because of the limitation of the temperature range (only down to 0.43T_{\rm c}).

To examine whether the superconducting gap has nodes, we investigated the magnetic field dependence of the electronic specific heat C_{\rm e}(T,H) which gives the information about the low-energy excitations in the superconducting state. For a conventional fully gapped type-II superconductor, the excited states are basically the "normal-state quasiparticles" in the vortex cores. This generates an additional Sommerfeld coefficient of \gamma(H)\approx\frac{\hbar}{H_{c}(T)}\gamma_{\rm u} at zero temperature in the superconducting mixed state [25]. At zero field, the linear extrapolation of C/T vs T^{2} gives a "residual" Sommerfeld coefficient of \gamma_{\rm u}=5.3 mJ K^{-2}mol^{-1}, which could be either due to the existence of a small fraction (\sim 10%) of the nonsuperconducting phase, or because of the existence of quasiparticles from impurity scattering in the case of nodal superconductivity. With increasing magnetic fields, \gamma(H) increases faster than the full-gap prediction, especially at lower fields. Further, [\gamma(H)-\gamma_{\rm 0}] basically obeys the Volovik relation (i.e., \propto\sqrt{H}) [26], suggesting the presence of nodes in the superconducting gap.

It is informative to compare the two the Cr_{3}As_{3}-chain based superconductors, K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} and Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}, whose structural and physical parameters are listed in Table 1. The "anisotropic" expansion of the a axis suggests a weaker interchain coupling in Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}, which could account for the broadening of the superconducting transition and a reduced \Delta C/(\gamma_{\rm u}T_{\rm c}) value. Nevertheless, superconductivity emerges at a comparable temperature, and the variation of T_{\rm c} (decreased by 21%) basically scales with the change in \gamma_{\rm u} (decreased by 22%) which measures the DOS at E_{\rm F}. If this is not an incidental phenomenon, one may expect higher T_{\rm c} for a larger \gamma_{\rm u} value. The estimated upper critical field exceeding the Pauli limit by a factor of 2 can be a hint for spin-triplet Cooper pairing. In addition, the existence of nodes in the superconducting order parameter, as suggested by the thermodynamic analysis, does not contradict with the spin-triplet scenario. Although much work needs to be done for the details of the superconducting order parameter, the fact that the only two existing members

###### Abstract

Following the discovery of superconductivity in quasi-one-dimensional K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} containing [(Cr_{3}As_{3})^{2}]-\infty chains (J. K. Bao _et al._, arXiv:1412.0067), we succeeded in synthesizing an analogous compound, Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}, which also crystallizes in a hexagonal lattice. The replacement of K by Rb results in an expansion of the a axis by 3%, indicating a weaker interchain coupling in Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}. Bulk superconductivity emerges at 4.8 K, above which the normal-state resistivity shows a linear temperature dependence up to 35 K. The estimated upper critical field at zero temperature exceeds the Pauli paramagnetic limit by a factor of 2. Furthermore, the electronic specific-heat coefficient extrapolated to zero temperature in the mixed state increases with \sqrt{H}, suggesting the existence of nodes in the superconducting energy gap. Hence Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} manifests itself as another example of an unconventional superconductor in the Cr_{3}As_{3}-chain based system.

## I Introduction

Superconductivity (SC) infrequently appears in quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) crystalline materials primarily because of the Peierls instability towards a state of the charge-density wave [1, 2]. An additional disadvantage of Q1D systems for SC may come from the possible realization of a Luttinger liquid, as well as the reduced density of states when the Fermi level (E_{\rm F}) does not incidentally locate at the van Hove singularities. Nevertheless, 1D systems have long been studied theoretically [3] owing to their inherent simplicity and, the discovery of SC in Q1D Bechgaard salts [4] has attracted sustained research interest [5]. Examples of inorganic Q1D superconductors include Li_{0.9}Mo_{6}O_{7}[6] and Tl_{2}Mo_{6}Se_{6}[7], in which the Mo 4d electrons bear relatively weak electron correlations. Nevertheless, peculiar properties were revealed in Li_{0.9}Mo_{6}O_{17}[8, 9, 10], and a possible triplet SC was proposed [11].

Very recently, we discovered bulk SC at 6.1 K in a Q1D pnictide K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} in which correlated Cr 3d electrons are involved [12]. The crystal structure is characterized by [Cr_{3}As_{3}^{2}]-\infty double-walled subnanotubes in which Cr_{6/2}(As_{6/2}) face-sharing octahedron chains constitute the inner (outer) wall. The intrachain Cr-Cr bond distances (2.6-2.7 A) are close to those in Cr metal, indicating a dominant metallic bonding along the chain direction. In comparison, the shortest interchain Cr-Cr distance is as large as 7.3 A, and a much weaker (if not negligible) interchain overlap of Cr 3d orbitals is expected. Thus, the material is really Q1D, at least in the sense of chemical bonding as well as crystal structure. This material hosts a series of peculiar physical properties including a large Sommerfeld coefficient of 70-75 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1}, a linear temperature dependence of resistivity from 7 to 300 K, and high upper critical fields exceeding the Pauli limit by a factor over 3. The first-principles calculations [13] indicate that the electrons around E_{\rm F} are dominated by the Cr 3d states, which form two Q1D Fermi surface (FS) sheets and one three-dimensional (3D) FS pocket. The calculated "bare" density of state (DOS) at E_{\rm F} is less than 1/3 of the experimental value from the specific-heat measurement, confirming the electron correlation effect. In addition, ferromagnetic instability and/or ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are revealed, which favor spin-triplet Cooper pairing. These experimental and theoretical-calculation results suggest unconventional SC in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}.

In Q1D systems, the interchain coupling plays a crucial role in the competition between SC and the charge- or spin-density wave. For example, unlike Tl_{2}Mo_{6}Se_{6}, which remains metallic and superconducts at 4.2 K [14], Rb_{2}Mo_{6}Se_{6} undergoes a metal-insulator transition at \sim170 K, which is explained in terms of a dynamical charge-density wave owing to the reduced interchain hopping [14]. Thus, the appearance of SC in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} suggests a significant interchain coupling, as revealed by the existence of 3D FSs. Therefore, it is of considerable interest to investigate the effect of interchain coupling by the elemental replacement (e.g., Rb for K) in the spacer columns. Furthermore, it is important to check whether the unconventional SC is a common feature in Q1D Cr-based pnictides.

In this Rapid Communication, we report the synthesis, structural characterization, and physical property measurement of an analogous material, Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}. Indeed, a weaker interchain coupling is signatured by the obviously expanded interchain distance. Nevertheless, bulk superconductivity at a little lowered temperature of 4.8 K was observed, accompanied with a mildly reduced Sommerfeld coefficient of 55 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1}. Remarkably, unconventional SC is evidenced by the electrical transport and the thermodynamic properties.

The Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} polycrystalline sample was synthesized by solid-state reactions in a sealed vacuum. First, the starting materials (Rb piece, Cr powder, and As piece), all of high purity (\geqslant 99.9%, Alfa Aesar), were weighed in a nearly stoichiometric ratio (with 3% excess of Rb in order to compensate for the loss of Rb in the process of the solid-state reaction), and the mixture was loaded in a quartz ampoule. The quartz ampoule was evacuated (<10^{-2} Pa) and sealed, followed by slowly heating in a muffle furnace to 523 K for 15 h. After the first stage reaction, the mixture was homogenized by grinding, pressed into pellets, and put into an alumina tube which was then sealed by arc welding in argon atmosphere in a Ta tube. The sealed Ta tube, jacketed by an evacuated quartz ampoule, was then sintered at 973 K for 24 h. This procedure was repeated to allow a full solid-state reaction. The obtained sample was sensitive to air, and it should not be exposed to air as much as possible. Note that all the operations of weighing, mixing, grinding, pelletizing, etc., were carried out in an argon-filled glove box with a water and oxygen contents of less than 0.1 ppm.

Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out at room temperature on a PANalytical x-ray diffractometer (Model EMPYREAN) with monochromatic CuK\alpha_{1} radiation. To avoid exposure to air, the sample powder was mixed with a small amount of Apiezon N grease before putting on the sample holder, and the sample was in vacuum during the XRD data collection. The crystal structure parameters were refined based on the K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5}-type structure [12] by a Rietveld analysis with the code rietan-fp[15]. Note that the XRD data of 2\theta = 8^{\circ}-25^{\circ} were not included for the refinement to avoid the extrinsic influence from the N grease.

We conducted the electrical, magnetic, and heat capacity measurements on a physical property measurement system (Quantum Design, PPMS-9) and a magnetic property measurement system (Quantum Design, MPMS-5). The electrical resistivity was measured using a standard four-electrode method. The as-prepared Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5} pellet was cut into a thin rectangular bar, and gold wires were attached onto the sample's surface with silver paint. The heat capacity was measured by a thermal relaxation method using a square-shaped sample plate (9.0 mg). The temperature dependence of dc magnetic susceptibility was measured in the protocols of zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) under a field of 10 Oe. The dc magnetization was also measured as a function of magnetic field at 2 K.

Figure 1 shows the XRD profile of the Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5} sample. The reflections can be well indexed by a hexagonal unit cell whose size is slightly larger than that of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5}, and no obvious impurity phase can be identified. The Rietveld refinement was successful, and the resulting structural parameters are listed in Table 1. Compared with K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5}, the a axis is 3.0% larger, while the c axis is expanded by only 0.28%. Since the a axis just measures the interchain distance [see the inset of Fig. 1(b)], one may expect a weaker interchain interaction in Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5}. This is further revealed by the enlargement of the hretarchian Cr-Cr distance (from 7.30 A in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5} to 7.63 A in Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5}), while the average Cr-Cr bond distance remains almost unchanged. Also, the [(Cr_{3}As_{5})^{2-}]_{\infty} column itself suffers significant modifications. The Cr2-Cr2 bond distance of the Cr2 triangle in the z=0 plane _decreases_ by 4.5%, and the Cr1-Cr1 bond distance in the z=0.5 plane _expands_ by 1.5%, as compared with those in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5}. Consequently, the geometry of the Cr octahedron becomes inverse.

Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of resistivity \rho(T) for the Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} polycrystalline sample. The \rho(T) shows metallic conduction and, similar to that in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}, a T-linear resistivity can also be seen, albeit in a narrow temperature range from 5 to 35 K. This indicates a non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior, if it is not an accidental phenomenon due to a "polycrystal effect" [16]. The origin of the NFL behavior could be related to a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid state [17], which is characteristic of a 1D fermion system [3, 18]. Nonetheless, superconductivity emerges below 4.8 K with a transition width \Delta T_{\rm c}=0.44 K [\Delta T_{\rm c}=T(90\%\rho_{\rm n})-T(10\%\rho_{\rm n}), where \rho_{\rm n} refers to the extrapolated normal-state resistivity at the superconducting transition midpoint]. This \Delta T_{\rm c} value is obviously larger than that (0.24 K) of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5}, which seems to be related to the relatively weak interchain coupling in Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{5}. Other explanations of the broadening of superconducting transition include less inhomogeneity and/or larger stresses in the present polycrystalline sample.

Upon applying magnetic field, T_{\rm c} decreases monotonically, as shown in Fig. 2(b), from which the upper critical field H_{\rm c2} can be determined using the conventional criteria of 90%\rho_{\rm n}. The resulting H_{\rm c2} is plotted as a function of temperature in

  Fig. 2(c). The initial slope \mu_{0}(dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{\rm c}} is -5.08 T/K. If using the empirical Ginzburg-Landau relation [19], H_{c2}(T)=H_{c2}(0)(1-t^{2})/(1+t^{2}), where t denotes a reduced temperature T/T_{\rm c}, the upper critical field at zero temperature [\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)] is estimated to be \sim 20 T. Alternatively, the orbital limited upper critical field \mu_{0}H_{c0}^{\rm orb}(0) can be estimated by the Werthammer-Helfand-Hohenberg model [20, 21], which yields \mu_{0}H_{c0}^{\rm orb}(0)=-0.693T_{\rm c}(d\mu_{0}H_{c2}/dT)_{T_{\rm c}}\approx 17 T for an isotropic full superconducting gap in the dirty limit and without spin-orbit coupling. Both the \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) values exceed the Pauli paramagnetic limited upper critical field of \mu_{0}H_{\rm P}=1.84T_{\rm c}\approx 9.0 T (also for an isotropic full superconducting gap without spin-orbit coupling) [22, 23]. Note that the H_{c2}(T) data were measured on the polycrystalline sample, and one may expect a higher H_{c2}(0) for \bf H\bf|. A similar phenomenon of large H_{c2}(0) beyond the Pauli limit was reported in Q1D Li_{0.9}Mo_{6}O_{17}[10], which was regarded as evidence of spin-triplet SC [11]. For the Q1D superconductor Tl_{2}Mo_{6}Se_{6} (T_{\rm c}=4.2 K), in comparison, the measured \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) values are 5.8 and 0.47 T, respectively, for magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the c axis [14], both of which are less than the Pauli-limited upper critical field.

In order to verify whether the observed SC is of a bulk nature, we performed dc magnetic susceptibility measurements in both ZFC and FC modes under a 10 Oe magnetic field. Indeed, a superconducting diamagnetic transition can be seen at T_{\rm c}=4.8 K in Fig. 3(a). The volume fraction of magnetic shielding scaled by 4\pi\chi_{\rm ZFC} is 91% at 2 K after the correction of the demagnetization effect, suggesting bulk SC. In contrast, the volume fraction of magnetic repulsion (4\pi\chi_{\rm FC}) is merely 1.6%. This could be due to the magnetic flux pinning in the process of cooling down under magnetic fields. It is also noted that the diamagnetic transition width is significantly broadened, compared with K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}[12], consistent with the above resistivity measurement result. Figure 3(b) shows the field dependence of magnetization at 2 K, indicating an extreme type-II SC with a very small lower critical field (below 40 Oe). The magnetic flux pinning effect is evident from the magnetic hysteresis loop.

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of specific heat [C(T)] in the low-T regime, plotted in a C/T vs T^{2} scale. In a short temperature range from 4.8 to 6 K, the C/T vs T^{2} is essentially linear, and the linear fit with a formula C/T=\gamma_{\rm h}+\beta T^{2} yields an intersect of \gamma_{\rm h}=55.1 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} and a slope of \beta=2.9 mJ K^{-4} mol^{-1}. The \gamma_{\rm h} value refers to the normal-state Sommerfeld coefficient, which is lower but comparable to that of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} (70-75 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1}) [12]. With the fitted \beta value, and using the formula \delta_{\rm D}=[(12/5)N\,R\pi^{4}/g]^{1/3}, the Debye temperature can be calculated to be 175 K, which is reasonably smaller than that in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} (215-218 K).

Bulk SC is further confirmed by the characteristic specific-heat jump [\Delta(C)] below 4.8 K. In general, the phonon contribution to the specific heat in the superconducting state

\begin{tabular}{l c c}  & K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} [Å = K [12] and Rb (present work)]. The atomic coordinates are as follows: As1 (x, -x,0); As2 (x, -x,0.5); Cr1 (x, -x,0.5); Cr2 (x, -x,0); A1 (x, -x,0.5); A2 (1/3,2/3,0). T_{\rm c}, \Delta T_{\rm c}, H_{c2}, \gamma_{\rm h}, \delta_{\rm D}, and \Delta C denote the superconducting critical temperature, transition width, upper critical field, electronic specific-heat coefficient, Debye temperature, and dimensionless specific-heat jump, respectively.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c}  & T_{\rm c} & T_{\rm c} & T_{\rm c} \\  & &  follows the relation fitted from the normal-state C(T) data. Hence the electronic specific heat [C_{\rm e}(T)] can be obtained by the deduction of \beta T^{3} from the total C(T)[24]. The inset of Fig. 4(a) shows the obtained C_{\rm e}(T) (normalized by \gamma_{\rm u}T) as a function of temperature. By the entropy conserving construction, the thermodynamic transition temperature is determined to be 4.4 K. The dimensionless specific-heat jump at T_{\rm c} [\Delta C/(\gamma_{\rm u}T_{\rm c})] is about 1.8, substantially lower than that (2.0-2.4) in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}, which seems to be related to the reduced interchain coupling. Here we are unable to make a reasonable fit for the C_{\rm e}(T) dependence because of the limitation of the temperature range (only down to 0.43T_{\rm c}).

To examine whether the superconducting gap has nodes, we investigated the magnetic field dependence of the electronic specific heat C_{\rm e}(T,H) which gives the information about the low-energy excitations in the superconducting state. For a conventional fully gapped type-II superconductor, the excited states are basically the "normal-state quasiparticles" in the vortex cores. This generates an additional Sommerfeld coefficient of \gamma(H)\approx\frac{\hbar}{H_{c}(T)}\gamma_{\rm u} at zero temperature in the superconducting mixed state [25]. At zero field, the linear extrapolation of C/T vs T^{2} gives a "residual" Sommerfeld coefficient of \gamma_{\rm u}=5.3 mJ K^{-2}mol^{-1}, which could be either due to the existence of a small fraction (\sim 10%) of the nonsuperconducting phase, or because of the existence of quasiparticles from impurity scattering in the case of nodal superconductivity. With increasing magnetic fields, \gamma(H) increases faster than the full-gap prediction, especially at lower fields. Further, [\gamma(H)-\gamma_{\rm 0}] basically obeys the Volovik relation (i.e., \propto\sqrt{H}) [26], suggesting the presence of nodes in the superconducting gap.

It is informative to compare the two the Cr_{3}As_{3}-chain based superconductors, K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} and Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}, whose structural and physical parameters are listed in Table 1. The "anisotropic" expansion of the a axis suggests a weaker interchain coupling in Rb_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}, which could account for the broadening of the superconducting transition and a reduced \Delta C/(\gamma_{\rm u}T_{\rm c}) value. Nevertheless, superconductivity emerges at a comparable temperature, and the variation of T_{\rm c} (decreased by 21%) basically scales with the change in \gamma_{\rm u} (decreased by 22%) which measures the DOS at E_{\rm F}. If this is not an incidental phenomenon, one may expect higher T_{\rm c} for a larger \gamma_{\rm u} value. The estimated upper critical field exceeding the Pauli limit by a factor of 2 can be a hint for spin-triplet Cooper pairing. In addition, the existence of nodes in the superconducting order parameter, as suggested by the thermodynamic analysis, does not contradict with the spin-triplet scenario. Although much work needs to be done for the details of the superconducting order parameter, the fact that the only two existing members
