###### Abstract

The Nernst effect was measured in the electron-doped cuprate superconductor Pr2-x Ce2CuO4 (PCCO) at four concentrations, from underdoped (x=0.13) to overdoped (x=0.17), for a wide range of temperatures above the critical temperature T_{c}. A magnetic field H up to 15 T was used to reliably access the normal-state quasiparticle contribution to the Nernst signal N_{\rm qp}, which is subtracted from the total signal N, to obtain the superconducting contribution N_{\rm sc}. As a function of H, N_{\rm sc} peaks at a field H^{\star} whose temperature dependence obeys H_{c2}^{\star}\ln(T/T_{c}), as it does in a conventional superconductor such as Nb2Si2... The doping dependence of the characteristic field scale H_{c2}^{\star}, shown to be closely related to the upper critical field H_{c2}, tracks the domelike dependence of T_{c}, showing that superconductivity is weakened below the quantum critical point where the Fermi surface is reconstructed, presumably by the onset of antiferromagnetic order. Our data at all dopings are quantitatively consistent with the theory of Gaussian superconducting fluctuations, eliminating the need to invoke unusual vortexlike excitations above T_{c}, and ruling out phase fluctuations as the mechanism for the fall of T_{c} with underdoping. We compare the properties of PCCO with those of hole-doped cuprates and conclude that the domes of T_{c} and H_{c2} versus doping in the latter materials are also controlled predominantly by phase competition rather than phase fluctuations.

## I Introduction

Cuprate superconductors have attracted enormous attention because they hold the record for the highest critical temperature T_{c}, which can be as high as 164 K, halfway to room temperature [1]. As a function of doping, T_{c} displays a dome-like dependence, reaching a maximal value at some optimal doping. A fundamental question is as follows: Why does T_{c} not continue to rise with underdoping? A long-held scenario is that the pairing strength (and superconducting gap magnitude) does continue to rise, but the critical temperature T_{c} for long-range coherence falls because of increasingly strong fluctuations in the phase of the superconducting order parameter [2]. So, the underlying strength of superconductivity would become greater than suggested by the maximal (optimal) value of T_{c}, and finding ways to increase phase rigidity could further increase the maximal T_{c}.

The main experimental support for this phase fluctuation scenario came from the observation of a sizable Nernst signal above T_{c} in underdoped cuprates such as La2-x Sr2CuO4 (LSCO) [3, 4]. The Nernst effect, the transverse thermoelectric response to a magnetic field, is large in the vortex-liquid state of type-II superconductors, due to the motion of vortices [5]. Consequently, the observation of a large Nernst signal well above T_{c} in hole-doped cuprates was attributed to short-lived vortex excitations above T_{c}[3]. In this picture, Cooper pairs with a finite gap in their excitation spectrum survive to temperatures as high as T\simeq 3T_{c}. Defining the upper critical field H_{c2} needed to suppress superconductivity as the field where the Nernst signal vanishes, H_{c2} was found to increase with underdoping, and this was taken as evidence of a rising gap [6]. A paradigm was born: While the superconducting gap and the upper critical field increase with underdoping, T_{c} decreases due to phase fluctuations.

In recent years, it was shown that the three basic assumptions underlying this interpretation of the Nernst response in cuprates are invalid. The first assumption was that the quasiparticle contribution to the measured Nernst signal N_{\rm qp} is negligible, so that all of the signal can be attributed to superconducting fluctuations. It has since become clear that N_{\rm qp} can in fact be large in a variety of strongly correlated metals [7], including cuprates [8]. For example, Nernst measurements in YBa2Cu3O4 (YBCO) and HgBa2CuO4+3 (Hg1201) reveal a large negative N_{\rm qp}, easily disentangled from N_{\rm sc} because its sign is opposite to that of the superconducting signal [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. In these materials, N_{\rm qp} starts to grow below the pseudogap temperature T^{\star}, and it becomes comparable in magnitude to N_{\rm sc} at T_{c}. In the electron-doped material PCCO, the two contributions are again readily resolved, even though both are positive in this case, because N_{\rm qp} exhibits a peak at high temperature while N_{\rm sc} peaks at T_{c}, which is relatively low in this material [14, 15]. A similar two-peak structure is observed in the hole-doped material La2-x-y Eu3Sr2CuO4 (Eu-LSCO) [8]. In LSCO, the material on which the early studies were based, N_{\rm qp}(T) is very similar to that of Eu-LSCO, but, because T_{c} is higher in LSCO, its peak now merges with the peak in N_{\rm sc}(T), and hence the two contributions are more difficult to disentangle [8].

The second assumption is that N_{\rm sc}(H) vanishes above H_{c2}. Nernst measurements on the conventional superconductor Nb2Si2... have revealed that a superconducting signal can persist to fields as high as H\simeq 4H_{c2} (and to temperatures as high as T\simeq 30T_{c}) [16, 17]. This countered the notion that superconducting fluctuations do not exist above H_{c2}. The third assumption was that fluctuations which persist up to 2-3 T_{c} cannot be the usual Gaussian fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter, and hence these were attributed to unusual vortexlike excitations. In 2009, two groups arrived at a complete theory of Gaussian fluctuations in a dirty two-dimensional (2D) superconductor, extending earlier work [18] to arbitrary temperatures and fields [19, 20]. This theory was able to explain in detail and quantitatively the Nb_{x}Si_{1-x} data, proving that standard fluctuations can indeed persist up to T\gg T_{c} and H\gg H_{c2}.

The failure of these three assumptions and the advent of the new theoretical framework imposed a complete re-examination of the Nernst effect in cuprate superconductors. This started with a study of the hole-doped cuprate Eu-LSCO, in which N_{\rm sc}(T,H) was shown to behave in the same way as it does in Nb_{x}Si_{1-x} and to agree with Gaussian theory [21]. The characteristic field H_{\rm c2}^{\star} extracted directly from the data, which we show here to be approximately equal to H_{c2}, was found to be very low in the underdoped regime. The authors also reanalyzed the published Nernst data on other hole-doped cuprates to show that H_{\rm c2}^{\star} in fact decreases with underdoping [21], in contrast to the prior report of an increasing H_{c2}[6]. However, because the Eu-LSCO study was limited to dopings on the underdoped side of the T_{c} dome, it did not allow for the ultimate test: to compare the nature of superconducting fluctuations on the two sides of the dome, and see whether there is a fundamental difference, or not.

In this paper, we report a study of superconducting fluctuations in the electron-doped cuprate PCCO that extends across the phase diagram, allowing us to compare both sides of the dome. This cuprate offers a major advantage in that its critical magnetic field at all dopings is low enough that fluctuations can be fully suppressed by applying only 15 T, thereby allowing a careful extraction of the underlying quasiparticle contribution N_{\rm qp}. This is essential for a detailed analysis of N_{\rm sc}. We find that N_{\rm sc} obeys Gaussian fluctuation theory quantitatively, compelling evidence that fluctuations in this cuprate are not unusual, on either side of the dome.

We extract H_{\rm c2}^{\star} directly from the N_{\rm sc} data and find that it tracks T_{c} as a function of doping, with H_{\rm c2}^{\star} and T_{c} both showing a dome that peaks at the same critical doping. This doping is where the Fermi surface of PCCO is known to undergo a reconstruction [22], due to the onset of a competing phase that breaks translational symmetry, presumably antiferromagnetic order [23]. We conclude that superconductivity in electron-doped cuprates weakens below optimal doping not because of superconducting phase fluctuations, but because of phase competition. Comparing with the properties of hole-doped cuprates, we argue that the same conclusion applies for hole-doped materials.

## II Previous Work

The Nernst effect in PCCO has been measured previously, on thin films with 0.13\leq x\leq 0.19[14, 15, 24]. A sizable N_{\rm sc} was detected above T_{c} in underdoped samples, but _not_ in overdoped samples. As a result, Gaussian theory was tentatively ruled out and the signal was attributed to phase fluctuations which go away with overdoping. In our study, an improved signal-to-noise ratio and a higher magnetic field allow us to clearly detect N_{\rm sc} in the overdoped regime. We find that there is in fact no qualitative difference between overdoped and underdoped behavior. For x\leq 0.15, our data are consistent with previous data.

## III Methods

We measured four Pr_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-x} thin films to cover underdoped (x=0.13,0.14), optimally doped (x=0.15), and overdoped (x=0.17) compositions. The epitaxial thin films with [001] orientation were grown by pulsed laser deposition on LSAT [(LaAlO_{3})_{0.3}(Sr_{2}AlTaO_{6})_{0.7}] substrates using Cu-rich targets to eliminate parasitic phases [25]. Typical sample dimensions are 3\times 2 mm, with a thickness of 3000 A. The Nernst effect was measured using one heater, one differential thermocouple, and one absolute thermocouple [26]. We used nonmagnetic type-E thermocouples made of chromel and constantan wires. Resistivity measurements were performed in a Quantum Design PPMS. The electrical and thermal currents were applied along the basal plane of the tetragonal crystal structure, and the magnetic field was always applied perpendicular to the basal plane, i.e., along the c axis. The critical temperature T_{c} is defined as the temperature where the resistivity goes to zero; the values are listed in Table 1.

## IV Results

### Resistivity, T_{c}, and T_{\rm min}

Figure 1 displays the resistivity data \rho versus T for our four samples at H=0 to show the superconducting transition and at H=15 T to show the normal-state behavior. The T_{c} values are plotted in Fig. 2. As in all cuprate superconductors, T_{c} has a characteristic domelike dependence on doping. Except at x=0.17, all normal-state resistivity curves \rho(T) show a minimum, at a temperature T_{\rm min} which increases with decreasing x. Figure 2 shows the doping evolution of T_{\rm min}, seen to extrapolate to zero at x=0.16. This is also the critical doping where the normal-state Fermi surface of PCCO at T\to 0 is known to undergo a reconstruction, detected as a sudden change in the Hall coefficient R_{H}, going from small and positive at x>0.16 to large and negative at x\leq 0.16[22, 27]. This Fermi-surface reconstruction (FSR) is attributed to a quantum critical point (QCP) below which some ordered phase sets in, at x_{c}=0.16 (in the absence of superconductivity). Measurements of the Hall coefficient R_{H} at H=15 T in our own thin films find that in the low temperature limit, R_{H}>0 in our sample with x=0.17 and R_{H}<0 in our sample with x=0.15, confirming that the normal-state QCP at which FSR occurs in our samples is x_{c}=0.16\pm 0.01, in excellent agreement with prior data

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} x & T_{c} & H_{\rm tr}(0) & H_{\rm c2}^{\star} \\  & (K) & (T) & (T) \\ \hline
0.13 & 8.8 \pm 0.3 & 3.4 \pm 0.3 & 2.1 \pm 0.2 \\
0.14 & 17.4 \pm 0.1 & 10.1 \pm 0.5 & 4.3 \pm 0.3 \\
0.15 & 19.5 \pm 0.1 & 8.

  [22, 27]. The FSR is also responsible for the upturn in \rho(T) at low T. The resistivity at x=0.17 is strictly linear in T below 40 K, in agreement with previous reports [28, 29]. The absence of any upturn shows that x=0.17 is above the critical doping x_{c}; the linearity shows that it is close to the QCP. Our resistivity data as presented in Figs. 1 and 2 provide a guide to the reconstruction of the Fermi surface in PCCO and form the basis of our discussion in Sec. V.1, where we elaborate on the QCP and the FSR, phenomena that are fundamental for understanding the superconducting phase diagram.

### Vortex-solid melting field H_{\rm vs}

Having displayed the doping dependence of the critical temperature T_{c}, we now turn our attention to a second fundamental quantity, the critical magnetic field needed to suppress superconductivity. We call H_{\rm vs}(T) the critical field above which the electrical resistance of the sample ceases to be zero. In a type-II superconductor such as PCCO, this is the field at which the vortex solid melts, hence the labeling. We measured the resistivity of our PCCO films at different temperatures below T_{c} to track the temperature dependence of H_{\rm vs} at each doping. The resulting field-temperature phase diagram is shown in Fig. 3. At all dopings, H_{\rm vs} has the typical behavior of cuprate superconductors, with positive curvature.

Above the H_{\rm vs}(T) line, the electronic state is a vortex liquid. The question of where this vortex liquid ends in cuprates has been the subject of much debate [30]. Recently, it was shown that measurements of the thermal conductivity can be used to answer that question [31]. In three hole-doped cuprates, it was found that there is no vortex-liquid phase at T\to 0[31]. In other words, with decreasing field, at T=0, vortices appear precisely at H_{\rm vs}(0). This provides a convenient empirical procedure for determining the upper critical field H_{c2}, namely, H_{c2}=H_{\rm vs}(0). Of course, with increasing temperature, the vortex-liquid phase grows.

To extrapolate to T=0, we use the standard expression for the temperature dependence of H_{\rm vs}(T)[32, 33, 34]:

\[\frac{\sqrt{b_{m}(T)}}{1-b_{m}(T)}\frac{t}{\sqrt{1-t}}\biggl{[}\frac{4(\sqrt{2 }-1)}{\sqrt{1-b_{m}(T)}}+1\biggr{]}=\frac{2\pi c_{L}^{2}}{\sqrt{G_{i}}},\] (1)

Figure 3: (Color online) Vortex-solid melting lines as a function of temperature, plotted as H_{\rm vs}(T) vs T/T_{c}, for dopings as indicated. H_{\rm vs}(T) is the field below which the sample resistance is zero (full circles). Solid lines are fits to Eq. (1), used to extrapolate H_{\rm vs}(T) to T=0 and obtain H_{\rm vs}(0), whose value is listed in Table 1. The open circle in the top right panel marks the value of the upper critical field H_{c2} obtained from thermal conductivity data at x=0.15 (see Fig. 4).

Figure 2: (Color online) Temperature-doping phase diagram of PCCO, showing the superconducting dome delineated by the zero-field critical temperature T_{c} (black circles). Also shown is T_{\rm min} (red squares), the temperature at which the resistivity \rho(T) has a minimum (see Fig. 1). The red line is a linear fit to the T_{\rm min} data, extrapolated to T=0 (open square). The corresponding doping x_{c}=0.16 is the quantum critical point below which the Fermi-surface reconstruction (FSR) onsets, in agreement with the critical doping where the normal-state Hall coefficient R_{H} at T\to 0 exhibits a sharp drop to negative values [22]. Throughout our discussion in Sec. V, we will use this figure as a map of FSR in PCCO that is derived from resistivity.

  in terms of the reduced field b_{m}=H_{\rm vs}/H_{\rm vs}(0) and reduced temperature t=T/T_{c}. We use the same definitions for the Ginzburg and Lindemann parameters (G_{i} and c_{L}) as in Ref. [34]. In Fig. 3, we see that Eq. (1) fits the data well and allows us to obtain H_{\rm vs}(0), whose value at each doping is listed in Table 1. The same expression was also found to fit the H_{\rm vs} data of hole-doped cuprates very well, in both underdoped and overdoped regimes [31, 34].

We can use existing thermal conductivity data to confirm that H_{c2} is indeed equal to H_{\rm vs}(T\to 0) in PCCO. In Fig. 4, we reproduce published data taken at T=0.2 K on a single crystal of PCCO at optimal doping (x=0.15, T_{c}=20 K) [35]. We see from those data that H_{c2}=8\pm 1 T, in excellent agreement with the value of H_{\rm vs}(0)=8.9\pm 0.4 T we obtain by extrapolating H_{\rm vs}(T) to T=0 (Fig. 3). A similar value for H_{\rm vs}(0) is reported in prior studies [36].

### Nernst effect: Overdoped sample (x=0.17)

In presenting our Nernst data on PCCO, we begin with the overdoped sample at x=0.17. There are two reasons for this initial focus. First, this sample provides a fundamental reference point for all Nernst studies of cuprate superconductors, missing until now. In an overdoped sample, the Fermi surface is neither reconstructed nor altered by a pseudogap: it is simply a single large holelike cylinder, whose area is precisely given by the doping. In hole-doped cuprates, this k-space area is proportional to 1+p[37]; in PCCO, it is proportional to 1-x[23]. Moreover, in PCCO, we have a particularly simple crystal structure, which is tetragonal and free of bilayers, buckling, oxygen order, or chains [38]. The Nernst data we report here can therefore be regarded as the archetype of an overdoped cuprate, the property of a single pristine CuO_{2} plane. Second, having data in the overdoped regime will enable us to make the first direct comparison of superconducting fluctuations on the left and right sides of the T_{c} dome, and establish the differences, if any.

In Fig. 5, we show the in-plane resistivity \rho(T) of our x=0.17 sample, below 30 K. With increasing temperature, \rho rises suddenly at T_{c}=13.4 K. Above T_{c}, there is a regime of paraconductivity, where superconducting fluctuations reduce the resistivity from its normal-state value. The data at H=15 T provide the normal-state reference, _modulo_ a small rigid shift in \rho(T) due to a positive orbital magnetoresistance. Note that paraconductivity can be seen up to 2 T_{c} or so (see inset of Fig. 5).

The raw Nernst signal N as a function of field is shown in Fig. 6(a), at T=1.08T_{c}. N(H) shows an initial rise with a subsequent fall on top of a smoothly increasing background. The peak at low field is due to superconducting fluctuations N_{\rm sc}, while the background is the normal-state quasiparticle signal N_{\rm qp}. The total Nernst signal is the sum of these two components:

\[N=N_{\rm sc}+N_{\rm qp}.\] (2)

To establish the background for each isotherm, we fit the data above 10 T to a power law:

\[N_{\rm qp}=a(T)H+b(T)H^{3}.\] (3)

The dotted line in Fig. 6(a) is a fit to Eq. (3). We see that it describes the raw data very well from \sim6 T all the way to 15 T. Note that a cubic term is essential to capture the correct H dependence of N_{\rm qp}. In previous work, limited to lower fields [15], N_{\rm qp} was assumed to have a purely linear dependence, but in principle all odd powers of H are allowed by symmetry.

In Fig. 6(b), we plot the superconducting signal N_{\rm sc}=N-N_{\rm qp}. It rises rapidly from zero, goes through a peak, and then decreases gradually, to eventually become vanishingly small at high field, for H>2H_{c2} or so. [It has been suggested that there may be an intrinsic limit to how high superconducting fluctuations can extend above H_{c2} (or T_{c}), associated with the uncertainty principle [39, 40].] This is a

Figure 4: (Color online) Thermal conductivity \kappa as a function of magnetic field H, measured at T=0.2 K on a single crystal of PCCO with x=0.15 (T_{c}=20 K) (data from Ref. [35]). The saturation of \kappa vs H marks the end of the vortex state, providing a direct measurement of the upper critical field H_{c2}, defined as the field above which vortices disappear [31], giving H_{c2}=8\pm 1 T.

Figure 5: (Color online) Resistivity of our PCCO sample with x=0.17. The critical temperature is defined as the temperature where the zero-field data (red) go to zero: T_{c}=13.4 K. The normal-state behavior is given by the data in a field H=15 T (blue), which includes a slight rigid upward shift due to positive magnetoresistance. A regime of paraconductivity is detectable below T\simeq 2T_{c}, due to superconducting fluctuations that gradually decrease \rho(T), before its rapid drop to zero at T_{c}. Inset: zoom on paraconductivity: \Delta\rho\equiv\rho(0)-\rho(15\Gamma) vs T.

  typical signal for a superconductor. In fact, N_{\rm sc} displays these same features in all superconductors, at T>T_{c}. In particular, there is always a peak field, which we label H^{\star}. We see that H^{\star} is a characteristic field scale for superconductivity in a given material that is directly and immediately obtainable from the data, with no assumptions and no model or theory.

As a function of temperature, N_{\rm sc} decreases in magnitude, but the peak field H^{\star} increases. In Fig. 7, we show on a field-temperature phase diagram the temperature dependence of H^{\star} above T_{c}, and also H_{\rm vs}(T) measured on the same sample, below T_{c}. In addition, we sketch the temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_{c2}(T). H^{\star}(T) and H_{c2}(T) are images of each other on either side of T_{c}, and for this reason H^{\star} has been called the "ghost critical field" [41]. The H^{\star} data can be fit to a logarithmic dependence, such that

\[H^{\star}=H^{\star}_{c2}\ln(T/T_{c}).\] (4)

The prefactor H^{\star}_{c2} is a single empirical parameter that characterizes the strength of superconductivity.

The \ln(T/T_{c}) dependence in Eq. (4) was explained intuitively by Pourret _et al._ in the context of {\rm Nb_{x}Si_{1-x}} thin films [17]. They proposed that the crossover from increasing to decreasing N_{\rm sc} occurs because the length scale for superconducting fluctuations at low H is set by the coherence length \xi(T), while at high H it is set by the magnetic length \ell_{B}\!=\!\sqrt{\hbar/eH}. H^{\star} would be the field where the two length scales become comparable, i.e., \xi(H^{\star})\!\simeq\!\ell_{B}(H^{\star}). Since \xi(T)\propto 1/\sqrt{\ln(T/T_{c})} and \ell_{B}(H^{\star})\propto 1/\sqrt{H^{\star}}, this yields H^{\star}\propto\ln(T/T_{c}).

The one-parameter fit to the x\!=\!0.17 data in Fig. 7 using Eq. (4) yields H^{\star}_{c2}\!=\!3.0\pm 0.3 T (Table 1). (Note that the data deviate from the fit close to T_{c}, an intrinsic effect explained in Sec. V.3) This value can be compared with our estimate of H_{c2} for that same sample, obtained as the T\!=\!0 limit of the resistive critical field H_{\rm vs}(T), whose value is H_{\rm vs}(0)=3.0\pm 0.2 T (see Table 1 and Figs. 3 and 7). We arrive at a useful empirical result: The characteristic field scale encoded in superconducting fluctuations above T_{c}, when defined as in Eq. (4), is equal to the field needed to kill superconductivity at T\!=\!0. In other words, we now have a straightforward empirical procedure for measuring the fundamental field scale for superconductivity H_{c2}, from superconducting fluctuations above T_{c}. Note that this is for a single-band d-wave superconductor.

In summary, superconducting fluctuations in overdoped PCCO, at x\!=\!0.17, are detectable in N_{\rm sc} up to T\!\simeq\!2T_{c} and H\!\simeq\!2H_{c2}, and they can be used to measure H_{c2}. What is the nature of these fluctuations? As we show in Sec. V, not only does N_{\rm sc} have precisely the field dependence predicted by Gaussian theory, its magnitude is in excellent agreement with theoretical expectations. We conclude that the

The black dotted line is a polynomial fit to the data above 10 T, of the form N_{\rm qp}=a(T)H+b(T)H^{\star}. N_{\rm qp} is the quasiparticle background of the underlying normal state. (b) Superconducting contribution to the Nernst signal, defined as N_{\rm sc}=N-N_{\rm qp} [Eq. (2)]. For any given temperature above T_{c}, N_{\rm sc} vs H exhibits a peak, at a field labeled H^{\star} (arrow).

The solid red line is a fit of the H^{\star} vs T data, to the formula H^{\star}=H^{\star}_{c2}\ln(T/T_{c}) [Eq. (4)]. The vortex-solid melting field H_{\rm vs}(T) (open circles) is the boundary between the vortex-solid phase (VS), where the electrical resistance is zero, and the vortex-liquid phase (VL), where the resistance is nonzero. The upper critical field H_{c2} (green dotted line) is the boundary between the vortex liquid and the normal state, where there are no vortices. At T=0, there is no vortex liquid since H_{c2}(0)=H_{\rm vs}(0), as reported for hole-doped cuprates [31], and shown here for PCCO at x=0.15 (Figs. 3 and 4). The green dotted line is a schematic representation. Note that the two characteristic field scales for superconductivity, obtained, respectively, at T\to 0 and at T>T_{c}, are equal for x=0.17, namely, H_{c2}(0)=H^{\star}_{c2}=3.0 T (Table 1).

  superconducting fluctuations of an overdoped cuprate are now well understood.

### Nernst effect: All dopings (0.13\leqslant x\leqslant 0.17)

The left panels of Fig. 8 present a selection of raw Nernst isotherms, labeled by their reduced temperature \epsilon\equiv(T-T_{\rm c})/T_{\rm c}, for each of the four samples. The superconducting Nernst signal N_{\rm sc} is shown in the corresponding right panels. Examples of background subtraction are given in Fig. 9, for x=0.13 and 0.14. As in the x=0.17 sample, there is a large positive N_{\rm qp}, mostly linear in H, but with a small additional H^{3} term. The peak field H^{\star} obtained from N_{\rm sc} versus H is plotted versus \epsilon in Fig. 10 for the four dopings. A fit to Eq. (4) yields the H^{\star}_{22} values listed in Table 1, and plotted versus x in Fig. 11. For all x, the data deviate from the fit as T\to T_{\rm c}, for reasons given in Sec. V.3. In Fig. 12(a), we plot the Nernst coefficient v, defined as v\equiv N/H, versus H. We see that it is flat at low H, i.e., N is linear as H\to 0. In Fig. 12(b), we plot the initial value of v(H), which we call v_{0}, versus \epsilon. In Table 2, we list the values of v_{0} for the four dopings, at \epsilon=0.1, and compare these to theoretical expectations in Sec. V.3.

Figure 8: (Color online) Left panels: Raw Nernst data as a function of field for our four samples, at dopings as indicated. For each doping, we present seven isotherms, at \epsilon=0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.4, where \epsilon=(T-T_{\rm c})/T_{\rm c}, with T_{\rm c} as indicated. Right panels: Superconducting contribution to the Nernst signal N_{\rm sc}, obtained by subtracting the normal-state background N_{\rm qp}, as shown in Figs. 6 and 9, according to Eqs. (2) and (3). Note that with increasing temperature, the magnitude of N_{\rm sc} decreases and the peak field H^{\star} moves up. H^{\star} is plotted vs \epsilon in Fig. 10.

Figure 10: (Color online) Temperature dependence of the peak field H^{\star} in PCCO, at dopings as indicated, plotted as a function of \epsilon\equiv(T-T_{\rm c})/T_{\rm c}. H^{\star} is the field at which N_{\rm sc} peaks, in isotherms of N_{\rm sc} vs H as shown in the right panels of Fig. 8. The lines are a fit of the data to the function H^{\star}=H^{\star}_{2}\ln(T/T_{\rm c}) [Eq. (4)]. The fit allows us to extract a single characteristic field H^{\star}_{22} from the superconducting fluctuations at each doping, directly from the data. The values of the single fit parameter H^{\star}_{22} are listed in Table 1 and plotted vs x in Fig. 11. At low \epsilon, the data deviate from the fit for reasons given in Sec. V.3.

In the normal state at T\to 0, achieved by applying a field H>H_{c2}, R_{H} undergoes a sudden and dramatic change below x_{c}= 0.16. It goes from small and positive to large and negative [22]. ARPES measurements on NCCO reveal a transformation as sketched in Fig. 13, whereby the large holelike cylinder of the overdoped regime is reconstructed into two small pockets, respectively located at (\pi,0) and (\pi/2,\pi/2), as the doping is reduced below x\simeq 0.16[43]. This reconstruction is consistent with the observation of low-frequency quantum oscillations in NCCO [44], which reveal the existence of a small closed pocket in the Fermi surface, tentatively attributed to the pocket seen by ARPES near (\pi/2,\pi/2).

The evidence so far is consistent with a Fermi-surface reconstruction caused by the onset of a density-wave order with a wave vector Q = (\pi,\pi) [23], which could well be the commensurate Neel antiferromagnetic order observed by neutrons at low x[45]. In this case, the pocket at (\pi,0) is electronlike and the pocket at (\pi/2,\pi/2) is holelike. One generically expects a Lifshitz transition to occur at a doping well below x_{c}, where the holelike pocket disappears, leaving only the electronlike pocket at (\pi,0) (see Fig. 13) [23].

The FSR described here will affect all transport properties. In addition to the dramatic changes in R_{H}, the resistivity \rho also shows signatures of FSR, in particular the upturn in \rho(T) seen at low temperature (Fig. 1), which we attribute to the loss of carrier density. The temperature T_{\rm min} of the minimum in \rho(T) may then be viewed roughly as the onset of FSR as a function of temperature (Fig. 2). In the resistivity, the onset of FSR at T=0 also occurs at x_{c}=0.16, where T_{\rm min}\to 0, in agreement with the R_{H}(0) data, but at T=20 K it only occurs at x=0.15 (see Fig. 2). In other words, the Fermi surface of PCCO at x=0.15 may be considered unreconstructed for T>T_{c}.

For our study of superconductivity, what we immediately note is that T_{c} falls with underdoping as soon as it crosses the T_{\rm min} line (Fig. 2). This strongly suggests that the cause of the T_{c} dome is the FSR or, more fundamentally, whatever causes the FSR. In the following sections, we bring support to this scenario of phase competition in two different ways: first, by showing that the characteristic field H_{c2}^{\star} also falls below x=0.15, forming a dome just like the T_{c} dome; second, by showing that the superconducting fluctuations on both sides of the dome are not qualitatively different. These observations remove the need to invoke the emergence of phase fluctuations on the underdoped side.

### Characteristic field H_{c2}^{\star} and critical field H_{c2}

In Fig. 11, we plot H_{c2}^{\star} as a function of x. This is the field scale encoded in the superconducting fluctuations just above T_{c}. We see that H_{c2}^{\star} tracks T_{c}, both showing a dome peaking at the same doping, namely, x=0.15. As already mentioned, this is the doping where FSR onsets for T\simeq 20 K (see Fig. 2). This shows that what causes T_{c} to fall below x=0.15 also causes H_{c2}^{\star} to fall, i.e., the coherence length \xi to increase. Note that \xi is an average of v_{F}/\Delta over the Fermi surface, where v_{F} is the Fermi velocity and \Delta is the gap magnitude, so that changes in either v_{F} or \Delta (or both) will affect \xi, and hence H_{c2}^{\star}.

Let us examine the evolution of H_{c2}^{\star} more closely. At T=20 K, the Fermi surface is not reconstructed in going from x=0.17 to 0.15, so the Fermi-surface average of v_{F} should be mostly unchanged. Therefore, the increase in H_{c2}^{\star} from 3.0 to 5.4 T must be due to an increase in \Delta. We can check that by looking at the ratio H_{c2}^{\star}/T_{c}^{2}, which should remain constant if only \Delta changes since (in a simple model) H_{c2}^{\star}\sim\Delta^{2} and T_{c}\sim\Delta. At x=0.17 and 0.15, H_{c2}^{\star}/T_{c}^{2}=17\pm 2 mT/K^{2} and 14\pm 1 mT/K^{2}, respectively. We see that within error bars, the rise in both H_{c2}^{\star} and T_{c} is driven entirely by an increase in \Delta. Moreover, the magnitude of H_{c2}^{\star} is consistent with expectation for a dirty d-wave superconductor. Indeed, using H_{c2}^{\star}\simeq\Phi_{0}/2\pi\,\xi_{0}^{2} and expressions for \xi_{0} given in Appendix A, we estimate that H_{c2}^{\star}=2.3 and 5.1 T for x=0.17 and 0.15, compared to measured values of 3.0 \pm 0.3 T and 5.4 \pm 0.3 T, respectively. In summary, we understand the magnitude and doping dependence of H_{c2}^{\star} in PCCO when its Fermi surface is _not_ reconstructed.

Let us now see what happens when the Fermi surface _is_ reconstructed. The Fermi surface changes from a single large pocket with a large v_{F} to two small pockets with a much smaller v_{F}[44]. This will boost H_{c2}^{\star} and H_{\rm vs}(0), so the fact that H_{c2}^{\star} nevertheless falls below x=0.15 implies that \Delta must necessarily decrease. In Fig. 14, a plot of the ratio H_{\rm vs}(0)/T_{c}^{2} versus x reveals that the enhancement of H_{\rm vs}(0) due to the smaller v_{F} gets gradually stronger with underdoping.

Note that when the Fermi surface changes we expect the ratio H_{\rm vs}(0)/H_{c2}^{\star} to change because H_{\rm vs}(0) is controlled by those k-space regions with the smallest \xi, while N_{\rm sc}, and hence H_{c2}^{\star}, is dominated by those regions with the largest \xi [see Eq. (6) in Sec. V.3 and the discussion that follows], and the relative proportion of these regions will change. In Fig. 11, we see that while H_{\rm vs}(0)=H_{c2}^{\star} at x=0.17, the FSR causes H_{\rm vs}(0) to become larger than H_{c2}^{\star} and drop at slightly lower doping compared to H_{c2}^{\star} due to the details of FSR. Nevertheless, the main point is that the low value of H_{c2} at x=0.13 is clear

  evidence that the gap is smaller at that doping (x=0.13), than it is at x=0.15.

The emerging picture is the following. With decreasing x, starting at x\simeq 0.2, the d-wave gap \Delta_{0} grows, causing T_{\rm c} and H_{\rm c2} to grow, until a critical doping where FSR sets in, whereupon superconductivity is weakened, and both T_{\rm c} and H_{\rm c2} fall. The FSR is due to the onset of a density-wave state that breaks translational symmetry, and fundamentally it is this second phase that competes with superconductivity [46, 47]. This type of phase competition scenario is observed in several families of unconventional superconductors, including the quasi-1D organic metals [48, 49], the quasi-2D iron-based superconductors [50], and the quasi-3D heavy-fermion metals [51, 52], where in all cases the competing phase is a spin-density wave. The organizing principle in such a scenario is the QCP where the second phase sets in, invariably located inside the T_{c} dome. We conclude that the fundamental mechanism for a dome of T_{c} versus doping in PCCO is again phase competition, most likely also with a phase of antiferromagnetic order [38].

### Comparison to theory of Gaussian fluctuations

Until now, we have extracted information from N_{\rm sc} without having recourse to any theory or model or assumption. We simply obtained H^{\star} directly from the data of N_{\rm sc} versus H, and then obtained H^{\star}_{\rm c2} directly from the T dependence of H^{\star}. In this section, we compare our data in PCCO to the standard (Aslamazov-Larkin) theory of superconducting fluctuations [53].

The calculated quantity is the superconducting contribution to the transverse thermoelectric conductivity \alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy}, while the measured quantity is N_{\rm sc}. The two are related as

\[\alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy}\simeq\frac{N_{\rm sc}}{\rho},\] (5)

assuming |\,S\tan\theta_{H}\,|\ll\,N (see Appendix B). In 2002, Usishkin, Sondhi, and Huse calculated the thermoelectric response of a quasi-2D type-II superconductor in the Gaussian approximation, in the limits of H\to 0 and T\to T_{c}[18]. In 2009, calculations of \alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy} in a dirty 2D type-II superconductor were extended to arbitrary T and arbitrary H by two groups independently [19, 20], who arrived at similar results. We now compare the magnitude and field dependence of N_{\rm sc} measured in PCCO with the latest predictions of Gaussian theory.

#### v.3.1 Magnitude

In the limit of H\to 0 and T\to T_{c}, \alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy} above T_{c} is given, in two dimensions, by [19]

\[\alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy}=\frac{2}{3}\frac{k_{\rm B}e}{h}\frac{H}{\tilde{H}_{\rm c 2}(0)}\frac{1}{e},\] (6)

where k_{\rm B}e/h=3.33 nA/K is the quantum of thermoelectric conductance [54, 16]\tilde{H}_{\rm c2}(0)=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\,\xi^{2}(0), and \epsilon=(T-T_{\rm c})/T_{\rm c}. The magnitude of \alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy} is seen to depend on one quantity only, the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length \xi(0), so that \alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy}\sim\xi^{2}(0) as mentioned in Sec. V.2. To make contact with experiment, we use the relation H_{c2}\simeq 0.59\,\tilde{H}_{\rm c2}(0)[53], and the empirical facts that H_{c2}(0)=H_{\rm vs}(0) and H_{\rm vs}(0)=H^{\star}_{c2} (for a single large circular Fermi surface). This yields a theoretical expression where the only input parameter is H^{\star}_{c2}:

\[\text{Theory:}\quad\frac{\alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy}}{H}\simeq 0.4\frac{k_{\rm B}e}{h} \frac{1}{H^{\star}_{c2}}\frac{1}{e}.\] (7)

The measured value of \alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy} is determined using

\[\text{Experiment:}\quad\frac{\alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy}}{H}\simeq\frac{\nu^{\rm sc}_ {0}}{\rho_{\Box}},\] (8)

where \nu^{\rm sc}_{0}=\nu_{0}-\nu^{\rm sp}_{0} is the superconducting Nernst coefficient in the H\to 0 limit (Fig. 12), and \rho_{\Box}=\rho/s, in terms of the zero-field electrical resistivity \rho (Fig. 1) and the interlayer separation s=6.1 A.

In Fig. 15, we plot the theoretical and experimental values of \alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy}/H at \epsilon=0.1, using the values of H^{\star}_{c2} given in Table 1 and the measured values of \nu^{\rm sc}_{0} and \rho given in Table 2, respectively. The agreement between theory and experiment is remarkable. Although a number of factors not considered here (e.g., s wave versus d wave) could alter this quantitative agreement somewhat, it is nevertheless evident that Gaussian theory can reliably explain not only the magnitude of N_{\rm sc} in PCCO, but also its detailed doping dependence. In particular, it shows that there is no qualitative difference between the superconducting fluctuations of the underdoped regime relative to the overdoped regime. The fluctuations are Gaussian everywhere, meaning that the superconducting order parameter fluctuates in both amplitude and phase in the same way across the phase diagram. This therefore rules out the long-held notion that phase fluctuations play a special role in underdoped cuprates [2].

#### v.3.2 Field dependence

One may ask whether the fluctuations at high field might be different from those close to H=0 that were considered in the previous section. In the conventional superconductor Nb_{\rm a}Si_{1-x}, direct comparison [20] of the calculated \alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy} and the measured N_{\rm sc} (Refs. [16, 17]) showed detailed quantitative

Figure 15: (Color online) Comparison of measured [full red circles; Eq. (8)] and calculated [full blue squares; Eq. (7)] values of \alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy}/H vs x. Open blue squares are the values calculated using H_{\rm vs}(0) instead of H^{\star}_{c2} in Eq. (7). The agreement between experiment and theory, with no adjustable parameter, is remarkable.

  agreement, validating the theory of Gaussian fluctuations at arbitrary H.

In Fig. 16, we reproduce the calculated curve of \alpha_{xy}^{sc} versus H at T=1.08\ T_{c}[20]. It shows the characteristic rise and fall, with a peak at some field H^{\star}. The curve is normalized at H^{\star} for both axes, allowing us to compare with our data for N_{\rm sc} versus H, normalized in the same way. In Fig. 16, we perform this comparison for the two dopings at which the Fermi surface is not reconstructed, namely, x=0.15 and 0.17. The data are seen to be in perfect agreement with the theoretical curve, for both dopings. This shows that the theory of Gaussian fluctuations continues to be valid in PCCO well beyond the limit of small fields. We conclude that all aspects of our data in PCCO agree with the theory of Gaussian fluctuations.

Before moving on to the next section, let us comment on the behavior of H^{\star} close to T_{c}. At all dopings, we see that H^{\star} deviates from its \ln(T/T_{c}) dependence as T\to T_{c}, in such a way that H^{\star} saturates to a nonzero value at T=T_{c} or \epsilon=0 (Fig. 10). This is a reflection of the fact that the initial rise in N_{\rm sc} vs H never becomes infinitely rapid, even at \epsilon=0 (Fig. 8, right panels). As can be seen in Fig. 12, the initial slope v_{0} does not diverge as T\to T_{c}, for any doping. On the contrary, v_{0} saturates to a constant value below \epsilon\simeq 0.1. This saturation is entirely expected on theoretical grounds since v\sim\alpha_{xy}^{sc}/\sigma is the ratio of two coefficients that both diverge in the same way as \epsilon\to 0. Indeed, just as \alpha_{xy}^{sc}\propto 1/\epsilon [Eq. (6)], so is \sigma\propto 1/\epsilon[53].

### Comparison with hole-doped cuprates

We have shown that in the electron-doped cuprate PCCO the superconducting fluctuations are Gaussian throughout the doping phase diagram, ruling out phase fluctuations as a mechanism for the T_{c} dome, and superconductivity weakens as soon as Fermi-surface reconstruction sets in, below a critical doping x_{c}. The origin of the T_{c} dome is therefore an underlying growth in the gap \Delta_{0} with decreasing x, curtailed by the onset of a competing phase. This is why the dome is centered around x_{c}. In this section, we investigate to what extent a similar scenario applies to hole-doped cuprates.

#### iii.4.1 FSR and the origin of the T_{c} dome

The first thing to note is that hole-doped cuprates also undergo a FSR below some critical doping p_{c}[46, 47]. This was revealed unambiguously by the discovery of low-frequency quantum oscillations in YBCO [55], shown to come from a small electronlike pocket in the Fermi surface of underdoped YBCO, because of the large negative Hall coefficient R_{H} at low temperature [56]. In the normal state, once superconductivity has been removed by application of a large magnetic field, the electron pocket is seen to persist as a function of doping up to at least p=0.15[57]. Given that hole-doped cuprates above p\simeq 0.25 are known to have a single large holelike Fermi surface [58, 59, 37] (very similar to that of electron-doped cuprates at high x), the FSR in the normal state at T=0 must take place at a critical doping p_{c} such that 0.15<p_{c}<0.25.

In YBCO, the onset of this FSR upon cooling is rather gradual, as it is in PCCO, and it may be said to occur at the temperature T_{\rm max} below which R_{H}(T) starts to fall towards negative values [57]. The fact that the T_{\rm max} line and the T_{c} line cross where the latter peaks is strong evidence that the the drop of T_{c} on the underdoped side is linked to the FSR [57, 31].

The temperature-doping phase diagram of YBCO is therefore similar to that of PCCO (Fig. 2), in the sense that the onset of FSR extrapolates to a critical point at T=0 which lies just above optimal doping (where T_{c} peaks). So, the origin of the T_{c} dome in hole-doped cuprates appears to be fundamentally the same as in electron-doped cuprates, namely, phase competition and FSR below a quantum critical point located inside the dome. Note, however, that the competing order itself may be different.

#### iii.4.2 Critical field H_{c2} and critical doping p_{c}

To investigate the comparison further, we examine the doping dependence of critical fields in hole-doped cuprates. The upper critical field H_{c2} was recently determined by thermal conductivity measurements in YBCO, YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}, and Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6} (Tl-2201) [31]. The data revealed that H_{c2}=H_{\rm x3}(0), as confirmed here in PCCO at x=0.15. Using high-field measurements of H_{\rm vs}(T), the complete doping dependence of H_{c2} was reported; the data are reproduced in Fig. 17. We see that H_{c2} versus p exhibits two peaks, pointing to two underlying quantum critical points, possibly associated with the onset of two distinct competing phases [31]. Here, we focus on the higher peak, at p_{c}=0.18. Starting from high doping, we see that H_{c2} rises from zero at p\simeq 0.27 up to H_{c2}=150\pm 20 T at p_{c}. In this overdoped regime, the ratio H_{c2}/T_{c}^{2} is roughly constant (Fig. 14), showing that the growth in the gap magnitude \Delta_{0} controls the rise of T_{c} and H_{c2}, as we found in overdoped PCCO.

Moreover, the value of the ratio is roughly the same in both hole-doped and electron-doped materials, namely, H_{c2}/T_{c}^{2}\simeq 18 mT/K^{2} (Fig. 14). This may be somewhat coincidental since H_{c2} depends on the Fermi velocity v_{F} and the mean-free path

Figure 16: (Color online) Superconducting Nernst signal of PCCO in the absence of FSR, plotted as a function of magnetic field for the overdoped (x=0.17; red) and optimally doped (x=0.15; blue) samples, measured at T=1.08\ T_{c} in both cases. The data are compared to the theoretical calculation of \alpha_{xy}^{sc} (green curve, from Ref. [20]). For both experimental data and calculated curve, the x axis is normalized by the peak field H^{\star} and the y axis is normalized by the magnitude of the superconducting Nernst signal at H^{\star}. The agreement between theory and experiment is excellent.

  l (see Appendix A), and these parameters may not be identical in YBCO or Tl-2201 and in PCCO, but it nevertheless explains why H_{c2} in PCCO is so much smaller than in YBCO. Indeed, a factor 5 smaller T_{c}, from T_{c}\simeq 100 K to T_{c}\simeq 20 K, will yield a factor 25 smaller H_{c2}, from H_{c2}\simeq 150 T to H_{c2}\simeq 6 T, as roughly observed.

Below p_{c}=0.18, H_{c2} in YBCO drops by a factor 6, down to H_{c2}=24\pm 2 T at p=0.11[31]. The condensation energy \delta E drops by a factor 20, and the ratio \delta E/T_{c}^{2} by a factor 8 [31]. This dramatic suppression of superconductivity is attributed to phase competition, involving the onset of charge order [31, 63, 64]. The value of p_{c} is consistent with the onset of FSR at T=0, as estimated from R_{H}[57].

As seen in Fig. 14, the FSR in YBCO causes a _drop_ in the ratio H_{c2}/T_{c}^{2}, at least initially, whereas the FSR in PCCO causes an increase. The difference is likely to come at least in part from the different effect of FSR on the Fermi velocity v_{F}. We mentioned that in PCCO v_{F} undergoes a large change, by an order of magnitude. In YBCO, however, quantum oscillation measurements give only a factor 2 drop in v_{F} upon FSR, if we compare overdoped Tl-2201 (p\simeq 0.25; Ref. [65]) and underdoped YBCO (p=0.11; Ref. [66]). The difference could also come from a different topology of the reconstructed Fermi surface. While the electron pocket in the Fermi surface of PCCO is located at (\pi,0), where the d-wave gap is maximal, the electron pocket in the Fermi surface of YBCO is quite possibly located at (\pi/2,\pi/2), where the gap goes to zero [67].

#### iv.2.3 Superconducting fluctuations

Superconducting fluctuations in hole-doped cuprates have been studied extensively, mostly via measurements of the electrical resistivity, the magnetization, and the Nernst effect. An exhaustive study of paraconductivity in YBCO by Ando and co-workers showed that Gaussian theory (Aslamazov-Larkin) accounts well for the effect of superconducting fluctuations above T_{c}[60]. From their analysis, justified in light of other works [68, 69], they extract a coherence length \xi as a function of doping, and use it to estimate the critical field \tilde{H}_{c2}(0)=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi^{2}. A later study by Rullier-Albenque and co-workers, based on a similar analysis, yielded \tilde{H}_{c2}(0) values in good agreement with the earlier work, at least for p<0.15[61]. For p>0.15, the use of higher magnetic fields in the more recent study may have improved the estimate of the underlying normal-state magnetoresistance [70]. In Fig. 17, we plot H_{c2}\simeq 0.59\tilde{H}_{c2}(0) obtained from the data of both groups on the H-p diagram of YBCO. We also plot H_{c2} obtained from recent magnetization measurements analyzed using Gaussian theory to extract the coherence length [62]. The agreement between H_{c2} obtained from direct measurements of H_{\rm vs} at low temperature and high fields and H_{c2} encoded in the superconducting fluctuations above T_{c} is remarkable. In particular, it exhibits the same two-peak structure and the same sixfold drop between p=0.18 and 0.11.

The Nernst response of hole-doped cuprates was recently revisited and shown to be in excellent agreement with the Gaussian theory [21]. Figures 18 and 19 show how the behavior of N_{\rm sc} in the hole-doped cuprate Eu-LSCO is qualitatively identical to that of electron-doped PCCO, as a function of field and temperature, respectively.

We conclude that superconducting fluctuations in cuprates are well described by Gaussian theory, whether in electron-doped or hole-doped materials, whether in the overdoped or underdoped regimes. This may no longer be true at very low doping, i.e., p<0.08 and x<0.13, when close to the Mott insulator, but otherwise it appears that using the standard theory is a reliable way to extract fundamental information about superconductivity in the cuprates. Previous analyses of

First, directly from resistive measurements of H_{\rm vs}(T) at low temperature in high magnetic fields, extrapolated to T=0, giving H_{c2}=H_{\rm vs}(0) (blue symbols) [31]. The open circles are for YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} (p=0.14) and Tl-2201 (p>0.21) [31]. Second, we plot 0.59\tilde{H}_{c2}(0) (red symbols) with \tilde{H}_{c2}(0)=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi^{2}(0), where the coherence length \xi(0) is obtained from Gaussian Aslamazov-Larkin theory applied above T_{c} to either the conductivity (full squares from Ref. [60], open squares from Ref. [61]) or the magnetization (open diamonds, from Ref. [62]). The agreement between the two ways of determining H_{c2} is remarkable.

Figure 18: (Color online) Superconducting Nernst signal of electron-doped PCCO (blue) and hole-doped Eu-LSCO (red), measured at T=1.08T_{c} in both cases, for dopings as indicated. The x axis is normalized by the peak field H^{\star} and the y axis is normalized by the magnitude of the superconducting Nernst signal at H^{\star}. The agreement between the two is excellent, showing that the nature of superconducting fluctuations is basically the same whether cuprates are electron doped or hole doped, and both are well described by Gaussian theory (see Fig. 16).

  paraconductivity and diamagnetism in hole-doped cuprates such as YBCO have also found Gaussian theory to be a good description of the superconducting fluctuations [69, 71, 72].

## VI Summary

Our measurements of the Nernst effect in the electron-doped cuprate superconductor PCCO elucidate the nature of superconducting fluctuations above the critical temperature T_{c}. We find that the superconducting Nernst signal N_{\rm sc} is in qualitative and quantitative agreement with the theory of Gaussian fluctuations in dirty 2D superconductors [18, 19, 20] at all dopings. Indeed, N_{\rm sc}(T,H) in PCCO behaves as it does in the conventional superconductor \rm Nb_{S}Si_{1-x}[16, 17]. This implies that there is nothing unusual about the fluctuations in PCCO, even in the underdoped regime. There is no evidence of any vortexlike excitations, or preformed pairs, above T_{c}.

The characteristic magnetic field scale H_{c2}^{\star} extracted directly from the data independent of any theoretical assumptions displays a domelike dependence on doping, showing the same x dependence as T_{c}, both peaking at x=0.15. This shows that the pairing strength drops below optimal doping. This weakening of superconductivity occurs at the critical doping where the Fermi surface undergoes a reconstruction [22]. The scenario is therefore one of competition with another ordered phase that causes both the Fermi-surface reconstruction and the suppression of T_{c} and H_{c2}^{\star}[31, 46, 47, 73, 74]. Most likely, the competing phase in PCCO is antiferromagnetic order [23].

The emerging picture for PCCO is therefore the same as in quasi-1D organic superconductors, where an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point is clearly the organizing principle [47, 49]. The magnetic fluctuations cause d-wave pairing, while the magnetic order competes with superconductivity. The first effect increases T_{c}, the second decreases T_{c}, and the two together produce the T_{c} dome that straddles the critical point. By analogy, we infer that the same two mechanisms are at play in PCCO, supporting the case for magnetically mediated pairing in cuprates [29, 47]. This is also the likely scenario in iron-based superconductors [50].

A comparison of our Nernst data on PCCO with corresponding data reported for the hole-doped cuprate Eu-LSCO (Ref. [21]) reveals a strong similarity. We conclude that superconducting fluctuations in hole-doped cuprates are not significantly different. This validates the use of Gaussian fluctuation theory in previous analyses of paraconductivity data in underdoped YBCO, which yielded an estimate of H_{c2} that decreases rapidly with underdoping [60, 61], in good agreement with direct measurements of H_{c2} in YBCO [31]. These studies establish that the dominant mechanism for the T_{c} dome in hole-doped cuprates is also phase competition. Interestingly, in this case the competition does not seem to come from magnetic order, but appears to involve charge order [63, 64].

We conclude that fluctuations in the phase of the superconducting order parameter, long invoked as the mechanism responsible for the T_{c} dome of cuprates, do not in fact play a prominent role in the origin of the T_{c} dome of either electron-doped or hole-doped cuprates.

## Appendix A Estimate of H_{c2} in PCCO

Quantum oscillations in the c-axis resistivity of overdoped NCCO at x=0.17 have a frequency F=10\,960 T and a cyclotron mass m^{\star}=2.3m_{0}[44]. Using the Onsager relation

\[F=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi^{2}}A_{k}\] (10)

with \Phi_{0}=2.07\times 10^{-15} Wb, we extract the corresponding values for the Fermi wave vector of the large Fermi surface k_{\rm F}=0.58 A^{-1} and the Fermi velocity v_{\rm H}=\hbar k_{\rm F}/m^{\star}=2.9\times 10^{5} m/s. Using the following relation for the coherence length of a clean superconductor:

\[\xi_{0}^{\rm clean}=\frac{\hbar v_{F}}{a\Delta_{0}}\] (11)

with a=1.5 and \Delta_{0}=2.14k_{\rm B}T_{c} for a d-wave state, we extract the clean limit coherence length \xi_{0}^{\rm clean}=51 nm. Disorder affects the clean limit coherence length if the mean-free path \ell is comparable to \xi_{0}^{\rm clean}. We estimate the mean-free path via the relation

\[\ell=\frac{hs}{e^{2}\rho_{0}k_{F}},\] (12)

Figure 19: (Color online) Comparison of H^{\star} vs \epsilon for electron-doped PCCO (green circles) and hole-doped Eu-LSCO (red circles), at dopings as indicated. The PCCO data are multiplied by a factor 3. The black dotted line is a fit of the data to the function H^{\star}=H_{c2}^{\star}ln(T/T_{c}) [Eq. (4)].

  where \rho_{0} is the residual resistivity. Using the interlayer distance s=6.1 A and \rho_{0}=17.5\,\mu\Omega cm (Fig. 1), we get \ell=15.5 nm. Using Pippard's relation for the coherence length of dirty superconductors

\[\frac{1}{\xi_{0}^{\rm dirty}}=\frac{1}{\xi_{0}^{\rm clean}}+\frac{1}{\ell},\] (10)

we arrive at a coherence length of \xi_{0}^{\rm dirty}=11.9 nm in the dirty limit. We use this value to calculate the upper critical field from the expression:

\[H_{c2}=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi_{0}^{2}}=2.3\ \mathrm{T}.\] (11)

The result is close to our measured value H_{\rm vs}(T\to 0)=3.0\pm 0.2 T, as discussed in Sec. V.2 and presented in Table 1.

## Appendix B Magnitude of S\tan(\theta_{\rm H})

Equation (5) is valid when |S\tan\theta_{\rm H}|\ll N. To verify that this condition is indeed satisfied in our PCCO samples, we have measured the Seebeck effect in our thin films and used the values of R_{H} from Ref. [27] to calculate \tan(\theta_{H}) using \tan(\theta_{\rm H})=R_{\rm H}B/\rho. Table 3 lists the value of |S\tan\theta_{\rm H}|, N, and the ratio of the two quantities at T=4 K and H=15 T for our four samples. The condition |S\tan\theta_{\rm H}|\ll N is seen to hold at all dopings.

###### Abstract

The Nernst effect was measured in the electron-doped cuprate superconductor Pr2-x Ce2CuO4 (PCCO) at four concentrations, from underdoped (x=0.13) to overdoped (x=0.17), for a wide range of temperatures above the critical temperature T_{c}. A magnetic field H up to 15 T was used to reliably access the normal-state quasiparticle contribution to the Nernst signal N_{\rm qp}, which is subtracted from the total signal N, to obtain the superconducting contribution N_{\rm sc}. As a function of H, N_{\rm sc} peaks at a field H^{\star} whose temperature dependence obeys H_{c2}^{\star}\ln(T/T_{c}), as it does in a conventional superconductor such as Nb2Si2... The doping dependence of the characteristic field scale H_{c2}^{\star}, shown to be closely related to the upper critical field H_{c2}, tracks the domelike dependence of T_{c}, showing that superconductivity is weakened below the quantum critical point where the Fermi surface is reconstructed, presumably by the onset of antiferromagnetic order. Our data at all dopings are quantitatively consistent with the theory of Gaussian superconducting fluctuations, eliminating the need to invoke unusual vortexlike excitations above T_{c}, and ruling out phase fluctuations as the mechanism for the fall of T_{c} with underdoping. We compare the properties of PCCO with those of hole-doped cuprates and conclude that the domes of T_{c} and H_{c2} versus doping in the latter materials are also controlled predominantly by phase competition rather than phase fluctuations.

## I Introduction

Cuprate superconductors have attracted enormous attention because they hold the record for the highest critical temperature T_{c}, which can be as high as 164 K, halfway to room temperature [1]. As a function of doping, T_{c} displays a dome-like dependence, reaching a maximal value at some optimal doping. A fundamental question is as follows: Why does T_{c} not continue to rise with underdoping? A long-held scenario is that the pairing strength (and superconducting gap magnitude) does continue to rise, but the critical temperature T_{c} for long-range coherence falls because of increasingly strong fluctuations in the phase of the superconducting order parameter [2]. So, the underlying strength of superconductivity would become greater than suggested by the maximal (optimal) value of T_{c}, and finding ways to increase phase rigidity could further increase the maximal T_{c}.

The main experimental support for this phase fluctuation scenario came from the observation of a sizable Nernst signal above T_{c} in underdoped cuprates such as La2-x Sr2CuO4 (LSCO) [3, 4]. The Nernst effect, the transverse thermoelectric response to a magnetic field, is large in the vortex-liquid state of type-II superconductors, due to the motion of vortices [5]. Consequently, the observation of a large Nernst signal well above T_{c} in hole-doped cuprates was attributed to short-lived vortex excitations above T_{c}[3]. In this picture, Cooper pairs with a finite gap in their excitation spectrum survive to temperatures as high as T\simeq 3T_{c}. Defining the upper critical field H_{c2} needed to suppress superconductivity as the field where the Nernst signal vanishes, H_{c2} was found to increase with underdoping, and this was taken as evidence of a rising gap [6]. A paradigm was born: While the superconducting gap and the upper critical field increase with underdoping, T_{c} decreases due to phase fluctuations.

In recent years, it was shown that the three basic assumptions underlying this interpretation of the Nernst response in cuprates are invalid. The first assumption was that the quasiparticle contribution to the measured Nernst signal N_{\rm qp} is negligible, so that all of the signal can be attributed to superconducting fluctuations. It has since become clear that N_{\rm qp} can in fact be large in a variety of strongly correlated metals [7], including cuprates [8]. For example, Nernst measurements in YBa2Cu3O4 (YBCO) and HgBa2CuO4+3 (Hg1201) reveal a large negative N_{\rm qp}, easily disentangled from N_{\rm sc} because its sign is opposite to that of the superconducting signal [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. In these materials, N_{\rm qp} starts to grow below the pseudogap temperature T^{\star}, and it becomes comparable in magnitude to N_{\rm sc} at T_{c}. In the electron-doped material PCCO, the two contributions are again readily resolved, even though both are positive in this case, because N_{\rm qp} exhibits a peak at high temperature while N_{\rm sc} peaks at T_{c}, which is relatively low in this material [14, 15]. A similar two-peak structure is observed in the hole-doped material La2-x-y Eu3Sr2CuO4 (Eu-LSCO) [8]. In LSCO, the material on which the early studies were based, N_{\rm qp}(T) is very similar to that of Eu-LSCO, but, because T_{c} is higher in LSCO, its peak now merges with the peak in N_{\rm sc}(T), and hence the two contributions are more difficult to disentangle [8].

The second assumption is that N_{\rm sc}(H) vanishes above H_{c2}. Nernst measurements on the conventional superconductor Nb2Si2... have revealed that a superconducting signal can persist to fields as high as H\simeq 4H_{c2} (and to temperatures as high as T\simeq 30T_{c}) [16, 17]. This countered the notion that superconducting fluctuations do not exist above H_{c2}. The third assumption was that fluctuations which persist up to 2-3 T_{c} cannot be the usual Gaussian fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter, and hence these were attributed to unusual vortexlike excitations. In 2009, two groups arrived at a complete theory of Gaussian fluctuations in a dirty two-dimensional (2D) superconductor, extending earlier work [18] to arbitrary temperatures and fields [19, 20]. This theory was able to explain in detail and quantitatively the Nb_{x}Si_{1-x} data, proving that standard fluctuations can indeed persist up to T\gg T_{c} and H\gg H_{c2}.

The failure of these three assumptions and the advent of the new theoretical framework imposed a complete re-examination of the Nernst effect in cuprate superconductors. This started with a study of the hole-doped cuprate Eu-LSCO, in which N_{\rm sc}(T,H) was shown to behave in the same way as it does in Nb_{x}Si_{1-x} and to agree with Gaussian theory [21]. The characteristic field H_{\rm c2}^{\star} extracted directly from the data, which we show here to be approximately equal to H_{c2}, was found to be very low in the underdoped regime. The authors also reanalyzed the published Nernst data on other hole-doped cuprates to show that H_{\rm c2}^{\star} in fact decreases with underdoping [21], in contrast to the prior report of an increasing H_{c2}[6]. However, because the Eu-LSCO study was limited to dopings on the underdoped side of the T_{c} dome, it did not allow for the ultimate test: to compare the nature of superconducting fluctuations on the two sides of the dome, and see whether there is a fundamental difference, or not.

In this paper, we report a study of superconducting fluctuations in the electron-doped cuprate PCCO that extends across the phase diagram, allowing us to compare both sides of the dome. This cuprate offers a major advantage in that its critical magnetic field at all dopings is low enough that fluctuations can be fully suppressed by applying only 15 T, thereby allowing a careful extraction of the underlying quasiparticle contribution N_{\rm qp}. This is essential for a detailed analysis of N_{\rm sc}. We find that N_{\rm sc} obeys Gaussian fluctuation theory quantitatively, compelling evidence that fluctuations in this cuprate are not unusual, on either side of the dome.

We extract H_{\rm c2}^{\star} directly from the N_{\rm sc} data and find that it tracks T_{c} as a function of doping, with H_{\rm c2}^{\star} and T_{c} both showing a dome that peaks at the same critical doping. This doping is where the Fermi surface of PCCO is known to undergo a reconstruction [22], due to the onset of a competing phase that breaks translational symmetry, presumably antiferromagnetic order [23]. We conclude that superconductivity in electron-doped cuprates weakens below optimal doping not because of superconducting phase fluctuations, but because of phase competition. Comparing with the properties of hole-doped cuprates, we argue that the same conclusion applies for hole-doped materials.

## II Previous Work

The Nernst effect in PCCO has been measured previously, on thin films with 0.13\leq x\leq 0.19[14, 15, 24]. A sizable N_{\rm sc} was detected above T_{c} in underdoped samples, but _not_ in overdoped samples. As a result, Gaussian theory was tentatively ruled out and the signal was attributed to phase fluctuations which go away with overdoping. In our study, an improved signal-to-noise ratio and a higher magnetic field allow us to clearly detect N_{\rm sc} in the overdoped regime. We find that there is in fact no qualitative difference between overdoped and underdoped behavior. For x\leq 0.15, our data are consistent with previous data.

## III Methods

We measured four Pr_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-x} thin films to cover underdoped (x=0.13,0.14), optimally doped (x=0.15), and overdoped (x=0.17) compositions. The epitaxial thin films with [001] orientation were grown by pulsed laser deposition on LSAT [(LaAlO_{3})_{0.3}(Sr_{2}AlTaO_{6})_{0.7}] substrates using Cu-rich targets to eliminate parasitic phases [25]. Typical sample dimensions are 3\times 2 mm, with a thickness of 3000 A. The Nernst effect was measured using one heater, one differential thermocouple, and one absolute thermocouple [26]. We used nonmagnetic type-E thermocouples made of chromel and constantan wires. Resistivity measurements were performed in a Quantum Design PPMS. The electrical and thermal currents were applied along the basal plane of the tetragonal crystal structure, and the magnetic field was always applied perpendicular to the basal plane, i.e., along the c axis. The critical temperature T_{c} is defined as the temperature where the resistivity goes to zero; the values are listed in Table 1.

## IV Results

### Resistivity, T_{c}, and T_{\rm min}

Figure 1 displays the resistivity data \rho versus T for our four samples at H=0 to show the superconducting transition and at H=15 T to show the normal-state behavior. The T_{c} values are plotted in Fig. 2. As in all cuprate superconductors, T_{c} has a characteristic domelike dependence on doping. Except at x=0.17, all normal-state resistivity curves \rho(T) show a minimum, at a temperature T_{\rm min} which increases with decreasing x. Figure 2 shows the doping evolution of T_{\rm min}, seen to extrapolate to zero at x=0.16. This is also the critical doping where the normal-state Fermi surface of PCCO at T\to 0 is known to undergo a reconstruction, detected as a sudden change in the Hall coefficient R_{H}, going from small and positive at x>0.16 to large and negative at x\leq 0.16[22, 27]. This Fermi-surface reconstruction (FSR) is attributed to a quantum critical point (QCP) below which some ordered phase sets in, at x_{c}=0.16 (in the absence of superconductivity). Measurements of the Hall coefficient R_{H} at H=15 T in our own thin films find that in the low temperature limit, R_{H}>0 in our sample with x=0.17 and R_{H}<0 in our sample with x=0.15, confirming that the normal-state QCP at which FSR occurs in our samples is x_{c}=0.16\pm 0.01, in excellent agreement with prior data

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} x & T_{c} & H_{\rm tr}(0) & H_{\rm c2}^{\star} \\  & (K) & (T) & (T) \\ \hline
0.13 & 8.8 \pm 0.3 & 3.4 \pm 0.3 & 2.1 \pm 0.2 \\
0.14 & 17.4 \pm 0.1 & 10.1 \pm 0.5 & 4.3 \pm 0.3 \\
0.15 & 19.5 \pm 0.1 & 8.

  [22, 27]. The FSR is also responsible for the upturn in \rho(T) at low T. The resistivity at x=0.17 is strictly linear in T below 40 K, in agreement with previous reports [28, 29]. The absence of any upturn shows that x=0.17 is above the critical doping x_{c}; the linearity shows that it is close to the QCP. Our resistivity data as presented in Figs. 1 and 2 provide a guide to the reconstruction of the Fermi surface in PCCO and form the basis of our discussion in Sec. V.1, where we elaborate on the QCP and the FSR, phenomena that are fundamental for understanding the superconducting phase diagram.

### Vortex-solid melting field H_{\rm vs}

Having displayed the doping dependence of the critical temperature T_{c}, we now turn our attention to a second fundamental quantity, the critical magnetic field needed to suppress superconductivity. We call H_{\rm vs}(T) the critical field above which the electrical resistance of the sample ceases to be zero. In a type-II superconductor such as PCCO, this is the field at which the vortex solid melts, hence the labeling. We measured the resistivity of our PCCO films at different temperatures below T_{c} to track the temperature dependence of H_{\rm vs} at each doping. The resulting field-temperature phase diagram is shown in Fig. 3. At all dopings, H_{\rm vs} has the typical behavior of cuprate superconductors, with positive curvature.

Above the H_{\rm vs}(T) line, the electronic state is a vortex liquid. The question of where this vortex liquid ends in cuprates has been the subject of much debate [30]. Recently, it was shown that measurements of the thermal conductivity can be used to answer that question [31]. In three hole-doped cuprates, it was found that there is no vortex-liquid phase at T\to 0[31]. In other words, with decreasing field, at T=0, vortices appear precisely at H_{\rm vs}(0). This provides a convenient empirical procedure for determining the upper critical field H_{c2}, namely, H_{c2}=H_{\rm vs}(0). Of course, with increasing temperature, the vortex-liquid phase grows.

To extrapolate to T=0, we use the standard expression for the temperature dependence of H_{\rm vs}(T)[32, 33, 34]:

\[\frac{\sqrt{b_{m}(T)}}{1-b_{m}(T)}\frac{t}{\sqrt{1-t}}\biggl{[}\frac{4(\sqrt{2 }-1)}{\sqrt{1-b_{m}(T)}}+1\biggr{]}=\frac{2\pi c_{L}^{2}}{\sqrt{G_{i}}},\] (1)

Figure 3: (Color online) Vortex-solid melting lines as a function of temperature, plotted as H_{\rm vs}(T) vs T/T_{c}, for dopings as indicated. H_{\rm vs}(T) is the field below which the sample resistance is zero (full circles). Solid lines are fits to Eq. (1), used to extrapolate H_{\rm vs}(T) to T=0 and obtain H_{\rm vs}(0), whose value is listed in Table 1. The open circle in the top right panel marks the value of the upper critical field H_{c2} obtained from thermal conductivity data at x=0.15 (see Fig. 4).

Figure 2: (Color online) Temperature-doping phase diagram of PCCO, showing the superconducting dome delineated by the zero-field critical temperature T_{c} (black circles). Also shown is T_{\rm min} (red squares), the temperature at which the resistivity \rho(T) has a minimum (see Fig. 1). The red line is a linear fit to the T_{\rm min} data, extrapolated to T=0 (open square). The corresponding doping x_{c}=0.16 is the quantum critical point below which the Fermi-surface reconstruction (FSR) onsets, in agreement with the critical doping where the normal-state Hall coefficient R_{H} at T\to 0 exhibits a sharp drop to negative values [22]. Throughout our discussion in Sec. V, we will use this figure as a map of FSR in PCCO that is derived from resistivity.

  in terms of the reduced field b_{m}=H_{\rm vs}/H_{\rm vs}(0) and reduced temperature t=T/T_{c}. We use the same definitions for the Ginzburg and Lindemann parameters (G_{i} and c_{L}) as in Ref. [34]. In Fig. 3, we see that Eq. (1) fits the data well and allows us to obtain H_{\rm vs}(0), whose value at each doping is listed in Table 1. The same expression was also found to fit the H_{\rm vs} data of hole-doped cuprates very well, in both underdoped and overdoped regimes [31, 34].

We can use existing thermal conductivity data to confirm that H_{c2} is indeed equal to H_{\rm vs}(T\to 0) in PCCO. In Fig. 4, we reproduce published data taken at T=0.2 K on a single crystal of PCCO at optimal doping (x=0.15, T_{c}=20 K) [35]. We see from those data that H_{c2}=8\pm 1 T, in excellent agreement with the value of H_{\rm vs}(0)=8.9\pm 0.4 T we obtain by extrapolating H_{\rm vs}(T) to T=0 (Fig. 3). A similar value for H_{\rm vs}(0) is reported in prior studies [36].

### Nernst effect: Overdoped sample (x=0.17)

In presenting our Nernst data on PCCO, we begin with the overdoped sample at x=0.17. There are two reasons for this initial focus. First, this sample provides a fundamental reference point for all Nernst studies of cuprate superconductors, missing until now. In an overdoped sample, the Fermi surface is neither reconstructed nor altered by a pseudogap: it is simply a single large holelike cylinder, whose area is precisely given by the doping. In hole-doped cuprates, this k-space area is proportional to 1+p[37]; in PCCO, it is proportional to 1-x[23]. Moreover, in PCCO, we have a particularly simple crystal structure, which is tetragonal and free of bilayers, buckling, oxygen order, or chains [38]. The Nernst data we report here can therefore be regarded as the archetype of an overdoped cuprate, the property of a single pristine CuO_{2} plane. Second, having data in the overdoped regime will enable us to make the first direct comparison of superconducting fluctuations on the left and right sides of the T_{c} dome, and establish the differences, if any.

In Fig. 5, we show the in-plane resistivity \rho(T) of our x=0.17 sample, below 30 K. With increasing temperature, \rho rises suddenly at T_{c}=13.4 K. Above T_{c}, there is a regime of paraconductivity, where superconducting fluctuations reduce the resistivity from its normal-state value. The data at H=15 T provide the normal-state reference, _modulo_ a small rigid shift in \rho(T) due to a positive orbital magnetoresistance. Note that paraconductivity can be seen up to 2 T_{c} or so (see inset of Fig. 5).

The raw Nernst signal N as a function of field is shown in Fig. 6(a), at T=1.08T_{c}. N(H) shows an initial rise with a subsequent fall on top of a smoothly increasing background. The peak at low field is due to superconducting fluctuations N_{\rm sc}, while the background is the normal-state quasiparticle signal N_{\rm qp}. The total Nernst signal is the sum of these two components:

\[N=N_{\rm sc}+N_{\rm qp}.\] (2)

To establish the background for each isotherm, we fit the data above 10 T to a power law:

\[N_{\rm qp}=a(T)H+b(T)H^{3}.\] (3)

The dotted line in Fig. 6(a) is a fit to Eq. (3). We see that it describes the raw data very well from \sim6 T all the way to 15 T. Note that a cubic term is essential to capture the correct H dependence of N_{\rm qp}. In previous work, limited to lower fields [15], N_{\rm qp} was assumed to have a purely linear dependence, but in principle all odd powers of H are allowed by symmetry.

In Fig. 6(b), we plot the superconducting signal N_{\rm sc}=N-N_{\rm qp}. It rises rapidly from zero, goes through a peak, and then decreases gradually, to eventually become vanishingly small at high field, for H>2H_{c2} or so. [It has been suggested that there may be an intrinsic limit to how high superconducting fluctuations can extend above H_{c2} (or T_{c}), associated with the uncertainty principle [39, 40].] This is a

Figure 4: (Color online) Thermal conductivity \kappa as a function of magnetic field H, measured at T=0.2 K on a single crystal of PCCO with x=0.15 (T_{c}=20 K) (data from Ref. [35]). The saturation of \kappa vs H marks the end of the vortex state, providing a direct measurement of the upper critical field H_{c2}, defined as the field above which vortices disappear [31], giving H_{c2}=8\pm 1 T.

Figure 5: (Color online) Resistivity of our PCCO sample with x=0.17. The critical temperature is defined as the temperature where the zero-field data (red) go to zero: T_{c}=13.4 K. The normal-state behavior is given by the data in a field H=15 T (blue), which includes a slight rigid upward shift due to positive magnetoresistance. A regime of paraconductivity is detectable below T\simeq 2T_{c}, due to superconducting fluctuations that gradually decrease \rho(T), before its rapid drop to zero at T_{c}. Inset: zoom on paraconductivity: \Delta\rho\equiv\rho(0)-\rho(15\Gamma) vs T.

  typical signal for a superconductor. In fact, N_{\rm sc} displays these same features in all superconductors, at T>T_{c}. In particular, there is always a peak field, which we label H^{\star}. We see that H^{\star} is a characteristic field scale for superconductivity in a given material that is directly and immediately obtainable from the data, with no assumptions and no model or theory.

As a function of temperature, N_{\rm sc} decreases in magnitude, but the peak field H^{\star} increases. In Fig. 7, we show on a field-temperature phase diagram the temperature dependence of H^{\star} above T_{c}, and also H_{\rm vs}(T) measured on the same sample, below T_{c}. In addition, we sketch the temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_{c2}(T). H^{\star}(T) and H_{c2}(T) are images of each other on either side of T_{c}, and for this reason H^{\star} has been called the "ghost critical field" [41]. The H^{\star} data can be fit to a logarithmic dependence, such that

\[H^{\star}=H^{\star}_{c2}\ln(T/T_{c}).\] (4)

The prefactor H^{\star}_{c2} is a single empirical parameter that characterizes the strength of superconductivity.

The \ln(T/T_{c}) dependence in Eq. (4) was explained intuitively by Pourret _et al._ in the context of {\rm Nb_{x}Si_{1-x}} thin films [17]. They proposed that the crossover from increasing to decreasing N_{\rm sc} occurs because the length scale for superconducting fluctuations at low H is set by the coherence length \xi(T), while at high H it is set by the magnetic length \ell_{B}\!=\!\sqrt{\hbar/eH}. H^{\star} would be the field where the two length scales become comparable, i.e., \xi(H^{\star})\!\simeq\!\ell_{B}(H^{\star}). Since \xi(T)\propto 1/\sqrt{\ln(T/T_{c})} and \ell_{B}(H^{\star})\propto 1/\sqrt{H^{\star}}, this yields H^{\star}\propto\ln(T/T_{c}).

The one-parameter fit to the x\!=\!0.17 data in Fig. 7 using Eq. (4) yields H^{\star}_{c2}\!=\!3.0\pm 0.3 T (Table 1). (Note that the data deviate from the fit close to T_{c}, an intrinsic effect explained in Sec. V.3) This value can be compared with our estimate of H_{c2} for that same sample, obtained as the T\!=\!0 limit of the resistive critical field H_{\rm vs}(T), whose value is H_{\rm vs}(0)=3.0\pm 0.2 T (see Table 1 and Figs. 3 and 7). We arrive at a useful empirical result: The characteristic field scale encoded in superconducting fluctuations above T_{c}, when defined as in Eq. (4), is equal to the field needed to kill superconductivity at T\!=\!0. In other words, we now have a straightforward empirical procedure for measuring the fundamental field scale for superconductivity H_{c2}, from superconducting fluctuations above T_{c}. Note that this is for a single-band d-wave superconductor.

In summary, superconducting fluctuations in overdoped PCCO, at x\!=\!0.17, are detectable in N_{\rm sc} up to T\!\simeq\!2T_{c} and H\!\simeq\!2H_{c2}, and they can be used to measure H_{c2}. What is the nature of these fluctuations? As we show in Sec. V, not only does N_{\rm sc} have precisely the field dependence predicted by Gaussian theory, its magnitude is in excellent agreement with theoretical expectations. We conclude that the

The black dotted line is a polynomial fit to the data above 10 T, of the form N_{\rm qp}=a(T)H+b(T)H^{\star}. N_{\rm qp} is the quasiparticle background of the underlying normal state. (b) Superconducting contribution to the Nernst signal, defined as N_{\rm sc}=N-N_{\rm qp} [Eq. (2)]. For any given temperature above T_{c}, N_{\rm sc} vs H exhibits a peak, at a field labeled H^{\star} (arrow).

Figure 7: (Color online) Magnetic field-temperature phase diagram of PCCO at x=0.17. The peak field H^{\star} (full red dots) is plotted above T_{c} (vertical black line). The solid red line is a fit of the H^{\star} vs T data, to the formula H^{\star}=H^{\star}_{c2}\ln(T/T_{c}) [Eq. (4)]. The vortex-solid melting field H_{\rm vs}(T) (open circles) is the boundary between the vortex-solid phase (VS), where the electrical resistance is zero, and the vortex-liquid phase (VL), where the resistance is nonzero. The upper critical field H_{c2} (green dotted line) is the boundary between the vortex liquid and the normal state, where there are no vortices. At T=0, there is no vortex liquid since H_{c2}(0)=H_{\rm vs}(0), as reported for hole-doped cuprates [31], and shown here for PCCO at x=0.15 (Figs. 3 and 4). The green dotted line is a schematic representation. Note that the two characteristic field scales for superconductivity, obtained, respectively, at T\to 0 and at T>T_{c}, are equal for x=0.17, namely, H_{c2}(0)=H^{\star}_{c2}=3.0 T (Table 1).

  superconducting fluctuations of an overdoped cuprate are now well understood.

### Nernst effect: All dopings (0.13\leqslant x\leqslant 0.17)

The left panels of Fig. 8 present a selection of raw Nernst isotherms, labeled by their reduced temperature \epsilon\equiv(T-T_{\rm c})/T_{\rm c}, for each of the four samples. The superconducting Nernst signal N_{\rm sc} is shown in the corresponding right panels. Examples of background subtraction are given in Fig. 9, for x=0.13 and 0.14. As in the x=0.17 sample, there is a large positive N_{\rm qp}, mostly linear in H, but with a small additional H^{3} term. The peak field H^{\star} obtained from N_{\rm sc} versus H is plotted versus \epsilon in Fig. 10 for the four dopings. A fit to Eq. (4) yields the H^{\star}_{22} values listed in Table 1, and plotted versus x in Fig. 11. For all x, the data deviate from the fit as T\to T_{\rm c}, for reasons given in Sec. V.3. In Fig. 12(a), we plot the Nernst coefficient v, defined as v\equiv N/H, versus H. We see that it is flat at low H, i.e., N is linear as H\to 0. In Fig. 12(b), we plot the initial value of v(H), which we call v_{0}, versus \epsilon. In Table 2, we list the values of v_{0} for the four dopings, at \epsilon=0.1, and compare these to theoretical expectations in Sec. V.3.

Figure 8: (Color online) Left panels: Raw Nernst data as a function of field for our four samples, at dopings as indicated. For each doping, we present seven isotherms, at \epsilon=0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.4, where \epsilon=(T-T_{\rm c})/T_{\rm c}, with T_{\rm c} as indicated. Right panels: Superconducting contribution to the Nernst signal N_{\rm sc}, obtained by subtracting the normal-state background N_{\rm qp}, as shown in Figs. 6 and 9, according to Eqs. (2) and (3). Note that with increasing temperature, the magnitude of N_{\rm sc} decreases and the peak field H^{\star} moves up. H^{\star} is plotted vs \epsilon in Fig. 10.

Figure 10: (Color online) Temperature dependence of the peak field H^{\star} in PCCO, at dopings as indicated, plotted as a function of \epsilon\equiv(T-T_{\rm c})/T_{\rm c}. H^{\star} is the field at which N_{\rm sc} peaks, in isotherms of N_{\rm sc} vs H as shown in the right panels of Fig. 8. The lines are a fit of the data to the function H^{\star}=H^{\star}_{2}\ln(T/T_{\rm c}) [Eq. (4)]. The fit allows us to extract a single characteristic field H^{\star}_{22} from the superconducting fluctuations at each doping, directly from the data. The values of the single fit parameter H^{\star}_{22} are listed in Table 1 and plotted vs x in Fig. 11. At low \epsilon, the data deviate from the fit for reasons given in Sec. V.3.

  Figure 11: (Color online) The two magnetic field scales of superconductivity in PCCO, plotted as a function of doping (Table 1). H_{\rm vs}(0) (blue squares), the zero-temperature value of the upper critical field, is obtained by extrapolating to T=0 the vortex-solid melting field H_{\rm vs}(T) below which the resistance is zero (see Fig. 3). The field scale H_{c2}^{*} (red circles) is obtained from the superconducting fluctuations above T_{c} (see Fig. 10). Note that H_{c2}^{*}=H_{\rm vs}(0) at x=0.17.

Figure 12: (Color online) (a) Raw Nernst coefficient v\equiv N/H of PCCO at x=0.15, for selected isotherms above T_{c}, as indicated. In the limit H\to 0, v(H) becomes flat, reaching a constant value v_{0} given by the dashed line. (b) Temperature dependence of v_{0} (dots), at dopings as indicated, plotted as a function of \epsilon. The solid lines are the normal-state contribution to v_{0}, i.e., v_{\rm qp}=N_{\rm qp}/H in the limit H\to 0. Note that v_{0} saturates below \epsilon\simeq 0.1, as expected from Gaussian theory in the limit T\to T_{c} (see Sec. V.3).

In the normal state at T\to 0, achieved by applying a field H>H_{c2}, R_{H} undergoes a sudden and dramatic change below x_{c}= 0.16. It goes from small and positive to large and negative [22]. ARPES measurements on NCCO reveal a transformation as sketched in Fig. 13, whereby the large holelike cylinder of the overdoped regime is reconstructed into two small pockets, respectively located at (\pi,0) and (\pi/2,\pi/2), as the doping is reduced below x\simeq 0.16[43]. This reconstruction is consistent with the observation of low-frequency quantum oscillations in NCCO [44], which reveal the existence of a small closed pocket in the Fermi surface, tentatively attributed to the pocket seen by ARPES near (\pi/2,\pi/2).

The evidence so far is consistent with a Fermi-surface reconstruction caused by the onset of a density-wave order with a wave vector Q = (\pi,\pi) [23], which could well be the commensurate Neel antiferromagnetic order observed by neutrons at low x[45]. In this case, the pocket at (\pi,0) is electronlike and the pocket at (\pi/2,\pi/2) is holelike. One generically expects a Lifshitz transition to occur at a doping well below x_{c}, where the holelike pocket disappears, leaving only the electronlike pocket at (\pi,0) (see Fig. 13) [23].

The FSR described here will affect all transport properties. In addition to the dramatic changes in R_{H}, the resistivity \rho also shows signatures of FSR, in particular the upturn in \rho(T) seen at low temperature (Fig. 1), which we attribute to the loss of carrier density. The temperature T_{\rm min} of the minimum in \rho(T) may then be viewed roughly as the onset of FSR as a function of temperature (Fig. 2). In the resistivity, the onset of FSR at T=0 also occurs at x_{c}=0.16, where T_{\rm min}\to 0, in agreement with the R_{H}(0) data, but at T=20 K it only occurs at x=0.15 (see Fig. 2). In other words, the Fermi surface of PCCO at x=0.15 may be considered unreconstructed for T>T_{c}.

For our study of superconductivity, what we immediately note is that T_{c} falls with underdoping as soon as it crosses the T_{\rm min} line (Fig. 2). This strongly suggests that the cause of the T_{c} dome is the FSR or, more fundamentally, whatever causes the FSR. In the following sections, we bring support to this scenario of phase competition in two different ways: first, by showing that the characteristic field H_{c2}^{\star} also falls below x=0.15, forming a dome just like the T_{c} dome; second, by showing that the superconducting fluctuations on both sides of the dome are not qualitatively different. These observations remove the need to invoke the emergence of phase fluctuations on the underdoped side.

### Characteristic field H_{c2}^{\star} and critical field H_{c2}

In Fig. 11, we plot H_{c2}^{\star} as a function of x. This is the field scale encoded in the superconducting fluctuations just above T_{c}. We see that H_{c2}^{\star} tracks T_{c}, both showing a dome peaking at the same doping, namely, x=0.15. As already mentioned, this is the doping where FSR onsets for T\simeq 20 K (see Fig. 2). This shows that what causes T_{c} to fall below x=0.15 also causes H_{c2}^{\star} to fall, i.e., the coherence length \xi to increase. Note that \xi is an average of v_{F}/\Delta over the Fermi surface, where v_{F} is the Fermi velocity and \Delta is the gap magnitude, so that changes in either v_{F} or \Delta (or both) will affect \xi, and hence H_{c2}^{\star}.

Let us examine the evolution of H_{c2}^{\star} more closely. At T=20 K, the Fermi surface is not reconstructed in going from x=0.17 to 0.15, so the Fermi-surface average of v_{F} should be mostly unchanged. Therefore, the increase in H_{c2}^{\star} from 3.0 to 5.4 T must be due to an increase in \Delta. We can check that by looking at the ratio H_{c2}^{\star}/T_{c}^{2}, which should remain constant if only \Delta changes since (in a simple model) H_{c2}^{\star}\sim\Delta^{2} and T_{c}\sim\Delta. At x=0.17 and 0.15, H_{c2}^{\star}/T_{c}^{2}=17\pm 2 mT/K^{2} and 14\pm 1 mT/K^{2}, respectively. We see that within error bars, the rise in both H_{c2}^{\star} and T_{c} is driven entirely by an increase in \Delta. Moreover, the magnitude of H_{c2}^{\star} is consistent with expectation for a dirty d-wave superconductor. Indeed, using H_{c2}^{\star}\simeq\Phi_{0}/2\pi\,\xi_{0}^{2} and expressions for \xi_{0} given in Appendix A, we estimate that H_{c2}^{\star}=2.3 and 5.1 T for x=0.17 and 0.15, compared to measured values of 3.0 \pm 0.3 T and 5.4 \pm 0.3 T, respectively. In summary, we understand the magnitude and doping dependence of H_{c2}^{\star} in PCCO when its Fermi surface is _not_ reconstructed.

Let us now see what happens when the Fermi surface _is_ reconstructed. The Fermi surface changes from a single large pocket with a large v_{F} to two small pockets with a much smaller v_{F}[44]. This will boost H_{c2}^{\star} and H_{\rm vs}(0), so the fact that H_{c2}^{\star} nevertheless falls below x=0.15 implies that \Delta must necessarily decrease. In Fig. 14, a plot of the ratio H_{\rm vs}(0)/T_{c}^{2} versus x reveals that the enhancement of H_{\rm vs}(0) due to the smaller v_{F} gets gradually stronger with underdoping.

Note that when the Fermi surface changes we expect the ratio H_{\rm vs}(0)/H_{c2}^{\star} to change because H_{\rm vs}(0) is controlled by those k-space regions with the smallest \xi, while N_{\rm sc}, and hence H_{c2}^{\star}, is dominated by those regions with the largest \xi [see Eq. (6) in Sec. V.3 and the discussion that follows], and the relative proportion of these regions will change. In Fig. 11, we see that while H_{\rm vs}(0)=H_{c2}^{\star} at x=0.17, the FSR causes H_{\rm vs}(0) to become larger than H_{c2}^{\star} and drop at slightly lower doping compared to H_{c2}^{\star} due to the details of FSR. Nevertheless, the main point is that the low value of H_{c2} at x=0.13 is clear

  evidence that the gap is smaller at that doping (x=0.13), than it is at x=0.15.

The emerging picture is the following. With decreasing x, starting at x\simeq 0.2, the d-wave gap \Delta_{0} grows, causing T_{\rm c} and H_{\rm c2} to grow, until a critical doping where FSR sets in, whereupon superconductivity is weakened, and both T_{\rm c} and H_{\rm c2} fall. The FSR is due to the onset of a density-wave state that breaks translational symmetry, and fundamentally it is this second phase that competes with superconductivity [46, 47]. This type of phase competition scenario is observed in several families of unconventional superconductors, including the quasi-1D organic metals [48, 49], the quasi-2D iron-based superconductors [50], and the quasi-3D heavy-fermion metals [51, 52], where in all cases the competing phase is a spin-density wave. The organizing principle in such a scenario is the QCP where the second phase sets in, invariably located inside the T_{c} dome. We conclude that the fundamental mechanism for a dome of T_{c} versus doping in PCCO is again phase competition, most likely also with a phase of antiferromagnetic order [38].

### Comparison to theory of Gaussian fluctuations

Until now, we have extracted information from N_{\rm sc} without having recourse to any theory or model or assumption. We simply obtained H^{\star} directly from the data of N_{\rm sc} versus H, and then obtained H^{\star}_{\rm c2} directly from the T dependence of H^{\star}. In this section, we compare our data in PCCO to the standard (Aslamazov-Larkin) theory of superconducting fluctuations [53].

The calculated quantity is the superconducting contribution to the transverse thermoelectric conductivity \alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy}, while the measured quantity is N_{\rm sc}. The two are related as

\[\alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy}\simeq\frac{N_{\rm sc}}{\rho},\] (5)

assuming |\,S\tan\theta_{H}\,|\ll\,N (see Appendix B). In 2002, Usishkin, Sondhi, and Huse calculated the thermoelectric response of a quasi-2D type-II superconductor in the Gaussian approximation, in the limits of H\to 0 and T\to T_{c}[18]. In 2009, calculations of \alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy} in a dirty 2D type-II superconductor were extended to arbitrary T and arbitrary H by two groups independently [19, 20], who arrived at similar results. We now compare the magnitude and field dependence of N_{\rm sc} measured in PCCO with the latest predictions of Gaussian theory.

#### v.3.1 Magnitude

In the limit of H\to 0 and T\to T_{c}, \alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy} above T_{c} is given, in two dimensions, by [19]

\[\alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy}=\frac{2}{3}\frac{k_{\rm B}e}{h}\frac{H}{\tilde{H}_{\rm c 2}(0)}\frac{1}{e},\] (6)

where k_{\rm B}e/h=3.33 nA/K is the quantum of thermoelectric conductance [54, 16]\tilde{H}_{\rm c2}(0)=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\,\xi^{2}(0), and \epsilon=(T-T_{\rm c})/T_{\rm c}. The magnitude of \alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy} is seen to depend on one quantity only, the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length \xi(0), so that \alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy}\sim\xi^{2}(0) as mentioned in Sec. V.2. To make contact with experiment, we use the relation H_{c2}\simeq 0.59\,\tilde{H}_{\rm c2}(0)[53], and the empirical facts that H_{c2}(0)=H_{\rm vs}(0) and H_{\rm vs}(0)=H^{\star}_{c2} (for a single large circular Fermi surface). This yields a theoretical expression where the only input parameter is H^{\star}_{c2}:

\[\text{Theory:}\quad\frac{\alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy}}{H}\simeq 0.4\frac{k_{\rm B}e}{h} \frac{1}{H^{\star}_{c2}}\frac{1}{e}.\] (7)

The measured value of \alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy} is determined using

\[\text{Experiment:}\quad\frac{\alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy}}{H}\simeq\frac{\nu^{\rm sc}_ {0}}{\rho_{\Box}},\] (8)

where \nu^{\rm sc}_{0}=\nu_{0}-\nu^{\rm sp}_{0} is the superconducting Nernst coefficient in the H\to 0 limit (Fig. 12), and \rho_{\Box}=\rho/s, in terms of the zero-field electrical resistivity \rho (Fig. 1) and the interlayer separation s=6.1 A.

In Fig. 15, we plot the theoretical and experimental values of \alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy}/H at \epsilon=0.1, using the values of H^{\star}_{c2} given in Table 1 and the measured values of \nu^{\rm sc}_{0} and \rho given in Table 2, respectively. The agreement between theory and experiment is remarkable. Although a number of factors not considered here (e.g., s wave versus d wave) could alter this quantitative agreement somewhat, it is nevertheless evident that Gaussian theory can reliably explain not only the magnitude of N_{\rm sc} in PCCO, but also its detailed doping dependence. In particular, it shows that there is no qualitative difference between the superconducting fluctuations of the underdoped regime relative to the overdoped regime. The fluctuations are Gaussian everywhere, meaning that the superconducting order parameter fluctuates in both amplitude and phase in the same way across the phase diagram. This therefore rules out the long-held notion that phase fluctuations play a special role in underdoped cuprates [2].

#### v.3.2 Field dependence

One may ask whether the fluctuations at high field might be different from those close to H=0 that were considered in the previous section. In the conventional superconductor Nb_{\rm a}Si_{1-x}, direct comparison [20] of the calculated \alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy} and the measured N_{\rm sc} (Refs. [16, 17]) showed detailed quantitative

Figure 15: (Color online) Comparison of measured [full red circles; Eq. (8)] and calculated [full blue squares; Eq. (7)] values of \alpha^{\rm sc}_{xy}/H vs x. Open blue squares are the values calculated using H_{\rm vs}(0) instead of H^{\star}_{c2} in Eq. (7). The agreement between experiment and theory, with no adjustable parameter, is remarkable.

  agreement, validating the theory of Gaussian fluctuations at arbitrary H.

In Fig. 16, we reproduce the calculated curve of \alpha_{xy}^{sc} versus H at T=1.08\ T_{c}[20]. It shows the characteristic rise and fall, with a peak at some field H^{\star}. The curve is normalized at H^{\star} for both axes, allowing us to compare with our data for N_{\rm sc} versus H, normalized in the same way. In Fig. 16, we perform this comparison for the two dopings at which the Fermi surface is not reconstructed, namely, x=0.15 and 0.17. The data are seen to be in perfect agreement with the theoretical curve, for both dopings. This shows that the theory of Gaussian fluctuations continues to be valid in PCCO well beyond the limit of small fields. We conclude that all aspects of our data in PCCO agree with the theory of Gaussian fluctuations.

Before moving on to the next section, let us comment on the behavior of H^{\star} close to T_{c}. At all dopings, we see that H^{\star} deviates from its \ln(T/T_{c}) dependence as T\to T_{c}, in such a way that H^{\star} saturates to a nonzero value at T=T_{c} or \epsilon=0 (Fig. 10). This is a reflection of the fact that the initial rise in N_{\rm sc} vs H never becomes infinitely rapid, even at \epsilon=0 (Fig. 8, right panels). As can be seen in Fig. 12, the initial slope v_{0} does not diverge as T\to T_{c}, for any doping. On the contrary, v_{0} saturates to a constant value below \epsilon\simeq 0.1. This saturation is entirely expected on theoretical grounds since v\sim\alpha_{xy}^{sc}/\sigma is the ratio of two coefficients that both diverge in the same way as \epsilon\to 0. Indeed, just as \alpha_{xy}^{sc}\propto 1/\epsilon [Eq. (6)], so is \sigma\propto 1/\epsilon[53].

### Comparison with hole-doped cuprates

We have shown that in the electron-doped cuprate PCCO the superconducting fluctuations are Gaussian throughout the doping phase diagram, ruling out phase fluctuations as a mechanism for the T_{c} dome, and superconductivity weakens as soon as Fermi-surface reconstruction sets in, below a critical doping x_{c}. The origin of the T_{c} dome is therefore an underlying growth in the gap \Delta_{0} with decreasing x, curtailed by the onset of a competing phase. This is why the dome is centered around x_{c}. In this section, we investigate to what extent a similar scenario applies to hole-doped cuprates.

#### iii.4.1 FSR and the origin of the T_{c} dome

The first thing to note is that hole-doped cuprates also undergo a FSR below some critical doping p_{c}[46, 47]. This was revealed unambiguously by the discovery of low-frequency quantum oscillations in YBCO [55], shown to come from a small electronlike pocket in the Fermi surface of underdoped YBCO, because of the large negative Hall coefficient R_{H} at low temperature [56]. In the normal state, once superconductivity has been removed by application of a large magnetic field, the electron pocket is seen to persist as a function of doping up to at least p=0.15[57]. Given that hole-doped cuprates above p\simeq 0.25 are known to have a single large holelike Fermi surface [58, 59, 37] (very similar to that of electron-doped cuprates at high x), the FSR in the normal state at T=0 must take place at a critical doping p_{c} such that 0.15<p_{c}<0.25.

In YBCO, the onset of this FSR upon cooling is rather gradual, as it is in PCCO, and it may be said to occur at the temperature T_{\rm max} below which R_{H}(T) starts to fall towards negative values [57]. The fact that the T_{\rm max} line and the T_{c} line cross where the latter peaks is strong evidence that the the drop of T_{c} on the underdoped side is linked to the FSR [57, 31].

The temperature-doping phase diagram of YBCO is therefore similar to that of PCCO (Fig. 2), in the sense that the onset of FSR extrapolates to a critical point at T=0 which lies just above optimal doping (where T_{c} peaks). So, the origin of the T_{c} dome in hole-doped cuprates appears to be fundamentally the same as in electron-doped cuprates, namely, phase competition and FSR below a quantum critical point located inside the dome. Note, however, that the competing order itself may be different.

#### iii.4.2 Critical field H_{c2} and critical doping p_{c}

To investigate the comparison further, we examine the doping dependence of critical fields in hole-doped cuprates. The upper critical field H_{c2} was recently determined by thermal conductivity measurements in YBCO, YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}, and Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6} (Tl-2201) [31]. The data revealed that H_{c2}=H_{\rm x3}(0), as confirmed here in PCCO at x=0.15. Using high-field measurements of H_{\rm vs}(T), the complete doping dependence of H_{c2} was reported; the data are reproduced in Fig. 17. We see that H_{c2} versus p exhibits two peaks, pointing to two underlying quantum critical points, possibly associated with the onset of two distinct competing phases [31]. Here, we focus on the higher peak, at p_{c}=0.18. Starting from high doping, we see that H_{c2} rises from zero at p\simeq 0.27 up to H_{c2}=150\pm 20 T at p_{c}. In this overdoped regime, the ratio H_{c2}/T_{c}^{2} is roughly constant (Fig. 14), showing that the growth in the gap magnitude \Delta_{0} controls the rise of T_{c} and H_{c2}, as we found in overdoped PCCO.

Moreover, the value of the ratio is roughly the same in both hole-doped and electron-doped materials, namely, H_{c2}/T_{c}^{2}\simeq 18 mT/K^{2} (Fig. 14). This may be somewhat coincidental since H_{c2} depends on the Fermi velocity v_{F} and the mean-free path

Figure 16: (Color online) Superconducting Nernst signal of PCCO in the absence of FSR, plotted as a function of magnetic field for the overdoped (x=0.17; red) and optimally doped (x=0.15; blue) samples, measured at T=1.08\ T_{c} in both cases. The data are compared to the theoretical calculation of \alpha_{xy}^{sc} (green curve, from Ref. [20]). For both experimental data and calculated curve, the x axis is normalized by the peak field H^{\star} and the y axis is normalized by the magnitude of the superconducting Nernst signal at H^{\star}. The agreement between theory and experiment is excellent.

  l (see Appendix A), and these parameters may not be identical in YBCO or Tl-2201 and in PCCO, but it nevertheless explains why H_{c2} in PCCO is so much smaller than in YBCO. Indeed, a factor 5 smaller T_{c}, from T_{c}\simeq 100 K to T_{c}\simeq 20 K, will yield a factor 25 smaller H_{c2}, from H_{c2}\simeq 150 T to H_{c2}\simeq 6 T, as roughly observed.

Below p_{c}=0.18, H_{c2} in YBCO drops by a factor 6, down to H_{c2}=24\pm 2 T at p=0.11[31]. The condensation energy \delta E drops by a factor 20, and the ratio \delta E/T_{c}^{2} by a factor 8 [31]. This dramatic suppression of superconductivity is attributed to phase competition, involving the onset of charge order [31, 63, 64]. The value of p_{c} is consistent with the onset of FSR at T=0, as estimated from R_{H}[57].

As seen in Fig. 14, the FSR in YBCO causes a _drop_ in the ratio H_{c2}/T_{c}^{2}, at least initially, whereas the FSR in PCCO causes an increase. The difference is likely to come at least in part from the different effect of FSR on the Fermi velocity v_{F}. We mentioned that in PCCO v_{F} undergoes a large change, by an order of magnitude. In YBCO, however, quantum oscillation measurements give only a factor 2 drop in v_{F} upon FSR, if we compare overdoped Tl-2201 (p\simeq 0.25; Ref. [65]) and underdoped YBCO (p=0.11; Ref. [66]). The difference could also come from a different topology of the reconstructed Fermi surface. While the electron pocket in the Fermi surface of PCCO is located at (\pi,0), where the d-wave gap is maximal, the electron pocket in the Fermi surface of YBCO is quite possibly located at (\pi/2,\pi/2), where the gap goes to zero [67].

#### iv.2.3 Superconducting fluctuations

Superconducting fluctuations in hole-doped cuprates have been studied extensively, mostly via measurements of the electrical resistivity, the magnetization, and the Nernst effect. An exhaustive study of paraconductivity in YBCO by Ando and co-workers showed that Gaussian theory (Aslamazov-Larkin) accounts well for the effect of superconducting fluctuations above T_{c}[60]. From their analysis, justified in light of other works [68, 69], they extract a coherence length \xi as a function of doping, and use it to estimate the critical field \tilde{H}_{c2}(0)=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi^{2}. A later study by Rullier-Albenque and co-workers, based on a similar analysis, yielded \tilde{H}_{c2}(0) values in good agreement with the earlier work, at least for p<0.15[61]. For p>0.15, the use of higher magnetic fields in the more recent study may have improved the estimate of the underlying normal-state magnetoresistance [70]. In Fig. 17, we plot H_{c2}\simeq 0.59\tilde{H}_{c2}(0) obtained from the data of both groups on the H-p diagram of YBCO. We also plot H_{c2} obtained from recent magnetization measurements analyzed using Gaussian theory to extract the coherence length [62]. The agreement between H_{c2} obtained from direct measurements of H_{\rm vs} at low temperature and high fields and H_{c2} encoded in the superconducting fluctuations above T_{c} is remarkable. In particular, it exhibits the same two-peak structure and the same sixfold drop between p=0.18 and 0.11.

The Nernst response of hole-doped cuprates was recently revisited and shown to be in excellent agreement with the Gaussian theory [21]. Figures 18 and 19 show how the behavior of N_{\rm sc} in the hole-doped cuprate Eu-LSCO is qualitatively identical to that of electron-doped PCCO, as a function of field and temperature, respectively.

We conclude that superconducting fluctuations in cuprates are well described by Gaussian theory, whether in electron-doped or hole-doped materials, whether in the overdoped or underdoped regimes. This may no longer be true at very low doping, i.e., p<0.08 and x<0.13, when close to the Mott insulator, but otherwise it appears that using the standard theory is a reliable way to extract fundamental information about superconductivity in the cuprates. Previous analyses of

Figure 17: (Color online) Upper critical field H_{c2} in the hole-doped cuprate YBCO, obtained in two different ways. First, directly from resistive measurements of H_{\rm vs}(T) at low temperature in high magnetic fields, extrapolated to T=0, giving H_{c2}=H_{\rm vs}(0) (blue symbols) [31]. The open circles are for YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} (p=0.14) and Tl-2201 (p>0.21) [31]. Second, we plot 0.59\tilde{H}_{c2}(0) (red symbols) with \tilde{H}_{c2}(0)=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi^{2}(0), where the coherence length \xi(0) is obtained from Gaussian Aslamazov-Larkin theory applied above T_{c} to either the conductivity (full squares from Ref. [60], open squares from Ref. [61]) or the magnetization (open diamonds, from Ref. [62]). The agreement between the two ways of determining H_{c2} is remarkable.

Figure 18: (Color online) Superconducting Nernst signal of electron-doped PCCO (blue) and hole-doped Eu-LSCO (red), measured at T=1.08T_{c} in both cases, for dopings as indicated. The x axis is normalized by the peak field H^{\star} and the y axis is normalized by the magnitude of the superconducting Nernst signal at H^{\star}. The agreement between the two is excellent, showing that the nature of superconducting fluctuations is basically the same whether cuprates are electron doped or hole doped, and both are well described by Gaussian theory (see Fig. 16).

  paraconductivity and diamagnetism in hole-doped cuprates such as YBCO have also found Gaussian theory to be a good description of the superconducting fluctuations [69, 71, 72].

## VI Summary

Our measurements of the Nernst effect in the electron-doped cuprate superconductor PCCO elucidate the nature of superconducting fluctuations above the critical temperature T_{c}. We find that the superconducting Nernst signal N_{\rm sc} is in qualitative and quantitative agreement with the theory of Gaussian fluctuations in dirty 2D superconductors [18, 19, 20] at all dopings. Indeed, N_{\rm sc}(T,H) in PCCO behaves as it does in the conventional superconductor \rm Nb_{S}Si_{1-x}[16, 17]. This implies that there is nothing unusual about the fluctuations in PCCO, even in the underdoped regime. There is no evidence of any vortexlike excitations, or preformed pairs, above T_{c}.

The characteristic magnetic field scale H_{c2}^{\star} extracted directly from the data independent of any theoretical assumptions displays a domelike dependence on doping, showing the same x dependence as T_{c}, both peaking at x=0.15. This shows that the pairing strength drops below optimal doping. This weakening of superconductivity occurs at the critical doping where the Fermi surface undergoes a reconstruction [22]. The scenario is therefore one of competition with another ordered phase that causes both the Fermi-surface reconstruction and the suppression of T_{c} and H_{c2}^{\star}[31, 46, 47, 73, 74]. Most likely, the competing phase in PCCO is antiferromagnetic order [23].

The emerging picture for PCCO is therefore the same as in quasi-1D organic superconductors, where an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point is clearly the organizing principle [47, 49]. The magnetic fluctuations cause d-wave pairing, while the magnetic order competes with superconductivity. The first effect increases T_{c}, the second decreases T_{c}, and the two together produce the T_{c} dome that straddles the critical point. By analogy, we infer that the same two mechanisms are at play in PCCO, supporting the case for magnetically mediated pairing in cuprates [29, 47]. This is also the likely scenario in iron-based superconductors [50].

A comparison of our Nernst data on PCCO with corresponding data reported for the hole-doped cuprate Eu-LSCO (Ref. [21]) reveals a strong similarity. We conclude that superconducting fluctuations in hole-doped cuprates are not significantly different. This validates the use of Gaussian fluctuation theory in previous analyses of paraconductivity data in underdoped YBCO, which yielded an estimate of H_{c2} that decreases rapidly with underdoping [60, 61], in good agreement with direct measurements of H_{c2} in YBCO [31]. These studies establish that the dominant mechanism for the T_{c} dome in hole-doped cuprates is also phase competition. Interestingly, in this case the competition does not seem to come from magnetic order, but appears to involve charge order [63, 64].

We conclude that fluctuations in the phase of the superconducting order parameter, long invoked as the mechanism responsible for the T_{c} dome of cuprates, do not in fact play a prominent role in the origin of the T_{c} dome of either electron-doped or hole-doped cuprates.

## Appendix A Estimate of H_{c2} in PCCO

Quantum oscillations in the c-axis resistivity of overdoped NCCO at x=0.17 have a frequency F=10\,960 T and a cyclotron mass m^{\star}=2.3m_{0}[44]. Using the Onsager relation

\[F=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi^{2}}A_{k}\] (10)

with \Phi_{0}=2.07\times 10^{-15} Wb, we extract the corresponding values for the Fermi wave vector of the large Fermi surface k_{\rm F}=0.58 A^{-1} and the Fermi velocity v_{\rm H}=\hbar k_{\rm F}/m^{\star}=2.9\times 10^{5} m/s. Using the following relation for the coherence length of a clean superconductor:

\[\xi_{0}^{\rm clean}=\frac{\hbar v_{F}}{a\Delta_{0}}\] (11)

with a=1.5 and \Delta_{0}=2.14k_{\rm B}T_{c} for a d-wave state, we extract the clean limit coherence length \xi_{0}^{\rm clean}=51 nm. Disorder affects the clean limit coherence length if the mean-free path \ell is comparable to \xi_{0}^{\rm clean}. We estimate the mean-free path via the relation

\[\ell=\frac{hs}{e^{2}\rho_{0}k_{F}},\] (12)

Figure 19: (Color online) Comparison of H^{\star} vs \epsilon for electron-doped PCCO (green circles) and hole-doped Eu-LSCO (red circles), at dopings as indicated. The PCCO data are multiplied by a factor 3. The black dotted line is a fit of the data to the function H^{\star}=H_{c2}^{\star}ln(T/T_{c}) [Eq. (4)].

  where \rho_{0} is the residual resistivity. Using the interlayer distance s=6.1 A and \rho_{0}=17.5\,\mu\Omega cm (Fig. 1), we get \ell=15.5 nm. Using Pippard's relation for the coherence length of dirty superconductors

\[\frac{1}{\xi_{0}^{\rm dirty}}=\frac{1}{\xi_{0}^{\rm clean}}+\frac{1}{\ell},\] (10)

we arrive at a coherence length of \xi_{0}^{\rm dirty}=11.9 nm in the dirty limit. We use this value to calculate the upper critical field from the expression:

\[H_{c2}=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi_{0}^{2}}=2.3\ \mathrm{T}.\] (11)

The result is close to our measured value H_{\rm vs}(T\to 0)=3.0\pm 0.2 T, as discussed in Sec. V.2 and presented in Table 1.

## Appendix B Magnitude of S\tan(\theta_{\rm H})

Equation (5) is valid when |S\tan\theta_{\rm H}|\ll N. To verify that this condition is indeed satisfied in our PCCO samples, we have measured the Seebeck effect in our thin films and used the values of R_{H} from Ref. [27] to calculate \tan(\theta_{H}) using \tan(\theta_{\rm H})=R_{\rm H}B/\rho. Table 3 lists the value of |S\tan\theta_{\rm H}|, N, and the ratio of the two quantities at T=4 K and H=15 T for our four samples. The condition |S\tan\theta_{\rm H}|\ll N is seen to hold at all dopings.
