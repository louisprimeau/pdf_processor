###### Abstract

We report a combined study of the Nernst coefficient (_n_), Hall effect,
and thermoelectric power of CaFe₂As₂ and CaFe_(1.92)Co_(0.08)As₂ single
crystals. The absolute value of n in both samples is enhanced, probably
due to ambipolar flow of electronlike and holelike quasiparticles. The
onset of spin-density-wave (SDW) order in CaFe₂As₂ causes further rapid
rise of the Nernst coefficient. On the contrary, in the
CaFe_(1.92)Co_(0.08)As₂ crystal we do not see any feature of _n_(_T_),
which could be clearly associated with SDW fluctuations. In this
Co-doped sample there is also no noticeable increase in of n in the
vicinity of superconducting transition despite the expectation of such
due to vortex movement.

The Nernst effect has become a subject of great interest since it turned
out to be a sensitive probe of exotic properties of the electronic
matter.[1, 2, 3] It has been found to be of great use also in studying
the normal[4, 5] and mixed states[1] of superconductors. The recently
discovered superconducting iron-pnictides seem to be no exception here.
For instance, data for the Nernst effect in LaO_(1 − x)F_(x)FeAs (Ref.
6) might suggest the presence of spin-density-wave (SDW) fluctuations
near the superconducting transition. In the present Rapid Communication
we investigate properties of two samples belonging to the "122" family
of the Fe-pnictides. Namely, we study transport phenomena, including the
Nernst effect, in two single crystals: the CaFe₂As₂ parent compound and
the cobalt-doped CaFe_(1.92)Co_(0.08)As₂ superconductor.

Single crystals of CaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂ were grown from Sn flux, using
atomic ratios Ca:Fe:As:Sn=1.1:2.2:1.40 for pure CaFe₂As₂ and
Ca:Fe:Co:As:Sn=1.1:1.85:0.2:2.40 for the Co-substituted compound. The
components were loaded into alumina crucibles and placed in quartz
ampoules which were evacuated and backfilled with Ar gas under pressure
of 0.3 bar and sealed. The ampoules were heated to 600 degC over 4 h,
held there for 1 h, then heated in 5 h to 1050 degC, and kept at that
temperature for 5 h so that all the components dissolved in the Sn flux.
The ampoules were then cooled slowly at 2 K/h down to 600 degC followed
by furnace cooling to room temperature. The flux was removed by etching
in diluted hydrochloric acid. Platelike single crystals of typical
dimensions 5 x 4 x 0.2 mm³ with the _c_-axis perpendicular to the plate
were obtained. However, those chosen for further investigation were
smaller of size  2 x 1.5 x 0.1 mm³. Phase purity was checked by powder
x-ray diffraction (XRD). All the observed diffraction lines on the XRD
pattern could be indexed according to the 1_4/mmm_ space group. The
lattice parameters obtained for CaFe₂As₂:_a_ = 3.883(1) A and c =
11.725(5) A agree well with the values reported by Ronning _et al._[7]
The lattice parameters a = 3.886(1) A and c = 11.695(5) A obtained for
CaFe_(1.92)Co_(0.08)As₂ are close to those reported for
CaFe_(1.94)Co_(0.06)As₂.[8] A chemical composition of the Co-doped
single crystal was determined by the energy dispersive x-ray (EDX)
analysis.

The resistivity (_r_) was measured by the four-probe technique, with 25
μm gold wires attached to the crystal using two-component silver epoxy.
For the Hall-coefficient (_R_H) measurement, a sample was mounted on a
rotatable probe and continuously turned by 180^(∘) (face down and up) in
a magnetic field (_B_) of 13 T to effectively reverse the field
antisymmetrical signal. During the thermoelectric power (_S_) and Nernst
coefficient (_n_) measurements crystals were clamped between two
phosphor bronze blocks where two Cernx thermometers and resistive
heaters were attached. These heaters were cyclically switched on and
off, and the temperature runs were repeated at various values of the
magnetic field (from -13 to +13 T) in order to extract the voltage
components that were odd and even in B.

The temperature dependences of the resistivity for the FeSe₂As₂ and
CaFe_(1.92)Co_(0.09)As₂ single crystals are shown in Fig. 1. Our results
remain in good agreement with data presented by Kumar _et al._,[8] but
it has to be mentioned that the reported value of the room-temperature
resistivity for CaFe₂As₂ single crystals varies among different studies.
For example, r (300 K) was shown to be equal to 2.2,7,2,8[8],3.1,9[9]
3.7 (this Rapid Communication), and 5.6 μm m.[10] It is not yet clear
what causes these differences. The pure CaFe₂As₂ single crystal
undergoes the first-order structural/magnetic transition at
_T_${}_{\rm e}$=170 K.[11] A clear hysteresis in the resistivity (D_T_∼
3 K) that is shown in the lower inset in Fig. 1 (data were collected at
the heating/cooling rate of 0.1 K/min) can be seen. The magnetic field
of 13 T, which in our setup was perpendicular to the crystallographic c
axis, has no noticeable impact on the shape and position of the anomaly,
whereas steps in region of the transition should probably be attributed
to movements of the domain walls that have been recently detected in
this material.[12] We are not certain at the moment what is an origin of
the dip at _T_=1742. K (marked with asterisk), which appears only when
the temperature is rising. There is no sign of a structural or a SDW
transition in the _r_(_T_) dependency for CaFe_(1.92)Co_(0.09)As₂. The
sharp superconducting transition (D_T__(10.90)

The temperature dependences of the Hall coefficients for the CaFe₂As₂
and CaFe_(1.92)Co_(0.08)As₂ crystals are presented in the upper panel of
Fig. 2(a). Both $R_{\rm H}(T)$ values are negative, except for a region
of 40 K below $T_{\rm tr}$, where $R_{\rm H}$ in the unsubstituted
crystal becomes positive. This may be related to the reconstruction of
the Fermi surface [13] resulting from the structural/magnetic
transition. On the other hand, CaFe₂As₂ is a conductor with the
multicomponent Fermi surface with charge carriers of the opposite signs.
[14] Therefore, a change in the $R_{\rm H}$ sign can result from a
drastic modification of the hole/electron mean-free paths, as suggested
at the transition. [15] The importance of this mechanism seems to be
supported by data on the Hall coefficient in CaFe₂As₂ reported by
Ronning _et al._ in Ref. [7]. They noticed a very similar hump in
$R_{\rm H}(T)$ below $T_{\rm tr}$, but no change in sign was observed.
The total Hall coefficient of a multiband conductor is a sum of the Hall
coefficients of individual bands (denoted by "+" and "-" indexes),
weighted by square of their electrical conductivities (σ),

$$R_{\rm H}=\frac{R_{\rm H_{\rm tr}}(\sigma_{\rm r})^{2}+R_{\rm H_{\rm tr}}( \sigma_{\rm r})^{2}}{(\sigma_{\rm r}+\sigma_{\rm r})^{2}}.$$
(1)

Therefore, in two single crystals with different number of scattering
impurities, which can affect $\sigma_{\rm r}$ and $\sigma_{\rm r}$, in
different ways, $R_{\rm H}$ may have different sign in a certain range
of T. An analogous variation in the Hall coefficient can be observed in
the Co-doped crystal for temperatures above $T_{\rm tr}$. In this region
$R_{\rm H}(T)$ is shifted vertically to more negative values as compared
to the pure sample [see the inset in Fig. 2(a)]. A ratio of $R_{\rm H}$
for CaFe_(1.92)Co_(0.08)As₂ to $R_{\rm H}$ for CaFe₂As₂ is at room
temperature ≈1.5; thus, a rise in the number of the electronlike charge
carriers would have to be significant to induce such a big effect. On
the contrary, the resistivity data do not show reduction but growth of
the high-temperature resistivity in the Co-doped crystal. This suggests
that the observed variation in the Hall coefficient may result rather
from a decrease in the holes mean-free path.

This scenario seems to be proven by the high-temperature data on the
thermoelectric power shown in Fig. 2(b). This quantity can also be
expressed as a sum of contributions from holelike and electronlike
carriers but with different conductivity weighting factors,

$$S=\frac{S_{\rm r}\sigma_{\rm r}+S_{\rm r}\sigma_{\rm r}}{\sigma_{\rm r}+ \sigma_{\rm r}}.$$
(2)

In the CaFe_(1.92)Co_(0.08)As₂ crystal S(T) above $T_{\rm tr}$ is
vertically shifted from positive to negative values. Because this shift
is almost parallel, we conclude that it arises from T-independent change
in the electrical conductivities, and it is likely to be caused by the
additional scattering of the holelike charge carriers caused by cobalt
ions. Below $T_{\rm tr}$ the thermopower in pure CaFe₂As₂ develops a
high and broad maximum that is one of the characteristics of
spin-density-wave

order,[16] and it was already observed in this material.[10]

As shown in Fig. 3 the temperature dependence of the Nernst coefficient
in pure CaFe₂As₂ also shows a large anomaly below $T_{\rm{tr}}$. This
rapid growth of the absolute value of ν has likely the same origin as
the maximum in S(T); i.e., it can be caused by the transition of the
electronic system to the SDW state. It has been recently shown by Hackl
and Sachdev that a reconstruction of the Fermi surface due to
spin-density-wave order has fundamental implications for the Nernst
signal and the thermopower.[17] The authors related this dramatic change
in the thermoelectric response to the singularity in the quasiparticle
density of states. A different approach utilized by Oganesyan and
Ussishkin also indicates a possible significant enhancement of the
Nernst signal in the case of formation of Fermi pockets associated with
spin-density waves.[18] In general, the large contribution to the
thermoelectric power, which is seen below SDW transition, can be
interpreted as a consequence of variation in the chemical potential[19]
that is immediately connected with the Nernst coefficient.[20] Namely, ν
is related to the Fermi temperature ($T_{\rm{F}}$) and Hall mobility
($\mu_{\rm{H}}$) by the equation

$$\nu=\frac{\pi^{2}k_{\rm{B}}}{3e}\frac{T\mu_{\rm{H}}}{T_{\rm{F}}},$$
(3)

where $k_{\rm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and e is the elementary
charge. The low-temperature limits of $\mu_{\rm{H}}$≈ 0.02 T⁻¹ and ν/T=
2.5×10⁻⁸ V K⁻² T⁻¹ yields the very small Fermi temperature in
CaFe₂As₂:$T_{\rm{F}}$= 230 K. This value is close to those deduced from
the Hall-effect analysis for the Sr-122 and Ba-122 parent compounds,[9]
but it should be treated only as an approximation since CaFe₂As₂ is a
multiband system and the Fermi energy and mobility can vary among the
bands.

The normal-state Nernst coefficient is composed of two terms,[21]

$$\nu=\left(\frac{\alpha_{xy}}{\sigma}-S\ \tan\ \theta\right)\frac{1}{B},$$
(4)

where α_(xy) is the off-diagonal element of the Peltier tensor and θ is
the Hall angle. For a momentum and energy-independent relaxation time,
two terms in Eq. (4) cancel exactly.[22] This "Sondheimer cancellation"
is no longer valid when there are separate electron and hole
conductivity bands,[23] and this effectively leads to substantial
enhancement of the measured Nernst signal. As shown in Fig. 3 the (S tan
θ) component for CaFe₂As₂ and CaFe_(1.92)Co_(0.08)As₂ is much smaller
than ν (thus $\frac{\alpha_{xy}}{\sigma}$≫Stan  θ) in the whole
temperature range of study. It indicates that the Sondheimer
cancellation is violated and suggests that simultaneous flow of
electronlike and holelike carriers occurs both inside and outside the
SDW phase.

The ν(T) dependence in the normal state of CaFe_(1.92)Co_(0.08)As₂ does
not show any particular feature, which could be attributed to the
influence of the SDW fluctuations. The Nernst coefficient evolves
smoothly, and a shape of the ν(T) curve resembles closely S(T). The main
difference is the temperature at which a broad minimum occurs. T≈ 65 K
for the Nernst coefficient, and T≈ 105 K for the thermopower. In the
vicinity of the superconducting transition in CaFe_(1.92)Co_(0.08)As₂,
we do not see any Nernst effect contribution from vortex movement
(ν_(y)). A similar phenomenon was already observed in classical
superconductors,[24] where the "vortex liquid" state is extremely
narrow, and also in CeCoIn_(5.)[3]. However, in this latter case it was
possible to extract the flux-flow signal with the aid of the thermopower
data, and ν_(y) was estimated to be ∼0.1 μV K⁻¹ T⁻¹. In our experiment
the large value of the Nernst coefficient in the normal state can also
make it difficult to extract a vortex contribution, but we estimate that
the value of ν_(y) would have to be smaller than ∼0.01 μV K⁻¹ T⁻¹ and/or
be present in a very narrow temperature range (∼1 K) to remain
undetected. Furthermore, the field dependences of the Nernst signal for
several temperatures close to $T_{\rm{c}}$, which are shown in the inset
in Fig. 3, do not show any detectable positive contribution from vortex
motion. The nonlinear contribution seen for 16≤T≈ 20.5 K appears to be
simple consequence of the superconducting state being destroyed by the
increasing magnetic field. It could be mistaken as a component from flux
flow if the experiment were carried out only for positive magnetic
field. However, data taken for B< 0 reveal a gradual reappearance of the
normal-state behavior.

We think that the lack of a detectable contribution to the Nernst signal
from flux flow can be a result of strong vortex pinning in the mixed
state of CaFe_(1.92)Co_(0.08)As₂, which prevents vortices from flowing
under the influence of the thermal gradient. This conclusion agrees with
results of high-field magnetotransport and magnetization studies on a
single crystal of the Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(y))₂As₂ that indicate weak
thermal fluctuations and/or strong vortex pinning in this material.[25]
Results of magnetization measurements performed for the
CaFe_(1.92)Co_(0.08)As₂ single crystal show that the irreversibility
field is very close to the upper critical field, and these data will be
presented in a separate report.

In summary, we measured the transport coefficients of the

parent compound CaFe₂As₂ as well as the superconducting
CaFe_(1.92)Co_(0.08)As₂ single crystals. We found that the Nernst
coefficient in both samples is enhanced due to ambipolar flow of
quasiparticles. Additionally, the absolute value of ν grows rapidly and
almost linearly with T in the SDW state of CaFe₂As₂. The low-temperature
values of ν, $R_{\rm H}$, and ρ in this parent compound allow us to
estimate the Fermi energy to be of the order of 20 meV. We did not see
any clear evidence of SDW fluctuations in any measured quantity for
CaFe_(1.92)Co_(0.08)As₂. In this superconducting material we also did
not see any Nernst signal from vortex motion in the vicinity of
$T_{\rm c}$. It could mean that a vortex pinning in the Co-doped sample
is very high and suppresses formation of the "vortex liquid" state.
