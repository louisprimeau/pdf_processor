###### Abstract

The thermal expansion coefficient \(a\) of MgB\({}_{2}\) is revealed to change from positive to negative on cooling through the superconducting transition temperature _Tc_. The Gruneisen function also becomes negative at _Tc_ followed by a dramatic increase to large positive values at low temperature. The results suggest anomalous coupling between superconducting electrons and low-energy phonons.

Superconductivity in the binary compound MgB\({}_{2}\) near 39 K is a fascinating development. Over the last few years, scientists have argued that a lattice instability [1] and/or anomalous phonon behavior [2] might be responsible for the high transition temperature. Specific attention has focused on the _E\({}_{2g}\)_ phonon, a bond-stretching phonon within the plane of the hexagonal crystal structure. [2, 3, 4] In-plane tensile strain, induced by lattice mismatch through thin-film growth, increases the superconducting transition temperature _Tc_ to 41.8 K; this enhancement was attributed to a decrease in the _E\({}_{2g}\)_ phonon frequency. [5] Phonons can be studied with techniques such as Raman spectroscopy [3, 4] and heat capacity. [6, 7, 8] Often neglected in the study of phonons is thermal expansion, partly because of the exceptional resolution needed to resolve the transition at _Tc_.

Thermal expansion from powder diffraction measurements [9, 10] of MgB\({}_{2}\) have revealed an anomalous volume expansion on cooling below _Tc_. However, _high-resolution_ thermal expansion measurements (dilatometry) with a relative sensitivity approximately four orders of magnitude better than powder diffraction are required for meaningful thermodynamic analysis. Such measurements of polycrystalline MgB\({}_{2}\) were reported, [11] but discrepancies with the diffraction data, such as the temperature at which the thermal expansion coefficient \(a\) changes from positive to negative, are apparent.

In this Rapid Communication, high-resolution thermal expansion measurements of polycrystalline MgB\({}_{2}\) are presented. The results reveal a change in sign of \(a\) at _Tc_, with negative thermal expansion below _Tc_; these data agree with diffraction investigations, [9, 10] but offer _exceedingly_ greater detail. Analysis of the bulk Gruneisen function reveals anomalous behavior due to dominant low-energy phonon modes. The change in sign of \(a\) at _precisely_ _Tc_ suggests a connection between these phonon modes and superconductivity.

MgB\({}_{2}\), synthesized with \({}^{11}\)B as described previously, [12] was pelletized (diameter=4.6 mm), placed in a boron nitride crucible and heated to 800 degC for 30 min at 3 GPa using a cubic multianvil press. A very thin black layer, impurities from surface reaction with boron nitride, was removed, leaving behind a brilliant gold-colored MgB\({}_{2}\) sample with density 2.56 g/cm\({}^{3}\) (100% of theoretical density). Heat capacity was measured with a thermal-relaxation technique. _Tc_ versus pressure was determined inductively (0.12 Oe rms field at 1023 Hz) to 0.63 GPa using a helium pressure medium; a manganin sensor at room temperature served as a manometer. [13]

Thermal expansion was measured with a capacitive dilatometer cell (Fig. 1) constructed from fused quartz, [14] which has among the smallest known thermal expansions. [15] Calibration is realized by measuring copper [16] at 300 K and 79.3 K, where the length change of fused quartz, \(\Delta L/L_{300K}\), is zero. [15] During measurements, the sample and cell (in thermal equilibrium) are warmed at 0.2 K/min as capacitance and temperature are recorded at intervals ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 K. The data are corrected for temperature-dependent changes in capacitance of the empty cell, measured in a separate experiment, and the differential expansion

 between the cell and sample using data for quartz.[15] These contributions amount to 2.7% and 4.1%, respectively, of the capacitance change due to the thermal expansion of MgB\({}_{2}\) over the temperature range 6 K \(<\) \(T\)\(<\) 300 K; the latter correction would be 63 times larger if a conventional copper dilatometer cell were used to measure MgB\({}_{2}\), because of copper's large thermal expansion.[16] The specimen was measured along two perpendicular axes (4238 \(\mu\)m and 3665 \(\mu\)m long) to search for preferred crystallographic orientation effects (none were detected).

Linear thermal expansion \(\Delta L/L_{6K}\) is shown in Fig. 2. These raw data have been corrected for the thermal expansion of quartz as described above with no other processing. The length decreases with temperature, as occurs in most materials, but it expands on cooling below \(T_{c}\)=38.7 K as illustrated in the inset where the 20 A scale reveals the _absolute_ length change of the 4238 \(\mu\)m long specimen. The distinct change in \(\Delta L/L_{6K}\) near \(T_{c}\) is highlighted further in the inset of Fig. 3 where _angstrom-scale_ resolution and the continuous (second-order) nature of the phase transition are evident. The measurement was repeated three times along the 3665 \(\mu\)m length and three times along the 4238 \(\mu\)m length with similar results to those shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The overall linear expansion (\(L_{300K}\)\(-\)\(L_{6K}\))/\(L_{6K}\)=119.2(4) \(\times\) 10\({}^{-5}\).

The thermal expansion coefficient \(\alpha\)=(1/\(L_{6K}\))\(\partial\Delta L/\partial T\) is obtained by fitting the data in Fig. 2 using Chebyshev polynomials and differentiating; overlap between neighboring fit regions assures a smooth derivative and caution is exercised near the sharp feature at \(T_{c}\). This method is typical for taking derivatives when tiny changes between neighboring data points occurs.[17] The resulting \(\alpha\) values are plotted between 0 and 50 K in Fig. 3; all six measurements showed similar behavior. Note that \(\alpha\)(50 K) is 16.7 times smaller than that of copper,[16] a consequence of the large Debye temperature[7] of MgB\({}_{2}\). Negative thermal expansion sets in at precisely \(T_{c}\) and further inspection reveals a crossover at 18.7 K to \(\alpha\)\(>\) 0. Furthermore, a broad peak is evident in \(\alpha\) at 9.7 K, below which it decreases. According to the third law of thermodynamics, \(\alpha\) should approach zero at \(T\)=0; this behavior is illustrated by the (hypothetical) dashed line in Fig. 3.

The jump in \(\alpha\) at \(T_{c}\) (solid lines Fig. 3), \(\Delta\alpha\)= \(\alpha_{N}\)\(-\)\(\alpha_{S}\) = 6.3(7)\(\times\) 10\({}^{-8}\) K\({}^{-1}\), was obtained after averaging the jumps observed in six measurements; \(N\) represents the normal state and \(S\) the superconducting state. This value agrees with \(\Delta\alpha\) =5.8\(\times\) 10\({}^{-8}\) K\({}^{-1}\) reported previously;[11] in that paper, \(\alpha\)\(<\) 0 below 10 K, but remained above zero for \(T\)\(>\) 10 K. These differences may be associated with (1) the high density of our specimen, since polycrystalline MgB\({}_{2}\) prepared by the method in Ref. [11] it is highly porous with low cohexisiveness and elastic modulus,[18] (2) the higher \(T_{c}\) (38.7 K vs 37.8 K), or (3) the copper thermal expansion cell used in Ref. [11] which requires a significantly larger correction to the data than our cell (see above). Behavior in \(\Delta L/L_{6K}\) similar to that of Fig. 2 was revealed in diffraction measurements,[9, 10] but the present data offer far more resolution.

Heat capacity at constant pressure \(C_{P}\) was measured on the same sample. A background of the form \(C_{P}\)=\(A_{1}T\) + \(A_{3}T^{3}\)+\(A_{5}T^{5}\) (\(A_{1}\), \(A_{3}\), and \(A_{5}\) are constants) is subtracted, which was obtained by fitting \(C_{P}\)(9 tesla) in the range 25 K \(<\)\(T\)\(<\) 50 K; the form of this background is identical to that used previously.[7] A clear feature is observed at \(T_{c}\) =38.7 K (lower inset of Fig. 4). The solid lines denote the steplike behavior expected for a continuous (second-order) phase transition. Using an entropy-conserving construction, the jump \(\Delta C_{P}\)=\(-\)121(1) mJ/mole K is estimated.

The Ehrenfest relation,

\[\frac{dT_{c}}{dP}=3vT_{c}\frac{\Delta\alpha}{\Delta C_{P}},\] (1)

provides the connection between the pressure derivative of \(T_{c}\), \(\Delta\alpha\), and \(\Delta C_{P}\) (\(v\) is the molar volume). It has yielded

Figure 3: Inset shows \(\Delta L/L_{6K}\) near \(T_{c}\) illustrating the change in slope, excellent resolution of the data, and continuous nature of the phase transition. The solid line in the inset is the fit that, after differentiation, yields the thermal expansion coefficient \(\alpha\) (main panel). Solid lines indicate the jump in \(\alpha\) at \(T_{c}\). The dashed line below 6 K denotes hypothetical behavior.

  \(dT_{c}/dP\) in agreement with experiment for other superconductors.[19, 20] Using \(\Delta\alpha\)=\(6.3(7)\times 10^{-8}\) K\({}^{-1}\), \(\Delta C_{P}\)=\(-121(1)\) mJ/mole K, and \(v\)=\(1.74\times 10^{-5}\) m\({}^{3}\)/mole,[9]\(dT_{c}/dP\)=\(-1.05(13)\) K/GPa is obtained. Variation in \(\Delta C_{P}\) values[8] (66 mJ/mole K to 133 mJ/mole K) underscores the importance of measure \(\Delta C_{P}\) and \(\Delta\alpha\) on the same sample to reliably estimate \(dT_{c}/dP\).

To test the calculation via Eq. (1), \(dT_{c}/dP\) was measured on our sample using a _purely hydrostatic method_. Pressure was changed below 55 K and only one transition (\(P\)=\(0.63\) GPa) was measured in solid helium. \(T_{c}(P)\) was determined from the midpoint of the superconducting transition in the real part of the ac magnetic susceptibility. The data (Fig. 5) show that \(T_{c}\) decreases at \(dT_{c}/dP\)=\(-1.07(0.03)\) K/GPa, similar to prior reports.[13] This value is in excellent agreement with the value predicted by the Ehrenfest relation. This observation together with the continuous behavior of \(\Delta L/L_{6K}\) eliminates the possibility of a significant lattice instability in MgB\({}_{2}\) for 6 K \(<\)\(T\)\(<\) 300 K.

While negative thermal expansivities are not that unusual,[21] the crossover of \(\alpha\) from positive to negative, at precisely \(T_{c}\), is rare. Tantalum exhibits a slight negative[22]\(\alpha\) below \(T_{c}\)=\(4.4\) K; what distinguishes this feature in MgB\({}_{2}\) is that \(\alpha\) is eight times larger above \(T_{c}\), and that it becomes strongly negative below \(T_{c}\). Thus, the electronic transition into the superconducting state has a significant impact on the thermal expansion at and below \(T_{c}\) as revealed in Figs. 2 and 3.

Thermal expansion is a sensitive probe of phonon behavior which is analyzed through the bulk Gruneisen function \(\gamma_{G}\)=\(\beta\)_BV/C\({}_{V}\)_ calculated using data[18] for the bulk modulus \(B\) and our measurements of the volume thermal expansion coefficient \(\beta\)=\(3\alpha\), \(V\), and \(C_{P}\) [the heat capacity at constant volume \(C_{V}\)=\(C_{P}\) (Ref. [23]]). It is a dimensionless weighted sum[21] of \(\gamma_{i}\) values (i.e., \(\gamma_{G}\)=\(\sum_{i}c_{i}\gamma_{i}/\sum_{i}c_{i}\) where \(c_{i}\)=\(e^{-\Delta\alpha/k_{B}T}\); \(h\) is the Planck constant divided by \(2\pi\) and \(k_{B}\) is the Boltzmann constant) each associated with a phonon mode of vibrational frequency \(\omega_{i}\) and \(\gamma_{i}\)=\(-d\ln\omega_{i}/d\ln V\). \(\gamma_{G}\) has a value of 1.30 near 300 K, rises slightly to 1.35 at 90 K followed by a gradual decrease. This decrease continues (see Fig. 4), until \(\gamma_{G}\) crosses zero at \(T_{c}\), reaches a minimum of \(-1.65\) at 24.5 K, before increasing to 34.2 at 5.8 K. Nonmonotonic behavior of the Gruneisen function is a consequence of strong anharmonic lattice vibrations,[24] which have been observed[3, 4] in MgB\({}_{2}\). The negative as well as the large positive values of \(\gamma_{G}\) must be associated with anomalous phonon modes that dominate the weighted sum due to their respective thermal populations; electron-phonon interactions will also play a role.

In other layered materials, negative \(\alpha\) values are generally associated with transverse acoustic vibrations, which propagate in the layers,[24] leading to negative \(a\)-axis \(\gamma_{i}\) values. As a result, the change in sign of \(\alpha\) and \(\gamma_{G}\) at \(T_{c}\), coincident with hardening of the \(E_{2g}\) phonon,[4] is likely connected to planar electron-phonon interactions associated with the \(\sigma\)-band (in-plane) superconducting gap.[25, 26, 27]

At low temperature, differences in the intralayer bonding (along the \(c\) axis) may lead to low-energy phonon excitations and large \(c\)-axis \(\gamma_{i}\) values with high relative thermal population that cause the upturn of \(\gamma_{G}\) below 20 K; such behavior occurs in other layered materials, albeit with significantly smaller values[24] of \(\gamma_{G}\). In MgB\({}_{2}\), the spectacular increase of \(\gamma_{G}\) coincides with a reduced \(C_{P}\) below =\(11\) K, attributed to a second superconducting gap.[6, 7] Thus, \(C_{P}\) is diminished because of electronic effects due to the second gap, \(\alpha\) remains large, and their ratio leads to anomalously large \(\gamma_{G}\) values. These combined considerations suggest that the increase in \(\gamma_{G}\) at low temperature may result from out-of-plane electron-phonon interactions, associated with the weaker \(\pi\)-band superconducting gap,[25, 26, 27] which have a strong impact on the \(c\)-axis \(\gamma_{i}\) values.

The results presented here compliment spectroscopic phonon probes, some of which may be surface sensitive, by illustrating unusual phonon behavior in two fundamental _bulk_ thermodynamic quantities, the Gruneisen function and the

  thermal expansion coefficient. Thermal excitations of electrons across the two superconducting gaps, and their coupling to low-energy lattice vibrations, play a role in the anomalous behavior of \(\gamma_{G}\) and \(\alpha\).
