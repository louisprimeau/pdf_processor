###### Abstract

The ternary intermetallic compounds _MAB_ = CaAlSi, SrAlSi, BaAlSi, CaGaSi, SrGaSi, BaGaSi, SrAlGe, BaAlGe, CaGaGe, SrGaGe, BaGaGe, BaAlSn, CaGaSn, SrGaSn, and BaGaSn have been prepared by arc-melting stoichiometric elemental mixtures and structurally characterized by a combination of x-ray powder and electron diffraction. They crystallize as variants of the simple hexagonal AlB\({}_{2}\) structure type where trivalent and tetravalent _A_- and _B_-type atoms, respectively, form commonly a planar hexagon layer, and structural variations arise from _A_/_B_ ordering and/or puckering of hexagon layers. The silicides (_B_ = Si) were previously investigated for their superconducting properties. By dc magnetization measurements it is demonstrated that also the germanides SrAlGe, BaAlGe, SrGaGe, and BaGaGe and the stannide BaAlSn are superconductors above 2 K.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity at 39 K in MgB\({}_{2}\) (Ref. [1]) has drawn attention to isostructural intermetallic compounds with the simple AlB\({}_{2}\) structure.[2, 3, 4] In this respect the ternary silicides _M_AlSi and _M_GaSi (_M_ = Ca, Sr, Ba) have been extensively investigated and superconductivity above 2 K has been found for all systems, with the exception of BaAlSi.[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] In the ternary systems Si and Al/Ga commonly take the position of the boron atoms forming hexagon layers while \(M\) atoms occupy the "intercalating" positions. Generally, superconducting critical temperatures, \(T_{c}\), for the ternary silicides are considerably lower than for MgB\({}_{2}\). The highest \(T_{c}\) is 7.8 K and found for CaAlSi.[11]

Although both types of systems, MgB\({}_{2}\) and _M_AlSi (_A_ = Al, Ga) are considered as conventional superconductors, their mechanism of electron-phonon coupling is quite different. While the key ingredient to the superconducting properties of MgB\({}_{2}\) are partially occupied B-B \(s\) bonding states that couple strongly to in-plane vibrations of boron,[12] this situation is radically changed for _M_AlSi due to the increased electron count (nine valence electrons) and the higher mass of constituting atoms. For _M_AlSi, theoretical investigations identified partially occupied \(\pi^{*}\) and _M_-_d_ states in conjunction with a soft mode that is associated with the out-of-plane _A_-Si vibration as the origin for the superconducting properties.[13, 14, 15, 16, 17] Recent inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering experiments showed the existence of this soft mode for CaAlSi and confirmed its large anharmonicity and strong electron-phonon coupling.[18, 19]

The nine-electron systems _M_AlSi can be considered as charge imbalanced (not electron precise) Zintl phases. The electronic structure of a planar hexagon layer formed by main group atoms is characterized by three bonding \(s\) bands. Additionally, the \(p_{z}\) orbitals give rise to two \(p\) bands, one bonding and one antibonding. The Zintl concept assumes a formal charge transfer from the electropositive component \(M\) to the atoms forming the hexagon layer, and for main group AlB\({}_{2}\) systems an electron precise situation with all bonding bands filled is attained in eight-electron systems (e.g., SrGa\({}_{2}\) and BaGa\({}_{2}\)). Puckering of the hexagon layers destroys the \(\pi\) bands and creates more localized (lone pair) electronic states. Arsenic-like layers are electron precise for ten-electron systems and, for instance, realized in the structures of CaSi\({}_{2}\) and CaGe\({}_{2}\).[20]

The partial filling of the antibonding \(\pi^{*}\) band in nine-electron AB\({}_{2}\) systems _M_AlSi is thought to be responsible for the soft mode, which expresses an inherent structural instability toward layer puckering.[16, 18] Indeed, for CaAlSi polymorphs exhibiting slightly corrugated hexagon layers were identified, and their modulated structures are termed 5H and 6H in the literature (and 1H is used for the planar-layer AlB\({}_{2}\) form).[21] Such structural variations, which have a marked influence on the superconducting properties of CaAlSi,[22, 23, 24] have not been reported for SrAlSi, BaAlSi, and _M_GaSi. An additional issue is the degree of ordering of the two different kinds of elements within the hexagon layers. For _M_AlSi the discrimination between Al and Si is difficult to extract from diffraction experiments. Again CaAlSi has been most investigated and ordered and disordered variants have been reported for all polymorphs.[22, 25] It appears, however, that ordering within hexagon layers is of minor significance to superconducting properties.

Ternary nine-electron systems are not restricted to silicides but extend to germanides and stannides. Known are the germanides SrAlGe, BaAlGe, CaGaGe, SrGaGe, and BaGaGe and the stannides CaGaSn and SrGaSn.[26, 27, 28] While the aluminum compounds adopt the planar-layer AlB\({}_{2}\) structure, the gallium germanides and stannides are all reported with the YPtAs structure consisting of ordered and pronouncedly puckered hexagon layers. It is surprising that hitherto only silicides have been investigated for superconducting properties. Considering also germanides and stannides as potential superconductors, the nine-electron systems _MAB_  (_A_ = Al, Ga, In; \(B\) = Si, Ge, Sn) provide a unique compositional playground--enriched with structural variations--for fundamental studies of electron-phonon coupling phenomena in this class of conventional superconductors. Here we report a comparative study of the structural properties and superconductor behavior (above 2 K) of all possible elemental _MAB_ combinations crystallizing as variants of the AlB2 structure.

## II. Methods

All steps of synthesis and sample preparation for diffraction and electron microscopy experiments were carried out under dry argon. Ca (99.98%), Sr (99.95%), Ba (99.9%), Ga (99.999%), and Ge (99.999%) from Aldrich, and Al (99.99%), In (99.9%), Si (99.999%), and Sn (99.999%) from Alfa Aesar were used as received. The ternary nine-electron compounds _MAB_ were prepared by arc-melting stoichiometric mixtures of the pure elements on a water-cooled copper hearth and remelted three times to ensure homogeneity. Due to the volatility of \(M\) a low current arc was employed. Samples obtained from arc-melting were ground and their phase purity established by powder x-ray diffraction patterns taken on a Siemens D5000 diffractometer (Bragg-Brentano geometry; Cu K_a_ radiation).

Lattice parameters and atomic positions of the ternary phases _MAB_ were determined by Rietveld analysis [29] of high-resolution powder x-ray diffraction data using the topas program. [30] Finely ground samples were measured in 0.1 mm capillaries, and the high-resolution powder x-ray diffraction patterns were taken on a Bruker D8 diffractometer fitted with an incident-beam Ge monochromator (transmission geometry; Cu K_a_ irradiation). For Rietveld analysis, the following parameters were refined: background, unit cell, sample displacement, profile, atomic positions, isotropic atomic displacement parameters, and absorption correction. [31] For some samples, anisotropic peak broadening was modeled using spherical harmonics. [32] Results are compiled in Tables 1 and 2. Due to the large amount of impurities in CaGaSn, Rietveld analysis was not performed on that sample.

Samples for electron microscopy investigations were ground in a mortar and the resulting fine crystallites were supported onto holey-carbon coated copper grids. Transfer of the sample into the sample holder and into the electron microscope was done under normal air conditions. The subsequent transmission electron microscopy studies were carried out in a JEOL JEM-2100 F transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV and equipped with EDAX detector for compositional analysis. Due to the rapid decomposition of SrAlGe, BaAlGe, BaAlSn, and CaGaSn when exposed to air, investigation of those compounds were not possible.

Temperature-dependent magnetizations of _MAB_ samples (with the exception of impure CaGaSn) were measured by the vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) on a Quantum Design PPMS system. Powdered specimens were placed into a brass trough sample holder and sealed with a small amount of fast-curing superglue under dry argon. Subsequently the sample holder was loaded vertically into the PPMS chamber. Transition temperatures \(T_{c}\) were determined with magnetization measurements from 15 to 2 K at a rate of 1 K/min. The magnetic field was calibrated with Gd2(SO4)3 * 8H2O, a paramagnetic standard with a susceptibility of 0.0533 cm3/mol at room temperature. [33] Zero field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) measurements under a magnetic field of around 10 Oe were conducted for samples showing saturated magnetization above 2 K. Magnetization curves (_M_ vs _H_) were taken for SrAlGe and BaAlGe at 3 K on the same PPMS. Applied magnetic fields were up to 1000 Oe at a scanning rate of 10.5 Oe/s. The minima of the increase field part of the magnetization curves correspond to the lower critical field, \(H_{c1}\), typically found for type-II superconductors.

Theoretical calculations were performed in the framework of the frozen-core all-electron projected augmented wave (PAW) method, [34] as implemented in the program VASP. [35] The energy cutoff was set to 500 eV. Exchange and correlation effects were treated by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), usually referred to as PW91. [36] The integration over the Brillouin zone was done on special \(k\) points determined according to the Monkhorst-Pack scheme. [37] Total energies were converged to at least 1 meV/atom. For all _MAB_ combinations the unit-cell parameters of the ordered AlB2 type structure (space group \(P\bar{6}m2\)) were optimized for a fixed volume of the unit cell. By repeating this process for different volumes the optimum cell parameters are determined from the global minimum energy.

## III III. Results and Discussion

Arc-melting of stoichiometric elemental mixtures of \(M\), \(A\), and \(B\) affords the compounds _M_AlSi, _M_GaSi, _M_GaGe, and _M_GaSn as well as SrAlGe, BaAlGe, BaInGe, and BaAlSn. Thus our synthesis attempts extending the previously known systems with the new compositions BaGaSn, BaInGe, and BaAlSn. According to x-ray powder-diffraction analysis _MAB_ compounds are obtained phase pure with the exception of CaGaSn and SrGaSn samples, which contained a substantial amount of an unidentified side product. Therefore both compounds were also prepared from stoichiometric elemental mixtures that were sealed in niobium ampoules, heated to 1373 K for 8 h and subsequently cooled to room temperature at a rate of 40 K/h. This resulted in a phase pure sample SrGaSn, which was then employed in the further investigations. For CaGaSn no improvement was observed and accordingly we excluded this compound in the further studies. The sensitivity of powder samples _MAB_ toward air and moisture is different. Silicides are rather stable while stannides and especially the germanides SrAlGe, BaAlGe, and BaInGe decompose rapidly when exposed to air/moisture. Gallium germanides _M_GaGe behave intermediate and react slowly with air/moisture.

### A. Structural properties

The AlB2 structure and its variants relevant for ternary nine-electron systems _MAB_ are compiled in Fig. 1. A detailed overview of structures which can be derived from the AlB2 type by group-subgroup symmetry relations has been given by Hoffmann and Potten. [38] In the simple AlB2 type  (space group \(P6/mmm\)) \(A\)- and \(B\)-type atoms are randomly distributed over the site of the majority atoms forming planar hexagon layers [Fig. 1(a)]. If \(A\) and \(B\) atoms are completely ordered in a way that each atom is coordinated by three unlike ones, the AlB\({}_{2}\)-type unit cell is maintained but space-group symmetry is reduced to \(P6m2\). This results in the SrPtSb structure [Fig. 1(b)]. The hexagonal YPtAs structure (space group \(P6_{3}/mmc\)) can be regarded as a ternary derivative of the AlB\({}_{2}\)-type structure, where puckering of the hexagon layers produces a fourfold superstructure along the \(c\) direction [Fig. 1(c)]. The puckered hexagon layers are now formed by atoms on two different crystallographic sites. As in the AlB\({}_{2}\) structure, the hexagon layers are stacked on top of each other; however the orientation of layers and distribution of atoms produces an arrangement of double layers where \(A\)- and \(B\)-type atoms are located at the inside and outside, respectively.

Most of the previously known systems \(MAB\) have been described as either planar-layer structured AlB\({}_{2}\) and SrPtSb, or strongly puckered YPtAs. Figure 2 shows representatively the powder x-ray diffraction patterns of BaGaGe (AlB\({}_{2}\) type) and CaGaGe (YPtAs type). Note that the puckering of hexagon layers is pronounced in the YPtAs structure and superstructure reflections (with respect to the AlB\({}_{2}\) type) are easily

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c}  & CaAlSi & SrAlSi & BaAlSi & SrAlGe & BaAlGe \\ Space group & \(P6/mmm\) & \(P6/mmm\) & \(P6/mmm\) & \(P6m2\) & \(P6m2\) \\ Structure type & AlB\({}_{2}^{*}\) & AlB\({}_{2}\) & AlB\({}_{2}\) & SrPtSb & SrPtSb \\ \(a\), Å & 4.1860(1) & 4.2433(1) & 4.3001(1) & 4.3043(1) & 4.3512(1) \\ \(c\), Å & 4.3972(1) & 4.7435(1) & 5.1438(1) & 4.7407(1) & 5.1401(1) \\ \(V\), Å\({}^{3}\) & 66.73(1) & 73.97(1) & 82.37(1) & 76.07(1) & 84.28(1)  detectable in powder x-ray diffraction patterns.

The simplest puckered variant of the AlB\({}_{2}\) type, however, is the trigonal EuGe\({}_{2}\) structure [Fig. 1(d)], where the layers are formed from one kind of atoms, oriented the same way, and stacked on top of each other along the \(c\) direction (space group \(P\bar{3}m1\)). Note that this stacking of arsenic-like layers is electron precise for ten electron systems. For ordered ternary variants the space-group symmetry will be reduced to \(P3m1\) [Fig. 1(e)]. Twofold superstructures along the \(c\) direction may arise from an alternate stacking of oppositely oriented puckered hexagon layers [CaIn\({}_{2}\) structure, space group \(P6_{3}/mmc\), Fig. 1(f)] or a different distribution of \(A\) and \(B\) atoms in adjacent planar layers in case of \(A/B\) ordering (ZrBeSi type, space group \(P6_{3}/mmc\), not shown) or a combination of different \(A\)- and \(B\)-type atom distribution and puckering [NdPtSb structure, space group \(P6_{5}mc\), Fig. 1(g)].

Finally, a third group of AlB\({}_{2}\)-type derivatives can be identified, which is based on weakly corrugated hexagon layers that produce complicated stacking sequences. This has been found earlier for CaAlSi. The structures of the polymorphs 5H and 6H are shown in Fig. 3. They have been described as commensurately modulated structures within a (3+1)-dimensional formalism assuming randomly disordered \(A\) and \(B\) atoms,[21] and as conventional superstructures with Al and Si ordered hexagon layers.[25] In the course of this study more examples \(MAB\) displaying modulations from presumably weakly corrugated layers have been identified. Such modulations are hardly detectable in (in-house) powder x-ray

  diffraction experiments,[21] but may reveal in single-crystal diffraction and especially electron diffraction.

(i) _M_AlSi. CaAlSi, SrAlSi, and BaAlSi have been investigated extensively over the recent years.[5, 6, 9, 10, 11] Powder x-ray diffraction patterns show only peaks corresponding to the hexagonal lattice of the AlB\({}_{2}\) structure and the lattice parameters (Table 1) are in good agreement with previous reports. Electron diffraction studies [Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)] reveal readily the sixfold superstructure for CaAlSi and confirm the AlB\({}_{2}\) structure for SrAlSi and BaAlSi. Sparta _et al._ reported that polycrystalline 6H-CaAlSi forms from rapidly cooled samples.[21] This is the case with arc-melting synthesis and thus it appears reasonable that our CaAlSi sample corresponded to the 6H polymorph. As mentioned earlier, the actual distribution of Al and Si on the hexagon layers is most difficult to establish experimentally. This is even the case when applying neutron diffraction because the scattering lengths of Al and Si differ by only 10%. Although Al and Si may have a tendency to order, it is reasonable to assume that our specimens obtained from high-temperature arc melting are to a large extent Al/Si disordered.

(ii) _M_AlGe. Among systems _M_AlGe only SrAlGe and BaAlGe can be prepared. Both compounds have been reported to crystallize with the planar-layer ordered SrPtPb type.[27, 28] This is confirmed by our investigation. Interesting is the pronounced ordering tendency of Al and Ge, which affords the SrPtSb-type samples even from arc melting. Because of the high sensitivity of SrAlGe and BaAlGe toward air/moisture electron microscopy investigations could not be reliably performed.

(iii) _M_AlSn. Among _M_AlSn systems only BaAlSn represents a variant of the AlB\({}_{2}\) structure. The powder x-ray diffraction pattern of BaAlSn is shown in Fig. 5(a). Rietveld refinement yields Al and Sn atoms randomly distributed on the planar hexagon layer, which is surprising when considering that BaAlGe is ordered and that Al and Sn atoms have a rather large size difference.

(iv) _M_GaSi. Like _M_AlSi systems, _M_GaSi ones have been subject to previous investigations.[4, 6] Powder x-ray diffraction

Bragg-peak positions are marked by horizontal bars. In (b) they are also shown for the AlB\({}_{2}\) basic structure to emphasize the location of peaks arising from the fourfold superstructure, i.e., the YPtAs type.

  patterns correspond to the hexagonal lattice of the AlB\({}_{2}\)-type structure and Rietveld refinements indicate no tendency of Ga/Si ordering, which is in agreement with previous reports.[3] However, for CaGaSi electron diffraction [Fig. 4(c)] shows weak rods of diffuse scattering parallel to \(\langle 1100\rangle^{\ast}\) and centered at \(1/6[0001]^{\ast}\). This suggests that Ga/Si atoms are arranged in corrugated layers that produce a sixfold superstructure along the \(c\) direction [similar to GH-CaAlSi, cf. Fig. 3(a)], but at the same time there is displacive disorder within the hexagonal \(ab\) plane. Electron diffraction confirms the AlB\({}_{2}\) structure for SrGaSi and BaGaSi.

(v) _M_GaGe. Gallium germanide compounds have been reported with the puckered-layer ordered YPtAs-type.[26] Our results differ. While powder x-ray diffraction shows clearly the fourfold superstructure for CaGaGe of the YPtAs type [cf. Fig. 2(b)], it is absent for SrGaGe and BaGaGe [cf. Fig. 2(a)] and the latter compounds can be refined in the planar-layer AlB\({}_{2}\) structure. Electron diffraction shows subtle variations for CaGaGe and SrGaGe [Figs. 6(a) and 6(b)]. For CaGaGe, a careful inspection of the zone axis electron-diffraction patterns reveal the existence of an incommensurately modulated structure with \(\mathbf{q}\)  \(\approx\) (1/4-\(\delta\)[0001]\({}^{\ast}\), where \(\delta\) is small. (Note that \(\delta\)=0 gives a \(\mathbf{q}\) vector of (1/4)[0001]\({}^{\ast}\), which corresponds to the fourfold commensurate superstructure of the AlB\({}_{2}\)-type present in the YPtAs structure.) This peculiarity is also present in the [1100] zone axis where additionally the first-order satellites reflections are absent as a result of the \(c\) glide along [0001]. For SrGaGe, weak superstructure reflections correspond to a commensurate fivefold superstructure along the hexagonal \(c\) direction, which resembles the situation of the 5H-CaAlSi structure. BaGaGe was confirmed to possess the lattice of the AlB\({}_{2}\) structure.

(vi) _M_GaSn. CaGaSn and SrGaSn were previously known and reported with the YPtAs structure.[26] This is confirmed in our powder x-ray diffraction patterns and for SrGaSn additionally by electron diffraction. Interestingly, the new compound BaGaSn displays a different structural behavior. At first sight, the analysis of the powder x-ray diffraction pattern yields the AlB\({}_{2}\)-type structure for BaGaSn with randomly distributed Ga and Sn atoms [Fig. 5(b)]. However, electron diffraction reveals weak superstructure reflections which correspond to a doubling of the AlB\({}_{2}\)\(c\) axis [Fig. 4(d)]. This is compatible with two types of puckered hexagon layers that are mutually rotated by 60\({}^{\circ}\) (and stacked in "antiphase" ori

The subscript p indicates indexing according to the parent hexagonal AlB\({}_{2}\) type structure. The magnified areas in (a), (b), and (c) stress deviations from the parent AlB\({}_{2}\) type structure. Note that pattern (a) displays a threefold superstructure that becomes a sixfold superstructure when the crystal is tilted from (a) to (b). Such extinction condition corresponds to the presence of a \(c\) glide along [0001]\({}^{\ast}\) of the superstructure.

Bragg-peak positions are marked by horizontal bars. BaGaSn, (b), was refined in the CaIn\({}_{2}\) structure. The Bragg positions of the AlB\({}_{2}\) basic structure are also shown.

  entation). The arrangement is isopointated to ordered NdPtSb or ScAuSi.[38] However, reflection conditions indicate space group \(P6_{3}/mmc\), which implies randomly disordered Ga and Sn. Indeed, a subsequent Rietveld refinement of this structure model from the powder x-ray data leads to a significant improvement over the AlB\({}_{2}\) type (\(R_{\rm wp}\)=4.59 vs 5.13 for the former and latter, respectively). Thus BaGaSn should be considered as isostructural to CaIn\({}_{2}\) with weakly puckered hexagon layers [cf. Fig. 1(f)].

(vii) \(M\)InGe. In contrast to the manifold of \(M\)\(AB\) systems which exists with \(A\) = Al, Ga, only one indium compound can be prepared, BaInGe. This compound has not been reported previously. Powder x-ray diffraction indicates the presence of a superstructure with respect to an AlB\({}_{2}\)-type lattice [Fig. 5(c)]. Indeed, electron diffraction [Fig. 6(d)] reveals clearly satellite reflections corresponding to a wave vector **q** =(1/3 - \(\delta\))[0001]\({}^{\circ}\) and the structure of BaInGe displays actually an incommensurately modulated corrugation of the hexagon layers. This corrugation appears to be rather pronounced. Rietveld refinement of the basic structure from the powder x-ray data shows a clear tendency for hexagon layer puckering (cf. Table II; \(R_{\rm wp}\)=4.17 vs 4.59 for puckered and flat layer structure, respectively) and a random distribution of In and Ge atoms on these layers. This corresponds to the EuGe\({}_{2}\) structure [cf. Fig. 1(d)].

In conclusion, ternary nine-electron systems \(M\)\(AB\) offer a wide variety in terms of chemical compositions. The basic crystal structures are the disordered AlB\({}_{2}\) and the ordered SrPtSb structure, both based on planar hexagon layers, and the ordered puckered-layer YPtAs structure. Apart from them, subtle variations occur, which originate from various degrees of layer corrugations and/or ordering of \(A\) and \(B\) atoms. Those variations represent commensurately and incommensurately modulated superstructures with respect to the AlB\({}_{2}\) type and may be considered as intermediates between the planar-layer and strongly puckered-layer border cases. The ordering tendency of \(A\)- and \(B\)-type atoms within hexagon layers varies. Interestingly, it seems to be most pronounced for the pair Al and Ge. However, this should depend on the thermal history of the samples and in this respect no investigations were performed within this study. Also, the occurrence of polymorphism most likely correlates to the thermal history, which could explain that by arc melting we obtained SrGaGe and BaGaGe with a different crystal structure compared to the previously reported one.

The only flexible parameter of the simple AlB\({}_{2}\) structure is the \(c/a\) ratio. The \(c\) parameter is especially affected by the size of the \(M\) component. For Ca compounds this parameter is between 4.3 and 4.45 A, whereas for Sr and Ba compounds the range is 4.68\(-\)4.78 A and 5.1\(-\)5.15 A, respec

The subscript p indicates indexing according to the parent hexagonal AlB\({}_{2}\) type structure. Magnified areas of the diffraction patterns stress deviations from the parent AlB\({}_{2}\) type structure. Note that in pattern (a) first- and second-order satellite reflections are present while in (b) only the latter are observed. Such extinction condition corresponds to the presence of a \(c\) glidelike symmetry relation between the puckering patterns in neighboring layers.

  tively (cf. Table 1). The \(a\) parameter is certainly also affected by \(M\), but mostly determined by the length of the _A_-_B_ bond. In this respect simple geometrical considerations may be used to establish empirically the stability of planar-layer structures AlB2 and SrPtPb versus the puckered variants. In the AlB2-type structure the \(M\) component is sandwiched in between two _AB_ hexagon rings. If the rings become too large for coordinating \(M\) atoms, puckering is induced. We computed the equilibrium lattice parameters for all _MAB_ systems in the SrPtSb structure by first-principles calculations (cf. Sec. II) and extracted the _A_-_B_ bond length. In those cases where _MAB_ actually adopts the AlB2 or SrPtSb structure (cf. Table 1), the calculated distance deviated at the most by 1% from the experimental one.

Figure 7 shows the distribution of computed _A_-_B_ distances for each \(M\). Additionally, the different \(M\) series are separated according to the metallic radius of \(M\) (Ca =1.97 A, Sr=2.15 A, Ba=2.21 A).[40] It is apparent that combinations \(A\) = Al, Ga with \(B\) = Si, Ge result in rather similar _A_-_B_ distances, while introducing \(A\) = In or \(B\) = Sn elongates them considerably. The shortest distance occurs for the pair Ga-Si, the longest for In-Ge. For short _A_-_B_ distances typically the planar-layer structure is realized. However, for small-sized \(M\) = Ca even CaGaSi appears modulated. Further, the puckered YPtAs structure is already adopted in CaGaGe although the modulation we identified there (cf. Fig. 6) may indicate that it is not fully expressed yet. For medium-sized \(M\) = Sr the boundaries are shifted. SrGaSi and SrAlSi clearly have a planar-layer structure, while modulations appear for SrGaGe and the puckered YPtAs structure for SrGaSn. Finally, for large-sized \(M\) = Ba there is a large number of representatives with a planar-layer structure and apparently no pair _AB_ can afford a distance large enough for inducing the YPtAs structure. Perhaps BaInGe is close to realizing the YPtAs structure, as indicated by the strongly corrugated layer refined for the basic structure (cf. Table 2). Figure 7 suggests that the kind of AlB2-type variant a system _MAB_ adopts is related to the ratio of the size of \(M\) and the size of the coordinating _AB_ hexagon ring. The indicated boundaries separating the three fields of structures are not precisely defined. BaAlSn would fall in the field of modulated structures while it was found to adopt the planar-layer AlB2 structure. However, electron diffraction, which could not be performed here, may actually reveal a modulated structure. Finally we note that the empirical relation established in Fig. 7 are not restricted to _MAB_ main group systems but extends to EuGaB and to the recently characterized system Eu(Zn1-Ge)2.[39, 41]

### Magnetic susceptibility

Figure 8 shows the temperature dependence of the dc magnetization for systems _MAB_. Additionally the onsets of superconducting critical temperatures, _T\({}_{c}\)_, are compiled in Table 3. The superconducting properties of silicides _MA_lSi and _M_GaSi [Figs. 8(a) and 8(b)] have been extensively investigated since the year 2001.[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] The polymorphs of CaAlSi--1H, 5H, 6H--have a distinctively different _T\({}_{c}\)_. Our measurement shows a _T\({}_{c}\)_ at 7.8 K, in close agreement to what has been reported for the 6H polymorph.[22] Further, we obtain a _T\({}_{c}\)_ of 4.7 K for SrAlSi, which is similar to what has been reported in the literature (4.2 and 5.1 K) and confirm the absence of superconductivity above 2 K for BaAlSi.[10] Also for _M_GaSi our values for _T\({}_{c}\)_ (4.4, 4.9, and 4.2 K for \(M\) = Ca, Sr, Ba, respectively) are similar to earlier reports.[46]

\end{table}

  Here we note that the trend of \(T_{c}\) for the series \(M\)GaSi is different compared to \(M\)AISi: CaGaSi has a lower \(T_{c}\) than SrGaSi, and BaGaSi is superconducting above 2 K but not BaAlSi. The reason for this different behavior is not clear. The superconductivity of the silicides \(M\)AISi and \(M\)GaSi is of type-II. We performed ZFC and FC measurements for CaAlSi, SrAlSi, SrGaSi, and BaGaSi where magnetization saturates above 2 K. The obtained magnetic shielding fractions in ZFC and flux exclusions in FC at 2 K were in agreement with earlier reports.[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

It is interesting now to look at the superconducting behavior of the germanide and stannide systems. Here we find SrAlGe and BaAlGe superconducting at 6.75 and 6.25 K, respectively [Fig. 8(c)]. These are after CaAlSi the highest \(T_{c}\) values among nine-electron \(M\)\(\Delta\)\(\overline{\text{A}}\) systems. It can be speculated that CaAlGe may even display a higher \(T_{c}\) if accessible by synthesis. Furthermore, SrGaGe and BaGaGe are superconductors [Fig. 8(d)], but now \(T_{c}\) is considerably lower compared to aluminum germanides (2.6 and 2.4 K for \(M\) =Sr, Ba, respectively). CaGaGe, with the puckered-layer YPtAs structure, is not superconducting above 2 K. The same holds for BaInGe and the gallium stannides \(M\)GaSn, which crystallize with either the YPtAs structure or a modulated AlB\({}_{2}\) variant with substantial layer corrugation (e.g., BaInGe). Finally BaAlSn displays superconductivity above 2 K [Fig. 8(e)]. The \(T_{c}\), however, is fairly low, 2.9 K, especially when compared to BaAlGe (\(T_{c}\)=6.3 K). Due to their low \(T_{c}\) values the magnetization of SrGaGe, BaGaGe, and BaAlSn does not saturate above 2 K and we are not able to rigorously proof that superconductivity in these compounds is a bulk effect. However, the absence of (crystalline) impurities in the x-ray powder patterns indicates bulk superconductivity. Also superconductivity originating from traces of metallic elements and/or alloys can be excluded. For BaAlSn the transition temperature is rather different from that of elemental Sn (3.72 K). Also, Al is only slightly soluble in Sn, with a maximum solubility of about 0.7 at. % Al and this is found to have little effect on the transition temperature.[42]

The rather high \(T_{c}\) values of SrAlGe and BaAlGe allowed for a more detailed characterization of their superconductivity properties. Figure 9 shows the dc magnetization of SrAlGe and BaAlGe in ZFC and FC. In FC a Meissner effect (flux exclusion) occurs. The magnetic shielding fraction in ZFC exceeds 90% of the theoretical value of perfect diamagnetism (1/4 \(\pi\)) at 2 K for both compounds.[43] The flux exclusion in FC at 2 K is about 10% for SrAlGe and about 50% for BaAlGe. This confirms that SrAlGe and BaAlGe are bulk superconductors. The dc magnetization as a function of the magnetic field (insets in Fig. 9) shows type-II behavior with a lower critical field (\(H_{\text{c1}}\)) around 100 Oe and an upper critical field above 1000 Oe.

In conclusion, we find that superconductivity in ternary nine-electron systems \(M\)\(\Delta\)\(\overline{\text{A}}\)\(\overline{\text{B}}\) is not restricted to silicides but extends to germanides and stannides. The occurrence of superconductivity clearly relates to the planarity of \(\Delta\)\(\overline{\text{B}}\) hexagon layers: A transition above 2 K is absent in AlB\({}_{2}\)-type variants where layers are substantially puckered (YPtAs-type stannides, CaIn\({}_{2}\)-type BaGaSn, and incommensurately modulated BaInGe). This, however, remains the only obvious correlation between structural and superconducting properties. For modulated AlB\({}_{2}\) variants with weakly corrugated hexagon layers, the structural influence to \(T_{c}\) is more complex. For instance, \(T_{c}\) is markedly different for the different polymorphs of CaAlSi, but varies irregularly as a function of the \(c\) translational period: 1H--6.5 K, 5H--5.7 K, 6H--7.7 K. Furthermore, while the planarity of \(\Delta\)\(\overline{\text{B}}\) hexagon layers appears to be a necessary condition for superconductivity above 2 K it is by no means sufficient. For the planar-layer systems \(M\)AISi it has been speculated that \(T_{c}\) correlates with the \(c/a\) ratio of the AlB\({}_{2}\) structure, and the missing superconductivity of BaAlSi is a consequence of a too large \(c/a\) ratio.[10] However, for \(M\)GaSi this hypothesis does not apply.

When attempting to correlate elemental composition of \(M\)\(\Delta\)\(\overline{\text{B}}\) systems with superconductivity perhaps a general trend is that within an \(M\)-series Ba compounds will show the lowest \(T_{c}\), or are even not superconducting above 2 K, and \(T_{c}\) is always high for \(A\)=Al compounds. The latter observation contradicts the earlier made assumption that silicon is the major prerequisite for superconductivity in nine-electron \(M\)\(\Delta\)\(\overline{\text{B}}\) systems. While it has been shown that \(A/B\) ordering is of minor importance to superconducting properties for silicides (\(M\)AISi and \(M\)GaSi) (Refs. [16, 22]) it may be important for germanides and stannides. Here we are not able to draw conclusions.

The present understanding of superconductivity in nine-electron systems \(M\)\(\Delta\)\(\overline{\text{B}}\) is that a low-frequency mode associated with the out-of-plane phonons (optic \(B_{1g}\) and acoustic \(A_{2u}\) at \(\Gamma\) with respect to the \(P6/mmm\) AlB\({}_{2}\) structure), which is soft in the upper half of the Brillouin zone (i.e., the boundary \(k_{z}\)= \(\pi\)/a), couples to the Fermi-level electrons in the par

  tial occupied \(\pi^{*}\) band situated at the same location of the Brillouin zone.[14; 15; 16; 17] Additionally a second band crossing the Fermi level, that has \(M\)-\(dz^{2}\) character, is important. The presence of the soft mode has been shown by theoretical calculations for the AlB\({}_{2}\)-type systems \(MA\)ISi and \(M\)GaSi, and explicitly confirmed by inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering experiments for 1H-CaAlSi.[18; 19] Our findings cast a number of questions:

(1) The soft mode is apparently still present in the modulated layer AlB\({}_{2}\) variants displaying superconductivity. A recent theoretical analysis of the phonon dispersion of 5H- and 6H-CaAlSi found that the soft mode of the 1H polymorph, although due to zone folding now representing a branch, is virtually unchanged by the modulated corrugation of hexagon layers.[24] This is not necessarily expected if the soft mode for 1H-CaAlSi, as speculated in Ref. [18], expresses a structural instability toward layer corrugation or puckering, which then actually occurs in the 5H and 6H polymorphs. So, how will the soft mode change when going to the more strongly puckered AlB\({}_{2}\)-type variants and finally the YPtAs structure? How susceptible is the soft mode to compositional variations in \(A\) and \(B\)?

(2) How is the \(\pi^{*}\) band developing as a function of composition, hexagon layer separation, and layer puckering? This band has its major contribution from \(A\)-type atom \(p_{z}\) orbitals. Is there anything special for \(A\) = Al explaining the generally higher \(T_{c}\) values for aluminum compounds? Answering these questions should provide a deeper insight into the electron-phonon coupling mechanism in nine-electron ternary systems \(MAB\).

## IV Conclusions

The ternary nine-electron intermetallics systems \(MAB\) (\(M\) = Ca, Sr, Ba; \(A\) = Al, Ga, In; \(B\) = Si, Ge, Sn) offer a wide variety in terms of chemical compositions. Many silicides (\(B\) = Si) have been identified earlier as superconductors above 2 K. \(MAB\) compounds crystallize with the simple hexagonal AlB\({}_{2}\) structure or some variant of it. The variations manifest as an ordering of \(A\) and \(B\) atoms, a puckering of the hexagon layers, or both. The presence and degree of puckering appears to be related to the ratio of the size of \(M\) (atomic or ionic radius) and the size of the hexagon ring in the layers as defined by the distance between \(A\) and \(B\) atoms. When the rings become too large for coordinating \(M\) atoms, puckering of the layers is induced. A large size mismatch results in the YPtAs-type structure where \(AB\) layer puckering is most pronounced.

Superconductivity in nine-electron \(MAB\) systems is not just restricted to aluminum and gallium silicides, but also extends to germanides (SrAlGe, BaAlGe, SrGaGe, BaGaGe) and even stannides (BaAlSn). A prerequisite for superconductivity above 2 K is the presence of planar or weakly corrugated hexagon layers. Superconductivity is clearly absent in representatives with the puckered-layer YPtAs structure. Furthermore, it appears that \(T_{c}\) is lowest or nonexistent above 2 K in a series \(MAB\) when \(M\) = Ba, and is highest when \(A\) = Al (with the notable exception of BaAlSi). The manifold of representatives makes the nine-electron systems \(MAB\) a unique playground for further investigations of compositional and structural variations to electron-phonon coupling phenomena in this class of conventional superconductors.
