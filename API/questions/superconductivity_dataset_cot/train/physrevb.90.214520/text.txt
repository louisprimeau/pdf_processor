###### Abstract

A series of (Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe1-xSx (0 \(\leqslant x\leqslant\) 1) samples were successfully synthesized via hydrothermal reaction method and the phase diagram is established. Magnetic susceptibility suggests that an antiferromagnetism arising from (Li0.8Fe0.2)OH layers coexists with superconductivity, and the antiferromagnetic transition temperature nearly remains constant for various S doping levels. In addition, the lattice parameters of the both \(a\) and \(c\) axes decrease and the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) is gradually suppressed with the substitution of S for Se, and eventually superconductivity vanishes at \(x\) = 0.90. The decrease of \(T_{c}\) could be attributed to the effect of chemical pressure induced by the smaller ionic size of S relative to that of Se, being consistent with the effect of hydrostatic pressure on (Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe. But the detailed investigation on the relationships between \(T_{c}\) and the crystallographic facts suggests a very different dependence of \(T_{c}\) on anion height from the Fe2 layer or \(Ch\)-Fe2-\(Ch\) angle from those in FeAs-based superconductors.

Since the discovery of superconductivity in LaFeAsO1-_x_Fx with \(T_{c}\sim\) 26 K [1], the iron-based superconductors, as the second family of compounds exhibiting high \(T_{\rm c}\) after the cuprates, have attracted wide attention [2, 3, 4]. \(\beta\)-FeSe, which shows superconducting transition at \(\sim\)10 K and owns the simplest crystal structure among iron-based superconductors, is thought to be a promising system to investigate the mechanism of high \(T_{\rm c}\) superconductivity in iron-based superconductors [5]. By applying hydrostatic pressure or intercalating alkali atoms between FeSe layers (with chemical formula \(A_{x}\)Fe2-ySe2 [\(A\) = K, Rb, Cs, Tl/K, Tl/Rb, etc.], the \(T_{\rm c}\) could be enhanced to higher than 30 K [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. However, in \(A_{x}\)Fe2-ySe2, the obvious phase separation between the superconducting phase and the intergrown antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulating phase with an extremely high Neel temperature of \(\sim\)560 K and Fe vacancy ordering [11, 12, 13, 14], makes it difficult to study the underlying physics of FeSe layers. In addition, other FeSe-derived superconductors, such as alkali-metal ions and NH3 molecules or organic-molecules intercalated FeSe [15, 16, 17, 18], are extremely air sensitive, which prevents the further investigation of their physical properties. Thus, it is urgent to find other FeSe-derived superconductors with new spacer layers.

In iron-based superconductors, both carrier doping and isovalent substitution can tune the superconducting properties [4, 19]. Similar to the external pressure effect, isovalent substitution would not change carrier density but could introduce or enhance superconductivity, as found in the iron arsenides [19, 20]. For instance, through substituting As with isovalent P, bulk superconductivity emerges in LaFeAs1-_x_PxO with \(T_{\rm c}\) of 10.8 K, which is understood in terms of chemical pressure and bond covalency [20]. However, in FeSe-derived superconductors K\({}_{x}\)Fe2-_y_Se2-_x_S, the \(T_{\rm c}\) is suppressed with S substituting for Se, and goes to zero at 80% of S, which has been attributed to the increase of Fe-Se tetrahedron irregularity and Fe1 site occupancy [21]. Recently, an air-stable FeSe-derived superconductor (Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe was reported with \(T_{\rm c}\) of \(\sim\)40 K and the precise crystal structure has been unambiguously determined [22, 23]. Moreover, there exists a canted AFM order originating from the (Li0.8Fe0.2)OH layer, which coexists with superconductivity. In this work, we report on the successful synthesis of (Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe1-_x_Sx (0 \(\leqslant\)\(x\leqslant\) 1) by using a hydrothermal reaction method. The evolution of superconducting properties and structure parameters with S content in (Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe1-_x_S_x are investigated. The results reveal that both \(a\)- and \(c\)-axis lattice parameters decrease almost linearly with the increase of S content. Superconductivity is suppressed by the substitution of S for Se, and finally vanishes at \(x\) = 0.90. Moreover, the AFM order locating within the (Li0.8Fe0.2)OH layer coexists with superconductivity, and the AFM transition temperature almost remains unchanged with S content.

A series of (Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe1-_x_S_x samples with nominal composition \(x=0.0\)-1.0 were synthesized by a hydrothermal reaction method, as described in the previous report [22, 23]. First, in order to ensure the reagents were fully dissolved and mixed, 0.012-0.02 mol selenouera (Alfa Aesar, 99.97% purity) and sulfourea (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, A.R. purity) were stoichiometrically weighted, dissolved in 10 ml water, and stirred for 10-20 min in the Teflon-lined autoclave. Then 0.0075 mol Fe powder (Aladdin Industrial, A.R. purity) and 12 g LiOH-H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, A.R. purity) were thrown into the autoclave and mixed. Finally, the Teflon-lined autoclave was tightly sealed and heated at 150-160 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 3-10 days. The polycrystalline samples acquired from the reaction systems were washed with deionized water repeatedly, and dried at room temperature.

Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) data of samples were collected by using an x-ray diffractometer (SmartLab-9, Rikagu Corp.) with Cu \(K\alpha\) radiation and a fixed graphite monochromator in the 2-\(\theta\) range of 5\({}^{\circ}\)-70\({}^{\circ}\) at room temperature. The average stoichiometries of Fe, Se, and S of the polycrystalline samples were determined from energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis. The actual S contents \(x\) were determined by EDX to be 0, 0.08, 0.16, 0.22, 0.28, 0.41, 0.53, 0.66, 0.77, 0.90, and 1.0 for the 11 samples used in this work with the nominal molar reagents ratios of sulfourea/(sulfourea + selenourea) = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0, respectively. Magnetization measurements were carried out on SQUID MPMS-XL5 (Quantum Design). Refinements of the XRD data were performed by using gSAS software [24,25].

Powder XRD patterns of (Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe1-_x_S samples are shown in Fig. 1(a), all of which were collected at room temperature. The XRD patterns of (Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe1-_x_S are similar to that of (Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe and all reflections can be well indexed by the tetragonal structure on the basis of the space group of \(P4/nmm\) (No. 129), except for the broad one at about \(2\theta=16^{\circ}\). The broad reflection at \(2\theta\approx 16^{\circ}\) may be attributed to the nanoscale FeS produced in the low-temperature synthesis procedure [26]. As shown in Fig. 1(a), all reflections shift to the higher \(2\theta\) side with the increase

  of S content. Figure 1(b) shows the evolution of the lattice parameters along the \(a\) and \(c\) axes as a function of S content \(x\). With increasing \(x\), the lattice parameters along both the \(a\) and \(c\) axes monotonically decrease, indicating the lattice contraction with increasing S content, which is consistent with the relatively smaller ionic size of S\({}^{2-}\) compared with Se\({}^{2-}\). As a result, the unit cell volume \(V=a\times a\times c\) also decreases monotonically. The lattice shrinking progressively with S substitution is consistent with Vegard's law, which is similar to K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2-y}\)Se\({}_{2-z}\)S\({}_{z}\) and FeSe\({}_{1-x}\)S\({}_{x}\)[21, 27].

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility \(\chi\) for the superconducting samples under a magnetic field of 10 Oe. \(T_{\rm c}\) determined from zero-field-cooling (ZFC) magnetic susceptibility shifts gradually to low temperature as the S content increases. When S content increases up to \(x=0.90\), no diamagnetic signal can be observed above 5 K and the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility shows paramagnetic behavior. Additionally, the shielding fractions at 5 K of (Li\({}_{0.8}\)Fe\({}_{0.2}\))OHFeSe\({}_{1-x}\)S\({}_{x}\) (\(x=0.16\)) estimated from the ZFC curves is 69%, suggesting a bulk superconductivity at 37 K. The \(M\)-\(H\) loop of the \(x=0.16\) sample measured at 5 K is presented in the inset of Fig. 2(a). A linear-\(H\) dependence of diamagnetic magnetization with negative slope can be observed up to \(\sim\)150 Oe, which is in accordance with the superconducting transition observed in the temperature dependence of susceptibility. According to Mizuguchi's report [27], the S substitution in FeSe can stabilize the superconducting state. However, in our case, the sizes of crystalline grains from a low-temperature solution synthetic method are usually small and reduce the superconductive shielding fraction of samples, especially when \(x\) exceeds 0.50.

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility \(\chi\) for \(x=0\) and 0.28 samples from 2 to 300 K by applying an external field of 1 T. The superconductivity seemed to be suppressed under this field. However, the magnetic order in the (Li\({}_{0.8}\)Fe\({}_{0.2}\))OH layer creates an internal field and completely suppresses the Meissner effect under 1 T. Thus, there is no diamagnetic signal observed under 1 T. Moreover, the temperature dependence of magnetization displays a Curie-Weiss behavior above 10 K. A sudden decrease in the \(\chi\) happens in the ZFC curve around 8 K for both of the samples with \(x=0\) and 0.28. FC and ZFC magnetic susceptibilities bifurcate for both samples at about 8 K. The bifurcation is

  quite weak, suggesting a weak ferromagnetic component due to a possible canted antiferromagnetic order, as derived from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements in other work [28]. The temperatures corresponding to the maximum of the ZFC susceptibility and the bifurcating temperature of ZFC and FC susceptibilities for the sample with \(x\) = 0.28 are almost the same as those observed in the S-free sample, strongly suggesting that this magnetic order is formed within the (Li0.8Fe0.2)OH layers, so that the substitution of S for Se cannot affect the magnetic transition. This is consistent with the NMR results in our other work, indicating that this magnetic ordered state originated from the (Li0.8Fe0.2)OH layers [28].

In order to confirm the AFM transition, we performed thermodynamic measurements. Figure 4 shows the specific heat measured under different magnetic fields. The specific heat for all the samples with different S contents begins to rise at about 8 K, which is consistent with the anomaly temperature in the magnetic susceptibility. Such rise is suppressed with increasing magnetic fields and becomes very obscure as the field increases up to 9 T. Surprisingly, the temperature for the maximum of specific heat remains unshifted at 5 K in various magnetic fields. These features are consistent with the antiferromagnetic order proposed above. These results further suggest that the AFM ordering should arise from the (Li0.8Fe0.2)OH layer.

Based on the magnetic measurements displayed in Figs. 2 and 3 as well as the thermodynamic results shown in Fig. 4, the phase diagram is mapped out for the (Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe1-xS\({}_{x}\) (\(0\leqslant x\leqslant 1\)), as shown in Fig. 5, where _T_c is determined by susceptibility and magnetic transition temperature is determined by the specific heat. The _T_c gradually decreases and vanishes at \(x\) = 0.90, although the substituted S is isovalent to Se. The decrease of _T_c is accompanied by the reduction of the _a_- and _c_-axis lattice parameters, suggesting the suppression effect of the chemical pressure on _T_c. This is in accordance with the suppression effect of external pressure on superconductivity in (Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe.

It is believed that there are close relationships between _T_c and crystallographic details. In our case, there is no other Fe site between the (Li0.8Fe0.2)OH layer and the FeSe1-xS\({}_{x}\) layer, and both the chalcogen (_Ch_) anion height from the Fe2 layer and the Fe2-_Ch_ bond distance in FeSe1-xS\({}_{x}\) slab monotonically decrease with increasing S content, as shown in Fig. 6(a). The evolution of the _Ch_-Fe2-_Ch_ angle in the Fe2-_Ch_ tetrahedron is shown in Fig. 6(b). The _Ch_-Fe2-_Ch_ angles change towards the ideal value of a regular tetrahedron (109.47\({}^{\circ}\)). According to a previous report [29], _T_c is closely connected to the anion height from the Fe layer (_h_) and a maximum _T_c could be achieved with \(h\)0  1.38 A for FeAs-derived superconductors. For the FeSe-derived superconductors, the anion height dependence of _T_c has been established as a V shape [22] with a minimum _T_c at \(h\) = 1.45 A [22], distinct from the inverse V-shaped one in FeAs-based superconductors. Both S and Te substitutions for Se in FeSe would enhance _T_c [27,30], which could be attributed to the variation of anion height and follow the law of V-shape dependence of _T_c. However, in regard to K\({}_{x}\)Fe2-ySe2-zS\({}_{z}\), the anion height dependence of _T_c violates this law, which can be explained in terms of the existence of the Fe vacancies, which results in a nonmonotonic change of the anion height with S content [21]. In Fig. 6(c), we plot _T_c as a function of chalcogen height from the Fe layer for (Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe1-xS\({}_{x}\), which shows that the _T_c is monotonically decreased with shrinking of the anion height from the Fe layer, with no sudden change in slope at \(h\) = 1.38 or 1.45 A. This does not follow the previous V shape in FeSe-derived superconductors or the inverse V shape in FeAs-based superconductors, suggesting the existence of peculiar physics in the (Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe1-xS\({}_{x}\) system. In FeAs-based superconductors, it is also thought that the regular tetrahedron of FeAs4 might favor higher _T_c and this might hold in FeSe-derived superconductors. However, Fig. 6(d) shows that _T_c decreases monotonically as the _Ch_-Fe2-_Ch_ angle goes to the ideal value of a regular tetrahedron, implying that a tetrahedron distortion in FeSe-derived superconductors may promote the superconductivity.

Another intriguing phenomenon of the phase diagram shown in Fig. 5 is that although the _T_c can be effectively

  suppressed by S substitution, the AFM transition temperature remains almost unchanged. In the superconducting region of S content, AFM ordering exists deeply inside the superconducting state and coexists with superconductivity in the whole region, but seems to have no connection with the superconductivity. For a conventional superconductor, local magnetic moments or magnetic order is usually unfavorable to superconductivity. However, AFM order from (Li\({}_{0.8}\)Fe\({}_{0.2}\))OH layers seems not to affect superconductivity occurring in the conducting FeSe layers for (Li\({}_{0.8}\)Fe\({}_{0.2}\))OHFeSe\({}_{1-x}\)S\({}_{x}\). Actually, it is found in FeAs-based superconductors that magnetism or magnetic moments outside the conducting FeAs layers can have negligible suppression effect on superconductivity. In Eu\({}_{1-x}\)La\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), AFM can also exist deep inside the superconducting region with both \(T_{\rm c}\) and AFM transition temperature increasing with enhancing external pressure [31]. Replacement of magnetic Nd, Pr, Sm, and Gd for nonmagnetic La in LaFeAsO\({}_{1-x}\)F\({}_{x}\) or LaFeAsO\({}_{1-\delta}\) can enhance \(T_{\rm c}\) effectively [2,3,32,33]. These facts strongly manifest the unconventional superconductivity in the Fe-based superconductors. It also suggests that the correlation along the \(c\) axis plays a trivial role in the superconductivity in the Fe-based superconductors.

In summary, we successfully synthesized a series of (Li\({}_{0.8}\)Fe\({}_{0.2}\))OHFeSe\({}_{1-x}\)S\({}_{x}\) (\(0\leqslant x\leqslant 1\)) samples through the hydrothermal method. Due to the smaller ionic size of S relative to that of Se, the S substitution leads to shrinking of the lattice parameters both along the \(a\) axis and the \(c\) axis. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat were also studied. Based on the magnetic susceptibility and thermodynamic results of all the samples, the phase diagram of (Li\({}_{0.8}\)Fe\({}_{0.2}\))OHFeSe\({}_{1-x}\)S\({}_{x}\) is mapped out. \(T_{\rm c}\) is suppressed from 40 K to zero as S content increases from 0 to 0.90. The effect of chemical pressure resulting from S substitution for Se is considered as a possible mechanism of the suppression of \(T_{\rm c}\), which is in agreement with the effect of external pressure previously investigated in (Li\({}_{0.8}\)Fe\({}_{0.2}\))OHFeSe. But the relationships between \(T_{\rm c}\) and the crystallographic details reveal that the dependence of \(T_{\rm c}\) on anion height from the Fe2 layer or the \(Ch\)-Fe2-\(Ch\) angle is distinct from those summarized in FeAs-based superconductors. Magnetic susceptibility at 1 T and the specific heat suggest that an AFM transition around 8 K originates from (Li\({}_{0.8}\)Fe\({}_{0.2}\))OH layers. The magnetic transition temperature does not alter with S concentration, and superconductivity coexists with antiferromagnetism in the superconducting region of S content.
