###### Abstract

Using high-pressure magnetotransport techniques we have discovered superconductivity in Bi_{2}Te, a member of the infinitely adaptive \mathbf{(Bi_{2})_{m}(Bi_{2}Te_{3})_{n}} series, whose end members, Bi and Bi_{1}Te_{8}, can be tuned to display topological surface states or superconductivity. Bi_{2}Te has a maximum T_{\text{c}}=8.6\,K at P=14.5\,GPa and goes through multiple high-pressure phase transitions, ultimately collapsing into a bcc structure that suggests a universal behavior across the series. High-pressure magnetoresistance and Hall measurements suggest a semimetal to metal transition near 5.4 GPa, which accompanies the hexagonal to intermediate phase transition seen via x-ray diffraction measurements. In addition, the linearity of H_{\text{c2}}(T) exceeds the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg limit, even in the extreme spin-orbit scattering limit, yet is consistent with other strong spin-orbit materials. Considering these results in combination with similar reports on strong spin-orbit scattering materials seen in the literature, we suggest the need for a new theory that can address the unconventional nature of their superconducting states.

## 1 Introduction

The past several years have seen a large volume of research dedicated to materials whose properties are driven by the topology of their quantum states [1]. These states realize long theorized exotic quantum-mechanical effects, such as Weyl fermions, predicted nearly a century ago [2,3], and others, such as topological insulators (TIs) and topological superconductors, predicted only a few years ago [4,5]. One of the more exciting prospects of TIs is that with proximity-induced superconductivity [6] they provide the Z_{2} nontrivial state allowing for promising applications in spintronics and quantum computation [7] as well as the experimental realization of Majorana fermions [8].

One of the key properties necessary for making a TI is strong spin-orbit coupling, first discovered in HgTe quantum wells and later found in several bismuth-based chalcogenides [9, 10, 11, 12]. A particularly interesting family of these materials is the infinitely adaptive series (A_{2})_{m}(A_{2}Q_{3})_{n} with A=(\text{Bi},\text{Sb}) and Q=(\text{Se},\text{Te}). Although members of this series are well known as some of the best thermoelectric materials, they were recently found to be topological insulators as well [13, 14, 15, 16]. In particular, the end members of the infinitely adaptive (\text{Bi}_{2})_{m}(\text{Bi}_{2}\text{Te}_{3})_{n} series, Bi and Bi_{2}Te_{3}, can be experimentally tuned to display topological surface states or superconductivity under appropriate conditions [11, 17, 18, 19].

In our search for functional materials that possess these exotic properties we synthesized and studied Bi_{2}Te, a member of the (\text{Bi}_{2})_{m}(\text{Bi}_{2}\text{Te}_{3})_{n} series, with m=2 and n=1. Containing a Bi fraction of 0.67, Bi_{2}Te is on the Bi-rich side of this series, which spans the spectrum from pure Bi (m=3:n=0) to Bi_{2}Te_{3} (m=0:n=3). Similar to other members of this series [20, 21, 22], Bi_{2}Te transforms from an ambient pressure semimetal to a high-pressure superconductor, progressing through multiple structural and electronic phases, including a high-pressure body-centered-cubic (bcc) structure with a maximum T_{\text{c}}=8.6\,K at 14.5 GPa. This suggests a universal behavior seen across the (\text{Bi}_{2})_{m}(\text{Bi}_{2}\text{Te}_{3})_{n} homologous series as well as in elemental Te [23, 24], Se [25], and Bi_{2}Se_{3}[26, 27].

## 2 Experiment

Single crystals of Bi_{2}Te were grown using the self-flux method. Elemental Bi and Te (99.999%, ESPI Metals) in a ratio of 12 at.% Te and 88 at.% Bi were combined in an alumina crucible and sealed under 500 mbars of high-purity argon gas in a quartz tube and melted at 420 degC for 2 days. The solution was then cooled to 318 degC over a period of 4 days at which point the quartz tube was removed from the oven and centrifuged to remove excess flux. Large platelets were removed and ground into a coarse powder using a mortar and pestle. The coarse powder was then placed on a glass slide and chopped with a razor blade into a fine powder for powder x-ray-diffraction characterization. These measurements confirmed that the lattice parameter is consistent with literature and that they were single phase Bi_{2}Te [13]. Additionally, we did not observe any peak-broadening effects that might be expected if there were any core-shell crystals indicating compositional gradients.

For structural studies under pressure we used a conventional membrane-driven diamond-anvil cell (DAC) with 300-\mum diamond culets. The powdered Bi_{2}Te, 3-5-\mum particle size, was loaded into a 130-\mum-diameter sample chamber that was drilled out of a rhenium gasket preindented to 25 GPa, corresponding to an initial thickness of 23 \mum. The chamber was also loaded with fine copper powder (3-6 \mum, Alfa Asar) as the pressure calibrant and neon, precompressed to 30 000 psi, as the pressure-transmitting medium. Room-temperature angle-dispersive x-ray-diffraction experiments were performed at HPCAT (beamline 16 BM-D) at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. The sample was illuminated with a 29.2-keV monochromatic x-ray beam, and angular-dispersive diffraction patterns were collected with a PerkinElmer detector using an exposure time of 10-20 s. The two-dimensional diffraction images were integrated using fit2d [28], then analyzed using the jade software package to extract crystal structure and volume information. To determine the pressure, we used the Vinet equation of state of the copper with fitting parameters for  the bulk modulus B_{0}=133 GPa and its pressure derivative B_{0}^{\prime}=5.01 from Dewaele _et al._[29].

For electrical transport studies under pressure we used an eight-probe designer DAC [30, 31] with 280-\mum-diameter cules, steatite as a pressure-transmitting medium, and ruby as the pressure calibrant [32, 33]. A MP35N metal gasket was preindented to an initial thickness of 60 \mum, and a 120-\mum hole was drilled in the center of the indentation for the sample chamber using an electric discharge machine. A small crystal of Bi_{2}Te with dimensions of 80-\mum diameter and 10-\mum thick was taken out of the larger micaceous crystallites and placed onto the designer anvil to ensure electrical contact with the tungsten leads exposed on the face of the designer diamond culet. Pressure was measured at room temperature on two separate ruby spheres within the sample chamber in order to estimate pressure distribution across the chamber. Based on previous studies using this type of DAC the error in the pressure at low temperatures was estimated to be 5% [31]. The temperature was measured using a calibrated Cernox thermometer affixed to the outside of the DAC. Electrical transport measurements were performed as a function of temperature and magnetic field using the ac transport option in the Quantum Design physical property measurement system.

## III Results

High-pressure x-ray-diffraction studies were performed on Bi_{2}Te powder in order to explore the universality of the collapse into the high-pressure bcc phase that occurs within the (Bi_{2})_{m}(Bi_{2}Te_{3})_{n} series. At ambient pressure and temperature the Bi_{2}Te starts out in the hexagonal phase with the _P_-_3m crystal structure, denoted as Bi_{2}Te-I, which persists up to 7 GPa. Upon compression near 5 GPa an intermediate phase begins to appear, denoted as Bi_{2}Te-II. Diffraction peaks belonging to this Bi_{2}Te-II phase are present in the diffraction patterns up to 17 GPa. However, at 9 GPa a second phase transition begins into the Bi_{2}Te-III that completes at 17 GPa. Integrated diffraction patterns for the three phases are shown in Fig. 1. Bi_{2}Te-II has a very broad pressure range where it coexists with either phase I or phase III but only a small 2 GPa window in which it is the only phase observed. Within this small window, we were unable to index the peaks to a structure with a pressure-volume dependence that was consistent with phases I and III. In contrast, the high-pressure Bi_{2}Te-III can easily be indexed to the bcc (_Im_-_3_m_) unit cell with a=3.747 A at P=8.8 GPa, and it is the stable phase at 47 GPa, the highest pressure attained in this study. Fitting the pressure-volume data points to the Vinet EOS [34, 35] for phase III we obtain V_{o}=29.88(0.27) A, B_{o}=54.2(5) GPa, and B^{\prime}=4.78(\pm 0.32). This Bi_{2}Te-III structure is best understood as a disordered substitutional alloy such that the bismuth and tellurium atoms reside randomly on the (2a) site of the bcc structure with occupancies defined by the 2:1 Bi:Te stoichiometry of the sample. This is believed to be due to the similar atomic radii of the two elements and is further enabled by charge transfer as a result of the application of high pressure. This behavior has also been seen in similar materials, such as (Bi,Sb)_{2}Te_{3} and Bi_{4}Te_{3}[20, 36, 37, 38]. Furthermore it seems that the unit-cell volume as a function of pressure for the bcc phase in Bi_{2}Te follows the same _P_-_V_ curve as do the above-mentioned two compounds [Fig. 2(a)]. We also note that, concomitant with the phase transformation from phase I to phase III, there is a volume collapse of approximately 9%. The fact that Bi_{2}Te also collapses into the bcc phase _strongly_ suggests that, despite having disparate ground-state phases, the entire (Bi_{2})_{m}(Bi_{2}Te_{3})_{n} series converges into the bcc phase at high pressures. These structural transformations are ubiquitous across this series, which suggests that there should also be concurrent transformations occurring in the electronic structure as well.

High-pressure magnetotransport measurements were performed to investigate the effects of the high-pressure structural phase transformations on the electronic structure of Bi_{2}Te. Hall resistance at 25 K as a function of applied magnetic field is shown in Fig. 3 for selected pressures. It can be seen that there is a clear change in the Hall resistance between 5.4 and 7.6 GPa, coincident with the phase transformation from the hexagonal phase (Bi_{2}Te-I) to the intermediate mixed phase (Bi_{2}Te-II) observed in x-ray diffraction. Although the structural and electronic phase transitions occur at nearly the same pressure, the difference in the two transition pressures could be attributed to the different pressure media used in the two experiments. The neon gas used in the diffraction measurements is considered hydrostatic up to about 10 GPa

Figure 1: X-ray-diffraction patterns at pressures within the hexagonal (_P_<5 GPa), intermediate (5 GPa <P<17 GPa) and body-centered-cubic phases (_P_>17 GPa). The _hkl_ indices of some of the diffraction reflections are shown for the hexagonal and bcc phases of Bi_{2}Te. The stars are the peaks from the copper pressure calibrant, and the arrows show the peaks due to the neon pressure medium.

  [39], whereas the steatite used in the magnetotransport measurements is a solid medium that can support small pressure gradients. Nonetheless, the fact that both phase diagrams agree as well as they do shows that the pressure medium is not affecting the structure or phase transformation mechanisms, although it is worth considering that it may be affecting some subtle electronic properties that are below the resolution of this study. The linearity of R_{xy} as a function of applied magnetic field suggests a dominant carrier type (Fig. 3) for all pressures at T = 25 K, but for pressures below 9.2 GPa a multiband picture of Bi_{2}Te emerges in the temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient (Fig. 4). At 2.8 GPa there is a crossover from a negative to a positive Hall coefficient near 70 K demonstrating a change in the dominant charge-carrier type. From our x-ray-diffraction measurements we know that Bi_{2}Te is in a mixed phase regime above 5 GPa, but as pressure is increased above 2.8 GPa the crossover temperature in the Hall sign decreases as does the magnitude of the Hall coefficient, suggesting a net increase in the carrier density as a function of pressure. In the mixed phase above 5.4 GPa there is very little change in the carrier concentration, compared to the concentration in the low-pressure hexagonal phase Bi_{2}Te-I. This can be clearly seen in Fig. 2(b) where the slope of the Hall resistance versus applied field R_{\rm H} and the longitudinal resistance R_{\rm xx} are plotted as a function of pressure. The Hall coefficient R_{\rm H}, as

Figure 4: Hall coefficient (linear fit to the data shown in Fig. 3) plotted as a function of temperature at increasing pressures shows the suppression of the carrier crossover from near 70 K at 2.8 GPa to 50 K at 5.4 GPa until it is nearly flat by 7.6 GPa with no visible change in carrier as a function of temperature. Although it is difficult to interpret these results given that the system is in the intermediate mixed phase region above 5 GPa, this figure shows that both temperature and pressure [Fig. 2(b)] affect the band structure of Bi_{2}Te and drive it from a semimetal to a metal via two separate tuning parameters.

Figure 3: Hall resistance at 25 K as a function of applied magnetic field for pressures between 5.4 and 32 GPa. There is a significant decrease in the Hall resistance above 5.4 GPa, which indicates a drastic change in the carrier concentration. Also, the change in the sign of the slope indicates that the majority carrier changes as pressure is increased, although the fact that R_{\rm xy} versus H remains linear up to 50 kOe suggests that there is a single dominant charge carrier for all of the pressures studied.

Figure 2: (a) Bi_{2}Te shows universal behavior in the high-pressure phase as it collapses into the bcc phase, just as the other members of the infinitely adaptive (Bi_{2})_{n}(Bi_{2}Te)_{n} series do. This result confirms this family of compounds with disparate electronic and crystal structure ground states can be tuned by the application of pressure to elicit a universal metallic superconducting phase with the body-centered-cubic crystal structure. (b) The electronic phase transitions that accompany the structural transitions are seen in the semimetal to metal crossover near 5 GPa as well as the change in charge-carrier type between 10 and 14 GPa. R_{\rm H} is given as the slope of the Hall resistance R_{\rm xy} versus the applied magnetic field (Fig. 3). (c) T_{\rm c} as a function of pressure for Bi_{2}Te plotted with the other members of the homologous family showing similar trends for peaks of T_{\rm c} before entering the bcc phase. (The inset) T_{\rm c} normalized to maximum T_{\rm c} in the bcc phase to show the same relation of slope for T_{\rm c} versus pressure in the bcc phase for the entire (Bi_{2})_{n}(Bi_{2}Te_{3})_{n} series.

  defined above as the slope of the Hall resistance as a function of applied magnetic field, is inversely proportional to the carrier density and, if the carrier concentrations are calculated using a single band model, there is an increase in carrier concentration within order of magnitude from \sim10^{21} cm^{-3} at 2.8 GPa--more typical of a semimetal--to \sim10^{23} cm^{-3} for pressures of 6.4 GPa and above--more characteristic of a typical metal. Considered within the single band model, this suggests that there is a metallization of Bi_{2}Te at these higher pressures and there should now be more electrons available to form superconducting pairs as has been seen in many of the other members of the (Bi_{2})_{m}(Bi_{2}Te_{3})_{n} series [17, 18, 20].

Low-temperature high-pressure transport data (Fig. 5) show the onset of superconductivity at 11.5 GPa. Although Bi_{2}Te did not fully enter the superconducting state by our minimum temperature of 1.8 K, we can extrapolate that the midpoint of the transition should have a T_{\rm c}\cong 2.1 K (see Fig. 5). At the next pressure of P=12.9 GPa, there are two transitions visible as it enters the superconducting state. This correlates with the fact that the system is in the intermediate Bi_{2}Te-II and Bi_{2}Te-III mixed phase with a different T_{\rm c}'s for the two states [see Fig. 2(c)]. T_{\rm c} increases sharply between 11.5 and 12.9 GPa for both transitions with T_{\rm c,II}=5.8 and T_{\rm c,III}=7.7 K. Once the pressure is increased to P=14.5 GPa there is a single sharp superconducting transition, which gives the maximum T_{\rm c}=8.6 K with a transition width of only 0.57 K. Although from the x-ray-diffraction data we know that Bi_{2}Te is still in the mixed phase at P=14.5 GPa, the superconducting transition seems dominated by the Bi_{2}Te-III (bcc) phase and has a T_{\rm c} similar to the maximum T_{\rm c} of Bi[17], Bi_{4}Te_{2}[20] (both 8.4 K), and Bi_{2}Te_{3}[18] (9.3 K) under pressure, all of which transform into a high-pressure bcc phase. After reaching its maximum, T_{\rm c} decreases monotonically down to T_{\rm c}=4.9 K at 32 GPa.

The universality of the superconducting state of the (Bi_{2})_{m}(Bi_{2}Te_{3})_{n} series in the high-pressure bcc phase can be seen more clearly by plotting the reduced critical temperature T_{\rm c}/T_{\rm c,\,max} versus P/P_{\rm c,\,max}, where P_{\rm c,\,max} is the pressure where T=T_{\rm c,\,max}, as is shown in the Fig. 2(c) inset. This shows the linear trend common to the series as T_{\rm c} is suppressed by increasing pressure after reaching T_{\rm c,\,max} at a rate of dT_{\rm c}/dP=-0.34\pm 0.02 K GPa. The linear suppression of T_{\rm c} is consistent with BCS-type phonon-mediated superconductivity in Bi_{2}Te in which pressure raises the average phonon frequency and reduces the electron-phonon coupling, thus decreasing the pairing mechanism strength [40, 41]. To further investigate the nature of the superconducting state using a treatment consistent with a BCS superconducting state, we can look at the electron-phonon coupling through the McMillan formula to find the volume Gruniesen parameter and compare it with other BCS superconductors.

The McMillan formula is given as T_{\rm c}=(\langle\omega\rangle/1.2)\exp[[-1.04(1+\lambda)]/[\lambda-\mu^{*}( 1+0.62\lambda)]], valid in the strong-coupling regime (\lambda\leqslant 1.5) and connects T_{\rm c} with the electron-phonon coupling parameter \lambda, an average phonon frequency \langle\omega\rangle, and the screened Coulomb repulsion \mu^{*} (taken here to be 0.1) [42]. By taking the logarithmic volume derivative of T_{\rm c}, we get the relation,

\[\frac{d\,\ln\,T_{\rm c}}{d\,\ln\,V}=-\gamma\,+\,\Delta\left\{\frac{d\,\ln\, \eta}{d\,\ln\,V}+2\gamma\right\},\]

in which \gamma=-d\ln\langle\omega\rangle/d\,\ln\,V is the Gruneisen parameter, \eta=N(E_{f})(I^{2}) is the Hopfield parameter, which is given by the product of the electronic density of states and the average-squared electronic matrix element, and \Delta=1.04\lambda[1+0.38\mu^{*}]/[\lambda-\mu^{*}(1+0.62\lambda)]^{2}[43]. Although the average phonon frequency \langle\omega\rangle has not been determined experimentally for Bi_{2}Te at high pressures, we can test a range of values of 100, 200, and 300 K that cover the range of the typical values. We choose P=14.5 GPa, where T_{\rm c} is a maximum at 8.6 K, to look at these values. Substituting T_{\rm c}=8.6, \langle\omega\rangle=100 K, and \mu^{*}=0.1 into the McMillan equation and solving for \lambda, we find \lambda=1.17. We can then substitute this value into the equation for \Delta, which gives a value of \Delta=1.28. All of these values can then be substituted into the above equation to find \gamma. We can extract the value of d\,\ln\,T_{\rm c}/d\,\ln\,V from our experimental data by combining our equation of state data [Fig. 4(a)] with the superconducting phase diagram [Fig. 4(c)]. If we plot \ln\,T_{\rm c} versus \ln\,V and take the derivative near P=14.5 GPa, we find a value of d\,\ln\,T_{\rm c}/d\,\ln\,V=5.55 K\AA^{3}. Substituting this value into the above equation for \gamma, along with our value of \Delta, and taking the value of d\,\ln\,\eta/d\,\ln\,V=-1[44], assuming again that Bi_{2}Te behaves like a simple p-electron metal, we are able to extract a value of \gamma=4.38. To test the parameters of this calculation we can vary the value of \langle\omega\rangle=200 and 300 K, which gives values of \gamma=2.3 and 1.9, respectively, closer to that of tin (Sn) (\gamma\approx+2.1) [45]. While yielding a \gamma value closer to that expected for simple metals, such as Sn, \langle\omega\rangle=200 or 300 K are substantially higher values than that of Sn (\langle\omega\rangle\approx 110 K) [42]. Given the strong compression of the lattice at the pressures where superconductivity is observed, it is likely that there is commensurate phonon stiffening, which would serve to increase \langle\omega\rangle. In light of this potential phonon stiffening, a value of \langle\omega\rangle=200 K does not seem unreasonable, and therefore the associated \gamma may be a reasonable estimate. Even with uncertainties in \langle\omega\rangle, the \gamma values calculated for Bi_{2}Te suggest that it behaves like a simple BCS-type phonon-mediated superconductor in the high-pressure bcc phase. Future experiments studying

Figure 5: Resistance as a function of temperature for pressures from 11.5 to 32 GPa showing the onset and subsequent suppression of the superconducting state in Bi_{2}Te. The resistance is normalized to the value of the resistance at 10 K for each particular pressure just to emphasize the change in T_{\rm c} as a function of pressure.

  the high-pressure phonon dispersions in Bi_{2}Te are needed to determine the actual value of \langle\omega\rangle and thereby more accurately determine the nature of the superconducting state in Bi_{2}Te and possibly the rest of the homologous series.

To investigate the pair-breaking mechanism in greater detail we applied magnetic fields to study how the superconducting state is suppressed as a function of pressure and magnetic field. This is shown for a single pressure of P=14.5 GPa for applied fields up to 30 kOe (Fig. 6) but was performed at all of the pressures in order to understand the pressure evolution of the superconducting state. Figure 7 shows the rate of suppression of T_{\rm c} with the applied magnetic field at all pressures up to 32.0 GPa. T_{\rm c} is defined as the midpoint of the superconducting transition and is only needed to be estimated for the highest applied magnetic fields, except at P=28.7 GPa. The estimated superconducting transition temperatures for the extrapolated data were based on a linear extrapolation of the resistance versus temperature curve for temperatures where T_{\rm midpoint}<T_{\rm final}<T_{\rm onset}. The rate of suppression is quasilinear at all pressures down to the lowest temperatures measured. This quasilinear trend of H_{\rm c2}(T) has also been observed in Bi_{4}Te_{3}[20], Bi_{2}Se_{3}[26], Cu_{x}Bi_{2}Te_{3}[46], YPtBi [47, 48], and ErPdBi [49]. Considering that all of these materials contain bismuth, these results suggest that strong spin-orbit scattering is the dominant pair-breaking mechanism in these materials.

As a starting point to analyze superconductivity in Bi_{2}Te we begin by assuming that it is a conventional superconductor. This is supported by the linear suppression of T_{\rm c} as a function of pressure in Bi_{2}Te [42]. In fact, the canonical model for this analysis, developed by Werthamer, Helfand and Hohenberg (WHH) [50], was originally applied to a Ti-Nb alloy with a bcc structure, similar to that of Bi_{2}Te, and contains a parameter which incorporates spin-orbit effects, which are germane to any modeling of Bi-containing systems. Within the WHH model for orbitally limited superconductors we can calculate the upper critical field at P=14.5 GPa as H_{\rm c2}(0)=-0.7T_{\rm c}\times dH_{\rm c2}/dT|_{T=T_{\rm c}}=1.94 T where T_{\rm c}(H=0)=8.66 K is taken at the midpoint of the superconducting transition, and dH_{\rm c2}/dH_{\rm c2}=-0.321 T K. This is lower than the measured H_{\rm c2}(2\,K)=2.12 T, suggesting that there is another mechanism involved in the superconducting pair breaking. If H_{\rm c2} is Pauli limited, then the superconducting gap energy \Delta is equal to the Zeeman energy and therefore the Pauli limiting field H_{\rm P}=1.84T_{\rm c}=15.93 T at P=14.5 GPa. Since the measured H_{\rm c2} is higher than the orbital limit but significantly lower than H_{\rm P}, we can assume that both orbital and Pauli limiting effects are in play with the orbital mechanism being the dominant one. To incorporate both mechanisms into our calculations of H_{\rm c2}, we can recalculate H_{\rm c2} using the modified formula, which includes the Maki parameter \alpha=\sqrt{2}H_{\rm c2}^{\rm orb}/H_{\rm P}[51] so that H_{\rm c2}^{\alpha}=H_{\rm c2}^{\rm orb}/\sqrt{(1+\alpha^{2})}=1.79 T at P=14.5 GPa, where \alpha=0.172., H_{\rm c2}^{\rm orb}=1.94 T, and H_{\rm P}=15.93 T. Including the Maki parameter only lowers the calculated H_{\rm c2}(T), providing further evidence that the pair breaking in Bi_{2}Te is driven by spin-orbit scattering and not Pauli spin paramagnetism.

To compare our results within the WHH theory for spin-singlet superconductors we plot the normalized critical field h^{*}(t)=(H_{\rm c2}/T_{\rm c})/|dH_{\rm c2}/dT|_{t=1} as a function of the normalized temperature t=T/T_{\rm c} for selected pressures up to 32 GPa (Fig. 8). The error bars in Fig. 8 are determined by propagating the individual uncertainties (e.g., \Delta T_{\rm c}) in the parameters defining h^{*} and t. Since we define T_{\rm c} as the midpoint of the superconducting transition, the error in T_{\rm c} is defined as the accuracy of the measurement of the resistance at T_{\rm c}, where \Delta R/R is \pm 1%. Given that the temperature is accurate to \pm 1%, we take whichever is the larger of the two as the error in T_{\rm c}. Due to trapped magnetic flux within the magnet, there is an uncertainty in the applied field of 0.1 kOe: \Delta H_{\rm c2}=0.1 kOe. The error in |dH_{\rm c2}/dT|_{t=1} is defined from the standard deviation returned from linear fits to the data near t=1. Because the critical field curves exhibit strong linearity, the slope near t=1 can be determined with an error below 2%.

All of the pressures follow the same h^{*}(t) slope and remain linear down to the lowest temperatures measured at t\sim 0.3. Based on the strong spin-orbit effects of Bi-based materials, we assumed that spin-orbit scattering was the main contributor to the pair-breaking mechanisms in Bi_{2}Te and therefore we include spin-orbit effects (\lambda_{\rm so}) within the WHH formalism in a similar fashion to Ref. [52] and compare

  them to our experimental results (Fig. 8): The blue dashed line is the WHH in the dirty limit (\alpha=0); the red dashed line includes a value of \alpha=0.2 (close to our experimental value of 0.172 calculated for P=14.5 GPa) and \lambda_{\rm so}=0; and the black dashed line includes \alpha=0.2 and an unphysically large \lambda_{\rm so}=100. The addition of \alpha=0.2 shifts the h^{\star}(t) curve down only slightly and only for t\leqslant 0.3. Because \alpha is so small in Bi_{2}Te, increasing \lambda_{\rm so} barely shifts the h^{\star}(t) curve up even for \lambda_{\rm so}=100, a spin-orbit scattering strength, which is well outside the limits of WHH. Considering that our data deviate from all of these models below t\sim 0.5, it is clear that a theory which includes very strong spin-orbit interactions must be developed to deal with this and similar spin-orbit-driven superconductors as attested to by a growing body of experimental work [26, 46, 48, 53].

In conclusion, we have found that Bi_{2}Te provides further evidence of a universal behavior of the series to collapse into the bcc structure at high pressures. Although Bi_{2}Te enters a high-pressure mixed phase region between roughly 5 and 17 GPa, we were able to observe a semimetal-metal transition near 5.4 GPa in both linear and Hall resistance measurements. We were able to establish that there is a dominant carrier type below 5.4 GPa via magnetic-field and temperature-dependence measurements, although it was difficult to unambiguously determine carrier type and concentration in the mixed phase. We also discovered pressure-induced superconductivity in Bi_{2}Te with a maximum T_{\rm c}=8.66 K at P=14.5 GPa. Bi_{2}Te has a similar maximum T_{\rm c} (\sim8 K) to other materials in the (Bi_{2})_{m}(Bi_{2}Te_{3})_{n} series as well as a similar rate of suppression of T_{\rm c} with pressure. Analysis of the pressure dependence of the superconducting state suggests that Bi_{2}Te is likely a conventional BCS superconductor, but the linear suppression of T_{\rm c} with the field implies unconventional and strong spin-orbit scattering pair-breaking effects. This pair breaking is outside of the scope of the conventional WHH theory and requires a new treatment that is able to incorporate strong spin-orbit scattering. Although establishing whether Bi_{2}Te has topologically nontrivial surface states is outside the scope of this paper, as a member of the homologous series (A_{2})_{n}(A_{2}B_{3})_{m} where A= Bi,Sb,Pb,Ge and B= Te,Se,S, many permutations and dopings of these and similar materials [14, 15, 46, 54, 55, 56] have produced TIs. It would be of great interest if future work could confirm whether Bi_{2}Te is a TI via theoretical calculations as well as experimental techniques, such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, or quantum oscillations. This would help to confirm the universality of the infinitely adaptive (Bi_{2})_{m}(Bi_{2}Te_{3})_{n} series, not only with regard to the superconducting state and high-pressure crystal structure, but also in the topological nature of these materials.

Figure 8: Graph showing the renormalized H_{\rm c2}(T) for selected pressures using the reduced temperature T/T_{\rm c} and the reduced critical field (see the text) in order to compare with theory. The fitting is performed using the classical WHH model in which the blue dashed line is the limit of the Maki parameter, \alpha=0 and the spin-orbit scattering strength \lambda_{\rm so}=0. To compare our data with the WHH model we used \alpha=0.2 and varied \lambda_{\rm so} to see the effect of spin-orbit scattering. As is shown in the figure, due to the fact that \alpha is so small, even with values of \lambda_{\rm so} up to 100 (well outside of WHH conditions) our data begins to deviate from the models for t<0.7. The error bars are propagated from uncertainties in the measured quantities (see the text).

###### Abstract

Using high-pressure magnetotransport techniques we have discovered superconductivity in Bi_{2}Te, a member of the infinitely adaptive \mathbf{(Bi_{2})_{m}(Bi_{2}Te_{3})_{n}} series, whose end members, Bi and Bi_{1}Te_{8}, can be tuned to display topological surface states or superconductivity. Bi_{2}Te has a maximum T_{\text{c}}=8.6\,K at P=14.5\,GPa and goes through multiple high-pressure phase transitions, ultimately collapsing into a bcc structure that suggests a universal behavior across the series. High-pressure magnetoresistance and Hall measurements suggest a semimetal to metal transition near 5.4 GPa, which accompanies the hexagonal to intermediate phase transition seen via x-ray diffraction measurements. In addition, the linearity of H_{\text{c2}}(T) exceeds the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg limit, even in the extreme spin-orbit scattering limit, yet is consistent with other strong spin-orbit materials. Considering these results in combination with similar reports on strong spin-orbit scattering materials seen in the literature, we suggest the need for a new theory that can address the unconventional nature of their superconducting states.

## 1 Introduction

The past several years have seen a large volume of research dedicated to materials whose properties are driven by the topology of their quantum states [1]. These states realize long theorized exotic quantum-mechanical effects, such as Weyl fermions, predicted nearly a century ago [2,3], and others, such as topological insulators (TIs) and topological superconductors, predicted only a few years ago [4,5]. One of the more exciting prospects of TIs is that with proximity-induced superconductivity [6] they provide the Z_{2} nontrivial state allowing for promising applications in spintronics and quantum computation [7] as well as the experimental realization of Majorana fermions [8].

One of the key properties necessary for making a TI is strong spin-orbit coupling, first discovered in HgTe quantum wells and later found in several bismuth-based chalcogenides [9, 10, 11, 12]. A particularly interesting family of these materials is the infinitely adaptive series (A_{2})_{m}(A_{2}Q_{3})_{n} with A=(\text{Bi},\text{Sb}) and Q=(\text{Se},\text{Te}). Although members of this series are well known as some of the best thermoelectric materials, they were recently found to be topological insulators as well [13, 14, 15, 16]. In particular, the end members of the infinitely adaptive (\text{Bi}_{2})_{m}(\text{Bi}_{2}\text{Te}_{3})_{n} series, Bi and Bi_{2}Te_{3}, can be experimentally tuned to display topological surface states or superconductivity under appropriate conditions [11, 17, 18, 19].

In our search for functional materials that possess these exotic properties we synthesized and studied Bi_{2}Te, a member of the (\text{Bi}_{2})_{m}(\text{Bi}_{2}\text{Te}_{3})_{n} series, with m=2 and n=1. Containing a Bi fraction of 0.67, Bi_{2}Te is on the Bi-rich side of this series, which spans the spectrum from pure Bi (m=3:n=0) to Bi_{2}Te_{3} (m=0:n=3). Similar to other members of this series [20, 21, 22], Bi_{2}Te transforms from an ambient pressure semimetal to a high-pressure superconductor, progressing through multiple structural and electronic phases, including a high-pressure body-centered-cubic (bcc) structure with a maximum T_{\text{c}}=8.6\,K at 14.5 GPa. This suggests a universal behavior seen across the (\text{Bi}_{2})_{m}(\text{Bi}_{2}\text{Te}_{3})_{n} homologous series as well as in elemental Te [23, 24], Se [25], and Bi_{2}Se_{3}[26, 27].

## 2 Experiment

Single crystals of Bi_{2}Te were grown using the self-flux method. Elemental Bi and Te (99.999%, ESPI Metals) in a ratio of 12 at.% Te and 88 at.% Bi were combined in an alumina crucible and sealed under 500 mbars of high-purity argon gas in a quartz tube and melted at 420 degC for 2 days. The solution was then cooled to 318 degC over a period of 4 days at which point the quartz tube was removed from the oven and centrifuged to remove excess flux. Large platelets were removed and ground into a coarse powder using a mortar and pestle. The coarse powder was then placed on a glass slide and chopped with a razor blade into a fine powder for powder x-ray-diffraction characterization. These measurements confirmed that the lattice parameter is consistent with literature and that they were single phase Bi_{2}Te [13]. Additionally, we did not observe any peak-broadening effects that might be expected if there were any core-shell crystals indicating compositional gradients.

For structural studies under pressure we used a conventional membrane-driven diamond-anvil cell (DAC) with 300-\mum diamond culets. The powdered Bi_{2}Te, 3-5-\mum particle size, was loaded into a 130-\mum-diameter sample chamber that was drilled out of a rhenium gasket preindented to 25 GPa, corresponding to an initial thickness of 23 \mum. The chamber was also loaded with fine copper powder (3-6 \mum, Alfa Asar) as the pressure calibrant and neon, precompressed to 30 000 psi, as the pressure-transmitting medium. Room-temperature angle-dispersive x-ray-diffraction experiments were performed at HPCAT (beamline 16 BM-D) at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. The sample was illuminated with a 29.2-keV monochromatic x-ray beam, and angular-dispersive diffraction patterns were collected with a PerkinElmer detector using an exposure time of 10-20 s. The two-dimensional diffraction images were integrated using fit2d [28], then analyzed using the jade software package to extract crystal structure and volume information. To determine the pressure, we used the Vinet equation of state of the copper with fitting parameters for  the bulk modulus B_{0}=133 GPa and its pressure derivative B_{0}^{\prime}=5.01 from Dewaele _et al._[29].

For electrical transport studies under pressure we used an eight-probe designer DAC [30, 31] with 280-\mum-diameter cules, steatite as a pressure-transmitting medium, and ruby as the pressure calibrant [32, 33]. A MP35N metal gasket was preindented to an initial thickness of 60 \mum, and a 120-\mum hole was drilled in the center of the indentation for the sample chamber using an electric discharge machine. A small crystal of Bi_{2}Te with dimensions of 80-\mum diameter and 10-\mum thick was taken out of the larger micaceous crystallites and placed onto the designer anvil to ensure electrical contact with the tungsten leads exposed on the face of the designer diamond culet. Pressure was measured at room temperature on two separate ruby spheres within the sample chamber in order to estimate pressure distribution across the chamber. Based on previous studies using this type of DAC the error in the pressure at low temperatures was estimated to be 5% [31]. The temperature was measured using a calibrated Cernox thermometer affixed to the outside of the DAC. Electrical transport measurements were performed as a function of temperature and magnetic field using the ac transport option in the Quantum Design physical property measurement system.

## III Results

High-pressure x-ray-diffraction studies were performed on Bi_{2}Te powder in order to explore the universality of the collapse into the high-pressure bcc phase that occurs within the (Bi_{2})_{m}(Bi_{2}Te_{3})_{n} series. At ambient pressure and temperature the Bi_{2}Te starts out in the hexagonal phase with the _P_-_3m crystal structure, denoted as Bi_{2}Te-I, which persists up to 7 GPa. Upon compression near 5 GPa an intermediate phase begins to appear, denoted as Bi_{2}Te-II. Diffraction peaks belonging to this Bi_{2}Te-II phase are present in the diffraction patterns up to 17 GPa. However, at 9 GPa a second phase transition begins into the Bi_{2}Te-III that completes at 17 GPa. Integrated diffraction patterns for the three phases are shown in Fig. 1. Bi_{2}Te-II has a very broad pressure range where it coexists with either phase I or phase III but only a small 2 GPa window in which it is the only phase observed. Within this small window, we were unable to index the peaks to a structure with a pressure-volume dependence that was consistent with phases I and III. In contrast, the high-pressure Bi_{2}Te-III can easily be indexed to the bcc (_Im_-_3_m_) unit cell with a=3.747 A at P=8.8 GPa, and it is the stable phase at 47 GPa, the highest pressure attained in this study. Fitting the pressure-volume data points to the Vinet EOS [34, 35] for phase III we obtain V_{o}=29.88(0.27) A, B_{o}=54.2(5) GPa, and B^{\prime}=4.78(\pm 0.32). This Bi_{2}Te-III structure is best understood as a disordered substitutional alloy such that the bismuth and tellurium atoms reside randomly on the (2a) site of the bcc structure with occupancies defined by the 2:1 Bi:Te stoichiometry of the sample. This is believed to be due to the similar atomic radii of the two elements and is further enabled by charge transfer as a result of the application of high pressure. This behavior has also been seen in similar materials, such as (Bi,Sb)_{2}Te_{3} and Bi_{4}Te_{3}[20, 36, 37, 38]. Furthermore it seems that the unit-cell volume as a function of pressure for the bcc phase in Bi_{2}Te follows the same _P_-_V_ curve as do the above-mentioned two compounds [Fig. 2(a)]. We also note that, concomitant with the phase transformation from phase I to phase III, there is a volume collapse of approximately 9%. The fact that Bi_{2}Te also collapses into the bcc phase _strongly_ suggests that, despite having disparate ground-state phases, the entire (Bi_{2})_{m}(Bi_{2}Te_{3})_{n} series converges into the bcc phase at high pressures. These structural transformations are ubiquitous across this series, which suggests that there should also be concurrent transformations occurring in the electronic structure as well.

High-pressure magnetotransport measurements were performed to investigate the effects of the high-pressure structural phase transformations on the electronic structure of Bi_{2}Te. Hall resistance at 25 K as a function of applied magnetic field is shown in Fig. 3 for selected pressures. It can be seen that there is a clear change in the Hall resistance between 5.4 and 7.6 GPa, coincident with the phase transformation from the hexagonal phase (Bi_{2}Te-I) to the intermediate mixed phase (Bi_{2}Te-II) observed in x-ray diffraction. Although the structural and electronic phase transitions occur at nearly the same pressure, the difference in the two transition pressures could be attributed to the different pressure media used in the two experiments. The neon gas used in the diffraction measurements is considered hydrostatic up to about 10 GPa

Figure 1: X-ray-diffraction patterns at pressures within the hexagonal (_P_<5 GPa), intermediate (5 GPa <P<17 GPa) and body-centered-cubic phases (_P_>17 GPa). The _hkl_ indices of some of the diffraction reflections are shown for the hexagonal and bcc phases of Bi_{2}Te. The stars are the peaks from the copper pressure calibrant, and the arrows show the peaks due to the neon pressure medium.

  [39], whereas the steatite used in the magnetotransport measurements is a solid medium that can support small pressure gradients. Nonetheless, the fact that both phase diagrams agree as well as they do shows that the pressure medium is not affecting the structure or phase transformation mechanisms, although it is worth considering that it may be affecting some subtle electronic properties that are below the resolution of this study. The linearity of R_{xy} as a function of applied magnetic field suggests a dominant carrier type (Fig. 3) for all pressures at T = 25 K, but for pressures below 9.2 GPa a multiband picture of Bi_{2}Te emerges in the temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient (Fig. 4). At 2.8 GPa there is a crossover from a negative to a positive Hall coefficient near 70 K demonstrating a change in the dominant charge-carrier type. From our x-ray-diffraction measurements we know that Bi_{2}Te is in a mixed phase regime above 5 GPa, but as pressure is increased above 2.8 GPa the crossover temperature in the Hall sign decreases as does the magnitude of the Hall coefficient, suggesting a net increase in the carrier density as a function of pressure. In the mixed phase above 5.4 GPa there is very little change in the carrier concentration, compared to the concentration in the low-pressure hexagonal phase Bi_{2}Te-I. This can be clearly seen in Fig. 2(b) where the slope of the Hall resistance versus applied field R_{\rm H} and the longitudinal resistance R_{\rm xx} are plotted as a function of pressure. The Hall coefficient R_{\rm H}, as

Figure 4: Hall coefficient (linear fit to the data shown in Fig. 3) plotted as a function of temperature at increasing pressures shows the suppression of the carrier crossover from near 70 K at 2.8 GPa to 50 K at 5.4 GPa until it is nearly flat by 7.6 GPa with no visible change in carrier as a function of temperature. Although it is difficult to interpret these results given that the system is in the intermediate mixed phase region above 5 GPa, this figure shows that both temperature and pressure [Fig. 2(b)] affect the band structure of Bi_{2}Te and drive it from a semimetal to a metal via two separate tuning parameters.

Figure 3: Hall resistance at 25 K as a function of applied magnetic field for pressures between 5.4 and 32 GPa. There is a significant decrease in the Hall resistance above 5.4 GPa, which indicates a drastic change in the carrier concentration. Also, the change in the sign of the slope indicates that the majority carrier changes as pressure is increased, although the fact that R_{\rm xy} versus H remains linear up to 50 kOe suggests that there is a single dominant charge carrier for all of the pressures studied.

Figure 2: (a) Bi_{2}Te shows universal behavior in the high-pressure phase as it collapses into the bcc phase, just as the other members of the infinitely adaptive (Bi_{2})_{n}(Bi_{2}Te)_{n} series do. This result confirms this family of compounds with disparate electronic and crystal structure ground states can be tuned by the application of pressure to elicit a universal metallic superconducting phase with the body-centered-cubic crystal structure. (b) The electronic phase transitions that accompany the structural transitions are seen in the semimetal to metal crossover near 5 GPa as well as the change in charge-carrier type between 10 and 14 GPa. R_{\rm H} is given as the slope of the Hall resistance R_{\rm xy} versus the applied magnetic field (Fig. 3). (c) T_{\rm c} as a function of pressure for Bi_{2}Te plotted with the other members of the homologous family showing similar trends for peaks of T_{\rm c} before entering the bcc phase. (The inset) T_{\rm c} normalized to maximum T_{\rm c} in the bcc phase to show the same relation of slope for T_{\rm c} versus pressure in the bcc phase for the entire (Bi_{2})_{n}(Bi_{2}Te_{3})_{n} series.

  defined above as the slope of the Hall resistance as a function of applied magnetic field, is inversely proportional to the carrier density and, if the carrier concentrations are calculated using a single band model, there is an increase in carrier concentration within order of magnitude from \sim10^{21} cm^{-3} at 2.8 GPa--more typical of a semimetal--to \sim10^{23} cm^{-3} for pressures of 6.4 GPa and above--more characteristic of a typical metal. Considered within the single band model, this suggests that there is a metallization of Bi_{2}Te at these higher pressures and there should now be more electrons available to form superconducting pairs as has been seen in many of the other members of the (Bi_{2})_{m}(Bi_{2}Te_{3})_{n} series [17, 18, 20].

Low-temperature high-pressure transport data (Fig. 5) show the onset of superconductivity at 11.5 GPa. Although Bi_{2}Te did not fully enter the superconducting state by our minimum temperature of 1.8 K, we can extrapolate that the midpoint of the transition should have a T_{\rm c}\cong 2.1 K (see Fig. 5). At the next pressure of P=12.9 GPa, there are two transitions visible as it enters the superconducting state. This correlates with the fact that the system is in the intermediate Bi_{2}Te-II and Bi_{2}Te-III mixed phase with a different T_{\rm c}'s for the two states [see Fig. 2(c)]. T_{\rm c} increases sharply between 11.5 and 12.9 GPa for both transitions with T_{\rm c,II}=5.8 and T_{\rm c,III}=7.7 K. Once the pressure is increased to P=14.5 GPa there is a single sharp superconducting transition, which gives the maximum T_{\rm c}=8.6 K with a transition width of only 0.57 K. Although from the x-ray-diffraction data we know that Bi_{2}Te is still in the mixed phase at P=14.5 GPa, the superconducting transition seems dominated by the Bi_{2}Te-III (bcc) phase and has a T_{\rm c} similar to the maximum T_{\rm c} of Bi[17], Bi_{4}Te_{2}[20] (both 8.4 K), and Bi_{2}Te_{3}[18] (9.3 K) under pressure, all of which transform into a high-pressure bcc phase. After reaching its maximum, T_{\rm c} decreases monotonically down to T_{\rm c}=4.9 K at 32 GPa.

The universality of the superconducting state of the (Bi_{2})_{m}(Bi_{2}Te_{3})_{n} series in the high-pressure bcc phase can be seen more clearly by plotting the reduced critical temperature T_{\rm c}/T_{\rm c,\,max} versus P/P_{\rm c,\,max}, where P_{\rm c,\,max} is the pressure where T=T_{\rm c,\,max}, as is shown in the Fig. 2(c) inset. This shows the linear trend common to the series as T_{\rm c} is suppressed by increasing pressure after reaching T_{\rm c,\,max} at a rate of dT_{\rm c}/dP=-0.34\pm 0.02 K GPa. The linear suppression of T_{\rm c} is consistent with BCS-type phonon-mediated superconductivity in Bi_{2}Te in which pressure raises the average phonon frequency and reduces the electron-phonon coupling, thus decreasing the pairing mechanism strength [40, 41]. To further investigate the nature of the superconducting state using a treatment consistent with a BCS superconducting state, we can look at the electron-phonon coupling through the McMillan formula to find the volume Gruniesen parameter and compare it with other BCS superconductors.

The McMillan formula is given as T_{\rm c}=(\langle\omega\rangle/1.2)\exp[[-1.04(1+\lambda)]/[\lambda-\mu^{*}( 1+0.62\lambda)]], valid in the strong-coupling regime (\lambda\leqslant 1.5) and connects T_{\rm c} with the electron-phonon coupling parameter \lambda, an average phonon frequency \langle\omega\rangle, and the screened Coulomb repulsion \mu^{*} (taken here to be 0.1) [42]. By taking the logarithmic volume derivative of T_{\rm c}, we get the relation,

\[\frac{d\,\ln\,T_{\rm c}}{d\,\ln\,V}=-\gamma\,+\,\Delta\left\{\frac{d\,\ln\, \eta}{d\,\ln\,V}+2\gamma\right\},\]

in which \gamma=-d\ln\langle\omega\rangle/d\,\ln\,V is the Gruneisen parameter, \eta=N(E_{f})(I^{2}) is the Hopfield parameter, which is given by the product of the electronic density of states and the average-squared electronic matrix element, and \Delta=1.04\lambda[1+0.38\mu^{*}]/[\lambda-\mu^{*}(1+0.62\lambda)]^{2}[43]. Although the average phonon frequency \langle\omega\rangle has not been determined experimentally for Bi_{2}Te at high pressures, we can test a range of values of 100, 200, and 300 K that cover the range of the typical values. We choose P=14.5 GPa, where T_{\rm c} is a maximum at 8.6 K, to look at these values. Substituting T_{\rm c}=8.6, \langle\omega\rangle=100 K, and \mu^{*}=0.1 into the McMillan equation and solving for \lambda, we find \lambda=1.17. We can then substitute this value into the equation for \Delta, which gives a value of \Delta=1.28. All of these values can then be substituted into the above equation to find \gamma. We can extract the value of d\,\ln\,T_{\rm c}/d\,\ln\,V from our experimental data by combining our equation of state data [Fig. 4(a)] with the superconducting phase diagram [Fig. 4(c)]. If we plot \ln\,T_{\rm c} versus \ln\,V and take the derivative near P=14.5 GPa, we find a value of d\,\ln\,T_{\rm c}/d\,\ln\,V=5.55 K\AA^{3}. Substituting this value into the above equation for \gamma, along with our value of \Delta, and taking the value of d\,\ln\,\eta/d\,\ln\,V=-1[44], assuming again that Bi_{2}Te behaves like a simple p-electron metal, we are able to extract a value of \gamma=4.38. To test the parameters of this calculation we can vary the value of \langle\omega\rangle=200 and 300 K, which gives values of \gamma=2.3 and 1.9, respectively, closer to that of tin (Sn) (\gamma\approx+2.1) [45]. While yielding a \gamma value closer to that expected for simple metals, such as Sn, \langle\omega\rangle=200 or 300 K are substantially higher values than that of Sn (\langle\omega\rangle\approx 110 K) [42]. Given the strong compression of the lattice at the pressures where superconductivity is observed, it is likely that there is commensurate phonon stiffening, which would serve to increase \langle\omega\rangle. In light of this potential phonon stiffening, a value of \langle\omega\rangle=200 K does not seem unreasonable, and therefore the associated \gamma may be a reasonable estimate. Even with uncertainties in \langle\omega\rangle, the \gamma values calculated for Bi_{2}Te suggest that it behaves like a simple BCS-type phonon-mediated superconductor in the high-pressure bcc phase. Future experiments studying

Figure 5: Resistance as a function of temperature for pressures from 11.5 to 32 GPa showing the onset and subsequent suppression of the superconducting state in Bi_{2}Te. The resistance is normalized to the value of the resistance at 10 K for each particular pressure just to emphasize the change in T_{\rm c} as a function of pressure.

  the high-pressure phonon dispersions in Bi_{2}Te are needed to determine the actual value of \langle\omega\rangle and thereby more accurately determine the nature of the superconducting state in Bi_{2}Te and possibly the rest of the homologous series.

To investigate the pair-breaking mechanism in greater detail we applied magnetic fields to study how the superconducting state is suppressed as a function of pressure and magnetic field. This is shown for a single pressure of P=14.5 GPa for applied fields up to 30 kOe (Fig. 6) but was performed at all of the pressures in order to understand the pressure evolution of the superconducting state. Figure 7 shows the rate of suppression of T_{\rm c} with the applied magnetic field at all pressures up to 32.0 GPa. T_{\rm c} is defined as the midpoint of the superconducting transition and is only needed to be estimated for the highest applied magnetic fields, except at P=28.7 GPa. The estimated superconducting transition temperatures for the extrapolated data were based on a linear extrapolation of the resistance versus temperature curve for temperatures where T_{\rm midpoint}<T_{\rm final}<T_{\rm onset}. The rate of suppression is quasilinear at all pressures down to the lowest temperatures measured. This quasilinear trend of H_{\rm c2}(T) has also been observed in Bi_{4}Te_{3}[20], Bi_{2}Se_{3}[26], Cu_{x}Bi_{2}Te_{3}[46], YPtBi [47, 48], and ErPdBi [49]. Considering that all of these materials contain bismuth, these results suggest that strong spin-orbit scattering is the dominant pair-breaking mechanism in these materials.

As a starting point to analyze superconductivity in Bi_{2}Te we begin by assuming that it is a conventional superconductor. This is supported by the linear suppression of T_{\rm c} as a function of pressure in Bi_{2}Te [42]. In fact, the canonical model for this analysis, developed by Werthamer, Helfand and Hohenberg (WHH) [50], was originally applied to a Ti-Nb alloy with a bcc structure, similar to that of Bi_{2}Te, and contains a parameter which incorporates spin-orbit effects, which are germane to any modeling of Bi-containing systems. Within the WHH model for orbitally limited superconductors we can calculate the upper critical field at P=14.5 GPa as H_{\rm c2}(0)=-0.7T_{\rm c}\times dH_{\rm c2}/dT|_{T=T_{\rm c}}=1.94 T where T_{\rm c}(H=0)=8.66 K is taken at the midpoint of the superconducting transition, and dH_{\rm c2}/dH_{\rm c2}=-0.321 T K. This is lower than the measured H_{\rm c2}(2\,K)=2.12 T, suggesting that there is another mechanism involved in the superconducting pair breaking. If H_{\rm c2} is Pauli limited, then the superconducting gap energy \Delta is equal to the Zeeman energy and therefore the Pauli limiting field H_{\rm P}=1.84T_{\rm c}=15.93 T at P=14.5 GPa. Since the measured H_{\rm c2} is higher than the orbital limit but significantly lower than H_{\rm P}, we can assume that both orbital and Pauli limiting effects are in play with the orbital mechanism being the dominant one. To incorporate both mechanisms into our calculations of H_{\rm c2}, we can recalculate H_{\rm c2} using the modified formula, which includes the Maki parameter \alpha=\sqrt{2}H_{\rm c2}^{\rm orb}/H_{\rm P}[51] so that H_{\rm c2}^{\alpha}=H_{\rm c2}^{\rm orb}/\sqrt{(1+\alpha^{2})}=1.79 T at P=14.5 GPa, where \alpha=0.172., H_{\rm c2}^{\rm orb}=1.94 T, and H_{\rm P}=15.93 T. Including the Maki parameter only lowers the calculated H_{\rm c2}(T), providing further evidence that the pair breaking in Bi_{2}Te is driven by spin-orbit scattering and not Pauli spin paramagnetism.

To compare our results within the WHH theory for spin-singlet superconductors we plot the normalized critical field h^{*}(t)=(H_{\rm c2}/T_{\rm c})/|dH_{\rm c2}/dT|_{t=1} as a function of the normalized temperature t=T/T_{\rm c} for selected pressures up to 32 GPa (Fig. 8). The error bars in Fig. 8 are determined by propagating the individual uncertainties (e.g., \Delta T_{\rm c}) in the parameters defining h^{*} and t. Since we define T_{\rm c} as the midpoint of the superconducting transition, the error in T_{\rm c} is defined as the accuracy of the measurement of the resistance at T_{\rm c}, where \Delta R/R is \pm 1%. Given that the temperature is accurate to \pm 1%, we take whichever is the larger of the two as the error in T_{\rm c}. Due to trapped magnetic flux within the magnet, there is an uncertainty in the applied field of 0.1 kOe: \Delta H_{\rm c2}=0.1 kOe. The error in |dH_{\rm c2}/dT|_{t=1} is defined from the standard deviation returned from linear fits to the data near t=1. Because the critical field curves exhibit strong linearity, the slope near t=1 can be determined with an error below 2%.

All of the pressures follow the same h^{*}(t) slope and remain linear down to the lowest temperatures measured at t\sim 0.3. Based on the strong spin-orbit effects of Bi-based materials, we assumed that spin-orbit scattering was the main contributor to the pair-breaking mechanisms in Bi_{2}Te and therefore we include spin-orbit effects (\lambda_{\rm so}) within the WHH formalism in a similar fashion to Ref. [52] and compare

Figure 6: Suppression of the superconducting transition with magnetic field at P=14.5 GPa shown in plots of resistance as a function of temperature. The linear trend of dT_{\rm c}/dH can be more clearly seen in the phase diagram shown in Fig. 7.

Figure 7: H_{\rm c} is suppressed linearly with temperature for all of the pressures studied. T_{\rm c} is taken to be the midpoint of the superconducting transition. The error bars are smaller than the marker size (see the text).

  them to our experimental results (Fig. 8): The blue dashed line is the WHH in the dirty limit (\alpha=0); the red dashed line includes a value of \alpha=0.2 (close to our experimental value of 0.172 calculated for P=14.5 GPa) and \lambda_{\rm so}=0; and the black dashed line includes \alpha=0.2 and an unphysically large \lambda_{\rm so}=100. The addition of \alpha=0.2 shifts the h^{\star}(t) curve down only slightly and only for t\leqslant 0.3. Because \alpha is so small in Bi_{2}Te, increasing \lambda_{\rm so} barely shifts the h^{\star}(t) curve up even for \lambda_{\rm so}=100, a spin-orbit scattering strength, which is well outside the limits of WHH. Considering that our data deviate from all of these models below t\sim 0.5, it is clear that a theory which includes very strong spin-orbit interactions must be developed to deal with this and similar spin-orbit-driven superconductors as attested to by a growing body of experimental work [26, 46, 48, 53].

In conclusion, we have found that Bi_{2}Te provides further evidence of a universal behavior of the series to collapse into the bcc structure at high pressures. Although Bi_{2}Te enters a high-pressure mixed phase region between roughly 5 and 17 GPa, we were able to observe a semimetal-metal transition near 5.4 GPa in both linear and Hall resistance measurements. We were able to establish that there is a dominant carrier type below 5.4 GPa via magnetic-field and temperature-dependence measurements, although it was difficult to unambiguously determine carrier type and concentration in the mixed phase. We also discovered pressure-induced superconductivity in Bi_{2}Te with a maximum T_{\rm c}=8.66 K at P=14.5 GPa. Bi_{2}Te has a similar maximum T_{\rm c} (\sim8 K) to other materials in the (Bi_{2})_{m}(Bi_{2}Te_{3})_{n} series as well as a similar rate of suppression of T_{\rm c} with pressure. Analysis of the pressure dependence of the superconducting state suggests that Bi_{2}Te is likely a conventional BCS superconductor, but the linear suppression of T_{\rm c} with the field implies unconventional and strong spin-orbit scattering pair-breaking effects. This pair breaking is outside of the scope of the conventional WHH theory and requires a new treatment that is able to incorporate strong spin-orbit scattering. Although establishing whether Bi_{2}Te has topologically nontrivial surface states is outside the scope of this paper, as a member of the homologous series (A_{2})_{n}(A_{2}B_{3})_{m} where A= Bi,Sb,Pb,Ge and B= Te,Se,S, many permutations and dopings of these and similar materials [14, 15, 46, 54, 55, 56] have produced TIs. It would be of great interest if future work could confirm whether Bi_{2}Te is a TI via theoretical calculations as well as experimental techniques, such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, or quantum oscillations. This would help to confirm the universality of the infinitely adaptive (Bi_{2})_{m}(Bi_{2}Te_{3})_{n} series, not only with regard to the superconducting state and high-pressure crystal structure, but also in the topological nature of these materials.

Figure 8: Graph showing the renormalized H_{\rm c2}(T) for selected pressures using the reduced temperature T/T_{\rm c} and the reduced critical field (see the text) in order to compare with theory. The fitting is performed using the classical WHH model in which the blue dashed line is the limit of the Maki parameter, \alpha=0 and the spin-orbit scattering strength \lambda_{\rm so}=0. To compare our data with the WHH model we used \alpha=0.2 and varied \lambda_{\rm so} to see the effect of spin-orbit scattering. As is shown in the figure, due to the fact that \alpha is so small, even with values of \lambda_{\rm so} up to 100 (well outside of WHH conditions) our data begins to deviate from the models for t<0.7. The error bars are propagated from uncertainties in the measured quantities (see the text).
