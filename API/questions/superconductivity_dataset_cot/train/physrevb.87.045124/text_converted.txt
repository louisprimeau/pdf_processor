J. M. McQueen powders intimately mixed with a Si internal standard on a
laboratory x-ray diffractometer; the reported uncertainty of the x-ray
wavelength has been propagated in quadrature. SXRD were collected from
polycrystalline powders sealed in an evacuated fused silica capillary
backfilled with p_(He) = 10 torr. Data for T ≤ 100 K were collected
using a He cryostat (Oxford Instruments); data collected at T ≥ 100 K
were collected using a nitrogen cryostream. Rietveld analyses were
performed using GSAS/EXPGUL.[17, 18] The synchrotron x-ray diffraction
(SXRD) data revealed the presence of 3 wt

Neutron total scattering data were collected at temperatures between 5 K
and 300 K on polycrystalline KNi₂S₂ (loaded in a vanadium can with a He
atmosphere) using the time-of-flight HIPD and NPDF instruments at the
Lujan Center, Los Alamos Neutron Science Center, Los Alamos National
Laboratory. PDF analysis was performed on the total neutron scattering
data and G(r) were extracted with Q_(max) = 29 A⁻¹ (HIPD) and
Q_(max) = 35 A⁻¹ (NPDF) using PDFgetN.[19] Least-squares fits to the PDF
were performed using PDFgui.[20] Reverse Monte Carlo simulations of
20 × 20 × 6 superecils (24 000 atoms, ∼75 A/side) were performed using
RMCprofile,[21] while applying a small penalty for breaking tetrahedral
coordination and a hard-sphere cutoff for the Ni-S bond distance. The
structural parameters (Ni-Ni distance and bond valence sums) were
compiled from the average of four independent simulations. Atomistic
visualization was accomplished using VESTA.[22]

Physical properties were measured using a Physical Properties
Measurement System, Quantum Design, Inc; for measurement below 1.8 K, a
dilution refrigerator option was used. Specific heat measurements were
performed using the quasiadiabatic heat-pulse technique on sintered
polycrystalline pellets attached to the sample stage using thermal
grease. Magnetization measurements were carried out at μ₀H = 1 T and 2
T, and with the susceptibility estimated as
χ ≈ ΔM/ΔH = [M_(2T) − M_(1T)]/[1T]. Isothermal, field-dependent
magnetization measurements were performed over a range of temperatures
and at fields from μ₀H = 0 to 9 T to determine the fraction of impurity
spins that contribute to χ at low temperatures. A self-consistent global
fit of the field-dependent magnetization data sets was performed to a
Brillouin function for impurity paramagnetic spins (with a single set of
three parameters g = 2, J, and concentration, fixed to be the same at
all temperatures) and to a linear function (the true temperature
dependent susceptibility). For resistivity measurements, platinum wires
were attached to sintered polycrystalline pellets using silver paste and
dried under argon in a four point configuration. Equivalent results were
achieved by using Ga_(0.85)In_(0.15) as a molten solder.

## III Results

### Synchrotron x-ray and time-of-flight neutron scattering

Analysis of high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction (SXRD) data
indicates that the average crystallographic symmetry of KNi₂S₂ is
tetragonal (I4/mmm) at all temperatures measured (6.4 K  < T< 440 K;
Fig. 1). In KNi₂S₂, the [Ni₂S₂]⁻ layers of edge-sharing [NiS₄]
tetrahedra are separated by K⁺ ions [Fig. 2]; this leaves the nickel
atoms with a formal valence of "Ni^(1.5+)". No periodic distortions are
found, in contrast to the commensurate distortions observed in
KCu₂Se₂[23] or the incommensurate modulation of β-SrRh₂As₂.[24]

Nonetheless, detailed analysis of the diffraction data reveals a
structural transition near T ∼ 75 K and negative thermal expansion below
T ∼ 9 K. The temperature dependence of the unit cell volume, extracted
from Rietveld analysis, is shown in Fig. 2. A 1 wt

The change in slope in unit cell volume at T = 75 K is coupled to a
striking change in the average structural model required to describe the
data. Adequate fits to the SXRD data collected at room temperature are
obtained only when the Ni atoms are displaced off of the high symmetry
position and are instead statistically distributed in a split-site model
with the lower 2mm site symmetry on the 8g (0, 0.5, z) Wycoff position
[Fig. 1(a), Table 1]. The strongest evidence for the presence of this
distortion comes directly from a Fourier difference map generated from
the undistorted structural model, illustrated in Fig. 3. A dearth of
scattering intensity is located above and below the 4d Ni site, while an
excess of intensity is located at the Ni position of (0, 0.5, 0.25),
illustrated in Fig. 3(b). Introduction of the distortion produces an
undisturbed Fourier

difference map [Fig. 3(c)]. In contrast, at T = 6.4 K, the SXRD data are
described by an ideal ThCr₂Si₂ structure, with Ni atoms on the 4d (0,
0.5, 0.25) Wycoff position with $\overline{4}m2$ site symmetry [Fig.
1(b), Table I]. The temperature dependence of the off-centering is shown
in Fig. 3(d). There is only a small variation with temperature above
T > 75 K. However, the off-centering abruptly disappears on cooling
below T = 75 K.

There are no supercell reflections corresponding to a long range
periodic order of the off-centering. There are no peak splittings or
broadenings in the SXRD data that would suggest a broken local symmetry
on average. We therefore infer that the CDW distortion is localized in
nature, and thus likely dynamic. Therefore, pair distribution function
(PDF) analysis of neutron total scattering data was used to probe the
nature and spatial extent of the distortions. Figure 4(a) shows the PDF
analysis of total scattering data collected at T = 300 K. Consistent

Figure 3: (Color online) (a) Illustration of the (100) crystal plane of
KNi₂Se₂ and Fourier difference maps from data collected at T = 300 K,
viewed on the (001) plane reveal the displacement of Ni atoms from the
(b) ideal 4d (0, 0.5, 0.25) position to the (c) displaced site at 8g (0,
0.5, z). The schematic unit cell on the right illustrates the location
of the Ni atoms (blue spheres). (d) Coincident with the transition in
unit cell volume are charge density wave (CDW) fluctuations that
disappears on cooling as T < 75 K; these CDW fluctuations manifest as a
displacement of the Ni atom (z) from the ideal 4d (0, 0.5, 0.25) site to
the 8g (0, 0.5, z) site. Through all measured temperatures, the
space-group symmetry, I4/mmm is retained, with the displaced z position
requiring a split-site occupancy (4d to 8g). The color denotes the
normalized Rietveld goodness-of-fit (χ²/χ_(best)²; brighter = better
fit) to show the significance of the displacement shift at T ∼ 75 K.

Figure 2: (Color online) (a) From analysis of temperature-dependent
high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction (11-BM, Advanced Photon
Source), a clear transition in unit cell volume of KNi₂S₂ is observed at
T ∼ 75 K (dot-dashed line); no transition is observed at T = 250 K
(dotted line). (b) The temperature dependence of the unit cell volume of
KNi₂S₂ shows two anomalies below T < 13 K, with an overall negative
coefficient of thermal expansion below T < 8.9 K. (dashed lines guide

the size of the symbols.

with the off-centering, there are significant shoulders to the peak at
r ∼ 2.68 A corresponding to modulations in nearest-neighbor Ni-Ni
distances. These displacements again only have a weak temperature
dependence at high temperature, but abruptly disappear below T ∼ 75 K,
concomitant with the observations from the SXRD analysis. Further, the
ideal _14_/_mmm_ crystal structure from the SXRD analysis describes all
of the local pair-wise correlations contained within the T = 15 K PDF
[Fig. 4(c), LS]. Ripples in the PDF with a period Δr = 2π/Q_(max) = 0.18
A, amplified at low r, are artifacts the finite Fourier transformation
used extract the PDF from the scattering data.[26] In contrast, while a
split-site displacement of the Ni position describes the SXRD data at
T = 300 K, it does not adequately describe the shoulders of the
nearest-neighbor Ni-Ni correlation peak in the T = 300 K PDF [Fig. 4(b),
LS and arrows].

The T = 300 K PDF requires at least three distinct Ni-Ni distances at
r ∼ 2.57(1), 2.70(1), and 2.86(1) A (Fig. 5), which are not provided by
the split-site model used for Rietveld analysis of the SXRD data.
Deconvolution of the nearest-neighbor pair-wise correlations is provided
by fitting a linear combination of tetragonal (I4/mmm) and orthorhombic
(Fmmm) phases to the PDF (Fig. 5). Each phase has split-site occupancy
of the Ni atoms which are displaced along the c axis. All nonspecial
internal coordinates and unit cell dimensions were allowed to refine
along with the relative contribution of each phase. The resulting
relative contribution of each fraction of each phase is f_(I4/mmm) = 48
at

Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) simulations of the neutron pair distribution
function and Bragg profile produce atomistic configurations that are
compatible with the average crystallographic symmetry and extended
pairwise correlations [Fig. 4(b), RMC and Fig. 6(a)]. Projection of all
24 000 atoms from the large supercell back onto the crystallographic
unit cell resembles the anisotropic atomic displacement parameters
obtained from Rietveld analysis [Fig. 6(b)]. Furthermore, the supercell
does not reveal any locally ordered patterns [Fig. 6(c)]. Instead, short
and long Ni-Ni bonds appear randomly distributed throughout the lattice
[Fig. 6(d)].

Statistical analysis of the resulting RMC supercell yields an equivalent
ensemble distribution of Ni-Ni distances, while also describing the
extended pair-wise correlations. The trimodal histogram of Ni-Ni
distances [Fig. 7(a)] appears with maxima centered around r ∼ 2.56,
2.67, and 2.85 A, consistent with the least-squares analysis [Fig. 5].
To ensure this distribution is not the trivial result of harmonic but
anisotropic atomic displacements, artificial PDFs and Bragg profiles of
KNi₂S₂ were generated using an ideal I4/mmm unit cell with anisotropic
thermal displacements, akin to Ref. [28]. These profiles were fit using
RMC simulations with the same starting supercell as used with the
experimental data. The histogram of Ni-Ni displacements from an
anisotropic but harmonically distorted structure has much more symmetric
and singly distributed peak shape. Subtraction of the control simulation
from experimental distribution emphasizes and confirms the presence of
three populations of bond lengths, as illustrated in Fig. 5(a). From the
RMC supercell, we were able to extract an ensemble of the bond valence
sums (BVS) over

Figure 4: (Color online) (a) Temperature dependence of the neutron pair
distribution function derived from neutron total scattering data (HPD,
Lujan Center) of KNi₂S₂ shows the presence of multiple nearest-neighbor
Ni-Ni distances observed at T = 300 K that disappear on cooling (dashed
line: ideal Ni-Ni separation). (b) Quantitative modeling of the PDF
(NPDF, Lujan Center) measured at T = 300 K reveals a poor least-squares
fit of the I4/mmm crystal structure determined by SXRD (LS) due to the
presence of multiple Ni-Ni distances (arrows). Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC)
simulations accurately describe the data. (c) In contrast, the T = 15 K
PDF (NPDF) is quantitatively described by a least-squares fit of the
average crystallographic structure with a single Ni-Ni distance.

tetragonal I4/mmm and orthorhombic Fmmm models of KNi₂S₂ to the T = 300

all Ni-S distances contained within [NiS₄] tetrahedra.[29] The
population is symmetrically distributed about a BVS = 2.0, with a
full-width-at-half-maximum of 0.2, as opposed to a noninteger value or
mixed-valence distribution.

In these analyses, there is no evidence for long-range ordered
magnetism. The structural models used to describe the high-resolution
synchrotron diffraction data provide excellent fits to the neutron
powder diffraction data [Figs. 8(a) and 8(b)]. Direct subtraction of
data sets collected at T = 50 K and 5 K [Fig. 8(c)] does not reveal the
appearance of any additional scattering at intermediate or long d
-spacing [Fig. 8(c), inset], as would emerge from magnetic order.

### Physical Properties

Resistivity measurements indicate metallic behavior at all temperatures,
as previously reported [Fig. 9(a)].[30] The resistivity measured at
T = 2 K is $\rho_{\rm 2K}=60(10)$ mΩ cm. There is a discontinuity near
T ∼ 250 K with hysteresis, as observed from first-order phase
transitions. This transition coincides with a significant change in the
isotropic thermal displacement parameter of the K⁺ sublattice as
inferred from the SXRD data [Fig. 9(b)]; however, neither the S position
[Fig. 9(c)] nor the Ni position are greatly disturbed [Fig. 3(d)].

data collected on the forward scattering detector bank (14^(∘)), plotted

displacements. Below is their difference. (b) The ensemble bond valence
sums (BVS) computed from the RMC supercell, which is highly sensitive to
local charge disproportionation (Ref. [27]), indicate a single
population of charged Ni species centered around a BVS = 2.0(2). The
solid line is a fit to a single Gaussian expression.

Measurement of the linear magnetic susceptibility reveals only a weak
temperature dependence (Fig. 10). The magnetization was measured in two
ways: isothermally and at constant field. The constant-field magnetic
susceptibility (χ) was approximated by
$\chi\approx\Delta M/\Delta H=[M_{\rm{2T}}-M_{\rm{1T}}]/[1$T] in order
to subtract trace ferromagnetic Ni impurities that give a subtle
curvature to the T = 300 K magnetization, as shown in Fig. 11(a)
(impurity concentration <1

To extract the trace ferromagnetic impurity from the isothermal
magnetization curves, the T = 300 K magnetization data were subtracted
from the T ≤ 100 K data. To account for the remaining curvature of the
data, we performed a global fit of all of the magnetization data to

$$M-M_{300{\rm K}}=ng\,J\,B_{J}(x)+[\chi(T)-\chi_{300{\rm K}}]\;H,$$
(1)

where χ(T) is the temperature-dependent linear susceptibility,
$\chi_{300{\rm K}}$ is the linear slope of M(H, 300 K), n is the number
of localized paramagnetic spins per mol Ni, g is the gyromagnetic ratio,
J is the total angular momentum, x = (μ_(B)H)/(k_(B)T), H is the applied
magnetic field, and

$$B_{J}(x)=\frac{2J+1}{2J}\coth\left(\frac{(2J+1)x}{2J}\right)-\frac{1}{2J}\coth \left(\frac{x}{2J}\right).$$
(2)

From the global fit with g = 2, we extracted J = 2.0(1) and
n = 3.2(1) × 10⁻⁴ impurity spins per mol Ni. The values of χ(T) are
shown in Fig. 10 as linear M/H. We obtain equivalent values of χ by
simply extracting the slope of the linear portions of the magnetization
curves [χ = ΔM/ΔH; Fig. 11(a)]. Because the values of χ are

$M-M_{300{\rm K}}$ data (open circles).

very small (∼10⁻³ emu mol Ni⁻¹ Oe⁻¹), trace impurities (Ni²⁺, J ∼ 1 to
4) have a significant effect on the observed magnetization.

The linear contributions to the isothermal magnetization follow a weak
temperature dependence; fitting these values [closed squares, Fig. 10]
to the Curie-Weiss equation, χ = C/(T − Θ) + χ₀, allows us to calculate
a lower bound to temperature-independent contribution of the magnetic
susceptibility, χ₀ > 4.9(5) × 10⁻⁴ emu mol Ni⁻¹ Oe⁻¹.

The low-temperature specific heat data (Fig. 12) reveals a λ-type
anomaly consistent with bulk superconductivity at T_(c) = 0.46(2) K. For
1.8 < T < 20 K, the total specific heat was modeled as
C = γ T + β₃T³ + β₅T⁵ to extract the electronic contribution to the
specific heat described by the Sommerfield coefficient, γ = 68(1) mJ
mol⁻¹ K⁻² (Table 2). The specific heat jump at the transition is
ΔC_(e)/γ T_(c) = 1.7. Small external magnetic fields suppress the
superconducting transition, with $H_{c2}(0{\rm K})\sim 0.04(1)$ T,
obtained by fitting the observed field dependence of T_(c) to a
two-fluid model. The Sommerfield coefficient is only weakly dependent on
an applied magnetic field (Fig. 12, inset). The small upturn in the heat
capacity at μ₀H = 14 T for T < 0.2 K is well described by Schottky
anomalies for nuclear and impurity spins.

The previously mentioned changes in the temperature-dependent unit cell
volume (Fig. 2) are observed in both the a and c lattice parameters,
with a sharper transition observed around T = 8.9 K along the a axis
[Fig. 13(a)]. However, sharp λ anomalies are not observed along with
these changes in lattice expansion. Normalization of the specific heat
by T³ (Fig. 13) reveals nondispersive phonon contributions to the
lattice heat capacity. Dispersive phonons should plateau when plotted as
C/T³ with decreasing temperature;[31, 2] meanwhile the electronic
contribution rises sharply (C_(e)/T³ = γ/ T²). Therefore, the
high-temperature specific heat was fit to the combination of a Debye
lattice model and several Einstein modes describing nondispersive,
localized lattice vibrations.

The total heat capacity was described as

$$C_{v} = \gamma\,T+9\,Rs\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{D}}\right)\int_{0}^{x_{D}}\frac{x^{4}e^{x}dx}{(e^{x}-1)^{2}}$$
(3)
$$+\,\sum_{i=1}^{2}p_{i}\,R\,\frac{(\hbar\omega_{i}/k_{B}T)^{2}e^{ \hbar\omega_{i}/k_{B}T}}{(e^{\hbar\omega_{i}/k_{B}T}-1)^{2}},$$

where R is the gas constant, Θ_(D) is the Debye temperature,
x_(D) = Θ_(D)/T, s is the number of Debye oscillators, ℏω_(i) is the
energy of the $i^{\rm th}$ dispersionless mode, and p_(i) is the number
of dispersionless oscillators. By simultaneously fitting the measured
heat capacity to Eq. (3) as C/T (in J mol⁻¹ K⁻²) and as C/T² (in J mol⁻¹
K⁻³), it ensures a proper weighting of the high-temperature curvature of
the Debye expression and the low-temperature curvature of the Einstein
expressions and electronic contributions, respectively. The model
provides an excellent fit to the experimental heat capacity data; the
fit parameters are tabulated in Table II. Two localized (dispersionless)
vibrational modes, each described by an Einstein expression with
energies, ℏω = 7.47(3) meV [87(4) K] and 34(1) meV [394(12) K], are
found in addition to contributions from the Debye expression for
dispersive phonon and the conduction electrons. Fits with only a single
Einstein mode do not provide description of the data, but we cannot rule
out the possibility that there are more than two Einstein modes on the
basis of these data.

## IV Discussion

The subtle but rich structural transitions observed in KNi₂S₂ are
indicative of strongly-correlated electronic physics. The fact that the
Ni displacements disappear upon cooling is a highly unusual observation,
an indicator of an increase in local symmetry upon cooling. To our
knowledge, the only materials in which this has been observed are the
colossal magnetoresistive perovskite manganites,[33, 34, 35] PbRuO3,[36]
the binary lead chalcogenides,[37] and the analogous compound,
KNi₂Se₂.[28] The magnitude of the distortion observed in KNi₂S₂ at
T = 300 K is not as large as found in KNi₂Se₂ (KNi₂Se₂,
$\Delta d_{\rm Ni-Ni}\sim 0.5$ A _vs._ KNi₂S₂,
$\Delta d_{\rm Ni-Ni}\sim 0.18$ A). Furthermore, the transition
temperature is higher for KNi₂S₂ than KNi₂Se₂ (T ∼ 75 K versus T ∼ 20
K).

While many materials exhibiting a negative coefficient of thermal
expansion (NTE) are known, in most examples, such as ReO₃,[38] a NTE
typically arises from the connectivity of rigid polyatomic units that
become less flexible upon cooling or from the increased amplitude of
rigid unit modes upon heating that pulls in the structure, as with the
analogy to a guitar string.[39] Such behavior is not expected in KNi₂S₂
due to the constrained connectivity of edge-sharing [NiS₄] tetrahedra
within the layers. Instead, the negative thermal expansion of KNi₂S₂ may
reflect the breaking of directional bonds and delocalization of charge,
as illustrated by cesium, where the addition of hydrogen results in a
_decrease_ in volume per formula unit from Cs (111.7 A³/Cs) to CsH (64.8
A³/CsH).[40, 41] This comparison suggests that we observe the formation
of a more delocalized electronic state in KNi₂S₂ at the lowest
temperatures and analogous to the driving force behind anomalous thermal
expansion in heavy fermion materials (e.g., URu₂Si₂).[42, 43] These
observations may also be related to intermediate valence compounds,
YbCuAl[44] or CeAl₃,[45] where a more spatially extended valence state
is favored at lower temperatures.

However, here such an effect requires an involvement of direct Ni-Ni
bonding, as the bond valence sum analysis of the Ni-S bonding does not
show any evidence for charge disproportionation or Jahn-Teller
distortions in KNi₂S₂.[27, 46] Instead, our results and the absence of
charge order are consistent with the off-centering displacements arising
from charge density wave (CDW) fluctuations within a manifold comprised
predominately of Ni d_(x² − y²) orbitals, as proposed for KNi₂Se₂.[28]
Electronic CDW instabilities are known to give rise to myriad structural
distortions,[47, 48] and were discussed in the context of electronic
mass-enhanced metals in Refs. [28] and [49]. One possible explanation
for the smaller distortion in KNi₂S₂ compared to KNi₂Se₂ is that the
slight increase in electronegativity of S from Se withdraws electron
density from the band derived from Ni d_(x² − y²) states. Alternatively,
the smaller ionic radius of S²⁻ compared to Se²⁻ results in a
significantly reduced average Ni-Ni distance in KNi₂S₂; the resulting
increase in bandwidth would make the Ni-Ni antibonding band less
susceptible to CDW fluctuations. These CDW fluctuations are spatially
related to not only the long-range ordered CDWs observed in KCu₂Se₂ and
SrRh₂As₂,[23, 24] but also the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural
distortions observed in BaFe₂As₂[50] and Fe_(1.01)Se.[51]

Quantitative analysis of the specific heat at higher temperatures
reveals insight into the dynamic nature of the structural anomalies as
charge density wave fluctuations. Upon cooling, most of the entropy of
the 34(1) meV mode is released at a similar temperature scale to the
disappearance of the CDW fluctuations; the entropy of the 7.47(3) meV
mode is released at the same temperature scale as the observation of
negative thermal expansion behavior T < 8.9 K (Fig. 13). Analysis of the
heat capacity is consistent with both the loss of a CDW around T ∼ 75 K
and the emergence of heavy electron physics at low temperature,
suggesting that the two phenomena are interrelated.

While a significant increase in carrier mobility concomitant with the
depopulation of Ni displacements was observed in KNi₂Se₂,[28] the
transport properties of KNi₂S₂ appear to be dominated by the freezing of
the K⁺ sublattice [Fig. 9(a)], as inferred from the significant decrease
in the K $U_{\rm iso}$ obtained from the SXRD data [Fig. 9(b)]. Such
transitions are usually first order due to an associated latent heat, as
per liquid-solid transitions,[52] and potassium has been shown to be
readily mobile in the related compound KNi₂Se₂ at room temperature.[15]
This potassium ion freezing process likely introduces many electronic
scattering centers which prevents an accurate measurement of the
intrinsic resistivity and a direct comparison to KNi₂Se₂.

We observe two significant thermodynamic signatures of many-body physics
of KNi₂S₂ in addition to the negative thermal expansion:
superconductivity and an enhanced electronic band mass. The
low-temperature specific heat data (Fig. 12) reveals a λ-type anomaly
consistent with bulk superconductivity at T_(c) = 0.46(2) K. Such a
small H_(c2) (compared to T_(c)) is indicative of an enhanced mass of
conduction elections, between m_(H_(c2))^(*) = 40m_(e) and 80m_(e). This
estimate of the degree of electronic mass enhancement depends on the
assumptions about the size and shape of the Fermi surface. Using the
extrapolated T = 0 K upper critical field, H_(c2) = 0.04(1) T, the
average zero-temperature coherence length of the superconducting state
is ξ(0) = [ϕ₀/(2πH_(c2))]^(1/2) = 90(10) nm.[53] The Fermi velocity is
estimated from T_(c) and ξ using the relation
v_(F) = (k_(B)T_(c)ξ)/(0.18ℏ) = 3(1) × 10⁴ m/s. Then, assuming a
spherical Fermi surface, the Fermi wavevector is estimated from the
carrier density, n= carriers per unit cell volume, using
k_(F) = (3nπ²)^(1/3). If there are 1.5 carriers per Ni, then
k_(F) = 0.99(1) A⁻¹, while if all 33 valence electrons per formula unit
contribute, then k_(F) = 2.2(1) A⁻¹. The resulting mass enhancement is
then calculated from the relation m^(*)/m = ℏk_(F)/v_(F), and ranges
from m_(H_(c2))^(*)/m = 40 to 80.

The specific heat in the normal state above T_(c) also points to an
enhanced band mass: the low-temperature Sommerfield coefficient,
γ = 68(1) mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻², represents a significant electronic mass
enhancement, between m^(*) = 11m_(e) and 24m_(e). To estimate the
electronic band mass enhancement, we assume a spherical Fermi surface
with either 33 valence electrons per formula unit, or 3 valence
electrons per formula unit (Ni^(1.5+)). The carrier density n is given
by the number of carriers N per cell volume V to give n = N/V, which is
used in the calculation of the Fermi wavevector, k_(F) = (3π²n)^(1/3),
in order to estimate the densities of states at the Fermi energy
g(E_(F)). The Sommerfield coefficient from the spherical Fermi surface
is given by γ_(e) = π²k_(B)²g(E_(F))/3. The electronic band-mass
enhancement is then estimated from
$m^{*}/m_{e}=\gamma_{\rm measured}/\gamma_{e}$.

This electronic mass enhancement, comparable to that extracted from the
upper critical field, represents a much larger mass enhancement than is
generally observed in metallic correlated solids[54, 55] and is
comparable to the mass enhancement observed in the archetypical heavy
fermion compound URu₂Si₂.[56] Unlike prototypical heavy fermion
materials,[57, 58, 59] however, the Sommerfield coefficient is only
weakly dependent on an applied magnetic field (Fig. 12, inset),
suggesting at most a minor role for magnetism or magnetic fluctuations
in producing the heavy mass state. This is additionally supported by the
lack of localized magnetism observed in magnetic susceptibility
measurements (Figs. 10 and 11) and high-flux neutron powder diffraction
experiments (Fig. 8).

## V Conclusions

In short, our data show that KNi₂S₂ exhibits a rich and unusual
electronic and structural phase diagram below T ∼ 440 K, as summarized
in Fig. 14. Near room temperature, the K⁺ sublattice is mobile and
exhibits what appears to be a freezing transition near T ∼ 250 K. Above
T ∼ 75 K, there are aperiodic, incoherent CDW fluctuations corresponding
to displacements of the Ni-Ni sublattice, concomitant with complete
release of the entropy from a localized vibrational mode at ℏω = 34(1)
meV. Below T ∼ 75 K, we observe an intermediate state, which can be
described as a correlated metallic state in which there is no CDW nor
significant electronic mass enhancement. Upon further cooling, KNi₂S₂
displays a significantly enhanced electronic mass,
11 < m^(*)/m_(e) < 24, with a concomitant lattice expansion (negative
coefficient of thermal expansion) and the entropy release of a
dispersionless vibrational mode of 7.47(3) meV. Below T_(c) = 0.46(2) K
there is a superconducting transition that is suppressed by
H_(c2)(0K) = 0.04(1) T. Surprisingly, all of these strongly correlated
behaviors occur in the absence of localized magnetism. Instead, our
results suggest that the origin of heavy electron behavior in KNi₂S₂
lies in the hybridization of nearly localized and bonded states with
conduction electrons.[28, 49] While many similarities exist between
KNi₂S₂ and KNi₂Se₂, likely derived from the nature of Ni-Ni interactions
and formal electron count, there are sufficient differences to
illustrate that the rich electronic physics result from the admixture of
different electronic manifolds. It will be interesting to establish how
proximity to charge order can drive strongly correlated physics in this
and related materials families.
