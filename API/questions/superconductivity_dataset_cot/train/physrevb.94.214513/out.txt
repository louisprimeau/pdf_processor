###### Abstract

The noncentrosymmetric superconductor Re_{6}Zr has attracted much interest for its possible unconventional superconducting state with broken time-reversal symmetry. Here we report ^{185/187}Re nuclear quadrupole resonance measurements on Re_{6}Zr (T_{c} = 6.72 K) and the isostructural compounds Re_{27}Zr_{5} (T_{c} = 6.53 K) and Re_{64}Zr_{5} (T_{c} = 5.00 K). The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T_{1} shows a coherence peak below T_{c} and decreases exponentially at low temperatures in all three samples. The superconducting gap \Delta derived from the 1/T_{1} data is 2\Delta=3.58k_{B}T_{c}, 3.55k_{B}T_{c}, and 3.51k_{B}T_{c} for Re_{6}Zr, Re_{27}Zr_{5}, and Re_{24}Zr_{5}, respectively, which is close to the value of 3.53k_{B}T_{c} expected for weak-coupling superconductivity. These data suggest conventional s-wave superconductivity with a fully opened gap in this series of compounds.

## I Introduction

Superconductors with broken symmetries, such as broken time-reversal symmetry [1] or broken spin-rotation symmetry [2], have attracted great attention. In particular, the role of the crystal structure in the emergence of unconventional superconducting states has been studied extensively in recent years.

In superconductors with an inversion center in the crystal structure, either an even-parity spin-singlet or an odd-parity spin-triplet superconducting state is realized. However, in noncentrosymmetric superconductors, a parity-mixed superconducting state is allowed and an antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling (ASOC) interaction is induced [3, 4, 5]. The parity-mixing extent is determined by the strength of the ASOC.

Indeed, some noncentrosymmetric superconductors show novel features. For example, isostructural Li_{2}Pd_{3}B and Li_{2}Pt_{3}B show contrasting behaviors. Li_{2}Pd_{3}B exhibits conventional BCS-type properties [6], while Li_{2}Pt_{3}B is a spin-triplet dominant superconductor [7] with nodes in the gap function [7,8]. In this case, a different ASOC due to differences in peculiar crystal structure distortion and atomic number were responsible for the different superconducting states [9]. After the discovery of spin-triplet superconductivity in Li_{2}Pt_{3}B, extensive studies have been performed to search for novel superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric superconductors containing heavy elements such as Mg_{10+x}Ir_{19-y}B [10], BiPd [11], and ScIrP [12], but parity-mixing is found to be weak [13,14], due to a crystal structure that does not lead to strong ASOC enhancement.

Recently, more novel properties were reported in some noncentrosymmetric superconductors. For example, a small internal magnetic field was detected below T_{c} in noncentrosymmetric LaNiC_{2}, which was interpreted as due to a breaking of time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state [1], although a relation between the breaking of inversion symmetry and time-reversal symmetry is unclear.

Noncentrosymmetric Re_{6}Zr is a new candidate for a time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconductor. Re_{6}Zr has an \alpha-Mn type cubic crystal structure with space group I\bar{4}3m[15] and a large upper critical field close to the Pauli limit [16]. Figure 1 shows the \alpha-Mn type crystal structure, which has four independent crystallographic sites Mn I: 2a (Wyckoff), 43m (Hermann-Mauguin), Mn II: 8c,3m, Mn III: 24g_{1},m, and Mn IV: 24g_{2},m[17]. Among them, only the Mn I (2a,43m) site has an inversion center. An internal magnetic field was detected in the superconducting state by muon spin relaxation or rotation (\muSR) measurements [16]. The result was ascribed to broken time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state. It is known that a chiral p-wave state or a chiral d-wave state can produce a tiny internal magnetic field [18,19].

In order to investigate the gap structure, we performed nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements on Re_{6}Zr, and the isostructural compounds Re_{27}Zr_{5} and Re_{24}Zr_{5}. These compounds have an \alpha-Mn type crystal structure but with different superconducting transition temperatures, with Re_{24}Zr_{5} being stoichiometric. The NQR measurement performed at zero magnetic field is one of the most powerful methods for the study of the superconducting gap symmetry. We find that all the three compounds show superconducting properties consistent with a conventional BCS gap symmetry.

## II Experiment

The polycrystalline samples of Re_{6}Zr, Re_{27}Zr_{5}, and Re_{24}Zr_{5} in this study were synthesized by the arc-melting method. The Re (99.99%) and Zr (99.9%) were arc melted under an argon atmosphere. The difference in mass before and after the melting was less than 1% for all samples. The melted ingots were crushed into powders for x-ray diffraction (XRD) and NQR measurements. The Cu K\alpha radiation is used for the XRD measurements. The T_{c} was determined by measuring the ac susceptibility using the _in situ_ NQR coil. A standard phase-coherent pulsed NMR spectrometer was used to collect data. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate was measured by using a single saturation pulse. The spin echo was observed with a sequence of \pi/2 pulse (4 \mus)-30 \mus-\pi pulse (8 \mus).

## III Results and Discussions

Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns and the ac susceptibility results for Re_{6}Zr, Re_{27}Zr_{5}, and Re_{24}Zr_{5}. The lattice constant a is 9.714 A for Re_{6}Zr, which is a little shorter than the reported value of 9.698 A [15]. The T_{c} for Re_{6}Zr is 6.72 K,

 which is very close to 6.75 K reported in Ref. [16]. The obtained lattice constant and T_{c} are shown in Table 1. For Re_{6}Zr and Re_{27}Zr_{5}, the XRD patterns can be fitted by the Rietveld method. For Re_{24}Zr_{5}, some unidentified peaks are observed. The linewidth increases with increasing Zr composition, which suggests that impurities or crystal distortions increase with increasing Zr composition. In the ac susceptibility for Re_{24}Zr_{5}, a small shoulder can be seen around T_{c}, which is likely attributable to the sample inhomogeneity. A similar result has been reported in Nb-Re systems [20]. In \alpha-Mn type systems, Re_{24}Zr_{5} is stoichiometric, while Re_{6}Zr and Re_{27}Zr_{5} are nonstoichiometric with Re-rich compositions. In the Re_{x}Zr_{1-x} binary phase diagram [21], a single phase \alpha-Mn structure can be obtained only in a narrow range with 0.82\leqslant x\leqslant 0.87. The Re-to-Zr ratio is 82.8:17.2 for stoichiometric Re_{24}Zr_{5}, which is quite close to the limit to obtain a single phase. On the other hand, the Re-to-Zr ratio is 84.4:15.6 for Re_{27}Zr_{5} and 85.7:14.3 for Re_{6}Zr. As seen in Fig. 2, the stoichiometric Re_{24}Zr_{5} compound showed a small amount of additional peaks in the XRD chart, which is likely due to the fact that the Re_{24}Zr_{5} is close to the phase boundary.

Figure 3 shows the ^{185/187}Re -NQR spectra at T=10 K for the three samples. Four peaks were observed for all samples. The Re nuclei have a spin I=\frac{5}{2}, which will result in two transitions. In Re-Zr systems with an \alpha-Mn type structure, the unit cell has 58 atoms that are distributed into two Zr sites (2a,8c) and two Re sites (24g_{1},24g_{2}) [22]. Furthermore,

The arrows indicate T_{c} for each sample.

  Re has two isotopes ^{185}Re (natural abundance 37.5%) and ^{187}Re (62.5%). As a result, eight peaks for this compound are expected, in principle. However, the difference in the nuclear quadrupole moment Q of ^{185}Re (2.7\times 10^{-24} cm^{2}) and ^{187}Re (2.6\times 10^{-24} cm^{2}) is only 4%, which leads to the inability of distinguishing ^{185}Re from ^{187}Re in the broad spectra and thus only four peaks were observed. As can be seen in Fig. 3, only the uppermost peak varies upon changing the Re-Zr composition ratio. By a theoretical simulation (see below), we assigned the lower two peaks to site A and the upper two peaks to site B. At the moment, it is unclear which site (A or B) corresponds to which Re site in the crystal structure. The Hamiltonian for the quadrupole interaction is

\[\mathcal{H}=\frac{v_{Q}}{6}\left\{(3I^{2}-\widetilde{I}^{2})+\frac{\eta}{2}(I _{+}^{2}+I_{-}^{2})\right\}.\] (1)

Here, v_{Q} and \eta are defined as

\[v_{Q}\equiv v_{z}=\frac{3}{2I(2I-1)h}e^{2}Q\frac{\partial^{2}V}{\partial z^{2}},\] (2)

\[\eta=\frac{|v_{x}-v_{y}|}{v_{z}},\] (3)

with \frac{\partial^{2}V}{\partial u^{2}} (\alpha=x,y,z) being the electric field gradient at the position of the nucleus. In the simulations, a Gaussian function \exp\left\{-(f/2\delta)^{2}\right\} is convoluted, where f is the frequency and \delta is related to the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the transition line as \text{FWHM}=2\delta\sqrt{2\ln(2)}. The v_{Q} and \eta were treated as parameters. The intensity ratio of each peak depends on \eta. With the parameters listed in Table 1, we are able to reproduce the experimental results as seen in Fig. 3. We note that v_{Q} or the FWHM is proportional to Q, so the value for ^{185}Re (_Q_ = 2.7\times 10^{-24} cm^{2}) is 1.04 times the value for ^{187}Re (_Q_ = 2.6\times 10^{-24} cm^{2}). The intensity for the uppermost peak does not agree with the simulation, probably due to a worse quality factor of the coil in this frequency range. In the case of large \eta, a signal from the forbidden transitions (\pm\frac{1}{2}\leftrightarrow\pm\frac{5}{2}) is expected. Indeed, we detected such signals in the frequency range above 200 MHz, as seen in Fig. 3.

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of 1/T_{1} of ^{185/187}Re -NQR, which was measured at the 1v_{Q} (\pm\frac{1}{2}\leftrightarrow\pm\frac{3}{2}) transition of site B. The nuclear magnetization decay curve for each compound is well fitted to the theoretical formula for different \eta[23],

\[\text{Re}_{6}\text{Zr}:\frac{M_{0}-M(t)}{M_{0}}=0.163\exp\left(- \frac{3.00t}{T_{1}}\right)\] \[\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad+0.837\exp\left(-\frac{8 .52t}{T_{1}}\right),\] (4) \[\text{Re}_{27}\text{Zr}_{5}:\frac{M_{0}-M(t)}{M_{0}}=0.170\exp \left(-\frac{3.00t}{T_{1}}\right)\] \[\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad+0.830\exp \left(-\frac{8.42t}{T_{1}}\right),\] (5) \[\text{Re}_{24}\text{Zr}_{5}:\frac{M_{0}-M(t)}{M_{0}}=0.187\exp \left(-\frac{3.00t}{T_{1}}\right)\] \[\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad+0.813\exp \left(-\frac{8.23t}{T_{1}}\right),\] (6)

  where M_{0} is the nuclear magnetization in the thermal equilibrium and M(t) is the nuclear magnetization at a time t after the saturating pulse. We have confirmed that T_{1} measured at the \pm\frac{3}{2}\leftrightarrow\pm\frac{5}{2} transition gives the same value. The recovery curve can be fitted with a single T_{1} component below and above T_{c}, which indicates that the macroscopic phase separation in the sample is small, if any. As seen in the figure, 1/\,T_{1} varies in proportion to the temperature (T) above T_{c} for all samples, as expected for conventional metals, indicating no electron-electron interaction. Below T_{c}, 1/\,T_{1} shows a coherence peak (Hebel-Slichter peak) expected for an s-wave superconducting state. The 1/\,T_{1S} in the superconducting state is expressed as

\[\frac{T_{1N}}{T_{1S}} = \frac{2}{k_{B}T}\int\left(1+\frac{\Delta^{2}}{EE^{\prime}}\right) N_{S}(E)N_{S}(E^{\prime})\] (7) \[\times f(E)[1-f(E^{\prime})]\delta(E-E^{\prime})dB\,dE^{\prime},\]

where 1/\,T_{1N} is the relaxation rate in the normal state, N_{S}(E) is the superconducting density of states (DOS), f(E) is the Fermi distribution function, and C=1+\frac{\Delta^{2}}{E^{\prime}} is the coherence factor. To perform the calculation of Eq. (7), we follow Hebel to convolute N_{S}(E) with a broadening function B(E)[24], which is approximated by a rectangular function centered at E with a height of 1/2S. The solid curve below T_{c} shown in Fig. 4 is a calculation with 2\Delta=3.58k_{B}T_{c}, b\equiv\delta/\Delta(0)=0.030 for Re_{2}Zr, 2\Delta=3.55k_{B}T_{c}, b=0.058 for Re_{2}Zr_{5}, and 2\Delta=3.51k_{B}T_{c}, b=0.107 for Re_{24}Zr_{5}. The curve fits the experimental data reasonably well. The parameter 2\Delta is close to the BCS value of 3.53k_{B}T_{c}. This result indicates an isotropic superconducting gap in these compounds. A similar conclusion was drawn by a recent London penetration depth measurement for Re_{6}Zr [25].

Our result is inconsistent with a time-reversal symmetry-broken superconducting state such as d+id or p+ip where the coherence peak will be absent. We note that inconsistent results from different probes have been reported in LaNiC_{2}, PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, and the locally noncentrosymmetric superconductor SrPtAs that has an inversion center in a whole unit cell but not within a single layer. In these samples, time-reversal symmetry breaking was suggested by \muSR [1, 19, 26], but an s-wave superconductivity was confirmed by NQR/NMR measurements [27, 28, 29]. In these materials, breaking of time-reversal symmetry has not been observed, except for \muSR.

## IV Summary

In summary, we have performed ^{185/187}Re -NQR measurements on the noncentrosymmetric superconductors Re_{6}Zr, Re_{27}Zr_{5}, and Re_{24}Zr_{5}. The T-linear behavior of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/\,T_{1} above T_{c} indicates the absence of spin correlations. The 1/\,T_{1} shows a Hebel-Slichter peak just below T_{c} and decreases exponentially at low temperatures for all samples, which suggests that the \alpha-Mn type Re-Zr system is in an s-wave fully gapped superconducting state, which is inconsistent with a time-reversal symmetry-breaking state such as d+id or p+ip.

###### Abstract

The noncentrosymmetric superconductor Re_{6}Zr has attracted much interest for its possible unconventional superconducting state with broken time-reversal symmetry. Here we report ^{185/187}Re nuclear quadrupole resonance measurements on Re_{6}Zr (T_{c} = 6.72 K) and the isostructural compounds Re_{27}Zr_{5} (T_{c} = 6.53 K) and Re_{64}Zr_{5} (T_{c} = 5.00 K).

The superconducting gap \Delta derived from the 1/T_{1} data is 2\Delta=3.58k_{B}T_{c}, 3.55k_{B}T_{c}, and 3.51k_{B}T_{c} for Re_{6}Zr, Re_{27}Zr_{5}, and Re_{24}Zr_{5}, respectively, which is close to the value of 3.53k_{B}T_{c} expected for weak-coupling superconductivity. These data suggest conventional s-wave superconductivity with a fully opened gap in this series of compounds.

## I Introduction

Superconductors with broken symmetries, such as broken time-reversal symmetry [1] or broken spin-rotation symmetry [2], have attracted great attention. In particular, the role of the crystal structure in the emergence of unconventional superconducting states has been studied extensively in recent years.

In superconductors with an inversion center in the crystal structure, either an even-parity spin-singlet or an odd-parity spin-triplet superconducting state is realized. However, in noncentrosymmetric superconductors, a parity-mixed superconducting state is allowed and an antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling (ASOC) interaction is induced [3, 4, 5]. The parity-mixing extent is determined by the strength of the ASOC.

Indeed, some noncentrosymmetric superconductors show novel features. For example, isostructural Li_{2}Pd_{3}B and Li_{2}Pt_{3}B show contrasting behaviors. Li_{2}Pd_{3}B exhibits conventional BCS-type properties [6], while Li_{2}Pt_{3}B is a spin-triplet dominant superconductor [7] with nodes in the gap function [7,8]. In this case, a different ASOC due to differences in peculiar crystal structure distortion and atomic number were responsible for the different superconducting states [9]. After the discovery of spin-triplet superconductivity in Li_{2}Pt_{3}B, extensive studies have been performed to search for novel superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric superconductors containing heavy elements such as Mg_{10+x}Ir_{19-y}B [10], BiPd [11], and ScIrP [12], but parity-mixing is found to be weak [13,14], due to a crystal structure that does not lead to strong ASOC enhancement.

Recently, more novel properties were reported in some noncentrosymmetric superconductors. For example, a small internal magnetic field was detected below T_{c} in noncentrosymmetric LaNiC_{2}, which was interpreted as due to a breaking of time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state [1], although a relation between the breaking of inversion symmetry and time-reversal symmetry is unclear.

Noncentrosymmetric Re_{6}Zr is a new candidate for a time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconductor. Re_{6}Zr has an \alpha-Mn type cubic crystal structure with space group I\bar{4}3m[15] and a large upper critical field close to the Pauli limit [16]. Figure 1 shows the \alpha-Mn type crystal structure, which has four independent crystallographic sites Mn I: 2a (Wyckoff), 43m (Hermann-Mauguin), Mn II: 8c,3m, Mn III: 24g_{1},m, and Mn IV: 24g_{2},m[17]. Among them, only the Mn I (2a,43m) site has an inversion center. An internal magnetic field was detected in the superconducting state by muon spin relaxation or rotation (\muSR) measurements [16]. The result was ascribed to broken time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state. It is known that a chiral p-wave state or a chiral d-wave state can produce a tiny internal magnetic field [18,19].

In order to investigate the gap structure, we performed nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements on Re_{6}Zr, and the isostructural compounds Re_{27}Zr_{5} and Re_{24}Zr_{5}. These compounds have an \alpha-Mn type crystal structure but with different superconducting transition temperatures, with Re_{24}Zr_{5} being stoichiometric. The NQR measurement performed at zero magnetic field is one of the most powerful methods for the study of the superconducting gap symmetry. We find that all the three compounds show superconducting properties consistent with a conventional BCS gap symmetry.

The polycrystalline samples of Re_{6}Zr, Re_{27}Zr_{5}, and Re_{24}Zr_{5} in this study were synthesized by the arc-melting method. The Re (99.99%) and Zr (99.9%) were arc melted under an argon atmosphere. The difference in mass before and after the melting was less than 1% for all samples. The melted ingots were crushed into powders for x-ray diffraction (XRD) and NQR measurements. The Cu K\alpha radiation is used for the XRD measurements. The T_{c} was determined by measuring the ac susceptibility using the _in situ_ NQR coil. A standard phase-coherent pulsed NMR spectrometer was used to collect data. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate was measured by using a single saturation pulse. The spin echo was observed with a sequence of \pi/2 pulse (4 \mus)-30 \mus-\pi pulse (8 \mus).

## III Results and Discussions

Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns and the ac susceptibility results for Re_{6}Zr, Re_{27}Zr_{5}, and Re_{24}Zr_{5}. The lattice constant a is 9.714 A for Re_{6}Zr, which is a little shorter than the reported value of 9.698 A [15]. The T_{c} for Re_{6}Zr is 6.72 K,

 which is very close to 6.75 K reported in Ref. [16]. The obtained lattice constant and T_{c} are shown in Table 1. For Re_{6}Zr and Re_{27}Zr_{5}, the XRD patterns can be fitted by the Rietveld method. For Re_{24}Zr_{5}, some unidentified peaks are observed. The linewidth increases with increasing Zr composition, which suggests that impurities or crystal distortions increase with increasing Zr composition. In the ac susceptibility for Re_{24}Zr_{5}, a small shoulder can be seen around T_{c}, which is likely attributable to the sample inhomogeneity. A similar result has been reported in Nb-Re systems [20]. In \alpha-Mn type systems, Re_{24}Zr_{5} is stoichiometric, while Re_{6}Zr and Re_{27}Zr_{5} are nonstoichiometric with Re-rich compositions. In the Re_{x}Zr_{1-x} binary phase diagram [21], a single phase \alpha-Mn structure can be obtained only in a narrow range with 0.82\leqslant x\leqslant 0.87. The Re-to-Zr ratio is 82.8:17.2 for stoichiometric Re_{24}Zr_{5}, which is quite close to the limit to obtain a single phase. On the other hand, the Re-to-Zr ratio is 84.4:15.6 for Re_{27}Zr_{5} and 85.7:14.3 for Re_{6}Zr. As seen in Fig. 2, the stoichiometric Re_{24}Zr_{5} compound showed a small amount of additional peaks in the XRD chart, which is likely due to the fact that the Re_{24}Zr_{5} is close to the phase boundary.

Figure 3 shows the ^{185/187}Re -NQR spectra at T=10 K for the three samples. Four peaks were observed for all samples. The Re nuclei have a spin I=\frac{5}{2}, which will result in two transitions. In Re-Zr systems with an \alpha-Mn type structure, the unit cell has 58 atoms that are distributed into two Zr sites (2a,8c) and two Re sites (24g_{1},24g_{2}) [22]. Furthermore,

  Re has two isotopes ^{185}Re (natural abundance 37.5%) and ^{187}Re (62.5%). As a result, eight peaks for this compound are expected, in principle. However, the difference in the nuclear quadrupole moment Q of ^{185}Re (2.7\times 10^{-24} cm^{2}) and ^{187}Re (2.6\times 10^{-24} cm^{2}) is only 4%, which leads to the inability of distinguishing ^{185}Re from ^{187}Re in the broad spectra and thus only four peaks were observed. As can be seen in Fig. 3, only the uppermost peak varies upon changing the Re-Zr composition ratio. By a theoretical simulation (see below), we assigned the lower two peaks to site A and the upper two peaks to site B. At the moment, it is unclear which site (A or B) corresponds to which Re site in the crystal structure. The Hamiltonian for the quadrupole interaction is

\[\mathcal{H}=\frac{v_{Q}}{6}\left\{(3I^{2}-\widetilde{I}^{2})+\frac{\eta}{2}(I _{+}^{2}+I_{-}^{2})\right\}.\] (1)

Here, v_{Q} and \eta are defined as

\[v_{Q}\equiv v_{z}=\frac{3}{2I(2I-1)h}e^{2}Q\frac{\partial^{2}V}{\partial z^{2}},\] (2)

\[\eta=\frac{|v_{x}-v_{y}|}{v_{z}},\] (3)

with \frac{\partial^{2}V}{\partial u^{2}} (\alpha=x,y,z) being the electric field gradient at the position of the nucleus. In the simulations, a Gaussian function \exp\left\{-(f/2\delta)^{2}\right\} is convoluted, where f is the frequency and \delta is related to the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the transition line as \text{FWHM}=2\delta\sqrt{2\ln(2)}. The v_{Q} and \eta were treated as parameters. The intensity ratio of each peak depends on \eta. With the parameters listed in Table 1, we are able to reproduce the experimental results as seen in Fig. 3. We note that v_{Q} or the FWHM is proportional to Q, so the value for ^{185}Re (_Q_ = 2.7\times 10^{-24} cm^{2}) is 1.04 times the value for ^{187}Re (_Q_ = 2.6\times 10^{-24} cm^{2}). The intensity for the uppermost peak does not agree with the simulation, probably due to a worse quality factor of the coil in this frequency range. In the case of large \eta, a signal from the forbidden transitions (\pm\frac{1}{2}\leftrightarrow\pm\frac{5}{2}) is expected. Indeed, we detected such signals in the frequency range above 200 MHz, as seen in Fig. 3.

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of 1/T_{1} of ^{185/187}Re -NQR, which was measured at the 1v_{Q} (\pm\frac{1}{2}\leftrightarrow\pm\frac{3}{2}) transition of site B. The nuclear magnetization decay curve for each compound is well fitted to the theoretical formula for different \eta[23],

\[\text{Re}_{6}\text{Zr}:\frac{M_{0}-M(t)}{M_{0}}=0.163\exp\left(- \frac{3.00t}{T_{1}}\right)\] \[\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad+0.837\exp\left(-\frac{8 .52t}{T_{1}}\right),\] (4) \[\text{Re}_{27}\text{Zr}_{5}:\frac{M_{0}-M(t)}{M_{0}}=0.170\exp \left(-\frac{3.00t}{T_{1}}\right)\] \[\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad+0.830\exp \left(-\frac{8.42t}{T_{1}}\right),\] (5) \[\text{Re}_{24}\text{Zr}_{5}:\frac{M_{0}-M(t)}{M_{0}}=0.187\exp \left(-\frac{3.00t}{T_{1}}\right)\] \[\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad+0.813\exp \left(-\frac{8.23t}{T_{1}}\right),\] (6)

  where M_{0} is the nuclear magnetization in the thermal equilibrium and M(t) is the nuclear magnetization at a time t after the saturating pulse. We have confirmed that T_{1} measured at the \pm\frac{3}{2}\leftrightarrow\pm\frac{5}{2} transition gives the same value. The recovery curve can be fitted with a single T_{1} component below and above T_{c}, which indicates that the macroscopic phase separation in the sample is small, if any. As seen in the figure, 1/\,T_{1} varies in proportion to the temperature (T) above T_{c} for all samples, as expected for conventional metals, indicating no electron-electron interaction. Below T_{c}, 1/\,T_{1} shows a coherence peak (Hebel-Slichter peak) expected for an s-wave superconducting state. The 1/\,T_{1S} in the superconducting state is expressed as

\[\frac{T_{1N}}{T_{1S}} = \frac{2}{k_{B}T}\int\left(1+\frac{\Delta^{2}}{EE^{\prime}}\right) N_{S}(E)N_{S}(E^{\prime})\] (7) \[\times f(E)[1-f(E^{\prime})]\delta(E-E^{\prime})dB\,dE^{\prime},\]

where 1/\,T_{1N} is the relaxation rate in the normal state, N_{S}(E) is the superconducting density of states (DOS), f(E) is the Fermi distribution function, and C=1+\frac{\Delta^{2}}{E^{\prime}} is the coherence factor. To perform the calculation of Eq. (7), we follow Hebel to convolute N_{S}(E) with a broadening function B(E)[24], which is approximated by a rectangular function centered at E with a height of 1/2S. The solid curve below T_{c} shown in Fig. 4 is a calculation with 2\Delta=3.58k_{B}T_{c}, b\equiv\delta/\Delta(0)=0.030 for Re_{2}Zr, 2\Delta=3.55k_{B}T_{c}, b=0.058 for Re_{2}Zr_{5}, and 2\Delta=3.51k_{B}T_{c}, b=0.107 for Re_{24}Zr_{5}. The curve fits the experimental data reasonably well. The parameter 2\Delta is close to the BCS value of 3.53k_{B}T_{c}. This result indicates an isotropic superconducting gap in these compounds. A similar conclusion was drawn by a recent London penetration depth measurement for Re_{6}Zr [25].

Our result is inconsistent with a time-reversal symmetry-broken superconducting state such as d+id or p+ip where the coherence peak will be absent. We note that inconsistent results from different probes have been reported in LaNiC_{2}, PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, and the locally noncentrosymmetric superconductor SrPtAs that has an inversion center in a whole unit cell but not within a single layer. In these samples, time-reversal symmetry breaking was suggested by \muSR [1, 19, 26], but an s-wave superconductivity was confirmed by NQR/NMR measurements [27, 28, 29]. In these materials, breaking of time-reversal symmetry has not been observed, except for \muSR.

## IV Summary

In summary, we have performed ^{185/187}Re -NQR measurements on the noncentrosymmetric superconductors Re_{6}Zr, Re_{27}Zr_{5}, and Re_{24}Zr_{5}. The T-linear behavior of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/\,T_{1} above T_{c} indicates the absence of spin correlations. The 1/\,T_{1} shows a Hebel-Slichter peak just below T_{c} and decreases exponentially at low temperatures for all samples, which suggests that the \alpha-Mn type Re-Zr system is in an s-wave fully gapped superconducting state, which is inconsistent with a time-reversal symmetry-breaking state such as d+id or p+ip.
