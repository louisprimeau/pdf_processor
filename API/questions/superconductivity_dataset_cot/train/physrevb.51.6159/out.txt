###### Abstract

The antiferromagnetic and superconducting properties of a thiospinel Cu1.5Co1.5S4 (_T_{N}_ = 19.0 K, _T_{c}_ = 2.3 K) have been investigated with ^{63}Cu NMR (75 MHz), ^{59}Co NMR (75 MHz), and ^{59}Co pure quadrupole resonance between T = 1.23 and 150 K. The linear dependence of negative ^{63}Cu Knight shift (- 0.013% at 4.2 K) on the Curie-Weiss-type susceptibility (_X_T_) and nearly independent ^{59}Co Knight shift (+1.43%) indicate that the d hole band of Cu at the tetrahedral A site is mainly responsible for the spin paramagnetism. The spin-lattice relaxation rates (_T_1_T_)^{-1} of both ^{63}Cu and ^{59}Co are significantly enhanced with lowering temperature below \sim 100 K, similar to those observed in high-_T_{c}_ copper oxygen perovskite superconductors, which are associated with the growth of antiferromagnetic spin correlations at low temperatures. Below _T_{c}_, _T_{1}^{-1}_ of the fractional Co at the octahedral B site, which increases from \sim0% at 0.65_T_{c}_ to \sim30% at 0.5_T_{c}_, shows a rapid decrease, indicating a partial formation of the superconducting energy gap. On the other hand, _T_{1}^{-1}_ of the dominant part of Co follows a Korringa-like relation down to 0.5_T_{c}_, suggesting it is in a gapless superconducting state, probably due to strong antiferromagnetic spin correlations.

## Introduction

The possible incidence of magnetism, particularly the role played by antiferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuations, on superconductivity and on normal-state properties has received wide interest in the study of the high-_T_{c}_ copper oxygen perovskite superconductors (HTSC). In AF insulators, the configuration of Cu^{2+} ions in the CuO_{2} layers is 3_d^{9}_ (_S_ = j) and the ground state is well described by two-dimensional (2D) Heisenberg model.[1] By hole doping into the CuO_{2} planes, long-range AF order is destroyed and the system translates into a superconducting (SC) state.[2] Our current interest is focused on the experimental analysis of the proximity of the AF and SC phase.

On the other hand, extensive work on SC material research for copper sulfides has been done and, recently, Miyatani, Ishikawa, and Tanaka[3] found that most of the copper sulfide spinels and stannites, in which the Cu atoms are in the Cu^{2+} (3_d^{9}_) ionic state, show SC or superconductorlike behavior. They suggested that the origin of the observed SC can be attributed to the Cu-S bonds or to Cu-S defects similar to the case of Cu-O bonds in HTSC. Among the copper chalcogenide spinels, Cu_{1+x}Co_{2-x}S_{4} (Ref. [4]) is interesting because it has a Curie-Weiss-type susceptibility with an AF behavior below _T_{N}_; this is shown in Fig. 1(a) and a SC transition at the lower temperature _T_{c}_, which largely depends on x, as the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity is shown in Fig. 1(b).

In the case of the stoichiometric spinel CuCo2S4 (_x_ = 0), an x-ray-diffraction (XRD) intensity analysis suggests that it is a normal spinel. The Cu and Co atoms occupy the tetrahedral A site and the octahedral B site, respectively, and the ionic distribution is given by Cu^{2+}[Co_{2}^{3+}]S_{4}. From temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility _kh_(_T_), the effective Bohr magneton _m_{\rm eff}_ was estimated to be 0.985 _m_{B}_/Cu. Taking the metallic _p_-type conductivity into consideration,[5] the Cu^{2+}(3_d^{9}_)-S bonds provide the 3d hole band like the case of HTSC. The Co^{3+} (3_d^{9}_) ions take a low spin configuration (_S_ = 0) as is explained from the NMR studies of Co in Co3S4.[6, 7]

In the case of Cu1.5Co1.5S4 (_x_ = 0.5), the effect of additional Cu atoms is believed, from the XRD analysis, to substitute for the Co atoms at the B site, and the ionic distribution is given by Cu^{2+}[Cu_{0.5}^{2+}Co_{1.5}^{3+}]S_{4-s}. The Curie-Weiss-type susceptibility becomes more pronounced, as is shown in Fig. 1(a), and _T_{N}_ increases from 17.5 K for x = 0 to 19.0 K for x = 0.5. A measurement of resistivity showed a SC transition at a low temperature, which took zero resistivity at _T_{c}_ = 2.3 K, as is shown in Fig. 1(b). The electrical resistivity in the normal state obeys the quadratic law \rho(T) = \rho_{0} + A T^{2} at low temperatures,[8] suggesting that strong electron correlations or spin correlations play an important role in the normal state. Thus, we expect a possible coexistence of a prominent antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in the present thiospinel Cu1.5Co1.5S4.

In this paper, we report briefly the results of a nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) study of ^{63}Cu and ^{59}Co and a pure-quadrupole-resonance (PQR) study of ^{59}Co in a poly crystalline specimen of Cu1.5Co1.5S4. The NMR has been known to be a useful tool for microscopic investigations of the magnetic and SC properties of HTSC [9, 10], in which AF correlations in the normal state were inferred from the large enhancement of the nuclear magnetic relaxation rate (_T_1_T_)^{-1} observed at Cu sites. The symmetry of the SC wave function was inferred from the _T_-dependence of T1 in the SC state [11].

Present experimental T1 data of both 63Cu and 59Co also show the existence of significant (_T_1_T_)^{-1} enhancements in the normal state near _T_c. The T1 data of 59Co in the SC state measured by PQR under a zero external magnetic field show a partial formation of the SC gap at the B sites. The T dependence of T1, however, is not simply explained within the framework of the conventional BCS model, nor is it an analogy of T1^{-1} behavior commonly observed in HTSC.

_Experiment._ The polycrystalline specimen of Cu1.5Co1.5 S4 [_T_c(onset) = 4.0 K, _T_c(_r_ = 0) = 2.3 K, T_{N} = 19.0 K] used in the present resonance study was synthesized by a standard vacuum shielded ampoule method. The XRD measurements gave the lattice constant a = 9.470 A and u parameter 0.390. The magnetization measurement showed that the Meissner effect begins below _T_c(onset) = 4.0 K and presents ~100% diamagnetism at ~2.8 K [4]. The value of _H_C1 and _H_C2 at 1.4 K was ~0.10 kOe and ~10 kOe, respectively.

The NMR and PQR experiments were carried out using a phase-coherent spin-echo spectrometer operating at 75 and 5-7 MHz, respectively. Displayed in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) are NMR spectra of 59Co and 63Cu in Cu1.5Co1.5S4 obtained at 4.2 K and 75 MHz in a field sweeping procedure. PQR spectra were also observed around 5.6 MHz in a zero magnetic field. Figure 2(c) shows 59Co PQR spectrum obtained at 4.2 K.

The NMR spectrum of 59Co (_I_ = \frac{3}{2}) shows a typical quadrupolar powder pattern attributed to the local trigonal symmetry at the octahedral B site. The value of the 59Co Knight shift, K [59], and the quadrupole frequency, \nu_{Q}^{59} = e^{2}qQ/14h, deduced from the spectrum is +1.43% and 1.86 MHz, respectively, and they hardly depend on T1 in the measured range of 4.2-150 K within our experimental uncertainty. In the case of the PQR spectrum, the main resonance line at 5.6 MHz can be assigned to the \mid + \frac{3}{2}\mid + \frac{5}{2}\mid transition (3 \nu_{Q}) of the 59Co spin levels at the B site. A weak 59Co resonance signal [hereafter labeled Co(II)], both in the PQR (at 6.3 MHz) and in the NMR (_K_ = 1.92%, \nu_{Q} = 2.10 MHz), was also observed. This spurious 59Co(II) signal depends on the sample preparation procedures and reaches minimal (<10%) intensity for a specimen with the highest _T_c(_x_ = 0.5) and maximum Meissner fraction (~100%).

The NMR spectrum of 63Cu (_I_ = \frac{3}{2}) shown in Fig. 2(b) indicates a superposed structure with a sharp strong main line and a broad weak line. The main line lacks the quadrupole structure. Most of the observed 63Cu signal is then attributed to the Cu atoms at the A sites, which have a local cubic symmetry. The broad and weak resonance line would be attributed to the quadrupolar broadened spectrum of the 63Cu atoms in the octahedral B site with the local trigonal symmetry.

The Knight shift of 63Cu, K [63], shows a slight temperature dependence as shown in Fig. 3, and takes a negative sign at low T (<25 K). The negative sign of K [63] is indicative of a dominant d core-polarization hyperfine coupling between the nuclear and electron spins. These results of both K [59] and K [63] in Cu1.5Co1.5S4 are close to those in CuCo2S4 as ob

  tained by the cw NMR measurement by Locher.[6] From the K^{63}(T) vs \chi(T) plot shown in the inset of Fig. 3, the d-spin hyperfine coupling constant A_{\rm hf}^{63}(d) for the Cu atoms at the A site is estimated to be -0.40 \pm 0.1 kOe/\mu_{B} , using the following relation:

\[A_{\rm hf}^{63}(d) = N\mu_{B}\,d\,K^{63}(T)/d\chi(T)\ \ ,\] (1)

where N is the number of the Cu atoms at the A site per gram.

The spin-lattice relaxation time T_{1} was measured utilizing the single-rf-pulse-saturation method. The magnetization recovery at the time t_{\rm s}M(t), after the saturation-rf-comb-pulses is given by[12, 13]

\[[M(\infty) - M(t)]/M(\infty) = a_{1}e^{-b_{1}t/T_{1}}+a_{2}^{-b_{2}t/T_{1}}\] (2) \[+a_{3}e^{-b_{3}t/T_{1}}+a_{4}e^{-b_{4}t/T_{1}},\]

where the coefficients b_{i} depend on the observed transition levels, and a_{i} on the initial saturation condition imposed on all the spin levels. In the present initial condition of single \pi/2 saturation pulse, b_{i} and a_{i} are given by b_{1} = 1, b_{2} = 6, b_{3} = 0, b_{4} = 0; a_{1} = 0.1, a_{1} = 0.9, a_{3} = 0, a_{4} = 0 for central \left|\frac{1}{2}\right\rangle\leftrightarrow\left|-\frac{1}{2}\right\rangle transition of Cu NMR, b_{1} = 1, b_{2} = 6, b_{3} = 15, b_{4} = 28; a_{1} = 0.013, a_{2} = 0.068, a_{3} = 0.206, a_{4} = 0.714 for central \left|\frac{1}{2}\right\rangle\leftrightarrow\left|-\frac{1}{2}\right\rangle transition of Co NMR and b_{1} = 3, b_{2} = 10, b_{3} = 21, b_{4} = 0.214, a_{2} = 0.649, a_{3} = 0.136, a_{4} = 0 for \left|\frac{1}{2}\right\rangle\leftrightarrow\left|+\frac{5}{2}\right\rangle transition of Co PQR, respectively.

The experimental recovery data of both ^{63}Cu and ^{59}Co NMR, however, could not be reproduced by Eq. (2) with a corresponding set of coefficients. It is tentatively assumed, to explain the recovery, that the observed magnetization M(t) is composed of two components: M_{f} with fast relaxation rate T_{1(t)}^{-1} and M_{s} with slow rates T_{1(s)}^{-1} . We obtained a satisfactory fit with the following equation:

\[\frac{[M(\infty) - M(t)]}{M(\infty)} = M_{f}{\sum\limits_{i}}\ \ a_{i}e^{-b_{i}t/T_{1(t)}} + M_{s}{\sum\limits_{i}}\ \ a_{i}e^{-b_{i}t/T_{1(s)}},\] (3)

where M_{f} + M_{s} = 1. The M_{f} corresponding to the fraction with the fast relaxation rate T_{1(f)}^{-1} was estimated to be \sim 70% for  _Discussion._ The bulk magnetic susceptibility \chi(T) of Cu_{1.5}Co_{1.5}S_{4} has the Curie-Weiss-type paramagnetism with the AF peak at 19.0 K, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The present results of the linear dependence of the negative K^{63}(T) on \chi(T) and of the nearly T independent K^{59} in Cu_{1.5}Co_{1.5}S_{4} indicate that the 3d hole band of Cu at the A site is mainly responsible for the spin paramagnetism. The (T_{1}T)^{-1} of both ^{63}Cu and ^{59}Co is significantly enhanced at low T, but the divergence behavior of T_{1}^{-1} at \simT_{N} expected in the weak-titemant AF substances was not observed. This is consistent with the results of specific heat measurement, which did not reveal any anomalies around T_{N}.[14] These results indicate that any long-range AF orders are not established below \sim 19 K.

Two characteristic results are obtained in the NMR experiment for the copper thiospinel Cu_{1.5}Co_{1.5}S_{4}: (i) very weak T dependence of K^{63} and nearly T-independent K^{59}, (ii) significant (T_{1}T)^{-1} enhancements near T_{c}. These results agree qualitatively with those observed for the over hole-doped copper perovskite HTSC of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (Ref. 9) and YBa_{2.5}Cu_{3.0} (Ref. 10). The unusual Cu relaxation behavior in HTSC, associated with the growth of AF spin correlations, is the subject of great interest and has been extensively studied. The essential point is that, as the (T_{1}T)^{-1} is expressed in terms of the dynamical spin susceptibility,

\[(T_{1}T)^{-1}\!=\!\frac{\gamma^{2}k_{B}}{2\,\mu_{B}^{2}}\!\sum_{q}\frac{A_{q}^ {2}\!\!\!{\rm Im}\chi_{q}(\omega)}{\omega}\,,\] (4)

a growth of the staggered susceptibility \chi_{Q}(T) at the zone boundary is responsible for the large (T_{1}T)^{-1} enhancement, where Q\!=\!(\pi/2,\pi/2) for the square lattice of HTSC.

Thus we may consider that the AF spin correlations play an important role on the magnetism and the SC formation not only in HTSC but also in Cu_{1.5}Co_{1.5}S_{4}, although there seems no evident structural resemblance between the thiospinel and HTSC. It is worth to mention that a non-SC compound of CuCo_{2}S_{4}, on the other hand, did not reveal such a considerable amount of enhancement in (T_{1}T)^{-1} in our preliminary ^{59}Co PQR study.

The T dependence of T_{1} below T_{c} for the conventional BCS superconductors is well established:[15] the isotropic SC energy gap \Delta is opened at the Fermi level below T_{c}. This causes a T_{1}^{-1} enhancement (BCS coherence peak) just below T_{c} and an exponential decrease at lower T. The magnitude of the BCS coherence peak is known to be diminished when anisotropy of the energy gap \delta\Delta exists and/or the external magnetic field is applied. In the case of HTSC, on the other hand, the behavior of T_{1} in the SC state has converged as follows: T_{1}^{-1} decreases rapidly just below T_{c} without the BCS coherence peak, but exhibits different behavior at lower T in each case.

In the present case of Cu_{1.5}Co_{1.5}S_{4}, the experimental T dependence of T_{1} of ^{59}Co below T_{c} is not simply explained within the framework of the conventional BCS model, nor is it an analogy of the T_{1}^{-1} behavior in HTSC. T_{1}^{-1} of the dominant fraction of Co at the B sites follows roughly the (T_{1}T)^{-1}\!\simeq\!1.5 (sK)^{-1} relation down to 1.23 K, in spite of the fact that T_{1} was measured under zero external magnetic field. T_{1}^{-1} of the partial fraction of Co appeared below \sim\!0.65T_{c} , however, shows a rapid decrease, providing evidence for the partial formation of the SC energy gap. As the Meissner effect emerges below T_{c}(onset)\,\sim\!4.0 K and presents \sim\!100% diamagnetism at 1.23 K, we may consider that the dominant part of the specimen is in a gapless SC state down to 1.23 K, possibly caused by the strong AF spin correlations. However it cannot be ruled out the possibility that a considerable part of the specimen is still in the normal state down to 1.23 K because there is a case in which \sim\!100% diamagnetism does not correspond to the perfect Meissner effect. Further experimental study and analysis of the T_{1} behavior in the SC state at lower temperatures and of the dependence of the (T_{1}T)^{-1} enhancement on the Cu substitution content x are in progress.

###### Abstract

The antiferromagnetic and superconducting properties of a thiospinel Cu1.5Co1.5S4 (_T_{N}_ = 19.0 K, _T_{c}_ = 2.3 K) have been investigated with ^{63}Cu NMR (75 MHz), ^{59}Co NMR (75 MHz), and ^{59}Co pure quadrupole resonance between T = 1.23 and 150 K. The linear dependence of negative ^{63}Cu Knight shift (- 0.013% at 4.2 K) on the Curie-Weiss-type susceptibility (_X_T_) and nearly independent ^{59}Co Knight shift (+1.43%) indicate that the d hole band of Cu at the tetrahedral A site is mainly responsible for the spin paramagnetism. The spin-lattice relaxation rates (_T_1_T_)^{-1} of both ^{63}Cu and ^{59}Co are significantly enhanced with lowering temperature below \sim 100 K, similar to those observed in high-_T_{c}_ copper oxygen perovskite superconductors, which are associated with the growth of antiferromagnetic spin correlations at low temperatures. Below _T_{c}_, _T_{1}^{-1}_ of the fractional Co at the octahedral B site, which increases from \sim0% at 0.65_T_{c}_ to \sim30% at 0.5_T_{c}_, shows a rapid decrease, indicating a partial formation of the superconducting energy gap. On the other hand, _T_{1}^{-1}_ of the dominant part of Co follows a Korringa-like relation down to 0.5_T_{c}_, suggesting it is in a gapless superconducting state, probably due to strong antiferromagnetic spin correlations.

## Introduction

The possible incidence of magnetism, particularly the role played by antiferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuations, on superconductivity and on normal-state properties has received wide interest in the study of the high-_T_{c}_ copper oxygen perovskite superconductors (HTSC). In AF insulators, the configuration of Cu^{2+} ions in the CuO_{2} layers is 3_d^{9}_ (_S_ = j) and the ground state is well described by two-dimensional (2D) Heisenberg model.[1] By hole doping into the CuO_{2} planes, long-range AF order is destroyed and the system translates into a superconducting (SC) state.[2] Our current interest is focused on the experimental analysis of the proximity of the AF and SC phase.

On the other hand, extensive work on SC material research for copper sulfides has been done and, recently, Miyatani, Ishikawa, and Tanaka[3] found that most of the copper sulfide spinels and stannites, in which the Cu atoms are in the Cu^{2+} (3_d^{9}_) ionic state, show SC or superconductorlike behavior. They suggested that the origin of the observed SC can be attributed to the Cu-S bonds or to Cu-S defects similar to the case of Cu-O bonds in HTSC. Among the copper chalcogenide spinels, Cu_{1+x}Co_{2-x}S_{4} (Ref. [4]) is interesting because it has a Curie-Weiss-type susceptibility with an AF behavior below _T_{N}_; this is shown in Fig. 1(a) and a SC transition at the lower temperature _T_{c}_, which largely depends on x, as the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity is shown in Fig. 1(b).

In the case of the stoichiometric spinel CuCo2S4 (_x_ = 0), an x-ray-diffraction (XRD) intensity analysis suggests that it is a normal spinel. The Cu and Co atoms occupy the tetrahedral A site and the octahedral B site, respectively, and the ionic distribution is given by Cu^{2+}[Co_{2}^{3+}]S_{4}. From temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility _kh_(_T_), the effective Bohr magneton _m_{\rm eff}_ was estimated to be 0.985 _m_{B}_/Cu. Taking the metallic _p_-type conductivity into consideration,[5] the Cu^{2+}(3_d^{9}_)-S bonds provide the 3d hole band like the case of HTSC. The Co^{3+} (3_d^{9}_) ions take a low spin configuration (_S_ = 0) as is explained from the NMR studies of Co in Co3S4.[6, 7]

In the case of Cu1.5Co1.5S4 (_x_ = 0.5), the effect of additional Cu atoms is believed, from the XRD analysis, to substitute for the Co atoms at the B site, and the ionic distribution is given by Cu^{2+}[Cu_{0.5}^{2+}Co_{1.5}^{3+}]S_{4-s}. The Curie-Weiss-type susceptibility becomes more pronounced, as is shown in Fig. 1(a), and _T_{N}_ increases from 17.5 K for x = 0 to 19.0 K for x = 0.5. A measurement of resistivity showed a SC transition at a low temperature, which took zero resistivity at _T_{c}_ = 2.3 K, as is shown in Fig. 1(b). The electrical resistivity in the normal state obeys the quadratic law \rho(T) = \rho_{0} + A T^{2} at low temperatures,[8] suggesting that strong electron correlations or spin correlations play an important role in the normal state. Thus, we expect a possible coexistence of a prominent antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in the present thiospinel Cu1.5Co1.5S4.

In this paper, we report briefly the results of a nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) study of ^{63}Cu and ^{59}Co and a pure-quadrupole-resonance (PQR) study of ^{59}Co in a poly crystalline specimen of Cu1.5Co1.5S4. The NMR has been known to be a useful tool for microscopic investigations of the magnetic and SC properties of HTSC [9, 10], in which AF correlations in the normal state were inferred from the large enhancement of the nuclear magnetic relaxation rate (_T_1_T_)^{-1} observed at Cu sites. The symmetry of the SC wave function was inferred from the _T_-dependence of T1 in the SC state [11].

Present experimental T1 data of both 63Cu and 59Co also show the existence of significant (_T_1_T_)^{-1} enhancements in the normal state near _T_c. The T1 data of 59Co in the SC state measured by PQR under a zero external magnetic field show a partial formation of the SC gap at the B sites. The T dependence of T1, however, is not simply explained within the framework of the conventional BCS model, nor is it an analogy of T1^{-1} behavior commonly observed in HTSC.

_Experiment._ The polycrystalline specimen of Cu1.5Co1.5 S4 [_T_c(onset) = 4.0 K, _T_c(_r_ = 0) = 2.3 K, T_{N} = 19.0 K] used in the present resonance study was synthesized by a standard vacuum shielded ampoule method. The XRD measurements gave the lattice constant a = 9.470 A and u parameter 0.390. The magnetization measurement showed that the Meissner effect begins below _T_c(onset) = 4.0 K and presents ~100% diamagnetism at ~2.8 K [4]. The value of _H_C1 and _H_C2 at 1.4 K was ~0.10 kOe and ~10 kOe, respectively.

The NMR and PQR experiments were carried out using a phase-coherent spin-echo spectrometer operating at 75 and 5-7 MHz, respectively. Displayed in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) are NMR spectra of 59Co and 63Cu in Cu1.5Co1.5S4 obtained at 4.2 K and 75 MHz in a field sweeping procedure. PQR spectra were also observed around 5.6 MHz in a zero magnetic field. Figure 2(c) shows 59Co PQR spectrum obtained at 4.2 K.

The NMR spectrum of 59Co (_I_ = \frac{3}{2}) shows a typical quadrupolar powder pattern attributed to the local trigonal symmetry at the octahedral B site. The value of the 59Co Knight shift, K [59], and the quadrupole frequency, \nu_{Q}^{59} = e^{2}qQ/14h, deduced from the spectrum is +1.43% and 1.86 MHz, respectively, and they hardly depend on T1 in the measured range of 4.2-150 K within our experimental uncertainty. In the case of the PQR spectrum, the main resonance line at 5.6 MHz can be assigned to the \mid + \frac{3}{2}\mid + \frac{5}{2}\mid transition (3 \nu_{Q}) of the 59Co spin levels at the B site. A weak 59Co resonance signal [hereafter labeled Co(II)], both in the PQR (at 6.3 MHz) and in the NMR (_K_ = 1.92%, \nu_{Q} = 2.10 MHz), was also observed. This spurious 59Co(II) signal depends on the sample preparation procedures and reaches minimal (<10%) intensity for a specimen with the highest _T_c(_x_ = 0.5) and maximum Meissner fraction (~100%).

The NMR spectrum of 63Cu (_I_ = \frac{3}{2}) shown in Fig. 2(b) indicates a superposed structure with a sharp strong main line and a broad weak line. The main line lacks the quadrupole structure. Most of the observed 63Cu signal is then attributed to the Cu atoms at the A sites, which have a local cubic symmetry. The broad and weak resonance line would be attributed to the quadrupolar broadened spectrum of the 63Cu atoms in the octahedral B site with the local trigonal symmetry.

The Knight shift of 63Cu, K [63], shows a slight temperature dependence as shown in Fig. 3, and takes a negative sign at low T (<25 K). The negative sign of K [63] is indicative of a dominant d core-polarization hyperfine coupling between the nuclear and electron spins. These results of both K [59] and K [63] in Cu1.5Co1.5S4 are close to those in CuCo2S4 as ob

  tained by the cw NMR measurement by Locher.[6] From the K^{63}(T) vs \chi(T) plot shown in the inset of Fig. 3, the d-spin hyperfine coupling constant A_{\rm hf}^{63}(d) for the Cu atoms at the A site is estimated to be -0.40 \pm 0.1 kOe/\mu_{B} , using the following relation:

\[A_{\rm hf}^{63}(d) = N\mu_{B}\,d\,K^{63}(T)/d\chi(T)\ \ ,\] (1)

where N is the number of the Cu atoms at the A site per gram.

The spin-lattice relaxation time T_{1} was measured utilizing the single-rf-pulse-saturation method. The magnetization recovery at the time t_{\rm s}M(t), after the saturation-rf-comb-pulses is given by[12, 13]

\[[M(\infty) - M(t)]/M(\infty) = a_{1}e^{-b_{1}t/T_{1}}+a_{2}^{-b_{2}t/T_{1}}\] (2) \[+a_{3}e^{-b_{3}t/T_{1}}+a_{4}e^{-b_{4}t/T_{1}},\]

where the coefficients b_{i} depend on the observed transition levels, and a_{i} on the initial saturation condition imposed on all the spin levels. In the present initial condition of single \pi/2 saturation pulse, b_{i} and a_{i} are given by b_{1} = 1, b_{2} = 6, b_{3} = 0, b_{4} = 0; a_{1} = 0.1, a_{1} = 0.9, a_{3} = 0, a_{4} = 0 for central \left|\frac{1}{2}\right\rangle\leftrightarrow\left|-\frac{1}{2}\right\rangle transition of Cu NMR, b_{1} = 1, b_{2} = 6, b_{3} = 15, b_{4} = 28; a_{1} = 0.013, a_{2} = 0.068, a_{3} = 0.206, a_{4} = 0.714 for central \left|\frac{1}{2}\right\rangle\leftrightarrow\left|-\frac{1}{2}\right\rangle transition of Co NMR and b_{1} = 3, b_{2} = 10, b_{3} = 21, b_{4} = 0.214, a_{2} = 0.649, a_{3} = 0.136, a_{4} = 0 for \left|\frac{1}{2}\right\rangle\leftrightarrow\left|+\frac{5}{2}\right\rangle transition of Co PQR, respectively.

The experimental recovery data of both ^{63}Cu and ^{59}Co NMR, however, could not be reproduced by Eq. (2) with a corresponding set of coefficients. It is tentatively assumed, to explain the recovery, that the observed magnetization M(t) is composed of two components: M_{f} with fast relaxation rate T_{1(t)}^{-1} and M_{s} with slow rates T_{1(s)}^{-1} . We obtained a satisfactory fit with the following equation:

\[\frac{[M(\infty) - M(t)]}{M(\infty)} = M_{f}{\sum\limits_{i}}\ \ a_{i}e^{-b_{i}t/T_{1(t)}} + M_{s}{\sum\limits_{i}}\ \ a_{i}e^{-b_{i}t/T_{1(s)}},\] (3)

where M_{f} + M_{s} = 1. The M_{f} corresponding to the fraction with the fast relaxation rate T_{1(f)}^{-1} was estimated to be \sim 70% for  _Discussion._ The bulk magnetic susceptibility \chi(T) of Cu_{1.5}Co_{1.5}S_{4} has the Curie-Weiss-type paramagnetism with the AF peak at 19.0 K, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The present results of the linear dependence of the negative K^{63}(T) on \chi(T) and of the nearly T independent K^{59} in Cu_{1.5}Co_{1.5}S_{4} indicate that the 3d hole band of Cu at the A site is mainly responsible for the spin paramagnetism. The (T_{1}T)^{-1} of both ^{63}Cu and ^{59}Co is significantly enhanced at low T, but the divergence behavior of T_{1}^{-1} at \simT_{N} expected in the weak-titemant AF substances was not observed. This is consistent with the results of specific heat measurement, which did not reveal any anomalies around T_{N}.[14] These results indicate that any long-range AF orders are not established below \sim 19 K.

Two characteristic results are obtained in the NMR experiment for the copper thiospinel Cu_{1.5}Co_{1.5}S_{4}: (i) very weak T dependence of K^{63} and nearly T-independent K^{59}, (ii) significant (T_{1}T)^{-1} enhancements near T_{c}. These results agree qualitatively with those observed for the over hole-doped copper perovskite HTSC of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (Ref. 9) and YBa_{2.5}Cu_{3.0} (Ref. 10). The unusual Cu relaxation behavior in HTSC, associated with the growth of AF spin correlations, is the subject of great interest and has been extensively studied. The essential point is that, as the (T_{1}T)^{-1} is expressed in terms of the dynamical spin susceptibility,

\[(T_{1}T)^{-1}\!=\!\frac{\gamma^{2}k_{B}}{2\,\mu_{B}^{2}}\!\sum_{q}\frac{A_{q}^ {2}\!\!\!{\rm Im}\chi_{q}(\omega)}{\omega}\,,\] (4)

a growth of the staggered susceptibility \chi_{Q}(T) at the zone boundary is responsible for the large (T_{1}T)^{-1} enhancement, where Q\!=\!(\pi/2,\pi/2) for the square lattice of HTSC.

Thus we may consider that the AF spin correlations play an important role on the magnetism and the SC formation not only in HTSC but also in Cu_{1.5}Co_{1.5}S_{4}, although there seems no evident structural resemblance between the thiospinel and HTSC. It is worth to mention that a non-SC compound of CuCo_{2}S_{4}, on the other hand, did not reveal such a considerable amount of enhancement in (T_{1}T)^{-1} in our preliminary ^{59}Co PQR study.

The T dependence of T_{1} below T_{c} for the conventional BCS superconductors is well established:[15] the isotropic SC energy gap \Delta is opened at the Fermi level below T_{c}. This causes a T_{1}^{-1} enhancement (BCS coherence peak) just below T_{c} and an exponential decrease at lower T. The magnitude of the BCS coherence peak is known to be diminished when anisotropy of the energy gap \delta\Delta exists and/or the external magnetic field is applied. In the case of HTSC, on the other hand, the behavior of T_{1} in the SC state has converged as follows: T_{1}^{-1} decreases rapidly just below T_{c} without the BCS coherence peak, but exhibits different behavior at lower T in each case.

In the present case of Cu_{1.5}Co_{1.5}S_{4}, the experimental T dependence of T_{1} of ^{59}Co below T_{c} is not simply explained within the framework of the conventional BCS model, nor is it an analogy of the T_{1}^{-1} behavior in HTSC. T_{1}^{-1} of the dominant fraction of Co at the B sites follows roughly the (T_{1}T)^{-1}\!\simeq\!1.5 (sK)^{-1} relation down to 1.23 K, in spite of the fact that T_{1} was measured under zero external magnetic field. T_{1}^{-1} of the partial fraction of Co appeared below \sim\!0.65T_{c} , however, shows a rapid decrease, providing evidence for the partial formation of the SC energy gap. As the Meissner effect emerges below T_{c}(onset)\,\sim\!4.0 K and presents \sim\!100% diamagnetism at 1.23 K, we may consider that the dominant part of the specimen is in a gapless SC state down to 1.23 K, possibly caused by the strong AF spin correlations. However it cannot be ruled out the possibility that a considerable part of the specimen is still in the normal state down to 1.23 K because there is a case in which \sim\!100% diamagnetism does not correspond to the perfect Meissner effect. Further experimental study and analysis of the T_{1} behavior in the SC state at lower temperatures and of the dependence of the (T_{1}T)^{-1} enhancement on the Cu substitution content x are in progress.
