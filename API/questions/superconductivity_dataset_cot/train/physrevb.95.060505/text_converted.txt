###### Abstract

We use neutron diffraction and muon spin relaxation to study the effect
of in-plane uniaxial pressure on the antiferromagnetic (AF) orthorhombic
phase in BaFe₂As₂ and its Co- and Ni-substituted members near optimal
superconductivity. In the low-temperature AF ordered state, uniaxial
pressure necessary to defwin the orthorhombic crystals also increases
the magnetic ordered moment, reaching an 11

Understanding the behavior of magnetism in iron superconductors
continues to be an important topic in modern condensed matter physics
because spin excitations may mediate electron pairing for
high-temperature superconductivity [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Some of the
earliest work in this field determined that iron pnictides such as
LaFeAsO [1, 2] and BaFe₂As₂ [Figs. (a) and (b)] [3, 4, 5] form static
stripe antiferromagnetic (AF) order at T_(N), preceded by a
tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition of the lattice at T_(s)
(T_(N)≤T_(s)≤ 300 K). While AF order may be a spin-density wave (SDW)
from nesting of hole and electron Fermi surfaces at the Γ and X points
in the one-iron Brillouin zone [Figs. (c) and (d)], respectively [8, 9,
10, 11], it may also originate from localized moments on individual Fe
sites [12, 13, 14, 15].

Upon hole doping to form Ba_(1 − x)Na_(x)Fe₂As₂, a magnetically ordered
state with restored tetragonal symmetry is found near optimal
superconductivity, replacing the stripe AF ordered state [16, 17].
Mossbauer spectroscopy experiments find real-space modulation of
magnetic moments on Fe sites, thus conclusively establishing that the
magnetic order with tetragonal symmetry is a SDW from itinerant
electrons [18]. For electron-doped BaFe_(2 − x)T_(x)As₂ (T = Co, Ni),
long-range commensurate stripe magnetic order in BaFe₂As₂ evolves into
short-range incommensurate magnetic order near optimal superconductivity
[19, 20], due possibly to a SDW order [19] or a cluster spin glass [21,
22, 23]. While these results suggest a rich variety of magnetic ground
states for superconducting iron pnictides, nematic order has recently
been identified as a unifying feature near optimal superconductivity,
seen via the resistivity anisotropy induced by in-plane mechanical
strain [24]. Since nematic order couples linearly to anisotropic strain
of the same symmetry [25, 26], a determination of the effect of uniaxial
pressure on magnetism of iron pnictides should reveal the observed
nematic susceptibility [24] as associated with magnetic order and spin
excitations.

Without uniaxial strain, BaFe_(2 − x)T_(x)As₂ forms twinned domains in
the orthorhombic state, with AF Bragg reflections occurring at (±1.0,L)
and (0. ± 1,L) (L = 1,3,5, ...) [7]. Uniaxial pressure has been used to
mechanically defwin single crystals by compressing along one axis of the
orthorhombic lattice, creating a preferred orientation for microscopic
domains [27, 28, 29]. However, even the modest amount of pressure
necessary for detwinning (∼10 MPa) also induces a significant (∼1-2 K)
upward shift of T_(N) in electron-doped BaFe₂As₂[30, 31, 32, 33, 34],
and changes T_(s) into a crossover with orthorhombic lattice distortion
at all temperatures [35]. One study combining a phenomenological
Ginsburg-Landau model with density functional theory (DFT) calculations
under uniaxial strain suggests that the magnetic ordered moment of
BaFe₂As₂ decreases under pressure [36]. While previous neutron
scattering experiments suggested this to be the case [30, 31], only
(±1, 0, L) was measured and it is unclear how the combined magnetic
signal at (±1, 0, L) and (0, ±1, L) evolve with applied pressure.
Moreover, the bulk-averaged nature of neutron measurements cannot
distinguish a change in magnetic volume fraction from a changing ordered
moment. To conclusively determine the effect of uniaxial strain on
magnetic order, one must combine neutron scattering with a probe such as
muon spin relaxation (μSR) [37, 38].

In this Rapid Communication, we use neutron diffraction, μSR, and
combined DFT and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) calculations [Figs.
1(f)-1(h)] [39, 40] to study the effect of uniaxial pressure on the AF
phase transition in BaFe_(2 − x)T_(x)As₂. In BaFe₂As₂, the sample
achieves nearly 100

For our combined DFT and DMFT calculations in the collinear AF state, we
use the experimental crystal structure and the same Coulomb interactions
used previously for BaFe₂As₂[39, 40]. We find that uniaxial strain does
indeed enhance the ordered moment for BaFe_(1.915)Ni_(0.085)As₂ (Fig.
3), and that the effect becomes larger for samples close to optimal
superconductivity. The inset in Fig. 1(f) shows the dependence of the
ordered magnetic moment on doping (x) and distortion
[δ = (a − b)/(a + b)], which supports a much larger increase

of the magnetic moment in the doped compounds for fixed δ = 0.38%,
corresponding to about 30 MPa in the parent compound. In Fig. 1(f), we
fix the distortion δ = 0.0013 corresponding to about 10 MPa in the
parent compound [35], and plot the ordered moment with (M at a > b) and
without uniaxial pressure (M₀ at a = b). Using these results, in Fig.
1(g) we define a susceptibility
χ = [(M − M₀)/(M + M₀)]/[(a − b)/(a + b)], which is small in the parent
compound but shows diverging behavior near x = 0.1 (dashed line).
Because fixing the distortion δ = 0.0013 corresponds to a greater
applied uniaxial pressure for the doped samples due to the larger bulk
modulus in those compounds [26], the overplotted experimental points
from neutron and μSR measurements may underestimate the moment increase
relative to the calculated points. Nevertheless, we find a clear
similarity between the theoretical and experimental results, implying
that the divergence of the nematic susceptibility [24] has a magnetic
origin.

where Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) show the AF unit cell and Bragg peak positions

pressure along the b-axis direction of the orthorhombic structure, the

become extinguished [red and blue dots in Fig. 1(b)] [30; 31; 32; 33].
The striped brown boxes in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) represent the
low-temperature magnetic unit cell and its equivalent area in Q space,
while in green we show the configurations for a single Fe ion [11].

Figure 2 summarizes our experimental results on the uniaxial pressure
effect in BaFe₂As₂. In Figs. 2(c) and 2(d), we show how the Bragg peak
intensity becomes redistributed from the weak side
[Q_(weak) = (0, ±1, L)] to the strong side [Q_(strong) = (±1, 0, L)],
resulting in a near doubling of the strong reflection intensity [Fig.
2(a)] while the total intensity remains conserved [Fig. 2(b)].
Consistent with earlier work [30; 31], we find that pressure both
enhances and broadens the magnetic phase transition. The rocking curves
[Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)] at (1,0,5) and (0,1,5) were collected at INS at 90
K [34]. The pressure dependence of the detwinning ratio, defined as
η = (I₁₀ − I₀₁)/(I₁₀ + I₀₁), and total scattering intensity
I_(total) = (I₁₀ + I₀₁)/(I₁₀ + I₀₁)_(P = 0) from both experiments are
also included in Fig. 2(b), which shows a very small reduction in
I_(total) between 0 and 5 MPa. Figures 2(e) and 2(f) show the effect of
pressure on the magnetic ordering temperature [11].

Figure 3 summarizes the uniaxial pressure dependence in
BaFe_(1.915)Ni_(0.085)As₂. In a twinned sample, the elastic magnetic
scattering intensity at (1,0,3) should be equal to that at (0,1,3),
ignoring absorption and other instrumentation effects [11]. If magnetic
moments do not react to the applied uniaxial pressure, one would expect
the scattering intensity for a fully detwinned sample to at most double
at the (1,0,3) position, such as in Fig. 2(a) for BaFe₂As₂. Figure 3(a)
shows this is not the case: The scattering intensity at 20 K rises by a
factor of ∼2.5 from 0 to 40 MPa. Considering the detwinning effect, this
corresponds to a 25

To disentangle the magnetic volume fraction from the ordered moment in
BaFe_(1.915)Ni_(0.085)As₂, we carried out μSR measurements using the
same crystal and under the same conditions [11]. We implanted muons with
the spin polarization along the sample a axis and observed fast
relaxation due to a buildup of the static internal magnetic field. From
the zero field (ZF)-μSR time spectra in Ref. [11], we obtained the fast
relaxation rate λ in Fig. 3(g), which is linearly proportional to the
size of the local static magnetic moment (M), together with the volume
fraction V_(M) of magnetically ordered regions in Fig. 3(h). In addition
to confirming the pressure-induced T_(N) increase [Fig. 1(h)], we find
that the relaxation rates at T = 20 K and T = 3 K exhibit a ∼10

We carried out similar μSR measurements on BaFe_(1.9)Co_(0.1)As₂
(T_(N) = 70 K). In a ZF environment, we observe oscillations in the time
spectra that indicate the slope of long-range order, different from the
spectra in BaFe_(1.915)Ni_(0.085)As₂[11] where the larger doping leads
to significantly disordered magnetism [35; 37; 38; 44; 45; 46]. Assuming
two muon stopping sites in BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂[45], we fit the
short-time coherent relaxation with a two-cosine function, separately
fitting both frequencies for each temperature and uniaxial pressure,
while globally constraining the other free parameters such as relaxation
rates [11]. Figure 4(a) shows the uniaxial pressure evolution of the
fast cosine frequency in the muon decay time spectra [Fig. 4(b)] for
several temperatures. Although 2 K is below T_(c), the magnetic field
increases at least as much as at 25 K, indicating that the magnetic
phase may not be fully saturated at 25 K. To measure the magnetic volume
fraction [Fig. 4(c)], we apply a weak (30 G) external magnetic field in
order to clearly distinguish the fast-relaxing component from the long
paramagnetic oscillations. The ordered phase volume saturates below ∼65
K for all pressures,

portion of the muon decay asymmetry, for T = 2 K (superconducting), 25
K, and 45 K for BaFe_(1.9)Co_(0.1)As₂[11]. (b) Muon decay asymmetry at
25 K as a function of uniaxial pressure. The fraction of muons remaining

magnetic field, demonstrating a constant magnetic sample volume below
T_(N) = 65 K, as well as a broadening of the magnetic transition under
pressure and an increase in T_(N). (d) Data in (a) plotted as an order
parameter.

while for higher temperatures the magnetic transition is broadened
significantly for BaFe_(1.95)Co_(0.1)As₂ as it was with
BaFe_(1.915)Ni_(0.085)As₂ [Fig. 3(h)].

As the doping increases and the ordered magnetic moment correspondingly
decreases, it is natural to expect that quantum fluctuations, including
those related to a nematic quantum critical point [24], become
important. Here we have demonstrated that an in-plane symmetry-breaking
field is more effective in enhancing the ordered magnetic moment for
nearly optimally doped iron pnictides. The corresponding decrease in
T_(c) is consistent with the view that by slightly increasing the
orthorhombicity, the doped system effectively shifts leftward on the
phase diagram (toward the parent compound), and demonstrates that
in-plane lattice distortion is a mechanism by which magnetism directly
competes with superconductivity. Since the doped compounds react much
more sensitively to uniaxial pressure, the enhanced magnetic properties
demonstrate the sensitivity of magnetism to quantum fluctuations near
optimal superconductivity, suggesting that nematic order is associated
with both magnetism and optimal superconductivity in iron pnictides [24,
25].
