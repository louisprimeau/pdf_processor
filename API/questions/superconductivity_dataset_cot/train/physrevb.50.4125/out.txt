The magnetic behavior of the 71-K superconductor Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr4Cu2CO3O7, which consists of an intergrowth of the two nonsuperconducting phases Sr2CuO2CO3 and Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2CuO5, has been studied. Its pinning properties in terms of the critical current density _Jc_ and the irreversibility line have been established using a modified-Bean-model expression for the magnetization data and compared to results for other thallium cuprates. Typical _Jc_ was calculated to be ~8 x 106 A/cm2 at 5 K in a field of 0.2 T. The analysis of the reversible magnetization, leading to basic values of the parameters for this oxycarbonate as l0 = 170 nm, _g_m0 = 2.39 nm and k = 72.5, was also performed. The latter values are compared to other existing data especially those concerning the thallium-based superconductors which have been derived from similar analyses. This study shows that the superconducting behavior of this oxycarbonate is closer to multiple copper layered cuprates than to the single copper layer "1201" phase although carbonate groups connect two successive copper layers. It can be considered as intermediate between the thallium bilayer cuprates and the best lead-doped "1223" and "1212" superconductors.

## INTRODUCTION

The recent discovery of a series of superconductive copper oxycarbonates (see for a review Refs. 1 and 2), with _T_c's up to 80 K states the issue of the role of carbonate groups in superconductivity for these materials. This is especially the case of the 71-K superconductor Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr4Cu2CO3O7,3 which exhibits a rather sharp transition and a significant diamagnetic volume fraction of 65% in spite of the fact that its structure [Fig. 1(a)] consists of an intergrowth of two nonsuperconducting phases, Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2CuO5 (Refs. 4 and 5) and Sr2CuO2CO3.6-7 Thus, although this phase derives from that of the 1:2:0:1 cuprates [Fig. 1(b)] by replacing one [TiO]o layer out of two by rows of the carbonate groups, it appears as a much better superconductor.

A common feature of this oxycarbonate with the thallium cuprates deals with the anisotropy of its structure, which may induce, as in the latter a high anisotropy of its superconducting properties. The investigation of superconductivity in the thallium oxycarbonate is of capital importance, since it has been shown that the physical properties of most of the thallium cuprates exhibit low capacities to carry superconducting current at T > > 4.2 K, so that their potential applications are limited. In particular, the positions of the irreversibility lines of such materials in the _H_-_T_ plane are too low. Among the different thallium cuprates, it has been demonstrated that the monolayer ones exhibit better intrinsic pinning properties than the bilayers.8,9 A model, based on weak Josephson coupling of the CuO2 layers between the rock-salt-type layers, has been proposed to explain such a difference; it predicts that the irreversibility line is steepened when the thickness of the rock-salt-type layers decreases.8 This may also explain the relatively good intrinsic pinning properties of the lead-based monolayer cuprate Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca2Cu3O9 abbreviated "TIPb-1:2:2:3", 9-11

For these reasons we have investigated the superconducting properties of the "TIPb" oxycarbonate Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr4Cu2CO3O7. Magnetic measurements have been performed on the corresponding ceramic. Pinning properties and characteristic superconducting parameters are derived here. These results are compared with exist

 ing data on the different thallium-based superconducting cuprates, especially with data determined by magnetization measurements on polycrystalline samples.

## Experimental

A polycrystalline sample Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr4Cu2CO3O7 was prepared by the solid-state reaction method described in Ref. [3]. In this technique, the reaction is carried out in a silica ampoule in order to prevent thallium losses oxides and CO2. The resulting product is an almost pure phase with some traces of TlPb-1201 and SrCO3. As-synthesized samples are found to be superconductors with 20 K <= T_{c} <= 60 K and low-temperature annealings [290 degC in argon-hydrogen flow (H2 10%)] are performed in order to optimize T_{c}.3 The susceptibility versus temperature of the optimized compound in powder form is shown in Fig. 2.

In order to obtain basic superconducting parameters of this oxycarbonate, magnetic measurements were carried out using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer with field ranging from 0 to 5 T and temperature from 5 K to T_{c}. A pause of 600 s was applied after each magnetic-field settling when hysteresis loops were recorded in order to achieve good stability; a 2-cm scan length involving a small field inhomogeneity (0.1%) was chosen for the measurements. A capsule was filled with ~100 mg of oxycarbonate in powder form and fixed on the sample holder of the SQUID system. The mean size of the grains is 3 \mum as checked with a light-diffusion granulometer and the grains present plateletlike shapes as shown on the TEM microstructure of Fig. 3. The Curie-Weiss signal related to the impurities was measured above T_{c} to subtract from the experimental data. The diamagnetic volume fraction of 0.65 was taken into account to correct the magnetization data.

## Irreversible properties

Magnetization loops at different temperatures were recorded in order to extract J_{c} values which are known to be strongly depressed by the temperature increase in thallium-based superconductors.12 The Bean model modified for a polycrystalline sample was used with a grain size of ~3 \mum to determine the limit of current flow in the individual grains. If one considers the anisotropy of such superconductors then J_{c} is mainly dominated by the H\left\| {c}\right. component of the magnetization, and thus if \theta is the angle between the magnetic-field direction and the c-axis direction of one grain of powder, then the magnetization difference \Delta m\left( B \right) = m\left( B_{+} \right) - m\left( B_{-} \right) measured for all the grain assembly is related to the critical current density in the ab plane by the relation:

\[K\Delta m\left( B \right) = \int_{0}^{\pi/2}\!J_{c}\left( B\text{ cos}\theta \right)\text{ cos}\theta\text{ sin}\theta\text{ }d\theta\text{ ,}\]

with K = 30/d for platelet grains of mean diameter d in the Bean model. Equation (1) can also be written

\[B^{2}\Delta m\left( B \right) = K^{-1}\int_{0}^{B}\!B^{\prime}J_{c}\left( B^{\prime} \right)dB^{\prime}\]

considering B^{\prime} = B\text{ cos}\theta. Then,

\[J_{c}\left( B \right) = KB^{-1}\frac{d\left[ B^{2}\Delta m\left( B \right) \right]}{dB}\text{ .}\]

This model for polycrystalline samples was successfully tested by a comparison with single crystals on Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 and Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10. These results will be published elsewhere.

In Fig. 4(a), J_{c} values from Eq. (2) are presented in a semi-log plot with temperature ranging from 5 to 55 K. One can see that at low field and low temperature (5 K) J_{c} values reach a maximum of ~8 x 106 A cm-2; such data are typical of superconducting copper oxides. But in fact, as soon as the temperature increases, J_{c} falls off rapidly when the magnetic field increases.

In order to compare the classical Bean analysis and the

 corrected one for grains of anisotropic superconductors [Eq. (2)], the corresponding sets of J_{c}'s at 40 K are reported in Fig. 4(b). In the inset is also shown the magnetization curve m\left(H\right) at this temperature. This clearly establishes that J_{c} after correction is higher in the low-field region and also that corrected J_{c} decreases faster as H or T increases. This is also evidenced in Fig. 5 where the irreversibility lines B^{*} (defined as J_{c} = 0 for B>B^{*}) versus reduced temperature t are represented and correspond to the same J_{c} = 10^{4} A cm^{-2} criterion applied to J_{c}'s data obtained with or without correction of the Bean model. Experimental data of B^{*}(t) for Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca2Cu3O9 from Ref. 13 are also reported; this irreversibility line corresponds also to a polycrystalline sample where no corrections have been performed. So the uncorrected B^{*}(t) plot for the oxycarbonate is to be compared to the TlPb-1223 irreversibility line showing that Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr4Cu2CO3O7 pinning properties are less efficient. To our knowledge no irreversibility lines of TlPb-1223 single crystals have been reported. In order to compare the irreversibility line of the oxycarbonate after correction by our model the B^{*}(t) curves of Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 ("TI-2212") and Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10 ("TI-2223") single crystals [14] are also reported in Fig. 5; the comparison shows that the oxycarbonate B^{*}(t) line is higher in the (H,T) plane than the lines of the bilayer thallium cuprates.

It is remarkable that this oxycarbonate, which consists of single copper layers, exhibits a significantly higher irreversibility line than all the thallium bilayer cuprates whatever their structure of copper layers. Nevertheless its B^{*}(t) line remains low compared to the thallium lead monolayer cuprates Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2CaCu3O9 ("TIPb-1223") and Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca0.8Y0.2Cu3O7 ("TIPb-1212"). [9]

## 8 Reversible properties

The reversible part of the hysteresis loop, i.e., above the irreversibility line, provides a region in the (H,T) plane where the superconducting parameters can be extracted. In the intermediate-field region of H_{c1} < < H < H_{c2}, the London model predicts a linear dependence of m upon lnH although minor corrections could be added as discussed by Hao _et al._[15] Recently, Zheng, Campbell, and Liu have used the latter analysis to extract basic superconducting parameters of two thallium-based compounds TlPb-1223 and Tl-2223. [16] Their results demonstrate that in the range of magnetic field 0-5 T the linear regime of m\left(H\right) (Abrikosov formula) was never reached. So we have only considered the London model to fit our m = f\left(\ln H\right) data applying a derived equation with \kappa and H_{c} as parameters:

Figure 4: (a) J_{c} values derived from magnetization versus field measurements at the different temperatures labeled on the graph. J_{c}’s are calculated with Eq. (2). (b) J_{c}(H) at 40 K calculated with the classical Bean model and with the corrected one for a polycrystalline sample [Eq. (2)]. Inset the corresponding initial m\left(H\right) loop registered at 40 K.

  \[m=\frac{H_{c}}{8\pi\sqrt{2}\kappa}\left[-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{H}{\beta \sqrt{2}\kappa H_{c}}\right]\ .\] (3)

This expression derives from the London model expression

\[-4\pi m=\frac{\phi_{0}}{8\pi\lambda_{ab}^{2}}\ln\left[\frac{\beta H_{c2}}{H}\ \right]\] (4)

with \beta\!\sim\!1.16; considering the powder form of the sample, the latter relation must be corrected similarly to previous work on Tl-2223 and HgBa_{2}CuO_{4} (Ref. [17]) where the magnetization (m) was calculated for fully random crystallites yielding Eq. (3).

The experimental data m=f\left(\ \ln H\right) and the associated fits with Eq. (3) are represented in Fig. 6.

For each series of data \kappa and H_{c} have been adjusted over a range of magnetic fields from 1 to 5 T. The resulting \kappa and H_{c} are reported in Fig. 7. This oxycarbonate exhibits an average \kappa value of 72.5 indicating the extreme type-II character of this superconductor. As described by Zheng, Campbell, and Liu,[16]\kappa diverges close to T_{c} in the regime where fluctuations become important.

The H_{c}(0) value was extrapolated using the empirical formula

\[H_{c}(T)\!=\!H_{c}(0)\left[1\!-\left[\frac{T}{T_{c}}\right]^{2}\right]\ .\] (5)

Fitting with this formula (see Fig. 7) yields T_{c}\!=\!71.8 K and H_{c}(0)\!=\!0.56 T. The latter value is smaller than that of Tl-1223 and Tl-2223,[16] which are, respectively, 0.92 and 0.79 T.

At this point of the analysis, H_{c2}(0) can be derived since H_{c2}(T)\!=\!\kappa\sqrt{2}H_{c}(T) leading to the slope dH_{c2}/dT\!=\!-1.2 T/K. Using the Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg equation,[18] an estimation of H_{c2}(0) is obtained and consequently \xi_{ab}(0), since H_{c2}(0)\!=\!\phi_{0}/2\pi\xi_{ab}^{2}(0), where \phi_{0} is the flux quantum. Finally, one can also calculate H_{c1}(0) and \lambda_{ab}(0) from the relations H_{c1}(0)\!=\!H_{c}(0)\ln\!\kappa/\sqrt{2}\kappa and \sqrt{2}H_{c}(0)\!=\!\kappa\phi_{0}/2\pi\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) using the average value for \kappa. All these data are summarized in Table 1.

  have also been computed considering the relation:

\[\frac{\delta(4\pi m)}{\delta\ln H} = \frac{\phi_{0}}{16\pi\lambda_{ab}^{2}(T)}\]

This method has been previously used to analyze reversible magnetization data of polycrystalline thallium cuprates Tl-2212 and Tl-2223.19,20 Our data are represented in the form \lambda_{ab}^{-2} versus T in Fig. 8. The straight line is a fit using the weak-coupling clean-limit expression:

\[\lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) = 2\lambda_{ab}^{-2}(0) \times \left[ {1 - \frac{T}{T_{c}}} \right]\]

with corresponding values l_{b}(0) = 188 nm and T_{c} = 70.4 K, this T_{c} value being very close to T_{c} = 71 K measured by ac susceptibility. Both l_{b}(0) values for the oxycarbonate are very similar to those of Ref. 16 for Tl-2223 and TlPb-1223.

## DISCUSSION

The central point of the study was to report for superconducting basic parameters of an oxycarbonate. When considering the data, the first remark concerns their good agreement with values previously published for superconducting cuprates. For instance, the value of l_{b}(0) = 170 nm is concordant with values reported for thallium cuprates. For these compounds a lot of data have already been published, ranging from ~110 to ~240 nm,14,16,17,19,20 these two extreme values correspond to Tl-2223 and derive from similar magnetic measurements. Our value is close to that of Zheng, Campbell, and Liu16 for TlPb-1223 (l_{b} = 180 nm). But the T_{c} value is 115 K for TlPb-1223, roughly ~50 K higher than that of the oxycarbonate. If one considers that in the clean limit the relation \lambda^{- 2} \propto n_{s}/m^{*} is valid and taking into account the relation n_{s}/m^{*}\propto T_{c} deduced from _m_SR measurements carried out on Tl2Ba2CuO6 +- ("T1-2201") (Ref. 21) for different levels of hole doping, thus a l_{b} value close to that of TlPb-1223 may indicate that the T_{c} of the oxycarbonate is quite optimized.

Nevertheless, the mean k value (_k_ = 72.5) is much smaller than k of TlPb-1223 or Tl-2223 and corresponds to a larger f_{b}(0) value for the oxycarbonate (f_{b}(0) = 2.39 nm) to be compared for instance to f_{b}(0) = 1.17 nm for TlPb-1223. This major difference may be a consequence of the difference of _T__c_'s (T_{c} = 71 K for Tl0.5Pb0.5SrCu2CO3O7 against T_{c} = 115 K for Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca2Cu3O9), since the superconducting gap D in BCS theory is proportional to _g_-1 and proportional to T_{c}. This is in agreement with the fact that La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 exhibits a lower T_{c} value (T_{c} = 35 K) than the oxycarbonate (T_{c} = 71 K) but a larger f_{b}(0) value [_f__ab_(0) = 32 nm].22

## CONCLUSION

This set of data for the oxycarbonate Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr4Cu2CO3O7 clearly demonstrates the original character of this superconductor. This material that is characterized like the 1201 cuprates by thallium monolayers, exhibits much higher T_{c} and pinning properties that are intermediate between those of bilayer thallium cuprates and those of the best monolayer lead-doped thallium "TlPb-1223" cuprates. Consequently this thallium lead oxycarbonate behaves more like a multiple copper layer cuprate rather than a single copper-layer phase. Thus the study of superconducting oxycarbonates is of importance especially for the prospect of new high-_T__c_ materials and for the understanding of superconductivity. A comparison with other oxycarbonates is now in progress particularly with TlBa2Sr2Cu2CO3O7 (T_{c} = 62 K) whose modulated structure derives also from the 1201-type.23

The magnetic behavior of the 71-K superconductor Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr4Cu2CO3O7, which consists of an intergrowth of the two nonsuperconducting phases Sr2CuO2CO3 and Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2CuO5, has been studied. Its pinning properties in terms of the critical current density _Jc_ and the irreversibility line have been established using a modified-Bean-model expression for the magnetization data and compared to results for other thallium cuprates. Typical _Jc_ was calculated to be ~8 x 106 A/cm2 at 5 K in a field of 0.2 T. The analysis of the reversible magnetization, leading to basic values of the parameters for this oxycarbonate as l0 = 170 nm, _g_m0 = 2.39 nm and k = 72.5, was also performed. The latter values are compared to other existing data especially those concerning the thallium-based superconductors which have been derived from similar analyses. This study shows that the superconducting behavior of this oxycarbonate is closer to multiple copper layered cuprates than to the single copper layer "1201" phase although carbonate groups connect two successive copper layers. It can be considered as intermediate between the thallium bilayer cuprates and the best lead-doped "1223" and "1212" superconductors.

## INTRODUCTION

The recent discovery of a series of superconductive copper oxycarbonates (see for a review Refs. 1 and 2), with _T_c's up to 80 K states the issue of the role of carbonate groups in superconductivity for these materials. This is especially the case of the 71-K superconductor Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr4Cu2CO3O7,3 which exhibits a rather sharp transition and a significant diamagnetic volume fraction of 65% in spite of the fact that its structure [Fig. 1(a)] consists of an intergrowth of two nonsuperconducting phases, Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2CuO5 (Refs. 4 and 5) and Sr2CuO2CO3.6-7 Thus, although this phase derives from that of the 1:2:0:1 cuprates [Fig. 1(b)] by replacing one [TiO]o layer out of two by rows of the carbonate groups, it appears as a much better superconductor.

A common feature of this oxycarbonate with the thallium cuprates deals with the anisotropy of its structure, which may induce, as in the latter a high anisotropy of its superconducting properties. The investigation of superconductivity in the thallium oxycarbonate is of capital importance, since it has been shown that the physical properties of most of the thallium cuprates exhibit low capacities to carry superconducting current at T > > 4.2 K, so that their potential applications are limited. In particular, the positions of the irreversibility lines of such materials in the _H_-_T_ plane are too low. Among the different thallium cuprates, it has been demonstrated that the monolayer ones exhibit better intrinsic pinning properties than the bilayers.8,9 A model, based on weak Josephson coupling of the CuO2 layers between the rock-salt-type layers, has been proposed to explain such a difference; it predicts that the irreversibility line is steepened when the thickness of the rock-salt-type layers decreases.8 This may also explain the relatively good intrinsic pinning properties of the lead-based monolayer cuprate Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca2Cu3O9 abbreviated "TIPb-1:2:2:3", 9-11

For these reasons we have investigated the superconducting properties of the "TIPb" oxycarbonate Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr4Cu2CO3O7. Magnetic measurements have been performed on the corresponding ceramic. Pinning properties and characteristic superconducting parameters are derived here. These results are compared with exist

 ing data on the different thallium-based superconducting cuprates, especially with data determined by magnetization measurements on polycrystalline samples.

## Experimental

A polycrystalline sample Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr4Cu2CO3O7 was prepared by the solid-state reaction method described in Ref. [3]. In this technique, the reaction is carried out in a silica ampoule in order to prevent thallium losses oxides and CO2. The resulting product is an almost pure phase with some traces of TlPb-1201 and SrCO3. As-synthesized samples are found to be superconductors with 20 K <= T_{c} <= 60 K and low-temperature annealings [290 degC in argon-hydrogen flow (H2 10%)] are performed in order to optimize T_{c}.3 The susceptibility versus temperature of the optimized compound in powder form is shown in Fig. 2.

In order to obtain basic superconducting parameters of this oxycarbonate, magnetic measurements were carried out using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer with field ranging from 0 to 5 T and temperature from 5 K to T_{c}. A pause of 600 s was applied after each magnetic-field settling when hysteresis loops were recorded in order to achieve good stability; a 2-cm scan length involving a small field inhomogeneity (0.1%) was chosen for the measurements. A capsule was filled with ~100 mg of oxycarbonate in powder form and fixed on the sample holder of the SQUID system. The mean size of the grains is 3 \mum as checked with a light-diffusion granulometer and the grains present plateletlike shapes as shown on the TEM microstructure of Fig. 3. The Curie-Weiss signal related to the impurities was measured above T_{c} to subtract from the experimental data. The diamagnetic volume fraction of 0.65 was taken into account to correct the magnetization data.

## Irreversible properties

Magnetization loops at different temperatures were recorded in order to extract J_{c} values which are known to be strongly depressed by the temperature increase in thallium-based superconductors.12 The Bean model modified for a polycrystalline sample was used with a grain size of ~3 \mum to determine the limit of current flow in the individual grains. If one considers the anisotropy of such superconductors then J_{c} is mainly dominated by the H\left\| {c}\right. component of the magnetization, and thus if \theta is the angle between the magnetic-field direction and the c-axis direction of one grain of powder, then the magnetization difference \Delta m\left( B \right) = m\left( B_{+} \right) - m\left( B_{-} \right) measured for all the grain assembly is related to the critical current density in the ab plane by the relation:

\[K\Delta m\left( B \right) = \int_{0}^{\pi/2}\!J_{c}\left( B\text{ cos}\theta \right)\text{ cos}\theta\text{ sin}\theta\text{ }d\theta\text{ ,}\]

with K = 30/d for platelet grains of mean diameter d in the Bean model. Equation (1) can also be written

\[B^{2}\Delta m\left( B \right) = K^{-1}\int_{0}^{B}\!B^{\prime}J_{c}\left( B^{\prime} \right)dB^{\prime}\]

considering B^{\prime} = B\text{ cos}\theta. Then,

\[J_{c}\left( B \right) = KB^{-1}\frac{d\left[ B^{2}\Delta m\left( B \right) \right]}{dB}\text{ .}\]

This model for polycrystalline samples was successfully tested by a comparison with single crystals on Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 and Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10. These results will be published elsewhere.

In Fig. 4(a), J_{c} values from Eq. (2) are presented in a semi-log plot with temperature ranging from 5 to 55 K. One can see that at low field and low temperature (5 K) J_{c} values reach a maximum of ~8 x 106 A cm-2; such data are typical of superconducting copper oxides. But in fact, as soon as the temperature increases, J_{c} falls off rapidly when the magnetic field increases.

In order to compare the classical Bean analysis and the

 corrected one for grains of anisotropic superconductors [Eq. (2)], the corresponding sets of J_{c}'s at 40 K are reported in Fig. 4(b). In the inset is also shown the magnetization curve m\left(H\right) at this temperature. This clearly establishes that J_{c} after correction is higher in the low-field region and also that corrected J_{c} decreases faster as H or T increases. This is also evidenced in Fig. 5 where the irreversibility lines B^{*} (defined as J_{c} = 0 for B>B^{*}) versus reduced temperature t are represented and correspond to the same J_{c} = 10^{4} A cm^{-2} criterion applied to J_{c}'s data obtained with or without correction of the Bean model. Experimental data of B^{*}(t) for Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca2Cu3O9 from Ref. 13 are also reported; this irreversibility line corresponds also to a polycrystalline sample where no corrections have been performed. So the uncorrected B^{*}(t) plot for the oxycarbonate is to be compared to the TlPb-1223 irreversibility line showing that Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr4Cu2CO3O7 pinning properties are less efficient. To our knowledge no irreversibility lines of TlPb-1223 single crystals have been reported. In order to compare the irreversibility line of the oxycarbonate after correction by our model the B^{*}(t) curves of Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 ("TI-2212") and Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10 ("TI-2223") single crystals [14] are also reported in Fig. 5; the comparison shows that the oxycarbonate B^{*}(t) line is higher in the (H,T) plane than the lines of the bilayer thallium cuprates.

It is remarkable that this oxycarbonate, which consists of single copper layers, exhibits a significantly higher irreversibility line than all the thallium bilayer cuprates whatever their structure of copper layers. Nevertheless its B^{*}(t) line remains low compared to the thallium lead monolayer cuprates Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2CaCu3O9 ("TIPb-1223") and Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca0.8Y0.2Cu3O7 ("TIPb-1212"). [9]

## 8 Reversible properties

The reversible part of the hysteresis loop, i.e., above the irreversibility line, provides a region in the (H,T) plane where the superconducting parameters can be extracted. In the intermediate-field region of H_{c1} < < H < H_{c2}, the London model predicts a linear dependence of m upon lnH although minor corrections could be added as discussed by Hao _et al._[15] Recently, Zheng, Campbell, and Liu have used the latter analysis to extract basic superconducting parameters of two thallium-based compounds TlPb-1223 and Tl-2223. [16] Their results demonstrate that in the range of magnetic field 0-5 T the linear regime of m\left(H\right) (Abrikosov formula) was never reached. So we have only considered the London model to fit our m = f\left(\ln H\right) data applying a derived equation with \kappa and H_{c} as parameters:

Figure 4: (a) J_{c} values derived from magnetization versus field measurements at the different temperatures labeled on the graph. J_{c}’s are calculated with Eq. (2). (b) J_{c}(H) at 40 K calculated with the classical Bean model and with the corrected one for a polycrystalline sample [Eq. (2)]. Inset the corresponding initial m\left(H\right) loop registered at 40 K.

  \[m=\frac{H_{c}}{8\pi\sqrt{2}\kappa}\left[-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{H}{\beta \sqrt{2}\kappa H_{c}}\right]\ .\] (3)

This expression derives from the London model expression

\[-4\pi m=\frac{\phi_{0}}{8\pi\lambda_{ab}^{2}}\ln\left[\frac{\beta H_{c2}}{H}\ \right]\] (4)

with \beta\!\sim\!1.16; considering the powder form of the sample, the latter relation must be corrected similarly to previous work on Tl-2223 and HgBa_{2}CuO_{4} (Ref. [17]) where the magnetization (m) was calculated for fully random crystallites yielding Eq. (3).

The experimental data m=f\left(\ \ln H\right) and the associated fits with Eq. (3) are represented in Fig. 6.

For each series of data \kappa and H_{c} have been adjusted over a range of magnetic fields from 1 to 5 T. The resulting \kappa and H_{c} are reported in Fig. 7. This oxycarbonate exhibits an average \kappa value of 72.5 indicating the extreme type-II character of this superconductor. As described by Zheng, Campbell, and Liu,[16]\kappa diverges close to T_{c} in the regime where fluctuations become important.

The H_{c}(0) value was extrapolated using the empirical formula

\[H_{c}(T)\!=\!H_{c}(0)\left[1\!-\left[\frac{T}{T_{c}}\right]^{2}\right]\ .\] (5)

Fitting with this formula (see Fig. 7) yields T_{c}\!=\!71.8 K and H_{c}(0)\!=\!0.56 T. The latter value is smaller than that of Tl-1223 and Tl-2223,[16] which are, respectively, 0.92 and 0.79 T.

At this point of the analysis, H_{c2}(0) can be derived since H_{c2}(T)\!=\!\kappa\sqrt{2}H_{c}(T) leading to the slope dH_{c2}/dT\!=\!-1.2 T/K. Using the Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg equation,[18] an estimation of H_{c2}(0) is obtained and consequently \xi_{ab}(0), since H_{c2}(0)\!=\!\phi_{0}/2\pi\xi_{ab}^{2}(0), where \phi_{0} is the flux quantum. Finally, one can also calculate H_{c1}(0) and \lambda_{ab}(0) from the relations H_{c1}(0)\!=\!H_{c}(0)\ln\!\kappa/\sqrt{2}\kappa and \sqrt{2}H_{c}(0)\!=\!\kappa\phi_{0}/2\pi\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0) using the average value for \kappa. All these data are summarized in Table 1.

  have also been computed considering the relation:

\[\frac{\delta(4\pi m)}{\delta\ln H} = \frac{\phi_{0}}{16\pi\lambda_{ab}^{2}(T)}\]

This method has been previously used to analyze reversible magnetization data of polycrystalline thallium cuprates Tl-2212 and Tl-2223.19,20 Our data are represented in the form \lambda_{ab}^{-2} versus T in Fig. 8. The straight line is a fit using the weak-coupling clean-limit expression:

\[\lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) = 2\lambda_{ab}^{-2}(0) \times \left[ {1 - \frac{T}{T_{c}}} \right]\]

with corresponding values l_{b}(0) = 188 nm and T_{c} = 70.4 K, this T_{c} value being very close to T_{c} = 71 K measured by ac susceptibility. Both l_{b}(0) values for the oxycarbonate are very similar to those of Ref. 16 for Tl-2223 and TlPb-1223.

## DISCUSSION

The central point of the study was to report for superconducting basic parameters of an oxycarbonate. When considering the data, the first remark concerns their good agreement with values previously published for superconducting cuprates. For instance, the value of l_{b}(0) = 170 nm is concordant with values reported for thallium cuprates. For these compounds a lot of data have already been published, ranging from ~110 to ~240 nm,14,16,17,19,20 these two extreme values correspond to Tl-2223 and derive from similar magnetic measurements. Our value is close to that of Zheng, Campbell, and Liu16 for TlPb-1223 (l_{b} = 180 nm). But the T_{c} value is 115 K for TlPb-1223, roughly ~50 K higher than that of the oxycarbonate. If one considers that in the clean limit the relation \lambda^{- 2} \propto n_{s}/m^{*} is valid and taking into account the relation n_{s}/m^{*}\propto T_{c} deduced from _m_SR measurements carried out on Tl2Ba2CuO6 +- ("T1-2201") (Ref. 21) for different levels of hole doping, thus a l_{b} value close to that of TlPb-1223 may indicate that the T_{c} of the oxycarbonate is quite optimized.

Nevertheless, the mean k value (_k_ = 72.5) is much smaller than k of TlPb-1223 or Tl-2223 and corresponds to a larger f_{b}(0) value for the oxycarbonate (f_{b}(0) = 2.39 nm) to be compared for instance to f_{b}(0) = 1.17 nm for TlPb-1223. This major difference may be a consequence of the difference of _T__c_'s (T_{c} = 71 K for Tl0.5Pb0.5SrCu2CO3O7 against T_{c} = 115 K for Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr2Ca2Cu3O9), since the superconducting gap D in BCS theory is proportional to _g_-1 and proportional to T_{c}. This is in agreement with the fact that La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 exhibits a lower T_{c} value (T_{c} = 35 K) than the oxycarbonate (T_{c} = 71 K) but a larger f_{b}(0) value [_f__ab_(0) = 32 nm].22

## CONCLUSION

This set of data for the oxycarbonate Tl0.5Pb0.5Sr4Cu2CO3O7 clearly demonstrates the original character of this superconductor. This material that is characterized like the 1201 cuprates by thallium monolayers, exhibits much higher T_{c} and pinning properties that are intermediate between those of bilayer thallium cuprates and those of the best monolayer lead-doped thallium "TlPb-1223" cuprates. Consequently this thallium lead oxycarbonate behaves more like a multiple copper layer cuprate rather than a single copper-layer phase. Thus the study of superconducting oxycarbonates is of importance especially for the prospect of new high-_T__c_ materials and for the understanding of superconductivity. A comparison with other oxycarbonates is now in progress particularly with TlBa2Sr2Cu2CO3O7 (T_{c} = 62 K) whose modulated structure derives also from the 1201-type.23
