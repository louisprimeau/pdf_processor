###### Abstract

Neutron scattering, susceptibility, and resistivity measurements have been carried out on (Er1\({}_{1-x}\)Ho\({}_{x}\))Rh\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\) for concentrations \(x=1.0\), 0.89, 0.84, and 0.75, which span the "multicritical" point (\(x_{e}\approx 0.9\)) where the magnetic and superconducting phase boundaries meet. For all concentrations studied a transition to long-range ferromagnetic order is observed, with the Ho moments ordering along the tetragonal axis. The spins are in fact locked along the \(c\) axis by strong crystal-field anisotropies, yielding Ising-like magnetic behavior in this concentration region. The temperature dependence of the order parameter is mean-field-like, suggesting that the range of the magnetic interactions is large, and we attribute this behavior to the importance of dipolar interactions. In the concentration range \(x<\)\(x_{e}\) where superconductivity is observed, the magnetic transition appears to be continuous and reversible, and occurs within the nominal superconducting interval \(T_{e2}(x)<T<T_{e1}(x)\). Thus there is some kind of "coexistence" of long-range magnetic order and superconductivity in the samples, but the nature of this coexistence cannot be determined unambiguously. In particular the experimental evidence in this system is not sufficient to decide if there is true microscopic coexistence, or whether some portions of the sample are ferromagnetic and normal while other regions are superconducting and paramagnetic (or magnetically ordered with a very-long-wavelength sinusoidal periodicity). Below \(T_{M}\) strongly-temperature-dependent small-angle scattering is observed, characterized by a cross section of the Porod form \(S(Q)=A\,(T)/Q^{4}\), where \(A\,(T)\) increases monotonically with decreasing temperature. This wave-vector dependence is consistent with the assumption that the scattering originates from domain walls whose widths are large compared to the inverse-\(Q\) range explored (\(\lesssim 300\) A). In particular, no oscillatory component to the magnetization was observed for any concentration or temperature within the experimentally accessible wave-vector range of \(Q>0.003\) A\({}^{-1}\), in contrast to the behavior of ErRh\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\). At the lowest concentration studied (75 at. % Ho) the magnetization was found to be reduced in the temperature region where superconductivity appeared. The magnetic order parameter, however, was still found to be continuous and reversible.

## I Introduction

The interplay between superconductivity and magnetism has received considerable attention in recent years since the discovery of ternary rare-earth superconducting compounds which order magnetically [1]. For the case of ferromagnetic ordering there is strong competition between the magnetic and superconducting order parameters, which leads to rich and interesting behavior. In the compounds studied in detail so far, ErRh\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\)[2, 3], HoMo\({}_{6}\)S\({}_{8}\)[4, 5], and HoMo\({}_{6}\)Se\({}_{8}\)[6], superconductivity sets in at \(T_{e1}\) and then they order magnetically at much lower temperatures (\(T_{M}\ll T_{e1}\)). The competition between the superconductivity and ferromagnetism initially results in a long-wavelength (\(\sim\)\(10^{2}\) A) oscillatory component to the magnetization developing in the superconducting state. For ErRh\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\) and HoMo\({}_{6}\)S\({}_{8}\) this oscillatory magnetic phase exists only in a limited temperature interval, with the superconductivity being destroyed (at \(T_{e2}\)) and pure ferromagnetism setting in at sufficiently low temperatures [3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]. For HoMo\({}_{6}\)Se\({}_{8}\), on the other hand, this coexistence state may be indicative of the ground-state properties [6].

In the (Er-Ho)Rh\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\) alloy series of interest here, pure ErRh\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\) becomes superconducting at 8.6 K, and then reenters the normal conducting phase at 0.7 K as ferromagnetism sets in [2, 3, 7, 8]. In the intervening temperature range, below \(\sim\)\(1.2\) K, both ferromagnetism and a  sinusoidal component to the magnetization coexist with superconductivity. The amplitude of any critical fluctuations is very small in this material, and both the ferromagnetic and simuangnetic order parameters appear to be "smeared," with no clear indication of where the magnetic phase transition \(T_{M}\) is located. One possible interpretation which was advanced to explain this behavior was that the smearing originated from inhomogeneities in the polycrystalline specimens,[3, 7] but essentially identical results have been obtained on a single-crystal sample more recently,[8] and the precise nature of the magnetic-superconducting state in this material is still not completely understood. One important experimental point which has emerged is that the Er magnetic moments are constrained by crystal-field anisotropies to lie in the (tetragonal) basal plane, rendering both the magnetic and superconducting properties highly anisotropic.[11, 12]

With the substitution of holmium for erbium, all three phase boundaries (\(T_{e1}\), \(T_{e2}\), \(T_{M}\)) initially decrease slowly in temperature with increasing holmium concentration. Near \(x\sim 0.25\), \(T_{e2}\) and \(T_{M}\) reverse direction and increase with increasing \(x\), and the boundaries meet at a "multicritical" point for \(x_{e}\sim 0.9\) and a temperature of about 6 K as shown in Fig. 1.[13, 14] The crystal-field anisotropies favor the Ho moments pointing along the \(c\) axis,[11, 15, 15, 16, 17] and in fact the anisotropy is sufficiently strong to render the system Ising-like in the holmium-rich regime as we shall see below. Hence, the coupling between the Er and Ho moments in the alloy is very small, and the two types of ions order essentially independently. The behavior of the magnetic-phase boundary therefore is dominated by the holmium moments ordering first with decreasing temperature for \(x>\sim 0.25\), while the Er moments order first for \(x<\sim 0.25\).

We have been carrying out a systematic study of the magnetic and superconducting properties in the holmium-rich region in an effort to determine the nature of the competition between magnetic order and superconductivity in the regime where these two competing energies are approximately equal. Our original intention was to observe the change in the sinusoidal magnetization near \(x_{e}\) as a function of concentration, or equivalently as a function of pressure,[20] but we have not been able to obtain any evidence for an oscillatory magnetic structure in this concentration regime. Indeed, the magnetic order always appears to be ferromagnetic in nature within our experimental resolution, with a temperature interval of coexistence.[15, 16] It is not possible, however, to establish whether this coexistence is microscopic in nature, i.e., whether the same regions in the crystal are both magnetically ordered and superconducting simultaneously, or whether some regions are superconducting and paramagnetic (or a very-long-wavelength sinusoidal magnetism), while other regions are ferromagnetic and normal. At intermediate \(x\) we find a clear suppression of the magnetic order parameter when superconductivity is present, in agreement with the behavior observed[17] at lower concentrations (\(x=0.6\)), but we find no hysteresis in the magnetization.

In Sec. II we discuss the sample preparation and the experimental techniques we have used to obtain the resistivity, susceptibility, crystal-field excitations, and the wave-vector-dependent magnetization. In Sec. III we first discuss the behavior of the end compound HoRh\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\), which is not superconducting. Crystal-field anisotropies render this compound a good approximation to a three-dimensional Ising system, with mean-field behavior. In particular we present our neutron-diffraction results as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field; a detailed analysis of the crystal-field effects will be given elsewhere.[11] We will then present our results for \(x\lesssim x_{e}\), paying particular attention to the temperature interval where magnetic order develops. We will compare the present results with the behavior observed in related systems such as HoMo\({}_{6}\)S\({}_{8}\) and HoMo\({}_{6}\)Se\({}_{8}\), and discuss how our results address the question of the "coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity" in the context of various theoretical models that have been advanced. In Sec. IV we summarize our results and conclusions, and discuss possible directions for new experiments.

## II Experimental procedures

### Sample preparation and bulk magnetic measurements

All samples used in this study were prepared using the highest-purity, Ames Laboratory rare-earth metals (\(\leq\)15

Figure 1: Low-temperature phase diagram for the system (\(\mathrm{Er}_{1-x}\mathrm{Ho}_{x}\))Rh\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\) near the critical concentration (\(x\approx 0.9\)) determined by ac susceptibility measurements (\(\triangle\square\),\(\blacksquare\blacksquare\)) and neutron scattering (\(\bullet\)). Filled symbols represent data obtained from measurements on samples in the powdered form, while open symbols are data taken on ingots. For the \(x=0.89\) sample, the transition into the superconducting state is incomplete before the onset of ferromagnetism. The inset is taken from Ref. [13] to illustrate the phase diagram for all values of \(x\). Three distinct regions are labeled: normal paramagnetic (NP), superconducting paramagnetic (SP), and normal ferromagnetic (NF).

  ppm of any metallic impurity) together with commercially supplied rhodium (99.9%, Thiokol Corp., Alfa Products) and 11B isotope obtained from Eagle-Pitcher. The isotope of boron was used to avoid the very high neutron-absorption cross section of natural boron. For each sample, stoichiometric amounts of the necessary elements were melted together in a Zr-gettered argon arc furnace. The resulting ingot was turned and remelted at least six times to promote homogeneity. Mass loss was always less than 0.1%. Each sample was then sealed in a Ta tube, which was in turn sealed in a quartz ampoule and annealed for one week at 1200 degC followed immediately by one week at 800 degC. No impurity phases were detected by slow-scan powder x-ray diffraction data, indicating that any impurity-phase content was below the readily detectable limit of 5%.

Neutron diffraction did reveal the presence of some impurity phases, one of which was magnetic (\(T_{M}\) ~ 19 K), but the volume of these phases was ~ 1% or less. Susceptibility, resistivity, and neutron-scattering measurements were all carried out on identical samples to facilitate comparison of results. Low-frequency (~ 17 Hz) ac inductance measurements were performed on samples in both the ingot and powdered form to determine the critical temperatures. A standard 4He cryostat was used for experiments above 1.1 K, while a commercial (S. H. E. Corp.) 3He-4He dilution refrigerator was employed for susceptibility experiments down to 20 mK. Electrical resistivity measurements were done via a four-lead, low-frequency ac method. Platinum leads (0.002 in. diameter) were spot welded onto regularly shaped samples with a rectangular cross section. The thermometry consisted of germanium resistance thermometers for temperatures below 30 K and platinum resistance thermometers at higher temperatures.

### Neutron-scattering measurements

Even though the 11B isotope was used in preparing the samples, the materials were still quite absorbing for neutrons due to the high-absorption cross section of Rh, which has only one stable isotope. All the neutron measurements were therefore carried out on powders which were mounted between thin aluminum plates to utilize flat-plate geometry. The sample holder was then mounted in an aluminum sample chamber filled with an atmosphere (STP) of helium to facilitate thermal conduction between the sample and the cold finger upon which the sample chamber was mounted. A calibrated Ge resistor was used to measure the temperature, and in particular to determine the magnetic transition temperatures in zero field.

For the field-dependent work the samples were mounted in a flow Dewar, which could then be inserted in a split-coil superconducting magnet. The magnetic field at the sample position was perpendicular to the horizontal, with an adjustable magnitude up to 7 T. The sample temperature in this case was monitored by a GaAs diode sensor.

The diffraction and inelastic scattering measurements were taken with standard triple-axis neutron spectrometers located at the National Bureau of Standards Research Reactor. Pyrolytic graphite monochromators, analyzers, and higher-order filters were employed at a neutron energy of 14 meV. The angular collimations before and after the monochromator and analyzer were varied between 10 and 40 min depending on the intensity and resolution requirements of the measurements.

The crystal structure of the ternary rhodium borides is tetragonal with space group \(P\)42/_nmc_, which contains two formula units of _R_Rh4**B**4 per unit cell21 (_R_ = rare earth). The rare-earth positions are fixed by symmetry in the unit cell to (0, 0, \(\frac{1}{2}\)) and (\(\frac{1}{2}\), \(\frac{1}{2}\), 0), whereas the Rh and B positions have to be determined by detailed crystallographic analysis. Once the chemical structure is known, the nuclear Bragg cross sections can be calculated and then can serve to put the magnetic peaks on an absolute basis.

For our particular case of flat-plate geometry the integrated intensity from a nuclear-powder diffraction peak is given by22

\[I_{N} = C\frac{\mid F_{N}(hkl)\mid^{2}m_{hkl}e^{-\mu t\sec\theta}e^{-2W}}{\sin^{2}(2\theta)}\;,\] (1)

where (_hkl_) are Miller's indices for the reciprocal-lattice vector \(t\), \(t\) is the thickness of the sample, \(m\) is the linear absorption coefficient, 2_th_ is the scattering angle, and _m_hkl is the multiplicity of the reflection. The coefficient \(C\) is a constant that contains the details of the instrument, and \(F_{N}\) is the nuclear-structure factor for the reflection of interest:

\[\left[\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right]_{\rm nuclear} = \mid F_{N}\mid^{2}\] (2) \[= \left|\sum_{j=1}^{N^{\prime}}c_{j}b_{j}e^{i\tau\tau_{j}}\right|^{2}\;,\]

where \(b_{j}\) is the coherent nuclear-scattering length, \(c_{j}\) is the occupancy of the _j_th atom located at \(t_{j}\), and the sum extends over all atoms _N'_ in the unit cell. For the \(r_{j}\) of Rh and B we used the coordinates determined by Vandenberg and Matthias21 as modified by Moncton _et al._,3 along with the coherent scattering amplitudes _b_H0 = 0.85, _b_Er = 0.80, _b_Rh = 0.584, and \(b\)119 = 0.61 (all in units of 10-12 cm).

For magnetic Bragg scattering we have a similar type of expression for the integrated intensity:

\[I_{M} = C\left[\frac{\gamma e^{2}}{2mc^{2}}\right]^{2}\langle\mu^{2}(T,H)\rangle^{2}f^{2}(\tau)\langle\,1-(\hat{\tau}\cdot\hat{\bf M})^{2}\rangle\] (3) \[\times \frac{m_{hkl}te^{-\mu t\sec\theta}e^{-2W}\mid F_{M}(hkl)\mid^{2}}{\sin^{2}(2\theta)}\;,\]

where

\[\frac{\gamma e^{2}}{2mc^{2}} = -0.2695\times 10^{-12}\;{\rm cm}\]

is the neutron-electron dipole coupling constant, \(\langle\mu^{2}\rangle\) is the thermal average of the \(z\) component of the magnetic moment at each rare-earth site, _f_(_t_) is the value of the magnetic form factor (Fourier transform of the atomic  magnetization density), and \(\hat{\tau}\) and \(\hat{\bf M}\) are unit vectors in the direction of \(\tau\) and the magnetization, respectively. Finally, \(F_{M}\) is the magnetic-structure factor analogous to Eq. (2) but with \(b_{j}\) replaced by unity and the sum in the unit cell taken over magnetic ions only. In the present simple case \(F_{M}\) =2 or 0. The angular brackets \(\langle\ \rangle\) denote an average over equivalent reciprocal-lattice vectors and domain possibilities. In a ferromagnet we can obtain a simplified comparison by choosing reflections at the same angular setting. Then

\[\frac{I_{M}}{I_{N}} = 4\left[ \frac{\gamma e^{2}}{2mc^{2}} \right]^{2}\frac{\langle\mu^{2}\rangle^{2}f^{2}(\tau)\langle 1 - (\hat{\tau}\hat{\bf M})^{2}\rangle}{|F_{N}|^{2}}\ ,\]

from which we obtain the desired quantity

\[\langle\mu^{\rm z}(H,T)\rangle = \frac{1.855\mid F_{N}\mid}{|f(\tau)\mid}\left[ \frac{1}{\langle 1 - (\hat{\tau}\hat{\bf M})^{2}\rangle}\frac{I_{M}}{I_{N}} \right]^{1/2}\ ,\]

where \(\langle\mu^{\rm z}\rangle\) is in Bohr magnetons \(\mu_{B}\). The relative field and temperature dependence of the magnetization can be directly determined from the measurements, and these data can in turn be put on an absolute basis with the aid of the nuclear-scattering intensities.

For the measurements at small wave vectors \(Q\) we utilized the small-angle scattering facility at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS).23 This instrument employs a helical velocity selector to determine the desired neutron-wavelength incident on the sample, usually between 4 and 10 A. The angular distribution of scattered neutrons is measured with a two-dimensional position-sensitive detector placed in the vicinity of the forward-beam direction. In the present case of interest, where the sample is polycrystalline and no magnetic field is applied, the scattering must be symmetrically distributed about \({\bf Q} = 0\). We thus obtain the intensity of scattered neutrons as a function of the magnitude of the wave vector \({\bf Q}\). It should be kept in mind that in this experimental configuration we cannot obtain information about any possible anisotropic distribution of scattering in the sample, which information can be obtained only with single-crystal specimens.

## III Results

### HoRh4B4

This compound becomes ferromagnetic at 6.5 K but is not superconducting at any temperature as indicated in Fig. 1. The magnetic properties themselves are nevertheless quite interesting and we summarize the findings of a number of studies13-20,24 before presenting our field- and temperature-dependent diffraction data.

A preliminary study19 showed that the tetragonal \(c\) axis is the preferred magnetic direction in the ordered state, with an (extrapolated) low-temperature moment of 8.7_m__B_. Subsequent magnetization and specific-heat measurements17,18,17 showed that the magnetic properties could be very well described by an \(S = \frac{1}{2}\) Ising-like mean-field model. A detailed crystal-field analysis11 using magnetization, specific heat, Mossbauer and inelastic neutron-scattering measurements confirmed that the crystal-field ground state is a doublet, with the first excited state at an energy corresponding to 50 K. Thus, to a good approximation only the doublet is involved in the magnetic phase transition.

Our magnetic diffraction pattern for HoRh4B4 is shown in Fig. 2. Measurements were taken both above (7.00 K) and below (1.35 K) the magnetic ordering temperature, and the two data sets were subtracted point by point. In such a subtraction the nuclear Bragg peaks and incoherent nuclear scattering cancel (in the absence of any nuclear spin ordering), along with room background, leaving only changes in the inelastic magnetic scattering and magnetic Bragg peaks. The most evident features are the intense magnetic Bragg reflections such as the [101] and [110], whose widths are resolution limited indicating that long-range ferromagnetic order has been established. In addition we find no magnetic contribution to the [002] peak, which shows via Eq. (2) that \(\hat{\tau}\) \(\hat{\bf M} = 1\) for this reflection. Hence the Ho3+ moments must point along the \(c\) axis. These conclusions are readily evident directly from the observed data and are in good agreement with previous work.17,19 One noteworthy point of Fig. 1 is that the subtracted intensities are negative in between the Bragg peaks, revealing that there is a reduction in the scattering when the moments order. This is a necessary consequence of the sum rules on the magnetic scattering; above \(T_{M}\) all the magnetic scattering is inelastic and diffuse, while in the fully ordered state most of the magnetic intensity resides in the (purely elastic) Bragg peaks.

To put the magnetic intensities on an absolute basis we calculated the nuclear cross sections as discussed in Sec. II.2. For the [101] reflection, for example, we find \(\mid F_{N}|^{2} = 0.2695\) b. The measured integrated intensities above \(T_{M}\) and at low temperatures then yield from Eq. (5) a _c_-axis magnetic moment of

\[\mu^{\rm c}(T = 0) = (8.58 \pm 0.34)\mu_{B}\ .\]

We have used the calculated25 spherical component \(\langle j_{0} \rangle = 0.95\) for the magnetic form factor for this evaluation since the aspherical component is small for these

Figure 2: Magnetic diffraction pattern for HoRh4B4 taken with a triple-axis spectrometer set for elastic scattering and an incident neutron wavelength of 2.3509 Å. The magnetic contribution is obtained by subtracting the data measured at 7.0 K from the data at 1.35 K.

  low-angle peaks and the measurements are on a powder. Our value is in good agreement with the value of (8.7 +- 0.3)\(m_{B}\) reported by Lander _et al._19 A similar analysis for the {002} Bragg peak reveals that any ordered moment perpendicular to the \(c\) axis must be less than 0.4_m__B_.

The quoted error of 0.34_m__B_ in the determination of the absolute value of the moment is due only to statistical accuracies associated with the {101} magnetic and nuclear intensities, and in particular does not include any allowance for uncertainties in the calculations of \(\mid F_{N}\mid\). In the present case, these systematic uncertainties may be substantial since the calculated \(\mid F_{N}\mid\) are small in magnitude for the low-angle peaks due to the compensation of the terms in Eq. (2). To check the accuracy of \(\mid F_{N}\mid\) we therefore carried out a low-temperature (18 K) profile refinement for the HoRh_h_B_4 sample. We obtained _x_Rh = 0.247(1), \(\quad z_{\text{Rh}} = 0.145(1),\quad x_{\text{B}} = 0.330(1),\quad x_{\text{B}} = 0.851(1),\quad\) which are close to the values obtained for ErRh_h_B_4; the new values yielded \(\mid F_{N}\mid^{2} = 0.2584\) b with a resultant moment of 8.40_m__B_. We also tried refining the occupancies of the Ho, Rh, and B sites to determine the sensitivity of \(\mid F_{N}\mid\) to them, and obtained the same result within experimental error. We remark that this latter procedure also checks for possible discrepancies in the values of the nuclear-scattering amplitudes, which can also change \(\mid F_{N}\mid\). Based on this analysis we may estimate a possible additional error of 0.5_m__B_ in the absolute magnitude of \(m\). The crystal-field model11 predicts a ground-state moment of 10_m__B_, which appears to be outside our combined experimental errors. Bulk magnetization measurements also indicate11 a reduced moment.

The intensity of the {101} Bragg peak is shown in Fig. 3 as a function of temperature. The phase transition to the ferromagnetic state occurs at 6.47 K. Note that there is very little critical scattering associated with the phase transition, a point to which we will return when we discuss the small-angle measurements. In addition, the magnetic intensity is very close to linear in the vicinity of \(T_{M}\). For a three-dimensional ferromagnet we generally would expect the magnetization to follow a power-law behavior sufficiently close to the transition, with a critical exponent _b_:

\[M = M_{0}\left[ \frac{T_{e} - T}{T_{e}} \right]^{\beta}\,.\]

Since the intensity is proportional to the square of the magnetization as indicated in Eq. (3), we would expect the magnetic intensity near \(T_{e}\) to obey a relationship of the form

\[I = I_{0} t^{2\beta}\,,\]

where \(t = 1 - T/T_{e}\) is the reduced temperature. The observed linearity of the intensity then implies \(b\) = \(\frac{1}{2}\), the mean-field result. All the magnetic properties for this material are in fact well represented by mean-field theory,14,18 and the solid curve in the figure is just the mean-field result for \(S\) = \(\frac{1}{2}\). A detailed comparison of such a model with the experimental observations has already been carried out by Ott _et al._18 We remark that, from a pragmatic standpoint, the weak critical scattering and the linear intensity with temperature make it relatively straightforward to determine the magnetic ordering temperatures for these holmium-rich materials, and this is an important attribute when comparing the magnetic and superconducting measurements for \(x\) < 1.

Above the magnetic phase transition there is of course

Figure 3: Observed peak intensity, which is a measure of the square of the magnetization, as a function of temperature for HoRh_h_B_4. The inset shows that there is very little critical scattering associated with this phase transition. The linear dependence of \(I\) vs \(T\) in the vicinity of \(T_{e}\) (6.47 K) reveals the mean-field behavior of this transition, and the solid curve is mean-field theory for \(S\) = \(\frac{1}{2}\) (see Ref. 17).

  no spontaneously aligned magnetic moment, but a moment can be induced by applying a magnetic field. Diffraction data are shown in Fig. 4 for a temperature of 8.0 K. In zero field only the nuclear peaks are evident as shown in Fig. 4(a). Subtracting these data from the scattering with 5 T applied yields the data shown in Fig. 4(b). It is quite evident that the intensities of the magnetic peaks are much stronger than the nuclear intensities, as is the case in the ordered magnetic state. For reflections such as {102} and {201} we see that there is no magnetic intensity, as expected, since \(F_{M}\) = 0. We also remark that the intensities of the magnetic-impurity peaks (_I_) depend on \(H\). Measurements of the temperature dependence of these intensities (in zero field) show that this magnetic transition occurs at ~19 K.

Figure 5(a) shows in detail that once again there is no discernible magnetic contribution to {00 \(l\) }-type reflections so that the magnetization is indeed highly anisotropic as inferred from bulk magnetization measurements.26 Thus, the magnetic field cannot induce an appreciable magnetic moment perpendicular to the \(c\) axis for fields up to 7 T, within the experimental sensitivity of 0.4_m__B_. The field dependence of the {101} peak is shown in the bottom half of Fig. 5, where we see that 7 T is sufficient to nearly saturate the intensity of this reflection. The value of the induced moment is close to the value observed in the ordered state at low temperature. We remark that the present technique has two advantages over conventional magnetization measurements in powders. Firstly, information about the magnetic anisotropy can be obtained (in systems with symmetry lower than cubic) both in the ordered as well as the paramagnetic state on powdered specimens. In the fortunate case where the easy magnetic axis coincides with a unique crystallographic axis the magnetic structure in fact can be solved completely. Secondly, the neutrons can distinguish between the magnetic properties of the phase of interest and any possible magnetic impurities which might be present since the Bragg peaks generally will occur at different scattering angles. Thus, the measurements are usually easier to interpret. A quantitative analysis of our field-dependent data will be presented elsewhere.11

  data on a sample of \(x\!=\!0.89\), which is slightly rich in Er such that the system is superconducting over a small temperature interval. The susceptibility shows the customary \(\lambda\)-type anomaly indicative of a ferromagnetic transition (for an Ising system), except that in the vicinity of \(T_{M}\) the sample becomes superconducting. The magnetic phase transition itself is masked in the bulk susceptibility measurements by the diamagnetic response of the superconducting screening currents. The neutrons, on the other hand, directly probe the atomic (4_f_) magnetization through the magnetic contribution to the Bragg reflections and reveal the transition to long-range magnetic order. The data show that the intensity is linear in the vicinity of \(T_{M}\), indicative of the mean-field behavior of the holmium system. This linearity allows an accurate determination of \(T_{M}\!=\!5.56\) K. This transition temperature agrees very well with the \(T_{M}\) deduced from the susceptibility measurements when they are extrapolated into the superconducting region. One noteworthy point is that in this particular sample the bulk susceptibility has a _minimum_ at \(T_{M}\), due to the superconductivity, rather than a maximum. The results of Fig. 6 emphasize the complementary nature of these two experimental techniques.

Figure 7 shows the scattering at relatively small wave vectors for this material, taken with a triple-axis spectrometer. In more conventional systems a strong peak as a function of temperature will be evident in data of this type, but the weak critical scattering produces no such peak in the wave-vector-dependent susceptibility \(\chi(Q)\) for this system for this range of \(Q\). This is a further indication of the mean-field behavior of this material. We will discuss this behavior in more detail when we present our small-angle scattering data for the \(x\!=\!0.84\) compound.

The Bragg-peak intensity and small-angle data show no influence from the superconductivity, either in terms of a reduction in the expected magnetization or in terms of any hysteresis in the magnetization or susceptibility. The data in fact suggest that magnetic order may coexist with superconductivity over a limited interval of temperature, and can be interpreted with the assumption that an internal magnetization develops in the superconducting state, with the superconductivity being quenched when the internal field becomes sufficiently large. The temperature interval where the coexistence appears to occur, however, is quite small for this alloy.

At a lower holmium concentration of \(x\!=\!0.84\) the temperature interval of superconductivity is larger as shown in Fig. 8. The top part of the figure shows the measured resistivity, and the bottom portion the ac susceptibility. The superconducting transition temperatures derived from these data are \(T_{c1}\!=\!5.95\) K, and \(T_{c2}\!=\!4.95\) K. The {101} Bragg-peak intensity, on the other hand, reveals a magnetic transition temperature of 5.30 K as shown in Fig. 9. The magnetic intensity is still linear in the vicinity of \(T_{M}\), demonstrating the persistence of mean-field behavior at this lower concentration. We have observed no evidence for a reduction in the magnetization in the region where superconductivity is present, nor have we observed any thermal-cycling effects either above or below \(T_{c2}\), in contrast to the behavior clearly observed for \(x\!=\!0.6\).[17] Again our data are consistent with the assumption that an internal magnetization develops in the superconducting phase, and increases in amplitude to the point where the superconductivity is quenched.

Figure 7: Small-angle neutron-scattering data taken with a conventional triple-axis spectrometer for (Er\({}_{0.11}\)H\({}_{0.89}\))Rh\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{\rm c}\). The critical fluctuations in the system are quite weak, producing no observable peak in the wave-vector-dependent susceptibility \(\chi(Q)\).

  An interesting question in this system is whether there is an oscillatory magnetization such as has been observed in the related systems HoMo\({}_{0}\)S\({}_{8}\) and HoMo\({}_{0}\)Se\({}_{8}\) (and ErRh\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\)). One possible interpretation of the above results, for example, would be that the long-range magnetic order is oscillatory in nature, but with a wavelength \(\lambda\) which is too long to be resolved with conventional diffraction (i.e., \(\lambda\)\(\geq\) 300 A). Figure 10 shows some neutron data taken with the small-angle neutron-scattering (SANS) instrument at NBS. A neutron wavelength of 6.25 A was employed in the "high-resolution" mode.[23] The total intensity measured on the two-dimensional position-sensitive detector shows a very sharply defined phase transition at (5.32 \(\pm\) 0.02) K, while the expanded scale reveals that there are indeed weak critical fluctuations associated with the transition. The sharp character of the transition as evidenced in these data precludes the possibility of any significant inhomogeneities in these samples. We also did not observe any thermal hysteresis in the intensities.

The magnetic intensity as a function of the magnitude of the wave vector **Q** is shown in Fig. 11 for several temperatures. These data have been obtained by subtracting the scattering at high temperature (10 K) from the intensity observed at the temperature indicated, and are directly related to the wave-vector-dependent susceptibility \(X(Q)\) since the inelasticity of the (critical) scattering should be

Note that there is an indication that the scattering at the smallest wave vectors is reduced below \(T_{\rm c1}\). (b) Inverse intensity as a function of \(Q^{4}\) below \(T_{M}\). The linear behavior indicates that the scattering originates from variations in the magnetization density in real space which are very large compared to \(1/Q\).

The expanded scale shows that there is a weak critical component to the scattering as well.

The transition to long-range magnetic order occurs at 5.30 K, well inside the superconducting interval of 0.495 \(<\)\(T\)\(<\) 0.595 K. The magnetic order appears to be ferromagnetic in nature within our experimental resolution of 0.003 Å−1.

  small compared to the incident neutron energy. The top portion of the figure indicates that above the magnetic phase transition the critical scattering is quite weak and the range of the magnetic correlations is short. We remark that in the superconducting state the susceptibility \(\chi(Q)\) may be modified due to screening of the magnetic fluctuations by the supercurrents.[27] Such screening should become important for length scales of the order of or larger than the London penetration depth \(\lambda_{L}\) (typically \(\sim\!10^{3}\) A) so that the effects of superconductivity on the paramagnetic fluctuations should be evident for \(Q\!\lesssim\!1/\lambda_{L}\). For the present system \(\lambda_{L}\) is not known, but we note that the intensity at the smallest wave vectors does in fact decrease below \(T_{e1}\) rather than increase in intensity as expected when approaching the transition. This is an important observation because it would be a direct confirmation of the theoretical foundations on which most theories of these systems are based. The statistical uncertainties in the present case are quite large, however, due to the strong metallurgical scattering from these powdered specimens. It is also at the small-\(Q\) limit of the spectrometer. Consequently these results can be taken only as suggestive at present, not definitive.

The data below \(T_{M}\) are shown in the lower half of Fig. 11. We see that the scattering is in good agreement with the assumption that the intensity obeys a relation of the Porod form[28]

\[S(Q) = \frac{A(T)}{Q^{4}}\ ,\]

where \(A(T)\) is a temperature-dependent amplitude. This general dependence on \(Q\) is customary for scattering from objects whose spatial extent is much larger than the inverse wave-vector range of interest.[28, 29] Thus, the most likely interpretation of our data below \(T_{M}\) is that the scattering originates from domains (or domain walls) whose average size is much larger than \(1/Q\!\sim\!250\) A. Another possibility, however, is that the system has developed an oscillatory magnetic state, but with a wavelength which is out of the range of our observations. We remark that there is no evidence for an oscillatory component within the accessible range of \(Q\), and there is no evidence for any thermal-hysteresis effects such as have been observed in some related systems.[5, 7, 8, 9, 10]

The lowest concentration sample we have studied is \(x\!=\!0.75\), where we observed a \(T_{e1}\) of 6.3 K and a reentrant transition of 4.1 K. The \(\left\{101\right\}\) Bragg-peak intensity is shown in Fig. 12. Below \(T_{e2}\) there is a temperature interval where the intensity is linear as observed at larger \(x\), and extrapolating these data to higher temperatures (dashed line) yields an expected magnetic transition temperature of \(\sim\!4.75\) K. In the superconducting region, however, there is a clear reduction in the intensity as well as an apparent rounding similar to the "smearing" observed in ErRhB\({}_{4}\). This "smearing" makes it more difficult to pinpoint the actual transition temperature, but it is certainly between 4.6 and 4.7 K. Thus, the observed \(T_{M}\) is well above \(T_{e2}\) in this case. We also remark that we have observed no thermal-cycling effects; the data are completely reproducible on warming and cooling. A similar reduction in the magnetization has been observed[17] at \(x\!=\!0.6\), but the magnetic transition appeared sharper in that case, with \(T_{M}\) coinciding with a spike in the heat capacity suggesting that \(T_{M}\!=\!T_{e2}\). In addition, thermal-cycling effects were observed in that case, but only below \(T_{e2}\).

## IV Discussion

### Mean-field behavior of HoRh\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\)

Our field-dependent measurements demonstrate that the holmium moments are locked along the (unique) tetragonal axis so that the magnetic properties at low temperatures should be well described by an Ising Hamiltonian in three spatial dimensions (\(d\!=\!3\)). For the usual case of short-range exchange interactions, the upper marginal dimensionality \(d^{\star}\), above which the mean-field description of the critical phenomena is valid, is four. Consequently we might expect conventional critical behavior with nonclassical exponents.[30] In the low-temperature ferromagnets of present interest, however, dipolar interactions undoubtedly will be important, and the presence of such long-range interactions can qualitatively change the nature of the transition.[31, 32] In particular for an Ising ferromagnetic with dipole interactions only the upper-marginal dimensionality is reduced to \(d^{\star}\!=\!3\), in which case we expect only logarithmic corrections to the mean-field results. We remark at the outset of this discussion that it will be difficult to make any detailed comparisons of our data with theory since we obtain only crystallographically averaged data on these powders. Rather, we adopt the more modest goal of discussing the possible origin of the mean-field-like behavior which has been observed in this system. To this end we will briefly review the theoretical expectations for Ising dipolar ferromag

Figure 12: Temperature dependence of the \(\left\{101\right\}\) Bragg peak for \(x\!=\!0.75\), showing a clear anomaly in the magnetization in the region where superconductivity exists. However, no hysteresis in the magnetization or susceptibility is observed.

  nets,30-32 and then compare the observed behavior with the experimental data on related systems such as LiTbF4 where detailed observations of the critical phenomena have been made on single-crystal specimens.33-37

At the marginal dimensionality \(d = d^{\bullet}\) calculations of critical phenomena can be carried out very accurately since they do not have to rely on techniques such as \(\epsilon\) or \(1/n\) expansions. For a dipolar-coupled Ising ferromagnet the critical behavior should be given by the mean-field predictions multiplied by logarithmic factors.31,32 For example, the magnetization is expected to follow

\[M = Bt^{1/2}\mid \ln t\mid^{1/3}\]

(with \(B\) a critical amplitude) rather than the more customary power-law behavior given by Eq. (6) (with \(\beta = \frac{1}{2}\)). In the more general case where both dipolar and exchange contributions must be considered, we expect a crossover from three-dimensional Ising to dipolar behavior as the critical temperature is approached. This crossover occurs when32

\[t^{\phi} \simeq \delta = \frac{(g\mu_{B})^{2}}{Ja^{d}}\ ,\]

where \(g\mu_{B}\) is the magnetic moment per spin, \(a\) is the (cubic) lattice parameter, \(J\) is the (isotropic) exchange constant, and \(\phi\) is the crossover exponent. This crossover in characteristic behavior will occur for all ferromagnets sufficiently close to the transition, but the dipolar effects play a much more important role in materials where the exchange coupling is weak.

These theoretical ideas have been tested in detail for a number of materials. In LiTbF4, for example, the (antiferromagnetic) exchange interactions are only 25% of the dipolar contributions34 (\(\mu_{x} = 8.9\mu_{B}\)), leading to a ferromagnetic phase transition with \(T_{c} = 2.87\) K. Of particular relevance to the present discussion are the following points. The first is that the neutron-scattering measurements33,34 determined a critical exponent \(\beta = 0.45\), close to the mean-field value. Indeed the presence of the logarithmic correction terms could only be determined with very precise measurements.35-37 Secondly, the critical fluctuations were found to be very weak in amplitude (and highly anisotropic).33

To estimate the ratio of dipolar-to-exchange energies for HoRh4B4, we first calculate the dipole energy. For two spins a distance \(r\) apart, the energy of interaction is

\[E = 0.6229\mu_{z}^{2}\frac{(1 - 3z^{2}/r^{2})}{r^{3}}\ ,\]

where \(z\) is the distance along the Ising axis. The numerical constant has been chosen such that if \(\mu_{x}\) is in Bohr magnetons, \(z\) and \(r\) in angstroms, then \(E\) is in degrees Kelvin. For nearest-neighbor moments in HoRh4B4 we have \(E = - 0.002\,05\mu_{z}^{2} = - 0.205\) K, assuming that each moment is 10\(\mu_{B}\). (For LiTbF4 we have \(E = - 0.533\) K.) To calculate the total magnetic contribution for any particular spin we sum Eq. (11) over all other spins in the system, which yields \(E = - 0.859\) K. The dipole energy needed to reverse a spin is then twice this value. Clearly the dipolar effects will be quite important in this material although the dipole energy alone is certainly not sufficient to explain the observed transition temperature of 6.5 K. We thus assume that the additional ferromagnetic energy needed is of exchange origin. From mean-field theory we obtain the estimate \(J = 3T_{M}^{(\text{ex})}/[ \delta S(S + 1) = 1.59\) K, where \(S = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(\delta = 12\) is the (approximate) number of nearest neighbors. Finally, from Eq. (10) we can then estimate the dipolar crossover \(\widehat{g}\) as 2.4. We therefore conclude that the observed mean-field behavior, at least in the critical region, originates from the dipolar interactions in HoRh4B4. The same estimate for LiTbF4 gives \(\widehat{g} \sim 16\) so that dipolar effects completely dominate in this "ideal" dipolar material. For an exchange-dominated system like iron, on the other hand, we have \(\widehat{g} \sim 0.002\).

Note that we need to assume a ferromagnetic exchange interaction for HoRh4B4 in order to explain the observed transition temperature, whereas in LiTbF4 the (measured) exchange is negative. The importance of the exchange interaction in determining \(T_{M}\) is exemplified by the results for Ho(Rh1 = \(x\) \(Ir_{x}\) \(\downarrow\)B4, where \(T_{M}\) is found to decrease rapidly with increasing \(x\) and the magnetic structure becomes antiferromagnetic38 for sufficiently large \(x\). The dipolar interactions for this alloy of course should be independent of \(x\) if we assume that the crystal-field ground state is not disturbed by the randomness introduced on the Rh sublattice.

One final comment concerns the observed mean-field behavior for the magnetization of HoRh4B4 over the full temperature range as shown in Fig. 3 (and Ref. 17). In LiTbF4 the comparison is less satisfactory, which opens the question of the range and nature of the nondipolar interactions in these magnetic superconductors. In the composition region below \(x_{e}\) the magnetic-superconducting coupling may be quite long in range as the system tries to order, since both the exchange as well as the electromagnetic interactions are coupled, and the length scales for the superconducting state (the London penetration depth and the coherence length \(\xi\)) are large. Indeed, for the superconducting transition itself the natural length scales involved lead to mean-field behavior for properties such as the specific heat. Of course for \(x > x_{e}\) the superconducting state is suppressed, but the propensity to be a superconductor is still present and it may be necessary to incorporate these energetics (and electronic length scales) to obtain a full understanding of these systems. Precise measurements on single-crystal specimens will be needed to unravel the details of these various interactions.

### \(x < x_{e}\)

A summary of the transition temperatures and ordered magnetic moments for our samples is given in Table 1. When the magnetic order develops, we see that there is a region of temperature where superconductivity is maintained for \(x < x_{e}\), with the interval of coexistence increasing with decreasing \(x\). In comparing the transition temperatures measured with neutrons and bulk measurements, it is clearly essential to take the data on identical samples. It is also essential to establish the accuracy of the temperature scales for the two measurements in order  to effect a reliable comparison. For the pure holmium compound we found that the magnetic transition determined from susceptibility agreed with the neutron measurements within the combined experimental errors of ~0.03 K. In addition, the helium bath provides an international standard for thermometry in this temperature range. Consequently, we believe our temperature measurements should be accurate on an absolute scale to about +-0.02 K over the entire temperature range of interest. The measured differences between the reentrant superconducting transitions and the magnetic transition temperatures, on the other hand, are as large as 0.68 K. Thus, it is impossible to attribute these large differences in transition temperatures to discrepancies in thermometry.

Theoretically, coexistence of pure ferromagnetism and superconducting is not expected to be possible so that we expect any ordered magnetic state to be nonuniform on some length scale.[27] In the three related compounds ErRh4B4, HoMo6S8, and HoMo6Se8, a sinusoidal magnetic state in fact is found to coexist with superconductivity with a characteristic wavelength \(l_{M}\) of the magnetic order parameter of ~102 A. In the present alloy one possible explanation for our experimental results is that \(l_{M}\) is considerably larger than 102 A, and hence is outside our experimental range. We can make an estimate of \(q_{c}\) for the present system by assuming that the magnetic stiffness parameter \(g\)  \(T_{M}\) and the (zero-temperature) London penetration depth \(l_{L}\)(0)  1/_T__c_1. Then the theoretical relation [39, 40] suggests that

\[q_{e} \propto (\gamma\lambda_{L})^{- 1/2} \propto \left[ \frac{T_{e1}}{T_{M}} \right]^{1/2}.\]

For the sake of this estimate we choose to use the measured parameters for HoMo6S8 since this material has a (similar) saturated magnetic moment of \(m_{z}\)(0) = 9 \(m_{B}\), and it has the unique crystallographic axis as the preferred magnetic direction; we have _T__e_1 = 1.8 K, \(T_{M}\) = 0.7 K, and \(q_{c}\) = 0.03 A-1. Scaling these values via Eq. (12) then yields for \(x\)  \(q_{c}\) ~0.005 A-1 at low temperatures, which is just in the range of accessible wave vectors. However, near _T__e_1 \(l_{L}\) should be strongly temperature dependent, with 1/_l__L_ ~0 as _T__T__c_2. Thus, we would expect the actual \(q_{c}\) to be considerably smaller than this estimate, and hence out of the range of our experimental limit of ~0.003 A-1. An alternate possibility is that a vortex lattice has formed spontaneously in the superconductivity region, with a periodicity which is again beyond the present limits of measurements. Clearly data at small-er \(q\) could be illuminating. We remark that these oscillatory magnetic states are considerably shorter in wavelength, and physically are fundamentally different, than the typical formation of periodic domain walls.[41]

Finally we compare our results with those at lower holmium concentrations, where a distinct peak in the specific heat has been observed at \(T_{M}\). As we approach \(x_{c}\) the anomaly in \(T_{M}\) and the spike in \(C_{p}\) become smaller, and they may rapidly reduce in size when \(T_{M}\)(_x_) ~ _T__c_1(_x_) and \(x\) ~ \(x\) ~ \(x\). This region in (_x_, _T_) is characterized by a strong variation in \(l_{L}\), which may alter the balance of energies near \(x_{c}\) and produce different physical behavior, particularly with regard to possible modulated magnetic states. For example, as \(x\) ~ \(x\) ~ _x_c conventional ferromagnetic domains (where the domain walls are possibly superconducting [42]) and the isunmagnetic-superconducting states may not be distinct. Present samples and experimental techniques are not adequate to address these questions at the moment, but they should prove to be interesting areas of endeavor in the future.
