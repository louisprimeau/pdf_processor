###### Abstract

We report comprehensive ⁷⁷Se NMR measurements on a single crystalline
sample of the recently discovered FeSe-based high-temperature
superconductor K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ (T_(c) = 33 K) in a broad temperature
range up to 290 K. Despite deviations from the stoichiometric KFe₂Se₂
composition, we observed ⁷⁷Se NMR line shapes as narrow as 4.5 kHz under
a magnetic field applied along the crystal c axis, and found no evidence
for co-existence of magnetic order with superconductivity. On the other
hand, the ⁷⁷Se NMR line shape splits into two peaks with equal
intensities at all temperatures when we apply the magnetic field along
the ab plane. This suggests that K vacancies may have a superstructure
and that the local symmetry of the Se sites is lower than the tetragonal
fourfold symmetry of the average structure. This effect might be a
prerequisite for stabilizing the s_(±) symmetry of superconductivity in
the absence of the hole bands at the Brillouin zone center. From the
increase of NMR linewidth below T_(c) induced by the Abrikosov lattice
of superconducting vortices, we estimate the in-plane penetration depth
λ_(±ab) ∼ 290 nm and the carrier concentration n_(c) ∼ 1 × 10⁺²¹ cm⁻³.
Our Knight shift ⁷⁷K data indicate that the uniform spin susceptibility
decreases progressively with temperature, in analogy with the case of
FeSe (T_(c) ∼ 9 K) as well as other FeAs high-T_(c) systems. The strong
suppression of ⁷⁷K observed immediately below T_(c) for all crystal
orientations is consistent with a singlet pairing of Cooper pairs. We do
not however observe the Hebel-Slichter coherence peak of the nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T₁ immediately below T_(c), expected for
conventional BCS s-wave superconductors. In contrast with the case of
FeSe, we do not observe evidence for an enhancement of low-frequency
antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations near T_(c) in 1/T₁T. Instead, 1/T₁T
exhibits qualitatively the same behavior as overdoped
non-superconducting Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))_(x)As₂ with x ∼ 0.14 or
greater, where hole bands are missing in the Brillouin zone center. We
will discuss the implications of our results on the unknown mechanism of
high-temperature superconductivity in FeSe and FeAs systems.

## I Introduction

The mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity in iron-arsenides[1]
remains highly controversial despite a large volume of experimental and
theoretical works reported over the past three years.[2, 3, 4, 5] More
thorough and systematic investigations of various iron-based systems are
necessary to identify the superconducting mechanism. Very recently, Guo
_et al._ reported discovery of K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂, a variant of
iron-based high-T_(c) superconductor made of a combination of Fe and Se
rather than Fe and As.[6] By intercalation K into FeSe (T_(c) ∼ 9
K^(7/8)), T_(c) exceeds 30 K.[6] The crystal structure[6] is analogous
to that of BaFe₂As₂-based high-T_(c) systems.[9, 10] Subsequent studies
not only confirmed the initial discovery but also demonstrated that the
Rb or Cs intercalation in lieu of K also results in high-T_(c)
superconductivity.[11, 12, 13, 14, 15] Intensive bulk and spectroscopic
studies are currently underway around the world.[16, 17, 18]

Very recently angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)
measurements on K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ revealed that unlike iron-arsenide
high-T_(c) systems, all the hole bands near the center of the first
Brillouin zone are filled by electrons donated by intercalated K.[16] In
many other iron-arsenide systems the presence of the Fermi surface
nesting between the hole bands at the zone center and additional
electron bands near the zone edge, and antiferromagnetic spin
fluctuations (AFSF) which may be associated with the nesting effects,
have been considered an important ingredient of the high-T_(c)
mechanisms. As such, the K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ system may provide a
counterexample to the significance of the presence of the hole bands.

These remarkable findings have opened an avenue to shed light on the
mechanism of high-T_(c) superconductivity in iron-based systems through
comparison between FeSe- and FeAs-based superconductors. What is the key
effect of the K doping that results in the elevated T_(c)? Do the
vacancies of the K sites affect the electronic properties? Are AFSF
enhanced by electron doping? What is the nature of the superconducting
state below T_(c)?

In what follows we will report comprehensive microscopic investigations
into the structural, electronic, and superconducting properties of a
single crystal sample of K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ based on ⁷⁷Se NMR
spectroscopy. ⁷⁷Se is an NMR active nucleus with nuclear spin I =
$\frac{1}{2}$ and nuclear gyromagnetic ratio γ_(n)/2π = 8.118 MHz/T, and
is readily observable from a relatively small crystal (∼30 mg). Our NMR
data will provide us with rich information and insight into the
fascinating model system.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we will
briefly describe the experimental procedures. Section III contains
experimental results and discussions and comparison with earlier NMR
works on various iron-based superconductors. We summarize and conclude
in Sec. IV.

## II Experiment

Single crystalline samples of nominal composition K_(0.8)Fe₂Se₂ were
grown using the self-flux method. Powder x-ray diffraction on ground
samples were taken with Cu K_(α) radiation (λ=1.5418 A) using a Rigaku
Miniflex x-ray machine. The lattice parameters were obtained using the
Riectica software.[19] The elemental analysis was performed using
energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) in a JEOL JSM-6500 scanning
electron microscope. The result showed stoichiometry consistent with
both K and Fe defficiency: K0.65(3)Fe1.41(4)Se2.00(4). We will describe
the details of the crystal growth, structural refinement, and the
characterization of the bulk superconducting properties elsewhere.[14;
15] We selected one piece of crystal weighing approximately 30 mg for
our NMR measurements. K_(x)Fe2_(x − γ)Se2 (as well as FeSe) is highly
sensitive to oxidizing conditions, and to avoid decomposition of the
crystal, we stored and transported it in a quartz tube sealed in vacuum.
We also limited the exposure of the NMR crystal to air to several
minutes during the preparation for NMR measurements.

To confirm the high quality of the particular piece of crystal selected
for NMR, we checked the superconducting transition with high frequency
ac magnetic susceptibility measurements in situ by observing the
temperature dependence of the tuning frequency of our NMR circuit near
67.7 MHz. Our NMR sample has a T_(c) of 33 K in zero applied field.

All ⁷⁷Se NMR measurements were conducted by applying an external
magnetic field of 8.3 T along the crystal c axis or within the ab plane.
Very narrow NMR line shapes with the FWHM (full width at half maximum)
as narrow as 4.5 kHz allowed us to measure the line shapes by taking the
last Fourier transformation (FFT) of the envelope of Hahn’s spin echo.
In order to measure the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T₁, we applied an
inversion π pulse prior to the spin-echo sequence. We found that the
recovery after the π pulse fits nicely with the standard single
exponential form, as expected for the case of nuclear spin 1/2 in a
homogeneous sample.

## III Results and discussions

### In situ ac-susceptibility measurements

We summarize the results of in situ ac magnetic susceptibility
measurements in Fig. 1. We tuned the NMR tank circuit slightly above
T_(c) at a frequency of $f_{\rm tune}(T_{c})\sim 67.7$ MHz, and
monitored the shift of the tuning frequency $\Delta f_{\rm tune}(T)$ as
a function of temperature using a network analyzer. The tuning frequency
varies as

$$f_{\rm tune}(T)\sim\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}},$$
(1)

where L and C represent the inductance and the capacitance of the NMR
tank circuit, respectively. When the K_(x)Fe_(2 − γ)Se₂ crystal
undergoes a superconducting phase transition, the bulk magnetic
susceptibility $\chi_{\rm bulk}$ becomes negative because of the
Meissner effects. Accordingly, the total inductance
$L=L_{o}(1+\chi_{\rm bulk})$ also decreases below T_(c), where L_(o) is
the bare inductance without the sample. Hence $f_{\rm tune}(T)$
increases below T_(c) [i.e., $-\Delta f_{\rm tune}(T)<0$]. We note that
this is a very effective technique to determine T_(c) of the NMR sample,
as demonstrated earlier for our NMR study of FeSe under pressure.[20]

We normalize $-\Delta f_{\rm tune}(T)$ by dividing it with
$f_{\rm tune}(T_{c})$, and plot
$-\Delta f_{\rm tune}(T)/f_{\rm tune}(T_{c})$ as a function of
temperature in Fig. 1. The zero-field results exhibit a reasonably sharp
superconducting phase transition with an onset as high as at T_(c) = 33
K. In the presence of an applied magnetic field of B_(ab) = 8.3 T along
the ab plane, T_(c) decreases somewhat to ∼32 K. In contrast, when we
applied B_(c) = 8.3 T oriented along the c axis we observed a small but
noticeable change of $f_{\rm tune}(T)$ beginning as high as T_(c) ∼ 31
K, followed by much more dramatic change at a substantially lower
temperature ∼28 K. Our finding of the broad transition with a magnetic
field along the c axis may be related to a recent report that the
resistive superconducting transition becomes very broad under B_(c) due
to strong two dimensionality of the K_(x)Fe_(2 − γ)Se₂ system.[12]

Because of the aforementioned sensitivity of the crystal to oxidization
in air, we were forced to complete setting up our cryogenic NMR probe,
NMR coil, the sample holder, and their loading into our crystal in less
than 10 min after we broke the vacuum seal. As such, we were unable to
optimize the shape of the NMR coil and minimize its volume. We estimate
that the sample volume is as little as 10

Figure 1: (Color online) The change of the tuning frequency
$-\Delta f_{\rm tune}(T)$ of the NMR tank circuit induced by
superconducting Meissner effects. The data points shown,
$-\Delta f_{\rm tune}(T)/f_{\rm tune}(T_{c})$, are normalized with the
normal state value of $f_{\rm tune}(T_{c})\sim 67.7$ MHz. The overall
magnitude of the results in (a) and (b) should not be directly compared
because we used different coil configurations for the measurements with
B_(ab) = 8.3 T.

### ⁷⁷Se NMR line shapes

In Fig. 2 we present representative ⁷⁷Se NMR line shapes observed at
various temperatures under a magnetic field of B_(c) = 8.3 T applied
along the crystal c axis. Except below T_(c) the integrated intensity of
the NMR line shape does not show any noticeable temperature dependence.
It is worth emphasizing that the NMR linewidth is as narrow as ∼4.5 kHz
in the normal state above T_(c). These line shapes are by a factor of ∼8
narrower than the ⁷⁵As NMR central line in the optimally Co-doped
superconducting system Ba(Fe_(1.92)Co_(0.08))₂As₂.[21] The narrowness of
the ⁷⁷Se line shapes is in part due to the fact that ⁷⁷Se nuclear spin
is 1/2 and therefore there are no nuclear quadrupole effects. However,
such narrow ⁷⁷Se NMR line shapes also assure us that there is no
macroscopic inhomogeneity in our crystal induced by, among other
possibilities, a distribution in the concentration of K defects. Given
the sizable magnitude of the NMR Knight shift ⁷⁷K to be presented in
Fig. 4, a macroscopic inhomogeneity in the K concentration would
significantly broaden the ⁷⁷Se line shape though a distribution in ⁷⁷K.

For comparison, we also show an NMR line shape observed at 50 K with
B_(ab) = 8.3 T applied along an arbitrary direction within the ab plane.
The overall temperature dependence of the ab-plane line shape was found
to be very similar to the case of the c-axis line shapes. Unlike the
case of c-axis line shapes, however, the ab-plane line shapes always
split into two separate lines with identical integrated intensities. We
ruled out the possibility of a mixed-phase sample based on powder x-ray
diffraction measurements. In addition, given that the two separate lines
have the same integrated intensity, it is highly unlikely that the NMR
line splitting is caused by the presence of two domains with different K
or Fe compositions. Furthermore, if our crystal was a mixed phase, then
the c-axis NMR line shapes would split into two as well. We also
confirmed that the separation of the two peaks (∼12 kHz in B_(ab) = 8.3
T) changes in proportion to the magnitude of B_(ab). This means that the
splitting is caused by paramagnetic effects of two structurally
inequivalent Se sites rather than static hyperfine magnetic fields.
Therefore we rule out the possibility that the observed line splitting
is caused by a magnetic long-range order.

These considerations lead us to suggest the possibility that locally
there are two distinct environments for Se sites under the presence of
the in-plane magnetic field. For example, suppose K defects from a
superstructure and the fourfold symmetry at the Se sites is _locally_
lowered to twofold symmetry without breaking the overall tetragonal
symmetry of the average structure. Then the ⁷⁷Se NMR line may split into
two under the presence of an in-plane magnetic field while the c-axis
line shapes would remain single peaked. We remind the reader of a
precedent that ²³Na, ⁵⁹Co, and ¹⁷O NMR lines exhibits complicated line
splittings in Na_(x)CoO₂ because of the vacancy ordering at the Na
sites.[22, 23, 24] In fact, after the initial submission of this work,
single-crystal x-ray measurements showed the formation of a
superstructure of K and Fe defects.[25]

Estimation of the superconducting penetration depth λ_(ab) and the
carrier density n_(s) from the NMR linewidth

The temperature dependence of the FWHM of the NMR line shapes
$\Delta f_{\rm NMR}$ is summarized in Fig. 3 for the single peak
observed for the c-axis measurements. $\Delta f_{\rm NMR}$ shows a mild
increase with temperature from as narrow as $\Delta f_{\rm NMR}=4.5$ kHz
near T_(c) to 8 kHz at 290 K, the highest temperature we reached. This
increase with temperature is attributed to the increase of the NMR
Knight shift ⁷⁷K in the same temperature range (as shown in Fig. 4).

Upon entering the superconducting state, $\Delta f_{\rm NMR}$ suddenly
begins to show a dramatic increase and reaches
$\Delta f_{\rm NMR}\sim 30$ kHz at the base temperature of our
measurements, 8 K. This is a generic feature which is expected for
type-II superconductors. When the applied magnetic field penetrates our
crystal along the c axis an Abrikosov lattice of superconducting
vortices form. The magnitude of the local magnetic field varies position
by position because the magnetic field near the superconducting flux
ϕ_(o) = hc/2e = 2.07 × 10⁻⁷ Oe cm² decays with a length scale set by the
in-plane _London penetration depth λ_(ab)_. If the position-dependent
distribution of the local magnetic field B_(c) yields a second moment
ΔB_(c), the NMR linewidth will also have an enhanced second moment,
$\Delta f_{\rm NMR}^{\rm Vortex}=\gamma_{n}\Delta B_{c}$. Theoretically,
one can relate ΔB_(c) with λ as[26, 27]

$$\Delta B_{c}\sim 0.0609\frac{\phi_{o}}{\lambda^{2}}.$$
(2)

One can thus deduce λ_(ab) from the NMR line broadening below T_(c). We
note that μSR measurements of the penetration depth rely on this
technique originally developed for NMR. From the observed increase of
the NMR linewidth, we estimate λ_(ab) ∼ 290 nm at 8 K. The observed
value is comparable

observed at various temperatures in an external magnetic field
B_(c) = 8.3 T applied along the crystal c axis. We normalized the
magnitude of each FFT trace so that the integrated intensity is equal
between different temperatures. A noisy line shape at 8 K reflects the
extremely weak signal intensity due to the superconducting shielding
effects. The systematic decrease of the peak frequency reflects the
reduction of the local spin susceptibility. Inset: A representative FFT

to the case of LaFeAsO_(0.91)F_(0.09).[28] We must note, however, that
our results were obtained in a magnetic field as large as 8.3 T and
application of such a high-magnetic field tends to underestimate
$\Delta f_{\rm NMR}$, hence our λ_(ab) may be somewhat overestimated.

From the London relation we can also estimate the density of
superconducting electrons n_(s) from λ_(ab) as

$$n_{s}=\frac{m^{*}c^{2}}{4\pi e^{2}\lambda_{ab}^{2}}.$$
(3)

By taking the enhancement of the effective mass m^(*) as 2-4,[29, 30] we
obtain n_(s)∼ (0.7-1.2) × 10⁺²¹ cm⁻³.

### Uniform spin susceptibility as measured by NMR Knight shift ⁷⁷K

In Fig. 4 we summarize the temperature dependence of the ⁷⁷Se NMR Knight
shift ⁷⁷K,

$${}^{77}K=A_{\rm hf}\chi_{\rm spin}+K_{\rm chem},$$
(4)

where $A_{\rm hf}$ is the hyperfine coupling constant between the
observed ⁷⁷Se nuclear spins and electron spins in their vicinity,
$\chi_{\rm spin}$ is the spin susceptibility of those electrons, and
$K_{\rm chem}$ is the temperature independent chemical shift originating
from the orbital motion of electrons. From the asymptotic value of ⁷⁷K
observed well below T_(c), we estimate $K_{\rm chem}\sim 0.11\%$. Since
Fe-based superconductors are multiorbital systems, in principle,
different orbitals may have separate contributions to both $A_{\rm hf}$
and $\chi_{\rm spin}$. In what follows we ignore such potential
complications for the sake of simplicity. We need to bear in mind,
however, that ⁷⁷K may be a weighted average of the spin susceptibility
of different orbitals.

Figure 4 presents both ⁷⁷K measured with a magnetic field applied along
the c axis (⁷⁷K_(c)) and ab plane (⁷⁷K_(ab)). ⁷⁷K_(c) and ⁷⁷K_(ab) show
qualitatively the same temperature dependence in the entire temperature
range. Plotted in Fig. 5 is ⁷⁷K_(ab) vs ⁷⁷K_(c) by choosing temperature
as the implicit parameter and the fit with a straight line is good. This
linearity implies that the spin

open symbols represent the results with magnetic field 8.3 T applied
along the crystal c axis (⁷⁷K_(c)) and ab plane (⁷⁷K_(ab)),
respectively. Notice a sharp drop below T_(c) for both orientations and
the change of the curvature in the normal state near 200 K. The solid
curve represents a fit with an activation form
${}^{77}K_{\rm spin}\sim\exp(-\Delta_{sc}/k_{B}T)$ with the
superconducting energy gap Δ_(sc)/k_(B) = 92 K. The dashed curve
represents a phenomenological fit with a pseudogap
${}^{77}K_{\rm spin}\sim\exp(-\Delta/k_{B}T)$ with Δ/k_(B) = 435 K. For
comparison we also present the normal state results above T_(c) = 9 K of
FeSe.[20]

Figure 5: ⁷⁷K_(ab) plotted as a function of ⁷⁷K_(c) by choosing
temperature as the implicit parameter. We find a good linear fit with a
slope of 1.22 ± 0.01, implying an identical temperature dependence of
$\chi_{\rm spin}^{ab}$ and $\chi_{\rm spin}^{c}$ but with a possibility
of a sizable anisotropy in their magnitudes. The vertical dashed line
represents a provisional estimation of the chemical shift
${}^{77}K_{\rm chem,c}=0.11\pm 0.02\%$ along the c axis.

the ⁷⁷Se NMR FFT line shapes observed in B_(c) = 8.3 T. The dramatic
enhancement below T_(c) is caused by the Abrikosov lattice of
superconducting vortices and the enhanced width is proportional to
1/λ_(ab)².

susceptibility along the c axis $\chi_{\rm spin}^{c}$ indeed shows
identical behavior to $\chi_{\rm spin}^{ab}$ along the ab plane. Within
experimental uncertainties, the slope of the fits are identical for the
two separate peaks of the ab-plane line shape 1.21 ± 0.02. If we
_assume_ that the hyperfine coupling is isotropic and does not depend on
direction (i.e., $A_{\rm H}^{c}=A_{\rm H}^{\rm eff}$), the anisotropy of
the spin susceptibility may be estimated as
$\chi_{\rm spin}^{ab}/\chi_{\rm spin}^{c}=1.21\pm 0.02$.

Let us turn our attention to the temperature dependence of
$\chi_{\rm spin}$ as reflected by ⁷⁷K measurements. In the normal state
above T_(c), $\chi_{\rm spin}$ decreases monotonically with temperature.
Similar behavior was previously reported for many iron-based
superconductors, including LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x),[28, 51]
Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂,[21, 32, 33, 34] and FeSe.[20] In addition,
close inspection of Fig. 4 reveals that the curvature of ⁷⁷K changes
from positive to negative around 200 K and hence $\chi_{\rm spin}$ may
be gradually saturating at higher temperatures. We observe an analogous
tendency in the temperature dependence of 1/T₁T as shown below. Overall,
the temperature dependence of $\chi_{\rm spin}$ in the present case is
similar to that of LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x).[28, 51]

The mechanism of the suppression of $\chi_{\rm spin}$ above T_(c) has
been highly controversial. In view of the proximity between the
superconducting and spin-density wave (SDW) ordered states in the phase
diagram of iron-based systems, it is natural to speculate that
antiferromagnetic short-range order may be growing toward T_(c) and
suppressing $\chi_{\rm spin}$.[32] Early observation of the enhancement
of short-range antiferromagnetic spin correlations near T_(c) by the
measurements of 1/T₁T in the optimally doped superconducting phase also
seem to support such a scenario.[21, 35] On the other hand, even the
heavily overdoped, nonsuperconducting, nonmagnetic metallic phase
Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ with Co concentrations as high as 20

Since the SDW phase is located far away from the overdoped regime in the
electronic phase diagram, the latter observation may point toward other
scenarios such as the change of the effective density of states of
low-energy spin excitations. In canonical Fermi liquid systems, if the
chemical potential μ is located on the lower energy side of a sharp peak
of the density of states, $\chi_{\rm spin}$ could decrease at lower
temperatures when N^(*)(μ) becomes smaller. In this scenario, our
results in Fig. 4 imply that there is a large, sharp peak of N^(*)(E)
somewhat above the Fermi energy E_(F). Recalling the mild saturating
tendency of ⁷⁷K above 200 K (∼18 meV), such a peak may be located fairly
close to E_(F). However, the recent ARPES measurements[16] do not seem
to indicate the presence of such a peak.

Alternatively, if one believes that the temperature dependence of
$\chi_{\rm spin}$ is dominated by frustration effects between nearest
and next-nearest neighbor Fe-Fe exchange interactions, it is conceivable
that more exotic _pseudogap_-like behavior emerges upon cooling the
system. We may deduce such a phenomenological pseudogap by fitting the
spin contribution ${}^{77}K_{\rm spin}$ to an activation form
${}^{77}K_{\rm spin}={}^{77}K-^{77}K_{\rm chem}\sim\exp(-\Delta/k_{B}T)$
(as shown by a solid curve in Fig. 4). Notice that our phenomenological
fit successfully reproduces the saturating tendency of ⁷⁷K_(c) near 290
K as well. The best fit of our data from T_(c) to 290 K yields
Δ/k_(B) = 435 K. This value is comparable to the previous estimate of
Δ/k_(B) = 450-711 K in Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂,[33, 34] and much
greater than Δ/k_(B) = 140-172 K in LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x).[31, 36]

Below T_(c), ⁷⁷K suddenly begins to decrease from ⁷⁷K_(c) ∼ 0.25

In order to estimate the magnitude and symmetry of the superconducting
energy gap from the temperature dependence of ⁷⁷K_(c) below T_(c), one
needs to estimate the diamagnetic effects, a formidable task in many
superconductors.[37] Our application of as high as 8.3 T of magnetic
field may also skew the temperature dependence of ⁷⁷K_(c) to some extent
by destroying the Cooper pairs. We would need a much larger NMR signal
intensity to conduct NMR measurements below T_(c) at lower magnetic
fields. By ignoring all these potential complications, and assuming the
same magnitude of isotropic energy gaps for all pieces of the Fermi
surface sheets, we attempted to fit the low-temperature behavior of
⁷⁷K_(c) with an activation law
${}^{77}K_{\rm spin}\sim\exp(-\Delta_{\rm sc}/k_{B}T)$. A provisional
estimate of the superconducting energy gap is
$\Delta_{\rm sc}/k_{B}\sim 92$ K, hence we obtain a much larger ratio
$\Delta_{\rm sc}/k_{B}T_{c}\sim 2.8$ than the BCS value of 1.76. The
comparatively large gap should be taken with a grain of salt in view of
the level of uncertainty in our estimation of $K_{\rm chem}\sim 0.11$

### Low energy spin excitations as measured by NMR spin-lattice
relaxation rate 1/t₁

Figure 6 presents the temperature dependence of the ⁷⁷Se nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation rate ⁷⁷(1/T₁) measured in B_(c) = 8.3 T applied
along the c axis. Preliminary measurements in B_(ab) = 8.3 T applied
along the ab plane showed nearly identical behavior at least up to 160
K. ⁷⁷(1/T₁) dives below T_(c) without exhibiting a Hebel-Slichter
coherence peak expected for conventional isotropic BCS s-wave
superconductors. Due to the extremely poor signal-to-noise ratio well
below T_(c) (see the line shape at 8 K in Fig. 2), we did not attempt to
follow the temperature dependence of ⁷⁷(1/T₁) to much below T_(c). In
any event, vortex motions and additional relaxation processes at the
normal vortex cores generally make the interpretation of the high-field
NMR measurements of 1/T₁ a highly complicated affair well below
T_(c).[38] Analogous behavior of 1/T₁ immediately below T_(c) was
previously reported for many other iron-based high T_(c)
superconductors.[20, 21, 31, 39, 40, 41, 31] We reproduce some of our
earlier results in Fig. 5 for comparison.

Mazin _et al._ pointed out that the lack of the Hebel-Slichter coherence
peak does not necessarily mean that these systems are unconventional
superconductors with line or point nodes in the superconducting energy
gaps.[43] That is, even if the energy gaps are fully open, alteration of
the sign of the superconducting energy gaps between different pieces of
the Fermi surface could lead to annihilation of the coherence peak in
the so-called s_(±) states. They considered several s_(±) states in the
context of LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x), which has both electron Fermi surfaces
near the zone edge and the hole Fermi surfaces at the zone center. In
the present case, recent ARPES measurements suggest that the hole Fermi
surface at the zone center is completely filled by doped electrons and
only electron Fermi surfaces exist at zone edges.[16] Within the s_(±)
scenario, our observation of the lack of the coherence peak therefore
requires sign reversal of the energy gap between the adjacent pieces of
the electron Fermi surface at zone edges. This requires a twofold
symmetry in the crystal structure, and vacancy ordering may be playing a
key role in lowering the tetragonal symmetry as discussed above.

Presented in Fig. 7 is the temperature dependence of ⁷⁷(1/T₁T), that is,
⁷⁷(1/T₁T) divided by temperature T. Quite generally, ⁷⁷(1/T₁T) measures
the q summation of the imaginary part of the dynamical electron-spin
susceptibility weighted by the hyperfine form factor
$|A_{\rm hf}(\mathbf{q})|^{2}$,

$$1/T_{1}T\propto\sum_{\mathbf{q}\in{\rm B.Z.}}|A_{\rm hf}(\mathbf{q})|^{2}\frac{ \chi^{\prime\prime}(\mathbf{q},f_{\rm NMR})}{f_{\rm NMR}},$$
(5)

where $f_{\rm NMR}$ is the NMR frequency. In other words, ⁷⁷(1/T₁T)
probes various q modes of the low-frequency spin fluctuations at the
low-energy scale ($hf_{\rm NMR}$) set by the NMR frequency. Our results
show that ⁷⁷(1/T₁T) decreases with temperature from 290 K down to T_(c).
The observed temperature dependence is qualitatively similar to that of
⁷⁷K, including the mild saturating tendency near 290 K. Since ⁷⁷(1/T₁T)
measures all wave-vector q modes of spin fluctuations while ⁷⁷K picks up
the uniform q = 0 mode exclusively, there is no a priori reason to
expect such analogous behaviors. In fact, in many iron-based high T_(c)
superconductors 1/T₁T and K exhibit qualitatively different temperature
dependencies near T_(c).

For comparison we present ⁷⁷(1/T₁T) observed for FeSe[20] in Fig. 7(a)
and ⁷⁵(1/T₁T) measured at ⁷⁵As sites in two representative compositions
of Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂[34] in Fig. 7(b), 1/T₁T is enhanced toward
T_(c) in both FeSe (T_(c) = 9 K) and the optimally doped
Ba(Fe_(0.92)Co_(0.08))₂As₂ (T_(c) = 25 K), even though the uniform q = 0
mode of spin susceptibility stays nearly flat near T_(c) in these
systems. This enhancement of 1/T₁T near T_(c) provides evidence for
enhancement of the low-frequency components of the antiferromagnetic
spin fluctuations (AFSF) toward T_(c) at some finite wave vectors in
FeSe and Ba(Fe_(0.92)Co_(0.08))₂As₂. In contrast, our results indicate
that this is not the case in K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂. Instead, our results
are qualitatively similar to overdoped, nonsupercondcting

Figure 7: (Color online) (a) The temperature dependence of ⁷⁷(1/T₁T)
observed for K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ is compared with the results for FeSe in
0 GPa (T_(c) = 9 K) and 0.7 GPa (T_(c) = 14 K in 0.7 GPa).[30] (b)
Representative results of ⁷⁵(1/T₁T) observed at ⁷⁵As sites of
Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ with x = 0.08 (T_(c) = 25 K) and x = 0.14
(T_(c) ∼ 0 K) with an external magnetic field applied along the ab
plane.[34] Notice the qualitative similarity between K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂
and the overdoped Ba(Fe_(0.86)Co_(0.14))₂As₂; both of these materials
lack the hole bands near the zone center.

Ba(Fe_(0.86)Co_(0.14))₂As₂ [as shown in Fig. 7(b)]. The absence of AFSF
in the latter was interpreted as the consequence of the lack of the
nested Fermi surfaces between the hole and electron bands, because the
overdoped electrons fill up the hole bands at the zone center.[34] Since
ARPES data suggest that K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ does not possess a hole Fermi
surface near the B.Z. center, the absence of low-frequency AFSF itself
may be consistent with such an interpretation. However, our results
inevitably raise the question of whether the lowfrequency components of
AFSF are relevant to the superconducting mechanism. Needless to say, our
NMR results do not exclude the possibility that AFSF is being enhanced
at higher energies than $hf_{\rm NMR}$, and such modes may be related to
the superconducting mechanism. We also caution that the signature of a
mild enhancement of AFSF toward T_(c) for a finite ${\bf q}$ mode could
be easily masked, if the overwhelmingly large background contributions
from all other ${\bf q}$ modes keep decreasing toward T_(c).

Finally, let us re-examine more global features of ⁷⁷(1/T₁T) and ⁷⁷K
above T_(c) up to 290 K in light of the qualitative similarity in their
temperature dependencies. A possible explanation for the similar
behavior is that ⁷⁷(1/T₁T) as well as ⁷⁷K is dominated by the effective
density of states N^(*)(μ) at the chemical potential of a Fermi liquid.
Since ⁷⁷(1/T₁T) ∝ [N^(*)(μ)]² and
${}^{77}K_{\rm spin}\propto N^{*}(\mu)$, one would expect a _Korringa
relation_${}^{77}(1/T_{1}T)^{0.5}\propto^{77}K_{\rm spin}$, for a Fermi
liquid. To test such a scenario, we plot ⁷⁷(1/T₁T)^(0.5) as a function
of ⁷⁷K in Fig. 8 by choosing temperature as the implicit parameter. It
is not impossible to draw a straight line through all the data points
above T_(c), as shown by a dashed line. However, our high precision data
deviate consistently from the straight line with a negative curvature.
In addition, an extrapolation of the straight line yields the intercept
of the horizontal axis at ⁷⁷K ∼ 0.04%. That is, the Korringa relation
for a Fermi liquid would require $K_{\rm chem}\sim 0.04\%$, which seems
low compared with our experimental results near the base temperature
⁷⁷K_(c) = 0.11 ± 0.01%. An alternative scaling form to account for the
similarity in the temperature dependence of ⁷⁷(1/T₁T) and ⁷⁷K would be
${}^{77}(1/T_{1}T)\propto^{77}K_{\rm spin}$ for nearly ferromagnetic
Fermi liquid, but our plot in Fig. 8 shows that this relation fails
completely. This is not surprising after all, strong ferromagnetic
correlation would result in enhancement of ⁷⁷K with decreasing
temperature. Instead, if we float two parameters the power n as well as
$K_{\rm chem}$ in the dynamical scaling form of
${}^{77}(1/T_{1}T)=(^{77}K_{\rm spin,c})^{n}=(^{77}K_{c}-K_{\rm chem})^{n}$
we obtain n ∼ 1.6 and $K_{\rm chem}\sim 0.12\%$ rather than the Fermi
liquid value of n = 2. The solid curves in Fig. 8 show the scaling fits.

## IV Summary and conclusions

In this paper we have reported a thorough and detailed investigation of
the structural, electronic, and superconducting properties of the newly
discovered high-T_(c) superconductor K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ using ⁷⁷Se NMR
techniques. While the details of the spatial arrangements of the K and
Fe defects are still unknown, our NMR line shapes suggest that
tetragonal fourfold symmetry is broken down at Se sites (at least
locally) and twofold symmetry in the local crystal structure may be
induced by the formation of a defect superstructure. In addition, it is
worth noting that we found no evidence for coexistence of magnetically
ordered phase in our NMR line shapes because NMR lines are very sharp
and exhibit paramagnetic behavior.

Electronic properties in the normal state above T_(c) share many common
traits with the low T_(c) superconductor FeSe as well as with
iron-arsenide high-T_(c) superconductors. For example, the uniform spin
susceptibility decreases with temperature toward T_(c) as observed for
all other iron-arsenide high-T_(c) systems as well as for FeSe. In view
of the closeness of the power n ∼ 1.6 in the dynamical scaling analysis
of ⁷⁷(1/T₁T) vs ${}^{77}K_{\rm spin}$ to the Fermi liquid value of
n = 2, our results in Fig. 7 likely imply a suppression of spin
excitations in a broad range of wave vector ${\bf q}$, with a possible
pseudogap-like excitation gap Δ/k_(B) ∼ 435 K. These NMR results are
qualitatively similar to the overdoped nonsuperconducting system
Ba(Fe_(0.84)Co_(0.16))₂As₂, and we do not find evidence for the
enhancement of AFSF near T_(c). In this context it may be important to
recall that the presence of AFSF in the low-T_(c) superconductor FeSe
was not easy to detect because defects of only a few percent could wipe
out the signature of AFSF while reducing the volume fraction of
superconductivity.[8, 20, 42] Moreover, if one reduces the Co
concentration of Ba(Fe_(0.84)Co_(0.16))₂As₂ by just a few percent, a
robust signature of AFSF emerges with progressively larger volume
fractions of superconductivity as one approaches the optimal doping
concentration x ∼ 0.07.[34] Given that the defect concentrations of K
and Fe and their spatial coordination have not been fully controlled,
and that the specific heat anomaly has not been observed at T_(c) in our
sample, we need to interpret the implications of our NMR results with
caution.

Turning our attention to superconductivity we extracted the London
penetration depth λ_(ab) ∼ 290 nm and the carrier concentration
n_(s) ∼ 1 × 10⁺²¹ cm⁻³ based on the NMR line

Figure 8: The normal state data of ⁷⁷(1/T₁T) and its square-root
⁷⁷(1/T₁T)^(0.5) are compared with ⁷⁷K_(c) by choosing temperature as the
implicit parameter. The dashed line represents a possible Korringa
relation. Solid curves represent free parameter fits with
${}^{77}(1/T_{1}T)=(^{7}K_{c}-K_{\rm chem})^{n}$ which yields n ∼ 1.6
instead of the Fermi liquid value of n ∼ 2.

broadening below T_(c) induced by the Abrikosov lattice. We also found
that the NMR Knight shift decreases below T_(c) for both magnetic field
applied along the crystal c axis and the ab plane. In addition, we
showed that there is no Hebel-Slichter coherence peak in the temperature
dependence of 1/T₁ just below T_(c). These results are consistent with
singlet pairing of Cooper pairs with the s_(±) symmetry. However, lack
of accurate data well below T_(c) prevents us from ruling out the
possibility of anisotropic pairing.

During the course of the present study Yu _et al._ posted a preprint and
reported their NMR investigation of KFe_(2 − γ)Se₂ in a limited
temperature range above T_(c).[18] Their NMR data in the normal state
agree reasonably well with our results in the overlapped temperature
range. Subsequently, during the final stage of the present work, two
preprints appeared. First, Ma (Yu _et al_. posted an additional
preprint) reported an extension of their work to below T_(c) with
primary emphasis on 1/T₁ measured in a high magnetic field.[44] Kotegawa
and co-workers also extended the earlier measurements to a broader
temperature range.[45]
