###### Abstract

Recently a new family of Cr-based A_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} (A = K, Rb, Cs) superconductors was reported, which own a rare quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) crystal structure with infinite (Cr_{3}As_{3})^{2-} chains and exhibit intriguing superconducting characteristics possibly derived from spin-triplet electron pairing. The crystal structure of A_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} is actually a slight variation of the hexagonal TlFe_{3}Te_{3} prototype, although they have different lattice symmetry. Here we report superconductivity in a 133-type KCr_{3}As_{3} compound that belongs to the latter structure. The single crystals of KCr_{3}As_{3} were prepared by the deintercalation of K ions from K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} crystals which were grown from a high-temperature solution growth method, and it owns a centrosymmetric lattice in contrast to the noncentrosymmetric K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}. After annealing at a moderate temperature, the KCr_{3}As_{3} crystals show superconductivity at 5 K revealed by electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity measurements. The discovery of this KCr_{3}As_{3} superconductor provides a different structural instance to study the exotic superconductivity in these Q1D Cr-based superconductors.

The recently discovered Cr-based superconductors A_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} (A = K, Rb, Cs) have attracted much interest besides the enthusiasm on Fe-based high-T_{\rm c} superconductors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. This is partly because there have been very few Cr-containing compounds exhibiting superconductivity for a century. Except for several binary Cr alloys [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], the only superconductors are the lately reported ternary boride Cr_{2}Re_{3}B which has a noncentrosymmetric \beta-Mn-type crystal structure and a T_{\rm c} of 4.8 K [12], and the binary CrAs which exhibits superconductivity at 2 K by suppressing the antiferromagnetic order via the application of external high pressures above 8 kbar [13, 14]. Furthermore, these 233-type A_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} compounds crystallize in a very particular quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) hexagonal crystal lattice with a space group of \hat{P}\hat{\Theta}m2 (No. 187), which can be regarded as infinite Q1D (Cr_{3}As_{3})^{2-} linear chains separated by alkali-metal cations that act as a charge reservoir [1, 2, 3, 15]. When replacing the K^{+} ions with larger Rb^{+} or Cs^{+} ions, the superconducting T_{\rm c} decreases dramatically from 6.1 K to 4.8 and 2.2 K, respectively [1, 2, 3, 15, 16], and the T_{\rm c} also monotonically decreases under external pressures in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}[16, 17]. Theoretical calculations on K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} predict a complex multiband electronic structure with a three-dimensional Fermi-surface pocket in addition to two Q1D Fermi-surface sheets mainly contributed by the Cr-3d electrons [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Experimental results show strong electron correlations and magnetic fluctuations but very diverse pictures of ground states, and both spin-triplet and spin-singlet electron pairing are proposed to explain the exotic superconductivity [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. As a rare case of Q1D superconductors, A_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} is significantly different from previously reported Q1D superconductors such as Li_{0.9}Mo_{6}O_{7}[31, 32, 33], Tl_{2}Mo_{6}Se_{6}[33], and organic superconductors (TMTSF)_{2} (TMTSF = tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene, X = PF_{6} or ClO_{4}) [34, 35, 36, 37].

By deintercalating half of the K ions from the K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} lattice, a new type of Q1D compound KCr_{3}As_{3} can be obtained [38]. This 133-type KCr_{3}As_{3} has a hexagonal TlFe_{3}Te_{3}-type crystal structure with the space group P_{6}/m (No. 176) [38]. Unlike its 233-type cousins which lack inversion symmetry, the KCr_{3}As_{3} has a centrosymmetric crystal lattice. Although the characteristic Cr_{3}As_{3} linear chain structures are similar between the two compounds except for a small-angle rotation along the c axis, removing a K^{+} ion per formula from K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} increases the chemical valence state of Cr and turns the Q1D chains into (Cr_{3}As_{3})^{-} type in the KCr_{3}As_{3} lattice. Previous experimental studies on polycrystalline KCr_{3}As_{3} showed cluster spin-glass ground state without superconductivity at low temperature [38], and the density functional theory first-principles calculations exhibited a magnetic Fermi surface involving only three one-dimensional sheets with much reduced dimensionality and the emergence of the interlayer antiferromagnetic order [39].

In this Rapid Communication, we report the discovery of superconductivity in the single crystals of KCr_{3}As_{3} with a T_{c} of 5 K.

The 133-type KCr_{3}As_{3} single crystals were prepared by the deintercalation of K^{+} ions from K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} precursors. At first, high-quality single crystals of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} were grown out of a KAs and CrAs mixture using a high-temperature solution growth method as previously reported [1]. Then the as-grown rodlike K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} single crystals were immersed in pure dehydrated ethanol and kept for 1 wk for the deintercalation of K^{+} ions at room temperature. The obtained samples were washed by ethanol thoroughly and labeled as sample A. To further improve the sample quality, the crystals of sample A were immersed in ethanol in a Teflon liner and loaded into an autoclave. The autoclave was tightly sealed, and sintered at 353 K for 100 h. After cooled down to room temperature, the obtained samples were washed with ethanol again and annealed in an evacuated quartz tube at 373 K for 12 h. These final postannealed KCr_{3}As_{3} crystals were labeled as sample B. All the experimental procedures were carried out in a glovebox filled with high-purity Ar gas to avoid introducing impurities. The obtained KCr_{3}As_{3} crystals are stable in air at room  temperature, but it decomposes above a moderate temperature at 473 K. Due to this reason, our direct synthesis of KCl_{3}As_{3} polycrystals from solid-state reaction or single-crystal growth from high-temperature solutions all failed. For comparison, we also reproduced polycrystalline KCr_{3}As_{3} samples by the deintercalation process from K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} powders which were synthesized by a solid-state reaction method as reported [38].

The crystal structure of all samples was characterized by powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) at room temperature with a PAN-analytical x-ray diffractometer using Cu K\alpha radiation. The electrical resistivity and heat capacity were measured in a Quantum Design physical property measurement system by the standard four-probe method and relaxation method, respectively. The dc magnetization was measured in a Quantum Design magnetic property measurement system under zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling modes.

The hexagonal crystal structure of the 133-type KCr_{3}As_{3} is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). Due to the obvious lattice shrinkage along the a axis during the ion deintercalation process (about 8.9% from the K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} precursor), the crystals of KCr_{3}As_{3} split into threadlike filaments with micrometer-size diameters and millimeter-size lengths as shown by the scanning electron microscope image in Fig. 1(b), differing from the solid rodlike K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} crystal. This crystal morphology makes it incapable for a fully single-crystal x-ray diffraction analysis for structural determination; hence PXRD is employed for structural study. Figure 1(c) shows the XRD patterns for three samples, which reveal consistent diffraction peaks with identical crystal structure. The XRD patterns of the polycrystalline sample indicate a pure single phase of the 133 structure, as indicated by the vertical bars of theoretical calculations for Bragg peak positions. The lattice parameters were refined to be a=9.092(1) A, c=4.180(6) A using the P6_{3}/m (No. 176) space group, close to the previous results [38]. For the annealed single crystals of sample B, the XRD patterns on the crystal side surface only show the peaks of (hk0) since the sample is threadlike along the c axis. To determine the lattice parameters, sample B was ground together with silicon powder (which acts as both an abrader and an internal standard) and the PXRD patterns show several additional diffraction peaks relevant to the c axis. We note that the KCr_{3}As_{3} crystal has good ductility and it is difficult to make a fine powder, therefore the diffraction peaks still have a highly preferred orientation. The refined lattice parameters for sample B are a=9.090(8) A and c=4.182(9) A, which are very close to the results of polycrystalline samples. In addition, no obvious difference in XRD patterns for sample A and sample B was observed; and in all deintercalated samples, no diffraction peak from a possible remnant K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} phase was detected. The energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy measurements on the crystal surface of sample B also show a 133-type ingredient with no 233 phase detected, as indicated by the "+" marks in Fig. 1(b).

The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity was characterized from 1.8 to 300 K for all samples and the data are shown in Fig. 2. In our experiments, all batches of KCr_{3}As_{3} single crystals show superconducting transitions with resistivity dropping to zero at low temperatures. But for the polycrystalline samples, no superconductivity was observed as previously reported [38]. In Fig. 2(a), we compared the resistivity behavior between the single crystals of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} and KCr_{3}As_{3} (both sample A and sample B). The room-temperature resistivity values are close for all these samples,

The triangles represent Bragg peaks from Si, and the vertical bars represent the position of calculated Bragg peaks.

(d) Derived upper critical field and the Pauli paramagnetic limit for sample B.

  but the residual resistance ratio of KCr_{3}As_{3} (\sim3 for sample B) is much smaller than that of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} (\sim60), indicating the poor crystalline quality of KCr_{3}As_{3} crystals. This can be explained by the crystal defects and lattice deformation in the KCr_{3}As_{3} crystal induced by the deintercalation process around room temperature, which also make the sample A semiconducting-like behavior below 100 K, while after annealing, the crystal quality becomes better and it shows a metallic resistivity behavior for sample B. This can be further illustrated by the superconducting transition as shown in Fig. 2(b). Sample A shows a wide superconducting transition and an onset T_{c}\sim 4.5 K, while sample B shows a much narrower superconducting transition with a higher onset T_{c}\sim 5.0 K, and both values are lower than the T_{c}\sim 6.0 K of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}.

To further characterize the superconducting properties, we performed resistivity measurements on sample B under constant magnetic fields from 0 to 9 T with sweeping temperature to study the upper critical field H_{c2} (with the field perpendicular to the c axis), and the normalized data for \rho/\rho_{6.8} vs T are shown in Fig. 2(c). With magnetic field increasing, the T_{c} shifts to lower temperatures systematically. We define the \mu_{0}H_{c2} as the field determined by 50% of the normal-state resistivity at T_{c}, and it was depicted as a function of temperature in Fig. 2(d). Considering the Ginzburg-Landau theory, \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T)=\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)(1-t^{2})/(1+t^{2}), here t=T/T_{c}, the zero-temperature upper critical field \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) is estimated to be 20.8 T. This value is much higher than the Pauli paramagnetic limited upper critical field \mu_{0}H_{p}=1.84T_{c}\approx 8.6 T [40], which gives evidence for unconventional superconductivity in KCr_{3}As_{3}, and a similar phenomenon was also reported in Li_{0.9}Mo_{6}O_{17}[41], Sr_{2}RuO_{4}[42], and K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} superconductors [1].

To demonstrate whether the observed superconductivity is the bulk nature of the K-133 phase or from a possible minor remnant K-233 phase which cannot be detected by XRD, the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity were characterized and shown in Fig. 3. Under a magnetic field of 10 Oe (perpendicular to the c axis), samples A and B show a clear diamagnetic superconducting transition at 3.7 and 4.7 K, respectively. Whereas, the shielding volume fraction at 2 K from the ZFC data is only about 9% for sample A, and it is significantly enhanced to nearly 98% for sample B. This is consistent with the behavior of a resistive superconducting transition. The results indicate that sample A only shows very poor superconductivity with a small superconducting fraction, while after annealing, as the crystal lattice is reformed, sample B becomes a good superconductor. For the normal-state susceptibility of sample B, it roughly coincides with the Curie-Weiss behavior with no magnetic ordering transition. In Fig. 3(c) we show the isothermal magnetization curve of sample B with respect to a magnetic field from -5 to 5 T at 2 K, and it reveals typical type-II superconductivity in single-crystalline KCr_{3}As_{3}.

The temperature dependence of heat capacity is plotted in Fig. 3(d) as a relationship for C_{p}/T vs T^{2}. The normal-state data are linearly fitted with both electron and phonon contributions by C_{p}/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2} with T above T_{c}, from which we obtain the Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma as 81.31 mJ/(mol K^{2}), and Debye temperature \theta_{D} as 319 K calculated according to \theta_{D}=[(1/5)\text{N}\pi^{4}/\beta]^{1/3}. Comparing with K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}, the close \gamma values indicate similar strong electron correlations, while the higher \theta_{D} is reasonably originated from the condensed crystal lattice for KCr_{3}As_{3}[1,16]. The clear heat capacity jump in the C_{p} curve happens at about 5 K. This indicates the occurrence of a superconducting transition and further confirms the superconductivity of KCr_{3}As_{3} single crystals, which is consistent with the results of resistivity and magnetization measurements. We note that the value of the heat capacity jump \Delta C_{p}/\gamma T_{c} is about 0.47, which is much smaller than that of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}[1]; this is probably due to the low sample quality by remaining crystal defects which are not fully removed during the annealing process with the relatively low annealing temperature of only 373 K. To further exclude the possibility of a remnant K-233 superconducting phase inside the crystals, the powders of mashed K-133 single crystals were exposed in air for several days and no clear change was observed for the superconducting diamagnetism. This is distinctly different from the K-233 powders which are extremely reactive and burn immediately when exposed in air. The similar superconducting and electronic characteristics in KCr_{3}As_{3} and K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} possibly indicate same electron pairing mechanism that derives from a different lattice symmetry, and the lack of superconductivity in polycrystalline KCr_{3}As_{3} and the annealing effects for single crystals reveal the extreme sensitivity of superconductivity by disorders in the crystal lattice.

In summary, we synthesized the 133-type KCr_{3}As_{3} single crystals, and found superconductivity at a T_{c} of 5.0 K. This compound has a centrosymmetric crystal structure differing from its noncentrosymmetric counterpart K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}. Considering similar superconducting characteristics but different crystal symmetry between the two superconductors, this KCr_{3}As_{3} provides another platform to acquire deep insight into the unconventional superconducting mechanism in these Q1D Cr-based superconductors.

###### Abstract

Recently a new family of Cr-based A_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} (A = K, Rb, Cs) superconductors was reported, which own a rare quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) crystal structure with infinite (Cr_{3}As_{3})^{2-} chains and exhibit intriguing superconducting characteristics possibly derived from spin-triplet electron pairing. The crystal structure of A_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} is actually a slight variation of the hexagonal TlFe_{3}Te_{3} prototype, although they have different lattice symmetry. Here we report superconductivity in a 133-type KCr_{3}As_{3} compound that belongs to the latter structure. The single crystals of KCr_{3}As_{3} were prepared by the deintercalation of K ions from K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} crystals which were grown from a high-temperature solution growth method, and it owns a centrosymmetric lattice in contrast to the noncentrosymmetric K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}. After annealing at a moderate temperature, the KCr_{3}As_{3} crystals show superconductivity at 5 K revealed by electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity measurements. The discovery of this KCr_{3}As_{3} superconductor provides a different structural instance to study the exotic superconductivity in these Q1D Cr-based superconductors.

The recently discovered Cr-based superconductors A_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} (A = K, Rb, Cs) have attracted much interest besides the enthusiasm on Fe-based high-T_{\rm c} superconductors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. This is partly because there have been very few Cr-containing compounds exhibiting superconductivity for a century. Except for several binary Cr alloys [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], the only superconductors are the lately reported ternary boride Cr_{2}Re_{3}B which has a noncentrosymmetric \beta-Mn-type crystal structure and a T_{\rm c} of 4.8 K [12], and the binary CrAs which exhibits superconductivity at 2 K by suppressing the antiferromagnetic order via the application of external high pressures above 8 kbar [13, 14]. Furthermore, these 233-type A_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} compounds crystallize in a very particular quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) hexagonal crystal lattice with a space group of \hat{P}\hat{\Theta}m2 (No. 187), which can be regarded as infinite Q1D (Cr_{3}As_{3})^{2-} linear chains separated by alkali-metal cations that act as a charge reservoir [1, 2, 3, 15]. When replacing the K^{+} ions with larger Rb^{+} or Cs^{+} ions, the superconducting T_{\rm c} decreases dramatically from 6.1 K to 4.8 and 2.2 K, respectively [1, 2, 3, 15, 16], and the T_{\rm c} also monotonically decreases under external pressures in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}[16, 17]. Theoretical calculations on K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} predict a complex multiband electronic structure with a three-dimensional Fermi-surface pocket in addition to two Q1D Fermi-surface sheets mainly contributed by the Cr-3d electrons [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Experimental results show strong electron correlations and magnetic fluctuations but very diverse pictures of ground states, and both spin-triplet and spin-singlet electron pairing are proposed to explain the exotic superconductivity [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. As a rare case of Q1D superconductors, A_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} is significantly different from previously reported Q1D superconductors such as Li_{0.9}Mo_{6}O_{7}[31, 32, 33], Tl_{2}Mo_{6}Se_{6}[33], and organic superconductors (TMTSF)_{2} (TMTSF = tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene, X = PF_{6} or ClO_{4}) [34, 35, 36, 37].

By deintercalating half of the K ions from the K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} lattice, a new type of Q1D compound KCr_{3}As_{3} can be obtained [38]. This 133-type KCr_{3}As_{3} has a hexagonal TlFe_{3}Te_{3}-type crystal structure with the space group P_{6}/m (No. 176) [38]. Unlike its 233-type cousins which lack inversion symmetry, the KCr_{3}As_{3} has a centrosymmetric crystal lattice. Although the characteristic Cr_{3}As_{3} linear chain structures are similar between the two compounds except for a small-angle rotation along the c axis, removing a K^{+} ion per formula from K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} increases the chemical valence state of Cr and turns the Q1D chains into (Cr_{3}As_{3})^{-} type in the KCr_{3}As_{3} lattice. Previous experimental studies on polycrystalline KCr_{3}As_{3} showed cluster spin-glass ground state without superconductivity at low temperature [38], and the density functional theory first-principles calculations exhibited a magnetic Fermi surface involving only three one-dimensional sheets with much reduced dimensionality and the emergence of the interlayer antiferromagnetic order [39].

In this Rapid Communication, we report the discovery of superconductivity in the single crystals of KCr_{3}As_{3} with a T_{c} of 5 K.

The 133-type KCr_{3}As_{3} single crystals were prepared by the deintercalation of K^{+} ions from K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} precursors. At first, high-quality single crystals of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} were grown out of a KAs and CrAs mixture using a high-temperature solution growth method as previously reported [1]. Then the as-grown rodlike K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} single crystals were immersed in pure dehydrated ethanol and kept for 1 wk for the deintercalation of K^{+} ions at room temperature. The obtained samples were washed by ethanol thoroughly and labeled as sample A. To further improve the sample quality, the crystals of sample A were immersed in ethanol in a Teflon liner and loaded into an autoclave. The autoclave was tightly sealed, and sintered at 353 K for 100 h. After cooled down to room temperature, the obtained samples were washed with ethanol again and annealed in an evacuated quartz tube at 373 K for 12 h. These final postannealed KCr_{3}As_{3} crystals were labeled as sample B. All the experimental procedures were carried out in a glovebox filled with high-purity Ar gas to avoid introducing impurities. The obtained KCr_{3}As_{3} crystals are stable in air at room  temperature, but it decomposes above a moderate temperature at 473 K. Due to this reason, our direct synthesis of KCl_{3}As_{3} polycrystals from solid-state reaction or single-crystal growth from high-temperature solutions all failed. For comparison, we also reproduced polycrystalline KCr_{3}As_{3} samples by the deintercalation process from K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} powders which were synthesized by a solid-state reaction method as reported [38].

The crystal structure of all samples was characterized by powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) at room temperature with a PAN-analytical x-ray diffractometer using Cu K\alpha radiation. The electrical resistivity and heat capacity were measured in a Quantum Design physical property measurement system by the standard four-probe method and relaxation method, respectively. The dc magnetization was measured in a Quantum Design magnetic property measurement system under zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling modes.

The hexagonal crystal structure of the 133-type KCr_{3}As_{3} is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). Due to the obvious lattice shrinkage along the a axis during the ion deintercalation process (about 8.9% from the K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} precursor), the crystals of KCr_{3}As_{3} split into threadlike filaments with micrometer-size diameters and millimeter-size lengths as shown by the scanning electron microscope image in Fig. 1(b), differing from the solid rodlike K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} crystal. This crystal morphology makes it incapable for a fully single-crystal x-ray diffraction analysis for structural determination; hence PXRD is employed for structural study. Figure 1(c) shows the XRD patterns for three samples, which reveal consistent diffraction peaks with identical crystal structure. The XRD patterns of the polycrystalline sample indicate a pure single phase of the 133 structure, as indicated by the vertical bars of theoretical calculations for Bragg peak positions. The lattice parameters were refined to be a=9.092(1) A, c=4.180(6) A using the P6_{3}/m (No. 176) space group, close to the previous results [38]. For the annealed single crystals of sample B, the XRD patterns on the crystal side surface only show the peaks of (hk0) since the sample is threadlike along the c axis. To determine the lattice parameters, sample B was ground together with silicon powder (which acts as both an abrader and an internal standard) and the PXRD patterns show several additional diffraction peaks relevant to the c axis. We note that the KCr_{3}As_{3} crystal has good ductility and it is difficult to make a fine powder, therefore the diffraction peaks still have a highly preferred orientation. The refined lattice parameters for sample B are a=9.090(8) A and c=4.182(9) A, which are very close to the results of polycrystalline samples. In addition, no obvious difference in XRD patterns for sample A and sample B was observed; and in all deintercalated samples, no diffraction peak from a possible remnant K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} phase was detected. The energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy measurements on the crystal surface of sample B also show a 133-type ingredient with no 233 phase detected, as indicated by the "+" marks in Fig. 1(b).

The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity was characterized from 1.8 to 300 K for all samples and the data are shown in Fig. 2. In our experiments, all batches of KCr_{3}As_{3} single crystals show superconducting transitions with resistivity dropping to zero at low temperatures. But for the polycrystalline samples, no superconductivity was observed as previously reported [38]. In Fig. 2(a), we compared the resistivity behavior between the single crystals of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} and KCr_{3}As_{3} (both sample A and sample B). The room-temperature resistivity values are close for all these samples,

(c) The XRD patterns for three KCr_{3}As_{3} samples: (1) crystals of sample B, (2) ground powder of sample B mixed with Si, and (3) polycrystalline sample. The triangles represent Bragg peaks from Si, and the vertical bars represent the position of calculated Bragg peaks.

(d) Derived upper critical field and the Pauli paramagnetic limit for sample B.

  but the residual resistance ratio of KCr_{3}As_{3} (\sim3 for sample B) is much smaller than that of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} (\sim60), indicating the poor crystalline quality of KCr_{3}As_{3} crystals. This can be explained by the crystal defects and lattice deformation in the KCr_{3}As_{3} crystal induced by the deintercalation process around room temperature, which also make the sample A semiconducting-like behavior below 100 K, while after annealing, the crystal quality becomes better and it shows a metallic resistivity behavior for sample B. This can be further illustrated by the superconducting transition as shown in Fig. 2(b). Sample A shows a wide superconducting transition and an onset T_{c}\sim 4.5 K, while sample B shows a much narrower superconducting transition with a higher onset T_{c}\sim 5.0 K, and both values are lower than the T_{c}\sim 6.0 K of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}.

To further characterize the superconducting properties, we performed resistivity measurements on sample B under constant magnetic fields from 0 to 9 T with sweeping temperature to study the upper critical field H_{c2} (with the field perpendicular to the c axis), and the normalized data for \rho/\rho_{6.8} vs T are shown in Fig. 2(c). With magnetic field increasing, the T_{c} shifts to lower temperatures systematically. We define the \mu_{0}H_{c2} as the field determined by 50% of the normal-state resistivity at T_{c}, and it was depicted as a function of temperature in Fig. 2(d). Considering the Ginzburg-Landau theory, \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T)=\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)(1-t^{2})/(1+t^{2}), here t=T/T_{c}, the zero-temperature upper critical field \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) is estimated to be 20.8 T. This value is much higher than the Pauli paramagnetic limited upper critical field \mu_{0}H_{p}=1.84T_{c}\approx 8.6 T [40], which gives evidence for unconventional superconductivity in KCr_{3}As_{3}, and a similar phenomenon was also reported in Li_{0.9}Mo_{6}O_{17}[41], Sr_{2}RuO_{4}[42], and K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} superconductors [1].

To demonstrate whether the observed superconductivity is the bulk nature of the K-133 phase or from a possible minor remnant K-233 phase which cannot be detected by XRD, the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity were characterized and shown in Fig. 3. Under a magnetic field of 10 Oe (perpendicular to the c axis), samples A and B show a clear diamagnetic superconducting transition at 3.7 and 4.7 K, respectively. Whereas, the shielding volume fraction at 2 K from the ZFC data is only about 9% for sample A, and it is significantly enhanced to nearly 98% for sample B. This is consistent with the behavior of a resistive superconducting transition. The results indicate that sample A only shows very poor superconductivity with a small superconducting fraction, while after annealing, as the crystal lattice is reformed, sample B becomes a good superconductor. For the normal-state susceptibility of sample B, it roughly coincides with the Curie-Weiss behavior with no magnetic ordering transition. In Fig. 3(c) we show the isothermal magnetization curve of sample B with respect to a magnetic field from -5 to 5 T at 2 K, and it reveals typical type-II superconductivity in single-crystalline KCr_{3}As_{3}.

The temperature dependence of heat capacity is plotted in Fig. 3(d) as a relationship for C_{p}/T vs T^{2}. The normal-state data are linearly fitted with both electron and phonon contributions by C_{p}/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2} with T above T_{c}, from which we obtain the Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma as 81.31 mJ/(mol K^{2}), and Debye temperature \theta_{D} as 319 K calculated according to \theta_{D}=[(1/5)\text{N}\pi^{4}/\beta]^{1/3}. Comparing with K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}, the close \gamma values indicate similar strong electron correlations, while the higher \theta_{D} is reasonably originated from the condensed crystal lattice for KCr_{3}As_{3}[1,16]. The clear heat capacity jump in the C_{p} curve happens at about 5 K. This indicates the occurrence of a superconducting transition and further confirms the superconductivity of KCr_{3}As_{3} single crystals, which is consistent with the results of resistivity and magnetization measurements. We note that the value of the heat capacity jump \Delta C_{p}/\gamma T_{c} is about 0.47, which is much smaller than that of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}[1]; this is probably due to the low sample quality by remaining crystal defects which are not fully removed during the annealing process with the relatively low annealing temperature of only 373 K. To further exclude the possibility of a remnant K-233 superconducting phase inside the crystals, the powders of mashed K-133 single crystals were exposed in air for several days and no clear change was observed for the superconducting diamagnetism. This is distinctly different from the K-233 powders which are extremely reactive and burn immediately when exposed in air. The similar superconducting and electronic characteristics in KCr_{3}As_{3} and K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} possibly indicate same electron pairing mechanism that derives from a different lattice symmetry, and the lack of superconductivity in polycrystalline KCr_{3}As_{3} and the annealing effects for single crystals reveal the extreme sensitivity of superconductivity by disorders in the crystal lattice.

In summary, we synthesized the 133-type KCr_{3}As_{3} single crystals, and found superconductivity at a T_{c} of 5.0 K. This compound has a centrosymmetric crystal structure differing from its noncentrosymmetric counterpart K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}. Considering similar superconducting characteristics but different crystal symmetry between the two superconductors, this KCr_{3}As_{3} provides another platform to acquire deep insight into the unconventional superconducting mechanism in these Q1D Cr-based superconductors.
