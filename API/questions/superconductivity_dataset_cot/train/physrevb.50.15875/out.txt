###### Abstract

Measurements of the resistivity, Hall effect, Nernst effect, and thermopower in the normal and in the mixed state of La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 for magnetic fields between 0 and 7 T and temperatures between 20 and 300 K are reported. In the normal state the resistivity shows a linear temperature dependence, while thermopower and Hall effect are only weakly temperature dependent. The Nernst effect in the normal state is about two orders of magnitude smaller than in the mixed state and of opposite sign, with a sign change occurring at about 60 K. Resistivity and thermopower show a strong broadening of the superconducting transition in a magnetic field. The Hall coefficient is positive, i.e., there is no sign change near T_{c} in the mixed state in the whole temperature and magnetic-field range examined.

## I Introduction

The thermomagnetic and galvanomagnetic transport phenomena in the mixed state of the high-temperature superconductors (HTSC's) have attracted considerable interest in the last few years. One of the reasons is that these effects can be studied experimentally in a rather wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields above the irreversibility or melting line, where the pinning of flux lines is weak or absent.

In this paper we present a study of the resistivity, the Hall effect, the Nernst effect, and the thermopower in the mixed state of La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (LSCO). Whereas in YBa2Cu3Ox (YBCO) and in the Bi- and Tl-based HTSC's these effects have been studied in detail (see, e.g., Refs. [1-3] in La-Sr-Cu-O to our knowledge some of these transport properties have not been measured up to now. On the other hand, a study of LSCO can yield important information. It is well known that the transport properties in the mixed state have at least in part to be attributed to the response of normal quasiparticles to the electric field set up by the vortex motion. In YBCO and the Bi- and Tl-based superconductors this response possibly includes that of "normal" subsystems like the CuO chains in YBCO or the BiO layers in the Bi systems. In contrast, such normal subsystems are not present in LSCO and therefore the transport properties in this material have to be attributed entirely to those of the CuO2 planes.

## II Experimental

The preparation of granular bulk samples of La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 as well as a study of the structural and magnetic properties and of the specific heat have been described in detail in Ref. [4]. The sample used in this study shows a sharp resistive transition in zero field (D_Tc_  1.4 K) with zero resistance at T_{c0}=36 K.

Measurements of the Hall effect and the magnetoresistivity as a function of temperature and magnetic field have been carried out using standard experimental techniques described elsewhere.[5, 6]

The Nernst coefficient Q was measured as a function of the magnetic field (swept at about 0.3 T/min) at fixed temperatures stabilized within about 0.1 K with an imposed temperature gradient of about 1.3 K in the mixed state and of about 5-7 K in the normal state. The temperature gradient, built up by a small manganin heater using a constant heating current, was measured with a AuFe-Chromel thermocouple mounted to the ends of the sample. The thermopower S was measured as a function of temperature at constant magnetic fields with a temperature drift of about 0.5-1 K/min.

The thermomagnetic voltages were measured using calibrated Cu wires with an accuracy of about 50 nV. The zero-field voltages for temperatures T < T_{c0} (where the thermopower of LSCO is zero) revealed the thermopower of Cu, _S_Cu, within a few percent. The magnetic-field dependence of _S_Cu was neglected when calculating the absolute thermopower of LSCO [_S_(_B_,_T_) = (D_U_(_B_,_T_)/D_T_) + _S_Cu(_T_)]. For magnetic fields B < 4T this leads only to a minor inaccuracy; however, for B > 4T and for temperatures between 15 and 25 K the error in the absolute magnitude of S is of order 1_mV_/K, as is visible in Fig. 6.

We mention that the sample temperature for the thermomagnetic effects corresponds to the mean value of the temperatures at the hot and cold end of the sample. A more detailed description of the experimental setup is given in Ref. [7].

## III Results and Discussion

### Resistivity

The value of the resistivity at 150 K is 1.6 mO cm, which is in good agreement with Ref. [8] and somewhat larger than reported in Refs. [9] and [10]. The resistivity is linear in temperature between about 50 and 180 K (see inset of Fig. 1). Below 60 K the resistivity decreases faster with decreasing temperature, probably due to superconducting fluctuations.

As commonly observed for the HTSC's the resistive transition broadens strongly in a magnetic field (Fig. 1). We observe a relative broadening of \Delta T_{c}/T_{c} \approx 30-40 % at B = 5 T. Note that the resistivity of a polycrystal reflects the behavior of the in-plane resistivity \rho_{ab} of a single crystal with B perpendicular to the planes (parallel to the c axis). In this configuration the relative broadening \Delta T_{c}/T_{c} of the resistive transition at B = 5 T is about 30-40 % (Ref. [11]) in LSCO single crystals, in good agreement with our results. \Delta T_{c}/T_{c} in LSCO is much larger than in YBCO [\Delta T_{c}/T_{c} \approx 10% at B = 5 T (Ref. [12])] and less than in the BiSrCaCuO (BSCCO) superconductors (\Delta T_{c}/T_{c} \approx 60% at B = 5 T).[1] This reflects the anisotropy of the material: The weaker the coupling between the CuO layers, the larger is the broadening of the transition. While BSCCO has an anisotropy factor of \Gamma = \sqrt{m_{c}/m_{ab}} \approx 50-100, LSCO is less anisotropic with \Gamma \approx 25 - 30.[11] In YBCO \Gamma is of order 7.[13]

We note that an Arrhenius plot of the resistivity yields a thermally activated behavior[14] with activation energies of 360 K at 7 T up to 540 K at 1 T in a temperature range of \Delta T \approx 2.5-3 K in the lowest part of the resistive transition.

### Hall effect

The normal-state Hall coefficient has a value of (2.5-3)\times 10^{-9} m^{3}/C between 40 and 80 K and decreases weakly with increasing temperature. With R_{H} = 1/ne this yields a hole concentration of (2.1-2.5)\times 10^{21} cm^{-3}. This is in good agreement with literature data.[10, 15] The Hall coefficient R_{H} (Fig. 2) is positive and field independent in the normal state well above T_{c}. Below about 30 K, R_{H} vanishes within the limits of our experimental resolution. At low magnetic fields we find a rapid decrease of R_{H} with decreasing temperatures near T_{c}. With increasing magnetic field the transition broadens strongly in a fashion reminiscent of the broadening of the resistive transition.

The qualitative behavior of the tangent of the Hall angle is in agreement with the predictions of the Bardeen

Figure 2: Hall coefficient R_{H} as a function of temperature between 30 and 45 K for various fixed magnetic fields. The symbol \Diamond shows the magnetic-field-independent Hall coefficient. The inset shows the tangent of the Hall angle as function of the magnetic field for various fixed temperatures below T_{c} (see text). The solid lines are guides to the eye.

  Stephen model[16] close to T_{c} (inset of Fig. 2): At the highest temperature shown tanO_{H} varies linearly with the magnetic field. However, at lower temperatures tanO_{H} shows a stronger field dependence.

The Hall coefficient stays positive in the whole temperature and field range. This result has been reproduced on other La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4} samples. We can not exclude the existence of a negative Hall coefficient for magnetic fields B <= 0.5 T, because of the limited resolution of our measurements (D_m__H_ = +-0.4 x 10-9 lnm) and the smallness of the effect for small magnetic fields. However, apparently the Hall coefficient behaves rather differently compared to that of the other HTSC's. There a negative R_{H} exists up to values of the magnetic field of ~5 T or even in higher fields[5, 6, 17-20] and the negative peak of R_{H} close to T_{c} has an absolute value larger than R_{H} in the normal state.

There have been various attempts to explain the sign change of the Hall effect near T_{c} observed in YBCO and the Bi and Tl-based superconductors. One possible way is to describe the Hall effect within a two-band model.[21] Some modifications to the transport equations are suggested by Hagen _et al.[22]_ and Wang and Ting.[23] However, there is no parameter in these models which can be regarded as specific to LSCO, i.e., it is unclear why a sign change of R_{H} should be absent in this system in constrast to the other HTSC's.

Recently it has been proposed that the interaction between drifting thermally excited quasiparticles with the vortices via Andreev reflection gives rise to a drag force on the vortices, which yields a Hall angle opposite in sign to that in the normal state.[24] This extra contribution to R_{H} is of order _k__B__T__c_/4_e__F_. This contribution is therefore smaller in LSCO compared to the other HTSC's, which may explain the absence of a sign change.

Recently it has been found that in the mixed state the Hall resistivity scales with the resistivity according to the law |\rho_{H}|\propto\rho^{\nu}, with n = 2. Luo _et al.[25]_ and Rice _et al.[26]_ find such a scaling of the negative Hall resistivity with the resistivity with n = 1.7 +-0.2 and n = 1.6 +-0.1, respectively. In Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{x} (Bi-2212) the Hall resistivity shows a local, positive maximum at a temperature T_{m} \approx 70 K. Samoilov[27] finds that the positive Hall resistivity for temperatures T < T_{m} scales with the resistivity with n = 2.0 +-0.1. In La-Sr-Cu-O we find a scaling of Hall resistivity and resistivity according to \rho_{H}\propto\rho^{\nu} with n = 1.74 +-0.15 in the whole mixed state (see Fig. 3).

A model explaining this behavior has been proposed by Vinokur _et al.[28]_ They use an equation of motion of the vortices given by

\[\phi_{0}\text{j} \times \mathbf{n} - \alpha \phi_{0}\nu_{\phi} \times \mathbf{n} = \eta \nu_{\phi}\text{ ,}\]

where n, denotes the flux-line velocity, _ph_0 is the flux quantum, e is the viscosity parameter, a is a phenomenological parameter, and **n** is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetic field. Vinokur _et al_. show that pinning leads only to a renormalization of the viscosity parameter e and that the Hall resistivity is given by

\[\rho_{H} = \frac{\alpha}{\phi_{0}B}\rho^{2}\text{ .}\]

A possible deviation from the exponent n = 2 may be due to the temperature dependence of a.

### Nernst effect

The normal state Nernst coefficient of LSCO is of order (-0.2 to -0.8) x 10-8 V/K T +-0.4 x 10-8 V/K T between 70 to 200 K (inset of Fig. 4). This order of magnitude is typical for what is observed in conventional metals (Table I).[29]

The most prominent feature in the inset of Fig. 4 is the sign change of Q well above T_{c} followed by a strong increase with decreasing temperature. This is most probably related to the onset of superconducting fluctuations.[30] Thus the measurement of the Nernst effect is a promising tool for the study of superconducting fluctuations above T_{c}, since the fluctuation contribution exceeds the normal contribution by far. Nevertheless, for a comparison of the data to theoretical predictions it is neces

  sary to extend the measurements to higher magnetic fields, which due to the larger Nernst voltage allows for smaller imposed temperature gradients and thus for a better temperature resolution.

The Nernst effect in the mixed state arises from the motion of vortices in response to the thermal force (per unit length)

\[{\bf f}_{\rm th} = - S_{\phi}{\bf\nabla}T\ .\] (3)

This force arises, since a vortex transports an entropy S_{\phi} (per unit length). We mention that the Nernst coefficient in the mixed state of a superconductor should always be positive, since vortices carry an excess entropy compared to the superconducting surrounding and therefore always move from the hot to the cold end of the sample, thereby "inducing" the Nernst voltage. Thus the sign of the Nernst coefficient in the mixed state is independent of the sign of the charge carriers and accordingly Q must change its sign with the onset of superconductivity in any material with a negative normal-state Nernst coefficient. An overview of the theories concerning the normal-state Nernst effect can be found, e.g., in Ref. [31].

Figure 4 shows the product QB of the Nernst coefficient Q with the magnetic field as a function of temperature at fixed magnetic fields. In the superconducting state with decreasing temperature the Nernst coefficient rapidly increases and reaches a maximum at temperatures rather close to T_{c0}. At the maximum QB is of the order of 1 \muV/K at 6 T. A second maximum is seen at somewhat lower temperatures. We mention that--looking apart from the double maximum--these results are comparable to what is found for the Nernst effect of other HTSC's [32, 33].

Figure 5 shows the transport entropy versus temperature for some fixed magnetic fields derived from the Nernst effect and the magnetoresistivity [34]

\[\frac{S_{\phi}}{\phi_{0}} = \frac{QB}{\rho_{f}}\ .\] (4)

Here \phi_{0} is the flux quantum and \rho_{f} is the resistivity in the mixed state under the assumption that it is completely due to vortex motion. The maximum value is S_{\phi} \approx (2 - 3) \times 10^{- 15} J/K m, comparable to values of the transport entropy usually found for the HTSC's (see Table II).

The transport entropy is often compared to the result of Maki [35] derived from the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory (TDGL):

\[S_{\phi} = - \frac{\phi_{0}}{T}(M)L(T)\] (5) \[= \frac{\phi_{0}}{1.16(2\kappa^{2} - 1) + 1}\times\frac{L(T)}{T}\times\frac{B_{c2}(T) - B}{\mu_{0}}\ .\]

Here \kappa denotes the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, \langle M\rangle is the space-averaged magnetization, and L(T) is a function with 0 \leq L(T) \leq 1, which is only weakly temperature dependent in the dirty limit and close to L \approx 1 at T \lesssim T_{c}. In the clean-limit L \propto l/\xi with L = l/\xi at T = T_{c}. Using \kappa \approx 100 and a value for the upper critical field B_{c2}(0) = 50 T, for a magnetic field of B = 3 T and L(T) \approx 1, one finds for La-Sr-Cu-O

\[S_{\phi}(0.95\times T_{c}) \approx 3 \times 10^{- 15}\ {\rm J/K\ m}\ .\] (6)

Figure 4: Nernst coefficient QB as a function of temperature between 26 and 42 K for various fixed magnetic fields: \ast : 6 T; \times 3 T; \circ: 1 T. The Nernst coefficient shows a maximum near T_{c0} \approx 36 K. The solid lines are guides to the eye. The inset shows the Nernst coefficient Q as a function of temperature between 40 and 200 K. The normal-state Nernst coefficient is negative and of the order of several 10^{- 9} V/K T. It shows a sign change and a rapid increase below about 60 K with decreasing temperature to positive values probably due to the onset of superconducting fluctuations. The solid line is a guide to the eye.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c}  & Q & T \\  & [10^{- 8}\ {\rm V/K\ T}] & [{\rm K}] \\ \hline Ag & -1.8 - 4.3 & \approx 320 \\ Au & -1.81 & 298- 330 \\ Cu & -2.1 & 298- 328 \\ Tl & -0.37 & 333 \\ Ir & -0.05 & 323 \\ Al & +0.2 & 328 \\ In & +0.32 & 333 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Nernst coefficient Q of several metals (from Ref. [29]).

  This is in good agreement with the experimental value.

Let us compare the result of Eq. (5) with that obtained from a much simpler model, in which it is assumed that in the mixed state of a superconductor only the normal cores of the vortices carry entropy and that this entropy per unit volume is equal to the electronic entropy per unit volume of the normal metal. With this one finds for the entropy S_{m} of a superconductor in the mixed state [36]

\[S_{m} = \gamma T\frac{B}{B_{c2}(T)} \propto \frac{\xi(T)^{2}}{d^{2}}\ .\]

Here d = \sqrt{\phi_{0}/B} denotes the distance between vortices and \gamma T is the entropy per volume of the normal metal. [The electronic specific heat is given as c_{v} = \gamma T. The entropy S per volume is related to the specific heat via the relation c_{v} = T(dS/dT).]

The entropy (per unit length) of _one_ vortex is then given by

\[S_{\phi} = \frac{S_{m}}{n} = \gamma T\frac{\phi_{0}}{B_{c2}(T)}\ ,\]

where n = B/\phi_{0} is the vortex density.

Equation (8) is at first glance not very similar to the Maki result. Nevertheless, with some results from BCS and Ginzburg-Landau theory, (\nu/2\mu_{0})B_{c\rm th}(0)^{2} = \frac{1}{4}N(\epsilon_{F})\Delta(0)^{2}, \Delta(0) = 1.764k_{B}T_{c}, B_{c2}(0) = \sqrt{2}\kappa B_{c\rm th}(0),B_{c2}(T) \approx B_{c2}(0)(1 - T^{2}/T_{c}^{2}) and using the free-electron-gas value \gamma = (\pi^{2}/3)N(\epsilon_{F})k_{B}^{2}, where N(\epsilon_{F}) denotes the density of states at the Fermi energy and \Delta(0) the energy gap at T = 0, one obtains

\[S_{\phi} \simeq \frac{\phi_{0}}{\kappa^{2}} \times \frac{TT_{c}^{2}}{(T_{c}^{2} - T^{2})^{2}} \times \frac{B_{c2}(T)}{\mu_{0}}\ .\]

Let us now calculate the transport entropy for an extreme type-II superconductor with \kappa > > 1 for magnetic fields not too close to B_{c2} and temperatures not too close to T_{c}, e.g., at T = T_{c}/2:

\[S_{\phi}(T_{c}/2) = 0.89 \times \frac{1}{T_{c}} \times \frac{\phi_{0}}{\kappa^{2}} \times \frac{B_{c2}(T_{c}/2)}{\mu_{0}}\ ,\]

\[S_{\phi}(T_{c}/2)^{(\rm Maki)} \simeq 0.6 \times \frac{1}

  \[\frac{S_{\phi}^{\rm HTSC}}{S_{\phi}^{\rm conv.\,SC}}=\frac{(\gamma T\xi^{2})^{\rm HTSC }}{(\gamma T\xi^{2})^{\rm conv.\,SC}}\approx 10^{-3}\ .\] (12)

The transport entropy in HTSC's should be about three orders of magnitude smaller than in conventional superconductors, mainly due to the much smaller coherence length. For conventional superconductors the transport entropy has maximum values of the order of 10^{-12}-10^{-11} J/K m. [50, 51] Therefore one expects for the HTSC values of 10^{-15}-10^{-14} J/K m, in good agreement with experimental results.

### Thermopower

The absolute value of the thermopower of La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4} is somewhat controversial in the literature. It ranges from room-temperature values of about 15 \muV/K (Ref. [52]) up to about 55 \muV/K, [53] which is possibly due to the strong sensitivity of the thermopower with respect to the strontium (and oxygen) content. [54] We find a room-temperature value of the thermopower of S\approx 18\muV/K, which is at the lower end of the values reported. Between room temperature and 150 K the thermopower increases from about 18 to \approx21 \muV/K with decreasing temperature. This weak temperature dependence of S is in fairly good agreement with what is reported in the literature. [52, 54] Below 150 K it decreases again to a value of 15 \muV/K just above T_{c}.

The thermopower S shows a sharp superconducting transition at T_{c} in zero field. In the superconducting state for B=0 the absolute thermopower of LSCO vanishes. For finite magnetic fields the behavior of S is rather similar to that of the resistivity (Figs. 1 and 6). We mention again that the negative values of S seen in Fig. 6 are due to the magnetic-field dependence of the thermopower of the copper leads, which is strong (of order 1 \muV/K) at 5 T between 15 and 40 K. [55]

We emphasize that the thermopower in the mixed state is of order 10 \muV/K. This is larger than the absolute magnitude of the Nernst voltage, i.e., we find QB<S. According to the conventional theories of flux motion the flux-flow contribution to the thermopower depends on the Hall angle, i.e., flux lines move at the Hall angle with respect to the thermal force {\bf f}_{\rm th}. Therefore this contribution to S is by far smaller than the Nernst effect: The Hall angle tan\alpha=\rho_{H}/\rho as extracted from the resistivity and the Hall voltage is of order of a few degree, which yields (S/QB)\approx 10^{-3}.

It is well accepted that the large thermopower found in the mixed state of the HTSC's has to be attributed to the dynamics of quasiparticles. A detailed discussion has been given in several publications, to which we refer the reader. [1, 32, 45, 56, 57] We point out here that the occurrence of the thermopower in LSCO excludes the possibility that normal subsystems like the CuO chains in YBCO or the BiO layers in the Bi-based systems are responsible for the longitudinal quasiparticle heat current, which determines the thermopower. In LSCO such normal subsystems are not present, yet the broadening of the thermopower is very similar to that observed in other HTSC's.

## IV Conclusions

We have reported measurements of resistivity, thermopower, Hall effect, and Nernst effect in the mixed and in the normal state of La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4}. Resistivity and thermopower show a strong broadening of the transition to superconductivity in a magnetic field, similar to what is observed in other HTSC's. The Hall coefficient shows no sign change near T_{c} for 5 T > B > 0.5 T. The Nernst effect in the normal state is two orders of magnitude smaller than in the mixed state and negative. It shows large superconducting fluctuations above T_{c}. The transport entropy, due to the normal excitations in the vortex cores, is in agreement with calculations from TDGL.

###### Abstract

Measurements of the resistivity, Hall effect, Nernst effect, and thermopower in the normal and in the mixed state of La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 for magnetic fields between 0 and 7 T and temperatures between 20 and 300 K are reported. In the normal state the resistivity shows a linear temperature dependence, while thermopower and Hall effect are only weakly temperature dependent. The Nernst effect in the normal state is about two orders of magnitude smaller than in the mixed state and of opposite sign, with a sign change occurring at about 60 K. Resistivity and thermopower show a strong broadening of the superconducting transition in a magnetic field. The Hall coefficient is positive, i.e., there is no sign change near T_{c} in the mixed state in the whole temperature and magnetic-field range examined.

## I Introduction

The thermomagnetic and galvanomagnetic transport phenomena in the mixed state of the high-temperature superconductors (HTSC's) have attracted considerable interest in the last few years. One of the reasons is that these effects can be studied experimentally in a rather wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields above the irreversibility or melting line, where the pinning of flux lines is weak or absent.

In this paper we present a study of the resistivity, the Hall effect, the Nernst effect, and the thermopower in the mixed state of La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (LSCO). Whereas in YBa2Cu3Ox (YBCO) and in the Bi- and Tl-based HTSC's these effects have been studied in detail (see, e.g., Refs. [1-3] in La-Sr-Cu-O to our knowledge some of these transport properties have not been measured up to now. On the other hand, a study of LSCO can yield important information. It is well known that the transport properties in the mixed state have at least in part to be attributed to the response of normal quasiparticles to the electric field set up by the vortex motion. In YBCO and the Bi- and Tl-based superconductors this response possibly includes that of "normal" subsystems like the CuO chains in YBCO or the BiO layers in the Bi systems. In contrast, such normal subsystems are not present in LSCO and therefore the transport properties in this material have to be attributed entirely to those of the CuO2 planes.

## II Experimental

The preparation of granular bulk samples of La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 as well as a study of the structural and magnetic properties and of the specific heat have been described in detail in Ref. [4]. The sample used in this study shows a sharp resistive transition in zero field (D_Tc_  1.4 K) with zero resistance at T_{c0}=36 K.

Measurements of the Hall effect and the magnetoresistivity as a function of temperature and magnetic field have been carried out using standard experimental techniques described elsewhere.[5, 6]

The Nernst coefficient Q was measured as a function of the magnetic field (swept at about 0.3 T/min) at fixed temperatures stabilized within about 0.1 K with an imposed temperature gradient of about 1.3 K in the mixed state and of about 5-7 K in the normal state. The temperature gradient, built up by a small manganin heater using a constant heating current, was measured with a AuFe-Chromel thermocouple mounted to the ends of the sample. The thermopower S was measured as a function of temperature at constant magnetic fields with a temperature drift of about 0.5-1 K/min.

The thermomagnetic voltages were measured using calibrated Cu wires with an accuracy of about 50 nV. The zero-field voltages for temperatures T < T_{c0} (where the thermopower of LSCO is zero) revealed the thermopower of Cu, _S_Cu, within a few percent. The magnetic-field dependence of _S_Cu was neglected when calculating the absolute thermopower of LSCO [_S_(_B_,_T_) = (D_U_(_B_,_T_)/D_T_) + _S_Cu(_T_)]. For magnetic fields B < 4T this leads only to a minor inaccuracy; however, for B > 4T and for temperatures between 15 and 25 K the error in the absolute magnitude of S is of order 1_mV_/K, as is visible in Fig. 6.

We mention that the sample temperature for the thermomagnetic effects corresponds to the mean value of the temperatures at the hot and cold end of the sample. A more detailed description of the experimental setup is given in Ref. [7].

## III Results and Discussion

### Resistivity

The value of the resistivity at 150 K is 1.6 mO cm, which is in good agreement with Ref. [8] and somewhat larger than reported in Refs. [9] and [10]. The resistivity is linear in temperature between about 50 and 180 K (see inset of Fig. 1). Below 60 K the resistivity decreases faster with decreasing temperature, probably due to superconducting fluctuations.

As commonly observed for the HTSC's the resistive transition broadens strongly in a magnetic field (Fig. 1). We observe a relative broadening of \Delta T_{c}/T_{c} \approx 30-40 % at B = 5 T. Note that the resistivity of a polycrystal reflects the behavior of the in-plane resistivity \rho_{ab} of a single crystal with B perpendicular to the planes (parallel to the c axis). In this configuration the relative broadening \Delta T_{c}/T_{c} of the resistive transition at B = 5 T is about 30-40 % (Ref. [11]) in LSCO single crystals, in good agreement with our results. \Delta T_{c}/T_{c} in LSCO is much larger than in YBCO [\Delta T_{c}/T_{c} \approx 10% at B = 5 T (Ref. [12])] and less than in the BiSrCaCuO (BSCCO) superconductors (\Delta T_{c}/T_{c} \approx 60% at B = 5 T).[1] This reflects the anisotropy of the material: The weaker the coupling between the CuO layers, the larger is the broadening of the transition. While BSCCO has an anisotropy factor of \Gamma = \sqrt{m_{c}/m_{ab}} \approx 50-100, LSCO is less anisotropic with \Gamma \approx 25 - 30.[11] In YBCO \Gamma is of order 7.[13]

We note that an Arrhenius plot of the resistivity yields a thermally activated behavior[14] with activation energies of 360 K at 7 T up to 540 K at 1 T in a temperature range of \Delta T \approx 2.5-3 K in the lowest part of the resistive transition.

### Hall effect

The normal-state Hall coefficient has a value of (2.5-3)\times 10^{-9} m^{3}/C between 40 and 80 K and decreases weakly with increasing temperature. With R_{H} = 1/ne this yields a hole concentration of (2.1-2.5)\times 10^{21} cm^{-3}. This is in good agreement with literature data.[10, 15] The Hall coefficient R_{H} (Fig. 2) is positive and field independent in the normal state well above T_{c}. Below about 30 K, R_{H} vanishes within the limits of our experimental resolution. At low magnetic fields we find a rapid decrease of R_{H} with decreasing temperatures near T_{c}. With increasing magnetic field the transition broadens strongly in a fashion reminiscent of the broadening of the resistive transition.

The qualitative behavior of the tangent of the Hall angle is in agreement with the predictions of the Bardeen

Figure 1: Resistivity \rho as a function of temperature between 20 and 50 K for various fixed magnetic fields B = 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 T (from right to left). The inset shows the resistivity at B = 0 T.

Figure 2: Hall coefficient R_{H} as a function of temperature between 30 and 45 K for various fixed magnetic fields. The symbol \Diamond shows the magnetic-field-independent Hall coefficient. The inset shows the tangent of the Hall angle as function of the magnetic field for various fixed temperatures below T_{c} (see text). The solid lines are guides to the eye.

  Stephen model[16] close to T_{c} (inset of Fig. 2): At the highest temperature shown tanO_{H} varies linearly with the magnetic field. However, at lower temperatures tanO_{H} shows a stronger field dependence.

The Hall coefficient stays positive in the whole temperature and field range. This result has been reproduced on other La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4} samples. We can not exclude the existence of a negative Hall coefficient for magnetic fields B <= 0.5 T, because of the limited resolution of our measurements (D_m__H_ = +-0.4 x 10-9 lnm) and the smallness of the effect for small magnetic fields. However, apparently the Hall coefficient behaves rather differently compared to that of the other HTSC's. There a negative R_{H} exists up to values of the magnetic field of ~5 T or even in higher fields[5, 6, 17-20] and the negative peak of R_{H} close to T_{c} has an absolute value larger than R_{H} in the normal state.

There have been various attempts to explain the sign change of the Hall effect near T_{c} observed in YBCO and the Bi and Tl-based superconductors. One possible way is to describe the Hall effect within a two-band model.[21] Some modifications to the transport equations are suggested by Hagen _et al.[22]_ and Wang and Ting.[23] However, there is no parameter in these models which can be regarded as specific to LSCO, i.e., it is unclear why a sign change of R_{H} should be absent in this system in constrast to the other HTSC's.

Recently it has been proposed that the interaction between drifting thermally excited quasiparticles with the vortices via Andreev reflection gives rise to a drag force on the vortices, which yields a Hall angle opposite in sign to that in the normal state.[24] This extra contribution to R_{H} is of order _k__B__T__c_/4_e__F_. This contribution is therefore smaller in LSCO compared to the other HTSC's, which may explain the absence of a sign change.

Recently it has been found that in the mixed state the Hall resistivity scales with the resistivity according to the law |\rho_{H}|\propto\rho^{\nu}, with n = 2. Luo _et al.[25]_ and Rice _et al.[26]_ find such a scaling of the negative Hall resistivity with the resistivity with n = 1.7 +-0.2 and n = 1.6 +-0.1, respectively. In Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{x} (Bi-2212) the Hall resistivity shows a local, positive maximum at a temperature T_{m} \approx 70 K. Samoilov[27] finds that the positive Hall resistivity for temperatures T < T_{m} scales with the resistivity with n = 2.0 +-0.1. In La-Sr-Cu-O we find a scaling of Hall resistivity and resistivity according to \rho_{H}\propto\rho^{\nu} with n = 1.74 +-0.15 in the whole mixed state (see Fig. 3).

A model explaining this behavior has been proposed by Vinokur _et al.[28]_ They use an equation of motion of the vortices given by

\[\phi_{0}\text{j} \times \mathbf{n} - \alpha \phi_{0}\nu_{\phi} \times \mathbf{n} = \eta \nu_{\phi}\text{ ,}\]

where n, denotes the flux-line velocity, _ph_0 is the flux quantum, e is the viscosity parameter, a is a phenomenological parameter, and **n** is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetic field. Vinokur _et al_. show that pinning leads only to a renormalization of the viscosity parameter e and that the Hall resistivity is given by

\[\rho_{H} = \frac{\alpha}{\phi_{0}B}\rho^{2}\text{ .}\]

A possible deviation from the exponent n = 2 may be due to the temperature dependence of a.

### Nernst effect

The normal state Nernst coefficient of LSCO is of order (-0.2 to -0.8) x 10-8 V/K T +-0.4 x 10-8 V/K T between 70 to 200 K (inset of Fig. 4). This order of magnitude is typical for what is observed in conventional metals (Table I).[29]

The most prominent feature in the inset of Fig. 4 is the sign change of Q well above T_{c} followed by a strong increase with decreasing temperature. This is most probably related to the onset of superconducting fluctuations.[30] Thus the measurement of the Nernst effect is a promising tool for the study of superconducting fluctuations above T_{c}, since the fluctuation contribution exceeds the normal contribution by far. Nevertheless, for a comparison of the data to theoretical predictions it is neces

Figure 3: Scaling of Hall resistivity _ρH_ and resistivity _ρ_ of La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4} for several magnetic fields (_B_ = 1, 2, 3, and 4 T) in a double-logarithmic plot. The straight line is a fit to the data according to \rho_{H}\propto\rho^{\nu} with n = 1.74 +-0.15 (see text).

  sary to extend the measurements to higher magnetic fields, which due to the larger Nernst voltage allows for smaller imposed temperature gradients and thus for a better temperature resolution.

The Nernst effect in the mixed state arises from the motion of vortices in response to the thermal force (per unit length)

\[{\bf f}_{\rm th} = - S_{\phi}{\bf\nabla}T\ .\] (3)

This force arises, since a vortex transports an entropy S_{\phi} (per unit length). We mention that the Nernst coefficient in the mixed state of a superconductor should always be positive, since vortices carry an excess entropy compared to the superconducting surrounding and therefore always move from the hot to the cold end of the sample, thereby "inducing" the Nernst voltage. Thus the sign of the Nernst coefficient in the mixed state is independent of the sign of the charge carriers and accordingly Q must change its sign with the onset of superconductivity in any material with a negative normal-state Nernst coefficient. An overview of the theories concerning the normal-state Nernst effect can be found, e.g., in Ref. [31].

Figure 4 shows the product QB of the Nernst coefficient Q with the magnetic field as a function of temperature at fixed magnetic fields. In the superconducting state with decreasing temperature the Nernst coefficient rapidly increases and reaches a maximum at temperatures rather close to T_{c0}. At the maximum QB is of the order of 1 \muV/K at 6 T. A second maximum is seen at somewhat lower temperatures. We mention that--looking apart from the double maximum--these results are comparable to what is found for the Nernst effect of other HTSC's [32, 33].

Figure 5 shows the transport entropy versus temperature for some fixed magnetic fields derived from the Nernst effect and the magnetoresistivity [34]

\[\frac{S_{\phi}}{\phi_{0}} = \frac{QB}{\rho_{f}}\ .\] (4)

Here \phi_{0} is the flux quantum and \rho_{f} is the resistivity in the mixed state under the assumption that it is completely due to vortex motion. The maximum value is S_{\phi} \approx (2 - 3) \times 10^{- 15} J/K m, comparable to values of the transport entropy usually found for the HTSC's (see Table II).

The transport entropy is often compared to the result of Maki [35] derived from the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory (TDGL):

\[S_{\phi} = - \frac{\phi_{0}}{T}(M)L(T)\] (5) \[= \frac{\phi_{0}}{1.16(2\kappa^{2} - 1) + 1}\times\frac{L(T)}{T}\times\frac{B_{c2}(T) - B}{\mu_{0}}\ .\]

Here \kappa denotes the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, \langle M\rangle is the space-averaged magnetization, and L(T) is a function with 0 \leq L(T) \leq 1, which is only weakly temperature dependent in the dirty limit and close to L \approx 1 at T \lesssim T_{c}. In the clean-limit L \propto l/\xi with L = l/\xi at T = T_{c}. Using \kappa \approx 100 and a value for the upper critical field B_{c2}(0) = 50 T, for a magnetic field of B = 3 T and L(T) \approx 1, one finds for La-Sr-Cu-O

\[S_{\phi}(0.95\times T_{c}) \approx 3 \times 10^{- 15}\ {\rm J/K\ m}\ .\] (6)

Figure 4: Nernst coefficient QB as a function of temperature between 26 and 42 K for various fixed magnetic fields: \ast : 6 T; \times 3 T; \circ: 1 T. The Nernst coefficient shows a maximum near T_{c0} \approx 36 K. The solid lines are guides to the eye. The inset shows the Nernst coefficient Q as a function of temperature between 40 and 200 K. The normal-state Nernst coefficient is negative and of the order of several 10^{- 9} V/K T. It shows a sign change and a rapid increase below about 60 K with decreasing temperature to positive values probably due to the onset of superconducting fluctuations. The solid line is a guide to the eye.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c}  & Q & T \\  & [10^{- 8}\ {\rm V/K\ T}] & [{\rm K}] \\ \hline Ag & -1.8 - 4.3 & \approx 320 \\ Au & -1.81 & 298- 330 \\ Cu & -2.1 & 298- 328 \\ Tl & -0.37 & 333 \\ Ir & -0.05 & 323 \\ Al & +0.2 & 328 \\ In & +0.32 & 333 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Nernst coefficient Q of several metals (from Ref. [29]).

  This is in good agreement with the experimental value.

Let us compare the result of Eq. (5) with that obtained from a much simpler model, in which it is assumed that in the mixed state of a superconductor only the normal cores of the vortices carry entropy and that this entropy per unit volume is equal to the electronic entropy per unit volume of the normal metal. With this one finds for the entropy S_{m} of a superconductor in the mixed state [36]

\[S_{m} = \gamma T\frac{B}{B_{c2}(T)} \propto \frac{\xi(T)^{2}}{d^{2}}\ .\]

Here d = \sqrt{\phi_{0}/B} denotes the distance between vortices and \gamma T is the entropy per volume of the normal metal. [The electronic specific heat is given as c_{v} = \gamma T. The entropy S per volume is related to the specific heat via the relation c_{v} = T(dS/dT).]

The entropy (per unit length) of _one_ vortex is then given by

\[S_{\phi} = \frac{S_{m}}{n} = \gamma T\frac{\phi_{0}}{B_{c2}(T)}\ ,\]

where n = B/\phi_{0} is the vortex density.

Equation (8) is at first glance not very similar to the Maki result. Nevertheless, with some results from BCS and Ginzburg-Landau theory, (\nu/2\mu_{0})B_{c\rm th}(0)^{2} = \frac{1}{4}N(\epsilon_{F})\Delta(0)^{2}, \Delta(0) = 1.764k_{B}T_{c}, B_{c2}(0) = \sqrt{2}\kappa B_{c\rm th}(0),B_{c2}(T) \approx B_{c2}(0)(1 - T^{2}/T_{c}^{2}) and using the free-electron-gas value \gamma = (\pi^{2}/3)N(\epsilon_{F})k_{B}^{2}, where N(\epsilon_{F}) denotes the density of states at the Fermi energy and \Delta(0) the energy gap at T = 0, one obtains

\[S_{\phi} \simeq \frac{\phi_{0}}{\kappa^{2}} \times \frac{TT_{c}^{2}}{(T_{c}^{2} - T^{2})^{2}} \times \frac{B_{c2}(T)}{\mu_{0}}\ .\]

Let us now calculate the transport entropy for an extreme type-II superconductor with \kappa > > 1 for magnetic fields not too close to B_{c2} and temperatures not too close to T_{c}, e.g., at T = T_{c}/2:

\[S_{\phi}(T_{c}/2) = 0.89 \times \frac{1}{T_{c}} \times \frac{\phi_{0}}{\kappa^{2}} \times \frac{B_{c2}(T_{c}/2)}{\mu_{0}}\ ,\]

\[S_{\phi}(T_{c}/2)^{(\rm Maki)} \simeq 0.6 \times \frac{1}

  \[\frac{S_{\phi}^{\rm HTSC}}{S_{\phi}^{\rm conv.\,SC}}=\frac{(\gamma T\xi^{2})^{\rm HTSC }}{(\gamma T\xi^{2})^{\rm conv.\,SC}}\approx 10^{-3}\ .\] (12)

The transport entropy in HTSC's should be about three orders of magnitude smaller than in conventional superconductors, mainly due to the much smaller coherence length. For conventional superconductors the transport entropy has maximum values of the order of 10^{-12}-10^{-11} J/K m. [50, 51] Therefore one expects for the HTSC values of 10^{-15}-10^{-14} J/K m, in good agreement with experimental results.

### Thermopower

The absolute value of the thermopower of La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4} is somewhat controversial in the literature. It ranges from room-temperature values of about 15 \muV/K (Ref. [52]) up to about 55 \muV/K, [53] which is possibly due to the strong sensitivity of the thermopower with respect to the strontium (and oxygen) content. [54] We find a room-temperature value of the thermopower of S\approx 18\muV/K, which is at the lower end of the values reported. Between room temperature and 150 K the thermopower increases from about 18 to \approx21 \muV/K with decreasing temperature. This weak temperature dependence of S is in fairly good agreement with what is reported in the literature. [52, 54] Below 150 K it decreases again to a value of 15 \muV/K just above T_{c}.

The thermopower S shows a sharp superconducting transition at T_{c} in zero field. In the superconducting state for B=0 the absolute thermopower of LSCO vanishes. For finite magnetic fields the behavior of S is rather similar to that of the resistivity (Figs. 1 and 6). We mention again that the negative values of S seen in Fig. 6 are due to the magnetic-field dependence of the thermopower of the copper leads, which is strong (of order 1 \muV/K) at 5 T between 15 and 40 K. [55]

We emphasize that the thermopower in the mixed state is of order 10 \muV/K. This is larger than the absolute magnitude of the Nernst voltage, i.e., we find QB<S. According to the conventional theories of flux motion the flux-flow contribution to the thermopower depends on the Hall angle, i.e., flux lines move at the Hall angle with respect to the thermal force {\bf f}_{\rm th}. Therefore this contribution to S is by far smaller than the Nernst effect: The Hall angle tan\alpha=\rho_{H}/\rho as extracted from the resistivity and the Hall voltage is of order of a few degree, which yields (S/QB)\approx 10^{-3}.

It is well accepted that the large thermopower found in the mixed state of the HTSC's has to be attributed to the dynamics of quasiparticles. A detailed discussion has been given in several publications, to which we refer the reader. [1, 32, 45, 56, 57] We point out here that the occurrence of the thermopower in LSCO excludes the possibility that normal subsystems like the CuO chains in YBCO or the BiO layers in the Bi-based systems are responsible for the longitudinal quasiparticle heat current, which determines the thermopower. In LSCO such normal subsystems are not present, yet the broadening of the thermopower is very similar to that observed in other HTSC's.

## IV Conclusions

We have reported measurements of resistivity, thermopower, Hall effect, and Nernst effect in the mixed and in the normal state of La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4}. Resistivity and thermopower show a strong broadening of the transition to superconductivity in a magnetic field, similar to what is observed in other HTSC's. The Hall coefficient shows no sign change near T_{c} for 5 T > B > 0.5 T. The Nernst effect in the normal state is two orders of magnitude smaller than in the mixed state and negative. It shows large superconducting fluctuations above T_{c}. The transport entropy, due to the normal excitations in the vortex cores, is in agreement with calculations from TDGL.
