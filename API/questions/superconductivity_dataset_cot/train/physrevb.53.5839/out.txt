###### Abstract

We report detailed studies of the normal-state resistivity and the Hall-effect in bulk R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} samples (R = Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, and Nd). We find a linear temperature dependence of the normal-state resistivity \rho_{u} and the Hall number n_{H} above T_{c} in these systems. At a constant temperature both \rho_{u} and n_{H} are linearly dependent on the ion-size of the rare earth, viz., the larger R^{3+} ionic radius, the larger \rho_{u}, but the lower n_{H}. The cotangent of the Hall angle follows a universal T^{2} dependence, i.e., \cot\theta_{H} = \alpha T^{2}+C. Both the slope \alpha and the quantity C is insensitive to the R ion and remains almost constant. On the basis of our data we propose a T_{c}-n_{H} diagram which manifests an "undergoping" behavior of R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} systems. We suggest that the strong hybridization between the 4f states of the Pr ion and the conduction-band states in CuO_{2} planes, leading to hole localization and pair breaking, are the mechanism for the suppression of superconductivity in R_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} systems.

## I Introduction

PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is an intriguing exception among the rare-earth substituted isomorphic YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} compounds due to the absence of superconductivity as well as a metallic state.[1] Specific heat and magnetization measurements[2] on PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} showed an anomalous magnetic ordering at T_{N}=17 K. Neutron diffraction[3] experiment suggested that this ordering is a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order in the Pr sublattice. One approach in understanding these striking properties of PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is to study in detail the effect of Pr doping in RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} compounds.[1]

The attractiveness of these systems is that the continuous composition range, 0<=x<=1, of solid solution formed in the R_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} systems based on different R provides a unique possibility to study the superconducting and magnetic subsystem interference.[1]

We have carried out systematic study of the effect by Pr doping in R_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} systems (R =Lu, Yb, Tm, Er, Y, Ho, Dy, Gd, Eu, Sm, and Nd).[4; 5; 6] It is found that at a critical Pr concentration, _x__{\rm cr}, the superconductivity is completely quenched, beyond which the system becomes insulating and displays magnetic ordering of the Pr sublattice. We observed a rare-earth ion size effect on T_{c}, T_{N}, and _x__{\rm cr} in these systems.

In Pr concentration region of _x_<_x__{\rm cr}, the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} decreases linearly with increasing Pr concentration, and that at a given Pr concentration, T_{c} decreases linearly with increasing the radius of R ion.[4]

On the other hand, in Pr concentration region of _x_>_x__{\rm cr}, the magnetic ordering temperature T_{N} of the Pr ions decreases linearly with increasing R concentration. At a given R concentration, T_{N} decreases linearly with decreasing the radius of R ion.[5]

We observed that the critical Pr concentration _x__{\rm cr} also decreases linearly with increasing the radius of R ion.[4] The observed results were interpreted in terms of the hybridization between the local states of Pr ion and the valence band states of the CuO_{2} planes.[6]

One of the most puzzling problems in the study of high-T_{c} superconductors has been the anomalous linear temperature dependence of their normal-state resistivity \rho_{u} and the Hall number n_{H} above T_{c},[7] which is inconsistent with an isotropic single-band Fermi-liquid description. A theory in the framework of the two-dimensional Luttinger liquid was proposed by Anderson,[8] who argues that the intrinsic electronic freedom in CuO_{2} planes is decomposed into two types of quasiparticle excitations, spin-\frac{1}{2} chargeless spinons and charged spinless holons. The relaxation times for carrier motion normal to the Fermi surface and parallel to it are differentiated. The predicted T^{2}-dependence of the Hall angle has been observed in many high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors.[9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14]

Extensive studies of the Hall effect have been carried out on the following 123-systems: (1) YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} with changing the oxygen content \delta,[9; 10] (2) Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} with changing the Pr content x;[11] and (3) YBa_{2}Cu_{3-x}M_{x}O_{7-\delta} with changing the transition metal content x.[12; 13; 14]

All of the Hall experiments above[9; 10; 11] have focused on the change of the concentration x of the dopants (Zn, Co, Fe, Pr) or the oxygen reduction x. In modification of our previous  observation that the R^{3+} ion size has a very strong effect on superconducting and magnetic properties in R_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y}[4, 5, 6] we carried out present Hall measurements in R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}Pr_{7-y} systems, in which instead of changing the concentration, we change the R^{3+} ion while leaving the concentration of Pr and oxygen unchanged.

In this paper we report detailed studies of the normal state resistivity and Hall effect of bulk (R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (R =Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, and Nd). We find a linear temperature dependence of the resistivity \rho_{n} and the Hall number n_{H} above T_{c} in these systems. The cotangent of the Hall angle follows a universal T^{2} dependence, namely, cot \theta=\,\alpha T^{2}+C. Both the slope \alpha and the quantity C remain almost constant and are insensitive to the change of R ion in R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y}. We find a rare-earth ion size effect on resistivity \rho_{n} and the Hall number n_{H}. At a constant temperature the resistivity \rho_{n} and the Hall number n_{H} is linearly dependent on R^{3+} ionic radius, the larger R^{3+} ionic radius, the larger \rho_{n} , but the lower n_{H}. Based on our data we proposed a T_{c}-n_{H} diagram which manifests an underdopinglike behavior of R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (R =Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, and Nd) systems.

## II Experimental

The ceramic R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (R =Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, and Nd) samples were synthesized using a conventional solid state reaction method. Stoichiometric amounts of high purity R_{2}O_{3} (R =Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, and Nd), Pr_{6}O_{11}, BaCo_{3} and CuO powders were mixed, ground and calcined at 915 degC for about 24 h in air in Al_{2}O_{3} crucibles, followed by slow cooling in the furnace. The resultant powder was then reground again and pressed with about 3 tons/cm^{2} into pellets which was then heated at 925-935 degC for 3 days in flowing oxygen, followed by annealing at 680 degC for 10 h and then slow cooled to 420 degC, where they remained for 20 h before a final slow cool to room temperature. All specimens were annealed in an atmosphere of flowing oxygen to ensure a sufficient oxygen content in the final product. This sinter procedure was repeated at least three times. All samples were prepared at the same time in the same furnace as much as to ensure the same sample qualities. The structures of the samples were investigated using a Rigaku Rotaflex rotating anode powder x-ray diffractometer (CuK\alpha radiation) at scanning rate of 4^{\circ} in 2\theta per minute.

The dc magnetization for each sample was measured by a Quantum Design magnetometer. To measure the Hall effect and the longitudinal resistivity a five-probe arrangement was used on rectangular shaped samples. The rectangular samples were cut from sintered pellets with typical dimensions 2\times5 \times0.5 mm.[3] In order to perform precise Hall measurements, it was essential to minimize the misalignment of the Hall arms and also to achieve low-resistance Ohmic contacts. The contacts were made using gold wires and silver epoxy. After a heat treatment of 2 h at 450 degC in flowing oxygen the contact resistance was typically less than 0.5 \Omega for contact surfaces smaller than 0.1 mm^{2}. Samples were mounted on small sapphire substrates.

In order to measure V_{xx} and V_{xy} simultaneously three voltage contacts were attached on each sample and recorded with two sensitive digital nanovoltmeters (Keithley 182). The experiments were performed in a commercial Oxford dewar with a superconducting magnet. The Hall voltage was obtained with a measuring current of 100 mA, which roughly corresponded to J\approx 10 - 40  A cm^{-2}. To extract the Hall voltage a signal was measured at two reversal directions of the measuring current and two reversal directions of the magnetic field (\pm7 T). The temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistivity in zero field was measured in a separate run. The temperature was measured by a carbon glass thermometer (Lake Shore carbon resistor type 500) inside the sample chamber with an Oxford ITC4 temperature controller.

## III Results and Discussion

The x-ray diffraction patterns at room temperature (Fig. 1) show that all samples have the layered orthorhombic perovskitelike structure and contain no extra peaks due to impurity phases within the experimental error. However, the orthorhombicity i.e., the e parameter, defined as e = 2(b-a)/(b+ a), decreases with increasing R^{3+} radius. The main peak split is not obvious for sample Nd_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (Fig. 1). The lattice parameters a, b, c and the unit cell volume V of all samples are increasing monotonically with radius of R^{3+} ion.

The temperature dependence of the dc molar magnetization M(T) of R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (R = Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, and Nd) systems over the temperature region 5-90 K were measured both in zero field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC). The results are shown in Fig. 2 (only for ZFC). The M(T) curves demonstrate a superconducting transition. In ZFC measurements, in some samples there are a "knee" on the transition curves. It could be due to the granular character of the sintered samples. The transition of sintered pellets could be divided as a two-step process with firstly the transition of grains and followed by the transition of intergrain

  barriers or junctions. The "knee" disappeared when we ground the bulk and performed the powder dc magnetic measurements.

Normal state resistivity r_{a} was measured in the temperature range between T_{c} and 290 K (Fig. 3). The results indicate that all samples are "metallic" with a linear temperature dependence of r_{a}. The resistivity at 280 K changes from 700 _m_d_m for Yb08Pr0.2BaCu3O7-y to 1700 _m_d_m_cm for Nd08Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-y. For all R0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-y samples the slopes of r_{a}(_T_) curves have a same value of _m_d_m_cm/K (Fig. 3).

Figure 4 demonstrated that T_{c} (onset) decreases approximately linearly with increasing radius of R3+ ions. This is consistent with our previous reports.4T_{c} values obtained from both resistivity and magnetization measurements are in good agreement with each other. It is the most striking aspect of these data that at a constant temperature (150 and 200 K in Fig. 5) the normal resistivity r_{n} increases linearly with increasing the R3+ ion size.

It is traditional to express a total electrical resistivity as the sum of two terms. One is the temperature-dependent term arising from the dynamic deviations from crystal perfection. Another is the temperature-independent residual resistivity arising from the static imperfections, such as impurities and lattice defects. The normal state resistivity r_{n} of R0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-y in the temperature range 100-290 K could be fitted by the relation, r_{n}(_T_) = r0+ _a_T_, where r0 is the extrapolated value of r_{a} at T = 0 and close to zero for undoped samples.

Figure 3: Temperature dependence of resistivity r for R0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-y (_R_ = Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, Nd).

  With increasing R3+ ion size, the resistivity curves r_{b}(_T_) are shifted progressively upwards (Fig. 3), so that the primary effect of the R ion size is to add a nominally temperature-independent contribution, r0, to the transport scattering rate. This may be due to a progressive decrease in carrier concentration (our Hall measurements support this point of view), or/and a progressive increase of an unsuspected temperature-independent scattering (impurity scattering) contribution by increasing R3+ ion size in samples.

The slopes of the r_{b}(_T_) curves, _d__p__n_/_dT_, for different _R_-ion samples (Fig. 3) are nearly identical. This suggests that the r0 is also R3+ ion size dependent. The r0 is larger for compound with larger R3+ ion size. It is obvious that the R3+ ion size dependence of r_{n} is a consequence of the R3+ ion size dependence of r0.

Hall measurements were made with the same samples which we discussed above. Our results demonstrated that the Hall voltage V_{y} at a constant temperature was linear in H and no saturation up to the maximum field of 7 Tesla.

The Hall coefficient R_{H} above T_{c} is holelike for all samples. The temperature dependence of R_{H} is shown in Fig. 6. The experimental values of R_{H} are in the range 0.5 x 10-9 m3/C to 4.8 x 10-9 m3/C. R_{H} increases as the temperature decreases, and then drops sharply as the superconducting transition temperature is approached. Figure 4 also demonstrates that the T_{c} (onset) values obtained from the Hall measurements are in agreement with those from the magnetization and the resistivity measurements.

It is convenient to normalize the Hall constant to the unit cell volume V so that, in the case of a parabolic single band, the Hall number n_{H} (derived from n_{H} = _V_/_e__R__H_) is the number of carriers per unit cell. The temperature dependence of the Hall number n_{H} is presented in Fig. 7.

As shown in Figs. 6 and 7, we find for R0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_ systems, a nearly 1/_T_ dependence of R_{H} and therefore, a nearly linear temperature dependence of n_{H}, widely seen in many high-_T__c_ cuprate superconductors. [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

The transport measurements performed in sintered bulk samples are usually complicated by the character of the granularity in these samples (weak links between grains) and confused by anisotropic effect inside the grains. In spite of this, we believed that averaging data from several repeated measurements will merge reliable results.

For every R0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_ compound, our Hall measurements were repeated on two samples with the same composition in order to double check for reproducibility. The typical results for Er0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_ are shown in Fig. 8. The data points fall on a straight line in the temperature range approximately below 240 K. We have estimated the signal error of our system is about 10-7-10-8 V. However, the Hall voltage V_{y} at low temperatures is in the order of 10-6 V and _V__xy_-1/_T_. Therefore, above 240 K the Hall signals are small and sensitive to thermal shift during the measurements. We suspect this to be a serious source of error at higher temperature in these samples.

A very significant feature of the Hall effect data is the existence of a R3+ ion size effect on Hall number n_{H} in R0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_ (Fig. 9). At a constant temperature the Hall number n_{H} decreases roughly linearly with increasing R3+ ionic radius.

It can be seen from Fig. 7 that for samples with smaller R3+ ionic radius (for example, Yb0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_) n_{H} varies linearly with T down to a few degrees above T_{c}, but for samples with larger R3+ ionic radius (for example, Nd0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_), the range of linearity shrinks.

A fundamental question for high-_T__c_ cuprate superconductors is whether or not the normal state from which the superconducting one condenses is a Fermi liquid. One signature of the Fermi liquid state is a quadratic dependence of electrical resistivity on temperature below the range in which

  phonon scattering dominates. The linear temperature dependence of the resistivity and Hall number appears implying a breakdown of the Fermi-liquid description.

Anderson has proposed a theory in the framework of the two-dimensional Luttinger liquid.[8] In his picture two types of quasiparticle excitations, spinons and holons, and two different relaxation times, \tau_{u} and \tau_{H}, have been introduced. The relaxation rates for carrier motion normal to the Fermi surface (1/\tau_{u}) is the usual transport relaxation rate. It is related to the spinon-holon scattering which leads to a linear T dependence, i.e., \tau_{u}\propto1/T, and determines the longitudinal conductivity \sigma_{xx}\propto\tau_{u}\propto1/T. The relaxation time for carrier motion parallel to the Fermi surface, \tau_{H}, is the transverse (Hall) relaxation time. It is the result of the scattering between spinons alone which varies as \tau_{H}\propto1/T^{2}. Thus, \sigma_{xy}\sim\tau_{H}\tau_{u}\sim1/T^{3}. The cotangent of the Hall angle becomes one of the essential quantities since it is dependent on \tau_{H} only:

\[\cot(\theta_{H}) = \sigma_{xx}/\sigma_{xy} = 1/\omega_{c}\tau_{H} = \alpha T^{2} + C\,,\] (1)

where \alpha is related to the spinon bandwidth W_{s} (\alpha\proptoW_{s}^{- 1}), and C is an additive term due to magnetic impurity scattering.

The simultaneous measurements of the Hall resistivity \rho_{xy}=R_{H}\mu and magnetic resistivity \rho_{xx} in field of 7 Tesla enable us to calculate accurately the cotangent of the Hall angle, cot \theta_{H} (=\rho_{xx}/\rho_{xy}). A universal quadratic temperature dependence of cot\theta_{H} is preserved in all samples of R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} systems (Fig. 10). The fan-shaped cot \theta_{H}(T^{2}) curves in Fig. 10 is a result from the fluctuation of signals at higher temperatures. The intercepts C and the slopes \alpha remain almost constant within small fluctuations. The slope \alpha as a function of the R^{3+} ionic radius is shown in Fig. 11.

Both \rho_{xx} and \rho_{xy} are approximately linearly with R^{3+} ionic radius (see Figs. 6 and 7), however, it seems that these two effects combine to weaken the ionic size dependence of cot\theta_{H}(=\rho_{xx}/\rho_{xy}).

Earlier Hall measurements[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] on 123-type high-T_{c} superconductors reveal that Eq. (1) seems to be universal in every system with different dopant and doping levels. However, the behavior of the slope \alpha and intercept C are quite different for different systems.

For the case of in-plane zinc dopants in crystals of YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Ref. [12]), C in Eq. (1) linearly increases with increasing zinc concentration, but the parameter \alpha is essentially unchanged, consistent with the interpretation that Zn is an in-plane scatterer and pair breaker[12] which has

  little effect on the carrier concentration. For the case of CuO-chain-sites cobalt doping in crystals of YBa2Cu1-CaCu3)O7-d (Ref. [13]), Co doping is thought to change the T_{c} by changing the hole concentration.[15] The results showed that doping with Co decreases \alpha while leaving the residual scattering parameter C unchanged.

For the case of oxygen-deficient YBa2Cu3O7-d epitaxial films,[9] the oxygen reduction (an increase in \delta), as in the case of Co doping, is thought to change the T_{c} by changing the hole concentration. However, the results showed that oxygen reduction increases \alpha, leaving the residual scattering parameter C unchanged.

For the case of the Y-site doping by Pr in Y1-_x_Pr.Ba2Cu3O7-d epitaxial films,[9] both \alpha and C increase with Pr concentration x. These results support the view that hybridization exists between Pr 4f states and the CuO2 plane electronic states, causing the Pr magnetic moment to become effective scatterer to the electron transport. The scattering by these moments reduces the carrier mobility, which corresponds to an increase in C. On the other hand, the increase in the slope \alpha indicates a drop in the true carrier density. These results imply that a combination of magnetic impurity scattering and hole filling (hole localization) is the mechanism for the suppression of superconductivity in Y1-_x_Pr.Ba2Cu3O7-_y_.

All of the Hall experiments above[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] reveal a unified picture of Hall effect in various high-T_{c} cuprate systems. While the increase of C corresponds to a reduction of mobility, the change of \alpha reflects the variation in true carrier density.[9]

All of the Hall experiments above[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] have focused on the change of the concentration x of the dopants or the oxygen reduction \delta, we carried out present Hall measurements in R_{0.8}Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_ systems, in which instead of changing the concentration, we change the R^{3+} ion while leaving the concentration of Pr and oxygen unchanged.

Our results are obviously different from those obtained from all the other systems. In our case both parameters \alpha and C, in formula of cost (\theta_{H})=\rho_{xx}/\rho_{xy}= \alpha T^{2}+C, remain almost constant and do not change with the changing of R in R_{0.8}Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_, although both magnetic and Hall resistivity, \rho_{xx} and \rho_{xy}, are significantly R^{3+} ion size dependent. A significant controversy arises over the role of parameters \alpha and C in Eq. (1) by comparing our results in R_{0.8}Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_ with results obtained in other systems.[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

In a unified picture of Hall effect as mentioned above, parameter C is a measure of the in-plane impurity scattering rate. It is not surprising that C is independent of R^{3+} ion substituted in Y site in R_{0.8}Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_. (The Pr ion also was substituted in the Y site, due to its hybridization with CuO2 planes it could reduce carrier mobility by the magnetic scattering, causing an increase in parameter C.) On the other hand, \rho_{0} is also a measure of the in-plane impurity scattering rate, but as shown in Fig. 5 it is strongly R^{3+} ion size dependent.

The change of \alpha was attributed to the variation in the true carrier density.[9] However, we observed that although the Hall number n_{H} decreases with increasing R^{3+} ion size while the parameter \alpha does not change with R^{3+} ion in R_{0.8}Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_ systems.

As mentioned earlier, we observed a strong R^{3+} ion-size effect on T_{c} (Fig. 4), \rho_{n} (Fig. 5) and n_{H} (Fig. 9) in R_{0.8}Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_. However, the Hall angle remains almost constant when we change the rare-earth ion in sample of R_{0.8}Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_. On the contrary to the conclusion in a number of previous studies,[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] our results strongly suggest that there is no simple correlation between the Hall angle in the normal state, including the parameters \alpha and C, with superconductivity (T_{c}) in 123-type high-T_{c} superconductors.

It should also be noted that a band model involving a square Fermi surface with rounded corners could also lead to the above T^{2} law.[16, 17] Therefore, one cannot conclude the validity of Anderson's picture simply based on the applicability of Eq. (1) to the observed results.

It has been well established that holes are the superconducting elements in the P-type high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors, and are mainly confined to the two-dimensional CuO2 sheet.[18] The high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors have been known to have a strong dependence of T_{c} on the hole content and a certain similar trend between T_{c} and the hole content exists in these individual series compounds.[19] High transition temperatures are found in a somewhat narrow window of hole concentration.

Several authors[19] suggested that T_{c} is an inverted parabolic function of carrier concentration in both the underdoped and the overdoped regions, i.e.,

\[T_{c} = T_{c,{\rm max}}[1 - \eta(n - n_{\rm opt})^{2}\rbrack,\]

where T_{c,{\rm max}} is the maximum T_{c} at the optimal doping level n_{\rm opt}. Such an empirical relation was well established in the case of Sr substituted La2CuO4.

Recently, Zhang and Sato[20] suggested a universal relationship between the normalized T_{c} and the hole content p_{\rm sh} (p_{\rm sh} is defined as the number of holes per CuO2 unit in the 2D layer). The universal curve is characterized by a plateau (0.12<p_{\rm sh}<0.25) with sharp bands at underdoped side (0.06<p_{\rm sh}<0.12) and overdoped side (0.25<p_{\rm sh}<0.31).

In both pictures mentioned above the hole concentration p_{\rm sh} in the covalent CuO2 sheets is given by conservation of charge. For a giving compound p_{\rm sh} is a constant and essentially independent on the temperature. p_{\rm sh} was measured by chemical methods (titration technique) or calculated by

  Rietveld analyses using a bond valence sum (BVS) model.[21] The chemical analyses should give a total number of charge in compounds and the BVS for the copper atoms should be taken to represent also the total charge in the bond.

_P_sh reflects the total number of the hole density which are not matched with Hall number n_{H}. n_{H} is related only to the "moving holes." In an isotropic parabolic single-band Fermi liquid system, the Hall number, n_{H} = _V_/_e__R__H_ would be the number of carriers per unit cell. For the high-_T__c_ cuprate superconductors, due to its T dependence and the complex band structure, n_{H} may not represent the actual carrier concentration. However, the value of n_{H} at a particular T correlates rather consistently with the carrier concentration determined by other methods, n_{H} scales with actual carrier concentration.

On the basis of our Hall effect measurements, we also found an empirical relation between the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} and the mobile carrier concentration n_{H}. Figure 12 presents the T_{c} as a function of the Hall number n_{H} (n_{H} at T = 100 K) for R0.8Pto2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ systems. The _T__c_-_n__H_ diagram (Fig. 12) manifests an "underdoping" behavior. The values of n_{H} at 100 K for several compounds fall out the limits of the superconducting window (0.06<_p_sh = 1/2 n_{H} < 0.31). The word "underdoping" is usually used in the case of the doping content below the optimum concentration, but in our case we only change the R ion in sample of R0.8Pto2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ while the composition remains constant. Our data established that the substitution by a R ion with larger ionic radius in R0.8Pto2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ is equivalent to increasing the Pr concentration in it.

In literature the Hall effect measurements on Y1-_g_Ptr2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ have been interpreted in the light of the "valent" model,[12] because a decrease of the Hall number n_{H} with the increase of Pr content has been observed. The strong T dependence of n_{H} in Fig. 9 complicates a determination of the true carrier density from n_{H}. Therefore, the decrease of n_{H} with x does not provide conclusive evidence for hole filling by the Pr dopant. The phenomena are connected not to the Pr4+ content, but to the "moving holes." It should be emphasized that the Hall number n_{H} changes by a factor of 2 from Yb0.8Pto2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ to Nd0.8Pto2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ in all temperature region 100-280 K (Fig. 7). Within the framework of the "valent" model one expects the n_{H}(_T_) dependence for the Yb and the Nd-based systems to be close to each other.

The suppression of T_{c} in R1-_g_Ptr2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ has been attributed to two possible mechanisms: the pair-breaking[23] and/or hole localization,[6] both due to hybridization of the Pr ion with the sandwiching CuO2 planes. Fehrenbacher and Rice[24] proposed a model for the electronic structure of PrBa2Cu3O7. The difference between PrBa2Cu3O7 and other _R_Ba2Cu3O7 superconductors comes from an enhanced stability of the PrIV state due to the hybridization with oxygen neighbors, and involves a transfer of holes from primarily planar O 2_p_s_ or to O 2p states. The resulting hybridized state is a mixture of Pr4+ and Pr3+ligand hole, i.e., the wave function has the form

\[\left| \Psi \right\rangle = \alpha\left| 4f^{1}p^{6} \right\rangle + \beta\left| 4f^{2}p^{5} \right\rangle.\]

If the weight of the b of the (Pr3+ L) state is large, many local properties of Pr, as seen by high-energy spectroscopy, would be similar to those of Pr3+. Furthermore, the orbital of 4f wave functions of the Pr ions are more spatially extended (Pr3+ is the largest paramagnetic rare earth that forms in the Y-Ba-Cu-O structure). This fact could enhance the hybridization between Pr orbital states and the valence band states associated with the CuO2 planes. Hybridization could generate an exchange interaction between the Pr magnetic moments and the spin of the mobile holes in the CuO2 planes.[24] This superexchange interaction between conducting holes and Pr magnetic moment in R1-_g_Ptr2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ systems is probably the mechanism of the pair-breaking and the hole localization (the reduction of the number of mobile holes n_{H}) leading to the T_{c} suppression.

The 4f wave function of the R (except Pr) ions with a symmetry different from Pr and with a smaller spatial extension does not lead to appreciable hybridization with the valence band states associated with the CuO2 planes. The conduction holes in the CuO2 planes have almost zero density of states at the R ion sites.[25] The R ions and the CuO2 layers are electronically decoupled.[26] The moment of R ions in R1-_g_Ptr2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ could not give an effect of pair-breaking or hole localization. However, the spatial extent of R ions (ionic radius) could produce a strong effect on the hybridization between valence band states of CuO2 planes and Pr 4f states. For R ions with a larger ionic radius in R1-_g_Ptr2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_, we observed a stronger T_{c} suppression by doping with the same Pr concentration. This is due to that the R ion with a larger ionic radius could enhance more strongly the hybridization between Pr orbital states and the valence band states of CuO2 planes.

We propose that as doping Pr in _R_Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ the hybridization between Pr 4f states and valence band states in the CuO2 planes provide an additional local impurity magnetic scattering by moment of Pr ions for resistivity (Kondo-like mechanism), and that the hybridization would result in localization of the mobile holes (the reduction of the number

  of mobile holes n_{H}) in the CuO_{2} planes. On the basis of our experiments both effects could be R ion-size dependent.

There is one difficulty to reconcile the trend in the behavior of Pr in different hosts RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} with the hybridization picture. For example, the T_{c} values and the critical concentration of Pr, x_{\rm cr}, necessary to suppression superconductivity are found to decrease with the increase of R^{3+} radius. One would expect the opposite effect based on the hybridization picture since increasing radius of rare earth R^{3+}, the average distance between CuO_{2} planes becomes larger which leads to a weaker Pr-CuO_{2} hybridization.

It is established [27] that the distance between Pr and the surrounding oxygen d_{\rm Pr\mathchar 45O} is less than d_{\rm Y\mathchar 45O} (most probably due to p-f hybridization). It is also known that increased local buckling of CuO_{2} planes suppresses T_{c} and inhibits metallic conductivity. Thus if the d_{\rm Pr\mathchar 45O} is the same in all hosts one would have stronger buckling around Pr for larger host R ions.

On the basis of our x-ray diffraction data, especially noteworthy is that the increase of c axis from 11.654 A for Yb_{0.9}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} to 11.748 A for Nd_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y}, is less than that of the ionic radii from 0.858 A for Yb^{3+} to 0.995 A for Nd^{3+}. The lattice undergoes a monotonic compression when the Y site in 123 series is substituted by R^{3+} with larger radius. All these facts may be connected with the increase of Pr-CuO_{2} hybridization and the role of localization with enlargement of R^{3+} ion radius.

Recently Norton _et al._ reported the results of the investigation of the transport and structural properties of Pr_{1-x}Ca_{2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} thin films.[28] Their results support the view that hole localization, due to hybridization of the Pr 4f electronic levels with the O 2p orbitals, contributes substantially to the suppression of superconductivity by Pr in PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y}, and demonstrates that this suppression can be partially compensated by appropriate hole doping with Ca.

In conclusion, we find a linear temperature dependence of the normal state resistivity \rho_{n} and the Hall number n_{H} in bulk R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} samples (R = Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, and Nd). At a constant temperature both \rho_{n} and n_{H} are linearly dependent on ion size of rare earth. The cotangent of the Hall angle follows a universal T_{2} dependence. Both the slope \alpha and the quantity C is insensitive to R ions and remains almost constant. We proposed a T_{c}-n_{H} diagram which manifests an "underdoping" behavior of R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} systems. We suggest that the strong hybridization between 4f states of the Pr ion and the conduction band states in CuO_{2} planes, leading to the hole localization and the pair breaking, are the mechanism for the suppression of superconductivity and the mechanism for the increase of resistivity \rho_{n} and reduction of the number of mobile holes n_{H} in the normal state in R_{1-x}Pr_{x} Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} systems. Especially noteworthy is that the R ion with a larger radius could more strongly enhance the hybridization between Pr orbital states and the valence band states of CuO_{2} planes. This is a natural explanation of the rare-earth ion size effect on T_{c} ,T_{N} ,\rho_{n} , and n_{H} , which we observed in the last several years.

###### Abstract

We report detailed studies of the normal-state resistivity and the Hall-effect in bulk R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} samples (R = Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, and Nd). We find a linear temperature dependence of the normal-state resistivity \rho_{u} and the Hall number n_{H} above T_{c} in these systems. At a constant temperature both \rho_{u} and n_{H} are linearly dependent on the ion-size of the rare earth, viz., the larger R^{3+} ionic radius, the larger \rho_{u}, but the lower n_{H}. The cotangent of the Hall angle follows a universal T^{2} dependence, i.e., \cot\theta_{H} = \alpha T^{2}+C. Both the slope \alpha and the quantity C is insensitive to the R ion and remains almost constant. On the basis of our data we propose a T_{c}-n_{H} diagram which manifests an "undergoping" behavior of R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} systems. We suggest that the strong hybridization between the 4f states of the Pr ion and the conduction-band states in CuO_{2} planes, leading to hole localization and pair breaking, are the mechanism for the suppression of superconductivity in R_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} systems.

## I Introduction

PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is an intriguing exception among the rare-earth substituted isomorphic YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} compounds due to the absence of superconductivity as well as a metallic state.[1] Specific heat and magnetization measurements[2] on PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} showed an anomalous magnetic ordering at T_{N}=17 K. Neutron diffraction[3] experiment suggested that this ordering is a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order in the Pr sublattice. One approach in understanding these striking properties of PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is to study in detail the effect of Pr doping in RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} compounds.[1]

The attractiveness of these systems is that the continuous composition range, 0<=x<=1, of solid solution formed in the R_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} systems based on different R provides a unique possibility to study the superconducting and magnetic subsystem interference.[1]

We have carried out systematic study of the effect by Pr doping in R_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} systems (R =Lu, Yb, Tm, Er, Y, Ho, Dy, Gd, Eu, Sm, and Nd).[4; 5; 6] It is found that at a critical Pr concentration, _x__{\rm cr}, the superconductivity is completely quenched, beyond which the system becomes insulating and displays magnetic ordering of the Pr sublattice. We observed a rare-earth ion size effect on T_{c}, T_{N}, and _x__{\rm cr} in these systems.

In Pr concentration region of _x_<_x__{\rm cr}, the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} decreases linearly with increasing Pr concentration, and that at a given Pr concentration, T_{c} decreases linearly with increasing the radius of R ion.[4]

On the other hand, in Pr concentration region of _x_>_x__{\rm cr}, the magnetic ordering temperature T_{N} of the Pr ions decreases linearly with increasing R concentration. At a given R concentration, T_{N} decreases linearly with decreasing the radius of R ion.[5]

We observed that the critical Pr concentration _x__{\rm cr} also decreases linearly with increasing the radius of R ion.[4] The observed results were interpreted in terms of the hybridization between the local states of Pr ion and the valence band states of the CuO_{2} planes.[6]

One of the most puzzling problems in the study of high-T_{c} superconductors has been the anomalous linear temperature dependence of their normal-state resistivity \rho_{u} and the Hall number n_{H} above T_{c},[7] which is inconsistent with an isotropic single-band Fermi-liquid description. A theory in the framework of the two-dimensional Luttinger liquid was proposed by Anderson,[8] who argues that the intrinsic electronic freedom in CuO_{2} planes is decomposed into two types of quasiparticle excitations, spin-\frac{1}{2} chargeless spinons and charged spinless holons. The relaxation times for carrier motion normal to the Fermi surface and parallel to it are differentiated. The predicted T^{2}-dependence of the Hall angle has been observed in many high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors.[9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14]

Extensive studies of the Hall effect have been carried out on the following 123-systems: (1) YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} with changing the oxygen content \delta,[9; 10] (2) Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} with changing the Pr content x;[11] and (3) YBa_{2}Cu_{3-x}M_{x}O_{7-\delta} with changing the transition metal content x.[12; 13; 14]

All of the Hall experiments above[9; 10; 11] have focused on the change of the concentration x of the dopants (Zn, Co, Fe, Pr) or the oxygen reduction x. In modification of our previous  observation that the R^{3+} ion size has a very strong effect on superconducting and magnetic properties in R_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y}[4, 5, 6] we carried out present Hall measurements in R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}Pr_{7-y} systems, in which instead of changing the concentration, we change the R^{3+} ion while leaving the concentration of Pr and oxygen unchanged.

In this paper we report detailed studies of the normal state resistivity and Hall effect of bulk (R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (R =Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, and Nd). We find a linear temperature dependence of the resistivity \rho_{n} and the Hall number n_{H} above T_{c} in these systems. The cotangent of the Hall angle follows a universal T^{2} dependence, namely, cot \theta=\,\alpha T^{2}+C. Both the slope \alpha and the quantity C remain almost constant and are insensitive to the change of R ion in R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y}. We find a rare-earth ion size effect on resistivity \rho_{n} and the Hall number n_{H}. At a constant temperature the resistivity \rho_{n} and the Hall number n_{H} is linearly dependent on R^{3+} ionic radius, the larger R^{3+} ionic radius, the larger \rho_{n} , but the lower n_{H}. Based on our data we proposed a T_{c}-n_{H} diagram which manifests an underdopinglike behavior of R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (R =Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, and Nd) systems.

## II Experimental

The ceramic R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (R =Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, and Nd) samples were synthesized using a conventional solid state reaction method. Stoichiometric amounts of high purity R_{2}O_{3} (R =Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, and Nd), Pr_{6}O_{11}, BaCo_{3} and CuO powders were mixed, ground and calcined at 915 degC for about 24 h in air in Al_{2}O_{3} crucibles, followed by slow cooling in the furnace. The resultant powder was then reground again and pressed with about 3 tons/cm^{2} into pellets which was then heated at 925-935 degC for 3 days in flowing oxygen, followed by annealing at 680 degC for 10 h and then slow cooled to 420 degC, where they remained for 20 h before a final slow cool to room temperature. All specimens were annealed in an atmosphere of flowing oxygen to ensure a sufficient oxygen content in the final product. This sinter procedure was repeated at least three times. All samples were prepared at the same time in the same furnace as much as to ensure the same sample qualities. The structures of the samples were investigated using a Rigaku Rotaflex rotating anode powder x-ray diffractometer (CuK\alpha radiation) at scanning rate of 4^{\circ} in 2\theta per minute.

The dc magnetization for each sample was measured by a Quantum Design magnetometer. To measure the Hall effect and the longitudinal resistivity a five-probe arrangement was used on rectangular shaped samples. The rectangular samples were cut from sintered pellets with typical dimensions 2\times5 \times0.5 mm.[3] In order to perform precise Hall measurements, it was essential to minimize the misalignment of the Hall arms and also to achieve low-resistance Ohmic contacts. The contacts were made using gold wires and silver epoxy. After a heat treatment of 2 h at 450 degC in flowing oxygen the contact resistance was typically less than 0.5 \Omega for contact surfaces smaller than 0.1 mm^{2}. Samples were mounted on small sapphire substrates.

In order to measure V_{xx} and V_{xy} simultaneously three voltage contacts were attached on each sample and recorded with two sensitive digital nanovoltmeters (Keithley 182). The experiments were performed in a commercial Oxford dewar with a superconducting magnet. The Hall voltage was obtained with a measuring current of 100 mA, which roughly corresponded to J\approx 10 - 40  A cm^{-2}. To extract the Hall voltage a signal was measured at two reversal directions of the measuring current and two reversal directions of the magnetic field (\pm7 T). The temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistivity in zero field was measured in a separate run. The temperature was measured by a carbon glass thermometer (Lake Shore carbon resistor type 500) inside the sample chamber with an Oxford ITC4 temperature controller.

## III Results and Discussion

The x-ray diffraction patterns at room temperature (Fig. 1) show that all samples have the layered orthorhombic perovskitelike structure and contain no extra peaks due to impurity phases within the experimental error. However, the orthorhombicity i.e., the e parameter, defined as e = 2(b-a)/(b+ a), decreases with increasing R^{3+} radius. The main peak split is not obvious for sample Nd_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (Fig. 1). The lattice parameters a, b, c and the unit cell volume V of all samples are increasing monotonically with radius of R^{3+} ion.

The temperature dependence of the dc molar magnetization M(T) of R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (R = Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, and Nd) systems over the temperature region 5-90 K were measured both in zero field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC). The results are shown in Fig. 2 (only for ZFC). The M(T) curves demonstrate a superconducting transition. In ZFC measurements, in some samples there are a "knee" on the transition curves. It could be due to the granular character of the sintered samples. The transition of sintered pellets could be divided as a two-step process with firstly the transition of grains and followed by the transition of intergrain

  barriers or junctions. The "knee" disappeared when we ground the bulk and performed the powder dc magnetic measurements.

Normal state resistivity r_{a} was measured in the temperature range between T_{c} and 290 K (Fig. 3). The results indicate that all samples are "metallic" with a linear temperature dependence of r_{a}. The resistivity at 280 K changes from 700 _m_d_m for Yb08Pr0.2BaCu3O7-y to 1700 _m_d_m_cm for Nd08Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-y. For all R0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-y samples the slopes of r_{a}(_T_) curves have a same value of _m_d_m_cm/K (Fig. 3).

Figure 4 demonstrated that T_{c} (onset) decreases approximately linearly with increasing radius of R3+ ions. This is consistent with our previous reports.4T_{c} values obtained from both resistivity and magnetization measurements are in good agreement with each other. It is the most striking aspect of these data that at a constant temperature (150 and 200 K in Fig. 5) the normal resistivity r_{n} increases linearly with increasing the R3+ ion size.

It is traditional to express a total electrical resistivity as the sum of two terms. One is the temperature-dependent term arising from the dynamic deviations from crystal perfection. Another is the temperature-independent residual resistivity arising from the static imperfections, such as impurities and lattice defects. The normal state resistivity r_{n} of R0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-y in the temperature range 100-290 K could be fitted by the relation, r_{n}(_T_) = r0+ _a_T_, where r0 is the extrapolated value of r_{a} at T = 0 and close to zero for undoped samples.

Figure 3: Temperature dependence of resistivity r for R0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-y (_R_ = Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, Nd).

  With increasing R3+ ion size, the resistivity curves r_{b}(_T_) are shifted progressively upwards (Fig. 3), so that the primary effect of the R ion size is to add a nominally temperature-independent contribution, r0, to the transport scattering rate. This may be due to a progressive decrease in carrier concentration (our Hall measurements support this point of view), or/and a progressive increase of an unsuspected temperature-independent scattering (impurity scattering) contribution by increasing R3+ ion size in samples.

The slopes of the r_{b}(_T_) curves, _d__p__n_/_dT_, for different _R_-ion samples (Fig. 3) are nearly identical. This suggests that the r0 is also R3+ ion size dependent. The r0 is larger for compound with larger R3+ ion size. It is obvious that the R3+ ion size dependence of r_{n} is a consequence of the R3+ ion size dependence of r0.

Hall measurements were made with the same samples which we discussed above. Our results demonstrated that the Hall voltage V_{y} at a constant temperature was linear in H and no saturation up to the maximum field of 7 Tesla.

The Hall coefficient R_{H} above T_{c} is holelike for all samples. The temperature dependence of R_{H} is shown in Fig. 6. The experimental values of R_{H} are in the range 0.5 x 10-9 m3/C to 4.8 x 10-9 m3/C. R_{H} increases as the temperature decreases, and then drops sharply as the superconducting transition temperature is approached. Figure 4 also demonstrates that the T_{c} (onset) values obtained from the Hall measurements are in agreement with those from the magnetization and the resistivity measurements.

It is convenient to normalize the Hall constant to the unit cell volume V so that, in the case of a parabolic single band, the Hall number n_{H} (derived from n_{H} = _V_/_e__R__H_) is the number of carriers per unit cell. The temperature dependence of the Hall number n_{H} is presented in Fig. 7.

As shown in Figs. 6 and 7, we find for R0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_ systems, a nearly 1/_T_ dependence of R_{H} and therefore, a nearly linear temperature dependence of n_{H}, widely seen in many high-_T__c_ cuprate superconductors. [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

The transport measurements performed in sintered bulk samples are usually complicated by the character of the granularity in these samples (weak links between grains) and confused by anisotropic effect inside the grains. In spite of this, we believed that averaging data from several repeated measurements will merge reliable results.

For every R0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_ compound, our Hall measurements were repeated on two samples with the same composition in order to double check for reproducibility. The typical results for Er0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_ are shown in Fig. 8. The data points fall on a straight line in the temperature range approximately below 240 K. We have estimated the signal error of our system is about 10-7-10-8 V. However, the Hall voltage V_{y} at low temperatures is in the order of 10-6 V and _V__xy_-1/_T_. Therefore, above 240 K the Hall signals are small and sensitive to thermal shift during the measurements. We suspect this to be a serious source of error at higher temperature in these samples.

A very significant feature of the Hall effect data is the existence of a R3+ ion size effect on Hall number n_{H} in R0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_ (Fig. 9). At a constant temperature the Hall number n_{H} decreases roughly linearly with increasing R3+ ionic radius.

It can be seen from Fig. 7 that for samples with smaller R3+ ionic radius (for example, Yb0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_) n_{H} varies linearly with T down to a few degrees above T_{c}, but for samples with larger R3+ ionic radius (for example, Nd0.8Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_), the range of linearity shrinks.

A fundamental question for high-_T__c_ cuprate superconductors is whether or not the normal state from which the superconducting one condenses is a Fermi liquid. One signature of the Fermi liquid state is a quadratic dependence of electrical resistivity on temperature below the range in which

  phonon scattering dominates. The linear temperature dependence of the resistivity and Hall number appears implying a breakdown of the Fermi-liquid description.

Anderson has proposed a theory in the framework of the two-dimensional Luttinger liquid.[8] In his picture two types of quasiparticle excitations, spinons and holons, and two different relaxation times, \tau_{u} and \tau_{H}, have been introduced. The relaxation rates for carrier motion normal to the Fermi surface (1/\tau_{u}) is the usual transport relaxation rate. It is related to the spinon-holon scattering which leads to a linear T dependence, i.e., \tau_{u}\propto1/T, and determines the longitudinal conductivity \sigma_{xx}\propto\tau_{u}\propto1/T. The relaxation time for carrier motion parallel to the Fermi surface, \tau_{H}, is the transverse (Hall) relaxation time. It is the result of the scattering between spinons alone which varies as \tau_{H}\propto1/T^{2}. Thus, \sigma_{xy}\sim\tau_{H}\tau_{u}\sim1/T^{3}. The cotangent of the Hall angle becomes one of the essential quantities since it is dependent on \tau_{H} only:

\[\cot(\theta_{H}) = \sigma_{xx}/\sigma_{xy} = 1/\omega_{c}\tau_{H} = \alpha T^{2} + C\,,\] (1)

where \alpha is related to the spinon bandwidth W_{s} (\alpha\proptoW_{s}^{- 1}), and C is an additive term due to magnetic impurity scattering.

The simultaneous measurements of the Hall resistivity \rho_{xy}=R_{H}\mu and magnetic resistivity \rho_{xx} in field of 7 Tesla enable us to calculate accurately the cotangent of the Hall angle, cot \theta_{H} (=\rho_{xx}/\rho_{xy}). A universal quadratic temperature dependence of cot\theta_{H} is preserved in all samples of R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} systems (Fig. 10). The fan-shaped cot \theta_{H}(T^{2}) curves in Fig. 10 is a result from the fluctuation of signals at higher temperatures. The intercepts C and the slopes \alpha remain almost constant within small fluctuations. The slope \alpha as a function of the R^{3+} ionic radius is shown in Fig. 11.

Both \rho_{xx} and \rho_{xy} are approximately linearly with R^{3+} ionic radius (see Figs. 6 and 7), however, it seems that these two effects combine to weaken the ionic size dependence of cot\theta_{H}(=\rho_{xx}/\rho_{xy}).

Earlier Hall measurements[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] on 123-type high-T_{c} superconductors reveal that Eq. (1) seems to be universal in every system with different dopant and doping levels. However, the behavior of the slope \alpha and intercept C are quite different for different systems.

For the case of in-plane zinc dopants in crystals of YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Ref. [12]), C in Eq. (1) linearly increases with increasing zinc concentration, but the parameter \alpha is essentially unchanged, consistent with the interpretation that Zn is an in-plane scatterer and pair breaker[12] which has

  little effect on the carrier concentration. For the case of CuO-chain-sites cobalt doping in crystals of YBa2Cu1-CaCu3)O7-d (Ref. [13]), Co doping is thought to change the T_{c} by changing the hole concentration.[15] The results showed that doping with Co decreases \alpha while leaving the residual scattering parameter C unchanged.

For the case of oxygen-deficient YBa2Cu3O7-d epitaxial films,[9] the oxygen reduction (an increase in \delta), as in the case of Co doping, is thought to change the T_{c} by changing the hole concentration. However, the results showed that oxygen reduction increases \alpha, leaving the residual scattering parameter C unchanged.

For the case of the Y-site doping by Pr in Y1-_x_Pr.Ba2Cu3O7-d epitaxial films,[9] both \alpha and C increase with Pr concentration x. These results support the view that hybridization exists between Pr 4f states and the CuO2 plane electronic states, causing the Pr magnetic moment to become effective scatterer to the electron transport. The scattering by these moments reduces the carrier mobility, which corresponds to an increase in C. On the other hand, the increase in the slope \alpha indicates a drop in the true carrier density. These results imply that a combination of magnetic impurity scattering and hole filling (hole localization) is the mechanism for the suppression of superconductivity in Y1-_x_Pr.Ba2Cu3O7-_y_.

All of the Hall experiments above[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] reveal a unified picture of Hall effect in various high-T_{c} cuprate systems. While the increase of C corresponds to a reduction of mobility, the change of \alpha reflects the variation in true carrier density.[9]

All of the Hall experiments above[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] have focused on the change of the concentration x of the dopants or the oxygen reduction \delta, we carried out present Hall measurements in R_{0.8}Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_ systems, in which instead of changing the concentration, we change the R^{3+} ion while leaving the concentration of Pr and oxygen unchanged.

Our results are obviously different from those obtained from all the other systems. In our case both parameters \alpha and C, in formula of cost (\theta_{H})=\rho_{xx}/\rho_{xy}= \alpha T^{2}+C, remain almost constant and do not change with the changing of R in R_{0.8}Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_, although both magnetic and Hall resistivity, \rho_{xx} and \rho_{xy}, are significantly R^{3+} ion size dependent. A significant controversy arises over the role of parameters \alpha and C in Eq. (1) by comparing our results in R_{0.8}Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_ with results obtained in other systems.[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

In a unified picture of Hall effect as mentioned above, parameter C is a measure of the in-plane impurity scattering rate. It is not surprising that C is independent of R^{3+} ion substituted in Y site in R_{0.8}Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_. (The Pr ion also was substituted in the Y site, due to its hybridization with CuO2 planes it could reduce carrier mobility by the magnetic scattering, causing an increase in parameter C.) On the other hand, \rho_{0} is also a measure of the in-plane impurity scattering rate, but as shown in Fig. 5 it is strongly R^{3+} ion size dependent.

The change of \alpha was attributed to the variation in the true carrier density.[9] However, we observed that although the Hall number n_{H} decreases with increasing R^{3+} ion size while the parameter \alpha does not change with R^{3+} ion in R_{0.8}Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_ systems.

As mentioned earlier, we observed a strong R^{3+} ion-size effect on T_{c} (Fig. 4), \rho_{n} (Fig. 5) and n_{H} (Fig. 9) in R_{0.8}Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_. However, the Hall angle remains almost constant when we change the rare-earth ion in sample of R_{0.8}Pr0.2Ba2Cu3O7-_y_. On the contrary to the conclusion in a number of previous studies,[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] our results strongly suggest that there is no simple correlation between the Hall angle in the normal state, including the parameters \alpha and C, with superconductivity (T_{c}) in 123-type high-T_{c} superconductors.

It should also be noted that a band model involving a square Fermi surface with rounded corners could also lead to the above T^{2} law.[16, 17] Therefore, one cannot conclude the validity of Anderson's picture simply based on the applicability of Eq. (1) to the observed results.

It has been well established that holes are the superconducting elements in the P-type high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors, and are mainly confined to the two-dimensional CuO2 sheet.[18] The high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors have been known to have a strong dependence of T_{c} on the hole content and a certain similar trend between T_{c} and the hole content exists in these individual series compounds.[19] High transition temperatures are found in a somewhat narrow window of hole concentration.

Several authors[19] suggested that T_{c} is an inverted parabolic function of carrier concentration in both the underdoped and the overdoped regions, i.e.,

\[T_{c} = T_{c,{\rm max}}[1 - \eta(n - n_{\rm opt})^{2}\rbrack,\]

where T_{c,{\rm max}} is the maximum T_{c} at the optimal doping level n_{\rm opt}. Such an empirical relation was well established in the case of Sr substituted La2CuO4.

Recently, Zhang and Sato[20] suggested a universal relationship between the normalized T_{c} and the hole content p_{\rm sh} (p_{\rm sh} is defined as the number of holes per CuO2 unit in the 2D layer). The universal curve is characterized by a plateau (0.12<p_{\rm sh}<0.25) with sharp bands at underdoped side (0.06<p_{\rm sh}<0.12) and overdoped side (0.25<p_{\rm sh}<0.31).

In both pictures mentioned above the hole concentration p_{\rm sh} in the covalent CuO2 sheets is given by conservation of charge. For a giving compound p_{\rm sh} is a constant and essentially independent on the temperature. p_{\rm sh} was measured by chemical methods (titration technique) or calculated by

  Rietveld analyses using a bond valence sum (BVS) model.[21] The chemical analyses should give a total number of charge in compounds and the BVS for the copper atoms should be taken to represent also the total charge in the bond.

_P_sh reflects the total number of the hole density which are not matched with Hall number n_{H}. n_{H} is related only to the "moving holes." In an isotropic parabolic single-band Fermi liquid system, the Hall number, n_{H} = _V_/_e__R__H_ would be the number of carriers per unit cell. For the high-_T__c_ cuprate superconductors, due to its T dependence and the complex band structure, n_{H} may not represent the actual carrier concentration. However, the value of n_{H} at a particular T correlates rather consistently with the carrier concentration determined by other methods, n_{H} scales with actual carrier concentration.

On the basis of our Hall effect measurements, we also found an empirical relation between the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} and the mobile carrier concentration n_{H}. Figure 12 presents the T_{c} as a function of the Hall number n_{H} (n_{H} at T = 100 K) for R0.8Pto2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ systems. The _T__c_-_n__H_ diagram (Fig. 12) manifests an "underdoping" behavior. The values of n_{H} at 100 K for several compounds fall out the limits of the superconducting window (0.06<_p_sh = 1/2 n_{H} < 0.31). The word "underdoping" is usually used in the case of the doping content below the optimum concentration, but in our case we only change the R ion in sample of R0.8Pto2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ while the composition remains constant. Our data established that the substitution by a R ion with larger ionic radius in R0.8Pto2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ is equivalent to increasing the Pr concentration in it.

In literature the Hall effect measurements on Y1-_g_Ptr2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ have been interpreted in the light of the "valent" model,[12] because a decrease of the Hall number n_{H} with the increase of Pr content has been observed. The strong T dependence of n_{H} in Fig. 9 complicates a determination of the true carrier density from n_{H}. Therefore, the decrease of n_{H} with x does not provide conclusive evidence for hole filling by the Pr dopant. The phenomena are connected not to the Pr4+ content, but to the "moving holes." It should be emphasized that the Hall number n_{H} changes by a factor of 2 from Yb0.8Pto2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ to Nd0.8Pto2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ in all temperature region 100-280 K (Fig. 7). Within the framework of the "valent" model one expects the n_{H}(_T_) dependence for the Yb and the Nd-based systems to be close to each other.

The suppression of T_{c} in R1-_g_Ptr2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ has been attributed to two possible mechanisms: the pair-breaking[23] and/or hole localization,[6] both due to hybridization of the Pr ion with the sandwiching CuO2 planes. Fehrenbacher and Rice[24] proposed a model for the electronic structure of PrBa2Cu3O7. The difference between PrBa2Cu3O7 and other _R_Ba2Cu3O7 superconductors comes from an enhanced stability of the PrIV state due to the hybridization with oxygen neighbors, and involves a transfer of holes from primarily planar O 2_p_s_ or to O 2p states. The resulting hybridized state is a mixture of Pr4+ and Pr3+ligand hole, i.e., the wave function has the form

\[\left| \Psi \right\rangle = \alpha\left| 4f^{1}p^{6} \right\rangle + \beta\left| 4f^{2}p^{5} \right\rangle.\]

If the weight of the b of the (Pr3+ L) state is large, many local properties of Pr, as seen by high-energy spectroscopy, would be similar to those of Pr3+. Furthermore, the orbital of 4f wave functions of the Pr ions are more spatially extended (Pr3+ is the largest paramagnetic rare earth that forms in the Y-Ba-Cu-O structure). This fact could enhance the hybridization between Pr orbital states and the valence band states associated with the CuO2 planes. Hybridization could generate an exchange interaction between the Pr magnetic moments and the spin of the mobile holes in the CuO2 planes.[24] This superexchange interaction between conducting holes and Pr magnetic moment in R1-_g_Ptr2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ systems is probably the mechanism of the pair-breaking and the hole localization (the reduction of the number of mobile holes n_{H}) leading to the T_{c} suppression.

The 4f wave function of the R (except Pr) ions with a symmetry different from Pr and with a smaller spatial extension does not lead to appreciable hybridization with the valence band states associated with the CuO2 planes. The conduction holes in the CuO2 planes have almost zero density of states at the R ion sites.[25] The R ions and the CuO2 layers are electronically decoupled.[26] The moment of R ions in R1-_g_Ptr2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ could not give an effect of pair-breaking or hole localization. However, the spatial extent of R ions (ionic radius) could produce a strong effect on the hybridization between valence band states of CuO2 planes and Pr 4f states. For R ions with a larger ionic radius in R1-_g_Ptr2Ba2Cu3O7-_g_, we observed a stronger T_{c} suppression by doping with the same Pr concentration. This is due to that the R ion with a larger ionic radius could enhance more strongly the hybridization between Pr orbital states and the valence band states of CuO2 planes.

We propose that as doping Pr in _R_Ba2Cu3O7-_g_ the hybridization between Pr 4f states and valence band states in the CuO2 planes provide an additional local impurity magnetic scattering by moment of Pr ions for resistivity (Kondo-like mechanism), and that the hybridization would result in localization of the mobile holes (the reduction of the number

  of mobile holes n_{H}) in the CuO_{2} planes. On the basis of our experiments both effects could be R ion-size dependent.

There is one difficulty to reconcile the trend in the behavior of Pr in different hosts RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} with the hybridization picture. For example, the T_{c} values and the critical concentration of Pr, x_{\rm cr}, necessary to suppression superconductivity are found to decrease with the increase of R^{3+} radius. One would expect the opposite effect based on the hybridization picture since increasing radius of rare earth R^{3+}, the average distance between CuO_{2} planes becomes larger which leads to a weaker Pr-CuO_{2} hybridization.

It is established [27] that the distance between Pr and the surrounding oxygen d_{\rm Pr\mathchar 45O} is less than d_{\rm Y\mathchar 45O} (most probably due to p-f hybridization). It is also known that increased local buckling of CuO_{2} planes suppresses T_{c} and inhibits metallic conductivity. Thus if the d_{\rm Pr\mathchar 45O} is the same in all hosts one would have stronger buckling around Pr for larger host R ions.

On the basis of our x-ray diffraction data, especially noteworthy is that the increase of c axis from 11.654 A for Yb_{0.9}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} to 11.748 A for Nd_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y}, is less than that of the ionic radii from 0.858 A for Yb^{3+} to 0.995 A for Nd^{3+}. The lattice undergoes a monotonic compression when the Y site in 123 series is substituted by R^{3+} with larger radius. All these facts may be connected with the increase of Pr-CuO_{2} hybridization and the role of localization with enlargement of R^{3+} ion radius.

Recently Norton _et al._ reported the results of the investigation of the transport and structural properties of Pr_{1-x}Ca_{2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} thin films.[28] Their results support the view that hole localization, due to hybridization of the Pr 4f electronic levels with the O 2p orbitals, contributes substantially to the suppression of superconductivity by Pr in PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y}, and demonstrates that this suppression can be partially compensated by appropriate hole doping with Ca.

In conclusion, we find a linear temperature dependence of the normal state resistivity \rho_{n} and the Hall number n_{H} in bulk R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} samples (R = Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, and Nd). At a constant temperature both \rho_{n} and n_{H} are linearly dependent on ion size of rare earth. The cotangent of the Hall angle follows a universal T_{2} dependence. Both the slope \alpha and the quantity C is insensitive to R ions and remains almost constant. We proposed a T_{c}-n_{H} diagram which manifests an "underdoping" behavior of R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} systems. We suggest that the strong hybridization between 4f states of the Pr ion and the conduction band states in CuO_{2} planes, leading to the hole localization and the pair breaking, are the mechanism for the suppression of superconductivity and the mechanism for the increase of resistivity \rho_{n} and reduction of the number of mobile holes n_{H} in the normal state in R_{1-x}Pr_{x} Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} systems. Especially noteworthy is that the R ion with a larger radius could more strongly enhance the hybridization between Pr orbital states and the valence band states of CuO_{2} planes. This is a natural explanation of the rare-earth ion size effect on T_{c} ,T_{N} ,\rho_{n} , and n_{H} , which we observed in the last several years.
