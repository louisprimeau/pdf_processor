28 January 201128 January 2  FeSe_{0.8}S_{0.2} were prepared by reacting high-purity powder of iron, selenium, and sulfur at 650 ^{\circ}C for 12 hours. Then, the synthesized powder and K pieces were put into a small quartz tube with nominal compositions of K_{0.8}Fe_{2}Se_{2} and K_{0.8}Fe_{2}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4}, respectively. The small quartz tube was sealed under high vacuum, put in a larger quartz tube, and was then followed by evacuating and being sealed. The mixture was heated up to 1050 ^{\circ}C and kept over 4 hours. Afterward the melt was cooled down to 700 ^{\circ}C with the cooling rate 6 ^{\circ}C/h before the furnace was shut down.

The obtained crystals were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray single crystal diffraction with Cu K_{\alpha} radiation at room temperature. Actual composition of the crystals was confirmed using energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectrometry. The resistivity was measured by using a standard four-probe method in a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). Magnetic properties were investigated using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. ESR measurements were performed using a Bruker EMX plus 10/12 CW-spectrometer at X-band frequencies (f\approx 9.36 GHz) equipped with a continuous He gas-flow cryostat in the temperature region of 2-300 K by sweeping magnetic field parallel to the ab-plane and c-axis.

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1 shows the single crystal and powder XRD patterns for K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4}. For both components, only (_001_) diffraction peaks appear in the single crystal XRD patterns, indicating that the c-axis is perpendicular to the cleavage surface. To examine the purity of the prepared crystals, we further performed powder XRD measurements by grinding several slides into powder for each component. All the peaks can be well indexed with the symmetry of 14/mmun, and no impurity phase is observed. The calculated-lattice parameters are a=3.9106 A, c=14.0663 A for K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} and a=3.8560 A, c=14.0344 A for K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4}, similar to previously reported values.[13, 14, 15]

Slight shrinkage of the lattice in K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4} indicates effective substitution of S for Se in the as-grown single crystals. The average stoichiometry of the as-grown samples was determined from EDX by examination of multiple points in the crystals. The measured compositions are K_{0.79}Fe_{1.64(2)}Se_{2.00} and K_{0.74}Fe_{1.67(5)}Se_{1.61}S_{0.40}. We also measured the composition mapping using EDX. The results show that the spatial distribution of K, Fe, Se and S, is homogenous.

Figure 2 presents the in-plane resistivity and susceptibility results of the parent compound K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}. At high temperature, the resistivity increases with decreasing temperature and exhibits a broad hump at about 120 K. With further cooling, metallic transport behavior is observed, followed by superconducting transition at T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset}\sim 31.3 K. The abnormal hump in the resistivity curve has also been observed in Rb_{0.8}Fe_{2}Se_{2} and Cs_{0.8}Fe_{2}Se_{2}, seemly to be a common feature in this system.[16, 17, 29] The temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility with H=10 Oe under both zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) conditions is given in the upper-right inset of Fig. 2. It shows that the superconducting shield begins to emerge at about 30.4 K. The superconducting volume fraction estimated from the ZFC magnetization at 4 K is about 92%, which indicates the bulk superconductivity nature of the crystals. The upper-left inset shows the magnetic susceptibility of K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} with the magnetic field of 1 T applied parallel to the c-axis. A sudden drop at about 30 K corresponds to the superconducting transition. The magnetic susceptibility weakly decreases with temperature below 300 K and exhibits a weak upturn below 140 K. The decrease in susceptibility with decreasing temperature at high temperatures has been correlated to the antiferromagnetism.[30, 31]

The temperature dependence of resistivity for the K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4} sample is shown in Fig. 3. The hump temperature T_{\rm H}\sim 131 K is slightly higher than that in K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}. The lower inset of Fig. 3 shows the details of the superconducting transition; the onset and zero-resistivity

The lower inset shows an enlarged view of superconducting transition from 27 K to 32 K. The ZFC and FC susceptibility taken at 10 Oe with the magnetic field parallel to the ab-plane is shown in the upper-right inset. The upper-left inset shows the magnetic susceptibility of K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} with the magnetic field of 1 T applied parallel to the c-axis.

  temperature were determined to be T_{c}^{\rm onset} = 32.8 K and T_{c}^{\rm zero} = 31.2 K, respectively. Both of them are slightly higher than those of the parent compound K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4} with that reported by Lei _et al._[32] - Resistivity as a function of temperature under the magnetic field (H = 14 T) applied in ab-plane and along c-axis is also shown in Fig. 3. The transition temperature of superconductivity is suppressed, and the transition is broadened under external magnetic field; see the upper inset of Fig. 3. An obvious difference for the effect of field along a different direction on the superconductivity indicates the existence of anisotropy in K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4} crystal. However, the hump peak in the resistivity curve has no obvious shift when applying magnetic field with no-matter H//c-axis or H//ab-plane.

Diamagnetism at low temperature in K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4} can be clearly observed in magnetization measurements with magnetic field of 100 Oe, as seen in Fig. 4. The onset temperature T_{c}^{\rm mag} of about 31 K is almost identical to the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}^{\rm zero} in resistivity measurements. The inset of Fig. 4 shows magnetic susceptibility of K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4} with the magnetic field of 1 T applied parallel to the c-axis and ab-plane from 10 K to 300 K. At low temperature, superconducting trace still exists, as revealed by the drop of susceptibility. Whether or not the external field is parallel to the c-axis, the magnetic susceptibility continually decreases with increasing the temperature from 33 K to 300 K, in disagreement with the case in parent compound K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}. The difference suggests that the magnetism is distinctly changed by the substitution of S for Se.

Since the ionic radius of S is smaller than that of Se, the substitution should produce positive chemical pressure. Recently, J. Guo _et al_. reported that both the T_{c}^{\rm onset} and T_{c}^{\rm zero} of K_{0.8}Fe_{1.7}Se_{2} decreased with increasing pressure, and superconductivity disappeared under pressure above 9.2 GPa.[33] Similar suppression of superconductivity under external pressure was also found in K_{0.85}Fe_{2}Se_{1.80} and Cs_{0.86}Fe_{1.66}Se_{2}.[34] However, Kawasaki _et al_. reported that T_{c}^{\rm onset} increases with increasing pressure, while T_{c}^{\rm zero} decreases.[35] In present work the doping with S does not decrease the transition temperature, implying that the effect of chemical pressure on superconductivity is different from that of external pressure. Considering AFe_{2}Se_{2}, the bond between the FeSe layers is via weak van der Waals force, which is fragile to external pressure. In contrast the substitution of S for Se may have more affect on modulating the bond between Fe and Se, thereby decreasing the anion height from the Fe layer. In FeTe(Se) the anion height is believed to play a key factor for determining the superconductivity and magnetism.[28]

We further performed ESR measurements to study the magnetism of the K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} and K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4} crystals, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6. The benefit of ESR is that it can give dynamic information of the local moment and magnetic correlation. In cuprate superconductors and their parent compounds ESR has been shown to be a highly sensitive tool to study the spin fluctuations and magnetic interactions. For the iron-based superconductors ESR experiments on LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} and EuFe_{2}As_{2} have been carried out recently, which showed clear evidence for the existence of local moment and spin fluctuations.[36; 37]

Figure 5 shows the ESR spectra of the K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} sample from 2 K to 300 K for both H//c-axis and H//ab-plane. As the spectra signal at the temperature range of 40 K \sim 300 K is very weak, we multiply the intensity in this temperature range by 10. The resonance field (H_{\rm res}) is defined as the magnetic field corresponding to the midpoint between the highest and lowest points in the ESR spectrum. The effective g factor can be calculated with formula g = (h\upsilon)/(\mu_{B}H_{\rm res}). At 300 K, there is a well-defined resonance signal located at about 0.32 T (with the g factor \sim 2.083), which can be attributed to the local moment of PM-Fe ions, similar to the case of LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x}.[36] Upon cooling below 300 K, one can see that instead of increase, the intensity of the PM signal decreases for both the H//c-axis and H//ab-plane. We quantify the change of the resonance signal in the normal state between 40 K

The upper inset shows the zoom plot of resistivity around superconducting transition under external magnetic field.

  300 K by integrating the measured intensities, as shown in Fig. 7. The signal intensity drastically depresses below 140 K, and no evident resonance signal is observed at temperatures between 40 K and 60 K. With further decreasing temperature below 35 K, a diplike signal appears at low fields typical for the magnetic-shielding feature, indicating the appearance of superconductivity.

The temperature dependence of the ESR signal for the S-substituted sample K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4} is given in Fig. 6. Similar to the case in K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}, one can see a PM signal at room temperature. With cooling temperature, the spectra intensity decreases gradually and disappears around 60 K. Both in Figs. 5(a) and 6(a), besides the diplike signal corresponding to superconductivity below 35 K, a novel resonance-characteristic spectrum appears and develops with further decreasing temperature, which is unexpected in conventional superconductors. Recently, Zhang _et al_. reported that the two-magnon Raman intensity in the superconducting state (9 K) would clearly lie below that in the normal state near T_{c} (35 K).[23] Moreover, the latest neutron-diffraction results from the group of W. Bao reveal that the magnetic-order parameter shows a sharp downturn as the temperature is lowered below T_{c}.[38] All of these results suggest that the superconductivity might be in proximity to magnetism in the K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} system.

Since several less ambiguous techniques have revealed that superconductivity coexists with a large-moment AFM order in K_{0.8}Fe_{1.6}Se_{2}, it allows a direct comparison between ESR and other measurements.[21; 22; 23; 24] In particular, neutron-diffraction investigation finds that in a wide temperature range below 500 K, the intensity of the (101) magnetic Bragg peak increases linearly with decreasing temperature and seems to saturate below \sim2T_{c} (around 60 K).[22] Comparing neutron scattering with ESR, the former is sensitive to AFM order but inert to PM, however ESR does the opposite because the AFM-resonance frequency is far from the X-band. From this point of view, ESR measurement can be regarded as a supplement for neutron scattering. In Fig. 7 one can see that instead of increase, the intensity of the PM signal decreases upon cooling below 300 K, signaling the decrease of PM-Fe ions. Those disappearing PM ions might develop into an AFM state and be responsible for the strengthening of AFM order, as revealed by neutron scattering.[22] It is interesting to note that upon further cooling, the PM-resonance signal disappears close to 60 K (\sim2 T_{c}), almost equaling the saturation temperature of AFM order in neutron-diffraction study.[22]

Besides similarities, different evolution of the ESR spectrum for two components is also observed. For K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4}, the PM signal not only weakens but also shifts to lower magnetic field upon cooling below 300 K for both H/c-axis and H/ab-plane. Moreover, a resonance signal at high field (\sim0.43 T) is detected when applying magnetic field along c-axis, as shown in Fig. 6(b). The changing of the resonance field gives direct evidence for the variation of magnetism upon doping S into K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} in addition to the DC-susceptibility measurements.

In the ESR measurement the effective magnetic field H_{\text{eff}} experienced by the unpaired electrons can be written in simple form as H_{\text{eff}}=H_{\text{ext}}+H_{\text{int}}. Here H_{\text{ext}} is the applied magnetic field, and H_{\text{int}} is the local internal magnetic field. For the case H_{\text{int}}>0, the internal field may cause the resonance line to shift to lower field; on the contrary, the resonance signal would appear at higher field with negative internal magnetic

  field. Normally the resonance field, e.g., the g factor, should be temperature independent if the local internal field does not change as temperature. The strong temperature-dependent g factor caused by the change of internal magnetic field has also been observed in other iron-based superconductors. The change of internal magnetic field might arise from the magnetic fluctuation for LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{3}[36] or might result from the homogenous polarization of the conduction electrons in the external field (Pauli susceptibility) for EuFe_{2}As_{2}[37]. Since there is no strong magnetic fluctuation in K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}[39] and the electronic-transport behavior does not change significantly with S substitution, the explanations by magnetic fluctuation or Pauli susceptibility could not be applied to K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}.

For K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}, in the ideal AFM background, the net internal magnetic field suffered by the PM-Fe ions is zero, therefore the g factor almost keeps constant with decreasing temperature. For K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4}, the resonance field depends on temperature on one hand, and extra resonance signal is detected at higher field when applying field along _c_-axis on the other hand. This indicates clearly that the substitution of S for Se changes the parent AFM background and induces local internal magnetic field. Early neutron-scattering experiment has revealed that the AFM order in K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} is determined in an ordered vacancy structure with a (\sqrt{5}\times\sqrt{5}\times1) supercell.[22] The structure contains two iron sites; one is fully occupied (Fe1), while the other is almost completely empty (Fe2).[22, 40] The magnetic structure is a "block checkerboard" structure with four Fe spins near the center of the unit cell pointing down, and four spins near the corners pointing up.[22] As reported in a similar iron chalcogenide system FeTe_{1-x}Se_{x}, doping Se into Te sites could transform the magnetic ordering from the (\pi, 0) to the (\pi, \pi) by decreasing the Te-height from the Fe plane.[5, 6, 28] Analogously, replacing Se with S would also change the local environment of Fe-Se tetrahedral in K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}, as well as the occupation state in Fe1 and Fe2 sites. Therefore it is predictable that S-substitution may vary the exchange interactions between adjacent Fe ions and thereby induce local weak ferromagnetism into system. Consistent with our ESR results, recent study on K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2-z}S_{z} shows that the magnetism changes from AFM to spin glass upon doping

  S on the Se site.[32] The local weak ferromagnetism can be the source of the internal magnetic field felt by the PM ions. The decrease of the resonance field with temperature implies the enhancement of the local ferromagnetism.

The high-field resonance signal in Fig. 6(b), which arises from the PM ions in negative internal magnetic fields, is absent in Fig. 6(a) for external field perpendicular to c-axis. Since the magnetic moments of Fe ions in the AFM state are oriented along the c-axis in K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2},[22] the difference between the ESR spectra in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) reveals the intrinsic anisotropy of the magnetism for K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4}. Nevertheless, to explore detailed evolution of the magnetic structure for K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4}, further studies by other techniques (e.g., neutron diffraction) are needed.

## IV Conclusion

In summary we have studied the Se-site substitution effects on superconductivity and magnetism in the K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} system. Being contrary to external pressure effect, chemical pressure generated by the doping of S does not suppress T_{c} significantly. Detailed investigation on the evolution of ESR spectrum reveals that the PM component in system decreases with temperature and transforms into AFM phase entirely near 2 T_{c}. Sulfur substitution leads to the formation of weak ferromagnetism, which might be caused by the variation of the local Fe-Se tetrahedral structure and the decrease of the anion height from Fe-layer. The ESR results provide extra evidence for the coexistence of superconductivity with magnetism in addition to \muSR, neutron-diffraction, Raman-scattering, and Mossbauer studies.

28 January 201128 January 2  FeSe_{0.8}S_{0.2} were prepared by reacting high-purity powder of iron, selenium, and sulfur at 650 ^{\circ}C for 12 hours. Then, the synthesized powder and K pieces were put into a small quartz tube with nominal compositions of K_{0.8}Fe_{2}Se_{2} and K_{0.8}Fe_{2}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4}, respectively. The small quartz tube was sealed under high vacuum, put in a larger quartz tube, and was then followed by evacuating and being sealed. The mixture was heated up to 1050 ^{\circ}C and kept over 4 hours. Afterward the melt was cooled down to 700 ^{\circ}C with the cooling rate 6 ^{\circ}C/h before the furnace was shut down.

The obtained crystals were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray single crystal diffraction with Cu K_{\alpha} radiation at room temperature. Actual composition of the crystals was confirmed using energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectrometry. The resistivity was measured by using a standard four-probe method in a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). Magnetic properties were investigated using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. ESR measurements were performed using a Bruker EMX plus 10/12 CW-spectrometer at X-band frequencies (f\approx 9.36 GHz) equipped with a continuous He gas-flow cryostat in the temperature region of 2-300 K by sweeping magnetic field parallel to the ab-plane and c-axis.

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1 shows the single crystal and powder XRD patterns for K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4}. For both components, only (_001_) diffraction peaks appear in the single crystal XRD patterns, indicating that the c-axis is perpendicular to the cleavage surface. To examine the purity of the prepared crystals, we further performed powder XRD measurements by grinding several slides into powder for each component. All the peaks can be well indexed with the symmetry of 14/mmun, and no impurity phase is observed. The calculated-lattice parameters are a=3.9106 A, c=14.0663 A for K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} and a=3.8560 A, c=14.0344 A for K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4}, similar to previously reported values.[13, 14, 15]

Slight shrinkage of the lattice in K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4} indicates effective substitution of S for Se in the as-grown single crystals. The average stoichiometry of the as-grown samples was determined from EDX by examination of multiple points in the crystals. The measured compositions are K_{0.79}Fe_{1.64(2)}Se_{2.00} and K_{0.74}Fe_{1.67(5)}Se_{1.61}S_{0.40}. We also measured the composition mapping using EDX. The results show that the spatial distribution of K, Fe, Se and S, is homogenous.

Figure 2 presents the in-plane resistivity and susceptibility results of the parent compound K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}. At high temperature, the resistivity increases with decreasing temperature and exhibits a broad hump at about 120 K. With further cooling, metallic transport behavior is observed, followed by superconducting transition at T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset}\sim 31.3 K. The abnormal hump in the resistivity curve has also been observed in Rb_{0.8}Fe_{2}Se_{2} and Cs_{0.8}Fe_{2}Se_{2}, seemly to be a common feature in this system.[16, 17, 29] The temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility with H=10 Oe under both zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) conditions is given in the upper-right inset of Fig. 2. It shows that the superconducting shield begins to emerge at about 30.4 K. The superconducting volume fraction estimated from the ZFC magnetization at 4 K is about 92%, which indicates the bulk superconductivity nature of the crystals. The upper-left inset shows the magnetic susceptibility of K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} with the magnetic field of 1 T applied parallel to the c-axis. A sudden drop at about 30 K corresponds to the superconducting transition. The magnetic susceptibility weakly decreases with temperature below 300 K and exhibits a weak upturn below 140 K. The decrease in susceptibility with decreasing temperature at high temperatures has been correlated to the antiferromagnetism.[30, 31]

The temperature dependence of resistivity for the K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4} sample is shown in Fig. 3. The hump temperature T_{\rm H}\sim 131 K is slightly higher than that in K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}. The lower inset of Fig. 3 shows the details of the superconducting transition; the onset and zero-resistivity

The lower inset shows an enlarged view of superconducting transition from 27 K to 32 K. The ZFC and FC susceptibility taken at 10 Oe with the magnetic field parallel to the ab-plane is shown in the upper-right inset. The upper-left inset shows the magnetic susceptibility of K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} with the magnetic field of 1 T applied parallel to the c-axis.

  temperature were determined to be T_{c}^{\rm onset} = 32.8 K and T_{c}^{\rm zero} = 31.2 K, respectively. Both of them are slightly higher than those of the parent compound K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4} with that reported by Lei _et al._[32] - Resistivity as a function of temperature under the magnetic field (H = 14 T) applied in ab-plane and along c-axis is also shown in Fig. 3. The transition temperature of superconductivity is suppressed, and the transition is broadened under external magnetic field; see the upper inset of Fig. 3. An obvious difference for the effect of field along a different direction on the superconductivity indicates the existence of anisotropy in K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4} crystal. However, the hump peak in the resistivity curve has no obvious shift when applying magnetic field with no-matter H//c-axis or H//ab-plane.

Diamagnetism at low temperature in K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4} can be clearly observed in magnetization measurements with magnetic field of 100 Oe, as seen in Fig. 4. The onset temperature T_{c}^{\rm mag} of about 31 K is almost identical to the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}^{\rm zero} in resistivity measurements. The inset of Fig. 4 shows magnetic susceptibility of K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4} with the magnetic field of 1 T applied parallel to the c-axis and ab-plane from 10 K to 300 K. At low temperature, superconducting trace still exists, as revealed by the drop of susceptibility. Whether or not the external field is parallel to the c-axis, the magnetic susceptibility continually decreases with increasing the temperature from 33 K to 300 K, in disagreement with the case in parent compound K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}. The difference suggests that the magnetism is distinctly changed by the substitution of S for Se.

Since the ionic radius of S is smaller than that of Se, the substitution should produce positive chemical pressure. Recently, J. Guo _et al_. reported that both the T_{c}^{\rm onset} and T_{c}^{\rm zero} of K_{0.8}Fe_{1.7}Se_{2} decreased with increasing pressure, and superconductivity disappeared under pressure above 9.2 GPa.[33] Similar suppression of superconductivity under external pressure was also found in K_{0.85}Fe_{2}Se_{1.80} and Cs_{0.86}Fe_{1.66}Se_{2}.[34] However, Kawasaki _et al_. reported that T_{c}^{\rm onset} increases with increasing pressure, while T_{c}^{\rm zero} decreases.[35] In present work the doping with S does not decrease the transition temperature, implying that the effect of chemical pressure on superconductivity is different from that of external pressure. Considering AFe_{2}Se_{2}, the bond between the FeSe layers is via weak van der Waals force, which is fragile to external pressure. In contrast the substitution of S for Se may have more affect on modulating the bond between Fe and Se, thereby decreasing the anion height from the Fe layer. In FeTe(Se) the anion height is believed to play a key factor for determining the superconductivity and magnetism.[28]

We further performed ESR measurements to study the magnetism of the K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} and K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4} crystals, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6. The benefit of ESR is that it can give dynamic information of the local moment and magnetic correlation. In cuprate superconductors and their parent compounds ESR has been shown to be a highly sensitive tool to study the spin fluctuations and magnetic interactions. For the iron-based superconductors ESR experiments on LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} and EuFe_{2}As_{2} have been carried out recently, which showed clear evidence for the existence of local moment and spin fluctuations.[36; 37]

Figure 5 shows the ESR spectra of the K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} sample from 2 K to 300 K for both H//c-axis and H//ab-plane. As the spectra signal at the temperature range of 40 K \sim 300 K is very weak, we multiply the intensity in this temperature range by 10. The resonance field (H_{\rm res}) is defined as the magnetic field corresponding to the midpoint between the highest and lowest points in the ESR spectrum. The effective g factor can be calculated with formula g = (h\upsilon)/(\mu_{B}H_{\rm res}). At 300 K, there is a well-defined resonance signal located at about 0.32 T (with the g factor \sim 2.083), which can be attributed to the local moment of PM-Fe ions, similar to the case of LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x}.[36] Upon cooling below 300 K, one can see that instead of increase, the intensity of the PM signal decreases for both the H//c-axis and H//ab-plane. We quantify the change of the resonance signal in the normal state between 40 K

The lower inset shows an enlarged view of superconducting transition from 28 K to 34 K. The upper inset shows the zoom plot of resistivity around superconducting transition under external magnetic field.

  300 K by integrating the measured intensities, as shown in Fig. 7. The signal intensity drastically depresses below 140 K, and no evident resonance signal is observed at temperatures between 40 K and 60 K. With further decreasing temperature below 35 K, a diplike signal appears at low fields typical for the magnetic-shielding feature, indicating the appearance of superconductivity.

The temperature dependence of the ESR signal for the S-substituted sample K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4} is given in Fig. 6. Similar to the case in K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}, one can see a PM signal at room temperature. With cooling temperature, the spectra intensity decreases gradually and disappears around 60 K. Both in Figs. 5(a) and 6(a), besides the diplike signal corresponding to superconductivity below 35 K, a novel resonance-characteristic spectrum appears and develops with further decreasing temperature, which is unexpected in conventional superconductors. Recently, Zhang _et al_. reported that the two-magnon Raman intensity in the superconducting state (9 K) would clearly lie below that in the normal state near T_{c} (35 K).[23] Moreover, the latest neutron-diffraction results from the group of W. Bao reveal that the magnetic-order parameter shows a sharp downturn as the temperature is lowered below T_{c}.[38] All of these results suggest that the superconductivity might be in proximity to magnetism in the K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} system.

Since several less ambiguous techniques have revealed that superconductivity coexists with a large-moment AFM order in K_{0.8}Fe_{1.6}Se_{2}, it allows a direct comparison between ESR and other measurements.[21; 22; 23; 24] In particular, neutron-diffraction investigation finds that in a wide temperature range below 500 K, the intensity of the (101) magnetic Bragg peak increases linearly with decreasing temperature and seems to saturate below \sim2T_{c} (around 60 K).[22] Comparing neutron scattering with ESR, the former is sensitive to AFM order but inert to PM, however ESR does the opposite because the AFM-resonance frequency is far from the X-band. From this point of view, ESR measurement can be regarded as a supplement for neutron scattering. In Fig. 7 one can see that instead of increase, the intensity of the PM signal decreases upon cooling below 300 K, signaling the decrease of PM-Fe ions. Those disappearing PM ions might develop into an AFM state and be responsible for the strengthening of AFM order, as revealed by neutron scattering.[22] It is interesting to note that upon further cooling, the PM-resonance signal disappears close to 60 K (\sim2 T_{c}), almost equaling the saturation temperature of AFM order in neutron-diffraction study.[22]

Besides similarities, different evolution of the ESR spectrum for two components is also observed. For K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4}, the PM signal not only weakens but also shifts to lower magnetic field upon cooling below 300 K for both H/c-axis and H/ab-plane. Moreover, a resonance signal at high field (\sim0.43 T) is detected when applying magnetic field along c-axis, as shown in Fig. 6(b). The changing of the resonance field gives direct evidence for the variation of magnetism upon doping S into K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} in addition to the DC-susceptibility measurements.

In the ESR measurement the effective magnetic field H_{\text{eff}} experienced by the unpaired electrons can be written in simple form as H_{\text{eff}}=H_{\text{ext}}+H_{\text{int}}. Here H_{\text{ext}} is the applied magnetic field, and H_{\text{int}} is the local internal magnetic field. For the case H_{\text{int}}>0, the internal field may cause the resonance line to shift to lower field; on the contrary, the resonance signal would appear at higher field with negative internal magnetic

  field. Normally the resonance field, e.g., the g factor, should be temperature independent if the local internal field does not change as temperature. The strong temperature-dependent g factor caused by the change of internal magnetic field has also been observed in other iron-based superconductors. The change of internal magnetic field might arise from the magnetic fluctuation for LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{3}[36] or might result from the homogenous polarization of the conduction electrons in the external field (Pauli susceptibility) for EuFe_{2}As_{2}[37]. Since there is no strong magnetic fluctuation in K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}[39] and the electronic-transport behavior does not change significantly with S substitution, the explanations by magnetic fluctuation or Pauli susceptibility could not be applied to K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}.

For K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}, in the ideal AFM background, the net internal magnetic field suffered by the PM-Fe ions is zero, therefore the g factor almost keeps constant with decreasing temperature. For K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4}, the resonance field depends on temperature on one hand, and extra resonance signal is detected at higher field when applying field along _c_-axis on the other hand. This indicates clearly that the substitution of S for Se changes the parent AFM background and induces local internal magnetic field. Early neutron-scattering experiment has revealed that the AFM order in K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} is determined in an ordered vacancy structure with a (\sqrt{5}\times\sqrt{5}\times1) supercell.[22] The structure contains two iron sites; one is fully occupied (Fe1), while the other is almost completely empty (Fe2).[22, 40] The magnetic structure is a "block checkerboard" structure with four Fe spins near the center of the unit cell pointing down, and four spins near the corners pointing up.[22] As reported in a similar iron chalcogenide system FeTe_{1-x}Se_{x}, doping Se into Te sites could transform the magnetic ordering from the (\pi, 0) to the (\pi, \pi) by decreasing the Te-height from the Fe plane.[5, 6, 28] Analogously, replacing Se with S would also change the local environment of Fe-Se tetrahedral in K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}, as well as the occupation state in Fe1 and Fe2 sites. Therefore it is predictable that S-substitution may vary the exchange interactions between adjacent Fe ions and thereby induce local weak ferromagnetism into system. Consistent with our ESR results, recent study on K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2-z}S_{z} shows that the magnetism changes from AFM to spin glass upon doping

  S on the Se site.[32] The local weak ferromagnetism can be the source of the internal magnetic field felt by the PM ions. The decrease of the resonance field with temperature implies the enhancement of the local ferromagnetism.

The high-field resonance signal in Fig. 6(b), which arises from the PM ions in negative internal magnetic fields, is absent in Fig. 6(a) for external field perpendicular to c-axis. Since the magnetic moments of Fe ions in the AFM state are oriented along the c-axis in K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2},[22] the difference between the ESR spectra in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) reveals the intrinsic anisotropy of the magnetism for K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4}. Nevertheless, to explore detailed evolution of the magnetic structure for K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{1.6}S_{0.4}, further studies by other techniques (e.g., neutron diffraction) are needed.

## IV Conclusion

In summary we have studied the Se-site substitution effects on superconductivity and magnetism in the K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} system. Being contrary to external pressure effect, chemical pressure generated by the doping of S does not suppress T_{c} significantly. Detailed investigation on the evolution of ESR spectrum reveals that the PM component in system decreases with temperature and transforms into AFM phase entirely near 2 T_{c}. Sulfur substitution leads to the formation of weak ferromagnetism, which might be caused by the variation of the local Fe-Se tetrahedral structure and the decrease of the anion height from Fe-layer. The ESR results provide extra evidence for the coexistence of superconductivity with magnetism in addition to \muSR, neutron-diffraction, Raman-scattering, and Mossbauer studies.
