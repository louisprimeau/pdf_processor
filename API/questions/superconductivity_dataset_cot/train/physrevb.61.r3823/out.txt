###### Abstract

The superconducting transition temperature _T_{c}_ of vanadium has been measured up to 120 GPa by using a superconducting quantum interference device vibrating coil magnetometer. It was found that _T_{c}_ increased with pressure with a coefficient of _dT_{c}_/_dP_ = 0.1 K/GPa and at the maximum pressure onset of superconductivity reached 17.2 K, the highest _T_{c}_ among the elemental metals reported so far. Large signal to noise ratio was obtained for detecting the superconductivity of vanadium at megabar pressures in a diamond-anvil cell.

The recent development of new techniques for electric and magnetic measurements in a diamond-anvil cell (DAC) [1]-[4] enables us to increase the pressure range of investigation to very high values where the electronic states of substances change substantially from those at ambient pressure as a result of significant decrease in volume or structural changes. The subject in this pressure range focuses mainly on superconductivity especially for simple molecular solids expected to show pressure-induced superconductivity at megabar pressures [5, 6, 7]. For some transition metals, on the other hand, superconducting transition temperatures _T_{c}_'s were measured at very high pressures to compare the experimental results with theoretical prediction [2].

In this paper, we report the pressure dependence of the _T_{c}_ of vanadium up to 120 GPa. Superconductivity of the vanadium group (V, Nb, Ta) has been well studied because it shows a relatively high _T_{c}_, and for Nb _T_{c}_ = 9.25 K is the highest value among the elemental metals. Unlike Nb and Ta, V (_T_{c}_ = 5.3 K at ambient pressure) has a large positive pressure coefficient of _T_{c}_ and _T_{c}_ increases with pressure in the pressure range investigated so far. Smith's measured the _T_{c}_ of V as a function of hydrostatic pressure up to 2.4 GPa and found a linear increase in _T_{c}_ with _dT_{c}_/_dP_ = 0.062 +- 0.003 K/GPa, comparable with the theoretical values including spin-fluctuation effects. Subsequently, Brandt and Zarubina [9] observed a monotonic increase in _T_{c}_ up to 18 GPa using an ice-bomb and mechanical press. Recently, Akahama _et al._[10] made electrical resistance measurements using a Drickamer cell up to 49 GPa to investigate to what extent the monotonic increase in _T_{c}_ with pressure would hold. They found that _T_{c}_ increased linearly with a coefficient of _dT_{c}_/_dP_ = 0.096 K/GPa at pressures above 18 GPa and _T_{c}_ reached 9.6 K at their maximum pressure, which was comparable to that of Nb at ambient pressure. They interpreted such a behavior of _T_{c}_ under pressure as a result of the suppression of the fluctuations of the electron spins through the broadening of the _d_-band width. The spin fluctuation is connected with the occurrence of paramagnon, which counteracts superconductivity [11]. This fact stimulated us to carry out experiments at much higher pressures so as to establish experimentally whether such a linear increase in _T_{c}_ would still hold or if the sign of _dT_{c}_/_dP_ would change at higher pressure.

We used a small DAC of a pressure-clamp type, all parts of which were made of hardened Cu-Be alloy. Alignment and tilt adjustment mechanism for diamond anvils was not provided so as to obtain enough space for the detection coil around the anvils. Both anvils were set so that they were facing as parallel as possible by rotating and displacing the anvil on the fixed piston before the anvil was glued to it. We stamped out vanadium disks of 30 or 40 \mum in diameter as a sample from a foil of 25.4 \mum in thickness with a purity of 99.95%, which were put in a hole of Re gasket together with ruby powder for pressure determination. No pressure medium was used.

dc magnetic susceptibility _khc_ was measured by using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) vibrating coil magnetometer (VCM) (Ref. [12]) to determine the _T_{c}_ of V. Even though we deal with samples of very small sizes in a DAC, rather large signals of perfect diamagnetism due to superconductivity can be obtained when a disk-shaped sample is used and measurements are made along the axis of the disk. The signal associated with the superconducting transition is proportional to _Hv_/_2_r_(1 - _D_), where H, v, r, and D are applied magnetic field, volume of the sample, effective radius of the SQUID detection coil, and demagnetization factor of the sample, respectively [13], showing that a large enhancement of the signal occurs when the sample gets thinner and D approaches 1. The use of a SQUID VCM as a sensing device enables us to make high-sensitive magnetic measurements with good signal-to-background noise ratio for extremely small samples in a DAC. This is because the location of the detection coil of a SQUID magnetometer can be adjusted to have maximum sensitivity above the gasket where the gradient of the magnetic flux due to the sample magnetization takes a maximum value. Besides, the background signal decreases with distance from the detection coil at a higher rate than that in the case of magnetic-flux detection.

Measurements of \chi_{\rm dc} were made at temperatures above 4 K, below which the signals changed abruptly due to the superconductivity of Re used for a gasket.

Figure 1(a) shows the temperature dependence of the \chi_{\rm dc} of V at various pressures up to 112 GPa measured with increasing temperature at a magnetic field of 3 Oe after zero-field cooling, which we call run A. A small peak at around 8.5 K, which appears on all the data and the magnitude and the temperature are almost independent of pressure, may come from the Re gasket. Although there was a small increase in signals at high and low temperatures due to the background signal, clear transitions were observed in all curves. The signals at high pressures are large compared with those at ambient pressure and their magnitudes are almost independent of pressure. This is because the shape of the sample changes to a very thin disk as a result of a large plastic deformation perpendicular to the load in the initial compression. Figure 1(b) shows the result for another run, B. Although the magnitudes of the signals at ambient pressure are nearly the same for both runs, the signals at high pressures for run B increase more than about 12 times as large as those for run A, indicating a much larger enhancement of the signal occurring in run B. This may result from the difference in the amount of the ruby powder covering the sample, which changes the thickness of the sample when compressed together with the ruby powder. The value of the demagnetization factor may also be affected largely by nonuniform distribution of the ruby powder, which causes the variation of the local thickness of the sample. Detection of such large signals suggests that much reduction of the sample size, which would be needed at much higher pressure, may be possible for the measurement of T_{c} of the superconductor. As for the sharpness of the transition, the transition width for run B was about 4-5 times as large as that for run A. This indicates a larger pressure distribution in the sample for run B, which was consistent with the results of the ruby fluorescent measurement at room temperature. The inset of Fig. 1 (b) shows the expanded view around the onset of superconductivity at 120 GPa. As shown in the figure, the temperature of the onset reaches 17.2 K, the highest T_{c} among the elemental metals reported so far and comparable to that of compressed sulfur[5] in the second metallic phase at 157 GPa.

Figure 2 shows the pressure dependence of T_{c} up to 120 GPa, determined as the temperature at the midpoint of the transition. Previous results are also included in this figure. Surprisingly, T_{c} is still increasing with pressure over a very wide range of pressure and T_{c} reaches 16.5 K at 120 GPa, which is more than three times as large as that at ambient pressure. In contrast to the case of Nb where large anomalies

  in T_{c}(P) are observed at 5-6 GPa and 60 GPa, there are no abrupt changes in T_{c}(P) for V. A large and monotonous increase in T_{c} suggests the pressure effect on the spin fluctuation holding over a large compression of the lattice constant, \Delta a/a\!=\!0.122 at 120 GPa [14], or another mechanism enhancing the electron-phonon coupling working under high pressure. Recent calculations of electron-phonon coupling for the vanadium group [15], however, show a good agreement of the calculated values with those obtained by specific-heat measurements without considering paramagnon contribution. A small steplike increase could be observed in T_{c}(P) at about 60 GPa but the change is so small that a detailed measurement will be required to confirm the existence of the "step." Since there is no structural change for V up to 160 GPa (Ref. [14]) and an anomaly of T_{c} corresponds to a change in the electronic structure at the Fermi energy, such a discontinuity in T_{c}(P) may provide a clue to understanding the interplay of the parameters necessary for calculating the microscopic T_{c}. Expansion of the pressure range to higher values as well as detailed measurements will be needed to obtain more information about the behavior of T_{c}(P). Further theoretical investigations of _ab initio_ calculations of the superconducting transition temperature will also be needed for explaining such a high T_{c} .

dc magnetic susceptibility _khc_ was measured by using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) vibrating coil magnetometer (VCM) (Ref. [12]) to determine the _T_{c}_ of V. Even though we deal with samples of very small sizes in a DAC, rather large signals of perfect diamagnetism due to superconductivity can be obtained when a disk-shaped sample is used and measurements are made along the axis of the disk.

Besides, the background signal decreases with distance from the detection coil at a higher rate than that in the case of magnetic-flux detection.

Measurements of \chi_{\rm dc} were made at temperatures above 4 K, below which the signals changed abruptly due to the superconductivity of Re used for a gasket.

Figure 1(a) shows the temperature dependence of the \chi_{\rm dc} of V at various pressures up to 112 GPa measured with increasing temperature at a magnetic field of 3 Oe after zero-field cooling, which we call run A. A small peak at around 8.5 K, which appears on all the data and the magnitude and the temperature are almost independent of pressure, may come from the Re gasket. Although there was a small increase in signals at high and low temperatures due to the background signal, clear transitions were observed in all curves. The signals at high pressures are large compared with those at ambient pressure and their magnitudes are almost independent of pressure. This is because the shape of the sample changes to a very thin disk as a result of a large plastic deformation perpendicular to the load in the initial compression. Figure 1(b) shows the result for another run, B. Although the magnitudes of the signals at ambient pressure are nearly the same for both runs, the signals at high pressures for run B increase more than about 12 times as large as those for run A, indicating a much larger enhancement of the signal occurring in run B. This may result from the difference in the amount of the ruby powder covering the sample, which changes the thickness of the sample when compressed together with the ruby powder. The value of the demagnetization factor may also be affected largely by nonuniform distribution of the ruby powder, which causes the variation of the local thickness of the sample. Detection of such large signals suggests that much reduction of the sample size, which would be needed at much higher pressure, may be possible for the measurement of T_{c} of the superconductor. As for the sharpness of the transition, the transition width for run B was about 4-5 times as large as that for run A. This indicates a larger pressure distribution in the sample for run B, which was consistent with the results of the ruby fluorescent measurement at room temperature.
