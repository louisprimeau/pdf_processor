###### Abstract

Merging experimental data and _ab initio_ calculations, we report on ThPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) and UPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) as further members of germanium-based skutterudites. For ThPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) electron-phonon coupled superconductivity develops below \(T_{c}\)=4.75 K, ascribed to intrinsic features of the Pt-Ge framework where Ge-_p_ states dominate the electronic structure at the Fermi energy. Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida coupling via the Ge framework is too weak to enable magnetic ordering in nonsuperconducting UPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\).

## I Introduction

Recently we have described the formation, crystal structure, and superconducting properties of a class of skutterudite compounds \(\{\text{Sr},\text{Ba},\text{Eu}\}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) with a unique \([\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12}]\) framework.[1, 2, 3] It was shown that below about \(T_{c}\)=5 K, electron-phonon coupled superconductivity (SC) emerges for the alkaline-earth compounds, ascribed to intrinsic features of the Pt-Ge framework where Ge-_p_ states dominate the electronic structure at the Fermi energy. From density-functional theory (DFT) calculations it was inferred that although strongly localized Eu-4\(f\) states with their peak at 2 eV below the Fermi energy give rise to a local magnetic moment of 7\(\mu_{B}\) in EuPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\), the Eu-_f_ states do not hybridize and do not induce any spin polarization onto their neighbors and thus long-range magnetic order can only arise at very low temperatures below 1.7 K. As a unique class of Ge-based skutterudites was found to extend to 4\(f\)-electron systems \(\{\text{La},\text{Ce},\text{Pr},\text{Nd}\}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\),[4] the aim of the present work is a study of the phase formation and crystal structure as well as the characterization of bulk properties by means of resistivity, magnetization, specific-heat, and band-structure calculations for actinoid compounds \(\{\text{Th},\text{U}\}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\).

While, in general, Th-based systems are in a nonmagnetic 4\({}^{+}\) state, (electronic configuration 5\(f^{0}\)6\(s^{2}\)7\(p^{2}\)), thus behaving like simple systems, the ground state of U is dominated by the partial occupation of the 5\(f\) shell giving rise to a rich variety of magnetic features such as long-range magnetic order or scenarios where the Stoner criterion is just not fulfilled.[5] The latter may provoke magnetic spin fluctuations, which may be revealed from the characteristic \(T^{3}\ln T\) contribution to the heat capacity at low temperatures.

One of the key questions in the formation of Ge-based skutterudites concerns the fact whether the addition of electrons, e.g., from Th\({}^{4+}\) to the \([\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12}]\) sublattice will create stable compounds and modify the electronic density of states (DOS) to enhance SC or drive the system toward semiconducting behavior.

## II Experimental details

Alloys of \(\{\text{Th},\text{U}\}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) were prepared by argon arc melting. While ThPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) specimen was subsequently heat treated in evacuated quartz capsules at 800 \({}^{\circ}\)C for two weeks, UPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) has to be directly quenched from the melt with nominal composition U\({}_{0.8}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\). Phase purity and lattice parameters were derived from x-ray diffraction indicating single-phase conditions for ThPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) but a small amount of nonmagnetic secondary phases (Ge+PtGe\({}_{2}\)) for UPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\).

Bulk properties of these skutterudites were obtained by a number of standard techniques, details are summarized below. A superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer served for the determination of the magnetization from 2 up to 300 K in fields up to 6 T, comparing field-cooled and zero-field-cooled results. Specific-heat measurements on samples of about 1 g were performed at temperatures ranging from 1.5 up to 170 K by means of a quasiadiabatic step heating technique in external fields up to 0.2 T. The electrical resistivity was measured on bar-shaped samples using a four-probe dc method in the temperature range from 1.9 K to room temperature.

DFT was applied using the Vienna _ab initio_ simulation package (vasp) (Refs. [6] and [7]) with a relativistic spin-orbit coupling approach.[8, 9] The Brillouin zone was sampled with 5\(\times\)5\(\times\)5 Monkhorst-Pack \(\vec{k}\)-point grids. The exchange-correlation functional was treated within the generalized gradient approximation utilizing the approach of Ref. [10].

## III Results and discussion

The crystal structure of ThPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) (from Rietveld refinements) and UPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) (from Kappa-CCD single-crystal x-ray data at 300, 200, and 100 K) was found to be cubic and isotypic with the filled skutterudite-type LaFe\({}_{4}\)Sb\({}_{12}\).[11] Structure and lattice parameters are collected in Table I. Occupation factors were refined, corresponding to a full occupancy of the actinoid Pt and Ge sublattices. Although the Ge icosahedra are significantly smaller than the corresponding Sb framework and therefore effective bonding between the framework cages and the Th-center atoms is ensured, temperature-dependent single-crystal x-ray data for UPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) unambiguously defined a strong temperature dependency of  atomic displacement parameters (ADP) in the temperature region from 100 to 300 K for the smaller uranium atoms (see Fig. 1). Thus typical rattling modes caused by uranium as filler atoms are derived from the atom displacement parameters

\[U_{ii} = \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m_{U}k_{B}\theta_{E,ii}}{\rm{coth}}\left( \frac{\theta_{E,ii}}{2T} \right)\]

obtained from structure refinement at three different temperatures yielding an Einstein temperature of \(\theta_{E} = 59\) K (\(m_{U}\) is the mass of uranium). The optimized structural parameters obtained from DFT calculations are in reasonable agreement with x-ray structure data (differences of \(<\)1%).

Temperature-dependent resistivity measurements carried out on ThPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) indicate SC at \(T_{c}\) = 4.8 K [compare Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)] while results for UPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) do not exhibit SC down to 1.9 K [Fig. 2(a)]. This significant difference in the ground states of both neighboring compounds is already reflected in the temperature dependencies of the resistivity in the normal-state region. Neither of the compounds, however, show a simple metal-like resistivity behavior, i.e., the Bloch-Gruneisen formula is not applicable in any case. Such a behavior is known for many superconductors and may be attributed to a substantial electron-phonon interaction strength responsible for the formation of Cooper pairs in conventional superconductors. Rather, the overall \(\rho(T)\) dependence of ThPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) follows the phenomenological model of Woodard and Cody, [12] which initially applied to A15 superconductors such as Nb\({}_{3}\)Sn. Least-squares fits to this model are shown as solid line in Fig. 2(a), revealing reasonable agreement with a characteristic temperature \(T_{0}\) = 131 K. Similar characteristic temperatures as well as similar but slightly lower transition temperatures into the superconducting state were observed recently for isomorphous \(\{\)Sr, Ba\(\}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\). [1] The residual resistivity \(\rho_{0}\) = 3 \(\mu\Omega\) cm indicates good sample quality as well as the complete filling of the voids by Th in the skutterudite structure.

The overall \(\rho(T)\) features of UPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) turn out to be different. At low temperatures, \(\rho(T)\) behaves according to \(\rho(T)\) = \(\rho_{0}\) + \(AT^{n}\) with \(\rho_{0}\) = 14.5 \(\mu\Omega\) cm, \(A\) = 0.42 \(\mu\Omega\) cm/K\({}^{1.5}\), and \(n\) = 1.5. The latter refers to distinct deviations from a Fermi-liquid ground state due to strong spin fluctuations, which are evident also from a large value of the Sommerfeld constant \(\gamma\) = 156 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) (see below). Moreover, classical spin fluctuation systems such as YCo\({}_{2}\) exhibit--at elevated temperatures--a tendency toward saturation, which can also be conceived from Fig. 2(a) for UPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\).

The magnetic susceptibility \(\chi\) of ThPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) (see Fig. 3) is diamagnetic in the normal-state region, revealing a temperature-independent susceptibility \(\chi\) = \(-\)1.5 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-7}\) cm\({}^{3}\)/g. At \(T\) = 4.8 K the sharp transition provides evidence for SC, in perfect agreement with the resistivity data. The diamagnetic value of [\(-\)1/4 \(\pi\)] for zero-field cooling corresponds to a complete flux exclusion of the total sample volume due to the screening currents. The flux expulsion (Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect) for field cooling in 50 and 200 G is only 21% and 17% of the shielding signal, which indi

  cates a rather strong flux pinning in a type II superconductor. With growing external fields the transition is washed out and shifted to lower temperatures and is suppressed in fields larger than 0.13 T above 2.2 K.

The heat capacity \(C_{p}\) of ThPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) is plotted in Fig. 4 as \(C_{p}/T\) vs \(T\) for various fields up to 0.2 T. The jump of \(C_{p}(T)\) below 5 K evidences bulk SC. Idealizing the specific-heat anomaly under the constraint of entropy balance between the superconducting and the normal state, we arrive at \(T_{c}\) = 4.75 K. The entropy balance between the superconducting and the normal state defines \(C_{p}/T(T\)=0) = 35(1) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) and, furthermore, the heat capacity in the superconducting [dashed-dotted line in Fig. 4(a)] and in the normal state [dashed line in Fig. 4(a)] (i.e., measurements at 0 and 0.2 T, respectively), indeed yields \(\Delta S(T\)=\(T_{c})=0\). To derive these extrapolations, the phonon contribution is taken from the model sketched in Fig. 5 (see discussion below). The BCS equation \(C_{cS}(T)\)=8.5\(\gamma T_{c}\exp(-0.82\Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T)\) is applied in order to describe the electronic contribution to \(C_{p}(T)\) in the superconducting state [dashed-dotted line, Fig. 4(a)]. Here, \(\Delta(0)\) represents the superconducting gap at \(T\)= 0.

The inapplicability of a Debye-type extrapolation of \(C_{p}(T)\) toward low temperatures (as usually applied in simple metallic systems) demonstrates the existence of a complicated phonon spectrum in this compound.

For a qualitative and quantitative description of the lattice dynamics, we adapted a model comprising some fine structure in the phonon DOS \(F(\omega)\).[13, 14] Accordingly, the heat capacity is

\[C_{\mu\mu}(T)=3R\int_{0}^{\infty}F(\omega)\frac{\left(\frac{\omega}{2T}\right) ^{2}}{\sinh^{2}\left(\frac{\omega}{2T}\right)}d\omega,\] (2)

with \(\omega\) the phonon frequency and \(R\) the gas constant. The most common assumptions on \(F(\omega)\) are \(F(\omega)=\delta(\omega)\) and \(F(\omega)\sim\omega^{2}\) up to a cut-off frequency \(\omega_{D}\), corresponding to the well-known Einstein and Debye model, respectively. Junod _et al.[13]_ demonstrated that certain functionals of the phonon specific heat take the form of convolutions of the phonon spectrum. In particular, \((5/4)R\pi^{4}C_{ph}T^{-3}\) is an image of the spectrum \(\omega^{-2}F(\omega)\) for \(\omega\)= 4.93\(T\), where \(\omega\) is expressed in degrees kelvin. Based on these considerations we have constructed an elementary phonon spectrum and have carried out least-squares fits to the data. Besides a Debye DOS, we assumed that the system contains two additional energetically separated Einstein-type modes \(\omega_{1}\) and \(\omega_{2}\). In contrast to the standard Einstein model of the specific heat, a certain

The dashed line is a least-squares fit of the experimental data using the model described in the text with a Debye spectrum (\(\theta_{D}\)=260 K) and two Einstein-type modes (\(\omega_{\rm{EL},2}\) = 34.7 K with a width of 2.2 K and \(\omega_{\rm{EL},2}\) = 63.8 K with a width of 6.4 K). The solid line (referring to the right axis) describes the phonon spectral function \(F(\omega)\) plotted as \((4/5)R\pi^{4}\omega^{-2}F(\omega)\) vs \(\omega/4.93\). \(\omega\) is given in degrees kelvin.

  frequency width D_o_ for each of these branches is allowed. Results of this ansatz are shown in Fig. 5 as dashed line.

Based on this fit, the phonon spectra are constructed and plotted in Fig. 5 referring to the right axis (solid line). The spectral weight follows from the constraint that for \(T\) - 0 the height of the phonon DOS coincides with the value of _C_p/_T_3 for \(T\) - 0. The low-lying phonon branch may render those lattice vibrations which couple to the electron system, thereby enabling BCS-type SC.

Within the McMillan model,15 the superconducting transition temperature _T_c is given by

\[T_{c} = \frac{\theta_{D}}{1.45}\exp\left[ \frac{- 1.04(1 + \lambda)}{\lambda - \mu_{c}^{*}(1 + 0.62\lambda)} \right\rbrack,\]

where l is the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling constant related in terms of the Eliashberg theory to the phonon DOS. l determines the attractive part of the Cooper pair bonding while _m_* is the repulsive screened Coulomb part, usually set to =0.13. Applying this simple model yields l =0.66, referring to superconductors beyond the weak-coupling limit.

Taking the jump of the specific heat D_C_p/_T_(_T_=_T_c) = 61(2) mJ/mol K2, D_C_p/_(_g__T_c) is calculated to be 1.75, which is above the value expected from the BCS theory [D_C_p/_(_g__T_c) = 1.43]. As the magnetic-field strength increases, both the transition temperature and the anomaly right at _T_c are suppressed, defining the phase diagram shown in Fig. 4(b).

The superconducting gap D(0) of ThPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) can be estimated from the modified BCS expression _C__eq(T)_ = 8.5_g__T_c exp[-0.82D(0)/_k_B_T_]. Adjusting this model expression to our specific-heat data at lowest temperatures, _C__eq(T)_ = _C__p(T)_ - _C__ph(T)_ reveals D = 0.72(1) meV. The ratio D(0)/_k__B_T_c = 1.8 is in fine agreement with the BCS value D\({}_{\text{BCS}}\)(0) = 1.76_k__B_T_c.

The thermodynamic critical field is calculated from the free-energy difference between the superconducting and normal state: D_F_(_T_) = \(F_{n}\) - \(F_{s}\) = _m__0H_c(_T_)/2 = _T__T  subtraction of \(C_{p}(T)\) of isomorphous nonmagnetic ThPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) fails since the \(C_{p}^{p}\) functions intersect each other, i.e., \(C_{p}(T)\) of nonmagnetic ThPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) summutations that of UPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) for \(T\)\(>\) 12 K [see Fig. 6(b)], referring to differences in the phonon spectrum. The observation of such a crossover is not a unique feature of the {U,Th}Pt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) systems but frequently occurs in isostructural pairs of {La, Ce} or complementary {Yb, LU} compounds. In all these cases, common explanations such as mass or volume differences do not apply, indicating rather a magnetic origin.

Although the phonon spectra of both compounds are more complex than that of a simple Debye solid, we attempted to fit the low-temperature data of UPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) with the ansatz \(C_{p}(T)\) = \(\gamma T\)+ \(\beta T^{3}\)+ \(\delta T^{3}\) ln(\(T\)/\(T^{*}\)), where the latter term accounts for spin fluctuations. Satisfactory agreement is found for \(\gamma\)=156 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) and \(T^{*}\)= 2.7 K [solid line, inset Fig. 6(a)], suggesting spin fluctuations in the nearly localized regime. The sizable value of \(\gamma\) in combination with the \(\delta T^{3}\) ln(\(T\)/\(T^{*}\)) term, however, prevents to reliably derive \(\beta\) and thus the Debye temperature \(\theta_{D}\).

Albeit the combination of lattice and magnetic contributions does not allow a detailed analysis of lattice dynamics in UPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\). It should be noted that from temperature-dependent ADP parameters an Einstein mode for the U atoms was found at \(\theta_{E}\)=59 K, in close analogy to the phonon spectrum derived from the specific-heat analysis of ThPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\).

The calculated DOS, shown in Figs. 7(a) and 7(b), reveals the individual contributions of the Th, Pt, and Ge atoms, of which germanium \(p\)- and \(s\)-like states dominate the features of the DOS at \(E_{F}\). The relativistic effect of spin-orbit coupling does not significantly influence the DOS at \(E_{F}\). The directed covalent bonds of Ge intermixed with the more metal-like charge distribution of Pt states contribute to the peak of the DOS at \(E_{F}\). From Bader's charge analysis,[21] about 0.13 electrons are transferred from each Ge to Pt, indicating only weakly ionic Pt-Ge bonds.

The total DOS at \(E_{F}\) can be compared with the Sommerfeld value of the specific heat \(\gamma\)=\(\frac{1}{3}\)\(\pi^{2}N(E_{F})k_{B}^{2}\). The experimental values of about 35 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) for ThPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) along with an electron-phonon enhancement factor \(\lambda_{\rm qp}\)=0.66 (estimated via the McMillan formula[15]) would require a bare DOS equivalent of \(\approx\)21 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\), which compares favorably with the DOS calculation involving spin-orbit coupling; 22.7 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) and \(N(E_{F})\)= 9.63 states eV\({}^{-1}\) f. u\({}^{-1}\). Without spin-orbit coupling, \(\gamma\)=20.1 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\), documenting the insignificance of relativistic effects.

For UPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\), however, the DFT calculations (not shown here) do not disclose any magnetic ordering, thereby confirming experimental observations. The total DOS at \(E_{F}\) of 16.21 states eV\({}^{-1}\) f. u\({}^{-1}\) is significantly larger than that of ThPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\). The corresponding Sommerfeld value \(\gamma\) =38.2 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) turns out to be smaller than the experimental value of 156 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) pointing toward the pronounced effect of spin fluctuations.

## IV Summary

The {Th,U}Pt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) compounds are further representatives of family of skutterudites with a [Pt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\)] sublattice. Resistivity, magnetic-susceptibility and specific-heat measurements indicate a phonon-mediated superconducting state in ThPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) below \(T_{c}\)=4.75 K.

Superconducting properties of ThPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) have been analyzed in detail [\(\mu_{0}H_{c2}\)(0)=0.21 T, \(\xi_{0}\)=4\(\times\)10\({}^{-8}\) m, \(\lambda\)(0) =1.2\(\times\)10\({}^{-7}\)], characterizing ThPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) as a type II superconductor in the proximity of the clean limit. UPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) is dominated by spin fluctuations at low temperatures, preventing magnetic order and SC. DFT calculations proved the hybridization between Ge 4\(p\)-like and Pt 5\(d\)-like states in an energy

The graphs clearly demonstrate the very dominant character of Ge states particularly at Fermi energy. These states are of expressed \(p\)-like character. The relativistic effect is small.

  region around the Fermi level, dominating the DOS at \(E_{F}\). Consequently, SC arises primarily from the electronic [Pt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\)] sublattice states while Th (and U) plays a key role to electronically stabilize these skutterudites.

During revision of the paper we learned that SC in ThPt\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{12}\) was recently also discovered by Kaczorowski and Tran.[22]
