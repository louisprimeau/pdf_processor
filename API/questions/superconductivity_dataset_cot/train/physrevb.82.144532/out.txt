###### Abstract

Single crystals of superconducting OsB_{2} [T_{\rm c}=2.10(5) K] have been grown using a Cu-B eutectic flux. We confirm that OsB_{2} crystallizes in the reported orthorhombic structure (space group _Pmmm_) at room temperature. Both the normal and superconducting state properties of the crystals are studied using various techniques. Heat capacity versus temperature C(T) measurements yield the normal state electronic specific heat coefficient \gamma=1.95(1) mJ/mol K^{2} and the Debye temperature \Theta_{\rm D}=539(2) K. The measured frequencies of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are in good agreement with those predicted by band structure calculations. Magnetic susceptibility \chi(T,H), electrical resistivity \rho(T), and C(T,H) measurements (H is the magnetic field) demonstrate that OsB_{2} is a bulk low-\kappa [\kappa(T_{\rm c})=2(1)] type-II superconductor that is intermediate between the clean and dirty limits [\xi(T=0)/\ell=0.97]) with a small upper critical magnetic field H_{\rm c2}(T=0)=186(4) Oe. The penetration depth is \lambda(T=0).300 \mum. An anomalous (not single-gap BCS) T dependence of \lambda was fitted by a two-gap model with \lambda_{1}(T=0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=1.9 and \lambda_{2}(T=0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=1.25, respectively. The discontinuity in the heat capacity at T_{\rm c}, \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c}=1.32, is smaller than the weak-coupling BCS value of 1.43, consistent with the two-gap nature of the superconductivity in OsB_{2}. An anomalous increase in \Delta C at T_{\rm c} of unknown origin is found in finite H; e.g., \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c} = 2.5 for H \approx 25 Oe.

## I Introduction

Although multigap superconductivity was first addressed theoretically by Suhl _et al._ in 1959,[1] and the first experimental observation of the possible existence of two distinct superconducting gaps was made in 1980 using tunneling measurements on Nb-doped SrTiO_{3},[2] the subject of multigap superconductivity has only recently gained impetus after it was established that several unusual superconducting properties of MgB_{2} could be explained within a two-gap superconductivity scenario.[3, 4] There are now several other candidates for multigap superconductivity such as NbSe_{2} (Ref. [5]), RNi_{2}B_{2}C (R=Lu and Y) (Ref. [6]), Lu_{2}Fe_{2}Si_{5} (Refs. [7 and 8]), and Sr_{2}RuO_{4}.[9]

In multigap superconductors, distinct superconducting gaps exist on different disconnected parts (sheets) of the Fermi surface (FS) although the interband pairing leads to a single critical temperature T_{\rm c}.[10, 11] Most superconductors show multiband conduction but due to interband pairing, the gap has the same magnitude on all bands. When interband pairing is weak then the gaps on different sheets of the FS can have significantly different magnitudes. This can lead to anomalous behavior in the temperature-dependent heat capacity, upper critical magnetic field H_{\rm c2}, and penetration depth \lambda measurements.[3, 6, 11, 12]

The compound OsB_{2} has a layered crystal structure qualitatively similar to that of MgB_{2}, except that the B layers are corrugated in OsB_{2} instead of flat as in MgB_{2}.[13] The crystal structure of OsB_{2} is shown in Fig. 1. Figure 1(a) shows the crystal structure of OsB_{2} viewed at a slight angle from the b axis. Figure 1(b) shows the structure projected on the ab plane. Along the c axis, the boron layers lie between two planar transition metal layers which are offset along the ab plane. We have recently reported[14] several anomalous behaviors for polycrystalline samples of the layered superconductor OsB_{2} which has a superconducting transition temperature T_{\rm c}=2.1 K.[15] These unusual behaviors include a reduced specific heat discontinuity at T_{\rm c} in some samples and a magnetic field penetration depth versus temperature T dependence that was consistent with two-gap superconductivity. We also observed a positive curvature in the T dependence of the upper critical magnetic field H_{\rm c2}. To gain further insights into these interesting behaviors, measurements on single crystals are needed.

 Herein we report the growth of OsB2 single crystals, and structure, isothermal magnetization, dynamic and static magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, electrical resistivity, magnetic field penetration depth, and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillation measurements on the crystals to characterize their superconducting and normal state properties. Following a description of the experimental details in Sec. II, the experimental results are given in Sec. III. A summary of the results and our conclusions are given in Sec. IV, including a list in Table 4 summarizing the parameters characterizing the physical properties that we obtained.

## II Experimental details

Single crystals of OsB2 were grown with a high-temperature solution growth method using Cu-B as the flux. First, a polycrystalline sample of OsB2 was prepared by arc-melting Os powder (99.95%, Alfa Aesar) and B chunks (99.5%, Alfa Aesar) taken in stoichiometric ratio. A Cu-B binary alloy was then prepared at the eutectic composition Cu0.83B0.13 by arc-melting. For crystal growth the arc-melted OsB2 sample (~0.5 g) was placed in a 2 mL Al2O3 crucible. About 5 g Cu-B flux was placed on top of the OsB2 ingot. The crucible with a lid was placed in a vertical tube furnace which was then evacuated and purged with high-purity Ar gas repeatedly (~10 times) after which the growth was started in a flow (~60 cc/min) of Ar. The furnace was heated to 800 degC in 30 min, then heated to 1450 degC in 6 h and held at this temperature for 6 h. The furnace was then cooled to 1020 degC at a rate of 2 degC/h and then rapidly cooled to room temperature. Well-formed crystals with flat facets were obtained after the Cu-B flux had been dissolved in dilute nitric (HNO3) acid. A scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of a typical crystal is shown in Fig. 2(a).

Some single crystals were crushed for powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The XRD patterns were obtained using a Rigaku Geigerflex diffractometer with Cu _K_a radiation, in the 2 _th_ range from 10deg to 90deg with a 0.02deg step size. Intensity data were accumulated for 5 s per step.

For single-crystal structure determination, a well-shaped crystal (0.27 x 0.18 x 0.15 mm3) was selected. The data collection for the crystal was performed using a Bruker Apex II instrument with Cu _K_a radiation at T = 100 K and was solved with the latest version of the APEX software package which is reliable for a combination of numerical and multi-scan absorption correction. The initial cell constants were obtained from three series of o scans at different starting angles. Each series consisted of 30 frames collected at intervals of 0.3deg in a 10deg range about o with the exposure time of 5 s per frame. The obtained reflections were successfully indexed by an automated indexing routine built in the APEX program. The final cell constants were calculated from a set of strong reflections from the actual data collection. The data were collected using the full sphere routine by collecting 20 sets of frames with 1deg scans in o with an exposure time of 5 s per frame. This data set was corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. The absorption correction was a combination of a numerical one based on a face indexing and an additional correction based on fitting a function to the empirical transmission surface as sampled by multiple equivalent measurements [16] using the APEX software. [17]

Elemental analysis was done on several (~6) single crystals using energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) using an SEM. The EDS scans showed the presence of only the desired elements Os and B in the single crystals. There was no evidence of Cu in any of the crystals indicating that the flux is not incorporated in the crystals. Reliable quantitative estimates of the relative amounts of Os and B in the crystals could not be done due to the small atomic number of boron.

The temperature dependences of the dc magnetic susceptibility and isothermal magnetization were measured using a commercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetic property measurement system (MPMS5, Quantum Design). The resistivity and heat capacity were measured using a commercial physical property measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design). The resistivity was measured using a four-probe technique with a current of 5 mA along the b axis. The dynamic susceptibility was measured between 0.5 and 2.6 K using a 10 MHz tunnel-diode-driven oscillator (TDO) circuit with a volume susceptibility sensitivity D_x_ = 10-8. [18] The details of the measurement and the extraction of magnetic susceptibility and penetration depth from TDO measurements have been described in our previous work. [14]

## III Results

### Crystal structure of OsB2

The powder XRD pattern for crushed single crystals of OsB2 is shown in Fig. 2(b). With the exception of some very weak peaks of unknown origin, the lines in the x-ray pattern could be indexed to the known orthorhombic _Pmmn_ (No. 59) structure and a Rietveld refinement [19] of the x-ray pattern, shown in Fig. 2(b), gave the lattice parameters a = 4.6855(6) A, b = 2.8730(3) A, and c = 4.0778(4) A. These values are in very good agreement with our previously reported values [_a_ = 4.6851(6) A, b = 2.8734(4) A, and c = 4.0771(5) A] for a polycrystalline sample. [14]

Single-crystal XRD data were obtained at T = 100 K. The systematic extinctions of peaks in the XRD data were consistent with the space group _Pmmn_, [17] in agreement with earlier reports from single-crystal and powder XRD measurements on OsB2. [20] The positions of the atoms were found by direct methods and were refined in full-matrix anisotropic approximation. Some parameters obtained from the single-crystal structure refinement are given in Table 1 and the final atomic positions and anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs) and isotropic displacement parameters (IDPs) are given in Table 2. For boron, the obtained ADPs had large errors most likely due to the small mass of boron compared to osmium. Therefore, only the IDP for boron is reported in Table 1 along with the IDP for osmium. The R factors were the same when the ADP or IDP for boron were allowed to vary indicating that the refinement for this parameter did not influence the fit very much.

### Electrical resistivity

The electrical resistivity r versus T of a single crystal of OsB2 from 1.75 to 300 K measured in zero applied magnetic field H and with a current I = 5 mA applied along the b axis, is shown in Fig. 3. The _r_(_T_) shows metallic behavior with an approximately linear decrease in resistivity on cooling from room temperature to 50 K. This behavior is similar to that observed earlier for a polycrystalline sample. [14] At low temperatures, r becomes only weakly temperature dependent and reaches a residual resistivity r0 = 1.55 _m_tO cm just above 2.2 K as seen in the inset of Fig. 3. The large residual resistivity ratio _RRR_ = _r_(300 K)/_r_0 = 22 indicates a well-crystallized sample.

The inset of Fig. 3 shows the low-_T_ data measured in various H. The r in H = 0 drops abruptly below 2.20 K and reaches zero by 2.14 K, as highlighted in the inset of Fig. 3. This superconducting transition was observed earlier by us

The inset shows the _ρ_(_T_) data between T = 1.7 and 2.6 K measured in various applied magnetic fields H as indicated.

 for a polycrystalline sample,[14] consistent with the original report in 1975 of superconductivity in OsB_{2} by Vandenberg _et al.[15]_ As expected, the superconducting transition shifts to lower T with increasing H. These data were used to determine the upper critical magnetic field H_{\rm c2}(T) which will be discussed later. In particular, for each applied field H, this H is taken to be H_{\rm c2} for the temperature at which the resistance drops to zero.

### Isothermal magnetization and magnetic susceptibility

#### 1.3.1 Normal state

The isothermal magnetization M versus H applied along the b axis is shown in Fig. 4(a) at various T. At high T> 100 K, M is diamagnetic and proportional to H with a slope that is almost constant between T = 100 and T = 300 K. At lower T, M initially increases with H toward a positive value before showing saturation at a field of about 500 Oe. For higher H, M turns over and becomes diamagnetic. For H> 1 T, M is linear in H with a nonzero y-intercept. A similar M(H) behavior is also observed in measurements with H applied along the a and c axes and is consistent with the presence of a small amount of paramagnetic and/or ferromagnetic impurities in the sample. Contributions from paramagnetic impurities are also observed at low temperatures in our normal state magnetic susceptibility \chi measurements via a Curie-Weiss-type upturn in Fig. 5 below. The M(H) data indicate that the impurity contribution saturates at high H. We extract the saturation magnetization M_{\rm S}(T) by fitting the M(H,T) data above H = 2 T by the expression M(H,T) = M_{\rm S}(T) + \chi_{\rm int}H, where \chi_{\rm int} is the intrinsic susceptibility. The M_{\rm S}(T) data so obtained are shown in Fig. 4(b).

The normal state \chi = M/H versus T for OsB_{2}, measured between 1.8 and 300 K with H = 3 T applied along the a, b, and  Figure 5 also shows the intrinsic susceptibility \chi_{\rm int}(T) obtained by correcting the powder-averaged susceptibility for the presence of ferromagnetic and/or paramagnetic impurities as discussed above. Here we have assumed that M_{\rm S}(T) is isotropic so that we can use the M_{\rm S}(T) data obtained from M(H,T) data for the b axis to correct the powder-averaged susceptibility.

The \chi along different crystallographic directions is anisotropic with the value (averaged between T=100 and 300 K) along the b axis (\approx-6.25 x 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol) being much smaller than the susceptibility along the a (\approx-3.75 x 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol) or c (\approx-3.25 x 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol) axes which are quite similar. The similarity of the \chi values along the a and c axes is surprising given the layered nature of the crystal structure which is built up of alternating Os and B layers in the ab plane that are stacked along the c axis. However, theoretical FS calculations have shown that there are quasi-one-dimensional tubular structures running along the b axis, and the FSs along the a and c axes are quite similar.[21]

As described in Ref. [14], one can estimate the paramagnetic Pauli spin susceptibility \chi_{\rm P} from the intrinsic susceptibility \chi_{\rm int} according to

\[\chi_{\rm int}=\chi_{\rm orb}+\chi_{\rm P},\] (1)

where \chi_{\rm orb} is the total orbital susceptibility, which includes the diamagnetic core contribution, the paramagnetic Van Vleck contribution, and the Landau diamagnetic contribution from the conduction electrons. In Ref. [14], we estimated \chi_{\rm orb}=-7.8 x 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol. However, the accuracy of this estimate for \chi_{\rm orb} is unknown (see also below). Using this value of \chi_{\rm orb}, our measured \bar{\chi}_{\rm int}(300 K) =-4.50 x 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol and Eq. (1), for our single-crystalline OsB_{2} we obtain a powder average \chi_{\rm P}=3.23 x 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol.

From \chi_{\rm P}, one can estimate the density of states at the Fermi level N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) for both spin directions using the relation[22]

\[\chi_{\rm P}=\mu_{\rm B}^{2}N(\epsilon_{\rm F})=\left(3.233\times 10^{-5}\quad \frac{\rm cm^{3}}{\rm mol}\right)N(\epsilon_{\rm F}),\] (2)

where \mu_{\rm B} is the Bohr magneton and the equality on the far right-hand side is for N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) in units of states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions, where "f.u." means "formula unit." Taking the above average value of \chi_{\rm P} for OsB_{2}, we get N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) = 1.00(3) states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions. This value is a factor of 2 larger than the value from our specific-heat measurements below as well as from band-structure calculations [N(\epsilon_{\rm F})=0.55 states/(eV f.u.)].[23] indicating that our estimate of the orbital susceptibility above is too negative. Using Eq. (2) and the band-structure density of states value gives the revised estimate \chi_{\rm P}= 1.8 x 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol. Then using the measured \bar{\chi}_{\rm int}(300 K) and Eq. (1) yields a revised powder-averaged orbital susceptibility \chi_{\rm orb}=-6.3 \times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol.

#### iii.2.2 Superconducting state

The temperature dependence of the anisotropic zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) dimensionless dc volume magnetic susceptibility \chi_{\rm v} of a single crystal of OsB_{2} measured from 1.7 to 2.5 K is plotted in Figs. 6(a)-6(c) in a field of 5 Oe parallel to the a, b, and c axes, respectively, where \chi_{\rm v}=M_{\rm v}/H and M_{\rm v} is the volume magnetization. Complete diamagnetism in the absence of demagnetization effects corresponds to \chi_{\rm v}=-1/4 \pi so the data have been normalized by 1/4 \pi. A sharp diamagnetic drop in the susceptibility along all three directions, below T_{\rm c}=2.05 K, signals the transition into the superconducting state. The large Meissner fraction seen in the FC data for all three directions indicates weak magnetic flux pinning in the crystal. The data have not been corrected for the demagnetization factors N_{\alpha} (\alpha =a,b,c) which give -4 \pi\chi_{\rm v}=\frac{1}{1-\chi_{\rm v}} for the respective measured value. From the ZFC data at the lowest temperatures in Fig. 6, one obtains N_{a}=0.60, N_{b}=0.60, and N_{c}=0.65, yielding N_{a}+N_{b}+N_{c}=1.85. This sum is greater than the value of unity expected for an ellipsoid of revolution. The reason for this discrepancy is not known.

In Fig. 6(d), the temperature dependences of \chi_{\rm v} measured with various H applied along the b axis are shown. As expected the superconducting transition is suppressed to lower temperatures with increasing H. From these \chi_{\rm v}(H) data, the critical field H_{\rm c2}(T) has been estimated using the construction in Fig. 6(d), illustrated for H=5 Oe. The H_{\rm c2}(T) has been determined by fitting a straight line to the data for a given field in the superconducting state just below T_{\rm c} and to the data in the normal state above T_{\rm c} and taking the temperature at which these lines intersect as the T_{\rm c} at that H.

The hysteretic volume magnetization M_{\rm v} normalized by 1/4 \pi versus H loops measured at T=1.7 K with H applied along the a, b, and c axes are shown in Figs. 7(a)-7(c), respectively. There is a large reversible part in all the M_{\rm v} data recorded with increasing and decreasing H which again indicates very weak magnetic flux pinning in the material. The M_{\rm v}(H) data recorded at various fixed T with H applied along the b axis are shown in Fig. 7(d). Similar data (not shown)

(d) The T dependence of the ZFC superconducting volume fraction 4 \pi\chi_{\rm v} of a single crystal of OsB_{2} measured in various magnetic fields H applied along the b axis. The construction used to determine T_{\rm c}(H) is illustrated by the red straight line for H=5 Oe. At low T, the 4 \pi\chi_{\rm v} values are all more negative than -1 due to demagnetization effects.

  with H along the a and c axes were also recorded. The initial slope of the _M_v(_H_) curves is larger than the value -1 expected for perfect diamagnetism, which indicates a nonzero demagnetization factor, consistent with the 4 _p_x_v(_T_) data in Fig. 6. From the _M_v(_H_) curves in Fig. 7(d), we estimated the critical field _H_c2(_T_) from the construction illustrated in Fig. 7(d) for T = 1.75 K.

The dynamic ac susceptibility _kh_(_T_) measured between 0.6 and 2.5 K at a frequency of 10 MHz in various H is shown in Fig. 8. To determine _H_c2(_T_) from the data in Fig. 8, we fitted a straight line to the data in the normal state and to the data just below _T_c or a given applied magnetic field and took the value of the T at which these lines intersect as the _T_c(_H_). This construction is shown in Fig. 8 for the data at H = 0. By inverting _T_c(_H_), we obtain _H_c2(_T_). The _H_c2 has also been obtained in a similar way from the _kh_(_T_) = _M_(_T_)/_H_ SQUID magnetometer data (not shown here) between 1.7 and 2.4 K in various applied magnetic fields.

### Heat capacity

Figure 9 shows the heat capacity C versus T data measured on a single crystal of OsB2. The main panel shows the _C_(_T_) data measured in H = 0 between T = 1.75 and 48 K. The data below T = 10 K could be fitted by the expression _C_/_T_ = _g_T_2 where the first term is the contribution from the conduction electrons and the second term is the contribution from the lattice. The fit (not shown) gave the values g = 1.95(1) mJ/mol K2 and b = 0.0372(3) mJ/mol K4. From the value of b, one can estimate the Debye temperature _th_D using the expression22

\[\Theta_{\text{D}} = \left( \frac{12\pi^{4}Rn}{5\beta} \right)^{1/3} = \left[ (1.944 \times 10^{6}\frac{n}{\beta} \right\rbrack^{1/3},\]

where R is the molar gas constant, n is the number of atoms per formula unit (_n_ = 3 for OsB2), and the equality on the far right-hand side is for _th_D in K and b in mJ/mol K4. We obtain _th_D = 539(2) K for OsB2. The values of g, b, and _th_D obtained above are in very good agreement with the values we reported previously for an unannealed polycrystalline sample.14

The _C_(_T_) data below T = 3 K measured in 0 and 1 kOe applied field are shown in inset (a) of Fig. 9. A sharp steplike anomaly at T = 2.1 K is observed in the H = 0 Oe data and confirms the bulk nature of the superconductivity in single-crystal OsB2. The anomaly is suppressed to below T = 1.75 K in a field of H = 1 kOe. The inset (b) shows the H = 0 Oe heat capacity plotted as _C_(_T_)/_T_ versus T between T = 1.75 and 2.5 K. The jump in the specific heat D_C_ at the

The 4_π_X_ data have been normalized to a minimum value of −1 at the lowest T. The construction used to determine _T_c(_H_) is shown by the red line for H = 0.

The construction used to determine _H_c2(_T_) is shown by the solid red line for T = 1.75 K.

Figure 9: (Color online) Heat capacity C versus temperature T of a single crystal of OsB2 between 1.75 and 48 K measured in zero magnetic field H. Inset (a) shows the _C_(_T_) data between 1.75 and 3 K measured with H = 0 and H = 1 kOe applied along the c axis. Inset (b) shows the data for H = 0 plotted as _C_(_T_)/_T_ versus T between T = 1.75 and 2.5 K. The solid curve in inset (b) is a construction to estimate the heat capacity jump D_C_ at _T_c.

  superconducting transition _T_c is usually normalized as \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c}. From the construction shown as the solid curve through the data in Fig. 9 inset (b), we obtain \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c} =1.32. This value is smaller than the weak-coupling BCS value 1.43.24 Considering the sharp anomaly observed at _T_c it is unlikely that the smaller value of \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c} arises from a distribution of _T_c's due to inhomogeneities in the sample. We suggest that the small value of \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c} arises from the multigap nature of the superconductivity as evidenced from our penetration depth measurements discussed later.

The electron-phonon coupling constant \uplambda_{\rm ep} can be estimated in the single-gap superconductivity approximation using McMillan's formula [25] which relates the superconducting transition temperature _T_c to \uplambda_{\rm ep}, the Debye temperature \Theta_{\rm D}, and the Coulomb repulsion constant \mu^{*},

\[T_{\rm c} = \frac{\Theta_{\rm D}}{1.45}\exp\left[ { - \frac{1.04(1 + \uplambda_{\rm ep})}{\uplambda_{\rm ep} - \mu^{*}(1 + 0.62\uplambda_{\rm ep})}} \right\rbrack,\]

which can be inverted to give \uplambda_{\rm ep} in terms of _T_c, \Theta_{\rm D}, and \mu^{*} as

\[\uplambda_{\rm ep} = \frac{1.04 + \mu^{*}\ln\left( \frac{\Theta_{\rm D}}{1.45T_{\rm c}} \right)}{(1 - 0.62\mu^{*})\ln\left( \frac{\Theta_{\rm D}}{1.45T_{\rm c}} \right) - 1.04}.\]

From the value \Theta_{\rm D}=539 K obtained above from heat-capacity measurements, and using _T_c =2.1 K we get \uplambda_{\rm ep} =0.41 and 0.50 for \mu^{*}=0.10 and 0.15, respectively. These values of \uplambda_{\rm ep} are similar to those found for polycrystalline samples and suggest that OsB2 is a moderate-coupling superconductor.14

The density of states at the Fermi energy _N_(\epsilon_{\rm F}) for both spin directions can be estimated from the values of \gamma and \uplambda_{\rm ep} using the relation [22]

\[\gamma = \gamma_{0}(1 + \uplambda_{\rm ep}),\]

where

\[\gamma_{0} = \frac{\pi^{2}k_{\rm B}^{2}}{3}N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) = 2.359\,\,\,N(\epsilon_{\rm F}),\]

k_{\rm B} is Boltzmann's constant and the equality on the right-hand side of Eq. (7) is for \gamma_{0} in mJ/mol K2 and _N_(\epsilon_{\rm F}) in states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions. Using the above \gamma=1.95 mJ/(mol K2), we find _N_(\epsilon_{\rm F})=0.59 and 0.55 states/(eV f.u.) for the above \uplambda_{\rm ep}=0.41 and 0.50, respectively. These values are in excellent agreement with the value from band-structure calculations [_N_(\epsilon_{\rm F}) =0.55 states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions].23 This agreement indicates that OsB2 is a weakly correlated electron system, consistent with the observed diamagnetic susceptibility in Fig. 5 above. Henceforth we will take the bare density of states to be

\[N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) = 0.55\,\,\,\,{\rm states/(eV\,\,f.u.)}\]

for both spin directions, which corresponds to \mu^{*}=0.15 and \uplambda_{\rm ep}=0.50.

To obtain the critical magnetic field versus temperature we have measured _C_(_T_) in various H. Figure 10(a) shows the _C_(_T_)/_T_ versus T data between T = 0.3 and 2.5 K, measured in various applied magnetic fields H_{a}. A remanent field of about 25 Oe was present in addition to the applied magnetic field H_{a} in these measurements. For comparison, the true H =0 Oe data from Fig. 9 inset (b) are also shown. The superconducting transition seen as an abrupt jump in _C_(_T_)/_T_ is suppressed to lower T with increasing H_{a} as expected. However, the magnitude D_C_/_T_c of the anomaly at _T_c is initially larger than that observed in zero magnetic field. As shown by the arrows in Fig. 10(a), D_C_/_T_c increases from 1.32 for H = 0 Oe to 2.45 for _H__a_= 0 Oe (which is close to H = 25 Oe) suggesting a divergent nature of C at _T_c in an applied magnetic field.

Figure 10: (Color online) (a) Heat capacity C divided by temperature T versus T of a single crystal of OsB2 in various applied magnetic fields H_{a}. A remanent magnetic field H_{a} \approx 25 Oe was present over the nominal value of the applied field H_{a} listed in the figure legend. The true H =0 Oe data from Fig. 9 inset (b) are also included for comparison. (b) _C_/_T_ versus T2 measured in various true magnetic fields H for a different OsB2 crystal.

  The superconducting anomaly moves to lower T with increasing H and is not observed above _Ha_ = 100 Oe (_H_ = 125 Oe). The step in all data at about T = 1.15 K arises from a problem in the measurement and is not intrinsic to the sample.

To further study the enhanced D_C_ anomaly in low fields we measured _C_(_T_) for another single crystal in various (true) H. The data are plotted as _C_(_T_)/_T_ versus T2 in Fig. 10(b). We again observe that the anomaly at the superconducting transition becomes first-orderlike in a finite field showing that this feature is intrinsic to single-crystalline OsB2.

This DC(_H_) behavior is similar to that recently observed for T2Ga9 (_T_ = Rh and Ir),[26, 27] and for single crystals of ZrB12,[28] where it was suggested that the type-I superconductivity in these materials led to the superconducting transition in a finite magnetic field to be first-orderlike, resulting in a divergent DC(_H_) at _T_c. A similar divergent DC(_H_) at _T_c was observed 75 years ago for the type-I superconductor thallium.[29] The _C_(_T_,_H_) behavior observed for single-crystal OsB2 in Figs. 10(a) and 10(b) is similar to that observed for the materials mentioned above and might suggest that OsB2 is a type-I superconductor. However, our estimates of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter k = 2(1) below indicate that OsB2 is a small-_k_ type-II superconductor. The unusual features in the _C_(_T_,_H_) for OsB2 are therefore not understood at present but might be related to the multigap nature of the superconductivity.

### Upper critical magnetic field _H_c2(_T_)

The _H_c2(_T_) data obtained from all of the above measurements are plotted in Fig. 11. In the temperature range of the SQUID magnetometer measurements (1.7-2.4 K), all the data match well and the temperature dependence of _H_c2 is linear (solid curve extrapolated to T = 0 K in Fig. 11) with the slope \frac{d\Pi}{dT} = -125 Oe/K. This linear slope can be used to get an estimate of the T = 0 K upper critical field using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula for the clean limit H_{\text{c2}}(0) = - 0.693T_{\text{c}}\frac{d\Pi}{dT}|_{\text{c}}.[30] Using the above value of \frac{d\Pi}{dT}|_{\text{c}} = -125 Oe/K and _T_c = 2.10 K, we get _H_c2(0) = 182 Oe.

The _H_c2(_T_) data at the lower temperatures _T_~1 K in Fig. 11 show a deviation from linearity with a negative curvature. To obtain another estimate of _H_c2(0), the _H_c2(_T_) data in the whole T range were fitted by the empirical power law expression H_{\text{c2}}(T) = H_{\text{c2}}(0)[1 - \frac{(T)}{T_{\text{c}}}\alpha\rbrack with _H_c2(0) and a as fitting parameters and with fixed _T_c = 2.15 K. The fit shown as the dashed curve in Fig. 11 gave the values _H_c2(0) = 188(2) Oe and a = 1.55(3). This estimate of _H_c2(0) is close to the value of 182 Oe obtained above using the WHH formula. These two fits together yield our final value _H_c2(0) = 186(4) Oe. From Fig. 11, it can also be seen that there is negligible anisotropy in the measured _H_c2(_T_) from T = 1.7-2.4 K.

For a type-II superconductor near _T_c, the superconducting coherence length x can be estimated from the measured _H_c2 using the Ginzburg-Landau relation[24]

\[H_{\text{c2}} = \frac{\phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi^{2}},\]

where \phi_{0} = hc/2e = 2.068 \times 10^{-7} G cm2 is the flux quantum. We obtain an estimate of x using instead the zero-temperature value _H_c2(_T_ = 0) = 186(4) Oe arrived at above to obtain _x_(_T_ = 0) = 0.133(2) _m_m.

### Superfluid density

The measured magnetic penetration depth _l_(_T_) in the superconducting state is related to the so-called London penetration depth _l_L(_T_) by[24]

\[\lambda(T) \approx \lambda_{\text{L}}(T)\sqrt{1 + \frac{\xi_{0}(T)}{\ell(T)}},\]

where

\[\xi_{0} = \frac{\hbar v_{\text{F}}}{\pi\Delta(0)}\]

is the BCS coherence length, l is the quasiparticle mean free path, and _v_F is the Fermi velocity. Including the influence of l gives the modified coherence length x as[24]

\[\frac{1}{\xi} = \frac{1}{\xi_{0}} + \frac{1}{\ell}.\]

The limit _x_/_l_ ~0 is called the clean limit and the opposite limit the dirty limit.

The superfluid density _r_s(_T_) is related to _l_(_T_) by[24]

\[\rho_{\text{s}}(T) = \frac{m^{*}c^{2}}{4\pi e^{2}\lambda^{2}(T)},\]

where _m_* is the effective mass of the individual quasiparticles, c is the speed of light in vacuum, e is the elementary

Figure 11: (Color online) Upper critical magnetic field _H_c2 versus temperature T extracted from different types of measurements, as indicated. The straight line is a linear fit to the data near _T_c. The dashed curve is a fit by the expression _H_c2(_T_) = _H_c2(0)[1 - \frac{(T)}{T_{\text{c}}}\alpha\rbrack. The circle at T = 0 K labeled “WHH” is the estimate of _H_c2(_T_ = 0) using the WHH formula in the clean limit (see text).

  charge, and \rho_{\rm s} is the density of quasiparticles that have condensed into the superconducting state, not the density of Cooper pairs which is a factor of 2 smaller. The normalized ratio of \rho_{\rm s}(T) to \rho_{\rm s}(0) is simply

\[\frac{\rho_{\rm s}(T)}{\rho_{\rm s}(0)}=\frac{\lambda^{2}(0)}{\lambda^{2}(T)}.\] (14)

We now estimate whether OsB_{2} is in the clean or dirty limit or somewhere in between, by estimating the ratio \xi(0)/\ell. The value of \xi(0) was derived in the preceding section. We will estimate the mean free path \ell using the measured resistivity at low temperatures and the N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) in Eq. (8). First, the conductivity \sigma is written as [22]

\[\sigma=\frac{ne^{2}\tau}{m^{*}},\] (15)

where n is the conduction carrier density and \tau is the mean free scattering time of the current carriers. We then express \tau= \ell/v_{\rm F}, and from Eq. (15) we get

\[\ell=\frac{\hbar}{e^{2}}\frac{m^{*}v_{\rm F}\sigma}{\hbar n},\] (16)

where in SI units the first term on the right is \hbar/e^{2} =4108 \Omega. Next we write both v_{\rm F} and n in terms of the known N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) and then substitute these expressions into Eq. (16).

The (average) Fermi velocity has not been reported from band calculations. Therefore, we calculate both v_{\rm F} and n from N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) by assuming a three-dimensional single-band model with a spherical Fermi surface, yielding [22]

\[v_{\rm F}=\frac{\pi^{2}\hbar^{3}}{2m_{\rm e}^{2}(m^{*}/m_{\rm e})^{2}}D( \epsilon_{\rm F}),\] (17)

\[n=\frac{\pi^{4}}{3}\Bigg{[}\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m_{\rm e}^{2}}D(\epsilon_{\rm F}) \Bigg{]}^{3},\] (18)

where D(\epsilon_{\rm F}) is the density of states at the Fermi energy in units of states/(erg cm^{3}) for both spin directions. Substituting Eqs. (17) and (18) into Eq. (16), and using \rho= 1/\sigma, gives

\[\ell=\frac{\hbar}{e^{2}}\frac{3(m^{*}/m_{\rm e})^{2}}{\pi^{2}\Bigg{[}\frac{ \hbar^{2}}{2m_{\rm e}}D(\epsilon_{\rm F})\Bigg{]}^{2}},\] (19)

where m_{\rm e} is the free-electron mass. The expression converting D(\epsilon_{\rm F}) in units of states/(erg cm^{3}) to the conventional units of states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions appropriate to the above definition of N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) is

\[D(\epsilon_{\rm F})=N(\epsilon_{\rm F})\Bigg{[}\frac{1}{\rm eV~f.u.}\Bigg{]} \Bigg{(}\frac{1~\rm eV}{1.6022\times 10^{-12}~~\rm erg}\Bigg{)}\frac{N_{\rm A}}{V_{\rm M}},\] (20)

where N_{\rm A} is Avogadro's number and V_{\rm M} is the molar volume. Substituting Eq. (20) into Eq. (19) and putting in the values of the constants gives

\[\ell=2.372\times 10^{-14}\frac{(m^{*}/m_{\rm e})^{2}V_{\rm M}^{2}}{N^{2}( \epsilon_{\rm F})\rho},\] (21)

\[v_{\rm F}=2.622\times 10^{9}\frac{N(\epsilon_{\rm F})}{(m^{*}/m_{\rm e})^{2}V_{\rm M}},\] (22)

where \ell is in cm, v_{\rm F} is in cm/s, N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) is in states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions, V_{\rm M} is in cm^{3} per mole, and \rho is in \Omega cm.

Inserting V_{\rm M}= 16.47 cm^{3}/mol from Table 1, m^{*}/m_{\rm e}= 1 (see Sec. III.2 below), N(\epsilon_{\rm F})= 0.55 states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions from our heat capacity data above, and \rho = 1.55\times 10^{-6}\Omega cm at 2.25 K from Fig. 3 into Eq. (21) gives \ell= 0.137 \mum at 2.25 K. Then using \xi(0)= 0.133 \mum from above gives \xi(0)/\ell(0)= 0.97. Therefore, OsB_{2} is in neither the clean limit nor the dirty limit, but in between. Irrespective of this difficulty, we will initially assume the clean limit in order to be able to carry out calculations for comparison with our measured penetration depth data. From Eq. (22), we also obtain v_{\rm F}= 8.75\times 10^{7} cm/s.

The \rho_{\rm s}(T)/\rho_{\rm s}(0) versus T/T_{\rm c} calculated from the \lambda(T) data using Eq. (14) is shown in Fig. 12. The dashed curve is the T dependence of \rho_{\rm s} expected for a BCS single-gap s-wave superconductor. It is clear that our \rho_{\rm s}(T) shows marked deviations from the single-gap BCS curve. This is consistent with our previous observations for polycrystalline samples. [14] The solid curve through the data is a fit by a two-gap \gamma model. [31] From the fit we obtained \lambda(T\rightarrow 0)= 0.300 \mum.

The partial superfluid densities \rho_{1}(T) and \rho_{2}(T) from the fit to the two-gap model are shown as solid curves in Fig. 12. The T dependences of the two gaps are shown in Fig. 13 plotted as normalized gaps \Delta/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c} versus the reduced temperature T/T_{\rm c}. For comparison, the T dependence of a single s-wave BCS gap is shown as the dashed curve. The T=0 value of the two gaps are \Delta_{1}(0)= 1.88k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c} and \Delta_{2}(0)=1.25k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}, respectively. The ratios of these two gaps to the single BCS gap value \Delta_{\rm BCS}(0)= 1.76k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c} are

Figure 12: (Color online) The normalized superfluid density \rho_{\rm s}(T)/\rho_{\rm s}(0) versus reduced temperature T/T_{\rm c}. The solid curve through the data is a fit by the two-gap \gamma model for superconductivity. The curves \rho_{1} and \rho_{2} are the individual contributions from the two gaps.

  \Delta_{1}(0)/\Delta_{\rm BCS}(0)=1.07 and \Delta_{2}(0)/\Delta_{\rm BCS}(0)=0.71. The values of these two gaps agree by construction with the theorem that in a two-gap superconductor, one of the gaps will always be larger than the BCS gap whereas the second will always be smaller.[10] This constraint is a built-in result of the self-consistent solution to the two-gap \gamma model.

### Additional superconducting parameters

The zero-temperature thermodynamic critical field H_{\rm c}(0) of a superconductor is related to the zero-temperature superconducting gap \Delta(0) in a single-gap BCS model by the expression[24]

\[\frac{H_{\rm c}(0)^{2}}{8\,\pi}=\frac{{\cal D}(\epsilon_{\rm F})\Delta(0)^{2}} {4},\] (23)

where, as above, {\cal D}(\epsilon_{\rm F}) is the density of states at the Fermi energy for both spin directions in units of states/(erg cm^{3}). We use this expression as an approximation to our two-gap model to obtain a value of H_{\rm c}(0). Using the density of states value N(\epsilon_{\rm F})=0.55 states/eV f.u. for both spin directions from the above heat-capacity measurements and Eq. (20) gives {\cal D}(\epsilon_{\rm F})=1.26 x 10^{34} states/(erg cm^{3}). Using the larger gap found from fitting the penetration depth data and \Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=1.88 which gives \Delta(0)=5.45 x 10^{-16} erg, Eq. (23) yields H_{\rm c}(0)=153 Oe. We can now derive the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa using the above H_{\rm c2}(0) =186 Oe via[24]

\[\kappa=\frac{H_{\rm c2}}{\sqrt{2}H_{\rm c}}=0.86.\] (24)

This value is marginally on the type-II side of the value \kappa =1/\sqrt{2} = 0.707 separating type-I from type-II superconductivity, thus justifying the above notation of the measured critical field as being the upper critical field H_{\rm c2} instead of the thermodynamic critical field H_{\rm c}.

Another estimate of \kappa can be obtained using the relation[32]

\[\kappa(T)=\frac{\kappa(0)}{[1+(T/T_{\rm c})^{2}]}=2^{1/2}\frac{2\pi H_{\rm c}( 0)\lambda(0)^{2}}{\phi_{0}[1+(T/T_{\rm c})^{2}]},\] (25)

where \kappa(0), H_{\rm c}(0), and \lambda(0) are the T=0 values of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, the thermodynamic critical field, and penetration depth, respectively. With the value H_{\rm c}(0)=153 Oe obtained above and the value \lambda(0) =0.300 \mum, we get \kappa(0)=6.0 and \kappa(T_{\rm c})=3.0.

Two more estimates of \kappa(T_{\rm c}) can be made using the relations[24]

\[\kappa(T_{\rm c})=0.96\frac{\lambda_{\rm L}(0)}{\xi(0)},\quad({\rm clean\;\;limit})\] (26)

\[\kappa(T_{\rm c})=0.715\frac{\lambda_{\rm L}(0)}{\ell}\cdot\quad({\rm dirty\;\;limit})\] (27)

Using \lambda(0)=0.300 \mum, \xi(0)=0.133 \mum, \ell(T>T_{\rm c}) =0.137 \mum, and Eq. (10), one obtains \kappa(T_{\rm c})=2.17 and 0.78 from Eqs. (26) and (27), respectively.

The above four estimates of \kappa(T_{\rm c}) are all greater than 1/\sqrt{2} and therefore all indicate that single-crystalline OsB_{2} is a small-\kappa type-II superconductor with \kappa(T_{\rm c})=2(1).

### Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations

SdH oscillations in \rho(H) were observed as oscillations in the skin depth, which in turn were obtained from the oscillation frequency shift versus H of a tunnel diode oscillator (TDO) in which the sample is placed inside the inductor of the LC circuit. Oscillations were observed for T=0.12-3.3 K in magnetic fields up to H=14 T. Since H_{\rm c2}(0)=186 Oe from Sec. III.5, such fields quench the superconductivity and the measurements are therefore in the normal state. The inset of Fig. 14 shows an image of the crystal and the direction of the applied field H\|c axis where the c axis points out of the plane of the figure.

The shift \Delta f=f(H)-f(0) in the TDO frequency versus H applied along the c axis measured at T=0.18 K is shown

  versus H in Fig. 14. Small oscillations can be seen riding on a smooth background. This _H_-dependent background is due to the tunnel diode circuit that is partially exposed to the applied field. The oscillations are more clearly visible when a smooth background is subtracted from \Delta f(H) using a nonoscillating piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial algorithm in matlab. Figure 15 shows the resulting oscillating part of the TDO frequency shift _df_ versus the inverse magnetic field 1/H where _df_ is the frequency shift after the background subtraction.

To get the frequencies of the SdH oscillations at each T, a power spectrum was obtained by taking a Fourier transformation of the oscillation data such as in Fig. 15. The resulting power spectra obtained for the measurements at T = 0.12-3.3 K are shown in Fig. 16. The data reveal two clear fundamental frequencies F1 = 2767 T and F2 = 5905 T and possibly a third F3 = 660 T as marked in the plot in Fig. 16, although the intensity of the line at F3 is much weaker than the intensities of the prominent sharp lines at F1 and F2. We also observe the second harmonics for F1 and F2 but none for F3, as shown in Fig. 16 and listed in Table 3.

Recent first-principles calculations of the Fermi surface (FS) showed three bands at the Fermi level, consisting of two nested deformed ellipsoidal surfaces (first and second bands) and a corrugated tubular surface (third band) along the b axis.[21] For a magnetic field applied along the c axis, the two closed electronic orbits which give rise to SdH oscillations are the cross-sectional areas of the two deformed ellipsoids normal to the applied field. The theoretically predicted frequencies of oscillations are 3023 and 5902 T.[21] These values are in reasonable agreement with the experimentally observed frequencies F1 = 2767 and F2 = 5905 T of the SdH oscillations for OsB2 for measurements with H1_c_ axis. Since the frequencies of the SdH oscillations are proportional to the area of the respective electronic orbits, we can assign the F1 oscillations as coming from the smaller inner ellipsoid while the F2 oscillations can be assigned to the outer ellipsoid. For the third tubular band, there are no closed orbits for H1_c_ axis. The origin of the third frequency F3 in Fig. 16 is therefore not understood at present.

The T dependences of the amplitudes _A_(_T_) of oscillation in Fig. 16 can be used to estimate the respective effective masses for the bands responsible for the oscillations. The normalized _A_(_T_) is given by the Lifshitz-Kosevich formula [33, 34]

\[A(T) = \frac{X}{\sinh X},\quad\text{where}\quad X = \pi^{2}\left( \frac{m^{\ast}}{m_{\text{e}}} \right)\left( \frac{k_{\text{B}}T}{\mu_{\text{B}}B} \right),\]

and B \approx H is the magnetic induction and _m_e is the free-electron mass. The dimensionless variable X is proportional to the product of the effective mass and the ratio of the thermal to magnetic energies. Therefore, by fitting the _T_-dependent amplitudes of the peaks in the power spectra in Fig. 1 by Eq. (28) one can obtain the _m_+ values for the Fermi-surface electrons responsible for the respective oscillations. Figures 17(a) and 17(b) show _A_(_T_) for the F1 and F2 peaks, respectively. The fits by Eq. (28) are also shown as solid curves through the data. We obtain m_{1}^{\ast} = 1.03(4)m_{\text{e}} for F1 and m_{2}^{\ast} = 0.81(3)m_{\text{e}} for F2. The band masses predicted by theory for these two orbits are _m_b1 = 1.05m_{\text{e}} and _m_b2 = 0.50m_{\text{e}}, respectively.[21] The electron-phonon coupling constant \uplambda_{\text{ep}} can be estimated by using the expression m^{\ast} = (1 + \uplambda_{\text{ep}})m_{\text{b}}. Using the above values of m^{\ast} and _m_b, we obtain \uplambda_{\text{ep}} = 0 for F1 and \uplambda_{\text{ep}} = 0.63(5) for F2.

Figure 18 shows the power spectra for quantum oscillations measurements performed with H applied perpendicular to the c axis. Due to the shape of our crystal, we were only able to perform measurements with H tilted about 15deg away from the b axis as shown in the inset of Fig. 18. The power spectra reveal nine different frequencies which are labeled in Fig. 18 and their values are given in Table 3.

For H1_b_ axis, theory predicts at least six frequencies for quantum oscillations, two coming from the deformed ellipsoidal Fermi surfaces, and four from different closed orbits on the tubular Fermi surface as shown in Fig. 3 in Ref. [21]. For the two deformed ellipsoidal FS sheets, it was predicted that the frequencies of oscillation would vary linearly with angle as the field H is moved from H1_b_ axis toward H1_c_ axis.[21] Thus, for the first deformed ellipsoid the frequency of

Figure 16: (Color online) Power spectra of Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations obtained at the indicated temperatures from Fourier transformation of the quantum SdH oscillation data such as in Fig. 15 at the indicated temperatures. The spectra are shifted vertically by arbitrary amounts for clarity of presentation.

  oscillation should change at a rate of about -25 T/degree and for the second deformed ellipsoid it should change at a rate of about -3.8 T/degree as one moves away from _H_|_b_ axis.21 The predicted values of the frequencies of oscillation for _H_|_b_ axis are 5490 T and 6246 T, respectively, for the two deformed ellipsoids. If we use the above rates of change in the frequencies and the fact that we measured with H about 15deg away from the b axis, then the expected frequencies are 5115 T and 6189 T, respectively, as listed in Table 3. These values are close to the observed frequencies F6 and F8, respectively. Therefore, we can assign the frequencies F6 and F8 as coming from the two deformed ellipsoidal FS sheets. The assignment of the other frequencies in Table 3 is difficult since the angular dependence of frequencies arising from the tubular FS sheet is not known. We note that frequencies F1 and F2 in Fig. 18 are much smaller and F9 is almost a factor of 2 larger than any of the four frequencies predicted for the tubular FS sheet.21 We suggest that F9 is most likely a second harmonic of F7. The remaining four frequencies F3=2983 T, F4=3812 T, F5=3957 T, and F7=5697 T can be compared to the theoretically predicted frequencies 2177 T, 3265 T, 3888 T, and 5291 T.21 The experimentally observed frequencies are similar to those predicted considering the unknown angular dependence of the frequencies arising from the tubular FS sheet. Thus we can tentatively assign these observed frequencies to the quasi-two-dimensional tubular FS sheet.

The most intense frequencies in Fig. 18, F4, F5, F6, and F8, were used to estimate the effective masses by fitting the T dependences of these frequencies by Eq. (28). We obtain

Figure 17: (Color online) (a) and (b) Fits to the amplitude versus T data for the peaks F1 and F2, respectively, by Eq. (28). The values of the respective effective masses _m_* for the two Fermi-surface extrema are indicated in the figures.

The corresponding theoretically predicted band masses are m_{\rm{b4}}=0.95m_{\rm{e}}, m_{\rm{b5}}=0.92m_{\rm{e}}, m_{\rm{b6}}=0.62m_{\rm{e}}, and m_{\rm{b8}}=0.45m_{\rm{e}}. Using the expression m^{*}=(1+\lambda_{\rm{ep}})m_{\rm{b}}, we estimate electron-phonon interaction constants \lambda_{\rm{4}}= 0, \lambda_{\rm{5}}= 0.23, \lambda_{\rm{6}}= 0.48, and \lambda_{\rm{8}}= 1.13. It should be noted that the frequencies F_{6} and F_{8} arise from the deformed ellipsoidal FS sheets. Thus, we find that \lambda_{\rm{ep}} is larger for the ellipsoidal FS sheets compared to the quasi-two-dimensional tubular FS sheet. This suggests that the superconductivity in OsB_{2} is driven by the two deformed ellipsoidal FS sheets. The average value of \lambda_{\rm{ep}} estimated above from McMillan's formula Eq. (5) was 0.4-0.5 which agrees with our inference that \lambda_{\rm{ep}} is small on some FS sheets and is larger on others. The above experimental and theoretical SdH data are summarized in Table 3.

## IV Summary and Conclusions

We have grown high quality single crystals of OsB_{2} using a novel Cu-B eutectic flux. Measurements on these crystals confirm bulk superconductivity. The crystallographic parameters of a single crystal are described above in Tables 1 and 2 and Fermi surface properties in Table 3. The various parameters describing other normal and superconducting state properties are summarized here in Table 4.

The heat capacity measurements show some unusual behaviors. The zero-field anomaly at the superconducting transition \Delta C/\gammaC\,\approx\,1.3 is smaller than the weak-coupling BCS value of 1.43. We suggest that this arises due to the two-gap nature of the superconductivity in OsB_{2}. The occurrence of two superconducting gaps is supported by the anomalous temperature dependence of the penetration depth which could be fitted by the new \gamma model for multigap superconductors [31] with the magnitudes of the two gaps being \Delta_{1}(T=0)/k_{\rm{B}}T_{\rm{c}}= 1.90 and \Delta_{2}(T=0)/k_{\rm{B}}T_{\rm{c}}= 1.25, respectively. The zero-temperature upper critical field was determined to be H_{\rm{c2}}(0)= 186 Oe. Four estimates of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter gave \kappa(T_{\rm{c}})\,\sim\,1\,-3 and thus indicate that OsB_{2} is a small-\kappa type-II superconductor. We observed an anomalous increase in the heat capacity jump at T_{\rm{c}} measured in a finite magnetic field H. For example, at H\approx\,25 Oe, \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm{c}}\,\approx\,2.5. This anomalous increase in \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm{c}} was confirmed for two batches of crystals.

The high quality of the crystals made it possible for us to study the anisotropy of the FS of OsB_{2} by measuring Shubnikov-de Haas quantum oscillations via contactless rf skin depth measurements. Some experimentally observed frequencies could be assigned to those predicted theoretically. The effective masses estimated for the two deformed ellipsoidal FS sheets are larger than the predicted band masses and suggest a large electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{\rm{ep}}\,\sim\,0.5\,-1 for these FS sheets. A much smaller value of \lambda_{\rm{ep}} was found for the third quasi-two-dimensional tubular FS sheet. These results suggest that the superconductivity in OsB_{2} is driven by the two ellipsoidal FS sheets. This would also explain the negligible anisotropy in the measured upper critical fields between the three crystallographic directions.

MgB_{2} is the most extensively studied multigap superconductor and here we compare our results on OsB_{2} with previous results on MgB_{2}. The reduced heat capacity jump at T_{\rm{c}} and the anomalous (non-BCS) T dependence of the penetration depth observed for OsB_{2} are also observed for MgB_{2}[35, 33]. The magnitudes of the two gaps estimated for MgB_{2} are

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c} Quantity & Value \\ T_{\rm{c}} & 2.10(5) K \\ \rho_{b}(2.25 K) & 1.55 \muO cm \\ \ell_{b}(2.25 K) & 0.137 \mum \\ \chi_{a}(300 K) & -3.9\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol \\ \chi_{b}(300 K) & -6.3\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol \\ \chi_{c}(300 K) & -3.2\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol \\ \bar{x}(300 K) & -4.50\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol \\ \gamma & 1.95(1) mJ/mol K^{2} \\ \Theta_{\rm{D}

  \Delta_{1}(T\!=\!0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}\!=\!1.9 and \Delta_{2}(T\!=\!0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}\!=\!0.75.[35] In OsB_{2}, the two gaps \Delta_{1}(T\!=\!0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}\!=\!1.9 and \Delta_{2}(T\!=\!0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}\!=\!1.25 are closer together. Our Shubnikov-de Haas results indicate that superconductivity in OsB_{2} is driven by the two nested ellipsoidal FSs which have very similar sizes. If both gaps open on these FSs they would be expected to be of similar magnitude. In MgB_{2}, however, the two gaps open up on FSs which have very different topologies, which evidently results in a larger difference between the two gaps.[36] Additionally, as we find for OsB_{2}, the electron-phonon coupling was also found to be significantly different on the different FS sheets in MgB_{2}.[36] However, an important difference between the two systems is that while superconductivity is driven by two FS bands with very different properties in MgB_{2}.[36; 37] superconductivity is most likely driven by the two nested ellipsoidal bands with similar properties in OsB_{2}. This is probably the reason for the negligible anisotropy in H_{\rm c2}(T) and the similar magnitudes of the two gaps in OsB_{2}.

###### Abstract

Single crystals of superconducting OsB_{2} [T_{\rm c}=2.10(5) K] have been grown using a Cu-B eutectic flux. We confirm that OsB_{2} crystallizes in the reported orthorhombic structure (space group _Pmmm_) at room temperature. Both the normal and superconducting state properties of the crystals are studied using various techniques. Heat capacity versus temperature C(T) measurements yield the normal state electronic specific heat coefficient \gamma=1.95(1) mJ/mol K^{2} and the Debye temperature \Theta_{\rm D}=539(2) K. The measured frequencies of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are in good agreement with those predicted by band structure calculations. Magnetic susceptibility \chi(T,H), electrical resistivity \rho(T), and C(T,H) measurements (H is the magnetic field) demonstrate that OsB_{2} is a bulk low-\kappa [\kappa(T_{\rm c})=2(1)] type-II superconductor that is intermediate between the clean and dirty limits [\xi(T=0)/\ell=0.97]) with a small upper critical magnetic field H_{\rm c2}(T=0)=186(4) Oe. The penetration depth is \lambda(T=0).300 \mum. An anomalous (not single-gap BCS) T dependence of \lambda was fitted by a two-gap model with \lambda_{1}(T=0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=1.9 and \lambda_{2}(T=0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=1.25, respectively. The discontinuity in the heat capacity at T_{\rm c}, \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c}=1.32, is smaller than the weak-coupling BCS value of 1.43, consistent with the two-gap nature of the superconductivity in OsB_{2}. An anomalous increase in \Delta C at T_{\rm c} of unknown origin is found in finite H; e.g., \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c} = 2.5 for H \approx 25 Oe.

## I Introduction

Although multigap superconductivity was first addressed theoretically by Suhl _et al._ in 1959,[1] and the first experimental observation of the possible existence of two distinct superconducting gaps was made in 1980 using tunneling measurements on Nb-doped SrTiO_{3},[2] the subject of multigap superconductivity has only recently gained impetus after it was established that several unusual superconducting properties of MgB_{2} could be explained within a two-gap superconductivity scenario.[3, 4] There are now several other candidates for multigap superconductivity such as NbSe_{2} (Ref. [5]), RNi_{2}B_{2}C (R=Lu and Y) (Ref. [6]), Lu_{2}Fe_{2}Si_{5} (Refs. [7 and 8]), and Sr_{2}RuO_{4}.[9]

In multigap superconductors, distinct superconducting gaps exist on different disconnected parts (sheets) of the Fermi surface (FS) although the interband pairing leads to a single critical temperature T_{\rm c}.[10, 11] Most superconductors show multiband conduction but due to interband pairing, the gap has the same magnitude on all bands. When interband pairing is weak then the gaps on different sheets of the FS can have significantly different magnitudes. This can lead to anomalous behavior in the temperature-dependent heat capacity, upper critical magnetic field H_{\rm c2}, and penetration depth \lambda measurements.[3, 6, 11, 12]

The compound OsB_{2} has a layered crystal structure qualitatively similar to that of MgB_{2}, except that the B layers are corrugated in OsB_{2} instead of flat as in MgB_{2}.[13] The crystal structure of OsB_{2} is shown in Fig. 1. Figure 1(a) shows the crystal structure of OsB_{2} viewed at a slight angle from the b axis. Figure 1(b) shows the structure projected on the ab plane. Along the c axis, the boron layers lie between two planar transition metal layers which are offset along the ab plane. We have recently reported[14] several anomalous behaviors for polycrystalline samples of the layered superconductor OsB_{2} which has a superconducting transition temperature T_{\rm c}=2.1 K.[15] These unusual behaviors include a reduced specific heat discontinuity at T_{\rm c} in some samples and a magnetic field penetration depth versus temperature T dependence that was consistent with two-gap superconductivity. We also observed a positive curvature in the T dependence of the upper critical magnetic field H_{\rm c2}. To gain further insights into these interesting behaviors, measurements on single crystals are needed.

The Os atoms are shown as large (red) spheres while the B atoms are shown as the small (blue) spheres. A single unit cell (shown) contains two formula units. (b) Projection of the OsB_{2} structure onto the ab plane.

 Herein we report the growth of OsB2 single crystals, and structure, isothermal magnetization, dynamic and static magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, electrical resistivity, magnetic field penetration depth, and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillation measurements on the crystals to characterize their superconducting and normal state properties. Following a description of the experimental details in Sec. II, the experimental results are given in Sec. III. A summary of the results and our conclusions are given in Sec. IV, including a list in Table 4 summarizing the parameters characterizing the physical properties that we obtained.

## II Experimental details

Single crystals of OsB2 were grown with a high-temperature solution growth method using Cu-B as the flux. First, a polycrystalline sample of OsB2 was prepared by arc-melting Os powder (99.95%, Alfa Aesar) and B chunks (99.5%, Alfa Aesar) taken in stoichiometric ratio. A Cu-B binary alloy was then prepared at the eutectic composition Cu0.83B0.13 by arc-melting. For crystal growth the arc-melted OsB2 sample (~0.5 g) was placed in a 2 mL Al2O3 crucible. About 5 g Cu-B flux was placed on top of the OsB2 ingot. The crucible with a lid was placed in a vertical tube furnace which was then evacuated and purged with high-purity Ar gas repeatedly (~10 times) after which the growth was started in a flow (~60 cc/min) of Ar. The furnace was heated to 800 degC in 30 min, then heated to 1450 degC in 6 h and held at this temperature for 6 h. The furnace was then cooled to 1020 degC at a rate of 2 degC/h and then rapidly cooled to room temperature. Well-formed crystals with flat facets were obtained after the Cu-B flux had been dissolved in dilute nitric (HNO3) acid. A scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of a typical crystal is shown in Fig. 2(a).

Some single crystals were crushed for powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The XRD patterns were obtained using a Rigaku Geigerflex diffractometer with Cu _K_a radiation, in the 2 _th_ range from 10deg to 90deg with a 0.02deg step size. Intensity data were accumulated for 5 s per step.

For single-crystal structure determination, a well-shaped crystal (0.27 x 0.18 x 0.15 mm3) was selected. The data collection for the crystal was performed using a Bruker Apex II instrument with Cu _K_a radiation at T = 100 K and was solved with the latest version of the APEX software package which is reliable for a combination of numerical and multi-scan absorption correction. The initial cell constants were obtained from three series of o scans at different starting angles. Each series consisted of 30 frames collected at intervals of 0.3deg in a 10deg range about o with the exposure time of 5 s per frame. The obtained reflections were successfully indexed by an automated indexing routine built in the APEX program. The final cell constants were calculated from a set of strong reflections from the actual data collection. The data were collected using the full sphere routine by collecting 20 sets of frames with 1deg scans in o with an exposure time of 5 s per frame. This data set was corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. The absorption correction was a combination of a numerical one based on a face indexing and an additional correction based on fitting a function to the empirical transmission surface as sampled by multiple equivalent measurements [16] using the APEX software. [17]

Elemental analysis was done on several (~6) single crystals using energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) using an SEM. The EDS scans showed the presence of only the desired elements Os and B in the single crystals. There was no evidence of Cu in any of the crystals indicating that the flux is not incorporated in the crystals. Reliable quantitative estimates of the relative amounts of Os and B in the crystals could not be done due to the small atomic number of boron.

The temperature dependences of the dc magnetic susceptibility and isothermal magnetization were measured using a commercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetic property measurement system (MPMS5, Quantum Design). The resistivity and heat capacity were measured using a commercial physical property measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design). The resistivity was measured using a four-probe technique with a current of 5 mA along the b axis. The dynamic susceptibility was measured between 0.5 and 2.6 K using a 10 MHz tunnel-diode-driven oscillator (TDO) circuit with a volume susceptibility sensitivity D_x_ = 10-8. [18] The details of the measurement and the extraction of magnetic susceptibility and penetration depth from TDO measurements have been described in our previous work. [14]

## III Results

### Crystal structure of OsB2

The powder XRD pattern for crushed single crystals of OsB2 is shown in Fig. 2(b). With the exception of some very weak peaks of unknown origin, the lines in the x-ray pattern could be indexed to the known orthorhombic _Pmmn_ (No. 59) structure and a Rietveld refinement [19] of the x-ray pattern, shown in Fig. 2(b), gave the lattice parameters a = 4.6855(6) A, b = 2.8730(3) A, and c = 4.0778(4) A. These values are in very good agreement with our previously reported values [_a_ = 4.6851(6) A, b = 2.8734(4) A, and c = 4.0771(5) A] for a polycrystalline sample. [14]

Single-crystal XRD data were obtained at T = 100 K. The systematic extinctions of peaks in the XRD data were consistent with the space group _Pmmn_, [17] in agreement with earlier reports from single-crystal and powder XRD measurements on OsB2. [20] The positions of the atoms were found by direct methods and were refined in full-matrix anisotropic approximation. Some parameters obtained from the single-crystal structure refinement are given in Table 1 and the final atomic positions and anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs) and isotropic displacement parameters (IDPs) are given in Table 2. For boron, the obtained ADPs had large errors most likely due to the small mass of boron compared to osmium. Therefore, only the IDP for boron is reported in Table 1 along with the IDP for osmium. The R factors were the same when the ADP or IDP for boron were allowed to vary indicating that the refinement for this parameter did not influence the fit very much.

### Electrical resistivity

The electrical resistivity r versus T of a single crystal of OsB2 from 1.75 to 300 K measured in zero applied magnetic field H and with a current I = 5 mA applied along the b axis, is shown in Fig. 3. The _r_(_T_) shows metallic behavior with an approximately linear decrease in resistivity on cooling from room temperature to 50 K. This behavior is similar to that observed earlier for a polycrystalline sample. [14] At low temperatures, r becomes only weakly temperature dependent and reaches a residual resistivity r0 = 1.55 _m_tO cm just above 2.2 K as seen in the inset of Fig. 3. The large residual resistivity ratio _RRR_ = _r_(300 K)/_r_0 = 22 indicates a well-crystallized sample.

The inset of Fig. 3 shows the low-_T_ data measured in various H. The r in H = 0 drops abruptly below 2.20 K and reaches zero by 2.14 K, as highlighted in the inset of Fig. 3. This superconducting transition was observed earlier by us

The Os atoms occupy Wyckoff 2_α_ (\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},z) positions and the B atoms occupy 4f (x,\frac{1}{4},z) positions. U11, U22, and U33 are the anisotropic displacement parameters in units of Å2 defined within the thermal parameter of the intensity as e^{-2\pi i/0}\langle 0^{2}\omega_{11}^{2}\omega_{22}^{2}\omega_{32}^{2}\omega_{32}^{2}\omega_{32}^{2}\omega_{32}^{2}\omega_{32}^{2}\rangle. _U_iso are the isotropic displacement parameters.

Figure 3: (Color online) Electrical resistivity _ρ_ for a single crystal of OsB2 versus temperature T with current I = 5 mA along the b axis and with applied magnetic field H = 0 Oe. The inset shows the _ρ_(_T_) data between T = 1.7 and 2.6 K measured in various applied magnetic fields H as indicated.

 for a polycrystalline sample,[14] consistent with the original report in 1975 of superconductivity in OsB_{2} by Vandenberg _et al.[15]_ As expected, the superconducting transition shifts to lower T with increasing H. These data were used to determine the upper critical magnetic field H_{\rm c2}(T) which will be discussed later. In particular, for each applied field H, this H is taken to be H_{\rm c2} for the temperature at which the resistance drops to zero.

### Isothermal magnetization and magnetic susceptibility

#### 1.3.1 Normal state

The isothermal magnetization M versus H applied along the b axis is shown in Fig. 4(a) at various T. At high T> 100 K, M is diamagnetic and proportional to H with a slope that is almost constant between T = 100 and T = 300 K. At lower T, M initially increases with H toward a positive value before showing saturation at a field of about 500 Oe. For higher H, M turns over and becomes diamagnetic. For H> 1 T, M is linear in H with a nonzero y-intercept. A similar M(H) behavior is also observed in measurements with H applied along the a and c axes and is consistent with the presence of a small amount of paramagnetic and/or ferromagnetic impurities in the sample. Contributions from paramagnetic impurities are also observed at low temperatures in our normal state magnetic susceptibility \chi measurements via a Curie-Weiss-type upturn in Fig. 5 below. The M(H) data indicate that the impurity contribution saturates at high H. We extract the saturation magnetization M_{\rm S}(T) by fitting the M(H,T) data above H = 2 T by the expression M(H,T) = M_{\rm S}(T) + \chi_{\rm int}H, where \chi_{\rm int} is the intrinsic susceptibility. The M_{\rm S}(T) data so obtained are shown in Fig. 4(b).

The normal state \chi = M/H versus T for OsB_{2}, measured between 1.8 and 300 K with H = 3 T applied along the a, b, and  Figure 5 also shows the intrinsic susceptibility \chi_{\rm int}(T) obtained by correcting the powder-averaged susceptibility for the presence of ferromagnetic and/or paramagnetic impurities as discussed above. Here we have assumed that M_{\rm S}(T) is isotropic so that we can use the M_{\rm S}(T) data obtained from M(H,T) data for the b axis to correct the powder-averaged susceptibility.

The \chi along different crystallographic directions is anisotropic with the value (averaged between T=100 and 300 K) along the b axis (\approx-6.25 x 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol) being much smaller than the susceptibility along the a (\approx-3.75 x 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol) or c (\approx-3.25 x 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol) axes which are quite similar. The similarity of the \chi values along the a and c axes is surprising given the layered nature of the crystal structure which is built up of alternating Os and B layers in the ab plane that are stacked along the c axis. However, theoretical FS calculations have shown that there are quasi-one-dimensional tubular structures running along the b axis, and the FSs along the a and c axes are quite similar.[21]

As described in Ref. [14], one can estimate the paramagnetic Pauli spin susceptibility \chi_{\rm P} from the intrinsic susceptibility \chi_{\rm int} according to

\[\chi_{\rm int}=\chi_{\rm orb}+\chi_{\rm P},\] (1)

where \chi_{\rm orb} is the total orbital susceptibility, which includes the diamagnetic core contribution, the paramagnetic Van Vleck contribution, and the Landau diamagnetic contribution from the conduction electrons. In Ref. [14], we estimated \chi_{\rm orb}=-7.8 x 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol. However, the accuracy of this estimate for \chi_{\rm orb} is unknown (see also below). Using this value of \chi_{\rm orb}, our measured \bar{\chi}_{\rm int}(300 K) =-4.50 x 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol and Eq. (1), for our single-crystalline OsB_{2} we obtain a powder average \chi_{\rm P}=3.23 x 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol.

From \chi_{\rm P}, one can estimate the density of states at the Fermi level N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) for both spin directions using the relation[22]

\[\chi_{\rm P}=\mu_{\rm B}^{2}N(\epsilon_{\rm F})=\left(3.233\times 10^{-5}\quad \frac{\rm cm^{3}}{\rm mol}\right)N(\epsilon_{\rm F}),\] (2)

where \mu_{\rm B} is the Bohr magneton and the equality on the far right-hand side is for N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) in units of states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions, where "f.u." means "formula unit." Taking the above average value of \chi_{\rm P} for OsB_{2}, we get N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) = 1.00(3) states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions. This value is a factor of 2 larger than the value from our specific-heat measurements below as well as from band-structure calculations [N(\epsilon_{\rm F})=0.55 states/(eV f.u.)].[23] indicating that our estimate of the orbital susceptibility above is too negative. Using Eq. (2) and the band-structure density of states value gives the revised estimate \chi_{\rm P}= 1.8 x 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol. Then using the measured \bar{\chi}_{\rm int}(300 K) and Eq. (1) yields a revised powder-averaged orbital susceptibility \chi_{\rm orb}=-6.3 \times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol.

#### iii.2.2 Superconducting state

The temperature dependence of the anisotropic zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) dimensionless dc volume magnetic susceptibility \chi_{\rm v} of a single crystal of OsB_{2} measured from 1.7 to 2.5 K is plotted in Figs. 6(a)-6(c) in a field of 5 Oe parallel to the a, b, and c axes, respectively, where \chi_{\rm v}=M_{\rm v}/H and M_{\rm v} is the volume magnetization. Complete diamagnetism in the absence of demagnetization effects corresponds to \chi_{\rm v}=-1/4 \pi so the data have been normalized by 1/4 \pi. A sharp diamagnetic drop in the susceptibility along all three directions, below T_{\rm c}=2.05 K, signals the transition into the superconducting state. The large Meissner fraction seen in the FC data for all three directions indicates weak magnetic flux pinning in the crystal. The data have not been corrected for the demagnetization factors N_{\alpha} (\alpha =a,b,c) which give -4 \pi\chi_{\rm v}=\frac{1}{1-\chi_{\rm v}} for the respective measured value. From the ZFC data at the lowest temperatures in Fig. 6, one obtains N_{a}=0.60, N_{b}=0.60, and N_{c}=0.65, yielding N_{a}+N_{b}+N_{c}=1.85. This sum is greater than the value of unity expected for an ellipsoid of revolution. The reason for this discrepancy is not known.

In Fig. 6(d), the temperature dependences of \chi_{\rm v} measured with various H applied along the b axis are shown. As expected the superconducting transition is suppressed to lower temperatures with increasing H. From these \chi_{\rm v}(H) data, the critical field H_{\rm c2}(T) has been estimated using the construction in Fig. 6(d), illustrated for H=5 Oe. The H_{\rm c2}(T) has been determined by fitting a straight line to the data for a given field in the superconducting state just below T_{\rm c} and to the data in the normal state above T_{\rm c} and taking the temperature at which these lines intersect as the T_{\rm c} at that H.

The hysteretic volume magnetization M_{\rm v} normalized by 1/4 \pi versus H loops measured at T=1.7 K with H applied along the a, b, and c axes are shown in Figs. 7(a)-7(c), respectively. There is a large reversible part in all the M_{\rm v} data recorded with increasing and decreasing H which again indicates very weak magnetic flux pinning in the material. The M_{\rm v}(H) data recorded at various fixed T with H applied along the b axis are shown in Fig. 7(d). Similar data (not shown)

Figure 6: (Color online) Temperature T dependence of the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) dimensionless volume susceptibility \chi_{\rm v} in terms of the superconducting volume fraction (4 \pi\chi_{\rm v}) of a single crystal of OsB_{2} with a magnetic field H=5 Oe applied along the (a) a axis, (b) b axis, and (c) c axis. (d) The T dependence of the ZFC superconducting volume fraction 4 \pi\chi_{\rm v} of a single crystal of OsB_{2} measured in various magnetic fields H applied along the b axis. The construction used to determine T_{\rm c}(H) is illustrated by the red straight line for H=5 Oe. At low T, the 4 \pi\chi_{\rm v} values are all more negative than -1 due to demagnetization effects.

  with H along the a and c axes were also recorded. The initial slope of the _M_v(_H_) curves is larger than the value -1 expected for perfect diamagnetism, which indicates a nonzero demagnetization factor, consistent with the 4 _p_x_v(_T_) data in Fig. 6. From the _M_v(_H_) curves in Fig. 7(d), we estimated the critical field _H_c2(_T_) from the construction illustrated in Fig. 7(d) for T = 1.75 K.

The dynamic ac susceptibility _kh_(_T_) measured between 0.6 and 2.5 K at a frequency of 10 MHz in various H is shown in Fig. 8. To determine _H_c2(_T_) from the data in Fig. 8, we fitted a straight line to the data in the normal state and to the data just below _T_c or a given applied magnetic field and took the value of the T at which these lines intersect as the _T_c(_H_). This construction is shown in Fig. 8 for the data at H = 0. By inverting _T_c(_H_), we obtain _H_c2(_T_). The _H_c2 has also been obtained in a similar way from the _kh_(_T_) = _M_(_T_)/_H_ SQUID magnetometer data (not shown here) between 1.7 and 2.4 K in various applied magnetic fields.

### Heat capacity

Figure 9 shows the heat capacity C versus T data measured on a single crystal of OsB2. The main panel shows the _C_(_T_) data measured in H = 0 between T = 1.75 and 48 K. The data below T = 10 K could be fitted by the expression _C_/_T_ = _g_T_2 where the first term is the contribution from the conduction electrons and the second term is the contribution from the lattice. The fit (not shown) gave the values g = 1.95(1) mJ/mol K2 and b = 0.0372(3) mJ/mol K4. From the value of b, one can estimate the Debye temperature _th_D using the expression22

\[\Theta_{\text{D}} = \left( \frac{12\pi^{4}Rn}{5\beta} \right)^{1/3} = \left[ (1.944 \times 10^{6}\frac{n}{\beta} \right\rbrack^{1/3},\]

where R is the molar gas constant, n is the number of atoms per formula unit (_n_ = 3 for OsB2), and the equality on the far right-hand side is for _th_D in K and b in mJ/mol K4. We obtain _th_D = 539(2) K for OsB2. The values of g, b, and _th_D obtained above are in very good agreement with the values we reported previously for an unannealed polycrystalline sample.14

The _C_(_T_) data below T = 3 K measured in 0 and 1 kOe applied field are shown in inset (a) of Fig. 9. A sharp steplike anomaly at T = 2.1 K is observed in the H = 0 Oe data and confirms the bulk nature of the superconductivity in single-crystal OsB2. The anomaly is suppressed to below T = 1.75 K in a field of H = 1 kOe. The inset (b) shows the H = 0 Oe heat capacity plotted as _C_(_T_)/_T_ versus T between T = 1.75 and 2.5 K. The jump in the specific heat D_C_ at the

The 4_π_X_ data have been normalized to a minimum value of −1 at the lowest T. The construction used to determine _T_c(_H_) is shown by the red line for H = 0.

The construction used to determine _H_c2(_T_) is shown by the solid red line for T = 1.75 K.

Figure 9: (Color online) Heat capacity C versus temperature T of a single crystal of OsB2 between 1.75 and 48 K measured in zero magnetic field H. Inset (a) shows the _C_(_T_) data between 1.75 and 3 K measured with H = 0 and H = 1 kOe applied along the c axis. Inset (b) shows the data for H = 0 plotted as _C_(_T_)/_T_ versus T between T = 1.75 and 2.5 K. The solid curve in inset (b) is a construction to estimate the heat capacity jump D_C_ at _T_c.

  superconducting transition _T_c is usually normalized as \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c}. From the construction shown as the solid curve through the data in Fig. 9 inset (b), we obtain \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c} =1.32. This value is smaller than the weak-coupling BCS value 1.43.24 Considering the sharp anomaly observed at _T_c it is unlikely that the smaller value of \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c} arises from a distribution of _T_c's due to inhomogeneities in the sample. We suggest that the small value of \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c} arises from the multigap nature of the superconductivity as evidenced from our penetration depth measurements discussed later.

The electron-phonon coupling constant \uplambda_{\rm ep} can be estimated in the single-gap superconductivity approximation using McMillan's formula [25] which relates the superconducting transition temperature _T_c to \uplambda_{\rm ep}, the Debye temperature \Theta_{\rm D}, and the Coulomb repulsion constant \mu^{*},

\[T_{\rm c} = \frac{\Theta_{\rm D}}{1.45}\exp\left[ { - \frac{1.04(1 + \uplambda_{\rm ep})}{\uplambda_{\rm ep} - \mu^{*}(1 + 0.62\uplambda_{\rm ep})}} \right\rbrack,\]

which can be inverted to give \uplambda_{\rm ep} in terms of _T_c, \Theta_{\rm D}, and \mu^{*} as

\[\uplambda_{\rm ep} = \frac{1.04 + \mu^{*}\ln\left( \frac{\Theta_{\rm D}}{1.45T_{\rm c}} \right)}{(1 - 0.62\mu^{*})\ln\left( \frac{\Theta_{\rm D}}{1.45T_{\rm c}} \right) - 1.04}.\]

From the value \Theta_{\rm D}=539 K obtained above from heat-capacity measurements, and using _T_c =2.1 K we get \uplambda_{\rm ep} =0.41 and 0.50 for \mu^{*}=0.10 and 0.15, respectively. These values of \uplambda_{\rm ep} are similar to those found for polycrystalline samples and suggest that OsB2 is a moderate-coupling superconductor.14

The density of states at the Fermi energy _N_(\epsilon_{\rm F}) for both spin directions can be estimated from the values of \gamma and \uplambda_{\rm ep} using the relation [22]

\[\gamma = \gamma_{0}(1 + \uplambda_{\rm ep}),\]

where

\[\gamma_{0} = \frac{\pi^{2}k_{\rm B}^{2}}{3}N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) = 2.359\,\,\,N(\epsilon_{\rm F}),\]

k_{\rm B} is Boltzmann's constant and the equality on the right-hand side of Eq. (7) is for \gamma_{0} in mJ/mol K2 and _N_(\epsilon_{\rm F}) in states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions. Using the above \gamma=1.95 mJ/(mol K2), we find _N_(\epsilon_{\rm F})=0.59 and 0.55 states/(eV f.u.) for the above \uplambda_{\rm ep}=0.41 and 0.50, respectively. These values are in excellent agreement with the value from band-structure calculations [_N_(\epsilon_{\rm F}) =0.55 states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions].23 This agreement indicates that OsB2 is a weakly correlated electron system, consistent with the observed diamagnetic susceptibility in Fig. 5 above. Henceforth we will take the bare density of states to be

\[N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) = 0.55\,\,\,\,{\rm states/(eV\,\,f.u.)}\]

for both spin directions, which corresponds to \mu^{*}=0.15 and \uplambda_{\rm ep}=0.50.

To obtain the critical magnetic field versus temperature we have measured _C_(_T_) in various H. Figure 10(a) shows the _C_(_T_)/_T_ versus T data between T = 0.3 and 2.5 K, measured in various applied magnetic fields H_{a}. A remanent field of about 25 Oe was present in addition to the applied magnetic field H_{a} in these measurements. For comparison, the true H =0 Oe data from Fig. 9 inset (b) are also shown. The superconducting transition seen as an abrupt jump in _C_(_T_)/_T_ is suppressed to lower T with increasing H_{a} as expected. However, the magnitude D_C_/_T_c of the anomaly at _T_c is initially larger than that observed in zero magnetic field. As shown by the arrows in Fig. 10(a), D_C_/_T_c increases from 1.32 for H = 0 Oe to 2.45 for _H__a_= 0 Oe (which is close to H = 25 Oe) suggesting a divergent nature of C at _T_c in an applied magnetic field.

Figure 10: (Color online) (a) Heat capacity C divided by temperature T versus T of a single crystal of OsB2 in various applied magnetic fields H_{a}. A remanent magnetic field H_{a} \approx 25 Oe was present over the nominal value of the applied field H_{a} listed in the figure legend. The true H =0 Oe data from Fig. 9 inset (b) are also included for comparison. (b) _C_/_T_ versus T2 measured in various true magnetic fields H for a different OsB2 crystal.

  The superconducting anomaly moves to lower T with increasing H and is not observed above _Ha_ = 100 Oe (_H_ = 125 Oe). The step in all data at about T = 1.15 K arises from a problem in the measurement and is not intrinsic to the sample.

To further study the enhanced D_C_ anomaly in low fields we measured _C_(_T_) for another single crystal in various (true) H. The data are plotted as _C_(_T_)/_T_ versus T2 in Fig. 10(b). We again observe that the anomaly at the superconducting transition becomes first-orderlike in a finite field showing that this feature is intrinsic to single-crystalline OsB2.

This DC(_H_) behavior is similar to that recently observed for T2Ga9 (_T_ = Rh and Ir),[26, 27] and for single crystals of ZrB12,[28] where it was suggested that the type-I superconductivity in these materials led to the superconducting transition in a finite magnetic field to be first-orderlike, resulting in a divergent DC(_H_) at _T_c. A similar divergent DC(_H_) at _T_c was observed 75 years ago for the type-I superconductor thallium.[29] The _C_(_T_,_H_) behavior observed for single-crystal OsB2 in Figs. 10(a) and 10(b) is similar to that observed for the materials mentioned above and might suggest that OsB2 is a type-I superconductor. However, our estimates of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter k = 2(1) below indicate that OsB2 is a small-_k_ type-II superconductor. The unusual features in the _C_(_T_,_H_) for OsB2 are therefore not understood at present but might be related to the multigap nature of the superconductivity.

### Upper critical magnetic field _H_c2(_T_)

The _H_c2(_T_) data obtained from all of the above measurements are plotted in Fig. 11. In the temperature range of the SQUID magnetometer measurements (1.7-2.4 K), all the data match well and the temperature dependence of _H_c2 is linear (solid curve extrapolated to T = 0 K in Fig. 11) with the slope \frac{d\Pi}{dT} = -125 Oe/K. This linear slope can be used to get an estimate of the T = 0 K upper critical field using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula for the clean limit H_{\text{c2}}(0) = - 0.693T_{\text{c}}\frac{d\Pi}{dT}|_{\text{c}}.[30] Using the above value of \frac{d\Pi}{dT}|_{\text{c}} = -125 Oe/K and _T_c = 2.10 K, we get _H_c2(0) = 182 Oe.

The _H_c2(_T_) data at the lower temperatures _T_~1 K in Fig. 11 show a deviation from linearity with a negative curvature. To obtain another estimate of _H_c2(0), the _H_c2(_T_) data in the whole T range were fitted by the empirical power law expression H_{\text{c2}}(T) = H_{\text{c2}}(0)[1 - \frac{(T)}{T_{\text{c}}}\alpha\rbrack with _H_c2(0) and a as fitting parameters and with fixed _T_c = 2.15 K. The fit shown as the dashed curve in Fig. 11 gave the values _H_c2(0) = 188(2) Oe and a = 1.55(3). This estimate of _H_c2(0) is close to the value of 182 Oe obtained above using the WHH formula. These two fits together yield our final value _H_c2(0) = 186(4) Oe. From Fig. 11, it can also be seen that there is negligible anisotropy in the measured _H_c2(_T_) from T = 1.7-2.4 K.

For a type-II superconductor near _T_c, the superconducting coherence length x can be estimated from the measured _H_c2 using the Ginzburg-Landau relation[24]

\[H_{\text{c2}} = \frac{\phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi^{2}},\]

where \phi_{0} = hc/2e = 2.068 \times 10^{-7} G cm2 is the flux quantum. We obtain an estimate of x using instead the zero-temperature value _H_c2(_T_ = 0) = 186(4) Oe arrived at above to obtain _x_(_T_ = 0) = 0.133(2) _m_m.

### Superfluid density

The measured magnetic penetration depth _l_(_T_) in the superconducting state is related to the so-called London penetration depth _l_L(_T_) by[24]

\[\lambda(T) \approx \lambda_{\text{L}}(T)\sqrt{1 + \frac{\xi_{0}(T)}{\ell(T)}},\]

where

\[\xi_{0} = \frac{\hbar v_{\text{F}}}{\pi\Delta(0)}\]

is the BCS coherence length, l is the quasiparticle mean free path, and _v_F is the Fermi velocity. Including the influence of l gives the modified coherence length x as[24]

\[\frac{1}{\xi} = \frac{1}{\xi_{0}} + \frac{1}{\ell}.\]

The limit _x_/_l_ ~0 is called the clean limit and the opposite limit the dirty limit.

The superfluid density _r_s(_T_) is related to _l_(_T_) by[24]

\[\rho_{\text{s}}(T) = \frac{m^{*}c^{2}}{4\pi e^{2}\lambda^{2}(T)},\]

where _m_* is the effective mass of the individual quasiparticles, c is the speed of light in vacuum, e is the elementary

Figure 11: (Color online) Upper critical magnetic field _H_c2 versus temperature T extracted from different types of measurements, as indicated. The straight line is a linear fit to the data near _T_c. The dashed curve is a fit by the expression _H_c2(_T_) = _H_c2(0)[1 - \frac{(T)}{T_{\text{c}}}\alpha\rbrack. The circle at T = 0 K labeled “WHH” is the estimate of _H_c2(_T_ = 0) using the WHH formula in the clean limit (see text).

  charge, and \rho_{\rm s} is the density of quasiparticles that have condensed into the superconducting state, not the density of Cooper pairs which is a factor of 2 smaller. The normalized ratio of \rho_{\rm s}(T) to \rho_{\rm s}(0) is simply

\[\frac{\rho_{\rm s}(T)}{\rho_{\rm s}(0)}=\frac{\lambda^{2}(0)}{\lambda^{2}(T)}.\] (14)

We now estimate whether OsB_{2} is in the clean or dirty limit or somewhere in between, by estimating the ratio \xi(0)/\ell. The value of \xi(0) was derived in the preceding section. We will estimate the mean free path \ell using the measured resistivity at low temperatures and the N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) in Eq. (8). First, the conductivity \sigma is written as [22]

\[\sigma=\frac{ne^{2}\tau}{m^{*}},\] (15)

where n is the conduction carrier density and \tau is the mean free scattering time of the current carriers. We then express \tau= \ell/v_{\rm F}, and from Eq. (15) we get

\[\ell=\frac{\hbar}{e^{2}}\frac{m^{*}v_{\rm F}\sigma}{\hbar n},\] (16)

where in SI units the first term on the right is \hbar/e^{2} =4108 \Omega. Next we write both v_{\rm F} and n in terms of the known N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) and then substitute these expressions into Eq. (16).

The (average) Fermi velocity has not been reported from band calculations. Therefore, we calculate both v_{\rm F} and n from N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) by assuming a three-dimensional single-band model with a spherical Fermi surface, yielding [22]

\[v_{\rm F}=\frac{\pi^{2}\hbar^{3}}{2m_{\rm e}^{2}(m^{*}/m_{\rm e})^{2}}D( \epsilon_{\rm F}),\] (17)

\[n=\frac{\pi^{4}}{3}\Bigg{[}\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m_{\rm e}^{2}}D(\epsilon_{\rm F}) \Bigg{]}^{3},\] (18)

where D(\epsilon_{\rm F}) is the density of states at the Fermi energy in units of states/(erg cm^{3}) for both spin directions. Substituting Eqs. (17) and (18) into Eq. (16), and using \rho= 1/\sigma, gives

\[\ell=\frac{\hbar}{e^{2}}\frac{3(m^{*}/m_{\rm e})^{2}}{\pi^{2}\Bigg{[}\frac{ \hbar^{2}}{2m_{\rm e}}D(\epsilon_{\rm F})\Bigg{]}^{2}},\] (19)

where m_{\rm e} is the free-electron mass. The expression converting D(\epsilon_{\rm F}) in units of states/(erg cm^{3}) to the conventional units of states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions appropriate to the above definition of N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) is

\[D(\epsilon_{\rm F})=N(\epsilon_{\rm F})\Bigg{[}\frac{1}{\rm eV~f.u.}\Bigg{]} \Bigg{(}\frac{1~\rm eV}{1.6022\times 10^{-12}~~\rm erg}\Bigg{)}\frac{N_{\rm A}}{V_{\rm M}},\] (20)

where N_{\rm A} is Avogadro's number and V_{\rm M} is the molar volume. Substituting Eq. (20) into Eq. (19) and putting in the values of the constants gives

\[\ell=2.372\times 10^{-14}\frac{(m^{*}/m_{\rm e})^{2}V_{\rm M}^{2}}{N^{2}( \epsilon_{\rm F})\rho},\] (21)

\[v_{\rm F}=2.622\times 10^{9}\frac{N(\epsilon_{\rm F})}{(m^{*}/m_{\rm e})^{2}V_{\rm M}},\] (22)

where \ell is in cm, v_{\rm F} is in cm/s, N(\epsilon_{\rm F}) is in states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions, V_{\rm M} is in cm^{3} per mole, and \rho is in \Omega cm.

Inserting V_{\rm M}= 16.47 cm^{3}/mol from Table 1, m^{*}/m_{\rm e}= 1 (see Sec. III.2 below), N(\epsilon_{\rm F})= 0.55 states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions from our heat capacity data above, and \rho = 1.55\times 10^{-6}\Omega cm at 2.25 K from Fig. 3 into Eq. (21) gives \ell= 0.137 \mum at 2.25 K. Then using \xi(0)= 0.133 \mum from above gives \xi(0)/\ell(0)= 0.97. Therefore, OsB_{2} is in neither the clean limit nor the dirty limit, but in between. Irrespective of this difficulty, we will initially assume the clean limit in order to be able to carry out calculations for comparison with our measured penetration depth data. From Eq. (22), we also obtain v_{\rm F}= 8.75\times 10^{7} cm/s.

The \rho_{\rm s}(T)/\rho_{\rm s}(0) versus T/T_{\rm c} calculated from the \lambda(T) data using Eq. (14) is shown in Fig. 12. The dashed curve is the T dependence of \rho_{\rm s} expected for a BCS single-gap s-wave superconductor. It is clear that our \rho_{\rm s}(T) shows marked deviations from the single-gap BCS curve. This is consistent with our previous observations for polycrystalline samples. [14] The solid curve through the data is a fit by a two-gap \gamma model. [31] From the fit we obtained \lambda(T\rightarrow 0)= 0.300 \mum.

The partial superfluid densities \rho_{1}(T) and \rho_{2}(T) from the fit to the two-gap model are shown as solid curves in Fig. 12. The T dependences of the two gaps are shown in Fig. 13 plotted as normalized gaps \Delta/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c} versus the reduced temperature T/T_{\rm c}. For comparison, the T dependence of a single s-wave BCS gap is shown as the dashed curve. The T=0 value of the two gaps are \Delta_{1}(0)= 1.88k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c} and \Delta_{2}(0)=1.25k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}, respectively. The ratios of these two gaps to the single BCS gap value \Delta_{\rm BCS}(0)= 1.76k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c} are

Figure 12: (Color online) The normalized superfluid density \rho_{\rm s}(T)/\rho_{\rm s}(0) versus reduced temperature T/T_{\rm c}. The solid curve through the data is a fit by the two-gap \gamma model for superconductivity. The curves \rho_{1} and \rho_{2} are the individual contributions from the two gaps.

  \Delta_{1}(0)/\Delta_{\rm BCS}(0)=1.07 and \Delta_{2}(0)/\Delta_{\rm BCS}(0)=0.71. The values of these two gaps agree by construction with the theorem that in a two-gap superconductor, one of the gaps will always be larger than the BCS gap whereas the second will always be smaller.[10] This constraint is a built-in result of the self-consistent solution to the two-gap \gamma model.

### Additional superconducting parameters

The zero-temperature thermodynamic critical field H_{\rm c}(0) of a superconductor is related to the zero-temperature superconducting gap \Delta(0) in a single-gap BCS model by the expression[24]

\[\frac{H_{\rm c}(0)^{2}}{8\,\pi}=\frac{{\cal D}(\epsilon_{\rm F})\Delta(0)^{2}} {4},\] (23)

where, as above, {\cal D}(\epsilon_{\rm F}) is the density of states at the Fermi energy for both spin directions in units of states/(erg cm^{3}). We use this expression as an approximation to our two-gap model to obtain a value of H_{\rm c}(0). Using the density of states value N(\epsilon_{\rm F})=0.55 states/eV f.u. for both spin directions from the above heat-capacity measurements and Eq. (20) gives {\cal D}(\epsilon_{\rm F})=1.26 x 10^{34} states/(erg cm^{3}). Using the larger gap found from fitting the penetration depth data and \Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=1.88 which gives \Delta(0)=5.45 x 10^{-16} erg, Eq. (23) yields H_{\rm c}(0)=153 Oe. We can now derive the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa using the above H_{\rm c2}(0) =186 Oe via[24]

\[\kappa=\frac{H_{\rm c2}}{\sqrt{2}H_{\rm c}}=0.86.\] (24)

This value is marginally on the type-II side of the value \kappa =1/\sqrt{2} = 0.707 separating type-I from type-II superconductivity, thus justifying the above notation of the measured critical field as being the upper critical field H_{\rm c2} instead of the thermodynamic critical field H_{\rm c}.

Another estimate of \kappa can be obtained using the relation[32]

\[\kappa(T)=\frac{\kappa(0)}{[1+(T/T_{\rm c})^{2}]}=2^{1/2}\frac{2\pi H_{\rm c}( 0)\lambda(0)^{2}}{\phi_{0}[1+(T/T_{\rm c})^{2}]},\] (25)

where \kappa(0), H_{\rm c}(0), and \lambda(0) are the T=0 values of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, the thermodynamic critical field, and penetration depth, respectively. With the value H_{\rm c}(0)=153 Oe obtained above and the value \lambda(0) =0.300 \mum, we get \kappa(0)=6.0 and \kappa(T_{\rm c})=3.0.

Two more estimates of \kappa(T_{\rm c}) can be made using the relations[24]

\[\kappa(T_{\rm c})=0.96\frac{\lambda_{\rm L}(0)}{\xi(0)},\quad({\rm clean\;\;limit})\] (26)

\[\kappa(T_{\rm c})=0.715\frac{\lambda_{\rm L}(0)}{\ell}\cdot\quad({\rm dirty\;\;limit})\] (27)

Using \lambda(0)=0.300 \mum, \xi(0)=0.133 \mum, \ell(T>T_{\rm c}) =0.137 \mum, and Eq. (10), one obtains \kappa(T_{\rm c})=2.17 and 0.78 from Eqs. (26) and (27), respectively.

The above four estimates of \kappa(T_{\rm c}) are all greater than 1/\sqrt{2} and therefore all indicate that single-crystalline OsB_{2} is a small-\kappa type-II superconductor with \kappa(T_{\rm c})=2(1).

### Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations

SdH oscillations in \rho(H) were observed as oscillations in the skin depth, which in turn were obtained from the oscillation frequency shift versus H of a tunnel diode oscillator (TDO) in which the sample is placed inside the inductor of the LC circuit. Oscillations were observed for T=0.12-3.3 K in magnetic fields up to H=14 T. Since H_{\rm c2}(0)=186 Oe from Sec. III.5, such fields quench the superconductivity and the measurements are therefore in the normal state. The inset of Fig. 14 shows an image of the crystal and the direction of the applied field H\|c axis where the c axis points out of the plane of the figure.

The shift \Delta f=f(H)-f(0) in the TDO frequency versus H applied along the c axis measured at T=0.18 K is shown

  versus H in Fig. 14. Small oscillations can be seen riding on a smooth background. This _H_-dependent background is due to the tunnel diode circuit that is partially exposed to the applied field. The oscillations are more clearly visible when a smooth background is subtracted from \Delta f(H) using a nonoscillating piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial algorithm in matlab. Figure 15 shows the resulting oscillating part of the TDO frequency shift _df_ versus the inverse magnetic field 1/H where _df_ is the frequency shift after the background subtraction.

To get the frequencies of the SdH oscillations at each T, a power spectrum was obtained by taking a Fourier transformation of the oscillation data such as in Fig. 15. The resulting power spectra obtained for the measurements at T = 0.12-3.3 K are shown in Fig. 16. The data reveal two clear fundamental frequencies F1 = 2767 T and F2 = 5905 T and possibly a third F3 = 660 T as marked in the plot in Fig. 16, although the intensity of the line at F3 is much weaker than the intensities of the prominent sharp lines at F1 and F2. We also observe the second harmonics for F1 and F2 but none for F3, as shown in Fig. 16 and listed in Table 3.

Recent first-principles calculations of the Fermi surface (FS) showed three bands at the Fermi level, consisting of two nested deformed ellipsoidal surfaces (first and second bands) and a corrugated tubular surface (third band) along the b axis.[21] For a magnetic field applied along the c axis, the two closed electronic orbits which give rise to SdH oscillations are the cross-sectional areas of the two deformed ellipsoids normal to the applied field. The theoretically predicted frequencies of oscillations are 3023 and 5902 T.[21] These values are in reasonable agreement with the experimentally observed frequencies F1 = 2767 and F2 = 5905 T of the SdH oscillations for OsB2 for measurements with H1_c_ axis. Since the frequencies of the SdH oscillations are proportional to the area of the respective electronic orbits, we can assign the F1 oscillations as coming from the smaller inner ellipsoid while the F2 oscillations can be assigned to the outer ellipsoid. For the third tubular band, there are no closed orbits for H1_c_ axis. The origin of the third frequency F3 in Fig. 16 is therefore not understood at present.

The T dependences of the amplitudes _A_(_T_) of oscillation in Fig. 16 can be used to estimate the respective effective masses for the bands responsible for the oscillations. The normalized _A_(_T_) is given by the Lifshitz-Kosevich formula [33, 34]

\[A(T) = \frac{X}{\sinh X},\quad\text{where}\quad X = \pi^{2}\left( \frac{m^{\ast}}{m_{\text{e}}} \right)\left( \frac{k_{\text{B}}T}{\mu_{\text{B}}B} \right),\]

and B \approx H is the magnetic induction and _m_e is the free-electron mass. The dimensionless variable X is proportional to the product of the effective mass and the ratio of the thermal to magnetic energies. Therefore, by fitting the _T_-dependent amplitudes of the peaks in the power spectra in Fig. 1 by Eq. (28) one can obtain the _m_+ values for the Fermi-surface electrons responsible for the respective oscillations. Figures 17(a) and 17(b) show _A_(_T_) for the F1 and F2 peaks, respectively. The fits by Eq. (28) are also shown as solid curves through the data. We obtain m_{1}^{\ast} = 1.03(4)m_{\text{e}} for F1 and m_{2}^{\ast} = 0.81(3)m_{\text{e}} for F2. The band masses predicted by theory for these two orbits are _m_b1 = 1.05m_{\text{e}} and _m_b2 = 0.50m_{\text{e}}, respectively.[21] The electron-phonon coupling constant \uplambda_{\text{ep}} can be estimated by using the expression m^{\ast} = (1 + \uplambda_{\text{ep}})m_{\text{b}}. Using the above values of m^{\ast} and _m_b, we obtain \uplambda_{\text{ep}} = 0 for F1 and \uplambda_{\text{ep}} = 0.63(5) for F2.

Figure 18 shows the power spectra for quantum oscillations measurements performed with H applied perpendicular to the c axis. Due to the shape of our crystal, we were only able to perform measurements with H tilted about 15deg away from the b axis as shown in the inset of Fig. 18. The power spectra reveal nine different frequencies which are labeled in Fig. 18 and their values are given in Table 3.

For H1_b_ axis, theory predicts at least six frequencies for quantum oscillations, two coming from the deformed ellipsoidal Fermi surfaces, and four from different closed orbits on the tubular Fermi surface as shown in Fig. 3 in Ref. [21]. For the two deformed ellipsoidal FS sheets, it was predicted that the frequencies of oscillation would vary linearly with angle as the field H is moved from H1_b_ axis toward H1_c_ axis.[21] Thus, for the first deformed ellipsoid the frequency of

The spectra are shifted vertically by arbitrary amounts for clarity of presentation.

  oscillation should change at a rate of about -25 T/degree and for the second deformed ellipsoid it should change at a rate of about -3.8 T/degree as one moves away from _H_|_b_ axis.21 The predicted values of the frequencies of oscillation for _H_|_b_ axis are 5490 T and 6246 T, respectively, for the two deformed ellipsoids. If we use the above rates of change in the frequencies and the fact that we measured with H about 15deg away from the b axis, then the expected frequencies are 5115 T and 6189 T, respectively, as listed in Table 3. These values are close to the observed frequencies F6 and F8, respectively. Therefore, we can assign the frequencies F6 and F8 as coming from the two deformed ellipsoidal FS sheets. The assignment of the other frequencies in Table 3 is difficult since the angular dependence of frequencies arising from the tubular FS sheet is not known. We note that frequencies F1 and F2 in Fig. 18 are much smaller and F9 is almost a factor of 2 larger than any of the four frequencies predicted for the tubular FS sheet.21 We suggest that F9 is most likely a second harmonic of F7. The remaining four frequencies F3=2983 T, F4=3812 T, F5=3957 T, and F7=5697 T can be compared to the theoretically predicted frequencies 2177 T, 3265 T, 3888 T, and 5291 T.21 The experimentally observed frequencies are similar to those predicted considering the unknown angular dependence of the frequencies arising from the tubular FS sheet. Thus we can tentatively assign these observed frequencies to the quasi-two-dimensional tubular FS sheet.

The most intense frequencies in Fig. 18, F4, F5, F6, and F8, were used to estimate the effective masses by fitting the T dependences of these frequencies by Eq. (28). We obtain

The corresponding theoretically predicted band masses are m_{\rm{b4}}=0.95m_{\rm{e}}, m_{\rm{b5}}=0.92m_{\rm{e}}, m_{\rm{b6}}=0.62m_{\rm{e}}, and m_{\rm{b8}}=0.45m_{\rm{e}}. Using the expression m^{*}=(1+\lambda_{\rm{ep}})m_{\rm{b}}, we estimate electron-phonon interaction constants \lambda_{\rm{4}}= 0, \lambda_{\rm{5}}= 0.23, \lambda_{\rm{6}}= 0.48, and \lambda_{\rm{8}}= 1.13. It should be noted that the frequencies F_{6} and F_{8} arise from the deformed ellipsoidal FS sheets. Thus, we find that \lambda_{\rm{ep}} is larger for the ellipsoidal FS sheets compared to the quasi-two-dimensional tubular FS sheet. This suggests that the superconductivity in OsB_{2} is driven by the two deformed ellipsoidal FS sheets. The average value of \lambda_{\rm{ep}} estimated above from McMillan's formula Eq. (5) was 0.4-0.5 which agrees with our inference that \lambda_{\rm{ep}} is small on some FS sheets and is larger on others. The above experimental and theoretical SdH data are summarized in Table 3.

## IV Summary and Conclusions

We have grown high quality single crystals of OsB_{2} using a novel Cu-B eutectic flux. Measurements on these crystals confirm bulk superconductivity. The crystallographic parameters of a single crystal are described above in Tables 1 and 2 and Fermi surface properties in Table 3. The various parameters describing other normal and superconducting state properties are summarized here in Table 4.

The heat capacity measurements show some unusual behaviors. The zero-field anomaly at the superconducting transition \Delta C/\gammaC\,\approx\,1.3 is smaller than the weak-coupling BCS value of 1.43. We suggest that this arises due to the two-gap nature of the superconductivity in OsB_{2}. The occurrence of two superconducting gaps is supported by the anomalous temperature dependence of the penetration depth which could be fitted by the new \gamma model for multigap superconductors [31] with the magnitudes of the two gaps being \Delta_{1}(T=0)/k_{\rm{B}}T_{\rm{c}}= 1.90 and \Delta_{2}(T=0)/k_{\rm{B}}T_{\rm{c}}= 1.25, respectively. The zero-temperature upper critical field was determined to be H_{\rm{c2}}(0)= 186 Oe. Four estimates of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter gave \kappa(T_{\rm{c}})\,\sim\,1\,-3 and thus indicate that OsB_{2} is a small-\kappa type-II superconductor. We observed an anomalous increase in the heat capacity jump at T_{\rm{c}} measured in a finite magnetic field H. For example, at H\approx\,25 Oe, \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm{c}}\,\approx\,2.5. This anomalous increase in \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm{c}} was confirmed for two batches of crystals.

The high quality of the crystals made it possible for us to study the anisotropy of the FS of OsB_{2} by measuring Shubnikov-de Haas quantum oscillations via contactless rf skin depth measurements. Some experimentally observed frequencies could be assigned to those predicted theoretically. The effective masses estimated for the two deformed ellipsoidal FS sheets are larger than the predicted band masses and suggest a large electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{\rm{ep}}\,\sim\,0.5\,-1 for these FS sheets. A much smaller value of \lambda_{\rm{ep}} was found for the third quasi-two-dimensional tubular FS sheet. These results suggest that the superconductivity in OsB_{2} is driven by the two ellipsoidal FS sheets. This would also explain the negligible anisotropy in the measured upper critical fields between the three crystallographic directions.

MgB_{2} is the most extensively studied multigap superconductor and here we compare our results on OsB_{2} with previous results on MgB_{2}. The reduced heat capacity jump at T_{\rm{c}} and the anomalous (non-BCS) T dependence of the penetration depth observed for OsB_{2} are also observed for MgB_{2}[35, 33]. The magnitudes of the two gaps estimated for MgB_{2} are

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c} Quantity & Value \\ T_{\rm{c}} & 2.10(5) K \\ \rho_{b}(2.25 K) & 1.55 \muO cm \\ \ell_{b}(2.25 K) & 0.137 \mum \\ \chi_{a}(300 K) & -3.9\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol \\ \chi_{b}(300 K) & -6.3\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol \\ \chi_{c}(300 K) & -3.2\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol \\ \bar{x}(300 K) & -4.50\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol \\ \gamma & 1.95(1) mJ/mol K^{2} \\ \Theta_{\rm{D}

  \Delta_{1}(T\!=\!0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}\!=\!1.9 and \Delta_{2}(T\!=\!0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}\!=\!0.75.[35] In OsB_{2}, the two gaps \Delta_{1}(T\!=\!0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}\!=\!1.9 and \Delta_{2}(T\!=\!0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}\!=\!1.25 are closer together. Our Shubnikov-de Haas results indicate that superconductivity in OsB_{2} is driven by the two nested ellipsoidal FSs which have very similar sizes. If both gaps open on these FSs they would be expected to be of similar magnitude. In MgB_{2}, however, the two gaps open up on FSs which have very different topologies, which evidently results in a larger difference between the two gaps.[36] Additionally, as we find for OsB_{2}, the electron-phonon coupling was also found to be significantly different on the different FS sheets in MgB_{2}.[36] However, an important difference between the two systems is that while superconductivity is driven by two FS bands with very different properties in MgB_{2}.[36; 37] superconductivity is most likely driven by the two nested ellipsoidal bands with similar properties in OsB_{2}. This is probably the reason for the negligible anisotropy in H_{\rm c2}(T) and the similar magnitudes of the two gaps in OsB_{2}.
