###### Abstract

We report on the temperature dependence of the in-plane magnetic
penetration depth (Œª_(ab)) and first penetration field
[H_(f)‚ÄÑ‚àù‚ÄÑ1/Œª_(ab)¬≤(T) for H‚ÄÜ|‚ÄÜùíû| in 2H-NbS‚ÇÇ single crystals. An
exponential temperature dependence is clearly observed in Œª_(ab)(T) at
low temperature, marking the presence of a fully open superconducting
gap. This compound is the only superconducting 2H-dichalcogenide which
does not develop a charge density wave (CDW). However, as previously
observed in 2H-NbSe‚ÇÇ, this gap (Œî‚ÇÅ‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ1.1‚ÄÜk_(B)T_(c)) is significantly
smaller than the standard BCS weak-coupling value. At higher
temperature, a larger gap (Œî‚ÇÇ‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ1.8‚ÄÜk_(B)T_(c)) has to be introduced to
describe the data which are compatible with a two-gap model. The
superconducting gaps are hence very similar in NbS‚ÇÇ and NbSe‚ÇÇ and we
show here that both of them open in the strongly coupled Nb tubular
sheets independent of whether or not a CDW is present.

## I Introduction

In numerous strongly correlated systems, superconductivity appears in
the vicinity of a second electronic instability. These superconductors
then often show deviations from the weak-coupling BCS theory, which
raises the question of the interplay between the two orders.[1] This
question is particularly well illustrated in dichalcogenides. Indeed, in
1T-TiSe‚ÇÇ,[2, 3] 2H-TaS‚ÇÇ,[4, 5] or 2H-NbSe‚ÇÇ superconductivity coexists
with a charge density wave (CDW). In 2H-NbSe‚ÇÇ the charge density wave
develops for instance at T_(D)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ33 K and coexists with
superconductivity (SC) below T_(c)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ7.1 K.

In parallel, specific heat, tunneling spectroscopy, and de Haas-van
Alphen measurements [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] showed that NbSe‚ÇÇ is characterized
by the coexistence of two superconducting gaps:
Œî‚ÇÅ‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ(1.0‚ÄÖ¬±‚ÄÖ0.1)k_(B)T_(c), which is much smaller than the BCS
weak-coupling value (Œî/k_(B)T_(c)‚ÄÑ‚àº‚ÄÑ1.7) and Œî‚ÇÇ‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ(2.0‚ÄÖ¬±‚ÄÖ0.3)k_(B)T_(c).
It was then initially suggested that the CDW might be at the origin of
Œî‚ÇÅ.[11, 12, 13, 14]

However, scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and specific heat
measurements clearly indicated the presence of a reduced superconducting
gap (of similar amplitude) in the NbS‚ÇÇ system as well,[15, 16] showing
that this interpretation does not hold. Indeed, this isoelectronic
compound is particularly interesting to probe for the possible influence
of the CDW on the superconducting states in dichalcogenides, as it is
the only system among the four 2H layered superconducting
transition-metal dichalcogenides [17] MX‚ÇÇ (M = Nb, Ta; X = S, Se) which
does not exhibit a CDW transition. Those measurements hence clearly
showed that the presence of two superconducting gaps in
2H-dichalcogenides is not a direct consequence of the presence of a CDW
in some of them.

In a first scenario, those two gaps can be considered as being the
limiting values of one single anisotropic superconducting gap (without
nodes) whereas in an alternative scenario they can be related to
different values of the electron-phonon coupling constants (Œª_(c‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖph))
on different sheets of the Fermi surface (FS) (so-called multiband
superconductivity [18]).

Clear evidence for multiband superconductivity was first obtained in
MgB‚ÇÇ for which Œª_(c‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖph) varies from ‚àº1.2 for the 2 dimensional (2D) œÉ
band to ‚àº 0.4 for the 3 dimensional œÄ band.[19, 20] Since the FS of
NbSe‚ÇÇ is composed of four strongly coupled quasi-2D Nb-derived cylinders
(bands 17 and 18 with Œª_(c‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖph) ranging from 0.8 to 1.9) and one
Se-derived pancake sheet with a much smaller Œª_(c‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖph) value ‚àº 0.3
(band 16),[8] it was tempting to ascribe the small superconducting gap
to this reduced Œª_(c‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖph):[21, 22] However, angle resolved photo
electron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements [11, 14] suggested that, in
NbSe‚ÇÇ, both gaps open on the tubular sheets and the situation seems to
be quite different from that of MgB‚ÇÇ as the two gaps could both be
associated with the same (strongly coupled) FS sheets. However, an
experimental confirmation that the two gaps are also related to the same
FS sheets in NbS‚ÇÇ was still lacking.

In order to address this issue, we have performed in-plane penetration
depth and penetration field measurements in NbS‚ÇÇ single crystals.
Indeed, Œª is a directional probe and corresponding measurements are only
sensitive to supercurrents flowing perpendicularly to the direction of
the applied magnetic field. Band structure calculations in NbSe‚ÇÇ have
for instance shown that the tubular sheets contribute 98

STS and specific heat (C_(p)) measurements clearly showed that NbSe‚ÇÇ and
NbS‚ÇÇ systems share the particularity of each having two superconducting
gaps but also highlighted some fundamental differences. Indeed, whereas
vortices exhibit a clear stellar shape in NbSe‚ÇÇ, they appear to be
isotropic in NbS‚ÇÇ. Moreover, the two systems have very different
anisotropies of their upper critical fields, increasing from ‚àº3.2 in
NbSe‚ÇÇ[9] to ‚àº8.1 in NbS‚ÇÇ.[24] However, the vortex shape and H_(c2)
values are determined by the coherence length (Œæ), which is related to
the superconducting gap but also to electronic properties of the normal
state (Fermi velocity and possibly electronic mean free path in the
so-called dirty limit). In contrast, the temperature dependence of the
penetration depth is determined only by the superconducting gap
structure. Those later measurements hence provide very valuable
information to help understand those differences and will be discussed
at the end of the paper.

## II Sample and experiments

H-NbS‚ÇÇ samples were grown using the vapor transport growth technique
with a large sulfur excess, as described elsewhere.[25] Single crystals
have a flat hexagonal or triangular shape and typical dimensions of
150¬≤√ó 30 Œºm. The large flat faces grow perpendicular to the c axis. The
2H crystallographic structure has been checked on each sample using a
four-circle diffractometer. The bulk critical temperature was checked on
several samples of each batch by ac specific heat.[16] All the measured
crystals showed sharp superconducting transitions (ŒîT_(c)‚ÄÑ‚àº‚ÄÑ0.3 K) at
T_(c)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ(6.05‚ÄÖ¬±‚ÄÖ0.2) K, emphasizing the excellent bulk homogeneity of
each crystal. Previous scanning tunneling microscopy measurements on
single crystals of the same origin confirmed the absence of a CDW down
to 0.1 K.[15] To avoid contamination by oxygen intercalation between
layers, which would reduce T_(c) and smear the transition,[24] samples
were kept in vacuum. All the measurements were carried out in the first
month following the growth of the samples.

A high-stability LC oscillator operating at 14 MHz, driven by a tunnel
diode,[26; 27; 28] has been used to measure the variation of the
magnetic penetration depth. The tiny sample, placed in the center of the
solenoid coil, acts as a small perturbation to the inductance (L). By
changing the temperature of the sample, the magnetic penetration depth
variations produce a change of the inductance, leading to a change in
the LC resonant frequency Œ¥f(T). The amplitude of the ac excitation
field is smaller than 1 ŒºT (that is, ‚ÄÑ‚â™‚ÄÑH_(c1)) to keep the sample in
the Meissner state. This technique enables us to measure the variation
of Œª with an excellent sensitivity as our setup can detect relative
frequency changes Œ¥f/f‚ÇÄ of a few times 10‚Åª‚Åπ, which corresponds to
changes in Œª on the order of 1 A in mm¬≥ samples. The sample is glued
with vacuum grease at the bottom of a sapphire cold finger whose
temperature is regulated between T_(min)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ0.5 and 10 K whereas the LC
oscillator remains at fixed temperature (3 K). The frequency shift
Œ¥f‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑf(T)‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖf(T_(min)) is then proportional to the magnetic penetration
depth:

$$\delta\lambda(T)=R\frac{\delta f(T)}{\Delta f_{0}},$$
(1)

where Œîf‚ÇÄ is the change induced by the introduction of the
superconducting sample in the coil (measured _in situ_ by extracting the
cold finger from the coil at the lowest temperature), and R is an
effective dimension which depends on the sample geometry. In principle,
R can be evaluated by using the formula proposed by Prozorov _et
al.[29]_ in the case of cylinders. However, recent measurements in
pnictides highlighted the difficulties of evaluating this effective
dimension, in particular for magnetic fields perpendicular to the ab
planes (main sample surface).[30] Indeed, very different Œ¥Œª(T) were
obtained by different groups, most probably due to the roughness of the
sample edges, which undermines this evaluation.

To overcome this difficulty we have performed first penetration field
(H_(f)) measurements using miniature GaAs-based quantum-well Hall probe
arrays. The remanent local dc field [B_(rem)(H_(a))] in the sample has
been measured after applying a magnetic field H_(a) and sweeping the
field back to zero. In the Meissner state, no vortices penetrate the
sample and B_(rem) remains equal to zero up to H_(a)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑH_(f). A finite
B_(rem) value is then obtained for H_(a)‚ÄÑ‚â•‚ÄÑH_(f) due to vortices which
remain pinned in the sample. As H_(f) is directly proportional to the
first critical field H_(c1)‚ÄÑ‚àù‚ÄÑ1/Œª¬≤, the normalized in-plane superfluid
density,

$$\tilde{\rho}_{ab}(T)=\frac{\lambda_{0}^{2}}{\lambda_{ab}^{2}(T)}=\frac{1}{ \left[1+\frac{R}{\lambda_{0}\Delta f_{0}}\delta f(T)\right]^{2}},$$
(2)

is expected to vary as H_(f)(T)/H_(f)(0) (where Œª‚ÇÄ is the
zero-temperature penetration depth). Even though the uncertainties on
the H_(f) values hinders any precise determination of the gap values,
those measurements can then be used as milestones to obtain the R/Œª‚ÇÄŒîf‚ÇÄ
coefficient (see inset of Fig. 3).

## III Evidence for a small gap value in NbS‚ÇÇ

Figure 1 shows typical Œ¥f(T) curves between 0.08 T_(c) and 0.85 T_(c)
for three NbS‚ÇÇ single crystals (see inset of Fig. 1). The magnetic field
is applied perpendicularly to the layers, i.e., along the
crystallographic c axis, so that supercurrents are flowing in the
layers, probing the in-plane penetration

depth, Œª_(ab).[31] Samples B and D were grown in the same batch and have
in-plane dimensions equal to 110 and 140 Œºm, respectively, and
thicknesses t‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ30 and 25 Œºm, respectively. Sample C8 was grown in a
second batch and has a larger size (430¬≤‚ÄÖ√ó‚ÄÖ110Œºm¬≥). The frequency shift
is ten times higher for C8 than for other samples due to it larger
volume but all renormalized curves are fully identical, underlying the
excellent reproducibility of the temperature dependence discussed below.

In the local London theory, at low temperature (typically T‚ÄÑ<‚ÄÑT_(c)/3),
the temperature dependence of the gap can be neglected and Œª(T) is given
by

$$(\lambda(T)-\lambda_{0})/\lambda_{0}=\sqrt{\frac{\pi\,\Delta(0)}{2k_{B}T}}e^{- \Delta(0)/k_{B}T},$$
(3)

where k_(B) is the Boltzmann constant and Œî(0) is the value of the
smallest superconducting gap at 0 K. Indeed, due to this exponential
dependence only the smallest gap is expected to show up at low
temperature. As shown in Fig. 2 a very poor agreement to the data is
obtained if the gap parameter is fixed to the weak-coupling BCS gap of
1.76k_(B)T_(c). A much better fit is obtained by taking Œî/k_(B)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ7.2 K
‚ÄÑ‚âà‚ÄÑ1.2T_(c). Note that this gap value does not depend on the
renormalization constant. The assumption
$\lambda(T_{\rm min})\approx\lambda_{0}$, where $T_{\rm min}$ is the
lowest experimental temperature, is valid here, since an extrapolation
of Eq. (3) gives
$[\lambda(0.5\ {\rm K})-\lambda_{0}]/\lambda_{0}<10^{-3}$. Since the
superfluid current mainly originates from the Nb sheets for H‚à•c, those
measurements hence directly show that this small gap is associated with
those sheets in NbS‚ÇÇ as well.

In order to get information on the larger gap, it is necessary to
perform a detailed analysis of the temperature dependence at higher
temperature. The inset of Fig. 3 displays the temperature dependence of
the superfluid density œÅÃÉ_(ab)(T) up to T_(c) deduced from Eq. (2) for
different R/Œª‚ÇÄŒîf‚ÇÄ values compared to H_(f)/H_(f)(0). Note that a small
change in R/Œª‚ÇÄŒîf‚ÇÄ will modify strongly the normalized superfluid
density, but the curvature of H_(f)(T) is essentially independent of Œª‚ÇÄ.
H_(f)(T) can hence be used to determine R/Œª‚ÇÄŒîf‚ÇÄ with good accuracy and,
as shown, a good agreement between H_(f) and the superfluid density is
obtained by taking R/Œª‚ÇÄŒîf‚ÇÄ‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ0.02 Hz‚Åª¬π. Clear deviations from the BCS
weak-coupling theoretical curve (dashed line) are visible throughout the
entire temperature range. In particular, the BCS values exceed the
experimental data at low temperature due to the small value of the gap.

In the multigap model, œÅÃÉ is phenomenologically assumed to be the sum of
two independent superfluid densities,

$$\tilde{\rho}=\omega\tilde{\rho_{1}}+(1-\omega)\tilde{\rho_{2}},$$
(4)

where œâ is the weight of band 1 and $\tilde{\rho_{i}}$ are given by

$$\tilde{\rho_{i}}(T)=1-\int\frac{\partial f}{\partial E}\frac{E}{\sqrt{E^{2}- \Delta_{i}^{2}(T)}}.$$
(5)

The best fit to the data using Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) (solid line in Fig.
3) is obtained with Œî‚ÇÅ‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ(1.05‚ÄÖ¬±‚ÄÖ0.05)k_(B)T_(c) and
Œî‚ÇÇ‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ(1.8‚ÄÖ¬±‚ÄÖ0.1)k_(B)T_(c) with œâ‚ÄÑ‚àº‚ÄÑ0.5. Those values are in very good
agreement with those deduced from tunneling spectroscopy measurements,
which revealed a distribution of gaps having two main values at 0.53 meV
= 6.15 K ‚ÄÑ‚âà‚ÄÑ1‚ÄÜk_(B)T_(c) and 0.98 meV = 10.8 K ‚ÄÑ‚âà‚ÄÑ1.8‚ÄÜk_(B)T_(c).[15]
Moreover, the temperature dependence of the specific heat measured on
sample C8 can be well described by taking Œî‚ÇÅ‚ÄÑ‚àº‚ÄÑ1.05k_(B)T_(c),
Œî‚ÇÇ‚ÄÑ‚àº‚ÄÑ2.1k_(B)T_(c)

sample C8. As shown, the weak-coupling BCS normalized superfluid density
(dashed line) is not compatible with the data. A very similar

triangles) and both compounds could be well described by a two-gap model
(thick line; see text for details). Inset: Influence of the R/Œª‚ÇÄŒîf‚ÇÄ

approximation (see text) to determine the smaller gap Œî. An excellent
fit is obtained for Œî‚ÄÑ‚âà‚ÄÑ1.17‚ÄÜk_(B)T_(c). Results cannot be described by
an exponential behavior with the weak-coupling BCS value

and œâ‚ÄÑ‚àº‚ÄÑ0.6.[16] Even if this two-gap model well reproduces the
temperature dependence of Œ≤_(i) it is worth noting that this temperature
dependence is also compatible with a single anisotropic in-plane
superconducting gap. The simplest model which respects the symmetry of
the crystal has an in-plane six-fold shape,
$\Delta(\phi)=\Delta_{1}+\frac{\Delta_{2}-\Delta_{1}}{2}[1+\cos(6\phi)]$,
where the extrema of the superconducting gap define two characteristic
energy scales. With this model, we find Œî‚ÇÅ‚ÄÑ‚àº‚ÄÑ0.9(1)k_(B)T_(c) and
Œî‚ÇÇ‚ÄÑ‚àº‚ÄÑ1.9(3)k_(B)T_(c).

## IV Comparison between NbS‚ÇÇ and NbSe‚ÇÇ

We have also reported in Fig. 3 the temperature dependence of Œ≤_(ab)
deduced from penetration depth measurements in 2H-NbSe‚ÇÇ.[12] Since the
critical temperatures are slightly different in the two compounds, the
data have been plotted as a function of T/T_(c) with T_(c)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ6.05 and
7.1 K for NbS‚ÇÇ and NbSe‚ÇÇ, respectively. In both case, the presence of
two characteristic gap values is necessary to fit the temperature
dependence of the in-plane superfluid density. We hence show that in
both compounds the exotic superconducting gap structure is related to
the Nb tubular sheets and that, even if the charge density wave is
perturbing those sheets in NbSe‚ÇÇ (but not in NbS‚ÇÇ, which does not
exhibit any CDW), this CDW does not affect the superconducting gap
structure. Our results hence contradict the ARPES measurements on
NbSe‚ÇÇ,[11] which suggested a strong correlation between the gap
structure and the CDW formation. The presence of an identical exotic gap
structure in two different compounds (even of the same family) is
particularly rare, highlighting the robustness of the underlying
mechanism at its origin. It is worth noting that there exists a R/Œª‚ÇÄŒîf‚ÇÄ
value (‚àº0.02 Hz‚Åª¬π; see above) for which the temperature dependencies
obtained for both compounds are very similar on the whole temperature
range.

Note that this strong similitude in the gap structure is not in
contradiction with the fact that the vortex cores have an isotropic
shape in NbS‚ÇÇ[15] and six-fold shape in NbSe‚ÇÇ.[32, 33] Indeed, in this
later case, the particular shape could be due to an anisotropic Fermi
velocity[34] caused by the presence of the charge density wave.

Finally, It is interesting to note that even with similar
superconducting gaps, it is possible to understand the large difference
of the anisotropy of the upper critical field in the two systems. In the
case of NbSe‚ÇÇ, the anisotropy of the upper critical field can be
understood by the anisotropy of the two set of Nb bands. Indeed, the
coherence length related to the pancake band is larger due to a large
renormalized Fermi velocity and a small gap.[8] According to band
structure calculations, the anisotropies of the Fermi velocities
(v_(F)^(ab)/v_(F)^(c)) of the two tubular sheets are on the order of 2
(Band 17[75]) and 10 (Band 18) in NbSe‚ÇÇ, neither of which corresponds to
the experimental value of the anisotropy of the upper critical field
(‚àº3.2)[23]. However, Œº‚ÇÄH_(c2)^(1c)(0)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑŒ¶‚ÇÄ/2œÄŒæ_(ab)¬≤ is defined by the
band having the smallest Œæ_(ab) value. All bands have quite similar
in-plane Fermi velocities but if one assumes that Œî‚ÇÇ is associated with
band 17 and Œî‚ÇÅ is associated with band 18, one gets
Œæ_(ab,‚ÄÜ17)‚ÄÑ‚àº‚ÄÑ(Œî‚ÇÅ/Œî‚ÇÇ)Œæ_(ab,‚ÄÜ18)‚ÄÑ‚àº‚ÄÑŒæ_(ab,‚ÄÜ18)/1.7 and H_(c2)^(1c) will be
defined by band 17. Moreover, for Œº‚ÇÄH_(c2)^(1ab)(0)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑŒ¶‚ÇÄ/2œÄŒæ_(ab)Œæ_(c),
the very small value of c-axis Fermi velocity of band 18 implies that
H_(c2)^(1ab) will be defined by this latter band. One hence gets
H_(c2)^(1ab)/H_(c2)^(1c)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ(v_(F)^(ab,‚ÄÜ17)v_(F)^(ab,‚ÄÜ17)/v_(F)^(ab,‚ÄÜ18)v_(F)^(c,‚ÄÜ18))(Œî‚ÇÅ/Œî‚ÇÇ)¬≤‚ÄÑ‚àº‚ÄÑ10/(1.7)¬≤‚ÄÑ‚àº‚ÄÑ3,
in good agreement with the experimental value. Note that this situation
strongly differs from the one observed in MgB‚ÇÇ in which the anisotropy
of H_(c2) is defined only by the œÉ band (for T‚ÄÑ‚â™‚ÄÑT_(c)). As NbSe‚ÇÇ and
NbS‚ÇÇ have similar H_(c2)^(1ab) values, one can conclude that band 18 is
not affected by the chemical substitution and the increase of the H_(c2)
anisotropy to ‚àº8.1 in NbS‚ÇÇ is hence due to an increase of v_(F)^(ab,‚ÄÜ17)
but this change in the Fermi velocity does not affect the
superconducting gap structure.

The presence of two characteristic gap values appears to be a robust
characteristic feature in 2H dichalcogenides, but its origin is still
open to questions. With the present results, the influence of the CDW
also has to be excluded, underlying the necessity of proposing new clues
for the origin of the reduced superconducting gap observed in both
compounds.

## V Conclusion

The temperature dependence of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth of
single crystals of 2H-NbS‚ÇÇ has been measured and compared to previous
measurements on 2H-NbSe‚ÇÇ. The temperature dependence shows a similar
curvature in both compounds, evidencing a similar reduced
superconducting gap structure in the sheets of the Fermi surface where
the e-ph coupling constant is the largest. The CDW, present only in
NbSe‚ÇÇ, is not at the origin of the reduced superconducting gap. In the
light of the discovery of a particular acoustic phonon mode observed in
lead or niobium,[36] more accurate knowledge of the phonon dispersion in
NbS‚ÇÇ could shed insight into the origins of the reduced superconducting
gap in the dichalcogenides.
