## I Introduction

Superconductivity (SC) found in the quaternary oxyarsenide
LaFeAsO¹⁻F${}_{\rm y}$ resumed great activities toward discovery of a
new superconductor in scientific communities because of prospect for
achieving high $T_{\rm c}$.[1] Within few years after the discovery, the
$T_{\rm c}$ went over 50 K by replacing La to other rare-earth element
and materials varieties were rapidly developed: many Fe pnictides
containing the Fe₂As₂ layer in each structure have been proved to become
superconducting, e.g., AFe₂As₂ (A=alkaline earth),[2]AFeAsF,[3] and
Sr₄Sc₂Fe₂P₂O₆.[4] It is noteworthy that the Fe-based superconductors may
have practical values because their upper-critical field is remarkably
high.[5]

The SC of the Fe pnictide emerges after the spin-density wave (SDW) is
suppressed by chemical or physical methods, being analogical with the SC
of the Cu oxide.[6] The Fe₂As₂ layer is believed to play a decisive role
of establishing the SC as does the CuO₂ layer.[7] These facts imply that
the Fe pnictides and the Cu oxides may share common physics in part
regarding the mechanism of the SC. To date tremendous activities were
performed to reveal nature of the SC of the Fe pnictides; however, the
nature seems not to be well uncovered yet. For example, the SC gap
symmetry is still under debate. In early theoretical studies, there
seems to be a consensus that the gap symmetry is of a sign-reversal s
wave (often notated as s_(±) wave) as proposed independently by Mazin
_et al._,[8] Kuroki _et al._,[9, 10] and Tesanovic _et al._[11, 12]
Probable nesting between separated pockets of the Fermi surfaces may
enhance spin fluctuations, helping to generate the SC. In the early
studies, the SC gap has no nodes; full gap opening was predicted.[13,
14] The gap symmetry model was further supported by experiments
including NMR studies,[13, 15, 16] angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy,[17, 18] microwave penetration depth measurements,[19]μSR
studies,[20, 21] and neutron-scattering studies[22, 23] on varieties of
the Fe-based superconductors.

However, the pairing model seems not to meet results of impurity
studies: many doped elements to the Fe-based superconductor rather work
weakly for the SC. For example, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ir were found to
even work to produce the SC by each doping, suggesting that the Fe-based
superconductor is highly robust against an impurity.[24, 25, 26, 27, 28]
The observations seemed to sharply contrast to what is expected for the
s_(±)-wave SC (Refs. [29] and [30]) since the s_(±)-wave SC is supposed
to be quite fragile against even a nonmagnetic impurity unlike the
conventional s-wave SC (BCS SC is normally robust against nonmagnetic
impurities as observed for MgB₂ for instance[31]).

Additional theoretical studies, however, suggested that the s_(±)-wave
model can be possibly consistent with the robust SC if certain
conditions such as a small impurity potential (≪1 eV) and a large
potential radius are effective in the SC.[29, 30] Nevertheless, the
issue regarding inconsistency between the s_(±)-wave model and the
results of the impurity studies seems to eventually complicate
discussions about the mechanism of the SC of the Fe pnictide, and the
issue is thus subjected for further studies. To our best knowledge, a
fragile SC against a nonmagnetic impurity was not observed yet for any
Fe-pnictide superconductor at the time of submission of this
article.[32, 33] Before the high-pressure synthesis of
LaFeAsO_(0.85),[34] it appeared that the doped Zn to
LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) does not reduce $T_{\rm c}$ (<10 at.

In this paper, we report a large $T_{\rm c}$ decrease achieved by a
minimal level of Zn (below 3 at.

## II Experimental

Polycrystalline samples of Zn-doped LaFe_(1 − x)Zn_(x)AsO_(0.85)
(x=0,0.005,0.01,0.015,0.02,0.03,0.05) were prepared by solid-state
reaction under high pressure from powders of LaAs (lab-made), Fe₂O₃ (3N,
Furuuchi Chem. Co.), ZnO (3N, Wako), and Fe (3N, 100 mesh, Rare Metallic
Co.). LaAs was prepared in advance from La pieces (3N, Nilaco Co.) and
As powder (5N, High Purity Chem.) with 1 at.

The starting mixture each was placed into a hexagonal boron nitrogen
(h-BN) cell (preheated in advance at ∼2000 ^(∘)C for 1 h in nitrogen)
and the cell was sealed in a gold capsule. The sample-contained capsule
was heated each at 1300 ^(∘)C for 2 h in a belt-type pressure apparatus,
which is capable of maintaining 6 GPa during the heating, followed by
quenching to room temperature before releasing the pressure. To increase
uniformity of the sample, the obtained pellet was carefully ground and
reheated at the same condition.

The samples of the oxygen vacancy-controlled LaFeAsO_(1 − δ)
(δ=0,0.12,0.15,0.22) were prepared in the same way under high pressure,
except the δ=0 sample. The δ=0 sample was synthesized in an evacuated
quartz tube at 1100 ^(∘)C for 30 h under ambient pressure because the
pressurized conditions did not work better to improve the sample
quality. The poor quality persisted exceptionally at δ=0 (not due to a
run-to-run error) as observed in the high-pressure synthesis of
TbFeAsO_(1 − δ).[36] It should be emphasized that the optimally
carrier-doped samples (δ=0.15) with and without Zn were all prepared
under the same high-pressure condition.

All samples were qualitatively studied by the XRD method and selected
samples (LaFeAsO_(0.85) and LaFe_(0.99)Zn_(0.01)AsO_(0.85)) were further
investigated by a synchrotron XRD (SXRD) method. The SXRD measurement
was conducted at λ=0.652973 $\AA$ in a large Debye-Scherrer camera at
the BL15XU beam line of SPring-8.[37] The sample capillary, Lindenmann
glass, was rotated during the measurement. The Rietveld analysis was
carried out by using RIETAN-2000.[38] The samples of LaFeAsO_(0.85) and
LaFe_(0.99)Zn_(0.01)AsO_(0.85) were further studied by a Mossbauer
spectroscopy, which was carried out at room temperature by using a
conventional constant acceleration drive and a 50 mCi ⁵⁷Co⋅Rh source.
The experimental spectra were analyzed by a least-squares fit procedure.
The velocity calibration and isomer-shift (IS) zero are those of α-Fe
measured at room temperature.

A selected Zn-doped sample (LaFe_(0.95)Zn_(0.05)AsO_(0.85)) was studied
in an electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) at an acceleration voltage of
15 kV (JXA-8500F, JEOL). A surface of the sample pellet was carefully
polished using an aluminated coated sheet. The analysis confirmed that
possible contaminations from such as Au are below the EPMA background
level. Expected peaks due to Zn were confirmed in a
wavelength-dispersive spectrometry, indicating Zn is indeed incorporated
in the sample. The same sample was further studied by an element mapping
operation in EPMA regarding Zn over a square surface approximately 100
μm ×100 μm maximum in area. The doped Zn was observed to evenly spread
out, suggesting that Zn-rich impurities are unlikely formed. Additional
EPMA operations were carefully conducted regarding possible formation of
the Zn-rich impurities; however, any trace of the possibility was
undetected.

The magnetic susceptibility (χ) of the samples was measured in the
magnetic property measurement system, Quantum Design Inc. Loose powder
was cooled to 2 K before applying a magnetic field (zero-field cooling;
ZFC), followed by warming to 300 K in a magnetic field 10 Oe. The sample
was then cooled down to 2 K in the field (field cooling; FC). The
electrical resistivity (ρ) was measured in the physical properties
measurement system (PPMS), Quantum Design Inc., by a four-probe method
with a constant gauge current of 0.2 mA. Hall coefficient ($R_{\rm H}$)
was measured by rotating the sample by 180^(∘) in a field of 50 kOe in
PPMS between 25 and 300 K. Specific heat ($C_{\rm p}$) of the samples
LaFe_(1 − x)Zn_(x)AsO_(0.85) (x=0 and 0.05) was measured in PPMS,
between 2.2 and 300 K by a heat-pulse relaxation method.

## III Results and Discussion

The powder XRD patterns at δ=0.15 (LaFe_(1 − x)Zr_(x)AsO_(0.85)) are
shown in Fig. 1(a). All peaks were well indexed by assuming the
ZrCuSiAs-type structure with P4/nmm as was done for TbFeAsO_(0.85).[39]
Although the XRD analysis indicated that the samples are of high
quality, the SXRD analysis [Figs. 1(b) and 1(c)] found a tiny amount of
LaAs incorporated in the sample regardless of amount of Zn. The
incorporated LaAs was actually confirmed by the EPMA. The impurity may
result from the compositional issue of the starting LaAs powder prepared
with the excess As.

Rietveld analysis of the SXRD patterns was carefully carried out and the
results are shown in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c). A reliable structure solution
was obtained.[40] The mean La-As distance is 3.3577(6) at x=0 and
3.3570(6) at x=0.01, and the Fe-As-Fe angle in the Fe₂As₂ layer is
113.09(9)^(∘) and 113.20(9)^(∘), respectively. Although La-As distance
and the angle were suggested to play a crucial role in controlling the
effective bandwidth, thereby affecting the SC,[41] those were confirmed
to change quite little over the Zn substitution.

The lattice parameters of the tetragonal unit cell, deduced from the XRD
patterns, were plotted against the Zn concentration as shown in Figs.
2(a)-2(c). For a comparison, the lattice parameters of the oxygen
vacancy-controlled samples LaFeAsO_(1 − δ) were plotted along the
Zn-doped data. Regarding LaFeAsO_(1 − δ) the tetragonal lattice
parameters a and c decrease with increasing δ as well as what was found
for the compounds TbFeAsO_(1 − δ).[36] This probably reflects
combination of Coulomb attractive forces between the charged
[LaO_(1 − δ)]^(1 + 2δ) and [FeAs]^(1 − 2δ) layers and amount of vacate
sites for oxygen atoms. In sharp contrast to the observation, the Zn
substitution resulted in an anisotropic change in the lattice
parameters: c of LaFe_(1 − x)Zn_(x)AsO_(0.85) increases (+0.02

Additionally, selected Zn-doped samples were further characterized by
measurements of Hall coefficient, conducted from 300 to 25 K. The data
are shown in Fig. 3 for the samples with and without 2 at.

Let us see the superconducting properties of the Zn-doped samples of
LaFe_(1 − x)Fe_(x)AsO_(0.85). Figures 4(a)-4(g) show Zn concentration
dependence of χ vs T. In Fig. 4(a), the Zn-free sample with optimally
carrier doped (δ=0.15) clearly undergoes a superconducting transition at
∼26 K as was reported elsewhere.[34] Employing the calculated density of
7.85 g/cm³, the magnetic shielding fraction is estimated to be 1.13
(1.00 is expected for the perfect shielding), indicating homogeneous SC
of the sample. In contrast, the Meissner fraction (5 K, FC curve) is
fairly small, less than 0.1. The contrastive features between the
magnetic shielding and the Meissner fractions were commonly observed for
the oxygen-deficient 1111 systems[39] probably because of possible effi

cient magnetic-flux pins and small particle size not far from the
magnetic penetration depth [∼0.25 μm (Ref. [44]]). In fact, we observed
that the particles are much smaller than 1 μm in the EPMA.

Increasing the Zn concentration, $T_{\rm c}$ quickly goes down; no more
than 3 at.

Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show the temperature dependence of ρ of
LaFe_(1 − x)Zn_(x)AsO_(0.85) and LaFeAsO_(1 − δ) respectively. Regarding
the stoichiometric LaFeAsO, ρ at 300 K is ∼6 $\rm\,m\Omega$ cm, being
comparable with the normalized mean-free path $k_{\rm F}l$= 0.6.[45] The
ρ of LaFeAsO gently varies with a broad minimum at approximately 220 K
and pronouncedly goes down at 150 K, corresponding to the SDW
instability.[45] By introducing the oxygen vacancies, the normal state ρ
becomes much smaller, reflecting increase in the carrier density in the
Fe₂As₂ layer. The residual resistivity ratio [RRR;ρ(300
K)/ρ($T_{\rm c}$)] at the optimized carrier density for SC
(LaFeAsO_(0.85)) is ∼6, being not far from the values reported for the
Co-doped LaFeAsO.[35]

$T_{\rm c}$ determined by the ρ measurement steeply goes to zero by the
Zn substitution [Fig. 5(a)] in well accord with the
magnetic-susceptibility measurements. Regarding the normal state ρ, the
quadratelike temperature dependence and the prominent upturn on cooling
were observed in the Zn-doped samples (see for example at x=0.01) and
RRR is deteriorated somewhat up to x of 0.01, probably reflecting
enhanced scattering factors. The further doped x=0.02 sample, however,
shows antidirection features while the SC remains to be suppressed. It
is possible that the doped Zn works not only as a scattering center for
charges but also to weaken magnetism of the Fe₂As₂ layer, resulting in
the slight improvement of the charge transport as a result of balance of
those factors. The x=0.03 and 0.05 ρ curves show a weak charge
localization, which is probably in the Anderson’s scheme,[46] as the ρ
remains low and the temperature dependence is weak. The increased amount
of Zn in the conducting Fe₂As₂ layer may further develop degree of the
scatterings to be responsible for the weak localization. It should be
noted that the sharp drop of ρ at x=0.03 is not due to a bulk SC because
corresponding magnetic transition is absent in the χ vs T measurements.
Additional studies on high-quality single crystals if available would be
helpful to further address the role of Zn.

We considered a possibility that the drastic suppression of $T_{\rm c}$
in the Zn-doped samples is due to the carrier localization rather than
the pair breaking. Thus, we checked the present data on the point. We
found that the normal state ρ of the $T_{\rm c}$ suppressed
LaFe_(1 − x)Zn_(x)AsO_(0.85) (x=0.02) [Fig. 5(a)] is much smaller than
that of the superconducting sample LaFeAsO_(1 − δ) (δ=0.12,
$T_{\rm c}$=21 K) [Fig. 5(b)], even though both the data were taken from
the sintered polycrystalline forms. The entire systematic change in the
normal state ρ against compositions δ and x reasonably suggests that the
difference is substantial beyond the polycrystalline nature. The
comparison thus indicates that the electron localization picture is
unlikely for the large $T_{\rm c}$ decrease.

Figure 6 shows $C_{\rm p}/T$ vs T plots for the optimized SC sample
(LaFeAsO_(0.85)) and the Zn-doped sample
(LaFe_(0.95)Zn_(0.05)AsO_(0.85)). It appears that an expected anomaly at
$T_{\rm c}$ is unfortunately unclear in the plot. It is possible that
disorder regarding oxygen vacancy distribution causes inhomogeneous SC
states, much broadening the expected peak, and the broad anomaly is
masked by the lattice contributions. For instance, similar broad anomaly
was observed for the Co-doped LaFeAsO (Ref. [35]) and the oxygen vacant
LaFeAsO_(1 − δ)[36] The F-doped LaFeAsO having comparable $T_{\rm c}$
with LaFe_(0.95)Zn_(0.05)AsO_(0.85) actually does not show even a broad
anomaly at $T_{\rm c}$.[47]

We analyzed the low-temperature part of $C_{\rm p}$ (<15 K) of the
samples with and without the doped Zn. Using the approximate Debye model
C(T)/T=βT²+ γ, where β is a co

efficient and g is the Sommerfeld coefficient, we obtained β of 2.79(1)
x 10-4 J mol-1 K-4 and g of 2.0(1) mJ mol-1 K-2 for LaFeAsO0,85 by a fit
to the linear part (inset to Fig. 6). We obtained $T_{\rm D}$ (the Debye
temperature) of 299(1) K from β = 12 $\pi^{4}R^{7}/5T_{\rm D}^{3}$. The
g and $T_{\rm D}$ are indeed comparable with those of the Co- and
F-doped LaFeAsO superconductors.[35, 47] It is most noteworthy that the
Zn-doped sample shows additional anomaly at the low-temperature limit; a
broad upturn appears on cooling and $C_{\rm p}/T$ approaches to ∼12 mJ
mol-1 K-2 at the limit. Although we expected a Schottky anomaly in the
data because of possible Zn-induced magnetic moments in the Fe₂As₂
layer, the broad upturn was eventually observed instead. Although a
similar upturn was observed for the Zn-doped YBCO, which was discussed
using Kondo-screened moments,[48] our observation for the
low-temperature $C_{\rm p}$ of LaFe_(0.95Z)n_(0.05)AsO_(0.85) is not
well explained.

We attempted to measure the oxygen content of the samples
LaFe_(1 − x)Zn_(x)AsO_(0.85) (x ≈ 0.02) by a thermogravimetric method.
About 10 mg of each sample was fully oxidized at 1500 ∘ C in air for 24
h, followed by cooling slowly to room temperature. The final product was
identified to be LaFeO₃ in the XRD study, indicating that the following
reaction was proceeded: LaFeAsO_(1 − δ)+[4.5-(1-)]/2O₂→
LaFeO₃+0.5As₂O₃↑. The net oxygen content was calculated by monitoring
the weight loss. Assumed that Zn is fully evaporated in the heating, the
net oxygen content is within the range 0.83-0.85 per the formula unit,
being in good agreement with the nominal. Although uncertainty of the
exact Zn amount results in a possible error, it should be smaller than
0.014 per the formula unit. It thus appears that the oxygen content
variation unlikely accounts for the large $T_{\rm c}$ decrease.[34, 36]

Additionally, we studied the Mossbauer effect of the x = 0
($T_{\rm c}$=26 K) and 0.01 ($T_{\rm c}$=10 K) samples. As shown in
Figs. 1(b) and 1(c), both the spectra are nearly identical, suggesting
the Fe valence is unaltered between the two samples. In more details,
the hyperfine parameters and the IS values are the same and the
quadrupole splitting is negligibly small. The line width=0.265(5) mm/s,
IS(relative to Fe) =0.451(2) mm/s, QSP=0.090(3) mm/s for the x=0 sample,
and 0.277(5), 0.455(2), and 0.096(3), respectively, for the x= 0.01
sample. The oxygen content variation is again confirmed little.

Let us focus on the role of the doped Zn. The divalent Zn has the 3d¹⁰
configuration; the d orbital is fully occupied in contrast to Co²⁺ (3d⁷)
and Ni²⁺ (3d⁸), resulting in a highly localized nature. Indeed, the Zn
3d states are located at −8 to −6.5 eV far below the Fermi level in
LaZnAsO.[49] It is therefore reasonable that doped Zn in the Fe site
holds a strong localization nature and thus does not add itinerant
electrons into the Fe₂As₂ layer. It should be noted that the small
$T_{\rm c}$ suppression of the Co-doped LaFeAsO_(1 − δ)F_(δ) may be due
to weaker localization of Co.[33] Since the $T_{\rm c}$ suppression is
achieved by no more than 3 at.

Although our results well match with the theoretical predictions, those
firmly contradict the results of the Zn-doped studies on
LaFeAsO_(1 − δ)F_(0.1),[32] which concluded that the doped Zn does not
suppress the SC. It was stated in Ref. [32] that the SC remains almost
unperturbed or even enhanced by the Zn substitution (<10 at.

In contrast to the 1111 compound, the 122 compound Ba_(0.5)K_(0.5)Fe₂As₂
was recently found to be insensitive to the doped Zn;[53] the issue, how
the distinction of the sensitivity to the doped Zn between the 1111
system and the 122 system comes from, is left for future studies.

In summary, a large $T_{\rm c}$ decrease from the optimum $T_{\rm c}$ of
26 K was observed by a minimal amount of Zn (<3 at.

Figure 6: T dependence of $C_{\rm p}$ of LaFe_(1 − x)Zn_(x)AsO_(0.85) at
x=0.00 and 0.05. Inset shows an alternative plot. The solid line
indicates a fit to the data.

doped Zn likely plays a dominant role of effecting pair breaking due to
scatterings associated with the highly localized state of Zn in the
Fe₂As₂ layer. If this is true, the $T_{\rm c}$ suppression is consistent
with the prediction from the s₊-wave model. For further clarification of
the role of Zn, NMR measurements are in progress. Although the present
results indicate that the conventional s-wave model is highly unlikely
for LaFeAsO_(0.85), the s_(±)-wave model and the nodal d-wave model
remain equally possible. Although many theoretical studies suggested
that the s_(±)-wave model is much likely for the Fe pnictides, the
present nonmagnetic impurity study is, however, unable to judge which is
most likely.
