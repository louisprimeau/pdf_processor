###### Abstract

Magnetization and \({}^{63}\)Cu nuclear magnetic resonance-nuclear quadrupole resonance relaxation measurements are used to study the superconducting fluctuations in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{6+x}\) (YBCO) oriented powders. In optimally doped YBCO the fluctuating negative magnetization \(M_{cl}(H,T)\) is rather well described by an anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (GL) functional and the curves \(M_{fl}/\sqrt{H}\) cross at \(T_{c}\). In underdoped YBCO, instead, over a wide temperature range an anomalous diamagnetism is observed, stronger than in the optimally doped compound by about an order of magnitude. The field and temperature dependence of \(M_{fl}\) cannot be described either by an anisotropic GL functional or on the basis of scaling arguments. The anomalous diamagnetism is more pronounced in samples with a defined order in the Cu(1)O chains. The \({}^{63}\)Cu(2) relaxation rate shows little, if any, field dependence in the vicinity of the transition temperature \(T_{c}(H\!=\!0)\). It is argued how the results in the underdoped compounds can be accounted for by the presence of charge inhomogeneities, favored by chains ordering.

## I Introduction

The superconducting transition in conventional superconductors is rather well described by mean-field theories, essentially because in the coherence volume \(\xi^{3}\) a large number of pairs is present. On the contrary, in cuprate superconductors the small coherence length \(\xi\), the reduced carrier density, the marked anisotropy, and the high transition temperature \(T_{c}\) strongly enhance the superconducting fluctuations (SF). In a wide temperature range, which can extend up to 10 or 15 K above \(T_{c}\), a variety of phenomena related to SF (Refs. 1-3) can be detected by several experiments such as specific heat,[4] thermal expansion,[5] penetration depth,[6] conductivity,[7] and magnetization[8] measurements. Also nuclear magnetic resonance-nuclear quadrupole resonance (NMR)-(NQR) relaxation has been used to detect SF.[9, 10, 11, 12, 13] Recently the field dependence of the NMR relaxation rate \(W\) and of the Knight shift have been studied, by varying the magnetic field from 2 up to 24 T.[11, 12] Mitrovic _et al.[11]_ attributed the field dependence of \(W(H)\) to the corrections in the density of states (DOS) contribution to the spin-lattice relaxation. On the other hand, Gorny _et al.[13]_ have observed \(W(H)\) to be field independent, up to 14 T, from 150 K to 90 K, in a sample showing a decrease in \(1/T_{1}T\) starting around 110 K. More recently, also Zheng _et al.[14]_ found no effect of the magnetic field on \({}^{63}\)Cu\(W\) in the underdoped YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{8}\), above \(T_{c}\). An analysis of the role of SF in NMR experiments and of the field dependence of \(W\) has been recently carried out by Eschrig _et al._,[15] by extending the analitical approach of Randeria and Varlamov[16] to include short-wavelength and dynamical fluctuations.

Of particular interest is the role of SF in underdoped high-temperature superconductors. In fact, in these compounds one has the peculiar phenomena of the opening, at \(T^{\ast}\!\gg\!T_{c}\), of a spin gap (as evidenced by NMR and neutron scattering) and of a pseudogap (as indicated by transport and ARPES experiments),[17, 18, 19] These gaps, which are possibly connected,[20] have been variously related to SF of a particular character,[21, 22, 23]

In this paper magnetization and \({}^{63}\)Cu(2) NMR-NQR relaxation measurements in underdoped YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{6+x}\) (YBCO) are reported and compared with the ones in the optimally doped compound. The magnetization data yield information on the fluctuating diamagnetism (FD), while the nuclear relaxation rates \(W\) convey insights on the effects of SF on the **k**-integrated spin susceptibility in the zero-frequency limit.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II some basic equations describing SF and FD are recalled. After some experimental details (Sec. III), in Sec. IV the experimental findings and their analysis are presented, with emphasis on the effect of the field on \(W\) and on the behavior of the diamagnetic magnetization in chain-ordered underdoped YBCO. The main results and conclusions are summarized in Sec. V.

## II Theoretical framework and basic equations

Because of SF the number of Cooper pairs per unit volume, which is given by the average value of the square of the modulus of the order parameter \(\sqrt{\left\langle\left|\psi\right|^{2}\right\rangle}\), is different from zero above \(T_{c}\). In the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (GL) description[23] the collective amplitudes and the correspondent decay times of SF are given by

\[\left\langle\left|\psi_{\bf k}\right|^{2}\right\rangle\!=\!\frac{\left\langle \left|\psi_{0}\right|^{2}\right\rangle}{1+\xi^{2}k^{2}}\text{\ \ and\ \ }\tau_{\bf k}\!=\!\frac{\tau_{GL}}{1+\xi^{2}k^{2}},\] (1)

where \(\tau_{GL}\!=\!(\pi\hbar/8k_{B}T_{c})\,\epsilon^{-1}\) and \(\xi(T)\!=\!\xi(0)\,\epsilon^{-1/2}\), with \(\epsilon\!=\!(T\!-\!T_{c})/T_{c}\). \(\left\langle\left|\psi_{\bf k}\right|^{2}\right\rangle\) plays the role of the Fourier components of the average number of pairs per unit volume, while \(\tau_{\bf k}\) is the correspondent relaxation time.

Fluctuating pairs can give rise to a diamagnetic magnetization above \(T_{c}\). The diamagnetic magnetization \(M_{fl}\) in gen  eral is not linear in the field \(H\). The curves _M__f__l_ vs \(H\) and _M__f__l_ vs \(T\) can be tentatively analyzed by generalizing the Lawrence-Doniach model, using the free-energy functional [24, 25]

\[F\left[ \psi \right] = \sum\limits_{n}\ \int\ d\tau\left[ \left. a \middle| \psi_{n} \right|^{2} + \frac{b}{2} \middle| \psi_{n} \right|^{4} + \frac{\hbar^{2}}{4m_{1}}\left| \left| \nabla_{\text{l}} - \frac{2ie}{\hbar c} \right.\text{ }\text  For the NMR relaxation a good alignment of the \(\tilde{c}\) axis of the grains along the magnetic field is crucial to extract reliable values of \(W(H)\). The NMR satellite line, corresponding to the (\(\frac{1}{2}\!-\!\frac{3}{2}\)) transition, can be used to adjust the alignment and to monitor the spread in the orientation of the \(c\) axis, the resonance frequency being shifted at the first order by the term \(\epsilon\,Q\,V_{zz}(3\,\cos^{2}\theta-1)/h\), due to the quadrupole interaction (\(\theta\) angle of the \(\tilde{c}\) axis with the field). From the width of the spectrum [Fig. 1(a)] the spread in the orientation of the \(c\) axis appears within about two degrees.

The recovery law for the NMR satellite transition is

\[y(t) = 0.5\,\exp(-\,12Wt)+0.4\,\exp(-\,6\,Wt)\] (8) \[+ 0.1\,\exp(-\,2Wt)\,.\]

This formula fits the experimental data [Fig. 1(b)] and indicates that the estimate of \(2\,W\) is not affected by other resonance lines.

The magnetization has been measured by means of a Metronique Ingegnerie superconducting quantum interface device (SQUID) magnetometer, on decreasing the temperature at constant field and, at selected temperatures, by varying \(H\). The paramagnetic contribution to \(M\) was obtained from \(M\) vs \(H\) at \(T\!\!\approx\!\!110\,\)K, where practically no fluctuating magnetization is present. Then \(M_{fl}\) was derived, accounting for an intrinsic Pauli-like paramagnetic term as well as for a small contribution from paramagnetic impurities. The paramagnetic susceptibility turns out to be a little temperature dependent around \(T_{c}\) and this dependence will be neglected in discussing the much stronger diamagnetic term.

In optimally doped YBCO the measurements have been carried out to confirm the results recently obtained in single crystals by other authors.[24, 28, 30, 33] The isothermal magnetization curves are satisfactorily described on the basis of the anisotropic GL functional [Eq. (2)], for \(\epsilon\!\approx\!\!4\!\times\!10^{-2}\). Only close to \(T_{c}\) and for \(H\!\!\approx\!\!1\,\)T an observable departure is detected, indicating crossover to a region of non-Gaussian SF, in agreement with recent thermal expansion measurements.[5] The \(M_{fl}\) vs \(T\) curves cross at \(T_{c}(0)\) when \(M_{fl}\) is scaled by \(\langle\overline{H}\rangle\), as expected for moderate anisotropy.[28]

## IV Results and Analysis

Let us first comment on the data in optimally doped YBCO [Fig. 2(a)]. The comparison between the NMR and NMR W's has been already discussed in previous papers.[9, 10] Here we only add a few comments motivated by more recents works[11, 34, 13] involving the remarkable aspect of the field dependence.

The NQR \(W\) is compared to Eq. (7), using the values[2]

\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline  & YBCO & & YBCO & \\  & optimally doped & & & underdoped \\ \cline{3-5}  & & Disordered & & Chain-ordered \\ \hline \(T_{c}(0)\) & 91.1\(\pm\) 0.4 K & 63.3\(\pm\) 0.4 K & 64.5\(\pm\) 0.4 K & 64.2\(\pm\) 0.4 K \\ \(T_{c}(H\!\!=\!6\,\)T) & 87\(\pm\) 0.5 K & 60\(\pm\) 1 K & & \\ \(T_{c}(H\!\!=\!9.4\,\)T) & & 55\(\pm\) 1 & 54\(\pm\) 1 K & \\ \(\left[\frac{\partial H_{c2}}{\partial T}\right]_{T_{c0}}\) & \(-\) 1.2\(\pm\) 0.2 & \(-\)1.05 & \(-\)1.1\(\pm\) 0.2 & \(-\)1.0\(\pm\) 0.1 \\ \(H_{c2}(T\!\!\to\!\!0)\) & \(\mathbf{H}\!\!\parallel\!\mathbf{c}\) & 100\(\pm\) 20 T & \(\sim\)70 T & \(\sim\)65 T & \\ \(H_{c2}(T\!\  \(\tau\!=\!10^{-14}\) s, \(\tau_{\phi}\!=\!2.10^{-13}\) s, and a dephasing time parameter \(\gamma_{\phi}\!=\!0.2\). A quantitative fitting is inhibited by the fact that the background contribution to \(W\) does not follow the Korringa law, in view of correlation effects among carriers [17]. A firm deduction, however, is that an anisotropy parameter \(r\!\neq\!0\) (i.e., a crossover to a 3D regime) is required to avoid unrealistic values [2D line in Fig. 2(a)] as indicated also by magnetization measurements (see later on).

Mitrovic _et al._[11] have discussed the field dependence of \(T_{1}\) in terms of quenching of the DOS term only, by resorting to the theory of Eschrig _et al._[15]. The field dependence of the SF contribution to the relaxation rate is a delicate issue, because of the nontrivial interplay of many parameters that include reduced temperature \(\epsilon\), reduced field \(\beta\!=\!2H/H_{c2}\), anisotropy parameter \(r\), and elastic and phase-breaking times \(\tau\) and \(\tau_{\phi}\). Eschrig _et al._[15] have extended the analytical approach [16] by taking into account arbitrary values of \((k_{B}T\tau\!/\hbar)\), short-wave fluctuations, and dynamical fluctuations. The price of this generalization is the restriction to a 2D spectrum of SF fluctuations. In view of our experimental findings the analysis of the field effect in a purely 2D framework is questionable. On the other hand, a reexamination of the field effect for a layered system is now possible by applying the method of the DOS term regularization devised by Buzdin and Varlamov [34], which has indicated how the divergences can be treated. Since the dynamical fluctuations could be relevant only for fields of the order of \(H_{c2}\), up to 20\(-\)30 T the fluctuations can be safely treated in the nearly static limit. The field dependence for weak fields (\(\beta\!\ll\!\epsilon\)) turns out to be [35]

\[W(\beta\!\ll\!\epsilon)-W(0,\epsilon) = W^{(0)}\frac{\hbar}{24E_{F}\tau}\bigg{\{}\kappa(T\tau)\] (9) \[-\frac{\pi}{8\,\gamma_{\phi}}\bigg{\}}\frac{\epsilon+r/2}{\big{[} \epsilon(\epsilon+r)\big{]}^{3/2}}\,\beta^{2},\]

where

\[\kappa(T\tau) = \frac{7\,\zeta(3)}{\pi}\frac{1}{4\,\pi T\tau\{\psi(1/2)-\  elsewhere.[35] Here we only remark that the results in strong fields (\(\beta\!\!\approx\!0.2\)) from Mitrovic _et al.[11]_ cannot be justified on the basis of Eq. (9).

As regards the magnetization measurements in optimally doped YBCO, as already mentioned, our data indicate a 3D regime crossing from Gaussian to critical fluctuations close to \(T_{c}\) . The value of \(\gamma_{dyn}m_{\{\infty\}}(\infty)\) (Ref. [28]) at the crossing point of the curves \(M_{fl}/\langle H\rangle\) vs \(T\) turns out around \(-1.5\), corresponding to an anisotropy factor \(\gamma_{cur}\!=\!4.5\). A collapse onto a common function is obtained when \(M_{fl}/\sqrt{H}T\) is plotted as a function of \(\epsilon/H^{0.747}\). The collapse fails in magnetic fields less than about 0.3 T. A small-field departure from the universal function has been already observed in underdoped compounds,[30] but no mention about it is found in the literature for optimally doped YBCO.

In the underdoped compounds a marked enhancement of the fluctuating magnetization is observed (Figs. 3 and 4). In Fig. 4 the susceptibility, defined as \(M/H\) for \(H\!=\!0.02\,\Upsilon\), is plotted. The inset is a blowup of the results around the temperature where reversing of the sign of the magnetization occurs. The susceptibilities for chain-ordered and chain-disordered underdoped samples are compared with the one in optimally doped YBCO in Fig. 5.

In underdoped YBCO the magnetization curves dramatically depart from the ones expected on the basis of Eq. (2) and numerical derivative. The curves \(M_{fl}\) vs \(T\) do not cross at any temperature. No collapse on a common function is found for \(M_{fl}/\sqrt{H}\) or for \(M_{fl}\) as a function of \(\epsilon/H^{1/2\nu}\) (Fig. 6). These anomalies are more manifested in the chain-ordered compound, as it can be realized from the peculiar shape of the isothermal magnetization vs \(H\) (Fig. 7). One could remark that a fraction of a few percent of nonpercolating local superconducting regions can account for the absolute value of the diamagnetic susceptibility and for the shape of the magnetization curves. A trivial chemical inhomogeneity could be suspected. The fact that the anomalous diamagnetism has been observed in three samples differently prepared and since it is strongly enhanced in the chain-ordered ones, supports the intrinsic origin of the phenomenon. Recent theories[36; 37] have discussed how a distribution of local superconducting temperatures, related to charge inhomogeneities, can cause anomalous diamagnetic effects.

Mesoscopic charge inhomogeneities have been predicted on the basis of various theoretical approaches.[22; 39] In underdoped compounds one could expect the occurrence of preformed Cooper pairs causing "local" superconductivity without long-range phase coherence. An inhomogeneous distribution of carriers, on a mesoscopic scale, is supported by \(ab\) plane optical conductivity[38] and it is the basic ingredient of the stripes model.[40] Since the anomalous diamagnetism is

In the inset the results for \(H_{c2}\) around \(T_{c}\) are shown (estimated experimental error \(\approx 2\%\)). The solid lines indicate the procedure to evaluate \(T_{c}(H)\) and \(T_{c}(0)\).

  enhanced in chain-ordered underdoped YBCO one is tempted to relate it to the presence of stripes. The insurgence of phase coherence among adjacent charge-rich regions can qualitatively be expected to yield strong screening above the bulk superconducting temperature.[36, 37, 41] Therefore, one could phenomenologically describe the role of SF in underdoped compounds, as follows. At \(T\)\(\gg\)\(T_{c}\) , just below \(T^{*}\), fluctuating pairs are formed, without long-range phase coherence. Below \(T_{SF}\) , about 20\(-\)30 K above \(T_{c}\) , phase coherence among adjacent charge-rich drops[37] start to develop, yielding the formation of superconducting loops with strong screening and causing the onset of the anomalous diamagnetism. Close to \(T_{c}\) , SF of GL character occurs and long-range phase coherence sets in.

## V V. Summarizing remarks and conclusions

By combining magnetization and NMR-NQR relaxation measurements, an attempt has been made to clarify the role of superconducting fluctuations and of fluctuating diamagnetism in underdoped YBCO, _vis-a-vis_ the optimally doped compound. In the latter case the fluctuations above \(T_{c}\) are rather well described by an anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (GL) functional and by scaling arguments for slightly anisotropic systems. A breakdown of the Gaussian approximation for small magnetic fields has been observed close to \(T_{c}\) . The \({}^{63}\)Cu relaxation rates \(W\) around \(T_{c}\) do not show a noticeable field dependence. One cannot rule out the presence of a MT contribution, and then of a small \(s\)-wave component in the spectrum of the fluctuations, which should be sample dependent in view of the role of impurities in the pair-breaking mechanisms. In underdoped YBCO an anomalous diamagne

  tism is observed, on a large temperature range. The diamagnetic susceptibility at \(T_{c}\) is about an order of magnitude larger than the one in the optimally doped sample and the isothermal magnetization curves cannot be described by the anisotropic GL functional. The data cannot be fit by a scaling function of the form \(\epsilon/H^{1/2\nu}\). The anomalies are more marked in the chain-ordered samples. \({}^{63}\)Cu NQR \(W\) in the underdoped YBCO almost coincide with the NMR ones at \(H\!=\!9.4\,\)T, in agreement with a theoretical estimate of the effect of the magnetic field. Another conclusion drawn from the field and temperature dependences of the \({}^{63}\)Cu relaxation rate is that the spin gap does not depend on the magnetic field and that the behavior of the spin susceptibility for \(T\)\(\gg\)\(T_{c}\) cannot be ascribed to SF of GL character.

The fluctuating diamagnetism observed in underdoped YBCO can be phenomenologically accounted for by the presence of charge inhomogeneities at mesoscopic level. The anomalies in the magnetization curves can be attributed to "locally superconducting"' nonpercolating drops, present above the bulk \(T_{c}\) and favored by chain ordering.
