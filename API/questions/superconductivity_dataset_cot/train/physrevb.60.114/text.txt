###### Abstract

The superconducting coherence length \(\xi\) of Zn- or Ni-doped YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{6.9}\) single crystals was measured through the diamagnetic susceptibility in the reversible region, and through the resistivity in the mixed state. Upon impurity doping, \(\xi\) increases along both the in- and out-of-plane directions, which suggests that the doped impurities act as pair breakers. The in-plane \(\xi\) is well explained by the pair-breaking theory of \(d\)-wave superconductivity. On the other hand, the increase of the out-of-plane \(\xi\) is larger than the theoretical prediction, which might indicate that the interplane coupling of the order parameter is modified by the impurities.

Impurity effects in high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates (HTSC's) have long been a subject of intense debate.[1] In the beginning, that non-magnetic Zn\({}^{2+}\) suppresses the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) as much as (or even more effectively than) magnetic Ni\({}^{2+}\) was a mystery. Considering that increasing evidence of the \(d\)-wave superconductivity in HTSC's, we can now understand it in terms of the pair-breaking effect in anisotropic superconductivity. However, there is still no consensus on how the impurity breaks the superconducting pair. According to Sun and Maki,[2] a standard treatment of impurity scattering (as Abrikosov and Gor'kov did in \(s\)-wave superconductivity) well explains the \(T_{c}\) reduction, on the assumption that the order parameter is suppressed uniformly in space by impurities. On the other hand, Uemura[3] has proposed that the order parameter becomes spatially inhomogeneous by impurity doping, and its amplitude is fully suppressed near the impurities.

To address this issue, it will be crucial how the superconducting coherence length \(\xi\) changes with impurities. In particular, since the in-plane superconductivity of HTSC is in the clean limit,[4] the in-plane coherence length \(\xi_{ab}\) is written as \(\xi_{ab}\)\(\sim\)\(\hbar\upsilon_{F}^{ab}/\Delta\), where \(\upsilon_{F}^{ab}\) and \(\Delta\) are the in-plane Fermi velocity and the (maximum) superconducting gap. Accordingly \(\xi_{ab}\) can be a measure of \(\Delta\). Semba, Matsuda and Ishii[5] have evaluated the Zn-doping effects on \(\xi\) of YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{6.9}\) crystals by fitting the mixed-state resistivity with the superconducting fluctuation theory.[6] With the same technique, Watanabe and Matsuda[7] have studied the Co-doped Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\). In these works, \(\xi\) is obtained through complicated fitting, and it is desirable to obtain \(\xi\) in a simpler way.

Here we report on the measurements and analyses of the anisotropic coherence lengths of Zn- or Ni-doped YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{6.9}\) (YBCO) crystals prepared by a crystal-pulling technique. The coherence lengths are evaluated through both the diamagnetic susceptibility and the mixed-state resistivity. Susceptibility is more advantageous than resistivity, because (i) it is a thermodynamic quantity reflecting the bulk nature, (ii) the transition temperature \(T_{c}(H)\) is well defined, and (iii) no fitting is necessary to obtain \(\xi\) through \(T_{c}(H)\).[8] A large size of our crystals enables us to measure it precisely in all directions. The measured \(\xi\) is increased with impurities along both the in- and out-of-plane directions. While the increase of \(\xi_{ab}\) is quantitatively explained by the theory of Sun and Maki,[2] the out-of-plane coherence length \(\xi_{c}\) exhibits an anomalously large increase beyond the theoretical prediction.

We prepared single crystals of YBa\({}_{2}\)(Cu\({}_{1-x}\)\(M_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{y}\) with \(x\)\(=\)\(0.004\), \(0.006\) for Zn, \(x\)\(=\)\(0.010\) for Ni, and \(x\)\(=\)\(0\) (pure YBCO) by the solute rich liquid crystal pulling (SRLCP) method.[9] After initial growth of pure YBCO on MgO single crystal, an appropriate amount of substituents, 99.99% grade ZnO or NiO, was charged to the SRLCP molten. The grown crystals' compositions were analyzed by the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis. Within the detection limit of ICP analysis, no undesirable impurity was detected. Each crystal (typical size of 10\(\times\)10 mm\({}^{2}\) in the \(ab\) plane and 5 mm in the \(c\) axis) was cut into a rectangular shape and annealed in flowing O\({}_{2}\) for 200 h at 500 degC, and terminated with rapid quench to room temperature. Thus obtained samples are optimally doped with twinned structure. By Zn or Ni doping, \(T_{c}\) of 93 K for pure YBCO is suppressed down to 85 K for Zn\(=\)\(0.4\)%, 82 K for Zn\(=\)\(0.6\)%, and 87 K for Ni\(=\)\(1.0\)%. These \(T_{c}\) reductions are consistent with the literature,[1] and warrant the uniform substitutions in these crystals. Sharp transitions (\(\Delta T_{c}\)\(\sim\)1 K) also support the crystal qualities.

The magnetization of the samples were measured by a commercial superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (QD-MPMS-XL7), and magnetic field \(H\) was applied for \(H\)\(\parallel\)\(c\) and \(H\)\(\perp\)\(c\) configurations up to 7 T. In-plane resistivity \(\rho_{ab}\) was measured by a standard four-terminal method. Typical sampling current density was around 5 A/cm\({}^{2}\), and \(H\) was applied parallel to the \(c\) axis of the samples. All the resistivity measurements were done in the field-cooling condition.

Typical magnetizations in 7 T are shown in Fig. 1(a) for \(H\|c\), and in Fig. 1(b) for \(H\bot\,c\). Note that the data are taken in both cooling from \(T_{c}\) and warming to \(T_{c}\) , to specify the temperature range for the reversible magnetization. The upper panels are the results of pure YBCO and the lower ones for Zn\(=0.6\%\) doped YBCO. The critical temperature in magnetic field \(T_{c}(H)\) is evaluated from the cross point of the linear slope of the reversible magnetization curve below \(T_{c}\) and the normal state basal line.[8] Reflecting the two-dimensional nature, the two samples show a larger \(T_{c}(0)\)\(-\,T_{c}(H)\) for \(H\|c\) than for \(H\bot\,c\). Since \(\xi\) is proportional to \(|dH_{c2}/dT|\), this indicates that \(\xi_{c}\) is shorter than \(\xi_{ab}\) . It should be noted that \(T_{c}(0)\)-\(T_{c}(H)\) is larger in Zn doped YBCO than in pure YBCO, which means that Zn doping increases \(\xi\).

In Fig. 2, we plotted \(T_{c}(H)\) for all the samples in the \(H\)-\(T\) diagram, from which \(H_{c2}(T)\) can be evaluated. Considering that \(H_{c2}(T)\) for each sample is roughly linear in \(T\), we can apply the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg formula given as[10]

\[H_{c2}(0)=0.7\frac{\partial H_{c2}(T)}{\partial T}\Bigg{|}_{T=T_{c}}\,T_{c}\,.\]

Then, \(\xi\) is evaluated through the relations of \(H_{c2}(0)\)\(=\,\)\(\phi_{0}/2\pi\xi_{ab}^{2}\) for \(H\|c\), and \(H_{c2}(0)\)\(=\,\)\(\phi_{0}/2\pi\xi_{ab}\xi_{c}\) for \(H\bot\,c\), where \(\phi_{0}

  to emphasize that Zn or Ni doping does not change \(v_{F}^{ab}\) or the carrier density.[1] Hence the relative change of 1/\(\xi_{ab}\) with impurities is reduced to the relative change of \(\Delta\). We plot \(\xi_{0}/\xi\) in Fig. 3(b), where \(\xi_{0}\) is \(\xi\) for pure YBCO. Note that \(\xi_{abb}/\xi_{ab}\) is in excellent agreement with the theoretical calculation of \(\Delta/\Delta_{0}\) shown by the dashed line (\(\Delta_{0}\) is \(\Delta\) for pure YBCO).[2] We thus conclude that the suppression of the order parameter by impurities is quantitatively understood by Ref. [2].

The successful explanation by Ref. [2] seems to disagree with the strong suppression of the superconducting pair density by Zn doping, as observed in \(\mu\)SR (Ref. [3]) or infrared conductivity.[11] We claim that these experiments do not contradict themselves; they are done in different parts of the _H-T_ diagram. Since the present study is the measurement near \(H_{c2}\), the order parameter is small enough to be homogeneous in space, which justifies the treatment of 'averaging" the impurity scattering. At low temperatures (and _H_\(\ll\)\(H_{c2}\)) where the amplitude of the order parameter fully grows, we have to consider two cases depending on the coherence volume \(\xi_{ab}^{2}\xi_{c}\). When \(\xi_{ab}^{2}\xi_{c}\) is small enough to pay negligible cost to break the superconductivity locally, the superconductivity is likely to be suppressed near impurities. On the contrary, when \(\xi_{ab}^{2}\xi_{c}\) is large, the order parameter favors to be uniform. Perhaps HTSC's are the former case, and superconductivity is robust in spite of a large amount of unpaired carriers induced by impurities.[11] We therefore propose that the coherence volume determines how to suppress the superconductivity at \(T\!=\!0\), which should be further clarified both experimentally and theoretically.

To verify the rapid increase of \(\xi_{c}\) by impurities, we measured the mixed-state resistivity. Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of \(\rho_{ab}\) for \(H\|_{C}\) for the Zn = 0.6% doped YBCO. Using the superconducting fluctuation theory,[6] we successfully fit the resistive transition, as the dotted curves in Fig. 4. Because of the pinning effect, the lower resistivity curves at lower temperatures are out of the applicable region of the theory. The coherence lengths estimated by fitting \(\rho_{ab}\) qualitatively agree with the susceptibility measurement, as listed in Table 1. We note that \(\xi\) obtained from the resistivity is well consistent with Ref. [5].

In conventional superconductors including superconducting multilayers, all the anisotropic properties are attributed to the anisotropic effective mass.[12] So far YBCO has been believed to be the case, because it is the least anisotropic HTSC.[13] In this case the coherence-length ratio \(\xi_{ab}/\xi_{c}\) would be independent of impurities. The measured \(\xi_{ab}/\xi_{c}\) is, however, strongly dependent on impurities, as shown in Fig. 5. An alternative approach is to introduce an interplane coupling such as the Josephson junction. As we have pointed out in our previous papers, the electronic states and charge dynamics of YBCO are essentially two dimensional, and their anisotropy cannot be ascribed only to the effective mass.[14] The anomaly in \(\xi_{c}\) might be another piece of the evidence. In this scenario, the increase of \(\xi_{c}\) suggests that the interplane coupling is increased upon impurity doping. Panagopoulos _et al.[15]_ have found that the penetration depth becomes more isotropic with Zn doping, which they ascribed to the enhancement of the interplane coupling by Zn doping.

In summary, we have successfully grown the Zn- or Ni-doped YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{6.9}\) single crystals by the crystal pulling method and examined the impurity effects on the coherence length and its anisotropy ratio. The observed impurity dependence of the in-plane coherence length is in an excellent agreement with the prediction of the pair-breaking theory in the \(d\)-wave superconductivity. However, the rapid increase in the out-of-plane coherence length cannot be explained by the

The dotted curves are calculated from fluctuation theory (Ref. [6]). The parameters used for fitting are as follows. The in-plane coherence length \(\xi_{ab}\!=\!12\) Å, the out-of-plane coherence length \(\xi_{c}\!=\!3\) Å , the critical temperature \(T_{c}\!=\!82\) K, the specific-heat jump \(\Delta\)\(C\) = 47.2 mJ/cm\({}^{3}\)K, the conversion factor \(C\!=\!1.9\), and the conduction layer spacing \(s\!=\!11.7\) Å.
