###### Abstract

The superconducting transition temperature \(T_{\epsilon}\) has been measured for amorphous \(T_{5}T_{9}\) alloys (where \(T_{5}\) - Nb or Ta, \(T_{9}\) - Rh or Ir) as a function of composition. Nb and Ta dominated the \(T_{\epsilon}\) behavior with \(T_{\epsilon}\) for Nb alloys \(\approx\) 4.8\(-\)5.1 K and \(T_{\epsilon}\) for Ta alloys \(\approx\) 3.1\(-\)3.3 K. Changing the average group number by varying the \(T_{5}/T_{9}\) ratio had little effect on \(T_{\epsilon}\) within the \(\sim\) 10 at. % range of composition in which the amorphous alloys form. \(T_{\epsilon}\) decreased approximately linearly with \(x\) for (Nb\({}_{1-x}\)Ta\({}_{x}\))\({}_{55}\)Rh\({}_{45}\) and (Nb\({}_{1-x}\)Ta\({}_{x}\))\({}_{55}\)Ir\({}_{45}\). The electrical resistivity \(\rho_{n}\) and the upper critical field \(B_{\epsilon 2}\) were measured as functions of temperature. The Sommerfeld constant \(\gamma\) was calculated from \(\rho_{n}\) and \(dB_{\epsilon 2}/dT|_{T_{\epsilon}}\) using the Ginzburg-Landau-Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory. The Debye temperature \(\Theta_{D}\) was calculated from measurements of Young's modulus. The above parameters allowed calculations to be made of \(N(E_{F})\), the density of electronic states at the Fermi level, and \(\lambda\), the electron-phonon coupling constant. It was found that \(\lambda\) more accurately reflected the \(T_{\epsilon}\) behavior than did \(N(E_{F})\) and that both electronic and phonon contributions had to be considered in the determination of \(\lambda\).

## I Introduction

The first amorphous superconducting alloy obtained by rapid quenching from the liquid state, La\({}_{80}\)Au\({}_{20}\), was reported in 1975.[1] Since then several dozen new liquid-quenched amorphous alloys have been discovered[2, 3, 4] which have added information to the field of amorphous superconductivity, first studied in vapor-quenched systems by Buckel and Hilsch.[5] Liquid-quenched alloys, which are typically 25\(-\)50 \(\mu\)m in thickness, provide bulk samples which are stable at room temperature and above, and thus can facilitate a variety of superconducting and physical property measurements not easily accomplished on thin films. Such measurements can also give information on the electronic structure of the amorphous alloys and contribute to the understanding of their formation and stability. Unfortunately, many of the transition-metal systems of interest can only be made amorphous from the liquid state by the addition of nontransition (metalloid) elements such as B, C, P, or Si. The presence of these metalloids complicates the electronic structure and the systematics of superconductivity in amorphous transition-metal alloys. Recently, a series of transition-metal-transition-metal binary alloys which consist of combinations of elements from column 5 and column 9 of the periodic table; i.e., Nb, Ta with Rh, Ir have been prepared in the amorphous form by quenching from the liquid. The alloys have been termed \(T_{5}T_{9}\) alloys.[6] These amorphous alloys, produced by rapid quenching of the liquids are formed at compositions centered around approximately 45 at. % of the \(T_{9}\) component, which corresponds to the composition where a eutectic is found in the equilibrium phase diagram.[7] The amorphous alloys fall at electron-to-atom ratios (\(e/a\)), as determined by the average group number in the periodic table, of \(\sim\) 6.6 to 7.0, a relatively favorable \(e/a\) for the occurrence of superconductivity in amorphous 4\(d\) and 5\(d\) transition metals.[8] However, since the components of the \(T_{5}T_{9}\) alloys are not near neighbors in the periodic table it is expected that the superconducting transition temperatures \(T_{\epsilon}\) will fall below the curve of maximum \(T_{\epsilon}\) vs \(e/a\) determined by Collver and Hammond[8, 9] on amorphous transition metals quenched from the vapor state. Collver and Hammond find that the degradation of \(T_{\epsilon}\) below their composite maximum \(T_{\epsilon}\) vs \(e/a\) curve is proportional to the difference in atomic number of the components.

One of the amorphous \(T_{5}T_{9}\) alloys, Nb\({}_{55}\)Rh\({}_{45}\), has been studied previously[10] with regard to its superconductivity and found to be superconducting below 4.7 K. No superconductivity measurements have been reported on the other amorphous alloys of this series.

In this paper we report superconductivity measurements of the \(T_{5}T_{9}\) alloys as a function of composition, varying both \(e/a\) and the composition of the \(T_{5}\) component. Measurements of \(T_{\epsilon}\), the upper critical field \(H_{\epsilon 2}(T)\), and the normal-state resistivity \(\rho_{n}\)  allowed us to calculate the electronic coefficient of low-temperature specific-heat capacity, g. Measurements of Young's modulus provided data for calculation of the Debye temperature, Th_D_. The values of Th_D_ and \(T_{c}\) were then used to calculate the electron-phonon coupling constant, l. With g, and l, values of the density of electronic states at the Fermi level \(N\) (\(E_{F}\)) were calculated. The variation of \(T_{c}\) with \(N\) (\(E_{F}\)) and l, and the variation of an index of amorphous phase stability with \(N\) (\(E_{F}\)) are presented and discussed.

## II Experimental

### Sample preparation

The amorphous _T__S__T_9 alloys were prepared from high-purity Nb, Ta, Ir, and Rh. The Nb, Ta, and Ir were in the form of electron-beam melted rod; the Rh in the form of powder. Alloy buttons, ~ 3 g in weight, were made by arc melting the constituents together on a copper hearth in a partial pressure of purified argon. The buttons were turned over and remelted at least six times to maximize homogeneity. Where composition was to be varied in a given system, e.g., (Nb1-Ta_T_a_)3S_Rh_45, a master alloy, weighing approximately 10 g, was prepared first, sectioned, and the appropriate additions made. The alloys were broken into small sections and ~ 30-mg pieces were selected to be rapidly quenched from the melt. The rapid quenching was carried out in arc-hammer furnaces6 at Northeastern University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Hammer velocities of ~ 5-6 m/s were used and the resulting foils obtained were typically 1 cm in diameter and 20-30 _m_m thick. A list of the alloys used in this study is given in Table I.

### Sample characterization

X-ray diffraction patterns were made on all samples in order to determine their structure. All samples were surveyed in a Norelco vertical x-ray diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu _K_a radiation. Selected samples were examined in more detail, again using Cu _K_a radiation but with a diffracted beam monochromator in the form of a graphite crystal.

The temperatures at which the amorphous phase transforms to a crystalline phase, or phases on heating, the crystallization temperature \(T_{x}\) were determined by differential thermal analysis, DTA. The DTA measurements were performed in a Mettler thermoanalyzer in an atmosphere of flowing purified argon at a heating rate of 10 degC/min. Pure platinum metal was used as the standard and equal weights of platinum standard and sample were used (~ 30 mg). The DTA apparatus calibration was checked by determining the melting points of pure Ag, Cu, and Al. Agreement of 1-2 degC was obtained with the accepted values.

### Low-temperature measurements

Electrical resistance was measured by the four-probe technique using pressure-voltage contacts 4.876 mm apart on samples 8 to 10 mm long. The samples

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} Alloy & Structurea & Alloy & Structurea \\ Nb6Rh40 & \(a\) + \(c\) & Ta59Rh41 & \(a\) + \(c\) \\ Nb55Rh45 & \(a\) & Ta55Rh45 & \(a\) \\ Nb50Rh50 & \(a\) + \(c\) & Ta51Rh49 & \(a\) \\ Nb571\(t\)43 & \(a\) & Ta60Ir40 & \(a\) \\ Nb551\(t\)45 & \(a\) & Ta53Ir44.5 & \(a\) \\ Nb531\(t\)47 & \(a\) & Ta53Ir45 & \(a\) \\ Nb50Ir50 & \(a\) + \(c\) & Ta53Ir50 & \(a\) \\ Nb48Ir52 & \(c\) & (Nb1-Ta_T_a_)5  were cut from the quenched disks by mounting the disks in wax and using a diamond slitting saw positioned by a micrometer. The samples were typically 8-10 mm long, 1.0 to 1.3 mm wide, and 25 to 30 mm thick. The chief source of error in determining the form factor for calculating resistivity from the resistance measurements comes from the thickness measurements. The average value of resistivity and the standard deviation were estimated for alloys where more than one sample was made and measured. The electrical resistance was measured from room temperature down through the superconducting transition temperature. A Chromel-Au-0.07 at.% Fe thermocouple was used as a temperature probe over the entire temperature range. Near \(T_{c}\), a calibrated Ge resistance thermometer was employed to give a more precise measurement of \(T_{c}\). A Keithley million-liohmmeter model 503 was used for the resistance measurements.

\(T_{c}\) was measured both resistively, as described above, and by an ac susceptibility method. Good agreement was observed between results obtained by both techniques. A calibrated Ge thermometer was used as a temperature probe in the ac susceptibility method and a pure lead sample was kept in one of the measuring coils, its \(T_{c}\) serving as an internal calibration check. The pressure above the helium bath was reduced to obtain temperatures below 4.2 K and the vapor pressure of the helium provided another temperature comparison with the Ge thermometer calibration. Differences of less than 10 mK were always observed between the two temperature measurements.

The upper critical field _H__c_2 was measured as a function of temperature by the resistive technique. A temperature was set, e.g., by controlling the helium vapor pressure, and the magnetic field produced by a 7-T superconducting solenoid was swept.

### Elastic constant measurements

Young's modulus was measured on Nb5SRh45, Nb5SIr45, Ta55Rh45, and Ta55Ir45 by the technique of impulse-induced resonance at Northeastern University. This technique has been described recently11 and shown to be accurate to 0.4% in Young's modulus for samples similar to those used in the present work.

## III Discussion of experimental results

### Structure

The results of the x-ray diffraction measurements on all alloys are summarized in Table 1. Alloys for which no Bragg peaks could be resolved are labeled \(a\) while those for which some crystalline peaks were observed are labeled \(a\) + \(c\). The amorphous phase was always the majority phase (with the exception of Nb4SIr52 which was mostly crystalline and labeled _c_). An example of the x-ray diffraction results is presented in Fig. 1 for a Ta55Ir45 alloy where the intensity is plotted against the scattering angle 2th. The major features of this diffraction pattern were identical for all the amorphous alloys studied. The second peak exhibits a definite splitting. The scattering vector \(K\) = 4\(p\) sin_th_l was calculated with l the x-ray wavelength (Cu _K_a_). The first maximum in intensity, \(I\) (_K_) occurred at \(K\) = 27.7 nm-1 (2.77 A-1) for all alloys, to within experimental accuracy, giving a value for the average nearest-neighbor distance (from either the Ehrenfest formula12 or the conventional approximation13 of \(d\) = 0.278 nm (2.78 A). The similarity of the diffraction patterns for these alloys is understandable since the atomic diameters of Nb and Ta are nearly identical and those for Rh and Ir differ by only ~1%. It was found that the ability to produce a completely amorphous sample decreased on either side of the composition at which the _e_/_a_ = 6.8. This composition is the eutectic composition. At this _e_/_a_ it was observed that the ease of glass formation, in terms of the hammer velocity (quench rate) required to produce the completely amorphous structure, increased in the order Nb5SRh45, Ta55Rh45, Nb5SIr45, Ta55Ir45. Only the very fastest hammer speeds produced completely amorphous Nb5SRh45. This trend is also reflected in the relative stability of the amorphous phase and will be discussed later in this paper.

Figure 1: Diffracted intensity vs scattering angle for Ta55Ir45.

  

### Crystallization temperatures

The crystallization temperatures \(T_{x}\), determined by DTA are listed in Table 2 for the four \(T_{5}T_{9}\) amorphous alloys. \(T_{x}\) values determined by changes in electrical resistance by Davis _et al._14 are also listed in Table 2. Since \(T_{x}\) is a kinetic parameter dependent on heating rate, comparisons should be made for \(T_{x}\) values determined at constant heating rate. The variation of \(T_{x}\) with heating rate is shown in Fig. 2 for the Ta55Ir45 alloy, along with the \(T_{x}\) value from Davis _et al._ If the heating rate variations are taken into account then the present data agree with those of Davis _et al._ to within 10\(-\)15 K. These differences may be attributed to compositional variations, unresolved crystalline nucleation sites, etc. The order for \(T_{x}\) [i.e., \(T_{x}\)(Ta55Ir45) \(>T_{x}\)(Nb55Ir45) \(>T_{x}\)(Ta55Rh45) \(>T_{x}\)(Nb55Rh45)] in the \(T_{x}\)\(T_{9}\) alloys was identical in the two experiments.

### Superconducting transition temperatures

\(T_{c}\) is plotted against \(e/a\) in Fig. 3 for the four \(T_{5}T_{9}\) alloy systems. There would appear to be very little variation of \(T_{c}\) with \(e/a\) in these amorphous alloys although there is an indication of a small increase of \(T_{c}\) with decreasing \(e/a\). This later trend in \(T_{c}\) vs \(e/a\) is consistent with the observations of Collver and Hammond8 on vapor-deposited amorphous transition-metal alloys. The \(T_{c}\) data for the \(T_{5}T_{9}\) alloys are compared to the Collver and Hammond data for Mo-Ru and Mo-Re amorphous alloys in Fig. 3. The magnitude of \(T_{c}\) variation with decreasing \(e/a\) is much less for the \(T_{5}T_{9}\) alloys and

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}  & & Heating rate & \(T_{x}\)b & Heating rate \\ Alloy & (K) & (K/min) & (K) & (K/min) \\ Nb55Rh45 & 951 ± 10 & 10 & 973 ± 10 & 8 \\ Ta55Rh45 & 1151 ± 10 & 10 & 1118 ± 10 & 3 \\ Nb55Ir45 & 1168 ± 10 & 10 & 1133 ± 10 & 3 \\ Ta55Ir45 & 1338 ± 10 & 10 & 1283 ± 10 the \(T_{e}\) values fall well below the curve for amorphous Mo-Ru and Mo-Re. Collver and Hammond [9] noted that vapor-deposited amorphous transition-metal alloys do not follow a "universal curve" for \(T_{e}\) vs \(e/a\) if the alloys are composed of transition-metal elements widely separated in the periodic table. It was suggested [9] that the lower \(T_{e}\)'s observed in amorphous alloys made from elements on opposite sides of the half filled \(d\) band were due to "charge transfer." It was proposed that this charge transfer may produce a local ordering which might reduce \(T_{e}\) by reducing the number of nearest neighbors. This suggestion is very speculative. The "rigid-band" model, which might be envoked to describe the "universal" \(T_{e}\) vs \(e/a\) curve for near neighbors in the periodic table, [8] apparently breaks down for alloys composed of constituents removed from one another in the periodic table. [9] Since the rigid-band concept is inapplicable, the specific normal-state electronic and lattice properties of a given alloy must be considered in order to explain \(T_{e}\).

The widths of the transition \(\Delta T_{e}\) from the normal to the superconducting state are noted (Fig. 3) to vary from \(<0.2\) to \(>1.0\) K. The largest \(\Delta T_{e}\)'s are observed near the boundary of the composition range where the amorphous phase is formed, i.e., in alloys with some fraction of crystalline material. The largest \(\Delta T_{e}\) values are seen for Nb\({}_{60}\)Rh\({}_{40}\) and Nb\({}_{50}\)Ir\({}_{50}\) alloys (Fig. 3). The crystalline phase existing close to Nb\({}_{60}\)Rh\({}_{40}\) in the equilibrium phase diagram is a \(\sigma\) phase with \(T_{e}\) = 4.04 K. [15] The \(\Delta T_{e}\) in the present study extends from 5.39 to 4.26 K. Thus, the completion of the transition is still above \(T_{e}\) for the equilibrium \(\sigma\) phase. However, a metastable crystal-line phase with \(T_{e}\) > 4.04 K or the influence of the amorphous matrix via the proximity effect might indicate a higher \(T_{e}\) for the minor crystalline phase. Conversely, the \(\Delta T_{e}\) might be unrelated to the small fraction of crystalline second phase but be due to composition gradients in, perhaps, interstitial impurities such as oxygen. It has been shown that interstitial content can have a marked effect on \(T_{e}\) in the crystalline phases in Nb-Ir alloys. [16] Similar speculation applies to the Nb\({}_{50}\)Ir\({}_{50}\) alloy where the equilibrium, \(\alpha_{1}\) (tetragonal), or metastable \(\alpha_{2}\) (orthorhombic), crystalline phases have \(T_{e}\) values \(\sim 4\) K. [17] Rapidly quenched Nb\({}_{48}\)Ir\({}_{52}\) alloys were found to have the \(\alpha_{2}\) orthorhombic crystal structure so that the traces of crystalline material in Nb\({}_{50}\)Ir\({}_{50}\) are most likely this phase. The equilibrium crystaline phases in the Ta-Rh system in the composition range of interest have \(T_{e}\) values of 2.0 to 2.35 K, [15, 18] while superconductivity has not been observed in the equilibrium phases of the Ta-Ir system at these compositions down to 1.2 K. [15, 18] Metastable crystalline phases have been obtained by rapid quenching for Nb\({}_{55}\)Ir\({}_{40}\)O\({}_{5}\), Ta\({}_{48}\)Rh\({}_{45}\)O\({}_{3}\), and Ta\({}_{58}\)Ir\({}_{42}\) with \(T_{e}\) values of 10.5, 10, and 6.6 K, respectively. [19] Thus, the amorphous \(T_{e}\)\(T_{e}\) alloys

Figure 4: Superconducting transition temperature \(T_{e}\) vs \(x\) in (Nb\({}_{1-x}\)Ta\({}_{x}\))\({}_{55}\)Ir\({}_{45}\).

  have \(T_{c}\) values comparable to (Nb-base alloys) or greater than (Ta-base alloys) those of the corresponding equilibrium crystalline phases. However, meta-stable crystalline phases stabilized by interstitial impurities can have much higher \(T_{c}\) values.

Boron was added to Nb-Ir alloys in a preliminary study of the influence of metalloid additions to this system. The following alloys were prepared: (Nb0.5IsIr0.45)8bB20, (Nb0.51Ir0.50)8aB20, and (Nb0.4Is7.52)8b20. The (Nb0.5IsIr0.45)8bB20 allow was found by x-ray diffraction to be mixed amorphous and crystalline while the other two alloys were completely amorphous. Therefore, B apparently shifts the glass-forming compositions to higher Ir content in the Nb-Ir system. The presence of B reduced the \(T_{c}\) of the amorphous phase to 2.89 K (with D_T__c_ extending to 2.32 K). The decrease of \(T_{c}\) with metalloid additions has also been observed in a systematic study of amorphous Mo0.6Ru0.4 alloys by Johnson and Williams.20

The \(T_{c}\) values resulting from substitution of Ta for Nb in (Nb1-xTa)75Si_Ta_45_ and (Nb1-xTa)75Si_Ta_45 are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. An almost linear decrease in \(T_{c}\) is observed as Ta replaces Nb in these alloys.

### Upper critical field _H__c_2

The upper critical field _H__c_2  _B__c_2 is plotted versus \(T_{c}\) in Fig. 6 for Ta55Rh45 and Nb55Ir45 as examples typical of all the data. An extended linear region of _B__c_2(_T_) is observed. Such linear _B__c_2(_T_) data are commonly observed in the amorphous superconductors studied to date3 and the magnitudes of \(\left. {d{B_{\epsilon 2}}(T)/{dT}} \right|_{T_{c}}\) are also comparable. These values are also similar to those observed for "dirty" (short mean free path) crystalline transition-metal alloys.21 The values for \(\left. {d{B_{\epsilon 2}}(T)/{dT}} \right|_{T_{c}}\) were similar for all the alloys measured at about 2.5 T/K.

### Electrical resistivity

The electrical resistivity measured at 10 K is plotted against composition \(x\) in Fig. 7 for the (Nb1-xTa)75Si_Ta_45 alloys. Substitution of Ta for Nb in these alloys increases the  resistivity and the Ir containing alloys have higher resistivities than the Rh alloys at a given value of \(x\). Resistivity increased slightly as the measuring temperature was lowered such that all alloys exhibited a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) of resistivity, \((1/\rho_{n})(d\rho_{n}/dT)\). The magnitude of the NTC increased with resistivity so that Nb3SRh45 had the smallest NTC and Ta55Ir45 the largest. The temperature coefficient of resistivity is plotted against composition in Fig. 8.

Explanations of resistivity in amorphous alloys have been based on the Ziman-Faber theory [22] for the resistivity of simple liquid metals and its extension to liquid transition metals. [23] The electrical resistivity of liquid or amorphous binary transition-metal alloys of components \(A\), \(B\) is given by [23]

\[\rho = C(K_{F})\int^{2K_{F}}|u(K)|^{2}K^{3}\,dK  Ginzburg-Landau-Abrikosov-Gor'kov (GLAG) theory [29] by the following expression:

\[\gamma = - \frac{\pi^{3}}{12}\frac{k_{B}}{e}\frac{1}{\rho_{\ast}}\frac{dB_{c2}}{ dT}\Big{|}_{T_{c}}\;\;,\]

where \(k_{B}\) is the Boltzmann constant and \(e\) is the electron charge. This expression should be applicable near \(T_{c}\) and in the dirty limit, i.e., where the electron mean free path is much less than the superconducting coherence length. This criterion is met by all the _T__5\(T\)9 alloys since the mean free path is 0.3-0.4 nm and the coherence length is 6.0-7.0 nm for \(T\) << \(T_{e}\). The general validity of this expression as applied to transition-metal alloys has been questioned.30 It was suggested that Eq. (3) is inapplicable in alloys with \(d\) and \(s\) electrons because the transport mean free path is determined mainly by \(s\) electrons while superconducting properties are controlled by the \(d\) electrons. This suggestion is questionable since, while clearly the \(s\) electrons carry the current, the dominant scattering is from the \(d\) electrons which determine the resistivity in transition metals. Furthermore, for elements to the left of Pd in the periodic table, such as the _T__5\(T\)9 alloys, there is sufficient hybridization of the \(s\) and \(d\) electrons [31] to make separate descriptions of \(s\) and \(d\) bands unlikely. The ultimate test of Eq. (3) is its agreement with experimental results. The literature was searched for alloys where the quantities in Eq. (3) had been measured and where measurements of \(g\) from low-temperature specific heat capacity are available. In Fig. 9, \(g\) calculated from the GLAG theory is plotted against experimentally determined \(g\) values for crystalline compounds, alloys, and amorphous alloys. Even though vapor-deposited V3Si and Nb3Sn do not meet the dirty-limit criterion,32 good agreement is observed. High-resistivity crystalline Ti-base alloys21 exhibit excellent agreement. Amorphous La-Ga alloys33 conform to the \(g\) calculated by the GLAG theory while La\({}_{76}\)-Au\({}_{24}\) does not show good agreement.34 However, if more recent35 (lower) resistivity data are used for La\({}_{76}\)Au\({}_{24}\), better agreement is observed. In general, the available data would seem to strongly support the validity of Eq. (3).

While direct measurements of \(g\) are not available, resistivity and superconducting property measurements on (M00,6Ru0,4)1-xSi\({}_{x}\) (Ref. 20) and (Mo1-xRu\({}_{x}\))80P\({}_{20}\) (Ref. 36) alloys do not appear to be consistent with Eq. (3). That is, \(g\) calculated from the GLAG theory was essentially constant with \(x\) in (Mo1-xRu\({}_{x}\))80P\({}_{20}\) even though \(T_{c}\) and \(N\) (\(E_{F}\)) (estimated from magnetic-susceptibility data) both decrease with \(x\). The \(g\) calculated for (Mo0,6Ru0,4)1-xSi\({}_{x}\) increased with \(x\) while \(T_{c}\) was decreasing. Thus, either the validity of Eq. (3) has been violated in these systems or \(T_{c}\) is controlled by some factor other than \(N\) (\(E_{F}\)). It may be significant that both these systems contain metalloid elements.

#### ii.2.2 Calculation of the electron-phonon coupling constant \(\lambda\)

One of the most important parameters in the theory of superconductivity is the electron-phonon coupling constant \(\lambda\). The \(\lambda\) can be calculated from the McMillan equation [37]

\[\lambda = \frac{1.04 + \mu^{\ast}\ln\left( \Theta_{D}/1.45T_{c} \right)}{\left( 1-0.62\mu^{\ast} \right)\ln\left( \Theta_{D}/1.45T_{c} \right)-1.04}\;\;,\]

where _m_* is the Coulomb pseudopotential and _th__D_ is the Debye temperature. The value for _m_* is not known but typically values of 0.1 to 0.2 are used. We used both _m_* = 0.1 and 0.15. The latter value is consistent with estimates38 for _m_* for the components of the _T__5\(T\)9 alloys. Values for _th__D_ were calculated from experimental measurements of Young's modulus \(Y\), and the following expression [39]:

\[\Theta_{D} = \frac{h}{k_{B}}\left( \frac{9N}{4\pi} \right)^{1/3}\frac{Y^{1/2}}{\overline{M}^{1/3}\overline{d}^{1/6}}f_{2}(\sigma)\;\;.\]

In Eq. (5) \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(N\) is Avogadro's number, \(\overline{M}\) is the mean atomic weight, \(d\) is the density, and \(f\)2(_s_) is a function of Poisson's ratio \(s\). If we assumed \(s\)  0.40, as commonly observed in amorphous alloys,40\(f_{2}(\sigma) = 0.46\). The calculated values of _th__D_ are listed in Table 3. They are approximately 25% lower than the weighted average of _th__D_ of the respective elements which make up the _T__5\(T\)9

Figure 9: _γ calculated from the GLAG theory vsγ measured in low-temperature specific-heat-capacity experiments. References given in text._

 alloys. Debye temperatures approximately 30% lower than the average of Th of the component elements have been directly measured by low-temperature specific heat (Cu5Zr43) or estimated from data (NbNi) for similar amorphous alloys.[41]

The l was calculated from Eq. (4) using the calculated Th values and 0.15. The results are listed in Table 3. It is apparent that the \(T\)5_7_9 amorphous alloys are "intermediate-coupled" superconductors. The l values for Nb58Rh45 and Nb53Ir45 are essentially identical as are those for Ta55Ir45 and Ta58Rh45. If 0.15 is assumed, l for the \(T\)5_7_9 alloys containing Ta is identical with l for pure Ta while the l's for the \(T\)5_7_9 alloys containing Nb are less than l for pure Nb (l = 0.92). Values for l calculated by taking the weighted average of the l's for the elements constituting the \(T\)5_7_9 alloys are also given in Table 3 and it is noted that they are comparable to the values determined from the _T_c and Th data.

#### iii.2.3 Calculation of the density of states N (_Ef_)

With values of \(g\) and l it is then possible to calculate \(N\) (_Ef_). The \(N\) (_Ef_) values are listed in Table 3 in the conventional units of states per eV atom. Density of states obtained this way, modified by the electron-phonon enhancement factor (1 + l), have been found to agree reasonably well with first principle band-structure calculations for transition-metal elements.[26, 37]

### Variation of \(T_{c}\) with \(g\), \(N\) (_Ef_), and l

Values of \(g\) were calculated from the GLAG expression [Eq. (3)] for the amorphous Ta-Rh alloys. Neither \(g\) nor \(T_{c}\) show appreciable variation with _e_/_a_. In Fig. 10 \(T_{c}\) is plotted against \(g\) for (Nb1=Ta)58Ir45 and (Nb1=Ta)58Rh45. A strong dependence of \(T_{c}\) on \(g\) is seen with separate curves for the alloys containing Ir and Rh. That is, even though the alloys with Rh have higher values of \(g\) than those containing Ir for a given Nb/Ta ratio, i.e., value of \(x\), the \(T_{c}\) values are similar for the two systems. Since l data are only available for the four \(T\)5_7\(9\) alloys (_x_ = 0 or 1), \(N\) (_Ef_) could only be calculated for these. \(T_{c}\) vs \(N\) (_Ef_) for the four alloys is illustrated in Fig. 11. Figure 11 resembles the \(T_{c}\) vs \(g\) plot of Fig. 10 since (1 + l) does not markedly change the values calculated for \(N\) (_Ef_) from \(g\). The dotted lines connecting the data for the Ir- and Rh-containing alloys indicate the expected behavior following the behavior of \(g\) in Fig. 10. Thus, the Nb/Ta ratio controls \(T_{c}\) even though Ir and Rh provide different density-of-states values.

Therefore, \(N\) (_Ef_) alone must not be controlling \(T_{c}\) in the amorphous _T__s_7_9 alloys. The l appears to reflect the \(T_{c}\) behavior more accurately than \(N\) (_Ef_). For example, in Ta53Ir45 and Ta58Rh45 where the \(T_{c}\) values are nearly identical, the l values only differ by approximately 1%, while the value for \(N\) (_Ef_) is about 15% greater for Ta58Rh45 than for Ta58Ir45.

The electron-phonon coupling parameter can be

  expressed as [37]

\[\lambda = \frac{N\left(E_{F} \right)\left\langle I^{2} \right\rangle}{M\left\langle \omega^{2} \right\rangle}\;\;,\]

where \(\left\langle I^{2} \right\rangle\) is the squared average electron-phonon matrix element, \(M\) is the atomic mass, and \(\left\langle\omega^{2} \right\rangle\) is the squared average phonon frequency which has often been estimated by \(\Theta\hat{\lambda}\). In certain classes of materials, including recent results on amorphous lanthanum-base alloys, [42] it has been found that \(\left\langle I^{2} \right\rangle/M\left\langle\omega^{2} \right\rangle\) is a constant and variations in \(\lambda\) are due to changes in \(N\left(E_{F} \right)\). This behavior is not observed in the \(T_{5}T_{9}\) alloys where \(\left\langle I^{2} \right\rangle/M\left\langle\omega^{2} \right\rangle\) increases by 50% from Nb58Rh45 to Ta55Ir45. The numerator \(N\left(E_{F} \right)\left\langle I^{2} \right\rangle\), which can be considered the "electron-ic" term, does not vary consistently with \(\lambda\) or \(T_{e}\), but does change by up to 27%, so it cannot be considered constant. The denominator, the "phonon term," also varies in the \(T_{5}T_{9}\) alloys, by as much as 38%. The \(\lambda\) for a given \(T_{5}T_{9}\) alloy is thus determined by both the electronic and phonon properties.

An additional possible influence on \(T_{e}\) in these \(T_{5}T_{9}\) alloys is the very short mean free path for electrons. Meisel and Cote [43] have recently suggested that the Pippard and Ziman [44] condition on electron-phonon interactions can depress \(T_{e}\). This condition states that phonons whose wavelengths exceed the electron mean free path are ineffective electron scatterers. The entire phonon spectrum contributes to \(T_{e}\). When the electron mean free path is short, the Pippard and Ziman condition introduces a residual-resistivity-dependent low-frequency cutoff on the phonon frequencies which contribute to \(T_{e}\). The \(T_{5}T_{9}\) amorphous alloys have high residual resistivities such that the Pippard and Ziman condition should apply. \(T_{e}\) is observed to decrease with increasing resistivity for these alloys but it is not clear how the mechanism suggested by Meisel and Cote can be separated from the other electronic and phonon contributions to \(\lambda\) and \(T_{e}\).

### \(N\left(E_{F} \right)\) and amorphous phase stability

The relative stability of amorphous phases has been discussed in terms of atomic size, [45] electronic structure, [46, 47] and structural complexity. [48] It would appear that a mixture of these effects controls stability in general, while certain alloy systems seem to be dominated by a given factor. As in crystalline materials, the stability problem is complex and as yet unresolved. Nagel and Tauc [47] have proposed a correlation of glass stability with \(e/a\) such that maximum stability occurs when \(N\left(E_{F} \right)\) is a minimum. Analogous to the Ziman-Faber theory for resistivity, this will occur when \(2K_{F}\), the "spanning vector" of the Fermi surface equals \(K_{p}\), the position of the first maximum in the structure factor \(S\left(k\right)\). Some experimental evidence as well as theoretical calculations [49, 50] support this model while other experimental results [51] do not. Since we have calculated \(N\left(E_{F} \right)\) for the \(T_{5}T_{9}\) alloys it is interesting to find a suitable parameter for relative stability for which a comparison can be made. One such possible parameter is the ratio of the crystallization temperature (at a constant heating rate) to the melting temperature of the alloy, \(T_{x}/T_{m}\). For the \(T_{5}T_{9}\) alloys \(T_{m}\) corresponds to the eutectic temperature. In Fig. 12, \(T_{x}/T_{m}\) is plotted against

Figure 11: Superconducting transition temperature, \(T_{e}\) vs \(N\left(E_{F} \right)\).

  \(N\left(E_{F}\right)\) with \(T_{x}\) determined at 10 degC/min and \(T_{m}\) obtained from the equilibrium phase diagrams.8 If \(T_{x}/T_{m}\) is a suitable parameter for measuring the amorphous phase stability, it is clear that the stability of the \(T_{x}T_{9}\) amorphous alloys increases with decreasing \(N\left(E_{F}\right)\). This is consistent with the Nagel and Tauc model and the resistivity results discussed in Sec. III.5.

A generally linear relationship has been found between \(T_{x}\) and NTC in \(\left({\text{Fe}}_{0.5}{\text{Ni}}_{0.5}\right)_{100-x}{\text{B}}_{\text{x}}\) alloys.52 It was suggested that these results provide strong evidence that an electronic contribution to the stability of metallic glasses exists. Similarly, in the present work an essentially linear relationship is found between \(T_{x}\) (or \(T_{x}/T_{m}\)) and NTC. This gives further support for the above suggestion.

## IV Summary and concluding remarks

The superconducting transition temperature has been measured in a number of \(T_{x}T_{9}\) amorphous alloys as a function of composition. Changing the composition within a given \(T_{x}T_{9}\) alloy had little effect on \(T_{c}\). Substituting Ta for Nb at a constant \(T_{9}\) composition decreased \(T_{e}\), with \(T_{e}\) dropping almost linearly with \(x\) in \(\left({\text{Nb}}_{1-x}{\text{Ta}}_{x}\right)_{55}{\text{Ir}}_{45}\) and \(\left({\text{Nb}}_{1-x}{\text{Ta}}_{x}\right)_{55}{\text{Rh}}_{45}\).

From the superconducting measurements, \(T_{c}\) and \(\left.dB_{e2}/dT\right|_{T_{c}}\), and the resistivity, a value for \(\gamma\) could be calculated using the GLAG theory. The \(\gamma\) values were used to estimate \(N\left(E_{F}\right)\) using l calculated from \(\Theta_{D}\), which was determined by elastic constant measurements. Comparing \(T_{e}\) with \(N\left(E_{F}\right)\) and l as a function of composition indicated that l reflects the \(T_{e}\) behavior more closely. That is, both \(T_{c}\) and l appear to be dominated by Nb and Ta while \(N\left(E_{F}\right)\) does depend on the \(T_{9}\) component. Examination of the quantities which determine l indicates that both the electronic and phonon terms must be considered. It would be useful to have more direct measurements of \(N\left(E_{F}\right)\) in these alloys, for example from low-temperature specific-heat capacity experiments. Then the calculated \(\gamma\) values could be confirmed, and more confidence could be placed on the above discussions.

The resistivity and negative coefficients of resistivity are consistent with the Ziman-Faber model. The increase in resistivity with Ta concentration may be rationalized by the stronger scattering of electrons from the Ta \(d\) bands.

If \(T_{x}/T_{m}\) is considered as a measure of glass stability, then to the extent that \(T_{x}/T_{m}\) decreases with \(N\left(E_{F}\right)\), the present data are consistent with the model of Nagel and Tauc.
