###### Abstract

We report the longitudinal resistivity and Hall effect measurements on the noncentrosymmetric superconducting Mg12-_d_Ir19B16 samples with different critical transition temperatures. A strong temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient R_{H} and nonlinear magnetic field dependence of the Hall resistivity p_{y}, in wide temperature region are observed, suggesting a strong multiband effect in this system. Moreover, a large magnetoresistance up to 20% is found at the field of 9 T. We also observe the violation of the Kohler's rule from our magnetoresistance data, further confirming the presence of multiband effect in our samples. A detailed analysis shows that the data cannot be simply described within the two-band scenario at low temperatures so we argue that there may be more than two bands contributing to the conduction of the samples.

The study on superconductors without inversion symmetry has attracted growing interest in the past years.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] The penetration depth and NMR measurements[10, 11] in two noncentrosymmetric superconductors, Li2Pt3B and Li2Pt3B, with similar structure have shown that the absence of inversion symmetry along with stronger spin-orbit coupling (SOC) may allow an admixture of spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairings. Mg10Ir19B16 (hereafter abbreviated as MIB) is another typical material without inversion symmetry.[12] A detailed study has shown that the MIB sample reveals a rather complex structure with a series of nested polyhedra.[13] The specific-heat and NMR measurements have shown that the Cooper pairs in MIB are predominantly in the spin-singlet state with an isotropic _s_-wave gap.[14, 15] Meanwhile, the unconventional pairing state is also suggested by the tunneling spectroscopy and penetration depth measurements in this system.[16, 17] The electronic structure of MIB has been calculated using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method, showing a rather complex band structure near the Fermi surface and finding that the strong hybridization of d states of Ir and p states of B and Mg due to the rather small interatomic distances may impose an important influence on the band structure in this system.[18] Therefore, one may expect a notable multiband effect in this system. However, no report about this issue can be seen from the experimental side. So an in-depth study using the Hall effect and magnetoresistance (MR) measurements is required.

We have known that, in conventional metals, the Hall coefficient R_{H} is almost independent of temperature in a rather wide temperature region. However, a clear temperature dependence of R_{H} has been found in the underdoped cuprate superconductors and multiband superconductor MgB2.[19, 20, 21, 22] The nonlinear magnetic field dependence of the Hall resistivity r_{y} and rather large MR are also observed in MgB2 thin films,[23, 24] which are attributed to the strong multiband effect. Recently, the multiband behaviors are also revealed in the recently discovered iron-based superconductors by the Hall effect measurements.[25, 26]

In this Brief Report, we report a detailed investigation on the transport properties on high-quality noncentrosymmetric MIB samples with different critical transition temperatures. We found a strong temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient R_{H} and nonlinear magnetic field dependence of the Hall resistivity r_{y} in wide temperature region, which were attributed to the multiband effect in the system. Moreover, a large magnetoresistance (D_r_/_r_0) and the violation of the Kohler's rule were observed in all the samples, further confirming the argument about multiband effect.

The MIB polycrystalline samples used in this study were prepared using a standard method of solid-state reaction. The synthesizing process is the same as our previous work[14] except that a relatively long time up to 10 h was used in the second sintering process. The samples were cut into a bar shape with typical dimensions of 3.2\times 1.8\times 0.3 mm^{3}. A six-probe technique was employed to carry out the measurements, which ensures us to measure the longitudinal and Hall resistivity simultaneously at each temperature. The magnetic field up to 9 T was applied perpendicular to the sample surface.

The x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of our samples were carried out by a _Mac-Science_ MXP18A-HF diffractometer with the Cu K_{a} radiation. The ac susceptibility was measured based on an Oxford cryogenic system (Maglab-Exa-12). The longitudinal resistivity (r_{y}) and the Hall resistivity (r_{y}) were measured on the Quantum Design instrument physical property measurement system with temperature down to 1.8 K. We used a dc technique for electrical resistivity measurements and the current was reversed to correct any thermopower resulting from the electrical contact. The temperature stabilization was better than 0.1% and the resolution of the voltmeter was better than 10 nV.

Temperature dependence of the ac susceptibility of three samples with different T_{c} are shown in Fig. 1(a). The onset points of the superconducting transitions in the susceptibility curves are 2.5 K, 4.7 K, and 5.7 K, respectively, for the three samples. The differences in T_{c} have been reported to originate from the small variety of the amounts of Mg, Ir, and B in the formula, and in general, samples with lower T_{c} have more Ir vacancies.[15, 27] These Ir vacancies are believed to induce additional inversion-symmetry breaking and enhance  the SOC in the system.[15] Hereafter we denote the three samples as MIB2.5K, MIB4.7K, and MIB5.7K, respectively. In Fig. 1(b), we show the temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistivity \rho_{xx} near the superconducting transition under zero field. One can see that the transition width determined from resistive measurements (1-99% \rho_{x}) is only about 0.2 K, which is consistent with the rather sharp magnetic transition as revealed by the ac susceptibility data. The residual resistivity of about 100 \mu\Omega cm here is much smaller than the value reported in the previous work,[12, 14, 16] which suggests that the samples used in this study is much cleaner with fewer scattering centers. The resistivity data for two samples MIB2.5K and MIB5.7K are shown in the inset in a rather wide temperature range.

The XRD patterns for two samples MIB2.5K and MIB5.7K are shown in Fig. 2. It is clear that all the main peaks can be indexed to the bcc crystal structure. Only tiny peaks from impurities were found, as represented by the blue asterisks.

The inset of Fig. 3 shows the field dependence of the Hall resistivity \rho_{xy} at different temperatures for the sample MIB2.5K. In the experiment, \rho_{xy} was taken as \rho_{xy}=[\rho(+H)-\rho(-H)]/2 at each point to eliminate the effect of the misaligned Hall electrodes. Clear nonlinear field dependence of \rho_{xy} can be seen in the low-temperature region, which is actually consistent with the multiband scenario as revealed in MgB_{2} and iron-based superconductors.[23, 25] As the temperature increases, the behavior of the curves evolves into linearity gradually, indicating the weakening of the multiband effect at high temperatures. Temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient (R_{H}=\rho_{xy}/H) for three samples is shown in the main frame of Fig. 3. One can see rather strong temperature dependence of R_{H} in low-temperature region. This behavior gives another evidence of the presence of multiband effect in our samples. Here we employ a simple two-band model to interpret our data qualitatively. We have known that for a two-band system in the low-field limit, the Hall coefficient R_{H} can be written as

\[R_{H}=\frac{\sigma_{i}^{2}R_{1}+\sigma_{z}^{2}R_{2}}{(\sigma_{1}+\sigma_{2})^{ 2}},\] (1)

where \sigma_{i}(i = 1, 2) is the conductance of the charge carriers in different bands and R_{i}=-1/n_{i}e represents the Hall coefficient

Inset: magnetic field dependence of the Hall resistivity \rho_{xy} at different temperatures for sample MIB2.5K.

  for the carriers in each band separately with n_{i} the concentration of the charge carriers in the different bands. From Eq. (1), we know that the contributions of R_{H} from different bands are mainly determined by \sigma_{i}, which can be influenced by the scattering relaxation time \tau. The charge carriers in different bands may have different \tau, which varies differently with temperature. In this case, each band can produce complex contributions to the total R_{H}. We note that this effect is more remarkable in the samples with lower T_{c} and the sign-reversing effect of R_{H} can be even seen in the samples MIB2.5K and MIB4.7K. Considering the fact that more defects (Ir vacancies) consist in the samples with lower T_{c}, this behavior can be interpreted by the enhancement of SOC induced by defects, which can lift the twofold spin degeneracy of the electron bands and reinforce the multiband effect, being consistent with the arguments stated by the NMR and \muSR (muon spin rotation/relaxation) measurements.[15, 28] The sign-reversing behavior actually indicates the presence of different types of charge carriers (electron and hole type) in the present system. The temperature dependence of R_{H} becomes weak at high temperatures, being consistent with the linear behavior in the \rho_{yx}-H curves at high temperatures as shown in the inset of Fig. 3. We argue that the multiband nature in this system is the basis of the possible two-gap behavior as revealed by the penetration depth study,[17] in a way.

To further confirm our conclusions, we study the magnetoresistance in the same system. Here we present the results of two samples MIB2.5K and MIB5.7K. In the main frame of Fig. 4 we show the temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistivity \rho_{xx} under different fields for MIB2.5K. Clear MR effect can be observed even in this raw data. Here MR is defined as \Delta\rho/\rho_{0}=\left[\rho_{xx}(H)-\rho_{0}\right]/\rho_{0}, where \rho_{xx}(H) and \rho_{0} represent the longitudinal resistivity at a magnetic field H and that at zero field, respectively. Temperature dependence of \Delta\rho/\rho_{0} for two samples MIB2.5K and MIB5.7K obtained under 9 T is shown in the inset of Fig. 4. The value of MR for these two samples are determined to be 25% and 20%, respectively, at about 6 K. It has been pointed out that in a single-band system, the Lorentz force is balanced by the Hall field. As a result, the charge carriers can move as if in zero field and they will never be deflected. In that case, there will be no obvious magnetoresistance observed. So the large value of MR observed here is quite consistent with the multiband scenario stated above. In addition, we notice that the value of MR is lager for sample MIB2.5K than that of MIB5.7K at the same temperature and field, which give another evidence that the added defects strengthen the multiband effect in sample MIB2.5K.

Another evidence of the multiband effect is the violation of the Kohler's rule. The semiclassical transport theory has predicted that the Kohler's rule will hold if only one isotropic relaxation time is present in a single-band system.[29] The Kohler's rule can be written as

\[\frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho_{0}}=f\left(\frac{\mu_{0}H}{\rho_{0}}\right),\] (2)

where f(x) is an implicit function which is independent of temperature. Equation (2) means that the \Delta\rho/\rho_{0} vs \mu_{0}H/\rho_{0} curves (the so-called Kohler plot) for different temperatures should be scaled to a universal curve if the Kohler's rule is obeyed. Figure 5(a) shows the Kohler plot from the MR data for the sample MIB2.5K. An obvious violation of the Kohler's rule can be seen from this plot. We attribute this behavior to the multiband effect in this system, just as the case in MgB_{2}, where the different temperature dependence of the relaxation times in different bands was considered to be the main reason of the violation of the Kohler's rule.[24]

Figure 4: (Color online) Main frame: temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistivity \rho_{xx} for the sample MIB2.5K under different magnetic fields. Inset: temperature dependence of the magnetoresistance \Delta\rho/\rho_{0} obtained under 9 T for two samples MIB2.5K and MIB5.7K.

  To get a comprehensive understanding, we have attempted to fit the field dependent MR data using a simple two-band model,

\[\frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho_{0}}=\frac{(\mu_{0}H)^{2}}{\alpha+\beta\times(\mu_{0}H)^{2}}\] (3)

with \alpha and \beta the fitting parameters which were related to the conductances and mobilities for the charge carriers in two bands. Shown in Fig. 5(b) is the magnetic field dependence of \Delta\rho/\rho_{0} at several selected temperatures for the sample MIB2.5K. One can see the nonlinear behavior in each curve. The fitting results using Eq. (3) are represented by the solid lines. Clear departure from the experimental data can be observed in the low-temperature region. When the temperature is higher than 60 K, the theoretical curves based on the two-band model can roughly describe the data. Therefore, we can conclude that, at least in low temperatures, there may be more than two bands contributing to the conduction of our samples. In other words, the conduction of our samples is dominated by more than two bands at low temperatures, then it behaves like the two-band scenario in the intermediate temperature region, and finally it evolves to the single-band behavior at temperatures above 160 K when the interband scattering becomes very strong.

In summary, Hall effect and magnetoresistance were measured on the noncentrosymmetric superconductors Mg_{12-}\mu_{19}B_{16} with different T_{c}. We found a strong temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient R_{H} and nonlinear field dependence of the Hall resistivity \rho_{xy} in wide temperature region in all the samples investigated here. Moreover, a rather large magnetoresistance up to 20% under 9 T and the violation of the Kohler's rule were observed in our samples. These experimental features are all consistent with the conclusion that the samples we studied belong to the multiband system. A more detailed analysis shows that there may be more than two bands contributing to the conduction of the samples in the low-temperature region. We also find that the added defects in the samples with lower T_{c} can strengthen the multiband effect.

The temperature dependence of R_{H} becomes weak at high temperatures, being consistent with the linear behavior in the \rho_{yx}-H curves at high temperatures as shown in the inset of Fig. 3. We argue that the multiband nature in this system is the basis of the possible two-gap behavior as revealed by the penetration depth study,[17] in a way.

To further confirm our conclusions, we study the magnetoresistance in the same system. Here we present the results of two samples MIB2.5K and MIB5.7K. In the main frame of Fig. 4 we show the temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistivity \rho_{xx} under different fields for MIB2.5K. Clear MR effect can be observed even in this raw data. Here MR is defined as \Delta\rho/\rho_{0}=\left[\rho_{xx}(H)-\rho_{0}\right]/\rho_{0}, where \rho_{xx}(H) and \rho_{0} represent the longitudinal resistivity at a magnetic field H and that at zero field, respectively. Temperature dependence of \Delta\rho/\rho_{0} for two samples MIB2.5K and MIB5.7K obtained under 9 T is shown in the inset of Fig. 4. The value of MR for these two samples are determined to be 25% and 20%, respectively, at about 6 K. It has been pointed out that in a single-band system, the Lorentz force is balanced by the Hall field. As a result, the charge carriers can move as if in zero field and they will never be deflected. In that case, there will be no obvious magnetoresistance observed. So the large value of MR observed here is quite consistent with the multiband scenario stated above. In addition, we notice that the value of MR is lager for sample MIB2.5K than that of MIB5.7K at the same temperature and field, which give another evidence that the added defects strengthen the multiband effect in sample MIB2.5K.

Another evidence of the multiband effect is the violation of the Kohler's rule. The semiclassical transport theory has predicted that the Kohler's rule will hold if only one isotropic relaxation time is present in a single-band system.[29] The Kohler's rule can be written as

\[\frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho_{0}}=f\left(\frac{\mu_{0}H}{\rho_{0}}\right),\] (2)

where f(x) is an implicit function which is independent of temperature. Equation (2) means that the \Delta\rho/\rho_{0} vs \mu_{0}H/\rho_{0} curves (the so-called Kohler plot) for different temperatures should be scaled to a universal curve if the Kohler's rule is obeyed. Figure 5(a) shows the Kohler plot from the MR data for the sample MIB2.5K. An obvious violation of the Kohler's rule can be seen from this plot. We attribute this behavior to the multiband effect in this system, just as the case in MgB_{2}, where the different temperature dependence of the relaxation times in different bands was considered to be the main reason of the violation of the Kohler's rule.[24]

  To get a comprehensive understanding, we have attempted to fit the field dependent MR data using a simple two-band model,

\[\frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho_{0}}=\frac{(\mu_{0}H)^{2}}{\alpha+\beta\times(\mu_{0}H)^{2}}\] (3)

with \alpha and \beta the fitting parameters which were related to the conductances and mobilities for the charge carriers in two bands. Shown in Fig. 5(b) is the magnetic field dependence of \Delta\rho/\rho_{0} at several selected temperatures for the sample MIB2.5K. One can see the nonlinear behavior in each curve. The fitting results using Eq. (3) are represented by the solid lines. Clear departure from the experimental data can be observed in the low-temperature region. When the temperature is higher than 60 K, the theoretical curves based on the two-band model can roughly describe the data. Therefore, we can conclude that, at least in low temperatures, there may be more than two bands contributing to the conduction of our samples. In other words, the conduction of our samples is dominated by more than two bands at low temperatures, then it behaves like the two-band scenario in the intermediate temperature region, and finally it evolves to the single-band behavior at temperatures above 160 K when the interband scattering becomes very strong.

In summary, Hall effect and magnetoresistance were measured on the noncentrosymmetric superconductors Mg_{12-}\mu_{19}B_{16} with different T_{c}. We found a strong temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient R_{H} and nonlinear field dependence of the Hall resistivity \rho_{xy} in wide temperature region in all the samples investigated here. Moreover, a rather large magnetoresistance up to 20% under 9 T and the violation of the Kohler's rule were observed in our samples. These experimental features are all consistent with the conclusion that the samples we studied belong to the multiband system. A more detailed analysis shows that there may be more than two bands contributing to the conduction of the samples in the low-temperature region. We also find that the added defects in the samples with lower T_{c} can strengthen the multiband effect.
