###### Abstract

The superconducting and normal state characteristics of yttrium
hexaboride (YB6) have been investigated for the single crystals with a
transition temperatures T_(c) ranging between 4.2 K and 7.6 K. The
extracted set of microscopic parameters [the coherence length
ξ(0) ∼ 320-340 A, the penetration depth λ(0) ∼ 1100-3250 A and the mean
free path of charge carriers l = 11-58 A, the Ginzburg-Landau-Maki
parameters κ_(1, 2)(0) ∼ 3.3-9.5, and the superconducting gap
Δ(0) ∼ 6.2-14.8 K] confirms the type II superconductivity in "dirty
limit" (ξ ≫ l) with a medium to strong electron-phonon interaction (the
electron-phonon interaction constant $\lambda_{c,\rm{ph}}=0.32$-0.96)
and s-type pairing of charge carriers in this compound
[2Δ(0)/k_(B)T_(c) ≈ 3-4]. The comparative analysis of charge transport
(resistivity, Hall and Seebeck coefficients) and thermodynamic (heat
capacity, magnetization) properties in the normal state in YB6 allowed
to assume a transition into the cage-glass state at T^(*) ∼ 50 K with a
static disorder in the arrangement of the Y³⁺ ions. We argue that the
significant T_(c) variations in YB6 single crystals are determined by
two main factors: (i) the superconductivity enhancement is related with
the increase of the number of vacancies, both at yttrium and boron
sites, leading to nonstoichiometric composition, which is accompanied by
the enhancement of electron-phonon interaction in the hexaboride
lattice; (ii) stronger T_(c) depression is observed in near
stoichiometric and more dense crystals and it is induced by the
development of _bcc_ lattice instability producing strong distortion,
disordering, and formation of defect complexes in the matrix of YB6.

## I Introduction

The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in magnesium
diboride (MgB2) with T_(c) ∼ 39 K [1] stimulated an interest in the
study of microscopic mechanisms, which are responsible for
superconductivity in higher borides RB₆ and RB₁₂ with a rigid covalent
framework composed of boron clusters. The maximum transition temperature
in these model superconductors-cage glasses [2] was observed in yttrium
hexaboride YB6 (T_(c) ∼ 8 K [3]) in which the pairing is mainly
influenced by low-energy (∼8 meV) Einstein-like quasilocal vibrations of
yttrium ions bound loosely in the B₂₄ cuboctahedra of the boron
sublattice.

The strong T_(c) dispersion (1.5-8.4 K) reported for YB6 samples by
different authors [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] has no satisfactory explanation up
to now. For example, the YB6 single crystals grown by a modified Al-Ga
flux growth method in Al2O3 crucible under Ar pressure show
T_(c) = 5.8 ± 0.1 K regardless on the initial composition. The T_(c)
values for samples grown by argon arc melting are 6.8-7.0 K. For YB6
with nominal compositions obtained by ultrafast quenching from melt the
starting point of the resistive transition to superconducting state was
observed at T_(c) ∼ 8.4 K [4]. Superconducting transition temperatures
of YB6 single crystals grown by induction zone melting also reach high
values T_(c) = 7.2 K [3], 7.5 K [5, 6], and 7.7 K [7]. The lowest values
of T_(c) = 1.5-6.3 K were reported for powder samples prepared by the
borothermal reduction [8]. To explain such a significant T_(c) variation
it was suggested in Ref. [3] that the transition temperature is
controlled by the B/Y ratio (the highest T_(c) was obtained for a B/Y <
6). Thus, both a growth of a number of boron vacancies, which is
associated with the deviation from the stoichiometric composition of the
boron sublattice, and a decrease of yttrium vacancies in contrast, which
requires a stoichiometric metal sublattice composition, result according
to Ref. [3] in a _T_c enhancement in this compound. However, this
conclusion contradicts clearly observations made in Ref. [6] where the
highest _T_c was observed on the sample with the lowest residual
resistivity. Moreover, whereas the microanalysis results [3] indicate a
significant concentration of boron vacancies (for YB5.7-5.8
composition), the most of the YB6 single crystals grown by zone melting
[9] correspond approximately to a composition YB6.1, which points to the
presence of yttrium vacancies in the hexaboride matrix. It should be
emphasized that some of the mentioned methods of YB6 synthesis
correspond to nonequilibrium crystallization conditions. This fact
allows us to assume that the superconducting transition temperature can
be significantly modified in the nonequilibrium, metastable state of
yttrium hexaboride. A fairly large residual resistivity ρ₀∼ 8-25 _m_d cm
and a rather small residual resistivity ratio ρ(300 K)/ρ₀ = 2-4.5
observed for all the YB6 single crystals studied up to now also indicate
strong low temperature scattering of charge carriers on crystal
structure defects and inhomogeneities, which can be associated also with
a nonequilibrium state of yttrium hexaboride.

According to the conclusion of Ref. [10] YB6 is located on the border of
stability of the _R_B6 structure corresponding to the smallest size of
metallic (Y3+) ion in the hexaboride family and, hence, being unstable
with respect to decomposition into neighboring binary phases. Similarly
to other higher borides, the YB6 crystal lattice is stabilized in the
homogeneity range by introducing structural defects, predominantly
vacancies in the metal and boron sublattices [11,12]. As a result, YB6
strongly differs, for example, from LaB6. Actually, the electrical
resistivity of YB6 is five-eight times larger than that of LaB6 at room
temperature (see Fig. 2 below), the mass MR ratio of yttrium and
lanthanum ions is 0.64, and the ratio of phonon frequencies ω_(R) of
these two ions is about 0.62. This points to a large amplitude of Y
vibrations given by (ℏ/2M_(R)ω_(R))^(1/2) and thus to a strong
electron-phonon coupling, which is, roughly speaking, proportional to
the amplitude of the _R_–ion’s quasilocal vibrations. The strong phonon
softening in YB6 (8 meV) in comparison with LaB6 (13 meV) may therefore
be attributed to the decreasing potential of yttrium quasistable sites
[13].

Superconducting _T_c enhancement in the vicinity of lattice
instabilities in the nonequilibrium state is a well-known effect which
is up to now not well understood in detail. For example, the amorphous
beryllium films deposited by evaporation on low temperature substrates
show _T_c of about 10 K enhanced if compared with _T_c = 0.026 K for the
_hcp_ phase of Be [14,15]. The value of _T_c in Ga thin films prepared
by condensation at low temperatures increases up to 8.4 K from that of
1.1 K for bulk gallium [16]. Nonequilibrium Al1-xSi_(x) solid solutions
demonstrate a _T_c variation between 1.18 K (_x_ = 0) and 11 K (_x_  
0.2), their superconductivity enhancement being attributed to a lattice
instability developed in these _fcc_ Al-based crystals [17-19].
Therefore, it is interesting to consider YB6 crystals with different
_T_c values from the point of view of nonequilibrium superconductivity
investigating correlation between _bcc_ lattice instability and _T_c
changes.

In this context the presented results of detailed studies of specific
heat, magnetization, resistivity, Hall and Seebeck coefficients, and
hydrostatic density in YB6 single crystals with different values of _T_c
in the range between 4.2 K and 7.6 K allowed us to elucidate the
mechanism, which is responsible for the enhancement/suppression of
superconductivity. We argue that development of lattice instability
occurs in the stoichiometric YB6 located on the border of stability of
_R_B6 row. The instability overcomes in the presence of isolated
vacancies on boron and yttrium sites of the boride matrix, and it is the
main factor which controls the observed _T_c changes.

The paper is organized as follows: Experimental details and results are
shown in Secs. II and III, respectively. In the discussion part IV A the
data analysis of the superconducting state is presented and we argue in
favor of type II superconductivity in the "dirty limit" with a medium to
strong electron-phonon interaction and _s_-type pairing of charge
carriers in YB6. In part IV B a detailed analysis of the normal state
parameters is undertaken which allowed us to assume that below _T_*   50
K a cage-glass state forms in YB6. Final conclusions are formulated in
Sec. V.

## II Experimental details

Measurements were performed on four single crystals of yttrium
hexaboride with _T_c = 4.2 K (No. 4), 6.2 K (No. 3), 7.3 K (No. 2), and
7.4 K (No. 1) (according to results of zero-field heat capacity
measurements). It is argued below (see Sec. IV B and Fig. 14) that the
main difference between YB6 single crystals No. 1-No. 4 is caused by the
number of vacancies producing mass density changes in the samples. Thus,
the higher _T_c crystals No. 1 and No. 2 are characterized by the
nonstoichiometric composition with a high number of Y and B vacancies in
the hexaboride matrix. On the contrary, the dense and near
stoichiometric YB6 samples No. 3 and No. 4 are nonequilibrium, distorted
crystals with lower _T_c values. The studied single crystals were grown
by induction zone melting in IPM NASU, Kiev, using rods sintered from
powder obtained by hydrothermal reduction of yttrium oxide (Y2O3) with a
purity of 99.999

## III Results and discussion

### Resistivity

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependences of resistivity ρ(T) of all
four studied YB6 crystals. The ρ(T) curve of the LaB6 crystal is also
shown for comparison. The ρ(T) curves exhibit a typical metallic
behavior with a rather small residual resistivity ratio ρ(300
K)/ρ₀ = 2.2-4.5 for YB6. The residual resistivity ρ₀ ≈ 8 μΩ cm of sample
No. 1 with the highest T_(c) = 7.55 K is the smallest among YB6
crystals, but it is about 470 times higher than that of LaB6. The
increase of ρ₀ is accompanied by a decrease of T_(c) [Fig. 2] which is
in accordance with results of Refs. [3] and [6]. Inset in Fig. 2 shows
the ρ(T) dependence in the vicinity of the superconducting transition.
For all YB6 single crystals studied we observed a wide enough
resistivity transition with a width of ΔT_(c)^((ρ)) ∼ 0.12-0.45 K [Table
1] as well as nonmonotonous ρ(T) behavior near T_(c), which is a
particularly discerned for sample No. 1 with maximal T_(c). The
T_(c)^((ρ)) values found as midpoints ρ(T_(c)) = 1/2ρ₀ of resistivity
transitions are shown in Table 1.

$n_{\rm Y}$ is the concentration of Y ions) which is slightly below one
conduction electron per yttrium ion. Only moderate changes of R_(H)(T)
are observed with the temperature lowering being in the limit of 2.2

The temperature dependences of the Seebeck coefficient (Fig. 11)
demonstrate a typical metallic behavior–the magnitude of S(T) changes
from negative values ∼1-4.5 μV/K at intermediate temperatures 80-300 K
to small alternating ones −0.5-0.5 μV/K in the low temperature range. As
a result, two main features of thermopower can be detected for samples
No. 2 and No. 3: (i) a peak near T_(c) and (ii) a S(T) maximum in the
vicinity of T^(*) ∼ 50 K (see Fig. 11) which corresponds to previously
discussed anomaly of the Hall coefficient (Fig. 10).

In the range between these two features a minimum on S(T) curves is
observed. Instead of a peak on S(T) dependence a shoulder can be
identified at T^(*) for sample No. 4 in combination with a steplike
anomaly in the range T < 150 K. Then, in the superconducting state, the
thermopower decreases sharply to close to zero values (see also inset in
Fig. 11) which are typical for superconductors [29].

### Characteristics of the superconducting state of YB₆

#### iv.1.1 Analysis of specific heat

The specific heat results in the normal and superconducting states
[Figs. 3 and 4] were used to determine the

of S(T) data for sample No. 4 by the phonon-drag thermopower with a

details). The inset shows an enlarged area near the superconducting
transition temperature T_(c). The arrows indicate T_(c) and the

phase transition to the cage-glass state. The insets show the
temperature dependence of the Hall mobility μ_(H)(T) = R_(H)(T)/ρ(T).
The solid lines in the insets demonstrate the approximation of the Hall

where F and U denote the free and internal energies, S–the entropy,
V–the molar volume, and the indices n and s correspond to
characteristics of the normal and superconducting phases of YB6. The
integration was carried out in the temperature range from T to T_(c).
Before the integration the specific heat data in the normal and
superconducting states were approximated by polynomials of the fourth
order. Figures 12(a) and 12(b) show the dependences of the thermodynamic
$H_{\rm cm}(T)$ and upper critical fields H_(c2)(T), respectively,
resulting from the heat capacity analysis of studied crystals. Table 1
presents the $H_{\rm cm}(0)$ values obtained by extrapolation of
$H_{\rm cm}(T)$ curves in the framework of the standard
Bardeen-Cooper-Schriffer (BCS) relation

$$H_{\rm cm}(T)/H_{\rm cm}(0) = 1.7367(1-T/T_{c})[1-0.327(1-T/T_{c})$$

In addition, Table 1 presents also the derivatives dH_(c2)/dT at
T = T_(c) obtained from experimental data and the upper critical field
H_(c2)(0) defined within the framework of formula used in Ref. [30]

$$H_{c2}(0)=-0.69T_{c}\left(\frac{dH_{c2}}{dT}\right)_{T=T_{c}}.$$

Using the value of the electronic specific heat coefficient γ ≈ 3.8-3.85
mJ/(mol K²) received for crystals No. 1 and No. 2 [see Fig. 5(a)], the
density of electronic states at the Fermi level N_(b)(E_(F)) = 0.119 (eV
atom)⁻¹ known from band structure calculations [31,32] and the relation
$\gamma=1/3\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}N_{b}(E_{F})(1+\lambda_{\rm e-ph})$
(k_(B)–Boltzmann constant), we estimate the electron-phonon interaction
constant $\lambda_{\rm e-ph}=0.93$-0.96 in good agreement with results
of [3]. On the contrary, a strongly reduced value of
$\lambda_{\rm e-ph}~{}\approx$ 0.32 can be deduced from γ ≈ 2.59 mJ/(mol
K²) observed for crystal No. 4 [see Fig. 5(b)].

Then, from BCS relations

$$\Delta(0)=\frac{H_{\rm cm}(0)}{\sqrt{2\pi\,N(E_{F})}}$$
(6)

$$\xi(0)=\sqrt{\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\,H_{c2}}}$$

$$\kappa_{1}(T)=\frac{H_{c2}(T)}{\sqrt{2\,H_{\rm cm}(T)}},$$
(8)

where Φ₀ denotes the flux quantum, the Ginzburg-Landau-Maki parameter
κ₁(T)[33] (Fig. 13), the superconducting gap Δ(0), the coherence length
ξ(0), and the penetration depth λ(0) = κ₁(0) ⋅ ξ(0) [Table 1] could be
calculated. For sample No. 3, due to the presence of a magnetic
contribution to heat capacity (see Fig. 5) and the associated problem
with the determination of the Sommerfeld coefficient, the estimation of
γ was obtained from the relation
$\gamma\,T_{c}^{2}/H_{\rm cm}^{2}(0)=const$[3]. Thus, for sample No. 3
we obtained γ ≈ 2.94 mJ/(mol K²) and $\lambda_{\rm e-ph}=0.5$ detecting
a strong reduction of the electron-phonon interaction in this YB₆
crystal. The ratio of 2.Δ/k_(B)T_(c) ≈ 3.9-4 found in this study for No.
1-No. 3 YB₆ samples coincides with results obtained both in Ref. [3],
from the heat capacity analysis and from the point-contact and tunnel
spectra of Refs. [34,35], and it significantly exceeds the value of 3.52
of the BCS model. On the contrary, a small enough value of
2.Δ/k_(B)T_(c) ∼ 3 was detected for sample No. 4. It is also worth
noting that the smaller values of 2.Δ/k_(B)T_(c) ≈ 3.8 found in Ref.
[36] and 3.6 in Ref. [37] from ultrahigh resolution photoemission
spectra at 5 K and tunneling spectra at 4.3 K, respectively, obviously
may be attributed to gap Δ(T) lowering at about 5 K (close to T_(c) ≈ 7
K) in comparison with Δ(0).

### Analysis of magnetization

The analysis of magnetization was carried out based on formulas which
are well known from the Abrikosov theory of type-II superconductivity
[38]

−4π M = (H_(c2) − H)/[(2κ₂² − 1)β_(Δ)]
(9)

H_(c1)(T) = H_(c2)/2κ₂²(ln κ₂ + a),
(10)

where κ₂ is the Ginzburg-Landau-Maki parameter [33, 39], β_(Δ) = 1.16
the coefficient corresponding to a triangular lattice of Abrikosov
vortices, and a the constant depending on impurity concentration.
Presented in Fig. 8 are the linear dependences of magnetization M(H) in
the superconducting phase near H_(c2) which allow us to derive the κ₂(T)
behavior within the framework of Eq. (9) [see Fig. 13]. Then, the
extrapolation to zero temperature provides the values of κ₂(0) and a
parameters. In addition, the use of relation (7) allows us to estimate
the coherence length ξ(0) and the penetration depth λ(0) = κ₂(0) ⋅ ξ(0)
(see Table 2).

The comparison of Ginzburg-Landau-Maki parameters κ₁(T) and κ₂(T)[33,
38, 39] for crystals No. 1-No. 3 obtained from the analysis of heat
capacity [Eq. (8)] and magnetization [Eq. (9)], respectively, shows that
κ₁ and κ₂ differ mainly near T_(c), but their characteristics are
practically identical at temperatures below T_(c)/2 (Fig. 13) resulting
in the relation κ₁ ≥ κ₂ for temperatures below T_(c). However, according
to Refs. [39, 40] in case of a superconductor in the "dirty limit" an
opposite inequality κ₁ ≤ κ₂ is expected for any relation between the
mean free path l of charge carriers and the coherence length ξ. Our
estimates of l from residual resistivity ρ₀, from the Hall coefficient
R_(H), and from parameters ξ(0) and Δ(0) lead within the framework of
standard relations

l = R_(H)m^(*)v_(F)/(eρ₀)
(11)

ξ(0) = ℏv_(F)/[π Δ(0)]
(12)

(where v_(F) is the average Fermi velocity and m^(*) the effective mass,
m^(*) = 1.03m₀[41]) to values of l = 11-58 A for the studied crystals
(see Table 3). This results also in inequality l ≪ ξ that validates the
"dirty limit" for superconductivity in YB₆. Note that both the Fermi
velocity v_(F) ≈ 0.9-2.1 × 10⁷ cm/s and the relaxation time of charge
carriers τ_(e) ≈ 1.3-2.8 × 10⁻¹⁴ s derived here (Table 3) are in good
agreement with the estimates obtained for YB₆ in μSR [42] (v_(F)∼ 10⁷
cm/s) and in optical conductivity [43] (τ_(e) ≈ 2.1 × 10⁻¹⁴ s at T = 9
K) studies. It is also worth noting that for type-II superconductors in
the dirty limit ξ ≫ l the relation

κ_(d) = κ_(p) + 7.53 × 10³ρ₀γ^(1/2)
(13)

(see, e.g., [40]) may be applied for κ_(d) ≫ κ_(p) (κ_(d) and κ_(p) are
Ginzburg-Landau-Maki parameters in the dirty and pure limits,
correspondingly) to carry out the "upper limit" estimation of γ.

Knowing the residual resistivity ρ₀ and κ₂ for sample No. 3 (see Tables
2 and 3) we obtain γ ≈ 3.02 mJ/(mol K²), which is in good agreement with
our previous result γ ≈ 2.94 mJ/(mol K²). Figure 14 shows ξ, λ, and l as
a dependence of the electron-phonon interaction constant
$\lambda_{\rm e-ph}$ in studied YB₆ crystals. In Fig. 14 we summarize
also information about the transition temperature
$T_{c}(\lambda_{\rm e-ph})$, the superconducting gap
$\Delta(\lambda_{\rm e-ph})$, the jump $\Delta(\lambda_{\rm e-ph})$ of
heat capacity at T_(c), and about the mass densities g^(m),
$g_{\rm m}^{S}(\lambda_{\rm e-ph})$ of samples No. 1-No. 4. It can be
seen that all these characteristics except ξ change monotonously with
$\lambda_{\rm e-ph}$ and their variation becomes faster when the
electron-phonon interaction decreases below 0.5. The reasons for this
kind behavior are discussed in the next section. Additionally, our
temperature variation of κ₁(0)/κ₁(T_(c)) ≈ 1.16 found for samples No.
1-No. 3 coincides with the result of Ref. [3]. At the same time the
obtained κ₁(T) changes are smaller than these of κ₂(T) and the
corresponding ratio is κ₂(0)/κ₂(T_(c)) ≈ 1.32. The κ₂(T) behavior is
practically invariant for all samples changing in contradiction with the
previous theoretical and experimental results (see, e.g., Refs. [39,
40]). Indeed, although according to Ref. [39] the differences in the
behavior of κ₁ and κ₂ should depend both on the ratio ξ/l, and

#### iii.2.3 Anomalies of charge transport and of thermodynamic
parameters near T^(*)

The formation of two-level systems in higher borides was for the first
time observed experimentally in rare earth dodecaborides LuB₁₂[2] and
ZrB₁₂[50] which are composed of a rigid framework formed by boron
nanoclusters B₁₂ and heavy ions embedded in cavities arranged by B₂₄
cuboctahedra. In Raman spectra of single crystalline Lu^(N)B₁₂[2] and
Zr^(N)B₁₂[85] samples with a different isotopic composition of boron (N
= 10, 11, _nat_) it was shown that the Raman response exhibits a boson
peak at liquid nitrogen temperatures and such a feature in the
low-frequency range is a fingerprint of systems with strong structural
disorder. To explain the properties of LuB₁₂, the authors of Ref. [2]
have proposed a model of cage-glass formation with a phase transition at
T^(*)∼ 50-70 K, and it was found that the barrier height of the
double-well potential ΔE [Fig. 15(c)] is practically equal to the
cage-glass transition temperature T^(*). Moreover, it has been shown
very recently [86] that there is an extra source of lattice instability
in LuB₁₂ related to the Jahn-Teller effect of B₁₂ clusters, which
manifests the displacements of Lu atoms in oversized B₂₄ cages and
results in cooperative dynamic Jahn-Teller lattice distortions and
conduction band changes. Similar effects are expected in the other
higher borides, including hexaborides. As a result, the temperature
lowering at T < T^(*) leads to displacements of metallic ions from their
centrosymmetric positions inside the B₂₄ cubocathedra [see, e.g., Fig.
15(d) for RB₆]. The result is a static disorder in the arrangement of
R³⁺ ions while maintaining the rigid covalent boron framework. The
presence of two-level systems with a barrier ΔE ∼ 90 K was reliably
demonstrated also in LaB₆ and in Ce_(x)La_(1 − x)B₆ solid solutions
based on low-temperature heat capacity measurements [48,49].
Furthermore, a pseudogap [87] and a low-frequency peak in inelastic
light scattering spectra [88,89] were found in LaB₆. Taking into account
that the ionic radius of yttrium r_(i)(Y³⁺) ∼ 1.04 A is significantly
lower than that of La³⁺ (r_(i) ∼ 1.17 A), which points to loosely bound
states of Y³⁺ ions in the boron sublattice, a strong nonequilibrium
state with a considerable structural disorder together with formation of
TLSs having a low barrier height can be expected for YB₆. Moreover, the
observed ratio B/Y (about 6.1 [9]) in the YB₆, which is large compared
to the stoichiometric value for hexaborides, suggest the presence of a
large number of vacancies in the sublattice of yttrium which prevails
the vacancy concentration on B₆ sites.

The above estimated barrier height of the double-well potential TLS₂ΔE₂≈
50 K (Table IV) should be therefore related to the glass transition
temperature T^(*)∼ 50 K which corresponds to the occurrence of
structural disorder in the subsystem of Y³⁺ ions in YB₆. Detailed
measurements of sample No. 1 were undertaken to investigate the heat
capacity of YB₆ in the vicinity of the phase transition. With the aim to
identify the anomaly at T^(*) one needs to compensate the strong
quasilinear C(T) decrease observed above 60 K to demonstrate the feature
at T^(*)∼ 50 K. When describing the experimental C(T) curve by a linear
approximation C(T) = AT + B found in the range 65-100 K (Fig. 3) the
anomaly at T^(*)≈ 55 K becomes clearly discerned slightly above the
steplike Einstein-type component [see inset in Fig. 3(a)]. At the same
time also features found in the vicinity of T^(*)∼ 50 K on the
temperature dependences of Hall coefficient R_(H)(T) (Fig. 10) and on
Seebeck coefficient S(T) (Fig. 11) should be considered as anomalies
that arise near this phase transition. Among features detected in YB₆
just below T^(*)∼ 50 K the authors of Ref. [3] point to a dramatic
decrease of the linear thermal expansivity, and a significant amplitude
lowering of the low-frequency Raman peak at 70 cm⁻¹ was observed in the
temperature range 30-60 K in Ref. [52]. It is worth noting that unlike
to cage glasses LuB₁₂ and LaB₆ in which high charge carrier motilities
μ_(H)∼ 2500 cm²/(V s) [90] and ∼21 000 cm²/(V s) [91] were observed,
respectively, in YB₆ the proximity to lattice instability and the
resultant stronger structural disorder cause a dramatic suppression of
Hall mobility. In the samples No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 with
different concentrations of boron vacancies n_(v) and of paramagnetic
centers N₁ = N_(n0) (see Tables IV and V) the low-temperature mobility
values are small enough and they do not exceed 50 cm²/(V s) (insets in
Fig. 10). Moreover, in sample No. 4 the mobility at liquid helium
temperature reaches only a value of 20 cm²/(V s) [inset in Fig. 10(c)].
These mobility values correspond to a very small value of the relaxation
time τ_(e) = 1.3-2.8 × 10⁻¹⁴ s and of the mean free path of the charge
carriers l = 11-58 A (Table III). Additionally, the close to square root
power-law dependence μ_(H) ∼ T^(−α) (α∼ 0.5) of the mobility in YB₆ (see
insets in Fig. 10) is significantly weaker than those observed in LuB₁₂
(α ∼ 2.06) [90] and LaB₆ (α ∼ 3) [91]. It is also worth noting that
substantial structural distortions in YB₆ were detected by
low-temperature Raman studies [52].

To analyze the features of charge transport and of thermodynamic
characteristics near T^(*) the relation

$$S_{\rm ph}=(C_{\rm ph}/ne)[1+\tau_{\rm e,ph}/\tau]^{-1},$$
(18)

which connects the Hall coefficient R_(H) = −1/ne, the phonon drag
thermopower $S_{\rm ph}$, and the phonon contribution to the heat
capacity $C_{\rm ph}$[92], was used [in relation (18) $\tau_{\rm e,ph}$
and τ denote the electron-phonon relaxation time and the relaxation time
of the phonon gas, respectively]. Using the experimental results of
Figs. 3, 10, and 11 it is then possible to obtain an estimation of the
temperature dependence of the factor [1 +
$\tau_{\rm e,ph}/\tau]^{-1}=S/[(C-\gamma T)R_{H}]$, which determines the
relative change of relaxation times in the system of conduction
electrons. It can be seen in Fig. 17 that the parameter [1 +
$\tau_{\rm e,ph}/\tau]^{-1}$ of YB₆ samples passes through a maximum in
the vicinity of T^(*) ∼ 50 K and that the cage-glass transition
temperature T^(*) corresponds to a sharp change in charge carriers
scattering. In the cage-glass phase at temperatures below 20 K, where
charge carriers scattering by impurities and structural defects becomes
dominant (ρ₀ ≈ const and $\tau_{\rm e,ph}\approx const$, see Fig. 2 and
insets in Fig. 10), we observed a strong power-law dependence of [1 +
$\tau_{\rm e,ph}/\tau]^{-1}\sim T^{-5}$ which should correspond to the
scattering in the phonon subsystem [93]. A detailed quantitative
analysis of the charge transport anomalies requires a correct separation
of two contributions to Seebeck coefficient–the negative (Mott-type)
diffusion thermopower and the phonon drag effect on the Einstein
modes–which is beyond the scope of this paper and will be published
elsewhere. At the same time, the temperature dependence of [1 +
$\tau_{\rm e,ph}/\tau$]⁻¹ = S/[(C − γT)R_(H)] (Fig. 17) allows us to
confirm that in YB₆ there are two phase transitions–at T^(*) ∼ 50 K and
at T_(c) ∼ 4.2-7.6 K–into the cage-glass state and into the
superconducting state, correspondingly.

#### 4. Factors responsible for the T_(c) dispersion

To quantify the offset from the stoichiometric composition state in YB₆
one can use parameters N_(E) and N₂ which were found from the heat
capacity analysis shown in Fig. 15 by Eqs. (15) and (16) and determine
the number of vacancies in Y and B sublattices, respectively. The
concentration of vacancies of yttrium
$n_{x}(\rm Y)=1-N_{E}\approx 3$-5.5% and boron
$n_{x}(\rm B)=N_{2}/4\approx 0.25$−1.1% of samples under investigation
are given in Table 4. The resulting chemical composition (see Table 4)
is then ∼Y_(0.95)B_(5.94) (for samples No. 1 and No. 2),
Y_(0.96)B_(5.95) (for sample No. 3), and Y_(0.97)B_(5.98) (for sample
No. 4) and provides a Y/B ratio in the range of 6.15-6.25. This ratio is
in agreement with the abovementioned results of Ref. [9] and allows us
to link the variations of T_(c) with significant deviations from the
hexaboride stoichiometry both in the yttrium and boron subsystem. Thus,
taking into account the x-ray density g_(m) = 3.705 g/cm³, which within
experimental accuracy remains equal for all investigated YB₆ crystals,
one can estimate from the heat capacity analysis made above (see Fig.
15) the mass density values g_(m)^(C) = 3.57-3.64 g/cm³ of samples No.
1-4 (see Table 4 and Fig. 14) by the relation

$$g_{m}^{C}=\frac{([1-n_{x}(\rm Y)]m_{Y}+6[1-n_{x}(\rm B)]m_{B})1.66057\times 1 0^{-24}}{a_{0}^{3}\times 10^{-24}},$$
(19)

where a₀ is the lattice parameter, and $m_{\rm Y}$ and $m_{\rm B}$
denote the atomic mass of yttrium and boron, correspondingly. Results of
independent hydrostatic density measurements of No. 1-No. 3 crystals are
also shown in Table 4 and in Fig. 14. As can be seen from Table 4 and
Fig. 14, the parameters g_(m)^(C) and g_(m) are in good agreement with
each other, and, as expected, the lower density observed for samples No.
1 and No. 2 meets the higher concentration of vacancies on yttrium and
boron sites.

From these results a direct correlation between the development of the
structural instability in YB₆ crystals and their transition temperature
T_(c) can be seen. Namely, the nonequilibrium state is stabilized in
crystals No. 1 and No. 2 by a higher concentration of vacancies in
yttrium and boron sublattices, corresponding to higher transition
temperature values T_(c) = 7.4-7.55 K. On the other side, the lower
transition temperature values T_(c) = 6.6 K and 4.2 K observed in
samples No. 3 and No. 4, respectively, correspond to a lower
concentration of Y and B vacancies in these more stoichiometric YB₆
crystals. Taking into account that the YB₆ lattice is stabilized in the
inhomogeneity range by introducing structural defects (vacancies), the
near stoichiometric crystals No. 3 and No. 4 are more unstable, they are
nonequilibrium ones. Moreover, in samples No. 3 and No. 4 there is an
additional superconductivity suppression mechanism associated with
Cooper pairs breaking by scattering on localized magnetic moments of
vacancy complexes, but this factor is not the decisive one. When
comparing the superconducting characteristics of YB₆ samples (Tables 1
and 2), we can note that crystals No. 3 and No. 4 with the highest
paramagnetic

Figure 17: Temperature dependences of the parameter S/[(C − γT)R_(H)]

data by exponential dependence ∼T⁻⁵ (see text). Arrows indicate the

temperatures.

response have the smallest T_(c) and $H_{\rm cm}$ values, but the upper
critical field H_(c2)(0) and the derivative dH_(c2)/dT(T_(c)) of these
two samples are the highest. Samples No. 3 and No. 4 exhibit also the
highest values of Ginzburg-Landau-Maki parameters κ₁ and κ₂ [Fig. 13],
together with the lowest amplitude of the ΔC jump near T_(c) (Table 1
and Fig. 14) and a significant broadening of the heat capacity anomaly
(Fig. 4).

Considering a significant softening of the low-frequency phonon modes
with temperature lowering in YB₆ found in Ref. [94], we may expect a
relation between the softening and the enhancement of electron-phonon
interaction, leading to a T_(c) increase in samples No. 1 and No. 2.
Authors of Ref. [94] pointed out that just above the transition to
superconducting state the low-frequency branches in Raman spectra
exhibit energies of ∼42 cm⁻¹ (∼5 meV) and ∼60-70 cm⁻¹ (∼8 meV).
Similarly, when creating the Eliashberg function α²(ω)F(ω) from
tunneling spectra measured on YB₆ single crystals with T_(c) ≈ 7.1 K,
two features were found on α²(ω)F(ω) in Ref. [35]–a "shoulder" at 4.9
meV and a broad peak in the vicinity of 8.5 meV. In addition, authors of
Ref. [35] estimated the electron-phonon interaction constant
$\lambda_{\rm e,ph}\approx 0.9$. Similar values of the energy of
Einstein oscillators Θ_(E1) ≈ 51 K (∼4.5 meV) and Θ_(E2) ≈ 90 K (∼8 meV)
in YB₆ were obtained from the analysis of phonon heat capacity in Ref.
[3]. Taking into account the results of the present study, it seems to
be reasonable that the above features observed experimentally at ∼50 K
should be associated with the barrier value of the double-well potential
ΔE₂ (Table 4) which corresponds to the cage-glass transition temperature
T^(*) ≈ ΔE₂/k_(B) ≈ 50 K. Moreover, the barrier ΔE₂/k_(B) ≈ 50 K may be
associated with a pseudogap in the YB₆ superconductor. Note that the
barrier ΔE₂/k_(B) ≈ 90 K found in Refs. [48] and [49] for LaB₆
correlates very well with the pseudogap value Δ/k_(B) ≲ 100 K detected
in Ref. [87] for this hexaboride. Thus, in accordance with the
conclusions of Refs. [3] and [35], the formation of Cooper pairs in YB₆
crystals with the highest T_(c) occurs through the electron-phonon
interaction with quasilocal vibrations of yttrium ions with energies
Θ_(E) ≈ 8 meV. Using parameters
$(\omega_{\rm Ba})\approx\Theta_{E}\approx 97.2$ K,
$\lambda_{\rm e,ph}\approx 0.96$ obtained in this work in the strong
coupling limit and taking the Coulomb pseudopotential μ^(*) ∼ 0.07,
within the framework of the relation for superconducting transition
temperature [95]

$$k_{B}T_{c}=\frac{\hbar\langle\omega_{\rm Ba}\rangle}{1.2}\text{exp}\bigg{[}- \frac{1.04(1+\lambda_{\rm e,ph})}{\lambda_{\rm e,ph}-\mu^{*}(1+0.62\lambda_{ \rm e,ph})}\bigg{]},$$
(20)

we obtain T_(c) ≈ 7.3 K, which correlates very well with
T_(c) = 7.4-7.55 K observed for crystals No. 1 and No. 2 of YB₆. Taking
into account the only small variation of the concentration of conduction
electrons (Fig. 10) one may expect only minor changes of the Coulomb
pseudopotential μ^(*) ∼ 0.07 in YB₆ superconductors. Then, knowing μ^(*)
and $\lambda_{\rm e,ph}$ for crystals No. 1-No. 4 [Fig. 14] it is useful
to compare the ratio
$T_{c}/\langle\omega_{\rm Ba}\rangle=f\langle\lambda_{\rm e,ph}\rangle$
estimated for these samples from Eq. (20) with the universal ones
describing the well-known experiments and calculations for strong
coupling superconductors with $\lambda_{\rm e,ph}<1.5$[95]. Figure 18
shows a good agreement in the $T_{c}/\langle\omega_{\rm Ba}\rangle$ vs
$\lambda_{\rm e,ph}$ scaling of Pb-Tl-Bi, In-Tl, Sn, Hg, Ga, V, Nb, Mo,
W, and Nb₃Sn data from Ref. [95] with these of YB₆ crystals No. 1 and
No. 2 together with the approximation of samples No. 1-No. 4 by Eq. (20)
using both μ^(*) ∼ 0.07 and μ^(*) ∼ 0.1. This scaling supports the
conclusion about superconductivity in the regime of strong coupling in
YB₆ and allows us to estimate roughly the parameter
$\langle\omega_{\rm Ba}\rangle\sim 1500$ K  ∼ Θ_(D) ≈ 1160 K for crystal
No. 4. Certainly, the huge increase of $\langle\omega_{\rm Ba}\rangle$
from ∼100 K (crystals No. 1 and No. 2) to ∼1500 K in crystal No. 4
argues in favor of the development of a strong lattice instability in
more stoichiometric yttrium hexaboride. Indeed, both the resistivity and
the heat capacity temperature dependences demonstrate a strong
renormalization of the electron-phonon interaction between samples No. 1
and No. 2, on one side, and No. 4, on the other side, together with a
shift of anomalies of both the resistivity derivative dρ/dT and the heat
capacity along the T axis to higher temperatures [see Figs. 16(a) and
16(b), correspondingly]. It can be seen from Fig. 14 that the depression
of superconductivity is accompanied by an increase of mass density and a
decrease of deviation from stoichiometry in YB₆ crystals demonstrating
that vacancies both in boron and yttrium sites serve as a stabilizing
factor in the nonequilibrium hexaboride lattice with enhanced
electron-phonon interaction.

### Residual resistivity in YB₆

To explain the lower values of residual resistivity ρ₀ in samples No. 1
and No. 2 where higher T_(c) values were observed (Fig. 2) in
combination with higher concentrations of boron and yttrium vacancies
(Table 4), the stabilizing effect of vacancies on the nonequilibrium
crystal structure of YB₆ may be considered. Within this approach, more
stoichiometric compositions appeared in crystals No. 3 and No. 4 are
characterized

Figure 18: The universal $T_{c}/\langle\omega_{\rm Ba}\rangle$ vs
$\lambda_{\rm e,ph}$ scaling demonstrates the well-known experiments and
calculations for strong coupling superconductors with
$\lambda_{\rm e,ph}<1.5$ (Pb-Tl-Bi, In-Tl, Sn, Hg, Ga, V, Nb, Mo, W, and
Nb₃Sn, see Ref. [95] for details) together with the results of this
study for YB₆ crystals. The approximation by Eq. (20) is shown for
μ^(*) ∼ 0.07 and μ^(*) ∼ 0.1.

by a development of _bcc_ lattice instability which leads to strong
lattice distortion and disordering effects, reinforcing the charge
carrier scattering on structural defects and their complexes and, as a
result, to a higher residual resistivity. Indeed, vacancy complexes can
be namely considered as nonpoint defects which provide significant
structural distortions and are also related to magnetic moments of
∼2.8-4.3 μ_(B) (see Table 5). Structural distortions near these clusters
of defects, along with a ρ₀ increase, lead also to an increase of heat
capacity and to broadening of C(T) features’ at T_(c) seen in crystals
No. 3 and No. 4 (Fig. 4).

## V Conclusions

A correlation of experimental results obtained from resistivity, Hall
and Seebeck coefficients, heat capacity, magnetization, and hydrostatic
density measurements of YB6 allowed us to assume the transition into an
unusual cage-glass state at T^(*) ∼ 50 K in which the yttrium ions are
displaced from their central positions in boron B₂₄ cubootcaehedra and
located randomly in these cavities of the rigid covalent boron
sublattice. We have shown that the number of vacancies on boron
(0.25-1.1

Moreover, from comprehensive and detailed studies of the superconducting
and normal state properties we have determined a set of parameters
including the electron-phonon interaction constant λ_(sp-ph) =
0.32-0.96, the critical (H_(c1) and H_(c2)) and thermodynamic (H_(cm))
magnetic fields, the coherence length ξ(0)∼ 320-340 A, the penetration
depth λ(0)∼ 1100-3250 A and the mean free path l = 11-58 A, the
Ginzburg-Landau-Maki parameters κ_(1, 2)(0)∼ 3.3-9.5, the
superconducting gap Δ(0)∼ 6.2-14.8 K, and the ratio 2Δ(0)/k_(B)T_(c)∼
3-4. This set of parameters points in favor of type II superconductivity
in the "dirty limit" ξ ≫ l with a medium to strong electron-phonon
interaction and s-type pairing of the charge carriers in the
nonequilibrium yttrium hexaboride.
