###### Abstract

We have investigated the anisotropic resistivities of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} using detwinned crystals with various oxygen contents (6.68 \leq7 -y\leq 6.93). The out-of-plane resistivity \rho_{e} shows a crossover from high-T metallic to low-T semiconducting behavior while the in-plane resistivity \rho_{a} deviates in the low-T region from T-linear dependence. We find that the crossover in \rho_{c} is linked with the onset of nonlinearity in \rho_{a}, which seems to be associated with the "spin gap" suggested by neutron and NMR studies.

Recently, an explanation of the in-plane charge transport in high-T_{c} cuprates in relation to the spin excitations has been put forth, based on the results of the in-plane resistivity \rho_{ab}(\rho_{a})(T) and Hall coefficient R_{H}(T) measured on YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (Ref. 1) and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}.[2] In both systems, \rho_{a} for the crystals in the underdoped regime deviates from the T-linear behavior and R_{H} from the 1/T one below a certain temperature well above the superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}). The deviation was found to correspond to the gap formation in the spin excitation spectrum suggested by neutron and NMR studies.[3, 4]

The out-of-plane resistivity \rho_{c} of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} has been investigated by many researchers, which revealed that both the magnitude and T dependence of \rho_{c} are very sensitive to the oxygen content[5, 6] and that \rho_{c} shows semiconducting temperature dependence except for y\sim0. However, the origin of the semiconducting out-of-plane conduction is still in dispute. In order to get insight into this problem, we have measured the anisotropic resistivities using untwinned crystals of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (6.68\leq7 -y\leq 6.93) and established how the magnitudes and T dependences of in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity vary with carrier concentration. The present work reveals that the metallic-to-semiconducting crossover in \rho_{c} correlates with the deviation from the T-linear behavior in \rho_{a}.

Single crystals of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} were grown by a self-flux method using a Y_{2}O_{3} crucible. We obtained single-domain crystals by picking up as-grown twin-free crystals from the crucible or by applying uniaxial stress on the twinned crystals. The oxygen content of crystals was controlled by annealing them at 600 degC for 12 h in a sealed quartz tube together with about 10 g of polycrystalline YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} which had a prescribed oxygen content. After annealing, the crystals in a quartz tube were slowly cooled in order to reduce oxygen disorder in the chain site.[1] The annealing condition mentioned above was crucial to avoid introducing twins into the twin-free crystals. The observation by the polarized optical microscope and the single-crystalline x-ray diffraction confirm that the detwinning was perfect. These procedures enable us to obtain untwinned crystals for any oxygen content, which produce highly reproducible and systematic transport data.

In this experiment, in-plane resistivities \rho_{a} and \rho_{b} were measured on an _untwinned_ crystal by the two-dimensional Montgomery method and out-of-plane resistivity \rho_{c} (and \rho_{ab}) was measured on a _twinned_ crystal by the tetragonal-symmetry Montgomery method.[7] In the latter case, since the domain size is much smaller than the sample dimensions, we can safely treat the sample as a pseudotetragonal one. We measured several crystals with the same oxygen content to confirm that the scattering of the data is within the dimensional errors. All of the experimental results are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. With increasing oxygen content, the resistivities in all the directions decrease. Evidences for high quality

 of the present crystals are given by a narrow superconducting transition, a large a-b anisotropy, and the smallest residual resistivity components in all directions (T_{c}\sim 92 K with \Delta< 1 K for 7\,\  the coherent motion and the electronic system becomes three-dimensional.

In order to examine any correlation between in-plane and out-of-plane conduction, we plot the data as [\rho_{c(a)}(T)-\rho_{c(a)}(0)]/\alpha_{c(a)}T vs T in Fig. 4. Here, \alpha_{c(a)} and \rho_{c(a)}(0) are slope and intercept, respectively, when the metallic part of \rho_{c(a)} is approximated by the formula \rho_{c(a)}(T)=\alpha_{c(a)}T+\rho_{c(a)}(0). From these figures we notice that the crossover to the nonmetallic regime in \rho_{c} is obviously linked with the the crossover from the T-linear to the nonlinear regime in \rho_{a} . The onsets of the anomaly in \rho_{a} and \rho_{c} , T_{a0} and T_{c0}, do not exactly coincide--T_{c0} is higher than T_{a0}, perhaps because \rho_{c} is more sensitive to an underlying mechanism which causes these anomalies or the above approximation for the metallic part is not good for \rho_{c} . In any case, this correlation is suggestive of the common origin for these crossovers, which leads to the rapid increase of \rho_{c}/\rho_{a} in the low-temperature region for oxygen-reduced compounds. It is curious that one physical effect acts on the in-plane and out-of-plane conduction in the opposite direction.

In a previous paper [1] we have given a possible explanation of the in-plane charge transport, based on the correspondence between the deviation from the T-linear dependence in \rho_{a} and the gap formation in the spin excitation spectrum. The present experimental results, therefore, suggest that the spin gap might be responsible also for the crossover behavior in \rho_{c}(T). In the region where the spin gap closes, at high temperatures or at higher doping levels, spin fluctuations would give rise to the T-linear in-plane resistivity as well as the metallic T dependence of the interplane conduction. When the spin gap opens (or spin pseudogap deepens), the suppressed spin fluctuations would reduce in-plane scattering, leading to the decrease in \rho_{a} . However, it is not straightforward that the spin gap might lead to the semiconducting \rho_{c} .

One possibility is the scenario of the resonating valence bond (RVB) theory, [13, 14] where one electron dissociates into a spinon-holon pair in the CuO_{2} plane, and the in-plane current is carried by holons which are scattered by spinons. On the other hand, the c-axis transport is dominated by hopping of one physical electron between the planes; a holon combines with a spinon to hop between the planes and again dissociate into the spinon-holon pair in another plane. Thus, a gap (or more appropriately a pseudogap) in the spinon density of states, suppresses the interplane hopping and gives rise to semiconducting \rho_{c}(T). Recent optical experiments on the 60-K material by Homes _et al._[15] have revealed that the out-of-plane optical conductivity spectrum \sigma_{c}(\omega) shows a clear pseudogap behavior--\sigma_{c} below \sim200 cm^{-1} is depressed as the temperature decreased below 300 K--while it is not observed in the in-plane spectrum. The pseudogap in the \sigma_{c}(\omega) spectrum deepens with decreasing temperature and is consistent with the T dependence of the dc transport.

A highly anisotropic Fermi-liquid picture which incorporates interplanar disorder, both static and dynamic, has recently been proposed as a counter model of the non-Fermi-liquid pictures of high-T_{c} cuprates. [16, 17] In this scenario, the c-axis electronic conduction is determined by the competition between direct and random hopping; the former originates from interplane hopping matrix t_{\perp} which is reduced, e.g., by electronic interactions, the latter from interplanar disorders V, respectively. The interplanar disorders would predominantly arise from the static defects in the CuO chains and from the dynamic out-of-plane phonons (or c-axis spin-fluctuation mode). This picture explains the overall features of \rho_{c} observed in the present experiment: The interplanar disorder decreases as one approaches YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, so the direct hopping process would dominate at the optimal doping, giving a metallic \rho_{c} . Contrary to this, he hopping assisted by the dynamical interplanar disorder, such as phonons, would dominate in the underdoped regime, and as a consequence a negative d\rho_{c}/dT would result in the T range above T_{c} . In the same T range, the dynamical interplanar disorder contributes to the in-plane transport as an additional scattering process, making \rho_{a} nonlinear with T. However, it is not clear whether this mechanism can explain the crossover to metallic T dependence of \rho_{c} at high temperatures.

There are other mechanisms proposed to explain the nonmetallic conduction in the c direction with emphasis on in-plane fluctuations. One of them incorporates in-plane superconducting fluctuations. [18, 19] In a layered superconductor, the in-plane resistivity is reduced, while the out-of-plane hopping is suppressed near T_{c} , due to superconducting fluctuations. However, the effect of the superconducting fluctuations should become apparent at higher temperature for higher-T_{c} material, which is just opposite to the observed trend of the crossover. Leggett has proposed an explanation of the c-axis charge dynamics based on the "dynamical dephasing" model. [20] In a highly anisotropic system where the in-plane (t_{ab}) hopping matrix is much larger than the interplane (t_{c}) one, in-plane thermal fluctuations with energy

Here, \alpha_{i} and \rho_{c}(0) are the slope and intercept, respectively, when the metallic part of \rho_{i} is approximated with a T-linear one. The inset shows how \rho_{c}(0) varies with oxygen content. Note that \rho_{c}(0) radically increases with reduced oxygen content, whereas \rho_{a}(0) does not with vanishingly small values for higher oxygen contents.

  larger than t_{c} break the band degeneracy in adjacent planes, therefore, coherent c-axis transport is destroyed. In this scenario, the dephasing occurs for k_{B}T{\approx}t_{c}, so it cannot explain the high-T metallic regime of \rho_{c} either.

We should note that similar features are observed also in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}.[21] nonlinear T dependence of \rho_{ab} in the underdoped regime and the high-T metallic to low-T semiconducting crossover in \rho_{c} at a certain temperature which rapidly decreases with increasing x. In this case the increase in hole density, the Sr substitution, introduces disorder in the LaO layers, contrary to the case of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} where the increase in hole density reduces the disorder in the CuO chains. Thus, the observed progression of the c-axis conduction with doping appears to be a property of the high-T_{c} cuprates, irrelevant to how disorders are introduced into the system. Different from the present system, the crossover in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} coincides with the structural phase transition[22] and the spin gap such as that in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} has not so far been identified.[23] Detailed investigations of the spin excitations and the connection with the structural distortions are necessary for the La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system.

In summary, we have presented anisotropic transport data of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} for various oxygen contents. Our results reveal the correlation between the semiconducting behavior in \rho_{c} and the nonlinearity in \rho_{a}. This correlation is most likely ascribed to the spin gap and suggests that the out-of-plane conduction in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} can be determined predominantly by spin fluctuations.
