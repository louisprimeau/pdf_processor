###### Abstract

We present the results from a Raman transport and magnetization study on RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_Cu2O_10+_d_. This compound has been shown to exhibit the existence of superconducting and magnetic order. Unlike the other superconducting ruthenate cuprate, RuSr2_R_Cu2O_8. RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_Cu2O_10+_d_ contains a significant ferromagnetic component. We find that the peak in the low-field zero-field-cooled magnetization data increases with increasing Ce concentration. This increase is mirrored by an increase in the saturation magnetization at 9.5 kG. However, there is no direct correlation between these increases and the superconducting transition temperature. Furthermore, there are no well-defined changes in either the resistance or the thermopower data that can be correlated with the magnetic-ordering transition. A simple explanation for the increase in the saturation magnetization at 9.5 kG is that, similar to SrRuO3, the RuO2 layers in RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_Cu2O_10+_d_ are itinerant ferromagnetic metals. We show that the RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_Cu2O_10+_d_ transport data can be interpreted in terms of both the resistance and thermopower being dominated by the CuO2 layers. In this interpretation, the RuO2 layers only affect the resistance in the CuO2 layers via exchange coupling and possible spin scattering. The Raman spectra is essentially the same as that found in RuSr2_R_Cu2O_d_ and there is no evidence of Raman modes that can be associated with the R2_-_x_Ce_xO_2 substructure.

## I Introduction

It has recently been shown that both RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_Cu2O_10+_d_ and RuSr2_R_Cu2O_8 (_R_ = Gd, Eu) display superconducting and magnetic order with the magnetic-ordering temperature being up to four times greater than the superconducting transition temperature.[1, 2] These superconductors were discovered by Bauernfeind, Widder, and Braun[3, 4] and the unit cells are assumed to be similar to LaSr2Nd2-_x_Ce_Cu2O_10+_d_,[5] NbSr2Eu2-_x_Ce_Cu2O_10+_d_, and NbBa2_R_Cu2O_8. Most research effort has been focused on RuSr2_R_Cu2O_8 where a number of studies have reported that RuSr2_R_Cu2O_8 is a ferromagnetic superconductor.[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] This generated considerable interest because superconductivity cannot coexist with magnetic order without some form of accommodation, for example, via a spontaneous vortex phase or by a modulation of the respective order parameters.[10] However, a neutron powder-diffraction study showed that the low-field magnetic order in RuSr2GdCu2O8 is predominantly antiferromagnetic in the RuO2 layers and that there is a magnetic reorientation with increasing applied magnetic field.[15] A magnetization study on RuSr2EuCu2O8 showed that the magnetization data could be interpreted in terms of predominantly low-field antiferromagnetic order (0.05_m__B_/Ru at 5 K) and a spin reorientation to ferromagnetic order with increasing magnetic field.[16] In the case of RuSr2GdCu2O8 the remanent magnetization is higher [0.15_m__B_/Ru (Ref. [16]) or 0.115_m__B_/Ru (Ref. [17]) at 5 K] but is still within the upper estimate of a ferromagnetic component determined from a powder-neutron-diffraction study.[15]

Although, superconducting RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_Cu2O_10+_d_ has not been studied as extensively as RuSr2_R_Cu2O_8, it is apparent that it is more interesting because there is evidence that RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_xCu2O_10+_d_ is a ferromagnet.[18, 19] The temperature dependence of the magnetization and the saturation magnetization from RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_Cu2O_10+_d_ (_x_ = 0.4,0.6) have been interpreted in terms of localized Ru moments with significant spin canting.[1, 18] Furthermore, the data have been interpreted in terms of the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism where there is a spontaneous vortex phase for temperatures near the superconducting transition temperature.[19]

By comparison with the NbSr2Eu2-_x_Ce_xCu2O_10+_d_ and NbBa2_R_Cu2O_8 analogs, it is clear that there should be significant differences in the electronic and magnetic properties of RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_xCu2O_10+_d_ and RuSr2_R_Cu2O_8. This is apparent in Fig. 1 where the structures of RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_xCu2O_10+_d_ and RuSr2_R_Cu2O_8 are shown (based on the NbSr2R2_-_x_Ce_xCu2O_10+_d_ and NbBa2_R_Cu2O analogs[6]. The only significant structural difference between NbBa_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8} and RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} is that the RuO_{6} octahedra in RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} are known to be rotated about the c axis by \sim14^{\circ} (Refs. 8 and 11) (one study also reported a buckling of the Ru-O-Cu bond[11]). These rotations form coherent domains extending up to \sim20 nm. It is not known if the RuO_{6} octahedra in RuSr_{2}_{-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} is also rotated. It can be seen in Fig. 1 that RuSr_{2}R_Cu_{2}O_{8} is essentially a CuO_{2} bilayer superconductor. However, RuSr_{2}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (based on the reported NbSr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} structure) contains an R_{2-x}Ce_{x}O_{2} structure in between the CuO_{2} layers that is similar to that seen in the R_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} electron-doped T^{\prime} structure. The comparison is more evident in Fig. 1(c) where we show the R_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4}T^{\prime} structure. Thus, the transport and superconductivity behavior in the CuO_{2} layers might be expected to be similar to that of the single-CuO_{2}-layer superconductors. Unlike RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8}, the Ru atoms in RuSr_{2}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (based on the reported NbSr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} structure) are not directly above each other in the adjacent RuO_{2} layers. It is therefore likely that the Ru-Ru exchange energy in the c axis direction is significantly different.

We have performed a Raman transport and magnetization study of RuSr_{2}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} with the aim to understand the vibrational, magnetic, and superconducting behavior of RuSr_{2}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}. We show below that the saturation magnetization at 9500 G can be interpreted in terms of itinerant ferromagnetism in the RuO_{2} layers. Furthermore, the transport data are dominated by the CuO_{2} layers and there is possibly weak coupling between the carriers in the CuO_{2} layers and the RuO_{2} layers. We also show that the Raman modes are similar to those found in RuSr_{2}R_Cu_{2}O_{8}.

## 5 Experimental Details

The RuSr_{2}_R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}_ samples were made from a stoichiometric mixture of RuO_{2}, Sr(CO_{3})_{2}, CeO_{2}, CuO, and Gd_{2}O_{3} or Eu_{2}O_{3}. The samples were first annealed in air at 960 degC for 16 h and then (i) heated at 1010 degC in flowing {\rm N}_{2} for 10 h, (ii) heated at 1050 degC in flowing {\rm O}_{2} for 10 h and then (iv) heated at 1060 degC in flowing {\rm O}_{2} for seven days. The samples were then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 4 K/min. The sintering in {\rm N}_{2} gas is required to suppress the SrRuO_{3} phase.[4] This results in Sr_{2}_R_RuO_{6}, CeO_{2}, and CuO. A La_{1.87}Sr_{0.13}CuO_{4} sample was made from a stoichiometric mix of La_{2}O_{3}, Sr(NO_{3})_{2}, and CuO. The powder was annealed at 700 degC for 1 h and then pressed into pellets, which were heated at 990 degC, 1010 degC, and 1030 degC in air for 48 h.

The samples were characterized and the lattice parameters obtained, using x-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Co _K_{\alpha}_ x-ray tube. The La_{1.87}Sr_{0.13}CuO_{4} sample was single phase. There was no evidence of SrRuO_{3}, CeO_{2}, CuO, RuSr_{2}R_Cu_{2}O_{8}, Gd_{2}CuO_{4}, or Sr_{3}Ru_{2}O_{7} in the RuSr_{2}_R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}_ XRD patterns after the final 1060 degC synthesis. However, samples with _x_\leq0.8 displayed a small fraction of excess Sr_{2}GdRuO_{6} (<\sim7% for x = 0.5) with the excess Sr_{2}GdRuO_{6} systematically decreasing with increasing Ce concentration. There were also extra weak peaks for _x_\leq0.8 that could not be indexed to the RuSr_{2}_R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}_I4/mmm space group or other possible impurity phases. We show later that the small Sr_{2}GdRuO_{6} impurity fraction did not effect _T_{c}_ or the magnetization data.

The Raman data were obtained on ceramic-powder samples using the 514.5-nm line of a Ar-ion laser. The incident power was less than 20 mW. The incident light was vertically polarized and the scattered light was unpolarized. However, the polarization sensitivity of the double monochromator and the CCD detector meant that the detected light was predominantly vertically polarized. The resistance data was obtained using the four-terminal technique and the thermopower data was obtained using the standard differential method. The variable-temperature magnetization data were obtained using a vibrating-sample magnetometer for temperatures greater than 15 K and for magnetic fields of up to 10 000 G. One sample was also measured using a SQUID magnetometer.

A part of the RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} sample was annealed at 600 degC in 0.1% {\rm O}_{2} and 99.9 % {\rm N}_{2} gas for 14 h. The decrease in \delta was estimated from the change in mass to be 0.10 and there was no evidence of superconductivity. Another part of the RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} sample was annealed at 100 bars in oxygen for 12 h at 600 degC, ramped to 350 degC over 24 h, and annealed at 350 degC for 72 h. We observed a mass change corresponding to an increase in \delta of 0.07.

## 6 Results and Analysis

The RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} lattice parameters were, within experimental error, independent of Ce concentration. We found that a = (3.840 \pm 0.004) A and c = (28.58 \pm 0.03) A. These values are comparable to those reported by Bauernfeind, Widder, and Braun [_a_ = 3.836 A and c = 28.58 A (Ref. 3)]. It is particularly interesting to note that the _a_-axis lattice parameter is within the range of that observed in RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (Ref. 3)]. In the case of RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} it is assumed that the rotations of the RuO_{6} octahedra are driven by the large Ru-O-Ru bond length when compared with the Cu-O-Cu bond length. Thus, a similar _a_-axis lattice parameter in both RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} and RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} may indicate that RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} also has a rotation of the RuO_{6} octahedra.

We find that, while the structure of RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} contains the electron-doped T^{\prime}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}O_{2} substructure, there is no evidence of the corresponding phonon modes. This is apparent in Fig. 2 where we plot the room-temperature Raman spectra from RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}  596 cm^{-1}. The peaks in the Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} Raman spectra at 347 and 492 cm^{-1} have been attributed to B_{1g} and E_{g} vibrations of O(4), respectively, while the peak at 596 cm^{-1} is assigned as a A_{1g}+ peak, which may be due to O(4) sites in the structures that have been rotated to be directly above Cu.^{20} It can be seen in Fig. 2 that there is an additional broad peak near 400 cm^{-1} in the RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} Raman spectra, however, this peak is not near any of the expected R_{2-x}Ce_{x}O_{2} substructure peaks. The absence of O(4) vibrations in the RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} Raman spectra may be due to disorder from a variable Ce content and a variable oxygen content in the R_{2-x}Ce_{x}O_{2} substructure.

It can be seen in Fig. 3 that both the zero resistance, T_{c}(0), and the initial decrease in the resistance, T_{c}, vary systematically with increasing Ce concentration. This is clearer in the inset to Fig. 3(b) where we plot T_{c}(0) (open circles) and T_{c} (filled circles) against the Ce concentration. We find that T_{c}(0) and T_{c} are maximum for 0.6 Ce being 35 K and 50 K for RuSr_{2}Gd_{1-\delta}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}, respectively. In the case of RuSr_{2}Eu_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}, T_{c}(0) = 26 K and T_{c} = 49 K. The maximum T_{c}(0) and T_{c} values are higher than those reported by Felner _et al._ [\sim20 and 42 K for x = 0.6 and R = Gd (Ref. 1)] and are comparable to those of Bauernfield, Widder, and Braun [38 and 45 K for x = 0.5 and R = Gd (Ref. 3)]. The T_{c} values for RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} are also comparable to those in RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} [T_{c} = 45 K (Refs. 9 and 21)]. However, T_{c} for RuSr_{2}Eu_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} is significantly higher than that in RuSr_{2}Eu_{2}Cu_{2}O_{8} [T_{c} = 32 K (Refs. 16 and 21)]. It is interesting to note that the values of T_{c}(0) and T_{c} in RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} are also significantly higher than those reported in nonmagnetic NbSr_{2}Eu_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (\sim13 and \sim20 K, respectively^{5}). This may suggest that T_{c} is not being significantly affected by the magnetic order in the RuO_{2} layers (e.g., by possible magnetic pairbreaking).

It is apparent in Fig. 3 that the resistance data for all the as-made RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} samples display a semiconductorlike increase for low temperatures. However, in the case of RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}, which has the smallest increase, the semiconductorlike upturn disappears after oxygen loading at 100 bars as can be seen by the dotted curve in Fig. 3(a). The origin of the semiconductorlike upturn in oxygen-deficient samples is not clear. It may be partly due to oxygen depletion at the grain boundaries. We note that Bauernfeind, Widder, and Braun also observed the progressive development of a low-temperature semiconductorlike upturn with increasing oxygen deficiency.^{3}

The resistance transitions are much broader than those observed in many of the other HTSC. For example, the superconducting transition width is about 14 K for the as-made RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} sample. The superconducting transition width is broader than that observed by Bauernfeind, Widder, and Braun^{3} and it is comparable to that observed by Felner _et al.^{1}_ Furthermore, as can be seen in Fig. 3(b), the superconducting transition width is comparable to that observed in RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8}.^{21} Part of the superconducting transition width may be due to oxygen disorder in RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} and structural disorder in RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8}. However, we note that a broad superconducting transition is also expected within the spontaneous vortex phase model.

Unlike some other dopants in HTSC we find that most of the additional electrons introduced by Ce do not appear to be significantly altering the hole concentration on the CuO_{2} planes. This is apparent in the inset to Fig. 3(b) where it can

The resistance data have been vertically scaled to the same value at 220 K. Also shown is the resistance from the RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} sample, which was oxygen loaded at 100 bars [dotted curve, Fig. 4(a)], RuSr_{2}Eu_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} [dashed curve, Fig. 4(a)], and RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} [dashed curve, Fig. 4(b) (Ref. 21)]. Figure 4(b) inset: Plot of T_{c} and T_{c}(0) against Ce content.

  be seen that an increase in x from 0.4 to 0.8 results in a small increase and then decrease in T_{c} . If all of the electrons were doped onto the CuO_{2} planes then the hole concentration n should decrease by 0.2. However, by comparison with other HTSC,[22] a decrease in n by 0.2 should result in large changes in T_{c} . This is apparent by noting that most HTSC have been shown to follow the T_{c}(n) correlation, T_{c}(n) = T_{c,\max}[1 -82.6(n - 0.16)^{2}] where superconductivity occurs for 0.05 \leqslantn = 0.27.[22] Thus if RuSr_{2}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} is underdoped (n < 0.16) then T_{c} should decrease from 43 K for x = 0.4 to 0 for x > 0.6, which is obviously not the case. On the other hand, if we assume that RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} is overdoped, then by comparison with other HTSC, T_{c} should dramatically increase and then decrease. It is possible that, similar to Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Y_{x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta},[23] the additional electrons introduced by Ce^{4+} are partially compensated for by an increase in \delta. For example, an increase in x from 0.4 to 0.8 could be compensated for by an increase in \delta of 0.2. It is also possible that the additional electrons introduced by Ce^{4+} are appearing in the RuO_{2} layers. The possible effects of a change in \delta or a decrease in the Ru valence can be seen using simple valence counting. In the case of RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} it has been shown from a x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) study that the Ru valence is +4.6.[24] Thus, from simple valence counting, this gives a Cu valence of p = + 2.2, which is close to that of underdoped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. From the similar T_{c} values of RuSr_{2}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} and RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} we might expect that the Cu valence is also \sim + 2.2 in RuSr_{2}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}. Thus, using p = 0.5 + \delta + (y - x)/2, where 5 - y is the average Ru valence, assuming that p = + 2.2 and using y = 0 for x = 0.5,[25] we find that \delta = 0.03 for x = 0.5. It is possible that p = + 2.2 is maintained for increasing x by a corresponding increase in \delta.

We show later that there are significant changes in the low-field magnetization data commencing between 70 and 130 K, depending on the Ce concentration. If the RuO_{2} layers contributed significantly to the normal-state conductivity then we might expect the magnetic ordering in the RuO_{2} layers to be mirrored by a decrease in the resistance. This is observed in other ruthenate compounds.[26, 27, 28] For example, there is a decrease in the SrRuO_{3} resistance near the ferromagnetic-ordering temperature (160 K).[26] However, it is clear in Fig. 3 that it is not observed in RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}, even after the 100-bar anneal, and it is also not observed in RuSr_{2}R_{2}Cu_{2}O_{8}.[9, 12, 11] In the case of RuSr_{2}R_{2}Cu_{2}O_{8} the effect of the RuO_{2} layers is observed indirectly by magnetoresistance measurements.[12, 13] It is therefore possible that the RuO_{2} layers in RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} do not contribute directly to the normal-state conductivity (i.e., \sigma_{\rm RuO_{2}}\ll\sigma_{\rm CuO_{2}}).

We show in Fig. 4 that the thermopower also changes with increasing Ce concentration. It can be seen in the inset to Fig. 4(a) that the room-temperature thermopower initially decreases and then increases with increasing Ce concentration (filled circles). It had previously been argued in the case of RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} that the room-temperature thermopower S(300\,{\rm K}) of RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8}(\sim 60 \muV/K) is indicative of a very underdoped high-temperature superconductor (HTSC) [n \sim 0.065 (Ref. 9)]. This was based on the S(300\,{\rm K}) hole-concentration correlation,[29] which has been found for most of the HTSC's. A similar interpretation of S(300\,{\rm K}) for RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} would imply that RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} is a hole-doped HTSC and the maximum hole concentration is \sim0.10 for x = 0.6. However, there is a problem because according to the S(300\,{\rm K}) vs hole-concentration correlation, S(300\,{\rm K}) for RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} should systematically increase with increasing Ce concentration (i.e., decreasing hole concentration). It may be that like La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4},[30] RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} does not follow the S(300\,{\rm K}) vs hole-concentration correlation or the electrons introduced by Ce^{4+} are partially compensated for by an increase in \delta.

The effect of oxygen unloading is to increase S(300\,{\rm K}) while oxygen loading decreases S(300\,{\rm K}) as can be seen in Fig. 4(a) inset for the RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.6}Ce_{0.4}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} sample. The decrease in oxygen content for the oxygen unloaded sample corresponds to a maximum decrease in the hole concentration in the CuO_{2} planes of 0.10. It might be expected that a decrease in \delta of 0.10 is equivalent to a 0.20 increase in the

 Ce content. However, this does not appear to be the case because _S_(300 K) for the oxygen-reduced sample is even higher than that for the 1.0 Ce sample. We show later that changes in the magnetic order correlate with a decrease in d of 0.10 corresponding to an increase in x of 0.20.

The temperature dependence of the thermopower for RuSr_{2}_R_2_{-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} has features similar to those found in RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8}.[21, 3] In particular, _S_(_T_) is flat or initially increases with decreasing temperature. At a lower temperature of \sim170 K, _S_(_T_) begins to decrease for all the samples studied. This is clearer in the inset to Fig. 4(b) where we plot _dS_/_dT_ against temperature for RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (open circles). The normal-state temperature dependence of the derivative is essentially the same for all the superconducting RuSr_{2}_R_2_{-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} samples and is only different for nonsuperconducting RuSr_{2}_R_CeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (open up triangles). Although there is no generally accepted model for the thermopower in the HTSC, we believe that the thermopower is dominated by the CuO_{2} layers. In two of the other HTSC's, which contain CuO_{2} planes and conducting CuO chains or CuO ribbons, it has been shown that the thermopower can be modeled as _S_(_T_) = (_s_CaO_{2}/_s_T_)_S_CuO_{2} + (_s_CuO_{2}/_s_T_)_S_CuO_{2}, where _s_CaO_{2} is the conductivity from the CuO_{2} planes, _s_CaO is the conductivity from the CuO chain or ribbons, _s_CaO_{7} is the total conductivity, _S_CaO_{2} is the thermopower from the CuO_{2} planes, and _S_CaO is the thermopower from the CuO chain or ribbons.[30, 31, 32] Thus, the interpretation of the RuSr_{2}_R_2_{-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} resistance data in terms of _s_RuO_{2}*_s_CaO_{2} can lead to the thermopower being dominated by the CuO_{2} layers.

It is important to note that the decrease in the thermopower below \sim170 K does not imply that the decrease is somehow related to the magnetic order. This is apparent in Fig. 4(b) where we also plot the thermopower from undoped La_{1.87}Sr_{0.13}CuO_{4} (crosses). It can be seen that La_{1.87}Sr_{0.13}CuO_{4} displays general features similar to those seen in RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}, except that the decrease in _S_(_T_) occurs at a lower temperature (\sim130 K). Furthermore, as we show later, the peak in the zero-field-cooled magnetization and the saturation magnetization systematically increase with increasing Ce concentration. However, this is not reflected by changes in the temperature dependence of the thermopower.

The rapid decrease in _S_(_T_) for RuSr_{2}_R_2_{-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} at low temperatures signals the onset of superconductivity. We find that the zero-thermopower temperature (49 K for R = Gd and 41 K for R = Eu for x = 0.6) is close to _T__{c} as determined from the resistance data. Similar behavior is observed in RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8}, where zero thermopower occurs at \sim49 K, the resistance begins to decrease below 45 K, and a specific-heat jump is observed at 45 K.[9, 21]

It is apparent in Fig. 5(a) that there are systematic changes in the low-field zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization M2FC from RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} with increasing Ce concentration. In particular, there is a peak in M2FC at a temperature _T__{p}, which increases in temperature with increasing Ce concentration, and for higher temperatures there is a gradual decrease in M2FC with increasing temperature. Furthermore, this peak disappears with increasing magnetic field as can be seen in Fig. 5(b). Similar features were observed in RuSr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} for x = 0.5 and x = 0.6 where the data was interpreted in terms of localized Ru moment magnetic ordering at 180 K, slight spin canting below \sim170 K, and Ru-Ru and/or Gd-Ru interactions at lower temperatures.[19] However, as we show later, the saturation magnetization data at 9500 G can be interpreted in terms of itinerant ferromagnetism in the RuO_{2} layers. Unfortunately, there are no reports of neutron diffraction or very-high-field magnetization measurements, which would provide a better understanding of the magnetic order in RuSr_{2}_R_2_{-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}. In the absence of such data, we associate _T__{p} with the ferromagnetic ordering in the RuO_{2} layers. We note again that there was no evidence of SrRuO_{3} (magnetic-ordering temperature of 160 K) in the XRD pattern. There was some evidence of Gd_{2}SrRuO_{6} and Eu_{2}SrRuO_{6} but these phases do not magnetically order above 100 K.

We show in the inset to Fig. 5(b) that _T__{p} at 50 G increases systematically with increasing Ce concentration and there is no significant change for R = Gd (filled circles) or R = Eu (filled up triangles). It is not clear if the increase in _T__{p} is due to the additional holes going onto the RuO_{2} layers or structurally induced changes in the RuO_{2} layer band structure. A similar increase in the magnetic-ordering temperature has

(b) Plot of zero-field-cooled magnetization from RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} with H = 50, 250, and 1000 G. The arrow indicates increasing H.

Also shown is _T__{p} for the RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} sample annealed at 600 Â°C in 0.1%O_{2} (open circle) and at 100 bars (cross).

  been observed in Ca_{1-x}Sr_{x}RuO_{3} with increasing x for x> 0.3.[27, 33] However Ca and Sr have the same 2+ valence and hence the increase in T_{p} with increasing Ca concentration is not due to a simple doping effect. It is interesting to note that the removal of oxygen (i.e., the removal of holes) from RuSr_{2}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} has the same effect on T_{p} as an increase in Ce concentration (i.e., the removal of holes). This can be seen in the inset to Fig. 5(b) where we plot the data for the RuSr_{2}R_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} sample, which had been annealed at 600 degC in 0.1%O_{2} gas resulting in a decrease in \delta by 0.10 (open circle) or an equivalent increase in the Ce content of 0.20. Also shown in the inset to Fig. 5(b) is T_{p} for the RuSr_{2}R_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} sample annealed at 100 bars (cross symbol), which results in an increase in the oxygen content of 0.07. It can be seen that T_{p} decreases in a manner consistent with an equivalent decrease in the Ce content of 0.14.

We show in Fig. 6 that both RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} and RuSr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} display similar magnetic hysteresis with increasing applied magnetic field. Here we plot the magnetization against magnetic field for x = 0.8. The larger gradient observed for Gd is due to the large Gd moment. It can be seen that both the remanent magnetization and the coercive field decrease with increasing temperature. The resultant remanent magnetization is plotted in Fig. 7 for fully loaded RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (solid symbols) and RuSr_{2}Eu_{1.2}Ce_{0.8}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (solid curve). We find that the remanent magnetization from RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} falls onto a common curve for 0.6\leqx \leq 1.0 and is still finite for temperatures up to 100 K. Oxygen removal for x = 0.6 has no significant effect on the remanent magnetization as can be seen by the open circles in Fig. 7.

We show in Fig. 8 that the magnetization saturates for moderate magnetic fields (\sim2500 G) after which the magnetization increases slowly with increasing magnetic field. Here we plot the magnetization from RuSr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} [Fig. 8(a)] and RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} [Fig. 8(b)] at 16 K. The linear saturation of the magnetization observed in RuSr_{2}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} for magnetic fields above \sim2500 G and at 16 K can be contrasted with RuSr_{2}EuCu_{2}O_{8} [dashed curve in Fig. 8(a) and at 25 K (Ref. [16])], where the magnetization has not saturated for magnetic fields as high as 60 000 G. The magnetization for RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} has a slope that is much greater than that of RuSr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}, which is due to the Gd^{3+} moment. In the case of RuSr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}, the Van Vleck paramagnetism from Eu^{3+} at 16 K is too small to account for the increase in the magnetization above \sim2500 G. To characterize the saturation magnetization with increasing Ce concentration, we plot the magnetization at 9500 G and 16 K from RuSr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} in the inset to Fig. 7 (solid up triangles). Also plotted is the magnetization at 9500 G and 16 K from RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (filled circles) after subtraction of the Curie-Weiss term attributed to the Gd^{3+} moment, which is assumed to be 7 \mu_{B}/Gd (Ref. [2]) in RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8}. It can be seen that the saturation magnetization increases consistently for both

There are a number of similarities between the magnetic and electronic behavior of the RuO_{2} layers in SrRuO_{3}, RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8}, and RuSr_{2}F_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}. For example, the octahedral crystal field results in the 4_d^{4} band splitting to become a triplet (_t_{2g}_) state and a higher-energy doublet (_e_{g}_) valence band. Thus for Ru^{4+}, the ground state should have S = 1 and hence the saturation moment should be 2.0_m_\mu_{B}/Ru. However, in the case of SrRuO_{3} and RuSr_{2}EuCu_{2}O_{8} the saturation moment at 60 kG and 5 K is only ~1.3_m_\mu_{B}/Ru (Ref. [27]) and ~1_m_\mu_{B}/Ru (Ref. [16]), respectively. Interestingly, the moment per Ru in SrRuO_{3} has not saturated for magnetic fields as high as 300 kG [~1.4_m_\mu_{B}/Ru at 300 kG and 50 K (Ref. [27])]. In the case of SrRuO_{3} it is now believed that SrRuO_{3} is an itinerant ferromagnetic metal as well as a "bad" metal with a very small mean free path.[26, 27, 33] It is therefore possible that the RuO_{2} layers in both RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8} and RuSr_{2}F_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} display itinerant magnetic behavior. This interpretation is different from that suggested by a recent XANES study on RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8} where the data was interpreted in terms of a mixture of Ru^{4+} and Ru^{5+} ferrimagnetism and it was suggested that there is a double-exchange interaction in the RuO_{2} layers.[24] The double-exchange mechanism[34] has been invoked to explain the ferromagnetic transition in La_{1-x}Sr_{x}MnO_{3}, where the ordering is accompanied by a dramatic decrease in the resistivity.[35] For the double-exchange mechanism to be valid in RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8} and RuSr_{2}_R_2_{-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} we would expect a mixture of t_{2g}^{3}e^{1}(Ru^{4+}) and t_{2g}^{3}(Ru^{5+}) with S = 2 and S = 3/2, respectively. Therefore, we might expect the saturation magnetization to be between 4_m_\mu_{B}/Ru and 3_m_\mu_{B}/Ru. However, as mentioned above, the saturation magnetization at 9500 G and 16 K for RuSr_{2}F_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} is less than 1_m_\mu_{B}/Ru. Furthermore, the saturation magnetization at 60 000 G and 5 K for RuSr_{2}EuCu_{2}O_{8} is only ~1_m_\mu_{B}/Ru.

The itinerant ferromagnetic interpretation for RuSr_{2}_R_2_{-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} conveniently explains why the saturation magnetization is less than that expected within a local moment model and why the saturation magnetization varies systematically with increasing Ce concentration. A similar increase in both the saturation magnetization and the magnetic-ordering temperature is observed in Ca_{1-x}Sr_{x}RuO_{2} for x > 0.3 where, as mentioned earlier, the substitution of Sr^{2+} for Ca^{2+} is not expected to result in a simple doping effect. The changes observed in Ca_{1-x}Sr_{x}RuO_{3} have been interpreted in terms of band effects where the underlying interaction is assumed to be ferromagnetic.[26, 27, 33] The low-field antiferromagnetic order of RuSr_{2}R_Cu_{2}O_{8} and the spin-flip transition for higher applied fields indicates that the interactions are more complex in RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8}. Antiferromagnetic order is observed in another ruthenate, Sr_{2}GdRuO_{6}, but this ruthenate is also an insulator.

## Conclusion

We have shown that the RuSr_{2}_R_2_{-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} transport data can be interpreted in terms of the CuO_{2} layers dominating the electrical conductivity and the thermopower. There is possibly exchange coupling from the carriers in the RuO_{2} layers to the conduction-band carriers in the CuO_{2} layers, as is observed in RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8}. There is a low-field peak in the zero-field-cooled magnetization and the saturation magnetization increases with increasing Ce concentration. However, there is no direct correlation between these increases and the superconducting transition temperature, which may indicate that pairbreaking via coupling to the RuO_{2} layers is weak. Although the temperature dependence of the magnetization is complex we show, by comparing the saturation magnetization with that from other ruthenate compounds, that the magnetic order in the RuO_{2} layers can be interpreted in terms of itinerant ferromagnetism. The room-temperature Raman spectra display the same modes found in RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8} and there is no evidence of O(4) Raman modes that are observed in the electron-doped _T_'HTSC. This may be due to O(4) site disorder in the R2_{-x}Ce_{x}O_{2} layers, which could arise from a variable oxygen content in the R2_{-x}Ce_{x}O_{2} layers.

###### Abstract

We present the results from a Raman transport and magnetization study on RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_Cu2O_10+_d_. This compound has been shown to exhibit the existence of superconducting and magnetic order. Unlike the other superconducting ruthenate cuprate, RuSr2_R_Cu2O_8. RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_Cu2O_10+_d_ contains a significant ferromagnetic component. We find that the peak in the low-field zero-field-cooled magnetization data increases with increasing Ce concentration. This increase is mirrored by an increase in the saturation magnetization at 9.5 kG. However, there is no direct correlation between these increases and the superconducting transition temperature. Furthermore, there are no well-defined changes in either the resistance or the thermopower data that can be correlated with the magnetic-ordering transition. A simple explanation for the increase in the saturation magnetization at 9.5 kG is that, similar to SrRuO3, the RuO2 layers in RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_Cu2O_10+_d_ are itinerant ferromagnetic metals. We show that the RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_Cu2O_10+_d_ transport data can be interpreted in terms of both the resistance and thermopower being dominated by the CuO2 layers. In this interpretation, the RuO2 layers only affect the resistance in the CuO2 layers via exchange coupling and possible spin scattering. The Raman spectra is essentially the same as that found in RuSr2_R_Cu2O_d_ and there is no evidence of Raman modes that can be associated with the R2_-_x_Ce_xO_2 substructure.

## I Introduction

It has recently been shown that both RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_Cu2O_10+_d_ and RuSr2_R_Cu2O_8 (_R_ = Gd, Eu) display superconducting and magnetic order with the magnetic-ordering temperature being up to four times greater than the superconducting transition temperature.[1, 2] These superconductors were discovered by Bauernfeind, Widder, and Braun[3, 4] and the unit cells are assumed to be similar to LaSr2Nd2-_x_Ce_Cu2O_10+_d_,[5] NbSr2Eu2-_x_Ce_Cu2O_10+_d_, and NbBa2_R_Cu2O_8. Most research effort has been focused on RuSr2_R_Cu2O_8 where a number of studies have reported that RuSr2_R_Cu2O_8 is a ferromagnetic superconductor.[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] This generated considerable interest because superconductivity cannot coexist with magnetic order without some form of accommodation, for example, via a spontaneous vortex phase or by a modulation of the respective order parameters.[10] However, a neutron powder-diffraction study showed that the low-field magnetic order in RuSr2GdCu2O8 is predominantly antiferromagnetic in the RuO2 layers and that there is a magnetic reorientation with increasing applied magnetic field.[15] A magnetization study on RuSr2EuCu2O8 showed that the magnetization data could be interpreted in terms of predominantly low-field antiferromagnetic order (0.05_m__B_/Ru at 5 K) and a spin reorientation to ferromagnetic order with increasing magnetic field.[16] In the case of RuSr2GdCu2O8 the remanent magnetization is higher [0.15_m__B_/Ru (Ref. [16]) or 0.115_m__B_/Ru (Ref. [17]) at 5 K] but is still within the upper estimate of a ferromagnetic component determined from a powder-neutron-diffraction study.[15]

Although, superconducting RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_Cu2O_10+_d_ has not been studied as extensively as RuSr2_R_Cu2O_8, it is apparent that it is more interesting because there is evidence that RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_xCu2O_10+_d_ is a ferromagnet.[18, 19] The temperature dependence of the magnetization and the saturation magnetization from RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_Cu2O_10+_d_ (_x_ = 0.4,0.6) have been interpreted in terms of localized Ru moments with significant spin canting.[1, 18] Furthermore, the data have been interpreted in terms of the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism where there is a spontaneous vortex phase for temperatures near the superconducting transition temperature.[19]

By comparison with the NbSr2Eu2-_x_Ce_xCu2O_10+_d_ and NbBa2_R_Cu2O_8 analogs, it is clear that there should be significant differences in the electronic and magnetic properties of RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_xCu2O_10+_d_ and RuSr2_R_Cu2O_8. This is apparent in Fig. 1 where the structures of RuSr2R2_-_x_Ce_xCu2O_10+_d_ and RuSr2_R_Cu2O_8 are shown (based on the NbSr2R2_-_x_Ce_xCu2O_10+_d_ and NbBa2_R_Cu2O analogs[6]. The only significant structural difference between NbBa_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8} and RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} is that the RuO_{6} octahedra in RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} are known to be rotated about the c axis by \sim14^{\circ} (Refs. 8 and 11) (one study also reported a buckling of the Ru-O-Cu bond[11]). These rotations form coherent domains extending up to \sim20 nm. It is not known if the RuO_{6} octahedra in RuSr_{2}_{-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} is also rotated. It can be seen in Fig. 1 that RuSr_{2}R_Cu_{2}O_{8} is essentially a CuO_{2} bilayer superconductor. However, RuSr_{2}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (based on the reported NbSr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} structure) contains an R_{2-x}Ce_{x}O_{2} structure in between the CuO_{2} layers that is similar to that seen in the R_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} electron-doped T^{\prime} structure. The comparison is more evident in Fig. 1(c) where we show the R_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4}T^{\prime} structure. Thus, the transport and superconductivity behavior in the CuO_{2} layers might be expected to be similar to that of the single-CuO_{2}-layer superconductors. Unlike RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8}, the Ru atoms in RuSr_{2}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (based on the reported NbSr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} structure) are not directly above each other in the adjacent RuO_{2} layers. It is therefore likely that the Ru-Ru exchange energy in the c axis direction is significantly different.

We have performed a Raman transport and magnetization study of RuSr_{2}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} with the aim to understand the vibrational, magnetic, and superconducting behavior of RuSr_{2}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}. We show below that the saturation magnetization at 9500 G can be interpreted in terms of itinerant ferromagnetism in the RuO_{2} layers. Furthermore, the transport data are dominated by the CuO_{2} layers and there is possibly weak coupling between the carriers in the CuO_{2} layers and the RuO_{2} layers. We also show that the Raman modes are similar to those found in RuSr_{2}R_Cu_{2}O_{8}.

## 5 Experimental Details

The RuSr_{2}_R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}_ samples were made from a stoichiometric mixture of RuO_{2}, Sr(CO_{3})_{2}, CeO_{2}, CuO, and Gd_{2}O_{3} or Eu_{2}O_{3}. The samples were first annealed in air at 960 degC for 16 h and then (i) heated at 1010 degC in flowing {\rm N}_{2} for 10 h, (ii) heated at 1050 degC in flowing {\rm O}_{2} for 10 h and then (iv) heated at 1060 degC in flowing {\rm O}_{2} for seven days. The samples were then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 4 K/min. The sintering in {\rm N}_{2} gas is required to suppress the SrRuO_{3} phase.[4] This results in Sr_{2}_R_RuO_{6}, CeO_{2}, and CuO. A La_{1.87}Sr_{0.13}CuO_{4} sample was made from a stoichiometric mix of La_{2}O_{3}, Sr(NO_{3})_{2}, and CuO. The powder was annealed at 700 degC for 1 h and then pressed into pellets, which were heated at 990 degC, 1010 degC, and 1030 degC in air for 48 h.

The samples were characterized and the lattice parameters obtained, using x-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Co _K_{\alpha}_ x-ray tube. The La_{1.87}Sr_{0.13}CuO_{4} sample was single phase. There was no evidence of SrRuO_{3}, CeO_{2}, CuO, RuSr_{2}R_Cu_{2}O_{8}, Gd_{2}CuO_{4}, or Sr_{3}Ru_{2}O_{7} in the RuSr_{2}_R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}_ XRD patterns after the final 1060 degC synthesis. However, samples with _x_\leq0.8 displayed a small fraction of excess Sr_{2}GdRuO_{6} (<\sim7% for x = 0.5) with the excess Sr_{2}GdRuO_{6} systematically decreasing with increasing Ce concentration. There were also extra weak peaks for _x_\leq0.8 that could not be indexed to the RuSr_{2}_R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}_I4/mmm space group or other possible impurity phases. We show later that the small Sr_{2}GdRuO_{6} impurity fraction did not effect _T_{c}_ or the magnetization data.

The Raman data were obtained on ceramic-powder samples using the 514.5-nm line of a Ar-ion laser. The incident power was less than 20 mW. The incident light was vertically polarized and the scattered light was unpolarized. However, the polarization sensitivity of the double monochromator and the CCD detector meant that the detected light was predominantly vertically polarized. The resistance data was obtained using the four-terminal technique and the thermopower data was obtained using the standard differential method. The variable-temperature magnetization data were obtained using a vibrating-sample magnetometer for temperatures greater than 15 K and for magnetic fields of up to 10 000 G. One sample was also measured using a SQUID magnetometer.

A part of the RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} sample was annealed at 600 degC in 0.1% {\rm O}_{2} and 99.9 % {\rm N}_{2} gas for 14 h. The decrease in \delta was estimated from the change in mass to be 0.10 and there was no evidence of superconductivity. Another part of the RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} sample was annealed at 100 bars in oxygen for 12 h at 600 degC, ramped to 350 degC over 24 h, and annealed at 350 degC for 72 h. We observed a mass change corresponding to an increase in \delta of 0.07.

## 6 Results and Analysis

The RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} lattice parameters were, within experimental error, independent of Ce concentration. We found that a = (3.840 \pm 0.004) A and c = (28.58 \pm 0.03) A. These values are comparable to those reported by Bauernfeind, Widder, and Braun [_a_ = 3.836 A and c = 28.58 A (Ref. 3)]. It is particularly interesting to note that the _a_-axis lattice parameter is within the range of that observed in RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (Ref. 3)]. In the case of RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} it is assumed that the rotations of the RuO_{6} octahedra are driven by the large Ru-O-Ru bond length when compared with the Cu-O-Cu bond length. Thus, a similar _a_-axis lattice parameter in both RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} and RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} may indicate that RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} also has a rotation of the RuO_{6} octahedra.

We find that, while the structure of RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} contains the electron-doped T^{\prime}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}O_{2} substructure, there is no evidence of the corresponding phonon modes. This is apparent in Fig. 2 where we plot the room-temperature Raman spectra from RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}  596 cm^{-1}. The peaks in the Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} Raman spectra at 347 and 492 cm^{-1} have been attributed to B_{1g} and E_{g} vibrations of O(4), respectively, while the peak at 596 cm^{-1} is assigned as a A_{1g}+ peak, which may be due to O(4) sites in the structures that have been rotated to be directly above Cu.^{20} It can be seen in Fig. 2 that there is an additional broad peak near 400 cm^{-1} in the RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} Raman spectra, however, this peak is not near any of the expected R_{2-x}Ce_{x}O_{2} substructure peaks. The absence of O(4) vibrations in the RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} Raman spectra may be due to disorder from a variable Ce content and a variable oxygen content in the R_{2-x}Ce_{x}O_{2} substructure.

It can be seen in Fig. 3 that both the zero resistance, T_{c}(0), and the initial decrease in the resistance, T_{c}, vary systematically with increasing Ce concentration. This is clearer in the inset to Fig. 3(b) where we plot T_{c}(0) (open circles) and T_{c} (filled circles) against the Ce concentration. We find that T_{c}(0) and T_{c} are maximum for 0.6 Ce being 35 K and 50 K for RuSr_{2}Gd_{1-\delta}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}, respectively. In the case of RuSr_{2}Eu_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}, T_{c}(0) = 26 K and T_{c} = 49 K. The maximum T_{c}(0) and T_{c} values are higher than those reported by Felner _et al._ [\sim20 and 42 K for x = 0.6 and R = Gd (Ref. 1)] and are comparable to those of Bauernfield, Widder, and Braun [38 and 45 K for x = 0.5 and R = Gd (Ref. 3)]. The T_{c} values for RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} are also comparable to those in RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} [T_{c} = 45 K (Refs. 9 and 21)]. However, T_{c} for RuSr_{2}Eu_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} is significantly higher than that in RuSr_{2}Eu_{2}Cu_{2}O_{8} [T_{c} = 32 K (Refs. 16 and 21)]. It is interesting to note that the values of T_{c}(0) and T_{c} in RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} are also significantly higher than those reported in nonmagnetic NbSr_{2}Eu_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (\sim13 and \sim20 K, respectively^{5}). This may suggest that T_{c} is not being significantly affected by the magnetic order in the RuO_{2} layers (e.g., by possible magnetic pairbreaking).

It is apparent in Fig. 3 that the resistance data for all the as-made RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} samples display a semiconductorlike increase for low temperatures. However, in the case of RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}, which has the smallest increase, the semiconductorlike upturn disappears after oxygen loading at 100 bars as can be seen by the dotted curve in Fig. 3(a). The origin of the semiconductorlike upturn in oxygen-deficient samples is not clear. It may be partly due to oxygen depletion at the grain boundaries. We note that Bauernfeind, Widder, and Braun also observed the progressive development of a low-temperature semiconductorlike upturn with increasing oxygen deficiency.^{3}

The resistance transitions are much broader than those observed in many of the other HTSC. For example, the superconducting transition width is about 14 K for the as-made RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} sample. The superconducting transition width is broader than that observed by Bauernfeind, Widder, and Braun^{3} and it is comparable to that observed by Felner _et al.^{1}_ Furthermore, as can be seen in Fig. 3(b), the superconducting transition width is comparable to that observed in RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8}.^{21} Part of the superconducting transition width may be due to oxygen disorder in RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} and structural disorder in RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8}. However, we note that a broad superconducting transition is also expected within the spontaneous vortex phase model.

Unlike some other dopants in HTSC we find that most of the additional electrons introduced by Ce do not appear to be significantly altering the hole concentration on the CuO_{2} planes. This is apparent in the inset to Fig. 3(b) where it can

The resistance data have been vertically scaled to the same value at 220 K. Also shown is the resistance from the RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} sample, which was oxygen loaded at 100 bars [dotted curve, Fig. 4(a)], RuSr_{2}Eu_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} [dashed curve, Fig. 4(a)], and RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} [dashed curve, Fig. 4(b) (Ref. 21)]. Figure 4(b) inset: Plot of T_{c} and T_{c}(0) against Ce content.

  be seen that an increase in x from 0.4 to 0.8 results in a small increase and then decrease in T_{c} . If all of the electrons were doped onto the CuO_{2} planes then the hole concentration n should decrease by 0.2. However, by comparison with other HTSC,[22] a decrease in n by 0.2 should result in large changes in T_{c} . This is apparent by noting that most HTSC have been shown to follow the T_{c}(n) correlation, T_{c}(n) = T_{c,\max}[1 -82.6(n - 0.16)^{2}] where superconductivity occurs for 0.05 \leqslantn = 0.27.[22] Thus if RuSr_{2}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} is underdoped (n < 0.16) then T_{c} should decrease from 43 K for x = 0.4 to 0 for x > 0.6, which is obviously not the case. On the other hand, if we assume that RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} is overdoped, then by comparison with other HTSC, T_{c} should dramatically increase and then decrease. It is possible that, similar to Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Y_{x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta},[23] the additional electrons introduced by Ce^{4+} are partially compensated for by an increase in \delta. For example, an increase in x from 0.4 to 0.8 could be compensated for by an increase in \delta of 0.2. It is also possible that the additional electrons introduced by Ce^{4+} are appearing in the RuO_{2} layers. The possible effects of a change in \delta or a decrease in the Ru valence can be seen using simple valence counting. In the case of RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} it has been shown from a x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) study that the Ru valence is +4.6.[24] Thus, from simple valence counting, this gives a Cu valence of p = + 2.2, which is close to that of underdoped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. From the similar T_{c} values of RuSr_{2}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} and RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} we might expect that the Cu valence is also \sim + 2.2 in RuSr_{2}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}. Thus, using p = 0.5 + \delta + (y - x)/2, where 5 - y is the average Ru valence, assuming that p = + 2.2 and using y = 0 for x = 0.5,[25] we find that \delta = 0.03 for x = 0.5. It is possible that p = + 2.2 is maintained for increasing x by a corresponding increase in \delta.

We show later that there are significant changes in the low-field magnetization data commencing between 70 and 130 K, depending on the Ce concentration. If the RuO_{2} layers contributed significantly to the normal-state conductivity then we might expect the magnetic ordering in the RuO_{2} layers to be mirrored by a decrease in the resistance. This is observed in other ruthenate compounds.[26, 27, 28] For example, there is a decrease in the SrRuO_{3} resistance near the ferromagnetic-ordering temperature (160 K).[26] However, it is clear in Fig. 3 that it is not observed in RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}, even after the 100-bar anneal, and it is also not observed in RuSr_{2}R_{2}Cu_{2}O_{8}.[9, 12, 11] In the case of RuSr_{2}R_{2}Cu_{2}O_{8} the effect of the RuO_{2} layers is observed indirectly by magnetoresistance measurements.[12, 13] It is therefore possible that the RuO_{2} layers in RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} do not contribute directly to the normal-state conductivity (i.e., \sigma_{\rm RuO_{2}}\ll\sigma_{\rm CuO_{2}}).

We show in Fig. 4 that the thermopower also changes with increasing Ce concentration. It can be seen in the inset to Fig. 4(a) that the room-temperature thermopower initially decreases and then increases with increasing Ce concentration (filled circles). It had previously been argued in the case of RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} that the room-temperature thermopower S(300\,{\rm K}) of RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8}(\sim 60 \muV/K) is indicative of a very underdoped high-temperature superconductor (HTSC) [n \sim 0.065 (Ref. 9)]. This was based on the S(300\,{\rm K}) hole-concentration correlation,[29] which has been found for most of the HTSC's. A similar interpretation of S(300\,{\rm K}) for RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} would imply that RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} is a hole-doped HTSC and the maximum hole concentration is \sim0.10 for x = 0.6. However, there is a problem because according to the S(300\,{\rm K}) vs hole-concentration correlation, S(300\,{\rm K}) for RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} should systematically increase with increasing Ce concentration (i.e., decreasing hole concentration). It may be that like La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4},[30] RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} does not follow the S(300\,{\rm K}) vs hole-concentration correlation or the electrons introduced by Ce^{4+} are partially compensated for by an increase in \delta.

The effect of oxygen unloading is to increase S(300\,{\rm K}) while oxygen loading decreases S(300\,{\rm K}) as can be seen in Fig. 4(a) inset for the RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.6}Ce_{0.4}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} sample. The decrease in oxygen content for the oxygen unloaded sample corresponds to a maximum decrease in the hole concentration in the CuO_{2} planes of 0.10. It might be expected that a decrease in \delta of 0.10 is equivalent to a 0.20 increase in the

 Ce content. However, this does not appear to be the case because _S_(300 K) for the oxygen-reduced sample is even higher than that for the 1.0 Ce sample. We show later that changes in the magnetic order correlate with a decrease in d of 0.10 corresponding to an increase in x of 0.20.

The temperature dependence of the thermopower for RuSr_{2}_R_2_{-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} has features similar to those found in RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8}.[21, 3] In particular, _S_(_T_) is flat or initially increases with decreasing temperature. At a lower temperature of \sim170 K, _S_(_T_) begins to decrease for all the samples studied. This is clearer in the inset to Fig. 4(b) where we plot _dS_/_dT_ against temperature for RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (open circles). The normal-state temperature dependence of the derivative is essentially the same for all the superconducting RuSr_{2}_R_2_{-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} samples and is only different for nonsuperconducting RuSr_{2}_R_CeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (open up triangles). Although there is no generally accepted model for the thermopower in the HTSC, we believe that the thermopower is dominated by the CuO_{2} layers. In two of the other HTSC's, which contain CuO_{2} planes and conducting CuO chains or CuO ribbons, it has been shown that the thermopower can be modeled as _S_(_T_) = (_s_CaO_{2}/_s_T_)_S_CuO_{2} + (_s_CuO_{2}/_s_T_)_S_CuO_{2}, where _s_CaO_{2} is the conductivity from the CuO_{2} planes, _s_CaO is the conductivity from the CuO chain or ribbons, _s_CaO_{7} is the total conductivity, _S_CaO_{2} is the thermopower from the CuO_{2} planes, and _S_CaO is the thermopower from the CuO chain or ribbons.[30, 31, 32] Thus, the interpretation of the RuSr_{2}_R_2_{-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} resistance data in terms of _s_RuO_{2}*_s_CaO_{2} can lead to the thermopower being dominated by the CuO_{2} layers.

It is important to note that the decrease in the thermopower below \sim170 K does not imply that the decrease is somehow related to the magnetic order. This is apparent in Fig. 4(b) where we also plot the thermopower from undoped La_{1.87}Sr_{0.13}CuO_{4} (crosses). It can be seen that La_{1.87}Sr_{0.13}CuO_{4} displays general features similar to those seen in RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}, except that the decrease in _S_(_T_) occurs at a lower temperature (\sim130 K). Furthermore, as we show later, the peak in the zero-field-cooled magnetization and the saturation magnetization systematically increase with increasing Ce concentration. However, this is not reflected by changes in the temperature dependence of the thermopower.

The rapid decrease in _S_(_T_) for RuSr_{2}_R_2_{-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} at low temperatures signals the onset of superconductivity. We find that the zero-thermopower temperature (49 K for R = Gd and 41 K for R = Eu for x = 0.6) is close to _T__{c} as determined from the resistance data. Similar behavior is observed in RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8}, where zero thermopower occurs at \sim49 K, the resistance begins to decrease below 45 K, and a specific-heat jump is observed at 45 K.[9, 21]

It is apparent in Fig. 5(a) that there are systematic changes in the low-field zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization M2FC from RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} with increasing Ce concentration. In particular, there is a peak in M2FC at a temperature _T__{p}, which increases in temperature with increasing Ce concentration, and for higher temperatures there is a gradual decrease in M2FC with increasing temperature. Furthermore, this peak disappears with increasing magnetic field as can be seen in Fig. 5(b). Similar features were observed in RuSr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} for x = 0.5 and x = 0.6 where the data was interpreted in terms of localized Ru moment magnetic ordering at 180 K, slight spin canting below \sim170 K, and Ru-Ru and/or Gd-Ru interactions at lower temperatures.[19] However, as we show later, the saturation magnetization data at 9500 G can be interpreted in terms of itinerant ferromagnetism in the RuO_{2} layers. Unfortunately, there are no reports of neutron diffraction or very-high-field magnetization measurements, which would provide a better understanding of the magnetic order in RuSr_{2}_R_2_{-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}. In the absence of such data, we associate _T__{p} with the ferromagnetic ordering in the RuO_{2} layers. We note again that there was no evidence of SrRuO_{3} (magnetic-ordering temperature of 160 K) in the XRD pattern. There was some evidence of Gd_{2}SrRuO_{6} and Eu_{2}SrRuO_{6} but these phases do not magnetically order above 100 K.

We show in the inset to Fig. 5(b) that _T__{p} at 50 G increases systematically with increasing Ce concentration and there is no significant change for R = Gd (filled circles) or R = Eu (filled up triangles). It is not clear if the increase in _T__{p} is due to the additional holes going onto the RuO_{2} layers or structurally induced changes in the RuO_{2} layer band structure. A similar increase in the magnetic-ordering temperature has

Also shown is _T__{p} for the RuSr_{2}Gd_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} sample annealed at 600 Â°C in 0.1%O_{2} (open circle) and at 100 bars (cross).

  been observed in Ca_{1-x}Sr_{x}RuO_{3} with increasing x for x> 0.3.[27, 33] However Ca and Sr have the same 2+ valence and hence the increase in T_{p} with increasing Ca concentration is not due to a simple doping effect. It is interesting to note that the removal of oxygen (i.e., the removal of holes) from RuSr_{2}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} has the same effect on T_{p} as an increase in Ce concentration (i.e., the removal of holes). This can be seen in the inset to Fig. 5(b) where we plot the data for the RuSr_{2}R_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} sample, which had been annealed at 600 degC in 0.1%O_{2} gas resulting in a decrease in \delta by 0.10 (open circle) or an equivalent increase in the Ce content of 0.20. Also shown in the inset to Fig. 5(b) is T_{p} for the RuSr_{2}R_{1.4}Ce_{0.6}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} sample annealed at 100 bars (cross symbol), which results in an increase in the oxygen content of 0.07. It can be seen that T_{p} decreases in a manner consistent with an equivalent decrease in the Ce content of 0.14.

We show in Fig. 6 that both RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} and RuSr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} display similar magnetic hysteresis with increasing applied magnetic field. Here we plot the magnetization against magnetic field for x = 0.8. The larger gradient observed for Gd is due to the large Gd moment. It can be seen that both the remanent magnetization and the coercive field decrease with increasing temperature. The resultant remanent magnetization is plotted in Fig. 7 for fully loaded RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (solid symbols) and RuSr_{2}Eu_{1.2}Ce_{0.8}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (solid curve). We find that the remanent magnetization from RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} falls onto a common curve for 0.6\leqx \leq 1.0 and is still finite for temperatures up to 100 K. Oxygen removal for x = 0.6 has no significant effect on the remanent magnetization as can be seen by the open circles in Fig. 7.

We show in Fig. 8 that the magnetization saturates for moderate magnetic fields (\sim2500 G) after which the magnetization increases slowly with increasing magnetic field. Here we plot the magnetization from RuSr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} [Fig. 8(a)] and RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} [Fig. 8(b)] at 16 K. The linear saturation of the magnetization observed in RuSr_{2}R_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} for magnetic fields above \sim2500 G and at 16 K can be contrasted with RuSr_{2}EuCu_{2}O_{8} [dashed curve in Fig. 8(a) and at 25 K (Ref. [16])], where the magnetization has not saturated for magnetic fields as high as 60 000 G. The magnetization for RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} has a slope that is much greater than that of RuSr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}, which is due to the Gd^{3+} moment. In the case of RuSr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}, the Van Vleck paramagnetism from Eu^{3+} at 16 K is too small to account for the increase in the magnetization above \sim2500 G. To characterize the saturation magnetization with increasing Ce concentration, we plot the magnetization at 9500 G and 16 K from RuSr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} in the inset to Fig. 7 (solid up triangles). Also plotted is the magnetization at 9500 G and 16 K from RuSr_{2}Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (filled circles) after subtraction of the Curie-Weiss term attributed to the Gd^{3+} moment, which is assumed to be 7 \mu_{B}/Gd (Ref. [2]) in RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8}. It can be seen that the saturation magnetization increases consistently for both

There are a number of similarities between the magnetic and electronic behavior of the RuO_{2} layers in SrRuO_{3}, RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8}, and RuSr_{2}F_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta}. For example, the octahedral crystal field results in the 4_d^{4} band splitting to become a triplet (_t_{2g}_) state and a higher-energy doublet (_e_{g}_) valence band. Thus for Ru^{4+}, the ground state should have S = 1 and hence the saturation moment should be 2.0_m_\mu_{B}/Ru. However, in the case of SrRuO_{3} and RuSr_{2}EuCu_{2}O_{8} the saturation moment at 60 kG and 5 K is only ~1.3_m_\mu_{B}/Ru (Ref. [27]) and ~1_m_\mu_{B}/Ru (Ref. [16]), respectively. Interestingly, the moment per Ru in SrRuO_{3} has not saturated for magnetic fields as high as 300 kG [~1.4_m_\mu_{B}/Ru at 300 kG and 50 K (Ref. [27])]. In the case of SrRuO_{3} it is now believed that SrRuO_{3} is an itinerant ferromagnetic metal as well as a "bad" metal with a very small mean free path.[26, 27, 33] It is therefore possible that the RuO_{2} layers in both RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8} and RuSr_{2}F_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} display itinerant magnetic behavior. This interpretation is different from that suggested by a recent XANES study on RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8} where the data was interpreted in terms of a mixture of Ru^{4+} and Ru^{5+} ferrimagnetism and it was suggested that there is a double-exchange interaction in the RuO_{2} layers.[24] The double-exchange mechanism[34] has been invoked to explain the ferromagnetic transition in La_{1-x}Sr_{x}MnO_{3}, where the ordering is accompanied by a dramatic decrease in the resistivity.[35] For the double-exchange mechanism to be valid in RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8} and RuSr_{2}_R_2_{-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} we would expect a mixture of t_{2g}^{3}e^{1}(Ru^{4+}) and t_{2g}^{3}(Ru^{5+}) with S = 2 and S = 3/2, respectively. Therefore, we might expect the saturation magnetization to be between 4_m_\mu_{B}/Ru and 3_m_\mu_{B}/Ru. However, as mentioned above, the saturation magnetization at 9500 G and 16 K for RuSr_{2}F_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} is less than 1_m_\mu_{B}/Ru. Furthermore, the saturation magnetization at 60 000 G and 5 K for RuSr_{2}EuCu_{2}O_{8} is only ~1_m_\mu_{B}/Ru.

The itinerant ferromagnetic interpretation for RuSr_{2}_R_2_{-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} conveniently explains why the saturation magnetization is less than that expected within a local moment model and why the saturation magnetization varies systematically with increasing Ce concentration. A similar increase in both the saturation magnetization and the magnetic-ordering temperature is observed in Ca_{1-x}Sr_{x}RuO_{2} for x > 0.3 where, as mentioned earlier, the substitution of Sr^{2+} for Ca^{2+} is not expected to result in a simple doping effect. The changes observed in Ca_{1-x}Sr_{x}RuO_{3} have been interpreted in terms of band effects where the underlying interaction is assumed to be ferromagnetic.[26, 27, 33] The low-field antiferromagnetic order of RuSr_{2}R_Cu_{2}O_{8} and the spin-flip transition for higher applied fields indicates that the interactions are more complex in RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8}. Antiferromagnetic order is observed in another ruthenate, Sr_{2}GdRuO_{6}, but this ruthenate is also an insulator.

## Conclusion

We have shown that the RuSr_{2}_R_2_{-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} transport data can be interpreted in terms of the CuO_{2} layers dominating the electrical conductivity and the thermopower. There is possibly exchange coupling from the carriers in the RuO_{2} layers to the conduction-band carriers in the CuO_{2} layers, as is observed in RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8}. There is a low-field peak in the zero-field-cooled magnetization and the saturation magnetization increases with increasing Ce concentration. However, there is no direct correlation between these increases and the superconducting transition temperature, which may indicate that pairbreaking via coupling to the RuO_{2} layers is weak. Although the temperature dependence of the magnetization is complex we show, by comparing the saturation magnetization with that from other ruthenate compounds, that the magnetic order in the RuO_{2} layers can be interpreted in terms of itinerant ferromagnetism. The room-temperature Raman spectra display the same modes found in RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8} and there is no evidence of O(4) Raman modes that are observed in the electron-doped _T_'HTSC. This may be due to O(4) site disorder in the R2_{-x}Ce_{x}O_{2} layers, which could arise from a variable oxygen content in the R2_{-x}Ce_{x}O_{2} layers.
