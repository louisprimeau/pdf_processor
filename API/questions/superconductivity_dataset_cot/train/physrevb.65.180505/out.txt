###### Abstract

The bulk upper critical field H_{c2}(T) of superconducting MgB_{2} and its anisotropy are established by analyzing experimental data on the temperature and magnetic-field dependences of the ab-plane thermal conductivity of a single-crystalline sample in external magnetic fields oriented both parallel (H_{c2}) and perpendicular (H_{c2}^{ab}) to the c axis of the hexagonal lattice. From numerical fits we deduce the anisotropy ratio \gamma_{0} = H_{c2}^{ab}(0)/H_{c2}^{c}(0) = 4.2 at T = 0 K. Both the values and the temperature dependences of H_{c2}^{c} and H_{c2}^{ab} are distinctly different from previous claims based on measurements of the electrical resistivity.

Since the recent discovery of superconductivity in MgB_{2} at a critical temperature T_{c} = 40 K,[1] a large number of experimental results on different properties of this compound have been reported in the literature. Most experiments were made using powder or polycrystalline samples. The hexagonal crystal structure of MgB_{2}, however, is expected to cause pronounced anisotropies in the electrical and magnetic properties, which can unambiguously be probed only by experiments using single crystals. In particular, the upper critical field H_{c2}(T) is an important parameter for characterizing the superconducting state of type-II superconductors.[2, 3, 4] For anisotropic materials, such as hexagonal MgB_{2}, the values of H_{c2} may vary considerably for different orientations of the external magnetic field H. Choosing the field directions either perpendicular or parallel to the c axis, the anisotropy may be expressed by a parameter \gamma = H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^{c} , which, in the most general case, may be temperature dependent. Earlier experimental results, mainly based on measurements of the electrical resistivity \rho(T,H), have resulted in a broad range of values of \gamma and of extrapolated zero-temperature values of H_{c2}^{c}(0) and H_{c2}^{ab}(0) (for a review, see Ref. [5]). Most of these experiments, also on single crystals,[6, 7, 8] indicate a positive curvature of H_{c2}(T) in a wide range of temperature below T_{c} and correspondingly, rather high critical fields at T = 0. Attempts to explain these features have led to theoretical work suggesting the existence of some soft bosonic modes[2] and even unconventional mechanisms of superconductivity have been considered.[9]

In this paper we present an evaluation of H_{c2}^{c}(T) and H_{c2}^{ab}(T) of single-crystalline MgB_{2}, based on measurements of the thermal conductivity \kappa(H,T). Complementary results of \rho(T,H), obtained on the same single-crystalline sample, indicate that electrical transport measurements are not well suited to probe the bulk upper critical field H_{c2}(T) of MgB_{2}. Inspecting the temperature dependences of both H_{c2}^{c}(T) and H_{c2}^{ab}(T) close to T_{c} , our results indicate that even the zero-field critical temperature T_{c}(0) of the bulk may be lower than commonly believed up to now. This indicates that, in relation to superconductivity of MgB_{2}, surface effects must be considered.

The thermal conductivity was measured in the basal plane of hexagonal MgB_{2} exposed to varying magnetic fields H, oriented parallel and perpendicular to the basal ab plane with small misalignments of 3.5 \pm 0.5^{\circ} between the field directions and the orientation of the plane. A standard uniaxial heat-flow method, as described in Ref. [10], was used for the \kappa(H,T) measurements. The temperature difference between the two thermometers was about 1% of the absolute average temperature. The measurements of the electrical resistivity \rho(H,T) were made using a four-contact scheme and a dc current of density 50 A/cm^{2} in the ab plane with H along the c direction. The investigated single crystal has lateral dimensions of 0.5 \times 0.17 \times 0.035 mm^{3} and was grown employing a high-pressure cubic anvil technique as described elsewhere.[11]

Low-temperature \rho(T) curves measured in constant external magnetic fields H are presented in Fig. 1 for T<50 K. The zero-field resistive superconducting transition at T_{c} = 38.1 K is rather narrow (\Delta T_{c}\sim 0.15 K), but the application of magnetic fields broadens the transition considerably. If the field dependence of the onset of the resistive transition, as illustrated in Fig. 1 for H = 50 kOe, is plotted in an [H,T] diagram, the curve denoted as H_{\rho}^{c} in Fig. 4 is obtained. These H_{\rho}^{c} data are qualitatively and quantitatively very similar to results previously obtained on single crystals.[6, 7, 8] in particular, with respect to the positive curvature of H_{\rho}^{c}(T). In these earlier works H_{\rho}^{c}(T) was associated with H_{c2}^{c}(T).

Figure 1: The low-temperature electrical resistivity of MgB_{2} and its magnetic-field dependence for a current in the ab plane. The broken lines for H = 50 kOe indicate how the onset of the resistive transition defining H_{\rho}^{c} has been established.

 The H dependence of the thermal conductivity was measured at selected constant temperatures in the range between 2 and 50 K and in fields up to 60 kOe. Representative \kappa(H) curves at selected temperatures are displayed in Figs. 2 and 3 for H\|c and H\|ab, respectively. As demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 2, a hysteretic behavior of \kappa(H), caused by vortex pinning, is observed in the low-field regime for H\|c. In order to avoid ambiguities, each new field setting at a constant temperature was achieved by heating the sample to the normal state above 50 K, and subsequently cooling it to the set temperature in the chosen field. In this way, a smooth variation of \kappa(H), as demonstrated by the open circles in the inset of Fig. 2, was obtained. The field values H_{\rm irr}^{\kappa}, below which the irreversibility is discernible, are rather low. For T = 4.03 K, e.g., H_{\rm irr}^{\kappa}\sim 0.7 kOe. At elevated temperatures and for H\|ab the irreversibilities are reduced, as demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 3.

The curves presented in Figs. 2 and 3 reveal the general features observed at all temperatures below 38.1 K. Starting at H = 0, \kappa drops with a steep slope and, after passing through a minimum, increases again until a region of very weak field dependence above some critical field, denoted as H_{\kappa} is reached. It is remarkable that, for each temperature, H_{\kappa}^{\kappa} is distinctly lower than H_{\rho}^{c} and that no distinct feature of \kappa(H) is observed in the region of H_{\rho}^{c}. This is explicitly demonstrated in Fig. 2. With increasing temperature, H_{\kappa} decreases towards zero as T approaches T_{c} . This general \kappa(H) feature is typical of type-II superconductors and can be explained as follows.[12] The thermal conductivity of a superconductor is due to itinerant electrons (\kappa_{e}) and phonons (\kappa_{\rm ph}). Enhancing H from zero eventually causes the formation of vortices in the bulk of a type-II superconductor. After zero-field cooling, the first vortices form at the lower critical field H_{c1}. Consequently, some additional scattering of phonons by normal electrons in the cores of the vortices will reduce \kappa_{\rm ph}. With further increase in the field the decrease of \kappa_{\rm ph} is compensated by an enhancement of \kappa_{e} . Above H_{c2}, in the normal state, the field dependence of both \kappa_{\rm ph} and \kappa_{e} is expected to be weak. The overall behavior of the \kappa(H) curves shown in Figs. 2 and 3 reflects these expectations, and as may be seen, \kappa(H) is virtually field independent for H>H_{\kappa}.

A more complete analysis of the \kappa(H) data will be presented in a forthcoming paper.[13] Here, we concentrate on the opportunity that these data allow for a reliable evaluation of the bulk upper critical field H_{c2}(T), which obviously coincides with H_{\kappa}(T) as derived from our \kappa(H) curves for both field orientations. It may be seen that H_{c2}^{c}(T) = H_{\kappa}^{c}(T) is distinctly different from H_{\rho}^{c}(T). The solid line in Fig. 4, representing a general prediction for H_{c2}(T) of a conventional type-II superconductor in the case where the coherence length \xi and the electron mean free path l are of similar magnitude,[14] is in fair agreement with the measured H_{c2}^{c}(T). It is obvious that H_{\rho}^{c}(T) does not follow the same general T dependence. Since thermal conductivity experiments probe the bulk of the sample, it is H_{\kappa}^{c}(T) rather than H_{\rho}^{c}(T) that ought to be identified as the upper critical field H_{c2}^{c}(T). Re

The solid vertical arrows mark H_{\kappa}^{ab} , set equal to the upper critical field H_{\kappa}^{c0}. The inset demonstrates the small hysteresis of \kappa(H) at low fields for T = 28.2 K.

The solid vertical arrows mark H_{\kappa}^{c} , set equal to the upper critical field H_{c2}^{c}. The dotted vertical arrow denotes H_{\rho}^{c} (see Fig. 1). The inset demonstrates the irreversible behavior of \kappa(H) below H_{\rm irr}^{\kappa} for T = 4.03 K.

  cent magnetization measurements [15] on single crystals of MgB_{2} using a torque magnetometer result in values and a temperature dependence of H_{c2}^{c}(T) consistent with our H_{\kappa}^{c}(T) and thus support our conclusion. Employing the equation given by anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory H_{c2}(\theta)\!=\![(\sin\theta H_{c2}^{c})^{2}\!+\!(\cos\theta H_{c2}^{ab})^{2} )^{-1/2}, where \theta is the angle between the magnetic field and the ab plane, [16] we estimate the errors in calculating H_{c2} caused by the above-mentioned misalignment of 3.5\pm 0.5^{\circ} to be about 3 \pm 1% for H_{c2}^{ab} and below 0.2% for H_{c2}^{c}.

As displayed in Fig. 4, at temperatures above about 27 K, H_{c2}^{c} varies linearly with temperature with a slope dH_{c2}^{c}\!/\!dT = - 1.17 kOe/K. This behavior leads to an extrapolated zero-field T_{c}^{\prime}\!=\!36.6 K, 1.5 K below T_{c} obtained from \rho(T,0). Using the equations that are given by the Ginzburg-Landau theory considering anisotropies, [16]\xi_{ab}(T)\!=\![\Phi_{0}/2\pi H_{c2}^{c}(T)]^{1/2} and \xi_{ab}(T)\!=\!0.74(1-T/T_{c})^{-1/2}\xi_{ab,0}, where \xi_{ab} is the coherence length in the basal ab plane, we obtain the zero-temperature value of \xi_{ab,0}\!=\!11.8 nm.

Turning to the temperature dependence of the critical field H_{c2}^{ab}(T) for H_{c1}\!\,c, we again note a sizable temperature interval where H_{c2}^{ab}(T) varies linearly with T. This is emphasized by the dotted line in Fig. 4. The slope dH_{c2}^{ab}/dT\!=\!-5.15 kOe/K gives \langle\overline{\xi_{ab,0}}\xi_{c,0}\!\rangle\!=\!5.75 nm and therefore, the zero-temperature value of the c-axis correlation length \xi_{c,0} = 2.8 nm. Another important parameter that can be estimated from our \kappa(H) data is the lower critical field H_{c1}^{ab}, as demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 3. In the temperature region between 28 and 35 K, where an evaluation of H_{c1}^{ab} with reasonable accuracy of about \pm 10% was possible, H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c1}^{ab}\approx 130. From this ratio, using the equation H_{c2}/H_{c1} = 2\kappa_{\rm GL}^{2}/\ln\kappa_{\rm GL}, [16] the parameter \kappa_{\rm GL}^{ab} of the Ginzburg-Landau theory is estimated to be about 13.

As may be seen in Fig. 4, above approximately 33 K, H_{c2}^{ab}(T) deviates from the linear in T variation and, with increasing temperature, approaches zero also at T_{c}^{\prime} defined above. This is reflected in the temperature dependence of the anisotropy ratio \gamma, which seems to decrease with T approaching T_{c}^{\prime}. The positive curvature of H_{c2}(T) is typical of strongly anisotropic, layered superconductors [17] and has often been explained in terms of the Lawrence-Doniach model, [18] which treats a layered superconductor as a stacked array of weakly coupled two-dimensional superconducting sheets. Various other theoretical models have been proposed to explain this feature (for a critical review see, e.g., Ref. [19]). At this point we cannot commit ourselves to any of these models. It is important, however, that the anomaly is absent for H\|c and small and restricted to a rather narrow temperature region for H\bot c. At lower temperatures, with decreasing temperature the anisotropy ratio \gamma(T) tends to a constant value and is approaching \gamma_{0}\!=\!H_{c2}^{ab}(0)/H_{c2}^{c}(0)\!=\!\xi_{ab,0}/\xi_{c,0}\!=\!4.2.

The extrapolation to zero temperature gives H_{c2}^{c}(0)\!\approx\!31 kOe, a considerably lower value than is typically claimed for MgB_{2}. [5] Exceptions are the reports of Refs. [20] and [21]. The rather low value of H_{c2}^{c}(0) and the observation of a Helfand-Werthamer-type [14] temperature dependence of H_{c2}^{c}(T) have important consequences for possible models of the superconducting state of MgB_{2}.

Our result obviously questions the intrinsic nature of H_{c2}(T) derived from measurements of \rho(T). Since the resistive transition is not manifest in \kappa(T), which may be considered as a bulk property, H_{\rho}(T) must correspond to a minor fraction of an additional phase (or phases) with enhanced H_{c2} and T_{c}. The spatial extension of this phase is, however, large enough to short circuit the electrical current path and produce a narrow superconducting transition at a temperature T_{c} higher than the bulk transition temperature T_{c}^{\prime}. Based on an analysis of their magnetization and ac susceptibility data on polycrystalline samples, the authors of Ref. [22] came to a similar conclusion. The most likely origin of the second phase with enhanced superconducting parameters seems to be related to surface effects. A considerable enhancement of the electron density of states near the Fermi level and, therefore, an enhanced trend to superconductivity at the surface of MgB_{2} have been predicted, [23, 24, 25] in agreement with our observations.

In conclusion, we observe a striking disagreement in the values and the temperature dependences of the upper critical field H_{c2}^{c} of MgB_{2} evaluated from results of electrical- and thermal-conductivity measurements on the same sample. The shape of H_{c2}^{c}(T) as established by \kappa(H) with H\|c does not reveal an anomalous positive curvature near T_{c} and therefore no exotic mechanism needs to be involved to explain the upper critical field, at least not for the bulk. Our data also indicate that the bulk transition temperature T_{c}^{\prime} is lower than T_{c} obtained from results of \rho(T) measurements.

###### Abstract

The bulk upper critical field H_{c2}(T) of superconducting MgB_{2} and its anisotropy are established by analyzing experimental data on the temperature and magnetic-field dependences of the ab-plane thermal conductivity of a single-crystalline sample in external magnetic fields oriented both parallel (H_{c2}) and perpendicular (H_{c2}^{ab}) to the c axis of the hexagonal lattice. From numerical fits we deduce the anisotropy ratio \gamma_{0} = H_{c2}^{ab}(0)/H_{c2}^{c}(0) = 4.2 at T = 0 K. Both the values and the temperature dependences of H_{c2}^{c} and H_{c2}^{ab} are distinctly different from previous claims based on measurements of the electrical resistivity.

Since the recent discovery of superconductivity in MgB_{2} at a critical temperature T_{c} = 40 K,[1] a large number of experimental results on different properties of this compound have been reported in the literature. Most experiments were made using powder or polycrystalline samples. The hexagonal crystal structure of MgB_{2}, however, is expected to cause pronounced anisotropies in the electrical and magnetic properties, which can unambiguously be probed only by experiments using single crystals. In particular, the upper critical field H_{c2}(T) is an important parameter for characterizing the superconducting state of type-II superconductors.[2, 3, 4] For anisotropic materials, such as hexagonal MgB_{2}, the values of H_{c2} may vary considerably for different orientations of the external magnetic field H. Choosing the field directions either perpendicular or parallel to the c axis, the anisotropy may be expressed by a parameter \gamma = H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^{c} , which, in the most general case, may be temperature dependent. Earlier experimental results, mainly based on measurements of the electrical resistivity \rho(T,H), have resulted in a broad range of values of \gamma and of extrapolated zero-temperature values of H_{c2}^{c}(0) and H_{c2}^{ab}(0) (for a review, see Ref. [5]). Most of these experiments, also on single crystals,[6, 7, 8] indicate a positive curvature of H_{c2}(T) in a wide range of temperature below T_{c} and correspondingly, rather high critical fields at T = 0. Attempts to explain these features have led to theoretical work suggesting the existence of some soft bosonic modes[2] and even unconventional mechanisms of superconductivity have been considered.[9]

In this paper we present an evaluation of H_{c2}^{c}(T) and H_{c2}^{ab}(T) of single-crystalline MgB_{2}, based on measurements of the thermal conductivity \kappa(H,T). Complementary results of \rho(T,H), obtained on the same single-crystalline sample, indicate that electrical transport measurements are not well suited to probe the bulk upper critical field H_{c2}(T) of MgB_{2}. Inspecting the temperature dependences of both H_{c2}^{c}(T) and H_{c2}^{ab}(T) close to T_{c} , our results indicate that even the zero-field critical temperature T_{c}(0) of the bulk may be lower than commonly believed up to now. This indicates that, in relation to superconductivity of MgB_{2}, surface effects must be considered.

The thermal conductivity was measured in the basal plane of hexagonal MgB_{2} exposed to varying magnetic fields H, oriented parallel and perpendicular to the basal ab plane with small misalignments of 3.5 \pm 0.5^{\circ} between the field directions and the orientation of the plane. A standard uniaxial heat-flow method, as described in Ref. [10], was used for the \kappa(H,T) measurements. The temperature difference between the two thermometers was about 1% of the absolute average temperature. The measurements of the electrical resistivity \rho(H,T) were made using a four-contact scheme and a dc current of density 50 A/cm^{2} in the ab plane with H along the c direction. The investigated single crystal has lateral dimensions of 0.5 \times 0.17 \times 0.035 mm^{3} and was grown employing a high-pressure cubic anvil technique as described elsewhere.[11]

Low-temperature \rho(T) curves measured in constant external magnetic fields H are presented in Fig. 1 for T<50 K. The zero-field resistive superconducting transition at T_{c} = 38.1 K is rather narrow (\Delta T_{c}\sim 0.15 K), but the application of magnetic fields broadens the transition considerably. If the field dependence of the onset of the resistive transition, as illustrated in Fig. 1 for H = 50 kOe, is plotted in an [H,T] diagram, the curve denoted as H_{\rho}^{c} in Fig. 4 is obtained. These H_{\rho}^{c} data are qualitatively and quantitatively very similar to results previously obtained on single crystals.[6, 7, 8] in particular, with respect to the positive curvature of H_{\rho}^{c}(T). In these earlier works H_{\rho}^{c}(T) was associated with H_{c2}^{c}(T).

Figure 1: The low-temperature electrical resistivity of MgB_{2} and its magnetic-field dependence for a current in the ab plane. The broken lines for H = 50 kOe indicate how the onset of the resistive transition defining H_{\rho}^{c} has been established.

 The H dependence of the thermal conductivity was measured at selected constant temperatures in the range between 2 and 50 K and in fields up to 60 kOe. Representative \kappa(H) curves at selected temperatures are displayed in Figs. 2 and 3 for H\|c and H\|ab, respectively. As demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 2, a hysteretic behavior of \kappa(H), caused by vortex pinning, is observed in the low-field regime for H\|c. In order to avoid ambiguities, each new field setting at a constant temperature was achieved by heating the sample to the normal state above 50 K, and subsequently cooling it to the set temperature in the chosen field. In this way, a smooth variation of \kappa(H), as demonstrated by the open circles in the inset of Fig. 2, was obtained. The field values H_{\rm irr}^{\kappa}, below which the irreversibility is discernible, are rather low. For T = 4.03 K, e.g., H_{\rm irr}^{\kappa}\sim 0.7 kOe. At elevated temperatures and for H\|ab the irreversibilities are reduced, as demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 3.

The curves presented in Figs. 2 and 3 reveal the general features observed at all temperatures below 38.1 K. Starting at H = 0, \kappa drops with a steep slope and, after passing through a minimum, increases again until a region of very weak field dependence above some critical field, denoted as H_{\kappa} is reached. It is remarkable that, for each temperature, H_{\kappa}^{\kappa} is distinctly lower than H_{\rho}^{c} and that no distinct feature of \kappa(H) is observed in the region of H_{\rho}^{c}. This is explicitly demonstrated in Fig. 2. With increasing temperature, H_{\kappa} decreases towards zero as T approaches T_{c} . This general \kappa(H) feature is typical of type-II superconductors and can be explained as follows.[12] The thermal conductivity of a superconductor is due to itinerant electrons (\kappa_{e}) and phonons (\kappa_{\rm ph}). Enhancing H from zero eventually causes the formation of vortices in the bulk of a type-II superconductor. After zero-field cooling, the first vortices form at the lower critical field H_{c1}. Consequently, some additional scattering of phonons by normal electrons in the cores of the vortices will reduce \kappa_{\rm ph}. With further increase in the field the decrease of \kappa_{\rm ph} is compensated by an enhancement of \kappa_{e} . Above H_{c2}, in the normal state, the field dependence of both \kappa_{\rm ph} and \kappa_{e} is expected to be weak. The overall behavior of the \kappa(H) curves shown in Figs. 2 and 3 reflects these expectations, and as may be seen, \kappa(H) is virtually field independent for H>H_{\kappa}.

A more complete analysis of the \kappa(H) data will be presented in a forthcoming paper.[13] Here, we concentrate on the opportunity that these data allow for a reliable evaluation of the bulk upper critical field H_{c2}(T), which obviously coincides with H_{\kappa}(T) as derived from our \kappa(H) curves for both field orientations. It may be seen that H_{c2}^{c}(T) = H_{\kappa}^{c}(T) is distinctly different from H_{\rho}^{c}(T). The solid line in Fig. 4, representing a general prediction for H_{c2}(T) of a conventional type-II superconductor in the case where the coherence length \xi and the electron mean free path l are of similar magnitude,[14] is in fair agreement with the measured H_{c2}^{c}(T). It is obvious that H_{\rho}^{c}(T) does not follow the same general T dependence. Since thermal conductivity experiments probe the bulk of the sample, it is H_{\kappa}^{c}(T) rather than H_{\rho}^{c}(T) that ought to be identified as the upper critical field H_{c2}^{c}(T). Re

The solid vertical arrows mark H_{\kappa}^{ab} , set equal to the upper critical field H_{\kappa}^{c0}. The inset demonstrates the small hysteresis of \kappa(H) at low fields for T = 28.2 K.

The solid vertical arrows mark H_{\kappa}^{c} , set equal to the upper critical field H_{c2}^{c}. The dotted vertical arrow denotes H_{\rho}^{c} (see Fig. 1). The inset demonstrates the irreversible behavior of \kappa(H) below H_{\rm irr}^{\kappa} for T = 4.03 K.

  cent magnetization measurements [15] on single crystals of MgB_{2} using a torque magnetometer result in values and a temperature dependence of H_{c2}^{c}(T) consistent with our H_{\kappa}^{c}(T) and thus support our conclusion. Employing the equation given by anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory H_{c2}(\theta)\!=\![(\sin\theta H_{c2}^{c})^{2}\!+\!(\cos\theta H_{c2}^{ab})^{2} )^{-1/2}, where \theta is the angle between the magnetic field and the ab plane, [16] we estimate the errors in calculating H_{c2} caused by the above-mentioned misalignment of 3.5\pm 0.5^{\circ} to be about 3 \pm 1% for H_{c2}^{ab} and below 0.2% for H_{c2}^{c}.

As displayed in Fig. 4, at temperatures above about 27 K, H_{c2}^{c} varies linearly with temperature with a slope dH_{c2}^{c}\!/\!dT = - 1.17 kOe/K. This behavior leads to an extrapolated zero-field T_{c}^{\prime}\!=\!36.6 K, 1.5 K below T_{c} obtained from \rho(T,0). Using the equations that are given by the Ginzburg-Landau theory considering anisotropies, [16]\xi_{ab}(T)\!=\![\Phi_{0}/2\pi H_{c2}^{c}(T)]^{1/2} and \xi_{ab}(T)\!=\!0.74(1-T/T_{c})^{-1/2}\xi_{ab,0}, where \xi_{ab} is the coherence length in the basal ab plane, we obtain the zero-temperature value of \xi_{ab,0}\!=\!11.8 nm.

Turning to the temperature dependence of the critical field H_{c2}^{ab}(T) for H_{c1}\!\,c, we again note a sizable temperature interval where H_{c2}^{ab}(T) varies linearly with T. This is emphasized by the dotted line in Fig. 4. The slope dH_{c2}^{ab}/dT\!=\!-5.15 kOe/K gives \langle\overline{\xi_{ab,0}}\xi_{c,0}\!\rangle\!=\!5.75 nm and therefore, the zero-temperature value of the c-axis correlation length \xi_{c,0} = 2.8 nm. Another important parameter that can be estimated from our \kappa(H) data is the lower critical field H_{c1}^{ab}, as demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 3. In the temperature region between 28 and 35 K, where an evaluation of H_{c1}^{ab} with reasonable accuracy of about \pm 10% was possible, H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c1}^{ab}\approx 130. From this ratio, using the equation H_{c2}/H_{c1} = 2\kappa_{\rm GL}^{2}/\ln\kappa_{\rm GL}, [16] the parameter \kappa_{\rm GL}^{ab} of the Ginzburg-Landau theory is estimated to be about 13.

As may be seen in Fig. 4, above approximately 33 K, H_{c2}^{ab}(T) deviates from the linear in T variation and, with increasing temperature, approaches zero also at T_{c}^{\prime} defined above. This is reflected in the temperature dependence of the anisotropy ratio \gamma, which seems to decrease with T approaching T_{c}^{\prime}. The positive curvature of H_{c2}(T) is typical of strongly anisotropic, layered superconductors [17] and has often been explained in terms of the Lawrence-Doniach model, [18] which treats a layered superconductor as a stacked array of weakly coupled two-dimensional superconducting sheets. Various other theoretical models have been proposed to explain this feature (for a critical review see, e.g., Ref. [19]). At this point we cannot commit ourselves to any of these models. It is important, however, that the anomaly is absent for H\|c and small and restricted to a rather narrow temperature region for H\bot c. At lower temperatures, with decreasing temperature the anisotropy ratio \gamma(T) tends to a constant value and is approaching \gamma_{0}\!=\!H_{c2}^{ab}(0)/H_{c2}^{c}(0)\!=\!\xi_{ab,0}/\xi_{c,0}\!=\!4.2.

The extrapolation to zero temperature gives H_{c2}^{c}(0)\!\approx\!31 kOe, a considerably lower value than is typically claimed for MgB_{2}. [5] Exceptions are the reports of Refs. [20] and [21]. The rather low value of H_{c2}^{c}(0) and the observation of a Helfand-Werthamer-type [14] temperature dependence of H_{c2}^{c}(T) have important consequences for possible models of the superconducting state of MgB_{2}.

Our result obviously questions the intrinsic nature of H_{c2}(T) derived from measurements of \rho(T). Since the resistive transition is not manifest in \kappa(T), which may be considered as a bulk property, H_{\rho}(T) must correspond to a minor fraction of an additional phase (or phases) with enhanced H_{c2} and T_{c}. The spatial extension of this phase is, however, large enough to short circuit the electrical current path and produce a narrow superconducting transition at a temperature T_{c} higher than the bulk transition temperature T_{c}^{\prime}. Based on an analysis of their magnetization and ac susceptibility data on polycrystalline samples, the authors of Ref. [22] came to a similar conclusion. The most likely origin of the second phase with enhanced superconducting parameters seems to be related to surface effects. A considerable enhancement of the electron density of states near the Fermi level and, therefore, an enhanced trend to superconductivity at the surface of MgB_{2} have been predicted, [23, 24, 25] in agreement with our observations.

In conclusion, we observe a striking disagreement in the values and the temperature dependences of the upper critical field H_{c2}^{c} of MgB_{2} evaluated from results of electrical- and thermal-conductivity measurements on the same sample. The shape of H_{c2}^{c}(T) as established by \kappa(H) with H\|c does not reveal an anomalous positive curvature near T_{c} and therefore no exotic mechanism needs to be involved to explain the upper critical field, at least not for the bulk. Our data also indicate that the bulk transition temperature T_{c}^{\prime} is lower than T_{c} obtained from results of \rho(T) measurements.
