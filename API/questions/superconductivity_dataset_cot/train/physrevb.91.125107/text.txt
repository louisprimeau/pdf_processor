###### Abstract

We report on \({}^{71}\)Li and \({}^{77}\)Se nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements in the newly discovered iron-based superconductor (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OHFeSe. Both remarkable change in spectrum and divergence of spin-spin relaxation (T\({}_{2}\)) are observed with decreasing temperature, suggesting a static magnetic ordering in this material. Moreover, the broadened \({}^{71}\)Li spectrum also shows a characteristic three-peak structure. Comparison of linewidth between \({}^{71}\)Li and \({}^{77}\)Se spectra indicates that there is a ferromagnetic component along the external field direction and it happens on Fe sites in the (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OH layer rather than the FeSe layer, which is also responsible for the three-peak structure of the \({}^{71}\)Li spectrum with (Li0.8 Fe0.2) random occupation. The field-dependent spectrum and T\({}_{2}\) suggest that the above ferromagnetic component is induced by external magnetic field. Our present results indicate that the superconductivity in (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OHFeSe is very robust against the observed field-induced ferromagnetism and both of them could coexist under external magnetic field.

Since the discovery of high-T\({}_{c}\) superconductivity in layered iron-based superconductors [1, 2, 3, 4], many iron pnictide and selenide superconductors have been found and attracted wide attention [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. All of them share a common Fe\(X\) (\(X\) = As and Se) layered structure unit. FeSe possesses the so-called "11" structure which is the simplest structure among the iron-based superconductors. Although the T\({}_{c}\) of bulk FeSe is only 8.0 K [7], one-unit-cell FeSe thin film on SrTiO\({}_{3}\) substrate could achieve the highest superconducting transition temperature (T\({}_{c}\)) in iron-based superconductors with \(T_{c}\)\(\sim\) 65 K [6, 10, 11]. In recent years, many high-T\({}_{c}\) FeSe-derived superconductors have also been found, such as \(A_{x}\) Fe2-\({}_{x}\) Se\({}_{2}\) (\(A\) = K, Rb, Cs) and Li\({}_{x}\)(NH2)\({}_{x}\)(NH3)\({}_{1-y}\) Fe2 Se2 [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. However, FeSe-derived superconductors are still very rare compared to FeAs-based superconductors. Very recently, Lu _et al._ reported a new type of FeSe-derived superconductor (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OHFeSe with \(T_{c}\)\(\sim\) 43 K [18, 19]. This offers a new material platform to study the underlying mechanism of superconductivity in FeSe-derived superconductors. Besides discovering superconductivity, bulk magnetization and specific heat measurements also indicate a possible magnetic order in (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OHFeSe below \(T_{m}\)\(\sim\) 8.5 K [19]. Moreover, the recent first-principles calculation suggests that a novel block-checkerboard antiferromagnetism (AFM) state instead of collinear stripe AFM state may be a universal ground state for FeSe-derived superconductors, including (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OHFeSe [20]. How to understand the origin of magnetism in (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OHFeSe becomes a central issue.

In this paper, we perform \({}^{71}\)Li (92.5% abundance, \(I\) = 3/2) and \({}^{77}\)Se (7.5% abundance, \(I\) = 1/2) NMR experiments on polycrystalline Li0.8 Fe0.2OHFeSe samples. Both remarkable change in spectrum and divergence of spin-spin relaxation (T\({}_{2}\)) are observed with decreasing temperature, suggesting a static magnetic ordering in this material. Moreover, such magnetism is confirmed to originate from the (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OH layer rather than the FeSe layer. Furthermore, a field-induced ferromagnetic behavior is also observed in present NMR experiments.

A polycrystalline sample of Li0.8 Fe0.2OHFeSe is synthesized by the hydrothermal reaction method with \(T_{c}\)\(\sim\) 34 K [18].The polycrystalline sample is ground and pressed into pellets to perform NMR measurement. All NMR measurements are carried out by using a commercial phase-coherent pulsed spectrometer from Thamway Company Ltd. \({}^{71}\)Li and \({}^{77}\)Se NMR spectra are obtained by integrating the spin echo intensity by sweeping NMR frequency at a fixed magnetic field of 10 T and 11 T, respectively. The spin-spin relaxation T\({}_{2}\) is obtained by fitting the spin echo intensity with \(I(\tau)=I(0)\exp(-2\tau/T_{2})\), where \(\tau\) is the time separation between \(\pi/2\) and \(\pi\) pulses. The magnetization measurements are carried out by commercial SQUID-MPMS.

First, we determine T\({}_{c}\) under external magnetic field by measuring the temperature-dependent characteristic frequency of the circuit in an NMR probe. The initial frequency f0 is tuned to 165.5 MHz. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the temperature-dependent characteristic frequency shows a clear transition below \(T_{c}\) owing to superconductivity. The \(\Delta f\) is obtained by subtracting nonsuperconducting background. In this way, we could obtain the \(H\)-T\({}_{c}\) phase diagram based on the data in Fig. 1(a). As shown in Fig. 1(b), the onset temperature of the superconducting transition is used to define T\({}_{c}\). We find that the superconductivity in (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OHFeSe is very robust under high magnetic field. The T\({}_{c}\) under zero field is determined to be about 34 K for the studied sample.

The crystal structure of (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OHFeSe is shown in the inset of Fig. 2 [19, 21]. \({}^{71}\)Li and \({}^{77}\)Se nuclei sit in different layers, respectively. Such structural feature could be used to clarify spatial distribution of magnetism in this material. Although \({}^{77}\)Se NMR signal is not good for measurement because of the low abundance (7.5%), very low temperature measurement on \({}^{77}\)Se is still possible. As shown in Fig. 2, both \({}^{7}\)Li and \({}^{77}\)Se spectra at 5.5 K show a distinct broad feature. The linewidth of the \({}^{77}\)Se NMR spectrum at 5.5 K is about 4 MHz (\(\sim\)0.4 T internal field distribution), which is almost two orders of magnitude bigger than that in nonmagnetic FeSe [22], suggesting a static magnetic ordering in this material. Such broad spectrum makes the measurement at high temperature impossible with \({}^{77}\)Se nuclei. Compared with the \({}^{77}\)Se NMR spectrum, the \({}^{7}\)Li NMR spectrum is even broader and shows a three-peak structure. It is worth reminding that a similar broad spectrum is also observed in another FeSe-derived superconductor, Rb\({}_{x}\) Fe\({}_{2-y}\) Se\({}_{2}\)[23]. In that case, another narrow peak could be also observed in Rb\({}_{x}\) Fe\({}_{2-y}\) Se\({}_{2}\), which is ascribed to phase separation of SC and AFM domains. We did not observe such phase separation feature in our experiment, suggesting a spatial uniform magnetism in (Li\({}_{0.8}\) Fe\({}_{0.2}\))OHFeSe. Our results indicate that both \({}^{7}\)Li and \({}^{77}\)Se feel a broad internal field distribution due to emergence of a static magnetic ordering at 5.5 K. Such static magnetic ordering may originate from the (Li\({}_{0.8}\) Fe\({}_{0.2}\))OH layer or FeSe layer. If we consider magnetism from the FeSe layer, the \({}^{77}\)Se should feel a much broader internal field distribution than that of \({}^{7}\)Li by dipolar field calculation. Similar conclusion is also obtained in the case of Rb\({}_{x}\) Fe\({}_{2-y}\) Se\({}_{2}\)[23], in which AFM is located in the FeSe layer and \({}^{77}\)Se hyperfine coupling to Fe spins is twice as large as that of \({}^{87}\)Rb. Therefore, our results exclude that the observed magnetism happens in the FeSe layer. The only choice for the location of magnetism should be on Fe sites in the (Li\({}_{0.8}\) Fe\({}_{0.2}\))OH layer. In the following context, considering the magnetism in the (Li\({}_{0.8}\) Fe\({}_{0.2}\))OH layer with a ferromagnetic component along the external field direction, we could confirm that the three-peak structure in the \({}^{7}\)Li spectrum is caused by random occupation between Fe and Li ions in the (Li\({}_{0.8}\) Fe\({}_{0.2}\))OH layer.

As shown in Fig. 3, the temperature-dependent \({}^{7}\)Li spectrum shows a distinct broad feature as temperature decreases below 20 K. The high-temperature \({}^{7}\)Li spectrum is symmetric around zero internal field, which corresponds to a paramagnetic normal state. Since \({}^{7}\)Li has nuclear spin \(I=3/2\) and is located in a non-cubic-symmetry environment, the corresponding electric field gradient (EFG) tensor and Knight shift tensor should give anisotropic NMR spectra. Although a polycrystalline sample is used here, there is no observable anisotropic effect in the present spectrum. This means that the anisotropic effect is masked by broadening effect of linewidth. This would simplify our discussion below. As the temperature decreases below 20 K, there is an additional spectrum weight that appears on the positive internal field side but not for the negative side. This change turns the whole spectrum shape into a three-peak structure with different positive internal field shift for each peak. This phenomenon indicates that a static magnetic ordering happens and creates different internal fields on \({}^{7}\)Li sites. We mark the three peaks by Li(0), Li(1), and Li(2) as shown in Fig. 3(b). In order to explain these different \({}^{7}\)Li sites, we consider a ferromagnetic component along the external field direction on each Fe site with local magnetic moment \(m_{0}\) in the (Li\({}_{0.8}\) Fe\({}_{0.2}\))OH layer. In general, the internal field at nonmagnetic irons could contain two kinds of contribution through the transferred hyperfine coupling and dipolar coupling to magnetic irons. It could be expressed as \(\vec{H}_{\rm loc}=\sum_{j}~{}A_{hf}\vec{m}_{j}+\sum_{j}~{}\{\frac{3(\vec{m}_{ j}\cdot\vec{r}_{j})}{\vec{r}_{j}^{\prime}}-\frac{\vec{m}_{j}}{\vec{r}_{j}^{ \prime}}\}\), where \(A_{hf}\) is the transferred hyperfine coupling constant, \(\vec{m}_{j}\) is the magnetic moment at the \(j\)th Fe site, and \(\vec{r}_{j}\) is the vector connecting the Li site to the \(j\)th Fe site. We find that only considering the dipolar term cannot reproduce the observed internal field distribution, especially for the three-peak structure. Therefore, we suggest that the transferred hyperfine coupling to the nearest-neighboring (NN) Fe site in the (Li\({}_{0.8}\) Fe\({}_{0.2}\))OH layer should be responsible for such three-peak structure through the Fe-O-Li orbital mixing, which gives a positive internal field on Li sites. Because of the random distribution of Li and Fe ions in the (Li\({}_{0.8}\) Fe\({}_{0.2}\))OH layer, we assume the Li(0), Li(1), and

(b) \(H\)-T\({}_{c}\) phase diagram of (Li\({}_{0.8}\) Fe\({}_{0.2}\))OHFeSe; T\({}_{c}\) is defined as the onset temperature of superconducting transition.

  Li(2) sites correspond to Li sites with 0, 1, and 2 NN Fe ions. In this case, the internal field \(H(i)\) for different Li sites should be equal to \(A_{hf}\times i\times m_{0}\) (\(i=0,\,1,\,2\)), which is quite consistent with our observed results. Considering 20% occupation ratio of Fe, their corresponding probability should be \(P_{0}=0.4096\), \(P_{1}=0.4096\), and \(P_{2}=0.1536\), respectively(probability for 3 and 4 NN Fe ions is negligible). As shown in Fig. 3(a), we can fit the low-temperature \({}^{7}\)Li spectrum well by using three Gaussian peaks with fixed area ratio \(A_{0}:A_{1}:A_{2}=P_{0}:P_{1}:P_{2}\). Each NN Fe ion gives an internal field shift about 1.65 kOe on the Li site estimated from the above analysis of the \({}^{7}\)Li spectrum. Furthermore, we also studied the field dependence of the observed ferromagnetic components. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the separation in three-peak structure becomes larger with increasing external field from 5.2 T to 10 T. This means that the hyperfine field created by NN Fe ions is enhanced as increasing external field. This enhancement is consistent with the \(M\)-\(H\) curve in bulk magnetization measurement as shown in Fig. 4(b), suggesting a field-induced ferromagnetic component at Fe ions. Using the bulk magnetization and internal field estimated from the \({}^{7}\)Li NMR spectrum, we could estimate the effective hyperfine coupling constant \(A_{hf}\sim 0.06\) T/\(\mu_{B}\) for each NN Fe ion. Here, if we consider that the dipole field would partly compensate the transferred hyperfine field, the actual transferred hyperfine coupling constant would be slightly bigger than the above value.

In order to further understand the field-induced ferromagnetic behavior, the temperature-dependent T\({}_{2}\) of \({}^{7}\)Li is also studied. T\({}_{2}\) measurement is carried out on the central frequency of Li(0) sites under \(H=5.2\) and 10 T, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, temperature-dependent \(T_{2}\) shows a temperature-independent behavior above 20 K and becomes divergent at the low-temperature region, where the three-peak structure appears in the spectrum. Such divergence of T\({}_{2}\) is ascribed to the appearance of static magnetic ordering at low temperature. As the external magnetic field decreases, the above divergence becomes weaker, which is consistent with a field-induced magnetism. We also tried to measure spin-lattice relaxation (T\({}_{1}\)) for \({}^{7}\)Li nuclei. However, the T\({}_{1}\) is very short (\(<\)1 ms) in the whole temperature range.

(b) Relation between bulk magnetization and local magnetization. The \(M\)-\(H\) curve at 5 K is shown by black circles. The high-field part of the \(M\)-\(H\) curve (\(>\)5 T) as shown by red dashed line is obtained by extrapolating the low-field part with Brillouin function \(M=g\,J\,\mu_{B}\,B_{J}(x)\), where \(B_{J}(x)\) is Brillouin function and \(x=\frac{g\,\mu_{B}\,x}{k_{B}T}\,\mu_{0}H\). The Brillouin function gives a good fitting for magnetization data above 2 T and starts to deviate below 2 T due to superconducting signal. Red circles are the internal fields at Li sites transferred by each NN Fe ion under \(H=5.2\) T and 10 T.

The three peaks appearing at 5.5 K are marked by Li(0), Li(1), and Li(2), respectively. The red solid line in 5.5 K spectrum is fitted by three Gaussian peaks with fixed area ratio (details in the main text). The inset plot shows temperature dependence of the full width at the half maximum (FWHM) of the corresponding \({}^{7}\)Li spectra. (b) Three possible configurations for Li sites: Li(0), Li(1), and Li(2). Fe, Li, and O atoms are shown with green, gray, and red colors, respectively.

  In the crystalline structure as shown in Fig. 2, Li and Fe irons randomly occupy the same sites in the (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OH layer and only Fe ions are magnetic. In this case, the (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OH layer could be treated as a diluted magnetic lattice. In a diluted magnetic system, the effective magnetic interaction between magnetic atoms is much reduced compared to systems without magnetic dilution. The estimated transferred hyperfine coupling between nearest-neighboring Li and Fe irons from our NMR result is quite small, which supports a much weaker magnetic interaction between magnetic Fe ions in the (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OH layer. On the other hand, the magnetic coupling between neighboring (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OH layers should be also very important for the magnetism at Fe sites in the (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OH layer. Such interlayer coupling is mediated by the FeSe layer and would be also very weak considering the large distance between neighboring (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OH layers. In previous specific heat measurements, a peak below 8.5 K was observed under zero field [19]. Furthermore, the peak temperature was found to be field-independent and this was ascribed to the existence of antiferromagnetism at zero field [19]. Considering that both interlayer and intralayer magnetic couplings between Fe ions in (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OH layers are very weak, the above antiferromagnetism at zero field would be very fragile under external magnetic field. Under strong external magnetic field, such antiferromagnetism could be easily altered and a ferromagnetic component along field direction is also expected. Our present NMR results under strong magnetic field indicate that the antiferromagnetism at zero field is indeed very fragile and a field-induced ferromagnetic component appears with external magnetic field which is also consistent with previous specific heat results [19]. Similar field-induced ferromagnetism is also observed in EuFe2 As2 [24]. Although a novel block-checkerboard AFM state has been proposed to be a ground state for FeSe-derived superconductors [20], we did not find any trace of such a phase in the present (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OHFeSe superconductor. Considering the high-field superconducting transition observed in Fig. 1, we propose that superconductivity in the FeSe layer is very robust against the above field-induced ferromagnetism in the (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OH layer and both of them could coexist under external magnetic field for this newly discovered FeSe-derived superconductor. Although there is a field-induced ferromagnetism under external magnetic field, superconductivity coexists with antiferromagnetism at zero field in (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OHFeSe. How to understand the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in this FeSe-derived superconductor needs more investigations. This would be helpful to understand the role of magnetism on the mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity.

To summarize, we perform a site-selective NMR experiment on polycrystalline (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OHFeSe. Our results indicate that a static magnetic ordering appears in the (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OH layer as temperature decreases. Moreover, such magnetic ordering possesses a field-induced ferromagnetic component along the external field direction. Our present results indicate that the superconductivity in (Li0.8 Fe0.2)OHFeSe is very robust against the observed field-induced ferromagnetism and both of them could coexist under external magnetic field. This also offers a new platform to study the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism.

_Note added._ Recently we noticed a paper [25] reporting a similar \({}^{7}\)Li NMR result but at lower field.
