###### Abstract

For unconventional heavy fermion superconductors, typified by UBe\({}_{13}\), the superconducting transition temperatures \(T_{c}\) are shown to correlate with a characteristic energy \(\hbar^{2}/(m*\xi^{2}),m*\) being the effective mass, and \(\xi\) the coherence length. For four of the six materials for which \(T_{c}\), \(m*\), and \(\xi\) are available, \(k_{B}T_{c}\)\(\sim\)20\(\hbar^{2}/(m*\xi^{2})\). One heavy fermion material, UPd\({}_{2}\)Al\({}_{3}\), reveals a tendency for the above linear behavior to saturate at substantially larger \(\hbar^{2}/(m*\xi^{2})\) than for UBe\({}_{13}\). The sixth material considered, URu\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\), falls between UBe\({}_{13}\) and UPd\({}_{2}\)Al\({}_{3}\). To embrace _d_-wave pairing in cuprates, a log-log plot reveals that \(k_{B}T_{c}\)\(\sim\)\(\hbar^{2}/(m*\xi^{2})\), but more materials for which \(m*\) and \(\xi\) are measured will be required to substantiate the correlation in these high-\(T_{c}\) substances.

Although heavy fermion superconductors were discovered more than a decade and a half ago,[1, 2] interest in their physical properties remains considerable. Thus, in a very recent study,[3] the differential conductivity of a UBe\({}_{13}\)-Au junction has been measured in both superconducting and normal states, yielding in particular an energy gap \(\Delta\) in this unconventional superconductor very different quantitatively from a BCS relation which at \(T\) = 0 reads 2\(\Delta\)/\(k_{B}T_{c}\) = 3.5. This figure is "enhanced" to around 7 from this experiment on UBe\({}_{13}\). We shall return briefly, at the end of this report, to this matter of the energy gap in this non-\(s\)-wave heavy fermion superconductor. However, the main focus of the present investigation is to address the question of whether there is a 'natural' energy scale on which to measure \(k_{B}T_{c}\) in non-\(s\)-wave superconductors. Then, leaving aside \(l(l+1)\) in the eigenvalues of \(L^{2}/\hbar^{2}\), with \(L\) the orbital angular momentum of a superconducting Cooper pair, a characteristic energy \(\bm{\epsilon}_{c}\) would appear to be

\[\bm{\epsilon}_{c} = \frac{\hbar^{2}}{m*\!l_{c}^{2}},\] (1)

where \(m*\) is the effective mass, while \(l_{c}\) is a characteristic length that remains to be chosen. That \(m*\) should enter inversely in determining the scale of \(k_{B}T_{c}\) was clearly recognized in the study of Uemura _et al._,[4] who did not, however, address the question of the length \(l_{c}\) below \(T_{c}\). In the superconducting state of the heavy fermion materials which we first focus on below, it seemed to us that the natural physical choice was to take for \(l_{c}\) in Eq. (1) the coherence length \(\xi\). We have then found in the available literature simultaneously data on \(T_{c}\), \(m*\), and \(\xi\) for the six heavy fermion systems listed in Table 1 (see Ref. [5]). These are the data we have therefore used to construct Fig. 1, in which \(k_{B}T_{c}\) has been plotted against the "independent variable" \(\hbar^{2}/(m*\xi^{2})\) from Eq. (1) with \(l_{c}\) = \(\xi\). That there is a marked correlation between these two energies (both measured in meV in Fig. 1) is clear. The dashed curve, though mainly plotted as a guide to the eye, is represented over the range shown by the power series in \(\bm{\epsilon}_{c}\)

\[k_{B}T_{c} = b\,\bm{\epsilon}_{c}(1+c_{1}\bm{\epsilon}_{c}+c_{2}\bm{\epsilon}_{ c}^{2})+\mathcal{O}(\bm{\epsilon}_{c}^{3}),\] (2)

where \(b\) = 22. For the three materials shown in Fig. 1 with the lowest \(T_{c}\) values, \(k_{B}T_{c}\)\(\cdot\)\([\hbar^{2}/(m*\xi^{2})]\) = 20, as follows from the first term in the fitting series Eq. (2).

Below we shall briefly compare and contrast this linear behavior at low \(T_{c}\) with that for the _d_-wave pairing in the cuprates. However, the further point to be stressed is that the material UPd\({}_{2}\)Al\({}_{3}\), though having somewhat different coherence lengths in different crystal directions, shows a clear tendency of the (assumed) relation

\[k_{B}T_{c} = f_{\rm HF}\!\left(\frac{\hbar^{2}}{m*\xi^{2}}\right)\] (3)

to go from the linear form \(\sim\) 20\(\hbar^{2}/(m*\xi^{2})\) at small argument to \(f_{\rm HF}\)\(\rightarrow\) const in these heavy fermion (HF) materials as the independent variable \(\bm{\epsilon}_{c}\) is increased by a factor of about 5 from UBe\({}_{13}\) to UPd\({}_{2}\)Al\({}_{3}\).

 In light of the above findings for the unconventional heavy fermion superconductors considered in Table 1 and Fig. 1, it seemed of obvious interest to compare and contrast their behavior with corresponding results for the high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates, known also to have non-\(s\)-wave pairing. But then the difficulty comes up that for only very few cuprates are data simultaneously available on the same materials for \(T_{c}\) , \(m^{*}\), and \(\xi\), entering the correlation proposed in this report.

Nevertheless, in spite of the sparseness of the data, we felt it of obvious interest to show in Fig. 2 a log-log plot in which \(k_{B}T_{c}\) is again displayed versus \(\hbar^{2}/(m^{*}\xi^{2})\). The plot is, to our mind, sufficiently encouraging to warrant further work in measuring both \(m^{*}\) and \(\xi\) in other high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates. The striking difference from the heavy fermion cases is that now, accepting the wide spread of data, \(k_{B}T_{c}\!\sim\!\hbar^{2}/(m^{*}\xi^{2})\), which is, roughly speaking, one order of magnitude different from the linear limit of Eq. (2) for the heavy fermion materials.

To return briefly to the new measurements of Walti _et al._[3] on the energy gap \(\Delta(T)\) in UBe\({}_{13}\),  we have plotted their data in somewhat unorthodox form in Fig. 3, with \(T/T_{c}\) on the ordinate, and \(\Delta/\Delta(0)\) on the abscissa. Furthermore we have, admittedly with some small degree of arbitrariness, extrapolated the measured data to pass through twice the BCS value. What we wish to emphasize, in the present context of non-\(s\)-wave pairing superconductors, is that the renormalized BCS curve near \(T\!=\!0\) can be referred to as a '-gapped" phase, whereas the experimental curve shows excitations (gapless as well as gapped) characteristic of non-\(s\)-wave pairing. We expect, near \(T\!=\!T_{c}\) , that the difference between the BCS and the UBe\({}_{13}\) curves will reflect in general terms the specific heat low-temperature behavior in the normal state of UBe\({}_{13}\) , namely,

\[C_{V}\!=\gamma T\!+\!B\!T^{3},\] (4)

but it would take us well beyond the scope of the present study to attempt further, quantitative analysis on this issue.

In summary, motivated by recent continuing interest[3] in heavy fermion materials such as UBe\({}_{13}\) and related compounds,[6] we have reopened the question as to whether there is a 'natural' energy scale on which to measure \(k_{B}T_{c}\) . For the heavy fermion cases with the lowest transition temperatures, we have presented evidence that \(k_{B}T_{c}\)\(\sim\!20\hbar^{2}/(m^{*}\xi^{2})\) in these non-\(s\)-wave pairing superconductors. However, over a wider range of \(\hbar^{2}/(m^{*}\xi^{2})\) for these materials, the form Eq. (3) has been proposed, where \(f_{\rm HF}(x)\!\rightarrow\!\)const for values of \(x\) substantially larger than the value for, say, UBe\({}_{13}\)--a situation which occurs in fact for UPd\({}_{2}\)Al\({}_{3}\). Figure 2 shows the non-\(s\)-wave cuprates on the same diagram as the heavy fermion superconductors, and now, roughly speaking, we are in a regime where \(k_{B}T_{c}\) and \(\hbar^{2}/(m^{*}\xi^{2})\) are the same to better than order of magnitude.

Six heavy fermion materials are considered. The fitted (dashed) curve is represented in Eq. (2) and should be regarded mainly as a guide to the eye.
