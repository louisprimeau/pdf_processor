###### Abstract

The low-temperature properties of \(M\)Fe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) (\(M\) = La, Pr, Nd, and Th) single crystals have been studied by means of electrical-resistivity, magnetization, specific-heat, and magnetoresistivity measurements. Superconductivity among these compounds is known to occur only in LaFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\), which has a superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) of \(\sim\)4 K. The compounds PrFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) and NdFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) display features that suggest the occurrence of antiferromagnetic ordering below \(\sim\)6.2 K and ferromagnetic ordering below \(\sim\)2 K, respectively. Isothermal magnetization curves for PrFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) below 6 K reveal a spin-flop or metamagnetic transition.

## Introduction

A series of rare-earth (\(R\)) ternary phosphides with general formula \(R\)\(T_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) (\(T\) = Fe, Ru, and Os; \(R\) = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu) has been reported to form in a bcc crystallographic structure by Jeitschko and Braun.[1] This structure is derived from the CoAs\({}_{3}\)- and WAl\({}_{12}\)-type structures by filling the icosahedral and octahedral voids with \(R\) and \(T\) atoms, respectively.[1] Later, compounds with the actinides Th (Ref. [2]) and U (Ref. [3]) at the rare-earth sites were found to form with the same structure.

One of the most striking features of these compounds was discovered by Meisner,[4] who reported the occurrence of superconductivity in LaFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) with a superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) onset of 4.08 K. Together with \(R\) Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) [\(R\) = Sc, Y, and Lu (Ref. [5]), U\({}_{6}\)Fe (Ref. [6]), Fe\({}_{3}\)Th\({}_{7}\) (Ref. [7]), and FeZr\({}_{2}\) (Ref. [8]), LaFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) is one of the few Fe compounds ever found to exhibit superconductivity. Superconductivity has also been observed in the compounds LaRu\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) (Ref. [4]) and LaOs\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) (Ref. [9]) with onsets at 7.02 K and 1.83 K, respectively. Mossbauer-effect measurements on LaFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) (Ref. [10]) revealed a very small upper limit of 0.01\(\mu_{B}\) for the magnetic moment of the Fe ions in this compound, which is consistent with the occurrence of superconductivity, in spite of the large Fe concentration of \(\sim\)24 at.%. A moderately high electronic specific-heat coefficient \(\gamma\) = 57 mJ/mole K\({}^{2}\) and a specific-heat jump at \(T_{c}\) equal to \(\sim\) 87% of that expected from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity was derived from specific-heat, \(C\), measurements[11] on LaFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\). The latter result indicates that superconductivity in LaFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) is a bulk phenomenon.

Electrical-resistivity, \(\rho\), and dc-magnetic-susceptibility, \(\chi\), measurements on other \(M\)Fe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) (\(M\) denotes rare earth or actinide) compounds yield certain anomalies that can be associated with magnetic ordering or \(f\)-electron hybridization.[12]\({}^{-}\)[14] The compounds CeFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) (Refs. [12] and [13]) and UFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) (Ref. [3]) exhibit nonmetallic behavior in which the value of the resistivity at low temperatures is 6-7 orders of magnitude larger than the value at room temperature. However, the magnetic properties of CeFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) and UFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) are substantially different from one another. While UFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) is ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of 3.15 K, the magnetic susceptibility of CeFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) can be described by an enhanced Pauli-like susceptibility plus a Curie term, which can be accounted for by \(\sim\)0.3% Ce\({}^{3+}\) ions per formula unit.[3] The compounds PrFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) (Ref. [12]), NdFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) (Ref. [14]), EuFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) (Ref. [13]), and ThFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) show metallic behavior, and curves of \(\rho\)(\(T\)) for the first three of them contain anomalies that are associated with the occurrence of magnetic ordering.

Reported herein are the results of an investigation that consisted of measurements of electrical resistivity in zero and applied magnetic fields, ac and dc magnetization, and specific heat on the \(M\)Fe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) compounds with \(M\) = La, Pr, Nd, and Th. The magnetic properties of CeFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) and UFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) (Ref. [15]), the properties of UFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) under high pressure,[16] and a crystalline-electric-field analysis of the magnetic susceptibility of PrFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) and NdFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) (Ref. [17]) are the subjects of forthcoming publications.

## Experimental Details

Single crystals of \(M\)Fe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) compounds were grown in a molten Sn flux. High-purity (99.9% or better) pieces of the \(M\) elements (La, Pr, Nd, and Th), Fe, P, and Sn were placed in a quartz tube in the proportions of 1:4:20:50 and sealed off under 150 mm Hg of argon gas.

  The quartz tube was placed in a furnace and the temperature was elevated to 1050-1150 degC. The quartz tube was maintained at this temperature for about a week, and the temperature was then decreased at the rate of 2 degC/h. When the temperature of the furnace reached about 600 degC, the quartz tube was dropped into water, and the product of the reaction, consisting of several single crystals embedded in the Sn-P solution, was recovered. These single crystals, with typical dimensions somewhat less than 2 mm, could be isolated after dissolving the Sn-P matrix with a concentrated solution of HCl, which took several hours. The crystal structure of a few of these crystals was verified utilizing a Gandolphi x-ray camera.

Copper or platinum leads were attached to the samples with silver-filled epoxy, and four-lead electrical-resistivity measurements were performed using a self-balancing impedance bridge operating at a frequency of 16 Hz. The magnetic-susceptibility measurements and the magnetization curves on PrFe4P12 were obtained utilizing a S.H.E. Corp. superconducting quantum-interference device (SQUID) susceptometer, while the magnetization curves for NdFe4P12 were obtained with a vibrating-sample magnetometer.

For the specific-heat measurements, several single crystals of each compound weighing ~0.5 g were placed in a copper container with Crycon grease to provide good thermal conductivity between the crystals.18 Specific-heat measurements above 0.5 K were performed in a 3He semiadiabatic calorimeter using a heat-pulse technique.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Electrical resistivity normalized to room-temperature _r_/_g_300 K versus temperature data for LaFe4P12, PrFe4P12, NdFe4P12, and ThFe4P12 are displayed in Figs. 1(a)-1(d) and reveal a positive temperature dependence, like in typical metals. The very large residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of ~90 for LaFe4P12 indicates that the Sn-grown single crystals are of very good metallurgical quality. The superconducting transition of LaFe4P12 at ~4 K is shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a). As the temperature is lowered, _r_(_T_) for PrFe4P12 increases sharply at ~6.2 K, a temperature at which a cusp in the _kh_-1-versus-_T_ data and a large peak in the _C_-versus-_T_ data are observed (see below). Since no significant changes in the x-ray powder-diffraction pattern of PrFe4P12 were detected down to 4 K, the possibility that the anomalies observed in the _r_(_T_), _kh_(_T_), and _C_(_T_) data are due to a crystallographic phase transformation can be ruled out, and the features can more likely be attributed to the onset of antiferromagnetic ordering, as will be discussed below. Below 6 K, _r_(_T_) exhibits a maximum at ~5 K and an abrupt change in slope at ~2.5 K. The detailed behavior of _r_(_T_) for \(T\) < 2.5 K is somewhat sample dependent, while the sharp increase at ~6.2 K is not. The _r_(_T_) curve for NdFe4P12 shows a broad minimum near 33 K, followed by a sharp drop at ~2 K, which is associated with the onset of magnetic ordering. For ThFe4P12, _r_(_T_) displays a monotonic metallic behavior, with much greater scattering the (RRR is much smaller) than for LaFe4P12, while no superconductivity was found down to 1.2 K (Fig. 1).

Measurements9 (not shown) of ac magnetic susceptibility _X_ac on these compounds have revealed interesting features that can be associated with their superconducting or magnetically ordered states. As expected, there is a sharp drop in _X_ac(_T_) at _T_c for LaFe4P12, and a pronounced peak in _X_ac(_T_) at 2 K is observed for NdFe4P12, which is consistent with the occurrence of magnetic ordering, while a small peak in _X_ac(_T_) near 6 K is observed for PrFe4P12.

Plots of _kh_-1 versus \(T\) between 2 and 300 K for PrFe4P12 and NdFe4P12 are shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). Since the _M_-versus-_H_ curves to \(H\) = 1 T are nearly linear in this temperature range [see Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)], the _kh_-1 values in Fig. 2 were taken from _H_/_M_ values at 1 T. The feature at ~6.2 K in PrFe4P12 suggests the occurrence of antiferromagnetic ordering below this temperature. The linear slope of _kh_-1 versus \(T\) from 80 to 300 K yields an effective magnetic moment _m_eff of ~3.62_m_b_, very close to the Pr3+ free-ion value of 3.58_m_b_. The effective moment obtained from the slope below 40 K is _m_eff~3.18_m_b_. The difference between the values of _m_eff estimated from the _kh_-1-versus-_T_ data below 40 K and above 80 K indicates that crystalline electric fields are important in determining the magnetic properties of this compound. The linear slope of _kh_-1 versus \(T\) from 180 to 300 K in NdFe4P12 corresponds to an effective moment of ~3.53_m_b_, close to the Nd3+ free-ion value of 3.62_m_b_. The value of _m_eff obtained from the slope at low temperatures yields _m_eff~2.46_m_b_. As in PrFe4P12, the difference in the values of _m_eff inferred from the slopes of _kh_-1 versus \(T\) at high and low temperatures, as well as the slight positive departure from the linear behavior near 150 K, suggests the occurrence of crystalline-electric-field effects in NdFe4P12. Magnetic-susceptibility measurements performed with a Faraday magnetometer on different batches of PrFe4P12 and NdFe4P12 (Refs. 9 and 17) yielded _kh_-1 (_T_) plots very similar to the ones shown in Fig. 2, with slight discrepancies in the higher-temperature range, where the _m_eff values obtained were 3.64_m_b_ and 3.86_m_b_, respectively.

Further evidence for antiferromagnetic ordering in PrFe4P12 is provided by the isothermal magnetization curves shown in Fig. 3(a). For \(T\) = 3 and 4 K, a magnetic-field-induced transition is seen, characteristic of either a spin-flop or metamagnetic transition. The magnetization curve for PrFe4P12 [Fig. 3(a)] at 3 K yields a saturation value at 5 T of ~1.58_m_b_/Pr ion, much less than the Pr3+ free-ion value of 3.2_m_b_/Pr ion. Further experiments will be carried out to determine the field-temperature magnetic phase diagram for PrFe4P12 and identify the magnetic phases. Magnetization measurements were performed on NdFe4P12 at \(T\) = 1.4 and 4.2 K in fields to 5 T [Fig. 3(b)]. The magnetization at 1.4 K saturates in a field of 5 T to ~1.72_m_b_/Nd ion, to be compared with the Hund's-rule value of 3.27_m_b_. Only very small hysteresis was detected at 1.4 K, which  Figure 3: Isothermal magnetization curves for (a) PrFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) and (b) NdFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\). Solid lines in (a) are guides to the eye.

  reveals that the coercivity of NdFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) is small.

Specific-heat, \(C\), versus temperature data for PrFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) and NdFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) are displayed in Fig. 4. These data reveal very pronounced peaks at the magnetic ordering temperatures \(T_{M}\). The contribution of the lattice to the specific heat below \(T_{M}\) can be estimated from the _C_-versus-_T_ data for LaFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) (Ref. 11) and is small enough compared to the magnetic contribution to be neglected at these temperatures. The peak in _C_(_T_) at ~6 K for PrFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) correlates well in temperature with the sharp increase in _r_(_T_), and with the feature in _kh_-1(_T_). No signature of the feature in _r_(_T_) below ~3 K is seen in the _C_(_T_) data. The behavior of _C_(_T_) below \(T_{M}\) can be described reasonably well by a \(T\)3.1 law (_C_ \(t\) _T_3.1) [see inset on Fig. 4(a)], consistent with a calculation for the specific heat that involves antiferromagnetic spin waves, which gives \(C\)  \(T\)3 (Ref. 19). The departure from the \(T\)3.1 law below ~1.8 K is partly due to the contribution of the 141Pr nuclear Schottky anomaly to the specific heat. For instance, while the measured value of \(C\) at \(T\) = 0.55 K is \(C\) = 128 mJ/mole K, and the value obtained from the extrapolation of the \(T\)3.1 line to low temperatures [see inset on Fig. 4(a)] is ~9 mJ/mole K, the contribution of the nuclear Schottky anomaly to \(C\) can e estimated to be 85 mJ/mole K,20 thus accounting for most of the discrepancy observed at this temperature. The magnetic entropy in PrFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) reaches \(R\) ln2 at ~5.5 K and \(R\) ln3 at ~7 K.

The specific-heat data for NdFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) [Fig. 4(b)] also show a very pronounced peak at \(T_{M}\) ~2 K that correlates well in temperature with the divergence of _kh_, the large peak in _kh_ae, and the sharp drop in \(r\). As with PrFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\), the behavior of _C_(_T_) below \(T_{M}\) for NdFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) [Fig. 4(b)] can be described reasonably well by a \(T\)3 law. However, this is in disagreement with predictions from theoretical calculations involving ferromagnetic spin waves, which yield a \(T\)3/2 dependence.19 The magnetic entropy in NdFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) reaches \(R\) ln2 at ~1.7 K and \(R\) ln4 at ~7.4 K.

The effect of applied magnetic fields on _r_(_T_) for PrFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) and NdFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) at low temperatures is illustrated in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), respectively. The data for PrFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) were taken on a different sample from the one utilized in the measurements of Fig. 1(b). As the temperature is decreased in zero magnetic field, \(r\) first exhibits a sharp increase at ~6.2 K, passes through a maximum at ~5 K, a minimum at ~3 K, another maximum at ~1 K, and then starts to decrease again. The peak in _r_/_r_300 K versus \(T\) at ~1 K is rapidly depressed by \(H\) and is completely suppressed at \(H\) = 2 T. The sharp increase in \(r\) at \(T_{M}\) is depressed by the magnetic field, and is completely suppressed at 6 T. The temperature at which the upper maximum in the _r_(_T_,_H_) data of Fig. 5(a) occurs, as well as its magnitude, are depressed by magnetic field, which is consistent with the depression of the magnetic field value necessary to induce the features

  observed in the magnetization curves below \(T_{M}\) as a function of temperature.

Curves of \(\rho/\rho_{300\;\mathrm{K}}(T)\) in applied magnetic fields for NdFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) are shown in Fig. 5(b). The sharp drop in \(\rho/\rho_{300\;\mathrm{K}}\) at \(T_{M}\!\sim\!2\;\mathrm{K}\) is progressively broadened by the applied field. The magnetoresistivity is small and positive in a narrow temperature interval in fields \(H\!<\!1\;\mathrm{T}\), but becomes large and negative at higher fields, which is indicative of magnetic-field-induced ferromagnetic ordering, and consequently, of suppression of spin-flip scattering with onset at \(T\!>\!T_{M}\).

## Conclusions

The measurements reported in this paper indicate antiferromagnetism for PrFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) below \(T_{M}\!=\!6.2\;\mathrm{K}\) and ferromagnetism for NdFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) below \(T_{M}\!=\!2.0\;\mathrm{K}\). The sharp increase in resistivity at \(T_{M}\) for PrFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) is suggestive of Suezaki-Mori-type behavior [21], in which a peak in \(\rho(T)\) can occur near \(T_{M}\) due to partial gapping of the Fermi surface. The sharp reduction of resistivity below \(T_{M}\) for NdFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) is presumably due to a reduction in spin-disorder scattering, while the broad minimum near 33 K is not well understood.

The magnetization measurements on PrFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) below \(T_{M}\) reveal the occurrence of a magnetic-field-induced spin-flop or metamagnetic transition. The magnetoresistance measurements are consistent with this behavior. Magnetization measurements on NdFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) at 1.4 K show a rapid rise to magnetic saturation with very little hysteresis, indicative of weak coercivity. Specific-heat measurements on both compounds show pronounced features at the ordering temperatures, demonstrating that these are bulk magnetic transitions. The specific heat below the ordering temperature displays a nearly \(T^{3}\) behavior for both of these compounds. Whereas this is consistent with antiferromagnetic magnons in PrFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\), it is not consistent with ferromagnetic spin waves expected in NdFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\). Similar \(T^{3}\) behavior of the specific heat was observed below the Curie temperature for the isomorphic compound UFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) (Ref. [15]).

The \(M\)Fe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) series of compounds is particularly rich in its variety of low-temperature magnetic, transport, and thermal properties. Further work to characterize the magnetic behavior of these interesting materials is in order. Measurements of the pressure dependence of the magnetic properties may yield important details of the magnetic interactions and will be reported elsewhere.
