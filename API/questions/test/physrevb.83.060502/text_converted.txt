###### Abstract

Measurements of the temperature and angular dependencies of the upper
critical field H_(c2) of a stoichiometric single crystal LiFeAs in
pulsed magnetic fields up to 50 T were performed using a tunnel diode
resonator. Complete H_(c2)^(1/5)(T) and H_(c2)^(1/5)(T) functions with
H_(c2)^(1/5)(0) = 17 ± 1 T, H_(c2)^(1/5)(0) = 26 ± 1 T, and the
anisotropy parameter γ_(H)(T) ≡ H_(c2)^(1/5)/H_(c2)^(1/5) decreasing
from 2.5 at T_(c) to 1.5 at T ≪ T_(c) were obtained. The results for
both orientations are in excellent agreement with a theory of H_(c2) for
two-band s^(±) pairing in the clean limit. We show that H_(c2)^(1/5)(T)
is mostly limited by the orbital pair breaking, whereas the shape of
H_(c2)^(1/5)(T) indicates strong paramagnetic Pauli limiting and the
inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state below T_(F) ∼ 5 K.

REVIEW B **83**, 060502(R) (2011)

There are only a few stoichiometric iron-based compounds (Fe-SCs)
exhibiting ambient-pressure superconductivity without doping. Among
them, LiFeAs is unique because of its relatively high T_(c) = 18 K , as
compared to LaFePO (T_(c) = 5.6 K)² and KFe₂As₂ (T_(c) = 3 K).³ The
absence of doping induced disorder leads to weak electron scattering,
low resistivity, ρ(T_(c)) ≈ 10μΩ cm (Ref. [4]) and high resistivity
ratio, RRR = ρ(300K)/ρ(T_(c)) > 30.^(4.5) These parameters differ
significantly from those of most Fe-SCs for which superconductivity is
induced by doping, for example, Ba(Fe_(1 − x)T_(x))₂As₂ (Refs. [6] and
[7]), (Ba_(1 − x)K_(x))₂As₂ (Ref. [3]), and BaFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂
(Ref. [8]). With the highest T_(c) among stoichiometric Fe-SCs, negative
dT_(c)/dP,⁹ tetragonal crystal structure,^(1, 5) and the absence of
antiferromagnetism,¹⁰ LiFeAs serves as a model of clean, nearly
optimally doped Fe-SC.⁴ Because of very high H_(c2) of Fe-SCs, they may
also exhibit exotic behavior caused by strong magnetic fields, for
example, the Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state in which the
Zeeman splitting results in oscillations of the order parameter along
the field direction.¹¹ Thus, measurements of H_(c2)(T) in stoichiometric
LiFeAs single crystals can reveal manifestations of s^(±) pairing in the
clean limit¹² for which the FFLO state is least suppressed by
doping-induced disorder¹¹ as compared to other optimally doped Fe-SCs.

Measurements of the upper critical fields parallel (H_(c2)^(1/5)) and
perpendicular (H_(c2)^(1/5)) to the crystallographic c axis in many
Fe-Sc have shown several common trends.^(6, 7, 13, 26, 27) Close to
T_(c) where H_(c2) is limited by orbital pair breaking, the anisotropy
parameter γ_(H) ≡ H_(c2)^(1/2)/H_(c2)^(1/5) ranges between 1.5 and
5,^(18, 23, 26, 25) in agreement with the anisotropy of the normal state
resistivity γ_(H) = (ρ_(c)/ρ_(ab))^(1/2) above T_(c).⁷ As T decreases,
H_(c2)(T) becomes more isotropic,^(18, 20, 27) consistent with multiband
pairing scenarios and the behavior of H_(c2) in dirty MgB₂,²⁸ yet
opposite to clean s⁺ MgB₂ single crystals.²⁹ However, the more isotropic
H_(c2) at low T can also result from strong Pauli pair breaking for
H|ab, since the observed H_(c2) on many Fe-SCs significantly exceeds the
BCS paramagnetic limit H_(p)[T] = 1.84T_(c)[K].^(17, 18, 25, 27, 30)
Thus, measuring H_(c2) in LiFeAs can probe the interplay of orbital and
Pauli pair breaking in the clean s^(±) pairing limit at high magnetic
fields. These measurements are also interesting because magnetic
fluctuations may contain significant ferromagnetic contribution which
may lead to triplet pairing.³¹ Experimentally, vortex properties of
LiFeAs were found to be very similar to the supposedly triplet
Sr₂RuO₄,³² although NMR studies suggest singlet pairing.³³ Triplet
superconductors can exhibit unusual responses to a magnetic field,³⁴
and, indeed, candidate materials show pronounced anomalies, as observed
in UPt₃ (Refs. [35] and [36]) and Sr₂RuO₄ (Ref. [37]). Surprisingly, our
measurements show that normalized H_(c2)^(1/5) of LiFeAs matches quite
closely that of Sr₂RuO₄.

We present the measurements of a complete H-T phase diagram of LiFeAs in
pulsed magnetic fields up to 50 T and down to 0.6 K using a tunnel diode
resonator (TDR) technique. We found that H_(c2)^(±c)(T) shows rapid
saturation at low temperatures, consistent with strong Pauli pair
breaking. A similar conclusion was reached from torque measurements.³⁸
Our data can be described well by a theory of H_(c2) for the multiband
s^(±) pairing in the clean limit,³⁹ which also suggests the FFLO state
in LiFeAs for H⊥c below 5 K. Previous measurements of H_(c2) in LiFeAs
were performed at relatively low fields,^(5, 40) thus not allowing to
reveal the spin-limited behavior at low T. The only reported high-field
measurements associate H_(c2) with the disappearance of irreversibility
in torque measurements.³⁸ The authors supported this association by
comparing with the specific heat data. However, in our opinion, the
irreversibility field may underestimate the true H_(c2)(T) and have
different temperature dependence due to depinning of vortices. It may
also have significant (cusplike) angular variation, which would be
particularly important for torque measurements that rely on the finite
angle between magnetic moment and field. Related complications were
discussed in high-T_(c) cuprates.^(4, 1)

Single crystals of LiFeAs were grown in a sealed tungsten crucible using
the Bridgeman method and placed in ampoules.

Immediately after opening, samples were covered with Apiezon N grease,
which provides some degree of short-term protection.[4] The samples were
cleaved and cut inside the grease layer to minimize exposure to the air.
The two studied samples had dimensions of 0.6 × 0.5 × 0.1 mm³ (sample A)
and 0.9 × 0.8 × 0.2 mm³ (sample B). The superconducting transition
temperature for both samples was T_(c) = 17.6 ± 0.1 K (more than 10

There are only two data points obtained from the second crystal (sample
B). Due to lack of high-field magnet time, we could not finish the whole
phase diagram for this sample. However, two data points were obtained at
the lowest temperature of 0.66 K and are fully consistent with those
from sample A. The transition temperature in zero field was nearly
identical between the two samples (17.5 and 17.6 K, respectively). These
two observations provide a strong confirmation of the reproducibility of
the H_(c2)(T) functions.

Drawing two lines to obtain H_(c2) is a common technique in high-field
measurement. It has been pointed out that frequency versus field traces
are quite rounded leading to some arbitrariness especially at high
temperatures. Therefore, we carefully repeated this process many times
and consistently from low to high temperatures. In this way the
appropriate error bars were obtained for each trace. The data obtained
at high temperature, where we had an overlap with conventional magnets,
are in a good agreement.

Figure 1 shows the change of the resonant frequency as a function of H
for sample A for two field orientations and two temperatures and also
shows a graphical definition of H_(c2). We note that we obtain the same
values of H_(c2) from pulse and conventional magnet measurements (up to
9 T) at higher temperatures. From many such traces, both H_(c2)^( ⊥ ±)
and H_(c2)^( ∥ ±) were determined as shown in Fig. 1 and are plotted in
Fig. 2. Only lowest temperature pulse field sweeps as well as an H = 0
temperature sweep were measured for sample B. The results practically
coincide with the data for sample A.

Figure 2(a) compares our H_(c2) data on samples A and B with the
previous transport[43; 40; 41] and torque measurements.[38] Figure 2(a)
also shows the behavior expected from the orbital
Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory[44] with
$H_{\rm orb}(0)=0.69T_{c}|dH_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}}$, the single-gap BCS
paramagnetic limit, $H_{P}^{\rm BC}=1.84T_{c}=32.2$ T, as well as
H_(P)^(Δ₁) = 34.7 T and H_(P)^(Δ₂) = 20.4 T calculated with
Δ₁(0)/T_(c) ≈ 1.885 and Δ₁(0)/T_(c) ≈ 1.111 reported for the same
samples in Ref. [4]. Clearly, the observed H_(c2)(T) exhibits much
stronger flattening at low temperature compared to the orbital WHH
theory. The inset in Fig. 2(a) shows the dependence of H_(c2) on the
angle φ between ${\bf H}$ and the ab plane at 0.66 K where H_(c2)^( ⊥ ±)
is defined at a maximum of
$H_{c2}(\varphi)=H_{c2}^{\rm lc}+(H_{c2}^{\perp\pm}-H_{c2}^{\rm lc})\cos\varphi$
depicted by the solid line.

We analyze our H_(c2)(T) data using a two-band theory, which takes into
account both orbital and paramagnetic pair breaking in the clean limit,
and the possibility of the FFLO with the wave vector Q(T, H). In this
case the equation for H_(c2) is given by[39]

a₁G₁ + a₂G₂ + G₁G₂ = 0,
(1)

$$G_{1}=\ln t+2e^{\nu}{\rm Re}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\int_{q}^{\infty}due^{-n^{2}}$$

Here Q(T, H) is determined by the condition that H_(c2)(T, Q) is
maximum, a₁ = (λ₀ + λ⁻)/2w, a₂ = (λ₀ − λ⁻)/2w, λ⁻ = λ₁₁ − λ₂₂,
λ₀ = (λ⁻² + 4λ₁₂λ₂₁)^(1/2),
$w  the sake of simplicity, we consider here the case of \(\epsilon_{1}=\epsilon_{2}=\epsilon$
for which H_(c2)^( ⊥ ϵ₂) is defined by Eqs. (1) and (2) with g₁ = g₂ and
rescaled q → qϵ^(−3/4), α → αϵ^(−1/2), and
$\sqrt{b}\to\epsilon^{1/4}\sqrt{b}$ in G₁ and
$\sqrt{\eta b}\to\epsilon^{1/4}\sqrt{b}$ in G₂.[39]

Figure 2(b) shows the fit of the measured H_(c2)(T) to Eq. (1) for ŝ^(±)
pairing with λ₁₁ = λ₂₂ = 0, λ₁₂₍₂₎₁ = 0.25, η = 0.3, α = 0.35, and
ϵ = 0.128. Equation (1) describes H_(c2)^( ⊥ c)(T), H_(c2)^( ⊥ c)(T) and
$\gamma_{H}(T)=D_{1}(T)/\sqrt{\epsilon

 by either orbital or Zeeman pair breaking. Shown in Fig. 3 are the normalized \(H_{c2}(T)/T_{c}H_{c2}^{\prime}$
as functions of T/T_(c) for H∥ab where the Zeeman pair breaking is most
pronounced. Here H_(c2)^(′) = |d H_(c2)/d T|_(T → T_(c)), and our data
are shown by the thick solid black line, whereas the literature data are
shown by symbols. The reference materials include LiFeAs; [38]
Pauli-limited organic superconductor κ-(BEDT-TTF)₂Cu(N(CN)₂)Br; [48]
heavy fermion CeCoIn₅; [49] optimally doped iron pnictides,
Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ (Ref. [18] and Ba_(x)K_(1 − x)FeAs₂; [50] iron
chalcogenide Fe(Se,Te); [27] and conventional NbTi. [50] Remarkably,
scaled data obtained on crystals with different T_(c) and by different
measurements (this work and Ref. [38]) are very similar, indicating an
intrinsic behavior of LiFeAs, namely, that it is indeed closer to the
paramagnetic limit. Notably, the data for LiFeAs lay below other Fe-SCs,
except for the highest purity (RR R ≈ 87) KFe₂As₂. [51] On the other
hand, our data appear above CeCoIn₅, believed to be mostly Pauli
limited. [49] Interestingly, the data for LiFeAs stay almost on top of
the H_(c2)(T) for Sr₂RuO₄, in which limiting of H_(c2) proceeds in a
very unusual manner, leading to the formation of the second
superconducting phase. [37] Given that vortex dynamics in these two
materials is also similar, [32] the coincidence of the
H_(c2)(T)/T_(c)H_(c2)^(′) curves is worth further exploration.

_Summarizing._ Full-temperature-range experimental H_(c2)^( ⊥ c)(T) and
H_(c2)^( ⊥ c)(T) deviate significantly from the single-band WHH behavior
but are in excellent agreement with the theory of H_(c2) for the s^(±)
pairing in the clean limit. Our results indicate Pauli-limited behavior
and the FFLO state below 5 K for H⊥c.
