###### Abstract

Measurements of the temperature and angular dependencies of the upper critical field H_{c2} of a stoichiometric single crystal LiFeAs in pulsed magnetic fields up to 50 T were performed using a tunnel diode resonator. Complete H_{c2}^{1/5}(T) and H_{c2}^{1/5}(T) functions with H_{c2}^{1/5}(0)=17\pm 1 T, H_{c2}^{1/5}(0)=26\pm 1 T, and the anisotropy parameter \gamma_{H}(T)\equiv H_{c2}^{1/5}/H_{c2}^{1/5} decreasing from 2.5 at T_{c} to 1.5 at T\ll T_{c} were obtained. The results for both orientations are in excellent agreement with a theory of H_{c2} for two-band s^{\pm} pairing in the clean limit. We show that H_{c2}^{1/5}(T) is mostly limited by the orbital pair breaking, whereas the shape of H_{c2}^{1/5}(T) indicates strong paramagnetic Pauli limiting and the inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state below T_{F}\sim 5 K.

There are only a few stoichiometric iron-based compounds (Fe-SCs) exhibiting ambient-pressure superconductivity without doping. Among them, LiFeAs is unique because of its relatively high T_{c}=18 K , as compared to LaFePO (T_{c}=5.6 K)^{2} and KFe_{2}As_{2} (T_{c}=3 K).^{3} The absence of doping induced disorder leads to weak electron scattering, low resistivity, \rho(T_{c})\approx 10\mu\Omega cm (Ref. [4]) and high resistivity ratio, RRR=\rho(300\text{K})/\rho(T_{c})>30.^{4.5} These parameters differ significantly from those of most Fe-SCs for which superconductivity is induced by doping, for example, Ba(Fe_{1-x}T_{x})_{2}As_{2} (Refs. [6] and [7]), (Ba_{1-x}K_{x})_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [3]), and BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} (Ref. [8]). With the highest T_{c} among stoichiometric Fe-SCs, negative dT_{c}/dP,^{9} tetragonal crystal structure,^{1,5} and the absence of antiferromagnetism,^{10} LiFeAs serves as a model of clean, nearly optimally doped Fe-SC.^{4} Because of very high H_{c2} of Fe-SCs, they may also exhibit exotic behavior caused by strong magnetic fields, for example, the Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state in which the Zeeman splitting results in oscillations of the order parameter along the field direction.^{11} Thus, measurements of H_{c2}(T) in stoichiometric LiFeAs single crystals can reveal manifestations of s^{\pm} pairing in the clean limit^{12} for which the FFLO state is least suppressed by doping-induced disorder^{11} as compared to other optimally doped Fe-SCs.

Measurements of the upper critical fields parallel (H_{c2}^{1/5}) and perpendicular (H_{c2}^{1/5}) to the crystallographic c axis in many Fe-Sc have shown several common trends.^{6,7,13,26,27} Close to T_{c} where H_{c2} is limited by orbital pair breaking, the anisotropy parameter \gamma_{H}\equiv H_{c2}^{1/2}/H_{c2}^{1/5} ranges between 1.5 and 5,^{18,23,26,25} in agreement with the anisotropy of the normal state resistivity \gamma_{H}=(\rho_{c}/\rho_{ab})^{1/2} above T_{c}.^{7} As T decreases, H_{c2}(T) becomes more isotropic,^{18,20,27} consistent with multiband pairing scenarios and the behavior of H_{c2} in dirty MgB_{2},^{28} yet opposite to clean s^{+} MgB_{2} single crystals.^{29} However, the more isotropic H_{c2} at low T can also result from strong Pauli pair breaking for \mathbf{H}|ab, since the observed H_{c2} on many Fe-SCs significantly exceeds the BCS paramagnetic limit H_{p}[T]=1.84T_{c}[K].^{17,18,25,27,30} Thus, measuring H_{c2} in LiFeAs can probe the interplay of orbital and Pauli pair breaking in the clean s^{\pm} pairing limit at high magnetic fields. These measurements are also interesting because magnetic fluctuations may contain significant ferromagnetic contribution which may lead to triplet pairing.^{31} Experimentally, vortex properties of LiFeAs were found to be very similar to the supposedly triplet Sr_{2}RuO_{4},^{32} although NMR studies suggest singlet pairing.^{33} Triplet superconductors can exhibit unusual responses to a magnetic field,^{34} and, indeed, candidate materials show pronounced anomalies, as observed in UPt_{3} (Refs. [35] and [36]) and Sr_{2}RuO_{4} (Ref. [37]). Surprisingly, our measurements show that normalized H_{c2}^{1/5} of LiFeAs matches quite closely that of Sr_{2}RuO_{4}.

We present the measurements of a complete H-T phase diagram of LiFeAs in pulsed magnetic fields up to 50 T and down to 0.6 K using a tunnel diode resonator (TDR) technique. We found that H_{c2}^{\pm c}(T) shows rapid saturation at low temperatures, consistent with strong Pauli pair breaking. A similar conclusion was reached from torque measurements.^{38} Our data can be described well by a theory of H_{c2} for the multiband s^{\pm} pairing in the clean limit,^{39} which also suggests the FFLO state in LiFeAs for H\bot c below 5 K. Previous measurements of H_{c2} in LiFeAs were performed at relatively low fields,^{5,40} thus not allowing to reveal the spin-limited behavior at low T. The only reported high-field measurements associate H_{c2} with the disappearance of irreversibility in torque measurements.^{38} The authors supported this association by comparing with the specific heat data. However, in our opinion, the irreversibility field may underestimate the true H_{c2}(T) and have different temperature dependence due to depinning of vortices. It may also have significant (cusplike) angular variation, which would be particularly important for torque measurements that rely on the finite angle between magnetic moment and field. Related complications were discussed in high-T_{c} cuprates.^{4,1}

Single crystals of LiFeAs were grown in a sealed tungsten crucible using the Bridgeman method and placed in ampoules.

  Immediately after opening, samples were covered with Apiezon N grease, which provides some degree of short-term protection.[4] The samples were cleaved and cut inside the grease layer to minimize exposure to the air. The two studied samples had dimensions of 0.6\times 0.5\times 0.1 mm^{3} (sample A) and 0.9\times 0.8\times 0.2 mm^{3} (sample B). The superconducting transition temperature for both samples was T_{c}=17.6\pm 0.1 K (more than 10% higher than T_{c}=15.5 K of Ref. [38]). (Full transition curves of samples from the same batch are presented in Ref. [4].) Dynamic magnetic susceptibility \chi was measured with 190-MHz (sample A) and 16-MHz (sample B) TDR.[42] The magnetic field was generated by a 50-T pulsed magnet with a 11-ms rise time at Clark University. A single-axis rotator with a 0.5^{\circ} angular resolution was used to accurately align the sample with respect to the magnetic field [see inset in Fig. 2(a)]. The data have been taken for each orientation at temperatures down to 0.66 K. The normal-state data at 25 K have also been taken for both orientations and subtracted. Measured shift of the resonant frequency \Delta f\propto\chi (Ref. [42]), thus exhibits a kink at H_{c2} where London penetration depth diverges and is replaced by the normal-state skin depth. Thus, barring uncertainty due to fluctuations, it is probing a "true" upper critical field.

There are only two data points obtained from the second crystal (sample B). Due to lack of high-field magnet time, we could not finish the whole phase diagram for this sample. However, two data points were obtained at the lowest temperature of 0.66 K and are fully consistent with those from sample A. The transition temperature in zero field was nearly identical between the two samples (17.5 and 17.6 K, respectively). These two observations provide a strong confirmation of the reproducibility of the H_{c2}(T) functions.

Drawing two lines to obtain H_{c2} is a common technique in high-field measurement. It has been pointed out that frequency versus field traces are quite rounded leading to some arbitrariness especially at high temperatures. Therefore, we carefully repeated this process many times and consistently from low to high temperatures. In this way the appropriate error bars were obtained for each trace. The data obtained at high temperature, where we had an overlap with conventional magnets, are in a good agreement.

Figure 1 shows the change of the resonant frequency as a function of H for sample A for two field orientations and two temperatures and also shows a graphical definition of H_{c2}. We note that we obtain the same values of H_{c2} from pulse and conventional magnet measurements (up to 9 T) at higher temperatures. From many such traces, both H_{c2}^{\perp\pm} and H_{c2}^{\parallel\pm} were determined as shown in Fig. 1 and are plotted in Fig. 2. Only lowest temperature pulse field sweeps as well as an H=0 temperature sweep were measured for sample B. The results practically coincide with the data for sample A.

Figure 2(a) compares our H_{c2} data on samples A and B with the previous transport[43; 40; 41] and torque measurements.[38] Figure 2(a) also shows the behavior expected from the orbital Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory[44] with H_{\rm orb}(0)=0.69T_{c}|dH_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}}, the single-gap BCS paramagnetic limit, H_{P}^{\rm BC}=1.84T_{c}=32.2 T, as well as H_{P}^{\Delta_{1}}=34.7 T and H_{P}^{\Delta_{2}}=20.4 T calculated with \Delta_{1}(0)/T_{c}\approx 1.885 and \Delta_{1}(0)/T_{c}\approx 1.111 reported for the same samples in Ref. [4]. Clearly, the observed H_{c2}(T) exhibits much stronger flattening at low temperature compared to the orbital WHH theory. The inset in Fig. 2(a) shows the dependence of H_{c2} on the angle \varphi between {\bf H} and the ab plane at 0.66 K where H_{c2}^{\perp\pm} is defined at a maximum of H_{c2}(\varphi)=H_{c2}^{\rm lc}+(H_{c2}^{\perp\pm}-H_{c2}^{\rm lc})\cos\varphi depicted by the solid line.

We analyze our H_{c2}(T) data using a two-band theory, which takes into account both orbital and paramagnetic pair breaking in the clean limit, and the possibility of the FFLO with the wave vector Q(T,H). In this case the equation for H_{c2} is given by[39]

\[a_{1}G_{1}+a_{2}G_{2}+G_{1}G_{2}=0,\] (1)

\[G_{1}=\ln t+2e^{\nu}{\rm Re}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\int_{q}^{\infty}due^{-n^{2}}\]

Here Q(T,H) is determined by the condition that H_{c2}(T,Q) is maximum, a_{1}=(\lambda_{0}+\lambda_{-})/2w, a_{2}=(\lambda_{0}-\lambda_{-})/2w, \lambda_{-}=\lambda_{11}-\lambda_{22}, \lambda_{0}=(\lambda_{-}^{2}+4\lambda_{12}\lambda_{21})^{1/2}, w  the sake of simplicity, we consider here the case of \epsilon_{1}=\epsilon_{2}=\epsilon for which H_{c2}^{\perp\epsilon_{2}} is defined by Eqs. (1) and (2) with g_{1}=g_{2} and rescaled q\to q\epsilon^{-3/4}, \alpha\to\alpha\epsilon^{-1/2}, and \sqrt{b}\to\epsilon^{1/4}\sqrt{b} in G_{1} and \sqrt{\eta b}\to\epsilon^{1/4}\sqrt{b} in G_{2}.[39]

Figure 2(b) shows the fit of the measured H_{c2}(T) to Eq. (1) for \hat{s}^{\pm} pairing with \lambda_{11}=\lambda_{22}=0, \lambda_{12(2)1}=0.25, \eta=0.3, \alpha=0.35, and \epsilon=0.128. Equation (1) describes H_{c2}^{\perp\mathrm{c}}(T), H_{c2}^{\perp\mathrm{c}}(T) and \gamma_{H}(T)=D_{1}(T)/\sqrt{\epsilon

 by either orbital or Zeeman pair breaking. Shown in Fig. 3 are the normalized H_{c2}(T)/T_{c}H_{c2}^{\prime} as functions of T/T_{c} for \mathbf{H}\|ab where the Zeeman pair breaking is most pronounced. Here H_{c2}^{\prime}=|d\,H_{c2}/d\,T|_{T\to T_{c}}, and our data are shown by the thick solid black line, whereas the literature data are shown by symbols. The reference materials include LiFeAs; [38] Pauli-limited organic superconductor \kappa-(BEDT-TTF)_{2}Cu(N(CN)_{2})Br; [48] heavy fermion CeCoIn_{5}; [49] optimally doped iron pnictides, Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [18] and Ba_{x}K_{1-x}FeAs_{2}; [50] iron chalcogenide Fe(Se,Te); [27] and conventional NbTi. [50] Remarkably, scaled data obtained on crystals with different T_{c} and by different measurements (this work and Ref. [38]) are very similar, indicating an intrinsic behavior of LiFeAs, namely, that it is indeed closer to the paramagnetic limit. Notably, the data for LiFeAs lay below other Fe-SCs, except for the highest purity (RR\,R\approx 87) KFe_{2}As_{2}. [51] On the other hand, our data appear above CeCoIn_{5}, believed to be mostly Pauli limited. [49] Interestingly, the data for LiFeAs stay almost on top of the H_{c2}(T) for Sr_{2}RuO_{4}, in which limiting of H_{c2} proceeds in a very unusual manner, leading to the formation of the second superconducting phase. [37] Given that vortex dynamics in these two materials is also similar, [32] the coincidence of the H_{c2}(T)/T_{c}H_{c2}^{\prime} curves is worth further exploration.

_Summarizing._ Full-temperature-range experimental H_{c2}^{\perp c}(T) and H_{c2}^{\perp c}(T) deviate significantly from the single-band WHH behavior but are in excellent agreement with the theory of H_{c2} for the s^{\pm} pairing in the clean limit. Our results indicate Pauli-limited behavior and the FFLO state below 5 K for H\bot c.

###### Abstract

Measurements of the temperature and angular dependencies of the upper critical field H_{c2} of a stoichiometric single crystal LiFeAs in pulsed magnetic fields up to 50 T were performed using a tunnel diode resonator. Complete H_{c2}^{1/5}(T) and H_{c2}^{1/5}(T) functions with H_{c2}^{1/5}(0)=17\pm 1 T, H_{c2}^{1/5}(0)=26\pm 1 T, and the anisotropy parameter \gamma_{H}(T)\equiv H_{c2}^{1/5}/H_{c2}^{1/5} decreasing from 2.5 at T_{c} to 1.5 at T\ll T_{c} were obtained. The results for both orientations are in excellent agreement with a theory of H_{c2} for two-band s^{\pm} pairing in the clean limit. We show that H_{c2}^{1/5}(T) is mostly limited by the orbital pair breaking, whereas the shape of H_{c2}^{1/5}(T) indicates strong paramagnetic Pauli limiting and the inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state below T_{F}\sim 5 K.

We present the measurements of a complete H-T phase diagram of LiFeAs in pulsed magnetic fields up to 50 T and down to 0.6 K using a tunnel diode resonator (TDR) technique. We found that H_{c2}^{\pm c}(T) shows rapid saturation at low temperatures, consistent with strong Pauli pair breaking. A similar conclusion was reached from torque measurements.^{38} Our data can be described well by a theory of H_{c2} for the multiband s^{\pm} pairing in the clean limit,^{39} which also suggests the FFLO state in LiFeAs for H\bot c below 5 K. Previous measurements of H_{c2} in LiFeAs were performed at relatively low fields,^{5,40} thus not allowing to reveal the spin-limited behavior at low T. The only reported high-field measurements associate H_{c2} with the disappearance of irreversibility in torque measurements.^{38} The authors supported this association by comparing with the specific heat data. However, in our opinion, the irreversibility field may underestimate the true H_{c2}(T) and have different temperature dependence due to depinning of vortices. It may also have significant (cusplike) angular variation, which would be particularly important for torque measurements that rely on the finite angle between magnetic moment and field. Related complications were discussed in high-T_{c} cuprates.^{4,1}

Single crystals of LiFeAs were grown in a sealed tungsten crucible using the Bridgeman method and placed in ampoules.

  Immediately after opening, samples were covered with Apiezon N grease, which provides some degree of short-term protection.[4] The samples were cleaved and cut inside the grease layer to minimize exposure to the air. The two studied samples had dimensions of 0.6\times 0.5\times 0.1 mm^{3} (sample A) and 0.9\times 0.8\times 0.2 mm^{3} (sample B). The superconducting transition temperature for both samples was T_{c}=17.6\pm 0.1 K (more than 10% higher than T_{c}=15.5 K of Ref. [38]). (Full transition curves of samples from the same batch are presented in Ref. [4].) Dynamic magnetic susceptibility \chi was measured with 190-MHz (sample A) and 16-MHz (sample B) TDR.[42] The magnetic field was generated by a 50-T pulsed magnet with a 11-ms rise time at Clark University. A single-axis rotator with a 0.5^{\circ} angular resolution was used to accurately align the sample with respect to the magnetic field [see inset in Fig. 2(a)]. The data have been taken for each orientation at temperatures down to 0.66 K. The normal-state data at 25 K have also been taken for both orientations and subtracted. Measured shift of the resonant frequency \Delta f\propto\chi (Ref. [42]), thus exhibits a kink at H_{c2} where London penetration depth diverges and is replaced by the normal-state skin depth. Thus, barring uncertainty due to fluctuations, it is probing a "true" upper critical field.

There are only two data points obtained from the second crystal (sample B). Due to lack of high-field magnet time, we could not finish the whole phase diagram for this sample. However, two data points were obtained at the lowest temperature of 0.66 K and are fully consistent with those from sample A. The transition temperature in zero field was nearly identical between the two samples (17.5 and 17.6 K, respectively). These two observations provide a strong confirmation of the reproducibility of the H_{c2}(T) functions.

Drawing two lines to obtain H_{c2} is a common technique in high-field measurement. It has been pointed out that frequency versus field traces are quite rounded leading to some arbitrariness especially at high temperatures. Therefore, we carefully repeated this process many times and consistently from low to high temperatures. In this way the appropriate error bars were obtained for each trace. The data obtained at high temperature, where we had an overlap with conventional magnets, are in a good agreement.

Figure 1 shows the change of the resonant frequency as a function of H for sample A for two field orientations and two temperatures and also shows a graphical definition of H_{c2}. We note that we obtain the same values of H_{c2} from pulse and conventional magnet measurements (up to 9 T) at higher temperatures. From many such traces, both H_{c2}^{\perp\pm} and H_{c2}^{\parallel\pm} were determined as shown in Fig. 1 and are plotted in Fig. 2. Only lowest temperature pulse field sweeps as well as an H=0 temperature sweep were measured for sample B. The results practically coincide with the data for sample A.

Figure 2(a) compares our H_{c2} data on samples A and B with the previous transport[43; 40; 41] and torque measurements.[38] Figure 2(a) also shows the behavior expected from the orbital Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory[44] with H_{\rm orb}(0)=0.69T_{c}|dH_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}}, the single-gap BCS paramagnetic limit, H_{P}^{\rm BC}=1.84T_{c}=32.2 T, as well as H_{P}^{\Delta_{1}}=34.7 T and H_{P}^{\Delta_{2}}=20.4 T calculated with \Delta_{1}(0)/T_{c}\approx 1.885 and \Delta_{1}(0)/T_{c}\approx 1.111 reported for the same samples in Ref. [4]. Clearly, the observed H_{c2}(T) exhibits much stronger flattening at low temperature compared to the orbital WHH theory. The inset in Fig. 2(a) shows the dependence of H_{c2} on the angle \varphi between {\bf H} and the ab plane at 0.66 K where H_{c2}^{\perp\pm} is defined at a maximum of H_{c2}(\varphi)=H_{c2}^{\rm lc}+(H_{c2}^{\perp\pm}-H_{c2}^{\rm lc})\cos\varphi depicted by the solid line.

We analyze our H_{c2}(T) data using a two-band theory, which takes into account both orbital and paramagnetic pair breaking in the clean limit, and the possibility of the FFLO with the wave vector Q(T,H). In this case the equation for H_{c2} is given by[39]

\[a_{1}G_{1}+a_{2}G_{2}+G_{1}G_{2}=0,\] (1)

\[G_{1}=\ln t+2e^{\nu}{\rm Re}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\int_{q}^{\infty}due^{-n^{2}}\]

Here Q(T,H) is determined by the condition that H_{c2}(T,Q) is maximum, a_{1}=(\lambda_{0}+\lambda_{-})/2w, a_{2}=(\lambda_{0}-\lambda_{-})/2w, \lambda_{-}=\lambda_{11}-\lambda_{22}, \lambda_{0}=(\lambda_{-}^{2}+4\lambda_{12}\lambda_{21})^{1/2}, w  the sake of simplicity, we consider here the case of \epsilon_{1}=\epsilon_{2}=\epsilon for which H_{c2}^{\perp\epsilon_{2}} is defined by Eqs. (1) and (2) with g_{1}=g_{2} and rescaled q\to q\epsilon^{-3/4}, \alpha\to\alpha\epsilon^{-1/2}, and \sqrt{b}\to\epsilon^{1/4}\sqrt{b} in G_{1} and \sqrt{\eta b}\to\epsilon^{1/4}\sqrt{b} in G_{2}.[39]

Figure 2(b) shows the fit of the measured H_{c2}(T) to Eq. (1) for \hat{s}^{\pm} pairing with \lambda_{11}=\lambda_{22}=0, \lambda_{12(2)1}=0.25, \eta=0.3, \alpha=0.35, and \epsilon=0.128. Equation (1) describes H_{c2}^{\perp\mathrm{c}}(T), H_{c2}^{\perp\mathrm{c}}(T) and \gamma_{H}(T)=D_{1}(T)/\sqrt{\epsilon

 by either orbital or Zeeman pair breaking. Shown in Fig. 3 are the normalized H_{c2}(T)/T_{c}H_{c2}^{\prime} as functions of T/T_{c} for \mathbf{H}\|ab where the Zeeman pair breaking is most pronounced. Here H_{c2}^{\prime}=|d\,H_{c2}/d\,T|_{T\to T_{c}}, and our data are shown by the thick solid black line, whereas the literature data are shown by symbols. The reference materials include LiFeAs; [38] Pauli-limited organic superconductor \kappa-(BEDT-TTF)_{2}Cu(N(CN)_{2})Br; [48] heavy fermion CeCoIn_{5}; [49] optimally doped iron pnictides, Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [18] and Ba_{x}K_{1-x}FeAs_{2}; [50] iron chalcogenide Fe(Se,Te); [27] and conventional NbTi. [50] Remarkably, scaled data obtained on crystals with different T_{c} and by different measurements (this work and Ref. [38]) are very similar, indicating an intrinsic behavior of LiFeAs, namely, that it is indeed closer to the paramagnetic limit. Notably, the data for LiFeAs lay below other Fe-SCs, except for the highest purity (RR\,R\approx 87) KFe_{2}As_{2}. [51] On the other hand, our data appear above CeCoIn_{5}, believed to be mostly Pauli limited. [49] Interestingly, the data for LiFeAs stay almost on top of the H_{c2}(T) for Sr_{2}RuO_{4}, in which limiting of H_{c2} proceeds in a very unusual manner, leading to the formation of the second superconducting phase. [37] Given that vortex dynamics in these two materials is also similar, [32] the coincidence of the H_{c2}(T)/T_{c}H_{c2}^{\prime} curves is worth further exploration.

_Summarizing._ Full-temperature-range experimental H_{c2}^{\perp c}(T) and H_{c2}^{\perp c}(T) deviate significantly from the single-band WHH behavior but are in excellent agreement with the theory of H_{c2} for the s^{\pm} pairing in the clean limit. Our results indicate Pauli-limited behavior and the FFLO state below 5 K for H\bot c.
