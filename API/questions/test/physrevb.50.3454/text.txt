###### Abstract

Oxygen isotope effects have been investigated in the electron-doped Pr1.85Ce0.15CuO4-_y_. We find the exponent of oxygen isotope effect _a_O = 0.08 +- 0.01. The sizable oxygen isotope effect in this electron-doped system indicates that the electron-phonon interaction plays an important role in the pairing mechanism.

The pairing mechanism responsible for superconductivity in the high-_T__c_ cuprates is still controversial. Experiments to address this fundamental question have been focused on the hole-doped superconductors. The hole-doped superconductors have many unusual properties in both normal and superconducting states (e.g., linear \(T\) dependence of resistivity; very short coherence length). The very short coherence length will lead to a strong critical fluctuation, so a mean-field, or equivalently a BCS treatment proves insufficient.1 In contrast, the electron-doped cuprates like Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO4-_y_ (NCCO) exhibit rather conventional behavior (e.g., \(T\)2-like dependence of resistivity;2 _s_-wave pairing state;3 relatively long coherence length;3 a simple one-band electronic structure with Luttinger Fermi surface4,5). These unique and conventional properties make the electron-doped cuprate an attractive candidate for detailed investigations to extract the microscopic pairing mechanism for high-_T__c_ superconductivity.

One way to assess the importance of the electron-phonon interaction in the pairing mechanism is an isotope effect experiment. There have been many reports on the isotope effects in the hole-doped cuprates.6-14 Due to the complicated electronic and lattice structures in the hole-doped cuprates, these isotope results could be explained by several theoretical models, and cannot give an exclusive test for the pairing mechanism. In contrast, to our knowledge there have been only two reports on the oxygen isotope effects in the electron-doped cuprates, because of experimental difficulty. The oxygen isotope effect in the electron-doped cuprate was reported by Onoda _et al._15 These authors found that 0.07 +- 2.05 for NCCO with \(T_{c}\) ~ 23.6 K. On the other hand, Batlogg _et al._16 reported a small or zero oxygen isotope effect (_a_O <= 0.05) in NCCO with \(T_{c}\) ~ 24.5 K. These isotope results contradict each other, and cannot be used to assess the role of electron-phonon interaction in the pairing mechanism.

Since a reliable isotope-effect result for the electron-doped cuprate is important to clarify the pairing mechanism of high-_T__c_ superconductivity, we develop a feasible experimental technique to investigate the oxygen isotope effects in the electron-doped Pr1.85Ce0.15CuO4-_y_. We find the exponent of oxygen isotope effect _a_O = 0.08 +- 0.01. The sizable oxygen isotope effect in this electron-doped system indicates that the electron-phonon interaction plays an important role in the pairing mechanism.

Samples of Pr1.85Ce0.15CuO4 were prepared by conventional solid state reaction using Pr6O11, CeO2, and CuO. The powders were mixed and ground thoroughly under isopropyl alcohol, and then pressed into pellets, fired in air at 1000 degC for ~48 h with one intermediate grinding. The pellets were ground again, pressed into pellets, and annealed in air at 900 degC for 12 h, and in flowing nitrogen at 950 degC for 12 h, then at 1000 degC for 20 h. The cooling time from 1000 degC to room temperature was ~15 minutes.

Each pellet was broken in half, and the halves were subjected to the 16O and 18O isotope diffusion, which was conducted in two parallel quartz tubes separated by about 2 cm.9 Samples were at identical temperatures, and nearly identical oxygen pressures (difference < 1%) throughout the diffusion process. The electronic pressure transducer gauges for the 16O and 18O sides were calibrated at the desired pressures for diffusion. The oxygen isotope diffusion was done at the temperature of 900 degC and oxygen pressure of about 0.7 bar for 90 h in experiment 1, and for 135 h in experiment 2. The isotope-exchanged sample pairs were annealed in vacuum (~50 millitorr) at 900 degC. During vacuum annealing, the samples were placed in the two parallel quartz tubes which were connected together and had identical pressure. With continuously pumping of the system, the vacuum was nearly unchanged during annealing. The vacuum-annealing time is 7 h in experiment 1, and 4 h in experiment 2. The cooling time from 900 degC to 500 degC is ~2-3 minutes. The samples were furnace cooled from 500 degC to room temperature. Back exchange was carried out at 900 degC for 40 h in flowing 16O2 on the samples of experiment 2. The final vacuum annealing was done for the back-exchanged samples in a similar way. The above vacuum-annealing procedure has been successfully used for the 16O and 18O samples of La2CuO4. These samples have equal oxygen contents within +- 0.0001 oxygen per unit cell as shown by x-ray diffraction result. The oxygen isotope enrichments were determined by weight changes of both 16O and 18O samples. The 18O samples have ~83% 18O, 17% 16O in experiment 1; ~88% 18O, 12% 16O in experiment 2; and ~30% 18O, 70% 16O after back ex change.

The susceptibility was measured in a commercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). The Meissner effect was measured in a field of 4 Oe. All the samples were well aligned in nearly the same direction (along axis parallel to the field) during each measurement. The samples were held at 40 K in the field for ~5 minutes, and then cooled directly to 5 K. The cooling rates for all the measurements were similar. The data were collected during warming. The magnetic field was kept unchanged throughout the whole series of measurements except for the back-exchanged samples which were measured at a later time in a 5 Oe nominal field.

In Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), we show the Meissner susceptibility for the 16O and 18O samples in experiments 1 and 2. At low temperatures, the Meissner fractions for the 16O and 18O samples are nearly equal within +-1.5%, in contrast to the results of the hole-doped La2-xSrxCuO4 where the Meissner fractions of the 16O samples are always larger than 18O samples by ~5-8%.17

Plotted in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) is the normalized susceptibility near _T_c for the 16O and 18O samples in experiments 1 and 2. For experiment 1, the _T_c of the 18O sample is ~0.14 K lower than the 16O sample, corresponding to _a_O = - \(d\) ln_T_c/_d_ ln_M_ ~0.07. For experiment 2, the _T_c of the 18O sample is ~0.20 K lower than the 16O sample, corresponding to _a_O ~0.09. So, the oxygen isotope exponent for Pr1.85Ce0.15CuO4 is ~0.08+-0.01, in reasonable agreement with the result of Onoda _et al._15

We show, in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), the results of Meissner susceptibility before isotope exchange. The sample pairs have nearly the same Meissner fraction and equal _T_c before isotope exchange. This implies that the starting pellets of the 16O and 18O samples have the same composition and oxygen content. Plotted in Fig. 3(c) is the normalized susceptibility near _T_c after back exchange for experiment 2. After back exchange, the 18O atoms in the 18O sample were partially exchanged back to 16O (the 18O enrichment was changed from ~88% to ~30%), and the isotope shift in _T_c was changed from 0.20 to 0.10 K. This result indicates that the observed isotope shift is reversible and real.

The observed oxygen isotope effect is sizable, but _a_O < 0.5. The reduced isotope effect does not necessarily mean a break-down of conventional phonon-mediated pairing mechanism. This could be due to a large Coulomb pseudopotential _m_*. Since the ratio _E__F_/_(_a_) in
