###### Abstract

With powder-x-ray-diffraction methods, the ternary compound LaNiSi has been identified to have a LaPtSi-type crystal structure with four formula units in a unit cell of the space group _14_1_md_ with dimensions \(a\) = 4.181(1) A, \(c\) = 14.069(8) A. The agreement of the transition temperature _Tc_ = 1.20~1.26 K (10~90 % values) measured by ac-susceptibility and heat-capacity techniques provides clear evidence of bulk superconductivity in LaNiSi. The normal-state specific-heat data can be fit to the expression \(C_{\alpha} = \gamma T + \beta T^{3}\) by a least-squares analysis, where \(g\) = 8.89 mJ/mol K2 and \(b\) = 0.487 mJ/mol K2, resulting in a Debye temperature \(\Theta_{D} = 229\) K. Below _Tc_ , the specific-heat data have a dominant low-temperature behavior of the form \(\exp[- \Delta(0)/k_{B}T]\), where the order parameter \(2\Delta(0) = 3.5k_{B}T_{c}\). In addition, the measured heat-capacity jump \(\Delta C\) at the transition point is found to be equal to 1.46 \(\gamma T_{c}\), implying that LaNiSi is a weakly coupled superconductor.

Recently there have been some notable discussions on the existence of superconductivity in nickel-based ternary or quaternary intermetallic compounds.[1, 2, 3, 4] As mentioned by Nagarajan _et al._, [2] only a small number of nickel-containing binary superconductors are known in the literature and no Ni-based ternary superconductor was previously reported until the discovery of the superconductivity in Y-Ni-B. Clearly, the ferromagnetic element Ni in a compound usually has an adverse effect on the superconductivity properties. Thus, the identification of superconducting Ni-based compounds is of high current interest. In this paper, we report superconductivity in the compound LaNiSi. To our knowledge, this is the first nickel-based ternary-silicide superconductor. As shown by ac-susceptibility and heat-capacity measurements, this compound undergoes a superconducting transition at 1.23 K (the midpoint of the transition). We have also determined the crystal structure and lattice parameters of a unit cell for this compound using powder-x-ray-diffraction analysis.

Polycrystalline LaNiSi was synthesized by arc melting stoichiometric amounts of the constituent elements in a Zr-gettered arc furnace on a water-cooled Cu hearth under purified argon of about 1 atm. La with a purity of 99.9% was obtained from the Materials Preparation Center of the Ames Laboratory. Ni with 99.9% purity and Si with 99.999 999 9% purity were purchased from Morton Thiokol, Inc. and Matthey Bishop, Inc., respectively. Due to sufficiently low vapor pressures of these elements at the melting temperature of the ternary compound, weight losses during several melting and turning cycles were less than 0.1%. The arc-melted sample was then wrapped in tantalum foil and zirconium foil, sealed under argon in a quartz tube, and annealed for 10 days at 1000 degC. This heat treatment was followed by a water quench to room temperature. A microcomputer-controlled MXP3 diffractometer equipped with a copper target and a graphite monochromator for _K_a radiation was used to obtain the powder-x-ray-diffraction (XRD) patterns. As shown in Fig. 1, each peak line of the XRD pattern for LaNiSi can be indexed in a tetragonal LaPtSi-type structure5 with space group _14_1_md_. In fact, no traces of secondary phases were observed at higher angles. A refinement of the lattice parameters of the unit cell was determined by the method of least squares using the eight intense reflections for 2_th_ < 50deg and by including an internal silicon standard (_a_ = 0.543 083 nm). The lattice parameters \(a\) = 4.181(1) A, \(c\) = 14.069(8) A were then obtained. A comparison of the calculated line intensities with those determined experimentally showed reasonable agreement. In this comparison, we employed the standard atomic positional parameters for the atoms in the unit cell. Specifically, the atoms were all placed in the 4\(a\) position of the space group _14_1_md_ (the 109th space-group number) with fractional coordinates: La(0,0,0), Ni(0,0,0.585), and Si(0,0,0,419). The agreement of intensities indicates that no significant antisite disorder or vacancies are present in our sample. Four formula units of LaNiSi constitute the unit cell.

 ments were performed in a He\({}^{3}\)-He\({}^{4}\) dilution refrigerator down to 70 mK.\({}^{6}\) A lock-in amplifier served to measure these signals and a germanium thermometer calibrated to an accuracy within 0.1% was used to determine the temperatures. Figure 2 presents the temperature dependence of the ac magnetic susceptibility \(X_{\rm ac}\) for the compound LaNiSi measured in a temperature range 70 mK\(-\)3 K. It is seen that the 10-90% values of the superconducting transition signal occur at the temperatures 1.20 and 1.26 K. The quite narrow transition width (0.06 K) is a manifestation of high purity of the sample phase. The strong diamagnetic signal of \(X_{\rm ac}\) alone does not prove the existence of bulk superconductivity in LaNiSi. Convincing evidence for superconductivity is a specific-heat anomaly.

The specific heat of a piece (\(\sim\)3 mg) cut from the sample was measured in the range of 0.7\(-\)20 K with a He\({}^{3}\) relaxation calorimeter using the heat-pulse technique [7] in the earth's magnetic field. The sample was attached to a sapphire chip, which has two separated silicon films deposited on it to serve as heater and thermometer. The calibration of the thermometer was done against a calibrated germanium thermometer. For each point of the specific-heat measurements, a small heat power was introduced to the chip and the thermal relaxation was measured and analyzed to obtain the specific heat of the sample. Figure 3 displays the temperature dependence of the specific \(C\) for the compound LaNiSi between 0.7 and 3 K. In both \(X_{\rm ac}\) and \(C\) measurements the transition occurs over an interval of about 0.06 K (10\(-\)90% values). The agreement of the transition temperatures measured by both techniques is clear evidence of bulk superconductivity in LaNiSi. The specific-heat data plotted as \(C/T\) against \(T^{2}\) in Fig. 4 show that the heat capacity \(C\) of LaNiSi, in the normal state at temperatures below 20 K, can be fit to the expression \(C_{\rm s}\!=\!\gamma T\!+\!\beta T^{3}\) by a least squares analysis, which yields the value \(\gamma\!=\!\)8.89 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) and \(\beta\!=\!\)0.487 mJ/mol K\({}^{4}\), the latter value corresponding to the Debye temperature \(\Theta_{D}\!=\!\)289 K. For comparison to \(\gamma\), we have estimated \(\gamma_{\rm BCS}\) from the measured specific-heat jump \(\Delta C\) (16 mJ/mol K) at \(T_{\rm c}\) (1.23 K) using the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) relation, \(\gamma_{\rm BCS}\!=\!\Delta C/1.43T_{c}\!\sim\!9.09\) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\). The observed value

  of \(\gamma\) (8.89 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\)) is in good agreement. According to the microscopic theory of superconductivity, the specific-heat data below \(T_{c}\) have a dominant low-temperature behavior of the form \(\exp(-\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c})\). Analysis of our data shown in Fig. 3 provides evidence for the gap to be of the order of 3.6 meV, that is, \(2\Delta(0)=3.5k_{B}T_{c}\) as predicted by the weak-coupling BCS model.
