###### Abstract

The electrical resistivity ρ(T) and heat capacity C(T) on single
crystals of SrNi₂As₂ and EuNi₂As₂ are reported. While there is no
evidence for a structural transition in either compound, SrNi₂As₂ is
found to be a bulk superconductor at T_(c) = 0.62 K with a Sommerfeld
coefficient of γ=8.7 mJ mol K² and a small upper critical field H_(c2)∼
200 Oe. No superconductivity was found in EuNi₂As₂ above 0.4 K, but
anomalies in ρ and C reveal that magnetic order associated with the Eu²⁺
magnetic moments occurs at T_(m)=14 K.

The ThCr₂Si₂ structure type is well known for accommodating a
superconducting ground state, particularly in the heavy fermion
community with superconductors such as CeCu₂Si₂ and URu₂Si₂.[1] Soon
after the discovery of superconductivity in LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) at
T_(c)=26 K with the structure type ZrCuSiAs₂, it was realized that the
related compounds (AF₂As₂, with A = Ba, Sr, Ca, and Eu) in the ThCr₂Si₂
structure are also superconducting either with doping[3, 4, 5, 6, 7] or
under pressure.[8, 9, 10] While systems with Fe₂As₂ planes have the
highest T_(c)’s to date, superconductivity has been found in both
structure types with either Ni₂P₂ (Refs. [11] and [12]) or Ni₂As₂ (Refs.
[13]-[16]) layers.

Here we report the observation of superconductivity in single crystals
of SrNi₂As₂ at T_(c)=0.62 K, as determined by heat capacity, in the
absence of a structural phase transition (below 400 K). Following our
initial observation of superconductivity in BaNi₂As₂,[16] this
represents the second superconducting system in the ThCr₂Si₂ structure
with Ni₂As₂ layers. In addition, we report that our EuNi₂As₂ single
crystals grown from Pb flux are not superconducting above 0.4 K.

Single crystals of SrNi₂As₂ and EuNi₂As₂ were grown in Pb flux in the
ratio (Sr, Eu): Ni: As: Pb = 1:2:2:20. The starting elements were placed
in an alumina crucible and sealed under vacuum in a quartz ampoule. The
ampoule was placed in a furnace and slowly heated to 1050 ^(∘)C, as
described in Ref. [16]. The sample was then cooled slowly (5 ^(∘)C hr⁻¹)
to 600 ^(∘)C, at which point the excess Pb flux was removed with the aid
of a centrifuge. For SrNi₂As₂ the resulting platelike crystals were
heavily embedded in a yet unidentified needle-like impurity phase. From
single-crystal x-ray refinements, the platelike samples were confirmed
to crystallize in the ThCr₂Si₂ tetragonal structure (space-group 139,
I4/mmm). The refinement for SrNi₂As₂ [R(I > 2σ) = 3.7%] at 124 K yields
lattice parameters a = 4.1374(8) A and c = 10.188(4) A and fully
occupied (>98

The in-plane electrical resistivity data for ANi₂As₂ (A = Ba, Sr, Eu) is
shown in Fig. 1. All samples exhibit metallic behavior. SrNi₂As₂ is a
relatively good metal with a RRR[ =ρ(300 K)/ρ(4 K)] of 11, and a
residual resistivity of 7 μΩ cm. The resistivity of EuNi₂As₂ exhibits a
kink at T_(m)=14 K associated with magnetic ordering of the Eu²⁺
moments, consistent with previous reports.[21] For SrNi₂As₂, there is no
evidence of a structural transition below 400 K, in contrast to
BaNi₂As₂, which has a clear first-order transition at T₀=130 K. The lack
of a phase transition in SrNi₂As₂ is also provided by the heat-capacity
data shown in the inset of Fig. 3.[22]

Figure 2 presents the low-temperature in-plane resistivity data for
SrNi₂As₂ with fields applied parallel and perpendicular to the c axis.
In zero field, a sharp superconducting transition is observed at
T_(c)=0.66 K, defined as the midpoint of the resistive anomaly. With
increasing magnetic field, the transition remains sharp and is quickly
suppressed. The specific heat shown in Fig. 3 confirms the bulk nature
of superconductivity in SrNi₂As₂. The zero resistance state coincides
exactly with the onset of the specific-heat transition, from which we
extract a superconducting transition temperature of T_(c)=0.62 K by an
equal area construction. From a fit to the data from 0.7 to 3 K of
C/T = γ + βT² + δT⁴, a Sommerfeld coefficient γ=8.7 mJ mol K² is
obtained. Using this value, the ratio of the specific-heat jump at T_(c)
to the electronic specific heat is estimated to be ΔC/γT_(c) ≃ 1.0. From
the

β coefficient=0.67 mJ/mol K⁴, one obtains a Debye temperature Θ_(D)=244
K.

The magnetic field-temperature H-T phase diagram of SrNi₂As₂ is shown in
Fig. 4 determined from the ρ(T) curves in Fig. 2, along with the data
for BaNi₂As₂ for comparison.[16] For SrNi₂As₂, the zero-temperature
orbital critical field[23]H_(c2)^(c)(0)=−0.7T_(c)dH_(c2)/dT_(c) is
determined to be 210 and 150 Oe for H∥c and H∥ab, respectively. From
this, the superconducting coherence length is estimated via
H_(c2)^(c)(0)=Φ₀/2π[24], yielding ξ^(ab)=1477 A and ξ^(c)=1250 A.
Assuming SrNi₂As₂ is in the clean limit, values for the Fermi velocity
v_(F)^(ab)=7.1×10⁶ cm/s and v_(F)^(c)=6.0×10⁶ cm/s are obtained from
ξ₀=0.18h_(F)/k_(B)T_(c). Surprisingly, while the absolute value of T_(c)
in zero magnetic field is very similar for the two compounds, the
anisotropy (H_(c2)^(c)/H_(c2)^(b)) of the upper critical field, which is
a factor of 2.1 in BaNi₂As₂, reverses sign (H_(c2)^(c)/H_(c2)^(ab)=1.4)
in SrNi₂As₂ and the overall magnitude of the upper critical field is
nearly an order of magnitude smaller. The differences in the H_(c2)
between the two compounds may be due to changes in electronic structure
resulting from the structural transition in BaNi₂As₂ that is not present
in SrNi₂As₂.

The specific heat, plotted as C/T, for EuNi₂As₂ is shown in Fig. 5 in
magnetic fields up to 9 T (H∥c). A sharp anomaly occurs at the magnetic
ordering temperature T_(m)=14 K [consistent with the kink in ρ(T), Fig.
1], as well as a broader hump at ∼4 K. A magnetic field along the c axis
modestly suppresses the transition, consistent with previous reports of
antiferromagnetic ordering in polycrystalline samples.[21, 25

SrNi₂As₂. The upper critical field H_(c2) for H∥c and H∥ab was
determined by the resistive midpoint in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). The data
for BaNi₂As₂ from Ref. 16 is for the zero resistance state.

The inset displays the high-temperature heat capacity with no indication
of a first-order phase transition at higher temperatures.

There is no indication of superconductivity above 0.4 K in EuNi₂As₂.

It is interesting that superconductivity with very similar transition
temperatures is found both in BaNi₂As₂ (Ref. [16]) and in SrNi₂As₂
despite the differences in structural parameters caused by the smaller
Sr²⁺ ions, as well as the presence of a first-order structural
transition in BaNi₂As₂ that is possibly also magnetic. Recent
theoretical work by Subedi _et al.[26]_ indicate that the
superconducting properties of the related Ni-analog LaNiPO may be
explained within a conventional electron-phonon approach yielding a low
value of T_(c) =2.6K, consistent with experiment; the authors go on to
suggest that the Fe-As superconductors may be in a separate class from
their Ni-based counterparts. However, a scenario was put forth by
Cvetkivoc and Tesanovic;[27] involving a multiband Fermi surface in
layered FeAs superconductors to produce the large values of T_(c) may
also be an appropriate description of these ANi₂As₂ superconductors as
well. Further work is in progress to elucidate the nature of the
superconductivity in these Ni-based materials and its relation to fine
details of the electronic structure.

In conclusion, specific-heat and electrical resistivity measurements of
SrNi₂As₂ single crystals reveal bulk superconductivity at 0.62 K, which
shows no sign of a structural and/or magnetic anomaly below 400 K.
Magnetic ordering associated with the Eu magnetic moments is observed in
single crystalline EuNi₂As₂. No evidence for superconductivity is
observed in this compound above 0.4 K.

Due to the small size of the heat-capacity signal, we are unable to
properly subtract the addenda. This is particularly evident at high
temperatures where we do not recover the Dulong-Petit value. We believe
this is also responsible for the shift of approximately 1 mJ/mol K² at
low temperatures and a magnetic field of 1 T. * [23] N. R. Werthamer, E.
