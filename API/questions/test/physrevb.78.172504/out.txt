###### Abstract

The electrical resistivity \rho(T) and heat capacity C(T) on single crystals of SrNi_{2}As_{2} and EuNi_{2}As_{2} are reported. While there is no evidence for a structural transition in either compound, SrNi_{2}As_{2} is found to be a bulk superconductor at T_{c} = 0.62 K with a Sommerfeld coefficient of \gamma=8.7 mJ mol K^{2} and a small upper critical field H_{c2}\sim 200 Oe. No superconductivity was found in EuNi_{2}As_{2} above 0.4 K, but anomalies in \rho and C reveal that magnetic order associated with the Eu^{2+} magnetic moments occurs at T_{m}=14 K.

The ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure type is well known for accommodating a superconducting ground state, particularly in the heavy fermion community with superconductors such as CeCu_{2}Si_{2} and URu_{2}Si_{2}.[1] Soon after the discovery of superconductivity in LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} at T_{c}=26 K with the structure type ZrCuSiAs_{2}, it was realized that the related compounds (AF_{2}As_{2}, with A = Ba, Sr, Ca, and Eu) in the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure are also superconducting either with doping[3, 4, 5, 6, 7] or under pressure.[8, 9, 10] While systems with Fe_{2}As_{2} planes have the highest T_{c}'s to date, superconductivity has been found in both structure types with either Ni_{2}P_{2} (Refs. [11] and [12]) or Ni_{2}As_{2} (Refs. [13]-[16]) layers.

Here we report the observation of superconductivity in single crystals of SrNi_{2}As_{2} at T_{c}=0.62 K, as determined by heat capacity, in the absence of a structural phase transition (below 400 K). Following our initial observation of superconductivity in BaNi_{2}As_{2},[16] this represents the second superconducting system in the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure with Ni_{2}As_{2} layers. In addition, we report that our EuNi_{2}As_{2} single crystals grown from Pb flux are not superconducting above 0.4 K.

Single crystals of SrNi_{2}As_{2} and EuNi_{2}As_{2} were grown in Pb flux in the ratio (Sr, Eu): Ni: As: Pb = 1:2:2:20. The starting elements were placed in an alumina crucible and sealed under vacuum in a quartz ampoule. The ampoule was placed in a furnace and slowly heated to 1050 ^{\circ}C, as described in Ref. [16]. The sample was then cooled slowly (5 ^{\circ}C hr^{-1}) to 600 ^{\circ}C, at which point the excess Pb flux was removed with the aid of a centrifuge. For SrNi_{2}As_{2} the resulting platelike crystals were heavily embedded in a yet unidentified needle-like impurity phase. From single-crystal x-ray refinements, the platelike samples were confirmed to crystallize in the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} tetragonal structure (space-group 139, I4/mmm). The refinement for SrNi_{2}As_{2} [R(I\!>\!2\sigma)\!=\!3.7\%] at 124 K yields lattice parameters a = 4.1374(8) A and c = 10.188(4) A and fully occupied (>98%) atomic positions Sr 2a(0,0,0), Ni 4d(0.5,0,0.25), and As 4e(0,0,z) with z = 0.3634(1) consistent with previous reports.[17, 18, 19] The refinement for EuNi_{2}As_{2} [R(I\!>\!2\sigma)\!=\!5.09\%] at 124 K gives lattice parameters a = 4.0964(6) A and c = 10.029(3) A and fully occupied (>98%) atomic positions Eu 2a(0,0,0), Ni 4d(0.5,0,0.25), and As 4e(0,0,z) with z = 0.3674(2) also consistent with previous reports.[20, 21]

The in-plane electrical resistivity data for ANi_{2}As_{2} (A = Ba, Sr, Eu) is shown in Fig. 1. All samples exhibit metallic behavior. SrNi_{2}As_{2} is a relatively good metal with a RRR[ =\rho(300 K)/\rho(4 K)] of 11, and a residual resistivity of 7 \mu\Omega cm. The resistivity of EuNi_{2}As_{2} exhibits a kink at T_{m}=14 K associated with magnetic ordering of the Eu^{2+} moments, consistent with previous reports.[21] For SrNi_{2}As_{2}, there is no evidence of a structural transition below 400 K, in contrast to BaNi_{2}As_{2}, which has a clear first-order transition at T_{0}=130 K. The lack of a phase transition in SrNi_{2}As_{2} is also provided by the heat-capacity data shown in the inset of Fig. 3.[22]

Figure 2 presents the low-temperature in-plane resistivity data for SrNi_{2}As_{2} with fields applied parallel and perpendicular to the c axis. In zero field, a sharp superconducting transition is observed at T_{c}=0.66 K, defined as the midpoint of the resistive anomaly. With increasing magnetic field, the transition remains sharp and is quickly suppressed. The specific heat shown in Fig. 3 confirms the bulk nature of superconductivity in SrNi_{2}As_{2}. The zero resistance state coincides exactly with the onset of the specific-heat transition, from which we extract a superconducting transition temperature of T_{c}=0.62 K by an equal area construction. From a fit to the data from 0.7 to 3 K of C/T\!=\!\gamma\!+\!\beta T^{2}\!+\!\delta T^{4}, a Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma=8.7 mJ mol K^{2} is obtained. Using this value, the ratio of the specific-heat jump at T_{c} to the electronic specific heat is estimated to be \Delta C/\gamma T_{c}\!\simeq\!1.0. From the

Figure 1: (Color online) In-plane electrical resistivity \rho(T) (l\|ab) for selected ANi_{2}As_{2} (A = Ba, Sr, Eu) compounds.

 \beta coefficient=0.67 mJ/mol K^{4}, one obtains a Debye temperature \Theta_{D}=244 K.

The magnetic field-temperature H-T phase diagram of SrNi_{2}As_{2} is shown in Fig. 4 determined from the \rho(T) curves in Fig. 2, along with the data for BaNi_{2}As_{2} for comparison.[16] For SrNi_{2}As_{2}, the zero-temperature orbital critical field[23]H^{c}_{c2}(0)=-0.7T_{c}dH_{c2}/dT_{c} is determined to be 210 and 150 Oe for H\parallelc and H\parallelab, respectively. From this, the superconducting coherence length is estimated via H^{c}_{c2}(0)=\Phi_{0}/2\pi[24], yielding \xi^{ab}=1477 A and \xi^{c}=1250 A. Assuming SrNi_{2}As_{2} is in the clean limit, values for the Fermi velocity v^{ab}_{F}=7.1\times10^{6} cm/s and v^{c}_{F}=6.0\times10^{6} cm/s are obtained from \xi_{0}=0.18h_{F}/k_{B}T_{c}. Surprisingly, while the absolute value of T_{c} in zero magnetic field is very similar for the two compounds, the anisotropy (H^{c}_{c2}/H^{b}_{c2}) of the upper critical field, which is a factor of 2.1 in BaNi_{2}As_{2}, reverses sign (H^{c}_{c2}/H^{ab}_{c2}=1.4) in SrNi_{2}As_{2} and the overall magnitude of the upper critical field is nearly an order of magnitude smaller. The differences in the H_{c2} between the two compounds may be due to changes in electronic structure resulting from the structural transition in BaNi_{2}As_{2} that is not present in SrNi_{2}As_{2}.

The specific heat, plotted as C/T, for EuNi_{2}As_{2} is shown in Fig. 5 in magnetic fields up to 9 T (H\parallelc). A sharp anomaly occurs at the magnetic ordering temperature T_{m}=14 K [consistent with the kink in \rho(T), Fig. 1], as well as a broader hump at \sim4 K. A magnetic field along the c axis modestly suppresses the transition, consistent with previous reports of antiferromagnetic ordering in polycrystalline samples.[21, 25

Figure 4: (Color online) Magnetic field-temperature H-T phase diagram of SrNi_{2}As_{2}. The upper critical field H_{c2} for H\parallelc and H\parallelab was determined by the resistive midpoint in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). The data for BaNi_{2}As_{2} from Ref. 16 is for the zero resistance state.

Figure 3: (Color online) Low-temperature specific heat C versus temperature T of SrNi_{2}As_{2} (Ref. 22) for various magnetic fields (H\parallelc). The inset displays the high-temperature heat capacity with no indication of a first-order phase transition at higher temperatures.

  There is no indication of superconductivity above 0.4 K in EuNi_{2}As_{2}.

It is interesting that superconductivity with very similar transition temperatures is found both in BaNi_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [16]) and in SrNi_{2}As_{2} despite the differences in structural parameters caused by the smaller Sr^{2+} ions, as well as the presence of a first-order structural transition in BaNi_{2}As_{2} that is possibly also magnetic. Recent theoretical work by Subedi _et al.[26]_ indicate that the superconducting properties of the related Ni-analog LaNiPO may be explained within a conventional electron-phonon approach yielding a low value of T_{c} =2.6K, consistent with experiment; the authors go on to suggest that the Fe-As superconductors may be in a separate class from their Ni-based counterparts. However, a scenario was put forth by Cvetkivoc and Tesanovic;[27] involving a multiband Fermi surface in layered FeAs superconductors to produce the large values of T_{c} may also be an appropriate description of these ANi_{2}As_{2} superconductors as well. Further work is in progress to elucidate the nature of the superconductivity in these Ni-based materials and its relation to fine details of the electronic structure.

In conclusion, specific-heat and electrical resistivity measurements of SrNi_{2}As_{2} single crystals reveal bulk superconductivity at 0.62 K, which shows no sign of a structural and/or magnetic anomaly below 400 K. Magnetic ordering associated with the Eu magnetic moments is observed in single crystalline EuNi_{2}As_{2}. No evidence for superconductivity is observed in this compound above 0.4 K.

###### Abstract

The electrical resistivity \rho(T) and heat capacity C(T) on single crystals of SrNi_{2}As_{2} and EuNi_{2}As_{2} are reported. While there is no evidence for a structural transition in either compound, SrNi_{2}As_{2} is found to be a bulk superconductor at T_{c} = 0.62 K with a Sommerfeld coefficient of \gamma=8.7 mJ mol K^{2} and a small upper critical field H_{c2}\sim 200 Oe. No superconductivity was found in EuNi_{2}As_{2} above 0.4 K, but anomalies in \rho and C reveal that magnetic order associated with the Eu^{2+} magnetic moments occurs at T_{m}=14 K.

The ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure type is well known for accommodating a superconducting ground state, particularly in the heavy fermion community with superconductors such as CeCu_{2}Si_{2} and URu_{2}Si_{2}.[1] Soon after the discovery of superconductivity in LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} at T_{c}=26 K with the structure type ZrCuSiAs_{2}, it was realized that the related compounds (AF_{2}As_{2}, with A = Ba, Sr, Ca, and Eu) in the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure are also superconducting either with doping[3, 4, 5, 6, 7] or under pressure.[8, 9, 10] While systems with Fe_{2}As_{2} planes have the highest T_{c}'s to date, superconductivity has been found in both structure types with either Ni_{2}P_{2} (Refs. [11] and [12]) or Ni_{2}As_{2} (Refs. [13]-[16]) layers.

Here we report the observation of superconductivity in single crystals of SrNi_{2}As_{2} at T_{c}=0.62 K, as determined by heat capacity, in the absence of a structural phase transition (below 400 K). Following our initial observation of superconductivity in BaNi_{2}As_{2},[16] this represents the second superconducting system in the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure with Ni_{2}As_{2} layers. In addition, we report that our EuNi_{2}As_{2} single crystals grown from Pb flux are not superconducting above 0.4 K.

Single crystals of SrNi_{2}As_{2} and EuNi_{2}As_{2} were grown in Pb flux in the ratio (Sr, Eu): Ni: As: Pb = 1:2:2:20. The starting elements were placed in an alumina crucible and sealed under vacuum in a quartz ampoule. The ampoule was placed in a furnace and slowly heated to 1050 ^{\circ}C, as described in Ref. [16]. The sample was then cooled slowly (5 ^{\circ}C hr^{-1}) to 600 ^{\circ}C, at which point the excess Pb flux was removed with the aid of a centrifuge. For SrNi_{2}As_{2} the resulting platelike crystals were heavily embedded in a yet unidentified needle-like impurity phase. From single-crystal x-ray refinements, the platelike samples were confirmed to crystallize in the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} tetragonal structure (space-group 139, I4/mmm). The refinement for SrNi_{2}As_{2} [R(I\!>\!2\sigma)\!=\!3.7\%] at 124 K yields lattice parameters a = 4.1374(8) A and c = 10.188(4) A and fully occupied (>98%) atomic positions Sr 2a(0,0,0), Ni 4d(0.5,0,0.25), and As 4e(0,0,z) with z = 0.3634(1) consistent with previous reports.[17, 18, 19] The refinement for EuNi_{2}As_{2} [R(I\!>\!2\sigma)\!=\!5.09\%] at 124 K gives lattice parameters a = 4.0964(6) A and c = 10.029(3) A and fully occupied (>98%) atomic positions Eu 2a(0,0,0), Ni 4d(0.5,0,0.25), and As 4e(0,0,z) with z = 0.3674(2) also consistent with previous reports.[20, 21]

The in-plane electrical resistivity data for ANi_{2}As_{2} (A = Ba, Sr, Eu) is shown in Fig. 1. All samples exhibit metallic behavior. SrNi_{2}As_{2} is a relatively good metal with a RRR[ =\rho(300 K)/\rho(4 K)] of 11, and a residual resistivity of 7 \mu\Omega cm. The resistivity of EuNi_{2}As_{2} exhibits a kink at T_{m}=14 K associated with magnetic ordering of the Eu^{2+} moments, consistent with previous reports.[21] For SrNi_{2}As_{2}, there is no evidence of a structural transition below 400 K, in contrast to BaNi_{2}As_{2}, which has a clear first-order transition at T_{0}=130 K. The lack of a phase transition in SrNi_{2}As_{2} is also provided by the heat-capacity data shown in the inset of Fig. 3.[22]

Figure 2 presents the low-temperature in-plane resistivity data for SrNi_{2}As_{2} with fields applied parallel and perpendicular to the c axis. In zero field, a sharp superconducting transition is observed at T_{c}=0.66 K, defined as the midpoint of the resistive anomaly. With increasing magnetic field, the transition remains sharp and is quickly suppressed. The specific heat shown in Fig. 3 confirms the bulk nature of superconductivity in SrNi_{2}As_{2}. The zero resistance state coincides exactly with the onset of the specific-heat transition, from which we extract a superconducting transition temperature of T_{c}=0.62 K by an equal area construction. From a fit to the data from 0.7 to 3 K of C/T\!=\!\gamma\!+\!\beta T^{2}\!+\!\delta T^{4}, a Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma=8.7 mJ mol K^{2} is obtained. Using this value, the ratio of the specific-heat jump at T_{c} to the electronic specific heat is estimated to be \Delta C/\gamma T_{c}\!\simeq\!1.0. From the

Figure 1: (Color online) In-plane electrical resistivity \rho(T) (l\|ab) for selected ANi_{2}As_{2} (A = Ba, Sr, Eu) compounds.

 \beta coefficient=0.67 mJ/mol K^{4}, one obtains a Debye temperature \Theta_{D}=244 K.

The magnetic field-temperature H-T phase diagram of SrNi_{2}As_{2} is shown in Fig. 4 determined from the \rho(T) curves in Fig. 2, along with the data for BaNi_{2}As_{2} for comparison.[16] For SrNi_{2}As_{2}, the zero-temperature orbital critical field[23]H^{c}_{c2}(0)=-0.7T_{c}dH_{c2}/dT_{c} is determined to be 210 and 150 Oe for H\parallelc and H\parallelab, respectively. From this, the superconducting coherence length is estimated via H^{c}_{c2}(0)=\Phi_{0}/2\pi[24], yielding \xi^{ab}=1477 A and \xi^{c}=1250 A. Assuming SrNi_{2}As_{2} is in the clean limit, values for the Fermi velocity v^{ab}_{F}=7.1\times10^{6} cm/s and v^{c}_{F}=6.0\times10^{6} cm/s are obtained from \xi_{0}=0.18h_{F}/k_{B}T_{c}. Surprisingly, while the absolute value of T_{c} in zero magnetic field is very similar for the two compounds, the anisotropy (H^{c}_{c2}/H^{b}_{c2}) of the upper critical field, which is a factor of 2.1 in BaNi_{2}As_{2}, reverses sign (H^{c}_{c2}/H^{ab}_{c2}=1.4) in SrNi_{2}As_{2} and the overall magnitude of the upper critical field is nearly an order of magnitude smaller. The differences in the H_{c2} between the two compounds may be due to changes in electronic structure resulting from the structural transition in BaNi_{2}As_{2} that is not present in SrNi_{2}As_{2}.

The specific heat, plotted as C/T, for EuNi_{2}As_{2} is shown in Fig. 5 in magnetic fields up to 9 T (H\parallelc). A sharp anomaly occurs at the magnetic ordering temperature T_{m}=14 K [consistent with the kink in \rho(T), Fig. 1], as well as a broader hump at \sim4 K. A magnetic field along the c axis modestly suppresses the transition, consistent with previous reports of antiferromagnetic ordering in polycrystalline samples.[21, 25

  There is no indication of superconductivity above 0.4 K in EuNi_{2}As_{2}.

It is interesting that superconductivity with very similar transition temperatures is found both in BaNi_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [16]) and in SrNi_{2}As_{2} despite the differences in structural parameters caused by the smaller Sr^{2+} ions, as well as the presence of a first-order structural transition in BaNi_{2}As_{2} that is possibly also magnetic. Recent theoretical work by Subedi _et al.[26]_ indicate that the superconducting properties of the related Ni-analog LaNiPO may be explained within a conventional electron-phonon approach yielding a low value of T_{c} =2.6K, consistent with experiment; the authors go on to suggest that the Fe-As superconductors may be in a separate class from their Ni-based counterparts.

In conclusion, specific-heat and electrical resistivity measurements of SrNi_{2}As_{2} single crystals reveal bulk superconductivity at 0.62 K, which shows no sign of a structural and/or magnetic anomaly below 400 K. Magnetic ordering associated with the Eu magnetic moments is observed in single crystalline EuNi_{2}As_{2}. No evidence for superconductivity is observed in this compound above 0.4 K.

* [22] Due to the small size of the heat-capacity signal, we are unable to properly subtract the addenda. This is particularly evident at high temperatures where we do not recover the Dulong-Petit value. We believe this is also responsible for the shift of approximately 1 mJ/mol K^{2} at low temperatures and a magnetic field of 1 T.
