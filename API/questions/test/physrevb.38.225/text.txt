The structures of Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) and Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) have been solved and refined from single-crystal x-ray diffraction data. The structures are essentially the same and have single Cu-O sheets separated by either Tl-O or Bi-O double layers. The Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) structure is tetragonal with \(a\) = 3.87 A and \(c\) = 23.24 A, and there are strictly flat Cu-O sheets. Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) has a lower-symmetry structure which may be approximated with an orthorhombic cell with \(a\) = 5.36 A, \(b\) = 5.37 A, and \(c\) = 24.62 A; however, this ignores superstructure reflections along both the \(a\) and \(c\) axes. The Tl-O layers are much more strongly bound to each other than are the Bi-O layers; thus, better conduction along the \(c\) axis is expected for Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) relative to Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\). Superconducting transition temperatures of 9 and 90 K were observed for Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) and Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\), respectively.

Recent announcements of superconductivity at onset temperatures above 100 K in the new class of Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O (Refs. 1 and 2) and Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-O (Ref. 3) ceramics have prompted a flurry of activity aimed at the identification and structural characterization of the superconducting phases in these systems. Reports of _T\({}_{c}\)_ ranging from 7 to 22 K in the Bi-Sr-Cu-O system [4] contrast with observations of _T\({}_{c}\)_ close to 90 K in the structurally analogous Tl-Ba-Cu-O system. [5] To understand this intriguing effect of subtle structural changes in these copper-based oxides on _T\({}_{c}\)_, we have grown single crystals of superconducting phases in these systems. It is now apparent that there is a series of superconducting phases which may be represented as (_A_ [III)\({}_{2}\)_A_\({}_{1}^{\rm II}\)Ca\({}_{n-}\)Cu\({}_{n}\)O\({}_{2+2n}\) where _A_\({}^{\rm III}\) is Bi or Tl, _A_\({}^{\rm II}\) is Sr or Ba, and \(n\) is the number of consecutive Cu-O layers. Here we report on the identification and structural characterization of powders and crystals of the \(n\) = 1 phases in the Bi and Tl systems. The Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) phase represents the first example of superconductivity in the copper-oxide-based material with strictly planar Cu-O sheets.

Powder samples in the Tl-Ba-Cu-O and Bi-Sr-Cu-O systems were prepared by heating at 850-950 degC for 1-6 h mixtures of high-purity oxides (BaO\({}_{2}\), Tl\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), and CuO; Bi\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), SrO\({}_{2}\), and CuO, respectively) in sealed gold tubes for Tl (Ba) composition and open gold crucibles for Bi (Sr) composition. In the case of Tl (Ba) composition, reaction of a 2:2:1 (Tl:Ba:Cu) mixture at 850 degC in air resulted in a superconducting phase with a characteristic x-ray reflection at a \(d\) spacing at 11.5 A. Flux-exclusion measurements on this sample showed a _T\({}_{c}\)_ onset of 55 K. When the same mixture was heated to 875 degC, the x-ray data again indicated the presence of the 11.5-A line, along with trace amounts of BaCuO\({}_{2}\). This material showed a _T\({}_{c}\)_ onset of 84 K and apparent zero resistivity at 79 K. On heating to 900 degC, the 2:2:1 (Tl:Ba:Cu) mixture partially melted and the x-ray pattern showed large amounts of Ba-CuO\({}_{2}\) along with the superconducting phase and traces of Tl\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\). Flux-exclusion measurements (Fig. 1) on this product indicated a _T\({}_{c}\)_ onset of \(\sim\)90 K and electrical measurements showed apparent zero resistivity at 83 K

 (Fig. 2). We have observed a similar dependence of \(T_{c}\) on synthesis conditions in the Bi-Sr-Cu-O system but have not yet studied this in detail. Therefore, within each system, even though the x-ray patterns of the superconducting phases appear to be similar, the \(T_{c}\) of the material is strongly dependent on the thermal history of the sample. It is likely that some intergrowth occurs in the large unit cells of these materials. Examination of the x-ray powder data for Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) indicated a tetragonal unit cell with \(a\) = 3.86 A and \(c\) = 23.2 A. Likewise, the powder pattern of Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) could be indexed on the basis of a tetragonal cell with \(a\) = 5.37 A and \(c\) = 24.6 A. However, the presence of weak impurity lines complicates the indexing of the patterns. A preliminary structure for Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) based on powder x-ray diffraction data has recently been proposed.[6]

Single crystals of Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) were synthesized in sealed gold tubes by heating the reactants in the molar ratio 2:2:2 (Tl:Ba:Cu) to provide a copper-rich melt. Upon slow cooling, black crystals were seen embedded in a multiphase mix. Flux-exclusion measurements on these black platelike crystals showed a \(T_{c}\) onset at about 90 K. Electrical transport measurements indicated apparent zero resistivity at 83 K. Similarly, single crystals of superconducting Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) were grown from an off-stoichiometric 2:3:3 (Bi:Sr:Cu) mixture. Flux-exclusion measurements made on the black micaceous flakes revealed a \(T_{c}\) slightly above 9 K (Fig. 1).

The morphologies of the Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) and Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) crystals are shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). The micalike nature of the Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) flakes can be contrasted with the platy Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) crystals which exhibit a lesser tendency to delaminate. Electron diffraction studies were conducted on these crystals using a Philips CM12 transmission electron microscope. These investigations show that Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) has orthorhombic symmetry with \(a\) = 5.37 A, \(b\) = 5.36 A, \(c\) = 24.60 A with some monoclinic distortion (Fig. 4). Like the Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) system,[7, 8, 9] there is a superstructure along the \(a\) axis in Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) as well. A 90\({}^{\circ}\) misorientation about [001] between layers can mistakenly lead to the conclusion that the superstructure is along both \(a\) and \(b\) axes. A threefold modulation along \(c\) has also been observed. The Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) crystals show tetragonal symmetry with \(a\) = 3.86 A, \(c\) = 23.2 A as obtained from convergent-beam electron diffraction (Fig. 5). No superstructure was observed in this system. The crystals are essentially twin free but do show some dislo

  cations. When these specimens were cooled in the microscope using a liquid-nitrogen stage, no change in symmetry was apparent in convergent-beam electron diffraction. The symmetry appears to stay tetragonal through the superconducting transition with no appearance of a superstructure.

Room-temperature single-crystal x-ray diffraction information for Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) and Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) is summarized in Table 1. A black, plate-shaped crystal of Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) was indexed as tetragonal with cell constants of \(a\) = 3.87 and \(c\) = 23.24 A. The cell was transformed by \(a\) \(\sqrt{2}\) to give \(a\) = 5.47 A in order to allow for the presence of supercell reflections and lower symmetry distortions as observed for Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{3-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\).[7] Unlike the Bi material, the Tl crystals did not display the _a_-axis satellite modulation, and, in this respect, were similar to the crystals of Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\).[10, 11] Examination of the data clearly showed the absence of _F_-centered violations, and the cell was subsequently transformed to the body-centered 3.866 x 23.239 A tetragonal cell. The data were reduced to structure factors in the usual fashion, corrected for absorption, transformed, and averaged in _14/mmm_ symmetry. Heavy-atom positions were located by direct methods,[12] and the oxygen atom positions were determined by difference Fourier synthesis. Refinement of the structure was achieved by full-matrix least-squares analysis using neutral-atom scattering-factor curves with anomalous scattering terms for the metal atoms, a term for isotropic secondary extinction, and anisotropic thermal motion for all atoms. Metal-atom sites were found to be fully occupied within two standard deviation units. The refinement indicated a high thermal dispersion for atom O(3) with \(B\)11 = \(B\)22 = 9(1) A2 as seen in the structure of

  Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8.11 Refining this oxygen atom off its ideal _4mm_ sites results in a 0.4-A displacement, a lower isotropic thermal parameter (_B_ = 0.4 A2), and a locally distorted thallium environment. The largest peak in a final difference Fourier was 0.1 _e_/A3 located 1.0 A from O(1).

Due to the micaceous nature of the material, frequent stacking faults and imperfections occurred in crystals of Bi2Sr2CuO6. Precession and axial oscillation photographs, as well as electron diffraction patterns, showed the presence of satellite reflections as seen for Bi2Sr3-_x_Ca_x_Cu2O8.7 Unfortunately, the satellites were always observed along both the \(a\) and \(b\) axes indicating a twinning or 90deg misorientation problem. Analogous to the superstructure observed in the Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu material, the satellite reflections in Bi2Sr2CuO6 suggest a supercell where the \(a\) axis is approximately a factor of 5 times the subcell dimension. The crystals are further complicated by a modulation along the \(c\) axis with a periodicity of approximately 3 times the 24.6-A \(c\) dimension. A crystal that showed satellite reflections more strongly along one of the basal axes (assigned as the \(a\) axis) was selected. Data were collected on a "subcell" that was indexed as orthorhombic (pseudotetraagonal) with \(a\) = 5.36, \(b\) = 5.37, and \(c\) = 24.62 A. Evidence for the ~5.4-A cell edges was found in precession photographs, electron diffraction patterns, and convergent beam electron diffraction experiments. Weak violations for \(A\) centering were present in the observed data, but these reflections were not included in the structural refinement. The remaining data were compatible with the space group _Amaa_. Metal-atom positions were located from a Patterson map and oxygen atoms were found in electron difference maps. Full-matrix least-squares refinement included anomalous scattering terms and anisotropic thermal motion for the metal atoms. Within 1-2 standard deviation units, metal-atom sites were found to be fully occupied. Large anisotropic \(B\)11 and \(B\)33 thermal parameters (Table 5) for the metal atoms are consistent with the _a_- and _c_-axis satellite reflections and are probably due to "subcell disorder" (long-range order) of the bismuth-oxygen layers. The two independent oxygen atoms, O(2) and O(3), that are associated with the bismuth atoms display large isotopic motion, also consistent with the observed bismuth-layer situation. The highest peak in a final difference Fourier map was 2.9 _e_/A3, 0.9 A from Sr. Data were collected on a second crystal of Bi2Sr2CuO6 with \(a\) = 5.361(2), \(b\) = 5.370(1), \(c\) = 24.369(6) A that was grown from a Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O mixture. The structural refinement (173 independent reflections, \(R\) ~  In the single copper-oxygen sheets of Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\), the Cu\(-\)O bond distances are 1.933 A. These are longer than the corresponding bonds in Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\), 1.900 A. The additional oxygen atoms located above and below the sheets are positioned at a distance of 2.71 A (Tl) and 2.6 A (Bi) from the copper atoms. The distorted octahedra in Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) have \(D_{4h}\) (4/_mmm_) site symmetry and have copper with its four equatorial O atoms lying on a mirror plane. However, the octahedra in the Cu-O sheets of Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) have approximately \(C_{2c}\) (2/_m_) site symmetry and are alternately tilted in the (100) planes. This same arrangement of corner-shared octahedra is also found in the single Cu-O sheets of La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) (Ref. [13]) in which the Cu-O distances are 1.91 A (equatorial) and 2.46 A (apical). The tilted octahedra in La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) appear to be responsible for its distortion from the tetragonal K\({}_{2}\)NiF\({}_{4}\)-type structure, \(a\) = 3.81 A and \(c\) = 13.2 A, to the observed room-temperature orthorhombic structure, \(a\) = 5.41, \(b\) = 5.37, \(c\) = 13.2 A. The Cu\(-\)O\(-\)Cu bond angle in the Cu-O sheets is 180\({}^{\circ}\) when the octahedra are not tilted, but deviates from this angle as the octahedra are tilted. This angle is expected to be linear for longer Cu-O distances as in Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) and the R\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) phases where \(R\) is Pr, Nd, Sm, or Gd.[14] However, the tendency for Cu\(-\)O\(-\)Cu bond bending, and thus octahedra tilting, increases as the Cu-O distance decreases. All previously known copper oxide superconductors had bent Cu\(-\)O\(-\)Cu bonds; thus, the Cu-O sheets were not strictly planar. The Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) phase represents the first example of superconductivity in a copper-oxide-based material where the Cu-O sheets are strictly planar.

Barium ions reside just above and below the Cu-O single sheets of Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) in nine coordination with oxygen. The Ba-Cu-Ba layers alternate with a double thallium-oxygen layer giving a layer repeat sequence of \(\cdots\) Tl-Tl-Ba-Cu-Ba \(\cdots\) along the \(c\) direction. Thallium bonds to six oxygen atoms in a distorted octahedral arrangement. The Tl-O double layers are essentially identical to those found in Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) (Ref. [11]) and are composed of edge-sharing Tl\({}_{6}\) octahedra. The size of the \(a\) axis tends to be determined by the Cu\(-\)O bonds in the Cu-O sheets, and the spacing of the Tl and O in the _a-b_ plane is constrained by symmetry to give Tl-O distances of 2.73 A if Tl and O(3) have the same \(z\) parameter. This Tl-O distance of 2.73 A is much larger than the 2.29-A value calculated from the sum of Tl\({}^{\rm III}\) and O\({}^{\rm II}\)\({}^{-}\) radii.[15] Some compensation of these long distances occurs through short Tl-O distances of 2.00 and 2.04 A along the \(c\) axis. As observed in Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{0}\),[11] the oxygen atom situated in the Tl-O layers, O(3), shows highly anisotropic dispersion when refined on the _4e_ site (\(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},z\)). With O(3) statistically distributed on the 16\(n\) sites, the locally distorted Tl environment then contains two short and two long intrasheet Tl-O distances of 2.50 and 3.01 A.

A similar structural arrangement exists for Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) with regard to the metal-atom layers, but, because of apparent disorder in the subcell, the precise nature of the bismuth-oxygen bonding is not yet understood. The same situation is also observed in the double bismuth-oxygen layers of Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{3-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\). Single-crystal and powder neutron-diffraction experiments are in progress with the goal of understanding the bismuth-oxygen atomic arrangement and bonding.

The nature of the Bi-O versus the Tl\(-\)O bonding within the double layers is likely to be responsible for the different morphologies of the two materials. The micalike character of Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) and Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) is presumably due to weak intersheet Bi\(-\)O bonds. In these materials, the distance between adjacent bismuth sheets is \(\sim\) 3.25 A. Cleavage between the Bi-O layers yields charge neutral sections. The interaction between the neighboring Tl-O sheets in Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) and Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) is much stronger. Intersheet Tl\(-\)O bonds are \(\sim\) 2.0 A in length and the separation between the two Tl  layers is 2.2 A, which makes the crystals brittle and more difficult to cleave. The difference in the intersheet bonding of the Tl-O and Bi-O double layers is reflected in the _c_-axis length of the two compounds. Although the average ionic radii [15] of Tl (Ba) (1.18 A) and Bi (Sr) (1.17 A) are almost identical, the \(c\) axis for the bismuth phase is 1.4 A longer than that of the thallium material.

The structures of both Tl2Ba2CuO6 and Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 are tetragonal by diffraction measurements that actually determine the average symmetry of many unit cells. However, the disorder of the oxygens in the Tl-O double layers indicates that the local symmetry is lower than tetragonal. A similar situation exists for certain La1+_x_Ba2-_Cu  * [10] R. M.
