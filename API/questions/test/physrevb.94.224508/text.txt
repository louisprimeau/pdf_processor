###### Abstract

Prior to the superconducting transition at \(T_{\rm c}\approx 2.3\) K, Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\) undergoes a symmetry-lowering, cubic-to-tetragonal structural transition at \(T_{\rm s}=53\) K. We have monitored the pressure dependence of these two transitions by measuring the resistivity of Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\) single crystals under various hydrostatic pressures up to 15 GPa. The application of external pressure enhances \(T_{\rm c}\) but suppresses \(T_{\rm s}\) until \(P_{\rm c}\approx 10\) GPa, above which a pressure-induced first-order structural transition takes place and is manifested by the phase coexistence in the pressure range \(8\leqslant P\leqslant 12\) GPa. The cubic phase above 12 GPa is also found to be superconducting with a higher \(T_{\rm c}\approx 6\) K that decreases slightly with further increasing pressure. The variations with pressure of \(T_{\rm c}\) and \(T_{\rm s}\) satisfy the Bilbro-McMillan equation, i.e. \(T_{\rm c}^{\ast}T_{\rm s}^{1-\ast}=\) constant, thus suggesting the competition of superconductivity with the structural transition that has been proposed to be accompanied with a spin-gap formation at \(T_{\rm s}\). Our first-principles calculations suggest the importance of magnetism that competes with the superconductivity in Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\).

## I Introduction

In recent years, quantum criticality has been considered as a universal organizing principle for several families of unconventional superconductors [1], including the heavy-Fermion, cuprate, and iron-based high-\(T_{\rm c}\) superconductors, in which the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{\rm c}\) can usually be enhanced by suppressing a competing electronic order in the normal state via chemical doping or the application of high pressure. To unravel the competitive nature of superconductivity with other electronic orders can not only clarify the key factors governing \(T_{\rm c}\), but also deepen our understanding on the pairing mechanism for the observed superconductivity. In this paper, we have applied this approach to reveal a competitive coexistence of superconductivity with a structural transition in Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\) that has been suggested to be a model system to study the interplay between superconductivity, magnetism, and structural transition [2,3].

Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\) has been known since the 1960s as the only compound in the Mo-Sb binary system [4]. The revival of interest in this compound arises from the recent discovery of superconductivity below \(T_{\rm c}\approx 2.1\) K as well as the promising thermoelectric properties upon proper doping [5, 6, 7]. Although much effort has been devoted to clarify the pairing mechanism of superconductivity, there has been no consensus reached so far. Point-contact Andreev-reflection measurements found a strong anisotropy of the superconducting gap parameter \(\Delta(\Delta_{\rm max}/\Delta_{\rm min}>40)\), suggesting an unconventional (\(s+g\))-wave pairing symmetry [8,9]. In contrast, specific-heat, nuclear quadrupole resonance, and muon-spin-ration studies on Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\) support a conventional \(s\)-wave Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductor; however, it remains under debate whether the superconducting state consists of a single, isotropic gap or two different gaps [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Moreover, Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\) has been suggested as a coexistent superconductor-spin fluctuation system, in which the observed \(T_{\rm c}\) can be explained only after considering the paramagnon effect in the McMillan equation [16]. Tran _et al._[17] studied the electrical and magnetic properties of polycrystalline Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\) under pressures up to 2.2 GPa in the temperature range 0.4-80 K. They proposed a pressure-induced spin density wave competes with superconductivity. These arguments point to an unconventional nature of the observed superconductivity and might have a deep root in the peculiar normal state.

Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\) crystallizes in the Ir\({}_{3}\)Ge\({}_{7}\)-type cubic structure with space group \(Im\)-\(3m\) at room temperature [18]. The Mo sublattice is characterized by a three-dimensional network of Mo-Mo dumbbells formed by the nearest-neighbor (NN) bond of \(\sim\)3 A. Alternatively, the Mo sublattice can be regarded as Mo6 octahedral cages at the body-centered positions; these octahedral cages are formed by the next-NN (NNN) Mo-Mo bond of \(\sim\)4.6 A and are connected with each other by the NN bond, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Prior to the superconductivity transition, Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\) undergoes a symmetry-lowering, cubic-to-tetragonal structural transition at \(T_{\rm s}\approx 53\) K. Previous studies have suggested that the structural transition at \(T_{\rm s}\) is accompanied with the opening of a spin pseudogap of \(\Delta_{s}/\kappa_{B}\approx 120\) K, which has been attributed to the formation of Mo-Mo spin-singlet dimers [19, 20, 21, 15]. The importance of magnetism on the structural transition has also been highlighted in a recent study on the lightly doped Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\)[3]. The fact that the NN Mo-Mo bond length along the \(c\) axis is about 0.3% shorter than those within the \(ab\) plane in the tetragonal phase, Fig. 1(b), indicated that the spin-singlet states could occur only along the \(c\) axis, leaving the remaining conduction \(4d\) electrons of Mo forming the superconductivity states below \(T_{\rm c}\)[22]. Such a scenario could make Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\) a rare example where the localized spin-singlet states coexist with superconducting states below \(T_{\rm c}\)[22]. This might be responsible for the above-mentioned contradictions about the mechanism of superconductivity. Although the issue of whether there is any correlation between \(T_{\rm s}\) and \(T_{\rm c}\) has been raised before [19], direct evidence to confirm the competitive nature of superconductivity with the structural transition or the spin-singlet states remains lacking. In addition, with a structural transition and spin-gap formation above the superconductivity transition, Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\) can be also regarded as an interesting system to explore the quantum criticality with an intimated interplay between lattice instability, magnetism, and superconductivity [2, 3]. By utilizing high pressure as a clean tuning knob, we demonstrate in this paper the competitive coexistence of superconductivity with the structural transition, which should serve as a constraint when discussing the mechanism of observed superconductivity in Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\).

## II Experimental details

Single crystals of Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\) used in this paper were grown out of Sb flux. Detailed characterizations on the structural transition and physical properties at the normal and superconducting states have been given elsewhere [2]. All high-pressure resistivity measurements were performed with the standard four-probe method in two different cubic-anvil-type apparatuses [23, 24]. The first one employs a 250-ton hydraulic press to maintain a constant loading force over massive BeCu guide blocks during cooling down to the lowest temperature \(\sim\)2 K [23], while the second one is a miniature, clamp-type "Palm" cubic-anvil cell [24], which enables integration with a \({}^{3}\)He refrigerator. For both cases, the applied uniaxial loading force is converted by a pair of guide blocks to three-axis compression on a cubic solid gasket made of either pyrophyllite or MgO. The sample was immersed in the liquid pressure-transmitting medium contained in a Teflon capsule that was put in the center of the solid gasket. Four gold wires attached on the sample were introduced out of the Teflon capsule and placed to direct contact with the tungsten-carbide or sintered-diamond anvils. The anvil's top sizes of 4 and 2.5 mm have been chosen to generate pressures up to 8 and 15 GPa, respectively. For the constant-force apparatus, the pressure was calibrated at room temperature by monitoring the characteristic resistance change of Bismuth (Bi) at 2.55 and 7.7 GPa [23]; for the Palm cubic-anvil cell, the pressure after clamping was calibrated at low temperatures by monitoring the superconducting transition temperature of lead (Pb) [25]. Our first-principles calculations were performed using the all-electron plane-wave density functional theory code WIEN2K [26] in an attempt to understand the observed pressure effect and the potential relevance of magnetism.

## III Results and discussions

In this paper, we have studied three different pieces of Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\) crystals from the same batch; two pieces were measured with the constant-force apparatus, the third with the Palm cubic-anvil cell. The ambient-pressure resistivity \(\rho(T)\) shown in Fig. 2(a) is consistent with the previously reported data [2, 19], featured by a quick decrease at \(T_{\rm s}\) before finally dropping to zero resistivity at \(T_{\rm c}\). To better illustrate these transitions, in the following, we define \(T_{\rm s}\) as the maximum of \(d\rho/dT\) and \(T_{\rm c}\) as the middle point between 10 and 90% drop of resistivity. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and Table 1, these three samples show similar \(T_{\rm s}\approx\) 46(1) K and nearly identical \(T_{\rm c}\approx\) 2.4(1) K, the latter being among the highest \(T_{\rm c}\) ever reported for Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\). It should be noted that characteristic anomalies can be observed in magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and resistivity around \(T_{\rm s}\)[2, 19], but \(T_{\rm s}\) defined from the maximum of \(d\rho/dT\) is slightly lower than that determined directly from the low-temperature structural study [22]. Nevertheless, it allows us to track down the systematic variation of \(T_{\rm s}\) with pressure. As noted previously, the normal-state \(\rho(T)\) of Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\) is featured by a rather small residual resistivity ratio \(RRR\equiv\rho(300)/\rho(5~{}{\rm K})~{}\leqslant\) 1.5. Single crystals used in this paper show slightly higher \(RRR\) values between 1.77 and 2.37. In addition, we have also performed fitting to the \(\rho(T)\) data between \(T_{\rm c}\) and \(T_{\rm s}\) with a gap function, viz.

Figure 1: The Mo sublattice of Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\) that consists of Mo6 octahedral cages at the body-center positions formed by the NNN Mo-Mo bond of \(\sim\)4.6 Å and connected via the NN Mo-Mo bond of \(\sim\)3 Å in the cubic (left) and tetragonal (right) phase. The NN Mo-Mo bond length along the \(c\) axis is about 0.3% shorter than those within the \(ab\) plane in the tetragonal phase [21].

  \(\rho(T)=\rho_{0}+AT+B\exp(-\Delta_{s}/\kappa_{B}T)\). The obtained spin gaps of \(\Delta_{s}/\kappa_{B}\sim\,100\) K are also close to the reported values [2,19,20]. The characteristic temperatures and fitting parameters for these three samples are listed in Table 1. The above characterizations thus ensure the samples' quality, and we are in the position to present the \(\rho(T)\) data under high pressures.

We first loaded the sample #1 in a constant-force apparatus equipped with tungsten-carbide anvils (4 mm top) and measured its resistivity \(\rho(T)\) between 2 and 8 GPa. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the \(\rho(T)\) in the normal states decreases steadily upon increasing pressure, and the anomaly at \(T_{\rm s}\) shifts down to lower temperatures gradually. In addition, the anomaly at \(T_{\rm s}\) changes from a cusp- to a humplike feature for \(P>\) 5 GPa. As shown in the top panel of Fig. 2(a), the variation of \(T_{\rm s}\) with pressure can be seen more clearly from the maximum of \(d\rho/dT\), whose magnitude also decreases with pressure. In contrast, the superconductivity transition shown in Fig. 2(b) moves up quickly with pressure and reaches about 3.5 K at 7 GPa, where an obvious broad transition is evidenced. Upon further increasing pressure to 8 GPa, the superconducting transition exhibits a two-step feature with the onset temperature over 5 K. The measurements on sample #1 show that the application of external pressure suppresses \(T_{\rm s}\) but enhances \(T_{\rm c}\). Resistivity measurements under higher pressures are needed to verify: (i) whether the two-step superconducting transition at 8 GPa is caused by an extrinsic pressure inhomogeneity or due to an intrinsic two-phase coexistence, and (ii) how will the \(T_{\rm s}\) evolves with pressure or whether a quantum phase transition can be realized by suppressing completely the cubic-to-tetragonal transition at \(T_{\rm s}\).

These questions are addressed after measurements on the sample #2 up to 12 GPa by changing the tungsten-carbide anvils to the sintered-diamond anvils. As shown in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d), the following features are noteworthy: (i) the anomaly at \(T_{\rm s}\) decreases continuously and cannot be discerned any more at \(P=\) 12 GPa; (ii) the two-step superconducting transition is readily observed at \(P=\) 8.4 GPa, but at 9.6 GPa and above, it changes to a single transition that is coincident with the high-temperature drop of 8.4 GPa data; (iii) \(T_{\rm c}\) decreases slightly with further increasing pressure above 9.6 GPa. These observations unambiguously rule out the extrinsic pressure inhomogeneity as the origin for the two-step superconducting transition, pointing to an intrinsic coexistence of two superconducting phases with different \(T_{\rm c}\).

The top panels of (a), (c), and (e) display the temperature derivative \(d\rho/dT\) to show the variation of \(T_{\rm s}\) as a function of pressure. (b), (d), and (f) highlight the low-temperature superconducting transition. In (e), the \(\rho(T)\) at 15 GPa can be described excellently by \(\rho(T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{\beta}\) with \(\beta=1.52(2)\) in a large temperature range \(7\,<\,T\,<\,55\) K, shown as the broken curve.

  high-pressure phase above \(P_{\rm c}\approx 10\) GPa should remain cubic down to the lowest temperature and becomes a superconductor with a higher \(T_{\rm c}\approx 6\) K than the low-pressure tetragonal phase. All these observations based on two different samples were further confirmed on the sample #3 measured with a Palm cubic-anvil-cell apparatus up to 15 GPa, as seen in Figs. 2(e) and 2(f). In this case, the two-phase coexistence takes place around 10 GPa, which is about 1.5 GPa higher than that of samples #1 and #2, presumably due to the slight pressure variations upon cooling for the clamp-type Palm cubic-anvil cell. Interestingly, we found that the resistivity at 15 GPa follows excellently the \(\rho(T)\sim T^{1.5}\) behavior for \(7<T<55\) K, signaling the importance of magnetic fluctuations on the incoherent scattering of quasiparticles in the cubic phase above \(P_{\rm c}\)[27, 28].

Finally, these results enable us to construct a temperature-pressure (\(T\)-\(P\)) phase diagram for Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\) shown in Fig. 3, which depicts explicitly the evolution of the cubic-to-tetragonal structural transition at \(T_{\rm c}\) and the superconducting transition \(T_{\rm c}\) as a function of pressure. It becomes clear that the tetragonal phase is destabilized by pressure, and the cubic phase remains stable down to the lowest temperature at \(P\geqslant 12\) GPa. There is a two-phase coexistent region around \(10\pm 2\) GPa, signaling a first-order character of this pressured-induced phase transition. Within the tetragonal phase at \(P<P_{\rm c}\), the external pressure enhances \(T_{\rm c}\) with a concomitant suppression of \(T_{\rm s}\), which suggests a competing nature of these two transitions reminiscent of the quantum criticality observed in several unconventional superconductors [1]. The high-pressure cubic phase is also superconducting with higher \(T_{\rm c}\approx 6\) K, which decreases slightly with further increasing pressure. There is a discontinuous jump of \(T_{\rm c}\) from the tetragonal to cubic phases.

Previous studies at ambient pressure have revealed that the cubic-to-tetragonal structural transition at \(T_{\rm s}\) is accompanied with a spin-gap opening [15, 19, 20, 21, 22], which is most likely associated with the Mo-Mo spin-singlet states formed only along the \(c\) axis because the NN Mo-Mo bond is about 0.3% shorter than those within the \(ab\) plane in the tetragonal phase, as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). Then the formation of spin-singlet states will produce a gap over part of the Fermi surface (FS) and leave the remaining Mo \(4d\) electrons within the \(ab\) plane forming the FS responsible for the observed superconductivity below \(T_{\rm c}\). By suppressing the spin-singlet states, the application of external pressure restores the missing region of FS and thus increases the density of states (DOS) at Fermi energy available for superconductivity, which could result in the enhancement of \(T_{\rm c}\). Such a scenario of competition for states at the Fermi energy can be further verified by the Bilbro-McMillan equation [29], viz. \(T_{\rm c}\,^{*}T_{\rm s}\,^{1-n}=T_{\rm 0}\), where \(n\) is the portion of electronic DOS at the Fermi energy forming the superconducting gap, and \(T_{\rm c0}\) is the superconducting transition temperature without high-temperature transition at \(T_{\rm s}\). This relationship was initially developed to account for the competition of superconductivity with the Peierls-like structural transition in A-15 superconductors like V\({}_{3}\)Si and Nb\({}_{3}\)Sn [29] and was later found to be also applicable in the Chevrel-phase superconductor Eu\({}_{4}\)Mo\({}_{6}\)S\({}_{8}\)[30] and the heavy-fermion superconductor CeRhIn\({}_{5}\)[31], involving the competition of superconductivity with charge-density-wave and antiferromagnetic transitions, respectively.

To estimate the value of \(n\) as a function of pressure, we resorted to the upper critical field \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(T)\), whose initial slope \(\eta=-\mu_{0}H_{c2}(T)\), where \(\mu_{0}\)=\(-\mu_{0}H_{c2}/dT|_{T_{\rm c}}\) is proportional to the electronic specific-heat coefficient \(\gamma\) and thus \(N(E_{F})\) via the relationship: \(\eta=4.48\)\(\gamma\rho_{0}\) (T/K) in the dirty limit of BCS superconductors [32]. Such a BCS-type relationship has been used successfully to reproduce the experimental value of \(\eta=1.25\) T/K for Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\) at ambient pressure [12], even though it remains controversial regarding the exact pairing symmetry of superconductivity [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Figures 4(a)-4(d) show the low-temperature \(\rho(T)\) of sample #3 under different magnetic fields and pressures. As can be seen, \(T_{\rm c}\) shifts down to lower temperatures with increasing magnetic fields. Here, we defined \(T_{\rm c}\) as the middle point between 10 and 90% drop of resistivity and plotted the upper critical field \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}\) as a function of \(T_{\rm c}\) in Fig. 4(e). The initial slope \(\eta\) values are readily obtained from the linear fitting to \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(T_{\rm c})\), while extrapolations to \(T=0\) allow us to estimate the zero-temperature upper critical fields \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)\) as 4.0, 5.1, 6.1, 8.9, 8.7, and 8.5 T for \(P=3.5\), 6, 8.5, 12, 14, and 15 GPa, respectively. It is also noteworthy that Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\) exhibits a relatively large magnetoresistance MR[\(\equiv\rho(H)/\rho(0)-1]>20\)% in the normal state just above \(T_{\rm c}\) for \(P<P_{\rm c}\), whereas the MR becomes negligible for \(P>P_{\rm c}\). Further studies are needed to clarify why the relatively large MR is observed in the tetragonal phase.

As shown in Fig. 5, \(\eta\) increases quickly from 1.25 T/K at ambient pressure to 1.52 T/K at 8.5 GPa within the tetragonal phase, which indicates that \(N(E_{\rm f})\) increases with pressure. On the other hand, \(\eta\) changes slightly in the cubic phase at

Figure 3: Temperature-pressure phase diagram of Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\). The circle, square, and triangle symbols represent the transition temperatures for samples #1, #2, and #3, respectively. The solid black curve denotes the calculated \(T_{\rm c}\)\({}^{\rm calc}\) according to the Bilbro-McMillan equation, i.e. \(T_{\rm c}\,^{n}T_{\rm s}\,^{1-n}=T_{\rm c0}\), as detailed in the main text. Note that both the experimental \(T_{\rm c}\) and \(T_{\rm c}\)\({}^{\rm calc}\) have been scaled by a factor of two.

  \(P>10\) GPa. Finally, we obtained \(n\equiv\eta/\eta_{12\text{ GPa}}\) given that the structural transition disappears at 12 GPa. This leads to an \(n=0.8\) at ambient pressure, which indicates that about 20% of the DOS at the Fermi energy is removed below \(T_{\text{s}}\) due to the formation of spin-singlet states. From the pressure dependence of \(n\) and \(T_{\text{s}}\), we can calculate the pressure dependence of \(T_{\text{c}}\) according to the above Bilbro-McMillan equation [29], i.e. \(T_{\text{c}}^{\text{calc}}=T_{\text{c}0}^{1/n}\cdot T_{\text{s}}^{1-(1/n)}\). As shown by the solid curve in Fig. 3, the experimental \(T_{\text{c}}\) can be well reproduced by assuming a \(T_{\text{c}0}=4.4\) K, which corresponds to an upper limit of \(T_{\text{c}}\) without the high-temperature structural transition. However, this value is lower than the observed \(T_{\text{c}}\approx 6\) K for the high-pressure cubic phase. This fact is reflected as a jump rather than a smooth change of \(T_{\text{c}}\) near the tetragonal-cubic phase boundary in the \(T\)-\(P\) phase diagram in Fig. 3, presumably due to the reinforced electron-phonon coupling in the higher symmetry cubic phase as well as the enhanced spin fluctuations as indicated by the non-Fermi-liquid \(\rho\sim T^{1.5}\) behavior mentioned above.

We have performed first-principles calculations to further substantiate our experimental findings in this paper. First, our calculations were performed by using the experimental lattice parameters with internal coordinates relaxed until internal forces were less than 2 mRyd/a.u. In this case, the resultant DOS at Fermi level \(N(E_{\text{F}})\) was found to decrease with increasing pressure. This is consistent with the general expectation of pressure decreasing interatomic distances, increasing atomic wave function overlap, thereby causing higher bandwidth and lowering average values of \(N(E_{\text{F}})\). In these calculations, the pressure was introduced by using the experimental lattice parameters.

We found that the \(N(E_{\text{F}})\) values (per Rydberg for both spins) of the tetragonal phase at ambient pressure, 4, and 8 GPa are 281.0, 256.6, 251.9, respectively, and is further reduced to 242.4 at 12 GPa in the cubic phase. This theoretical reduction of \(N(E_{\text{F}})\) with pressure therefore cannot provide an immediate explanation for the experimentally observed enhancement of \(T_{\text{c}}\), which we partially attribute to an increase of \(N(E_{\text{F}})\). To resolve this discrepancy, we have carefully investigated the possible magnetic behavior, which would likely tend to compete with the superconductivity and could also transfer DOS spectral weight away from the Fermi level, thus affecting the observed \(N(E_{\text{F}})\).

In the relaxed structures, we find no evidence of magnetism, with all spin-polarized calculations converging to a result identical to the non-spin-polarized calculations. This is consistent with the lack of magnetism in the tetragonal state, i.e. a temperature-independent magnetic susceptibility below 20 K [2] and the absence of muon spin precession down to 5 K [15]. However, if the experimental internal coordinates are used in the tetragonal state at ambient pressure, we find a ferromagnetic ground state, albeit with small moments (0.025 \(\mu_{\text{B}}\) per Mo for the fourfold site and 0.073 \(\mu_{\text{B}}\) per Mo

These data were used to obtain the upper critical fields \(\mu_{0}H_{c.2}\) shown in (e), where a linear fitting has been used to extract the values of initial slope \(-dH_{c.2}/dT|_{T_{\text{c}}}\).

Figure 5: Pressure dependence of the initial slope of upper critical field \(\eta=-dH_{c.2}/dT|_{T_{\text{c}}}\). Since \(\eta\) is proportional to electronic specific-heat coefficient \(\gamma\) and thus the DOS at Fermi level \(N(E_{\text{F}})\), we employed the obtained \(\eta\) values below 10 GPa to estimate the portion of electronic states forming the FS \(n\equiv\eta/\eta_{12\text{ GPa}}\) as shown in the inset. Here, we assume all electronic states at 12 GPa participate in the formation of FS since the spin-singlet states vanish at this pressure.

  for the twofold site). A similar situation, i.e. the sensitivity of magnetism to small structural changes, is known in parents of the Fe-based superconductors, as found previously by Subedi _et al._[33] for the iron chalcogenide FeTe, although in that case, antiferromagnetism was found for the unrelaxed structure.

Here, we find that the nonmagnetic \(N(E_{\rm F})\) in this unrelaxed tetragonal state 335.6/Ryd-u.c. is some 20% higher than that in the relaxed state, and the Mo-site-projected \(N(E_{\rm F})\) for the twofold Mo site 35.64/Mo-Ryd is much larger than the relaxed value of 21.53. These large \(N(E_{\rm F})\) values therefore lead, via the Stoner criterion, to a substantially increased tendency towards ferromagnetism. Calculations initialized in a Mo-Mo nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic configuration also converged to this ferromagnetic state. We now combine this ferromagnetic result with previous theoretical work [34] showing a small magnetic moment configuration to be energetically degenerate with a nonmagnetic state. It is certainly possible, though clearly unproven here, that there is a weak ferromagnetic behavior at ambient pressure. This would tend to compete with the superconductivity, since a spin-singlet superconductivity in general does not coexist with ferromagnetism.

In addition to the possible ferromagnetism inferred from our calculations, there is also the possibility of nesting-based magnetism, which could also compete with the superconductivity. In Fig. 6, we depict the band 291 FS, which from inspection could support a nesting-induced spin-density wave between the parallel faces at the zone corners. Since this FS accounts, from our calculations, for approximately 15% of \(N(E_{E})\), its gapping [reducing \(N(E_{\rm F})\)] at ambient pressure, and then lack of gapping [thereby increasing \(N(E_{\rm F})\)] as pressure is applied, could yield an increase in the specific heat coefficient with pressure, as we observe experimentally.

These two types of magnetic behavior present possibilities for explaining the observed enhancement of \(T_{\rm c}\) with pressure. It is also possible that there are significant changes in the phonon spectrum, and ultimately electron-phonon coupling \(\lambda\) with pressure, that affect \(T_{\rm c}\). These would need to be rather significant, given the observed increase in \(T_{\rm c}\) from 2.3 K at ambient pressure to \(\sim\)6 K at 12 GPa. Using the McMillan [35] equation, this \(T_{\rm c}\) increase would require an approximate 35% increase in \(\lambda\) (from 0.55 to 0.74), assuming a pressure-independent Debye temperature.

## IV Conclusion

In summary, we have performed a comprehensive high-pressure study on the resistivity of Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\) and mapped out the pressure dependence of the cubic-to-tetragonal structural transition and the superconductivity transition up to 15 GPa. Below 10 GPa, pressure suppresses \(T_{\rm s}\) but enhances \(T_{\rm c}\). A pressure-induced first-order transition takes place in the pressure range 8-12 GPa, above which the cubic phase is stable in the whole temperature range. The high-pressure cubic phase is also a superconductor with higher \(T_{\rm c}\approx\) 6 K but shows a negative pressure dependence. Our results demonstrated unambiguously a competitive nature between superconductivity and the structural transition within the tetragonal phase; the lower \(T_{\rm c}\) in the tetragonal phase at ambient pressure arises from the competition with the spin-gap formation. Our first-principles calculations suggest that magnetism should be considered to account for the observed pressure dependence of superconductivity and it may compete with the superconductivity in Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\). This work further illustrates the close interplay between superconductivity, magnetism, and structural instability in Mo\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{7}\).
