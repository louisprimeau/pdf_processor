###### Abstract

We report on specific-heat measurements under a magnetic field on oriented single crystals of the nonconventional superconductors PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) and PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) with superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\)\(\sim\) 18 and 9 K, respectively. In the superconducting state, the electronic specific heat follows a quadratic temperature dependence, which indicates an axial state with line nodes in the superconducting gap structure. The specific heat measured under a magnetic field applied along different crystallographic directions reveals anisotropic behavior. For both compounds, \(T_{c}\) decreases faster for fields applied along the \(c\) axis than for fields perpendicular to it. The value of the slope of the critical field at \(T_{c}\) is higher in the case of PuCoGa\({}_{5}\), while the anisotropy effect is stronger in PuRhGa\({}_{5}\). Further results are discussed in the context of the isostructural Ce- and Np-based materials. The possibility of the appearance of a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state and/or strong spin-orbit coupling, related to the observed low-temperature linear shape of the critical field deviating from the common \(d\)-wave superconductor behavior, is considered, especially in the PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) case.

## I Introduction

The actinide-based _AT_Ga\({}_{5}\) (_A_ = actinide, \(T\) = transition metal) intermetallic compounds have attracted much interest since the discovery of superconductivity in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) (Ref. [1]) and PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) (Ref. [2]) with critical temperatures one order of magnitude higher than the maximum seen in U- and Ce-based heavy-fermion systems up to now. These _AT_Ga\({}_{5}\) materials crystallize in the tetragonal HoCoGa\({}_{5}\)-type structure with the space group \(P\)4/_mmm_. PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) is a superconductor displaying a remarkably high critical temperature \(T_{c}\)=18.5 K and upper critical field \(H_{c2}(0)\) estimated at \(\sim\)74 T.1 PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) has lower critical parameters, \(T_{c}\)=8.7 K and \(H_{c2}(0)\)\(\sim\) 21 T.2 Both materials appear to be close to a magnetic phase instability [3, 4] and to display unconventional superconductivity as recently suggested by NMR studies [5, 6]. The magnetic susceptibility of both compounds in the normal state indicates local-moment (Curie-Weiss) behavior close to that expected for Pu3+.

The uranium isostructural materials U_T_Ga\({}_{5}\) are nonsuperconducting paramagnets for \(T\) from the iron and cobalt column, but order antiferromagnetically for \(T\) from the nickel column [7, 8, 9]. Among the Np-based compounds, NpCoGa\({}_{5}\), NpRhGa\({}_{5}\), NpFeGa\({}_{5}\), and NpNiGa\({}_{5}\) have been investigated so far and they all exhibit antiferromagnetic order [10, 11, 12]. Recent studies on the Pu(Co,Rh)Ga\({}_{5}\) and other substituted _AT_Ga\({}_{5}\) compounds [13, 14] revealed a correlation between the \(c/a\) ratio and \(T_{c}\) in analogy to the Ce_M_In\({}_{5}\) (_M_ = Co, Rh,Ir) heavy-fermion \(d\)-wave superconductors [15], pointing to a similarity of the superconducting mechanism in both Pu- and Ce-based 115 materials. Unconventional superconductivity is corroborated by the absence of superconductivity in isostructural compounds with U, Np, or a rare earth other than Ce. Moreover, Pu substitution by nonmagnetic U or magnetic Np leads to comparably strong suppression of superconductivity [14].

An important contribution to the understanding of the electronic properties of these materials is obtained from the specific-heat data. Results can be compared with parameters obtained by other techniques, such as magnetization and resistivity, especially in the case of substitution of the transition metals (Co\(-\)Rh). Moreover, this technique allows one to access important information, such as an estimation of the density of states at the Fermi level, and to categorize the materials in the superconductor family. It is a bulk measurement indicating the quality of the superconductivity.

In this paper, we present results for the specific heat of PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) and PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) single crystals measured in magnetic fields up to 9 T. For clarity and coherency of the data presented, we include also some previously reported experimental data that were repeated on new samples. However, the present work focuses on two major additional results. First, the low-temperature specific heat in the superconducting state of PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) down to 3 K is presented (previous measurements were limited to 7 K, i.e., to only a short range below \(T_{c}\)). The extended range of measurements allows evidencing the \(T^{2}\) power law of the electronic specific heat in the superconducting state of PuRhGa\({}_{5}\), like that observed for PuCoGa\({}_{5}\)[13]. Additionally, comparison of the specific heats of PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) and PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) with those of their uranium analogs in a wide temperature range up to 100 K allows us to estimate the \(\gamma\) value of the electronic specific heat. The second major result is the observation of the anisotropic response of both PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) and PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) versus an applied magnetic field. Contrary to previously reported specific-heat data (for PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) only) [16], our present results provide clear evidence of the anisotropy in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\). The anisotropy in PuRhGa\({}_{5}\), so far observed only by magnetization measurements [17], is now confirmed by another technique and on another sample. Finally, the temperature dependence of the critical fields and the Maki parameter were determined, and a possible Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state in these compounds is discussed.

  

## II Experiment

Polycrystals and large single crystals of PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) and PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) were synthesized. The single crystals were grown by a Ga flux method. Polycrystalline ingots were prepared by arc-melting stoichiometric amounts of the constituent elements under an atmosphere of high-purity argon on a water-cooled copper hearth, using a Zr getter. To ensure homogeneity, the arc-melted buttons were turned over and remelted three times. Weight losses were checked during the synthesis process and found to be negligibly small. The pellets were annealed at 750 \({}^{\circ}\)C for one week under high vacuum. The crystal structure and the purity of the polycrystalline samples obtained were then checked from x-ray powder diffraction data (Cu \(K\alpha\) radiation) collected on a Bragg-Brentano Siemens D500 diffractometer. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction data were collected on an Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 four-circle diffractometer employing monochromated Mo \(K\alpha\) radiation. The data processing was carried out using the MOLEN package.[18]

The specific heat was measured by the relaxation method on a PPMS-9 system (Quantum Design). For PuCoGa\({}_{5}\), we measured a 30 mg polycrystalline sample and a 1.4 mg single crystal. For PuRhGa\({}_{5}\), we examined a 20 mg polycrystalline sample above 6 K (the lowest temperature was limited by self-heating effects) and two small single crystals (1.2 and 0.8 mg) measured down to 3.3 K. The large polycrystalline samples were measured to achieve satisfactory precision at higher temperatures. All the samples were measured in magnetic fields up to 9 T with different orientations with respect to the crystallographic axes. The results on both PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) single crystals were identical within the experimental errors: we report data for the larger one.

The self-heating, mainly due to the \({}^{239}\)Pu, (i) limits the lowest achievable temperatures and (ii) causes the different parts of the measured system (sample, platform with thermometer, wires) to be at different temperatures. These differences increase with decreasing thermal conductivity of the wires at low temperatures. The standard data acquisition and analysis software does not take this effect into account, but measured data can be corrected for these errors.[19] In our case, the samples measured at low temperatures were relatively small and well thermally coupled to the platform, reducing the corrections to less than 0.5% of the total \(C_{p}\) value. The data presented include these corrections although the corrections do not have any significant influence.

## III Results

The specific heat of PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) measured in zero field shows a clear anomaly at \(T_{c}\)=17.8 K (Fig. 1). The \(T_{c}\) value is slightly lower than the originally reported value of \(T_{c}\)=18.5 K,[1] presumably due to aging effects. The \(C_{p}\)(\(T\)) data measured on both the single-crystal and polycrystalline samples are almost identical and are in good agreement with results published previously.[1, 13] The specific heat of PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) and URhGa\({}_{5}\) is shown in Fig. 1 up to 100 K and in Fig. 2 with focus on the low-temperature part. The transition to the superconducting state is accompanied by a well-pronounced anomaly at \(T_{c}\)= 9 K.

As URhGa\({}_{5}\) does not order magnetically, its specific heat consists of the lattice and electronic contributions only. At low temperatures (below 8 K), the lattice part follows a \(T^{3}\) power law and the specific heat can be described by the simple formula

\[C_{p}=C_{lan}+C_{el}=\beta T^{3}+\gamma T.\] (1)

The fit to experimental data below 8 K allows us to extract the value of the Sommerfeld coefficient \(\gamma\)=13\(\pm\)1 mJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\) (somewhat higher than the 7 mJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\) reported for a URhGa\({}_{5}\) single crystal[20]) and the Debye temperature \(\Theta_{D}\)=184 K, assuming that it describes three acoustic phonon branches.

In a first approximation, we take the lattice specific heat of URhGa\({}_{5}\) as an estimation of this contribution also in PuRhGa\({}_{5}\). The electronic contribution in PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) is then calculated as

\[C_{el}=C_{\rm Pu}-C_{latt}=C_{\rm Pu}-C_{\rm U}+\gamma_{\rm U}T\] (2)

and its low-temperature part is shown in the inset of Fig. 2. In the superconducting phase (i.e., below \(T_{c}\)), it can be well described by the power-law formula

Figure 2: Low-temperature specific heat of PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) single crystal and URhGa\({}_{5}\). Inset shows \(C_{el}/T\) of PuRhGa\({}_{5}\); the line is a fit to Eq. (3).

Figure 1: (Color online) Specific heat of PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) (\(\triangle\)), UCoGa\({}_{5}\) (\(\Diamond\) , taken from Ref. [10]), PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) (\(\Circle\)), and URhGa\({}_{5}\) (\(\square\)). Data for \(A\)CoGa\({}_{5}\)(\(A\)= U, Pu) are shifted upward by 0.4 mJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\) to avoid overlap with ARRhGa\({}_{5}\) data. The lines correspond to a shift of \(C_{p}/T\) of the uranium analog to get the \(\gamma\) value of 130 mJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\) in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) (dash-dotted line), 150 mJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\) in PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) (full line), and 80 mJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\) in PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) (dashed line), respectively. Inset shows the low-temperature \(C_{p}/T\) vs \(T^{2}\) plot for URhGa\({}_{5}\).

 \[C_{el} = aT^{2} + \gamma_{0}T\] (3)

with \(a = 13.8\) mJ mol-1 K-3 and \(\gamma_{0}\) close to zero (0 +- 1 mJ mol-1 K-2) as seen from Fig. 2.

The normalized specific heat jump at \(T_{c}\), \(\Delta C_{el}/T = 45 \pm 5\) mJ mol-1 K-2, obtained for the three studied samples, is about three times smaller than that in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\).[1, 13] Using the BCS relation \(\Delta C_{el}/\gamma T_{c} = 1.43\), it yields a Sommerfeld \(\gamma\) coefficient \(\approx\)30 mJ mol-1 K-2. Roughly the same \(\gamma\) value is extracted when applying Eq. (1) to the temperature region 9-12 K (i.e., just above \(T_{c}\)). However, this application is not valid in this case, as demonstrated in Fig. 3 for URhGa\({}_{5}\) data. The full line here corresponds to the correct application of (1) at \(T \ll \Theta_{D}\) (see above), whereas the extrapolation from higher temperatures above 9 K clearly follows a different slope and leads to wrong values of \(\gamma\) and \(\Theta_{D}\). The phonon spectrum is, in this particular case, too complex to describe its specific heat by the simple \(T^{3}\) law above \(\sim\)8 K.

Considerably higher \(\gamma\) values are derived when comparing URhGa\({}_{5}\) and PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) data above the critical temperature: the value of \(\gamma\) is estimated between \(\approx\)80 and 150 mJ mol-1 K-2 (dashed and full line, respectively, in Fig. 1). The assumption of the same lattice contribution in Pu and U compounds is only a first approximation, but possible differences in the phonon spectra should not play a significant role when comparing URhGa\({}_{5}\) and PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) at low temperatures around \(T_{c}\), where the lattice part is only a minor contribution in PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) (see Fig. 2). The value of \(\gamma\) \(\approx\) 80 mJ mol-1 K-2 inferred from our data just above \(T_{c}\) can thus be taken as a lower limit for \(\gamma\) estimation in the nonsuperconducting phase, more than twice higher than the value derived from experimental \(\Delta C_{el}/T_{c}\) and the BCS relation.

Analogous analysis for PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) and UCoGa\({}_{5}\) (see Fig. 1) shows that UCoGa\({}_{5}\) gives a rather good estimation of the lattice specific heat in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) (as well as in NpCoGa\({}_{5}\)),[11] and we infer a value of \(\gamma\) \(\approx\) 130 mJ mol-1 K-2 in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) (dash-dotted line in Fig. 1), which is finally surprisingly close to that (\(\approx\)95 mJ mol-1 K-2) derived from the BCS relation.[1, 13]

The effect of an applied field on the specific heats of PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) and PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) is demonstrated in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. In both compounds, the results obtained for \(H\) along the \(a\) and \(b\) axes are almost identical, as expected. We show only one set of curves and denote \(H\perp c\). The very high slope at \(T_{c}\) is determined in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\): \(A_{0}dH_{c2}/dT|_{Tc}\) \(\cong\) -8 and -10 T/K for \(H\) parallel to \(c\) and perpendicular to it, respectively (see Fig. 6). In the case of PuRhGa\({}_{5}\), the critical temperature decreases with increasing field much faster. The inferred temperature dependencies of the critical field are represented in Fig. 6. We plot here also data derived from magnetization measurements by Haga _et al.[17]_ In

Figure 4: (Color online) Specific heat of PuCoGa\({}_{5}\), (b) Single crystal with \(H\|c\) (circles) and \(H\perp c\) (triangles), and (a) polycrystal, shifted upward by 0.2 J mol-1 K−2 to avoid overlapping.

Figure 5: (Color online) Specific heat of PuRhGa\({}_{5}\). (a) Polycrystal; and the single crystal with (b) \(H\perp c\) and (c) \(H\|c\). The individual sets of curves are shifted upward by 0.08 J mol−1 K−2 to avoid overlapping. The applied fields in (b) and (c) are identical. The critical temperature is slightly higher for the polycrystalline sample than for the single crystal, essentially due to self-irradiation damage (Ref. 21), as the single crystal was measured with one month aging, whereas the polycrystalline sample was measured with only three days aging.

Figure 3: \(C_{p}/T\) vs \(T^{2}\) plot for PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) and URhGa\({}_{5}\) at low temperatures; the solid line is a linear fit to URhGa\({}_{5}\) data below 8 K (as in Fig. 1) where the simplification of the lattice specific heat to the \(T^{3}\) power law (1) is correct, whereas the dashed lines representing linear extrapolation from the \(T^{2}\) region between 80 and 150 K−2 (i.e., above \(T_{c}\) of PuRhGa\({}_{5}\)) give clearly different slopes and would lead to wrong Debye temperatures and \(\gamma\) values.

  PuRhGa\({}_{5}\), we find approximately an initial slope of \(\mu_{\varphi}dH_{c2}/dT|_{Tc}\)  = -2.0 and -4.0 T/K for the field applied along \(c\) and perpendicular to it, respectively.

## IV Discussion

The Pu-based 115 compounds are naturally compared with the Ce\(T\)In\({}_{5}\) superconductors. Several analogies, including the correlation of \(T_{c}\) with \(c/a\), point to similar underlying physics in both groups of materials.[13] We find now another similarity when inspecting the electronic specific heat below \(T_{c}\). The \(T^{2}\) power law in the specific heat below \(T_{c}\) seems to be a common behavior in all these compounds--it is also found at low temperatures in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\),[1, 13] and in isostructural Ce superconductors CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) under pressure,[22] CeCoIn\({}_{5}\), and CeIrIn\({}_{5}\).[23] Such a \(T^{2}\) dependence indicates an axial state with line nodes in the superconducting gap structure, as in many unconventional \(d\)-wave superconductors, including YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{6.95}\),[24] La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\),[25] or UPd\({}_{2}\)Al\({}_{3}\).[26] Our present PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) study reveals the \(T^{4}\) dependence in a broad temperature region between the low-temperature limit of 3.3 K and up to the critical temperature. The fact that \(C_{p}/T\)\(\sim\)\(T\) for 0.4 \(<\)\(T/T_{c}\)\(<\) 1 is rather unusual. More often the power law behavior is seen below \(\sim\)0.5\(T_{c}\) only. The former \(C_{p}\) data on PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) showed the \(T^{2}\) dependence of \(C_{\varphi}\) in the limited temperature range from 5.2 up to 7.2 K only[13] (the lower limit due to self-heating). In CeCoIn\({}_{5}\) also the power law occurs at lower \(T/T_{c}\).[13] We have no clear explanation at this moment as to why PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) is an exception, showing the \(C_{p}/T\)\(\sim\)\(T\) behavior up to \(T_{c}\). The conclusion about the line nodes in the superconducting gap in PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) is furthermore corroborated by a recent nuclear quadrupole resonance study.[6]

The value of the coefficient \(a\)  = 14 mJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-3}\) in formula (3) is higher than the value of 5 mJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-3}\) found in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\), but still one order of magnitude lower than values observed in Ce\(T\)In\({}_{5}\) heavy-fermion superconductors (\(a\) = 0.25 and 3.6 J mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-3}\) in CeCoIn\({}_{5}\) and CeIrIn\({}_{5}\), respectively).[22, 23] The \(\gamma_{0}\)  \(\approx\) 0 below \(T_{c}\) obtained in our case reveals that the Fermi surface is fully gapped (except for the line nodes) and the superconductivity is bulk and complete.

The gradual enhancement of \(C_{p}/T\) seen in PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) at the lowest measured temperatures when increasing the magnetic field (Fig. 5) might be due to an increase of the linear term in (3) by a certain value \(\gamma(H)\), indicating a field dependence of the density of states at the Fermi level. The lower temperature limit of our measurement does not allow any further quantitative analysis that could be compared with theoretical predictions as discussed, e.g., for YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{6.95}\).[24]

The \(\gamma\) value in the normal state of PuRhGa\({}_{5}\), although estimated with higher uncertainty, is comparable to that of PuCoGa\({}_{5}\). The twice lower critical temperature in PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) could be due to a weaker pairing potential, which might depend on the \(c/a\) ratio.[4] The strong sensitivity of \(T_{c}\) to the \(c/a\) ratio with almost unchanged \(\gamma\) coefficient when substituting Co or Pu corroborates this assumption.[14]

The decrease of \(T_{c}\) when applying a magnetic field is stronger for PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) than for PuCoGa\({}_{5}\). It corresponds well to the different upper critical field \(H_{c2}\) in both compounds as inferred from the resistivity data.[1, 2] The extracted value of \(\mu_{\varphi}dH_{c2}/dT|_{Tc}\) in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) is practically the same as the one reported in previous work.[16] More interesting is the anisotropy of the field influence on \(T_{c}\). It is clearly observed in PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) that \(T_{c}\) is suppressed approximately twice faster if the magnetic field is applied along the tetragonal \(c\) axis rather than perpendicular to it. Our observation is corroborated also by recent magnetization measurements,[17] which reveal the slope of \(-dH_{c2}/dT\)=2.0 and 3.5 T/K for \(H\)\(\parallel\)\(c\) and \(H\)\(\parallel\)\(a\), respectively, well comparable with our values. A similar size of the \(T_{c}\) suppression for \(H\)\(\parallel\)\(c\) is inferred also from NMR measurements:[6]\(T_{c}\) decreases to \(\sim\)4 K in 11 T. The same tendency for anisotropy is found in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\), although the anisotropy here is lower and less evident, as the maximum available field extends our PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) data to \(T_{c}(H)/T_{c}(0)\) \(\sim\) 0.93 only. The observed anisotropy is another strong analogy to the Ce-based isostructural superconductors CeCoIn\({}_{5}\) and CeIrIn\({}_{5}\).[27] The anisotropy of \(H_{c2}\) is here well explained by the anisotropic effective mass, reflecting a quasi-two-dimensional ellipsoidal Fermi surface. Our measurements, in agreement with magnetization data,[17] would imply an ellipsoidal Fermi surface with the main axis ratio \(k_{c}/k_{a}\)  \(\approx\) 2.0 in PuRhGa\({}_{5}\), slightly lower than in CeTIn\({}_{5}\) compounds. The anisotropy of \(dH_{c2}/dT\) as inferred from our data is considerably lower in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\), implying roughly \(k_{c}/k_{a}\)\(\approx\) 1.3. This value should be taken with care as the data are limited to \(T_{c}(H)/T_{c}(0)\) \(\sim\) 0.93, and may differ in higher fields.

It is worth stressing that two different techniques (specific heat and magnetization[17]) applied on different samples both show exactly the same unusual behavior of the PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) upper critical field \(H_{c2}(T)\), confirming this intrinsic behavior of the material. This deviation of \(H_{c2}(T)\) from saturation when approaching 0 K is commonly observed in \(d\)-wave superconductors[28, 29] such as the related compound

Figure 6: Critical field \(\mu_{\varphi}dH_{c2}(T)\) determined by specific heat in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) and PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) for field applied along the \(c\) axis (open circles) and the \(a\) axis (filled circles); the dashed lines are to guide the eye; the triangles represent data derived from magnetization measurements (Ref. [17]). Due to the very high slope at \(T_{c}\) in these materials, very high fields are required to restore the normal state (\(\mu_{\varphi}dH\) \(>\) 10 T). In the case of PuRhGa\({}_{5}\), we observe a linear variation of the upper critical field down to \(T/T_{c}\)\(\sim\) 0.5 for \(H\)\(\parallel\)\(c\). Magnetization measurements (Ref. [17]) indicate that this regime is present also for \(H\)\(\parallel\)\(a\) in the same temperature range, and is even maintained down to \(T/T_{c}\)\(\sim\) 0.1 for \(H\)\(\parallel\)\(c\) (\(\mu_{\varphi}dH\) = 14 T).

  CeCoIn\({}_{5}\)[30], which develops a FFLO (Refs. [31] and [32]) state.[33, 34] This state can in principle occur only in \(d\)-wave superconductors in the clean limit for strongly Pauli-limited systems with a high Maki parameter and presenting low or reduced dimensionality (one or two dimensions). The possibility of such behavior in Pu\(T\)Ga\({}_{5}\) (\(T\)=Co, Rh) systems is discussed below.

The Pauli-limited critical field[35] can be inferred from

\[\mu_{0}H_{p}(0)=1.84T_{c},\] (4)

whereas the orbital-limited critical field,[36] the Maki parameter,[37] and the combined orbital and paramagnetic limited critical field[38] can be inferred from the initial \(dH_{c2}/dT\) slope by

\[\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{*}(0)=-0.693T_{c}(\mu_{0}dH_{c2}/dT)_{T=T_{c}},\] (5)

\[\alpha=-0.528(\mu_{0}dH_{c2}/dT)_{T=T_{c}},\] (6)

and

\[H_{c2}^{**}(0)=H_{c2}^{*}(0)(1+\alpha^{2})^{-1/2},\] (7)

respectively. The values obtained for PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) and PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) in different directions are listed in Table 1. For both compounds, the anisotropy of the \((\mu_{0}dH_{c2}/dT)_{T=T_{c}}\) slope is reflected in the \(H_{c2}^{*}\) field. The values obtained for the Maki parameter and the \(d\)-wave character previously reported[5, 6] would qualify both compounds for a possible FFLO phase. However, several considerations have to be taken into account. First, the true value of the upper critical field at 0 K of PuCoGa\({}_{5}\), in both the Pauli and orbital limits (33 T and, depending on the orientation, 98/123 T, respectively) are experimentally inaccessible. Nonetheless, Table 1 shows that PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) is probably controlled by the orbital limit, which should prevent the occurrence of a FFLO state in this compound. Only future measurements in very high fields (\(\mu_{0}H\)\(>\) 30 T) could confirm or refute this assumption. Second, the FFLO state is in principle very sensitive to (suppressed by) impurities, which would make it difficult to observe in a plutonium-based system where the self-decay of \({}^{239}\)Pu permanently creates defects. This phenomenon is more pronounced in PuRhGa\({}_{5}\), which rapidly becomes a dirty superconductor.[21] Nevertheless, the Rh compound would present a more favorable configuration for the magnetic field applied along the \(c\) axis, where the paramagnetic limit plays a role, and the weak negative curvature of the critical field for \(H\) perpendicular to the \(c\) axis could be ascribed to the beginning of a FFLO effect (which would then occur around 0.55\(T_{c}\), as theoretically predicted). However, such an assumption remains very speculative for the reasons discussed above, and also because we do not see any evolution from second- to first-order character of the superconducting transition in the specific heat, which should occur in the vicinity of the FFLO state.[39]

Another reason for the linear regime at low temperature of \(H_{c2}(T)\) could be the possibility of a strong electron-phonon coupling effect, implying phonon modes at low energies. This phenomenon, commonly observed for BCS-like superconductors, has also been revealed for some unconventional superconductors.[40, 41] The main consequence of this strong coupling is an enhanced critical field at low temperatures, which is more or less what we observe, especially in PuRhGa\({}_{5}\). Recent predictions[42] and measurements[43] achieved on PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) by synchrotron radiation would point to this possibility. Nevertheless, none of these has been performed yet on PuRhGa\({}_{5}\), and we can only assume a similar behavior between these two systems.

Finally, the revealed anisotropy of the superconductivity suppression in Pu\(T\)Ga\({}_{5}\) is very comparable to the magnetic anisotropy observed in the isostructural Np-based compounds. The antiferromagnetic order in both NpCoGa\({}_{5}\) (Ref. [44]) and NpRhGa\({}_{5}\) (Ref. [45]) is suppressed more rapidly for \(H\) parallel to \(c\) than perpendicular to it. It is tempting to conclude that there is a correlation between the magnetic and superconducting properties of both the Pu\(T\)Ga\({}_{5}\) and Np\(T\)Ga\({}_{5}\) series. Indeed, band-structure calculations predict that antiferromagnetic interactions can be expected to be present in Pu\(T\)Ga\({}_{5}\) and that antiferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuations play a role in Cooper pair formation.[4] The suppression of superconductivity could then be related to the suppression of these AF fluctuations.

## V Conclusions

PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) and PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) undergo a transition to the superconducting state at \(T_{c}\)\(\sim\) 18 and 9 K, respectively, the critical temperature depending also on sample aging. The electronic specific heat below \(T_{c}\) follows a quadratic temperature dependence that indicates an axial state with line nodes in the superconducting gap structure. The Sommerfeld coefficient \(\gamma\) is estimated in PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) between 80 and 150 mJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\) from \(C_{p}(T)\) data above \(T_{c}\). The reduction of \(T_{c}\) under applied external magnetic field is faster in PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) than in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) and anisotropic in both compounds. The anisotropy is larger for PuRhGa\({}_{5}\), where the suppression of \(T_{c}\) is twice stronger for the field applied along the \(c\) axis than perpendicular to it. In PuCoGa\({}_{5}\), we notice that for both directions the orbital-limited critical field \(H_{c2}^{*}\) is much higher than the Pauli

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c}  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{PuCoGa\({}_{5}\)} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{PuRhGa\({}_{5}\)} \\  & \(H\)\(\parallel\)\(c\) & \(H\)\(\perp\)\(c\) & \(H\)\(\parallel\)\(c\) & \(H\)\(\perp\)\(c\) \\ \hline \(T_{c}\) (K) & 17.8 & 17.8 & 9.0 & 9.0 \\ \(-\mu_{0}dH_{c2}/dT\) (T/K) & 8 & 10 & 2 & 4 \\ \(\mu_{0}H_{p}(0)\) (T) & 33 & 33 & 17 & 17 \\ \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{*}(0)\) (T) & 98.7 & 123.4 & 12.5 & 25.0 \\ \(\alpha\) & 4.22 & 5.28 & 1.06 & 2.11 \\ \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{*}(0)\) (T) & 22.8 & 23.0 &  limited one. The difference between \(H_{c2}^{*}\) and other critical fields is less obvious in PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) and, for \(H\|c\), \(H_{c2}^{*}\) is lower than \(H_{p}\). We can conclude that the paramagnetic (spin) limitation does not affect PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) in which the 5\(f\) Cooper pair breaking is driven by the orbital limitation. On the contrary, it plays a role in PuRhGa\({}_{5}\), where the values of the Maki parameter, anisotropy, and Pauli limitation for \(H\|c\) could suggest the occurrence of a FFLO state. Deviation from the saturation of \(H_{c2}\) observed in this direction for different samples and by different techniques would lead us to consider this phenomenon as intrinsic, and related effectively to the possible development of a FFLO state or strong electron-phonon coupling.
