The lattice parameter refined from x-ray single-crystal measurements is found to be \(a\) = 10.0968(8) A. No signature of impurity phases like OsO\({}_{2}\) or KOsO\({}_{4}\) was found in heat capacity and magnetization measurements.

For the specific heat measurements, we have selected about five dozen of the most regularly shaped single crystals out of a single badge. The total mass of these crystals amounts to 2.12 mg (see inset to Fig. 2), which is enough to measure specific heat with a relaxation method. Special attention must be paid, however, to measuring the addendum contribution as it makes up a significant fraction of the total mass. The specific heat has been measured in a physical properties measurement apparatus using an adiabatic relaxation technique (Quantum Design, PPMS). Resistivity has been measured by a standard four-terminal approach also using the PPMS and the dc magnetization has been measured in a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS). Measurements on RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) have been performed on a sample previously reported upon in Ref. [15]. The synthesis procedure of these polycrystalline RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) samples is described elsewhere.[4, 19]

## III Results

In order to determine the mass enhancement in the normal state and the magnitude of the electron-phonon coupling, it is necessary to measure the Sommerfeld coefficient of the superconductor by driving it into the normal state. Usually this is achieved by applying a magnetic field exceeding the upper critical field \(H_{\rm c2}\). Owing to a high \(H_{\rm c2}\)(0 K) of KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) which is inaccessible by our 14 T magnet, it is not possible to tune KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) into its normal state below about 6.2 K. We therefore resort to an extrapolation method to estimate the Sommerfeld coefficient. First we measure the phase boundary line \(H_{\rm c2}\)(\(T\)) to as low a temperature and high field as possible. We then extrapolate \(H_{\rm c2}\) to 0 K and estimate the Sommerfeld coefficient based on the measured \(C_{\rm p}/T\) versus magnetic field curve at a low temperature. The details of this procedure are given in the following.

### Upper critical field \(H_{\rm c2}\)

We extract the upper critical field \(H_{\rm c2}\) from \(C_{\rm p}\)(\(T\)) data for KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) and from both \(C_{\rm p}\)(\(T\)) and \(C_{\rm p}\)(\(H\)) data for RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\). For both methods, we use a construction of equal area to determine the critical field. The two methods result in almost identical \(H_{\rm c2}\) as can be seen in Fig. 1. In our experience, the \(H_{\rm c2}\) slope at \(T_{\rm c}\) for both RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) and KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) are rather stable quantities varying little from sample to sample. We therefore have a high level of confidence that the observed slope is indeed intrinsic to the material and not mainly limited by a mean free path caused by impurity scattering.

The initial slope of the critical boundary at \(T_{\rm c}\) for KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) is \(-3.6\) T/K, in agreement with the revised value in Refs. [10] and [20]. The full \(H_{\rm c2}\)(\(T\)) dependence cannot be mapped out with the 14 T magnet, so we need to extrapolate to lower temperatures and we proceed in two different ways. First, we notice that \(H_{\rm c2}\)(\(T\)) in RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) is rather well described by the standard Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) expression, with an initial slope of \(-1.2\) T/K and \(\mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}\)(0 K) = 6 T (Fig. 1).[12] If we were to assume the same functional form to hold also for KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\), \(\mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}\)(0 K) = 24 T is estimated. Considering that a typical energy of low-lying phonons in KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) is around 30 K, \(H_{\rm c2}\) might be underestimated in this way. Alternatively, one can extrapolate linearly to \(T\)= 0 K and would estimate \(\mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}\)(0 K) = 35 T. Pursuing this second extrapolation further is motivated by our observation that the last data points in our data lie closer to a straight line extrapolation of the lower-field data, while the WHH curve starts deviating from the data in this region. In the rest of this paper, we thus consider both extrapolations, denoting with (A) the WHH version, and with (B) the linear method. Numerical values for (B) will be enclosed in braces \(\{\}\).

It is worth noting that the RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) and KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) data are fitted best by the WHH formula in the orbital limit (\(\lambda_{\rm SO}\) = \(\infty\)). This is in agreement with a large \(\lambda_{\rm SO}\) expected for the heavy Os ion. Therefore, pair-breaking effects of the magnetic field on the spin degrees of freedom are negligible due to the randomizing effect of the spin-orbit scattering on the phase of the superconducting electrons. An upper limit of the critical field in the case were spin-orbit scattering could be ignored is given by the Pauli limiting field: for KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) it is \(\mu_{0}H_{\rm p}\)=\(\Delta\)(0 K)/(\(\sqrt{2}\mu_{\rm B}\))\(\sqrt{1+\lambda_{\rm op}}\)\(\approx\) 37 T \(\{\)27 T\(\}\), while for

The squares (\(\blacksquare\)) are data points extracted from \(C_{\rm p}/T\) versus \(T\) data, while the circles (\(\bullet\)) are extracted from \(C_{\rm p}/T\) versus \(H\) data. For KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\), two methods to extrapolate to 0 K are used. (A) The dashed line is from the WHH formula in the orbital limit (\(\lambda_{\rm SO}\) = \(\infty\)), providing a good description of the data up to about 9 T, while a description with smaller spin-orbit scattering strength (dotted lines) deviates markedly. (B) The dash-dotted line is a linear fit to the data. The stars mark the Pauli limiting field \(\mu_{0}H_{\rm p}\) for KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\). \(T_{\rm p,1}\) and \(T_{\rm p,2}\) mark two additional peaks observed in the specific heat (Fig. 3) that might be associated with K ordering.

  RbOs2O6 it is about 18 T. Here we have used the values for D(0 K) and acp determined from our measurements as described later and listed in Table I. For RbOs2O6, this field is well above the measured upper critical field, while for KOs2O6 the comparison depends on the extrapolation of \(H_{c2}\). Support for the fact that \(H_{c2}\) is determined by the orbital motion of the electrons and not by their spin is provided by the ratio of the slopes \(-d\mu_{0}H_{c2}/dT\big{|}_{T_{c}}\) for the two materials RbOs2O6 and KOs2O6. The slopes are proportional to \(1/(\pi\nu_{\rm F}^{2})\), where \(\tau\) is the electronic scattering time and \(\nu_{\rm F}\) the Fermi velocity. For the Fermi velocities we use 2.587 x 10\({}^{7}\) cm/s for RbOs2O6 and 2.671 x 10\({}^{7}\) cm/s for KOs2O6.2 The ratio of the Fermi velocities squared, taking into account the renormalization of the Fermi velocity and assuming the same \(\tau\) for both materials, is 2.4 (4.7). This is indeed close to the ratio of \(-d\mu_{0}H_{c2}/dT\big{|}_{T_{c}}\) for RbOs2O6 and KOs2O6. 3.6/1.2=3, suggesting that the pair breaking is caused conventionally by the effect of the magnetic field on the orbital magnetism of the electrons. The difference in magnitude of the upper critical fields is therefore in line with the different mass enhancements.

### Heat capacity in a magnetic field

We have measured the field dependence of \(C_{\rm p}/T\) of KOs2O6 at 0.46 K, shown in Fig. 2. The addendum is =10% of the total heat capacity at \(\mu_{0}H\)=14 T, \(\approx\)20% at \(\mu_{0}H\) =7 T, and \(\approx\)50% at \(\mu_{0}H\)=3 T. Below \(\mu_{0}H\)=1.7 T, the addendum makes up more than 90% of the total heat capacity, and even though both data sets are very smooth, this leads to relatively larger scatter after taking the difference of the two data sets. For this reason, data below 1.7 T have been omitted in the graph and in the fitting procedure.

We parametrize the measured curve by \(C_{\rm p}/T\) =\(a[H\) (Oe)]\({}^{3}\)+\(c\). A least-squares fit down to 1.75 T using this

Figure 2: (Color online) Heat capacity versus magnetic field of KOs2O6 at 0.46 K. An extrapolation to the upper critical field \(H_{c2}\) = 24 T \(\{35\) T\(\}\) results in a Sommerfeld coefficient \(\gamma\) =76 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\)\(\{\gamma\)=110 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\}\). The inset shows the measured crystals.

  form results in \(a\) = (5.86 +- 1.3) x 10-4 mJ/mol K2, \(b\) = 0.9512 +- 0.02, and \(c\) = -0.35 +- 0.4 mJ/mol K2, where \(H\) is given in oersteds. An extrapolation of the _C_p(_H_) curve at 0.46 K to the upper critical field _H_c2 of 24 T {35 T} results in a rather high Sommerfeld coefficient for KOs2O6 of \(g\) = 76 mJ/mol K2 {110 mJ/mol K2}.

The fact that we have measured a vanishingly small _C_p/_T_ at \(H\) = 0 Oe and \(T\) = 0.46 K is of significance for the interpretation of the electronic and vibrational excitation spectrum. First, it indicates that the superconducting state affects the entire electronic system that gives rise to the large \(g\) value (76 - 110 mJ/mol K2). Second, the vibrational excitation spectrum (at 0.46 K) is not characterized by a glasslike spectrum (_C_p  _T_) as one might expect from a broad distribution of two-level configurations possibly associated with the particular lattice potential experienced by the K ions.22

In addition to estimating the Sommerfeld coefficient, measurements of the magnetic-field-dependent heat capacity can be helpful to reveal nodes in the gap function. It is generally thought that a square root dependence _C_p/_T_  _H_* _H_* with \(a\) = 1/2 indicates a gap with nodes, while a linear dependence \(a\) = 1 indicates a fully gapped state.23 This is because the electronic excitations in the vortex state of conventional superconductors are predominantly low-energy excitations localized in the vortex core. On the other hand, the density of states for superconductors with lines of gap nodes results mostly from delocalized states outside the vortex which are located in the vicinity of the gap nodes in momentum space.

We expect that the exponent in the above fit to _C_p versus \(H\) tends even closer toward 1 as \(T\) - 0 K, since the exponent decreases when measuring at increasingly higher temperatures (data not shown). The field dependence of the heat capacity of KOs2O6 thus appears to be in line with a fully gapped state. However, since the measurements do not extend up to _H_c2, further experimental evidence is needed to settle this point conclusively.

### Density of states and mass enhancement

The specific heat for KOs2O6 in various fields is shown in Fig. 3. In addition to the anomaly indicating the transition into the superconducting state, there are two additional peaks at _T_p,1 (=6.5 K) and _T_p,2 (=7 K). The origin of these peaks is unclear at this point. They are likely to be associated with the dynamics of the potassium ions in this compound. While we measure two peaks for our sample, a single peak has been reported in Refs. [10] and [20] at a slightly higher temperature (about 7.5 K)--the transition seems to be very sensitive to microscopic details.

From the specific heat jump at _T_c, \(\Delta\)C_p|_r_c/_T_c = 204 mJ/mol K2, the normalized specific heat jump \(\Delta\)C_p|_T_c/(g_T_c) = 2.7 {1.9} is extracted. It is significantly larger than in the weak-coupling limit and corresponds to an electron-phonon coupling constant \(\lambda_{\text{op}}\)=2\(\int_{0}^{\infty}\)\(\alpha^{2}F(\omega)/\omega\)_do_  \(\approx\) 1.6 {1.0},24 i.e., KOs2O6 is a superconductor in the strong-coupling regime. Here, \(\alpha^{2}F(\omega)\) is the spectral density of the electron-phonon coupling function. Using the calculated band Sommerfeld coefficient \(\gamma_{\text{b}}\)=9.8\(-\)11.36 mJ/mol K2 of KOs2O6 from Refs. [22] and [25], this result indicates a significant enhancement of the electronic specific heat of (1 + \(\lambda_{\text{op}}\)) \(\times\)(1 + \(\lambda_{\text{o}}\)) = (76 mJ/mol K2)/(10.6 mJ/mol K2) = 7.2 {10.4}, i.e., about double the enhancement found in Sr2RuO4 of 3.8\(-\)4.26,27 This quantification of \(\lambda_{\text{op}}\) then leaves a significant additional enhancement \(\lambda_{\text{c}}\)  1.7 {4.3} ascribed to electron-electron correlations.

Figure 4 illustrates the density of states for KOs2O6 and RbOs2O6 and the weak-coupling \(\alpha\)-pyrochlore superconductor Cd2Re2O7 for comparison. The depicted band density of states for \(A\)Os2O6 is the arithmetic mean of the two calculated values in Refs. [22] and [25], and the values for Cd2Re2O7 are taken from Refs. [6] and [28]. It increases very slightly on going from \(A\) = K to \(A\) = Rb to Cd2Re2O7, but is rather similar overall. The electronic structure in the local density approximation (LDA) as a whole is in fact very similar for all \(A\)Os2O6. The electron-phonon enhancement, on the other hand varies significantly: \(\lambda_{\text{op}}\) is less than about 0.4 for Cd2Re2O7, but falls in the intermediate- to strong-coupling range for the osmates (1-1.6), indicating that there is a significant difference in the coupling functions leading to the superconducting state. The difference in the additional enhancement \(\lambda_{\text{c}}\) is pronounced: it increases more than twofold from RbOs2O6 to KOs2O6, in the same direction as \(\lambda_{\text{op}}\).

To gain further insight into the mechanisms responsible for the density of states enhancement, it is helpful to consider the magnetic susceptibility (Fig. 5). Since samples of RbOs2O6 also contain some OsO2, the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility is calculated according to \(\chi_{1}\)= \(\eta_{\text{m}}^{-1}\chi\)= (\(\eta_{\text{m}}^{-1}\) - 1)\(\chi_{2}\), where \(\chi_{1}\) is the magnetic susceptibility of RbOs2O6, \(\chi_{2}\) that of OsO2, and \(\chi\) is the measured susceptibility of the mixed system (cf Sec. III.5). The susceptibilities in this formula are given per mass. The correction due to OsO2 is very small, since the susceptibility per Os is very similar in both systems. Even after taking into account the correction for OsO2, the susceptibility of RbOs2O6 still shows a slight in

Figure 3: (Color online) Heat capacity versus temperature of KOs2O6 for various magnetic fields. The specific heat jump at _T_c, \(\Delta\)_C_p|_T_c/_T_c, is 204 mJ/mol K2, from which the normalized specific heat jump \(\Delta\)C_p|_T_c/(g_T_c) = 2.7 {1.9} is extracted. It is significantly larger than that for the weak-coupling case and corresponds to an electron-phonon coupling constant \(\lambda_{\text{op}}\)  1.6}, i.e., KOs2O6 is a superconductor in the strong-coupling regime. There are two transitions at _T_p,1 = 6.5 K and _T_p,2 × 7 K that might be associated with K ordering.

  crease at low temperatures and also a shoulder around 25 K. This is probably due to minute amounts of magnetic RbOsO\({}_{4}\). We note that a similar \(T\) dependence as for the susceptibility has been observed for the Knight shift in both RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) and KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\)[29].

We correct for the diamagnetism of the core using \(\chi\) =\(\chi_{\rm exp}\)\(-\chi_{\rm core}\) with \(\chi_{\rm core}\)=\(-\)12, \(-\)20, \(-\)13, and \(-\)18 \(\mu\)cm\({}^{3}\)/mol for O\({}^{2-}\), Rb\({}^{+}\), K\({}^{+}\), and Os\({}^{6+}\) ions, respectively. Landau diamagnetism can be neglected, due to the enhancement of the electron mass. For the experimental susceptibility, we use the value at 150 K, resulting in a susceptibility for KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) of \(\chi^{\rm ram}\)\(\approx\) 3.7\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) cm\({}^{3}\)/mol. The Sommerfeld-Wilson ratio evaluates to \(R_{\rm W}\)=0.93 G\({}^{2}\) cm\({}^{3}\)/erg [0.65 G\({}^{2}\) cm\({}^{3}\)/erg] where we have used the renormalized Sommerfeld coefficient \(\gamma\)/(1 + \(\lambda_{\rm cp}\)) since the Pauli magnetic susceptibility is not affected by electron-phonon interactions. For RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) follows \(\chi^{\rm ram}\)\(\approx\) 5.3\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) cm\({}^{3}\)/mol and \(R_{\rm W}\)= 1.75 G\({}^{2}\) cm\({}^{3}\)/erg. In view of a calculated Stoner enhancement of the magnetic susceptibility of roughly 2 for all \(A\)Os\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) (Refs. [22] and [25]), the Wilson ratio for RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) closely matches the expected result. On the other hand, \(R_{\rm W}\) for KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) is clearly smaller than what would be expected. In this simple estimate, we have neglected possible orbital van Vleck terms that may also contribute to the paramagnetic susceptibility.

### Superconducting properties

It is instructive to calculate the various thermodynamic parameters for KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) and RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\). We get a strong-coupling parameter \(x\) = \(k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}\)/(\(\hbar\omega_{\rm th}\))=0.13 {0.06} by applying the approximate semiphenomenological form of the strong-coupling correction to the weak-coupling BCS ratio which holds for many superconductors \(\Delta C_{\rm p}|_{T_{\rm c}}/(\gamma T_{\rm c})\)= 1.43[ \(-\)53\(x^{2}\ln(3x)\)].[30] Here \(\hbar\omega_{\rm th}\) is the Allen-Dynes expression for the average phonon energy. With this strong-coupling parameter we further get a normalized energy gap of \(2\Delta(0\) K)/(\(k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}\))= 3.53[ \(1-12.5x^{2}\ln(2x)\)]=4.57 {3.83}. Since we know from RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) that another strong-coupling correction [\(1/(8\pi)\)]\(\gamma T_{\rm c}^{2}/(-\Delta F)\)= 0.168[ \(1+12.2x^{2}\ln(3x)\)], holds quite well,[15] it is reasonable to assume that it also holds for KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\). Using the experimental \(T_{\rm c}\), \(\gamma\), and the strong-coupling parameter from above, we can estimate the condensation energy of KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\): \(-\Delta F\)=2050 mJ/mol {2533 mJ/mol}, corresponding to a thermodynamic critical field of \(H_{\rm c}\)=2579 Oe (2867 Oe). In this conversion we have used the calculated mass density of KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) using the lattice constant from x-ray diffraction, \(\rho\)=6.653 g/cm\({}^{3}\). The ratio [\(1/(8\pi)\)](\(\gamma T_{\rm c}^{2}\))/(\(-\Delta F\)) itself evaluates to 0.135 {0.157}.

Once the condensation energy is known, various thermodynamic quantities can be evaluated: for \(bT_{\rm c}\)= (\(T\Delta C_{\rm p}\))\(|_{T_{\rm c}}\)/(\(-\Delta F\)) we get 9.02 {7.30}, giving a normalized critical field slope \(Q\)= 4.25 {3.82}. The critical field slope itself evaluates to \(-dH_{\rm c}\)/\(dT|_{T_{\rm c}}\)= 575 Oe/K. The slope of the upper critical field is about three times steeper than the one from RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\): with \(-d\mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}\)/\(dT|_{T_{\rm c}}\)= 3.6 T/K (Fig. 1) we get a Ginzburg-Landau parameter at the critical temperature of \(\kappa(T_{\rm c})\)= 45. At \(T\)\(\rightarrow\) 0 K, we estimate \(\kappa(0\) K)=(1/\(\sqrt{2}\))\(H_{\rm c2}\)/\(H_{\rm c}\)= 66 {86} and thus a penetration depth of 243 nm {265 nm}, which compares well with results from \(\mu\)SR experiments (270 nm).[17] The Ginzburg-Landau coherence length amounts to

Figure 4: Comparison of the Sommerfeld coefficients for RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\), KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\), and the weak-coupling \(\alpha\)-pyrochlore superconductor Cd\({}_{2}\)Re\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\). Shown are the calculated bare coefficients \(\gamma_{\rm h}\) in white, the electron-electron enhanced coefficients (1 + \(\lambda_{\rm c}\))\(\gamma_{\rm h}\) in hatched, and the measured coefficients (1 + \(\lambda_{\rm cp}\))(1 + \(\lambda_{\rm c}\))\(\gamma_{\rm h}\) in cross hatched. The bare band value from density functional theory calculations in the LDA is rather similar for all three pyrochlores. The electron-phonon coupling \(\lambda_{\rm cp}\) increases from less than 0.4 (weak coupling) for Cd\({}_{2}\)Re\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) to 1 for RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) to 1.0–1.6 for KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\). The two sets of values (A) and (B) for KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) correspond to the two choices of extrapolating \(H_{\rm c2}\)(T) in Fig. 1.

  \(\xi\)=37 A (31 A) and the lower critical field \(H_{\rm c1}\) = ln \(\kappa\)/(\(\sqrt{2}\kappa\))\(H_{\rm c}\)=116 Oe {105 Oe}. This lower critical field is in agreement with magnetization measurements (not shown). The Ginzburg-Landau coherence length is about half that of RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\). The parameters are listed in Table 1, where they are compared to the values of RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) taken from Ref. [15] for convenience.

\(H_{\rm c2}\) for KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) is beyond the 14 T accessible in our current setup, so that the samples cannot be tuned to the normal state below about 6.2 K. There is thus no reference measurement for the heat capacity in the normal state and the superconducting electronic specific heat \(C_{\rm es}\) cannot be determined by a simple subtraction of a normal state and a superconducting state measurement. This renders determining additional contributions to the heat capacity other than the usual phononic and electronic terms difficult.

### Unusual low-energy atomic vibrations

The specific heat of RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) is analyzed using the condensation energy analysis (CEA) developed in Ref. [15]. This is necessary because it is not yet possible to synthesize a fully phase-pure RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) sample. OsO\({}_{2}\) has been identified by x-ray diffraction analysis as a secondary phase. This shortcoming is compensated by the fact that by using the CEA it is possible to extract the intrinsic properties of superconducting RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) even if the samples contain some unreacted OsO\({}_{2}\) starting material.

The full temperature dependence of the intrinsic heat capacity of RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) is therefore obtained by subtracting the appropriate amount of the OsO\({}_{2}\) heat capacity contribution according to \(C_{1}\) = \(\eta_{m}^{-1}C\) - (\(\eta_{m}^{-1}\)\(-\)1)\(C_{2}\). Here, \(C_{1}\) is the heat capacity of RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\), \(C_{2}\) of OsO\({}_{2}\), and \(C\) is the measured heat capacity of the mixed system, all in energy per temperature per mass. To this end we have measured a sample of the starting material OsO\({}_{2}\). Its heat capacity is shown in Fig. 6 (\(C_{2}\)) together with the heat capacity of a RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) sample (\(C\)) with a superconducting mass fraction of \(\eta_{m}\)=74.9%. Hence, the difference between the mixed system heat capacity \(C\) and 25.1% of \(C_{2}\) (shaded region) is 74.9% of the intrinsic heat capacity of RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\)\(C_{1}\). The Sommerfeld coefficients used in the plot are \(\gamma\)=27.5 \(\mu\)J/g K\({}^{2}\) for OsO\({}_{2}\) and \(\gamma\)=70.3 \(\mu\)J/g K\({}^{2}\) for the RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) sample.

The resulting specific heat of RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) (\(C_{1}\)) on a logarithmic temperature scale is shown in Fig. 7. In such a plot, an Einstein contribution to the heat capacity appears as a bell-shaped feature with a peak at \(T\)=\(T_{E}\)/4.93.[31] The data clearly indicate such a contribution with an Einstein temperature of 60 K and a density of 0.33\(\times\)9 modes/f.u. Assuming this phonon involves the displacement of the Rb atoms, this means an effective number of three modes per Rb ion. Three modes are compatible with a three-dimensional potential for the Rb ions to move in as is expected from the tetrahedral symmetry of the Rb site.

As the KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) samples are high-quality single crystals, the KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) data can be analyzed as measured. We have observed a vanishingly small residual Sommerfeld coefficient (\(C_{p}\)/\(T\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\sim\)0.35\(\pm\)0.4 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) as \(H\)\(\rightarrow\) 0 Oe at 0.46 K) as expected from a single-phase sample and indicative of a fully gapped electronic excitation spectrum. The temperature-dependent lattice heat capacity data are shown in Fig. 8. In the normal state above 6.2 K, \(\gamma T\) was used for the electronic heat capacity \(C_{\rm el}\). The low-temperature data from 2 to 3.8 K were obtained using the electronic heat capacity of an isotropic superconductor \(C_{\rm el}\)=\(\,C_{\rm es}\)=\(\,8.5\gamma T_{\rm c}\)\(\times\)exp[\(-\)1.44\(\times\)2\(\lambda\)(0 K)/3.53\(\times\)\(T_{\rm c}\)/\(T\)]. The data do not fit as nicely to a combined Debye-Einstein model as do the data for RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\). This might be due to the alkali-metal-ion po

It illustrates the significant additional heat capacity present in RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\). The difference between \(C\) and the shaded region is 74.9% of the intrinsic heat capacity of RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\).

In such a plot, an Einstein contribution to the heat capacity appears as a bell-shaped feature with a maximum at \(T\)=\(T_{E}\)/4.93 (Ref. [31]). The data are well described by a combined Debye-Einstein model with \(\Theta_{\rm D}\)=325 K, \(T_{\rm E}\)=60 K, and \(n\)\(\approx\) 0.33 \(\times\)9 modes per f.u.

  tential being very anharmonic, leading to a vibrational spectrum that is not simply modeled by an Einstein mode. Nevertheless, we show a best fit of an Einstein contribution to the data in the figure, resulting in \(n\) = 0.15 \(\times\) 9 modes/f.u. and \(T_{\rm E}\)=31 K. For the Debye contribution which is expected to result mainly from the rigid Os-O network we have reused the Debye temperature from RbOs2O6. The question about the low-energy lattice dynamics appears to be central to the physics of KOs2O6. The calculated anharmonic potential for the K ion results in a set of discrete vibrational energies, leading to a distinct \(T\) dependence of the specific heat.[32] The data deviate markedly from this model calculation at low temperature (Fig. 8). Possibly, this indicates a freezing of the dynamic motion of the alkali-metal ion.

### Resistivity

As has been noted before,[4] the resistivity of KOs2O6 shows a peculiar downward curvature, which extends to the lowest measured temperatures. This downward curvature also exists in the other \(A\)Os2O6 compounds, though at different temperatures: the curve looks like an additional hump superimposed on a more smooth background, the hump having its peak at a temperature shifting systematically to higher temperatures on going from \(A\) = K to Cs. We analyze this behavior by taking the derivative of the resistivity with respect to temperature and then locating the maximum of the resulting curve. Owing to varying effective geometric factors due to grain sizes, the absolute values of the resistivities among samples vary significantly. In Fig. 9 we therefore show the normalized derivative of the resistivity where we have set the peak value to unity.

For illustrative purposes, we compare these results with a model calculation for the resistivity caused by an Einstein phonon[33]

\[\rho_{\rm ph}=\frac{2\,\pi m^{*}\,\alpha^{2}F_{\rm E}}{ne^{2}}\frac{\,\coth(T_ {\rm E}/2T)}{1+2/3\,\sinh^{2}(T_{\rm E}/2T)},\] (1)

where \(m^{*}\) is the averaged band mass, \(\alpha^{2}F_{\rm E}\) is an Einstein spectral function, \(n\) is the number of conduction electrons per unit volume, \(e\) is the elementary charge, and \(k_{\rm B}T_{\rm E}\) is the energy of the Einstein mode. The inset of Fig. 9 shows the derivative of the model resistivity for a peak at 50 K. It describes the data well at low temperatures, but deviates at higher temperatures, where the model predicts a resistivity linear in \(T\).

The resulting temperatures \(T_{\rm peak}\) at which \(d\rho/dT\) peaks are plotted in Fig. 10 versus \(T_{\rm Einstein}\), the energy of the Einstein phonon mode extracted from the heat capacity measurement. \(T_{\rm Einstein}\) = 70 K for CsOs2O6 is taken from Refs. [10] and [34]. It can be shown that the derivative of the model resistivity \(d\rho_{\rm ph}/dT\) shows a maximum at \(T_{\rm peak}\)=\(T_{\rm E}/a\), where \(a\) = 2.243.[43] For illustrative purposes, this line is shown along the experimental results from \(A\)Os2O6 in Fig. 10. As one might expect, this simple Einstein phonon model is not sufficient to describe the entire \(\rho(T)\) curves, because scattering at other phonons is not included. If a second phonon is considered and the resulting resistivity is assumed to be simply the sum of the two single-phonon results according to Mathihess's rule, then the location of the peak moves more toward the measured points: in an analysis of the specific heat data, Hiroi _et al.[10, 34]_ have explained their data using a second phonon at around 140 K for RbOs2O6 and around 175 K for CsOs2O6. Including a phonon at these temperatures moves the peak location up in temperature to 51 K for RbOs2O6 and 64 K for CsOs2O6, shown by (blue) stars and arrows in Fig. 10. The deviation of the CsOs2O6 \(T_{\rm peak}\) toward even higher temperatures may be due to the fact that at these temperatures a significant contribution to the phonon spectrum already stems from the Debye phonons neglected up to

Figure 8: (Color online) \((C_{\rm p}-C_{\rm cl})/T^{3}\) of KOs2O6 on a logarithmic temperature scale. The dashed line shows a combined Einstein-Debye contribution with \(n\) = 0.15 \(\times\) 9 modes/f.u., \(T_{\rm E}\)=31 K, and \(\Theta_{\rm D}\)=325 K to illustrate a best fit to the data if an Einstein-type contribution is assumed. We use the Debye temperature from RbOs2O6 (Fig. 7). The dotted line indicates the large lattice contribution expected at low temperatures from a K ion in an anharmonic potential (Ref. [32]). The absence of such a contribution may indicate a freezing of the rattling motion at \(T_{\rm p,\it\it\cdot}\) (A) and (B) refer to the two extrapolations used to extract \(\gamma\) as described in the main text.

The inset shows the calculation for a single Einstein phonon.

## IV Discussion

The systematic variation of the position of the maximum slope in the resistivity indicates a close connection between the dynamics of the alkali-metal ion \(A\) and the electronic transport properties. KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) is somewhat different from the other two compounds, because its peak temperature is lower than expected from the simple Einstein phonon model (Fig. 10). This might be a result of the strong anharmonicity of the cage potential. It is known that the alkali-metal ions move in a strongly anharmonic potential and couple to the conduction electrons owing to their large excursion from equilibrium, and previous results have been interpreted in this scenario.[10, 34] This results in the electron-phonon coupling parameter \(\lambda_{\rm{rep}}\) increasing, driving KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) more toward the strong-coupling regime. Electron scattering from the alkali-metal mode as the reason for the downward curvature of the resistivity has been suggested before by Kunes _et al.[22]_ While the scattering at phonons seems to be the most plausible mechanism at this point, other scenarios for the peculiar behavior of the resistivity are also conceivable: Fermi surface nesting has been found in KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) and has been proposed as the driving force for strong spin fluctuations.[35] It remains to be worked out in detail to what degree such fluctuations or even more exotic excitations could account for the measured resistivity. We note, however, that the static susceptibility of KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) is not significantly enhanced; rather it is smaller than expected based on the band density of states.

In the following we try to identify the various contributions to the measured mass enhancement reflected in the Sommerfeld coefficient \(\gamma\). It is known that Coulomb and electron-phonon effects in a metal can be combined in a multiplicative fashion.[36] An interpretation of the additional enhancement in terms of Coulomb correlations would therefore mean a parametrization according to 1+\(\lambda\)=(1+\(\lambda_{\rm{ep}}\))(1 +\(\lambda_{\rm{c}}\)). In this interpretation the overall bandwidth is reduced by a factor of 1+\(\lambda_{\rm{c}}\) due to electron-electron interactions. The resulting Coulomb enhancement parameter \(\lambda_{\rm{c}}\) for RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) is \(\approx\)1.0 and for KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) it is \(\approx\)1.7 [4.3], from which we estimate the interaction strength: assuming a conduction electron density of \(n\)=2 electrons per Os, we can make a crude estimate of the Coulomb interaction potential: \(V_{\rm{c}}\) =\(n\lambda_{\rm{c}}/N(0)\)= 2 eV for RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) and 3 eV [9 eV] for KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\). Here, \(N(0)\)=\(g\)(\(E_{\rm{F}}\))/2 is the density of states at the Fermi level for one spin direction. Both of these values indicate a large electron correlation.

It is instructive to compare the \(A\)Os\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) series with a Ru-based \(\alpha\)-pyrochlore series, where variations of the Ru-O-Ru angle results in a drastic change of the density of states. The compound Y\({}_{2-x}\)Bi\({}_{1}\)Ru\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) is a Mott insulator for small \(x\) and a normal paramagnetic metal for \(x\)\(\approx\) 2. The band Sommerfeld coefficient of Bi\({}_{2}\)Ru\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) is calculated to be 8.0 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\),[37] resulting in a very small mass enhancement (\(\lambda\)\(\approx\) 0.23). The correlations increase upon Y substitution resulting in an increase of the Sommerfeld coefficient from about 10 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) at \(x\)\(\approx\) 2 to almost 90 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) at \(x\)\(\approx\) 0.9.[38] The enhancement at \(x\)= 0.9 is thus substantial: \(\lambda\)\(\approx\) 10. Below this critical value correlations become so strong that a gap opens in the density of states and the Sommerfeld coefficient decreases rapidly and vanishes in the Mott insulating state. Using the same arguments as above for \(A\)Os\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\), the interaction potential \(V_{\rm{c}}\) in Y\({}_{1.1}\)Bi\({}_{0.0}\)Ru\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) is of the order of 10 eV, certainly large enough to cause a gap for a bandwidth of typically 3 eV. At the same time the Ru-O-Ru angle is reduced from about 139\({}^{\circ}\) for Bi\({}_{2}\)Ru\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) to 129\({}^{\circ}\) for Y\({}_{2}\)Ru\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\).[39] This strongly indicates that a decreasing \(B\)-O-\(B\) angle causes the band to narrow and the correlations among conduction electrons to increase. \(A\)Os\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) shows the same tendency: the Os-O-Os angle in RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) is 139.4\({}^{\circ}\) (\(\gamma\)=44 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\)), while that for KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) is 137.9\({}^{\circ}\) (\(\gamma\) =76\(-\)110 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\)). We thus interpret the mass of \(A\)Os\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) to be increasingly enhanced by electron correlations going from \(A\)=Cs to \(A\)=K. Possibly the correlations are especially strong in some subband, leading to a charge-density-wave-like or orbitally ordered state at around 7 K (\(T_{\rm{p,1}}\) and \(T_{\rm{p,2}}\) in Fig. 3).

This is consistent with another series of pyrochlores: according to Solovyev,[40] a decreasing Mo-O-Mo angle in \(R_{2}\)Mo\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) reduces the interaction between Mo(\(t_{2g}\)) orbitals which is mediated by O(\(2p\)) states, causing diminishing overlap and thus enhanced mass. Although this author finds the lattice parameter to be the relevant parameter determin

Figure 10: (Color online) Systematic variation with the \(A\) ion of the maximum in the temperature derivative of the resistivity \(T_{\rm{peak}}\) versus the characteristic temperature of the low-energy phonon \(T_{\rm{Einstein}}\) extracted from heat capacity measurements. For illustration we show where the maxima are expected to lie according to the solution of the linearized Boltzmann equation for a single phonon by a dashed line (Ref. [33]). Inclusion of a second phonon by Matthiessen’s rule at around 140 K for RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) and around 175 K for CsOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) (Refs. [10; 34]) moves the peak temperature up toward the measured value shown by the (blue) stars and arrows.

  ing the physics of the compound, the physical properties of various pyrochlores appear to be more appropriately parametrized by the metal-oxygen-metal angle.

An effective Hubbard \(U\) of 2 eV is in line with other transition metals. According to Ref. [28], this is not enough to classify Cd\({}_{2}\)Os\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) as a strongly correlated system. In Ref. [40], however, a \(U\) of 1.5\(-\)2.5 eV explains the Mott-insulating properties of \(R_{2}\)Mo\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) very well. This might be a somewhat weak argument, because Cd\({}_{2}\)Os\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) is a 5\(d\) material while \(R_{2}\)Mo\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) is 4\(d\), which are usually more strongly correlated. On the other hand, the LDA bandwidth of \(A\)Os\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) is in the region of \(W\)\(\approx\) 3 eV [23, 24], and the interaction potential \(V_{\rm c}\) is therefore comparable to \(W\) and thus the Mott-Hubbard localization concept is applicable. The anomalous pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature is in line with these findings [41]: Hydrostatic pressure reduces the correlations working against superconductivity, thus initially increasing the critical temperature. For this reason it would be of interest to see if NaOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) shows metallic or insulating behavior.

It is enlightening to compare the electronic structure of \(A\)Os\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) to the one of OsO\({}_{2}\), since, in a (limited) way, OsO\({}_{2}\) can be regarded as \(A\)Os\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) without the \(A\). It has a rutile structure with the OsO\({}_{6}\) octahedra sharing edges in the \(c\) direction and corners in the plane perpendicular to \(c\)[42]. While the Os-Os distance to the neighboring octahedron with the shared edge and the length of the shared edge itself are shorter than the Os-Os and O-O distances in \(A\)Os\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\), all other Os-O, O-O, and Os-Os distances in OsO\({}_{2}\) are slightly longer than the ones in \(A\)Os\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\). The Os-O-Os angles in OsO\({}_{2}\) are 105.0\({}^{\circ}\) along the \(c\) axis and 127.5\({}^{\circ}\) perpendicular to it. Pyrochlores with a \(B\)-O-\(B\) angle around 127\({}^{\circ}\) usually are in an insulating state. Directional resistivity measurements on OsO\({}_{2}\) could thus be quite insightful in this respect.

The density of states at the Fermi level for OsO\({}_{2}\) of about 13\(-\)15 states/unit cell Ry spin from the band structure calculation in Ref. [42] results in a Sommerfeld coefficient \(\gamma_{\rm b}\)\(\approx\) 2.4 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\), We measure a \(\gamma\) of about 6.1 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\), resulting in a specific heat enhancement of about 1\(+\lambda\) = 6.1/2.4 \(\approx\) 2.5. Assuming a small electron-phonon coupling in OsO\({}_{2}\) of \(\lambda_{\rm ep}\)\(\approx\) 0.2 and an enhancement of the form \(\gamma/\gamma_{\rm b}\) = (1\(+\)\(\lambda_{\rm ep}\))(1\(+\)\(\lambda_{\rm c}\)), this results in an enhancement due to correlations of \(\lambda_{\rm c}\)\(\approx\) 1.1. This is quite a large enhancement parameter similar to the one of \(A\)Os\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\), providing further evidence that the Coulomb correlations are inherent to the Os-O system.

Recent calculations have shown that the electronic structure does not change significantly on changing the alkali-metal ion \(A\)[25]. Therefore, all these considerations point to the need to consider interactions that are not captured in the electronic structure calculations. In light of the significant electron-phonon interaction, and even stronger effects due to electron correlations, it will be of interest to further focus on the possible role played by the three-dimensional triangular geometry of the Os-O network. In view of the strong electron correlations, the frustrated geometry might be of importance in these materials.

We take the nonsuperconducting state of Y\({}_{2-x}\)Bi\({}_{x}\)Ru\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) to be a clear indication that the additional enhancement mechanism is to be regarded separately from the pairing mechanism. Both \(A\)Os\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) and Y\({}_{2-x}\)Bi\({}_{x}\)Ru\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) show significant enhancement due to correlations, but only \(A\)Os\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) is superconducting. The question thus remains why \(A\)Os\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) is superconducting and Y\({}_{2-x}\)Bi\({}_{x}\)Ru\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7}\) is not. The answer may lie in the electron-phonon coupling, which is unusually large in \(A\)Os\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\). We expect this to be due to the \(\beta\)-pyrochlore instead of the \(\alpha\)-pyrochlore structure, which leaves the 16\(d\) site empty and the 8\(b\) site occupied by \(A\) instead of an oxygen atom. This should significantly modify the phonon spectrum, resulting in a large \(\lambda_{\rm ep}\).

## V Conclusion

Our data from high-quality single-crystalline KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) show that KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) is a particularly interesting transition metal oxide: it is an intermediate- to strong-coupling type-II superconductor with a coupling parameter \(\lambda_{\rm ep}\) = 1\(-\)1.6. KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) has a high Sommerfeld coefficient for a pyrochlore of 76\(-\)110 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\). We estimate a Ginzburg-Landau coherence length \(\xi\) = 31\(-\)37 A, about half the one in RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) due to the renormalization of the Fermi velocity \(v_{\rm F}\). We estimate the condensation energy \(-\Delta F\) = 2.0\(-\)2.5 J/mol. The effective mass, even after the measured strong electron-phonon renormalization is taken into account, is threefold enhanced over the LDA band mass. We interpret this as due to Coulomb correlations. The renormalization affects those electrons that are paired to form the superconducting condensate. While for RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) the additional heat capacity can be well characterized by an Einstein model, the contribution for KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\) is somewhat more unusual, possibly due to strong anharmonicity. We associate this special phonon with a rattling motion of the alkali-metal ions, resulting in three modes per Rb for RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\). In KOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\), the absence of lattice heat capacity at low temperatures may indicate the freezing of this motion. The dynamics of the alkali-metal ions causes large scattering of the charge carriers which shows up in an unusual temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity which varies systematically with the alkali-metal ion.
