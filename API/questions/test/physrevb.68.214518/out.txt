###### Abstract

ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} is superconducting at T_{c} = 7.3 K and is shown to partially reenter the normal state between 5.5 and 5.7 K in zero applied field by means of ac-susceptibility (\chi_{\rm av}^{\prime}) and resistivity measurements. Specific heat (C_{p}) measurements give a magnetic ordering temperature T_{\rm N} = 5.7 \pm 0.2 K. Powder neutron diffraction measurements showed that the Er^{3+} magnetic moments adopt below T_{\rm N} = 5.9 \pm 0.2 K a transverse modulated structure along the a axis (**q**=0.559**a*). Observation of third-order and fifth-order harmonics indicates a squaring of the structure at lower temperature (8.2 \mu_{\rm B} at 1.4 K). Although even-order peaks could not be detected in the neutron data, a weak ferromagnetic transition at T_{\rm WFM} = 2.2 K could be directly evidenced by magnetic susceptibility measurements and C_{p} measurements and indirectly evidenced in the thermal variations of the intensity of the first-order magnetic peaks (I_{\rm q}), the magnetic coherence length (\xi_{\rm av}), and the magnetic wave vector (**q**). The magnetic structure of ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} is nearly identical to that of the parent compound ErNi_{2}B_{2}C. Precise comparison between the temperature variations of I_{\rm q}, \xi_{\rm av}, and \chi_{\rm av}^{\prime} shows that the transverse **a***-modulated magnetic structure is responsible for the reentrant behavior between 5.5 and 5.7 K. Although it is still pair breaking below 5.5 K, it coexists with superconductivity. ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectra display no broadening in the temperature range where the reentrant behavior is observed, showing that the transferred hyperfine field at the Fe site, if any, is smaller than 2 kOe.

## I Introduction

Four of the rare-earth (_R_) nickel-borocarbides _R_Ni_{2}B_{2}C (_R_ = Dy, Ho, Er, Tm (Ref. 1)) exhibit coexistence of a magnetic order with superconductivity. The magnetic moments originate from the localized 4f electrons of the rare earth, and they are exchange coupled by the RKKY interaction mediated by the conduction electrons. Many experiments have shown the interaction of superconductivity with the rare-earth-ordered sublattice in these compounds. One of its most dramatic manifestation is the local minimum observed close to the Neel temperature _T_N in the upper critical field H_{c2}(T) curve of HoNi_{2}B_{2}C, [1, 2, 3, 4] ErNi_{2}B_{2}C, [5, 6] and TmNi_{2}B_{2}C. [7] This effect is obviously related to the onset of magnetic order but the detailed mechanism is not yet fully understood.

In HoNi_{2}B_{2}C (T_{c} = 8.5 _K_), the minimum is attributed to the competition between superconductivity and a magnetic helical structure (**q**=0.915**c* (Refs. 8-10)) or to a partially determined magnetic structure (**q**=0.585**a*, moment orientation unknown (Refs. 11-13)), or to both structures (Refs. 3 and 14), as they are both observed in the 5-6K temperature region where H_{c2} is depressed. Below 5 K the Ho^{3+} moments adopt a commensurate antiferromagnetic structure and H_{c2} increases again. Depending on the samples, a small magnetic field ranging from 0 to 700 Oe can drive this compound reentrant: it becomes superconducting at 8.5 K, reenters the normal state at 6 K, and superconductivity appears again at 5 K. [1, 2, 3, 4]

TmNi_{2}B_{2}C (T_{c} = 11 _K_) exhibits below 1.5 K a transverse sine-wave structure with **q**=0.094(**a*+**b*) in zero applied field. [15, 16, 17] In an applied field H = 0.9 T parallel to **a**, this low-field structure transforms into a new structure with **q**=0.48**a* (Ref. 18) which is stable at least up to H = H_{c2}(0 _K_) = 2 T. This high-field structure is potentially responsible for the depression of H_{c2}(T) in TmNi_{2}B_{2}C below \sim 2 K.

ErNi_{2}B_{2}C becomes superconducting at T_{c} = 10.5 K and the Er^{3+} moments adopt a transverse sine-wave structure [**q**=0.553**a*, **m**[**b**] at T_{\rm N} = 6 K. [19, 20, 21, 22] An incommensurate magnetic structure with **q**=0.4-0.6**a* is a common feature of these three magnetic _R_Ni_{2}B_{2}C compounds and is caused by a nesting of their Fermi surface at this **q** vector. [23] Single-crystal measurements in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C (Refs. 5 and 6) with an applied field H parallel to the **c** axis have shown that H_{c2}(T) sharply decreases at 6 K (from 16 to 14 kOe for the best  samples) and starts increasing again at 5.5 K [H_{c2}(2\,K) = 20 kOe]. This effect is anisotropic because for _H_II(**a**,**b**), H_{c2}(T) only exhibits an inflection point around 5 K. A similar feature is also observed in the lower-critical field H_{c1}(T) curve.[24, 25] The magnetic structure undergoes a transition from antiferromagnetism to weak ferromagnetism at T_{\rm WFM} = 2.3 K,[21, 26] which causes an increase of critical current due to enhanced pinning of the flux line lattice.[27]

Although superconductivity is more "robust" in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C than in HoNi_{2}B_{2}C, a reentrant behavior can be observed in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C by applying a field larger than \sim 11 kOe.[5] Thus a direct and precise comparison between H_{c2}(T) in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C and neutron magnetic diffraction data usually obtained in zero applied field is difficult: T_{\rm N} depends on the applied field in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C,[5] and even worse, in the case of TmNi_{2}B_{2}C this would be misleading, as the zero-field magnetic structure is not the existing structure at H_{c2}. One way to overcome this difficulty is to depress globally the H_{c2}(T) curve until its local minimum crosses the T axis and one observes a reentrant behavior in zero applied field. Of course, T_{c} is simutaneously depressed. This was obtained by Schmidt and Braun in HoNi_{2}B_{2}C and in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [28]) by substituting cobalt on the nickel site: HoNi_{1.99}Co_{0.01}B_{2}C and ErNi_{1.993}Co_{0.065}Ni_{2}B_{2}C both exhibit reentrant superconductivity in zero applied field. Although magnetic neutron diffraction measurements were reported on nonsuperconducting HoNi_{1.988}Co_{0.015}B_{2}C,[29, 30] no result was reported on the two above-mentioned reentrant compounds.

Iron doping also depresses T_{c} of the _R_Ni_{2}B_{2}C compounds,[28, 31, 32] and it was expected that, similarly to cobalt, it would depress H_{c2} and induce reentrant superconductivity in zero applied field in ErNi_{2-x}Fe_{x}B_{2}C. Therefore, we report in this paper that ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} is a reentrant superconductor (T_{c} = 7.3 K, T_{\rm N}= 5.9 K, T_{\rm WFM}= 2.2 K) in zero applied field. As the determination of the magnetic structures of ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} of high interest to look for correlations with its exotic superconducting properties, we carried out neutron powder diffraction. Accordingly, we also performed ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy measurements to examine if the magnetic structure present in the reentrant region leads to the introduction of a hyperfine field at the Fe probe.

## II Experiment

A Ni_{0.98}Fe_{0.02} master alloy (Ni 99.9% and Fe 99.9%) was first melted in an induction furnace. Three 2.5-g ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}[11]B_{2}C_{0.99} polycrystalline samples labeled A, B, and C were prepared by melting proper amounts of Er (99.9%), ^{19} B (Eurisotop, 99.8% chemically pure, 97.5% isotopically enriched), carbon (99.7%), and of the Ni-Fe master alloy in an arc furnace under Ar atmosphere. ^{11}B isotope was used to reduce the neutron absorption caused by ^{10}B in natural boron. The resulting buttons were melted and flipped over several times to ensure a good homogeneity. Weight losses were less than 1%. The samples were annealed for 6 days at 1100 ^{\circ}C and subsequently characterized by powder x-ray diffraction and ac-susceptibility measurements. Last, they were ground to a fine powder and mixed together to make a \sim 7- g sample large enough to ensure a good neutron diffraction signal. Similarly a ErNi_{1.96}^{57}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.98} sample (labeled D) was specifically synthesized with ^{57}Fe for the Mossbauer spectroscopy measurements. Our samples were purposely melted with a carbon content slightly (1%-2%) below stoichiometry because it favors the reentrant behavior in zero applied field as already observed in HoNi_{2}B_{2}C_{y}.[33]

Powder x-ray diffraction (Bruker D8, Cu K\,\alpha radiation, Si NBS SRM640 as reference) showed that in each sample, ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} crystallizes in the LuNi_{2}B_{2}C structure type (space group I4/_mm_) with lattice parameters a = 3.501(1) A and c = 10.563(2) A in samples A - C and a = 3.501(1) and c = 10.560(2) in sample D. Here 3% ErB_{2}C_{2} and 1% Er_{2}Ni_{3}B_{6} were detected as impurity phases in samples A - C and sample D, respectively. Electron probe microanalysis performed on other ErNi_{2-x}Fe_{x}B_{2}C samples (x = 0.04, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) showed that iron is uniformly distributed in the matrix and that it follows a solid-solution behavior in this concentration range.

ac-susceptibility measurements were performed on a homebuilt system with an amplitude of \sim 1 Oe applied field at 331 Hz. Resistivity was measured using a four-probe setup in applied dc current mode (j = 20 A/cm^{2}).

Magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed in a commercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design) under 500 Oe after zero-field cooling.

Specific heat measurements were carried out on a home-made semidiabatic heat-pulse-type calorimeter.

Mossbauer measurements were made using a ^{57}Co:Rh source mounted on a triangular velocity drive in the temperature range 4.2-8 K. The isomer shift measured with this source must be shifted by 0.114 mm/s to obtain values with respect to the standard \alpha-Fe.

The neutron experiment was performed at the Laboratoire Leon Brillouin (CEA-CNRS, Saclay) using the two-axis multidetector G4.1 diffractometer with \lambda = 2.427 A and 7^{\circ} \leq 2 \theta\leq87^{\circ}. The sample was held in a vanadium can (R = 4 mm) and placed in a He cryostat. Neutron powder diffractograms were acquired as a function of temperature in the [1.4-10 K] range. Rietveld refinements of the nuclear and magnetic structures were performed with the help of the program fullprof.[34] The nuclear scattering lengths published by Sears[35] were used and the neutron linear absorption coefficient was computed (\mu_R_ = 1.5). The scale factors, the lattice parameters a and c, the Lorentzian peak broadening caused by the finite coherence length (Thomson-Cox-Hastings peak profile[36]), the magnetic moments, and propagation vectors were refined parameters. The boron z coordinate, the Gaussian instrumental peak broadening parameters, the site occupation factors, and the thermal displacement parameters were held fixed.

## III Results and Discussion

### a. ac-susceptibility, resistivity, and specific heat measurements

We have shown in a recent work on ErNi_{2-x}Fe_{x}B_{2}C (x<0.2) (Ref. [37]) that substitution on the Ni site by Fe  strongly decreases T_{c} at an average rate of dT_{c}/dx = - 100 K/mol(Fe). Diminution of the density of states [N(\varepsilon)] at the Fermi level (\varepsilon_{f}) appears to be the main reason for this T_{c} depression because the smaller electron density (Fe has two electrons fewer than Ni) shifts the Fermi level away from the maximum of N(\varepsilon) nearly attained in the pure compound.[38, 39, 40] The real part of the normalized ac susceptibility (\chi^{\prime}_{\rm ac}) measured on our three ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} samples is plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 1. The three curves are nearly identical. The decrease of \chi^{\prime}_{\rm ac} at T_{c} = 7.3 K (onset) corresponds to the superconducting transition, which occurs at 10.5 K in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C. Here \chi^{\prime}_{\rm ac} increases at 5.7 K and diminishes again at 5.5 K. Therefore, ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} partially reenters the normal state at 5.7 K and regains superconductivity at 5.5 K. The effect is reproducible and its magnitude compares well with what was observed in ErNi_{1.93}C_{0.065}B_{2}C.[28] Approximately 50% of the samples (by volume) is not superconducting at 5.5 K. The resistivity curve plotted in the inset of Fig. 1 was measured on sample C. Its behavior correlates with features seen in the \chi^{\prime}_{\rm ac}(T) curves, although most likely a difference of calibration of the thermometers causes a small temperature shift (- 0.1 K) relative to the \chi^{\prime}_{\rm ac}(T) curves. Sample D also displays a resistivity curve very similar to the curve of sample C with a local maximum, although less pronounced, at 5.4 K. All these experimental data demonstrate that ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} is at least partially a reentrant superconductor between 5.5 and 5.7 K in zero aplied field.

From magnetic susceptibility measurements, we obtained an antiferromagnetic ordering temperature T_{\rm N}= 5.9\pm 0.2 K for ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99}.[37] This shows that for x(Fe) < 0.05, T_{\rm N} weakly depends on x(Fe) (T_{\rm N}= 6 K in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C). Here, we present in Fig. 2 specific heat measurements (H= 0) as a function of temperature [C_{p}(T)] in ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} which confirm this view. A large peak corresponding to the antiferromagnetic transition and a shoulder corresponding to the weak ferromagnetic transition are clearly seen at, respectively, T_{\rm N}= 5.7\pm 0.2 K and T_{\rm WFM} = 2.2\pm 0.2 K (see arrows in Fig. 2). Magnetic susceptibility measurements on ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}^{11}B_{2}C_{0.99} also displays a large peak at 2.2 K (see the inset of Fig. 2) and confirm that iron doping does not smear off the weak ferromagnetic transition. The specific heat change associated with the superconducting transition at 7.3 K is not seen in our data because the magnetic contribution to C_{p} is still very high at T_{c}. No other magnetic transition could be detected either by magnetic susceptibility or specific heat measurements.

### Neutron diffraction measurements

Portions of the experimental diffraction patterns of ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} obtained at 10.0, 6.0, and 1.4 K are plotted in Fig. 3. At 10 K, only the nuclear peaks are visible and our Rietveld refinement confirms the x-ray diffraction results--i.e., that ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} adopts the LuNi_{2}B_{2}C structure type (_14_/_mmm_). Magnetic peaks are already visible at 8 K and fully develop between 6 and 7 K. They can easily be indexed at T= 6.0 K by the wave vector **q**= 0.566**a* or equivalently by **q**= 0.566**b*. Third-order peaks (3**q**) and fifth-order peaks (5**q**) can also be observed respectively below \sim 5 and \sim 3 K. Higher orders were observed in single-crystalline ErNi_{2}B_{2}C,[20] but were not detected in our case. Neither even-order peaks corresponding to the weak ferromagnetic structure (T_{\rm WFM}= 2.2 K) nor intensity changes of the nuclear peaks could be observed in the scanned temperature range [1.4-10 K]. As the 2**q** peaks are an order of magnitude smaller than the 3**q** peaks,[27] they are obviously beyond the detection limit of the G4.1 diffractometer. The magnetic peaks intensity are well fitted by a transverse sine-wave structure with **m\parallelb** (or equivalently **q\parallelb*** and **m\parallela**) adopted by the Er^{3+} ions. Attempts to model the magnetic peaks intensity with a Er^{3+} helimagnetic structure [**q**= 0.566**a*, **m\parallel(b, **c**)] resulted in reliability factors

  multiplied by a factor of 2. Refinements involving a small moment on the Ni/Fe site showed that it is zero within experimental error. The occurrence of third and fifth harmonics when temperature is lowered below 5.2 K corresponds to a squaring of the sine wave. No other magnetic structure was observed in the explored temperature range [1.4-10 K].

Figure 4 shows the good quality Rietveld refinement (_Rp_ = 5.1%) obtained on the 1.4-K pattern. Six contributions to the pattern were taken into account: the ErNi1.96Fe0.04B2C0.99 nuclear and magnetic phases (**q** = 0.559**a*, 3**q**, and 5**q**) and the nuclear and antiferromagnetic contributions of the secondary phase (3%) ErB2C2 (_T_N = 13 K).41 Compared to room-temperature values, the a lattice parameter of ErNi1.96Fe0.04B2C0.99 decreases from 3.500 to 3.497 A and 1.4 K and the c lattice parameter increases from 10.563 to 10.567 A. The lattice parameters are constant in the temperature range [1.4-10 K]. The propagation vector **q** = 0.559**a* is very close to the 0.553**a* value found in the works of Zarestky _et al._20 and of Lynn _et al._17 both on ErNi2B2C. These small differences could be accounted for by changes in the electronic structure at the Fermi level caused by the Fe doping as this modulated structure with **q**~(0.5-0.6)**a* present in several _R_Ni2B2C (_R_ = Gd, Tb, Er, Ho, Tm) compounds is attributed to a nesting of the Fermi surface.23 The magnitude at 1.4 K of the three Fourier components of the Er3+ moments are m1 = 10.4(1)_m_B, m3 = 3.4(1)_m_B, and m5 = 1.9(1)_m_B. The ratios m3 /_m_1 = 0.33 and m5 /_m_1 = 0.18 are close to the 1/3 and 1/5 ratio expected for a perfectly squared structure. Making this assumption at 1.4 K, these Fourier components would correspond to a squared moment of ~8.2_m_B. The same value was found in a previous 166Er Mossbauer spectroscopy study of ErNi2B2C,42 and it is also very similar to the 8_m_B found by Zarestky _et al._20 It is, however, larger than the 7.2_m_B found by Lynn _et al._17,19 but this discrepancy may be well accounted for by small composition differences such as the carbon content which has been shown to be very influential on the value of the magnetic moment of the rare earth in the _R_Ni2B2C series.33,43 The high degree of similarity between the characteristic parameters of the two magnetic structures observed in ErNi1.96Fe0.04B2C0.99 and ErNi2B2C lets us conclude that both are nearly identical. The effect of Fe doping on the magnetic parameters of ErNi2B2C is very weak: **q** only is slightly affected while the other parameters remain constant. Superconductivity is more drastically affected.

Figure 5(a) shows the evolution with temperature of the magnetic integrated intensities of the peaks indexed (000) + **q** and (101) - **q**, the (200) - 3**q** peak, and the (301) - 5**q** peak respectively labeled _I_**q**, I3**q**, and I5**q**. Of course, as expected, the three components increase when the temperature decreases. A power law fit of _I_**q** between 1.4 and 5.8 K yields _T_N = 5.9 +- 0.2 K. This _T_N value is identical to the 5.9 K derived from magnetic susceptibility measurements and very close to the 5.7 K obtained from our _C_p(_T_) experiment. _T_N = 5.9 K (Ref. 20) and _T_N = 6.0 K (Ref. 21) were previously determined by neutron diffraction experiments in ErNi2B2C. This confirms that _T_N weakly depends on Fe doping in this "low-concentration" range. Above 5.9 K, pretransitional scattering is observed at least up to 8 K. Here I3**q** and I5**q** respectively develop below 5.2 K and 3.6 K. However, these two components might already exist just above these temperatures, as their diffraction peaks are initially small and broad and might lay below the detection limit of our experiment. As already mentioned, refinements showed that the structure is nearly fully squared at 1.4 K.

The temperature variations of the magnitude of the propagation vector (**q**) are plotted in Fig. 5(b). It significantly varies (- 1.4%) in the scanned temperature range. Above 7 K,

The top six sets of small vertical lines correspond to the Bragg positions of the six contributions to the pattern. From top to bottom: ErNi1.96Fe0.04B2C0.99 nuclear and magnetic phases (**q** = 0.559**a*, 3**q**, and 5**q**) and ErB2C2 (3%) nuclear and antiferromagnetic phases. The bottom line is the difference between experience and calculation. _Rp_ = 5.1%.

  it is difficult to attribute a sign to its variations as **q** rather fluctuates around a mean value (0.566|**a*|). Between 7 and 2.2 K, it decreases with temperature from 0.566|**a*| to 0.558|**a*|. Below 2.2 K, it remains constant or slightly increases. At 5 K (**q**=0.565|**a*|) a change of slope is noticeable. Although the absolute values are slightly different, this temperature dependence is very similar to what was observed by Choi _et al._ in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C.[21] A mean-field model involving spin-slip structures explains these thermal variations of the modulation vector in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C.[44] It could most probably also be applied in the present case.

From the Lorentzian broadening of the magnetic first-order peaks (Y in radians), a magnetic coherence length (\xi_{m}) can be deduced using the following equation: \xi_{m} = 2\lambda/\pi Y. It is also plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 5(b) and its variations are also instructive as they are qualitatively very similar to the variations of I_{\bf q}. Between 8 and ~6.5 K, in the preorder regime, it increases slower than between ~6.5 and 5.6-5.8 K where the long-range magnetic order develops. Below 5.6-5.8 K, \xi_{m} increases until T_{\rm WFM} = 2.2 K where it decreases. The maximum value of \xi_{m} at T_{\rm WFM} is not caused by a limited instrumental resolution but is intrinsic. On the contrary, the nuclear peaks width is limited by the instrumental resolution and it is impossible to extract a nuclear coherence length and to compare it with the magnetic coherence length. I_{\bf q}(T) also seems to level off below 2.2 K as it is smaller than expected from the power law fit and a reverse effect is seen in the {\bf q}(T) curve which reaches a minimum or a plateau at T_{\rm WFM}. Similar effects can also be noticed at T_{\rm WFM} in the I_{\bf q}(T) and {\bf q}(T) data published by Choi _et al.[21]_ in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C. Therefore, our neutron diffraction measurements indirectly show that ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.01}B_{2}C_{0.99} undergoes a transition to weak ferromagnetism.

### ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy

The ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectra in ErNi_{1.96}^{57}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.98} , recorded between 4.2 and 8 K show no thermal variation. In particular, no line broadening is observed in this temperature range, showing that any transferred hyperfine field at the Fe probe in the reentrant region (5 < T < 6 K) is smaller than 2 kOe. Figure 6 shows that the spectra consist of two quadrupolar doublets: the dominant one (75% relative intensity) has an isomer shift of 0.06 mm/s with respect to \alpha-Fe and a small quadrupolar splitting of 0.15 mm/s. It most probably corresponds to Fe substituted at the Ni site. The minority component (25%) has an isomer shift of 0.38 mm/s and a larger quadrupolar splitting of 0.35 mm/s. Past Er, Tm, and Fe Mossbauer studies of RNi_{2}B_{2}C compounds showed the presence of a minority component in the spectra.[42, 43, 45, 46] This component is most likely originating from distorted Fe or rare-earth sites close to carbon vacancies[42, 43] which affect the crystalline electric field. Our sample is indeed carbon deficient (0.98). Our data seem to contradict the result of Ref. [45], where a small hyperfine field (~3 kOe) was reported in the reentrant region [5 - 6 K] of HoNi_{1.98}Fe_{0.02}B_{2}C, unless the transferred field in ErNi_{1.96}^{57}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.98} is smaller than 2 kOe. Our result is, however, consistent with what we reported in HoNi_{1.99}Fe_{0.01}B_{2}C (Ref. [46]) and what was obtained in ErNi_{1.98}Fe_{0.02}B_{2}C by authors of Ref. [45]: in both cases, no transferred field was observed. We conclude that a reentrant behavior in zero applied field can be observed while no transferred field can be detected at the Ni/Fe site.

### Discussion

The \chi_{\rm ac}^{\prime}(T) curve of sample A is also plotted in Fig. 5 to allow correlation between the reentrant behavior and the thermal variations of the microscopic magnetic parameters in ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99}. The superconducting order parameter starts increasing (T_{c} = 7.3 K) in the critical scattering regime between 8 K and T_{\rm N} = 5.9 K where I_{\rm q} and \xi_{m} slowly increase. This temperature range most likely corresponds to short-range magnetic ordering of the material but one cannot exclude long-range-ordered magnetic regions spread in a dominantly paramagnetic material. This question is of course intimately linked to the problem of determining the order of the magnetic transition in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C and ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} which according to us remains open. Past neutron studies [17, 19, 20] of ErNi_{2}B_{2}C did not reveal any thermal hysteresis of the magnetic intensities. This would lead us to conclude that the transition is of second order type. However, our ^{166}Er Mossbauer spectroscopy work on ErNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [42]) gave strong support to a first-order transition. Either superconductivity develops in already short-range-ordered regions or only in paramagnetic regions spatially separated from the magnetically ordered region of the material. It is therefore difficult to conclude whether the magnetic structure is detrimental or not to superconductivity in the critical scattering regime. At T_{\rm N} = 5.9 K, I_{\rm q} increases faster and the **a**-modulated magnetic structure grows. This nearly coincides with the beginning of the reentrant behavior at 5.7 K. There is also a clear correlation with the variations of \xi_{m}(T) which saturates at 5.6 K. Hence, the **a***-modulated magnetic structure is detrimental to the superconductivity in the temperature range 5.5-5.7 K. Several models [10, 47] predict that in a antiferromagnetic superconductor, the depression of the electron-phonon coupling parameter (\lambda) is proportional to the magnetic order parameter (m): \lambda^{\prime} = [1 - const \times m(T)]. These models can explain how below T_{\rm N}, the rapidly growing m depresses \lambda enough to drive the system, at least partially, back to a normal state. However, one has to be cautious because these models based on a mean-field theory are used in a temperature range close to T_{\rm N} where critical phenomena are certainly at work. Below 5.5 K, superconductivity reappears because the superconducting order parameter keeps on increasing while the magnetic order parameter begins to saturate. Indeed, the magnetic moment derived from our data is already 6.7\mu_{\rm B}/Er at 5.5 K (8.2\mu_{\rm B}/Er at 1.4 K) and \xi_{m}(T) does not increase anymore. This implies that although the transverse **a**-modulated magnetic structure is detrimental to superconductivity, its magnetic pair-breaking energy obviously becomes smaller below 5.5 K than the superconducting condensation energy and it coexists with superconductivity. In ErNi_{2}B_{2}C, H_{c2}(T) is most probably much larger (20 kOe at 2 K) than in ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} and no signature of the magnetic transition is visible in ac-susceptibility or resistivity measurements in low magnetic field. However, as already described in the Introduction, H_{c1}(T) and H_{c2}(T) curves of ErNi_{2}B_{2}C are also depressed just below T_{\rm N} by the transverse modulated structure which remains pair breaking even at lower temperature. Consequently, H_{c2} never recovers to the value of the nonmagnetic reference compound LuNi_{2}B_{2}C (80 kOe at 2 K). [48] This contradicts previous results which had concluded that the transverse modulated structure is not detrimental [20] to superconductivity in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C.

## IV Conclusion

We showed that ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} is a reentrant superconductor in zero applied field. Parts of the sample reenters the normal state between 5.5 and 5.7 K. The Er^{3+} magnetic moments adopt below T_{\rm N} = 5.9 K the same structure as in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C, i.e., a transverse modulated structure (**q**=0.559**a***), which squares at lower temperature and transforms to weak ferromagnetism below T_{\rm WFM} = 2.2 K. This antiferromagnetic ordering is at the origin of the reentrant behavior below T_{\rm N} and is detrimental to superconductivity even at lower temperature, despite their coexistence. No transferred field was detected at the Ni/Fe site in the reentrant temperature region.

###### Abstract

ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} is superconducting at T_{c} = 7.3 K and is shown to partially reenter the normal state between 5.5 and 5.7 K in zero applied field by means of ac-susceptibility (\chi_{\rm av}^{\prime}) and resistivity measurements. Specific heat (C_{p}) measurements give a magnetic ordering temperature T_{\rm N} = 5.7 \pm 0.2 K. Powder neutron diffraction measurements showed that the Er^{3+} magnetic moments adopt below T_{\rm N} = 5.9 \pm 0.2 K a transverse modulated structure along the a axis (**q**=0.559**a*). Observation of third-order and fifth-order harmonics indicates a squaring of the structure at lower temperature (8.2 \mu_{\rm B} at 1.4 K). Although even-order peaks could not be detected in the neutron data, a weak ferromagnetic transition at T_{\rm WFM} = 2.2 K could be directly evidenced by magnetic susceptibility measurements and C_{p} measurements and indirectly evidenced in the thermal variations of the intensity of the first-order magnetic peaks (I_{\rm q}), the magnetic coherence length (\xi_{\rm av}), and the magnetic wave vector (**q**). The magnetic structure of ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} is nearly identical to that of the parent compound ErNi_{2}B_{2}C. Precise comparison between the temperature variations of I_{\rm q}, \xi_{\rm av}, and \chi_{\rm av}^{\prime} shows that the transverse **a***-modulated magnetic structure is responsible for the reentrant behavior between 5.5 and 5.7 K. Although it is still pair breaking below 5.5 K, it coexists with superconductivity. ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectra display no broadening in the temperature range where the reentrant behavior is observed, showing that the transferred hyperfine field at the Fe site, if any, is smaller than 2 kOe.

## I Introduction

Four of the rare-earth (_R_) nickel-borocarbides _R_Ni_{2}B_{2}C (_R_ = Dy, Ho, Er, Tm (Ref. 1)) exhibit coexistence of a magnetic order with superconductivity. The magnetic moments originate from the localized 4f electrons of the rare earth, and they are exchange coupled by the RKKY interaction mediated by the conduction electrons. Many experiments have shown the interaction of superconductivity with the rare-earth-ordered sublattice in these compounds. One of its most dramatic manifestation is the local minimum observed close to the Neel temperature _T_N in the upper critical field H_{c2}(T) curve of HoNi_{2}B_{2}C, [1, 2, 3, 4] ErNi_{2}B_{2}C, [5, 6] and TmNi_{2}B_{2}C. [7] This effect is obviously related to the onset of magnetic order but the detailed mechanism is not yet fully understood.

In HoNi_{2}B_{2}C (T_{c} = 8.5 _K_), the minimum is attributed to the competition between superconductivity and a magnetic helical structure (**q**=0.915**c* (Refs. 8-10)) or to a partially determined magnetic structure (**q**=0.585**a*, moment orientation unknown (Refs. 11-13)), or to both structures (Refs. 3 and 14), as they are both observed in the 5-6K temperature region where H_{c2} is depressed. Below 5 K the Ho^{3+} moments adopt a commensurate antiferromagnetic structure and H_{c2} increases again. Depending on the samples, a small magnetic field ranging from 0 to 700 Oe can drive this compound reentrant: it becomes superconducting at 8.5 K, reenters the normal state at 6 K, and superconductivity appears again at 5 K. [1, 2, 3, 4]

TmNi_{2}B_{2}C (T_{c} = 11 _K_) exhibits below 1.5 K a transverse sine-wave structure with **q**=0.094(**a*+**b*) in zero applied field. [15, 16, 17] In an applied field H = 0.9 T parallel to **a**, this low-field structure transforms into a new structure with **q**=0.48**a* (Ref. 18) which is stable at least up to H = H_{c2}(0 _K_) = 2 T. This high-field structure is potentially responsible for the depression of H_{c2}(T) in TmNi_{2}B_{2}C below \sim 2 K.

ErNi_{2}B_{2}C becomes superconducting at T_{c} = 10.5 K and the Er^{3+} moments adopt a transverse sine-wave structure [**q**=0.553**a*, **m**[**b**] at T_{\rm N} = 6 K. [19, 20, 21, 22] An incommensurate magnetic structure with **q**=0.4-0.6**a* is a common feature of these three magnetic _R_Ni_{2}B_{2}C compounds and is caused by a nesting of their Fermi surface at this **q** vector. [23] Single-crystal measurements in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C (Refs. 5 and 6) with an applied field H parallel to the **c** axis have shown that H_{c2}(T) sharply decreases at 6 K (from 16 to 14 kOe for the best  samples) and starts increasing again at 5.5 K [H_{c2}(2\,K) = 20 kOe]. This effect is anisotropic because for _H_II(**a**,**b**), H_{c2}(T) only exhibits an inflection point around 5 K. A similar feature is also observed in the lower-critical field H_{c1}(T) curve.[24, 25] The magnetic structure undergoes a transition from antiferromagnetism to weak ferromagnetism at T_{\rm WFM} = 2.3 K,[21, 26] which causes an increase of critical current due to enhanced pinning of the flux line lattice.[27]

Although superconductivity is more "robust" in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C than in HoNi_{2}B_{2}C, a reentrant behavior can be observed in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C by applying a field larger than \sim 11 kOe.[5] Thus a direct and precise comparison between H_{c2}(T) in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C and neutron magnetic diffraction data usually obtained in zero applied field is difficult: T_{\rm N} depends on the applied field in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C,[5] and even worse, in the case of TmNi_{2}B_{2}C this would be misleading, as the zero-field magnetic structure is not the existing structure at H_{c2}. One way to overcome this difficulty is to depress globally the H_{c2}(T) curve until its local minimum crosses the T axis and one observes a reentrant behavior in zero applied field. Of course, T_{c} is simutaneously depressed. This was obtained by Schmidt and Braun in HoNi_{2}B_{2}C and in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [28]) by substituting cobalt on the nickel site: HoNi_{1.99}Co_{0.01}B_{2}C and ErNi_{1.993}Co_{0.065}Ni_{2}B_{2}C both exhibit reentrant superconductivity in zero applied field. Although magnetic neutron diffraction measurements were reported on nonsuperconducting HoNi_{1.988}Co_{0.015}B_{2}C,[29, 30] no result was reported on the two above-mentioned reentrant compounds.

Iron doping also depresses T_{c} of the _R_Ni_{2}B_{2}C compounds,[28, 31, 32] and it was expected that, similarly to cobalt, it would depress H_{c2} and induce reentrant superconductivity in zero applied field in ErNi_{2-x}Fe_{x}B_{2}C. Therefore, we report in this paper that ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} is a reentrant superconductor (T_{c} = 7.3 K, T_{\rm N}= 5.9 K, T_{\rm WFM}= 2.2 K) in zero applied field. As the determination of the magnetic structures of ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} of high interest to look for correlations with its exotic superconducting properties, we carried out neutron powder diffraction. Accordingly, we also performed ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy measurements to examine if the magnetic structure present in the reentrant region leads to the introduction of a hyperfine field at the Fe probe.

## II Experiment

A Ni_{0.98}Fe_{0.02} master alloy (Ni 99.9% and Fe 99.9%) was first melted in an induction furnace. Three 2.5-g ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}[11]B_{2}C_{0.99} polycrystalline samples labeled A, B, and C were prepared by melting proper amounts of Er (99.9%), ^{19} B (Eurisotop, 99.8% chemically pure, 97.5% isotopically enriched), carbon (99.7%), and of the Ni-Fe master alloy in an arc furnace under Ar atmosphere. ^{11}B isotope was used to reduce the neutron absorption caused by ^{10}B in natural boron. The resulting buttons were melted and flipped over several times to ensure a good homogeneity. Weight losses were less than 1%. The samples were annealed for 6 days at 1100 ^{\circ}C and subsequently characterized by powder x-ray diffraction and ac-susceptibility measurements. Last, they were ground to a fine powder and mixed together to make a \sim 7- g sample large enough to ensure a good neutron diffraction signal. Similarly a ErNi_{1.96}^{57}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.98} sample (labeled D) was specifically synthesized with ^{57}Fe for the Mossbauer spectroscopy measurements. Our samples were purposely melted with a carbon content slightly (1%-2%) below stoichiometry because it favors the reentrant behavior in zero applied field as already observed in HoNi_{2}B_{2}C_{y}.[33]

Powder x-ray diffraction (Bruker D8, Cu K\,\alpha radiation, Si NBS SRM640 as reference) showed that in each sample, ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} crystallizes in the LuNi_{2}B_{2}C structure type (space group I4/_mm_) with lattice parameters a = 3.501(1) A and c = 10.563(2) A in samples A - C and a = 3.501(1) and c = 10.560(2) in sample D. Here 3% ErB_{2}C_{2} and 1% Er_{2}Ni_{3}B_{6} were detected as impurity phases in samples A - C and sample D, respectively. Electron probe microanalysis performed on other ErNi_{2-x}Fe_{x}B_{2}C samples (x = 0.04, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) showed that iron is uniformly distributed in the matrix and that it follows a solid-solution behavior in this concentration range.

ac-susceptibility measurements were performed on a homebuilt system with an amplitude of \sim 1 Oe applied field at 331 Hz. Resistivity was measured using a four-probe setup in applied dc current mode (j = 20 A/cm^{2}).

Magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed in a commercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design) under 500 Oe after zero-field cooling.

Specific heat measurements were carried out on a home-made semidiabatic heat-pulse-type calorimeter.

Mossbauer measurements were made using a ^{57}Co:Rh source mounted on a triangular velocity drive in the temperature range 4.2-8 K. The isomer shift measured with this source must be shifted by 0.114 mm/s to obtain values with respect to the standard \alpha-Fe.

The neutron experiment was performed at the Laboratoire Leon Brillouin (CEA-CNRS, Saclay) using the two-axis multidetector G4.1 diffractometer with \lambda = 2.427 A and 7^{\circ} \leq 2 \theta\leq87^{\circ}. The sample was held in a vanadium can (R = 4 mm) and placed in a He cryostat. Neutron powder diffractograms were acquired as a function of temperature in the [1.4-10 K] range. Rietveld refinements of the nuclear and magnetic structures were performed with the help of the program fullprof.[34] The nuclear scattering lengths published by Sears[35] were used and the neutron linear absorption coefficient was computed (\mu_R_ = 1.5). The scale factors, the lattice parameters a and c, the Lorentzian peak broadening caused by the finite coherence length (Thomson-Cox-Hastings peak profile[36]), the magnetic moments, and propagation vectors were refined parameters. The boron z coordinate, the Gaussian instrumental peak broadening parameters, the site occupation factors, and the thermal displacement parameters were held fixed.

## III Results and Discussion

### a. ac-susceptibility, resistivity, and specific heat measurements

We have shown in a recent work on ErNi_{2-x}Fe_{x}B_{2}C (x<0.2) (Ref. [37]) that substitution on the Ni site by Fe  strongly decreases T_{c} at an average rate of dT_{c}/dx = - 100 K/mol(Fe). Diminution of the density of states [N(\varepsilon)] at the Fermi level (\varepsilon_{f}) appears to be the main reason for this T_{c} depression because the smaller electron density (Fe has two electrons fewer than Ni) shifts the Fermi level away from the maximum of N(\varepsilon) nearly attained in the pure compound.[38, 39, 40] The real part of the normalized ac susceptibility (\chi^{\prime}_{\rm ac}) measured on our three ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} samples is plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 1. The three curves are nearly identical. The decrease of \chi^{\prime}_{\rm ac} at T_{c} = 7.3 K (onset) corresponds to the superconducting transition, which occurs at 10.5 K in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C. Here \chi^{\prime}_{\rm ac} increases at 5.7 K and diminishes again at 5.5 K. Therefore, ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} partially reenters the normal state at 5.7 K and regains superconductivity at 5.5 K. The effect is reproducible and its magnitude compares well with what was observed in ErNi_{1.93}C_{0.065}B_{2}C.[28] Approximately 50% of the samples (by volume) is not superconducting at 5.5 K. The resistivity curve plotted in the inset of Fig. 1 was measured on sample C. Its behavior correlates with features seen in the \chi^{\prime}_{\rm ac}(T) curves, although most likely a difference of calibration of the thermometers causes a small temperature shift (- 0.1 K) relative to the \chi^{\prime}_{\rm ac}(T) curves. Sample D also displays a resistivity curve very similar to the curve of sample C with a local maximum, although less pronounced, at 5.4 K. All these experimental data demonstrate that ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} is at least partially a reentrant superconductor between 5.5 and 5.7 K in zero aplied field.

From magnetic susceptibility measurements, we obtained an antiferromagnetic ordering temperature T_{\rm N}= 5.9\pm 0.2 K for ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99}.[37] This shows that for x(Fe) < 0.05, T_{\rm N} weakly depends on x(Fe) (T_{\rm N}= 6 K in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C). Here, we present in Fig. 2 specific heat measurements (H= 0) as a function of temperature [C_{p}(T)] in ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} which confirm this view. A large peak corresponding to the antiferromagnetic transition and a shoulder corresponding to the weak ferromagnetic transition are clearly seen at, respectively, T_{\rm N}= 5.7\pm 0.2 K and T_{\rm WFM} = 2.2\pm 0.2 K (see arrows in Fig. 2). Magnetic susceptibility measurements on ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}^{11}B_{2}C_{0.99} also displays a large peak at 2.2 K (see the inset of Fig. 2) and confirm that iron doping does not smear off the weak ferromagnetic transition. The specific heat change associated with the superconducting transition at 7.3 K is not seen in our data because the magnetic contribution to C_{p} is still very high at T_{c}. No other magnetic transition could be detected either by magnetic susceptibility or specific heat measurements.

### Neutron diffraction measurements

Portions of the experimental diffraction patterns of ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} obtained at 10.0, 6.0, and 1.4 K are plotted in Fig. 3. At 10 K, only the nuclear peaks are visible and our Rietveld refinement confirms the x-ray diffraction results--i.e., that ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} adopts the LuNi_{2}B_{2}C structure type (_14_/_mmm_). Magnetic peaks are already visible at 8 K and fully develop between 6 and 7 K. They can easily be indexed at T= 6.0 K by the wave vector **q**= 0.566**a* or equivalently by **q**= 0.566**b*. Third-order peaks (3**q**) and fifth-order peaks (5**q**) can also be observed respectively below \sim 5 and \sim 3 K. Higher orders were observed in single-crystalline ErNi_{2}B_{2}C,[20] but were not detected in our case. Neither even-order peaks corresponding to the weak ferromagnetic structure (T_{\rm WFM}= 2.2 K) nor intensity changes of the nuclear peaks could be observed in the scanned temperature range [1.4-10 K]. As the 2**q** peaks are an order of magnitude smaller than the 3**q** peaks,[27] they are obviously beyond the detection limit of the G4.1 diffractometer. The magnetic peaks intensity are well fitted by a transverse sine-wave structure with **m\parallelb** (or equivalently **q\parallelb*** and **m\parallela**) adopted by the Er^{3+} ions. Attempts to model the magnetic peaks intensity with a Er^{3+} helimagnetic structure [**q**= 0.566**a*, **m\parallel(b, **c**)] resulted in reliability factors

  multiplied by a factor of 2. Refinements involving a small moment on the Ni/Fe site showed that it is zero within experimental error. The occurrence of third and fifth harmonics when temperature is lowered below 5.2 K corresponds to a squaring of the sine wave. No other magnetic structure was observed in the explored temperature range [1.4-10 K].

Figure 4 shows the good quality Rietveld refinement (_Rp_ = 5.1%) obtained on the 1.4-K pattern. Six contributions to the pattern were taken into account: the ErNi1.96Fe0.04B2C0.99 nuclear and magnetic phases (**q** = 0.559**a*, 3**q**, and 5**q**) and the nuclear and antiferromagnetic contributions of the secondary phase (3%) ErB2C2 (_T_N = 13 K).41 Compared to room-temperature values, the a lattice parameter of ErNi1.96Fe0.04B2C0.99 decreases from 3.500 to 3.497 A and 1.4 K and the c lattice parameter increases from 10.563 to 10.567 A. The lattice parameters are constant in the temperature range [1.4-10 K]. The propagation vector **q** = 0.559**a* is very close to the 0.553**a* value found in the works of Zarestky _et al._20 and of Lynn _et al._17 both on ErNi2B2C. These small differences could be accounted for by changes in the electronic structure at the Fermi level caused by the Fe doping as this modulated structure with **q**~(0.5-0.6)**a* present in several _R_Ni2B2C (_R_ = Gd, Tb, Er, Ho, Tm) compounds is attributed to a nesting of the Fermi surface.23 The magnitude at 1.4 K of the three Fourier components of the Er3+ moments are m1 = 10.4(1)_m_B, m3 = 3.4(1)_m_B, and m5 = 1.9(1)_m_B. The ratios m3 /_m_1 = 0.33 and m5 /_m_1 = 0.18 are close to the 1/3 and 1/5 ratio expected for a perfectly squared structure. Making this assumption at 1.4 K, these Fourier components would correspond to a squared moment of ~8.2_m_B. The same value was found in a previous 166Er Mossbauer spectroscopy study of ErNi2B2C,42 and it is also very similar to the 8_m_B found by Zarestky _et al._20 It is, however, larger than the 7.2_m_B found by Lynn _et al._17,19 but this discrepancy may be well accounted for by small composition differences such as the carbon content which has been shown to be very influential on the value of the magnetic moment of the rare earth in the _R_Ni2B2C series.33,43 The high degree of similarity between the characteristic parameters of the two magnetic structures observed in ErNi1.96Fe0.04B2C0.99 and ErNi2B2C lets us conclude that both are nearly identical. The effect of Fe doping on the magnetic parameters of ErNi2B2C is very weak: **q** only is slightly affected while the other parameters remain constant. Superconductivity is more drastically affected.

Figure 5(a) shows the evolution with temperature of the magnetic integrated intensities of the peaks indexed (000) + **q** and (101) - **q**, the (200) - 3**q** peak, and the (301) - 5**q** peak respectively labeled _I_**q**, I3**q**, and I5**q**. Of course, as expected, the three components increase when the temperature decreases. A power law fit of _I_**q** between 1.4 and 5.8 K yields _T_N = 5.9 +- 0.2 K. This _T_N value is identical to the 5.9 K derived from magnetic susceptibility measurements and very close to the 5.7 K obtained from our _C_p(_T_) experiment. _T_N = 5.9 K (Ref. 20) and _T_N = 6.0 K (Ref. 21) were previously determined by neutron diffraction experiments in ErNi2B2C. This confirms that _T_N weakly depends on Fe doping in this "low-concentration" range. Above 5.9 K, pretransitional scattering is observed at least up to 8 K. Here I3**q** and I5**q** respectively develop below 5.2 K and 3.6 K. However, these two components might already exist just above these temperatures, as their diffraction peaks are initially small and broad and might lay below the detection limit of our experiment. As already mentioned, refinements showed that the structure is nearly fully squared at 1.4 K.

The temperature variations of the magnitude of the propagation vector (**q**) are plotted in Fig. 5(b). It significantly varies (- 1.4%) in the scanned temperature range. Above 7 K,

The top six sets of small vertical lines correspond to the Bragg positions of the six contributions to the pattern. From top to bottom: ErNi1.96Fe0.04B2C0.99 nuclear and magnetic phases (**q** = 0.559**a*, 3**q**, and 5**q**) and ErB2C2 (3%) nuclear and antiferromagnetic phases. The bottom line is the difference between experience and calculation. _Rp_ = 5.1%.

  it is difficult to attribute a sign to its variations as **q** rather fluctuates around a mean value (0.566|**a*|). Between 7 and 2.2 K, it decreases with temperature from 0.566|**a*| to 0.558|**a*|. Below 2.2 K, it remains constant or slightly increases. At 5 K (**q**=0.565|**a*|) a change of slope is noticeable. Although the absolute values are slightly different, this temperature dependence is very similar to what was observed by Choi _et al._ in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C.[21] A mean-field model involving spin-slip structures explains these thermal variations of the modulation vector in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C.[44] It could most probably also be applied in the present case.

From the Lorentzian broadening of the magnetic first-order peaks (Y in radians), a magnetic coherence length (\xi_{m}) can be deduced using the following equation: \xi_{m} = 2\lambda/\pi Y. It is also plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 5(b) and its variations are also instructive as they are qualitatively very similar to the variations of I_{\bf q}. Between 8 and ~6.5 K, in the preorder regime, it increases slower than between ~6.5 and 5.6-5.8 K where the long-range magnetic order develops. Below 5.6-5.8 K, \xi_{m} increases until T_{\rm WFM} = 2.2 K where it decreases. The maximum value of \xi_{m} at T_{\rm WFM} is not caused by a limited instrumental resolution but is intrinsic. On the contrary, the nuclear peaks width is limited by the instrumental resolution and it is impossible to extract a nuclear coherence length and to compare it with the magnetic coherence length. I_{\bf q}(T) also seems to level off below 2.2 K as it is smaller than expected from the power law fit and a reverse effect is seen in the {\bf q}(T) curve which reaches a minimum or a plateau at T_{\rm WFM}. Similar effects can also be noticed at T_{\rm WFM} in the I_{\bf q}(T) and {\bf q}(T) data published by Choi _et al.[21]_ in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C. Therefore, our neutron diffraction measurements indirectly show that ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.01}B_{2}C_{0.99} undergoes a transition to weak ferromagnetism.

### ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy

The ^{57}Fe Mossbauer spectra in ErNi_{1.96}^{57}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.98} , recorded between 4.2 and 8 K show no thermal variation. In particular, no line broadening is observed in this temperature range, showing that any transferred hyperfine field at the Fe probe in the reentrant region (5 < T < 6 K) is smaller than 2 kOe. Figure 6 shows that the spectra consist of two quadrupolar doublets: the dominant one (75% relative intensity) has an isomer shift of 0.06 mm/s with respect to \alpha-Fe and a small quadrupolar splitting of 0.15 mm/s. It most probably corresponds to Fe substituted at the Ni site. The minority component (25%) has an isomer shift of 0.38 mm/s and a larger quadrupolar splitting of 0.35 mm/s. Past Er, Tm, and Fe Mossbauer studies of RNi_{2}B_{2}C compounds showed the presence of a minority component in the spectra.[42, 43, 45, 46] This component is most likely originating from distorted Fe or rare-earth sites close to carbon vacancies[42, 43] which affect the crystalline electric field. Our sample is indeed carbon deficient (0.98). Our data seem to contradict the result of Ref. [45], where a small hyperfine field (~3 kOe) was reported in the reentrant region [5 - 6 K] of HoNi_{1.98}Fe_{0.02}B_{2}C, unless the transferred field in ErNi_{1.96}^{57}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.98} is smaller than 2 kOe. Our result is, however, consistent with what we reported in HoNi_{1.99}Fe_{0.01}B_{2}C (Ref. [46]) and what was obtained in ErNi_{1.98}Fe_{0.02}B_{2}C by authors of Ref. [45]: in both cases, no transferred field was observed. We conclude that a reentrant behavior in zero applied field can be observed while no transferred field can be detected at the Ni/Fe site.

### Discussion

The \chi_{\rm ac}^{\prime}(T) curve of sample A is also plotted in Fig. 5 to allow correlation between the reentrant behavior and the thermal variations of the microscopic magnetic parameters in ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99}. The superconducting order parameter starts increasing (T_{c} = 7.3 K) in the critical scattering regime between 8 K and T_{\rm N} = 5.9 K where I_{\rm q} and \xi_{m} slowly increase. This temperature range most likely corresponds to short-range magnetic ordering of the material but one cannot exclude long-range-ordered magnetic regions spread in a dominantly paramagnetic material. This question is of course intimately linked to the problem of determining the order of the magnetic transition in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C and ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} which according to us remains open. Past neutron studies [17, 19, 20] of ErNi_{2}B_{2}C did not reveal any thermal hysteresis of the magnetic intensities. This would lead us to conclude that the transition is of second order type. However, our ^{166}Er Mossbauer spectroscopy work on ErNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [42]) gave strong support to a first-order transition. Either superconductivity develops in already short-range-ordered regions or only in paramagnetic regions spatially separated from the magnetically ordered region of the material. It is therefore difficult to conclude whether the magnetic structure is detrimental or not to superconductivity in the critical scattering regime. At T_{\rm N} = 5.9 K, I_{\rm q} increases faster and the **a**-modulated magnetic structure grows. This nearly coincides with the beginning of the reentrant behavior at 5.7 K. There is also a clear correlation with the variations of \xi_{m}(T) which saturates at 5.6 K. Hence, the **a***-modulated magnetic structure is detrimental to the superconductivity in the temperature range 5.5-5.7 K. Several models [10, 47] predict that in a antiferromagnetic superconductor, the depression of the electron-phonon coupling parameter (\lambda) is proportional to the magnetic order parameter (m): \lambda^{\prime} = [1 - const \times m(T)]. These models can explain how below T_{\rm N}, the rapidly growing m depresses \lambda enough to drive the system, at least partially, back to a normal state. However, one has to be cautious because these models based on a mean-field theory are used in a temperature range close to T_{\rm N} where critical phenomena are certainly at work. Below 5.5 K, superconductivity reappears because the superconducting order parameter keeps on increasing while the magnetic order parameter begins to saturate. Indeed, the magnetic moment derived from our data is already 6.7\mu_{\rm B}/Er at 5.5 K (8.2\mu_{\rm B}/Er at 1.4 K) and \xi_{m}(T) does not increase anymore. This implies that although the transverse **a**-modulated magnetic structure is detrimental to superconductivity, its magnetic pair-breaking energy obviously becomes smaller below 5.5 K than the superconducting condensation energy and it coexists with superconductivity. In ErNi_{2}B_{2}C, H_{c2}(T) is most probably much larger (20 kOe at 2 K) than in ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} and no signature of the magnetic transition is visible in ac-susceptibility or resistivity measurements in low magnetic field. However, as already described in the Introduction, H_{c1}(T) and H_{c2}(T) curves of ErNi_{2}B_{2}C are also depressed just below T_{\rm N} by the transverse modulated structure which remains pair breaking even at lower temperature. Consequently, H_{c2} never recovers to the value of the nonmagnetic reference compound LuNi_{2}B_{2}C (80 kOe at 2 K). [48] This contradicts previous results which had concluded that the transverse modulated structure is not detrimental [20] to superconductivity in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C.

## IV Conclusion

We showed that ErNi_{1.96}Fe_{0.04}B_{2}C_{0.99} is a reentrant superconductor in zero applied field. Parts of the sample reenters the normal state between 5.5 and 5.7 K. The Er^{3+} magnetic moments adopt below T_{\rm N} = 5.9 K the same structure as in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C, i.e., a transverse modulated structure (**q**=0.559**a***), which squares at lower temperature and transforms to weak ferromagnetism below T_{\rm WFM} = 2.2 K. This antiferromagnetic ordering is at the origin of the reentrant behavior below T_{\rm N} and is detrimental to superconductivity even at lower temperature, despite their coexistence. No transferred field was detected at the Ni/Fe site in the reentrant temperature region.
