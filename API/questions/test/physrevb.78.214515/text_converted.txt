###### Abstract

Single crystalline samples of Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ with x < 0.12
have been grown and characterized via microscopic, thermodynamic, and
transport measurements. With increasing Co substitution, the
thermodynamic and transport signatures of the structural
(high-temperature tetragonal to low-temperature orthorhombic) and
magnetic (high-temperature nonmagnetic to low-temperature
antiferromagnetic) transitions are suppressed at a rate of roughly 15 K/

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in F-doped LaFeAsO (Ref. [1]) and
K-doped BaFe₂As₂ (Ref. [2]) compounds has lead to an extensive
experimental effort to characterize and delineate the nature of
superconductivity in RFeAsO and (AE)Fe₂As₂ materials (R=rare earth;
AE=Ba,Sr,Ca). Currently the availability of single crystalline samples
of significant size and quality [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] has made the study
of the doped (AE)Fe₂As₂ compounds more tractable. This, combined with
the realization that Co substitution for Fe could be used to both
stabilize superconductivity [9, 10] and simplify growth while improving
homogeneity, makes the systematic study of the thermodynamic and
transport properties of the Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ series particularly
compelling. So far only a limited set of data on the
Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ series: the effect of pressure on phase
transitions in Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ with x = 0.04 and 0.1, [12]
anisotropic H_(c2) in Ba(Fe_(0.9)Co_(0.1))₂As₂ (Ref. [13]), and details
of superconducting state for Ba(Fe_(0.93)Co_(0.07))₂As₂ (Refs. [14] and
[15]) have been reported.

In this work we combine detailed measurements of the low-field
thermodynamic and transport properties of single crystalline
Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ with high-field measurements (up to 35 T) of
the anisotropic upper superconducting critical field, H_(c2)(T). The
analysis of these data allows us to create a T-x phase diagram and shows
that the superconductivity apparently occurs in both the low-temperature
orthorhombic and tetragonal phases, an observation that is clearly
reflected in significant differences in the anisotropy of H_(c2) in
these two regions.

## II Experimental methods

Single crystals of Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ were grown out of self-flux
using conventional high-temperature solution growth techniques. [9, 16]
Small Ba chunks, FeAs powder, and CoAs powder were mixed together
according to the ratio Ba:FeAs:CoAs=1:4(1-_x_):4x. The mixture was
placed into an alumina crucible. A second catch crucible containing
quartz wool was placed on top of this growth crucible and both were
sealed in a quartz tube under ∼1/3 atm Ar gas. The sealed quartz tube
was heated up to 1180 ^(∘)C, stayed at 1180 ^(∘)C for 2 h, and then
cooled to 1000 ^(∘)C over 36 h. To avoid cracking of the crucible, a 50
^(∘)C/h heating rate was used. Once the furnace reached 1000 ^(∘)C, the
excess of FeAs/CoAs was decanted from the platelike single crystals. The
inset of Fig. 2 (below) shows a picture of a single crystal of
Ba(Fe_(0.926)Co_(0.074))₂As₂ ($x_{\rm nominal}$=0.10) against a
millimeter scale. Unlike the crystals grown out of Sn flux, [3, 5, 6] it
does not have clear (100) facets although the plate itself is
perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis. Single crystal dimension
can go up to 12 x 8 x 0.8 mm³.

The FeAs and CoAs powders used as part of the self-flux were synthesized
by reacting Fe or Co powder and As powder after they were mixed together
and pressed into pellets. The pellets were sealed inside a quartz tube
under 1/3 atm Ar gas, slowly heated up to 500 ^(∘)C, kept at 500 ^(∘)C
for 10 h, and then slowly heated up to 900 ^(∘)C, and then kept at 900
^(∘)C for the other 10 h.

Powder x-ray measurements, with Si standard, were performed on a Rigaku
Miniflex diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at room temperature. The
lattice parameters were refined by "untitcell" software. [17] The error
bars are taken as ± 2σ. Elemental analysis of the samples was performed
using wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDS) in the electron
probe microanalyzer of a JEOL JXA-8200 electron-microprobe. Heat
capacity data were collected using a Quantum Design (QD) Physical
Property Measurement System (PPMS). Magnetization and
temperature-dependent ac (f =16 Hz, I=3 mA) electrical transport data
were collected by a QD Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS).
Electrical contacts were made to the sample using Epotek H20E silver
epoxy to attach Pt wires in a four-probe configuration. The typical
samples for electrical transport had ap proximately 0.1 x 0.5 mm² cross
section and the distance between the voltage contacts is  1 mm.

Whereas the single crystals could be cut and cleaved into well-defined
geometries, we found that the values of resistivity we inferred from
these samples could vary significantly. Figure 1(a) presents data from
three samples of Ba(Fe_(0.926)Co_(0.074))₂As₂. There is a clear
difference between the three ρ(T) plots but the basic features are also
very similar, as well as the characteristic temperatures. If we assume
that cracks or exfoliations internal to the sample are responsible for
these differences (effectively leading to errors in the geometric
factor), then normalizing the room-temperature slopes,
$d\rho/dT|_{300~{}\rm K}$, should compensate for this. Figure 1(b)
confirms this assumption and Fig. 1(c) shows that allowing for slightly
different residual resistivity scattering, ρ₀, collapses the three
curves onto each other. Unfortunately as we change the amount of Co
substitution, we cannot use such a simple normalization since dρ/dT may
easily be dependent on Co-substitution levels. For this reason we will
present our data in terms of $\rho(T)/\rho(300~{}\rm K)$ [or
equivalently $R(T)/R(300~{}\rm K)$] when we compare different
Co-substitution levels.

Field-dependent dc electrical transport data were collected using the 35
and 33 T resistive magnets in the National High Magnetic Field
Laboratory (NHMFL) in Tallahassee, FL for superconducting members of the
series. Two samples with each nominal concentration of Co were run, each
for H∥c and H parallel to the basal plane (shown throughout the text as
H⊥c). Each of these samples was measured in zero field in the QD PPMS
and MPMS units, and the zero field T_(c) was used to correct for slight
temperature offsets associated with the resistive probe used at the
NHMFL. These shifts were systematic (associated with the sample position
relative to the thermometer) and were at most 10

## III Results

In order to present the data in terms of actual x rather than
$x_{\rm nominal}$, elemental analysis was performed using WDS. The
average inferred x value was determined by averaging the x value
measured at several locations on the sample. For example, the cobalt
substitution level for the $x_{\rm nominal}$=0.10 was measured to be
0.072, 0.070, and 0.073 on three different layers of a crystal from one
batch, and 0.076, 0.076, and 0.075 on three different layers of a
crystal from a different batch, leading to an average inferred
substitution level of 0.074. As shown in Fig. 2, there is a finite but
limited spread of measured Co concentrations. In addition, there is a
well defined essentially linear relation between nominal and actual Co
concentrations in the samples over the range of substitution we studied
($x_{\rm WDS}$=0.74$x_{\rm nominal}$). Figure 2 also shows that the
unit-cell volume follows an essentially linear dependence on Co
concentration. To this end, the unit-cell volume at room temperature can
be used to estimate the Co-doping levels from simple powder x-ray
diffraction. For this work, the inferred Co values will be used to
identify the samples.

The unit-cell volume data shown in Fig. 2 was determined via powder
x-ray diffraction patterns taken on ground single crystals from each
batch. No impurity phases could be detected and the tetragonal unit-cell
parameters, a and c, could be readily inferred. These are plotted in
Fig. 3 as relative changes in lattice parameter. There is a clear,
monotonic, and essentially linear decrease in the a- and c-lattice
parameters as well as the unit-cell volume up to x ∼ 0.12.

The effects of Co substitution on the low-temperature properties of
Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ crystals can be clearly seen in transport data
(Fig. 4). For BaFe₂As₂, x=0.00, the sharp decrease in resistivity
associated with the combined structural and antiferromagnetic
transitions [18, 19] is clearly seen at 134 K. As x is increased the
temperature of the resistive anomaly is suppressed monotonically, no
longer being detectable for x > 0.058. For x ≥ 0.038 superconductivity
is readily detected by a sharp (and complete) decrease in the
resistivity to zero. This is shown more clearly in the inset of Fig. 4.
For x=0.038, 0.047, and even 0.058, both the higher temperature,
resistive anomaly, and superconductivity are detected. It is worth
noting that even our lowest Co-substitution level, x=0.013, causes a
complete change in sign of the resistive feature; the resistivity
increases below the high-temperature transition rather than decreasing.
Whereas for x=0.013 and 0.020 the resistive anomaly is very reminiscent
of that seen for pure CaFe₂As₂, [6, 7, 8] for x=0.038 and 0.047, the
resistive anomaly is very similar to that originally found for BaFe₂As₂
grown out of Sn flux [3] (i.e., when ∼1

Both the antiferromagnetic/structural phase transition as well as the
superconductivity can also be detected in temperature-dependent
magnetization measurements. Figure 5 presents the M/H data for H=1 T
applied perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis of the samples. For
0.00 ≤ x ≤ 0.047 (upper panel) there is a clear drop in the
susceptibility at the temperature associated with the resistive
anomalies (as well as a lower temperature feature associated with
superconductivity for x=0.038 and 0.047). For larger x values (lower
panel of Fig. 5) superconductivity can be observed but there is no
longer any signature of the higher temperature transition. The
superconducting transition can be seen more clearly in the low-field M/H
data shown in Fig. 6. Each data set has been converted into units of
1/4 π by using the unit-cell volume and inferred Co-doping level from
the data presented in Fig. 3. The upper curves are field cooled

data whereas the lower curves are zero-field-cooled-warming data.

Specific-heat data (H=0 and 9 T applied along the crystallographic c
axis) was measured for Co-doping levels of x=0.038 and 0.047 (Fig. 7) as
well as for x=0.074 and 0.10 (Fig. 8). For x=0.038 two breaks in slope
can be seen at higher temperatures. These can be more clearly identified
by examining the dC_(p)/dT plot in the lower inset. A similar pair of
features can also be seen for the x=0.047 data. A lower temperature
feature in the specific heat can be clearly seen near the T_(c) values
identified from the resistivity and susceptibility data shown in Figs.
4-6. These features are even more clearly resolved by comparison with
the 9 T data. Figure 8 presents the low-temperature C_(p)(T) data for
x=0.074 and 0.10 samples. For x=0.074 (upper panel of Fig. 8) the
specific-heat anomaly is relatively sharp and readily associated with a
second-order phase transition to a low-temperature superconducting
state. For other x values, low-temperature anomalies associated with the
superconducting phase transition are broader and will be discussed in
detail below.

The resistivity, susceptibility, and specific-heat data all clearly show
the suppression of the higher temperature phase transition [associated
with a structural and antiferromagnetic phase transition in BaFe₂As₂
(Refs. [3, 18, 19]) with increasing Co substitution for Fe. In order to
quantify this more fully, we have to introduce criterion for determining
the salient transition temperatures. For x≤0.020 a single transition is
clearly identifiable in both resistivity and magnetization but for
higher x values, the transition appears to broaden and possibly even
split. Figure 9 shows the temperature derivatives of the specific heat,
resistivity, and susceptibility for x=0.038. Clear features in the
resistivity and susceptibility occur at the similar temperatures as the
breaks in slope in the specific heat. (Similar features in the
temperature derivatives of resistivity at ambient and hydrostatic
pressure were observed in Refs. [12] and [20] as well.) Transition
temperature data inferred in this manner are plotted as a T-x phase
diagram in Fig. 10. In a similar manner criteria for the determination
of T_(c) have to be established and used. For this study we use: (i) an
offset criterion for resis

at which the maximum slope of the resistivity curve extrapolates to zero
resistance), (ii) an onset criterion for susceptibility (the temperature
at which the maximum slope of the susceptibility extrapolates to the
normal-state susceptibility), and (iii) the temperature at which the
zero-field specific heat deviates from the 9 T specific heat. The data
points inferred from these criteria are shown in Fig. 10 as well.

Figure 10 presents a summary of the microscopic, thermodynamic, and
transport data presented so far in the form of a temperature-doping
phase diagram. The higher temperature phase transition that is
associated with a structural/antiferromagnetic transition is
monotonically suppressed with increasing Co substitution and is no
longer detected in either resistivity or magnetization data for x >
0.058. Superconductivity is stabilized for x = 0.038, rises to a maximum
value (_Tc_   23 K) for 0.058 <= x <= 0.074, and drops to _Tc_   10 K
again by x = 0.11. Whereas the resistive and, perhaps more importantly,
the magnetic signatures of superconductivity are sharp, the feature
associated with superconductivity in specific heat was only sharp for
the sample with near maximum _Tc_. It is important to note that the
transition temperatures inferred from resistivity data (squares),
magnetization data (circles), and specific-heat data (triangles) are in
excellent agreement with each other.

One of the clearest features in Fig. 10, as well as the resistivity and
magnetization data shown in Figs. 4 and 5, is the apparent coexistence
of the higher temperature structural (antiferromagnetic) phase
transition with lower temperature superconductivity for the lower
Co-doping levels. This could imply that superconductivity does exist in
the low-temperature orthorhombic (and presumably antiferromagnetic)
state. This of course presumes that the same parts of the sample are
simultaneously superconducting and orthorhombic. Another possibility
would be that the sample separates into tetragonal (superconducting) and
orthorhombic (not superconducting) phases.

In order to study the effects of doping on the superconductivity in
greater detail, anisotropic _Hc_2(_T_) data were collected for two
samples for each doping level that manifested superconductivity. A
representative data set of _R_(_H_) data for H |_c_ and H | c, and x =
0.038 is shown in Fig. 11. The two criteria that were used to infer
_Hc_2 from a given _R_(_H_) curve: onset and offset, are shown in Fig.
11. These two criteria are representative of the width of the transition
seen in the _R_(_H_) data and will give a sense of the range of possible
_Hc_2(_T_) values. Figures 12-17 present the anisotropic _Hc_2(_T_)
plots inferred from the _R_(_H_) data for each criterion. The _Hc_2(_T_)
data manifest several trends, some trivial and some more profound. In
the Ba(Fe1-xCo3)2As2 series, grossly speaking, the _Hc_2(_T_) curves
become higher for higher _Tc_ values. Whereas, for the samples with
lower _Tc_ values the 35 T maximum field was enough to fully determine
the _Hc_2(_T_) plots, the samples with _Tc_ values above 20 K have
_Hc_2(_T_ = 0) values that are significantly larger. The _Hc_2
anisotropy appears to be significantly smaller than that in
superconducting oxypnictides [21-24] but for all values of x, the
_Hc_2(_T_) curve for H | c is higher than that for H |_c_. In addition,
for all values of x close to _Tc_, the upper H | c curve is closer to
linear than the H |_c_ curve which manifests an increasing (negative)
slope as T is reduced. The close to linear _Hc_2(_T_) not far from _Tc_
is reminiscent to the standard WHH (Ref. 25) behavior, whereas a
positive curvature of _Hc_2(_T_) is sometimes considered a hallmark of
multiband super

transitions (first order and, at low x, coincidence of structural and
magnetic transitions) is beyond the conditions used in Ref. 11.

conductivity.[26] These differences in H_(c2)(T) behavior may possibly
be accounted for by complex multisheet Fermi surfaces of these materials
but detailed realistic modeling based on band-structure calculations are
required to address this issue. The sign and the order of magnitude of
the H_(c2) anisotropy, as well as difference in curvature of H_(c2)(T)
for two different orientations, are similar to that observed in K-doped
BaFe₂As₂ (Refs. [27] and [28]) as well as to data taken on nominal 10

## IV Discussion

The temperature-composition phase diagram shown in Fig. 10 summarizes
the features of the Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ series: substitution of Co
for Fe suppresses the high-temperature tetragonal-to-orthorhombic (as
well as paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic) phase transition, completely
suppressing it for x > 0.06. In addition for x ≥ 0.038, and up through
our highest doping level of x = 0.114, superconductivity can be
stabilized, with a broad maximum, with T_(c) ∼ 23 K for x ∼ 0.07. (A
grossly similar phase diagram with superconductivity possibly emerging
still in orthorhombic/magnetic phase was reported for
Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂,[29, 30] although with no evidence for split
structural/magnetic transition.) Several questions about the details and
implications of this phase diagram immediately arise: what can be
inferred from the broadened (or split) transitions found for interme

diate Co concentrations, and what can be inferred about the coexistence
of superconductivity and the orthorhombic (antiferromagnetic) phase?

The observation of two clear features in dρ/dT as well as dχ/dT, coupled
with features in C_(p) for intermediate Co concentrations, can be
discussed within two very different frameworks: a separation of the
structural and magnetic phase transitions that are so strongly coupled
for x=0 [not only in BaFe₂As₂ but, for example, in CaFe₂As₂ (Ref. [31]),
or a distribution of transition temperatures associated with a
distribution of Co doping throughout the sample. The first hypothesis is
certainly an exciting one but, unfortunately, the current data set
cannot do more than address it peripherally.

If the two phase transitions (structural and magnetic) were to separate
cleanly, then there would be no reason for the broadened features in the
resistivity as well as the somewhat subtle features in the specific
heat. If there indeed is a separation of the magnetic and structural
phase transitions, then there also has to be some broadening of them as
well (as inferred from these data). The second hypothesis is somewhat
more supported by the current data. Figure 10 shows a roughly 15 K
decrease in the upper transition temperature for each percent of Co
substituted. If we associate the two features we observe in the
resistivity as well as in the susceptibility with a range of transition
temperatures associated with the variation in Co content in the sample,
then we can infer that for increasing Co substitution there may be a
range of doping as large as ±0.005. This is comparable (within a factor
of 2) to the variation in inferred WDS stoichiometry discussed in Sec.
II. This hypothesis also allows for an understanding of the initially
puzzling variation in the specific-heat feature associated with the
superconducting transition. Figures 7 and 8 indicate that for x=0.074
there is a relatively sharp C_(p) anomaly but for other x the feature is
broadened. If there is a distribution of Co concentrations throughout
the sample, then this distribution will lead to a distribution of T_(c)
values that can be evaluated by looking at the local curvature of the
T_(c)(x) dome. For the low x or high x side of the dome, there is a
clear slope and this will lead to a relatively large distribution of
T_(c) values. On the other hand, for x values near the optimal x value
(the one giving the highest T_(c)) a distribution of x values will lead
to a negligible spread in T_(c). This is consistent with what we can
infer from the C_(p)(T) data.

The T-x phase diagram presented in Fig. 10 raises another question
concerning the homogeneity of the sample: if at T_(c) the sample is
assumed to be single phased [i.e., completely in the orthorhombic
(antiferromagnetic) phase], then Fig. 10 clearly shows that
superconductivity exists in either phase (orthorhombic and tetragonal)
with apparent equal ease. The alternate to this scenario is to assume
that parts of the sample

remain in the tetragonal state and these parts are the ones that become
superconducting at low temperatures. Some light can be shed on this
hypothesis by examining how the properties of the superconducting state
vary from one side of the dome to the other. If the superconductivity is
associated solely with the tetragonal phase, volume fraction of the
sample, then there should not be a dramatic variation in the anisotropy
of the superconductivity (all coming from the tetragonal phase). On the
other hand, if there is a clear difference in the superconducting
anisotropy between the samples that are in the orthorhombic part of the
phase diagram and the samples that are in the tetragonal part of the
phase diagram, then this would be evidence of the superconductivity
being affected by the higher temperature phase transition. Figure 18
presents the anisotropy of H_(c2)(T), γ
=$H_{c2}^{\perp c}(T)/H_{c2}^{\rm c}(T)$, plotted as a function of
T/T_(c). The data for each of the two samples from each batch are shown,
as well as the two different criteria. There is a remarkable bifurcation
of anisotropy with the three Co-doping values, which are clearly in the
tetragonal state, having an anisotropy that is 40

## V V. Summary and conclusions

The effects of Co substitution for Fe have been studied in single
crystals of Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ for x < 0.12. The addition of Co
monotonically suppresses the higher temperature structural
(antiferromagnetic) phase transition at an initial rate of roughly 15 K/

The T-x phase diagram inferred for Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ clearly
shows the existence of superconductivity in the orthorhombic
(antiferromagnetic) phase. Although this may be a manifestation of the
material breaking into superconducting (tetragonal) and
nonsuperconducting (orthorhombic) regions, the analysis of the H_(c2)
anisotropy clearly shows that the superconductivity that occurs in
samples that show features associated with the transition to the
low-temperature orthorhombic state has an ∼50
