###### Abstract

Alkali-metal-intercalated FeSe materials, (NH3)3/_M_0.4FeSe (_M_: K, Rb, and Cs), have been synthesized using the liquid NH3 technique. (NH3)3/Cs0.4FeSe shows a superconducting transition temperature (_T_c) as high as 31.2 K, which is higher by 3.8 K than the _T_c of nonammoniated Cs0.4FeSe. The _T_c of (NH3)3/K0.4FeSe and (NH3)3/Rb0.4FeSe are almost the same as those of nonammoniated K0.4FeSe and Rb0.4FeSe. The _T_c of (NH3)3/Cs0.4FeSe shows a negative pressure dependence. A clear correlation between _T_c and lattice constant \(c\) is found for ammoniated metal-intercalated FeSe materials, suggesting a correlation between Fermi-surface nesting and superconductivity.

Metal-intercalated FeSe superconductors are one of the most promising materials for high superconducting transition temperature (_T_c), since an onset _T_c (_T_c onset) as high as ~30 K was recently discovered in K\({}_{\text{x}}\)FeSe and Cs0.4FeSe.\({}^{1,2}\) Many metal-intercalated FeSe materials have recently been synthesized by dissolving metals (Li, Na, K, Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu, and Yb) in liquid NH3 containing _b_-FeSe, which intercalates the metal atoms into the FeSe crystals. The Na0.5FeSe sample prepared using the liquid NH3 described above showed a very high _T_c onset (46 K).\({}^{3}\) These materials must contain NH3 between the FeSe layers, because their lattice constant \(c\) is expanded by at least 2.1 A.\({}^{1,3}\)

Thus, diverse metal-intercalated FeSe materials have been synthesized using liquid NH3. The structure of metal-intercalated FeSe containing NH3 was clarified by Rietveld refinement of the neutron powder diffraction pattern of Li0.6(1)(ND2)0.2(1)(ND3)0.8(1)Fe2Se2,\({}^{4}\) showing the ND3 to be surrounded by Li atoms to form the planar layer. This report demonstrates that a precise amount of NH3 is incorporated in metal-intercalated FeSe containing NH3.\({}^{4}\) Recently, two phases of (NH3)3/KxFeSe were systematically investigated:\({}^{5}\) (NH3)0.235K0.15FeSe with _T_c onset = 44 K and (NH3)0.185K0.3 FeSe with _T_c onset = 30 K. These two phases are isostructural, but the \(c\) (15.56 A) of the former phase is larger than the \(c\) (14.84 A) of the latter. The \(c\) of 14.84 A in the latter structure is still larger than that [_c_ = 14.0367(6) A] in nonammoniated K0.5FeSe (_T_c onset of ~30 K).

In this paper, we report on the syntheses and physical properties of (NH3)3/_M_x FeSe (_M_: K, Rb and Cs), which were prepared using liquid NH3. The synthesis of these materials is important because of a lack of systematic studies on superconductivity in alkali-metal-intercalated FeSe. When the _T_c obtained in this and earlier studies\({}^{3,-}\) are plotted as a function of ionic radius and the lattice constant \(c\), a clear correlation between _T_c and \(c\) can be seen. Such plots are important to clarify a key parameter in this class of superconductors. Furthermore, we report on the pressure dependence of _T_c in (NH3)3/_M_x FeSe and on pressure effect on superconductivity in (NH3)3/_M_x FeSe. The study of pressure effect is important to establish the correlation between _T_c and \(c\), i.e., to pursue whether the lattice constant \(c\) is a universal scaling factor for explaining the superconductivity.

The _b_-FeSe sample was prepared with the annealing method; details are described in the supplemental material.\({}^{6}\) The x-ray diffraction and magnetic susceptibility, \(\textbf{M}/H\), of the prepared _b_-FeSe were measured and compared with previous reports\({}^{7}\) to confirm the sample quality; \(\textbf{M}\) and \(H\) correspond to magnetization and applied magnetic field, respectively. The samples of (NH3)3/_M_x FeSe were prepared by the liquid NH3 technique; details are described in the Supplemental Material.\({}^{6}\)

The x-ray diffraction and \(\textbf{M}/H\) of the (NH3)3/_M_x FeSe samples were measured with synchrotron radiation [\(\lambda\) = 0.400 45(1) A] at BL02B2 of the Super Photon ring-8 (SPring-8) and a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS2), respectively. The unit-cell parameters were determined by Rietveld refinement;\({}^{8}\) crystallographic data, including atomic coordinates and fraction of phases, are listed in the Supplemental Material.\({}^{6}\) The resistance \(R\) of the samples was recorded in standard four-terminal measurement mode with a He-flow cryostat regulated by a temperature controller (Oxford Instrument ITC503). The electric current \(I\) was supplied by a Keithley 220 programmable current source, and the voltage was measured by a Keithley nanovoltmeter 2182. The real part \(\chi\)\({}^{\prime}\) of the alternating current (ac) magnetic susceptibility\({}^{9}\) and the \(\textbf{M}/H\) under high pressure were measured using the Hartshorn bridge method\({}^{9}\) and the above SQUID magnetometer, respectively. For high-pressure ac susceptibility measurement, the sample was introduced into an indenter cell, while the sample was introduced into a piston-cylinder-type BeCu cell for high-pressure \(\textbf{M}/H\) measurement with the SQUID. All measurements were performed without any exposure of the samples to air. Throughout this paper, chemical formulas are written using the experimental nominal values.

Figure 1(a) shows the x-ray diffraction pattern of the prepared FeSe sample. The pattern was analyzed by Rietveld refinement with the crystal structure (tetragonal crystal and space group \(P4/nmm\)) reported previously.\({}^{7}\) The lattice constants were determined to be \(a\) = 3.771 79(4) and \(c\) = 5.5234(1) A, which are almost the same as those reported previously [\(a\) = 3.7747(1) and \(c\) = 5.5229(1) A].[7] From the analysis, it has been suggested that an \(\sim\)20% fraction of non-superconducting \(\alpha\)-FeSe is present, with 80% superconducting \(\beta\)-FeSe, in the sample; the crystallographic data are shown in the Supplemental Material.[6] The \(\bm{M}/H\) is recorded as a function of temperature \(T\) [Fig. 1(b)] in zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC). The \(\bm{M}/H\) clearly drops below 9 K (\(T_{\rm c}\)\({}^{\rm onset}\) = 9.0 K, \(T_{\rm c}\) = 8.2 K). The \(T_{\rm c}\)\({}^{\rm onset}\) and \(T_{\rm c}\) are the same as those of \(\beta\)-FeSe reported previously.[7] The shielding fraction was evaluated to be 92% at 5 K from the \(\bm{M}/H\)-\(T\) plot in ZFC mode, substantially consistent with the fraction (\(\sim\)80%) of \(\beta\)-FeSe determined from x-ray diffraction.

Figure 2(a) shows the x-ray diffraction pattern of (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm Y}\)Cs\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe. The x-ray diffraction peaks were analyzed by Rietveld refinement with the space group of \(\bm{14}/mmm\) (body-centered tetragonal crystal lattice) in the same manner as nonammoniated K\({}_{0.5}\)FeSe, which was prepared by the annealing method.[1] The crystal structure of (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm Y}\)Na\({}_{0.5}\)FeSe was analyzed with the same space group.[3] The lattice constants of (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm Y}\)Cs\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe were determined by the analysis to be \(a\) = 3.8331(1) A and \(c\) = 16.217(1) A (the crystallographic data are shown in the Supplemental Material),[6] which shows that this sample contains three phases of (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm Y}\)Cs\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe (37%), \(\beta\)-FeSe (37%), and \(\alpha\)-FeSe (26%). For this paper, we fully investigated the behavior of superconductivity in (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm Y}\)Cs\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe using this sample. Only a \(T_{\rm c}\) of the (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm Y}\)Cs\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe phase is selectively extracted and discussed in this paper. Furthermore, the Rietveld refinement suggests that the exact chemical composition of (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm Y}\)Cs\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe is (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm Y}\)Cs\({}_{0.255(55)}\)FeSe; i.e., the amount of Cs seems to be smaller than the nominal stoichiometry of Cs (0.4).

The \(a\) value [3.8331(1) A] for (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm Y}\)Cs\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe is a little larger than that determined for \(\beta\)-FeSe [3.7747(1) or 3.7734(1) A].[7] However, the \(a\) [3.8331(1) A] is a little smaller than those for nonammoniated K\({}_{0.5}\)FeSe [\(a\) = 3.9136(1) A]\({}^{1}\) and Cs\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe [\(a\) = 3.9601(2) A].[2] The \(c\) = 16.217(1) A of (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm Y}\)Cs\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe is larger than those for \(\beta\)-FeSe [\(c\) = 5.5234(1) x 2 = 11.0468(2) A or \(c\) = 5.5228(1) x 2 = 11.0456(2) A in Ref. 7], nonammoniated K\({}_{0.5}\)FeSe [\(c\) = 14.0367(7) A],[1] and nonammoniated Cs\({}_{0.5}\)FeSe [\(c\) = 15.2846(1) A].[2] The larger \(c\) [16.217(1) A] in (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm Y}\)Cs\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe implies that NH\({}_{3}\) molecules are intercalated in the space between FeSe layers; i.e., both Cs atoms and NH\({}_{3}\) molecules are intercalated between FeSe layers. The predicted structure is shown in Fig. 2(b), where NH\({}_{3}\) molecules are not drawn because their exact locations are not determined in this

  Rietveld refinement; a reliable location may not be determined from x-ray diffraction because of the small contribution of NH\({}_{3}\) (total number of electrons = 10) to x-ray scattering. Their exact location is determined only by neutron diffraction in Li\({}_{0.61(1)}\)(ND\({}_{2}\))\({}_{0.2(1)}\)(ND\({}_{3}\))\({}_{0.8(1)}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)Se\({}_{2}\).[4] From the analogy with Li\({}_{0.61(1)}\)(ND\({}_{2}\))\({}_{0.2(1)}\)(ND\({}_{3}\))\({}_{0.8(1)}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)Se\({}_{2}\), NH\({}_{3}\) should coordinate with a Cs atom in (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm Cs0.4}\)FeSe.

The \(\bm{M}/H\)-\(\bm{T}\) plots in ZFC and FC modes for (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm Cs0.4}\)FeSe are shown in Fig. 2(c). The \(T_{\rm c}\)\({}^{\rm onset}\) and \(T_{\rm c}\) were determined to be 33.6 and 31.2 K, respectively [see the detail of \(T_{\rm c}\) determination, Fig. 2(c) inset]. This \(T_{\rm c}\) (31.2 K) is higher by 3.8 K than that of nonammoniated Cs\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe (\(T_{\rm c}\) = 27.4 K).[2] The \(T_{\rm c}\) increases with the increase in \(c\) from 15.2846(1) to 16.217(1) A due to NH\({}_{3}\) insertion. The shielding fraction at 5 K was evaluated to be 31.2%, which is almost consistent with the fraction of (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm Cs0.4}\)FeSe determined from x-ray diffraction. The \(\bm{M}\)-\(\bm{H}\) curve of (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm Cs0.4}\)FeSe is shown in the Supplemental Material.[6] The lower critical field \(H_{\rm c1}\) was evaluated to be 30 Oe (see the Supplemental Material).[6] The resistivity \(\rho\) is plotted in Fig. 2(d) as a function of \(T\); \(\rho\) was evaluated from the measured \(\bm{R}\), channel length \(L\), channel width \(W\), and thickness \(\bm{d}\) of the pellet sample [Fig. 2(d)]. The \(T_{\rm c}\)\({}^{\rm onset}\) can be evaluated to be 36 K from the \(\rho\)-\(\bm{T}\) plot [Fig. 2(d)], which is higher than that determined from \(\bm{M}/H\)-\(\bm{T}\) plot [Fig. 2(c)]. The origin of the observed higher \(T_{\rm c}\)\({}^{\rm onset}\) is still unclear, and complete zero resistivity was not observed as in Na- and Ba-doped FeSe prepared by the liquid NH\({}_{3}\) method.[3] A small peak in \(\rho\) around \(T_{\rm c}\)\({}^{\rm onset}\) is seen in the \(\rho\)-\(\bm{T}\) plot [Fig. 2(d)], which is consistent with the \(\rho\)-\(\bm{T}\) plots reported for ammoniated Na\({}_{0.5}\)FeSe and Ba\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe. These features indicate that the same type of material as metal-intercalated FeSe compounds prepared previously using the NH\({}_{3}\) method[3] was synthesized in this paper.

Here, we discuss the nanometer-scale phase-separation (antiferromagnetic [AFM] order phase and superconductor phase) found in nonammoniated metal-intercalated FeSe samples.[10; 11] The small peak around \(T_{\rm c}\) is not observed in the \(\rho\)-\(\bm{T}\) plot of nanometer-scale phase-separated samples.[11] Therefore, the small peak does not imply the presence of nanometer-scale phase-separation in (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm Cs0.4}\)FeSe. However, a hump is observed at \(\sim\)200 K in \(\rho\)-\(\bm{T}\) plot of (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm Cs0.4}\)FeSe, in the same manner as nonammoniated \(M_{\rm x}\)FeSe smaleg.[11] The hump often disappears even in the nonammoniated samples containing both the superconducting phase and the AFM order phase, depending on sample preparation, i.e., on topological features of superconducting parts.[11] Therefore, the relationship between the hump and the nanometer-scale phase separation (presence of the AFM order phase) is still unclear. Because of study with a powder sample, we cannot comment on the presence of an AFM order phase in (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm Cs0.4}\)FeSe or a nanometer-scale phase separation. There are no other reports on the presence of an AFM order phase in (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm M}\)\({}_{\rm x}\)FeSe.

The pressure dependence of \(\chi^{\prime}\) of (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm Cs0.4}\)FeSe is plotted in Fig. 3(a). The \(T_{\rm c}\) is determined to be 31.8 K from the \(\chi^{\prime}\)-\(\bm{T}\) plot measured at ambient pressure. This value is almost consistent with that determined from \(\bm{M}/H\)-\(\bm{T}\) and \(\rho\)-\(\bm{T}\) plots [Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)]. The \(T_{\rm c}\) decreases with an increase in pressure \(\bm{P}\), as seen from Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). The \(T_{\rm c}\)-\(\bm{P}\) plot is shown in Fig. 3(b), where red circles indicate the \(T_{\rm c}\) determined from the \(\chi^{\prime}\)-\(\bm{T}\) plot [Fig. 3(a)]. The \(T_{\rm c}\) decreases with an increase in pressure up to 3.2 GPa. The fitted line is drawn in Fig. 3(b), and the \(dT_{\rm c}/\bm{d}p\) is evaluated from it to be \(-\) 4.33(8) K GPa\({}^{-1}\). In order to precisely investigate the pressure dependence of \(T_{\rm c}\), the \(\bm{M}/H\)-\(\bm{T}\) plot (not shown) was measured in the pressure range from ambient pressure to 0.83 GPa (low-pressure range). The \(T_{\rm c}\) determined from \(\bm{M}/H\)-\(\bm{T}\) is plotted with blue and green triangles in Fig. 3(b). As seen from Fig. 3(b), the triangle plots depart from the fitted line, showing a brief upward deviation. The deviation is more clearly shown in the inset of Fig. 3(b). The pressure dependence of \(T_{\rm c}\) for nonammoniated Cs\({}_{\rm x}\)FeSe in the low-pressure range of 0.0-1.7 GPa showed a clear peak at 0.8 GPa, and the maximum \(T_{\rm c}\) value was higher by \(\sim\)1 K than that at ambient pressure.[12] The \(T_{\rm c}\)-\(\bm{P}\) plot for (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{\rm y}\)\({}_{\rm Cs0.4}\)FeSe [Fig. 3(b) inset] does not show such a clear peak, but the brief upward deviation may be related to the \(T_{\rm c}\)-\(\bm{P}\) plot in nonammoniated Cs\({}_{\rm x}\)FeSe. Thus, we have investigated the pressure dependence of \(T_{\rm c}\) in ammoniated metal-intercalated FeSe in the pressure range up to 3.2 GPa. We clarified that the \(T_{\rm c}\) decreases monotonically

In (b), red circles indicate the \(T_{\rm c}\) determined from \(\chi^{\prime}\)-\(\bm{T}\) plot. Blue and green triangles indicate the \(T_{\rm c}\) from \(\bm{M}/H\)-\(\bm{T}\) plots measured in increasing and decreasing pressure, respectively. The line was fitted to the points, excluding the brief upward deviation enlarged in the inset, which shows data below 1 GPa in greater detail.

  in the high-pressure range but shows a brief elevation above linearity in the low-pressure range.

The \(\boldsymbol{M}\)/\(H\)-\(T\) curves of (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe and (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)Rb\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe are shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. The \(T_{\rm c}\)\({}^{\rm onset}\) and \(T_{\rm c}\) are 30.0 and 27.2 K, respectively, for (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe, compared with 31.0 and 29.9 K, respectively, for (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)Rb\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe. The 30.0-K \(T_{\rm c}\)\({}^{\rm onset}\) of the (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe prepared in this paper is the same as that of the (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe prepared previously.[3] Furthermore, the 30.0-K \(T_{\rm c}\)\({}^{\rm onset}\) of (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe is almost the same as the 31 K of nonammoniated K\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe.[1] The (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)Rb\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe sample was prepared in this paper. The 31.0-K \(T_{\rm c}\)\({}^{\rm onset}\) of (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)Rb\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe is almost the same as the 30.6 K of nonammoniated Rb\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe.[13] These results differ from those indicating that \(T_{\rm c}\) increases by 3.8 K (from 27.4 to 31.2 K) in the case of ammoniated Cs\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe. Since the expansion of \(c\) is confirmed (see the Supplemental Material),[6, 11] NH\({}_{3}\) molecules are intercalated in (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe and (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)Rb\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe. The small expansion of \(c\) in (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe may explain the absence of any change in \(T_{\rm c}\), but the reason the \(T_{\rm c}\) does not change in (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)Rb\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe is still unclear because of a significant expansion of \(c\).

Figure 4(c) shows the plots of \(T_{\rm c}\)\({}^{\rm onset}\) as a function of the ionic radii of the metal ions (\(M\)) in (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)\(M_{0.4}\)FeSe. The \(T_{\rm c}\) decreases rapidly with an increase in ionic radius. The \(T_{\rm c}\)\({}^{\rm onset}\) for (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)Li\({}_{0.5}\)FeSe is as high as 44 K,[3] and the \(T_{\rm c}\)\({}^{\rm onset}\) for (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)NaFeSe is 46 K,[3] while the \(T_{\rm c}\)\({}^{\rm onset}\) is the lowest (30 K) in (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe and increases slightly to 33.6 K in (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)Cs\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe. Thus, as evidenced in this paper, the insertion of K, Rb, and Cs, with larger ionic radii than the other metals, produces the lowest \(T_{\rm c}\)s in the (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)\(M_{0.4}\)FeSe system. Furthermore, as seen from Fig. 4(d), the \(T_{\rm c}\) clearly increases with an increase in \(c\), suggesting that an increase in two-dimensionality leads to an increase in \(T_{\rm c}\). Such a behavior is found in H\(\rm\ddot{u}\)NCI containing NH\({}_{3}\) and tetrahydrofuran molecules: When the plane spacing between H\(\rm\ddot{u}\)NCI layers increases, the \(T_{\rm c}\) rapidly increases and saturates.[14] In these materials, the maximum \(T_{\rm c}\) is observed when the spacing between layers increases up to 15 A because of an increase in nesting of the Fermi surface through a reduction of warping along the \(k_{\rm z}\) direction.[15, 16] The plane spacing of 8.716 A (\(c/2\)) in (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)NaFeSe produces the highest \(T_{\rm c}\) at the present stage. Furthermore, the insertion of metal atoms with smaller ionic radii leads to both the expansion of \(c\) (or plane spacing) and an increase in \(T_{\rm c}\) [Figs. 4(c) and 4(d)]. This implies a difference in the coordination structure of NH\({}_{3}\) with individual metal atoms or in the number of NH\({}_{3}\) molecules coordinating with each metal atom. In other words, the coordination of NH\({}_{3}\) molecules around Cs does not result in an expanded structure, while Li or Na may produce a larger coordination structure with NH\({}_{3}\). These results are interesting in that coordination chemistry controls the \(T_{\rm c}\) in this system. Thus, an increase in plane spacing between FeSe layers is important for the realization of high \(T_{\rm c}\) in (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)\(M_{\rm x}\)FeSe, suggesting a clear correlation between an increase in two-dimensionality (or an increase in nesting of the Fermi surface) and superconductivity. This result may be interpreted as meaning that a spin-density wave (SDW) ground state with weak magnetic moments can stimulate the superconducting transition, as evidenced in NaFe\({}_{1-\rm x}\)Co\({}_{\rm x}\)As by scanning tunneling microscopy.[17] Finally, we stress that the decrease in \(T_{\rm c}\) with increasing pressure [Fig. 3(b)] is reasonable judging from the result that the \(T_{\rm c}\) lowers with a decrease in \(c\) caused by an insertion of ions with larger ionic radii, as shown in Fig. 4(d), suggesting that the physical pressure effect in (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)Cs\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe can be uniformly understood with chemical pressure effect in (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)\(M_{\rm x}\)FeSe. This clearly shows that the scaling of \(T_{\rm c}\) by FeSe plane spacing is meaningful. However, since the deviation from the straight line in the low-pressure range may not clearly be explained at the present stage, further study is indispensable for clarifying the mechanism.

In conclusion, we have prepared new ammoniated and metal-intercalated FeSe materials, and (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)Cs\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe shows a higher \(T_{\rm c}\) than nonammoniated Cs\({}_{0.4}\)FeSe. Furthermore, a clear correlation between \(T_{\rm c}\) and plane spacing was observed, suggesting that an increase in nesting of the Fermi surface may produce higher \(T_{\rm c}\). In this paper, we did not discuss other scaling parameters, such as anion height or bonding angle found in LaFeAsO compounds.[18, 19] but the scaling of \(T_{\rm c}\) by FeSe plane spacing may be simpler and more understandable from physical point of view. Thus, the superconducting pairing in this system may also be caused by magnetic fluctuation in a weak SDW magnetic state, suggesting that this material is an unconventional superconductor. Consequently, this paper on new members in the (NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)\(M_{\rm x}\)FeSe family provided understanding for metal-intercalated FeSe materials.
