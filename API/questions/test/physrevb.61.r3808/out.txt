###### Abstract

To gain insight into the out-of-plane electrodynamics of high-_T_c superconductors we have measured the absolute values and temperature dependence of the _c_-axis magnetic penetration depth _l_c(_T_) for two typical single-layer high-_T_c cuprates, La2-,Sr,CuO4 and HgBa2CuO4+, as a function of doping. A distinct change in the behavior of _l_c is observed near 0.20 holes/Cu, which is related to the opening of the normal-state pseudogap. The variation of _l_c with doping is qualitatively similar to that of the in-plane component, _l_ob, which suggests that the _c_-axis superfluid response is mainly governed by the superconducting condensation energy. The strong doping dependence of _l_c(_0_) for p < 0.20 provides an explanation for the discrepancies in the literature.

The _c_-axis magnetic penetration depth _l_c in high-_T_c superconductors (HTS's) is a key parameter for understanding the interlayer dynamics of electrons. It is also important for assessing the proposed pairing mechanism arising from in-plane confinement, namely the interlayer tunneling (ILT) theory which was proposed by Anderson and co-workers.[1, 2, 3, 4] Although great effort has been devoted to the accurate measurement of _l_c, the experimental results are still controversial. For example, for optimally doped La2-,Sr,CuO4, optical[5] and surface impedance[6] measurements found _l_c(_T_) = 0 K) = 4 \mum, in agreement with the prediction of ILT theory. On the other hand for Tl2Ba2CuO6+, vertex imaging[7] and optical[8] measurements yielded _l_c(0) = 19 \mum, and more recent optical measurements gave 12 \mum.[9] These high values of _l_c(0) cannot be easily accounted by the ILT model.[10] Furthermore, for nearly optimally doped HgBa2CuO4+, (_T_c = 96 K), the values of _l_c(0) obtained by vortex imaging[11] and optical[12] measurements are <=8 \mum and 6 \mum, respectively. However, susceptibility measurements for slightly overdoped HgBa2CuO4+, (_T_c = 93 K) give _l_c(0) = 1.5 \mum (Ref. [13]) in agreement with ILT theory. The large discrepancies in the reported values of _l_c(0) for HTS's with one CuO2 plane per unit cell makes it difficult to reach a consensus regarding the trends of _l_c(0) in HTS's and also the validity of the ILT model.[10, 14, 15, 16] Moreover, the strong doping dependence of both the superconducting and normal-state properties[17] and the presence of the pseudogap in under- and optimally doped samples may play a significant role in the behavior of the _c_-axis electrodynamics. It is therefore important to study the _c_-axis superfluid response as a function of carrier concentration and search for possible correlations between the in-plane and out-of-plane superconducting properties and the normal-state pseudogap.

In this paper we report high quality data for _l_c, measured by the ac susceptibility technique, as functions of doping and temperature for La2-,Sr,CuO4 (LSCO) and HgBa2CuO4+, (Hg-1201). We find that _l_c(0) changes rapidly with doping when p < 0.20, and is almost independent of doping for p >= 0.20, where p is the hole concentration per planar Cu atom. A crossover near p = 0.20 is also observed in the behavior of the temperature dependence of _l_c-2, similar to that previously reported for the in-plane counterpart, _l_ob_2,[18] suggesting that it is also strongly affected by the presence of the normal-state pseudogap. The doping dependence of _l_c(0) shown here lends some support to the ILT model in the sense that it can account for the discrepancies in the reported values of _l_c(0) for Hg-1201.

The samples studied here were magnetically aligned high quality single-phase powders of La2-,Sr,CuO4 (_p_ = x = 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.22, and 0.24) (Ref. [18]) and HgBa2CuO4+, (_x_ = 0.10, i.e., p = 0.09, with _T_c = 60 K).[19] Measurements were performed down to 1.2 K for LSCO and 4.2 K for Hg-1201 using the low-field ac-susceptibility technique with an ac field of 1 G ms at 333 Hz parallel to the CuO2 planes. For LSCO the value of p is taken to be equal to the Sr content x, whereas for Hg-1201 it was determined by estimating the oxygen content and verified by thermopower measurements as in Ref. [19]. Transport, magnetic and spectroscopic measurements confirmed the high quality of our samples. The data were analyzed using London's model for small aligned crystallites of anisotropic HTS's. Details of the technique and data analysis can be found elsewhere.[20, 13] The low-field ac-susceptibility technique gives the fractional diamagnetism of a superconductor and thus is a direct probe of the magnetic penetration depth.[13] For each doping concentration of LSCO, the result presented here is typical of those obtained for four samples prepared independently from the same polycrystalline pellet. Each of these samples was aligned at different times and from each sample four pieces were cut and measured. Therefore a total of 16 samples were investigated for each doping content. In the case of Hg-1201, two samples were prepared from the same polycrystalline pellet and again four pieces of each aligned sample were cut and measured for each doping level. The error of \lambda_{c}(0) is estimated to be <8 % for LSCO and <10% for Hg-1201, while the error in the relative temperature dependence \lambda_{c}(T)/\lambda_{c}(0) is < 1% and is therefore negligible.

Figure 1(a) shows the doping dependence of \lambda_{c}(0) for LSCO and Hg-1201. Let us first discuss the case of LSCO. For comparison, our previously published data of \lambda_{ab}(0) for the same LSCO samples are also included.[18] The ratio of \lambda_{c}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(0) measures the electromagnetic anisotropy \gamma of the system. The values of \gamma for the samples we measured are shown in Fig. 1(b) and compared with those obtained by Shibauchi _et al._ for LSCO single crystals with x< 0.20 using the surface impedance technique.[6] There is very good agreement between the two sets of data despite the large error bars in Fig. 2(a) of Ref. [6]. From Fig. 1 we find that for the intermediate doping regime, 0.14<x< 0.20, T_{c} does not change very much, although there are significant changes in \lambda_{c}(0) and \gamma. Namely, \lambda_{c}(0), \lambda_{ab}(0), and \gamma increase rapidly for x= p< 0.20 holes/Cu and are nearly independent of doping for x= p\geq 0.20 with \lambda_{c}(0)\approx 2 \mum and \gamma=12.

Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of the c-axis superfluid density of LSCO as a function of doping. There is a noticeable change in the curvature of \lambda_{c}^{-2}(T) near 0.20 holes/Cu as previously observed in \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) and shown in Fig. 2(b) for comparison.[18] The relatively sudden change in curvature as well as in the absolute values of \lambda_{ab,c}^{-2} near x= 0.20 is not a feature unique to the superfluid response. It has also been observed in several other physical quantities, both in the normal and superconducting states, and attributed to the opening of the pseudogap in the low doping regime.[21, 22, 23, 24, 25] The physical mechanism leading to the normal-state pseudogap is still unknown. However, it is generally believed to cause a loss of the normal-state spectral weight near the Fermi energy.[18, 21, 26] The loss of spectral weight is expected to strongly suppress the superfluid density \lambda_{ab,c}^{-2} and alter the temperature dependence of both \lambda_{ab} and \lambda_{c}.[26, 27, 28, 29]

By comparing the data of \lambda_{c}(0) for LSCO with those for Hg-1201, we find that the doping dependences of \lambda_{c}(0) in these two compounds are very similar [Fig. 1(a)]. Namely, for an underdoped, an almost optimally doped (measured independently by two different techniques), and two overlapped Hg-1201 samples, with p\sim 0.09 [this work], 0.16 (Refs. [11] and [12]), 0.18 (Ref. [13]) and 0.23 (Ref. [30]) \pm 0.01 and T_{c}= {60  K, 96 K (Ref. [11]), 96 K (Ref. [12]), 93 K (Ref. [13]), and 60 K (Ref. [30]), the values of the c-axis penetration

The \lambda_{ab}(0) data are taken from Ref. [18]. \lambda_{c}(0) data for HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+x} are also included for p\sim 0.09 (crossed square) (this work), 0.16 (open triangle) (Ref. [11]), 0.16 (open square) (Ref. [12]), 0.18 (open circle) (Ref. [13]), and 0.23 (open diamond) (Ref. [30]). The doping dependence of \lambda_{ab}(0) in Hg-1201 is similar to that of LSCO.[18] The solid line is drawn as a guide to the eye.

The closed circles represent the values of T_{c} and the closed squares the values of \gamma measured here. Crossed squares are values of \gamma taken from Shibauchi _et al._ (Ref. [6]) for comparison.

  depth are \approx[8.5 \mum, 8 \pm 1 \mum (Ref. 11), 6 \pm 1 \mum (Ref. 12), 1.5 \mum (Ref. 13), and 2 \mum (Ref. 30)], respectively. These results are shown in Fig. 1(a) together with the LSCO data for comparison. The doping content for Hg-1201 was estimated using the universal relation T_{c}=T_{c,max}[1-82.6(p- 0.16)^{2}], where the maximum is reached for an optimum doping of p\approx 0.16 holes per CuO_{2} plane.[31] In the case of Hg-1201 T_{c,max} is chosen to be 96 K. For the samples studied here and in Refs. 13 and 30 the values of p estimated were confirmed from thermoelectric power measurements as in Ref. 19. Although there is some uncertainty in determining the value of p in Hg-1201, these results indicate that the doping dependence of \lambda_{c}(0) is qualitatively similar for these two single-layer high-T_{c} cuprates.

Our results show that there is no experimental inconsistency in the wide range of \lambda_{c}(0) values reported in the literature for the Hg-1201 compound. Namely, the value of 1.5 \mum that we obtained[13] for a slightly overdoped sample by the ac-susceptibility technique corresponds to the simple situation where there is no normal-state gap. Although the values of Kirtley _et al.[11]_ and Basov _et al.[22]_ correspond to samples with high values of T_{c} (96 K) the results shown here strongly suggest that their values of \lambda_{c}(0) correspond to significantly lower doping levels where the normal state gap comes into play. In this sense our results support the ILT model since the only clear exception to this model is now the Tl-2201 compound.[7, 8, 9] However, we should note that for any pairing mechanism (not just ILT) the presence of the normal-state gap also leads to a similar correlation between the condensation energy, and the superfluid density, i.e., \lambda_{c}(0) and \lambda_{ab}(0).[21, 26] There are also distinct differences between \lambda_{c} and \lambda_{ab}. The anisotropy \gamma increases on the underdoped side and the T dependences at low temperatures (at T< 0.3 T_{c}) are very different. Namely, the in-plane component varies always linearly with T, whereas the c-axis counterpart varies as T^{n} with n\approx 3 for LSCO [this work] and n\approx 5 for Hg-1201.[13] Details on possible mechanisms leading to these power laws can be found in Ref. 32. Therefore, it is not immediately obvious that the qualitative similarities between \lambda_{c}(T) and \lambda_{ab}(T) shown in Fig. 2 can be understood within the ILT theory where interplane Josephson effects dominate the c-axis electrodynamics.

In summary, we have measured the effects of carrier concentration on the c-axis superfluid response of two typical monolayer high-T_{c} cuprates. We observe a crossover in the behavior of \lambda_{c}(0,T) near p= 0.20, which is closely related to the opening of the pseudogap. The strong doping dependence of \lambda_{c}(0) for p< 0.20 provides an explanation for the discrepancies in the literature. The qualitatively similar behavior of \lambda_{c} and \lambda_{ab} as a function of doping suggests that both quantities are strongly affected by the presence of the normal-state pseudogap, as is the superconducting condensation energy.

In this paper we report high quality data for _l_c, measured by the ac susceptibility technique, as functions of doping and temperature for La2-,Sr,CuO4 (LSCO) and HgBa2CuO4+, (Hg-1201). We find that _l_c(0) changes rapidly with doping when p < 0.20, and is almost independent of doping for p >= 0.20, where p is the hole concentration per planar Cu atom.

The samples studied here were magnetically aligned high quality single-phase powders of La2-,Sr,CuO4 (_p_ = x = 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.22, and 0.24) (Ref. [18]) and HgBa2CuO4+, (_x_ = 0.10, i.e., p = 0.09, with _T_c = 60 K).[19] Measurements were performed down to 1.2 K for LSCO and 4.2 K for Hg-1201 using the low-field ac-susceptibility technique with an ac field of 1 G ms at 333 Hz parallel to the CuO2 planes. For LSCO the value of p is taken to be equal to the Sr content x, whereas for Hg-1201 it was determined by estimating the oxygen content and verified by thermopower measurements as in Ref. [19].

The error of \lambda_{c}(0) is estimated to be <8 % for LSCO and <10% for Hg-1201, while the error in the relative temperature dependence \lambda_{c}(T)/\lambda_{c}(0) is < 1% and is therefore negligible.

Figure 1(a) shows the doping dependence of \lambda_{c}(0) for LSCO and Hg-1201. Let us first discuss the case of LSCO. For comparison, our previously published data of \lambda_{ab}(0) for the same LSCO samples are also included.[18] The ratio of \lambda_{c}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(0) measures the electromagnetic anisotropy \gamma of the system.

Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of the c-axis superfluid density of LSCO as a function of doping. There is a noticeable change in the curvature of \lambda_{c}^{-2}(T) near 0.20 holes/Cu as previously observed in \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) and shown in Fig. 2(b) for comparison.[18] The relatively sudden change in curvature as well as in the absolute values of \lambda_{ab,c}^{-2} near x= 0.20 is not a feature unique to the superfluid response.

By comparing the data of \lambda_{c}(0) for LSCO with those for Hg-1201, we find that the doping dependences of \lambda_{c}(0) in these two compounds are very similar [Fig. 1(a)]. Namely, for an underdoped, an almost optimally doped (measured independently by two different techniques), and two overlapped Hg-1201 samples, with p\sim 0.09 [this work], 0.16 (Refs.

These results are shown in Fig. 1(a) together with the LSCO data for comparison. The doping content for Hg-1201 was estimated using the universal relation T_{c}=T_{c,max}[1-82.6(p- 0.16)^{2}], where the maximum is reached for an optimum doping of p\approx 0.16 holes per CuO_{2} plane.[31] In the case of Hg-1201 T_{c,max} is chosen to be 96 K. For the samples studied here and in Refs. 13 and 30 the values of p estimated were confirmed from thermoelectric power measurements as in Ref. 19. Although there is some uncertainty in determining the value of p in Hg-1201, these results indicate that the doping dependence of \lambda_{c}(0) is qualitatively similar for these two single-layer high-T_{c} cuprates.

Our results show that there is no experimental inconsistency in the wide range of \lambda_{c}(0) values reported in the literature for the Hg-1201 compound. Namely, the value of 1.5 \mum that we obtained[13] for a slightly overdoped sample by the ac-susceptibility technique corresponds to the simple situation where there is no normal-state gap. Although the values of Kirtley _et al.[11]_ and Basov _et al.[22]_ correspond to samples with high values of T_{c} (96 K) the results shown here strongly suggest that their values of \lambda_{c}(0) correspond to significantly lower doping levels where the normal state gap comes into play. In this sense our results support the ILT model since the only clear exception to this model is now the Tl-2201 compound.[7, 8, 9] However, we should note that for any pairing mechanism (not just ILT) the presence of the normal-state gap also leads to a similar correlation between the condensation energy, and the superfluid density, i.e., \lambda_{c}(0) and \lambda_{ab}(0).[21, 26] There are also distinct differences between \lambda_{c} and \lambda_{ab}. The anisotropy \gamma increases on the underdoped side and the T dependences at low temperatures (at T< 0.3 T_{c}) are very different. Namely, the in-plane component varies always linearly with T, whereas the c-axis counterpart varies as T^{n} with n\approx 3 for LSCO [this work] and n\approx 5 for Hg-1201.[13] Details on possible mechanisms leading to these power laws can be found in Ref. 32. Therefore, it is not immediately obvious that the qualitative similarities between \lambda_{c}(T) and \lambda_{ab}(T) shown in Fig. 2 can be understood within the ILT theory where interplane Josephson effects dominate the c-axis electrodynamics.

In summary, we have measured the effects of carrier concentration on the c-axis superfluid response of two typical monolayer high-T_{c} cuprates. We observe a crossover in the behavior of \lambda_{c}(0,T) near p= 0.20, which is closely related to the opening of the pseudogap. The strong doping dependence of \lambda_{c}(0) for p< 0.20 provides an explanation for the discrepancies in the literature. The qualitatively similar behavior of \lambda_{c} and \lambda_{ab} as a function of doping suggests that both quantities are strongly affected by the presence of the normal-state pseudogap, as is the superconducting condensation energy.
