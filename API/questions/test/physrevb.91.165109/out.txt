^{13}National the FeSe family is facilitated by electron-phonon interaction. Furthermore, pure magnetic or spin-orbital interactions affect the interband coupling leading to a decrease of thermodynamic T_{c} like in the case of MgB_{2}. Identifying the origin of the SC pairing mechanism is the key to understanding these interesting properties of FeSe. There is no general consensus regarding the nature of pairing at the moment. For instance, the bulk probes, such as specific heat [15], Andreev reflections spectroscopy [16], thermal conductivity [17], and the London penetration depth \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T)[18, 19, 20] point to the existence of two-gap nodeless superconductivity. On the other hand, evidence for nodal superconductivity in FeSe has been reported from the surface-sensitive probes, such as scanning tunneling spectroscopy [21].

In this paper we report on magnetization, resistivity up to 19 T, London penetration depth, and low-temperature specific heat measurements of FeSe_{1-x}S_{x}. Although similar investigations have been performed in detail on analogous compounds, i.e., Fe(Se,Te) [18,19,22,23], such studies are lacking in the case of S-doped FeSe. Exploring the symmetry and structure of the order parameter, and the evolution of the SC gap with S doping in the FeSe_{1-x}S_{x} system through systematic measurements of temperature dependent specific heat and SC penetration depth is thus highly desired. In order to better understand the SC pairing mechanism it is necessary to examine how these properties are affected by a different chemical composition. In the first part we deal with magnetic measurements in magnetic dc fields applied parallel to the c axis. We show that the introduction of S to FeSe enhances the upper critical field H_{c2}, critical current density J_{c}, and the T_{c}. The upper critical fields H_{c2} have been determined from our detailed resistance measurements, ac magnetization, and specific heat studies, yielding a high superconducting anisotropy \Gamma\sim 4 for x=0.04. The anisotropy \Gamma of the critical field is largest close to T_{c} and decreases with decreasing temperature. From the measured temperature dependence of the specific heat, reliable values of the normal-state Sommerfeld coefficients are obtained for these materials. The second part of the paper is devoted to the study of the currently debated issue of the SC pairing symmetry by using high-quality single crystals of FeSe_{1-x}S_{x}. Based on the comprehensive low-T measurements of the magnetic penetration depth and specific heat, we provide evidence for strongly coupled multiband and nodeless superconductivity in the FeSe family. In addition, the presence of multiple kinks in \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) gives strong evidence for the existence of two energy gaps in Fe(Se,S), which implies that several sheets of the Fermi surface contribute to the formation of Cooper pairs. Although the electronic specific heat of the SC state can be well described by using a two-band model, the change of specific heat induced by a magnetic field can be understood only in terms of multiband superconductivity.

## II Experimental details

All preparation steps like weighing, mixing, grinding, and storage were carried out in an Ar-filled glovebox (O_{2} and H_{2}O level less than 0.1 ppm). FeSe_{1-x}S_{x} single crystals were grown in evacuated quartz ampoules using the AlCl_{3}/KCl flux technique in a temperature gradient (a hot part of the ampule at 400 deg degC and a cold part at 350 degC) for 45 days [16]. The chemical composition of crystals was studied with a digital scanning electron microscope TESCAN Vega II XMU [16]. The standard deviation of the average S concentration allows us to judge upon the homogeneity of S within the crystals. Therefore, the composition and in particular the S-doping level was obtained by an average of over several different points of each single crystal. The analysis showed that the approximate chemical compositions are FeSe_{1-x}, Fe(Se_{0.96\pm 0.01}S_{0.04\pm 0.01})_{1-x}, Fe(Se_{0.91\pm 0.01}S_{0.09\pm 0.01})_{1-x}, and Fe(Se_{0.89\pm 0.01}S_{0.11\pm 0.01})_{1-x}. The crystals have a platelike shape with the c axis oriented perpendicular to the crystal plane. The crystals have only a tetragonal \beta-FeSe phase present. The lattice parameters c=(5.52\pm 0.01) A and a=(3.77\pm 0.01) A are found for the FeSe single crystal. The quality of the grown single crystals was investigated by complementary techniques.

Magnetization measurements were performed by using a Quantum Design SQUID. The temperature dependent electronic transport was measured by using a standard four-probe alternating current dc method within a current applied parallel to the ab plane. Electrical contacts parallel to the ab plane were made using thin copper wires attached to the sample with silver epoxy. High field resistance measurements were done using a high field SC magnet up to 21 T manufactured by Cryogenic Ltd. The low-T specific heat was measured in the Quantum Design's Physical Property Measurement System within a T range from 2 to 14 K in magnetic fields of up to H=9 T applied along the c and ab axis of the crystal. During the heat capacity measurements, the sample was cooled to the lowest temperature in the presence of an applied magnetic field [field cooled (FC)] and the specific heat data were collected using the adiabatic thermal relaxation technique.

## III Results and discussions

### **Magnetization**

#### iii.1 **dc** magnetization measurements

In Fig. 1(a) we show the magnetic susceptibility \chi, measured with zero field cooling (ZFC) and FC. T_{c} has been determined from the onset of diamagnetic response to be around \sim8.5, 9.58, 10.1, and 10.7 K for x=0, 0.04, 0.09, and 0.11, respectively. These values are comparable with the resistivity and magnetic data that has been reported for polycrystalline samples [24]. The FC and ZFC data show a sharp diamagnetic signal onset. The SC volume fraction of the crystals is close to 1, thus confirming bulk superconductivity and the high quality of the investigated systems. The clear irreversibility between FC and ZFC measurements is a consequence of a strong vortex trapping mechanism, either by surface barriers or bulk pinning. The fact that the hysteresis loops are symmetric around the M=0 line, points to relatively weak surface barriers and is indicative of strong bulk pinning [25]. This consideration holds for all studied temperatures and investigated samples, even close to T_{c}, and indicates that vortex penetration occurs at a field close to the thermodynamic H_{c1} (corrected by the demagnetization factor). Magnetization curves [Figs. 1(b) and 1(c)] show the presence of a second peak for FeSe_{0.91}S_{0.09} and FeSe_{0.96}S_{0.04} for H\parallel c. The second peak effect has been  studied extensively and its origin may be attributed to various mechanisms. The superconducting hysteresis loops M(H) exhibits no paramagnetic background, which indicates that our investigated samples contain negligible amount of magnetic impurities and all Fe atoms are in a nonmagnetic state of Fe^{2+}. From the irreversibility of the magnetization hysteresis loops in M(H), we have extracted the magnetic field dependence of the critical current density J_{c} at different temperatures [see Fig. 1(d)]. We used Bean's critical state model [26] in which the critical current is constant across the sample and the critical current density in a platelet sample is given by

\[J_{c}=\frac{2\Delta M}{\left[a\left(1-\frac{a}{3b}\right)\right]},\] (1)

where \Delta M=M_{\text{dn}}-M_{\text{up}}, M_{\text{dn}} and M_{\text{up}} are the magnetization values measured on the decreasing and increasing branches of M(H), respectively, and a (cm) and b (cm) are sample sizes perpendicular to the applied field (a<b). Here \Delta M is in electromagnetic units per cubic centimeter and the calculated J_{c} is in ampere per square centimeter. The calculated J_{c} values are summarized in Table 1. Figure 1(e) shows the in-plane resistivity data for x=0, 0.04, 0.09, and 0.11 samples near T_{c}. A sharp SC transition is seen in all of the samples which is in agreement with the magnetization data in Fig. 1(a). Upon cooling the resistivity decreases monotonically and shows a metallic behavior.

#### ac magnetization measurements

Figures 2(a) and 2(b) depict the temperature dependence of the volume ac susceptibilities \chi_{v}^{\prime} for x=0.04 and 0.09, respectively. The measurements were done in an ac field with an amplitude H_{\text{ac}}=5 Oe and a frequency f=1 kHz in dc fields up to 9 T parallel to the c axis. Special care has been taken to correct the magnetization data for the demagnetization factor, where the demagnetization factor has been estimated based on crystal dimensions [27]. In general, ac-susceptibility measurements can be used for an investigation of the flux dynamics in superconductors. The imaginary part \chi_{v}^{\prime\prime} is related

Figure 1: (Color online) (a) The T dependence of the magnetic susceptibility \chi in an external field of 10 Oe applied along the c axis. \chi has been deduced from the dc magnetization measured by following ZFC and FC protocols. (b) and (c) The isothermal magnetization M vs H loops measured at different temperatures ranging from 2 to 9 K up to 9 T applied along the c axis. (d) The T dependence of the critical current density J_{c} values at H=0 for x=0, 0.04, 0.09, and 0.11. (e) The temperature dependence of the in-plane electrical resistivity in zero field and represents a zoom of the resistivity data around the superconducting transition.

  to the energy dissipation in the sample due to vortex motion and the real part \chi_{v}^{\prime} is related to the amount of Meissner currents screening. Both functions depend on the ratio between the skin depth \delta_{s} and the sample dimension L in the direction of the flux penetration. In the normal state \delta_{s}\sim(\rho_{n}/f)^{0.5}, where \rho_{n} is the normal-state resistivity and f is the frequency [28]. In the superconducting state, the skin depth \delta_{s}\propto\lambda_{L} if an external magnetic field is below the first critical field H_{c1}, where \lambda_{L} is the London penetration depth. For magnetic fields above H_{c1}, \delta_{s}\propto L_{B}, where L_{B}\sim B_{\rm ac}/J_{c} is the Bean's penetration depth and J_{c} is the critical-current density. In general, if L\ll\delta_{s} the ac field completely penetrates the sample, although the susceptibility is small. In the opposite case, L\gg\delta_{s}, most of the sample volume is screened. Therefore, 4\pi\,\chi^{\prime}_{v}=-1 and \chi_{v}^{\prime\prime}\to 0.

In accordance with this, the ac-susceptibility data measured at low temperatures confirm the bulk superconductivity of the investigated crystals. The transition temperature T_{c} has been extracted from the bifurcation point between \chi^{\prime}_{v} and \chi^{\prime\prime}_{v}. This point is related to the change in the resistivity due to the superconducting transition. It can be also used for the determination of the temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_{c2} from the ac-susceptibility data measured at various dc fields, see Fig. 4(d). Therefore, the most natural way to investigate the vortex dynamics is to repeat \chi_{\rm ac} vs T scans at a fixed H_{\rm dc} at different frequencies v_{n} in order to employ empirical peak functions around the maxima. Figure 2(c) presents the temperature dependence of the imaginary part of ac susceptibility at various frequencies v_{m} for FeSe. One can clearly see that the peak maxima shifts to a higher temperatures upon increasing the frequency which is apparently due to the motion of vortices. Figure 1(d) shows T_{P} values, the position of the maxima of imaginary part in (c) vs v_{m}. One can notice that, similarly to what was observed in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}[29] and CeFeAsO_{0.92}F_{0.08}[30], the quantity 1/T_{p} presents a frequency dependence over the explored range of v, the explored frequency range at fixed applied field H [H_{\rm ac}=1 Oe and H_{\rm dc}=1 T, see Fig. 2(d)]. The latter phenomenology is well verified for samples x=0,0.04, and 0.09. The dashed line outlines the expected logarithmic trend typical for the thermally activated process according to 1/T_{p}(v_{m})=-\frac{1}{U_{0}}\ln\frac{v_{m}}{v_{0}}. The parameter v_{0} represents an intraband condensate vortex hopping. From the latter equation, it can be observed that the logarithmic behavior of 1/T_{p} is mainly controlled by the parameter U_{0}, playing the role of an effective depinning energy barrier in a thermally activated flux creep model.

### Specific heat

Low-temperature specific heat C_{P}, being equal to the temperature derivative of the entropy S, probes the gap structure of bulk superconductors. The thermodynamic C_{P} measurements complement well the magnetic (\lambda) measurements, since the former is hardly affected by vortex pinning. The information about the pairing symmetry is contained in the C_{\rm el}, which is proportional to the quasiparticle (QP) density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy. First we address the zero-field T-dependent specific heat data of FeSe_{1-x}S_{x} plotted as C_{p}/T vs T [Fig. 3(a)]. A clear sharp anomaly is observed due to the SC phase transition. In order to determine the specific heat related to the SC phase transition we need to estimate the phonon (C_{\rm ph}) and electron (C_{\rm el}) contributions. At low temperatures, C_{\rm el} behaves linearly with temperatures, while C_{\rm ph} varies as C_{\rm ph}\propto T^{3}. In order to improve the reliability at higher temperatures, we use a second term of the harmonic-lattice approximation below 14 K. The data can be well described by C_{\rm el}+C_{\rm ph}=\gamma\,T+\alpha\,T^{3}+\beta\,T^{5} [see the dashed line in Fig. 3(a)], in which the lattice contribution is accounted for by \alpha\,T^{3}+\beta\,T^{5}. The Sommerfield coefficient \gamma_{n} values are 5.3(1), 5.1(0.5), 4.9(0.5), and 4.95 for x=0, 0.04, 0.09, and 0.11, respectively. The estimated universal parameter

Figure 2: (Color online) (a) and (b) Summarize the temperature dependence of the complex ac-susceptibility components 4\pi\,\chi^{\prime}_{v} of x=0.09 and 0.11 measured in an ac field with an amplitude of 5 Oe and a frequency of 1 kHz. The data were collected upon warming in different dc magnetic fields after cooling in a zero magnetic field. (c) The imaginary part of ac susceptibility at various v_{m} for x=0. (d) The values from the position of the maxima of the imaginary part in (c) vs v_{m} for x=0, 0.04, and 0.09.

  \Delta C_{\rm el}/\gamma_{\rm z}T_{c} of the specific heat at T_{c} is \approx2.14, 2.43, 2.2, and 1.95 mJ/mol K^{2} for x = 0, 0.04, 0.09, and 0.11, respectively.

According to the BCS theory, the specific heat jump of a superconductor at T_{c} should follow \Delta C_{p}/\gamma_{\rm z}T_{c} = 1.43 in the weak coupling limit. It is so far well reported that a reduced jump in the specific heat \Delta C_{p}/T_{c} compared to that of a single-band s-wave superconductor might be related to a pronounced multiband character of superconductivity with rather different partial densities of states and gap values [28]. However, jumps of specific heat at T_{c} in these materials show a deviation from the trend established by Bud'ko-Ni-Canfield (BNC) scaling \Delta C_{p}/T_{c}\propto T^{2}[31]. This power law seems to be appropriate for many iron-based superconductors, so far for the 122 systems, i.e., Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} and Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ni_{x})_{2}As_{2}[32]. One of the possible reasons for this universal relation might be a strong pair breaking and the impurity scattering effect in a multiband superconductor [31, 33]. Recently, a specific heat jump shows also a deviation from that trend in FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5}[34]. In addition, the heavily hole-doped superconductors (K,Na)Fe_{2}As_{2} stands out from the other Fe pnictides [35, 36].

From the extracted \gamma_{\rm z} values we have estimated the values of the universal parameter C_{\rm el}/\gamma_{\rm z}T_{c} in Table 1 [Fig. 3(b)]. However, a domelike dependence on doping is seen similar to the one in NaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}As [37] and Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co/Ni_{x})_{2}As_{2}[38, 39]. The values recorded in Fig. 3(b) are larger than the BCS weak-coupling prediction of 1.43. Therefore, we notice that the reduced specific heat jumps are larger than those of optimally doped Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2}[41]. Nevertheless, the values are comparable to those of optimally doped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}[42]. In addition, band-structure calculations in FeSe estimated the value of \gamma_{\rm z} of about 2.2 mJ/mol K^{2}. Since \gamma_{\rm z} = (1 + \lambda_{\rm el-bos})\gamma_{\rm z}, where \lambda_{\rm el-bos} is the total coupling strength between the QP and bosons [43], the \lambda_{\rm el-bos} value is estimated to be \approx1.4. Without any model fitting, the values of normalized specific heat jump and the \lambda_{\rm el-bos} constant have already further confirmed a stronger electron-boson-coupling strength in FeSe_{1-x}S_{x}.

### The upper critical fields H_{\rm c2}(T) and their anisotropy

Figures 3(c) and 3(d) summarize the temperature dependence of the specific heat measured at different applied magnetic fields parallel to the c axis (and parallel to the ab plane) as shown in the insets x = 0.04 and 0.09, respectively. In zero-field specific-heat measurements, a very sharp anomaly is clearly seen. This anomaly is attributed to the SC transition at T_{c}. This specific-heat jump is systematically shifted to lower temperatures upon applying dc magnetic fields of up to 9 T in both orientations. In order to determine the SC transition temperature for each field, an entropy conserving construction has been used. The inset in Fig. 3(e) presents the temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat near the transition temperature at 0.5 T \parallel ab and 2 T \parallel ab data. The results yield an anisotropy of about \Gamma=4 for x = 0.04. The extracted data

The upper inset: Enlarged C_{p}/T vs T plot near the SC transition for x = 0.04. The lines illustrate how C_{p}/T_{c} and T_{c} are estimated. The dashed line is the fitting of the specific heat below 14 K by using C_{p}=\gamma_{\rm z}T+\alpha T^{3}+\beta T^{5}. (b) The doping dependence of the normalized specific heat jump is \Delta C_{p}/\gamma_{\rm z}T_{c} for x = 0, 0.04, 0.09, and 0.11. (c) and (d) Summarize the temperature dependence of the specific heat of x = 0.04 and 0.09, respectively, in various applied magnetic fields up to 9 T parallel to the c axis and parallel to the ab plane as presented in the insets. (e) The temperature dependence of the specific heat of both orientation for 0 and 9 T two data sets with the same T_{c} value for the two directions. The inset highlights the electronic specific heat data after subtracting the phonon contribution for x = 0.04 of the two data sets with the same T_{c} value for the two directions. The data present the 0.5 T B\parallel c and for 2 T B\parallel ab. (f) The temperature dependence of the complex ac-susceptibility components 4\pi\chi^{\prime}_{x} and 4\pi\chi^{\prime}_{v} of x = 0.04 of both orientation for 0 and 9 T measured in an ac field with an amplitude of 5 Oe and a frequency of 1 kHz. The data in (e) and (f) show that the electronic specific heat divided by temperature for B\parallel ab and B\parallel c and the ac susceptibility represents an anisotropy of \Gamma = 4 for S-doping concentration.

  at each field were used to map out the SC phase diagram depicting H_{c2} [see Fig. 4(d)].

The results from the temperature dependent magnetoresistivity measurements on single crystals of FeSe and FeSe_{0.91}S_{0.09} in dc magnetic fields of up to 19 T with the field direction parallel to the c plane are shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. There is pronounced broadening of the SC transition at high fields for H\parallel c. We define the characteristic temperature of the superconducting transition using the T_{c}^{0\%} criteria. The phase diagrams of H_{c2}(T) for x=0, 0.04, and 0.09 are summarized in the main panel of Fig. 4(c). The data points are extracted from magnetoresistivity measurements in fields of up to 19 T as well as from magnetization and specific heat in fields of up to 9 T. The observed small differences between the H_{c2}(T) lines obtained from the specific heat, ac magnetization, and resistance measurements for H\parallel c is not surprising since these methods employ different criteria for the T_{c} determination. Using the data in Fig. 4(c), the upper critical field values at T=0 for the FeSe_{1-x}S_{x} system have been evaluated to be \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{(c)}(0)\simeq 14.8(1), 17.5(1), and 18.5(1) T.

The main panel in Fig. 4(d) shows the temperature dependence of the upper critical field in FeSe single crystals together with the data obtained by Vedeneev _et al._[40], as well as the theoretical estimates using Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg model (WHH) [44]. The inset shows the data for FeSe_{0.96}S_{0.04} together with the WHH prediction. The WHH model describes the behavior of the H_{c2}(T) in conventional single gap BCS type-II superconductors without spin paramagnetic and spin-orbit effects (\alpha=0,\lambda_{\infty}=0) [44]. Here \alpha is the Maki parameter which describes the relative strength of orbital pair breaking and the limit of paramagnetism. \lambda_{\infty} (when \lambda_{\infty}>0, the effect of the spin-paramagnetic term) is the spin-orbit coupling strength. The orbital limiting field H_{c2}^{\rm orb} at zero temperature is determined by the slope of H_{c2}(T) at T_{c} as \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\rm orb}=0.69\ T_{c}\ (\alpha\mu_{0}H_{c2}/\Omega T)|_{T_{c}}. It is evident that the single-band WHH model fails to extrapolate to the measured values of H_{c2}(0). Therefore, we believe that the observed deviation from the single band WHH model is related to multiband effects present in the FeSe system. This behavior is reminiscent of the one reported in other Fe-based superconductors [28] in which similar H_{c2}(T) curves were well described by a multiband effect. This claim is further supported by the indications of a two-band-like behavior from the zero-field specific heat measurements and the London penetration depth discussed below.

In all of the investigated S-doped samples, both specific heat and ac-susceptibility measurements at 9 T in the H\parallel ab plane data show a sharper transition compared to the 9 T data \parallel c, indicating a highly anisotropic crystal [see Figs. 3(e) and 3(f)]. From the behavior of H_{c2} vs T in different field orientations we calculate the anisotropy \Gamma=H_{c2}^{B\perp c}/H_{c2}^{B\parallel c} using a linear interpolation. The results are outlined in the inset of Fig. 4(c). Our data allow tracking of \Gamma up to temperatures very close to T_{c}. \Gamma increases upon approaching T_{c} and reaches a value of about 4 at the critical temperature for x=0.04. This finding is in contrast to the results found in other Fe-based superconductors, which suggest a saturation or even a decrease of \Gamma close to T_{c}[45]. This indicates that an orbital pair breaking dominates the suppression of superconductivity close to T_{c}. At lower temperatures, the isotropic Zeeman pair breaking becomes more important, which leads to lowering of \Gamma. Moreover, the strong T-dependent superconducting anisotropy \Gamma=H_{c2}^{B\perp c}/H_{c2}^{B\parallel c} provides further evidence for a multiband scenario as in the case of the two-band superconductor MgB_{2}[46]. Surprisingly, this anisotropy is considerably larger than the typical values of \Gamma\sim 2 and 2.6 found in nearly optimally hole-doped (BaK)Fe_{2}As_{2}[47] and in FeSe_{0.45}Te_{0.55}[48] (T_{c}=14.5 K), but lower than the ones in SmFeAsO_{0.85}F_{0.15} and La(O,F)FeAs thin films [49, 50]. On the other hand, these values are comparable to \Gamma values of, e.g., KFe_{2}As_{2}[28] and LaFePO [51].

### Superconducting energy-gap structure

#### iii.4.1 London penetration depth

The London penetration depth \lambda is a fundamental parameter characterizing the SC condensate and probes the gap structure of bulk superconductors. The T dependence of \lambda is directly determined by the gap function \Delta(T). \lambda(T)=\lambda(T=0)+\delta\lambda(T) behaves as \delta\lambda(T)\propto\exp(\frac{-\Delta}{\delta_{T}T}) at low T reflecting a nodelsss superconducting gap \Delta with s-wave symmetry. In a d-wave pairing scenario containing line nodes, \delta\lambda(T)\propto T at low T in the clean limit. The experimental determination of the London penetration depth \lambda(0) via measurement of the lower critical field H_{c1} is challenging since H_{c1} is an equilibrium thermodynamic field. The temperature dependence of the SC penetration depth provides another method for detecting the existence of multiple gaps [52, 53]. A popular approach to measuring H_{c1} is by tracking the virgin M(H) curve at low fields and identifying the deviation from the linear Meissner response which would correspond to the first vortex penetration (see Fig. 5). This technique implicitly relies on the assumption that no surface barriers are present. We have confirmed the absence of the surface barriers in our case from the very symmetric dc magnetization hysteresis curves M(H) [see Figs. 1(b) and 1(c) and the inset in Fig. 5(a)]. On the other hand, if surface barriers were predominant, the first vortex entrance would occur at much higher field (\simH_{c}). Thus absence of surface barriers is very important for obtaining reliable estimates of the thermodynamic lower critical field. The transition from linear to nonlinear M(H) was determined by a user-independent procedure consisting of calculating the regression coefficient R of a linear fit to the data points collected between 0 and H, as a function of H (see the insets in Fig. 5). In contrast to tracking the virgin M(H) curve at low fields at several temperatures, in which case a heavy data post-processing is needed (see Fig. 5 ), here a careful measurement protocol needs to be followed with little data analysis. Indeed, the H_{c1} values from the virgin magnetization data are close to those obtained from the onset of the trapped flux moment M_{t} [see the inset in Fig. 6(e)]. Here M_{t} is obtained by following sequence: (i) warming the sample up to temperatures above T_{c}, i.e., 12 K, then (ii) cooling the sample in zero field down to the particular T, and subsequently (iii) increasing the applied magnetic field to a certain maximum value H_{m}, and in a last step (iv) measuring the remanent magnetization M_{t} after the applied field has been removed. The field H_{m} at which M_{t} deviates from zero determines the H_{c1} value at the desired temperature. Then, the extrapolation  \sqrt{M_{t}}\to 0 determines the exact value of the H_{c1}. The inset of Fig. 6(e) presents the typical plot of \sqrt{M_{t}} vs the applied field H, for FeSe_{0.96}S_{0.04} single crystals. The solid line is a linear fit to the high-field data of \sqrt{M_{t}} vs H. H_{c1} is determined by intercept of the fit with the abscissa.

The above measured values of H_{c1} need to be corrected due to the finite demagnetization effects. Indeed, the deflection of field lines around the sample leads to a more pronounced Meissner slope given by M/H_{a}=-1/(1-N), where N is the demagnetization factor. Taking into account these effects, the absolute value of H_{c1} can be estimated by using the relation proposed by Brandt [54]. For our samples we find N\approx 0.96, 0.95, 0.97, and 0.96 for FeSe_{0.96}S_{0.04}, FeSe_{0.91}S_{0.09}, FeSe_{0.89}S_{0.11}, and FeSe, respectively. In order to shed light on the pairing symmetry in our system, we estimated the penetration depth using the traditional Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory, where H_{c1} is given by \mu_{0}H_{c1}^{\mathrm{f}c1}=(\phi_{0}/4\pi\lambda_{ab}^{2})\ln\kappa_{c}, where \phi_{0} is the magnetic-flux quantum \phi_{0}=h/e^{*}=2.07\times 10^{-7} Oe cm^{2}, and \kappa_{c}=\lambda_{ab}/\xi_{ab} is the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. The value of \kappa was determined from the equation \frac{2H_{c1}(0)}{H_{c2}(0)}=\frac{\ln\kappa_{c}+0.5}{\kappa^{2}}. It should be mentioned that the SC penetration depth is a very important physical quantity and it is sensitive to the absolute value of the order parameter(s); and, in that sense, also sensitive to any nodes or a deep local minima of the gap. It is worth mentioning that the SC penetration depth is also dependent on the distribution of Fermi velocities. In this context it is most sensitive to fast electrons in sharp contrast to the upper critical field which is highly sensitive to the subgroup of electrons with low Fermi velocities.

In Figs. 6(d)-6(f) we analyze the temperature dependence of the London penetration depth for the samples with x=0, 0.04, and 0.09, respectively. We compare our data to the d wave and single-gap BCS theory under the weak-coupling approach [see dotted and dashed lines in Figs. 6(d)-6(f)]. Indeed, both quantities lead to a rather different trend and show a systematic deviation from the data in the whole T range below T_{c}. On the other hand, we also apply a phenomenological two-gap model which is in line with the multigap superconductivity reported by Carrington and Manzano [55]. Within this model the temperature dependence of each energy gap can be approximated as [55, 56, 57]\Delta_{i}(T)=\Delta_{i}(0)tanh\{1.82[1.018(\frac{T_{ab}}{T}-1)]^{0.51}\}. According to Ref. [58], for each band, \lambda_{i}^{-2}(T) is given by

\[\lambda_{i}^{-2}(T)=\frac{\Delta_{i}(T)\mathrm{tanh}\left(\frac{\Delta_{i}(T) }{2\mu_{0}T}\right)}{\lambda_{i}^{2}(0)\Delta_{i}(0)},\] (2)

where \lambda_{i}(0) is the residual penetration depth for each band and k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant. Considering different partial contributions of each band to the overall \lambda(T), we use the following expression: \lambda^{-2}(T)=r\lambda_{1}^{-2}(T)+(1-r)\lambda_{2}^{-2}(T), with r being the weighting factor indicating the contribution of the small gap. The best description of the experimental data is obtained using values of \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.72\pm 0.3, 1.79\pm 0.25, and 0.79\pm 0.15 and \Delta_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}=2.28\pm 0.3, 2.1\pm 0.25, and 1.95\pm 0.2 for x=0.09, 0.04, and 0, respectively. The weighting factor is found to be around r=0.25\pm 0.08, 0.38\pm 0.1, and 0.22\pm 0.2 for x=0, 0.04, and 0.09, respectively. The fits are represented by solid red lines in Figs. 6(d)-6(f). The extracted gap values for FeSe are comparable to those obtained from the two-band s-wave fit of the specific heat data and the Andreev reflection spectroscopy results [15, 16]. It is worth pointing out that the \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) of the SC samples [see the inset of Fig. 6(d)] does not saturate at low temperatures, as it could be expected for a fully gapped clean s-wave superconductor. \lambda_{ab}(T) is nearly constant at low temperatures, which demonstrates negligible quasiparticle excitations. The above penetration depth results are consistent with the presence of two s-wave-like gaps. Both gap values in the S-doped samples are considerably larger than the BCS weak-coupling limit. These observations show clearly that there are no nodes in the SC energy gap indicating a strong-coupling multiband (and nodeless) superconductivity in iron chalcogenide Fe(Se,S) superconductors. A similar possible strong coupling multiband superconductivity in Fe(Se,Te) has been conjectured from a detailed penetration depth and specific heat experiments [22, 23]. The temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth of d-wave SC gap calculations was

  performed by using the following functional form [18, 20]:

\[\frac{\lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T)}{\lambda_{ab}^{-2}(0)}=1+\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{\Delta(T,\varphi)}^{\infty}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial E}\right)\frac {EdEd\varphi}{\sqrt{E^{2}-\Delta(T,\varphi)^{2}}},\] (3)

where f=[1+\exp(E/k_{B}T)]^{-1} is the Fermi function, \varphi is the angle a long the Fermi surface, and \Delta(T,\varphi)=\Delta_{0}\delta(T/T_{c})g(\varphi) (\Delta_{0} is the maximum gap value at T=0). The function g(\varphi) is given by g^{d}(\varphi)=|\cos(2\varphi)| for the d-wave gap. The results of the analysis are presented in Figs. 6(d)-6(f) by dotted lines. The fit of the experimental data for the d-wave case we get for \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=2.8, 2.36, and 3.05 for x=0, 0.04, and 0.09. It is obvious that the d-wave case cannot describe the penetration depth data. On the other hand, the experimental data are well described by the two-gap s-wave models.

It is noteworthy that in a FeTe_{0.58}Se_{0.42} system, a careful analysis of the SC and normal state properties indicates a possibility of strong coupling superconductivity [59]. This study is followed by precise measurements of the temperature dependence of the London penetration depth by Cho _et al._ Their analysis strongly suggests a presence of two s-wave-like gaps with magnitudes \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.93 and \Delta_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}=0.9[60]. These two precise measurements [59, 60] were followed by the comment of Klein _et al._[61] and response of Cho _et al._[62]. In the latter case, the authors have shown convincingly that previous studies [22] most likely have issues with pair-breaking scattering. The authors have reported that the presence of strong scattering hinders any determination of gap values from the temperature dependence of the superfluid density.

#### iii.2.2 Specific heat

The normalized zero-field data C_{\rm el}/\nu_{\rm s}T as a function of the reduced temperature T/T_{c}, obtained after subtracting the C_{\rm ph}, is presented in Figs. 6(a)-6(c) together with the fits to various models. It is obvious from Figs. 6(a)-6(c) that the SC transition at T_{c} is well pronounced, with a sharp jump in C_{\rm el} at T_{c}. The entropy conservation required for a second-order phase transition is fulfilled as shown in Fig. 6(b). This check warrants the thermodynamic consistency for both: the measured data and the determination of C_{\rm el}. We have attempted best fits to the data using three different models: single-band weak-coupling BCS theory with the s-wave gap \Delta_{(0)}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.76; a d-wave calculation using \Delta=\Delta_{(0)}\cos(2\phi); and two-gap s wave in Figs. 6(a)-6(c). Below T_{c} we observe a systematic deviation of both single-gap and the d-wave fit from the data showing a higher jump at T_{c} than the s-wave model. Thus we focus our discussion on the possibility of two SC energy gaps using the generalized \alpha model that explains the specific heat behavior in multiband superconductors [63]. The corresponding fits are shown in Figs. 6(a)-6(c). Although the two-gap model contains two distinct gaps, the specific heat value is calculated as the sum of contributions, each one following the BCS-type temperature dependence \Delta(0)=\gamma_{1}\Delta_{1}(0)+\gamma_{2}\Delta_{2}(0)[63] and the thermodynamic properties are obtained as the sum of the contributions from the individual bands, i.e., \alpha_{1}=\Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c} and \alpha_{2}=\Delta_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}.

The estimated \Delta_{1}(0)/k_{B}T_{c} for the small gap for x=0, 0.04, and 0.09 is 0.88\pm 0.1, 1.9\pm 0.2, and 2.2\pm 0.2, while the large gap \Delta_{2}(0)/k_{B}T_{c} is found to be 2.2\pm 0.2, 2.5\pm 0.2, and 2.35\pm 0.2, for x=0, 0.04, and 0.09, respectively. The calculated data and the relative weights are illustrated as red lines in Figs. 6(a)-6(c). The error bars represents the width of the corresponding range of gap amplitudes obtained in the fit for both values of \Delta_{1}(0)/k_{B}T_{c} and \Delta_{2}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}. The results obtained in the present work are consistent with ones of the models considered in Ref. [15]. The ratio of the two gaps [\Delta_{1}(0)/\Delta_{2}(0) is \approx0.7 and 0.9 for x=0.04 and 0.09, respectively] is comparable to the FeSe_{0.43}Te_{0.57} case and it is noticeably larger than in iron pnictide superconductors (between 0.24 and 0.5) [41, 42]. All of the fitting parameters are remarkably consistent with those obtained from the penetration depth measurements. They give strong evidence for a two-gap SC at a Fe(Se,S) system. It has been theoretically

The inset of (a) presents the magnetic field dependence of magnetization in FeSe_{0.93}S_{0.09} single crystal at different temperatures close to T_{c}. The insets in (b) and (c) depict an example used to determine the H_{c1} value using the regression factor R, at T=2 K.

  demonstrated that in multiband superconductors if the ratio of two isotropic s-wave gaps \Delta_{1}(0)/\Delta_{2}(0)>0.5, the field-induced low energy excitations would be less pronounced compared to a single-band s-wave symmetry [64]. In this respect, in the low field range \gamma(H) would slowly increase with H (see Fig. 7). As mentioned above, our obtained ratio of the two gaps is higher compared to the critical value of 0.5 suggested by the theory, which further confirms the multiband nature in Fe(Se,S). In addition, the obtained two gaps of both S-doped samples are consistent with the penetration depth results and larger than the BCS value in the weak-coupling regime. Overall, such a behavior confirms the strong coupling nodeless superconductivity in Fe(Se,S).

Next, we discuss the field dependence of specific heat, which is another independent, sensitive test of the gap structure. It has been well demonstrated that in the case of an isotropic s-wave superconductor, \gamma(H)\propto H because the specific heat in the vortex state is dominated by the contribution from the localized QP in the vortex core. Recently, Storey _et al._[65] pointed out that the number of Caroli-de Genne bound states increases linearly with the field due to the linear increase in the number of vortices entering the sample. On the other hand, for the line nodes \gamma(H)\propto H^{0.5}, the QPs contributing to the DOS come from regions away from the vortex core and close to the nodes and supercurrents around the vortex core in the mixed state causing a Doppler shift of the QP excitation spectrum [66]. The temperature dependence of the low-T part of the specific heat data measured in various magnetic fields applied along the c axis is shown in the lower inset of Fig. 7. The data plotted as C_{p}/T vs T^{2} fits to C_{p}/T=\gamma_{n}+\beta T^{2}, with \gamma_{n} and \beta as electronic and lattice coefficients, respectively. It should be mentioned that the absence of the so-called \gamma_{r} at the linear-T term of the zero-field specific heat indicates high quality of the single crystals. Nearly perfect linear behavior without any magnetic impurities have been observed in our samples (see Fig. 7). The applied magnetic field enhances the low-T specific heat, indicating the increase of the QP DOS at the Fermi level induced by a magnetic field. A linear extrapolation of the low-T data to zero temperature yields the field dependence of the field-induced contribution. The main panel of Fig. 7 presents the field dependence of the specific heat coefficient. The dashed lines are linear fits for H\parallel c above H=1 T as anticipated for a case of nodeless SC gap.

The inset in (b) presents the entropy in the normal and SC state as a function of T. (d)–(f) The temperature dependence of the London penetration depth for x=0, 0.04, and 0.09, respectively. The inset in (d) presents the temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depths \lambda_{ab} vs T. The inset of (e) depicts an example used to determine the H_{c1} value using the trapped moment at T=2 K of the typical plot of \sqrt{M_{r}} vs H. The solid red line is a linear fit to the high-field data of \sqrt{M_{r}} vs H. H_{c1} values are determined by extrapolating the linear fit to \sqrt{M_{r}}=0. The inset in (f) represents the phase diagram of H_{c1} for the field applied along the c axis. The dashed lines represent the theoretical curves based on single-band weak-coupling BCS theory, while the dotted lines represent the d-wave approximation. The solid lines represent the curves of the two s-wave gap model.

  Further confirmation of the nodeless character of superconductivity in our investigated systems comes from the low temperature specific heat data of the finite-temperature region in the mixed state. In fact, the quasiparticle excitations in superconductors with different gap symmetries are obviously distinct. In s-wave superconductors, the inner-core states dominate quasiparticle excitations and a simple scaling law proposed by Liu _et al._ holds in the case of possible s-wave gap in Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{4}[67]:

\[C_{\rm QP}/T^{3}\approx C_{\rm core}/T^{3}=_{\gamma}n/H_{c2}(0)(T/\sqrt{H})^{ -2},\] (4)

where C_{\rm QP} and C_{\rm core} are the specific heat of quasiparticles induced by the applied magnetic field and quasiparticles present inside from the Abrikosov vortex cores in the mixed state, respectively. The s-wave scenario of the scaling result of the field-induced term in the mixed state is presented in the upper inset of Fig. 7. All the data at different magnetic fields can be roughly scaled within the s-wave scenario in one line.

For the sake of comparison, in Table 1 we have summarized the superconducting parameters for the investigated samples extracted from this study. According to Fig. 1(d) and Table 1, with increasing S content the critical current density, which is a measure of the strength of the pinning force density and can be very conveniently used to characterize the strength of disorder in the system, enhances, suggesting improved flux pinning in those samples. The absolute value of the penetration depth in the T\to 0 limit determined for FeSe_{0.96}S_{0.04}, FeSe_{0.91}S_{0.09}, and FeSe, yields \lambda_{ab}(0)=372(15), 433(15), and 446(15) nm, respectively. These values are somewhat smaller than 560(20) nm found in Fe(Te,Se) [22], but comparable to the FeSe_{0.85} and FeSe [18, 19]. In Figs. 6(d)-6(f) a kink structure is observed on the \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) curves. This kink in \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) can be associated with the two-band superconductivity as in the cases of Fe(Te,Se), Ba_{0.6}_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2}, and MgB_{2}[22, 68, 69]. The upper critical field H_{c2} for the S-doped FeSe sample increases with increased doping, which is mainly due to its enhanced T_{c}. From \gamma_{n} values we estimate the universal parameter \Delta C_{\rm el}/\gamma_{n}T_{c}, which is considerably higher than the prediction of the weak coupling BCS theory (\Delta C_{\rm el}/\gamma_{n}T_{c}=1.43). Taking into account the fact that the superconducting transition is relatively sharp [see Figs. 6(a)-6(c)], a distribution in T_{c} or the presence of impurity phases cannot explain the higher value of the universal parameter. We believe that the presence of strong coupling superconductivity explain this higher values. Most remarkably, the specific-heat data allows for precise evaluation of SC volume fraction (V_{\rm SC}), i.e., V_{\rm SC}=(\gamma_{n}-\gamma_{\gamma})/\gamma_{n}, with \gamma_{\gamma} being the residual electronic specific-heat coefficient. Since our \gamma_{\gamma} is almost absent (see lower inset in Fig. 7), V_{\rm SC} estimated from specific heat is in fair agreement with our magnetization data [see Fig. 1(a)]. The overall values of the investigated superconducting gap derived from specific heat is similar to the one obtained from the penetration depth. However, both large gap \Delta_{L} and smaller one \Delta_{S} upon doping present a higher value than the weak-coupling BCS (1.76k_{B}T_{c}) gap value, which reflects a tendency for strong coupling effects. This is inconsistent with the theoretical constraints of the weakly coupled two-band superconductor model in which one gap must be larger than the BCS gap and one smaller [70].

Although rather large single or multiple gap values were reported in Fe(Se,Te) from specific heat [23], penetration depth [22], and ARPES [71] suggesting strong-coupling multiband superconductivity, the pairing symmetry in Fe(Se,Te) is still under debate. Additionally, two independent reports of penetration depth measurements [72] and scanning tunneling microscopy [73] in Fe_{1+y}(Te_{1-x}Se_{x}) have claimed the possibility of nodes in the SC gap. Interestingly, near optimal doping FeSe_{0.45}Te_{0.55}, specific heat measurements demonstrate isotropic gap behavior under zero magnetic field but anisotropic/nodal gaps under magnetic field [23, 48]. Our data show that the Fe(Se,S) system belongs to the class of multiband superconductors, in the strong-coupling regime. Given the substantial divergency of the existing data on the gap values and the gap symmetry for FeSe-based superconductors, a combination of several independent techniques rather than a single technique is highly desirable. In the current paper we presented self-consistent data obtained from both lower critical field H_{c1} and specific heat measurements. We believe that other techniques such as \muSR, ARPES, and NMR are highly desirable to further confirm the multiband structure in Fe(Se,S).

## IV Conclusions

In summary, using a AlCl_{3}/KCl flux technique we have grown high quality single crystals of a FeSe_{1-x}S_{x} system (x=0, 0.04, 0.09, and 0.11) and studied their transport, magnetic, and low temperature specific heat properties. We show that the introduction of S to FeSe enhances the upper critical field H_{c2}, critical current density J_{c}, and the T_{c}. The magnetic phase diagram has been studied in the case of magnetic field applied along the c axis and ab plane for x=0.04 and the resulting anisotropy was found to be around \Gamma=H_{c2}^{(ab)}/H_{c2}^{(c)}\sim4. The temperature dependence of the penetration depth and C_{\rm el} can be described neither within single band weak coupling BCS nor using the d-wave approach. Our results, (i) the T

  dependencies of both penetration depth and specific heat, (ii) the kinky in \lambda_{ab}(T), (iii) the large specific heat SC gap values revealed from both probes, (iv) the linear field dependence of \gamma, (vi) the large jump at T_{c}, and (vii) the s-wave scaling of the low-T specific heat data in the mixed state, all indicate the presence of strong-coupling multiband and nodeless superconductivity in FeSe_{1-x}S_{x}. The field-induced change in the low-T specific heat shows a linear magnetic field dependence which is consistent with the s-wave symmetry of the order parameter.

^{13}National the FeSe family is facilitated by electron-phonon interaction. Furthermore, pure magnetic or spin-orbital interactions affect the interband coupling leading to a decrease of thermodynamic T_{c} like in the case of MgB_{2}. Identifying the origin of the SC pairing mechanism is the key to understanding these interesting properties of FeSe. There is no general consensus regarding the nature of pairing at the moment. For instance, the bulk probes, such as specific heat [15], Andreev reflections spectroscopy [16], thermal conductivity [17], and the London penetration depth \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T)[18, 19, 20] point to the existence of two-gap nodeless superconductivity. On the other hand, evidence for nodal superconductivity in FeSe has been reported from the surface-sensitive probes, such as scanning tunneling spectroscopy [21].

In this paper we report on magnetization, resistivity up to 19 T, London penetration depth, and low-temperature specific heat measurements of FeSe_{1-x}S_{x}. Although similar investigations have been performed in detail on analogous compounds, i.e., Fe(Se,Te) [18,19,22,23], such studies are lacking in the case of S-doped FeSe. Exploring the symmetry and structure of the order parameter, and the evolution of the SC gap with S doping in the FeSe_{1-x}S_{x} system through systematic measurements of temperature dependent specific heat and SC penetration depth is thus highly desired. In order to better understand the SC pairing mechanism it is necessary to examine how these properties are affected by a different chemical composition. In the first part we deal with magnetic measurements in magnetic dc fields applied parallel to the c axis. We show that the introduction of S to FeSe enhances the upper critical field H_{c2}, critical current density J_{c}, and the T_{c}. The upper critical fields H_{c2} have been determined from our detailed resistance measurements, ac magnetization, and specific heat studies, yielding a high superconducting anisotropy \Gamma\sim 4 for x=0.04. The anisotropy \Gamma of the critical field is largest close to T_{c} and decreases with decreasing temperature. From the measured temperature dependence of the specific heat, reliable values of the normal-state Sommerfeld coefficients are obtained for these materials. The second part of the paper is devoted to the study of the currently debated issue of the SC pairing symmetry by using high-quality single crystals of FeSe_{1-x}S_{x}. Based on the comprehensive low-T measurements of the magnetic penetration depth and specific heat, we provide evidence for strongly coupled multiband and nodeless superconductivity in the FeSe family. In addition, the presence of multiple kinks in \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) gives strong evidence for the existence of two energy gaps in Fe(Se,S), which implies that several sheets of the Fermi surface contribute to the formation of Cooper pairs. Although the electronic specific heat of the SC state can be well described by using a two-band model, the change of specific heat induced by a magnetic field can be understood only in terms of multiband superconductivity.

## II Experimental details

All preparation steps like weighing, mixing, grinding, and storage were carried out in an Ar-filled glovebox (O_{2} and H_{2}O level less than 0.1 ppm). FeSe_{1-x}S_{x} single crystals were grown in evacuated quartz ampoules using the AlCl_{3}/KCl flux technique in a temperature gradient (a hot part of the ampule at 400 deg degC and a cold part at 350 degC) for 45 days [16]. The chemical composition of crystals was studied with a digital scanning electron microscope TESCAN Vega II XMU [16]. The standard deviation of the average S concentration allows us to judge upon the homogeneity of S within the crystals. Therefore, the composition and in particular the S-doping level was obtained by an average of over several different points of each single crystal. The analysis showed that the approximate chemical compositions are FeSe_{1-x}, Fe(Se_{0.96\pm 0.01}S_{0.04\pm 0.01})_{1-x}, Fe(Se_{0.91\pm 0.01}S_{0.09\pm 0.01})_{1-x}, and Fe(Se_{0.89\pm 0.01}S_{0.11\pm 0.01})_{1-x}. The crystals have a platelike shape with the c axis oriented perpendicular to the crystal plane. The crystals have only a tetragonal \beta-FeSe phase present. The lattice parameters c=(5.52\pm 0.01) A and a=(3.77\pm 0.01) A are found for the FeSe single crystal. The quality of the grown single crystals was investigated by complementary techniques.

Magnetization measurements were performed by using a Quantum Design SQUID. The temperature dependent electronic transport was measured by using a standard four-probe alternating current dc method within a current applied parallel to the ab plane. Electrical contacts parallel to the ab plane were made using thin copper wires attached to the sample with silver epoxy. High field resistance measurements were done using a high field SC magnet up to 21 T manufactured by Cryogenic Ltd. The low-T specific heat was measured in the Quantum Design's Physical Property Measurement System within a T range from 2 to 14 K in magnetic fields of up to H=9 T applied along the c and ab axis of the crystal. During the heat capacity measurements, the sample was cooled to the lowest temperature in the presence of an applied magnetic field [field cooled (FC)] and the specific heat data were collected using the adiabatic thermal relaxation technique.

## III Results and discussions

### **Magnetization**

#### iii.1 **dc** magnetization measurements

In Fig. 1(a) we show the magnetic susceptibility \chi, measured with zero field cooling (ZFC) and FC. T_{c} has been determined from the onset of diamagnetic response to be around \sim8.5, 9.58, 10.1, and 10.7 K for x=0, 0.04, 0.09, and 0.11, respectively. These values are comparable with the resistivity and magnetic data that has been reported for polycrystalline samples [24]. The FC and ZFC data show a sharp diamagnetic signal onset. The SC volume fraction of the crystals is close to 1, thus confirming bulk superconductivity and the high quality of the investigated systems. The clear irreversibility between FC and ZFC measurements is a consequence of a strong vortex trapping mechanism, either by surface barriers or bulk pinning. The fact that the hysteresis loops are symmetric around the M=0 line, points to relatively weak surface barriers and is indicative of strong bulk pinning [25]. This consideration holds for all studied temperatures and investigated samples, even close to T_{c}, and indicates that vortex penetration occurs at a field close to the thermodynamic H_{c1} (corrected by the demagnetization factor). Magnetization curves [Figs. 1(b) and 1(c)] show the presence of a second peak for FeSe_{0.91}S_{0.09} and FeSe_{0.96}S_{0.04} for H\parallel c. The second peak effect has been  studied extensively and its origin may be attributed to various mechanisms. The superconducting hysteresis loops M(H) exhibits no paramagnetic background, which indicates that our investigated samples contain negligible amount of magnetic impurities and all Fe atoms are in a nonmagnetic state of Fe^{2+}. From the irreversibility of the magnetization hysteresis loops in M(H), we have extracted the magnetic field dependence of the critical current density J_{c} at different temperatures [see Fig. 1(d)]. We used Bean's critical state model [26] in which the critical current is constant across the sample and the critical current density in a platelet sample is given by

\[J_{c}=\frac{2\Delta M}{\left[a\left(1-\frac{a}{3b}\right)\right]},\] (1)

where \Delta M=M_{\text{dn}}-M_{\text{up}}, M_{\text{dn}} and M_{\text{up}} are the magnetization values measured on the decreasing and increasing branches of M(H), respectively, and a (cm) and b (cm) are sample sizes perpendicular to the applied field (a<b). Here \Delta M is in electromagnetic units per cubic centimeter and the calculated J_{c} is in ampere per square centimeter. The calculated J_{c} values are summarized in Table 1. Figure 1(e) shows the in-plane resistivity data for x=0, 0.04, 0.09, and 0.11 samples near T_{c}. A sharp SC transition is seen in all of the samples which is in agreement with the magnetization data in Fig. 1(a). Upon cooling the resistivity decreases monotonically and shows a metallic behavior.

#### ac magnetization measurements

Figures 2(a) and 2(b) depict the temperature dependence of the volume ac susceptibilities \chi_{v}^{\prime} for x=0.04 and 0.09, respectively. The measurements were done in an ac field with an amplitude H_{\text{ac}}=5 Oe and a frequency f=1 kHz in dc fields up to 9 T parallel to the c axis. Special care has been taken to correct the magnetization data for the demagnetization factor, where the demagnetization factor has been estimated based on crystal dimensions [27]. In general, ac-susceptibility measurements can be used for an investigation of the flux dynamics in superconductors. The imaginary part \chi_{v}^{\prime\prime} is related

Figure 1: (Color online) (a) The T dependence of the magnetic susceptibility \chi in an external field of 10 Oe applied along the c axis. \chi has been deduced from the dc magnetization measured by following ZFC and FC protocols. (b) and (c) The isothermal magnetization M vs H loops measured at different temperatures ranging from 2 to 9 K up to 9 T applied along the c axis. (d) The T dependence of the critical current density J_{c} values at H=0 for x=0, 0.04, 0.09, and 0.11. (e) The temperature dependence of the in-plane electrical resistivity in zero field and represents a zoom of the resistivity data around the superconducting transition.

  to the energy dissipation in the sample due to vortex motion and the real part \chi_{v}^{\prime} is related to the amount of Meissner currents screening. Both functions depend on the ratio between the skin depth \delta_{s} and the sample dimension L in the direction of the flux penetration. In the normal state \delta_{s}\sim(\rho_{n}/f)^{0.5}, where \rho_{n} is the normal-state resistivity and f is the frequency [28]. In the superconducting state, the skin depth \delta_{s}\propto\lambda_{L} if an external magnetic field is below the first critical field H_{c1}, where \lambda_{L} is the London penetration depth. For magnetic fields above H_{c1}, \delta_{s}\propto L_{B}, where L_{B}\sim B_{\rm ac}/J_{c} is the Bean's penetration depth and J_{c} is the critical-current density. In general, if L\ll\delta_{s} the ac field completely penetrates the sample, although the susceptibility is small. In the opposite case, L\gg\delta_{s}, most of the sample volume is screened. Therefore, 4\pi\,\chi^{\prime}_{v}=-1 and \chi_{v}^{\prime\prime}\to 0.

In accordance with this, the ac-susceptibility data measured at low temperatures confirm the bulk superconductivity of the investigated crystals. The transition temperature T_{c} has been extracted from the bifurcation point between \chi^{\prime}_{v} and \chi^{\prime\prime}_{v}. This point is related to the change in the resistivity due to the superconducting transition. It can be also used for the determination of the temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_{c2} from the ac-susceptibility data measured at various dc fields, see Fig. 4(d). Therefore, the most natural way to investigate the vortex dynamics is to repeat \chi_{\rm ac} vs T scans at a fixed H_{\rm dc} at different frequencies v_{n} in order to employ empirical peak functions around the maxima. Figure 2(c) presents the temperature dependence of the imaginary part of ac susceptibility at various frequencies v_{m} for FeSe. One can clearly see that the peak maxima shifts to a higher temperatures upon increasing the frequency which is apparently due to the motion of vortices. Figure 1(d) shows T_{P} values, the position of the maxima of imaginary part in (c) vs v_{m}. One can notice that, similarly to what was observed in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}[29] and CeFeAsO_{0.92}F_{0.08}[30], the quantity 1/T_{p} presents a frequency dependence over the explored range of v, the explored frequency range at fixed applied field H [H_{\rm ac}=1 Oe and H_{\rm dc}=1 T, see Fig. 2(d)]. The latter phenomenology is well verified for samples x=0,0.04, and 0.09. The dashed line outlines the expected logarithmic trend typical for the thermally activated process according to 1/T_{p}(v_{m})=-\frac{1}{U_{0}}\ln\frac{v_{m}}{v_{0}}. The parameter v_{0} represents an intraband condensate vortex hopping. From the latter equation, it can be observed that the logarithmic behavior of 1/T_{p} is mainly controlled by the parameter U_{0}, playing the role of an effective depinning energy barrier in a thermally activated flux creep model.

### Specific heat

Low-temperature specific heat C_{P}, being equal to the temperature derivative of the entropy S, probes the gap structure of bulk superconductors. The thermodynamic C_{P} measurements complement well the magnetic (\lambda) measurements, since the former is hardly affected by vortex pinning. The information about the pairing symmetry is contained in the C_{\rm el}, which is proportional to the quasiparticle (QP) density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy. First we address the zero-field T-dependent specific heat data of FeSe_{1-x}S_{x} plotted as C_{p}/T vs T [Fig. 3(a)]. A clear sharp anomaly is observed due to the SC phase transition. In order to determine the specific heat related to the SC phase transition we need to estimate the phonon (C_{\rm ph}) and electron (C_{\rm el}) contributions. At low temperatures, C_{\rm el} behaves linearly with temperatures, while C_{\rm ph} varies as C_{\rm ph}\propto T^{3}. In order to improve the reliability at higher temperatures, we use a second term of the harmonic-lattice approximation below 14 K. The data can be well described by C_{\rm el}+C_{\rm ph}=\gamma\,T+\alpha\,T^{3}+\beta\,T^{5} [see the dashed line in Fig. 3(a)], in which the lattice contribution is accounted for by \alpha\,T^{3}+\beta\,T^{5}. The Sommerfield coefficient \gamma_{n} values are 5.3(1), 5.1(0.5), 4.9(0.5), and 4.95 for x=0, 0.04, 0.09, and 0.11, respectively. The estimated universal parameter

Figure 2: (Color online) (a) and (b) Summarize the temperature dependence of the complex ac-susceptibility components 4\pi\,\chi^{\prime}_{v} of x=0.09 and 0.11 measured in an ac field with an amplitude of 5 Oe and a frequency of 1 kHz. The data were collected upon warming in different dc magnetic fields after cooling in a zero magnetic field. (c) The imaginary part of ac susceptibility at various v_{m} for x=0. (d) The values from the position of the maxima of the imaginary part in (c) vs v_{m} for x=0, 0.04, and 0.09.

  \Delta C_{\rm el}/\gamma_{\rm z}T_{c} of the specific heat at T_{c} is \approx2.14, 2.43, 2.2, and 1.95 mJ/mol K^{2} for x = 0, 0.04, 0.09, and 0.11, respectively.

According to the BCS theory, the specific heat jump of a superconductor at T_{c} should follow \Delta C_{p}/\gamma_{\rm z}T_{c} = 1.43 in the weak coupling limit. It is so far well reported that a reduced jump in the specific heat \Delta C_{p}/T_{c} compared to that of a single-band s-wave superconductor might be related to a pronounced multiband character of superconductivity with rather different partial densities of states and gap values [28]. However, jumps of specific heat at T_{c} in these materials show a deviation from the trend established by Bud'ko-Ni-Canfield (BNC) scaling \Delta C_{p}/T_{c}\propto T^{2}[31]. This power law seems to be appropriate for many iron-based superconductors, so far for the 122 systems, i.e., Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} and Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ni_{x})_{2}As_{2}[32]. One of the possible reasons for this universal relation might be a strong pair breaking and the impurity scattering effect in a multiband superconductor [31, 33]. Recently, a specific heat jump shows also a deviation from that trend in FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5}[34]. In addition, the heavily hole-doped superconductors (K,Na)Fe_{2}As_{2} stands out from the other Fe pnictides [35, 36].

From the extracted \gamma_{\rm z} values we have estimated the values of the universal parameter C_{\rm el}/\gamma_{\rm z}T_{c} in Table 1 [Fig. 3(b)]. However, a domelike dependence on doping is seen similar to the one in NaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}As [37] and Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co/Ni_{x})_{2}As_{2}[38, 39]. The values recorded in Fig. 3(b) are larger than the BCS weak-coupling prediction of 1.43. Therefore, we notice that the reduced specific heat jumps are larger than those of optimally doped Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2}[41]. Nevertheless, the values are comparable to those of optimally doped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}[42]. In addition, band-structure calculations in FeSe estimated the value of \gamma_{\rm z} of about 2.2 mJ/mol K^{2}. Since \gamma_{\rm z} = (1 + \lambda_{\rm el-bos})\gamma_{\rm z}, where \lambda_{\rm el-bos} is the total coupling strength between the QP and bosons [43], the \lambda_{\rm el-bos} value is estimated to be \approx1.4. Without any model fitting, the values of normalized specific heat jump and the \lambda_{\rm el-bos} constant have already further confirmed a stronger electron-boson-coupling strength in FeSe_{1-x}S_{x}.

### The upper critical fields H_{\rm c2}(T) and their anisotropy

Figures 3(c) and 3(d) summarize the temperature dependence of the specific heat measured at different applied magnetic fields parallel to the c axis (and parallel to the ab plane) as shown in the insets x = 0.04 and 0.09, respectively. In zero-field specific-heat measurements, a very sharp anomaly is clearly seen. This anomaly is attributed to the SC transition at T_{c}. This specific-heat jump is systematically shifted to lower temperatures upon applying dc magnetic fields of up to 9 T in both orientations. In order to determine the SC transition temperature for each field, an entropy conserving construction has been used. The inset in Fig. 3(e) presents the temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat near the transition temperature at 0.5 T \parallel ab and 2 T \parallel ab data. The results yield an anisotropy of about \Gamma=4 for x = 0.04. The extracted data

The upper inset: Enlarged C_{p}/T vs T plot near the SC transition for x = 0.04. The lines illustrate how C_{p}/T_{c} and T_{c} are estimated. The dashed line is the fitting of the specific heat below 14 K by using C_{p}=\gamma_{\rm z}T+\alpha T^{3}+\beta T^{5}. (b) The doping dependence of the normalized specific heat jump is \Delta C_{p}/\gamma_{\rm z}T_{c} for x = 0, 0.04, 0.09, and 0.11. (c) and (d) Summarize the temperature dependence of the specific heat of x = 0.04 and 0.09, respectively, in various applied magnetic fields up to 9 T parallel to the c axis and parallel to the ab plane as presented in the insets. (e) The temperature dependence of the specific heat of both orientation for 0 and 9 T two data sets with the same T_{c} value for the two directions. The inset highlights the electronic specific heat data after subtracting the phonon contribution for x = 0.04 of the two data sets with the same T_{c} value for the two directions. The data present the 0.5 T B\parallel c and for 2 T B\parallel ab. (f) The temperature dependence of the complex ac-susceptibility components 4\pi\chi^{\prime}_{x} and 4\pi\chi^{\prime}_{v} of x = 0.04 of both orientation for 0 and 9 T measured in an ac field with an amplitude of 5 Oe and a frequency of 1 kHz. The data in (e) and (f) show that the electronic specific heat divided by temperature for B\parallel ab and B\parallel c and the ac susceptibility represents an anisotropy of \Gamma = 4 for S-doping concentration.

  at each field were used to map out the SC phase diagram depicting H_{c2} [see Fig. 4(d)].

The results from the temperature dependent magnetoresistivity measurements on single crystals of FeSe and FeSe_{0.91}S_{0.09} in dc magnetic fields of up to 19 T with the field direction parallel to the c plane are shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. There is pronounced broadening of the SC transition at high fields for H\parallel c. We define the characteristic temperature of the superconducting transition using the T_{c}^{0\%} criteria. The phase diagrams of H_{c2}(T) for x=0, 0.04, and 0.09 are summarized in the main panel of Fig. 4(c). The data points are extracted from magnetoresistivity measurements in fields of up to 19 T as well as from magnetization and specific heat in fields of up to 9 T. The observed small differences between the H_{c2}(T) lines obtained from the specific heat, ac magnetization, and resistance measurements for H\parallel c is not surprising since these methods employ different criteria for the T_{c} determination. Using the data in Fig. 4(c), the upper critical field values at T=0 for the FeSe_{1-x}S_{x} system have been evaluated to be \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{(c)}(0)\simeq 14.8(1), 17.5(1), and 18.5(1) T.

The main panel in Fig. 4(d) shows the temperature dependence of the upper critical field in FeSe single crystals together with the data obtained by Vedeneev _et al._[40], as well as the theoretical estimates using Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg model (WHH) [44]. The inset shows the data for FeSe_{0.96}S_{0.04} together with the WHH prediction. The WHH model describes the behavior of the H_{c2}(T) in conventional single gap BCS type-II superconductors without spin paramagnetic and spin-orbit effects (\alpha=0,\lambda_{\infty}=0) [44]. Here \alpha is the Maki parameter which describes the relative strength of orbital pair breaking and the limit of paramagnetism. \lambda_{\infty} (when \lambda_{\infty}>0, the effect of the spin-paramagnetic term) is the spin-orbit coupling strength. The orbital limiting field H_{c2}^{\rm orb} at zero temperature is determined by the slope of H_{c2}(T) at T_{c} as \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\rm orb}=0.69\ T_{c}\ (\alpha\mu_{0}H_{c2}/\Omega T)|_{T_{c}}. It is evident that the single-band WHH model fails to extrapolate to the measured values of H_{c2}(0). Therefore, we believe that the observed deviation from the single band WHH model is related to multiband effects present in the FeSe system. This behavior is reminiscent of the one reported in other Fe-based superconductors [28] in which similar H_{c2}(T) curves were well described by a multiband effect. This claim is further supported by the indications of a two-band-like behavior from the zero-field specific heat measurements and the London penetration depth discussed below.

In all of the investigated S-doped samples, both specific heat and ac-susceptibility measurements at 9 T in the H\parallel ab plane data show a sharper transition compared to the 9 T data \parallel c, indicating a highly anisotropic crystal [see Figs. 3(e) and 3(f)]. From the behavior of H_{c2} vs T in different field orientations we calculate the anisotropy \Gamma=H_{c2}^{B\perp c}/H_{c2}^{B\parallel c} using a linear interpolation. The results are outlined in the inset of Fig. 4(c). Our data allow tracking of \Gamma up to temperatures very close to T_{c}. \Gamma increases upon approaching T_{c} and reaches a value of about 4 at the critical temperature for x=0.04. This finding is in contrast to the results found in other Fe-based superconductors, which suggest a saturation or even a decrease of \Gamma close to T_{c}[45]. This indicates that an orbital pair breaking dominates the suppression of superconductivity close to T_{c}. At lower temperatures, the isotropic Zeeman pair breaking becomes more important, which leads to lowering of \Gamma. Moreover, the strong T-dependent superconducting anisotropy \Gamma=H_{c2}^{B\perp c}/H_{c2}^{B\parallel c} provides further evidence for a multiband scenario as in the case of the two-band superconductor MgB_{2}[46]. Surprisingly, this anisotropy is considerably larger than the typical values of \Gamma\sim 2 and 2.6 found in nearly optimally hole-doped (BaK)Fe_{2}As_{2}[47] and in FeSe_{0.45}Te_{0.55}[48] (T_{c}=14.5 K), but lower than the ones in SmFeAsO_{0.85}F_{0.15} and La(O,F)FeAs thin films [49, 50]. On the other hand, these values are comparable to \Gamma values of, e.g., KFe_{2}As_{2}[28] and LaFePO [51].

### Superconducting energy-gap structure

#### iii.4.1 London penetration depth

The London penetration depth \lambda is a fundamental parameter characterizing the SC condensate and probes the gap structure of bulk superconductors. The T dependence of \lambda is directly determined by the gap function \Delta(T). \lambda(T)=\lambda(T=0)+\delta\lambda(T) behaves as \delta\lambda(T)\propto\exp(\frac{-\Delta}{\delta_{T}T}) at low T reflecting a nodelsss superconducting gap \Delta with s-wave symmetry. In a d-wave pairing scenario containing line nodes, \delta\lambda(T)\propto T at low T in the clean limit. The experimental determination of the London penetration depth \lambda(0) via measurement of the lower critical field H_{c1} is challenging since H_{c1} is an equilibrium thermodynamic field. The temperature dependence of the SC penetration depth provides another method for detecting the existence of multiple gaps [52, 53]. A popular approach to measuring H_{c1} is by tracking the virgin M(H) curve at low fields and identifying the deviation from the linear Meissner response which would correspond to the first vortex penetration (see Fig. 5). This technique implicitly relies on the assumption that no surface barriers are present. We have confirmed the absence of the surface barriers in our case from the very symmetric dc magnetization hysteresis curves M(H) [see Figs. 1(b) and 1(c) and the inset in Fig. 5(a)]. On the other hand, if surface barriers were predominant, the first vortex entrance would occur at much higher field (\simH_{c}). Thus absence of surface barriers is very important for obtaining reliable estimates of the thermodynamic lower critical field. The transition from linear to nonlinear M(H) was determined by a user-independent procedure consisting of calculating the regression coefficient R of a linear fit to the data points collected between 0 and H, as a function of H (see the insets in Fig. 5). In contrast to tracking the virgin M(H) curve at low fields at several temperatures, in which case a heavy data post-processing is needed (see Fig. 5 ), here a careful measurement protocol needs to be followed with little data analysis. Indeed, the H_{c1} values from the virgin magnetization data are close to those obtained from the onset of the trapped flux moment M_{t} [see the inset in Fig. 6(e)]. Here M_{t} is obtained by following sequence: (i) warming the sample up to temperatures above T_{c}, i.e., 12 K, then (ii) cooling the sample in zero field down to the particular T, and subsequently (iii) increasing the applied magnetic field to a certain maximum value H_{m}, and in a last step (iv) measuring the remanent magnetization M_{t} after the applied field has been removed. The field H_{m} at which M_{t} deviates from zero determines the H_{c1} value at the desired temperature. Then, the extrapolation  \sqrt{M_{t}}\to 0 determines the exact value of the H_{c1}. The inset of Fig. 6(e) presents the typical plot of \sqrt{M_{t}} vs the applied field H, for FeSe_{0.96}S_{0.04} single crystals. The solid line is a linear fit to the high-field data of \sqrt{M_{t}} vs H. H_{c1} is determined by intercept of the fit with the abscissa.

The above measured values of H_{c1} need to be corrected due to the finite demagnetization effects. Indeed, the deflection of field lines around the sample leads to a more pronounced Meissner slope given by M/H_{a}=-1/(1-N), where N is the demagnetization factor. Taking into account these effects, the absolute value of H_{c1} can be estimated by using the relation proposed by Brandt [54]. For our samples we find N\approx 0.96, 0.95, 0.97, and 0.96 for FeSe_{0.96}S_{0.04}, FeSe_{0.91}S_{0.09}, FeSe_{0.89}S_{0.11}, and FeSe, respectively. In order to shed light on the pairing symmetry in our system, we estimated the penetration depth using the traditional Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory, where H_{c1} is given by \mu_{0}H_{c1}^{\mathrm{f}c1}=(\phi_{0}/4\pi\lambda_{ab}^{2})\ln\kappa_{c}, where \phi_{0} is the magnetic-flux quantum \phi_{0}=h/e^{*}=2.07\times 10^{-7} Oe cm^{2}, and \kappa_{c}=\lambda_{ab}/\xi_{ab} is the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. The value of \kappa was determined from the equation \frac{2H_{c1}(0)}{H_{c2}(0)}=\frac{\ln\kappa_{c}+0.5}{\kappa^{2}}. It should be mentioned that the SC penetration depth is a very important physical quantity and it is sensitive to the absolute value of the order parameter(s); and, in that sense, also sensitive to any nodes or a deep local minima of the gap. It is worth mentioning that the SC penetration depth is also dependent on the distribution of Fermi velocities. In this context it is most sensitive to fast electrons in sharp contrast to the upper critical field which is highly sensitive to the subgroup of electrons with low Fermi velocities.

In Figs. 6(d)-6(f) we analyze the temperature dependence of the London penetration depth for the samples with x=0, 0.04, and 0.09, respectively. We compare our data to the d wave and single-gap BCS theory under the weak-coupling approach [see dotted and dashed lines in Figs. 6(d)-6(f)]. Indeed, both quantities lead to a rather different trend and show a systematic deviation from the data in the whole T range below T_{c}. On the other hand, we also apply a phenomenological two-gap model which is in line with the multigap superconductivity reported by Carrington and Manzano [55]. Within this model the temperature dependence of each energy gap can be approximated as [55, 56, 57]\Delta_{i}(T)=\Delta_{i}(0)tanh\{1.82[1.018(\frac{T_{ab}}{T}-1)]^{0.51}\}. According to Ref. [58], for each band, \lambda_{i}^{-2}(T) is given by

\[\lambda_{i}^{-2}(T)=\frac{\Delta_{i}(T)\mathrm{tanh}\left(\frac{\Delta_{i}(T) }{2\mu_{0}T}\right)}{\lambda_{i}^{2}(0)\Delta_{i}(0)},\] (2)

where \lambda_{i}(0) is the residual penetration depth for each band and k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant. Considering different partial contributions of each band to the overall \lambda(T), we use the following expression: \lambda^{-2}(T)=r\lambda_{1}^{-2}(T)+(1-r)\lambda_{2}^{-2}(T), with r being the weighting factor indicating the contribution of the small gap. The best description of the experimental data is obtained using values of \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.72\pm 0.3, 1.79\pm 0.25, and 0.79\pm 0.15 and \Delta_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}=2.28\pm 0.3, 2.1\pm 0.25, and 1.95\pm 0.2 for x=0.09, 0.04, and 0, respectively. The weighting factor is found to be around r=0.25\pm 0.08, 0.38\pm 0.1, and 0.22\pm 0.2 for x=0, 0.04, and 0.09, respectively. The fits are represented by solid red lines in Figs. 6(d)-6(f). The extracted gap values for FeSe are comparable to those obtained from the two-band s-wave fit of the specific heat data and the Andreev reflection spectroscopy results [15, 16]. It is worth pointing out that the \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) of the SC samples [see the inset of Fig. 6(d)] does not saturate at low temperatures, as it could be expected for a fully gapped clean s-wave superconductor. \lambda_{ab}(T) is nearly constant at low temperatures, which demonstrates negligible quasiparticle excitations. The above penetration depth results are consistent with the presence of two s-wave-like gaps. Both gap values in the S-doped samples are considerably larger than the BCS weak-coupling limit. These observations show clearly that there are no nodes in the SC energy gap indicating a strong-coupling multiband (and nodeless) superconductivity in iron chalcogenide Fe(Se,S) superconductors. A similar possible strong coupling multiband superconductivity in Fe(Se,Te) has been conjectured from a detailed penetration depth and specific heat experiments [22, 23]. The temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth of d-wave SC gap calculations was

  performed by using the following functional form [18, 20]:

\[\frac{\lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T)}{\lambda_{ab}^{-2}(0)}=1+\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{\Delta(T,\varphi)}^{\infty}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial E}\right)\frac {EdEd\varphi}{\sqrt{E^{2}-\Delta(T,\varphi)^{2}}},\] (3)

where f=[1+\exp(E/k_{B}T)]^{-1} is the Fermi function, \varphi is the angle a long the Fermi surface, and \Delta(T,\varphi)=\Delta_{0}\delta(T/T_{c})g(\varphi) (\Delta_{0} is the maximum gap value at T=0). The function g(\varphi) is given by g^{d}(\varphi)=|\cos(2\varphi)| for the d-wave gap. The results of the analysis are presented in Figs. 6(d)-6(f) by dotted lines. The fit of the experimental data for the d-wave case we get for \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=2.8, 2.36, and 3.05 for x=0, 0.04, and 0.09. It is obvious that the d-wave case cannot describe the penetration depth data. On the other hand, the experimental data are well described by the two-gap s-wave models.

It is noteworthy that in a FeTe_{0.58}Se_{0.42} system, a careful analysis of the SC and normal state properties indicates a possibility of strong coupling superconductivity [59]. This study is followed by precise measurements of the temperature dependence of the London penetration depth by Cho _et al._ Their analysis strongly suggests a presence of two s-wave-like gaps with magnitudes \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.93 and \Delta_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}=0.9[60]. These two precise measurements [59, 60] were followed by the comment of Klein _et al._[61] and response of Cho _et al._[62]. In the latter case, the authors have shown convincingly that previous studies [22] most likely have issues with pair-breaking scattering. The authors have reported that the presence of strong scattering hinders any determination of gap values from the temperature dependence of the superfluid density.

#### iii.2.2 Specific heat

The normalized zero-field data C_{\rm el}/\nu_{\rm s}T as a function of the reduced temperature T/T_{c}, obtained after subtracting the C_{\rm ph}, is presented in Figs. 6(a)-6(c) together with the fits to various models. It is obvious from Figs. 6(a)-6(c) that the SC transition at T_{c} is well pronounced, with a sharp jump in C_{\rm el} at T_{c}. The entropy conservation required for a second-order phase transition is fulfilled as shown in Fig. 6(b). This check warrants the thermodynamic consistency for both: the measured data and the determination of C_{\rm el}. We have attempted best fits to the data using three different models: single-band weak-coupling BCS theory with the s-wave gap \Delta_{(0)}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.76; a d-wave calculation using \Delta=\Delta_{(0)}\cos(2\phi); and two-gap s wave in Figs. 6(a)-6(c). Below T_{c} we observe a systematic deviation of both single-gap and the d-wave fit from the data showing a higher jump at T_{c} than the s-wave model. Thus we focus our discussion on the possibility of two SC energy gaps using the generalized \alpha model that explains the specific heat behavior in multiband superconductors [63]. The corresponding fits are shown in Figs. 6(a)-6(c). Although the two-gap model contains two distinct gaps, the specific heat value is calculated as the sum of contributions, each one following the BCS-type temperature dependence \Delta(0)=\gamma_{1}\Delta_{1}(0)+\gamma_{2}\Delta_{2}(0)[63] and the thermodynamic properties are obtained as the sum of the contributions from the individual bands, i.e., \alpha_{1}=\Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c} and \alpha_{2}=\Delta_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}.

The estimated \Delta_{1}(0)/k_{B}T_{c} for the small gap for x=0, 0.04, and 0.09 is 0.88\pm 0.1, 1.9\pm 0.2, and 2.2\pm 0.2, while the large gap \Delta_{2}(0)/k_{B}T_{c} is found to be 2.2\pm 0.2, 2.5\pm 0.2, and 2.35\pm 0.2, for x=0, 0.04, and 0.09, respectively. The calculated data and the relative weights are illustrated as red lines in Figs. 6(a)-6(c). The error bars represents the width of the corresponding range of gap amplitudes obtained in the fit for both values of \Delta_{1}(0)/k_{B}T_{c} and \Delta_{2}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}. The results obtained in the present work are consistent with ones of the models considered in Ref. [15]. The ratio of the two gaps [\Delta_{1}(0)/\Delta_{2}(0) is \approx0.7 and 0.9 for x=0.04 and 0.09, respectively] is comparable to the FeSe_{0.43}Te_{0.57} case and it is noticeably larger than in iron pnictide superconductors (between 0.24 and 0.5) [41, 42]. All of the fitting parameters are remarkably consistent with those obtained from the penetration depth measurements. They give strong evidence for a two-gap SC at a Fe(Se,S) system. It has been theoretically

The inset of (a) presents the magnetic field dependence of magnetization in FeSe_{0.93}S_{0.09} single crystal at different temperatures close to T_{c}. The insets in (b) and (c) depict an example used to determine the H_{c1} value using the regression factor R, at T=2 K.

  demonstrated that in multiband superconductors if the ratio of two isotropic s-wave gaps \Delta_{1}(0)/\Delta_{2}(0)>0.5, the field-induced low energy excitations would be less pronounced compared to a single-band s-wave symmetry [64]. In this respect, in the low field range \gamma(H) would slowly increase with H (see Fig. 7). As mentioned above, our obtained ratio of the two gaps is higher compared to the critical value of 0.5 suggested by the theory, which further confirms the multiband nature in Fe(Se,S). In addition, the obtained two gaps of both S-doped samples are consistent with the penetration depth results and larger than the BCS value in the weak-coupling regime. Overall, such a behavior confirms the strong coupling nodeless superconductivity in Fe(Se,S).

Next, we discuss the field dependence of specific heat, which is another independent, sensitive test of the gap structure. It has been well demonstrated that in the case of an isotropic s-wave superconductor, \gamma(H)\propto H because the specific heat in the vortex state is dominated by the contribution from the localized QP in the vortex core. Recently, Storey _et al._[65] pointed out that the number of Caroli-de Genne bound states increases linearly with the field due to the linear increase in the number of vortices entering the sample. On the other hand, for the line nodes \gamma(H)\propto H^{0.5}, the QPs contributing to the DOS come from regions away from the vortex core and close to the nodes and supercurrents around the vortex core in the mixed state causing a Doppler shift of the QP excitation spectrum [66]. The temperature dependence of the low-T part of the specific heat data measured in various magnetic fields applied along the c axis is shown in the lower inset of Fig. 7. The data plotted as C_{p}/T vs T^{2} fits to C_{p}/T=\gamma_{n}+\beta T^{2}, with \gamma_{n} and \beta as electronic and lattice coefficients, respectively. It should be mentioned that the absence of the so-called \gamma_{r} at the linear-T term of the zero-field specific heat indicates high quality of the single crystals. Nearly perfect linear behavior without any magnetic impurities have been observed in our samples (see Fig. 7). The applied magnetic field enhances the low-T specific heat, indicating the increase of the QP DOS at the Fermi level induced by a magnetic field. A linear extrapolation of the low-T data to zero temperature yields the field dependence of the field-induced contribution. The main panel of Fig. 7 presents the field dependence of the specific heat coefficient. The dashed lines are linear fits for H\parallel c above H=1 T as anticipated for a case of nodeless SC gap.

The inset in (b) presents the entropy in the normal and SC state as a function of T. (d)–(f) The temperature dependence of the London penetration depth for x=0, 0.04, and 0.09, respectively. The inset in (d) presents the temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depths \lambda_{ab} vs T. The inset of (e) depicts an example used to determine the H_{c1} value using the trapped moment at T=2 K of the typical plot of \sqrt{M_{r}} vs H. The solid red line is a linear fit to the high-field data of \sqrt{M_{r}} vs H. H_{c1} values are determined by extrapolating the linear fit to \sqrt{M_{r}}=0. The inset in (f) represents the phase diagram of H_{c1} for the field applied along the c axis. The dashed lines represent the theoretical curves based on single-band weak-coupling BCS theory, while the dotted lines represent the d-wave approximation. The solid lines represent the curves of the two s-wave gap model.

  Further confirmation of the nodeless character of superconductivity in our investigated systems comes from the low temperature specific heat data of the finite-temperature region in the mixed state. In fact, the quasiparticle excitations in superconductors with different gap symmetries are obviously distinct. In s-wave superconductors, the inner-core states dominate quasiparticle excitations and a simple scaling law proposed by Liu _et al._ holds in the case of possible s-wave gap in Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{4}[67]:

\[C_{\rm QP}/T^{3}\approx C_{\rm core}/T^{3}=_{\gamma}n/H_{c2}(0)(T/\sqrt{H})^{ -2},\] (4)

where C_{\rm QP} and C_{\rm core} are the specific heat of quasiparticles induced by the applied magnetic field and quasiparticles present inside from the Abrikosov vortex cores in the mixed state, respectively. The s-wave scenario of the scaling result of the field-induced term in the mixed state is presented in the upper inset of Fig. 7. All the data at different magnetic fields can be roughly scaled within the s-wave scenario in one line.

For the sake of comparison, in Table 1 we have summarized the superconducting parameters for the investigated samples extracted from this study. According to Fig. 1(d) and Table 1, with increasing S content the critical current density, which is a measure of the strength of the pinning force density and can be very conveniently used to characterize the strength of disorder in the system, enhances, suggesting improved flux pinning in those samples. The absolute value of the penetration depth in the T\to 0 limit determined for FeSe_{0.96}S_{0.04}, FeSe_{0.91}S_{0.09}, and FeSe, yields \lambda_{ab}(0)=372(15), 433(15), and 446(15) nm, respectively. These values are somewhat smaller than 560(20) nm found in Fe(Te,Se) [22], but comparable to the FeSe_{0.85} and FeSe [18, 19]. In Figs. 6(d)-6(f) a kink structure is observed on the \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) curves. This kink in \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) can be associated with the two-band superconductivity as in the cases of Fe(Te,Se), Ba_{0.6}_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2}, and MgB_{2}[22, 68, 69]. The upper critical field H_{c2} for the S-doped FeSe sample increases with increased doping, which is mainly due to its enhanced T_{c}. From \gamma_{n} values we estimate the universal parameter \Delta C_{\rm el}/\gamma_{n}T_{c}, which is considerably higher than the prediction of the weak coupling BCS theory (\Delta C_{\rm el}/\gamma_{n}T_{c}=1.43). Taking into account the fact that the superconducting transition is relatively sharp [see Figs. 6(a)-6(c)], a distribution in T_{c} or the presence of impurity phases cannot explain the higher value of the universal parameter. We believe that the presence of strong coupling superconductivity explain this higher values. Most remarkably, the specific-heat data allows for precise evaluation of SC volume fraction (V_{\rm SC}), i.e., V_{\rm SC}=(\gamma_{n}-\gamma_{\gamma})/\gamma_{n}, with \gamma_{\gamma} being the residual electronic specific-heat coefficient. Since our \gamma_{\gamma} is almost absent (see lower inset in Fig. 7), V_{\rm SC} estimated from specific heat is in fair agreement with our magnetization data [see Fig. 1(a)]. The overall values of the investigated superconducting gap derived from specific heat is similar to the one obtained from the penetration depth. However, both large gap \Delta_{L} and smaller one \Delta_{S} upon doping present a higher value than the weak-coupling BCS (1.76k_{B}T_{c}) gap value, which reflects a tendency for strong coupling effects. This is inconsistent with the theoretical constraints of the weakly coupled two-band superconductor model in which one gap must be larger than the BCS gap and one smaller [70].

Although rather large single or multiple gap values were reported in Fe(Se,Te) from specific heat [23], penetration depth [22], and ARPES [71] suggesting strong-coupling multiband superconductivity, the pairing symmetry in Fe(Se,Te) is still under debate. Additionally, two independent reports of penetration depth measurements [72] and scanning tunneling microscopy [73] in Fe_{1+y}(Te_{1-x}Se_{x}) have claimed the possibility of nodes in the SC gap. Interestingly, near optimal doping FeSe_{0.45}Te_{0.55}, specific heat measurements demonstrate isotropic gap behavior under zero magnetic field but anisotropic/nodal gaps under magnetic field [23, 48]. Our data show that the Fe(Se,S) system belongs to the class of multiband superconductors, in the strong-coupling regime. Given the substantial divergency of the existing data on the gap values and the gap symmetry for FeSe-based superconductors, a combination of several independent techniques rather than a single technique is highly desirable. In the current paper we presented self-consistent data obtained from both lower critical field H_{c1} and specific heat measurements. We believe that other techniques such as \muSR, ARPES, and NMR are highly desirable to further confirm the multiband structure in Fe(Se,S).

## IV Conclusions

In summary, using a AlCl_{3}/KCl flux technique we have grown high quality single crystals of a FeSe_{1-x}S_{x} system (x=0, 0.04, 0.09, and 0.11) and studied their transport, magnetic, and low temperature specific heat properties. We show that the introduction of S to FeSe enhances the upper critical field H_{c2}, critical current density J_{c}, and the T_{c}. The magnetic phase diagram has been studied in the case of magnetic field applied along the c axis and ab plane for x=0.04 and the resulting anisotropy was found to be around \Gamma=H_{c2}^{(ab)}/H_{c2}^{(c)}\sim4. The temperature dependence of the penetration depth and C_{\rm el} can be described neither within single band weak coupling BCS nor using the d-wave approach. Our results, (i) the T

The dashed lines represent the phenomenological linear fits above H=1 T. The upper inset presents the scaling of the data according to the s-wave scenario C_{\rm cal,-x}=[C(H)-C(0)]/T^{3} vs T/\sqrt{H}. The lower inset shows the specific heat of FeSe_{0.96}S_{0.04} plotted as C_{p}/T vs T^{2} measured under various magnetic fields up to 9 T in the low temperature region. The solid lines show a linear extrapolation of the data.

  dependencies of both penetration depth and specific heat, (ii) the kinky in \lambda_{ab}(T), (iii) the large specific heat SC gap values revealed from both probes, (iv) the linear field dependence of \gamma, (vi) the large jump at T_{c}, and (vii) the s-wave scaling of the low-T specific heat data in the mixed state, all indicate the presence of strong-coupling multiband and nodeless superconductivity in FeSe_{1-x}S_{x}. The field-induced change in the low-T specific heat shows a linear magnetic field dependence which is consistent with the s-wave symmetry of the order parameter.
