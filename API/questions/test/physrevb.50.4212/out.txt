The value and temperature dependence of the lower critical field _H__c_1 of high-_T_c superconductors have special importance in superconductivity theories. _H__c_1 is proportional to C1 (_H__c_1 = 4_p_d_1/Ph0), where C1 is the free energy per unit length of an isolated vortex and depends on the current distribution around the vortex, and hence on the penetration depth and on the core energy, i.e., the free-energy cost of the reduction of the order parameter in the core.1 In spite of numerous studies, the experimental results for _H__c_1 are still very confused. For YBa2Cu3O2-_x_, the reported low-temperature _H__c_1 values range from 400 to 8000 Oe and from 70 to 600 Oe for the field parallel and perpendicular to the c axis, respectively.2-9 The temperature dependence below 0.5_T_c is even more controversial: some results show a conventional saturation behavior6,8 while others show an unusual upturn at lower temperatures.3,5 A linear temperature dependence has also been reported.7

The lower critical field _H__c_1 marks the onset of the mixed state and has been conventionally determined by measuring the field at which the first Abrikosov vortex penetrates. However, due to the strong bulk pinning in high-_T_c superconductors, vortex lines penetrate into the sample very reluctantly and this makes the determination of _H__c_1 difficult. The problem is worse if the sample has an imperfect demagnetization geometry (i.e., nonellipsoidal shape), for then vortex penetration starts at sharp corners and edges at an even lower field than _H__c_1, and so broadens out the true _H__c_1 point. Nevertheless, until now determinations of _H__c_1 for YBa2Cu3O7-_x_ have been done on slab-shaped samples with sharp corners and edges. In addition, the Bean-Livingston (BL) surface barrier10 may push the first penetration field to a value much higher than _H__c_1.1 The combination of the surface barrier and the effects of sharp corners and edges very likely explains the large discrepancies among previous results.

In this paper, we report _H__c_1 data on an ellipsoid-shaped high-quality YBa2Cu3O6.95 single crystal, determined by magnetization _M_(_H_) measurements. The _M_(_H_) data were analyzed by the extended Bean critical-state models, both excluding and including the BL surface barrier. We show that the results are not affected by the surface barrier and are therefore a reliable measure of _H__c_1(_T_).

High-quality YBa2Cu3O6.95 single crystals were grown by a CuO-BaO flux method using zirconia crucibles as reported elsewhere.12 We used two crystals. One was polished using 1 _m_m alumina powder and _n_-heptane into a nearly ellipsoidal shape with the shortest axis 0.61 mm along the c axis, as shown in Fig. 1, and was free of visible cracks under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The surface roughness was on the submicrometer scale. After polishing, the crystal was annealed at 860 degC for 48 h and then reoxygenated at 450 degC for 1 week. The other crystal was a thin plate 1.5 x 0.4 x 0.075 mm3 with the shortest dimension along the c axis. The two crystals

The crystal was deliberately left with small residual flat regions for purposes of orientation.

  came from the same growth batch and were always annealed together. They had the same T_c = 93.05 K and \Delta T_c \approx 0.3 K, as determined by field-cooling magnetization measurement at 2 Oe. The ellipsoidal crystal, used for **H**\|c measurements, had a measured demagnetization factor n = 0.345 \pm 0.005 (the calculated n value was 0.347), whereas the thin plate used for **H**\|c had n \approx 0.026.

The crystals were first cooled in zero field to a chosen temperature, and then the magnetization M(H) was measured with increasing H using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. The shift from perfect shielding, \delta M(H), was then calculated by subtracting the straight-line fit to the low-field part of M(H) from the raw M(H) data. For all temperatures other than the lowest (10 K), the data are well described by the Bean critical-state model without surface barrier. In particular, for T \geq 20 K the data have almost no rounding near the first penetration field H_p, which can be determined simply by eye, without using extrapolation techniques commonly used in previous experiments.4-9 The 20-K data (**H**\|c) are shown in the inset to Fig. 2; H_p is increasingly better defined at higher T.

The 10-K data point requires closer scrutiny. According to the Bean critical-state model13 for type-II hard superconductors,7,14\delta M is essentially zero below H_e1 and

\[4\pi\delta M = A(H - H_e1)^2/H^*\;\;\;(H_e1 < H < H^*)\;,\]

where A is a constant related to the shape of the sample and H^* a parameter proportional to the critical current density J_c. For this work, the maximum field used was estimated to be less than one-tenth of H^*. However, a plot of (\delta M)^{1/2} vs H for **H**\|c at 10 K (Fig. 2) shows not a single straight line but a region of slow penetration followed by a more rapid increase with H. Similar behavior has been reported by Naito _et al._14 for (La_{1-x}Sr_{x})_{2}CuO_{4} samples and they explained the initially slow increase of \delta M as the vortex penetration into sharp corners and edges. Such edges and corners are not present in our case, and we believe that we are starting to see the effect of surface barriers (i.e., J_c is larger near the surface than inside). \delta M first increases slowly because of the existence of the surface barrier and then increases rapidly when the surface barrier is diminished by the applied field. Therefore, H_e1 is equal to or lower than H_p, the threshold of the lower straight line, rather than the higher threshold field obtained commonly by extrapolating down from higher fields.

The question is, if there exists a surface barrier, can we still take H_e1 as the first penetration field H_p or not? The BL surface barrier pushes H_p from H_e1 to H_e/\sqrt 2 for a perfect surface at 0 K,10 where H_e is the thermodynamic critical field. In conventional superconductors, experimental observation of The BL surface barrier requires highly polished surfaces because strong local fields caused by the surface roughness destroy the surface barrier and result in H_p = H_e1. However, in high-T_c superconductors, the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter \kappa is of order 100, and H_e is so much larger than H_e1 that local fields may not be strong enough to completely destroy the surface barrier, resulting in H_e/\sqrt 2 > H_p > H_e1. Burlachkov _et al._8 have included the BL surface barrier in the Bean critical-state model. They supposed that vortices start to penetrate into the sample at distinct points at the surface where the barrier is suppressed by defects such as surface roughness and twin boundaries, and obtained

\[\delta M = C[(1 - m)H_e1(H - H_e1)^2/2 + (H - H_e1)^3/6]\] (2) \[= C[(H - H_e1)^2[H - (3 m - 2)H_e1]\;/6\;,\]

where C is a constant related to the shape and critical current density of the sample and m is the ratio of equilibrium magnetization M over the maximum magnetization M(H_e1). They also estimated m \approx 0.7 for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - 8} (YBCO) (\kappa \approx 100). Putting m = 0.7 Eq. (2) yields

\[\delta M \approx C[(H - H_e1)^2H]/6\]

or

\[(\delta M/H)^{1/2} \propto H - H_e1\;.\]

This means that a plot of (\delta M/H)^{1/2} vs H gives a straight line with a threshold at H_e1. Even in the case where the surface barrier is not completely destroyed but rather just diminished at distinct surface defects so that vortex penetration starts at H_p > H_e1, Eq. (2) [and so Eq. (4)] still holds in the region somewhat above H_p because the surface barrier diminishes quickly after the first vortex entry. Therefore, H_e1 can always be obtained by extrapolation of the linear part of the curve to (\delta M/H)^{1/2} = 0. In Fig. 3 we have replotted the 10-K data shown in Fig. 2 in the form of (\delta M/H)^{1/2}. As is seen, (\delta M/H)^{1/2} is roughly linear with H above H_p, and

Figure 2: Plots of (4\pi\delta M)^{1/2} vs H for the ellipsoidal crystal with **H**\|c at 10 K and 20 K (inset). At 10 K, above the first penetration field H_p, (4\pi\delta M)^{1/2} first increases slowly and then more sharply. The initial slow increase is attributed to the existence of a surface barrier. At 20 K, (4\pi\delta M)^{1/2} is almost linear in H above H_p, consistent with the prediction of the Bean critical-state model without the surface barrier.

  the linear fit gives H_{c1}\!\approx\!H_{p}. This confirms that, in our case, H_{p}\!=\!H_{c1} and the surface barrier does not push H_{p} higher than H_{c1} but only lowers the rate of vortex entry. Surface roughness of submicrometer order seems to be very effective in destroying the surface barrier. At higher temperature, the surface barrier is further diminished by thermal activation.

The results are summarized in Fig. 4, where we show the temperature dependence of H_{c1} for both {\bf H}\|c and H\bot c. At temperatures below \sim\!0.5T_{c}, we see neither conventional saturation nor upturn, but essentially a linear temperature dependence with slopes of 10 and 1.9 Oe/K for {\bf H}\|c and {\bf H}\bot c, respectively. This is qualitatively different from the saturation at low temperatures expected for a conventional _s_-wave BCS superconductor [15] and is consistent with an energy gap with line nodes, [16] as predicted by models that lead to _d_-wave superconductivity. [17] It is worth mentioning that, although the model of quasi-two-dimensional superconducting sheets alternating with normal layers [18] can also explain the lack of the saturation in H_{c1} at low temperatures, it produces a temperature dependent \gamma\!=\!H_{c1}^{1}/H_{c1}^{1} that is inconsistent with our observations in YBa_{\rm c}Cu_{3}O_{6.95}. The anisotropy factor \gamma that we observed is almost temperature independent and has the value 5.6\!\pm\!0.3, consistent with the values 5\!-\!6 estimated for H_{c2} measurements. [19] This is larger than the values 3\!-\!4 in previous H_{c1} measurements [4, 5, 6, 7] made on slab-shaped samples with the shortest dimensions along the c axis. Sharp corners and edges in the slab geometry likely lead to underestimation of H_{c1}^{1} and \gamma. We emphasize that the temperature independence of \gamma is a strong corroborating evidence that we have measured the true H_{c1} rather than a surface-condition-dependent first entry field, because, first, the surface barriers in the two directions are highly unlikely to be the same, and secondly, the ellipsoid and the thin plate crystal have completely different surface roughnesses.

The experimental value for H_{c1} is surprisingly large compared to what one might expect from Ginzburg-Landau theory. In general, the vortex line energy, {\cal E}_{1}\!=\!\Phi_{0}H_{c1}/(4\pi) is a sum of two parts, [1]

\[{\cal E}_{1}\!=\!E_{\rm em}\!+\!E_{\rm core}\ ,\] (5)

where, for a large-\kappa material,

The H_{c1}’s are linear with temperature below 0.5T_{c}, with slopes of 10.0\pm0.3 and 1.9\pm0.1 Oe/K for {\bf H}\|c and {\bf H}\bot c, respectively. Extrapolation of the data to zero temperature yields H_{c1}^{1}(0)\!=\!1100\!\pm\!50 Oe and H_{c1}^{1}(0)\!=\!200\!\pm\!20 Oe. The inset shows the data near T_{c} in detail.

Figure 3: Plot of (4\pi\delta M/H)^{1/2} vs H replotted from the 10-K data shown in Fig. 2. Above the first penetration field H_{p}, the data are roughly linear with H and the linear fit gives threshold H_{c1}\!=\!H_{p}. This confirms that the surface barrier does not increase H_{p} beyond H_{c1}.

  \[E_{\rm em}=\left[\frac{\Phi_{0}}{4\pi\lambda}\right]^{2}{\rm ln}\kappa\] (6)

is the energy of the magnetic field and of the supercurrent associated with the vortex. In GL theory for an _s_-wave superconductor,[21] the effect of the core energy is to add a term of order 0.5 to lna, which is negligible if k is large, as it is for YBCO (_k_  70). Assigning all of the vortex energy to _E_em and using H_{c1}^{\dagger}(0) = 1100 Oe implies \lambda_{ab}(0) \approx 800 A, in serious disagreement with the value of 1400 A by _mSR_ and infrared measurements.[22, 23] This comparison suggests that the core energy of an isolated vortex in YBa2Cu3O6.95 is substantially larger than one would expect for a conventional superconductor. In fact, using the value of \lambda_{ab}(0) \approx 1400 A from muon spin resonance (_mSR_)[22] and infrared[23] measurements and D_l_ab_(_T_) from microwave measurement[20] allows us to determine _E_em and hence to extract the core energy _E_core, over the entire temperature range 0 < T < T_{c}. This analysis is shown in Fig. 5, in which _E_em, and _E_core are plotted vs _T/T_c. The most striking features of this analysis are the near-perfect linearity of _E_core over the entire temperature range, and the large value of _E_core, particularly at low T.

We do not claim to understand the origin of this behavior. We simply note that all of our data suggest an unconventional nature for the superconductivity of YBa2Cu3O6.95 and that little or nothing is known about the microscopic structure of vortices in such a system. The only relevant results of which we are aware are due to Volovik[24] who finds that the density of states at zero energy for a _d_-wave vortex is enhanced by a factor of k over that for an _s_-wave vortex. Clearly, further theoretical work on this subject is needed.

In conclusion we have measured the lower critical field _H_c1 of YBa2Cu3O6.95 using an ellipsoid-shaped crystal (thin-plate crystal for H perpendicular to the c axis) and found a linear temperature dependence of _H_c1 below 0.5_T_c. This is very different from that expected for conventional superconductivity but is consistent with that expected for a pairing state with line nodes in the gap. Combined with D_l_ab_(_T_) data[20] and values of D_l_ab_(_T_) infrared[23] and _mSR_ measurements,[22] our results suggest that the vortex core energy is proportional to 1 - T/T_{c} over the entire temperature range.

 The value and temperature dependence of the lower critical field _H__c_1 of high-_T_c superconductors have special importance in superconductivity theories. _H__c_1 is proportional to C1 (_H__c_1 = 4_p_d_1/Ph0), where C1 is the free energy per unit length of an isolated vortex and depends on the current distribution around the vortex, and hence on the penetration depth and on the core energy, i.e., the free-energy cost of the reduction of the order parameter in the core.1 In spite of numerous studies, the experimental results for _H__c_1 are still very confused. For YBa2Cu3O2-_x_, the reported low-temperature _H__c_1 values range from 400 to 8000 Oe and from 70 to 600 Oe for the field parallel and perpendicular to the c axis, respectively.2-9 The temperature dependence below 0.5_T_c is even more controversial: some results show a conventional saturation behavior6,8 while others show an unusual upturn at lower temperatures.3,5 A linear temperature dependence has also been reported.7

The lower critical field _H__c_1 marks the onset of the mixed state and has been conventionally determined by measuring the field at which the first Abrikosov vortex penetrates. However, due to the strong bulk pinning in high-_T_c superconductors, vortex lines penetrate into the sample very reluctantly and this makes the determination of _H__c_1 difficult. The problem is worse if the sample has an imperfect demagnetization geometry (i.e., nonellipsoidal shape), for then vortex penetration starts at sharp corners and edges at an even lower field than _H__c_1, and so broadens out the true _H__c_1 point. Nevertheless, until now determinations of _H__c_1 for YBa2Cu3O7-_x_ have been done on slab-shaped samples with sharp corners and edges. In addition, the Bean-Livingston (BL) surface barrier10 may push the first penetration field to a value much higher than _H__c_1.1 The combination of the surface barrier and the effects of sharp corners and edges very likely explains the large discrepancies among previous results.

In this paper, we report _H__c_1 data on an ellipsoid-shaped high-quality YBa2Cu3O6.95 single crystal, determined by magnetization _M_(_H_) measurements. The _M_(_H_) data were analyzed by the extended Bean critical-state models, both excluding and including the BL surface barrier. We show that the results are not affected by the surface barrier and are therefore a reliable measure of _H__c_1(_T_).

The ellipsoidal crystal, used for **H**\|c measurements, had a measured demagnetization factor n = 0.345 \pm 0.005 (the calculated n value was 0.347), whereas the thin plate used for **H**\|c had n \approx 0.026.

The crystals were first cooled in zero field to a chosen temperature, and then the magnetization M(H) was measured with increasing H using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. The shift from perfect shielding, \delta M(H), was then calculated by subtracting the straight-line fit to the low-field part of M(H) from the raw M(H) data. For all temperatures other than the lowest (10 K), the data are well described by the Bean critical-state model without surface barrier. In particular, for T \geq 20 K the data have almost no rounding near the first penetration field H_p, which can be determined simply by eye, without using extrapolation techniques commonly used in previous experiments.4-9 The 20-K data (**H**\|c) are shown in the inset to Fig. 2; H_p is increasingly better defined at higher T.

The 10-K data point requires closer scrutiny. According to the Bean critical-state model13 for type-II hard superconductors,7,14\delta M is essentially zero below H_e1 and

\[4\pi\delta M = A(H - H_e1)^2/H^*\;\;\;(H_e1 < H < H^*)\;,\]

where A is a constant related to the shape of the sample and H^* a parameter proportional to the critical current density J_c. For this work, the maximum field used was estimated to be less than one-tenth of H^*. However, a plot of (\delta M)^{1/2} vs H for **H**\|c at 10 K (Fig. 2) shows not a single straight line but a region of slow penetration followed by a more rapid increase with H. Similar behavior has been reported by Naito _et al._14 for (La_{1-x}Sr_{x})_{2}CuO_{4} samples and they explained the initially slow increase of \delta M as the vortex penetration into sharp corners and edges. Such edges and corners are not present in our case, and we believe that we are starting to see the effect of surface barriers (i.e., J_c is larger near the surface than inside). \delta M first increases slowly because of the existence of the surface barrier and then increases rapidly when the surface barrier is diminished by the applied field. Therefore, H_e1 is equal to or lower than H_p, the threshold of the lower straight line, rather than the higher threshold field obtained commonly by extrapolating down from higher fields.

The question is, if there exists a surface barrier, can we still take H_e1 as the first penetration field H_p or not? The BL surface barrier pushes H_p from H_e1 to H_e/\sqrt 2 for a perfect surface at 0 K,10 where H_e is the thermodynamic critical field. In conventional superconductors, experimental observation of The BL surface barrier requires highly polished surfaces because strong local fields caused by the surface roughness destroy the surface barrier and result in H_p = H_e1. However, in high-T_c superconductors, the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter \kappa is of order 100, and H_e is so much larger than H_e1 that local fields may not be strong enough to completely destroy the surface barrier, resulting in H_e/\sqrt 2 > H_p > H_e1. Burlachkov _et al._8 have included the BL surface barrier in the Bean critical-state model. They supposed that vortices start to penetrate into the sample at distinct points at the surface where the barrier is suppressed by defects such as surface roughness and twin boundaries, and obtained

\[\delta M = C[(1 - m)H_e1(H - H_e1)^2/2 + (H - H_e1)^3/6]\] (2) \[= C[(H - H_e1)^2[H - (3 m - 2)H_e1]\;/6\;,\]

where C is a constant related to the shape and critical current density of the sample and m is the ratio of equilibrium magnetization M over the maximum magnetization M(H_e1). They also estimated m \approx 0.7 for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - 8} (YBCO) (\kappa \approx 100). Putting m = 0.7 Eq. (2) yields

\[\delta M \approx C[(H - H_e1)^2H]/6\]

or

\[(\delta M/H)^{1/2} \propto H - H_e1\;.\]

This means that a plot of (\delta M/H)^{1/2} vs H gives a straight line with a threshold at H_e1. Even in the case where the surface barrier is not completely destroyed but rather just diminished at distinct surface defects so that vortex penetration starts at H_p > H_e1, Eq. (2) [and so Eq. (4)] still holds in the region somewhat above H_p because the surface barrier diminishes quickly after the first vortex entry. Therefore, H_e1 can always be obtained by extrapolation of the linear part of the curve to (\delta M/H)^{1/2} = 0. In Fig. 3 we have replotted the 10-K data shown in Fig. 2 in the form of (\delta M/H)^{1/2}. As is seen, (\delta M/H)^{1/2} is roughly linear with H above H_p, and

Figure 2: Plots of (4\pi\delta M)^{1/2} vs H for the ellipsoidal crystal with **H**\|c at 10 K and 20 K (inset). At 10 K, above the first penetration field H_p, (4\pi\delta M)^{1/2} first increases slowly and then more sharply. The initial slow increase is attributed to the existence of a surface barrier. At 20 K, (4\pi\delta M)^{1/2} is almost linear in H above H_p, consistent with the prediction of the Bean critical-state model without the surface barrier.

  the linear fit gives H_{c1}\!\approx\!H_{p}. This confirms that, in our case, H_{p}\!=\!H_{c1} and the surface barrier does not push H_{p} higher than H_{c1} but only lowers the rate of vortex entry. Surface roughness of submicrometer order seems to be very effective in destroying the surface barrier. At higher temperature, the surface barrier is further diminished by thermal activation.

The results are summarized in Fig. 4, where we show the temperature dependence of H_{c1} for both {\bf H}\|c and H\bot c. At temperatures below \sim\!0.5T_{c}, we see neither conventional saturation nor upturn, but essentially a linear temperature dependence with slopes of 10 and 1.9 Oe/K for {\bf H}\|c and {\bf H}\bot c, respectively. This is qualitatively different from the saturation at low temperatures expected for a conventional _s_-wave BCS superconductor [15] and is consistent with an energy gap with line nodes, [16] as predicted by models that lead to _d_-wave superconductivity. [17] It is worth mentioning that, although the model of quasi-two-dimensional superconducting sheets alternating with normal layers [18] can also explain the lack of the saturation in H_{c1} at low temperatures, it produces a temperature dependent \gamma\!=\!H_{c1}^{1}/H_{c1}^{1} that is inconsistent with our observations in YBa_{\rm c}Cu_{3}O_{6.95}. The anisotropy factor \gamma that we observed is almost temperature independent and has the value 5.6\!\pm\!0.3, consistent with the values 5\!-\!6 estimated for H_{c2} measurements. [19] This is larger than the values 3\!-\!4 in previous H_{c1} measurements [4, 5, 6, 7] made on slab-shaped samples with the shortest dimensions along the c axis. Sharp corners and edges in the slab geometry likely lead to underestimation of H_{c1}^{1} and \gamma. We emphasize that the temperature independence of \gamma is a strong corroborating evidence that we have measured the true H_{c1} rather than a surface-condition-dependent first entry field, because, first, the surface barriers in the two directions are highly unlikely to be the same, and secondly, the ellipsoid and the thin plate crystal have completely different surface roughnesses.

The experimental value for H_{c1} is surprisingly large compared to what one might expect from Ginzburg-Landau theory. In general, the vortex line energy, {\cal E}_{1}\!=\!\Phi_{0}H_{c1}/(4\pi) is a sum of two parts, [1]

\[{\cal E}_{1}\!=\!E_{\rm em}\!+\!E_{\rm core}\ ,\] (5)

where, for a large-\kappa material,

Figure 4: Lower critical field H_{c1} of YBa_{\rm c}Cu_{3}O_{6.95} for both {\bf H}\|c and {\bf H}\bot c. The H_{c1}’s are linear with temperature below 0.5T_{c}, with slopes of 10.0\pm0.3 and 1.9\pm0.1 Oe/K for {\bf H}\|c and {\bf H}\bot c, respectively. Extrapolation of the data to zero temperature yields H_{c1}^{1}(0)\!=\!1100\!\pm\!50 Oe and H_{c1}^{1}(0)\!=\!200\!\pm\!20 Oe. The inset shows the data near T_{c} in detail.

Figure 3: Plot of (4\pi\delta M/H)^{1/2} vs H replotted from the 10-K data shown in Fig. 2. Above the first penetration field H_{p}, the data are roughly linear with H and the linear fit gives threshold H_{c1}\!=\!H_{p}. This confirms that the surface barrier does not increase H_{p} beyond H_{c1}.

  \[E_{\rm em}=\left[\frac{\Phi_{0}}{4\pi\lambda}\right]^{2}{\rm ln}\kappa\] (6)

is the energy of the magnetic field and of the supercurrent associated with the vortex. In GL theory for an _s_-wave superconductor,[21] the effect of the core energy is to add a term of order 0.5 to lna, which is negligible if k is large, as it is for YBCO (_k_  70). Assigning all of the vortex energy to _E_em and using H_{c1}^{\dagger}(0) = 1100 Oe implies \lambda_{ab}(0) \approx 800 A, in serious disagreement with the value of 1400 A by _mSR_ and infrared measurements.[22, 23] This comparison suggests that the core energy of an isolated vortex in YBa2Cu3O6.95 is substantially larger than one would expect for a conventional superconductor. In fact, using the value of \lambda_{ab}(0) \approx 1400 A from muon spin resonance (_mSR_)[22] and infrared[23] measurements and D_l_ab_(_T_) from microwave measurement[20] allows us to determine _E_em and hence to extract the core energy _E_core, over the entire temperature range 0 < T < T_{c}. This analysis is shown in Fig. 5, in which _E_em, and _E_core are plotted vs _T/T_c. The most striking features of this analysis are the near-perfect linearity of _E_core over the entire temperature range, and the large value of _E_core, particularly at low T.

We do not claim to understand the origin of this behavior. We simply note that all of our data suggest an unconventional nature for the superconductivity of YBa2Cu3O6.95 and that little or nothing is known about the microscopic structure of vortices in such a system. The only relevant results of which we are aware are due to Volovik[24] who finds that the density of states at zero energy for a _d_-wave vortex is enhanced by a factor of k over that for an _s_-wave vortex. Clearly, further theoretical work on this subject is needed.

In conclusion we have measured the lower critical field _H_c1 of YBa2Cu3O6.95 using an ellipsoid-shaped crystal (thin-plate crystal for H perpendicular to the c axis) and found a linear temperature dependence of _H_c1 below 0.5_T_c. This is very different from that expected for conventional superconductivity but is consistent with that expected for a pairing state with line nodes in the gap. Combined with D_l_ab_(_T_) data[20] and values of D_l_ab_(_T_) infrared[23] and _mSR_ measurements,[22] our results suggest that the vortex core energy is proportional to 1 - T/T_{c} over the entire temperature range.
