###### Abstract

We have investigated the synthesis, structure, and electronic properties of (NH3)_x_K3C60 by exposing preformed K3C60 to NH3 vapor. Measurements were made on bulk powders and films with a variety of techniques including _in-situ_ x-ray diffraction and monitoring of NH3 pressure, Raman scattering and ac susceptibility. The reaction of NH3 with K3C60 is completely reversible and leaves the (C60)3- charge state intact, while allowing the distance between the C60 molecules to vary. We observe two different crystallographic structures at x = 1 and x = 8-10. The x = 1 structure is face-centered orthorhombic with a single NH3 on the octahedral interstitial site. It is single phase at 100 degC and NH3 pressures >= 400 torr and remains single phase at 0 torr if the temperature is reduced to 25 degC. Although (NH3)K3C60 exhibits no superconductivity at ambient pressure, superconductivity can be induced by hydrostatic pressure with an onset at 28 K. The details of the x = 8-10 structure are uncertain, however it appears that this phase is body-centered tetragonal with NH3 on both the octahedral and tetrahedral sites. It occurs at room temperature and NH3 pressures >= 500 torr, but is not stable at lower NH3 pressures. Resistivity measurements of NH3-doped K3C60 films show that the formation of the new structure results in a rapid increase of the resistivity to values exceeding 1 O cm.

## 1 Introduction

Since the report of superconductivity in K3C60,1 the crystal structures and the electronic properties of the superconducting alkali-metal fullerides have been studied in detail.2 The transition temperature T_{c} of superconducting A3C60 compounds scales with the size of the unit cell,3,4 with no evidence of T_{c} saturation at the larger unit cells.

Synthesis of A3C60 with still larger unit cells is desirable to determine if higher _T__c_'s can be obtained and to investigate the eventual metal-insulator transition, which is expected to occur as the conduction bandwidth becomes smaller than the on-site Coulomb repulsion. However, structural expansion using alkali metals alone in the interstitial sites is limited by the size of the metal ions available for intercalation.5 Recently, we demonstrated that additional structural expansion can be obtained by using alkali atoms for charge transfer with neutral molecules, such as ammonia, as structural "spacers."6,7 The expanded compounds were synthesized by exposing preformed A3C60 to NH3 gas followed by a gentle anneal and subsequent measurement in sealed, He-filled ampules. Our results indicate that in at least one case the fcc lattice can be expanded without disturbing the fcc symmetry or charge transfer. In this example, exposing Na2C8C60 to 380 torr of NH3, results in an expansion of the fcc lattice parameter from a = 14.13 to 14.47 A, and a near tripling of T_{c} from 10.5-29.7 K.6 The enhanced T_{c} of the resulting (NH3)4Na2C8C60 agrees with the expected value from the T_{c} vs a correlation,3 however, this is not a universal feature of ammoniation of A3C60 superconductors. Ammoniation of K3C60 under similar conditions yields NH3K3C60. Despite evidence of full charge transfer and a (C60)3- oxidation state, the ammonia induces a symmetry reduction from fcc to face-centered orthorhombic and a nonsuperconducting compound above 4 K.7

In this paper we further explore the ammoniation of K3C60 by varying both the measurement conditions, e.g., temperature or pressure, as well as the reaction conditions such as synthesis temperature and NH3 pressure. We report _in-situ_ measurements under NH3 pressure as well as measurements under zero NH3 vapor pressure. We find that a diversity of structures and physical properties can be obtained by ammoniation of K3C60. First, we report that NH3K3C60 prepared as in our earlier report7 is superconducting only when applying hydrostatic pressure up to 14 kbar. This situation is similar to Cs3C60, where superconductivity was only observed under hydrostatic pressure.8 NH3K3C60 remains face-centered orthorhombic under pressure with no observable pressure or temperature-induced structural changes. Second, using resistivity measurements of K3C60 films and _in-situ_ x-ray diffraction of K3C60 exposed to NH3, we show that an additional phase with a higher ammonia stoichiometry can be formed at NH3 pressures in excess of 500 torr. Comparison of x-ray data with structural models indicates that the higher NH3 pressure material may have NH3 around both alkali-atom sites, in contrast to the other ammoniated fullerides, which only contain NH3 on the octahedral sites.

Unlike NH3-K-graphite ternaries,9 ammoniation of K3C60 is completely reversible. No potassium amide or H2 formation was observed indicating that ammoniation does not affect the C60 valence state. Deintercalation of (NH3)_x_K3C60 to NH3K3C60 occurs when the NH3 pressure is kept below 500 torr at room temperature. Further deintercalation to fcc K3C60 can be achieved by raising the temperature above room temperature at low NH3 pressure.

## II Experimental Procedures

Controlled ammoniation of K3C60 films and powder was carried out on a stainless-steel vacuum line with absolute pressure gauges (MKS Instruments) covering 0-5000 torr. Before use, the NH3 was dried by condensing it into sodium metal in a glass flask held at dry-ice temperature. Subsequently, the NH3 vapor pressure was controlled by varying the temperature of the Na-NH3 solution. The volume of each section of the vacuum line was calibrated such that the amount of ammonia uptake could be calculated from the change in NH3 pressure. The NH3 pressure could be reduced to zero by cooling a separate trap to liquid-nitrogen temperature. Observation of the residual pressure after condensing the NH3 gave a measure of any noncondensible, gas, e.g., H2 or N2, present in the gas volume. No residual gas pressure was observed during the course of the experiments described here.

_In-situ_ x-ray-diffraction studies of the effects of NH3 on K3C60 powder were performed by loading K3C60 powder into a 5-mm-diam Pyrex tube with one end drawn into a thin-walled capillary. The glass tube was connected to a high vacuum stopcock by a Cajon Ultra-Torr fitting in a helium-filled dry box and attached to the same vacuum line described above. A Cu K_{a} rotating-anode x-ray source with a singly bent graphite monochromator and flat graphite analyzer was used for structural measurements. The x-ray powder pattern of NH3K3C60 was obtained at 10-300 K using powder sealed in a glass capillary under a helium atmosphere using a closed-cycle refrigerator.

A Dildor _XY_ Raman spectrometer with 5154-A-incident Ar+-ion laser and liquid-nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) detector was used to measure the pressure-induced frequency shifts of the ruby R1 and R2 lines for pressure calibration, and also to measure the C60A_g_ mode under pressure. The data were collected in back-scattering geometry with 1 mW of laser light focused to approximately a 16-_m_m spot. The instrumental resolution was typically about 3 cm-1.

High-pressure powder x-ray-diffraction and Raman measurements were made in a Merrill-Bassett-type diamond-anvil cell with predried mineral oil as the pressure medium. A 200-_m_m_-diam hole was drilled in a spring-steel gasket and filled with NH3K3C60 powder and a ruby chip (Cr3+-doped Al2O3). The pressure cell was loaded in a He-filled glove box and was sealed by applying a small pressure before removing it from the glove box. X-ray-diffraction measurements on the diamond-anvil cell were carried out on a Mo K_{a} rotating-anode x-ray diffractometer equipped with a flat graphite monochromator and analyzer. The NH3K3C60 used in the pressure studies had a minority second phase of unreacted K3C60. The coherence length of the ammoniated phase, as determined from the x-ray peak widths, was about 300 A, as compared to 350 A for the K3C60. The minority K3C60 phase was useful as an additional pressure standard in the susceptibility measurement.

The glass apparatus used earlier10 for the four-point electrical resistivity measurement of A_x_C60 films was modified by adding a magnetically operated break seal so that NH3 gas could be introduced to the system without exposing the film to air. In addition to a C60 film, the glass chamber contained a potassium effusion cell and an electrically controlled getter pump. The granular K3C60 film, prepared prior to exposure to NH3, had a thickness of 2150 A and a room-temperature resistivity of 2.3 mO cm. After attaching the glass chamber to the vacuum line and opening the break seal, the NH3 pressure was increased step wise. The film resistance was allowed to stabilize before recording the value and increasing the pressure again.

ac susceptibility of the NH3K3C60 powder was measured between 0.1 and 14.8 kbar using a clamp-type cell11 with the mineral oil as pressure medium. The cell contained a primary coil outside the pressure cell that generated an ac magnetic field of 0.1 Oe at 88 Hz and two counter-wound secondary coils inside the cell. About 5 mg of sample sealed in an evacuated Pyrex capillary was inserted in the pick-up coils inside a Teflon cup filled with dried mineral oil. A Pb chip inside a second unbalanced pick-up coil was used for pressure calibration. The Pyrex capillary was crushed at seal pressure and the pressure was then transmitted to the sample by the mineral oil.

## III Results

### Phase formation and crystallographic structure

In earlier experiments7 single-phase NH3K3C60 was prepared by heating K3C60 in 450 torr of NH3 at 100 degC followed by cooling to room temperature and evacuating the remaining gaseous NH3. Here, we use _in-situ_ x-ray diffraction of NH3-K3C60 to investigate the conditions for obtaining single-phase material. We find that after annealing at 100 degC for about an hour at NH3 pressures of 200 torr,12 NH3K3C60 initially appears at room temperature as a second phase with K3C60. NH3K3C60, estimated from the x-ray intensity ratios, grows at the expense of K3C60 as the NH3 pressure is increased. At pressures between 400 and 1000 torr, NH3K3C60 is single phase at 100 degC. Once formed, NH3K3C60 remains even at 0 torr if the temperature is reduced to 25 degC. At temperatures higher than 200 degC and NH3 pressure < 1000 torr, NH3 is evolved and the structure reverts the K3C60. All the gas evolved from NH3K3C60 on heating is condensible at LN2 temperature showing that no H2 is formed at any stage of the intercalation or deintercalation. The amount of NH3 condensed, determined by measuring the pressure after expanding into a known volume, was found to be 0.95+-0.05 NH3/C60. The x-ray-diffraction pattern taken after deammonium shows single-phase fcc K3C60. The fitted lattice parameters at 400 torr NH3 pressure are 14.97+-14.89+-13.65 A, the same as those measured  after removing the NH3 pressure.7 The unit-cell volume of 761 A 3/C60 is 5% larger than that of the fcc K3C60. In the ammoniated compound, each octahedral K is coordinated with one NH3 and displaced away from the center of the octahedral site, which induces a structural distortion from cubic to orthorhombic. No NH3 is associated with the potassium atom on the tetrahedral site.

Further NH3 uptake and a structural transformation were observed when the NH3 pressure was raised above 500 torr, as shown in the lower x-ray pattern of Fig. 1(a). This pattern was obtained at room temperature with NH3 pressures in the range 500-1000 torr. The intensities of the peaks at 19.6 and 20.69deg 2_th_ (marked with arrows) were found to decrease with increasing NH3 pressure at room temperature, while the relative intensities and d spacings of the other reflections remained the same. This behavior indicates that the system is multiphase under these conditions and contains a new phase together with one or more additional phases.13 At a fixed pressure, no significant change in the x-ray powder pattern was observed over 24 h. Heating the sample to 110 degC at a fixed NH3 pressure of 500 torr, shown in Fig. 1(a) produced a release of NH3 and the formation of predominately NH3K3C60. Further heating the sample to 200 degC at 500 torr results in complete NH3 deintercalation and fcc K3C60.

_In-situ_ annealing for 2 h at pressures up to 1000 torr did not result in single-phase material of the new, higher NH3 pressure phase. We were successful, however, in obtaining a pattern that could be indexed as single phase by annealing for 10 h in a tube _sealed_ at 1000 torr NH3. (Unlike the _in-situ_ experiments, this is not a fixed-pressure measurement, since reaction of NH3 with K3C60 will reduce the pressure of NH3 in the tube.) After 10 h at 100 degC, the x-ray pattern evolved from one similar to the lower curve of Fig. 1(a) to the data shown in Fig. 1(b), where the diffuse background due to the glass capillary has been subtracted. Figure 1(b) can be indexed as a single phase with a number of different unit cells: two body-centered tetragonal cells with lattice parameters of 13.58 x 15.7, 13.51 x 9.64, or 12.15 x 15.7 A, as well as an orthorhombic cell of 13.28 x 11.09 x 9.68 A. Two of these cells have _c_-axis parameters are smaller than the C60 van der Waals diameter [if one excludes K-C60 bonding as proposed for RbC60 (Ref. [14])], while the 13.58 x 15.7 bct cell gives an unreasonably large unit-cell volume per fullerene molecule. The 12.15 x 15.7 A bct cell was therefore chosen as the most likely candidate. Intensity calculations were carried out using the LAZYPULVERIX (Ref. [15]) program using a spherical shell of charge to model the C60 molecule and Ne atoms (10 electrons each) to model ammonia molecules. In a separate experiment, monitoring the pressure change during NH3 uptake, the NH3 stoichiometry was calculated to be 10 +- - (C60. Using _14_/_mmm_ symmetry, a number of different orientations of NH3 consistent with this approximate stoichiometry were attempted. Approximate agreement of a model with the data were obtained using the model shown in Fig. 2(a). For comparison, a schematic drawing of the model of NH3K3C60 used in Ref. [7] is also shown in Fig. 2(b). In Fig. 2(a), ammonia molecules are located at sites (8_j_) (_x_, 1/2,0) and at (8_g_) (0, 1/2, 2) giving a composition of (NH3)8K3C60. A simulated x-ray powder pattern using the structural model is shown in Fig. 1(b) along with the data (with the diffuse background from the glass capillary subtracted). Fixing the all potassium-ammonia distances at 2.7 A, the same as in NH3K3C60 (Ref. [7]) gives x = 0.28 and z = 0.42. This model gives a rather short ammonia-ammonia distance across the (0,1.2,0) site of 2.5 A, however, the quality of the data requires that this model be taken as preliminary. All the model calculations do strongly suggest, however, that a structure with NH3 in both the octahedral and the tetrahedral sites is required.

### Electronic properties at low pressure

In our previous paper7 we reported that NH3K3C60 is noncubic and nonsuperconducting. Here, we first address the electronic properties of (NH3)xK3C60 at low NH3 pressure and correlate the results with the structural results reported above. As shown in Fig. 3, the room

The arrows indicate peaks from one or more additional phases. (b) A powder x-ray-diffraction pattern of (NH3)8K3C60 sealed at room temperature and 1000 torr of NH3 taken after annealing at 100 °C for 10 h. The lower curve is a simulated diffraction pattern calculated from a preliminary model structure for (NH3)8K3C60.

  temperature resistivity (\rho) of K3C60 films increases slowly with increasing NH3 pressure, from 2.3 mO cm at 0 torr to about 10 mO cm at 400 torr. The resistivity increases rapidly above 500 torr to 2200 mO cm at 840 torr. Upon reducing the pressure at room temperature, the resistivity exhibits a large hysteresis and stabilizes at 30 mO cm at 0 torr, about ten times higher than the value before NH3 exposure. Heating at 150 degC under dynamic vacuum for a few hours recovers the original resistivity of the K3C60 film, consistent with complete loss of ammonia. Resistivity measurements at 100 degC give a different result. At 100 degC, \rho increases continuously with increasing pressure up to 1000 torr, the highest pressure of the experiment. The rapid resistivity increase observed at 25 degC and 500 torr is absent. Lowering the temperature to room temperature at a fixed pressure above 500 torr results in an increase of \rho.

The above transport data can be rationalized on the basis of the phase formed in bulk samples under comparable conditions. On exposure to NH3 at conditions known to produce single phase NH3K3C60 (100 degC at 500 torr), the resistance of the metallic K3C60 film increases by a factor of 5-10. An insulating state is obtained _only_ under conditions that have been shown to produce a sample that is predominately the high NH3 pressure structure (25 degC at \geq 500 torr). The increase in the resistance as the film was cooled from 100 degC to room temperature at constant pressure is likely the result of the slow conversion of the film to the high pressure phase. One concludes from these data that the high NH3 pressure structure is insulating, however, our data do not exclude the possibility that NH3K3C60 could be metallic. A definitive test of the metallic character of NH3K3C60 is difficult, however, since all samples have some contamination with metallic K3C60.

### Electronic properties at hydrostatic pressure

The lack of superconductivity in NH3K3C60 despite chemical evidence of a half-filled band is surprising.7 Possible reasons for this fact could be either the occurrence of a Mott transition brought about by the increased in the intermolecular distances in the expanded unit cell or by suppression of the superconductivity due to granularity of the material. Either of these effects could be negated by the application of hydrostatic pressure. Our measurements show that, indeed, NH3K3C60 is superconducting under hydrostatic pressures. No observable change in the orthorhombic face-centered structure occurs in x-ray measurements at similar pressures. The temperature dependence of the ac susceptibility of NH3K3C60 measured between 0.1 and 14.8 kbar is shown in Fig. 4. At 1 bar, the data show a flat background and two small but sharp transitions at 19 and 7.2 K, from the minority K3C60 phase (as determined by x-ray diffraction)

The ammonia atom ordering shown (small circles) gives a stoichiometry of (NH3)_{x}K_{y}C60 and the calculated diffraction pattern shown in Fig. 1(b). (b) A schematic diagram of the structure of NH3K3C60 described in detail in Ref. 7. The unit cell has been rotated by 45° about the c axis to allow viewing of the octahedral and tetrahedral sites.

The position of K and NH3 within each octahedral site is random among four equivalent sites.

  and the Pb chip, respectively. Upon applying pressure, a broad transition appears at a higher temperature. The shielding fraction and the apparent onset temperature of this transition increase with increasing pressure, to 5% and 28 K at 14.8 kbar, respectively. At low pressure, the exact T_{c} is difficult to determine because of the low shielding fraction and the breadth of the transition. The signal is completely reversible upon pressure cycling. The superconducting transition temperature of the small amount of K3C60 in the sample decreases with increasing pressure with a slope of -0.62 K/kbar in agreement with previous measurements [16, 17].

Room-temperature powder diffraction patterns collected at 0.6 and 8 kbar are shown in Fig. 5, along with a calculated 1-bar pattern obtained using the 1-bar NH3K3C60 orthorhombic cell parameters [7] and Lazy-PULVERIX. [15] There is no observable change in the symmetry of the structure with pressure. Both patterns are consistent with the orthorhombic structure at 1 bar and neither can be indexed as cubic. The 8-kbar powder pattern is very similar to that obtained at 0.6 kbar, except the peaks are shifted to higher 2_th_'s and the intensities of the (202) and (022) peaks have increased. Due to the small number of broad, overlapping peaks, reliable unit cell parameters under pressure cannot be obtained from the present data. The Bragg peaks in Fig. 5 are broad because of the small particle size, rather than instrumental resolution. The widths are pressure independent over the pressure range studied. Approximate lattice parameters of a fit of the limited number of observed peaks to a _tetragonal_ cell give a=14.7 A and c=13.7 A at 8 kbar, a contraction from 1 bar of \Delta V/V\approx 3\%. A separate x-ray measurement using Cu \mathbf{K}_{\alpha} radiation shows that the room-temperature face-centered orthorhombic structure of NH3K3C60 is sustained at temperatures as low as 10 K.

Raman spectra measured at 1 bar from a sample sealed in a glass capillary, and at 0.6 kbar and 16 kbar from the powder in the diamond-anvil cell are shown in Fig. 6. At atmospheric pressure, the sample has a simple sharp A_{g} mode centered at 1448.5 cm-1, nearly the same as that reported for K3C60[18], indicating that C60 in the

  NH3K3C60 phase is in the 3-oxidation state. This result confirms our previous conclusion that ammoniation does not affect the charge transfer from alkali metal to C60. Under pressure the _A_g mode is upshifted, to 1454 cm-1 at 16 kbar. As in the case of pristine C60,19 the _A_g mode is broad and asymmetric at high pressure. The shift in the frequency of the _A_g mode is due to pressure-induced stiffening rather than phase separation or change in the C60 valence state. Assuming that the frequency of the _A_g mode shifts linearly with the applied pressure, as in the case for all the vibrational modes of pristine C60, one obtains a positive pressure slope of 0.31 cm-1/kbar, larger than the 0.17 cm-1/kbar slope reported for pristine C60.19 The results from both x-ray diffraction and Raman measurements therefore indicate that at room temperature there is no phase separation or structural transition under pressure. We do not expect the results to be different at low temperature and high pressure, as excess pressure compensates the temperature term in the free energy.

## IV Conclusions

Resistivity measurements of K3C60 films in gaseous NH3 and _in-situ_ x-ray measurements of K3C60 powder under NH3 have revealed new details about the NH3-K3C60 phase diagram. NH3K3C60 initially appears as a second phase at room temperature and 200 torr. The fraction of NH3K3C60 increases to 100% at 400 torr and 100 degC. Once formed, NH3K3C60 remains at room temperature and 0 torr. (The slow kinetics associated with NH3 intercalation and deintercalation makes the precise determination of the equilibrium NH3-K3C60 phase diagram difficult.) At room temperature and NH3 pressures 500-1000 torr, a new phase with 8-10 NH3 molecules per K3C60 formula unit becomes the dominant phase. This structure appears to become single phase after heating K3C60 sealed with 1000 torr NH3 to 100 degC. The data were not clean enough to refine a structural model, however, preliminary results indicate that the new structure contains NH3 on both the octahedral and tetrahedral interstitial sites, in contrast to NH3K3C60 and (NH3)4Na2CsC60. At room temperature, the high NH3 pressure phase appears to be electrically insulating.

The results reported in this paper show that in NH3K3C60 the charge transfer is unchanged from that of K3C60 and that the orthorhombic structure is stable at low temperature. This raises the question as to why ammoniation causes the loss of superconductivity in NH3K3C60 and why hydrostatic pressure recovers the superconductivity. We suggest as a possible reason the vicinity of the Mott limit. The Mott limit has been estimated to be near 2 mG cm for these materials,20 which is close to the measured resistivity of K3C60 thin films. After taking up one NH3 per C60 to form NH3K3C60, the resistivity increases by a factor of 5 to about 10 mG cm at room temperature. We note that, although the unit-cell volume of NH3K3C60 is comparable to that of the metallic Rb2CsC60, the intermolecular distances are anisotropic. In an {_hk_0} plane, the nearest-neighbor center-to-center intermolecular distance is 10.56 A, substantially larger than the value of 10.25 A in Rb2CsC60. We suggest that the additional expansion in {_hk_0} planes in NH3K3C60 could result in electron localization and induces a metal-insulator transition. As hydrostatic pressure causes primarily volume reduction in the a and b axes, this could consequently delocalize the t1_  * [12] Slow kinetics was evident in these experiments. In most cases, heating and cooling cycles from 25-100 degC aided phase formation. Phase formation occurred on the time scale of a few hours.

###### Abstract

We have investigated the synthesis, structure, and electronic properties of (NH3)_x_K3C60 by exposing preformed K3C60 to NH3 vapor. Measurements were made on bulk powders and films with a variety of techniques including _in-situ_ x-ray diffraction and monitoring of NH3 pressure, Raman scattering and ac susceptibility. The reaction of NH3 with K3C60 is completely reversible and leaves the (C60)3- charge state intact, while allowing the distance between the C60 molecules to vary. We observe two different crystallographic structures at x = 1 and x = 8-10. The x = 1 structure is face-centered orthorhombic with a single NH3 on the octahedral interstitial site. It is single phase at 100 degC and NH3 pressures >= 400 torr and remains single phase at 0 torr if the temperature is reduced to 25 degC. Although (NH3)K3C60 exhibits no superconductivity at ambient pressure, superconductivity can be induced by hydrostatic pressure with an onset at 28 K. The details of the x = 8-10 structure are uncertain, however it appears that this phase is body-centered tetragonal with NH3 on both the octahedral and tetrahedral sites. It occurs at room temperature and NH3 pressures >= 500 torr, but is not stable at lower NH3 pressures. Resistivity measurements of NH3-doped K3C60 films show that the formation of the new structure results in a rapid increase of the resistivity to values exceeding 1 O cm.

## 1 Introduction

Since the report of superconductivity in K3C60,1 the crystal structures and the electronic properties of the superconducting alkali-metal fullerides have been studied in detail.2 The transition temperature T_{c} of superconducting A3C60 compounds scales with the size of the unit cell,3,4 with no evidence of T_{c} saturation at the larger unit cells.

Synthesis of A3C60 with still larger unit cells is desirable to determine if higher _T__c_'s can be obtained and to investigate the eventual metal-insulator transition, which is expected to occur as the conduction bandwidth becomes smaller than the on-site Coulomb repulsion. However, structural expansion using alkali metals alone in the interstitial sites is limited by the size of the metal ions available for intercalation.5 Recently, we demonstrated that additional structural expansion can be obtained by using alkali atoms for charge transfer with neutral molecules, such as ammonia, as structural "spacers."6,7 The expanded compounds were synthesized by exposing preformed A3C60 to NH3 gas followed by a gentle anneal and subsequent measurement in sealed, He-filled ampules. Our results indicate that in at least one case the fcc lattice can be expanded without disturbing the fcc symmetry or charge transfer. In this example, exposing Na2C8C60 to 380 torr of NH3, results in an expansion of the fcc lattice parameter from a = 14.13 to 14.47 A, and a near tripling of T_{c} from 10.5-29.7 K.6 The enhanced T_{c} of the resulting (NH3)4Na2C8C60 agrees with the expected value from the T_{c} vs a correlation,3 however, this is not a universal feature of ammoniation of A3C60 superconductors. Ammoniation of K3C60 under similar conditions yields NH3K3C60. Despite evidence of full charge transfer and a (C60)3- oxidation state, the ammonia induces a symmetry reduction from fcc to face-centered orthorhombic and a nonsuperconducting compound above 4 K.7

In this paper we further explore the ammoniation of K3C60 by varying both the measurement conditions, e.g., temperature or pressure, as well as the reaction conditions such as synthesis temperature and NH3 pressure. We report _in-situ_ measurements under NH3 pressure as well as measurements under zero NH3 vapor pressure. We find that a diversity of structures and physical properties can be obtained by ammoniation of K3C60. First, we report that NH3K3C60 prepared as in our earlier report7 is superconducting only when applying hydrostatic pressure up to 14 kbar. This situation is similar to Cs3C60, where superconductivity was only observed under hydrostatic pressure.8 NH3K3C60 remains face-centered orthorhombic under pressure with no observable pressure or temperature-induced structural changes. Second, using resistivity measurements of K3C60 films and _in-situ_ x-ray diffraction of K3C60 exposed to NH3, we show that an additional phase with a higher ammonia stoichiometry can be formed at NH3 pressures in excess of 500 torr. Comparison of x-ray data with structural models indicates that the higher NH3 pressure material may have NH3 around both alkali-atom sites, in contrast to the other ammoniated fullerides, which only contain NH3 on the octahedral sites.

Unlike NH3-K-graphite ternaries,9 ammoniation of K3C60 is completely reversible. No potassium amide or H2 formation was observed indicating that ammoniation does not affect the C60 valence state. Deintercalation of (NH3)_x_K3C60 to NH3K3C60 occurs when the NH3 pressure is kept below 500 torr at room temperature. Further deintercalation to fcc K3C60 can be achieved by raising the temperature above room temperature at low NH3 pressure.

## II Experimental Procedures

Controlled ammoniation of K3C60 films and powder was carried out on a stainless-steel vacuum line with absolute pressure gauges (MKS Instruments) covering 0-5000 torr. Before use, the NH3 was dried by condensing it into sodium metal in a glass flask held at dry-ice temperature. Subsequently, the NH3 vapor pressure was controlled by varying the temperature of the Na-NH3 solution. The volume of each section of the vacuum line was calibrated such that the amount of ammonia uptake could be calculated from the change in NH3 pressure. The NH3 pressure could be reduced to zero by cooling a separate trap to liquid-nitrogen temperature. Observation of the residual pressure after condensing the NH3 gave a measure of any noncondensible, gas, e.g., H2 or N2, present in the gas volume. No residual gas pressure was observed during the course of the experiments described here.

_In-situ_ x-ray-diffraction studies of the effects of NH3 on K3C60 powder were performed by loading K3C60 powder into a 5-mm-diam Pyrex tube with one end drawn into a thin-walled capillary. The glass tube was connected to a high vacuum stopcock by a Cajon Ultra-Torr fitting in a helium-filled dry box and attached to the same vacuum line described above. A Cu K_{a} rotating-anode x-ray source with a singly bent graphite monochromator and flat graphite analyzer was used for structural measurements. The x-ray powder pattern of NH3K3C60 was obtained at 10-300 K using powder sealed in a glass capillary under a helium atmosphere using a closed-cycle refrigerator.

A Dildor _XY_ Raman spectrometer with 5154-A-incident Ar+-ion laser and liquid-nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) detector was used to measure the pressure-induced frequency shifts of the ruby R1 and R2 lines for pressure calibration, and also to measure the C60A_g_ mode under pressure. The data were collected in back-scattering geometry with 1 mW of laser light focused to approximately a 16-_m_m spot. The instrumental resolution was typically about 3 cm-1.

High-pressure powder x-ray-diffraction and Raman measurements were made in a Merrill-Bassett-type diamond-anvil cell with predried mineral oil as the pressure medium. A 200-_m_m_-diam hole was drilled in a spring-steel gasket and filled with NH3K3C60 powder and a ruby chip (Cr3+-doped Al2O3). The pressure cell was loaded in a He-filled glove box and was sealed by applying a small pressure before removing it from the glove box. X-ray-diffraction measurements on the diamond-anvil cell were carried out on a Mo K_{a} rotating-anode x-ray diffractometer equipped with a flat graphite monochromator and analyzer. The NH3K3C60 used in the pressure studies had a minority second phase of unreacted K3C60. The coherence length of the ammoniated phase, as determined from the x-ray peak widths, was about 300 A, as compared to 350 A for the K3C60. The minority K3C60 phase was useful as an additional pressure standard in the susceptibility measurement.

The glass apparatus used earlier10 for the four-point electrical resistivity measurement of A_x_C60 films was modified by adding a magnetically operated break seal so that NH3 gas could be introduced to the system without exposing the film to air. In addition to a C60 film, the glass chamber contained a potassium effusion cell and an electrically controlled getter pump. The granular K3C60 film, prepared prior to exposure to NH3, had a thickness of 2150 A and a room-temperature resistivity of 2.3 mO cm. After attaching the glass chamber to the vacuum line and opening the break seal, the NH3 pressure was increased step wise. The film resistance was allowed to stabilize before recording the value and increasing the pressure again.

ac susceptibility of the NH3K3C60 powder was measured between 0.1 and 14.8 kbar using a clamp-type cell11 with the mineral oil as pressure medium. The cell contained a primary coil outside the pressure cell that generated an ac magnetic field of 0.1 Oe at 88 Hz and two counter-wound secondary coils inside the cell. About 5 mg of sample sealed in an evacuated Pyrex capillary was inserted in the pick-up coils inside a Teflon cup filled with dried mineral oil. A Pb chip inside a second unbalanced pick-up coil was used for pressure calibration. The Pyrex capillary was crushed at seal pressure and the pressure was then transmitted to the sample by the mineral oil.

## III Results

### Phase formation and crystallographic structure

In earlier experiments7 single-phase NH3K3C60 was prepared by heating K3C60 in 450 torr of NH3 at 100 degC followed by cooling to room temperature and evacuating the remaining gaseous NH3. Here, we use _in-situ_ x-ray diffraction of NH3-K3C60 to investigate the conditions for obtaining single-phase material. We find that after annealing at 100 degC for about an hour at NH3 pressures of 200 torr,12 NH3K3C60 initially appears at room temperature as a second phase with K3C60. NH3K3C60, estimated from the x-ray intensity ratios, grows at the expense of K3C60 as the NH3 pressure is increased. At pressures between 400 and 1000 torr, NH3K3C60 is single phase at 100 degC. Once formed, NH3K3C60 remains even at 0 torr if the temperature is reduced to 25 degC. At temperatures higher than 200 degC and NH3 pressure < 1000 torr, NH3 is evolved and the structure reverts the K3C60. All the gas evolved from NH3K3C60 on heating is condensible at LN2 temperature showing that no H2 is formed at any stage of the intercalation or deintercalation. The amount of NH3 condensed, determined by measuring the pressure after expanding into a known volume, was found to be 0.95+-0.05 NH3/C60. The x-ray-diffraction pattern taken after deammonium shows single-phase fcc K3C60. The fitted lattice parameters at 400 torr NH3 pressure are 14.97+-14.89+-13.65 A, the same as those measured  after removing the NH3 pressure.7 The unit-cell volume of 761 A 3/C60 is 5% larger than that of the fcc K3C60. In the ammoniated compound, each octahedral K is coordinated with one NH3 and displaced away from the center of the octahedral site, which induces a structural distortion from cubic to orthorhombic. No NH3 is associated with the potassium atom on the tetrahedral site.

Further NH3 uptake and a structural transformation were observed when the NH3 pressure was raised above 500 torr, as shown in the lower x-ray pattern of Fig. 1(a). This pattern was obtained at room temperature with NH3 pressures in the range 500-1000 torr. The intensities of the peaks at 19.6 and 20.69deg 2_th_ (marked with arrows) were found to decrease with increasing NH3 pressure at room temperature, while the relative intensities and d spacings of the other reflections remained the same. This behavior indicates that the system is multiphase under these conditions and contains a new phase together with one or more additional phases.13 At a fixed pressure, no significant change in the x-ray powder pattern was observed over 24 h. Heating the sample to 110 degC at a fixed NH3 pressure of 500 torr, shown in Fig. 1(a) produced a release of NH3 and the formation of predominately NH3K3C60. Further heating the sample to 200 degC at 500 torr results in complete NH3 deintercalation and fcc K3C60.

_In-situ_ annealing for 2 h at pressures up to 1000 torr did not result in single-phase material of the new, higher NH3 pressure phase. We were successful, however, in obtaining a pattern that could be indexed as single phase by annealing for 10 h in a tube _sealed_ at 1000 torr NH3. (Unlike the _in-situ_ experiments, this is not a fixed-pressure measurement, since reaction of NH3 with K3C60 will reduce the pressure of NH3 in the tube.) After 10 h at 100 degC, the x-ray pattern evolved from one similar to the lower curve of Fig. 1(a) to the data shown in Fig. 1(b), where the diffuse background due to the glass capillary has been subtracted. Figure 1(b) can be indexed as a single phase with a number of different unit cells: two body-centered tetragonal cells with lattice parameters of 13.58 x 15.7, 13.51 x 9.64, or 12.15 x 15.7 A, as well as an orthorhombic cell of 13.28 x 11.09 x 9.68 A. Two of these cells have _c_-axis parameters are smaller than the C60 van der Waals diameter [if one excludes K-C60 bonding as proposed for RbC60 (Ref. [14])], while the 13.58 x 15.7 bct cell gives an unreasonably large unit-cell volume per fullerene molecule. The 12.15 x 15.7 A bct cell was therefore chosen as the most likely candidate. Intensity calculations were carried out using the LAZYPULVERIX (Ref. [15]) program using a spherical shell of charge to model the C60 molecule and Ne atoms (10 electrons each) to model ammonia molecules. In a separate experiment, monitoring the pressure change during NH3 uptake, the NH3 stoichiometry was calculated to be 10 +- - (C60. Using _14_/_mmm_ symmetry, a number of different orientations of NH3 consistent with this approximate stoichiometry were attempted. Approximate agreement of a model with the data were obtained using the model shown in Fig. 2(a). For comparison, a schematic drawing of the model of NH3K3C60 used in Ref. [7] is also shown in Fig. 2(b). In Fig. 2(a), ammonia molecules are located at sites (8_j_) (_x_, 1/2,0) and at (8_g_) (0, 1/2, 2) giving a composition of (NH3)8K3C60. A simulated x-ray powder pattern using the structural model is shown in Fig. 1(b) along with the data (with the diffuse background from the glass capillary subtracted). Fixing the all potassium-ammonia distances at 2.7 A, the same as in NH3K3C60 (Ref. [7]) gives x = 0.28 and z = 0.42. This model gives a rather short ammonia-ammonia distance across the (0,1.2,0) site of 2.5 A, however, the quality of the data requires that this model be taken as preliminary. All the model calculations do strongly suggest, however, that a structure with NH3 in both the octahedral and the tetrahedral sites is required.

### Electronic properties at low pressure

In our previous paper7 we reported that NH3K3C60 is noncubic and nonsuperconducting. Here, we first address the electronic properties of (NH3)xK3C60 at low NH3 pressure and correlate the results with the structural results reported above. As shown in Fig. 3, the room

The arrows indicate peaks from one or more additional phases. (b) A powder x-ray-diffraction pattern of (NH3)8K3C60 sealed at room temperature and 1000 torr of NH3 taken after annealing at 100 °C for 10 h. The lower curve is a simulated diffraction pattern calculated from a preliminary model structure for (NH3)8K3C60.

  temperature resistivity (\rho) of K3C60 films increases slowly with increasing NH3 pressure, from 2.3 mO cm at 0 torr to about 10 mO cm at 400 torr. The resistivity increases rapidly above 500 torr to 2200 mO cm at 840 torr. Upon reducing the pressure at room temperature, the resistivity exhibits a large hysteresis and stabilizes at 30 mO cm at 0 torr, about ten times higher than the value before NH3 exposure. Heating at 150 degC under dynamic vacuum for a few hours recovers the original resistivity of the K3C60 film, consistent with complete loss of ammonia. Resistivity measurements at 100 degC give a different result. At 100 degC, \rho increases continuously with increasing pressure up to 1000 torr, the highest pressure of the experiment. The rapid resistivity increase observed at 25 degC and 500 torr is absent. Lowering the temperature to room temperature at a fixed pressure above 500 torr results in an increase of \rho.

The above transport data can be rationalized on the basis of the phase formed in bulk samples under comparable conditions. On exposure to NH3 at conditions known to produce single phase NH3K3C60 (100 degC at 500 torr), the resistance of the metallic K3C60 film increases by a factor of 5-10. An insulating state is obtained _only_ under conditions that have been shown to produce a sample that is predominately the high NH3 pressure structure (25 degC at \geq 500 torr). The increase in the resistance as the film was cooled from 100 degC to room temperature at constant pressure is likely the result of the slow conversion of the film to the high pressure phase. One concludes from these data that the high NH3 pressure structure is insulating, however, our data do not exclude the possibility that NH3K3C60 could be metallic. A definitive test of the metallic character of NH3K3C60 is difficult, however, since all samples have some contamination with metallic K3C60.

### Electronic properties at hydrostatic pressure

The lack of superconductivity in NH3K3C60 despite chemical evidence of a half-filled band is surprising.7 Possible reasons for this fact could be either the occurrence of a Mott transition brought about by the increased in the intermolecular distances in the expanded unit cell or by suppression of the superconductivity due to granularity of the material. Either of these effects could be negated by the application of hydrostatic pressure. Our measurements show that, indeed, NH3K3C60 is superconducting under hydrostatic pressures. No observable change in the orthorhombic face-centered structure occurs in x-ray measurements at similar pressures. The temperature dependence of the ac susceptibility of NH3K3C60 measured between 0.1 and 14.8 kbar is shown in Fig. 4. At 1 bar, the data show a flat background and two small but sharp transitions at 19 and 7.2 K, from the minority K3C60 phase (as determined by x-ray diffraction)

The ammonia atom ordering shown (small circles) gives a stoichiometry of (NH3)_{x}K_{y}C60 and the calculated diffraction pattern shown in Fig. 1(b). (b) A schematic diagram of the structure of NH3K3C60 described in detail in Ref. 7. The unit cell has been rotated by 45° about the c axis to allow viewing of the octahedral and tetrahedral sites.

The position of K and NH3 within each octahedral site is random among four equivalent sites.

  and the Pb chip, respectively. Upon applying pressure, a broad transition appears at a higher temperature. The shielding fraction and the apparent onset temperature of this transition increase with increasing pressure, to 5% and 28 K at 14.8 kbar, respectively. At low pressure, the exact T_{c} is difficult to determine because of the low shielding fraction and the breadth of the transition. The signal is completely reversible upon pressure cycling. The superconducting transition temperature of the small amount of K3C60 in the sample decreases with increasing pressure with a slope of -0.62 K/kbar in agreement with previous measurements [16, 17].

Room-temperature powder diffraction patterns collected at 0.6 and 8 kbar are shown in Fig. 5, along with a calculated 1-bar pattern obtained using the 1-bar NH3K3C60 orthorhombic cell parameters [7] and Lazy-PULVERIX. [15] There is no observable change in the symmetry of the structure with pressure. Both patterns are consistent with the orthorhombic structure at 1 bar and neither can be indexed as cubic. The 8-kbar powder pattern is very similar to that obtained at 0.6 kbar, except the peaks are shifted to higher 2_th_'s and the intensities of the (202) and (022) peaks have increased. Due to the small number of broad, overlapping peaks, reliable unit cell parameters under pressure cannot be obtained from the present data. The Bragg peaks in Fig. 5 are broad because of the small particle size, rather than instrumental resolution. The widths are pressure independent over the pressure range studied. Approximate lattice parameters of a fit of the limited number of observed peaks to a _tetragonal_ cell give a=14.7 A and c=13.7 A at 8 kbar, a contraction from 1 bar of \Delta V/V\approx 3\%. A separate x-ray measurement using Cu \mathbf{K}_{\alpha} radiation shows that the room-temperature face-centered orthorhombic structure of NH3K3C60 is sustained at temperatures as low as 10 K.

Raman spectra measured at 1 bar from a sample sealed in a glass capillary, and at 0.6 kbar and 16 kbar from the powder in the diamond-anvil cell are shown in Fig. 6. At atmospheric pressure, the sample has a simple sharp A_{g} mode centered at 1448.5 cm-1, nearly the same as that reported for K3C60[18], indicating that C60 in the

  NH3K3C60 phase is in the 3-oxidation state. This result confirms our previous conclusion that ammoniation does not affect the charge transfer from alkali metal to C60. Under pressure the _A_g mode is upshifted, to 1454 cm-1 at 16 kbar. As in the case of pristine C60,19 the _A_g mode is broad and asymmetric at high pressure. The shift in the frequency of the _A_g mode is due to pressure-induced stiffening rather than phase separation or change in the C60 valence state. Assuming that the frequency of the _A_g mode shifts linearly with the applied pressure, as in the case for all the vibrational modes of pristine C60, one obtains a positive pressure slope of 0.31 cm-1/kbar, larger than the 0.17 cm-1/kbar slope reported for pristine C60.19 The results from both x-ray diffraction and Raman measurements therefore indicate that at room temperature there is no phase separation or structural transition under pressure. We do not expect the results to be different at low temperature and high pressure, as excess pressure compensates the temperature term in the free energy.

## IV Conclusions

Resistivity measurements of K3C60 films in gaseous NH3 and _in-situ_ x-ray measurements of K3C60 powder under NH3 have revealed new details about the NH3-K3C60 phase diagram. NH3K3C60 initially appears as a second phase at room temperature and 200 torr. The fraction of NH3K3C60 increases to 100% at 400 torr and 100 degC. Once formed, NH3K3C60 remains at room temperature and 0 torr. (The slow kinetics associated with NH3 intercalation and deintercalation makes the precise determination of the equilibrium NH3-K3C60 phase diagram difficult.) At room temperature and NH3 pressures 500-1000 torr, a new phase with 8-10 NH3 molecules per K3C60 formula unit becomes the dominant phase. This structure appears to become single phase after heating K3C60 sealed with 1000 torr NH3 to 100 degC. The data were not clean enough to refine a structural model, however, preliminary results indicate that the new structure contains NH3 on both the octahedral and tetrahedral interstitial sites, in contrast to NH3K3C60 and (NH3)4Na2CsC60. At room temperature, the high NH3 pressure phase appears to be electrically insulating.

The results reported in this paper show that in NH3K3C60 the charge transfer is unchanged from that of K3C60 and that the orthorhombic structure is stable at low temperature. This raises the question as to why ammoniation causes the loss of superconductivity in NH3K3C60 and why hydrostatic pressure recovers the superconductivity. We suggest as a possible reason the vicinity of the Mott limit. The Mott limit has been estimated to be near 2 mG cm for these materials,20 which is close to the measured resistivity of K3C60 thin films. After taking up one NH3 per C60 to form NH3K3C60, the resistivity increases by a factor of 5 to about 10 mG cm at room temperature. We note that, although the unit-cell volume of NH3K3C60 is comparable to that of the metallic Rb2CsC60, the intermolecular distances are anisotropic. In an {_hk_0} plane, the nearest-neighbor center-to-center intermolecular distance is 10.56 A, substantially larger than the value of 10.25 A in Rb2CsC60. We suggest that the additional expansion in {_hk_0} planes in NH3K3C60 could result in electron localization and induces a metal-insulator transition. As hydrostatic pressure causes primarily volume reduction in the a and b axes, this could consequently delocalize the t1_  * [12] Slow kinetics was evident in these experiments. In most cases, heating and cooling cycles from 25-100 degC aided phase formation. Phase formation occurred on the time scale of a few hours.
