An estimation of the electron-phonon interaction strength \lambda_{e,ph} is possible in terms of the McMillan formula.[17] Applying this model, and taking the repulsive screened Coulomb part \mu^{*} = 0.13, yields \lambda_{e,ph} = 0.8; this characterizes Mo_{3}Al_{2}C as a SC well beyond the weak-coupling limit.

The pressure dependence of T_{c} of Mo_{3}Al_{2}C is displayed in the inset of Fig. 2. Obviously, T_{c}(p) increases but tends to saturate for high pressures. An increase in T_{c} is rarely found in simple materials; rather, such a behavior frequently occurs in unconventional SCs like in high-temperature SCs, in various pyrochlores, in some Fe-pnictides, or heavy-fermion materials. Bogolyobov _et al.[18]_ demonstrated that there are two principal parameters determining T_{c} : \theta_{D} and the electronic density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy, N(E_{F}). Since the application of pressure hardly modifies \theta(T,p) in the normal-state region (not shown here), \theta_{D}(p) remains unchanged. Thus, a slight increase in N(E_{F}) is concluded, enhancing T_{c} on pressurizing Mo_{3}Al_{2}C.

Figure 3(a) shows the electronic temperature-dependent specific heat C_{cs}(T) of Mo_{3}Al_{2}C taken at 0 T and plotted as C_{cs}/T vs T^{2}. For subtracting the phonon background, high-field measurements were extrapolated to T \rightarrow 0 using a Debye temperature \theta_{D}=315 K (see also below). Bulk SC is evidenced from a distinct anomaly at 9 K, rendering the onset of the SC phase transition. A closer inspection of the data gives evidence of various non-BCS-type features: (i) the jump of the specific heat at T_{c}, \Delta C_{p}/(\gamma_{T}T_{c}) = 2.28, is well above the value expected for an s-wave BCS SC with \Delta C_{p}/(\gamma T_{c}) = 1.43. This hints at strong-coupling SC. (ii) The temperature-dependent heat capacity below T_{c} significantly deviates from the universal BCS dependence as indicated by the solid line. Rather, a power law with C_{p}(T < T_{c}) \propto T^{3} is obvious from the experimental data above 3 K (compare Fig. 3), which is sketched by the dashed line as well. Below 3 K, the heat-capacity data reveal an anomaly at about 1 K [see also Fig. 4(a)], which may be attributed either to a tiny fraction of impurity states or to a quite complicated gap structure, where a small fraction of the Fermi surface exhibits a very small gap which opens just at the lowest temperatures. Due to the low-temperature anomaly in the heat capacity it remains unclear whether or not C_{cs} of Mo_{3}Al_{2}C is compatible with a nodal structure. A clean exponential temperature dependence is not observed in the present study.

The 1/T_{1}^{27}Al NMR relaxation rate, taken at \mu_{0}H = 1.24 T and partially at 6.95 T is plotted in Fig. 3(b) on a double logarithmic scale. A Hebbel-Slichter peak right at T_{c} is absent. This is compatible with a partial disappearance of the SC gap at the Fermi energy, in line with non-s-wave SC. Below T_{c}, a nonexponential but rather a T^{n} temperature dependence hints toward a nodal structure, closing partially the SC gap at the Fermi surface. We note that a 1/T_{1} \propto T component, expected as a signature of a finite impurity density of

  states, is clearly absent in our low-temperature data. Volovik and Gork'ov[20] have shown that a proportionality of the density of states according to N(E)\!\propto\!E^{m} results in a NMR relaxation rate 1/T_{1}\!\propto\!T^{2m\!+\!1}. Thus, an anisotropic gap with nodal structures yields, in general, a T^{*} power law of 1/T_{1} with n\!=\!3 for line nodes and n\!=\!5 for point nodes. Intersecting nodes, however, might modify such simple temperature dependencies.[21] Furthermore, Hayashi _et al.[22]_ demonstrated that NCS SCs with mixed spin-singlet and spin-triplet states infer a rather unconventional 1/T_{1} relaxation rate.

Summarized in Fig. 4(a) is the field- and temperature-dependent heat capacity of Mo_{3}Al_{2}C, highlighting the suppression of SC upon the application of a magnetic field. The fact that even fields of 11 T do not suppress superconductivity evidences a large upper critical field \mu_{0}H_{c2} as well as a large initial slope \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\prime}. The extension of the normal-state behavior toward lower temperatures with rising magnetic fields allows to obtain in a standard manner the Sommerfeld value \gamma\!=\!17.8 mJ/mol K^{2} and \theta_{D}\!\approx\!315 K [compare Fig. 4(a), inset]. The accurate determination of \gamma and of T_{c}(\mu_{0}H) was accomplished by idealizing the heat-capacity anomaly under the constraint of entropy balance between the superconducting and the normal state. T_{c}(\mu_{0}H) obtained from Fig. 4(a) is plotted in Fig. 4(b) revealing the upper critical field \mu_{0}H_{c2}\!>\!11 T and the slope of the upper critical field \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\prime}\!=\!\!-3 T/K.

The temperature dependency of \mu_{0}H_{c2} is described following the model of Werthammer _et al.[23]_, incorporating orbital pair breaking, the effect of Pauli spin paramagnetism and spin-orbit scattering. Two parameters, the Maki parameter \alpha (Pauli paramagnetic limitation) (Ref. [24]) and spin-orbit scattering \lambda_{so} specify this model. While an increase in \alpha decrements the upper critical field, an increase in \lambda_{so} compensates the former, restoring for \lambda_{so}\!\rightarrow\!\infty a maximum field constrained from orbital pair breaking only. In a first approximation, the Maki parameter \alpha can be derived from \gamma and \rho_{0}.[23] resulting in \alpha\!=\!1.32. Alternatively, \alpha can be estimated from \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\prime},[24] revealing \alpha^{*}\!=\!1.6. The sizable Maki parameter of both approximations is an indication that Pauli limiting is non-negligible in Mo_{3}Al_{2}C.

Using \alpha\!=\!1.32 (\alpha^{*}\!=\!1.6) and \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\prime}\!=\!\!-3 T/K yields \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T) as displayed as solid and dashed lines in Fig. 4(b) for \lambda_{so}\!=\!1.4 and \lambda_{so}\!=\!2.5, respectively, with \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) = 15.7 T. The Pauli-limiting field follows from \mu_{0}H_{p}(0) = \sqrt{2}\mu_{0}H^{\prime}(0)/\alpha, where \mu_{0}H^{\prime}(0)\!=\!18.72 T, is the Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg (WHH) result for \alpha\!=\!0, i.e., the orbital limit. Thus, \mu_{0}H_{p}(0)\!=\!20 T for the former and 16.5 T for the latter value of \alpha. These values are in line with \mu_{0}H_{p}(1.2 K)\!=\!15.6 T reported by Fink _et al.[25]_ in the case of strong-coupling superconductivity, these values are further enhanced according to H_{p}^{\prime\prime\prime}(0)\!=\!H_{p}(0)(1\!+\!\lambda_{so,ph})^{\epsilon} with \epsilon\!=\!0.5

The horizontal bar indicates the upper critical field \mu_{0}H^{\prime\prime}(0) in absence of Pauli limiting.

  or 1.0.26, 27 Hence, Pauli limiting is not the principal mechanism restricting the upper critical field in Mo_{3}Al_{2}C but is present in a relevant size.

The thermodynamic critical field \mu_{0}H_{c}(T) derived in a standard manner from heat-capacity data (compare, e.g., Ref. [8]) is shown in Fig. 4(b) by open squares; an extrapolation to T\!\rightarrow\!0 (dashed-dotted line) yields \mu_{0}H_{c}(0)\!=\!0.146 T.

SC and normal-state parameters of Mo_{3}Al_{2}C can be assessed from g, \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\prime}, \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0), and \mu_{0}.26, 28 From the Ginzburg-Landau theory with the thermodynamic critical field as primary input, the coherence length, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter and the London penetration depth are calculated. Parameters are summarized in Table 1. Based on the estimate l_{tr}/\xi\!\approx\!0.66 we classify Mo_{3}Al_{2}C as a superconductor in the dirty limit; \kappa_{GL}\!=\!76 refers to a type-II superconductor.

A section of the calculated electronic DOS of Mo_{3}Al_{2}C is shown in Fig. 5 for a relativistic calculation including spin-orbit coupling (upper panel). The DOS around the Fermi energy stems primarily from Mo 4d states while the contribution of Al and C is almost negligible. The low partial Al DOS calculated at E_{F} corresponds well to the NMR Korringa constant, T_{1}T\!=\!11 sK [1/T_{1}T\!\propto\!N(E_{F})^{2}]. A comparison with Al metal (T_{1}T\!=\!1.8 sK) reveals a local Al DOS in Mo_{3}Al_{2}C of about 3% with respect to the total DFT DOS.

The Fermi energy E_{F} of Mo_{3}Al_{2}C is located in a local maximum of the DOS; its large value favors SC. Employing the Sommerfeld expansion, N(E_{F})\!=\!5.48 states/eV corresponds to \gamma_{b}\!=\!12.9 mJ/mol K^{2}, in fair agreement with the experimental Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma\!=\!\gamma_{b}(1\!+\!\lambda_{e,ph})\!=\!17.8 mJ/mol K^{2}.

The lower panel of Fig. 5 displays the DFT electronic band structures along high symmetry directions for Mo_{3}Al_{2}C in an energy range \pm\!1 eV around the Fermi energy. With respect to a nonrelativistic calculation (not shown here), the degenerate bands become split due to the lack of inversion symmetry in Mo_{3}Al_{2}C. Specifically, for all bands crossing the Fermi energy the degeneracy is lifted, separating spin-up and spin-down electrons. This provides conditions for the occurrence of spin-singlet and spin-triplet Cooper pairs, leading to two gap functions, where each gap is defined on one of the two bands formed by degeneracy lifting. Superposition of these gaps is presumed to constitute a nodal structure of the resulting SC gap as corroborated from the present experimental data.

In conclusion, electrical resistivity, specific-heat, and NMR measurements classify noncentrosymmetric Mo_{3}Al_{2}C as a strong-coupled SC with T_{c}\!=\!9 K. The temperature-dependent specific heat and the 1/T_{1}^{27}Al NMR relaxation rate deviate from BCS predictions, possibly referring to a nodal structure of the superconducting gap even though SC of Mo_{3}Al_{2}C occurs in the dirty limit. Unconventional pairing would be in line with the splitting of electronic bands due to the asymmetric spin-orbit coupling as revealed from relativistic DFT calculations. These split bands might be the cause of a mixing of spin-singlet and spin-triplet Cooper pairs, which otherwise are distinguished by parity, [2] making a nodal structure likely. [22, 29] While this proposition has been corroborated for SCs with strong correlations among electrons, specific-heat data unambiguously disprove a strongly correlated electronic state in Mo_{3}Al_{2}C. In spite of a lack of correlations, unconventional SC seems to arise from a substantial band splitting and the fact that inversion symmetry is missing in _all_ crystallographic directions. In these respects, Mo_{3}Al_{2}C is the only example besides isomorphous Li_{2}Pt_{3}B. [9]

_Note added._ Recently, we learned that SC in Mo_{3}Al_{2}C was also studied by Karki _et al._[30] who claimed an exponential temperature dependence of the low-temperature electronic specific heat C_{eS}(T) and concluded that the gap fully opens. We note that the accuracy of low-temperature electronic specific-heat data obtained by subtracting a phonon contribution extremely depends on the accuracy by which the normal-state heat capacity has been determined from high-field measurements. The low-temperature electronic heat capacity C_{eS}(T\!<\!2.5 K) obtained in the present study clearly deviates from that proposed in Ref. [30] [see dashed-dotted line in Fig. 3(a)].

While an increase in \alpha decrements the upper critical field, an increase in \lambda_{so} compensates the former, restoring for \lambda_{so}\!\rightarrow\!\infty a maximum field constrained from orbital pair breaking only. In a first approximation, the Maki parameter \alpha can be derived from \gamma and \rho_{0}.[23] resulting in \alpha\!=\!1.32. Alternatively, \alpha can be estimated from \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\prime},[24] revealing \alpha^{*}\!=\!1.6. The sizable Maki parameter of both approximations is an indication that Pauli limiting is non-negligible in Mo_{3}Al_{2}C.

Using \alpha\!=\!1.32 (\alpha^{*}\!=\!1.6) and \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\prime}\!=\!\!-3 T/K yields \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T) as displayed as solid and dashed lines in Fig. 4(b) for \lambda_{so}\!=\!1.4 and \lambda_{so}\!=\!2.5, respectively, with \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) = 15.7 T. The Pauli-limiting field follows from \mu_{0}H_{p}(0) = \sqrt{2}\mu_{0}H^{\prime}(0)/\alpha, where \mu_{0}H^{\prime}(0)\!=\!18.72 T, is the Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg (WHH) result for \alpha\!=\!0, i.e., the orbital limit. Thus, \mu_{0}H_{p}(0)\!=\!20 T for the former and 16.5 T for the latter value of \alpha. These values are in line with \mu_{0}H_{p}(1.2 K)\!=\!15.6 T reported by Fink _et al.[25]_ in the case of strong-coupling superconductivity, these values are further enhanced according to H_{p}^{\prime\prime\prime}(0)\!=\!H_{p}(0)(1\!+\!\lambda_{so,ph})^{\epsilon} with \epsilon\!=\!0.5

The solid and the long-dashed lines are fits according to the WHH model for different values of the Maki parameter. The horizontal bar indicates the upper critical field \mu_{0}H^{\prime\prime}(0) in absence of Pauli limiting.

  or 1.0.26, 27 Hence, Pauli limiting is not the principal mechanism restricting the upper critical field in Mo_{3}Al_{2}C but is present in a relevant size.

The thermodynamic critical field \mu_{0}H_{c}(T) derived in a standard manner from heat-capacity data (compare, e.g., Ref. [8]) is shown in Fig. 4(b) by open squares; an extrapolation to T\!\rightarrow\!0 (dashed-dotted line) yields \mu_{0}H_{c}(0)\!=\!0.146 T.

SC and normal-state parameters of Mo_{3}Al_{2}C can be assessed from g, \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\prime}, \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0), and \mu_{0}.26, 28 From the Ginzburg-Landau theory with the thermodynamic critical field as primary input, the coherence length, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter and the London penetration depth are calculated. Parameters are summarized in Table 1. Based on the estimate l_{tr}/\xi\!\approx\!0.66 we classify Mo_{3}Al_{2}C as a superconductor in the dirty limit; \kappa_{GL}\!=\!76 refers to a type-II superconductor.

A section of the calculated electronic DOS of Mo_{3}Al_{2}C is shown in Fig. 5 for a relativistic calculation including spin-orbit coupling (upper panel). The DOS around the Fermi energy stems primarily from Mo 4d states while the contribution of Al and C is almost negligible. The low partial Al DOS calculated at E_{F} corresponds well to the NMR Korringa constant, T_{1}T\!=\!11 sK [1/T_{1}T\!\propto\!N(E_{F})^{2}]. A comparison with Al metal (T_{1}T\!=\!1.8 sK) reveals a local Al DOS in Mo_{3}Al_{2}C of about 3% with respect to the total DFT DOS.

The Fermi energy E_{F} of Mo_{3}Al_{2}C is located in a local maximum of the DOS; its large value favors SC. Employing the Sommerfeld expansion, N(E_{F})\!=\!5.48 states/eV corresponds to \gamma_{b}\!=\!12.9 mJ/mol K^{2}, in fair agreement with the experimental Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma\!=\!\gamma_{b}(1\!+\!\lambda_{e,ph})\!=\!17.8 mJ/mol K^{2}.

The lower panel of Fig. 5 displays the DFT electronic band structures along high symmetry directions for Mo_{3}Al_{2}C in an energy range \pm\!1 eV around the Fermi energy. With respect to a nonrelativistic calculation (not shown here), the degenerate bands become split due to the lack of inversion symmetry in Mo_{3}Al_{2}C. Specifically, for all bands crossing the Fermi energy the degeneracy is lifted, separating spin-up and spin-down electrons. This provides conditions for the occurrence of spin-singlet and spin-triplet Cooper pairs, leading to two gap functions, where each gap is defined on one of the two bands formed by degeneracy lifting. Superposition of these gaps is presumed to constitute a nodal structure of the resulting SC gap as corroborated from the present experimental data.

In conclusion, electrical resistivity, specific-heat, and NMR measurements classify noncentrosymmetric Mo_{3}Al_{2}C as a strong-coupled SC with T_{c}\!=\!9 K. The temperature-dependent specific heat and the 1/T_{1}^{27}Al NMR relaxation rate deviate from BCS predictions, possibly referring to a nodal structure of the superconducting gap even though SC of Mo_{3}Al_{2}C occurs in the dirty limit. Unconventional pairing would be in line with the splitting of electronic bands due to the asymmetric spin-orbit coupling as revealed from relativistic DFT calculations. These split bands might be the cause of a mixing of spin-singlet and spin-triplet Cooper pairs, which otherwise are distinguished by parity, [2] making a nodal structure likely. [22, 29] While this proposition has been corroborated for SCs with strong correlations among electrons, specific-heat data unambiguously disprove a strongly correlated electronic state in Mo_{3}Al_{2}C. In spite of a lack of correlations, unconventional SC seems to arise from a substantial band splitting and the fact that inversion symmetry is missing in _all_ crystallographic directions. In these respects, Mo_{3}Al_{2}C is the only example besides isomorphous Li_{2}Pt_{3}B. [9]

_Note added._ Recently, we learned that SC in Mo_{3}Al_{2}C was also studied by Karki _et al._[30] who claimed an exponential temperature dependence of the low-temperature electronic specific heat C_{eS}(T) and concluded that the gap fully opens. We note that the accuracy of low-temperature electronic specific-heat data obtained by subtracting a phonon contribution extremely depends on the accuracy by which the normal-state heat capacity has been determined from high-field measurements. The low-temperature electronic heat capacity C_{eS}(T\!<\!2.5 K) obtained in the present study clearly deviates from that proposed in Ref. [30] [see dashed-dotted line in Fig. 3(a)].
