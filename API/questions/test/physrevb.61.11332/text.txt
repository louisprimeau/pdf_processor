###### Abstract

A systematic study on the nature of Pr doping in Bi\({}_{2}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ca\({}_{3-x}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) (0.2\(\leq\)x\(\leq\)0.6) has been made on films grown by laser ablation. These films are a metastable Bi-2212 phase which has not yet been grown in this doping range by other methods. The film with \(x\) = 0.2 shows the highest zero-resistance temperature (_Tcz_) of about 65 K. _Tcz_ of the films decreases with increasing Pr content yielding a metal-to-insulator transition for \(x\) > 0.5. By analyzing x-ray photoelectron spectra we show that Pr is trivalent. From this we are able to demonstrate that the variation of _Tcz_ with doping is predominantly due to hole filling induced by the trivalent Pr.

## I Introduction

Most materials of the LnBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) system (Ln: lanthanide and Y) exhibit superconductivity at about 90 K, and the value of the critical temperature (_Tcz_) does not change dramatically [1, 2] with the change of the element Ln. One exception to this behavior is insulating PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\), and some experimental results indicate that valence of Pr in PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) is trivalent, while others indicate tetravalent (Refs. 3 and 4). To explain its nonsuperconductivity, many models have been proposed: (i) hole filling due to Pr\({}^{4+}\) ion, [4] (ii) replacement of Ba site with Pr\({}^{3+}\) (Ref. 5) and (iii) localization of holes by hybridization of Pr 4\(f\) and O 2\(p\) orbitals. [4, 6] Among them, the model of hybridization has been widely accepted, though Blackstead _et al._ pointed out that the model cannot explain the difference in Pr content \(y\), at which superconductivity disappears, and \(|d\)_Tcz_/_dy_| between Y1\({}_{-\gamma}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) and Y1\({}_{-\gamma}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) shows, [7]

Recently, however, bulk superconductivity has been observed in the single crystal of PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) prepared by the traveling-solvent floating-zone (TSFZ) method. [8, 9, 10] The results showed: Superconductivity of the sample was very sensitive to the growth condition, the valence of Pr was trivalent in the sample, and the lattice parameter \(c\) of the sample was longer than the nonsuperconducting sample. Further, in the LnBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) system (Ln: lanthanide and Y), only the superconducting PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) compound showed large _Tc_ enhancement under a high pressure; [9, 10, 11] the maximum increase of _Tc_ was by about 50 K and the value of _Tcz_ was 105 K. However, neither the reason for the difference between the superconducting and nonsuperconducting PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) compounds nor the reason why only the superconducting PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) compound has large pressure effect on _Tc_ among the materials of the LnBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) system has yet been understood. Therefore it is interesting to investigate other superconductors containing Pr and to compare them with the PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) compound.

The Bi-2212 phase in the Bi-Pr-Ca-Cu-O system is a superconductor containing Pr prepared by solid-state reaction. The crystal structure of the compound was reported to be similar to the Bi-2212 phase of Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\), and the sample of Bi\({}_{2}\)Pr\({}_{0.5}\)Ca\({}_{2.5}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) (Ref. 12) showed the highest zero resistivity temperature (_Tcz_) of 45 K among the materials of the Bi\({}_{2}\)Ln\({}_{x}\)Ca\({}_{3-x}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) systems [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] (Ln=La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd). However, in the Bi\({}_{2}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ca\({}_{3-x}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) system, an almost single phase sample could be obtained only for the limited composition of \(x\) = 0.5, and other samples were of the multiphase. On the other hand, the thin-film preparation method allows one to make metastable Bi-2212 phase that cannot be synthesized by solid-state reaction. For example, an almost single Bi-2212 phase sample in the bulk Bi\({}_{2}\)La\({}_{x}\)Ca\({}_{3-x}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) system was only \(x\) = 0.5 (Ref. 12), while thin-film preparation method has been able to make the Bi-2212 phase with a wide composition range, [18] 0.2\(\leq\)x\(\leq\)0.7.

We have prepared the Bi-2212 films with the wide composition range of Pr, and have investigated the role of Pr for superconductivity in the Bi\({}_{2}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ca\({}_{3-x}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) system. In this paper, we report on the preparation and physical properties of Bi-2212 thin films of this system.

## II Experiment

The films were synthesized by the laser ablation method using Bi\({}_{2}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ca\({}_{3-x}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) compound targets. First, pellets for the target were prepared by solid-state reaction. High purity powders of Bi\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), Pr\({}_{6}\)O\({}_{11}\), CaCO\({}_{3}\), and CuO were mixed to a nominal composition of Bi\({}_{2}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ca\({}_{3-x}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) and pressed to pellets, which were heated at 820 degC for 10 h in air. The pellets for the target were reground, pressed, and sintered at 820 degC for 10 h in air again. The targets were placed in a high-vacuum chamber at a base pressure of 1.0 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-7}\) Torr and ablated by a pulsed KrF excimer laser (\(\lambda\) = 248 nm, \(\tau\)= 23 ns, 100 mJ/pulse) in 0.02 Torr oxygen  flow. The energy density of the laser at the target was 1.0 J/cm\({}^{2}\), and the pulse repetition rate was 4.0 Hz. The ablated materials were deposited on the MgO (100) substrate placed at a distance of 3.0 cm from the target in the chamber. The thickness of the films was 1.5 \(\mu\)m, and the deposition rate of the films was 3.0 \(\AA\) per laser shot.

For the Bi\({}_{2}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ca\({}_{3-x}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) films, the substrate temperatures were monitored by an optical pyrometer and were kept at 600-670 \({}^{\circ}\)C. After the deposition, O\({}_{2}\) annealing treatment was performed under 1 atm O\({}_{2}\) flow for 30 min at the temperature of 760-820 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The substrate and annealing temperatures of the films are summarized in Table 1.

X-ray-diffraction patterns were obtained with a diffractometer using Cu\(K\alpha\) radiation. The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity (\(\rho\) vs \(T\)) was measured by the dc four-probe method. The temperature dependence of magnetization (\(M\) vs \(T\)) was measured with a dc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. The composition of the films was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy\(-\)x-ray energy dispersion spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed using Mg\(K\alpha\) radiation.

## III Results

X-ray-diffraction patterns of the Bi-2212 thin films in the Bi\({}_{2}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ca\({}_{3-x}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) system (0.2\(\leq\)_x_\(\approx\)0.6) are shown in Fig. 1. From the figure, we can see that most of the diffraction peaks can be attributed to the \(c\)-axis oriented Bi-2212 phase. However, the impurity phase of Bi-Ca-O is mixed to a larger extent for smaller Pr content \(x\). Though results for the films with _x_\(<\)0.2 are not shown in the figure, these films have been found to be of the multiphase consisting of the Bi-2212 phase, Bi-Ca-O and other unknown impurity phases. The result indicates that Pr is necessary to stabilize the 2212 structure.

On the other hand, the film with \(x\) = 0.6 contains Bi-2212 and Bi-2223 phases of the Bi-Pr-Ca-Cu-O system together with unknown phases. The fact that the film contains the Bi-2223 phase shows the existence of the Bi-2223 phase in the Bi-Pr-Ca-Cu-O system. The detailed result of the Bi-2223 phase will be published elsewhere.[19] When \(x\) exceeds 0.6, the samples become of the mixed phase consisting of the present Bi-2212 phase, the Bi-2201 phase of the Bi-Pr-Ca-Cu-O system[20] and impurity phases. These results indicate that the composition range of Pr to stabilize the 2212 structure is 0.2\(\leq\)_x_\(\approx\)0.6. This result is in contrast to the bulk Bi-2212 phase of Bi\({}_{2}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ca\({}_{3-x}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\), as only for \(x\) = 0.5 an almost single phase was obtained.[12] From these results, we can emphasize that the present thin-film processing method is one of the most useful methods to prepare new metastable phases.

\(M\) vs \(T\) for the Bi-2212 films in the Bi\({}_{2}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ca\({}_{3-x}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) system is shown in Fig. 2. The measurement was performed on heating after cooling within a magnetic field of 200 G, which was applied parallel to the \(c\) axis of the film. In the

  figure, the film with \(x\) = 0.2 shows the highest starting temperature of diamagnetic signal (_Tc__m_), and its value decreases with increasing Pr content \(x\). The film with \(x\) = 0.5 does not show the diamagnetic signal. The _Tc__m_ value of each film is shown in Table I. The result indicates that the Bi2PrCa3-_x_Cu2O8+_d_ film changes from a superconductor to a nonsuperconductor with increasing \(x\).

\(r\) vs \(T\) for the Bi-2212 films in the Bi2PrCa3-_x_Cu2O8+_d_ system is shown in Fig. 3. From the figure, we can see that the film with \(x\) = 0.2 shows the highest zero resistivity temperature (_Tc__c_) at 65 K in the system. This value is higher by 20 K than that of the bulk sample.12 Moreover, the starting temperature of resistivity drop (_Tc__s_), the middle temperature between _Tc__s_ and _Tc__c_; (_Tc__c_mid) and _Tc__c_ of the films decreased with increasing Pr content \(x\). When \(x\) exceeded 0.5, metal-insulator transition occurred and the film with \(x\) = 0.6 showed semiconductorlike temperature dependence with no trace of resistivity drop.

From the magnetic and resistivity measurements of the Bi2PrCa3-_x_Cu2O8+_d_ films, it is clear that _Tc_ of the film decreases with increasing Pr content \(x\), and the film changes from a superconductor to an insulator. From the results mentioned in the previous section, we have found that _Tc__c_'s of Bi-2212 films in the Bi2PrCa3-_x_Cu2O8+_d_ system decrease with increasing Pr content \(x\). In order to clarify the origin of this decrease in _Tc__c_, we need to address the valence of Pr. From the experimental results described below, we are able to show that Pr is trivalent.

Figure 4 shows XPS spectra in the binding-energy range of 100 to 140 eV for the Bi2PrCa3-_x_Cu2O8+_d_ films (0.2 \(\leq\)_x_ \(\leq\)0.6) as well as the bulk compounds Pr6O11 and Pr2CuO4. In the case of the Pr6O11 compound, the peak of Pr 4\(d\) is observed at the binding energy of about 115 eV; and an additional structure denoted by 4\(f\),1 at the energy of about 126 eV. The former shows the existence of Pr3+, and the latter, the existence of Pr4+ (Ref. [3]). Since the valence of Pr is trivalent in the Pr2CuO4 compound, the peak of Pr 4\(d\) (115 eV) is observed without the 4\(f\) (Ref. [3]) peak. On the other hand, in the Bi2PrCa3-_x_Cu2O8+_d_ system, the peaks of Pr 4\(d\) and Cu 3\(s\) are present3 at 115 and 121 eV and the peak intensity of Pr 4\(d\) increases with increasing Pr content \(x\). However, the 4\(f\) (Ref. [3]) peak which shows the existence of Pr4+ is absent. The Pr 4\(d\) spectra of the films is similar to the Pr2CuO4 compound than the Pr6O11 compound though there is a shoulder on the low-energy side of the Pr 4\(d\) peak. From the result, we conclude that the valence of Pr is trivalent in the films.

Finally, we discuss the role of Pr3+ for superconductivity in the system. In Fig. 5, the variations, with Pr content \(x\) and hole concentration \(p\), of _Tc__c_mid in the Bi2PrCa3-_x_Cu2O8+_d_ system are shown (closed triangles). The data of the Bi2Sr2PrCa1-_x_Cu2O8+_d_ (open triangles) is cited from Ref. [21] for comparison. The hole concentration \(p\) of the systems has been calculated by the formula

\[p = 0.3 - x/2\]

by assuming the following experimental facts of the Bi2Sr2PrCa1-_x_Cu2O8+_d_ system: (i) the oxygen content of the system is a constant independently of Pr content \(x\), (ii) Pr is trivalent, (iii) one Pr3+ atom substituted for a Ca2+ atom diminishes one hole, and (iv) the hole concentration \(p\) in

Figure 5: Variations of _Tc__c_mid in the Bi2PrCa3−_x_Cu2O8+_d_ system with 0.2 \(x\) \(\leq\)0.6 as a function of Pr content \(x\) and hole concentration \(p\) (closed triangle). The data of the Bi2Sr2PrCa1−_x_Cu2O8+_d_ system (open triangle) (Ref. [21]) are given for comparison. The hole concentration \(p\) of the systems was calculated by the formula \(p\) = 0.3 − _x_/2 (see the text).

  [CuO]+_p_ is 0.3 for \(x\) = 0.0. As shown in the figure, the two systems show the parabolalike correlation of _T__c_mid with \(p\), that is, _T__c_mid increases with increasing hole concentration \(p\), takes on a maximum at \(p\) = 0.2 and then decreases. Therefore the decrease of \(T_{c}\) in the system is interpreted in terms of hole filling due to the substitution of Pr3+ for Ca2+.

## IV Conclusion

We have synthesized Bi-2212 thin films of the Bi2Pr\({}_{x}\)Ca\({}_{3-x}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) system prepared by the laser ablation method. For this system, the Bi-2212 films were obtained in a wide composition range, 0.2\(\leq\)_x_ \(\leq\) 0.6. The films in this composition range were of the metastable Bi-2212 phase that have not been produced by solid-state reaction except the film with \(x\) = 0.5. The film with \(x\) = 0.2 showed the highest values of _T__c_m and _T__c_z at about 75 and 65 K in the system. The value of _T__c_z was higher by about 20 K than that previously reported for the bulk Bi-2212 sample. Further, \(T_{c}\) of the films decreased with increasing Pr content \(x\), and metal-insulator transition occurred when \(x\) exceeded 0.5. The variation of \(T_{c}\) was explained in terms of hole filling due to the replacement of Ca2+ with Pr3+.
