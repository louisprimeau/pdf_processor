21 June 201020121 Fig. 1 displays a SEM image. EDX composition mapping
identified two distinct phases in the CaIrSi₃ sample, with approximate
cation ratios Ca:Ir:Si = 1:1.03:2.95, consistent with CaIrSi₃, and
Ca:Ir:Si = 1:0:2.28. The Ir-free phase did not appear in XRD, suggesting
it to be solidified melt without a well-defined crystal structure.

Single-phase CaIrSi₃ grains of size ∼200 μm were isolated using dilute
hydrochloric acid, then crushed. Homogeneous micron-sized grains were
selected using an ethanol suspension, then sealed in a Lindemann glass
capillary of internal diameter 0.2 mm. High-resolution synchrotron XRD
measurements were performed in transmission mode at the SPring-8 BL02B2
beam line using N₂ gas-flow temperature control and a large
Debye-Scherrer camera with an imaging plate detector [18] which was set
up to collect data from 0.010 to 78.68^(∘) in 2θ, with a resolution of
0.010^(∘). Data were collected at a series of temperatures from 90 to
300 K with exposure times of 5 minutes, and a higher-statistics dataset
with a 60-minute exposure time was taken on a different sample at 100 K
for structure refinement. The highest peak in the latter dataset had
approximately 1,100,000 counts. An incident x-ray wavelength of 0.357
47(1) A was used, calibrated with a CeO₂ standard.

No technique was found that would result in single-phase CaPtSi₃ grains,
but aqua regia dissolved most impurities, and it was also possible to
isolate CaPtSi₃-free grains of the remaining impurity phases. Spectra
with and without CaPtSi₃ were collected as for CaIrSi₃, using a
wavelength of 0.351 190(12) A, but without a high-statistics dataset. By
comparing the CaPtSi₃ and impurity-phase spectra, reflections associated
with impurity phases could be deleted, allowing structure refinements
for CaPtSi₃ as shown in Fig. 1. The previously mentioned limitations
require that the CaPtSi₃ XRD results be treated with caution, but they
should provide a useful starting point.

Both compounds’ lattice parameters increase monotonically with
temperature by less than 0.4

Figure 3 and Table 1 report the results of a Rietveld structure
refinement performed on the higher-statistics CaIrSi₃ data using the
program Synchrotron-Powder, [19] using 1086 reflections from 2.500^(∘)
to 75.000^(∘). The reliability factors based on the weighted profile,
$R_{\rm{up}}$, and on the Bragg intensities, $R_{\rm{l}}$, were 4.30

scanning electron micrograph of CaIrSi₃. The sample contained an
impurity phase. The EDX result reveals the bright area to be CaIrSi₃ and
the dark area to have the approximate cation ratio of Ca:Ir:Si =
1:0:2.28.

respectively. The results of the refinement at 100 K are reported in
Table 2.

## III III. Superconducting properties

### A. Dc susceptibility and resistivity

Using polycrystalline samples, dc susceptibility measurements were
performed with a commercial Superconducting Quantum Interference Device
(SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS-XL) down to 1.8 K, and
resistivity measurements were performed with a commercial instrument
(Quantum Design, PPMS) with a ³He refrigeration insert down to 0.35 K
using a conventional four-probe technique. Resistivity in zero field up
to 300 K for each compound is exhibited in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The
temperature dependence of the resistivity indicates typical metallic
behavior with residual resistivity ratios (RRR, ρ_(300K)/ρ₅₈) of ∼4 for
CaIrSi₃ and ∼1.6 for CaPtSi₃. The low-temperature resistivity and the

subunits to be described. As ScRh₃Si₇, it was portrayed as an array of
Sc(Ca)-centered Rh(Ir) octahedra and Si double tetrahedra in which the
shared apex was the Si(2) site.[26] However, since the shortest bonds in
the material are those between Rh(Ir) and Si, it may be more realistic
to visualize the structure in terms of slightly twisted Si-centered
Ir₃Si₇ barrels and isolated Ca atoms. A crystal structure based on this
scheme is presented in Fig. 8.
