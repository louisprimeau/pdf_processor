21 June 201020121  Fig. 1 displays a SEM image. EDX composition mapping identified two distinct phases in the CaIrSi_{3} sample, with approximate cation ratios Ca:Ir:Si = 1:1.03:2.95, consistent with CaIrSi_{3}, and Ca:Ir:Si = 1:0:2.28. The Ir-free phase did not appear in XRD, suggesting it to be solidified melt without a well-defined crystal structure.

Single-phase CaIrSi_{3} grains of size \sim200 \mum were isolated using dilute hydrochloric acid, then crushed. Homogeneous micron-sized grains were selected using an ethanol suspension, then sealed in a Lindemann glass capillary of internal diameter 0.2 mm. High-resolution synchrotron XRD measurements were performed in transmission mode at the SPring-8 BL02B2 beam line using N_{2} gas-flow temperature control and a large Debye-Scherrer camera with an imaging plate detector [18] which was set up to collect data from 0.010 to 78.68^{\circ} in 2\theta, with a resolution of 0.010^{\circ}. Data were collected at a series of temperatures from 90 to 300 K with exposure times of 5 minutes, and a higher-statistics dataset with a 60-minute exposure time was taken on a different sample at 100 K for structure refinement. The highest peak in the latter dataset had approximately 1,100,000 counts. An incident x-ray wavelength of 0.357 47(1) A was used, calibrated with a CeO_{2} standard.

No technique was found that would result in single-phase CaPtSi_{3} grains, but aqua regia dissolved most impurities, and it was also possible to isolate CaPtSi_{3}-free grains of the remaining impurity phases. Spectra with and without CaPtSi_{3} were collected as for CaIrSi_{3}, using a wavelength of 0.351 190(12) A, but without a high-statistics dataset. By comparing the CaPtSi_{3} and impurity-phase spectra, reflections associated with impurity phases could be deleted, allowing structure refinements for CaPtSi_{3} as shown in Fig. 1. The previously mentioned limitations require that the CaPtSi_{3} XRD results be treated with caution, but they should provide a useful starting point.

Both compounds' lattice parameters increase monotonically with temperature by less than 0.4% over the temperature range probed, as displayed in Fig. 2 for CaIrSi_{3}. In this compound only, a small slope change in the c-axis lattice parameter can be seen at 200 K, and the c-axis position of the Si(2) (Ir-Si layer) site appears to fall by about 0.005 A above this temperature, making the Ir-Si layer slightly flatter. The above changes were reflected in the interatomic distances.

Figure 3 and Table 1 report the results of a Rietveld structure refinement performed on the higher-statistics CaIrSi_{3} data using the program Synchrotron-Powder, [19] using 1086 reflections from 2.500^{\circ} to 75.000^{\circ}. The reliability factors based on the weighted profile, R_{\rm{up}}, and on the Bragg intensities, R_{\rm{l}}, were 4.30% and 1.98%, respectively. Refinements of the temperature-dependent CaPtSi_{3} data typically produced reliability factors R_{\rm{up}} and R_{\rm{l}} of 4.8%-5.1% and 7.0%-8.5%,

## III III. Superconducting properties

### A. Dc susceptibility and resistivity

Using polycrystalline samples, dc susceptibility measurements were performed with a commercial Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS-XL) down to 1.8 K, and resistivity measurements were performed with a commercial instrument (Quantum Design, PPMS) with a ^{3}He refrigeration insert down to 0.35 K using a conventional four-probe technique. Resistivity in zero field up to 300 K for each compound is exhibited in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The temperature dependence of the resistivity indicates typical metallic behavior with residual resistivity ratios (RRR, \rho_{300K}/\rho_{58}) of \sim4 for CaIrSi_{3} and \sim1.6 for CaPtSi_{3}. The low-temperature resistivity and the

For CaIrSi_{3} the transition temperature is approximately 20% higher than that reported in Ref. [20], attributed to improved sample quality.

The volume fractions estimated from zero-field cooled dc susceptibility data were \sim170% for CalrSi_{3} and \sim100% for CaPtSi_{3}, assuming the samples to be single phase. These large volume fractions are attributed to neglecting demagnetizing effects, but suggest that a majority of each sample was superconducting. The large difference between field-cooled and zero-field-cooled data is likely due to the presence of melt inclusions that can trap magnetic flux. The RRRs and volume fractions indicate that CalrSi_{3} was higher quality than CaPtSi_{3}, consistent with the XRD result.

### Specific heat

Specific heat measurements were performed down to 0.35 K using a relaxation-time-method calorimeter (Quantum Design, PPMS) on a ^{3}He refrigeration insert. The total specific heat for each compound is presented in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), and the electronic specific heat in Figs. 5(c) and 5(d). These were calculated assuming the molar weight of the target phases. Superconductivity in both compounds was suppressed by a magnetic field of 1 T. The normal-state specific heat was found to be invariant under external magnetic fields, so the normal-state electronic specific heat coefficients \gamma_{\rm a} and the lattice specific heat coefficients \beta were deduced from the data in 1 T by a least-squares fit of the total specific heat c_{P} to \gamma_{\rm a}T+\beta T^{3}. This results in \gamma_{\rm a,Ir}=5.8 mJ/mol K^{2} and \beta_{\rm Ir}=0.21 mJ/mol K^{4} for CalFiSi_{3}, and \gamma_{\rm a,Pt}=4.0 mJ/mol K^{2} and \beta_{\rm Pt}=0.20 mJ/mol K^{4} for CaPtSi_{3}. The Debye temperature \Theta_{\rm D} of each compound is estimated from \beta=(12/5)\pi^{4}N_{\rm f.u.}N_{\rm A}k_{\rm B}/\Theta_{\rm D}^{3} as 360 K for CalrSi_{3} and 370 K for CaPtSi_{3}, comparable to those found in ordinary metals. Here N_{\rm f.u.}=5 is the number of atoms per formula unit, N_{\rm A} is Avogadro's number, and k_{\rm B} is Boltzmann's constant. From the specific heat onsets, we define the transition temperatures T_{\rm c}=3.6 K for CalrSi_{3} and 2.3 K for CaPtSi_{3} in zero field, consistent with those from dc susceptibility and resistivity. The specific heat jumps indicate the superconductivity to be bulk in nature.

As presented in Figs. 5(c) and 5(d), the electronic specific heat coefficient \gamma converges to a finite value at low temperatures even in zero field. This indicates that normal-state conduction electrons that do not participate in the superconductivity persist at the Fermi level down to 0 K. However, it cannot be distinguished whether these electrons are contained in CalrSi_{3} (CaPtSi_{3}) or in impurity phases.

A fit of c_{\rm d} to a polynomial approximation to the conventional weak-coupling BCS curve tabulated numerically in Ref. [21] is also displayed in Figs. 5(c) and 5(d). The only two free parameters in this procedure are T_{\rm c} and the superconducting contribution to the electronic specific heat coefficient \gamma_{\rm a}. The data are fit up to a T/T_{\rm c} of just over 70%, and agree well with the BCS curve in this region. The fits result in T_{\rm c} values of 3.44 K for CalrSi_{3} and 2.1 K for CaPtSi_{3}, and \gamma_{\rm a} coefficients of 4.0 mJ/mol K^{2} for CalrSi_{3} and 2.1 mJ/mol K^{2} for CaPtSi_{3}. Entropy conservation at the specific heat jump of each compound gives the same T_{\rm c} [see Figs. 5(c) and 5(d)]. These values of T_{\rm c} correspond to an average of the T_{\rm c} distribution in each sample. The superconducting fraction of each sample

Both zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) dc susceptibility under 1 mT are displayed. The onset temperatures of the superconducting transition are approximately 3.7 K for CalrSi_{3} and 2.3 K for CaPtSi_{3} in both measurements. Strong diamagnetism indicates that the majority of each sample was superconducting.

T_{\rm c} onsets in 0 T are 3.6 K for CalrSi_{3} and 2.3 K for CaPtSi_{3}, and in 0.1 T are 2.5 K for CalrSi_{3} and 1.7 K for CaPtSi_{3}. Solid lines are BCS fits. The shaded regions have the same area on either side of the specific heat jump, corresponding to entropy conservation. The T_{\rm c} values from this procedure match with those from the BCS fits.

  is estimated from \gamma_{\rm s}/\gamma_{\rm n} to be \sim70% in CalrSi_{3} and \sim55% in CaPtSi_{3}, consistent with earlier indications that the CaPtSi_{3} sample contained a greater proportion of impurity phase. The thermodynamic critical field \mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0) is estimated using \mu_{0}H_{\rm c}^{2}(0)/2=-\gamma_{\rm s}T_{\rm c}^{2}/2+\int_{0}^{T_{\rm c}}c_{ \rm cl,s}(T){\rm d}T, where c_{\rm cl,s}(T) is the electronic specific heat in the superconducting phase, to be 0.023 T for CalrSi_{3} and 0.0094 T for CaPtSi_{3}.

### Magnetic phase diagram

Measurements of ac susceptibility in various magnetic fields were performed by a mutual-inductance method (1 \muT, 3011 Hz) down to 0.3 K using a commercial ^{3}He refrigerator (Oxford Instruments, Heliox) equipped with a superconducting magnet. These and the resistivity results are presented in Fig. 6. The ac susceptibility measurements were performed on both warming and cooling with no hysteresis; thus, only the warming results are displayed. Under magnetic fields, ac susceptibility onsets were observed up to 0.27 T for CalrSi_{3} and 0.15 T for CaPtSi_{3}, and resistivity onsets up to 0.6 T for both compounds: several times larger than the thermodynamic critical fields. The large critical fields and nonhysteretic transition temperatures clearly indicate that these compounds are type-II superconductors.

The H-T phase diagrams of CalrSi_{3} and CaPtSi_{3} deduced from the ac susceptibility \chi_{\rm ac}^{\prime} onset, resistivity \rho onset, and specific heat c_{\rho} onset are summarized in Fig. 7. The T_{\rm c} onsets were defined as 5% of full, zero-field diamagnetism in \chi_{\rm ac}^{\prime}, a 5% decrease in \rho, and the onset in c_{P}. We note that for CaPtSi_{3} the transition broadens substantially under magnetic fields. This behavior is correlated with the phase purity of the sample as evidenced by impurity peaks in XRD and the larger residual contribution in the specific heat. Each curve is remarkably linear and is slightly concave upward in low magnetic fields. In neither system do the curves deduced from the \chi_{\rm ac}^{\prime} and \rho onsets coincide, and the discrepancy between them is more prominent for CaPtSi_{3} than for CalrSi_{3}.

Since the H-T curve of CaIrSi_{3} based on \chi_{\rm ac}^{\prime} onset begins to saturate at high fields, \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0) is estimated from the points at 0.3 K as a lower limit and the linear extrapolation to zero temperature as an upper limit: 0.27-0.32 T. Similarly for CaPtSi_{3} it is estimated as 0.15-0.20 T. Approximate Ginzburg-Landau parameters \kappa_{\rm GL}, superconducting coherence lengths \xi(0), and penetration depths \lambda(0) are estimated from the \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2} lower limits with the relations \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0)=\sqrt{2}\kappa_{\rm GL}\mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0), \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0)=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi^{2}(0), and \kappa_{\rm GL}=\lambda(0)/\xi(0), respectively. These results should be treated with caution since they come from multiphase, polycrystalline samples of anisotropic materials, but they provide an essential starting point. The results are summarized in Table 3 with the other physical properties determined in this study.

The zero resistivity temperature matches or exceeds the ac susceptibility onset in magnetic fields. The diamagnetic shielding in \chi_{\rm ac} is fully suppressed below 0.3 T for CalrSi_{3} and 0.2 T for CaPtSi_{3}, whereas \rho onsets were observed up to 0.6 T.

For both compounds the H–T phase lines as extracted from \rho and \chi_{\rm ac}^{\prime} differ. Possible reasons for this difference are discussed in Sec. IV.

  

## IV Discussion and Conclusion

The specific heat results are generally well explained by weak-coupling BCS theory and similar to reports on BaPtSi_{3}.[14] While the agreement with the BCS curve suggests that these superconductors are fully gapped, the specific heat of CalrSi_{3} falls below this curve just above 0.7T_{\rm c}. Although the superconducting transition is broad, this is well outside the transition width. This deviation is suggestive of a departure from a pure s-wave gap structure, as in a multiband or anisotropic-gap scenario, the alternative being an unusual distribution of T_{\rm c} with a significant tail to low temperatures. The apparent full gap strongly suggests that the superconducting pairing is dominantly or exclusively singlet; a triplet component could introduce gap anisotropy.

The experimental values of \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(T) are much smaller than the Pauli-limiting fields \mu_{0}H_{\rm P}(0) of 1.84T_{\rm c} expected in weak-coupling s-wave BCS theory, \sim6.5 T for CalrSi_{3} and \sim4 T for CaPtSi_{3}. Barring large corrections to \mu_{0}H_{\rm P}, the dominant pair-breaking effect in CalrSi_{3} and CaPtSi_{3} would be orbital depairing. This represents a significant difference from the Ce-containing isostructural superconductors CeRhSi_{3}, CeIrSi_{3}, and CeCoGe_{3}, in which heavy-fermion masses strongly suppress orbital depairing to reveal that Pauli-limiting behavior does not set in where expected for a singlet condensate. Pauli pair breaking is strongly suppressed by the presence of a triplet component or a van Vleck-like susceptibility specific to noncentrosymmetric systems.[16, 17, 22, 4] Unless orbital depairing is also suppressed, however, an extremely high \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0) that violates conventional expectations for the Pauli limit, commonly used as a key signature of novel noncentrosymmetric physics, will not be exhibited. This is the case in CalrSi_{3} and CaPtSi_{3}, whose small \gamma values indicate light carrier masses and in which orbital depairing is not suppressed.

In both samples, the \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(T) obtained from the ac susceptibility and resistivity onsets differ substantially. This discrepancy far exceeds the factor of 1.695 associated with \mu_{0}H_{\rm c3} surface superconductivity and thin limit physics, so other effects must be involved. One possible scenario is that anisotropic superconducting parameters, expected given the tetragonal crystal structure, lead to an upper critical field with a strong, narrow peak for one field direction, producing very low volume fractions of robust superconductivity. Another possibility is pressure enhancement of the superconductivity at grain boundaries due to thermal expansion, leading to very thin superconducting surface layers offering a pathway for conductivity but with negligible volume fraction. Finally, the samples could contain networks of more-defected material with almost no volume fraction, in which the mean free path \ell is shorter than the intrinsic \xi_{0}. In such a region, the effective coherence length \xi=(1/\xi_{0}+1/\ell)^{-1} is limited by \ell, increasing \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}\sim 1/\xi^{2}. This would also help to explain a discrepancy with our earlier image furnace-grown CalrSi_{3} samples,[20] which have a significantly lower T_{\rm c} and higher \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0). If \xi in the majority of the samples in the present study is dominated by the change in \xi_{0}, which decreases with decreasing T_{\rm c}, the broadening of the transition in \chi_{\rm xc} can also be coherently explained. The data currently available do not permit determining which of these effects contribute or are dominant. Settling these issues will require single-crystalline samples--anisotropy in the superconducting parameters would be readily apparent when varying the field angle, pressure effects could be studied, and magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities could be doped in to test their effect controllably.

An upward curvature in low fields and striking linearity of \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(T) are observed in both compounds. Such behavior is quite uncommon, but has been observed in multiband superconductors, for example, MgB_{2}.[23] With the full crystal structure determined in CalrSi_{3} and CaPtSi_{3}, band-structure calculations may now be performed to predict the shape of the Fermi surface and whether multiband physics is likely to play a role. This is noteworthy since, to the authors' knowledge, atomic positions have never been published for the Ce analog, although they have been for LaIrSi_{3} and LaRhSi_{3},[24] nonsuperconducting CePtSi_{3},[25] and BaPtSi_{3}.[14]

One somewhat surprising result is that CaIrSi_{3}, CaPtSi_{3}, and previously published BaPtSi_{3}[14] all behave in a very similar fashion. The only clear qualitative differences are in the transition widths and the magnitude of the difference between the T_{\rm c} onsets. Because the spin-orbit coupling strength is expected to increase strongly with atomic number, all three materials are expected to exhibit strong band splitting. Although the Pt-based materials should have somewhat stronger band splitting, its effect on the physical properties will hinge on details of the band structure. In order to determine whether or not noncentrosymmetric physics is operative in these materials, microscopic techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance or \muSR may prove useful.

In conclusion, we reported the crystallographic and superconducting properties of CalrSi_{3} and CaPtSi_{3}. The electronic specific heat coefficients \gamma are a few mJ/mol K^{2} in both CalrSi_{3} and CaPtSi_{3}, values not unusual for metals, indicating that the electron correlations are not strong in these compounds. Their specific heat results suggest that these superconductors are fully gapped. The upper critical fields \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0) are less than a Tesla and consistent with a conventional orbital depairing mechanism. This and the small \gamma values constitute a significant departure from the heavy-fermion Ce-based materials. Because several results have multiple possible interpretations and the role of anisotropy is unclear, single-crystalline samples will be required. Our results on the promising 5d-electron analogs of known Ce-based materials lay the groundwork for studies of the importance of heavy electrons in noncentrosymmetric superconductors.

## Appendix: The new material CaIr_{3}Si_{7}

While optimizing the preparation technique for CaIrSi_{3}, the previously unreported ternary phase CaIr_{3}Si_{7} was discovered, and subsequently reproduced by solid-state reaction of Ca:Ir:Si = 1:1:3 under vacuum in a sealed quartz tube (1100^{\circ}C, 24 hours). This compound crystallizes in the rhombohedral space group R\bar{3}c (No. 167), isotypic to ScRh_{3}Si_{7} and ScIr_{3}Si_{7},[26] and possesses an inversion center. It does not exhibit superconductivity above 1.8 K. We note that thorough investigation of the synthesis of CaPtSi_{3} by a flux method by Takeuchi _et al._ resulted in synthesizing a new centrosymmetric superconductor, Ca_{2}Pt_{3}Si_{5}.[27]

A single-crystalline grain of CaIr_{3}Si_{7}, prepared by melting a mixture of stoichiometry Ca:Ir:Si = 1:1:3 in an image furnace, was separated from excess melt phases using dilute hydrochloric acid. This grain was then characterized at room temperature by single-crystal x-ray diffraction at SPring-8 beam line BL02B1[28] using a large cylindrical image plate detector. A wavelength of 0.351 00 A was used, and data were collected over the index range 0 \leqslanth\leqslant 16, 0 \leqslantk\leqslant 16, and 0 \leqslantl\leqslant 49, and over a range in \theta of 1.83^{\circ} to 26.02^{\circ}. A total of 1816 reflections were collected, all of which were unique and 1697 of which had intensity >2\sigma(I). The structure was solved and refined using SHELXS97 and SHELXL97, respectively;[29] results are summarized in Table 4. Refinement was by a full-matrix least-squares minimization of F^{2}. The final reliability factors R_{1} and wR_{2} were 2.04% and 7.11%, respectively, on peaks with intensity greater than 2\sigma(I), and 2.70% and 7.93%, respectively, on all data.

Since this crystal structure contains a large number of atoms per unit cell in a nontrivial arrangement, it must be broken into

  subunits to be described. As ScRh_{3}Si_{7}, it was portrayed as an array of Sc(Ca)-centered Rh(Ir) octahedra and Si double tetrahedra in which the shared apex was the Si(2) site.[26] However, since the shortest bonds in the material are those between Rh(Ir) and Si, it may be more realistic to visualize the structure in terms of slightly twisted Si-centered Ir_{3}Si_{7} barrels and isolated Ca atoms. A crystal structure based on this scheme is presented in Fig. 8.

21 June 201020121  Fig. 1 displays a SEM image. EDX composition mapping identified two distinct phases in the CaIrSi_{3} sample, with approximate cation ratios Ca:Ir:Si = 1:1.03:2.95, consistent with CaIrSi_{3}, and Ca:Ir:Si = 1:0:2.28. The Ir-free phase did not appear in XRD, suggesting it to be solidified melt without a well-defined crystal structure.

Single-phase CaIrSi_{3} grains of size \sim200 \mum were isolated using dilute hydrochloric acid, then crushed. Homogeneous micron-sized grains were selected using an ethanol suspension, then sealed in a Lindemann glass capillary of internal diameter 0.2 mm. High-resolution synchrotron XRD measurements were performed in transmission mode at the SPring-8 BL02B2 beam line using N_{2} gas-flow temperature control and a large Debye-Scherrer camera with an imaging plate detector [18] which was set up to collect data from 0.010 to 78.68^{\circ} in 2\theta, with a resolution of 0.010^{\circ}. Data were collected at a series of temperatures from 90 to 300 K with exposure times of 5 minutes, and a higher-statistics dataset with a 60-minute exposure time was taken on a different sample at 100 K for structure refinement. The highest peak in the latter dataset had approximately 1,100,000 counts. An incident x-ray wavelength of 0.357 47(1) A was used, calibrated with a CeO_{2} standard.

No technique was found that would result in single-phase CaPtSi_{3} grains, but aqua regia dissolved most impurities, and it was also possible to isolate CaPtSi_{3}-free grains of the remaining impurity phases. Spectra with and without CaPtSi_{3} were collected as for CaIrSi_{3}, using a wavelength of 0.351 190(12) A, but without a high-statistics dataset. By comparing the CaPtSi_{3} and impurity-phase spectra, reflections associated with impurity phases could be deleted, allowing structure refinements for CaPtSi_{3} as shown in Fig. 1. The previously mentioned limitations require that the CaPtSi_{3} XRD results be treated with caution, but they should provide a useful starting point.

Both compounds' lattice parameters increase monotonically with temperature by less than 0.4% over the temperature range probed, as displayed in Fig. 2 for CaIrSi_{3}. In this compound only, a small slope change in the c-axis lattice parameter can be seen at 200 K, and the c-axis position of the Si(2) (Ir-Si layer) site appears to fall by about 0.005 A above this temperature, making the Ir-Si layer slightly flatter. The above changes were reflected in the interatomic distances.

Figure 3 and Table 1 report the results of a Rietveld structure refinement performed on the higher-statistics CaIrSi_{3} data using the program Synchrotron-Powder, [19] using 1086 reflections from 2.500^{\circ} to 75.000^{\circ}. The reliability factors based on the weighted profile, R_{\rm{up}}, and on the Bragg intensities, R_{\rm{l}}, were 4.30% and 1.98%, respectively. Refinements of the temperature-dependent CaPtSi_{3} data typically produced reliability factors R_{\rm{up}} and R_{\rm{l}} of 4.8%-5.1% and 7.0%-8.5%,

The sample contained an impurity phase. The EDX result reveals the bright area to be CaIrSi_{3} and the dark area to have the approximate cation ratio of Ca:Ir:Si = 1:0:2.28.

## III III. Superconducting properties

### A. Dc susceptibility and resistivity

Using polycrystalline samples, dc susceptibility measurements were performed with a commercial Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS-XL) down to 1.8 K, and resistivity measurements were performed with a commercial instrument (Quantum Design, PPMS) with a ^{3}He refrigeration insert down to 0.35 K using a conventional four-probe technique. Resistivity in zero field up to 300 K for each compound is exhibited in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The temperature dependence of the resistivity indicates typical metallic behavior with residual resistivity ratios (RRR, \rho_{300K}/\rho_{58}) of \sim4 for CaIrSi_{3} and \sim1.6 for CaPtSi_{3}. The low-temperature resistivity and the

\begin{table}

For CaIrSi_{3} the transition temperature is approximately 20% higher than that reported in Ref. [20], attributed to improved sample quality.

The volume fractions estimated from zero-field cooled dc susceptibility data were \sim170% for CalrSi_{3} and \sim100% for CaPtSi_{3}, assuming the samples to be single phase. These large volume fractions are attributed to neglecting demagnetizing effects, but suggest that a majority of each sample was superconducting. The large difference between field-cooled and zero-field-cooled data is likely due to the presence of melt inclusions that can trap magnetic flux. The RRRs and volume fractions indicate that CalrSi_{3} was higher quality than CaPtSi_{3}, consistent with the XRD result.

### Specific heat

Specific heat measurements were performed down to 0.35 K using a relaxation-time-method calorimeter (Quantum Design, PPMS) on a ^{3}He refrigeration insert. The total specific heat for each compound is presented in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), and the electronic specific heat in Figs. 5(c) and 5(d). These were calculated assuming the molar weight of the target phases. Superconductivity in both compounds was suppressed by a magnetic field of 1 T. The normal-state specific heat was found to be invariant under external magnetic fields, so the normal-state electronic specific heat coefficients \gamma_{\rm a} and the lattice specific heat coefficients \beta were deduced from the data in 1 T by a least-squares fit of the total specific heat c_{P} to \gamma_{\rm a}T+\beta T^{3}. This results in \gamma_{\rm a,Ir}=5.8 mJ/mol K^{2} and \beta_{\rm Ir}=0.21 mJ/mol K^{4} for CalFiSi_{3}, and \gamma_{\rm a,Pt}=4.0 mJ/mol K^{2} and \beta_{\rm Pt}=0.20 mJ/mol K^{4} for CaPtSi_{3}. The Debye temperature \Theta_{\rm D} of each compound is estimated from \beta=(12/5)\pi^{4}N_{\rm f.u.}N_{\rm A}k_{\rm B}/\Theta_{\rm D}^{3} as 360 K for CalrSi_{3} and 370 K for CaPtSi_{3}, comparable to those found in ordinary metals. Here N_{\rm f.u.}=5 is the number of atoms per formula unit, N_{\rm A} is Avogadro's number, and k_{\rm B} is Boltzmann's constant. From the specific heat onsets, we define the transition temperatures T_{\rm c}=3.6 K for CalrSi_{3} and 2.3 K for CaPtSi_{3} in zero field, consistent with those from dc susceptibility and resistivity. The specific heat jumps indicate the superconductivity to be bulk in nature.

As presented in Figs. 5(c) and 5(d), the electronic specific heat coefficient \gamma converges to a finite value at low temperatures even in zero field. This indicates that normal-state conduction electrons that do not participate in the superconductivity persist at the Fermi level down to 0 K. However, it cannot be distinguished whether these electrons are contained in CalrSi_{3} (CaPtSi_{3}) or in impurity phases.

A fit of c_{\rm d} to a polynomial approximation to the conventional weak-coupling BCS curve tabulated numerically in Ref. [21] is also displayed in Figs. 5(c) and 5(d). The only two free parameters in this procedure are T_{\rm c} and the superconducting contribution to the electronic specific heat coefficient \gamma_{\rm a}. The data are fit up to a T/T_{\rm c} of just over 70%, and agree well with the BCS curve in this region. The fits result in T_{\rm c} values of 3.44 K for CalrSi_{3} and 2.1 K for CaPtSi_{3}, and \gamma_{\rm a} coefficients of 4.0 mJ/mol K^{2} for CalrSi_{3} and 2.1 mJ/mol K^{2} for CaPtSi_{3}. Entropy conservation at the specific heat jump of each compound gives the same T_{\rm c} [see Figs. 5(c) and 5(d)]. These values of T_{\rm c} correspond to an average of the T_{\rm c} distribution in each sample. The superconducting fraction of each sample

Both zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) dc susceptibility under 1 mT are displayed. The onset temperatures of the superconducting transition are approximately 3.7 K for CalrSi_{3} and 2.3 K for CaPtSi_{3} in both measurements. Strong diamagnetism indicates that the majority of each sample was superconducting.

T_{\rm c} onsets in 0 T are 3.6 K for CalrSi_{3} and 2.3 K for CaPtSi_{3}, and in 0.1 T are 2.5 K for CalrSi_{3} and 1.7 K for CaPtSi_{3}. Solid lines are BCS fits. The shaded regions have the same area on either side of the specific heat jump, corresponding to entropy conservation. The T_{\rm c} values from this procedure match with those from the BCS fits.

  is estimated from \gamma_{\rm s}/\gamma_{\rm n} to be \sim70% in CalrSi_{3} and \sim55% in CaPtSi_{3}, consistent with earlier indications that the CaPtSi_{3} sample contained a greater proportion of impurity phase. The thermodynamic critical field \mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0) is estimated using \mu_{0}H_{\rm c}^{2}(0)/2=-\gamma_{\rm s}T_{\rm c}^{2}/2+\int_{0}^{T_{\rm c}}c_{ \rm cl,s}(T){\rm d}T, where c_{\rm cl,s}(T) is the electronic specific heat in the superconducting phase, to be 0.023 T for CalrSi_{3} and 0.0094 T for CaPtSi_{3}.

### Magnetic phase diagram

Measurements of ac susceptibility in various magnetic fields were performed by a mutual-inductance method (1 \muT, 3011 Hz) down to 0.3 K using a commercial ^{3}He refrigerator (Oxford Instruments, Heliox) equipped with a superconducting magnet. These and the resistivity results are presented in Fig. 6. The ac susceptibility measurements were performed on both warming and cooling with no hysteresis; thus, only the warming results are displayed. Under magnetic fields, ac susceptibility onsets were observed up to 0.27 T for CalrSi_{3} and 0.15 T for CaPtSi_{3}, and resistivity onsets up to 0.6 T for both compounds: several times larger than the thermodynamic critical fields. The large critical fields and nonhysteretic transition temperatures clearly indicate that these compounds are type-II superconductors.

The H-T phase diagrams of CalrSi_{3} and CaPtSi_{3} deduced from the ac susceptibility \chi_{\rm ac}^{\prime} onset, resistivity \rho onset, and specific heat c_{\rho} onset are summarized in Fig. 7. The T_{\rm c} onsets were defined as 5% of full, zero-field diamagnetism in \chi_{\rm ac}^{\prime}, a 5% decrease in \rho, and the onset in c_{P}. We note that for CaPtSi_{3} the transition broadens substantially under magnetic fields. This behavior is correlated with the phase purity of the sample as evidenced by impurity peaks in XRD and the larger residual contribution in the specific heat. Each curve is remarkably linear and is slightly concave upward in low magnetic fields. In neither system do the curves deduced from the \chi_{\rm ac}^{\prime} and \rho onsets coincide, and the discrepancy between them is more prominent for CaPtSi_{3} than for CalrSi_{3}.

Since the H-T curve of CaIrSi_{3} based on \chi_{\rm ac}^{\prime} onset begins to saturate at high fields, \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0) is estimated from the points at 0.3 K as a lower limit and the linear extrapolation to zero temperature as an upper limit: 0.27-0.32 T. Similarly for CaPtSi_{3} it is estimated as 0.15-0.20 T. Approximate Ginzburg-Landau parameters \kappa_{\rm GL}, superconducting coherence lengths \xi(0), and penetration depths \lambda(0) are estimated from the \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2} lower limits with the relations \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0)=\sqrt{2}\kappa_{\rm GL}\mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0), \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0)=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi^{2}(0), and \kappa_{\rm GL}=\lambda(0)/\xi(0), respectively. These results should be treated with caution since they come from multiphase, polycrystalline samples of anisotropic materials, but they provide an essential starting point. The results are summarized in Table 3 with the other physical properties determined in this study.

Figure 6: (Color online) Temperature dependence of ac susceptibility (the imaginary part \chi_{\rm ac}^{\prime} and the real part \chi_{\rm ac}^{\prime}) and resistivity \rho of CalrSi_{3} and CaPtSi_{3} in selected magnetic fields. The zero resistivity temperature matches or exceeds the ac susceptibility onset in magnetic fields. The diamagnetic shielding in \chi_{\rm ac} is fully suppressed below 0.3 T for CalrSi_{3} and 0.2 T for CaPtSi_{3}, whereas \rho onsets were observed up to 0.6 T.

Figure 7: (Color online) H–T phase diagram of CalrSi_{3} and CaPtSi_{3}. Points represent the onset temperatures in \chi_{\rm ac}^{\prime}, \rho, and c_{P}, as defined in the text. For both compounds the H–T phase lines as extracted from \rho and \chi_{\rm ac}^{\prime} differ. Possible reasons for this difference are discussed in Sec. IV.

  

## IV Discussion and Conclusion

The specific heat results are generally well explained by weak-coupling BCS theory and similar to reports on BaPtSi_{3}.[14] While the agreement with the BCS curve suggests that these superconductors are fully gapped, the specific heat of CalrSi_{3} falls below this curve just above 0.7T_{\rm c}. Although the superconducting transition is broad, this is well outside the transition width. This deviation is suggestive of a departure from a pure s-wave gap structure, as in a multiband or anisotropic-gap scenario, the alternative being an unusual distribution of T_{\rm c} with a significant tail to low temperatures. The apparent full gap strongly suggests that the superconducting pairing is dominantly or exclusively singlet; a triplet component could introduce gap anisotropy.

The experimental values of \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(T) are much smaller than the Pauli-limiting fields \mu_{0}H_{\rm P}(0) of 1.84T_{\rm c} expected in weak-coupling s-wave BCS theory, \sim6.5 T for CalrSi_{3} and \sim4 T for CaPtSi_{3}. Barring large corrections to \mu_{0}H_{\rm P}, the dominant pair-breaking effect in CalrSi_{3} and CaPtSi_{3} would be orbital depairing. This represents a significant difference from the Ce-containing isostructural superconductors CeRhSi_{3}, CeIrSi_{3}, and CeCoGe_{3}, in which heavy-fermion masses strongly suppress orbital depairing to reveal that Pauli-limiting behavior does not set in where expected for a singlet condensate. Pauli pair breaking is strongly suppressed by the presence of a triplet component or a van Vleck-like susceptibility specific to noncentrosymmetric systems.[16, 17, 22, 4] Unless orbital depairing is also suppressed, however, an extremely high \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0) that violates conventional expectations for the Pauli limit, commonly used as a key signature of novel noncentrosymmetric physics, will not be exhibited. This is the case in CalrSi_{3} and CaPtSi_{3}, whose small \gamma values indicate light carrier masses and in which orbital depairing is not suppressed.

In both samples, the \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(T) obtained from the ac susceptibility and resistivity onsets differ substantially. This discrepancy far exceeds the factor of 1.695 associated with \mu_{0}H_{\rm c3} surface superconductivity and thin limit physics, so other effects must be involved. One possible scenario is that anisotropic superconducting parameters, expected given the tetragonal crystal structure, lead to an upper critical field with a strong, narrow peak for one field direction, producing very low volume fractions of robust superconductivity. Another possibility is pressure enhancement of the superconductivity at grain boundaries due to thermal expansion, leading to very thin superconducting surface layers offering a pathway for conductivity but with negligible volume fraction. Finally, the samples could contain networks of more-defected material with almost no volume fraction, in which the mean free path \ell is shorter than the intrinsic \xi_{0}. In such a region, the effective coherence length \xi=(1/\xi_{0}+1/\ell)^{-1} is limited by \ell, increasing \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}\sim 1/\xi^{2}. This would also help to explain a discrepancy with our earlier image furnace-grown CalrSi_{3} samples,[20] which have a significantly lower T_{\rm c} and higher \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0). If \xi in the majority of the samples in the present study is dominated by the change in \xi_{0}, which decreases with decreasing T_{\rm c}, the broadening of the transition in \chi_{\rm xc} can also be coherently explained. The data currently available do not permit determining which of these effects contribute or are dominant. Settling these issues will require single-crystalline samples--anisotropy in the superconducting parameters would be readily apparent when varying the field angle, pressure effects could be studied, and magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities could be doped in to test their effect controllably.

An upward curvature in low fields and striking linearity of \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(T) are observed in both compounds. Such behavior is quite uncommon, but has been observed in multiband superconductors, for example, MgB_{2}.[23] With the full crystal structure determined in CalrSi_{3} and CaPtSi_{3}, band-structure calculations may now be performed to predict the shape of the Fermi surface and whether multiband physics is likely to play a role. This is noteworthy since, to the authors' knowledge, atomic positions have never been published for the Ce analog, although they have been for LaIrSi_{3} and LaRhSi_{3},[24] nonsuperconducting CePtSi_{3},[25] and BaPtSi_{3}.[14]

One somewhat surprising result is that CaIrSi_{3}, CaPtSi_{3}, and previously published BaPtSi_{3}[14] all behave in a very similar fashion. The only clear qualitative differences are in the transition widths and the magnitude of the difference between the T_{\rm c} onsets. Because the spin-orbit coupling strength is expected to increase strongly with atomic number, all three materials are expected to exhibit strong band splitting. Although the Pt-based materials should have somewhat stronger band splitting, its effect on the physical properties will hinge on details of the band structure. In order to determine whether or not noncentrosymmetric physics is operative in these materials, microscopic techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance or \muSR may prove useful.

In conclusion, we reported the crystallographic and superconducting properties of CalrSi_{3} and CaPtSi_{3}. The electronic specific heat coefficients \gamma are a few mJ/mol K^{2} in both CalrSi_{3} and CaPtSi_{3}, values not unusual for metals, indicating that the electron correlations are not strong in these compounds. Their specific heat results suggest that these superconductors are fully gapped. The upper critical fields \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0) are less than a Tesla and consistent with a conventional orbital depairing mechanism. This and the small \gamma values constitute a significant departure from the heavy-fermion Ce-based materials. Because several results have multiple possible interpretations and the role of anisotropy is unclear, single-crystalline samples will be required. Our results on the promising 5d-electron analogs of known Ce-based materials lay the groundwork for studies of the importance of heavy electrons in noncentrosymmetric superconductors.

## Appendix: The new material CaIr_{3}Si_{7}

While optimizing the preparation technique for CaIrSi_{3}, the previously unreported ternary phase CaIr_{3}Si_{7} was discovered, and subsequently reproduced by solid-state reaction of Ca:Ir:Si = 1:1:3 under vacuum in a sealed quartz tube (1100^{\circ}C, 24 hours). This compound crystallizes in the rhombohedral space group R\bar{3}c (No. 167), isotypic to ScRh_{3}Si_{7} and ScIr_{3}Si_{7},[26] and possesses an inversion center. It does not exhibit superconductivity above 1.8 K. We note that thorough investigation of the synthesis of CaPtSi_{3} by a flux method by Takeuchi _et al._ resulted in synthesizing a new centrosymmetric superconductor, Ca_{2}Pt_{3}Si_{5}.[27]

A single-crystalline grain of CaIr_{3}Si_{7}, prepared by melting a mixture of stoichiometry Ca:Ir:Si = 1:1:3 in an image furnace, was separated from excess melt phases using dilute hydrochloric acid. This grain was then characterized at room temperature by single-crystal x-ray diffraction at SPring-8 beam line BL02B1[28] using a large cylindrical image plate detector. A wavelength of 0.351 00 A was used, and data were collected over the index range 0 \leqslanth\leqslant 16, 0 \leqslantk\leqslant 16, and 0 \leqslantl\leqslant 49, and over a range in \theta of 1.83^{\circ} to 26.02^{\circ}. A total of 1816 reflections were collected, all of which were unique and 1697 of which had intensity >2\sigma(I). The structure was solved and refined using SHELXS97 and SHELXL97, respectively;[29] results are summarized in Table 4. Refinement was by a full-matrix least-squares minimization of F^{2}. The final reliability factors R_{1} and wR_{2} were 2.04% and 7.11%, respectively, on peaks with intensity greater than 2\sigma(I), and 2.70% and 7.93%, respectively, on all data.

Since this crystal structure contains a large number of atoms per unit cell in a nontrivial arrangement, it must be broken into

  subunits to be described. As ScRh_{3}Si_{7}, it was portrayed as an array of Sc(Ca)-centered Rh(Ir) octahedra and Si double tetrahedra in which the shared apex was the Si(2) site.[26] However, since the shortest bonds in the material are those between Rh(Ir) and Si, it may be more realistic to visualize the structure in terms of slightly twisted Si-centered Ir_{3}Si_{7} barrels and isolated Ca atoms. A crystal structure based on this scheme is presented in Fig. 8.
