###### Abstract

Both in-plane (\(r_{b}\)) and out-of-plane (\(r_{c}\)) resistivity measurements have been carried out on (Bi1.64Pb0.36)Sr2(Ca0.79Y0.21)Cu2O8+ _single crystals with magnetic field applied along the _c_-axis direction. Studying the temperature dependence of the resistivity ratio _r__ab_/_r__c_, we identify at high temperature a pancake phase with the signature proposed by Koshelev. At lower temperature, we observe a thermally activated behavior which can be interpreted easily in the framework of a three-dimensional vortex loops model. We found that the high-temperature limit of the thermally activated behavior corresponds to the low-temperature limit of the Koshelev's prediction. This latter is also characterized by an onset of the in-plane resistivity drop. Consequently, our data suggest that this line is a dimensional crossover which describes the decoupling of the liquid state into a decoupled pancake state.

## I Introduction

It is generally well established that the sharp drop of resistivity observed in the mixed state is the result of a first order transition of the vortex lattice. It may correspond either to a melting transition [1, 2, 3, 4] or to a decoupling one [5]. However, the first order transition is very sensitive to the state of disorder [6, 7, 8] and should lead to a second order transition when increasing the disorder. In this case, a drop of resistivity should correspond to a second order transition or a continuous crossover in the vortex diagram. On the other hand, if one assumes this drop to be a change of dimensionality of the vortices (decoupling transition or crossover), the three-dimensional (3D) and 2D behaviors should be observable. Moreover, in a "field/temperature" diagram, this crossover line should decrease as the anisotropy increases [9, 10, 11].

In a highly anisotropic compounds such as Bi-2212, the theoretical analysis in terms of activation energies at low temperature revealed that the field dependence of these energies was proportional to \((B^{-1/2})\)[12, 13, 14, 15, 16] in the case of 3D vortices. Increasing the temperature, the application of these models should not be anymore valid, due to the pancakes decoupling, driving the 3D vortex lattice into a 2D system at high temperature [17, 18]. Above this decoupling line, the system can be regarded as sets of 2D vortices independent from a layer to another. On these considerations, Koshelev [18] proposed a description of this 2D vortex state where the _c_-axis resistivity \(r_{c}\) should be related to the measured \(r_{b}\) . In 1992, Busch _et al._[19] have measured in Bi-2212 the in and out of plane resistivities in a single crystal by a six-terminal method. But this method made several approximations which are not always fulfilled in the present case, as we have shown by a more exact numerical calculation [20].

Consequently, in order to describe the dimensionality of the vortices on the whole (_B_,_T_) phase diagram, several theoretical approach are needed since none of them is able to describe all the underlying mechanisms of dissipation. The aim of this paper is to identify, on the same sample and by a different experimental technique, the 3D and 2D characters of the vortices and analyze them using various models and determine the limits of validity of them.

## II Experiment

The single crystals of (Bi1.64Pb0.36)Sr2(Ca0.79Y0.21)Cu2O8+ \(d\) are grown by a self-flux method. The details of the growth are reported elsewhere [21, 22]. The results presented here are typical of all the samples of the same batch. The dimensions of the crystal that we have chosen to present here are 960 _m_m x 820 _m_m \(\times\) 20 _m_m with the lower dimension parallel to the _c_-axis direction. We have evaporated six "silver pads" as described in Fig. 1. These pads cross the whole width of the crystals. Two of them on the top face, two others on the bottom face and one "silver pad" on each _ac_ face. With this simple contacts configuration, we measured the in-plane \(r_{b}\) and the out-of-plane \(r_{c}\) resistivities on the same crystal. Indeed, the measurement of the \(r_{c}\) resistivity needs to apply the current along the _c_-axis direction and measure the voltage drop parallel to it. This simple contacts configuration leads to a good estimate of \(r_{c}\), as discussed by Hardy _et al._[23, 20] for Bi-2212 single crystals. On the other hand, for the in-plane resistivity measurement, the current is applied within the _ab_ plane, i.e., between the two _ac_ planes, and the voltage drop is measured with either the two contacts on the top face or the two others of the bottom face. On Fig. 1, we report the two different contacts configurations used in this study. All the measurements were performed in the linear regime (_I_ = 1 mA) , in which the critical current was checked to be zero. This rules out any possible effect of geometrical barriers, previously

  reported in similar samples in the solid phase at low magnetic field.[24]

In order to reduce the contact resistances, we annealed the sample at \(T\) = 400 \({}^{\circ}\)C during ten minutes. After annealing, the contact resistances are close to 11\(\Omega\).

The resistivity measurements were performed by a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS model 6000 from quantum design) with decreasing temperature and an applied magnetic field up to 5 T. The ac susceptibility measurements were performed by a SQUID susceptometry with a fixed magnetic field and temperature and with a frequency varying from 10\({}^{-1}\) to 10\({}^{3}\) Hz.

## III III. Results and Discussion

In Fig. 2, we report the in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity measurements under magnetic field parallel to the \(c\) axis. The critical temperature is _T\({}_{c}\)_ = 86 K with a transition width \(\Delta\)_T\({}_{c}\)_ ~ 2 K as determined by a SQUID dc magnetization measurement under 1 G. Moreover, at room temperature, _phab_ = 300 \(\mu\Omega\) cm and _r\({}_{c}\)_ = 0.25 \(\Omega\) cm. These values are in good agreement with previous reports.[23, 25, 26, 27]

In the normal state, the in-plane resistivity presents a linear temperature dependence while the _c_-axis resistivity shows a '-semiconductinglike' behavior. On the other hand, in the superconducting state, the _r\({}_{ab}\)_ curves present two different behaviors: at higher field, the _r\({}_{ab}\)_ resistivity decreases rather smoothly with the temperature and no anomaly is observed while at lower field, a shoulder is observed in the low temperature end of the _r\({}_{ab}\)_ curves. For the _c_-axis resistivity measurements, the same characteristic curves can be seen but the shoulder is less pronounced than in the in-plane resistivity case. Consequently, the in-plane and out-of-plane resistivities present roughly a similar temperature dependence.

From a theoretical point of view, one expects that for field larger than the crossover field _B\({}_{\rm cr}\)_ = _ph_0/(_gd_)2 = 0.1 T and temperature larger than the decoupling temperature _T\({}_{\rm dec}\)_, the vortex system can be analyzed as a set of independent two-dimensional vortex lattice in the layers.[17] Here _ph_0 is the flux quantum, \(g\) is the anisotropy ratio, and \(d\) is half the interlayer spacing. The in-plane dissipation is then due to the thermally activated motion of mobile pancake vortices. The _c_-axis conductivity is of Josephson origin and is caused by the phase slips between neighboring pancakes in adjacent CuO\({}_{2}\) layers. In the Koshelev model,[18] describing the decoupled 2D pancakes phase, the author finds a relation between _r\({}_{c}\)_ and _r\({}_{ab}\)_. Koshelev supposes that the phase slips are caused by the diffusive motion of the small amount of pancake vortices independently in the different layers. In order to verify the theoretical Koshelev's prediction, we have plotted on Fig. 3 the temperature dependence of the _r\({}_{ab}\)_/_r\({}_{c}\)_(_T_,_B_) ratio for a \(B\) = 0.2 T magnetic field. In Fig. 4, for all the magnetic field between \(B\) = 0 and \(B\) = 5 T, the temperature dependence of the _r\({}_{ab}\)_/_r\({}_{c}\)_(_T_,_B_) ratio are illustrated. The curves are then fitted using the temperature dependence _r\({}_{ab}\)_/_r\({}_{c}\)_(_T_,_B_) = _A_(_B_)[(1 - _T/T_{c})^{2}\rho_{{}_{\rm cr}}^{2}T^{2}\)_ as proposed by Koshelev.[18] In this expression, \(A\) is the fitting parameter and _r\({}_{ca}\)_ is the nor

The solid line (a) corresponds to the fit expression proposed by Koshelev. The dash-dotted line represents the low temperature limit of the 2D model proposed by Koshelev.

  mal state _c_-axis resistivity. We have used the phenomenological expression proposed by Yan _et al._28 where \(\rho_{ex}(T)\) = \(\rho_{0}\) + _bT_ + (_cT_)exp(D/_T_) with \(\rho_{0}\)  0.20 O \(\Omega\) cm, \(b\)  1.43 x 10-4 O \(\Omega\) cm K-1, \(c\)  1.45 O \(\Omega\) cm K, \(\Delta\) = 233.9 K. Let us note the magnetic field dependence of the fitting parameter \(A\) (_B_). According to the Koshelev's model, the fitting parameter should be proportional to the inverse of the magnetic field: \(A\) (_B_)  1/_B_.

In Figs. 3(a) and 4, we observe that the theoretical expression described above fit perfectly our data. On these figures, the fits are represented by the solid lines. The magnetic field dependence of the fitting parameter is also in perfect agreement with the theory as illustrated in the inset of the Fig. 4 where the solid line corresponds to a _B_\({}^{- 1}\) dependence. Nevertheless, we can observe that our data are not well fitted at low temperature as shown in Fig. 3(a). Consequently, in the high-temperature part of the \(\rho_{ab}(T,B)\) curves, the "vortex matter" seems to correspond with a decoupled pancakes. Recently, Chung _et al._29 identified this 2D vortex state using the Koshelev expression. For lower magnetic field, the low-temperature limit of the model (this limit is marked by a dash-dotted line on Fig. 3 for \(B\) = 0.2 T) corresponds roughly to the temperature drop of \(\rho_{ab}\) described above by a shoulder as shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 7, we plotted this limit by a solid line. This latter represents a decoupling crossover.

It has been observed that the low-temperature part of the resistivity curves is consistent with a thermally activated dissipation mechanism. [16, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 8  tained experimental line are different, suggesting that the common line of the two above models, experimentally obtained, represents a decoupling crossover inside the liquid phase. This is consistent with Baziljevich _et al._[34] who shown, in Pb-doped Bi-2212 single crystal, that the second peak line was not due to a 3D-2D decoupling.

In order to verify the validity of our resistivity measurements of \(\rho_{ab}\), we have performed ac susceptibility measurements. With this method, only the in plane component of the resistivity is involved.[40] In order to restrict the measurement to linear regime, we only considered field above \(B\!=\!1\) T where \(J_{c}\) is negligeable. In Fig. 6, we have plotted the frequency dependence of the real \(\chi^{\prime}\) [Fig. 6(a)] and imaginary \(\chi^{\prime\prime}\) [Fig. 6(b)] part of the susceptibility for \(B\!=\!2\) T and for various temperatures between \(T\!=\!18\) and \(T\!=\!32\) K. At the maximum of \(\chi^{\prime\prime}\), the characteristic time of the vortex response is inversely proportional to the frequency (skin effect), i.e., \(\tau_{\infty}f_{\rm max}^{-1}\).[40] The relation between this characteristic time and the resistivity is given by \(\tau\!=\!0.1815(c\,\mu_{0}\sqrt[\alpha]{a}\,b/\pi/p)\) where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the dimensions of the sample. Consequently, at the maximum of \(\chi^{\prime\prime}\), the frequency is proportional to the resistivity and, from the ac susceptibility measurements, we can extract the temperature dependence of the in plane resistivity.[41] The obtained results are plotted in Fig. 5. First, the data obtained by ac susceptibility measurements merge perfectly with those obtained by resistivity ones, confirming the validity of our measurements. For lower temperatures, the temperature dependence of the activation energy deviates from the linearity. Though this remark can be of first importance to understand the low temperature behavior of the vortices, it is out of the scope of the present paper which deals mainly with the 3D to 2D behavior.

In Fig. 7, we have reported the \((B,T)\) phase diagram. In the high magnetic field/high temperature range, i.e., above the solid line, the dissipation is due to a small amount of pancake vortices. In this region, the 2D Koshelev's model is valid. Below this solid line, the vortices present a tridimensional character and the dissipation is due to the movement of 3D vortex loops vortex. Therefore, the solid line represents the crossover from a 3D vortex loops liquid to a 2D decoupled pancake phase.

In conclusion, we have measured, on the same single crystal, both the in-plane and the out-of-plane resistivities. From these data, we have identified a crossover line characterized by the temperature drop (shoulder) of the in-plane resistivity. This line represents the decoupling from a 3D vortex loops liquid state to a 2D decoupled pancake phase.
