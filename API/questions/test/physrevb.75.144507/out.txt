A relative weight of the intraband scattering is estimated from the fitting of the field dependence of the PC spectra to a simple empirical model. Significant changes in the relative weighting of the scattering are found in the case of C doping because of the increased scattering particularly in the \pi band. The Al doping does not change the relative weight of the scatterings within the bands, and the samples seem to stay in the clean limit.

## II Experiment

Polycrystalline samples Mg0.0Al0.1B2 and Mg0.0Al0.2B2 with T_{c}=30.5 and 23.5 K, respectively, have been prepared by a two-step synthesis at high temperatures.[18] The carbon substituted samples Mg(B(1(1-y)C)2, with y = 0.055, 0.065, and 0.1 and with corresponding transition temperatures T_{c}=33, 28, and 22 K, were synthesized in the form of pellets following the procedure described in Ref. [18] from magnesium lumps and B4C powder. In the case of y=0.021 and 0.038, we have worked with the wire segments exhibiting T_{c} =37.5, and 36.2 K, respectively.[20] For the undoped MgB2, two kinds of samples have been used: very clean MgB2 wires (the residual resistivity of 0.5 \mu\Omega cm) with T_{c}=39 K and the small upper critical magnetic fields H_{c21c}= 3 T,[20] compatible with the clean limit theoretical calculations,[21] and the polycrystalline pellets prepared from boron and magnesium powder[4] also with T_{c}=39 K but with a higher upper critical field H_{c21c}= 5 T in a dirty limit.

The point-contact measurements have been performed in the way described previously.[12] The applied magnetic field was always oriented perpendicular to the sample surface and parallel with the tip having the point-contact area in the vortex state. The point-contact spectrum (the differential conductance as a function of applied voltage) has been theoretically described by the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) theory[22] using as input parameters the energy gap \Delta, the parameter z (measure for the strength of the interface barrier), and the parameter \Gamma for the spectral broadening.[23] In the case of two-gap superconductor, the voltage-dependent normalized point-contact conductance can be expressed as a weighted sum of two partial conductances g_{\sigma(\pi)}, those from the quasi-two-dimensional \sigma band (with a large gap \Delta_{\sigma}) and those from the three-dimensional \pi band (with a small gap \Delta_{\pi}), as follows:

\[G/G_{a}(V)=\alpha g_{\pi}+(1-\alpha)g_{\sigma}.\] (1)

The weight factor \alpha for the \pi-band contribution can vary from 0.6 for the point-contact current strictly in the MgB2 ab plane to 0.99 in the _c_-axis direction.[24] The two-band BTK model does not include the effect of interband scattering and is thus limited to a weak scattering between the bands. Recently, Dolgov _et al.[25]_ have shown that an increased interband scattering mixing the pairs in the two bands (the states appear in the \sigma band at the energy range of the \pi-band gap) will broaden the resulting total density of states. In this case also, the point-contact spectrum will get broadened. Nevertheless, fitting to the simple two-band BTK model can still provide a good estimate of the size of the gaps if they are resolved in the measured spectrum.

## III Results and Discussion

A large number of the point-contact measurements have been performed on the investigated samples of pure MgB2 and both substituted series. Since the C doping leads the MgB2 samples deeply into the dirty limit (with an increase of H_{c2} despite a decreased T_{c}), we have chosen the undoped MgB2 sample being already in a dirty limit for a comparison with the C-doped samples in the discussion about the effect of magnetic field. On the other hand, the Al doping seems to keep the clean limit conditions. Thus, we have chosen the pure MgB2 wire as a reference in the studies of the magnetic-field effects. By trial and error, we looked for the spectra showing both gaps in polycrystalline specimens. For more detailed studies, we chose the junctions revealing the spectra with a low spectral broadening \Gamma, i.e., with an intensive signal in the normalized PC conductance. As a result, we succeeded in obtaining many point-contact spectra with well resolved two superconducting gaps directly visible in the raw data for all of the studied substitutions except for the highest dopings, namely, Mg0.8Al0.2B2 and Mg(B0.9C0.1)2. As shown in the following, the application of magnetic field can help resolve the two gaps directly also in these cases. Figure 1 displays the representative spectra of the Al-doped series. The upper curves in the panels are the spectra in zero magnetic field, and the others display an effect of the field. Figure 2 shows in the same way the results for the C-doped

  MgB_{2}. The experimental data are presented by the full lines, while the fits to the two-gap formula are indicated by the open circles. The fitting formula for the spectra in magnetic field is explained below. All shown PC spectra have been normalized to the spectra measured in the normal state at a temperature above T_{c}.

The retention of two gaps for all dopings apart from the highest substitution is evident already at zero magnetic field. For the highest dopings (always with a larger spectral broadening, G = 0.2D), the spectra reveal only one pair of peaks without an apparent shoulder at the expected position of the second gap. The size of the apparent gap is well indicated by the peak position, which is about 2 meV for MgB0.8Al0.2B_{2} and 1.6 meV for Mg(B0.9C0.1)2. However, this size is too small to explain the superconductivity with the respective T_{c}'s equal to 23.5 and 22 K within the single-gap BCS scenario. The presented data document a strong effect of magnetic field on the \pi-band contribution to the spectrum. The zero-field spectrum of the clean undoped MgB_{2} measured on the wire sample (bottom panel in Fig. 1) reveals a clear two-gap structure. At small fields, the peak corresponding to the small gap D_{\pi} is very rapidly suppressed and only the peak related to the large gap D_{\sigma} is apparently visible above 1 T. At 10% of Al doping, the zero-field spectra also show both gaps, but the large one is now revealed more as a pronounced shoulder. Again at a small magnetic field, the \pi-band-gap peak is rapidly suppressed but its signature is still distinguishable at 0.5 T. At higher fields, the signatures of both gaps are not resolvable due to an interference of the related peaks placed at closed positions. The resulting maximum is located in the intermediate position between them. At the highest doping (20% Al), such an interference of even closer gaps is graduated; so, already at zero magnetic field one can see only one pair of peaks at the position of the small gap (it always has much higher weight at zero field) and a minor shoulder at the voltage of the large one. In the increasing field, the peak position, which is about 2 mV in zero field, is shifted toward 3 mV at 1 T. In the case of a single-gap superconductor, the application of magnetic field can only lead to a shrinkage of the distance between the peak positions in the PC spectrum. This is a simple consequence of the introduction of the vortices and magnetic pair breaking.[26] The shift of the peak of the PC spectra to higher voltages is then due to an interplay between the two gaps. The dominance of the D_{\pi} peak at zero field is suppressed in increasing magnetic field and D_{\sigma} contributes more.

In Fig. 2, the existence of both gaps is evidenced in a similar way for the 6.5% and 10% carbon dopings. For example, in the upper panel, the spectrum at \mu_{0}H=0.5 T shows that the \pi-band-gap peak at 1.6 mV is already partially suppressed and the large-gap shoulder clearly appears near 3 mV. We remark that for the 10% C-doped MgB_{2}, the existence of the large gap has also been shown in our previous paper by PC spectroscopy[12] and also by the specific-heat measurements on the samples from the same batch as used here.[27]

The overall statistics of the energy gaps obtained from fitting of the zero-field PC spectra to the two-band BTK formula is shown in Fig. 3 for each C and Al concentration. The left coordinate indicates the transition temperature of the junctions, while the right one counts the number of junctions with the same size of the gaps. The energy width of a particular count indicates the fitting uncertainty. All the samples, the undoped MgB_{2} as well as the Al- and C-doped materials,

  reveal a certain distribution of the small and large gaps, but the two gaps are well distinguishable in the histogram and no overlap of D_a_ and D_m_ is observed. Already from this figure, a general tendency is evident, namely, that the reduction of the large gap is proportional to the decreasing transition temperature. On the other hand, the changes in the small gap are proportionally smaller.

Figure 4 summarizes the energy gaps as a function of _T__c_'s. The points (open squares for Al dopings and solid circles for C ones) are positioned at the averaged energies of the gap distributions in Fig. 3, and the error bars represent the standard deviations. The large gap D_a_ is essentially decreased linearly with the corresponding _T__c_'s. The behavior of D_a_'s is more complicated. For both kinds of substitution, the gap is almost unchanged at smaller dopings. In the case of C-doped MgB2, it clearly holds down to T_{c} = 33 K. In the case of (Mg,Al)B2, D_m_ of the 10% Al-doped sample seems to even slightly increase, but for the highest dopings, D_m_ decreases in both doping cases. The solid lines in Fig. 4 are calculations of Kortus _et al._10 for the case of a pure band-filling effect and no interband scattering. Although the constant D_a_ is not reproduced, the T_{c} dependence of D's for carbon doping can be broadly described indicating smaller interband scattering. The dashed lines show the calculations of Kortus _et al._ including the interband scattering with the rate g_JB_ = 1000x cm-1 (or 2000y cm-1). As can be seen, the evolution of the gaps in the Al-doped samples cannot be accounted for without an interband scattering, although its rate is certainly smaller than in the presented calculations. A proper weighting of both effects will naturally explain the constant value of the _p_-band gap and the expected position of gaps merging in both doping cases.

Recently, similar results on the superconducting energy gaps have been obtained with the Al-doped single crystals by Klein _et al._28 exploring the specific heat as well as the PC spectroscopy measurements. Those data also show a tendency of approaching of the two gaps with their possible merging in the Al-doped samples with T_{c} below 10-15 K. It is worth noticing that our previous results28 and those presented here show neither a decrease of the large gap below the canonical BCS value16 nor a drop of D_m_ below 1 meV (Ref. [17]) for the Al-doped MgB2 with _T__c_'s below 30 K found earlier.

In contrast with the data obtained on C-doped single crystals by Gonnelli _et al._,15 we have not found any stronger tendency to blend both gaps down to T_{c} = 22 K. On the other hand, our data are very compatible with the recent ARPES measurements of Tsuda _et al._,14 where both gaps have been directly seen in the raw data down to T_{c} of 23 K. A presence of the two gaps is also evidenced by the PC measurements of Schmidt _et al._13 on the heavily carbon-doped MgB2. We remark that the data showing no merging of the gaps on the heavily doped MgB2 with _T__c_'s down to 22 K have been collected from the measurements on the samples of different forms (wires, sintered pellets, and polycrystals) prepared by different methods. It is also important that the two gaps have been directly experimentally evidenced in the raw data without any dependence on the model or fit.

Theoretical calculations of Erwin and Mazin29 on merging of the gaps due to a substitution support the picture presented here. According to this work, the carbon substitution on the boron site should have zero effect on the merging of the gaps. This is due to the fact that replacing boron by carbon does not change the local point symmetry in the p and s orbitals which are both centered at the boron sites. Consequently, the interband scattering will only increase if extra defects are incorporated as a result of doping that produces a change of the symmetry of the orbitals. On the other hand, much bigger effect is expected for the out-of-plane substitutions (Al instead of Mg) or defects which would indeed change the local point symmetry. The substitution of Al instead of Mg leads also to a significant decrease of the _c_-lattice parameter16 (it is basically useless in the case of carbon doping), which helps the interlayer hopping from a p_{c} orbital (_p_ band) in one atomic layer to a s bond orbital in the next one. Of course, a particular strength of the interband scattering can vary among samples due to a lack of control over defect type and their density. Thus, the merging of the two gaps can indeed be strongly sample dependent.

In the following paragraph, we will focus on more quantitative analysis of the magnetic-field effect on the point-contact spectra of the Al- and C-doped MgB2, which can yield information on the intraband scattering processes in the samples. In both sets of the Al- and C-doped samples shown in Figs. 1 and 2 strong effect of an applied magnetic field on the _p_-band-gap peak has been observed. It is a consequence of a rapid filling of the _p_-band-gap states up to a crossover _p_-band "upper critical field" _H__c_2,m. At higher fields, the superconducting properties are determined mainly by the s band, and the real upper critical field can be identified with _H__c_2 = _H__c_2,m.30 If the samples are in the clean superconducting limit, a magnitude of the upper critical fields of the two bands can be estimated31 as H_{c,2,\pi} = \Delta_{\pi}^{2}/v_{F,\pi}^{2} and H_{c2,\sigma} = \Delta_{\sigma}^{2}/v_{F,\sigma}^{2} with _v__F,m or _v__F,m the Fermi velocity of the respective band (since here only _H__c_21c is considered, the anisotropy due to an effective mass tensor is neglected). A similar estimate can be done in the dirty limit by taking into account the

  respective diffusion coefficients D_{p}(_s_). Then, _H__c_2,p_(_s_) is proportional to D_{p}(_s_)/_D__p_(_s_). Koshelev and Golubov have shown in their model [32] that in a two-band superconductor in the dirty limit, the gap filling in the presence of magnetic field is a function of the intraband diffusivities. They have calculated maximum pair potentials Dmax and averaged zero-energy densities of states N_{p}(_s_) in both bands as a function of magnetic field normalized to the upper critical one _H__c_2|_k_c_ and found that the field slope of N_{p}(0,_H_) is very sensitive to the ratio of the diffusion coefficients _D__s_/_D__p_.

Recently, Bugoslavsky _et al._ proposed an empirical model which enables to infer the zero-energy averaged density of states as a function of magnetic field from the PC conductance data measured in the mixed state. [33] In this model, vortex cores represent a normal-state region n, where n = _N_A_/_A_ is a factor characterizing the normal-state region _N_A_ of the PC junction area A. This normal-state region and/or vortex density increases linearly up to the upper critical magnetic field. In order to take into account the normal cores of vortices, the point-contact conductance will be a sum _G_/_G__N_(_V_) = n + (1 - _n_)_g_, where n represents the normal-state channel and (1 - _n_)_g the superconducting channel contribution normalized to the normal-state PC conductance G_{N}(_V_). In the case of a two-gap superconductor, the normalized PC conductance will be represented as a weighted sum of both band contributions as follows:

\[\begin{equation*}G/G_{n}(V) \approx \alpha [n_{\pi} + (1 - n_{\pi})g_{\pi}] + (1 - \alpha )[n_{\sigma} + (1 - n_{\sigma})g_{\sigma}]. \end{equation*}\]

Considering that n_{p} and n_{s} represent the number of normal-state vortex-core excitations, these parameters can be identified with the zero-energy density of states N_{p}(0,_H_) and N_{p}(0,_H_) averaged over the vortex lattice. [34] In this way, the field dependent energy gaps and zero-energy DOS _N_(0,_H_) can be determined.

Unfortunately, the fitting of the PC conductance of MgB2 in the mixed state is not trivial because of the number of variables as many as 9. Moreover, two pairs of the parameters N_{p} vs G and N_{s} vs G manifest themselves very similarly in the fit. Hence, before fitting the spectra the formula (2), we estimate N_{p}(0,_H_) values from the excess currents I_{c}, calculated from the PC spectra integrating the superconducting area. Here, the following simplifications are made. For the case of a two-gap superconductor, I_{c} is represented similarly, like in formula (2), as a weighted sum of the both band contributions, [35]I_{exc} = \alpha (1 - n_{\pi})\Delta_{\pi} + (1 - \alpha )(1 - n_{\sigma})\Delta_{\sigma}. If the real upper critical field _H__c_2 is large compared to _H__c_2,m, in the region 0 < H < H < H < H < H < 2, the suppression of the _s_-band contribution by the field can be neglected [_N__s_(0,_H_) = 0]. If we also neglect a small reduction of the energy gaps at these fields, [33,36] then I_{c}(_H_) can be represented by a single parameter formula expressed as I_{exc} \propto \alpha [1 - N_{\pi}(0,H)]\Delta_{\pi}(0) + (1 - \alpha )\Delta_{\sigma}(0), since all other parameters [D_p_(0), D_p_(0), and _a_] have already been determined from the BTK fit at H = 0. The resulting N_{p}(0,_H_) is later used as a first approximation in the fit of the PC conductance spectrum. There, also the values of z_{p}, z_{s}, G, G, and G determined from BTK fits at H = 0 are kept unchanged. In the second step, all parameters except for z_{p}, z_{p} and a are adjusted for the best fit. The fitting curves are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 by open circles. The resulting values of N_{p}(0,_H_) are decreased by 5%-20% in comparison with the first estimate from I_{c}(_H_). [37] Also, the values of the smearing parameters G, and G, reveal about 10%-20% of increase in the interval 0 < H < 1 T accounting for the magnetic pair breaking of the superconducting DOS. In the same field interval, a small (=5% -10%) suppression of the values of the energy gaps has been obtained.

The zero-energy DOS N_{p}(0,_H_) has been calculated for several point contacts on every particular doped sample. In none of the cases a linear increase of N_{p}(0,_H_) has been observed. On the contrary, a strong nonlinearity observed in all curves points to two gaps in the quasiparticle spectrum of the material. We ascribe a rapid increase of N_{p}(0,_H_) at low magnetic fields to a strong filling of the _p_-band-gap states up to the _p_-band crossover upper critical field _H__c_2,m. Then, at higher fields, the low-temperature superconductivity is maintained mainly by the s band, [30] with the s gap getting filled smoothly up to the real upper critical field of the material _H__c_2=_H_c_2,m. Due to a small but finite coupling of the two bands, the superconductivity is maintained also in the p band above _H__c_2,m, but as shown in the tunneling data of Eskildsen _et al._, [38] the _p_-gap states are filled much more slowly here than in the low-field region. Due to the measurements on the polycrystalline specimens, an orientation of applied magnetic field with respect to the particular crystallite under the point contact is not controlled, but independent of the random-field orientation, the resulting N_{p}(0,_H_) dependencies for a particular aluminum- or carbon-doped sample are practically identical in the range of smaller fields up to 1 - 1.5 T. This fact underlines an isotropic character of the p band in our samples. Moreover, no change was observed in the field dependencies of N_{p}(0,_H_) measured on the samples with different Al concentrations. It suggests the unchanged upper critical field of the _p_-band _H__c_2,m here. Then, the doping independent _H__c_2,m2/_p_F_2,m (the clean limit) and almost constant D_p_ for x = 0 - 0.2 indicate that U_{F},m remains also unchanged at this doping range. In the aluminum-doped MgB2, also the real upper critical field _H__c_2|_k_c_2 remains unchanged and is equal approximately to 3 T for all three dopings. [18] From this follows the constant ratio between D_s_ and U_{F},s, so the electron filling of the hole s band decreases both parameters proportionally. In Fig. 5(a), the zero-energy DOSs N_{p}(0,_H_) are shown as a function of applied field normalized to _H__c_2  respective H_{c2|k} (in Fig. 5 denoted as h), it can be seen that the \pi-band crossover upper critical field H_{c2,\pi} is enhanced stronger than H_{c2|c,\sigma}. In the previous paragraphs, we have shown that the ratio between the \sigma and \pi gaps is approximately constant at different carbon concentrations. Then, the change of the position of H_{c2,\pi} with respect to H_{c2|k} will be given by an increase of the ratio of the diffusion coefficients D_{\sigma}/D_{\pi}. Figure 5(b) shows by the dashed line the calculations of the model of Koshelev and Golubov [32] for D_{\sigma}/D_{\pi} =0.2, corresponding well with the data from the undoped dirty MgB_{2}. It means that the \sigma band in this case is dirtier than the \pi band. The subsequent decrease of the low-field slope of N_{\sigma}(0,h) upon the C doping can be explained by an increase of the D_{\sigma}/D_{\pi} ratio, i.e., by a more rapid enhancement of the \pi-band intraband scattering as compared with the scattering in the \sigma band. Indeed, the dotted line plotting the theoretical N_{\sigma}(0,h) dependence at D_{\sigma}/D_{\pi}=1 indicates this tendency.

## IV Conclusions

The comparative study between the Al- and C-doped MgB_{2} on the inter- and intraband scatterings has been performed by means of the point-contact spectroscopy in magnetic field. It has been shown that the decreased transition temperatures and the evolution of two superconducting energy gaps upon both substitutions are mainly consequence of the band-filling effect. However, especially in the case of Al doping, also an increase of the interband scattering has to be taken into account to explain the behavior of both gaps as a function of T_{c}. By the analysis of the field effect on the point-contact spectra, it has been shown that the C doping increases the scattering in the \pi band more rapidly than in the \sigma band. On the other hand, the Al doping does not introduce significant scatterings within the two bands and the samples remain in the clean limit.

A relative weight of the intraband scattering is estimated from the fitting of the field dependence of the PC spectra to a simple empirical model. Significant changes in the relative weighting of the scattering are found in the case of C doping because of the increased scattering particularly in the \pi band. The Al doping does not change the relative weight of the scatterings within the bands, and the samples seem to stay in the clean limit.

## II Experiment

Polycrystalline samples Mg0.0Al0.1B2 and Mg0.0Al0.2B2 with T_{c}=30.5 and 23.5 K, respectively, have been prepared by a two-step synthesis at high temperatures.[18] The carbon substituted samples Mg(B(1(1-y)C)2, with y = 0.055, 0.065, and 0.1 and with corresponding transition temperatures T_{c}=33, 28, and 22 K, were synthesized in the form of pellets following the procedure described in Ref. [18] from magnesium lumps and B4C powder. In the case of y=0.021 and 0.038, we have worked with the wire segments exhibiting T_{c} =37.5, and 36.2 K, respectively.[20] For the undoped MgB2, two kinds of samples have been used: very clean MgB2 wires (the residual resistivity of 0.5 \mu\Omega cm) with T_{c}=39 K and the small upper critical magnetic fields H_{c21c}= 3 T,[20] compatible with the clean limit theoretical calculations,[21] and the polycrystalline pellets prepared from boron and magnesium powder[4] also with T_{c}=39 K but with a higher upper critical field H_{c21c}= 5 T in a dirty limit.

The point-contact measurements have been performed in the way described previously.[12] The applied magnetic field was always oriented perpendicular to the sample surface and parallel with the tip having the point-contact area in the vortex state. The point-contact spectrum (the differential conductance as a function of applied voltage) has been theoretically described by the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) theory[22] using as input parameters the energy gap \Delta, the parameter z (measure for the strength of the interface barrier), and the parameter \Gamma for the spectral broadening.[23] In the case of two-gap superconductor, the voltage-dependent normalized point-contact conductance can be expressed as a weighted sum of two partial conductances g_{\sigma(\pi)}, those from the quasi-two-dimensional \sigma band (with a large gap \Delta_{\sigma}) and those from the three-dimensional \pi band (with a small gap \Delta_{\pi}), as follows:

\[G/G_{a}(V)=\alpha g_{\pi}+(1-\alpha)g_{\sigma}.\] (1)

The weight factor \alpha for the \pi-band contribution can vary from 0.6 for the point-contact current strictly in the MgB2 ab plane to 0.99 in the _c_-axis direction.[24] The two-band BTK model does not include the effect of interband scattering and is thus limited to a weak scattering between the bands. Recently, Dolgov _et al.[25]_ have shown that an increased interband scattering mixing the pairs in the two bands (the states appear in the \sigma band at the energy range of the \pi-band gap) will broaden the resulting total density of states. In this case also, the point-contact spectrum will get broadened. Nevertheless, fitting to the simple two-band BTK model can still provide a good estimate of the size of the gaps if they are resolved in the measured spectrum.

## III Results and Discussion

A large number of the point-contact measurements have been performed on the investigated samples of pure MgB2 and both substituted series. Since the C doping leads the MgB2 samples deeply into the dirty limit (with an increase of H_{c2} despite a decreased T_{c}), we have chosen the undoped MgB2 sample being already in a dirty limit for a comparison with the C-doped samples in the discussion about the effect of magnetic field. On the other hand, the Al doping seems to keep the clean limit conditions. Thus, we have chosen the pure MgB2 wire as a reference in the studies of the magnetic-field effects. By trial and error, we looked for the spectra showing both gaps in polycrystalline specimens. For more detailed studies, we chose the junctions revealing the spectra with a low spectral broadening \Gamma, i.e., with an intensive signal in the normalized PC conductance. As a result, we succeeded in obtaining many point-contact spectra with well resolved two superconducting gaps directly visible in the raw data for all of the studied substitutions except for the highest dopings, namely, Mg0.8Al0.2B2 and Mg(B0.9C0.1)2. As shown in the following, the application of magnetic field can help resolve the two gaps directly also in these cases. Figure 1 displays the representative spectra of the Al-doped series. The upper curves in the panels are the spectra in zero magnetic field, and the others display an effect of the field. Figure 2 shows in the same way the results for the C-doped

  MgB_{2}. The experimental data are presented by the full lines, while the fits to the two-gap formula are indicated by the open circles. The fitting formula for the spectra in magnetic field is explained below. All shown PC spectra have been normalized to the spectra measured in the normal state at a temperature above T_{c}.

The retention of two gaps for all dopings apart from the highest substitution is evident already at zero magnetic field. For the highest dopings (always with a larger spectral broadening, G = 0.2D), the spectra reveal only one pair of peaks without an apparent shoulder at the expected position of the second gap. The size of the apparent gap is well indicated by the peak position, which is about 2 meV for MgB0.8Al0.2B_{2} and 1.6 meV for Mg(B0.9C0.1)2. However, this size is too small to explain the superconductivity with the respective T_{c}'s equal to 23.5 and 22 K within the single-gap BCS scenario. The presented data document a strong effect of magnetic field on the \pi-band contribution to the spectrum. The zero-field spectrum of the clean undoped MgB_{2} measured on the wire sample (bottom panel in Fig. 1) reveals a clear two-gap structure. At small fields, the peak corresponding to the small gap D_{\pi} is very rapidly suppressed and only the peak related to the large gap D_{\sigma} is apparently visible above 1 T. At 10% of Al doping, the zero-field spectra also show both gaps, but the large one is now revealed more as a pronounced shoulder. Again at a small magnetic field, the \pi-band-gap peak is rapidly suppressed but its signature is still distinguishable at 0.5 T. At higher fields, the signatures of both gaps are not resolvable due to an interference of the related peaks placed at closed positions. The resulting maximum is located in the intermediate position between them. At the highest doping (20% Al), such an interference of even closer gaps is graduated; so, already at zero magnetic field one can see only one pair of peaks at the position of the small gap (it always has much higher weight at zero field) and a minor shoulder at the voltage of the large one. In the increasing field, the peak position, which is about 2 mV in zero field, is shifted toward 3 mV at 1 T. In the case of a single-gap superconductor, the application of magnetic field can only lead to a shrinkage of the distance between the peak positions in the PC spectrum. This is a simple consequence of the introduction of the vortices and magnetic pair breaking.[26] The shift of the peak of the PC spectra to higher voltages is then due to an interplay between the two gaps. The dominance of the D_{\pi} peak at zero field is suppressed in increasing magnetic field and D_{\sigma} contributes more.

In Fig. 2, the existence of both gaps is evidenced in a similar way for the 6.5% and 10% carbon dopings. For example, in the upper panel, the spectrum at \mu_{0}H=0.5 T shows that the \pi-band-gap peak at 1.6 mV is already partially suppressed and the large-gap shoulder clearly appears near 3 mV. We remark that for the 10% C-doped MgB_{2}, the existence of the large gap has also been shown in our previous paper by PC spectroscopy[12] and also by the specific-heat measurements on the samples from the same batch as used here.[27]

The overall statistics of the energy gaps obtained from fitting of the zero-field PC spectra to the two-band BTK formula is shown in Fig. 3 for each C and Al concentration. The left coordinate indicates the transition temperature of the junctions, while the right one counts the number of junctions with the same size of the gaps. The energy width of a particular count indicates the fitting uncertainty. All the samples, the undoped MgB_{2} as well as the Al- and C-doped materials,

  reveal a certain distribution of the small and large gaps, but the two gaps are well distinguishable in the histogram and no overlap of D_a_ and D_m_ is observed. Already from this figure, a general tendency is evident, namely, that the reduction of the large gap is proportional to the decreasing transition temperature. On the other hand, the changes in the small gap are proportionally smaller.

Figure 4 summarizes the energy gaps as a function of _T__c_'s. The points (open squares for Al dopings and solid circles for C ones) are positioned at the averaged energies of the gap distributions in Fig. 3, and the error bars represent the standard deviations. The large gap D_a_ is essentially decreased linearly with the corresponding _T__c_'s. The behavior of D_a_'s is more complicated. For both kinds of substitution, the gap is almost unchanged at smaller dopings. In the case of C-doped MgB2, it clearly holds down to T_{c} = 33 K. In the case of (Mg,Al)B2, D_m_ of the 10% Al-doped sample seems to even slightly increase, but for the highest dopings, D_m_ decreases in both doping cases. The solid lines in Fig. 4 are calculations of Kortus _et al._10 for the case of a pure band-filling effect and no interband scattering. Although the constant D_a_ is not reproduced, the T_{c} dependence of D's for carbon doping can be broadly described indicating smaller interband scattering. The dashed lines show the calculations of Kortus _et al._ including the interband scattering with the rate g_JB_ = 1000x cm-1 (or 2000y cm-1). As can be seen, the evolution of the gaps in the Al-doped samples cannot be accounted for without an interband scattering, although its rate is certainly smaller than in the presented calculations. A proper weighting of both effects will naturally explain the constant value of the _p_-band gap and the expected position of gaps merging in both doping cases.

Recently, similar results on the superconducting energy gaps have been obtained with the Al-doped single crystals by Klein _et al._28 exploring the specific heat as well as the PC spectroscopy measurements. Those data also show a tendency of approaching of the two gaps with their possible merging in the Al-doped samples with T_{c} below 10-15 K. It is worth noticing that our previous results28 and those presented here show neither a decrease of the large gap below the canonical BCS value16 nor a drop of D_m_ below 1 meV (Ref. [17]) for the Al-doped MgB2 with _T__c_'s below 30 K found earlier.

In contrast with the data obtained on C-doped single crystals by Gonnelli _et al._,15 we have not found any stronger tendency to blend both gaps down to T_{c} = 22 K. On the other hand, our data are very compatible with the recent ARPES measurements of Tsuda _et al._,14 where both gaps have been directly seen in the raw data down to T_{c} of 23 K. A presence of the two gaps is also evidenced by the PC measurements of Schmidt _et al._13 on the heavily carbon-doped MgB2. We remark that the data showing no merging of the gaps on the heavily doped MgB2 with _T__c_'s down to 22 K have been collected from the measurements on the samples of different forms (wires, sintered pellets, and polycrystals) prepared by different methods. It is also important that the two gaps have been directly experimentally evidenced in the raw data without any dependence on the model or fit.

Theoretical calculations of Erwin and Mazin29 on merging of the gaps due to a substitution support the picture presented here. According to this work, the carbon substitution on the boron site should have zero effect on the merging of the gaps. This is due to the fact that replacing boron by carbon does not change the local point symmetry in the p and s orbitals which are both centered at the boron sites. Consequently, the interband scattering will only increase if extra defects are incorporated as a result of doping that produces a change of the symmetry of the orbitals. On the other hand, much bigger effect is expected for the out-of-plane substitutions (Al instead of Mg) or defects which would indeed change the local point symmetry. The substitution of Al instead of Mg leads also to a significant decrease of the _c_-lattice parameter16 (it is basically useless in the case of carbon doping), which helps the interlayer hopping from a p_{c} orbital (_p_ band) in one atomic layer to a s bond orbital in the next one. Of course, a particular strength of the interband scattering can vary among samples due to a lack of control over defect type and their density. Thus, the merging of the two gaps can indeed be strongly sample dependent.

In the following paragraph, we will focus on more quantitative analysis of the magnetic-field effect on the point-contact spectra of the Al- and C-doped MgB2, which can yield information on the intraband scattering processes in the samples. In both sets of the Al- and C-doped samples shown in Figs. 1 and 2 strong effect of an applied magnetic field on the _p_-band-gap peak has been observed. It is a consequence of a rapid filling of the _p_-band-gap states up to a crossover _p_-band "upper critical field" _H__c_2,m. At higher fields, the superconducting properties are determined mainly by the s band, and the real upper critical field can be identified with _H__c_2 = _H__c_2,m.30 If the samples are in the clean superconducting limit, a magnitude of the upper critical fields of the two bands can be estimated31 as H_{c,2,\pi} = \Delta_{\pi}^{2}/v_{F,\pi}^{2} and H_{c2,\sigma} = \Delta_{\sigma}^{2}/v_{F,\sigma}^{2} with _v__F,m or _v__F,m the Fermi velocity of the respective band (since here only _H__c_21c is considered, the anisotropy due to an effective mass tensor is neglected). A similar estimate can be done in the dirty limit by taking into account the

  respective diffusion coefficients D_{p}(_s_). Then, _H__c_2,p_(_s_) is proportional to D_{p}(_s_)/_D__p_(_s_). Koshelev and Golubov have shown in their model [32] that in a two-band superconductor in the dirty limit, the gap filling in the presence of magnetic field is a function of the intraband diffusivities. They have calculated maximum pair potentials Dmax and averaged zero-energy densities of states N_{p}(_s_) in both bands as a function of magnetic field normalized to the upper critical one _H__c_2|_k_c_ and found that the field slope of N_{p}(0,_H_) is very sensitive to the ratio of the diffusion coefficients _D__s_/_D__p_.

Recently, Bugoslavsky _et al._ proposed an empirical model which enables to infer the zero-energy averaged density of states as a function of magnetic field from the PC conductance data measured in the mixed state. [33] In this model, vortex cores represent a normal-state region n, where n = _N_A_/_A_ is a factor characterizing the normal-state region _N_A_ of the PC junction area A. This normal-state region and/or vortex density increases linearly up to the upper critical magnetic field. In order to take into account the normal cores of vortices, the point-contact conductance will be a sum _G_/_G__N_(_V_) = n + (1 - _n_)_g_, where n represents the normal-state channel and (1 - _n_)_g the superconducting channel contribution normalized to the normal-state PC conductance G_{N}(_V_). In the case of a two-gap superconductor, the normalized PC conductance will be represented as a weighted sum of both band contributions as follows:

\[\begin{equation*}G/G_{n}(V) \approx \alpha [n_{\pi} + (1 - n_{\pi})g_{\pi}] + (1 - \alpha )[n_{\sigma} + (1 - n_{\sigma})g_{\sigma}]. \end{equation*}\]

Considering that n_{p} and n_{s} represent the number of normal-state vortex-core excitations, these parameters can be identified with the zero-energy density of states N_{p}(0,_H_) and N_{p}(0,_H_) averaged over the vortex lattice. [34] In this way, the field dependent energy gaps and zero-energy DOS _N_(0,_H_) can be determined.

Unfortunately, the fitting of the PC conductance of MgB2 in the mixed state is not trivial because of the number of variables as many as 9. Moreover, two pairs of the parameters N_{p} vs G and N_{s} vs G manifest themselves very similarly in the fit. Hence, before fitting the spectra the formula (2), we estimate N_{p}(0,_H_) values from the excess currents I_{c}, calculated from the PC spectra integrating the superconducting area. Here, the following simplifications are made. For the case of a two-gap superconductor, I_{c} is represented similarly, like in formula (2), as a weighted sum of the both band contributions, [35]I_{exc} = \alpha (1 - n_{\pi})\Delta_{\pi} + (1 - \alpha )(1 - n_{\sigma})\Delta_{\sigma}. If the real upper critical field _H__c_2 is large compared to _H__c_2,m, in the region 0 < H < H < H < H < H < 2, the suppression of the _s_-band contribution by the field can be neglected [_N__s_(0,_H_) = 0]. If we also neglect a small reduction of the energy gaps at these fields, [33,36] then I_{c}(_H_) can be represented by a single parameter formula expressed as I_{exc} \propto \alpha [1 - N_{\pi}(0,H)]\Delta_{\pi}(0) + (1 - \alpha )\Delta_{\sigma}(0), since all other parameters [D_p_(0), D_p_(0), and _a_] have already been determined from the BTK fit at H = 0. The resulting N_{p}(0,_H_) is later used as a first approximation in the fit of the PC conductance spectrum. There, also the values of z_{p}, z_{s}, G, G, and G determined from BTK fits at H = 0 are kept unchanged. In the second step, all parameters except for z_{p}, z_{p} and a are adjusted for the best fit. The fitting curves are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 by open circles. The resulting values of N_{p}(0,_H_) are decreased by 5%-20% in comparison with the first estimate from I_{c}(_H_). [37] Also, the values of the smearing parameters G, and G, reveal about 10%-20% of increase in the interval 0 < H < 1 T accounting for the magnetic pair breaking of the superconducting DOS. In the same field interval, a small (=5% -10%) suppression of the values of the energy gaps has been obtained.

The zero-energy DOS N_{p}(0,_H_) has been calculated for several point contacts on every particular doped sample. In none of the cases a linear increase of N_{p}(0,_H_) has been observed. On the contrary, a strong nonlinearity observed in all curves points to two gaps in the quasiparticle spectrum of the material. We ascribe a rapid increase of N_{p}(0,_H_) at low magnetic fields to a strong filling of the _p_-band-gap states up to the _p_-band crossover upper critical field _H__c_2,m. Then, at higher fields, the low-temperature superconductivity is maintained mainly by the s band, [30] with the s gap getting filled smoothly up to the real upper critical field of the material _H__c_2=_H_c_2,m. Due to a small but finite coupling of the two bands, the superconductivity is maintained also in the p band above _H__c_2,m, but as shown in the tunneling data of Eskildsen _et al._, [38] the _p_-gap states are filled much more slowly here than in the low-field region. Due to the measurements on the polycrystalline specimens, an orientation of applied magnetic field with respect to the particular crystallite under the point contact is not controlled, but independent of the random-field orientation, the resulting N_{p}(0,_H_) dependencies for a particular aluminum- or carbon-doped sample are practically identical in the range of smaller fields up to 1 - 1.5 T. This fact underlines an isotropic character of the p band in our samples. Moreover, no change was observed in the field dependencies of N_{p}(0,_H_) measured on the samples with different Al concentrations. It suggests the unchanged upper critical field of the _p_-band _H__c_2,m here. Then, the doping independent _H__c_2,m2/_p_F_2,m (the clean limit) and almost constant D_p_ for x = 0 - 0.2 indicate that U_{F},m remains also unchanged at this doping range. In the aluminum-doped MgB2, also the real upper critical field _H__c_2|_k_c_2 remains unchanged and is equal approximately to 3 T for all three dopings. [18] From this follows the constant ratio between D_s_ and U_{F},s, so the electron filling of the hole s band decreases both parameters proportionally. In Fig. 5(a), the zero-energy DOSs N_{p}(0,_H_) are shown as a function of applied field normalized to _H__c_2  respective H_{c2|k} (in Fig. 5 denoted as h), it can be seen that the \pi-band crossover upper critical field H_{c2,\pi} is enhanced stronger than H_{c2|c,\sigma}. In the previous paragraphs, we have shown that the ratio between the \sigma and \pi gaps is approximately constant at different carbon concentrations. Then, the change of the position of H_{c2,\pi} with respect to H_{c2|k} will be given by an increase of the ratio of the diffusion coefficients D_{\sigma}/D_{\pi}. Figure 5(b) shows by the dashed line the calculations of the model of Koshelev and Golubov [32] for D_{\sigma}/D_{\pi} =0.2, corresponding well with the data from the undoped dirty MgB_{2}. It means that the \sigma band in this case is dirtier than the \pi band. The subsequent decrease of the low-field slope of N_{\sigma}(0,h) upon the C doping can be explained by an increase of the D_{\sigma}/D_{\pi} ratio, i.e., by a more rapid enhancement of the \pi-band intraband scattering as compared with the scattering in the \sigma band. Indeed, the dotted line plotting the theoretical N_{\sigma}(0,h) dependence at D_{\sigma}/D_{\pi}=1 indicates this tendency.

## IV Conclusions

The comparative study between the Al- and C-doped MgB_{2} on the inter- and intraband scatterings has been performed by means of the point-contact spectroscopy in magnetic field. It has been shown that the decreased transition temperatures and the evolution of two superconducting energy gaps upon both substitutions are mainly consequence of the band-filling effect. However, especially in the case of Al doping, also an increase of the interband scattering has to be taken into account to explain the behavior of both gaps as a function of T_{c}. By the analysis of the field effect on the point-contact spectra, it has been shown that the C doping increases the scattering in the \pi band more rapidly than in the \sigma band. On the other hand, the Al doping does not introduce significant scatterings within the two bands and the samples remain in the clean limit.

Figure 5: (a) Zero-energy DOS N_{\pi}(0,h) of Mg_{1-x}Al_{1}B_{2} determined from the fitting to the two-band mixed-state BTK formula. The applied field has been rescaled to the value of H_{c2|k}^{m}^{3} T (Ref. 18). (b) N_{\pi}(0,h) of Mg(B_{(1-y)}C_{y})_{2}. The applied field has been rescaled to H_{c2|k}^{m}^{5} S, 8, and 8 T. (Refs. 4 and 39) The dashed and dotted lines represent the theoretical predictions of N_{\pi}(0,h) (Ref. 32) for the dirty MgB_{2} samples with the ratios of in-plane diffusivities D_{\sigma}/D_{\pi}=0.2 and 1, respectively. The solid lines are guides for the eyes.
