###### Abstract

The upper and lower critical fields have been deduced from specific heat and Hall-probe magnetization measurements in nonoptimally doped Nd(O,F)FeAs single crystals (T_{c} \sim 32-35 K). The anisotropy of the penetration depth (\Gamma_{\lambda}) is temperature independent and on the order of 4.0 \pm 1.5. Similarly specific-heat data lead to an anisotropy of the coherence length \Gamma_{\xi} \sim 5.5 \pm 1.5 close to T_{c}. Our results suggest the presence of rather large thermal fluctuations and the existence of a vortex liquid phase over a broad temperature range (\sim 5 K large at 2 T).

The recent discovery of superconductivity at unusually high temperature (up to 56 K) in rare-earth iron oxypnictides [1, 2] has been the focus of a tremendous number of theoretical and experimental works in the past few months. The possible coexistence of superconductivity with a complex magnetic structure [3] makes this system particularly fascinating and a nonconventional pairing mechanism (associated with multigap superconductivity in electron and hole pockets) has been suggested by different groups [4]. In this context, it is very important to have a precise determination of the temperature dependence of the critical fields and corresponding anisotropies.

We will focus on the superconducting properties of the NdFeAs(O,F) compound [5]. The aim of this Rapid Communication is to present combined Hall-probe magnetization and specific-heat (C_{p}) measurements performed on Nd-doped single crystals. A superconducting anomaly was clearly visible in C_{p} around 35 K and, as previously observed in high-T_{c} oxides, this anomaly is symmetric and broad and rapidly collapses as the magnetic field is increased. On the other hand, the lower critical field presents a classical temperature dependence for both H_{a}\|c and H_{a}\|ab [with H_{c1}^{c}(0) \sim 120 \pm 30 G and H_{c1}^{c} \sim 40 \pm 10 G] and the anisotropy of the penetration depth remains on the order of 4 on the entire temperature range. A similar anisotropy is obtained for the upper critical field from the C_{p} measurements.

NdFeAs(O,F) samples have been synthesized at high pressure in a cubic multitail apparatus. More details of the synthesis are given elsewhere [6]. Both Hall-probe magnetization and C_{p} measurements have been performed on the same plateletlike single crystals extracted from the polycrystalline batch [with dimensions of \sim 100 \times 100 \times 30 \mum^{3} (sample 1), \sim120 \times 80 \times 30 \mum^{3} (sample 2), and \sim170 \times 100 \times 50 \mum^{3} (sample 3)].

The local magnetization of the platelet has been measured by placing the sample on the top of an array of miniature Hall probes of dimensions 4 \times 4 or 8 \times 8 \mum^{2}. The ac trans-mittivity (T_{\rm ac}^{\prime}, related to the _local susceptibility_) has been measured by applying a small (\sim 1 G) a field and recording the corresponding response of the probe as a function of the temperature [see Fig. 1(a)]. T_{\rm ac}^{\prime} is obtained by subtracting the response in the normal state from the data and is rescaled to -1 at T = 4.2 K (due to the small but nonzero distance between the probe and the sample surface, about 10% of the external field is still picked up by the probe in the superconducting state). As shown in Fig. 1(a), the transmittivity measured in the center of the sample first presents a small paramagnetic increase starting at \sim37 K followed by a sharp diamagnetic jump at T \sim 34 K (sample 1). This paramagnetic bump (also observed in zero-field-cooled dc measurements) reflects a nonhomogeneous distribution of the field [7] between 34 and 37 K. However, the presence of a clear anomaly in the specific heat emphasizes the overall good quality of the platelets. A similar bump has been observed in sample 2 between 34.5 and 37.5 K and in sample 3 between 36.5 and 37.5 K. Note also that previous global magnetization measurements [8] yield no onset of the diamagnetic response of the polycrystalline batch around T \sim 51 K, in agreement with a resistivity T_{c} on the order of 50 K for optimally doped samples [5]. We did not find any sign of superconductivity around 51 K in our platelets, indicating that the diamagnetic response observed above 40 K in global statements is due to a distribution of T_{c} values (i.e., F content) within the polycrystalline batch.

Specific-heat measurements have been performed on the same crystallites (samples 1 and 2) using an ac technique. This high-sensitivity technique (typically 1 part in 10^{4}) is very well adapted to measuring C_{p} of very small samples. Heat was supplied to the sample at a frequency \omega = 10 Hz by a light-emitting diode via an optical fiber. The temperature oscillations have been recorded with a thermocouple which has been calibrated from measurements on ultrapure silicon. The superconducting contribution to the specific heat (\Delta C_{p}) has been obtained by subtracting the curve at \mu_{0}H_{a}= 7 T  (for H_{a}|c) from the curves obtained for lower fields as well as a (H_{a}/T)^{2} contribution to account for the presence of a magnetic background. As shown in Fig. 1(b) (sample 1), there is no sharp discontinuity at T_{c} and the anomaly has the shape of a rounded peak with a height on the order of a few 10^{-3} of the total specific heat. The other striking behavior is the influence of the magnetic field. As previously observed in cuprates,[9] the smearing of the anomaly with field is unexpectedly strong with an almost field-independent onset. The maximum of C_{p} is pushed downward in temperature by the field with a characteristic average slope on the order of -2 T/K for H_{a}|c and -7 T/K for H_{a}|ab (compared to -1.5 and -9 T/K, respectively, in optimally doped YBaCuO; note that the shift is possibly nonlinear for small magnetic field and see solid line in Fig. 2 and discussion below). As in cuprates, the shape of the anomaly precludes any precise determination of H_{c2}. However, assuming that H_{c2} is close to the maximum of C_{p} (H_{\rm max}) and taking the corresponding linear temperature dependence, we hence get H_{c2}(0)\!\sim\!0.7\times\!dH_{\rm max}/dT\!\times\!T_{c}\!\sim\!40 and \sim170 T for H_{a}|c and H_{a}|ab, respectively. The corresponding anisotropy of the coherence length \Gamma_{\xi}\!=\!\xi_{c}/\xi_{ab}\!=\!\Gamma_{H_{c2}} is hence on the order of H_{c2}^{ab}(0)/H_{c2}^{c}(0)\!\sim\!4. The uncertainty on the H_{c2} values is rather large but \Gamma_{\xi} can also be estimated from the total shape of the anomaly.

  of the anomaly, writing \Delta C(\Gamma_{\xi}\!\times\!H_{a}\!\parallel\!ab)\!\sim\!\Delta C(H_{a}\! \parallel\!c), consistently leading to \Gamma_{\xi}\!\sim\!5.5\!\div\!1.5. This value is also in good agreement with the one previously reported by Welp _et al._[10] and with recent band-structure calculations.[11]

The influence of H_{a} on the C_{p} anomaly and its overall shape is strikingly different from the one observed in classical superconductors or even in the (K, Ba)BiO_{3} system (T_{c}\!\sim\!32 K) (Ref. [12]) or MgB_{2} (T_{c}\!\sim\!39 K) (Ref. [13]) of similar T_{c} values. It is tempting to attribute these deviations to fluctuation effects. To reinforce this idea, it is worth noting that the onset of the diamagnetic response well coincides with the inflection point of the C_{p} anomaly for H_{a}\!=\!0 but is pushed toward substantially lower temperature in field (\sim\!5 K lower than the C_{p} shift for \mu_{0}H_{a}\!\!=\!2 T). As T_{ac}^{\infty} is sensitive to pinning, this result suggests that the irreversibility line is well separated from the superconducting transition for H_{a}\!\neq\!0 (see inset of Fig. 2(b) for H_{a}\!\parallel\!c; a similar result--not shown--is obtained for H_{a}\!\parallel\!ab), supporting the idea of an extended vortex liquid phase. The importance of thermal fluctuations can be quantified by the Ginzburg number [14]G_{i}\!=\!(k_{B}T_{c}/\epsilon_{0}\xi_{c})^{2}/8, where \epsilon_{0}\! [=\!(\Phi_{0}/4\pi\omega_{ab})^{2}] is the line tension of the vortex matter. Large \lambda values (see below) combined with small \xi values hence lead here to \epsilon_{0}\xi_{c}\!\sim\!200 K (i.e., similar to cuprates) compared to \sim\!1000 K in (K, Ba)BiO_{3} and even \sim\!10^{4} in MgB_{2}. Although smaller than in cuprates due to smaller T_{c} values, thermal fluctuations are hence expected to play a role in this system possibly leading to the melting of the vortex solid (G_{i}\!\sim\!3\!\times\!10^{-3}\!-\!10^{-2}). A similar conclusion was drawn by Welp _et al._[10] Note that, as expected for vortex melting, the irreversibility line clearly presents a positive curvature [H_{\rm irr}\!\propto\!(1\!-\!T/T_{c})^{\alpha} with \alpha\!\sim\!1.5; for a review see Ref. [14]]. Similarly, thermal fluctuations may also induce an upward curvature in the H_{c2} line [15] but even though our data suggest the existence of such a curvature (see also Ref. [10]), we cannot unambiguously conclude given the uncertainties and limited temperature range of the C_{p} data.

The first penetration field H_{p} has been deduced by measuring the remanent field (B_{\rm rem}) in the sample after applying an external field H_{a} and sweeping the field back to zero. For H_{a}\!<\!H_{p} no vortices penetrate the sample and the remanent field remains equal to zero. H_{a} is progressively increased until a finite remanent field is obtained as vortices remain pinned in the sample for H_{a}\!>\!H_{p} [B_{\rm rem} increasing as (H_{a}\!-\!H_{p})^{2}; see solid line in the inset of Fig. 1(a)]. Theoretically speaking, H_{p} is expected to depend on the position of the probe, being larger in the center of the sample as vortices first remain pinned close to sample edges. However, experimentally, a nonzero B_{\rm rem} value could be detected almost simultaneously on all the probes due to the nonzero distance between the sample and the probe. Note that we did not observe any significant change in the B_{\rm rem}(H_{a}) curve up to H_{a}\!\sim\!3H_{p} as the magnetic field was tilted away from the c axis (with an angle \theta_{H_{a}}\!\leq\!60^{\circ}\!-\!70^{\circ}). Even though the angle between the internal field (\theta_{H}) and the c axis is reduced by the demagnetization effects, this surprising behavior suggests that the induction (B) in the sample remains perpendicular to the platelets up to large \theta_{H} values [see inset of Fig. 1(a) for sample 1 at \theta_{H_{a}}\!=\!7^{\circ} and 55^{\circ}]. B_{\rm rem} finally decreases with \theta for H_{a}\!\geq\!3H_{p} (and/or for \theta_{H_{a}}\!\geq\!70^{\circ}), indicating that the vortices finally align on the applied field for large H_{a} (and/or \theta_{H_{a}}) values.

In samples with rectangular cross sections, flux lines partially penetrate into the sample through the sharp corners even for H_{a}\!<\!H_{p} (Refs. [16, 17]) but remain "pinned" at the sample equator. The magnetization at H_{a}\!=\!H_{p} is then larger than H_{c1} and the standard "elliptical" correction for H_{c1} [=\!H_{p}/(1\!-\!N), where N is the demagnetization factor] cannot be used anymore. Following Ref. [16], in the presence of geometrical barriers, H_{p} is related to H_{c1} through H_{c1} \approx\!H_{p}/\!\tanh(\sqrt{ad/2w}), where \alpha varies from 0.36 in strips to 0.67 in disks (2w and d being the sample width and thickness, respectively). Taking an average \alpha value of \sim\!0.5,[18] we hence got[19]H_{c1}^{\prime}(0)\!\sim\!110\!\div\!20 G in sample 1, H_{c1}^{\prime}(0)\!\sim\!100\!\div\!20 G in sample 2, and H_{c1}^{\prime}(0)\!\sim\!140\!\div\!30 G in sample 3. To obtain H_{p} in the ab plane, sample 3 has been rotated by 90^{\circ} putting the probe on the small side of the sample [i.e., applying H_{a} along the long direction of the sample so that H_{p}^{\prime\prime\prime}(0)\!\sim\!H_{c1}^{\rm ob}]. We hence obtained H_{c1}^{\rm ob}\sim\!40\!\div\!10 G (in sample 3).

The temperature dependence of H_{c1} for both H_{a}\!\parallel\!c (samples 1 and 3; the data for sample 1 have been rescaled by a factor of 1.5) and H_{a}\!\parallel\!ab (sample 3) is displayed in Fig. 3. As shown, H_{c1}^{\prime} clearly flattens off at low temperatures (down to 1.6 K for sample 1), indicating that the gap is fully open in our NdAsFe(O,Fe) single crystals. This result is in striking contrast with H_{p} measurements in Ref. [21], which suggested that H_{c1} varies linearly at low temperature in LaFeAs(O,F), hence suggesting the existence of gapless su

Figure 3: Temperature dependence of the lower critical field H_{c1} along the c direction (solid squares for sample 3 and solid lozenges for sample 1, rescaled by a factor of 1.5) and ab plane for sample 3 (solid circles). The solid lines are the standard behaviors expected from the BCS theory. The corresponding temperature dependence of the anisotropy (\Gamma_{\lambda}\!=\!1.3\!\times\!\Gamma_{H_{c1}}) is also reported (open squares). The error bars correspond to the uncertainties on the determination of H_{p}; the whole curve might be shifted \pm\!1.5 due to the uncertainty of the demagnetization factor. In all cases, \Gamma_{\lambda} remains flat in T. The \Gamma_{\xi} values deduced from C_{p} (present work: open circles; Ref. [10]; open lozenge) and transport (Ref. [27]; open triangles) measurements are also displayed.

  perconductivity. On the other hand, a very similar temperature dependence [and H_{c1}(0) values] was recently obtained by Okazaki _et al.[22]_ in Pr-doped samples.

The lower critical field is related to the penetration depth through H_{c1}^{c}\!=\!\Phi_{0}^{2}/(4\pi\lambda_{ab}^{2})[Ln(\kappa)\!+\!c(\kappa)], where \kappa\!\!=\!\!\lambda_{ab}/\xi_{ab} (\xi being the coherence length) and c(\kappa) is a \kappa-dependent function tending toward \sim\!\!0.5 for large \kappa values. Taking H_{c2}^{c}(0)\!\sim\!40 T, one gets \lambda_{ab}(0)\!\sim\!270\!\pm\!40 nm.[23] Those \lambda values are consistent with those previously obtained in oxypnictides. Indeed, slightly lower \lambda_{ab} values (\sim\!200 nm) have been reported in both Sm- and Nd-doped samples with higher T_{c} (\sim\!50 K, from either torque,[20] muon relaxation,[24] or plasma frequency[25] measurements), whereas \lambda\sim\!360\!-\!390 nm have been obtained in La-doped samples with lower T_{c} values [\sim\!23 K (Refs. [21] and [26]].

For H||ab, H_{c1}^{ab}\!=\!\Phi_{0}^{2}/(4\pi\lambda_{ab}\lambda_{c})[Ln(\kappa^{*})\!+\! c(\kappa^{*})], with \kappa^{*} =\lambda_{c}/\xi_{ab}, and H_{c2}^{c}\!=\!\Phi_{0}^{2}/(2\pi\xi_{ab}\xi_{ab})\!\sim\!170 T, leading to \lambda_{c} \sim\!1200\!\pm\!200 nm and a corresponding anisotropy (\Gamma_{\lambda}) on the order of 4.0 (\pm 1.5), almost temperature independent down to 1.6 K (see Fig. 3, sample 3, \Gamma_{\lambda}\!\!=\!\Gamma_{H_{c1}}\times\{1+Ln(\Gamma_{\lambda})/[Ln(\kappa)\!+\!0.5]\}\!\sim\!1.3\times\Gamma_{H_{c1}}). Note that our data are in striking contrast with those deduced from torque measurements in Sm-doped samples[20] which led to strongly increasing \Gamma_{\lambda} values, exceeding 30 at low temperature. On the other hand, our \Gamma_{\lambda} consistently tends toward \Gamma_{\xi} for T\!\!\to\!T_{c} deduced either from C_{p} (present work and Ref. [10]) or transport data.[27] The difference between the anisotropies measured at low (\Gamma_{\lambda}) and high (\Gamma_{\xi}) fields remains within our error bars and we hence cannot comment on a possible similarity with MgB_{2} in which the coexistence of two gaps leads to a strong field and temperature dependence of the anisotropy.[28]

In conclusion, specific heat and Hall-probe magnetization data suggest that \Gamma_{\xi}\!\sim\!\Gamma_{\lambda}\!\sim\!5\!\pm\!2 in NdFeAs(F,O) single crystals. Whereas the irreversibility rapidly shifts toward lower temperature for increasing H_{o}, the C_{p} anomaly collapses and shows only a minor shift, suggesting the presence of strong thermal fluctuations possibly leading to the melting of the vortex solid.

###### Abstract

The upper and lower critical fields have been deduced from specific heat and Hall-probe magnetization measurements in nonoptimally doped Nd(O,F)FeAs single crystals (T_{c} \sim 32-35 K). The anisotropy of the penetration depth (\Gamma_{\lambda}) is temperature independent and on the order of 4.0 \pm 1.5. Similarly specific-heat data lead to an anisotropy of the coherence length \Gamma_{\xi} \sim 5.5 \pm 1.5 close to T_{c}. Our results suggest the presence of rather large thermal fluctuations and the existence of a vortex liquid phase over a broad temperature range (\sim 5 K large at 2 T).

The recent discovery of superconductivity at unusually high temperature (up to 56 K) in rare-earth iron oxypnictides [1, 2] has been the focus of a tremendous number of theoretical and experimental works in the past few months. The possible coexistence of superconductivity with a complex magnetic structure [3] makes this system particularly fascinating and a nonconventional pairing mechanism (associated with multigap superconductivity in electron and hole pockets) has been suggested by different groups [4]. In this context, it is very important to have a precise determination of the temperature dependence of the critical fields and corresponding anisotropies.

We will focus on the superconducting properties of the NdFeAs(O,F) compound [5]. The aim of this Rapid Communication is to present combined Hall-probe magnetization and specific-heat (C_{p}) measurements performed on Nd-doped single crystals. A superconducting anomaly was clearly visible in C_{p} around 35 K and, as previously observed in high-T_{c} oxides, this anomaly is symmetric and broad and rapidly collapses as the magnetic field is increased. On the other hand, the lower critical field presents a classical temperature dependence for both H_{a}\|c and H_{a}\|ab [with H_{c1}^{c}(0) \sim 120 \pm 30 G and H_{c1}^{c} \sim 40 \pm 10 G] and the anisotropy of the penetration depth remains on the order of 4 on the entire temperature range. A similar anisotropy is obtained for the upper critical field from the C_{p} measurements.

NdFeAs(O,F) samples have been synthesized at high pressure in a cubic multitail apparatus. More details of the synthesis are given elsewhere [6]. Both Hall-probe magnetization and C_{p} measurements have been performed on the same plateletlike single crystals extracted from the polycrystalline batch [with dimensions of \sim 100 \times 100 \times 30 \mum^{3} (sample 1), \sim120 \times 80 \times 30 \mum^{3} (sample 2), and \sim170 \times 100 \times 50 \mum^{3} (sample 3)].

The local magnetization of the platelet has been measured by placing the sample on the top of an array of miniature Hall probes of dimensions 4 \times 4 or 8 \times 8 \mum^{2}. The ac trans-mittivity (T_{\rm ac}^{\prime}, related to the _local susceptibility_) has been measured by applying a small (\sim 1 G) a field and recording the corresponding response of the probe as a function of the temperature [see Fig. 1(a)]. T_{\rm ac}^{\prime} is obtained by subtracting the response in the normal state from the data and is rescaled to -1 at T = 4.2 K (due to the small but nonzero distance between the probe and the sample surface, about 10% of the external field is still picked up by the probe in the superconducting state). As shown in Fig. 1(a), the transmittivity measured in the center of the sample first presents a small paramagnetic increase starting at \sim37 K followed by a sharp diamagnetic jump at T \sim 34 K (sample 1). This paramagnetic bump (also observed in zero-field-cooled dc measurements) reflects a nonhomogeneous distribution of the field [7] between 34 and 37 K. However, the presence of a clear anomaly in the specific heat emphasizes the overall good quality of the platelets. A similar bump has been observed in sample 2 between 34.5 and 37.5 K and in sample 3 between 36.5 and 37.5 K. Note also that previous global magnetization measurements [8] yield no onset of the diamagnetic response of the polycrystalline batch around T \sim 51 K, in agreement with a resistivity T_{c} on the order of 50 K for optimally doped samples [5]. We did not find any sign of superconductivity around 51 K in our platelets, indicating that the diamagnetic response observed above 40 K in global statements is due to a distribution of T_{c} values (i.e., F content) within the polycrystalline batch.

Specific-heat measurements have been performed on the same crystallites (samples 1 and 2) using an ac technique. This high-sensitivity technique (typically 1 part in 10^{4}) is very well adapted to measuring C_{p} of very small samples. Heat was supplied to the sample at a frequency \omega = 10 Hz by a light-emitting diode via an optical fiber. The temperature oscillations have been recorded with a thermocouple which has been calibrated from measurements on ultrapure silicon. The superconducting contribution to the specific heat (\Delta C_{p}) has been obtained by subtracting the curve at \mu_{0}H_{a}= 7 T  (for H_{a}|c) from the curves obtained for lower fields as well as a (H_{a}/T)^{2} contribution to account for the presence of a magnetic background. As shown in Fig. 1(b) (sample 1), there is no sharp discontinuity at T_{c} and the anomaly has the shape of a rounded peak with a height on the order of a few 10^{-3} of the total specific heat. The other striking behavior is the influence of the magnetic field. As previously observed in cuprates,[9] the smearing of the anomaly with field is unexpectedly strong with an almost field-independent onset. The maximum of C_{p} is pushed downward in temperature by the field with a characteristic average slope on the order of -2 T/K for H_{a}|c and -7 T/K for H_{a}|ab (compared to -1.5 and -9 T/K, respectively, in optimally doped YBaCuO; note that the shift is possibly nonlinear for small magnetic field and see solid line in Fig. 2 and discussion below). As in cuprates, the shape of the anomaly precludes any precise determination of H_{c2}. However, assuming that H_{c2} is close to the maximum of C_{p} (H_{\rm max}) and taking the corresponding linear temperature dependence, we hence get H_{c2}(0)\!\sim\!0.7\times\!dH_{\rm max}/dT\!\times\!T_{c}\!\sim\!40 and \sim170 T for H_{a}|c and H_{a}|ab, respectively. The corresponding anisotropy of the coherence length \Gamma_{\xi}\!=\!\xi_{c}/\xi_{ab}\!=\!\Gamma_{H_{c2}} is hence on the order of H_{c2}^{ab}(0)/H_{c2}^{c}(0)\!\sim\!4. The uncertainty on the H_{c2} values is rather large but \Gamma_{\xi} can also be estimated from the total shape of the anomaly.

  of the anomaly, writing \Delta C(\Gamma_{\xi}\!\times\!H_{a}\!\parallel\!ab)\!\sim\!\Delta C(H_{a}\! \parallel\!c), consistently leading to \Gamma_{\xi}\!\sim\!5.5\!\div\!1.5. This value is also in good agreement with the one previously reported by Welp _et al._[10] and with recent band-structure calculations.[11]

The influence of H_{a} on the C_{p} anomaly and its overall shape is strikingly different from the one observed in classical superconductors or even in the (K, Ba)BiO_{3} system (T_{c}\!\sim\!32 K) (Ref. [12]) or MgB_{2} (T_{c}\!\sim\!39 K) (Ref. [13]) of similar T_{c} values. It is tempting to attribute these deviations to fluctuation effects. To reinforce this idea, it is worth noting that the onset of the diamagnetic response well coincides with the inflection point of the C_{p} anomaly for H_{a}\!=\!0 but is pushed toward substantially lower temperature in field (\sim\!5 K lower than the C_{p} shift for \mu_{0}H_{a}\!\!=\!2 T). As T_{ac}^{\infty} is sensitive to pinning, this result suggests that the irreversibility line is well separated from the superconducting transition for H_{a}\!\neq\!0 (see inset of Fig. 2(b) for H_{a}\!\parallel\!c; a similar result--not shown--is obtained for H_{a}\!\parallel\!ab), supporting the idea of an extended vortex liquid phase. The importance of thermal fluctuations can be quantified by the Ginzburg number [14]G_{i}\!=\!(k_{B}T_{c}/\epsilon_{0}\xi_{c})^{2}/8, where \epsilon_{0}\! [=\!(\Phi_{0}/4\pi\omega_{ab})^{2}] is the line tension of the vortex matter. Large \lambda values (see below) combined with small \xi values hence lead here to \epsilon_{0}\xi_{c}\!\sim\!200 K (i.e., similar to cuprates) compared to \sim\!1000 K in (K, Ba)BiO_{3} and even \sim\!10^{4} in MgB_{2}. Although smaller than in cuprates due to smaller T_{c} values, thermal fluctuations are hence expected to play a role in this system possibly leading to the melting of the vortex solid (G_{i}\!\sim\!3\!\times\!10^{-3}\!-\!10^{-2}). A similar conclusion was drawn by Welp _et al._[10] Note that, as expected for vortex melting, the irreversibility line clearly presents a positive curvature [H_{\rm irr}\!\propto\!(1\!-\!T/T_{c})^{\alpha} with \alpha\!\sim\!1.5; for a review see Ref. [14]]. Similarly, thermal fluctuations may also induce an upward curvature in the H_{c2} line [15] but even though our data suggest the existence of such a curvature (see also Ref. [10]), we cannot unambiguously conclude given the uncertainties and limited temperature range of the C_{p} data.

The first penetration field H_{p} has been deduced by measuring the remanent field (B_{\rm rem}) in the sample after applying an external field H_{a} and sweeping the field back to zero. For H_{a}\!<\!H_{p} no vortices penetrate the sample and the remanent field remains equal to zero. H_{a} is progressively increased until a finite remanent field is obtained as vortices remain pinned in the sample for H_{a}\!>\!H_{p} [B_{\rm rem} increasing as (H_{a}\!-\!H_{p})^{2}; see solid line in the inset of Fig. 1(a)]. Theoretically speaking, H_{p} is expected to depend on the position of the probe, being larger in the center of the sample as vortices first remain pinned close to sample edges. However, experimentally, a nonzero B_{\rm rem} value could be detected almost simultaneously on all the probes due to the nonzero distance between the sample and the probe. Note that we did not observe any significant change in the B_{\rm rem}(H_{a}) curve up to H_{a}\!\sim\!3H_{p} as the magnetic field was tilted away from the c axis (with an angle \theta_{H_{a}}\!\leq\!60^{\circ}\!-\!70^{\circ}). Even though the angle between the internal field (\theta_{H}) and the c axis is reduced by the demagnetization effects, this surprising behavior suggests that the induction (B) in the sample remains perpendicular to the platelets up to large \theta_{H} values [see inset of Fig. 1(a) for sample 1 at \theta_{H_{a}}\!=\!7^{\circ} and 55^{\circ}]. B_{\rm rem} finally decreases with \theta for H_{a}\!\geq\!3H_{p} (and/or for \theta_{H_{a}}\!\geq\!70^{\circ}), indicating that the vortices finally align on the applied field for large H_{a} (and/or \theta_{H_{a}}) values.

In samples with rectangular cross sections, flux lines partially penetrate into the sample through the sharp corners even for H_{a}\!<\!H_{p} (Refs. [16, 17]) but remain "pinned" at the sample equator. The magnetization at H_{a}\!=\!H_{p} is then larger than H_{c1} and the standard "elliptical" correction for H_{c1} [=\!H_{p}/(1\!-\!N), where N is the demagnetization factor] cannot be used anymore. Following Ref. [16], in the presence of geometrical barriers, H_{p} is related to H_{c1} through H_{c1} \approx\!H_{p}/\!\tanh(\sqrt{ad/2w}), where \alpha varies from 0.36 in strips to 0.67 in disks (2w and d being the sample width and thickness, respectively). Taking an average \alpha value of \sim\!0.5,[18] we hence got[19]H_{c1}^{\prime}(0)\!\sim\!110\!\div\!20 G in sample 1, H_{c1}^{\prime}(0)\!\sim\!100\!\div\!20 G in sample 2, and H_{c1}^{\prime}(0)\!\sim\!140\!\div\!30 G in sample 3. To obtain H_{p} in the ab plane, sample 3 has been rotated by 90^{\circ} putting the probe on the small side of the sample [i.e., applying H_{a} along the long direction of the sample so that H_{p}^{\prime\prime\prime}(0)\!\sim\!H_{c1}^{\rm ob}]. We hence obtained H_{c1}^{\rm ob}\sim\!40\!\div\!10 G (in sample 3).

The temperature dependence of H_{c1} for both H_{a}\!\parallel\!c (samples 1 and 3; the data for sample 1 have been rescaled by a factor of 1.5) and H_{a}\!\parallel\!ab (sample 3) is displayed in Fig. 3. As shown, H_{c1}^{\prime} clearly flattens off at low temperatures (down to 1.6 K for sample 1), indicating that the gap is fully open in our NdAsFe(O,Fe) single crystals. This result is in striking contrast with H_{p} measurements in Ref. [21], which suggested that H_{c1} varies linearly at low temperature in LaFeAs(O,F), hence suggesting the existence of gapless su

Figure 3: Temperature dependence of the lower critical field H_{c1} along the c direction (solid squares for sample 3 and solid lozenges for sample 1, rescaled by a factor of 1.5) and ab plane for sample 3 (solid circles). The solid lines are the standard behaviors expected from the BCS theory. The corresponding temperature dependence of the anisotropy (\Gamma_{\lambda}\!=\!1.3\!\times\!\Gamma_{H_{c1}}) is also reported (open squares). The error bars correspond to the uncertainties on the determination of H_{p}; the whole curve might be shifted \pm\!1.5 due to the uncertainty of the demagnetization factor. In all cases, \Gamma_{\lambda} remains flat in T. The \Gamma_{\xi} values deduced from C_{p} (present work: open circles; Ref. [10]; open lozenge) and transport (Ref. [27]; open triangles) measurements are also displayed.

  perconductivity. On the other hand, a very similar temperature dependence [and H_{c1}(0) values] was recently obtained by Okazaki _et al.[22]_ in Pr-doped samples.

The lower critical field is related to the penetration depth through H_{c1}^{c}\!=\!\Phi_{0}^{2}/(4\pi\lambda_{ab}^{2})[Ln(\kappa)\!+\!c(\kappa)], where \kappa\!\!=\!\!\lambda_{ab}/\xi_{ab} (\xi being the coherence length) and c(\kappa) is a \kappa-dependent function tending toward \sim\!\!0.5 for large \kappa values. Taking H_{c2}^{c}(0)\!\sim\!40 T, one gets \lambda_{ab}(0)\!\sim\!270\!\pm\!40 nm.[23] Those \lambda values are consistent with those previously obtained in oxypnictides. Indeed, slightly lower \lambda_{ab} values (\sim\!200 nm) have been reported in both Sm- and Nd-doped samples with higher T_{c} (\sim\!50 K, from either torque,[20] muon relaxation,[24] or plasma frequency[25] measurements), whereas \lambda\sim\!360\!-\!390 nm have been obtained in La-doped samples with lower T_{c} values [\sim\!23 K (Refs. [21] and [26]].

For H||ab, H_{c1}^{ab}\!=\!\Phi_{0}^{2}/(4\pi\lambda_{ab}\lambda_{c})[Ln(\kappa^{*})\!+\! c(\kappa^{*})], with \kappa^{*} =\lambda_{c}/\xi_{ab}, and H_{c2}^{c}\!=\!\Phi_{0}^{2}/(2\pi\xi_{ab}\xi_{ab})\!\sim\!170 T, leading to \lambda_{c} \sim\!1200\!\pm\!200 nm and a corresponding anisotropy (\Gamma_{\lambda}) on the order of 4.0 (\pm 1.5), almost temperature independent down to 1.6 K (see Fig. 3, sample 3, \Gamma_{\lambda}\!\!=\!\Gamma_{H_{c1}}\times\{1+Ln(\Gamma_{\lambda})/[Ln(\kappa)\!+\!0.5]\}\!\sim\!1.3\times\Gamma_{H_{c1}}). Note that our data are in striking contrast with those deduced from torque measurements in Sm-doped samples[20] which led to strongly increasing \Gamma_{\lambda} values, exceeding 30 at low temperature. On the other hand, our \Gamma_{\lambda} consistently tends toward \Gamma_{\xi} for T\!\!\to\!T_{c} deduced either from C_{p} (present work and Ref. [10]) or transport data.[27] The difference between the anisotropies measured at low (\Gamma_{\lambda}) and high (\Gamma_{\xi}) fields remains within our error bars and we hence cannot comment on a possible similarity with MgB_{2} in which the coexistence of two gaps leads to a strong field and temperature dependence of the anisotropy.[28]

In conclusion, specific heat and Hall-probe magnetization data suggest that \Gamma_{\xi}\!\sim\!\Gamma_{\lambda}\!\sim\!5\!\pm\!2 in NdFeAs(F,O) single crystals. Whereas the irreversibility rapidly shifts toward lower temperature for increasing H_{o}, the C_{p} anomaly collapses and shows only a minor shift, suggesting the presence of strong thermal fluctuations possibly leading to the melting of the vortex solid.
