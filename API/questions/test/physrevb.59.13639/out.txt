###### Abstract

Partially substituted YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (Y123) samples are produced by replacing part of the Y with appropriate rare-earth elements and/or part of the Ba with Sr. Partial substitution has little effect on the normal-state resistivity or superconducting transition temperature, but should reduce the phonon part of the thermal conductivity, _l_p . Ambient temperature measurements on several polycrystalline samples show a thermal conductivity, l, reduction relative to Y123. The effect persists to lower temperatures and data for Y123 and Y0.5Yb0.5Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ show that the l peak at _T_c/2 is also affected. [S0163-1829(99)03918-1]

## Introduction

Several studies [1-3] have shown that the thermal conductivity l of YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (Y123) does not undergo a sudden change at the superconducting transition temperature _T_c , and reaches a maximum at roughly _T_c/2. The two explanations that have been proposed for this behavior are (a) enhancement of the phonon conductivity due to the disappearance of phonon scattering by the unpaired electrons and (b) electronic energy transport at temperatures well below _T_c . At present the electronic-transport mechanism that is based on _d_-wave superconductivity [4-8] appears to be more generally accepted.

In a recently published study [9] of the thermal conductivity of YBa2Cu4O8 (Y124) we suggested that both electrons and phonons make significant contributions to the l of superconducting Y124 and Y123. For Y123, it seemed that the relative roles of phonons and electrons might be experimentally identified by making l measurements on partially substituted Y123. The purpose of this paper is to report l measurements on several Y123 materials in which Sr replaces some of the Ba and Dy or Yb replaces some of the Y. In particular, the measurements on Y0.5Yb0.5Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ show that interesting low-temperature effects can be produced by partial substitution.

## Sample preparation and properties

The polycrystalline Y123 and partially substituted Y123 samples were prepared by mixing and grinding the oxides, firing in oxygen at 950 degC, regrinding to form a sinternable powder that was then pressed into pellets and sintered at 950 degC. Phase purity, as determined by x-ray diffraction was generally greater than 99% and carbon contents as low as 80 ppm were obtained. Examination by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive x-ray analysis showed that, at least to the scale of 1 _m_m, the samples were solid solutions. Density and room-temperature resistivity values for the samples are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Resistivity data obtained before and after the l measurements were obtained show that the samples degraded in the vacuum environment. Resistivity-temperature data obtained after the low-temperature l measurements are shown in Fig. 1. These results showed zero resistance _T_c values of 89 and 87.2 K for Y123 and Y0.5Yb0.5Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ Descriptions of the two thermal conductivity measurement devices that were employed have been presented previously. [9,10]

## Experimental results

Ambient temperature l data for five partially substituted Y123 samples are shown in Fig. 2. Data for three Y123 samples [11] are included for comparison. Barium carbonate was used to prepare these samples and carbon contents were typically 800-1500 ppm. The best sample [2] contained a slight excess of Ba, 2.005. Excess Ba lowers the resistivity of Y123. Lower-temperature data for Y123 and Y0.5Yb0.5Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ are shown in Fig. 3. Data from the cut-bar l apparatus are included in Fig. 3. The results for two measurements on samples from different batches of partially substituted Y123 differ by 4%.

## Discussion

The data presented in Fig. 2 show that partial substitution reduces both the magnitude and temperature dependence of the l. The resistivities of these samples varied from 638 to 1100x10-8 O m, but the l data do not show much correlation with resistivity. This indicates that the phonon l component _l_p dominates. Using the Sommerfeld-Lorenz number L_{o} to make a correction for the electronic component _l_e , yields estimates of _l_p for Y123 and the partially substituted samples.

At 295 K, the average _l_p value for Y123 is 2.73

 W m-1 K-1 (+-3%). This agreement shows that the variation in l values for the three samples is probably due to differences in the electronic component. Calculation of l_p_ for the sample prepared from BaO yields a value at least 10% greater than the average value for the three carbonate process samples. For the partially substituted samples the l_p_ values are 10-30 % lower. Presumably this reduction is associated with phonon-point defect scattering but it should be noted that the reduction does not correlate very well with composition. The largest l_p_ reduction was observed for DyBa14Sr06Cu3O7-_ph_

The lower-temperature l data are shown in Fig. 3. The l values for Y123 reach a maximum at 0.3_T__c_ and the maximum has usually been observed at about 0.5_T__c_.2,3 Also, our maximum l value is about twice as large as the earlier results. Our apparatus was tested by making measurements on a NIST9 standard, so there is not much reason to doubt their validity. One explanation for this difference is that we had a better (lower carbon) sample than those available to earlier investigators. Previous studies on both metallic elements and insulating compounds have shown that the l maximum can increase and shift to lower temperatures as the defect concentration is reduced. Our results on Y124 (Ref. 9) also seem to show this behavior.

The Yb for Y partial substitution reduces the maximum l by ~50% and the maximum value occurs at ~0.5_T__c_. One explanation for this reduction is that point-defect scattering persists to low temperatures, which requires a low characteristic temperature. An analysis9 of the l data for Y123 suggests that this may be the case. The l_p_ estimates shown in Fig. 4 also suggest a low characteristic temperature and strong point-defect scattering. These l_p_ estimates were obtained by correcting for electronic transport by using the resistivity data shown in Fig. 1 with L_{o}. For Y0.5Yb0.5Ba2Cu3O7-_ph_ the result is that l_p_ is reduced relative to Y123 and the temperature dependence becomes weaker. Callaway's model12 predicts this kind of behavior. Extrapolating this two-component description of the normal-state data down to ~50 K yields l values that agree with the experimental data. The l_e_ estimates fall slowly as the temperature is lowered and they were graphically extrapolated to ~50 K. The l_p_ extrapolations were based on Fig. 4.
