REVIEW B **84**, 020513(R) (2011)

Discovery of a Fe-based superconductor in 2008 raised a fundamental
question about the pairing symmetry of its superconductivity (SC).[1, 2]
In the compound, fully gapped multiband superconductivity has been
realized, according to NMR,[3] angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy,[4] London penetration depth meserments,[5] and muon spin
rotation, relaxation and resonance (μSR) studies.[6] Several independent
groups theoretically predicted a sign-reversal s-wave model (s_(±) wave)
for the SC,[2] and recent half-flux quantum experiments on
NdFeAsO_(0.88)F_(0.12) supported the model.[7] Meanwhile, a
non-sign-reversal s-wave model (s_(+ϕ) wave) was proposed to account for
the hump structure observed in neutron-scattering measurements below
T_(c).[8] The s₊₊-wave model is highly developed and is competitive with
the s_(±)-wave model.[9, 10, 11] In addition, a d-wave model is still
competing with the s₊₊- and s_(±)-wave models.[12]

The s₊₊ and s_(±) waves share the same sign for the hole-Fermi pockets
but not for the electron-Fermi pockets. The d-wave state has opposite
signs for the nearest-neighbor electron-Fermi pockets. Because
nonmagnetic impurity (NMI) causes pair breaking in different ways
depending on the pairing symmetry, the NMI study is expected to greatly
help to answer the open question.[13, 14, 15, 16] Anderson’s theorem
predicts that a NMI does not break pairing in an isotropic
non-sign-reversal SC state but does in an anisotropic state.[16] The
theorem describes well the results for the cuprate superconductor, which
quickly loses the SC by a small amount of NMI.[13]

Since Zn²⁺ has a tightly closed d shell, a doped Zn normally works as a
better NMI. A few atomic percentage points of Zn in fact act as a strong
scattering center in a superconductor, though it has little influence on
the magnetism and transport properties.[13, 14, 15] Because the doped Zn
actually plays a crucial role of the pairing symmetry determination, we
may expect that it works as well in the Fe-based superconductor. In
early studies, Cheng _et al_. reported that the doped Zn hardly affects
the SC of the p-type Ba_(0.5)K_(0.5)Fe₂As₂,[1] and Li _et al_. reports
the same for the n-type LaFeAsO_(0.85)F_(0.15).[18] However, the SC is
completely suppressed by at most 3 at.

Recently, we succeeded in doping a large amount of Zn into a crystal of
BaFe_(1.89 − 2x)Co_(0.11)As₂ (T_(c) = 25 K) using a high-pressure and
high-temperature heating method. Magnetic and electrical properties of
the Zn-doped crystal indicate a notable T_(c) decrease in proportional
to the Zn content. Because early studies showed smaller T_(c) decreases
(except for Ref. [19]), the T_(c) decrease is remarkable. Thus, it is
significant to investigate the role of Zn in the crystals of
BaFe_(1.89 − 2x)Zn_(2x)Co_(0.11)As₂ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.08).

The nominal composition of the crystals was
BaFe_(1.87 − 2x)Zn_(2x)Co_(0.13)As₂ (x = 0-0.07); mixtures of BaAs
(prepared as in Ref. [19]), FeAs (Ref. [19]), Fe (99.9

The crystal structure was investigated by powder x-ray diffraction
(XRD). The tetragonal ThCr₂Si₂-type structure was found to form over the
compositions from x = 0 to 0.08 without traces of impurities.[22] The
lattice constants were estimated from analysis of the XRD patterns
(Table 2); a nearly isotropic expansion of both a and c was found,
reflecting difference between the Zn-As and the Fe-As bonds as discussed
in Ref. [18]. In addition, a magnetic effect is possibly included in the
c-axis expansion.[23] In addition, a shining surface of the platelike
crystal (∼0.5 mm long) was studied by XRD (Fig. 1). An orientation
toward [0 0 2_n_] (_n_ is integer) is obvious, indicating that the c
axis is perpendicular to the crystal plane.[24] The Zn substitution was
again confirmed in an electron probe microanalysis (EPMA, JXA-8500F;
JEOL) conducted on the surface (Table 1). The Co content is almost
constant at ∼0.11 over the compositions, while the Zn content
monotonically increases with increasing x. Hereafter, the crystals are
labeled as BaFe_(1.89 − 2_(x))Zn_(2.2)Co_(0.11)As₂ with x = 0, 0.01,
0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.07, and 0.08. Note that the high-pressure
method was probably essential to overcoming the difficulties regarding
the Zn doping.

We attempted to measure the magnetic susceptibility (χ) of an individual
crystal; however, accurate measurements were not achieved. Thus, we
loosely gathered crystals into a sample holder (∼30 mg each composition)
in a magnetic properties measurement system, Quantum Design, for an
alternative measurement. Figure 2 shows temperature dependence of χ in a
magnetic field (H) of 10 Oe for the crystals of
BaFe_(1.89 − 2_(x))Zn_(2.2)Co_(0.11)As₂ (x = 0-0.08). The host crystal
(x = 0) was confirmed to show the SC transition at 25 K as reported.[22,
25] With increasing the Zn content, T_(c) monotonically decreases, and
the SC disappears at x = 0.08 (>2 K) (Table 1).

Each crystal was carefully cleaved to a thickness of approximately
20-100 μm along the c axis, and the ab-plane electrical resistivity (ρ)
was measured by a standard four-point method in a physical properties
measurement system, Quantum Design. Figure 3 shows T vs ρ for
BaFe_(1.89 − 2_(x))Zn_(2.2)Co_(0.11)As₂ (x = 0-0.08); T_(c) by ρ goes
down with increasing the Zn content as much as T_(c) by χ (Table 1).
This supports that the doped Zn is evenly distributed into the crystal
since T_(c) by ρ is rather sensitive to the surface matter. Note that
T_(c) by ρ was defined by a peak position of the dρ/dT curve (not
shown). Besides, we define the residual resistivity ρ₀ by extrapolation
of the linear part of T to zero temperature (the upturned region is
excluded). Because the upturn of the resistivity curve in the highly
Zn-doped crystals indicates the occurrence of localization, we tested
several definitions of ρ₀ to avoid influence of the upturn on the ρ₀
estimation. However, ρ₀ remained essentially large in any cases. The ρ₀
(Table 1) gradually increases with increasing Zn content at a rate of
∼76 μΩ cm/

The Hall coefficient ($R_{\rm H}$) at 150 K of the selected
BaFe_(1.89 − 2_(x))Zn_(2.2)Co_(0.11)As₂ crystals (x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, and

0.07) was measured in the same apparatus, where H was applied parallel
to the c axis. The data for the Zn-free crystal accesses the early data
(Table 1).[27] The $R_{\rm H}$ changes little over the Zn substitution,
reflecting the isoelectronic substitution of Zn for Fe. Thus, the net
carrier density change is unlikely responsible for the T_(c) decrease.

Since the potential for Zn impurity is very strong, the Zn impurity
works as the unitary scattering potential comparable to the bandwidth.
According to Ref. [8], the reduction in T_(c) due to strong impurity (J>
1 eV) in the s_(±)-wave state is ∼50×K/

To further study the T_(c) suppression, it is significant to calculate
the pair-breaking rate α = 0.88zΔρ₀/T_(c0) (βγ/2πk_(B)T_(c0)), where γ
is the electron scattering rate and T_(c0) is the T_(c) of the Zn-free
crystal. On basis of the five-orbital model for the 122 system, a
relation between γ and Δρ₀ was proposed as Δρ₀ (μΩ cm) = 0.18γ (K),
where Δρ₀ is the gap between ρ₀ with and without Zn. In this study, we
estimated α using z = 0.33 and 0.50(=α₁) as depicted in Fig. 4. To
obtain the elastic scattering rate, we also calculated α by deriving
γ = ne²Δρ₀/2m (≡α₂), where α is the carrier number estimated from the
Hall data. Both α₁ and α₂ data change in roughly linearly; α is thereby
estimated to be 7.64, 11.49, and 6.76 for α₁ (z = 0.33), α₁(z = 0.05),
and α₂, respectively. For the s_(±)-wave state, the SC is expected to
vanish in the range α > 0.22 (α^(±)_(c)),[8] which is remarkably much
lower than the experimental values. In addition, using the relation
α₃ = ℏ Δρ₀/4π T_(c)μ₀λ₀², we obtain α₃ = 2.58 for λ₀ = 195 nm,[5] which
is still very far from α^(±)_(c). Obviously, any pair-breaking parameter
for the present superconductor is too far from α^(±)_(c) to support the
s_(±)-wave model, indicating realization of the s₊₊-wave state.

It is possible that α₁, α₂, and α₃ are slightly overestimated if Δρ₀ is
overestimated due to influences from the grain boundaries and undetected
factors. For further clarification, we make additional estimates using
the critical impurity concentration for the s_(±)-wave state (n^(±)imp).
According to the discussion in Ref. [8], Zn (J> 1 eV) corresponds to
n^(±)imp ∼0.5/T_(c) (K). Thus, we predict n^(±)imp to be 0.01 (0.015)
for z = 0.5 (0.33); however, the experimentally determined $n_{\rm imp}$
of 0.08 (T_(c) = 0) is much higher than the theoretical values. Thus,
the discussion for n^(±)imp does not support the s_(±)-wave model for
BaFe_(1.89 − 2.5)Co_(0.11)As₂ either.

The pair-breaking parameters for the α-particle-irradiated
NdFeAs(O,F)[29] and the proton-irradiated Ba(Fe,Co)₂As₂[30] are larger
than 10n^(±)_(c) ( = 2.2) and 17α^(±)_(c) ( = 3.8), respectively,
implying that the s_(±)-wave model is unlikely for the superconductors.
Recent NMR studies on P-doped BaFe₂As₂[31] and theoretical studies on
the local structure of the Fe₂As₂ layer[32] suggest a possible change of
the gap symmetry depending on minute factors. Besides, a change from d
to s wave was predicted theoretically to depend on degree of
disorder.[33] To understand the pair-breaking effect comprehensively on
the Fe-based superconductor, additional Zn studies over varieties of the
Fe-based superconductors, including the 11, 111, 122, and 1111 systems,
would be helpful from ρ doped to n doped.

In summary, we studied the Zn doping effect on the T_(c) optimized
superconductor BaFe_(1.89 − 2.2)Co_(0.11)As₂ (T_(c) = 25 K). The highest
Zn level of 8 at.
