According to a straightforward Bean model analysis, this leads to a multiple peak structure in the _kh_' dependence, in contrast to a sharp single peak for a sample without grain boundaries. At the same time, the real part of the magnetic susceptibility _kh_' shows the shielding of the external magnetic field.\n\nThe temperature dependence of the real and the imaginary parts of the ac susceptibility for the crystals R28, R5, and R6, and the real part for R3 are shown in Fig. 1. The sharp drop of the magnetic moment for R5 and R6 shows the transition to the superconducting state at a temperature _T_c=30.9 K, which corresponds to that obtained from dc measurements. The width of the transition from 10% to 90% of the diamagnetic signal is about 0.9 K for R5 and 1.3 K for R6, which is very narrow and is the first evidence for a good sample quality. The peak in _m_'' is very sharp and close to the critical temperature. The sharpness of the peak shows that the specimen is a bulk superconductor with almost no weak links for supercurrent flow. There is still a small integrin peak in R5, compared to the main one, which can be observed at a temperature of about 24 K. We assume that the sample is mainly a bulk crystal with some amount of small grains.\n\nIn contrast to samples R5 and R6, samples R3 and R28 exhibit a much broader transition in _m_(_T_), R3 shows even two steps, which clearly indicates heavy granularity. As for R28, a complicated structure of _m_''(_T_) is observed. The same sharp peak as for R5 and R6 at _T_=_T_c, is also observed for R28. However, several other peaks can clearly be seen at lower temperatures. These peaks are attributed to dissipation due to weak links. Such granularity appears in the samples because of nonsuperconducting impurities (undoped C60 or most probably R x C60) between the superconducting grains.\n\nSummarizing the results for all three batches, "}

[1] These novel materials, still remaining _terra incognita_ for theoreticians and experimentalists, require vast efforts from both sides to achieve a progress in the understanding of their nature. One of the most important contributions that experimentalists can make to the development of a theory of any class of superconductors is revealing the magnitude and symmetry of the superconducting gap. Knowledge of the precise momentum dependence of the superconducting gap can provide desirable information about the pairing mechanism that underlies superconductivity in these compounds. Up to now there are a number of papers providing different estimates of the superconducting gap in iron-based superconductors.

The film growth was monitored by reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and the good crystallinity of the film was confirmed by the appearance of streak patterns. The deposited film was \\(c\\)-axis oriented, as measured by the x-ray-diffraction method. Only 2212 peaks were observable. The film thickness was 300 nm. The film was patterned into a junction, as shown in Fig. 1 in the following way. First, the Bi2212 film was patterned into a geometry with two holes by photolithography and a wet-etching process using HCl. Thereafter, the Au film was deposited and patterned by the lift-off technique. The critical temperature \\(T_{c}\\) and the critical current density \\(J_{c}\\) of the Bi2212 film at 4.2 K after microfabrication were 75 K and 106 A/cm2, respectively, ensuring the high quality of the Bi2212 film grown by the MBE method. The geometry of Fig. 1 was specially designed for studying the injection characteristics as well.\n\nThe measurements on the injection characteristics were performed by feeding the injection current through two tunnel barriers, as shown in Fig. 1, and measuring the change in the critical current of the Bi2212 film. The four-terminal method was employed in this measurement. The measurements of microwave detection were performed by a nonresonant superheterodyne-mixer technique with a receiver frequency of 47 GHz (bandwidth: \\(B\\) = 2 GHz).7 The generated microwave emission signal was guided to a tapered waveguide at the low-temperature section. The incident signal after passing through a modulator and an attenuator was mixed with a Schottky local oscillator si"}

This is the reason why mercury-bearing superconducting copper mixed oxides with general formulas of HgBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+2+\\delta} are attractive to the investigation of the relationship between structure and superconducting properties. These compounds have a remarkably high critical temperature and relatively simple crystal structures. The simplicity of their structures is caused by the absence of a mismatch between the layers of (CuO_{2}), (BaO), (Ca), and (HgO_{\\delta}) alternating along the c axis of the unit cell.[1] Moreover, the first member of the homologous series HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\\delta} (designated Hg-1201) has practically none of the layer stacking faults along the c axis existing in other members of the series2 that introduce systematic errors into the refinement of these layered structures based on diffraction data.

From the complex-frequency shift one can extract the complex conductivity \\bar{\\sigma} = \\sigma_{1}-i\\sigma_{2}; the emergence of \\sigma_{2} is the sign of the establishment of the coherent superconducting state. In Fig. 5 we have plotted the upper critical fields determined by the criterion that \\sigma_{2} exceeds 1% of the normal state \\sigma_{n}. The solid line is the plot of the following formula derived from Ginzburg-Landau theory:[20]\n\n\\[B_{c2}(T)=B_{c2}(0)\\frac{1-t^{2}}{1+t^{2}},\\] (2)\n\nwhere t=T/T_{0}, with T_{0}=23.0 K and B_{c2}(0)= 56 T. The slope of B_{c2}(T) near T_{c} [dB_{c2}(T)/dT] is -2.5 T/K; this value is substantially unaffected if a different criterion (percentage) for the onset of superconductivity from microwave measurements is adopted. We have neglected in the fit the points above T_{c}=23.7 K, which is the critical temperature as deduced from resistivity measurements. Taking these points into account (points that may possibly and only be a representative of crystallites with a slightly higher T_{c}) would lead to a somewhat smaller value of B_{c2} but more importantly to an underestimate of the slope of B_{c2}(T) near T_{c}.\n\nWe have also measured the field dependence of the complex-frequency shift at several constant temperatures. We could not observe the low-field signal changes that are typical of intergrain Josephson junctions. It therefore appears that the preparation of the sample under 1 GPa pressure resulted in a very compact granular structure. From this frequency shift the mixed state effective complex conductivity can be analytically extracted.

The relative robustness of SC and FM can be reflected by the superconducting critical temperature T_{\\text{sc}} and the (ferro)magnetic transition temperature T_{\\text{m}}. Materials with T_{\\text{sc}}>T_{\\text{m}} were earlier called \"ferromagnetic superconductors\" (FSCs) [1], and those with T_{\\text{m}}>T_{\\text{sc}} were then termed \"superconducting ferromagnets\" (SFMs) [4-6]. Generally, a ferromagnetic exchange field prevails over the intrinsic superconducting upper critical field H_{\\text{c2}}^{*} for T_{\\text{m}}\\leqslantT_{\\text{sc}}, hence SFMs are particularly rare. So far, examples of SFMs only include U-based germanides with spin-triplet SC [7] and ruthenocuprates with spin-singlet high-temperature SC [8], the second of which actually exhibits the coexistence with a canted antiferromagnetism. Note that the classification into FSCs and SFMs is meaningful for studying the way of coexistence of the two antagonistic phenomena [5,9].\n\nIn recent years, Eu-containing 122-type iron arsenides have earned a lot of interest owing to the intriguing interplay bet"}

The relative robustness of SC and FM can be reflected by the superconducting critical temperature \\(T_{\\text{sc}}\\) and the (ferro)magnetic transition temperature \\(T_{\\text{m}}\\). Materials with \\(T_{\\text{sc}}\\)\\(>\\)\\(T_{\\text{m}}\\) were earlier called \"ferromagnetic superconductors\" (FSCs) [1], and those with \\(T_{\\text{m}}\\)\\(>\\)\\(T_{\\text{sc}}\\) were then termed \"superconducting ferromagnets\" (SFMs) [4-6]. Generally, a ferromagnetic exchange field prevails over the intrinsic superconducting upper critical field \\(H_{\\text{c2}}^{*}\\) for \\(T_{\\text{m}}\\)\\(\\leqslant\\)\\(T_{\\text{sc}}\\), hence SFMs are particularly rare. So far, examples of SFMs only include U-based germanides with spin-triplet SC [7] and ruthenocuprates with spin-singlet high-temperature SC [8], the second of which actually exhibits the coexistence with a canted antiferromagnetism. Note that the classification into FSCs and SFMs is meaningful for studying the way of coexistence of the two antagonistic phenomena [5,9].\n\nIn recent years, Eu-containing 122-type iron arsenides have earned a lot o"}
