###### Abstract

Results of muon spin relaxation (\muSR) and neutron powder diffraction measurements on a reentrant superconductor Eu(Fe_{0.86}Ir_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} are presented. Eu(Fe_{0.86}Ir_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} exhibits superconductivity at T_{\rm{c}on}\approx 22.5 K competing with long range ordered Eu^{+2} moments below \approx18 K. A reentrant behavior (manifested by nonzero resistivity in the temperature range 10-17.5 K) results from an exquisite competition between the superconductivity and magnetic order. The zero field \muSR data confirm the long range magnetic ordering below T_{\rm{E}b}=18.7(2) K. The transition temperature is found to increase with increasing magnetic field in longitudinal field \muSR, which along with the neutron diffraction results, suggests the transition to be ferromagnetic. The neutron diffraction data reveal a clear presence of magnetic Bragg peaks below T_{\rm{E}b} which could be indexed with propagation vector \mathbf{k}=(0,0,0), confirming a long range magnetic ordering in agreement with \muSR data. Our analysis of the magnetic structure reveals an ordered magnetic moment of 6.29(5) \mu_{\rm{B}} (at 1.8 K) on the Eu atoms and they form a ferromagnetic structure with moments aligned along the c axis. No change in the magnetic structure is observed in the reentrant or superconducting phases and the magnetic structure remains same for 1.8 K \leqslantT\leqslantT_{\rm{E}b}. No clear evidence of structural transition or Fe moment ordering was found.

## I Introduction

The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in 2008 in doped AFe_{2}As_{2} (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) after the complete suppression of antiferromagnetic/spin density wave (SDW) transition triggered world-wide research interests in this class of materials [1, 2, 3, 4]. The occurrence of superconductivity was soon found in their magnetic analog, the K-doped EuFe_{2}As_{2}[5, 6]. EuFe_{2}As_{2} attracted special attention because of the additional opportunity of exploring the interplay and coexistence of magnetic order and superconductivity brought by the Eu^{+2} (S=7/2) local moments. Like AFe_{2}As_{2}, EuFe_{2}As_{2} also crystallizes in the same layered body-centered-tetragonal ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure (space group I4/mmm) and exhibits a structural and SDW transition at 190 K associated with the itinerant Fe moments [1, 6, 7, 8]. In addition, the Eu^{+2} moments order antiferromagnetically below 19 K with an A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure on Eu sublattice with the ordered Eu^{+2} moments aligned ferromagnetically in the ab plane and antiferromagnetically along the c axis [8]. The Fe^{+2} moments order antiferromagnetically along the orthorhombic a axis below the structural and SDW transition at 190 K [8]. The SDW transition is easily suppressed by partial substitutions at Eu, Fe, or As sites or by the application of external pressure leading to superconductivity that coexists with the long range ordering of Eu moments [5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].

The hole doping by partial K substitution for Eu was found to yield superconductivity in Eu_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} with T_{\rm{c}}\approx 33 K for Eu_{0.5}K_{0.5}Fe_{2}As_{2} coexisting with short range ordered Eu^{+2} moments below 15 K [5, 9]. The electron doping by partial Co substitution for Fe leads to reentrant superconductivity in Eu(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} with T_{\rm{c}}\approx 21 K and reentrant behavior below 17 K for x=0.11[10, 11]. However, no superconductivity is observed in Ni-doped Eu(Fe_{1-x}Ni_{x})_{2}As_{2}, even though the SDW transition is suppressed completely [16]. The substitution of Fe by Ni in the optimally hole-doped superconductor Eu_{0.5}K_{0.5}Fe_{2}As_{2} was found to lead to revival of SDW and Eu moment ordering in Eu_{0.5}K_{0.5}(Fe_{1-x}Ni_{x})_{2}As_{2}. [17]. The substitution of As by sequential or induces reentrant superconductivity in EuFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x}) with T_{\rm{c}}= 26 K and Eu magnetic order below 20 K for x=0.15[12, 13]. The application of pressure also leads to reentrant superconductivity with T_{\rm{c}}\sim 26 K at a pressure of around 2.5 GPa [14, 15].

The interests in these doped EuFe_{2}As_{2} were sparked because of the long-standing issues of the coexistence of long range magnetic order and superconductivity since such discoveries in rare earth borides and borocarbides [18, 19]. In order to understand the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity in these doped EuFe_{2}As_{2} it is essential to have the knowledge of their magnetic structure. The bulk properties measurements often give an initial idea of possible magnetic structures that needs to be verified by more specific tools such as neutron diffraction (ND) and synchrotron measurements. From the bulk properties measurements of Co-doped EuFe_{2}As_{2}, Jiang _et al._[10] proposed a helical magnetic structure for Eu(Fe_{0.86}Co_{0.11})_{2}As_{2} and Guguchia _et al._[11] proposed a canted antiferromagnetic structure for  Eu(Fe_{0.9}Co_{0.1})_{2}As_{2}. The magnetic structure determination by neutron diffraction study on Eu(Fe_{0.82}Co_{0.18})_{2}As_{2} revealed a ferromagnetic (FM) structure with the ordered Eu^{+2} moments directed along the c axis [20]. Contradictory antiferromagnetic versus ferromagnetic ground states were reported for P-doped EuFe_{2}As_{2} by Zapf _et al._[21, 22] and Nowik _et al._[23] respectively, from the bulk properties measurements and Mossbauer studies. Recent x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS) study by Nandi _et al._[24] reveal the magnetic structure of reentrant superconductor EuFe_{2}(As_{0.85}P_{0.15})_{2} to be ferromagnetic with Eu^{+2} moments aligned along the c axis. The ferromagnetic structure of Eu^{+2} moments was further confirmed from the neutron diffraction study on EuFe_{2}(As_{0.81}P_{0.19}) [25].

Recently some of us discovered reentrant superconductivity in Ir-doped EuFe_{2}As_{2}[26, 27]. Ir, though isoelectronic to Co, being a 5d transition metal benefits with an extended d orbital resulting in an increased hybridization and decreased Stoner enhancement factor, therefore the suppression of SDW in parent EuFe_{2}As_{2} is expected to be more effective with Ir doping. For the optimal Ir doping, in Eu(Fe_{0.86}To_{10.4})_{2}As_{2} the superconducting transition sets in at T_{\rm{co}}\approx 22.5 K and the long range ordering of Eu^{+2} moments is observed below \approx18 K coexisting with superconductivity [26, 27]. The reentrant behavior is reflected by a nonzero resistivity over 10-17.5 K caused by the ordering of Eu^{+2} moments as confirmed by the ^{151}Eu Mossbauer spectroscopy [27]. Investigations on single crystal Eu(Fe_{0.86}In_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} revealed evidence for anisotropic magnetic and superconducting properties, the superconducting diamagnetic signal is observed in magnetic susceptibility only for an applied field H\parallel c and not for H\perp c, though the ab-plane resistivity exhibits zero resistivity state [27]. Jiao _et al._ suggested the nature of magnetic ordering to be ferromagnetic in Eu(Fe_{0.88}Ir_{0.12})_{2}As_{2}[28]. Isoelectronic substitution of Fe by Ru is also reported to have ferromagnetic ordering of Eu moment in Eu(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2} coexisting with superconductivity [29]. The nonsuperconducting Eu(Fe_{1-x}Ni_{x})_{2}As_{2} also have ferromagnetic ground state for 0.03 \leq x\leq 0.[16].

The neutron diffraction study on Eu(Fe_{0.82}Co_{0.18})_{2}As_{2}[20] and EuFe_{2}(As_{0.81}P_{0.19})_{2}[25] provide clear evidence for the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity in these systems. While the coexistence of antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity is now perceived, the coexistence of ferromagnetic order and superconductivity which are antagonistic to each other is still puzzling and deserves microscopic investigations. In order to check the above inference of ferromagnetic ordering in Ir-doped EuFe_{2}As_{2} and find out whether the ferromagnetic nature of Eu-magnetic order is more general for the doped EuFe_{2}As_{2} or specific to the case of substitution of Fe by Co and of As by P we have determined the magnetic structure of reentrant superconductor Eu(Fe_{0.86}In_{0.14})_{2}As_{2}. Here we report our muon spin relaxation (\muSR) and neutron powder diffraction investigations on Eu(Fe_{0.86}In_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} and show that the nature of the long range magnetic order of Eu^{+2} moments is indeed ferromagnetic for Ir doping too.

Theoretically ferromagnetism has been suggested to coexist with superconductivity under certain conditions: (a) when the ferromagnetism is cryptoferromagnetic with multidomains such that the net magnetization is zero over the superconducting coherence length [30], (b) when ferromagnetism polarizes the Cooper pairs leading to an inhomogeneous superconductivity referred as Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinikov (FFLO) phase [31, 32], and (c) when a spontaneous-vortex phase is formed by the internal field of ferromagnetic order such that the combined energy of the coexisting phase is lowered [33]. Jiao _et al._ suggested the possibility of a spontaneous-vortex phase -and/or FFLO state for the coexistence of ferromagnetic order and superconductivity in Eu(Fe_{0.75}Ru_{0.25})_{2}As_{2}[29]. Nandi _et al._ suggested a spontaneous vortex in EuFe_{2}(As_{0.85}P_{0.15})_{2}[24]. The coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity in Eu(Fe_{0.86}In_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} may also have a similar mechanism.

In the following we present our results of \muSR and ND measurements on Eu(Fe_{0.86}In_{0.14})_{2}As_{2}. The zero field (ZF) \muSR results confirm the long range magnetic ordering below T_{\rm{Eu}}=18.7(2) K and the longitudinal field (LF) \muSR indicated the nature of long range order to be ferromagnetic. The neutron diffraction data allowed us to determine the magnetic structure, further supporting the ferromagnetic order below T_{\rm{Eu}}. The ordered Eu^{+2} moments lie along the tetragonal c axis with a magnetic propagation wave vector {\bf k}=(0,0,0). At 1.8 K the ordered state moment is found to be 6.29(5) \mu_{\rm{B}}. The \muSR or neutron diffraction data do not show any evidence for any change in magnetic structure in superconducting and reentrant phases.

## II Experimental Details

The polycrystalline sample of Eu(Fe_{0.86}In_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} was prepared by the solid state reaction method [26, 27] starting with the high purity elements (Eu: 99.9%, Fe: 99.999%, Ir: 99.99%, and As: 99.999%) in stoichiometric ratio. Fine pieces of Eu were mixed with Fe, Ir, and As powders, pelletized and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube and fired at 900^{\circ}C for 30 h. After the first firing the sample was thoroughly ground and again pelletized and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube. The sintering for 5 days at 900^{\circ}C yielded good quality sample as indicated by the powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) data.

The \muSR measurement was carried out at the ISIS facility of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Didcot, UK, using the EMU spectrometer both in zero field and in longitudinal fields up to 0.45 T. The powdered sample of Eu(Fe_{0.86}In_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} was mounted on a high purity silver plate using diluted GE varnish and covered with Kapton film. The low temperature was achieved by cooling the sample in a standard He-4 cryostat. In order to minimize the effect of the stray fields at the sample position the correction coils were used which ensured the stray field to be within 1 \muT. The zero-field \muSR data were collected in the temperature range 1.2 to 100 K, and LF data were collected at 1.4, 10, 18, and 35 K for fields up to 0.45 T.

The neutron diffraction measurements were carried out using the WISH time of flight diffractometer [34] at the ISIS Facility. The powdered Eu(Fe_{0.86}In_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} sample was lightly packed in a thin-walled vanadium can (diameter 3 mm) to reduce packing ratio and thereby absorption. The low temperature was achieved by cooling the sample inside a He-4 cryostat using He-exchange gas to ensure good thermal contact at low temperature. ND data were collected with long counting (4 h per run) at 1.8, 12, 16, and 25 K in order to determine magnetic structure as well as any change in magnetic structure with temperature. We also collected  data at several temperatures between 1.8 and 25 K with shorter counting time (30 min per point) to investigate the temperature dependence of order parameter. The refinement of neutron diffraction data was carried out using the Fullprof program [35].

## III Muon spin relaxation study

In order to shed light on the magnetic phase transitions seen in the zero-field resistivity of Eu(Fe_{0.86}Ir_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} below the superconducting transition T_{\rm c}\approx 21.5 K, we have investigated the temperature T dependence of the muon spin relaxation in zero-field (ZF), in applied longitudinal magnetic fields H=0.10 and 0.45 T, as well as H dependence at T=10 and 18 K. Figure 1 shows the \muSR asymmetry spectra of Eu(Fe_{0.86}Ir_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} at few representative temperatures between 1.2 and 50 K collected in zero field while warming the sample. For T\gtrsim 20 K, the \muSR spectra exhibit a typical behavior expected from the fluctuating paramagnetic moments with full initial asymmetry of 20% at 100 K. At T<20 K a loss (\sim2/3 at 1.2 K) in the initial asymmetry is clearly seen which is an indication of a long range magnetic ordering. Furthermore, the absence of asymmetry-time oscillations indicates that the ordered state moments are too large to be observed in the time windows of the EMU spectrometer.

The ZF \muSR spectra were fitted using a Lorentzian (also called exponential function) decay,

\[G_{z}(t,H)=A_{0}\exp(-\lambda t)+A_{\rm BG},\] (1)

where A_{0} is the initial asymmetry parameter, \lambda is the electronic relaxation rate mainly arising from the local moments, and A_{\rm BG} is a nonrelaxing constant background from the silver sample holder. The A_{\rm BG} was estimated from the 100 K ZF data and was kept fixed for the rest of the analysis. The fits of the \muSR data by the relaxation function in Eq. (1) are shown by the solid curves in Fig. 1. Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of parameters A_{0} and \lambda obtained from the fits of the ZF \muSR spectra for 1.2\leqslant T\leqslant 100 K. It is seen from Fig. 2(a) that the initial asymmetry A_{0} starts decreasing as T is lowered below 24 K and exhibits a sharp drop below 20 K. At low TA_{0} is only 1/3 of its high temperature value, i.e., there is a drop in A_{0} by 2/3 of its high-T value, which confirms the bulk nature of the long range magnetic ordering in Eu(Fe_{0.86}Ir_{0.14})_{2}As_{2}. Furthermore, \lambda increases with decreasing temperature below 100 K and exhibits a peak near 19 K, which is due to the long range magnetic ordering. The absence of any additional anomaly both in A_{0} and \lambda below 19 K, indicates that there is only one magnetic phase transition at T_{\rm Eu}\approx 19 K which is probed by muon spin relaxation. Thus we do not see a reentrant feature in \muSR.

It is interesting to note from Fig. 2(a) that the magnetic volume fraction of the sample is close to 100%. The superconducting volume fraction has also been found to be nearly 100% from the magnetic susceptibility measurements on Eu(Fe_{0.86}Ir_{0.14})_{2}As_{2}[26, 27]. This suggests that the whole volume of the sample participates in both magnetic ordering and superconductivity.

Though \lambda is not a strict order parameter, it is a measure of spatial correlation length \xi and can give an idea of critical dynamics: \lambda\sim\xi^{3/2} for a ferromagnet and \lambda\sim\xi^{1/2} for an antiferromagnet, whereas \xi\sim(T/T_{\rm tr}-1)^{-\omega} in the close vicinity of the transition temperature T_{\rm tr}[36, 37, 38]. The T dependence of \lambda could be described well by the critical exponent behavior \lambda(T)=\lambda_{0}|1-T/T_{\rm Eu}|^{-\omega}[38, 39, 40] for both T<T_{\rm Eu} and T>T_{\rm Eu}. For a three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnet (neutron diffraction data in the next section reveal a 3D ferromagnetism in the present compound) the exponent w\approx v(z-1)\approx 1.05 with exponents v\approx 0.70 and z=5/2[38, 40, 41]. The fits of \lambda(T) are shown by the solid curves in

The solid curves in (b) are the fits to critical exponent behavior \lambda(T)=\lambda_{0}|1-T/T_{\rm Eu}|^{-\omega}.

  Fig. 2(b). For T<T_{\rm Eu} a good fit is obtained for fit parameters \lambda_{0}=0.039(2)\mus^{-1}, T_{\rm Eu}=18.7(2) K, and w=1.20(6) from fitting over 1.2\leqslant T\leqslant 18 K. Whereas for T>T_{\rm Eu} the fit parameters are \lambda_{0}=0.94(2)\mus^{-1}, T_{\rm Eu}=18.0(5) K, and w=0.28(2) for fit over 20\leqslant T\leqslant 100 K. It is seen that for T<T_{\rm Eu} we obtain exponent w=1.20(6) which is close to the expected value of w\approx 1.05 for a 3D ferromagnet. A similar value of the exponent w=1.06(9) is reported for the ferrimagnet Cu_{2}OSeO_{3} which was obtained from the fit of \lambda(T) in the paramagnetic state (T>T_{\rm c}) [42]. However, for T>T_{\rm Eu} we see that the exponent w is much lower than the expected value. Even for the fitting range close to T_{\rm Eu} in T\leqslant 1.3T_{\rm Eu} there is no gain in w. This deviation possibly could be due to the muon-lattice dipolar interaction which is known to strongly affect the paramagnetic critical dynamics near the transition temperature of a ferromagnet [38, 40]. Efforts have been made in past to determine the T dependence of \lambda in the critical regime of dipolar Heisenberg ferromagnets using the mode coupling (MC) theory [36, 38, 43, 44]. Within the MC theory the effect of dipolar interactions is accounted for by the splitting of magnetic fluctuations into longitudinal and transverse modes in the reciprocal space, and the relative weight of transverse and longitudinal modes determines the critical \lambda(T) behavior. Unfortunately we do not have all the necessary ingredients for the calculation of MC theory prediction for our compound. We compare our results with the MC theory prediction for the 3D Heisenberg ferromagnet EuO [38, 45]. From Fig. 2(b) we see that there is a noticeable rise in \lambda, as the temperature is lowered from 50 K towards T_{\rm Eu} with a maximum value of \lambda\approx 2\mus^{-1} near T_{\rm Eu}. This value is very small compared to the MC theory calculated critical value of \sim12 \mus^{-1}[38], but very close to the experimental value of \lambda\approx 2\mus^{-1} for EuO near T_{\rm c}=70 K [45].

The LF \muSR measurements in H=0.10 and 0.45 T were done to understand the nature of the magnetic phase transition at T_{\rm Eu}\approx 19 K. The H=0.10 and 0.45 T LF \muSR data at various T were also fitted by the relaxation function in Eq. (1), thus yielding the T and H dependent fit parameters. The LF \muSR data at selected temperatures and their fits are shown in. Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). The T dependence of the fit parameters A_{0} and \lambda obtained for H=0.10 and 0.45 T are shown in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d) and compared with the ZF A_{0}(T) and \lambda(T). It is seen from Fig. 3(c) that while at H=0.10 T the LF A_{0}(T) is nearly similar to ZF A_{0}(T), at H=0.45 T there is a small increase in A_{0}. A substantial influence of field is observed on the T dependence of \lambda [Fig. 3(d)]. At H=0.10 T the peak height of \lambda is decreased and at H=0.45 T the peak in \lambda(T) almost disappears. Furthermore, at H=0.45 T the drop in the \lambda(T) starts at a temperature around 25 K compared to 19 K for ZF. This indicates that at H=0.45 T the transition temperature has increased to 25 from 19 K, thus revealing a ferromagnetic nature of the phase transition at T_{\rm Eu}\approx 19 K as deduced from the neutron diffraction data in the next section.

In Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) we show the LF \muSR asymmetry spectra of Eu(Fe_{0.86}Ir_{0.14})As_{2} at different fields at T=10 and 18 K. It is seen that the initial asymmetry increases with increasing field. While the increase in initial asymmetry is very weak at 10 K, the increase is significant at 18 K, increases by almost a factor of 2 at 0.45 T. The LF \muSR data at fields 0\leqslant H\leqslant 0.45 T at T=1.4, 10, 18, and 35 K were fitted by the relaxation function in Eq. (1). The representative fits are shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The fit parameters A_{0} and \lambda are shown in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d) as a function of H. It is seen from Fig. 4(c) that at 1.4 and 10 K A_{0} shows a weak increase with

  increasing H for H\geqslant 0.2 T. This increase in A_{0} for H\geqslant 0.2 T is quite significant at 18 K. At 35 K too an extremely weak increase in A_{0} is observed. On the other hand, the \lambda is almost insensitive to field at 1.4 and 10 K [Fig. 4(d)]. At 18 K \lambda shows strong dependence on H. The \lambda decreases with increasing H for the entire range of H (0\leqslant H\leqslant 0.45 T). A weak decrease in \lambda at H\geqslant 0.2 T is observed even at 35 K.

## IV Neutron diffraction study

Figure 5 shows the neutron diffraction (ND) data collected at 1.8 and 25 K for the detector bank-3 (centered at 90^{\prime}) of WISH. The Fullprof structural refinement of ND data at 25 K reveal ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type body-centered-tetragonal (space group 14/mmm) structure of Eu(Fe_{0.86}Ir_{0.14})_{2}As_{2}. The refinement profile is shown in Fig. 5(a) and crystallographic parameters are listed in Table I. Since we did not observe any clear impurity phase we expect the chemical composition of the sample to be the same as the starting stoichiometry. Accordingly, while refining, the occupancies of Fe and Ir were kept fixed according to the stoichiometric ratio. The crystallographic parameters obtained from refinement of 25 K ND data are compared with those obtained from the refinement of room temperature powder XRD data in Table I. While the lattice parameter a and As c axis coordinate z_{\text{As}} are nearly same, the lattice parameter c and hence unit cell volume V_{\text{cell}} appears to decrease at lower temperature. The ND data thus show that the crystal structure of Eu(Fe_{0.86}Ir_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} at 25 K remains the same as at room temperature. Furthermore, no evidence of structural change is obtained from the ND data down to 1.8 K.

A comparison of ND data at 25 and 1.8 K is shown in Fig. 5(b). It is clearly seen that at low temperature (1.8 K) there is a significant increase in the intensity of several nuclear peaks, in particular there is a very strong enhancement in the intensity of the (1 0 1) nuclear peak at d=3.73A (which is almost zero at 25 K), which as expected, indicates a long range magnetic phase transition. The Q dependence (Q=2\pi/d) of the intensities of these peaks (strong at smaller Q or at larger d spacing) confirms that they are due to the long range magnetic ordering of the Eu/Fe moment. Furthermore, it is seen that all the magnetic peaks appear only at the position of nuclear peaks which can be taken as a signature of ferromagnetic nature of ordering. No additional magnetic Bragg peaks were observed in the reentrant state (e.g., at 14 K, data not shown). Therefore, the magnetic structure seems to remain unchanged between the reentrant and superconducting phases.

In order to estimate the magnetic propagation vector \mathbf{k}, an automatic indexing procedure using a grid search in Fullprof program was used. Our neutron diffraction data provide a direct estimation of the propagation vector, which is \mathbf{k}=(0,0,0). The \mathbf{k}=(0,0,0) propagation vector has also been seen for ferromagnetic ordering of the Eu^{+2} moments in Eu(Fe_{0.82}Co_{0.18})_{2}As_{2}[20] and EuFe_{2}(A_{8.81}P_{0.19})_{2}[25]. For the parent compound EuFe_{2}As_{2} the A-type antiferromagnetism of Eu^{+2} is characterized by the propagation vector \mathbf{k}=(0,0,1) and the ordering of Fe^{+2} moments by \mathbf{k}=(1,0,1)[8]. The appearance of strongest magnetic Bragg peak at the weakest nuclear Bragg peak (1 0 1) at d=3.73A and the absence of incommensurate peaks further support the \mathbf{k}=(0,0,0) propagation vector.

The solid line through the experimental points is the structural Rietveld refinement profile calculated for the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type body-centered-tetragonal (space group 14/mmm) structure. The vertical bars indicate the Bragg peak positions. The lowermost curve represents the difference between the experimental data and calculated intensities. (b) Comparison of ND patterns recorded at 1.8 and 25 K. (c) The structural and magnetic refinement profile for ND pattern at 1.8 K. Peaks marked with a star in (a) and (c) arise from the sample holder.

  The intensity of observed magnetic peaks decreases with increasing temperature. The T dependence of intensity is evident from Fig. 6(a) in which the intensity of the (1 0 1) Bragg peak is compared for three temperatures 25 K (>T_{\rm Eu}) and 1.8 and 12 K (<T_{\rm Eu}). The temperature evolution of integrated intensity of the (1 0 1) magnetic Bragg peak is shown in Fig. 6(b). The T dependent intensity of the magnetic peak represents the order parameter of the magnetic transition, which is well fitted by a power law I\propto(1-T/T_{\rm Eu})^{2/\beta}, yielding the transition temperature T_{\rm Eu}=18.2(1) K and the exponent \beta=0.31(2). T_{\rm Eu} determined here is in good agreement with the results from \muSR, resistivity, and magnetization measurements. The \beta obtained is comparable to \beta=0.35(2) for Eu(Fe_{0.82}Co_{0.18})_{2}As_{2}[20] and \beta=0.36(4) for EuFe_{2}(As_{0.81}Po_{1.9}), [25] and to that of the three-dimensional Heisenberg system (\beta\approx 0.36) [41, 46].

In order to determine the magnetic structure we employed a method whereby combinations of axial vectors localized on the 2a(Eu) site and also on the 4d(Fe) site and transforming as basis functions of the irreducible representations of the wave vector group [{\bf k}=(0,0,0)] are systematically tested. We carried out symmetry analysis using the SARA program [47]. The symmetry analysis for the Eu moment ordering showed two nonzero irreducible representations (IRs), one is one-dimensional representation, labeled \Gamma_{3}, and the other is two-dimensional representation \Gamma_{9} in the little group. Only \Gamma_{3} and \Gamma_{9} enter the decomposition of \Gamma_{\rm magFe} = \Gamma_{3}+\Gamma_{5}. \Gamma_{3} corresponds to FM ordering of the Eu sites with moments along the c axis, while \Gamma_{9} corresponds to FM ordering of the Eu sites with moments along the a axis or b axis.

On the other hand, the symmetry analysis for the Fe moment ordering yielded that only four IRs enter the magnetic decomposition, two of which are one-dimensional representations (labeled \Gamma_{3} and \Gamma_{6}) and the remaining two are two-dimensional representations (\Gamma_{9} and \Gamma_{10}) in the little group. Therefore, \Gamma_{\rm magFe} = \Gamma_{3}+\Gamma_{6}+\Gamma_{9}+\Gamma_{10}. \Gamma_{3} corresponds to FM ordering of the Fe sites with moments along the c axis, whereas \Gamma_{6} corresponds to AFM ordering along the c axis. \Gamma_{9} shows FM along the a axis or FM along the b axis, while \Gamma_{10} shows AFM along the a axis or AFM along the b axis.

In our analysis we tried to fit the magnetic structure using IRs \Gamma_{3} and \Gamma_{9}. The analysis for \Gamma_{9} did not fit the observed intensity near 5.94 and 3.73 A well. The fit gave more intensity for the 5.94 A peak than the observed one, while the calculated intensity of the 3.73 A peak was almost half of the observed intensity. This indicated that IR \Gamma_{9} does not provide the correct representation for our data. Next we tried fitting our data based on IR \Gamma_{3}, which has one basis function. This basis function gives FM alignment of both Eu and Fe moment along the c axis. First we allowed varying both the Eu and Fe moments and we obtained a reasonably good fit to the data with moments on Eu [6.27(5) \mu_{\rm J}] and Fe [0.12(6) \mu_{\rm B}] at 1.8 K with magnetic Bragg factor 12.6%. In the second state of refinement we kept Fe moment fixed to zero and only varied the Eu moment. A good fit of the 1.8 K ND data was obtained for the Eu moment of 6.29(5) \mu_{\rm B} with magnetic Bragg factor 12.5%. Though the magnetic Bragg factor is nearly the same with and without

The zero value of the Fe moment was also observed in our Mossbauer study [27], which supports our analysis with fixing the Fe moment to zero. The refinement of magnetic Bragg peaks at 1.8 K within IR \Gamma_{3} is shown in Fig. 5(c). The magnetic structure of Eu(Fe0.86Ir0.14)_{2}As_{2} determined this way consists of ferromagnetically coupled Eu moments aligned along the c axis and is shown in Fig. 7. The ordered moment 6.29(5) \mu_{\text{B}} obtained from the refinement of 1.8 K neutron diffraction data is somewhat smaller than the theoretically expected value of 7.0 \mu_{\text{B}} for Eu^{+2} (S=7/2) ions. An ordered moment of 6.6(2) \mu_{\text{B}} was found from neutron diffraction study on EuFe_{2}(As_{0.81}P_{0.19})_{2}[25].

## V V. Summary and conclusions

The interplay of magnetic order and superconductivity in Eu(Fe0.86Ir0.14)_{2}As_{2} has been investigated by microscopic tools of \muSR and neutron powder diffraction, and magnetic structure was determined. Our \muSR data confirmed the long range magnetic ordering below T_{\text{Eu}}=18.7(2) K and the magnetic ground state was found to be ferromagnetic in nature. The magnetic structure determination from neutron diffraction further confirmed the ferromagnetic structure showing that ferromagnetically coupled Eu moments are aligned along the c axis with a magnetic propagation wave vector \mathbf{k}=(0,0,0) and ordered moment of 6.29(5) \mu_{\text{B}} at 1.8 K. Thus both \muSR and neutron diffraction indicate ferromagnetic ordering in Eu(Fe0.86Ir0.14)_{2}As_{2} which coexists with superconductivity as inferred from the magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements. As proposed earlier for the coexistence of ferromagnetic order and superconductivity in Eu(Fe0.73Ru0.25)_{2}As_{2}[29] and EuFe2(As0.85P0.15)_{2}[24], the ferromagnetic superconductivity in the present compound may also be ascribed to the formation of the spontaneous-vortex phase. Further investigations are desired to understand the mechanism of coexistence of magnetic order and superconductivity in these ferromagnetic superconductors.

It is seen that while substitution of Fe by Co, Ru, and Ir leads to superconductivity, no superconductivity is observed in Ni-doped EuFe_{2}As_{2}. This contrasts the Ni doping in BaFe_{2}As_{2} which also induces superconductivity and breaks the intuitive analogy between the doping behavior of EuFe_{2}As_{2} and BaFe_{2}As_{2}. An obvious question is: Is it the ferromagnetic order of Eu^{+2} moments which is responsible for the absence of superconductivity in Eu(Fe1-_{x}Ni_{x})_{2}As_{2}? A comparative study of superconducting Co-, Ru-, and Ir-doped EuFe_{2}As_{2} and nonsuperconducting Ni-doped EuFe_{2}As_{2} should prove informative in understanding the difference of the superconducting behaviors of these two groups of ferromagnetically ordered compounds and enrich our knowledge of the conditions to realize the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity.

Furthermore, it appears that the substitution at Fe or As sites stabilizes the ab-plane ferromagnetic exchange interaction of undoped EuFe_{2}As_{2} and the direction of Eu^{+2} moments also changes from the ab-plane orientation to along the c axis in doped EuFe_{2}As_{2}. The change in magnetic structure upon doping the Fe or As sites is most likely brought by the change in RKKY interaction which is mediated by the conduction electrons from the FeAs layers. If this is the case one would expect the nature of magnetic order to remain unchanged upon doping at the Eu site or upon the application of pressure as the FeAs layers remain intact. It would be of interest to check this hypothesis by magnetic structure determination of Eu site doped EuFe_{2}As_{2} and in the pressure induced superconducting state for which the coexistence of antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity is more intuitive.

_Note added in proof_. Recently, we came across a recent neutron diffraction work on Eu(Fe0.88Ir0.12)_{2}As_{2} by W. T. Jin _et al._[48].

###### Abstract

Results of muon spin relaxation (\muSR) and neutron powder diffraction measurements on a reentrant superconductor Eu(Fe_{0.86}Ir_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} are presented. Eu(Fe_{0.86}Ir_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} exhibits superconductivity at T_{\rm{c}on}\approx 22.5 K competing with long range ordered Eu^{+2} moments below \approx18 K. A reentrant behavior (manifested by nonzero resistivity in the temperature range 10-17.5 K) results from an exquisite competition between the superconductivity and magnetic order. The zero field \muSR data confirm the long range magnetic ordering below T_{\rm{E}b}=18.7(2) K. The transition temperature is found to increase with increasing magnetic field in longitudinal field \muSR, which along with the neutron diffraction results, suggests the transition to be ferromagnetic. The neutron diffraction data reveal a clear presence of magnetic Bragg peaks below T_{\rm{E}b} which could be indexed with propagation vector \mathbf{k}=(0,0,0), confirming a long range magnetic ordering in agreement with \muSR data. Our analysis of the magnetic structure reveals an ordered magnetic moment of 6.29(5) \mu_{\rm{B}} (at 1.8 K) on the Eu atoms and they form a ferromagnetic structure with moments aligned along the c axis. No change in the magnetic structure is observed in the reentrant or superconducting phases and the magnetic structure remains same for 1.8 K \leqslantT\leqslantT_{\rm{E}b}. No clear evidence of structural transition or Fe moment ordering was found.

## I Introduction

The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in 2008 in doped AFe_{2}As_{2} (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) after the complete suppression of antiferromagnetic/spin density wave (SDW) transition triggered world-wide research interests in this class of materials [1, 2, 3, 4]. The occurrence of superconductivity was soon found in their magnetic analog, the K-doped EuFe_{2}As_{2}[5, 6]. EuFe_{2}As_{2} attracted special attention because of the additional opportunity of exploring the interplay and coexistence of magnetic order and superconductivity brought by the Eu^{+2} (S=7/2) local moments. Like AFe_{2}As_{2}, EuFe_{2}As_{2} also crystallizes in the same layered body-centered-tetragonal ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure (space group I4/mmm) and exhibits a structural and SDW transition at 190 K associated with the itinerant Fe moments [1, 6, 7, 8]. In addition, the Eu^{+2} moments order antiferromagnetically below 19 K with an A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure on Eu sublattice with the ordered Eu^{+2} moments aligned ferromagnetically in the ab plane and antiferromagnetically along the c axis [8]. The Fe^{+2} moments order antiferromagnetically along the orthorhombic a axis below the structural and SDW transition at 190 K [8]. The SDW transition is easily suppressed by partial substitutions at Eu, Fe, or As sites or by the application of external pressure leading to superconductivity that coexists with the long range ordering of Eu moments [5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].

The hole doping by partial K substitution for Eu was found to yield superconductivity in Eu_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} with T_{\rm{c}}\approx 33 K for Eu_{0.5}K_{0.5}Fe_{2}As_{2} coexisting with short range ordered Eu^{+2} moments below 15 K [5, 9]. The electron doping by partial Co substitution for Fe leads to reentrant superconductivity in Eu(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} with T_{\rm{c}}\approx 21 K and reentrant behavior below 17 K for x=0.11[10, 11]. However, no superconductivity is observed in Ni-doped Eu(Fe_{1-x}Ni_{x})_{2}As_{2}, even though the SDW transition is suppressed completely [16]. The substitution of Fe by Ni in the optimally hole-doped superconductor Eu_{0.5}K_{0.5}Fe_{2}As_{2} was found to lead to revival of SDW and Eu moment ordering in Eu_{0.5}K_{0.5}(Fe_{1-x}Ni_{x})_{2}As_{2}. [17]. The substitution of As by sequential or induces reentrant superconductivity in EuFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x}) with T_{\rm{c}}= 26 K and Eu magnetic order below 20 K for x=0.15[12, 13]. The application of pressure also leads to reentrant superconductivity with T_{\rm{c}}\sim 26 K at a pressure of around 2.5 GPa [14, 15].

The interests in these doped EuFe_{2}As_{2} were sparked because of the long-standing issues of the coexistence of long range magnetic order and superconductivity since such discoveries in rare earth borides and borocarbides [18, 19]. In order to understand the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity in these doped EuFe_{2}As_{2} it is essential to have the knowledge of their magnetic structure. The bulk properties measurements often give an initial idea of possible magnetic structures that needs to be verified by more specific tools such as neutron diffraction (ND) and synchrotron measurements. From the bulk properties measurements of Co-doped EuFe_{2}As_{2}, Jiang _et al._[10] proposed a helical magnetic structure for Eu(Fe_{0.86}Co_{0.11})_{2}As_{2} and Guguchia _et al._[11] proposed a canted antiferromagnetic structure for  Eu(Fe_{0.9}Co_{0.1})_{2}As_{2}. The magnetic structure determination by neutron diffraction study on Eu(Fe_{0.82}Co_{0.18})_{2}As_{2} revealed a ferromagnetic (FM) structure with the ordered Eu^{+2} moments directed along the c axis [20]. Contradictory antiferromagnetic versus ferromagnetic ground states were reported for P-doped EuFe_{2}As_{2} by Zapf _et al._[21, 22] and Nowik _et al._[23] respectively, from the bulk properties measurements and Mossbauer studies. Recent x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS) study by Nandi _et al._[24] reveal the magnetic structure of reentrant superconductor EuFe_{2}(As_{0.85}P_{0.15})_{2} to be ferromagnetic with Eu^{+2} moments aligned along the c axis. The ferromagnetic structure of Eu^{+2} moments was further confirmed from the neutron diffraction study on EuFe_{2}(As_{0.81}P_{0.19}) [25].

Recently some of us discovered reentrant superconductivity in Ir-doped EuFe_{2}As_{2}[26, 27]. Ir, though isoelectronic to Co, being a 5d transition metal benefits with an extended d orbital resulting in an increased hybridization and decreased Stoner enhancement factor, therefore the suppression of SDW in parent EuFe_{2}As_{2} is expected to be more effective with Ir doping. For the optimal Ir doping, in Eu(Fe_{0.86}To_{10.4})_{2}As_{2} the superconducting transition sets in at T_{\rm{co}}\approx 22.5 K and the long range ordering of Eu^{+2} moments is observed below \approx18 K coexisting with superconductivity [26, 27]. The reentrant behavior is reflected by a nonzero resistivity over 10-17.5 K caused by the ordering of Eu^{+2} moments as confirmed by the ^{151}Eu Mossbauer spectroscopy [27]. Investigations on single crystal Eu(Fe_{0.86}In_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} revealed evidence for anisotropic magnetic and superconducting properties, the superconducting diamagnetic signal is observed in magnetic susceptibility only for an applied field H\parallel c and not for H\perp c, though the ab-plane resistivity exhibits zero resistivity state [27]. Jiao _et al._ suggested the nature of magnetic ordering to be ferromagnetic in Eu(Fe_{0.88}Ir_{0.12})_{2}As_{2}[28]. Isoelectronic substitution of Fe by Ru is also reported to have ferromagnetic ordering of Eu moment in Eu(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2} coexisting with superconductivity [29]. The nonsuperconducting Eu(Fe_{1-x}Ni_{x})_{2}As_{2} also have ferromagnetic ground state for 0.03 \leq x\leq 0.[16].

The neutron diffraction study on Eu(Fe_{0.82}Co_{0.18})_{2}As_{2}[20] and EuFe_{2}(As_{0.81}P_{0.19})_{2}[25] provide clear evidence for the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity in these systems. While the coexistence of antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity is now perceived, the coexistence of ferromagnetic order and superconductivity which are antagonistic to each other is still puzzling and deserves microscopic investigations. In order to check the above inference of ferromagnetic ordering in Ir-doped EuFe_{2}As_{2} and find out whether the ferromagnetic nature of Eu-magnetic order is more general for the doped EuFe_{2}As_{2} or specific to the case of substitution of Fe by Co and of As by P we have determined the magnetic structure of reentrant superconductor Eu(Fe_{0.86}In_{0.14})_{2}As_{2}. Here we report our muon spin relaxation (\muSR) and neutron powder diffraction investigations on Eu(Fe_{0.86}In_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} and show that the nature of the long range magnetic order of Eu^{+2} moments is indeed ferromagnetic for Ir doping too.

Theoretically ferromagnetism has been suggested to coexist with superconductivity under certain conditions: (a) when the ferromagnetism is cryptoferromagnetic with multidomains such that the net magnetization is zero over the superconducting coherence length [30], (b) when ferromagnetism polarizes the Cooper pairs leading to an inhomogeneous superconductivity referred as Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinikov (FFLO) phase [31, 32], and (c) when a spontaneous-vortex phase is formed by the internal field of ferromagnetic order such that the combined energy of the coexisting phase is lowered [33]. Jiao _et al._ suggested the possibility of a spontaneous-vortex phase -and/or FFLO state for the coexistence of ferromagnetic order and superconductivity in Eu(Fe_{0.75}Ru_{0.25})_{2}As_{2}[29]. Nandi _et al._ suggested a spontaneous vortex in EuFe_{2}(As_{0.85}P_{0.15})_{2}[24]. The coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity in Eu(Fe_{0.86}In_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} may also have a similar mechanism.

In the following we present our results of \muSR and ND measurements on Eu(Fe_{0.86}In_{0.14})_{2}As_{2}. The zero field (ZF) \muSR results confirm the long range magnetic ordering below T_{\rm{Eu}}=18.7(2) K and the longitudinal field (LF) \muSR indicated the nature of long range order to be ferromagnetic. The neutron diffraction data allowed us to determine the magnetic structure, further supporting the ferromagnetic order below T_{\rm{Eu}}. The ordered Eu^{+2} moments lie along the tetragonal c axis with a magnetic propagation wave vector {\bf k}=(0,0,0). At 1.8 K the ordered state moment is found to be 6.29(5) \mu_{\rm{B}}. The \muSR or neutron diffraction data do not show any evidence for any change in magnetic structure in superconducting and reentrant phases.

## II Experimental Details

The polycrystalline sample of Eu(Fe_{0.86}In_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} was prepared by the solid state reaction method [26, 27] starting with the high purity elements (Eu: 99.9%, Fe: 99.999%, Ir: 99.99%, and As: 99.999%) in stoichiometric ratio. Fine pieces of Eu were mixed with Fe, Ir, and As powders, pelletized and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube and fired at 900^{\circ}C for 30 h. After the first firing the sample was thoroughly ground and again pelletized and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube. The sintering for 5 days at 900^{\circ}C yielded good quality sample as indicated by the powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) data.

The \muSR measurement was carried out at the ISIS facility of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Didcot, UK, using the EMU spectrometer both in zero field and in longitudinal fields up to 0.45 T. The powdered sample of Eu(Fe_{0.86}In_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} was mounted on a high purity silver plate using diluted GE varnish and covered with Kapton film. The low temperature was achieved by cooling the sample in a standard He-4 cryostat. In order to minimize the effect of the stray fields at the sample position the correction coils were used which ensured the stray field to be within 1 \muT. The zero-field \muSR data were collected in the temperature range 1.2 to 100 K, and LF data were collected at 1.4, 10, 18, and 35 K for fields up to 0.45 T.

The neutron diffraction measurements were carried out using the WISH time of flight diffractometer [34] at the ISIS Facility. The powdered Eu(Fe_{0.86}In_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} sample was lightly packed in a thin-walled vanadium can (diameter 3 mm) to reduce packing ratio and thereby absorption. The low temperature was achieved by cooling the sample inside a He-4 cryostat using He-exchange gas to ensure good thermal contact at low temperature. ND data were collected with long counting (4 h per run) at 1.8, 12, 16, and 25 K in order to determine magnetic structure as well as any change in magnetic structure with temperature. We also collected  data at several temperatures between 1.8 and 25 K with shorter counting time (30 min per point) to investigate the temperature dependence of order parameter. The refinement of neutron diffraction data was carried out using the Fullprof program [35].

## III Muon spin relaxation study

In order to shed light on the magnetic phase transitions seen in the zero-field resistivity of Eu(Fe_{0.86}Ir_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} below the superconducting transition T_{\rm c}\approx 21.5 K, we have investigated the temperature T dependence of the muon spin relaxation in zero-field (ZF), in applied longitudinal magnetic fields H=0.10 and 0.45 T, as well as H dependence at T=10 and 18 K. Figure 1 shows the \muSR asymmetry spectra of Eu(Fe_{0.86}Ir_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} at few representative temperatures between 1.2 and 50 K collected in zero field while warming the sample. For T\gtrsim 20 K, the \muSR spectra exhibit a typical behavior expected from the fluctuating paramagnetic moments with full initial asymmetry of 20% at 100 K. At T<20 K a loss (\sim2/3 at 1.2 K) in the initial asymmetry is clearly seen which is an indication of a long range magnetic ordering. Furthermore, the absence of asymmetry-time oscillations indicates that the ordered state moments are too large to be observed in the time windows of the EMU spectrometer.

The ZF \muSR spectra were fitted using a Lorentzian (also called exponential function) decay,

\[G_{z}(t,H)=A_{0}\exp(-\lambda t)+A_{\rm BG},\] (1)

where A_{0} is the initial asymmetry parameter, \lambda is the electronic relaxation rate mainly arising from the local moments, and A_{\rm BG} is a nonrelaxing constant background from the silver sample holder. The A_{\rm BG} was estimated from the 100 K ZF data and was kept fixed for the rest of the analysis. The fits of the \muSR data by the relaxation function in Eq. (1) are shown by the solid curves in Fig. 1. Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of parameters A_{0} and \lambda obtained from the fits of the ZF \muSR spectra for 1.2\leqslant T\leqslant 100 K. It is seen from Fig. 2(a) that the initial asymmetry A_{0} starts decreasing as T is lowered below 24 K and exhibits a sharp drop below 20 K. At low TA_{0} is only 1/3 of its high temperature value, i.e., there is a drop in A_{0} by 2/3 of its high-T value, which confirms the bulk nature of the long range magnetic ordering in Eu(Fe_{0.86}Ir_{0.14})_{2}As_{2}. Furthermore, \lambda increases with decreasing temperature below 100 K and exhibits a peak near 19 K, which is due to the long range magnetic ordering. The absence of any additional anomaly both in A_{0} and \lambda below 19 K, indicates that there is only one magnetic phase transition at T_{\rm Eu}\approx 19 K which is probed by muon spin relaxation. Thus we do not see a reentrant feature in \muSR.

It is interesting to note from Fig. 2(a) that the magnetic volume fraction of the sample is close to 100%. The superconducting volume fraction has also been found to be nearly 100% from the magnetic susceptibility measurements on Eu(Fe_{0.86}Ir_{0.14})_{2}As_{2}[26, 27]. This suggests that the whole volume of the sample participates in both magnetic ordering and superconductivity.

Though \lambda is not a strict order parameter, it is a measure of spatial correlation length \xi and can give an idea of critical dynamics: \lambda\sim\xi^{3/2} for a ferromagnet and \lambda\sim\xi^{1/2} for an antiferromagnet, whereas \xi\sim(T/T_{\rm tr}-1)^{-\omega} in the close vicinity of the transition temperature T_{\rm tr}[36, 37, 38]. The T dependence of \lambda could be described well by the critical exponent behavior \lambda(T)=\lambda_{0}|1-T/T_{\rm Eu}|^{-\omega}[38, 39, 40] for both T<T_{\rm Eu} and T>T_{\rm Eu}. For a three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnet (neutron diffraction data in the next section reveal a 3D ferromagnetism in the present compound) the exponent w\approx v(z-1)\approx 1.05 with exponents v\approx 0.70 and z=5/2[38, 40, 41]. The fits of \lambda(T) are shown by the solid curves in

Figure 1: (Color online) Zero field muon spin asymmetry function G_{z}(t,H) versus time t\muSR spectra of Eu(Fe_{0.86}Ir_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} at a few representative temperatures. Solid curves are the fits to the \muSR data by the relaxation function in Eq. (1).

The solid curves in (b) are the fits to critical exponent behavior \lambda(T)=\lambda_{0}|1-T/T_{\rm Eu}|^{-\omega}.

  Fig. 2(b). For T<T_{\rm Eu} a good fit is obtained for fit parameters \lambda_{0}=0.039(2)\mus^{-1}, T_{\rm Eu}=18.7(2) K, and w=1.20(6) from fitting over 1.2\leqslant T\leqslant 18 K. Whereas for T>T_{\rm Eu} the fit parameters are \lambda_{0}=0.94(2)\mus^{-1}, T_{\rm Eu}=18.0(5) K, and w=0.28(2) for fit over 20\leqslant T\leqslant 100 K. It is seen that for T<T_{\rm Eu} we obtain exponent w=1.20(6) which is close to the expected value of w\approx 1.05 for a 3D ferromagnet. A similar value of the exponent w=1.06(9) is reported for the ferrimagnet Cu_{2}OSeO_{3} which was obtained from the fit of \lambda(T) in the paramagnetic state (T>T_{\rm c}) [42]. However, for T>T_{\rm Eu} we see that the exponent w is much lower than the expected value. Even for the fitting range close to T_{\rm Eu} in T\leqslant 1.3T_{\rm Eu} there is no gain in w. This deviation possibly could be due to the muon-lattice dipolar interaction which is known to strongly affect the paramagnetic critical dynamics near the transition temperature of a ferromagnet [38, 40]. Efforts have been made in past to determine the T dependence of \lambda in the critical regime of dipolar Heisenberg ferromagnets using the mode coupling (MC) theory [36, 38, 43, 44]. Within the MC theory the effect of dipolar interactions is accounted for by the splitting of magnetic fluctuations into longitudinal and transverse modes in the reciprocal space, and the relative weight of transverse and longitudinal modes determines the critical \lambda(T) behavior. Unfortunately we do not have all the necessary ingredients for the calculation of MC theory prediction for our compound. We compare our results with the MC theory prediction for the 3D Heisenberg ferromagnet EuO [38, 45]. From Fig. 2(b) we see that there is a noticeable rise in \lambda, as the temperature is lowered from 50 K towards T_{\rm Eu} with a maximum value of \lambda\approx 2\mus^{-1} near T_{\rm Eu}. This value is very small compared to the MC theory calculated critical value of \sim12 \mus^{-1}[38], but very close to the experimental value of \lambda\approx 2\mus^{-1} for EuO near T_{\rm c}=70 K [45].

The LF \muSR measurements in H=0.10 and 0.45 T were done to understand the nature of the magnetic phase transition at T_{\rm Eu}\approx 19 K. The H=0.10 and 0.45 T LF \muSR data at various T were also fitted by the relaxation function in Eq. (1), thus yielding the T and H dependent fit parameters. The LF \muSR data at selected temperatures and their fits are shown in. Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). The T dependence of the fit parameters A_{0} and \lambda obtained for H=0.10 and 0.45 T are shown in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d) and compared with the ZF A_{0}(T) and \lambda(T). It is seen from Fig. 3(c) that while at H=0.10 T the LF A_{0}(T) is nearly similar to ZF A_{0}(T), at H=0.45 T there is a small increase in A_{0}. A substantial influence of field is observed on the T dependence of \lambda [Fig. 3(d)]. At H=0.10 T the peak height of \lambda is decreased and at H=0.45 T the peak in \lambda(T) almost disappears. Furthermore, at H=0.45 T the drop in the \lambda(T) starts at a temperature around 25 K compared to 19 K for ZF. This indicates that at H=0.45 T the transition temperature has increased to 25 from 19 K, thus revealing a ferromagnetic nature of the phase transition at T_{\rm Eu}\approx 19 K as deduced from the neutron diffraction data in the next section.

In Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) we show the LF \muSR asymmetry spectra of Eu(Fe_{0.86}Ir_{0.14})As_{2} at different fields at T=10 and 18 K. It is seen that the initial asymmetry increases with increasing field. While the increase in initial asymmetry is very weak at 10 K, the increase is significant at 18 K, increases by almost a factor of 2 at 0.45 T. The LF \muSR data at fields 0\leqslant H\leqslant 0.45 T at T=1.4, 10, 18, and 35 K were fitted by the relaxation function in Eq. (1). The representative fits are shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The fit parameters A_{0} and \lambda are shown in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d) as a function of H. It is seen from Fig. 4(c) that at 1.4 and 10 K A_{0} shows a weak increase with

  increasing H for H\geqslant 0.2 T. This increase in A_{0} for H\geqslant 0.2 T is quite significant at 18 K. At 35 K too an extremely weak increase in A_{0} is observed. On the other hand, the \lambda is almost insensitive to field at 1.4 and 10 K [Fig. 4(d)]. At 18 K \lambda shows strong dependence on H. The \lambda decreases with increasing H for the entire range of H (0\leqslant H\leqslant 0.45 T). A weak decrease in \lambda at H\geqslant 0.2 T is observed even at 35 K.

## IV Neutron diffraction study

Figure 5 shows the neutron diffraction (ND) data collected at 1.8 and 25 K for the detector bank-3 (centered at 90^{\prime}) of WISH. The Fullprof structural refinement of ND data at 25 K reveal ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type body-centered-tetragonal (space group 14/mmm) structure of Eu(Fe_{0.86}Ir_{0.14})_{2}As_{2}. The refinement profile is shown in Fig. 5(a) and crystallographic parameters are listed in Table I. Since we did not observe any clear impurity phase we expect the chemical composition of the sample to be the same as the starting stoichiometry. Accordingly, while refining, the occupancies of Fe and Ir were kept fixed according to the stoichiometric ratio. The crystallographic parameters obtained from refinement of 25 K ND data are compared with those obtained from the refinement of room temperature powder XRD data in Table I. While the lattice parameter a and As c axis coordinate z_{\text{As}} are nearly same, the lattice parameter c and hence unit cell volume V_{\text{cell}} appears to decrease at lower temperature. The ND data thus show that the crystal structure of Eu(Fe_{0.86}Ir_{0.14})_{2}As_{2} at 25 K remains the same as at room temperature. Furthermore, no evidence of structural change is obtained from the ND data down to 1.8 K.

A comparison of ND data at 25 and 1.8 K is shown in Fig. 5(b). It is clearly seen that at low temperature (1.8 K) there is a significant increase in the intensity of several nuclear peaks, in particular there is a very strong enhancement in the intensity of the (1 0 1) nuclear peak at d=3.73A (which is almost zero at 25 K), which as expected, indicates a long range magnetic phase transition. The Q dependence (Q=2\pi/d) of the intensities of these peaks (strong at smaller Q or at larger d spacing) confirms that they are due to the long range magnetic ordering of the Eu/Fe moment. Furthermore, it is seen that all the magnetic peaks appear only at the position of nuclear peaks which can be taken as a signature of ferromagnetic nature of ordering. No additional magnetic Bragg peaks were observed in the reentrant state (e.g., at 14 K, data not shown). Therefore, the magnetic structure seems to remain unchanged between the reentrant and superconducting phases.

In order to estimate the magnetic propagation vector \mathbf{k}, an automatic indexing procedure using a grid search in Fullprof program was used. Our neutron diffraction data provide a direct estimation of the propagation vector, which is \mathbf{k}=(0,0,0). The \mathbf{k}=(0,0,0) propagation vector has also been seen for ferromagnetic ordering of the Eu^{+2} moments in Eu(Fe_{0.82}Co_{0.18})_{2}As_{2}[20] and EuFe_{2}(A_{8.81}P_{0.19})_{2}[25]. For the parent compound EuFe_{2}As_{2} the A-type antiferromagnetism of Eu^{+2} is characterized by the propagation vector \mathbf{k}=(0,0,1) and the ordering of Fe^{+2} moments by \mathbf{k}=(1,0,1)[8]. The appearance of strongest magnetic Bragg peak at the weakest nuclear Bragg peak (1 0 1) at d=3.73A and the absence of incommensurate peaks further support the \mathbf{k}=(0,0,0) propagation vector.

The vertical bars indicate the Bragg peak positions. The lowermost curve represents the difference between the experimental data and calculated intensities. (b) Comparison of ND patterns recorded at 1.8 and 25 K. (c) The structural and magnetic refinement profile for ND pattern at 1.8 K. Peaks marked with a star in (a) and (c) arise from the sample holder.

  The intensity of observed magnetic peaks decreases with increasing temperature. The T dependence of intensity is evident from Fig. 6(a) in which the intensity of the (1 0 1) Bragg peak is compared for three temperatures 25 K (>T_{\rm Eu}) and 1.8 and 12 K (<T_{\rm Eu}). The temperature evolution of integrated intensity of the (1 0 1) magnetic Bragg peak is shown in Fig. 6(b). The T dependent intensity of the magnetic peak represents the order parameter of the magnetic transition, which is well fitted by a power law I\propto(1-T/T_{\rm Eu})^{2/\beta}, yielding the transition temperature T_{\rm Eu}=18.2(1) K and the exponent \beta=0.31(2). T_{\rm Eu} determined here is in good agreement with the results from \muSR, resistivity, and magnetization measurements. The \beta obtained is comparable to \beta=0.35(2) for Eu(Fe_{0.82}Co_{0.18})_{2}As_{2}[20] and \beta=0.36(4) for EuFe_{2}(As_{0.81}Po_{1.9}), [25] and to that of the three-dimensional Heisenberg system (\beta\approx 0.36) [41, 46].

In order to determine the magnetic structure we employed a method whereby combinations of axial vectors localized on the 2a(Eu) site and also on the 4d(Fe) site and transforming as basis functions of the irreducible representations of the wave vector group [{\bf k}=(0,0,0)] are systematically tested. We carried out symmetry analysis using the SARA program [47]. The symmetry analysis for the Eu moment ordering showed two nonzero irreducible representations (IRs), one is one-dimensional representation, labeled \Gamma_{3}, and the other is two-dimensional representation \Gamma_{9} in the little group. Only \Gamma_{3} and \Gamma_{9} enter the decomposition of \Gamma_{\rm magFe} = \Gamma_{3}+\Gamma_{5}. \Gamma_{3} corresponds to FM ordering of the Eu sites with moments along the c axis, while \Gamma_{9} corresponds to FM ordering of the Eu sites with moments along the a axis or b axis.

On the other hand, the symmetry analysis for the Fe moment ordering yielded that only four IRs enter the magnetic decomposition, two of which are one-dimensional representations (labeled \Gamma_{3} and \Gamma_{6}) and the remaining two are two-dimensional representations (\Gamma_{9} and \Gamma_{10}) in the little group. Therefore, \Gamma_{\rm magFe} = \Gamma_{3}+\Gamma_{6}+\Gamma_{9}+\Gamma_{10}. \Gamma_{3} corresponds to FM ordering of the Fe sites with moments along the c axis, whereas \Gamma_{6} corresponds to AFM ordering along the c axis. \Gamma_{9} shows FM along the a axis or FM along the b axis, while \Gamma_{10} shows AFM along the a axis or AFM along the b axis.

In our analysis we tried to fit the magnetic structure using IRs \Gamma_{3} and \Gamma_{9}. The analysis for \Gamma_{9} did not fit the observed intensity near 5.94 and 3.73 A well. The fit gave more intensity for the 5.94 A peak than the observed one, while the calculated intensity of the 3.73 A peak was almost half of the observed intensity. This indicated that IR \Gamma_{9} does not provide the correct representation for our data. Next we tried fitting our data based on IR \Gamma_{3}, which has one basis function. This basis function gives FM alignment of both Eu and Fe moment along the c axis. First we allowed varying both the Eu and Fe moments and we obtained a reasonably good fit to the data with moments on Eu [6.27(5) \mu_{\rm J}] and Fe [0.12(6) \mu_{\rm B}] at 1.8 K with magnetic Bragg factor 12.6%. In the second state of refinement we kept Fe moment fixed to zero and only varied the Eu moment. A good fit of the 1.8 K ND data was obtained for the Eu moment of 6.29(5) \mu_{\rm B} with magnetic Bragg factor 12.5%. Though the magnetic Bragg factor is nearly the same with and without

\begin{table}

The zero value of the Fe moment was also observed in our Mossbauer study [27], which supports our analysis with fixing the Fe moment to zero. The refinement of magnetic Bragg peaks at 1.8 K within IR \Gamma_{3} is shown in Fig. 5(c). The magnetic structure of Eu(Fe0.86Ir0.14)_{2}As_{2} determined this way consists of ferromagnetically coupled Eu moments aligned along the c axis and is shown in Fig. 7. The ordered moment 6.29(5) \mu_{\text{B}} obtained from the refinement of 1.8 K neutron diffraction data is somewhat smaller than the theoretically expected value of 7.0 \mu_{\text{B}} for Eu^{+2} (S=7/2) ions. An ordered moment of 6.6(2) \mu_{\text{B}} was found from neutron diffraction study on EuFe_{2}(As_{0.81}P_{0.19})_{2}[25].

## V V. Summary and conclusions

The interplay of magnetic order and superconductivity in Eu(Fe0.86Ir0.14)_{2}As_{2} has been investigated by microscopic tools of \muSR and neutron powder diffraction, and magnetic structure was determined. Our \muSR data confirmed the long range magnetic ordering below T_{\text{Eu}}=18.7(2) K and the magnetic ground state was found to be ferromagnetic in nature. The magnetic structure determination from neutron diffraction further confirmed the ferromagnetic structure showing that ferromagnetically coupled Eu moments are aligned along the c axis with a magnetic propagation wave vector \mathbf{k}=(0,0,0) and ordered moment of 6.29(5) \mu_{\text{B}} at 1.8 K. Thus both \muSR and neutron diffraction indicate ferromagnetic ordering in Eu(Fe0.86Ir0.14)_{2}As_{2} which coexists with superconductivity as inferred from the magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements. As proposed earlier for the coexistence of ferromagnetic order and superconductivity in Eu(Fe0.73Ru0.25)_{2}As_{2}[29] and EuFe2(As0.85P0.15)_{2}[24], the ferromagnetic superconductivity in the present compound may also be ascribed to the formation of the spontaneous-vortex phase. Further investigations are desired to understand the mechanism of coexistence of magnetic order and superconductivity in these ferromagnetic superconductors.

It is seen that while substitution of Fe by Co, Ru, and Ir leads to superconductivity, no superconductivity is observed in Ni-doped EuFe_{2}As_{2}. This contrasts the Ni doping in BaFe_{2}As_{2} which also induces superconductivity and breaks the intuitive analogy between the doping behavior of EuFe_{2}As_{2} and BaFe_{2}As_{2}. An obvious question is: Is it the ferromagnetic order of Eu^{+2} moments which is responsible for the absence of superconductivity in Eu(Fe1-_{x}Ni_{x})_{2}As_{2}? A comparative study of superconducting Co-, Ru-, and Ir-doped EuFe_{2}As_{2} and nonsuperconducting Ni-doped EuFe_{2}As_{2} should prove informative in understanding the difference of the superconducting behaviors of these two groups of ferromagnetically ordered compounds and enrich our knowledge of the conditions to realize the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity.

Furthermore, it appears that the substitution at Fe or As sites stabilizes the ab-plane ferromagnetic exchange interaction of undoped EuFe_{2}As_{2} and the direction of Eu^{+2} moments also changes from the ab-plane orientation to along the c axis in doped EuFe_{2}As_{2}. The change in magnetic structure upon doping the Fe or As sites is most likely brought by the change in RKKY interaction which is mediated by the conduction electrons from the FeAs layers. If this is the case one would expect the nature of magnetic order to remain unchanged upon doping at the Eu site or upon the application of pressure as the FeAs layers remain intact. It would be of interest to check this hypothesis by magnetic structure determination of Eu site doped EuFe_{2}As_{2} and in the pressure induced superconducting state for which the coexistence of antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity is more intuitive.

_Note added in proof_. Recently, we came across a recent neutron diffraction work on Eu(Fe0.88Ir0.12)_{2}As_{2} by W. T. Jin _et al._[48].
