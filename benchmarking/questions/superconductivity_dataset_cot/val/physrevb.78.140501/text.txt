The current was applied in the \(ab\) plane and perpendicular to the magnetic field in all cases [as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b)]. The sample with \(x\)=0.4 exhibited a sharp resistive superconducting transition at \(T_{c}\) = 36.5 K (90% of the normal-state resistivity) with \(\Delta T_{c}\) < 0.5 K. The residual resistivity is about \(\rho\)(38 K) = 0.05 m\(\Omega\) cm and the residual resistivity ratio is found to be RRR=\(\rho\)(300 K)/\(\rho\)(38 K)=7.4.

Many experiments had revealed high upper critical fields in the LnFeAsO\({}_{1-x}\)F\({}_{x}\) (the estimated \(H_{c2}^{ab}\) is beyond 50 T for Ln=La and beyond 100 T for Ln=Sm, Pr, and Nd) system.[5, 6, 7] In the Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) system, the value of the upper critical field seems also very high.[8, 9] Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the temperature-dependent resistivity \(\rho\)(\(T\)) curves of the Ba\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) single crystal at magnetic fields up to 9 T along the \(c\) axis and \(ab\) planes, respectively. It is found that the superconducting transitions are broadened slightly, which indicates that the upper critical field should be very high. One can also see that the resistive transition curves shift parallel down to lower temperatures upon using a magnetic field; this may suggest a field-induced pair breaking effect in the present system. This is very different from the case in the cuprate superconductors where the \(\rho\)(\(T\)) broadens by exhibiting a fan structure with the onset transition part barely changed by the magnetic field. From the transition curves in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), we already have an idea that the anisotropy ratio is quite small. In Fig. 3(a) we present the \(H_{c2}\)-\(T\) curves for the Ba\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) single crystal for both \(H\|c\) and \(H\|ab\), respectively. The H\({}_{c2}\)(\(T\)) is determined at the point where \(\rho\)=90%\(\rho_{r}\). The curves of \(H_{c2}\)(\(T\)) are very steep with average slopes \(-dH_{c2}^{ab}/dT_{c}|_{T_{c}}\)=9.35 T/K for \(H\|ab\) and \(-dH_{c2}^{c}/dT_{c}|_{T_{c}}\)=5.49 T/K for \(H\|c\). According to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula[20]\(H_{c2}\)=-0.69(\(dH_{c2}/dT\))\({}_{T_{c}}\) and taking \(T_{c}\)=36.5 K, the values of upper critical fields are \(H_{c2}^{ab}\)(0)=235 T and \(H_{c2}^{c}\)(0)

One can see that the \(\rho_{ab}\)(\(T\)) curve exhibits a continued curvature up to 400 K. The inset shows the temperature-dependent ac susceptibility for the Ba\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) single crystal. Sharp superconducting transitions are obvious both in the resistive and in the ac susceptibility data.

The inset of (b) presents the anisotropy ratio of \(H_{c2}\)(0) along \(c\) axis and \(ab\) planes for the four samples. The lines are guides for the eyes.

  = 138 T. Although these high values of upper critical fields may be subject to a modification when the direct measurements are done in the high-field experiments, we believe that the FeAs-based superconductors are really robust against the magnetic field. For example, taking the zero-temperature values we obtained using the WHH formula, we have \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{ab}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\)=235/36.5 T/K=6.43 T/K. This ratio is much beyond the Pauli limit \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\)=1.84 T/K for a singlet pairing when the spin-orbital coupling is weak.[21] This may manifest an unconventional mechanism of superconductivity in this material. The values of \(H_{c2}(0)\) for the other three samples with different doping levels of potassium and thus transition temperatures were also determined in the same way. The results are shown in Fig. 3(b). It is found that the \(H_{c2}(0)\) decreases quickly with the decrease in \(T_{c}\). We note that a recent result reported that the WHH approximation may not be simply applied in these materials[22] and even \(H_{c2}(0)\) may be affected by the multiband property. However, our results clearly indicate that the upper critical fields in the present system are really very high without any doubt. The large value of the ratio \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{ab}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\) was also found in our previous measurements on NdFeAsO\({}_{0.83}\)F\({}_{0.18}\) single crystals.[7] As far as we know, the large value of the ratio \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\) obtained in FeAs-based superconductors has been rarely reported in other superconductors.

In an anisotropic type-II superconductor, the magnetic field destroys superconductivity at the upper critical fields \(H_{c2}^{ab}\) and \(H_{c2}^{c}\) for applied fields \(H\|ab\) and \(H\|c\), respectively. The effective upper critical field varies between the two orientations depending on the superconducting anisotropy ratio \(\Gamma\)=\(H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^{c}\). In the inset of Fig. 3(b), we show the doping dependence of the anisotropy ratio \(H_{c2}^{ab}(0)/H_{c2}^{c}(0)\) for the samples with different doping levels. One can see that the anisotropy for different samples all locate around two. This result is surprising to us since the band-structure calculations by Singh[23] clearly show that the Fermi-surface sheets and dimensionality strongly depend on the doping level. For the Ba\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) single crystal it is found that \(\Gamma\)\(\approx\) 1.70 \(\sim\) 1.86 at zero temperature, and \(\Gamma\) is below 2.1 for all other samples. This value is quite close to that derived on similar samples also from the shift of the resistive transitions under magnetic fields.[24] The values of anisotropy are rather small in comparison with all cuprate superconductors and slightly lower than that of F-doped NdFeAsO with \(\Gamma\)=\(4\)\(-\)6.[7, 25]

The anisotropy ratio determined above may be subject to a modification because of the uncertainties in determining the upper critical field value by taking different criterions of resistivity and by using different formulas. One major concern was that the zero-temperature value \(H_{c2}(0)\) was determined by using the experimental data near \(T_{c}\). This concern can be removed by the measurements of angular-dependent resistivity. According to the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory, the resistivity in the mixed state depends on the effective field \(H/H_{c2}^{\rm GL}(\theta)\). In this case the resistivity measured at different magnetic fields but at a fixed temperature should be scalable with the variable \(H/H_{c2}^{\rm GL}(\theta)\). The effective upper critical field \(H_{c2}^{\rm GL}(\theta)\) at an angle \(\theta\) is given by

\[H_{c2}^{\rm GL}(\theta)=H_{c2}^{c}/\sqrt{\cos^{2}(\theta)+\Gamma^{-2}{\sin^{2} (\theta)}}.\] (1)

Thus using the scaling variable \(\widetilde{H}\) =\(H\sqrt{\cos^{2}(\theta)+\Gamma^{-2}{\sin^{2}(\theta)}}\), the resistivity should collapse onto one curve in different magnetic fields at a certain temperature[26] when an appropriate \(\Gamma\) value is chosen. Figure 4 presents four sets of data of angular dependence of resistivity at 34.5, 35.5, and 36 K for the Ba\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) single crystal. At each temperature, a cup-shaped feature centered around \(\theta\)=90\({}^{\circ}\) is observed. As shown in Fig. 5, the curves measured at different magnetic fields, but at a fixed temperature, are scaled nicely by adjusting \(\Gamma\). The values of \(\Gamma\) were thus obtained for temperatures 34.5, 35, 35.5, 36, and 36.5 K. Because only one fitting parameter \(\Gamma\) is employed in the scaling for each temperature, the value of \(\Gamma\) is more reliable compared with the one determined from the ratio of

Figure 4: (Color online) Angular dependence of resistivity at (a) 34.5 K in \(\mu_{0}H\)=5,6,7, 9 T, (b) 35 S K in \(\mu_{0}H\)=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 T, (c) 35.5 K in \(\mu_{0}H\) =2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 T, and (d) 36 K in \(\mu_{0}H\)=0.5,1,1.5,2,2.5, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 T for the Ba\({}_{0.6}\) K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) single crystal.

  \(H_{c2}^{ab}\) and \(H_{c,2}^{c}\) as used above. But both methods yield similar values of \(\Gamma\), which implies the validity of the values determined in this work. It is found that the anisotropy increases from 2.43 for 34.5 K to 2.82 for 36 K and then decreases slightly for 36.5 K as plotted in the inset of Fig. 5. Actually the anisotropy was also measured to the much higher field and lower temperature region [8, 9] in the same system, was found to decrease with temperature, and finally reached a value of about 1-1.5 in the low \(T\) limit. This kind of temperature dependence of \(\Gamma(T)\) is not expected for a single band anisotropic superconductor and needs a further check in other measurements. It may be attributed to the effect of the two-gap scenario. [27, 28, 29, 30] In addition, it should be noted that the good scaling behavior suggests a field-independent anisotropy in the temperature and field range we investigated. The small anisotropy can be qualitatively understood based on the recent band-structure calculations [23] in which it is shown that the Fermi-surface sheets are not two-dimensional (2D) cylinderlike but rather exhibit a complicated three-dimensional (3D) feature with a quite strong dispersion along the \(c\) axis. Our results here--very high upper critical fields and very low anisotropy--should be stimulating in fulfilling a quantitative calculation on the electronic structure of the doped samples and ultimately providing an understanding to the underlying mechanism of superconductivity.

In conclusion, we have investigated the temperature-dependent resistivity for Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (0\(<\)\(x\)\(\leq\)0.4) single crystals in magnetic fields up to 9 T. It is found that the system poses a very high upper critical field and a very low superconducting anisotropy ratio which is around two for all the samples. In an alternative way, we also determined the anisotropy ratio by investigating the angle-dependent resistivity in Ba\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.9}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) single crystals. Both methods yield the similar values of the anisotropy ratio \(\Gamma\). Our results strongly suggest that the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory can be used to describe the data in the mixed state very well.
