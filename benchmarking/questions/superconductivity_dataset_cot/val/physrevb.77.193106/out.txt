###### Abstract

Temperature-dependent electrical resistance in quasi-one-dimensional Li0.9Mo6O17 is described by two Luttinger liquid anomalous exponents \alpha, each associated with a distinct one dimensional band. The band with \alpha<1 is argued to crossover to a higher dimension below the temperature T_{M}, leading to superconductivity. Disorder and magnetic fields are shown to induce the Bose metal behavior in this bulk compound.

One dimensional (1D) electrical conductors are attractive because of their inherent simplicity. However, theory shows that weak Coulomb interactions lead to strong perturbations that destroy the discontinuity in the electron occupation at the Fermi surface, which is preserved for three-dimensional (3D) conductors. Other predictions for 1D systems, generally referred to as Luttinger liquids (LL), are spin-charge separation [1] and electrical resistivity obeying a simple power law of temperature. [2] Examples of LLs offer the opportunity to test these predictions. [3] Furthermore, the interplay of disorder, Coulomb interactions, and superconductivity in low-dimensional systems is of general importance.

The purple bronze Li0.9Mo6O17 possesses quasi-1D electrical conductivity [4] and some experiments suggest LL behavior. [5, 6] Two important issues regarding LL physics for Li0.9Mo6O17 are the change from metallic-like to semiconducting-like behavior [hereafter referred to as _metallic_ with dR/dT> 0 and _insulating_ with dR/dT< 0, R(T) is the electrical resistance as a function of temperature T] near 28 K and superconductivity [4] below T_{c}\sim 1.9 K. Attempts to explain the change in dR/dT at 28 K have [5, 6] reached no consensus. Furthermore, superconductivity should not occur in a truly 1D system. These issues were investigated through thermal expansion experiments, [7] which suggest the possibility of a dimensional crossover at 28 K, where dR/dT changes sign. The dimensional crossover phenomenon is an important element in theories for LL systems. [8]

Experiments and band structure calculations [3, 9] reveal two quasi-1D bands crossing the Fermi level in Li0.9Mo6O17. In this paper, each 1D band is shown to have its own distinct value of \alpha, the anomalous exponent characterizing the LL. As a natural consequence, the change from _metallic_ to _insulating_ behavior is explained. Disorder or magnetic field leads to a metallic region below T_{c}, commonly referred to as a Bose metal. Such behavior has not previously been observed in a bulk superconducting compound. This underscores the unusual nature of superconductivity developing from a LL that has undergone dimensional crossover.

Single crystals of Li0.9Mo6O17 were prepared as previously described. [7] Gold contacts were deposited on the samples and four-probe dc electrical resistance was measured in the b-c plane. [10] In this work, 22 single crystals were measured with either superconducting (18 crystals with an average T_{c}=1.92 \pm 0.15 K) or _insulating_ behaviors [no drops in R(T) to 0.4 K].

The R(T) for a typical crystal is shown in Fig. 1. The superconducting transition (magnetic field H=0) is shown only in Fig. 1(b) for clarity. The _metallic_ state and change to _insulating_ behavior at T_{M}\sim 28 K are features common to all the crystals. The R(T) is fitted by using two power laws, R(T)=AT^{n}+BT^{-b}, where A and B are constants. The fit qual

T_{M}=28 K separates _metallic_ and _insulating_ behaviors. (b) Data for H\leq 4 T. The inset compares to 1D hopping mechanism [Eq. (3)]. Numbers in parentheses are n and T_{0}.

  ity is excellent [solid lines in Fig. 1(a)]. Fits for 18 superconducting crystals provide a\!=\!0.43\pm 0.04 and b\!=\!1.6\pm 0.3.

We find a natural explanation for the fit by using a two-band scenario [39] under the assumption that the purple bronze is composed of segregations of two 1D LL bands. Ogata and Anderson [2] showed that the dc resistance of a one-band LL has a temperature dependence of R(T)\!\sim\!T^{1-\alpha}, where a larger \alpha generally indicates stronger Coulomb interactions. This equation and the values for a and b, reveal [11]\alpha_{a}\!=\!0.57\pm 0.04 and \alpha_{b}\!=\!2.6\pm 0.3. This allows easy interpretation of R(T) provided an interaction exists, allowing phase-randomizing hopping between the \alpha_{a} and \alpha_{b} bands. That is, the Hamiltonian [8] may have the generic form

\[{\cal H}=\sum_{i}\left[H_{i,a}+H_{i,b}+B_{i,a\!=\!0.5}\right]+\sum_{ij}T_{i,j},\] (1)

where i and j are chain indices, a and b are band indices, H_{i,a} and H_{i,b} are the 1D LL Hamiltonians for the respective bands, B_{i,a\!=\!b} describes interband hopping, and T_{i,j}\!=\!T_{i_{a}\!=\!-\!i_{a}}\!\rightarrow\!T_{i_{b}\!=\!\rightarrow\!i \!\rightarrow\!i\!\rightarrow\!i\!\rightarrow\!i\!\rightarrow\!i\!\rightarrow\!i\!\rightarrow\!i\!\rightarrow\!i\!\rightarrow\!i\!\rightarrow\!i\!\rightarrow\!i\!\rightarrow\!i\!\rightarrow\!i\!\rightarrow\!i\!\!\rightarrow\!  3. For nonsuperconducting crystals, the low temperature region can be fitted (inset of Fig. 2) with Eq. (3). The fitting suggests that disorder and magnetic field have a _similar_ effect on R(T). Another important issue involves R associated with \alpha_{a} above T_{M}. The samples of Fig. 2 exhibit \alpha_{a} values of 0.55 and 0.57 for the superconducting and nonsuperconducting crystals, respectively, indicating the minor role that disorder has on \alpha_{a}. Fits to four nonsuperconducting crystals provide \alpha_{a}=0.61\pm 0.04, which are comparable to the superconducting crystals (see above), within the uncertainty. These observations may be important in advancing current understanding of disorder's influence on LL systems.[2]

It is evident that a superconductor-insulator transition occurs in Li_{0.9}Mo_{6}O_{17} (see Figs. 1-3); this phase boundary includes a distinct metallic state below T_{c}^{\rm onset}. In particular, Fig. 3 (main panel) shows R(T) below 4 K for four crystals with different degrees of disorder. The insensitivity of T_{c}^{\rm onset} to disorder (see arrow in Fig. 3) is similar to superconductivity in granular superconductors,[7] where a lack of phase coherence results in nonzero resistance with no change in T_{c}^{\rm onset}. The inset of Fig. 3 illustrates that magnetic field has an effect _similar_ to disorder, creating a metallic region at the lowest temperatures followed by an insulating state at higher fields [see Fig. 1(b)]. However, an important distinction from the simple case of disorder is that magnetic field decreases T_{c}^{\rm onset}. The appearance of a metallic state below T_{c}^{\rm onset} (induced by field or disorder) in thin films is often referred to as a Bose metal;[18] the purple bronze is an example of such behavior in a bulk superconductor.

To further characterize the Bose metal behavior, the metallic regime below T_{c}^{\rm onset} for the sample with the solid circles in the main panel of Fig. 3 is focused on next. Figure 4(a) reveals the magnetic-field induced metal-insulator transition (MIT) at H_{C}\sim 4600 Oe separating the metallic and insulating regimes. Metallic states below T_{c}^{\rm onset} and a MIT have been reported for disordered, superconducting MoGe and Ta films.[18, 19, 20, 21] Nonsuperconducting bulk graphite and Bi also re

  veal a MIT.[22] The insulating behavior in such systems has been experimentally tied to Cooper pairing.[23] In the inset, the temperature-independent metallic resistance is clearly visible for H=0, 0.7, and 1 kOe. Figure 4(b) shows magnetoresistance measurements at fixed temperatures from 0.4 to 0.9 K, in which the data intersect at H\sim 4600 Oe. In the absence of a proper fundamental theory to describe the MIT and Bose metal behavior, we apply the two-parameter scaling argument proposed by Das and Doniach.[21] By using the scaling parameters z=1 and \nu=4/3, reported for MoGe films,[21] and H_{c}=4600 Oe, a remarkable scaling collapse above and below the transition is observed [inset of Fig. 4(b)].

Conventional superconductivity, with boson formation and condensation at the same temperature, differs from superconductivity in a LL that has undergone dimensional crossover. In the latter, bosons (from two-fermion hopping) may form above T_{c} but the condensation temperature is essentially limited by the interchain hopping energy.[24] The bosons remain largely confined to 1D until the temperature drops below the interchain hopping energy, where superconductivity can occur. If the disorder is too strong, it is possible that the system does not Bose condense, becoming either a 3D Bose metal or even an insulator;[18] such behavior is confirmed in Figs. 2-4.

In summary, the temperature dependence of the electrical resistance of Li_{0.9}Mo_{6}O_{17}, including its minimum at T_{M}, lends itself to a simple description as a two-band LL. The \alpha_{a} band, responsible for the metallic regime above 28 K, undergoes an increase in dimensionality below T_{M^{\prime}} that eventually leads to superconductivity at 1.92 K. The unusual nature of superconductivity in Li_{0.9}Mo_{6}O_{17} is confirmed by the observation of Bose metal behavior.
