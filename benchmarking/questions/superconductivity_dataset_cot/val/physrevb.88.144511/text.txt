###### Abstract

Two new phases LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) and CeO\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) were obtained by growing single crystals in Bi flux. They adopt the tetragonal ZrCuSi\({}_{2}\)-type structure and feature Bi-square nets and PbO-type PdBi layers with significant partial Pd occupancy. Bulk superconductivity at 2.1 K and metallic behavior above \(T_{c}\) are observed in LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\). A small residual resistance ratio (RRR) indicates a strong scattering effect induced by the Pd vacancies, which implies an \(s\)-wave pairing symmetry in LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\). The broadening of the resistivity transition was measured under different magnetic fields demonstrating a high upper critical field of 3 T. Hall effect measurements reveal dominantly electron-like charge carriers and single-band transport behavior in LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\). The paramagnetic CeO\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) is nonsuperconducting but shows antiferromagnetic ordering below 6 K.

## I Introduction

The discovery of the iron-based superconductors with unconventional superconductivity has attracted great attention and triggered extensive research in the fields of condensed matter physics and materials science.[1] The family of the iron-based superconductors has been greatly expanded to several families such as the so-called 1111 phase (_Ln_FeAsO, _Ae_FeAsF, _Ln_ = rare earth elements, _Ae_ = alkaline earth elements),[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] (_Ae_Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), _Ae_ = alkaline earth elements),[5, 6] 111 phase (LiFeAs, NaFeAs) (Refs. [7, 8, 9]), and [11] phase (FeSe) (Ref. [10]), [34]42 phase (La\({}_{3}\)Ni\({}_{4}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{2}\)) (Ref. [11], 21311 phase (Sr\({}_{2}\)SO\({}_{3}\)FePt, Sr\({}_{2}\)VO\({}_{5}\)FeAs) (Ref. [12] and [13]), \(A_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2-y}\)Se\({}_{2}\) phase (_A_ = alkaline elements),[14] and so on. Among these, the common Fe\(x\)(\(X\) = pnictogen or chalcogen) layers are responsible for the superconductivity. Superconductivity was also observed in compounds with iron completely substituted by other 3\(d\), 4\(d\), or 5\(d\) transition metals.[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] After several 3\(d\), 4\(d\), 5\(d\) transition metal-phosphide, arsenide, germanide, or chalcogenide superconductors were discovered, attention has now focused on bismuthides and related systems.

Recently, polycrystalline CeNi\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) was reported to be superconducting at 4.2 K (Ref. [22]), and the authors argued that the light electron coming from the Bi square net is responsible for the superconductivity while the heavy electron from the Ni\({}_{1-x}\)Bi layer is responsible for the strong interaction with Ce 4\(f\) which yields the antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition. However, the results obtained on single crystals by another group were quite different.[23] Superconductivity was found only in the single crystals of LaNi\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\), whereas in single crystals of \(R\)Ni\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) (\(R\) = Ce-Nd, Sm, Gd-Dy) superconductivity was absent while local-moment-like behavior and AFM order were observed at low temperatures.

Here we report the magnetic, transport properties, and electronic structure calculations of LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) and CeO\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\), which exhibit strong vacancy defects in the square Pd sublattice. LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) is found to be superconducting at 2.1 K while CeO\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) has an AFM transition at 6 K.

## II Experimental details

Single-crystalline LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) and CeO\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) were grown using a self-flux method, similar to a previous synthesis of Ce\(T\)Bi\({}_{2}\) (\(T\) = Ni, Cu, Ag) (Ref. [24]). The starting materials La/Ce, Pd, and Bi with mole ratio of 1 : 1 : 12 and total mass of 3 grams were weighed, mixed, and placed in an alumina crucible. All handling was performed in a glove box with a protective argon atmosphere (both H\({}_{2}\)O and O\({}_{2}\) are limited below 0.1 ppm). Then the alumina crucible was jacketed by an evacuated silica tube. The tube was heated to 900\({}^{\circ}\) C in a box furnace and kept at 900\({}^{\circ}\) C for 10 hours. A slow-cooling process from 900\({}^{\circ}\) to 500\({}^{\circ}\) C was carried out and at 500\({}^{\circ}\) C the excess Bi flux was removed by centrifugation. The obtained crystals were shiny silver-color plates with a typical dimension of 5 x 5 x 0.5 mm.

A single-crystal x-ray diffraction (SCXRD) measurement was carried out on a STOE diffractometer. Data reducing was performed with the software x-area, and the structure was solved by direct methods using the shellxlt software.[25]

Powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected on a PANalytical diffractometer with \(\theta\)-2\(\theta\) scan at room temperature and analyzed by the Rietveld method with the gsas software.[26]

The magnetic susceptibility data for LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) were collected on a home-built superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) while those for CeOPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) were collected with the AC/DC Magnetometry System (ACMS) option on the Quantum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS).

Transport properties measurements including resistivity and the Hall effect were simultaneously performed with a standard six-probe method on the Quantum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS).

## III Results and discussion

### Crystal structure

Figure 1(a) shows the plate-like crystal habit of LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) and CeOPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) crystals obtained. Both LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) and CePd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) adopt the tetragonal ZrCuSi\({}_{2}\)-type structure and feature partial occupancy of Pd atoms as determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction, Fig. 1(b). The compositions are LaPd\({}_{0.85(2)}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) and CeOPd\({}_{0.782}\)Bi\({}_{2}\). The resulting structure parameters are listed in Table 1.

In the structure, the Pd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi layers adopt the same PbO-type structure as the FeAs layers, while the additional Bi atoms at the other kind of anionic sites form an extended Bi square net. We sparingly raise the possibility of charge density wave (CDW) in the Bi square net since CDW is frequently observed in anionic square nets (e.g., Te or Ga square net).[27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32] Electronic calculations (to be discussed later) on stoichiometric LaPdBi\({}_{2}\) indicate the possibility of Fermi surface nesting which is important for CDW formation.[33, 34, 35]

The room-temperature PXRD patterns and the Rietveld refinements for the ground samples of LaPd\({}_{0.85(2)}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) and CeOPd\({}_{0.78(2)}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) are shown in Fig. 1(c). We found the crystals are malleable during grinding which makes the \(hk\) containing Bragg peaks broad. Figure 1(d) presents the 00\(l\) reflections on the fresh-cleaved surfaces of crystals, which indicates the surfaces of the LaPd\({}_{0.85(2)}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) and CeOPd\({}_{0.78(2)}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) crystals correspond to the \(ab\) plane. All transport properties discussed later were measured with the electric current parallel to the \(ab\) plane and the field perpendicular to the \(ab\) plane. The 00\(l\) peaks are very sharp, indicating excellent crystalline quality. The slight peak shift towards higher Bragg angles in the case of CeOPd\({}_{0.78(2)}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) is due to the lanthanide contraction rule.

### Resistivity and magnetic susceptibility

The temperature dependence of resistivity for LaPd0.85(2)Bi2 is plotted in Fig. 2(a). A superconducting transition occurs at around 2 K (zero-resistivity point), and the transition is displayed more precisely in Fig. 3 with the temperature region from 0 to 10 K. Metallic behavior exists in the normal state: The resistivity shows a linear relationship with the temperature above 30 K and levels off to a constant value (the so-called residual resistivity) below 30 K. Dividing the resistivity at 300 K by the resistivity at \(T_{c}\)(onset), we can get the residual resistance ratio (RRR) of 2.45. The relatively small RRR indicates a strong scattering effect in the conductive layers. Considering the partial Pd occupancy in the lattice, we think the strong electron scattering is brought by the Pd vacancies in the Pd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi layers. The Pd vacancies can be thought of as nonmagnetic impurities and play the role of scattering centers. In a conventional superconductor with \(s\)-wave pairing symmetry, the nonmagnetic impurities will not lead to an apparent pair-breaking effect, therefore no quasiparticle density of states (DOS) can be generated at the Fermi energy. This was called Anderson's theorem.[36] In sharp contrast, in a \(d\)-wave superconductor, nonmagnetic impurities can induce a high DOS due to the existence of nodes. Based on this point, the superconductivity in LaPd0.85(2)Bi2 is likely \(s\) wave. However, more work will be required to further explore this point. In Fig. 2(b), we present the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility showing the demagnetization effect. A full diamagnetic shield is achieved below 2.1 K which corresponds to the zero-resistivity point mentioned above. So, below 2.1 K the superconductivity is bulk, and above 2.1 K superconducting fluctuation of sample inhomogeneity may account for the transition width in the resistivity.

The temperature dependence of resistivity for CeO\({}_{0.78\Omega}\))Bi2 is also displayed in Fig. 2(c) for comparison. Above 75 K, the in-plane resistivity shows a linear behavior and weak temperature dependence, similar to LaPd0.85(2)Bi2. However, a sharp peak corresponding to the AFM transition is observed at 6 K. The temperature dependence of molar magnetic susceptibility \(\chi(T)\) and its inverse \(1/\chi\) for CeO\({}_{0.78\Omega}\))Bi2 measured in a field of 0.2 T is shown in Fig. 2(d). The AFM ordering of the Ce moments below 6 K is confirmed by the peak at 6 K in \(\chi(T)\), and the high-temperature susceptibility obeys the simple Curie-Weiss law \(\chi=C/(T\cdot\Theta_{P})\). From the fitting process with the Curie-Weiss law, a paramagnetic Curie temperature of \(\Theta_{P}=-1.5\) K and an effective magnetic moment of \(\mu_{\rm eff}=2.86\ \mu_{B}/\)Ce are obtained. The negative \(\Theta_{P}\) suggests a tendency toward antiferromagnetic correlation between the Ce moments at high temperatures. The value of \(\mu_{\rm eff}\) is very close to that of CeNiBi2 (Ref. [37]) and comparable to the expected value for a free Ce\({}^{3+}\) ion (2.54 \(\mu_{B}/\)Ce), which indicates that the magnetic moments of Ce are well localized in the compound.

### Upper critical field

To obtain the upper critical field for LaPd0.85(2)Bi2, we carried out the resistivity measurements at different applied magnetic fields. The original data are plotted in the main frame of Fig. 3. We use the criterion of 90%\(\rho_{u}\) to estimate the upper critical field based on the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory,[38] as shown in the inset of Fig. 3. The following equation has been extracted from the GL theory: \(H_{c2}(T)=H_{c2}(0)\times(1-t^{2})/(1+t^{2})\), where \(t=T/T_{c}\) is the reduced temperature and \(H_{c2}(0)\) is the upper critical field at zero temperature. The measured data in the inset of Fig. 3 were well fitted using the equation above (red solid line). The zero-temperature upper critical field was determined to be 3 T from the fit. This \(H_{c2}(0)\) value is quite large relative to the low \(T_{c}\), so we conclude LaPd0.85(2)Bi2 is a type-II superconductor.

The inset shows the upper critical fields as a function of temperature. The red solid line indicates the theoretical fitting based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory.

(d) Temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility \(\chi(T)\) and its inverse \(1/\chi\) for CeO\({}_{0.78\Omega}\))Bi2 measured with the field perpendicular to the \(ab\) plane.

 

### Hall effect

To get a deeper understanding of the conducting carriers in the LaPd\({}_{0.85(2)}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) phase, we measured the Hall effect. The inset of Fig. 4 shows the magnetic-field dependence of Hall resistivity \(\rho_{xy}\) at different temperatures. In the experiment, \(\rho_{xy}\) was taken as \(\rho_{xy}=[\rho(+H)-\rho(-H)]/2\) at each point to eliminate the effect of the possible misalignment of Hall electrodes. The temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient \(R_{H}\) is plotted in the main frame of Fig. 4. The Hall coefficient \(R_{H}\) is negative and nearly constant over the whole temperature range. The negative sign of \(R_{H}\) shows that electron-type charge carriers dominate the charge transport. Taking the average value of \(R_{H}=1.7\times 10^{-4}\) cm\({}^{3}\)/C into the equation \(R_{H}=1/ne\), we can get the electron concentration \(n=3.7\times 10^{22}\) /cm\({}^{3}\). That the \(R_{H}\) is almost independent of temperature indicates largely a single-band character. This view needs to be confirmed by temperature-dependent angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).

## IV Band structure calculations

Electronic structure calculations were performed on the stoichiometric LaPdBi\({}_{2}\) model using the self-consistent full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method (LAPW) [39] within density functional theory (DFT), [40, 41] using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof [42] for the exchange and correlation potential. The values of the atomic radii were taken to be 2.6 a.u. for all atoms where a.u. is the atomic unit (0.529 A). The convergence of the self-consistent iterations was performed for 630 \(k\) points inside the irreducible Brillouin zone to within 0.0001 Ry with a cutoff of \(-6.0\) Ry between the valence and the core states. Scalar relativistic corrections were included and a spin-orbit interaction was incorporated using a second variational procedure. [43] The calculations were performed using the wien2k program. [44]

Band structure calculations at the DFT level confirmed the metallic character of the LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) system, as shown in Fig. 5. In the fully stoichiometric LaPdBi\({}_{2}\), bands near the Fermi level are dispersive (see Fig. 6) where La, Bi(1) (in the PbO-type layer), and Bi(2) (in the square net) bands have almost equal contribution at the Fermi level. Pd bands on the other hand dominate at the Fermi level with almost double the contribution with respect to the other atoms.

Consequently, any change in the concentration of Pd atoms in LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) will strongly affect the Fermi surface, as shown in Fig. 7. The number of bands crossing the Fermi level varies with \(x\) value. In more detail: There are ten bands crossing the Fermi energy for \(x=0\), six bands for \(x=0.043\), six bands for \(x=0.065\), four bands for \(x=0.108\), six bands for \(x=0.130\), and eight bands for \(x=0.150\).

 calculations support the possibility of Fermi surface nesting near the fully stoichiometric case in LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\). By creating Pd vacancies the Fermi surface nesting is avoided which suppresses any potential CDW on the Bi net. Such kinds of suppression of a putative CDW may drive the LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) system to superconductivity. The electronic structure and Fermi surface topology of LaPdBi\({}_{2}\) is quite different from those in SrMnBi\({}_{2}\) (Ref. [45]), a related compound which also has a Bi net but crystallizes in a different space group. In the later, Bi states dominate at the Fermi level where a more equitable contribution from all atoms at the Fermi level is suggested in LaPdBi\({}_{2}\).

## V Conclusion

Bulk superconductivity at 2.1 K was discovered in LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) while CePd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) has an AFM transition at 6 K. The partial Pd occupancy determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction leads to a strong scattering effect in the conductive layers of LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) and CePd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\). According to Anderson's theorem,[36] the strong scattering effect implies the superconductivity in LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) is \(s\)-wave symmetric. The upper critical field of 3 T strongly recommends LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) is a type-II superconductor. The temperature independence of the Hall coefficient may suggest a single-band dominates the transport in LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\). On the other hand, the absence of superconductivity and the appearance of AFM order below 6 K in CePd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) jointly suggest the superconductivity and magnetism are not able to coexist. The \(R\)Pd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) system (\(R=\) La, Ce) and the iron-based superconductors have not only similarities but also differences. (1) The iron-based superconductors have the so-called \(s\pm\) state with the pairing symmetry being \(s\) wave but a sign change occurring between different bands.[46, 47] Similarly, our LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) is also likely \(s\)-wave symmetric. (2) By contrast the \(f\)-\(d\) hybridization in CePd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) quenches the superconductivity as, for example, in CeOFeP and EuFe\({}_{2-x}\)Co\({}_{x}\)As\({}_{2}\) (Refs. [48, 49]), (3) In the iron-based superconductors the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity widely exists,[50] but in LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) no magnetism is found. (4) In the iron-based superconductors the interband scattering of electrons induced by spin fluctuation plays an important role in the origin of superconductivity,[51, 52, 53] but in LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) no such interband scattering is present since single-band dominates its transport. Instead, the Pd orbital contribution is dominant at the Fermi level, which, coupled with Pd vacancies, may be important for superconductivity. Considering the different features between LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) and iron-based superconductors, we suggest that LaPd\({}_{1-x}\)Bi\({}_{2}\) have a differing electron phonon coupling mechanism than the one in iron-based superconductors.
