###### Abstract

Studies of the electrical transport properties\(-\)resistivity, Hall effect, and Seebeck coefficient\(-\) of the hexagonal tungsten bronze Rb_x_WO3 for \(0.16\leq x\leq 0.33\) are reported for the temperature range from 1.5 to 300 K. In the normal state, these properties show temperature-dependent anomalies which suggest a phase transition with temperature. The temperature at which this transition occurs is shown to depend on the Rb concentration, exhibiting a sharp maximum near \(x=0.25\). As the Rb concentration is decreased below \(x=0.33\) the superconducting transition temperature first increases above the value of 1.94 K at \(x=0.33\) and then decreases to less than 1 K at \(x=0.24\). As the Rb concentration is lowered further a second increase in \(T_{c}\) is observed. This behavior appears to be associated with a phase transition at a composition near \(x=0.25\). The nature of neither the transition with temperature nor the transition with concentration could be precisely determined. The superconducting state shows a large temperature-independent 60\({}^{\circ}\) anisotropy in \(H_{e2}\) in the plane perpendicular to the hexagonal axis and positive curvature in the temperature dependence of \(H_{e2}\) near \(T_{c}\).

## 1 Introduction

The electronic and structural properties of the _d_-band metals have received much recent attention.[1] One class of materials which fall within this broad classification is the tungsten bronzes, which are non-stoichiometric compounds of the general formula \(M_{\alpha}\)WO3 where \(M\) is one of a number of metal ions and \(x\) ranges from near 0 to 1. These materials crystallize in several different symmetries depending upon the size and valence of the ion \(M\), and its concentration \(x\).

The majority of the studies of the tungsten bronzes have centered on the cubic phase.[2] Of the elements for which this phase is possible, Na_x_WO3 has been studied in the most detail.

In this study, results are presented on the hexagonal tungsten bronze (HTB) Rb_x_WO3, which show it to have vastly different properties from those found in the cubic phase. In the hexagonal phase, WO6 octahedra form 3- and 6-membered rings as shown in Fig. 1, leaving trigonal and hexagonal channels along the \(c\) axis. The radius of the hexagonal cavities is 2.00 A, and will accomodate ions up to this size. These ions are believed to donate their valence electrons to the tungsten \(5d(t_{12})\) conduction band.[3] Many elements can be inserted into the hexagonal channels, although special techniques are required in some cases. The concentration range for which the hexagonal bronzes are believed to exist is \(0.13\leq x\leq 0.33\). The lower concentration has been estimated to be the thermodynamic phase limit[4]; however, in recent work Hussain was not able to produce hexagonal tungsten bronze (HTB) for \(x<0.19\).[5] The upper limit on \(x\) is set by complete filling of the hexagonal channels, and most previous studies of the hexagonal phase of Rb_x_WO3 have been at or near this upper limit.

The resistivity, \(\rho\), of Rb_x_WO3 has been the subject of several investigations. Sienko and Morehouse[6] found a room-temperature resistivity of \((6.3\pm 0.9)\times 10^{-5}\) ohm cm at \(x=0.33\) and an almost linear increase in \(\rho\) from 150 to 350 K. Sweedler[7] noted a linear rise in \(\rho\) above 50 K on a sample reported to be Rb0.27WO3. King _et al.[8]_ have reported anisotropy in \(\rho\) for Rb0.33WO3, giving values at room temperature of \(6.3\times 10^{-5}\) ohm cm along the \(c\) axis, and \(3.6\times 10^{-4}\) ohm cm perpendicular to it. Their best samples gave linear \(\rho\) vs \(T\) behavior above about 40 K, with residual resistivity ratios (RRR) of \(\approx\)60.

 Sweedler has observed a RRR of 236 on the samples described above and Stanley _et al._9 have found a RRR of about 4 for Rb0.20WO3.

The resistivity of another HTB, InaWO3, showed anomalous flattening in the \(c\) axis resistivity at about 215 K, and anisotropy of the _a_- and _c_-axis resistivities.10

The Hall coefficient of Na2WO3 (cubic and tetragonal phases) indicates that somewhat less than one electron is donated by the metal ion to the WO6 conduction band with no variation of \(R_{H}\) with \(T\) in the region 1-300 K.11 There are no reports of the Hall coefficient having been measured for any HTB.

Superconductivity was first observed in Rb2WO3 by Sweedler _et al._12 They observed \(T_{c}\) = 2 K and D_T__c_ = 0.27 K for \(x\) > 0.3 by ac susceptibility studies. Remeika _et al._13 found that \(T_{c}\) could be raised from 2.3 to values in excess of 7 K by acid leaching of some of the Rb. In contrast, Shanks and Danielson14 have reported a linear decrease in \(T_{c}\) as \(x\) is lowered from 0.33 to 0.26. A completely different variation of \(T_{c}\) with \(x\) has been reported by Wanlass and Sienko.15 They find that \(T_{c}\) rises from 2 K (_x_ = 0.33) to 2.8 K (_x_ = 0.30), and then falls sharply to below 1.2 K (_x_ = 0.28). No superconductivity was reported above 1.2 K between \(x\) = 0.28 and \(x\) = 0.24, whereupon \(T_{c}\) rose rapidly to 4.3 K (_x_ = 0.20).

The effect of a magnetic field on the superconducting properties of Rb2WO3 has been studied to some extent. Remeika _et al._13 have reported high values of _H__c_2 in an etched sample at 4.2 K (_x_ unknown). Wanlass and Sienko15 have employed ac susceptibility techniques on crushed powder samples and show that the upper critical field increases as \(x\) is lowered. Single-crystal anisotropies in _H__c_2 have been observed by Skokan _et al._16 in Cs0.1WO2.5F0.1, which has the same structure as Rb2WO3. Similar anisotropies have been observed by Stanley _et al._ in Rb0.20WO3.9

Much lower critical fields have been observed by Bevolo _et al._17 at the filled limit, \(x\) = 0.33, and their observation of a latent heat in specific-heat measurements taken in a magnetic field led them to conclude that Rb0.31WO3 is a type-I superconductor.

The specific-heat measurements of Kienzle _et al._,18 King _et al._,8 and Bevolo _et al._17 have shown that Rb0.33WO3 obeys the simple relation \(C = \gamma T + bT^{3}\) for the sum of the electronic and lattice components of the specific heat, between 2 and 3 K. At higher temperatures, an excess heat capacity is observed which they attributed to the presence of Einstein-like modes associated with the Rb ions. These investigators have obtained a Debye temperature of about 415 K, and an Einstein temperature, ThE, of 57 K for Rb0.31WO3 from their data. On etched samples, King _et al._8 have observed that ThE is about 67 K for \(x\) = 0.2.

Of the measurements outlined above, only those of Wanlass and Sienko15 and Hussain5 were taken on samples not grown electrolytically from Rb2CO3 and WO3, or similar mixtures which will produce this HTB. Attempts to produce low-_x_ HTB by etching these high-_x_ samples has produced some confusion as to their \(x\) value, and to the homogeneity of the resulting crystals. Calorimetric measurements of \(T_{c}\) have given conflicting results.8,17

Some preliminary results on the work described in this paper have been reported previously.19

## II Experimental procedures

We have grown Rb2WO3 by solid-state reaction, and have been able to produce crystals with nominal \(x\) values as low as 0.16. 2\(\frac{1}{2}\) g of starting material were made up from high-purity Rb2WO4, W, and WO3 and placed in quartz tubes which had been cleaned with hydrofluoric acid and distilled deionized water, and pumped to 10-7 Torr overnight at 1100 degC. The starting mixture was pumped for 13-18 h at (2-8) x 10-7 Torr before the tube was sealed. The mixtures were then heated at 950 degC for 5 days. The crystals which grew varied in appearance from long thin needles to short hexagonal prisms. Two batches at \(x\) = 0.22 and \(x\) = 0.28 were grown from Rb2CO3, WO3, and W by first driving off the CO2. As will be shown these samples had some different properties from those grown from Rb2WO4.

The Rb concentrations were checked by x-ray fluorescence analysis. The ratio of the counts in the Rb [_K__a_] to those in the W [_L__a_] peaks was found for each spectrum and compared with a calibration spectrum. Because of the failure to obtain a good calibration spectrum using mixtures of Rb2WO4 and WO3, several small crystals of Rb0.31WO3 were run in a number of configurations and the Rb to W ratio of 0.33 was used as a standard. For each concentration a number of samples were measured and although there was some spread in measured \(x\) values, in all cases the nominal value was within the standard deviation (less than 5%) of the mean measured value. In the rest of this paper the nominal values will be used when denoting concentrations.

For resistivity measurements, samples were washed with acetone and weighed before being mounted for 4-lead measurements. All leads were attached with conducting silver paint, and when necessary currents up to 100 mA were passed through all the contacts to establish continuity. The cross-sectional area was calculated using the sample mass, length, and density. The density, calculated using the measured lattice parameters and the nominal Rb concentrations, obeys the linear relation, density = 6.483 + 2.513\(x\) g/cm3, to a linearity of better than 0.5% and an absolute accurate of about 1%. Resistive measurements were made in a helium-exchange gas system with current densities of typically 100 A/cm2.

  Hall-effect data was taken on several samples with current densities of several hundred A/cm2 along the \(c\) axis, and a field of 11.5 kOe. Isenberg[20] geometry corrections were applied to those samples where accurate dimensions could be measured, but for several concentrations the inability to measure the sample geometry made the determination of absolute values of \(R_{H}\) impossible.

Seebeck-coefficient data has been taken for most concentrations from 90 to 300 K using copper-Constantam thermocouples for temperature measurement.

For the superconducting properties, we have measured \(T_{e}\) resistively using current densities of about 10 A/cm2, and also inductively by the ac susceptibility method of Schawlaw and Devlin.[21] With a resonant frequency of 0.12 MHz, the skin depth of Rb2WO3 is about 0.9 mm, which is far larger than our samples.

The value of \(T_{e}\) for Rb2.24WO3 was determined by researchers at the Naval Research Laboratory[22] (NRL) and lattice-parameter measurements were made there as well as the University of California, San Diego.[23]

## III Experimental Results

### Normal-state properties

Lattice-parameter studies gave \(c\) and \(a\) axes which are in general agreement with reported values,[5] although those measured at NRL were smaller than those reported by other investigators. All samples measured were single phase. As the Rb concentration was decreased there was a decrease in line intensities and a broadening of the lines which would seem to indicate more disorder in the crystals; however relative line intensities were unchanged. Only normal Debye-Waller intensity increases were observed with decreasing temperature giving no indication of any temperature-dependent phase changes.[23] For \(x\) = 0.26 one line showed an anomalous increase in intensity but its meaning could not be determined.

To check that the resistivity of Rb3.3WO3 grown by solid-state reaction (SSR) is similar to that of the same material grown electrolytically, we have measured 9 samples from \(T_{e}\) to 300 K. Typical temperature dependence of the resistivity of Rb3.3WO3 is shown in sample 33(12) in Fig. 2, with the average for the resistivity for all samples at 300 K being (6.56 +- 0.53) x 10-5 ohm cm. This compares very favorably with the values of 6.3 x 10-5 ohm cm quoted by two other investigators.[6, 8] Resistivity ratios of 20 to 30 were found for these samples, and the mean temperature coefficient of the resistivity at 300 K was 3.87 x 10-3 K-1.

Figure 3(a) shows the resistivity at 4 K as a function of Rb concentration. The thermal contribution to the resistivity at 300 K (_r_300 K - \(r\)4 K) is shown in Fig. 3(b). Except for the Rb0.22WO3, which was grown from carbonate material and the Rb0.16WO3, \(r\)4 K rises monotonically but not linearly as \(x\) is decreased below 0.33. The value of \(r\)300 K - \(r\)4 K for the carbonate grown \(x\) = 0.22 is consistent with the other samples.

Figure 2 also indicates that at all concentrations below \(x\) = 0.33, there is an anomalous hump in the resistivity. The temperature at which this anomaly

  occurs, as well as its magnitude depends on the \(x\) value. The position of the minimum in the resistivity, \(T_{B}\), is indicated by arrows for each concentration. The sample number gives the nominal Rb concentration. All the \(r\) vs \(T\) data were taken with current along the \(c\) axis except for the data on samples 16(6), which represents the resistivity in the _a_-_b_ plane. The lack of any anomaly in this sample when compared to sample 16(3) in which the current is along the \(c\) axis would appear to indicate that the anomaly is unique to conduction along the \(c\) axis.

We have observed that the starting materials and residual resistance ratios do not seriously affect \(T_{B}\). In Fig. 4, we present two plots for samples of Rb0.28WO3 grown from Rb2WO4 and Rb2CO3. The sample grown from Rb2CO3, 28(4), has a resistance ratio of 1.93, while that grown from Rb2WO4 has a higher resistance ratio of 3.27. Figure 4 indicates that while \(T_{B}\) is not seriously affected by the starting materials, the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{e}\) is.

The variation in \(T_{B}\) with \(x\) is shown in Fig. 5 where the error bars on the \(T_{B}\) axis represent the maximum spread of our data for all the samples which we have investigated. Such a spread in \(T_{B}\) could easily be accounted for by slight variations in the \(x\) values of the samples used. As can be seen, \(T_{B}\) shows a sharp peak at \(x\) = 0.25. The anomalous hump in the resistivity is indicative of a phase transition with temperature for which the transition temperature is concentration dependent. However, x-ray diffraction measurements of lattice parameters above and below \(T_{B}\) show no change to within 0.0025 A.22,23

Figure 6 shows the effect of the phase transition at \(T_{B}\) on the Hall and Seebeck coefficients. Good agreement exists at all concentrations between the temperatures at which slopes of the Hall and Seebeck plots change, and \(T_{B}\) of the resistivity plot.

The Hall coefficient at room temperature is \(R_{H}\) = -(1.97 +- 0.01) x 10-9 m3/C, and use of \(R_{H}\) = 1/_ne_ yields \(n\) = (3.17 +- 0.16) x 1027 electrons/m3, or 1.12 +- 0.056 electrons/(unit cell). The size of the unit cell at this concentration is 3.5435 x 10-28 m3. The _6x_ Rb atoms/(unit cell) with one electron per atom give a calculated value of electron concentration of 1.08 electrons/(unit cell), which is very close to our measured value, and consistent with the idea that the Rb atom donates its \(s\) electron to the WO6 conduction band. Above \(T_{B}\), \(R_{H}\) is essentially independent of temperature, but below \(T_{B}\), \(R_{H}\) rises linearly, suggesting a change in the electronic character of the material at \(T_{B}\) and either a continuing decrease in electron concentration or mobility as the temperature falls.

The behavior of the Seebeck coefficient shown for Rb0.18WO3 in Fig. 6 is typical of all concentrations below \(x\) = 0.33. Above the transition the coefficient is almost temperature independent while below the transition it decreases rapidly. At \(x\) = 0.33, we have found that the Seebeck coefficient does not flatten

  out at high temperature, as for all lower concentrations, but follows the linear relationship \(-S = 4.55 + 5.84 \times 10^{- 2}T\)\(\mu\)V/K between 80 and 300 K, a temperature variation which seems more typical of a good metal, but with a relatively high room-temperature coefficient of about \(- 20 \pm 3\)\(\mu\)V/K. As \(x\) decreases the coefficient at 300 K increases rapidly. The variation of \(S\) as a function of \(x^{- 2/3}\) is shown in Fig. 7. Error bars represent the standard deviation in the data, and the straight line is the best fit to five of the points. The simple free-electron theory predicts \(S \propto n^{- 2/3}\),[24] where \(n\) is the number of conduction electrons.

### Superconducting properties

The results of our investigation of the variation of \(T_{e}\) with \(x\) on single-crystal samples is shown in Fig. 8, along with results from earlier investigations. In most cases, the \(T_{e}\)'s were measured resistively. The inset table gives the transition widths, \(\Delta T_{e}\), defined as 10%\(-\)90% of the restored resistance. Transition widths quoted by Shanks and Danielson,[14] and by Wanlass and Sienko,[15] are given with their data points.

Our data suggest that superconductivity in Rb\({}_{x}\)WO\({}_{3}\) is a very complicated phenomenon. At \(x=0.33\) all samples had very narrow transitions widths and a \(T_{e}\) near 2 K which is in agreement with the values reported by all other investigators. For concentrations below \(x=0.33\) down to \(x=0.26\), the dependency of \(T_{e}\) on concentration is not clear. Samples of a given concentration in this range showed considerable variation in the \(T_{e}\)'s. The dashed line for \(x\geq 0.26\) represents the approximate maximum \(T_{e}\)'s observed, but also as shown values considerably less than these maximum values were also seen. For example, for \(x=0.26\), some batches superconduct above 7 K, some at 5 K and some not above 1.5 K. Similar behavior is seen at \(x=0.27\). In this concentration range the transition widths also were considerably broader than at \(x=0.33\) or for \(x<0.25\). For \(x\leq 0.25\), where transitions could be observed, they were relatively narrow and did not show the scatter exhibited at the higher concentrations. In this range the transition temperature again rises to a value in excess of 4.5 K at \(x=0.16\).

The scattered results for \(0.26\leq x<0.33\) cannot be fully explained. \(T_{e}\)'s measured using ac susceptibility were often less than those measured resistively which would seem to indicate the possibility of some type of surface superconductivity. Although we have not been able to answer this question, we find it strange that the maximum \(T_{e}\)'s would scale with concentration the way that they are observed to do and also that this behavior is confined only to the region \(0.26\leq x<0.33\).

In spite of these uncertainties, the drop in \(T_{e}\) near \(x=0.25\) and the subsequent increase again at lower concentrations coupled with the peak observed in \(T_{B}\) at this same concentration as shown in Fig. 5 are suggestive of a concentration-dependent phase transition.

We have also investigated the effect of Rb concentration on the \(c\) axis and basal plane anisotropies in \(H_{e2}\). We find that anisotropies in both planes are

The solid squares and rectangles are present data and represent the spread in observed values. The dashed curve for \(0.25\leq x\leq 0.33\) corresponds to the maximum \(T_{e}\) observed in different crystals of a given composition. \(T_{e}\)’s measured for the Rb\({}_{x}\)WO\({}_{3}\) system by other investigators are also given.

  present throughout the entire range of \(x\), although we were unable to obtain good absolute values for _H__e_2 for those concentrations with wide superconducting transitions. Figure 9(a) shows the basal plane anisotropy of _H_e for 2 samples of Rb0,33WO3 with the field normalized to _H_e(_ph_ = 60 deg). The table inset into Fig. 9 shows the reduced temperature at which the data was taken, and the values of the critical field at _ph_ = 30 deg and 60 deg. The angle _ph_ is defined in Fig. 1. These critical fields are the smallest that we have observed in the Rb_x_WO3 system. Since the critical fields are small and Bevolo _et al._17 suggests that Rb0,33WO3 is a type-I superconductor, the critical-field data at the orientations _ph_ = 60 deg and 30 deg in Fig. 9(b) were fit to the prediction of the BCS theory by matching the slopes, _dH_e/_dT_, at \(t\) = 1. The slopes at \(t\) = 1, the critical fields at \(t\) = 0.8, and the anisotropy \(A\), which we have defined as

\[A = \left\{ {\frac{{H_e(60\,^{\circ} - {H_e(30\,^{\circ} )} }}{{H_e(60\,^{\circ} + {H_e(30\,^{\circ} )} } )}} \right\}_{{t_ = 0.8}}\]

are given for \(x\) = 0.33 and other concentrations in Table 1. For the \(x\) = 0.33 samples, excellent agreement is observed between the field parameters at _ph_ = 30 deg. The values at _ph_ = 60 deg are larger in all cases but show considerable variation. The slope of the critical field versus temperature at \(T_{e}\) for Rb0,33WO3 has also been measured by Bevolo _et al._,17 although the orientation of their sample to the field was un

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c} Sample & \(T_{e}\) & \({\phi = 60\,^{\circ}}\) & & & & _ph_ = 30\({}^{\circ}\) & \\ (K) & (kOe/K) & (kOe) & (kOe) & (kOe/K) & (kOe) & (kOe) & (kOe) & (kOe) & \\
18(1) & 4.15 & 4.72 & 13.4 & 8.70 & 3.86 & 10.90 & 3.40 & 0.44 \\

Anisotropy in \(H_{\rm e2}\) has been the subject of many recent investigations,[25] but the HTB show the first 60\({}^{\circ}\) anisotropy of \(H_{\rm e2}\) in an hexagonal metal. Kostorz _et al.[26]_ have searched for anisotropy in \(H_{\rm e2}\) in the hcp metal \({}^{97}\)Tc, but found none.

In Fig. 10 is shown critical-field rotation data which is typical for all concentrations below \(x=0.33\). Field parameters for a number of concentrations are given in Table 1. The enhanced values of \(H_{\rm e2}\) found at \(\phi = 0^{\circ}\) and 180\({}^{\circ}\) were observed in a number of samples and may be due to the planar shape of the samples.

The larger values of \(H_{\rm e2}\) below \(x=0.33\) indicate that the materials are probably type-II superconductors; thus we have estimated \(H_{\rm e2}(0)\) by fitting the slope of our data at \(t=1\) to the Maki theory for dirty type-II superconductors.[27] As illustrated in Fig. 10 there is an upward positive curvature in much of our critical field versus temperature data near \(t=1\), which may in many cases render our estimates of \(H_{\rm e2}(0)\) too low. This curvature is generally not observed below \(t=0.8\).

An examination of the Table 1 yields a number of interesting facts. When the concentration is decreased to 0.32, all the field parameters increase from \(x=0.33\) values. Our estimates of \(H_{\rm e2}(0)\) are 415 Oe at \(\phi=60^{\circ}\) and 358 Oe at \(\phi=30^{\circ}\), which are again lower than the value of 925 Oe quoted by Wanlass and Sienko.[15]

When the concentration is decreased to the region below \(x=0.24\) the critical-field parameters increase significantly giving \(H_{\rm e2}(0)\) values as high as 14 kOe. We have measured field data on samples grown by SSR from both Rb2WO4 and Rb2CO3. The samples 22(\(R1\)) and 22(\(2\)) are from a batch of Rb0.22WO3 grown from Rb2CO3. As shown in Table 1, the anisotropy is depressed in these samples as compared to samples grown from the Rb2WO3. Field rotation plots and field dependence fits for Rb0.20WO3 were presented in our earlier report.[9]

Measurements of the critical fields for fields in the plane of the \(c\) axis are given in Table 2 and typical behavior is illustrated in Fig. 11. Extrapolated value at the zero-resistance baseline of the tangent through the point of inflection in the restored resistance versus applied field curves was taken as the value of \(H_{\rm e2}\). These values represent a lower limit of \(H_{\rm e2}\). For Rb0.33WO3, the slope, \(-dH/dT\), at \(T_{\rm c}\) for sample 33(6) at \(\theta=0\) is 320 Oe/K which is considerably larger than the values for \(\theta=90^{\circ}\) at \(\phi=30^{\circ}\) and \(60^{\circ}\). The BCS estimate of \(H_{\rm e}(0)\) is 297 Oe, and the aniso

were 0.49 and 0.47. As in the case of the _ph_ variation, this anisotropy was found to be essentially temperature independent.

The difference between samples of Rb0.22WO3 grown from Rb2CO3 and Rb2WO4 is again seen in Table 2. For sample 22(1), made from Rb2CO3, the anisotropy is much less than that of sample 22(7), made from Rb2WO4 in agreement with what was observed in the hexagonal plane.

Since our field measurements were limited to 12 kOe in these experiments, we have had to estimate three values of _H_(_t_ = 0.8) for samples 20(1), 20(6), and 18(4) (see Fig. 11), and these are denoted by (_ex_) in Table 2. The large amount of positive curvature for sample 18(4) makes it impossible to estimate _H__e_2(0) for this sample.

## IV Discussion

The basic resistivity mechanisms in the HTB have not previously been thoroughly investigated. Rb0.33WO3 shows no indication of the anomalous hump in the temperature dependence of the resistivity found at lower concentrations and thus its behavior is taken to reflect the basic conduction properties of the HTB. Above 100 K the resistivity rises in an essentially linear manner with temperature. This can be compared to the cubic system Na2WO3 where _dp_/_dT_ increases continuously up to 870 K. However, the electron mobility at 300 K in Rb0.33WO3, calculated assuming one electron per Rb atom, which the Hall data appears to justify, is 17.0 cm2/V sec. This is the same order of magnitude as the mobility found in the Na system and suggests a common transport mechanism for all the tungsten bronzes. Sienko and Morehouse [6] attempted to attribute the temperature dependence of the resistivity in Rb0.33WO3 to the polar scattering of conduction electrons from optical phonons, a model which had been successful in explaining the behavior in WO3, an _n_-type semiconductor. In the region above 150 K, their model appears to give a good fit to the data but it fails to explain the large temperature variation of \(r\) at low temperatures found in this work, which shows an approximate \(T\)3 dependence below 50 K (two samples gave exponents of 2.81 and 2.91, respectively).

King _et al._[8] measured a Debye temperature in Rb0.33WO3 at 415 K. However the concept of a Debye temperature for the HTB is complicated by the crystal structure which allows for the vibration of the Rb ions within the channels in the host lattice of WO6 octahedra. Heat-capacity studies suggest the Rb ions vibrate in Einstein-like modes with a characteristic temperature of 57 K. Inelastic neutron scattering studies have recently confirmed the existence of such Einstein-like modes.[28] For a Debye temperature above 400 K, the lattice contribution to the resistivity should show a continually increasing contribution with temperature in the region investigated, as is the case in Na2WO3. However, a large contribution from the scattering due to Einstein modes with _thE_ = 57 K could result in a linear increase in resistivity at high temperatures since \(r\) _r_ _T_/_thE_ above _thE_. The approximate \(T\)3 dependence of \(r\) at low temperatures is also not inconsistent with scattering predominantly from the Einstein-like modes of the Rb ions, especially in view of the relatively large scatter in the data.

As shown in the figure, over the range of concentrations investigated, the resistivity follows the Nordheim relation29 for the resistivity of alloys, i.e.,

\[\rho_{4} \propto x(0.33-x)\;\;,\]

where the Rb ions and the vacancies play the role of the alloy constituents.

Any consideration of the phase change at concentrations below \(x\) = 0.33 has been neglected in this fitting and it seems somewhat strange that the residual resistance in Rb0.33WO3, which does not show the transition, should be in agreement with the lower concentrations which do show a transition. The most significant difference seems to show up in the residual resistance ratios, where Rb0.33WO3 had ratios as high as 30 whereas for concentrations \(x\) = 0.30 and below, RRR's were around 3-4. The high value of the residual resistivity in the carbonate grown Rb0.22WO3 sample would indicate a significant increase in the impurities in this material. The room-temperature lattice resistivity, however, is consistent with noncarbonate grown crystals indicating that the impurities do not appreciably affect the temperature-dependent resistivity. The high-resistivity value for the \(x\) = 0.16 sample probably reflects a significant increase in lattice distortion as the phase limit is approached or possibly the phase separation of the nominal \(x\) = 0.16 into a mixture of Rb_x_WO3 with \(x\) > 0.16 and WO3 as has been previous observed.5 X-ray diffraction studies were not done on this concentration, thus the question cannot be answered for certain.

At all concentrations below \(x\) = 0.33, a hump appears in the resistivity, the position and magnitude of which depend strongly on the concentration. Corresponding anomalies which also appear in the Hall and Seebeck coefficient confirm the occurence of what is probably some type of phase transition. However, x-ray diffraction studies show no structural transition to within the accuracy of the measurements, 0.0025 A.22,23 Resistance anomalies have been observed in the HTB In_x_WO3,10 and in cubic Li_x_WO3,24 but no mechanism for the anomalies has been suggested. In the _d_-band metals, resistive anomalies associated with phase transitions commonly occur, in particular with martensitic transitions. Very small structural phase transitions with temperature have recently been observed in cubic Na_x_WO3 but these transitions do not produce observable changes in the electrical properties.30

Recent theory has indicated that _d_-band metals with relatively large density of states at the Fermi surface possess a tendency toward collective electron instability which is characterized by a periodic charge redistribution.31 These charge fluctuations are strongly coupled to the lattice and create anomalies in the phonon spectra, structural transitions, or possibly a charge-density wave (CDW). The former two of these possibilities have both been observed to occur in the cubic tungsten bronze, Na_x_WO3,32,33 In Rb_x_WO3 the possibility of a lattice distortion which is too small to be detected in the x-ray diffraction measurements which have been made to date cannot be ruled out. Neither can the possibility of the formation of a CDW be ruled out. The anomaly in the temperature dependence of the resistivity would certainly be explained if such a transition occurs. Also the energy gaps which open up with CDW formation could result in a Hall coefficient which rises with decreasing temperature below the transition as is observed for Rb_x_WO3 as shown in Fig. 6. The cubic phase shows no such variation in \(R_{H}\) which remains constant from 1 to 300 K.11

However, it is difficult to see how to explain the concentration dependence of the transition shown in Fig. 5 within this model. If vacancies in the Rb lattice act as scattering centers as the resistivity data seems to indicate, then it would be reasonable to assume that they would also tend to drive the phase-transition temperature down since impurities are in general destructive to CDW formation. As Fig. 5 shows, this is not the case. The transition temperature increases with decreasing concentration to a sharp maximum at \(x\) = 0.25 and then decreases. It is interesting to speculate that there is a form of ordering of the Rb atoms near \(x\) = 0.25 which could be commensurate with a possible CDW and thus assists the formation of the CDW. While there is no evidence for ordering in Rb_x_WO3 (the line intensity would be expected to be only about 1% of the strong W lines and thus too weak to be observed in the x-ray diffraction experiments); evidence of ordering has been observed in cubic Na_x_WO3 near \(x\) = 0.75.34

Other than the peak observed in the transition temperature \(T_{B}\) at \(x\) = 0.25, no other changes in the electrical properties were seen as \(x\) is lowered through \(x\) = 0.25. This would seem to indicate no major changes in the Fermi-surface geometry. Measurement of the room-temperature Seebeck coefficient, \(S\), support this contention. As mentioned before, simple free-electron theory predicts that \(S\) _a_ = _n_-2/3 where \(n\) is the number of conduction electrons. Figure 7 shows that the room-temperature Seebeck coefficient increases as _x_-2/3 indicating a consistent depopulation of the conduction band as the Rb concentration is decreased.

While the absolute values of \(S\) are similar to those of other tungsten bronzes the variation of \(S\) with temperature is difficult to explain. The reason for the almost temperature-independent behavior of \(S\) above \(T_{B}\) is not clear since in the free-electron model \(S\) _a_ \(T\) and this is observed for \(x\) = 0.33. Hopping models of electrical conductivity have been used to  explain Seebeck coefficients which are temperature independent at high temperature in pseudo-one-dimensional systems,[35] but there is no evidence for the localization of electrons in Rb2WO3 which this model would require. For \(x\) = 0.33 an effective mass can be calculated in the almost free-electron picture since

\[S = \frac{2}{3}\left( \frac{1}{3}\pi \right)^{2/3}\left( \alpha k_{B}2/e\,\hbar^{2} \right)Tn^{-2/3}\;\;,\]

where \(\alpha = m^{\star}/m_{0}\). Taking one electron per Rb ion or \(n\) = \(x\), we get \(\alpha = 2.75\) which is very close to the calorimetrically determined value of King _et al._[8].

Concentration-dependent phase transitions have been observed in cubic tungsten bronzes. At \(x\) = 0.25 Li2WO3 undergoes a metal-insulator transition,[24] while Na2WO3 shows several structural transitions with concentration with all phases being metallic.[30] However, no transitions have previously been observed in HTB.

The effect of the phase transition at \(x\) = 0.25 can also be seen in the superconducting transition temperature which shows a pronounced minimum for a Rb concentration near \(x\) = 0.25 as seen in Fig. 8. Above this critical concentration the measured _T_c's show varied behavior as has been previously described making it very difficult to speculate on the factors affecting _T_c.

In the cubic Na2WO3 system, the superconducting transition temperature increases almost exponentially from about 0.75 K at \(x\) = 0.40 to about 3 K at \(x\) = 0.20[33] as the concentration approaches the phase transition from tetragonal I to tetragonal II which occurs at \(x\) = 0.2. Several theories have attempted to explain this increase based primarily on a decrease in lattice stability which results in a softening of the phonon modes and an enhanced electron-phonon interaction and thus an increase in _T_c.[36] As the phase boundary is approached the increasing instability in the lattice results in high _T_c's up to some maximum where the distortion of either the lattice or electron coordinates stabilizes the low-concentration phase with a consequent drastic reduction in _T_c. The high _T_c's observed for \(x\) >= 0.26 could result from a similar mechanism, although the nature of the phase below \(x\) = 0.26 which would bring on a lattice softening is not clear.

However, the high _T_c's did not prove to be very reproducible and could result from some type of surface effect in our crystals. It may well be that the _T_c's of the bulk material show first an increase down to near \(x\) = 0.28 and then a decrease below this concentration similar to the data of Wanless and Sienko.[15] In spite of this uncertainty the one thing that is clear is that around \(x\) = 0.25 some type of transition in behavior is occurring.

The increase in _T_c at 5 K at \(x\) = 0.16 as the concentration is decreased below \(x\) = 0.25 also remains unexplained. One could invoke the argument above that another phase of instability is being approached at low concentration, which as we have mentioned is true; however, it is certainly not clear why _T_c should increase so rapidly below \(x\) = 0.25 or in fact why this particular phase should be superconducting at all. Examination of the data would seem to indicate that around \(x\) = 0.25 there exists a particular phase or "pseudophase" which is not conducive to superconductivity. The nature of this pseudophase and whether it could be tied to some ordering of the Rb ion is unknown. It is interesting to note that in the HTB, Cs2WO3, with its larger and heavier Cs ions, no such anomaly in _T_c is observed[37]; however, for the lighter K ions there is some preliminary evidence of a similar anomaly.[38] The model of the superconducting state based on the Einstein modes associated with the motion of the alkali ions in the WO3 lattice, which seemed to possibly explain the variations in _T_c with different alkali ions in the HTB for \(x\) = 0.33,[17] fails completely to explain the variations in _T_c for \(x\) < 0.33 since it predicts a decreasing _T_c with decreasing \(x\) below \(x\) = 0.33.

Another property of the superconducting state in Rb2WO3 is the large hexagonal anisotropy in _H_c2 about the \(c\) axis. This anisotropy exists throughout the concentration range 0.18 <= \(x\) <= 0.33, increasing in value as \(x\) decreases. In addition there is also a twofold anisotropy in _H_c2 in the plane of \(c\) axis. In this plane one could certainly use some type of effective-mass model,[39] as has been done extensively in the layer-structure materials, to describe the behavior to at least some approximation, but such a model predicts isotropic behavior in the hexagonal plane, completely contrary to the data. One is then forced to look at a more detailed model based on an anisotropy of the Fermi surface, phonon spectrum, or electron-phonon coupling, or some combination of these. Several such theories exist,[40] but in all cases they predict an anisotropy which is small and temperature dependent. This however is not the case for the Rb2WO3 system and further theoretical work on anisotropic superconductors will be necessary to explain these experimental results.

The magnitude of _H_c2 as a function of Rb concentration and temperature also shows interesting properties. As Table I shows, the critical fields of Rb2WO3 are very low when compared to the values of _H_c2 observed at lower concentrations. These low values are in essential agreement with the value quoted by Bevolo,[17] who concluded, based on the low value of _H_c2 and heat-capacity data, that the stoichiometric compound was in fact a type-I superconductor. It is interesting that the decreasing Rb concentration decreases the critical field so dramatically and that the hexagonal anisotropy in the critical field at \(x\) = 0.33 is large (_A_ = 0.15) even though the fields are small.

  Our attempts to fit the temperature dependence of the critical-field data to the Maki theory for dirty type-II superconductor [27] in many cases have displayed significant disagreement at low temperatures due mainly to the positive-upward curvature near \(t\) = 0 in low-_x_ samples. Such positive curvature has been observed in other highly anisotropy materials, such as the layer-structured materials.[41] A recent theory[42] using an effective two-band model has attempted to explain similar behavior of _H_e2 in the compound C801WO20F01,[16] which has a similar structure to RbxWO3 and a reasonable fit to the positive curvature in _H_e2 versus temperature data was obtained. Assuming no electron-phonon coupling between the bands and no interband scattering by impurities, the _H_e2 vs \(T\) curves can be constructed from a mixture of contributions from the bands. Because of the similarity in structure of the compounds, this theory should apply to the RbxWO3 systems; however the details are certainly not clear.

## 5 Conclusions

At room temperature and below all the current data on Rb033WO3 is consistent with a conduction mechanism which consists predominantly of electron scattering from the Einstein-like modes associated with the Rb ions. For concentrations below 0.33, however, temperature-dependent anomalies in the electrical transport properties occur which strongly suggest some type of temperature-dependent phase transition. While the exact nature of this transition could not be determined, the lack of an observable change in the crystal structure as a function of temperature, coupled with large changes in the electrical properties with temperature seems to indicate something more than a simple crystal structure transformation. Furthermore, the concentration dependence of this phase transition exhibits a sharp maximum in the phase-transition temperature _T_B, near \(x\) = 0.25. This maximum in _T_B coupled with an anomalous drop in _T_c near \(x\) = 0.25 seems to indicate a phase transformation at a composition near \(x\) = 0.25, the nature of which is currently indeterminant. The difference between the concentration dependence above and below \(x\) = 0.25 of the temperature _T_B at which the resistive anomaly occurs indicates a correlation between the composition and the temperature-dependent phase transitions.

The superconducting state in RbxWO3 shows a large temperature-independent 60 deg anisotropy in _H_e2 in the plane perpendicular to the \(c\) axis which appears to not be explainable in the context of current theories of anisotropic superconductors. The temperature dependence of _H_e2 shows a positive curvature near _T_c which has been previously observed in many highly anisotropic materials.

RbxWO3, and in general the hexagonal _M_xWO3 compounds, appear to be excellent systems for the study of the complex interplay among temperature-dependence phase transitions, composition-dependent phase transitions, and superconductivity. Further experimental and theoretical work is essential to understand the behavior of these systems.
