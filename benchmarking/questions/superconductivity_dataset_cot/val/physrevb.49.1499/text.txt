Rare-earth magnetism in high-_T_c_ cuprate systems has been the subject of extensive research in recent years. Apart from anomalous Pr ordering in PrBa2Cu3O7-, (Ref. 1) and TlBa2PrCu2O7-, (Ref. 2) with many puzzling characteristics, Gd received the earliest attention through its antiferromagnetic ordering in both superconducting GdBa2Cu3O7 (1:2:3:7) and nonsuperconducting GdBa2Cu3O6 (1:2:3:6).3,4 Somewhat unexpected, they exhibit identical Neel temperatures \(T_{N}\) near 2.2 K. In contrast, \(T_{N}\) is sensitive to the oxygen content in other isostructural _R_Ba2Cu3O7-, \(R\) compounds with \(R\) being, e.g., Pr or Nd.5 The whole issue is yet to be fully resolved, and experiments on more diversified high-_T_c_ cuprate systems are in order. This work is indeed carried out for such purposes. It extends our earlier study on tetragonal TlBa2GdCu7- \(T\) Tl(1:2:1:2) (Ref. 6) to three new Gd-containing compounds, all with Sr substituting for Ba. In these three compounds, TlSr2GdCu2O7- and (Pb0,5Cu0,5)Sr2GdCu2O7-  are isostructural to TlBa2GdCu2O7-, while Pb2Sr2GdCu3O8+,  Pb(2:2:1:3) as an orthorhombic compound.7 Of particular interest is the correlation of their Neel temperatures with the Gd-Gd distance. To supplement magnetic data, calorimetric measurements allow magnetic entropy determination. Gd3+ has zero orbital angular momentum \(L\) and, therefore, experiences no crystal-field effect. The total angular momentum \(J\) is equal to the total spin \(S\) = \(\frac{1}{2}\). Consequently, the 2\(J\) + 1 ground-state multiplet remains fully degenerate in the absence of magnetic ordering, and a magnetic entropy of \(R\) ln 8 is expected to be associated with the ordering process. Sample preparation method and experimental details were described elsewhere.6

The x-ray powder diffraction pattern of the TlSr2GdCu2O7- (d < 0.2) sample indicates a single-phase Tl(1212) or TlBa2CaCu2O7-, -type structure2 with tetragonal lattice parameters \(a\) = 3.831(2) A and \(c\) = 12.040(5) A. This structure with space group _P4/mmm_ is very much similar to that of the tetragonal GdBa2Cu3O6 (space group _P4/mmm_) or orthorhombic GdBa2Cu3O7 (space group _P/mmm_). In fact, its only difference from GdBa2Cu3O7 is the replacement of the Cu-O chains by a Tl-O plane with oxygen located at the center. An oxygen deficiency parameter \(d\) < 0.2 is estimated based on the Rietveld refinement result of the isostructural compound TlSr2PrCu2O7-, 8 A slight deficiency of Tl( < 5%) is also estimated and is due to the sample preparation process.8

The temperature dependence of specific heat \(C\) of TlSr2GdCu2O7-, \(R\) is shown in Fig. 1, along with the earlier data for the isostructural and nonmagnetic TlBa2YCu2O7- (Ref. 2) to simulate the lattice contribution _Ci_ = _bT_\({}^{\text{3}}\)=0.00167\({}^{\text{3}}\) corresponding to a Debye temperature _th_ of 250 K. A well-defined Gd ordering peak prevails just below 2.4 K, in agreement with the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility _kh_ data with \(T_{N}\) (Gd) = 2.4+-0.1 K in the inset. High-temperature magnetic susceptibility data indicate an antiferromagnetic ordering of Cu2+ moments above room temperature. A Curie-Weiss behavior _kh_ = _C_*/(_T_ - _th_p_) was observed at low temperature in the 1 T field, where the strong applied magnetic field effectively decouples the weak exchange coupling between the disordered Gd3+ and ordered Cu2+ moments. The Curie constant _C_* = _N_m_\({}_{\text{eff}}^{\text{2}}\)/3\(k\) corresponds to an effective magnetic moment _m_eff=7.7_m_B_, a  value close to 7.94_m__B_ for the free Gd3+ ion (_J_ = \(S\) = \(\frac{\tau}{2}\)), if the small contribution from Cu2+ moments are neglected. The paramagnetic Curie-Weiss intercept at _th__p_ = \(-\)3.2 K is close to \(T_{N}\), except for the sign, in agreement with antiferromagnetic interactions. The difference between this \(T_{N}\)(Gd) and the equivalent value of 2.3 +- 0.1 K for isostructural TlBa2GdCu2O7-_b_ (Ref. [6] will be discussed later.

Figure 2 presents the specific-heat data in a different format of \(C_{m}\) /_T_ versus \(T_{N}\), where \(C_{m}\) = \(C\) - \(C\)1. Integration over the area below the data point and the dashed-line extrapolation yields the magnetic entropy \(S_{m}\)(_T_) = \(\int_{0}^{\infty}(C_m/T)dT\). The expected total magnetic entropy \(R\) ln8 is being approached not far above \(T_{N}\) as shown in the inset. It implies that the broad shoulder-type extrapolation below 2 K has certain validity. Indeed, this can be well justified because similar features have been observed in several other Gd-containing high-_T__c_ cuprates.[6]

For isostructural Pb(1212) compound (Pb0,5Cu0.5)Sr2GdCu2O7-_b_ (_d_ < 0.2), powder x-ray-diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of a single-phase Pb(1212) with \(a\) = 3.839(2) A and \(c\) = 11.838(5) A. The Tl (1_a_) sites of space group \(P\)4/_mmm_ are now occupied by equal numbers of Pb and Cu. Calorimetric and magnetic data in Fig. 3 resemble those in Fig. 1 for TlSr2GdCu2O7-_b_ and an antiferromagnetic ordering prevails at 2.3 K. Magnetic susceptibility above \(T_{N}\) shows a Curie-Weiss behavior, with an effective magnetic moment _m_eff=7.8_m__B_ and a paramagnetic intercept of _th__p_ = \(-\)2.4 K. Following the further analysis in Fig. 4 by assuming the same lattice contribution \(C\)1 = 0.0016\(T\)3 in calculating magnetic specific heat \(C_{m}\) = \(C\) - \(C\)1 and a low-temperature Schottky-type specific-heat anomaly, a total magnetic entropy \(S_{m}\) ~ \(R\) ln8 is derived. It supports unequivocally that the observed transition is indeed associated with the Gd3+ ions, further confirming that the Tl-O or (Pb,Cu)-O planes do not participate significantly toward the ordering process.

A parallel study was performed on the vacuum annealed compound Pb5Sr2GdCu3O8+ (_y_  0). Powder x-ray diffraction data indicate a single-phase orthorhombic Pb(2213) or Pb2Sr2YCu3O8+-type structure (0 <= \(y\) <= 1), [7] with lattice parameters \(a\) = 5.411(3) A, \(b\) = 5.448(3) A, and \(c\) = 15.742(5) A. The main difference between Pb2Sr2GdCu3O8 and TlSr2GdCu2O7 is the replacement of the Tl-O plane by the PbO-Cu-PbO planes. Magnetic and calorimetric data for this sample are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. A small lattice specific heat \(C\)1 of 0.0019\(T\)3 is calculated based on the assumption of the same Debye temperature _th__D_ of 250 K. Again, a \(T_{N}\) of 2.3 K is obtained. Magnetic susceptibility above \(T_{N}\) shows a Curie-Weiss behavior, with an effective magnetic moment _m_eff=7.8_m__B_ and a Curie-Weiss intercept of _th__p_ = \(-\)3.6 K. A total magnetic entropy \(S_{m}\) ~ \(R\) ln8 is derived.

Having shown that \(T_{N}\)(Gd) for the three compounds studied here remains practically the same at 2.3-2.4 K, it can be stated that there is no significant difference in their overall magnetic interaction strength among Gd moments. In fact, the Gd sublattice is relatively simple, with the Gd-Gd nearest-neighbor in the _ab_ basal plane. The nearest-neighbor distance \(r\)1 is equal to \(a\) of 3.83-3.84 A for TlSr2GdCu2O7-_b_.

\[r_{1} = (a^{2} + b^{2})^{1/2} = 3.85\text{\AA}\]

for Pb2Sr2GdCu3O8+. The shortest Gd-Gd distance along the _c_-axis \(d_{c}\) is extremely long. For TlSr2GdCu2O7-8 and (Pb0.5Cu0.5)Sr2GdCu2O7-8, \(d_{c}\) = 11.8-12.0 A and is the seventh nearest-neighbor distance \(r\)7. For Pb2Sr2GdCu3O8+, \(d_{c}\) = 15.7 A is the ninth nearest-neighbor distance \(r\)9. Table 1 summarizes the Gd antiferromagnetic ordering temperature \(T_{N}\)(Gd) values for various Gd cuprates together with the tetragonal/orthorhombic lattice parameters, Gd-Gd nearest-neighbor distance (_r_1) and the shortest Gd-Gd distance along the \(c\) axis (\(d_{c}\)), in the single CuO2 layer compound Gd2CuO4 and (Gd1.85Ce0.15)CuO4.9 The nearest-neighbor distance is pointed along the \(c\) axis with \(r\)1 = \(d_{c}\) = 3.552-3.570 A, where Gd3+ ions occupy the (4_e_)(0,0,\(z\) = 0.35) sites in space group \(I\)4/_mmm_. All other compounds with the double-CuO2 layers have the nearest-neighbor distance in the basal plane \(r\)1 = 3.83-3.89 A and a very long Gd-Gd distance along or near the \(c\) axis. The comparison further suggests that the overall magnetic interaction is highly anisotropic and the interaction strength in the \(c\) direction is much weaker than that in the basal plane. Still, the magnetic order is 3D in nature, as verified by neutron-diffraction experiments in GdBa2Cu3O7 and GdBa2Cu3O6.10,11 Realizing that the three compounds reported here, as well as TlBa2GdCu2O7-8,6 are practically semiconductors, magnetic dipole-dipole interaction is probably the major mechanism responsible for the magnetic ordering process. If the Gd magnetic structure is similar to that of GdBa2Cu3O7,10 then the dipole-dipole interaction energy among Gd3+ moments in the basal plane up to sixth nearest neighbors can be estimated using the formula

\[U_{d - d} = 4\mu^{2}(1/r_{1}^{3} - 1/r_{2}^{3} - 1/r_{3}^{3} + 2/r_{4}^{3} + 1/r_{5}^{3} + 1/r_{6}^{3}) = 0.24\text{ meV}\text{,}\]

where _m_(Gd) = 7.9_m__b_, \(r\)1 = 3.84 A, \(r\)2 = \(r\)2_r_1, \(r\)3 = 2\(r\)1, \(r\)4 = \(g\)5_r_1, \(r\)5 = \(g\)8_r_1, and \(r\)6 = 3\(r\)1 = 11.52 A. This value is still lower than the estimated exchanged energy

\[U_{\text{ex}} \cong 2J\cdot S^{2} = 0.47 - 0.72\text{ MeV}\text{,}\]

where the average exchange interaction parameter J is deduced from the Curie-Weiss paramagnetic intercept _th__p_. Other coupling mechanisms (superexchange and/or RKKY coupling) must therefore play a complementary role. Although the major mechanism appears to be the dipole-dipole interaction, its intrinsic anisotropy does not seem to play any role here. The effective 2D character of this coupling simply arises from the long Gd-Gd distance along the \(c\) axis compared to that within the basal plane. The existence of other coupling mechanisms is revealed by (i) the 3D nature of the Gd magnetic ordering,10,11 and (ii) by the enhancement of \(T_{N}\)(Gd) in Gd2CuO4 and (Gd1.85Ce0.15)CuO4,9 which cannot be explained by the dipole-dipole interaction alone. The second coupling mechanism is probably very anisotropic, as suggested by the different \(T_{N}\)(Gd) values in Gd2CuO4 and related compounds.

The broad shoulder-type extrapolation below 2 K has certain validity because similar features have been observed in several other Gd-containing high-_T__c_ cuprates.6 Such a seemingly common behavior has been contemplated with several theoretical interpretations including, e.g., a 2D-3D ordering or a commensurate-incommensurate transition in magnetic order. However, neutron-diffraction data have shown that Gd ordering is a 3D

  commensurate antiferromagnetic transition, it is unlikely that the commensurate to incommensurate transition can occur below the transition temperature. On the other hand, a 2D ordering should occur at higher temperature than a 3D ordering but not below it. It should be noted that similar broad peaks below magnetic transition temperature \(T_{m}\) were observed previously in ferromagnetic Gd metal and metallic GdCu\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\) (\(T_{N}\) = 11.9 K).[13, 14] Fishman and Liu proposed that the broad peak below \(T_{m}\) may be caused by the quantum spin fluctuations induced by a transverse degree of freedom[13]; the peak becomes more pronounced as the total spin \(S\) increases and occurs at temperature \(T^{\bullet}\) \(\simeq\) 3\(T_{m}\) /(\(S\) + 1). For Gd\({}^{3+}\) having the highest \(S\) value of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) among all rare-earth ions, \(T^{\bullet}\) \(\simeq\) 0.67\(T_{N}\) = 1.5 K is estimated and is in reasonable agreement with our experimental observations. However, Fishman and Liu did not contribute the bump in the Gd metal to this quantum fluctuation, but to a normal mean-field mechanism.[13] Regardless of all these discrepancies that may be caused by different types of magnetic coupling, the main conclusion remains valid, namely, taking this Schottky-like bump into account is fundamental in the calculation of the magnetic entropy.

Several conclusions can thus be made.

(1) Antiferromagnetic ordering among Gd\({}^{3+}\) ions is found to have a rather narrow Neel temperature range of 2.2\(-\)2.4 K in high-\(T_{c}\) Gd cuprates systems with double-CuO\({}_{2}\) layer structures. For single-CuO\({}_{2}\)-layer compound Gd\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\), a higher \(T_{N}\) value was observed.

(2) Dipole-dipole interaction is mainly responsible for the ordering process, with other anisotropic coupling mechanisms (superexchange and/or **RKKY**) playing a complementary role.

(3) A Schottky-like anomaly in specific heat below the cooperative-type peak at \(T_{N}\) is a common feature for these Gd-containing compounds. It needs to be taken into account to derive the expected entropy \(R\ln(2J+1)\) = \(R\ln\)8 associated with the ordering process.
