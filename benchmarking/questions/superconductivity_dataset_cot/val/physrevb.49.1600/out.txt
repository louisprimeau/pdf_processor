## I Introduction

About three decades ago, Kadanoff and Baym [1] established a formula relating the thermodynamic average of a model Hamiltonian for an interacting Bose system in the normal phase to a spectral-weight function. This function can either be defined [1] in terms of the retarded and the advanced single-particle Green's functions or can be given [2] by a discontinuity across the real axis of a certain function [2] constructed by analytic continuation of the Fourier coefficient corresponding to the temperature Green's function of the system to nonreal z ( = _i_o__m_, where o_{m} is a Matsubara frequency). A few years ago, relations between spectral-weight functions and the Fourier transforms in space and time of the dynamic correlation functions of order parameter fluctuations were established by the present author for the effective Bose system [3] and also for the singlet-spin-pairing and equal-spin-pairing states of a Fermi fluid [4] with weakly attractive interaction. The present work aims at establishing a relation between the thermodynamic potential per unit volume corresponding to mixed singlet-triplet states [5] of this Fermi system and certain other spectral-weight functions. We also aim at establishing the same for an assembly of spinless, interacting bosons in the ordered phase. The former gives the relations for pure singlet and triplet states as special cases whereas, in suitable limits, the latter reduces to the Kadanoff-Baym (KB) relation [1] for the normal phase. The idea behind establishing these relations is to show the possibility of the derivation of finite-temperature thermodynamics and critical behavior of these two systems using the weight-function method.

An outline of the content of this paper is as follows. A relation between the thermodynamic potential per unit volume, in mixed singlet-triplet states [5] of a Fermi fluid and certain spectral-weight functions is established in Sec. II. A set of coupled equations for various gap functions occurring in this relation are also set up. The KB relation for the normal phase of an interacting Bose system is extended to the ordered phase in Sec. III using the well-known Bogolubov prescription [6]. The usefulness of the relation to derive thermodynamics and critical behavior is demonstrated using an approximate form of the Matsubara propagators in the finite-temperature analogues [2, 7] of the Beliaev equations. It is shown that crossover scaling forms for the susceptibility and the deviation of pressure from its critical value, calculated using the present method, are in general agreement with the corresponding ones obtained by previous workers [8, 9] by their renormalization-group (RG) approaches to the problem. Finally, Sec. IV contains a discussion related to the work presented in this paper.

## II Thermodynamic potential of a Fermi system

The system under consideration is an assembly of interacting fermions contained in a box of volume V. In second quantized notation, the mean-field Hamiltonian [10] of the assembly, in the case of mixed singlet-triplet pairing, reads (in units such that \bar{\pi} = 1)

\[H_{F} = \sum\limits_{k}\,A_{k}^{\dagger}\epsilon_{k}\,A_{k}\,\,,\]

\[A_{k} = \left\{\begin{array}{l} a_{k\uparrow}\\ a_{k\downarrow}\\ a_{-k\uparrow}^{+}\\ a^{-}_{-k\downarrow}\end{array}\right\}\,,\]

\[\begin{array}{l} {\epsilon_{k} = \frac{1}{2}\left[\begin{array}{l} {\epsilon_{F}(k)}0\,  Here, m_{F} and m_{F}, respectively, denote the mass and chemical potential of a fermion. _V__kk_' denotes an attractive interaction potential. The subscripts 1 and 2 in (3), respectively, correspond to the two spin states 1 and 1 and angular brackets < > to the thermodynamic average calculated with H_{F}. Fermi statistics implies [5,11] that in this case, whereas (D11,D22) are odd functions of k, (D12,D21) are neither even nor odd. Equations for these gap functions will be written down towards the end of this section.

Our aim here is to establish a relation between the thermodynamic potential per unit volume

\[\Omega_{F} = - (\beta V)^{- 1} \ln {\rm Tr}\exp( - \beta H_{F})\]

of the assembly and certain spectral weight functions. Here, b denotes the inverse of the product of temperature T and Boltzmann constant k_{B}. The specific heat at constant volume will be calculated using this relation also to demonstrate its usefulness.

It is convenient to define a new potential per unit volume O_{F}(_l_) in terms of the Hamiltonian H_{F}(_l_) = _l__H__F_, where l is a variable, for the purpose stated above. One can write

\[\Omega_{F}(\lambda) = V^{- 1} \int \frac{d\lambda}{\lambda}\left( {H_{F}(\lambda)} \right)_{\lambda} + \Omega_{0F}\ ,\]

where the angular brackets < >l_A denote thermodynamic average calculated with H_{F}(_l_) and O_{F} is an integration constant to be specified later [see note below Eq. (28)]. The system under consideration corresponds to O_F_(_l_ = 1). Obviously, the task now boils down to establishing relations between the average < H_{F}(_l_)>l and spectral-weight functions.

We follow the methodology pioneered by Kadanoff and Baym,[1] by and large, to accomplish the task. The first step is to set up equations of motion for the operators _a__k__o_(_t_), _a__k__o_(_t_) (_s_ = 1, _i_), etc., where

\[a_{k\sigma}(t) = e^{iH_{F}(\lambda)t}a_{k\sigma}e^{-iH_{F}(\lambda)t}\ .\]

The next step is to write down equations of motion for the averages \sum_{k}\left\langle {a^{\dagger}_{k\sigma}(t^{\prime})a_{k\sigma^{\prime}}(t^{\prime})} \right\rangle_{\lambda}. These equations yield

\[\left\langle {H_{F}(\lambda)} \right\rangle_{\lambda} = \frac{1}{4}\lim\limits_{t^{\prime}\to t}\sum_{k\sigma} \left[ {i\frac{\partial}{\partial t} - i\frac{\partial}{\partial t^{\prime}}} \right]\] \[\times \left\{ \left\langle {a^{\dagger}_{k\sigma}(t^{\prime})a  \[\xi(k) = \{(\,|\Delta_{11}|^{2} - |\Delta_{22}|^{2})^{2} + (\,|\Delta_{12}|^{2} - |\Delta_{21}^{2}|^{2})^{2} + 2(\Delta_{11}^{\dagger}\Delta_{12}^{\dagger} - \Delta_{12}^{\dagger}\Delta_{12})^{2} \}\]

and the coefficients D_{i}(k) are obtained replacing (\,-\,1\,)^{i}\,-\,1\, with (\,-\,1\,)^{i} in (16). In view of (15)-(20), it may be remarked that the introduction of mixed singlet-triplet pairing, within the BCS approximation scheme, has merely complicated the notation without much qualitative change in expressions of quantities, such as that for excitation energy E_{k}. In fact, as is expected, we have an expression for E_{k} which gives both the spin singlet (\Delta_{ij}=0 = \Delta_{21}^{\dagger}) and the spin triplet (\Delta_{21}^{\dagger}=0) excitation energies as special cases.

The gap functions (GF) occurring in the sum in (14) are not yet known. These functions can be expressed in terms of appropriate temperature Green's functions. As in the case of A_{F}(\pm k\sigma,\omega), GF's can then be obtained solving equations for Fourier coefficients corresponding to these temperature functions. Without showing any of the details, we write down here the self-consistent equations for GF's obtained by the above procedure:

\[\Delta_{ij}(k) = \sum_{k^{\prime}}V_{kk^{\prime}}\left[\,A_{ij}(k^{\prime})\tanh \frac{\beta E_{k^{\prime}}^{(1)}}{2} \right.\] (21) \[\left.\qquad\qquad\qquad+B_{ij}(k^{\prime})\tanh\frac{\beta E_{k^{ \prime 2}}^{(2)}}{2}\,\right]\,,\]

where i,j=1,2 and

\[A_{ij}(k) = -\frac{|G_{ij}^{(1)}(k)|}{2E_{k}^{(1)}(E_{k}^{(1)2} - E_{k}^{(2)2})}\,\,,\] \[B_{ij}(k) = \frac{|G_{ij}^{(2)}(k)|}{2E_{k}^{(2)}(E_{k}^{(1)2} - E_{k}^{(2)2})}\,\,,\] \[G_{ii}^{(1)}(k) = \begin{bmatrix}\Delta_{ii}(k)&\Delta_{jj}^{\dagger}(k)\\ \xi^{2}(k)&\eta_{1}^{2}(k)\end{bmatrix}\,,\,  singlet states, it reduces to the simple expression

\[\Omega_{FS} = - 2(\beta V)^{-1}\sum_{k}\ln\left\{1 + e^{-\beta E_{k}} \right\},\;\;\;E_{k} = (\epsilon_{F}^{2} + \Delta^{2})^{1/2}\;.\]

The entropy per unit volume, in view of the note below (28), is given by

\[C_{V} = \frac{- k_{B}\beta^{2}}{2V}\sum_{j = 1,2}\sum_{k}\;\left[ 2\frac{\partial E_{k}^{(j)}}{\partial\beta} + \beta\frac{\partial^{2}E_{k}^{(j)}}{\partial\beta^{2}} \right]e^{-\beta E_{k}^{(j)}/2}{\rm sech}\frac{\beta E_{k}^{(j)}}{2} + \frac{k_{B}\beta^{2}}{4V}\sum_{j = 1,2}\sum_{k}\;\left[ E_{k}^{(j)} + \beta\frac{\partial E_{k}^{(j)}}{\partial\beta} \right]^{2}{\rm sech}^{2}\frac{\beta E_{k}^{(j)}}{2}\;.\]

In the case of a BCS superconductor, (30) assumes the simple form

\[S_{FS} = - \frac{k_{B}\beta}{V}\sum_{k}\;\left[ E_{k} + \beta\frac{\partial E_{k}}{\partial\beta} \right]\;\left[ \tanh\frac{\beta E_{k}}{2} - 1\;\right]\] (32) \[+ \frac{k_{B}}{V}\sum_{k}2\ln\left\{1 + e^{-\beta E_{k}} \right\}\;.\]

The term

\[\left[ - k_{B}\beta V^{-1}\sum_{k}\beta(\partial E_{k}/\partial\beta)(\tanh\beta E _{k}/2 - 1)\;\right]\]

in (32) is a typical consequence of Fermi statistics, for Leggett's expression [5] for S_{FS}, calculated using Planck's formula and the ansatz that the probability of occurrence of ground pair, broken pair, and excited pair states are given by the Boltzmann distribution, does not contain this term. Near the critical temperature of the superconductor, this term may be assumed to be small compared to the other terms in (32) as the gap \Delta may be approximated by a constant at criticality. This emphasizes that the statistics does not play a significant role [4] in determining critical behavior of thermodynamic functions.

Other useful relations also exist for calculating thermodynamic potential of a Fermi system, e.g., the relation [14] for pure singlet states involving pair susceptibility. Sofo and Balseiro [15] used this relation to derive the thermodynamics of a two-dimensional electron gas in the low-density limit. However, as remarked by these authors, the correct way of doing the calculation is through the approach of Kadanoff and Baym. [1]\qquad\  venient to define a new thermodynamic potential per unit volume \Omega_{B}(\lambda) in terms of the Hamiltonian H^{\prime}_{B}(M,\lambda)\!=\!\lambda H^{\prime}_{B}(M). The potential \Omega_{B}(\lambda) will be then given by a relation similar to (5). Thus, as in the preceding section, the aim boils down to obtaining (H^{\prime}_{B}(M,\lambda))_{\lambda} in terms of weight functions.

To achieve this goal, we first set up equations of motion for the operators b_{q}(t), b^{\dagger}_{q}(t), etc., where

\[b_{q}(t)\!=\!e^{iH^{\prime}_{B}(M,\lambda)t}b_{q}e^{-iH^{\prime}_{B}(M,\lambda)t}\;.\] (38)

Next, we manipulate these equations to obtain

\[\!  \[\frac{h}{2M}=-\mu_{B}+\Sigma_{11}^{\bullet}(0,0)-\Sigma_{02}^{\bullet}(0,0)\ .\] (50)

Equation (50) is the equation to determine M. This corresponds to the finite temperature analogue [16, 17, 17] of the Hugenholtz-Pines theorem. The thermodynamic potential per unit volume, on the other hand, is given by

\[\Omega_{B}(\lambda=1)= \Omega_{0B}-hM+E_{0}(M)\] \[-\frac{1}{2V}\sum_{q}\left[\frac{q^{2}}{2m_{B}}+\frac{h}{2M}\ \right]\] \[+(\beta V)^{-1}\sum_{q}\ln\sinh\frac{\beta\epsilon_{q}}{2}\ .\] (51)

In the ordered phase, the equation to determine M and the thermodynamic potential per unit volume are obtained by taking the limits h\to 0 and h/M\to 0 (M\neq 0) in (50) and (51), respectively. The self-energies, in the approximation scheme of Ref. [16], are given by

\[\Sigma_{11}^{\bullet}(0,0)= \,2U(M)+4un^{\ast}(T,\Sigma_{11}^{\bullet},\Sigma_{02}^{\bullet})+ 2uy(T,\Sigma_{11}^{\bullet},\Sigma_{02}^{\bullet})\ ,\] (52) \[\Sigma_{02}^{\bullet}(0,0)=U(M)+2uy(T,\Sigma_{11}^{\bullet},\Sigma _{02}^{\bullet})\ ,\]

where

\[n^{\ast}= V^{-1}\sum_{q}\left(\,b_{q}^{\dagger}b_{q}\,\right)\] \[= \frac{1}{V}\sum_{q}\left[\begin{array}{c}\epsilon_{B}(q)+\Sigma _{11}^{\bullet}(0,0)\\ \epsilon_{q0}(\exp\beta\epsilon_{q0}-1)\end{array}\right.\] \[\qquad\qquad+\frac{\epsilon_{B}(q)+\Sigma_{11}^{\bullet}(0,0)- \epsilon_{q0}}{2\epsilon_{q0}}\ \right]\ ,\] (53) \[y= V^{-1}\sum_{q}\left\langle\,b_{q}\,b_{-q}\,\right\rangle\] \[= -\frac{1}{V}\sum_{q}\Sigma_{02}^{\bullet}(0,0)\left[\frac{1}{2 \epsilon_{q0}}+\frac{1}{\epsilon_{q0}(\exp\beta\epsilon_{q0}-1)}\ \right]\ ,\] (54) \[\epsilon_{q0}^{2}=\left[\frac{q^{2}}{2m_{B}}\ \right]\left[\frac{q^{2}}{2m_{B}}+2\Sigma_{02}^{\bullet}(0,0)\ \right]\ .\] (55)

The term E_{0}(M) is given by \left[\,-\mu_{B}M^{2}+uM^{4}-2un^{\ast 2}-up^{\ast 2}\right]. Equations (52)-(54) are the self-consistent equations for \Sigma_{11}^{\bullet}, \Sigma_{02}^{\bullet}, n^{\prime}, and y. Starting with Eqs. (51)-(55) the entire thermodynamics of a Bose system in the ordered phase can be derived. We now obtain crossover scaling forms [9, 9] for the susceptibility and the deviation of pressure from its critical value, for the normal phase of the system starting with these equations.

We note that, in the normal phase, the inverse susceptibility h/2M (\equiv\gamma_{n}) is nonzero. The equation of the \lambda line is given by \gamma_{n}\to 0_{+}. From (51) we obtain

\[\Omega_{B}(T,\gamma_{n})= \Omega_{0B}-(2V)^{-1}\sum_{q}^{\prime}\ \left[\frac{q^{2}}{2m_{B}}+\gamma_{n}\ \right]\] \[+(\beta V)^{-1}\sum_{q}^{\prime}\ln\sinh\frac{\beta}{2}\left[ \frac{q^{2}}{2m_{B}}+\gamma_{n}\ \right]\] \[-2un^{\ast 2}(T,\gamma_{n})\ ,\] (56)

where, in view of (50) and (52)-(54), \gamma_{n} is given by self-consistent equations

\[n^{\prime}(T,\gamma_{n})= \frac{1}{V}\sum_{q}^{\prime}\frac{1}{\left\{\exp\left[\beta\left[ \frac{q^{2}}{2m_{B}}+\gamma_{n}\ \right]-1\ \right]\ \right\}}\ ,\] (57) \[\gamma_{n}= -\mu_{B}+4un^{\ast}(T,\gamma_{n})\ .\]

Upon choosing \Omega_{0B}=(\beta V)^{-1}\Sigma_{q}^{\prime}\ln 2 the boson pressure (P) becomes \left[P_{0}(T,\gamma_{n})+2un^{\ast 2}(T,\gamma_{n})\right], where P_{0} is formwise the same as the ideal gas pressure. The choice is guided by the fact that, on turning off the interaction, \Omega_{B}(T,\gamma_{n}) should reduce to the thermodynamic potential of the ideal gas. The deviation in pressure from its \lambda-line value P_{C}(T,\mu_{BC}), where \mu_{BC}=4un^{\ast}(T,0) is the value of \mu_{B} on the \lambda line at a given T, is

\[\beta(P-P_{C})= \beta[P_{0}(T,\gamma_{n})-P_{0}(T,0)]\] \[+2\beta u[n^{\ast 2}(T,\gamma_{n})-n^{\ast 2}(T,0)]\ .\] (58)

We now split n^{\prime} above into two parts, viz., n^{\prime}_{1} and n^{\prime}_{h}, where the subscripts l and h, respectively, correspond to the momentum ranges 0<|q|<q_{0} and q_{0}<|q|<\infty. Since the \gamma_{n} dependence of n^{\prime} can be ignored for the latter range, we take q_{0}=\Gamma\sqrt{\gamma_{n}} with \Gamma\simeq 10\sqrt{2m_{B}}. As regards P_{0}(T,\gamma_{n}), we split it also into two parts, viz., P_{0l} and P_{0h}. It is well known [16, 17] that singularities, in various thermodynamic functions, near the \lambda line have their origin in the low-momentum (0<|q|<q_{0}) operators of the system. With all these in view, we write explicitly the part of \beta(P-P_{C}) which is a function of T and \gamma_{n} both and also correspond to low momenta:

\[\{\beta(P-P_{C})\}_{l}= \beta P_{0l}(T,\gamma_{n})\] \[+2\beta u[\,n^{\prime 2}_{h}(T,\gamma_{n})\] \[\qquad\qquad+2n^{\prime}_{h}(T,\gamma_{n})n^{\prime}_{l}(T,\gamma_{n})]\ .\] (59)

The high-momentum part, on the other hand, is given by the remaining terms in (58). Close to the \lambda line one may assume \beta\gamma_{n}<<1. For a (4-\epsilon)-dimensional system of bosons, one then obtains

\[\{\beta(P-P_{C})\}_{l}= B(T,\gamma_{n})\langle\beta\gamma_{n}\rangle^{2-\epsilon/2}\] \[+B^{\prime}(T)u(\beta\gamma_{n})^{2-\epsilon}+O(u\gamma_{n}^{3- \epsilon})\ ,\] (60)

where, to the leading order in \epsilon,  \[\begin{array}{l} B(T,\gamma_{n}) = \frac{\Gamma^{4}f_{0}}{16\pi^{2}\beta^{2}}\left[1 + \frac{\beta\gamma_{n}}{2f_{0}}\left[\frac{\Gamma^{2}}{2m_{B}}+1\right] + O(\beta\gamma_{n})^{2}\right]\ ,\\ f_{J} = \int_{0}^{1}\frac{x^{5 - 4}dx}{\left[x^{2} + \frac{2m_{B}}{\Gamma^{2}}\right]}\ ,\\ \end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{l} B^{*}(T) = \frac{m_{B}^{2}\Gamma^{4}f_{2}}{8\pi^{4}\beta^{2}}\left(f_  is not entirely valid for the ordered phase; in place of b(1+x)^{-d/5} [see Eq. (15) in the second paper in Ref. [8]] a structurally different term is present. These terms are, however, approximately equal in the weak interaction limit as well as in the opposite limit.

## II Thermodynamic potential of a Fermi system

\[\begin{array}{l} {\epsilon_{k} = \frac{1}{2}\left[\begin{array}{l} {\epsilon_{F}(k)}0\,  Here, m_{F} and m_{F}, respectively, denote the mass and chemical potential of a fermion. _V__kk_' denotes an attractive interaction potential. The subscripts 1 and 2 in (3), respectively, correspond to the two spin states 1 and 1 and angular brackets < > to the thermodynamic average calculated with H_{F}. Fermi statistics implies [5,11] that in this case, whereas (D11,D22) are odd functions of k, (D12,D21) are neither even nor odd. Equations for these gap functions will be written down towards the end of this section.

Our aim here is to establish a relation between the thermodynamic potential per unit volume

\[\Omega_{F} = - (\beta V)^{- 1} \ln {\rm Tr}\exp( - \beta H_{F})\]

of the assembly and certain spectral weight functions. Here, b denotes the inverse of the product of temperature T and Boltzmann constant k_{B}. The specific heat at constant volume will be calculated using this relation also to demonstrate its usefulness.

It is convenient to define a new potential per unit volume O_{F}(_l_) in terms of the Hamiltonian H_{F}(_l_) = _l__H__F_, where l is a variable, for the purpose stated above. One can write

\[\Omega_{F}(\lambda) = V^{- 1} \int \frac{d\lambda}{\lambda}\left( {H_{F}(\lambda)} \right)_{\lambda} + \Omega_{0F}\ ,\]

where the angular brackets < >l_A denote thermodynamic average calculated with H_{F}(_l_) and O_{F} is an integration constant to be specified later [see note below Eq. (28)]. The system under consideration corresponds to O_F_(_l_ = 1). Obviously, the task now boils down to establishing relations between the average < H_{F}(_l_)>l and spectral-weight functions.

The next step is to write down equations of motion for the averages \sum_{k}\left\langle {a^{\dagger}_{k\sigma}(t^{\prime})a_{k\sigma^{\prime}}(t^{\prime})} \right\rangle_{\lambda}. These equations yield

\[\left\langle {H_{F}(\lambda)} \right\rangle_{\lambda} = \frac{1}{4}\lim\limits_{t^{\prime}\to t}\sum_{k\sigma} \left[ {i\frac{\partial}{\partial t} - i\frac{\partial}{\partial t^{\prime}}} \right]\] \[\times \left\{ \left\langle {a^{\dagger}_{k\sigma}(t^{\prime})a  \[\xi(k) = \{(\,|\Delta_{11}|^{2} - |\Delta_{22}|^{2})^{2} + (\,|\Delta_{12}|^{2} - |\Delta_{21}^{2}|^{2})^{2} + 2(\Delta_{11}^{\dagger}\Delta_{12}^{\dagger} - \Delta_{12}^{\dagger}\Delta_{12})^{2} \}\]

In fact, as is expected, we have an expression for E_{k} which gives both the spin singlet (\Delta_{ij}=0 = \Delta_{21}^{\dagger}) and the spin triplet (\Delta_{21}^{\dagger}=0) excitation energies as special cases.

The gap functions (GF) occurring in the sum in (14) are not yet known. These functions can be expressed in terms of appropriate temperature Green's functions. As in the case of A_{F}(\pm k\sigma,\omega), GF's can then be obtained solving equations for Fourier coefficients corresponding to these temperature functions. Without showing any of the details, we write down here the self-consistent equations for GF's obtained by the above procedure:

\[\Delta_{ij}(k) = \sum_{k^{\prime}}V_{kk^{\prime}}\left[\,A_{ij}(k^{\prime})\tanh \frac{\beta E_{k^{\prime}}^{(1)}}{2} \right.\] (21) \[\left.\qquad\qquad\qquad+B_{ij}(k^{\prime})\tanh\frac{\beta E_{k^{ \prime 2}}^{(2)}}{2}\,\right]\,,\]

where i,j=1,2 and

\[A_{ij}(k) = -\frac{|G_{ij}^{(1)}(k)|}{2E_{k}^{(1)}(E_{k}^{(1)2} - E_{k}^{(2)2})}\,\,,\] \[B_{ij}(k) = \frac{|G_{ij}^{(2)}(k)|}{2E_{k}^{(2)}(E_{k}^{(1)2} - E_{k}^{(2)2})}\,\,,\] \[G_{ii}^{(1)}(k) = \begin{bmatrix}\Delta_{ii}(k)&\Delta_{jj}^{\dagger}(k)\\ \xi^{2}(k)&\eta_{1}^{2}(k)\end{bmatrix}\,,\,  singlet states, it reduces to the simple expression

\[\Omega_{FS} = - 2(\beta V)^{-1}\sum_{k}\ln\left\{1 + e^{-\beta E_{k}} \right\},\;\;\;E_{k} = (\epsilon_{F}^{2} + \Delta^{2})^{1/2}\;.\]

The entropy per unit volume, in view of the note below (28), is given by

\[C_{V} = \frac{- k_{B}\beta^{2}}{2V}\sum_{j = 1,2}\sum_{k}\;\left[ 2\frac{\partial E_{k}^{(j)}}{\partial\beta} + \beta\frac{\partial^{2}E_{k}^{(j)}}{\partial\beta^{2}} \right]e^{-\beta E_{k}^{(j)}/2}{\rm sech}\frac{\beta E_{k}^{(j)}}{2} + \frac{k_{B}\beta^{2}}{4V}\sum_{j = 1,2}\sum_{k}\;\left[ E_{k}^{(j)} + \beta\frac{\partial E_{k}^{(j)}}{\partial\beta} \right]^{2}{\rm sech}^{2}\frac{\beta E_{k}^{(j)}}{2}\;.\]

In the case of a BCS superconductor, (30) assumes the simple form

\[S_{FS} = - \frac{k_{B}\beta}{V}\sum_{k}\;\left[ E_{k} + \beta\frac{\partial E_{k}}{\partial\beta} \right]\;\left[ \tanh\frac{\beta E_{k}}{2} - 1\;\right]\] (32) \[+ \frac{k_{B}}{V}\sum_{k}2\ln\left\{1 + e^{-\beta E_{k}} \right\}\;.\]

The term

\[\left[ - k_{B}\beta V^{-1}\sum_{k}\beta(\partial E_{k}/\partial\beta)(\tanh\beta E _{k}/2 - 1)\;\right]\]

in (32) is a typical consequence of Fermi statistics, for Leggett's expression [5] for S_{FS}, calculated using Planck's formula and the ansatz that the probability of occurrence of ground pair, broken pair, and excited pair states are given by the Boltzmann distribution, does not contain this term. Near the critical temperature of the superconductor, this term may be assumed to be small compared to the other terms in (32) as the gap \Delta may be approximated by a constant at criticality. This emphasizes that the statistics does not play a significant role [4] in determining critical behavior of thermodynamic functions.

Other useful relations also exist for calculating thermodynamic potential of a Fermi system, e.g., the relation [14] for pure singlet states involving pair susceptibility. Sofo and Balseiro [15] used this relation to derive the thermodynamics of a two-dimensional electron gas in the low-density limit. However, as remarked by these authors, the correct way of doing the calculation is through the approach of Kadanoff and Baym. [1]\qquad\  venient to define a new thermodynamic potential per unit volume \Omega_{B}(\lambda) in terms of the Hamiltonian H^{\prime}_{B}(M,\lambda)\!=\!\lambda H^{\prime}_{B}(M). The potential \Omega_{B}(\lambda) will be then given by a relation similar to (5). Thus, as in the preceding section, the aim boils down to obtaining (H^{\prime}_{B}(M,\lambda))_{\lambda} in terms of weight functions.

To achieve this goal, we first set up equations of motion for the operators b_{q}(t), b^{\dagger}_{q}(t), etc., where

\[b_{q}(t)\!=\!e^{iH^{\prime}_{B}(M,\lambda)t}b_{q}e^{-iH^{\prime}_{B}(M,\lambda)t}\;.\] (38)

Next, we manipulate these equations to obtain

\[\!  \[\frac{h}{2M}=-\mu_{B}+\Sigma_{11}^{\bullet}(0,0)-\Sigma_{02}^{\bullet}(0,0)\ .\] (50)

Equation (50) is the equation to determine M. This corresponds to the finite temperature analogue [16, 17, 17] of the Hugenholtz-Pines theorem. The thermodynamic potential per unit volume, on the other hand, is given by

\[\Omega_{B}(\lambda=1)= \Omega_{0B}-hM+E_{0}(M)\] \[-\frac{1}{2V}\sum_{q}\left[\frac{q^{2}}{2m_{B}}+\frac{h}{2M}\ \right]\] \[+(\beta V)^{-1}\sum_{q}\ln\sinh\frac{\beta\epsilon_{q}}{2}\ .\] (51)

In the ordered phase, the equation to determine M and the thermodynamic potential per unit volume are obtained by taking the limits h\to 0 and h/M\to 0 (M\neq 0) in (50) and (51), respectively. The self-energies, in the approximation scheme of Ref. [16], are given by

\[\Sigma_{11}^{\bullet}(0,0)= \,2U(M)+4un^{\ast}(T,\Sigma_{11}^{\bullet},\Sigma_{02}^{\bullet})+ 2uy(T,\Sigma_{11}^{\bullet},\Sigma_{02}^{\bullet})\ ,\] (52) \[\Sigma_{02}^{\bullet}(0,0)=U(M)+2uy(T,\Sigma_{11}^{\bullet},\Sigma _{02}^{\bullet})\ ,\]

where

\[n^{\ast}= V^{-1}\sum_{q}\left(\,b_{q}^{\dagger}b_{q}\,\right)\] \[= \frac{1}{V}\sum_{q}\left[\begin{array}{c}\epsilon_{B}(q)+\Sigma _{11}^{\bullet}(0,0)\\ \epsilon_{q0}(\exp\beta\epsilon_{q0}-1)\end{array}\right.\] \[\qquad\qquad+\frac{\epsilon_{B}(q)+\Sigma_{11}^{\bullet}(0,0)- \epsilon_{q0}}{2\epsilon_{q0}}\ \right]\ ,\] (53) \[y= V^{-1}\sum_{q}\left\langle\,b_{q}\,b_{-q}\,\right\rangle\] \[= -\frac{1}{V}\sum_{q}\Sigma_{02}^{\bullet}(0,0)\left[\frac{1}{2 \epsilon_{q0}}+\frac{1}{\epsilon_{q0}(\exp\beta\epsilon_{q0}-1)}\ \right]\ ,\] (54) \[\epsilon_{q0}^{2}=\left[\frac{q^{2}}{2m_{B}}\ \right]\left[\frac{q^{2}}{2m_{B}}+2\Sigma_{02}^{\bullet}(0,0)\ \right]\ .\] (55)

The term E_{0}(M) is given by \left[\,-\mu_{B}M^{2}+uM^{4}-2un^{\ast 2}-up^{\ast 2}\right]. Equations (52)-(54) are the self-consistent equations for \Sigma_{11}^{\bullet}, \Sigma_{02}^{\bullet}, n^{\prime}, and y. Starting with Eqs. (51)-(55) the entire thermodynamics of a Bose system in the ordered phase can be derived. We now obtain crossover scaling forms [9, 9] for the susceptibility and the deviation of pressure from its critical value, for the normal phase of the system starting with these equations.

We note that, in the normal phase, the inverse susceptibility h/2M (\equiv\gamma_{n}) is nonzero. The equation of the \lambda line is given by \gamma_{n}\to 0_{+}. From (51) we obtain

\[\Omega_{B}(T,\gamma_{n})= \Omega_{0B}-(2V)^{-1}\sum_{q}^{\prime}\ \left[\frac{q^{2}}{2m_{B}}+\gamma_{n}\ \right]\] \[+(\beta V)^{-1}\sum_{q}^{\prime}\ln\sinh\frac{\beta}{2}\left[ \frac{q^{2}}{2m_{B}}+\gamma_{n}\ \right]\] \[-2un^{\ast 2}(T,\gamma_{n})\ ,\] (56)

where, in view of (50) and (52)-(54), \gamma_{n} is given by self-consistent equations

\[n^{\prime}(T,\gamma_{n})= \frac{1}{V}\sum_{q}^{\prime}\frac{1}{\left\{\exp\left[\beta\left[ \frac{q^{2}}{2m_{B}}+\gamma_{n}\ \right]-1\ \right]\ \right\}}\ ,\] (57) \[\gamma_{n}= -\mu_{B}+4un^{\ast}(T,\gamma_{n})\ .\]

Upon choosing \Omega_{0B}=(\beta V)^{-1}\Sigma_{q}^{\prime}\ln 2 the boson pressure (P) becomes \left[P_{0}(T,\gamma_{n})+2un^{\ast 2}(T,\gamma_{n})\right], where P_{0} is formwise the same as the ideal gas pressure. The choice is guided by the fact that, on turning off the interaction, \Omega_{B}(T,\gamma_{n}) should reduce to the thermodynamic potential of the ideal gas. The deviation in pressure from its \lambda-line value P_{C}(T,\mu_{BC}), where \mu_{BC}=4un^{\ast}(T,0) is the value of \mu_{B} on the \lambda line at a given T, is

\[\beta(P-P_{C})= \beta[P_{0}(T,\gamma_{n})-P_{0}(T,0)]\] \[+2\beta u[n^{\ast 2}(T,\gamma_{n})-n^{\ast 2}(T,0)]\ .\] (58)

We now split n^{\prime} above into two parts, viz., n^{\prime}_{1} and n^{\prime}_{h}, where the subscripts l and h, respectively, correspond to the momentum ranges 0<|q|<q_{0} and q_{0}<|q|<\infty. Since the \gamma_{n} dependence of n^{\prime} can be ignored for the latter range, we take q_{0}=\Gamma\sqrt{\gamma_{n}} with \Gamma\simeq 10\sqrt{2m_{B}}. As regards P_{0}(T,\gamma_{n}), we split it also into two parts, viz., P_{0l} and P_{0h}. It is well known [16, 17] that singularities, in various thermodynamic functions, near the \lambda line have their origin in the low-momentum (0<|q|<q_{0}) operators of the system. With all these in view, we write explicitly the part of \beta(P-P_{C}) which is a function of T and \gamma_{n} both and also correspond to low momenta:

\[\{\beta(P-P_{C})\}_{l}= \beta P_{0l}(T,\gamma_{n})\] \[+2\beta u[\,n^{\prime 2}_{h}(T,\gamma_{n})\] \[\qquad\qquad+2n^{\prime}_{h}(T,\gamma_{n})n^{\prime}_{l}(T,\gamma_{n})]\ .\] (59)

The high-momentum part, on the other hand, is given by the remaining terms in (58). Close to the \lambda line one may assume \beta\gamma_{n}<<1. For a (4-\epsilon)-dimensional system of bosons, one then obtains

\[\{\beta(P-P_{C})\}_{l}= B(T,\gamma_{n})\langle\beta\gamma_{n}\rangle^{2-\epsilon/2}\] \[+B^{\prime}(T)u(\beta\gamma_{n})^{2-\epsilon}+O(u\gamma_{n}^{3- \epsilon})\ ,\] (60)

where, to the leading order in \epsilon,  \[\begin{array}{l} B(T,\gamma_{n}) = \frac{\Gamma^{4}f_{0}}{16\pi^{2}\beta^{2}}\left[1 + \frac{\beta\gamma_{n}}{2f_{0}}\left[\frac{\Gamma^{2}}{2m_{B}}+1\right] + O(\beta\gamma_{n})^{2}\right]\ ,\\ f_{J} = \int_{0}^{1}\frac{x^{5 - 4}dx}{\left[x^{2} + \frac{2m_{B}}{\Gamma^{2}}\right]}\ ,\\ \end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{l} B^{*}(T) = \frac{m_{B}^{2}\Gamma^{4}f_{2}}{8\pi^{4}\beta^{2}}\left(f_  is not entirely valid for the ordered phase; in place of b(1+x)^{-d/5} [see Eq. (15) in the second paper in Ref. [8]] a structurally different term is present. These terms are, however, approximately equal in the weak interaction limit as well as in the opposite limit.
