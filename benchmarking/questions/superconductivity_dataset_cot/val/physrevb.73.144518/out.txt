## II Experiment

Polycrystalline samples of La1.85Sr0.15Cu1-Ti1O4 (_x_ = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06) and La1.85-2Sr0.15+2CaU1-Ti1O4 (_x_ = 0.00, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.11, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) were synthesized by means of a conventional solid state reaction method using appropriate powders of La2O3, SrCO3, TiO2, and CuO. The powders were mixed and prefired several times in air at 900 degC for a total period of about 36 h with a few intermediate grindings. The prefired materials were mixed and pressed into a pellet, followed by sintering in air at 1120-1230 degC for 24 h.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out using a Philips X'Pert Pro x-ray diffractometer with Cu _K_a radiation at room temperature to screen for the presence of impurity phase and the changes in structure. The lattice parameters were obtained by Rietveld refinement of the x-ray patterns. The resistance was measured using the standard four-probe method in a commercial Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS, 1.8 K <= 7 <= 400 K, 0 T <= H <= 9 T) from 5 to 300 K. The magnetic measurement was performed on a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) MPMS system under zero-field cooled (ZFC) mode for all samples in the temperature range from 5 to 300 K. For the La1.85-2xSr0.15+2Cu1-Ti1O4 (_x_ = 0.1) sample, ZFC magnetization measurement and field-cooled (FC) magnetization measurements were carried out in the temperature range from 5 to 50 K. The infrared (IR) transmission spectra were obtained (MAGNA-IR 750) using powder samples with KBr serving as a carrier over the frequency range 400-800 cm-1. The morphologies of these samples were investigated by the Scrion200 scanning electron microscope (SEM).

## III Results and Discussion

### Structure

We obtain pure phase samples of La1.85Sr0.15Cu1-xTi1O4 at doping levels x  0.06. Above this level, impurities emerge due to the fact that doping with Ti4+ cations at Cu2+ cations will lead to valence unbalance, which gives rise to preventing the preparation of pure-phase samples. In order to maintain the valence balance and achieve high doping level, we used the double-doped method, namely, the valence decrease that the increase in Sr2+ concentration and the decrease in La3+ concentration balances out the increasing valence due to the substitution of Ti4+ for Cu2+. By virtue of the double-doped technique, we successfully synthesized pure phase samples with La1.85-2Sr0.15+2CaU1-Ti1O4 (0 <= x <= 0.4).

XRD analysis shows that the samples of La1.85Sr0.15Cu1-Ti1O4 (_x_ = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06) and La1.85-2xSr0.15+2Cu1-Ti1O4 (_x_ = 0.00, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.11, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) are all crystallized in a single-phase tetragonal lattice with the space group I4/_mmm_, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The lattice parameters can be obtained by fitting the experimental spectra using the standard Rietveld technique.[16] The obtained lattice parameters are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. Clearly, with increasing Ti doping, the lattice parameter a increases monotonously, while c decreases. In addition, a monotonous decrease in _c/a_ can be seen in Figs. 3 and 4. The _c/a_ ratio is commonly used to characterize the Jahn-Teller distortion of the oxygen octahedron around Cu2+. It is obvious that Ti doping releases the Jahn-Teller distortion of the CuO6 octahedron. In order to prove the homogeneity of these samples, the morphologies of these samples were investigated with the Scrion200 scanning electron microscope (SEM). In Fig. 5, the SEM photograph shows that the grains are densely and regularly arranged, which indicates that the Ti4+ ions are distributed homogeneously in La1.85-2Sr0.15+2Cu1-xTi1O4 and no segregation of the secondary phase is observed.

We obtain pure phase samples of La1.85Sr0.15Cu1-xTi1O4 at doping levels of x  0.06, which by virtue of the double-doped technique, the pure phase samples can be obtained up to x = 0.4. In order to further explore the doping effect of Ti, the vibration modes in the Cu(Ti)O6 octahedron have been investigated by means of infrared (IR) transmission measurements. Figure 6 shows the IR transmission spectra of La1.85-2xSr0.15+2Cu1-Ti1O4 (0 <= x <= 0.4) samples. According to the earlier investigation,[17, 18, 19] the two IR modes about 503 cm-1 and 680 cm-1 in Fig. 6 are assigned to the stretching mode of apical oxygen atoms and the stretching mode of in-plane oxygen atoms, respectively. From Fig. 6 one can see that the _ν_1 = 503 cm-1 peak appears in all samples, while the _ν_2 peak only appears in 0.15 <= x <= 0.4 samples. With increasing Ti content, the _ν_1 mode slightly shifts to a high frequency while the other peak _ν_2 at 680 cm-1 emerges and its intensity increases with x for samples with x  0.2. Thus, based on the results of XRD and IR transmission spectra, we conclude that all samples are in a simple tetragonal phase, and the additional Sr sits only on the rare-earth sites and Ti only replaces Cu.

### Superconductivity

Figure 7 displays the temperature dependence of magnetization for La1.85Sr0.15Cu1-xTi1O4 (0 <= x <= 0.06). The inset in Fig. 7 reveals the diamagnetic behavior for the sample with x = 0. As can be seen from Fig. 7, the samples with x = 0.02 and 0.04 also show a diamagnetic signal and reveal the occurrence of superconductivity at about 31.0 K and 26.1 K, respectively. While there is no diamagnetism and the superconductivity is suppressed for the sample with x = 0.06. Figure 8 gives the temperature dependence of magnetization for La_{1.85-2\text{x}}Sr_{0.15+2\text{x}}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} (0 <= x = 0.08). The diamagnetism is observed for all the samples. The T_{c}^{\text{onset}} values are about 37 K, 32.8 K, 32.8 K, 30 K, and 30 K for samples with x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08, respectively. In the inset of Figs. 8(a) and 8(b) we give the enlarged views around the superconducting transition. Moreover, one can clearly see that the systems are in the paramagnetic state at temperatures higher than T_{c}^{\text{onset}} for samples with 0.04 <= x = 0.08, 0.

  \approx0.08. The Meissner volume decreases sharply with increasing Ti doping content in both series of samples.

### Coexistence and competition of superconductivity and paramagnetism

Figure 9 shows the temperature dependence of magnetization for the samples with x=0.1, 0.11 in the double-doped La_{1.85-2.5}Sr_{0.15+2.5}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} system. For the sample with x =0.1, the magnetization first presents the upturn and exhibits paramagnetic behavior with decreasing temperature until about 30 K, then it begins to decrease abruptly upon further cooling, the diamagnetic signal occurs at about 17 K and reaches a negative maximum at 11.3 K, and then it begins to increase abruptly, in which a valley is formed. In order to understand this magnetization behavior, we compared the ZFC and FC magnetization for this sample, as shown in the inset of Fig. 9(a). The applied magnetic field was 100 Oe. From the inset in Fig. 9(a) one can see that the temperature dependence of magnetization under the FC condition is similar to that under the ZFC condition except for the value of valley, which explains that the drop of the magnetic signal is attributed to the superconductive transition. For the sample with x=0.11, there is no diamagnetism and the superconductivity is suppressed. To understand whether it is the paramagnetic behavior before and after the superconductive transition for the sample with x=0.1, the Brillouin function is used to fit the M-T experimental data. It is well known that the Brillouin function [20, 21]B_{J} describes the temperature dependence of magnetization M for the paramagnet under the external magnetic field H and the quantum number J of the magnetic ion. The Brillouin function is

\[B_{J}(x)=\frac{2J+1}{2J}\coth(\frac{(2J+1)x}{2J})-\frac{1}{2J}\coth(\frac{x}{ 2J}),\] (1)

where x=\frac{g\mu_{B}H}{k_{B}T} (where g is spectroscopic splitting factor, \mu_{B} is the Bohr magnetron, k_{B} is Botzmann's constant, and T is

  temperature). Using the Brillouin function, the M as function of T can be described as

\[M = NgJ\mu_{B}B_{J}(x) = N\mu_{\rm eff}B_{J}(x),\] (2)

where N is the number of atoms with magnetism per unit volume, the effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff}(\mu_{\rm eff}=gJ\mu_{B}) is one of the fitting parameters and J is 1/2 for Cu2+. Figure 9(b) displays the fitting result for the sample with x=0.1. The effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff} can be obtained by this fitting as 1.49\mu_{B}. According to a mean field approximation,[22] the expected effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff} is 1.56\mu_{B}. The experimental effective magnetic moment is close to the calculated data. It can be seen in Fig. 9(b) that the data can fit the Brillouin function of paramagnetism very well before the superconducting transition. Below this transition, our experiment data fit the Brillouin function very well after subtracting the superconductive signal from the crude data. As a result, the coexistence and competition between the diamagnetism and paramagnetism exist in this doped system. At a low doping level, i.e., x\leq0.1, the diamagnetism overwhelms the paramagnetism. Thus these samples exhibit a superconducting transition. At the doping level 0.11\leqx\leq0.4, due to more and more Ti4+ ions being introduced into the lattice, which lead to more and more 3d electrons localized at Cu2+, the paramagnetism becomes stronger and stronger and overwhelmingly the diamagnetism; thus the paramagnetism is exhibited at this doping range, as shown in Figs. 9 and 10

### \rho-T relation

The temperature dependencies of resistivity for samples of La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} and La_{1.85-.2}Sr_{0.15+.2}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} are shown in Figs. 11 and 12, respectively. For La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} samples, the resistivity \rho increases dramatically with increasing Ti content. The sample with x =0 exhibits superconductivity at about 37 K. The resistivity of the sample with x=0.02 decreases gradually with decreasing temperature first and then displays an upturn; a broad dip can be observed at about 30 K. This dip reveals a weakened superconductivity as shown in the inset of Fig. 11. For the samples with x=0.04 and 0.06, the \rho shows semiconductor-like behavior. For La_{1.85-.2}Sr_{0.15+.2}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} samples, we notice that the doping of Ti depresses the superconductivity dramatically. For x=0.02, the \rho decreases gradually with decreasing temperature first and then shows an upturn at about 130 K, but finally drops at 15 K and decreases gradually with further cooling. This reveals a broadened superconducting transition. For the doping level 0.04\leqx\leq 0.08, the resistivity exhibits metal behavior at high temperature and semi

  conductorlike behavior at low temperature. Such a behavior has been observed in many transition-metal-doped La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{4+\delta} compounds.[6, 23, 24, 25, 26] For the doping level 0.1 <= x <= 0.4, these samples show semiconductor-like behavior throughout the measured temperature regime. From Figs. 11 and 12 we can see that the resistivity increases quickly with increasing x for two kinds of samples. For example, for the La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} samples, at about 40 K which is little higher than the _T_c for x = 0, the resistivity of x = 0.06 is about six orders of magnitude higher than that of x = 0. While for the La_{1.85-\Delta_{2}}Sr_{0.15+\Delta_{2}}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} samples, at about 40 K, the resistivity of x = 0.06 is only one order of magnitude higher than that of x = 0. The resistivity is larger in single-doped samples than that in double-doped samples at the same Ti doping content. We consider that the difference in normal state electrical transport is attributed to the change of the hole carrier in the CuO_{2} plane for the two series of samples. In single-doped samples, the substitution of high valence Ti introduces extra electrons and leads to the decrease of hole carrier concentration in the CuO_{2} plane. In double-doped samples, the hole carrier concentrations maintain unchanged due to the compensative effect. For the two systems, it is interesting that although the magnetization exhibits diamagnetism behavior in the La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} system at 0.02 <= x <= 0.04 and in the La_{1.85-2}Sr_{0.15+\Delta_{2}}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} system at the doping level 0.04 <= x <= 0.1 (see Figs. 7 and 8), the trace of superconductivity cannot be recognized electrically here. We consider that the reason for the absence of the temperature of zero resistivity may be attributed to the decrease of the superconducting volume fraction due to the addition of dopants, which can be observed from the ZFC results in our experiments. That is when the fraction of the superconductor is reduced to a critical value the superconducting phase cannot connect to each other and form a conductive path resulting in the absence of the temperature of zero resistivity. In other words, the superconductivity is immerged by the higher resistivity. Thus, the zero resistivity behaviour is not observed.

In the curves of resistivity versus temperature, the negative d\rho/d_T_ at lower temperature was usually regarded as evidence of the localized nature of the charge carriers.[27] The temperature dependence of resistivity fitted by variable range hopping model[28] (VRH) [\rho = exp(_T_0/_T_)1/4] for the samples with 0.04 <= x <= 0.4 is shown in Fig. 13. The results show that _ρ_-_T_ curves can be well described by the VRH model. The fitting parameter T0, which is a characteristic temperature related to the localization length x and the density of states _N_(_E_F) in the vicinity of the Fermi energy level, i.e., \kappa_{B}T_{0} = 21/[\xi^{3}N(E_{F})] is shown in Table I. From Table I, it is

  found that the T_{0} value increases obviously with the increase of Ti content, implying the decrease of the localization length and the reduction of the carrier mobility, which is in accordance with the magnetic and electronic transport properties for the samples

### Origin of suppressing superconductivity

From the above experimental results we notice that the doping of Ti ions suppresses the superconductivity. It is widely accepted that the Ti element is generally a stable tetravalent in transition-metal oxides. Moreover Ti^{4+} is a nonmagnetic cation because the electron configuration of the Ti^{4+} ion is 3p^{6}3d^{0}. In the Ti-doped samples, there is no exchange interaction between 2p orbit of O^{2-} and 3d orbit of Ti^{4+}. The Ti ions are distributed in the parent CuO_{2} plane individually and randomly and act as nonmagnetic impurities. Xiao _et al._[7] and Tarascon _et al._[8] have argued that nonmagnetic dopants such as Zn^{2+}, Ga^{3+}, Al^{3+} have an inert full-shell structure (3d^{0} and 3p^{6}) and their main role is to locally remove the spin of Cu^{2+} (3d^{0})(_s_=1/2), consequently, breaking the compensation and creating a net spin of _S_=1/2. They consider that it is the staggered magnetic moments that cause the magnetic pair breaking and depress the superconductivity. As a result, a similar moment can also be induced by doped Ti^{4+} at the Cu^{2+} site.

According to the conventional Abrikosov and Gork'ov theory[29] this magnetic pair-breaking effect can be expressed in the AG equation given as

\[Ln\frac{T_{c}}{T_{c0}}=\psi\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)-\psi\left(\frac{1}{2}+ \frac{2J^{2}S(S+1)N(E_{F})x}{2\kappa_{B}T_{c}}\right),\] (3)

where T_{c0} is the value of T_{c} at x=0. J is the constant for the exchange interaction between the hole spin and the spin of the 3d metal ions. S is the spin quantum number of the 3d element after substitution. The quantity N(E_{F}) is the density of states at the Fermi level, and \psi is the differential of the \Gamma function. When x is small, Eq. (3) can be interpreted as

\[T_{c0}-T_{c}=\frac{\pi^{2}J^{2}S(S+1)N(E_{F})x}{2\kappa_{B}}.\] (4)

If N(E_{F}) remains constant with increasing doping content, formula (4) can be described as

\[T_{c0}-T_{c}=Ax.\] (5)

Figure 14 shows the Ti content x dependence of T_{c}^{\rm onset} for our results as compared to the prediction of the magnetic pair-breaking mechanism which is denoted by the dashed line. It is obvious that the depression of T_{c} does not obey formula (5) for samples of the two systems. For the samples of La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{3}O_{4}, it seems to obey formula (5) for the samples with x\leq0.04. However, according to formula (5), the T_{c}^{\rm onset} value would drop to zero at the doping content x=0.122, while the experimental results indicate that the superconducting transitions disappear for the sample with x=0.06. These results indicate that the suppression of superconductivity does not result from the magnetic pair-breaking effects for the single-doped samples. Additionally, if the magnetic pair-breaking theory is correct in describing the high temperature superconductivity, the dopant concentration x_{c} of losing superconductivity in both the single-doped and double-doped LSCO should be the same. Unfortunately, this is not the case, as we describe above; there is a noticeable difference of dopant concentration x_{c} between the single-doped samples and the double-doped samples. These results indicate that the suppression of superconductivity cannot be attributed to the magnetic pair-breaking effect in the two series of samples. It is generally accepted that the free holes, which are active charge carriers responsible for superconductivity, exist in the CuO_{2} plane. We consider that the doping of high-valence Ti^{4+} not only blocks the Cu-O-Cu long-range hybridization, but also influences the carrier in the nearby Cu-O-Cu path. When the high-valence Ti^{4+} impurity elements are introduced into the CuO_{2} plane, the local number of the electrons around the impurity atoms is enhanced. The interaction between the electrons of the impurity atoms

  and the holes of the neighboring oxygen atoms will cause the holes to localize and lose their itinerancy and prevents them from condensing into pairs; then the superconductivity is suppressed. For singly doped La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} samples, the doping of high-valence Ti ions into Cu sites leads to a reduction in carrier concentration, while for doubly doped La_{1.85-2}Sr_{0.15+2}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} samples, due to the charge carrier compensation effect, this effect is weakened. Thus the suppression of superconductivity is less severe in double-doped samples than in single-doped samples.

It is well known that the undoped compound La_{2}CuO_{4} is an insulating antiferromagnet where the spin moments on adjacent Cu^{2+} ions are antiparallel.[30] The itinerant holes introduced by doping of Sr^{2+} depresses the superexchange interaction of Cu^{2+}-O-Cu^{2+} and consequently destroys the long-range AFM correlation. As a result, the relationship between the antiferromagnetism and the superconductivity in the CuO_{2} has been the focus of the cuprate superconductivity research. Previously we have investigated the high-valence Mn doped La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4} (LSCO),[4] where the double-doped La_{1.85-2}Sr_{0.15+2}Cu_{1-x}Mn_{x}O_{4} was used and we observed the superconductivity in competition with antiferromagnetic correlation between Mn ions which are confirmed to be tetravalent. However, this competition has not been observed in the high-valence Ti doped La_{1.85-2}Sr_{0.15+2}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} system. As we know, both the (La/Sr)_{2}CuO_{4} and the (La/Sr)_{2}MnO_{4} have the same K_{2}NiF_{4} structure and can exist independently. When prepared by the conventional solid-state reaction method, it is much possible for the (La/Sr)_{2}MnO_{4} to exist independently in the (La/Sr)_{2}CuO_{4}, so the Mn-O-Mn and Cu-O-Cu can exist in the same planes. Naturally, Mn ions easily close to each other and form antiferromagnetic correlation in the double-doped La_{1.85-2}Sr_{0.15+2}Cu_{1-x}Mn_{x}O_{4} system. However, it is different in the high-valence Ti doped La_{1.85-2}Sr_{0.15+2}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} system. Moreover Ti^{4+} is a nonmagnetic cation because the electron configuration of the Ti^{4+} ion is 3p^{6}3d^{0}. In the Ti-doped samples, there is no exchange interaction of p holes with the 3d electrons in the O^{2-}L-Ti^{4+} (L is a 2p hole in oxygen) groups. When Ti^{4+} ions become adjacent with other Ti^{4+} ions, a strong localized stress come into being, this induces a larger aberrance. Therefore, the Ti ions would be distributed in the parent CuO_{2} plane individually and randomly.

## IV IV. Conclusions

In summary, the effects of Ti doping of La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4} have been studied by means of measurements of the magnetic susceptibility and electrical transport. We obtain pure phase samples of La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} at doping levels x\ll 0.06, while by virtue of the double-doping technique, we successfully synthesized pure phase samples of La_{1.85-2}Sr_{0.15+2}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} (0 \leq x \leq 0.4). This indicates that the double-doping process is effective in improving the doping level at the Cu site with high-valence transition elements due to the compensation of charge carriers in the CuO_{2} plane. The magnetization measurements indicate that the critical Ti doping level (above which the superconductivity is suppressed) of double-doped samples are much higher than that of the single-doped samples. For the single-doped samples, the diamagnetic signal is observed at the doping levels x \leq 0.04, while for the double-doped samples the diamagnetism can survive upon replacing 10% of planar Cu ions with Ti ions. The resistivity measurements show that the depression of T_{c} is less sharp in double-doped samples than in single-doped samples. For the single-doped samples, at about 40 K which is little higher than the T_{c} for x=0, the resistivity of x=0.06 is about six orders of magnitude higher than that of x=0. While for the double-doped samples, at about 40 K, the resistivity of x = 0.06 is only one order of magnitude higher than that of x = 0. Those experimental results are understood in terms of the charge carrier compensation effect. Doping with Ti leads to the localization of hole carriers. The suppression of superconductivity is most likely due to the localization of hole carriers and not due to the pair-breaking effect induced by nonmagnetic disorder.

## II Experiment

Polycrystalline samples of La1.85Sr0.15Cu1-Ti1O4 (_x_ = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06) and La1.85-2Sr0.15+2CaU1-Ti1O4 (_x_ = 0.00, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.11, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) were synthesized by means of a conventional solid state reaction method using appropriate powders of La2O3, SrCO3, TiO2, and CuO. The powders were mixed and prefired several times in air at 900 degC for a total period of about 36 h with a few intermediate grindings. The prefired materials were mixed and pressed into a pellet, followed by sintering in air at 1120-1230 degC for 24 h.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out using a Philips X'Pert Pro x-ray diffractometer with Cu _K_a radiation at room temperature to screen for the presence of impurity phase and the changes in structure. The lattice parameters were obtained by Rietveld refinement of the x-ray patterns. The resistance was measured using the standard four-probe method in a commercial Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS, 1.8 K <= 7 <= 400 K, 0 T <= H <= 9 T) from 5 to 300 K. The magnetic measurement was performed on a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) MPMS system under zero-field cooled (ZFC) mode for all samples in the temperature range from 5 to 300 K. For the La1.85-2xSr0.15+2Cu1-Ti1O4 (_x_ = 0.1) sample, ZFC magnetization measurement and field-cooled (FC) magnetization measurements were carried out in the temperature range from 5 to 50 K. The infrared (IR) transmission spectra were obtained (MAGNA-IR 750) using powder samples with KBr serving as a carrier over the frequency range 400-800 cm-1. The morphologies of these samples were investigated by the Scrion200 scanning electron microscope (SEM).

## III Results and Discussion

### Structure

We obtain pure phase samples of La1.85Sr0.15Cu1-xTi1O4 at doping levels x  0.06. Above this level, impurities emerge due to the fact that doping with Ti4+ cations at Cu2+ cations will lead to valence unbalance, which gives rise to preventing the preparation of pure-phase samples. In order to maintain the valence balance and achieve high doping level, we used the double-doped method, namely, the valence decrease that the increase in Sr2+ concentration and the decrease in La3+ concentration balances out the increasing valence due to the substitution of Ti4+ for Cu2+. By virtue of the double-doped technique, we successfully synthesized pure phase samples with La1.85-2Sr0.15+2CaU1-Ti1O4 (0 <= x <= 0.4).

XRD analysis shows that the samples of La1.85Sr0.15Cu1-Ti1O4 (_x_ = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06) and La1.85-2xSr0.15+2Cu1-Ti1O4 (_x_ = 0.00, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.11, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) are all crystallized in a single-phase tetragonal lattice with the space group I4/_mmm_, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The lattice parameters can be obtained by fitting the experimental spectra using the standard Rietveld technique.[16] The obtained lattice parameters are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. Clearly, with increasing Ti doping, the lattice parameter a increases monotonously, while c decreases. In addition, a monotonous decrease in _c/a_ can be seen in Figs. 3 and 4. The _c/a_ ratio is commonly used to characterize the Jahn-Teller distortion of the oxygen octahedron around Cu2+. It is obvious that Ti doping releases the Jahn-Teller distortion of the CuO6 octahedron. In order to prove the homogeneity of these samples, the morphologies of these samples were investigated with the Scrion200 scanning electron microscope (SEM). In Fig. 5, the SEM photograph shows that the grains are densely and regularly arranged, which indicates that the Ti4+ ions are distributed homogeneously in La1.85-2Sr0.15+2Cu1-xTi1O4 and no segregation of the secondary phase is observed.

We obtain pure phase samples of La1.85Sr0.15Cu1-xTi1O4 at doping levels of x  0.06, which by virtue of the double-doped technique, the pure phase samples can be obtained up to x = 0.4. In order to further explore the doping effect of Ti, the vibration modes in the Cu(Ti)O6 octahedron have been investigated by means of infrared (IR) transmission measurements. Figure 6 shows the IR transmission spectra of La1.85-2xSr0.15+2Cu1-Ti1O4 (0 <= x <= 0.4) samples. According to the earlier investigation,[17, 18, 19] the two IR modes about 503 cm-1 and 680 cm-1 in Fig. 6 are assigned to the stretching mode of apical oxygen atoms and the stretching mode of in-plane oxygen atoms, respectively. From Fig. 6 one can see that the _ν_1 = 503 cm-1 peak appears in all samples, while the _ν_2 peak only appears in 0.15 <= x <= 0.4 samples. With increasing Ti content, the _ν_1 mode slightly shifts to a high frequency while the other peak _ν_2 at 680 cm-1 emerges and its intensity increases with x for samples with x  0.2. Thus, based on the results of XRD and IR transmission spectra, we conclude that all samples are in a simple tetragonal phase, and the additional Sr sits only on the rare-earth sites and Ti only replaces Cu.

### Superconductivity

Figure 7 displays the temperature dependence of magnetization for La1.85Sr0.15Cu1-xTi1O4 (0 <= x <= 0.06). The inset in Fig. 7 reveals the diamagnetic behavior for the sample with x = 0. As can be seen from Fig. 7, the samples with x = 0.02 and 0.04 also show a diamagnetic signal and reveal the occurrence of superconductivity at about 31.0 K and 26.1 K, respectively. While there is no diamagnetism and the superconductivity is suppressed for the sample with x = 0.06. Figure 8 gives the temperature dependence of magnetization for La_{1.85-2\text{x}}Sr_{0.15+2\text{x}}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} (0 <= x = 0.08). The diamagnetism is observed for all the samples. The T_{c}^{\text{onset}} values are about 37 K, 32.8 K, 32.8 K, 30 K, and 30 K for samples with x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08, respectively. In the inset of Figs. 8(a) and 8(b) we give the enlarged views around the superconducting transition. Moreover, one can clearly see that the systems are in the paramagnetic state at temperatures higher than T_{c}^{\text{onset}} for samples with 0.04 <= x = 0.08, 0.

  \approx0.08. The Meissner volume decreases sharply with increasing Ti doping content in both series of samples.

### Coexistence and competition of superconductivity and paramagnetism

Figure 9 shows the temperature dependence of magnetization for the samples with x=0.1, 0.11 in the double-doped La_{1.85-2.5}Sr_{0.15+2.5}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} system. For the sample with x =0.1, the magnetization first presents the upturn and exhibits paramagnetic behavior with decreasing temperature until about 30 K, then it begins to decrease abruptly upon further cooling, the diamagnetic signal occurs at about 17 K and reaches a negative maximum at 11.3 K, and then it begins to increase abruptly, in which a valley is formed. In order to understand this magnetization behavior, we compared the ZFC and FC magnetization for this sample, as shown in the inset of Fig. 9(a). The applied magnetic field was 100 Oe. From the inset in Fig. 9(a) one can see that the temperature dependence of magnetization under the FC condition is similar to that under the ZFC condition except for the value of valley, which explains that the drop of the magnetic signal is attributed to the superconductive transition. For the sample with x=0.11, there is no diamagnetism and the superconductivity is suppressed. To understand whether it is the paramagnetic behavior before and after the superconductive transition for the sample with x=0.1, the Brillouin function is used to fit the M-T experimental data. It is well known that the Brillouin function [20, 21]B_{J} describes the temperature dependence of magnetization M for the paramagnet under the external magnetic field H and the quantum number J of the magnetic ion. The Brillouin function is

\[B_{J}(x)=\frac{2J+1}{2J}\coth(\frac{(2J+1)x}{2J})-\frac{1}{2J}\coth(\frac{x}{ 2J}),\] (1)

where x=\frac{g\mu_{B}H}{k_{B}T} (where g is spectroscopic splitting factor, \mu_{B} is the Bohr magnetron, k_{B} is Botzmann's constant, and T is

  temperature). Using the Brillouin function, the M as function of T can be described as

\[M = NgJ\mu_{B}B_{J}(x) = N\mu_{\rm eff}B_{J}(x),\] (2)

where N is the number of atoms with magnetism per unit volume, the effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff}(\mu_{\rm eff}=gJ\mu_{B}) is one of the fitting parameters and J is 1/2 for Cu2+. Figure 9(b) displays the fitting result for the sample with x=0.1. The effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff} can be obtained by this fitting as 1.49\mu_{B}. According to a mean field approximation,[22] the expected effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff} is 1.56\mu_{B}. The experimental effective magnetic moment is close to the calculated data. It can be seen in Fig. 9(b) that the data can fit the Brillouin function of paramagnetism very well before the superconducting transition. Below this transition, our experiment data fit the Brillouin function very well after subtracting the superconductive signal from the crude data. As a result, the coexistence and competition between the diamagnetism and paramagnetism exist in this doped system. At a low doping level, i.e., x\leq0.1, the diamagnetism overwhelms the paramagnetism. Thus these samples exhibit a superconducting transition. At the doping level 0.11\leqx\leq0.4, due to more and more Ti4+ ions being introduced into the lattice, which lead to more and more 3d electrons localized at Cu2+, the paramagnetism becomes stronger and stronger and overwhelmingly the diamagnetism; thus the paramagnetism is exhibited at this doping range, as shown in Figs. 9 and 10

### \rho-T relation

The temperature dependencies of resistivity for samples of La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} and La_{1.85-.2}Sr_{0.15+.2}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} are shown in Figs. 11 and 12, respectively. For La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} samples, the resistivity \rho increases dramatically with increasing Ti content. The sample with x =0 exhibits superconductivity at about 37 K. The resistivity of the sample with x=0.02 decreases gradually with decreasing temperature first and then displays an upturn; a broad dip can be observed at about 30 K. This dip reveals a weakened superconductivity as shown in the inset of Fig. 11. For the samples with x=0.04 and 0.06, the \rho shows semiconductor-like behavior. For La_{1.85-.2}Sr_{0.15+.2}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} samples, we notice that the doping of Ti depresses the superconductivity dramatically. For x=0.02, the \rho decreases gradually with decreasing temperature first and then shows an upturn at about 130 K, but finally drops at 15 K and decreases gradually with further cooling. This reveals a broadened superconducting transition. For the doping level 0.04\leqx\leq 0.08, the resistivity exhibits metal behavior at high temperature and semi

  conductorlike behavior at low temperature. Such a behavior has been observed in many transition-metal-doped La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{4+\delta} compounds.[6, 23, 24, 25, 26] For the doping level 0.1 <= x <= 0.4, these samples show semiconductor-like behavior throughout the measured temperature regime. From Figs. 11 and 12 we can see that the resistivity increases quickly with increasing x for two kinds of samples. For example, for the La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} samples, at about 40 K which is little higher than the _T_c for x = 0, the resistivity of x = 0.06 is about six orders of magnitude higher than that of x = 0. While for the La_{1.85-\Delta_{2}}Sr_{0.15+\Delta_{2}}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} samples, at about 40 K, the resistivity of x = 0.06 is only one order of magnitude higher than that of x = 0. The resistivity is larger in single-doped samples than that in double-doped samples at the same Ti doping content. We consider that the difference in normal state electrical transport is attributed to the change of the hole carrier in the CuO_{2} plane for the two series of samples. In single-doped samples, the substitution of high valence Ti introduces extra electrons and leads to the decrease of hole carrier concentration in the CuO_{2} plane. In double-doped samples, the hole carrier concentrations maintain unchanged due to the compensative effect. For the two systems, it is interesting that although the magnetization exhibits diamagnetism behavior in the La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} system at 0.02 <= x <= 0.04 and in the La_{1.85-2}Sr_{0.15+\Delta_{2}}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} system at the doping level 0.04 <= x <= 0.1 (see Figs. 7 and 8), the trace of superconductivity cannot be recognized electrically here. We consider that the reason for the absence of the temperature of zero resistivity may be attributed to the decrease of the superconducting volume fraction due to the addition of dopants, which can be observed from the ZFC results in our experiments. That is when the fraction of the superconductor is reduced to a critical value the superconducting phase cannot connect to each other and form a conductive path resulting in the absence of the temperature of zero resistivity. In other words, the superconductivity is immerged by the higher resistivity. Thus, the zero resistivity behaviour is not observed.

In the curves of resistivity versus temperature, the negative d\rho/d_T_ at lower temperature was usually regarded as evidence of the localized nature of the charge carriers.[27] The temperature dependence of resistivity fitted by variable range hopping model[28] (VRH) [\rho = exp(_T_0/_T_)1/4] for the samples with 0.04 <= x <= 0.4 is shown in Fig. 13. The results show that _ρ_-_T_ curves can be well described by the VRH model. The fitting parameter T0, which is a characteristic temperature related to the localization length x and the density of states _N_(_E_F) in the vicinity of the Fermi energy level, i.e., \kappa_{B}T_{0} = 21/[\xi^{3}N(E_{F})] is shown in Table I. From Table I, it is

  found that the T_{0} value increases obviously with the increase of Ti content, implying the decrease of the localization length and the reduction of the carrier mobility, which is in accordance with the magnetic and electronic transport properties for the samples

### Origin of suppressing superconductivity

From the above experimental results we notice that the doping of Ti ions suppresses the superconductivity. It is widely accepted that the Ti element is generally a stable tetravalent in transition-metal oxides. Moreover Ti^{4+} is a nonmagnetic cation because the electron configuration of the Ti^{4+} ion is 3p^{6}3d^{0}. In the Ti-doped samples, there is no exchange interaction between 2p orbit of O^{2-} and 3d orbit of Ti^{4+}. The Ti ions are distributed in the parent CuO_{2} plane individually and randomly and act as nonmagnetic impurities. Xiao _et al._[7] and Tarascon _et al._[8] have argued that nonmagnetic dopants such as Zn^{2+}, Ga^{3+}, Al^{3+} have an inert full-shell structure (3d^{0} and 3p^{6}) and their main role is to locally remove the spin of Cu^{2+} (3d^{0})(_s_=1/2), consequently, breaking the compensation and creating a net spin of _S_=1/2. They consider that it is the staggered magnetic moments that cause the magnetic pair breaking and depress the superconductivity. As a result, a similar moment can also be induced by doped Ti^{4+} at the Cu^{2+} site.

According to the conventional Abrikosov and Gork'ov theory[29] this magnetic pair-breaking effect can be expressed in the AG equation given as

\[Ln\frac{T_{c}}{T_{c0}}=\psi\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)-\psi\left(\frac{1}{2}+ \frac{2J^{2}S(S+1)N(E_{F})x}{2\kappa_{B}T_{c}}\right),\] (3)

where T_{c0} is the value of T_{c} at x=0. J is the constant for the exchange interaction between the hole spin and the spin of the 3d metal ions. S is the spin quantum number of the 3d element after substitution. The quantity N(E_{F}) is the density of states at the Fermi level, and \psi is the differential of the \Gamma function. When x is small, Eq. (3) can be interpreted as

\[T_{c0}-T_{c}=\frac{\pi^{2}J^{2}S(S+1)N(E_{F})x}{2\kappa_{B}}.\] (4)

If N(E_{F}) remains constant with increasing doping content, formula (4) can be described as

\[T_{c0}-T_{c}=Ax.\] (5)

Figure 14 shows the Ti content x dependence of T_{c}^{\rm onset} for our results as compared to the prediction of the magnetic pair-breaking mechanism which is denoted by the dashed line. It is obvious that the depression of T_{c} does not obey formula (5) for samples of the two systems. For the samples of La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{3}O_{4}, it seems to obey formula (5) for the samples with x\leq0.04. However, according to formula (5), the T_{c}^{\rm onset} value would drop to zero at the doping content x=0.122, while the experimental results indicate that the superconducting transitions disappear for the sample with x=0.06. These results indicate that the suppression of superconductivity does not result from the magnetic pair-breaking effects for the single-doped samples. Additionally, if the magnetic pair-breaking theory is correct in describing the high temperature superconductivity, the dopant concentration x_{c} of losing superconductivity in both the single-doped and double-doped LSCO should be the same. Unfortunately, this is not the case, as we describe above; there is a noticeable difference of dopant concentration x_{c} between the single-doped samples and the double-doped samples. These results indicate that the suppression of superconductivity cannot be attributed to the magnetic pair-breaking effect in the two series of samples. It is generally accepted that the free holes, which are active charge carriers responsible for superconductivity, exist in the CuO_{2} plane. We consider that the doping of high-valence Ti^{4+} not only blocks the Cu-O-Cu long-range hybridization, but also influences the carrier in the nearby Cu-O-Cu path. When the high-valence Ti^{4+} impurity elements are introduced into the CuO_{2} plane, the local number of the electrons around the impurity atoms is enhanced. The interaction between the electrons of the impurity atoms

  and the holes of the neighboring oxygen atoms will cause the holes to localize and lose their itinerancy and prevents them from condensing into pairs; then the superconductivity is suppressed. For singly doped La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} samples, the doping of high-valence Ti ions into Cu sites leads to a reduction in carrier concentration, while for doubly doped La_{1.85-2}Sr_{0.15+2}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} samples, due to the charge carrier compensation effect, this effect is weakened. Thus the suppression of superconductivity is less severe in double-doped samples than in single-doped samples.

It is well known that the undoped compound La_{2}CuO_{4} is an insulating antiferromagnet where the spin moments on adjacent Cu^{2+} ions are antiparallel.[30] The itinerant holes introduced by doping of Sr^{2+} depresses the superexchange interaction of Cu^{2+}-O-Cu^{2+} and consequently destroys the long-range AFM correlation. As a result, the relationship between the antiferromagnetism and the superconductivity in the CuO_{2} has been the focus of the cuprate superconductivity research. Previously we have investigated the high-valence Mn doped La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4} (LSCO),[4] where the double-doped La_{1.85-2}Sr_{0.15+2}Cu_{1-x}Mn_{x}O_{4} was used and we observed the superconductivity in competition with antiferromagnetic correlation between Mn ions which are confirmed to be tetravalent. However, this competition has not been observed in the high-valence Ti doped La_{1.85-2}Sr_{0.15+2}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} system. As we know, both the (La/Sr)_{2}CuO_{4} and the (La/Sr)_{2}MnO_{4} have the same K_{2}NiF_{4} structure and can exist independently. When prepared by the conventional solid-state reaction method, it is much possible for the (La/Sr)_{2}MnO_{4} to exist independently in the (La/Sr)_{2}CuO_{4}, so the Mn-O-Mn and Cu-O-Cu can exist in the same planes. Naturally, Mn ions easily close to each other and form antiferromagnetic correlation in the double-doped La_{1.85-2}Sr_{0.15+2}Cu_{1-x}Mn_{x}O_{4} system. However, it is different in the high-valence Ti doped La_{1.85-2}Sr_{0.15+2}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} system. Moreover Ti^{4+} is a nonmagnetic cation because the electron configuration of the Ti^{4+} ion is 3p^{6}3d^{0}. In the Ti-doped samples, there is no exchange interaction of p holes with the 3d electrons in the O^{2-}L-Ti^{4+} (L is a 2p hole in oxygen) groups. When Ti^{4+} ions become adjacent with other Ti^{4+} ions, a strong localized stress come into being, this induces a larger aberrance. Therefore, the Ti ions would be distributed in the parent CuO_{2} plane individually and randomly.

## IV IV. Conclusions

In summary, the effects of Ti doping of La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4} have been studied by means of measurements of the magnetic susceptibility and electrical transport. We obtain pure phase samples of La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} at doping levels x\ll 0.06, while by virtue of the double-doping technique, we successfully synthesized pure phase samples of La_{1.85-2}Sr_{0.15+2}Cu_{1-x}Ti_{x}O_{4} (0 \leq x \leq 0.4). This indicates that the double-doping process is effective in improving the doping level at the Cu site with high-valence transition elements due to the compensation of charge carriers in the CuO_{2} plane. The magnetization measurements indicate that the critical Ti doping level (above which the superconductivity is suppressed) of double-doped samples are much higher than that of the single-doped samples. For the single-doped samples, the diamagnetic signal is observed at the doping levels x \leq 0.04, while for the double-doped samples the diamagnetism can survive upon replacing 10% of planar Cu ions with Ti ions. The resistivity measurements show that the depression of T_{c} is less sharp in double-doped samples than in single-doped samples. For the single-doped samples, at about 40 K which is little higher than the T_{c} for x=0, the resistivity of x=0.06 is about six orders of magnitude higher than that of x=0. While for the double-doped samples, at about 40 K, the resistivity of x = 0.06 is only one order of magnitude higher than that of x = 0. Those experimental results are understood in terms of the charge carrier compensation effect. Doping with Ti leads to the localization of hole carriers. The suppression of superconductivity is most likely due to the localization of hole carriers and not due to the pair-breaking effect induced by nonmagnetic disorder.
