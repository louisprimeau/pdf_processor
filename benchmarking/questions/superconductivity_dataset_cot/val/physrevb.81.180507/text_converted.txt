20 March 20102 melting and the buttons were wrapped in Ta foil and
annealed under vacuum at 500 degC for 2 weeks. X-ray diffraction
measurements reveal the main phase is CePt₂In₇, which crystallizes in
the body-centered _14_/_mmm_ space group with lattice parameters a =
4.611(1) A and c = 21.647(3) A, consistent with a previous report.[16]
Two samples were measured: sample A, in which extensive measurements of
ac calorimetry were performed contained <2 vol

Figure (1a) shows that the structure of CePt₂In₇ is comprised of a
single CeIn₃ plane and two PtIn₂ layers stacked along the c axis of the
tetragonal unit cell; this is a more two-dimensional variant of a new
structure type in the Ce_(m)M₂In_(3m + 2n) family. While the CeIn₃ block
is similar to CeM₂In₅, the Ce-Pt bond distance is much longer
($R_{\rm Ce-Pt}$= 4.98 A) in this body-centered CePt₂In₇ structure than
the Ce-M bond distance in the CeM₂In₅ compounds ($R_{\rm Ce-}M$ = 3.77
A) [Fig. 1(b)], which decreases the _f-d_ hybridization that has
consequences for superconductivity as discussed below. The specific heat
of CePt₂In₇, plotted as C/T vs T, is displayed in Fig. 1(c). The peak at
T_(N)=5.5 K is indicative of a second-order transition to an
antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. A fit of the data to C/T= γ= βT² between
12 <T< 19 K, yields γ=340 mJ/mol K² and β =2.88 mJ/mol K⁴ (corresponding
to a Debye temperature θ_(D)=189 K). This Sommerfeld coefficient is
similar to that of CeRhIn₅ (Ref. [12]) and implies a large effective
mass enhancement in CePt₂In₇. After subtraction of the βT³ phonon term,
the entropy amounts to S_(el)∼ 1/3R ln(2) at the Neel transition [Fig.
1(c) inset]. Further evidence for the antiferromagnetic transition is
provided by susceptibility measurements (not shown) and a change in
slope at 5.5 K of the electrical resistivity ρ(T) displayed in the inset
of Fig. 1(c). A fit to the data for T<πT_(N) of ρ(T)= ρ₀+A7² yields A
=0.10 μD cm/K². Assuming the Kadowaki-Woods relation,[18] this value of
A implies a Sommerfeld coefficient γ=100 mJ/mol K², which is comparable
to the extrapolated zero-temperature value of 50 mJ/mol K² in Fig. 1.
This value of γ in the ordered state is about seven times smaller than
γ(T>T_(N)), which is typical of Ce-based magnets.[19] No
superconductivity is found above 50 mK in CePt₂In₇ in 0.1 T at ambient
pressure.

Figure 2 provides evidence for pressure-induced bulk superconductivity
in CePt₂In₇ from ac-calorimetry measurements, plotted as C/T vs T at
various pressures up to P = 3.53 GPa as shown in Fig. 2(a) on sample A.
The anomaly at T_(N)=5.5 K increases with pressure up to ∼1.8 GPa, then
decreases rapidly above that pressure such that only a broad anomaly is
observed at 3 K at 3.12 GPa. Below 3 K, a single peak is found below 1
GPa due to the AFM transition of a Ce₃Pt₄In₁₃ impurity phase [Fig.
2(b)], which follows the monotonic behavior found previously up to 1.26
GPa.[20] Above 1 GPa, another peak attributed to bulk superconductivity
is observed, the temperature of which increases monotonically with
pressure from T_(c)=1.2 K (1.4 GPa) to 1.75 K (2.85 GPa) and the peak
height remains small where there is coexistence with AFM order. Above
2.85 GPa, the superconducting anomaly increases up to T_(c)=2.1 K and
the specific-heat jump DC is largest at 3.53 GPa where the Neel
transition extrapolates to zero temperature.

The temperature-pressure (_T_-_P_) phase diagram of CePt₂In₇ is shown in
Fig. 3(a). The AFM transition first increases with pressure up to 1.5
GPa then decreases with increasing pressure and is absent once it
intersects superconductivity. Superconductivity appears at ∼1 K above 1
GPa and reaches a maximal value of _T_c=2.1 K at _P_c=3.5 GPa where
_T_N(_P_) extrapolates to _T_=0 K. Electrical-resistivity measurements
confirm a superconducting state and are generally consistent with the
ac-calorimetry data. As with CeRhIn₅[12], resistivity gives slightly
higher _T_c’s when AFM order is present.

Several properties provide strong evidence for an enhancement of the
effective mass near the antiferromagnetic quantum critical point in
CePt₂In₇. Accompanying a large increase in the specific-heat jump at
_T_c, ΔC/C_(N), as P →_P_c [Fig. 3(c)], the initial slope of the upper
critical field −dH_(c2)/dT_(c), from Fig. 3(b), is 1.08, 4.50, and 5.52
T/K at _P_=2.45 GPa, 2.95 GPa, and 3.0 GPa, respectively. With
−dH_(c2)/dT_(c)∼ m⁺2T_(c), this implies that m⁺∼ 60m_(e), 80m_(e), and
90m_(e) in this pressure sequence.[21] In addition, as shown in Fig.
3(d) the normal-state _T_c coefficient of _ρ_ increases rapidly upon
approaching _P_c, which is expected as a quantum critical point is
approached.[4] At 3 GPa and 9 T [>_H_c2(0)], A = 4.03 μΩ cm/K², which is
40 times larger than the value at ambient pressure. From the
Kadowaki-Woods ratio, this A implies γ=630 μΩ/mol K², which is nearly
twice the paramagnetic value at ambient pressure. We also note that this
_γ_ may be underestimated because A was determined in a high field.

The picture that emerges is that the effective mass of CePt₂In₇ is
enhanced on approaching the antiferromagnetic quantum critical point at
_P_c=3.5 GPa. A broad dome of superconductivity with a maximum _T_c of
2.1 K appears close to this critical pressure. The large initial slope
of the upper critical field and specific-heat jump near _P_c indicate
intimate involvement of heavy quasiparticles in the superconductivity,
and the remarkable similarity to CeRhIn₅ (Ref. [12]) suggests that the
superconductivity also is unconventional. As shown in Fig. 1(d), the
calculated Fermi surface of CePt₂In₇ is comprised of three, nearly ideal
cylindrical sheets, compared to corrugated cylindrical sheets in
CeRhIn₅, one of which is shown in Fig. 1(e). Recent NMR measurements
provide further evidence for the two-dimensional nature of CePt₂In₇ and
the presence of 2D antiferromagnetic fluctuations above _T_N_(s)[22]
Thus, it appears that 2D AFM critical fluctuations at the QCP dictate
the behavior of CePt₂In₇.

Though the more two-dimensional crystal structure (and fluctuations) of
CePt₂In₇ might be expected to lead to a higher _T_c than in any CeMIn₅
material,[5] weaker _f-d_ hybridization may limit the value of _T_c in
CePt₂In₇. Support for this possibility is provided by calculations
comparing the density of states (DOS) of CeRhIn₅ and CePt₂In₇. The
paramagnetic scalar-relativistic projected electron DOS vs E relative to
the Fermi energy E for Ce 4_f, Rh 4d, and Pt 5d is shown in Fig. 4. The
Rh 4d and Pt 5d states are located about 2-3 eV below _E_F,
respectively, while the Ce 4f states are located 0.5 eV above _E_F. The
extra electron of Pt does not significantly

affect the band structure and only shifts E_(F) up by ∼0.1 eV. There is
some hybridization between Ce 4f and Rh 4d, which produces a gap near
E_(F) that is found as well in more sophisticated local-density
approximation plus dynamical mean field theory calculations.[15] In
contrast, hybridization between Ce 4f and Pt 5d is sufficiently weak to
obscure a gap, if present at all. This difference is due in part to the
larger nearest-neighbor Ce-M bond distance in CePt₂In₇ compared to that
in CeRhIn₅, which may account in part for the higher pressure necessary
to suppress magnetic order in CePt₂In₇.

An interesting question is whether higher T_(c)’s might be found in
other hypothetical CeM₂In₇ (M = Co, Rh, Pd, Pt) compounds. In the Ce115
family, the transition metal tunes hybridization between the 4f and
out-of-plane In, which appears to be a dominating factor.[15] In the
Ce127 structure, the In(3) site plays the equivalent role (Fig. 1), and
we consider specifically the effect that the In(3) bandwidth might have
on T_(c). A Lorentzian fit to the In(3) DOS (not shown) yields a
bandwidth $W^{\rm(III)}$ of 3.6 eV, 5.9 eV, 4.1 eV, and 5.0 eV for M =
Co, Rh, Pd, and Pt, respectively. Hybridization of Ce f and In p
electrons will broaden the f level to a width Γ =
π⟨V_(kj)²⟩N_(p)^(eff)(E_(F)) in the Kondo limit, where V_(kj)² is the
matrix element that mixes f-electron/conduction-electron states. As
argued earlier,[14, 23]Γ sets the energy scale for superconductivity in
families of strongly correlated systems, i.e., Γ ∝ T₀∝ T_(c). Assuming
⟨V_(kj)²⟩ is a constant in this structure and that N_(p)^(eff)(E_(F)) ∼
1 / $W^{\rm(III)}$, then from the relation T_(c) ∝ T₀.[14] we expect a
higher T_(c) for M = Co and Pd and a lower T_(c) for M = Rh (relative to
2.1 K in CePt₂In₇). These very qualitative estimates suggest that the
hybridization and anisotropy may be further optimized in these
two-dimensional CeM₂In₇. More realistic calculations and the search for
additional CeM₂In₇ materials are worthwhile.

In summary, the heavy electron antiferromagnet CePt₂In₇ is a new, more
two-dimensional member of the Ce_(m)M₂In₈_(m = 2n) family. Bulk
superconductivity with a maximum transition temperature T_(c) = 2.1 K is
induced as magnetic order is tuned toward an antiferromagnetic quantum
critical point at a critical pressure P_(c) = 3.5 GPa. An analysis of
physical properties reveals an enhancement of the effective mass near
the QCP, possibly associated with 2D AFM fluctuations.
Electronic-structure calculations indicate relatively weaker f-d
hybridization in CePt₂In₇ compared to CeRhIn₅ but greater anisotropy in
the 127 structure compensates this effect to give a comparable T_(c) in
both systems. Further enhancement of T_(c) may be found in other CeM₂In₇
materials.
