###### Abstract

The upper critical field H_{c2} of \alpha-Ti_{1-x}Al_{x}(0 < x \approx 0.1) alloys has been investigated in detail. The behaviors can well be described by the theory of type-II superconductors. The electronic specific heat deduced from the superconducting properties is in excellent agreement with previous calorimetric measurements. However, the Fermi velocity obtained here is substantially lower than predicted by band calculation. The present work gives clear evidence that pure Ti is an intrinsic type-II superconducting element due to its very low renormalized Fermi velocity.

The theoretical understanding of conventional superconductivity has had great triumph as we now not only know the basic microscopic mechanism of its occurrence, but also can often be successful in correlating the superconducting properties of a specific material with its thermodynamical and microscopic parameters.^{1} The experimental demonstration of the success is, however, mostly biased to materials with cubic structures because of their importance for application. Comparatively, much less data were accumulated for metals of, say, _hcp_ structure which usually have very low superconducting transition temperature T_{c} . Therefore, detailed measurements of the superconducting properties on these materials in themselves could be very valuable in balancing our knowledge on the phenomenon. Here we report a systematic investigation of the upper critical field H_{c2} of a series of _hcp_ Ti_{1-x}Al_{x}(0 < x \approx 0.1) alloys. The system was chosen for the following additional reasons: (1) The _hcp_ \alpha-TiAl phase is stable up to ~11 at. % Al. In the whole doping range, the lattice parameters change very little. The widths of the x-ray diffraction peaks do not show appreciable degradation by introducing 10 at. % Al.^{2} (2) Band-structure calculation shows that the addition of Al into _a_-Ti does not disturb the _d_-band structure. Adding 10 at.% Al only slightly shifts the Fermi energy and causes a mere density of states (DOS) decrease of ~7 %.^{3} (3) T_{c} of _a_-TiAl alloy is very low, leaving enough room for independent measurements of the normal properties related to the superconductivity of the materials. Since the residual resistivity r0 of the alloy changes by about two orders between pure Ti and Ti_{0.9}Al_{0.1}, it provides a very clean case for the investigation of how the theory works in the wide range from clean limit to dirty limit by nearly a mere change of scattering rate. The present measurements are in excellent consistency with the theory for type-II superconductors. The results give unambiguous evidence that pure Ti is an intrinsic type-II superconductor due to its very low renormalized Fermi velocity.

The _a_-Ti_{1-x}Al_{x} samples were prepared by arc melting with Al concentration up to 10 at. %. Appropriate amount of Ti (99.995% pure) and Al (99.999% pure) were arc melted several times. The melted ingots were then annealed at 900 ^{\circ}C for one week.^{4} X-ray diffraction with very sharp peaks shows that all the samples had well crystallized single-phase _hcp_ structure without preferential orientation.^{2} The lattice parameters slightly decrease by introducing Al with very small anisotropy. The relative changes of the lattice parameters between pure Ti and Ti_{0.9}Al_{0.1} are about 0.5% for _a_/_a_, and ~0.2% for _a_/_c_/_c_. We will ignore the anisotropy in the follwing treatment.^{5} We expect that this simplification does not influence the main conclusion of the paper as no preferential orientiation exists in our samples and therefore the equivalent isotropic average should be on equal footing for different samples.

The experiments were conducted in a dilution refrigerator with a superconducting magnet. The preliminary result of the T_{c} change with Al concentration were reported elsewhere.^{2} The critical field was determined by the middle points of resistivity change in a sweeping field using four-lead ac measurements. The relative widths of the transition (10-90 %)

  were ~10% or less for all the samples at very low temperature, the uncertainty rises to ~14% near T_{c}. The temperature was very slowly swept from ~40 mK to the zero field T_{c} of the samples. As will be demonstrated below, the measured critical field is actually the upper critical field H_{c2} of the samples. Different criterion (80%, 50%, and 20% of the transition) lead to a fluctuation of ~+- +- 5% in H_{c2} and less than ~+- +- 5% in dH_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}}.

Four samples were measured and the results are shown in Fig. 1. A collection of the data together with the samples' normal-state resistivities are listed in Table I. The behavior of a type-II superconductor has been successfully described by the Ginzburg-Landau-Abrikosov-Gorkov (GLAG) theory, especially near T_{c}, where the following relationship precisely holds:6

Footnote 6: Extrapolated to T = 0 by polynomial fitting of the data.

\[\begin{split}-\frac{dH_{c2}}{dT}\bigg{|}_{T_{c}}=& \frac{\eta_{H_{c2}}(T_{c})}{R(\lambda_{tr})}\Bigg{[}\left(\frac{24\pi^{2}}{7 \zeta(3)}\frac{k_{B}^{2}c}{\hbar\epsilon}\right)\frac{T_{c}}{v_{F}^{\pm 2}}\\ &+\Bigg{(}\frac{12\pi}{7\zeta(3)}\frac{k_{B}c}{e}\frac{1}{v^{\pm }l}\Bigg{)}\Bigg{]}\\ &=\frac{\eta_{H_{c2}}(T_{c})}{R(\lambda_{tr})}\Bigg{[}3.18\times 10^{16}\frac{T_{c}}{v_{F}^{\pm 2}}+5.26\times 10^{4}\gamma^{\pm 9}\rho_{0}\Bigg{]}\end{split}\] (1)

where \eta_{H_{c2}}(T_{c}) is the ratio of the strong-coupled magnetic pair-breaking parameter to the weak-coupled BCS value, \lambda_{tr} is about the ratio of the zero-temperature GL coherence length \xi_{GL}(0), the transport scattering length l, R(\lambda_{tr}) is a function weakly depending on \lambda_{tr} [R(0) = 1,R(\infty) = 1.17], v_{F}^{\pm} in cm/s and \gamma^{\pm 9} in erg/cm^{3}K^{2} are, respectively, the renormalized Fermi velocity and electronic specific-heat coefficient, and \rho_{0} in \Omega cm is the residual resistivity. Since \eta_{H_{c2}}(T_{c}) is close to unity and the deviation depends on the ratio of (T_{c}/\omega_{0})^{2}, where \omega_{0} is the equivalent Einstein frequency, we expect \eta_{H_{c2}}(T_{c}) = 1 for our \alpha-TiAl samples. To see whether our \alpha-TiAl samples can be described by GLAG theory, Eq. (1) can be written as

\[\left.\frac{R(\lambda_{tr})}{T_{c}}\frac{dH_{c2}}{dT}\right|_{T_{c}}=3.18\times 10^{16}v_{F}^{\pm -2}+5.26\times 10^{4}\gamma^{\pm}\frac{\rho_{0}}{T_{c}},\] (2)

taking \eta_{H_{c2}}(T_{c}) = 1. We see, by plotting [R(\lambda_{tr})/T_{c}](dH_{c2}/dT)\big{|}_{T_{c}} as a function of \rho_{0}/T_{c}, that we should get a straight line if v_{F}^{\pm} and \gamma^{\pm 9} are independent of doping. The result is shown in Fig. 2. The fitting curve slightly bends down from a straight line. However, if we take into account the Al-induced decrease of DOS,3 then the correction factor would straighten the curve to coincide with the dashed line of the figure. Since we have no adjustable parameter in the treatment, the excellent agreement between our data with Eq. (2) demonstrates that introducing Al into \alpha-Ti does not appreciably change the band Fermi velocity v_{F} as well as the electron-phonon coupling \lambda_{ep}, in agreement with the fact that no topological defects are introduced in the process. According to Eq. (2), from the slope we can get the renormalized electronic specific-heat coefficient, which gives \gamma^{\pm 9}\sim 3 mJ/cm^{3} K^{2}, in satisfactory consistency with calorimetric data (\gamma^{\pm 9}\sim 3.15 mJ/cm^{3} K^{2}).7 The intercept leads to the renormalized Fermi velocity v_{F}^{\pm}\sim 4.1\times10^{6} cm/s, a value substantially lower than predicted by the band calculation (\sim 2.2\times10^{7}).8 To check the correctness of the result, we notice that we could have more precise conclusion from the H_{c2}(0) data. It is easy to write down the relation:9

Footnote 9: Obtained by polynomial fitting.

\[H_{c2}(0)=\frac{\phi_{0}}{2\,\pi\xi_{GL}^{2}(0)}=\frac{\phi_{0}}{2\,\pi} \Bigg{[}\frac{12}{7\,\xi(3)}\frac{4\,\pi^{2}k_{B}T_{c}^{2}}{h^{2}v_{F}^{\pm 2}}\frac{(1+\lambda_{tr})}{R(\lambda_{tr})},\] (3)

where \phi_{0} is the flux quantum and \xi_{GL}(0) is zero-temperature Ginzburg-Landau coherence length. Similar to Eq. (2), we can modify Eq. (3):

\[\frac{H_{c2}(0)}{T_{c}^{2}}=3.17\times 10^{15}v_{F}^{\pm-2}+3.06\times 10^{4}\gamma^{\pm}\frac{\rho_{0}}{T_{c}}.\] (4)

When we plot H_{c2}(0)/T_{c}^{2} as a function of \rho_{0}/T_{c} (Fig. 3), we get behavior that is very similar to Fig. 2. The results give \gamma^{\pm 0}\sim 3.1 mJ/cm^{3} k^{2} and v_{F}^{\pm 0}\sim 4.6\times10^{6} cm/s. Again, \gamma^{\pm 8} is in excellent agreement with [7] and v_{F} is in reasonable agreement with that obtained by the H_{c2} slope at T_{c}.

Figure 2: [R(\lambda_{tr})/T_{c}](dH_{c2}/dT)|_{T_{c}} as a function of \rho_{0}/T_{c}. The dashed line is the slope at \rho_{0}\sim0. When the change of \gamma^{\pm 9} with Al concentration is taken into account, all the data points fall on the dashed line. The slope of the dashed line gives the electronic specific-heat coefficient \gamma^{\pm 9} of pure Ti, while the intercept gives the Fermi velocity v_{F}^{\pm} (see text).

  The success of GLAG relationships in describing our \alpha-TiAl samples and the constant v_{F}^{\ast} for different samples allows us to separate H_{c2}(0) and dH_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}} into two parts which, according to Eqs. (2) and (4), correspond, respectively, to the values in clean limit and dirty limit:

\[R(\lambda_{tr})H_{c2}^{\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \,\  sistivity could be the largest among the transition metals.[1] We will leave the matter to future theoretical and experimental investigations. A very important, though surprising, consequence of this very low \nu_{F}^{\ast} is that pure Ti is actually an intrinsic type-II superconducting element, contrary to previous conclusions. The evidence for this conclusion is so strong that it can never be ascribed to the limited precision of the expressions and is far beyond the uncertainty of the measurements. A collection of the superconducting parameters as a function of residual resistivity is listed in Table II.

In summary, by introducing Al into \alpha-Ti, we were able to change the impurity scattering rate by almost two orders with the topological lattice structure and electronic band structure least perturbed. The alloys provided a clean case where we can demonstrate that the theory of type-II superconductors is applicable to \alpha-TiAl alloys in a very wide range from the clean limit to dirty limit. The results give convincing evidence that pure Ti is an intrinsic type-II superconductor with the lowest T_{c} up to now due to its very low renormalized Fermi velocity.

The experiments were carried out by using the dilution refrigerator belonging to the State Laboratory of Surface Physics, CAS. The work was supported by National Foundation of China.
