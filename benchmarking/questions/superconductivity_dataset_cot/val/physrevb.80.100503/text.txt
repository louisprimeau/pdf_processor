\({}^  spin gap \(\Delta\) and coefficient \(A\) in Eq. (1) decrease with increasing pressure. The values of \(A\) at ambient pressure, 3.5 and 3.8 GPa are in a ratio of about 6:4:1. The activated-type contribution fades out with increasing pressure, although both mechanisms coexist in the relevant pressure regime. The rate \(1/T_{1}\) under extremely high pressure is expected to become \(1/T_{1}T\)=constant. The \(P\) dependence of both \(B\) and \(\Delta\) is shown in Fig. 2, together with that of \(T_{c}\) determined from the resistivity measurements. The data determined from the onset and zero resistivity are plotted in Fig. 2. We also plotted the data of \(T_{c}\) determined from the inductance of the NMR probe. Our results show that \(\Delta\) is almost the same up to the onset pressure, but decreases drastically above it. Corresponding to \(\Delta\), \(B\) shows a remarkable upturn toward the optimal pressure. The upturn of \(B\) (=\(T\) independent) means that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation hardly affects the enhancement of \(T_{c}\); when antiferromagnetic fluctuations are predominant such as high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates, \(T\) dependence of \(1/T_{1}T\) shows a upturn toward \(T_{c}\).

An increase in \(D(E_{F})\) is also observed from the Knight shift for \(\textbf{{H}}\)\(\parallel\)c; the spin-gap behavior observed clearly at 3.5 GPa almost vanishes at 3.8 GPa (see Fig. 3). The Knight shift is decomposed into the orbital and spin parts; \(K^{c}\) =\(K^{c}_{orb}\)+\(K^{c}_{spin}\). The orbital part \(K^{c}_{orb}\) is almost unchanged for a pressure of 3.5-3.8 GPa as explained in the following paragraphs. Therefore, the spin part \(K^{c}_{spin}\) or \(X_{spin}\), which is proportional to \(D(E_{F})\) in a normal metal, is enhanced with increasing pressure. We estimated \(K^{c}_{orb}\) from the NQR measurements because \(K^{c}_{orb}\) is related to the NQR frequency \(\nu\) as

\[K^{c}_{orb}=\alpha\nu+\beta.\] (2)

The relation is derived from Eqs. (3)-(5) in the following paragraphs.

Before presenting the results, we state the NQR results measured at 4.2 K. The NQR spectra at 3.5 GPa and ambient pressure are shown in Fig. 4. We measured the NQR signals up to 40 MHz with a resolution of 0.1 MHz/point. The signals originating from the ladder and chain sites were observed at 10-25 and 30-35 MHz, respectively. At ambient pressure, \({}^{63}\)Cu and \({}^{65}\)Cu signals are clearly assigned only in case of chain sites, whereas they overlap with each other in case of ladder sites. The overlap is decomposed into two Gaussian functions. The resonance position is almost the same as that measured in an earlier study.[29] At 3.5 GPa, the signals arising from the ladder sites move to high frequencies, whereas those from the chain sites move to low frequencies. The broadening of the line width is caused by

  stress anisotropy, which appears when pressure mediation liquid freezes during the pressurizing process. The \(P\) dependence of the NQR frequencies is shown in Fig. 5. The \({}^{63}\)Cu signals move by 2.27 and \(-\)0.69 MHz for the ladder and chain sites, respectively, and those of \({}^{65}\)Cu move by 1.05 and \(-\)0.60 MHz for the ladder and chain sites, respectively. The \(n\) in Eq. (2) is determined by two factors; the electric-field gradient (EFG) arising from the hole number of the \(3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\) orbital, \(n_{3d}\) and that arising from the surrounding 4\(p\) orbitals. In high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates, the latter contribution is not so sensitive to doping level; therefore, \(n\) is determined mainly by \(n_{3d}\),

\[\nu = n_{3d}\nu_{3d}+\nu_{4p}\] (3)

where \(\nu_{4p}\) = \(-\)65 MHz and \(\nu_{3d}\) = \(-\)117 MHz are estimated.[30] Equation (3) can be applied to both ladder and chain sites of Sr\({}_{14-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{41}\) as well as high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates. The increase in the number of holes at the ladder Cu sites comes from the chain sites. We estimated \(n_{3d}\) from the resonance frequencies of \({}^{63}\)Cu as 0.716 and 0.736 at ambient pressure and 3.5 GPa, respectively.

The hole number is related to the orbital susceptibility \(\chi_{orb}\), namely, \(K_{orb}^{c}\). The orbital susceptibility for \(\bm{H}\)|c is expressed in the same way with high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates[31] as

\[\frac{\chi_{orb}}{N} = n_{3d}\frac{2\mu_{B}^{2}}{E_{xy}-E_{x^{2}-y^{2}}}\] (4)

where \(N\) is the Avogadro number and \(\mu_{B}\) is the Bohr magnetron. \(E_{xy}\) and \(E_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\) represent energy levels of the \(3d_{xy}\) and \(3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\) orbitals, respectively. The energy difference between them is estimated to be 4.8 eV from the cluster model.[32]\(K_{orb}^{c}\) is linked with \(\chi_{orb}\) as

\[K_{orb}^{c} = A^{orb}\chi_{orb}/N\mu_{B}\] (5)

where \(A^{orb}(=2\mu_{B}(1/r^{3})),\langle 1/r^{3}\rangle\) being a radius average for a Cu ion, is a hyperfine field due to the orbital moment induced by the applied field. \(A^{orb}\) is estimated as 1028 (kOe/\(\mu_{B}\)) using \(\langle 1/r^{3}\rangle\) = 8.252 a.u., a value for a free Cu\({}^{2+}\) ion.[33] From Eqs. (4) and (5), \(K_{orb}^{c}\) = 0.248\(n_{3d}\)(%) is obtained. A \(K_{orb}^{c}\) of 0.18% is estimated in a pressure of 3.5-3.8 GPa. The estimate shows that \(K_{spin}^{c}\) is enhanced at the optimum pressure.

The increase in \(T_{c}\) or \(D(E_{F})\) is determined by two factors; the hole number and the band width. The hole number seems to increase beyond the optimal pressure, as is expected from Fig. 5, whereas the band width tends to broaden with increasing pressure. Therefore, the dome-shaped \(T_{c}\) curve arises from naive balance between the two factors: the transfer of holes to the ladder sites increases DOS below the optimal pressure, whereas the broadening of the band width would cause a decrease in DOS over the optimal pressure.

Anomalous behavior, namely, that \(K_{spin}^{c}\) is finite below \(T_{c}\), is actually observed at rather high fields. If it is related to quasinone dimensionality, the singlet-FFLO phase transition is a candidate that can explain the anomaly. In this scenario, \(K_{spin}^{c}\) or \(\chi_{spin}\) at a low field would decrease with decreasing temperature below \(T_{c}\). Although NMR measurements at a low field is important, it is difficult to curry out because the overlapped NQR signals in Fig. 4 hardly split at a low field.

In summary, we have measured \(1/T_{1}\) at an optimal pressure of 3.8 GPa, and observed transitional features from the spin-gapped state to the Fermi-liquid state; the activated-type contribution fades out and approaches the Korringa relation with increasing pressure. This implies that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation is not important unlike high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates. The enhancement of \(T_{c}\) or an increase in DOS at the Fermi energy originates from an increase in the number of holes transferred from the chain sites.
