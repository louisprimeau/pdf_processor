###### Abstract

While the layered 122 iron arsenide superconductors are highly anisotropic, unconventional, and exhibit several forms of electronic orders that coexist or compete with superconductivity in different regions of their phase diagrams, we find in the absence of iron in the structure that the superconducting characteristics of the end member BaPd_{2}As_{2} are surprisingly conventional. Here we report on complementary measurements of specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, resistivity measurements, Andreev spectroscopy, and synchrotron high pressure x-ray diffraction measurements supplemented with theoretical calculations for BaPd_{2}As_{2}. Its superconducting properties are completely isotropic as demonstrated by the critical fields, which do not depend on the direction of the applied field. Under the application of high pressure, T_{c} is linearly suppressed, which is the typical behavior of classical phonon-mediated superconductors with some additional effect of a pressure-induced decrease in the electronic density of states and the electron-phonon coupling parameters. Structural changes in the layered BaPd_{2}As_{2} have been studied by means of angle-dispersive diffraction in a diamond-anvil cell. At 12 GPa and 24.2 GPa we observed pressure induced lattice distortions manifesting as the discontinuity and, hence discontinuity in the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. The bulk modulus is B_{0}=40(6) GPa below 12 GPa and B_{0}=142(3) GPa below 27.2 GPa.

## I Introduction

In conventional superconductors, the electron-phonon interaction gives rise to the attraction between electrons near the Fermi surface with opposite momenta and opposite spins, which eventually causes superconductivity and conservation of the time-reversal symmetry [1]. The discovery of superconductivity up to 55 K in iron-based pnictides has been at the forefront of interest in the scientific community over the last few years [2, 3, 4, 5]. These materials have multiple Fermi pockets with electronlike and holelike dispersion of carriers. For the BaFe_{2}As_{2} (BFA) parent compound, the electron doping is induced by substitution of Ni, Co, Rh, and Pd at the Fe sites, which have more d electrons than Fe [6, 7, 8]. The parent compound BFA itself is not superconducting but features two forms of highly correlated electronic orders. One is the antiferromagnetic spin density wave (SDW) of stripe-type order in which chains of parallel spins are adjacent to chains with opposite spin direction [9]. In addition to this SDW order a spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry (nematic order) from a high-temperature tetragonal (C_{4}) symmetry to a low temperature orthorhombic structure occurs [9]. The nematic order is most likely due to an electronic instability that causes pronounced in-pane anisotropy of the Fe-As layers [10]. Upon doping, both forms of static orders coexist with superconductivity in a wide range of their phase diagram, and it is still unclear whether they are beneficial or competing with superconductivity. The compound BaPd_{2}As_{2} in the focus of this paper represents the end member of the Pd-doped series and exists in the form of two types of crystal structures: ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-structure type ({\it 14}/mmm) and CeMg_{2}Si_{2}-structure type ({\it P4}/mmm) [11, 12]. The former structure has bulk superconductivity with T_{c}=3.85 K, while in the latter structure only filamentary superconductivity was observed below 2 K. This shows that the crystal structure has a predominant effect on the superconducting properties of these systems [13, 14, 15]. Given that Fe likely has a leading effect on the high  temperature superconductivity in doped BFA, the effect of partial substitution of Fe on superconducting properties in general and on their anisotropy evolution remains unaddressed. The heavily hole-doped compounds differ from their optimally doped counterparts by the presence of particularly strong electronic correlations [16], which is seen in their substantially larger reported mass enhancements compared to those of the optimally doped compounds. For instance, it is well established that CaFe_{2}As_{2} is less correlated than KFe_{2}As_{2} at ambient pressure [17, 18]. Therefore, it is necessary to deeper investigate the evolution of physical properties of the BFA system under various doping, including end members of the 122 family with fully substituted Ba, Fe, and As.

In particular, due to the lack of systematic experiments, a comprehensive and complete picture on the iron-free layered pnictide superconductor BaPd_{2}As_{2} is still lacking. Here, we performed thermodynamic, transport, magnetotransport, local spectroscopy measurements, and first principle calculations in order to unravel the nature of the superconductivity in the BaPd_{2}As_{2} system. Specifically, we examined the electronic properties of BaPd_{2}As_{2} single crystal using a combination of specific heat (down to 400 mK), magnetic susceptibility, resistivity measurements (down to 400 mK and under pressure up to 11 GPa), Andreev reflection spectroscopy (down to 1.4 K), and first-principles calculations. We found that BaPd_{2}As_{2} as the end member of the substituted series of BaFe_{2-x}Pd_{x}As_{2} appears to behave surprisingly different from the parent compound BaFe_{2}As_{2}. While highly unconventional superconductivity can be induced by doping or application of pressure in BaFe_{2}As_{2}, the end member BaPd_{2}As_{2} in which all iron is completely replaced by Pd, appears to be a very conventional classical s-wave superconductor most probable, with phonon-mediated pairing. All Fe-based 122 superconductor materials are layered compounds and are expected to show highly anisotropic superconducting parameters. While such anisotropy is indeed found in the iron based superconductors, the superconducting properties of BaPd_{2}As_{2} are isotropic. This demonstrates the important role of the iron in the iron-based superconductors, which causes all the unconventional effects, including the competing or coexisting orders such as spin density waves and nematic orders, that appear to be completely absent in BaPd_{2}As_{2}.

## II Experimental

Single crystals of ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type BaPd_{2}As_{2} were successfully prepared by a self-flux method, details for the growth process and sample characterization were published elsewhere [12]. Low temperature transport and specific heat (down to 400 mK) were measured with a physical property measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design). Four contacts were used to measure the high-pressure in-plane resistivity with the superconductor BaPd_{2}As_{2} set in a diamond anvils cell in the PPMS-9 T. A single crystal was loaded in the sample space formed by c-BN gasket of around 130 \mum in diameter. We used an insulating gasket made of the mixture of cubic boron nitride with epoxy. Daphne oil 7373 was used as a pressure medium. Pressure was calibrated by using several ruby chips with dimensions of about 1 \mum that were placed into the cell along with the sample at room temperature [19]. Four Pt leads with thickness of about 1 \mum and the width of about 7-12 \mum were used for 4-probe measurements. The DC magnetization was measured in the Quantum Design SQUID VSM magnetometer with magnetic fields applied parallel and perpendicular to the ab plane. For the parallel field configuration the sample was attached with vacuum grease to a quartz sample holder, which allowed us to rotate the sample at room temperature in the grease so that different in-plane field orientations could be realized. AC magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed with an AC field at a frequency of 10 Hz and amplitude of 3.86 Oe over the pressure range of 0-5 GPa in a commercial SQUID magnetometer. Pressure was attained by a miniature diamond anvil cell (DAC) which was designed to be inserted into the SQUID magnetometer [20]. In the sample chamber, the crystals were immersed into a pressure transmitting medium, Apiezon J oil, together with a piece of ruby as the manometer. Pressure calibration was performed using the ruby fluorescence method at room temperature [19]. Multiple Andreev reflection effect (MARE) spectroscopy of superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SnS) junctions was performed using the break-junction technique [21, 22]. MARE occurs in the ballistic regime of SnS junctions and causes excess current at low bias voltages (so-called foot) and a subharmonic gap structure. This structure consists of a series of dips in dynamic conductance, each dip corresponding to voltage values V_{n}=2\Delta/en, where \Delta is the superconducting gap, e is the elementary charge, and n=1, 2,...is the subharmonic order. First-principles calculations are performed with plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) implemented in Quantum Espresso [23]. The _in situ_ high-pressure x-ray diffraction(\lambda=0.4066 A) measurement was performed with an angle-dispersive synchrotron x-ray diffraction mode (ADXRD) at beamline 16 IDB of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The as-prepared single crystal sample was crushed to powder and loaded into a gasketed diamond anvil cell (DAC) with silicon oil as a pressure-transmitting medium up to 30.3 GPa.

## III Results and Discussion

### Thermodynamic studies

The isothermal magnetization M vs H loops H\|ab and H\|c at different temperatures up to 3.75 K is shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively. The fact that the hysteresis loops for both orientations are point symmetric at the origin points to relatively weak surface barriers, and thus is indicative of bulk pinning [Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)]. This consideration applies to all data up to T_{c} and ensures that vortex penetration occurs at a field near the lower critical field, H_{c1}. In contrast, when surface barriers were predominant, the first vortex entrance would take place at much higher field (\approxH_{c}). This is a very important point to obtain reliable estimation of the thermodynamic lower critical field, as discussed below. It is worth noting that the superconducting hysteresis loops can still be measured at temperatures very close to T_{c} with only a weak magnetic background. This indicates that the sample contains negligible magnetic impurities. The bulk superconducting transition temperature T_{c}\approx 3.5 K as determined by specific-heat measurements [Fig. 2(c)] is significantly higher than T_{c}=1.27 and 0.92 K for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2}, respectively [11]. The jump height of the specific heat at  is found as \Delta C_{el}/T_{c}\approx 13.0 mJ/mol K^{2}. From our obtained \gamma_{n} (known as the Sommerfield coefficient in the normal state) = 5.9 mJ/mol K^{2} value, we estimate the universal parameter \Delta C_{el}/\gamma_{n}T_{c}=2.2, which is somewhat greater than the weak-coupling BCS prediction of 1.43 and indicates superconductivity in the strong-coupling regime. The excellent fit with an isotropic single-band s-wave alpha model [24] [Fig. 2(c)] suggests the conventional nature of a single band of superconductivity in BaPd_{2}As_{2}. From the relation of the Debye temperature, \theta_{D}=(12\pi^{4}R/S\beta)^{1/3}, where R is the molar gas constant and N=5 is the number of atoms per formula unit, we obtain \theta_{D}=144 K. Table 1 shows a comparison of the specific heat parameters of several AFe_{2}As_{2} compounds where A is a divalent atom and BaPd_{2}As_{2} system. Clearly, a strongly enhanced value \gamma_{n} is present for the heavily hole doped compound KFe_{2}As_{2} compared to other stoichiometric 122 compounds. However, several theoretical considerations, including two proposed modified Kadowaki-Woods relations [25, 26], as well as the observation of a significant linear in temperature residual term, point to a significantly smaller value of about 60 mJ/mol K^{2} for the Sommerfeld coefficient for the itinerant quasiparticles. This suggests that the strongly correlated heavy-fermion-like scenario suggested for KFe_{2}As_{2} in the literature should be revisited [18, 27]. On the other hand, the low values of \gamma_{n} for BaFe_{2}As_{2} and SrFe_{2}As_{2} are not surprising since large parts of its Fermi surface are gapped due to the well-known magnetic spin density wave (SDW) transition at high temperatures.

Figure 2(d) illustrates the temperature dependence of the in-plane electrical resistivity at ambient pressure. It exhibits a metallic behavior in the normal state followed by a sharp superconducting transition at T_{c}=3.8-3.85 K with \Delta T_{c}=0.15 K. The residual resistivity ratio (RRR) is found to be 18. The observations of a large RRR and a narrow SC transition again indicate a high quality of the samples investigated here. The inset of Fig. 2(d) shows an enlarged view at the superconducting transition which summarizes the T-dependent resistivity measured in various magnetic fields. Under a magnetic field the superconducting transition is shifted significantly to a lower temperature.

### _H-T_ phase diagram

The Cooper pairs are destroyed by the application of a high magnetic field either by orbital pair breaking due to the Lorentz force or by Pauli paramagnetic pair breaking via the Zeeman effect. Critical fields are one of the fundamental parameters that provide valuable information about the microscopic origin of pair breaking and reflect the electronic structure responsible for superconductivity. Figure 2(a) shows the isothermal magnetization of BaPd_{2}As_{2} measured at various in-plane magnetic field orientations (H\parallel ab) at different in-plane angles with respect to the crystalline axes. The data provides clear evidence that all data converges to the same upper critical field value, indicating that this system is isotropic in the ab plane. The isothermal magnetization for both H\parallel ab and H\parallel c axis is presented in Fig. 2(b), in which the upper critical field H_{c2} (field at which M=0) also converges to the same value. Note that the differences in the magnetization loops here are attributed to the demagnetization factor of the rather flat sample geometry.

In order to illustrate the upper critical field H_{c2}, we show the magnetic phase diagram in Fig. 3(a). The Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory predicts the behavior of H_{c2}(T_{c}), taking into account paramagnetic and orbital pair breaking [35]. The orbital limited field H_{c2}^{\rm orb} at zero temperature is determined by the slope at T_{c} as H_{c2}^{\rm orb}=0.69\ T_{c}\left(\partial\,H_{c2}/\partial\,T\right)|_{T_{c}}. Fit to the data in the entire measurement range for negligible spin-paramagnetic effects (\alpha=0) and spin-orbit scattering (\lambda=0) yields \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\rm orb}(B\parallel c)=0.18 T for both orientations. The most remarkable aspect of Fig. 3(a) is the fact that the upper critical field extrapolates to a similar zero-temperature value (0.18 T), irrespective of whether the field is applied parallel or perpendicular to the c axis. This is in contrast to the behavior of other quasi-two-dimensional superconductors [27, 36, 37], where the in-plane critical fields are many times larger than those for fields applied perpendicular to the quasi-two-dimensional planes.

To further study the anisotropy of the superconducting state, we have measured temperature dependence of the lower critical field, H_{c1} [see Fig. 3(b)]. The lower critical field H_{c1}(T), where the penetration of vortices in the sample becomes energetically favorable, and the magnetic penetration depth \lambda(T) are very useful parameters that provide important information about bulk thermodynamic properties. However, the determination of H_{c1} from magnetization data in not an easy task. These types of data are obtained by tracking the virgin M(H) curve in low fields at several temperatures. We have adopted a rigorous procedure (i.e., with a user-independent outcome) to determine the transition from linear to nonlinear M(H), that consists of calculating the regression coefficient R, see the inset of Fig. 3(a), of a linear fit to the data points collected between 0 and H, as a function of H[38, 39, 40]. In order to trust our extracted H_{c1} values, we determined the H_{c1} for some particular temperatures by measuring the onset of the trapped moment M_{t}, see the lower inset of Fig. 3(b). The trapped flux moment M_{t} is obtained by (i) warming the sample up to temperatures above T_{c}, then (ii) cooling the sample at zero field down to each particular temperature, subsequently (iii) the external magnetic field is increased to a certain maximum value H_{m}, and (iv) measure the remanent magnetization M_{t} after the applied field has been switched off. The field H_{m} at which M_{t} deviates from zero determines the H_{c1} value at the desired temperature. The so obtained values of H_{c1} are shown in Fig. 3(b) for H\parallel ab.

Although the low-temperature lower critical field is rather isotropic, the initial slope near T_{c} does show some dependence on the field orientation [Fig. 3(b)], perhaps resulting from details of the vortex structure, the Fermi-surface topology or different sample edge properties. H_{c1} clearly flattens off at low temperatures indicating that the superconducting energy gap becomes fully open. In the limit of T\approx 0 K, we acquired the value of H_{c1}=43\pm 2 Oe. From the measured upper critical magnetic field, we can estimate the effective coherence length \xi=\sqrt{\frac{\phi_{0}}{2\pi H_{c2}}} where \phi_{0} is the flux quantum, giving \xi=42.7\pm 0.5 nm. Exploiting the following expressions relating H_{c1} and H_{c2} derived by Brandt [41]: \frac{2H_{c1}(0)}{H_{c2}(0)}=\frac{\ln\pi+3(c)}{2\lambda^{2}}=\frac{\ln\pi+0.5} {\kappa^{2}} provides us with the effective Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa=0.62\pm 0.01 along with the effective penetration depth \lambda=\kappa\xi=26.4\pm 1 nm.

(b) Phase diagram of H_{c1} vs T for the field applied parallel to the c axis. H_{c1} has been estimated by two different methods—from the extrapolation of \sqrt{M_{t}}\to 0 (open symbols, see lower inset) and from the regression factor [closed symbols, see the inset of (a)]. The bars show the uncertainty of estimated by the deviating point of the regression fits and the linear fit of \sqrt{M_{t}}.

 

### Andreev reflections effect spectroscopy

In order to further test the superconductivity character in the investigated system, we performed multiple Andreev reflections effect spectroscopy. The latter is known to be a powerful tool for probing the superconducting energy gaps. Several adjustable SnS junctions were made using a break-junction (BJ) technique; for details of the BJ techniques, see, e.g., Refs. [42, 43, 44]. Firstly, the dI/dV curves for the junctions clearly demonstrate an enhanced conduction at zero bias, intrinsic to Andreev-type SnS junctions [see Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). Secondly, the dI/dV curves in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) show a series of sharp dips located at bias voltages V\propto 1/n with n=1,2,3. Several prepared contacts demonstrated similar spectra with up to three sharp dips [see Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)], whose positions were reproducible in various spectra within \approx0.05 meV.

For these reasons, we interpret the series of dips as the subharmonic gap structure, typical for the multiple Andreev reflection effect; correspondingly, we associate the gap positions V_{n} with 2\Delta /en [42, 43]. Having established this, we find \Delta = 0.80 meV from the spectra Fig. 4(a) and \Delta = 0.81 meV from Fig. 4(b). Temperature dependence of the Fig. 4(b) spectrum is shown in Fig. 3(c). As temperature increases, the voltage distance between the two strips in Fig. 4(c) shrinks, signifying gradual decay of the gap. The resulting temperature dependence of the energy gap, \Delta(T), is plotted in Fig. 4(d); it almost does not deviate from the single-band BCS-like curve. The gap vanishes to zero at a local T_{c} = 3.64 K, very close to that found from H_{c1}(T) and H_{c2}(T) measurements. By extrapolating \Delta(T) to zero temperature we obtain an estimate \Delta(0)\approx 0.85 meV, corresponding to characteristic BCS ratio 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}=5.4. This is rather close to the estimate 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}=4.76 obtained from the specific heat measurements [Fig. 2(c)], again indicating the strong coupling case.

### High-pressure studies

Another important result of our experiment is the effect of pressure on BaPd_{2}As_{2} system. Pressure has long been recognized as a fundamental thermodynamic variable, which is a convenient tool for deep understanding of various SC characteristics. It is considered as a clean way to tune basic electronic and structural properties without changing the stoichiometry. In 122 iron-based superconductors, it was found that T_{c} and the upper critical field of the parent undoped compound KFe_{2}As_{2}[45] have a V shaped dependence on pressure [46]. In BaFe_{2}As_{2}, a pressure-induced structural distortion occurs [47]. To investigate BaPd_{2}As_{2} under pressure, we performed AC susceptibility and electric transport experiments in a diamond anvil cell. In Fig. 5, we show data of the AC susceptibility [Fig. 5(a)] and the electrical resistivity [Fig. 5(b)], both of which show a gradual suppression of T_{c} with

 pressure, with excellent agreement between the two methods. The in-plane electrical resistivity at different pressures up to 11 GPa [Fig. 5(b)] shows that superconductivity is completely suppressed at 11 GPa. On the basis of the above results, we plotted a temperature-pressure phase diagram for BaPd_{2}As_{2} in the inset of Fig. 5(a). The linear decrease of T_{c} under pressure is the typical behavior found in classical superconductors, where phonon hardening is the most probable effect which usually reduces the critical temperature and ultimately completely suppresses it. In the following, we investigate whether this classical scenario holds here or whether there are other factors that regulate the T_{c} suppression.

In Fig. 6, we present the calculated electronic structures of BaPd_{2}As_{2} under various pressures (0, 5, and 10 GPa). The crystal structures under these pressures are fully optimized within the framework of DFT. In order to show that our calculations can reproduce the crystal structures, we compare our calculated parameters at 0 GPa with the experimental value in Ref. [12]. It is found that the calculated in-plane lattice constant at 0 GPa is just slightly underestimated by 1.7% as compared to the experimental value of 4.489 A. This indicates that our calculations can reproduce the crystal structures of BaPd_{2}As_{2} well. Figure 6(a) shows the total density of states of unit cell BaPd_{2}As_{2}, the region around the Fermi level is shown by the zoomed upper inset. The electronic states at the Fermi level decrease as pressure is increased; this decreasing is microscopically derived from the decrease of partial densities of states of Pd-4d and As-4p as presented in Fig. 6(b)). We compare the density of states of BaPd_{2}As_{2} with those in CaPd_{2}As_{2}, SrPd_{2}As_{2}, and the nonsuperconducting CeMg_{2}Si_{2}-type BaPd_{2}As_{2}[13, 14]. In all these compounds, the density of states located in the interval from -1 eV to the Fermi level mainly comes from the contributions of Pd-4d and As-4p orbitals. In addition, the contribution to the valence bands of A ions (Ba, Ca, and Sr) are negligible, indicating the interactions between A ions and -[PdAs_{2}]_{2} blocks are quite ionic. Although the electronic states at the Fermi level in superconducting BaPd_{2}As_{2} and nonsuperconducting CeMg_{2}Si_{2}-type BaPd_{2}As_{2} are both about two states/eV per formula unit, their topology of bands are different, which leads to significant difference of the topology of their Fermi surfaces. Figure 6(c) shows the 3D Fermi surfaces in the Brillouin zone under pressures of 0 and 5 GPa. The topology of 3D Fermi surfaces of BaPd_{2}As_{2} under P=0 is similar to those in isostructural CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2} where two electronlike and one quasi-2D holelike Fermi surface sheets are observed [13, 14]. Such a topology is distinguished from that in CeMg_{2}Si_{2}-type BaPd_{2}As_{2} where a large 3D holelike sheet and two electronlike sheets are formed in the center and corners of the Brillouin zone, respectively. For BaPd_{2}As_{2} in our study, a quasi-2D holelike Fermi surface is formed around the Z point at ambient pressure, but this Fermi surface sheet disappears when an external pressure is applied. Therefore, the observed suppression of T_{c} of BaPd_{2}As_{2} under pressures may also reflect the decrease of density of states at the Fermi level.

In order to semiquantitatively evaluate the change of T_{c} under pressures from first-principles study, we further carried out electron phonon coupling calculations, see Fig. 7. The standard approach of evaluating T_{c} is to solve the Eliashberg equation by introducing the energy cutoff and the pseudo-Coulomb potential, \mu^{*}[48]. Here, we adopt the convenient formula of T_{c} that approximates the Eliashberg equation developed by McMillan [49] and Allen-Dynes [50]. In the

  McMillan-Allen-Dynes formula, T_{c} is given as

\[T_{c} = \frac{\omega_{log}}{1.2}\exp\left( - \frac{1.04(1 + \lambda)}{\lambda - \mu^{*}(1 + 0.62\lambda)} \right).\]

Here, \mu^{*} is a pseudo-Coulomb potential, and the electron phonon coupling parameter \lambda and the logarithmic average phonon frequency \omega_{log} are defined as

\[\lambda = 2\int{d\omega\frac{\alpha^{2}F(\omega)}{\omega}},\]

\[\ln\omega_{log} = \frac{2}{\lambda}\int{d\omega\frac{\alpha^{2}F(\omega)}{\omega}}\ln(\omega)\]

with

The lattice parameters as a function of pressure is plotted in Figs. 8(b) and 8(c), where two discontinues can be seen at 12 GPa and 24.2 GPa, respectively, which suggests the lattice distortion with pressure. The V-P plot is fitted with a second-order Birch-Murmaghan equation of state (EOS), as shown in Fig. 8(d), which yielded a bulk modulus of B_{0}=40(6) GPa below 12 GPa and B_{0}=142(3) GPa below 24.2 GPa. However, the volume collapses above 27.2 GPa which may imply the phase transition. Therefore, these results suggest a subtle structural deformation below 12 GPa and 27.2 GPa. The disappearance of superconductivity at 11 GPa may be connected to the large lattice distortion after 12 GPa, when the compressibility changes dramatically which leads the lattice staying far away from initial structure configuration. As black lines are presented in Fig. 8(a), the upper patterns and lower ones as red lines for the data taken at increasing and decreasing pressure, respectively. These results show no symmetry change during pressurization.

## IV IV. Conclusion

In summary, as far as we are aware, no other iron-free layered pnictide superconductor exhibit upper and lower critical fields that behave in the same way as those of BaPd_{2}As_{2}. The difference, we believe, might be linked to this system distinctive Fermi-surface topology. The magnetization hysteresis loops in Fig. 2 appear to be not far from the borderline to a type-I superconductivity. The present results, (i) the T dependencies of both H_{c2} and H_{c1}, (ii) the isotropic single-band alpha model fit to the electronic specific heat, (iii) the large specific-heat jump at T_{c}, (iv) the small value of the effective Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa, (v) the BCS type temperature dependence of the superconducting energy gap extracted from Andreev reflection resonance, (vi) the linear decay of superconductivity under pressure, and (vii) complete pressure suppression of the superconductivity at 12 GPa due to the lattice deformation, all indicate a strong-coupling conventional isotropic superconductivity in the iron-free layered pnictide superconductor BaPd_{2}As_{2}. Such behavior differs significantly from all layered superconductors previously known, especially from the unconventional iron-based superconductors with various competing or coexisting electronic orders.

###### Abstract

While the layered 122 iron arsenide superconductors are highly anisotropic, unconventional, and exhibit several forms of electronic orders that coexist or compete with superconductivity in different regions of their phase diagrams, we find in the absence of iron in the structure that the superconducting characteristics of the end member BaPd_{2}As_{2} are surprisingly conventional. Here we report on complementary measurements of specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, resistivity measurements, Andreev spectroscopy, and synchrotron high pressure x-ray diffraction measurements supplemented with theoretical calculations for BaPd_{2}As_{2}. Its superconducting properties are completely isotropic as demonstrated by the critical fields, which do not depend on the direction of the applied field. Under the application of high pressure, T_{c} is linearly suppressed, which is the typical behavior of classical phonon-mediated superconductors with some additional effect of a pressure-induced decrease in the electronic density of states and the electron-phonon coupling parameters. Structural changes in the layered BaPd_{2}As_{2} have been studied by means of angle-dispersive diffraction in a diamond-anvil cell. At 12 GPa and 24.2 GPa we observed pressure induced lattice distortions manifesting as the discontinuity and, hence discontinuity in the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. The bulk modulus is B_{0}=40(6) GPa below 12 GPa and B_{0}=142(3) GPa below 27.2 GPa.

## I Introduction

In conventional superconductors, the electron-phonon interaction gives rise to the attraction between electrons near the Fermi surface with opposite momenta and opposite spins, which eventually causes superconductivity and conservation of the time-reversal symmetry [1]. The discovery of superconductivity up to 55 K in iron-based pnictides has been at the forefront of interest in the scientific community over the last few years [2, 3, 4, 5]. These materials have multiple Fermi pockets with electronlike and holelike dispersion of carriers. For the BaFe_{2}As_{2} (BFA) parent compound, the electron doping is induced by substitution of Ni, Co, Rh, and Pd at the Fe sites, which have more d electrons than Fe [6, 7, 8]. The parent compound BFA itself is not superconducting but features two forms of highly correlated electronic orders. One is the antiferromagnetic spin density wave (SDW) of stripe-type order in which chains of parallel spins are adjacent to chains with opposite spin direction [9]. In addition to this SDW order a spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry (nematic order) from a high-temperature tetragonal (C_{4}) symmetry to a low temperature orthorhombic structure occurs [9]. The nematic order is most likely due to an electronic instability that causes pronounced in-pane anisotropy of the Fe-As layers [10]. Upon doping, both forms of static orders coexist with superconductivity in a wide range of their phase diagram, and it is still unclear whether they are beneficial or competing with superconductivity. The compound BaPd_{2}As_{2} in the focus of this paper represents the end member of the Pd-doped series and exists in the form of two types of crystal structures: ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-structure type ({\it 14}/mmm) and CeMg_{2}Si_{2}-structure type ({\it P4}/mmm) [11, 12]. The former structure has bulk superconductivity with T_{c}=3.85 K, while in the latter structure only filamentary superconductivity was observed below 2 K. This shows that the crystal structure has a predominant effect on the superconducting properties of these systems [13, 14, 15]. Given that Fe likely has a leading effect on the high  temperature superconductivity in doped BFA, the effect of partial substitution of Fe on superconducting properties in general and on their anisotropy evolution remains unaddressed. The heavily hole-doped compounds differ from their optimally doped counterparts by the presence of particularly strong electronic correlations [16], which is seen in their substantially larger reported mass enhancements compared to those of the optimally doped compounds. For instance, it is well established that CaFe_{2}As_{2} is less correlated than KFe_{2}As_{2} at ambient pressure [17, 18]. Therefore, it is necessary to deeper investigate the evolution of physical properties of the BFA system under various doping, including end members of the 122 family with fully substituted Ba, Fe, and As.

In particular, due to the lack of systematic experiments, a comprehensive and complete picture on the iron-free layered pnictide superconductor BaPd_{2}As_{2} is still lacking. Here, we performed thermodynamic, transport, magnetotransport, local spectroscopy measurements, and first principle calculations in order to unravel the nature of the superconductivity in the BaPd_{2}As_{2} system. Specifically, we examined the electronic properties of BaPd_{2}As_{2} single crystal using a combination of specific heat (down to 400 mK), magnetic susceptibility, resistivity measurements (down to 400 mK and under pressure up to 11 GPa), Andreev reflection spectroscopy (down to 1.4 K), and first-principles calculations. We found that BaPd_{2}As_{2} as the end member of the substituted series of BaFe_{2-x}Pd_{x}As_{2} appears to behave surprisingly different from the parent compound BaFe_{2}As_{2}. While highly unconventional superconductivity can be induced by doping or application of pressure in BaFe_{2}As_{2}, the end member BaPd_{2}As_{2} in which all iron is completely replaced by Pd, appears to be a very conventional classical s-wave superconductor most probable, with phonon-mediated pairing. All Fe-based 122 superconductor materials are layered compounds and are expected to show highly anisotropic superconducting parameters. While such anisotropy is indeed found in the iron based superconductors, the superconducting properties of BaPd_{2}As_{2} are isotropic. This demonstrates the important role of the iron in the iron-based superconductors, which causes all the unconventional effects, including the competing or coexisting orders such as spin density waves and nematic orders, that appear to be completely absent in BaPd_{2}As_{2}.

## II Experimental

Single crystals of ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type BaPd_{2}As_{2} were successfully prepared by a self-flux method, details for the growth process and sample characterization were published elsewhere [12]. Low temperature transport and specific heat (down to 400 mK) were measured with a physical property measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design). Four contacts were used to measure the high-pressure in-plane resistivity with the superconductor BaPd_{2}As_{2} set in a diamond anvils cell in the PPMS-9 T. A single crystal was loaded in the sample space formed by c-BN gasket of around 130 \mum in diameter. We used an insulating gasket made of the mixture of cubic boron nitride with epoxy. Daphne oil 7373 was used as a pressure medium. Pressure was calibrated by using several ruby chips with dimensions of about 1 \mum that were placed into the cell along with the sample at room temperature [19]. Four Pt leads with thickness of about 1 \mum and the width of about 7-12 \mum were used for 4-probe measurements. The DC magnetization was measured in the Quantum Design SQUID VSM magnetometer with magnetic fields applied parallel and perpendicular to the ab plane. For the parallel field configuration the sample was attached with vacuum grease to a quartz sample holder, which allowed us to rotate the sample at room temperature in the grease so that different in-plane field orientations could be realized. AC magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed with an AC field at a frequency of 10 Hz and amplitude of 3.86 Oe over the pressure range of 0-5 GPa in a commercial SQUID magnetometer. Pressure was attained by a miniature diamond anvil cell (DAC) which was designed to be inserted into the SQUID magnetometer [20]. In the sample chamber, the crystals were immersed into a pressure transmitting medium, Apiezon J oil, together with a piece of ruby as the manometer. Pressure calibration was performed using the ruby fluorescence method at room temperature [19]. Multiple Andreev reflection effect (MARE) spectroscopy of superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SnS) junctions was performed using the break-junction technique [21, 22]. MARE occurs in the ballistic regime of SnS junctions and causes excess current at low bias voltages (so-called foot) and a subharmonic gap structure. This structure consists of a series of dips in dynamic conductance, each dip corresponding to voltage values V_{n}=2\Delta/en, where \Delta is the superconducting gap, e is the elementary charge, and n=1, 2,...is the subharmonic order. First-principles calculations are performed with plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) implemented in Quantum Espresso [23]. The _in situ_ high-pressure x-ray diffraction(\lambda=0.4066 A) measurement was performed with an angle-dispersive synchrotron x-ray diffraction mode (ADXRD) at beamline 16 IDB of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The as-prepared single crystal sample was crushed to powder and loaded into a gasketed diamond anvil cell (DAC) with silicon oil as a pressure-transmitting medium up to 30.3 GPa.

## III Results and Discussion

### Thermodynamic studies

The isothermal magnetization M vs H loops H\|ab and H\|c at different temperatures up to 3.75 K is shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively. The fact that the hysteresis loops for both orientations are point symmetric at the origin points to relatively weak surface barriers, and thus is indicative of bulk pinning [Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)]. This consideration applies to all data up to T_{c} and ensures that vortex penetration occurs at a field near the lower critical field, H_{c1}. In contrast, when surface barriers were predominant, the first vortex entrance would take place at much higher field (\approxH_{c}). This is a very important point to obtain reliable estimation of the thermodynamic lower critical field, as discussed below. It is worth noting that the superconducting hysteresis loops can still be measured at temperatures very close to T_{c} with only a weak magnetic background. This indicates that the sample contains negligible magnetic impurities. The bulk superconducting transition temperature T_{c}\approx 3.5 K as determined by specific-heat measurements [Fig. 2(c)] is significantly higher than T_{c}=1.27 and 0.92 K for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2}, respectively [11]. The jump height of the specific heat at  is found as \Delta C_{el}/T_{c}\approx 13.0 mJ/mol K^{2}. From our obtained \gamma_{n} (known as the Sommerfield coefficient in the normal state) = 5.9 mJ/mol K^{2} value, we estimate the universal parameter \Delta C_{el}/\gamma_{n}T_{c}=2.2, which is somewhat greater than the weak-coupling BCS prediction of 1.43 and indicates superconductivity in the strong-coupling regime. The excellent fit with an isotropic single-band s-wave alpha model [24] [Fig. 2(c)] suggests the conventional nature of a single band of superconductivity in BaPd_{2}As_{2}. From the relation of the Debye temperature, \theta_{D}=(12\pi^{4}R/S\beta)^{1/3}, where R is the molar gas constant and N=5 is the number of atoms per formula unit, we obtain \theta_{D}=144 K. Table 1 shows a comparison of the specific heat parameters of several AFe_{2}As_{2} compounds where A is a divalent atom and BaPd_{2}As_{2} system. Clearly, a strongly enhanced value \gamma_{n} is present for the heavily hole doped compound KFe_{2}As_{2} compared to other stoichiometric 122 compounds. However, several theoretical considerations, including two proposed modified Kadowaki-Woods relations [25, 26], as well as the observation of a significant linear in temperature residual term, point to a significantly smaller value of about 60 mJ/mol K^{2} for the Sommerfeld coefficient for the itinerant quasiparticles. This suggests that the strongly correlated heavy-fermion-like scenario suggested for KFe_{2}As_{2} in the literature should be revisited [18, 27]. On the other hand, the low values of \gamma_{n} for BaFe_{2}As_{2} and SrFe_{2}As_{2} are not surprising since large parts of its Fermi surface are gapped due to the well-known magnetic spin density wave (SDW) transition at high temperatures.

Figure 2(d) illustrates the temperature dependence of the in-plane electrical resistivity at ambient pressure. It exhibits a metallic behavior in the normal state followed by a sharp superconducting transition at T_{c}=3.8-3.85 K with \Delta T_{c}=0.15 K. The residual resistivity ratio (RRR) is found to be 18. The observations of a large RRR and a narrow SC transition again indicate a high quality of the samples investigated here. The inset of Fig. 2(d) shows an enlarged view at the superconducting transition which summarizes the T-dependent resistivity measured in various magnetic fields. Under a magnetic field the superconducting transition is shifted significantly to a lower temperature.

### _H-T_ phase diagram

The Cooper pairs are destroyed by the application of a high magnetic field either by orbital pair breaking due to the Lorentz force or by Pauli paramagnetic pair breaking via the Zeeman effect. Critical fields are one of the fundamental parameters that provide valuable information about the microscopic origin of pair breaking and reflect the electronic structure responsible for superconductivity. Figure 2(a) shows the isothermal magnetization of BaPd_{2}As_{2} measured at various in-plane magnetic field orientations (H\parallel ab) at different in-plane angles with respect to the crystalline axes. The data provides clear evidence that all data converges to the same upper critical field value, indicating that this system is isotropic in the ab plane. The isothermal magnetization for both H\parallel ab and H\parallel c axis is presented in Fig. 2(b), in which the upper critical field H_{c2} (field at which M=0) also converges to the same value. Note that the differences in the magnetization loops here are attributed to the demagnetization factor of the rather flat sample geometry.

In order to illustrate the upper critical field H_{c2}, we show the magnetic phase diagram in Fig. 3(a). The Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory predicts the behavior of H_{c2}(T_{c}), taking into account paramagnetic and orbital pair breaking [35]. The orbital limited field H_{c2}^{\rm orb} at zero temperature is determined by the slope at T_{c} as H_{c2}^{\rm orb}=0.69\ T_{c}\left(\partial\,H_{c2}/\partial\,T\right)|_{T_{c}}. Fit to the data in the entire measurement range for negligible spin-paramagnetic effects (\alpha=0) and spin-orbit scattering (\lambda=0) yields \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\rm orb}(B\parallel c)=0.18 T for both orientations. The most remarkable aspect of Fig. 3(a) is the fact that the upper critical field extrapolates to a similar zero-temperature value (0.18 T), irrespective of whether the field is applied parallel or perpendicular to the c axis. This is in contrast to the behavior of other quasi-two-dimensional superconductors [27, 36, 37], where the in-plane critical fields are many times larger than those for fields applied perpendicular to the quasi-two-dimensional planes.

To further study the anisotropy of the superconducting state, we have measured temperature dependence of the lower critical field, H_{c1} [see Fig. 3(b)]. The lower critical field H_{c1}(T), where the penetration of vortices in the sample becomes energetically favorable, and the magnetic penetration depth \lambda(T) are very useful parameters that provide important information about bulk thermodynamic properties. However, the determination of H_{c1} from magnetization data in not an easy task. These types of data are obtained by tracking the virgin M(H) curve in low fields at several temperatures. We have adopted a rigorous procedure (i.e., with a user-independent outcome) to determine the transition from linear to nonlinear M(H), that consists of calculating the regression coefficient R, see the inset of Fig. 3(a), of a linear fit to the data points collected between 0 and H, as a function of H[38, 39, 40]. In order to trust our extracted H_{c1} values, we determined the H_{c1} for some particular temperatures by measuring the onset of the trapped moment M_{t}, see the lower inset of Fig. 3(b). The trapped flux moment M_{t} is obtained by (i) warming the sample up to temperatures above T_{c}, then (ii) cooling the sample at zero field down to each particular temperature, subsequently (iii) the external magnetic field is increased to a certain maximum value H_{m}, and (iv) measure the remanent magnetization M_{t} after the applied field has been switched off. The field H_{m} at which M_{t} deviates from zero determines the H_{c1} value at the desired temperature. The so obtained values of H_{c1} are shown in Fig. 3(b) for H\parallel ab.

Although the low-temperature lower critical field is rather isotropic, the initial slope near T_{c} does show some dependence on the field orientation [Fig. 3(b)], perhaps resulting from details of the vortex structure, the Fermi-surface topology or different sample edge properties. H_{c1} clearly flattens off at low temperatures indicating that the superconducting energy gap becomes fully open. In the limit of T\approx 0 K, we acquired the value of H_{c1}=43\pm 2 Oe. From the measured upper critical magnetic field, we can estimate the effective coherence length \xi=\sqrt{\frac{\phi_{0}}{2\pi H_{c2}}} where \phi_{0} is the flux quantum, giving \xi=42.7\pm 0.5 nm. Exploiting the following expressions relating H_{c1} and H_{c2} derived by Brandt [41]: \frac{2H_{c1}(0)}{H_{c2}(0)}=\frac{\ln\pi+3(c)}{2\lambda^{2}}=\frac{\ln\pi+0.5} {\kappa^{2}} provides us with the effective Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa=0.62\pm 0.01 along with the effective penetration depth \lambda=\kappa\xi=26.4\pm 1 nm.

(b) Phase diagram of H_{c1} vs T for the field applied parallel to the c axis. H_{c1} has been estimated by two different methods—from the extrapolation of \sqrt{M_{t}}\to 0 (open symbols, see lower inset) and from the regression factor [closed symbols, see the inset of (a)]. The bars show the uncertainty of estimated by the deviating point of the regression fits and the linear fit of \sqrt{M_{t}}.

 

### Andreev reflections effect spectroscopy

In order to further test the superconductivity character in the investigated system, we performed multiple Andreev reflections effect spectroscopy. The latter is known to be a powerful tool for probing the superconducting energy gaps. Several adjustable SnS junctions were made using a break-junction (BJ) technique; for details of the BJ techniques, see, e.g., Refs. [42, 43, 44]. Firstly, the dI/dV curves for the junctions clearly demonstrate an enhanced conduction at zero bias, intrinsic to Andreev-type SnS junctions [see Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). Secondly, the dI/dV curves in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) show a series of sharp dips located at bias voltages V\propto 1/n with n=1,2,3. Several prepared contacts demonstrated similar spectra with up to three sharp dips [see Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)], whose positions were reproducible in various spectra within \approx0.05 meV.

For these reasons, we interpret the series of dips as the subharmonic gap structure, typical for the multiple Andreev reflection effect; correspondingly, we associate the gap positions V_{n} with 2\Delta /en [42, 43]. Having established this, we find \Delta = 0.80 meV from the spectra Fig. 4(a) and \Delta = 0.81 meV from Fig. 4(b). Temperature dependence of the Fig. 4(b) spectrum is shown in Fig. 3(c). As temperature increases, the voltage distance between the two strips in Fig. 4(c) shrinks, signifying gradual decay of the gap. The resulting temperature dependence of the energy gap, \Delta(T), is plotted in Fig. 4(d); it almost does not deviate from the single-band BCS-like curve. The gap vanishes to zero at a local T_{c} = 3.64 K, very close to that found from H_{c1}(T) and H_{c2}(T) measurements. By extrapolating \Delta(T) to zero temperature we obtain an estimate \Delta(0)\approx 0.85 meV, corresponding to characteristic BCS ratio 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}=5.4. This is rather close to the estimate 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}=4.76 obtained from the specific heat measurements [Fig. 2(c)], again indicating the strong coupling case.

### High-pressure studies

Another important result of our experiment is the effect of pressure on BaPd_{2}As_{2} system. Pressure has long been recognized as a fundamental thermodynamic variable, which is a convenient tool for deep understanding of various SC characteristics. It is considered as a clean way to tune basic electronic and structural properties without changing the stoichiometry. In 122 iron-based superconductors, it was found that T_{c} and the upper critical field of the parent undoped compound KFe_{2}As_{2}[45] have a V shaped dependence on pressure [46]. In BaFe_{2}As_{2}, a pressure-induced structural distortion occurs [47]. To investigate BaPd_{2}As_{2} under pressure, we performed AC susceptibility and electric transport experiments in a diamond anvil cell. In Fig. 5, we show data of the AC susceptibility [Fig. 5(a)] and the electrical resistivity [Fig. 5(b)], both of which show a gradual suppression of T_{c} with

(b) Dynamic conductance spectrum with two Andreev reflections at T = 1.63 K. Vertical green lines in panels (a) and (b) depict the dip positions. (c) Temperature evolution of conductance from the latter junction. (d) Temperature dependence of the obtained superconducting gap. Solid line shows a BCS-like curve for \delta.

 pressure, with excellent agreement between the two methods. The in-plane electrical resistivity at different pressures up to 11 GPa [Fig. 5(b)] shows that superconductivity is completely suppressed at 11 GPa. On the basis of the above results, we plotted a temperature-pressure phase diagram for BaPd_{2}As_{2} in the inset of Fig. 5(a). The linear decrease of T_{c} under pressure is the typical behavior found in classical superconductors, where phonon hardening is the most probable effect which usually reduces the critical temperature and ultimately completely suppresses it. In the following, we investigate whether this classical scenario holds here or whether there are other factors that regulate the T_{c} suppression.

In Fig. 6, we present the calculated electronic structures of BaPd_{2}As_{2} under various pressures (0, 5, and 10 GPa). The crystal structures under these pressures are fully optimized within the framework of DFT. In order to show that our calculations can reproduce the crystal structures, we compare our calculated parameters at 0 GPa with the experimental value in Ref. [12]. It is found that the calculated in-plane lattice constant at 0 GPa is just slightly underestimated by 1.7% as compared to the experimental value of 4.489 A. This indicates that our calculations can reproduce the crystal structures of BaPd_{2}As_{2} well. Figure 6(a) shows the total density of states of unit cell BaPd_{2}As_{2}, the region around the Fermi level is shown by the zoomed upper inset. The electronic states at the Fermi level decrease as pressure is increased; this decreasing is microscopically derived from the decrease of partial densities of states of Pd-4d and As-4p as presented in Fig. 6(b)). We compare the density of states of BaPd_{2}As_{2} with those in CaPd_{2}As_{2}, SrPd_{2}As_{2}, and the nonsuperconducting CeMg_{2}Si_{2}-type BaPd_{2}As_{2}[13, 14]. In all these compounds, the density of states located in the interval from -1 eV to the Fermi level mainly comes from the contributions of Pd-4d and As-4p orbitals. In addition, the contribution to the valence bands of A ions (Ba, Ca, and Sr) are negligible, indicating the interactions between A ions and -[PdAs_{2}]_{2} blocks are quite ionic. Although the electronic states at the Fermi level in superconducting BaPd_{2}As_{2} and nonsuperconducting CeMg_{2}Si_{2}-type BaPd_{2}As_{2} are both about two states/eV per formula unit, their topology of bands are different, which leads to significant difference of the topology of their Fermi surfaces. Figure 6(c) shows the 3D Fermi surfaces in the Brillouin zone under pressures of 0 and 5 GPa. The topology of 3D Fermi surfaces of BaPd_{2}As_{2} under P=0 is similar to those in isostructural CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2} where two electronlike and one quasi-2D holelike Fermi surface sheets are observed [13, 14]. Such a topology is distinguished from that in CeMg_{2}Si_{2}-type BaPd_{2}As_{2} where a large 3D holelike sheet and two electronlike sheets are formed in the center and corners of the Brillouin zone, respectively. For BaPd_{2}As_{2} in our study, a quasi-2D holelike Fermi surface is formed around the Z point at ambient pressure, but this Fermi surface sheet disappears when an external pressure is applied. Therefore, the observed suppression of T_{c} of BaPd_{2}As_{2} under pressures may also reflect the decrease of density of states at the Fermi level.

In order to semiquantitatively evaluate the change of T_{c} under pressures from first-principles study, we further carried out electron phonon coupling calculations, see Fig. 7. The standard approach of evaluating T_{c} is to solve the Eliashberg equation by introducing the energy cutoff and the pseudo-Coulomb potential, \mu^{*}[48]. Here, we adopt the convenient formula of T_{c} that approximates the Eliashberg equation developed by McMillan [49] and Allen-Dynes [50]. In the

  McMillan-Allen-Dynes formula, T_{c} is given as

\[T_{c} = \frac{\omega_{log}}{1.2}\exp\left( - \frac{1.04(1 + \lambda)}{\lambda - \mu^{*}(1 + 0.62\lambda)} \right).\]

Here, \mu^{*} is a pseudo-Coulomb potential, and the electron phonon coupling parameter \lambda and the logarithmic average phonon frequency \omega_{log} are defined as

\[\lambda = 2\int{d\omega\frac{\alpha^{2}F(\omega)}{\omega}},\]

\[\ln\omega_{log} = \frac{2}{\lambda}\int{d\omega\frac{\alpha^{2}F(\omega)}{\omega}}\ln(\omega)\]

with

\[\alpha^{2}F(\omega) = \frac{1}{N(0)}\sum\limits_{n\&n,\omega,v}{\left|g_{n\&n+q}^{v} \right|^{2}}\delta(\xi_{n\&q})\delta(\xi_{m\&q})\delta(\omega -\omega_  refined lattice parameters a=4.474(2) A, c=10.331(5) A, and V=206.83(4) A^{3} are slightly smaller than those at ambient conditions [12]. The lattice parameters as a function of pressure is plotted in Figs. 8(b) and 8(c), where two discontinues can be seen at 12 GPa and 24.2 GPa, respectively, which suggests the lattice distortion with pressure. The V-P plot is fitted with a second-order Birch-Murmaghan equation of state (EOS), as shown in Fig. 8(d), which yielded a bulk modulus of B_{0}=40(6) GPa below 12 GPa and B_{0}=142(3) GPa below 24.2 GPa. However, the volume collapses above 27.2 GPa which may imply the phase transition. Therefore, these results suggest a subtle structural deformation below 12 GPa and 27.2 GPa. The disappearance of superconductivity at 11 GPa may be connected to the large lattice distortion after 12 GPa, when the compressibility changes dramatically which leads the lattice staying far away from initial structure configuration. As black lines are presented in Fig. 8(a), the upper patterns and lower ones as red lines for the data taken at increasing and decreasing pressure, respectively. These results show no symmetry change during pressurization.

## IV IV. Conclusion

In summary, as far as we are aware, no other iron-free layered pnictide superconductor exhibit upper and lower critical fields that behave in the same way as those of BaPd_{2}As_{2}. The difference, we believe, might be linked to this system distinctive Fermi-surface topology. The magnetization hysteresis loops in Fig. 2 appear to be not far from the borderline to a type-I superconductivity. The present results, (i) the T dependencies of both H_{c2} and H_{c1}, (ii) the isotropic single-band alpha model fit to the electronic specific heat, (iii) the large specific-heat jump at T_{c}, (iv) the small value of the effective Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa, (v) the BCS type temperature dependence of the superconducting energy gap extracted from Andreev reflection resonance, (vi) the linear decay of superconductivity under pressure, and (vii) complete pressure suppression of the superconductivity at 12 GPa due to the lattice deformation, all indicate a strong-coupling conventional isotropic superconductivity in the iron-free layered pnictide superconductor BaPd_{2}As_{2}. Such behavior differs significantly from all layered superconductors previously known, especially from the unconventional iron-based superconductors with various competing or coexisting electronic orders.
