###### Abstract

We report magnetoresistance measurements of layered superconductor ZrNCl0.? at high magnetic fields (H) as high as 27 T and temperatures (T) as low as 0.5 K. The T dependence of the upper critical field H_{c2}(T) for H\leqc and H\leqc was obtained. H_{c2}(T) starts to increase with a gentle slope near T_{c}(0) followed by a steep slope with decreasing T, implying the dimensional crossover of the interplane coherence length from three dimensional to two dimensional (2D). The H_{c2}(T) is found to be anisotropic for the field direction, where the slope of H_{c2}^{\prime}=(dH_{c2}/dT) near H\approx 1 T can be estimated as H_{c2}^{+\frac{1}{2}}\sim -22.1 kOe/K and H_{c2}^{\prime 1}\approx\rightarrow4.9 kOe/K for H\leqc and H\leqc, respectively. The obtained anisotropy parameter \gamma\approx4.5 gives evidence for the 2D characteristic of the superconducting state in ZrNCl0.?

Layer-structured \beta-MNCl (M = Hf, Zr), which is an insulator having a band gap of \sim4.3-5 eV, was found to change into a superconductor with a small amount of alkali intercalation.^{1} The highest superconducting transition temperature, T_{c}\sim 25.5 K, was recorded for Li0.48(THF),HfNCl (THF; tetrahydrofuran C_{4}H_{8}O). Recently, Zhu and co-workers found that an insulating \beta-MNCl becomes superconducting through partial deintercalation of the chlorine layers.^{3} These systems have layered structure stacking of Cl-[MN]-[NM]-Cl slabs along the c axis perpendicular to the slab.^{2} Recent experimental^{4,5} and theoretical studies^{6,-8} have demonstrated a two-dimensional (2D) electronic state for which the superconductivity is derived from the 2D double [MN] honeycomb network. An unusual superconducting mechanism has been suggested^{9,-12} Ito _et al._ claimed that the 2D superfluid density n_{s,22}/m_{ab}^{3} (superconducting carrier density/effective mass) is a dominant determining factor for the high T_{c} in MNCl superconductors from \mu SR results.^{13}

The anisotropy of the upper critical field H_{c2}(T) was first reported for Li-doped HfNCl.^{4} However, lack of experimental data renders it impossible to discuss the T dependence of H_{c2} at T\rightarrow 0. Furthermore, T_{c}=25.5 K for Li-doped HfNCl is too high to determine the whole H_{c2} versus T phase. Recently, Ito _et al._ reported that the anisotropy ratio of H_{c2} for H\leqc (H_{c2}^{+}) to that for H\midc (H_{c2}^{+}) in Li0.17ZrNCl is roughly 3 (Ref. [13]). The entire H_{c2} versus T phase, however, has not been put forth yet. Together with results of Li-HfNCl (Refs. [4; 9]), the characteristics of the 2D superconducting state are believed to be important for the electron-doped MNCl system. Further measurements are required to clarify the intriguing superconducting properties in MNCl superconductors. In this sense, the studies of ZrNCl0.7 or Li,ZrNCl having lower T_{c}\sim 13 K might allow us to cover the whole H_{c2} versus T phase diagram, thereby bringing about intrinsic behavior of the quasi-2D superconductors. For those reasons, this study is intended to determine the H_{c2} versus T phase diagram for Cl-deintercalated \beta-ZrNCl (ZrNCl0.7) with T_{c}\sim 13 K.

Details of sample preparation and characterization for ZrNCl0.7 have been reported elsewhere.^{14} The powder sample was pressed into pellet form to orient ZrN planes (_ab_ plane) under 1.5 kbar (150 MPa) in argon atmosphere.^{4} Four oriented pellets, Nos. 1-4 were thus prepared. X-ray rocking curve measurements revealed that the _ab_ plane of the crystals were oriented in the pellets with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of less than 7^{\circ}. Resittivity measurements were carried out using a four probe dc/ac method in the T range of 0.5-300 K. Here, the samples were treated carefully in a glove box with high-purity He gas. The current and voltage leads were connected to the sample using silver paste with a toluene solvent; then they were covered with epoxy (stycast 1266) to prevent their degradation by exposure to moisture and oxygen. A magnetic field was provided by a conventional solenoid-type superconducting magnet in the field range of H=0-15 T, and by a hybrid magnet up to H=27 T at the High Field Laboratory for superconducting materials, IMR, Tohoku University. We also confirmed magnetization characteristics at various fields up to 5 T. Magnetic measurements showed that the substantial diamagnetic signals become apparent as the magnetic field increases above 1 T (not shown). These features are qualitatively identical to those for Li-HfNCl reported previously,^{4} in which the lowest-Landau-level (LLL) scaling analysis for the 2D superconducting fluctuations was adopted.^{15}

Figure 1 shows typical interplane resistivity \rho_{c} for the current direction of \midc (hereafter denoted as I_{c}) for sample No. 4 and in-plane resistivity \rho_{ab} for I\perpc (hereafter denoted as I_{ab}) for sample No. 2. The negative slope of resistivity d\rho(T)/dT< 0 was observed in the normal state near T_{c}. Similar behavior of the T dependence of resistivity was observed previously in Li0.17ZrNCl by Ito _et al._;^{13} that study indicated that d\rho(T)/dT< 0 is not intrinsic, but rather extrinsic because of grain boundaries. Actually, d\rho(T)/dT< 0 of the present ZrNCl_{0.7} depends strongly on the sample, but T_{c} hardly depends on it.

The remarkable feature in \rho(T) is that the interplane resistivity \rho_{c}(T) is about one hundred times larger than the in-plane resistivity \rho_{ab}(T), i.e., \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\!=\!10^{2}, but it is difficult to evaluate the absolute value of \rho_{c} accurately because of experimental problems including the terminal connection for the fragile pellet, anaerobic character, and misalignment effects. This feature indicates that the charge transfer between the layers is weak, being consistent with the 2D character of the electronic structure.[4, 5, 6, 7, 8] Similar but more pronounced anisotropy of resistivity has been reported for layered organic superconductors, e.g., \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\!\approx\!10^{3} in \kappa-(BEDT-TTF)_{2}Cu[N(CN)_{2}]Br. (Ref. [16]).

Figure 2 depicts the field-angle dependence of the resistivity at H\!\!=\!\!8 T and T\!\!=\!\!8 K. A clear but broad dip of the resistivity was observed for sample No. 2, reflecting the anisotropy of the superconducting state. Similar behavior was observed in other samples. Such broad dips indicate a considerably misaligned orientation. Although the x-ray rocking curve measurement indicated the highly oriented characteristic of the sample, it might overestimate the grain alignment in this pellet.

The T dependence of the resistivity under different magnetic fields with H\!\!\perp\!c and H\!\!\perp\!c is shown in Fig. 3. As mentioned previously, the observed superconducting transition for H\!\!\perp\!c might be broadened by both the grain boundaries and misalignment effects. On the other hand, we note here that, for H\!\!\parallel\!c, the respective broadenings of the resistive transitions are more remarkable than that for H\!\!\perp\!c; substantial suppression of T_{c}(H) is observed. These features are consistent with results of magnetization measurements near T_{c}. Such broadening of the superconducting transitions in resistivity and magnetization for H\!\!\parallel\!c is typical of low- dimensional superconductors. It is a natural consequence of the existence of superconducting fluctuations.[4, 15]

Figure 4 shows magnetoresistance for H\!\!\perp\!c and fields up to 27 T at different temperatures from T\!\!=\!\!13 to 0.5 K. The dashed line in the figure is the line expected from the linear extrapolation of the normal-state resistivity in Fig. 3(a). As mentioned in the previous text, the broad resistive transitions might be ascribed to both the grain boundaries and misalignment effects.

The T dependence of the H_{c2}(T) for H\!\!\perp\!c and H\!\!\parallel\!c is illustrated in Fig. 5. Here, T_{c} is tentatively defined by an 80% level of the normal-state resistivity because the broad resistive transitions prevent the exact determination of T_{c}(H). For that reason, the zero-field transition temperature, T_{c}(0), can be estimated as T_{c}(0)\!\approx\!12.8 K. Results showed that H_{c2}(T) starts to increase with a gentle slope near T_{c}(0) followed by a steep one with decreasing T. Such distinct behavior has been observed in other layered superconductors and is ascribable to the dimensional crossover from three

  dimensional (3D) to 2D caused by T dependence of the coherence length \xi(T). Under high magnetic fields that are stronger than 1 T, the slope H_{c2}^{\prime}=(dH_{c2}/dT) yields a value of H_{c2}^{\prime+}=-22.1 kOe/K and H_{c2}^{\prime-}=-4.9 kOe/K, respectively. The value of H_{c2}^{\prime}(0) is expected to be less than \approx7 T, and is consistent with previous results by Ito _et al._[13]

In general for layered superconductors, either the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model [17] or the 2D Lawrence-Doniach (LD) model [18] can be utilized, depending on the interlayer interaction in which the crossover from the LD to the GL regimes occurs at the boundary condition of \xi_{c}=dI\sqrt{2} with interlayer spacing d. The anisotropy parameter \gamma of the anisotropic GL model can be estimated as \gamma=H_{c2}^{\perp}/H_{c2}^{\parallel}= 4.5, which is direct evidence for quasi-2D aspects of the superconducting state. The GL coherence length \xi is calculated as \xi_{ab}= 71 A and \xi_{c}= 16 A, using relations -H_{c2}^{\perp}T_{c}=\phi_{0}/(2\pi\xi_{ab}^{\perp})T_{c} and \gamma=\xi_{ab}/\xi_{c} (Ref. [17]).

We next compare with Li-doped HfNCl homologue. In Li-HfNCl, \xi_{c}= 15.9 A is shorter than d\approx 19 A, indicating Josephson coupling between the adjacent layers. [4] In addition, ^{7}Li, ^{39}Cl, and ^{15}N NMR Knight-shift studies clarified that superconductivity is derived from the HfN layer. [4, 9, 10] It is noteworthy that \gamma= 4.5 for ZrNCl is larger than \Gamma= 3.7 for the Li-HfNCl homologue. [4] Within the framework of the anisotropic GL model, we expect \gamma(ZrNCl) <\gamma(Li-HfNCl) using the relations of d(ZrNCl) <d(Li-HfNCl) and \xi_{c}(ZrNCl) \sim\xi_{c}(Li-HfNCl). [4] On the other hand, the experimental result, \gamma(ZrNCl) >\gamma(Li-HfNCl), implies that the superconductivity of MNCl is independent of the interlayer spacing. Actually, the \muSR studies for a Li-doped ZrNCl system by Ito _et al._[13] also demonstrated that T_{c}, \xi_{ab} and n_{x}/m^{*} are independent of the interlayer distance, suggesting a highly 2D character of the superconductivity in MNCl. As mentioned previously, both the grain boundaries and misalignment effects are inevitable in the present sample, where misalignment by several degrees would lower the measured H_{c2}(0) by several tesla. [19] If the upturn of the H_{c2}(2) curve in the vicinity of H=0 is attributable to the 3D-2D crossover, a more realistic value of \xi_{c} of ZrNCl_{0.7} would be several angstrom; the estimated H_{c2}^{\perp}\sim 27 T might be underestimated, implying that \gamma>4.5.

We found that the observed H_{c2}^{\perp}(T) decreases linearly as T_{c}-T at T\rightarrow 0. The Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory predicts that H_{c2}(T) at T\rightarrow 0 K is fundamentally determined by the initial slope of the H_{c2} versus T curve, but is suppressed as H_{c2,0}=a(-dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}}T_{c} (a=0.73 for clean limit; a=0.69 for dirty limit) by the orbital pair-breaking effect. [20, 21] Furthermore, for spin-singlet superconductors, H_{c2} is suppressed by the Pauli paramagnetic pair-breaking limit defined by H_{p}=\Delta/\sqrt{2}\mu_{0}, where \Delta and \mu_{0} are the superconducting energy gap and the magnetic moment of electrons. [22, 23, 24]

If we apply the WHH theory for the clean limit case to H_{c2}^{\perp} of the present system, H_{c2,0}(0) can be estimated as =18.4 kOe using H_{c2}^{\prime\perp}=-22.1 kOe/K. We can also estimate the BCS Pauli limit as H_{p}= 23.5 T with T_{c}=12.8 K and \Delta= 3.5k_{B}T_{c}. The solid line in Fig. 5 is the theoretical curve expected from the WHH relation for 3D superconductors. Within the conventional BCS framework, the relation of H_{p}>H_{c2,0}(0) suggests that H_{c2}^{\perp} should be limited by the orbital effect, i.e., H_{c2,0}(0). For a layered superconductor in the LD regime, on the other hand, when the field is applied parallel to the plane (H\perpc), the kinetic energy of the orbital motion of the pairs caused by the magnetic field is depressed because of the weak electron transfer between layers. Consequently, the orbital limit becomes much higher than the expected value from the WHH relation. Although the obtained H_{c2}^{\perp}(0) seems to break through H_{p}=23.5 T, it can be reconciled by taking account of either the strong-coupling effect, 2\Delta=5k_{B}T_{c} (Ref. [25]), or reduction of the g factor. It is worth emphasizing that the observed T dependence of H_{c2}^{\perp}(T) is ascribable to the 2D character of the superconducting state.

In summary, we have measured the resistivity of oriented polycrystals ZrNCl_{0.7}. Magnetoresistance measurements have demonstrated anisotropic superconducting properties of the present material, which closely resemble those of the Li-doped HfNCl. The estimated anisotropy parameter

In the T range of 4-13 K, \rho(H) was measured for sample No. 1 using a solenoid-type superconducting magnet; in the T range of 0.5-4 K, \rho(H) was measured for sample No. 3 using the hybrid magnet. The dashed line in the figure is the line expected from linear extrapolation of the normal-state resistivity in Fig. 3(a).

The solid line represents the curve calculated using the WHH theory for 3D superconductors (see text).

  \gamma^{\rm{tot}}= 4.5 gives evidence for a 2D characteristic of the superconducting state in ZrNCl_{0.7}. The present studies were performed for oriented pellets, not for single-crystals, which would engender underestimation of the anisotropy of the superconductivity. Measurements using single-crystal samples are necessary to clarify the anisotropy of the superconducting state.

###### Abstract

We report magnetoresistance measurements of layered superconductor ZrNCl0.? at high magnetic fields (H) as high as 27 T and temperatures (T) as low as 0.5 K. The T dependence of the upper critical field H_{c2}(T) for H\leqc and H\leqc was obtained. H_{c2}(T) starts to increase with a gentle slope near T_{c}(0) followed by a steep slope with decreasing T, implying the dimensional crossover of the interplane coherence length from three dimensional to two dimensional (2D). The H_{c2}(T) is found to be anisotropic for the field direction, where the slope of H_{c2}^{\prime}=(dH_{c2}/dT) near H\approx 1 T can be estimated as H_{c2}^{+\frac{1}{2}}\sim -22.1 kOe/K and H_{c2}^{\prime 1}\approx\rightarrow4.9 kOe/K for H\leqc and H\leqc, respectively. The obtained anisotropy parameter \gamma\approx4.5 gives evidence for the 2D characteristic of the superconducting state in ZrNCl0.?

An unusual superconducting mechanism has been suggested^{9,-12} Ito _et al._ claimed that the 2D superfluid density n_{s,22}/m_{ab}^{3} (superconducting carrier density/effective mass) is a dominant determining factor for the high T_{c} in MNCl superconductors from \mu SR results.^{13}

The anisotropy of the upper critical field H_{c2}(T) was first reported for Li-doped HfNCl.^{4} However, lack of experimental data renders it impossible to discuss the T dependence of H_{c2} at T\rightarrow 0. Furthermore, T_{c}=25.5 K for Li-doped HfNCl is too high to determine the whole H_{c2} versus T phase. Recently, Ito _et al._ reported that the anisotropy ratio of H_{c2} for H\leqc (H_{c2}^{+}) to that for H\midc (H_{c2}^{+}) in Li0.17ZrNCl is roughly 3 (Ref. [13]). The entire H_{c2} versus T phase, however, has not been put forth yet. Together with results of Li-HfNCl (Refs. [4; 9]), the characteristics of the 2D superconducting state are believed to be important for the electron-doped MNCl system. Further measurements are required to clarify the intriguing superconducting properties in MNCl superconductors. In this sense, the studies of ZrNCl0.7 or Li,ZrNCl having lower T_{c}\sim 13 K might allow us to cover the whole H_{c2} versus T phase diagram, thereby bringing about intrinsic behavior of the quasi-2D superconductors. For those reasons, this study is intended to determine the H_{c2} versus T phase diagram for Cl-deintercalated \beta-ZrNCl (ZrNCl0.7) with T_{c}\sim 13 K.

Details of sample preparation and characterization for ZrNCl0.7 have been reported elsewhere.^{14} The powder sample was pressed into pellet form to orient ZrN planes (_ab_ plane) under 1.5 kbar (150 MPa) in argon atmosphere.^{4} Four oriented pellets, Nos. 1-4 were thus prepared. X-ray rocking curve measurements revealed that the _ab_ plane of the crystals were oriented in the pellets with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of less than 7^{\circ}. Resittivity measurements were carried out using a four probe dc/ac method in the T range of 0.5-300 K. Here, the samples were treated carefully in a glove box with high-purity He gas. The current and voltage leads were connected to the sample using silver paste with a toluene solvent; then they were covered with epoxy (stycast 1266) to prevent their degradation by exposure to moisture and oxygen. A magnetic field was provided by a conventional solenoid-type superconducting magnet in the field range of H=0-15 T, and by a hybrid magnet up to H=27 T at the High Field Laboratory for superconducting materials, IMR, Tohoku University. We also confirmed magnetization characteristics at various fields up to 5 T. Magnetic measurements showed that the substantial diamagnetic signals become apparent as the magnetic field increases above 1 T (not shown). These features are qualitatively identical to those for Li-HfNCl reported previously,^{4} in which the lowest-Landau-level (LLL) scaling analysis for the 2D superconducting fluctuations was adopted.^{15}

Figure 1 shows typical interplane resistivity \rho_{c} for the current direction of \midc (hereafter denoted as I_{c}) for sample No. 4 and in-plane resistivity \rho_{ab} for I\perpc (hereafter denoted as I_{ab}) for sample No. 2. The negative slope of resistivity d\rho(T)/dT< 0 was observed in the normal state near T_{c}. Similar behavior of the T dependence of resistivity was observed previously in Li0.17ZrNCl by Ito _et al._;^{13} that study indicated that d\rho(T)/dT< 0 is not intrinsic, but rather extrinsic because of grain boundaries. Actually, d\rho(T)/dT< 0 of the present ZrNCl_{0.7} depends strongly on the sample, but T_{c} hardly depends on it.

The remarkable feature in \rho(T) is that the interplane resistivity \rho_{c}(T) is about one hundred times larger than the in-plane resistivity \rho_{ab}(T), i.e., \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\!=\!10^{2}, but it is difficult to evaluate the absolute value of \rho_{c} accurately because of experimental problems including the terminal connection for the fragile pellet, anaerobic character, and misalignment effects. This feature indicates that the charge transfer between the layers is weak, being consistent with the 2D character of the electronic structure.[4, 5, 6, 7, 8] Similar but more pronounced anisotropy of resistivity has been reported for layered organic superconductors, e.g., \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\!\approx\!10^{3} in \kappa-(BEDT-TTF)_{2}Cu[N(CN)_{2}]Br. (Ref. [16]).

Figure 2 depicts the field-angle dependence of the resistivity at H\!\!=\!\!8 T and T\!\!=\!\!8 K. A clear but broad dip of the resistivity was observed for sample No. 2, reflecting the anisotropy of the superconducting state. Similar behavior was observed in other samples. Such broad dips indicate a considerably misaligned orientation. Although the x-ray rocking curve measurement indicated the highly oriented characteristic of the sample, it might overestimate the grain alignment in this pellet.

The T dependence of the resistivity under different magnetic fields with H\!\!\perp\!c and H\!\!\perp\!c is shown in Fig. 3. As mentioned previously, the observed superconducting transition for H\!\!\perp\!c might be broadened by both the grain boundaries and misalignment effects. On the other hand, we note here that, for H\!\!\parallel\!c, the respective broadenings of the resistive transitions are more remarkable than that for H\!\!\perp\!c; substantial suppression of T_{c}(H) is observed. These features are consistent with results of magnetization measurements near T_{c}. Such broadening of the superconducting transitions in resistivity and magnetization for H\!\!\parallel\!c is typical of low- dimensional superconductors. It is a natural consequence of the existence of superconducting fluctuations.[4, 15]

Figure 4 shows magnetoresistance for H\!\!\perp\!c and fields up to 27 T at different temperatures from T\!\!=\!\!13 to 0.5 K. The dashed line in the figure is the line expected from the linear extrapolation of the normal-state resistivity in Fig. 3(a). As mentioned in the previous text, the broad resistive transitions might be ascribed to both the grain boundaries and misalignment effects.

The T dependence of the H_{c2}(T) for H\!\!\perp\!c and H\!\!\parallel\!c is illustrated in Fig. 5. Here, T_{c} is tentatively defined by an 80% level of the normal-state resistivity because the broad resistive transitions prevent the exact determination of T_{c}(H). For that reason, the zero-field transition temperature, T_{c}(0), can be estimated as T_{c}(0)\!\approx\!12.8 K. Results showed that H_{c2}(T) starts to increase with a gentle slope near T_{c}(0) followed by a steep one with decreasing T. Such distinct behavior has been observed in other layered superconductors and is ascribable to the dimensional crossover from three

  dimensional (3D) to 2D caused by T dependence of the coherence length \xi(T). Under high magnetic fields that are stronger than 1 T, the slope H_{c2}^{\prime}=(dH_{c2}/dT) yields a value of H_{c2}^{\prime+}=-22.1 kOe/K and H_{c2}^{\prime-}=-4.9 kOe/K, respectively. The value of H_{c2}^{\prime}(0) is expected to be less than \approx7 T, and is consistent with previous results by Ito _et al._[13]

In general for layered superconductors, either the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model [17] or the 2D Lawrence-Doniach (LD) model [18] can be utilized, depending on the interlayer interaction in which the crossover from the LD to the GL regimes occurs at the boundary condition of \xi_{c}=dI\sqrt{2} with interlayer spacing d. The anisotropy parameter \gamma of the anisotropic GL model can be estimated as \gamma=H_{c2}^{\perp}/H_{c2}^{\parallel}= 4.5, which is direct evidence for quasi-2D aspects of the superconducting state. The GL coherence length \xi is calculated as \xi_{ab}= 71 A and \xi_{c}= 16 A, using relations -H_{c2}^{\perp}T_{c}=\phi_{0}/(2\pi\xi_{ab}^{\perp})T_{c} and \gamma=\xi_{ab}/\xi_{c} (Ref. [17]).

We next compare with Li-doped HfNCl homologue. In Li-HfNCl, \xi_{c}= 15.9 A is shorter than d\approx 19 A, indicating Josephson coupling between the adjacent layers. [4] In addition, ^{7}Li, ^{39}Cl, and ^{15}N NMR Knight-shift studies clarified that superconductivity is derived from the HfN layer. [4, 9, 10] It is noteworthy that \gamma= 4.5 for ZrNCl is larger than \Gamma= 3.7 for the Li-HfNCl homologue. [4] Within the framework of the anisotropic GL model, we expect \gamma(ZrNCl) <\gamma(Li-HfNCl) using the relations of d(ZrNCl) <d(Li-HfNCl) and \xi_{c}(ZrNCl) \sim\xi_{c}(Li-HfNCl). [4] On the other hand, the experimental result, \gamma(ZrNCl) >\gamma(Li-HfNCl), implies that the superconductivity of MNCl is independent of the interlayer spacing. Actually, the \muSR studies for a Li-doped ZrNCl system by Ito _et al._[13] also demonstrated that T_{c}, \xi_{ab} and n_{x}/m^{*} are independent of the interlayer distance, suggesting a highly 2D character of the superconductivity in MNCl. As mentioned previously, both the grain boundaries and misalignment effects are inevitable in the present sample, where misalignment by several degrees would lower the measured H_{c2}(0) by several tesla. [19] If the upturn of the H_{c2}(2) curve in the vicinity of H=0 is attributable to the 3D-2D crossover, a more realistic value of \xi_{c} of ZrNCl_{0.7} would be several angstrom; the estimated H_{c2}^{\perp}\sim 27 T might be underestimated, implying that \gamma>4.5.

We found that the observed H_{c2}^{\perp}(T) decreases linearly as T_{c}-T at T\rightarrow 0. The Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory predicts that H_{c2}(T) at T\rightarrow 0 K is fundamentally determined by the initial slope of the H_{c2} versus T curve, but is suppressed as H_{c2,0}=a(-dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}}T_{c} (a=0.73 for clean limit; a=0.69 for dirty limit) by the orbital pair-breaking effect. [20, 21] Furthermore, for spin-singlet superconductors, H_{c2} is suppressed by the Pauli paramagnetic pair-breaking limit defined by H_{p}=\Delta/\sqrt{2}\mu_{0}, where \Delta and \mu_{0} are the superconducting energy gap and the magnetic moment of electrons. [22, 23, 24]

If we apply the WHH theory for the clean limit case to H_{c2}^{\perp} of the present system, H_{c2,0}(0) can be estimated as =18.4 kOe using H_{c2}^{\prime\perp}=-22.1 kOe/K. We can also estimate the BCS Pauli limit as H_{p}= 23.5 T with T_{c}=12.8 K and \Delta= 3.5k_{B}T_{c}. The solid line in Fig. 5 is the theoretical curve expected from the WHH relation for 3D superconductors. Within the conventional BCS framework, the relation of H_{p}>H_{c2,0}(0) suggests that H_{c2}^{\perp} should be limited by the orbital effect, i.e., H_{c2,0}(0). For a layered superconductor in the LD regime, on the other hand, when the field is applied parallel to the plane (H\perpc), the kinetic energy of the orbital motion of the pairs caused by the magnetic field is depressed because of the weak electron transfer between layers. Consequently, the orbital limit becomes much higher than the expected value from the WHH relation. Although the obtained H_{c2}^{\perp}(0) seems to break through H_{p}=23.5 T, it can be reconciled by taking account of either the strong-coupling effect, 2\Delta=5k_{B}T_{c} (Ref. [25]), or reduction of the g factor. It is worth emphasizing that the observed T dependence of H_{c2}^{\perp}(T) is ascribable to the 2D character of the superconducting state.

In summary, we have measured the resistivity of oriented polycrystals ZrNCl_{0.7}. Magnetoresistance measurements have demonstrated anisotropic superconducting properties of the present material, which closely resemble those of the Li-doped HfNCl. The estimated anisotropy parameter

Figure 4: Magnetoresistance \rho(H) at selected temperatures. In the T range of 4-13 K, \rho(H) was measured for sample No. 1 using a solenoid-type superconducting magnet; in the T range of 0.5-4 K, \rho(H) was measured for sample No. 3 using the hybrid magnet. The dashed line in the figure is the line expected from linear extrapolation of the normal-state resistivity in Fig. 3(a).

The solid line represents the curve calculated using the WHH theory for 3D superconductors (see text).

  \gamma^{\rm{tot}}= 4.5 gives evidence for a 2D characteristic of the superconducting state in ZrNCl_{0.7}. The present studies were performed for oriented pellets, not for single-crystals, which would engender underestimation of the anisotropy of the superconductivity. Measurements using single-crystal samples are necessary to clarify the anisotropy of the superconducting state.
