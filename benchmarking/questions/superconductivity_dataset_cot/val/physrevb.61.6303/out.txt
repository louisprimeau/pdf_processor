###### Abstract

Eu2_{-},Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO_{x} with x  10 is shown to exhibit predicted superconductivity, as detected (i) by a sudden drop in surface resistance at _T_c  22 K, (ii) by vortex dissipation in an applied field at temperatures less than _T_c , and (iii) by measurements of diamagnetism (Meissner effect). This is our fourth successfully predicted high-temperature superconductor, based on a model with the primary superconducting layers in the charge-reservoirs, not in the cuprate planes.

## I Introduction

One of the primary tasks of a successful theory of high-temperature superconductivity is the prediction of which materials will superconduct (and which will not). We are aware of only three materials (i) that originally did not superconduct, (ii) that were predicted to be capable of superconducting at high temperatures, and (iii) that were subsequently shown to superconduct: PrBa2Cu3O7, 1-11 Gd1_{4}Ce0.6Sr2Cu2TiO10, 12-14 and Pr1.5Ce0.5Sr2Cu2Nb10. 15-17 (All were first _granular_ superconductors; subsequently, refined preparation techniques yielded _bulk_ superconducting PrBa2Cu3O7, 6.)

Footnote 1: The _bulk_ superconducting layer is a superconducting layer, and the _bulk_ superconducting layer is a superconducting layer.

Here we report a fourth superconductor, one which was predicted to superconduct on the basis of the charge-reservoir oxygen model,15,18,19 and, until the present work, has not been observed to superconduct. This superconductor is Eu2_{-},Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO_{x} with x  10 (Fig. 1) and its superconductivity has been detected (i) by observation of a sudden drop of surface resistance in zero applied magnetic field **H** at _T_c _m 22 K (Ref. [20]) (Fig. 2), (ii) by vortex dissipation in applied fields **H** at temperatures less than _T_c (Fig. 2), and (iii) by a Meissner effect (similar superconductivity (Fig. 4). Thus Eu2_{-},Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO_{10} is definitely a _granular_ superconductor from a class of materials that has previously yielded other granular superconductors: Gd1_{4}Ce0.5Sr2Cu2TiO10 (Refs. [12-14] and Pr1.5Ce0.5Sr2Cu2NbO10, 15-17 (This means that at least Nd1.5Ce0.5Sr2Cu2TiO10 and Sm1.5Ce0.5Sr2Cu2TiO10, should also superconduct, if fabricated correctly.)

## II Experimental details

Ceramic samples with nominal composition Eu1.5Ce0.5Sr2Cu2TiO_{x} were prepared using a solid state reaction technique. Prescribed amounts of Eu2O3, CeO2, TiO2, SrCO3, and CuO were mixed, pressed into pellets, and preheated at 1000 degC for about 1 day in the presence of flowing oxygen at atmospheric pressure. The reaction products were cooled, reground, and sintered at 1050 degC for 72 h in a slightly pressurized oxygen atmosphere, and then furnace cooled to ambient temperature.

 (SQUID). The magnetization was measured by two different procedures: (i) the sample was zero-field cooled to 5 K, a field was then applied, and finally the magnetization was measured as a function of temperature and (ii) the sample was field cooled from above 250 to 5 K and the magnetization was measured. Resistivity measurements were performed using the standard four-point technique.

Mossbauer spectroscopy studies of ^{151}Eu were carried out using a conventional constant-acceleration spectrometer and a 50 mCi ^{151}SmF_{3} source, and the isomer shifts were reported with respect to this source. Mossbauer spectroscopy performed at 300 K on ^{151}Eu shows a single narrow line of width 2.15(1) mm/s. The fit yields an isomer shift of 0.01(2) mm/s and a quadrupole splitting in the range of 5.58 mm/s. The small isomer shift values obtained indicate that the Eu ions are trivalent with a nonmagnetic J = 0 ground state.[22]

## III Superconductivity

Eu_{1.5}Ce_{0.5}Sr_{2}Cu_{2}TiO_{10} is a type-II superconductor according to the following measurements.

(i) Our first method of detecting the superconductivity was to measure the magnetic-field induced change in the microwave surface resistance, \Delta R_{S} = R_{S}({\bf H},T) - R_{S}({\bf H} = 0,T), of Eu_{1.5}Ce_{0.5}Sr_{2}Cu_{2}TiO_{10} as a function of both temperature T and applied magnetic field **H** (Fig. 2). The microwave frequency was 12.95 GHz. Figure 2 displays data which are typical of measurements on other high-temperature superconductors,[23] data taken for **H**\mid**J_{\rm rf}**, where **J_{\rm rf}** is the rf current density. These data show an onset in the field-induced change of the surface resistance \Delta R_{S}({\bf H},T) at T_{c} \approx 22 K, which is characteristic of vortex dissipation at and below T_{c} in a type-II superconductor.[20]

(ii) A bulk Meissner effect, corresponding to a 6% Meissner fraction, is observed at superconducting temperatures (Fig. 3).

(iii) As expected, for typical p-type doping, the Eu is in the Eu^{+3} charge state, as determined by Mossbauer isomer shift measurements.

Furthermore the dc resistance of the sample becomes flat as a function of temperature below T_{c}, as indicated in Fig. 4. We speculate that this behavior is a consequence of a granular material that has not reached the percolation threshold of its superconductivity. The microwave data are unambiguous in detecting superconductivity in a fraction of the sample. Because we have a finite Meissner effect, it is clear that we are rather close to percolation. Clearly Eu_{1.5}Ce_{0.5}Sr_{2}Cu_{2}TiO_{10} is a type-II granular superconductor.

## IV Critical Temperature and Valence

The superconducting critical temperature observed for Eu_{1.5}Ce_{0.5}Sr_{2}Cu_{2}TiO_{10} was \sim22 K, and should be compared

Figure 2: Measured Eu_{1.5}Ce_{0.5}Sr_{2}Cu_{2}TiO_{10} microwave dissipation, \Delta R_{S}({\bf H},T), as a function of temperature and applied field with **H**\mid**J_{\rm rf}**. The field-dependent dissipation is typical of what is observed for high-temperature superconductors. The broad signal in \Delta R_{S}({\bf H},T) for T < T_{c} is due to vortex dissipation.

  with the prediction of the empirical rule T_{c} = (15 K/A)_d_,15 which gives a predicted value of about 30 K for optimally doped material. We do not know if our material is optimally doped, but suspect that it is not--because no effort has been made to optimize the Ce doping. Hence, although the agreement of the measured T_{c} with the predicted empirical rule is reasonably good, improved doping is likely to increase T_{c} to a value nearer the prediction.

Ti is known to prefer the Ti+4 valence state, which appears to be consistent with the potential at its ideal site. If this charge state does indeed occur, then the material is different from some of its homologous compounds, such as Eu2--C Ce,Sr2Cu2RuO10, which has its Ru in the Ru+5 state, according to x-ray absorption spectroscopy [24] and Mossbauer measurements. [25] This valence difference would also imply that the two compounds have significantly different charge distributions, although both superconduct.

## V Evidence that Eu21-4 is not present as the main minority superconducting phase

The 22 K superconductor Eu2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 can be viewed as a superlattice of Eu1,5Ce0,5CuO4 (Eu21-4 with z = 0.5) and the layers /SrO/TiO2/SrO/CuO2/. Potentially Eu2--Ce,CuO4 could be present as a superconducting impurity phase. There are several facts which are inconsistent with such an interpretation, however.

First, in order to produce superconductivity in R2--Ce,5CuO4 materials, one must anneal them at ~950 degC under a reducing atmosphere of flowing Ar, and then quench them to room temperature in the same atmosphere. Otherwise, bulk superconductivity is not achieved. These conditions have not been met in the samples discussed here: For example, in producing Eu2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10, oxygen at a higher pressure than 1 atm was employed.

Second, the x-ray spectrum features extra peaks which do not match those expected for a Eu2--Ce,5CuO4 minority phase of Eu2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10; they do match to Eu2Sr2Cu2TiO1, even better than to Eu2CuO4.

Third, the observed T_{c} of the Eu2--Ce,5Sr2Cu2TiO10 is too high to be caused by Eu2--Ce,CuO4: Eu2--Ce,CuO4 has a critical superconducting transition temperature of only 7.5 K, [26, 27] too low to account for the observation of 22 K superconductivity of Eu1,5Ce0,5Sr2Cu2TiO10 as due to a Eu2--Ce,CuO4 substructure.

Fourth, the doping z is inconsistent with the superconductivity being due to Eu2--Ce,CuO4: Eu2--Ce,5Sr2Cu2TiO10 superconductors for z = 0.5, and Eu2--Ce,5CuO4 superconducts optimally for z = 0.15. Moreover, the possibility that z exceeds 0.2 or 0.3 is effectively ruled out by the fact that Ce has limited solubility in R2--Ce,CuO4 compounds, where R is a rare-earth ion. [28]

Fifth, the relations of Eu2--Ce,CuO4 and Eu2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 to Gd2--Ce,CuO4 and Gd2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 tend support to the picture that predicted the superconductivity of both Gd2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 and Eu2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10.

We were studied Gd2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 first, because Gd2--Ce,CuO4 does not superconduct, making it unnecessary for us to prove that the superconductivity we observe in Gd2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 is caused by Gd2--Ce,CuO4, which does not superconduct. (Gd2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 has T_{c}  11 K. [14]) Indeed the charge-reservoir oxygen model's argument, that Gd2--Ce,CuO4 fails to superconduct because Gd (i) is an L = 0 (and J  0) ion, (ii) is unaffected by crystal-field splitting, and hence (iii) is a Cooper pair breaker, also implies that the superconducting condensate of Gd2--Ce,5Sr2Cu2TiO10 cannot be in the cuprate planes: those planes are adjacent to the Gd, and should not superconduct (because of Gd pair-breaking) if the superconducting condensate is scattered by the Gd, as it is in Gd2--Ce,5CuO4, which has the same local structure as in Gd2--Ce,5Sr2Cu2TiO10. Consequently, the cuprate planes of Gd2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 cannot carry the primary superconducting condensate. Because Eu2--Ce,5Sr2Cu2TiO10 is isostructural to Gd2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10, its cuprate planes must not carry the primary superconductivity either. The superconducting condensate must be adjacent to the rare-earth R in R2--Ce,CuO4 compounds, but remote from it in R2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10. This is consistent with previous assignments of the superconductivity (i) to the vicinity of both the rare-earth site and the interstitial oxygen in the R2--Ce,CuO4 compounds [29] and (ii) to the SrO layers of the R2--Ce,5Sr2Cu2TiO10 materials. [14, 19] It is also consistent with differences in critical temperatures, such as observed in Eu2--Ce,CuO4 and in Eu2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10. [We are unaware of any explanation of the nonsuperconductivity of Gd2--Ce,CuO4 (Ref. 26) and (La1--_a_ Gd)2--_c_ CeCuO4 (Ref. 30) in terms of a cuprate-plane model.]

The differences between non-superconducting Gd2--Ce,CuO4 and superconducting Gd2--Ce,5Sr2Cu2TiO10 indicate that _different_ layers provide the primary superconductivity in the R2--Ce,5CuO4 homologues and in the R2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 compounds. (Previous work has shown that the R2--Ce,5CuO4 compounds superconduct in the vicinity of both the rare-earth and the interstitial-oxygen sites, [29] while R2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 superconducts primarily in its SrO layers. [14, 19]

Since Eu+3 is not a pair breaker in lowest order, we cannot conclude that the superconductivity is exclusively in the SrO layers of Eu2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10. However, any superconductivity in the cuprate-planes must be secondary.

## VI Conclusion

Eu1,5Ce0,5Sr2Cu2TiO10 superconducts with a critical temperature of T_{c} = 22 K, [20] as predicted by the charge-reservoir model of superconductivity. The fact that it does superconduct, lends support to the charge-reservoir oxygen model which (i) predicted the superconductivity and (ii) assigned the primary superconducting condensate to the SrO layers (which are the charge reservoirs), rather than to the cuprate planes.

## I Introduction

One of the primary tasks of a successful theory of high-temperature superconductivity is the prediction of which materials will superconduct (and which will not). We are aware of only three materials (i) that originally did not superconduct, (ii) that were predicted to be capable of superconducting at high temperatures, and (iii) that were subsequently shown to superconduct: PrBa2Cu3O7, 1-11 Gd1_{4}Ce0.6Sr2Cu2TiO10, 12-14 and Pr1.5Ce0.5Sr2Cu2Nb10. 15-17 (All were first _granular_ superconductors; subsequently, refined preparation techniques yielded _bulk_ superconducting PrBa2Cu3O7, 6.)

Footnote 1: The _bulk_ superconducting layer is a superconducting layer, and the _bulk_ superconducting layer is a superconducting layer.

Here we report a fourth superconductor, one which was predicted to superconduct on the basis of the charge-reservoir oxygen model,15,18,19 and, until the present work, has not been observed to superconduct. This superconductor is Eu2_{-},Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO_{x} with x  10 (Fig. 1) and its superconductivity has been detected (i) by observation of a sudden drop of surface resistance in zero applied magnetic field **H** at _T_c _m 22 K (Ref. [20]) (Fig. 2), (ii) by vortex dissipation in applied fields **H** at temperatures less than _T_c (Fig. 2), and (iii) by a Meissner effect (similar superconductivity (Fig. 4). Thus Eu2_{-},Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO_{10} is definitely a _granular_ superconductor from a class of materials that has previously yielded other granular superconductors: Gd1_{4}Ce0.5Sr2Cu2TiO10 (Refs. [12-14] and Pr1.5Ce0.5Sr2Cu2NbO10, 15-17 (This means that at least Nd1.5Ce0.5Sr2Cu2TiO10 and Sm1.5Ce0.5Sr2Cu2TiO10, should also superconduct, if fabricated correctly.)

 (SQUID). The magnetization was measured by two different procedures: (i) the sample was zero-field cooled to 5 K, a field was then applied, and finally the magnetization was measured as a function of temperature and (ii) the sample was field cooled from above 250 to 5 K and the magnetization was measured.

The small isomer shift values obtained indicate that the Eu ions are trivalent with a nonmagnetic J = 0 ground state.[22]

## III Superconductivity

Eu_{1.5}Ce_{0.5}Sr_{2}Cu_{2}TiO_{10} is a type-II superconductor according to the following measurements.

(i) Our first method of detecting the superconductivity was to measure the magnetic-field induced change in the microwave surface resistance, \Delta R_{S} = R_{S}({\bf H},T) - R_{S}({\bf H} = 0,T), of Eu_{1.5}Ce_{0.5}Sr_{2}Cu_{2}TiO_{10} as a function of both temperature T and applied magnetic field **H** (Fig. 2). The microwave frequency was 12.95 GHz. Figure 2 displays data which are typical of measurements on other high-temperature superconductors,[23] data taken for **H**\mid**J_{\rm rf}**, where **J_{\rm rf}** is the rf current density. These data show an onset in the field-induced change of the surface resistance \Delta R_{S}({\bf H},T) at T_{c} \approx 22 K, which is characteristic of vortex dissipation at and below T_{c} in a type-II superconductor.[20]

(ii) A bulk Meissner effect, corresponding to a 6% Meissner fraction, is observed at superconducting temperatures (Fig. 3).

(iii) As expected, for typical p-type doping, the Eu is in the Eu^{+3} charge state, as determined by Mossbauer isomer shift measurements.

Furthermore the dc resistance of the sample becomes flat as a function of temperature below T_{c}, as indicated in Fig. 4. We speculate that this behavior is a consequence of a granular material that has not reached the percolation threshold of its superconductivity. The microwave data are unambiguous in detecting superconductivity in a fraction of the sample. Because we have a finite Meissner effect, it is clear that we are rather close to percolation. Clearly Eu_{1.5}Ce_{0.5}Sr_{2}Cu_{2}TiO_{10} is a type-II granular superconductor.

## IV Critical Temperature and Valence

The superconducting critical temperature observed for Eu_{1.5}Ce_{0.5}Sr_{2}Cu_{2}TiO_{10} was \sim22 K, and should be compared

Figure 2: Measured Eu_{1.5}Ce_{0.5}Sr_{2}Cu_{2}TiO_{10} microwave dissipation, \Delta R_{S}({\bf H},T), as a function of temperature and applied field with **H**\mid**J_{\rm rf}**. The field-dependent dissipation is typical of what is observed for high-temperature superconductors. The broad signal in \Delta R_{S}({\bf H},T) for T < T_{c} is due to vortex dissipation.

  with the prediction of the empirical rule T_{c} = (15 K/A)_d_,15 which gives a predicted value of about 30 K for optimally doped material. We do not know if our material is optimally doped, but suspect that it is not--because no effort has been made to optimize the Ce doping. Hence, although the agreement of the measured T_{c} with the predicted empirical rule is reasonably good, improved doping is likely to increase T_{c} to a value nearer the prediction.

Ti is known to prefer the Ti+4 valence state, which appears to be consistent with the potential at its ideal site. If this charge state does indeed occur, then the material is different from some of its homologous compounds, such as Eu2--C Ce,Sr2Cu2RuO10, which has its Ru in the Ru+5 state, according to x-ray absorption spectroscopy [24] and Mossbauer measurements. [25] This valence difference would also imply that the two compounds have significantly different charge distributions, although both superconduct.

## V Evidence that Eu21-4 is not present as the main minority superconducting phase

The 22 K superconductor Eu2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 can be viewed as a superlattice of Eu1,5Ce0,5CuO4 (Eu21-4 with z = 0.5) and the layers /SrO/TiO2/SrO/CuO2/. Potentially Eu2--Ce,CuO4 could be present as a superconducting impurity phase. There are several facts which are inconsistent with such an interpretation, however.

First, in order to produce superconductivity in R2--Ce,5CuO4 materials, one must anneal them at ~950 degC under a reducing atmosphere of flowing Ar, and then quench them to room temperature in the same atmosphere. Otherwise, bulk superconductivity is not achieved. These conditions have not been met in the samples discussed here: For example, in producing Eu2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10, oxygen at a higher pressure than 1 atm was employed.

Second, the x-ray spectrum features extra peaks which do not match those expected for a Eu2--Ce,5CuO4 minority phase of Eu2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10; they do match to Eu2Sr2Cu2TiO1, even better than to Eu2CuO4.

Third, the observed T_{c} of the Eu2--Ce,5Sr2Cu2TiO10 is too high to be caused by Eu2--Ce,CuO4: Eu2--Ce,CuO4 has a critical superconducting transition temperature of only 7.5 K, [26, 27] too low to account for the observation of 22 K superconductivity of Eu1,5Ce0,5Sr2Cu2TiO10 as due to a Eu2--Ce,CuO4 substructure.

Fourth, the doping z is inconsistent with the superconductivity being due to Eu2--Ce,CuO4: Eu2--Ce,5Sr2Cu2TiO10 superconductors for z = 0.5, and Eu2--Ce,5CuO4 superconducts optimally for z = 0.15. Moreover, the possibility that z exceeds 0.2 or 0.3 is effectively ruled out by the fact that Ce has limited solubility in R2--Ce,CuO4 compounds, where R is a rare-earth ion. [28]

Fifth, the relations of Eu2--Ce,CuO4 and Eu2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 to Gd2--Ce,CuO4 and Gd2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 tend support to the picture that predicted the superconductivity of both Gd2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 and Eu2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10.

We were studied Gd2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 first, because Gd2--Ce,CuO4 does not superconduct, making it unnecessary for us to prove that the superconductivity we observe in Gd2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 is caused by Gd2--Ce,CuO4, which does not superconduct. (Gd2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 has T_{c}  11 K. [14]) Indeed the charge-reservoir oxygen model's argument, that Gd2--Ce,CuO4 fails to superconduct because Gd (i) is an L = 0 (and J  0) ion, (ii) is unaffected by crystal-field splitting, and hence (iii) is a Cooper pair breaker, also implies that the superconducting condensate of Gd2--Ce,5Sr2Cu2TiO10 cannot be in the cuprate planes: those planes are adjacent to the Gd, and should not superconduct (because of Gd pair-breaking) if the superconducting condensate is scattered by the Gd, as it is in Gd2--Ce,5CuO4, which has the same local structure as in Gd2--Ce,5Sr2Cu2TiO10. Consequently, the cuprate planes of Gd2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 cannot carry the primary superconducting condensate. Because Eu2--Ce,5Sr2Cu2TiO10 is isostructural to Gd2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10, its cuprate planes must not carry the primary superconductivity either. The superconducting condensate must be adjacent to the rare-earth R in R2--Ce,CuO4 compounds, but remote from it in R2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10. This is consistent with previous assignments of the superconductivity (i) to the vicinity of both the rare-earth site and the interstitial oxygen in the R2--Ce,CuO4 compounds [29] and (ii) to the SrO layers of the R2--Ce,5Sr2Cu2TiO10 materials. [14, 19] It is also consistent with differences in critical temperatures, such as observed in Eu2--Ce,CuO4 and in Eu2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10. [We are unaware of any explanation of the nonsuperconductivity of Gd2--Ce,CuO4 (Ref. 26) and (La1--_a_ Gd)2--_c_ CeCuO4 (Ref. 30) in terms of a cuprate-plane model.]

The differences between non-superconducting Gd2--Ce,CuO4 and superconducting Gd2--Ce,5Sr2Cu2TiO10 indicate that _different_ layers provide the primary superconductivity in the R2--Ce,5CuO4 homologues and in the R2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 compounds. (Previous work has shown that the R2--Ce,5CuO4 compounds superconduct in the vicinity of both the rare-earth and the interstitial-oxygen sites, [29] while R2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10 superconducts primarily in its SrO layers. [14, 19]

Since Eu+3 is not a pair breaker in lowest order, we cannot conclude that the superconductivity is exclusively in the SrO layers of Eu2--Ce,Sr2Cu2TiO10. However, any superconductivity in the cuprate-planes must be secondary.

## VI Conclusion

Eu1,5Ce0,5Sr2Cu2TiO10 superconducts with a critical temperature of T_{c} = 22 K, [20] as predicted by the charge-reservoir model of superconductivity. The fact that it does superconduct, lends support to the charge-reservoir oxygen model which (i) predicted the superconductivity and (ii) assigned the primary superconducting condensate to the SrO layers (which are the charge reservoirs), rather than to the cuprate planes.
