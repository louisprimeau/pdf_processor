###### Abstract

Measurements of the Seebeck coefficient _a_(_T_) and the resistivity _R_(_T_) of polycrystalline YBa2Cu3O7-8 quenched from different temperatures _T_q and of polycrystalline (Y1-_x_Ca2)(Ba2-_x_La)Cu3O6,9x+-0.01 were made to distinguish the contributions to _a_(_T_) from the Cu(1)O chains and the CuO2 sheets. The CuO2 sheets give a positive contribution to _a_(_T_) that is composed of a weakly temperature-dependent part a0 that decreases sensitively with increasing oxidation and an enhancement part _8a that gives a broad maximum to _a_(_T_) at a _T_max  140 degC. These two features together have been shown to distinguish the superconductive compositions from the parent and overdoped compositions in other copper-oxide superconductors. In fully oxidized YBa2Cu3O6,90, the contribution to _a_(_T_) from the CuO2 sheets is obscured by a dominant, competitive negative contribution to _a_(_T_) from the chains that has a similar, but negative, _8a enhancement.

In a previous study1 we have shown that a distinguishing feature of the superconductive CuO2 sheets in the _p_-type high-_T_c copper oxides is a Seebeck coefficient

\[\alpha = \alpha_{0} + \delta \alpha > 0\ ,\]

where a dopant-dependent a0 is only weakly temperature dependent and _d_a is an enhancement term giving rise to a broad maximum in a at a temperature _T_max  140 K. Overdoped CuO2 sheets were found to retain the _d_a enhancement, but to have a small and dopant-independent a0; the underdoped CuO2 sheets showed no _d_a term. Moreover, optimally doped CuO2 sheets that were semiconductive rather than superconductive also gave no _d_a term. In that paper, we restricted our investigation to copper oxides having single CuO2 sheets separated by an insulating nonsuperconductive layer in order to ensure that only the CuO2 sheets were contributing to a.

We argued that the appearance of a _d_a term requires an electron-energy dispersion curve and a well-defined Fermi surface, but that a _T_max  140 K is too high to be accounted for by a conventional _d_a enhancement arising from electron interactions with acoustic phonons. We postulated that a _d_a with a _T_max  140 K is a signature for a _vibronic_ state with strong coupling of electrons to optical-mode lattice vibrations and valence fluctuations. In the overdoped CuO2 sheets, the _vibrons_ would be distributed uniformly over all the Cu atoms of a CuO2 sheet; in the superconductive samples they would be confined to the volume within _correlation polarons_ that are condensed into a _polaron liquid_ having a relatively flat vibron-energy dispersion curve with a gap at the midband position. The strong dependence of a0 on doping in the superconductive samples was attributed to a dopant-dependent transfer of spectral weight from the upper and lower Hubbard bands of the parent phase to the vibronic states having energies in the gap between them.

A skepticism toward this interpretation may be encouraged by reports in the literature of quite different temperature dependences of the Seebeck coefficient for more complex superconductive oxides.2 In this paper, we point out that the data for more complex systems may contain a dominant contribution to a from metallic nonsuperconductive layers. We show, by way of example, that suppression of the contribution to a from the Cu(1)O_x_ chains in the 123 superconductive copper oxides reveals an a > 0 from the CuO2 sheets that exhibits both the _d_a term and the dopant-dependent a0 that are distinguishing features of the normal state of _p_-type copper-oxide superconductors.

The 123 structure of fully oxidized YBa2Cu3O7-8, d < 0.05, contains--on traversing the c axis-superconductive CuO2-Y-CuO2 layers with double CuO2 sheets of Cu(2) atoms in square-coplanar oxygen coordination oriented along the orthorhombic b axis. Resistivity measurements on twin-free single crystals3 have not only established the metallic character of the chains, but also a chain conductivity comparable to or larger than the conductivity of the CuO2 sheets; and two-dimensional positron annihilation has revealed a Fermi surface associated with the chains.4 Moreover, measurements of surface resistance in the microwave region below _T_c have indicated the presence of two energy gaps at the Fermi energy, one of which was assigned to the Cu(1)O chains.5 Seebeck data for YBa2Cu3O7-8 have been reported by many groups as cited, for example, in Refs. 6-8; however, meaningful comparison of the data with those for copper oxides having insulating nonsuperconductive layers requires subtraction from the measured net _a_(_T_) the contribution from the Cu(1)O chains, a contribution that has either been ignored or left undetermined in previous reports. Since the conductivity of the chains is comparable to that of the CuO2 sheets, the chain contribution to _a_(_T_) cannot be ignored; it may even prove to be dominant.9,10

In YBa2Cu3O6,96, the mean formal oxidation state of a Cu atom is +2.31. From valence-bond sums, the CuO2 sheets with optimally doped composition have been estimated11 to contain Cu(2) atoms with an oxidation state +2.18, which would give the Cu(1) atoms an oxidation state of +2.56. The CuO2 sheets of the superconductive copper oxides having insulating nonsuperconductive layers and a copper oxidation +2.18 all have an a = a0 + 8a > 0. On the other hand, a Cu(1) oxidation +2.56 should give a negative contribution to _a_(_T_) from the y2-_z_2 chain band. If the sign of the chain contribution to _a_(_T_) is negative whereas that from the CuO2 sheets is positive in superconductive YBa2Cu3O7-8, then the sign of the net _a_(_T_) would reflect the dominant contribution, which would be that of the more conductive structural element. Since the chain conductivity is reduced by oxygen vacancies or twins that break the linear chains into chain segments, the net _a_(_T_) should be sensitive to the oxygen concentration and to the oxygen ordering in the Cu(1)O1-8 planes. Reduction of a negative contribution to _a_(_T_) from the chains could result in a change from negative to positive in the sign of the net _a_(_T_), and the contribution to _a_(_T_) of the superconductive sheets would be fully manifest where the negative contribution from the chains is totally suppressed. Our experiments were designed to show how the net _a_(_T_) changes with suppression of the chain contribution to the total conductivity and hence to _a_(_T_).

Several ceramic samples of the (Y1-_x_Ca_x)(Ba2-_x_La_x)Cu3O7-8 system were made from La, Y, Cu oxides and Ca, Ba carbonates in proper ratios. Nominal La2O3 was preheated to 980 degC and cooled to room temperature before weighing. Well-ground mixtures were fired to 900 degC and sintered at 920 degC in air with several intermediate grindings.

Two sets of samples were studied, YBa2Cu3O7-8 of variable oxygen content and (Y1-_x_Ca_x)(Ba2-_x_La_x)Cu3O7-8 with optimum oxygen content. To vary the oxygen content and distribution in the Cu(1)O1-8 planes of YBa2Cu3O7-8, sintered pellets were annealed in air at 900 degC and then cooled slowly to a temperature _T_q before being dropped into liquid nitrogen. To maximize the oxygen content and ordering for all x in (Y1-_x_Ca_x)(Ba2-_x_La_x)Cu3O7-8, the samples were annealed in pure O2 at 400 degC and then cooled slowly in O2. Iodometric titration was used to obtain the oxygen parameter d. For samples quenched from _T_q, 400 < _T_q < 650 degC, the oxygen content varied over the range 6.54 < (7 - d) < 6.91. Samples annealed and slow cooled in O2 all had an oxygen content 6.96 +- 0.01 independent of x. All samples were single phase to x-ray powder diffraction.

The structural change from orthorhombic to tetragonal symmetry with _T_q in the first set of samples and with x in the second was monitored by precise scanning of the x-ray powder patterns in the range 31deg-34deg in 2_th_; curve fitting to Lorentzian functions decomposed the overlapping (110), (103), and (013) peaks in this range. The transport data were obtained with homebuilt apparatus; the Montgomery method12 was used to obtain the pellet resistivity from four-probe measurements.

Figure 1 shows the evolution of the lattice parameters with x in the doubly doped system (Y1-_x_Ca_x)(Ba2-_x_La_x)Cu3O7-8 with d = 0.04 +- 0.01. A complete solid solution can be obtained to x = 0.4; higher Ca contents are not accessible.13,14 An orthorhombic to tetragonal transition is found between x = 0.3 and x = 0.4, which is consistent with the literature data.14

Figure 2 presents the Seebeck _a_(_T_) and resistivity _R_(_T_) data for different values of x in the doubly doped system with maximum oxygen content. The orthorhombic x = 0 sample has a _T_c  90 K and shows a negative a0 and a whereas the tetragonal x = 0.4 sample has a _T_c = 78 K and shows a positive a0 and _8a. In the range 0.1 +- x <= 0.3, a temperature-independent a for T > _T_c is small, indicative of a near cancellation of negative and positive contributions; the _R_(_T_) curves show a shoulder at 90 K before dropping to zero at a _T_c that decreases with increasing x.

Figure 3 shows the _a_(_T_) and _R_(_T_) data for different values of _T_q for the YBa2Cu3O7-8 samples. Samples quenched from _T_q = 650 degC exhibit a large, positive net a0 and _8a with a _T_c  50 K whereas those quenched from

  T_{q}\!=\!400\,^{\circ}C have a T_{c}\!\approx\!90 K and a small, positive net \delta\alpha. The R\left(T\right) curves show T_{c} decreasing from about 85 K for T_{q}\!=\!450\,^{\circ}C to T_{c}\!=\!52 K for T_{q}\!=\!600\,^{\circ}C; at intermediate temperatures T_{q}\!=\!500 and 550\,^{\circ}C, a shoulder near 80 K in the R\left(T\right) curves indicates that the organization of pockets of well-ordered Cu(1)O chains begins below 600\,^{\circ}C.

Substitution of La for Ba in YBa_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{7\pm 6} introduces extra oxygen into the CuO_{1\pm 8} planes so as to maintain a nearly constant oxidation of the CuO_{2} sheets; the excess oxygen induces an orthorhombic to tetragonal transition to powder x-ray diffraction.[15, 16] In the system (Y_{1-x}Ca_{x})(Ba_{2-x}La_{x})Cu_{3}O_{6.96}, double doping keeps constant the oxygen content needed to maintain the overall mean oxidation state of the Cu atoms, but the oxygen ordering in the CuO_{1-8} planes is altered by the substitution of La^{3+} for Ba^{2+} in the neighboring planes. This alteration breaks the Cu(1)O chains by displacing oxygen atoms to a-axis positions; and at high enough La concentrations, long-range ordering of the chain segments is lost. Therefore, the contribution of the chains to the net conductivity, and hence also to the net \alpha(T), must decrease with increasing x in (Y_{1-x}Ca_{x})(Ba_{2-x}La_{x})Cu_{3}O_{6.96} even though the overall mean formal oxidation state of the copper remains constant.

Although the charge distribution between chains and CuO_{2} sheets may vary with increasing x, the small change in T_{c} suggests it changes little. A nearly constant value of T_{c} in the range 0.2\!\leq\!x\!\leq\!0.4 signals an essentialily constant oxidation of the CuO_{2} sheets in this compositional range, so we can attribute the remarkable change in \alpha(T) between samples x\!=\!0.3 and x\!=\!0.4 in Fig. 2 to a change in the contribution from the Cu(1)O chains. The change from orthorhombic to tetragonal symmetry between x\!=\!0.3 and x\!=\!0.4 testifies to a breakup of the long-range ordering of the chains, or chain segments; and the jump in R\left(T\right) indicates that in the orthorhombic phase the chain conductivity is comparable to, if not greater than, the conductivity of the CuO_{2} sheets. In the x\!=\!0 sample, the Cu(1)O chains give the dominant contribution to the conductivity and to \alpha(T); in the x\!=\!0.4 sample, the contribution from the CuO_{2} sheets is dominant. It is therefore significant that \alpha(T) for x\!=\!0.4 is positive and exhibits a T_{\rm max}\!\approx\!125 K, which is typical of what is found in other p-type copper-oxide superconductors.[1] Surprising to us is the character of the negative contribution from the Cu(1)O chains made manifest in the x\!=\!0 sample; it also exhibits a \delta\alpha enhancement with a T_{\rm max}\!\approx\!125 K, but of opposite sign to that of the x\!=\!0.4 sample. This finding implies a strong coupling between the vibrons of a CuO_{2} sheet and those of the neighboring chains. In the intermediate compositions 0.1\!\leq\!x\!\leq\!0.3, where the contributions to \alpha(T) from the Cu(1)O chains and CuO_{2} sheets are comparable, a nearly temperature

  independent \alpha would seem to indicate a cancellation of two \delta\alpha contributions each with a T_{\rm max} \approx 125 K.

At higher temperatures in air, oxygen is both increasingly disordered within and also lost from the Cu(1)O_{1-\delta} planes of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}[17] annealed samples quenched from different temperatures T_{q} reflect the oxygen concentration and ordering at T_{q}. Reduction of the CuO_{2} sheets with loss of oxygen from the Cu(1)O_{1-\delta} planes is reflected in the decrease in T_{c} with increasing T_{q} in Fig. 3. In this case also, breaking of the chains to suppress their contribution to \alpha(T) reveals an \alpha = \alpha_{0} + \delta\alpha > 0 for the CuO_{2} sheets with a \delta\alpha enhancement having a T_{\rm max} that increases with T_{q} over the range 120 <T_{\rm max} < 150 K. In addition, \alpha_{0} is seen to increase as the oxidation of the CuO_{2} sheets decreases, which was the other distinguishing feature of the superconductive CuO_{2} sheets found in superconductive copper oxides having insulating nonsuperconductive layers [1].

We turn finally to the shoulder observed in the R\,(T) curves of Figs. 2 and 3 in the transitional compositions where the contributions to \alpha(T) from the chains and CuO_{2} sheets appear to be comparable. The shoulder probably reflects the presence of domains within which the chain contributions still dominate. Conductive chains (or chain segments) appear to play an important role in raising T_{c} to its maximum value of about 90 K. However, the x = 0.4 and T_{q} = 650 degC samples exhibit no shoulder; in these samples the contribution to \alpha(T) from the CuO_{2} sheets appears to be homogeneously dominant.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the dominant contribution to the negative Seebeck coefficient \alpha(T) in fully oxidized YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.95\pm 0.01} is from the metallic Cu(1)O chains. In fact, suppression of the chain contribution reveals that the CuO_{2} sheets have an \alpha = \alpha_{0} + \delta\alpha > 0 with a \delta\alpha enhancement having a T_{\rm max} \approx 140 K and a dopant-dependent \alpha_{0}. These two features, taken together, have been shown to distinguish the superconductive normal state from the underdoped state on the one hand and the overdoped state on the other in p-type copper oxides having an insulating nonsuperconductive layer.

###### Abstract

Measurements of the Seebeck coefficient _a_(_T_) and the resistivity _R_(_T_) of polycrystalline YBa2Cu3O7-8 quenched from different temperatures _T_q and of polycrystalline (Y1-_x_Ca2)(Ba2-_x_La)Cu3O6,9x+-0.01 were made to distinguish the contributions to _a_(_T_) from the Cu(1)O chains and the CuO2 sheets. The CuO2 sheets give a positive contribution to _a_(_T_) that is composed of a weakly temperature-dependent part a0 that decreases sensitively with increasing oxidation and an enhancement part _8a that gives a broad maximum to _a_(_T_) at a _T_max  140 degC. These two features together have been shown to distinguish the superconductive compositions from the parent and overdoped compositions in other copper-oxide superconductors. In fully oxidized YBa2Cu3O6,90, the contribution to _a_(_T_) from the CuO2 sheets is obscured by a dominant, competitive negative contribution to _a_(_T_) from the chains that has a similar, but negative, _8a enhancement.

In a previous study1 we have shown that a distinguishing feature of the superconductive CuO2 sheets in the _p_-type high-_T_c copper oxides is a Seebeck coefficient

\[\alpha = \alpha_{0} + \delta \alpha > 0\ ,\]

where a dopant-dependent a0 is only weakly temperature dependent and _d_a is an enhancement term giving rise to a broad maximum in a at a temperature _T_max  140 K. Overdoped CuO2 sheets were found to retain the _d_a enhancement, but to have a small and dopant-independent a0; the underdoped CuO2 sheets showed no _d_a term. Moreover, optimally doped CuO2 sheets that were semiconductive rather than superconductive also gave no _d_a term. In that paper, we restricted our investigation to copper oxides having single CuO2 sheets separated by an insulating nonsuperconductive layer in order to ensure that only the CuO2 sheets were contributing to a.

We argued that the appearance of a _d_a term requires an electron-energy dispersion curve and a well-defined Fermi surface, but that a _T_max  140 K is too high to be accounted for by a conventional _d_a enhancement arising from electron interactions with acoustic phonons. We postulated that a _d_a with a _T_max  140 K is a signature for a _vibronic_ state with strong coupling of electrons to optical-mode lattice vibrations and valence fluctuations. In the overdoped CuO2 sheets, the _vibrons_ would be distributed uniformly over all the Cu atoms of a CuO2 sheet; in the superconductive samples they would be confined to the volume within _correlation polarons_ that are condensed into a _polaron liquid_ having a relatively flat vibron-energy dispersion curve with a gap at the midband position. The strong dependence of a0 on doping in the superconductive samples was attributed to a dopant-dependent transfer of spectral weight from the upper and lower Hubbard bands of the parent phase to the vibronic states having energies in the gap between them.

A skepticism toward this interpretation may be encouraged by reports in the literature of quite different temperature dependences of the Seebeck coefficient for more complex superconductive oxides.2 In this paper, we point out that the data for more complex systems may contain a dominant contribution to a from metallic nonsuperconductive layers. We show, by way of example, that suppression of the contribution to a from the Cu(1)O_x_ chains in the 123 superconductive copper oxides reveals an a > 0 from the CuO2 sheets that exhibits both the _d_a term and the dopant-dependent a0 that are distinguishing features of the normal state of _p_-type copper-oxide superconductors.

The 123 structure of fully oxidized YBa2Cu3O7-8, d < 0.05, contains--on traversing the c axis-superconductive CuO2-Y-CuO2 layers with double CuO2 sheets of Cu(2) atoms in square-coplanar oxygen coordination oriented along the orthorhombic b axis. Resistivity measurements on twin-free single crystals3 have not only established the metallic character of the chains, but also a chain conductivity comparable to or larger than the conductivity of the CuO2 sheets; and two-dimensional positron annihilation has revealed a Fermi surface associated with the chains.4 Moreover, measurements of surface resistance in the microwave region below _T_c have indicated the presence of two energy gaps at the Fermi energy, one of which was assigned to the Cu(1)O chains.5 Seebeck data for YBa2Cu3O7-8 have been reported by many groups as cited, for example, in Refs. 6-8; however, meaningful comparison of the data with those for copper oxides having insulating nonsuperconductive layers requires subtraction from the measured net _a_(_T_) the contribution from the Cu(1)O chains, a contribution that has either been ignored or left undetermined in previous reports. Since the conductivity of the chains is comparable to that of the CuO2 sheets, the chain contribution to _a_(_T_) cannot be ignored; it may even prove to be dominant.9,10

In YBa2Cu3O6,96, the mean formal oxidation state of a Cu atom is +2.31. From valence-bond sums, the CuO2 sheets with optimally doped composition have been estimated11 to contain Cu(2) atoms with an oxidation state +2.18, which would give the Cu(1) atoms an oxidation state of +2.56. The CuO2 sheets of the superconductive copper oxides having insulating nonsuperconductive layers and a copper oxidation +2.18 all have an a = a0 + 8a > 0. On the other hand, a Cu(1) oxidation +2.56 should give a negative contribution to _a_(_T_) from the y2-_z_2 chain band. If the sign of the chain contribution to _a_(_T_) is negative whereas that from the CuO2 sheets is positive in superconductive YBa2Cu3O7-8, then the sign of the net _a_(_T_) would reflect the dominant contribution, which would be that of the more conductive structural element. Since the chain conductivity is reduced by oxygen vacancies or twins that break the linear chains into chain segments, the net _a_(_T_) should be sensitive to the oxygen concentration and to the oxygen ordering in the Cu(1)O1-8 planes. Reduction of a negative contribution to _a_(_T_) from the chains could result in a change from negative to positive in the sign of the net _a_(_T_), and the contribution to _a_(_T_) of the superconductive sheets would be fully manifest where the negative contribution from the chains is totally suppressed. Our experiments were designed to show how the net _a_(_T_) changes with suppression of the chain contribution to the total conductivity and hence to _a_(_T_).

Several ceramic samples of the (Y1-_x_Ca_x)(Ba2-_x_La_x)Cu3O7-8 system were made from La, Y, Cu oxides and Ca, Ba carbonates in proper ratios. Nominal La2O3 was preheated to 980 degC and cooled to room temperature before weighing. Well-ground mixtures were fired to 900 degC and sintered at 920 degC in air with several intermediate grindings.

Two sets of samples were studied, YBa2Cu3O7-8 of variable oxygen content and (Y1-_x_Ca_x)(Ba2-_x_La_x)Cu3O7-8 with optimum oxygen content. To vary the oxygen content and distribution in the Cu(1)O1-8 planes of YBa2Cu3O7-8, sintered pellets were annealed in air at 900 degC and then cooled slowly to a temperature _T_q before being dropped into liquid nitrogen. To maximize the oxygen content and ordering for all x in (Y1-_x_Ca_x)(Ba2-_x_La_x)Cu3O7-8, the samples were annealed in pure O2 at 400 degC and then cooled slowly in O2. Iodometric titration was used to obtain the oxygen parameter d. For samples quenched from _T_q, 400 < _T_q < 650 degC, the oxygen content varied over the range 6.54 < (7 - d) < 6.91. Samples annealed and slow cooled in O2 all had an oxygen content 6.96 +- 0.01 independent of x. All samples were single phase to x-ray powder diffraction.

The structural change from orthorhombic to tetragonal symmetry with _T_q in the first set of samples and with x in the second was monitored by precise scanning of the x-ray powder patterns in the range 31deg-34deg in 2_th_; curve fitting to Lorentzian functions decomposed the overlapping (110), (103), and (013) peaks in this range. The transport data were obtained with homebuilt apparatus; the Montgomery method12 was used to obtain the pellet resistivity from four-probe measurements.

Figure 1 shows the evolution of the lattice parameters with x in the doubly doped system (Y1-_x_Ca_x)(Ba2-_x_La_x)Cu3O7-8 with d = 0.04 +- 0.01. A complete solid solution can be obtained to x = 0.4; higher Ca contents are not accessible.13,14 An orthorhombic to tetragonal transition is found between x = 0.3 and x = 0.4, which is consistent with the literature data.14

Figure 2 presents the Seebeck _a_(_T_) and resistivity _R_(_T_) data for different values of x in the doubly doped system with maximum oxygen content. The orthorhombic x = 0 sample has a _T_c  90 K and shows a negative a0 and a whereas the tetragonal x = 0.4 sample has a _T_c = 78 K and shows a positive a0 and _8a. In the range 0.1 +- x <= 0.3, a temperature-independent a for T > _T_c is small, indicative of a near cancellation of negative and positive contributions; the _R_(_T_) curves show a shoulder at 90 K before dropping to zero at a _T_c that decreases with increasing x.

Figure 3 shows the _a_(_T_) and _R_(_T_) data for different values of _T_q for the YBa2Cu3O7-8 samples. Samples quenched from _T_q = 650 degC exhibit a large, positive net a0 and _8a with a _T_c  50 K whereas those quenched from

The R\left(T\right) curves show T_{c} decreasing from about 85 K for T_{q}\!=\!450\,^{\circ}C to T_{c}\!=\!52 K for T_{q}\!=\!600\,^{\circ}C; at intermediate temperatures T_{q}\!=\!500 and 550\,^{\circ}C, a shoulder near 80 K in the R\left(T\right) curves indicates that the organization of pockets of well-ordered Cu(1)O chains begins below 600\,^{\circ}C.

Substitution of La for Ba in YBa_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{7\pm 6} introduces extra oxygen into the CuO_{1\pm 8} planes so as to maintain a nearly constant oxidation of the CuO_{2} sheets; the excess oxygen induces an orthorhombic to tetragonal transition to powder x-ray diffraction.[15, 16] In the system (Y_{1-x}Ca_{x})(Ba_{2-x}La_{x})Cu_{3}O_{6.96}, double doping keeps constant the oxygen content needed to maintain the overall mean oxidation state of the Cu atoms, but the oxygen ordering in the CuO_{1-8} planes is altered by the substitution of La^{3+} for Ba^{2+} in the neighboring planes. This alteration breaks the Cu(1)O chains by displacing oxygen atoms to a-axis positions; and at high enough La concentrations, long-range ordering of the chain segments is lost. Therefore, the contribution of the chains to the net conductivity, and hence also to the net \alpha(T), must decrease with increasing x in (Y_{1-x}Ca_{x})(Ba_{2-x}La_{x})Cu_{3}O_{6.96} even though the overall mean formal oxidation state of the copper remains constant.

Although the charge distribution between chains and CuO_{2} sheets may vary with increasing x, the small change in T_{c} suggests it changes little. A nearly constant value of T_{c} in the range 0.2\!\leq\!x\!\leq\!0.4 signals an essentialily constant oxidation of the CuO_{2} sheets in this compositional range, so we can attribute the remarkable change in \alpha(T) between samples x\!=\!0.3 and x\!=\!0.4 in Fig. 2 to a change in the contribution from the Cu(1)O chains. The change from orthorhombic to tetragonal symmetry between x\!=\!0.3 and x\!=\!0.4 testifies to a breakup of the long-range ordering of the chains, or chain segments; and the jump in R\left(T\right) indicates that in the orthorhombic phase the chain conductivity is comparable to, if not greater than, the conductivity of the CuO_{2} sheets. In the x\!=\!0 sample, the Cu(1)O chains give the dominant contribution to the conductivity and to \alpha(T); in the x\!=\!0.4 sample, the contribution from the CuO_{2} sheets is dominant. It is therefore significant that \alpha(T) for x\!=\!0.4 is positive and exhibits a T_{\rm max}\!\approx\!125 K, which is typical of what is found in other p-type copper-oxide superconductors.[1] Surprising to us is the character of the negative contribution from the Cu(1)O chains made manifest in the x\!=\!0 sample; it also exhibits a \delta\alpha enhancement with a T_{\rm max}\!\approx\!125 K, but of opposite sign to that of the x\!=\!0.4 sample. This finding implies a strong coupling between the vibrons of a CuO_{2} sheet and those of the neighboring chains. In the intermediate compositions 0.1\!\leq\!x\!\leq\!0.3, where the contributions to \alpha(T) from the Cu(1)O chains and CuO_{2} sheets are comparable, a nearly temperature

  independent \alpha would seem to indicate a cancellation of two \delta\alpha contributions each with a T_{\rm max} \approx 125 K.

At higher temperatures in air, oxygen is both increasingly disordered within and also lost from the Cu(1)O_{1-\delta} planes of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}[17] annealed samples quenched from different temperatures T_{q} reflect the oxygen concentration and ordering at T_{q}. Reduction of the CuO_{2} sheets with loss of oxygen from the Cu(1)O_{1-\delta} planes is reflected in the decrease in T_{c} with increasing T_{q} in Fig. 3. In this case also, breaking of the chains to suppress their contribution to \alpha(T) reveals an \alpha = \alpha_{0} + \delta\alpha > 0 for the CuO_{2} sheets with a \delta\alpha enhancement having a T_{\rm max} that increases with T_{q} over the range 120 <T_{\rm max} < 150 K. In addition, \alpha_{0} is seen to increase as the oxidation of the CuO_{2} sheets decreases, which was the other distinguishing feature of the superconductive CuO_{2} sheets found in superconductive copper oxides having insulating nonsuperconductive layers [1].

We turn finally to the shoulder observed in the R\,(T) curves of Figs. 2 and 3 in the transitional compositions where the contributions to \alpha(T) from the chains and CuO_{2} sheets appear to be comparable. The shoulder probably reflects the presence of domains within which the chain contributions still dominate. Conductive chains (or chain segments) appear to play an important role in raising T_{c} to its maximum value of about 90 K. However, the x = 0.4 and T_{q} = 650 degC samples exhibit no shoulder; in these samples the contribution to \alpha(T) from the CuO_{2} sheets appears to be homogeneously dominant.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the dominant contribution to the negative Seebeck coefficient \alpha(T) in fully oxidized YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.95\pm 0.01} is from the metallic Cu(1)O chains. In fact, suppression of the chain contribution reveals that the CuO_{2} sheets have an \alpha = \alpha_{0} + \delta\alpha > 0 with a \delta\alpha enhancement having a T_{\rm max} \approx 140 K and a dopant-dependent \alpha_{0}. These two features, taken together, have been shown to distinguish the superconductive normal state from the underdoped state on the one hand and the overdoped state on the other in p-type copper oxides having an insulating nonsuperconductive layer.
