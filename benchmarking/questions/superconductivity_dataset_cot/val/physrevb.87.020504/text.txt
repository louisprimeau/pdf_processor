###### Abstract

Through a combination of x-ray diffraction, electrical transport, magnetic susceptibility, and heat-capacity measurements, we report the effect of La doping on Sr in the newly discovered SrRiS\({}_{2}\) system. Superconducting transition with critical temperature \(T_{c}\) of 2.8 K, developed from a semiconducting-like normal state, was found in Sr\({}_{0.5}\)La\({}_{0.5}\)FBiS\({}_{2}\). A strong diamagnetic signal and a clear specific-heat anomaly associated with this transition were observed, confirming bulk superconductivity. The upper critical field \(H_{c2}(0)\) was estimated to be 1 T by using the Ginzburg-Landau approach. Our experiments therefore demonstrate that bulk superconductivity can be achieved by electron doping in the SrRiS\({}_{2}\) system.

Superconductivity within layered crystal structures has attracted sustained interest in the community of correlated electron systems, primarily due to the exotic superconducting properties they exhibit. Notable examples include the high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates with the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane and the Fe-based superconductors with Fe\({}_{2}\)Ar\({}_{2}\) (\(An\) = P, As, and Se) superconducting (SC) layers. Recently, superconductivity in the novel BiS\({}_{2}\)-based superconductor Bi\({}_{10}\)Al\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{3}\) with a superconducting transition temperature (\(T_{c}\)) of 8.6 K has been reported.\({}^{1}\) Immediately following this result, several \(Ln\)O\({}_{1-x}\)F\({}_{x}\)BiS\({}_{2}\) (\(Ln\) = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd) superconductors, with the highest \(T_{c}\) of 10 K,\({}^{2,-6}\) have then been discovered. While \(T_{c}\) is largely determined by a [\(Ln\)\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2-}\) blocking layer in these systems, all these superconductors share the common BiS\({}_{2}\) layer. Although these BiS\({}_{2}\)-based layered superconductors show a wealth of similarities to the iron pnictides, some differences are also manifest. First, the parent compound \(Ln\)rOBiS\({}_{2}\) is a bad metal without detectable antiferromagnetic transition or structure phase transition, implying that magnetism is of less importance to superconductivity in BiS\({}_{2}\)-based systems. Second, resistivity measurements in BiS\({}_{2}\)-based systems suggest that superconductivity appears in close proximity to an insulating normal state for the optimal superconducting sample,\({}^{5}\) in sharp contrast to the iron-based superconductors where superconductivity grows from a metallic state. Interestingly, pairing symmetry in layered BiS\({}_{2}\)-based compounds has yet to be determined albeit some theorists conjectured that BiS\({}_{2}\)-based compounds are strongly electron-phonon coupled superconductors, and the pairing symmetry may be an extended \(s\) wave with full gaps on different parts of Fermi surfaces,\({}^{7,8}\) in analogy to the iron-based superconductors.\({}^{9,10}\) However, the experimental evidence of pairing symmetry is still lacking thus far.

Very recently, a new BiS\({}_{2}\)-based layered compound SrBiS\({}_{2}\) has been reported.\({}^{11}\) This compound is isostructural to LaOBiS\({}_{2}\), with the [\(Ln\)\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2-}\) layer being replaced by an isocharged [Sr\({}_{2}\)F\({}_{2}\)]\({}^{2-}\) block, similar to the case of LaOFeAs and SrFFeAs. The resistivity of SrFBiS\({}_{2}\) shows the semiconducting behavior, however, no superconductivity has been reported in this system.

In this Rapid Communication, we report the successful synthesis and the detailed characterization of La-doped Sr\({}_{1-x}\)La\({}_{x}\)FBiS\({}_{2}\) (\(x=0,0.5\)) samples. The parent compound SrFBiS\({}_{2}\) exhibits thermally excited resistivity down to low temperature, consistent with the existing literature.\({}^{11}\) As \(x=0.5\), resistivity at normal state still shows the semiconducting behavior, but its absolute value drops by a factor of 2, followed by a sharp superconducting transition below 2.8 K. The strong diamagnetic signal and a clear specific-heat jump provide compelling evidence of bulk superconductivity in the Sr\({}_{1-x}\)La\({}_{x}\)FBiS\({}_{2}\) system. Finally, the specific-heat data show evidence of strong-coupling nature of the observed superconductivity.

The polycrystalline samples of Sr\({}_{1-x}\)La\({}_{x}\)FBiS\({}_{2}\) (\(x=0,0.5\)) used in this study were synthesized by a two-step solid state reaction method. The starting materials--La pieces, SrF\({}_{2}\) powder, Bi and S powder--are all of high purity (\(\geqslant\)99.9%). First, La\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{3}\) was presynthesized by reacting stoichiometric S powder and La pieces at 873 K for 10 h. After that, the as-grown La\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{3}\) and the powder of Sr\({}_{5}\)Sr\({}_{2}\), Bi, and S as starting materials were weighted according to their stoichiometric ratio and then fully ground in an agar mortar. The mixture of powder was then pressed into pellets, heated in an evacuated quartz tube at 1073 K for 10 h, and finally furnace cooled to room temperature. The whole process was repeated once again in order to get the pure phase.

Crystal structure characterization was performed by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) at room temperature using a D/Max-rA diffractometer with Cu \(K\alpha\) radiation and a graphite monochromator. Lattice parameters were obtained by Rietveld refinements. The electrical resistivity was measured with a standard four-terminal method covering the temperature range from 0.4 to 300 K in a commercial Quantum Design PPMS-9 system with a \({}^{3}\)He refrigeration insert. Specific-heat and Hall-effect measurements were also performed in this system. The temperature dependence of dc magnetization was measured on a Quantum Design MPMS-5.

Figure 1(a) shows the powder XRD patterns of the Sr\({}_{1-x}\)La\({}_{x}\)FBiS\({}_{2}\) (\(x=0,0.5\)) samples. Overall, the main diffraction peaks of these two samples can be well indexed based on a tetragonal cell structure with the \(P4/nmm\) space group. Extra minor peaks arising from the impurity phase of Bi\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{3}\) can also be seen. The content of impurity phase Bi\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{3}\) estimated by Rietveld fitting is about 15% and 12% for the parent compound (\(x=0\)) and the \(x=0.5\) sample, respectively. The lattice parameters of the parent compound SrFBiS\({}_{2}\) are extracted to be \(a=4.0820\) A and \(c=13.8025\) A by Rietveld fitting, in good agreement with the previous report.[11] For the La-doped sample, however, the (00\(l\)) peaks shift discernibly towards higher \(2\theta\) angles, suggesting the smaller \(c\)-axis constant. Thus, while the \(a\)-axis lattice parameter increases slightly to 4.0822 A in the La-doped sample, the \(c\) axis decreases significantly to 13.335 A, implying that the La impurity was indeed doped into the lattice, given that the ionic radius of the La ion is known to be smaller than that of Sr. This is quite similar to the case of LaO\({}_{1-x}\)F\({}_{x}\)BiS\({}_{2}\).[4] The resultant crystal structure is therefore schematically shown in Fig. 1(b), which is composed of a stacked rocksalt-type BiS\({}_{2}\) layer alternating with a fluorite-type SrF layer along the \(c\) axis.

The zero-field temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity (\(\rho\)) of these two samples is plotted in Fig. 2(a). For the parent SrFBiS\({}_{2}\) compound, the resistivity clearly shows thermally activated behavior with decreasing temperature from 300 K, and no resistivity anomaly can be observed down to 2 K. The thermal activation energy (\(E_{a}\)) obtained by fitting with the thermal activation formula \(\rho(T)=\rho_{0}\exp(E_{a}/k_{B}T)\) for the temperature range from 100 to 300 K is about 38.2 meV, consistent with previous studies.[11] However, it is noted that its absolute value is nearly two-thirds smaller than the reported value by Lei _et al.[11]_ We attribute this to the impurity phase of Bi\({}_{2}\)S\({}_{3}\) with sulfur deficiency[12] in our sample which may decrease the absolute value of resistivity. As Sr is partially replaced by La (\(x=0.5\)), the resistivity remains semiconducting-like at high temperatures, with the magnitude of resistivity substantially reduced compared to the undoped sample. Meanwhile, the \(E_{a}\) fitted at high temperature also decreases to 8.6 meV, suggesting the decrease of gap size because of electron doping. With further cooling down, a sharp superconducting transition with \(T_{c}\) of 2.8 K is clearly seen. This result is reminiscent of LaO\({}_{0.5}\)F\({}_{0.5}\)BiS\({}_{2}\), where the normal state shows semiconducting behavior, and it undergoes superconducting transition below 10 K.[2] Interestingly, the first-principles calculations[7] have suggested that there may be a charge density wave instability or an enhanced correlation effect in this system. Yet, no such instability can be detected merely from the resistivity measurement given in this study.

Figure 2(b) shows the close-up view of the low-temperature resistivity for Sr\({}_{0.5}\)La\({}_{0.5}\)FBiS\({}_{2}\) samples under various magnetic fields below 4 K. The inset gives the temperature dependence of the upper critical field \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(T)\), determined by using 90% normal state resistivity criterion. The temperature dependence of \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(T)\) is nearly linear in the temperature range studied. According to the Ginzburg-Landau theory, the upper critical field \(H_{c2}\) evolves with temperature following the formula

\[H_{c2}(T)=H_{c2}(0)(1-t^{2})/(1+t^{2}),\] (1)

where \(t\) is the renormalized temperature _T_/\(T_{c}\). It is found that the upper critical field \(H_{c2}\) as drawn can be well fitted by this model and its zero-temperature limit is estimated to be 1.04 T.

In order to verify the bulk nature of the observed superconductivity, the temperature dependence of dc magnetic susceptibility was measured under 5 Oe magnetic field with both zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) modes for the superconducting samples (Fig. 3). The strong diamagnetic signal was observed for the Sr\({}_{0.5}\)La\({}_{0.5}\)FBiS\({}_{2}\) sample. The \(T_{c}\) value determined from the magnetic susceptibility agrees well with the one extracted from the resistivity data. The estimated volume fraction of magnetic shielding from ZFC data is over 30%, bearing out the bulk superconductivity. Note that the

(b) Temperature dependence of resistivity for Sr\({}_{0.5}\)La\({}_{0.5}\)FBiS\({}_{2}\) samples under several different magnetic fields (\(B=0.05,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.6,0.8,1\) T).

  Meissner volume fraction estimated by FC measurement data also exceeds 20%, indicating the high-quality superconducting sample.

To further study its superconducting properties, the specific-heat measurement of the Sr\({}_{0.5}\)La\({}_{0.5}\)FBiS\({}_{2}\) sample was performed in the temperature range from 0.5 to 5 K. As plotted in Fig. 4, a clear specific-heat jump can be observed at \(T_{c}=2.8\) K, further confirming the bulk superconductivity. Below 1.5 K, however, the low-temperature heat capacity undergoes a moderate upturn which very likely arises from Schottky anomaly associated with the impurities phase or the freezing out of La nuclear spins.[13] Taking into account the Schottky anomaly component, the overall specific heat can be written as

\[C/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}+\alpha/T^{3},\] (2)

where \(\gamma\) and \(\beta T^{2}\) account for the electronic and lattice contributions, respectively, and the last term, \(\alpha/T^{3}\), is the Schottky anomaly. The plot of _C/T_-\(\alpha/T^{3}\) versus \(T^{2}\) shows a linear behavior in the high-temperature range from 2.9 to 5 K (data not explicitly shown here). The resultant electronic coefficient \(\gamma\) and the lattice coefficient \(\beta\) are 1.42 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) and \(\beta=0.414\) mJ/mol K\({}^{4}\), respectively. The Debye temperature is then estimated to be 265 K. This value is somewhat smaller that those of LaONiAs,[14] LaOFeP,[15] and LaO\({}_{0.89}\)F\({}_{0.11}\)FeAs.[16] The lattice contribution was further subtracted in the inset in order to see the clear specific-heat jump at the SC transition. The corresponding electronic specific jump at \(T_{c}\), therefore, is estimated to be \(\Delta C_{c}/\gamma\,T_{c}=1.4\), very close to the weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) value of 1.43. Considering the relatively low volume fraction of magnetic shielding suggested from susceptibility measurement, the real size of \(\Delta C_{c}/\gamma\,T_{c}\) ought to be much larger than the BCS value, implying that SC in Sr\({}_{0.5}\)La\({}_{0.5}\)FBiS\({}_{2}\) likely involves a strong electron-phonon coupling, consistent with the theoretical prediction.[7]

Finally, the temperature dependence of Hall coefficient \(R_{H}\) for the Sr\({}_{0.5}\)La\({}_{0.5}\)FBiS\({}_{2}\) sample is shown in Fig. 5. The negative \(R_{H}\) signal covers the whole temperature region, indicating that the electron-type charge carrier is dominant in this sample. Clearly, \(R_{H}\) is \(T\) independent at the high-temperature regime, and drops drastically below 50 K. The result reminds us of the similar behavior observed in iron-based SC, where \(R_{H}\) decreases sharply due to spin-density-wave (SDW) formation.[17] In the present sample, however, no SDW/CDW anomaly has been observed in the measurements of resistivity and magnetization. On the other hand, it is known that the inherent impurity phase may act to smear out the anomalies in the resistivity and susceptibility. In this regard, it would be interesting to clarify this problem by first-principles calculations[7] or further improving the sample quality. In a single-band metal, the Hall coefficient \(R_{H}\) is associated with carrier density (\(n\)) as \(R_{H}=1/ne\). We therefore estimate the charge-carrier density to be \(1.05\times 10^{19}/\)cm\({}^{3}\) at 5 K, which is similar to the Bi\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{4}\)S\({}_{3}\) system[18] and iron-based superconductors[19] with a very low superfluid density. In addition, we cannot rule out the multiband effect[5] as the origin of the drop in \(R_{H}\).

In summary, we study the electron doping effect, i.e., partially substituting La for Sr, in the newly discovered SrBiS\({}_{2}\) system. The parent compound shows semiconducting-like resistivity with decreasing temperature. Via electron doping, we discovered a BiS\({}_{2}\)-based superconductor Sr\({}_{0.5}\)La\({}_{0.5}\)FBiS\({}_{2}\) with a \(T_{c}\) as high as 2.8 K. Importantly, this superconductivity was found to develop on the background of an insulating normal state, raising a question of whether this superconductor is in proximity to a Mott insulator or a band insulator. Based

  on the heat-capacity measurement, we speculate that the superconducting electron pairs might have a strong-coupled nature. In this regard, it would certainly be interesting to identify the symmetry of superconducting order parameter in this system along with other BiS\({}_{2}\)-based superconductors.
