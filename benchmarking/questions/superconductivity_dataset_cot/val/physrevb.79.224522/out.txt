## I Introduction

Among ternary intermetallic compounds, ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type intermetallics have been extensively studied, especially for the interest of the superconducting and magnetic properties. The structure of ThCr_{2}Si_{2} is the ordered ternary derivative of the binary BaAl_{4}-type structure.[1] Although numerous ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type intermetallics have been reported so far, superconductivity is observed only for some compounds. The critical temperature (_T_{c}_) of those compounds is generally very low, as reported for LaPd_{2}Ge_{2} and LaIr_{2}Ge_{2} with _T_{c}_'s of 1.12 (Ref. 2) and 1.5 K,[3] respectively.

Many works were carried out for the discovery of new intermetallic superconductors with higher _T_{c}_'s. Some intermetallic superconductors with relatively high _T_{c}_'s, such as MgB_{2} with AlB_{2}-type structure,[4] were reported so far. Concerning the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure, quaternary intermetallics _RET_{2}_B_{2}C with ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-derivative structure were discovered.[5, 6, 7, 8] Among these borocarbides, YPd_{2}B_{2}C shows the highest _T_{c}_ of 23 K. Furthermore, recently new ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type superconductors (Ba,Sr)_{1-x}(K,Cs)_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} were discovered with _T_{c}_'s up to 38 K.[9, 10] Thus, this structure is one of the keys to search new intermetallic superconductors with higher _T_{c}_'s. In this paper we report one of the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type superconductors, SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}, with a _T_{c}_ of 3.04 K.

## II Experimental

Starting materials were Sr (sheet, 99% in purity), Pd (sheet, 99.95%), and Ge (grain, 99.99%). They were arc melted with a stoichiometric ratio of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} under Ar gas atmosphere on a water-cooler copper hearth. The melting was repeated several times with the button turned over between each melt. First Pd and Ge were arc melted and then the melted buttons were melted together with Sr in order to minimize the loss of Sr. The weight loss after the melting was within a few percent. The obtained buttons wrapped in a Ti foil were annealed in an evacuated silica tube at 1173 K for one week and quenched into a cold water bath.

Phase identification was carried out for crushed samples by an x-ray diffraction (XRD) method with an x-ray diffractometer JEOL JDX-3500 with monochromatized Cu _K\alpha_ radiation. Single crystals for structural analyses picked up from the crushed samples were glued on the top of a glass fiber and mounted on the goniometer head. X-ray single-crystal diffraction data were collected at room temperature 293(2) K using a Bruker SMART APEX charge-coupled device (CCD) area-detector diffractometer with graphite monochromatized Mo _K\alpha_ radiation (\lambda = 0.071 073 nm). The absorption correction and structural refinement were carried out using the programs SADABS and SHELXJ.97.[11, 12] Microstructural observation was carried out using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) JEOL JSM-6301F with an energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectrometer.

dc magnetization measurements were performed for polycrystalline bulk samples with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer Quantum Design MPMS XL. Field-dependent and temperature-dependent magnetization [M(H) and M(T)] curves were recorded at temperatures above 1.8 K in fields up to 2 kOe. The volume fraction of superconducting phase was estimated from the magnitude of zero-field cooling (ZFC) magnetization in a field of 10 Oe in the M(T) measurements. The _T_{c}_ was defined as the onset temperature where a diamagnetic signal was observed. Electrical resistivity (\rho) measurements were carried out for polycrystalline samples in the temperature range from 1.8 to 300 K in magnetic fields up to 1.2 kOe by a standard dc four-probe method. Each measurement was carried out for a few samples to check reproducibility.

## III Results and Discussion

### Structural analyses

Figure 1 shows the XRD pattern of crushed powder sample of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}. Most of the diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern are indexed on the basis of a tetragonal unit cell with lattice parameters of a = 0.441 and c = 1.013 nm. The reflection condition is h + k + l = 2n. This indicates that the lattice is body centered with one of suggested space groups I4_m_2, I4_m_m_, I4_m_m_, I4_22, and I4_/_mmm_. SEM-EDX analyses were performed on the polished cross section of the button of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}. The composition of the main phase in these samples is Sr\cdotPd\cdotGe\,=\,1\cdot2\cdot2, indicating that the phase with the tetragonal cell is indeed SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}.

Shiny crystals picked up from the crushed samples were used for structural refinement. Preliminary investigations indicated that these crystals have nearly the same lattice parameters as the crushed samples mentioned above.

 The lattice parameters of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} are almost equal to other ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type intermetallics with space group I4/_mmm_. For example, the parameters of SrRh_{2}Ge_{2} with this structure are a = 0.4183 and c = 1.0718 nm.[13] Therefore, the structural refinements were first carried out on the basis of the model of the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure. Table 1 lists the atomic coordinates and equivalent thermal parameters. The crystal data and the results of structural refinements are listed in Table 2. The small R factors indicate that the structure of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} is ThCr_{2}Si_{2} type. Compared with the lattice parameters of ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type SrNi_{2}Ge_{2} with the lattice parameters of a = 0.4188 and c = 1.0254 nm,[14] replacement of Ni with a larger atom Pd causes quite a large elongation of the a axis parameters, whereas the c axis parameters are almost the same. The same trend is observed for LaM_{2}Ge_{2} (_M_ = Ni and Pd). The lattice parameters of LaNi_{2}Ge_{2} are a = 0.4187 and c = 0.9918 nm,[14] whereas LaPd_{2}Ge_{2} shows a = 0.43669 and c = 1.0027 nm.[15]

### Superconducting properties

Figure 2 shows temperature-dependent dc magnetization measured in both ZFC and field cooling (FC) modes for SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}. The diamagnetic signals are observed at 3.04 K for both modes with a 10%-90% transition width (\Delta T_{c}) of about 0.1 K. The as-melted SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} samples show a slightly higher _T_c of 3.10 K with a \Delta T_{c} of 0.15 K. The detail of the region in the vicinity of _T_c is shown in the inset. The magnitude of the magnetic shielding signal after being corrected for demagnetization effects is approximately equal to 100% of that estimated for perfect diamagnetism, while the magnitude of flux expulsion (Meissner effect) is 7% of that estimated for perfect diamagnetism. These indicate that the superconductivity is a bulk effect. Taking account of the existence of hysteresis observed between the signals in ZFC and FC modes, we conclude that the SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} is a type II superconductor.

Figure 3 shows the _M_(_H_) curves measured at various temperatures for SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}. The details of the same curves in the background region are shown in the inset. These curves are characteristic for type II superconductors. Figure 4 shows the _M_(_T_) curves measured for SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} at various magnetic fields. The details of the same curves in the vicinity of _T_c are also shown in the inset.

Figure 5 shows the electrical resistivity \rho as a function of temperature in magnetic fields. The resistivity decreases with decreasing temperature, showing metalliclike conductivity. From 300 to 30 K, the temperature-dependent resistivity curve shows a small negative curvature. Such a curvature is also observed for U_{3}Ni_{4}Si_{4}-type La_{3}M_{x}^{\prime}X_{4} (_M_^{\prime} = Ni and Pd, X = Si and Ge) superconductors consisting of the combination of structural units of AlB_{2}-type LaM^{\prime}X and ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type LaM_{x}^{\prime}X_{2} layers.[16, 17] The onset temperature of the transition in 0 Oe is 3.09 K and zero resistance is observed at 3.03 K.

  detail of the region in the vicinity of T_{c} is shown in the inset. The room-temperature resistivity, \rho(300 K), is approximately 30 \mu\Omega cm and the residual resistivity, \rho(res), just above T_{c} is 2.5 \mu\Omega cm. Therefore, the residual resistivity ratio is \rho(300 K)/\rho(res) = 12, indicating that the sample has a good quality. With increasing applied magnetic fields, the T_{c} decreases and zero resistance is no longer observed in fields above 600 Oe.

The apparent lower critical field (H_{c1}^{*}) was determined by low-field magnetization measurements with the SQUID magnetometer. H_{c1}^{*} at various temperatures was taken as the point of deviation of M(H) from the linear M-H behavior observed at low fields. The true lower critical field (H_{c1}) was obtained from the H_{c1}^{*} by applying the correction for the demagnetization factor. The H_{c1} as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 6. Fitting the formula H_{c1}=H_{c1}(0)[1 -(T/T_{c})^{2}], H_{c1}(0) = 180 Oe and T_{c}

  The upper critical field (H_{c2}) was estimated from both M(H) and M(T) curves. For the M(H) curves, the H_{c2} was determined from the point where the M(H) curves reach the background. For the M(T) curves, the H_{c2} was estimated, taking account of the onset point of superconducting transition of the M(T) curves. The H_{c2} estimated from these curves as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 7. The gradient -dH_{c2}/dT is estimated to be 0.84 and 0.83 kOe/K for H_{c2}^{H_{c2}M(T)} and H_{c2}^{M_{c2}T(T)} curves, respectively. These values are much lower than those of the same ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type (Ba, K)Fe_{2}As_{2} and ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-derivative borocarbides. The -dH_{c2}/dT of the (Ba, K)Fe_{2}As_{2} single crystal is 29 and 54 kOe/K for H\parallelc and H\perpc, respectively.[21] The borocarbides show the -dH_{c2}/dT value of 8 kOe/K.[18] On the other hand, the same ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type BaNi_{2}P_{2} single crystal with a T_{c} of 2.51 K shows the comparable -dH_{c2}/dT values of about 0.4 and 1 kOe/K for H\parallel\perpc, respectively.[20]

Linear extrapolation of the H_{c2}(T) curves obtained from the M(H) and M(T) curves gives H_{c2}^{H_{c2}M(0)}=2.6 kOe and H_{c2}^{M_{c2}T(0)}=2.4 kOe, respectively. On the other hand, assuming the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula H_{c2}^{\rm WHH(0)}=-0.697_{c}(dH_{c2}/dT)_{\rm rc2}[22]H_{c2}^{\rm WHH(0)} values of 1.8 and 1.7 kOe are obtained from H_{c2}^{M_{c2}(0)} and H_{c2}^{M_{c2}T(0)} curves, respectively. H_{c2}^{\rm oz}T(T) which is defined as the field where the 1% decrease in \rho at the superconducting transition of the \rho(T) curves is observed in Fig. 5 gives -dH_{c2}/dT =1.0 kOe/K and H_{c2}^{\rm WHH(0)}=2.1 kOe. In the following calculations, we have used intermediate H_{c2}^{\rm WHH(M-H)}(0) for H_{c2}(0) among these three values.

With the formula H_{c2}(0)=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi(0)^{2} (\Phi_{0} is the flux quantum), the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence length \xi(0) is estimated to be 43 nm. From H_{c2}(0) and \xi(0) the penetration depth, \lambda(0), is calculated to be 71 nm with the formula H_{c1}(0)=[\Phi_{0}/4\pi\lambda(0)^{2}]ln[\lambda(0)/\xi(0)]. The GL parameter, \kappa(0)[=\lambda(0)/\xi(0)], is 1.6. This value of the GL parameter is quite small. It is noted that LaPd_{2}Ge_{2}, obtained by the replacement of Sr with La in SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}, is a type I superconductor with a T_{c} of 1.12 K.[2] On the other hand, thermodynamic critical field [H_{c}(0)] is estimated to be 770 Oe, with the formula of H_{c}(0)=H_{c2}(0)/\,\gamma\,\kappa(0). Table 3 lists these measured and calculated superconducting properties for SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}.

## IV Conclusions

We have prepared ternary germanide SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} by arc melting. This is isostructural with the recently discovered ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type superconductors (Ba,Sr)_{1-x}(K,Cs)_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} with space group I4/mmm. The lattice parameters of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} are a=0.440 88(2) and c=1.012 70(8) nm. dc magnetization and electrical resistivity measurements indicated that the SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} is a type II superconductor with a T_{c} of 3.04 K.

## I Introduction

Among ternary intermetallic compounds, ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type intermetallics have been extensively studied, especially for the interest of the superconducting and magnetic properties. The structure of ThCr_{2}Si_{2} is the ordered ternary derivative of the binary BaAl_{4}-type structure.[1] Although numerous ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type intermetallics have been reported so far, superconductivity is observed only for some compounds. The critical temperature (_T_{c}_) of those compounds is generally very low, as reported for LaPd_{2}Ge_{2} and LaIr_{2}Ge_{2} with _T_{c}_'s of 1.12 (Ref. 2) and 1.5 K,[3] respectively.

Many works were carried out for the discovery of new intermetallic superconductors with higher _T_{c}_'s. Some intermetallic superconductors with relatively high _T_{c}_'s, such as MgB_{2} with AlB_{2}-type structure,[4] were reported so far. Concerning the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure, quaternary intermetallics _RET_{2}_B_{2}C with ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-derivative structure were discovered.[5, 6, 7, 8] Among these borocarbides, YPd_{2}B_{2}C shows the highest _T_{c}_ of 23 K. Furthermore, recently new ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type superconductors (Ba,Sr)_{1-x}(K,Cs)_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} were discovered with _T_{c}_'s up to 38 K.[9, 10] Thus, this structure is one of the keys to search new intermetallic superconductors with higher _T_{c}_'s. In this paper we report one of the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type superconductors, SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}, with a _T_{c}_ of 3.04 K.

## II Experimental

Starting materials were Sr (sheet, 99% in purity), Pd (sheet, 99.95%), and Ge (grain, 99.99%). They were arc melted with a stoichiometric ratio of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} under Ar gas atmosphere on a water-cooler copper hearth. The melting was repeated several times with the button turned over between each melt. First Pd and Ge were arc melted and then the melted buttons were melted together with Sr in order to minimize the loss of Sr. The weight loss after the melting was within a few percent. The obtained buttons wrapped in a Ti foil were annealed in an evacuated silica tube at 1173 K for one week and quenched into a cold water bath.

The absorption correction and structural refinement were carried out using the programs SADABS and SHELXJ.97.[11, 12] Microstructural observation was carried out using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) JEOL JSM-6301F with an energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectrometer.

dc magnetization measurements were performed for polycrystalline bulk samples with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer Quantum Design MPMS XL. Field-dependent and temperature-dependent magnetization [M(H) and M(T)] curves were recorded at temperatures above 1.8 K in fields up to 2 kOe. The volume fraction of superconducting phase was estimated from the magnitude of zero-field cooling (ZFC) magnetization in a field of 10 Oe in the M(T) measurements. The _T_{c}_ was defined as the onset temperature where a diamagnetic signal was observed. Electrical resistivity (\rho) measurements were carried out for polycrystalline samples in the temperature range from 1.8 to 300 K in magnetic fields up to 1.2 kOe by a standard dc four-probe method. Each measurement was carried out for a few samples to check reproducibility.

## III Results and Discussion

### Structural analyses

Figure 1 shows the XRD pattern of crushed powder sample of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}. Most of the diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern are indexed on the basis of a tetragonal unit cell with lattice parameters of a = 0.441 and c = 1.013 nm. The reflection condition is h + k + l = 2n. This indicates that the lattice is body centered with one of suggested space groups I4_m_2, I4_m_m_, I4_m_m_, I4_22, and I4_/_mmm_. SEM-EDX analyses were performed on the polished cross section of the button of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}. The composition of the main phase in these samples is Sr\cdotPd\cdotGe\,=\,1\cdot2\cdot2, indicating that the phase with the tetragonal cell is indeed SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}.

Shiny crystals picked up from the crushed samples were used for structural refinement. Preliminary investigations indicated that these crystals have nearly the same lattice parameters as the crushed samples mentioned above.

 The lattice parameters of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} are almost equal to other ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type intermetallics with space group I4/_mmm_. For example, the parameters of SrRh_{2}Ge_{2} with this structure are a = 0.4183 and c = 1.0718 nm.[13] Therefore, the structural refinements were first carried out on the basis of the model of the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure. Table 1 lists the atomic coordinates and equivalent thermal parameters. The crystal data and the results of structural refinements are listed in Table 2. The small R factors indicate that the structure of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} is ThCr_{2}Si_{2} type. Compared with the lattice parameters of ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type SrNi_{2}Ge_{2} with the lattice parameters of a = 0.4188 and c = 1.0254 nm,[14] replacement of Ni with a larger atom Pd causes quite a large elongation of the a axis parameters, whereas the c axis parameters are almost the same. The same trend is observed for LaM_{2}Ge_{2} (_M_ = Ni and Pd). The lattice parameters of LaNi_{2}Ge_{2} are a = 0.4187 and c = 0.9918 nm,[14] whereas LaPd_{2}Ge_{2} shows a = 0.43669 and c = 1.0027 nm.[15]

### Superconducting properties

The diamagnetic signals are observed at 3.04 K for both modes with a 10%-90% transition width (\Delta T_{c}) of about 0.1 K. The as-melted SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} samples show a slightly higher _T_c of 3.10 K with a \Delta T_{c} of 0.15 K. The detail of the region in the vicinity of _T_c is shown in the inset. The magnitude of the magnetic shielding signal after being corrected for demagnetization effects is approximately equal to 100% of that estimated for perfect diamagnetism, while the magnitude of flux expulsion (Meissner effect) is 7% of that estimated for perfect diamagnetism. These indicate that the superconductivity is a bulk effect. Taking account of the existence of hysteresis observed between the signals in ZFC and FC modes, we conclude that the SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} is a type II superconductor.

Figure 3 shows the _M_(_H_) curves measured at various temperatures for SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}. The details of the same curves in the background region are shown in the inset. These curves are characteristic for type II superconductors. Figure 4 shows the _M_(_T_) curves measured for SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} at various magnetic fields. The details of the same curves in the vicinity of _T_c are also shown in the inset.

Figure 5 shows the electrical resistivity \rho as a function of temperature in magnetic fields. The resistivity decreases with decreasing temperature, showing metalliclike conductivity. From 300 to 30 K, the temperature-dependent resistivity curve shows a small negative curvature. Such a curvature is also observed for U_{3}Ni_{4}Si_{4}-type La_{3}M_{x}^{\prime}X_{4} (_M_^{\prime} = Ni and Pd, X = Si and Ge) superconductors consisting of the combination of structural units of AlB_{2}-type LaM^{\prime}X and ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type LaM_{x}^{\prime}X_{2} layers.[16, 17] The onset temperature of the transition in 0 Oe is 3.09 K and zero resistance is observed at 3.03 K.

  detail of the region in the vicinity of T_{c} is shown in the inset. The room-temperature resistivity, \rho(300 K), is approximately 30 \mu\Omega cm and the residual resistivity, \rho(res), just above T_{c} is 2.5 \mu\Omega cm. Therefore, the residual resistivity ratio is \rho(300 K)/\rho(res) = 12, indicating that the sample has a good quality. With increasing applied magnetic fields, the T_{c} decreases and zero resistance is no longer observed in fields above 600 Oe.

The apparent lower critical field (H_{c1}^{*}) was determined by low-field magnetization measurements with the SQUID magnetometer. H_{c1}^{*} at various temperatures was taken as the point of deviation of M(H) from the linear M-H behavior observed at low fields. The true lower critical field (H_{c1}) was obtained from the H_{c1}^{*} by applying the correction for the demagnetization factor. The H_{c1} as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 6. Fitting the formula H_{c1}=H_{c1}(0)[1 -(T/T_{c})^{2}], H_{c1}(0) = 180 Oe and T_{c}

  The upper critical field (H_{c2}) was estimated from both M(H) and M(T) curves. For the M(H) curves, the H_{c2} was determined from the point where the M(H) curves reach the background. For the M(T) curves, the H_{c2} was estimated, taking account of the onset point of superconducting transition of the M(T) curves. The H_{c2} estimated from these curves as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 7. The gradient -dH_{c2}/dT is estimated to be 0.84 and 0.83 kOe/K for H_{c2}^{H_{c2}M(T)} and H_{c2}^{M_{c2}T(T)} curves, respectively. These values are much lower than those of the same ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type (Ba, K)Fe_{2}As_{2} and ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-derivative borocarbides. The -dH_{c2}/dT of the (Ba, K)Fe_{2}As_{2} single crystal is 29 and 54 kOe/K for H\parallelc and H\perpc, respectively.[21] The borocarbides show the -dH_{c2}/dT value of 8 kOe/K.[18] On the other hand, the same ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type BaNi_{2}P_{2} single crystal with a T_{c} of 2.51 K shows the comparable -dH_{c2}/dT values of about 0.4 and 1 kOe/K for H\parallel\perpc, respectively.[20]

Linear extrapolation of the H_{c2}(T) curves obtained from the M(H) and M(T) curves gives H_{c2}^{H_{c2}M(0)}=2.6 kOe and H_{c2}^{M_{c2}T(0)}=2.4 kOe, respectively. On the other hand, assuming the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula H_{c2}^{\rm WHH(0)}=-0.697_{c}(dH_{c2}/dT)_{\rm rc2}[22]H_{c2}^{\rm WHH(0)} values of 1.8 and 1.7 kOe are obtained from H_{c2}^{M_{c2}(0)} and H_{c2}^{M_{c2}T(0)} curves, respectively. H_{c2}^{\rm oz}T(T) which is defined as the field where the 1% decrease in \rho at the superconducting transition of the \rho(T) curves is observed in Fig. 5 gives -dH_{c2}/dT =1.0 kOe/K and H_{c2}^{\rm WHH(0)}=2.1 kOe. In the following calculations, we have used intermediate H_{c2}^{\rm WHH(M-H)}(0) for H_{c2}(0) among these three values.

With the formula H_{c2}(0)=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi(0)^{2} (\Phi_{0} is the flux quantum), the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence length \xi(0) is estimated to be 43 nm. From H_{c2}(0) and \xi(0) the penetration depth, \lambda(0), is calculated to be 71 nm with the formula H_{c1}(0)=[\Phi_{0}/4\pi\lambda(0)^{2}]ln[\lambda(0)/\xi(0)]. The GL parameter, \kappa(0)[=\lambda(0)/\xi(0)], is 1.6. This value of the GL parameter is quite small. It is noted that LaPd_{2}Ge_{2}, obtained by the replacement of Sr with La in SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}, is a type I superconductor with a T_{c} of 1.12 K.[2] On the other hand, thermodynamic critical field [H_{c}(0)] is estimated to be 770 Oe, with the formula of H_{c}(0)=H_{c2}(0)/\,\gamma\,\kappa(0). Table 3 lists these measured and calculated superconducting properties for SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}.

## IV Conclusions

We have prepared ternary germanide SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} by arc melting. This is isostructural with the recently discovered ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type superconductors (Ba,Sr)_{1-x}(K,Cs)_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} with space group I4/mmm. The lattice parameters of SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} are a=0.440 88(2) and c=1.012 70(8) nm. dc magnetization and electrical resistivity measurements indicated that the SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} is a type II superconductor with a T_{c} of 3.04 K.
