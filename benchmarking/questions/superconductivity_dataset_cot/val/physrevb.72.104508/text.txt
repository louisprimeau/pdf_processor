###### Abstract

The physical properties of _An_-substituted (_An_ = U, Np) and _T_-substituted (_T_ = Fe, Rh, Ni) PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) have been studied by magnetization, specific heat, and electrical resistivity. In all cases, the superconducting critical parameters decrease with substitution and different trends emerge. Isoelectronic substitution is the least destructive for superconductivity. On the contrary, for nonisoelectronic substitution, the _T\({}_{c}\)_ decrease versus _c/a_ does not follow the trend observed in the cerium and plutonium isostructural compounds. Substituting Pu with actinides most dramatically affects the critical parameters. In particular, superconductivity is predicted to vanish in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) with 18% Np substitution, making the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism unlikely in a (Pu\({}_{1-x}\)Np\({}_{x}\))CoGa\({}_{5}\) system. The electron count in _An_7Ga\({}_{5}\) compounds appears as a general and plausible quantity to evaluate trends in the variation of the critical (_T\({}_{c}\)_, _H_z2(0)) and electronic (_g_) parameters.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity at 18.5 K in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\)[1] has raised a number of interesting questions pertinent to solid state physics; in particular, is the form of superconductivity unconventional or not? We have argued in a recent paper [2] that the strong correlation between the _c/a_ ratio and _T\({}_{c}\)_ in both the Pu and Ce 1:1:5 structures (compounds having the tetragonal HoCoGa\({}_{5}\) structure with a symmetry of P4/mmm) points to a basic similarity between the mechanism of superconductivity in these materials. Although that mechanism is not yet established, the fact that superconductivity is found only in Ce and Pu materials with this structure, and not, for example, in other (rare earths or U and Np) isostructural compounds, strongly suggests that it is not conventional.

The compounds UCoGa\({}_{5}\) and NpCoGa\({}_{5}\) are paramagnetic [3, 4, 5, 6] and antiferromagnetic, [7, 8] respectively. In UCoGa\({}_{5}\) the susceptibility is almost independent of temperature and the specific heat [5] shows that \(g\) = 21 mJmol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\). NpCoGa\({}_{5}\) is strongly magnetic with _T\({}_{N}\)_=47 K, showing an ordered moment of 0.82(4) \(\mu_{\rm B}\)/Np, less than 0.05 \(\mu_{\rm B}\) on the Co site and \(g\) = 64 mJmol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\). [7, 8] In all actinide-based AnCoGa\({}_{5}\) systems, band-structure calculations [9, 10, 11] have suggested that the 5\(f\) electrons are itinerant, that the actinide ion is in an approximate trivalent state, and that the 3\(d\) states are filled and below _E\({}_{F}\)_.

In this paper we continue the investigation of the superconductivity of PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) by studying the doping of the parent material (Pu\({}_{x}\)_An\({}_{1-x}\)_)(Co\({}_{x}\)_T\({}_{1-x}\)_)Ga\({}_{5}\) with small amounts of actinides (_An_ = U, Np) and different transition metals (_T_ = Fe and Ni). These dopings affect the electronic structure, as opposed to doping Co with Rh, both of which are nominally iso-electronic with ~7 \(d\) electrons in the transition metal \(d\) shell. We present magnetic and electronic parameters but the main goal and interest of the present paper is the evolution and trends of the superconductivity parameters.

## II Experimental

Polycrystalline ingots were synthesized by arc melting stoichiometric amounts of the constituent elements under an atmosphere of high purity argon on a water-cooled copper hearth, using a Zr getter. To ensure homogeneity, the arc-melted buttons were turned over and remelted three times. Weight losses were checked during the synthesis process and found to remain below 0.5%. For further heat treatment, the pellets were wrapped in tantalum foil, and annealed at 850 degC for one week under very high vacuum. The crystal structure and the purity of the polycrystalline samples obtained were then checked from x-ray powder diffraction data (Cu _K\(\alpha\)_ radiation) collected on a Bragg-Brentano D500 diffractometer. A significant amount of neighboring phases (An\({}_{2}\)TGa\({}_{8}\) and an unidentified hexagonal phase) were found in the sample with 10%Np substitution and also seen as traces in 10%Ni, 20%Fe, and 50% Rh samples. However, most of these 2:1:8 phases have been investigated separately and none were found to exhibit either superconductivity or magnetic order. The possible, but limited, impact of these impurity phases on the physical measurements is taken into account by the large error bars given for the parameters listed in Table 1. Note that the values of the most important parameters like the critical temperature or field are not affected by small amounts of impurity phases. The lattice parameters of all compounds (at room temperature) are given in Table 1.

All measurements were made on encapsulated polycrystalline samples, as described elsewhere. [12] DC-magnetization measurements were performed on a commercial SQUID magnetometer from 2 to 300 K in magnetic fields up to 7 T.

  The specific heat and electrical resistivity were measured on a commercial PPMS instrument within the temperature range 1.8-300 K and in magnetic fields up to 9 T.

All solid solutions investigated in this paper being based on PuCoGa5, they will, for convenience and clarity, be simply identified by the percentage of doping element, e.g., "10% Np" will refer to (Pu0.9Np0.1)CoGa5, 20%Fe to Pu(Co0.8Fe0.2)Ga5, etc.

## III Results

### Doping on actinide site, _An_

A sharp decrease to negative values of the zero-field-cooled magnetic susceptibility indicates the occurrence of superconductivity in the 10% U and Np compounds below \(T_{c}\)  8.4 K and \(T_{c}\)  7.2 K, respectively (Fig. 1). In a first approximation, the 10% U doped material is close to a perfect diamagnetism, whereas the susceptibility of the 10% Np reaches only ~5% of the "ideal" value of - \(\frac{1}{4}\pi\). This suggests that the 10% Np sample may contain nonsuperconducting phases. Indeed, the x-ray diffraction patterns show that the 10% U sample displays pure 1:1:5 phase, whereas the 10% Np sample contains non-negligible (roughly estimated around 30%) amounts of the 2:1:8 phase (Ho2CoGa8 type see, e.g., Ref. 13) and another, so far undetermined, phase.

The magnetization versus magnetic field (Fig. 2) shows a typical "butterfly" shape indicative of type-II superconductivity with pinning centers that trap the magnetic field vortices and allow superconductivity to survive in high magnetic fields, as observed in the pure PuCoGa51 and PuRhGa514 compounds. In both the 10% U and 10% Np compounds the fields \(H_{c}\) required to close the "butterfly" at \(T\) = 5 K are close to \(m\)0_H__c_  7 T and = 1 T, respectively. Using the slope of \(H_{c}\)(T) near \(T_{c}\) and the WHH approximation for the upper critical field at \(T\) = 0, _H__c_2(0) = -0.69 T\({}_{c}\)\(\partial\)H\({}_{c2}\)/\(\partial\)T, 15 we extrapolate \(m\)0_H__c_(0)  8.7 T and \(m\)0_H__c_(0) = 3.4 T, respectively. This may be compared to the \(m\)0_H__c_2(0)  74 T inferred for PuCoGa5 using resistivity measurements,1 or rather to \(m\)0H__c_(0)  31 T similarly inferred from magnetization loops. The critical field \(H_{c}\) measured by SQUID actually corresponds more closely to the irreversible field \(H_{c}\), which may be significantly lower than _H__c_2. It should also be mentionned that in favorable geometry, surface superconductivity may

In the normal state, the magnetic susceptibilities of 10% U and Np are intermediate between those of PuCoGa\({}_{5}\), UCoGa\({}_{5}\), and NpCoGa\({}_{5}\) (Fig. 3) and can be accounted for by a modified Curie-Weiss law:

\[\chi = \chi_{0} + \text{C}/(\text{T} \cdot \theta_{\text{p}})\]

The Curie constants thus obtained were renormalized according to the formula:[17]

\[C_{\text{renorm}} = (C \cdot \theta_{p}\chi_{0})^{2}/C\]

from which the effective moments were inferred. Doping with U makes the effective moment slightly decrease (Table I), whereas doping with Np barely raises it. These tendencies make sense as UCoGa\({}_{5}\) has no effective moment and NpCoGa\({}_{5}\) carries a twice higher effective moment than PuCoGa\({}_{5}\).

### Doping on transition-metal site, \(T\)

Previous substitutions of the cobalt site in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) have been performed only with the iso-electronic element Rh by mixing PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) and PuRhGa\({}_{5}\), both superconductors. The 50% Rh and 90% Rh show the onset of superconductivity at 15.5 and 10.2 K, respectively [Fig. 4(a)]. We have extended the study to nonisoelectronic elements by doping PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) with the two nearest neighbors of cobalt (3\(d^{7}\)), i.e., Fe(3\(d^{6}\)) and Ni(3\(d^{8}\)). The magnetic susceptibility of these new compounds are displayed in Fig. 4(b), showing the onset of superconductivity at 13.5, 10.0, 16.4 K, for 10% and 20% Fe and 10% Ni, respectively.

The resulting values of the susceptibilities below \(T_{c}\) are all rather close to perfect diamagnetism as shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The weaker susceptibility of PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) and 50%Rh can be explained by the measurement fields, 0.05 and 0.03 T, respectively, which are slightly above the critical field \(H_{c1}\). The 10%Ni, although measured at 0.001 T, also exhibits a slightly weaker susceptibility that may be indicative of a small amount of a nonsuperconducting impurity in the bulk.

  Figure 5 shows the magnetization loops of the transition-metal doped PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) samples. The "butterfly" shape is clearly observed in all compounds, indicative of a type-II superconductivity with pinning centers. Except for pure PuCoGa\({}_{5}\), the magnetization maximum at low fields (when decreasing the field) is very sharp. However, the maximum magnetization \(M_{\max}\) (at \(H\)=0) and area within the butterfly are much weaker than in pure PuCoGa\({}_{5}\): Substituting 10% of Ni or Fe decreases \(M_{\max}\) by one order of magnitude. This indicates that flux pinning of PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) in the mixed state is much larger than in Pu(Co\({}_{1-x}\)T\({}_{x}\))Ga\({}_{5}\) solid solutions. It is interesting that doping with a transition metal appears to suppress flux pinning so strongly, as pinning is thought to arise from defects created by Pu decay\({}^{\dagger}\) that is independent of the transition metal.

In the normal state, similar to the (Pu\({}_{1-x}\)\(M_{n}\))CoGa\({}_{5}\) compounds, the magnetic susceptibility of all Pu(Co\({}_{1-x}\)\(T_{x}\))Ga\({}_{5}\) compounds, except 20%Fe, obey a modified Curie-Weiss law (Fig. 6). The values of the effective moment are listed in Table I. Rh and Ni substitution tend to decrease the effective moment, whereas Fe substitution increases it.

The specific heat (Cp) data confirm the occurrence of bulk superconductivity, with critical temperatures in good agreement with those inferred from magnetic susceptibility, in all Pu(Co\({}_{1-x}\)\(T_{x}\))Ga\({}_{5}\) compounds (Figs. 7 and 8). The values of specific heat (Sommerfeld coefficient) \(\gamma\) were estimated by the linear extrapolation of \(C_{p}\)/\(T\)=\(\gamma\)+\(\beta\)\(T^{2}\) from the normal state to \(T\)=0 K. However, this simple law is valid at low temperatures (\(T\)\(\ll\)\(\theta_{\rm D}\)). Such a fit becomes questionable for temperatures above \(\sim\)10 K. Nevertheless, it seems that substituting Co by Fe, Ni, or Rh generally increases the \(\gamma\) value compared to pure PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) (Table I).

Finally, the resistivity measurements also confirm the occurrence of superconductivity in all Pu(Co\({}_{1-x}\)\(T_{x}\))Ga\({}_{5}\) compounds and allow a higher accuracy in the determination of

As mentioned in the previous section, the extrapolated \(H_{c2}\)(0) values (from the WHH approximation) inferred from resistivity are significantly higher than the values of \(H_{c}\) inferred from magnetization: \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}\)(0) = 70 T ( \(\mu_{0}H_{c}\)(0) = 21 T from magnetization), 28 T (6.8 T), 22 T (9.1 T), 64 T (15.4 T), 40 T (4.8 T), 69 T (11.5 T) for 50% and 90% Rh, 10% and 20% Fe, and 10% Ni, respectively.

## IV Discussion

From the crystal-chemistry point of view, one can already observe that solid solutions can be prepared by diluting on the actinide site as well as on the transition metal site. This behavior is significant on the stability of this crystal structure. However, when looking at the lattice parameter variation versus concentration, in all these solid solutions, Vegard's law is not fulfilled. This observation indicates that steric effects are not the only parameters involved in the stability of this crystal structure, but electronic structure influences the bonding.

The variation of the critical temperature with substitution is represented in Fig. 10. It is clear that the substitution of the actinide affects more dramatically the critical temperature, which suggests that the 5\(f\) electrons are directly involved in superconductivity, as expected from theoretical calculations.[9, 10, 11] A rough linear extrapolation anticipates that \(T_{c}\) would vanish with \(\sim\)18 % Np or \(\sim\)20% U. This rapid disappearance of the superconductivity makes the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism unlikely in (Pu\({}_{x}\)Np\({}_{1-x}\))CoGa\({}_{5}\), as the magnetic order observed in NpCoGa\({}_{5}\) may not survive at such low Np concentrations. Substituting the transition metal appears less destructive for superconductivity in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\). We anticipate superconductivity to survive up to 40% Fe and an even higher Ni substitution. Finally, isoelectronic Rh substitution has only a small effect on \(T_{c}\), as pure PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) is also a superconductor. These studies suggest that integrity of the Pu sublattice is more important for superconductivity than is periodicity of the \(d\)-electron elements.

The striking similarity of the properties between Pu\(T\)Ga\({}_{5}\) and Ce\(T\)In\({}_{5}\) has been recently demonstrated by the linear correlation in both systems between the critical temperature and the ratio of the tetragonal lattice parameters c/a.[2] Figure 11 shows the \(T_{c}\)=\(f\)(\(c/a\)) plot extended to the solid solutions studied in the present paper. It clearly shows that these solid solutions do not fall on the same line as the Pu(Co\({}_{1-x}\)Rh\({}_{x}\))Ga\({}_{5}\) materials. Their \(T_{c}\)s decrease much more rapidly with \(c/a\). However, it seems that a linear relationship between \(T_{c}\) and \(c/a\) still applies individually for each series, with a steeper slope for actinide doping. The tendency for Pu(Co\({}_{1-x}\)Ni\({}_{x}\))Ga\({}_{5}\) is less clear because only one substitution (10%) is available for this compound and it falls somewhere in between the other transition-metal doped systems, within an error bar distance of both slopes.

It is important to notice that Rh doping is iso-electronic (Co and Rh lie on the same column of the periodic table)

Figure 8: Specific heat of 10% Fe (+), 20% Fe (\(\times\)), and 10% Ni (\(\triangledown\)).

  whereas Fe and Ni, as well as actinide-ion doping have different electron counts than PuCoGa\({}_{5}\). To illustrate the possible significance, key physical parameters are plotted as a function of the electron count in Fig. 12. Figure 12(a) shows a spectacular concentration of all \(An\)\(T\)Ga\({}_{5}\) superconducting compounds in a narrow band at 32\(\pm\)0.2 electrons, whereas all compounds outside of this band (i.e., with a different electron count) are not superconducting. A similar trend is observed when plotting the critical field \(H_{c2}\)(0). It is tempting to use these simple graphs to tentatively identify possible new superconducting compounds and/or interesting solid solutions. However, PuIrGa\({}_{5}\)[18] and NpNiGa\({}_{5}\),[19] for example, are iso-electronic to PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) but so far no superconductivity was observed in these compounds.

The Sommerfeld specific heat coefficient \(\gamma\) shows an approximately linear dependence [Fig. 12(b)] versus the electron count and increases from a low 21 mJmol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\)(UCoGa\({}_{5}\)) up to a strongly enhanced 195 mJmol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\)(PuNiGa\({}_{5}\)). The idea that adding electrons to the system increases the electronic density of states is plausible, although a linear dependence seems surprisingly simple. PuCoGa\({}_{5}\), the 10% Fe, and the 50% Rh all slightly "deviate" from this approximately linear variation. However, these compounds are, with the 10% Ni, those with the highest \(T_{c}\)s and consequently the \(\gamma\) coefficients are extrapolated from high temperature, which limits their accuracy. The \(\gamma\) values of these compounds, estimated from the extrapolation to zero temperature of the simple \(C_{p}/T\)= \(\gamma\)+\(\beta\)T\({}^{2}\) law, which is known to be questionable for temperatures above \(\sim\)10 K, are not fully correct. Another way to estimate the \(\gamma\) coefficient is to use the phonon contribution of the nonsuperconducting and nonmagnetic UCoGa\({}_{5}\) homologue and fit the difference of \(C_{p}(T)\) with PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) or other related compounds, over the whole available temperature range above \(T_{c}\) by the electronic contribution \(\gamma\)T. Indeed, this method yields \(\gamma\) = 130 mJmol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\) for PuCoGa\({}_{5}\), placing it right on the linear \(\gamma\)=\(f\)(electron count) dependence and 180 mJmol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\) for 10% Fe, shifting it from below to above the linear dependence. The \(\gamma\) values determined this way for the remaining compounds agree rather well with the low-temperature \(C_{p}/T\)= \(\gamma\)+ \(\beta\)T\({}^{2}\) law extrapolating method.

Although uranium possesses a potential magnetic moment arising from its unfilled 5\(f\) shell, it may be considered as a nonmagnetic impurity in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) as the UCoGa\({}_{5}\) analogue is a temperature independent paramagnet. The fact that a nonmagnetic impurity affects the critical temperature [20] almost as dramatically as the Np _magnetic_ impurity indicates that the superconductivity in the PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) host is probably unconventional. Note that although the significant amount of impurity phase in the 10%Np compound mentioned before does alter the superconducting volume fraction of the sample, it is expected that the critical temperature of the intrinsic superconducting phase is unchanged.

The influence of magnetic impurities on the \(T_{c}\) of a superconductor is described by the Abrikosov and Gorkov pair breaking theory, [21] which considers a term arising from exchange interaction between conduction electron spin and localized impurity spin, leading to a finite lifetime \(\tau_{\rm AG}\) of the electron pairs:

\[1/\tau_{\rm AG}=xN(E_{F})2\,\pi(J_{\rm ex}/2)^{2}S(S+1)\]

where \(x\) is the concentration of magnetic impurities, \(N(E_{F})\) is the single spin density of states at the Fermi surface, \(J_{\rm ex}\) is

Open symbols denote compounds that do not show superconductivity down to the lowest experimentally achieved temperatures and solid points correspond to compounds in which superconductivity is found and discussed in this paper.

  the exchange integral, and \(S\) is the spin of the impurity. For low concentrations of impurities, the critical temperature decreases linearly as :

\[\Delta T_{c}(x) = T_{c}(x = 0) - T_{c}(x) = (\pi\hbar/4k_{B}\tau_{\text{AG}})\]

For a given impurity, such as Fe, we can evaluate the relative changes in \(T_{c}\) expected from these relationships by assuming that _J_ex depends weakly on \(x\) and that N(_E_F) is proportional to the measured Sommerfeld coefficient. With these assumptions and taking values of \(T_{c}\)(_x_) and _g_(_x_) for 10% and 20% Fe from Table 1, the Abrikosov-Gorkov relations predict D_T__c_(0.2)/D_T__c_(0.1)=3.2; whereas, experimentally, this ratio is 1.7. If this discrepancy is real, it suggests that Fe substitutions on the transition-metal site do not break Cooper pairs as effectively as expected by theory.

We also make the following qualitative observations:

The pair breaking parameter 1/_T_AG increases with the doping \(x\), which is observed experimentally.

The critical temperature \(T_{c}\) is expected to decrease linearly with 1/_t_AG, thus quasi-linearly with \(x\) if _N_(_E_F) does not depend too much on \(x\). A quasi-linear experimental \(T_{c}\) decrease is observed for dopings where we have at least 3 points (Fe, Rh). This validates our proposed linear extrapolations to _T__c_=0.

The Abrikosov and Gorkov formula can also account for the \(T_{c}\) decrease induced by nonmagnetic impurities if the pairing states have non-_s_-wave symmetry.22 As mentioned above, U and Np substitution have, neglecting potential impact of the impurity phase in the 10%Np sample, comparable effect on the \(T_{c}\) of PuCoGa5 and this further suggests that non-_s_-wave symmetry occurs in this compound.

As discussed earlier in this section, electron count and changes in _c_/_a_ ratios also strongly influence \(T_{c}\) and compromise an unambiguous interpretation of pair breaking effects by chemical substitutions.

## V Conclusion

When substituting Pu with actinides (U, Np) or Co with transition metals (Fe, Ni, Rh) in PuCoGa5, the critical parameters decrease and different trends emerge. Some of these trends have to be taken with care when few experimental points are available and in particular "magnetic" parameters that may be influenced by impurity phases observed in some compounds (see experimental section). However, the present paper is focused on superconducting properties and these are not affected greatly by nonsuperconducting impurity phases and this allows solid conclusions to be drawn. We have adopted the "electron count" as suggested by Maehira _et al._10 and found that many parameters appear to be dependent on this quantity. This, in turn, implies that a description in terms of itinerant electron states may be appropriate for these materials.9-11 Iso-electronic substitution is the least destructive for superconductivity. On the contrary, for nonisoelectronic substitution, the \(T_{c}\) decrease versus _c_/_a_ does not follow the trend observed in the iso-electronic doping of cerium or plutonium compounds of this type.2 The most dramatic effects happen when Pu is substituted suggesting that the 5\(f\) electrons are crucial in driving the superconductivity. In particular, superconductivity is expected to vanish in PuCoGa5 with approximately 20% Np. Further investigation of the (Pu1-xNp)CoGa5 system with higher Np content would be worthwhile to check where the superconductivity is destroyed and where magnetism appears.
