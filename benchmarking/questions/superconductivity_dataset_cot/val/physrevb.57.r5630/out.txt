###### Abstract

We have measured the pressure effect on the superconducting transition temperature _T_c of samples of Hg1-_x_Au_Ba2Ca2Cu3O8+_x_. Even for a high degree of overdoping _T_c increases with applied pressure, implying that it is not only the change of charge transfer between the reservoir blocks and the copper oxide planes that enhances _T_c . We show here instead that the change of the proximity effect induced by the decrease of the distance between copper oxide blocks can account for the increase of _T_c below 10 GPa. [S0163-1829(98)50110-5]

Among all the high-temperature cuprates, the mercury system is the one that presents the most intriguing increase of the superconducting transition temperature, _T_c , both for its rate of increase and for the attained values, which correspond to the highest ever observed _T_c . The first pressure[1, 2] measurements on the Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O system in hydrostatic piston-cylinder vessels showed that _T_c increased under compression at a rate of 1.7 K/GPa, a strong rate that would correspond to an underdoped sample. However, as soon as optimally doped samples became available, it became evident that this rather strong rate continued to the highest pressures reaching 153 K, 3 158 K, 4 and finally going through a maximum near 164 K (Ref. 5) at around 30 GPa. Most of the other groups that performed measurements subsequently confirmed this strong increase. 6-10 However, in spite of the efforts to comprehend this phenomenon in order to determine the best route to stabilize the observed high _T_c's at ambient pressure, the key to its understanding is still lacking. One still missing piece of information is the high-pressure behavior of overdoped samples of the three layer mercury cuprate, that may clarify the relative importance of charge transfer in the increase of _T_c under pressure. In this communication we present measurements on overdoped (Hg1-_x_Au_x_)-1223 samples that furnish new light on this issue.

The sample preparation and characterization of the Hg1-_x_Au_Ba2Ca2Cu3O8+_x_ samples have been described in detail in Ref. 11. The compounds were synthesized by using the high-pressure-high-temperature technique in a belt-type apparatus. Precursors with nominal composition Ba2Ca2-_x_Cu2O8 were prepared from a mixture of oxides and nitrates, followed by annealing at temperatures between 900 and 925 degC for 72 h under an oxygen flow. The precursors were then mixed with an appropriate amount of gold and mercury oxides, and submitted to the high-pressure-high-temperature treatment at 1.8 GPa and 950 degC for 1.6 h. The samples obtained were characterized by x-ray powder diffraction, high-resolution electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis using a Philips CM300 in the TEM.

High-pressure resistance measurements (HPR) were performed with the Bridgman sintered diamond anvil configuration used in Ref. 4 in quasihydrostatic conditions, on powder extracted from ceramic samples. Steatite was used as the pressure transmission medium and pyrophillite as a gasket. Pressure was estimated by means of the superconducting transition of lead and the resistance was measured using a standard four contact dc technique. The sample's current densities ranged from 0.1 to 10 A/cm2. We show in Fig. 1 typical resistivity temperature dependencies measured on our samples. Possibly due to deterioration during grinding, the superconductivity only percolates completely at low temperatures. Some of the samples also showed two distinct superconducting transitions, both in the susceptibility and resistivity measurements, which correspond to gold doping inhomogeneities. This behavior was retained by the powder that was introduced in the pressure cell. We present in Fig. 2 the pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature for several samples of different nominal concentration. _T_c was determined by the peak of the derivative of the resistance as a function of temperature. It is interesting to note the increase of _T_c with pressure, even for the highly overdoped ones.

We can analyze our results in the light of a straightforward formulation of the change of _T_c with pressure[12, 13, 14] supposing that we have essentially two effects: the variation of  carrier transfer dn/dP and an intrinsic T_{c} change independent of charge transfer, dT_{c}^{\prime}/dP. Let us assume a linear dependence on pressure for n(P) and considering the general expression T_{c}(n)\!=\!T_{c}^{\rm max}(P)[1\!-\!\eta(n_{\rm op}\!-\!n)^{2}] we arrive at the following equations for T_{c}(n,P):

\[T_{c}(n,P)\!=\!T_{c}(n,0)\!+\!\alpha(n)P\!+\!\beta(n)P^{2},\] (1)

with

\[\alpha(n)\!=\!dT_{c}^{\prime}/dP\!+\!2\;\eta T_{c}^{\rm max}dn/  Another important structural variation [22] under pressure is the following: the separation between the three CuO_{2} planes of the same blocks changes less than 1% while the distance between different three layered CuO_{2} blocks varies almost 10% between ambient pressure and \sim10 GPa. We can consider our compound as an intrinsic multilayer composed of three superconducting (_s_) CuO_{2} blocks and metallic (_n_) HgO reservoirs (according to band calculations), of thickness _d_{x}_\sim6.25 A and _d_{x}_\sime-6.25 A, respectively. Within this picture, and considering that pressure-induced charge transfer is low, the principal effect of pressure is to reduce _d_{n}_. The variation of _d_{n}_ with pressure is mainly due to the variation of the lattice parameter **c**.

In a simplified proximity effect framework, the superconducting pairs sample an effective attractive potential (_V_eff) which is the spatial average of the potentials in each side of the _s_/_n_ interface. Then, according to the early theories of Cooper, [25] Werthammer, [26] and deGennes, [27] we can calculate the superconductor transition temperature (_T_{c}_) using a BCS formula.

\[T_{c} = 1.14\,\theta\,\exp\biggl{[}-\frac{1}{[N(0)V]_{\rm eff}}\,\biggr{]}\] (4) \[= 1.14\,\theta\,\exp\biggl{[}-\frac{d_{x}\!+\!d_{n}}{d_{x}\![N(0)V] _{x}}\,\biggr{]},\]

where \theta is the characteristic energy of the virtual bosons exchanged by the paired electrons (\Theta_{\rm Debye} for electron-phonon superconductivity) and N(0) is the electronic density at the Fermi level.

It is assumed that in the nonsuperconducting layer [N(0)V]_{n}\!=\!0 and that the superconducting (\xi_{s}) and the metallic (\xi_{n}) coherence length are larger than _d_{s}_ and _d_{n}_, respectively. From superlattices experimental results, the limit \xi_{n}\!\!>\!d_{n} is clearly verified. [28] Although the measured [29]\xi_{ab}\sim20 A satisfies this criterion, \xi_{c} can be four times smaller. In the limit where _d_{x}\!\!>\!\xi_{s}_ and _d_{x}\!\!>\!\xi_{n}_, _T_{c}_ could also be described [27] by an exponential law of the form _T_{c}\!=\!T_{\rm lim}_+A\cdot\exp(-Bd_{n}), with _A,B\!>\!0_. Thus, the expressions obtained for both limits indicate a net enhancement of _T_{c}_ with pressure.

As the pressure dependence of the **c** parameter has been measured precisely, **c(P)** can be fitted [30] using known equations of state; we find then from Eq. (4) for the transition temperature as a function of pressure

\[T_{c}(P)=1.14\,\theta(P)\exp\biggl{[}-\frac{c(P)[N(0)V]_{x}}{6.25}\,\biggr{]},\] (5)

which can also be expressed as

\[\ln\biggl{[}\frac{T_{c}(P)}{T_{c}(0)}\,\biggr{]}=-\,\frac{[N(0)V]_{x}}{6.25}\,[ c(P)\!-\!c(0)],\] (6)

assuming as unimportant the pressure variations of the characteristic energy \theta, the superconducting interaction V, and the electronic density at the Fermi level N(0). Band structure calculations [21] in the Hg-1223 compound are in accordance with the latter assumption as they show a very small variation of N(0) with pressure.

We show in Fig. 3 data from different groups together with the fit from Eq. (6). The agreement is excellent with only one parameter, A = (1.00\div 0.02)/6.25. At pressures higher than 10 GPa (not shown in the figure [31]) all the samples follow curves lower than the one calculated from expression (6), and the behavior becomes very sample dependent. A detailed analysis of the published experimental data shows that, as expected, the data obtained in hydrostatic apparatus follow a more systematic behavior. We show in Fig. 4 that the _one parameter fit_ of Eq. (6) also agrees accurately with these data _for two decades_ in the pressure range.

Figure 4: Logarithmic plot of the one parameter fit of expression (6) to the data of Refs. [6] and [9] obtained in hydrostatic conditions showing the excellent accord obtained for two decades in the pressure range.

Figure 3: Comparison of the one parameter fit of expression (6) to the normalized _T_{c}_â€™s obtained by different groups [3, 4, 5, 6] on Hg-1223.

  We have thus shown that the large T_{c} increase observed in Hg-1223 materials can be just the result of an improved coupling between CuO_{2} blocks induced by the contraction under pressure of the reservoir Hg layers. According to this conclusion, in order to stabilize at ambient pressure the high T_{c} observed in Hg-1223 under pressure, chemical substitutions should be aimed essentially at reducing the separation between the CuO_{2} blocks, without altering the CuO_{2} layers.
