24 April  pressure cell was inserted into a \({}^{4}\)He dewar that allowed the control of temperature between room temperature and 1.2 K. The temperature below 45 K was measured by a germanium resistor built into the pressure clamp close to the sample position. The inductance was measured with an LR 700 mutual inductance bridge (Linear Research) at a frequency of 19 Hz.

The inductance \(I(T)\) measured at different pressures is shown in Fig. 1 (for clarity not all sets of acquired data are shown). The superconducting transition is well resolved and the onset of diamagnetism causes the decrease of the inductance signal below \(T_{c}\). The vertical drop of \(I(T)\) close to 7 K in Fig. 1 indicates the diamagnetic signal from the superconducting transition of the lead manometer and it was used for pressure determination. With increasing pressure the superconducting transition of the Na0.35CoO2\(\cdot\) yH2O powder shifts to lower temperature and the transition becomes slightly sharper. It is remarkable that the shape and the overall drop of the susceptibility curves do not change appreciably with pressure which indicates that the sample is stable at the applied hydrostatic pressure. There is no sign of a possible chemical decomposition or loss of water during the experiments. After acquiring the highest pressure data the pressure was almost completely released (a residual pressure of 0.04 GPa was measured) and the susceptibility curve was found in good agreement with the ambient pressure data taken at the start of the experiments. These data are marked by filled squares in Fig. 1. This again shows that the sample is stable and the superconducting properties are reversible under hydrostatic pressure. The \(T_{c}(p)\) as estimated from the onset of the diamagnetic signal (see the inset of Fig. 1) is displayed in Fig. 2. For low pressure the change of \(T_{c}\) is relatively small. With increasing pressure the \(T_{c}\) decreases faster resulting in a nonlinear dependence \(T_{c}(p)\) as shown in Fig. 2. The solid line is a fit of the data to a parabolic pressure dependence, \(T_{c}(p)\) = 4.68\(-\)0.0047\(p\)\(-\) 0.1839\({}^{2}\) (\(T_{c}\) in K and \(p\) in GPa). At the highest pressure of this experiment (1.53 GPa) the superconducting transition dropped to 4.2 K. Extrapolating the parabolic dependence to \(T_{c}\) = 0 yields a critical pressure of \(p_{c}\) = 5 GPa. The recovery of \(T_{c}\) after pressure release is indicated by the filled square in Fig. 2 (in contrast to the open circles denoting data estimated within the increasing pressure cycle). It should be noted that in the present experiments the pressure medium was frozen at the superconducting transition temperature. This may result in deviations from pure hydrostatic conditions, and small pressure gradients throughout the sample space could be expected. Any pressure medium, even He gas at elevated pressure, will solidify at these low temperatures. In order to check on possible pressure gradients we have evaluated the width of the diamagnetic drop of the ac susceptibility in passing the superconducting transition of the lead manometer. The cooling speed was electronically controlled as low as 0.01 K/min. The width of the lead transition (as measured between the 90% and 10% drop of the susceptibility) was even at the highest pressure still below 0.01 K and only slightly larger than the zero pressure value of 0.008 K. If the small difference is attributed to a pressure gradient across the volume of the lead sample the inhomogeneity is less than 0.005 GPa at the maximum pressure of 1.6 GPa. With the Na0.35CoO2\(\cdot\) yH2O samples the linear dimension being about ten times the size of the lead, the possible pressure gradients are still small and should not affect the results significantly.

A negative pressure coefficient of \(T_{c}\) is frequently observed in low- as well as high-\(T_{c}\) compounds. In low-\(T_{c}\) (i.e., BCS-like, phonon-mediated) superconductivity the negative pressure shift of \(T_{c}\) can be explained by a decrease of the electron-phonon coupling constant, \(\lambda\). \(\lambda\) is proportional to the electronic density of states (DOS) and to the inverse of the average square of the phonon frequency. The application of pressure usually results in an increase of the phonon fre

The superconducting transition temperature was estimated from the onset of the diamagnetic signal, as indicated by the arrow in the inset. The sequence of pressure application follows the values listed in the figure. The filled squares denote the data set acquired after pressure was released.

  quency (phonon "hardening" effect) and, in many instances, in a decrease of the DOS. Both effects lead to a decrease of \(T_{c}\) , as was recently discussed, for example, in MgB\({}_{2}\).[8] The high-\(T_{c}\) cuprate superconductors exhibit both positive as well as negative pressure coefficients, depending on the compound and the doping state. For some hole-doped copper oxides a negative \(dT_{c}/dp\) was reported in the overdoped regime and partially attributed to a pressure-induced charge transfer, but it was also shown that this charge transfer is not the only factor affecting the pressure shift of \(T_{c}\) (for an extensive discussion, see Ref. 9). Na\({}_{0.35}\)CoO\({}_{2}\cdot y\)H\({}_{2}\)O is, however, an electron-doped system. This has to be taken into account if the present data are compared with the high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates. For electron-doped cuprates, e.g., Sm\({}_{1.88}\)Ce\({}_{0.12}\)CuO\({}_{4-y}\) , the pressure coefficient of \(T_{c}\) was found to be negative for a large number of systems with different chemical compositions and (electron) dopings.[9, 10] Thereby, a universal relation between the relative pressure coefficient, \(d\ln T_{c}/dp\), and \(T_{c}\) was proposed.[10] According to this relation the pressure coefficient for a sample with \(T_{c}\) = 4.7 K should be of the order of \(-\)0.1 to \(-\)0.15 GPa\({}^{-1}\). The \(T_{c}\)-\(p\) relation shown in Fig. 2 is nonlinear; however, estimating the average pressure change of \(T_{c}\) yields a value of \(d\ln T_{c}/dp\) = \(-\)0.07 GPa\({}^{-1}\), and calculating the slope of \(T_{c}(p)\) at the high pressure end of the graph we get \(d\ln T_{c}/dp\) = \(-\)0.1 GPa\({}^{-1}\). These values are in fair agreement with the typical pressure coefficient of an electron-doped high-\(T_{c}\) superconductor with a similar ambient pressure \(T_{c}\) .

In the discussion of the pressure effects the lattice anisotropy has to be considered since even hydrostatic pressure may result in different compression ratios along the main crystallographic directions. In optimally doped YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\), for example, the \(dT_{c}/dp\) varies in sign and magnitude for compression along \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) axes, resulting in a very small overall pressure shift of \(T_{c}\) under hydrostatic pressure conditions.[9] The lattice anisotropy in Na\({}_{0.35}\)CoO\({}_{2}\cdot y\)H\({}_{2}\)O is significant due to the huge expansion of the \(c\) axis after intercalation of water and the compression is expected to be anisotropic as well. High pressure x-ray investigations can distinguish the compression of the \(a\) and \(c\) axes and are therefore highly desirable. For the current discussion we assume that the two-dimensionality and the expansion of the \(c\) axis by intercalation of water in Na\({}_{0.35}\)CoO\({}_{2}\cdot y\)H\({}_{2}\)O is the key to understanding the superconductivity (this is at least assumed in all previous publications).[1, 2, 3, 4] Then it is natural to expect that a pressure induced decrease of the \(c\)-axis length results in a suppression of the superconducting state. However, the effects of in-plane compression are not clear and need to be investigated separately. Uniaxial pressure experiments using single crystals of Na\({}_{0.35}\)CoO\({}_{2}\cdot y\)H\({}_{2}\)O (not currently available) can help to separate the different contributions. A pressure induced charge transfer to the CoO\({}_{2}\) layers (as discussed for the cuprate superconductors) is unlikely as long as the intercalated water molecules remain neutral and the valence of the Na ions is +1. The nonlinear decrease of \(T_{c}\) observed in our investigation is equally unusual and interesting. It may suggest the possible existence of large dispersion in the energy spectrum of the compound near its Fermi surface.

In conclusion, we have investigated the dependence of the superconducting \(T_{c}\) of Na\({}_{0.35}\)CoO\({}_{2}\cdot y\)H\({}_{2}\)O upon hydrostatic pressure up to 1.6 GPa. The pressure coefficient is negative and \(T_{c}(p)\) shows a strong nonlinearity. The sign and magnitude of the relative pressure coefficient are compatible with similar data of electron-doped cuprates. Our results indicate that the superconductivity in this compound may originate from the apparent two dimensionality of the CoO\({}_{2}\) planes similar to the CuO\({}_{2}\) layers of the electron-doped copper oxides.
