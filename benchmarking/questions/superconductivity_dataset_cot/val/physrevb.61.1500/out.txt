###### Abstract

We performed tunneling experiments on single crystals of hole-doped two-leg ladders (SrCa)10Cu17O29 with T_{c}=75 K and, for reference purposes, on textured bulk samples of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (Bi2212). Point-contact and break-junction (Bi2212 only) junction configurations were used. The point-contact junctions, both superconductor-insulator-normal-metal and superconductor-normal-metal, were using Ag counterelectrodes. In all experiments the tunneling direction was along Cu2O3 planes (for the ladders) and CuO2 planes (for Bi2212). The recorded tunneling conductance spectra were reproducible with sharp, well-defined energy-gap structures. All junctions exhibited a pronounced zero-bias conductance peak disappearing at the critical temperature. Experimental results are consistent with the formation of zero-energy Andreev bound states at the surface of the superconductors and d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}-wave symmetry of the order parameter D in both compounds.

## I Introduction

After the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity much interest was invested in low-dimensional quantum spin systems, including the so-called spin-ladder systems [1] of ((M_{1-x}M_{x}^{\prime})2Cu2O3)_{m}(CuO2)_{n} type (designated further on as \Lambda_{m/n}), where M stands for alkaline earth metal and M^{\prime} for trivalent metal. These materials consist of alternate planes containing Cu2O3 two-leg ladders and single CuO2 chains separated by M-M^{\prime} layers. It has been shown theoretically that a two-leg spin ladder suitably doped may become superconducting with a d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}-wave symmetry. [1, 2, 3] Superconductivity was observed experimentally in some ladder compounds. The transition to superconducting state was observed at ambient pressure in single crystals of the (M_{2}Cu2O3)5(CuO2) \sigmaA57 compound, [4, 5] while the samples of SrCa14-xCa2O41.84 (x = 0.4 and x = 2.5) were superconducting at 3 - 4.5 GPa at 9 - 12 K. [6, 7] No attempt was made in these experiments to determine the symmetry of the order parameter.

In this paper we report on the results of tunneling and Andreev reflection spectroscopy of the energy gap in the bismuth-doped single crystals of composition (Ca5.84Sr4.02Bi0.14)Cu15.84O29, a superconductor with T_{c}\,\! for 16 h, compressed again, and finally annealed at T = 830 degC for 14 h in order to obtain a well pronounced texture.

Superconductor-normal-metal (S-N) (Andreev) and superconductor-insulator-normal-metal (S-I-N) (tunnel) junctions with silver N counterelectrodes were fabricated by two methods. The first, used for Bi samples, was based on pressing a fine silver powder into the ceramic material. The powder composed of particles with d = 3 \mum diameter was spread over the surface of the ceramic sample and fixed with a drop of silicon varnish. The sample was then subjected to hydrostatic pressure of up to 15 kbar. From Sharvin's formula [11] for the point-contact resistance R_{N} = 4_ \rho_l_/3 \pi_a_2, where we assume Ag resistivity r  1 \mu\Omega cm and the mean free path l ~ 0.1 \mum, we estimate the resultant point-contact radius to be a  1000 A.

The second method was used for the ladder samples and relied on baking the silver powder smeared on the sample surface. First the low-resistance voltage and current contact pads were prepared by baking the silver powder at 500 - 600 degC for 2 h in air. Then the powder was spread over a small spot at the intended junction location and baked at 400 - 450 degC for 40 - 60 min in air. Leads were attached to the junction spot by a splash of indium solder. The outer diameter of such a junction was 1 - 1.5 mm, while the area of the spectroscopic S-N microjunction estimated from Sharvin's formula is much smaller, about 10 \mum^{2}. Only a single S-N contact resulted from both described methods.

Superconductor-insulator-superconductor (S-I-S) junctions were prepared as "break-junctions," a form which is particularly appropriate for the study of high-temperature superconductors. [12] Superconducting gap features and their temperature dependence can be obtained in this configuration with high stability and reproducibility, and the peaks in tunneling conductance allow direct measurement of 2 \Delta. To prepare such junctions, the Bi2212 sample bars were glued with silicon varnish to a flexible steel plate. The external surface of the sample except for the contact pads was also covered by a 0.5-mm-thick layer of this varnish. After polymerizing, the sample-plate assembly became a solid unit. To form a break junction, the steel substrate was bent until the wafer was broken (without breaking the varnish coat). Then the external force was released and the substrate returned to the initial position.

The microjunctions formed this way inside the sample, were--as witnessed by their _I-V_ characteristics--either of the tunneling type with R_{N} ~ 50 - 100 \Omega, or of the S-C-S type, where C stands for constriction, with Andreev conductivity (R_{N} ~ 1 - 5 \Omega). As a rule these junctions exhibited a crisp singularity at _eV_ = \Delta, typical of well defined single junctions. Rarely faulty (multiple) junctions were obtained with smeared singularity indicating a variation of break angle with respect to crystal planes, but such samples were eliminated from further investigations. The investigated junctions were highly stable and their conductance could be repeatedly measured in the temperature range from 4.2 to 350 K. The varnish coating plays in the described fabrication method a very important role by protecting the ceramic compound from degradation and preventing mechanical instabilities. Because thin (_D_  0.1 mm) highly textured ceramic bars are employed, the junction is formed from a single microcrystal (_d_ ~ 10 \mum) and its geometry is favorable for probing in-plane tunneling characteristics.

According to Ref. [10], the atomic force and scanning electron microscopy of cleaved surfaces of Bi2212 crystals reveal broad flat regions separated by large cleavage steps. The surface roughness of the flat regions was found to be approximately 15 A (corresponding to the distance between BiO layers). The large cleavage steps were several mm apart and typically 1 -10 \mum high. We assume that in our case the situation was similar and the tunneling was realized predominantly in the direction of base CuO_{2} planes, with the barrier roughly perpendicular to these planes. This assertion is confirmed by the comparison of the obtained experimental _dI/dV_ versus V curves with the theory of tunneling spectroscopy of _d_-wave superconductors (see below). We found that the angle \alpha between the normal vector to the junction interface and the CuO_{2} plane of the microcrystal was small, \alpha \leq 10deg. The cross section of a typical microjunction was about 0.1 \times 0.1 \mum^{2}.

The differential conductance _dI/dV_ as a function of voltage V was recorded using standard lock-in techniques [13] with a small ac modulation of 10 mV superimposed on a slowly varying bias voltage applied to the sample. Data acquisition was automated using computer control of programmable current sources and voltmeters. In some cases the dynamic conductance was determined through numerical differentiation. For the Bi2212 no filtering or numerical smoothing of the data was employed at any stage of data analysis. No correlation was noticed between the apparent junction quality and spectral behavior. The junctions were measured as a function of temperature in a standard helium cryostat equipped with a temperature-controlled sample holder.

## III Tunneling and Andreev Spectroscopy

Tunneling spectroscopy provides a sensitive probe of the quasiparticle density of states _N_(_E_) and thus renders possible a direct measurement of the superconducting energy gap \Delta. [13] In a S-I-N junction the conductance _dI/dV_ at T = 0 is proportional to _N_(_E_), _dI/dV_ ~ _N_(_eV_). However, for the high-_T__c_ superconductors a wide variety of tunneling spectra have been reported, generally deviating from the usual BCS behavior (see, for example Ref. [14] and references therein). Among the anomalies is the so-called zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP) observed in many cases, especially for _a_-axis tunneling. Recent theories of tunneling spectroscopy for anisotropic superconductors take into account in a natural manner the formation of the Andreev bound states on the surface of superconductors and successfully explain the ZBCP in terms of _d_x_2-_y_2-wave superconductivity. [15, 16] As far as Bi2212 is concerned, there are now ample reasons to believe that this material has _d_-wave pairing symmetry. For example, the observation of half-flux quantum in a tricrystal ring [17] indicates that the superconducting order parameter in Bi2212 changes sign along |k_{x}| = |k_{y}| directions in (k_{x}, k_{y}) space, which is consistent with the _d_x_2-_y_2-pairing symmetry. We have used this result as a starting point for revealing the pairing symmetry of the ladder A_{5/7}.

In our tunneling measurements on monocrystalline ladder and highly textured Bi2212 samples we have always ob  served clear and rather narrow ZBCP. Taking into account the above mentioned theoretical developments, we consider that this observation confirms the existence of Andreev bound states on the junction interface due to the d_{x^{2} - ,y^{2}}-wave symmetry of the pair potential in both Bi2212 and \Lambda_{57} superconductors.

The anisotropic energy gap in a superconductor can also be deduced from the Andreev reflection measurements. As a result of Andreev reflection from the N-S interface, there is an interchange of electrons and holes, with a hole reflected in the opposite direction to the one in which the incident electron had been moving. This leads to doubling of the junction conductance \sigma(V) = dII/dV at V = 0, i.e., \sigma(0)/\sigma(eV \equiv \Delta) \approx 2.[18] Such behavior in the reflection is retained even for large electron incidence angles. As a result, if the N-S junction is elaborated on a single crystal, Andreev reflected electrons carry information about the value of \Delta(\mathbf{k}) for all directions of the wave vector \mathbf{k}. Thus, by a single measurement of the conductance of a point-contact N-S junction it is possible to completely reconstruct the anisotropy of the energy gap \Delta(\mathbf{k}) of the superconductor. The \Delta values obtained from Andreev spectroscopy will be further denoted as \Delta_{A}.

In Fig. 1 is shown the temperature dependence of _c_-axis normal resistance R_{N} and \Delta_{A}(T) for the investigated two-leg ladder \Lambda_{57}. The voltage dependence of \sigma(V) = dII/dV of a (Sr,Ca)_{10}Cu_{17}O_{29}-Ag junction is shown in Fig. 2. No surface degradation effects caused by oxygen migration [19] were observed.

Tunneling spectra of the ladder \Lambda_{57} and Bi2212 are shown in Fig. 3. The peaks in the tunneling conductance at eV \equiv \Delta_{T} are clearly visible, as well as ZBCP. The distance between maxima of the \sigma(V) curves yields twice the energy gap \Delta_{T}.

The \Delta_{A} dependence on temperature for Andreev (Sr,Ca)_{10}Cu_{17}O_{29}-Ag junctions is similar to the well-known BCS \Delta(T) curve for the energy gap of a superconductor (cf. Fig. 1 and Fig. 4). On the other hand, the tunneling gap \Delta_{T}(T) does not show any clear temperature dependence and remains temperature independent up to T_{c}, as can be seen from Fig. 3. This can be related to the pseudogap formation in Bi2212 (Ref. [20]) and in ladders.[3]

## IV Gap symmetry

To get a feeling for the nature of the experimental results, we calculated the conductivity \sigma(V) of a d-superconductor-normal-metal junction. For simplicity, we assumed that the anisotropy of the energy gap \Delta is most pronounced in the ladder (ca)-plane (corresponding to the (ab) plane in the conventional cuprates) and we used the quasi-two-dimensional isotropic band structure. Then the expression for the tunneling conductance can be written as [16]

\[\sigma(V) = G_{NS}(V)\!\sim\!G_{NN}\frac{1}{T}\bigg{\uparrow}\int\sigma_{S}(E\] (1) \[+\,i\Gamma\,,\theta)\,\,{\rm sech}^{2}\bigg{(}\frac{E-eV}{2\,k_{B} T}\bigg{)}\exp\bigg{[}-\bigg{(}\frac{\theta}{\beta}\bigg{)}^{2}\bigg{]}dEd\,\theta,\]

where G_{NN} is the junction conductance in normal state, \theta is the injection angle of the tunneling electron, \beta is the tunneling cone width, [13] and the quantity \sigma_{S} is given by

\[\sigma_{S}(E,\theta) = \frac{16(1+|\Gamma_{+}|^{2}){\rm cos}^{4}\,\,\theta+4Z^{2}(1-| \Gamma_{+}\Gamma_{-}|^{2}){\rm cos}^{2}\,\,\theta}{|4\,\,{\rm cos}^{2}\,\, \theta+Z^{2}\{1-\Gamma_{+}\Gamma_{-}\}|^{2}},\] (2a) \[\Gamma_{\pm}(E,\theta) = \frac{E-\Omega(E,\theta\pm\alpha)}{\Delta\,(\theta\pm\alpha) 

## V Discussion

During the last five years considerable progress has been made towards the resolution of the debate whether the order parameter in the high-T_{c} superconductors has nodes, or not (for a recent review see Ref. [25]). Several recent phase-sensitive tests of the order parameter symmetry have provided very convincing evidence for d-wave pairing in the high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors (see, for example, Refs. [17] and [22]). On the other hand, the consistent observation of Josephson tunneling between c-axis-oriented (twinned) Y-Ba-Cu-O and Pb has yielded strong evidence for mixed d- and s-wave pairing in Y-Ba-Cu-O.[26] There is also a theoretical possibility for the existence of mixed d\!+\!s pairing in Y-Ba-Cu-O and Bi2112 as a consequence of their orthorhombicity.[22] Therefore, it is important to demonstrate experimentally the existence of pure d-wave high-T_{c} superconductors.

Our experimental results confirm d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} order-parameter symmetry in cuprate superconductor Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8} and supply the looked for evidence of such pairing in the ladder superconductor (SrCa)_{10}Cu_{17}O_{29}. The observed zero-bias conductance peaks in tunneling conductance are present only if there is a change in sign of the pair potential in different {\bf k} directions. Thus, the experimental observations of ZBCP (i.e., Andreev bound states) give definite evidence for the change of sign of the order parameter on the Fermi surface.

All superconductive cuprates are doped correlated insulators.[27] The underdoped ladders are Mott insulators with a spin gap in contrast to the antiferromagnetic high-T_{c} cuprates.[28] However, the transport properties of the doped ladders and cuprates have a common feature. Due to the pseudogap opening the charge transport is confined in the two-dimensional CuO_{2} plane for high-T_{c} cuprates and in the Cu_{2}O_{3} plane for spin-ladder compounds.[7, 29] In a conventional CuO_{2} superconductor there are linear "rivers of charge" (stripes) threading through the antiferromagnetic background.[30] These self-organized structures are a consequence of the tendency of the correlated antiferromagnet to expel doped holes.[31] The doped ladder compound (SrCa)_{10}Cu_{17}O_{29} may have similar one-dimensional metallic and spin-gapped regions in close electrical contact built into their structure and not necessarily self-organized. The two-leg Cu_{2}O_{3} ladder (which has a spin gap[1, 4] and a pseudogap[29, 32]) in intimate contact with doped CuO_{2} chains could therefore display the mechanism of superconductivity analogous to conventional high-T_{c} cuprates.

## VI Conclusions

In summary, we have investigated the tunneling and Andreev S-N junction spectra of ladder (SrCa)_{10}Cu_{17}O_{29} and cuprate Bi2212 over a wide range of energies and temperatures. The results are consistent with d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}-wave symmetry of the order parameter \Delta in both compounds. For Bi2212 we observed characteristics which might indicate pure d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}-wave symmetry.

###### Abstract

We performed tunneling experiments on single crystals of hole-doped two-leg ladders (SrCa)10Cu17O29 with T_{c}=75 K and, for reference purposes, on textured bulk samples of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (Bi2212). Point-contact and break-junction (Bi2212 only) junction configurations were used. The point-contact junctions, both superconductor-insulator-normal-metal and superconductor-normal-metal, were using Ag counterelectrodes. In all experiments the tunneling direction was along Cu2O3 planes (for the ladders) and CuO2 planes (for Bi2212). The recorded tunneling conductance spectra were reproducible with sharp, well-defined energy-gap structures. All junctions exhibited a pronounced zero-bias conductance peak disappearing at the critical temperature. Experimental results are consistent with the formation of zero-energy Andreev bound states at the surface of the superconductors and d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}-wave symmetry of the order parameter D in both compounds.

## I Introduction

After the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity much interest was invested in low-dimensional quantum spin systems, including the so-called spin-ladder systems [1] of ((M_{1-x}M_{x}^{\prime})2Cu2O3)_{m}(CuO2)_{n} type (designated further on as \Lambda_{m/n}), where M stands for alkaline earth metal and M^{\prime} for trivalent metal. These materials consist of alternate planes containing Cu2O3 two-leg ladders and single CuO2 chains separated by M-M^{\prime} layers. It has been shown theoretically that a two-leg spin ladder suitably doped may become superconducting with a d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}-wave symmetry. [1, 2, 3] Superconductivity was observed experimentally in some ladder compounds. The transition to superconducting state was observed at ambient pressure in single crystals of the (M_{2}Cu2O3)5(CuO2) \sigmaA57 compound, [4, 5] while the samples of SrCa14-xCa2O41.84 (x = 0.4 and x = 2.5) were superconducting at 3 - 4.5 GPa at 9 - 12 K. [6, 7] No attempt was made in these experiments to determine the symmetry of the order parameter.

In this paper we report on the results of tunneling and Andreev reflection spectroscopy of the energy gap in the bismuth-doped single crystals of composition (Ca5.84Sr4.02Bi0.14)Cu15.84O29, a superconductor with T_{c}\,\! for 16 h, compressed again, and finally annealed at T = 830 degC for 14 h in order to obtain a well pronounced texture.

Superconductor-normal-metal (S-N) (Andreev) and superconductor-insulator-normal-metal (S-I-N) (tunnel) junctions with silver N counterelectrodes were fabricated by two methods. The first, used for Bi samples, was based on pressing a fine silver powder into the ceramic material. The powder composed of particles with d = 3 \mum diameter was spread over the surface of the ceramic sample and fixed with a drop of silicon varnish. The sample was then subjected to hydrostatic pressure of up to 15 kbar. From Sharvin's formula [11] for the point-contact resistance R_{N} = 4_ \rho_l_/3 \pi_a_2, where we assume Ag resistivity r  1 \mu\Omega cm and the mean free path l ~ 0.1 \mum, we estimate the resultant point-contact radius to be a  1000 A.

The second method was used for the ladder samples and relied on baking the silver powder smeared on the sample surface. First the low-resistance voltage and current contact pads were prepared by baking the silver powder at 500 - 600 degC for 2 h in air. Then the powder was spread over a small spot at the intended junction location and baked at 400 - 450 degC for 40 - 60 min in air. Leads were attached to the junction spot by a splash of indium solder. The outer diameter of such a junction was 1 - 1.5 mm, while the area of the spectroscopic S-N microjunction estimated from Sharvin's formula is much smaller, about 10 \mum^{2}. Only a single S-N contact resulted from both described methods.

Superconductor-insulator-superconductor (S-I-S) junctions were prepared as "break-junctions," a form which is particularly appropriate for the study of high-temperature superconductors. [12] Superconducting gap features and their temperature dependence can be obtained in this configuration with high stability and reproducibility, and the peaks in tunneling conductance allow direct measurement of 2 \Delta. To prepare such junctions, the Bi2212 sample bars were glued with silicon varnish to a flexible steel plate. The external surface of the sample except for the contact pads was also covered by a 0.5-mm-thick layer of this varnish. After polymerizing, the sample-plate assembly became a solid unit. To form a break junction, the steel substrate was bent until the wafer was broken (without breaking the varnish coat). Then the external force was released and the substrate returned to the initial position.

The microjunctions formed this way inside the sample, were--as witnessed by their _I-V_ characteristics--either of the tunneling type with R_{N} ~ 50 - 100 \Omega, or of the S-C-S type, where C stands for constriction, with Andreev conductivity (R_{N} ~ 1 - 5 \Omega). As a rule these junctions exhibited a crisp singularity at _eV_ = \Delta, typical of well defined single junctions. Rarely faulty (multiple) junctions were obtained with smeared singularity indicating a variation of break angle with respect to crystal planes, but such samples were eliminated from further investigations. The investigated junctions were highly stable and their conductance could be repeatedly measured in the temperature range from 4.2 to 350 K. The varnish coating plays in the described fabrication method a very important role by protecting the ceramic compound from degradation and preventing mechanical instabilities. Because thin (_D_  0.1 mm) highly textured ceramic bars are employed, the junction is formed from a single microcrystal (_d_ ~ 10 \mum) and its geometry is favorable for probing in-plane tunneling characteristics.

According to Ref. [10], the atomic force and scanning electron microscopy of cleaved surfaces of Bi2212 crystals reveal broad flat regions separated by large cleavage steps. The surface roughness of the flat regions was found to be approximately 15 A (corresponding to the distance between BiO layers). The large cleavage steps were several mm apart and typically 1 -10 \mum high. We assume that in our case the situation was similar and the tunneling was realized predominantly in the direction of base CuO_{2} planes, with the barrier roughly perpendicular to these planes. This assertion is confirmed by the comparison of the obtained experimental _dI/dV_ versus V curves with the theory of tunneling spectroscopy of _d_-wave superconductors (see below). We found that the angle \alpha between the normal vector to the junction interface and the CuO_{2} plane of the microcrystal was small, \alpha \leq 10deg. The cross section of a typical microjunction was about 0.1 \times 0.1 \mum^{2}.

The differential conductance _dI/dV_ as a function of voltage V was recorded using standard lock-in techniques [13] with a small ac modulation of 10 mV superimposed on a slowly varying bias voltage applied to the sample. Data acquisition was automated using computer control of programmable current sources and voltmeters. In some cases the dynamic conductance was determined through numerical differentiation. For the Bi2212 no filtering or numerical smoothing of the data was employed at any stage of data analysis. No correlation was noticed between the apparent junction quality and spectral behavior. The junctions were measured as a function of temperature in a standard helium cryostat equipped with a temperature-controlled sample holder.

## III Tunneling and Andreev Spectroscopy

Tunneling spectroscopy provides a sensitive probe of the quasiparticle density of states _N_(_E_) and thus renders possible a direct measurement of the superconducting energy gap \Delta. [13] In a S-I-N junction the conductance _dI/dV_ at T = 0 is proportional to _N_(_E_), _dI/dV_ ~ _N_(_eV_). However, for the high-_T__c_ superconductors a wide variety of tunneling spectra have been reported, generally deviating from the usual BCS behavior (see, for example Ref. [14] and references therein). Among the anomalies is the so-called zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP) observed in many cases, especially for _a_-axis tunneling. Recent theories of tunneling spectroscopy for anisotropic superconductors take into account in a natural manner the formation of the Andreev bound states on the surface of superconductors and successfully explain the ZBCP in terms of _d_x_2-_y_2-wave superconductivity. [15, 16] As far as Bi2212 is concerned, there are now ample reasons to believe that this material has _d_-wave pairing symmetry. For example, the observation of half-flux quantum in a tricrystal ring [17] indicates that the superconducting order parameter in Bi2212 changes sign along |k_{x}| = |k_{y}| directions in (k_{x}, k_{y}) space, which is consistent with the _d_x_2-_y_2-pairing symmetry. We have used this result as a starting point for revealing the pairing symmetry of the ladder A_{5/7}.

In our tunneling measurements on monocrystalline ladder and highly textured Bi2212 samples we have always ob  served clear and rather narrow ZBCP. Taking into account the above mentioned theoretical developments, we consider that this observation confirms the existence of Andreev bound states on the junction interface due to the d_{x^{2} - ,y^{2}}-wave symmetry of the pair potential in both Bi2212 and \Lambda_{57} superconductors.

The anisotropic energy gap in a superconductor can also be deduced from the Andreev reflection measurements. As a result of Andreev reflection from the N-S interface, there is an interchange of electrons and holes, with a hole reflected in the opposite direction to the one in which the incident electron had been moving. This leads to doubling of the junction conductance \sigma(V) = dII/dV at V = 0, i.e., \sigma(0)/\sigma(eV \equiv \Delta) \approx 2.[18] Such behavior in the reflection is retained even for large electron incidence angles. As a result, if the N-S junction is elaborated on a single crystal, Andreev reflected electrons carry information about the value of \Delta(\mathbf{k}) for all directions of the wave vector \mathbf{k}. Thus, by a single measurement of the conductance of a point-contact N-S junction it is possible to completely reconstruct the anisotropy of the energy gap \Delta(\mathbf{k}) of the superconductor. The \Delta values obtained from Andreev spectroscopy will be further denoted as \Delta_{A}.

In Fig. 1 is shown the temperature dependence of _c_-axis normal resistance R_{N} and \Delta_{A}(T) for the investigated two-leg ladder \Lambda_{57}. The voltage dependence of \sigma(V) = dII/dV of a (Sr,Ca)_{10}Cu_{17}O_{29}-Ag junction is shown in Fig. 2. No surface degradation effects caused by oxygen migration [19] were observed.

Tunneling spectra of the ladder \Lambda_{57} and Bi2212 are shown in Fig. 3. The peaks in the tunneling conductance at eV \equiv \Delta_{T} are clearly visible, as well as ZBCP. The distance between maxima of the \sigma(V) curves yields twice the energy gap \Delta_{T}.

The \Delta_{A} dependence on temperature for Andreev (Sr,Ca)_{10}Cu_{17}O_{29}-Ag junctions is similar to the well-known BCS \Delta(T) curve for the energy gap of a superconductor (cf. Fig. 1 and Fig. 4). On the other hand, the tunneling gap \Delta_{T}(T) does not show any clear temperature dependence and remains temperature independent up to T_{c}, as can be seen from Fig. 3. This can be related to the pseudogap formation in Bi2212 (Ref. [20]) and in ladders.[3]

## IV Gap symmetry

To get a feeling for the nature of the experimental results, we calculated the conductivity \sigma(V) of a d-superconductor-normal-metal junction. For simplicity, we assumed that the anisotropy of the energy gap \Delta is most pronounced in the ladder (ca)-plane (corresponding to the (ab) plane in the conventional cuprates) and we used the quasi-two-dimensional isotropic band structure. Then the expression for the tunneling conductance can be written as [16]

\[\sigma(V) = G_{NS}(V)\!\sim\!G_{NN}\frac{1}{T}\bigg{\uparrow}\int\sigma_{S}(E\] (1) \[+\,i\Gamma\,,\theta)\,\,{\rm sech}^{2}\bigg{(}\frac{E-eV}{2\,k_{B} T}\bigg{)}\exp\bigg{[}-\bigg{(}\frac{\theta}{\beta}\bigg{)}^{2}\bigg{]}dEd\,\theta,\]

where G_{NN} is the junction conductance in normal state, \theta is the injection angle of the tunneling electron, \beta is the tunneling cone width, [13] and the quantity \sigma_{S} is given by

\[\sigma_{S}(E,\theta) = \frac{16(1+|\Gamma_{+}|^{2}){\rm cos}^{4}\,\,\theta+4Z^{2}(1-| \Gamma_{+}\Gamma_{-}|^{2}){\rm cos}^{2}\,\,\theta}{|4\,\,{\rm cos}^{2}\,\, \theta+Z^{2}\{1-\Gamma_{+}\Gamma_{-}\}|^{2}},\] (2a) \[\Gamma_{\pm}(E,\theta) = \frac{E-\Omega(E,\theta\pm\alpha)}{\Delta\,(\theta\pm\alpha) 

## V Discussion

During the last five years considerable progress has been made towards the resolution of the debate whether the order parameter in the high-T_{c} superconductors has nodes, or not (for a recent review see Ref. [25]). Several recent phase-sensitive tests of the order parameter symmetry have provided very convincing evidence for d-wave pairing in the high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors (see, for example, Refs. [17] and [22]). On the other hand, the consistent observation of Josephson tunneling between c-axis-oriented (twinned) Y-Ba-Cu-O and Pb has yielded strong evidence for mixed d- and s-wave pairing in Y-Ba-Cu-O.[26] There is also a theoretical possibility for the existence of mixed d\!+\!s pairing in Y-Ba-Cu-O and Bi2112 as a consequence of their orthorhombicity.[22] Therefore, it is important to demonstrate experimentally the existence of pure d-wave high-T_{c} superconductors.

Our experimental results confirm d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} order-parameter symmetry in cuprate superconductor Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8} and supply the looked for evidence of such pairing in the ladder superconductor (SrCa)_{10}Cu_{17}O_{29}. The observed zero-bias conductance peaks in tunneling conductance are present only if there is a change in sign of the pair potential in different {\bf k} directions. Thus, the experimental observations of ZBCP (i.e., Andreev bound states) give definite evidence for the change of sign of the order parameter on the Fermi surface.

All superconductive cuprates are doped correlated insulators.[27] The underdoped ladders are Mott insulators with a spin gap in contrast to the antiferromagnetic high-T_{c} cuprates.[28] However, the transport properties of the doped ladders and cuprates have a common feature. Due to the pseudogap opening the charge transport is confined in the two-dimensional CuO_{2} plane for high-T_{c} cuprates and in the Cu_{2}O_{3} plane for spin-ladder compounds.[7, 29] In a conventional CuO_{2} superconductor there are linear "rivers of charge" (stripes) threading through the antiferromagnetic background.[30] These self-organized structures are a consequence of the tendency of the correlated antiferromagnet to expel doped holes.[31] The doped ladder compound (SrCa)_{10}Cu_{17}O_{29} may have similar one-dimensional metallic and spin-gapped regions in close electrical contact built into their structure and not necessarily self-organized. The two-leg Cu_{2}O_{3} ladder (which has a spin gap[1, 4] and a pseudogap[29, 32]) in intimate contact with doped CuO_{2} chains could therefore display the mechanism of superconductivity analogous to conventional high-T_{c} cuprates.

## VI Conclusions

In summary, we have investigated the tunneling and Andreev S-N junction spectra of ladder (SrCa)_{10}Cu_{17}O_{29} and cuprate Bi2212 over a wide range of energies and temperatures. The results are consistent with d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}-wave symmetry of the order parameter \Delta in both compounds. For Bi2212 we observed characteristics which might indicate pure d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}-wave symmetry.
