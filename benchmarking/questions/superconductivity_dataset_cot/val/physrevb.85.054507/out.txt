###### Abstract

We report the results of electrical and magnetic properties on a series of K_{x}Fe_{2-y}S_{2} (x = 1, 0.8, y = 0.1-0.5) single crystals. KFe_{1.5}S_{2} exhibits a semiconductor electrical property and undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at about 43 K. Superconductivity was not found by only varying iron concentrations. However, codoping with iron and selenium in KFe_{1.5}S_{2} can successfully induce superconductivity at 26 K. The experimental data provide evidence that the chemical pressure and disorder scattering may be responsible for the emergence of superconductivity.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in anti-PbO-type FeSe [1] has aroused a lot of interest in researching new iron-chalcogenides superconductors due to its simple structure and tunable superconductivity. The partial substitutions of sulfur and tellurium for Se enhance the superconducting transition temperature up to 15.5 and 15.2 K, respectively. [2, 3] Furthermore, the superconductivity transition temperature of FeSe also could be enhanced up to 37 K by the exertion of high pressures. [4, 5] More recently, our work about K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} demonstrated that K cations intercalation could strikingly enhance the T_{\rm c} up to \sim30 K under ambient pressure. [6] After that, it was soon confirmed that other monovalent ions, such as Cs, Rb, Tl, were also successfully intercalated into the FeSe layers and induced superconductivity. [7, 8, 9, 10] Powder x-ray diffraction experiments showed that A_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} (A = K, Cs, Rb, Tl) compounds adopt the average ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure as well as exhibit a large amount of vacancies in the A and Fe sites. These compounds share some peculiar features, such as high T_{\rm c}, ordered Fe vacancies, and complex superstructures. [11] More surprisingly, the recent Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) [12, 13] and theoretical calculation [14, 15, 16] indicate AFe_{1.7}Se_{2} only has four electron-like Fermi surfaces, implying the interpocket scattering (S^{\pm} pair symmetry) is absent, and the underlying paring mechanism may be different from other iron-based superconductors. In addition, it is proposed [17, 18] that long-range Fe or Fe-vacancy ordering results in an antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductor ground state, which echoes the behavior of superconductivity in cuprates. [19] Therefore, it is urgent to compare the magnetic and transport properties of A_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} with another similar compound and then attempt to unveil the interplay between superconductivity and magnetic or iron ordering.

In this report, a series of K_{x}Fe_{2-y}S_{2} single crystals, analogous compounds of A_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2}, have been synthesized by the flux method. The effects of Fe deficiency on crystal structure and electrical and magnetic properties have been systematically investigated. The parent KFe_{1.5}S_{2} exhibits an AFM semiconductor ground state, and the superconductivity cannot be induced by only varying the Fe content. However, the codoping of Fe and Se in KFe_{1.5}S_{2} can successfully push an AFM semiconductor state into a superconducting state at \sim26.3 K.

## II Experimental

The series of single crystals were synthesized using a similar method described in Ref. [6]. First, Fe_{2-y}S_{2} and FeSSe powders were prepared with iron (Alfa, 99.9+%), sublimed sulfur (98%), and selenium (Alfa, 99.99%) powders by a high-temperature sintering method. Then, the synthesized powder and K (Sinopharm Chemical, 97%) mixed with predetermined stoichiometry were treated by the similar method described in Ref. [6]. Well-formed single crystals with shiny surfaces having dimensions up to 6 x 6 x 0.5 mm could be obtained. The as-prepared samples were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) using a panalytical X'pert diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation. Rietveld refinements of the data were performed with the FULLPROF package. [20] The dc magnetic properties were characterized using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM, Quantum Design). The electrical resistivity was measured through the standard four-wire method on the Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design) with magnetic field up to 9 T. The electrodes were made using silver paste with the contacting resistance below 0.06 \Omega at room temperature. It should be noted that all physical properties were measured using the obtained single crystals.

## III Results and Discussion

First, we select the representative K_{0.8}Fe_{1.7}S_{2} to analyze the crystal structure of K_{x}Fe_{2-y}S_{2} samples. We measured the atomic ratio of as-prepared single crystals by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) from the nominal KFe_{2}S_{2} boule, and the actual composition is K_{0.8}Fe_{1.7}S_{2}. Figure 1 shows the x-ray diffraction pattern of KFe_{2}S_{2} powder at room temperature. Except for a little iron impurity, most of the XRD reflections can be indexed with a tetragonal unit cell. The experimental results are very similar to those of K_{0.8}Fe_{2}Se_{2}, where the intercalated K ions expel iron out of lattice so as to keep the charge balance. Like K_{0.8}Fe_{1.7}Se_{2}, it is difficult to observe satellite peaks derived from K/iron vacancies under the equipment resolution. The systemic extinction indicates an average body-centered lattice, and the probable space group is _14_/_mmm_, which is similar to A_{0.8}Fe_{1.7}Se_{2}. We adopted the structural model of K_{0.8}Fe_{1.7}Se_{2} to carry out the Rietveld refinement. The results of Rietveld refinement of K_{0.8}Fe_{1.7}S_{2} powder as well as  importantly structural parameters are listed in Table 1. The agreement factors were _Rp_ = 2.03%, _Rwp_ = 2.81%, and _kh_2 = 2.08, respectively. The refined lattice parameters [_a_ = b = 3.7451(2) A, c = 13.5782(5) A, and V = 190.443(5) A3] are reasonably smaller than those of K0.8Fe1.7Se2, a consequence of the smaller size of S2- compared to Se2-. From the crystallographic point of view, the average crystal structure consists of antifluorite-type S-Fe_{\text{e}}-S layers forming edge-sharing Fe_{\text{a}}S_{4} tetrahedra separated by single K-cation sheets. Regarding superstructure, extensive literatures reported that there are not only complex superstructure in iron-chalcogenide ternary compounds, but the content of iron also can dramatically influence the superstructure and fundamental properties.[11, 21] The detailed analyses of superstructure in titled compounds are underway.

Figure 2(a) displays the temperature dependence of _kh_ for KFe1.5S2 for H parallel to the c axis and _ab_ plane. We can see that both susceptibility curves show broad maximums at T_{N} = ~43 K, which is different from that of the work of Lei _et al._22 This characterization suggests the occurrence of an AFM correlation transition of KFe1.5S2. The susceptibility exhibits perfect paramagnetic behavior when the temperature is above ~43 K. The abnormal of zero field cooling (ZFC) curve at 175 K is probably due to the centering shift of the sample. The inset of Fig. 2(a) shows the fitting _kh_(_T_) data from 180 to 260 K using the extended Curie-Weiss-type formula,

\[\chi(T) = \chi_{0} + \frac{C}{(T - \theta )}.\]

The fitted results give the _kh_0 = 2.61 x 10-5 emu\cdotg^{- 1}\cdotOe^{- 1}, Curie constant C = 2.56 x 10-4 emu\cdotK\cdotg^{- 1}\cdotOe^{- 1}, and _th_ = -112 K for the _H_\parallel_c_ axis curve. Here, the _T_-independent term _kh_0 is defined as the sum of _kh_core and _kh_vv, which means the diamagnetism of all core ions and Van Vleck paramagnetism, respectively. Since the value of _kh_core is about 5 x 10-7 emu\cdotg^{- 1}\cdotOe^{- 1},[23] and the estimated value _kh_vv of KFe1.5Se2 is ~5.4 x 10-7 emu\cdotg^{- 1}\cdotOe^{- 1} as the empirical value per mole of transition metal atoms, hence, the summation gives the estimated value _kh_0 \times 1.4 x 10-6 emu\cdotg^{- 1}\cdotOe^{- 1}, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the calculated _kh_0. This difference might be ascribed to the simplified model without considering the interaction of intralayer Fe-Fe atoms. The obtained effective moment, _m_eff = 0.62 m_{B}, is much smaller than those of K_{x}Fe2_{\text{e}}_{\text{e}}_{\text{e}}_{\text{e}}_{\text{e}}_{\text{e}} and KFe0.85Ag1.15Te2,[25] but this value is comparable with those of iron-pnictides.[26] Figure 2(b) shows temperature dependence of the _ab_-plane electrical resistivity for KFe1.5S2. As seen in Fig. 2(b), KFe1.5S2 exhibits typical semiconductor behavior with resistivity increasing slightly and then steeply increasing as the temperature down to 75 K. As temperature decreases, the resistivity roughly obeys thermally activated behavior:

\[\rho(T) = \rho_{0}\exp\left( \frac{E_{a}}{K_{B}T} \right),\]

where r0 refers to a prefactor and K_{B} is Boltzman's constant. The fitted activation energy gap E_{a} is about 52 meV using the _r_(_T_) data from 300 to 10 K, which is slightly larger than that of (Tl,K)Fe1.5Se2.[8]

In order to explore the Fe-doped effect on KFe1.5S2, we investigated the electrical resistivity and magnetic properties of Fe-doped K0.8Fe2_{  temperature dependence of static susceptibility of K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}S_{2} single crystals with H=1 T parallel to the c axis. From Fig. 3(c), we can see that there are anomalies at about 255 and 260 K for K_{0.8}Fe_{1.6}S_{2} and K_{0.8}Fe_{1.7}S_{2}, respectively. There exists quasilinear temperature dependence of susceptibility when the temperature is above the abnormal point. It can be seen that there are also similar increments within susceptibility curves at higher temperatures for K_{0.8}Fe_{1.8}S_{2} and K_{0.8}Fe_{1.9}S_{2} samples. Iron-doping reduces the magnetic susceptibility and dramatically alters magnetic properties of higher Fe-content samples compared with KFe_{1.5}S_{2}, where the AFM ground state was well established. Actually, the linear temperature dependence of \chi(T) at moderate temperatures seems to be a universal feature in iron-pnictide superconductors [27, 28]. As discussed so far, this kind of behavior implies the existence of a local spin density wave (SDW) ordered state. Also, this strong

  coupling of SDW competes with superconductivity and even survives in superconducting samples. Following this scenario, we speculate that this kind of temperature dependence in doped samples is possibly attributed to the SDW instabilities.

Herein, we further modify the crystal structure through anion substitution and then study the electrical and magnetic properties of 50% Se-doped K0.8Fe_{1,7}SSe. Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependence of ab-plane electrical resistivity \rho(T) of K0.8Fe_{1,7}SSe. The upper inset shows the x-ray diffraction pattern of a K0.8Fe_{1,7}SSe single crystal, which implies the as-prepared samples are perfectly oriented along the c axis. The resistivity curve exhibits a nonlinear hump at higher temperatures, which is a little bit similar with those of A_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2}. High-pressure _in-situ_ measurement of K0.8Fe_{1,7}Se_{2} indicates that the hump coexists with the superconductivity, and it could be suppressed by enhancing the magnitude of Fe ordering.[29; 30] The electrical resistivity suddenly drops when the temperature is below 26.3 K. We can observe that the electrical resistivity finally vanishes at 24.6 K, and the narrow transition implies the superconducting phase is homogeneous in K0.8Fe_{1,7}SSe. The magnetization of K0.8Fe_{1,7}SSe crystal as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 4(b). No more magnetic transition occurs above the T_{c}^{\text{onset}}. The ZFC and FC susceptibilities show that the diamagnetic signal emerges at \sim24.5 K with the magnetic field at 10 Oe, which is consistent with the resistivity data. The superconducting volume fraction estimated from the ZFC magnetic field at 10 K is about 80%, and the above characterizations indicate the bulk superconductivity nature of the crystals. Figure 4(c) plots the electrical resistivity of K0.8Fe_{1,7}SSe under different magnetic fields applied parallel to the c axis. The superconducting transition temperature is suppressed gradually, and the width of transition is broadened with the increase of magnetic field. In the BCS theory, the upper critical field at T=0 K can be determined by the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula H_{c,2}(0)=0.693[-(dH_{c,2}/dT)]_{T_{c}}\cdot T_{c}.[31] Using the data of H_{c,2}(T) at 90%, 50%, and 10% resistive transition, three curves can be plotted in Fig. 4(d). Using dH_{c,2}/dT=-0.74 T\cdotK^{-1}, the roughly estimated H_{c,2} at close to zero temperature is 13.5 T, which is much smaller compared with those of A_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} superconductors.[32] This weak layered coupling should be explained by the disordered distribution in Fe_{x}Se/S layers and large lattice defection caused by Se doping.

It is known that the isoelectronic doping cannot induce excess carriers in the Fe_{x}S layers; hence, it seems that codoping of Se and Fe could strengthen chemical pressure and raise disorder scattering within the Fe_{x}S layers. As we know, the chemical pressure could apparently enhance the superconducting transition temperature of FeSe and other iron-superconductors.[33; 34] On the other hand, the random Fe-vacancy distribution looks like it stabilizes the superconductivity phase in both (Tl,K)Fe_{1,5}Se_{2} and K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} in a certain range of composition. Some results[35; 36] implied that the superconductivity favors a more disordered state than the regular order of iron. Of course, the Se anion substitution is necessary

  for emergence of superconductivity, since Se 4p electrons could mediate the superexchange interaction of Fe-Fe and determine the ground state of these 122-type superconductors. The combined function suppresses long-range AFM ordering and pushes an insulating state into a superconducting ground state. However, there still is no apparent physical picture to elucidate how doping destroys the ordered iron/vacancies, and further detailed data need to be collected.

In summary, we have synthesized a new FeS-based layer compound and studied its physical properties. The electrical and magnetic analyses clearly indicate KFe_{1.5}S_{2} is an antiferromagnetic semiconductor. We cannot obtain the superconductivity by only tuning the Fe concentration in KFe_{1.5}S_{2}. Nevertheless, the codoping of Fe and Se can successfully induce superconductivity at T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset}\sim 26.3 K. It possibly gives a few hints to better understand the correlation between superconductivity and AFM semiconductors in ternary iron-chalcogenides.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in anti-PbO-type FeSe [1] has aroused a lot of interest in researching new iron-chalcogenides superconductors due to its simple structure and tunable superconductivity. The partial substitutions of sulfur and tellurium for Se enhance the superconducting transition temperature up to 15.5 and 15.2 K, respectively. [2, 3] Furthermore, the superconductivity transition temperature of FeSe also could be enhanced up to 37 K by the exertion of high pressures. [4, 5] More recently, our work about K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} demonstrated that K cations intercalation could strikingly enhance the T_{\rm c} up to \sim30 K under ambient pressure. [6] After that, it was soon confirmed that other monovalent ions, such as Cs, Rb, Tl, were also successfully intercalated into the FeSe layers and induced superconductivity. [7, 8, 9, 10] Powder x-ray diffraction experiments showed that A_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} (A = K, Cs, Rb, Tl) compounds adopt the average ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure as well as exhibit a large amount of vacancies in the A and Fe sites. These compounds share some peculiar features, such as high T_{\rm c}, ordered Fe vacancies, and complex superstructures. [11] More surprisingly, the recent Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) [12, 13] and theoretical calculation [14, 15, 16] indicate AFe_{1.7}Se_{2} only has four electron-like Fermi surfaces, implying the interpocket scattering (S^{\pm} pair symmetry) is absent, and the underlying paring mechanism may be different from other iron-based superconductors. In addition, it is proposed [17, 18] that long-range Fe or Fe-vacancy ordering results in an antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductor ground state, which echoes the behavior of superconductivity in cuprates. [19] Therefore, it is urgent to compare the magnetic and transport properties of A_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} with another similar compound and then attempt to unveil the interplay between superconductivity and magnetic or iron ordering.

In this report, a series of K_{x}Fe_{2-y}S_{2} single crystals, analogous compounds of A_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2}, have been synthesized by the flux method. The effects of Fe deficiency on crystal structure and electrical and magnetic properties have been systematically investigated. The parent KFe_{1.5}S_{2} exhibits an AFM semiconductor ground state, and the superconductivity cannot be induced by only varying the Fe content. However, the codoping of Fe and Se in KFe_{1.5}S_{2} can successfully push an AFM semiconductor state into a superconducting state at \sim26.3 K.

## II Experimental

The series of single crystals were synthesized using a similar method described in Ref. [6]. First, Fe_{2-y}S_{2} and FeSSe powders were prepared with iron (Alfa, 99.9+%), sublimed sulfur (98%), and selenium (Alfa, 99.99%) powders by a high-temperature sintering method. Then, the synthesized powder and K (Sinopharm Chemical, 97%) mixed with predetermined stoichiometry were treated by the similar method described in Ref. [6]. Well-formed single crystals with shiny surfaces having dimensions up to 6 x 6 x 0.5 mm could be obtained. The as-prepared samples were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) using a panalytical X'pert diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation. Rietveld refinements of the data were performed with the FULLPROF package. [20] The dc magnetic properties were characterized using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM, Quantum Design). The electrical resistivity was measured through the standard four-wire method on the Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design) with magnetic field up to 9 T. The electrodes were made using silver paste with the contacting resistance below 0.06 \Omega at room temperature. It should be noted that all physical properties were measured using the obtained single crystals.

## III Results and Discussion

First, we select the representative K_{0.8}Fe_{1.7}S_{2} to analyze the crystal structure of K_{x}Fe_{2-y}S_{2} samples. We measured the atomic ratio of as-prepared single crystals by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) from the nominal KFe_{2}S_{2} boule, and the actual composition is K_{0.8}Fe_{1.7}S_{2}. Figure 1 shows the x-ray diffraction pattern of KFe_{2}S_{2} powder at room temperature. Except for a little iron impurity, most of the XRD reflections can be indexed with a tetragonal unit cell. The experimental results are very similar to those of K_{0.8}Fe_{2}Se_{2}, where the intercalated K ions expel iron out of lattice so as to keep the charge balance. Like K_{0.8}Fe_{1.7}Se_{2}, it is difficult to observe satellite peaks derived from K/iron vacancies under the equipment resolution. The systemic extinction indicates an average body-centered lattice, and the probable space group is _14_/_mmm_, which is similar to A_{0.8}Fe_{1.7}Se_{2}. We adopted the structural model of K_{0.8}Fe_{1.7}Se_{2} to carry out the Rietveld refinement. The results of Rietveld refinement of K_{0.8}Fe_{1.7}S_{2} powder as well as  importantly structural parameters are listed in Table 1. The agreement factors were _Rp_ = 2.03%, _Rwp_ = 2.81%, and _kh_2 = 2.08, respectively. The refined lattice parameters [_a_ = b = 3.7451(2) A, c = 13.5782(5) A, and V = 190.443(5) A3] are reasonably smaller than those of K0.8Fe1.7Se2, a consequence of the smaller size of S2- compared to Se2-. From the crystallographic point of view, the average crystal structure consists of antifluorite-type S-Fe_{\text{e}}-S layers forming edge-sharing Fe_{\text{a}}S_{4} tetrahedra separated by single K-cation sheets. Regarding superstructure, extensive literatures reported that there are not only complex superstructure in iron-chalcogenide ternary compounds, but the content of iron also can dramatically influence the superstructure and fundamental properties.[11, 21] The detailed analyses of superstructure in titled compounds are underway.

Figure 2(a) displays the temperature dependence of _kh_ for KFe1.5S2 for H parallel to the c axis and _ab_ plane. We can see that both susceptibility curves show broad maximums at T_{N} = ~43 K, which is different from that of the work of Lei _et al._22 This characterization suggests the occurrence of an AFM correlation transition of KFe1.5S2. The susceptibility exhibits perfect paramagnetic behavior when the temperature is above ~43 K. The abnormal of zero field cooling (ZFC) curve at 175 K is probably due to the centering shift of the sample. The inset of Fig. 2(a) shows the fitting _kh_(_T_) data from 180 to 260 K using the extended Curie-Weiss-type formula,

\[\chi(T) = \chi_{0} + \frac{C}{(T - \theta )}.\]

The fitted results give the _kh_0 = 2.61 x 10-5 emu\cdotg^{- 1}\cdotOe^{- 1}, Curie constant C = 2.56 x 10-4 emu\cdotK\cdotg^{- 1}\cdotOe^{- 1}, and _th_ = -112 K for the _H_\parallel_c_ axis curve. Here, the _T_-independent term _kh_0 is defined as the sum of _kh_core and _kh_vv, which means the diamagnetism of all core ions and Van Vleck paramagnetism, respectively. Since the value of _kh_core is about 5 x 10-7 emu\cdotg^{- 1}\cdotOe^{- 1},[23] and the estimated value _kh_vv of KFe1.5Se2 is ~5.4 x 10-7 emu\cdotg^{- 1}\cdotOe^{- 1} as the empirical value per mole of transition metal atoms, hence, the summation gives the estimated value _kh_0 \times 1.4 x 10-6 emu\cdotg^{- 1}\cdotOe^{- 1}, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the calculated _kh_0. This difference might be ascribed to the simplified model without considering the interaction of intralayer Fe-Fe atoms. The obtained effective moment, _m_eff = 0.62 m_{B}, is much smaller than those of K_{x}Fe2_{\text{e}}_{\text{e}}_{\text{e}}_{\text{e}}_{\text{e}}_{\text{e}} and KFe0.85Ag1.15Te2,[25] but this value is comparable with those of iron-pnictides.[26] Figure 2(b) shows temperature dependence of the _ab_-plane electrical resistivity for KFe1.5S2. As seen in Fig. 2(b), KFe1.5S2 exhibits typical semiconductor behavior with resistivity increasing slightly and then steeply increasing as the temperature down to 75 K. As temperature decreases, the resistivity roughly obeys thermally activated behavior:

\[\rho(T) = \rho_{0}\exp\left( \frac{E_{a}}{K_{B}T} \right),\]

where r0 refers to a prefactor and K_{B} is Boltzman's constant. The fitted activation energy gap E_{a} is about 52 meV using the _r_(_T_) data from 300 to 10 K, which is slightly larger than that of (Tl,K)Fe1.5Se2.[8]

In order to explore the Fe-doped effect on KFe1.5S2, we investigated the electrical resistivity and magnetic properties of Fe-doped K0.8Fe2_{  temperature dependence of static susceptibility of K_{0.8}Fe_{2-y}S_{2} single crystals with H=1 T parallel to the c axis. From Fig. 3(c), we can see that there are anomalies at about 255 and 260 K for K_{0.8}Fe_{1.6}S_{2} and K_{0.8}Fe_{1.7}S_{2}, respectively. There exists quasilinear temperature dependence of susceptibility when the temperature is above the abnormal point. It can be seen that there are also similar increments within susceptibility curves at higher temperatures for K_{0.8}Fe_{1.8}S_{2} and K_{0.8}Fe_{1.9}S_{2} samples. Iron-doping reduces the magnetic susceptibility and dramatically alters magnetic properties of higher Fe-content samples compared with KFe_{1.5}S_{2}, where the AFM ground state was well established. Actually, the linear temperature dependence of \chi(T) at moderate temperatures seems to be a universal feature in iron-pnictide superconductors [27, 28]. As discussed so far, this kind of behavior implies the existence of a local spin density wave (SDW) ordered state. Also, this strong

  coupling of SDW competes with superconductivity and even survives in superconducting samples. Following this scenario, we speculate that this kind of temperature dependence in doped samples is possibly attributed to the SDW instabilities.

Herein, we further modify the crystal structure through anion substitution and then study the electrical and magnetic properties of 50% Se-doped K0.8Fe_{1,7}SSe. Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependence of ab-plane electrical resistivity \rho(T) of K0.8Fe_{1,7}SSe. The upper inset shows the x-ray diffraction pattern of a K0.8Fe_{1,7}SSe single crystal, which implies the as-prepared samples are perfectly oriented along the c axis. The resistivity curve exhibits a nonlinear hump at higher temperatures, which is a little bit similar with those of A_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2}. High-pressure _in-situ_ measurement of K0.8Fe_{1,7}Se_{2} indicates that the hump coexists with the superconductivity, and it could be suppressed by enhancing the magnitude of Fe ordering.[29; 30] The electrical resistivity suddenly drops when the temperature is below 26.3 K. We can observe that the electrical resistivity finally vanishes at 24.6 K, and the narrow transition implies the superconducting phase is homogeneous in K0.8Fe_{1,7}SSe. The magnetization of K0.8Fe_{1,7}SSe crystal as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 4(b). No more magnetic transition occurs above the T_{c}^{\text{onset}}. The ZFC and FC susceptibilities show that the diamagnetic signal emerges at \sim24.5 K with the magnetic field at 10 Oe, which is consistent with the resistivity data. The superconducting volume fraction estimated from the ZFC magnetic field at 10 K is about 80%, and the above characterizations indicate the bulk superconductivity nature of the crystals. Figure 4(c) plots the electrical resistivity of K0.8Fe_{1,7}SSe under different magnetic fields applied parallel to the c axis. The superconducting transition temperature is suppressed gradually, and the width of transition is broadened with the increase of magnetic field. In the BCS theory, the upper critical field at T=0 K can be determined by the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula H_{c,2}(0)=0.693[-(dH_{c,2}/dT)]_{T_{c}}\cdot T_{c}.[31] Using the data of H_{c,2}(T) at 90%, 50%, and 10% resistive transition, three curves can be plotted in Fig. 4(d). Using dH_{c,2}/dT=-0.74 T\cdotK^{-1}, the roughly estimated H_{c,2} at close to zero temperature is 13.5 T, which is much smaller compared with those of A_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} superconductors.[32] This weak layered coupling should be explained by the disordered distribution in Fe_{x}Se/S layers and large lattice defection caused by Se doping.

It is known that the isoelectronic doping cannot induce excess carriers in the Fe_{x}S layers; hence, it seems that codoping of Se and Fe could strengthen chemical pressure and raise disorder scattering within the Fe_{x}S layers. As we know, the chemical pressure could apparently enhance the superconducting transition temperature of FeSe and other iron-superconductors.[33; 34] On the other hand, the random Fe-vacancy distribution looks like it stabilizes the superconductivity phase in both (Tl,K)Fe_{1,5}Se_{2} and K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} in a certain range of composition. Some results[35; 36] implied that the superconductivity favors a more disordered state than the regular order of iron. Of course, the Se anion substitution is necessary

  for emergence of superconductivity, since Se 4p electrons could mediate the superexchange interaction of Fe-Fe and determine the ground state of these 122-type superconductors. The combined function suppresses long-range AFM ordering and pushes an insulating state into a superconducting ground state. However, there still is no apparent physical picture to elucidate how doping destroys the ordered iron/vacancies, and further detailed data need to be collected.

In summary, we have synthesized a new FeS-based layer compound and studied its physical properties. The electrical and magnetic analyses clearly indicate KFe_{1.5}S_{2} is an antiferromagnetic semiconductor. We cannot obtain the superconductivity by only tuning the Fe concentration in KFe_{1.5}S_{2}. Nevertheless, the codoping of Fe and Se can successfully induce superconductivity at T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset}\sim 26.3 K. It possibly gives a few hints to better understand the correlation between superconductivity and AFM semiconductors in ternary iron-chalcogenides.
