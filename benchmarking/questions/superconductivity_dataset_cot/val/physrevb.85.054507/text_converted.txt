###### Abstract

We report the results of electrical and magnetic properties on a series
of K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)S₂ (x = 1, 0.8, y = 0.1-0.5) single crystals.
KFe_(1.5)S₂ exhibits a semiconductor electrical property and undergoes
an antiferromagnetic transition at about 43 K. Superconductivity was not
found by only varying iron concentrations. However, codoping with iron
and selenium in KFe_(1.5)S₂ can successfully induce superconductivity at
26 K. The experimental data provide evidence that the chemical pressure
and disorder scattering may be responsible for the emergence of
superconductivity.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in anti-PbO-type FeSe [1] has aroused
a lot of interest in researching new iron-chalcogenides superconductors
due to its simple structure and tunable superconductivity. The partial
substitutions of sulfur and tellurium for Se enhance the superconducting
transition temperature up to 15.5 and 15.2 K, respectively. [2, 3]
Furthermore, the superconductivity transition temperature of FeSe also
could be enhanced up to 37 K by the exertion of high pressures. [4, 5]
More recently, our work about K_(x)Fe₂Se₂ demonstrated that K cations
intercalation could strikingly enhance the $T_{\rm c}$ up to ∼30 K under
ambient pressure. [6] After that, it was soon confirmed that other
monovalent ions, such as Cs, Rb, Tl, were also successfully intercalated
into the FeSe layers and induced superconductivity. [7, 8, 9, 10] Powder
x-ray diffraction experiments showed that A_(x)Fe₂Se₂ (A = K, Cs, Rb,
Tl) compounds adopt the average ThCr₂Si₂-type structure as well as
exhibit a large amount of vacancies in the A and Fe sites. These
compounds share some peculiar features, such as high $T_{\rm c}$,
ordered Fe vacancies, and complex superstructures. [11] More
surprisingly, the recent Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) [12, 13] and theoretical calculation [14, 15, 16] indicate
AFe_(1.7)Se₂ only has four electron-like Fermi surfaces, implying the
interpocket scattering (S^(±) pair symmetry) is absent, and the
underlying paring mechanism may be different from other iron-based
superconductors. In addition, it is proposed [17, 18] that long-range Fe
or Fe-vacancy ordering results in an antiferromagnetic (AFM)
semiconductor ground state, which echoes the behavior of
superconductivity in cuprates. [19] Therefore, it is urgent to compare
the magnetic and transport properties of A_(x)Fe₂Se₂ with another
similar compound and then attempt to unveil the interplay between
superconductivity and magnetic or iron ordering.

In this report, a series of K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)S₂ single crystals, analogous
compounds of A_(x)Fe₂Se₂, have been synthesized by the flux method. The
effects of Fe deficiency on crystal structure and electrical and
magnetic properties have been systematically investigated. The parent
KFe_(1.5)S₂ exhibits an AFM semiconductor ground state, and the
superconductivity cannot be induced by only varying the Fe content.
However, the codoping of Fe and Se in KFe_(1.5)S₂ can successfully push
an AFM semiconductor state into a superconducting state at ∼26.3 K.

## II Experimental

The series of single crystals were synthesized using a similar method
described in Ref. [6]. First, Fe_(2 − y)S₂ and FeSSe powders were
prepared with iron (Alfa, 99.9+

## III Results and Discussion

First, we select the representative K_(0.8)Fe_(1.7)S₂ to analyze the
crystal structure of K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)S₂ samples. We measured the atomic
ratio of as-prepared single crystals by inductively coupled plasma
atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) from the nominal KFe₂S₂ boule,
and the actual composition is K_(0.8)Fe_(1.7)S₂. Figure 1 shows the
x-ray diffraction pattern of KFe₂S₂ powder at room temperature. Except
for a little iron impurity, most of the XRD reflections can be indexed
with a tetragonal unit cell. The experimental results are very similar
to those of K_(0.8)Fe₂Se₂, where the intercalated K ions expel iron out
of lattice so as to keep the charge balance. Like K_(0.8)Fe_(1.7)Se₂, it
is difficult to observe satellite peaks derived from K/iron vacancies
under the equipment resolution. The systemic extinction indicates an
average body-centered lattice, and the probable space group is
_14_/_mmm_, which is similar to A_(0.8)Fe_(1.7)Se₂. We adopted the
structural model of K_(0.8)Fe_(1.7)Se₂ to carry out the Rietveld
refinement. The results of Rietveld refinement of K_(0.8)Fe_(1.7)S₂
powder as well as importantly structural parameters are listed in
Table 1. The agreement factors were _Rp_ = 2.03

Figure 2(a) displays the temperature dependence of _kh_ for KFe1.5S2 for
H parallel to the c axis and _ab_ plane. We can see that both
susceptibility curves show broad maximums at T_(N) =  43 K, which is
different from that of the work of Lei _et al._22 This characterization
suggests the occurrence of an AFM correlation transition of KFe1.5S2.
The susceptibility exhibits perfect paramagnetic behavior when the
temperature is above  43 K. The abnormal of zero field cooling (ZFC)
curve at 175 K is probably due to the centering shift of the sample. The
inset of Fig. 2(a) shows the fitting _kh_(_T_) data from 180 to 260 K
using the extended Curie-Weiss-type formula,

$$\chi(T) = \chi_{0} + \frac{C}{(T - \theta )}.$$

The fitted results give the _kh_0 = 2.61 x 10-5 emu⋅g⁻¹⋅Oe⁻¹, Curie
constant C = 2.56 x 10-4 emu⋅K⋅g⁻¹⋅Oe⁻¹, and _th_ = -112 K for the
_H_∥_c_ axis curve. Here, the _T_-independent term _kh_0 is defined as
the sum of _kh_core and _kh_vv, which means the diamagnetism of all core
ions and Van Vleck paramagnetism, respectively. Since the value of
_kh_core is about 5 x 10-7 emu⋅g⁻¹⋅Oe⁻¹,[23] and the estimated value
_kh_vv of KFe1.5Se2 is  5.4 x 10-7 emu⋅g⁻¹⋅Oe⁻¹ as the empirical value
per mole of transition metal atoms, hence, the summation gives the
estimated value _kh_0 × 1.4 x 10-6 emu⋅g⁻¹⋅Oe⁻¹, which is an order of
magnitude smaller than the calculated _kh_0. This difference might be
ascribed to the simplified model without considering the interaction of
intralayer Fe-Fe atoms. The obtained effective moment, _m_eff = 0.62
m_(B), is much smaller than those of K_(x)Fe2_(e)_(e)_(e)_(e)_(e)_(e)
and KFe0.85Ag1.15Te2,[25] but this value is comparable with those of
iron-pnictides.[26] Figure 2(b) shows temperature dependence of the
_ab_-plane electrical resistivity for KFe1.5S2. As seen in Fig. 2(b),
KFe1.5S2 exhibits typical semiconductor behavior with resistivity
increasing slightly and then steeply increasing as the temperature down
to 75 K. As temperature decreases, the resistivity roughly obeys
thermally activated behavior:

$$\rho(T) = \rho_{0}\exp\left( \frac{E_{a}}{K_{B}T} \right),$$

where r0 refers to a prefactor and K_(B) is Boltzman’s constant. The
fitted activation energy gap E_(a) is about 52 meV using the _r_(_T_)
data from 300 to 10 K, which is slightly larger than that of
(Tl,K)Fe1.5Se2.[8]

In order to explore the Fe-doped effect on KFe1.5S2, we investigated the
electrical resistivity and magnetic properties of Fe-doped
K0.8Fe2${}_{  temperature dependence of static susceptibility of K\({}_{0.8}$Fe_(2 − y)S₂
single crystals with H = 1 T parallel to the c axis. From Fig. 3(c), we
can see that there are anomalies at about 255 and 260 K for
K_(0.8)Fe_(1.6)S₂ and K_(0.8)Fe_(1.7)S₂, respectively. There exists
quasilinear temperature dependence of susceptibility when the
temperature is above the abnormal point. It can be seen that there are
also similar increments within susceptibility curves at higher
temperatures for K_(0.8)Fe_(1.8)S₂ and K_(0.8)Fe_(1.9)S₂ samples.
Iron-doping reduces the magnetic susceptibility and dramatically alters
magnetic properties of higher Fe-content samples compared with
KFe_(1.5)S₂, where the AFM ground state was well established. Actually,
the linear temperature dependence of χ(T) at moderate temperatures seems
to be a universal feature in iron-pnictide superconductors [27, 28]. As
discussed so far, this kind of behavior implies the existence of a local
spin density wave (SDW) ordered state. Also, this strong

coupling of SDW competes with superconductivity and even survives in
superconducting samples. Following this scenario, we speculate that this
kind of temperature dependence in doped samples is possibly attributed
to the SDW instabilities.

Herein, we further modify the crystal structure through anion
substitution and then study the electrical and magnetic properties of 50

It is known that the isoelectronic doping cannot induce excess carriers
in the Fe_(x)S layers; hence, it seems that codoping of Se and Fe could
strengthen chemical pressure and raise disorder scattering within the
Fe_(x)S layers. As we know, the chemical pressure could apparently
enhance the superconducting transition temperature of FeSe and other
iron-superconductors.[33; 34] On the other hand, the random Fe-vacancy
distribution looks like it stabilizes the superconductivity phase in
both (Tl,K)Fe_(1, 5)Se₂ and K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ in a certain range of
composition. Some results[35; 36] implied that the superconductivity
favors a more disordered state than the regular order of iron. Of
course, the Se anion substitution is necessary

for emergence of superconductivity, since Se 4p electrons could mediate
the superexchange interaction of Fe-Fe and determine the ground state of
these 122-type superconductors. The combined function suppresses
long-range AFM ordering and pushes an insulating state into a
superconducting ground state. However, there still is no apparent
physical picture to elucidate how doping destroys the ordered
iron/vacancies, and further detailed data need to be collected.

In summary, we have synthesized a new FeS-based layer compound and
studied its physical properties. The electrical and magnetic analyses
clearly indicate KFe_(1.5)S₂ is an antiferromagnetic semiconductor. We
cannot obtain the superconductivity by only tuning the Fe concentration
in KFe_(1.5)S₂. Nevertheless, the codoping of Fe and Se can successfully
induce superconductivity at $T_{\rm c}$${}^{\rm onset}\sim$ 26.3 K. It
possibly gives a few hints to better understand the correlation between
superconductivity and AFM semiconductors in ternary iron-chalcogenides.
