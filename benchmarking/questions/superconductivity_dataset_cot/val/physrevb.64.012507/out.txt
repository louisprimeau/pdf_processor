###### Abstract

The hydrostatic pressure effect on the newly discovered superconductor MgB_{2} has been determined. The transition temperature T_{c} was found to decrease linearly at a large rate of -1.6 K/GPa, in good quantitative agreement with the ensuing calculated value of -1.4 K/GPa within the BCS framework by Loa and Syassen, using the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method. The relative pressure coefficient d ln T_{c}/dp for MgB_{2} also falls between the known values for conventional sp and d superconductors. The observation, therefore, suggests that electron-phonon interactions play a significant role in the superconductivity of the compound.

The recent discovery[1] of superconductivity in MgB_{2} at temperatures as high as 40 K has generated great interest. MgB_{2}, which exhibits an AlB_{2} structure with honeycomb layers of boron atoms, appears to be electrically three dimensional[2] and its grain boundaries have a far less detrimental effect on superconducting current transport.[3] The new compound may provide a new way to a higher superconducting transition temperature T_{c} and an easier avenue for devices. Two models[2, 4] were subsequently advanced to account for the observation. While both have attributed the superconductivity observed mainly to the conduction bands derived from the boron sublattice, they propose different mechanisms responsible for the superconducting pairing. Based on band calculations, Kortus _et al.[2]_ suggest that it results from the strong electron-phonon interaction and the high phonon frequency associated with the light boron element. A relatively large boron isotope effect on T_{c} has recently been observed,[7] consistent with the suggestion. However, Hirsch[4] offers an alternate explanation in terms of his "universal" mechanism, conjecturing that superconductivity in MgB_{2}, similar to that in cuprate superconductors, is driven by the pairing of the heavily dressed holes in bands that are almost full to gain enough kinetic energy to overcome the Coulomb repulsion. A positive pressure effect on T_{c} has also been predicted by Hirsch if the pressure can reduce the B-B intra-plane distance. We have therefore decided to determine the hydrostatic pressure effect on T_{c}. The T_{c} was found to decrease linearly and reversibly with pressures at a relatively large rate of dT_{c}/dp\sim-1.6 K/GPa up to 1.84 GPa. The observation is in good quantitative agreement with the ensuing calculated result of -1.4 K/GPa by Loa and Syassen,[5] using the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method. The observed value of d ln T_{c}/dp also falls within those of conventional sp and d superconductors. The results therefore suggest that electron-phonon interactions play a major role in the superconductivity of this compound.

The polycrystalline MgB_{2} samples examined in the present study were prepared by the solid-state reaction method.[7] Small Mg chips (99.8% pure) and B powder (99.7%) with a stoichiometry of Mg:B = 1:2 were sealed inside a Ta tube in an Ar atmosphere. The sealed Ta ampoule was in turn enclosed in a quartz tube. The ingredients were heated slowly up to 950 degC and kept at this temperature for 2 h, followed by furnace cooling to room temperature. The samples so prepared were granular and porous and were used for measurements without further treatment. The structure was determined by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD), using a Rigaku DMAX-IIB diffractometer. The resistivity was determined by the standard four-lead technique and the ac magnetic susceptibility by an inductance method with a Linear Research Model LR-700 Bridge. The dc magnetization was measured using a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. The thermoelectric power was determined employing a home made apparatus using a sensitive ac measurement technique. The hydrostatic pressure environment was generated inside a Teflon cell filled with 3M Fluorinert FC 77 acting as the fluid pressure medium and housed in a Be-Cu high-pressure clamp.[8] The pressure was estimated using a Pb manometer situated next to the sample. The temperature was measured by a Chromel-Alumel thermocouple located next to the sample above \sim45 K and by a germanium thermometer housed at the bottom of the high-pressure clamp below \sim45 K.

The powder XRD pattern of the samples displayed the hexagonal MgB_{2} phase but with a very weak trace of MgO. The deduced lattice parameters are =3.084 A and c =3.523 A in excellent agreement with the powder diffraction database.[9]

The Seebeck coefficient (_S_) of MgB_{2} is positive and relatively small and decreases with decreasing temperature, as shown in Fig. 1, similar to a metal with effective hole-type carriers. It also exhibits a rapid drop at 38.9 K and vanishes at 38.1 K, signaling the appearance of a narrow superconducting transition and consistent with the electrical and magnetic results to be described below. The temperature dependence of the resistivity (_r_) is shown in the inset to Fig. 1. It decreases like a metal on cooling, with a resistivity ratio _r_(300 K)/_r_(40 K)\sim3, much smaller than the \sim20 reported.[5] We attributed the resistivity-ratio difference to the porosity and the grain boundary effect of our samples. The r starts to drop rapidly at \sim39 K with a rather narrow transition of 0.35 K, defined as the difference between the temperatures at 10% and 90% drops of _r_(40 K). Shown in another inset to the same figure is the dc magnetic susceptibility (\chi_{dc}) of the sample, measured at 50 Oe as a function of temperature, in both the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and the field-cooled (FC) modes. The ZFC \chi_{dc} shows a sharp superconducting transition starting at \sim 38.5 K with a width of \sim 1 K and with more than 100% superconducting shielding at 5 K prior to correction of the demagnetization factor. Similar to ZFC \chi_{dc}, FC \chi_{dc} demonstrates unambiguously a diamagnetic shift at \sim 38.5 K, but the magnitude of the signal is only \sim 1 % of that for the ZFC \chi_{dc}. This is ascribed to the granular nature of the sample and the possible strong pinning of the compound.

To determine the pressure effect on T_{c}, we chose to measure the ac magnetic susceptibility (\chi_{ac}) of the sample in a peak-to-peak field of \sim 2 Oe. At ambient pressure, similar to \chi_{dc}, \chi_{ac} undergoes a drastic diamagnetic shift with an onset temperature at \sim 38.5 K, characteristic of a superconducting transition with a midpoint temperature of \sim 37.4 K, as shown in Fig. 2. Under pressure, the superconducting transition is shifted toward a lower temperature. The pressure effect on T_{c} is summarized in Fig. 3. It is evident that T_{c} is suppressed reversibly and linearly at a rate of T_{c}/dP = - 1.6 K/GPa up to 1.84 GPa. The numbers in the figure represent the sequential order of the experimental runs.

According to BCS theory, T_{c} \propto \omegaexp\{-1.02(1 + \lambda)/[\lambda(1 - \mu*) - \mu*]\}, where \omega is the characteristic phonon frequency, \mu* the Coulomb repulsion, and \lambda the electron-phonon interaction parameter,[10] which is equal to N(0)\times(I^{2})/M(\omega^{2}) with N(0) being the density of states at the Fermi energy, \langle I^{2}\rangle the averaged square of the electronic matrix element, M the atomic mass, and \langle\omega^{2}\rangle the averaged square of the phonon frequency. The relative pressure effect on T_{c} is d\ln T_{c}/dP = d\ln\omega/dP + 1.02/[\lambda(1 - \mu*) - \mu*]^{2}(d\lambda/dP). Recent band calculations by Kortus _et al.[2]_ showed that MgB_{2} is electronically isotropic, the N(0) derived mainly from the B atoms near the Fermi surface is large, and the phonon frequency is high due to the low mass of B, resulting in a large \lambda. Pressure is expected to increase \omega, broaden the density of states, and it may reduce N(0), resulting in a relatively strong decrease in T_{c}. Following the high-pressure experiment, Loa and Syassen[3] as well as Vogt _et al.[6]_ carried out the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave calculation. Loa and Syassen found that MgB_{2} is isotropic both electronically and mechanically and found that pressure suppresses N(0) with d\ln N(0)/dP = -0.31%/GPa and enhances \omega with d\ln\omega dP = + 0.71%/GPa. By assuming \mu* and I to be pressure independent and by adopting the usual numerical values \mu* = 0.1 and the zero-pressure \lambda = 0.7, they obtained within the BCS framework d\ln T_{c}/dP\sim-3.6%/GPa or dT_{c}/dP\sim- 1.4 K/GPa for T_{c} = 39 K. The calculated value may be considered as a crude estimate; however, it is in good quantitative agreement with our measured dT_{c}/dP = - 1.6 K/GPa. Vogt _et al._ calculated a similar pressure coefficient d\ln N(0)/dP = -0.4%/GPa and argued that the pressure effect on T_{c} can be explained within the BCS theory and their band structure calculations, assuming reasonable parameters for \mu* (0.1) and \lambda (1.0). It is interesting that in both calculations the pressure-induced change of N(0) is relatively small compared with the esti

  mated increase of \omega, indicating that the main source of the decrease of T_{c} with pressure is its effect on \omega.

It has also been demonstrated [11] that, within the framework of BCS theory, the volume effect on T_{c} can be expressed as ln(T_{c}/\omega)/dV=\philn(\omega/T_{c}), where \omega is the phonon frequency, V the volume, and \phi a material-dependent parameter. For sp superconductors, \phi\sim 2.5, while for the d superconductors, \phi< 2.5 and can become negative. The lack of knowledge on \phi and on the compressibility of MgB_{2} prevents us from making a direct comparison between our observation and the predicted \phi. However, by examining all available data on the relative pressure effect on the T_{c} of conventional low-temperature noncuprate superconductors, [11, 12, 13] we found that, in general, d ln T_{c}/dP<-8 \times10^{-2} GPa for sp superconductors, but > - 2\times10^{-2}/GPa for the d superconductors, and the value is not sensitive to impurities except for cases where the Fermi surface topology changes due to the applied pressure or impurity content. For MgB_{2}, d ln T_{c}/dP\sim-4.2\times10^{-2}/GPa, which lies between the values for the two groups of conventional superconductors. It is interesting to note that d ln T_{c}/dP\sim-5 \times10^{-1}/GPa for K_{3}C_{60}, [14] in which electron-phonon interaction is considered to play an important role.

In an alternate approach, regarding the cuprate high-temperature superconductors, Hirsch [4] proposed that MgB_{2} is a hole-doped superconductor with a conduction band almost completely filled. The T_{c} varies with carrier concentration nonmonotonically and peaks at an optimal doping level. Pressure is expected to enhance the T_{c} resulting from the reduction of the B-B intraplane distance. Unfortunately, we found that the T_{c} of MgB_{2} is greatly suppressed by pressure even though MgB_{2} is mechanically isotropic [5] and the B-B intraplane distance is expected to decrease under pressure. It should be noted that a negative pressure coefficient is possible only if the pressure can induce a large change in the carrier concentration and MgB_{2} is overdoped. The positive S observed by us appears to be consistent with the hole-doped scenario of MgB_{2} suggested, although Hall data and the doping state are still unavailable.

In conclusion, the T_{c} of MgB_{2} has been found to decrease linearly and reversibly up to 1.84 GPa at a large rate of - 1.6 K/GPa, in good quantitative agreement with the values based on band calculations by Kortus _et al._ and Loa and Syassen within the BCS framework. The large relative pressure effect on T_{c} of MgB_{2} also falls within those of the conventional sp and d superconductors. The observation favors the proposition that electron-phonon interactions play a significant role in the superconductivity of this compound. Unless the pressure can induce a large hole transfer in a possibly overdoped MgB_{2} to compensate for the predicted positive pressure effect on T_{c} , the "universal" mechanism cannot account for the observation.
