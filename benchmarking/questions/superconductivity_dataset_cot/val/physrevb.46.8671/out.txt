###### Abstract

The resistive upper critical field _H_c2 as a function of temperature T has been determined for polycrystalline specimens of the isostructural antiferromagnetic heavy-fermion superconductors UT2Al3 (_T_ = Ni, Pd). The zero-temperature superconducting coherence lengths g0 = 190 A (77 A) for T = Ni (Pd) have been estimated from the initial slope of _H_c2(_T_), and analyses of previously reported specific-heat data yield an effective mass enhancement m * / m ~ 40 (49) for T = Ni (Pd), where m is the free-electron mass. High-precision measurements of the normal-state electrical resistivity reveal a broad anomaly below 4.6 K in UNi2Al3, which correlates with the onset of U-moment antiferromagnetic ordering. In UPd2Al3, the large electrical resistivity drop between _Tc_ and T _N_ = 15 K can be accurately described by an expression that is appropriate for an antiferromagnet with an energy gap D ~ 40 K and an additional T2 term reflecting Fermi-liquid behavior.

Perhaps the most significant recent developments in heavy-fermion (HF) superconductors have been the discovery of antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering with very small U moments (0.01_m_b_-0.1_m_b_) in compounds previously thought to be nonmagnetic and the delineation of complex and multicomponent superconducting phase diagrams.1 In all cases, except perhaps UBe13, superconductivity coexists with AFM ordering at low temperatures, and it is believed that the interaction between the superconducting and magnetic order parameters can lead to additional symmetry breakdown and further transitions inside the superconducting state in unconventional superconductors.

Heavy-fermion superconductivity has recently been reported in two new U-based compounds: UNi2Al3 (Ref. 2) and UPd2Al3 (Ref. 3), which exhibit AFM transitions at T = 4.6 K and T = 14 K followed by transitions to superconducting states at _T_c = 1 K and _Tc ~ 2 K, respectively. According to neutron-scattering experiments,4 the ordered magnetic moment in UPd2Al3 lies in the basal plane and is about (0.85+-0.03)_m_b_/U atom, whereas no long-range magnetic order could be detected above 1.5 K in UNi2Al3. However, zero-field muon spin-relaxation experiments revealed a commensurate AF structure in the latter compound5 in which the U moments, assumed to be along the c axis, are of the order of 0.1_m_b_/U atom and a much smaller ordered moment ~ 0.01-0.1_m_b_/U atom in UPd2Al3.6 The normal-state electrical resistivity _r_(_T_) of UNi2Al3 is reminiscent of that of UPt3 in that r increases monotonically with increasing temperature and has substantial negative curvature.7 On the other hand, the _r_(_T_) curve of UPd2Al3 resembles that of URu2Si2 with r first increasing with increasing temperature, passing through a maximum around 80 K, and decreasing with further increase in T.8 While specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements were reported to exhibit anomalies at _T_N in both compounds, the _r_(_T_) data showed a kink only in UPd2Al3, and no feature was observed in UNi2Al3-2.3 In this paper, we report resistive measurements of the upper critical field _H_c2 as a function of temperature and high-precision measurements of the low-temperature normal-state resistivity with particular attention on the antiferromagnetic transitions in UT2Al3 (_T_ = Ni and Pd) compounds.

The polycrystalline specimens of UT2Al3 (_T_ = Ni,Pd) were prepared by arc melting in an argon atmosphere and were then vacuum annealed for either 8 days at 900degC (_T_ = Pd) or 12 days at 1000degC (_T_ = Ni). X-ray diffraction patterns were indexed to the hexagonal PrNi2Al3-type crystal structure with the space group P6/_mmm_ and lattice parameters a = 5,217 A and c = 4.024 A for UNi2Al3 and a = 5.419 A and c = 4.052 A for UPd2Al3. The electrical resistivity was measured in a "He-"He dilution refrigerator using an LR 201 four-lead ac nano-ohmmeter operating at 16 Hz and a measuring current density of ~ 8 mA/cm2. The applied magnetic field was produced using a superconducting solenoid, and the superconducting critical temperature _Tc_ was defined as the temperature at which the resistivity decreases to 50% of its extrapolated normal-state value.

Zero-field electrical resistivity r vs temperature T data between 1 and 10 K for UNi2Al3 are displayed in Fig. 1. In contrast to the data reported in Ref. 2 in which _r_(_T_) is linear down to _Tc_, Fig. 1 reveals a broad shoulder in _r_(_T_) in the vicinity of _T_N followed by a transition to the superconducting state at _Tc_ ~ 1 K. The value of _T_N_ ~ 4.6 K, defined as the temperature corresponding to the minimum in the _d_r_/_dT_ vs T curve shown in the inset of Fig. 1, is in excellent agreement with the Neel temperature of the U moments estimated from specific heat and magnetization measurements.2

Shown in Fig. 2 are r vs T data for UPd2Al3 below 25 K. There is an abrupt and large decrease in _r_(_T_) at T _N_ ~ 15 K due to the onset of U long-range antiferromagnetic order followed by a transition to the superconducting state at _Tc_ ~ 2 K. An excellent fit to the data between 2 and 15 K can be achieved using the sum of an expression appropriate for an antiferromagnet with an energy gap [9] and a T^{2} term reflecting Fermi-liquid behavior,

\[\rho = \rho_{0} + bT\left[ {1 + 2T/\Delta} \right]\exp\left( {- \Delta/T} \right) + cT^{2}\ .\] (1)

The parameters \rho_{0} = 1\mu\Omega cm, b = 24\mu\Omega cm/K, \Delta = 40 K, and c = 0.23\mu\Omega cm/K^{2} were obtained from the fit. It is interesting to note that even though \rho(T) in URu_{2}Si_{2} is also described by Eq. (1), a narrow peak associated with the spin-density-wave transition develops in the vicinity of T_{N} = 17.5 K in URu_{2}Si_{2} but is absent in UPd_{2}Al_{3}. The increase of \rho with decreasing T around T_{N} was first recognized in Cr as being due to the formation of an energy gap on the Fermi surface, which decreases the effective number of carriers [10]. A possible reason for the absence of a peak at T_{N} in UPd_{2}Al_{3} could be the combined effects of the larger c parameter and the greater fraction of ungapped electron states [11] than in URu_{2}Si_{2}. In contrast to UPd_{2}Al_{3}, the \rho(T) magnetic anomaly is considerably smaller and smeared out in UNi_{2}Al_{3}. A plot of d\rho/dT vs T, shown in the inset of Fig. 1, reveals a T dependence reminiscent of URu_{2}Si_{2} in that \rho first decreases rapidly upon lowering T from above T_{N}, then less quickly as T \rightarrow T_{N}, and finally decreases rapidly again with decreasing T below T_{N}. There is a small change in the electronic specific-heat coefficient \gamma from 150 to 120 mJ/mol K^{2} in UNi_{2}Al_{3} as T is cooled through T_{N}[2]. The reason for the small size of the magnetic anomaly in UNi_{2}Al_{3} is not yet understood. However, it is well known that no feature at all has been seen at T_{N} \approx 5 K in transport and bulk properties of the HF superconductor UPt_{3}, even though neutron-diffraction measurements show an ordered moment of (0.02\pm 0.01)\mu_{B}/U atom [12].

Representative resistive superconducting transition curves for applied fields up to 32 kOe are displayed in Figs. 3(a) and 4(a) for UNi_{2}Al_{3} and UPd_{2}Al_{3}, respectively. The \rho value of the UPd_{2}Al_{3} sample used for these measurements is one order of magnitude larger than that of the piece used for the normal-state resistivity, even

The solid line is a fit to the data that was calculated from the WHHM theory assuming only orbital pair breaking. The spin-orbit scattering parameter \lambda_{\rm so} consistent with this absence of paramagnetic limitation is also shown in the figure.

Figure 2: Low-temperature electrical resistivity vs temperature T of UPd_{2}Al_{3} in zero applied magnetic field. The solid line represents a fit of the equation \rho = \rho_{0} + bT\left[ {1 + 2T/\Delta} \right]\exp\left( {- \Delta/T} \right) + cT^{2} to the data with parameters \rho_{0}, b, \Delta, and c that are given in the text.

  though both pieces were cut from the same ingot. This discrepancy is likely due to macroscopic cracks present in the sample, which can be seen under the microscope. The upper critical field H_{c2}(T) curves extracted from the \rho(T,H) data are shown in Figs. 3(b) and 4(b).

The initial slopes of the H_{c2} vs T curves have the values \left(-dH_{c2}/dT\right)_{T_{c}} = 13 kOe/K for T = Ni and 43 kOe/K for T = Pd, which can be used to estimate \xi_{0} the superconducting coherence length at T = 0 K. The zero-temperature orbital critical magnetic field H_{c2}^{\bullet}(0) can be determined from the weak-coupling formula [15]

\[H_{c2}^{\bullet}(0) = 0.693\left[\left(-dH_{c2}/dT\right)_{T_{c}}\right]T_{c}\ ,\] (2)

which gives H_{c2}^{\bullet}(0) \sim 9.1 kOe for UNi_{2}Al_{3} (T_{c} = 1.02 K) and \sim 57.5 kOe for UPd_{2}Al_{3} (T_{c} = 1.93 K). These values can then be used to calculate the Ginzburg-Landau coherence lengths using the following expression:

\[H_{c2}^{\bullet}(0) = \frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi_{0}^{2}}\ ,\] (3)

where \Phi_{0} = _hc_ /_2e_ = 2.07 x 10-7 Oe cm2 is the flux quantum. The calculations give \xi_{0} = 190 A for T = Ni and \xi_{0} = 77 A for T = Pd.

The paramagnetic limiting field at T = 0 K, H_{p0} in the absence of spin-orbit scattering, is given by

\[H_{p0}(0) = 18.4T_{c}\ (\mathrm{kOe})\] (4)

which yields H_{p0} = 18.7 kOe for T = Ni and H_{p0} = 35.5 kOe for T = Pd. It is interesting to note that H_{c2}(0) \approx H_{c2}^{\bullet}(0) for UNi_{2}Al_{3}, whereas H_{c2}(0) \approx H_{p0} for UPd_{2}Al_{3}.

The coherence length can also be obtained from the BCS equation [14]

\[\xi_{0} = 0.18\frac{\pi w_{F}}{k_{B}T_{c}}\ .\] (5)

However, it is necessary to estimate the Fermi velocity v_{F} = \hbar k_{F}/m^{\bullet}, where k_{F} is the Fermi wave vector. Assuming a spherical Fermi surface, k_{F} = (3\pi^{2}Z/\Omega)^{1/3}, where Z is the number of conduction electrons per unit cell and \Omega is the unit-cell volume. As a rough approximation, we assume that there are three 5f electrons contributed by each U atom so that Z = 3, since there is one formula unit per unit cell. From the hexagonal lattice parameters determined from x-ray measurements, we find \Omega = 9.5\times 10^{-23} cm^{3} for UNi_{2}Al_{3} and \Omega = 10.29\times 10^{-23} cm^{3} for UPd_{2}Al_{3}. We then obtain k_{F} = 9.78\times 10^{7} cm^{-1} and 9.52\times 10^{7} cm^{-1}, respectively. The effective mass can be deduced from the relation

\[m^{\bullet} = \frac{\pi^{2}k_{F}^{2}}{\pi^{2}(Z/\Omega)k_{B}^{2}}\ ,\] (6)

which gives m^{\bullet} = 41m_{\bullet} for T = Ni and m^{\bullet} = 49m_{\bullet} for T = Pd  T_{N}\!=\!14 K in UPd_{2}Al_{3} appears to involve a gap \Delta\!\approx\!40 K opening over \sim\!30\% of the Fermi surface. The AFM ordering anomaly at T_{N}\!=\!4.6 K in UNi_{2}Al_{3} is smeared out and is less pronounced than in UPd_{2}Al_{3}.

###### Abstract

The resistive upper critical field _H_c2 as a function of temperature T has been determined for polycrystalline specimens of the isostructural antiferromagnetic heavy-fermion superconductors UT2Al3 (_T_ = Ni, Pd). The zero-temperature superconducting coherence lengths g0 = 190 A (77 A) for T = Ni (Pd) have been estimated from the initial slope of _H_c2(_T_), and analyses of previously reported specific-heat data yield an effective mass enhancement m * / m ~ 40 (49) for T = Ni (Pd), where m is the free-electron mass. High-precision measurements of the normal-state electrical resistivity reveal a broad anomaly below 4.6 K in UNi2Al3, which correlates with the onset of U-moment antiferromagnetic ordering. In UPd2Al3, the large electrical resistivity drop between _Tc_ and T _N_ = 15 K can be accurately described by an expression that is appropriate for an antiferromagnet with an energy gap D ~ 40 K and an additional T2 term reflecting Fermi-liquid behavior.

The polycrystalline specimens of UT2Al3 (_T_ = Ni,Pd) were prepared by arc melting in an argon atmosphere and were then vacuum annealed for either 8 days at 900degC (_T_ = Pd) or 12 days at 1000degC (_T_ = Ni). X-ray diffraction patterns were indexed to the hexagonal PrNi2Al3-type crystal structure with the space group P6/_mmm_ and lattice parameters a = 5,217 A and c = 4.024 A for UNi2Al3 and a = 5.419 A and c = 4.052 A for UPd2Al3. The electrical resistivity was measured in a "He-"He dilution refrigerator using an LR 201 four-lead ac nano-ohmmeter operating at 16 Hz and a measuring current density of ~ 8 mA/cm2. The applied magnetic field was produced using a superconducting solenoid, and the superconducting critical temperature _Tc_ was defined as the temperature at which the resistivity decreases to 50% of its extrapolated normal-state value.

Zero-field electrical resistivity r vs temperature T data between 1 and 10 K for UNi2Al3 are displayed in Fig. 1. In contrast to the data reported in Ref. 2 in which _r_(_T_) is linear down to _Tc_, Fig. 1 reveals a broad shoulder in _r_(_T_) in the vicinity of _T_N followed by a transition to the superconducting state at _Tc_ ~ 1 K. The value of _T_N_ ~ 4.6 K, defined as the temperature corresponding to the minimum in the _d_r_/_dT_ vs T curve shown in the inset of Fig. 1, is in excellent agreement with the Neel temperature of the U moments estimated from specific heat and magnetization measurements.2

Shown in Fig. 2 are r vs T data for UPd2Al3 below 25 K. There is an abrupt and large decrease in _r_(_T_) at T _N_ ~ 15 K due to the onset of U long-range antiferromagnetic order followed by a transition to the superconducting state at _Tc_ ~ 2 K. An excellent fit to the data between 2 and 15 K can be achieved using the sum of an expression appropriate for an antiferromagnet with an energy gap [9] and a T^{2} term reflecting Fermi-liquid behavior,

\[\rho = \rho_{0} + bT\left[ {1 + 2T/\Delta} \right]\exp\left( {- \Delta/T} \right) + cT^{2}\ .\] (1)

The parameters \rho_{0} = 1\mu\Omega cm, b = 24\mu\Omega cm/K, \Delta = 40 K, and c = 0.23\mu\Omega cm/K^{2} were obtained from the fit. It is interesting to note that even though \rho(T) in URu_{2}Si_{2} is also described by Eq. (1), a narrow peak associated with the spin-density-wave transition develops in the vicinity of T_{N} = 17.5 K in URu_{2}Si_{2} but is absent in UPd_{2}Al_{3}. The increase of \rho with decreasing T around T_{N} was first recognized in Cr as being due to the formation of an energy gap on the Fermi surface, which decreases the effective number of carriers [10]. A possible reason for the absence of a peak at T_{N} in UPd_{2}Al_{3} could be the combined effects of the larger c parameter and the greater fraction of ungapped electron states [11] than in URu_{2}Si_{2}. In contrast to UPd_{2}Al_{3}, the \rho(T) magnetic anomaly is considerably smaller and smeared out in UNi_{2}Al_{3}. A plot of d\rho/dT vs T, shown in the inset of Fig. 1, reveals a T dependence reminiscent of URu_{2}Si_{2} in that \rho first decreases rapidly upon lowering T from above T_{N}, then less quickly as T \rightarrow T_{N}, and finally decreases rapidly again with decreasing T below T_{N}. There is a small change in the electronic specific-heat coefficient \gamma from 150 to 120 mJ/mol K^{2} in UNi_{2}Al_{3} as T is cooled through T_{N}[2]. The reason for the small size of the magnetic anomaly in UNi_{2}Al_{3} is not yet understood. However, it is well known that no feature at all has been seen at T_{N} \approx 5 K in transport and bulk properties of the HF superconductor UPt_{3}, even though neutron-diffraction measurements show an ordered moment of (0.02\pm 0.01)\mu_{B}/U atom [12].

Representative resistive superconducting transition curves for applied fields up to 32 kOe are displayed in Figs. 3(a) and 4(a) for UNi_{2}Al_{3} and UPd_{2}Al_{3}, respectively. The \rho value of the UPd_{2}Al_{3} sample used for these measurements is one order of magnitude larger than that of the piece used for the normal-state resistivity, even

The solid line is a fit to the data that was calculated from the WHHM theory assuming only orbital pair breaking. The spin-orbit scattering parameter \lambda_{\rm so} consistent with this absence of paramagnetic limitation is also shown in the figure.

The solid line represents a fit of the equation \rho = \rho_{0} + bT\left[ {1 + 2T/\Delta} \right]\exp\left( {- \Delta/T} \right) + cT^{2} to the data with parameters \rho_{0}, b, \Delta, and c that are given in the text.

  though both pieces were cut from the same ingot. This discrepancy is likely due to macroscopic cracks present in the sample, which can be seen under the microscope. The upper critical field H_{c2}(T) curves extracted from the \rho(T,H) data are shown in Figs. 3(b) and 4(b).

The initial slopes of the H_{c2} vs T curves have the values \left(-dH_{c2}/dT\right)_{T_{c}} = 13 kOe/K for T = Ni and 43 kOe/K for T = Pd, which can be used to estimate \xi_{0} the superconducting coherence length at T = 0 K. The zero-temperature orbital critical magnetic field H_{c2}^{\bullet}(0) can be determined from the weak-coupling formula [15]

\[H_{c2}^{\bullet}(0) = 0.693\left[\left(-dH_{c2}/dT\right)_{T_{c}}\right]T_{c}\ ,\] (2)

which gives H_{c2}^{\bullet}(0) \sim 9.1 kOe for UNi_{2}Al_{3} (T_{c} = 1.02 K) and \sim 57.5 kOe for UPd_{2}Al_{3} (T_{c} = 1.93 K). These values can then be used to calculate the Ginzburg-Landau coherence lengths using the following expression:

\[H_{c2}^{\bullet}(0) = \frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi_{0}^{2}}\ ,\] (3)

where \Phi_{0} = _hc_ /_2e_ = 2.07 x 10-7 Oe cm2 is the flux quantum. The calculations give \xi_{0} = 190 A for T = Ni and \xi_{0} = 77 A for T = Pd.

The paramagnetic limiting field at T = 0 K, H_{p0} in the absence of spin-orbit scattering, is given by

\[H_{p0}(0) = 18.4T_{c}\ (\mathrm{kOe})\] (4)

which yields H_{p0} = 18.7 kOe for T = Ni and H_{p0} = 35.5 kOe for T = Pd. It is interesting to note that H_{c2}(0) \approx H_{c2}^{\bullet}(0) for UNi_{2}Al_{3}, whereas H_{c2}(0) \approx H_{p0} for UPd_{2}Al_{3}.

The coherence length can also be obtained from the BCS equation [14]

\[\xi_{0} = 0.18\frac{\pi w_{F}}{k_{B}T_{c}}\ .\] (5)

However, it is necessary to estimate the Fermi velocity v_{F} = \hbar k_{F}/m^{\bullet}, where k_{F} is the Fermi wave vector. Assuming a spherical Fermi surface, k_{F} = (3\pi^{2}Z/\Omega)^{1/3}, where Z is the number of conduction electrons per unit cell and \Omega is the unit-cell volume. As a rough approximation, we assume that there are three 5f electrons contributed by each U atom so that Z = 3, since there is one formula unit per unit cell. From the hexagonal lattice parameters determined from x-ray measurements, we find \Omega = 9.5\times 10^{-23} cm^{3} for UNi_{2}Al_{3} and \Omega = 10.29\times 10^{-23} cm^{3} for UPd_{2}Al_{3}. We then obtain k_{F} = 9.78\times 10^{7} cm^{-1} and 9.52\times 10^{7} cm^{-1}, respectively. The effective mass can be deduced from the relation

\[m^{\bullet} = \frac{\pi^{2}k_{F}^{2}}{\pi^{2}(Z/\Omega)k_{B}^{2}}\ ,\] (6)

which gives m^{\bullet} = 41m_{\bullet} for T = Ni and m^{\bullet} = 49m_{\bullet} for T = Pd  T_{N}\!=\!14 K in UPd_{2}Al_{3} appears to involve a gap \Delta\!\approx\!40 K opening over \sim\!30\% of the Fermi surface. The AFM ordering anomaly at T_{N}\!=\!4.6 K in UNi_{2}Al_{3} is smeared out and is less pronounced than in UPd_{2}Al_{3}.
