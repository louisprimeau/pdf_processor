###### Abstract

The synthesis and crystallography, magnetic susceptibility _kh_, magnetization M, specific heat _C_p, in-plane electrical resistivity _ρ_, and in-plane magnetic penetration depth measurements are reported for single crystals of \mathbf{APd_{2}As_{2}} (_A_ = Ca, Sr, Ba) versus temperature T and magnetic field H. The crystals were grown using PdAs self-flux. CaPd2As2 and SrPd2As2 crystallize in a collapsed body-centered tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type structure (I4/mmm), whereas BaPd2As2 crystallizes in the primitive tetragonal CeMg2Si2-type structure (P4/mmm), in agreement with literature data. The _ρ_(_T_) data exhibit metallic behavior for all three compounds. Bulk superconductivity is reported for CaPd2As2 and SrPd2As2 below _T_c = 1.27 and 0.92 K, respectively, whereas only a trace of superconductivity is found in BaPd2As2. No other phase transitions were observed. The _kh_(_T_) and _M_(_H_) data reveal anisotropic diamagnetism in the normal state, with _khc_ > _khd_ for CaPd2As2 and BaPd2As2, and _khc_ < _khd_ for SrPd2As2. The normal and superconducting state data indicate that CaPd2As2 and SrPd2As2 are conventional type-II nodeless _s_-wave electron-phonon superconductors. The electronic superconducting state heat capacity data for CaPd2As2, which has an extremely sharp heat capacity jump at _T_c, are analyzed using our recent elaboration of the _a_-model of the BCS theory of superconductivity, which indicates that the _s_-wave gap in this compound is anisotropic in momentum space.

## I Introduction

The observation of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) with transition temperatures _T_c \lesssim 38 K in doped 122-type iron arsenides such as in A_{1-x}K_{x}Fe2As2 (_A_ = Ba, Sr, Ca, and Eu) compounds has stimulated great interest in these materials.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] The parent compounds _A_Fe2As2 with A = Ca, Sr, and Ba are itinerant antiferromagnetic (AF) semimetals that undergo a structural distortion from a tetragonal structure to an orthorhombic one on cooling below room temperature. On cooling, the structural transition is concident with or precedes a long-range AF itinerant spin density wave (SDW) transition. Superconductivity in these compounds emerges upon suppression of the SDW transition that can be achieved either by partial chemical substitutions at either the A, Fe, or As sites or by application of external pressure.[11] The same phenomenology is found in the high-_T_c cuprates where the long-range AF order must be largely suppressed by doping prior to the emergence of superconductivity, but strong dynamic AF spin fluctuations must still be present. Thus, the iron arsenides and the high-_T_c cuprates have a similar generic phase diagram for the emergence of superconductivity, even though the cuprate parent compounds are AF insulators rather than SDW semimetals.[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]

The partial substitutions at the Fe-site in \mathit{AE}_{\text{2}}As2 by transition metals M in Ba(Fe1-_x_M_x)2As2 with M = Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, and Pd have recently been studied both theoretically and experimentally from the perspective of the degree of charge doping because of the changes in the magnetic and SC properties caused by such substitutions.[6, 12, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 6  atoms in CaPd_{2}As_{2} form a body-centered tetragonal sublattice, in the BaPd_{2}As_{2} structure the Ba atoms form a primitive tetragonal sublattice. Furthermore, the fourfold coordination of Pdy As is tetrahedral in CaPd_{2}As_{2} but is planar rectangular in BaPd_{2}As_{2}. The BaPd_{2}As_{2} structure can be derived from that of CaPd_{2}As_{2} by a [\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0] translation of the central As-Ca-As layer. Superconductivity was recently reported below T_{\rm c}=3.0 K in the similar compound SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} with the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure.[45]

In this paper we report crystallographic investigations of crushed single crystal powders and physical property measurements of single crystals of the three (Ca,Sr,Ba)Pd_{2}As_{2} compounds using magnetic susceptibility \chi, isothermal magnetization M, specific heat C_{\rm p}, ab-plane electrical resistivity \rho and magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{\rm eff} measurements as a function of temperature T and applied magnetic field H. The published structures of these compounds are confirmed. The \rho(T), \chi(T), and C_{\rm p}(T) data demonstrate that all three compounds are sp-band-like metals. The \chi(T) data indicate anisotropic diamagnetic behavior in all three compounds with \chi_{c}>\chi_{ab} for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and BaPd_{2}As_{2} and \chi_{c}<\chi_{ab} for SrPd_{2}As_{2}. Bulk superconducting transitions at T_{\rm c}=1.27(3) K for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and T_{\rm c}=0.92(5) K for SrPd_{2}As_{2} are also reported together with other superconducting state properties derived from the above measurements. We analyzed the superconducting state electronic entropy and heat capacity data using our recent elaboration of the \alpha-model of the BCS theory of superconductivity.[46] The data indicate that CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2} are both conventional nodeless type-II electron-phonon superconductors, but with anisotropic s-wave gaps. Filamentary superconductivity was also detected below 2.0 K in BaPd_{2}As_{2}.

The experimental details are described in Sec. II. The crystallographic studies of CaPd_{2}As_{2}, SrPd_{2}As_{2}, and BaPd_{2}As_{2} are presented in Sec. III. The superconducting and normal-state properties of CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2} are given in Secs. IV and V, respectively, and the measurements of their superconducting magnetic penetration depths versus temperature are presented in Sec. VI. The normal-state properties of BaPd_{2}As_{2} are presented in Sec. VII. A summary of the experimental results and analyses and the conclusions is given in Sec. VIII.

## II Experimental Details

Single crystals of APd_{2}As_{2} (A= Ba, Ca, Sr) were grown using PdAs flux. The starting materials were high-purity elemental Ca (99.98%), Pd (99.998%), and As (99.9999%) from Alfa Aesar and Sr (99.95%) and Ba (99.99%) from Sigma Aldrich. The Ca, Sr, or Ba and prereacted PdAs flux taken in a 1:4 molar ratio were placed in alumina crucibles and sealed inside evacuated fused silica tubes. The sealed samples were heated to 1100 degC at a rate of 60-80 degC/h and held there for 12 h. After cooling at a rate of 2.5 degC/h to 800 degC, shiny platelike crystals of typical size 2\times 1.5\times 0.4 mm^{3} were separated by decanting the flux with a centrifuge at that temperature.

The phase purity and the chemical composition of the CaPd_{2}As_{2}, SrPd_{2}As_{2}, and BaPd_{2}As_{2} crystals were measured using a JEOL scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive x-ray analyzer (EDX). High-resolution SEM images demonstrated that the crystals were single phase. The EDX analyses of two or three single crystals of each compound were consistent with the ideal 1 : 2 : 2 stoichiometry. The crystal structures of the samples were determined by Rietveld refinements of powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) data for crushed single crystals collected on a Rigaku Geigerflex x-ray diffractometer using Cu K_{\alpha} radiation. The Rietveld refinements were carried out using the fullprof software[47] which also confirmed the single-phase nature of the crystals.

The magnetization measurements were performed using a Quantum Design, Inc., superconducting quantum interference device magnetic properties measurement system (MPMS). We use Gaussian cgs units for the magnetic results and discussion, where the unit of magnetic field H is the Oe = G, but we also use the Tesla, with 1 T = 10^{4} Oe, as a unit of convenience (the magnetic moment output by the MPMS software is in Gaussian cgs units where 1 emu = 1 G cm^{3}).[11] In order to obtain the magnetic moment of the crystals in a particular field H we subtracted the precalibrated magnetic moment of the sample holder (quartz rod/plastic piece and GE varnish that were used to mount the sample for MPMS measurements) in the same H. Due to the small magnitudes of the magnetic moments of the small crystals and the uncertainty in the magnetic moment of the sample holder, the accuracy of the M(H,T) and \chi(T) data of the samples reported here is of order 10%.

The heat capacity measurements were carried out using the relaxation method in a Quantum Design, Inc., physical properties measurement system (PPMS). Temperatures down to 0.45 K were obtained using a ^{3}He attachment to the PPMS. The ab-plane \rho(T) measurements were performed by the standard four-probe ac technique using the ac transport option of the PPMS. The electrical leads were 25 \mum diameter platinum wires attached to the crystals with EPO-TEK P1011 silver epoxy cured at 110 degC for 1 h. The accuracy of \rho is of order 10% due to uncertainties in the geometric factor.

The temperature variation of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{\rm eff} was measured using a tunnel diode resonator (TDR) technique operating at about 15 MHz. The resonator consists

  of an LC tank circuit with a single-layer coil of inductance L\sim 1\muH, a capacitor with capacitance C\sim 100 pF, and a tunnel diode that is biased to the region of negative differential resistance, thus compensating the losses in the circuit. The circuit, therefore, self-oscillates at a frequency f=(2\pi\sqrt{LC})^{-1}. When a sample with magnetic susceptibility \chi is inserted into the coil, the total inductance changes and the resonant frequency shifts accordingly by an amount which is proportional to \chi. The temperature dependence of the resonance frequency shift \Delta f(T) induced by changes in the sample's magnetic response is related to the magnetic susceptibility \chi and hence \lambda_{\rm eff}(T) by [48; 49; 50]

\[\Delta f(T) = -4\pi\,\chi(T)G\] (1) \[\approx -G\,\left\{1-\frac{\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)}{L_{\rm eff}}\tanh\left[ \frac{L_{\rm eff}}{\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)}\right]\right\}\,,\]

where G is a sample- and coil-dependent calibration constant and L_{\rm eff} is the effective sample dimension. [48] The value of G is determined experimentally by pulling the sample out of the coil _in situ_ and measuring the total associated frequency shift \Delta f_{0} so that \Delta\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)=L_{\rm eff}\delta f(T)/\Delta f_{0} where \Delta\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)=\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)-\lambda_{\rm eff}(T_{\rm min}), \delta f(T)=f(T)-f(T_{\rm min}), and T_{\rm min} is the minimum temperature of the measurement. [48] Another way to determine G is by matching the temperature dependence of the skin depth d(T) obtained from the resonator response in the normal state to the measured resistivity \rho(T) by using the relation \delta(T)=(c/2\pi)\sqrt{\rho(T)/f}. [51] The ac magnetic field was applied along the c axis of single crystals of CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2}, so the reported penetration depths are the respective values in the ab plane.

## III Crystallography

The room temperature powder XRD patterns for crushed single crystals of CaPd_{2}As_{2}, SrPd_{2}As_{2}, and BaPd_{2}As_{2} are shown in Figs. 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c), respectively. The weak unindexed peaks marked with stars for BaPd_{2}As_{2} arise from the small amount of flux attached to the surface of the crystals prior to crushing them for the measurements. The Rietveld refinements confirmed the reported ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type body-centered tetragonal structure (space group I4/mmm) of CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2} and the CeMg_{2}Si_{2}-type primitive tetragonal structure (space group P4/mmm) of BaPd_{2}As_{2}. [43; 44]

The refinement profiles for these structural models are shown in Fig. 2. During the final refinements, the thermal parameters B were set to B=0 and the occupancies of the respective atomic sites were fixed to unity since there were no improvements in the quality of fits or significant changes in the lattice parameters or in the As c-axis position parameter z_{\rm As} upon making small changes in B and in the occupancies. The crystallographic and refinement parameters are listed in Tables 1 and 2. For comparison the lattice parameters and z_{\rm As} values from the literature are also listed in Table 1, where good agreement is found.

The c/a ratio and the interlayer As-As distance d_{\rm As-As}=(1-2z_{\rm As})c for (\rm Ca_{x}Sr)Pd_{2}As_{2} and d_{\rm As-As}=2z_{\rm As}c for BaPd_{2}As_{2} are listed in Table 1, where a "layer" is defined as an As-Pd-As slab in Fig. 1. The values of d_{\rm As-As} for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2} are close to the covalent single-bond distance of 2.38 A for As, [52] indicating that these two compounds have

The solid lines through the experimental points are the Rietveld refinement profiles calculated [(a) and (b)] for the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type body-centered tetragonal structure (space group I4/mmm), and (c) for the CeMg_{2}Si_{2}-type primitive tetragonal structure (space group P4/mmm). In (a), (b), and (c), the short vertical bars mark the fitted Bragg peak positions. The lowermost curves represent the differences between the experimental and calculated intensities. The unindexed peaks marked with stars in (c) are peaks from residual PdAs flux on the surface of the samples.

  cT structures.[40] Therefore, as discussed in Sec. I, the formal oxidation state of Pd in these (Ca,Sr)Pd_{2}As_{2} compounds is Pd^{+1}, which is the same formal oxidation state as for Cu in \mathrm{ThCr}_{2}Si_{2}-type SrCu_{2}As_{2}.[40]

## IV Physical properties of CaPd_{2}As_{2} crystals

### Electrical resistivity

The in-plane \rho of CaPd_{2}As_{2} versus T is shown for crystal #1 at H=0 in Fig. 3(a) and for crystal #2 under various H in Fig. 3(b). A sharp zero-field superconducting transition is observed in Fig. 3(b) at T_{\mathrm{c}}=1.28(3) K that is suppressed by H=0.14 T to below 0.45 K. For crystal #1, the superconducting onset is also at 1.8 K as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a). A broad superconducting transition was seen in another crystal (#3) with an onset at 1.8 K and zero resistance at 1.3 K (not shown). Interestingly, the \rho(T) of crystal #2 in Fig. 3(b) exhibits an upturn and peak before the resistivity drops due to superconductivity which is suppressed by a field H\gtrsim 0.08 T. The origin of this \rho(T) peak is not clear. For crystal #1 the residual resistivity at 2 K before entering the superconducting state is \rho_{0}=43\mu\Omega cm and the residual resistivity ratio is \mathrm{RRR}\equiv\rho(300 K)/\rho(2 K)\approx 3.

In the following we fit the normal-state \rho(T) data by the Bloch-Gruneisen (BG) model which describes the electrical resistivity \rho_{\mathrm{BG}}(T) due to scattering of the charge carriers by longitudinal acoustic lattice vibrations in the absence of Umklapp scattering, given by[53, 54]

\[\rho_{\mathrm{BG}}(T/\Theta_{\mathrm{R}})=4\mathcal{R}\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{ \mathrm{R}}}\right)^{5}\int_{0}^{\Theta_{\mathrm{R}}/T}\frac{x^{5}}{(e^{x}-1)( 1-e^{-x})}dx,\] (2a) where \[\Theta_{\mathrm{R}} is the Debye temperature obtained from fitting resistivity measurements, \[\mathcal{R}\] is a material-dependent prefactor that is independent of \[T\] , and \[\rho_{\mathrm{BG}}(T/\Theta_{R}=1)=0.946\,463\,5\,\mathcal{R}.\] (2b) The experimental \[\rho(T)\] data are fitted by \[\rho(T)=\rho_{0}+\rho(\Theta_{\mathrm{R}})\rho_{\mathrm{R}}(T/\Theta_{\mathrm{ R}}),\] (2c)

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c}  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Wyckoff} & & \\ Atom & symbol & x & y & z \\ \hline CaPd_{2}As_{2} (I4/mmm) & & & & \\ Ca & 2a & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ Pd & 4d & 0 & 1/2 & 1/4 \\ As & 4e & 0 & 0 & 0.3763(3) \\ SrPd_{2}As_{2} (I4/mmm) & & & & \\ Sr & 2a & 0 &  where Eq. (2a) yields the normalized dimensionless BG resistivity

\[\rho_{\rm n}(T/\Theta_{\rm R}) = 4.226\,259\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{\rm R}}\right)^{5}\] (2d) \[\times\int_{0}^{\Theta_{\rm R}/T}\frac{x^{5}}{(e^{\rm c}-1)(1-e^{- x_{\rm c}})}dx.\]

An excellent fit of the \rho(T) data by Eqs. (2) was obtained using the three independent fitting parameters \rho_{0}, \rho(\Theta_{\rm R}), and \Theta_{\rm R} for 2 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K, as shown by the red curve in Fig. 3(a). The single parameter \Theta_{\rm R} determines the T dependence of the fit. While fitting the \rho(T) data we used the analytic Pade approximant function \rho_{\rm n}(T/\Theta_{\rm R}) in place of Eq. (2d) developed in Ref. [54] which accurately describes \rho_{\rm n}(T/\Theta_{\rm R}) and greatly simplifies least-squares fitting of experimental \rho(T) data by the BG theory. The fitting parameters are summarized in Table 3 along with those of the other two compounds discussed below. The \mathcal{R} value is obtained from the fitted value of \rho(\Theta_{\rm R}) using Eq. (2b).

### Heat capacity

#### iii.2.1 Overview of the superconducting and normal-state heat capacity

The C_{\rm p}(T) of a CaPd_{2}As_{2} crystal is shown in Fig. 4 for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K. As shown in the expanded plot of the low-T data in the inset of Fig. 4, a sharp jump is observed in C_{\rm p}(T) due to the occurrence of superconductivity at

The red solid curve is the fitted sum of the contributions from the Debye lattice heat capacity C_{\rm V-D Debye}(T) and predetermined electronic heat capacity \gamma_{\rm x}T according to Eq. (5a). Inset: C_{\rm p}/ TV vs T for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 2.5 K. The dotted red vertical line indicates the T_{\rm c}.

The red curve is a fit by the Bloch-Grüneisen model in the T range 2–300 K. Inset: Expanded plot of \rho(T) below 10 K to show the onset of superconductivity at 2.0 K. (b) Expanded plot of \rho(T) of CaPd_{2}As_{2} crystal \#2 for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 2.5 K showing the superconducting transition for different values of H, as listed, applied along the c axis.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c}  & \rho_{0} & \Theta_{\rm R} & \rho(\Theta_{\rm R}) & \mathcal{R} \\ Compound & (\mu\Omega cm) & (K) & (\mu\Omega cm) & (\mu\Omega cm) \\ \hline CaPd_{2}As_{2} & 42.60(7) & 135(3) & 30.3(5) & 32.0 \\ SrPd_{2}As_{2} & 7.57(6) & 170(3) & 27.6(5) & 29.2 \\ BaPd_{2}As_{2} & 1.02(1) & 114(1) & 8.84(1) & 9.34 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Parameters derived from Bloch-Grüneisen fits to the resistivities \rho within the ab plane of the listed single crystals obtained using Eqs. (2). Here \rho_{0} is the residual resistivity extrapolated to T=0, \Theta_{\rm R} is the Debye temperature determined from resistivity measurements, \rho(\Theta_{\rm R}) is the fitted value of \rho at T=\Theta_{\rm R}, and \mathcal{R} is obtained from the fitted value of \rho(\Theta_{\rm R}) using Eq. (2b). The \rho and \mathcal{R} values do not take into account the systematic error of order 10% arising from uncertainties in the geometric factor required to calculate \rho of a crystal from its measured resistance. The accuracy of \Theta_{\rm R} is not affected by this systematic error since this parameter is determined solely from the T dependence of \rho.

  T_{\rm c}=1.27(3) K. The C_{\rm p}(T) data measured under various H are shown in Fig. 5(a). These data show that the T_{\rm c} decreases with increasing H and is suppressed to below 0.45 K by H=0.15 T.

Plots of C_{\rm p}/T versus T^{2} for H=0 and 0.15 T are shown in Fig. 5(b). We analyzed the normal-state C_{\rm p}(T) data at 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4.5 K for H=0.15 T and the data at 1.5 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4.5 K for H=0 together according to

\[\frac{C_{\rm p}(T)}{T}=\gamma_{\rm n}+\beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4},\] (3)

where \gamma_{\rm n} is the normal-state Sommerfeld electronic heat capacity coefficient, \beta is the Debye T^{3}-law lattice heat capacity coefficient, and \delta T^{4} is a higher-order lattice contribution. A fit of the normal-state data by Eq. (3), shown as the blue curve in Fig. 5(b), gives \gamma_{\rm n}=6.52(2) mJ/mol K^{2}, \beta=0.463(6) mJ/mol K^{4}, and \delta=6.8(4)\muJ/mol K^{6}. We estimate the Debye temperature \Theta_{\rm D} from \beta using the relation [55]

\[\Theta_{\rm D}=\left(\frac{12\pi^{4}Rn}{5\beta}\right)^{1/3},\] (4)

where R is the molar gas constant and n=5 is the number of atoms per formula unit (f.u.), yielding \Theta_{\rm D}=276(1) K.

The measured normal-state C_{\rm p}(T=300 K)=123 J/mol K in Fig. 4 is close to the expected classical Dulong-Petit high-T limiting value C_{\rm V}=3n\,R=15R=124.7 J/mol K at constant volume due to acoustic lattice vibrations. [55, 56] Our normal-state C_{\rm p}(T) data for the T range 2.5 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K were fitted by the sum of the above electronic term \gamma_{\rm n}T and the Debye model lattice heat capacity C_{\rm V\,Debye}(T) per mole of atoms due to acoustic lattice vibrations according to

\[C_{\rm p}(T)=\gamma_{\rm n}T+nC_{\rm V\,Debye}(T/\Theta_{\rm D}),\] (5a) where [56] \[C_{\rm V\,Debye}(T/\Theta_{\rm D})=9R\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{\rm D}}\right)^{3} \int_{0}^{\Theta_{\rm D}/T}\frac{x^{4}e^{x}}{(e^{x}-1)^{2}}\,dx\] (5b) and \[C_{\rm V\,Debye}(T/\Theta_{\rm D}=1) =9R\int_{0}^{1}\frac{x^{4}e^{x}}{(e^{x}-1)^{2}}\,dx\] (5c) \[\approx 2.8552\,R.\]

The integral in Eq. (5c) can be obtained in closed form but the expression is cumbersome. When carrying out the least-squares fit of the experimental C_{\rm p}(T) data by Eqs. (5) we used the high-accuracy analytic Pade approximant for C_{\rm V\,Debye}(T/\Theta_{\rm D}) in Eq. (5b) which we formulated in Ref. [54] that greatly simplifies the fit. The fit was carried out using the fixed value \gamma_{\rm n}=6.52 mJ/mol K^{2} obtained above. Thus, \Theta_{\rm D} is the only adjustable parameter. The fit yielded \Theta_{\rm D}=252(2) K and is shown by the red curve in Fig. 4. This value of \Theta_{\rm D} is close to but slightly smaller than the value \Theta_{\rm D}=276(1) K obtained above from analysis of the low-TC_{\rm p} data. Such differences are expected due to the T dependence of \Theta_{\rm D}. [54, 56]

We estimate the density of states at the Fermi energy for both spin directions obtained from heat capacity measurements \mathcal{D}_{\rm C}(E_{\rm F}) using the relation [55]

\[\gamma_{\rm n}=\frac{\pi^{2}k_{\rm B}^{2}}{3}\,\mathcal{D}_{C}(E_{\rm F}).\] (6)

This \mathcal{D}_{C}(E_{\rm F}) contains the enhancement from the many-body electron-phonon interaction \lambda_{\rm el-ph}. This is also the density of states that enters the BCS equations for T_{\rm c} and for the BCS gap and thermodynamic properties versus T. Using the above \gamma_{\rm n} value gives

\[\mathcal{D}_{C}(E_{\rm F})=2.76\ \ \mathrm{states}/\mathrm{eV}\,\mathrm{f.u.}\] (7)

The enhancements of the bare (band structure) density of states \mathcal{D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F}) and the bare effective mass m_{\rm band}^{*} due to the electron-phonon interaction are [57]

\[\mathcal{D}_{C}(E_{\rm F}) =\mathcal{D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})(1+\lambda_{\rm el-ph}),\] (8a) \[m^{*} =m_{\rm band}^{*}(1+\lambda_{\rm el-ph}),\] (8b)

where \lambda_{\rm el-ph} is the electron-phonon coupling constant.

Figure 5: (Color online) (a) Heat capacity C_{\rm p} versus temperature T of a CaPd_{2}As_{2} single crystal [crystal #2 of Fig. 3(b)] for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 2.0 K measured in different magnetic fields H applied along the c axis. (b) C_{\rm p}/T versus T^{2} for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 3.2 K with H=0 and 0.15 T. The blue curve is a fit of the H=0.15 T data for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4.5 K together with the H=0 data for 1.5 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4.5 K by Eq. (3).

  The \lambda_{\rm el-ph} value can be estimated from McMillan's theory[58] for the electron-phonon mechanism of superconductivity and is related to \Theta_{\rm D} and T_{\rm c} by

\[\lambda_{\rm el-ph}=\frac{1.04+\mu^{*}\ln(\Theta_{\rm D}/1.45\;T_{\rm c})}{(1-0 .62\mu^{*})\ln(\Theta_{\rm D}/1.45\;T_{\rm c})-1.04}.\] (9)

Here \mu^{*} is the repulsive screened Coulomb parameter having a value often between 0.1 and 0.15 and is usually taken as \mu^{*}=0.13. With this value of \mu^{*} together with T_{\rm c}=1.27 K and \Theta_{\rm D}=276 K as determined above (Table 4), Eqs. (8a) and (9) yield

\[\lambda_{\rm el-ph}=0.474,\quad{\cal D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})=1.87(1)\;\;{\rm states }/{\rm eV}\,{\rm f}.{\rm u}.\] (10)

The relatively small value of \lambda_{\rm el-ph} implies weak-coupling superconductivity in CaPd_{2}As_{2}.

A difference of \mu^{*} from the assumed value of 0.13 would give a different value of the calculated \lambda_{\rm el-ph}. For example, from Eq. (9) we obtain \lambda_{\rm el-ph}=0.421 if \mu^{*}=0.10 and \lambda_{\rm el-ph}=0.511 if \mu^{*}=0.15. Such differences would result in corresponding differences in the calculated {\cal D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F}). However, our value of {\cal D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F}) obtained below for the Sr compound using \mu^{*}=0.13 (Table 4) precisely agrees with the value {\cal D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})=1.93\;\;{\rm states}/{\rm eV} f.u. for both spin directions obtained from band calculations for this compound in the reference cited in the _Note added_ at the end of this paper. This agreement also indicates that electron correlation effects are not large, consistent with the sp-band-like nature of the APd_{2}As_{2} compounds that we deduce from the normal-state data.

The values of {\cal D}_{C}(E_{\rm F}), m^{*}, and \rho_{0} can be used to estimate the Fermi velocity (speed) v_{\rm F} and the mean-free path \ell for conduction carrier scattering at low T. In a single-band quasi-free-electron Fermi gas model, v_{\rm F} is[55]

\[v_{\rm F} = \frac{\pi^{2}\hbar^{3}}{m^{*2}V_{\rm f.u.}}{\cal D}_{C}(E_{\rm F})\] (11a) \[= \frac{\pi^{2}\hbar^{3}}{m^{*2}V_{\rm f.u.}}{\cal D}_{\rm band}(E _{\rm F})(1+\lambda_{\rm el-ph}),\] (11b)

where V_{\rm f.u.}=V_{\rm cell}/2 from Table 1 is the volume per formula unit and \hbar is Planck's constant divided by 2\pi. Assuming m^{*}_{\rm band}=m_{\rm e} where m_{\rm e} is the free-electron mass,[59] Eqs. (8b) and (11a) yield

\[v_{\rm F}=1.20\times 10^{8}\;{\rm cm}/{\rm s}.\] (12)

The mean-free path \ell=v_{\rm F}\tau, where \tau is the mean-free scattering time, is obtained from v_{\rm F} using[55]

\[\ell=3\pi^{2}\left(\frac{\hbar}{e^{2}\rho_{0}}\right)\left(\frac{\hbar}{m^{*} v_{\rm F}}\right)^{2},\] (13)

where \hbar/e^{2}=4108\;\Omega. From Eqs. (8), (11a), and (13), the value of m^{*}v_{\rm F} and hence of \ell is independent of \lambda_{\rm el-ph}. Using \rho_{0}=34.6\;\mu\Omega cm (for crystal No. 2), m^{*}_{\rm band}=m_{\rm e} and the value of v_{\rm F} in Eq. (12), Eqs. (8b) and (13) give

\[\ell=1.52\;{\rm nm},\] (14)

which is only 3.6 in-plane lattice constants (Table 1).

The plasma angular frequency \omega_{\rm p} of the conduction carriers can be estimated using the quasi-free-electron single-band relation

\[n=\frac{1}{3\pi^{2}}\left(\frac{m^{*}v_{\rm F}}{\hbar}\right)^{3},\] (15)

yielding[55]

\[\omega_{\rm p}^{2}=\frac{4\pi ne^{2}}{m^{*}}=\frac{4(m^{*}e)^{2}(v_{\rm F}/ \hbar)^{3}}{3\pi}.\] (16)

Using Eq. (8b), m^{*}_{\rm band}=m_{\rm e} and v_{\rm F} from Eq. (12) gives

\[  between the values of \Theta_{\rm D} and \Theta_{\rm R} for each compound indicate that the assumptions [54] of the BG theory are violated in the APd_{2}As_{2} compounds. The BG theory ignores Umklapp carrier scattering; if the Fermi wave vector k_{\rm F} is significantly smaller than the Debye wave vector k_{\rm D}, one might expect \Theta_{\rm D} and \Theta_{\rm R} to be significantly different; and a mechanism such as electron-electron scattering in addition to the electron-phonon scattering assumed in the BG theory could contribute to the T dependence of \rho.

#### iii.2.2 Superconducting state properties

The electronic contribution C_{\rm e}(T) to C_{\rm p}(T) of CaPd_{2}As_{2} obtained at low T by subtracting the low-T phonon contribution \beta T^{3}+\delta T^{5} from C_{\rm p}(T) is shown in Fig. 6(a). The large sharp jump \Delta C_{\rm e} in C_{\rm e} at T_{\rm c}=1.27(3) K indicates that the superconductivity in CaPd_{2}As_{2} is a bulk effect, confirmed below. The vertical heat capacity jump indicated by the vertical dotted line in Fig. 6(b) yields \Delta C_{\rm e}/T_{\rm c}=7.4(2) mJ/mol K^{2} and hence \Delta C_{\rm e}=9.4(3) mJ/mol K. Using the normal-state \gamma_{\rm n}=6.52(2) mJ/mol K^{2} from Table 4, one obtains \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c}=1.14(3) which is much smaller than the BCS value \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c}=1.43 in the weak-coupling limit. [46; 60] Because the bulk superconducting transition in C_{\rm e}(T) is very sharp, we infer that the reduction in \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c} from the BCS value is intrinsic. This reduction can happen if the superconducting gap (order parameter) is anisotropic in wave vector space, either from anisotropy in the gap on a single Fermi surface [46] or from multiple bands with distinct Fermi surfaces, each with a different isotropic or anisotropic gap, [61] as discussed in the context of the \alpha-model below.

#### iii.2.3 Value of \alpha within the \alpha-model

For simplicity, we analyze the zero-field superconducting state thermodynamic data for CaPd_{2}As_{2} within the framework of the so-called \alpha-model of the BCS theory of superconductivity, [46; 62; 63] where \alpha\equiv\Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}. In this model the normalized gap \tilde{\Delta}(T)\equiv\Delta(T)/\Delta(0) is the same as in the BCS theory which is calculated from the BCS gap equation [46; 62] with \alpha=\alpha_{\rm BCS} where

\[\alpha_{\rm BCS}=\pi\ e^{-\gamma_{\rm E}}\approx 1.7639\] (20)

and \gamma_{\rm E}\approx 0.5772 is Euler's constant. However, for calculating the thermodynamic properties, one uses a variable \alpha parameter, which represents an inconsistency in the model, but which allows one to fit superconducting state thermodynamic data that deviate from the BCS predictions. The superconducting and normal state electronic entropies at T_{\rm c} are the same, as in the BCS model, so the superconducting transition is still second order with no latent heat. One can interpret the quantitatively determined deviations from the BCS predictions in terms of other models and theories. For example, values \alpha>\alpha_{\rm BCS} can arise from the presence of strong electron-phonon coupling in contrast to the weak-coupling assumption in the BCS theory, [64] whereas \alpha<\alpha_{\rm BCS} can occur from gap anisotropy in momentum space [46] which we therefore assume is responsible for the reduced heat capacity jump in CaPd_{2}As_{2} compared to the BCS theory prediction.

The value of \alpha is related to the heat capacity jump at T_{\rm c} by [46]

\[\frac{\Delta C_{\rm e}(T_{\rm c})}{\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c}} = \frac{\Delta C_{\rm e}(T_{\rm c})}{\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c}}\bigg{|} _{\rm BCS}\left(\frac{\alpha}{\alpha_{\rm BCS}}\right)^{2}\] (21) \[= \frac{12}{7\zeta(3)}\left(\frac{\alpha}{\alpha_{\rm BCS}}\right)^ {2}\approx 1.426\left(\frac{\alpha}{\alpha_{\rm BCS}}\right)^{2},\]

where \zeta(x) is the Riemann zeta function. Inserting our normalized experimental heat capacity jump value into Eq. (21) gives

\[\alpha=1.58(2),\] (22)

which is significantly smaller than the BCS value of 1.764.

Figure 6: (Color online) (a) Electronic contribution C_{\rm e} to the heat capacity versus temperature T of CaPd_{2}As_{2}. (b) C_{\rm e}/T versus T. The solid red curve in each figure is the theoretical prediction of the \alpha-model in Eq. (23a) for \alpha=1.58. The BCS value is \alpha_{\rm BCS}\approx 1.764. The normal-state heat capacity is C_{\rm en}=\gamma_{\rm e}T with \gamma_{\rm n}=6.52 mJ/mol K^{2}. In (a), this normal-state contribution is the blue straight line and the extrapolation to low T is the dashed blue line. In (b), the normal-state behavior is C_{\rm en}/T=\gamma_{\rm n}.

  The temperature dependence of the superconducting state electronic heat capacity is calculated within the \alpha-model using [46]

\[\frac{C_{\rm es}(t)}{\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c}}=\frac{6\alpha^{3}}{\pi^{2}t}\int_{0 }^{\infty}f(1-f)\left(\frac{\tilde{E}^{2}}{t}-\frac{1}{2}\frac{d\tilde{\Delta}^ {2}}{dt}\right)d\tilde{\epsilon},\] (23a) where \[t=T/T_{\rm c}\] , the normalized normal-state electron energy is \[\tilde{\epsilon}=\epsilon/\Delta(0)\] , the normalized excited quasiparticle (electron and hole) energy is \[\tilde{E}=\frac{E}{\Delta(0)}=\sqrt{\tilde{\epsilon}^{2}+\tilde{\Delta}^{2}},\] (23b) and the Fermi-Dirac distribution function in the dimensionless variables is (with \[E_{\rm F}\equiv 0\] ) \[f\equiv f(\alpha,\tilde{E},t)=\frac{1}{e^{\alpha\tilde{E}/t}+1}\] with \[\frac{E}{k_{\rm B}T}=\frac{\alpha\tilde{E}}{t}.\] (23c)

The t-dependent \tilde{\Delta}(t) and d\tilde{\Delta}(t)/dt^{2} are calculated as described in Ref. [46].

The solid red curves in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) are the theoretical predictions for C_{\rm es}(T) and C_{\rm es}(T)/T, respectively, calculated from Eqs. (23) using \alpha=1.58 and are seen to be in good agreement with the data. The agreement of the lowest-T data with the theory indicates that there is no residual electronic specific heat for T\to 0, which in turn indicates that the entire sample is superconducting with a single nodeless s-wave gap and with a single T_{\rm c}. Because \alpha<\alpha_{\rm BCS}\approx 1.764, we infer that the s-wave order parameter is anisotropic in momentum space as discussed above. [46]

#### iii.1.4 Thermodynamic critical field H_{\rm c}

The experimental thermodynamic critical field H_{\rm c} versus T of a superconductor can be estimated using the zero-field C_{\rm c}(T) data via the electronic entropy difference between the normal (S_{\rm en}) and superconducting (S_{\rm es}) states per unit volume at H=0 according to the Clausius-Clapeyron-type relation [60, 65]

\[S_{\rm en}(T)-S_{\rm es}(T)=-\frac{1}{8\pi}\frac{dH_{\rm c}^{2}(T)}{dT},\] (24a) which, with \[S_{\rm e}(T^{\prime})=\int_{0}^{T^{\prime}}[C_{\rm e}(T^{\prime\prime})/T^{ \prime\prime})]dT^{\prime\prime}\] , yields \[H_{\rm c}^{2}(T)=8\pi\int_{T}^{T_{\rm c}}[S_{\rm en}(T^{\prime})-S_{\rm es}( T^{\prime})]dT^{\prime}.\] (24b)

In cgs units, H_{\rm c} is expressed in units of Oe, where 1 Oe^{2}=1 erg/cm^{3}, so S_{\rm en}(T^{\prime})=\gamma_{\rm av}T^{\prime} is in units of erg/cm^{3} K. The Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma_{\rm av} in units of erg/cm^{3} K^{2} is calculated from the above Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma_{\rm n} in units of mJ/mol K^{2}=10^{4} erg/mol K^{2} according to

\[\gamma_{\rm nV}=\frac{\gamma_{\rm n}}{V_{\rm M}},\] (25)

where V_{\rm M} is the molar volume in units of cm^{3}/mol. For CaPd_{2}As_{2}, our values \gamma_{\rm n}=6.52 mJ/mol K^{2} and V_{\rm M}=55.7 cm^{3}/mol from Table 1 give \gamma_{\rm av}=1170 erg/cm^{3} K^{2}. The experimental H_{\rm c}(T) data obtained from Eqs. (24) are plotted as open circles in Fig. 7(a).

In the \alpha-model, the thermodynamic critical field at T=0 is given by [46]

\[\frac{H_{\rm c}(0)}{\left(\gamma_{\rm av}T_{\rm c}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}=\sqrt{ \frac{6}{\pi}}\;\alpha\approx 1.382\,\alpha.\] (26)

Using our values of \gamma_{\rm av}, \alpha=1.58 and T_{\rm c}=1.27 K gives H_{\rm c}(0)=9.5 mT. The T dependence of H_{\rm c} is calculated

Figure 7: (Color online) (a) Thermodynamic critical field H_{\rm c} versus temperature T obtained for CaPd_{2}As_{2} from the experimentally derived electronic heat capacity C_{\rm c}(T) data using Eqs. (24) (open circles) and the theoretical prediction of the \alpha-model (Refs. [46] and [63]) using T_{\rm c}=1.27 K, \alpha=1.58 and \gamma_{\rm n}=6.52 mJ/mol K^{2} in Eqs. (26) and (27) (red curve). (b) Upper critical magnetic field H_{\rm c}(T) of CaPd_{2}As_{2} determined from the electrical resistivity \rho(T,H) (black open squares) and heat capacity C_{\rm p}(T,H) (blue open circles) data in Figs. 3(b) and 5(a), respectively. The red curve is the prediction for H_{\rm c2}(T) by the WHH theory (Ref. [67]) in Eqs. (32) for dH_{\rm c2}(T)/dT|_{T=T_{\rm c}}=-0.18 T/K, \alpha_{\rm M}=0.13 and \lambda_{\rm av}=0.

  from [46]

\[\frac{H_{\rm c}^{2}(t)}{H_{\rm c}^{2}(0)} = \frac{4\pi^{2}}{3\alpha^{2}}\int_{t}^{1}\left[\frac{S_{\rm m}(t^{ \prime})}{\gamma_{\rm\mu V}T_{\rm c}}-\frac{S_{\rm es}(t^{\prime})}{\gamma_{\rm \mu V}T_{\rm c}}\right]dt^{\prime}\] (27a) \[= \frac{4\pi^{2}}{3\alpha^{2}}\int_{t}^{1}\left[  which for H_{\rm c}(0)=9.5 mT and \kappa_{\rm GL}=11.7 gives H_{\rm c1}(0)=1.4 mT. Then, using the above values and the expression applicable to the high-\kappa_{\rm GL} limit [60]

\[\lambda_{\rm eff}^{2}=\frac{\Phi_{0}H_{\rm c2}}{4\pi\,H_{\rm c}^{2}}.\] (37)

where \Phi_{0}=2.07\times 10^{-7} G cm^{2} is the flux quantum, yields the T\to 0 effective magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{\rm eff}=530 nm in the notation of Tinkham.

The Ginzburg-Landau coherence length at T=0,\xi(0), can be estimated from [60, 65]

\[H_{\rm c2}(0)=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi(0)^{2}}.\] (38)

Using H_{\rm c2}=157 mT gives

\[\xi(0)=45.8\ {\rm nm}.\] (39)

This \xi(0) is much larger than the mean-free path \ell=1.52 nm in Eq. (14) which indicates that CaPd_{2}As_{2} is in the dirty limit.

In the dirty limit the penetration depth at T\to 0 is given by [60]

\[\lambda_{\rm eff}(0)=\lambda_{\rm L}(0)\sqrt{1+\frac{\xi_{0}}{\ell}}\qquad({ \rm dirty\ limit}).\] (40)

The T dependence of \xi is given by [60]

\[\frac{\xi(T)}{\xi_{0}}=\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{3}}\frac{H_{\rm c}(0)}{H_{\rm c}(T) \,\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)},\] (41)

yielding the relationship between the zero-temperature Ginzburg-Landau \xi(0) and the BCS \xi_{0} as

\[\frac{\xi(0)}{\xi_{0}}=\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{3}}\frac{\lambda_{\rm L}(0)}{\lambda_ {\rm eff}(0)}.\] (42)

Combining Eqs. (40) and (42) gives

\[\frac{\xi(0)}{\xi_{0}}=\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{3\left(1+\frac{\xi_{0}}{\ell}\right)} }\qquad({\rm dirty\ limit}).\] (43)

Substituting the above values for \xi(0) in Eq. (39) and \ell in Eq. (14) into Eq. (43) and solving for \xi_{0} gives \xi_{0}=1690 nm. Then, using \lambda_{\rm L}(0)=18.6 nm, \xi_{0}=1690 nm, and \ell=1.52 nm, Eq. (40) gives \lambda_{\rm eff}(0)=620 nm in the dirty limit, similar to the above estimate, which is larger than the value of 210(60) nm obtained from the penetration depth measurements in Sec. VI below.

In the absence of impurity scattering, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter at T=0 would have been \kappa_{\rm GL}=\lambda_{\rm L}^{\rm calc}(0)/\xi_{0}=18.6 nm/1690 nm \approx 0.01\ll 1/\sqrt{2} which would have been in the extreme type-I limit instead of in the type-II regime. A similar situation was found for SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}[59].

The BCS coherence length is related to the Fermi velocity within the \alpha-model by [46]

\[\xi_{0}=\frac{\hbar v_{\rm F}}{\pi\,\Delta(0)}=\left(\frac{1}{\pi\,\alpha} \right)\frac{\hbar v_{\rm F}}{k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}}.\] (44)

This allows an additional estimate of the Fermi velocity which for \alpha=1.58 and \xi_{0}=1690 nm yields v_{\rm F}=1.40\times 10^{8} cm/s. This value of v_{\rm F} is close to the value v_{\rm F}=1.20\times 10^{8} cm/s in Eq. (12) obtained from \mathcal{D}_{\rm C}(E_{\rm F}) according to Eq. (11a), indicating the self-consistency of our modeling.

A summary of the measured and derived superconducting state parameters for CaPd_{2}As_{2} is given in Table 5.

### Magnetization and magnetic susceptibility

Zero-field-cooled (ZFC) \chi(T)=M(T)/H data for a CaPd_{2}As_{2} crystal versus T in a magnetic field H=3.0 T applied along the c axis (\chi_{c}, H\parallel c) and in the ab plane (\chi_{ab}, H\perp c) are shown in Fig. 8. The data for both directions of H are strongly diamagnetic and nearly independent of T except for the Curie-like upturns at low T which were found from analysis of M(H) isotherms in the Appendix to be due to the presence of a small amount of saturable paramagnetic (PM) impurities. The intrinsic \chi(T) values at several temperatures obtained from the analysis of the M(H) isotherms are shown by filled stars in Fig. 8, which are more accurate than the \chi(T)=M(T)/H data. The \chi is anisotropic with \chi_{c}>\chi_{ab} over the entire T range.

The \chi anisotropy in CaPd_{2}As_{2} is different from the anisotropy usually observed in doped and undoped FeAs-based ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-structure compounds, where \chi_{ab}>\chi_{c} such as in BaFe_{2}As_{2}[10, 11]. The powder and temperature average of the

The value of \lambda_{\rm eff}^{\rm obs}(0) is determined from the magnetic penetration depth measurements.

  intrinsic \chi obtained from fitting the M(H) isotherm data in the Appendix over the T range 20 to 300 K is \langle\chi\rangle=[2\langle\chi_{ab}\rangle+\langle\chi_{c}\rangle]/3=-1.5 \times 10^{-4} cm^{3}/mol.

The diamagnetic susceptibilities in Fig. 8 seem to be rather large. For the purpose of comparing the diamagnetic susceptibilities of different materials, a comparison of the thermodynamic dimensionless magnetic susceptibility per unit volume \chi_{\rm V} (volume susceptibility) is most appropriate. Using the molar volume V_{\rm M}=55.7 cm^{3}/mol for CaPd_{2}As_{2} in Table 1 and \chi_{ab}(100 K) = -1.6\times 10^{-4} cm^{3}/mol from Fig. 8 (black star), one obtains \chi_{\rm V}_{\rm sub}_{\rm sub}_{\rm V}_{\rm M} in the ab plane as

\[\chi_{\rm sub}(100\ {\rm K})=-0.29\times 10^{-5}\quad({\rm CaPd_{2}As_{2}}).\] (45)

This value can be compared with the respective values for elemental Bi and C (graphite) that are well known for their exceptionally strong diamagnetism. Bi has a rhombohedral crystal structure with a mass density \rho_{\rm m}=9.8 g/cm^{3} and a gram susceptibility in the hexagonal ab plane \chi_{\rm g,ab}(100\ {\rm K})=-1.9\times 10^{-6} cm^{3}/g.^{72} The volume susceptibility \chi_{\rm V}_{\rm ph}_{\rm X}_{\rm g} is then

\[\chi_{\rm sub}(100\ {\rm K})=-1.9\times 10^{-5}\quad({\rm Bi}).\] (46)

On the other hand, using \rho_{\rm m}=2.27 g/cm^{3} for hexagonal highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and \chi_{\rm g,c}(100\ {\rm K})=-2.3\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/g.^{75} one obtains

\[\chi_{\rm v}(100\ {\rm K})=-5.2\times 10^{-5}\quad({\rm C},\ {\rm HOPG}).\] (47)

These values for Bi and graphite are about 6.5 and 18 times more diamagnetic than the value for CaPd_{2}As_{2} in Eq. (45), respectively. However, these three values are all much less diamagnetic than the value \chi_{\rm V}=-1/4\pi\approx-0.0796 for the diamagnetic susceptibility of a superconductor at low fields with zero demagnetization factor due to complete exclusion of the magnetic induction from the interior (except within a magnetic field penetration depth of the surface).

The different contributions to the intrinsic \chi are

\[\chi=\chi_{\rm core}+\chi_{\rm VV}+\chi_{\rm L}+\chi_{\rm P},\] (48)

where the first three terms are orbital susceptibilities and the last term is the Pauli spin susceptibility of the conduction carriers. \chi_{\rm core} is the isotropic diamagnetic susceptibility of localized core electrons, \chi_{\rm VV} is the generally anisotropic paramagnetic Van Vleck susceptibility, and \chi_{\rm L} is the generally isotropic Landau diamagnetic susceptibility of the conduction carriers.

The \chi_{\rm core} is estimated using atomic diamagnetic susceptibilities^{74} which gives \chi_{\rm core}=-1.78\times 10^{-4} cm^{3}/mol. The \chi_{\rm P} is related to \mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F}) by^{11,75}

\[\chi_{\rm P}=\frac{g^{2}}{4}\mu_{\rm B}^{2}\mathcal{D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F}),\] (49)

where we assume that there are no many-body enhancements to \chi_{\rm P}. Then, using g=2 and \mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F})=1.87 states/eV f.u. for both spin directions, from Table 4 we obtain \chi_{\rm P}=6.0\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol. The \chi_{\rm L} is related to \chi_{\rm P} by^{75,76}

\[\chi_{\rm L}=-\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{m_{\rm e}}{m_{\rm band}^{*}}\right)^{2} \chi_{\rm P},\] (50)

where we assume that \chi_{\rm L} is not enhanced by the electron-phonon interaction. Assuming m_{\rm band}^{*}=m_{\rm e} we obtain \chi_{\rm L}=-2.0\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol from the above value of \chi_{\rm P}. Then, \chi_{\rm VV} is obtained by subtracting these three contributions from the measured \chi according to Eq. (48). The four contributions to the intrinsic \chi are summarized in Table 6, along with corresponding values for SrPd_{2}As_{2} and BaPd_{2}As_{2} determined below.

It is seen in Table 6 that the inferred value of \chi_{\rm VV} for CaPd_{2}As_{2} is negative, which is unphysical. The reason for this error is not clear. The most likely source of the negative \chi_{\rm VV} value is a small error in correcting the total measured magnetic moment for the sample holder contribution, which was up to 40% of the total measured moment. Thus, the uncertainty in the measured \chi values is of order 10% as discussed in Sec. II. In particular, the negative \chi_{\rm VV} is about 8% of the measured moment, and an error of only 4% in the sample holder correction could cause the derived \chi_{\rm VV} to be negative.

The in-plane \rho(T) data for SrPd_{2}As_{2} measured on two different crystals #1 and #2 at different H are shown in Fig. 9. Metallic behavior is evident from the T dependence of \rho in Fig. 9(a). The expanded plot of \rho(T) in Fig. 9(b) reveals a superconducting transition at T_{\rm c}=1.5(1) K. The T_{\rm c} is suppressed with increasing H, as shown. The data in Fig. 9(b) are noisy due to the small sample size and the small voltage signal arising from the small magnitude of the resistivity at low T.

The two crystals were found to have different residual resistivities and RRR values. For crystal #1, \rho_{0}(1.8~{\rm K})=7.5~\mu\Omega cm and RRR = \rho(300~{\rm K})/\rho(1.8~{\rm K})\approx 8, whereas for crystal #2, \rho_{0}=4.9~\mu\Omega cm and RRR \approx 4. The reason the room temperature resistivities of the two crystals are different (\approx 60 and 20~\mu\Omega cm, respectively) is unknown. Since crystal #1 has the higher RRR, we analyzed the \rho(T) data of this crystal in Fig. 9(a) using the BG model. A fit of the \rho(T) data in Fig. 9(a) by Eqs. (2) for 1.8 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K gives \rho_{0}=7.57(6)~\mu\Omega cm, \rho(\Theta_{\rm R})=27.6(5)~\mu\Omega cm, and \Theta_{\rm R}=170(3) K, where we used our analytic Pade approximant [54] in place of the integral in Eq. (2a). The good fit obtained is shown by the red curve in Fig. 9(a). The value of \mathcal{R} obtained from the value of \rho(\Theta_{\rm R}) using Eq. (2b) is \mathcal{R}=29.2~\mu\Omega cm. The parameters obtained from the fit are summarized in Table 3.

### Heat capacity

The C_{\rm p}(T) data for SrPd_{2}As_{2} are shown in Fig. 10. The C_{\rm p}(T=300\,{\rm K})\approx 124~J/mol K is close to the classical Dulong-Petit high-TC_{\rm p}=5R=124.7~J/mol K. In order to correlate low-TC_{\rm p}(T) data with \rho(T) data obtained on the same crystal, we also measured the low-TC_{\rm p}(T) on a different crystal #2 as shown in Fig. 11(a), for which the \rho(T) data are shown in Fig. 9(b). As shown in the inset of Fig. 10, a rather sharp heat capacity jump is observed at T_{\rm c}=0.92(5) K due to the superconducting transition, where we define T_{\rm c} to be the transition midpoint. Two important differences are observed between the C_{\rm p}(T) and \rho(T) data on crystal #2. First, the T_{\rm c} obtained from the two measurements are different: T_{\rm c}=0.92(5) K from C_{\rm p}(T) and T_{\rm c}=1.5(1) K from \rho(T). Second, while the superconductivity is suppressed to a temperature below 0.45 K by H=0.05 T in C_{\rm p}(T), superconductivity occurs at \approx1 K even at H=0.15 T in \rho(T).

Figure 10: (Color online) The heat capacity C_{\rm p} of a SrPd_{2}As_{2} single crystal versus temperature T measured in zero magnetic field H. The red curve is the fitted sum of the contributions from the Debye lattice heat capacity C_{\rm V Debye}(T) and predetermined electronic heat capacity \gamma_{n}T according to Eq. (5a). Inset: Expanded plot of C_{p}/T versus T for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 2.0 K measured on a different crystal (crystal #2 of Fig. 9) at field H=0. The vertical dotted red line indicates the T_{\rm c}.

Figure 9: (Color online) (a) In-plane electrical resistivity \rho of a SrPd_{2}As_{2} crystal (crystal #1) versus temperature T measured in applied magnetic field H=0. The red curve is a fit by the Bloch-Grüneisen model in Eqs. (2). (b) Expanded plot of the low-T\rho(T) data for SrPd_{2}As_{2} crystal #2 for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4 K showing the superconducting transition for different H applied along the c axis. The noise in the data is due to the small size of the crystal and the small magnitude of \rho at low temperatures.

 These two observations suggest the presence of filamentary superconductivity in SrPd_{2}As_{2} which is probed by \rho(T) at temperatures above the bulk T_{\rm c} whereas C_{\rm p}(T) measures the bulk superconductivity.

A fit of the normal-state C_{\rm p}(T)/T versus T^{2} data using the H=0.1 T data for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4.4 K and the H=0 data for 1.3 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4.4 K in Fig. 11(b) by Eq. (3) (the fitted data from 3.2 to 4.4 K are not shown) gives \gamma_{\rm h}=6.43(3) mJ/mol K^{2}, \beta=0.369(8) mJ/mol K^{4}, and \delta=3.7(5)\muJ/mol K^{6} as shown by the red curve. The Debye temperature estimated from \beta using Eq. (4) is \Theta_{\rm D}=298(3) K. A fit of C_{\rm p}(T) in Fig. 10 over the entire T range (2-300 K) by Eqs. (5) with \gamma_{\rm h} fixed to the above value and using the Pade approximant [54] in place of the Debye function gives \Theta_{\rm D}=245(3) K. The fit is shown by the red curve in Fig. 10. The value of \Theta_{\rm D} is smaller than the value of 298(3) K obtained from the low-T fit, indicating a T-dependent \Theta_{\rm D}. [54] The parameters obtained from the analyses of the normal-state C_{\rm p}(T) data are summarized in Table 4.

The electron-phonon coupling constant is estimated from Eq. (9) as \lambda_{\rm el.ph}=0.443 using \mu^{*}=0.13, T_{\rm c}=0.92 K, and \Theta_{\rm D}=298 K. Then we estimate \mathcal{D}_{C}(E_{\rm F})=2.73(2) states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions from Eq. (6) and \mathcal{D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})=1.89(1) states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions from Eq. (8a), which is very close to that of CaPd_{2}As_{2} in Table 4. The Fermi velocity obtained from Eq. (11a) is v_{\rm F}=1.17\times 10^{8} cm/s, and the mean-free path for this value of v_{\rm F} and \rho_{0}=4.9\mu\Omega cm using Eq. (13) is \ell=11.6 nm. The \omega_{\rm p} and \lambda_{\rm L}(0) estimated from Eqs. (16) and (18), respectively, are listed in Table 7.

The electronic contribution C_{\rm e}(T) to the measured low-TC_{\rm p}(T) of SrPd_{2}As_{2}, obtained by subtracting \beta T^{3}+\delta T^{5} from C_{\rm p}(T) according to Eq. (3), is plotted versus T in Fig. 12(a), and C_{\rm e}(T)/T is plotted versus T in Fig. 12(b). Utilizing the entropy-conserving construction in Fig. 12(b) we obtain \Delta C_{\rm e}(T_{\rm c})/T_{\rm c}=5.0(2) mJ/mol K^{2},

Figure 11: (Color online) (a) Heat capacity C_{\rm p} versus temperature T of a SrPd_{2}As_{2} single crystal (crystal #2 of Fig. 9) for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 2.0 K measured at the indicated values of applied magnetic field H with H\parallel c. (b) C_{\rm p}/T vs T^{2} for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 3.2 K with H=0 and 0.1 T. The red curve is a fit of the H=0.1 T data for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4.4 K and the H=0 data for 1.3 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4.4 K by Eq. (3) (the fitted data from 3.2 to 4.4 K are not shown).

  \Delta C_{\rm e}(T_{\rm c})=4.6(2){\rm mJ/mol}{\rm K} using T_{\rm c}=0.92(5){\rm K}, and \Delta C_{\rm e}(T_{\rm c})/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c}=0.77(5) using \gamma_{\rm h}=6.43(3){\rm mJ/mol}{\rm K}^{2}. The value of \Delta C_{\rm e}(T_{\rm c})/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c} is significantly smaller than the BCS weak-coupling value of 1.43, as was also the case for CaPd_{2}As_{2} discussed above, and from Eq. (21) we obtain \alpha=1.30(4) which may be compared with the BCS value of 1.764. In Figs. 12(a) and 12(b) we show as the red curves the respective theoretical predictions of the \alpha-model obtained using \alpha=1.30 in Eqs. (23). Also shown as the dashed blue curve in Fig. 12(b) is the theoretical prediction for \alpha=1.50, which is the value that best fits the H_{\rm c}(T) data in Fig. 13(a) below.

The H_{\rm c}(T) for SrPd_{2}As_{2} is obtained by integrating the C_{\rm e}(T) data in Fig. 12 according to Eqs. (24) and the results are shown in Fig. 13(a). The shoulder just above T_{\rm c} arises from the high-T shoulder in the C_{\rm e}(T) data in Figs. 12(a) and 12(b). The value of H_{\rm c}(0) is calculated from Eq. (26) using \alpha=1.30, \gamma_{\rm h}=6.43{\rm mJ/mol}{\rm K}^{2}, and T_{\rm c}=0.92{\rm K}, yielding H_{\rm c}(0)=5.5 mT. The theoretical prediction of the \alpha-model in Eqs. (27) for H_{\rm c}(T) using these parameters is plotted in Fig. 13(a). Although the T dependence of the data is reproduced, the calculated magnitude does not agree with the data. A better fit as shown in Fig. 13(a) by the blue dashed curve is obtained using \alpha=1.50, for which H_{\rm c}(0) is calculated as above to be 6.3 mT.

The H_{\rm c2} versus T data obtained from the above C_{\rm p}(T) and   As already mentioned the two measurements show different T_{\rm c}'s in zero field. Consistent with this difference, the H_{\rm c2}(T) behavior derived from the \rho(T) data indicates that the upper critical field of the filamentary superconductivity is larger than the bulk H_{\rm c2}. The above values of H_{\rm c}(0) for both \alpha=1.30 or 1.50 are much smaller than the bulk H_{\rm c2}(0) extrapolated from the heat capacity data in Fig. 13(b), indicating type-II superconductivity in SrPd_{2}As_{2} as was also found above to be the case in CaPd_{2}As_{2}.

From the C_{\rm p}(T) data in Fig. 13(b) one obtains dH_{\rm c2}(T)/dT|_{T=T,\,\,=-0.12(4)} T/K. Equation (28) then gives H_{\rm c2}^{\rm Orb}(0)=0.077 T in the clean limit and H_{\rm c2}^{\rm Orb}(0)=0.073 T in the dirty limit. Using \alpha=1.30, the Pauli-limiting field is obtained from Eq. (30) as H_{\rm P}(0)=1.37 T and the Maki parameter in Eq. (31) is then \alpha_{\rm M}=0.08. An estimate of H_{\rm c2}(T) obtained from the WHH prediction in Eqs. (32) using \alpha_{\rm M}=0.08 and \lambda_{\rm so}=0 is shown as the solid red curve in Fig. 13(b), from which we obtain H_{\rm c2}(0)=70 mT.

The Ginzburg-Landau parameter is obtained from Eq. (35) using H_{\rm c2}(0)=70 mT and H_{\rm c}(0)=5.5 mT, yielding \kappa_{\rm GL}=9.0. The lower critical field estimated from Eq. (36) is H_{\rm c1}(0)=0.94 mT. The Ginzburg-Landau coherence length at T=0 obtained from Eq. (38) is \xi(0)=69 nm which together with \ell=11.6 nm and Eq. (41) for the dirty limit gives \xi_{0}=509 nm. The Fermi velocity estimated from \xi_{0} using Eq. (44) is v_{\rm F}=0.25\times 10^{8} cm/s for \alpha=1.30 which is of the same order as the above estimated value of v_{\rm F} from the density of states. Corresponding values of the above parameters for \alpha=1.50 were also calculated. A summary of the measured and derived superconducting parameters for SrPd_{2}As_{2} is given in Table 7.

### Magnetization and magnetic susceptibility

The ZFC \chi(T)\equiv M(T)/H data for a SrPd_{2}As_{2} single crystal measured in H=3.0 T are shown in Fig. 14 together with the intrinsic \chi obtained from fitting M(H) isotherm data for H\geqslant 2 T in the Appendix by Eq. (10). These two data sets are in excellent agreement over the whole T range, indicating the near absence of ferromagnetic and saturable paramagnetic impurities in the crystal. The very small upturns below \sim10 K in \chi(T) in Fig. 14 are attributed to a trace amount of paramagnetic impurities. The \chi is diamagnetic and exhibits a weak T dependence with a strong anisotropy \chi_{ab}>\chi_{c}. The large anisotropy in \chi most likely originates from anisotropy in the paramagnetic Van Vleck orbital contribution \chi_{\rm VV} in Eq. (48), although the strong temperature dependence of the anisotropy is unusual and unexpected for such a compound and for which the origin is not clear. Despite having the same crystal structure, the \chi anisotropy in SrPd_{2}As_{2} is opposite to that of CaPd_{2}As_{2} in Fig. 8 for which we observed \chi_{ab}<\chi_{c}. This difference in the sign of the anisotropy between the two compounds is evidently again attributable to a difference in the sign of the anisotropy in the Van Vleck contributions between the two compounds.

The powder and temperature (1.8-300 K) average of the intrinsic \chi obtained from the M(H) isotherms in the Appendix is \langle\chi\rangle=-3.9\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol. The diamagnetic core susceptibility estimated using the atomic diamagnetic susceptibilities [74] is \chi_{\rm core}=-1.93\times 10^{-4} cm^{3}/mol. The Pauli susceptibility estimated from Eq. (49) using \mathcal{D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})=1.89 states/eV f.u. for both spin directions is \chi_{\rm P}=6.1\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol. The \chi_{\rm L}=-2.0\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol was obtained by taking m_{\rm band}^{*}=m_{\rm e} in Eq. (50). Then \langle\chi_{\rm VV}\rangle is obtained from these values using Eq. (48). The various \chi contributions are summarized in Table 6.

VI Magnetic penetration depth measurements of CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2}

Figure 15 shows the temperature variation of the ab-plane magnetic penetration depth \Delta\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)\equiv\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)-\lambda_{\rm eff}(0) measured in CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2} crystals, represented by open circles and triangles, respectively. The absolute value of the penetration depth was obtained using the TDR technique by matching the frequency shift \Delta f(T) to the skin depth \delta calculated from the resistivity. The superconducting transition temperature was determined as the temperature of the maximum of d\Delta\lambda_{\rm eff}/dT. The determined T_{\rm c}'s are 1.34 and 1.26 K for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2}, respectively. These values are higher than the bulk T_{\rm c}'s of 1.27(3) and 0.92(5) K determined from respective C_{\rm p}(T) data (Tables 5 and 71, respectively). Even so, the actual onset of the diamagnetic response is observed at even higher temperatures T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset}=1.50 and 1.72 K for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2}, respectively. The T dependencies of \Delta\lambda_{\rm eff} for the two compounds up to T_{\rm c} are shown in the inset of Fig. 15.

At low temperatures, the \Delta\lambda_{\rm eff}(T) in Fig. 15 of each sample shows a clear saturation on cooling, which is an indication of a fully gapped superconducting order parameter in both compounds. Our compounds are dirty-limit superconductors, for which the magnetic penetration depth in the single-band

The filled stars represent the intrinsic \chi obtained in the Appendix from fitting M(H) isotherm data by Eq. (10). The lines joining the stars are guides to the eye.

  model for T/T_{\rm c}\ll 1 in Tinkham's notation [60] is

\[\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)=\lambda_{\rm L}(T)\sqrt{1+\frac{k_{0}}{\ell}},\] (51a) where \[\lambda_{\rm L}(T)\] is the clean-limit BCS London penetration depth prediction, yielding the \[T=0\] expression in Eq. ( 40 ), and also for \[T/T_{\rm c}\ll 1\] the expression \[\frac{\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)}{\lambda_{\rm eff}(0)}=\frac{\lambda_{\rm L}(T)}{ \lambda_{\rm L}(0)}.\] (51b) Defining \[\Delta\lambda(T)=\lambda(T)-\lambda(0)\] , one obtains \[\frac{\Delta\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)}{\lambda_{\rm eff}(0)}=\frac{\Delta\lambda_{ \rm L}(T)}{\lambda_{\rm L}(0)}.\] (51c)

The right-hand side of this equation is just the clean-limit BCS prediction for local electrodynamics given by [46, 62, 64]

\[\frac{\Delta\lambda_{\rm L}(T)}{\lambda_{\rm L}(0)}=\sqrt{\frac{\pi\,\Delta(0 )}{2k_{\rm B}T}}\,\exp\left[-\frac{\Delta(0)}{k_{\rm B}T}\right].\] (52)

Combining Eqs. (51c) and (52) gives

\[\Delta\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)=\lambda_{\rm eff}(0)\sqrt{\frac{\pi\,\Delta(0)}{2k _{\rm B}T}}\,\exp\left[-\frac{\Delta(0)}{k_{\rm B}T}\right].\] (53)

The experimental data are fitted well up to T\approx T_{\rm c}/3 by Eq. (53) as shown by the solid curves in Fig. 15, where the fitting parameters are \lambda_{\rm eff}(0)=210\pm 60 nm and \Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}=2.02\pm 0.14 K for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and \lambda_{\rm eff}(0)=170\pm 70 nm and \Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}=2.05\pm 0.20 K for SrPd_{2}As_{2}. The listed errors are systematic errors obtained from the spread of the fitting parameters depending on different choices of the upper temperature limit near T_{\rm c}/3.

Using the bulk T_{\rm c} values in Tables 5 and 7 and the above values of \Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}, we obtain \alpha=1.59(14) for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and \alpha=2.23(0.32) for SrPd_{2}As_{2}. The value of \alpha for CaPd_{2}As_{2} is identical within the error bars to the value of 1.58(2) in Eq. (22) that was determined from the heat capacity jump, both of which are smaller than the value \alpha_{\rm BCS}\approx 1.764 expected for an isotropic weak-coupling BCS superconductor [46, 62]. This reduction is most likely due to a moderate anisotropy of the order parameter [46] rather than multiple order parameters because well-known multigap superconductors such as MgB_{2}[77], NbSe_{2}[78], and LiFeAs (Ref. [79]) have shown much lower values of \alpha for the smaller gap. The accuracy of \alpha for SrPd_{2}As_{2} is uncertain because of the significantly larger superconducting transition width obtained from the heat capacity measurements for this compound, and will therefore not be further considered.

The above parameter values obtained for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2} are listed in Tables 5 and 7, respectively.

## VII Physical properties of BaPd_{2}As_{2} crystals

### Electrical resistivity

The in-plane \rho(T) data for a BaPd_{2}As_{2} crystal are shown in Fig. 16. The T dependence of \rho reveals metallic behavior with a very small residual resistivity \rho_{0}\approx 1\mu\Omega cm and a large RRR \approx 25, demonstrating the high quality of the crystal. The scale of the resistivity for BaPd_{2}As_{2} is smaller and the RRR is much larger than those of CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2}. The \rho(T) data were fitted by Eqs. (2) for 2 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K using the analytic Pade approximant function [54] as shown by red curve in Fig. 16. The excellent fit obtained yielded the fitting parameters \rho_{0}=1.02(1)\mu\Omega cm, \rho(\Theta_{\rm R})=8.84(1)\mu\Omega cm, and \Theta_{\rm R}=114(1) K. The value of the constant {\cal R} obtained

Figure 16: (Color online) In-plane electrical resistivity \rho of a BaPd_{2}As_{2} crystal versus temperature T measured in zero magnetic field H. The red curve is a fit by the Bloch-Grüneisen model. Inset: Expanded plot of the low-T\rho(T) data showing the onset of superconductivity at T\lesssim 2.0 K measured at H=0 and 0.05 T applied along the c axis. We infer that this superconductivity is filamentary and not bulk.

Figure 15: (Color online) The change \Delta\lambda_{\rm eff}=\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)-\lambda_{\rm eff}(T\to 0) of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{\rm eff} measured in CaPd_{2}As_{2} (filled circles) and SrPd_{2}As_{2} (filled triangles). The data for SrPd_{2}As_{2} are shifted vertically upwards by 30 nm for clarity. The solid curve for each compound is the best fit of the data by the prediction in Eq. (52) for a single-gap s-wave BCS superconductor for T\lesssim T_{\rm c}/3. The vertical dashed line is the upper temperature limit for the fits. Inset: \Delta\lambda_{\rm eff}(T) for both compounds up to T=T_{\rm c}. The data for SrPd_{2}As_{2} are all shifted upwards by 2\mum for clarity.

  using Eq. (2d) is {\cal R}=9.34\mu\Omega cm. The fit parameters are summarized in Table 3.

The expanded low-T plot of \rho(T) in the inset of Fig. 16 reveals an onset of superconductivity at T_{\rm c\,onset}\approx 2.0 K for H=0 with zero resistance at about 0.6 K. However, the transition width is very large compared to those of CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2}, and the heat capacity measurements in the following section show no evidence for superconductivity above 0.45 K. An applied field of 0.05 T decreases T_{\rm c\,onset} by \approx 0.8 K, as shown.

### Heat capacity

The C_{\rm p}(T) data for BaPd_{2}As_{2} are shown in Fig. 17. Like the other two compounds, the C_{\rm p}(T=300 K) = 124 J/mol K is close to the expected high-T classical Dulong-Petit value. An expanded low-T plot of C_{\rm p}/T versus T^{2} is shown in the inset of Fig. 17. A fit of the data with 0.45 K \leq T\leq 5 K by Eq. (3) yields \gamma_{\rm n}=4.79(2) mJ/mol K^{2}, \beta=0.638(5) mJ/mol K^{4}, and \delta=4.0(3)\muJ/mol K^{6}, as shown by the red curve in the inset. A {\cal D}_{\rm c}(E_{\rm F})=2.03(1) states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions is estimated from \gamma_{\rm n} using Eq. (6). The value \Theta_{\rm D}=248(1) K is obtained from \beta using Eq. (4).

A value \Theta_{\rm D}=227(2) K is obtained by fitting the C_{\rm p}(T) data by Eqs. (5) over the entire T range (2-300 K), as shown by the red curve in Fig. 17. Here again we used the analytic Pade approximant function [54] for C_{\rm V\,Debye}(T) and set \gamma_{\rm n} to the fixed value obtained above from the fit to the low-TC_{\rm p}(T) data. The normal-state parameters obtained from these fits are summarized in Table 4.

In contrast to the observation of the onset of superconductivity in the \rho(T) data at \approx 2.0 K in the inset of Fig. 16, no corresponding feature is observed in the bulk C_{\rm p}(T) data above 0.45 K in the inset of Fig. 17, which indicates that there is no bulk superconductivity in BaPd_{2}As_{2} and hence the superconductivity detected by the \rho(T) measurements is filamentary in nature.

### Magnetization and magnetic susceptibility

The anisotropic \chi(T)\equiv M(T)/H data of a BaPd_{2}As_{2} single crystal in H=3.0 T are shown in Fig. 18. The \chi is diamagnetic over the whole T range and exhibits a weak T dependence. We find that \chi_{c}>\chi_{ab}, which has the same sign of the \chi anisotropy as in CaPd_{2}As_{2} but is opposite to that of SrPd_{2}As_{2}. One must keep in mind in making these comparisons that the crystal structure of BaPd_{2}As_{2} is different from that of CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2}. The intrinsic anisotropic susceptibilities obtained from the slopes of high-field linear fits to the M(H) isotherms in the Appendix are shown by solid stars in Fig. 18. These data are in rather good agreement with the \chi(T)\equiv M(T)/H data in Fig. 18 above 25 K, and indicate that the low-T upturns below 25 K are due to a small amount of paramagnetic impurities.

The different contributions to the intrinsic \chi of BaPd_{2}As_{2} were estimated following the same approach as for the Ca and Sr members above. The powder and temperature average of the intrinsic \chi obtained from the analyses of the M(H) isotherms from 1.8 to 300 K in the Appendix is \langle\chi\rangle=-1.24\times 10^{-4} cm^{3}/mol. We also obtain \chi_{\rm core}=-2.16\times 10^{-4} cm^{3}/mol, \chi_{\rm P}=6.3\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol assuming {\cal D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})={\cal D}_{\rm c}(E_{\rm F}), and \chi_{\rm L}=-2.2\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol [using m_{\rm band}^{*}=m_{\rm e} in Eq. (50)]. A value \langle\chi_{\rm V\rm V}\rangle=4.8\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol is then obtained using Eq. (48). These contributions are summarized in Table 6.

## VIII Summary and conclusions

The crystallographic, electronic transport, thermal, magnetic and superconducting properties of _A_Pd_{2}As_{2} (_A_ = Ca, Sr, Ba) single crystals were investigated. The magnetic measurements in the normal state reveal anisotropic diamagnetism with \chi_{c}>\chi_{ab} for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and BaPd_{2}As_{2}, and \chi_{ab}>\chi_{c} for SrPd_{2}As_{2}. The \chi(T), \rho(T), and C_{\rm p}(T) data indicate sp-band-like metallic behavior of all three compounds and provide conclusive evidence for bulk superconductivity in CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2} but only filamentary superconductivity in BaPd_{2}As_{2} which has a different crystal structure. The superconducting transition temperatures as estimated from the zero-field C_{\rm p}(T) data are T_{\rm c}=1.27(3) K for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and T_{\rm c}=0.92(5) K for SrPd_{2}As_{2}. The heat capacity jump at T_{\rm c}, \Delta C_{\rm c}(T_{\rm c}), of CaPd_{2}As_{2} in H = 0 is extremely sharp, which allows unambiguous analysis of the derived electronic contribution C_{\rm c}(T) in the superconducting state. The \Delta C_{\rm c}(T_{\rm c})/\gamma_{\rm s}T_{\rm c}=1.14(3) is significantly smaller than the BCS prediction of 1.43. We analyzed the C_{\rm e}(T) data in the superconducting state using the \alpha-model,[46, 63] where \alpha=\Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}. A good fit to the data was obtained using \alpha=1.58, which is significantly smaller than the BCS value of 1.764 which we surmise is due to anisotropy in the superconducting s-wave gap. The thermodynamic critical field H_{\rm c}(T) is also in agreement with the \alpha-model prediction using the same value of \alpha.

While the \rho(T) data of CaPd_{2}As_{2} exhibit a T_{\rm c} consistent with that obtained from the C_{\rm p}(T) data, the \rho(T) data of SrPd_{2}As_{2} exhibit a higher T_{\rm c} evidently due to filamentary nonbulk superconductivity. Our analysis of the normal and superconducting states \rho(T,H) and C_{\rm p}(T,H) data of these two compounds and estimated superconducting parameters indicate type-II superconductivity with small thermodynamic critical fields and upper critical fields that are much smaller than those of the doped FeAs-based superconductors.

_Note added_. Recently, an electronic structure study of (Ca,Sr,Ba)Pd_{2}As_{2} appeared which largely substantiates our analyses of our experimental data for these compounds and offers additional perspectives.[80]

## Appendix: Presentation and analysis of _M_(_h_) isotherms

### CaPd_{2}As_{2}

The M(H) isotherms for a CaPd_{2}As_{2} crystal measured at eight temperatures between 1.8 and 300 K for H applied both along the c axis (M_{c}, H \parallel c) and in the _ab_ plane (M_{ab}, H \perp c) are shown in Fig. 19. Consistent with the \chi, the M is diamagnetic (negative) and exhibits weak anisotropy with M_{c}(H)>M_{ab}(H). For T\geqslant 50 K, the M(H) curves are almost linear in H, however, at low T a slight nonlinearity is observed that can be attributed to the presence of a small amount of saturable paramagnetic (PM) impurities. Further, the presence of trace amount of ferromagnetic (FM) impurities is also inferred from the M(H) curves.

We estimated the FM impurity contribution by fitting the M(H) data for T\geqslant 50 K and H\geqslant 2 T by

\[M(H)=M_{\rm s}+\chi\,H,\] (10)

where M_{\rm s} is the FM impurity saturation magnetization. For T\geqslant 50 K the M_{\rm s} is found to be almost T independent and anisotropic with values for H\parallel c and H\perp c listed in Table 8. The M_{\rm s} value of 0.48 G cm^{3}/mol for H\parallel c is equivalent to the saturation magnetization of 39 molar ppm of Fe metal impurities suggesting that only trace amounts of FM impurities are present in the crystal. However, due to the small magnitude of the diamagnetic \chi even trace amounts of FM impurities are observable in \chi and M measurements.

Figure 19: (Color online) Isothermal magnetization M of CaPd_{2}As_{2} versus applied magnetic field H at different temperatures, as listed, for magnetic fields applied (a) in the _ab_ plane (H\perp c) and (b) along the c axis (H\parallel c). The solid curves are fits of the M(H) data by Eqs. (11) for 1.0\leqslant H\leqslant 5.5 T.

 Once the FM impurity contributions M_{\rm s} to the magnetizations were determined, we analyzed the low-TM(H) data for both field directions by

\[M(T,H)=M_{\rm s}+\chi\,H+f_{\rm imp}M_{\rm swap}\,B_{\rm S_{\rm sup}}(x).\] (2a) Here, \[\chi is the intrinsic susceptibility of the compound, \[f_{\rm imp}\] is the molar fraction of PM impurities, \[M_{\rm swap}=N_{\rm A}S_{\rm imp}\mu_{\rm B}S_{\rm imp}\] is the PM impurity saturation magnetization, \[N_{\rm A}\] is Avogadro's number, \[\mu_{\rm B}\] is the Bohr magneton, and \[g_{\rm imp}\] and \[S_{\rm imp}\] are the spectroscopic splitting factor (\[g\] factor) and the spin of the impurities, respectively. Our unconventional definition of the Brillouin function \[B_{S_{\rm sup}}\] is [11 ] \[B_{S_{\rm sup}}(x) = \frac{1}{2S_{\rm imp}}\left\{(2S_{\rm imp}+1)\coth\left[(2S_{\rm imp }+1)\frac{x}{2}\right]\right.\] (2b) \[- \left.\coth\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\right\},\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}  & Field & M_{\rm s} & \chi & f_{\rm imp} \\ Compound & direction & \frac{(\rm{S}\,{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{ \rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{ \rm{ }}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}})}} & (10^{-5}\,{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\{\rm{\it{\rm{\it{\rm{\rm{ \it{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{ }}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}

  where

\[x\equiv\frac{g_{\rm imp}\mu_{\rm B}H}{k_{\rm B}(T-\theta_{\rm imp})}.\] (20)

A Weiss temperature \theta_{\rm imp} is included in the argument of B_{S_{\rm imp}}(x) to take into account for interactions between the paramagnetic impurities in an average mean-field way.

While fitting the M(H) data the impurity g factor was set to g_{\rm imp}=2 and the M_{\rm s} values for H\perp c and H\parallel c were set to the values listed in Table 8. The M(H) data for both H directions were fitted for magnetic fields in the range 1.0\leqslant H\leqslant 5.5 T. The S_{\rm imp} values for both H directions were found to be S_{\rm imp}=2.0(2); therefore, in the final fits we set S_{\rm imp}=2. The \theta_{\rm imp} values for both field directions were found to be close to zero and therefore in the final fits we set \theta_{\rm imp}\equiv 0. The solid curves in Fig. 19 show the final fits of the M(H) data by Eqs. (21). The parameters obtained from the fits of the M(H) isotherms at T=1.8 K are listed in Table 8. The intrinsic \chi values obtained from the fits of the M(H) data at different temperatures are shown by stars in Fig. 8. The T dependence of the intrinsic \chi values clearly indicates that the low-T upturns in the measured \chi(T)\equiv M(T)/H data are extrinsic.

## 2 SrPd_{2}As_{2}

The isothermal M(H) data for a SrPd_{2}As_{2} crystal at different T are shown in Fig. 20. Similar to the \chi(T)\equiv M(T)/H data in Fig. 14, the M(H) data exhibit anisotropic diamagnetic behavior with M_{ab}(H)>M_{c}(H). In order to obtain the contributions from the FM impurities, the M(H) data for H\geqslant 2 T at T\geqslant 1.8 K were fitted by Eq. (21) which gave the average M_{\rm s} values of 0.002(4) for H\perp c and 0.02(1) for H\parallel c. The fitting parameters for both H\parallel c and H\perp c for T=1.8 K are listed in Table 8. The intrinsic susceptibilities obtained from the analysis of M(H) data by Eq. (21) are shown by stars in Fig. 14. The paramagnetic impurity concentration is zero within our resolution since no curvature in the M(H) curves on cooling to low T in addition to that due to the FM impurities was detected.

## 3 BaPd_{2}As_{2}

The M(H) isotherms for a BaPd_{2}As_{2} crystal at different T are shown in Fig. 21. The M(H) curves exhibit weakly anisotropic diamagnetic behavior with M_{c}(H)>M_{ab}(H). The intrinsic \chi was obtained by fitting the M(H) isotherms at each T by Eq. (21) for H\geqslant 2 T which yielded temperature-averaged (for T\geqslant 50 K) FM saturation values M_{\rm s}^{ab}=0.18(3) G cm^{2}/mol and M_{\rm s}^{c}=0.20(4) G cm^{2}/mol which are equivalent to the magnetization contributions from 12 and 16 molar ppm of Fe metal impurities, respectively. As in the Sr compound, the paramagnetic impurity concentration is zero within our resolution since no curvature in the M(H) curves on cooling to low T in addition to that due to the FM impurities was detected.

###### Abstract

The synthesis and crystallography, magnetic susceptibility _kh_, magnetization M, specific heat _C_p, in-plane electrical resistivity _ρ_, and in-plane magnetic penetration depth measurements are reported for single crystals of \mathbf{APd_{2}As_{2}} (_A_ = Ca, Sr, Ba) versus temperature T and magnetic field H. The crystals were grown using PdAs self-flux. CaPd2As2 and SrPd2As2 crystallize in a collapsed body-centered tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type structure (I4/mmm), whereas BaPd2As2 crystallizes in the primitive tetragonal CeMg2Si2-type structure (P4/mmm), in agreement with literature data. The _ρ_(_T_) data exhibit metallic behavior for all three compounds. Bulk superconductivity is reported for CaPd2As2 and SrPd2As2 below _T_c = 1.27 and 0.92 K, respectively, whereas only a trace of superconductivity is found in BaPd2As2. No other phase transitions were observed. The _kh_(_T_) and _M_(_H_) data reveal anisotropic diamagnetism in the normal state, with _khc_ > _khd_ for CaPd2As2 and BaPd2As2, and _khc_ < _khd_ for SrPd2As2. The normal and superconducting state data indicate that CaPd2As2 and SrPd2As2 are conventional type-II nodeless _s_-wave electron-phonon superconductors. The electronic superconducting state heat capacity data for CaPd2As2, which has an extremely sharp heat capacity jump at _T_c, are analyzed using our recent elaboration of the _a_-model of the BCS theory of superconductivity, which indicates that the _s_-wave gap in this compound is anisotropic in momentum space.

## I Introduction

The observation of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) with transition temperatures _T_c \lesssim 38 K in doped 122-type iron arsenides such as in A_{1-x}K_{x}Fe2As2 (_A_ = Ba, Sr, Ca, and Eu) compounds has stimulated great interest in these materials.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] The parent compounds _A_Fe2As2 with A = Ca, Sr, and Ba are itinerant antiferromagnetic (AF) semimetals that undergo a structural distortion from a tetragonal structure to an orthorhombic one on cooling below room temperature. On cooling, the structural transition is concident with or precedes a long-range AF itinerant spin density wave (SDW) transition. Superconductivity in these compounds emerges upon suppression of the SDW transition that can be achieved either by partial chemical substitutions at either the A, Fe, or As sites or by application of external pressure.[11] The same phenomenology is found in the high-_T_c cuprates where the long-range AF order must be largely suppressed by doping prior to the emergence of superconductivity, but strong dynamic AF spin fluctuations must still be present. Thus, the iron arsenides and the high-_T_c cuprates have a similar generic phase diagram for the emergence of superconductivity, even though the cuprate parent compounds are AF insulators rather than SDW semimetals.[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]

The partial substitutions at the Fe-site in \mathit{AE}_{\text{2}}As2 by transition metals M in Ba(Fe1-_x_M_x)2As2 with M = Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, and Pd have recently been studied both theoretically and experimentally from the perspective of the degree of charge doping because of the changes in the magnetic and SC properties caused by such substitutions.[6, 12, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 6  atoms in CaPd_{2}As_{2} form a body-centered tetragonal sublattice, in the BaPd_{2}As_{2} structure the Ba atoms form a primitive tetragonal sublattice. Furthermore, the fourfold coordination of Pdy As is tetrahedral in CaPd_{2}As_{2} but is planar rectangular in BaPd_{2}As_{2}. The BaPd_{2}As_{2} structure can be derived from that of CaPd_{2}As_{2} by a [\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0] translation of the central As-Ca-As layer. Superconductivity was recently reported below T_{\rm c}=3.0 K in the similar compound SrPd_{2}Ge_{2} with the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure.[45]

In this paper we report crystallographic investigations of crushed single crystal powders and physical property measurements of single crystals of the three (Ca,Sr,Ba)Pd_{2}As_{2} compounds using magnetic susceptibility \chi, isothermal magnetization M, specific heat C_{\rm p}, ab-plane electrical resistivity \rho and magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{\rm eff} measurements as a function of temperature T and applied magnetic field H. The published structures of these compounds are confirmed. The \rho(T), \chi(T), and C_{\rm p}(T) data demonstrate that all three compounds are sp-band-like metals. The \chi(T) data indicate anisotropic diamagnetic behavior in all three compounds with \chi_{c}>\chi_{ab} for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and BaPd_{2}As_{2} and \chi_{c}<\chi_{ab} for SrPd_{2}As_{2}. Bulk superconducting transitions at T_{\rm c}=1.27(3) K for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and T_{\rm c}=0.92(5) K for SrPd_{2}As_{2} are also reported together with other superconducting state properties derived from the above measurements. We analyzed the superconducting state electronic entropy and heat capacity data using our recent elaboration of the \alpha-model of the BCS theory of superconductivity.[46] The data indicate that CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2} are both conventional nodeless type-II electron-phonon superconductors, but with anisotropic s-wave gaps. Filamentary superconductivity was also detected below 2.0 K in BaPd_{2}As_{2}.

The experimental details are described in Sec. II. The crystallographic studies of CaPd_{2}As_{2}, SrPd_{2}As_{2}, and BaPd_{2}As_{2} are presented in Sec. III. The superconducting and normal-state properties of CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2} are given in Secs. IV and V, respectively, and the measurements of their superconducting magnetic penetration depths versus temperature are presented in Sec. VI. The normal-state properties of BaPd_{2}As_{2} are presented in Sec. VII. A summary of the experimental results and analyses and the conclusions is given in Sec. VIII.

## II Experimental Details

Single crystals of APd_{2}As_{2} (A= Ba, Ca, Sr) were grown using PdAs flux. The starting materials were high-purity elemental Ca (99.98%), Pd (99.998%), and As (99.9999%) from Alfa Aesar and Sr (99.95%) and Ba (99.99%) from Sigma Aldrich. The Ca, Sr, or Ba and prereacted PdAs flux taken in a 1:4 molar ratio were placed in alumina crucibles and sealed inside evacuated fused silica tubes. The sealed samples were heated to 1100 degC at a rate of 60-80 degC/h and held there for 12 h. After cooling at a rate of 2.5 degC/h to 800 degC, shiny platelike crystals of typical size 2\times 1.5\times 0.4 mm^{3} were separated by decanting the flux with a centrifuge at that temperature.

The phase purity and the chemical composition of the CaPd_{2}As_{2}, SrPd_{2}As_{2}, and BaPd_{2}As_{2} crystals were measured using a JEOL scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive x-ray analyzer (EDX). High-resolution SEM images demonstrated that the crystals were single phase. The EDX analyses of two or three single crystals of each compound were consistent with the ideal 1 : 2 : 2 stoichiometry. The crystal structures of the samples were determined by Rietveld refinements of powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) data for crushed single crystals collected on a Rigaku Geigerflex x-ray diffractometer using Cu K_{\alpha} radiation. The Rietveld refinements were carried out using the fullprof software[47] which also confirmed the single-phase nature of the crystals.

The magnetization measurements were performed using a Quantum Design, Inc., superconducting quantum interference device magnetic properties measurement system (MPMS). We use Gaussian cgs units for the magnetic results and discussion, where the unit of magnetic field H is the Oe = G, but we also use the Tesla, with 1 T = 10^{4} Oe, as a unit of convenience (the magnetic moment output by the MPMS software is in Gaussian cgs units where 1 emu = 1 G cm^{3}).[11] In order to obtain the magnetic moment of the crystals in a particular field H we subtracted the precalibrated magnetic moment of the sample holder (quartz rod/plastic piece and GE varnish that were used to mount the sample for MPMS measurements) in the same H. Due to the small magnitudes of the magnetic moments of the small crystals and the uncertainty in the magnetic moment of the sample holder, the accuracy of the M(H,T) and \chi(T) data of the samples reported here is of order 10%.

The heat capacity measurements were carried out using the relaxation method in a Quantum Design, Inc., physical properties measurement system (PPMS). Temperatures down to 0.45 K were obtained using a ^{3}He attachment to the PPMS. The ab-plane \rho(T) measurements were performed by the standard four-probe ac technique using the ac transport option of the PPMS. The electrical leads were 25 \mum diameter platinum wires attached to the crystals with EPO-TEK P1011 silver epoxy cured at 110 degC for 1 h. The accuracy of \rho is of order 10% due to uncertainties in the geometric factor.

The temperature variation of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{\rm eff} was measured using a tunnel diode resonator (TDR) technique operating at about 15 MHz. The resonator consists

  of an LC tank circuit with a single-layer coil of inductance L\sim 1\muH, a capacitor with capacitance C\sim 100 pF, and a tunnel diode that is biased to the region of negative differential resistance, thus compensating the losses in the circuit. The circuit, therefore, self-oscillates at a frequency f=(2\pi\sqrt{LC})^{-1}. When a sample with magnetic susceptibility \chi is inserted into the coil, the total inductance changes and the resonant frequency shifts accordingly by an amount which is proportional to \chi. The temperature dependence of the resonance frequency shift \Delta f(T) induced by changes in the sample's magnetic response is related to the magnetic susceptibility \chi and hence \lambda_{\rm eff}(T) by [48; 49; 50]

\[\Delta f(T) = -4\pi\,\chi(T)G\] (1) \[\approx -G\,\left\{1-\frac{\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)}{L_{\rm eff}}\tanh\left[ \frac{L_{\rm eff}}{\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)}\right]\right\}\,,\]

where G is a sample- and coil-dependent calibration constant and L_{\rm eff} is the effective sample dimension. [48] The value of G is determined experimentally by pulling the sample out of the coil _in situ_ and measuring the total associated frequency shift \Delta f_{0} so that \Delta\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)=L_{\rm eff}\delta f(T)/\Delta f_{0} where \Delta\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)=\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)-\lambda_{\rm eff}(T_{\rm min}), \delta f(T)=f(T)-f(T_{\rm min}), and T_{\rm min} is the minimum temperature of the measurement. [48] Another way to determine G is by matching the temperature dependence of the skin depth d(T) obtained from the resonator response in the normal state to the measured resistivity \rho(T) by using the relation \delta(T)=(c/2\pi)\sqrt{\rho(T)/f}. [51] The ac magnetic field was applied along the c axis of single crystals of CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2}, so the reported penetration depths are the respective values in the ab plane.

## III Crystallography

The room temperature powder XRD patterns for crushed single crystals of CaPd_{2}As_{2}, SrPd_{2}As_{2}, and BaPd_{2}As_{2} are shown in Figs. 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c), respectively. The weak unindexed peaks marked with stars for BaPd_{2}As_{2} arise from the small amount of flux attached to the surface of the crystals prior to crushing them for the measurements. The Rietveld refinements confirmed the reported ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type body-centered tetragonal structure (space group I4/mmm) of CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2} and the CeMg_{2}Si_{2}-type primitive tetragonal structure (space group P4/mmm) of BaPd_{2}As_{2}. [43; 44]

The refinement profiles for these structural models are shown in Fig. 2. During the final refinements, the thermal parameters B were set to B=0 and the occupancies of the respective atomic sites were fixed to unity since there were no improvements in the quality of fits or significant changes in the lattice parameters or in the As c-axis position parameter z_{\rm As} upon making small changes in B and in the occupancies. The crystallographic and refinement parameters are listed in Tables 1 and 2. For comparison the lattice parameters and z_{\rm As} values from the literature are also listed in Table 1, where good agreement is found.

The c/a ratio and the interlayer As-As distance d_{\rm As-As}=(1-2z_{\rm As})c for (\rm Ca_{x}Sr)Pd_{2}As_{2} and d_{\rm As-As}=2z_{\rm As}c for BaPd_{2}As_{2} are listed in Table 1, where a "layer" is defined as an As-Pd-As slab in Fig. 1. The values of d_{\rm As-As} for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2} are close to the covalent single-bond distance of 2.38 A for As, [52] indicating that these two compounds have

The solid lines through the experimental points are the Rietveld refinement profiles calculated [(a) and (b)] for the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type body-centered tetragonal structure (space group I4/mmm), and (c) for the CeMg_{2}Si_{2}-type primitive tetragonal structure (space group P4/mmm). In (a), (b), and (c), the short vertical bars mark the fitted Bragg peak positions. The lowermost curves represent the differences between the experimental and calculated intensities. The unindexed peaks marked with stars in (c) are peaks from residual PdAs flux on the surface of the samples.

  cT structures.[40] Therefore, as discussed in Sec. I, the formal oxidation state of Pd in these (Ca,Sr)Pd_{2}As_{2} compounds is Pd^{+1}, which is the same formal oxidation state as for Cu in \mathrm{ThCr}_{2}Si_{2}-type SrCu_{2}As_{2}.[40]

## IV Physical properties of CaPd_{2}As_{2} crystals

### Electrical resistivity

The in-plane \rho of CaPd_{2}As_{2} versus T is shown for crystal #1 at H=0 in Fig. 3(a) and for crystal #2 under various H in Fig. 3(b). A sharp zero-field superconducting transition is observed in Fig. 3(b) at T_{\mathrm{c}}=1.28(3) K that is suppressed by H=0.14 T to below 0.45 K. For crystal #1, the superconducting onset is also at 1.8 K as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a). A broad superconducting transition was seen in another crystal (#3) with an onset at 1.8 K and zero resistance at 1.3 K (not shown). Interestingly, the \rho(T) of crystal #2 in Fig. 3(b) exhibits an upturn and peak before the resistivity drops due to superconductivity which is suppressed by a field H\gtrsim 0.08 T. The origin of this \rho(T) peak is not clear. For crystal #1 the residual resistivity at 2 K before entering the superconducting state is \rho_{0}=43\mu\Omega cm and the residual resistivity ratio is \mathrm{RRR}\equiv\rho(300 K)/\rho(2 K)\approx 3.

In the following we fit the normal-state \rho(T) data by the Bloch-Gruneisen (BG) model which describes the electrical resistivity \rho_{\mathrm{BG}}(T) due to scattering of the charge carriers by longitudinal acoustic lattice vibrations in the absence of Umklapp scattering, given by[53, 54]

\[\rho_{\mathrm{BG}}(T/\Theta_{\mathrm{R}})=4\mathcal{R}\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{ \mathrm{R}}}\right)^{5}\int_{0}^{\Theta_{\mathrm{R}}/T}\frac{x^{5}}{(e^{x}-1)( 1-e^{-x})}dx,\] (2a) where \[\Theta_{\mathrm{R}} is the Debye temperature obtained from fitting resistivity measurements, \[\mathcal{R}\] is a material-dependent prefactor that is independent of \[T\] , and \[\rho_{\mathrm{BG}}(T/\Theta_{R}=1)=0.946\,463\,5\,\mathcal{R}.\] (2b) The experimental \[\rho(T)\] data are fitted by \[\rho(T)=\rho_{0}+\rho(\Theta_{\mathrm{R}})\rho_{\mathrm{R}}(T/\Theta_{\mathrm{ R}}),\] (2c)

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c}  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Wyckoff} & & \\ Atom & symbol & x & y & z \\ \hline CaPd_{2}As_{2} (I4/mmm) & & & & \\ Ca & 2a & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ Pd & 4d & 0 & 1/2 & 1/4 \\ As & 4e & 0 & 0 & 0.3763(3) \\ SrPd_{2}As_{2} (I4/mmm) & & & & \\ Sr & 2a & 0 &  where Eq. (2a) yields the normalized dimensionless BG resistivity

\[\rho_{\rm n}(T/\Theta_{\rm R}) = 4.226\,259\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{\rm R}}\right)^{5}\] (2d) \[\times\int_{0}^{\Theta_{\rm R}/T}\frac{x^{5}}{(e^{\rm c}-1)(1-e^{- x_{\rm c}})}dx.\]

An excellent fit of the \rho(T) data by Eqs. (2) was obtained using the three independent fitting parameters \rho_{0}, \rho(\Theta_{\rm R}), and \Theta_{\rm R} for 2 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K, as shown by the red curve in Fig. 3(a). The single parameter \Theta_{\rm R} determines the T dependence of the fit. While fitting the \rho(T) data we used the analytic Pade approximant function \rho_{\rm n}(T/\Theta_{\rm R}) in place of Eq. (2d) developed in Ref. [54] which accurately describes \rho_{\rm n}(T/\Theta_{\rm R}) and greatly simplifies least-squares fitting of experimental \rho(T) data by the BG theory. The fitting parameters are summarized in Table 3 along with those of the other two compounds discussed below. The \mathcal{R} value is obtained from the fitted value of \rho(\Theta_{\rm R}) using Eq. (2b).

### Heat capacity

#### iii.2.1 Overview of the superconducting and normal-state heat capacity

The C_{\rm p}(T) of a CaPd_{2}As_{2} crystal is shown in Fig. 4 for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K. As shown in the expanded plot of the low-T data in the inset of Fig. 4, a sharp jump is observed in C_{\rm p}(T) due to the occurrence of superconductivity at

The red solid curve is the fitted sum of the contributions from the Debye lattice heat capacity C_{\rm V-D Debye}(T) and predetermined electronic heat capacity \gamma_{\rm x}T according to Eq. (5a). Inset: C_{\rm p}/ TV vs T for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 2.5 K. The dotted red vertical line indicates the T_{\rm c}.

The red curve is a fit by the Bloch-Grüneisen model in the T range 2–300 K. Inset: Expanded plot of \rho(T) below 10 K to show the onset of superconductivity at 2.0 K. (b) Expanded plot of \rho(T) of CaPd_{2}As_{2} crystal \#2 for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 2.5 K showing the superconducting transition for different values of H, as listed, applied along the c axis.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c}  & \rho_{0} & \Theta_{\rm R} & \rho(\Theta_{\rm R}) & \mathcal{R} \\ Compound & (\mu\Omega cm) & (K) & (\mu\Omega cm) & (\mu\Omega cm) \\ \hline CaPd_{2}As_{2} & 42.60(7) & 135(3) & 30.3(5) & 32.0 \\ SrPd_{2}As_{2} & 7.57(6) & 170(3) & 27.6(5) & 29.2 \\ BaPd_{2}As_{2} & 1.02(1) & 114(1) & 8.84(1) & 9.34 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Parameters derived from Bloch-Grüneisen fits to the resistivities \rho within the ab plane of the listed single crystals obtained using Eqs. (2). Here \rho_{0} is the residual resistivity extrapolated to T=0, \Theta_{\rm R} is the Debye temperature determined from resistivity measurements, \rho(\Theta_{\rm R}) is the fitted value of \rho at T=\Theta_{\rm R}, and \mathcal{R} is obtained from the fitted value of \rho(\Theta_{\rm R}) using Eq. (2b). The \rho and \mathcal{R} values do not take into account the systematic error of order 10% arising from uncertainties in the geometric factor required to calculate \rho of a crystal from its measured resistance. The accuracy of \Theta_{\rm R} is not affected by this systematic error since this parameter is determined solely from the T dependence of \rho.

  T_{\rm c}=1.27(3) K. The C_{\rm p}(T) data measured under various H are shown in Fig. 5(a). These data show that the T_{\rm c} decreases with increasing H and is suppressed to below 0.45 K by H=0.15 T.

Plots of C_{\rm p}/T versus T^{2} for H=0 and 0.15 T are shown in Fig. 5(b). We analyzed the normal-state C_{\rm p}(T) data at 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4.5 K for H=0.15 T and the data at 1.5 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4.5 K for H=0 together according to

\[\frac{C_{\rm p}(T)}{T}=\gamma_{\rm n}+\beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4},\] (3)

where \gamma_{\rm n} is the normal-state Sommerfeld electronic heat capacity coefficient, \beta is the Debye T^{3}-law lattice heat capacity coefficient, and \delta T^{4} is a higher-order lattice contribution. A fit of the normal-state data by Eq. (3), shown as the blue curve in Fig. 5(b), gives \gamma_{\rm n}=6.52(2) mJ/mol K^{2}, \beta=0.463(6) mJ/mol K^{4}, and \delta=6.8(4)\muJ/mol K^{6}. We estimate the Debye temperature \Theta_{\rm D} from \beta using the relation [55]

\[\Theta_{\rm D}=\left(\frac{12\pi^{4}Rn}{5\beta}\right)^{1/3},\] (4)

where R is the molar gas constant and n=5 is the number of atoms per formula unit (f.u.), yielding \Theta_{\rm D}=276(1) K.

The measured normal-state C_{\rm p}(T=300 K)=123 J/mol K in Fig. 4 is close to the expected classical Dulong-Petit high-T limiting value C_{\rm V}=3n\,R=15R=124.7 J/mol K at constant volume due to acoustic lattice vibrations. [55, 56] Our normal-state C_{\rm p}(T) data for the T range 2.5 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K were fitted by the sum of the above electronic term \gamma_{\rm n}T and the Debye model lattice heat capacity C_{\rm V\,Debye}(T) per mole of atoms due to acoustic lattice vibrations according to

\[C_{\rm p}(T)=\gamma_{\rm n}T+nC_{\rm V\,Debye}(T/\Theta_{\rm D}),\] (5a) where [56] \[C_{\rm V\,Debye}(T/\Theta_{\rm D})=9R\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{\rm D}}\right)^{3} \int_{0}^{\Theta_{\rm D}/T}\frac{x^{4}e^{x}}{(e^{x}-1)^{2}}\,dx\] (5b) and \[C_{\rm V\,Debye}(T/\Theta_{\rm D}=1) =9R\int_{0}^{1}\frac{x^{4}e^{x}}{(e^{x}-1)^{2}}\,dx\] (5c) \[\approx 2.8552\,R.\]

The integral in Eq. (5c) can be obtained in closed form but the expression is cumbersome. When carrying out the least-squares fit of the experimental C_{\rm p}(T) data by Eqs. (5) we used the high-accuracy analytic Pade approximant for C_{\rm V\,Debye}(T/\Theta_{\rm D}) in Eq. (5b) which we formulated in Ref. [54] that greatly simplifies the fit. The fit was carried out using the fixed value \gamma_{\rm n}=6.52 mJ/mol K^{2} obtained above. Thus, \Theta_{\rm D} is the only adjustable parameter. The fit yielded \Theta_{\rm D}=252(2) K and is shown by the red curve in Fig. 4. This value of \Theta_{\rm D} is close to but slightly smaller than the value \Theta_{\rm D}=276(1) K obtained above from analysis of the low-TC_{\rm p} data. Such differences are expected due to the T dependence of \Theta_{\rm D}. [54, 56]

We estimate the density of states at the Fermi energy for both spin directions obtained from heat capacity measurements \mathcal{D}_{\rm C}(E_{\rm F}) using the relation [55]

\[\gamma_{\rm n}=\frac{\pi^{2}k_{\rm B}^{2}}{3}\,\mathcal{D}_{C}(E_{\rm F}).\] (6)

This \mathcal{D}_{C}(E_{\rm F}) contains the enhancement from the many-body electron-phonon interaction \lambda_{\rm el-ph}. This is also the density of states that enters the BCS equations for T_{\rm c} and for the BCS gap and thermodynamic properties versus T. Using the above \gamma_{\rm n} value gives

\[\mathcal{D}_{C}(E_{\rm F})=2.76\ \ \mathrm{states}/\mathrm{eV}\,\mathrm{f.u.}\] (7)

The enhancements of the bare (band structure) density of states \mathcal{D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F}) and the bare effective mass m_{\rm band}^{*} due to the electron-phonon interaction are [57]

\[\mathcal{D}_{C}(E_{\rm F}) =\mathcal{D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})(1+\lambda_{\rm el-ph}),\] (8a) \[m^{*} =m_{\rm band}^{*}(1+\lambda_{\rm el-ph}),\] (8b)

where \lambda_{\rm el-ph} is the electron-phonon coupling constant.

Figure 5: (Color online) (a) Heat capacity C_{\rm p} versus temperature T of a CaPd_{2}As_{2} single crystal [crystal #2 of Fig. 3(b)] for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 2.0 K measured in different magnetic fields H applied along the c axis. (b) C_{\rm p}/T versus T^{2} for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 3.2 K with H=0 and 0.15 T. The blue curve is a fit of the H=0.15 T data for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4.5 K together with the H=0 data for 1.5 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4.5 K by Eq. (3).

  The \lambda_{\rm el-ph} value can be estimated from McMillan's theory[58] for the electron-phonon mechanism of superconductivity and is related to \Theta_{\rm D} and T_{\rm c} by

\[\lambda_{\rm el-ph}=\frac{1.04+\mu^{*}\ln(\Theta_{\rm D}/1.45\;T_{\rm c})}{(1-0 .62\mu^{*})\ln(\Theta_{\rm D}/1.45\;T_{\rm c})-1.04}.\] (9)

Here \mu^{*} is the repulsive screened Coulomb parameter having a value often between 0.1 and 0.15 and is usually taken as \mu^{*}=0.13. With this value of \mu^{*} together with T_{\rm c}=1.27 K and \Theta_{\rm D}=276 K as determined above (Table 4), Eqs. (8a) and (9) yield

\[\lambda_{\rm el-ph}=0.474,\quad{\cal D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})=1.87(1)\;\;{\rm states }/{\rm eV}\,{\rm f}.{\rm u}.\] (10)

The relatively small value of \lambda_{\rm el-ph} implies weak-coupling superconductivity in CaPd_{2}As_{2}.

A difference of \mu^{*} from the assumed value of 0.13 would give a different value of the calculated \lambda_{\rm el-ph}. For example, from Eq. (9) we obtain \lambda_{\rm el-ph}=0.421 if \mu^{*}=0.10 and \lambda_{\rm el-ph}=0.511 if \mu^{*}=0.15. Such differences would result in corresponding differences in the calculated {\cal D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F}). However, our value of {\cal D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F}) obtained below for the Sr compound using \mu^{*}=0.13 (Table 4) precisely agrees with the value {\cal D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})=1.93\;\;{\rm states}/{\rm eV} f.u. for both spin directions obtained from band calculations for this compound in the reference cited in the _Note added_ at the end of this paper. This agreement also indicates that electron correlation effects are not large, consistent with the sp-band-like nature of the APd_{2}As_{2} compounds that we deduce from the normal-state data.

The values of {\cal D}_{C}(E_{\rm F}), m^{*}, and \rho_{0} can be used to estimate the Fermi velocity (speed) v_{\rm F} and the mean-free path \ell for conduction carrier scattering at low T. In a single-band quasi-free-electron Fermi gas model, v_{\rm F} is[55]

\[v_{\rm F} = \frac{\pi^{2}\hbar^{3}}{m^{*2}V_{\rm f.u.}}{\cal D}_{C}(E_{\rm F})\] (11a) \[= \frac{\pi^{2}\hbar^{3}}{m^{*2}V_{\rm f.u.}}{\cal D}_{\rm band}(E _{\rm F})(1+\lambda_{\rm el-ph}),\] (11b)

where V_{\rm f.u.}=V_{\rm cell}/2 from Table 1 is the volume per formula unit and \hbar is Planck's constant divided by 2\pi. Assuming m^{*}_{\rm band}=m_{\rm e} where m_{\rm e} is the free-electron mass,[59] Eqs. (8b) and (11a) yield

\[v_{\rm F}=1.20\times 10^{8}\;{\rm cm}/{\rm s}.\] (12)

The mean-free path \ell=v_{\rm F}\tau, where \tau is the mean-free scattering time, is obtained from v_{\rm F} using[55]

\[\ell=3\pi^{2}\left(\frac{\hbar}{e^{2}\rho_{0}}\right)\left(\frac{\hbar}{m^{*} v_{\rm F}}\right)^{2},\] (13)

where \hbar/e^{2}=4108\;\Omega. From Eqs. (8), (11a), and (13), the value of m^{*}v_{\rm F} and hence of \ell is independent of \lambda_{\rm el-ph}. Using \rho_{0}=34.6\;\mu\Omega cm (for crystal No. 2), m^{*}_{\rm band}=m_{\rm e} and the value of v_{\rm F} in Eq. (12), Eqs. (8b) and (13) give

\[\ell=1.52\;{\rm nm},\] (14)

which is only 3.6 in-plane lattice constants (Table 1).

The plasma angular frequency \omega_{\rm p} of the conduction carriers can be estimated using the quasi-free-electron single-band relation

\[n=\frac{1}{3\pi^{2}}\left(\frac{m^{*}v_{\rm F}}{\hbar}\right)^{3},\] (15)

yielding[55]

\[\omega_{\rm p}^{2}=\frac{4\pi ne^{2}}{m^{*}}=\frac{4(m^{*}e)^{2}(v_{\rm F}/ \hbar)^{3}}{3\pi}.\] (16)

Using Eq. (8b), m^{*}_{\rm band}=m_{\rm e} and v_{\rm F} from Eq. (12) gives

\[  between the values of \Theta_{\rm D} and \Theta_{\rm R} for each compound indicate that the assumptions [54] of the BG theory are violated in the APd_{2}As_{2} compounds. The BG theory ignores Umklapp carrier scattering; if the Fermi wave vector k_{\rm F} is significantly smaller than the Debye wave vector k_{\rm D}, one might expect \Theta_{\rm D} and \Theta_{\rm R} to be significantly different; and a mechanism such as electron-electron scattering in addition to the electron-phonon scattering assumed in the BG theory could contribute to the T dependence of \rho.

#### iii.2.2 Superconducting state properties

The electronic contribution C_{\rm e}(T) to C_{\rm p}(T) of CaPd_{2}As_{2} obtained at low T by subtracting the low-T phonon contribution \beta T^{3}+\delta T^{5} from C_{\rm p}(T) is shown in Fig. 6(a). The large sharp jump \Delta C_{\rm e} in C_{\rm e} at T_{\rm c}=1.27(3) K indicates that the superconductivity in CaPd_{2}As_{2} is a bulk effect, confirmed below. The vertical heat capacity jump indicated by the vertical dotted line in Fig. 6(b) yields \Delta C_{\rm e}/T_{\rm c}=7.4(2) mJ/mol K^{2} and hence \Delta C_{\rm e}=9.4(3) mJ/mol K. Using the normal-state \gamma_{\rm n}=6.52(2) mJ/mol K^{2} from Table 4, one obtains \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c}=1.14(3) which is much smaller than the BCS value \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c}=1.43 in the weak-coupling limit. [46; 60] Because the bulk superconducting transition in C_{\rm e}(T) is very sharp, we infer that the reduction in \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c} from the BCS value is intrinsic. This reduction can happen if the superconducting gap (order parameter) is anisotropic in wave vector space, either from anisotropy in the gap on a single Fermi surface [46] or from multiple bands with distinct Fermi surfaces, each with a different isotropic or anisotropic gap, [61] as discussed in the context of the \alpha-model below.

#### iii.2.3 Value of \alpha within the \alpha-model

For simplicity, we analyze the zero-field superconducting state thermodynamic data for CaPd_{2}As_{2} within the framework of the so-called \alpha-model of the BCS theory of superconductivity, [46; 62; 63] where \alpha\equiv\Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}. In this model the normalized gap \tilde{\Delta}(T)\equiv\Delta(T)/\Delta(0) is the same as in the BCS theory which is calculated from the BCS gap equation [46; 62] with \alpha=\alpha_{\rm BCS} where

\[\alpha_{\rm BCS}=\pi\ e^{-\gamma_{\rm E}}\approx 1.7639\] (20)

and \gamma_{\rm E}\approx 0.5772 is Euler's constant. However, for calculating the thermodynamic properties, one uses a variable \alpha parameter, which represents an inconsistency in the model, but which allows one to fit superconducting state thermodynamic data that deviate from the BCS predictions. The superconducting and normal state electronic entropies at T_{\rm c} are the same, as in the BCS model, so the superconducting transition is still second order with no latent heat. One can interpret the quantitatively determined deviations from the BCS predictions in terms of other models and theories. For example, values \alpha>\alpha_{\rm BCS} can arise from the presence of strong electron-phonon coupling in contrast to the weak-coupling assumption in the BCS theory, [64] whereas \alpha<\alpha_{\rm BCS} can occur from gap anisotropy in momentum space [46] which we therefore assume is responsible for the reduced heat capacity jump in CaPd_{2}As_{2} compared to the BCS theory prediction.

The value of \alpha is related to the heat capacity jump at T_{\rm c} by [46]

\[\frac{\Delta C_{\rm e}(T_{\rm c})}{\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c}} = \frac{\Delta C_{\rm e}(T_{\rm c})}{\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c}}\bigg{|} _{\rm BCS}\left(\frac{\alpha}{\alpha_{\rm BCS}}\right)^{2}\] (21) \[= \frac{12}{7\zeta(3)}\left(\frac{\alpha}{\alpha_{\rm BCS}}\right)^ {2}\approx 1.426\left(\frac{\alpha}{\alpha_{\rm BCS}}\right)^{2},\]

where \zeta(x) is the Riemann zeta function. Inserting our normalized experimental heat capacity jump value into Eq. (21) gives

\[\alpha=1.58(2),\] (22)

which is significantly smaller than the BCS value of 1.764.

Figure 6: (Color online) (a) Electronic contribution C_{\rm e} to the heat capacity versus temperature T of CaPd_{2}As_{2}. (b) C_{\rm e}/T versus T. The solid red curve in each figure is the theoretical prediction of the \alpha-model in Eq. (23a) for \alpha=1.58. The BCS value is \alpha_{\rm BCS}\approx 1.764. The normal-state heat capacity is C_{\rm en}=\gamma_{\rm e}T with \gamma_{\rm n}=6.52 mJ/mol K^{2}. In (a), this normal-state contribution is the blue straight line and the extrapolation to low T is the dashed blue line. In (b), the normal-state behavior is C_{\rm en}/T=\gamma_{\rm n}.

  The temperature dependence of the superconducting state electronic heat capacity is calculated within the \alpha-model using [46]

\[\frac{C_{\rm es}(t)}{\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c}}=\frac{6\alpha^{3}}{\pi^{2}t}\int_{0 }^{\infty}f(1-f)\left(\frac{\tilde{E}^{2}}{t}-\frac{1}{2}\frac{d\tilde{\Delta}^ {2}}{dt}\right)d\tilde{\epsilon},\] (23a) where \[t=T/T_{\rm c}\] , the normalized normal-state electron energy is \[\tilde{\epsilon}=\epsilon/\Delta(0)\] , the normalized excited quasiparticle (electron and hole) energy is \[\tilde{E}=\frac{E}{\Delta(0)}=\sqrt{\tilde{\epsilon}^{2}+\tilde{\Delta}^{2}},\] (23b) and the Fermi-Dirac distribution function in the dimensionless variables is (with \[E_{\rm F}\equiv 0\] ) \[f\equiv f(\alpha,\tilde{E},t)=\frac{1}{e^{\alpha\tilde{E}/t}+1}\] with \[\frac{E}{k_{\rm B}T}=\frac{\alpha\tilde{E}}{t}.\] (23c)

The t-dependent \tilde{\Delta}(t) and d\tilde{\Delta}(t)/dt^{2} are calculated as described in Ref. [46].

The solid red curves in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) are the theoretical predictions for C_{\rm es}(T) and C_{\rm es}(T)/T, respectively, calculated from Eqs. (23) using \alpha=1.58 and are seen to be in good agreement with the data. The agreement of the lowest-T data with the theory indicates that there is no residual electronic specific heat for T\to 0, which in turn indicates that the entire sample is superconducting with a single nodeless s-wave gap and with a single T_{\rm c}. Because \alpha<\alpha_{\rm BCS}\approx 1.764, we infer that the s-wave order parameter is anisotropic in momentum space as discussed above. [46]

#### iii.1.4 Thermodynamic critical field H_{\rm c}

The experimental thermodynamic critical field H_{\rm c} versus T of a superconductor can be estimated using the zero-field C_{\rm c}(T) data via the electronic entropy difference between the normal (S_{\rm en}) and superconducting (S_{\rm es}) states per unit volume at H=0 according to the Clausius-Clapeyron-type relation [60, 65]

\[S_{\rm en}(T)-S_{\rm es}(T)=-\frac{1}{8\pi}\frac{dH_{\rm c}^{2}(T)}{dT},\] (24a) which, with \[S_{\rm e}(T^{\prime})=\int_{0}^{T^{\prime}}[C_{\rm e}(T^{\prime\prime})/T^{ \prime\prime})]dT^{\prime\prime}\] , yields \[H_{\rm c}^{2}(T)=8\pi\int_{T}^{T_{\rm c}}[S_{\rm en}(T^{\prime})-S_{\rm es}( T^{\prime})]dT^{\prime}.\] (24b)

In cgs units, H_{\rm c} is expressed in units of Oe, where 1 Oe^{2}=1 erg/cm^{3}, so S_{\rm en}(T^{\prime})=\gamma_{\rm av}T^{\prime} is in units of erg/cm^{3} K. The Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma_{\rm av} in units of erg/cm^{3} K^{2} is calculated from the above Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma_{\rm n} in units of mJ/mol K^{2}=10^{4} erg/mol K^{2} according to

\[\gamma_{\rm nV}=\frac{\gamma_{\rm n}}{V_{\rm M}},\] (25)

where V_{\rm M} is the molar volume in units of cm^{3}/mol. For CaPd_{2}As_{2}, our values \gamma_{\rm n}=6.52 mJ/mol K^{2} and V_{\rm M}=55.7 cm^{3}/mol from Table 1 give \gamma_{\rm av}=1170 erg/cm^{3} K^{2}. The experimental H_{\rm c}(T) data obtained from Eqs. (24) are plotted as open circles in Fig. 7(a).

In the \alpha-model, the thermodynamic critical field at T=0 is given by [46]

\[\frac{H_{\rm c}(0)}{\left(\gamma_{\rm av}T_{\rm c}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}=\sqrt{ \frac{6}{\pi}}\;\alpha\approx 1.382\,\alpha.\] (26)

Using our values of \gamma_{\rm av}, \alpha=1.58 and T_{\rm c}=1.27 K gives H_{\rm c}(0)=9.5 mT. The T dependence of H_{\rm c} is calculated

Figure 7: (Color online) (a) Thermodynamic critical field H_{\rm c} versus temperature T obtained for CaPd_{2}As_{2} from the experimentally derived electronic heat capacity C_{\rm c}(T) data using Eqs. (24) (open circles) and the theoretical prediction of the \alpha-model (Refs. [46] and [63]) using T_{\rm c}=1.27 K, \alpha=1.58 and \gamma_{\rm n}=6.52 mJ/mol K^{2} in Eqs. (26) and (27) (red curve). (b) Upper critical magnetic field H_{\rm c}(T) of CaPd_{2}As_{2} determined from the electrical resistivity \rho(T,H) (black open squares) and heat capacity C_{\rm p}(T,H) (blue open circles) data in Figs. 3(b) and 5(a), respectively. The red curve is the prediction for H_{\rm c2}(T) by the WHH theory (Ref. [67]) in Eqs. (32) for dH_{\rm c2}(T)/dT|_{T=T_{\rm c}}=-0.18 T/K, \alpha_{\rm M}=0.13 and \lambda_{\rm av}=0.

  from [46]

\[\frac{H_{\rm c}^{2}(t)}{H_{\rm c}^{2}(0)} = \frac{4\pi^{2}}{3\alpha^{2}}\int_{t}^{1}\left[\frac{S_{\rm m}(t^{ \prime})}{\gamma_{\rm\mu V}T_{\rm c}}-\frac{S_{\rm es}(t^{\prime})}{\gamma_{\rm \mu V}T_{\rm c}}\right]dt^{\prime}\] (27a) \[= \frac{4\pi^{2}}{3\alpha^{2}}\int_{t}^{1}\left[  which for H_{\rm c}(0)=9.5 mT and \kappa_{\rm GL}=11.7 gives H_{\rm c1}(0)=1.4 mT. Then, using the above values and the expression applicable to the high-\kappa_{\rm GL} limit [60]

\[\lambda_{\rm eff}^{2}=\frac{\Phi_{0}H_{\rm c2}}{4\pi\,H_{\rm c}^{2}}.\] (37)

where \Phi_{0}=2.07\times 10^{-7} G cm^{2} is the flux quantum, yields the T\to 0 effective magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{\rm eff}=530 nm in the notation of Tinkham.

The Ginzburg-Landau coherence length at T=0,\xi(0), can be estimated from [60, 65]

\[H_{\rm c2}(0)=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi(0)^{2}}.\] (38)

Using H_{\rm c2}=157 mT gives

\[\xi(0)=45.8\ {\rm nm}.\] (39)

This \xi(0) is much larger than the mean-free path \ell=1.52 nm in Eq. (14) which indicates that CaPd_{2}As_{2} is in the dirty limit.

In the dirty limit the penetration depth at T\to 0 is given by [60]

\[\lambda_{\rm eff}(0)=\lambda_{\rm L}(0)\sqrt{1+\frac{\xi_{0}}{\ell}}\qquad({ \rm dirty\ limit}).\] (40)

The T dependence of \xi is given by [60]

\[\frac{\xi(T)}{\xi_{0}}=\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{3}}\frac{H_{\rm c}(0)}{H_{\rm c}(T) \,\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)},\] (41)

yielding the relationship between the zero-temperature Ginzburg-Landau \xi(0) and the BCS \xi_{0} as

\[\frac{\xi(0)}{\xi_{0}}=\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{3}}\frac{\lambda_{\rm L}(0)}{\lambda_ {\rm eff}(0)}.\] (42)

Combining Eqs. (40) and (42) gives

\[\frac{\xi(0)}{\xi_{0}}=\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{3\left(1+\frac{\xi_{0}}{\ell}\right)} }\qquad({\rm dirty\ limit}).\] (43)

Substituting the above values for \xi(0) in Eq. (39) and \ell in Eq. (14) into Eq. (43) and solving for \xi_{0} gives \xi_{0}=1690 nm. Then, using \lambda_{\rm L}(0)=18.6 nm, \xi_{0}=1690 nm, and \ell=1.52 nm, Eq. (40) gives \lambda_{\rm eff}(0)=620 nm in the dirty limit, similar to the above estimate, which is larger than the value of 210(60) nm obtained from the penetration depth measurements in Sec. VI below.

In the absence of impurity scattering, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter at T=0 would have been \kappa_{\rm GL}=\lambda_{\rm L}^{\rm calc}(0)/\xi_{0}=18.6 nm/1690 nm \approx 0.01\ll 1/\sqrt{2} which would have been in the extreme type-I limit instead of in the type-II regime. A similar situation was found for SrPd_{2}Ge_{2}[59].

The BCS coherence length is related to the Fermi velocity within the \alpha-model by [46]

\[\xi_{0}=\frac{\hbar v_{\rm F}}{\pi\,\Delta(0)}=\left(\frac{1}{\pi\,\alpha} \right)\frac{\hbar v_{\rm F}}{k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}}.\] (44)

This allows an additional estimate of the Fermi velocity which for \alpha=1.58 and \xi_{0}=1690 nm yields v_{\rm F}=1.40\times 10^{8} cm/s. This value of v_{\rm F} is close to the value v_{\rm F}=1.20\times 10^{8} cm/s in Eq. (12) obtained from \mathcal{D}_{\rm C}(E_{\rm F}) according to Eq. (11a), indicating the self-consistency of our modeling.

A summary of the measured and derived superconducting state parameters for CaPd_{2}As_{2} is given in Table 5.

### Magnetization and magnetic susceptibility

Zero-field-cooled (ZFC) \chi(T)=M(T)/H data for a CaPd_{2}As_{2} crystal versus T in a magnetic field H=3.0 T applied along the c axis (\chi_{c}, H\parallel c) and in the ab plane (\chi_{ab}, H\perp c) are shown in Fig. 8. The data for both directions of H are strongly diamagnetic and nearly independent of T except for the Curie-like upturns at low T which were found from analysis of M(H) isotherms in the Appendix to be due to the presence of a small amount of saturable paramagnetic (PM) impurities. The intrinsic \chi(T) values at several temperatures obtained from the analysis of the M(H) isotherms are shown by filled stars in Fig. 8, which are more accurate than the \chi(T)=M(T)/H data. The \chi is anisotropic with \chi_{c}>\chi_{ab} over the entire T range.

The \chi anisotropy in CaPd_{2}As_{2} is different from the anisotropy usually observed in doped and undoped FeAs-based ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-structure compounds, where \chi_{ab}>\chi_{c} such as in BaFe_{2}As_{2}[10, 11]. The powder and temperature average of the

The value of \lambda_{\rm eff}^{\rm obs}(0) is determined from the magnetic penetration depth measurements.

  intrinsic \chi obtained from fitting the M(H) isotherm data in the Appendix over the T range 20 to 300 K is \langle\chi\rangle=[2\langle\chi_{ab}\rangle+\langle\chi_{c}\rangle]/3=-1.5 \times 10^{-4} cm^{3}/mol.

The diamagnetic susceptibilities in Fig. 8 seem to be rather large. For the purpose of comparing the diamagnetic susceptibilities of different materials, a comparison of the thermodynamic dimensionless magnetic susceptibility per unit volume \chi_{\rm V} (volume susceptibility) is most appropriate. Using the molar volume V_{\rm M}=55.7 cm^{3}/mol for CaPd_{2}As_{2} in Table 1 and \chi_{ab}(100 K) = -1.6\times 10^{-4} cm^{3}/mol from Fig. 8 (black star), one obtains \chi_{\rm V}_{\rm sub}_{\rm sub}_{\rm V}_{\rm M} in the ab plane as

\[\chi_{\rm sub}(100\ {\rm K})=-0.29\times 10^{-5}\quad({\rm CaPd_{2}As_{2}}).\] (45)

This value can be compared with the respective values for elemental Bi and C (graphite) that are well known for their exceptionally strong diamagnetism. Bi has a rhombohedral crystal structure with a mass density \rho_{\rm m}=9.8 g/cm^{3} and a gram susceptibility in the hexagonal ab plane \chi_{\rm g,ab}(100\ {\rm K})=-1.9\times 10^{-6} cm^{3}/g.^{72} The volume susceptibility \chi_{\rm V}_{\rm ph}_{\rm X}_{\rm g} is then

\[\chi_{\rm sub}(100\ {\rm K})=-1.9\times 10^{-5}\quad({\rm Bi}).\] (46)

On the other hand, using \rho_{\rm m}=2.27 g/cm^{3} for hexagonal highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and \chi_{\rm g,c}(100\ {\rm K})=-2.3\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/g.^{75} one obtains

\[\chi_{\rm v}(100\ {\rm K})=-5.2\times 10^{-5}\quad({\rm C},\ {\rm HOPG}).\] (47)

These values for Bi and graphite are about 6.5 and 18 times more diamagnetic than the value for CaPd_{2}As_{2} in Eq. (45), respectively. However, these three values are all much less diamagnetic than the value \chi_{\rm V}=-1/4\pi\approx-0.0796 for the diamagnetic susceptibility of a superconductor at low fields with zero demagnetization factor due to complete exclusion of the magnetic induction from the interior (except within a magnetic field penetration depth of the surface).

The different contributions to the intrinsic \chi are

\[\chi=\chi_{\rm core}+\chi_{\rm VV}+\chi_{\rm L}+\chi_{\rm P},\] (48)

where the first three terms are orbital susceptibilities and the last term is the Pauli spin susceptibility of the conduction carriers. \chi_{\rm core} is the isotropic diamagnetic susceptibility of localized core electrons, \chi_{\rm VV} is the generally anisotropic paramagnetic Van Vleck susceptibility, and \chi_{\rm L} is the generally isotropic Landau diamagnetic susceptibility of the conduction carriers.

The \chi_{\rm core} is estimated using atomic diamagnetic susceptibilities^{74} which gives \chi_{\rm core}=-1.78\times 10^{-4} cm^{3}/mol. The \chi_{\rm P} is related to \mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F}) by^{11,75}

\[\chi_{\rm P}=\frac{g^{2}}{4}\mu_{\rm B}^{2}\mathcal{D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F}),\] (49)

where we assume that there are no many-body enhancements to \chi_{\rm P}. Then, using g=2 and \mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F})=1.87 states/eV f.u. for both spin directions, from Table 4 we obtain \chi_{\rm P}=6.0\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol. The \chi_{\rm L} is related to \chi_{\rm P} by^{75,76}

\[\chi_{\rm L}=-\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{m_{\rm e}}{m_{\rm band}^{*}}\right)^{2} \chi_{\rm P},\] (50)

where we assume that \chi_{\rm L} is not enhanced by the electron-phonon interaction. Assuming m_{\rm band}^{*}=m_{\rm e} we obtain \chi_{\rm L}=-2.0\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol from the above value of \chi_{\rm P}. Then, \chi_{\rm VV} is obtained by subtracting these three contributions from the measured \chi according to Eq. (48). The four contributions to the intrinsic \chi are summarized in Table 6, along with corresponding values for SrPd_{2}As_{2} and BaPd_{2}As_{2} determined below.

It is seen in Table 6 that the inferred value of \chi_{\rm VV} for CaPd_{2}As_{2} is negative, which is unphysical. The reason for this error is not clear. The most likely source of the negative \chi_{\rm VV} value is a small error in correcting the total measured magnetic moment for the sample holder contribution, which was up to 40% of the total measured moment. Thus, the uncertainty in the measured \chi values is of order 10% as discussed in Sec. II. In particular, the negative \chi_{\rm VV} is about 8% of the measured moment, and an error of only 4% in the sample holder correction could cause the derived \chi_{\rm VV} to be negative.

The in-plane \rho(T) data for SrPd_{2}As_{2} measured on two different crystals #1 and #2 at different H are shown in Fig. 9. Metallic behavior is evident from the T dependence of \rho in Fig. 9(a). The expanded plot of \rho(T) in Fig. 9(b) reveals a superconducting transition at T_{\rm c}=1.5(1) K. The T_{\rm c} is suppressed with increasing H, as shown. The data in Fig. 9(b) are noisy due to the small sample size and the small voltage signal arising from the small magnitude of the resistivity at low T.

The two crystals were found to have different residual resistivities and RRR values. For crystal #1, \rho_{0}(1.8~{\rm K})=7.5~\mu\Omega cm and RRR = \rho(300~{\rm K})/\rho(1.8~{\rm K})\approx 8, whereas for crystal #2, \rho_{0}=4.9~\mu\Omega cm and RRR \approx 4. The reason the room temperature resistivities of the two crystals are different (\approx 60 and 20~\mu\Omega cm, respectively) is unknown. Since crystal #1 has the higher RRR, we analyzed the \rho(T) data of this crystal in Fig. 9(a) using the BG model. A fit of the \rho(T) data in Fig. 9(a) by Eqs. (2) for 1.8 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K gives \rho_{0}=7.57(6)~\mu\Omega cm, \rho(\Theta_{\rm R})=27.6(5)~\mu\Omega cm, and \Theta_{\rm R}=170(3) K, where we used our analytic Pade approximant [54] in place of the integral in Eq. (2a). The good fit obtained is shown by the red curve in Fig. 9(a). The value of \mathcal{R} obtained from the value of \rho(\Theta_{\rm R}) using Eq. (2b) is \mathcal{R}=29.2~\mu\Omega cm. The parameters obtained from the fit are summarized in Table 3.

### Heat capacity

The C_{\rm p}(T) data for SrPd_{2}As_{2} are shown in Fig. 10. The C_{\rm p}(T=300\,{\rm K})\approx 124~J/mol K is close to the classical Dulong-Petit high-TC_{\rm p}=5R=124.7~J/mol K. In order to correlate low-TC_{\rm p}(T) data with \rho(T) data obtained on the same crystal, we also measured the low-TC_{\rm p}(T) on a different crystal #2 as shown in Fig. 11(a), for which the \rho(T) data are shown in Fig. 9(b). As shown in the inset of Fig. 10, a rather sharp heat capacity jump is observed at T_{\rm c}=0.92(5) K due to the superconducting transition, where we define T_{\rm c} to be the transition midpoint. Two important differences are observed between the C_{\rm p}(T) and \rho(T) data on crystal #2. First, the T_{\rm c} obtained from the two measurements are different: T_{\rm c}=0.92(5) K from C_{\rm p}(T) and T_{\rm c}=1.5(1) K from \rho(T). Second, while the superconductivity is suppressed to a temperature below 0.45 K by H=0.05 T in C_{\rm p}(T), superconductivity occurs at \approx1 K even at H=0.15 T in \rho(T).

Figure 10: (Color online) The heat capacity C_{\rm p} of a SrPd_{2}As_{2} single crystal versus temperature T measured in zero magnetic field H. The red curve is the fitted sum of the contributions from the Debye lattice heat capacity C_{\rm V Debye}(T) and predetermined electronic heat capacity \gamma_{n}T according to Eq. (5a). Inset: Expanded plot of C_{p}/T versus T for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 2.0 K measured on a different crystal (crystal #2 of Fig. 9) at field H=0. The vertical dotted red line indicates the T_{\rm c}.

Figure 9: (Color online) (a) In-plane electrical resistivity \rho of a SrPd_{2}As_{2} crystal (crystal #1) versus temperature T measured in applied magnetic field H=0. The red curve is a fit by the Bloch-Grüneisen model in Eqs. (2). (b) Expanded plot of the low-T\rho(T) data for SrPd_{2}As_{2} crystal #2 for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4 K showing the superconducting transition for different H applied along the c axis. The noise in the data is due to the small size of the crystal and the small magnitude of \rho at low temperatures.

 These two observations suggest the presence of filamentary superconductivity in SrPd_{2}As_{2} which is probed by \rho(T) at temperatures above the bulk T_{\rm c} whereas C_{\rm p}(T) measures the bulk superconductivity.

A fit of the normal-state C_{\rm p}(T)/T versus T^{2} data using the H=0.1 T data for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4.4 K and the H=0 data for 1.3 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4.4 K in Fig. 11(b) by Eq. (3) (the fitted data from 3.2 to 4.4 K are not shown) gives \gamma_{\rm h}=6.43(3) mJ/mol K^{2}, \beta=0.369(8) mJ/mol K^{4}, and \delta=3.7(5)\muJ/mol K^{6} as shown by the red curve. The Debye temperature estimated from \beta using Eq. (4) is \Theta_{\rm D}=298(3) K. A fit of C_{\rm p}(T) in Fig. 10 over the entire T range (2-300 K) by Eqs. (5) with \gamma_{\rm h} fixed to the above value and using the Pade approximant [54] in place of the Debye function gives \Theta_{\rm D}=245(3) K. The fit is shown by the red curve in Fig. 10. The value of \Theta_{\rm D} is smaller than the value of 298(3) K obtained from the low-T fit, indicating a T-dependent \Theta_{\rm D}. [54] The parameters obtained from the analyses of the normal-state C_{\rm p}(T) data are summarized in Table 4.

The electron-phonon coupling constant is estimated from Eq. (9) as \lambda_{\rm el.ph}=0.443 using \mu^{*}=0.13, T_{\rm c}=0.92 K, and \Theta_{\rm D}=298 K. Then we estimate \mathcal{D}_{C}(E_{\rm F})=2.73(2) states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions from Eq. (6) and \mathcal{D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})=1.89(1) states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions from Eq. (8a), which is very close to that of CaPd_{2}As_{2} in Table 4. The Fermi velocity obtained from Eq. (11a) is v_{\rm F}=1.17\times 10^{8} cm/s, and the mean-free path for this value of v_{\rm F} and \rho_{0}=4.9\mu\Omega cm using Eq. (13) is \ell=11.6 nm. The \omega_{\rm p} and \lambda_{\rm L}(0) estimated from Eqs. (16) and (18), respectively, are listed in Table 7.

The electronic contribution C_{\rm e}(T) to the measured low-TC_{\rm p}(T) of SrPd_{2}As_{2}, obtained by subtracting \beta T^{3}+\delta T^{5} from C_{\rm p}(T) according to Eq. (3), is plotted versus T in Fig. 12(a), and C_{\rm e}(T)/T is plotted versus T in Fig. 12(b). Utilizing the entropy-conserving construction in Fig. 12(b) we obtain \Delta C_{\rm e}(T_{\rm c})/T_{\rm c}=5.0(2) mJ/mol K^{2},

Figure 11: (Color online) (a) Heat capacity C_{\rm p} versus temperature T of a SrPd_{2}As_{2} single crystal (crystal #2 of Fig. 9) for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 2.0 K measured at the indicated values of applied magnetic field H with H\parallel c. (b) C_{\rm p}/T vs T^{2} for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 3.2 K with H=0 and 0.1 T. The red curve is a fit of the H=0.1 T data for 0.45 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4.4 K and the H=0 data for 1.3 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4.4 K by Eq. (3) (the fitted data from 3.2 to 4.4 K are not shown).

  \Delta C_{\rm e}(T_{\rm c})=4.6(2){\rm mJ/mol}{\rm K} using T_{\rm c}=0.92(5){\rm K}, and \Delta C_{\rm e}(T_{\rm c})/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c}=0.77(5) using \gamma_{\rm h}=6.43(3){\rm mJ/mol}{\rm K}^{2}. The value of \Delta C_{\rm e}(T_{\rm c})/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c} is significantly smaller than the BCS weak-coupling value of 1.43, as was also the case for CaPd_{2}As_{2} discussed above, and from Eq. (21) we obtain \alpha=1.30(4) which may be compared with the BCS value of 1.764. In Figs. 12(a) and 12(b) we show as the red curves the respective theoretical predictions of the \alpha-model obtained using \alpha=1.30 in Eqs. (23). Also shown as the dashed blue curve in Fig. 12(b) is the theoretical prediction for \alpha=1.50, which is the value that best fits the H_{\rm c}(T) data in Fig. 13(a) below.

The H_{\rm c}(T) for SrPd_{2}As_{2} is obtained by integrating the C_{\rm e}(T) data in Fig. 12 according to Eqs. (24) and the results are shown in Fig. 13(a). The shoulder just above T_{\rm c} arises from the high-T shoulder in the C_{\rm e}(T) data in Figs. 12(a) and 12(b). The value of H_{\rm c}(0) is calculated from Eq. (26) using \alpha=1.30, \gamma_{\rm h}=6.43{\rm mJ/mol}{\rm K}^{2}, and T_{\rm c}=0.92{\rm K}, yielding H_{\rm c}(0)=5.5 mT. The theoretical prediction of the \alpha-model in Eqs. (27) for H_{\rm c}(T) using these parameters is plotted in Fig. 13(a). Although the T dependence of the data is reproduced, the calculated magnitude does not agree with the data. A better fit as shown in Fig. 13(a) by the blue dashed curve is obtained using \alpha=1.50, for which H_{\rm c}(0) is calculated as above to be 6.3 mT.

The H_{\rm c2} versus T data obtained from the above C_{\rm p}(T) and   As already mentioned the two measurements show different T_{\rm c}'s in zero field. Consistent with this difference, the H_{\rm c2}(T) behavior derived from the \rho(T) data indicates that the upper critical field of the filamentary superconductivity is larger than the bulk H_{\rm c2}. The above values of H_{\rm c}(0) for both \alpha=1.30 or 1.50 are much smaller than the bulk H_{\rm c2}(0) extrapolated from the heat capacity data in Fig. 13(b), indicating type-II superconductivity in SrPd_{2}As_{2} as was also found above to be the case in CaPd_{2}As_{2}.

From the C_{\rm p}(T) data in Fig. 13(b) one obtains dH_{\rm c2}(T)/dT|_{T=T,\,\,=-0.12(4)} T/K. Equation (28) then gives H_{\rm c2}^{\rm Orb}(0)=0.077 T in the clean limit and H_{\rm c2}^{\rm Orb}(0)=0.073 T in the dirty limit. Using \alpha=1.30, the Pauli-limiting field is obtained from Eq. (30) as H_{\rm P}(0)=1.37 T and the Maki parameter in Eq. (31) is then \alpha_{\rm M}=0.08. An estimate of H_{\rm c2}(T) obtained from the WHH prediction in Eqs. (32) using \alpha_{\rm M}=0.08 and \lambda_{\rm so}=0 is shown as the solid red curve in Fig. 13(b), from which we obtain H_{\rm c2}(0)=70 mT.

The Ginzburg-Landau parameter is obtained from Eq. (35) using H_{\rm c2}(0)=70 mT and H_{\rm c}(0)=5.5 mT, yielding \kappa_{\rm GL}=9.0. The lower critical field estimated from Eq. (36) is H_{\rm c1}(0)=0.94 mT. The Ginzburg-Landau coherence length at T=0 obtained from Eq. (38) is \xi(0)=69 nm which together with \ell=11.6 nm and Eq. (41) for the dirty limit gives \xi_{0}=509 nm. The Fermi velocity estimated from \xi_{0} using Eq. (44) is v_{\rm F}=0.25\times 10^{8} cm/s for \alpha=1.30 which is of the same order as the above estimated value of v_{\rm F} from the density of states. Corresponding values of the above parameters for \alpha=1.50 were also calculated. A summary of the measured and derived superconducting parameters for SrPd_{2}As_{2} is given in Table 7.

### Magnetization and magnetic susceptibility

The ZFC \chi(T)\equiv M(T)/H data for a SrPd_{2}As_{2} single crystal measured in H=3.0 T are shown in Fig. 14 together with the intrinsic \chi obtained from fitting M(H) isotherm data for H\geqslant 2 T in the Appendix by Eq. (10). These two data sets are in excellent agreement over the whole T range, indicating the near absence of ferromagnetic and saturable paramagnetic impurities in the crystal. The very small upturns below \sim10 K in \chi(T) in Fig. 14 are attributed to a trace amount of paramagnetic impurities. The \chi is diamagnetic and exhibits a weak T dependence with a strong anisotropy \chi_{ab}>\chi_{c}. The large anisotropy in \chi most likely originates from anisotropy in the paramagnetic Van Vleck orbital contribution \chi_{\rm VV} in Eq. (48), although the strong temperature dependence of the anisotropy is unusual and unexpected for such a compound and for which the origin is not clear. Despite having the same crystal structure, the \chi anisotropy in SrPd_{2}As_{2} is opposite to that of CaPd_{2}As_{2} in Fig. 8 for which we observed \chi_{ab}<\chi_{c}. This difference in the sign of the anisotropy between the two compounds is evidently again attributable to a difference in the sign of the anisotropy in the Van Vleck contributions between the two compounds.

The powder and temperature (1.8-300 K) average of the intrinsic \chi obtained from the M(H) isotherms in the Appendix is \langle\chi\rangle=-3.9\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol. The diamagnetic core susceptibility estimated using the atomic diamagnetic susceptibilities [74] is \chi_{\rm core}=-1.93\times 10^{-4} cm^{3}/mol. The Pauli susceptibility estimated from Eq. (49) using \mathcal{D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})=1.89 states/eV f.u. for both spin directions is \chi_{\rm P}=6.1\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol. The \chi_{\rm L}=-2.0\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol was obtained by taking m_{\rm band}^{*}=m_{\rm e} in Eq. (50). Then \langle\chi_{\rm VV}\rangle is obtained from these values using Eq. (48). The various \chi contributions are summarized in Table 6.

VI Magnetic penetration depth measurements of CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2}

Figure 15 shows the temperature variation of the ab-plane magnetic penetration depth \Delta\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)\equiv\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)-\lambda_{\rm eff}(0) measured in CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2} crystals, represented by open circles and triangles, respectively. The absolute value of the penetration depth was obtained using the TDR technique by matching the frequency shift \Delta f(T) to the skin depth \delta calculated from the resistivity. The superconducting transition temperature was determined as the temperature of the maximum of d\Delta\lambda_{\rm eff}/dT. The determined T_{\rm c}'s are 1.34 and 1.26 K for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2}, respectively. These values are higher than the bulk T_{\rm c}'s of 1.27(3) and 0.92(5) K determined from respective C_{\rm p}(T) data (Tables 5 and 71, respectively). Even so, the actual onset of the diamagnetic response is observed at even higher temperatures T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset}=1.50 and 1.72 K for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2}, respectively. The T dependencies of \Delta\lambda_{\rm eff} for the two compounds up to T_{\rm c} are shown in the inset of Fig. 15.

At low temperatures, the \Delta\lambda_{\rm eff}(T) in Fig. 15 of each sample shows a clear saturation on cooling, which is an indication of a fully gapped superconducting order parameter in both compounds. Our compounds are dirty-limit superconductors, for which the magnetic penetration depth in the single-band

The filled stars represent the intrinsic \chi obtained in the Appendix from fitting M(H) isotherm data by Eq. (10). The lines joining the stars are guides to the eye.

  model for T/T_{\rm c}\ll 1 in Tinkham's notation [60] is

\[\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)=\lambda_{\rm L}(T)\sqrt{1+\frac{k_{0}}{\ell}},\] (51a) where \[\lambda_{\rm L}(T)\] is the clean-limit BCS London penetration depth prediction, yielding the \[T=0\] expression in Eq. ( 40 ), and also for \[T/T_{\rm c}\ll 1\] the expression \[\frac{\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)}{\lambda_{\rm eff}(0)}=\frac{\lambda_{\rm L}(T)}{ \lambda_{\rm L}(0)}.\] (51b) Defining \[\Delta\lambda(T)=\lambda(T)-\lambda(0)\] , one obtains \[\frac{\Delta\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)}{\lambda_{\rm eff}(0)}=\frac{\Delta\lambda_{ \rm L}(T)}{\lambda_{\rm L}(0)}.\] (51c)

The right-hand side of this equation is just the clean-limit BCS prediction for local electrodynamics given by [46, 62, 64]

\[\frac{\Delta\lambda_{\rm L}(T)}{\lambda_{\rm L}(0)}=\sqrt{\frac{\pi\,\Delta(0 )}{2k_{\rm B}T}}\,\exp\left[-\frac{\Delta(0)}{k_{\rm B}T}\right].\] (52)

Combining Eqs. (51c) and (52) gives

\[\Delta\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)=\lambda_{\rm eff}(0)\sqrt{\frac{\pi\,\Delta(0)}{2k _{\rm B}T}}\,\exp\left[-\frac{\Delta(0)}{k_{\rm B}T}\right].\] (53)

The experimental data are fitted well up to T\approx T_{\rm c}/3 by Eq. (53) as shown by the solid curves in Fig. 15, where the fitting parameters are \lambda_{\rm eff}(0)=210\pm 60 nm and \Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}=2.02\pm 0.14 K for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and \lambda_{\rm eff}(0)=170\pm 70 nm and \Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}=2.05\pm 0.20 K for SrPd_{2}As_{2}. The listed errors are systematic errors obtained from the spread of the fitting parameters depending on different choices of the upper temperature limit near T_{\rm c}/3.

Using the bulk T_{\rm c} values in Tables 5 and 7 and the above values of \Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}, we obtain \alpha=1.59(14) for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and \alpha=2.23(0.32) for SrPd_{2}As_{2}. The value of \alpha for CaPd_{2}As_{2} is identical within the error bars to the value of 1.58(2) in Eq. (22) that was determined from the heat capacity jump, both of which are smaller than the value \alpha_{\rm BCS}\approx 1.764 expected for an isotropic weak-coupling BCS superconductor [46, 62]. This reduction is most likely due to a moderate anisotropy of the order parameter [46] rather than multiple order parameters because well-known multigap superconductors such as MgB_{2}[77], NbSe_{2}[78], and LiFeAs (Ref. [79]) have shown much lower values of \alpha for the smaller gap. The accuracy of \alpha for SrPd_{2}As_{2} is uncertain because of the significantly larger superconducting transition width obtained from the heat capacity measurements for this compound, and will therefore not be further considered.

The above parameter values obtained for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2} are listed in Tables 5 and 7, respectively.

## VII Physical properties of BaPd_{2}As_{2} crystals

### Electrical resistivity

The in-plane \rho(T) data for a BaPd_{2}As_{2} crystal are shown in Fig. 16. The T dependence of \rho reveals metallic behavior with a very small residual resistivity \rho_{0}\approx 1\mu\Omega cm and a large RRR \approx 25, demonstrating the high quality of the crystal. The scale of the resistivity for BaPd_{2}As_{2} is smaller and the RRR is much larger than those of CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2}. The \rho(T) data were fitted by Eqs. (2) for 2 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K using the analytic Pade approximant function [54] as shown by red curve in Fig. 16. The excellent fit obtained yielded the fitting parameters \rho_{0}=1.02(1)\mu\Omega cm, \rho(\Theta_{\rm R})=8.84(1)\mu\Omega cm, and \Theta_{\rm R}=114(1) K. The value of the constant {\cal R} obtained

Figure 16: (Color online) In-plane electrical resistivity \rho of a BaPd_{2}As_{2} crystal versus temperature T measured in zero magnetic field H. The red curve is a fit by the Bloch-Grüneisen model. Inset: Expanded plot of the low-T\rho(T) data showing the onset of superconductivity at T\lesssim 2.0 K measured at H=0 and 0.05 T applied along the c axis. We infer that this superconductivity is filamentary and not bulk.

Figure 15: (Color online) The change \Delta\lambda_{\rm eff}=\lambda_{\rm eff}(T)-\lambda_{\rm eff}(T\to 0) of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{\rm eff} measured in CaPd_{2}As_{2} (filled circles) and SrPd_{2}As_{2} (filled triangles). The data for SrPd_{2}As_{2} are shifted vertically upwards by 30 nm for clarity. The solid curve for each compound is the best fit of the data by the prediction in Eq. (52) for a single-gap s-wave BCS superconductor for T\lesssim T_{\rm c}/3. The vertical dashed line is the upper temperature limit for the fits. Inset: \Delta\lambda_{\rm eff}(T) for both compounds up to T=T_{\rm c}. The data for SrPd_{2}As_{2} are all shifted upwards by 2\mum for clarity.

  using Eq. (2d) is {\cal R}=9.34\mu\Omega cm. The fit parameters are summarized in Table 3.

The expanded low-T plot of \rho(T) in the inset of Fig. 16 reveals an onset of superconductivity at T_{\rm c\,onset}\approx 2.0 K for H=0 with zero resistance at about 0.6 K. However, the transition width is very large compared to those of CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2}, and the heat capacity measurements in the following section show no evidence for superconductivity above 0.45 K. An applied field of 0.05 T decreases T_{\rm c\,onset} by \approx 0.8 K, as shown.

### Heat capacity

The C_{\rm p}(T) data for BaPd_{2}As_{2} are shown in Fig. 17. Like the other two compounds, the C_{\rm p}(T=300 K) = 124 J/mol K is close to the expected high-T classical Dulong-Petit value. An expanded low-T plot of C_{\rm p}/T versus T^{2} is shown in the inset of Fig. 17. A fit of the data with 0.45 K \leq T\leq 5 K by Eq. (3) yields \gamma_{\rm n}=4.79(2) mJ/mol K^{2}, \beta=0.638(5) mJ/mol K^{4}, and \delta=4.0(3)\muJ/mol K^{6}, as shown by the red curve in the inset. A {\cal D}_{\rm c}(E_{\rm F})=2.03(1) states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions is estimated from \gamma_{\rm n} using Eq. (6). The value \Theta_{\rm D}=248(1) K is obtained from \beta using Eq. (4).

A value \Theta_{\rm D}=227(2) K is obtained by fitting the C_{\rm p}(T) data by Eqs. (5) over the entire T range (2-300 K), as shown by the red curve in Fig. 17. Here again we used the analytic Pade approximant function [54] for C_{\rm V\,Debye}(T) and set \gamma_{\rm n} to the fixed value obtained above from the fit to the low-TC_{\rm p}(T) data. The normal-state parameters obtained from these fits are summarized in Table 4.

In contrast to the observation of the onset of superconductivity in the \rho(T) data at \approx 2.0 K in the inset of Fig. 16, no corresponding feature is observed in the bulk C_{\rm p}(T) data above 0.45 K in the inset of Fig. 17, which indicates that there is no bulk superconductivity in BaPd_{2}As_{2} and hence the superconductivity detected by the \rho(T) measurements is filamentary in nature.

### Magnetization and magnetic susceptibility

The anisotropic \chi(T)\equiv M(T)/H data of a BaPd_{2}As_{2} single crystal in H=3.0 T are shown in Fig. 18. The \chi is diamagnetic over the whole T range and exhibits a weak T dependence. We find that \chi_{c}>\chi_{ab}, which has the same sign of the \chi anisotropy as in CaPd_{2}As_{2} but is opposite to that of SrPd_{2}As_{2}. One must keep in mind in making these comparisons that the crystal structure of BaPd_{2}As_{2} is different from that of CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2}. The intrinsic anisotropic susceptibilities obtained from the slopes of high-field linear fits to the M(H) isotherms in the Appendix are shown by solid stars in Fig. 18. These data are in rather good agreement with the \chi(T)\equiv M(T)/H data in Fig. 18 above 25 K, and indicate that the low-T upturns below 25 K are due to a small amount of paramagnetic impurities.

The different contributions to the intrinsic \chi of BaPd_{2}As_{2} were estimated following the same approach as for the Ca and Sr members above. The powder and temperature average of the intrinsic \chi obtained from the analyses of the M(H) isotherms from 1.8 to 300 K in the Appendix is \langle\chi\rangle=-1.24\times 10^{-4} cm^{3}/mol. We also obtain \chi_{\rm core}=-2.16\times 10^{-4} cm^{3}/mol, \chi_{\rm P}=6.3\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol assuming {\cal D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})={\cal D}_{\rm c}(E_{\rm F}), and \chi_{\rm L}=-2.2\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol [using m_{\rm band}^{*}=m_{\rm e} in Eq. (50)]. A value \langle\chi_{\rm V\rm V}\rangle=4.8\times 10^{-5} cm^{3}/mol is then obtained using Eq. (48). These contributions are summarized in Table 6.

## VIII Summary and conclusions

The crystallographic, electronic transport, thermal, magnetic and superconducting properties of _A_Pd_{2}As_{2} (_A_ = Ca, Sr, Ba) single crystals were investigated. The magnetic measurements in the normal state reveal anisotropic diamagnetism with \chi_{c}>\chi_{ab} for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and BaPd_{2}As_{2}, and \chi_{ab}>\chi_{c} for SrPd_{2}As_{2}. The \chi(T), \rho(T), and C_{\rm p}(T) data indicate sp-band-like metallic behavior of all three compounds and provide conclusive evidence for bulk superconductivity in CaPd_{2}As_{2} and SrPd_{2}As_{2} but only filamentary superconductivity in BaPd_{2}As_{2} which has a different crystal structure. The superconducting transition temperatures as estimated from the zero-field C_{\rm p}(T) data are T_{\rm c}=1.27(3) K for CaPd_{2}As_{2} and T_{\rm c}=0.92(5) K for SrPd_{2}As_{2}. The heat capacity jump at T_{\rm c}, \Delta C_{\rm c}(T_{\rm c}), of CaPd_{2}As_{2} in H = 0 is extremely sharp, which allows unambiguous analysis of the derived electronic contribution C_{\rm c}(T) in the superconducting state. The \Delta C_{\rm c}(T_{\rm c})/\gamma_{\rm s}T_{\rm c}=1.14(3) is significantly smaller than the BCS prediction of 1.43. We analyzed the C_{\rm e}(T) data in the superconducting state using the \alpha-model,[46, 63] where \alpha=\Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}. A good fit to the data was obtained using \alpha=1.58, which is significantly smaller than the BCS value of 1.764 which we surmise is due to anisotropy in the superconducting s-wave gap. The thermodynamic critical field H_{\rm c}(T) is also in agreement with the \alpha-model prediction using the same value of \alpha.

While the \rho(T) data of CaPd_{2}As_{2} exhibit a T_{\rm c} consistent with that obtained from the C_{\rm p}(T) data, the \rho(T) data of SrPd_{2}As_{2} exhibit a higher T_{\rm c} evidently due to filamentary nonbulk superconductivity. Our analysis of the normal and superconducting states \rho(T,H) and C_{\rm p}(T,H) data of these two compounds and estimated superconducting parameters indicate type-II superconductivity with small thermodynamic critical fields and upper critical fields that are much smaller than those of the doped FeAs-based superconductors.

_Note added_. Recently, an electronic structure study of (Ca,Sr,Ba)Pd_{2}As_{2} appeared which largely substantiates our analyses of our experimental data for these compounds and offers additional perspectives.[80]

## Appendix: Presentation and analysis of _M_(_h_) isotherms

### CaPd_{2}As_{2}

The M(H) isotherms for a CaPd_{2}As_{2} crystal measured at eight temperatures between 1.8 and 300 K for H applied both along the c axis (M_{c}, H \parallel c) and in the _ab_ plane (M_{ab}, H \perp c) are shown in Fig. 19. Consistent with the \chi, the M is diamagnetic (negative) and exhibits weak anisotropy with M_{c}(H)>M_{ab}(H). For T\geqslant 50 K, the M(H) curves are almost linear in H, however, at low T a slight nonlinearity is observed that can be attributed to the presence of a small amount of saturable paramagnetic (PM) impurities. Further, the presence of trace amount of ferromagnetic (FM) impurities is also inferred from the M(H) curves.

We estimated the FM impurity contribution by fitting the M(H) data for T\geqslant 50 K and H\geqslant 2 T by

\[M(H)=M_{\rm s}+\chi\,H,\] (10)

where M_{\rm s} is the FM impurity saturation magnetization. For T\geqslant 50 K the M_{\rm s} is found to be almost T independent and anisotropic with values for H\parallel c and H\perp c listed in Table 8. The M_{\rm s} value of 0.48 G cm^{3}/mol for H\parallel c is equivalent to the saturation magnetization of 39 molar ppm of Fe metal impurities suggesting that only trace amounts of FM impurities are present in the crystal. However, due to the small magnitude of the diamagnetic \chi even trace amounts of FM impurities are observable in \chi and M measurements.

Figure 19: (Color online) Isothermal magnetization M of CaPd_{2}As_{2} versus applied magnetic field H at different temperatures, as listed, for magnetic fields applied (a) in the _ab_ plane (H\perp c) and (b) along the c axis (H\parallel c). The solid curves are fits of the M(H) data by Eqs. (11) for 1.0\leqslant H\leqslant 5.5 T.

 Once the FM impurity contributions M_{\rm s} to the magnetizations were determined, we analyzed the low-TM(H) data for both field directions by

\[M(T,H)=M_{\rm s}+\chi\,H+f_{\rm imp}M_{\rm swap}\,B_{\rm S_{\rm sup}}(x).\] (2a) Here, \[\chi is the intrinsic susceptibility of the compound, \[f_{\rm imp}\] is the molar fraction of PM impurities, \[M_{\rm swap}=N_{\rm A}S_{\rm imp}\mu_{\rm B}S_{\rm imp}\] is the PM impurity saturation magnetization, \[N_{\rm A}\] is Avogadro's number, \[\mu_{\rm B}\] is the Bohr magneton, and \[g_{\rm imp}\] and \[S_{\rm imp}\] are the spectroscopic splitting factor (\[g\] factor) and the spin of the impurities, respectively. Our unconventional definition of the Brillouin function \[B_{S_{\rm sup}}\] is [11 ] \[B_{S_{\rm sup}}(x) = \frac{1}{2S_{\rm imp}}\left\{(2S_{\rm imp}+1)\coth\left[(2S_{\rm imp }+1)\frac{x}{2}\right]\right.\] (2b) \[- \left.\coth\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\right\},\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}  & Field & M_{\rm s} & \chi & f_{\rm imp} \\ Compound & direction & \frac{(\rm{S}\,{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{ \rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{ \rm{ }}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}})}} & (10^{-5}\,{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\{\rm{\it{\rm{\it{\rm{\rm{ \it{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{ }}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}

  where

\[x\equiv\frac{g_{\rm imp}\mu_{\rm B}H}{k_{\rm B}(T-\theta_{\rm imp})}.\] (20)

A Weiss temperature \theta_{\rm imp} is included in the argument of B_{S_{\rm imp}}(x) to take into account for interactions between the paramagnetic impurities in an average mean-field way.

While fitting the M(H) data the impurity g factor was set to g_{\rm imp}=2 and the M_{\rm s} values for H\perp c and H\parallel c were set to the values listed in Table 8. The M(H) data for both H directions were fitted for magnetic fields in the range 1.0\leqslant H\leqslant 5.5 T. The S_{\rm imp} values for both H directions were found to be S_{\rm imp}=2.0(2); therefore, in the final fits we set S_{\rm imp}=2. The \theta_{\rm imp} values for both field directions were found to be close to zero and therefore in the final fits we set \theta_{\rm imp}\equiv 0. The solid curves in Fig. 19 show the final fits of the M(H) data by Eqs. (21). The parameters obtained from the fits of the M(H) isotherms at T=1.8 K are listed in Table 8. The intrinsic \chi values obtained from the fits of the M(H) data at different temperatures are shown by stars in Fig. 8. The T dependence of the intrinsic \chi values clearly indicates that the low-T upturns in the measured \chi(T)\equiv M(T)/H data are extrinsic.

## 2 SrPd_{2}As_{2}

The isothermal M(H) data for a SrPd_{2}As_{2} crystal at different T are shown in Fig. 20. Similar to the \chi(T)\equiv M(T)/H data in Fig. 14, the M(H) data exhibit anisotropic diamagnetic behavior with M_{ab}(H)>M_{c}(H). In order to obtain the contributions from the FM impurities, the M(H) data for H\geqslant 2 T at T\geqslant 1.8 K were fitted by Eq. (21) which gave the average M_{\rm s} values of 0.002(4) for H\perp c and 0.02(1) for H\parallel c. The fitting parameters for both H\parallel c and H\perp c for T=1.8 K are listed in Table 8. The intrinsic susceptibilities obtained from the analysis of M(H) data by Eq. (21) are shown by stars in Fig. 14. The paramagnetic impurity concentration is zero within our resolution since no curvature in the M(H) curves on cooling to low T in addition to that due to the FM impurities was detected.

## 3 BaPd_{2}As_{2}

The M(H) isotherms for a BaPd_{2}As_{2} crystal at different T are shown in Fig. 21. The M(H) curves exhibit weakly anisotropic diamagnetic behavior with M_{c}(H)>M_{ab}(H). The intrinsic \chi was obtained by fitting the M(H) isotherms at each T by Eq. (21) for H\geqslant 2 T which yielded temperature-averaged (for T\geqslant 50 K) FM saturation values M_{\rm s}^{ab}=0.18(3) G cm^{2}/mol and M_{\rm s}^{c}=0.20(4) G cm^{2}/mol which are equivalent to the magnetization contributions from 12 and 16 molar ppm of Fe metal impurities, respectively. As in the Sr compound, the paramagnetic impurity concentration is zero within our resolution since no curvature in the M(H) curves on cooling to low T in addition to that due to the FM impurities was detected.
