###### Abstract

We have carried out extensive low-temperature (1.5-10 K) measurements of the critical field H_{c} for the element Pb up to a pressure of P = 1.2 GPa. From these data, the electronic entropy, specific heat, thermal-expansion coefficient, and compressibility are calculated as a function of temperature, pressure, and magnetic field. The zero-field data are consistent with direct thermodynamic measurements, and the P dependence of T_{c} and specific-heat coefficient \gamma(T,P) allows the determination of the P dependence of the pairing interaction.

The thermodynamic and superconducting properties of the metal Pb have been extensively studied, including specific heat,[1, 2] isotope effect,[3, 4] critical field,[5] and thermal expansion.[6] In addition, the effects of pressure on its superconducting properties have also been well studied.[7, 8, 9] Subsequently, the use of the pressure-dependent superconducting transition temperature T_{c}(P) for Pb as a low-temperature magnetometer has also been proposed.[10, 11, 12] The above quoted references are only the early ones, and one would assume that the thermodynamic properties of this material have been comprehensively investigated.

In the course of investigations into the pressure dependence of the oxygen isotope effect on T_{c} for the high-T_{c} superconductor YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}, we used the metal Pb as an internal pressure calibrant. Using a clamp cell in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer, we tracked the pressure using the reported pressure dependence of T_{c} for Pb.[10] Despite the many above-noted early studies on Pb, we discovered that the pressure P and temperature dependences of the critical field H_{c} for Pb have not been reported except at very low pressures (\approx0.03 GPa).[7] We therefore carried out a study of H_{c}(T,P) from 1.5 to 10 K and up to 1.2 GPa from which we have derived a full set of thermodynamic parameters. This paper presents a summary of these measurements and the deduced values of the T and P dependences of the electronic entropy S(T,P), electronic specific-heat coefficient \gamma(T,P), thermal-expansion coefficient \alpha(T,P), and electronic compressibility \kappa(T,P).

The sample used was a bar of dimensions 1.1\times0.93 mm^{2} cross section and 5.58-mm-long, shaped from Puratronic 99.9985%, 2-mm-diameter Pb wire from Johnson Matthey. Using the formulas of Osborn, the demagnetization factor was calculated as 0.97, and this value was used throughout. The Pb sample was annealed in vacuum at 300 ^{\circ}C for 8 h to reduce magnetic hysteresis.[5] This was loaded in a 2.67-mm-diameter, 9-mm-long Teflon capsule along with Fluorinert FC70 and FC77 mixed in 1:1 ratio as a cryogenic hydrostatic pressure medium. The sample capsule was then placed in a miniature homebuilt nonmagnetic Be-Cu (Mico Metal, 97.75% Cu and 2% Be) piston clamp cell [8.8 mm diameter, 65 mm length, with cobalt-free tungsten carbide pistons (Boride)]. The pistons of this cell are lightly tapered using electric-discharge machining.[13] To apply pressure, the cell was preloaded before clamping at room temperature using a laboratory press with calibrated digital pressure gauge (Ashcroft model 2089, 0.05% accuracy). The magnetization measurements were carried out in a Quantum Design MPMS SQUID magnetometer. The pressure in the sample was measured from the reported shift in T_{c} of Pb at zero field.[10] For in-field measurements, the cell was always zero-field cooled to avoid hysteresis error.

Figure 1 shows the measured T dependence of the magnetic moment M up to a field of 700 G and at pressures of 0 GPa (1 bar) and 0.5, 0.9, and 1.15 GPa. T_{c} was determined by the extrapolation to zero of the steepest slope of _M_(_T_). This gives T_{c}(H) which is replotted in Fig. 2 as H_{c}(T,P) versus T. The data show a progressive decline in both T_{c} and H_{c}(T) with increasing pressure. We will see that the combination of these two pressure effects allows access to the pressure dependence of the density of states N(E_{F}) at the Fermi level E_{F} and of the pairing interaction.

To fit these data, we expand H_{c}(T) as a power series in T. The first-order term must be zero, otherwise S_{s}\!\neq\!0 at _T_=0, and the third-order term must also be zero to avoid a negative \gamma at low T. It is usual, therefore, to adopt an even polynomial of the form[5]

\[H_{c}(T,P)=H_{c0}(P)+H_{c1}(P)T^{2}+H_{c2}(P)T^{4},\] (1)

where, as indicated, each of the coefficients is an independent function of pressure. As we will see, H_{c} cannot be linear in T because of the third law requirement that the entropy S\!\rightarrow\!0 as T\!\rightarrow\!0. It turns out that the coefficients are not independent, and it is common to adopt the "similitude principle" which separates the _P_- and _T_-dependent terms as follows:[7]

\[H_{c}(T,P)=H_{c0}(P)f(t)=H_{c0}(P)[1-\alpha t^{2}+(1-\alpha)t^{4}],\] (2)

where t = _T_/_T_. A free fit of Eq. (1) to the data consistently yielded H_{c2}/H_{c0} very close in value to 1-H_{c1}/H_{c0}, consistent with Eq. (2). We therefore proceeded to fit the data with Eq. (2) for all subsequent analyses. The fits are shown by the solid curves through the data shown in Fig. 2. We obtain H_{c0} values of 804.08, 770.88, 739.99, and 729.01 G for P = 0, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.15 GPa, respectively. A linear fit yields

\[H_{c0}(P)=(803.72-67.028P)\text{G}.\] (3) This now allows the scaling of all the data by plotting H_{c}(T,P)/H_{c0}(P) versus t^{2}, as shown in Fig. 3. The small departure from linearity in Fig. 3 reflects the small quartic term (\alpha=0.954 75, 1-\alpha=0.045 25), and the scaled data in Fig. 3 allow a global fit to determine \alpha that provides an overall consistency in the data fits that is necessary when second derivatives of H_{c}(T,P) are used to determine the electronic specific-heat coefficient, thermal-expansion coefficient, or compressibility.

These parameters may be determined as follows. We restrict our thermodynamic parameters to the electronic contribution, thus ignoring the lattice contribution to the specific heat or thermal expansion. The difference in free energy between the normal and superconducting states at the same T and P is given by

\[G_{s}(T,P)=G_{n}(T,P)-\frac{1}{2}\mu_{o}H_{c}(T,P)^{2}V_{M},\] (4)

where \mu_{o} is the permeability of free space and V_{M} is the molar volume. As shown by Shoenberg,[14] the thermodynamic parameters are obtained by differentiation with respect to T and P, giving

\[S_{s}(T,P)=S_{n}(T,P)+\mu_{o}H_{c}V_{M}(\partial H_{c}/\partial T)_{P},\]

\[\gamma_{s}=\gamma_{n}+\mu_{o}V_{M}(\partial H_{c}/\partial T)_{P}-\mu_{o}H_{c} V_{M}(\partial H_{c}/\partial T^{2})_{P},\]

\[V_{s}=V_{n}-\mu_{o}H_{c}V_{M}(\partial H_{c}/\partial P)_{T}\]

\[\alpha_{s}=\alpha_{n}

  entropy, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The linear slope in the normal state is just the above-determined \gamma_{n}(P). The entropy in both states must vanish at T=0. A more rigorous test of the polynomial fits to the data is whether S_{s}/T also vanishes as T\rightarrow 0 and whether the data preserve monotonic systematics in this region. The T dependence of S/T is plotted in Fig. 4(b), and this indeed shows a quadratic behavior at low T, which is perfectly systematic with increasing pressure and extrapolates to zero as T\rightarrow 0. In a finite external field, the same entropy curves are retraced up to the reduced T_{c}(H) value and then the entropy jumps discontinuously to the normal-state value, consistent with a first-order phase transition in magnetic field and second order when H= 0.

The condensation energy U_{o} is determined from

\[U_{o}=\int_{0}^{T_{c}}[S_{n}(T,P)-S_{s}(T,P)]dT,\] (7)

from which we obtain the following values: U_{o}= 47, 43.2, 39.8, and 38.6 mJ/mol for P= 0, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.15 GPa, respectively. The condensation energy reduces with pressure due to the twin effects of reduced T_{c} and reduced \gamma_{n}.

Turning to the specific-heat coefficient, this is calculated using the second equation in Eqs. (5) and is shown in Fig. 5 for both the normal and superconducting states. The entropy balance is evident from the equal areas above and below the temperature, where \gamma_{n}= \gamma_{n}, and is confirmed by the fact shown in Fig. 4(b) that S_{s}/T= \gamma_{n} at T_{c}. We find that the jump in \gamma(T,P) at T_{c} is \Delta\gamma_{c}=7.85, 7.51, 7.05, and 7.17 mJ/(mol K^{2}) for P= 0, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.15 GPa, respectively. Values of \Delta\gamma_{c}/\gamma_{n} are, respectively, 2.33, 2.28, 2.18, and 2.24. There is a weak pressure dependence here in this ratio that is not expected with a simple BCS picture, where \Delta\gamma_{c}/\gamma_{n}=1.55. Direct specific-heat measurements at ambient pressure have obtained various values for \Delta\gamma_{c} such as 7.33\pm0.3 mJ/(mol K^{2}) (Clement and Quinnell [19]), 7.96\pm0.08 mJ/(mol K^{2}) (Shiffman _et al._[20]), and 8.13\pm0.13 mJ/(mol K^{2}) (Neighbor _et al._[21]), in good agreement with our ambient result. Combining with the measurement by Horowitz _et al._[1]\gamma_{n}= 3.13 mJ/(mol K^{2}) gives \Delta\gamma_{c}/\gamma_{n}= 2.34, 2.54, and 2.60, again in good agreement with our present ambient-pressure result. We note that for the purely parabolic form H_{c}=H_{c}^{o}(1-t^{2}), then \Delta\gamma_{c}/\gamma_{n}=2 exactly, and so the experimentally observed excess of \Delta\gamma_{c}/\gamma_{n} is a direct indication of the presence of a higher-order (quartic) term in the T-dependent critical field.

Finally, Fig. 6(a) shows the calculated difference in volume thermal-expansion coefficient between the superconducting and normal states at each pressure and Fig. 6(b)

Figure 4: (Color) The T dependence of (a) the electronic entropy in the normal state and superconducting state for pressures of 0, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.15 GPa and (b) of S/T.

Figure 5: (Color) The T dependence of the specific-heat coefficient \gamma(T,P) in the normal and superconducting states for pressures of 0, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.15 GPa. The small departure from monotonic systematics in the specific-heat jump for 0.9 GPa reflects the accumulation of errors in the second derivatives.

Figure 6: (Color) (a) The T dependence of the difference in volume thermal-expansion coefficient between the superconducting and normal states for pressures of 0, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.15 GPa. (b) The difference in molar volume for the same pressures.

  shows the difference in molar volume. Given that the absolute molar volume at T=0 K is 18.26 cm^{3}/mol, these changes in volume seem extremely small but they are readily measurable. The jumps in thermal-expansion coefficient at T_{c} in zero field are \Delta\alpha=1.91 x 10^{-7}, 1.63 x 10^{-7}, 1.42 x 10^{-7}, and 1.29 x 10^{-7} K^{-1} for P=0, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.15 GPa, respectively. We omit the calculations of the electronic compressibility because these involve double derivatives with respect to pressure and here the errors begin to accumulate markedly. Nonetheless, the discontinuous jumps in isothermal compressibility may be calculated from the Ehrenfest equation for a second-order transition:

\[dT_{c}/dP=\Delta\kappa/\Delta\alpha\] (8)

Empirically we find that

\[T_{c}(P)=7.1863-0.3847P+0.017~69P^{2},\] (9)

so that the absolute jumps in isothermal compressibility at T_{c} in zero field are \Delta\kappa=-7.3\times 10^{-8}, -6.0\times 10^{-8}, -5.0\times 10^{-8}, and -4.4\times 10^{-8} GPa^{-1} for P=0, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.15 GPa, respectively, while the relative jumps are \Delta\kappa/\kappa_{0}=-3.56, -2.93, -2.44, and -2.15 ppm. Direct measurements[22] of the ambient-pressure elastic moduli for Pb in the superconducting state yield \Delta\kappa/\kappa_{0}=-4.0 ppm, again in excellent agreement with our analysis for P=0 GPa.

We conclude by using the above results to estimate the pressure dependence of key parameters in the BCS model.[23] The condensation energy is

\[\frac{1}{2}\mu_{0}H_{c0}(P)=\frac{1}{2}N(0)N_{A}\Delta_{0}^{2}=(47.11-7.75P)~{ }\mathrm{mJ/mol},\] (10)

where P is in gigapascals. The jump in specific heat is given by

\[\gamma_{s}-\gamma_{n}=10.2k_{B}^{2}N(0)N_{A}=(7.85-0.68P)~\mathrm{mJ/(mol~ K^{2})}.\] (11)

Therefore, we obtain

\[N(0)=(1.07-0.093P)~\mathrm{states/atom/eV},\] (12)

\[\Delta_{0}=(11.1-0.432P)\mathrm{K},\] (13)

\[2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=3.09+0.037P.\] (14)

This should be compared with the BCS result 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c} =3.53 and the value of \Delta_{0}=15.76 x 0.05 K observed from tunneling,[24] giving 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=4.37.

If, on the other hand, we determine the DOS from the nearly-free-electron expression[23]

\[\gamma_{n}=(2/3)\,\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}N(0)N_{A}=(3.47-0.232P)~\mathrm{mJ/(mol/K^ {2})},\] (15)

then we obtain

\[N(0)=(0.736-0.0492P)~\mathrm{states/atom/eV},\] (16)

\[\Delta_{0}=(13.7-0.653P)\mathrm{K},\] (17)

\[2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=3.72+0.007P,\] (18)

and the ratio 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c} is more or less pressure independent. Finally, using the BCS expression[23] for T_{c}

\[T_{c}=0.85\Theta_{D}\exp\biggl{(}-\frac{1}{N(0)W}\biggr{)},\] (19)

where \Theta_{D} is the Debye temperature [=96 K for Pb (Ref. [23])] and W is the pairing interaction, then, using Eq. (12),

\[W=(0.343+0.0167P)\mathrm{eV}\] (20)

or, using Eq. (16),

\[W=(0.499+0.0143P)\mathrm{eV}.\] (21)

Here, we have used the Gruneisen coefficient \gamma_{G}=-2.6 for Pb.[25]

In summary, we have measured the pressure dependence of the superconducting critical field in Pb to 1.15 GPa using a clamp cell in a SQUID magnetometer. By using thermodynamic identities, we have determined the electronic free energy, entropy, specific-heat coefficient, thermal-expansion coefficient, and compressibility, including the jumps in these properties at T_{c}. The calculated results match rather well the experimentally observed ambient-pressure data, where it is available. The present results allow calculation of the these parameters as pressure-dependent quantities and an estimation of the pressure dependence of the density of states, superconducting energy gap, and the pairing interaction.

The thermodynamic and superconducting properties of the metal Pb have been extensively studied, including specific heat,[1, 2] isotope effect,[3, 4] critical field,[5] and thermal expansion.[6] In addition, the effects of pressure on its superconducting properties have also been well studied.[7, 8, 9] Subsequently, the use of the pressure-dependent superconducting transition temperature T_{c}(P) for Pb as a low-temperature magnetometer has also been proposed.[10, 11, 12] The above quoted references are only the early ones, and one would assume that the thermodynamic properties of this material have been comprehensively investigated.

This paper presents a summary of these measurements and the deduced values of the T and P dependences of the electronic entropy S(T,P), electronic specific-heat coefficient \gamma(T,P), thermal-expansion coefficient \alpha(T,P), and electronic compressibility \kappa(T,P).

Figure 1 shows the measured T dependence of the magnetic moment M up to a field of 700 G and at pressures of 0 GPa (1 bar) and 0.5, 0.9, and 1.15 GPa. T_{c} was determined by the extrapolation to zero of the steepest slope of _M_(_T_). This gives T_{c}(H) which is replotted in Fig. 2 as H_{c}(T,P) versus T. The data show a progressive decline in both T_{c} and H_{c}(T) with increasing pressure. We will see that the combination of these two pressure effects allows access to the pressure dependence of the density of states N(E_{F}) at the Fermi level E_{F} and of the pairing interaction.

To fit these data, we expand H_{c}(T) as a power series in T. The first-order term must be zero, otherwise S_{s}\!\neq\!0 at _T_=0, and the third-order term must also be zero to avoid a negative \gamma at low T. It is usual, therefore, to adopt an even polynomial of the form[5]

\[H_{c}(T,P)=H_{c0}(P)+H_{c1}(P)T^{2}+H_{c2}(P)T^{4},\] (1)

where, as indicated, each of the coefficients is an independent function of pressure. As we will see, H_{c} cannot be linear in T because of the third law requirement that the entropy S\!\rightarrow\!0 as T\!\rightarrow\!0. It turns out that the coefficients are not independent, and it is common to adopt the "similitude principle" which separates the _P_- and _T_-dependent terms as follows:[7]

\[H_{c}(T,P)=H_{c0}(P)f(t)=H_{c0}(P)[1-\alpha t^{2}+(1-\alpha)t^{4}],\] (2)

where t = _T_/_T_. A free fit of Eq. (1) to the data consistently yielded H_{c2}/H_{c0} very close in value to 1-H_{c1}/H_{c0}, consistent with Eq. (2). We therefore proceeded to fit the data with Eq. (2) for all subsequent analyses. The fits are shown by the solid curves through the data shown in Fig. 2. We obtain H_{c0} values of 804.08, 770.88, 739.99, and 729.01 G for P = 0, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.15 GPa, respectively. A linear fit yields

\[H_{c0}(P)=(803.72-67.028P)\text{G}.\] (3) This now allows the scaling of all the data by plotting H_{c}(T,P)/H_{c0}(P) versus t^{2}, as shown in Fig. 3. The small departure from linearity in Fig. 3 reflects the small quartic term (\alpha=0.954 75, 1-\alpha=0.045 25), and the scaled data in Fig. 3 allow a global fit to determine \alpha that provides an overall consistency in the data fits that is necessary when second derivatives of H_{c}(T,P) are used to determine the electronic specific-heat coefficient, thermal-expansion coefficient, or compressibility.

These parameters may be determined as follows. We restrict our thermodynamic parameters to the electronic contribution, thus ignoring the lattice contribution to the specific heat or thermal expansion. The difference in free energy between the normal and superconducting states at the same T and P is given by

\[G_{s}(T,P)=G_{n}(T,P)-\frac{1}{2}\mu_{o}H_{c}(T,P)^{2}V_{M},\] (4)

where \mu_{o} is the permeability of free space and V_{M} is the molar volume. As shown by Shoenberg,[14] the thermodynamic parameters are obtained by differentiation with respect to T and P, giving

\[S_{s}(T,P)=S_{n}(T,P)+\mu_{o}H_{c}V_{M}(\partial H_{c}/\partial T)_{P},\]

\[\gamma_{s}=\gamma_{n}+\mu_{o}V_{M}(\partial H_{c}/\partial T)_{P}-\mu_{o}H_{c} V_{M}(\partial H_{c}/\partial T^{2})_{P},\]

\[V_{s}=V_{n}-\mu_{o}H_{c}V_{M}(\partial H_{c}/\partial P)_{T}\]

\[\alpha_{s}=\alpha_{n}

  entropy, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The linear slope in the normal state is just the above-determined \gamma_{n}(P). The entropy in both states must vanish at T=0. A more rigorous test of the polynomial fits to the data is whether S_{s}/T also vanishes as T\rightarrow 0 and whether the data preserve monotonic systematics in this region. The T dependence of S/T is plotted in Fig. 4(b), and this indeed shows a quadratic behavior at low T, which is perfectly systematic with increasing pressure and extrapolates to zero as T\rightarrow 0. In a finite external field, the same entropy curves are retraced up to the reduced T_{c}(H) value and then the entropy jumps discontinuously to the normal-state value, consistent with a first-order phase transition in magnetic field and second order when H= 0.

The condensation energy U_{o} is determined from

\[U_{o}=\int_{0}^{T_{c}}[S_{n}(T,P)-S_{s}(T,P)]dT,\] (7)

from which we obtain the following values: U_{o}= 47, 43.2, 39.8, and 38.6 mJ/mol for P= 0, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.15 GPa, respectively. The condensation energy reduces with pressure due to the twin effects of reduced T_{c} and reduced \gamma_{n}.

Turning to the specific-heat coefficient, this is calculated using the second equation in Eqs. (5) and is shown in Fig. 5 for both the normal and superconducting states. The entropy balance is evident from the equal areas above and below the temperature, where \gamma_{n}= \gamma_{n}, and is confirmed by the fact shown in Fig. 4(b) that S_{s}/T= \gamma_{n} at T_{c}. We find that the jump in \gamma(T,P) at T_{c} is \Delta\gamma_{c}=7.85, 7.51, 7.05, and 7.17 mJ/(mol K^{2}) for P= 0, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.15 GPa, respectively. Values of \Delta\gamma_{c}/\gamma_{n} are, respectively, 2.33, 2.28, 2.18, and 2.24. There is a weak pressure dependence here in this ratio that is not expected with a simple BCS picture, where \Delta\gamma_{c}/\gamma_{n}=1.55. Direct specific-heat measurements at ambient pressure have obtained various values for \Delta\gamma_{c} such as 7.33\pm0.3 mJ/(mol K^{2}) (Clement and Quinnell [19]), 7.96\pm0.08 mJ/(mol K^{2}) (Shiffman _et al._[20]), and 8.13\pm0.13 mJ/(mol K^{2}) (Neighbor _et al._[21]), in good agreement with our ambient result. Combining with the measurement by Horowitz _et al._[1]\gamma_{n}= 3.13 mJ/(mol K^{2}) gives \Delta\gamma_{c}/\gamma_{n}= 2.34, 2.54, and 2.60, again in good agreement with our present ambient-pressure result. We note that for the purely parabolic form H_{c}=H_{c}^{o}(1-t^{2}), then \Delta\gamma_{c}/\gamma_{n}=2 exactly, and so the experimentally observed excess of \Delta\gamma_{c}/\gamma_{n} is a direct indication of the presence of a higher-order (quartic) term in the T-dependent critical field.

Finally, Fig. 6(a) shows the calculated difference in volume thermal-expansion coefficient between the superconducting and normal states at each pressure and Fig. 6(b)

Figure 4: (Color) The T dependence of (a) the electronic entropy in the normal state and superconducting state for pressures of 0, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.15 GPa and (b) of S/T.

Figure 5: (Color) The T dependence of the specific-heat coefficient \gamma(T,P) in the normal and superconducting states for pressures of 0, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.15 GPa. The small departure from monotonic systematics in the specific-heat jump for 0.9 GPa reflects the accumulation of errors in the second derivatives.

Figure 6: (Color) (a) The T dependence of the difference in volume thermal-expansion coefficient between the superconducting and normal states for pressures of 0, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.15 GPa. (b) The difference in molar volume for the same pressures.

  shows the difference in molar volume. Given that the absolute molar volume at T=0 K is 18.26 cm^{3}/mol, these changes in volume seem extremely small but they are readily measurable. The jumps in thermal-expansion coefficient at T_{c} in zero field are \Delta\alpha=1.91 x 10^{-7}, 1.63 x 10^{-7}, 1.42 x 10^{-7}, and 1.29 x 10^{-7} K^{-1} for P=0, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.15 GPa, respectively. We omit the calculations of the electronic compressibility because these involve double derivatives with respect to pressure and here the errors begin to accumulate markedly. Nonetheless, the discontinuous jumps in isothermal compressibility may be calculated from the Ehrenfest equation for a second-order transition:

\[dT_{c}/dP=\Delta\kappa/\Delta\alpha\] (8)

Empirically we find that

\[T_{c}(P)=7.1863-0.3847P+0.017~69P^{2},\] (9)

so that the absolute jumps in isothermal compressibility at T_{c} in zero field are \Delta\kappa=-7.3\times 10^{-8}, -6.0\times 10^{-8}, -5.0\times 10^{-8}, and -4.4\times 10^{-8} GPa^{-1} for P=0, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.15 GPa, respectively, while the relative jumps are \Delta\kappa/\kappa_{0}=-3.56, -2.93, -2.44, and -2.15 ppm. Direct measurements[22] of the ambient-pressure elastic moduli for Pb in the superconducting state yield \Delta\kappa/\kappa_{0}=-4.0 ppm, again in excellent agreement with our analysis for P=0 GPa.

We conclude by using the above results to estimate the pressure dependence of key parameters in the BCS model.[23] The condensation energy is

\[\frac{1}{2}\mu_{0}H_{c0}(P)=\frac{1}{2}N(0)N_{A}\Delta_{0}^{2}=(47.11-7.75P)~{ }\mathrm{mJ/mol},\] (10)

where P is in gigapascals. The jump in specific heat is given by

\[\gamma_{s}-\gamma_{n}=10.2k_{B}^{2}N(0)N_{A}=(7.85-0.68P)~\mathrm{mJ/(mol~ K^{2})}.\] (11)

Therefore, we obtain

\[N(0)=(1.07-0.093P)~\mathrm{states/atom/eV},\] (12)

\[\Delta_{0}=(11.1-0.432P)\mathrm{K},\] (13)

\[2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=3.09+0.037P.\] (14)

This should be compared with the BCS result 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c} =3.53 and the value of \Delta_{0}=15.76 x 0.05 K observed from tunneling,[24] giving 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=4.37.

If, on the other hand, we determine the DOS from the nearly-free-electron expression[23]

\[\gamma_{n}=(2/3)\,\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}N(0)N_{A}=(3.47-0.232P)~\mathrm{mJ/(mol/K^ {2})},\] (15)

then we obtain

\[N(0)=(0.736-0.0492P)~\mathrm{states/atom/eV},\] (16)

\[\Delta_{0}=(13.7-0.653P)\mathrm{K},\] (17)

\[2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=3.72+0.007P,\] (18)

and the ratio 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c} is more or less pressure independent. Finally, using the BCS expression[23] for T_{c}

\[T_{c}=0.85\Theta_{D}\exp\biggl{(}-\frac{1}{N(0)W}\biggr{)},\] (19)

where \Theta_{D} is the Debye temperature [=96 K for Pb (Ref. [23])] and W is the pairing interaction, then, using Eq. (12),

\[W=(0.343+0.0167P)\mathrm{eV}\] (20)

or, using Eq. (16),

\[W=(0.499+0.0143P)\mathrm{eV}.\] (21)

Here, we have used the Gruneisen coefficient \gamma_{G}=-2.6 for Pb.[25]

In summary, we have measured the pressure dependence of the superconducting critical field in Pb to 1.15 GPa using a clamp cell in a SQUID magnetometer. By using thermodynamic identities, we have determined the electronic free energy, entropy, specific-heat coefficient, thermal-expansion coefficient, and compressibility, including the jumps in these properties at T_{c}. The calculated results match rather well the experimentally observed ambient-pressure data, where it is available. The present results allow calculation of the these parameters as pressure-dependent quantities and an estimation of the pressure dependence of the density of states, superconducting energy gap, and the pairing interaction.
