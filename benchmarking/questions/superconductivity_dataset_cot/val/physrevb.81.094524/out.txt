###### Abstract

We report the synthesis and characterization of Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} via magnetization, resistivity, specific heat measurements, and low-temperature electron diffraction. At very low levels of intercalation, near Pd_{0.01}TiSe_{2}, the commensurate charge density wave transition in the TiSe_{2} parent compound near 220 K becomes substantially stronger; a distinct transition to a more resistive state is seen at about 80 K. Originally semimetallic, TiSe_{2} becomes an insulator at low temperatures for 0.01 \leq x \leq 0.06 in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2}. Increasing Pd intercalation beyond this level begins to suppress the insulating behavior until a 2 K superconductor is found in the narrow composition range of 0.11 \leq x \leq 0.12. Beyond x = 0.12, a normal metallic state (down to 0.3 K) is induced.

The MX_{2} layered dichalcogenides display a wealth of electronic properties,^{1} from insulators (HfS_{2}) and semiconductors (MoS_{2}) to semimetals (WTe_{2} and TcS_{2}) and metals (NbS_{2} and VSe_{2}). Given their layered structure, charge density wave (CDW) transitions often coexist with superconductivity in these materials and chemical doping^{2,5} or pressure^{4,-6} have often been employed to study the competition between the two correlated electronic states. It is frequently observed that external perturbation destabilizes CDWs and favors an increase in the critical temperature of the superconductivity.

TiSe_{2} is unusual as both an undoped compound^{7,8} and upon Cu intercalation.^{9} For TiSe_{2} only the 1T polytype is known, a structure with a single layer of edge-sharing TiSe_{6} octahedra. The normal state of TiSe_{2} is currently believed to be either a semimetal^{6,-8,10,-15} or a semiconductor^{16,-18} with a small indirect gap. Below \sim220 K, a CDW transition occurs, into a state with a commensurate (2a,2a,2c) wave vector and no intermediate incommensurate phase.^{7,10,19} The origin of the CDW remains controversial, but the consensus is that it is not driven by Fermi surface nesting. No superconductivity has been observed in this compound down to 0.3 K. However, with Cu doping to form Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} (Ref. [9]) the CDW transition is continuously suppressed, continuous evolution to metallic behavior is observed, and superconductivity emerges at around x=0.04. The superconducting transition temperature T_{\rm c} does not evolve monotonically with x; instead, a classic dome of superconductivity is observed, peaking at T_{\rm c}=4.15 K for x=0.08; superconductivity is observed up to the solubility limit x=0.11 in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}. Monovalent nonmagnetic Cu ions act as an n-type dopant, which is manifested in the continuous increase in the metallicity of Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} and the negative Seebeck coefficient,^{9} and seen in the Fermi surface.^{20}

In this paper, we report unexpected, more complex electronic behavior in the analogous Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} system. Like Cu, Pd is a non-magnetic dopant, with one less valence electron per dopant atom than Cu. The system displays four different electronic states at low temperatures as the level of Pd doping is varied over the range of the solid solution, which exists for Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} for 0.00 \leq x \leq 0.18. Very small levels of Pd doping increase the strength of the commensurate CDW in TiSe_{2}, with a distinct second transition near 80 K for x\approx 0.01 leading to more insulating behavior at low temperatures. Although multiple CDW transitions have been observed previously in several compounds,^{21,-25} to our knowledge Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} is the first system where a second electronic transition follows upon further cooling a commensurate high-T CDW. Insulator-like behavior is observed for Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} for 0.01 \leq x \leq 0.06. As x increases further, the CDW transition is driven down in temperature and Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} becomes more metallic until superconductivity is observed for a very narrow concentration range (0.11 < x < 0.12). Beyond this doping level, for 0.14 < x < 0.18, the system changes its low-temperature state again, becoming a normal metal down to 0.3 K.

Polycrystalline samples of Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} for x=0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10, 0.11, 0.12, 0.14, 0.16, and 0.18 were synthesized via solid state reaction. Stoichiometric amounts of Pd, Ti, and Se in powder form were first heated up to 650 ^{\circ}C overnight and then air quenched. Next, the dark purple powders were pressed into pellets and annealed at 650 ^{\circ}C for another day, followed by air quenching to room temperature. Powder x-ray diffraction data were recorded on a Bruker D8 diffractometer, using Cu K\alpha radiation and a graphite diffracted beam monochromator. These measurements confirmed the 1T-TiSe_{2} structure type for the Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} series, with both the a and c lattice parameters increasing with increasing x [Fig. 1(a)]. Quantitative refinement of the x-ray data for Pd_{0.18}TiSe_{2} [Fig. 1(b)] indicates that Pd is intercalated into the octahedral sites in the Van der Waals gaps between the TiSe_{2} layers.

Although the same structural behavior was observed in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2},^{9} its monotonic increase in the lattice parameters was accompanied by a continuous increase in metallic character. Strikingly, Pd intercalation has a substantively different effect on the transport properties of TiSe_{2}. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the smallest amount of Pd doping (x=0.01) increases the low-temperature resistivity of TiSe_{2} by nearly two orders of magnitude. For a limited Pd doping range (0.01 \leq x \leq 0.06), Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} behaves like an insulator, with the low-temperature resistivity nearly one thousand times larger than that at room temperature.

 In order to understand the change in the resistivity of Pd_{x}TiSe_{2}, we have to first consider the unusual \rho(T) for the parent compound: a local maximum that is observed around 150 K in TiSe_{2} (black curve in Fig. 2) has been attributed to the partial gapping of the Fermi surface at the CDW transition.[7] This first yields the increase in \rho(T) upon cooling, followed by a decrease of the resistivity at low enough temperatures as the systems recovers its metallic character due to the presence of ungaped portions of the Fermi surface. We surmise that, with the intercalation of small amounts of Pd, the Fermi surface is more fully gapped and the CDW becomes stronger. This results in a higher resistivity at low temperature in the Pd-doped case than for pure TiSe_{2} (Fig. 2). The additional inflexion below 80 K in the resistivity of the x=0.01 sample, more clearly seen in the derivatives d\rho/dT (red curve, Fig. 2 inset) marks the transition to this stronger CDW state. The strength of the enhanced CDW state is sufficiently large that only for x\,\cong 0.11 does the resistivity of Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} drop for the whole temperature range below 300 K, in contrast to the case for Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}, where continuously dropping resistivity is seen for x\,\cong 0.03.[9] Superconductivity emerges for a narrow Pd concentration (0.11 \,\cong\,x\,\cong 0.12) in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} as shown in Fig. 3, albeit with a smaller critical temperature (T_{\rm c}\,\leq\,2 K) than in the Cu-doped case.

The temperature-dependent magnetization M(T)/H (Fig. 4) is less sensitive to the second electronic transition at low x, but it does show signatures of the initial CDW transition: in the undoped case (black symbols, Fig. 4) a drop in the magnetization below 220 K is associated with the removal of states at the Fermi level as TiSe_{2} enters the CDW state. Pd doping slowly suppresses the CDW transition temperature in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} for low x values, such that T_{\rm CDW} drops to around 160 K for x=0.06. Higher doping levels result in a nearly composition-independent magnetization. The additional capping of the Fermi surface below 80 K is obscured in the magnetization data by a low-temperature Curie-Weiss-like tail. This is likely due to a small local moment induced by Pd doping, with a corresponding magnetic moment smaller than 0.15 \mu_{\rm B}/F.U. and independent of composition for 0\,\cong\,x\,\cong 0.18. Vertical arrows in Fig. 4 indicate the extreme CDW

  transition temperatures, detected in M(T) for x=0 and 0.06 respectively. Due to the same Curie-Weiss increase in the low-temperature data, the CDW transition can no longer be identified in M(T) for doping levels higher than x=0.06 (inset, Fig. 4), for which the magnetization is nearly composition independent.

To directly probe the nature of the low-temperature CDW state, electron diffraction experiments were performed at 11 K on pure TiSe_{2} and doped Pd_{0.01}TiSe_{2} (Fig. 5) using the JEOL 3000F transmission electron microscope equipped with a Gatan liquid-helium cooling stage. The electron diffraction patterns were recorded on 20 bit Ditabis imaging plates for digital analysis. Consistent with the previous reports on the (2a,2a,2c) commensurate CDW in TiSe_{2} (Ref. [7]) and Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}, [9] our measurements show the presence of (1/2,1/2,1/2)-type superreflections at low temperatures in both pure TiSe_{2} [Fig. 5(a)] and in Pd_{0.01}TiSe_{2} [Fig. 5(b)]. Remarkable, however, is that, at T=11 K, the superstructure reflections are much stronger in Pd_{0.01}TiSe_{2} than they are in TiSe_{2}. This indicates that low levels of Pd doping increase the strength of the CDW at low temperatures compared to TiSe_{2}. This much more stable CDW state in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} is harder to destabilize on doping than was the case in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}. [9] The much stronger and more stable CDW in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} explains the insulating electronic state for x =0.01-0.06, and that higher doping levels (x=0.11-0.12) are necessary to induce the CDW-to-superconductivity transition. This stronger CDW stability may also explain why T_{\rm c} is lower for the Pd-doped case, as the interactions leading to the insulating state are not fully suppressed.

The measured room-temperature resistivity values, between 1 and 4 m\Omega cm, do not show a systematic trend with x in the polycrystalline samples, but the scaled resistivity values \rho(300 K)/\rho(4 K), nicely trace the systematic behavior in the series, as seen in Fig. 6. As soon as a small amount (x=0.01) of Pd is intercalated into TiSe_{2}, \rho(300 K)/\rho(4 K) decreases abruptly, and is continuously suppressed in the doping range x=0.01-0.03. Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} becomes more and more insulating as the low-temperature electronic transition becomes stronger and stronger. This is in stark contrast to Cu-doping of TiSe_{2} (Ref. [9]) where increasing Cu content continuously enhances the metallicity, and thus increases the ratio \rho(300 K)/\rho(4 K). For much higher x, the material becomes more metallic. This is seen in the ratio \rho(300 K)/\rho(4 K), which features a sharp increase to a maximum at x=0.11 (Fig. 6). Superconductivity occurs exactly after this sharp increase in metallicity, and then disappears with further doping. The similarities between Cu and Pd doping of TiSe_{2} are thus restored for intermediate

The diffraction pattern in (a) shows much weaker superlattice reflections compared to the analogous ones for the doped sample (b).

The line is a guide to the eye, emphasizing the increase in both quantities at intermediate compositions, and their nearly linear decrease beyond the superconducting state (for x> 0.12).

  -dopant concentrations, but at high x values the two sets of compounds once again show different transport properties: in the former case, the compounds remain good metals, with the ratio \rho(300 K)/\rho(4 K) continuously increasing up to the solubility limit _x_=0.11 in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}. In the current case, beyond the superconducting state, the low-temperature resistivity of Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} increases slowly with x and consequently the ratio \rho(300 K)/\rho(4 K) has a downward trend (Fig. 6).

The electronic specific heat coefficients \gamma for the Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} series are also shown in Fig. 6 (open circles). \gamma has a strikingly similar dependence on x as \rho(300 K)/\rho(4 K): it remains nearly unchanged (\sim1 mJ/mol K^{2}) throughout the insulating regime (_x_ \leq 0.06) and rapidly increases up to \sim4 mJ/mol K^{2} in the superconducting regime. For the normal metal, where any superconductivity, if present, is suppressed below 0.3 K (_x_ >0.12), a decrease in \gamma qualitatively follows the decrease in the resistivity ratio. These results suggest that the dramatic behavior of the composition dependent resistivities in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} up to the superconducting compositions x = 0.11-0.12 primarily reflect changes in the number of carriers present due to the Pd doping. In contrast, and consistent with the continuously increasing metallicity, the Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} series shows a continuous increase in \gamma in the composition range up to x = 0.11.

It is unusual that tuning using a single control parameter, in this case Pd doping of TiSe_{2}, spans such a broad spectrum of electronic properties. This is reflected in the _T-x_ phase diagram in Fig. 7: from a semiconducting or semimetal state in the parent TiSe_{2} compound this system transforms into a commensurate CDW state below 220 K, then into a low temperature more insulating state for low Pd content (_x_ \leq 0.06), then to a superconducting state at low temperatures for intermediate compositions (0.11\leq_x_ \leq 0.12), and finally to normal metallic state for x > 0.12. Multiple CDW transitions have previously been observed in transition metal chalcogenides NbSe_{2},[21] 4Hb-TaS_{2},[22] in tungsten bronzes W_{12} P_{4}O_{44} and W_{14} P_{4}O_{50},[23] in the R = Ho, Er, and Tm members of the R_{3}Ir_{4}Si_{0} series [24] and more recently in the RTe_{3} compounds (R = Ho, Er, and Tm).[25] The observation of a second CDW transition in all of these systems can be attributed to nesting of different regions in the Fermi surface. Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} is novel with regard to the observation of a second transition within the CDW state since the above scenarios do not apply: the CDW in undoped TiSe_{2} is commensurate and its wave vector is preserved with Pd doping. The stability of the high-_T_ CDW, viewed through its transition temperature, is unaffected by Pd doping in the low composition range where the additional low-T transition to the low-temperature insulator is observed (_x_ \leq 0.03); the high-_T_ CDW transition temperature starts decreasing only for x > 0.03. Optical spectroscopy studies performed on the parent compound, TiSe_{2} (Refs. [1] and [14]) indicate that parts of the Fermi surface remain ungaped after the 220 K CDW transition, leaving the compound in a semimetallic state even at low temperatures. It may be that at the lowest Pd concentrations the insulating behavior is induced because the Fermi surface becomes more fully gapped, either by removing portions that were not initially gapped in pure TiSe_{2} or by increasing the difference in energy between filled and empty states.

Both Cu and Pd intercalation of TiSe_{2} ultimately induce superconductivity; for x = 0.04-0.11 and a maximum T_{\rm c} of 4.15 K in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}, and for x = 0.11-0.12 and T_{\rm c} \approx 2 K in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2}, but the evolution of the electronic phases present at low temperatures is much more complex in the Pd-doped case. It is tempting to attribute this to the more ambiguous character of the electronic state of the Pd intercalant. The electron configuration of Cu, 3d^{10}4s^{1}, indicates that in covalent compounds like Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} the high energy Cu 4s state will become empty, yielding its one electron for doping the TiSe_{2} layer. This scenario is verified by the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy characterization of the superconducting phase.[20] For Pd, the electron configuration 4d^{10}5s^{0} means that if the Pd 4d states remain completely filled in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2}, then no electrons are nominally available for doping the TiSe_{2} layer. This type of situation is seen for example in half-Heusler phases such as LuPdSb.[27] Thus, the Pd intercalation of TiSe_{2} is particularly interesting from an electronic perspective--we cannot determine without further study whether the insulating, then superconducting, then metallic states are induced due to electron concentration changes, bandwidth changes, or disorder effects. Finally, Raman scattering studies have indicated that a quantum critical phase transition is present within the superconducting composition region in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2},[26] but whether that occurs in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2}, where the superconductivity occurs in a much narrower composition range, is not yet known. A quantum critical point may exist in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} near a critical composition _x__{\rm c} \approx 0.10 where the CDW disappears, and future low-temperature study may reveal whether this is indeed the case.

###### Abstract

We report the synthesis and characterization of Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} via magnetization, resistivity, specific heat measurements, and low-temperature electron diffraction. At very low levels of intercalation, near Pd_{0.01}TiSe_{2}, the commensurate charge density wave transition in the TiSe_{2} parent compound near 220 K becomes substantially stronger; a distinct transition to a more resistive state is seen at about 80 K. Originally semimetallic, TiSe_{2} becomes an insulator at low temperatures for 0.01 \leq x \leq 0.06 in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2}. Increasing Pd intercalation beyond this level begins to suppress the insulating behavior until a 2 K superconductor is found in the narrow composition range of 0.11 \leq x \leq 0.12. Beyond x = 0.12, a normal metallic state (down to 0.3 K) is induced.

The MX_{2} layered dichalcogenides display a wealth of electronic properties,^{1} from insulators (HfS_{2}) and semiconductors (MoS_{2}) to semimetals (WTe_{2} and TcS_{2}) and metals (NbS_{2} and VSe_{2}). Given their layered structure, charge density wave (CDW) transitions often coexist with superconductivity in these materials and chemical doping^{2,5} or pressure^{4,-6} have often been employed to study the competition between the two correlated electronic states. It is frequently observed that external perturbation destabilizes CDWs and favors an increase in the critical temperature of the superconductivity.

TiSe_{2} is unusual as both an undoped compound^{7,8} and upon Cu intercalation.^{9} For TiSe_{2} only the 1T polytype is known, a structure with a single layer of edge-sharing TiSe_{6} octahedra. The normal state of TiSe_{2} is currently believed to be either a semimetal^{6,-8,10,-15} or a semiconductor^{16,-18} with a small indirect gap. Below \sim220 K, a CDW transition occurs, into a state with a commensurate (2a,2a,2c) wave vector and no intermediate incommensurate phase.^{7,10,19} The origin of the CDW remains controversial, but the consensus is that it is not driven by Fermi surface nesting. No superconductivity has been observed in this compound down to 0.3 K. However, with Cu doping to form Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} (Ref. [9]) the CDW transition is continuously suppressed, continuous evolution to metallic behavior is observed, and superconductivity emerges at around x=0.04. The superconducting transition temperature T_{\rm c} does not evolve monotonically with x; instead, a classic dome of superconductivity is observed, peaking at T_{\rm c}=4.15 K for x=0.08; superconductivity is observed up to the solubility limit x=0.11 in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}. Monovalent nonmagnetic Cu ions act as an n-type dopant, which is manifested in the continuous increase in the metallicity of Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} and the negative Seebeck coefficient,^{9} and seen in the Fermi surface.^{20}

In this paper, we report unexpected, more complex electronic behavior in the analogous Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} system. Like Cu, Pd is a non-magnetic dopant, with one less valence electron per dopant atom than Cu. The system displays four different electronic states at low temperatures as the level of Pd doping is varied over the range of the solid solution, which exists for Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} for 0.00 \leq x \leq 0.18. Very small levels of Pd doping increase the strength of the commensurate CDW in TiSe_{2}, with a distinct second transition near 80 K for x\approx 0.01 leading to more insulating behavior at low temperatures. Although multiple CDW transitions have been observed previously in several compounds,^{21,-25} to our knowledge Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} is the first system where a second electronic transition follows upon further cooling a commensurate high-T CDW. Insulator-like behavior is observed for Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} for 0.01 \leq x \leq 0.06. As x increases further, the CDW transition is driven down in temperature and Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} becomes more metallic until superconductivity is observed for a very narrow concentration range (0.11 < x < 0.12). Beyond this doping level, for 0.14 < x < 0.18, the system changes its low-temperature state again, becoming a normal metal down to 0.3 K.

Polycrystalline samples of Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} for x=0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10, 0.11, 0.12, 0.14, 0.16, and 0.18 were synthesized via solid state reaction. Stoichiometric amounts of Pd, Ti, and Se in powder form were first heated up to 650 ^{\circ}C overnight and then air quenched. Next, the dark purple powders were pressed into pellets and annealed at 650 ^{\circ}C for another day, followed by air quenching to room temperature. Powder x-ray diffraction data were recorded on a Bruker D8 diffractometer, using Cu K\alpha radiation and a graphite diffracted beam monochromator. These measurements confirmed the 1T-TiSe_{2} structure type for the Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} series, with both the a and c lattice parameters increasing with increasing x [Fig. 1(a)]. Quantitative refinement of the x-ray data for Pd_{0.18}TiSe_{2} [Fig. 1(b)] indicates that Pd is intercalated into the octahedral sites in the Van der Waals gaps between the TiSe_{2} layers.

Although the same structural behavior was observed in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2},^{9} its monotonic increase in the lattice parameters was accompanied by a continuous increase in metallic character. Strikingly, Pd intercalation has a substantively different effect on the transport properties of TiSe_{2}. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the smallest amount of Pd doping (x=0.01) increases the low-temperature resistivity of TiSe_{2} by nearly two orders of magnitude. For a limited Pd doping range (0.01 \leq x \leq 0.06), Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} behaves like an insulator, with the low-temperature resistivity nearly one thousand times larger than that at room temperature.

 In order to understand the change in the resistivity of Pd_{x}TiSe_{2}, we have to first consider the unusual \rho(T) for the parent compound: a local maximum that is observed around 150 K in TiSe_{2} (black curve in Fig. 2) has been attributed to the partial gapping of the Fermi surface at the CDW transition.[7] This first yields the increase in \rho(T) upon cooling, followed by a decrease of the resistivity at low enough temperatures as the systems recovers its metallic character due to the presence of ungaped portions of the Fermi surface. We surmise that, with the intercalation of small amounts of Pd, the Fermi surface is more fully gapped and the CDW becomes stronger. This results in a higher resistivity at low temperature in the Pd-doped case than for pure TiSe_{2} (Fig. 2). The additional inflexion below 80 K in the resistivity of the x=0.01 sample, more clearly seen in the derivatives d\rho/dT (red curve, Fig. 2 inset) marks the transition to this stronger CDW state. The strength of the enhanced CDW state is sufficiently large that only for x\,\cong 0.11 does the resistivity of Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} drop for the whole temperature range below 300 K, in contrast to the case for Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}, where continuously dropping resistivity is seen for x\,\cong 0.03.[9] Superconductivity emerges for a narrow Pd concentration (0.11 \,\cong\,x\,\cong 0.12) in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} as shown in Fig. 3, albeit with a smaller critical temperature (T_{\rm c}\,\leq\,2 K) than in the Cu-doped case.

The temperature-dependent magnetization M(T)/H (Fig. 4) is less sensitive to the second electronic transition at low x, but it does show signatures of the initial CDW transition: in the undoped case (black symbols, Fig. 4) a drop in the magnetization below 220 K is associated with the removal of states at the Fermi level as TiSe_{2} enters the CDW state. Pd doping slowly suppresses the CDW transition temperature in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} for low x values, such that T_{\rm CDW} drops to around 160 K for x=0.06. Higher doping levels result in a nearly composition-independent magnetization. The additional capping of the Fermi surface below 80 K is obscured in the magnetization data by a low-temperature Curie-Weiss-like tail. This is likely due to a small local moment induced by Pd doping, with a corresponding magnetic moment smaller than 0.15 \mu_{\rm B}/F.U. and independent of composition for 0\,\cong\,x\,\cong 0.18. Vertical arrows in Fig. 4 indicate the extreme CDW

  transition temperatures, detected in M(T) for x=0 and 0.06 respectively. Due to the same Curie-Weiss increase in the low-temperature data, the CDW transition can no longer be identified in M(T) for doping levels higher than x=0.06 (inset, Fig. 4), for which the magnetization is nearly composition independent.

To directly probe the nature of the low-temperature CDW state, electron diffraction experiments were performed at 11 K on pure TiSe_{2} and doped Pd_{0.01}TiSe_{2} (Fig. 5) using the JEOL 3000F transmission electron microscope equipped with a Gatan liquid-helium cooling stage. The electron diffraction patterns were recorded on 20 bit Ditabis imaging plates for digital analysis. Consistent with the previous reports on the (2a,2a,2c) commensurate CDW in TiSe_{2} (Ref. [7]) and Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}, [9] our measurements show the presence of (1/2,1/2,1/2)-type superreflections at low temperatures in both pure TiSe_{2} [Fig. 5(a)] and in Pd_{0.01}TiSe_{2} [Fig. 5(b)]. Remarkable, however, is that, at T=11 K, the superstructure reflections are much stronger in Pd_{0.01}TiSe_{2} than they are in TiSe_{2}. This indicates that low levels of Pd doping increase the strength of the CDW at low temperatures compared to TiSe_{2}. This much more stable CDW state in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} is harder to destabilize on doping than was the case in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}. [9] The much stronger and more stable CDW in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} explains the insulating electronic state for x =0.01-0.06, and that higher doping levels (x=0.11-0.12) are necessary to induce the CDW-to-superconductivity transition. This stronger CDW stability may also explain why T_{\rm c} is lower for the Pd-doped case, as the interactions leading to the insulating state are not fully suppressed.

The measured room-temperature resistivity values, between 1 and 4 m\Omega cm, do not show a systematic trend with x in the polycrystalline samples, but the scaled resistivity values \rho(300 K)/\rho(4 K), nicely trace the systematic behavior in the series, as seen in Fig. 6. As soon as a small amount (x=0.01) of Pd is intercalated into TiSe_{2}, \rho(300 K)/\rho(4 K) decreases abruptly, and is continuously suppressed in the doping range x=0.01-0.03. Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} becomes more and more insulating as the low-temperature electronic transition becomes stronger and stronger. This is in stark contrast to Cu-doping of TiSe_{2} (Ref. [9]) where increasing Cu content continuously enhances the metallicity, and thus increases the ratio \rho(300 K)/\rho(4 K). For much higher x, the material becomes more metallic. This is seen in the ratio \rho(300 K)/\rho(4 K), which features a sharp increase to a maximum at x=0.11 (Fig. 6). Superconductivity occurs exactly after this sharp increase in metallicity, and then disappears with further doping. The similarities between Cu and Pd doping of TiSe_{2} are thus restored for intermediate

The crystals are tilted away from the (001) zone axis, to show the superreflections in higher-order Laue zones. The diffraction pattern in (a) shows much weaker superlattice reflections compared to the analogous ones for the doped sample (b).

Figure 6: (Color online) p(300 K)/\rho(4 K) (left axis) and electronic specific-heat coefficient \gamma (right axis) as a function of x in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2}. The line is a guide to the eye, emphasizing the increase in both quantities at intermediate compositions, and their nearly linear decrease beyond the superconducting state (for x> 0.12).

  -dopant concentrations, but at high x values the two sets of compounds once again show different transport properties: in the former case, the compounds remain good metals, with the ratio \rho(300 K)/\rho(4 K) continuously increasing up to the solubility limit _x_=0.11 in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}. In the current case, beyond the superconducting state, the low-temperature resistivity of Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} increases slowly with x and consequently the ratio \rho(300 K)/\rho(4 K) has a downward trend (Fig. 6).

The electronic specific heat coefficients \gamma for the Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} series are also shown in Fig. 6 (open circles). \gamma has a strikingly similar dependence on x as \rho(300 K)/\rho(4 K): it remains nearly unchanged (\sim1 mJ/mol K^{2}) throughout the insulating regime (_x_ \leq 0.06) and rapidly increases up to \sim4 mJ/mol K^{2} in the superconducting regime. For the normal metal, where any superconductivity, if present, is suppressed below 0.3 K (_x_ >0.12), a decrease in \gamma qualitatively follows the decrease in the resistivity ratio. These results suggest that the dramatic behavior of the composition dependent resistivities in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} up to the superconducting compositions x = 0.11-0.12 primarily reflect changes in the number of carriers present due to the Pd doping. In contrast, and consistent with the continuously increasing metallicity, the Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} series shows a continuous increase in \gamma in the composition range up to x = 0.11.

It is unusual that tuning using a single control parameter, in this case Pd doping of TiSe_{2}, spans such a broad spectrum of electronic properties. This is reflected in the _T-x_ phase diagram in Fig. 7: from a semiconducting or semimetal state in the parent TiSe_{2} compound this system transforms into a commensurate CDW state below 220 K, then into a low temperature more insulating state for low Pd content (_x_ \leq 0.06), then to a superconducting state at low temperatures for intermediate compositions (0.11\leq_x_ \leq 0.12), and finally to normal metallic state for x > 0.12. Multiple CDW transitions have previously been observed in transition metal chalcogenides NbSe_{2},[21] 4Hb-TaS_{2},[22] in tungsten bronzes W_{12} P_{4}O_{44} and W_{14} P_{4}O_{50},[23] in the R = Ho, Er, and Tm members of the R_{3}Ir_{4}Si_{0} series [24] and more recently in the RTe_{3} compounds (R = Ho, Er, and Tm).[25] The observation of a second CDW transition in all of these systems can be attributed to nesting of different regions in the Fermi surface. Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} is novel with regard to the observation of a second transition within the CDW state since the above scenarios do not apply: the CDW in undoped TiSe_{2} is commensurate and its wave vector is preserved with Pd doping. The stability of the high-_T_ CDW, viewed through its transition temperature, is unaffected by Pd doping in the low composition range where the additional low-T transition to the low-temperature insulator is observed (_x_ \leq 0.03); the high-_T_ CDW transition temperature starts decreasing only for x > 0.03. Optical spectroscopy studies performed on the parent compound, TiSe_{2} (Refs. [1] and [14]) indicate that parts of the Fermi surface remain ungaped after the 220 K CDW transition, leaving the compound in a semimetallic state even at low temperatures. It may be that at the lowest Pd concentrations the insulating behavior is induced because the Fermi surface becomes more fully gapped, either by removing portions that were not initially gapped in pure TiSe_{2} or by increasing the difference in energy between filled and empty states.

Both Cu and Pd intercalation of TiSe_{2} ultimately induce superconductivity; for x = 0.04-0.11 and a maximum T_{\rm c} of 4.15 K in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2}, and for x = 0.11-0.12 and T_{\rm c} \approx 2 K in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2}, but the evolution of the electronic phases present at low temperatures is much more complex in the Pd-doped case. It is tempting to attribute this to the more ambiguous character of the electronic state of the Pd intercalant. The electron configuration of Cu, 3d^{10}4s^{1}, indicates that in covalent compounds like Cu_{x}TiSe_{2} the high energy Cu 4s state will become empty, yielding its one electron for doping the TiSe_{2} layer. This scenario is verified by the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy characterization of the superconducting phase.[20] For Pd, the electron configuration 4d^{10}5s^{0} means that if the Pd 4d states remain completely filled in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2}, then no electrons are nominally available for doping the TiSe_{2} layer. This type of situation is seen for example in half-Heusler phases such as LuPdSb.[27] Thus, the Pd intercalation of TiSe_{2} is particularly interesting from an electronic perspective--we cannot determine without further study whether the insulating, then superconducting, then metallic states are induced due to electron concentration changes, bandwidth changes, or disorder effects. Finally, Raman scattering studies have indicated that a quantum critical phase transition is present within the superconducting composition region in Cu_{x}TiSe_{2},[26] but whether that occurs in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2}, where the superconductivity occurs in a much narrower composition range, is not yet known. A quantum critical point may exist in Pd_{x}TiSe_{2} near a critical composition _x__{\rm c} \approx 0.10 where the CDW disappears, and future low-temperature study may reveal whether this is indeed the case.
