###### Abstract

The magnetic and superconducting properties in the single crystals of Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C compounds are investigated by temperature-dependent magnetization _M_(_T_) and in-plane resistivity _r_(_T_). It is found that the superconducting transition temperature is suppressed by adding Tb in the sites of Er and it follows well de Gennes scaling for both T_{c} > T_{N} and T_{c} < T_{N}. From the T_{c} variation, the magnetic pair breaking strength of Tb is estimated to be similar to the Er. The antiferromagnetic and weak ferromagnetic transition temperatures show distinct behaviors in terms of the de Gennes factor in the Er-rich (_x_  0.4) and Tb-rich (_x_  0.6) side. These observations will be discussed under the consideration of magnetic ground states of ErNi2B2C and TbNi2B2C and their interactions.

## I Introduction

Since the discovery of quaternary compound of _R_Ni2B2C (_R_ = Y, and rare-earth elements), much attention has been focused on the interaction between superconductivity and magnetism as well as superconductivity itself.1 Among them, ErNi2B2C shows superconducting transition at T_{n}  11 K, antiferromagnetic order below T_{N}  6 K with transverse incommensurating modulation vector \delta_{Er} = (0.5526, 0, 0), and weak ferromagnetic component below T_{n}  2 K.23 The coexistence of superconductivity and weak ferromagnetism revitalized the interests on the self-induced vortex states, which has long been predicted but not observed yet in a ferromagnetically ordered superconductors.4 In addition, a large enhancement of the critical currents is observed for all field orientations in the ferromagnetic regime, corresponding to an increase of the pinning force of the flux lattice, probably due to strong pair breaking by the ferromagnetism.3 The nonsuperconducting TbNi2B2C compound exhibits the similar magnetic structure to the one of ErNi2B2C below T_{N}  15 K involving an incommensurate antiferromagnetic modulation, which can be described as a longitudinally polarized spin-density wave vector \delta_{Tb} = (0.555, 0, 0).2 Neutron-diffraction and magnetization studies have revealed weak ferromagnetic component below T_{F}  8 K, whereas other report proposed a small ferromagnetic component along with antiferromagnetic ordering even at T_{n}  15 K.68

Based on the magnetic similarity in the magnetic structure and difference in the modulation vector between ErNi2B2C and TbNi2B2C, the study of Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C system is interesting in terms of both magnetism and superconductivity. It may be possible to increase the T_{F} by replacing the Er elements with Tb to enhance the effects of the weak ferromagnetic component. It is shown that the superconducting _T__c_s of the _R_Ni2B2C (_R_ = Lu, Y, Tm, Er, Ho, and Dy) are not on an universal curve of Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory, indicating that each rare-earth element has different magnetic pair breaking strength probably due to the microscopic magnetic state caused by crystalline electric-field effect. The T_{c} variation in the Er1-_x_Tb_x_Ni2B2C system will be compared with the other systems to discuss the magnetic pair breaking effects. So far, all of the studies of the Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C compounds are performed with polycrystalline samples and discrepancies exist between them.9-11 It is also shown that the sample homogeneity significantly affects the superconducting properties. Therefore it is worthwhile to study the Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C compounds in a high quality single crystalline form.

## II Experiment

The single crystals of Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C were synthesized by using high-temperature metal flux method as described elsewhere.12 The powder x-ray-diffraction patterns of pulverized single crystals is nicely indexed in terms of tetragonal lattice structure with _I4/mmm_ symmetry group, indicating single phase without noticeable impurities. It is found that the grown crystals are platelike and the c axis of the single crystals is normal to their flat surfaces. dc magnetization measurements are performed with the applied field parallel to the _ab_ plane by using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS). The zero-field electrical resistivity is measured by standard four-probe method under the temperature and field control of the SQUID. The contact resistance is lowered below 1 \Omega.

## III Results and Discussion

The temperature-dependent resistivity _r_(_T_) and magnetization divided by applied field _M_(_T_)/_H_ were measured for the single crystals of Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C (_x_ = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0) in order to study the superconductivity, magnetism and their interplay in the temperature range of 2 <= T  20 K. As a representative data set, the _r_(_T_) and _M_(_T_) for Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C (_x_ = 0.25) are plotted in Fig. 1(a). Figure 1(b) shows a temperature derivative of the _M_(_T_) and a expanded plot for the _r_(_T_) of Fig. 1(a). The _r_(_T_) is measured in zero applied field and the _M_(_T_) is done under H = 100 G, perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis. The antiferromagnetic transition, which was found in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C and TbNi_{2}B_{2}C, is manifested itself as the peak in the M(T) near T = 7 K and the Neel temperature T_{N} is defined as the temperature of the peak in the temperature derivative of M(T) as in Fig. 1(b). The zero-field resistivity represents superconducting transition at T = 4 K as a zero resistivity temperature in Fig. 1(a). So, the sudden drop of the magnetization near T = 2 K is due to the superconducting diamagnetic signal where the superconducting transition is suppressed by the external applied field. The antiferromagnetic transition, found in the M(T), is also manifested as a kink in the expanded plot of the \rho(T) in Fig. 1(b), of which the temperature nicely coincides with the T_{N} defined in the temperature derivative of M(T) data. Since the similar behavior of M(T) and \rho(T) for superconducting and antiferromagnetic transition is observed for the specimens of Er_{1-x}Tb_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C with x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, it is straightforward to find the superconducting transition temperatures and Neel temperatures for these compounds.

Figure 2 shows the M(T)/H and \rho(T) data for Er_{1-x}Tb_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C (x = 0.3) with the same measurement conditions as in Fig. 1. It represents the antiferromagnetic transition in M(T) and superconducting transition near T = 2 K. It should be noted that the M(T) data below T_{N} does not show the reduction of magnetization due to superconducting diamagnetic signal as seen in Fig. 1 but rather a slight increase at the lowest temperature available. This low-temperature upturn of the M(T) is observed for the single crystals with the value of 0.3\leqx\leq 1.0. Considering the high quality of single crystals and weak ferromagnetic signals in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C,[3] TbNi_{2}B_{2}C,[7] and Y_{1-x}Tb_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C,[13] the upturn signal of M(T) at low temperature may be an indication of an uncompensated magnetic moment. It would be of great interest to investigate magnetization below T = 2 K.

For the case of Er_{1-x}Tb_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C (x = 0.6), the antiferromagnetic transition in M(T) cannot be defined as clear as for x = 0.25 in Fig. 1 as seen in Fig. 3. A plateau region, rather than a peak, appears below the paramagnetic region with decreasing temperature and an upturn of M(T) with further decreasing temperature. The temperature derivative of the magnetization cannot be used to define the Neel temperature in these data. The upturn of the M(T) at low temperatures is an indication of weak ferromagnetism. The resistivity for the same sample shows metallic behavior down to T = 12 K, upturn for 12\geqT\approx 9 K, and decreases again below 9 K. It is likely that the upturn for 12\geqT\approx 9 K is due to the magnetic fluctuation near the long-range ordering and the decrease below T = 9 K is due to the loss of magnetic scattering below antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering. Since the resistivity onset of magnetic scattering loss in Fig. 1(b) is found to coincide

  with the Neel temperature defined by the temperature derivative of _M_(_T_), the Neel temperatures for x >= 0.6 can be defined as the sudden slope change of the _r_(_T_) data. The resistivity increases due to the magnetic fluctuation for 12 >= T compounds. Er1-_T_bNi2B2C: this work; Y1-_T_bNi2B2C: Ref. [14]; and ErNi2B2C: Ref. [3].

The superconducting and magnetic phase diagram in terms of effective de Gennes (DG) factor, determined from _M_(_T_) and _r_(_T_) data, are plotted in Fig. 4. There is almost no change of T_{N} for the samples of Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C with x <= 0.4 and the T_{N} follows DG values for x >= 0.6. The suppression of the T_{c} with respect to the DG values is seen as expected by Abrikosov-Gor'kov (AG) theory that describes the magnetic effect on the superconductivity in terms of the exchange interaction between the magnetic moments and conduction electrons. The crossover for T_{c} < T_{N} is observed in the sample with x = 0.2 and the AG scaling of the T_{c} is still valid even for the temperatures of T_{c} < T_{N}, contrary to the case of Ho1-_x_Dy3Ni2B2C where the T_{c} is independent of DG values for T_{c} < T_{N}.[14] The observed variations of T_{c} and T_{N} are consistent with the ones in Ref. [11]. However, the superconductivity is observed even for x = 0.3, which is the largest Tb concentration compared with x = 0.2 in Ref. [9] and x = 0.25 in Ref. [11]. This indicates a high homogeneity of single phase in our single crystals. In addition, we are able to identify the weak ferromagnetic signal in the Er-rich side of the samples as a slight increase of magnetization near T = 2 K.

In order to understand the magnetic interactions, the T_{N} versus DG values for the single crystalline samples of Y1-_x_TbNi2B2C,[13] and Ho1-_x_Dy3Ni2B2C,[14] are also plotted in Fig. 4. The dotted line in Fig. 4 is a theoretical DG scaling of T_{N} based on the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between the magnetic moments. As can be seen, the _T__N_'s of the compounds of Y1-_x_TbNi2B2C and TmNi2B2C, which contains only one kind of magnetic ions, follows well the DG scaling as expected. The compounds of Ho1-_Dy3Ni2B2C, Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C, containing two kinds of magnetic ions, reveals different DG scaling, where the Ho1-_x_Dy3Ni2B2C shows simple DG scaling for the whole series and the Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C abnormal behavior. This different behavior can be understood by considering the magnetically ordered structure of each compound. Because the HoNi2B2C and DyNi2B2C have the same magnetic structure below T_{N}, the mixing of the two magnetic ions of Ho and Dy will not change the magnetic interaction strength between them and result in normal DG scaling. However, the magnetic structures of ErNi2B2C and TbNi2B2C are not the same below T_{N} in terms of the modulation vector. If the interaction between the Er and Tb is relatively weak as mentioned above, the interaction between the same kinds of ions will determine the T_{N} variation. The Tb-rich side of Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C will follow the DG expectation as in Y1-_x_TbNi2B2C. On the other hand, the T_{N} values in the Er-rich side of Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C will move toward the one of ErNi2B2C, which is higher than the DG expectation probably due to microscopic magnetic anisotropy.

The weak ferromagnetic temperatures T_{F} can be also accounted for in the two different regions, i.e., Er-rich and Tb-rich regions. The T_{F} in the Er-rich region is almost constant at T >= 2 K, which is same as the one for ErNi2B2C.[3] The T_{F} in the Tb-rich region moves around T = 8 ~ 10 K with increasing Tb concentration. The two different natures of weak ferromagnetic state are manifested themselves in the magnetization data at low temperatures as seen in Figs. 2 and 3. Because the interaction between the two magnetic sites of Er and Tb is relatively weak, no enhancement of T_{F} in the superconducting state by replacing Er with Tb elements is observed in the Er-rich side of the Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C system. For the Tb-rich side of the same samples, the T_{F} jumps to around 9 K, similar to the T_{F} of pure TbNi2B2C.

The normalized superconducting transition temperatures for various samples of single crystals are plotted versus DG values in Fig. 5. As can be seen, the normalized _T__c_'s are not on a universal curve for the DG scaling. This means that each magnetic element has a different magnetic strength as a superconducting pair breaker. This fact is probably due to the magnetic anisotropy caused by the crystalline electric-field (CEF) effect and due to the microscopic magnetic interaction, leading to the different magnetic structures below T_{N}. Because the Gd ion is free from the CEF effect and, consequently, shows an isotropic three-dimensional magnetic nature, the data of the Y1-_x_GdNi2B2C system can be considered as a universal one based on the AG theory.[14] Other magnetic elements, such as Er, Ho, Tb, Dy, which show a two-dimensional magnetic state, exhibit less effective pair breaking than Gd. It is obvious that Er and Tb have similar effects on the superconductivity. It is quite interesting to notice that the ground-state magnetic structures of the both ErNi2B2C and TbNi2B2C below T_{N} consist of AF layers perpendicular to the c axis and the ones of the both HoNi2B2C and DyNi2B2C of alternating ferromagnetic layers.[2] The difference of ErNi2B2C and TbNi2B2C is in the direction of modulation vector of the magnetic moments,

Figure 4: Antiferromagnetic transition temperature T_{N}, superconducting transition temperature T_{c}, and weak ferromagnetic temperature T_{F}, versus de Gennes value (g_{J} −1)2_J_(_J_ + 1) for various compounds. Er1−_x_TbNi2B2C: this work; Y1−_x_TbNi2B2C: Ref. [14]; Ho1−_x_Dy3Ni2B2C: Ref. [14]; and ErNi2B2C: Ref. [3].

  which is perpendicular to the AF ordering axis in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C and parallel to the AF ordering axis in TbNi_{2}B_{2}C. Therefore it seems that the anisotropic magnetic interaction within the ordering plane even above T_{N} has a clear effect on the strength of magnetic pair breaking.

As mentioned above, the T_{c}'s for T_{c}<T_{N} in Er_{1-x}Tb_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C follow AG expectation while the ones in Ho_{1-x}Dy_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C are independent of the DG factor. Recently, the abnormal behavior of the T_{c} of Ho_{1-x}Dy_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C for T_{c}<T_{N} is explained in terms of the cancellation of effective magnetic field at the Ni site by considering the symmetry of magnetic structure below T_{N}.[15] This phenomenological model is suitable in the Ho_{1-x}Dy_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C system because the two compounds of HoNi_{2}B_{2}C and DyNi_{2}B_{2}C have exactly same magnetic ground structures. However, this model cannot be applied to the Er_{1-x}Tb_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C system, studied in this paper, because the two compounds of ErNi_{2}B_{2}C and TbNi_{2}B_{2}C have different magnetic modulation vectors, resulting in no perfect cancellation of the effective magnetic field at Ni site. This behavior is also consistent with the fact that the magnetic interaction between Er and Tb is relatively weak.

## IV Conclusion

The series of Er_{1-x}Tb_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C compounds exhibits variety of magnetism, superconductivity, which were seen in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C and TbNi_{2}B_{2}C, and the interplay between them. The T_{c} of ErNi_{2}B_{2}C is suppressed by adding a Tb element and a crossover for T_{c}<T_{N} occurs at x= 0.2. The T_{c} variation follows well the DG scaling down to T_{c}\approx2 K and x= 0.3 contrary to Ho_{1-x}Dy_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C. From the T_{c} variation, it is conjectured that the magnetic pair breaking strength of Tb in RNi_{2}B_{2}C compounds is comparable with Er probably because of the similar magnetic interaction, leading to the compensated magnetic layer perpendicular to the c axis below T_{N}. However, the difference in terms of the modulation vectors is likely to cause a weak interaction between the Er and Tb in Er_{1-x}Tb_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C, leading to distinct T_{N} and T_{WF} variation with the DG values in Er- and Tb-rich compounds. This means that the observed magnetic subtle effects should be included to make microscopic corrections in the AG theory and magnetic interactions.

###### Abstract

The magnetic and superconducting properties in the single crystals of Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C compounds are investigated by temperature-dependent magnetization _M_(_T_) and in-plane resistivity _r_(_T_). It is found that the superconducting transition temperature is suppressed by adding Tb in the sites of Er and it follows well de Gennes scaling for both T_{c} > T_{N} and T_{c} < T_{N}. From the T_{c} variation, the magnetic pair breaking strength of Tb is estimated to be similar to the Er. The antiferromagnetic and weak ferromagnetic transition temperatures show distinct behaviors in terms of the de Gennes factor in the Er-rich (_x_  0.4) and Tb-rich (_x_  0.6) side. These observations will be discussed under the consideration of magnetic ground states of ErNi2B2C and TbNi2B2C and their interactions.

## I Introduction

Since the discovery of quaternary compound of _R_Ni2B2C (_R_ = Y, and rare-earth elements), much attention has been focused on the interaction between superconductivity and magnetism as well as superconductivity itself.1 Among them, ErNi2B2C shows superconducting transition at T_{n}  11 K, antiferromagnetic order below T_{N}  6 K with transverse incommensurating modulation vector \delta_{Er} = (0.5526, 0, 0), and weak ferromagnetic component below T_{n}  2 K.23 The coexistence of superconductivity and weak ferromagnetism revitalized the interests on the self-induced vortex states, which has long been predicted but not observed yet in a ferromagnetically ordered superconductors.4 In addition, a large enhancement of the critical currents is observed for all field orientations in the ferromagnetic regime, corresponding to an increase of the pinning force of the flux lattice, probably due to strong pair breaking by the ferromagnetism.3 The nonsuperconducting TbNi2B2C compound exhibits the similar magnetic structure to the one of ErNi2B2C below T_{N}  15 K involving an incommensurate antiferromagnetic modulation, which can be described as a longitudinally polarized spin-density wave vector \delta_{Tb} = (0.555, 0, 0).2 Neutron-diffraction and magnetization studies have revealed weak ferromagnetic component below T_{F}  8 K, whereas other report proposed a small ferromagnetic component along with antiferromagnetic ordering even at T_{n}  15 K.68

Based on the magnetic similarity in the magnetic structure and difference in the modulation vector between ErNi2B2C and TbNi2B2C, the study of Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C system is interesting in terms of both magnetism and superconductivity. It may be possible to increase the T_{F} by replacing the Er elements with Tb to enhance the effects of the weak ferromagnetic component. It is shown that the superconducting _T__c_s of the _R_Ni2B2C (_R_ = Lu, Y, Tm, Er, Ho, and Dy) are not on an universal curve of Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory, indicating that each rare-earth element has different magnetic pair breaking strength probably due to the microscopic magnetic state caused by crystalline electric-field effect. The T_{c} variation in the Er1-_x_Tb_x_Ni2B2C system will be compared with the other systems to discuss the magnetic pair breaking effects. So far, all of the studies of the Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C compounds are performed with polycrystalline samples and discrepancies exist between them.9-11 It is also shown that the sample homogeneity significantly affects the superconducting properties. Therefore it is worthwhile to study the Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C compounds in a high quality single crystalline form.

## II Experiment

The single crystals of Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C were synthesized by using high-temperature metal flux method as described elsewhere.12 The powder x-ray-diffraction patterns of pulverized single crystals is nicely indexed in terms of tetragonal lattice structure with _I4/mmm_ symmetry group, indicating single phase without noticeable impurities. It is found that the grown crystals are platelike and the c axis of the single crystals is normal to their flat surfaces. dc magnetization measurements are performed with the applied field parallel to the _ab_ plane by using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS). The zero-field electrical resistivity is measured by standard four-probe method under the temperature and field control of the SQUID. The contact resistance is lowered below 1 \Omega.

## III Results and Discussion

The temperature-dependent resistivity _r_(_T_) and magnetization divided by applied field _M_(_T_)/_H_ were measured for the single crystals of Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C (_x_ = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0) in order to study the superconductivity, magnetism and their interplay in the temperature range of 2 <= T  20 K. As a representative data set, the _r_(_T_) and _M_(_T_) for Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C (_x_ = 0.25) are plotted in Fig. 1(a). Figure 1(b) shows a temperature derivative of the _M_(_T_) and a expanded plot for the _r_(_T_) of Fig. 1(a). The _r_(_T_) is measured in zero applied field and the _M_(_T_) is done under H = 100 G, perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis. The antiferromagnetic transition, which was found in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C and TbNi_{2}B_{2}C, is manifested itself as the peak in the M(T) near T = 7 K and the Neel temperature T_{N} is defined as the temperature of the peak in the temperature derivative of M(T) as in Fig. 1(b). The zero-field resistivity represents superconducting transition at T = 4 K as a zero resistivity temperature in Fig. 1(a). So, the sudden drop of the magnetization near T = 2 K is due to the superconducting diamagnetic signal where the superconducting transition is suppressed by the external applied field. The antiferromagnetic transition, found in the M(T), is also manifested as a kink in the expanded plot of the \rho(T) in Fig. 1(b), of which the temperature nicely coincides with the T_{N} defined in the temperature derivative of M(T) data. Since the similar behavior of M(T) and \rho(T) for superconducting and antiferromagnetic transition is observed for the specimens of Er_{1-x}Tb_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C with x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, it is straightforward to find the superconducting transition temperatures and Neel temperatures for these compounds.

Figure 2 shows the M(T)/H and \rho(T) data for Er_{1-x}Tb_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C (x = 0.3) with the same measurement conditions as in Fig. 1. It represents the antiferromagnetic transition in M(T) and superconducting transition near T = 2 K. It should be noted that the M(T) data below T_{N} does not show the reduction of magnetization due to superconducting diamagnetic signal as seen in Fig. 1 but rather a slight increase at the lowest temperature available. This low-temperature upturn of the M(T) is observed for the single crystals with the value of 0.3\leqx\leq 1.0. Considering the high quality of single crystals and weak ferromagnetic signals in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C,[3] TbNi_{2}B_{2}C,[7] and Y_{1-x}Tb_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C,[13] the upturn signal of M(T) at low temperature may be an indication of an uncompensated magnetic moment. It would be of great interest to investigate magnetization below T = 2 K.

For the case of Er_{1-x}Tb_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C (x = 0.6), the antiferromagnetic transition in M(T) cannot be defined as clear as for x = 0.25 in Fig. 1 as seen in Fig. 3. A plateau region, rather than a peak, appears below the paramagnetic region with decreasing temperature and an upturn of M(T) with further decreasing temperature. The temperature derivative of the magnetization cannot be used to define the Neel temperature in these data. The upturn of the M(T) at low temperatures is an indication of weak ferromagnetism. The resistivity for the same sample shows metallic behavior down to T = 12 K, upturn for 12\geqT\approx 9 K, and decreases again below 9 K. It is likely that the upturn for 12\geqT\approx 9 K is due to the magnetic fluctuation near the long-range ordering and the decrease below T = 9 K is due to the loss of magnetic scattering below antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering.

  with the Neel temperature defined by the temperature derivative of _M_(_T_), the Neel temperatures for x >= 0.6 can be defined as the sudden slope change of the _r_(_T_) data. The resistivity increases due to the magnetic fluctuation for 12 >= T compounds. Er1-_T_bNi2B2C: this work; Y1-_T_bNi2B2C: Ref. [14]; and ErNi2B2C: Ref. [3].

The superconducting and magnetic phase diagram in terms of effective de Gennes (DG) factor, determined from _M_(_T_) and _r_(_T_) data, are plotted in Fig. 4. There is almost no change of T_{N} for the samples of Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C with x <= 0.4 and the T_{N} follows DG values for x >= 0.6. The suppression of the T_{c} with respect to the DG values is seen as expected by Abrikosov-Gor'kov (AG) theory that describes the magnetic effect on the superconductivity in terms of the exchange interaction between the magnetic moments and conduction electrons. The crossover for T_{c} < T_{N} is observed in the sample with x = 0.2 and the AG scaling of the T_{c} is still valid even for the temperatures of T_{c} < T_{N}, contrary to the case of Ho1-_x_Dy3Ni2B2C where the T_{c} is independent of DG values for T_{c} < T_{N}.[14] The observed variations of T_{c} and T_{N} are consistent with the ones in Ref. [11]. However, the superconductivity is observed even for x = 0.3, which is the largest Tb concentration compared with x = 0.2 in Ref. [9] and x = 0.25 in Ref. [11]. This indicates a high homogeneity of single phase in our single crystals. In addition, we are able to identify the weak ferromagnetic signal in the Er-rich side of the samples as a slight increase of magnetization near T = 2 K.

In order to understand the magnetic interactions, the T_{N} versus DG values for the single crystalline samples of Y1-_x_TbNi2B2C,[13] and Ho1-_x_Dy3Ni2B2C,[14] are also plotted in Fig. 4. The dotted line in Fig. 4 is a theoretical DG scaling of T_{N} based on the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between the magnetic moments. As can be seen, the _T__N_'s of the compounds of Y1-_x_TbNi2B2C and TmNi2B2C, which contains only one kind of magnetic ions, follows well the DG scaling as expected. The compounds of Ho1-_Dy3Ni2B2C, Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C, containing two kinds of magnetic ions, reveals different DG scaling, where the Ho1-_x_Dy3Ni2B2C shows simple DG scaling for the whole series and the Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C abnormal behavior. This different behavior can be understood by considering the magnetically ordered structure of each compound. Because the HoNi2B2C and DyNi2B2C have the same magnetic structure below T_{N}, the mixing of the two magnetic ions of Ho and Dy will not change the magnetic interaction strength between them and result in normal DG scaling. However, the magnetic structures of ErNi2B2C and TbNi2B2C are not the same below T_{N} in terms of the modulation vector. If the interaction between the Er and Tb is relatively weak as mentioned above, the interaction between the same kinds of ions will determine the T_{N} variation. The Tb-rich side of Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C will follow the DG expectation as in Y1-_x_TbNi2B2C. On the other hand, the T_{N} values in the Er-rich side of Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C will move toward the one of ErNi2B2C, which is higher than the DG expectation probably due to microscopic magnetic anisotropy.

The weak ferromagnetic temperatures T_{F} can be also accounted for in the two different regions, i.e., Er-rich and Tb-rich regions. The T_{F} in the Er-rich region is almost constant at T >= 2 K, which is same as the one for ErNi2B2C.[3] The T_{F} in the Tb-rich region moves around T = 8 ~ 10 K with increasing Tb concentration. The two different natures of weak ferromagnetic state are manifested themselves in the magnetization data at low temperatures as seen in Figs. 2 and 3. Because the interaction between the two magnetic sites of Er and Tb is relatively weak, no enhancement of T_{F} in the superconducting state by replacing Er with Tb elements is observed in the Er-rich side of the Er1-_x_TbNi2B2C system. For the Tb-rich side of the same samples, the T_{F} jumps to around 9 K, similar to the T_{F} of pure TbNi2B2C.

The normalized superconducting transition temperatures for various samples of single crystals are plotted versus DG values in Fig. 5. As can be seen, the normalized _T__c_'s are not on a universal curve for the DG scaling. This means that each magnetic element has a different magnetic strength as a superconducting pair breaker. This fact is probably due to the magnetic anisotropy caused by the crystalline electric-field (CEF) effect and due to the microscopic magnetic interaction, leading to the different magnetic structures below T_{N}. Because the Gd ion is free from the CEF effect and, consequently, shows an isotropic three-dimensional magnetic nature, the data of the Y1-_x_GdNi2B2C system can be considered as a universal one based on the AG theory.[14] Other magnetic elements, such as Er, Ho, Tb, Dy, which show a two-dimensional magnetic state, exhibit less effective pair breaking than Gd. It is obvious that Er and Tb have similar effects on the superconductivity. It is quite interesting to notice that the ground-state magnetic structures of the both ErNi2B2C and TbNi2B2C below T_{N} consist of AF layers perpendicular to the c axis and the ones of the both HoNi2B2C and DyNi2B2C of alternating ferromagnetic layers.[2] The difference of ErNi2B2C and TbNi2B2C is in the direction of modulation vector of the magnetic moments,

Er1−_x_TbNi2B2C: this work; Y1−_x_TbNi2B2C: Ref. [14]; Ho1−_x_Dy3Ni2B2C: Ref. [14]; and ErNi2B2C: Ref. [3].

  which is perpendicular to the AF ordering axis in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C and parallel to the AF ordering axis in TbNi_{2}B_{2}C. Therefore it seems that the anisotropic magnetic interaction within the ordering plane even above T_{N} has a clear effect on the strength of magnetic pair breaking.

As mentioned above, the T_{c}'s for T_{c}<T_{N} in Er_{1-x}Tb_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C follow AG expectation while the ones in Ho_{1-x}Dy_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C are independent of the DG factor. Recently, the abnormal behavior of the T_{c} of Ho_{1-x}Dy_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C for T_{c}<T_{N} is explained in terms of the cancellation of effective magnetic field at the Ni site by considering the symmetry of magnetic structure below T_{N}.[15] This phenomenological model is suitable in the Ho_{1-x}Dy_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C system because the two compounds of HoNi_{2}B_{2}C and DyNi_{2}B_{2}C have exactly same magnetic ground structures. However, this model cannot be applied to the Er_{1-x}Tb_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C system, studied in this paper, because the two compounds of ErNi_{2}B_{2}C and TbNi_{2}B_{2}C have different magnetic modulation vectors, resulting in no perfect cancellation of the effective magnetic field at Ni site. This behavior is also consistent with the fact that the magnetic interaction between Er and Tb is relatively weak.

## IV Conclusion

The series of Er_{1-x}Tb_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C compounds exhibits variety of magnetism, superconductivity, which were seen in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C and TbNi_{2}B_{2}C, and the interplay between them. The T_{c} of ErNi_{2}B_{2}C is suppressed by adding a Tb element and a crossover for T_{c}<T_{N} occurs at x= 0.2. The T_{c} variation follows well the DG scaling down to T_{c}\approx2 K and x= 0.3 contrary to Ho_{1-x}Dy_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C. From the T_{c} variation, it is conjectured that the magnetic pair breaking strength of Tb in RNi_{2}B_{2}C compounds is comparable with Er probably because of the similar magnetic interaction, leading to the compensated magnetic layer perpendicular to the c axis below T_{N}. However, the difference in terms of the modulation vectors is likely to cause a weak interaction between the Er and Tb in Er_{1-x}Tb_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C, leading to distinct T_{N} and T_{WF} variation with the DG values in Er- and Tb-rich compounds. This means that the observed magnetic subtle effects should be included to make microscopic corrections in the AG theory and magnetic interactions.
