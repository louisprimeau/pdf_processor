###### Abstract

In an experiment in a diamond anvil cell utilizing helium pressure medium, yttrium metal displays a superconducting transition temperature which increases monotonically from \(T_{c}\) = 3.5 K at 30 GPa to 17 K at 89.3 GPa, one of the highest transition temperatures for any elemental superconductor. The pressure dependence of \(T_{c}\) differs substantially from that observed in previous studies under quasibidrostatic pressure to 30 GPa. Remarkably, the dependence of \(T_{c}\) on relative volume \(V/V_{o}\) is nearly linear over the entire pressure range above 33 GPa, implying that higher values of \(T_{c}\) are likely at higher pressures. For the trivalent metals Sc, Y, La, and Lu, there appears to be some correlation between \(T_{c}\) and the ratio \(r_{a}/r_{c}\) of the Wigner-Seitz radius to the ion core radius.

Before the advent of high-temperature superconductivity in 1986, the highest known values of the superconducting transition temperature were exhibited by the binary A-15 compounds V\({}_{3}\)Si, Nb\({}_{5}\)Sn and Nb\({}_{3}\)Ge with \(T_{c}\)'s in the range 17\(-\)23 K.1 With the discovery in 2001 of superconductivity in MgB\({}_{2}\), the highest value of \(T_{c}\) for a binary compound was extended to 40 K.2 For elemental superconductors, on the other hand, the maximum value of \(T_{c}\) at ambient pressure is only 9.5 K for Nb. Under high pressure conditions, however, the number of elemental superconductors not only increases from 29 to 52,3-5 but the transition temperatures for a number of elements (Li, P, S, Ca, V, and La) reach values in the range of 13\(-\)20 K formerly "reserved" for the A-15 compounds.6

In this paper, we focus our attention on the four closely related \(d\)-band metals--Sc, Y, La, and Lu--which share the trivalent valence electron configuration \(nd^{1}(n\!+\!1)s^{2}\), where \(n\!=\!3\), 4, or 5. Whereas La is superconducting at ambient pressure, Sc, Y, and Lu only superconductor under high pressure, all four elements exhibiting a positive pressure derivative \(dT_{c}/dP\!>\!0\).7-10 Some light on the origin of these and other interesting results was shed by the observation of Johansson and Rosengren11 in 1975 that the ratio of the Wigner-Seitz radius to ionic radius, \(r_{a}/r_{c}\), appears to play an important role in determining the pressure dependence of the superconducting properties of Y, La, Lu and La-Y, La-Lu alloys as well as the equilibrium crystal structure sequence [hexagonal close packed (hcp) \(\rightarrow\) Sm-type \(\rightarrow\) dhep \(\rightarrow\) face centered cubic (fcc)] across the rare-earth series. Duthie and Petitor12 subsequently demonstrated that these and other important correlations are a consequence of the fact that the ratio \(r_{a}/r_{c}\) is inversely related to the \(d\)-band occupancy \(n_{d}\), a quantity which in general increases under pressure due to \(s\)\(\rightarrow\)\(d\) transfer. Later studies show that yttrium metal follows the structure sequence (hcp \(\rightarrow\) Sm-type \(\rightarrow\) dhep \(\rightarrow\) trigonal) as the applied pressure is increased to 50 GPa at ambient temperature.13,14 Melsen _et al._15 have predicted that at pressures above 280 GPa yttrium should transform into the body-centered-cubic structure. It would be of great interest to extend the above superconductivity/structural experiments to much higher pressures to allow a critical assessment of possible correlations with the ratio \(r_{a}/r_{c}\) over a wide range of parameters.

Yttrium metal does not superconduct above 6 mK at ambient pressure.7 However, in 1970 Wittig16 discovered superconductivity in Y at \(T_{c}\!=\!1.3\) K under 11 GPa quasihydrostatic pressure (solid steatite pressure medium); \(T_{c}\) increased monotonically with pressure at the rate \(dT_{c}/d\dot{P}\)\(\simeq\!+0.35\) K GPa\({}^{-1}\), finally reaching 9 K at 30 GPa. In the present paper, we extend these earlier studies to much higher pressures; we also provide for a nearly hydrostatic pressure environment by using dense helium as pressure medium. We find that \(T_{c}\) indeed increases monotonically with pressure, ultimately reaching 17 K at 89.3 GPa. This is one of the highest values of \(T_{c}\) ever observed for an elemental superconductor; values above 20 K appear likely at higher pressures. Comparing the pressure dependences for Y, Lu, La, and Sc, the simple inverse relation between \(T_{c}\) and the ratio \(r_{a}/r_{c}\) proposed by Johansson and Rosengren11 is found to extend to much higher pressures.

High pressures were generated using a diamond anvil cell (DAC) made of CuBe alloy, nonmagnetic CuBe being used in the critical region near the sample.17 Two opposing 1/6-carat type IIa diamond anvils with 0.3 mm diameter culet and 3 mm table were used. A miniature Y sample was cut from an ingot (Aldrich Chemical 99.9%) to approximate dimensions 60\(\times\)60\(\times\)20 \(\mu\)m\({}^{3}\) and placed in a 150 \(\mu\)m diameter hole electrospray drilled through the center of a 3 mm diameter \(\times\)250 \(\mu\)m thick gold-plated rheonium or NiCrAl-alloy gasket preindented to 50 \(\mu\)m (see Fig. 1 in Ref. 18). The rheonium gasket used in experimental runs \(A\) and \(B\) becomes superconducting near 3.5 K under pressure,18,19 thus allowing the detection of the superconducting signal from the Y sample only for \(T_{c}\!\geq\!4\) K. For this reason, a non-superconducting gasket made of NiCrAl alloy was used in run \(C\).

Tiny ruby spheres20 allow the determination21 of the pressure _in situ_ with resolution \(\pm\)0.2 GPa at 20 K. For the results shown here, the standard ruby calibration in Ref. 21 was used to facilitate comparison with previous work. However, we point out that Holzapfel22 has very recently published a revised ruby pressure calibration to 300 GPa which deviates by 5% or more from the previous calibration [21] in the pressure range above 60 GPa. According to this revised ruby scale, our highest pressure should be corrected upward from 89.3 GPa to 96 GPa, but the basic conclusions reached in this paper remain unaffected.

At the beginning of the experiment, the gasket hole is filled with superfluid liquid helium at temperatures below 2 K before sealing it shut by pressing the opposing diamond anvils further into the preindented gasket. Pressure is changed in the temperature range 150\(-\)180 K. To reduce the chance of helium penetration into the diamond anvils, the DAC was kept at temperatures below 180 K during the entire duration (\(\sim\)10 days) of each of the three experimental runs.

The superconducting transition is determined inductively using two balanced primary/secondary coil systems located immediately outside the metal gasket and connected to a Stanford Research SR830 digital lock-in amplifier. The ac susceptibility studies were carried out using a 3 G root-mean-square magnetic field at 1023 Hz. As seen in Fig. 1 for the data in run \(B\), the real part of the ac susceptibility signal changes abruptly by 1\(-\)2 mV at the superconducting transition. The relatively low noise level (\(\sim\)0.2 mV) is achieved by appropriate signal compensation and impedance matching as well as through both the use of a long time constant (30 s) on the lock-in amplifier during very slow (100 mK/min) temperature sweeps and the averaging of multiple measurements. Further experimental details of the DAC and ac susceptibility techniques are published elsewhere. [17, 23]

In Fig. 2, the value of \(T_{c}\) from the transition midpoint is plotted versus pressure for all three experimental runs, revealing excellent agreement. Normally \(T_{c}\) is measured for increasing pressure; however, at the end of run \(A\) the pressure was reduced from 48 to 38 GPa (open red circle), demonstrating the reversibility of the pressure dependence \(T_{c}(P)\), at least in this pressure range. The present results, which were obtained under nearly hydrostatic pressure conditions, are seen to differ significantly from those obtained earlier for \(P\) \(\leq\) 30 GPa under quasihydrostatic pressure conditions where the solid stectite was used as pressure medium; [9, 16] at 25 GPa, for example, \(T_{c}\) \(\simeq\) 7 K in the quasihydrostatic measurements, whereas \(T_{c}\) \(<\) 4 K in the present study. Abrupt changes in the slope \(dT_{c}/dP\) near 12 and 25 GPa in the quasihydrostatic data, and at 30\(-\)35 GPa in the present data, may be related to the structural transitions reported near 15 GPa (hcp \(\rightarrow\) Sm-type) and 30 GPa (Sm-type \(\rightarrow\) dthep) at ambient temperature. [13, 14] Note that these phase boundaries may shift upon cooling from ambient to low temperatures.

In Fig. 3, we replot the present results from Fig. 2 as \(T_{c}\) versus relative volume \(V/V_{o}\) using the equation of state for Y determined by Grosshans and Holzapfel. [14] Remarkably, over the entire pressure range 33 to 89.3 GPa, \(T_{c}\) is seen to be a nearly linear function of the sample volume \(V\). Extending the straight-line fit to higher pressures, the transition temperature \(T_{c}\) would reach values of 20, 25, or 30 K for \(P\) \(\approx\) 130, 250, or 540 GPa, respectively. The data in Fig. 3, however, can be somewhat more accurately fit by a quadratic expression with a small positive curvature (dashed line) or by two straight lines (not shown) with slightly different slopes which intersect at \(V/V_{o}\) \(\simeq\) 0.55 (\(\sim\)53 GPa). One could speculate that such a slope change might be related to the dthep\(\rightarrow\)trigonal transition seen in structural studies on Y. [13, 14]

We now explore in Fig. 4 whether the observed increase

Figure 2: (Color online) Symbols give superconducting transition temperature of yttrium metal versus nearly hydrostatic (dense helium) pressure to 89.3 GPa in present experiments. Error bars give transition widths. Data (runs \(A,B,C\)) taken with increasing pressure except for final point (open red circle) in run \(A\). Vertical arrows for \(P\) \(<\) 30 GPa indicate the absence of superconductivity above lowest temperature measured (4 K in run \(A\) or 2 K in run _C_). Solid lines give \(T_{c}(P)\) under quasihydrostatic pressure to 16 GPa (from Ref. [16]) and to 30 GPa (from Ref. [7]).

Figure 1: Real part of the ac susceptibility signal in anavolts versus temperature for yttrium metal at 14 different pressures from 33 to 89.3 GPa (run _B_). The applied ac field is 3 G (rms) at 1023 Hz. Data at different pressures are shifted vertically for clarity. The 1\(-\)2 nV jump in the ac susceptibility marks the superconducting transition at \(T_{c}\). As the pressure increases, \(T_{c}\) is seen to increase monotonically.

  in \(T_{c}\) with pressure for the four trivalent elements Sc, Y, La, and Lu is correlated with the ratio \(r_{a}/r_{c}\) as originally proposed by Johansson and Rosengren,[11] where \(r_{a}\) = \(\sqrt[3]{(3/4\,\pi)V_{a}(P)}\), \(V_{a}(P)\) is the volume per atom at the given pressure,[14, 24] and the ionic radius \(r_{c}\) (Ref. [24]) is assumed independent of pressure. In examining the data in Fig. 4, one should keep in mind that the results of quasihydrostatic pressure studies (solid, dotted, or dashed lines) are included together with those of the present nearly hydrostatic studies (symbols). The fact that the two very different pressure environments can have a strong influence on the measured \(T_{c}(P)\) dependences is evident from the results on Y in Fig. 2. In addition, the results on La of Tissen _et al.[10]_ in Fig. 4 using methanol-ethanol pressure medium differ from the earlier, less hydrostatic studies.[9]

In spite of these caveats, two simple systematics are evident in Fig. 4. First, the three nonsuperconducting metals Y, Lu, and Sc become superconducting if high pressure is applied, \(T_{c}\) generally increasing with pressure (decreasing ratio \(r_{a}/r_{c}\)) for all four metals. Second, the value of \(T_{c}\) does not increase above 1 K unless the applied pressure is sufficient to bring the ratio down to values below \(r_{a}/r_{c}\) = 2.1. For La at ambient pressure, the ratio \(r_{a}/r_{c}\) is clearly less than 2.1; this is consistent with the fact that La's dhcp phase is superconducting at \(T_{c}\) = 5 K and its fcc phase at 6 K. It would be interesting to investigate possible correlations between \(T_{c}\) and the ratio \(r_{a}/r_{c}\) for Sc, Y, La, and Lu to nearly hydrostatic (dense He) pressures well above 100 GPa (1 Mbar) and, in particular, to determine for what value of \(r_{a}/r_{c}\) the transition temperature \(T_{c}\) passes through its maximum value \(T_{c}^{\rm max}\). The value of \(T_{c}^{\rm max}\), and the pressure (or ratio \(r_{a}/r_{c}\)) at which it occurs, may depend on the degree of hydrostaticity of the pressure medium used.

The value of the superconducting transition temperature found here for Y under 89.3 GPa nearly hydrostatic (dense He) pressure, \(T_{c}\) = 17 K from the midpoint of the magnetic susceptibility transition, is among the highest ever reported for an elemental superconductor. Using the same susceptibility-midpoint criterion, Ishizuka _et al.[25]_ report that \(T_{c}\) = 16.5 K for vanadium under 120 GPa nonhydrostatic pressure (no pressure medium), with a superconducting onset at 17.2 K. The superconducting onset in the susceptibility of sulfur passes through a maximum value of 17 K near 200 GPa nonhydrostatic pressure.[26] Values of \(T_{c}\) \(\approx\) 18 K (30 GPa) and 20 K (48 GPa) have been, respectively, reported for P and Li from their resistivity onsets by Shirotani _et al.[27]_ and Shimizu _et al.[28]_ for nonhydrostatic pressure; however, it is well known that the temperature of the resistivity onset may lie significantly higher than the bulk value of \(T_{c}\).[29] Subsequent magnetic susceptibility experiments on Li report \(T_{c}^{\rm max}\) = 16 K (transition onset) at 33 GPa (Ref. [30]) and \(T_{c}^{\rm max}\) = 14 K (transition midpoint) at 30 GPa.[18] Clearly, the value of \(T_{c}\) depends to some extent on the measurement technique and \(T_{c}\)-criterion used. In any case, the highest reported values of \(T_{c}\) for elemental superconductors under extreme pressure lie near 17 K. It is interesting to note that for the elements Ca,[31], Y, Lu,\({}^{7}\) Sc,[8] V,[25] B,[32] and P,[27] the transition temperature \(T_{c}\) is still climbing for the highest pressures thus far reached. It is very likely that in the near future the transition temperature of one of these elemental superconductors will surpass the \(T_{c}\) = 20 K barrier under extreme pressures.

To our knowledge, no electronic structure calculation of \(T_{c}\) has yet been carried out for Y at reduced lattice parameters. Such a calculation for V to 945 GPa is in quite good agreement with the experimental results to 120 GPa and

[7]) and Sc (Ref. [8]) (solid lines), on La (Ref. [9]) and Lu (Ref. [7]) (dashed lines), and on La (from Ref. [10]) (dot-dashed lines). At ambient pressure the value of the ratio \(r_{a}/r_{c}\) is: Y (2.21), Lu (2.23), Sc (2.45), and La (2.08) (Ref. [24]).

Figure 3: (Color online) Results of present experiments in Fig. 2 replotted as \(T_{c}\) vs relative volume \(V/V_{a}\) using equation of state (from Ref. [14]). Straight line is: \(T_{c}\)(K) = 43.8–59.3(\(V/V_{a}\)); dashed line with slight positive curvature is: \(T_{c}\)(K) = 66.1–141(\(V/V_{a}\)) + 73.6(\(V/V_{a}\))\({}^{2}\).

  predicts that \(T_{c}\) should pass through a maximum value of 21 K at 139 GPa.[33] In view of the nearly linear dependence of \(T_{c}\) on \(V/V_{o}\) to the highest pressure (see Fig. 3), it would be of particular interest to carry out a similar calculation for Y.

_Note added in proof._ We have very recently extended the pressure range of our studies on Y metal to approximately 115 GPa (1.15 Mbar) giving \(T_{c}\)=19.5 K (midpoint) and 20.0 K (onset). To our knowledge, this is the highest transition temperature ever measured in the magnetic susceptibility for an elemental superconductor, equaling the value of \(T_{c}\) reported in Ref. [28] for Li from the resistivity onset.
