###### Abstract

Pair-breaking effects induced by 3-MeV proton irradiations are examined in underdoped, optimally doped, and overdoped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} single crystals in terms of suppression of the superconducting critical temperature T_{c}. The small residual resistivity (RR) in as-grown crystals shows the presence of negligible intrinsic scatterings, which makes this material a model system for studying the effect of artificially introduced scatterings. The RR and T_{c} change linearly with the proton dose. As in the case of proton irradiation in Co-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}, we do not detect any low-temperature upturns in resistivity attributable to magnetic scattering or localization. Regardless of K doping levels, the critical value of the normalized scattering rate is much higher than that expected in \varepsilon_{\pm}-wave superconductors.

## I Introduction

The superconducting gap structure and the underlying pairing mechanism of iron-based superconductors (IBSs) are under intense debate. Nevertheless, no consensus has been established. At a very early stage, it was claimed that the superconductivity in IBSs was mediated by antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations, leading to the so-called s_{\pm}-wave gap structure.[1, 2] Namely, the opposite sign of the order parameter between hole and electron Fermi surfaces (FSs) is realized via interband scatterings between hole and electron FSs. However, another perspective has been proposed that the orbital degrees of freedom play an important role in various physical properties. The superconductivity mediated by orbital fluctuations has a gap function of s_{++}-wave without sign reversal.[3, 4] Some experimental results such as ultrasonic measurement support the importance of the orbital degrees of freedom.[5, 6] In optimally K-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}, laser angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurement provides results of the same magnitude of the superconducting gap on different hole FSs, which is difficult to explain by only the spin-fluctuation scenario.[7] Moreover, a FS-selective gap structure including octet line nodes in the end member of the series KFe_{2}As_{2} implies that several pairing mechanisms are competing, namely, spin and orbital fluctuations.[8]

To go forward with the identification of the pairing mechanism of IBSs, a phase-sensitive probe is required. The impurity effects have played a key role for this purpose since the study of cuprate superconductors.[9] According to Anderson's theorem, nonmagnetic impurities do not work as a pair breaker in isotropic single-gap superconductors. By contrast, fast suppression of the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} is expected in superconductors with a sign change such as d wave, analogous to magnetic impurities in s-wave superconductors. In fact, this has been observed in cuprate superconductors, such as Zn-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} and Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8}.[9] In IBSs, pioneering studies have been reported.[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] A peculiar way to introduce disorders is energetic particle irradiation. Defects created by 2.5-MeV electron irradiation are reported to behave similarly to Zn substitutions in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Ref. [19]). In sharp contrast to chemical substitution, light-particle irradiations enable us to systematically introduce pointlike defects in a given sample. The problems in chemical substitution, like structurally unstable and inhomogeneous properties and/or possible changes in carrier density and FS topology, can be also overcome. Such advantages are utilized to single crystalline IBSs to distinguish whether the gap has sign reversal or not. The most striking result obtained is in proton (H^{+}) irradiated Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2}, which shows a depression of superconductivity slower than that expected for s_{\pm}-wave superconductors.[15]

Among several types of IBSs, BaFe_{2}As_{2} is the prototypical system. Especially, optimally and over K-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} have very small residual resistivity (RR), so that the intrinsic impurity scattering is negligible.[20] This is in stark contrast to the Co-doped sample, where direct doping of Fe-site provides a large RR (\sim50 \mu\Omega cm at optimal doping) even after BaAs annealing.[20, 21] Owing to the absence of the intrinsic scattering centers, we can safely attribute RR to extrinsically introduced scattering, which have a possibility of pair breaking.

In this paper, we report the suppression rate of T_{c} in underdoped, optimally doped, and overdoped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} (x = 0.23, 0.42, and 0.69) by 3-MeV proton (H^{+}) irradiation. The parallel shift without low-temperature upturn evidences the introduction of nonmagnetic impurity. The rate of T_{c} suppression is much weaker than that expected for s_{\pm}-wave superconductors, as in the case of Co-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}.

## II Experimental Methods

Single crystals of underdoped and optimally K-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} were grown by FeAs self-flux method, whereas overdoped single crystals were synthesized by using other flux.[22] The actual K-doping level was determined by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The resultant x of Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} was 0.23, 0.42, and 0.69 for underdoped, optimally doped, and overdoped crystals, respectively. All crystals were cleaved to be thin plates with thickness less than \sim25 \mum. This value is much smaller than the projected range of 3-MeV H^{+} for Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} of \sim50 \mum, calculated by the stopping and range of ions in matter-2008.[23] Gold  wires were attached to the samples by silver paste with a standard four-probe configuration for _in situ_ resistivity measurements. After they were loaded onto the sapphire plate, these crystals were cooled down by a closed-cycle refrigerator at the terminal of the irradiation port. The 3-MeV H^{+} irradiation at T=50 K was performed parallel to the c axis at NIRS-HIMAC. Since random point defects including Frenkel pairs, some of which are mobile even at room T (Ref. [24]), are expected to be produced by 3-MeV H^{+} irradiation,[25] we kept the temperature low (\leqslant50 K) to stabilize defects during the following resistance measurements. The proton flux was limited to \lesssim10^{12} ions/cm^{2}/s to avoid excessive heating of the crystals. The magneto-optical imaging was performed by using the local-field-dependent Faraday effect in the in-plane magnetized garnet indicator film employing a differential method.[26, 27]

## III Results and discussion

To ensure the quality of the samples, we have measured the resistivity (\rho) in a wide range of temperature (T). Figure 1 represents the result of \rho-T measurements in the as-grown samples, which are identical to those used in the irradiation study in the following. The absolute value of \rho at T=300 K is slightly reduced with increasing x. Upon cooling, the crossover from high-T convex to low-T concave behavior is observed at the characteristic T^{*}\simeq 100 K. These results are quite consistent with the previous reports.[20, 28] In the low-T region T\ll T^{*}, a quadratic T dependence of \rho is observed in all three samples, which is obvious in the inset of Fig. 1. The superconducting transition occurs at T_{c}=24.4 K, 37.4 K, and 17.8 K, in x=0.23, 0.42, and 0.69, respectively, where T_{c} is defined by the midpoint of resistive transition. These values of T_{c} almost coincide with the onset of the Meissner signal measured by the superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer, which gives evidence for the bulk transition.

The central issue of this study is to clarify the relationship between the evolution of \rho_{0} and the reduction of T_{c}, where \rho_{0} is the residual resistivity. For this purpose, we have employed _in situ_ resistance measurements right after the introduction of scattering centers. The \rho-T measurements after the H^{+} irradiation up to a dose of 9.2\times 10^{16} ions/cm^{2} are illustrated in Fig. 2. Regarding the normal state behavior, all samples show a parallel shift upon irradiation without any low-T upturn, indicating that the point defects introduced by this irradiation are nonmagnetic and no localization effects appear. This fact is quite important in view of the study of pair-breaking effects, since the stiffness of the superconductivity to the nonmagnetic scattering is the key to distinguish the possible sign-reversing order parameter. To estimate the impurity scattering rate, we have extrapolated \rho in the normal state to T=0 K with a function of \rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{2} and calculated \Delta\rho_{0}\equiv\rho_{0}^{i}-\rho_{0}^{0}, where \rho_{0}^{i} is \rho_{0} of the ith irradiation. The evolutions of \Delta\rho_{0} with the dose are depicted in Fig. 3(a). An almost linear increase in \Delta\rho_{0} is evident in all samples, although the slope of the underdoped sample is twice as large as the slopes in the optimally doped and overdoped samples. On the other hand, we can see that T_{c} is gradually suppressed without significant broadening of the transition in all samples except for the tail part. We will come back to this point later. We define T_{c} by the midpoint of a sharp \rho drop, so that T_{c} as a function of the dose is shown in Fig. 3(b). Here the error bars are twice T_{c}^{\rm onset}-T_{c} (T_{c}^{\rm onset} is the onset T of the \rho drop), which is smaller than \sim1 K, except for underdoped sample at higher doses. T_{c} suppression, \Delta T_{c}=T_{c0}-T_{c}, is linear with a maximum reduction of 4.3, 3.0, and 4.3 K, for underdoped, optimally doped, and overdoped samples, respectively, where T_{c0} is T_{c} before the irradiation. It should be noted that this suppression of T_{c} is much larger than that reported for heavy-ion irradiated (Ba,K)Fe_{2}As_{2} with a matching field of 21 T (\Delta T_{c}\sim 0.3 K), where the average spacing of columnar defects is 100 A(Ref. [29]).

Figure 4 represents T_{c} (main panel) and T_{c}/T_{c0} (inset) as a function of \Delta\rho_{0}. The suppression rates of T_{c}, -\Delta T_{c}/\Delta\rho_{0}, are 65 K/m\Omega cm, 95 K/m\Omega cm, and 161 K/m\Omega cm for x=0.23, 0.42, and 0.69, respectively. It is noteworthy that these values are comparable to the value of 46-77 K/m\Omega cm in chemically substituted Ba_{0.5}K_{0.5}Fe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [17]). The linear extrapolation, drawn by broken lines in Fig. 4, gives the critical residual resistivity value \Delta\rho_{0}^{\rm cr} to fully suppress T_{c} as 376,

  396, and 110 \mu\Omega cm, respectively. These values of \Delta\rho_{0}^{\rm cr} for the underdoped and optimally doped samples are similar to previous reports (100-1000 \mu\Omega cm) [14, 15, 16, 17] and consistent with theoretical study.[3] The overdoped sample, on the other hand, has a smaller \Delta\rho_{0}^{\rm cr}. The fast suppression rate of T_{c} in the overdoped sample can be seen even in the T_{c}/T_{c0} vs \Delta\rho_{0}, depicted in the inset of Fig. 4. The slope in the overdoped sample is 3.5 times larger than the slopes of the underdoped and optimally doped samples.

For quantitative discussion of pair-breaking effects by nonmagnetic scatterings, we evaluate the normalized scattering rate g=\hbar/2\pi k_{B}T_{c0}\tau, where \hbar, k_{B}, and \tau are the Planck's constant divided by 2\pi, the Boltzmann constant, and the scattering time, respectively. If we assume the intraband scattering rate \tau_{\rm intra}^{-1} and the interband scattering rate \tau_{\rm inter}^{-1} are the same, i.e., \tau_{\rm intra}^{-1}\simeq\tau_{\rm inter}^{-1}\equiv\tau^{-1}, then 1/\Delta\rho_{0}=1/\Delta\rho_{\rm intra}+1/\Delta\rho_{\rm intra}=(ne^{2}/m^ {*})(\tau_{\rm intra}+\tau_{\rm inter})=2ne^{2}/m^{*}\tau^{-1}, and we can estimate \tau^{-1} from \Delta\rho_{0} as \tau^{-1}=2ne^{2}\Delta\rho_{0}/m^{*}, where n is the carrier density, e is the elementary charge, and m^{*} is the effective quasiparticle mass. In the following, we show three different estimations of g: g^{\rm 5oth}, g^{\rm 3}, and g^{H}, which are described in Figs. 5(a), 5(b), and 5(c), respectively.

According to linear response theory based on the five-orbital model, we obtain the relation \Delta\rho_{0} (\mu\Omega cm) = 0.18\tau^{-1} (K) in Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}, leading to the first estimation of g^{\rm 5oth}=0.882\Delta\rho_{0}/T_{c0}, where z is the renormalization factor.[30] The angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurement in Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2} gives a result of the renormalization factor z=1/2 (Refs. [31] and [32]). The obtained T_{c}/T_{c0} as a function of g^{\rm 5oth} is shown in Fig. 5(a). The critical values of g(\equiv g_{c}) where the linear extrapolation of T_{c}/T_{c0} goes to zero are evaluated as 6.8, 4.7, and 2.7 in x=0.23, 0.42, and 0.69, respectively. These values compare well with those obtained for substitutions of Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn for Fe in almost optimally doped crystals of Ba_{0.5}K_{0.5}Fe_{2}As_{2}, g_{c}=4-8.[17]

With London penetration depth \lambda=\sqrt{m^{*}/\mu_{0}ne^{2}}, we can obtain another estimation of \tau^{-1} as \tau^{-1}=ne^{2}\Delta\rho_{0}/m^{*}=\Delta\rho_{0}/\mu_{0}\omega^{2}, where \mu_{0} is the vacuum permeability. It is noted that the use of \lambda allows us to avoid direct estimation of n and m^{*}. Optical measurements in the low-frequency limit give \lambda\simeq 2000 A in Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [33]). Without considering the K doping dependence of \lambda, we obtain the second estimation g^{\lambda}=\hbar\Delta\rho_{0}/\pi k_{B}T_{c0}\mu_{0}\lambda^{2}. T_{c}/T_{c0} as a function of g^{\lambda} is shown in Fig. 5(b). The critical values g_{c} of the normalized scattering rate obtained from linear extrapolations are 7.5, 5.1, and 3.0 in x=0.23, 0.42, and 0.69, respectively.

The conventional approach to estimate carrier density n is from Hall coefficient R_{H} measurements. R_{H} at 300 K is reported to be \sim1 \times 10^{-9} m^{3}/C (Refs. [28, 34], which offers the third estimation of g^{H}=\hbar\Delta\rho_{0}e/\pi k_{B}T_{c0}m^{*}R_{H}. With the mass enhancement factor m^{*}=2m as mentioned above, the critical scattering rates g_{c} for x=0.23, 0.42, and 0.69 are estimated as g_{c}=33, 23, and 13, respectively. Here m is assumed to be the free electron mass. These values are more than 4 times larger than the other estimations above. This is possibly because R_{H} is not a good measure of n in Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}, since the T variation of R_{H} is ascribed to several contributions such as multiband nature, antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, Fermi surface reconstruction, and so on. Unfortunately, it is difficult to separate these contributions from others. For example, Ohgushi and Kiuchi analyzed R_{H} in Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} assuming a two-band model with an expression of hole carrier density n_{h}=n_{0}+\frac{x}{2}\frac{m_{n}}{m_{n}+m_{e}} and electron carrier density n_{e}=n_{0}-\frac{x}{2}\frac{m_{e}}{m_{n}+m_{e}} and found a strong T dependence of n_{0} and m_{h}/m_{e} (Ref. [28]). This means that the estimation of g^{H} largely depends on the choice of T in  R_{H}. In addition, we cannot use R_{H} at low T since an apparent spin-fluctuation effect is identified as evidenced by a strong T dependence of R_{H}, especially in underdoped samples. Thus g^{H} must overestimate the scattering rate.

These three results should be compared with the s_{\pm}-wave scenario with equal gap magnitudes of opposite signs on different FSs. Provided the simplest assumption of \tau_{\rm intra}^{-1}=\tau_{\rm inter}^{-1}, the pair breaking is evaluated by the Abrikosov-Gory'kov formula, -\ln T_{c}/T_{c0}=\psi(1/2+gT_{c0}/2T_{c})-\psi(1/2), where \psi(x) is a diagramma function and g=\hbar\tau_{\rm inter}^{-1}/2\pi k_{B}T_{c0}. The obtained critical g in this scenario is g_{c}^{\pm}\simeq 0.3, as shown in Figs. 5(a)-5(c). Obviously, all estimates of g_{c} are much larger than g_{c}^{\pm}\simeq 0.3. By contrast, it is expected that the rate of T_{c} suppression is much smaller in the s_{++}-wave scenario. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that the realization of the s_{\pm}-wave gap function in K-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} is unlikely. However, it should be noted that an impurity-robust s_{\pm} state has recently been discussed by changing the ratio of inter- to intraband scatterings.[36, 37] To examine if the anomalously small ratio of inter- to intraband scattering is feasible, Yamakawa _et al.[38]_ have recently studied the nonlocal impurity scattering effect in accordance with the first-principle study deriving 3d- and 4d-impurity potentials.[39] They have found that the negligible interband scattering is unrealistic and -\Delta T_{c}/\Delta\rho_{0} is independent of the impurity potential strength and T_{c0}. They concluded that the s_{\pm}-wave state is inconsistent with the experimental results reported in IBSs, which is consistent with the local impurity model in Ref. [4]. The results obtained in Refs. [3, 36, 37, and 40, 41, 42, 43, 44] are based on orbital-less multiband model. In this model, the amplitude of interband scattering becomes negligible in a unitary impurity scattering regime. This is why a wide range of ratios of intra- to interband scatterings is examined, and at a small interband scattering rate the superconductivity is robust even in the s_{\pm}-wave state. However, this model neglects the momentum dependence of the impurity potential originated from the orbital degrees of freedom. When taking it into account, i.e., based on the five-orbital model, it is revealed that a large interband scattering should appear and the s_{\pm} state is fragile. Hence, we must adopt the comparable interband scattering to the intraband one. Although we cannot specify the ratio of inter- to intraband scattering rates, the ratio is not completely an arbitrary assumption. Our present results manifest the robustness of T_{c} against the introduction of impurity scatterings, and based on the above consideration, we can safely conclude that they are inconsistent with the s_{\pm}-wave state in the Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} system. We should additionally point out that faster suppression of T_{c}/T_{c0} in highly overdoped samples is possibly realized if the mass enhancement m^{*}/m is large, taking the stronger correlation in the end member of KFe_{2}As_{2} into account.[45, 46] The disappearance of the electron FS sheets and the negligible gap size of the outer hole FS are reported for x\geq 0.6, leading to possible crossover of the superconducting order parameter, caused by the competition between the pairing mechanisms, probably the orbital fluctuation and the spin fluctuation.[47, 48] The observed faster suppression of T_{c}/T_{c0} in the x=0.69 sample might be related to such differences.

Here we stress the advantage of K-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} to discuss impurity effects. As already mentioned above, the as-grown K-doped system has no intrinsic impurity scattering, i.e., negligible RR, so we can discuss all the above by means of \rho_{0} instead of \Delta\rho_{0}. This enables us to make a straightforward transformation from the RR to the impurity scattering rate.

  Even if we do so, the obtained results are almost the same because of very small \rho_{0}^{0}. This point gives a significant advantage compared with the Co-doped system, where we can understand the origin of the increment \Delta\rho_{0} only but not clearly of \rho_{0}^{0}. Once we are able to obtain high-quality single crystals of K-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}, the study in this sample is more suitable than that in the Co-doped one to purely testify to the robustness of superconductivity against impurity scattering.

Finally, we comment on the tail of resistive transition. Namely, by increasing the irradiation dose, a finite value of \rho remains after the main superconducting transition followed by the second broad transition at a low T. To clarify the origin, we performed magneto-optical (MO) imaging in a similar crystal of H^{+}-irradiated Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2} [Fig. 6(b)] after carefully removing silver paste and gold wires. Figure 6(a) shows an example of the MO image at T=33 K under H=5 Oe. Under this low-field condition, the superconducting region gives a Meissner response, which shows up as a dark part in the MO image. This is actually observed in most parts of the crystal. Additional dark regions are detected at the very narrow regions just beneath gold wires, surrounded by bright regions, where the superconductivity is weakened or lost. This positional-dependent magnetic response addresses lower T_{c} beneath the silver paste. One of the possible origins for such a stronger suppression of T_{c} is that lower-energy H^{+} ions and/or the secondary electrons generated in the silver paste are more effective in introducing point defects. Hence we conclude that the fast suppression of superconductivity under silver paste accompanied by the spatially modulated T_{c} is the origin of the tail in resistive transition. A close inspection of the \rho-T data in Fig. 2 allows us to roughly estimate (T_{c0}-T_{c}^{\rho=0})/\Delta T_{c}\sim 2 in x=0.23 and 0.42, while \sim3 in x=0.69. Since \Delta T_{c} is proportional to \Delta\rho_{0}, \rho_{0} of the part beneath the silver paste is estimated to be twice as large as that of the bare part in x=0.23 and 0.42, while it is 3 times as large in x=0.69. Here the main transition at T_{c} is attributed to the property of the bare parts and zero resistivity appears at T_{c}^{\rho=0} as a consequence of transition in the region beneath the silver paste. Since the volume beneath the silver paste is much smaller than that of the bare parts, the serial circuit of these parts provides only a small correction to \rho_{0}. Such a few percent enhancement of the RR does not affect the pair-breaking discussion above.

## IV Summary

We have evaluated the impurity effects in underdoped, optimally doped, and overdoped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} single crystals by means of 3-MeV H^{+} irradiation. All samples show a parallel shift of the \rho-T curves by the irradiation, which manifests that defects introduced by the irradiation are nonmagnetic and are not causing localization effects. Almost linear variations of \Delta\rho_{0} and T_{c} as a function of dose are obtained. The critical value of the normalized scattering rate g_{c} is estimated by three different methods. By assuming a realistic condition of similar magnitudes of intra- and interband scattering rates, all obtained g_{c}'s are much larger than g_{c}^{\pm}, inconsistent with the s_{\pm}-wave state in Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}.

###### Abstract

Pair-breaking effects induced by 3-MeV proton irradiations are examined in underdoped, optimally doped, and overdoped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} single crystals in terms of suppression of the superconducting critical temperature T_{c}. The small residual resistivity (RR) in as-grown crystals shows the presence of negligible intrinsic scatterings, which makes this material a model system for studying the effect of artificially introduced scatterings. The RR and T_{c} change linearly with the proton dose. As in the case of proton irradiation in Co-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}, we do not detect any low-temperature upturns in resistivity attributable to magnetic scattering or localization. Regardless of K doping levels, the critical value of the normalized scattering rate is much higher than that expected in \varepsilon_{\pm}-wave superconductors.

## I Introduction

The superconducting gap structure and the underlying pairing mechanism of iron-based superconductors (IBSs) are under intense debate. Nevertheless, no consensus has been established. At a very early stage, it was claimed that the superconductivity in IBSs was mediated by antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations, leading to the so-called s_{\pm}-wave gap structure.[1, 2] Namely, the opposite sign of the order parameter between hole and electron Fermi surfaces (FSs) is realized via interband scatterings between hole and electron FSs. However, another perspective has been proposed that the orbital degrees of freedom play an important role in various physical properties. The superconductivity mediated by orbital fluctuations has a gap function of s_{++}-wave without sign reversal.[3, 4] Some experimental results such as ultrasonic measurement support the importance of the orbital degrees of freedom.[5, 6] In optimally K-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}, laser angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurement provides results of the same magnitude of the superconducting gap on different hole FSs, which is difficult to explain by only the spin-fluctuation scenario.[7] Moreover, a FS-selective gap structure including octet line nodes in the end member of the series KFe_{2}As_{2} implies that several pairing mechanisms are competing, namely, spin and orbital fluctuations.[8]

To go forward with the identification of the pairing mechanism of IBSs, a phase-sensitive probe is required. The impurity effects have played a key role for this purpose since the study of cuprate superconductors.[9] According to Anderson's theorem, nonmagnetic impurities do not work as a pair breaker in isotropic single-gap superconductors. By contrast, fast suppression of the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} is expected in superconductors with a sign change such as d wave, analogous to magnetic impurities in s-wave superconductors. In fact, this has been observed in cuprate superconductors, such as Zn-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} and Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8}.[9] In IBSs, pioneering studies have been reported.[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] A peculiar way to introduce disorders is energetic particle irradiation. Defects created by 2.5-MeV electron irradiation are reported to behave similarly to Zn substitutions in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Ref. [19]). In sharp contrast to chemical substitution, light-particle irradiations enable us to systematically introduce pointlike defects in a given sample. The problems in chemical substitution, like structurally unstable and inhomogeneous properties and/or possible changes in carrier density and FS topology, can be also overcome. Such advantages are utilized to single crystalline IBSs to distinguish whether the gap has sign reversal or not. The most striking result obtained is in proton (H^{+}) irradiated Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2}, which shows a depression of superconductivity slower than that expected for s_{\pm}-wave superconductors.[15]

Among several types of IBSs, BaFe_{2}As_{2} is the prototypical system. Especially, optimally and over K-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} have very small residual resistivity (RR), so that the intrinsic impurity scattering is negligible.[20] This is in stark contrast to the Co-doped sample, where direct doping of Fe-site provides a large RR (\sim50 \mu\Omega cm at optimal doping) even after BaAs annealing.[20, 21] Owing to the absence of the intrinsic scattering centers, we can safely attribute RR to extrinsically introduced scattering, which have a possibility of pair breaking.

In this paper, we report the suppression rate of T_{c} in underdoped, optimally doped, and overdoped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} (x = 0.23, 0.42, and 0.69) by 3-MeV proton (H^{+}) irradiation. The parallel shift without low-temperature upturn evidences the introduction of nonmagnetic impurity. The rate of T_{c} suppression is much weaker than that expected for s_{\pm}-wave superconductors, as in the case of Co-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}.

## II Experimental Methods

Single crystals of underdoped and optimally K-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} were grown by FeAs self-flux method, whereas overdoped single crystals were synthesized by using other flux.[22] The actual K-doping level was determined by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The resultant x of Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} was 0.23, 0.42, and 0.69 for underdoped, optimally doped, and overdoped crystals, respectively. All crystals were cleaved to be thin plates with thickness less than \sim25 \mum. This value is much smaller than the projected range of 3-MeV H^{+} for Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} of \sim50 \mum, calculated by the stopping and range of ions in matter-2008.[23] Gold  wires were attached to the samples by silver paste with a standard four-probe configuration for _in situ_ resistivity measurements. After they were loaded onto the sapphire plate, these crystals were cooled down by a closed-cycle refrigerator at the terminal of the irradiation port. The 3-MeV H^{+} irradiation at T=50 K was performed parallel to the c axis at NIRS-HIMAC. Since random point defects including Frenkel pairs, some of which are mobile even at room T (Ref. [24]), are expected to be produced by 3-MeV H^{+} irradiation,[25] we kept the temperature low (\leqslant50 K) to stabilize defects during the following resistance measurements. The proton flux was limited to \lesssim10^{12} ions/cm^{2}/s to avoid excessive heating of the crystals. The magneto-optical imaging was performed by using the local-field-dependent Faraday effect in the in-plane magnetized garnet indicator film employing a differential method.[26, 27]

## III Results and discussion

To ensure the quality of the samples, we have measured the resistivity (\rho) in a wide range of temperature (T). Figure 1 represents the result of \rho-T measurements in the as-grown samples, which are identical to those used in the irradiation study in the following. The absolute value of \rho at T=300 K is slightly reduced with increasing x. Upon cooling, the crossover from high-T convex to low-T concave behavior is observed at the characteristic T^{*}\simeq 100 K. These results are quite consistent with the previous reports.[20, 28] In the low-T region T\ll T^{*}, a quadratic T dependence of \rho is observed in all three samples, which is obvious in the inset of Fig. 1. The superconducting transition occurs at T_{c}=24.4 K, 37.4 K, and 17.8 K, in x=0.23, 0.42, and 0.69, respectively, where T_{c} is defined by the midpoint of resistive transition. These values of T_{c} almost coincide with the onset of the Meissner signal measured by the superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer, which gives evidence for the bulk transition.

The central issue of this study is to clarify the relationship between the evolution of \rho_{0} and the reduction of T_{c}, where \rho_{0} is the residual resistivity. For this purpose, we have employed _in situ_ resistance measurements right after the introduction of scattering centers. The \rho-T measurements after the H^{+} irradiation up to a dose of 9.2\times 10^{16} ions/cm^{2} are illustrated in Fig. 2. Regarding the normal state behavior, all samples show a parallel shift upon irradiation without any low-T upturn, indicating that the point defects introduced by this irradiation are nonmagnetic and no localization effects appear. This fact is quite important in view of the study of pair-breaking effects, since the stiffness of the superconductivity to the nonmagnetic scattering is the key to distinguish the possible sign-reversing order parameter. To estimate the impurity scattering rate, we have extrapolated \rho in the normal state to T=0 K with a function of \rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{2} and calculated \Delta\rho_{0}\equiv\rho_{0}^{i}-\rho_{0}^{0}, where \rho_{0}^{i} is \rho_{0} of the ith irradiation. The evolutions of \Delta\rho_{0} with the dose are depicted in Fig. 3(a). An almost linear increase in \Delta\rho_{0} is evident in all samples, although the slope of the underdoped sample is twice as large as the slopes in the optimally doped and overdoped samples. On the other hand, we can see that T_{c} is gradually suppressed without significant broadening of the transition in all samples except for the tail part. We will come back to this point later. We define T_{c} by the midpoint of a sharp \rho drop, so that T_{c} as a function of the dose is shown in Fig. 3(b). Here the error bars are twice T_{c}^{\rm onset}-T_{c} (T_{c}^{\rm onset} is the onset T of the \rho drop), which is smaller than \sim1 K, except for underdoped sample at higher doses. T_{c} suppression, \Delta T_{c}=T_{c0}-T_{c}, is linear with a maximum reduction of 4.3, 3.0, and 4.3 K, for underdoped, optimally doped, and overdoped samples, respectively, where T_{c0} is T_{c} before the irradiation. It should be noted that this suppression of T_{c} is much larger than that reported for heavy-ion irradiated (Ba,K)Fe_{2}As_{2} with a matching field of 21 T (\Delta T_{c}\sim 0.3 K), where the average spacing of columnar defects is 100 A(Ref. [29]).

Figure 4 represents T_{c} (main panel) and T_{c}/T_{c0} (inset) as a function of \Delta\rho_{0}. The suppression rates of T_{c}, -\Delta T_{c}/\Delta\rho_{0}, are 65 K/m\Omega cm, 95 K/m\Omega cm, and 161 K/m\Omega cm for x=0.23, 0.42, and 0.69, respectively. It is noteworthy that these values are comparable to the value of 46-77 K/m\Omega cm in chemically substituted Ba_{0.5}K_{0.5}Fe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [17]). The linear extrapolation, drawn by broken lines in Fig. 4, gives the critical residual resistivity value \Delta\rho_{0}^{\rm cr} to fully suppress T_{c} as 376,

  396, and 110 \mu\Omega cm, respectively. These values of \Delta\rho_{0}^{\rm cr} for the underdoped and optimally doped samples are similar to previous reports (100-1000 \mu\Omega cm) [14, 15, 16, 17] and consistent with theoretical study.[3] The overdoped sample, on the other hand, has a smaller \Delta\rho_{0}^{\rm cr}. The fast suppression rate of T_{c} in the overdoped sample can be seen even in the T_{c}/T_{c0} vs \Delta\rho_{0}, depicted in the inset of Fig. 4. The slope in the overdoped sample is 3.5 times larger than the slopes of the underdoped and optimally doped samples.

For quantitative discussion of pair-breaking effects by nonmagnetic scatterings, we evaluate the normalized scattering rate g=\hbar/2\pi k_{B}T_{c0}\tau, where \hbar, k_{B}, and \tau are the Planck's constant divided by 2\pi, the Boltzmann constant, and the scattering time, respectively. If we assume the intraband scattering rate \tau_{\rm intra}^{-1} and the interband scattering rate \tau_{\rm inter}^{-1} are the same, i.e., \tau_{\rm intra}^{-1}\simeq\tau_{\rm inter}^{-1}\equiv\tau^{-1}, then 1/\Delta\rho_{0}=1/\Delta\rho_{\rm intra}+1/\Delta\rho_{\rm intra}=(ne^{2}/m^ {*})(\tau_{\rm intra}+\tau_{\rm inter})=2ne^{2}/m^{*}\tau^{-1}, and we can estimate \tau^{-1} from \Delta\rho_{0} as \tau^{-1}=2ne^{2}\Delta\rho_{0}/m^{*}, where n is the carrier density, e is the elementary charge, and m^{*} is the effective quasiparticle mass. In the following, we show three different estimations of g: g^{\rm 5oth}, g^{\rm 3}, and g^{H}, which are described in Figs. 5(a), 5(b), and 5(c), respectively.

According to linear response theory based on the five-orbital model, we obtain the relation \Delta\rho_{0} (\mu\Omega cm) = 0.18\tau^{-1} (K) in Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}, leading to the first estimation of g^{\rm 5oth}=0.882\Delta\rho_{0}/T_{c0}, where z is the renormalization factor.[30] The angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurement in Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2} gives a result of the renormalization factor z=1/2 (Refs. [31] and [32]). The obtained T_{c}/T_{c0} as a function of g^{\rm 5oth} is shown in Fig. 5(a). The critical values of g(\equiv g_{c}) where the linear extrapolation of T_{c}/T_{c0} goes to zero are evaluated as 6.8, 4.7, and 2.7 in x=0.23, 0.42, and 0.69, respectively. These values compare well with those obtained for substitutions of Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn for Fe in almost optimally doped crystals of Ba_{0.5}K_{0.5}Fe_{2}As_{2}, g_{c}=4-8.[17]

With London penetration depth \lambda=\sqrt{m^{*}/\mu_{0}ne^{2}}, we can obtain another estimation of \tau^{-1} as \tau^{-1}=ne^{2}\Delta\rho_{0}/m^{*}=\Delta\rho_{0}/\mu_{0}\omega^{2}, where \mu_{0} is the vacuum permeability. It is noted that the use of \lambda allows us to avoid direct estimation of n and m^{*}. Optical measurements in the low-frequency limit give \lambda\simeq 2000 A in Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [33]). Without considering the K doping dependence of \lambda, we obtain the second estimation g^{\lambda}=\hbar\Delta\rho_{0}/\pi k_{B}T_{c0}\mu_{0}\lambda^{2}. T_{c}/T_{c0} as a function of g^{\lambda} is shown in Fig. 5(b). The critical values g_{c} of the normalized scattering rate obtained from linear extrapolations are 7.5, 5.1, and 3.0 in x=0.23, 0.42, and 0.69, respectively.

The conventional approach to estimate carrier density n is from Hall coefficient R_{H} measurements. R_{H} at 300 K is reported to be \sim1 \times 10^{-9} m^{3}/C (Refs. [28, 34], which offers the third estimation of g^{H}=\hbar\Delta\rho_{0}e/\pi k_{B}T_{c0}m^{*}R_{H}. With the mass enhancement factor m^{*}=2m as mentioned above, the critical scattering rates g_{c} for x=0.23, 0.42, and 0.69 are estimated as g_{c}=33, 23, and 13, respectively. Here m is assumed to be the free electron mass. These values are more than 4 times larger than the other estimations above. This is possibly because R_{H} is not a good measure of n in Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}, since the T variation of R_{H} is ascribed to several contributions such as multiband nature, antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, Fermi surface reconstruction, and so on. Unfortunately, it is difficult to separate these contributions from others. For example, Ohgushi and Kiuchi analyzed R_{H} in Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} assuming a two-band model with an expression of hole carrier density n_{h}=n_{0}+\frac{x}{2}\frac{m_{n}}{m_{n}+m_{e}} and electron carrier density n_{e}=n_{0}-\frac{x}{2}\frac{m_{e}}{m_{n}+m_{e}} and found a strong T dependence of n_{0} and m_{h}/m_{e} (Ref. [28]). This means that the estimation of g^{H} largely depends on the choice of T in  R_{H}. In addition, we cannot use R_{H} at low T since an apparent spin-fluctuation effect is identified as evidenced by a strong T dependence of R_{H}, especially in underdoped samples. Thus g^{H} must overestimate the scattering rate.

These three results should be compared with the s_{\pm}-wave scenario with equal gap magnitudes of opposite signs on different FSs. Provided the simplest assumption of \tau_{\rm intra}^{-1}=\tau_{\rm inter}^{-1}, the pair breaking is evaluated by the Abrikosov-Gory'kov formula, -\ln T_{c}/T_{c0}=\psi(1/2+gT_{c0}/2T_{c})-\psi(1/2), where \psi(x) is a diagramma function and g=\hbar\tau_{\rm inter}^{-1}/2\pi k_{B}T_{c0}. The obtained critical g in this scenario is g_{c}^{\pm}\simeq 0.3, as shown in Figs. 5(a)-5(c). Obviously, all estimates of g_{c} are much larger than g_{c}^{\pm}\simeq 0.3. By contrast, it is expected that the rate of T_{c} suppression is much smaller in the s_{++}-wave scenario. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that the realization of the s_{\pm}-wave gap function in K-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} is unlikely. However, it should be noted that an impurity-robust s_{\pm} state has recently been discussed by changing the ratio of inter- to intraband scatterings.[36, 37] To examine if the anomalously small ratio of inter- to intraband scattering is feasible, Yamakawa _et al.[38]_ have recently studied the nonlocal impurity scattering effect in accordance with the first-principle study deriving 3d- and 4d-impurity potentials.[39] They have found that the negligible interband scattering is unrealistic and -\Delta T_{c}/\Delta\rho_{0} is independent of the impurity potential strength and T_{c0}. They concluded that the s_{\pm}-wave state is inconsistent with the experimental results reported in IBSs, which is consistent with the local impurity model in Ref. [4]. The results obtained in Refs. [3, 36, 37, and 40, 41, 42, 43, 44] are based on orbital-less multiband model. In this model, the amplitude of interband scattering becomes negligible in a unitary impurity scattering regime. This is why a wide range of ratios of intra- to interband scatterings is examined, and at a small interband scattering rate the superconductivity is robust even in the s_{\pm}-wave state. However, this model neglects the momentum dependence of the impurity potential originated from the orbital degrees of freedom. When taking it into account, i.e., based on the five-orbital model, it is revealed that a large interband scattering should appear and the s_{\pm} state is fragile. Hence, we must adopt the comparable interband scattering to the intraband one. Although we cannot specify the ratio of inter- to intraband scattering rates, the ratio is not completely an arbitrary assumption. Our present results manifest the robustness of T_{c} against the introduction of impurity scatterings, and based on the above consideration, we can safely conclude that they are inconsistent with the s_{\pm}-wave state in the Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} system. We should additionally point out that faster suppression of T_{c}/T_{c0} in highly overdoped samples is possibly realized if the mass enhancement m^{*}/m is large, taking the stronger correlation in the end member of KFe_{2}As_{2} into account.[45, 46] The disappearance of the electron FS sheets and the negligible gap size of the outer hole FS are reported for x\geq 0.6, leading to possible crossover of the superconducting order parameter, caused by the competition between the pairing mechanisms, probably the orbital fluctuation and the spin fluctuation.[47, 48] The observed faster suppression of T_{c}/T_{c0} in the x=0.69 sample might be related to such differences.

Here we stress the advantage of K-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} to discuss impurity effects. As already mentioned above, the as-grown K-doped system has no intrinsic impurity scattering, i.e., negligible RR, so we can discuss all the above by means of \rho_{0} instead of \Delta\rho_{0}. This enables us to make a straightforward transformation from the RR to the impurity scattering rate.

  Even if we do so, the obtained results are almost the same because of very small \rho_{0}^{0}. This point gives a significant advantage compared with the Co-doped system, where we can understand the origin of the increment \Delta\rho_{0} only but not clearly of \rho_{0}^{0}. Once we are able to obtain high-quality single crystals of K-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}, the study in this sample is more suitable than that in the Co-doped one to purely testify to the robustness of superconductivity against impurity scattering.

Finally, we comment on the tail of resistive transition. Namely, by increasing the irradiation dose, a finite value of \rho remains after the main superconducting transition followed by the second broad transition at a low T. To clarify the origin, we performed magneto-optical (MO) imaging in a similar crystal of H^{+}-irradiated Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2} [Fig. 6(b)] after carefully removing silver paste and gold wires. Figure 6(a) shows an example of the MO image at T=33 K under H=5 Oe. Under this low-field condition, the superconducting region gives a Meissner response, which shows up as a dark part in the MO image. This is actually observed in most parts of the crystal. Additional dark regions are detected at the very narrow regions just beneath gold wires, surrounded by bright regions, where the superconductivity is weakened or lost. This positional-dependent magnetic response addresses lower T_{c} beneath the silver paste. One of the possible origins for such a stronger suppression of T_{c} is that lower-energy H^{+} ions and/or the secondary electrons generated in the silver paste are more effective in introducing point defects. Hence we conclude that the fast suppression of superconductivity under silver paste accompanied by the spatially modulated T_{c} is the origin of the tail in resistive transition. A close inspection of the \rho-T data in Fig. 2 allows us to roughly estimate (T_{c0}-T_{c}^{\rho=0})/\Delta T_{c}\sim 2 in x=0.23 and 0.42, while \sim3 in x=0.69. Since \Delta T_{c} is proportional to \Delta\rho_{0}, \rho_{0} of the part beneath the silver paste is estimated to be twice as large as that of the bare part in x=0.23 and 0.42, while it is 3 times as large in x=0.69. Here the main transition at T_{c} is attributed to the property of the bare parts and zero resistivity appears at T_{c}^{\rho=0} as a consequence of transition in the region beneath the silver paste. Since the volume beneath the silver paste is much smaller than that of the bare parts, the serial circuit of these parts provides only a small correction to \rho_{0}. Such a few percent enhancement of the RR does not affect the pair-breaking discussion above.

## IV Summary

We have evaluated the impurity effects in underdoped, optimally doped, and overdoped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} single crystals by means of 3-MeV H^{+} irradiation. All samples show a parallel shift of the \rho-T curves by the irradiation, which manifests that defects introduced by the irradiation are nonmagnetic and are not causing localization effects. Almost linear variations of \Delta\rho_{0} and T_{c} as a function of dose are obtained. The critical value of the normalized scattering rate g_{c} is estimated by three different methods. By assuming a realistic condition of similar magnitudes of intra- and interband scattering rates, all obtained g_{c}'s are much larger than g_{c}^{\pm}, inconsistent with the s_{\pm}-wave state in Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}.
