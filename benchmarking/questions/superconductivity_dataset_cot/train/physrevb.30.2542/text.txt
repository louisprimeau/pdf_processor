###### Abstract

From low-temperature measurements of the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility, we determined \(T_{c}\), \(\gamma\), and \(\chi^{\rm spin}\) for both the cubic and the rhombohedral phase of the C15 compound V\({}_{2}\)Zr. In addition, neutron-diffraction experiments were performed for a proper identification of these two phases. We found that the martensitic transformation (\(T_{M}\!\sim\!110\) K) from the cubic to the rhombohedral phase leads to a substantial reduction in \(\gamma\) and \(\chi^{\rm spin}\). \(\gamma_{\rm cub}\) (\(\gamma_{\rm rh}\!\sim\!23\) (16) mJ/g-at.\(\,\)K\({}^{2}\) and \(\chi^{\rm spin}_{\rm cub}\) (\(\chi^{\rm spin}_{\rm rh}\!\sim\!2.1\!\times\!10^{-7}\) (1.4\!\times\!10^{-4}\)) emu/g-at. In contrast, \(T_{c}\) is only slightly changed: \(T_{c}^{\rm cub}\!\sim\!8.7\) K and \(T_{c}^{\rm rh}\!\sim\!8.0\) K. Together with the fact that the "Wilson ratio" \(N(\chi)/N(\gamma)\!\sim\!0.7\)_in both phases_, we take our findings as clear evidence that in V\({}_{2}\)Zr \(T_{c}\) is limited by spin fluctuations.

## I Introduction

A high electronic density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level, \(N(0)\), favors the onset of superconductivity in two respects. First, since the formation of Cooper pairs is restricted to the immediate neighborhood of the Fermi surface, \(N(0)\) is a direct measure for the number of electrons sharing the superconducting quantum state. In BCS theory, this is reflected by the explicit appearance of \(N(0)\) in the coupling strength, \(\lambda_{\rm BCS}\!=\!N(0)V\). Second, the interaction \(V\) which is mediated by virtual phonon exchange, is itself a function of \(N(0)\). A higher \(N(0)\) leads to phonon softening and thus to a higher \(V\), although this effect may partly be compensated by enhanced screening of the electron-phonon vertex.[1] On the other hand, this phonon softening can culminate in an electronically driven (Jahn-Teller--type) phase transition into a stabler phase with lower \(N(0)\) and thus weaker electron-phonon coupling. Also, changes in \(N(0)\) affect the Coulomb repulsion between the electrons, i.e., \(\mu^{\star}\). In particular, in cooperation with Coulomb exchange and correlation, an increasing \(N(0)\)_always_ implies a growing tendency towards itinerant magnetism, thus leading either to a depression of \(T_{c}\) by spin fluctuations or even to the total quenching of superconductivity.

Combining all these effects, one may imagine situations where for a superconductor, \(T_{c}\) can still be raised by raising \(N(0)\), i.e., where \(dT_{c}/dN(0)\!>\!0\), as well as situations where \(dT_{c}/dN(0)\!<\!0\). In this latter case, the optimum value for \(N(0)\) has already been surpassed, and an increase in \(T_{c}\) requires a _reduction_ of \(N(0)\). (Pd may be an example of this rare happening[2].) Thus, when looking for high-\(T_{c}\) superconductivity within a given class of materials, it is of particular interest to find the point where \(dT_{c}/dN(0)\!\sim\!0\), i.e., to meet the optimum conditions for high \(T_{c}\) with respect to \(N(0)\).

In this paper, we present experimental evidence for the fact that in the \(C15\) compound V\({}_{2}\)Zr, such an optimum situation has nearly been achieved. In several respects, V\({}_{2}\)Zr is reminiscent of the high-\(T_{c}\)\(A15\) compounds V\({}_{3}\)Si and Nb\({}_{3}\)Sn. It has a high magnetic susceptibility \(\chi(T)\) with an anomalously large temperature dependence, and it undergoes a martensitic phase transformation from the cubic into a rhombohedral phase below \(T_{M}\!\sim\!110\) K,[3] while V\({}_{3}\)Si and Nb\({}_{3}\)Sn undergo martensitic transitions to the tetragonal phase at \(\sim\!21\) and \(\sim\!45\) K, respectively. Actually, recent band-structure calculations[4, 5] have shown that the electronic DOS in V\({}_{2}\)Zr is very similar to that in V\({}_{3}\)Si: At \(\epsilon_{F}\), its height is about 110 states/spin Ry unit-cell and it has a sharp peak close to \(\epsilon_{F}\).

In our experiments, we exploited the fact that the martensitic transformation in V\({}_{2}\)Zr into the rhombohedral phase can be hindered by very small amounts of residual strain or concentration gradients. All our samples underwent the martensitic transformation only partly, thus allowing the simultaneous observation of both phases at low temperatures. By performing neutron scattering experiments and measurements of the magnetic susceptibilities and low-temperature specific heat, we were able to assign distinct values for \(T_{c}\), \(\gamma\), and \(\chi\) to both the cubic and the rhombohedral phase. While there is already experimental information on \(T_{c}\), \(\gamma\), and \(\chi\) for the rhombohedral phase of V\({}_{2}\)Zr,[4, 6, 7] to our knowledge we are the first to present values of \(\gamma\) and \(T_{c}\) for the cubic phase. Our central result is the finding that the phase transformation into the rhombohedral phase leads to a substantial decrease in \(\gamma\) and \(\chi^{\rm spin}\), and hence in \(N(0)\), while \(T_{c}\) is lowered by only 0.7 K, thus proving that \(dT_{c}/dN(0)\) is close to 0 in this compound.

The remainder of the paper is organized into five sections. Sample preparation and characterization are discussed in Sec. II, the neutron scattering experiments in Sec. III. Sections IV and V, respectively, deal with the measurement and evaluation of the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility. In Sec. VI we discuss our results and present our final conclusions.

 

## II Sample preparation and characterization

The samples were prepared from V and Zr rods with a purity of 99.7% and 99.9%, respectively, purchased from MRC Corporation. The components were weighed to give the V2Zr composition and melted in a levitation crucible under vacuum better than 10-5 mbar to produce ingots of 5 g. Each ingot was remelted four times to ensure homogeneity. Weight losses were negligible. These as-cast samples showed a microstructure typical of a peritectic decomposition: homogeneously distributed V grains surrounded by a V2Zr layer and a V2Zr/a-Zr eutectic. The bulk percentage of V2Zr phase was less than 30%. After a 120-h heat treatment under argon at 1200 degC, metallographic and x-ray analysis revealed mostly single phase V2Zr (_a_0 = 7.448 A) with small amounts of a second phase (~3%). This second phase could be identified as V3Zr3Ox with _g_-carbide structure as described by Rotella _et al._8

For our investigations, we used four different samples \(S\)1 to S4, each of them with an approximate weight of 150 mg. \(S\)1, \(S\)2, and \(S\)4 were taken from different sites of the same ingot, \(S\)3 from a different ingot. Though from the same ingot, \(S\)1, \(S\)2, and \(S\)4 differed appreciably in the bulk percentage of material undergoing the martensitic phase transformation into the rhombohedral phase. This is an indication of the strong sensitivity of this structural transition to small concentration gradients or residual strains.

## III Neutron diffraction

Neutron powder diffraction experiments were performed using a three-axis spectrometer at the ORPHEE reactor in Saclay. The energy of the neutrons was 14.7 meV. Diffraction patterns were taken on \(S\)2 and \(S\)3 for both the (111) and the (220) reflex in the temperature range 15 <= \(T\) <= 300 K. In the low-temperature rhombohedral phase, the (111) reflex splits into (10.1) and (0.03) (in hexagonal indices) with ratio 3:1, and the (220) reflex into (11.0) and (10.4) with ratio 1:1. We observed both splittings. Figure 1 presents our scattering results on \(S\)3 at \(T\) ~15 K together with a least-squares fit using three Gaussians. Besides the split lines, an unsplit cubic remainder is clearly recognizable. From the ratio _IS_/_I_T_ (where _IS_ is intensity in the split lines and _I_T is the total intensity) we determined the fraction of rhombohedral phase, \(p_{h}\), to be 0.88 +- 0.02 in \(S\)3. From a similar analysis of the scattering results on \(S\)2, we obtained \(p_{h}\) = 0.7 +- 0.1 (see Table 1). The large error bar is due to the fact that this sample showed large texture, i.e., the extracted \(p_{h}\) depended considerably on the sample orientation.

From our scattering results on \(S\)3, we also determined the _c/a_ ratio in the rhombohedral phase. The hexagonal lattice parameters \(a\) and \(c\) are defined by \(a\) = \(a\)0(1 + _e_)/_V_2 and \(c\) = \(a\)0(1 - 2_e_)/_V_3, where \(a\)0 is the cubic lattice constant and \(e\) the strain parameter. We found _c/a_ = 2.329 +- 0.001 (_e_ = 0.017), in very good agreement with the results by Moncton.9 We note that the asymmetry in the intensities of the split lines (see Fig. 1) is also present in the diffraction pattern of Ref. 9. Probably, atomic displacements within the rhombohedral unit cell lead to small changes in the structure factors.

We also tried to detect the martensitic transformation by x-ray powder diffraction as a function of temperature, using both Cu _K_a and Mo _K_a_ radiation, but without success. Even on powder samples (grain size 10-100 _m_m) we could not find any trace of line splitting at low temperatures. Obviously, in our sample the transformation is prevented in the neighborhood of a surface while bulk susceptibility measurements still indicated transforming material. This underlines the necessity of probing the _bulk_.

Finally, we note that to some extent, the bulk fraction \(p_{h}\) of the transformed phase can be further increased by slower cooling or by repeated cooling cycles ("training"). We investigated this in an additional neutron scattering experiment on a virgin sample. We found this effect to be of the correct order of magnitude to explain the fact that

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} Sample & \(p_{h}\)(_n_) & \(p_{h}\)(_c_) & \(p_{h}\)(_c_) \\ \(S\)1 & & 0.58 ± 0.06 & 0.58 \\ \(S\)2 & 0.70 ± 0.10 & 0.80 ± 0.04 & 0.73 \\ \(S\)3 & 0.88 ± 0.02 & 0.96 ± 0.005 & 0.96a \\ \(S\)4 & & 0.90 ± 0.01 & \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Bulk fractions \(p_{h}\) of rhombohedral phase in \(S\)1 to \(S\)4 as determined by neutron scattering (_n_), specific heat (_c_), and magnetic susceptibility (_kh_) measurements.

Figure 1: Splitting of the (220) reflex in V2Zr at low temperatures as observed by neutron scattering on sample \(S\)3; in this sample, the unsplit cubic remainder is about 12%. The data have been fitted by three Gaussians (dashed lines).

 \(p_{\rm th}\) as extracted from neutron scattering data was slightly lower than \(p_{\rm rh}\) as determined from specific-heat and susceptibility data. (Neutron scattering was always performed _first_ and after rather rapid cooling.)

## IV Specific heat

Specific-heat data were taken on \(S1\) to \(S4\) in a heat-pulse calorimeter. On \(S4\), additional measurements in a magnetic field of 13 T were performed in a superconducting magnet. Temperatures in zero field were determined by an unencapsulated glass-carbon thermometer calibrated in each run against a calibrated encapsulated glass-carbon thermometer from Lakeshore, and those in field by both the known [10] magnetoresistance of the glass-carbon element and a capacitance thermometer from Lakeshore. We checked our calibration by measuring the specific heat of a 212-mg high-purity sample of germanium both in 0 and 13 T and comparing with published values. [11] From this, we estimate the accuracy for our specific-heat data in 0 and 13 T to be within 3% with an error of about \(\pm 50\) mK in temperature.

In Fig. 2, \(C(T)/T\) versus \(T^{2}\) is shown in zero field for \(S1\) to \(S4\). Figure 3 shows the corresponding plot for \(S4\) with and without magnetic field. For zero field, all curves display two distinct superconducting transitions. We identify the lower transition as that of the rhombohedral phase, and designate by \(\Delta C_{\rm rh}\) and \(T_{\rm c}^{\rm rh}\), respectively, the discontinuity in \(C(T)\) and the transition temperature of this phase. Accordingly, the higher transition (with \(\Delta C_{\rm sub}\) and \(T_{\rm c}^{\rm sub}\)) is identified as that of the cubic phase. These identifications are of central importance for the discussion below. They are based on the quantitative determination of the cubic and rhombohedral-phase percentages through our neutron-diffraction experiments and magnetic susceptibility measurements (see below). Regarding the data taken in magnetic field, the lower transition is clearly recognizable at \(\sim\) 3 K, while the weak step at \(\sim\) 5 K could be interpreted as an indication of the higher transition, in fair agreement with the results of Levinson. [12]

In the normal state, the experimental results were analyzed by fitting them to

\[C_{N}(T) = \gamma T+\beta T^{3} + \alpha T^{5}\ ,\] (1)

with the usual requirement that the entropy above \(T_{\rm c}^{\rm sub}\) be independent of the superconducting phase transition. The resultant \(T_{\rm c}\), \(\gamma\), and \(\Theta_{D} = (12\pi^{a}nk_{B}/5\beta)^{1/3}\) are listed in Table 2. In zero field, all our \(T_{\rm c}\)'s are rather high, making the extrapolation of (1) down to \(T = 0\)_a priori_ doubtful. A check of this extrapolation is provided for \(S4\) by depressing \(T_{\rm c}\) below 5 K in a magnetic field. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, for this sample the extrapolation from above 8.8 K proves to be exact down to about 5 K, leaving little doubt that the \(\gamma\) values of the other samples are reliable, too. In order to extract the phase fraction \(p_{\rm rh}\) and \(p_{\rm cub}\) of rhombohedral and cubic phase, respectively, from our specific-heat data and to calculate the respective \(\gamma\) and \(\Delta C\), we made use of the relations

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}  & \(T_{\rm c}^{\rm sub}\) & \(T_{\rm c}^{\rm rh}\) & & & \(\Theta_{D}\) \\ Sample & (K) & (K) & \(\gamma\) & (mJ/g-at. K\({}^{2}\)) & (K) \\ \hline \(S1\) & 8.7 & 8.0 & 18.9 & 189 \\ \(S2\) & 8.7 & 8.0 & 17.8 & 195 \\ \(S3\) & 8.

  \[\gamma = p_{\rm rh}\gamma_{\rm rh} + p_{\rm cub}\gamma_{\rm cub}\;,\]

\[\Delta C_{\alpha} = 1.43p_{\alpha}\gamma_{\alpha}T_{\epsilon}^{\alpha}\epsilon_{\alpha}\;,\]

where \(a\) stands for rh or cub and where _ea_ allows for possible strong-coupling corrections to the BCS result. Since \(S\)3 transformed almost completely, \(g\) rh and _eh_ could be determined virtually independently of the first guess made for \(g\) cub and \(p\) cub and we found \(g\) rh = 16.1 +- 0.5 mJ/g-at. K2 and _eh_ rh = 1.3. Assuming13 _eh_/_e_ cub = 1.0 +- 0.2, \(g\) cub was calculated from the data for \(S\)1 (the sample with the highest cubic remainder) to be 23 +- 1 mJ/g-at. K2. A reduction of the quoted error bars by including the results for \(S\)2 and \(S\)4 is not possible. Since these samples have rather low cubic-phase fractions, they could only be used to provide information on the rhombohedral phase, which was already known from the results for \(S\)3 with much higher accuracy. The final values for \(p\) rh from specific heat are listed in Table I.

Our results compare well with those by Rapp and Vieland,Rapp and Vieland (1979) as far as \(g\) rh and _T_\({}_{\rm rh}^{\alpha}\) are concerned. Indeed, these authors also reported two distinct discontinuities in their specific-heat data, but were unable to identify the minor phase (volume fraction ~7%, \(T_{C}\) ~ 8.5 K) or to determine its \(g\). In our opinion, their minor phase is very likely to have been cubic ZrV2 as observed in all of our samples.

## V Magnetic susceptibility

The magnetic susceptibility _kh_(_T_) was determined from magnetization measurements in fields up to 5 T using a Faraday balance which allowed us to eliminate traces of (ferromagnetic) impurities. The Faraday balance was calibrated against the known susceptibility of high-purity silver.Kimura (1979); Kimura (1979) The absolute accuracy which is mainly determined by the error in the position of the sample in the magnetic field of the solenoid was estimated to be 2.5%. The relative accuracy of _kh_(_T_) in an experiment with no change of the sample was better than 0.2%. Data were taken within the temperature range 20 < \(T\) <= 260 K in steps of 10 K below 100 K, 5 K in the range 100 < \(T\) < 130 K, and 20 K above 140 K. The error in temperature measurements was less than 0.2%.

Measurements have been performed on samples \(S\)1 to \(S\)3. The corresponding _kh_ versus \(T\) curves are shown in Fig. 4. They all exhibit similar behavior: _kh_(_T_) is strongly temperature dependent over the whole range with a precipitous decrease around \(T_{M}\) ~ 110 K, the temperature where the martensitic phase transformation occurs. For \(S\)3, our data are very similar to those published by Marchenko and Polovov.Marchenko and Polovov (1977) Following these authors, we assign the sharp drop around \(T_{M}\) to a lowering of the spin susceptibility _kh_(_T_) in the rhombohedral phase and assume the orbital contribution _kh_0 to be constant and equal to _kh_0~ 1.8 x 10-4 emu/g-at. for both phases. In order to determine the low-temperature susceptibility of the cubic phase, we make use of the theoretical calculation of _kh_sub(_T_) by Klein _et al.Klein _et al._ (1979) to extrapolate this quantity from \(T\) > 100 K down to 20 K (see Fig. 4). This gives _kh_sub~ 2.1 x 10-4 emu/g-at. Since \(S\)3 is the sample with the highest amount of rhombohedral phase, _kh_th(20) is best extracted from the data taken on \(S\)3. Making use of the decomposition

\[\chi^{\rm q}(20) = p_{\rm rh}\chi^{\rm q}_{\rm rh}(20) + (1 - p_{\rm rh})\chi^{\rm q}_{\rm cub}(20)\;,\]

and assuming \(p_{h}\) ~ 0.96 in \(S\)3 (from the specific-heat data, see Table I), we obtained \(\chi^{\rm q}_{\rm rh}(20) \sim 1.4 \times 10^{- 4}\) emu/g-at. From these numbers, \(p\) rh for \(S\)1 and \(S\)2 can readily be determined via Eq. (3) (see Table II). We did not give any error bars to these numbers which are all based on a rather rough guess for _kh_0. We emphasize, however, that the reason for our susceptibility measurements was not the determination of _kh_sub and _kh_th, which were already known from Refs. Marchenko and Marchenko, 1977 and Marchenko, 1977. Rather, our interest was focused on the rhombohedral and cubic phase portions \(p\) rh and \(p\) cub for the different samples, since confirmation of these numbers is of vital importance for phase identifications and thus for our conclusions.

## VI Discussion and conclusions

Regarding the fractions of rhombohedral phase, \(p\) rh, as deduced by different methods for our samples \(S\)1 - \(S\)4 (see Table I), a clear correlation shows up: The amount of remaining cubic phase at low temperature is reflected quantitatively by the results of three different measurements independent of each other. Small discrepancies (regarding mainly the neutron scattering results) can be explained by training effects, different cooling cycles, and

Figure 4: Magnetic susceptibility _kh_(_T_) versus temperature for \(S\)1 to \(S\)3; the chain line extrapolates _kh_(_T_) for the cubic phase following Ref. Kälter _et al._ (1979). The small differences in _kh_(_T_) for \(T\) > 130 K (completely cubic phase) among the samples may be due to both slightly different positioning of the samples in the field gradient and small changes in stoichiometry, but note that our interest is mainly focused on the individual depression of _kh_ below \(T_{M}\) for each sample.

  texture. Thus a clear identification of the amounts of the two phases is possible. This allows us to assign unequivocally distinct values for \(g\), _kh_(20), and _Tc_ to both the cubic and the rhombohedral phase. We consider this to be our main success, particularly, when contrasted with earlier work on Nb3Sn.15 Those experiments aimed at determining \(g\) and _Tc_ of the cubic and tetragonal phase of this compound, but failed insofar as they did not allow the observation of two distinct discontinuities in the specific heat. Only the superconducting transition of the tetragonal phase in Nb3Sn could be observed, leaving _Tc_ for the cubic phase unclear. The reason for this may be found in the fact that in Nb3Sn a considerable amount of impurities or defects is needed to stabilize the cubic phase at low temperatures. As a consequence, this phase in Nb3Sn is no longer well defined, but rather consists of a distribution of phases with different _Tc_'s, thus smearing out the discontinuity in the specific heat. Contrary to this, from the present experiments we know that very small amounts of residual strain or stoichiometry variations are able to stabilize the cubic phase of V2Zr, which remains well defined with a sharp superconducting transition.

Our central result is the observation that whereas both \(g\) and _kh_(20) are lowered by about 30% in the rhombohedral phase, the respective _Tc_'s of the cubic and rhombohedral phase differ by only 0.7 K. In view of the fact that at least for medium coupling strength \(l\), _Tc_ depends exponentially on \(l\), this is an almost negligible change. In the sense of what has been outlined in the Introduction, it indicates that _dT__c_ /_dN_(0) ~ 0 in V2Zr, i.e., that this system is very close to an optimum situation for _Tc_ with respect to changes in the electronic density of states at \(e_{F}\). Let us analyze this further in terms of the quasiparticle DOS, _N_(_g_) and _N_(_kh_), as defined by

\[\begin{array}{l} {N\left( \gamma \right) = 3\gamma/2\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}}\;, \\ {N\left( \chi \right) = \chi^{2}(20)/2\mu_{B}^{2}}\;. \\ \end{array}\]

From these quantities, the mass enhancement factor (1 + _l_) = _N_(_g_)/_N_(0) and the Stoner enhancement factor \(S\) = _N_(_kh_)/_N_(0) can be deduced if the bare DOS _N_(0) is known. In both Refs. 4 and 5, a value for _N_(0) of about 110 states/spin Ry unit-cell has been given for the cubic phase of V2Zr, while there exists no band-structure calculations for the rhombohedral phase. Following Ref. 4, one may obtain a guess for _N_(0) in the rhombohedral phase if one assumes the exchange interaction \(U\) which enters the Stoner factor \(S\) via

\[S = 1/[1 - N(0)U]\]

is the same for both phases. Then \(U\) can be fixed for the cubic phase, and for the rhombohedral phase we find _N_(0) ~ 91 states/spin Ry unit-cell, i.e., a 20% reduction relative to its value in the more symmetric cubic phase.

What is striking is the very high mass enhancement in both phases. If \(l\) were interpreted as being solely due to electron-phonon coupling, \(l\) _s_-ph_ ~ 2.6 would result for the cubic phase. Together with _Ph_D_ ~ 200 K, such a large value would lead to a much higher _Tc_ than the actual 8.7 K if the Coulomb interaction were treated by the usual _m_* approach with _m_* ~ 0.1. Indeed, starting from a McMillan-type _Tc_ formula, both Refs. 4 and 5 arrived at a _Tc_ for cubic V2Zr that was a factor of 2 -4 higher than the observed 8.7 K. On the other hand, for the cubic phase our _N_(_kh_)/_N_(0) gives ~ 2.4 (Klein _et al._2 even calculated \(S\) ~ 3.8) which indicates a strong pair-breaking influence of spin fluctuations. This means that in V2Zr, _dT__c_/_dN_(0) ~ 0 because of an almost complete balance between strong (_l_ > 1) electron-phonon coupling and spin fluctuations. This idea is further corroborated by the fact that the ratio _N_(_kh_)/_N_(_g_) = _S_/(1 + _l_) is about the same (~ 0.7) for both phases in contrast to the strong individual variations of _N_(_g_) and _N_(_kh_), but in accordance with the almost unchanged _Tc_.

The appearance of spin fluctuations in V2Zr does not come as a surprise. As a vanadium-based superconductor with a high electronic DOS, V2Zr is akin to V, VN, V3Ga, and V3Si, where indications for the coexistence of spin fluctuations and superconductivity have already been reported.16-21 What makes V2Zr a particularly intriguing further example is the possibility of studying the competition between electron-phonon coupling and spin fluctuations during a change (cubic - rhombohedral) in the system.
