###### Abstract

The results of heat capacity C_{\rm p}(T,H) and electrical resistivity \rho(T,H) measurements down to 0.35 K as well as muon spin relaxation and rotation (\muSR) measurements on the noncentrosymmetric superconductor LaIrSi_{3} are presented. Powder neutron diffraction confirmed the reported noncentrosymmetric body-centered tetragonal BaNiSi_{3}-type structure (space group _14 mm_) of LaIrSi_{3}. The bulk superconductivity is observed below T_{\rm c}=0.72(1) K. The intrinsic \Delta C_{\rm c}/\gamma_{\rm z}T_{\rm c}=1.09(3) is significantly smaller than the BCS value of 1.43, and this reduction is accounted for by the \alpha model of BCS superconductivity. The analysis of the superconducting-state C_{\rm c}(T) data by the single-band \alpha model indicates a moderately anisotropic order parameter with the s-wave gap \Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=1.54(2), which is lower than the BCS value of 1.764. Our estimates of various normal- and superconducting-state parameters indicate a weakly coupled electron-phonon-driven type-I s-wave superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3}. The \muSR results also confirm the conventional type-I superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3} with a preserved time-reversal symmetry and hence a singlet pairing superconducting ground state.

## I Introduction

The noncentrosymmetric superconductors (NCSs) that allow mixing between spin-singlet and spin-triplet parity and exhibit exotic superconducting properties through the antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling (ASOC) are of great interest in current research activities on superconductivity [1]. The NCSs lack inversion symmetry in their crystal structure, which leads to a nonuniform lattice potential and hence introduces an antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling. The ASOC removes the spin degeneracy of conduction-band electrons; that is, the spin-up and spin-down energy bands split, and the two electrons forming a Cooper pair no longer belong to the _same_ Fermi surface as in the conventional superconductors. An important consequence of Cooper pair formation by the electrons belonging to two _different_ Fermi surfaces of spin-up and spin-down bands is that the Cooper pair wave function of NCSs can no longer be classified by its parity as a pure spin-singlet or spin-triplet pairing, instead results in a parity mixing of spin singlet-triplet states [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. For centrosymmetric superconductors to which most of the known superconductors belong the spin-up and spin-down energy bands of the conduction electrons are degenerate when time-reversal symmetry is conserved. The structural inversion symmetry thus has a key role in determining the superconducting properties, and a number of unusual phenomena can be observed in such noncentrosymmetric materials [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

First such unusual superconducting behavior was observed in the heavy-fermion superconductor CePt_{3}Si, which crystallizes in a tetragonal structure (space group P4 _mm_) that lacks mirror symmetry along the c axis and undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition below T_{\rm N}=2.2 K and becomes superconducting at the critical temperature T_{\rm c}=0.75 K that coexists with antiferromagnetic ordering [7]. The upper critical field H_{\rm c2}\approx 5 T is very high compared to the Pauli paramagnetic limiting field of \sim1 T, indicating a spin-triplet pairing [7]. For a spin-singlet paring, Pauli paramagnetic limiting is expected. On the other hand, for a system without inversion symmetry spin-triplet pairing is not permitted [1]. These contradicting situations are accounted for by mixed spin singlet-triplet states of the order parameter [6]. The irreducible representation point group for the tetragonal structure of CePt_{3}Si is C_{4v}, in which Rashba-type ASOC exists, which provides the key to understanding the intriguing superconducting behavior of CePt_{3}Si [7, 8, 9]. Following CePt_{3}Si many NCSs have been identified that present interesting superconducting properties, including Li_{2}(Pd,Pt)_{3}B [10, 11], CeRhSi_{3}[12, 13], CeIrSi_{3}[14, 15], CeCoGe_{3}[15, 16], CeIrGe_{3}[17], LaNiC_{2}[18, 19, 20], BaPtSi_{3}[21], (Rh,Ir)Ga_{9}[22, 23], Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16}[24], Mo_{3}Al_{2}C [25], LaRhSi_{3}[26], Ca(Ir,Pt)Si_{3}[27], Re_{3}W [28], Nb_{0.18}Fe_{0.12}[29], Re_{6}Zr [30], La(Pd,Pt)Si_{3}[31], Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Ge_{4}[32], etc.

The Ce-based NCSs CeRhSi_{3}, CeIrSi_{3}, CeCoGe_{3}, and CeIrGe_{3} crystallize with BaNiSn_{3}-type tetragonal structure (space group _14 mm_), which lacks mirror plane symmetry along the c axis and belongs to the same point group, C_{4v}, as CePt_{3}Si. Thus, like CePt_{3}Si, a Rashba-type ASOC is present in these CeMX_{3} compounds too, leading to an exotic superconducting ground state in them [12, 13, 14, 17, 33, 34, 35]. Like CePt_{3}Si, they also exhibit heavy-fermion behavior and undergo a long-range antiferromagnetic ordering; however, they become superconducting only under the application of pressure [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. The above-mentioned Ce-based NCSs are situated close to a magnetic quantum critical point, making it difficult to explore the effects of ASOC and inversion symmetry breaking on superconductivity. Therefore nonmagnetic Rashba-type NCSs are essential for understanding the effect and extent of ASOC on the superconducting properties of these Ce-based NCSs. The reported nonmagnetic AMX_{3} NCSs with BaNiSn_{3}-type tetragonal structure include BaPtSi_{3} (T_{\rm c}=2.25 K), LaRhSi_{3} [T_{\rm c}=2.16(8) K], CaIrSi_{3} (T_{\rm c}=3.6 K), CaPtSi_{3} (T_{\rm c}=2.3 K), LaPdSi_{3} [T_{\rm c}=2.65(5) K], and LaPtSi_{3} [T_{\rm c}=1.52(6) K] [21, 26, 27, 31]. All these nonmagnetic NCSs behave like a conventional s-wave superconductor without any noticeable effect from the absence of inversion symmetry in their crystal structure. Nevertheless, being isostructural, they provide a direct comparison with CeMX_{3} NCSs and the investigations of these nonmagnetic NCSs connote the role of 4f moments in Ce NCSs. One important difference between the CeMX_{3} NCSs and these nonmagnetic NCSs is that CeMX_{3} exhibit superconductivity only at high pressures, whereas these nonmagnetic NCSs superconduct at ambient pressure. This difference may have its origin in magnetic pairing in Ce NCSs in contrast to phonon-mediated superconductivity in these nonmagnetic NCSs.

Theoretically, the Rashba-type ASOC has been studied extensively and is favored for investigations of NCSs; therefore compounds with tetragonal BaNiSn_{3}-type structure represent an important class of noncentrosymmetric materials. Continuing our work on BaNiSn_{3}-type structured materials, we have performed a comprehensive study of superconducting- and normal-state properties of NCS LaIrSi_{3} using heat capacity C_{\rm p} and electrical resistivity \rho versus temperature T measurements down to 0.35 K and muon spin relaxation and rotation (\muSR) measurements down to 50 mK. The reported noncentrosymmetric body-centered tetragonal BaNiSn_{3}-type structure of LaIrSi_{3} is confirmed by our room-temperature powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) and neutron diffraction. Superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3} was reported about 30 years ago with T_{\rm c} between 1.9 and 2.7 K based on resistivity measurement [36, 37]. In a recent study Okuda _et al._ reported a superconducting transition at T_{\rm c}=0.77 K from the heat-capacity measurement on LaIrSi_{3}[33]. Okuda _et al._ also carried out a de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect study and found that as a result of Rashba-type ASOC the Fermi surface of LaIrSi_{3} splits into two Fermi surfaces (spin-up and spin-down energy bands), which are separated by about 1000 K [33]. In our recent investigations of superconducting properties of NCS LaRhSi_{3} we found a conventional type-I superconductivity with preserved time-reversal symmetry, however, with an unusual exponential evolution of the Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma with magnetic field which could be due to the reinforcement of ASOC with magnetic field [26]. Therefore in view of the unusual behavior of LaRhSi_{3} and the strong effect of ASOC in LaIrSi_{3} revealed by the dHvA effect study, it was felt necessary to investigate the superconducting properties of LaIrSi_{3} in detail, which we present in this paper.

Our C_{\rm p}(T) data confirm bulk superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3} below T_{\rm c}=0.72(1) K, in agreement with the report by Okuda _et al._[33]. However, \rho(T) exhibits superconductivity at a higher T_{\rm c}=1.45 K, apparently due to filamentary nonbulk superconductivity. The normal-state \rho is metallic and well described by the Bloch-Gruneisen model of resistivity for T\geqslant 1.6 K. The low-T normal-state C_{\rm p}(T) gives an electronic coefficient \gamma_{\rm n}=4.60(2) mJ/mol K^{2} and a density of states at Fermi energy \mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F})=1.95(1) states/eV f.u. for both spin directions, where f.u. stands for formula unit. A sharp jump is observed at T_{\rm c}=0.72(1) K in electronic heat capacity C_{\rm s}(T), with \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c}=1.09(3), which is smaller than the BCS expected value of 1.43. Within the single-band picture the reduced value of \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c} can be attributed to an anisotropic energy gap in LaIrSi_{3}. We have analyzed the superconducting-state electronic heat-capacity data using the \alpha model of BCS superconductivity [38, 39, 40], which suggests that the s-wave order parameter of LaIrSi_{3} is anisotropic in momentum space, with an energy gap \Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=1.54(2). We have estimated various normal- and superconducting-state parameters that indicate a weak-coupling type-I BCS superconductivity in the dirty limit. Our \muSR investigations also confirm type-I superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3}. Further, \muSR results also show that the time-reversal symmetry is preserved as is expected for a conventional s-wave singlet pairing superconductivity. No evidence of parity mixing is observed as one would have expected in view of splitting of spin-up and spin-down energy bands revealed by dHvA study [33].

## II Experimental details

A polycrystalline sample of LaIrSi_{3} was prepared by the standard arc melting of a stoichiometric mixture of high-purity elements (La: 99.9%, Ir: 99.99%, Si: 99.999%) on a water-cooled copper hearth under the titanium-gettered inert argon atmosphere with several flips to ensure homogeneity. The arc-melted sample was further heat treated at 900 ^{\circ}C for a week under the dynamic vacuum. The crystal structure was determined by the powder XRD using Cu K_{\alpha} radiation. The heat-capacity measurements were performed by the relaxation method with a physical properties measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design, Inc.). The electrical resistivity measurements were performed by the standard four-probe ac technique using the PPMS. Temperatures down to 0.35 K were attained using a ^{3}He attachment to the PPMS.

Powder neutron diffraction (ND) measurement was performed at room temperature using the ROTAX diffractometer at the ISIS facility of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Didcot, United Kingdom. The \muSR measurements were carried out using the MuSR spectrometer at the ISIS facility with the detectors in both longitudinal and transverse configurations. A high-purity-silver plate was used to mount the sample, which gives only a nonrelaxing muon signal. The powdered sample was mounted on silver plate using diluted GE varnish that was covered with Kapton film. Temperatures down to 50 mK were achieved by cooling the sample in a dilution refrigerator. Correction coils were used to counter the effect of the stray fields at the sample position to within 1 \muT.

## III Crystallography

The room-temperature powder XRD data were analyzed by structural Rietveld refinement using the program fullprof[41]. The refinement confirmed the reported BaNiSn_{3}  type tetragonal structure (space group I4 mm) of LaIrSi_{3} and revealed the single-phase nature of the sample without any trace of the impurity phase. The single-phase nature of the whole bulk of the sample is further inferred from the Rietveld refinement of room-temperature powder neutron diffraction data that was performed using the program gsas[42]. The neutron diffraction pattern and refinement profile for the noncentrosymmetric body-centered tetragonal BaNiSn_{3}-type structure are shown in Fig. 1. While refining, no improvement in the fit quality was observed upon refining the occupancies of atomic positions, and within the error bars the atomic occupancies were found to be unity; therefore in the final refinement we fixed the occupancies to unity. The crystallographic parameters obtained from the refinement of powder neutron diffraction are listed in Table 1. Both ND and XRD data gave similar crystallographic parameters and agree well with the literature values [36, 43].

The BaNiSn_{3}-type body-centered tetragonal structure (space group I4 mm) of LaIrSi_{3} is illustrated in Fig. 2 and is compared with the common ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type body-centered tetragonal structure (space group I4/mmm). Like the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure, the BaNiSn_{3}-type structure is also a layered structure and a ternary derivative of BaAl_{4}-type structure [44]. The R (La, Th) atoms occupy identical positions in both structures and form a body-centered tetragonal sublattice. However, they differ in the positions of T (Ir, Cr) and Si atoms. The T atoms form a square sublattice in the _ab_ plane in both structures, but they are rotated by 45^{\circ} in the _ab_ plane with respect to each other. Further, in the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure all the Si atoms occupy a single crystallographic site, whereas in the BaNiSn_{3}-type structure the Si atoms occupy two different sites, and hence the stacking order of T and Si layers along the c axis is different in the two structures. The structural difference in the two structures is evident from Fig. 2. It is seen that the BaNiSn_{3}-type structure is not symmetric about the R plane and there is a loss of the mirror plane along the c axis in the BaNiSn_{3}-type structure which is present in the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure. The ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure is centrosymmetric, whereas the BaNiSn_{3}-type structure is noncentrosymmetric.

## IV Electrical resistivity

The electrical resistivity \rho of LaIrSi_{3} as a function of T for 0.35 K \leqslant_T_\leqslant 300 K measured at applied magnetic field H = 0 is shown in Fig. 3(a). A metallic behavior is inferred from the T dependence of \rho; \rho decreases with decreasing T, becomes nearly constant in the low-_T_ limit below 25 K, and undergoes a sharp transition to a zero-resistance state due to the occurrence of superconductivity. It is seen that the onset of superconductivity takes place at _T_c onset \approx 1.6 K, and the zero-resistivity state is reached at _T_c0  1.3 K. Thus a _T_c = 1.45 K (defined as the midpoint of the transition) is obtained from the resistivity data. The \rho(_T_) data at various H for 0 \leqslant

The solid line through the experimental points is the Rietveld refinement profile calculated for the noncentrosymmetric body-centered tetragonal BaNiSn_{3}-type structure (space group I4 mm). The short vertical bars indicate the Bragg peak positions. The lowermost curve represents the difference between the experimental and calculated intensities.

  0.4 T are shown in Fig. 3(b). It is seen that T_{\rm c} decreases with increasing H; at H=0.32 T, T_{\rm c} decreases to 0.70 K from 1.45 K at H=0.

From Fig. 3(a) the residual resistivity before entering the superconducting state is \rho_{0}=2.7\,\mu\Omega cm, and a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) \equiv\rho(300\,{\rm K})/\rho(1.6\,{\rm K})\approx 31. The low value of \rho_{0} and high value of RRR indicate good sample quality. In the normal state, the \rho(T\geqslant 1.6 K) data are well described by the Bloch-Gruneisen (BG) model of resistivity due to the scattering of conduction electrons by longitudinal acoustic lattice vibrations [45]. We fitted our normal-state \rho(T) data by

\[\rho(T)=\rho_{0}+\rho_{\rm BG},\] (1)

where

\[\rho_{\rm BG}(T/\Theta_{\rm R})=4{\cal R}\biggl{(}\frac{T}{\Theta_{\rm R}} \biggr{)}^{5}\int_{0}^{\Theta_{\rm R}/T}\frac{x^{5}}{(e^{*}-1)(1-e^{-x})}dx\] (2)

represents the BG resistivity. \Theta_{\rm R} is the Debye temperature from the resistivity data, and {\cal R} is a material-dependent prefactor.

Our fit of \rho(T) data in 1.6 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K by the BG model is shown by the solid red curve in Fig. 3(a), where we used an analytic Pade approximant fitting function for \rho_{\rm BG} from Ref. [46]. From the fitting of \rho(T) data we obtain \rho_{0}=2.81(2)\,\mu\Omega cm, \Theta_{\rm R}=331(2) K, and {\cal R}=95.7\,\mu\Omega cm. Further details about the fitting of \rho(T) using the Bloch-Gruneisen model of resistivity can be found in Refs. [46, 47].

## V. Heat Capacity

The heat capacity C_{\rm p} of LalrSi_{3} as a function of T for 0.35 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K measured at H=0 is shown in Fig. 4(a). As shown in the inset, a sharp jump is observed in C_{\rm p} due to the superconducting transition at T_{\rm c}=0.72(1) K. The observation of such a sharp jump in C_{\rm p}(T) indicates the occurrence of bulk superconductivity in LalrSi_{3}. The C_{\rm p}(T) data measured at different magnetic fields are shown in Fig. 4(b). It is seen that the jump \Delta C_{\rm p} in C_{\rm p} and T_{\rm c} decrease with the increasing H. T_{\rm c} is found to decrease to 0.44(2) K at H=5.0 mT from its value of T_{\rm c}=0.72(1) K at H=0, and it is suppressed to a temperature below 0.35 K by a field of H=7.0 mT. The suppression of T_{\rm c} with H for C_{\rm p}(T,H) is very different from that observed for the \rho(T,H) data above, where superconductivity survives even at an applied field of 0.4 T.

The low-temperature normal-state heat-capacity data are well described by C_{\rm p}(T)=\gamma_{\rm n}T+\beta T^{3}. The normal-state Sommerfeld electronic heat-capacity coefficient \gamma_{\rm n} is estimated by fitting the normal-state C_{\rm p}(T) data measured at H=0 (at 0.75 K \leqslant T\leqslant 3.8 K) and at H=10.0 mT (at 0.35 K \leqslant T\leqslant 0.9 K) simultaneously. The simultaneous linear fit of C_{\rm p}(T)\,T versus T^{2} by C_{\rm p}(T)=\gamma_{\rm n}+\beta T^{2} at 0.35 K \leqslant T\leqslant 3.8 K yields \gamma_{\rm n}=4.60(2) mJ/mol K^{2} and \beta=0.17(1) mJ/mol K^{4}. The coefficient \beta according to the relation [48]\Theta_{\rm D}=(12\pi^{4}Rp/5\beta)^{1/3}, where R is the molar gas constant and p=5 is the number of atoms per formula unit, gives the Debye temperature \Theta_{\rm D}=385(8) K. The experimental C_{\rm p}(T=300{\rm K})\approx 106 J/mol K does not reach the Dulong-Petit high-T limit of the lattice heat capacity C_{V}=3\,p\,R=15\,R=124.7 J/mol K.

The coefficient \gamma_{\rm n} can be used to estimate the density of states at the Fermi level D(E_{\rm F}), which, according to the relation [48]\gamma_{\rm n}=(\pi^{2}k_{\rm B}^{2}/3)\,\mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F}), gives \mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F})=1.95(1) states/eV f.u. for both spin directions. This \mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F}) contains the quasiparticle mass enhancement by many-body electron-phonon interaction and is related to the bare density of states \mathcal{D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F}) by [49]\mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F})=(1+\lambda_{\rm e-ph})\mathcal{D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F}), where \lambda_{\rm e-ph} is the electron-phonon coupling constant that can be estimated from \Theta_{\rm D} and T_{\rm c} using McMillan's relation [50],

\[\lambda_{\rm e-ph}=\frac{1.04+\mu^{*}\ln(\Theta_{\rm D}/1.45\,T_{\rm c})}{(1-0.6 2\mu^{*})\ln(\Theta_{\rm D}/1.45\,T_{\rm c})-1.04}.\] (3)

Here \mu^{*} is the repulsive screened Coulomb parameter usually assigned as \mu^{*}=0.13. For LalrSi_{3} we have T_{\rm c}=0.72 K and \Theta_{\rm D}=385 K, which together with \mu^{*}=0.13, according to Eq. (3), give \lambda_{\rm e-ph}=0.41. The small value of \lambda_{\rm e-ph} implies a weak-coupling superconductivity in LalrSi_{3}. This value of \lambda_{\rm e-ph} combined with \mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F})=1.95(1) states/eV f.u. for both

  spin directions gives {\cal D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})=1.38(1) states/eV f.u. for both spin directions. The effective mass m^{*} of the quasiparticle can be obtained from m^{*}=(1+\lambda_{\rm e-ph})\,m_{\rm band}^{*}, which gives m^{*}=1.41\,m_{\rm e}, assuming the effective band mass m_{\rm band}^{*}=m_{\rm e}, the free electron mass.

The density of states and hence \gamma_{\rm h} can be further used to estimate the Fermi velocity v_{\rm F}, which is related to {\cal D}(E_{\rm F}) by [48]v_{\rm F}=(\pi^{2}\hbar^{3}/m^{*2}V_{\rm f.u.}){\cal D}(E_{\rm F}), where \hbar is Planck's constant divided by 2\pi and V_{\rm f.u.}=V_{\rm cell}/2 is the volume per formula unit. We thus estimate v_{\rm F}=9.49\times 10^{7}cm/s for LalfSi_{3} using the above-estimated {\cal D}(E_{\rm F}) and m^{*}. We together with \rho_{0} can be used to estimate the mean free path \ell, as \ell=v_{\rm F}\tau, and the mean free scattering time \tau=m^{*}/ne^{2}\rho_{0}, with the conduction carrier density n=m^{*3}v_{\rm F}^{2}/3\pi^{2}\hbar^{3}, assuming a spherical Fermi surface [48]. Combining all these,

\[\ell=3\pi^{2}\biggl{(}\frac{\hbar}{e^{2}\rho_{0}}\biggr{)}\biggl{(}\frac{\hbar }{m^{*}v_{\rm F}}\biggr{)}^{2},\] (4)

which for \rho_{0}=2.7\,\mu\Omega cm and the above-estimated v_{\rm F} and m^{*} gives \ell=33.7 nm.

## VI Superconducting-state properties

The electronic contribution to the heat capacity C_{\rm e}(T) after subtracting the phonon contribution from the measured C_{\rm p}(T) data, i.e., C_{\rm e}(T)=C_{\rm p}(T)-\beta T^{3}, is shown in Fig. 4(c), which clearly shows the sharp jump in C_{\rm e} at T_{\rm c}. The jump \Delta C_{\rm e} in C_{\rm e} at T_{\rm c} is found to be \Delta C_{\rm e}=3.6(1) mJ/mol K, corresponding to the vertical dotted line at T_{\rm c} in Fig. 4(c). This gives \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c}=1.09(3) for \gamma_{\rm h}=4.60(2) mJ/mol K^{2} and T_{\rm c}=0.72(1) K, which is significantly smaller than the BCS value of \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c}=1.43 in the weak-coupling limit [51]. The presence of a residual heat capacity due to a small impurity/nonsuperconducting phase can lead to a reduced \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c}. However, in view of the fact that the jump in C_{\rm e}(T) at the superconducting transition is very sharp, the entire sample seems to be superconducting without any residual \gamma, which in turn suggests that the reduction in \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c} is intrinsic. In a single-band model, such a reduction can be caused by the presence of an anisotropic superconducting energy gap (order parameter) in momentum space [38]. That the reduction in \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c} is intrinsic will be clear from our analysis of the superconducting-state data using the single-band \alpha model of BCS superconductivity [38, 39, 40] below, which is applicable to the system with \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c}\neq 1.43.

In the so-called \alpha model of BCS superconductivity in order to fit the superconducting-state thermodynamic data, \alpha_{\rm BCS}\equiv\Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=1.764 is replaced by a variable \alpha[38, 39]. \alpha is determined from the jump \Delta C_{\rm e} at T_{\rm c} according to the relation [38]

\[\frac{\Delta C_{\rm e}(T_{\rm c})}{\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c}}=1.426\biggl{(} \frac{\alpha}{\alpha_{\rm BCS}}\biggr{)}^{2},\] (5)

which for \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c}=1.09(3) gives \alpha=1.54(2). This value of \alpha is significantly smaller than the BCS value of 1.764. The temperature dependence of \alpha-model superconducting-state heat capacity C_{\rm e}(T) calculated for \alpha=1.54 is shown by the solid red curve in Fig. 4(c) together with that of the BCS prediction for \alpha=\alpha_{\rm BCS}. A reasonable agreement is observed

  between the \alpha-model prediction and the superconducting-state C_{\rm e}(T) data, which supports the applicability of the \alpha model and in turn indicates that the s-wave order parameter of LaIrSi_{3} is anisotropic in momentum space. The details about the fitting of C_{\rm e}(T) data by the \alpha model of BCS superconductivity can be found in Refs. [38; 52]. The lack of perfect agreement between the \alpha-model prediction and the experimental data may indicate that the anisotropy of the gap is not well accounted for, as the simplified \alpha model does not account for the energy dependence of the gap function or for a complex \Delta.

The thermodynamic critical field H_{\rm c} is estimated from the zero-field C_{\rm e}(T) data by integrating the entropy difference between the superconducting and normal states [51; 53], H_{\rm c}^{2}(T)=8\pi\int_{T}^{T_{\rm c}}[S_{\rm en}(T^{\prime})-S_{\rm es}(T^ {\prime})]dT^{\prime}, where S_{\rm en} and S_{\rm es} are the electronic entropy of normal and superconducting states, respectively, with S_{\rm e}(T^{\prime})=\int_{0}^{T}[C_{\rm e}(T^{\prime\prime})/T^{\prime\prime})] dT^{\prime\prime}. H_{\rm c}(T) obtained this way from the zero-field C_{\rm e}(T) is shown in Fig. 5. The T dependence of H_{\rm c} can be approximated to the conventional relation H_{\rm c}(T)=H_{\rm c}(0)[1-(T/T_{\rm c})^{2}], which gives H_{\rm c}(0)=6.10(3) mT. The solid red curve in Fig. 5 represents the fit of H_{\rm c}(T) data with this expression.

The experimental H_{\rm c}(0) so obtained is somewhat higher than the theoretical H_{\rm c}(0), which for the \alpha model is given by [38]

\[\frac{H_{\rm c}(0)}{\left(\gamma_{\rm av}T_{\rm c}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}=\sqrt{ \frac{6}{\pi}}\;\alpha\approx 1.382\,\alpha,\] (6)

where the Sommerfeld coefficient per unit volume \gamma_{\rm av} is in units of erg/cm^{3} K^{2}. From this relation for \alpha=1.54 we obtain H_{\rm c}(0)=4.5 mT, which is a little lower than H_{\rm c}(0)=6.10(3) mT obtained above. Even for \alpha_{\rm BCS}=1.764, Eq. (6) gives a lower H_{\rm c}(0)=5.1 mT. The reason for this discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical values of H_{\rm c}(0) is not clear. We suspect that this might be the result of a nonspherical/anisotropic Fermi surface in LaIrSi_{3} which is not properly accounted by equation (6).

Further, as can be seen from Fig. 5, H_{\rm c}(T) obtained from the zero-field C_{\rm e}(T) data and the H-T phase diagram determined from the H-dependent T_{\rm c} from C_{\rm p}(T,H) data in Fig. 4(b) both give very low critical fields. For a type-II superconductivity T_{\rm c}(H) obtained from C_{\rm p}(T,H) gives the upper critical field H_{\rm c2}, which is usually much higher than the thermodynamic critical field, which is not the present case. The fact that H_{\rm c2}(T) is close to H_{\rm c}(T) may suggest a type-I superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3} or a type-I.5 behavior that may arise from the presence of split spin-up and spin-down energy bands similar to what has been observed in two-band superconductor MgB_{2}[54].

The H-dependent T_{\rm c} from \rho(T,H) data in Fig. 3(b) is shown in the inset of Fig. 5, which shows a very different behavior than T_{\rm c}(H) from C_{\rm p}(T,H) data. This is consistent with the observation of different T_{\rm c} in resistivity and heat-capacity measurements in zero field mentioned above, apparently due to the filamentary/surface superconductivity that sets in at a temperature higher than the bulk superconductivity. Our estimate of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa below gives \kappa=0.55, which suggests a type-I behavior. Usually, for a type-I superconductor we do not expect a filamentary or surface superconductivity. However, surface superconductivity is predicted for a type-I superconductor with \kappa values between 1/\surd 2 and 1/2.39[55; 56]. Indeed, our estimated \kappa lies between these limits, and we can expect a surface superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3}. The critical field associated with the surface superconductivity is given by [55; 56]H_{\rm c3}=2.39\,\kappa\,H_{\rm c}; accordingly, for LaIrSi_{3} we estimate H_{\rm c3}=8.0 mT, which is much smaller than the observed upper critical field from the resistivity measurement (inset of Fig. 5). Thus the observed T_{\rm c}(H) from \rho(T,H) could not be understood to arise from surface superconductivity. The reason for such a high critical field in the resistivity measurement of LaIrSi_{3} is not clear. The type-I superconductor LaPdSi_{3} was also found to exhibit a higher critical field in the resistivity measurement compared to that in the heat capacity [31]. In a recent study Kimura _et al._[57] found a similar high critical field from the resistivity measurement on the type-I superconductor LaRhSi_{3}, and they argue that this behavior may be a common feature in noncentrosymmetric superconductors. However, we are not aware of any theoretical discussion of this aspect of noncentrosymmetric superconductors, and this hypothesis needs to be tested theoretically.

Our estimate of the superconducting London penetration depth in the clean limit at T=0, \lambda_{\rm L}(0) from v_{\rm F} using the relation [51]

\[\lambda_{\rm L}(0)^{2}=\frac{m^{*}c^{2}}{4\pi n\varepsilon^{2}}=\frac{3\pi c^{ 2}h^{3}}{4m^{*2}\varepsilon^{2}v_{\rm F}^{3}},\] (7)

where c is the speed of light in vacuum, gives \lambda_{\rm L}(0)=25.9 nm for v_{\rm F}=9.49\times 10^{7} cm/s. The BCS coherence length \xi_{0} can be obtained from v_{\rm F} and the energy gap \Delta(0), which for the \alpha model is given by [38]

\[\xi_{0}=\frac{\hbar v_{\rm F}}{\pi\,\Delta(0)}=\left(\frac{1}{\pi\alpha}\right) \frac{\hbar v_{\rm F}}{k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}}.\] (8)

Figure 5: (Color online) Thermodynamic critical field H_{\rm c} of LaIrSi_{3} as a function of temperature T obtained from the experimental electronic heat capacity C_{\rm e}(T) data. The H-dependent T_{\rm c} obtained from the heat capacity C_{\rm p}(T,H) data in Fig. 4(b) are also shown by open squares. The solid line represents the parabolic fit to H_{\rm c}(T)=H_{\rm c}(0)[1-(T/T_{\rm c})^{2}], as discussed in the text. Inset: H-T phase diagram obtained from the electrical resistivity \rho(T,H) in Fig. 3(b) together with T_{\rm c}(H) from C_{\rm p}(T,H).

  This gives \xi_{0}=2081 nm for \alpha=1.54 and v_{\rm F}=9.49\times 10^{7}cm/s. We see that \xi_{0} is much larger than the above-estimated mean free path \ell=33.7 nm, \ell/\xi_{0}\approx 0.016\ll 1, suggesting that the superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3} is in the dirty limit. In the dirty limit, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa_{\rm GL}=0.715\,\lambda_{\rm L}(0)/\ell[51], which gives \kappa_{\rm GL}=0.55<1/\surd 2, as expected for a type-I superconductivity. This value of \kappa_{\rm GL} is close to the value obtained using the dirty-limit relation for a fully gapped (isotropic) superconductor [58], \kappa_{\rm GL}=7.49\times 10^{3}\,\rho_{0}/\gamma_{\rm av}, with \rho_{0} in \Omega cm, which gives \kappa_{\rm GL}=0.59. Both estimates of \kappa_{\rm GL} consistently indicate a type-I superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3}.

The effective magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{\rm eff} can be estimated using the relation [51]

\[\lambda_{\rm eff}(0)=\lambda_{\rm L}(0)\sqrt{1+\frac{\xi_{0}}{\ell}}\qquad( \rm dirty\ limit),\] (9)

which gives \lambda_{\rm eff}(0)=205 nm. Then, using the relation \kappa_{\rm GL}=\lambda_{\rm eff}(0)/\xi(0), we estimate the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length \xi(0), which for \kappa_{\rm GL}=0.55 yields \xi(0)=373 nm. The measured and derived superconducting parameters of LaIrSi_{3} are listed in Table 2.

## VII Muon spin relaxation and rotation

The time evolution of muon spin relaxation in zero field (ZF) is shown in Fig. 6 for T both above and below the bulk T_{\rm c}. It is evident from the ZF \muSR spectra that there is no noticeable change in the relaxation rates at 1.0 K (>T_{\rm c}) and 0.05 K (<T_{\rm c}). This indicates that the time-reversal symmetry remains preserved upon entering the superconducting state. The ZF \muSR spectra are best described by the Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe function,

\[G_{z}(t)=A_{0}\big{[}\tfrac{1}{3}+\tfrac{2}{3}(1-\sigma^{2}t^{2})e^{-\sigma^{2 }t^{2}/2}\big{]}e^{-\lambda t}+A_{\rm BG},\] (10)

where A_{0} is the initial asymmetry, \sigma and \lambda are the depolarization rates, and A_{\rm BG} is the time-independent background contribution. \sigma accounts for the Gaussian distribution of static fields from nuclear moments (the local field distribution width \langle H_{\mu}\rangle=\sigma/\gamma_{\mu}, with muon gyromagnetic ratio \gamma_{\mu}=135.53 MHz/T), and \lambda accounts for the electronic moments. The fits of \muSR spectra in Fig. 6 by the decay function in Eq. (10) give \sigma=0.074(1)\mus^{-1} and \lambda=0.009(3)\mus^{-1} at 1.0 K and \sigma=0.074(1)\mus^{-1} and \lambda=0.011(2)\mus^{-1} at 0.05 K. The fits are shown by the solid red curve in Fig. 6. Since within the error bars both \sigma and \lambda at T<T_{\rm c} and T>T_{\rm c} are similar, there is no evidence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in LaIrSi_{3}.

The time evolution of muon spin rotation in transverse field (TF) is shown in Fig. 7. The TF muon spin precession signals were collected on a field-cooled sample at different applied fields both above (1.0 K) and below (0.05 K) T_{\rm c}. The TF \muSR spectra are best described by an oscillatory function damped with a Gaussian and an oscillatory background, i.e., by

\[G_{z}(t)=A_{0}\cos(\omega t+\varphi)e^{-\sigma^{2}t^{2}/2}+A_{\rm BG}\cos( \omega t+\varphi),\] (11)

where \omega=\gamma_{\mu}H_{\rm int} is the precession frequency (H_{\rm int} is the internal field at the muon site). Solid curves in Fig. 7 are the fits of the TF \muSR spectra by the decay function in Eq. (11). In the superconducting state at T=0.05 K the depolarization rate is found to increase significantly; for example, for the TF \muSR spectra at 2.5 mT, \sigma increases from its value \sigma=0.010(2)\mus^{-1} at 1.0 K to \sigma=1.45(4)\mus^{-1} at 0.05 K. Such an increase of the depolarization rate reveals bulk superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3}.

The maximum entropy spectra for TF \muSR precession at 1.0 and 0.05 K are shown in Fig. 8. The maximum entropy spectra depict the magnetic field probability distribution P(H). It is clear from Fig. 8 that at 1.0 K (in the normal state) sharp peaks are observed at H_{\rm int} exactly equal to the applied H, whereas at 0.05 K (in the superconducting state) one can see additional peaks. At H=4.0 mT, P(H) at 0.05 K shows an additional peak at H_{\rm int}>H (inset of Fig. 8). The appearance of an additional peak (near 5.5 mT, which gives an estimation of H_{\rm c}) at an internal field greater than the applied H is a characteristic

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l r} \hline Parameter & Value \\ \hline T_{\rm c} (K) & 0.72(1) \\ \gamma_{\rm a} (mJ/mol K^{2}) & 4.60(2) \\ \Theta_{\rm D} (K) & 385(8) \\ \lambda_{\rm a-ph} & 0.41 \\ \Delta C_{\rm e} (mJ/mol K) & 3.6(1) \\ \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm av}T_{\rm c} & 1.09(3) \\ \omega=\Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c} (from \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm b}T_{\rm c}) & 1.54(2) \\ \Delta(0)/k_{\rm B} (K) & 1.11 \\ H_{\rm c}(T=0) (mT) & 6.10(3) \\ \kappa_{\rm GL} & 0.55 \\ \xi(0) (mm) & 373 \\ \xi_{0} (mm) & 2081 \\ \ell (mm) & 33.7 \\ \lambda_{\rm L}(0)  of a type-I behavior and indicates a type-I superconductivity in LalrSi_{3} consistent with the above inference from the value of \kappa_{\rm GL} in Table 2. Further at 0.05 K for H\leqslant 4.0 mT we also observe an increase in P(H) near H_{\rm int}\sim 0.5 mT, as is expected for a sample in the Meissner state.

However, no such increase in P(H) is observed from the Meissner volume in the intermediate state (i.e., at H=5.0 mT). At H=6.0 mT no additional peak is observed in P(H) at H_{\rm int}>H even on an expanded scale. This could be understood to be due to the fact that the applied H is close to H_{c}=6.1 mT (see Table 2) and the sample is on the verge of a transition from a superconducting to a normal state at H=6.0 mT. Thus the \muSR data also reflect a low thermodynamic critical field H_{c}\approx 5.5 mT, in line with the estimate of H_{c} from the heat-capacity data.

## VIII Conclusions

The superconducting and normal-state properties of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor LaIrSi_{3}, which crystallizes in a BaNiSn_{3}-type tetragonal crystal structure (space group I4 _mm_), were investigated using \mathcal{C}_{\rm p}(T,H), \rho(T,H), and \muSR measurements which demonstrate bulk BCS superconductivity below T_{c}=0.72(1) K. A nonbulk superconductivity sets in at a higher T_{c} in \rho(T). In the normal state \rho exhibits metallic behavior, and \rho(T\geqslant 1.6 K) is well described by the Bloch-Gruneisen model of resistivity. Our analysis of low-temperature normal-state C_{\rm p}(T) data yields a Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma_{\rm n}=4.60(2) mJ/mol K^{2}, corresponding to the density of states at Fermi energy \mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F})=1.95(1) states/eV f.u. for both spin directions.

The superconducting transition is revealed by a very sharp jump in C_{\rm p} at T_{\rm c}=0.72(1) K, however, with a value of \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c}=1.09(3) lower than the BCS expected value of 1.43. The reduced value of \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c} seems to indicate an anisotropic energy gap in LaIrSi_{3}. The superconducting-state electronic heat-capacity data are analyzed by the single-band \alpha model of BCS superconductivity that describes the experimental data reasonably. \alpha=\Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=1.54(2) obtained from the jump in C_{\rm p} is smaller than \alpha_{\rm BCS}=1.764, indicating the s-wave order parameter of LaIrSi_{3} is anisotropic in momentum space. Even though the single-band \alpha model describes the superconducting-state data reasonably, considering the split spin-up and spin-down bands in LaIrSi_{3}, the possibility of two-band superconductivity cannot be ruled out. The presence of two bands is also known to result in a reduced \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c}[38; 59]. Since the two-band effect and an anisotropy modification to a single band have similar manifestations, it is very difficult to distinguish between them by examining the thermodynamic quantities. Recently, a two-band superconductivity with equal energy gaps was reported in SrPt_{3}P [60]. Further investigations are desired to check for the possibility of a similar two-band single-gap superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3}.

Various normal- and superconducting-state parameters have been estimated which indicate a dirty-limit weak-coupling type-I s-wave BCS superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3}. Type-I superconductivity is further confirmed by \muSR. The \muSR measurement also revealed that the time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the superconducting state, thus confirming a conventional s-wave singlet pairing superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3}. Thus, despite a large splitting of Fermi surfaces due to antisymmetric coupling on account of the noncentrosymmetric structure inferred from the de Haas-van Alphen effect study [33], no clear signature of parity mixing or a

  spin-triplet pairing state is found in our investigations of the superconducting-state properties of LaIrSi_{3}.

The type-I superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3} is similar to that of NCS LaRhSi_{3}, which also exhibits conventional s-wave electron-phonon-mediated type-I superconductivity with preserved time-reversal symmetry and a singlet pairing [26]. LaRhSi_{3} and LaIrSi_{3} have similar \mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F}) and \Theta_{\rm D}; therefore one would expect the T_{\rm c} of these two compounds to be similar; however, we see that T_{\rm c}=0.72(1) K for LaIrSi_{3} is significantly lower than T_{\rm c}=2.16(8) K for LaRhSi_{3}[26]. While the reason for this contrasting behavior is not clear, T_{\rm c} appears to have a relation with the outer-shell electronic configuration of Rh (4d) and Ir (5d) in these two superconductors. A similar trend has been observed in other 4d and 5d systems, such as in LaPdSi_{3} [T_{\rm c}=2.65(5) K] and LaPtSi_{3} [T_{\rm c}=1.52(6) K] [31] as well as in Li_{2}Pd_{3}B [T_{\rm c}=6.7 K] and Li_{2}Pt_{3}B [T_{\rm c}=2.43 K] [11]. The 4d-based superconductors appear to have higher T_{\rm c} than those with 5d. Further investigations to understand this aspect of superconductivity in these compounds are desired.

The effect of the lack of inversion symmetry on the superconducting properties of LaIrSi_{3} does not seem to be pronounced despite a large splitting of spin-up and spin-down energy bands due to ASOC. Similar behavior is reported for NCS BaPtSi_{3}[21], for which electronic-structure calculations revealed the splitting of bands because of spin-orbit interactions; however, the superconductivity turned out to be conventional BCS-like with a singlet paring. Such observations raise an important question: what else besides ASOC controls the appearance of anomalous superconducting state in a noncentrosymmetric system? The anomalous superconducting properties of the Ce-based strongly correlated NCSs, such as CePt_{3}Si [9], CeRhSi_{3}[13], and CeIrSi_{3}[14] can naively be related to the magnetic pairing due to the presence of 4f moments. However, the unusual superconducting properties of weakly correlated NCSs Li_{2}Pt_{3}B [11], LaNiC_{2}[19, 20], and Re_{6}Zr [30] are not then obvious as they do not show any evidence of magnetic order. An important difference between the two groups of nonmagnetic NCSs, i.e., those exhibiting unusual superconducting properties and those exhibiting conventional superconductivity, is the difference in their crystal structures/space groups. This may suggest that these two groups of nonmagnetic NCSs may have different Fermi surface topologies that may have some role in realizing the effect of ASOC. A comparative study of the extent of ASOC in nonmagnetic NCSs, preferably by a technique that can directly probe Fermi surface topology, such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, complemented with band-structure calculations can shed light on this issue and would be of help in understanding the relationship between ASOC, Fermi surface topology, and anomalous superconductivity in NCSs.

###### Abstract

The results of heat capacity C_{\rm p}(T,H) and electrical resistivity \rho(T,H) measurements down to 0.35 K as well as muon spin relaxation and rotation (\muSR) measurements on the noncentrosymmetric superconductor LaIrSi_{3} are presented. Powder neutron diffraction confirmed the reported noncentrosymmetric body-centered tetragonal BaNiSi_{3}-type structure (space group _14 mm_) of LaIrSi_{3}. The bulk superconductivity is observed below T_{\rm c}=0.72(1) K. The intrinsic \Delta C_{\rm c}/\gamma_{\rm z}T_{\rm c}=1.09(3) is significantly smaller than the BCS value of 1.43, and this reduction is accounted for by the \alpha model of BCS superconductivity. The analysis of the superconducting-state C_{\rm c}(T) data by the single-band \alpha model indicates a moderately anisotropic order parameter with the s-wave gap \Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=1.54(2), which is lower than the BCS value of 1.764. Our estimates of various normal- and superconducting-state parameters indicate a weakly coupled electron-phonon-driven type-I s-wave superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3}. The \muSR results also confirm the conventional type-I superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3} with a preserved time-reversal symmetry and hence a singlet pairing superconducting ground state.

## I Introduction

The noncentrosymmetric superconductors (NCSs) that allow mixing between spin-singlet and spin-triplet parity and exhibit exotic superconducting properties through the antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling (ASOC) are of great interest in current research activities on superconductivity [1]. The NCSs lack inversion symmetry in their crystal structure, which leads to a nonuniform lattice potential and hence introduces an antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling. The ASOC removes the spin degeneracy of conduction-band electrons; that is, the spin-up and spin-down energy bands split, and the two electrons forming a Cooper pair no longer belong to the _same_ Fermi surface as in the conventional superconductors. An important consequence of Cooper pair formation by the electrons belonging to two _different_ Fermi surfaces of spin-up and spin-down bands is that the Cooper pair wave function of NCSs can no longer be classified by its parity as a pure spin-singlet or spin-triplet pairing, instead results in a parity mixing of spin singlet-triplet states [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. For centrosymmetric superconductors to which most of the known superconductors belong the spin-up and spin-down energy bands of the conduction electrons are degenerate when time-reversal symmetry is conserved. The structural inversion symmetry thus has a key role in determining the superconducting properties, and a number of unusual phenomena can be observed in such noncentrosymmetric materials [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

First such unusual superconducting behavior was observed in the heavy-fermion superconductor CePt_{3}Si, which crystallizes in a tetragonal structure (space group P4 _mm_) that lacks mirror symmetry along the c axis and undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition below T_{\rm N}=2.2 K and becomes superconducting at the critical temperature T_{\rm c}=0.75 K that coexists with antiferromagnetic ordering [7]. The upper critical field H_{\rm c2}\approx 5 T is very high compared to the Pauli paramagnetic limiting field of \sim1 T, indicating a spin-triplet pairing [7]. For a spin-singlet paring, Pauli paramagnetic limiting is expected. On the other hand, for a system without inversion symmetry spin-triplet pairing is not permitted [1]. These contradicting situations are accounted for by mixed spin singlet-triplet states of the order parameter [6]. The irreducible representation point group for the tetragonal structure of CePt_{3}Si is C_{4v}, in which Rashba-type ASOC exists, which provides the key to understanding the intriguing superconducting behavior of CePt_{3}Si [7, 8, 9]. Following CePt_{3}Si many NCSs have been identified that present interesting superconducting properties, including Li_{2}(Pd,Pt)_{3}B [10, 11], CeRhSi_{3}[12, 13], CeIrSi_{3}[14, 15], CeCoGe_{3}[15, 16], CeIrGe_{3}[17], LaNiC_{2}[18, 19, 20], BaPtSi_{3}[21], (Rh,Ir)Ga_{9}[22, 23], Mg_{10}Ir_{19}B_{16}[24], Mo_{3}Al_{2}C [25], LaRhSi_{3}[26], Ca(Ir,Pt)Si_{3}[27], Re_{3}W [28], Nb_{0.18}Fe_{0.12}[29], Re_{6}Zr [30], La(Pd,Pt)Si_{3}[31], Ca_{3}Ir_{4}Ge_{4}[32], etc.

The Ce-based NCSs CeRhSi_{3}, CeIrSi_{3}, CeCoGe_{3}, and CeIrGe_{3} crystallize with BaNiSn_{3}-type tetragonal structure (space group _14 mm_), which lacks mirror plane symmetry along the c axis and belongs to the same point group, C_{4v}, as CePt_{3}Si. Thus, like CePt_{3}Si, a Rashba-type ASOC is present in these CeMX_{3} compounds too, leading to an exotic superconducting ground state in them [12, 13, 14, 17, 33, 34, 35]. Like CePt_{3}Si, they also exhibit heavy-fermion behavior and undergo a long-range antiferromagnetic ordering; however, they become superconducting only under the application of pressure [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. The above-mentioned Ce-based NCSs are situated close to a magnetic quantum critical point, making it difficult to explore the effects of ASOC and inversion symmetry breaking on superconductivity. Therefore nonmagnetic Rashba-type NCSs are essential for understanding the effect and extent of ASOC on the superconducting properties of these Ce-based NCSs. The reported nonmagnetic AMX_{3} NCSs with BaNiSn_{3}-type tetragonal structure include BaPtSi_{3} (T_{\rm c}=2.25 K), LaRhSi_{3} [T_{\rm c}=2.16(8) K], CaIrSi_{3} (T_{\rm c}=3.6 K), CaPtSi_{3} (T_{\rm c}=2.3 K), LaPdSi_{3} [T_{\rm c}=2.65(5) K], and LaPtSi_{3} [T_{\rm c}=1.52(6) K] [21, 26, 27, 31]. All these nonmagnetic NCSs behave like a conventional s-wave superconductor without any noticeable effect from the absence of inversion symmetry in their crystal structure. Nevertheless, being isostructural, they provide a direct comparison with CeMX_{3} NCSs and the investigations of these nonmagnetic NCSs connote the role of 4f moments in Ce NCSs. One important difference between the CeMX_{3} NCSs and these nonmagnetic NCSs is that CeMX_{3} exhibit superconductivity only at high pressures, whereas these nonmagnetic NCSs superconduct at ambient pressure. This difference may have its origin in magnetic pairing in Ce NCSs in contrast to phonon-mediated superconductivity in these nonmagnetic NCSs.

Theoretically, the Rashba-type ASOC has been studied extensively and is favored for investigations of NCSs; therefore compounds with tetragonal BaNiSn_{3}-type structure represent an important class of noncentrosymmetric materials. Continuing our work on BaNiSn_{3}-type structured materials, we have performed a comprehensive study of superconducting- and normal-state properties of NCS LaIrSi_{3} using heat capacity C_{\rm p} and electrical resistivity \rho versus temperature T measurements down to 0.35 K and muon spin relaxation and rotation (\muSR) measurements down to 50 mK. The reported noncentrosymmetric body-centered tetragonal BaNiSn_{3}-type structure of LaIrSi_{3} is confirmed by our room-temperature powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) and neutron diffraction. Superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3} was reported about 30 years ago with T_{\rm c} between 1.9 and 2.7 K based on resistivity measurement [36, 37]. In a recent study Okuda _et al._ reported a superconducting transition at T_{\rm c}=0.77 K from the heat-capacity measurement on LaIrSi_{3}[33]. Okuda _et al._ also carried out a de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect study and found that as a result of Rashba-type ASOC the Fermi surface of LaIrSi_{3} splits into two Fermi surfaces (spin-up and spin-down energy bands), which are separated by about 1000 K [33]. In our recent investigations of superconducting properties of NCS LaRhSi_{3} we found a conventional type-I superconductivity with preserved time-reversal symmetry, however, with an unusual exponential evolution of the Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma with magnetic field which could be due to the reinforcement of ASOC with magnetic field [26]. Therefore in view of the unusual behavior of LaRhSi_{3} and the strong effect of ASOC in LaIrSi_{3} revealed by the dHvA effect study, it was felt necessary to investigate the superconducting properties of LaIrSi_{3} in detail, which we present in this paper.

Our C_{\rm p}(T) data confirm bulk superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3} below T_{\rm c}=0.72(1) K, in agreement with the report by Okuda _et al._[33]. However, \rho(T) exhibits superconductivity at a higher T_{\rm c}=1.45 K, apparently due to filamentary nonbulk superconductivity. The normal-state \rho is metallic and well described by the Bloch-Gruneisen model of resistivity for T\geqslant 1.6 K. The low-T normal-state C_{\rm p}(T) gives an electronic coefficient \gamma_{\rm n}=4.60(2) mJ/mol K^{2} and a density of states at Fermi energy \mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F})=1.95(1) states/eV f.u. for both spin directions, where f.u. stands for formula unit. A sharp jump is observed at T_{\rm c}=0.72(1) K in electronic heat capacity C_{\rm s}(T), with \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c}=1.09(3), which is smaller than the BCS expected value of 1.43. Within the single-band picture the reduced value of \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c} can be attributed to an anisotropic energy gap in LaIrSi_{3}. We have analyzed the superconducting-state electronic heat-capacity data using the \alpha model of BCS superconductivity [38, 39, 40], which suggests that the s-wave order parameter of LaIrSi_{3} is anisotropic in momentum space, with an energy gap \Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=1.54(2). We have estimated various normal- and superconducting-state parameters that indicate a weak-coupling type-I BCS superconductivity in the dirty limit. Our \muSR investigations also confirm type-I superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3}. Further, \muSR results also show that the time-reversal symmetry is preserved as is expected for a conventional s-wave singlet pairing superconductivity. No evidence of parity mixing is observed as one would have expected in view of splitting of spin-up and spin-down energy bands revealed by dHvA study [33].

## II Experimental details

A polycrystalline sample of LaIrSi_{3} was prepared by the standard arc melting of a stoichiometric mixture of high-purity elements (La: 99.9%, Ir: 99.99%, Si: 99.999%) on a water-cooled copper hearth under the titanium-gettered inert argon atmosphere with several flips to ensure homogeneity. The arc-melted sample was further heat treated at 900 ^{\circ}C for a week under the dynamic vacuum. The crystal structure was determined by the powder XRD using Cu K_{\alpha} radiation. The heat-capacity measurements were performed by the relaxation method with a physical properties measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design, Inc.). The electrical resistivity measurements were performed by the standard four-probe ac technique using the PPMS. Temperatures down to 0.35 K were attained using a ^{3}He attachment to the PPMS.

Powder neutron diffraction (ND) measurement was performed at room temperature using the ROTAX diffractometer at the ISIS facility of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Didcot, United Kingdom. The \muSR measurements were carried out using the MuSR spectrometer at the ISIS facility with the detectors in both longitudinal and transverse configurations. A high-purity-silver plate was used to mount the sample, which gives only a nonrelaxing muon signal. The powdered sample was mounted on silver plate using diluted GE varnish that was covered with Kapton film. Temperatures down to 50 mK were achieved by cooling the sample in a dilution refrigerator. Correction coils were used to counter the effect of the stray fields at the sample position to within 1 \muT.

## III Crystallography

The room-temperature powder XRD data were analyzed by structural Rietveld refinement using the program fullprof[41]. The refinement confirmed the reported BaNiSn_{3}  type tetragonal structure (space group I4 mm) of LaIrSi_{3} and revealed the single-phase nature of the sample without any trace of the impurity phase. The single-phase nature of the whole bulk of the sample is further inferred from the Rietveld refinement of room-temperature powder neutron diffraction data that was performed using the program gsas[42]. The neutron diffraction pattern and refinement profile for the noncentrosymmetric body-centered tetragonal BaNiSn_{3}-type structure are shown in Fig. 1. While refining, no improvement in the fit quality was observed upon refining the occupancies of atomic positions, and within the error bars the atomic occupancies were found to be unity; therefore in the final refinement we fixed the occupancies to unity. The crystallographic parameters obtained from the refinement of powder neutron diffraction are listed in Table 1. Both ND and XRD data gave similar crystallographic parameters and agree well with the literature values [36, 43].

The BaNiSn_{3}-type body-centered tetragonal structure (space group I4 mm) of LaIrSi_{3} is illustrated in Fig. 2 and is compared with the common ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type body-centered tetragonal structure (space group I4/mmm). Like the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure, the BaNiSn_{3}-type structure is also a layered structure and a ternary derivative of BaAl_{4}-type structure [44]. The R (La, Th) atoms occupy identical positions in both structures and form a body-centered tetragonal sublattice. However, they differ in the positions of T (Ir, Cr) and Si atoms. The T atoms form a square sublattice in the _ab_ plane in both structures, but they are rotated by 45^{\circ} in the _ab_ plane with respect to each other. Further, in the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure all the Si atoms occupy a single crystallographic site, whereas in the BaNiSn_{3}-type structure the Si atoms occupy two different sites, and hence the stacking order of T and Si layers along the c axis is different in the two structures. The structural difference in the two structures is evident from Fig. 2. It is seen that the BaNiSn_{3}-type structure is not symmetric about the R plane and there is a loss of the mirror plane along the c axis in the BaNiSn_{3}-type structure which is present in the ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure. The ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type structure is centrosymmetric, whereas the BaNiSn_{3}-type structure is noncentrosymmetric.

## IV Electrical resistivity

The electrical resistivity \rho of LaIrSi_{3} as a function of T for 0.35 K \leqslant_T_\leqslant 300 K measured at applied magnetic field H = 0 is shown in Fig. 3(a). A metallic behavior is inferred from the T dependence of \rho; \rho decreases with decreasing T, becomes nearly constant in the low-_T_ limit below 25 K, and undergoes a sharp transition to a zero-resistance state due to the occurrence of superconductivity. It is seen that the onset of superconductivity takes place at _T_c onset \approx 1.6 K, and the zero-resistivity state is reached at _T_c0  1.3 K. Thus a _T_c = 1.45 K (defined as the midpoint of the transition) is obtained from the resistivity data. The \rho(_T_) data at various H for 0 \leqslant

The solid line through the experimental points is the Rietveld refinement profile calculated for the noncentrosymmetric body-centered tetragonal BaNiSn_{3}-type structure (space group I4 mm). The short vertical bars indicate the Bragg peak positions. The lowermost curve represents the difference between the experimental and calculated intensities.

  0.4 T are shown in Fig. 3(b). It is seen that T_{\rm c} decreases with increasing H; at H=0.32 T, T_{\rm c} decreases to 0.70 K from 1.45 K at H=0.

From Fig. 3(a) the residual resistivity before entering the superconducting state is \rho_{0}=2.7\,\mu\Omega cm, and a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) \equiv\rho(300\,{\rm K})/\rho(1.6\,{\rm K})\approx 31. The low value of \rho_{0} and high value of RRR indicate good sample quality. In the normal state, the \rho(T\geqslant 1.6 K) data are well described by the Bloch-Gruneisen (BG) model of resistivity due to the scattering of conduction electrons by longitudinal acoustic lattice vibrations [45]. We fitted our normal-state \rho(T) data by

\[\rho(T)=\rho_{0}+\rho_{\rm BG},\] (1)

where

\[\rho_{\rm BG}(T/\Theta_{\rm R})=4{\cal R}\biggl{(}\frac{T}{\Theta_{\rm R}} \biggr{)}^{5}\int_{0}^{\Theta_{\rm R}/T}\frac{x^{5}}{(e^{*}-1)(1-e^{-x})}dx\] (2)

represents the BG resistivity. \Theta_{\rm R} is the Debye temperature from the resistivity data, and {\cal R} is a material-dependent prefactor.

Our fit of \rho(T) data in 1.6 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K by the BG model is shown by the solid red curve in Fig. 3(a), where we used an analytic Pade approximant fitting function for \rho_{\rm BG} from Ref. [46]. From the fitting of \rho(T) data we obtain \rho_{0}=2.81(2)\,\mu\Omega cm, \Theta_{\rm R}=331(2) K, and {\cal R}=95.7\,\mu\Omega cm. Further details about the fitting of \rho(T) using the Bloch-Gruneisen model of resistivity can be found in Refs. [46, 47].

## V. Heat Capacity

The heat capacity C_{\rm p} of LalrSi_{3} as a function of T for 0.35 K \leqslant T\leqslant 300 K measured at H=0 is shown in Fig. 4(a). As shown in the inset, a sharp jump is observed in C_{\rm p} due to the superconducting transition at T_{\rm c}=0.72(1) K. The observation of such a sharp jump in C_{\rm p}(T) indicates the occurrence of bulk superconductivity in LalrSi_{3}. The C_{\rm p}(T) data measured at different magnetic fields are shown in Fig. 4(b). It is seen that the jump \Delta C_{\rm p} in C_{\rm p} and T_{\rm c} decrease with the increasing H. T_{\rm c} is found to decrease to 0.44(2) K at H=5.0 mT from its value of T_{\rm c}=0.72(1) K at H=0, and it is suppressed to a temperature below 0.35 K by a field of H=7.0 mT. The suppression of T_{\rm c} with H for C_{\rm p}(T,H) is very different from that observed for the \rho(T,H) data above, where superconductivity survives even at an applied field of 0.4 T.

The low-temperature normal-state heat-capacity data are well described by C_{\rm p}(T)=\gamma_{\rm n}T+\beta T^{3}. The normal-state Sommerfeld electronic heat-capacity coefficient \gamma_{\rm n} is estimated by fitting the normal-state C_{\rm p}(T) data measured at H=0 (at 0.75 K \leqslant T\leqslant 3.8 K) and at H=10.0 mT (at 0.35 K \leqslant T\leqslant 0.9 K) simultaneously. The simultaneous linear fit of C_{\rm p}(T)\,T versus T^{2} by C_{\rm p}(T)=\gamma_{\rm n}+\beta T^{2} at 0.35 K \leqslant T\leqslant 3.8 K yields \gamma_{\rm n}=4.60(2) mJ/mol K^{2} and \beta=0.17(1) mJ/mol K^{4}. The coefficient \beta according to the relation [48]\Theta_{\rm D}=(12\pi^{4}Rp/5\beta)^{1/3}, where R is the molar gas constant and p=5 is the number of atoms per formula unit, gives the Debye temperature \Theta_{\rm D}=385(8) K. The experimental C_{\rm p}(T=300{\rm K})\approx 106 J/mol K does not reach the Dulong-Petit high-T limit of the lattice heat capacity C_{V}=3\,p\,R=15\,R=124.7 J/mol K.

The coefficient \gamma_{\rm n} can be used to estimate the density of states at the Fermi level D(E_{\rm F}), which, according to the relation [48]\gamma_{\rm n}=(\pi^{2}k_{\rm B}^{2}/3)\,\mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F}), gives \mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F})=1.95(1) states/eV f.u. for both spin directions. This \mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F}) contains the quasiparticle mass enhancement by many-body electron-phonon interaction and is related to the bare density of states \mathcal{D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F}) by [49]\mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F})=(1+\lambda_{\rm e-ph})\mathcal{D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F}), where \lambda_{\rm e-ph} is the electron-phonon coupling constant that can be estimated from \Theta_{\rm D} and T_{\rm c} using McMillan's relation [50],

\[\lambda_{\rm e-ph}=\frac{1.04+\mu^{*}\ln(\Theta_{\rm D}/1.45\,T_{\rm c})}{(1-0.6 2\mu^{*})\ln(\Theta_{\rm D}/1.45\,T_{\rm c})-1.04}.\] (3)

Here \mu^{*} is the repulsive screened Coulomb parameter usually assigned as \mu^{*}=0.13. For LalrSi_{3} we have T_{\rm c}=0.72 K and \Theta_{\rm D}=385 K, which together with \mu^{*}=0.13, according to Eq. (3), give \lambda_{\rm e-ph}=0.41. The small value of \lambda_{\rm e-ph} implies a weak-coupling superconductivity in LalrSi_{3}. This value of \lambda_{\rm e-ph} combined with \mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F})=1.95(1) states/eV f.u. for both

  spin directions gives {\cal D}_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})=1.38(1) states/eV f.u. for both spin directions. The effective mass m^{*} of the quasiparticle can be obtained from m^{*}=(1+\lambda_{\rm e-ph})\,m_{\rm band}^{*}, which gives m^{*}=1.41\,m_{\rm e}, assuming the effective band mass m_{\rm band}^{*}=m_{\rm e}, the free electron mass.

The density of states and hence \gamma_{\rm h} can be further used to estimate the Fermi velocity v_{\rm F}, which is related to {\cal D}(E_{\rm F}) by [48]v_{\rm F}=(\pi^{2}\hbar^{3}/m^{*2}V_{\rm f.u.}){\cal D}(E_{\rm F}), where \hbar is Planck's constant divided by 2\pi and V_{\rm f.u.}=V_{\rm cell}/2 is the volume per formula unit. We thus estimate v_{\rm F}=9.49\times 10^{7}cm/s for LalfSi_{3} using the above-estimated {\cal D}(E_{\rm F}) and m^{*}. We together with \rho_{0} can be used to estimate the mean free path \ell, as \ell=v_{\rm F}\tau, and the mean free scattering time \tau=m^{*}/ne^{2}\rho_{0}, with the conduction carrier density n=m^{*3}v_{\rm F}^{2}/3\pi^{2}\hbar^{3}, assuming a spherical Fermi surface [48]. Combining all these,

\[\ell=3\pi^{2}\biggl{(}\frac{\hbar}{e^{2}\rho_{0}}\biggr{)}\biggl{(}\frac{\hbar }{m^{*}v_{\rm F}}\biggr{)}^{2},\] (4)

which for \rho_{0}=2.7\,\mu\Omega cm and the above-estimated v_{\rm F} and m^{*} gives \ell=33.7 nm.

## VI Superconducting-state properties

The electronic contribution to the heat capacity C_{\rm e}(T) after subtracting the phonon contribution from the measured C_{\rm p}(T) data, i.e., C_{\rm e}(T)=C_{\rm p}(T)-\beta T^{3}, is shown in Fig. 4(c), which clearly shows the sharp jump in C_{\rm e} at T_{\rm c}. The jump \Delta C_{\rm e} in C_{\rm e} at T_{\rm c} is found to be \Delta C_{\rm e}=3.6(1) mJ/mol K, corresponding to the vertical dotted line at T_{\rm c} in Fig. 4(c). This gives \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c}=1.09(3) for \gamma_{\rm h}=4.60(2) mJ/mol K^{2} and T_{\rm c}=0.72(1) K, which is significantly smaller than the BCS value of \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c}=1.43 in the weak-coupling limit [51]. The presence of a residual heat capacity due to a small impurity/nonsuperconducting phase can lead to a reduced \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c}. However, in view of the fact that the jump in C_{\rm e}(T) at the superconducting transition is very sharp, the entire sample seems to be superconducting without any residual \gamma, which in turn suggests that the reduction in \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c} is intrinsic. In a single-band model, such a reduction can be caused by the presence of an anisotropic superconducting energy gap (order parameter) in momentum space [38]. That the reduction in \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c} is intrinsic will be clear from our analysis of the superconducting-state data using the single-band \alpha model of BCS superconductivity [38, 39, 40] below, which is applicable to the system with \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c}\neq 1.43.

In the so-called \alpha model of BCS superconductivity in order to fit the superconducting-state thermodynamic data, \alpha_{\rm BCS}\equiv\Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=1.764 is replaced by a variable \alpha[38, 39]. \alpha is determined from the jump \Delta C_{\rm e} at T_{\rm c} according to the relation [38]

\[\frac{\Delta C_{\rm e}(T_{\rm c})}{\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c}}=1.426\biggl{(} \frac{\alpha}{\alpha_{\rm BCS}}\biggr{)}^{2},\] (5)

which for \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c}=1.09(3) gives \alpha=1.54(2). This value of \alpha is significantly smaller than the BCS value of 1.764. The temperature dependence of \alpha-model superconducting-state heat capacity C_{\rm e}(T) calculated for \alpha=1.54 is shown by the solid red curve in Fig. 4(c) together with that of the BCS prediction for \alpha=\alpha_{\rm BCS}. A reasonable agreement is observed

Inset: C_{\rm p}/T vs T for 0.35 K \leqslant T\leqslant 1.2 K. The dotted red line marks the superconducting transition temperature T_{\rm c}. (b) C_{\rm p}(T) for 0.35 K \leqslant T\leqslant 0.9 K measured in different applied magnetic fields. (c) Electronic contribution C_{\rm e} to zero-field heat capacity as a function of temperature T. The solid red curve is the theoretical prediction of the \alpha model for \alpha=\Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=1.54. The BCS prediction for \alpha_{\rm BCS}=1.764 is also shown for comparison.

  between the \alpha-model prediction and the superconducting-state C_{\rm e}(T) data, which supports the applicability of the \alpha model and in turn indicates that the s-wave order parameter of LaIrSi_{3} is anisotropic in momentum space. The details about the fitting of C_{\rm e}(T) data by the \alpha model of BCS superconductivity can be found in Refs. [38; 52]. The lack of perfect agreement between the \alpha-model prediction and the experimental data may indicate that the anisotropy of the gap is not well accounted for, as the simplified \alpha model does not account for the energy dependence of the gap function or for a complex \Delta.

The thermodynamic critical field H_{\rm c} is estimated from the zero-field C_{\rm e}(T) data by integrating the entropy difference between the superconducting and normal states [51; 53], H_{\rm c}^{2}(T)=8\pi\int_{T}^{T_{\rm c}}[S_{\rm en}(T^{\prime})-S_{\rm es}(T^ {\prime})]dT^{\prime}, where S_{\rm en} and S_{\rm es} are the electronic entropy of normal and superconducting states, respectively, with S_{\rm e}(T^{\prime})=\int_{0}^{T}[C_{\rm e}(T^{\prime\prime})/T^{\prime\prime})] dT^{\prime\prime}. H_{\rm c}(T) obtained this way from the zero-field C_{\rm e}(T) is shown in Fig. 5. The T dependence of H_{\rm c} can be approximated to the conventional relation H_{\rm c}(T)=H_{\rm c}(0)[1-(T/T_{\rm c})^{2}], which gives H_{\rm c}(0)=6.10(3) mT. The solid red curve in Fig. 5 represents the fit of H_{\rm c}(T) data with this expression.

The experimental H_{\rm c}(0) so obtained is somewhat higher than the theoretical H_{\rm c}(0), which for the \alpha model is given by [38]

\[\frac{H_{\rm c}(0)}{\left(\gamma_{\rm av}T_{\rm c}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}=\sqrt{ \frac{6}{\pi}}\;\alpha\approx 1.382\,\alpha,\] (6)

where the Sommerfeld coefficient per unit volume \gamma_{\rm av} is in units of erg/cm^{3} K^{2}. From this relation for \alpha=1.54 we obtain H_{\rm c}(0)=4.5 mT, which is a little lower than H_{\rm c}(0)=6.10(3) mT obtained above. Even for \alpha_{\rm BCS}=1.764, Eq. (6) gives a lower H_{\rm c}(0)=5.1 mT. The reason for this discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical values of H_{\rm c}(0) is not clear. We suspect that this might be the result of a nonspherical/anisotropic Fermi surface in LaIrSi_{3} which is not properly accounted by equation (6).

Further, as can be seen from Fig. 5, H_{\rm c}(T) obtained from the zero-field C_{\rm e}(T) data and the H-T phase diagram determined from the H-dependent T_{\rm c} from C_{\rm p}(T,H) data in Fig. 4(b) both give very low critical fields. For a type-II superconductivity T_{\rm c}(H) obtained from C_{\rm p}(T,H) gives the upper critical field H_{\rm c2}, which is usually much higher than the thermodynamic critical field, which is not the present case. The fact that H_{\rm c2}(T) is close to H_{\rm c}(T) may suggest a type-I superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3} or a type-I.5 behavior that may arise from the presence of split spin-up and spin-down energy bands similar to what has been observed in two-band superconductor MgB_{2}[54].

The H-dependent T_{\rm c} from \rho(T,H) data in Fig. 3(b) is shown in the inset of Fig. 5, which shows a very different behavior than T_{\rm c}(H) from C_{\rm p}(T,H) data. This is consistent with the observation of different T_{\rm c} in resistivity and heat-capacity measurements in zero field mentioned above, apparently due to the filamentary/surface superconductivity that sets in at a temperature higher than the bulk superconductivity. Our estimate of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa below gives \kappa=0.55, which suggests a type-I behavior. Usually, for a type-I superconductor we do not expect a filamentary or surface superconductivity. However, surface superconductivity is predicted for a type-I superconductor with \kappa values between 1/\surd 2 and 1/2.39[55; 56]. Indeed, our estimated \kappa lies between these limits, and we can expect a surface superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3}. The critical field associated with the surface superconductivity is given by [55; 56]H_{\rm c3}=2.39\,\kappa\,H_{\rm c}; accordingly, for LaIrSi_{3} we estimate H_{\rm c3}=8.0 mT, which is much smaller than the observed upper critical field from the resistivity measurement (inset of Fig. 5). Thus the observed T_{\rm c}(H) from \rho(T,H) could not be understood to arise from surface superconductivity. The reason for such a high critical field in the resistivity measurement of LaIrSi_{3} is not clear. The type-I superconductor LaPdSi_{3} was also found to exhibit a higher critical field in the resistivity measurement compared to that in the heat capacity [31]. In a recent study Kimura _et al._[57] found a similar high critical field from the resistivity measurement on the type-I superconductor LaRhSi_{3}, and they argue that this behavior may be a common feature in noncentrosymmetric superconductors. However, we are not aware of any theoretical discussion of this aspect of noncentrosymmetric superconductors, and this hypothesis needs to be tested theoretically.

Our estimate of the superconducting London penetration depth in the clean limit at T=0, \lambda_{\rm L}(0) from v_{\rm F} using the relation [51]

\[\lambda_{\rm L}(0)^{2}=\frac{m^{*}c^{2}}{4\pi n\varepsilon^{2}}=\frac{3\pi c^{ 2}h^{3}}{4m^{*2}\varepsilon^{2}v_{\rm F}^{3}},\] (7)

where c is the speed of light in vacuum, gives \lambda_{\rm L}(0)=25.9 nm for v_{\rm F}=9.49\times 10^{7} cm/s. The BCS coherence length \xi_{0} can be obtained from v_{\rm F} and the energy gap \Delta(0), which for the \alpha model is given by [38]

\[\xi_{0}=\frac{\hbar v_{\rm F}}{\pi\,\Delta(0)}=\left(\frac{1}{\pi\alpha}\right) \frac{\hbar v_{\rm F}}{k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}}.\] (8)

Figure 5: (Color online) Thermodynamic critical field H_{\rm c} of LaIrSi_{3} as a function of temperature T obtained from the experimental electronic heat capacity C_{\rm e}(T) data. The H-dependent T_{\rm c} obtained from the heat capacity C_{\rm p}(T,H) data in Fig. 4(b) are also shown by open squares. The solid line represents the parabolic fit to H_{\rm c}(T)=H_{\rm c}(0)[1-(T/T_{\rm c})^{2}], as discussed in the text. Inset: H-T phase diagram obtained from the electrical resistivity \rho(T,H) in Fig. 3(b) together with T_{\rm c}(H) from C_{\rm p}(T,H).

  This gives \xi_{0}=2081 nm for \alpha=1.54 and v_{\rm F}=9.49\times 10^{7}cm/s. We see that \xi_{0} is much larger than the above-estimated mean free path \ell=33.7 nm, \ell/\xi_{0}\approx 0.016\ll 1, suggesting that the superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3} is in the dirty limit. In the dirty limit, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa_{\rm GL}=0.715\,\lambda_{\rm L}(0)/\ell[51], which gives \kappa_{\rm GL}=0.55<1/\surd 2, as expected for a type-I superconductivity. This value of \kappa_{\rm GL} is close to the value obtained using the dirty-limit relation for a fully gapped (isotropic) superconductor [58], \kappa_{\rm GL}=7.49\times 10^{3}\,\rho_{0}/\gamma_{\rm av}, with \rho_{0} in \Omega cm, which gives \kappa_{\rm GL}=0.59. Both estimates of \kappa_{\rm GL} consistently indicate a type-I superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3}.

The effective magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{\rm eff} can be estimated using the relation [51]

\[\lambda_{\rm eff}(0)=\lambda_{\rm L}(0)\sqrt{1+\frac{\xi_{0}}{\ell}}\qquad( \rm dirty\ limit),\] (9)

which gives \lambda_{\rm eff}(0)=205 nm. Then, using the relation \kappa_{\rm GL}=\lambda_{\rm eff}(0)/\xi(0), we estimate the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length \xi(0), which for \kappa_{\rm GL}=0.55 yields \xi(0)=373 nm. The measured and derived superconducting parameters of LaIrSi_{3} are listed in Table 2.

## VII Muon spin relaxation and rotation

The time evolution of muon spin relaxation in zero field (ZF) is shown in Fig. 6 for T both above and below the bulk T_{\rm c}. It is evident from the ZF \muSR spectra that there is no noticeable change in the relaxation rates at 1.0 K (>T_{\rm c}) and 0.05 K (<T_{\rm c}). This indicates that the time-reversal symmetry remains preserved upon entering the superconducting state. The ZF \muSR spectra are best described by the Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe function,

\[G_{z}(t)=A_{0}\big{[}\tfrac{1}{3}+\tfrac{2}{3}(1-\sigma^{2}t^{2})e^{-\sigma^{2 }t^{2}/2}\big{]}e^{-\lambda t}+A_{\rm BG},\] (10)

where A_{0} is the initial asymmetry, \sigma and \lambda are the depolarization rates, and A_{\rm BG} is the time-independent background contribution. \sigma accounts for the Gaussian distribution of static fields from nuclear moments (the local field distribution width \langle H_{\mu}\rangle=\sigma/\gamma_{\mu}, with muon gyromagnetic ratio \gamma_{\mu}=135.53 MHz/T), and \lambda accounts for the electronic moments. The fits of \muSR spectra in Fig. 6 by the decay function in Eq. (10) give \sigma=0.074(1)\mus^{-1} and \lambda=0.009(3)\mus^{-1} at 1.0 K and \sigma=0.074(1)\mus^{-1} and \lambda=0.011(2)\mus^{-1} at 0.05 K. The fits are shown by the solid red curve in Fig. 6. Since within the error bars both \sigma and \lambda at T<T_{\rm c} and T>T_{\rm c} are similar, there is no evidence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in LaIrSi_{3}.

The time evolution of muon spin rotation in transverse field (TF) is shown in Fig. 7. The TF muon spin precession signals were collected on a field-cooled sample at different applied fields both above (1.0 K) and below (0.05 K) T_{\rm c}. The TF \muSR spectra are best described by an oscillatory function damped with a Gaussian and an oscillatory background, i.e., by

\[G_{z}(t)=A_{0}\cos(\omega t+\varphi)e^{-\sigma^{2}t^{2}/2}+A_{\rm BG}\cos( \omega t+\varphi),\] (11)

where \omega=\gamma_{\mu}H_{\rm int} is the precession frequency (H_{\rm int} is the internal field at the muon site). Solid curves in Fig. 7 are the fits of the TF \muSR spectra by the decay function in Eq. (11). In the superconducting state at T=0.05 K the depolarization rate is found to increase significantly; for example, for the TF \muSR spectra at 2.5 mT, \sigma increases from its value \sigma=0.010(2)\mus^{-1} at 1.0 K to \sigma=1.45(4)\mus^{-1} at 0.05 K. Such an increase of the depolarization rate reveals bulk superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3}.

The maximum entropy spectra for TF \muSR precession at 1.0 and 0.05 K are shown in Fig. 8. The maximum entropy spectra depict the magnetic field probability distribution P(H). It is clear from Fig. 8 that at 1.0 K (in the normal state) sharp peaks are observed at H_{\rm int} exactly equal to the applied H, whereas at 0.05 K (in the superconducting state) one can see additional peaks. At H=4.0 mT, P(H) at 0.05 K shows an additional peak at H_{\rm int}>H (inset of Fig. 8). The appearance of an additional peak (near 5.5 mT, which gives an estimation of H_{\rm c}) at an internal field greater than the applied H is a characteristic

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l r} \hline Parameter & Value \\ \hline T_{\rm c} (K) & 0.72(1) \\ \gamma_{\rm a} (mJ/mol K^{2}) & 4.60(2) \\ \Theta_{\rm D} (K) & 385(8) \\ \lambda_{\rm a-ph} & 0.41 \\ \Delta C_{\rm e} (mJ/mol K) & 3.6(1) \\ \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm av}T_{\rm c} & 1.09(3) \\ \omega=\Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c} (from \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm b}T_{\rm c}) & 1.54(2) \\ \Delta(0)/k_{\rm B} (K) & 1.11 \\ H_{\rm c}(T=0) (mT) & 6.10(3) \\ \kappa_{\rm GL} & 0.55 \\ \xi(0) (mm) & 373 \\ \xi_{0} (mm) & 2081 \\ \ell (mm) & 33.7 \\ \lambda_{\rm L}(0)  of a type-I behavior and indicates a type-I superconductivity in LalrSi_{3} consistent with the above inference from the value of \kappa_{\rm GL} in Table 2. Further at 0.05 K for H\leqslant 4.0 mT we also observe an increase in P(H) near H_{\rm int}\sim 0.5 mT, as is expected for a sample in the Meissner state.

However, no such increase in P(H) is observed from the Meissner volume in the intermediate state (i.e., at H=5.0 mT). At H=6.0 mT no additional peak is observed in P(H) at H_{\rm int}>H even on an expanded scale. This could be understood to be due to the fact that the applied H is close to H_{c}=6.1 mT (see Table 2) and the sample is on the verge of a transition from a superconducting to a normal state at H=6.0 mT. Thus the \muSR data also reflect a low thermodynamic critical field H_{c}\approx 5.5 mT, in line with the estimate of H_{c} from the heat-capacity data.

## VIII Conclusions

The superconducting and normal-state properties of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor LaIrSi_{3}, which crystallizes in a BaNiSn_{3}-type tetragonal crystal structure (space group I4 _mm_), were investigated using \mathcal{C}_{\rm p}(T,H), \rho(T,H), and \muSR measurements which demonstrate bulk BCS superconductivity below T_{c}=0.72(1) K. A nonbulk superconductivity sets in at a higher T_{c} in \rho(T). In the normal state \rho exhibits metallic behavior, and \rho(T\geqslant 1.6 K) is well described by the Bloch-Gruneisen model of resistivity. Our analysis of low-temperature normal-state C_{\rm p}(T) data yields a Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma_{\rm n}=4.60(2) mJ/mol K^{2}, corresponding to the density of states at Fermi energy \mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F})=1.95(1) states/eV f.u. for both spin directions.

The superconducting transition is revealed by a very sharp jump in C_{\rm p} at T_{\rm c}=0.72(1) K, however, with a value of \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c}=1.09(3) lower than the BCS expected value of 1.43. The reduced value of \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c} seems to indicate an anisotropic energy gap in LaIrSi_{3}. The superconducting-state electronic heat-capacity data are analyzed by the single-band \alpha model of BCS superconductivity that describes the experimental data reasonably. \alpha=\Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=1.54(2) obtained from the jump in C_{\rm p} is smaller than \alpha_{\rm BCS}=1.764, indicating the s-wave order parameter of LaIrSi_{3} is anisotropic in momentum space. Even though the single-band \alpha model describes the superconducting-state data reasonably, considering the split spin-up and spin-down bands in LaIrSi_{3}, the possibility of two-band superconductivity cannot be ruled out. The presence of two bands is also known to result in a reduced \Delta C_{\rm e}/\gamma_{\rm n}T_{\rm c}[38; 59]. Since the two-band effect and an anisotropy modification to a single band have similar manifestations, it is very difficult to distinguish between them by examining the thermodynamic quantities. Recently, a two-band superconductivity with equal energy gaps was reported in SrPt_{3}P [60]. Further investigations are desired to check for the possibility of a similar two-band single-gap superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3}.

Various normal- and superconducting-state parameters have been estimated which indicate a dirty-limit weak-coupling type-I s-wave BCS superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3}. Type-I superconductivity is further confirmed by \muSR. The \muSR measurement also revealed that the time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the superconducting state, thus confirming a conventional s-wave singlet pairing superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3}. Thus, despite a large splitting of Fermi surfaces due to antisymmetric coupling on account of the noncentrosymmetric structure inferred from the de Haas-van Alphen effect study [33], no clear signature of parity mixing or a

  spin-triplet pairing state is found in our investigations of the superconducting-state properties of LaIrSi_{3}.

The type-I superconductivity in LaIrSi_{3} is similar to that of NCS LaRhSi_{3}, which also exhibits conventional s-wave electron-phonon-mediated type-I superconductivity with preserved time-reversal symmetry and a singlet pairing [26]. LaRhSi_{3} and LaIrSi_{3} have similar \mathcal{D}(E_{\rm F}) and \Theta_{\rm D}; therefore one would expect the T_{\rm c} of these two compounds to be similar; however, we see that T_{\rm c}=0.72(1) K for LaIrSi_{3} is significantly lower than T_{\rm c}=2.16(8) K for LaRhSi_{3}[26]. While the reason for this contrasting behavior is not clear, T_{\rm c} appears to have a relation with the outer-shell electronic configuration of Rh (4d) and Ir (5d) in these two superconductors. A similar trend has been observed in other 4d and 5d systems, such as in LaPdSi_{3} [T_{\rm c}=2.65(5) K] and LaPtSi_{3} [T_{\rm c}=1.52(6) K] [31] as well as in Li_{2}Pd_{3}B [T_{\rm c}=6.7 K] and Li_{2}Pt_{3}B [T_{\rm c}=2.43 K] [11]. The 4d-based superconductors appear to have higher T_{\rm c} than those with 5d. Further investigations to understand this aspect of superconductivity in these compounds are desired.

The effect of the lack of inversion symmetry on the superconducting properties of LaIrSi_{3} does not seem to be pronounced despite a large splitting of spin-up and spin-down energy bands due to ASOC. Similar behavior is reported for NCS BaPtSi_{3}[21], for which electronic-structure calculations revealed the splitting of bands because of spin-orbit interactions; however, the superconductivity turned out to be conventional BCS-like with a singlet paring. Such observations raise an important question: what else besides ASOC controls the appearance of anomalous superconducting state in a noncentrosymmetric system? The anomalous superconducting properties of the Ce-based strongly correlated NCSs, such as CePt_{3}Si [9], CeRhSi_{3}[13], and CeIrSi_{3}[14] can naively be related to the magnetic pairing due to the presence of 4f moments. However, the unusual superconducting properties of weakly correlated NCSs Li_{2}Pt_{3}B [11], LaNiC_{2}[19, 20], and Re_{6}Zr [30] are not then obvious as they do not show any evidence of magnetic order. An important difference between the two groups of nonmagnetic NCSs, i.e., those exhibiting unusual superconducting properties and those exhibiting conventional superconductivity, is the difference in their crystal structures/space groups. This may suggest that these two groups of nonmagnetic NCSs may have different Fermi surface topologies that may have some role in realizing the effect of ASOC. A comparative study of the extent of ASOC in nonmagnetic NCSs, preferably by a technique that can directly probe Fermi surface topology, such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, complemented with band-structure calculations can shed light on this issue and would be of help in understanding the relationship between ASOC, Fermi surface topology, and anomalous superconductivity in NCSs.
