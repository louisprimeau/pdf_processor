###### Abstract

The magnetic phase diagram of Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4+\delta} has been investigated up to oxygen content \delta= 0.064. Magnetization, susceptibility, and muon spin relaxation experimental data show that an unconventional spin-glass (SG) phase sets in for \delta\simeq0.06. A well defined SG-like transition occurs at T_{g}=5 K for the compound with maximum oxygen content. Below T_{g}, however, the shape of susceptibility curves as well as the \mu^{+}-polarization recovery laws point out the persistence of residual spin-fluctuations, a signature of a noncomplete freezing of the magnetic lattice. These experimental evidences can be explained by assuming two different slowing down processes for the fluctuations of the Cu and Nd spin ensembles. A phase diagram which agrees with the main results on other high-T_{c} cuprates is reported.

It exhibits superconductivity for 0.14\leq.x\leq0.18 and has a maximum transition temperature T_{c}\approx 25 K for x= 0.15. The prime charge carriers are electrons and for this reason NCCO is clearly distinguished from the hole-doped HTSC's. As in all HTSC cuprates, physical properties are obviously strongly affected by charge carrier density \rho. [2] The study of the magnetic properties on varying \rho leads to the determination of a rich phase diagram which is qualitatively similar for all the cuprate HTSC's. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] Starting from the parent antiferromagnetic (AF) compound Nd_{2}CuO_{4} (La_{2}CuO_{4} for La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}), the magnetic ordering Neel temperature of NCCO diminishes with increasing doping, until x\simeq 0.14 where the AF phase disappears and superconductivity sets in. [10] The presence of an intermediate spin-glass (SG) phase, typical of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} systems, [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] in NCCO has been questioned. [10] In fact, due to substantial difficulties in controlling the doping-carriers content, the details of the HTSC magnetic phase diagram are strongly debated. In NCCO the charge carrier density can be controlled not only by Ce doping but also by varying the oxygen content at fixed Ce stoichiometry. In this paper we will focus on the system Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4+\delta}. [11, 12] By changing the oxygen amount at fixed Ce content, the transport and magnetic properties of this compound are drastically modified. [11] Defining n the number of electrons per Cu atom (n = 0.15- 2 \delta), the system passes from nonsuperconducting to superconducting behavior at n = n_{0}\simeq 0.07. No detailed study of the magnetic properties as a function of the oxygen content until the maximum possible amount has been reported and we aim at filling this lack. The resulting magnetic phase diagram is qualitatively similar to all other high-T_{c} cuprates. [3, 5, 6]

Powder samples of Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4+\delta} were prepared as described in Ref. [11], with excess oxygen content \delta\simeq 0.06, 0.062, 0.064. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements were performed by a MPMS-XL7 Quantum Design magnetometer, in the temperature range 1.8-300 K at different constant magnetic fields. Hysteresis and relaxation of the magnetization data were collected at T= 2 K on the sample with \delta= 0.064. The muon spin relaxation (\mu^{+}SR) data were collected at the ISIS facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (U.K.), in the temperature range 0.06 - 300 K in zero and different longitudinal magnetic fields.

For oxygen content \delta< 0.045, [11, 12] the magnetic susceptibility \chi(T) data follow the typical behavior of superconducting samples. [12] For 0.045<\delta< 0.06, [11, 12] the compounds are standard paramagnets mainly due to the contribution of Nd(III) ions to the total magnetization. Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4+\delta} displays a low-temperature SG-like behavior for \delta> 0.06. The first evidence comes from the behavior of the zero-field cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) susceptibility data, reported in Fig. 1 for the sample with \delta = 0.064 in H = 40 G. As is well known, [13] the maximum in the ZFC data, occurring at T\simeq 4.5 K, corresponds to the "spin freezing" temperature T_{g} and displaces toward lower temperatures by increasing applied magnetic field (data not reported).

The magnetization hysteresis curve at T= 2 K displayed in the inset of Fig. 2, confirms that the system undergoes a spin-glass transition rather than a transition to a magnetically ordered state, as no hysteretic opening either in FC and ZFC

Figure 1: Magnetic susceptibility \chi= M/H vs temperature for the Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4.064} sample in a magnetic field H = 40 G. Both zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) curves are shown. For T> 30 K the experimental data are reproduced by the characteristic paramagnetic behavior \chi = C/(T+\theta).

  conditions is observed. Relaxation data, however (Fig. 2), collected at T= 2 K by following the time evolution of the magnetization M(t) after zero-field cooling of the samples and subsequent application of a magnetic field H= 7 T for about 5 min, point out the atypical character of the SG phase. Two different relaxation time-scales are observed in the M(t) relaxation, so that the attempts to fit the data with "single-exponential-like" functions of the form M(t) = M_{0}exp(-\,\alpha t^{1-d}), typical of conventional SG's [13], fail. We suggest that at such low temperatures, either Cu and Nd ion spins tend to freeze, giving rise to a complex SG phase. In fact, one obtains a good fit for M(t) by using a superposition of two SG-like relaxation functions, in the form

\[M(t) = M_{0}^{\rm Nd}\exp(-\,\alpha_{\rm Nd}t^{1-d}) + M_{0}^{\rm Cu}\exp(-\,\alpha_{\rm Cu}t^{1-d}),\] (1)

with d= 0.648, close to the value d= 0.66 expected in the single-exponential evolution of magnetization in conventional SG formed by a unique type of spins.

To support our hypothesis, we remind what happens in pure and slightly Ce-doped Nd_{2}CuO_{4}, which are less disordered systems than the ones considered here. By lowering T, three different phase transitions to magnetically ordered lattices with different spins rearrangement occur (see, e.g., Ref. [14]). At T\simeq 255 K, the first phase transition occurs and the Cu spins show a three-dimensional (3D) AF order with a La_{2}NiO_{4}-type structure. At T\simeq 80 K a second phase transition occurs, and the Cu spins rearrange in a La_{2}CuO_{4}-type structure. At T\simeq 30 K a third transition is caused by the rearrangement of Cu spins magnetic structure (in La_{2}NiO_{4} type again) and, on a second sublattice, by the Nd ions AF order [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70,  where f_{\rm KT}=[\,1/3\,+\,2/3(1-\gamma_{\mu}^{2}\Delta^{2}\,t^{2})\exp(-1/2\gamma_{\mu}^{2}\Delta^{2}\,t^{2})\,] (\gamma_{\mu} = muon gyromagnetic ratio, \Delta = second moment of the distribution of local fields at the muon site). In Eq. (2), the relaxation rate \lambda_{F} is associated to muons relaxing faster and \lambda_{S} to muons relaxing slower.

(II) T<4.5 K. For T<4.5 K the exponential component with fast relaxation rate \lambda_{F} gives way to a loss of muon asymmetry. The data can be fitted by

\[P(t)=a_{S}\exp(-\,\lambda_{S}t)+f_{\rm KT}.\] (3)

From the above analysis we can conclude that the muons implant in three different sites: (a) site A, muons near the Cu spins, where the muon polarization relaxes fast for T>4.5 K; (b) site B, muons farther from Cu spins, where the muon polarization relaxes slowly; and (c) site C, near the Nd spins, where f_{\rm KT} reflects the progressive localization of Nd spins.

The total apparent initial muon asymmetry [Fig. 4(c)] starts to diminish by decreasing T from 100 K and displays a further clear step at T\sim4.5 K. We suggest that the loss of muon asymmetry in the range 4.5<T<100 K is due to muons whose polarization precesses around the local field at the muon site C, created by progressively localizing Nd spins. The low T (<4.5 K) loss of asymmetry is associated to the component pertaining to muons in site A, and sets in when the Cu spins slow down to give a SG phase.

We now discuss the spin dynamics as a function of temperature in terms of the evolution of the different fit parameters in Eqs. (2) and (3). The temperature behavior of \lambda_{F}(T) shows a divergence by approaching T\sim4.5 K from above, typical of phase transitions [5] [see Fig. 4(b)]. As said above, below 4.5 K this fast relaxing component disappears [see also total asymmetry in Fig. 4(c)] because a local field H_{\rm loc} at the muon site is present and the precession of the muon polarization around this field occurs at too high frequencies to be detected at the RAL facility (H_{\rm loc}>700 Oe). Such behavior of \lambda_{F}(T) reflects the slowing down of the Cu spin fluctuations when the Cu spins' sublattice approaches the SG transition temperature T\sim4.5 K. Below 4.5 K, a short-range order of Cu spins is reached, and the related SG-like phase is thought to be similar to the one detected in LASCO and YBCO high-T_{c} systems for low holes-doping. [5, 6, 7, 26] It should be remarked that in LASCO and YBCO systems the SG-like phase was evidenced by \muSR too. [7, 26]

This picture is confirmed by the behavior of \lambda_{S}(T) that displays a peak for T\sim4.5 K [Fig. 4(a)]. This means that muons farther from Cu spins are also sensitive to the slowing-down of the (Cu) spin fluctuations (see, e.g., Ref. [5] for a more extensive treatment of the effect of this slowing-down on a spin-lattice T_{1}-like relaxation process).

Let us finally concentrate on the KT-like component. In Fig. 5, the behavior of the second moment of the distribution

Figure 4: Temperature behavior ZF-\muSR spin-lattice relaxation rates of Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO4.064 for muons in site A [\lambda_{F} (a)] and in site B [\lambda_{S} (b)]; see also text. The solid line marks the transition to the SG-like phase of Cu sublattice. (c) Background subtracted total initial apparent ZF muon asymmetry as a function of temperature. The loss of asymmetry is due to the presence of local fields at the muon sites.

Figure 5: Temperature behavior of the second moment \Delta_{\rm KT} of the KT-like component of the total muon asymmetry of Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO4.064. The low-T flattening corresponds to Nd-spin freezing.

Figure 6: Magnetic phase diagram of Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO4.+\delta, obtained combining the data of the present work and those of Refs. [11] and [12]. For \delta\leq0.045 the sample is superconducting while for \delta\geq0.06 a low temperature “exotic” SG-like phase exists with Cu (SGI) and Nd (SGII) spin freezing. For intermediate doping, the magnetic phase character is not yet established.

  of local fields \Delta(T) at the muon site C (i.e., near the Nd ions) is reported. As can be seen, starting from T\sim 100 K, \Delta(T) tends to increase: at T\sim 100 K its value is \sim 1 \mus^{-1}, while it reaches a plateau \Delta(T)\sim 9 \mus^{-1} for T<2 K, corresponding to a local fields distribution of width \deltaH_{\rm loc}\sim 600 Oe. This temperature (T\sim 2 K) can be identified as the temperature of extreme slowing down of the Nd spins.

As a final result, the magnetic phase diagram of the compound Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4^{+}\delta s}, deduced after our magnetic susceptibility and \muSR experiments, is reported in Fig. 6. While for \delta\approx 0.045 the system is superconducting, for \delta\approx 0.06 an exotic SG phase sets in. In this phase the Cu and Nd spins tend to order in two spatially disordered magnetic lattices. In Fig. 6 the freezing temperature T_{g} of the Cu magnetic moments is reported (SGI phase), while the characteristic SG transition temperature for the Nd spins (SGII phase) cannot actually be precisely estimated, due to the progressive character of the Nd spin fluctuations slowing down.[25] A very recent paper proved the existence of a strict similarity in the electronic structure between electron (NCCO) and hole (LASCO) doped cuprates.[27] The present paper supports the conclusion that this similarity reflects directly in the magnetic phase diagram.

###### Abstract

The magnetic phase diagram of Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4+\delta} has been investigated up to oxygen content \delta= 0.064. Magnetization, susceptibility, and muon spin relaxation experimental data show that an unconventional spin-glass (SG) phase sets in for \delta\simeq0.06. A well defined SG-like transition occurs at T_{g}=5 K for the compound with maximum oxygen content. Below T_{g}, however, the shape of susceptibility curves as well as the \mu^{+}-polarization recovery laws point out the persistence of residual spin-fluctuations, a signature of a noncomplete freezing of the magnetic lattice. These experimental evidences can be explained by assuming two different slowing down processes for the fluctuations of the Cu and Nd spin ensembles. A phase diagram which agrees with the main results on other high-T_{c} cuprates is reported.

[10] In fact, due to substantial difficulties in controlling the doping-carriers content, the details of the HTSC magnetic phase diagram are strongly debated. In NCCO the charge carrier density can be controlled not only by Ce doping but also by varying the oxygen content at fixed Ce stoichiometry. In this paper we will focus on the system Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4+\delta}. [11, 12] By changing the oxygen amount at fixed Ce content, the transport and magnetic properties of this compound are drastically modified.

Relaxation data, however (Fig. 2), collected at T= 2 K by following the time evolution of the magnetization M(t) after zero-field cooling of the samples and subsequent application of a magnetic field H= 7 T for about 5 min, point out the atypical character of the SG phase.

At T\simeq 30 K a third transition is caused by the rearrangement of Cu spins magnetic structure (in La_{2}NiO_{4} type again) and, on a second sublattice, by the Nd ions AF order [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70,  where f_{\rm KT}=[\,1/3\,+\,2/3(1-\gamma_{\mu}^{2}\Delta^{2}\,t^{2})\exp(-1/2\gamma_{\mu}^{2}\Delta^{2}\,t^{2})\,] (\gamma_{\mu} = muon gyromagnetic ratio, \Delta = second moment of the distribution of local fields at the muon site). In Eq. (2), the relaxation rate \lambda_{F} is associated to muons relaxing faster and \lambda_{S} to muons relaxing slower.

(II) T<4.5 K. For T<4.5 K the exponential component with fast relaxation rate \lambda_{F} gives way to a loss of muon asymmetry. The data can be fitted by

\[P(t)=a_{S}\exp(-\,\lambda_{S}t)+f_{\rm KT}.\] (3)

From the above analysis we can conclude that the muons implant in three different sites: (a) site A, muons near the Cu spins, where the muon polarization relaxes fast for T>4.5 K; (b) site B, muons farther from Cu spins, where the muon polarization relaxes slowly; and (c) site C, near the Nd spins, where f_{\rm KT} reflects the progressive localization of Nd spins.

The total apparent initial muon asymmetry [Fig. 4(c)] starts to diminish by decreasing T from 100 K and displays a further clear step at T\sim4.5 K. We suggest that the loss of muon asymmetry in the range 4.5<T<100 K is due to muons whose polarization precesses around the local field at the muon site C, created by progressively localizing Nd spins. The low T (<4.5 K) loss of asymmetry is associated to the component pertaining to muons in site A, and sets in when the Cu spins slow down to give a SG phase.

We now discuss the spin dynamics as a function of temperature in terms of the evolution of the different fit parameters in Eqs. (2) and (3). The temperature behavior of \lambda_{F}(T) shows a divergence by approaching T\sim4.5 K from above, typical of phase transitions [5] [see Fig. 4(b)]. As said above, below 4.5 K this fast relaxing component disappears [see also total asymmetry in Fig. 4(c)] because a local field H_{\rm loc} at the muon site is present and the precession of the muon polarization around this field occurs at too high frequencies to be detected at the RAL facility (H_{\rm loc}>700 Oe). Such behavior of \lambda_{F}(T) reflects the slowing down of the Cu spin fluctuations when the Cu spins' sublattice approaches the SG transition temperature T\sim4.5 K. Below 4.5 K, a short-range order of Cu spins is reached, and the related SG-like phase is thought to be similar to the one detected in LASCO and YBCO high-T_{c} systems for low holes-doping. [5, 6, 7, 26] It should be remarked that in LASCO and YBCO systems the SG-like phase was evidenced by \muSR too. [7, 26]

This picture is confirmed by the behavior of \lambda_{S}(T) that displays a peak for T\sim4.5 K [Fig. 4(a)]. This means that muons farther from Cu spins are also sensitive to the slowing-down of the (Cu) spin fluctuations (see, e.g., Ref. [5] for a more extensive treatment of the effect of this slowing-down on a spin-lattice T_{1}-like relaxation process).

Let us finally concentrate on the KT-like component. In Fig. 5, the behavior of the second moment of the distribution

The solid line marks the transition to the SG-like phase of Cu sublattice. (c) Background subtracted total initial apparent ZF muon asymmetry as a function of temperature. The loss of asymmetry is due to the presence of local fields at the muon sites.

Figure 6: Magnetic phase diagram of Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO4.+\delta, obtained combining the data of the present work and those of Refs. [11] and [12]. For \delta\leq0.045 the sample is superconducting while for \delta\geq0.06 a low temperature “exotic” SG-like phase exists with Cu (SGI) and Nd (SGII) spin freezing. For intermediate doping, the magnetic phase character is not yet established.

  of local fields \Delta(T) at the muon site C (i.e., near the Nd ions) is reported. As can be seen, starting from T\sim 100 K, \Delta(T) tends to increase: at T\sim 100 K its value is \sim 1 \mus^{-1}, while it reaches a plateau \Delta(T)\sim 9 \mus^{-1} for T<2 K, corresponding to a local fields distribution of width \deltaH_{\rm loc}\sim 600 Oe. This temperature (T\sim 2 K) can be identified as the temperature of extreme slowing down of the Nd spins.

As a final result, the magnetic phase diagram of the compound Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4^{+}\delta s}, deduced after our magnetic susceptibility and \muSR experiments, is reported in Fig. 6. While for \delta\approx 0.045 the system is superconducting, for \delta\approx 0.06 an exotic SG phase sets in. In this phase the Cu and Nd spins tend to order in two spatially disordered magnetic lattices. In Fig. 6 the freezing temperature T_{g} of the Cu magnetic moments is reported (SGI phase), while the characteristic SG transition temperature for the Nd spins (SGII phase) cannot actually be precisely estimated, due to the progressive character of the Nd spin fluctuations slowing down.[25] A very recent paper proved the existence of a strict similarity in the electronic structure between electron (NCCO) and hole (LASCO) doped cuprates.[27] The present paper supports the conclusion that this similarity reflects directly in the magnetic phase diagram.
