###### Abstract

The recently discovered BaPt_{2}As_{2} shows a structural distortion at around 275 K, followed by the emergence of superconductivity at lower temperatures. Here we identify the presence of charge-density-wave order at room temperature and ambient pressure using single-crystal x-ray diffraction, with both a superlattice and an incommensurate modulation, where there is a change of the superlattice structure below \simeq275 K. Upon applying pressure, BaPt_{2}As_{2} shows a rich temperature-pressure phase diagram with multiple pressure-induced transitions at high temperatures, the emergence of disappearance of which are correlated with sudden changes in the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}. These findings demonstrate that BaPt_{2}As_{2} is a promising system for studying competing interactions and the relationship between high-temperature electronic instabilities and superconductivity.

## I Introduction

The presence of competing interactions and multiple electronic instabilities often leads to emergent phenomena and new phases. In particular, the complex relationship between superconductivity and magnetic or charge order has attracted considerable interest. In many of the high-temperature iron-pnictide superconductors, the superconductivity occurs in the vicinity of spin-density-wave (SDW) order [1, 2]. Meanwhile, upon applying pressure to the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCu_{2}Si_{2}[3], evidence was found of superconductivity being in close proximity to multiple instabilities, with one superconducting dome in the vicinity of magnetic order and another near a possible valence instability [4, 5, 6]. The interplay between charge-density-wave (CDW) order and superconductivity has also been of particular interest recently [7, 8], mainly due to the coexistence of these competing phases in some systems, with a similar phase diagram to systems with SDW and superconductivity [9], as well as the observation of CDW in high-temperature cuprate superconductors. In the cuprates, the role of CDW order in the formation of superconductivity remains a central and open issue [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], but the microscopic relationship is still unresolved.

Structural distortions have also been found to occur in various iron-based superconductors [16]. For instance, upon lowering the temperature of electron-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}, the symmetry of the crystal lattice is reduced from the fourfold symmetry of the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure to a twofold symmetric orthorhombic structure, while SDW ordering onsets at lower temperatures [17, 18]. There is an increasing body of evidence that this distortion does not arise due to phonons [19], but is from an electronic instability, the nematic order, which may be driven by either spin or orbital fluctuations [20]. The suppression of both nematicity and SDW ordering in the region of the superconducting dome again indicates the importance of understanding the relationship between the various ordered phases and the underlying interactions. On the other hand, there also exist some non-iron-based 122 pnictide superconductors RT_{2}Pn_{2} (R= Ba or Sr, T denotes transition metal, and Pn denotes pnictogen) that undergo structural distortions upon cooling [21, 22, 23]. A comparison with the iron-based materials may provide crucial insights into the roles of various interactions and the resulting collective phenomena.

Unlike the 122 iron-pnictide superconductors, which crystallize in the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure (I4/mmm), SrPt_{2}As_{2} forms in the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure (P4/nmm) at high temperatures. Both are layered tetragonal structures, but they have different stacking of the layers of transition metal and As atoms along the c axis. A further difference from the iron pnictides is that in the Pt-based materials, spin fluctuations are not generally expected to play a significant role. Below T_{\text{CDW}}=470 K, the crystal structure of SrPt_{2}As_{2} undergoes an orthorhombic distortion and CDW ordering [24, 25, 26, 27], with a superconducting transition at a lower temperature of 5.2 K [22]. Similarly, in the newly discovered BaPt_{2}As_{2} with a resistive transition at T_{c}=1.67 K [28], a first-order phase transition appears at about 275 K, at which a structural phase transition from the tetragonal CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure to an orthorhombic structure was found using powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) [28]. In this article, we demonstrate using single-crystal XRD measurements that a CDW state already exists at room temperature in BaPt_{2}As_{2}, and the structural transition at T_{1}\simeq 275 K corresponds to a change in the CDW superlattice. To study the relationship between superconductivity and the CDW state, we performed resistivity measurements under pressure, which reveal a rich temperature-pressure phase diagram with multiple pressure-induced transitions, the emergence of which are correlated with sudden changes in T_{c}.

 

## II Experimental Methods

Single crystals of BaPt_{2}As_{2} were synthesized using a self-flux method described in Ref. [28]. Resistivity measurements under pressure were carried out using a piston-cylinder-type pressure cell up to 27 kbar, and Daphne 7373 was used as the pressure-transmitting medium to ensure hydrostaticity. The applied pressure was determined by the shift in T_{c} of a high-quality Pb single crystal. Measurements were performed using a Physical Property Measurement System (Quantum Design PPMS-14T) in the temperature range of 2-300 K, while measurements from 0.3 to 5 K were performed using a ^{3}He refrigerator. Single-crystal XRD from room temperature to 100 K was carried out on a STOE IPDS II diffractometer at the Argonne National Laboratory, using an Mo source (\lambda = 0.710 73 A). Reciprocal space reconstruction of the single-crystal XRD data was performed with the software x-area.

## III Results

### Single-crystal x-ray diffraction

A simulation of the diffraction peaks in the (hk0) plane for the tetragonal CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure (P4/nmm) is shown in Fig. 1(a), while the reciprocal space reconstruction of single-crystal XRD data at 300 and 100 K is shown in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c), respectively. Reflections are labeled with the Miller indices of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure (P4/nmm).

In the previous powder XRD measurements [28], we reported a structural phase transition at 275 K from a tetragonal CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure to an orthorhombic one. Based on the current single-crystal XRD results, it should be noted that neither the reflections at 300 K nor those at 100 K could be satisfactorily indexed with a perfect CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type crystal structure. From comparing the experimental data at both 300 and 100 K with the simulated reflections, we observe a number of additional peaks arising from complex CDW modulations. If we index the single-crystal XRD data by introducing an orthorhombic distortion, the lattice parameters at 300 K are a = 4.5608(10) A, b = 4.5643(12) A, and c = 10.0420(20) A, while at 100 K they are a = 4.5489(9) A, b = 4.5700(11) A, and c = 10.0192(22) A. These results indicate that even at room temperature, the CDW modulations induce a small difference in a and b, which becomes larger below 280 K. Subsequent analysis of the data at 300 K reveals peaks corresponding to 2 x 2 x 2 superlattice structure, where the unit cell is doubled in all directions, along with an incommensurate modulation \mathbf{q_{1}} = (0.1,0.3,0). Reflections that are forbidden for the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure, such as (1,0,0) and (0,1,0), and the half-fractional peaks such as (-1/2, -1/2,0) arise from the 2 x 2 x superlattice structure, while the peaks at the position of (0.1,0.3,0) around the superlattice peaks arise from the incommensurate modulation. A comparison of the data from 300 to 285 K shows no change in the structure of BaPt_{2}As_{2}. From 280 to 100 K, BaPt_{2}As_{2} enters a new phase in which the symmetry further lowers to a 6 x 6 x 2 superlattice structure while the incommensurate modulation \mathbf{q_{1}} remains the same, as indicated by the appearance of new fractional peaks such as (2/3,0,0) and (0,2/3,0). Therefore, these results demonstrate that the CDW state is already present at room temperature, but there is a change in CDW structure below 280 K, along with an increased orthorhombic distortion.

### Resistivity under pressure

The temperature-pressure phase diagram of BaPt_{2}As_{2} was determined by measuring the resistivity under pressure. As shown in Fig. 2(a), at p = 3 kbar there is a sudden increase of the resistivity upon cooling at about T_{1}\simeq 250 K, which is similar to the previously reported results at ambient pressure [28], and it corresponds to a change of the CDW structure. With increasing pressure, the temperature of this transition decreases before abruptly disappearing above p_{1}\simeq 7 kbar. After T_{1} disappears, a new transition labeled T_{2} is observed, where there is only a small anomaly in the resistivity and little change with increasing pressure. For pressures greater than p_{2}\simeq 17 kbar, T_{2} disappears and two new transitions

Reciprocal space reconstruction of the single-crystal XRD data collected at (b) 300 K and (c) 100 K. At 300 K, other than the simulated peaks of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure, there are satellite peaks which can be indexed with a 2 × 2 × 2 superlattice and an incommensurate modulation with a propagation vector \mathbf{q_{i}} = (0.1,0.3,0). At 100 K, additional satellite peaks corresponding to a 6 × 6 × 2 superlattice are observed.

 emerge at T_{3} and T_{4}, with the former corresponding to an increase of the resistivity upon cooling, while the latter shows a sudden decrease. These transitions have a different pressure dependence, with the lower transition T_{3} being rapidly suppressed with increasing pressure while T_{4} increases with pressure. Note that apart from T_{2}, all the transitions display pronounced hysteresis, as shown in Figs. 2(b)-2(d), indicating a first-order nature. It can also be seen that there is an increase in resistivity at T_{1} and T_{3} while it drops at T_{4}.

Figure 3(a) displays the resistivity under pressure at low temperatures in the vicinity of the superconducting transitions. At ambient pressure, T_{c} is about 1.6 K, determined from where the resistivity reaches 50% of the normal state value \rho_{0}\simeq 174\,\mu\Omega cm, similar to that previously reported [28]. With increasing pressure, the superconducting transition sharpens and T_{c} undergoes a moderate enhancement at around 7 kbar, which is close to p_{1}, to around 2 K, along with a small decrease of \rho_{0}. Further increasing the pressure up to 13 kbar results in little change of T_{c}. However, upon applying pressures greater than 13 kbar, there is another jump in T_{c} that is larger in size, reaching a near constant value above 17 kbar. The superconducting transition at 17 kbar is significantly broader than that at both lower and higher pressures, which may be due to a pressure inhomogeneity, leading to the coexistence of both superconducting phases. The newly emerged superconducting phase has the highest T_{c}\simeq 3.8 K, the lowest residual resistivity in the normal state, and T_{c} changes little with pressure up to 26 kbar. The upper critical field H_{c2}(T) at different pressures is shown in Fig. 3(b). The values of H_{c2} were measured in three regions of the temperature-pressure phase diagram (0, 7, and 19 kbar), and they were normalized by the product of T_{c} and the derivative of H_{c2} near T_{c}. When the normalized H_{c2} is plotted as a function of T/T_{c}, all the data fall on one curve, in good agreement with the orbital limited values of H_{c2} calculated using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) model shown by the dashed line [29]. This suggests that there is no change of the superconducting pairing state under pressure, and that orbital limiting rather than Pauli limiting is the dominant pair breaking mechanism. Meanwhile, as displayed in Fig. 4, the low-temperature normal state resistivity could be well fitted with Fermi liquid behavior, \rho(T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{2}.

Figure 5(a) displays the temperature-pressure phase diagram obtained from resistivity measurements. Two abrupt enhancements of T_{c} occur under pressure, both of which clearly coincide with changes in the high-temperature phase transitions. At p_{1}\simeq 7 kbar, the CDW transition at T_{1} disappears and a new transition T_{2} is observed. This change is accompanied by an enhancement of T_{c}. Upon further increasing the applied pressure, there is little change of T_{2} up to p_{2}\simeq 17 kbar, where the transition at T_{2} is no longer observed

Figure 2: (a) Temperature dependence of the resistivity of BaPt_{2}As_{2} at various pressures. The different high-temperature transitions are denoted by T_{1}, T_{2}, T_{3}, and T_{4}. The resistivity upon warming and cooling is shown in the vicinity of (b) T_{1} at 4 kbar, (c) T_{2} at 9 kbar, and (d) T_{3} and T_{4} at 17 kbar. In (c) the derivative d\rho/dT is also shown by the solid line, which shows a clear change at T_{2}.

  and two new phase transitions emerge. The transition at T_{3} decreases with increasing pressure before being suppressed at less than 22 kbar, while T_{4} increases with pressure, reaching 290 K at 24 kbar. The appearance of these transitions is accompanied by another pronounced enhancement of T_{c} by almost a factor of 2. The critical pressure for the emergence of T_{3} and T_{4} is slightly lower than that corresponding to the jump in T_{c}. This may be due to the variation in the pressure transmitted by the Daphne 7373 medium with temperature, which can cause a pressure decrease of around 1-2 kbar between 300 K and low temperatures [30]. Furthermore, the results from fitting the resistivity in the normal state are shown in Fig. 5(b). Each steplike increase of T_{c} coincides with a drop in \rho_{0}, with a small decrease at the disappearance of T_{1} and a larger drop at the emergence of T_{3} and T_{4}. Meanwhile, the resistivity coefficient A undergoes a sharp drop at p_{1} followed by a sudden increase at p_{2}. Furthermore, neither \rho_{0} nor A displays any noticeable anomaly upon the disappearance of the transition at T_{3}.

## IV Discussion and Summary

The above results demonstrate an intricate relationship between the superconductivity and the high-temperature transitions in BaPt_{2}As_{2}. The nature of the transitions at T_{2}, T_{3}, and T_{4} is yet to be uncovered. In comparison, SrPt_{2}As_{2} undergoes a structural phase transition below T_{\rm CDW}=470 K, from a tetragonal to orthorhombic structure [25], with two incommensurate CDW modulations emerging [24, 26]. However, in BaPt_{2}As_{2} at ambient pressure the orthorhombic distortion and CDW modulation already exist above T_{1}, and this transition corresponds to a change of the periodicity of the superlattice. Furthermore, there is a sudden increase in the resistivity at T_{1} as in the case of the structural transition in SrNi_{2}P_{2}[31], whereas there is a drop in the resistivity at T_{\rm CDW} in SrPt_{2}As_{2}. However, the behavior of BaPt_{2}As_{2} above 22 kbar more strongly resembles that of SrPt_{2}As_{2}, since we observe a drop in the resistivity at T_{4} and there is a comparable value of T_{c}.

If then the transition under pressure at T_{4} is similar to that of SrPt_{2}As_{2} at ambient pressure, the differences in the CDW modulation and high-temperature crystal structures may explain the different behavior of the resistivity seen at T_{1} and T_{4}. This suggests the possibility that the CDW state below T_{1} disappears at p_{1}, above which only a weak anomaly at T_{2} is observed. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the CDW state observed at ambient pressure and room temperature persists upon the application of pressure, and it may be that the transition at T_{2} lies beneath a CDW transition at higher temperatures. At p_{2}, a different CDW state may emerge. However, while CDW states generally compete with superconductivity, in this instance the emergence of the transition at T_{4} leads to a significant enhancement of T_{c}, rather than a decrease. The dramatic change in both \rho_{0} and the A coefficient at p_{2} suggests that this may correspond to a sudden change in the electronic structure and Fermi surface topology. Such changes may lead to an enhanced density of states, which in turn may cause the significant increase of T_{c} and A.

The transition at T_{3}, which appears under T_{4} up to around 19 kbar, may then correspond to a further lowering of the crystal symmetry or a change in the modulation vector \mathbf{q} of the CDW state. A change of \mathbf{q} can lead to different behavior of the resistivity since this changes the reconstructed Fermi surface, with the CDW gap opening across different regions. However, for these scenarios it would be unusual that there is little change in T_{c} upon the disappearance of T_{3}. As previously discussed, at ambient pressure there is a structural distortion at T_{1} corresponding to a significantly increased orthorhombicity. Since both T_{3} and T_{4} have a similar first-order nature, whether these transitions correspond to changes in either the crystal symmetry or structural parameters needs to be checked with XRD measurements under pressure. All these results suggest the presence of both structural and electronic instabilities in the temperature-pressure phase diagram. In light of the recent evidence that the nematic order in the iron-pnictide-based superconductors is driven by electronic rather than structural instabilities [20], it will be of interest to determine whether any of the transitions or structural changes in BaPt_{2}As_{2} also have an electronic origin. The relationship between the high-temperature transitions and the superconductivity also needs to be further investigated and compared to both the cuprate- and iron-based materials, but the significantly lower values of T_{c} may be a result of the lack of a spin fluctuation mediated pairing mechanism.

In conclusion, using single-crystal XRD measurements, we have identified that a CDW state exists in BaPt_{2}As_{2} in ambient conditions, and that the transition at T_{1}=275 K corresponds to a change of the superlattice structure. The application of pressure results in a rich phase diagram. Pressure suppresses the CDW transition at T_{1} until it disappears at around p_{1}=7 kbar, which leads to an enhancement of T_{c}. Upon further increasing the pressure, new high-temperature transitions are observed in the resistivity, which are correlated with an additional increase of T_{c}. Since these results indicate the presence of multiple instabilities at high temperatures, BaPt_{2}As_{2} may provide a platform for studying the competition between different interactions and their interplay with superconductivity. Further experiments such as NMR and XRD under pressure, as well as theoretical calculations, are needed

###### Abstract

The recently discovered BaPt_{2}As_{2} shows a structural distortion at around 275 K, followed by the emergence of superconductivity at lower temperatures. Here we identify the presence of charge-density-wave order at room temperature and ambient pressure using single-crystal x-ray diffraction, with both a superlattice and an incommensurate modulation, where there is a change of the superlattice structure below \simeq275 K. Upon applying pressure, BaPt_{2}As_{2} shows a rich temperature-pressure phase diagram with multiple pressure-induced transitions at high temperatures, the emergence of disappearance of which are correlated with sudden changes in the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}. These findings demonstrate that BaPt_{2}As_{2} is a promising system for studying competing interactions and the relationship between high-temperature electronic instabilities and superconductivity.

## I Introduction

The presence of competing interactions and multiple electronic instabilities often leads to emergent phenomena and new phases. In particular, the complex relationship between superconductivity and magnetic or charge order has attracted considerable interest. In many of the high-temperature iron-pnictide superconductors, the superconductivity occurs in the vicinity of spin-density-wave (SDW) order [1, 2]. Meanwhile, upon applying pressure to the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCu_{2}Si_{2}[3], evidence was found of superconductivity being in close proximity to multiple instabilities, with one superconducting dome in the vicinity of magnetic order and another near a possible valence instability [4, 5, 6]. The interplay between charge-density-wave (CDW) order and superconductivity has also been of particular interest recently [7, 8], mainly due to the coexistence of these competing phases in some systems, with a similar phase diagram to systems with SDW and superconductivity [9], as well as the observation of CDW in high-temperature cuprate superconductors. In the cuprates, the role of CDW order in the formation of superconductivity remains a central and open issue [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], but the microscopic relationship is still unresolved.

Structural distortions have also been found to occur in various iron-based superconductors [16]. For instance, upon lowering the temperature of electron-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}, the symmetry of the crystal lattice is reduced from the fourfold symmetry of the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure to a twofold symmetric orthorhombic structure, while SDW ordering onsets at lower temperatures [17, 18]. There is an increasing body of evidence that this distortion does not arise due to phonons [19], but is from an electronic instability, the nematic order, which may be driven by either spin or orbital fluctuations [20]. The suppression of both nematicity and SDW ordering in the region of the superconducting dome again indicates the importance of understanding the relationship between the various ordered phases and the underlying interactions. On the other hand, there also exist some non-iron-based 122 pnictide superconductors RT_{2}Pn_{2} (R= Ba or Sr, T denotes transition metal, and Pn denotes pnictogen) that undergo structural distortions upon cooling [21, 22, 23]. A comparison with the iron-based materials may provide crucial insights into the roles of various interactions and the resulting collective phenomena.

Unlike the 122 iron-pnictide superconductors, which crystallize in the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure (I4/mmm), SrPt_{2}As_{2} forms in the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure (P4/nmm) at high temperatures. Both are layered tetragonal structures, but they have different stacking of the layers of transition metal and As atoms along the c axis. A further difference from the iron pnictides is that in the Pt-based materials, spin fluctuations are not generally expected to play a significant role. Below T_{\text{CDW}}=470 K, the crystal structure of SrPt_{2}As_{2} undergoes an orthorhombic distortion and CDW ordering [24, 25, 26, 27], with a superconducting transition at a lower temperature of 5.2 K [22]. Similarly, in the newly discovered BaPt_{2}As_{2} with a resistive transition at T_{c}=1.67 K [28], a first-order phase transition appears at about 275 K, at which a structural phase transition from the tetragonal CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure to an orthorhombic structure was found using powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) [28]. In this article, we demonstrate using single-crystal XRD measurements that a CDW state already exists at room temperature in BaPt_{2}As_{2}, and the structural transition at T_{1}\simeq 275 K corresponds to a change in the CDW superlattice. To study the relationship between superconductivity and the CDW state, we performed resistivity measurements under pressure, which reveal a rich temperature-pressure phase diagram with multiple pressure-induced transitions, the emergence of which are correlated with sudden changes in T_{c}.

 

## II Experimental Methods

Single crystals of BaPt_{2}As_{2} were synthesized using a self-flux method described in Ref. [28]. Resistivity measurements under pressure were carried out using a piston-cylinder-type pressure cell up to 27 kbar, and Daphne 7373 was used as the pressure-transmitting medium to ensure hydrostaticity. The applied pressure was determined by the shift in T_{c} of a high-quality Pb single crystal. Measurements were performed using a Physical Property Measurement System (Quantum Design PPMS-14T) in the temperature range of 2-300 K, while measurements from 0.3 to 5 K were performed using a ^{3}He refrigerator. Single-crystal XRD from room temperature to 100 K was carried out on a STOE IPDS II diffractometer at the Argonne National Laboratory, using an Mo source (\lambda = 0.710 73 A). Reciprocal space reconstruction of the single-crystal XRD data was performed with the software x-area.

## III Results

### Single-crystal x-ray diffraction

A simulation of the diffraction peaks in the (hk0) plane for the tetragonal CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure (P4/nmm) is shown in Fig. 1(a), while the reciprocal space reconstruction of single-crystal XRD data at 300 and 100 K is shown in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c), respectively. Reflections are labeled with the Miller indices of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure (P4/nmm).

In the previous powder XRD measurements [28], we reported a structural phase transition at 275 K from a tetragonal CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure to an orthorhombic one. Based on the current single-crystal XRD results, it should be noted that neither the reflections at 300 K nor those at 100 K could be satisfactorily indexed with a perfect CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type crystal structure. From comparing the experimental data at both 300 and 100 K with the simulated reflections, we observe a number of additional peaks arising from complex CDW modulations. If we index the single-crystal XRD data by introducing an orthorhombic distortion, the lattice parameters at 300 K are a = 4.5608(10) A, b = 4.5643(12) A, and c = 10.0420(20) A, while at 100 K they are a = 4.5489(9) A, b = 4.5700(11) A, and c = 10.0192(22) A. These results indicate that even at room temperature, the CDW modulations induce a small difference in a and b, which becomes larger below 280 K. Subsequent analysis of the data at 300 K reveals peaks corresponding to 2 x 2 x 2 superlattice structure, where the unit cell is doubled in all directions, along with an incommensurate modulation \mathbf{q_{1}} = (0.1,0.3,0). Reflections that are forbidden for the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure, such as (1,0,0) and (0,1,0), and the half-fractional peaks such as (-1/2, -1/2,0) arise from the 2 x 2 x superlattice structure, while the peaks at the position of (0.1,0.3,0) around the superlattice peaks arise from the incommensurate modulation. A comparison of the data from 300 to 285 K shows no change in the structure of BaPt_{2}As_{2}. From 280 to 100 K, BaPt_{2}As_{2} enters a new phase in which the symmetry further lowers to a 6 x 6 x 2 superlattice structure while the incommensurate modulation \mathbf{q_{1}} remains the same, as indicated by the appearance of new fractional peaks such as (2/3,0,0) and (0,2/3,0). Therefore, these results demonstrate that the CDW state is already present at room temperature, but there is a change in CDW structure below 280 K, along with an increased orthorhombic distortion.

### Resistivity under pressure

The temperature-pressure phase diagram of BaPt_{2}As_{2} was determined by measuring the resistivity under pressure. As shown in Fig. 2(a), at p = 3 kbar there is a sudden increase of the resistivity upon cooling at about T_{1}\simeq 250 K, which is similar to the previously reported results at ambient pressure [28], and it corresponds to a change of the CDW structure. With increasing pressure, the temperature of this transition decreases before abruptly disappearing above p_{1}\simeq 7 kbar. After T_{1} disappears, a new transition labeled T_{2} is observed, where there is only a small anomaly in the resistivity and little change with increasing pressure. For pressures greater than p_{2}\simeq 17 kbar, T_{2} disappears and two new transitions

Figure 1: Reciprocal space reconstruction of single-crystal XRD. (a) Simulated diffraction peaks in the (hk0) plane of reciprocal space for the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure. Reciprocal space reconstruction of the single-crystal XRD data collected at (b) 300 K and (c) 100 K. At 300 K, other than the simulated peaks of the CaBe_{2}Ge_{2}-type structure, there are satellite peaks which can be indexed with a 2 × 2 × 2 superlattice and an incommensurate modulation with a propagation vector \mathbf{q_{i}} = (0.1,0.3,0). At 100 K, additional satellite peaks corresponding to a 6 × 6 × 2 superlattice are observed.

 emerge at T_{3} and T_{4}, with the former corresponding to an increase of the resistivity upon cooling, while the latter shows a sudden decrease. These transitions have a different pressure dependence, with the lower transition T_{3} being rapidly suppressed with increasing pressure while T_{4} increases with pressure. Note that apart from T_{2}, all the transitions display pronounced hysteresis, as shown in Figs. 2(b)-2(d), indicating a first-order nature. It can also be seen that there is an increase in resistivity at T_{1} and T_{3} while it drops at T_{4}.

Figure 3(a) displays the resistivity under pressure at low temperatures in the vicinity of the superconducting transitions. At ambient pressure, T_{c} is about 1.6 K, determined from where the resistivity reaches 50% of the normal state value \rho_{0}\simeq 174\,\mu\Omega cm, similar to that previously reported [28]. With increasing pressure, the superconducting transition sharpens and T_{c} undergoes a moderate enhancement at around 7 kbar, which is close to p_{1}, to around 2 K, along with a small decrease of \rho_{0}. Further increasing the pressure up to 13 kbar results in little change of T_{c}. However, upon applying pressures greater than 13 kbar, there is another jump in T_{c} that is larger in size, reaching a near constant value above 17 kbar. The superconducting transition at 17 kbar is significantly broader than that at both lower and higher pressures, which may be due to a pressure inhomogeneity, leading to the coexistence of both superconducting phases. The newly emerged superconducting phase has the highest T_{c}\simeq 3.8 K, the lowest residual resistivity in the normal state, and T_{c} changes little with pressure up to 26 kbar. The upper critical field H_{c2}(T) at different pressures is shown in Fig. 3(b). The values of H_{c2} were measured in three regions of the temperature-pressure phase diagram (0, 7, and 19 kbar), and they were normalized by the product of T_{c} and the derivative of H_{c2} near T_{c}. When the normalized H_{c2} is plotted as a function of T/T_{c}, all the data fall on one curve, in good agreement with the orbital limited values of H_{c2} calculated using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) model shown by the dashed line [29]. This suggests that there is no change of the superconducting pairing state under pressure, and that orbital limiting rather than Pauli limiting is the dominant pair breaking mechanism. Meanwhile, as displayed in Fig. 4, the low-temperature normal state resistivity could be well fitted with Fermi liquid behavior, \rho(T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{2}.

Figure 5(a) displays the temperature-pressure phase diagram obtained from resistivity measurements. Two abrupt enhancements of T_{c} occur under pressure, both of which clearly coincide with changes in the high-temperature phase transitions. At p_{1}\simeq 7 kbar, the CDW transition at T_{1} disappears and a new transition T_{2} is observed. This change is accompanied by an enhancement of T_{c}. Upon further increasing the applied pressure, there is little change of T_{2} up to p_{2}\simeq 17 kbar, where the transition at T_{2} is no longer observed

Figure 2: (a) Temperature dependence of the resistivity of BaPt_{2}As_{2} at various pressures. The different high-temperature transitions are denoted by T_{1}, T_{2}, T_{3}, and T_{4}. The resistivity upon warming and cooling is shown in the vicinity of (b) T_{1} at 4 kbar, (c) T_{2} at 9 kbar, and (d) T_{3} and T_{4} at 17 kbar. In (c) the derivative d\rho/dT is also shown by the solid line, which shows a clear change at T_{2}.

  and two new phase transitions emerge. The transition at T_{3} decreases with increasing pressure before being suppressed at less than 22 kbar, while T_{4} increases with pressure, reaching 290 K at 24 kbar. The appearance of these transitions is accompanied by another pronounced enhancement of T_{c} by almost a factor of 2. The critical pressure for the emergence of T_{3} and T_{4} is slightly lower than that corresponding to the jump in T_{c}. This may be due to the variation in the pressure transmitted by the Daphne 7373 medium with temperature, which can cause a pressure decrease of around 1-2 kbar between 300 K and low temperatures [30]. Furthermore, the results from fitting the resistivity in the normal state are shown in Fig. 5(b). Each steplike increase of T_{c} coincides with a drop in \rho_{0}, with a small decrease at the disappearance of T_{1} and a larger drop at the emergence of T_{3} and T_{4}. Meanwhile, the resistivity coefficient A undergoes a sharp drop at p_{1} followed by a sudden increase at p_{2}. Furthermore, neither \rho_{0} nor A displays any noticeable anomaly upon the disappearance of the transition at T_{3}.

## IV Discussion and Summary

The above results demonstrate an intricate relationship between the superconductivity and the high-temperature transitions in BaPt_{2}As_{2}. The nature of the transitions at T_{2}, T_{3}, and T_{4} is yet to be uncovered. In comparison, SrPt_{2}As_{2} undergoes a structural phase transition below T_{\rm CDW}=470 K, from a tetragonal to orthorhombic structure [25], with two incommensurate CDW modulations emerging [24, 26]. However, in BaPt_{2}As_{2} at ambient pressure the orthorhombic distortion and CDW modulation already exist above T_{1}, and this transition corresponds to a change of the periodicity of the superlattice. Furthermore, there is a sudden increase in the resistivity at T_{1} as in the case of the structural transition in SrNi_{2}P_{2}[31], whereas there is a drop in the resistivity at T_{\rm CDW} in SrPt_{2}As_{2}. However, the behavior of BaPt_{2}As_{2} above 22 kbar more strongly resembles that of SrPt_{2}As_{2}, since we observe a drop in the resistivity at T_{4} and there is a comparable value of T_{c}.

If then the transition under pressure at T_{4} is similar to that of SrPt_{2}As_{2} at ambient pressure, the differences in the CDW modulation and high-temperature crystal structures may explain the different behavior of the resistivity seen at T_{1} and T_{4}. This suggests the possibility that the CDW state below T_{1} disappears at p_{1}, above which only a weak anomaly at T_{2} is observed. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the CDW state observed at ambient pressure and room temperature persists upon the application of pressure, and it may be that the transition at T_{2} lies beneath a CDW transition at higher temperatures. At p_{2}, a different CDW state may emerge. However, while CDW states generally compete with superconductivity, in this instance the emergence of the transition at T_{4} leads to a significant enhancement of T_{c}, rather than a decrease. The dramatic change in both \rho_{0} and the A coefficient at p_{2} suggests that this may correspond to a sudden change in the electronic structure and Fermi surface topology. Such changes may lead to an enhanced density of states, which in turn may cause the significant increase of T_{c} and A.

The transition at T_{3}, which appears under T_{4} up to around 19 kbar, may then correspond to a further lowering of the crystal symmetry or a change in the modulation vector \mathbf{q} of the CDW state. A change of \mathbf{q} can lead to different behavior of the resistivity since this changes the reconstructed Fermi surface, with the CDW gap opening across different regions. However, for these scenarios it would be unusual that there is little change in T_{c} upon the disappearance of T_{3}. As previously discussed, at ambient pressure there is a structural distortion at T_{1} corresponding to a significantly increased orthorhombicity. Since both T_{3} and T_{4} have a similar first-order nature, whether these transitions correspond to changes in either the crystal symmetry or structural parameters needs to be checked with XRD measurements under pressure. All these results suggest the presence of both structural and electronic instabilities in the temperature-pressure phase diagram. In light of the recent evidence that the nematic order in the iron-pnictide-based superconductors is driven by electronic rather than structural instabilities [20], it will be of interest to determine whether any of the transitions or structural changes in BaPt_{2}As_{2} also have an electronic origin. The relationship between the high-temperature transitions and the superconductivity also needs to be further investigated and compared to both the cuprate- and iron-based materials, but the significantly lower values of T_{c} may be a result of the lack of a spin fluctuation mediated pairing mechanism.

In conclusion, using single-crystal XRD measurements, we have identified that a CDW state exists in BaPt_{2}As_{2} in ambient conditions, and that the transition at T_{1}=275 K corresponds to a change of the superlattice structure. The application of pressure results in a rich phase diagram. Pressure suppresses the CDW transition at T_{1} until it disappears at around p_{1}=7 kbar, which leads to an enhancement of T_{c}. Upon further increasing the pressure, new high-temperature transitions are observed in the resistivity, which are correlated with an additional increase of T_{c}. Since these results indicate the presence of multiple instabilities at high temperatures, BaPt_{2}As_{2} may provide a platform for studying the competition between different interactions and their interplay with superconductivity. Further experiments such as NMR and XRD under pressure, as well as theoretical calculations, are needed
