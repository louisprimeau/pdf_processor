###### Abstract

A suppression of superconductivity in the late rare-earth _R_FeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} materials is reported. The maximum critical temperature (T_{c}) decreases from 51 K for R =Tb to 36 K for HoFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1}, which has been synthesized under 10 GPa pressure. This suppression is driven by a decrease in the Fe-As-Fe angle below an optimum value of 110.6^{\circ}, as the angle decreases linearly with unit-cell volume (V) across the _R_FeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} series. A crossover in electronic structure around this optimum geometry is evidenced by a change in sign of the compositional dT_{c}/dV, from negative values for previously reported large R materials to positive for HoFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1}.

Rare earth (_R_) oxypnictides _R_FeAsO (Ref. 1) were recently discovered to superconduct when doped, with critical temperatures surpassed only by the high-T_{c} cuprates. Several families of superconducting iron pnictides have subsequently been discovered.^{2} These all have layered structures containing AsFeAs slabs with Fe tetrahedrally coordinated by As. The main types are the 1111 materials based on _R_FeAsO or _R_FeAsF (_M_=Ca,Sr,Ba), the 122 phases _M_Fe_{2}As_{2}, and the 111 AFeAs (_A_ = Li,Na) family. The related binaries FeX (_X_ = Se,Te) are also superconducting.

The electron-doped 1111 materials _R_FeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} and _R_FeAsO_{1-\delta} materials remain prominent as they have the highest T_{c}'s, up to 56 K, and allow lattice and doping effects to be investigated through variations in the _R^{3+}_ cation size and the anion composition. A strong lattice effect is evident at the start of the rare-earth series, as T_{c} rises from 26 K for LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} to 43 K under pressure,^{3,4} and to a near-constant maximum 50-56 K in the _R_FeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} and _R_FeAsO_{1-\delta} series for R = Pr to Gd,^{5-10} but whether lattice effects ultimately enhance or suppress superconductivity for the late _R_'s has been unclear. The late rare-earth _R_FeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} materials and the oxygen-deficient _R_FeAsO_{1-\delta} superconductors require high-pressure synthesis, leading to significant challenges as single phase samples are difficult to prepare, and accurate analyses of cation stoichiometries and O and F contents are difficult. To investigate the effect of the lattice for later R, we have synthesized multiple samples of _R_FeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} (_R_ = Tb, Dy, and Ho) under varying high-pressure conditions. Here we report superconductivity in HoFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} for which the maximum T_{c} of 36 K is markedly lower than in the previous R analogs. This is part of a systematic suppression of superconductivity by the smaller, late R cations. HoFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} also shows a reversal in the sign of the compositional dT_{c}/dV (V=unit-cell volume) compared to the early R materials, confirming that the decreasing R size has a significant effect on the bands contributing to the Fermi surface.

Polycrystalline ceramic _R_FeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} samples (_R_ = Tb, Dy, and Ho) were synthesized by a high-pressure method and investigated by powder x-ray diffraction, magnetization, and conductivity measurements.^{11} Initial results for _R_FeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} (_R_ = Tb and Dy) were published elsewhere.^{12} Both materials were found to be superconducting with maximum T_{c}'s of 46 and 45 K, respectively. Little difference in superconducting properties between samples with nominal compositions of x = 0.1 and 0.2 were observed, and the x = 0.2 materials were generally of lower phase purity, and so the x = 0.1 composition was used in subsequent syntheses. The best samples typically contain \sim80% by mass of the superconducting phase with residual nonsuperconducting R_{2}O_{3} and _R_As phases also present. The sample purity and superconducting properties are not sensitive to synthesis pressure over a range that moves to higher pressures as R decreases in size; R = Tb and Dy superconductors were respectively prepared at 7-10 and 8-12 GPa, heating at 1050-1100 ^{\circ}C. Repeated syntheses of TbFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} gave several samples with higher T_{c}'s than the above value, the highest value is T_{c}(max)=51 K (Fig. 1). Further DyFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} samples did not show higher transitions than before, so we conclude that T_{c}(max) in this system is 45 K.

Tetragonal HoFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} was obtained from reactions at 10 GPa pressure and the properties of six HoFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} samples prepared under varying conditions are summarized

  in Table 1. Crystal structure refinements and phase analysis were carried out by fitting powder x-ray diffraction data (Fig. 2).[13] Magnetization measurements demonstrate that all six HoFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} samples are bulk superconductors with T_{c}'s of 29-36 K (Fig. 3). Resistivities show smooth high-temperature evolutions without apparent spin-density wave anomalies. The transitions to the zero resistance state have widths of less than 4 K.

Although all of the samples in Table 1 have the same starting composition, small variations in synthesis pressure and temperature result in a dispersion in x around the nominal 0.1 value for the HoFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} phase and corresponding variations in superconducting properties. T_{c} increases to a maximum value, T_{c}(max), at the upper solubility limit of x in RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} systems,[7] and this is consistent with the observation that the superconducting phases in samples 1, 3, and 4, which are heated at high temperatures or for longer times and so are likely to have a slightly lower F content, have lower T_{c}'s (average 32.1 K) than the other three samples, made under nominally identical "optimum" conditions, which have average T_{c}=34.8 K. Sample 6 shows the highest T_{c}=36.2 K and the lowest proportion of the HoFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} phase and a correspondingly low diamagnetic volume fraction. This demonstrates that the sample is at the upper limit of the superconducting composition range and so gives a realistic T_{c}(max) for the HoFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} system.

Although the doping values x for the high-pressure RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} samples are not known precisely, comparing ensembles of samples with similar phase purities made under similar conditions reveals a clear suppression of superconductivity by lattice effects for heavier R. For example, all of our TbFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} superconductors have higher T_{c}'s (five TbFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} samples, T_{c}=45-51 K) than all of the HoFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} materials (in Table 1). The T_{c}(max) values of 51, 45, and 36 K for RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} with R=Tb, Dy, and Ho, respectively, thus represent the trend correctly.

Figure 4 shows a plot of the maximum critical temperatures, T_{c}(max), against unit-cell volume for many reported RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} and RFeAsO_{1-x}S systems and our above materials. T_{c}(max) rises slowly as cell volume decreases for R =La to Pr and then shows a broad maximum, between R =Pr and Tb in the RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} materials, before falling rapidly as R changes from Tb to Dy to Ho. This trend is not seen in the reported RFeAsO_{1-x} superconductors, where T_{c}(max) remains approximately constant,[14, 15] apparently because they have larger cell volumes than their RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} analogs (see Fig. 4).

The size of the R^{3+} cation tunes the electronic properties through variations in the geometry of the FeAs slab. A trend between the As-Fe-As (or equivalent Fe-As-Fe) angle and T_{c} has been reported for the early R materials.[16] The upper panel of Fig. 4 shows representative reported values for optimal RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} superconductors including our R=Tb, Dy, and Ho materials. This demonstrates that the angle decreases monotonically with R size and so does not show a universal correlation with T_{c}(max). The T_{c}(max) variation in the RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} series is described by a simple cos(\phi - \phi_{0}) function, shown in Fig. 4, where the value of the As

All five of the Fe 3d bands are partially occupied and contribute to the Fermi surface of the iron arsenide superconductors through hybridization with As 4s and 4p states.[17] Decreasing the tetrahedral angle through 109.5^{\circ} marks the crossover from tetragonal compression to elongation of the FeAs_{4} tetrahedra. In a crystal-field model, this reverses the splittings of the t_{2} and ed-orbital sets and so a significant crossover in the real electronic structure is likely to occur near 109.5^{\circ}.

Evidence for the above crossover also comes from a discovered change in the sign of the compositional dT_{c}/dV near optimum doping in the RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} systems.[18] The unit-cell parameters and volume for the six HoFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} samples in Table 1 show a positive correlation with T_{c} (Fig. 5), in contrast to early R=La (Ref. [19]) and Sm (Ref. [7]) analogs, where lattice parameters and volume decease with increasing T_{c}. The T_{c},V points for near-optimally doped R=La, Sm, and Ho RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} superconductors are shown in Fig. 4 together with the derived dT_{c}/dV values. dT_{c}/dV for a single RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} system follows the overall trend in dT_{c}({\rm max})/dV for different R's, changing from a negative value at large R=La to a small positive slope at R=Ho.

The compositional dT_{c}/dV for a given RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} system reflects two competing effects of variations in the fluoride content x on the lattice volume. F- is slightly smaller than O^{2-} so the anion substitution effect gives a negative contribution to the compositional dT_{c}/dV, independent of R. The concomitant effect of doping electrons into the Fe d bands tends to expand the lattice (and increase T_{c}), but the magnitude of this positive dT_{c}/dV term depends on the nature of the bands at the Fermi surface. The observed shift from negative to positive dT_{c}/dV as R changes from La to Ho shows that the decreasing size of the R^{3+} cation leads to significant changes in the Fermi surface, with volume-expanding (antibonding) bands more prominent for smaller R. Calculations have confirmed that the electronic structure near the Fermi level is sensitive to such small changes in the As z coordinate (equivalent to changing the Fe-As-Fe angle).[20] Small changes in the contributions of the d bands are likely to be particularly important in a multigap scenario for superconductivity, as evidenced in gap measurements of TbFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} and other iron arsenide materials.[21]

In summary, our analysis of multiple samples of RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} (R=Tb, Dy, and Ho) superconductors demonstrates that the maximum critical temperature falls from 51 K for R=Tb to 36 K for the previously unreported Ho analog. Hence, the effect on the lattice of substituting smaller late rare earths in the RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} lattice suppresses superconductivity. This lattice control appears to be through tuning of the interatomic angles in the FeAs layer, with the optimum angle being 110.6^{\circ}, near the ideal tetrahedral value. The compositional dT_{c}/dV changes sign around the optimum angle evidencing significant changes in the Fermi surface. It appears difficult to increase the critical temperatures above 56 K in 1111 type iron arsenide materials through tuning lattice effects, although the possibility of higher T_{c}'s in other structure types remains open.

###### Abstract

A suppression of superconductivity in the late rare-earth _R_FeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} materials is reported. The maximum critical temperature (T_{c}) decreases from 51 K for R =Tb to 36 K for HoFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1}, which has been synthesized under 10 GPa pressure. This suppression is driven by a decrease in the Fe-As-Fe angle below an optimum value of 110.6^{\circ}, as the angle decreases linearly with unit-cell volume (V) across the _R_FeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} series. A crossover in electronic structure around this optimum geometry is evidenced by a change in sign of the compositional dT_{c}/dV, from negative values for previously reported large R materials to positive for HoFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1}.

The related binaries FeX (_X_ = Se,Te) are also superconducting.

The electron-doped 1111 materials _R_FeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} and _R_FeAsO_{1-\delta} materials remain prominent as they have the highest T_{c}'s, up to 56 K, and allow lattice and doping effects to be investigated through variations in the _R^{3+}_ cation size and the anion composition. A strong lattice effect is evident at the start of the rare-earth series, as T_{c} rises from 26 K for LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} to 43 K under pressure,^{3,4} and to a near-constant maximum 50-56 K in the _R_FeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} and _R_FeAsO_{1-\delta} series for R = Pr to Gd,^{5-10} but whether lattice effects ultimately enhance or suppress superconductivity for the late _R_'s has been unclear. The late rare-earth _R_FeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} materials and the oxygen-deficient _R_FeAsO_{1-\delta} superconductors require high-pressure synthesis, leading to significant challenges as single phase samples are difficult to prepare, and accurate analyses of cation stoichiometries and O and F contents are difficult. To investigate the effect of the lattice for later R, we have synthesized multiple samples of _R_FeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} (_R_ = Tb, Dy, and Ho) under varying high-pressure conditions. Here we report superconductivity in HoFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} for which the maximum T_{c} of 36 K is markedly lower than in the previous R analogs. This is part of a systematic suppression of superconductivity by the smaller, late R cations. HoFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} also shows a reversal in the sign of the compositional dT_{c}/dV (V=unit-cell volume) compared to the early R materials, confirming that the decreasing R size has a significant effect on the bands contributing to the Fermi surface.

Little difference in superconducting properties between samples with nominal compositions of x = 0.1 and 0.2 were observed, and the x = 0.2 materials were generally of lower phase purity, and so the x = 0.1 composition was used in subsequent syntheses. The best samples typically contain \sim80% by mass of the superconducting phase with residual nonsuperconducting R_{2}O_{3} and _R_As phases also present. The sample purity and superconducting properties are not sensitive to synthesis pressure over a range that moves to higher pressures as R decreases in size; R = Tb and Dy superconductors were respectively prepared at 7-10 and 8-12 GPa, heating at 1050-1100 ^{\circ}C. Repeated syntheses of TbFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} gave several samples with higher T_{c}'s than the above value, the highest value is T_{c}(max)=51 K (Fig. 1). Further DyFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} samples did not show higher transitions than before, so we conclude that T_{c}(max) in this system is 45 K.

Tetragonal HoFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} was obtained from reactions at 10 GPa pressure and the properties of six HoFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} samples prepared under varying conditions are summarized

Figure 1: Resistivity and (inset) susceptibility data for an optimum sample of TbFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1}, showing a sharp superconducting transition at T_{c}=51 K. The sample was prepared at 7 GPa and 1050 ^{\circ}C.

  in Table 1. Crystal structure refinements and phase analysis were carried out by fitting powder x-ray diffraction data (Fig. 2).[13] Magnetization measurements demonstrate that all six HoFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} samples are bulk superconductors with T_{c}'s of 29-36 K (Fig. 3). Resistivities show smooth high-temperature evolutions without apparent spin-density wave anomalies. The transitions to the zero resistance state have widths of less than 4 K.

Although all of the samples in Table 1 have the same starting composition, small variations in synthesis pressure and temperature result in a dispersion in x around the nominal 0.1 value for the HoFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} phase and corresponding variations in superconducting properties. T_{c} increases to a maximum value, T_{c}(max), at the upper solubility limit of x in RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} systems,[7] and this is consistent with the observation that the superconducting phases in samples 1, 3, and 4, which are heated at high temperatures or for longer times and so are likely to have a slightly lower F content, have lower T_{c}'s (average 32.1 K) than the other three samples, made under nominally identical "optimum" conditions, which have average T_{c}=34.8 K. Sample 6 shows the highest T_{c}=36.2 K and the lowest proportion of the HoFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} phase and a correspondingly low diamagnetic volume fraction. This demonstrates that the sample is at the upper limit of the superconducting composition range and so gives a realistic T_{c}(max) for the HoFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} system.

Although the doping values x for the high-pressure RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} samples are not known precisely, comparing ensembles of samples with similar phase purities made under similar conditions reveals a clear suppression of superconductivity by lattice effects for heavier R. For example, all of our TbFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} superconductors have higher T_{c}'s (five TbFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} samples, T_{c}=45-51 K) than all of the HoFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} materials (in Table 1). The T_{c}(max) values of 51, 45, and 36 K for RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} with R=Tb, Dy, and Ho, respectively, thus represent the trend correctly.

Figure 4 shows a plot of the maximum critical temperatures, T_{c}(max), against unit-cell volume for many reported RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} and RFeAsO_{1-x}S systems and our above materials. T_{c}(max) rises slowly as cell volume decreases for R =La to Pr and then shows a broad maximum, between R =Pr and Tb in the RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} materials, before falling rapidly as R changes from Tb to Dy to Ho. This trend is not seen in the reported RFeAsO_{1-x} superconductors, where T_{c}(max) remains approximately constant,[14, 15] apparently because they have larger cell volumes than their RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} analogs (see Fig. 4).

The size of the R^{3+} cation tunes the electronic properties through variations in the geometry of the FeAs slab. A trend between the As-Fe-As (or equivalent Fe-As-Fe) angle and T_{c} has been reported for the early R materials.[16] The upper panel of Fig. 4 shows representative reported values for optimal RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} superconductors including our R=Tb, Dy, and Ho materials. This demonstrates that the angle decreases monotonically with R size and so does not show a universal correlation with T_{c}(max). The T_{c}(max) variation in the RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} series is described by a simple cos(\phi - \phi_{0}) function, shown in Fig. 4, where the value of the As

All five of the Fe 3d bands are partially occupied and contribute to the Fermi surface of the iron arsenide superconductors through hybridization with As 4s and 4p states.[17] Decreasing the tetrahedral angle through 109.5^{\circ} marks the crossover from tetragonal compression to elongation of the FeAs_{4} tetrahedra. In a crystal-field model, this reverses the splittings of the t_{2} and ed-orbital sets and so a significant crossover in the real electronic structure is likely to occur near 109.5^{\circ}.

Evidence for the above crossover also comes from a discovered change in the sign of the compositional dT_{c}/dV near optimum doping in the RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} systems.[18] The unit-cell parameters and volume for the six HoFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} samples in Table 1 show a positive correlation with T_{c} (Fig. 5), in contrast to early R=La (Ref. [19]) and Sm (Ref. [7]) analogs, where lattice parameters and volume decease with increasing T_{c}. The T_{c},V points for near-optimally doped R=La, Sm, and Ho RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} superconductors are shown in Fig. 4 together with the derived dT_{c}/dV values. dT_{c}/dV for a single RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} system follows the overall trend in dT_{c}({\rm max})/dV for different R's, changing from a negative value at large R=La to a small positive slope at R=Ho.

The compositional dT_{c}/dV for a given RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} system reflects two competing effects of variations in the fluoride content x on the lattice volume. F- is slightly smaller than O^{2-} so the anion substitution effect gives a negative contribution to the compositional dT_{c}/dV, independent of R. The concomitant effect of doping electrons into the Fe d bands tends to expand the lattice (and increase T_{c}), but the magnitude of this positive dT_{c}/dV term depends on the nature of the bands at the Fermi surface. The observed shift from negative to positive dT_{c}/dV as R changes from La to Ho shows that the decreasing size of the R^{3+} cation leads to significant changes in the Fermi surface, with volume-expanding (antibonding) bands more prominent for smaller R. Calculations have confirmed that the electronic structure near the Fermi level is sensitive to such small changes in the As z coordinate (equivalent to changing the Fe-As-Fe angle).[20] Small changes in the contributions of the d bands are likely to be particularly important in a multigap scenario for superconductivity, as evidenced in gap measurements of TbFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} and other iron arsenide materials.[21]

In summary, our analysis of multiple samples of RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} (R=Tb, Dy, and Ho) superconductors demonstrates that the maximum critical temperature falls from 51 K for R=Tb to 36 K for the previously unreported Ho analog. Hence, the effect on the lattice of substituting smaller late rare earths in the RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} lattice suppresses superconductivity. This lattice control appears to be through tuning of the interatomic angles in the FeAs layer, with the optimum angle being 110.6^{\circ}, near the ideal tetrahedral value. The compositional dT_{c}/dV changes sign around the optimum angle evidencing significant changes in the Fermi surface. It appears difficult to increase the critical temperatures above 56 K in 1111 type iron arsenide materials through tuning lattice effects, although the possibility of higher T_{c}'s in other structure types remains open.
