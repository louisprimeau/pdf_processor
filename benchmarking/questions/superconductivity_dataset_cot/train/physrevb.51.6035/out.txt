###### Abstract

Reversible-magnetization data have been studied for YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} in order to determine the thermodynamic properties and the magnetic-field dependence of the superfluid density. By fitting the Hao-Clem variational model to the reversible magnetization data below T_{c}, superconducting parameters such as the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa, the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}, and the superconducting order parameter are determined. The upper and lower critical fields H_{c2}, H_{c1}, the penetration depth \lambda, and the coherence length \xi are derived. Within the model there is a direct connection between the magnetization and the superfluid density, so the vortex structure, the behavior of the average order parameter in (H,T) plane, and the magnetic-field dependence of the superfluid density are obtained. In the high-field region, the evidence of strong vortex fluctuation effects is observed and explained by vortex fluctuation for a three-dimensional superconductor. The mean-field transition temperature T_{e}(H) and dH_{c2}/dT near T_{c} derived from the analysis of vortex fluctuation effects are comparable with fitting results.

## I Introduction

The Hao-Clem theory has proven to be remarkably successful in describing the thermodynamic properties of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Y-123). There are several different regimes of temperature and magnetic field with different models applicable. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory is the fundamental pioneering work for isotropic classical superconductors that applies in the limit that the superconducting order parameter is not too large near T_{c}.[1] In the GL theory, a complex pseudowave function \Psi is introduced as an order parameter for the superconducting electrons and the free energy is expressed as a function of the order parameter and magnetic field. Both of these two variational parameters are used to minimize the free energy. For the high-field region H_{c2}-H\ll H_{c2}, the Abrikosov solution[2] based on the GL equations is applicable by using the fact that |\Psi|^{2} is small near H_{c2} to solve the GL equations perturbatively, where |\Psi| is the amplitude of the order parameter. The Abrikosov result, however, gives a static array of vortices and hence is not applicable to the high-T_{c} superconductors[3] where flux line lattice melting, entangled vortex structures, vortex glass behavior, and strong fluctuation effects occur. For the intermediate field H_{c1}\ll H\ll H_{c2} which most experimental magnetization data fall into, the London model[1] provides the detailed phenomenological description for extreme type-II superconductors for which the GL parameter \kappa=\lambda/\xi satisfies \kappa\gg 1, where \lambda is the penetration depth and \xi is the coherence length. In the London model, both the magnetic flux density and the supercurrent density of an isolated vortex diverge on the axis of the vortex, because the vortex core is ignored, where the order parameter suppresses to zero. Recently, Hao and Clem[4, 5] developed a variational model that includes an energy term arising from suppression of the order parameter in the vortex core. They then solved the GL-like equation numerically in the intermediate region. Successful application[4, 6] of the Hao-Clem model to the experimental M(H) data allows the GL parameter \kappa and the critical field H_{c} to be determined as fitting parameters to a variational solution for an extreme type-II superconductor, where the GL parameter satisfies the condition \kappa\gg 1 in the reversible magnetization regime.

The YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} (Y-124) structure is closely related to the Y-123 structure, except with one additional Cu-O chain per unit cell, that is, Y-124 has two CuO_{2} planes and two CuO chains in the unit cell. This leads to a longer c-lattice parameter of 27.21 A. Y-124 is characterized by an excellent thermal stability of the oxygen content, while Y-123 is strongly sensitive to the oxygen concentration changes that occur as crystals are cooled in different partial pressures of oxygen.[7] Although Y-124 is a good candidate for applications, there has been an  ambiguity in experimental determinations of fundamental physical parameters, such as the GL parameter \kappa, critical fields, and penetration depth among published results.[8, 9]

In this paper, we applied the Hao-Clem model to the reversible magnetization data in order to determine the superconducting physical parameters. Because the data fit the model well, a rather detailed picture of the vortex structure and the magnetic-field dependence of the average order parameter for a given temperature can be derived. A universal curve when plotted on the average of the square of the order parameter vs the H/H_{c2} plot as predicted in theory[10] can be obtained. Finally, the analysis of strong vortex fluctuation was carried out at higher temperatures where fluctuation models apply.

## II Experiment

About a 10-g polycrystalline sample of Y-124 was synthesized from a stoichiometric mixture of oxide of Y and Cu, and barium carbonate in air at 900 ^{\circ}C. The sample was fired several times with frequent intermediate grindings until no trace of barium carbonate could be detected in the x-ray diffraction pattern. A subsequent high pressure synthesis was done three times for 12 h in 20% O_{2} in argon at a total pressure of 2 Kbar (600 atm O_{2} pressure) at 1050 ^{\circ}C followed by slow cooling (1.5 deg/min) to room temperature. A large capacity hot isostatic press system (inside diameter = 8 cm and height = 16 cm) was used for high oxygen pressure synthesis.

Grain-aligned powders of tiny single crystals were used instead of one single crystal in order to give a larger sample and a better signal-to-noise ratio. To make a grain-aligned sample in an epoxy matrix, the bulk pellets were ground to a powder of an average diameter 12-20 \mum and mixed thoroughly with a low viscosity and low magnetic susceptibility out-gassed epoxy (EPOTEK 301) in a Teflon container. The liquid slurry was placed in magnetic fields of 8.2 T for 15 h. A flat-plate sample was prepared for the x-ray diffraction studies to test whether the c axis of the grain-aligned sample is perpendicular to the surface of the plate. Cylindrical samples were made in the same container for magnetization measurements.

The x-ray diffraction patterns of \theta-2\theta scan for an aligned sample with the c axis perpendicular to the surface is shown in Fig. 1. The _(0,0,l)_ lines are very strongly enhanced by the alignment, and the other lines are suppressed into the noise level. To obtain a more quantitative measure of the mosaic spread of the grains, a pole figure experiment indicates that the full width of half maximum for the _(0,0,_14)_ peak, FWHM, is about 1.8^{\circ}. This value for the grain-aligned Y-124 is the same as the typical values for Y-123.

All the magnetization measurements were carried out in a magnetic field applied parallel to the c axis with use of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). A 3-cm scan length was used for the field homogeneity. Both the shielding and Meissner data for the aligned sample taken at a magnetic field of 5 Oe is shown in Fig. 2, with the onset transition temperature of 81.4 K. The correction for background was made by extrapolation of a linear fit to the normal state data between 100 and 250 K.

## III Results and Discussion

### Determination of superconducting parameters

The analysis presented here is based on a fit of M(H) data constructed from a series of M(T) data at various applied magnetic fields parallel to the c-axis in the reversible regime to the Hao-Clem model. Figure 3(a) shows the fitting results of the magnetization data for the various temperatures between 68 and 74 K. As the temperature approaches 74 K, the magnetization data show small deviations from the fitting line near the high-field range because the strong fluctuation effects become important in this range. The data have been fitted two ways, first by forcing \kappa to be the average \kappa value, 70, and then by allowing \kappa to be a free parameter. With \kappa forced to be 70, all the magnetization data of Fig. 3(a) collapse to a single curve shown in Fig. 3(b). If \kappa is allowed to be a free variable, one obtains the temperature dependent \kappa shown in Fig. 4 where \kappa varies from 69 to 72. If data above 74 K are used, \kappa begins to increase as expected for

  the onset of fluctuation effects.[6] The abrupt increase of \kappa near 74 K is thought to be the result of a fluctuation effect.

Another parameter determined from this fitting is the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(T), which is shown in Fig. 5. In the limited range from 68 to 74 K, the H_{c}(T) data are linear in temperature and give T_{c} = 81.8 K and dH_{c}/dT = -102.8 Oe/K. A fit of H_{c}(T) data to the BCS temperature dependent H_{c}(T) formula given by Clem,[11]H_{c}(T)/H_{c}(0) = 1.7367[1-T/T_{c}][1- 0.2730(1-T/T_{c}) - 0.0949(1-T/T_{c})^{2}], yields H_{c}(0) = (0.53 \pm 0.01)\times10^{4} Oe with T_{c} = 81.5 K. These values are to be compared with the superconducting onset temperature, 81.4 K, measured in low field (5 Oe) M vs T data shown in Fig. 2. Values of the upper critical field derived from H_{c2} = \kappa\sqrt{2}H_{c}(T) are shown in Fig. 6. From the linear extrapolation of H_{c2}, dH_{c2}/dT and T_{c} are -1.02 T/K and 81.8 K, respectively. The slope, dH_{c2}/dT, can be also

(b) shows a scaling behavior in dimensionless units with the average \kappa = 70 and \sqrt{2}H_{c}(T) for the same range of temperature in (a). Solid lines are fitting results.

  obtained from the above equation with use of the average \kappa of 70, which yields dH_{c2}/dT = -1.018 T/K near T_{c}. These values are comparable with each other. Using the approach by Werthamer, Helland, and Hohenberg (WHH),[12]H_{c2}(0)\cong-0.7T_{c}(dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}}, which yields H_{c2}(0) = 58.1 T. The coherence length \xi can be obtained from the relation H_{c2}(0)=\phi_{0}/2\pi\xi^{2} (\phi_{0} is one flux quantum, 2.07\times10^{-7} G cm^{2}) to be 23.8 A. The penetration depth \lambda can be derived from the \kappa = \lambda/\xi to be 1666 A. To see the likely range of \lambda values it is helpful to use both clean and dirty limit relations. According to the BCS clean limit prediction[13] for \lambda(T), \lambda(T) = \lambda(0)/\sqrt{2(1-T/T_{c})} for T\longrightarrow T_{c}, we obtain \lambda(0) = 1879 A. Meanwhile, in the BCS dirty limit,[13]\lambda(T) = \lambda(0)/\sqrt{2.7(1-T/T_{c})} for T\longrightarrow T_{c}, which gives \lambda(0) = 2183 A. The value of \lambda(0) in the BCS clean limit may be in better agreement with the \lambda(0) value from \lambda = \kappa\xi relation. The lower critical field H_{c1}(0) can be derived from H_{c1} = (\phi_{0}/4\pi\lambda^{2})(ln\kappa + 0.5) to be 220 Oe.

### Vortex structure

Because the Hao-Clem model describes the data well, one can derive the values of the vortex core variables that are needed to give the measured magnetization. In the model, the order parameter is written in terms of the

\[f=f_{\infty}\frac{\rho}{(\rho^{2}+\xi_{v}^{2})^{1/2}}\ ,\] (1)

where \rho is the radial distance, f_{\infty} is the value of f at \rho = \infty and \xi_{v} governs the rise of f near the core. Once the values of H_{c} and \kappa are known, the variational parameters \xi_{v} and f_{\infty} can be determined for each value of  tions are cut at the midpoint between vortices, at a/2, and symmetrized for the nearest vortex position. Using these values, the order parameter functions derived for an array of vortices at T=71 K with the applied field H=1,3, and 5 T are shown in Fig. 7. The derivative of the order parameter is discontinuous at the boundary of the Wigner-Seitz-like cell of the vortex. To calculate average values of f and f^{2}, with the simplification that the unit cell of the vortex array may be approximated by a circular one, we introduce the average order parameter for a single vortex, defined as \langle f\rangle=(8/a^{2})\int_{0}^{a/2}f(\rho)\rho d\rho, where a is the vortex spacing. The three-dimensional surface plot of \langle f\rangle on the (H,T) plane is shown in Fig. 8. It shows the supression of the average order parameter by about 58% at 74 K and 5 T.

The density of electrons in the superconducting ground state (n_{s}) is proportional to \langle f^{2}\rangle, so we also have evaluated this quantity. Plotting the \langle f^{2}\rangle data on a reduced field plot of H/H_{c2} as in Fig. 9, it is clear that the data fall on a universal curve. Here H_{c2}=\kappa\sqrt{2}H_{c}(T) as derived from fitting the magnetization data. These data are very similar to Y-123 reported previously.[14]

Two conclusions can be drawn from Fig. 9. First, the \langle f^{2}\rangle vs H/H_{c2} curves for all temperature and field values fall on a universal curve. Second, this universal curve extrapolates linearly to H/H_{c2} as predicted by Brandt.[10]

### Fluctuation effect and high field scaling behavior of magnetization

Above 74 K, fluctuation effects become important. A remarkable aspect of the critical fluctuation in high fields is that magnetization is field independent at temperature T^{\star}. Bulaevskii _et al.[15]_ and Kogan _et al.[16]_ formulated a fluctuation theory in a layered superconductor within a Lowrence-Doniach framework, assuming H is perpendicular to the layers. In Fig. 10, all plots of 4\pi M vs T measured at fields between 1 T and 5 T cross at T^{\star}=79.2 K and 4\pi M^{\star}=-0.79 G. According to a formula, s=-4\pi k_{B}T^{\star} / (4\pi M^{\star}\phi_{0}) given by Bulaevskii _et al.[15]_ where 4\pi M^{\star} is in G and the cgs unit is used, the distance between CuO_{2} planes, s, can be estimated to be 8\times 10^{-7} cm (80 A). This value of s is larger than one (\sim 10.5 A) determined by the crystalline structure method. This disagreement may be caused by the application of the two-dimensional (2D) model to a 3D anisotropic superconductor (Y-124). The superconducting volume fraction may be another factor to affect a value of M^{\star} in the above formula. Also the fluctuational diamagnetism above the low-field onset T_{c} is observed.

The temperature and field dependence of magnetization in the transition region in high magnetic fields shows the scaling behavior given by 4\pi M/(TH)^{n}=F\{A[T-T_{c}(H)]/(TH)^{n}\}, where F is the scaling function, A is a temperature and field independent coefficient, and n is 2/3 for a 3D system and 1/2 for a 2D system. Welp _et al.[17]_ showed good 3D scaling behavior for the magnetization, electrical conductivity, Ettinghausen effect, and specific heat of Y-123 single crystals. The 2D scaling behavior was observed by Li _et al.[18, 19]_ in Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{1}0 and Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8} single crystals. With two adjustable parameters, T_{c0} and dH_{c2}/dT near T_{c}, the result of fitting is shown in Fig. 11, where 3D scaling of these magnetization data is displayed. The best fit for 3D behavior yields T_{c0}\cong 83.0\pm 0.1 K and dH_{c2}/dT\cong-1.9\pm 0.2 T/K. Less than a 10% change of dH_{c2}/dT affects a little for the best fit. The 2D scaling behavior of magnetization with any choice of T_{c0} and dH_{c2}/dT shows somewhat poor.

## IV Conclusions

The reversible magnetization of grain-aligned Y-124 has been studied with the applied fields along the c direction. A successful fitting of the Hao-Clem model to experimental M(H) data gives the results that the GL parameter \kappa is slightly decreasing up to 72 K, with the value 70 at 71 K, and starts to increase at temperature 73 K. Finally, \kappa diverges in the vicinity of T_{c}. The strong fluctuation effects cause this unusual temperature dependence of \kappa(T) near T_{c}. With the \kappa value, 70, which

  is determined by fitting the data, the derived superconducting parameters are H_{c}(0)=5225 Oe, \xi_{ab}(0)=23.8 A, \lambda_{ab}(0)=1880 A in clean limit, H_{c1}(0)=220 Oe, H_{c2}(0)=58 T, and dH_{c2}/dT=-1.02 T/K near T_{c}.

The spatial average of the order parameter and the square of the order parameter, which uses the Hao-Clem order parameter function, is in good agreement with Brandt's rather well. The plot on \langle f^{2}\rangle vs H/H_{c2} shows a universal curve which varies linearly in H/H_{c2} for both Y-123 and Y-124.

The strong fluctuation effects are observed by the crossover of various 4\pi M(T) data due to the increasing fluctuational diamagnetism with regard to increasing applied fields. The magnetization data in high fields show good 3D scaling behavior in the variable [T-T_{c}(H)]/(TH)^{2/3}.

###### Abstract

Reversible-magnetization data have been studied for YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} in order to determine the thermodynamic properties and the magnetic-field dependence of the superfluid density. By fitting the Hao-Clem variational model to the reversible magnetization data below T_{c}, superconducting parameters such as the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa, the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}, and the superconducting order parameter are determined. The upper and lower critical fields H_{c2}, H_{c1}, the penetration depth \lambda, and the coherence length \xi are derived. Within the model there is a direct connection between the magnetization and the superfluid density, so the vortex structure, the behavior of the average order parameter in (H,T) plane, and the magnetic-field dependence of the superfluid density are obtained. In the high-field region, the evidence of strong vortex fluctuation effects is observed and explained by vortex fluctuation for a three-dimensional superconductor. The mean-field transition temperature T_{e}(H) and dH_{c2}/dT near T_{c} derived from the analysis of vortex fluctuation effects are comparable with fitting results.

## I Introduction

The Hao-Clem theory has proven to be remarkably successful in describing the thermodynamic properties of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Y-123). There are several different regimes of temperature and magnetic field with different models applicable. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory is the fundamental pioneering work for isotropic classical superconductors that applies in the limit that the superconducting order parameter is not too large near T_{c}.[1] In the GL theory, a complex pseudowave function \Psi is introduced as an order parameter for the superconducting electrons and the free energy is expressed as a function of the order parameter and magnetic field. Both of these two variational parameters are used to minimize the free energy. For the high-field region H_{c2}-H\ll H_{c2}, the Abrikosov solution[2] based on the GL equations is applicable by using the fact that |\Psi|^{2} is small near H_{c2} to solve the GL equations perturbatively, where |\Psi| is the amplitude of the order parameter. The Abrikosov result, however, gives a static array of vortices and hence is not applicable to the high-T_{c} superconductors[3] where flux line lattice melting, entangled vortex structures, vortex glass behavior, and strong fluctuation effects occur. For the intermediate field H_{c1}\ll H\ll H_{c2} which most experimental magnetization data fall into, the London model[1] provides the detailed phenomenological description for extreme type-II superconductors for which the GL parameter \kappa=\lambda/\xi satisfies \kappa\gg 1, where \lambda is the penetration depth and \xi is the coherence length. In the London model, both the magnetic flux density and the supercurrent density of an isolated vortex diverge on the axis of the vortex, because the vortex core is ignored, where the order parameter suppresses to zero. Recently, Hao and Clem[4, 5] developed a variational model that includes an energy term arising from suppression of the order parameter in the vortex core. They then solved the GL-like equation numerically in the intermediate region. Successful application[4, 6] of the Hao-Clem model to the experimental M(H) data allows the GL parameter \kappa and the critical field H_{c} to be determined as fitting parameters to a variational solution for an extreme type-II superconductor, where the GL parameter satisfies the condition \kappa\gg 1 in the reversible magnetization regime.

The YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} (Y-124) structure is closely related to the Y-123 structure, except with one additional Cu-O chain per unit cell, that is, Y-124 has two CuO_{2} planes and two CuO chains in the unit cell. This leads to a longer c-lattice parameter of 27.21 A. Y-124 is characterized by an excellent thermal stability of the oxygen content, while Y-123 is strongly sensitive to the oxygen concentration changes that occur as crystals are cooled in different partial pressures of oxygen.[7] Although Y-124 is a good candidate for applications, there has been an  ambiguity in experimental determinations of fundamental physical parameters, such as the GL parameter \kappa, critical fields, and penetration depth among published results.[8, 9]

In this paper, we applied the Hao-Clem model to the reversible magnetization data in order to determine the superconducting physical parameters. Because the data fit the model well, a rather detailed picture of the vortex structure and the magnetic-field dependence of the average order parameter for a given temperature can be derived. A universal curve when plotted on the average of the square of the order parameter vs the H/H_{c2} plot as predicted in theory[10] can be obtained. Finally, the analysis of strong vortex fluctuation was carried out at higher temperatures where fluctuation models apply.

## II Experiment

About a 10-g polycrystalline sample of Y-124 was synthesized from a stoichiometric mixture of oxide of Y and Cu, and barium carbonate in air at 900 ^{\circ}C. The sample was fired several times with frequent intermediate grindings until no trace of barium carbonate could be detected in the x-ray diffraction pattern. A subsequent high pressure synthesis was done three times for 12 h in 20% O_{2} in argon at a total pressure of 2 Kbar (600 atm O_{2} pressure) at 1050 ^{\circ}C followed by slow cooling (1.5 deg/min) to room temperature. A large capacity hot isostatic press system (inside diameter = 8 cm and height = 16 cm) was used for high oxygen pressure synthesis.

Grain-aligned powders of tiny single crystals were used instead of one single crystal in order to give a larger sample and a better signal-to-noise ratio. To make a grain-aligned sample in an epoxy matrix, the bulk pellets were ground to a powder of an average diameter 12-20 \mum and mixed thoroughly with a low viscosity and low magnetic susceptibility out-gassed epoxy (EPOTEK 301) in a Teflon container. The liquid slurry was placed in magnetic fields of 8.2 T for 15 h. A flat-plate sample was prepared for the x-ray diffraction studies to test whether the c axis of the grain-aligned sample is perpendicular to the surface of the plate. Cylindrical samples were made in the same container for magnetization measurements.

The x-ray diffraction patterns of \theta-2\theta scan for an aligned sample with the c axis perpendicular to the surface is shown in Fig. 1. The _(0,0,l)_ lines are very strongly enhanced by the alignment, and the other lines are suppressed into the noise level. To obtain a more quantitative measure of the mosaic spread of the grains, a pole figure experiment indicates that the full width of half maximum for the _(0,0,_14)_ peak, FWHM, is about 1.8^{\circ}. This value for the grain-aligned Y-124 is the same as the typical values for Y-123.

All the magnetization measurements were carried out in a magnetic field applied parallel to the c axis with use of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). A 3-cm scan length was used for the field homogeneity. Both the shielding and Meissner data for the aligned sample taken at a magnetic field of 5 Oe is shown in Fig. 2, with the onset transition temperature of 81.4 K. The correction for background was made by extrapolation of a linear fit to the normal state data between 100 and 250 K.

## III Results and Discussion

### Determination of superconducting parameters

The analysis presented here is based on a fit of M(H) data constructed from a series of M(T) data at various applied magnetic fields parallel to the c-axis in the reversible regime to the Hao-Clem model. Figure 3(a) shows the fitting results of the magnetization data for the various temperatures between 68 and 74 K. As the temperature approaches 74 K, the magnetization data show small deviations from the fitting line near the high-field range because the strong fluctuation effects become important in this range. The data have been fitted two ways, first by forcing \kappa to be the average \kappa value, 70, and then by allowing \kappa to be a free parameter. With \kappa forced to be 70, all the magnetization data of Fig. 3(a) collapse to a single curve shown in Fig. 3(b). If \kappa is allowed to be a free variable, one obtains the temperature dependent \kappa shown in Fig. 4 where \kappa varies from 69 to 72. If data above 74 K are used, \kappa begins to increase as expected for

  the onset of fluctuation effects.[6] The abrupt increase of \kappa near 74 K is thought to be the result of a fluctuation effect.

Another parameter determined from this fitting is the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(T), which is shown in Fig. 5. In the limited range from 68 to 74 K, the H_{c}(T) data are linear in temperature and give T_{c} = 81.8 K and dH_{c}/dT = -102.8 Oe/K. A fit of H_{c}(T) data to the BCS temperature dependent H_{c}(T) formula given by Clem,[11]H_{c}(T)/H_{c}(0) = 1.7367[1-T/T_{c}][1- 0.2730(1-T/T_{c}) - 0.0949(1-T/T_{c})^{2}], yields H_{c}(0) = (0.53 \pm 0.01)\times10^{4} Oe with T_{c} = 81.5 K. These values are to be compared with the superconducting onset temperature, 81.4 K, measured in low field (5 Oe) M vs T data shown in Fig. 2. Values of the upper critical field derived from H_{c2} = \kappa\sqrt{2}H_{c}(T) are shown in Fig. 6. From the linear extrapolation of H_{c2}, dH_{c2}/dT and T_{c} are -1.02 T/K and 81.8 K, respectively. The slope, dH_{c2}/dT, can be also

  obtained from the above equation with use of the average \kappa of 70, which yields dH_{c2}/dT = -1.018 T/K near T_{c}. These values are comparable with each other. Using the approach by Werthamer, Helland, and Hohenberg (WHH),[12]H_{c2}(0)\cong-0.7T_{c}(dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}}, which yields H_{c2}(0) = 58.1 T. The coherence length \xi can be obtained from the relation H_{c2}(0)=\phi_{0}/2\pi\xi^{2} (\phi_{0} is one flux quantum, 2.07\times10^{-7} G cm^{2}) to be 23.8 A. The penetration depth \lambda can be derived from the \kappa = \lambda/\xi to be 1666 A. To see the likely range of \lambda values it is helpful to use both clean and dirty limit relations. According to the BCS clean limit prediction[13] for \lambda(T), \lambda(T) = \lambda(0)/\sqrt{2(1-T/T_{c})} for T\longrightarrow T_{c}, we obtain \lambda(0) = 1879 A. Meanwhile, in the BCS dirty limit,[13]\lambda(T) = \lambda(0)/\sqrt{2.7(1-T/T_{c})} for T\longrightarrow T_{c}, which gives \lambda(0) = 2183 A. The value of \lambda(0) in the BCS clean limit may be in better agreement with the \lambda(0) value from \lambda = \kappa\xi relation. The lower critical field H_{c1}(0) can be derived from H_{c1} = (\phi_{0}/4\pi\lambda^{2})(ln\kappa + 0.5) to be 220 Oe.

### Vortex structure

Because the Hao-Clem model describes the data well, one can derive the values of the vortex core variables that are needed to give the measured magnetization. In the model, the order parameter is written in terms of the

\[f=f_{\infty}\frac{\rho}{(\rho^{2}+\xi_{v}^{2})^{1/2}}\ ,\] (1)

where \rho is the radial distance, f_{\infty} is the value of f at \rho = \infty and \xi_{v} governs the rise of f near the core. Once the values of H_{c} and \kappa are known, the variational parameters \xi_{v} and f_{\infty} can be determined for each value of  tions are cut at the midpoint between vortices, at a/2, and symmetrized for the nearest vortex position. Using these values, the order parameter functions derived for an array of vortices at T=71 K with the applied field H=1,3, and 5 T are shown in Fig. 7. The derivative of the order parameter is discontinuous at the boundary of the Wigner-Seitz-like cell of the vortex. To calculate average values of f and f^{2}, with the simplification that the unit cell of the vortex array may be approximated by a circular one, we introduce the average order parameter for a single vortex, defined as \langle f\rangle=(8/a^{2})\int_{0}^{a/2}f(\rho)\rho d\rho, where a is the vortex spacing. The three-dimensional surface plot of \langle f\rangle on the (H,T) plane is shown in Fig. 8. It shows the supression of the average order parameter by about 58% at 74 K and 5 T.

The density of electrons in the superconducting ground state (n_{s}) is proportional to \langle f^{2}\rangle, so we also have evaluated this quantity. Plotting the \langle f^{2}\rangle data on a reduced field plot of H/H_{c2} as in Fig. 9, it is clear that the data fall on a universal curve. Here H_{c2}=\kappa\sqrt{2}H_{c}(T) as derived from fitting the magnetization data. These data are very similar to Y-123 reported previously.[14]

Two conclusions can be drawn from Fig. 9. First, the \langle f^{2}\rangle vs H/H_{c2} curves for all temperature and field values fall on a universal curve. Second, this universal curve extrapolates linearly to H/H_{c2} as predicted by Brandt.[10]

### Fluctuation effect and high field scaling behavior of magnetization

Above 74 K, fluctuation effects become important. A remarkable aspect of the critical fluctuation in high fields is that magnetization is field independent at temperature T^{\star}. Bulaevskii _et al.[15]_ and Kogan _et al.[16]_ formulated a fluctuation theory in a layered superconductor within a Lowrence-Doniach framework, assuming H is perpendicular to the layers. In Fig. 10, all plots of 4\pi M vs T measured at fields between 1 T and 5 T cross at T^{\star}=79.2 K and 4\pi M^{\star}=-0.79 G. According to a formula, s=-4\pi k_{B}T^{\star} / (4\pi M^{\star}\phi_{0}) given by Bulaevskii _et al.[15]_ where 4\pi M^{\star} is in G and the cgs unit is used, the distance between CuO_{2} planes, s, can be estimated to be 8\times 10^{-7} cm (80 A). This value of s is larger than one (\sim 10.5 A) determined by the crystalline structure method. This disagreement may be caused by the application of the two-dimensional (2D) model to a 3D anisotropic superconductor (Y-124). The superconducting volume fraction may be another factor to affect a value of M^{\star} in the above formula. Also the fluctuational diamagnetism above the low-field onset T_{c} is observed.

The temperature and field dependence of magnetization in the transition region in high magnetic fields shows the scaling behavior given by 4\pi M/(TH)^{n}=F\{A[T-T_{c}(H)]/(TH)^{n}\}, where F is the scaling function, A is a temperature and field independent coefficient, and n is 2/3 for a 3D system and 1/2 for a 2D system. Welp _et al.[17]_ showed good 3D scaling behavior for the magnetization, electrical conductivity, Ettinghausen effect, and specific heat of Y-123 single crystals. The 2D scaling behavior was observed by Li _et al.[18, 19]_ in Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{1}0 and Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8} single crystals. With two adjustable parameters, T_{c0} and dH_{c2}/dT near T_{c}, the result of fitting is shown in Fig. 11, where 3D scaling of these magnetization data is displayed. The best fit for 3D behavior yields T_{c0}\cong 83.0\pm 0.1 K and dH_{c2}/dT\cong-1.9\pm 0.2 T/K. Less than a 10% change of dH_{c2}/dT affects a little for the best fit. The 2D scaling behavior of magnetization with any choice of T_{c0} and dH_{c2}/dT shows somewhat poor.

## IV Conclusions

The reversible magnetization of grain-aligned Y-124 has been studied with the applied fields along the c direction. A successful fitting of the Hao-Clem model to experimental M(H) data gives the results that the GL parameter \kappa is slightly decreasing up to 72 K, with the value 70 at 71 K, and starts to increase at temperature 73 K. Finally, \kappa diverges in the vicinity of T_{c}. The strong fluctuation effects cause this unusual temperature dependence of \kappa(T) near T_{c}. With the \kappa value, 70, which

  is determined by fitting the data, the derived superconducting parameters are H_{c}(0)=5225 Oe, \xi_{ab}(0)=23.8 A, \lambda_{ab}(0)=1880 A in clean limit, H_{c1}(0)=220 Oe, H_{c2}(0)=58 T, and dH_{c2}/dT=-1.02 T/K near T_{c}.

The spatial average of the order parameter and the square of the order parameter, which uses the Hao-Clem order parameter function, is in good agreement with Brandt's rather well. The plot on \langle f^{2}\rangle vs H/H_{c2} shows a universal curve which varies linearly in H/H_{c2} for both Y-123 and Y-124.

The strong fluctuation effects are observed by the crossover of various 4\pi M(T) data due to the increasing fluctuational diamagnetism with regard to increasing applied fields. The magnetization data in high fields show good 3D scaling behavior in the variable [T-T_{c}(H)]/(TH)^{2/3}.
