 of zirconium trigonal antiprismatic sites in the Zr_{5}Sb_{3} host.[8] Band structural calculations have shown that the zirconium states and electrons are diverted from the broad conduction band to form the Zr-Z bonds.[8]

Polycrystalline samples of Zr_{5}_X__{3} (X = Sb, Al, Ga, Ge, and Sn) were synthesized through the arc-melting method. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the x-ray Rietveld refinement patterns of Zr_{5}Sb_{3} and Zr_{5}Sn_{3}, respectively. The sharp peaks and good refinement values of Rp and Rwp (Rp = 4.60%, Rwp = 7.11% for Zr_{5}Sb_{3} and Rp = 5.38%, Rwp = 7.58% for Zr_{5}Sn_{3}) demonstrate that they possess the hexagonal Mn_{5}Si_{3} structure type. The refined lattice parameters are a = 8.4053(3) A and c = 5.7640(3) A for Zr_{5}Sb_{3}, a = 8.4606(3) A and c = 5.771(2) A for Zr_{5}Sn_{3}, and match well with previous studies.[70] A few minor peaks are also found in the x-ray powder patterns of Zr_{5}Sb_{3} [marked by red stars in Fig. 2(a)], estimated to be less than 5% of the major peaks intensity and possibly due to the orthorhombic Y_{5}Bi_{3}-type Zr_{5}Sb_{3}. The metallic gray ingots after arc melting are moderately stable for a few hours in humid air before turning into black powder.

The superconductivity in Zr_{5}Sb_{3} is evident from the magnetic susceptibility \chi(T), electrical resistivity \rho(T,H), and the specific-heat C_{p}(T) measurements. Figure 3 displays the \chi(T) measured at 5 Oe both in the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) modes. A clear diamagnetic shift is observed below 2.3 K. The shielding volume fraction from ZFC-\chi(T) is \sim1.3 before demagnetization correction, in conjunction with the FC-\chi(T), indicating bulk superconductivity for the sample. The M(H) curve at 1.9 K in the inset shows clear type-II superconductor characteristics, with a low critical field \dot{H}_{c1}<5 Oe.

The electrical resistivity \rho(T) of Zr_{5}Sb_{3} is shown in Fig. 4, with a room-temperature value of 0.36 m\Omega cm. It decreases with decreasing temperature, typical for a metal, and drops sharply below 2.3 K, characteristic of a superconducting transition. The transition width is estimated to be 0.2 K from 10 to 90% resistivity drops. In the presence of magnetic fields, the superconducting transition is systematically shifted to lower temperature and suppressed to below 1.9 K at 7 kOe, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4.

The bulk superconductivity of the compound is further demonstrated by the pronounced specific-heat C_{p} anomaly, as shown in Fig. 5. The superconducting transition is suppressed to below 0.4 K in a magnetic field of 30 kOe (Fig. 5). The electronic Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma and Debye temperature \theta_{D} are 24.1 mJ/(mol K^{2}) and \sim240 K, respectively. The electronic contribution to the heat capacity C_{el} in the

  superconducting state is determined by subtracting the 30-kOe data. The normalized C_{el}/(\gammaT) as a function of the reduced temperature, T/T_{c}, is plotted in the inset of Fig. 5 and compared with the theory. The BCS theory (dashed line) does not fit the data well; however, the modification of the superconducting gap, as described by the \alpha-model,[11] leads to a good description of the experimental data. In magnetic fields, the heat capacity peak is shifted to lower temperature, as expected for the superconducting state. Data in different external fields are shown in Fig. 6. The upper critical field H_{c2}(T) is derived from the heat capacity data and shown in the inset of Fig. 6. The extrapolation of H_{c2} to zero temperature is done by fitting the data to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory,[12] shown as the red line in the figure. H_{c2}(0) is indeed found to be less than 30 kOe, as already suggested by the heat capacity data of Fig. 6. Unfortunately, the isostructural Zr_{5}Sn_{3} was found not to be superconducting. Its C_{p} reveals a much smaller Sommerfeld coefficient = 14 mJ/(mol K^{2}) and Debye temperature \theta_{D} = \sim280 K. Since \gamma in normal metals is proportional to the electronic DOS at the Fermi level E_{F}, a 40% lower value may explain the missing superconducting state in Zr_{5}Sn_{3}.

The band structures and the DOS at the Fermi level of both Zr_{5}Sb_{3} and Zr_{5}Sn_{3} have been calculated. Zr_{5}Sb_{3} has bands at the Fermi level that are much more strongly coupled to phonons than in Zr_{5}Sn_{3}, indicating Zr_{5}Sb_{3} has a much stronger electron-phonon coupling than Zr_{5}Sn_{3}.[13] The DOS of Zr_{5}Sb_{3} at the Fermi level is about 2.4 times higher than that of Zr_{5}Sn_{3}, as shown in Fig. 7, in good agreement with the results of the C_{p} experiments. Therefore, the observed superconductivity in Zr_{5}Sb_{3} is possibly of the BCS type arising from decent electron-phonon interaction as well as its high DOS at the F_{F} due to the d electrons of Zr.

  Both hexagonal Mn_{5}Si_{3}-type (P6_{3}/mcm) and orthorhombic Y_{5}Bi_{3}-type (Pnma) structures exist for the Zr_{5}Sb_{3} compound. The former appears nonstoichiometric as Zr_{5}Sb_{3+x} with 0\leqslant x\leqslant 0.4, while the latter forms stoichiometrically but only stable at high temperature above 1200 ^{\circ}C.[7] To further investigate how the nonstoichiometry affects the superconducting properties, samples with nominal compositions of Zr_{5}Sb_{3} and Zr_{5}Sb_{3,3} have been made through solid-state sintering process. Different stoichiometric materials were mixed thoroughly and pressed into a pellet inside a glove box. The pellets were initially sealed in a Nb tube under Ar, subsequently sealed in the quartz jacket under vacuum, and then heated up very slowly to 1000 ^{\circ}C for 5 d. The lattice parameter increases for Zr_{5}Sb_{3,3} [a=b=8.577(2) A and c=5.874(2) A], as compared to those of Zr_{5}Sb_{3}, clearly show the difference of the Sb content and are consistent with previous studies.[7] As illustrated in Fig. 8(a), both the onset T_{c} and shielding fraction decrease in the Zr_{5}Sb_{3,3} sample. As previous studies indicated, the extra Sb in Zr_{5}Sb_{3+x} occupies the octahedral interstitial sites formed by the Zr trigonal antiprism,[7] and our results show that superconductivity in Zr_{5}Sb_{3} is suppressed when the interstitial sites are filled by Sb atoms. We have further tested the influence of Z= O and C, which are introduced to Zr_{5}Sb_{3} through arc-melting and sintering processes. The Zr_{5}Sb_{3}O and Zr_{5}Sb_{3}C were made through sintering and the arc-melting process according to Ref. 8 by nominal composition. The Zr_{5}Sb_{3}O_{x} was made though the arc-melting process with reduced O_{2} atmosphere (2.5% O_{2} balanced with argon), although the exact O content is yet to be determined. Only a small diamagnetic signal below 2 K was detected in Zr_{5}Sb_{3}O_{x}, and no superconductivity was observed in Zr_{5}Sb_{3}O and Zr_{5}Sb_{3}C samples [Fig. 8(a)], further proving that superconductivity is not favored by interstitial-filled compounds of Zr_{5}Sb_{3}. This is also consistent with previous theoretical calculations that the formation of the Zr-Z bond significantly reduces the Zr1-Zr1 bonding from the trigonal antiprism construction and thus might reduce the DOS at the Fermi surface and suppress the superconducting signal.

Chemical doping with different species has also been carried out. Ti doping by 5% has effectively suppressed the superconducting transition from 2.3 K down to 2 K [Fig. 8(b)], and there is no superconducting signal observed in the 10% Ti-doped sample. This demonstrates that the Ti has been doped into the structure. However, the superconductivity seems pretty robust and stays at \sim2.3 K with 5% of either Hf or Y doping [Fig. 8(b)]. Chemical analysis from scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive x-ray (SEM-EDX) clearly shows the homogeneous distribution of Hf, Y, and Ti within the grains of the samples. Therefore, the effects of Y, Hf, and Ti substitution on the superconductivity of Zr_{5}Sb_{3} are rather different.

In summary, we have carried out magnetization, electrical resistivity, and specific heat measurements, and band structure calculations on Zr_{5}Sb_{3} and Zr_{5}Sn_{3}. The results show bulk superconductivity with a T_{c}\sim 2.3 K in Zr_{5}Sb_{3}, representing the first superconductor discovered in the large family of Mn_{5}Si_{3} structure type. No superconductivity above 2 K was detected in Zr_{5}Sn_{3}, attributable to its low DOS at the Fermi level and absence of strongly phonon-coupled bands around the Fermi energy given by the band structure calculations. Detailed doping studies have shown that superconductivity in Zr_{5}Sb_{3} is rather robust with Hf and Y substitution of Zr, but suppressed by Ti substitution; it is also suppressed by interstitial filling in Zr_{5}Sb_{3}Z by Z= Sb, C, or O. In view of the large number of compounds in the Mn_{5}Si_{3} structure family, more superconductors, with some of higher T_{c}, are expected. An extensive search for superconductivity in this and related compound families is underway.
