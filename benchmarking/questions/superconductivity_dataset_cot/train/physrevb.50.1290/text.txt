###### Abstract

The line shape and Knight shift of the 89Y NMR resonance was obtained for fully oxygenated (_x_ = 7), oxygen deficient (_x_ = 6.7), and nonsuperconducting oxygen deficient (_x_ = 6) fluorine-doped YBCO (Yba2Cu3OxFy). The results show that while fluorine can increase the onset superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) in oxygen deficient material, the Knight shift is practically independent of the fluorine concentration. The consequences of this result as far as \(T_{c}\) is concerned are discussed.

## I Introduction

Fluorine has been inserted into the high-temperature superconducting compounds YBa2Cu3O_x_ in order to modify the valence of the copper and study the resulting superconducting transition properties.1-5 It was found that fluorine may have a restorative effect on the onset transition temperature. Thus an oxygen-deficient material YBa2Cu3O6,7 having an onset \(T_{c}\) of 63 K, increases its \(T_{c}\) progressively upon fluorination to its final value of 91 K at a concentration of \(y\) = 0.2 (YBa2Cu3OxFy). Increasing the fluorine content beyond this concentration decreases the superconducting diamagnetic signal without further increasing \(T_{c}\). Fluorination of a fully oxygenated material does not increase its \(T_{c}\) beyond 91 K, but has its diamagnetic signal decreased. This reduction is attributed to intergranular effects.3,6 Neutron-diffraction studies performed on YBa2Cu3O6,Fy indicate that at first the fluorine enters mostly the vacant chain oxygen sites, and then also the sites between the chain Cu along the \(a\) axis.2,5

The nuclear magnetic resonance of 89Y is a convenient tool for probing changes in the electronic structure of these materials.7-9 This is because 89Y has a nuclear spin of 12 and is thus free from complications due to quadrupole interactions. It has been found7,8 that the 89Y Knight shift steadily increases from negative to positive values as oxygen is removed and \(T_{c}\) decreases. Similarly, when the fully oxygenated material is doped with hydrogen, the Knight shift follows the same curve, i.e., the Knight shift becomes less negative with the introduction of hydrogen.9 Also, the onset \(T_{c}\) remains constant until a concentration is reached where the material becomes a nonsuperconductor and the Cu(2) atoms in the plane align antiferromagnetically. Thus the Knight shift, which is a measure of the density of states at the Fermi level, is useful for following the electronic changes brought about by doping. We therefore used this method for investigating the effect of F doping on samples having three different values of the oxygen content, covering the fully oxygenated YBa2Cu3O7 superconducting \(T_{c}\)  91 K material, the partially oxygenated YBa2Cu3O6,7 superconducting \(T_{c}\)  63 K material, and the nonsuperconductor YBa2Cu3O6.

## II Experimental technique

The three starting oxides YBa2Cu3O_x_ (_x_ = 6, 6.7, and 7) were prepared by solid-state reaction starting from the oxides and carbonates, following a procedure described in Ref. [3]. These samples were then fluorinated by flowing diluted NF3 gas (3% in N2) at a temperature of about 300degC for various reaction times.3 The fluorine content was determined from the weight increase, the quality from x-ray diffraction, and \(T_{c}\) was determined by the mutual induction technique. The 89Y resonance was measured at room temperature at a resonance frequency of 14.707 MHz using standard techniques described elsewhere.9 Each spectrum represents an average of about 6000 echoes in the time domain, with a repetition time of 20 sec. This is of the order of the spin-lattice relaxation time \(T\)1 for the superconducting material, and about half that value for the nonsuperconductor.10 Hence if there are nuclei in different environments having different \(T\)1's, the amplitudes of different spectral components may not fully reflect the absolute intensities, and the spectrum may be somewhat distorted.

## III Experimental results

We obtained the Knight shift, linewidth, and line shape of the 89Y resonance in YBa2Cu3O7Fy where \(y\) = 0, 0.10, and 0.20; in YBa2Cu3O6,7Fy, where \(y\) = 0, 0.10, 0.15, 0.25, 0.29, and 0.38; and in YBa2Cu3O6Fy, where \(y\) = 0, 0.60, 0.98, and 1.50. The results of the measurements and the onset \(T_{c}\) of these samples (as obtained from the induction measurements) are summarized in Table I. The Knight shift was measured relative to 89Y in an aqueous solution of YCl3. The onset \(T_{c}\) of the last entry in the table (YBa2Cu3O6F1.5) was not measured since its value was less than 54 K, the lower limit of the temperature range of our measurements. However, it was seen that the sample contains some superconducting volume at 4 K. A previous sample having the same composition had an onset \(T_{c}\) of 50 K.3 The accuracy of the \(K\) shift and linewidth of the nonsuperconducting samples was much more difficult to determine, since the lines are considerably wider due to the antiferromagnetic interaction.

The linewidth of 89Y in undoped YBa2Cu3O_x_ is of the order of 1 kHz for \(x\) in the superconducting range, and jumps by a factor of about 4 when \(x\) is such as to make it a nonsuperconductor.7 This is because of the local magnetic field caused by the antiferromagnetic alignment. For our samples, adding fluorine has no noticeable effect on the line shape, provided the material remains a superconductor. This is illustrated in Fig. 1, where the spectra of 89Y in YBa2Cu3O6, and YBa2Cu3O6,F0.25 are compared. The nonsuperconducting material gives a much larger linewidth. It is interesting to note that when a fluorine concentration of \(y=\)1.5 is added to YBa2Cu3O6, superconductive behavior is restored. This is also reflected in the 89Y line shape (Fig. 2), where a narrow line is seen to be superimposed on the wide line of the nonsuperconducting material. This shows that the YBa2Cu3O6F1.5 must be a mixture of a superconducting and nonsuperconducting phases. When the 89Y line shape of the nonsuperconducting phase (YBa2Cu3O6F0.6) is subtracted, only the narrow line of the superconducting phase remains.

## IV Discussion

When oxygen is added to oxygen-deficient YBa2Cu3O_x_, the onset \(T_{c}\) increases, and is restored to its value of 92 K when \(x\) reaches 7. At the same time the 89Y Knight shift decreases to more negative values with increasing \(x\).7 reflecting the increase of the hole concentration in the material. It was seen that adding F to oxygen-deficient YBaCu2O_x_ also has a \(T_{c}\) restoring effect on the material.

Figure 1: Comparison of the 89Y NMR line shape for fluorine-free (YBa2Cu3O6,) and fluorine-doped (YBa2Cu3O6,F0.25) YBCO showing that doping with F in the superconducting material has no effect on the line shape.

Figure 2: Comparison of the 89Y line shape for nonsuperconducting YBa2Cu3O6,F0.6 with that for YBa2Cu3O6,F1.5, which has its high-\(T_{c}\) superconducting property partially restored. The line of the F free material is wide due to the antiferromagnetic interaction. The F-doped material shows a narrower line superimposed on the wide line. This is emphasized in the middle trace, which is obtained by taking the difference between the top and bottom spectra. The wide line cancels, leaving only the narrow component. The narrow component is attributed to the existence of nonantiferromagnetic superconducting material.

  If the hole concentration were the only underlying criterion determining \(T_{c}\), then this should be reflected in the change in the Knight shift in a manner similar to that of adding oxygen. Such a change in the Knight shift was obtained in the case of hydrogen addition, where the addition of two hydrogens was equivalent to the removal of one oxygen.[9] Since F has a valency of unity, one might expect that adding two F's, may shift the Knight shift by the same amount as adding one oxygen. Figure 3 is a plot of the Knight shift as a function of \(x+y/2\), where \(x\) is the oxygen concentration per unit cell and \(y\) is the fluorine concentration. The broken curve is the "9Y \(K\) shift for the fluorine-free material. It is a smooth curve of a locally weighted regression through the experimental points obtained by Alloul _et al._[7] and Balakrishnan _et al._[8] One can see that (a) the Knight shift of the fluorine-free samples obtained in this study agrees with those of Alloul _et al._ and Balakrishnan _et al._; and (b) rather than following the changes obtained by oxygen addition, F doping has very little if any effect on the Knight shift.

The fact that doping YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{6.7}\) with F can raise \(T_{c}\) and restore superconductivity in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{6}\) without changing the Knight shift can be taken as evidence that the carrier concentration is not the sole factor in determining \(T_{c}\). This can also be seen from the behavior of \(T_{c}\) as a function of oxygen concentration. While the Knight shift changes steadily with oxygen concentration, \(T_{c}\) exhibits a steplike change in that there are two plateaus above and below \(x=6.5\).[11] This has been attributed to an ordering of the chain oxygen into alternating full and empty chains.[12] Thus the local crystallographic environment is an important factor in the behavior of \(T_{c}\). A similar effect was seen upon hydrogen doping. Although the Knight shift steadily changes as a function of H concentration,[9] the onset \(T_{c}\) remains constant at 92 K, until a hydrogen concentration is reached where antiferromagnetic order takes over[13, 14] and the material becomes a nonsuperconductor.

Figure 3: The Knight shift of \({}^{89}\)Y in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{x}\)F\({}_{y}\) as a function of \(x+y/2\). The broken line gives the shift as a function of oxygen concentration for the fluorine-free material, and is taken from the results of Alloul _et al._ and Balakrishnan _et al._ (Refs. [7] and [8]). It can be seen that F doping has very little (if any) effect on the \(K\) shift. Had fluorine contributed holes to the conduction band, the \(K\) shift points should have been on the broken line.
