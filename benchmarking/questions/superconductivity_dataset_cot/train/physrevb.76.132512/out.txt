###### Abstract

We have performed ultrahigh-resolution photoemission spectroscopy on noncentrosymmetric superconductor La_{2}C_{3} to study the electronic structure near the Fermi level (E_{F}) and the superconducting-gap symmetry. We clearly observed the opening of the superconducting gap, as evidenced by the emergence of a sharp quasiparticle peak just below E_{F} together with the leading-edge shift toward higher binding energy. Quantitative analysis of the gap function has revealed a marked deviation from the single s- or d-wave symmetry, suggesting the existence of multiple superconducting gaps.

The discovery of superconductivity in a noncentrosymmetric heavy-fermion compound CePt_{3}Si has provoked much attention on the electronic structure and its relation to the mechanism of superconductivity.[1] In particular, a hot debate has arisen on the pairing symmetry of this class of superconductors that lack the inversion symmetry in the crystal structure.[2] It is well known that the spin degeneracy of energy bands is lifted in a noncentrosymmetric crystal due to the antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling, and the broken space-inversion symmetry would violate the standard classification of Cooper pairs in terms of even or odd parity (spin singlet or triplet), leading to a peculiar pairing state where the spin singlet and triplet states are indistinguishably mixed.[2] The spin-lattice relaxation rate of CePt_{3}Si shows a coherence peak suggestive of the isotropic energy gap, while it shows a distinct deviation from the power-law behavior at low temperatures, indicating the presence of a line node.[3] The magnetic penetration depth[4] and the thermodynamic transport measurements[5] are in favor of the latter case. Although both Li_{2}Pd_{3}B and Li_{2}Pt_{3}B are noncentrosymmetric superconductors with the identical crystal structure,[6, 7] the multiple-[8] or s-wave-gap symmetry[9] has been proposed for Li_{2}Pd_{3}B, while the anisotropic-gap symmetry with a line node[8] has been suggested for Li_{2}Pt_{3}B. It is, thus, not well understood even experimentally whether the noncentrosymmetric superconductor possess a common unusual pairing symmetry, and if it is the case, what type of superconducting-gap symmetry it has.

Recently, the superconductivity has been discovered also in metallic carbides R_{2}C_{3} (R=Y and La),[10, 11] which crystallize in the cubic Pu_{2}C_{3}-type structure with no inversion center. This compound could serve as an ideal candidate to investigate the pairing symmetry of noncentrosymmetric superconductors without the influence from the strong electron correlation and/or the magnetic fluctuation. Unconventional superconductivity such as the multiband superconductivity[12, 13] or the mixture of s- and p-wave symmetries[2] would be regarded as a possible superconducting order parameter. However, the validity of these models as well as the possibility of other pairing channels have not been well examined yet, mainly because of the lack of ex- and the electronic structure near the Fermi level (E_{F}), in particular, on the low-energy excitations relevant to superconductivity.

In this Brief Report, we report results of ultrahigh-resolution photoemission spectroscopy on noncentrosymmetric La_{2}C_{3} single crystal. By using the ultrahigh resolution (\Delta E=1.7 meV), we have observed the opening of the superconducting gap at low temperatures. We found that the spectral line shape showing the superconducting gap is substantially deviated from that of the simple single-component s- or d-wave symmetry, but is reasonably explained by the presence of two-component energy gaps with significantly different coupling parameters.

High-quality single crystals of L_{2}C_{3} were grown by the self-flux method. The sharp x-ray diffraction pattern shows the high quality without inclusion from other phases, and the magnetization measurement has confirmed the occurrence of superconductivity with the superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) of 6.5 K. Ultrahigh-resolution photoemission measurements were performed using a Scienta SES2002 spectrometer with a high-flux discharge lamp and a toroidal grating monochromator at Tohoku University. The He i\alpha (h_w_ = 21.218 eV) and He ii\alpha (40.814 eV) resonance lines were used to excite photoelectrons. The energy resolution (\Delta E) was set at 1.7 meV, except for the measurement of the wide valence-band region (\Delta E=4 meV). Crystals were fractured _in situ_ in an ultrahigh vacuum of 2\times10^{-11} Torr to obtain a clean surface for the measurements. We have confirmed that the degradation of sample surface did not take place during the measurements, and the data shown here are reproducible by measuring several different samples. We have also confirmed that the obtained photo emission spectroscopy (PES) spectra show no discernible angular dependence, indicating that the PES spectra are well angle integrated. The Fermi level (E_{F}) of samples was referred to that of a gold film evaporated onto the sample substrate.

Figure 1 shows the valence-band photoemission spectra of La_{2}C_{3} measured at 4.5 K with the He i\alpha and He ii\alpha resonance lines. We find three prominent peaks located at 1, 4, and 7 eV, respectively, in both He i and He ii spectra, while the relative intensity of these peaks are slightly different between the He i and He ii spectra, possibly due to the cross-section effect. We also find that the He ii spectrum shows an

 additional large doublet structure around 19 eV. This doublet structure is not seen in the He i spectrum because of the lower excitation energy in the He i measurement. We also show in Fig. 1 the electron density of states (DOS) of Y_{2}C_{3} calculated by the scalar relativistic self-consistent full-potential linear muffin-tin method within the local density approximation (LDA).[14] Since the calculation for La_{2}C_{3} is not available at present, we compare the present photoemission result with the calculation for Y_{2}C_{3} by taking account of the possible difference between the 4d (Y) and 5d (La) states. As seen in Fig. 1, the DOS calculated for Y_{2}C_{3} tracks well the energy position of experimentally obtained valence bands of La_{2}C_{3}, suggesting that the valence band consists of essentially the C 2p states and/or the difference between the Y 4d and La 5d states is just a small contribution to the valence band. According to the calculation,[14] the bunch of calculated DOS located at E_{F} and 4 eV is mainly due to the hybridized states of the Y 4d and C 2p orbitals, while the prominent DOS around 7 eV originates mainly from the C 2s orbital hybridized with Y 4d states. The sharp calculated DOS around 14 eV is mainly due to the C 2s states. It is noted here that another LDA calculation by Singh and Mazin[15] reported a similar result, with a small quantitative difference in the width and the position of the bands. We therefore assign the two bands in La_{2}C_{3} observed by photoemission at 1 and 4 eV to the La 5d and C 2p hybridized states, and the small peak at 7 eV to the La 5d and C 2s hybridized states. The broad shoulderlike structure around 15 eV in the experiment may correspond to the DOS at 14 eV in the calculation, although the weight is considerably small in the experiment. A large doublet structure around 19 eV in the He ii spectrum is assigned to the spin-split La 5p core level.[16] It is noted that the band calculation of Y_{2}C_{3} does not show such a doublet structure simply because the calculation does not include the Y 4p states.

Figure 2 shows ultrahigh-resolution photoemission spectra in the vicinity of E_{F} of La_{2}C_{3} measured with the He i\alpha resonance line at temperatures (4.5 and 15 K) below and/or above the T_{c} (6.5 K). The spectral intensity is normalized to the area under the curve. As seen in Fig. 2, the spectrum clearly shows a remarkable temperature dependence that is not accounted for by the simple temperature effect due to the Fermi-Dirac (FD) distribution function. The midpoint of the leading edge in the spectrum at 4.5 K is not at E_{F}, but is shifted by about 0.6 meV toward the high binding energy with respect to E_{F} (see the inset of Fig. 2). In contrast, the spectrum at 15 K has the leading-edge midpoint at E_{F}. It is remarked that the 4.5-K spectrum exhibits a small but distinct quasiparticle peak at about 2 meV, while it totally disappears in the 15-K spectrum. This temperature-induced spectral change certainly indicates the opening and/or closing of a superconducting gap as a function of temperature in La_{2}C_{3}. A closer look at Fig. 2 further reveals an anomalous feature of the quasiparticle peak, which is apparently broad and rounded in comparison with the sharp quasiparticle peak observed by ultrahigh-resolution photoemission in conventional superconductors such as Nb (Ref. [17]) and V_{3}Si.[18] The broad and rounded feature of the quasiparticle peak of La_{2}C_{3} is hardly accounted for with a single peak, suggesting that the quasiparticle peak consists of two components (peaks), indicated by arrows in Fig. 2. This behavior is obviously different from the conventional superconductors which well follow the weak-coupling BCS spectral function with a single gap, but rather shows a close resemblance to the spectral behavior of the two-gap superconductor MgB_{2}.[19, 20]

In order to examine the conjecture described above as well as to reveal the symmetry and the size of the superconducting gap(s), we have performed numerical fittings to the photoemission spectrum and shown the results in Fig. 3. At first, we examined the single-gap scenario by using the single _s_-wave or _d_-wave Dynes function N(\omega,\Delta,\Gamma) with the parameters of \omega, \Delta, and \Gamma, where \omega, \Delta, and \Gamma are the energy relative to E_{F}, the size of the superconducting gap, and the phenomenological broadening factor, respectively.[21] In the case of _d_-wave gap, we assumed a cylindrical Fermi surface. The Dynes function for each gap symmetry is multiplied by the FD function at 4.5 K, and then convoluted with a Gauss

  ian with a full width at half maximum of 1.7 meV to incorporate the instrumental resolution. Although we have tried many fittings within a reasonable parameter space of the gap size and the broadening factor, the experimental spectrum at 4.5 K is hardly reproduced in both cases as shown in Fig. 3(a), where we see that the quasiparticle-peak position and the leading edge are not well reproduced simultaneously within the single-gap scheme. These results suggest that the gap function beyond the single s- or d-wave symmetry should be taken into account to explain the anomalous superconducting gap of La_{2}C_{3}. As an alternative candidate of the gap function, we assumed the presence of two isotropic s-wave gaps, whose gap function is described as \alpha N(\omega,\Delta_{S},\Gamma_{S})+(1-\alpha)N(\omega,\Delta_{L},\Gamma_{ L}), where \alpha is the ratio between the two gaps, and S and L denote small and large gaps, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the fitting curve with a small gap of \Delta_{S}=0.5 meV and a large gap of \Delta_{L}=1.7 meV at \alpha=0.7 reproduces the photoemission spectrum very well, both in the shape of the quasiparticle peak and the position and/or slope of the leading edge. By assuming the BCS-like temperature dependence, we have estimated the gap size at 0 K to be 0.6 and 2.1 meV for the small gap and the large gap, respectively, which correspond to 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=2.1 and 7.2. This indicates that the large gap has the coupling constant in the strong-coupling regime, while that of the small gap is well below the weak-coupling BCS value (3.53). It is worthwhile to note that the well-established two-gap superconductor MgB_{2} also shows the coexistence of the strong- and weak-coupling gaps with 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}=4 and 1.[19, 20] A recent ^{13}C NMR experiment on Y_{2}C_{3} reported a characteristic kink of 1/T_{1}T around 3 K, greatly below T_{c} (15.7 K),[13] which is well explained by the presence of two gaps with 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}=5 and 2, consistent with the present photoemission result. The existence of a line mode due to the singlet-triplet mixing and/or the anisotropic s-wave gap may be unlikely in La_{2}C_{3}, because the fairly small broadening factor observed for the small gap (\Gamma_{S}=0.03 meV) suggests the nearly isotropic nature of the s-wave gap. All these experimental results support the existence of two superconducting gaps with the s-wave symmetry. Recently, the two-band effect on the superconductivity has been theoretically discussed for Th-doped Y_{2}C_{3} and La_{2}C_{3}.[12] The theory predicts that although the spin-orbit coupling lifts the spin degeneracy of bands in most of the Brillouin zone, the spin-split Fermi surfaces touch each other along certain directions in the Brillouin zone due to the high crystallographic symmetry, producing the multiband effects in the superconducting state, where the superconducting gap would have multiple components. In order to examine the proposed two-band effect and reveal the origin of the anomalous superconductivity in La_{2}C_{3}, it is strongly desired to perform angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to directly observe the momentum dependence of the superconducting gaps.

In summary, we have reported ultrahigh-resolution photoemission spectroscopy on noncentrosymmetric superconductor La_{2}C_{3}. The photoemission spectrum at the superconducting state clearly shows a quasiparticle peak just below E_{F}, indicative of the superconducting-gap opening. The quasiparticle peak is broad and rounded compared to that of conventional superconductors. The numerical fittings have revealed that the spectrum is hardly reproduced with a single s- or d-wave gap, but is satisfactorily explained by two gaps with the gap values of 0.5 and 1.7 meV, respectively. All these experimental results suggest that La_{2}C_{3} is a two-gap superconductor.

The discovery of superconductivity in a noncentrosymmetric heavy-fermion compound CePt_{3}Si has provoked much attention on the electronic structure and its relation to the mechanism of superconductivity.[1] In particular, a hot debate has arisen on the pairing symmetry of this class of superconductors that lack the inversion symmetry in the crystal structure.[2] It is well known that the spin degeneracy of energy bands is lifted in a noncentrosymmetric crystal due to the antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling, and the broken space-inversion symmetry would violate the standard classification of Cooper pairs in terms of even or odd parity (spin singlet or triplet), leading to a peculiar pairing state where the spin singlet and triplet states are indistinguishably mixed.[2] The spin-lattice relaxation rate of CePt_{3}Si shows a coherence peak suggestive of the isotropic energy gap, while it shows a distinct deviation from the power-law behavior at low temperatures, indicating the presence of a line node.[3] The magnetic penetration depth[4] and the thermodynamic transport measurements[5] are in favor of the latter case. Although both Li_{2}Pd_{3}B and Li_{2}Pt_{3}B are noncentrosymmetric superconductors with the identical crystal structure,[6, 7] the multiple-[8] or s-wave-gap symmetry[9] has been proposed for Li_{2}Pd_{3}B, while the anisotropic-gap symmetry with a line node[8] has been suggested for Li_{2}Pt_{3}B. It is, thus, not well understood even experimentally whether the noncentrosymmetric superconductor possess a common unusual pairing symmetry, and if it is the case, what type of superconducting-gap symmetry it has.

Recently, the superconductivity has been discovered also in metallic carbides R_{2}C_{3} (R=Y and La),[10, 11] which crystallize in the cubic Pu_{2}C_{3}-type structure with no inversion center. This compound could serve as an ideal candidate to investigate the pairing symmetry of noncentrosymmetric superconductors without the influence from the strong electron correlation and/or the magnetic fluctuation. Unconventional superconductivity such as the multiband superconductivity[12, 13] or the mixture of s- and p-wave symmetries[2] would be regarded as a possible superconducting order parameter. However, the validity of these models as well as the possibility of other pairing channels have not been well examined yet, mainly because of the lack of ex- and the electronic structure near the Fermi level (E_{F}), in particular, on the low-energy excitations relevant to superconductivity.

In this Brief Report, we report results of ultrahigh-resolution photoemission spectroscopy on noncentrosymmetric La_{2}C_{3} single crystal. By using the ultrahigh resolution (\Delta E=1.7 meV), we have observed the opening of the superconducting gap at low temperatures. We found that the spectral line shape showing the superconducting gap is substantially deviated from that of the simple single-component s- or d-wave symmetry, but is reasonably explained by the presence of two-component energy gaps with significantly different coupling parameters.

High-quality single crystals of L_{2}C_{3} were grown by the self-flux method. The sharp x-ray diffraction pattern shows the high quality without inclusion from other phases, and the magnetization measurement has confirmed the occurrence of superconductivity with the superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) of 6.5 K. Ultrahigh-resolution photoemission measurements were performed using a Scienta SES2002 spectrometer with a high-flux discharge lamp and a toroidal grating monochromator at Tohoku University. The He i\alpha (h_w_ = 21.218 eV) and He ii\alpha (40.814 eV) resonance lines were used to excite photoelectrons. The energy resolution (\Delta E) was set at 1.7 meV, except for the measurement of the wide valence-band region (\Delta E=4 meV). Crystals were fractured _in situ_ in an ultrahigh vacuum of 2\times10^{-11} Torr to obtain a clean surface for the measurements. We have confirmed that the degradation of sample surface did not take place during the measurements, and the data shown here are reproducible by measuring several different samples. We have also confirmed that the obtained photo emission spectroscopy (PES) spectra show no discernible angular dependence, indicating that the PES spectra are well angle integrated. The Fermi level (E_{F}) of samples was referred to that of a gold film evaporated onto the sample substrate.

Figure 1 shows the valence-band photoemission spectra of La_{2}C_{3} measured at 4.5 K with the He i\alpha and He ii\alpha resonance lines. We find three prominent peaks located at 1, 4, and 7 eV, respectively, in both He i and He ii spectra, while the relative intensity of these peaks are slightly different between the He i and He ii spectra, possibly due to the cross-section effect. We also find that the He ii spectrum shows an

 additional large doublet structure around 19 eV. This doublet structure is not seen in the He i spectrum because of the lower excitation energy in the He i measurement. We also show in Fig. 1 the electron density of states (DOS) of Y_{2}C_{3} calculated by the scalar relativistic self-consistent full-potential linear muffin-tin method within the local density approximation (LDA).[14] Since the calculation for La_{2}C_{3} is not available at present, we compare the present photoemission result with the calculation for Y_{2}C_{3} by taking account of the possible difference between the 4d (Y) and 5d (La) states. As seen in Fig. 1, the DOS calculated for Y_{2}C_{3} tracks well the energy position of experimentally obtained valence bands of La_{2}C_{3}, suggesting that the valence band consists of essentially the C 2p states and/or the difference between the Y 4d and La 5d states is just a small contribution to the valence band. According to the calculation,[14] the bunch of calculated DOS located at E_{F} and 4 eV is mainly due to the hybridized states of the Y 4d and C 2p orbitals, while the prominent DOS around 7 eV originates mainly from the C 2s orbital hybridized with Y 4d states. The sharp calculated DOS around 14 eV is mainly due to the C 2s states. It is noted here that another LDA calculation by Singh and Mazin[15] reported a similar result, with a small quantitative difference in the width and the position of the bands. We therefore assign the two bands in La_{2}C_{3} observed by photoemission at 1 and 4 eV to the La 5d and C 2p hybridized states, and the small peak at 7 eV to the La 5d and C 2s hybridized states. The broad shoulderlike structure around 15 eV in the experiment may correspond to the DOS at 14 eV in the calculation, although the weight is considerably small in the experiment. A large doublet structure around 19 eV in the He ii spectrum is assigned to the spin-split La 5p core level.[16] It is noted that the band calculation of Y_{2}C_{3} does not show such a doublet structure simply because the calculation does not include the Y 4p states.

Figure 2 shows ultrahigh-resolution photoemission spectra in the vicinity of E_{F} of La_{2}C_{3} measured with the He i\alpha resonance line at temperatures (4.5 and 15 K) below and/or above the T_{c} (6.5 K). The spectral intensity is normalized to the area under the curve. As seen in Fig. 2, the spectrum clearly shows a remarkable temperature dependence that is not accounted for by the simple temperature effect due to the Fermi-Dirac (FD) distribution function. The midpoint of the leading edge in the spectrum at 4.5 K is not at E_{F}, but is shifted by about 0.6 meV toward the high binding energy with respect to E_{F} (see the inset of Fig. 2). In contrast, the spectrum at 15 K has the leading-edge midpoint at E_{F}. It is remarked that the 4.5-K spectrum exhibits a small but distinct quasiparticle peak at about 2 meV, while it totally disappears in the 15-K spectrum. This temperature-induced spectral change certainly indicates the opening and/or closing of a superconducting gap as a function of temperature in La_{2}C_{3}. A closer look at Fig. 2 further reveals an anomalous feature of the quasiparticle peak, which is apparently broad and rounded in comparison with the sharp quasiparticle peak observed by ultrahigh-resolution photoemission in conventional superconductors such as Nb (Ref. [17]) and V_{3}Si.[18] The broad and rounded feature of the quasiparticle peak of La_{2}C_{3} is hardly accounted for with a single peak, suggesting that the quasiparticle peak consists of two components (peaks), indicated by arrows in Fig. 2. This behavior is obviously different from the conventional superconductors which well follow the weak-coupling BCS spectral function with a single gap, but rather shows a close resemblance to the spectral behavior of the two-gap superconductor MgB_{2}.[19, 20]

In order to examine the conjecture described above as well as to reveal the symmetry and the size of the superconducting gap(s), we have performed numerical fittings to the photoemission spectrum and shown the results in Fig. 3. At first, we examined the single-gap scenario by using the single _s_-wave or _d_-wave Dynes function N(\omega,\Delta,\Gamma) with the parameters of \omega, \Delta, and \Gamma, where \omega, \Delta, and \Gamma are the energy relative to E_{F}, the size of the superconducting gap, and the phenomenological broadening factor, respectively.[21] In the case of _d_-wave gap, we assumed a cylindrical Fermi surface. The Dynes function for each gap symmetry is multiplied by the FD function at 4.5 K, and then convoluted with a Gauss

  ian with a full width at half maximum of 1.7 meV to incorporate the instrumental resolution. Although we have tried many fittings within a reasonable parameter space of the gap size and the broadening factor, the experimental spectrum at 4.5 K is hardly reproduced in both cases as shown in Fig. 3(a), where we see that the quasiparticle-peak position and the leading edge are not well reproduced simultaneously within the single-gap scheme. These results suggest that the gap function beyond the single s- or d-wave symmetry should be taken into account to explain the anomalous superconducting gap of La_{2}C_{3}. As an alternative candidate of the gap function, we assumed the presence of two isotropic s-wave gaps, whose gap function is described as \alpha N(\omega,\Delta_{S},\Gamma_{S})+(1-\alpha)N(\omega,\Delta_{L},\Gamma_{ L}), where \alpha is the ratio between the two gaps, and S and L denote small and large gaps, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the fitting curve with a small gap of \Delta_{S}=0.5 meV and a large gap of \Delta_{L}=1.7 meV at \alpha=0.7 reproduces the photoemission spectrum very well, both in the shape of the quasiparticle peak and the position and/or slope of the leading edge. By assuming the BCS-like temperature dependence, we have estimated the gap size at 0 K to be 0.6 and 2.1 meV for the small gap and the large gap, respectively, which correspond to 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=2.1 and 7.2. This indicates that the large gap has the coupling constant in the strong-coupling regime, while that of the small gap is well below the weak-coupling BCS value (3.53). It is worthwhile to note that the well-established two-gap superconductor MgB_{2} also shows the coexistence of the strong- and weak-coupling gaps with 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}=4 and 1.[19, 20] A recent ^{13}C NMR experiment on Y_{2}C_{3} reported a characteristic kink of 1/T_{1}T around 3 K, greatly below T_{c} (15.7 K),[13] which is well explained by the presence of two gaps with 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}=5 and 2, consistent with the present photoemission result. The existence of a line mode due to the singlet-triplet mixing and/or the anisotropic s-wave gap may be unlikely in La_{2}C_{3}, because the fairly small broadening factor observed for the small gap (\Gamma_{S}=0.03 meV) suggests the nearly isotropic nature of the s-wave gap. All these experimental results support the existence of two superconducting gaps with the s-wave symmetry. Recently, the two-band effect on the superconductivity has been theoretically discussed for Th-doped Y_{2}C_{3} and La_{2}C_{3}.[12] The theory predicts that although the spin-orbit coupling lifts the spin degeneracy of bands in most of the Brillouin zone, the spin-split Fermi surfaces touch each other along certain directions in the Brillouin zone due to the high crystallographic symmetry, producing the multiband effects in the superconducting state, where the superconducting gap would have multiple components. In order to examine the proposed two-band effect and reveal the origin of the anomalous superconductivity in La_{2}C_{3}, it is strongly desired to perform angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to directly observe the momentum dependence of the superconducting gaps.

In summary, we have reported ultrahigh-resolution photoemission spectroscopy on noncentrosymmetric superconductor La_{2}C_{3}. The photoemission spectrum at the superconducting state clearly shows a quasiparticle peak just below E_{F}, indicative of the superconducting-gap opening. The quasiparticle peak is broad and rounded compared to that of conventional superconductors. The numerical fittings have revealed that the spectrum is hardly reproduced with a single s- or d-wave gap, but is satisfactorily explained by two gaps with the gap values of 0.5 and 1.7 meV, respectively. All these experimental results suggest that La_{2}C_{3} is a two-gap superconductor.
