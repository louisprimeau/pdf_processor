6 June 1986January 19  uranium atoms is fulfilled.

Both UNi_{5} and UCu_{5} crystallize in the structure shown in Fig. 1. In the original work of van Daal, Buschow, van Aken, and van Maaren[15] on UNi_{5-x}Cu_{x}, it was pointed out that replacing Ni by Cu leads to dramatic changes in the low-temperature behavior of these substances. While UNi_{5} has an essentially temperature-independent magnetic susceptibility below room temperature and stays paramagnetic, \chi(T) of UCu_{5} increases substantially with decreasing temperature and antiferromagnetic order is observed below 15 K. Moreover, the c_{p}/T ratio at helium temperatures is about one order of magnitude smaller in UNi_{5} than in UCu_{5}. For UNi_{5} and UCu_{5} the nearest U-U distances are 4.796 and 4.973 A, respectively, and it might be argued that the difference in this separation alone is responsible for the observed different behavior. In our first example we demonstrate that this is only partially true, particularly with respect to the behavior below 4 K, disregarding, however, in this discussion the recently discovered phase transition around 1 K in UCu_{5}.

In Fig. 2 we show the temperature dependence of the low-temperature specific heat of UCu_{5} and UCu_{4.95}Ni_{0.05} in the form of c_{p}/T vs T^{2} plots. It is evident that 1% Ni impurities on the Cu sites do not greatly affect the overall specific heat, but they are sufficient to suppress the c_{p} enhancement below 4 K. We recall that this enhancement, however, persists when 20% of the Cu sites are occupied by Ag atoms.[5] Therefore, it seems difficult to ascribe the change of the c_{p}/T ratio displayed in Fig. 2 to a simple size effect in the sense mentioned above. It is rather the electronic part of the above-mentioned background specific heat which changes upon larger variations of d_{\rm U-U}, as was shown in Ref. [15], and which is most likely due to band-structure effects. Our measurements of the electrical resistivity \rho in this temperature range reveal that \rho(T) is also quite different in UCu_{5} and UCu_{4.95}Ni_{0.05}. At 1.5 K, \rho of the Ni-doped material is at least a factor of 2 larger than that of pure UCu_{5}. In contrast, \rho(T) of UAgCu_{4} is almost identical to that of UCu_{5} between 1.5 and 10 K.[5]

In another example we show that changing the chemical composition of AuBe_{5}-type uranium compound may lead to drastic changes in the opposite direction, i.e., to the formation of a heavy-electron state, rather than its destruction as demonstrated above. For this purpose we consider UPt_{5} and UAuPt_{4}. The physical properties of UPt_{5} have been investigated before. \chi(T) below 300 K and the room-temperature valence-band photoemission spectrum were reported by Schneider and Laubschat,[16]c_{p}(T) was measured by Frings[17] between 1.5 and 15 K, and \rho(T) data between 1.5 and 300 K were published by de Visser, Franse, and Menovsky.[18] Although in UPt_{5} the U-U separation is 5.25 A and hence favorable for the formation of a heavy-electron state, the properties mentioned above indicate a much weaker trend to it than is observed in UPt_{5}, where the nearest U-U distance is approximately 1 A less. It is mainly the temperature dependences of c_{p} and \rho below 6 K which suggest the presence of spin fluctuations in UPt_{5}. As Frings points out, a T^{3}\ln T term is needed to properly describe c_{p}(T) below 6 K, and de Visser and co-workers note a T^{2} dependence of \rho below 5 K.

Some of the properties we just described change considerably when one Pt atom per formula unit is replaced by Au. Below, we demonstrate this by reporting results of measurements of \rho(T) and \chi(T) of UAuPt_{4} between 1.5 and 300 K and of c_{p}(T) between 0.15 and 15 K, and by displaying them in comparison with available data on UPt_{5}.

In Fig. 3 we show \chi(T) for UAuPt_{4} and UPt_{5} below room temperature, where the latter data are those of Ref. [16]. It may be seen that this change in chemical composition enhances the susceptibility by at least a factor of 2 at all temperatures. Above 60 K, \chi(T) of UAuPt_{4} may be described by a Curie-Weiss-type straight line corresponding to an effective moment p_{\rm eff} = 3.21\mu_{B}/(U ion) and a paramagnetic Curie temperature \Theta_{p} of -135 K. However, this simple interpretation is questionable because, in spite of the large negative value of \Theta_{p}, UAuPt_{4} does not order magnetically down to 0.15 K. Quite obvious is also the change in electrical resistivity as is shown in Fig. 4, where

Figure 3: Inverse magnetic susceptibility \chi^{-1}(T) of UPt_{5} and UAuPt_{5} between 1.5 and 220 K. The data for UPt_{5} were taken from Ref. [14].

  we present \rho(T) between 1.5 and 300 K for both UAuPt_{4} and UPt_{5}. Both sets of data were obtained in this work and our results for UPt_{5} are somewhat at variance with those reported by de Visser _et al._,[18] the main difference being the sizeably lower values of \rho obtained in our measurements. \rho(T) of UAuPt_{4} is clearly enhanced with respect to that of UPt_{5} and the enhancement increases with decreasing temperature. The temperature dependence of \rho of UAuPt_{4} approaches that of the heavy-electron uranium compounds UCd_{11} (Ref. [4]) and U_{2}Zn_{17}.[3]

The most dramatic change is observed in the temperature dependence of the low-temperature specific heat. This may be seen from the c_{\rho}/T vs T^{2} plots for both UAuPt_{4} and UPt_{5} shown in Fig. 5. The data for UPt_{5} are those of Frings.[17] The slight enhancement of c_{\rho} of UAuPt_{4} with respect to UPt_{5} observed at 15 K, increases steadily with decreasing temperature and below 5 K; c_{\rho}/T of UAuPt_{4} shows the characteristic upturn of heavy-electron materials. From our measurements down to 0.15 K we extrapolate a c_{\rho}/T ratio at T\rightarrow0 K of 725 mJ/mol K^{2}, indicating that the zero-temperature electronic-specific-heat parameter \gamma is eight times larger in UAuPt_{4} than in UPt_{5}. Below 1 K, the specific heat of UAuPt_{4} can be described very accurately by considering c_{\rho} due to electrons, the lattice, and a spin-fluctuation-type term of the form T^{3}\ln T. The resulting fit, however, clearly deviates from the experimental data above 2 K and therefore we have not much faith in that sort of interpretation, especially also because the resulting fit parameter of the spin-fluctuation temperature T_{\rm SF} = 9.5 K is equal to T_{\rm SF} in UPt_{5}.[17] The separation of the U atoms d_{\rm U-U} in UPt_{5} and UAuPt_{4} is 5.25 and 5.285 A, respectively. Although the change of about 0.7% is quite remarkable we tend to ascribe the large enhancement of c_{\rho}/T below 5 K again to a many-body effect and not to a size-induced band-structure effect which may, however, cause the specific-heat increase in UAuPt_{4} above 7 K.

From the temperature dependence of \rho we suspect, without definite proof yet, that UAuPt_{4} will ideally form an ordered compound with all the Au atoms occupying those Be sites of the AuBe_{5} structure that form large tetrahedra (see Fig. 1). Remaining deviations from the ideal distribution of the atoms on different lattice sites are most likely the cause for the absence of any phase transition in our samples. This statement is supported by the fact that all known heavy-electron uranium compounds undergo a phase transition at low temperatures unless it is suppressed by impurities or other imperfections of the crystal lattice. In other words, we may also state that we doubt that UAuPt_{4} is a uranium analogue to CeAl_{3} or CeCu_{6}, two heavy-electron Ce compounds that show no phase transition down to 20 mK. It is thus of interest to speculate what kind of phase transition is the most likely to occur in perfect UAuPt_{4}. In a previous comparison of low-temperature properties of heavy-electron U compounds[19] it became apparent that the superconductors UBe_{13} and UPt_{3} have distinctly larger electronic specific heats per unit volume \gamma_{\rm r} than all other compounds which order antiferromagnetically. For UAuPt_{4} we calculate a \gamma_{\rm r} value of 11.5 mJ/cm^{3}K^{2}, very close to those obtained for UPt_{3} and UBe_{13}, respectively. Hence, we conjecture that UAuPt_{4} may be a heavy-electron superconductor once it can be prepared in perfect enough form. This conjecture is also supported by the fact that the renormalized ratio of the values of the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility and specific heat (\pi^{2}k\frac{\delta}{3\mu\delta})(\chi/\gamma) for UAuPt_{4} is 1.43, close to the values found for the three known heavy-electron superconductors. This value is also near a phenomenological boundary separating magnets and superconductors, which was recently proposed by DeLong.[20]

Our last point is of general and fundamental interest. It should be possible to perform band-structure calculations for both UPt_{5} and UAuPt_{4}.[21] This would then allow one to test the significance of such calculations in conjunction with heavy-electron behavior because the large difference in the low-temperature specific heat of these two compounds should reflect itself in the calculated energy dependence of the electronic density of states, if band-structure effects were indeed responsible for the obviously different behavior.
