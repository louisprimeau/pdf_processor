###### Abstract

We studied the effect of nonmagnetic and magnetic impurities on superconductivity in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) by small-amount substitution of the Lu site and investigated structural, magnetic, and electrical properties of nonmagnetic (Lu1-Sc)\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\), (Lu1-x Y)\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\), and magnetic (Lu1-Ly)\({}_{3}\)\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\). The rapid depression of \(T_{c}\) by nonmagnetic impurities in accordance with the increase in the residual resistivity reveals the strong pair breaking dominated by disorder.

Recent discovery of high-\(T_{c}\) superconductivity in the FeAs systems has shed a brilliant light on Fe-based substances as a rich vein of new exotic superconductors.[1] In addition to deeper studies of the FeAs systems, it is also indispensable to explore the exotic superconductivity in Fe-based substances other than the FeAs family. Ternary iron silicide Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) is a non-FeAs-family superconductor discovered in 1980.[2] This compound crystallizes in the tetragonal Sc\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\)-type structure consisting of a quasi-one-dimensional iron chain along the \(c\) axis and quasi-two-dimensional iron squares parallel to the basal plane.[3] The superconductivity occurs at \(T_{c}\)=6.0 K, which is exceptionally high among the Fe-based compounds other than the FeAs family. According to Mossbauer experiments, Fe atoms in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) carry no magnetic moment.[4] Taking into account the absence of superconductivity in the isoelectronic Lu\({}_{2}\)Ru\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{5}\) and Lu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\),[5] Fe 3\(d\) electrons in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) should play significant role in the occurrence of the superconductivity.

To unveil the pairing mechanism of the exotic superconductivity, it is crucial to determine the superconducting gap function. In Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\), recent measurements of specific heat[6] and penetration depth[7] reported the evidence for two-gap superconductivity, similar to MgB\({}_{2}\) which is considered to be a two-gap _s_-wave superconductor.[8] The Josephson effect suggested the spin-singlet superconductivity in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\),[9] On the other hand, past experimental studies in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) reported peculiar superconducting properties which are different from MgB\({}_{2}\): for instance, a power-law temperature dependence of specific heat below \(T_{c}\) (Ref. [10]) and a remarkable depression of \(T_{c}\) by nonmagnetic impurities.[11, 12] In addition, recent photoemission spectroscopy in the superconducting state observed the gap opening without distinct coherence peaks implying the nodal structure,[13] in contrast to the two coherence peaks clearly observed in MgB\({}_{2}\).[14] It should be noted that "cleanliness" in terms of the electron mean-free path is necessary and common conditions to the occurrence of the multigap and the non-s-wave (e.g., _p_- or _d_-wave) superconductivities, and thus these are co-occurrable in the "clean" system.[15] In the multigap system, we should also take into account another possibility of the extended _s_-wave (\(s_{\pm}\)-wave) superconductivity in which the sign of the order parameter changes between the different Fermi sheets. This has recently been supposed as a possible pairing symmetry for the FeAs systems, both theoretically[16] and experimentally.[17] The recent and the past experimental reports in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) require studies on verification of the sign reversal of the superconducting order parameter.

The effect of impurity scattering is sensitive to the phase of the superconducting gap function.[18] The _s_-wave superconductivity is robust against nonmagnetic impurities while strongly suppressed by magnetic impurities. On the contrary, the non-_s_-wave even-parity superconductivity, with the presence of nodes in the gap, is sensitive to both nonmagnetic and magnetic impurities. The \(s_{\pm}\)-wave superconductivity, with the sign change of the order parameter between the different Fermi sheets, is expected to exhibit the impurity effects similar to the non-_s_-wave even-parity superconductivity.[19]

This Rapid Communication reports study of nonmagnetic and magnetic impurity effects on the superconductivity of Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) by small-amount substitution of nonmagnetic Sc, Y, and magnetic Dy for Lu. Earlier, a brief account of magnetic susceptibility studies in the solid solutions (Lu1-_x_R_x_)2Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) (_R_ = Sc, Y, and Dy-Tm) was reported in which \(T_{c}\) was depressed with \(R\) substitutions.[12] The present study particularly takes interest in the effect of disorder on the superconductivity in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\), and we study the correlation between \(T_{c}\) and the residual resistivity. We investigate structural, magnetic, and electrical properties of polycrystalline (Lu1-_x_R_x_)2Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) (_R_ = Sc, Y, and Dy). In addition, we investigate anisotropy of electrical resistivity in a high-purity Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) single crystal, motivations of which are described later with the results.

Polycrystals of (Lu1-_x_Sc)\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\), (Lu1-_x_Y_x_)2Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) (\(x\) =0\(\cdot\)0.07 and 1), and (Lu1-Ly)\({}_{3}\)\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) (\(x\)=0\(\cdot\)0.05 and 1) were prepared by arc melting stoichiometric amounts of high-purity elements in Zr-gettered Ar atmosphere. To ensure the sample homogeneity, the arc melting was repeated with turning over the melted ingot for more than ten times. A high-purity single crystal of Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) was grown by the floating-zone method. The polycrystalline and the single-crystalline samples were annealed at 1050 degC for 2 weeks. Powder x-ray diffraction patterns showed that all the samples crystallize in the Sc\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\)-type structure without any additional peak. dc magnetic susceptibilities and electrical resistivities were measured by using the Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System.

  Figure 1 depicts the unit-cell volumes of (Lu1-,Sc3,)2Fe5Si5, (Lu1-Y,Y)2Fe5Si5, and (Lu1-,Dy3)2Fe5Si5 as functions of the impurity concentration \(x\). The Vegard's law lines expected from the unit-cell volumes of Lu2Fe5Si5 (576.7 A), Sc2Fe5Si5 (553.4 A), Y3Fe5Si5 (597.1 A), and Dy2Fe5Si5 (595.7 A) are also presented. It is evident that all the samples obey Vegard's law: the unit-cell volume increases with \(x\) in (Lu1-,Y)2Fe5Si5 and (Lu1-,Dy3)2Fe5Si5, while it decreases with \(x\) in (Lu1-,Sc3,)2Fe5Si5. These results ensure that Y, Sc, and Dy atoms are properly introduced as impurities into the parent Lu2Fe5Si5 phase with the Lu-site substitutions.

Figure 2 depicts the magnetic susceptibilities of the polycrystalline Lu2Fe5Si5, (Lu1-,Y)2Fe5Si5 (_x_=0.05), (Lu1-,Sc3,)2Fe5Si5 (_x_=0.07), and (Lu1-,Dy3)2Fe5Si5 (_x_=0.03 and 0.05) as functions of temperature with _H_=10 000 Oe. (Lu1-,Dy3)2Fe5Si5 exhibits the pronounced Curie tail due to the inclusion of the magnetic Dy atoms, in contrast to the nonmagnetic behavior in Lu2Fe5Si5, (Lu1-,Y)2Fe5Si5, and (Lu1-,Sc3,)2Fe5Si5. Here, we estimate the concentration of Dy atoms in the present (Lu1-,Dy3)2Fe5Si5 from the Curie-Weiss behavior. The magnetic moment of Dy atom in Dy2Fe5Si5 estimated from the Curie-Weiss behavior is _m_=10.4\(m\), which is close to the free-ion value (_m_=10.6_m_). Using \(m\) = 10.4\(m\), the Curie-Weiss analysis tells us that 3.07% and 4.92% of Lu atoms are substituted by Dy atoms in the \(x\) =0.03 and 0.05 samples of (Lu1-,Dy3)2Fe5Si5, respectively, ensuring that the Dy atoms are properly doped as magnetic impurities in these samples. The inset to Fig. 2 displays the low-temperature magnetic susceptibilities with _H_=10 Oe, exhibiting the diamagnetism due to the superconducting transition. For all the samples applied in the present study, the onset of the diamagnetism coincides with that of the zero-resistance transition, and we adopt these onset temperatures as \(T_{c}\).

The electrical resistivities of single-crystalline Lu2Fe5Si5 are presented in Fig. 3 as functions of temperature. Superconducting transition occurs at _T__c_=6.1 and 5.8 K in the single-crystalline and the polycrystalline samples, respectively. For the single crystal, we investigate the anisotropy of the resistivity with the current \(I\) parallel and perpendicular to the crystal \(c\) axis, _I_[[001] and _I_][[110], respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, the _c_-axis resistivity _r_\({}^{\rho}\) is less than one third of the in-plane resistivity _r_\({}^{\rho}\)_ab in the whole temperature range. The normal-state residual resistivities are _r_\({}^{\rho}_{0}\)=7.0 _m_\(\Omega\) and _r_\({}^{\rho}_{0}\)=22 _m_\(\Omega\) cm, respectively. At 300 K, the polycrystalline resistivity _r_\({}^{\rho}\) exhibits an intermediate value between the single-crystalline _r_\({}^{\rho}\) and _r_\({}^{\rho}\)_ab_, _r_\({}^{\rho}\)(300 K) \(<\)_r_\({}^{\rho}\)(300 K) \(<\)_r_\({}^{\rho}\)(300 K). _r_\({}^{\rho}\)(300 K) is close to but smaller than _r_\({}^{\rho}\)(300 K), indicating that _r_\({}^{\rho}\) is a weighted average of _r_\({}^{\rho}\) and _r_\({}^{\rho}\)_ab_ which dominantly picks up _r_\({}^{\rho}\)_ab as a component rather than _r_\({}^{\rho}\). As the temperature is lowered below ~140 K, _r_\({}^{\rho}\) becomes slightly larger than _r_\({}^{\rho}\)_ab_. The normal-state residual resistivity of the polycrystal is _r_\({}^{\rho}_{0}\) =30 _m_\(\Omega\) cm, which is larger than _r_\({}^{\rho}_{0}\) and _r_\({}^{\rho}_{0}\), indicating that the polycrystal is "dirty" compared to the single crystal in terms of the electron mean-free path.

The inset to Fig. 3 shows the low-temperature resistivities _r_\({}^{\rho}\), _r_\({}^{\rho}\)_ab_, and _r_\({}^{\rho}\)_normalized to the values at 300 K, _r_\({}^{\rho}\)(_T_)/_r_\({}^{\rho}\)(300 K). It is evident that _r_\({}^{\rho}\) and _r_\({}^{\rho}\)_ab_ exhibit almost identical _r_(_T_)/_r_\({}^{\rho}\)(300 K): for the residual resistivities _r_\({}^{\rho}_{0}\) and _r_\({}^{\rho}_{0}\), _r_\({}^{\rho}\)(300 K) = 0.04. Since _r_(T)/_r_\({}^{\rho}\)(300 K) cancels the

Solid, dotted, and dashed lines denote the Vegardâ€™s law in (Lu1-,Sc3,)2Fe5Si5, (Lu1-,Y)2Fe5Si5, and (Lu1-,Dy3)2Fe5Si5, respectively.

  contribution of the carrier density, and purely sees the variation in the electron mean-free path, the isotropy of \(\rho(T)/\rho(300~{}\) K) in the single crystal indicates the isotropy of the electron mean-free path. Thus, it is ensured that the normalized resistivity \(\rho(T)/\rho(300~{}\) K) is a good measure of the electron mean-free path regardless of single crystal and polycrystal in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\). Similar to the "absolute" residual resistivities \(\rho_{0}^{2}\), \(\rho_{0}^{2}\), and \(\rho_{0}^{ab}\), the normalized residual resistivity \(\rho_{0}/\rho(300~{}\) K) in the inset to Fig. 3 tells us that the polycrystalline Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) is dirty compared to the single crystal.

On the basis of the isotropic electron mean-free path revealed by the single-crystalline resistivities, we now study the influence of disorder on the superconductivity in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) by investigating the variation in \(T_{c}\) with \(\rho_{0}/\rho(300~{}\) K) in the polycrystalline samples. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) depict the normalized resistivity \(\rho(T)/\rho(300~{}\) K) of nonmagnetic (Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Y\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) and (Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Sc\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) as a function of temperature, respectively. Figure 4(a) also displays \(\rho(T)/\rho(300~{}\)K) of magnetic (Lu\({}_{1-y}\)Dy\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\). It is noteworthy that the small amount of the Lu-site substitution in nonmagnetic (Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Y\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) and (Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Sc\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) rapidly depresses \(T_{c}\) with the systematic increase in the residual resistivity. Here, we would like to comment on the chemical pressure effect on \(T_{c}\) in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\). The unit-cell volume variations in Fig. 1 tell us that Y and Sc substitutions for Lu apply negative and positive chemical pressures, respectively. It is noted that \(T_{c}\) of Y\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) and Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) under hydrostatic pressure exhibits positive and negative pressure coefficients, \(dT_{c}/dp\!>\!0\) and \(dT_{c}/dp\!<\!0\), respectively.[20] These \(T_{c}\) variations imply that both the negative and the positive pressures might favor \(T_{c}\) in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\). However, considering the difference of \(T_{c}\) in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) (6.1 K) \(-\)Y\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) (2.6 K), and Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\)\(-\)Sc\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) (4.6 K) the expected decreases in \(T_{c}\) by the chemical pressure for (Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Y\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) and (Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Sc\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) at \(x\!=\!0.07\) are \(\Delta T_{c}\!=\!-0.25\) and \(-0.1\) K, respectively. These values are much smaller than the \(T_{c}\) depression of (Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Y\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) and (Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Sc\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) in Fig. 4; \(\Delta T_{c}\!=\!-2.5\) K at \(x\!=\!0.07\). Thus, we conclude that the rapid \(T_{c}\) depressions of Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) in Fig. 4 are dominated by the pair breaking by impurities. And the present results clearly indicate that the _introduction of disorder gives rise to the nonpolar breaking in_ Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\). For magnetic (Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Dy\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\), \(T_{c}\) is also steeply depressed with the Dy doping. Comparing the Dy- and the Y-doped samples at \(x\!=\!0.05\), which exhibit almost the same residual resistivities, \(T_{c}\!=\!3.8\) K of (Lu\({}_{0.95}\)Dy\({}_{0.05}\))\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) is a little lower than \(T_{c}\)=4.2 K of Lu\({}_{0.95}\)Y\({}_{0.05}\))\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\). In (Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Dy\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\), as evident from Fig. 2, the Dy doping introduces the magnetic scattering potential. Thus the pair breaking in (Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Dy\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) a little stronger than (Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Y\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) is attributed to the magnetic scattering, which is compatible with the spin-singlet pairing in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\).[9]

Figure 5 displays nonmagnetic and magnetic impurity effects on \(T_{c}\) in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) (this work) compared with MgB\({}_{2}\).[21] For MgB\({}_{2}\), the \(T_{c}\) depression by nonmagnetic impurities (Zn) is negligibly small while magnetic impurities (Mn) strongly depress \(T_{c}\), indicative of the \(s\)-wave pairing. Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\), on the other hand, exhibits a strong \(T_{c}\) depression with doping regardless of nonmagnetic and magnetic impurities. As already mentioned in conjunction with Fig. 4, \(T_{c}\) of Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) rapidly depressed by nonmagnetic impurities in accordance with the increase in the residual resistivity. Such a disorder-sensitive superconductivity compellingly suggests the _sign reversal of the superconducting order parameter_.

In the sign-reversal order parameter, it is expected that the pair breaking by disorder results in vanishing of \(T_{c}\) at a critical residual resistivity \(\rho_{0}(0)\) in which the electron mean-free path \(l_{0}\) is on the order of the superconducting coherence length \(\xi_{0}\) (\(l_{0}\!=\!\xi_{0}\)). The inset to Fig. 5 shows the \(T_{c}\) depression of Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) as a function of the normalized residual resistivity \(\rho_{0}/\rho(300~{}\)K). The dotted line in this figure is a linear fit to the experimental plots of nonmagnetic

Figure 5: (Color online) The \(T_{c}\) depression of Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) as a function of nonmagnetic (Y,Sc) and magnetic (Dy) impurity concentrations \(x\). Nonmagnetic (Zn) and magnetic (Mn) impurity effects on \(T_{c}\) in MgB\({}_{2}\) (Ref. [21]) are displayed for comparison. Inset shows the \(T_{c}\) depression of Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) as a function of the normalized residual resistivity \(\rho_{0}/\rho(300~{}\)K).

  (Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Y\({}_{\rm J}\))\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) and (Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Sc\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\). Extrapolating this line to \(T_{c}\)=0 expects that the superconductivity disappears at \(\rho_{0}(0)/\rho(300\) K) = 0.3. For the estimation of the critical residual resistivity \(\rho_{0}(0)\), we assume that the temperature-dependent part of the resistivity, \(\Delta\rho(T)\)=\(\rho(T)-\rho_{0}\), is independent of the small amount of the nonmagnetic impurities. And we utilize \(\Delta\rho(300\) K) of the single-crystalline Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) in Fig. 3 for the \(\rho_{0}(0)\) estimation: \(c\)-axis \(\Delta\rho^{c}(300\) K) =158 \(\mu\Omega\) cm and in-plane \(\Delta\rho^{ab}(300\) K) = 513 \(\mu\Omega\) cm, respectively. Using these \(\Delta\rho(300\) K) values, \(\rho_{0}(0)/(300\) K) = \(\rho_{0}(0)/[\rho_{0}(0)+\Delta\rho(300\) K)] = 0.3 leads to the critical residual resistivities, \(c\)-axis \(\rho_{0}^{c}(0)\)=68 \(\mu\Omega\) cm and in-plane \(\rho_{0}^{ab}(0)\)=220 \(\mu\Omega\) cm, respectively.

Concerning the in-plane \(\rho_{0}^{ab}(0)\)=220 \(\mu\Omega\) cm, we would like to roughly estimate the corresponding electron mean-free path \(l_{0}^{ab}\) by using the formula \(l_{0}^{ab}\) = \(h(3\pi^{2})^{13}/[e^{2}n^{2/3}\rho_{0}^{ab}(0)]\). For Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\), the in-plane Hall coefficient in low temperatures, \(R_{H}\)\(\approx\) 1.5\(\times\)10\({}^{-9}\) M\({}^{-5}\)\({}^{-1,6}\) leads to \(1/R_{H}\)\(\approx\) 4.2\(\times\)10\({}^{27}\) m\({}^{-3}\). Substituting this \(1/R_{H}\)\(\epsilon\) value for the carrier density \(n\) in the above \(l_{0}^{ab}\) formula calculates \(l_{0}^{ab}\)=22 A. On the other hand, the upper critical field \(\mu_{0}H_{c}(2)\)\(\approx\)13 T with \(H\)\(\mid\)\(c\) in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) (Refs. 6 and 7) calculates the in-plane coherence length \(\xi_{0}^{ab}\)\(\approx\) 50 A. These \(l_{0}^{ab}\) and \(\xi_{0}^{ab}\) are comparable within an order of magnitude, but \(l_{0}^{ab}\)\(<\)\(\xi_{0}^{ab}\). We note here that the temperature-dependent \(R_{H}\) in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) is indicative of the multiband feature.[6] In the multiband system, \(1/R_{H}\)\(\epsilon\) is no longer the correct expression for the carrier density and might become larger than the true carrier density when the contributions of electron and hole bands cancel each other in \(R_{H}\).[22] The smaller \(l_{0}^{ab}\) than \(\xi_{0}^{ab}\) might be attributed to the overestimation of \(n\) due to the multiband feature.

The present study provides a strong evidence for the sign reversal of the superconducting order parameter in the multigap structure in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\). However, the present study is insufficient to distinguish between the non-\(s\)-wave even-parity and the \(s_{z}\)-wave pairings. Further experiments which probe angle-resolved information, such as magnetothermal experiments with rotating magnetic field, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy should be performed to determine the superconducting gap structure of Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\).

In summary, we studied the effect of nonmagnetic and magnetic impurities on the superconductivity of Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) by small-amount substitution of nonmagnetic Y, Sc, and magnetic Dy for Lu. The rapid \(T_{c}\) depression by nonmagnetic impurities in accordance with the increase in residual resistivity reveals the disorder-sensitive superconductivity in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\), providing a strong evidence for the sign reversal of the superconducting order parameter.

* (22) For instance, the Hall coefficient \(R_{H}\) of a two-band system consisting of electron and hole bands is written as \(R_{H}\)=\((n_{h}\mu_{h}^{2}\)\(-n_{e}\mu_{e})^{2}/[e(n_{h}\mu_{h}+n_{e}\mu_{h})^{2}]\). Here, \(n_{h}\) (\(n_{e}\)) is the carrier density of the hole (electron) band and \(\mu_{h}\) (\(\mu_{e}\)) is the mobility of the hole (electron) band.
