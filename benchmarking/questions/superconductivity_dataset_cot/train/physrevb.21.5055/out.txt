###### Abstract

We have succeeded in preparing by chemical vapor deposition essentially single-phase, A15 Nb3Nb with the addition of small amounts of Ge or Si. The compositions and lattice parameters of the five samples reported on here are as follows: Nb3(Nb0.92Ge0.08), 5.239 A; Nb3(Nb0.82Ge0.18), 5.230 A; Nb3(Nb0.71Ge0.29), 5.219 A; Nb3(Nb0.61Si0.39), 5.213 A; Nb3(Nb0.46Si0.54), 5.192 A. Using these compositions and lattice parameters, the lattice parameter for pure A15 Nb3Nb is found to be 5.250 +- 0.005 A. The low-temperature specific heat of all five samples was measured from 1.4 to 11 K, showing bulk superconducting transitions in all cases, with T_{e} midpoint and \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} values as follows: Nb3(Nb0.92Ge0.08), 5.2 K and 1.24; Nb3(Nb0.82Ge0.18), 4.15 K and 1.16; Nb3(Nb0.71Ge0.29), 3.6 K and 1.27; Nb3(Nb0.61Si0.39), 5.4 K and 0.78; Nb3(Nb0.46Si0.54) 3.4 K and 1.16. Transition widths were in general quite narrow, less than 0.5 K, and for Nb3(Nb0.71Ge0.29), the transition width was 0.15 K. From the specific-heat measurements A15 Nb3Nb as a T_{e} of ~6 K, a \Phi_{D} of 270 +- 10 K, equivalent to that of bcc elemental Nb, and a density of states of 1.22 +- 0.1 states/eV atom. Microprobe analysis of the A15 Nb3Nb samples shows no detectable oxygen, i.e., < 0.2 at.%. In addition to the essentially single-phase samples, a predominantly A15 sample with a_{0} = 5.246 A and 50% bcc Nb second phase has been prepared, with less than 3% of the _B_-site atoms occupied by Ge, showing that A15 Nb may be stabilized by less than 1% second-atom additions.

## I Introduction

Up to this time, only one element, W, has been known to be stabilized in the A15 structure by small amounts1 (~5%) of second-atom additions. Vieland and Wicklund,2 in 1974 while preparing Nb3Ga and Nb3Ge by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) anticipated the present work by accidentially preparing nonsuperconducting (above 4.2 K), multiphase samples which contained high-lattice-parameter, 5.23- 5.25- A A15 material with 12-20% _B_-atom site occupation by Ge. The present work deals with 80-100% single-phase samples of high-lattice-parameter A15 Nb3Ge and Nb-Si, and uses small sample specific-heat measurements both to characterize the samples and to show conclusively that the observed superconductivity is associated with the majority, A15 phase and not with very small amounts of bcc Nb which may be present and which could confuse inductive or resistive measurements. By having a range of compositions that approaches closely pure A15 Nb3Nb, extrapolation of its properties may be convincingly carried out. These properties, in particular the density of states, _N_(0), may be compared to the recent band-structure calculation for A15 Nb3Nb by Pickett, Ho, and Cohen.3

## II Experimental

The samples were prepared by the hydrogen coreduction of chlorides of niobium and germanium and of chlorides of niobium and silicon in a manner similar to that described in the literature.4 Deposition temperatures ranged from 730 to 900degC for the samples containing Ge and from 875 to 925degC for samples containing Si. Prior to the deposition of samples containing Si, the copper substrate was clad with a thin layer of pure Nb to prevent attack of the Cu by SiC14 vapor.

Gas-flow conditions necessary to stabilize A15 Nb3Nb with Ge or Si are substantially different than those described in Ref. 4 for producing high-_T__e_ Nb3Ge. The ratio of H2:(NbCl5 +- GeCl4) or H2:(NbCl5 + SiC14) must be kept relatively low in contrast to the very large ratios required to produce high-_T__e_ Nb3Ge. It seems very likely that the A15 Nb3Ge phase boundaries in the 4-component Nb-Ge-Cl-H system are extremely dependent on the H2:HCl ratio. As this ratio is increased, the phase boundaries move in the direction of Nb3Ge, and as it is decreased they move toward Nb3Nb. Deposition temperature also seems to affect this movement, with the lower deposition temperatures favoring the Nb3Nb direction.

After preparation, samples were removed from the copper substrate tubes by cutting \frac{1}{2}- to 1-in. sections and immersed in a one to one HNO3:H2O copper etch solution. For the Nb-Si samples, a further etch of the back side of the coat was performed in HF:5HNO3 to remove the Nb backing. This etch was performed by coating the front of the coat with black Apiezon wax and controlling the etch by measuring the weight loss of the sample plus wax combination. Enough of the back side of the material was etched off (33-50 wt. % of the total coat weight) to insure total removal of the Nb backing. Total removal was also apparent upon grinding the coat to a powder, which was the next step for both the Nb-Si and the Nb-Ge systems.

Lattice spacings were determined using a 114.6-mm Debye-Scherrer power camera. Also, diffractometer traces were taken on the Nb3(Nb0.92Ge0.08) and the Nb3(Nb0.82Ge0.18) samples and are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. As may be seen qualitatively only a small amount of bcc Nb exists in the Nb3(Nb0.97Ge0.08), a0 = 5.239 A, sample and almost no detectable bcc Nb exists in the diffractometer trace for Nb3(Nb0.82Ge0.18). In order to quantify the amount of bcc Nb evidenced by these diffractometer traces, two calibration samples were prepared by grinding lightly together measured amounts of fine bcc Nb powder and powder from the Nb3(Nb0.71Ge0.29) sample, which contained no detectable bcc Nb. Figure 3 is a diffractometer trace of a 10 wt. % bcc Nb, 90 wt. % A15 calibration sample prepared in this way; Fig. 4 is similarly for a 30 wt. % bcc Nb, 70 wt. % A15 Nb calibration sample, where for the samples discussed in this work, wt. % is essentially equivalent to at. %. The intensity of the (200) bcc Nb and the (211) bcc Nb peaks compared to the intensity of the (321) A15 Nb peak in each of the four figures was determined. Comparing these relative intensities [bcc (200) to A15 (321) and bcc (211) to A15 (321)] for Fig. 1 with those in Fig. 3 implies that the sample shown in Fig. 1, Nb3(Nb0.97Ge0.08), has 18 wt. % bcc Nb; comparison with Fig. 4 implies 20 wt. % bcc Nb. Similar comparisons for Fig. 2, Nb3(Nb0.82Ge0.18), imply less than 3 wt. % bcc Nb in this sample. These estimates of second phase content for the Nb3(Nb0.97Ge0.08) and Nb3(Nb0.82Ge0.18) samples and estimates based on Debye-Scherrer results for the other samples are shown in Table 1, along with lattice spacings and other parameters for all the samples.

Figures 1 and 2 show the complete absence of the (110) peak, as did in fact traces using much higher sensitivity. Using a computer code, ANifac,5 to calculate relative intensities, this lack of (110) peak indicates that fewer than 10% vacancies exist on the _B_-atom sites in these samples; i.e., these samples are indeed essentially Nb3Nb. This is identical to the result for _b_-**W** stabilized by a few atomic percent of

  O, where the _B_-atom site also appears to be fully occupied. It should be noted that the observed intensity ratios for the A15 peaks in the diffractometer traces agree well quantitatively with the anifac calculations.

Compositions for the Nb3(Nb0,AgGe0.18), Nb3(Nb0.7Ge0.29), Nb3(Nb0.6i5i0.39), and Nb3(Nb0.4Si0.54) samples were determined by microprobe and in the case of Nb3(Nb0.6iSi0.39) was corrected for the presence of the second phase bcc Nb-Si of approximate composition Nb0.9Si0.03. For the other three samples, the presence of second phase was small enough that the composition of the entire sample could be taken as that of the A15 phase. The microprobe data, see Table I, were taken at both 10- and 15-keV incident electron energies at a detection angle of 38.5deg on 0.32-cm (\frac{1}{\text{b}}-in.)-diameter pellets pressed from the powder at 1 400 000 kPa (200 000 psi). Closure (the nearness of the summation of the measured amounts of the components to 100%) was quite good for something as porous as pressed powders and ranged from 96.9 wt. % to 99.1 wt. %. The weight percent figures are converted to atom percent by dividing by the respective molar weights. The two atom percent numbers are added together and defined as 100%, thus normalizing the two components. Accuracy of the microprobe results, based on data from at least five selected areas on each pellet, is +- a few tenths of a percent, see Table I. At first, the microprobe data indicated approximately 1 at.% C, which was found to be an adsorbed film from the pellet press, as this signal disappeared when the surface of the pellet was scraped away. No O or Cl (i.e., less than 0.2 at.%) was detected on the scraped surfaces either.

The compositions of the A15 Nb-Ge samples are shown in Fig. 5 plotted against lattice parameter and are seen to agree well with the extrapolation from the Ge-rich side of the A15 phase, where lattice parameter and composition data are well established. The composition for A15 Nb3(Nb0.97Ge0.08) is derived from Fig. 5, rather than from microprobe work.

Assuming A15 Nb3Nb has a0 = 5.25 A, as shown in Fig. 5, and that6 A15 Nb3Si has an a0 = 5.08 A, then the composition versus lattice parameter data for the A15 Nb-Si samples deviates substantially from Vegard's law. This has also been seen by the Stanford group6 in their low-lattice-parameter Si-rich Nb-Si work. This apparent deviation from Vegard's law may be a result of site switching, i.e., Si atoms on the _A_-atom chain sites. Site switching has been observed in radiation-damage studies to increase lattice parameters.7 This possibility of altered ordering in the Nb-Si samples will be discussed further below.

The small sample calorimeter used has been described elsewhere.8 The pressed pellets were of sufficient mass (30-50 mg) such that the addenda correction (known8 to +-5%) to the total measured specific heat of four of the samples was only 10% at 11 K and rose to approximately 30% at 11 K. For the fifth sample, Nb3(Nb0.46Si0.54), only 14 mg was available and the addenda contributions were 13% at 1.4 K and 60% at 11 K, resulting in larger uncertainty in the data for this sample. All of the pressed powder pellets had imperfect thermal contact between the constitutive grains, leading to a second decay constant in the decay constant method9 used to measure specific heat. This problem, known as the "_r_2 problem", was not of a serious nature in the temperature range of measurement and could be accurately corrected for following techniques described in the literature.9

Since the possibility existed that hydrogen from the CVD process was present in the samples, all samples were dehydrated by annealing at 750degC in 10-6 torr vacuum for 30 min. Evolution of a gas presumed10 to be hydrogen was observed only for the Nb3(Nb0.8ZGe0.18) sample. The lattice parameter for the unannealed sample was noticeably higher (5.236 A) than for the annealed sample (5.230 A). The lattice parameters and specific-heat data reported here are for the dehydrated samples. In addition, the specific heat of unannealed Nb3(Nb0.8ZGe0.18) was measured for comparison.

## III Results and discussion

The specific heats of the five dehydrated samples are shown in Figs. 6-10. Figure 11 contains the specific-heat data for both annealed and unannealed Nb3(Nb0.8ZGe0.18). The transition heights D_C_, are seen to be uniformly bulk in appearance and in some cases, the transitions are quite narrow in width. The  normal-state specific heat C_{n} is given by

\[C_{n} = \gamma T + \beta T^{3}\;\;.\]

The data shown in Figs. 6 to 10 have been fit to this equation by the method of least squares. The thermodynamic constraint shown in Eq. (2) provides an independent method for checking the accuracy of the fit obtained from Eq. (1).

\[\int_{0}^{T_{c}}\frac{C_{s}}{T}\;dT = S_{s}(T_{c}) = S_{n}(T_{c}) = \int_{0}^{T_{c}}\frac{C_{n}}{T}\;dT\;\;.\]

The superconducting and normal-state entropies S(T_{c}), calculated from the superconducting and normal-state heat capacities C_{s} and C_{n}, must be equal. Agreement between the two entropies, using the fitted parameters from Eq. (1) to calculate C_{n} below T_{c}, is better than 3% for all five samples. The results for \gamma and \beta are shown in Table 1.

The transition discontinuity \Delta C = C_{s}(T_{c}) - C_{n}(T_{c}), may be quantified as \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} and is also shown in Table 1. It is evident from the values that the samples studied definitely exhibit bulk superconducting transitions, with values comparable to the BCS prediction for \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} of 1.43.

Of special interest in these samples is the extrapolated T_{c} and N(0) for no second-atom additions. Figure 12 shows a plot of T_{c} midpoint versus composition for both the Nb-Ge and Nb-Si samples. As may be seen, the T_{c} for A15 Nb_{3}Nb is dependent  on the second atom used to stabilize the A15 structure. This is probably due to a difference in ordering for the two systems; i.e., the occupation factors for Ge and Si on B sites in the A15 A3_B_ structure are not the same. The variation of lattice spacing with Ge composition shown in Fig. 5 is consistent with most or all of the Ge atoms residing on B sites. If this were not the case, the agreement with data in the range of 15-25 at.% Ge, where the Ge atoms are known to reside mostly on B sites, would be much poorer. Radiation-damage work7 has shown that site switching in the A15 structure usually increases the lattice parameter. The absence of any positive deviation from Vegard behavior in Fig. 5 therefore effectively eliminates the possibility of significant site switching.

In the Si stabilized A15 Nb3Nb system, as discussed above, the lattice parameters measured show a substantial positive deviation from the behavior expected based on lattice spacings of 5.25 and 5.08 A for Nb3Nb and Nb3Si, respectively. This suggests that the degree of ordering may be changing with Si content; i.e., the fraction of the Si atoms present in the alloy residing on B sites changes with composition.

This apparent variation with composition of the degree of ordering on A and B sites results in substantial uncertainty in attempting to extrapolate to pure A15 Nb3Nb from the Si data. It is well established in A15 materials that _A_-_B_ site switching has a significant effect on T_{e} as well as lattice spacing; hence, for a system in which the ordering is changing with composition in an unknown manner, no basis exists for extrapolation. Because of this problem and also because of the large gap between the lowest composition Si data and pure Nb3Nb, it is therefore inadvisable to use the Si data to predict the T_{e} of pure A15 Nb3Nb.

The density of states, _N_(0), for A15 Nb3Nb may

  be derived from the measured g's by

\[\gamma = (\frac{1}{3})\,\pi^{2}k^{2}N(0)(1 + \lambda)\,  the density of states. One further result of their work is worth noting here: they found that putting Nb atoms on the _B_-sites weakened the interaction between _A_-atom chains. This would be expected to lower the transition temperature and is perhaps one explanation of the low (6 K) T_{c} predicted for A15 Nb3Nb from the present work.

One further parameter may de deduced from the data in Figs. 6-10 the energy gap, D. This technique is discussed fully in the literature.12 The energy gap normalized as 2D/_kT__c_ is predicted to be 3.52 by BCS and serves as an indicator, along with D_C_/g_Tc_, of whether a material is strong coupling (larger values) or not. Values derived from the C_{s} data indicate a range of from 2.6 to 3.4 for 2D/_kT__c_ for these samples which, coupled with the D_C_/g_Tc_ values given in Table I, indicate relatively weak coupling for A15 Nb3Nb.

Figure 11, which shows specific-heat data for both as-deposited and dehydrated Nb3(Nb0.82Ge0.18), shows the effect of the hydrogen to be minor in terms of density of states, but significant for D_C_/g_Tc_ and for Ph_D_. The Debye temperature for Nb3(Nb0.82Ge0.18)H_x_ is 295 K, indicative of a harder lattice than for the dehydrated sample, Ph_D_ = 271 K. The transition discontinuity is increased by dehydriding by about 45%, accompanied by a slight narrowing of the transition, while the actual transition temperature is apparently unaffected by this amount of hydriding.

One further speculative comment should be made, regarding Fig. 8, the specific-heat data for Nb3(Nb0.71Ge0.29). This sample has a very sharp transition, with a width of 0.15 K, and is single phase with a very sharp Debye-Scherrer x-ray pattern, with high-angle doublets resolved down to the (520) line. The flat region in Fig. 8 just above T_{c}, which is really based on only three data points, is puzzling for a sample with such a sharply defined transition. Even more puzzling is that this flat feature does not show up in inductive measurements of the pressed powder, whereas the transition at 3.6 K gives quite a large inductive signal. Considering the sharpness of the x-ray pattern, one could speculate that this feature in the data may be a martensitic transformation. Measurements in a magnetic field will be undertaken to resolve this issue.

## IV Conclusions

It is possible to stabilize A15 Nb3Nb by addition of less than 1 at.% Ge to the matrix. The resulting material is a bulk superconductor with a T_{c} of approximately 6 K and a denstiy of states of 1.2 states/eV atom. Similar stabilization of A15 Nb3Nb by Si results also in a bulk superconductor, with a higher T_{c} that extrapolates to 10.5 K for no Si additions and with apparently some important degree of site switching. The possibility is raised by the present success in preparing A15 Nb3Nb with slight second-atom additions that other elements may be prepared in their A15 allotropes, e.g., Ta, V, and Mo, by low-temperature preparative techniques such as sputtering, _e_-beam evaporation, or CVD.

The samples were prepared by the hydrogen coreduction of chlorides of niobium and germanium and of chlorides of niobium and silicon in a manner similar to that described in the literature.4 Deposition temperatures ranged from 730 to 900degC for the samples containing Ge and from 875 to 925degC for samples containing Si. Prior to the deposition of samples containing Si, the copper substrate was clad with a thin layer of pure Nb to prevent attack of the Cu by SiC14 vapor.

Gas-flow conditions necessary to stabilize A15 Nb3Nb with Ge or Si are substantially different than those described in Ref. 4 for producing high-_T__e_ Nb3Ge. The ratio of H2:(NbCl5 +- GeCl4) or H2:(NbCl5 + SiC14) must be kept relatively low in contrast to the very large ratios required to produce high-_T__e_ Nb3Ge. It seems very likely that the A15 Nb3Ge phase boundaries in the 4-component Nb-Ge-Cl-H system are extremely dependent on the H2:HCl ratio. As this ratio is increased, the phase boundaries move in the direction of Nb3Ge, and as it is decreased they move toward Nb3Nb. Deposition temperature also seems to affect this movement, with the lower deposition temperatures favoring the Nb3Nb direction.

After preparation, samples were removed from the copper substrate tubes by cutting \frac{1}{2}- to 1-in. sections and immersed in a one to one HNO3:H2O copper etch solution. For the Nb-Si samples, a further etch of the back side of the coat was performed in HF:5HNO3 to remove the Nb backing.

Total removal was also apparent upon grinding the coat to a powder, which was the next step for both the Nb-Si and the Nb-Ge systems.

Lattice spacings were determined using a 114.6-mm Debye-Scherrer power camera. Also, diffractometer traces were taken on the Nb3(Nb0.92Ge0.08) and the Nb3(Nb0.82Ge0.18) samples and are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. As may be seen qualitatively only a small amount of bcc Nb exists in the Nb3(Nb0.97Ge0.08), a0 = 5.239 A, sample and almost no detectable bcc Nb exists in the diffractometer trace for Nb3(Nb0.82Ge0.18). In order to quantify the amount of bcc Nb evidenced by these diffractometer traces, two calibration samples were prepared by grinding lightly together measured amounts of fine bcc Nb powder and powder from the Nb3(Nb0.71Ge0.29) sample, which contained no detectable bcc Nb. Figure 3 is a diffractometer trace of a 10 wt. % bcc Nb, 90 wt. % A15 calibration sample prepared in this way; Fig. 4 is similarly for a 30 wt. % bcc Nb, 70 wt. % A15 Nb calibration sample, where for the samples discussed in this work, wt. % is essentially equivalent to at. %. The intensity of the (200) bcc Nb and the (211) bcc Nb peaks compared to the intensity of the (321) A15 Nb peak in each of the four figures was determined. Comparing these relative intensities [bcc (200) to A15 (321) and bcc (211) to A15 (321)] for Fig. 1 with those in Fig. 3 implies that the sample shown in Fig. 1, Nb3(Nb0.97Ge0.08), has 18 wt. % bcc Nb; comparison with Fig. 4 implies 20 wt. % bcc Nb. Similar comparisons for Fig. 2, Nb3(Nb0.82Ge0.18), imply less than 3 wt. % bcc Nb in this sample. These estimates of second phase content for the Nb3(Nb0.97Ge0.08) and Nb3(Nb0.82Ge0.18) samples and estimates based on Debye-Scherrer results for the other samples are shown in Table 1, along with lattice spacings and other parameters for all the samples.

Figures 1 and 2 show the complete absence of the (110) peak, as did in fact traces using much higher sensitivity. Using a computer code, ANifac,5 to calculate relative intensities, this lack of (110) peak indicates that fewer than 10% vacancies exist on the _B_-atom sites in these samples; i.e., these samples are indeed essentially Nb3Nb. This is identical to the result for _b_-**W** stabilized by a few atomic percent of

  O, where the _B_-atom site also appears to be fully occupied. It should be noted that the observed intensity ratios for the A15 peaks in the diffractometer traces agree well quantitatively with the anifac calculations.

Compositions for the Nb3(Nb0,AgGe0.18), Nb3(Nb0.7Ge0.29), Nb3(Nb0.6i5i0.39), and Nb3(Nb0.4Si0.54) samples were determined by microprobe and in the case of Nb3(Nb0.6iSi0.39) was corrected for the presence of the second phase bcc Nb-Si of approximate composition Nb0.9Si0.03. For the other three samples, the presence of second phase was small enough that the composition of the entire sample could be taken as that of the A15 phase. The microprobe data, see Table I, were taken at both 10- and 15-keV incident electron energies at a detection angle of 38.5deg on 0.32-cm (\frac{1}{\text{b}}-in.)-diameter pellets pressed from the powder at 1 400 000 kPa (200 000 psi). Closure (the nearness of the summation of the measured amounts of the components to 100%) was quite good for something as porous as pressed powders and ranged from 96.9 wt. % to 99.1 wt. %. The weight percent figures are converted to atom percent by dividing by the respective molar weights. The two atom percent numbers are added together and defined as 100%, thus normalizing the two components. Accuracy of the microprobe results, based on data from at least five selected areas on each pellet, is +- a few tenths of a percent, see Table I. At first, the microprobe data indicated approximately 1 at.% C, which was found to be an adsorbed film from the pellet press, as this signal disappeared when the surface of the pellet was scraped away. No O or Cl (i.e., less than 0.2 at.%) was detected on the scraped surfaces either.

The compositions of the A15 Nb-Ge samples are shown in Fig. 5 plotted against lattice parameter and are seen to agree well with the extrapolation from the Ge-rich side of the A15 phase, where lattice parameter and composition data are well established. The composition for A15 Nb3(Nb0.97Ge0.08) is derived from Fig. 5, rather than from microprobe work.

Assuming A15 Nb3Nb has a0 = 5.25 A, as shown in Fig. 5, and that6 A15 Nb3Si has an a0 = 5.08 A, then the composition versus lattice parameter data for the A15 Nb-Si samples deviates substantially from Vegard's law. This has also been seen by the Stanford group6 in their low-lattice-parameter Si-rich Nb-Si work. This apparent deviation from Vegard's law may be a result of site switching, i.e., Si atoms on the _A_-atom chain sites. Site switching has been observed in radiation-damage studies to increase lattice parameters.7 This possibility of altered ordering in the Nb-Si samples will be discussed further below.

The small sample calorimeter used has been described elsewhere.8 The pressed pellets were of sufficient mass (30-50 mg) such that the addenda correction (known8 to +-5%) to the total measured specific heat of four of the samples was only 10% at 11 K and rose to approximately 30% at 11 K. For the fifth sample, Nb3(Nb0.46Si0.54), only 14 mg was available and the addenda contributions were 13% at 1.4 K and 60% at 11 K, resulting in larger uncertainty in the data for this sample. All of the pressed powder pellets had imperfect thermal contact between the constitutive grains, leading to a second decay constant in the decay constant method9 used to measure specific heat. This problem, known as the "_r_2 problem", was not of a serious nature in the temperature range of measurement and could be accurately corrected for following techniques described in the literature.9

Since the possibility existed that hydrogen from the CVD process was present in the samples, all samples were dehydrated by annealing at 750degC in 10-6 torr vacuum for 30 min. Evolution of a gas presumed10 to be hydrogen was observed only for the Nb3(Nb0.8ZGe0.18) sample. The lattice parameter for the unannealed sample was noticeably higher (5.236 A) than for the annealed sample (5.230 A). The lattice parameters and specific-heat data reported here are for the dehydrated samples. In addition, the specific heat of unannealed Nb3(Nb0.8ZGe0.18) was measured for comparison.

## III Results and discussion

The specific heats of the five dehydrated samples are shown in Figs. 6-10. Figure 11 contains the specific-heat data for both annealed and unannealed Nb3(Nb0.8ZGe0.18). The transition heights D_C_, are seen to be uniformly bulk in appearance and in some cases, the transitions are quite narrow in width. The  normal-state specific heat C_{n} is given by

\[C_{n} = \gamma T + \beta T^{3}\;\;.\]

The data shown in Figs. 6 to 10 have been fit to this equation by the method of least squares. The thermodynamic constraint shown in Eq. (2) provides an independent method for checking the accuracy of the fit obtained from Eq. (1).

\[\int_{0}^{T_{c}}\frac{C_{s}}{T}\;dT = S_{s}(T_{c}) = S_{n}(T_{c}) = \int_{0}^{T_{c}}\frac{C_{n}}{T}\;dT\;\;.\]

The superconducting and normal-state entropies S(T_{c}), calculated from the superconducting and normal-state heat capacities C_{s} and C_{n}, must be equal. Agreement between the two entropies, using the fitted parameters from Eq. (1) to calculate C_{n} below T_{c}, is better than 3% for all five samples. The results for \gamma and \beta are shown in Table 1.

The transition discontinuity \Delta C = C_{s}(T_{c}) - C_{n}(T_{c}), may be quantified as \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} and is also shown in Table 1. It is evident from the values that the samples studied definitely exhibit bulk superconducting transitions, with values comparable to the BCS prediction for \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} of 1.43.

Of special interest in these samples is the extrapolated T_{c} and N(0) for no second-atom additions. Figure 12 shows a plot of T_{c} midpoint versus composition for both the Nb-Ge and Nb-Si samples. As may be seen, the T_{c} for A15 Nb_{3}Nb is dependent  on the second atom used to stabilize the A15 structure. This is probably due to a difference in ordering for the two systems; i.e., the occupation factors for Ge and Si on B sites in the A15 A3_B_ structure are not the same. The variation of lattice spacing with Ge composition shown in Fig. 5 is consistent with most or all of the Ge atoms residing on B sites. If this were not the case, the agreement with data in the range of 15-25 at.% Ge, where the Ge atoms are known to reside mostly on B sites, would be much poorer. Radiation-damage work7 has shown that site switching in the A15 structure usually increases the lattice parameter. The absence of any positive deviation from Vegard behavior in Fig. 5 therefore effectively eliminates the possibility of significant site switching.

In the Si stabilized A15 Nb3Nb system, as discussed above, the lattice parameters measured show a substantial positive deviation from the behavior expected based on lattice spacings of 5.25 and 5.08 A for Nb3Nb and Nb3Si, respectively. This suggests that the degree of ordering may be changing with Si content; i.e., the fraction of the Si atoms present in the alloy residing on B sites changes with composition.

This apparent variation with composition of the degree of ordering on A and B sites results in substantial uncertainty in attempting to extrapolate to pure A15 Nb3Nb from the Si data. It is well established in A15 materials that _A_-_B_ site switching has a significant effect on T_{e} as well as lattice spacing; hence, for a system in which the ordering is changing with composition in an unknown manner, no basis exists for extrapolation. Because of this problem and also because of the large gap between the lowest composition Si data and pure Nb3Nb, it is therefore inadvisable to use the Si data to predict the T_{e} of pure A15 Nb3Nb.

The density of states, _N_(0), for A15 Nb3Nb may

  be derived from the measured g's by

\[\gamma = (\frac{1}{3})\,\pi^{2}k^{2}N(0)(1 + \lambda)\,  the density of states. One further result of their work is worth noting here: they found that putting Nb atoms on the _B_-sites weakened the interaction between _A_-atom chains. This would be expected to lower the transition temperature and is perhaps one explanation of the low (6 K) T_{c} predicted for A15 Nb3Nb from the present work.

One further parameter may de deduced from the data in Figs. 6-10 the energy gap, D. This technique is discussed fully in the literature.12 The energy gap normalized as 2D/_kT__c_ is predicted to be 3.52 by BCS and serves as an indicator, along with D_C_/g_Tc_, of whether a material is strong coupling (larger values) or not. Values derived from the C_{s} data indicate a range of from 2.6 to 3.4 for 2D/_kT__c_ for these samples which, coupled with the D_C_/g_Tc_ values given in Table I, indicate relatively weak coupling for A15 Nb3Nb.

Figure 11, which shows specific-heat data for both as-deposited and dehydrated Nb3(Nb0.82Ge0.18), shows the effect of the hydrogen to be minor in terms of density of states, but significant for D_C_/g_Tc_ and for Ph_D_. The Debye temperature for Nb3(Nb0.82Ge0.18)H_x_ is 295 K, indicative of a harder lattice than for the dehydrated sample, Ph_D_ = 271 K. The transition discontinuity is increased by dehydriding by about 45%, accompanied by a slight narrowing of the transition, while the actual transition temperature is apparently unaffected by this amount of hydriding.

One further speculative comment should be made, regarding Fig. 8, the specific-heat data for Nb3(Nb0.71Ge0.29). This sample has a very sharp transition, with a width of 0.15 K, and is single phase with a very sharp Debye-Scherrer x-ray pattern, with high-angle doublets resolved down to the (520) line. The flat region in Fig. 8 just above T_{c}, which is really based on only three data points, is puzzling for a sample with such a sharply defined transition. Even more puzzling is that this flat feature does not show up in inductive measurements of the pressed powder, whereas the transition at 3.6 K gives quite a large inductive signal. Considering the sharpness of the x-ray pattern, one could speculate that this feature in the data may be a martensitic transformation. Measurements in a magnetic field will be undertaken to resolve this issue.

## IV Conclusions

It is possible to stabilize A15 Nb3Nb by addition of less than 1 at.% Ge to the matrix. The resulting material is a bulk superconductor with a T_{c} of approximately 6 K and a denstiy of states of 1.2 states/eV atom. Similar stabilization of A15 Nb3Nb by Si results also in a bulk superconductor, with a higher T_{c} that extrapolates to 10.5 K for no Si additions and with apparently some important degree of site switching. The possibility is raised by the present success in preparing A15 Nb3Nb with slight second-atom additions that other elements may be prepared in their A15 allotropes, e.g., Ta, V, and Mo, by low-temperature preparative techniques such as sputtering, _e_-beam evaporation, or CVD.

As discussed in the text, the T_{c} extrapolated for pure A15 Nb3Nb (T_{c} = 6 K) from the Nb-Ge system is thought to be the correct value. This would be the first case of an A15, bcc allotropic pair where the T_{c} of the A15 structure was less than that of the bcc.
