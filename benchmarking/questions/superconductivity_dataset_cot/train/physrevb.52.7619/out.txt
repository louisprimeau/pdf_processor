###### Abstract

Charge transfer between the Cu-O chains and the Cu-O_{2} planes has been studied by far infrared reflectivity (FIR) and Raman scattering (RS) measurements on YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}_{\gamma} compounds with 0 \leq y \leq 1.46. Analysis of the reflectivity spectra by the four parameter semiquantum model shows the occurrence of the insulator/metallic transition for y = 0.76, in agreement with the de conductivity. The \omega_{\rm LO}-\omega_{\rm TO} frequency splittings related to the intralayer modes involving the atomic vibrations of the BaO and CuO_{2} planes decrease, whereas the \omega_{\rm LO}-\omega_{\rm TO} splittings related to the interlayer modes, involving the atomic vibrations of the Cu2-O4-Cu1 bonding, increase. We discuss three possible reasons for the change of the LO-TO splitting with increased fluorine doping: (i) charge transfer between ions which changes effective ionic charges; (ii) effect of lattice disorder induced by the fluorine, and (iii) the effect of the plasma in ceramics. We show that the charge transfer assumption is more than likely and is consistent with both FIR and RS investigations. Raman spectra exhibit frequency hardening of the O4-Cu2 modes and frequency softening of the O2-O3 modes with increased fluorine doping. The former points out the increase of the Coulomb interactions between ions within the interlayer bonds and the latter, their decrease and screening inside the CuO_{2} planes. The phonon line shape of the B1g mode related to the CuO_{2} planes changes with the fluorine doping. The phonon line shape depends on the electronic polarization operator (EPO) which has been related to the free-carrier density of the CuO_{2} planes. The increase of the EPO points out the enhancement of the free-carrier density in the CuO_{2} planes. The charge transfer is revealed by the increase of the ionic Coulomb interactions within the Cu1-O4-Cu2 interlayer bonds, and their decrease and screening by the free carriers enhancement inside the CuO_{2} planes as fluorine doping increases.

2004  parameter semiquantum (FPSQ) model, we have determined the evolution of the free-carrier density and the FIR active normal modes as functions of the fluorine content.[14] Strong enhancement of the plasma frequency near y = 0.76 shows the occurrence of the I/M transition at this fluorine content. The \omega_{\rm LO}-\omega_{\rm TO} frequency splitting related to the intralayer modes of the BaO and CuO_{2} planes decreases with increasing y, whereas the \omega_{\rm LO}-\omega_{\rm TO} splitting related to the interlayer modes of the Cu2-O4 bonding increases. We examine three possible reasons for the change of the LO-TO splitting with increasing fluorine doping: (i) the charge transfer between ions which changes the effective ions charges; (ii) the effect of lattice disorder induced by the insertion of the fluorine atoms into the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} matrix; and (iii) the effect of the plasma in ceramics, (i.e., the effect of the plasma energy variation in a dilute system of crystalline inclusions embedded into a matrix). We show that the two last effects are insufficient to explain the changes of the \omega_{\rm LO}-\omega_{\rm TO} splitting detected with doping increase, whereas the charge-transfer assumption is more than likely and consistent with FIR and RS measurements. Analysis of the Raman phonon energy shifts have permitted us to point out the increase of the effective Coulomb forces within the Cu2-O4 bond and their decrease inside the CuO_{2} planes. We develop an analysis of the deformation of the B_{1g} normal mode line shape related to the oxygen vibrations of the CuO_{2} planes. The electronic polarization operator (EPO), deduced from the phonon line-shape calculation, is found to be proportional to the free-carrier density of the CuO_{2} planes. The EPO increases with fluorine doping. This agrees with the enhancement of the free-carrier density in the CuO_{2} planes. The charge transfer is revealed by an increase of the ionic Coulombic interactions within the Cu1-O4-Cu2 interlayer bonds and their decrease and screening by free-carrier enhancement inside the CuO_{2} planes as fluorine doping increases.

The sample preparation and characterization by x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, and dc conductivity measurements are given in Sec. II. The FIR and RS experimental techniques are described in Sec. III. The FIR and RS investigations are developed in Secs. IV and V, respectively.

## II Sample preparation and characterization

The YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} starting samples were synthesized from stoichiometric amounts of Y_{2}O_{3}, BaCO_{3}, and CuO heated for 2 h at 970 degC in an alumina boat and quenched in air. The powder obtained was reground. Many identical pellets (diameter = 6 mm, thickness =2 mm, mass =200 mg) pressed at a uniaxial pressure of 1 kbar were sintered for 2 h at 970 degC and air quenched. The samples were then heated at about 700 degC under a dynamic vacuum for several hours in order to obtain the tetragonal phase. Series of samples were then heated under an NF_{3} flow at 320 degC for various periods of time given in Table 1. More details of the thermal treatment are given elsewhere.[15]^{-}[17] During fluorination, the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}F_{y} structure remains tetragonal. Indeed x-ray-diffraction measurements show no evidence of a T/O phase transition in contrast to the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} structure during oxygenation. The lattice parameters as a function of fluorine content are listed in Table 1. The "a" parameter increases smoothly with fluorine doping while the "c" parameter decreases for fluorine content higher than y = 0.17. Evidence for fluorine insertion was first given by a classical chemical test using alizarine.[15] Thermogravimetric measurements have confirmed the presence of fluorine in the pellets and the sample analysis carried out with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) coupled to a scanning microscope have permitted us to detect the presence of fluorine in the microcrystallites of the pellets.[17] Conservation of the tetragonal structure confirms the equiprobable repartition of the fluorine atoms into the O1 and O5 sites. The YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}F_{y} structure is shown in Fig. 1. Neutron-powder-diffraction measurement reveal the insertion of fluorine atoms inside the Cu1-Cu1 chains.[15]^{-}[17] The critical temperatures, T_{c}, have been obtained by magnetic susceptibility measurements. The transition onsets, T_{c}^{\rm onset}, are reported in Table 1; the typical transition width is \Delta T_{c} \approx 7 K. The superconductivity occurs in the metallic phase (y \geq 0.76). The T_{c}^{\rm onset} increases with the fluorine doping from y = 0.76 to 1.26, and then exhibits a maximum "plateau" near 55 K. The T_{c}^{\rm onset} behavior for 0 \leq y \leq 0.1.46 is similar to the T_{c}^{\rm onset} behavior of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} for 0 \leq x \leq 0.7.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}F_{y} & Time (mn) & Parameters (Å) & c & T_{c}^{\rm onset} (K) \\ y = 0.00 & 0 & 3.847(1) & 11.795(1) & \\ y = 0.17 & 15 & 3.857(1) & 11.801(1) & \\ y = 0.38 & 30 & 3.

  Resistivity measurements have been performed at room temperature on the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}F_{y} compounds using the Van der Pauw method.[17] Four indium contacts were ultrasonically soldered on the sample and the dc conductivity at room temperature as a function of fluorine content is represented in Fig. 2. The conductivity shows a sharp and strong enhancement of two orders of magnitude around y  0.76, which suggests a drastic increase of the free-carrier density in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}F_{y} compounds. The YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}F_{y} conductivity is of the same order of magnitude as that in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} ceramics.

## III Experimental arrangement

The far-infrared-reflectivity (FIR) measurements have been performed with a Bruker IFS 113 vacuum Fourier transform spectrometer, equipped with a liquid-helium-cooled Ge bolometer and a 6 \mum thick Mylar beam splitter. Each spectrum is the average of 100 scans recorded with a spectral resolution of 2 cm^{-1} using a quasispecular reflection unit working at an incident angle of 11^{\circ}. The reflectivity reference spectrum was obtained using a bulk-gold mirror; the uncertainty in reflectivity is \Delta R=\pm 0.01. The surface of the sintered pellets was polished using diamond pasts of 1, 0.5, and 0.1 \mum and petroleum spirit containing less than 0.01% water. FIR spectra were obtained from randomly oriented crystallites at the surface of the pellets.

Micro-Raman scattering (MRS) measurements have been carried out at room temperature with a U-1000 Jobin Yvon double monochromator using the 514.52 nm line of an argon-ion laser. A photomultiplier tube EMI 9863B was connected to a microcomputer for data collection. A microprobe in conjunction with the spectrometer produces a laser spot of a few square micrometers. A video camera, connected to the microprobe, allowed us to observe and focus the laser beam on the surface of a single crystallite. The incident and scattered light were focused and collected by the microprobe objective, leading to a perfect backscattering geometry. Orientation of the crystallite has been chosen, such as, the incident and scattered electric fields are parallel and contained in the (_xy_) plane of the crystallite. The electric polarization are denoted _x'_ [_x'_ does not have a particular axis orientation in the (_xy_) plane]. The instrumental resolution was \Delta=0.5 cm^{-1}. The intensity was maintained below roughly 10 W/cm^{2} in order to minimize possible thermal damage on the sample surface.

## IV Infrared measurements

FIR measurements on YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}F_{y} compounds (_y_ = 0, 0.17, 0.76, 1.11, 1.26, and 1.46) between 10 and 1000 cm^{-1} are shown in Fig. 3. The reflectivity spectra exhibit distinct structures which are attributed to the presence of phonon absorptions. These structures are clearly smeared with the fluorine doping at y  0.76. Simultaneously, the reflectance increases significantly, starting from R (_o_)  0.3 for y = 0 at o = 100 cm^{-1} to reach R (_o_)  0.8 for y = 1.46, a typical value for a metallic YBCO pellet.[18]^{-}[20] The enhancement of the reflectivity background and the smearing of the phonon structures are highly suggestive of the presence of free carrier. Therefore the quantitative phonon analysis in the

  YBa2Cu3O6F_y_ compounds has been restricted to y <= 0.76.

In order to estimate the evolution of the free-carrier density and the transverse and longitudinal optical frequencies, o_{O} and o_{O}, associated with the vibrational modes of YBa2Cu3O6F_y_, we have fitted the experimental spectra. The theoretical reflectivity function was obtained from the FPSQ model.14 The reflectance R (_o_) is related to the complex dielectric function e*(_o_):

\[R\left( \omega \right) = \left[ \left[ n^{*}(\omega) - 1 \right]/\left[ n^{*}(\omega) + 1 \right] \right]^{2}\,,\]

with the complex refractive index

\[n^{*}(\omega) = \left[ e^{*}(\omega) \right]^{1/2}\,.\]

In this model, the complex dielectric function is given by

\[\begin{equation*}{\mathrm{e}}^{*} = \varepsilon_{\omega}\left[ \prod_{i}\frac{\omega_{L,i}^{2} - \omega^{2} - i\omega\gamma_{L,i}}{\omega_{T,i}^{2} - \omega^{2} - i\omega\gamma_{T,i}} - \frac{\omega_{p}^{2} - i\omega(\gamma_{p} - \gamma_{0})}{\omega^{2} + i\omega\gamma_{0}} \right]\,.\end{equation*}\]

The first term in the brackets represents the phonon contribution while the second corresponds to the free-electron contribution. e_o_ is the high-frequency dielectric function. _o__L,i_ (_o__T,i_) and _g__L,i_, (_g__T,i_) are the longitudinal (transverse) optical frequencies and damping of the normal mode i, respectively. o_{p} is the plasma frequency which does not include e_o_. Usually, e_o_ is included in the plasma frequency denoted o_{p}.18,21-24 Here, _o__p_2 = e_o_.

  \gamma_{\rm TO},\gamma_{\rm LO} damping values correspond to 2% of \omega_{\rm TO} and \omega_{\rm LO} for y=0 and 0.17, and increase to 4% of \omega_{\rm TO} and \omega_{\rm LO} for y=0.76. The assignment of the atomic groups involved in each normal mode (see Table 3) are deduced from lattice dynamical calculations and previous FIR analyses performed on YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}.[19, 20, 27, 28]

At y=0, YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} has 11 infrared active modes which transform as 5\,A_{u}+6E_{u} irreducible representations of the D_{4h} point group. The five expected A_{2u} modes are detected, whereas five of the six predicted E_{u} modes are observed.[19, 20, 27, 28] As the fluorine content increases, the normal modes related to YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} shift in frequency or gradually disappear due to screening by the increasing charge density. We note in Table 3 the occurrence of a new mode at \omega_{\rm TO}=483.2 cm^{-1} which does not belong to YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}. Although we have not performed a polarized infrared analysis, we suggest that this mode is similar to the B_{1u} normal mode of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} representing the Cu1-O1 bond bending along the "c" axis.[29] We assign it to the Cu1-F bond bending along the c axis. Its frequency is lower than that for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, because the atomic fluorine mass is greater than the oxygen mass. This vibrational mode is pointed out by an arrow on the y=0.76 spectrum in Fig. 3.

A striking feature in Table 3 is the increase and decrease of the \omega_{\rm LO}-\omega_{\rm TO} frequency splitting related to the A_{2u} and E_{u} normal modes, respectively, as the fluorine atoms are inserted into YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}. This is valid for all the modes except for the Y-E_{u} mode. The \omega_{\rm LO}-\omega_{\rm TO} splitting of all the normal modes is strongly altered at the I/M transition. One can identify three possible reasons for the change of LO-TO splitting with the increase of the fluorine concentration: (i) the charge transfer between ions which changes the effective ion charges; (ii) lattice dynamics of an imperfect lattice; and (iii) the effect of plasma in ceramics. First, we discuss the charge transfer between ions and the effects of disorder due to fluorine atom insertion. FIR measurements on the pellets give both (xy)-plane and z-axis contributions of the electric fields.

For (xy)-plane contribution, the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller (LST) relation, valid for any number of atoms in the unit cell of a tetragonal structure, is given by[29]

\[\prod_{j}\left[\frac{\omega_{L_{j}}(E_{u})}{\omega_{T_{j}}(E_{u})}\right]^{2 }=\frac{\varepsilon_{\infty}^{\alpha\alpha}}{\varepsilon_{\infty}^{\alpha \alpha}}\ .\] (4)

The (xy)-plane contribution of the incident electric field couples to the modes of E_{u} symmetry. \varepsilon_{0} is the static dielectric function and \varepsilon_{0}^{xx}/\varepsilon_{\infty}^{xx}=4\pi\chi_{\rm vib}^{xx}/(1+4\pi\chi_{\rm ele}^{xx}), where \chi_{\rm vib} and \chi_{\rm ele} are the susceptibilities related to the ionic vibrations and the bound electrons, respectively (the LST relation does not take into account the free-electron contribution). The LST formula shows that the \omega_{\rm LO}-\omega_{\rm TO} splitting related to the E_{u} modes decreases when \chi_{\rm vib} decreases or (and) \chi_{\rm ele} increases in the Ba-O and CuO_{2} planes. Similarly, the increase of the \omega_{\rm LO}-\omega_{\rm TO} frequency splitting related to the A_{2u} modes is due to an increase of \chi_{\rm vib} or (and) decrease of \chi_{\rm ele}. The decrease of \chi_{\rm ele} for the A_{2u} modes indicates an enhancement of the interlayer bond ionicity along the c axis, whereas the \chi_{\rm ele} increase for the E_{u} modes is related to enhancement of the covalent bond character in the Ba-O and Cu-O_{2} planes during fluorination. The susceptibility of \chi_{\rm vib} is sensitive to local disorder inside the structure and thus sensitive to the fluorine atom insertion. At this step of the discussion, it is difficult to conclude and define what is the effect (charge transfer or imperfect lattice) responsible for the LO-TO splitting. However, it seems unlikely that any

We discuss now, in some detail, the effect of the plasma in ceramics. We model the ceramic as a dilute system of crystalline inclusions embedded into a matrix with an effective dielectric constant \varepsilon_{M}^{\rm xx}. All inclusions are assumed to have the shape of an oblate spheroid with semiaxes a=b and c<\!\!<\!a. Then the effective dielectric function of the system is equal to [30]

\[\varepsilon_{\rm eff}^{\rm xx}(\omega) = \varepsilon_{M}^{\rm xx} + p\left[(1-\gamma)\frac{\varepsilon^{\rm xx}(\omega) - 1}{1+n^{\gamma}[\varepsilon^{\rm xx}(\omega) - 1]} \right.\] (5) \[\left. + \gamma\frac{\varepsilon^{\rm zz}(\omega) - 1}{1+n^{\gamma}[\varepsilon^{\rm zz}(\omega) - 1]} \right]\ .\]

Here \varepsilon^{\rm xx}(\omega) and \varepsilon^{\rm zz}(\omega) are the components of the tensor of crystalline inclusions; n^{\ast}=(\pi/4)(c/a), and n^{\ast}=1-(\pi/2)(c/a) are the depolarization factors of spheroids, and p is the concentration of inclusions varying between 0 and 1. The factor \gamma describes the distribution of the orientation of inclusions. If all inclusions lie in the (xy) plane, \gamma=0; if the distribution is random, \gamma=\frac{1}{3}.

To emphasize the difference between the dielectric function used for the fit [Eq. (3)] without damping and that of Eq. (5), we take the simplest model for the dielectric function of crystallites,

\[\varepsilon^{\rm xx}(\omega) = \varepsilon_{\infty}^{\rm xx}\left[\omega_{\rm LO}^{2}(E_{u}) - \omega^{2}\right]\left(\omega_{\rm TO}^{2}(E_{u}) - \omega^{2}\right)^{- 1} - \overline{\omega}_{p}^{2}\omega^{- 2}\ \right]\ ,\] (6)

and neglect the contribution of vibration along the z axis. The \varepsilon^{\rm xx}(\omega) expression given by Eq. (6) is inserted into Eq. (5). A comparison between Eqs. (3) and (5) yields

\[\Delta^{\it FIT} = \Delta - \frac{A}{2(A+1)}\left\{[\overline{\omega}_{p}^{2} + \Delta - (A+1)\omega_{\rm TO}^{2}(E_{u})\right] + \left\{[\overline{\omega}_{p}^{2} + \Delta - (A+1)\omega_{\rm TO}^{2}(E_{u})\right]^{2} + 4(A+1)\Delta\omega_{\rm TO}^{2}(E_{u})\}^{1/2}\ \right\}\ .\] (7)

Here \Delta = \omega_{\rm LO}^{2}(E_{u}) - \omega_{\rm TO}^{2}(E_{g}) and A = [\varepsilon_{M}^{\rm xx}/(p(1-\gamma))]- 1 > 0. The quantity \Delta^{\it FIT} is the LO-TO splitting, obtained by using Eq. (3) without damping. From Eq. (7), it follows that the value of the splitting \Delta^{\it FIT} decreases with increasing plasma frequency \overline{\omega}_{p}. For weak dampings, this effect remains valid. The plasma effect in ceramics can explain the reduction of the LO-TO splitting of the E_{u} modes but cannot explain the increase of the LO-TO splitting of the A_{2u} modes. To eliminate this plasma effect in ceramics, optical measurements on c-axis-oriented thin films doped with fluorine are in progress.

## V Raman measurements

The Raman spectra of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}F_{y} pellets (with y=0, 0.17, 0.38, 0.76, 1.11, 1.26, 1.46) in the Z (x^{\ast}x^{\ast})Z configuration are displayed in Fig. 4. For y=0, we observe three Raman-active modes among the five modes theoretically expected for the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} structure. [1-6] The peak located at 139.5 cm-1 has been assigned to the A_{g} mode corresponding to the vertical motion along the c axis of the Cu2 atoms and the peak at 338.5 cm-1 to the B_{1g} mode related to the O2-O3 oxygen vibrating out of phase along the c axis. [1-6] The peak at 452 cm-1 is actually a superposition of two modes, as inferred from the spectra of compounds with increasing fluorine doping. These two modes of A_{g} symmetry correspond to the motions of the O2-O3 oxygens and the O4 oxygen vibrating in phase along the c axis. [1-6]

As the fluorine atoms are inserted into YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}, the intensity of the B_{1g} mode at 338.5 cm-1 and the A_{g} mode at 139.5 cm-1 significantly decreases, their line shapes become asymmetric and their full width at half maximum (FWHM) increases. The B_{1g} and A_{g} modes reside in the Z (x^{\ast}x^{\ast})Z configuration, T=300 K. The B_{1g} mode is located at 139.

  lated to the O2-O3 oxygen atoms of the CuO_{2} plane shift towards the low-frequency side, whereas the two A_{g} modes related to the Cu2-O4 bond stiffen. For intermediate fluorine content, two new bands centered at 113 and 588 cm^{-1} appear. The first one has been assigned to the normal mode related to the vertical motion of the barium atoms along the c axis and the second one does not belong to an eigenmode of either the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} tetragonal for the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} orthorhombic structures.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] This large band usually appears in the spectra of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} structures when the oxygen deficiency in the Cu-O_{x} chains induces a symmetry lowering, or an ordering of the new oxygen vacancies similar to the one detected in the ortho-II phase.[6] This mode was assigned to the horizontal motion in the CuO_{2} planes of the O3 oxygen atoms and is similar to the E_{u} infrared-active mode of the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} structure. In our case, this mode corresponds to a symmetry lowering induced by the insertion of fluorine atoms between two Cu1 sites. The presence of this mode is consistent with the insertion of fluorine into the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} structure, in the same manner as the observation of the infrared vibrational mode at \alpha_{\rm TO} = 485 cm^{-1} (Table III).

The frequency shifts of the A_{g} modes and the B_{1g} mode accompanying the fluorine insertion are represented in Fig. 5. The Cu2 and the O4 normal modes both present a similar hardening in frequency, whereas the O2-O3 normal modes vibrating in phase and out of phase soften. For all modes, strong changes in frequency appear in the vicinity of y= = 0.76. The barium mode becomes Raman active beyond y= = 0.76. The Cu2 and O4 modes exhibit a strong hardening near y= = 0.76 at the I/M transition. Then it is possible to detect changes of the interlayer vibrational normal modes associated to the Cu1-O4-Cu2 bonds at the I/M transition. Significant modifications of the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} phonon spectrum at the I/M transition have not been detected unambigously.[31] The two main reasons were the coincidence of the I/M and T/O transitions and the reduced interval of sample concentrations between 0 \leq x\leq 0.4. The hardening of the Cu2 and O4 normal mode and the softening of the O2-O3 modes are consistent with the charge-transfer hypothesis described in the FIR previous section. The ionic character of the interlayer bonds increases and the ionic Coulomb interactions are screened inside the BaO and CuO_{2} planes. The frequency shift of the apical O4 mode with the charge redistribution in the 123 systems has also been reported from Raman investigations on ({\rm YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}})_{m}/({\rm PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}})_{n} superlattices.[32, 33] The absence of the barium normal mode in RS spectra below y= 0.76 and its occurrence above y\geq 0.76 is not understood; it could be related to the local perturbation of the electronic polarization in the BaO plane at the I/M transition.

In order to study the free-carrier density fluctuations and show that the screening of the Coulombian interactions inside the CuO_{2} plane is mainly due to increase of the free carrier with increasing fluorine doping, we now focus on the line-shape deformation of the B_{1g} mode of the CuO_{2} plane with the fluorine doping. Different effects can produce a phonon asymmetric line shape (PAL). The two main effects are the interaction between a single phonon and an electronic continuum and the finite wave vector excitations which participate in Raman scattering. The finite wave vector excitations are coming from lack of translation invariance induced by lattice disorder. Two PAL's are detected in the Raman spectra [Fig. 4(d)], the first one at 144 cm^{-1} and the second at 337 cm^{-1}. These two phonons involve vibrations related to the CuO_{2} planes. We shall study the second one, which exhibits the most intense Raman peak and corresponds to the B_{1g} mode. A detailed analysis of the finite wave vector phonon Raman process has shown that Raman scattering by B_{1g} phonons is less sensitive to disorder than that by A_{1g} modes.[34] The FWHM increase due to the disorder can then be neglected for the B_{1g} modes. The backscattering geometry, described in Sec. III, gives the z direction for the phonon wave vector. Therefore, no significant asymmetric line shape due to finite wave vector is expected for the mode at 337 cm^{-1} because its dispersion curve is flat along the \Gamma-Z symmetry line at the Brillouin zone center.[35] For these reasons, we suspect that the PAL of the B_{1g} mode results from the interaction of the B_{1g} phonon with an electronic continuum of the same symmetry. The Raman scattering intensity associated with an interference between a single phonon and an electronic continuum is given by[36, 37, 38, 39]

I_{0} is an intensity factor which takes into account the intensity change due to the absorption coefficient variation of the material as fluorine is inserted into YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} and the microcrystallite surface quality. \omega_{0} is the frequency of the bare phonon, g is the dimensionless electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling constant, and \lambda is the intensity ratio between the electron and phonon Raman scattering. Let us denote by \Pi(\omega), the electronic polarization operator. \rho(\omega) is related to the EPO by \rho(\omega) = A\,\omega\,\mathrm{Im}\,[\,\Pi(\omega)\,]. A is a dimensionless constant of proportionality and the imaginary part of the EPO represents the number of electronic excitations per unit frequency interval (\omega,\omega + d\omega).

We have only considered the imaginary part of the EPO because the optical phonon energy falls inside the electron-hole continuum. The energy range of interest extends over the PAL centered at 337 cm^{- 1}, e.g., 300-380 cm^{- 1}. This allows us to consider \rho(\omega) as a constant which depends only on the fluorine content. The Raman measurements being performed at room temperature, between 300 \leq\omega\leq 380 cm^{- 1}, n\,(\omega,T) is constant (not far from 0.2). The e-ph matrix element, g, depends on frequency and temperature. However, since T = 300 K and the relevant frequency range is small (80 cm^{- 1}), the coupling factor g is assumed to be constant. g has been deduced from the fit of the undoped compound spectrum (y = 0) to the theoretical Raman scattering intensity, Eq. (8), and is found to be equal to - 0.2. The fits of the PAL with variable fluorine content are displayed in Fig. 6. We have determined the number of electronic excitations, \rho(\omega) at \omega_{0}, the frequency \omega_{0}, the factor I_{0}, and the ratio \lambda. In the calculation, the value of \omega_{0} has been constrained by another equation, \omega_{0} = \omega_{\mathrm{max}} + \Gamma/q, where \omega_{\mathrm{max}} is the experimental frequency of the PAL maximum, which can be deduced from the experimental data. The agreement between theory and experiment is quite good, which confirms the choice of the fitting parameters. The parameters I_{0}, \omega_{0}, and \lambda and the symmetric factor |q| are listed in Table 4.

The decreasing factor I_{0} is mainly due to an increase of the absorption coefficient. The increase of the ratio \lambda implies an increase of the electronic scattering rate. The number of electronic excitations \rho(\omega) near \omega_{0} as a function of the fluorine content is shown in Fig. 7. \rho(\omega_{0}) was extracted from the PAL of the B_{1g} mode localized in the CuO_{2} plane; therefore, \rho(\omega_{0}) represents the electronic excitations near \omega_{0} which come predominantly from the CuO_{2} planes. \rho(\omega_{0}) increases from y = 0 to 1.1 and

If we can calculate the electronic polarization operator \Pi(\omega) for finite temperature and variable density of carriers, we shall be able to derive the relation between the carrier concentration and _r_(_o_), in an I/M regime where the transition from a Boltzmann to a Fermi gas of carriers may occur with increase of carrier concentration. This calculation involves the electronic damping g which is large in YBCO materials.40 To make it tractable, we make several simplifying assumptions. First, we consider the spectrum of carriers as purely two dimensional (2D) and isotropic. Second, the 2D density of single electronic states _v_(_e_) is considered as a constant _v_(_e_) = _v_(0). Finally, we shall only take into account elastic and quasielastic scattering of carriers, for which the energy change is small compared with _k__B__T_. Under these assumptions, _r_(_o_) = A  _Im_[_ln_(_o_)] reduces to41,42

\[\rho(\omega) = A\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\omega\gamma(\varepsilon)}{\omega^{2} +\gamma^{2}(\varepsilon)}[n(\varepsilon) - n(\varepsilon + \hat{n}_{0})]\nu(\varepsilon)d\varepsilon\]

. Along with the assumption of the energy-independent density of states, we assume also an energy-independent damping g. The integral over energy reduces to

\[\rho(\omega) = A\,\nu(0)\frac{\gamma\omega}{\omega^{2} + \gamma^{2}}\int_{0}^{\infty}[n(\varepsilon) - n(\varepsilon + \hat{n}_{0})]d\varepsilon\]

, where _g_(0) is the 2D electronic density of states equal to _m_*/_p_(_m_* is the effective mass) and g is the eigenvalue of the quasi-elastic collision integral corresponding to the fluctuations of the electron distribution functions excited by the phonon.

To evaluate this integral, we use the exact Fermi-Dirac distribution function, n(\varepsilon) = \{\exp[(\varepsilon - \mu)/k_{B}T] + 1\}^{- 1}, which is valid for arbitrary degeneracy of the electron gas. The chemical potential is related to the density of carriers as follows:

\[N_{\rm 2D} = \nu(0)\int_{0}^{\infty}\,\left[ \exp\left[ \frac{\varepsilon - \mu}{k_{B}T} \right] + 1 \right]^{- 1}d\varepsilon\]

N2D represents the free-carrier density of the Cu-O2 planes. Calculating the integrals (12) and (13) expressing m in terms of N2D, we get finally

\[\rho(\omega) = A\,\nu(0)\frac{\gamma\omega}{\omega^{2} + \gamma^{2}}\left[ \frac{N_{\rm 2D}}{\nu(0)} + \hat{n}_{0} - k_{B}T\ln\,\left[ e^{\frac{\omega_{\rm 2D}}{\nu(0)}k_{B}T} + e^{N_{\rm 2D}/\nu(0)k_{B}T} - 1\,\right]\,\right]\]

For o0 <= 340 cm-1 and T <= 300 K, we have \hat{n}_{0} \approx 1.7k_{B}T. When N2D ~= 0, _r_(_o_0) ~= 0 and when N2D >= _g_(0)_k__B__T_, _r_(_o_0) tends to the limit A\,\nu(0)\gamma\omega_{0}^{2}\hat{n}/(\gamma^{2} + \omega_{0}^{2}). In the framework of this calculation, _r

###### Abstract

Charge transfer between the Cu-O chains and the Cu-O_{2} planes has been studied by far infrared reflectivity (FIR) and Raman scattering (RS) measurements on YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}_{\gamma} compounds with 0 \leq y \leq 1.46. Analysis of the reflectivity spectra by the four parameter semiquantum model shows the occurrence of the insulator/metallic transition for y = 0.76, in agreement with the de conductivity. The \omega_{\rm LO}-\omega_{\rm TO} frequency splittings related to the intralayer modes involving the atomic vibrations of the BaO and CuO_{2} planes decrease, whereas the \omega_{\rm LO}-\omega_{\rm TO} splittings related to the interlayer modes, involving the atomic vibrations of the Cu2-O4-Cu1 bonding, increase. We discuss three possible reasons for the change of the LO-TO splitting with increased fluorine doping: (i) charge transfer between ions which changes effective ionic charges; (ii) effect of lattice disorder induced by the fluorine, and (iii) the effect of the plasma in ceramics. We show that the charge transfer assumption is more than likely and is consistent with both FIR and RS investigations. Raman spectra exhibit frequency hardening of the O4-Cu2 modes and frequency softening of the O2-O3 modes with increased fluorine doping. The former points out the increase of the Coulomb interactions between ions within the interlayer bonds and the latter, their decrease and screening inside the CuO_{2} planes. The phonon line shape of the B1g mode related to the CuO_{2} planes changes with the fluorine doping. The phonon line shape depends on the electronic polarization operator (EPO) which has been related to the free-carrier density of the CuO_{2} planes. The increase of the EPO points out the enhancement of the free-carrier density in the CuO_{2} planes. The charge transfer is revealed by the increase of the ionic Coulomb interactions within the Cu1-O4-Cu2 interlayer bonds, and their decrease and screening by the free carriers enhancement inside the CuO_{2} planes as fluorine doping increases.

2004  parameter semiquantum (FPSQ) model, we have determined the evolution of the free-carrier density and the FIR active normal modes as functions of the fluorine content.[14] Strong enhancement of the plasma frequency near y = 0.76 shows the occurrence of the I/M transition at this fluorine content. The \omega_{\rm LO}-\omega_{\rm TO} frequency splitting related to the intralayer modes of the BaO and CuO_{2} planes decreases with increasing y, whereas the \omega_{\rm LO}-\omega_{\rm TO} splitting related to the interlayer modes of the Cu2-O4 bonding increases. We examine three possible reasons for the change of the LO-TO splitting with increasing fluorine doping: (i) the charge transfer between ions which changes the effective ions charges; (ii) the effect of lattice disorder induced by the insertion of the fluorine atoms into the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} matrix; and (iii) the effect of the plasma in ceramics, (i.e., the effect of the plasma energy variation in a dilute system of crystalline inclusions embedded into a matrix). We show that the two last effects are insufficient to explain the changes of the \omega_{\rm LO}-\omega_{\rm TO} splitting detected with doping increase, whereas the charge-transfer assumption is more than likely and consistent with FIR and RS measurements. Analysis of the Raman phonon energy shifts have permitted us to point out the increase of the effective Coulomb forces within the Cu2-O4 bond and their decrease inside the CuO_{2} planes. We develop an analysis of the deformation of the B_{1g} normal mode line shape related to the oxygen vibrations of the CuO_{2} planes. The electronic polarization operator (EPO), deduced from the phonon line-shape calculation, is found to be proportional to the free-carrier density of the CuO_{2} planes. The EPO increases with fluorine doping. This agrees with the enhancement of the free-carrier density in the CuO_{2} planes. The charge transfer is revealed by an increase of the ionic Coulombic interactions within the Cu1-O4-Cu2 interlayer bonds and their decrease and screening by free-carrier enhancement inside the CuO_{2} planes as fluorine doping increases.

The sample preparation and characterization by x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, and dc conductivity measurements are given in Sec. II. The FIR and RS experimental techniques are described in Sec. III. The FIR and RS investigations are developed in Secs. IV and V, respectively.

## II Sample preparation and characterization

The YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} starting samples were synthesized from stoichiometric amounts of Y_{2}O_{3}, BaCO_{3}, and CuO heated for 2 h at 970 degC in an alumina boat and quenched in air. The powder obtained was reground. Many identical pellets (diameter = 6 mm, thickness =2 mm, mass =200 mg) pressed at a uniaxial pressure of 1 kbar were sintered for 2 h at 970 degC and air quenched. The samples were then heated at about 700 degC under a dynamic vacuum for several hours in order to obtain the tetragonal phase. Series of samples were then heated under an NF_{3} flow at 320 degC for various periods of time given in Table 1. More details of the thermal treatment are given elsewhere.[15]^{-}[17] During fluorination, the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}F_{y} structure remains tetragonal. Indeed x-ray-diffraction measurements show no evidence of a T/O phase transition in contrast to the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} structure during oxygenation. The lattice parameters as a function of fluorine content are listed in Table 1. The "a" parameter increases smoothly with fluorine doping while the "c" parameter decreases for fluorine content higher than y = 0.17. Evidence for fluorine insertion was first given by a classical chemical test using alizarine.[15] Thermogravimetric measurements have confirmed the presence of fluorine in the pellets and the sample analysis carried out with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) coupled to a scanning microscope have permitted us to detect the presence of fluorine in the microcrystallites of the pellets.[17] Conservation of the tetragonal structure confirms the equiprobable repartition of the fluorine atoms into the O1 and O5 sites. The YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}F_{y} structure is shown in Fig. 1. Neutron-powder-diffraction measurement reveal the insertion of fluorine atoms inside the Cu1-Cu1 chains.[15]^{-}[17] The critical temperatures, T_{c}, have been obtained by magnetic susceptibility measurements. The transition onsets, T_{c}^{\rm onset}, are reported in Table 1; the typical transition width is \Delta T_{c} \approx 7 K. The superconductivity occurs in the metallic phase (y \geq 0.76). The T_{c}^{\rm onset} increases with the fluorine doping from y = 0.76 to 1.26, and then exhibits a maximum "plateau" near 55 K. The T_{c}^{\rm onset} behavior for 0 \leq y \leq 0.1.46 is similar to the T_{c}^{\rm onset} behavior of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} for 0 \leq x \leq 0.7.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}F_{y} & Time (mn) & Parameters (Å) & c & T_{c}^{\rm onset} (K) \\ y = 0.00 & 0 & 3.847(1) & 11.795(1) & \\ y = 0.17 & 15 & 3.857(1) & 11.801(1) & \\ y = 0.38 & 30 & 3.

  Resistivity measurements have been performed at room temperature on the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}F_{y} compounds using the Van der Pauw method.[17] Four indium contacts were ultrasonically soldered on the sample and the dc conductivity at room temperature as a function of fluorine content is represented in Fig. 2. The conductivity shows a sharp and strong enhancement of two orders of magnitude around y  0.76, which suggests a drastic increase of the free-carrier density in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}F_{y} compounds. The YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}F_{y} conductivity is of the same order of magnitude as that in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} ceramics.

## III Experimental arrangement

The far-infrared-reflectivity (FIR) measurements have been performed with a Bruker IFS 113 vacuum Fourier transform spectrometer, equipped with a liquid-helium-cooled Ge bolometer and a 6 \mum thick Mylar beam splitter. Each spectrum is the average of 100 scans recorded with a spectral resolution of 2 cm^{-1} using a quasispecular reflection unit working at an incident angle of 11^{\circ}. The reflectivity reference spectrum was obtained using a bulk-gold mirror; the uncertainty in reflectivity is \Delta R=\pm 0.01. The surface of the sintered pellets was polished using diamond pasts of 1, 0.5, and 0.1 \mum and petroleum spirit containing less than 0.01% water. FIR spectra were obtained from randomly oriented crystallites at the surface of the pellets.

Micro-Raman scattering (MRS) measurements have been carried out at room temperature with a U-1000 Jobin Yvon double monochromator using the 514.52 nm line of an argon-ion laser. A photomultiplier tube EMI 9863B was connected to a microcomputer for data collection. A microprobe in conjunction with the spectrometer produces a laser spot of a few square micrometers. A video camera, connected to the microprobe, allowed us to observe and focus the laser beam on the surface of a single crystallite. The incident and scattered light were focused and collected by the microprobe objective, leading to a perfect backscattering geometry. Orientation of the crystallite has been chosen, such as, the incident and scattered electric fields are parallel and contained in the (_xy_) plane of the crystallite. The electric polarization are denoted _x'_ [_x'_ does not have a particular axis orientation in the (_xy_) plane]. The instrumental resolution was \Delta=0.5 cm^{-1}. The intensity was maintained below roughly 10 W/cm^{2} in order to minimize possible thermal damage on the sample surface.

## IV Infrared measurements

FIR measurements on YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}F_{y} compounds (_y_ = 0, 0.17, 0.76, 1.11, 1.26, and 1.46) between 10 and 1000 cm^{-1} are shown in Fig. 3. The reflectivity spectra exhibit distinct structures which are attributed to the presence of phonon absorptions. These structures are clearly smeared with the fluorine doping at y  0.76. Simultaneously, the reflectance increases significantly, starting from R (_o_)  0.3 for y = 0 at o = 100 cm^{-1} to reach R (_o_)  0.8 for y = 1.46, a typical value for a metallic YBCO pellet.[18]^{-}[20] The enhancement of the reflectivity background and the smearing of the phonon structures are highly suggestive of the presence of free carrier. Therefore the quantitative phonon analysis in the

Figure 3: FIR measurements on YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}F_{y} with various fluorine contents, T = 300 K. The experimental curves are represented by dashed lines and the full lines represent the theoretical curves obtained from the FPSQ model.

Figure 2: dc conductivity \sigma, obtained from the resistivity measurements and free-carrier density N, obtained from the fits of the FPSQ model to the FIR spectra with various fluorine content, T = 300 K.

  YBa2Cu3O6F_y_ compounds has been restricted to y <= 0.76.

In order to estimate the evolution of the free-carrier density and the transverse and longitudinal optical frequencies, o_{O} and o_{O}, associated with the vibrational modes of YBa2Cu3O6F_y_, we have fitted the experimental spectra. The theoretical reflectivity function was obtained from the FPSQ model.14 The reflectance R (_o_) is related to the complex dielectric function e*(_o_):

\[R\left( \omega \right) = \left[ \left[ n^{*}(\omega) - 1 \right]/\left[ n^{*}(\omega) + 1 \right] \right]^{2}\,,\]

with the complex refractive index

\[n^{*}(\omega) = \left[ e^{*}(\omega) \right]^{1/2}\,.\]

In this model, the complex dielectric function is given by

\[\begin{equation*}{\mathrm{e}}^{*} = \varepsilon_{\omega}\left[ \prod_{i}\frac{\omega_{L,i}^{2} - \omega^{2} - i\omega\gamma_{L,i}}{\omega_{T,i}^{2} - \omega^{2} - i\omega\gamma_{T,i}} - \frac{\omega_{p}^{2} - i\omega(\gamma_{p} - \gamma_{0})}{\omega^{2} + i\omega\gamma_{0}} \right]\,.\end{equation*}\]

The first term in the brackets represents the phonon contribution while the second corresponds to the free-electron contribution. e_o_ is the high-frequency dielectric function. _o__L,i_ (_o__T,i_) and _g__L,i_, (_g__T,i_) are the longitudinal (transverse) optical frequencies and damping of the normal mode i, respectively. o_{p} is the plasma frequency which does not include e_o_. Usually, e_o_ is included in the plasma frequency denoted o_{p}.18,21-24 Here, _o__p_2 = e_o_.

  \gamma_{\rm TO},\gamma_{\rm LO} damping values correspond to 2% of \omega_{\rm TO} and \omega_{\rm LO} for y=0 and 0.17, and increase to 4% of \omega_{\rm TO} and \omega_{\rm LO} for y=0.76. The assignment of the atomic groups involved in each normal mode (see Table 3) are deduced from lattice dynamical calculations and previous FIR analyses performed on YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}.[19, 20, 27, 28]

At y=0, YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} has 11 infrared active modes which transform as 5\,A_{u}+6E_{u} irreducible representations of the D_{4h} point group. The five expected A_{2u} modes are detected, whereas five of the six predicted E_{u} modes are observed.[19, 20, 27, 28] As the fluorine content increases, the normal modes related to YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} shift in frequency or gradually disappear due to screening by the increasing charge density. We note in Table 3 the occurrence of a new mode at \omega_{\rm TO}=483.2 cm^{-1} which does not belong to YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}. Although we have not performed a polarized infrared analysis, we suggest that this mode is similar to the B_{1u} normal mode of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} representing the Cu1-O1 bond bending along the "c" axis.[29] We assign it to the Cu1-F bond bending along the c axis. Its frequency is lower than that for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, because the atomic fluorine mass is greater than the oxygen mass. This vibrational mode is pointed out by an arrow on the y=0.76 spectrum in Fig. 3.

A striking feature in Table 3 is the increase and decrease of the \omega_{\rm LO}-\omega_{\rm TO} frequency splitting related to the A_{2u} and E_{u} normal modes, respectively, as the fluorine atoms are inserted into YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}. This is valid for all the modes except for the Y-E_{u} mode. The \omega_{\rm LO}-\omega_{\rm TO} splitting of all the normal modes is strongly altered at the I/M transition. One can identify three possible reasons for the change of LO-TO splitting with the increase of the fluorine concentration: (i) the charge transfer between ions which changes the effective ion charges; (ii) lattice dynamics of an imperfect lattice; and (iii) the effect of plasma in ceramics. First, we discuss the charge transfer between ions and the effects of disorder due to fluorine atom insertion. FIR measurements on the pellets give both (xy)-plane and z-axis contributions of the electric fields.

For (xy)-plane contribution, the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller (LST) relation, valid for any number of atoms in the unit cell of a tetragonal structure, is given by[29]

\[\prod_{j}\left[\frac{\omega_{L_{j}}(E_{u})}{\omega_{T_{j}}(E_{u})}\right]^{2 }=\frac{\varepsilon_{\infty}^{\alpha\alpha}}{\varepsilon_{\infty}^{\alpha \alpha}}\ .\] (4)

The (xy)-plane contribution of the incident electric field couples to the modes of E_{u} symmetry. \varepsilon_{0} is the static dielectric function and \varepsilon_{0}^{xx}/\varepsilon_{\infty}^{xx}=4\pi\chi_{\rm vib}^{xx}/(1+4\pi\chi_{\rm ele}^{xx}), where \chi_{\rm vib} and \chi_{\rm ele} are the susceptibilities related to the ionic vibrations and the bound electrons, respectively (the LST relation does not take into account the free-electron contribution). The LST formula shows that the \omega_{\rm LO}-\omega_{\rm TO} splitting related to the E_{u} modes decreases when \chi_{\rm vib} decreases or (and) \chi_{\rm ele} increases in the Ba-O and CuO_{2} planes. Similarly, the increase of the \omega_{\rm LO}-\omega_{\rm TO} frequency splitting related to the A_{2u} modes is due to an increase of \chi_{\rm vib} or (and) decrease of \chi_{\rm ele}. The decrease of \chi_{\rm ele} for the A_{2u} modes indicates an enhancement of the interlayer bond ionicity along the c axis, whereas the \chi_{\rm ele} increase for the E_{u} modes is related to enhancement of the covalent bond character in the Ba-O and Cu-O_{2} planes during fluorination. The susceptibility of \chi_{\rm vib} is sensitive to local disorder inside the structure and thus sensitive to the fluorine atom insertion. At this step of the discussion, it is difficult to conclude and define what is the effect (charge transfer or imperfect lattice) responsible for the LO-TO splitting. However, it seems unlikely that any

We discuss now, in some detail, the effect of the plasma in ceramics. We model the ceramic as a dilute system of crystalline inclusions embedded into a matrix with an effective dielectric constant \varepsilon_{M}^{\rm xx}. All inclusions are assumed to have the shape of an oblate spheroid with semiaxes a=b and c<\!\!<\!a. Then the effective dielectric function of the system is equal to [30]

\[\varepsilon_{\rm eff}^{\rm xx}(\omega) = \varepsilon_{M}^{\rm xx} + p\left[(1-\gamma)\frac{\varepsilon^{\rm xx}(\omega) - 1}{1+n^{\gamma}[\varepsilon^{\rm xx}(\omega) - 1]} \right.\] (5) \[\left. + \gamma\frac{\varepsilon^{\rm zz}(\omega) - 1}{1+n^{\gamma}[\varepsilon^{\rm zz}(\omega) - 1]} \right]\ .\]

Here \varepsilon^{\rm xx}(\omega) and \varepsilon^{\rm zz}(\omega) are the components of the tensor of crystalline inclusions; n^{\ast}=(\pi/4)(c/a), and n^{\ast}=1-(\pi/2)(c/a) are the depolarization factors of spheroids, and p is the concentration of inclusions varying between 0 and 1. The factor \gamma describes the distribution of the orientation of inclusions. If all inclusions lie in the (xy) plane, \gamma=0; if the distribution is random, \gamma=\frac{1}{3}.

To emphasize the difference between the dielectric function used for the fit [Eq. (3)] without damping and that of Eq. (5), we take the simplest model for the dielectric function of crystallites,

\[\varepsilon^{\rm xx}(\omega) = \varepsilon_{\infty}^{\rm xx}\left[\omega_{\rm LO}^{2}(E_{u}) - \omega^{2}\right]\left(\omega_{\rm TO}^{2}(E_{u}) - \omega^{2}\right)^{- 1} - \overline{\omega}_{p}^{2}\omega^{- 2}\ \right]\ ,\] (6)

and neglect the contribution of vibration along the z axis. The \varepsilon^{\rm xx}(\omega) expression given by Eq. (6) is inserted into Eq. (5). A comparison between Eqs. (3) and (5) yields

\[\Delta^{\it FIT} = \Delta - \frac{A}{2(A+1)}\left\{[\overline{\omega}_{p}^{2} + \Delta - (A+1)\omega_{\rm TO}^{2}(E_{u})\right] + \left\{[\overline{\omega}_{p}^{2} + \Delta - (A+1)\omega_{\rm TO}^{2}(E_{u})\right]^{2} + 4(A+1)\Delta\omega_{\rm TO}^{2}(E_{u})\}^{1/2}\ \right\}\ .\] (7)

Here \Delta = \omega_{\rm LO}^{2}(E_{u}) - \omega_{\rm TO}^{2}(E_{g}) and A = [\varepsilon_{M}^{\rm xx}/(p(1-\gamma))]- 1 > 0. The quantity \Delta^{\it FIT} is the LO-TO splitting, obtained by using Eq. (3) without damping. From Eq. (7), it follows that the value of the splitting \Delta^{\it FIT} decreases with increasing plasma frequency \overline{\omega}_{p}. For weak dampings, this effect remains valid. The plasma effect in ceramics can explain the reduction of the LO-TO splitting of the E_{u} modes but cannot explain the increase of the LO-TO splitting of the A_{2u} modes. To eliminate this plasma effect in ceramics, optical measurements on c-axis-oriented thin films doped with fluorine are in progress.

## V Raman measurements

The Raman spectra of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}F_{y} pellets (with y=0, 0.17, 0.38, 0.76, 1.11, 1.26, 1.46) in the Z (x^{\ast}x^{\ast})Z configuration are displayed in Fig. 4. For y=0, we observe three Raman-active modes among the five modes theoretically expected for the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} structure. [1-6] The peak located at 139.5 cm-1 has been assigned to the A_{g} mode corresponding to the vertical motion along the c axis of the Cu2 atoms and the peak at 338.5 cm-1 to the B_{1g} mode related to the O2-O3 oxygen vibrating out of phase along the c axis. [1-6] The peak at 452 cm-1 is actually a superposition of two modes, as inferred from the spectra of compounds with increasing fluorine doping. These two modes of A_{g} symmetry correspond to the motions of the O2-O3 oxygens and the O4 oxygen vibrating in phase along the c axis. [1-6]

As the fluorine atoms are inserted into YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}, the intensity of the B_{1g} mode at 338.5 cm-1 and the A_{g} mode at 139.5 cm-1 significantly decreases, their line shapes become asymmetric and their full width at half maximum (FWHM) increases. The B_{1g} and A_{g} modes reside in the Z (x^{\ast}x^{\ast})Z configuration, T=300 K. The B_{1g} mode is located at 139.

  lated to the O2-O3 oxygen atoms of the CuO_{2} plane shift towards the low-frequency side, whereas the two A_{g} modes related to the Cu2-O4 bond stiffen. For intermediate fluorine content, two new bands centered at 113 and 588 cm^{-1} appear. The first one has been assigned to the normal mode related to the vertical motion of the barium atoms along the c axis and the second one does not belong to an eigenmode of either the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} tetragonal for the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} orthorhombic structures.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] This large band usually appears in the spectra of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} structures when the oxygen deficiency in the Cu-O_{x} chains induces a symmetry lowering, or an ordering of the new oxygen vacancies similar to the one detected in the ortho-II phase.[6] This mode was assigned to the horizontal motion in the CuO_{2} planes of the O3 oxygen atoms and is similar to the E_{u} infrared-active mode of the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} structure. In our case, this mode corresponds to a symmetry lowering induced by the insertion of fluorine atoms between two Cu1 sites. The presence of this mode is consistent with the insertion of fluorine into the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} structure, in the same manner as the observation of the infrared vibrational mode at \alpha_{\rm TO} = 485 cm^{-1} (Table III).

The frequency shifts of the A_{g} modes and the B_{1g} mode accompanying the fluorine insertion are represented in Fig. 5. The Cu2 and the O4 normal modes both present a similar hardening in frequency, whereas the O2-O3 normal modes vibrating in phase and out of phase soften. For all modes, strong changes in frequency appear in the vicinity of y= = 0.76. The barium mode becomes Raman active beyond y= = 0.76. The Cu2 and O4 modes exhibit a strong hardening near y= = 0.76 at the I/M transition. Then it is possible to detect changes of the interlayer vibrational normal modes associated to the Cu1-O4-Cu2 bonds at the I/M transition. Significant modifications of the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} phonon spectrum at the I/M transition have not been detected unambigously.[31] The two main reasons were the coincidence of the I/M and T/O transitions and the reduced interval of sample concentrations between 0 \leq x\leq 0.4. The hardening of the Cu2 and O4 normal mode and the softening of the O2-O3 modes are consistent with the charge-transfer hypothesis described in the FIR previous section. The ionic character of the interlayer bonds increases and the ionic Coulomb interactions are screened inside the BaO and CuO_{2} planes. The frequency shift of the apical O4 mode with the charge redistribution in the 123 systems has also been reported from Raman investigations on ({\rm YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}})_{m}/({\rm PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}})_{n} superlattices.[32, 33] The absence of the barium normal mode in RS spectra below y= 0.76 and its occurrence above y\geq 0.76 is not understood; it could be related to the local perturbation of the electronic polarization in the BaO plane at the I/M transition.

In order to study the free-carrier density fluctuations and show that the screening of the Coulombian interactions inside the CuO_{2} plane is mainly due to increase of the free carrier with increasing fluorine doping, we now focus on the line-shape deformation of the B_{1g} mode of the CuO_{2} plane with the fluorine doping. Different effects can produce a phonon asymmetric line shape (PAL). The two main effects are the interaction between a single phonon and an electronic continuum and the finite wave vector excitations which participate in Raman scattering. The finite wave vector excitations are coming from lack of translation invariance induced by lattice disorder. Two PAL's are detected in the Raman spectra [Fig. 4(d)], the first one at 144 cm^{-1} and the second at 337 cm^{-1}. These two phonons involve vibrations related to the CuO_{2} planes. We shall study the second one, which exhibits the most intense Raman peak and corresponds to the B_{1g} mode. A detailed analysis of the finite wave vector phonon Raman process has shown that Raman scattering by B_{1g} phonons is less sensitive to disorder than that by A_{1g} modes.[34] The FWHM increase due to the disorder can then be neglected for the B_{1g} modes. The backscattering geometry, described in Sec. III, gives the z direction for the phonon wave vector. Therefore, no significant asymmetric line shape due to finite wave vector is expected for the mode at 337 cm^{-1} because its dispersion curve is flat along the \Gamma-Z symmetry line at the Brillouin zone center.[35] For these reasons, we suspect that the PAL of the B_{1g} mode results from the interaction of the B_{1g} phonon with an electronic continuum of the same symmetry. The Raman scattering intensity associated with an interference between a single phonon and an electronic continuum is given by[36, 37, 38, 39]

and the Bose factor n\,(\omega,T) = \{\exp(\bar{n}\omega/k_{B}T) - 1\}^{- 1}. I_{0} is an intensity factor which takes into account the intensity change due to the absorption coefficient variation of the material as fluorine is inserted into YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} and the microcrystallite surface quality. \omega_{0} is the frequency of the bare phonon, g is the dimensionless electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling constant, and \lambda is the intensity ratio between the electron and phonon Raman scattering. Let us denote by \Pi(\omega), the electronic polarization operator. \rho(\omega) is related to the EPO by \rho(\omega) = A\,\omega\,\mathrm{Im}\,[\,\Pi(\omega)\,]. A is a dimensionless constant of proportionality and the imaginary part of the EPO represents the number of electronic excitations per unit frequency interval (\omega,\omega + d\omega).

We have only considered the imaginary part of the EPO because the optical phonon energy falls inside the electron-hole continuum. The energy range of interest extends over the PAL centered at 337 cm^{- 1}, e.g., 300-380 cm^{- 1}. This allows us to consider \rho(\omega) as a constant which depends only on the fluorine content. The Raman measurements being performed at room temperature, between 300 \leq\omega\leq 380 cm^{- 1}, n\,(\omega,T) is constant (not far from 0.2). The e-ph matrix element, g, depends on frequency and temperature. However, since T = 300 K and the relevant frequency range is small (80 cm^{- 1}), the coupling factor g is assumed to be constant. g has been deduced from the fit of the undoped compound spectrum (y = 0) to the theoretical Raman scattering intensity, Eq. (8), and is found to be equal to - 0.2. The fits of the PAL with variable fluorine content are displayed in Fig. 6. We have determined the number of electronic excitations, \rho(\omega) at \omega_{0}, the frequency \omega_{0}, the factor I_{0}, and the ratio \lambda. In the calculation, the value of \omega_{0} has been constrained by another equation, \omega_{0} = \omega_{\mathrm{max}} + \Gamma/q, where \omega_{\mathrm{max}} is the experimental frequency of the PAL maximum, which can be deduced from the experimental data. The agreement between theory and experiment is quite good, which confirms the choice of the fitting parameters. The parameters I_{0}, \omega_{0}, and \lambda and the symmetric factor |q| are listed in Table 4.

The decreasing factor I_{0} is mainly due to an increase of the absorption coefficient. The increase of the ratio \lambda implies an increase of the electronic scattering rate. The number of electronic excitations \rho(\omega) near \omega_{0} as a function of the fluorine content is shown in Fig. 7. \rho(\omega_{0}) was extracted from the PAL of the B_{1g} mode localized in the CuO_{2} plane; therefore, \rho(\omega_{0}) represents the electronic excitations near \omega_{0} which come predominantly from the CuO_{2} planes. \rho(\omega_{0}) increases from y = 0 to 1.1 and

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}F_{y} & \omega_{0} (cm^{- 1}) & I_{0} & \lambda & |q| \\ y=0.00 & 339.0(1) & 0.421(1) & 0.317(1) & 35.210(1) \\ y=0.17 & 338.5(1) & 0.226(1) & 0.335(1) & 30.302(1) \\ y=0.76 & 338.0(1) & 0.204(1) & 0.404(1) & 17.406(1) \\ y=1.11 & 337.5(1) & 0.252(  presents a much smoother increase between 1.1 <= y <= 1.5.

If we can calculate the electronic polarization operator \Pi(\omega) for finite temperature and variable density of carriers, we shall be able to derive the relation between the carrier concentration and _r_(_o_), in an I/M regime where the transition from a Boltzmann to a Fermi gas of carriers may occur with increase of carrier concentration. This calculation involves the electronic damping g which is large in YBCO materials.40 To make it tractable, we make several simplifying assumptions. First, we consider the spectrum of carriers as purely two dimensional (2D) and isotropic. Second, the 2D density of single electronic states _v_(_e_) is considered as a constant _v_(_e_) = _v_(0). Finally, we shall only take into account elastic and quasielastic scattering of carriers, for which the energy change is small compared with _k__B__T_. Under these assumptions, _r_(_o_) = A  _Im_[_ln_(_o_)] reduces to41,42

\[\rho(\omega) = A\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\omega\gamma(\varepsilon)}{\omega^{2} +\gamma^{2}(\varepsilon)}[n(\varepsilon) - n(\varepsilon + \hat{n}_{0})]\nu(\varepsilon)d\varepsilon\]

. Along with the assumption of the energy-independent density of states, we assume also an energy-independent damping g. The integral over energy reduces to

\[\rho(\omega) = A\,\nu(0)\frac{\gamma\omega}{\omega^{2} + \gamma^{2}}\int_{0}^{\infty}[n(\varepsilon) - n(\varepsilon + \hat{n}_{0})]d\varepsilon\]

, where _g_(0) is the 2D electronic density of states equal to _m_*/_p_(_m_* is the effective mass) and g is the eigenvalue of the quasi-elastic collision integral corresponding to the fluctuations of the electron distribution functions excited by the phonon.

To evaluate this integral, we use the exact Fermi-Dirac distribution function, n(\varepsilon) = \{\exp[(\varepsilon - \mu)/k_{B}T] + 1\}^{- 1}, which is valid for arbitrary degeneracy of the electron gas. The chemical potential is related to the density of carriers as follows:

\[N_{\rm 2D} = \nu(0)\int_{0}^{\infty}\,\left[ \exp\left[ \frac{\varepsilon - \mu}{k_{B}T} \right] + 1 \right]^{- 1}d\varepsilon\]

N2D represents the free-carrier density of the Cu-O2 planes. Calculating the integrals (12) and (13) expressing m in terms of N2D, we get finally

\[\rho(\omega) = A\,\nu(0)\frac{\gamma\omega}{\omega^{2} + \gamma^{2}}\left[ \frac{N_{\rm 2D}}{\nu(0)} + \hat{n}_{0} - k_{B}T\ln\,\left[ e^{\frac{\omega_{\rm 2D}}{\nu(0)}k_{B}T} + e^{N_{\rm 2D}/\nu(0)k_{B}T} - 1\,\right]\,\right]\]

For o0 <= 340 cm-1 and T <= 300 K, we have \hat{n}_{0} \approx 1.7k_{B}T. When N2D ~= 0, _r_(_o_0) ~= 0 and when N2D >= _g_(0)_k__B__T_, _r_(_o_0) tends to the limit A\,\nu(0)\gamma\omega_{0}^{2}\hat{n}/(\gamma^{2} + \omega_{0}^{2}). In the framework of this calculation, _r

* [32]**A** sudden change had been reported (see Ref. 5) in the Raman phonon spectrum of the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} system at the L/M transition. Unfortunately, these results were in disagreement with the previous measurements (Refs. 1-4,6). We suspect that this drastic change in the Raman spectrum was originating from a phase other than the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}.
