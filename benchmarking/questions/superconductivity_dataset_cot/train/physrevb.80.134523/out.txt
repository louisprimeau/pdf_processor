###### Abstract

Heat capacity and anisotropic thermal expansion was measured for Fe_{1.06}Te and FeTe_{0.5}Se_{0.5} single crystals. Previously reported phase transitions are clearly seen in both measurements. In both cases the thermal expansion is anisotropic. The uniaxial pressure derivatives of the superconducting transition temperature in FeTe_{0.5}Se_{0.5} inferred from the Ehrenfest relation have opposite signs for in-plane and c-axis pressures. The Gruneisen parameters for both materials are similar and only weakly temperature dependent above \sim80 K.

The discovery of superconductivity in F-doped LaFeAsO (Ref. [1]) and K-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [2]) compounds caused an increased interest in studies of the materials containing Fe-As layers as a structural unit. More recently superconductivity was reported in two other structural families that have iron-pnictogen or iron-chalcogen layers in their structure, Li_{1-x}FeAs (Ref. [3]) and FeSe_{1-x}. [4] For the latter material, an enhancement of superconducting transition temperature, T_{c}, was observed upon substitution of S or Te for Se. [5] Recently, large single crystals of the Fe_{1+y}Te_{x}Se_{1-x} were grown and explored. [6]

Thermal expansion is professed to be uniquely sensitive to magnetic, structural, and superconducting transitions. [7] Anisotropic thermal expansion measurements in Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} (Refs. [8, 9, 10]) have been instrumental in inferring unusually large, anisotropic, uniaxial pressure derivatives of superconducting transition temperature, T_{c}, in these compounds. Gruneisen parameter analysis on the other hand is frequently used for comparative, thermodynamic studies of related materials. [11] To gain more understanding about the members of the Fe_{1+y}Te_{x}Se_{1-x} family, in this work we present the measurements of heat capacity and anisotropic thermal expansion on its two members: nonsuperconducting, parent compound, Fe_{1.06}Te, and, close to optimally doped, superconducting, FeTe_{0.5}Se_{0.5}.

Single crystals of Fe_{1.06}Te and FeTe_{0.5}Se_{0.5} were grown by Bridgeman technique. Detailed description of the crystallographic procedure and compositional analysis for these samples can be found elsewhere. [6] The heat capacity of the samples was measured using a hybrid adiabatic relaxation technique of the heat capacity option in a Quantum Design, PPMS-14 instrument. Thermal expansion data were obtained using a capacitive dilatometer constructed of OFHC copper; a detailed description of the dilatometer is presented elsewhere. [12] The dilatometer was mounted in a Quantum Design PPMS-14 instrument and was operated over a temperature range of 1.8 to 305 K. The samples were cut and lightly (and carefully) polished so as to have parallel surfaces parallel and perpendicular to the c direction with the distances L between the surfaces ranging between approximately 0.3-1.4 mm. Specific heat and thermal expansion data were taken on warming and on the same samples. Having in mind the softness and somewhat micaceous morphology of the samples as well rather small changes in thermal expansion coefficients at the superconducting transitions for the FeTe_{0.5}Se_{0.5} crystal (see below), the error bars for the estimates of the uniaxial pressure derivatives of the superconducting transition temperature may be as high as \sim30%, that still allows for a semiquantitative analysis of the results.

Thermodynamic properties of materials are frequently analyzed using the concept of a Gruneisen function (or a Gruneisen parameter). [11] For a single energy scale, \varepsilon, the Gruneisen parameter, \gamma, is defined as \gamma=d\ln\varepsilon/d\ln V, where V is a molar volume. Using thermodynamic relations, we can obtain \gamma(T,V)=\beta V/\chi_{S}C_{p}, where \beta is a volume thermal expansion coefficient [\beta=(\partial\ln V/\partial T)_{p}], \chi_{S} is an adiabatic compressibility [\chi_{S}=-(\partial\ln V/\partial P)_{S}] and C_{p} is a heat capacity at a constant pressure. If, as in many modern materials of interest, more than one contribution to the thermodynamic properties is present (e.g., vibrational, electronic, magnetic, etc.), the Gruneisen parameters are not additive, rather the Gruneisen parameter for the material is an average, weighted by the heat capacity contribution of each component: [11]\gamma=\Sigma_{r}\gamma_{c},C_{r}/\Sigma_{r}C_{r}. Even with such complexity, the Gruneisen parameter behavior in many cases still allows for some qualitative conclusions.

Sometimes, in the analysis of experimental data, lacking the temperature-dependent compressibility data, the temperature dependence of the Gruneisen parameter can be approximated [13] as being proportional to \beta/C_{p} under the assumption that the relative temperature dependence of \chi_{S} is significantly smaller then that of thermal expansion coefficient or heat capacity. We will follow such approach in this work.

The temperature-dependent heat capacity data for the Fe_{1.06}Te crystal are shown in Fig. 1. A narrow, sharp peak is clearly seen at \sim68 K. The electronic specific heat coefficient is estimated as \gamma= 34 mJ/mol K2. These data are very similar to those reported for Fe_{1.05}Te in Ref. [14]. The transition (in Fe_{1.068}Te) was identified [16] as being first order, structural (high-temperature tetragonal to low-temperature monoclinic), and antiferromagnetic. The temperature-depending anisotropic thermal expansivities and thermal expansion coefficients for Fe_{1.06}Te are shown in Fig. 2. The thermal expansion coefficients are less anisotropic than in BaFe_{2}As_{2}. [8] The c-axis thermal expansion coefficient is positive and al  most temperature independent above the transition and small, negative, weakly temperature-dependent below the transition. The transition is seen as a sharp feature in each of the measurements. The length in the _ab_ plane decreases, in relative terms, by =4.4 x 10-3 on cooling through the transition. The change along the c axis is smaller and of the opposite sign: the relative increase along the c axis is =9 x 10-4. We note, however, that the "bulk" thermal expansion measurements yield an average (of some intermediate value) thermal expansion and are not sensitive to possible change in structural symmetry in different phases. Moreover, in the current measurements the exact in-plane direction was not defined. The thermal expansivities are in remarkable agreement with those measured by neutron powder diffraction for Fe1.076Te in Ref. [15] (Fig. 2). The change at the transition in the c axis is very close to the value reported by neutron scattering (between 80 and 5 K), [16] Our in-plane data are within the range of that from neutron scattering, [16] but not the same as reported change in either a or b lattice parameter, that is not surprising considering that our measurements were done for arbitrary in-plane orientation and that there is a possibility of in-plane structural domains below the structural/magnetic transition that will cause some average, intermediate, value to be measured by "bulk" dilatometric techniques.

The temperature-dependent heat capacity for FeTe0.5Se0.5 crystal is shown in Fig. 3. A feature associated with a superconducting transition (with an onset T_{c}^{onset} = 14 K) is clear in the data. Thermal expansion of the FeTe0.5Se0.5 crystal (Fig. 4) is more anisotropic than that of Fe1.06Te. The in-plane thermal expansion is negative below ~120 K. The features at the superconducting transition are seen in both directions and the changes in the thermal expansion at _Tc_ are of the opposite sign in the in-plane and _c_-axis data sets.

The initial uniaxial pressure derivatives of _Tc_ can be estimated using the Ehrenfest relation for the second order phase transitions: [11]

\[dT_{c}/dp_{i} = \frac{V_{m}\Delta\alpha_{i}}{\Delta C_{p}/T_{c}},\]

where _Vm_ is the molar volume, D_a__i_ is a change in the linear (_i=ab,c_) thermal expansion coefficient at the superconducting transition, and D_C__p_/_Tc_ is a change in the specific heat at the superconducting transition divided by _Tc_. Using experi

  mental values: V_{m}=0.26\times10^{-4} m^{3}/mol,^{6}\Delta\alpha_{ab}\approx-1.8 \times10^{-6} K^{-1}, \Delta\alpha_{c}\approx 0.8\times10^{-6} K^{-1}, and \Delta C_{p}/T_{c}\approx 13.4 mJ/mol K^{2}, we can estimate initial uniaxial pressure derivatives of the superconducting transition temperature in FeTe_{0.5}Se_{0.5}: dT_{c}/dp_{ab}\approx-0.35 K/kbar and dT_{c}/dp_{c}\approx 0.16 K/kbar. This rough estimate of the hydrostatic pressure derivative of T_{c} is then dT_{c}/dP\approx 2\cdotdT_{c}/dp_{ab}+dT_{c}/dp_{c}=-0.54 K/kbar. So in-plane pressure should cause a decrease in T_{c} and pressure along the c axis is expected to cause an increase in T_{c}. The signs of the inferred uniaxial pressure derivatives are the same as for "underdoped" Ba(Fe_{0.962}Co_{0.038})_{2}As_{2},^{8} but the absolute values are more moderate; about an order of magnitude smaller.

The temperature-dependent Gruneisen parameters, in the form of \beta^{\prime}C_{p}, (volume thermal expansion, \beta, is defined here as \beta=2\cdot\alpha_{ab}+\alpha_{c}) for Fe_{1.06}Te and FeTe_{0.5}Se_{0.5} are shown in Fig. 5. (The excessive noise below \sim5 K could be caused by the division by small C_{p} values.) For FeTe_{0.5}Se_{0.5} the \beta/C_{p} is practically temperature-independent above \sim15 K. For Fe_{1.06}Te the value of \beta/C_{p} at temperatures above the structural/magnetic phase transition is very close to that of FeTe_{0.5}Se_{0.5}, however, below the transition the Gruneisen parameter of Fe_{1.06}Te is significantly higher, and, close to the transition is only weakly temperature dependent. Most probably this difference is due to the magnetic contribution (the heat capacity and the inferred Debye temperature are continuous if the region around transition is excluded, so probably the change in the phonon term is not so drastic through the transition), however, other contributions, such as domain formation accompanying the structural transitions, cannot be excluded, and more studies are required to clarify this issue.

In summary, thermal expansion of Fe_{1.06}Te and FeTe_{0.5}Se_{0.5} is anisotropic, phase transitions are clearly seen. The signs of the inferred uniaxial pressure derivatives of T_{c} in FeTe_{0.5}Se_{0.5} are opposite for in-plain (dT_{c}/dp_{ab}<0) and c-axis (dT_{c}/dp_{c}> 0) pressures. The Gruneisen parameters for both materials are similar and only weakly temperature dependent above \sim80 K. At low temperatures (in the magnetically ordered phase) the magnetic contribution to the Gruneisen parameter in Fe_{1.06}Te appears to be significantly larger than electron and phonon contributions combined.
