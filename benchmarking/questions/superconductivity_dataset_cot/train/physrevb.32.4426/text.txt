  shown in Fig. 1. The crystal structure consists of three interpenetrating face-centered-cubic lattices. The rare earth occupies a site of cubic symmetry. An internal standard was used in x-ray-diffraction studies to obtain accurate lattice parameters which are listed in Table 1. The lattice parameter changes in a linear way between any two end members, which is expected for a tight-bound fcc lattice.

Superconducting transition temperatures were measured down to 1.2 K using an ac bridge operating at 900 Hz. In some cases the four probe ac resistive technique was used. The \(T_{e}\) values reported here are defined as 50% of the total transition. Typical transition widths were of the order of 0.2 K.

## III Results and Discussion

The results of the \(T_{e}\) measurements along with the lattice parameters for the compounds Pd2Y1-_x_R_sSn for various \(R\) and \(x\) are given in Table 1. Figure 2 shows the plot of \(T_{e}\) versus \(x\) on these compounds. The \(T_{e}\) drops rapidly with the addition of Gd; the compound with 10% Gd is not superconducting down to 1.2 K. The depression in \(T_{e}\) becomes successively smaller for the same value of \(x\) in going from Gd to Er. However, the depression is less pronounced for Tm and Yb substitutions because, in this case, the end members Pd2TmSn and Pd2YbSn are themselves superconducting. The depression in \(T_{e}\) is almost linear in \(x\) for all the rare-earth metals with some scatter of data. In some cases the superconducting transition temperature was found to be sample dependent.

The exchange interaction between the conduction electron spin **s** and the 4\(f\) (or the rare-earth) spin **S**, which is responsible for the pair breaking, is given by the Hamiltonian

\[{\cal K} = - 2J_{sf}{\bf S} \cdot {\bf s}\ ,\]

where \(J_{sf}\) is the exchange constant for the above interaction. The theory for the effect of paramagnetic impurities, such as the rare earths with unfilled 4\(f\) shells, on superconductivity was given to second order in \(J_{sf}\) by Abrikosov and Gor'kov (AG).7 Qualitatively, one may understand the effect of magnetic impurities in terms of the pair breaking. The exchange interaction given by Eq. (1) has the effect of breaking Cooper pairs by acting differently on the two paired electrons. According to AG theory, in the presence of randomly oriented magnetic impurities, and isotropic exchange interaction, the superconducting transition temperature is given by the following expression:

\[\ln (T_{e}/T_{e0}) = \psi({\frac{1}{2}}) - \psi[{\frac{1}{2}} + (2\pi T_{e}\tau_{s})^{- 1}]\ ,\]

with

\[\tau_{s}^{- 1} = 2\pi n_{I}N(0)J_{sf}^{2}(g_{J} - 1)^{2}J(J + 1)\ ,\]

where \(n_{I}\) is the concentration of impurity rare-earth ions, \(T_{e0}\) is the transition temperature in the absence of magnetic impurities (i.e., \(n_{I} = 0\)), \(\psi\) is the digamma function, \(N(0)\) is the density of states at the Fermi level per atom per spin direction, \(g_{J}\) is the Lande' \(g\) factor of the impurity rare-earth ion and \(J\) its total angular momentum.

According to the AG theory, for small concentration \(n_{I}\) of magnetic impurities, \(T_{e}\) decreases linearly with \(n_{I}\) and the initial rate of depression of \(T_{e}\), (\(dT_{e}/dn_{I}\)), is given by the equation

  \[\frac{dT_{e}}{dn_{I}}\left|{}_{n_{I}\to 0}\right. = 4\frac{dT_{e}}{dx}\left|{}_{x\to 0}\right.\] (4) \[= -\frac{\pi^{2}N(0)J_{sf}^{2}(g_{J}-1)^{2}J(J+1)}{2k_{B}}\ .\]

[For Heusler alloys with four atoms per unit cell we define \(dT_{e}/dx\!=\!(\frac{\tau}{4})\,dT_{e}/dn_{I}\) where \(x\) is the fraction of rare-earth atoms in the Pd2Y1-_x_R_xSn]. The rate of depression of \(T_{e}\) with concentration (\(dT_{e}/dx\)) in Pd2Y1-_x_R_xSn series as a function of rare-earth ion is plotted in Fig. 3. The observed \(dT_{e}/dx\) is found to deviate from the de Gennes factor [8] (\(g_{J}\!-\!1)^{2}J(J\!+\!1)\) as given by Eq. (4). The expected behavior of \(dT_{e}/dx\) according to AG theory is shown by a dashed line in Fig. 3 after normalizing to the value in Gd. The observed data points, except for Yb, lie below the expected line in general. This may be due to the fact that either \(N(0)\) or \(J_{sf}\) or both may be slightly changing across the series or due to crystal-field effects. Similar behavior has been observed in the study of magnetic rare-earth substitution in superconducting LuRh4B4 and LaAl2.[9] The anomalous behavior of Yb has been attributed to the negative sign of \(J_{sf}\) due to strong hybridization of conduction-electron states with \(4f\) states.[10] Using the experimental value of \(dT_{e}/dx\!=\!-44\) K/atom fraction of Gd substitution in Pd2YSn, we obtain from Eq. (4) a value of \(1.83\!\times\!10^{-4}\) eV for \(N(0)J_{sf}^{2}\). Since the band structure and hence the density of states is not known in these alloys, exact values of \(J_{sf}\) cannot be obtained at present. However, if we take a typical value of \(N(0)\!=\!0.3\) states/eV atom spin in Pd2YSn we get \(|J_{sf}|=\!0.025\) eV.

We have also analyzed the complete dependence of \(T_{e}\) on \(x\) in Pd2Y1-_x_R_xSn for various rare earths in terms of AG theory taking into account the effects due to the CEF. As remarked earlier, the CEF effects have been found to be appreciable in Pd2TmSn and Pd2YbSn, the two compounds which have been investigated in detail from susceptibility and/or heat-capacity measurements.[3, 4] The crystal-field parameters for these two compounds have been estimated and are consistent with each other in

\[\overline{\ln\left(\frac{T_{e}}{T_{e0}}\right)}\ =-\sum_{i,j}\frac{\pi p_{j}}{8T_{e}\tau_{ij}^{*}}\left[1+\frac{\tanh\!x}{x}-\tanh\!x+\frac{B(x)\!-\!A(x)}{\tanh\!x}\right]\ ,\] (5)

where \(x\!=\!(\delta_{ij}/2T_{e})\); \(\delta_{ij}\!=\!(E_{i}\!-\!E_{j})\) is the energy separation between the two crystal-field-split levels \(|i\rangle\) and \(|j\rangle\),

The dotted line is based on de Gennes function after renormalizing to the value for Gd. The solid line is based on AG theory with the inclusion of crystalline electric field effects and with \(N(0)J_{sf}^{2}\!=\!1.83\!\times\!10^{-4}\) eV, the value derived for the Gd substituted system.

  \[p_{j} = \exp( - E_{j}/k_{B}T)/\sum\limits_{j}\exp( - E_{j}/k_{B}T)\]

and

\[(\tau_{ij}^{q} )^{ - 1} = 2\pi n_{I}N(0)(g_{J} - 1)^{2}\mid\langle i\mid{\bf J}\mid j\rangle\mid^{2}.\]

and the functions \(A(x)\) and \(B(x)\) have the same meaning as in Ref. 13 [Eqs. (59) and (60), respectively].

The initial depression of \(T_{e}\) in the presence of CEF interaction is given by

\[\left. \frac{dT_{e}}{dn_{I}} \right|_{n_{I} \to 0} = - \frac{\pi^{2}N(0)J_{sf}^{2}(g_{J} - 1)^{2}}{4k_{B}}\sum\limits_{i,j}p_{j}\mid\langle i\mid{\bf J}\mid j\rangle\mid^{2}\left[ 1 + \frac{\tanh\!x}{x} - \tanh\!x+\frac{B(x) - A(x)}{\tanh\!x} \right].\]

Keller and Fulde have given the exact expressions for the \(T_{e}\) for any arbitrary concentration of magnetic impurity and have also shown that for \(T_{e}/T_{e0}\) not too small, the effect of CEF interaction can be approximated by replacing the temperature independent pair-breaking term in Eq. (2) by the temperature-dependent pair-breaking term involving the effects due to CEF. In order to do this one may replace \(\tau_{s}^{ - 1}\) in Eq. (2) by its temperature-dependent analogue given by

\[\tau_{s}^{ - 1} = \pi n_{I}N(0)J_{sf}^{2}(g_{J} - 1)^{2}\sum\limits_{i,j}p_{j}\mid\langle i\mid{\bf J}\mid j\rangle\mid^{2}\left[ 1 + \frac{\tanh\!x}{x} - \tanh\!x+\frac{B(x) - A(x)}{\tanh\!x} \right].\]

Note that in the absence of any CEF interaction \(x = 0.0\), \(p_{j} = 1/(2J + 1)\), the term in square brackets in Eqs. (6) and (7) becomes unity, and

\[\sum\limits_{i,j}p_{j}\mid\langle i\mid{\bf J}\mid j\rangle\mid^{2} = 2J(J + 1)\]

and Eqs. (6) and (7) reduce to the corresponding Eqs. (4) and (2) in the absence of CEF effects.

We have numerically calculated \(T_{e}\)'s using this theory and the CEF parameters given in Table 2. The initial suppression of \(T_{e}\) with the inclusion of CEF effects and assuming \(N(0)J_{sf}^{2}\) to be the same as in the Gd substituted compounds, is shown as a solid line in Fig. 3. This curve is somewhat closer to the experimental values than the curve given by the de Gennes factors. The solid lines in Fig. 2 are the best-fitted lines to the complete data with \(N(0)J_{sf}^{2}\) as an independent parameter. The differences from the AG theory are not very pronounced if the ground state is a Kramer's doublet or more generally a degenerate magnetic state. The values of \(N(0)J_{sf}^{2}\) so obtained are listed in Table 3. It is noted that the \(N(0)J_{sf}^{2}\) shows some dependence on the rare-earth ion involved. It may be remarked that the compound Pd\({}_{2}\)DySn undergoes a structural transformation [14] at low temperatures to a phase of lower than cubic symmetry. It is assumed that the small addition of Dy does not cause a structural transition in Pd\({}_{2}\)Y\({}_{1 - x}\) DySn compounds.

Considerable deviation in the \(N(0)J_{sf}^{2}\) values is observed in the Yb compound and to some extent in the Tm compound compared to the values in other Pd\({}_{2}\)Y\({}_{1 - x}R_{x}\)Sn compounds. Part of this may be due to the fact that the \(T_{e0}\) may be concentration dependent and some suppression may occur due to nonmagnetic effects. This can be seen by plotting the \(T_{e}\) of Pd\({}_{2}\)RSn compounds as a function of lattice parameter (Fig. 4) for nonmagnetic \(R = \)Sc, Y, and Lu. \(T_{e}\) is found to vary from 2.05 K for Pd\({}_{2}\)ScSn to 4.55 K for Pd\({}_{2}\)YSn, although all the rare-earth ions involved are nonmagnetic. One may have to take into account such dependence of \(T_{e}\) on the lattice parameter. This does not cause much of a problem in dilute alloys of Gd, Dy, Ho, and Er because \(T_{e}\) is suppressed very rapidly due to magnetic impurities while the lattice parameter remains essentially unchanged. However, for Tm and Yb compounds there is a large change in the lattice parameters. In order to take this into consideration we have also performed calculations by defining a different \(T_{e0}\) for each concentration of Tm and Yb. The \(T_{e0}\)'s corresponding to the lattice parameters of these compounds are taken

The error based on experimental results is \(\pm 20\%\).

  from Fig. 4. This is an assumption and certainly all the change in \(T_{\bf c0}\) is not due to changes in the lattice parameters alone. In any case this procedure has the effect of reducing \(N(0)J_{sf}^{2}\) causing some discrepancy in the value for Tm compound but acting in the right direction for the Yb compound. The values of \(N(0)J_{sf}^{2}\) so obtained are given in Table 3. As remarked earlier, the somewhat larger value of \(N(0)J_{sf}^{2}\) in the Yb compound may be due to the presence of a Kondo-type interaction. We find that to reproduce the \(T_{e}\) values of Pd\({}_{2}\)TmSn and Pd\({}_{2}\)YbSn with CEF effects and with \(N(0)J_{sf}^{2}\)\(=\) 1.83\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) eV, we need \(T_{e0}\) values of 4.43 K and 3.35 K, respectively. We would like to suggest that pressure-dependent investigations on these systems may help resolve some of the above questions.

The values of \(N(0)J_{sf}^{2}\) in Pd\({}_{2}\)Y\({}_{1-x}R_{x}\)Sn obtained from the present studies are comparable in magnitude to those in \(RR_{\bf h}\)B\({}_{4}\) series of compounds[5] and somewhat larger than those estimated in Chevrel-phase compounds[6]\(R\)Mo\({}_{6}\)S\({}_{8}\). With only four atoms in the unit cell of the Heusler structure, the superconducting \(T_{e}\) is depressed very rapidly with the addition of magnetic rare earths and hence no superconductivity is observed in the magnetic rare-earth compounds of this series except for Tm and Yb compounds. It has been shown that the crystalline electric fields are appreciable in Pd\({}_{2}\)TmSn and Pd\({}_{2}\)YbSn. As a result of the lifting of the degeneracy of the ground \(J\) manifold by CEF, the ground state is either a nonmagnetic doublet or a triplet in the case of Tm\({}^{3+}\). The ground state of a Yb\({}^{3+}\) ion is a magnetic doublet \(\Gamma_{7}\) but with the moment considerably reduced from its free-ion value. Therefore, in spite of the large value of \(N(0)J_{sf}^{2}\), the superconducting state in Tm and Yb compounds is not suppressed.

In conclusion, the depression of the superconducting transition temperature of a new rare earth containing Heusler alloy Pd\({}_{2}\)YSn has been investigated as a function of the concentration of magnetic rare-earth ions substituted in place of Y. Deviations from the de Gennes\(-\)type behavior are observed in the initial suppression of \(T_{e}\). The results have been analyzed on the basis of AG theory taking into account the CEF effects. The values of the density of states times the exchange constant, \([N(0)J_{sf}^{2}]\), for exchange interaction between conduction-electron spins and rare-earth spins have been estimated.
