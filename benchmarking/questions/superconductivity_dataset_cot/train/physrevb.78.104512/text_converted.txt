###### Abstract

Single crystals of BaRh₂As₂ have been synthesized from a Pb flux. We
present the room-temperature crystal structure, single-crystal x-ray
diffraction measurements as a function of temperature T, anisotropic
magnetic susceptibility χ versus T, electrical resistivity in the _ab_
plane ρ versus T, Hall coefficient versus T and magnetic field H, and
heat capacity C versus T measurements on the crystals. The
single-crystal structure determination confirms that BaRh₂As₂ forms in
the tetragonal ThCr₃Si₂-type structure (space group I4/_mmm_) with
lattice parameters _a=b_=4.0564(6) A and _c_=12.797(4) A. Band-structure
calculations show that BaRh₂As₂ should be metallic with a small density
of states at the Fermi energy N(E_(F)) =3.49 states/eV f.u. (where f.u.
= formula unit) for both spin directions. _p_(_T_) data in the _ab_
plane confirm that the material is indeed metallic with a residual
resistivity _p_(2 K) =29 μΩ cm and with a residual resistivity ratio
_p_(310 K)/_p_(2 K) =5.3. The observed χ(T) is small (∼10⁻⁵ cm³/mol) and
weakly anisotropic with _Xab_/_Xc_ 2. The _C_(_T_) data indicate a small
density of states at the Fermi energy with the low-temperature
Sommerfeld coefficient γ =4.7(9) mJ/mol K². There are no indications of
superconductivity, spin-density wave, or structural transitions between
2 and 300 K. We compare the calculated density of states versus energy
of BaRh₂As₂ with that of BaFe₂As₂.

## I Introduction

The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in
LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) with _T_(c)_ =26 K (Ref. [1]) has generated a lot
of activity in the search for related superconductors. Even higher
_T_(c)_’s of 35 to 55 K have been achieved when Lu is replaced by other
rare-earth elements R = Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, and Dy.[2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8] These materials form in the tetragonal ZrCuSiAs-type structure
(_P_4/_mmm_).[9] The structure is made up of FeAs layers alternated by
LaO layers stacked along the c axis. The undoped materials _R_FeAsO show
a spin-density wave (SDW) transition and a coupled structural transition
at high temperatures (_T_ ∼ 150 K).[3, 10, 11] On doping with F, the SDW
and the structural transitions are suppressed and superconductivity is
observed.[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12]

Recently a different family of compounds _A_Fe₂As₂ (_A_ = Ba, Sr, Ca,
and Eu) was discovered, which crystallize in the tetragonal
ThCr₂Si₂-type structure and has similar FeAs layers separated by A
layers stacked along the c axis. Similar to the _R_FeAsO materials,
these materials also show SDW and structural transitions at high
temperatures.[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] When the A atoms
are partially replaced by K, Na, or Cs, the SDW and structural
transitions are suppressed and superconductivity is observed.[23, 24,
25, 26] The common feature in all the materials mentioned above is the
FeAs layer in their crystal structure. It is of interest to look for
other materials with related structures and investigate their physical
properties to see if these can be potential parent compounds for
high-temperature superconductors.

The series of compounds _A_Rh₂As₂ (_A_ = Ba, Sr, and Eu) were previously
synthesized in single-crystal form and their crystal structure was
reported.[27] The Ba and Eu compounds form in the ThCr₂Si₂-type
structure while the Sr compound forms in a different structure. The
crystal structure of BaRh₂As₂ is shown in Fig. 1. The structure is built
up of RhAs layers alternated by Ba layers stacked along the
crystallographic c axis. Within the RhAs layers, the As atoms lie
outside the plane, which is formed by the Rh atoms. To the best of our
knowledge, the physical properties of these _A_Rh₂As₂ compounds have not
been investigated before.

Herein we report on the crystal-growth, single-crystal structure
resistivity ρ in the _ab_ plane versus temperature T, Hall effect versus
T and magnetic field H, magnetic susceptibility χ versus T, and heat
capacity C versus T measurements of BaRh₂As₂. Our experimental results
are compared

RhAs alternate along the c axis. Within the RhAs layers, the As atoms
lie outside the plane formed by the square-lattice Rh atoms.

with predictions of band-structure calculations.

## II Experimental Details

Single crystals of BaRh₂As₂ were grown out of Pb flux.[27] The elements
were taken in the ratio Ba:Rh:As:Pb = 1.1:2:2.1:50, placed in an alumina
crucible, and were then sealed in a quartz tube under vacuum (10⁻³
mbar). The whole assembly was placed in a box furnace and heated to 1000
^(∘)C at a rate of 50 ^(∘)C/hr, left there for 10 h, and then cooled to
500 ^(∘)C at a rate of 5 ^(∘)C/hr. At this temperature the molten Pb
flux was decanted. Shiny platelike crystals of typical size 1.5× 1.5×
0.1 mm³ were obtained. The composition of a crystal was checked using
energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) semiquantitative analysis using a JEOL
scanning electron microscope (SEM). The SEM scans were taken on a
cleaved surface of the crystal. The EDX gave the average elemental ratio
Ba:Rh:As=20.4:40.8:38.8, which is consistent with an approximate 1:2:2
stoichiometry for the compound. A SEM image of a typical as-grown
crystal is shown in Fig. 2(a). Laue back-scattering measurements on the
crystals showed that the largest surface of the plates was perpendicular
to the c axis. For crystal structure determination, single-crystal x-ray
diffraction measurements were done at temperature T = 293 K using a
Bruker CCD-1000 diffractometer with Mo _Kα_ (λ = 0.71073 A) radiation.
To look for structural phase transitions, single-crystal x-ray
diffraction measurements were performed on a standard four-circle
diffractometer using Cu _Kα_ radiation from a rotating anode x-ray
source, selected by a Ge(111) monochromator. For these measurements, a
platelike single crystal with dimensions of 2× 1.5× 0.2 mm³ was
selected. The sample was mounted on a flat copper sample holder in a
closed cycle display cryogenic refrigerator with the (001)-(110)
reciprocal-lattice plane coincident with the scattering plane. The
diffraction patterns were recorded for temperatures between 10 and 300 K
and with a setup optimized for high resolution in transverse scans in
the scattering plane. The measured mosaicity of this crystal was
0.025^(∘) full width half maximum for both the (0010) and (1110)
reflections at room temperature as shown in Fig. 2(b), indicating the
good quality of the single crystal.

The _kh_(_T_) was measured on a collection of aligned crystals with a
total mass of 5.11 mg using a commercial superconducting quantum
interference device magnetometer (MPMS5, Quantum Design); the standard
four-probe ρ(T) was measured with a current of amplitude I = 2 mA at a
frequency of 16 Hz, using the ac transport option of a commercial
physical property measurement system (PPMS5, Quantum Design). The
contacts were made with silver epoxy on a cleaved surface of a crystal.
The current I = 2 mA was applied in the _ab_ plane. The C(_T_) was
measured on a collection of three crystals with a total mass of 3.2 mg
using the commercial PPMS.

For the density of states (DOS) calculations, we have used the full
potential linearized augmented plane-wave method with a local-density
approximation functional.[28] The difference in energy of 0.01 mRy/cell
between successive iterations was used as a convergence criterion. The
value of _R_MT$K_{\rm max}$ [the smallest muffin-tin (MT) radius
multiplied by the maximum k value in the expansion of plane waves in the
basis set], which determines the accuracy of the basis set used, is set
to 9.0. The total Brillouin zone was sampled with 405 k points in the
irreducible Brillouin zone. The employed MT radii are 2.4, 2.2, and 2.2
atomic units for Ba, Rh, and As, respectively. The structural data
(lattice constants and atomic positions) were taken from the previously
reported single-crystal structure of BaRh₂As₂.[27]

## III Results

### Single crystal x-ray diffraction and structure of BaRh₂As₂

A small (0.35× 0.35× 0.07 mm³) platelike single crystal was used for
crystal structure determination. The initial cell parameters were taken
as those previously reported for BaRh₂As₂ (ThCr₂Si₂ structure, Z = 2
formula units/unit cell, and space group I4/_mmm_).[27] The final cell
parameters and atomic positions were calculated from a set of 861 strong
reflections with good profiles in the range 2θ=6^(∘) -61^(∘). The
unit-cell parameters were found to be a = b = 4.0564(6) A and c =
12.797(4) A. These values are in good agreement

as-grown crystal of BaRh₂As₂. The white mottled area on the surface is a

with previously reported values for single crystalline BaRh₂As₂
[a = b = 4.053(1) A, and c = 12.770(3) A].[27] There is only one atomic
coordinate not constrained by symmetry requirements: the z position for
As. Our value of z =0.3566(3) is also in good agreement with
z = 0.3569(1), which is reported previously by the full single-crystal
refinement.[27] The single crystals of BaRh₂As₂ have a high tendency to
split/cleave into very thin plates perpendicular to the c axis resulting
in significant mosaicity/twinning. This resulted in some reflections to
be broad/extended. This, and the unfavorable aspect ratio of the crystal
for the appropriate absorption correction, did not allow a full
refinement of the structure with a reasonable R factor.

Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the results of our temperature dependent
single-crystal x-ray diffraction measurements, which were done to check
for the possibility of a structural phase transition in BaRh₂As₂. Figure
3(a) shows the longitudinal (00χ) scans through the (0010) reflection at
various temperatures between 10 and 300 K relative to the alignment at
T=200 K. We did not observe any change in the shape of the (0010)
reflection as a function of temperature. The change in the position of
the peak results mainly from lattice parameter changes between different
temperatures. The small peak at the shoulder of the (0010) reflection at
low temperatures [Fig. 3(a)] arises from a second grain with a slightly
different orientation. In contrast to the isostructural compounds
AFe₂As₂ ($A\!=\!{\rm Ba,Sr,Ca}$),[15, 16, 17] transverse (ξξ0) scans
through the (1 1 10) reflection [Fig. 3(b)] show no splitting and/or
abrupt changes in reflection position over the temperature range between
10 and 300 K, indicating the absence of the structural transition
reported for the isostructural AFe₂As₂ ($A\!=\!{\rm Ba,Sr,Ca}$)
compounds.[15, 16, 17] This is consistent with the macroscopic
measurements that will be discussed later.

### Density of states

The calculated total DOS N(E_(F)) for BaRh₂As₂ for both spin directions
versus energy E measured relative to the Fermi energy E_(F) is shown in
Fig. 4(a). We calculate N(E_(F)) =3.49 states/eV f.u. (f.u. =formula
unit) for both spin directions for BaRh₂As₂. Figure 4(b) shows the
partial DOS for the individual atoms. The maximum contribution to the
total N(E_(F)) is from the Rh 4d states with small but significant
contributions from Ba and As. Since rather small MT radii were employed,
wave functions for the 4d Rh states extend out into the interstitial
region. This results in a significant DOS in the interstitial region,
which is not accounted for in the partial DOS estimates. This
interstitial DOS is however accounted for in calculation of the total
DOS. Therefore, the partial DOS shown in Fig. 4(b) do not add up to the
total DOS shown in Fig. 4(a). It is of interest to compare the DOS
versus energy for BaRh₂As₂ with that of

Figure 4: (Color online) (a) The total density of states for both spin
directions for BaRh₂As₂. (b) Partial density of states of Ba, Rh, and As
atoms in BaRh₂As₂.

0 10) reflection for selected temperatures. The offset between each data
set is 1000 counts/s. (b) Transverse (ξξω) scans through the position of
the (1 1 10) reflection for selected temperatures. The offset between
each data set is 500 counts/s. In (a) and (b), the horizontal axes
represent the scattering vectors relative to the alignment at T=200 K to
illustrate the temperature dependence of the reflection positions.

BaFe₂As₂. Figure 5 shows the total DOS for both spin directions for
BaRh₂As₂ (solid curve) and BaFe₂As₂ (dashed curve). The band structures
for the two materials are seen to be qualitatively quite similar. It
appears that the bands for BaRh₂As₂ are shifted down (and stretched) in
energy relative to the bands for BaFe₂As₂. For BaFe₂As₂, if the Fermi
energy E_(F) moves down by about 0.5 eV on hole doping, there is a large
increase in the DOS (almost 4-5 times) compared to the parent compound.
To move the E_(F) for the BaRh₂As₂ material to the corresponding band
located at about 2 eV below E_(F) would evidently require a much larger
amount of doping.

### Magnetic susceptibility

The magnetic susceptibilities for BaRh₂As₂ measured with an applied
magnetic field H=2 T parallel to the c axis χ_(c)(T) and with H parallel
to the ab plane χ_(ab)(T) are shown in Fig. 6 (after correcting for
contributions from the sample holder). The measurements were made on a
collection of four c-axis aligned crystals with a total mass of 5.11 mg.
Both χ_(c)(T) and χ_(ab)(T) are almost temperature independent and have
very small average values χ_(c)(T)=1.5 × 10⁻⁵ cm³/mol and χ_(ab)(T)=3×
10⁻⁵ cm³/mol. There is a small anisotropy in the whole temperature range
with χ_(ab)/χ_(c)=2. The data are somewhat noisy, most likely due to
both the small absolute values of the susceptibility and the small
crystal mass used for the measurements. The powder averaged
susceptibility χ(T) can be calculated for a tetragonal system as

$$\chi=\frac{2\chi_{ab}+\chi_{c}}{3}.$$
(1)

From the average values of χ_(ab) and χ_(c), we estimate an average
value χ=2.5× 10⁻⁵ cm³/mol from 10 to 300 K.

The susceptibility χ(T) can be written as

$$\chi=\chi_{\rm core}+\chi_{L}+\chi_{\rm VV}+\chi_{P},$$
(2)

where $\chi_{\rm core}$ is the diamagnetic orbital contribution from the
localized core electrons (ionic or atomic), χ_(L) is the Landau orbital
diamagnetism of the conduction electrons, $\chi_{\rm VV}$ is the Van
Vleck paramagnetic orbital contribution, and χ_(P) is the Pauli
paramagnetic spin susceptibility of the conduction electrons. We
evaluated χ_(P) and $\chi_{\rm VV}$ from electronic structure
calculations using [29]

χ_(P) = μ_(B)²N(E_(F)),
(3)

where μ_(B) is the Bohr magneton and N(E_(F)) is the bare density of
states at the Fermi level for both spin directions, and

$$\chi_{\rm VV}=\mu_{B}^{2}\sum_{n,n^{\prime},\vec{k}}\frac{\int_{E_{F}(-1)- \chi_{c}(-1)}}{E_{n}e_{n}e_{n^{\prime}}}|\langle n\vec{k}||L_{z}|n^{\prime} \vec{k}\rangle|,$$
(4)

where f is the Fermi-Dirac distribution function and L_(z) is the z
component of the angular-momentum operator. [29] We have calculated the
anisotropic $\chi_{\rm VV}$ for magnetic field H in the (001) and (110)
directions.

The diamagnetic contribution χ_(D)=$\chi_{\rm core}$+χ_(L) to the total
susceptibility was also estimated. Since diamagnetic susceptibility is
problematic to calculate in extended systems because of intercell
currents, we take the value from calculations of the neutral atoms and
ignore the solid-state effects. This gives a lower limit estimate of
χ_(D). It also misses any anisotropy arising from intercell currents.

The results of these calculations are summarized in Table 1. It can be
seen that although the individual contributions χ_(P), χ_(D), and
$\chi_{\rm VV}$ are large there is a large cancellation between the
positive χ_(P) and $\chi_{\rm VV}$ and the diamagnetic χ_(D), which
results in a small net χ. Although the total χ from the calculations is
of the same order as the experimentally measured value, the calculations
could not quantitatively reproduce the experimental numbers and the
anisotropy (Fig. 6). Since these calculations did not take into account
the anisotropy of χ_(D) associated with valence electrons, the above
comparison strongly suggests that χ_(D) also has a large anisotropy,
with a larger value for fields along the c axis.

both spin directions for BaRh₂As₂ (solid curve) with those for BaFe₂As₂
(dashed curve).

BaRh₂As₂ for the magnetic field H applied parallel and perpendicular to
the tetragonal c axis.

### Resistivity

The electrical resistivity r versus temperature T in the _ab_ plane is
shown in Fig. 7. The _r_(_T_) data show typical metallic behavior with a
monotonic decrease with decreasing T between 310 and 10 K. Below T = 10
K, _r_(_T_) saturates to a residual resistivity value _r_(2 K) = 29(3)
μΩ cm. There is however a slight upturn in _r_(_T_) at the lowest
temperature as seen in the inset in Fig. 7. A corresponding upturn is
also observed at low temperatures in the heat-capacity _C_(_T_) data
discussed below. This upturn in both the _r_(_T_) and _C_(_T_) data at
low temperatures may be due to the presence of a small amount of
paramagnetic impurity in the material. However, it cannot be ruled out
that this behavior is intrinsic to the material. The residual
resistivity ratio RRR =_r_(310 K)/_r_(2 K) = 5.3 for our BaRh₂As₂
crystal is typical of what is observed for single crystals of the
isostructural AFe₂As₂ (_A_ = Ba, Sr, Ca, and Eu) materials.[14, 15, 16,
18, 22, 30, 31]

### Hall effect

Figure 8(a) shows the dependence of the Hall coefficient R_(H) on
magnetic field H at various temperatures. The R_(H) is negative at all
fields and temperatures, which indicates that electron conduction
dominates the electronic transport. The R_(H) is approximately constant
with magnetic field at all temperatures. From R_(H) one obtains a lower
limit estimate of the carrier density using the single-band
expression,[32]

$$R_{H} = \frac{1}{nq},$$

where n is the carrier density and q is the charge of the current
carriers. Using the value R_(H) = 3.5 x 10-4 cm3 C-1 at 300 K and 8 T
and q = -_e_, where e is the magnitude of the charge of the electron, we
get n = 1.8 x 1022 cm-3. One can get an estimate of the density of
states at the Fermi energy _N_(E_(F)) using the single-band
relation,[33]

$$N(E_{F}) = \frac{mV_{\text{f.u.}}(3n)\frac{1}{3}}{\hbar^{2}\pi_{3}^{4}},$$

where m is the free-electron mass, _V__f._f._f._ = 210.5 A3 is the
volume per formula unit, and h is Planck’s constant divided by 2p. With
the value of n obtained above, one gets _N_(E_(F)) = 2.3 states/(eV
f.u.) for both spin directions, which is smaller than the 3.49
states/(eV f.u.) obtained above from band-structure calculations. This
suggests that both electrons and holes contribute to the electrical
conduction and the net carrier density estimated from the Hall
measurements is

Figure 8: (a) The Hall coefficient R_(H) versus magnetic field H
measured at various temperatures. (b) The Hall coefficient R_(H) versus
temperature T in a magnetic field of 8 T.

Figure 7: The resistivity r versus temperature T in the _ab_ plane for a
crystal of BaRh₂As₂ between 2 and 300 K. The inset shows the _r_(_T_)
data between 2 and 22 K on an expanded scale to highlight the residual
resistivity _ρ_0 and the slight upturn below about 5 K. As noted, the
residual resistivity ratio is RRR =_r_(310 K)/_r_(2 K) = 5.3.

smaller than the actual value for the material and/or that the
conduction-electron effective mass is greater than the free-electron
mass.

Figure 8(b) shows the plot of R_(H) versus temperature T at a magnetic
field of 8 T. The R_(H) is almost constant between T = 50 and 300 K.
Below T = 50 K, however, it decreases strongly by a factor of 4-5. In a
single-band model, the R_(H) is expected to be temperature independent
if the scattering rate t is isotropic. However, in a two-band model, the
R_(H) could be temperature dependent if, for example, the scattering
rates of the two bands have a different temperature dependence or the
fractions of charge carriers in the two bands change with
temperature.[32]

### Heat capacity

The heat capacity C versus temperature T of BaRh2As2 between 1.8 and 300
K is shown for a collection of three crystals in Fig. 9(a). The data at
high temperatures are somewhat noisy because of the small mass (_m_ =
3.2 mg) of the crystals used for the measurement. However, the heat
capacity at room temperature _C_(300 K)   120 J/mol K is close to the
classical Dulong Petit value C = 125 J/mol K expected for BaRh2As2.
Below T = 100 K the quality of the data is better. There is no signature
of any phase transition in the temperature range of our measurements.

Figure 9(b) shows the _C_(_T_)/_T_ versus T2 data between 2 and 20 K.
The _C_(_T_)/_T_ data show curvature in the whole temperature range.
This suggests that there may be anharmonic contributions to the lattice
heat capacity even at low temperatures. Only below about 10 K do the
_C_(_T_)/_T_ data show a quasilinear dependence on T2. At the lowest
temperature, the _C_/_T_ shows a tendency of saturating to a value _C_(2
K)/_T_ = 15.5 mJ/mol K2 as shown in the inset in Fig. 9(b) where the
_C_/_T_ versus T data are shown below T = 6 K. From fits to the _C_/_T_
versus T data up to 10 K by the expression _C_/_T_ = _g_/_bT_2, where g
is the Sommerfeld coefficient of the electronic heat capacity and b is
the coefficient of the lattice heat capacity, we obtain g = 4.7(9)
mJ/mol K2 and b = 1.93(4) mJ/mol K4.

The density of states at the Fermi energy for both spin directions
_N_(E_(F)) can be estimated from the above value of g using the
relation,[33]

$$\gamma = \frac{\pi^{2}}{3}k_{B}^{2}N(E_{F})(1 + \lambda_{\rm{ep}}),$$

where $\lambda_{\rm{ep}}$ is the electron-phonon coupling constant.
Setting $\lambda_{\rm{ep}}$=0 as a first approximation, one gets
_N_(E_(F)) = 2.0(4) states/(eV f.u.). This is smaller than the value
predicted from band-structure calculations _N_(E_(F)) = 3.49 states/(eV
f.u.).

From the value of b = 1.93(4) mJ/mol K4 estimated above, one can obtain
the Debye temperature $\Theta_{\rm{D}}$ using the expression[33]

$$\Theta_{\rm{D}} = \left( \frac{12\pi^{4}Rn}{5\beta} \right)^{1/3},$$

where R is the molar gas constant and n is the number of atoms per
formula unit (_n_ = 5 for BaRh2As2). We obtain $\Theta_{\rm{D}}$ =
171(2) K for BaRh2As2. The values of g and $\Theta_{\rm{D}}$ estimated
for BaRh2As2 are similar to what has been reported for the isostructural
compounds _A_Fe2As2 (_A_ = Ca, Sr, Ba, and Eu).[13, 15, 16, 17, 22]

## IV Conclusion

We have synthesized single crystalline samples of the layered rhodium
arsenide (BaRh2As2) and characterized them using single-crystal x-ray
diffraction, anisotropic magnetic susceptibility versus temperature,
resistivity versus T, and heat capacity versus T measurements between 2
and 300 K. The single-crystal structure determination confirms that
BaRh2As2 crystallizes in the tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type structure with
lattice parameters a = b = 4.0564(6) A and c = 12.797(4) A.
Single-crystal x-ray diffraction measurements down to 10 K did not show
any evidence for a structural transition. The density of states
calculations give a total density of states for both spin directions
_N_(E_(F)) = 3.49 states/(eV f.u.) with maximum contribution from the Rh
4d states. The _kh_(_T_) is small and is temperature dependent. The
small _kh_(_T_) suggests a small density of states. This is supported by
the _C_(_T_) data, which give a small Sommerfeld coefficient g = 4.7(9)
mJ/mol K2.

inset shows the _C_(_T_)/_T_ versus T2 data below T = 6 K. The solid
line through the data in the inset is a fit by the expression _C_/_T_ =
_g_/_βT_2.
