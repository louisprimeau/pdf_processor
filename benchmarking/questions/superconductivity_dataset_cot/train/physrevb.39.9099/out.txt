###### Abstract

Magnetic ordering of Er3+ ions in ErBa2Cu3Ox with 6.12 <= x <= 6.91 has been studied for both orthorhombic and tetragonal phases by means of magnetic-susceptibility and heat-capacity measurements. Superconductivity in the orthorhombic phase samples was confirmed by the onset of a diamagnetic susceptibility. The superconducting transition temperature _Tc_ was observed to decrease from 92 to 55 K as x was reduced from 6.91 to 6.31. The tetragonal samples with x = 6.23 and 6.12 remained paramagnetic down to 1.2 K and showed no overt trace of diamagnetism. The states of Er3+ ions in ErBa2Cu3O6 and ErBa2Cu3O7 were calculated by means of crystalline electric field (CEF) theory using both a point-charge model and scaled inelastic neutron scattering results for HoBa2Cu3O7. The calculated susceptibility is in excellent agreement with data on the tetragonal specimens for 1.2 K <= T <= 160 K. For the orthorhombic samples, sharp heat-capacity peaks which resemble those for a two-dimensional Ising system and evidently correspond to the magnetic ordering of Er3+ moments are found. The transition temperature _Tm_ decreases smoothly from 0.604 to 0.545 K as x is varied from 6.91 to 6.31. In contrast, tetragonal samples show only a broad rounded heat-capacity anomaly having its maximum at 0.5 K and closely resembling that for a one-dimensional _XY_ model. The change of Er3+ ion anisotropy from Ising-like to _XY_-like is explained by the CEF calculation which shows the ground state to be planar for the tetragonal phase but with the b axis slightly favored in the orthorhombic structure. Randomness in the coupling of Er3+ moments caused by structural disorder may effectively reduce the dimensionality of magnetic ordering as has been found in the case of random dilution. These results imply that the dominant magnetic interactions of Er3+ ions in these materials are of short range.

## Introduction

Following the discovery of superconductivity below _Tc_, >= 92 K in YBa2Cu3O7, it was quickly established that Y3+ ions in this compound can be fully replaced by most trivalent rare-earth ions without significantly affecting _Tc_ or the superconducting behavior.2-5 More recently, it has been found that the magnetic moments of the R3+ ions order antiferromagnetically at low temperatures _Tm_  _Tc_ for R   Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, and Er.6-12 Typically _Tm_  1 K or less, the largest value, _Tm_ = 2.2 K, occurring for R   Gd. The mechanism of the weak interionic coupling responsible for this ordering has been the subject of considerable discussion. _Tm_ is small enough to suggest that dipolar interaction is important and perhaps dominant. Any exchange interaction present would presumably be indirect, involving electrons belonging to the copper-oxygen sheets lying above and below the widely separated layers of R3+ ions. The insensitivity of _Tc_ to the choice of R3+ suggests that these ions interact negligibly with the electrons responsible for the superconductivity which apparently reside on the same two-dimensional copper-oxygen arrays. Were these the only electrons available to mediate an indirect exchange coupling of R3+s, it would appear that such exchange was negligible and dipolar coupling, indeed, dominant.

However, two recent theoretical developments indicate that such a conclusion may not be justified. Buzdin and Bulaevski [13] cite the behavior of the small-angle diffuse magnetic scattering of neutrons from ErBa2Cu3O7 as strong evidence for a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction among R3+ moments in such systems and show how this could occur via the electrons responsible for their superconductivity. At the same time, Liu [14] has shown that R3+ moments in _R_Ba2Cu3O7 may interact via conduction electrons virtually occupying states more than ~1 eV above (or below) the Fermi level. This leads to a modified RKKY-type coupling of R3+ moments and ordering independent of the superconductivity of the material.

Several additional observations also suggest that such nondipolar R3+ interactions may be important in the _R_Ba2Cu3O7 compounds. For example, the antiferromagnetic alignment of R3+ moments along the c direction seen in GdBa2Cu3O7 below _Tm_ (Ref. 15) seems unlikely with pure dipolar coupling. Two-dimensional Ising-like behavior found near T_{m} for many members of the series [9, 10, 16] suggests that the dominant interactions are short range and thus nondipolar. In those cases where ordering is observed, T_{m} is found [9-12] to scale roughly as the de Gennes factor, (g_{J} - 1)^{2}J(J + 1), in spite of the fact that crystal-field splitting of the lowest J multiplet is significant for some R^{3 +} ions in these materials.

The RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} compounds with 6 \lesssim x \lesssim 7 can be obtained in closely related orthorhombic and tetragonal structures depending on oxygen content and the oxygen microstructure [17, 18]. The high-T_{c} (\approx 92 K) orthorhombic phase occurs for x \approx 7. Reducing x yields orthorhombic superconductors with lower T_{c}'s and, eventually (x \lesssim 6.3) nonsuperconducting tetragonal semiconductors. Several groups have shown that T_{m} and the C_{p} anomaly associated with ordering in orthorhombic GdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} are only slightly altered by the removal of oxygen and conversion to the tetragonal form [19-22]. The Gd^{3 +} lattice is essentially the same in the two structures. These facts are consistent with the assumption that nondipolar R^{3 +} interactions are negligible in RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} compounds and are among the strongest items of evidence for that view. It should be noted, however, that many estimates of T_{m} using only dipolar coupling give values that are much too small [9, 16]. At the same time, recent neutron diffraction data on GdBa_{2}CuO_{x} below T_{m} give different ordered spin configurations for orthorhombic and tetragonal phases [23], a fact which is very difficult to explain with dipolar interaction alone. Perhaps the most direct indication of the presence of nondipolar interaction between Gd^{3 +} ions in GdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x}, however, is provided by the observation [24] of exchange narrowing of the paramagnetic resonance signal. The coupling constant J/k_{B} is found to be 0.1 K corresponding to an exchange field at room temperature H_{\rm ex} = 5300 Oe. This is significantly larger than the estimated dipole field H_{\rm dip} \approx 3000 Oe.

While superconductivity in the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} compounds is strongly dependent on structure and oxygen content, the evidence for GdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} suggests that rare-earth magnetic ordering is in many ways independent of those factors. However, the Gd^{3 +} ion, with its L = 0 ground state, is a rather special case. We consider it a matter of fundamental interest to examine the effects of structure and oxygen content on the magnetic ordering of other R^{3 +} ions in RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} compounds. In addition to providing perhaps further insight into the mechanism of interaction between R^{3 +} ions, such studies should reveal effects characteristic of the interaction of the single R^{3 +} ion with its crystalline environment. For example, the difference in symmetry of the crystalline electric field in the orthorhombic and tetragonal structures can have a significant effect on the nature of the ground states (single-ion anisotropies) of certain rare-earth ions. It has been shown that the moment of the Er^{3 +} ion (L = 6, S = \frac{\nu}{2} ) has a preference for orientation in the a - b plane [25, 26]. In this case, a change from tetragonal to orthorhombic symmetry could have a profound effect on the magnetic anisotropy and ordering. To explore such questions, we have measured heat capacities and magnetic susceptibilities of powder samples of ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} as a function of x and crystal class at temperatures down to 0.1 K. We have also performed crystal-field calculations to obtain estimates of the nature and degree of single-ion anisotropy in these materials.

## Experimental Details

Samples of ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.91} were prepared by solid-state reactions of appropriate amounts of Ba(NO_{3})_{2}, Er_{2}O_{3}, and CuO. The reaction mixture was heated to 700 degC in order to decompose the Ba(NO_{3})_{2} to BaO. After reginding, samples were heated in air to 950 degC for 24 h, then annealed at 450 degC for 24 h in a flowing O_{2} atmosphere. ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.91} prepared in this way was orthorhombic and single phase as determined by powder x-ray diffraction. The oxygen stoichiometry of 6.91 was determined by iodometric titration with an accuracy of +-0.03 [27].

Samples of ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} were prepared by annealing ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.91} at appropriate temperatures in a flowing N_{2} atmosphere. In all cases the oxygen stoichiometry was determined by iodometric titration. Except for the two nominally tetragonal specimens with x = 6.15 and x = 6.34, x-ray diffraction evidence of a single phase was unambiguous. The diffraction spectra in these two cases [see Fig. 1(b)] resemble very closely those reported for the tetragonal phase [see Fig. 1(c)] in peak position and relative intensity. However, they reveal very small splittings of what in the tetragonal case should be the (200) and (020) reflections. These findings led us to prepare samples with x = 6.12 and x = 6.23 for which the x-ray powder diffraction patterns proved free of this complication and

  tetragonal symmetry was clearly established [see Fig. 1(c)]. The reaction conditions for all samples are listed in Table 1.

In addition to the x-ray diffraction data taken at the time of sample preparation, additional powder spectra were obtained on portions of the sample material used in calorimetric and magnetic measurements immediately before and after they had been subjected to the handling and thermal cycling necessary in that work. The diffraction patterns showed no appreciable change for a given sample. Some of the results for orthorhombic and tetragonal samples are shown in Fig. 1 and tabulated in Table 2. The lattice constants inferred from these data agree well with values reported in the literature. [4, 17]

Heat capacities were measured between 0.4 and 100 K by a discontinuous heating method using a ^{3}He-cooled, fully automated vacuum calorimeter. C_{p} determinations were extended down to ~0.1 K by a similar technique in a ^{3}He-^{4}He dilution refrigerator. Details of these procedures have been reported elsewhere. [28] We have measured the magnetic susceptibilities of all samples between ~1.2 and 160 K by an ac mutual inductance method at a frequency of 80 Hz with a field amplitude of approximately 3 Oe. Pressed pellet and packed powder samples gave essentially the same results after correction for the demagnetizing effect of the shielding current.

## Results and Discussion

### Magnetic susceptibility

The magnetic susceptibilities of powder samples of all of the ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} compounds studied in this work are plotted as functions of the temperature over the interval ~1.2 to 160 K in Fig. 2. Above ~90 K, \chi_{p} is very nearly the same for all samples and is dominated by a contribution of the Curie-Weiss form C/(T\!-\!\Theta). The observed Curie constant in this region, C\!=\!10.9 K cm^{3}/mole, is essentially that for the free Er^{3+} ion in its ^{4}I_{15/2} ground state. Evidently the crystalline electric field acting on these ions is weak although the averaging inherent in the powder measurement may tend to obscure rather significant splittings of the ground J multiplet. It is seen in Figs. 2 and 3 that the tetragonal specimens with x\!=\!6.12 and 6.23 remain paramagnetic with \chi_{p} increasing as T falls to its lowest value. The data depart from the high-temperature Curie-Weiss law below ~70 K in a way which reflects the crystal-field splitting of the free ion ground state. Below ~10 K, \chi_{p} follows a new Curie-Weiss law with an added temperature-independent term a. Assuming only a lowest Kramers doublet with an effective spin S^{+}\!=\!\frac{1}{2} to be populated at these temperatures, the new Curie constant C\!=\!4.8 K cm^{3}/mole yields an average splitting factor g_{\rm ave}\!=\!7.2. This agrees well with the average of g_{\rm 1} and g_{\rm 1} measured for the ground doublet of Er^{3+} in several other structures with axially symmetric crystal fields. [29] The fitted Weiss constant in this region, \Theta\!=\!-0.5 K, is antiferromagnetic in sign and much closer in magnitude to the magnetic ordering temperature of the orthorhombic material, T_{m}\!\leq\!0.6 K, than the Weiss constant one obtains from data taken above 90 K, namely, \Theta\!=\!-10 K. Crystal-field splittings dominate interionic interactions in the latter case.

We have calculated the crystalline electric field (CEF) effect on Er^{3+} ions explicitly using the Stevens operator equivalent method. [30] The CEF parameters obtained for HoBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} by inelastic neutron diffraction measurements [31, 32] were scaled for the case of Er^{3+} ions. We also calculated the CEF parameters with a point-charge model which assigns +3e to Er, +2e, to Ba, -2e to O, and the charge balance to Cu. Although such a calculation did

Both sets of parameters are presented in Table 4 together with the calculated energy levels of the Er3+ ion. The magnetic susceptibilities were calculated by direct numerical diagonalization of a spin Hamiltonian matrix which includes the Zeeman term. The results for ErBa2Cu3O6 are compared with the experimental data for x = 6.12 in Fig. 3. The agreement is excellent especially with the consideration that no adjustable parameters are involved in these calculations.

In Fig. 2 we see that _kh__p_ becomes negative at sufficiently low temperatures for all samples except those with x = 6.12 and x = 6.23 whose tetragonal character is well established. In the case of the fully oxygenated orthorhombic sample (_x_ = 6.91), the onset of superconductivity occurs at T_{c}  90 K. Initially, the fall of _kh__p_ is rather abrupt below that point suggesting that the specimen is quite homogeneous. Eventually _kh__p_ reaches a minimum value which corresponds to ~85% of the sample volume being superconducting and ideally diamagnetic. Reduction in the oxygen content lowers T_{c} for a given sample while raising the minimum value of its _kh__p_. It appears that the creation of additional oxygen vacancies reduces the fraction of sample volume contributing to the diamagnetism and, presumably, to the superconductivity.

While these results are in general agreement with those of Takabatake _et al._17 they include an added feature, namely, an upturn in _kh__p_ at low temperatures where the Er3+ paramagnetism becomes appreciable. At the lowest temperatures, the curves for x = 6.91, 6.67, and 6.31 as well as x = 6.34 and 6.15 can be fitted with a Curie-Weiss law plus a negative constant term _kh_0. The fitted Curie constant increases as both x and the constant term decrease in magnitude. Such behavior appears to be consistent with a decrease in the shielding of Er3+ moments by super currents as the fraction of the specimen volume which is superconducting is reduced. In Fig. 4, the _kh_0 term is plotted against the Curie constant C for all the ErBa2Cu3O_x_ samples studied. All the data points lie on a straight line which gives C0 = 4.84 K cm3/mole for _kh_0 = 0 and _kh_ = - 13.5 cm3/mole for C = 0. This might be taken to suggest that these packed powder specimens comprise superconducting and nonsuperconducting regions and that these two parts respond to external fields almost independently. In fact, the extrapolated Curie constant, C0 = 4.84 K cm3/mole for _kh_0 = 0 is very close to the value C = 4.80 K cm3/mole obtained for the x = 6.12 sample which does not show any sign of superconductivity. When the sample consists solely of superconducting material one would expect that _kh_0 = - _V_mol/4_p_(1 - _D_) where _V_mol is the molar volume of ErBa2Cu3O_x_ and D is the demagnetizing factor. Assuming that D = \frac{1}{3} and _V_mol = 104 cm3/mole, one obtains _kh_0 = - 12.4 cm3/mole. This agrees well with the extrapolated value _kh_0. The paramagnetic contribution estimated from the magnitude of the Curie constant and the diamagnetic contribution from that of the _kh_0 value are tabulated in Table 3. In each case, these two percentages add up almost exactly to 100%. It is not clear to what microscopic entities these superconducting and nonsuperconducting regions correspond. As discussed in the previous section, the x-ray diffraction peaks of all our samples are quite sharp and reflection index assignments are unambiguous. It is not likely that these samples are simply mixtures of two distinct phases, one, for example, orthorhombic with x = 7, the other tetragonal with x = 6, so that the local stoichiometry would be quite different from the average value of x measured chemically on the bulk materials. On the other hand, given the limited resolution of the x-ray study, one cannot rule out the possibility that some of our samples are mixtures of superconducting and nonsuperconducting phases with almost matching

  lattice constants. However, as discussed below, there is a dramatic change in the low-temperature magnetic heat capacity associated with the ordering of Er3+ moments which corresponds to rather abrupt change in lattice constants. Furthermore, the onset of a diamagnetic susceptibility occurs at lower temperatures and remains sharp as x decreases. This is difficult to explain with the mixed-phase model alone. We believe that our samples are essentially single-phase material and that the variation of the ratios of the superconducting to nonsuperconducting volume reflects the change in the penetration of external fields as the value of x changes.

### Heat capacity

The magnetic contribution to the heat capacity is shown in Fig. 5 for the x\!=\!6.12 (tetragonal) and x\!=\!6.91 (orthorhombic) samples. The correction for the lattice contribution was estimated from the data [9] for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. Unlike the Gd or Dy systems, [19, 33] there is a striking difference between the heat capacities of tetragonal and orthorhombic samples of ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x}. While the x\!=\!6.91 sample exhibits a sharp cooperative heat-capacity peak at 0.60 K, only a broad rounded heat-capacity anomaly is seen for the x\!=\!6.12 specimen. One difference with our previous measurements for an x\!\cong\!7 sample [9] is that the conspicuous broad anomaly originally found at 5 K is no longer in evidence. Similar anomalies have been reported independently by several groups [7, 34]. All of which apparently used similar techniques, including BaCO_{3} as a starting material, in sample preparation. It is possible that these procedures promoted the development of a common impurity phase in all of these specimens. However, we found no obvious indication of the presence of such a phase in our sample by x-ray diffraction. At the same time, the 5-K anomaly rather clearly contained the spin entropy of a significant fraction of the Er3+ ions in the sample and these did not seem to be involved in the two-dimensional ordering of the others. In fact, the case was made [9] that they appeared to be coupled in linear chains. Comparison of the original data with those for our new x\!=\!6.91 sample suggests that, while the 5-K anomaly has been suppressed, at least part of its entropy is still present in the form of enhancement of the higher-temperature side of the 0.60-K C_{p} peak seen in Fig. 5. It is possible that different preparative procedures might lead to different kinds of distribution of oxygen vacancies in these materials and thus produce samples in which R^{\,3+} ions were coupled predominantly in two-dimensional (2D) sheets or in some mixture of one- and two-dimensional arrays.

Additional heat-capacity data were taken for samples with varied oxygen content x. The results below 2 K are shown in Fig. 6. For orthorhombic samples with x\!=\!6.91, 6.67, and 6.31, sharp heat-capacity peaks which mark the onset of long-range magnetic ordering are found. As was the case with our earlier results for an orthorhombic specimen, [9] each of these peaks strongly resembles that expected for a 2D Ising magnet. The transition temperature T_{m} decreases gradually as x decreases. On the other hand, nominally tetragonal samples (with or without any trace of orthorhombicity) do not show any sharp anomalies for x\!=\!6.12\!-\!6.34. The magnetic transition temperature T_{m} is plotted against x in Fig. 7. For the orthorhombic specimens, it is possible to extend the C_{p}(T) curve from the lowest measured point (T\!=\!0.5 K) to T\!=\!0 K using a

  suitably scaled 2D Ising C_{p} function and to evaluate the entropy S(T) = \int\!\!\int C_{p}d\ln T. The entropies of all of these samples reach a plateau at R\ln 2 between about 10 and 20 K. The entropy change involved in the extrapolation of the data amounts to \sim 20\% of R\ln 2. The extrapolation to 0 K of data on the tetragonal samples is much less uncertain. The calculated entropy again exhibits a plateau at R\ln 2 between \sim5 and 15 K. The contributions of the ground doublets of all Er^{3+} ions are thus accounted for over roughly the same temperature range in each of the ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} compounds studied.

We have already seen that the CEF theory gives a good account of the susceptibility data for the x = 6.12 and x = 6.23 samples. The same calculation predicts that the first excited doublet state of Er^{3+} lies about 119 K above the ground doublet for x = 7 and at about 96 K for x = 6 (see Table 4). Schottky-like anomalies were observed near 45 K for both the x = 6.91 and x = 6.12 samples. These evidently correspond to the thermal population of this and still higher doublets. The calculated ground-state moments are tabulated in Table 4. For x = 7, the anisotropy is strongly planar with the b axis slightly favored. We believe that the essentially 2D Ising-like behavior of the x = 6.91 system arises from the anisotropy within the a - b plane. The gradual decline in T_{m} for the orthorhombic samples may be due at least in part to the decrease in that anisotropy as the oxygen content x decreases. At the same time, of course, T_{c} is changing (see Fig. 2) and with it, presumably, characteristics of the electrons in the copper-oxygen sheets with which it seems likely that the Er^{3+} ions interact, if only weakly. It is possible, therefore, that the lowering of T_{m} with x may also reflect a reduction in the indirect exchange interaction between Er^{3+} ions as well as the reduction of the in-plane anisotropy. These two effects may be intimately linked.

When x is further reduced below \sim 6.3, RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} becomes tetragonal, the anisotropy in the a - b plane disappears and the Er^{3+} ionic moments should behave like XY spins. It seems reasonable from structural considerations to suppose that the XY interaction would couple these spins in two-dimensional arrays and to try to interpret the heat-capacity data on that basis. Monte Carlo calculations [35] reported for the 2D, S = \frac{1}{2}XY model display a rounded heat-capacity anomaly (not unlike the one we observe,) near the temperature of the unusual transition expected in such systems. The calculated curve for J/k = 0.45 K is shown in Fig. 8 together with the experimental data for the tetragonal x = 6.12 sample. The agreement is rather poor. However, also shown in Fig. 8 is a theoretical curve for a one-dimensional S = \frac{1}{2}XY model obtained with the exact results of Katsura [36] assuming J/k = 0.83 K. The agreement with experiment is striking over a relatively large range of temperature. It should be noted that the value of C_{\rm mag} at the maximum of this curve is not adjustable. Contrary to simple expectation, this coupled quantum XY system is better described by a 1D than a 2D model. Evidently, Er^{3+} spins in tetragonal ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} do not undergo a phase transition and exhib

  it only short-range magnetic ordering above ~0.1 K. To the extent that interactions among these 1D _XY_ chains are negligible, this situation could persist down to T = 0.

We have found that still further improvement of the fit of the experimental heat-capacity data on the tetragonal ErBa2Cu3Ox specimens is possible if it is assumed that Er3+ ions in these materials are actually divided into two independent magnetic subsystems having 1D _XY_ and 2D _XY_ character, respectively. As shown in Fig. 9, surprisingly good agreement with the experimental data can be obtained with such models by a proper choice of the three adjustable parameters, namely, the interaction constants J1D for the 1D and J2D for the 2D _XY_ spin systems and a fraction of 1D systems r. Figure 9 displays the results for the tetragonal specimen with x = 6.12 as well as for the x = 6.34 sample which is nominally tetragonal but exhibits traces of orthorhombic distortion. The best fit for the x = 6.34 sample was obtained with \left| {J_{\rm 1D}} \right|/k = 1.15 K, \left| {J_{\rm 2D}} \right|/k = 0.41 K, and r = 0.60. As for the x = 6.12 sample, the best parameters were \left| {J_{\rm 1D}} \right|/k = 1.11 K, \left| {J_{\rm 2D}} \right|/k = 0.37 K, and r = 0.80. It is interesting to note that the interaction constants are essentially the same for both cases. It should also be noted that the value for the coupling constant for the orthorhombic x = 6.31 sample determined by the 2D Ising model is 0.48 K and fairly close to the J2D values of the 2D _XY_ model. Despite the questionable validity of a 1D and 2D hybrid model of these systems, the above results lend support to the idea that the dramatic difference in the heat-capacity data between the tetragonal and the orthorhombic samples is primarily caused by the change in the Er3+ ion anisotropy. Similar hybrids of 1D and 2D Ising models were previously introduced by us [9,10] to explain anomalous heat-capacity

The reason for one-dimensional behavior in any of these systems is not obvious. One possibility is suggested by studies [37, 38] of randomly diluted 2D Ising-like antiferromagnets whose heat capacity and susceptibility increasingly come to resemble those of a linear chain as the percolation limit is approached. A similar effect was also observed for a 3D _XY_-like system [39]. One might speculate that removal of oxygen from the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} lattice introduces significant randomness in the magnetic coupling of Er^{3+} moments, i.e., bond dilution and disorder, leading to a similar chainlike linkage within large clusters of interacting spins. Such disordering becomes significant for smaller defect concentrations in 2D than in 3D systems. The 2D _XY_ system might be expected to be particularly sensitive even to small numbers of bond disruptions. Whether in this process one could also account for the apparent tendency toward mixed 1D and 2D behavior in these materials is not clear. We find from the data given in Ref. [37] that the effective coupling constant for the diluted system with apparent 1D Ising-like behavior is about 3 times the coupling constant of the undiluted 2D Ising-like system. The ratios \left|J_{1D}/J_{2D}\right| in our systems are also very close to 3. It should be noted that the various theoretical models considered above are relevant only if the interactions among ER^{3+} ions are primarily of short range.

###### Abstract

Magnetic ordering of Er3+ ions in ErBa2Cu3Ox with 6.12 <= x <= 6.91 has been studied for both orthorhombic and tetragonal phases by means of magnetic-susceptibility and heat-capacity measurements. Superconductivity in the orthorhombic phase samples was confirmed by the onset of a diamagnetic susceptibility. The superconducting transition temperature _Tc_ was observed to decrease from 92 to 55 K as x was reduced from 6.91 to 6.31. The tetragonal samples with x = 6.23 and 6.12 remained paramagnetic down to 1.2 K and showed no overt trace of diamagnetism. The states of Er3+ ions in ErBa2Cu3O6 and ErBa2Cu3O7 were calculated by means of crystalline electric field (CEF) theory using both a point-charge model and scaled inelastic neutron scattering results for HoBa2Cu3O7. The calculated susceptibility is in excellent agreement with data on the tetragonal specimens for 1.2 K <= T <= 160 K. For the orthorhombic samples, sharp heat-capacity peaks which resemble those for a two-dimensional Ising system and evidently correspond to the magnetic ordering of Er3+ moments are found. The transition temperature _Tm_ decreases smoothly from 0.604 to 0.545 K as x is varied from 6.91 to 6.31. In contrast, tetragonal samples show only a broad rounded heat-capacity anomaly having its maximum at 0.5 K and closely resembling that for a one-dimensional _XY_ model. The change of Er3+ ion anisotropy from Ising-like to _XY_-like is explained by the CEF calculation which shows the ground state to be planar for the tetragonal phase but with the b axis slightly favored in the orthorhombic structure. Randomness in the coupling of Er3+ moments caused by structural disorder may effectively reduce the dimensionality of magnetic ordering as has been found in the case of random dilution. These results imply that the dominant magnetic interactions of Er3+ ions in these materials are of short range.

## Introduction

Following the discovery of superconductivity below _Tc_, >= 92 K in YBa2Cu3O7, it was quickly established that Y3+ ions in this compound can be fully replaced by most trivalent rare-earth ions without significantly affecting _Tc_ or the superconducting behavior.2-5 More recently, it has been found that the magnetic moments of the R3+ ions order antiferromagnetically at low temperatures _Tm_  _Tc_ for R   Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, and Er.6-12 Typically _Tm_  1 K or less, the largest value, _Tm_ = 2.2 K, occurring for R   Gd. The mechanism of the weak interionic coupling responsible for this ordering has been the subject of considerable discussion. _Tm_ is small enough to suggest that dipolar interaction is important and perhaps dominant. Any exchange interaction present would presumably be indirect, involving electrons belonging to the copper-oxygen sheets lying above and below the widely separated layers of R3+ ions. The insensitivity of _Tc_ to the choice of R3+ suggests that these ions interact negligibly with the electrons responsible for the superconductivity which apparently reside on the same two-dimensional copper-oxygen arrays. Were these the only electrons available to mediate an indirect exchange coupling of R3+s, it would appear that such exchange was negligible and dipolar coupling, indeed, dominant.

However, two recent theoretical developments indicate that such a conclusion may not be justified. Buzdin and Bulaevski [13] cite the behavior of the small-angle diffuse magnetic scattering of neutrons from ErBa2Cu3O7 as strong evidence for a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction among R3+ moments in such systems and show how this could occur via the electrons responsible for their superconductivity. At the same time, Liu [14] has shown that R3+ moments in _R_Ba2Cu3O7 may interact via conduction electrons virtually occupying states more than ~1 eV above (or below) the Fermi level. This leads to a modified RKKY-type coupling of R3+ moments and ordering independent of the superconductivity of the material.

Several additional observations also suggest that such nondipolar R3+ interactions may be important in the _R_Ba2Cu3O7 compounds. For example, the antiferromagnetic alignment of R3+ moments along the c direction seen in GdBa2Cu3O7 below _Tm_ (Ref. 15) seems unlikely with pure dipolar coupling. Two-dimensional Ising-like behavior found near T_{m} for many members of the series [9, 10, 16] suggests that the dominant interactions are short range and thus nondipolar. In those cases where ordering is observed, T_{m} is found [9-12] to scale roughly as the de Gennes factor, (g_{J} - 1)^{2}J(J + 1), in spite of the fact that crystal-field splitting of the lowest J multiplet is significant for some R^{3 +} ions in these materials.

The RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} compounds with 6 \lesssim x \lesssim 7 can be obtained in closely related orthorhombic and tetragonal structures depending on oxygen content and the oxygen microstructure [17, 18]. The high-T_{c} (\approx 92 K) orthorhombic phase occurs for x \approx 7. Reducing x yields orthorhombic superconductors with lower T_{c}'s and, eventually (x \lesssim 6.3) nonsuperconducting tetragonal semiconductors. Several groups have shown that T_{m} and the C_{p} anomaly associated with ordering in orthorhombic GdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} are only slightly altered by the removal of oxygen and conversion to the tetragonal form [19-22]. The Gd^{3 +} lattice is essentially the same in the two structures. These facts are consistent with the assumption that nondipolar R^{3 +} interactions are negligible in RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} compounds and are among the strongest items of evidence for that view. It should be noted, however, that many estimates of T_{m} using only dipolar coupling give values that are much too small [9, 16]. At the same time, recent neutron diffraction data on GdBa_{2}CuO_{x} below T_{m} give different ordered spin configurations for orthorhombic and tetragonal phases [23], a fact which is very difficult to explain with dipolar interaction alone. Perhaps the most direct indication of the presence of nondipolar interaction between Gd^{3 +} ions in GdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x}, however, is provided by the observation [24] of exchange narrowing of the paramagnetic resonance signal. The coupling constant J/k_{B} is found to be 0.1 K corresponding to an exchange field at room temperature H_{\rm ex} = 5300 Oe. This is significantly larger than the estimated dipole field H_{\rm dip} \approx 3000 Oe.

While superconductivity in the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} compounds is strongly dependent on structure and oxygen content, the evidence for GdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} suggests that rare-earth magnetic ordering is in many ways independent of those factors. However, the Gd^{3 +} ion, with its L = 0 ground state, is a rather special case. We consider it a matter of fundamental interest to examine the effects of structure and oxygen content on the magnetic ordering of other R^{3 +} ions in RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} compounds. In addition to providing perhaps further insight into the mechanism of interaction between R^{3 +} ions, such studies should reveal effects characteristic of the interaction of the single R^{3 +} ion with its crystalline environment. For example, the difference in symmetry of the crystalline electric field in the orthorhombic and tetragonal structures can have a significant effect on the nature of the ground states (single-ion anisotropies) of certain rare-earth ions. It has been shown that the moment of the Er^{3 +} ion (L = 6, S = \frac{\nu}{2} ) has a preference for orientation in the a - b plane [25, 26]. In this case, a change from tetragonal to orthorhombic symmetry could have a profound effect on the magnetic anisotropy and ordering. To explore such questions, we have measured heat capacities and magnetic susceptibilities of powder samples of ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} as a function of x and crystal class at temperatures down to 0.1 K. We have also performed crystal-field calculations to obtain estimates of the nature and degree of single-ion anisotropy in these materials.

## Experimental Details

Samples of ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.91} were prepared by solid-state reactions of appropriate amounts of Ba(NO_{3})_{2}, Er_{2}O_{3}, and CuO. The reaction mixture was heated to 700 degC in order to decompose the Ba(NO_{3})_{2} to BaO. After reginding, samples were heated in air to 950 degC for 24 h, then annealed at 450 degC for 24 h in a flowing O_{2} atmosphere. ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.91} prepared in this way was orthorhombic and single phase as determined by powder x-ray diffraction. The oxygen stoichiometry of 6.91 was determined by iodometric titration with an accuracy of +-0.03 [27].

Samples of ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} were prepared by annealing ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.91} at appropriate temperatures in a flowing N_{2} atmosphere. In all cases the oxygen stoichiometry was determined by iodometric titration. Except for the two nominally tetragonal specimens with x = 6.15 and x = 6.34, x-ray diffraction evidence of a single phase was unambiguous. The diffraction spectra in these two cases [see Fig. 1(b)] resemble very closely those reported for the tetragonal phase [see Fig. 1(c)] in peak position and relative intensity. However, they reveal very small splittings of what in the tetragonal case should be the (200) and (020) reflections. These findings led us to prepare samples with x = 6.12 and x = 6.23 for which the x-ray powder diffraction patterns proved free of this complication and

  tetragonal symmetry was clearly established [see Fig. 1(c)]. The reaction conditions for all samples are listed in Table 1.

In addition to the x-ray diffraction data taken at the time of sample preparation, additional powder spectra were obtained on portions of the sample material used in calorimetric and magnetic measurements immediately before and after they had been subjected to the handling and thermal cycling necessary in that work. The diffraction patterns showed no appreciable change for a given sample. Some of the results for orthorhombic and tetragonal samples are shown in Fig. 1 and tabulated in Table 2. The lattice constants inferred from these data agree well with values reported in the literature. [4, 17]

Heat capacities were measured between 0.4 and 100 K by a discontinuous heating method using a ^{3}He-cooled, fully automated vacuum calorimeter. C_{p} determinations were extended down to ~0.1 K by a similar technique in a ^{3}He-^{4}He dilution refrigerator. Details of these procedures have been reported elsewhere. [28] We have measured the magnetic susceptibilities of all samples between ~1.2 and 160 K by an ac mutual inductance method at a frequency of 80 Hz with a field amplitude of approximately 3 Oe. Pressed pellet and packed powder samples gave essentially the same results after correction for the demagnetizing effect of the shielding current.

## Results and Discussion

### Magnetic susceptibility

The magnetic susceptibilities of powder samples of all of the ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} compounds studied in this work are plotted as functions of the temperature over the interval ~1.2 to 160 K in Fig. 2. Above ~90 K, \chi_{p} is very nearly the same for all samples and is dominated by a contribution of the Curie-Weiss form C/(T\!-\!\Theta). The observed Curie constant in this region, C\!=\!10.9 K cm^{3}/mole, is essentially that for the free Er^{3+} ion in its ^{4}I_{15/2} ground state. Evidently the crystalline electric field acting on these ions is weak although the averaging inherent in the powder measurement may tend to obscure rather significant splittings of the ground J multiplet. It is seen in Figs. 2 and 3 that the tetragonal specimens with x\!=\!6.12 and 6.23 remain paramagnetic with \chi_{p} increasing as T falls to its lowest value. The data depart from the high-temperature Curie-Weiss law below ~70 K in a way which reflects the crystal-field splitting of the free ion ground state. Below ~10 K, \chi_{p} follows a new Curie-Weiss law with an added temperature-independent term a. Assuming only a lowest Kramers doublet with an effective spin S^{+}\!=\!\frac{1}{2} to be populated at these temperatures, the new Curie constant C\!=\!4.8 K cm^{3}/mole yields an average splitting factor g_{\rm ave}\!=\!7.2. This agrees well with the average of g_{\rm 1} and g_{\rm 1} measured for the ground doublet of Er^{3+} in several other structures with axially symmetric crystal fields. [29] The fitted Weiss constant in this region, \Theta\!=\!-0.5 K, is antiferromagnetic in sign and much closer in magnitude to the magnetic ordering temperature of the orthorhombic material, T_{m}\!\leq\!0.6 K, than the Weiss constant one obtains from data taken above 90 K, namely, \Theta\!=\!-10 K. Crystal-field splittings dominate interionic interactions in the latter case.

We have calculated the crystalline electric field (CEF) effect on Er^{3+} ions explicitly using the Stevens operator equivalent method. [30] The CEF parameters obtained for HoBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} by inelastic neutron diffraction measurements [31, 32] were scaled for the case of Er^{3+} ions. We also calculated the CEF parameters with a point-charge model which assigns +3e to Er, +2e, to Ba, -2e to O, and the charge balance to Cu. Although such a calculation did

Both sets of parameters are presented in Table 4 together with the calculated energy levels of the Er3+ ion. The magnetic susceptibilities were calculated by direct numerical diagonalization of a spin Hamiltonian matrix which includes the Zeeman term. The results for ErBa2Cu3O6 are compared with the experimental data for x = 6.12 in Fig. 3. The agreement is excellent especially with the consideration that no adjustable parameters are involved in these calculations.

In Fig. 2 we see that _kh__p_ becomes negative at sufficiently low temperatures for all samples except those with x = 6.12 and x = 6.23 whose tetragonal character is well established. In the case of the fully oxygenated orthorhombic sample (_x_ = 6.91), the onset of superconductivity occurs at T_{c}  90 K. Initially, the fall of _kh__p_ is rather abrupt below that point suggesting that the specimen is quite homogeneous. Eventually _kh__p_ reaches a minimum value which corresponds to ~85% of the sample volume being superconducting and ideally diamagnetic. Reduction in the oxygen content lowers T_{c} for a given sample while raising the minimum value of its _kh__p_. It appears that the creation of additional oxygen vacancies reduces the fraction of sample volume contributing to the diamagnetism and, presumably, to the superconductivity.

While these results are in general agreement with those of Takabatake _et al._17 they include an added feature, namely, an upturn in _kh__p_ at low temperatures where the Er3+ paramagnetism becomes appreciable. At the lowest temperatures, the curves for x = 6.91, 6.67, and 6.31 as well as x = 6.34 and 6.15 can be fitted with a Curie-Weiss law plus a negative constant term _kh_0. The fitted Curie constant increases as both x and the constant term decrease in magnitude. Such behavior appears to be consistent with a decrease in the shielding of Er3+ moments by super currents as the fraction of the specimen volume which is superconducting is reduced. In Fig. 4, the _kh_0 term is plotted against the Curie constant C for all the ErBa2Cu3O_x_ samples studied. All the data points lie on a straight line which gives C0 = 4.84 K cm3/mole for _kh_0 = 0 and _kh_ = - 13.5 cm3/mole for C = 0. This might be taken to suggest that these packed powder specimens comprise superconducting and nonsuperconducting regions and that these two parts respond to external fields almost independently. In fact, the extrapolated Curie constant, C0 = 4.84 K cm3/mole for _kh_0 = 0 is very close to the value C = 4.80 K cm3/mole obtained for the x = 6.12 sample which does not show any sign of superconductivity. When the sample consists solely of superconducting material one would expect that _kh_0 = - _V_mol/4_p_(1 - _D_) where _V_mol is the molar volume of ErBa2Cu3O_x_ and D is the demagnetizing factor. Assuming that D = \frac{1}{3} and _V_mol = 104 cm3/mole, one obtains _kh_0 = - 12.4 cm3/mole. This agrees well with the extrapolated value _kh_0. The paramagnetic contribution estimated from the magnitude of the Curie constant and the diamagnetic contribution from that of the _kh_0 value are tabulated in Table 3. In each case, these two percentages add up almost exactly to 100%. It is not clear to what microscopic entities these superconducting and nonsuperconducting regions correspond. As discussed in the previous section, the x-ray diffraction peaks of all our samples are quite sharp and reflection index assignments are unambiguous. It is not likely that these samples are simply mixtures of two distinct phases, one, for example, orthorhombic with x = 7, the other tetragonal with x = 6, so that the local stoichiometry would be quite different from the average value of x measured chemically on the bulk materials. On the other hand, given the limited resolution of the x-ray study, one cannot rule out the possibility that some of our samples are mixtures of superconducting and nonsuperconducting phases with almost matching

  lattice constants. However, as discussed below, there is a dramatic change in the low-temperature magnetic heat capacity associated with the ordering of Er3+ moments which corresponds to rather abrupt change in lattice constants. Furthermore, the onset of a diamagnetic susceptibility occurs at lower temperatures and remains sharp as x decreases. This is difficult to explain with the mixed-phase model alone. We believe that our samples are essentially single-phase material and that the variation of the ratios of the superconducting to nonsuperconducting volume reflects the change in the penetration of external fields as the value of x changes.

### Heat capacity

The magnetic contribution to the heat capacity is shown in Fig. 5 for the x\!=\!6.12 (tetragonal) and x\!=\!6.91 (orthorhombic) samples. The correction for the lattice contribution was estimated from the data [9] for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. Unlike the Gd or Dy systems, [19, 33] there is a striking difference between the heat capacities of tetragonal and orthorhombic samples of ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x}. While the x\!=\!6.91 sample exhibits a sharp cooperative heat-capacity peak at 0.60 K, only a broad rounded heat-capacity anomaly is seen for the x\!=\!6.12 specimen. One difference with our previous measurements for an x\!\cong\!7 sample [9] is that the conspicuous broad anomaly originally found at 5 K is no longer in evidence. Similar anomalies have been reported independently by several groups [7, 34]. All of which apparently used similar techniques, including BaCO_{3} as a starting material, in sample preparation. It is possible that these procedures promoted the development of a common impurity phase in all of these specimens. However, we found no obvious indication of the presence of such a phase in our sample by x-ray diffraction. At the same time, the 5-K anomaly rather clearly contained the spin entropy of a significant fraction of the Er3+ ions in the sample and these did not seem to be involved in the two-dimensional ordering of the others. In fact, the case was made [9] that they appeared to be coupled in linear chains. Comparison of the original data with those for our new x\!=\!6.91 sample suggests that, while the 5-K anomaly has been suppressed, at least part of its entropy is still present in the form of enhancement of the higher-temperature side of the 0.60-K C_{p} peak seen in Fig. 5. It is possible that different preparative procedures might lead to different kinds of distribution of oxygen vacancies in these materials and thus produce samples in which R^{\,3+} ions were coupled predominantly in two-dimensional (2D) sheets or in some mixture of one- and two-dimensional arrays.

Additional heat-capacity data were taken for samples with varied oxygen content x. The results below 2 K are shown in Fig. 6. For orthorhombic samples with x\!=\!6.91, 6.67, and 6.31, sharp heat-capacity peaks which mark the onset of long-range magnetic ordering are found. As was the case with our earlier results for an orthorhombic specimen, [9] each of these peaks strongly resembles that expected for a 2D Ising magnet. The transition temperature T_{m} decreases gradually as x decreases. On the other hand, nominally tetragonal samples (with or without any trace of orthorhombicity) do not show any sharp anomalies for x\!=\!6.12\!-\!6.34. The magnetic transition temperature T_{m} is plotted against x in Fig. 7. For the orthorhombic specimens, it is possible to extend the C_{p}(T) curve from the lowest measured point (T\!=\!0.5 K) to T\!=\!0 K using a

  suitably scaled 2D Ising C_{p} function and to evaluate the entropy S(T) = \int\!\!\int C_{p}d\ln T. The entropies of all of these samples reach a plateau at R\ln 2 between about 10 and 20 K. The entropy change involved in the extrapolation of the data amounts to \sim 20\% of R\ln 2. The extrapolation to 0 K of data on the tetragonal samples is much less uncertain. The calculated entropy again exhibits a plateau at R\ln 2 between \sim5 and 15 K. The contributions of the ground doublets of all Er^{3+} ions are thus accounted for over roughly the same temperature range in each of the ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} compounds studied.

We have already seen that the CEF theory gives a good account of the susceptibility data for the x = 6.12 and x = 6.23 samples. The same calculation predicts that the first excited doublet state of Er^{3+} lies about 119 K above the ground doublet for x = 7 and at about 96 K for x = 6 (see Table 4). Schottky-like anomalies were observed near 45 K for both the x = 6.91 and x = 6.12 samples. These evidently correspond to the thermal population of this and still higher doublets. The calculated ground-state moments are tabulated in Table 4. For x = 7, the anisotropy is strongly planar with the b axis slightly favored. We believe that the essentially 2D Ising-like behavior of the x = 6.91 system arises from the anisotropy within the a - b plane. The gradual decline in T_{m} for the orthorhombic samples may be due at least in part to the decrease in that anisotropy as the oxygen content x decreases. At the same time, of course, T_{c} is changing (see Fig. 2) and with it, presumably, characteristics of the electrons in the copper-oxygen sheets with which it seems likely that the Er^{3+} ions interact, if only weakly. It is possible, therefore, that the lowering of T_{m} with x may also reflect a reduction in the indirect exchange interaction between Er^{3+} ions as well as the reduction of the in-plane anisotropy. These two effects may be intimately linked.

When x is further reduced below \sim 6.3, RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} becomes tetragonal, the anisotropy in the a - b plane disappears and the Er^{3+} ionic moments should behave like XY spins. It seems reasonable from structural considerations to suppose that the XY interaction would couple these spins in two-dimensional arrays and to try to interpret the heat-capacity data on that basis. Monte Carlo calculations [35] reported for the 2D, S = \frac{1}{2}XY model display a rounded heat-capacity anomaly (not unlike the one we observe,) near the temperature of the unusual transition expected in such systems. The calculated curve for J/k = 0.45 K is shown in Fig. 8 together with the experimental data for the tetragonal x = 6.12 sample. The agreement is rather poor. However, also shown in Fig. 8 is a theoretical curve for a one-dimensional S = \frac{1}{2}XY model obtained with the exact results of Katsura [36] assuming J/k = 0.83 K. The agreement with experiment is striking over a relatively large range of temperature. It should be noted that the value of C_{\rm mag} at the maximum of this curve is not adjustable. Contrary to simple expectation, this coupled quantum XY system is better described by a 1D than a 2D model. Evidently, Er^{3+} spins in tetragonal ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} do not undergo a phase transition and exhib

  it only short-range magnetic ordering above ~0.1 K. To the extent that interactions among these 1D _XY_ chains are negligible, this situation could persist down to T = 0.

We have found that still further improvement of the fit of the experimental heat-capacity data on the tetragonal ErBa2Cu3Ox specimens is possible if it is assumed that Er3+ ions in these materials are actually divided into two independent magnetic subsystems having 1D _XY_ and 2D _XY_ character, respectively. As shown in Fig. 9, surprisingly good agreement with the experimental data can be obtained with such models by a proper choice of the three adjustable parameters, namely, the interaction constants J1D for the 1D and J2D for the 2D _XY_ spin systems and a fraction of 1D systems r. Figure 9 displays the results for the tetragonal specimen with x = 6.12 as well as for the x = 6.34 sample which is nominally tetragonal but exhibits traces of orthorhombic distortion. The best fit for the x = 6.34 sample was obtained with \left| {J_{\rm 1D}} \right|/k = 1.15 K, \left| {J_{\rm 2D}} \right|/k = 0.41 K, and r = 0.60. As for the x = 6.12 sample, the best parameters were \left| {J_{\rm 1D}} \right|/k = 1.11 K, \left| {J_{\rm 2D}} \right|/k = 0.37 K, and r = 0.80. It is interesting to note that the interaction constants are essentially the same for both cases. It should also be noted that the value for the coupling constant for the orthorhombic x = 6.31 sample determined by the 2D Ising model is 0.48 K and fairly close to the J2D values of the 2D _XY_ model. Despite the questionable validity of a 1D and 2D hybrid model of these systems, the above results lend support to the idea that the dramatic difference in the heat-capacity data between the tetragonal and the orthorhombic samples is primarily caused by the change in the Er3+ ion anisotropy. Similar hybrids of 1D and 2D Ising models were previously introduced by us [9,10] to explain anomalous heat-capacity

The reason for one-dimensional behavior in any of these systems is not obvious. One possibility is suggested by studies [37, 38] of randomly diluted 2D Ising-like antiferromagnets whose heat capacity and susceptibility increasingly come to resemble those of a linear chain as the percolation limit is approached. A similar effect was also observed for a 3D _XY_-like system [39]. One might speculate that removal of oxygen from the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} lattice introduces significant randomness in the magnetic coupling of Er^{3+} moments, i.e., bond dilution and disorder, leading to a similar chainlike linkage within large clusters of interacting spins. Such disordering becomes significant for smaller defect concentrations in 2D than in 3D systems. The 2D _XY_ system might be expected to be particularly sensitive even to small numbers of bond disruptions. Whether in this process one could also account for the apparent tendency toward mixed 1D and 2D behavior in these materials is not clear. We find from the data given in Ref. [37] that the effective coupling constant for the diluted system with apparent 1D Ising-like behavior is about 3 times the coupling constant of the undiluted 2D Ising-like system. The ratios \left|J_{1D}/J_{2D}\right| in our systems are also very close to 3. It should be noted that the various theoretical models considered above are relevant only if the interactions among ER^{3+} ions are primarily of short range.
