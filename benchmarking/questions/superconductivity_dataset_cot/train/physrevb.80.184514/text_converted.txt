###### Abstract

We report the measurements of resistivity and magnetization under
magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the basal plane,
respectively, on a cobalt-doped Eu(Fe_(0.89)Co_(0.11))₂As₂ single
crystal. We observed a resistivity drop at T_(c)∼21 K, which shifts
toward lower temperatures under external fields, suggesting a
superconducting transition. The upper critical fields near T_(c) show
large anisotropy, in contrast with those of other "122" FeAs-based
superconductors. Low-field magnetic susceptibility data also show
evidence of superconductivity below 21 K. Instead of the expected zero
resistance below T_(c), however, a resistivity re-entrance appears at 17
K under zero field, coincident with the magnetic ordering of Eu²⁺
moments. Based on the temperature and field dependences of anisotropic
magnetization, a helical magnetic structure for the Eu²⁺ spins is
proposed. External magnetic fields easily change the helimagnetism into
ferromagnetism with fully polarized Eu²⁺ spins, accompanying by
disappearance of the resistivity re-entrance. Therefore,
superconductivity coexists with ferromagnetic state of Eu²⁺ spins under
relatively low magnetic field. The magnetic and superconducting phase
diagrams are finally summarized for both H∥ab and H∥c.

## I Introduction

Superconductivity (SC) and ferromagnetism (FM) are mutually antagonistic
cooperative phenomena, because superconducting state expels magnetic
flux (Meissner effect) but FM generates the internal magnetic field. On
one hand, the internal field generated by FM destroys SC in two ways:
orbital effect [1] and paramagnetic effect (in the case of spin-singlet
SC). [2] On the other hand, SC does not favor FM since SC state
suppresses the zero wave-vector component of the electronic
susceptibility, χ(0), which is crucial to mediate the localized moments
via the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction. The
incompatible nature of SC and local-moment FM was demonstrated in
ErRh₄B₄ (Ref. [3]) and Ho_(1.2)Mo₆S₈ (Ref. [4]) which show the
destruction of SC at the onset of long-range magnetic order. Later the
repulsive effects between SC and FM were observed in a family of layered
compounds RNi₂B₂C (R=Tm, Er, Ho, and Dy). [5] The interplay between SC
and FM was also reported in Ru-layer-containing cuprates, where magnetic
ordering temperatures are much higher than SC transition temperatures.
[6, 7] Interestingly, SC and local-moment [8] FM could be reconciled by
considering their difference in interaction length scale. Earlier
theoretical work [9] pointed out that SC could coexist with modulated FM
such as spiral/helical magnetic configuration or multidomain structure.
Later, it was theoretically shown that SC could be in the form of
spontaneous vortex state [10, 11] to facilitate the FM ordering.
However, there have been few experimental evidences on how SC coexists
with the FM. [12]

Doped EuFe₂As₂ system is another candidate for searching the coexistence
of SC and local-moment FM. This material consists of two subsystems: (1)
anti-fluorite-type Fe₂As₂ layers responsible for occurrence of
superconductivity and (2) local-moment-carrying Eu²⁺ ions sandwiched by
the Fe₂As₂ layers. In the undoped parent compound EuFe₂As₂, the two
subsystems undergo an antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-density wave (SDW)
transition associated with Fe moments at 190 K and another AFM ordering
for Eu²⁺ spins at 19 K, respectively. [13, 14, 15, 16] The magnetic
structure of the latter AFM order was proposed to be of A type, [17] in
which Eu²⁺ spins align ferromagnetically in the basal planes but
antiferromagnetically along the c axis, based on the anisotropic
magnetic and magnetotransport measurements. This magnetic structure was
very recently confirmed by the magnetic resonant x-ray scattering [18]
and neutron diffraction [19] experiments.

By the partial substitution of Eu with K, SC over 30 K was reported in
Eu_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂. [20] However, no magnetic ordering for Eu²⁺ spins
was observed, probably due to the dilution effect by the Eu-site doping.
In the case of Fe-site doping, although superconductivity at 20 K was
obtained in BaFe_(2 − x)Ni_(x)As₂, [21] attempt to obtain SC in
EuFe_(2 − x)Ni_(x)As₂ was unsuccessful. [22] Instead, the Ni doping
leads to FM ordering for the Eu²⁺ moments. By phosphorus doping at the
As site, which also keeps Eu²⁺ sublattice undisturbed, we found bulk SC
at T_(c)=26 K followed by a local-moment FM at 20 K in
EuFe₂(As_(0.7)O₃)₂. [23] In fact, with applying pressure,
superconductivity at 29 K was reported in the undoped EuFe₂As₂, [24, 25]
where the AFM ordering for Eu²⁺ moments was proposed. The above results
suggest that the prerequisite for finding the coexistence of SC and
local-moment magnetism in Eu-containing arsenides is that T_(c) should
be higher than the magnetic ordering temperature T_(M). Note that the
maximum T_(c) in BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂ is as high as 25 K (Ref. [26]);
therefore, we investigated the Eu(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ system.
Consequently, evidence of SC transition was observed for 0.09≤x<0.15,
basically consistent with a very recent report by Zheng _et al._[27]

In this paper, we present detailed measurements of the resistivity and
magnetization under magnetic fields using well-characterized single
crystals of Eu(Fe_(0.89)Co_(0.11))₂As₂. We observed a resistivity drop
at 21 K for both in-plane (ρ_(ab)) and out-of-plane (ρ_(c))
resistivities, which is ascribed to a SC transition. Evidence of
superconductivity is also given by low-field magnetic susceptibility
measurement. Followed by the SC transition, a resistivity re-entrance
appears as the Eu²⁺ spins order spontaneously. By analyzing the
temperature and field dependences of anisotropic magnetization, and
comparing with the magnetic structure of EuFe₂As₂, a helical magnetic
structure for Eu²⁺ spins was proposed. External magnetic field
reorientates the Eu²⁺ moments easily, changing the helimagnetism (HM)
into ferromagnetism. Finally, the magnetic and superconducting phase
diagrams were established, exhibiting the intriguing coexistence of SC
and long-range magnetic ordering in Eu(Fe_(0.89)Co_(0.11))₂As₂.

## II II. Experimental

Single crystals of Eu(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ were grown using (Fe,Co)As
as the self-flux, similar to previous reports.[17, 28] (Fe,Co)As with
the atomic ratio Fe:Co=(1−_x_):_x_ was pre-esvthesized by reacting Fe
powders with As shots in vacuum at 773 K for 6 h and then at 1030 K for
12 h. Fresh Eu grains and Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x)As powders were thoroughly
mixed in a molar ratio of 1:4. The mixture was loaded into an alumina
tube then put into a quartz ampoule. The sealed quartz ampoule was
heated to 1053 K at a heating rate of 150 K/h holding at this
temperature for 10 h. Subsequently, the temperature was raised to 1398 K
in 3 h holding for 5 h. The crystals were grown by slowly cooling to
1223 K at a cooling rate of 2 K/h. Finally, the quartz ampoule was
cooled to room temperature by shutting off the furnace. Many shiny
platelike crystals with the typical size of 3 x 2 x 0.1 mm³ were
obtained.

The crystals were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and
field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive
x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. XRD was performed using a D/Max-rA
diffractometer with Cu _Kα_ radiation and a graphite monochromator. SEM
image was taken in a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Sirion
FEI, The Netherlands) equipped with a Phoenix EDAX x-ray spectrometer.
Figure 1 shows the morphological, compositional, and structural
characterizations on a Co-doped EuFe₂As₂ crystal. The SEM image of the
crystal measured shows large area of flat surfaces with only minor
impurities adhered to. Quantitative analysis for the EDX spectra
indicates that the composition is Eu(Fe_(0.89)Co_(0.11))₂As₂ within the
measurement error (± 5

Electrical resistivity was measured using a standard four-terminal
method. The electrode configuration in Ref. [28] was employed for
measuring ρ_(c). The dc magnetization was measured on a Quantum Design
magnetic property measurement system (MPMS-5). The crystal was carefully
mounted on a sample holder, with the applied field perpendicular or
parallel to the crystallographic c axis. The deviation angle was
estimated to be less than 5^(∘).

We found that the SDW transition in the parent compound was suppressed
with the Co doping, like the cases in other iron arsenides.[26, 29] For
0.09 ≤_x_ < 0.15, resistivity drop due to a SC transition was observed
around 20 K. The sample of x = 0.09 showed a resistivity upturn at 30 K
due to the residual SDW transition. For the sample with x = 0.11, no
clear evidence of SDW transition could be observed. Compared with the
Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ system,[26] the optimal doping level in
Eu(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ shifts to a larger value. In this paper we
focus on the physical property measurements for the optimally doped
sample with x = 0.11.

## III III. Results and Discussion

### A. Resistivity

Figure 2 shows ρ_(ab) and ρ_(c) for Eu(Fe_(0.89)Co_(0.11))₂As₂ crystals
under zero field. While ρ_(c) is nearly 50 times larger than ρ_(ab),
their temperature dependences are almost the same. At high temperatures
both show usual metallic behavior. Around 20 K the resistivity drops by
over 30

zero field. Upper left inset is an expanded plot in comparison with the
data of the nonsuperconducting EuFe₂As₂ crystals. Lower right inset
displays the anisotropic ratio ρ_(c)/ρ_(ab), showing two peaks
associated with superconducting and magnetic transitions, respectively.

spectroscopy (bottom right).

regime. At lower temperatures, the resistivity tends to saturate at a
residual value. This result resembles the behavior of EuFe₂As₂ under
high pressures,[24] which was ascribed as a re-entrant
superconductivity. The two transitions can also be manifested by the
anomalous peaks in ρ_(c)/ρ_(ab), shown in the lower inset of Fig. 2.

To clarify the above two resistivity anomalies, we performed the
magnetoresistance (MR) measurements. Figure 3(a) shows the in-plane
resistivity under magnetic fields parallel to the basal planes
(hereafter denoted by H∥ab). As expected for a SC transition, the
resistivity drop shifts to lower temperatures with increasing magnetic
fields. On the other hand, the resistivity peak is drastically
suppressed by the applied fields. When the applied field is
perpendicular to the basal planes, as shown in Fig. 3(b), the SC
transition is suppressed more severely by the field. However, the
resistivity peak is not influenced very much until it is "buried" by the
SC transition. The inset of Fig. 4 clearly shows the different responses
of $T_{\rm ret}$ to the applied field along different directions. This
observation is in sharp contrast with that in RNi₂B₂C₂
superconductors,[5] where the re-entrant region becomes much enlarged by
the external field.

From the magnetoresistivity data, the upper critical fields were
determined by using the criterion of 90

Figure 5 shows the isothermal resistivity under magnetic field parallel
or perpendicular to the basal planes. At 30 K, the resistivity decreases
monotonically with the field. Negative MR was also observed in EuFe₂As₂
just above the Eu-AFM ordering temperature,[17] which was ascribed to
the reduction in Eu-spin disorder scattering by the external magnetic
field. At 21 and 17 K, an abrupt increase in resistivity at relatively
low fields, especially for H⊥ab, is observed, representing the
transition from superconductivity to normal state. The normal-state
ρ_(ab)^(∥) increases with the field, which reflects the intrinsic
transport property of FeAs layers

because of field-induced ferromagnetic transition. At 10 K, SC coexists
with the helical magnetic order (see the next section) at low fields.
The resistivity first decreases to a minimum at H^(*) then increases
again with the field. The decrease in ρ_(ab) is related to the
reorientation of Eu²⁺ moments, because H^(*)=H_(s) (H_(s) refers to the
saturated field; see Fig. 9 in the next section). The increase in ρ_(ab)
is probably due to the increase in SC vortices by the external field
and/or the intrinsic tensor property of FeAs layers. At 2 and 4 K,
ρ_(ab)^(⊥) first increases to a maximum at H^(*) and then starts to
decrease with the field. In the case of H∥ab, ρ_(ab)^(∥) first increases
also, then decreases to a minimum at H^(*)=H_(s). Interestingly, another
maximum appears at higher field. These data should reflect the interplay
between SC and magnetism, but we fail to have a sound explanation at
present. The nonzero resistance is probably due to the dissipation of
the motion of spontaneous vortex, generated by the magnetic ordering of
Eu²⁺ spins. However, such spontaneous vortex should be directly
evidenced before a quantitative understanding.

### Magnetic properties

Figure 6 shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility.
The high-temperature susceptibility well obeys the Curie-Weiss behavior:
χ=χ₀+C/(T−θ), where χ₀ denotes the temperature-independent term, C is
the Curie-Weiss constant, and θ is the paramagnetic Curie temperature.
The data fitting (50 < T< 200 K) shows that the effective moment is
close to the theoretical value g$\sqrt{S(S+1)}$μ_(B)=7.94μ_(B) (S = 7/2
and g = 2) for a free Eu²⁺ ion. The θ values are positive, suggesting
ferromagnetic interaction among Eu²⁺ spins.

Although the high-temperature susceptibility is basically isotropic,
χ_(ab) is obviously higher than χ_(c) at low temperatures, e.g.,
χ_(ab)/χ_(c) is about 3.5 at 17 K. This suggests that the easy
magnetization direction is parallel to the ab planes, similar to the
case in EuFe₂As₂.[17] Below T_(M)=17 K, χ_(ab) decreases rather sharply,
indicating an antiferromagneticlike transition. On the other hand, χ_(c)
remains nearly constant below T_(M). Therefore, one concludes that the
Eu²⁺ moments are perpendicular to the c axis below T_(M). Considering
the dominant ferromagnetic interaction among Eu²⁺ spins, one expects
ferromagnetic arrangement for the Eu²⁺ spins within single Eu²⁺ layer.
This is quite similar to the situation in EuFe₂As₂ (Ref. [17]); in
latter case the magnetic ordering temperature is 2 K higher.

However, we note that the magnitude of drop in χ_(ab) is much smaller,
compared with EuFe₂As₂ crystals.[17] The residual susceptibility at zero
temperature is about 2/3 of $\chi_{\rm max}$ at T_(M), irrespective of
changing the relative orientation between the sample and the applied
field within ab planes. In addition, the field dependence of
magnetization shows only a spin reorientation process for H∥ab (see Fig.
9), in contrast with the steplike magnetization curves in EuFe₂As₂.[17]
Both results suggest the noncollinear alignment for Eu²⁺ spins, although
lying in the ab planes. Therefore, we propose a helical magnetic order
for Eu²⁺ moments in Eu(Fe_(0.89)Co_(0.11))₂As₂, i.e., the moments of the
neighboring FM Eu²⁺ layers form an angle of φ (φ ≠ n π, where n is an
integer). Such a noncollinear magnetic order was first observed in the
1950s in MnAu₂,[32] in which the FM basal planes of Mn atoms are
sandwiched by two layers of Au atoms.

The Eu-interlayer spacing is so large that interlayer magnetic coupling
should be an indirect RKKY interaction, which has much longer range and
changes its sign with the distance and Fermi wave vector. In the
framework of RKKY interaction, the above noncollinear HM is possible if
considering both nearest-neighboring and next-nearest-neighboring (along
the c axis) interlayer couplings. According to a simplified
derivation,[33]

$$\cos\,\varphi=-\,\frac{J_{\rm NN}}{4J_{\rm NN}}.$$
(1)

The above solution corresponds to helimagnetic order, when
$|J_{\rm NN}|$<$|4J_{\rm NN}|$. Here, we note that the HM is compatible
with the SC order, as theoretical work[9] pointed out.

Due to the proximity of superconducting transition and magnetic
ordering, the superconducting diamagnetic signal could be very weak. The
huge paramagnetic background from Eu²⁺ spins also makes it difficult to
directly observe the diamagnetism. To find the signal of SC, we carried
out the low-field susceptibility measurement, as shown in Fig. 7. For
H∥ab, the magnetic transition temperature decreases even by a small
field of 500 Oe. When the field is less than 10 Oe, an increase in χ can
be observed at 13 K. Such an anomaly is

susceptibility for Eu(Fe_(0.89)Co_(0.11))₂As₂. The measurements were

pronounced with decreasing field. Thus, we made a subtraction:
Δχ=χ₂${}_{\rm Oe}$−χ₅${}_{\rm Oe}$, as shown in the inset. One sees an
abrupt decrease at 21 K, corresponding to the resistivity drop in Fig.
2. This result is reproducible for the subtractions using different
$\chi_{\rm H}(T)$ data. Furthermore, the subtraction of
$\chi_{\rm FC}(T)$ from $\chi_{\rm ZFC}(T)$ also gives evidence of SC
below 21 K. The "dimensiontism" in the paramagnetic background suggests
SC in Eu(Fe_(0.89)Co_(0.11))₂As₂. The absence of bulk Meissner effect,
similar to the case in EuFe₂(As_(0.7)P_(0.3))₂,[23] should be associated
with the magnetic ordering of Eu²⁺ spins. Theoretical work[34] indicates
that, in the limit of large saturated magnetic moment and magnetic
anisotropy, there will be no Meissner effect. In that case, the
effective lower critical field H_(c1) will be zero and superconductivity
appears only when vortices are pinned to impurity sites. In fact, the
above difference in $\chi_{\rm H}(T)$ for H=2 and 5 Oe suggests that
H_(c1) is really much lower than expected.

Here, we have to address another anomaly in Δχ, i.e., the increase at 13
K. This phenomenon is reminiscent of paramagnetic Meissner effect (PME).
Intrinsic PME can be produced from a spontaneous flux in a SC loop made
of Josephson junction with superconducting phase difference.[35] In the
SC and HM coexisted state, similar junctions can be possibly formed due
to the proximity effect in SC-FM boundaries.[36] Therefore, spontaneous
flux could be generated mostly parallel to ab planes. This could result
in the observed PME for H∥ab. In the case of H⊥ab, the SC transition at
21 K can also be clearly seen. However, the PME-like transition is not
so obvious, consistent with the spontaneous flux perpendicular to the c
axis.

Figure 8 shows the temperature dependence of magnetization under fixed
magnetic fields. For both H∥ab and H⊥ab, $T_{\rm HM}$ decreases with the
field. Compared with $T_{\rm HM}^{\perp}$, $T_{\rm HM}^{\parallel}$ is
more easily suppressed by the magnetic fields. The variations of
$T_{\rm HM}$ coincide with the changes in $T_{\rm ret}$ (shown in Fig.
3), suggesting that the resistivity re-entrance is closely related to
the helimagnetic transitions. The decrease in $T_{\rm HM}$ by external
fields can be qualitatively understood in terms of the above simple
model considering the interlayer magnetic couplings $J_{\rm NN}$ and
$J_{\rm NNN}$. Under magnetic fields, the effective coupling is modified
as $J_{\rm eff}$=J+$J_{\rm ext}$ ($J_{\rm ext}$ denotes the contribution
from the applied field). Thus, the applied field possibly makes the
inequality $|J_{\rm NN,eff}|$<|$4J_{\rm NN,eff}|$ invalid (note that
$|J_{\rm NN,eff}|$=$|J_{\rm NN}$+$J_{\rm ext}|$,
$|4J_{\rm NN,eff}|$=$|J_{\rm NN}$+$J_{\rm ext}|$), leading to the
appearance of a more stabilized FM phase.

Under higher magnetic field, the HM-FM transition can be verified by the
saturation of magnetization to a fully polarized value g=7.0μ_(B)/f.u.
(g=2 and S=7/2). Here, we identify the FM transition temperature
$T_{\rm Curie}$ as the inflection point of the M(T) curves. The
derivative of magnetization, plotted in the inset of Fig. 8, indicates
that $T_{\rm Curie}$ increases with the field.

Figure 9 shows the isothermal magnetization for the
Eu(Fe_(0.89)Co_(0.11))₂As₂ crystals. At 2 K, the magnetization in

creases almost linearly until achieving the saturated value of
7.0$\mu_{\rm g}$/f.u. for both directions of magnetic fields. The
M_(c)(H) behavior resembles that of EuFe₂As₂, except for the smaller
saturated field H_(s)⁺. However, the M_(ab)(H) curve is qualitatively
different from its counterpart of EuFe₂As₂ crystals. The latter shows a
steplike magnetization at 2 K, which was identified as a metamagnetic
transition associated with a spin-flip process.[17] Since the spin flip
is related to the A-type antiferromagnetic structure, the absence of
steplike magnetization in Eu(Fe_(0.89)Co_(0.11))₂As₂ points to the
helimagnetic structure proposed above.

The magnetic state of Eu²⁺ moments correlates with the ρ(H) data shown
in Fig. 5. At H=H_(s)=H⁺ and T< 17 K, a turning point can also be found
in the ρ(H) curve. This observation reveals the interplay between SC and
the magnetism of Eu²⁺. For H>H_(s), the Eu²⁺ spins are fully aligned
along the magnetic field. Thus, the magnetic state is basically
homogeneous. Under this circumstance, superconductivity could survive in
the form of superconducting vortices. The electric current through the
sample will result in the dissipative motion of the vortex, thus showing
nonzero resistance. In the HM state (H<H_(s)), one expects noncollinear
vortex, which could lead to a possibly larger dissipation. This is a
plausible explanation we can figure out at present for the resistivity
re-entrance shown in Fig. 3.

### Phase diagram

Based on the above experimental results, the magnetic and
superconducting phase diagrams were summarized as shown in Fig. 10.
There are five different types of phase regimes. The first is
paramagnetic normal state, located at the upper region in the phase
diagrams. The second is paramagnetic superconducting state, which has a
small area with narrow ranges of temperature and field. In the third
state, located at the lower left side, SC coexists with the helimagnetic
ordering of Eu²⁺ moments. The fourth is FM normal state, stabilized by
external magnetic fields. The last phase shows the coexistence of SC and
FM states, where spontaneous vortex phase is expected. As can be seen,
the phase boundaries are obviously different for H∥ab and H∥c. However,
both cases show five states in terms of magnetic ordering of Eu²⁺ spins
and SC associated with Fe 3d electrons.

## IV Concluding remarks

In summary, we have measured the resistivity and magnetization under
magnetic fields on Eu(Fe_(0.89)Co_(0.11))₂As₂ single crystals. Evidence
of superconducting transition at 21 K was given from low-field magnetic
susceptibility as well

as (magneto)resistivity. Below 17 K, Eu2+ moments are most likely
helically ordered under low magnetic fields, which cause resistivity
re-entrance. The Eu2+ moments can be easily reorientated by the external
fields, exhibiting the coexistence of SC and FM states.

There are still some open questions in the present study. One is the
origin of large nonzero resistance. While it is possible that
spontaneous vortex accounts for the nonzero resistance, direct evidence
of spontaneous vortex is called for. The other is the low-field magnetic
susceptibility anomaly at 13 K. Whether it is truly a PME and is
originated from spontaneous flux is of great interest. Here, we suggest
that low-temperature magnetic force microscopy and scanning
superconducting quantum interference device technique should be
employed. Furthermore, specific electrical transport properties such as
Hall and Nernst coefficients could be helpful to resolve the above
issues.
