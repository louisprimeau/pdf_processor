###### Abstract

A newly discovered family of high-$T_{\rm c}$ Fe-based superconductors,
$A_{\rm c}$Fe₄As₄ ($A_{\rm c}$ = Ca, Sr, Eu and A = K, Rb, Cs), offers
further opportunities to understand unconventional superconductivity in
these materials. In this Rapid Communication, we report on the
superconducting and magnetic properties of CaKFe₄As₄, studied using muon
spectroscopy. Zero-field muon spin relaxation studies carried out on the
CaKFe₄As₄ superconductor do not show any detectable magnetic anomaly at
$T_{\rm c}$ or below, implying that time-reversal symmetry is preserved
in the superconducting ground state. The temperature dependence of the
superfluid density of CaKFe₄As₄ is found to be compatible with a two-gap
s + s-wave model with gap values of 8.6(4) and 2.5(3) meV, similar to
the other Fe-based superconductors. The presence of two superconducting
energy gaps is consistent with theoretical and other experimental
studies on this material. The value of the penetration depth at T = 0 K
has been determined as 289(22) nm.

Recent years have witnessed huge research interest in Fe-based
superconductors not only due to a higher superconducting transition
temperature $T_{\rm c}$, but also because of the unconventional
superconducting properties and interplay with various electronic ground
states, such as nematic phase and magnetism [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. This family
has a diverse range of structures, all containing a common Fe₂An₂ (An =
P, As, Se, Te) layer, analogous to the CuO₂ layers in high-$T_{\rm c}$
cuprates [6]. $A_{\rm c}$AFe₄As₄ ($A_{\rm c}$ = Ca, Sr, Eu and A = K,
Rb, Cs) materials, discovered in 2016, are the new family of Fe-based
superconductors with a $T_{\rm c}$ of ≈31-36 K [7]. Until now, only a
few experimental studies have been performed which show that this new
family of superconductors is structurally identical to CaFe₂As₂, with
the $A_{\rm c}$ and A sites forming alternating planes along the
crystallographic c axis, separated by FeAs layers [7]. Unlike other
Fe-based superconductors, $A_{\rm c}$AFe₄As₄ does not show any
structural phase transition below room temperature [8]. However,
Eu-containing $A_{\rm c}$AFe₄As₄ show a magnetic transition at ≈15 K [9,
10]. Along with high-$T_{\rm c}$ values, the $A_{\rm c}$AFe₄As₄ family
also shows a very high upper critical field (≈92 T for CaKFe₄As₄) [11],
similar to the optimally doped (Ba,K)Fe₂As₂[12] which is well above the
Pauli paramagnetic limit $H_{\rm p}(0)=1.86T_{\rm c}$ for weak-coupling
BCS superconductors. Measurements of the London penetration depth λ(T)
using a tunnel-diode resonator (TDR) and tunneling conductance from a
scanning tunneling microscope (STM) show two nodeless gaps in CaKFe₄As₄
with a larger gap of between 6 and 9 meV and a smaller gap of between 1
and 4 meV [13]. High-resolution angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and density functional theory (DFT)
calculations support multiband superconductivity in CaKFe₄As₄, in which
Cooper pairs form in the electron and the hole bands interacting via a
dominant interband repulsive interaction enhanced by Fermi surface (FS)
nesting [14]. Other thermodynamic and transport measurements on
CaKFe₄As₄, such as resistivity, thermoelectric power, Hall effect,
magnetization, and specific heat, etc., all show similar properties to
the optimally doped (Ba${}_{1-\rm K}$,${}_{\rm J}$Fe₂As₂[8]. This fully
ordered and stoichiometric $A_{\rm c}$AFe₄As₄ family of superconductors
with high-$T_{\rm c}$ values therefore provides new and unique
opportunities to test and compare the experimental and theoretical
understanding of the Fe-based superconductors. In addition, the ordered
nature of the structure makes theoretical models easier to develop. In
this respect, it is of critical importance to understand the
superconducting and magnetic properties of CaKFe₄As₄ and obtain detailed
knowledge of the superconducting order parameters.

In this Rapid Communication, we report the results from muon spin
rotation and relaxation (μSR) studies on the superconducting and
magnetic properties of CaKFe₄As₄ at the microscopic level. We have
investigated the symmetry of the superconducting gap of CaKFe₄As₄ by
measuring the magnetic penetration depth as a function of temperature
λ(T). Our results show that CaKFe₄As₄ is a nodeless multigap
superconductor with gap sizes of 8.6(4) and 2.5(3) meV. We also obtained
the penetration depth at 0 K, λ(0) = 289(22) nm. Using the zero-field
(ZF)-μSR technique we confirm that CaKFe₄As₄ is paramagnetic in the
normal state. It further shows that the superconducting state of
CaKFe₄As₄ preserves time-reversal symmetry (TRS).

Polycrystalline samples of CaKFe₄As₄ were synthesized using the
stainless steel (SUS) pipe and cap method described in Ref. [7]. Sample
characterization measurements (not shown here) were performed at the
National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST),
Japan. Zero-field (ZF)- and transverse-field (TF)-μSR experiments were
carried out using the MuSR spectrometer [15] at the ISIS facility, STFC
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, U.K. Powder samples of CaKFe₄As₄ were
pressed into six pellets of diameter 6 mm and thickness ≈1 mm each. For
measurements in the ZF mode, a mosaic of the six pellets was mounted
onto a 99.995

ZF-μSR measurements were performed to investigate the magnetic
properties of the CaKFe₄As₄ superconductor, especially to look for any
additional magnetic signal arising spontaneously with the onset of
superconductivity, associated with time-reversal symmetry breaking
fields. Figure 1(a) shows the ZF-μSR time spectra measured at T = 1.65
and 35 K. ZF data collected above and below $T_{\rm c}$ show a
negligible difference, implying that there is no additional relaxation
of the μSR signal appearing in the superconducting state of CaKFe₄As₄.
The data were analyzed using the Kubo-Toyabe relaxation function [18]
multiplied by an exponential decay function with a decay rate Λ,

$$A(t)=A(0)\left\{\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{3}(1-a^{2}t^{2})\exp\left(-\frac{a^{2}t^ {2}}{2}\right)\right\}\exp(-\Lambda t),$$
(1)

where A(0) is the initial asymmetry, and a and Λ are muon spin
relaxation rates of the nuclear and electronic moments, respectively.
Since we expect that the contribution from the nuclear moments will be
similar above and below $T_{\rm c}$, a was kept as a common parameter
for all temperature data. The fits yield a = 0.045(2) μs⁻¹, which is
very small and reflects the presence of random local fields arising from
the nuclear moments within CaKFe₄As₄. Figure 1(b) shows that Λ is nearly
temperature independent across $T_{\rm c}$ and therefore rules out the
presence of any magnetic anomaly in the superconducting state of
CaKFe₄As₄. The small values of Λ are consistent with the presence of
diluted and randomly oriented electronic moments in this material. A 5
mT longitudinal field (LF) is sufficient to decouple the remaining
moments completely [see Fig. 1(a)], which further suggests that these
moments are static in nature. All the ZF-μSR time spectra could be
fitted with a single asymmetry function, implying that CaKFe₄As₄ is
fully paramagnetic in the normal state.

Figure 2 shows the TF-μSR time spectra collected at 1.6 and 35 K in a TF
of 40 mT. As expected, the muon spin depolarization rate in the
superconducting state (1.6 K data) is much stronger than in the normal
state (35 K data) due to the spatial field modulation of the flux line
lattice, formed in the mixed state of CaKFe₄As₄. All these responses can
be described by an oscillatory term with a Gaussian envelope,

$$A^{\rm TF}(t)= A(0)\exp(-\sigma^{2}t^{2}/2)\cos(\gamma_{\mu}(B)t+\phi)$$
$$+A_{\rm bg}(0)\cos(\gamma_{\mu}B_{\rm bf}t+\phi),$$

using Eq. (2).

where A(0) and $A_{\rm hg}(0)$ are the initial asymmetries of the sample
and background signals, γ_(μ)/2π = 135.5 MHz/T is the muon gyromagnetic
ratio [19], ⟨B⟩ and $B_{\rm hg}$ are the internal and background
magnetic fields, ϕ is the initial phase of the muon precession signal,
and σ is the Gaussian muon spin relaxation rate. σ represents the second
moment of the internal field distribution. It is worthwhile to mention
here that our background signals are very small due to the hematite
slabs mounted immediately after the sample. Any muons missing the sample
are implanted into the hematite slabs which then depolarize quickly
within a few nanoseconds and appear as an asymmetry loss in the TF-μSR
signals. A very small background signal most probably originates from a
small number of muons hitting the Ag sample holder and is assumed to be
nonrelaxing over the muon time window, an assumption supported by
ZF-μSR.

Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of σ for CaKFe₄As₄ which
exhibits a pronounced increase below $T_{\rm c}$. Figure 3(b) shows the
expected diamagnetic shift below $T_{\rm c}$ in the form of an internal
magnetic field strength at the muon site in CaKFe₄As₄. σ can be
expressed as
$\sigma=(\sigma_{\rm sc}^{2}+\sigma_{\rm nm}^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}}$, where
$\sigma_{\rm sc}$ is the superconducting contribution to the relaxation
rate due to the inhomogeneous field variation across the flux line
lattice and $\sigma_{\rm nm}$ is the nuclear magnetic dipolar
contribution which is assumed to be temperature independent.

In light of the Ginzburg-Landau treatment of the vortex state, Brandt
[20] has shown that for a superconductor with a hexagonal vortex lattice
and very high upper critical field, $\sigma_{\rm sc}$ is related to the
penetration depth λ by the simplified Brandt equation,

$$\frac{\sigma_{\rm sc}(T)}{\gamma_{\mu}}=0.06091\frac{\Phi_{0}}{\lambda^{2}(T)},$$
(3)

where Φ₀ = 2.068 × 10⁻¹⁵ Wb is the flux quantum [20]. λ⁻²(T) is
proportional to the effective superfluid density ρ_(s) ∝ λ⁻² and hence
carries the information about the symmetry and size of a superconducting
gap. Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of λ⁻² for CaKFe₄As₄. The
fits to the λ⁻²(T) data were made using either a single-gap or a
combination of two-gap models using the following functional form [21,
22],

$$\frac{\lambda^{-2}(T)}{\lambda^{-2}(0)}=\omega\frac{\lambda^{-2}[T,\Delta_{1}( 0)]}{\lambda^{-2}[0,\Delta_{1}(0)]}+(1-\omega)\frac{\lambda^{-2}[T,\Delta_{2}( 0)]}{\lambda^{-2}[0,\Delta_{2}(0)]},$$
(4)

where λ(0) is the value of the penetration depth at T = 0 K, Δ_(i)(0) is
the value of the ith (i = 1 or 2) superconducting gap at T = 0 K, and ω
is the weighting factor of the first gap.

Each component of Eq. (4) can be expressed within the local London
approximation (λ ≫ ξ) [23, 24] as

$$\frac{\lambda^{-2}(T,\Delta_{0,i})}{\lambda^{-2}(0,\Delta_{0,i})}=1+\frac{1}{ \pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{\Delta_{T,\sigma_{\rm sc}}}^{\infty}\left(\frac{ \partial f}{\partial E}\right)\frac{EdEd\varphi}{\sqrt{E^{2}-\Delta_{i}(T, \varphi)^{2}}},$$
(5)

where $f=[1+\exp{(E/k_{\rm B}T)}]^{-1}$ is the Fermi function, φ is the
angle along the Fermi surface, and Δ_(i)(T, φ) = Δ_(0, i)δ(T/T_(c))g(φ),
where g(φ) describes the angular dependence of the gap. The temperature
dependence of the gap can be approximated by the expression
$\delta(T/T_{\rm c})=\tanh{\{1.82[1.018(T_{c}/T-1)\}^{0.51}]}$[21].

The solid curves shown in Fig. 4 are fits to the λ⁻²(T) data from
CaKFe₄As₄ using a single-gap s-wave and two-gap s + s-wave models. For
simplicity, we have not shown the fitted curves corresponding to
anisotropic s- and s + d-wave

s + s-wave models.

models in Fig. 4. All the fitted parameters are summarized in Table 1.
The two-gap s + s-wave gap model gives a lower
$\gamma_{\rm reduced}^{2}$ value than any other above-mentioned model,
and gives a much better fit to the data compared to the single-gap
s-wave model with gap values of 8.6(4) and 2.5(3) meV and λ(0) = 289(22)
nm. Therefore, it can be concluded that CaKFe₄As₄ is a multiple-gap
superconductor which is consistent with other layered Fe-based
superconductors [5, 25, 26, 27]. Some other well-known examples of
multigap superconductivity are represented by MgB₂, NbSe₂, and
Lu₂Fe₃Si₅[28, 29, 30, 31]. The two-gap model, used here to analyze our
final results, is a very simple approach to describe multiple
superconducting gaps in the pairing symmetry data and has been used
extensively in the past. For example, a similar model has also been used
by Niedermayer _et al._ to investigate the symmetry and values of the
superconducting gaps in MgB₂[32].

The superconducting gap values obtained from the two-gap model fits are
in excellent agreement with the reported values obtained from the STM
measurements for this material [13] and also consistent with other
layered Fe-based superconductors, especially from the μSR and ARPES
measurements of an optimally doped (Ba,K,Rb)Fe₂As₂ system [33, 34].
These are, however, more than double the values reported from the TDR
measurements of CaKFe₄As₄[13]. Our finding of two superconducting gaps
in CaKFe₄As₄ is not unsurprising and is very much consistent with other
members of Fe-based superconductors. It is now a universal phenomenon
across all Fe-based superconductors, apart from a small number of
exceptions, such as the highly electron-doped regime of (Ba,K,Rb)Fe₂As₂
system.

In summary, ZF- and TF-μSR measurements have been performed on
CaKFe₄As₄, a member of the newly discovered family of high-$T_{\rm c}$
Fe-based superconductors A_(e)AFe₄As₄ (A_(e) = Ca, Sr, Eu and A = K, Rb,
Cs). ZF-μSR data confirm that there is no magnetic anomaly in the
superconducting ground state of CaKFe₄As₄. The temperature dependence of
the magnetic penetration depth is found to be strongly compatible with a
two-gap s + s-wave model with gap values Δ₁(0) = 8.6(4) meV and
Δ₂(0) = 2.5(3) meV with a weighting factor ω = 0.68(4) to the large gap.
We obtain the penetration depth λ(0) = 289(22) nm. Our results show that
CaKFe₄As₄ is a fully developed nodeless multigap superconductor and all
the fitted gap parameters are very similar to the optimally doped
(Ba,K,Rb)Fe₂As₂ systems. Further studies are in progress to explore the
pressure evolution of the symmetry of the superconducting gaps in this
materials.

The μSR experiments were performed at the ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon
Source, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (STFC, United Kingdom).
