###### Abstract

Heat capacity, resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility measurements
confirm bulk superconductivity in single crystals of BaIr₂P₂ (T_(c)=2.1
K) and BaRh₂P₂ (T_(c)=1.0 K). These compounds form in the ThCr₂Si₂ (122)
structure so they are isostructural to both the Ni and Fe pnictides but
not isoelectronic to either of them. This illustrates the importance of
structure for the occurrence of superconductivity in the 122 pnictides.
Additionally, a comparison between these and other ternary phosphide
superconductors suggests that the lack of interlayer P-P bonding favors
superconductivity. These stoichiometric and ambient pressure
superconductors offer an ideal playground to investigate the role of
structure for the mechanism of superconductivity in the absence of
magnetism.

BaIr₂P₂ were too small for reliable heat capacity and magnetization
measurements, so these were carried out on polycrystalline pellets.

The temperature (T) dependence of resistivity (ρ) in single crystals of
BaIr₂P₂ and BaRh₂P₂ is shown in Fig. 2(a) from 300 down to 0.5 K. The
high quality of crystals is evidenced by the large residual resistivity
ratios (RRR =ρ(300 K) /ρ(3 K) =16.5 in BaIr₂P₂ and 7.5 in BaRh₂P₂) as
well as by the low values of the residual resistivities (8.7 and 1.2 μΩ
cm in Ir and Rh samples). In both systems, ρ(T) exhibits a T-linear
dependence above 100 K without any sign of saturation up to 300 K. There
is no evidence for structural or magnetic transitions in ρ up to 300 K.
At low temperatures, a sharp drop to ρ=0 indicates the onset of SC at
T_(c) =2.1 K in BaIr₂P₂ and 1 K in BaRh₂P₂.

The temperature and magnetic field dependence of magnetization (M) are
shown in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c) for polycrystalline BaIr₂P₂. The
diamagnetic jump in M(T) corresponds to the same T_(c) as determined
from ρ(T). The magnetization loop M(H) at 1.8 K shows hysteresis and
rather broad extrema. The average of their field positions (necessary
due to trapped flux in the magnet) yields 45 Oe as an upper bound for
the lower critical field H_(c1) (we adopt the type-II SC scheme since
the critical field determined by ρ(T,H) and C(T,H) is significantly
higher; see below). The slope of M(H) below H_(c1) is used to estimate
that 100

The bulk nature of SC is also confirmed with a sharp anomaly in C(T),
observed in both compounds [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)]. The good agreement
between the thermodynamic and resistive T_(c) and the sharpness of the
transition even for the polycrystalline sample imply that T_(c) does not
show any distribution. At zero field, the ratio
$\frac{\Delta C}{\gamma T_{c}}$ equals 1.41 and 1.17 for BaIr₂P₂ and
BaRh₂P₂, consistent with Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. The
values of the electronic specific heat coefficient γ are obtained from a
linear fit to $\frac{\Gamma}{\gamma}$ vs T² in the range 0.4-2.4 K
(BaIr₂P₂) and 0.5-1.0 K (BaRh₂P₂) (see Table 1). The γ and T_(c) shown
here are consistent with those reported on polycrystals.[25]

The suppression of T_(c) with magnetic field is seen in
$\frac{\Gamma}{\gamma}$(T) [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)] and ρ(T) [Figs. 3(c)
and 3(d)]. In both compounds, the superconducting transition in ρ(T)
remains rather sharp, even under magnetic fields as high as 200 Oe
=$\frac{H_{c2}}{2}$. This suggests a rather strongly pinned vortex
lattice. The specific-heat anomaly also remains sharp for the BaRh₂P₂
single crystals up to 150 Oe [see Fig. 3(b)] but broadens with field for
the polycrystalline BaIr₂P₂ [see Fig. 3(a)]. The possible anisotropy of
the upper critical field has not been investigated and might be
responsible for this broadening. The corresponding H-T phase diagram is
shown in Fig. 4. There is a good agreement between the values obtained
from resistivity and specific heat for both compounds. The use of the
approximation H_(c2)(0)
=−0.7T_(c)$\frac{\partial H_{c2}}{\partial T}|_{T_{c}}$ yields
H_(c2)(0)=410 and 370 Oe in BaIr₂P₂ and BaRh₂P₂. These values of
H_(c2)(0) are comparable to SrNi₂P₂(390 Oe)[16] and BaNi₂P₂(550 Oe)[15]
but

smaller than those cited in the study of Hirai _et al._[25] The
broadness of the transitions in polycrystals [25] may be the source of
the discrepancies. From our values of H_(c2)(0) we estimate the
coherence lengths to be 80 and 95 nm for BaIr₂P₂ and BaRh₂P₂,
respectively.

Figure 3(d) shows a pronounced upturn in ρ(T) preceding the onset of the
superconducting jump in BaRh₂P₂. The resistivity rises about 100% in the
temperature interval 1.35-1 K at zero field. The onset of the upturn is
suppressed with magnetic field but its amplitude is unaffected.
Moreover, this suppression does not appear to be correlated with the
upper critical field H_(c2)(T), as seen in Fig. 4, suggesting separate
phenomena. We have verified that the upturn is present in a second
crystal of BaRh₂P₂ of similar RRR, as well as in a polycrystalline
pellet, but found that the amplitude of the upturn is sample dependent.
A smaller upturn is also observed in single crystal BaIr₂P₂ above 700
Oe, but it is absent at zero field in this case. Such an upturn is also
reported in SrNi₂P₂[16] and LaFePO. [26] In addition, a sample-dependent
Curie tail has been frequently observed in the low-temperature
susceptibility, with an associated Brillouin-type behavior in M vs H for
single crystals of both compounds (not shown). The sample-to-sample
variation in this magnetic behavior is suggestive of an extrinsic
origin, although the corresponding concentration of spin 1/2 is far in
excess of the level of magnetic impurities contained in the starting
materials (≤20 ppm). Their origin remains unclear and is beyond the
scope of this Rapid Communication.

We now turn to the relationship between the 122 structure and SC in
pnictides. BaFe₂As₂ is a prime example of the flexibility of this
structure on the route to SC: it has been shown that pressure and doping
on all three atomic sites have independently induced SC. [4; 9; 10; 27]
However, in the isoelectronic CaFe₂As₂ the existence of SC is highly
controversial. [28; 29] Moreover, in CaFe₂As₂, recent theoretical
calculations show an intimate connection between the Fe-spin state and
the interlayer As-As bonding. [30] Future studies should clarify the
effect of the Fe moments on T_(c). In addition, BaRh₂As₂ exhibits no
superconductivity down to 1.8 K. [31] Thus, the relationship between the
tetragonal structure and SC is not clear at present in the 122
arsenides. The present phosphides allow the investigation of the
relationship between SC and structure without the interference of
magnetism since neither Rh nor Ir is intrinsically magnetic.

In the ternary phosphides there is an isostructural transition into a
collapsed tetragonal structure, [18] similar to CaFe₂As₂, [28; 29]
except that it does not appear to be associated with any magnetic order.
[16] Previous investigations in BaRh₂P₂ did not show any structural
transition up to 11 GPa and down to low temperatures [18] (no reports
for BaIr₂P₂). In the phosphides, unlike the arsenides, proximity to a
structural transition is not a prerequisite for SC. It is known that
this isostructural transition corresponds to the formation or breaking
of a bond between the interlayer P atoms. [32] In the absence of P-P
bond, the cohesion of the layers is due to the Coulomb attraction
through the intermediate A²⁺ cation. [33] The critical distance for bond
formation obtained theoretically is about d_(c)∼ 2.8 A between the
interlayer P atoms, labeled d_(p-p) in the inset of Fig. 1. [33] We
found that both BaRh₂P₂ and BaIr₂P₂ have a d_(p-p) of ∼3.7 A (see
Table 1) indicating the absence of interlayer bonding between the P
atoms, which is consistent with structural calculations. [32] In
contrast, CaRh₂P₂ has a d_(p-p) of only 2.25 A, which is below the
critical distance for bond formation. We have also grown single crystals
of CaRh₂P₂ and found no evidence of SC down to 0.55 K. This suggests
that the absence of bonds favors SC.

The absence of P-P bonds is also found in other superconducting
phosphides, such as BaNi₂P₂ which has d_(p-p)=3.71 A. [34] In fact, none
of the known ternary phosphides [BaIr₂P₂, BaRh₂P₂, BaNi₂P₂, [15] and
LaRu₂P₂[14]] that exhibit ambient pressure SC in the tetragonal
structure are bonded between the interlayer P atoms. Nevertheless, it is
interesting that LaRu₂P₂, with the highest T_(c) at 4.1 K, lies closest
(3.00 A) to the theoretical structural instability while

still being in the nonbonding state.[14] However, SrNi₂P₂ shows SC in
the collapsed tetragonal phase under pressure where a bond exists
between the layers.[16] Since the ambient pressure orthorhombic phase is
also superconducting, it is hard to assess the importance of the
structure for SC in this case. De Haas-van Alphen results of BaNi₂P₂
show a three-dimensional (3D) Fermi surface dominated by the Ni d bands,
indicating that the effect of interlayer coupling on the electronic
dimensionality is small.[35] Our results lay the groundwork for more
theoretical investigations in order to clarify the relationship between
the interlayer bonding and the mechanism for SC in the nonmagnetic 122
phosphides.

In conclusion, we have shown the existence of bulk weak coupling SC in
122 pnictides in the Co column of the periodic table with nonmagnetic
transition metals Rh and Ir. This emphasizes the importance of the 122
structure and the robustness of SC with respect to changes in the
electronic configuration, opening the door for SC in other non-Fe-based
compounds. Also, these findings suggest that the lack of interlayer
bonding favors SC. It is important to understand how the structure
affects SC in the ternary and quaternary pnictides in the absence of
competing magnetic order. Due to the apparent lack of magnetism, BaIr₂P₂
and BaRh₂P₂ provide convenient systems in which to study the interplay
between structure and SC.
